1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,923
(<i> birds chirping</i> )

2
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:07,716
Good morning, children.

3
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:10,344
I'm your new governess,
Mrs. Davenport.

4
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:14,222
Too formal.

5
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:18,727
Henry, Beatrice,
I'm so glad to meet you.

6
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,689
I've heard so much about you,

7
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,901
and I'm sure we're going to be
very good friends.

8
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,110
( scoffs )

9
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,612
Too familiar.

10
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,868
Hello.
I'm Mrs. Davenport.

11
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:35,828
Your father
has asked me here

12
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:37,371
to be your new governess.

13
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:40,207
Something he did without
mentioning it to us.

14
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,083
Good morning, children.

15
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,920
It's good to see you.

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,964
You must be Henry,

17
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:51,050
and this... is Beatrice.

18
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,764
Henry Burleigh,

19
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,933
Viscount Timmins.

20
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:02,938
My sister,
the Lady Beatrice Flora.

21
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:05,607
You will address us
as "milord" and "milady."

22
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,027
Of course, milord.

23
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,238
Please, sit down.

24
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,866
Let's get to know one another,
shall we?

25
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:18,161
I am Mrs. Davenport.

26
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,747
I hope to be
a friend to you

27
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,289
as well as a governess.

28
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,959
<i>In ullam</i>
<i>rem ne properemus.</i>

29
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,377
I beg your pardon?

30
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:28,672
<i>In ullam rem ne properemus.</i>

31
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:31,425
Is your Latin a bit rusty?

32
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:35,596
I... suppose it is.

33
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:36,889
Then I don't see how

34
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:39,016
you'll be doing
my lessons with me.

35
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:45,522
Milord, I assure you
that I am more than qualified

36
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,024
to instruct you.

37
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:49,777
I may have to brush up
on my Latin,

38
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:52,863
but when it comes to mathematics
and the sciences,

39
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:56,992
I'm sure you'll find
my lessons challenging.

40
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,788
And Beatrice...

41
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,917
...what do you
like to study?

42
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:06,543
Nothing.

43
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,755
Not even painting
or needlework?

44
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,967
I just made my first sampler.

45
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,969
I finished it yesterday.

46
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:18,346
Did you? Oh, I'd love
to see it sometime.

47
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,723
I don't have it anymore.

48
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,433
I gave it to Mother.

49
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:22,726
HENRY:
Beatrice...

50
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:25,062
My sister is confused.

51
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,814
She gave the sampler
to Mother

52
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,398
before she died.

53
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,650
No, I didn't.

54
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,359
I gave it to her last night.

55
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,569
Beatrice!

56
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,737
I talked to her.

57
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,990
Beatrice is upset,
Mrs. Davenport.

58
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,409
She hasn't yet accepted
our mother's death.

59
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,497
Beatrice...

60
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:47,542
I know it was a terrible thing
to lose your mother.

61
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,752
She's not dead!

62
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,546
I saw her last night!

63
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,758
What have you done to my sister?

64
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,638
Computer, restore characters
in program Janeway Lambda-1.

65
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,473
COMPUTER:
<i>Unable to comply.</i>

66
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,350
<i>There has been</i>
<i>a disruption of power</i>

67
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,687
<i>to energy grid Beta 4.</i>

68
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,188
Janeway to Bridge. Report.
CHAKOTAY:<i> We're experiencing</i>

69
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,025
power fluctuations
on Deck 6, Captain.

70
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,275
Mr. Tuvok is investigating.

71
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,154
<i>Keep me informed.</i>
<i>Janeway out.</i>

72
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,162
Tuvok to Lieutenant Torres.

73
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:26,205
Has any equipment repair
been authorized on Deck 6?

74
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,666
Negative. What's going on?

75
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,878
Stand by.

76
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,838
Be careful!

77
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:35,716
Sorry. You might have broken
the connection.

78
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,177
Crewman Dalby, what
are you doing here?

79
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:40,804
Oh, one of the bio-neural
gel packs was malfunctioning.

80
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,263
I had to replace it.

81
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,100
Did you inform
Lieutenant Torres?
Well, not yet.

82
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,102
I was just going to take this
to Engineering for analysis.

83
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,771
On this ship,
we have a protocol
for such procedures.

84
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,398
I was in the area,

85
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,816
I saw a malfunctioning
gel pack,

86
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:53,817
and I fixed it.

87
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,027
What's the problem?

88
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,319
Your repair interrupted

89
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,738
a number of
ship's functions.

90
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,364
That is the problem.

91
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,366
I guess I'm used to doing things
a little differently.

92
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,826
On our ship,
when something went wrong

93
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,452
you fixed it.

94
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,913
I would remind you, Mr. Dalby,

95
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,789
that you are no longer
on a Maquis ship.

96
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,624
I'm well aware of that,
Lieutenant,

97
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,794
and every minute of every day
I regret it.

98
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,839
I was just trying to do my job--
trying to help out.

99
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,258
If that goes against
Starfleet's almighty rules,

100
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,885
then put me in the brig.

101
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,971
Otherwise, leave me alone.

102
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,982
( theme music playing )

103
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,837
CAPTAIN JANEWAY:<i> Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 48846.5.</i>

104
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,672
<i>Ordinarily,</i>
<i>the loss of a gel pack</i>

105
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,299
<i>would be a minor inconvenience,</i>

106
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,551
<i>but here in the Delta Quadrant,</i>
<i>it's a reminder</i>

107
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,095
<i>of the precarious nature</i>
<i>of our journey.</i>

108
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,680
I don't understand.

109
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,849
The gel packs have an extremely
reliable track record.

110
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,060
It's almost impossible
to damage them.

111
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,062
Why did this one
malfunction?

112
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,646
Unknown.

113
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,106
Lieutenant Torres
is running

114
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,774
a materials analysis
on the gel pack.

115
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,735
In the meantime,
the unit has been replaced.

116
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,695
How many do we have left
in reserve?

117
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:44,821
Forty-seven.

118
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,323
Those gel packs

119
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,325
run half the critical systems
on this ship.

120
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,744
Once they run out, that's it.

121
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,371
We can't replicate
new ones.

122
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,373
It might be possible
to switch over some systems

123
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:56,583
to conventional
isolinear circuits.

124
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,459
Good idea.
Start looking into it.

125
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,920
TUVOK: There is
one other matter

126
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,380
I wish to discuss.

127
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,673
I am concerned
about crewman Dalby.

128
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,717
He attempted to make
unauthorized repairs

129
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:06,968
on the damaged gel pack.

130
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,721
When I confronted him,
he lost control.

131
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,223
How so?

132
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:13,100
He became extremely angry,

133
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,103
to the point
of insubordination.

134
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,021
Dalby...

135
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,899
I've heard complaints
about him from others.

136
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,984
Indeed. This is not
the first incident

137
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,569
involving Mr. Dalby.

138
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,114
Last week, he was found
tampering with ship's systems

139
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,074
to increase a friend's
replicator rations,

140
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,201
and he has missed
three of his last ten

141
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,786
duty shifts.

142
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,663
Commander, you know Mr. Dalby
better than I do.

143
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,999
Any idea
what might be bothering him?

144
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,876
( sighs )

145
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,212
Dalby's always been
pretty aggressive.

146
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:45,340
My guess is the
man's frustrated.

147
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,008
He's not used to dealing

148
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,136
with Starfleet
protocol and procedure.

149
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,096
A starship cannot run
without protocols.

150
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,431
Mr. Dalby's attitude

151
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:55,142
is disrupting
this vessel's operations.

152
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,684
What do you suggest--

153
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,104
dragging him in front
of a disciplinary board?

154
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,481
Perhaps that would be
the best approach.

155
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,900
I doubt that's going to help.

156
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,988
Dalby's not the only Maquis
who's having problems adjusting.

157
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:12,451
And besides, it's not only
a matter of attitude.

158
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:14,619
It's also
a matter of experience.

159
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,704
It's not fair
to expect Starfleet behavior

160
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,957
from people
who never went to the Academy.

161
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:22,169
What do you propose?

162
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,879
We need to bring some
of these people up to speed.

163
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,841
Instruct them in how to run
a Starfleet vessel.

164
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:31,052
Show them why we do things
the way we do.

165
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,639
Give them an opportunity to feel
like they're part of the team.

166
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,976
A crash course in
Starfleet operations.

167
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,102
Field training.

168
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,646
Exactly.

169
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,065
So, what do you think,
Mr. Tuvok?

170
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,901
Are you up to training
a group of raw cadets?

171
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,236
Me?

172
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,072
You taught at the Academy
for 16 years.

173
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,074
You'd be perfect for the job.

174
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,994
Commander Chakotay
would be a more logical choice

175
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,078
to be their instructor.

176
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,206
He<i> is</i> a Maquis,
as well as

177
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,207
their former Captain.

178
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,000
That's my point.

179
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,751
He doesn't have
to earn their respect.

180
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,420
We do.

181
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,341
Very well, Captain.

182
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,092
I will prepare
a curriculum.

183
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,594
Commander, pick out
the Maquis crew members

184
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,014
you feel would benefit most
from the training.

185
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,391
Have them report

186
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,393
to Lieutenant Tuvok
at the next duty shift.

187
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,602
Right.

188
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,563
Don't worry, Tuvok.

189
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,773
I'll tell them
to take it easy on you.

190
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:33,407
...telling me that I'm
not supposed to be there...

191
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,658
Good morning.

192
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,244
We have assembled here

193
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,995
because Captain Janeway feels
you would all benefit

194
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,747
from additional
Starfleet training.

195
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:41,956
Consequently...

196
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,583
I think we need
some clarification.

197
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,751
Just why have<i> we</i>

198
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,878
been singled out
for this... honor?

199
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,171
The answer to that question

200
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,090
would seem to be self-evident,
crewman.

201
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,427
Interrupting a senior officer
is not acceptable behavior.

202
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,970
The purpose
of this training

203
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,931
is to familiarize you
with Starfleet protocols

204
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,892
so that mistakes like that
will be minimized.

205
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:03,144
Still, the fact
remains--

206
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,687
That is, uh,

207
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,232
if I may have permission
to speak, Lieutenant?

208
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,317
Thank you.

209
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,777
As I was saying,
the fact remains

210
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,487
that you must have
noticed certain problems

211
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,573
with each member
of this select group,

212
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,116
or we wouldn't be here.

213
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,118
I frankly can't imagine
what I might have done

214
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,536
that warrants
my inclusion.

215
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,995
Crewman Chell...
In fact...

216
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,997
your report indicates
that you are talkative,

217
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,166
disruptive and unreliable.

218
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,211
You promise to do tasks
which then go undone.

219
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:31,381
That is a complete
exaggeration.

220
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,800
Just yesterday, I overhauled
a servicing system...

221
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,510
Crewman, from this point on,

222
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,220
you will speak
only if you are spoken to.

223
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,805
But, Lieutenant,
I'm just trying...

224
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,975
40 laps
around the cargo bay.

225
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,935
Start running now.

226
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,520
But...
50 laps.

227
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,903
As I was saying,
this class

228
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,113
will adhere to standards

229
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,282
established
for Starfleet cadets.

230
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,033
There will be physical training

231
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,869
and academic studies
as well as tactical situations

232
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,205
which will be simulated
on the holodeck.

233
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,753
Crewman, have you
been listening to me?

234
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,591
Excuse me, I did not
hear that answer.

235
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,176
Yes.

236
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,969
Speak up, crewman.

237
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:20,972
I said yes.

238
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,681
From now on,
you will look at me

239
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:23,724
when I am talking
to you.

240
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,059
Leave him alone.

241
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,102
What was that?

242
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,396
I said leave him alone.

243
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,981
Can't you see
he's just a kid?

244
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,732
He shouldn't
even be here.

245
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,067
We think he should.

246
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,528
You'll probably have me

247
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,904
running 200 laps for this,
but I don't care.

248
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,615
The problem we're having,
Lieutenant,

249
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,325
is that this whole thing
is insulting.

250
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,202
We didn't ask
to come aboard this ship,

251
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,078
but we understand
the situation we're in,

252
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,955
and we've done
the best job we can,

253
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,208
and now you're telling us
that's not good enough.

254
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,376
That is correct.

255
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,461
Well, maybe
that's too bad.

256
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,630
Maybe we've done
the best that we can,

257
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,340
and that's as good
as you're going to get.

258
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,550
How about it?

259
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,510
Does anybody really
want to be here?

260
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,387
I don't have anything
to learn from him.

261
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:03,056
Well, I don't think
he's going to phaser us,

262
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,142
and frankly, I'd rather
be in the brig than in here,

263
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,768
so let's go.

264
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,689
Crewman,

265
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,857
you are demonstrating
rank insubordination.

266
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,026
I order all of you
to stay where you are.

267
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,944
Chell!

268
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,155
DALBY:
Come on.

269
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,408
We're leaving.

270
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:35,754
I don't know.

271
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,507
Maybe it wasn't
such a good idea

272
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:38,883
to leave like that.

273
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,427
I mean, they're not
just going to let us

274
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,844
get away with it.

275
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,138
What are they going to do,
put us off the ship?

276
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,806
Keep us in the brig
for 70 years?

277
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,434
Every person on this ship
is needed.

278
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,227
Nothing's going
to happen.

279
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:50,811
It's not like we're
guilty of mutiny.

280
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,313
We'll just keep
doing our jobs,

281
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,565
same as ever.

282
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,277
( quietly ):
We're just not
going to jump

283
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,571
through any
Starfleet hoops.

284
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,709
You want to give me
your version of what happened?

285
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,127
Commander, we're
going to live up

286
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,629
to our responsibilities
on this ship.

287
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,380
We're just not
going to be treated

288
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,257
like teenage cadets.

289
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,341
I see.

290
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,218
It was ridiculous.

291
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,762
Tuvok had Chell
running laps

292
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:24,845
around the cargo bay.

293
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,056
And he was
picking on Gerron.

294
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,933
I don't like it.

295
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,644
Really?

296
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:31,728
Look, Commander,

297
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,187
you know as
well as I do

298
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,355
that we're used
to playing

299
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,607
with a different
rule book.

300
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,776
There's
the Starfleet way,

301
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,111
and there's
the Maquis way.

302
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,530
And you want to do things
the Maquis way?

303
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,822
That's right.

304
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:46,284
That's always
worked for us.

305
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,379
That's the Maquis way,
too, isn't it?

306
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,381
And if you want to keep
doing it the Maquis way,

307
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,800
that's fine with me.

308
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,177
We can do that tomorrow,
the next day,

309
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,430
every day until you report
to Lieutenant Tuvok.

310
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,225
You understand me? What?

311
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,687
How does a Starfleet crewman
answer a question?

312
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:16,897
Yes... sir.

313
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,571
Does anybody else
have a problem?

314
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,513
These are your study assignments
for next week.

315
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:51,182
Please note that examinations
will be conducted randomly

316
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:53,309
with no advance notice.

317
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,396
I will now inspect
your uniforms.

318
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,398
Crewman Henley,

319
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,316
your head band
is certainly festive...

320
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,735
Thank you.

321
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,153
However, it is in violation
of regulations.

322
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,822
Please check
the protocol files

323
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,324
for recommended guidelines.

324
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,037
What is this?

325
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,249
It's a, uh...
Kazleti design.

326
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,501
I studied the technique
when I visited their planet.

327
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,836
It took me weeks to learn.

328
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,671
I know it doesn't
look complicated, but...

329
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:24,048
This ornament
is in violation
of the dress code.

330
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,842
It was hidden.
You could hardly see it.

331
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:29,136
You will remove it now.

332
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:36,269
I know-- I'll have
to take off the earring.

333
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,562
Correct.

334
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,022
In addition, your
boots are scuffed.

335
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,483
From now on, you will
arrive in polished boots.

336
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,694
Yes, sir.

337
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,907
Do you have a
problem, Mr. Dalby?

338
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,617
No, sir.

339
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,243
Very well.

340
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:55,329
You will all report to me
on Deck 11 at 1900 hours.

341
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,581
Dismissed.

342
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,374
HENLEY:
What are we going
to be doing?

343
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,461
You will find that out
at 1900 hours.

344
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,837
Dismissed.

345
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,765
I'm going through
with this field training...

346
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,683
<i>as ordered,</i>

347
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,518
but I can't say
it's very productive.

348
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,353
Frankly, it feels
like punishment.

349
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,688
In other words,

350
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,148
you're afraid
you won't make it,

351
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,733
that you'll fail
this training.

352
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,318
Excuse me?

353
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,946
That's not what I said
or what I'm thinking.

354
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,324
What?

355
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,242
You think I can't make it

356
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,495
through this
ridiculous exercise?

357
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,746
That's absurd.

358
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,332
Fine, then
make it through.

359
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,667
( alarm blares )

360
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,294
TORRES:
It's another
power failure.

361
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,338
It's the gel packs again.

362
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,589
Deck 4, Section 9-C.

363
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,299
JANEWAY:<i> Bridge to Engineering.</i>
<i>Report.</i>

364
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,177
It's another malfunction
in the bio-neural circuitry.

365
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,804
We're putting a repair
crew on it now.

366
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,013
Torres out.

367
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,389
Dalby, replace the
failed gel pack

368
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,224
and check out the
adjoining circuits.

369
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,601
Make sure we don't have

370
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,478
some kind of cascade
feedback causing this.

371
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,689
We can't just keep
replacing these things.

372
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,316
Ensign, you're in charge
till I get back.

373
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,401
I'll be in Sick Bay
if you need me.

374
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,446
KES:
What is it?

375
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,865
It's your new patient.

376
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,491
It's one of the
bio-neural

377
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:14,701
gel packs.

378
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,410
Ah, yes...

379
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,289
I'm aware of these devices,
but I've never seen one.

380
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,875
It's malfunctioning,

381
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,584
but I can't find
anything wrong with
it mechanically.

382
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,919
I thought that
you could look

383
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,504
at the biological
component.

384
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,589
Interesting.

385
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,552
Initiate the scan.

386
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:36,096
Scanning beam is active.

387
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,974
Ah-ha.

388
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,475
TORRES:
What?

389
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,352
The patient is sick.

390
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,480
Can you be
more specific?

391
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,982
To discuss
the patient's condition

392
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,525
in front of the patient

393
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,443
would be a serious breach
of professional etiquette.

394
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,779
It's been suggested
that I cultivate

395
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,366
a greater sensitivity
to my patients' needs.

396
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,076
Don't worry, my little friend.

397
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,369
Doctor...

398
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,496
Very well.

399
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,374
The biological component
of the circuit device

400
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:06,293
has an infection--
a very contagious one.

401
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,046
Is the crew
in any danger?

402
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:11,090
I don't detect any sign of
infection in you, Lieutenant.

403
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,426
I suspect the contagion
is not harmful to humanoids.

404
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,135
If it were, we probably would
have seen evidence of illness

405
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,846
in the crew by now.

406
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,681
But in order to protect
the ship's circuitry,

407
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,182
you'll have to isolate
and quarantine

408
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,684
all the affected gel packs

409
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,477
until a treatment regimen
can be initiated.

410
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,605
I'll have to take
the forward grids off-line.

411
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:26,981
We'll lose replicators,

412
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,357
but I can reroute
primary systems.

413
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,609
How long do you need?

414
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,235
I don't know.

415
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,779
Unless we find the source
of the infection,

416
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,321
we won't be able to stop it
from spreading.

417
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,366
Okay, I'll tell
the captain.

418
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,368
We'll be taking
a ten-kilometer run.

419
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,328
I've cleared Deck 13
of personnel for the evening.

420
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:44,415
Make sure your packs are secure
to avoid chafing.

421
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:45,416
Couldn't I just carry Henley?

422
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,334
She weighs
about the same.

423
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,169
( laughter )

424
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,548
We will get to Deck 13

425
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,801
by using
the Jefferies tubes.

426
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:58,096
Well, at least it's
only two decks down.

427
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,223
Not that way, crewman.

428
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,102
We are getting to Deck 13
by way of the mess hall.

429
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,770
That's on Deck 2.

430
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,563
We'd have to crawl through
over 50 Jefferies tubes

431
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,648
to get there.

432
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,357
Correct. I'm glad to see

433
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,735
your knowledge of the ship's
internal structure is improving.

434
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,696
Crewman Gerron--
lead the way.

435
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,741
( panting )

436
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,578
CHELL:
Thank you.

437
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,288
You can stay there
as long as you like,

438
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,041
as far as I'm concerned.

439
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,333
This pack feels like

440
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,377
it's filled
with latinum bricks.

441
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,586
TUVOK:
Crewman Gerron,

442
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,254
what is the
problem up there?

443
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,631
Keep going.

444
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:19,177
Maybe he'll slip
and plunge to his death.

445
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:22,180
( panting )

446
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,230
Be my guest.

447
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,910
( panting )

448
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,800
TUVOK: All right,
the ten kilometers begin now.

449
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,385
HENLEY:
My legs feel like lead pipes.

450
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,553
DALBY:
Don't think about it.

451
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:03,888
Keep your mind
on something else.

452
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,389
How about the pain
in my shoulders?

453
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,705
That was a run

454
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,624
of approximately
10.1 kilometers.

455
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,584
That wasn't a run,
it was a death march.

456
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,335
You may be
experiencing difficulty

457
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,797
because I increased the gravity
on this deck by ten percent.

458
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,048
What?!

459
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,008
( sighs )

460
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,469
You never know what conditions
you might encounter.

461
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:44,470
You must be prepared

462
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,139
for anything.

463
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:49,558
Crewman Gerron and Chell,
you have not completed your run.

464
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,895
By my account, we have
lapped you three times.

465
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,606
You will finish
the ten kilometers now.

466
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,657
We will repeat
this exercise
tomorrow evening,

467
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,242
and I will expect
each one of you

468
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,410
to better
your performance.

469
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:18,254
( electronic humming )

470
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,551
Have you found any traces
of the bacteria?

471
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,095
I've checked
the transporter logs

472
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,096
for the past month.

473
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,514
There's no indication

474
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,099
that the bio-filter
picked up anything suspicious.

475
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,642
We stopped at that
planet, Napinne,

476
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:34,145
brought on some food
stores for Neelix.

477
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:35,980
Some of it looked
pretty strange.

478
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,023
KIM:
Right.

479
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:38,356
Varmeliate fiber,

480
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,151
whole green<i> putillos</i>
and schplict.

481
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:41,359
Schplict?

482
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,862
<i>Grakel</i> milk.

483
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,114
I've looked at the logs.
Everything checked out.

484
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:47,574
Okay, let's go over the
environmental systems.

485
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:50,452
Maybe we're dealing
with something airborne.

486
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,954
( electronic humming continues )

487
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:54,623
He's been at it
since before I got here.

488
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,708
Chell...

489
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,752
What are you doing?

490
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,462
Mr. Tuvok ordered me

491
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:03,216
to degauss
the entire transporter room.

492
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,968
But you're using
a micro resonator.

493
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,094
I know.

494
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,221
TORRES:
Why don't you use

495
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,347
the magneton scanner?

496
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:10,973
You'd be done
in five minutes.

497
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,100
Tuvok told him to use
the micro resonator.

498
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,476
But he'll be at
it for hours.

499
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:19,815
Mr. Tuvok estimated 26.3 hours.

500
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,193
Sounds like
a Tuvok estimate.

501
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:24,153
Well...

502
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,988
good luck.

503
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:30,326
Oh, you missed a spot.

504
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,832
TUVOK:
<i>Security Log, supplemental.</i>

505
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,543
<i>I have recreated the Bridge</i>
<i>of</i> Voyager<i> on the holodeck</i>

506
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,129
<i>and scheduled</i>
<i>a war-game simulation.</i>

507
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,298
<i>I am hopeful</i>
<i>that an exercise in teamwork</i>

508
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:46,424
<i>will help to instill</i>
<i>a sense of participation</i>

509
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:48,177
<i>among my trainees.</i>

510
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:51,222
On the Bridge, we depend
on the smooth functioning

511
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:53,349
of every crewman
at every station.

512
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:55,684
You are the captain's
eyes, ears and hands.

513
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:59,605
You must function
as one perfectly tuned unit.

514
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:02,691
Mr. Dalby, I understand
you have command experience.

515
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,526
Yes, sir.

516
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,652
You have the Bridge.

517
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:06,862
The program
will present you

518
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,197
with a series
of random events

519
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:10,324
which you and your crew
must deal with

520
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:12,285
in whatever manner
you see fit.

521
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:13,660
I understand.

522
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,870
The program will
be initiated

523
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,538
when you set a course.

524
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:19,083
All set?

525
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,376
Ready.
Aye, sir.

526
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:23,254
Mr. Chell,
ahead warp six,

527
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:25,714
heading 159 mark 7.

528
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:26,840
Aye, sir.

529
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,008
Mr. Gerron,

530
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,260
what's the nearest
star system?

531
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,053
I'm showing a red giant system

532
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,846
3.7 light-years
from our current position.

533
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,307
There are
eight planets,

534
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:35,975
none of them
M-Class.

535
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,810
Sir, we're picking up
an automated distress call.

536
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,312
Source?

537
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:41,230
Unknown. There's a lot
of subspace interference.

538
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,107
Gerron, can
you get a fix?

539
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:46,444
Sensors indicate a Ferengi ship,
heavily damaged by weapons fire.

540
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,446
Eight life-form readings,
very faint.

541
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:50,364
Hail them.

542
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,325
They're not responding.

543
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:53,951
I must point out, sir,

544
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:56,329
that the Ferengi have been known
to deceive other ships

545
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:57,913
by pretending to be damaged.

546
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,581
We could be falling
into a trap.

547
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,584
We have a duty to
offer humanitarian aid

548
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,836
if we can.

549
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,338
Chell, change course

550
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:07,256
to intercept.

551
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,715
Course laid in, sir.

552
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,426
Proceed.

553
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,678
Sir, a Romulan warbird
de-cloaking off the port bow.

554
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:13,971
Red Alert.

555
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:15,181
( alarm blaring )

556
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:16,432
DALBY: Hail them--
let them know

557
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:17,975
we're on a
rescue mission.

558
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,435
They're powering up
weapons.

559
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:20,936
No response to the hail.

560
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,562
Evasive maneuvers, Mr. Chell.

561
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,815
Initiating evasive sequence,
Beta 9-3.

562
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,611
We've been hit on the
lateral phaser array.

563
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,737
Shields at 81 percent.

564
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,239
Arm all forward phasers.

565
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,907
Sir, there's a second
Romulan ship de-cloaking,

566
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,242
dead ahead.

567
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,827
It's launching
torpedoes.

568
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:39,913
GERRON:
Damage to Decks

569
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,874
11 through 15,
reports of casualties.

570
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,792
Arm all photon banks.
Mr. Chell,

571
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,044
continue use
of evasive action.

572
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,505
Henley, fire at will.
Aye, sir.

573
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:50,383
Shields are buckling.

574
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:52,009
Hull breach on Deck 9.

575
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,302
Keep firing, Henley.

576
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,221
Let's do as much damage
as we can.

577
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:58,015
( alarm blaring )

578
00:25:58,015 --> 00:26:00,558
Computer, reset program.

579
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,357
TUVOK:
Your first
command together

580
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:08,484
was less than
successful.

581
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,236
You are all dead.

582
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:12,779
It was a no-win situation.

583
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,408
What were we supposed to do?

584
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,284
Can anyone answer that question?

585
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,999
I thought we went by the book.

586
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:27,878
I certainly did everything
I could possibly do.

587
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:29,587
My evasive
action sequences

588
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,673
cannot be faulted.

589
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,842
At least we went out
with our phasers firing.

590
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,594
Mr. Gerron,

591
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:39,723
do you have
something to add?

592
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,350
What does it matter?

593
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:44,103
It matters because if you do not
learn from your mistakes,

594
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,105
you will be doomed
to repeat them.

595
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,356
I was in command.

596
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:48,982
Put the blame on me.

597
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,318
The crew was just
following my orders.

598
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,986
And have you
reached a conclusion

599
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,196
as to your error?

600
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:55,822
I thought I did
everything I could.

601
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,200
We were just outgunned.

602
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,659
I see.

603
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,788
Did the possibility of retreat
not occur to you?

604
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,248
Retreat?

605
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:06,208
I can't believe
you'd say that.

606
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,127
The strongest tactical move
is always the one

607
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,170
in which you will reap
the highest gain

608
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,131
at the lowest cost.

609
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:15,008
Going out with phasers firing
may seem heroic,

610
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:18,471
but in the long run,
it is merely foolish.

611
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:21,432
Retreat is often
the best possible option.

612
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:23,476
Well, Mr. Tuvok,

613
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:26,270
once more,
you've proven your point.

614
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:30,316
We're just not
Starfleet material.

615
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:35,028
Are we dismissed...

616
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,405
sir?

617
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,949
Dismissed.

618
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:41,368
Computer, exit.

619
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:12,107
I feel that my services
as morale officer are required.

620
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,485
I assure you,
you are wrong.

621
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,320
Oh, really? Huh.

622
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,197
Well, one--
no cup of tea.

623
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,407
Two-- no padd.

624
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,076
Three-- you're sitting
on the opposite side

625
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,662
from usual.

626
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:26,038
All of that tells me

627
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:28,832
you've got something
on your mind.

628
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,293
And what tells me that
it's making you miserable

629
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,420
is that cloud of doom

630
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:37,257
that's rising from you
like a ground fog.

631
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,425
I cannot imagine

632
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,135
that there are
visible emanations

633
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,346
which allow you
to interpret my mood.

634
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,223
You are making
wild assumptions.

635
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:47,851
Uh-huh. Maquis trainees
getting you down?

636
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:51,689
I do not believe

637
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:53,815
they are responding
well to my instruction.

638
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,195
What seems
to be the problem?

639
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:01,574
That is what I've been
trying to determine,

640
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:05,160
and I'm afraid
I am at a loss.

641
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,996
I have taught literally
thousands of cadets,

642
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:11,083
and I have never encountered
these difficulties.

643
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:14,253
My methods are sound
and time-honored.

644
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:17,339
I insist on strict adherence
to rules and protocols

645
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,550
and never waver
from that approach.

646
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,885
I have always
been successful

647
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:25,305
in honing each cadet
into a Starfleet officer.

648
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,686
Come with me.

649
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:32,312
I want to show you something.

650
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:38,193
These are Keela flowers.

651
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:42,072
They're beautiful
and remarkably strong.

652
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,283
The stem is flexible.

653
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,201
It's impossible to break.

654
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,870
But occasionally,
on the same plant,

655
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:53,125
there's a bloom whose
stem is not so flexible.

656
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,293
Ah, here's one, see?

657
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:57,129
And when the stem
is brittle...

658
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,880
it breaks.

659
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,299
You're saying that
the Maquis crew

660
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,259
is rigid and inflexible,

661
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:05,887
that they will never
adjust to Starfleet rules.

662
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,514
No, Mr. Vulcan.

663
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:10,601
I'm saying that<i> you</i> are
rigid and inflexible.

664
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:13,771
But maybe if you learn
to bend a little,

665
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:16,732
you might have better
luck with your class.

666
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,817
Those Maquis aren't
Starfleet cadets.

667
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,902
You can't treat them
the same way.

668
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,362
Get to know them, eh?

669
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:25,699
Try to find out
what they're like inside.

670
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:29,035
You might discover
a better teaching method.

671
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,330
I am not sure if
I have the ability

672
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,416
to find out what
they're like inside.

673
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:38,086
Mr. Neelix, what is that?

674
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,130
( inhaling )

675
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,757
Ooh! Brill cheese.

676
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44,384
I made it from that schplict
we brought on board last week.

677
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,928
Uh, Ensign Ashmore asked

678
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,348
for something called
macaroni and cheese.

679
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:50,724
Cheese.

680
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:54,353
You must cultivate
bacteria to make cheese.

681
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,396
Of course.

682
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:16,792
CAPTAIN JANEWAY:<i> Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 48859.3.</i>

683
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,210
<i>Lieutenant Tuvok has reported</i>

684
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,295
<i>what may be</i>
<i>a possible explanation</i>

685
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,423
<i>for the infection</i>
<i>in the bio-neural gel packs.</i>

686
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,884
<i>I have asked Lieutenant Torres</i>
<i>and her team</i>

687
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,969
<i>to investigate</i>
<i>Neelix's kitchen.</i>

688
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,513
Get me a schematic
of the airflow patterns

689
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:30,389
for the whole ship.

690
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,307
MAN:
Aye, sir.

691
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,477
The cheese is full
of volatile bacterial spores.

692
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:39,314
It has to stay isolated in this
portable containment field.

693
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,733
WOMAN:
What is this?

694
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:42,484
NEELIX:
That's just a Laurelian pudding.

695
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,528
It has to simmer
for four hours.

696
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:47,322
TORRES:
The spores must have traveled

697
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,574
through that intake

698
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:51,034
and then into
the ventilation system.

699
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,578
Where they were disseminated
throughout the ship,

700
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:55,539
subsequently infecting
the bio-neural circuitry.

701
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:57,708
I feel awful about this.

702
00:31:57,708 --> 00:32:00,669
I assure you,
I had no idea.

703
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:03,630
More gel packs must be down.

704
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,465
If this is getting to
the environmental systems,

705
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,926
we may be in more trouble
than we thought.

706
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:11,054
Neelix,
this wasn't your fault.

707
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,932
The important thing
is that we found the source.

708
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,809
Get the cheese to Sick Bay.

709
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:18,144
The doctor should look at it
as soon as possible.

710
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,813
Yes, Lieutenant.

711
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,986
You may break, Mr. Dalby.

712
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:31,658
Okay.

713
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,255
Do you play pool often?

714
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:46,381
Not really.

715
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:49,175
I did when I was younger.

716
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,267
Do you have a family?

717
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:59,478
What is this all about?

718
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:00,604
Pardon?

719
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,355
This little exercise.

720
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,608
Are we testing
my social skills?

721
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:07,569
Does Starfleet have rules
about them, too?

722
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:10,989
I had thought we could
get to know each other.

723
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,908
Perhaps then
our relationship

724
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:15,243
would function
more smoothly.

725
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,995
Get to know each other?

726
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,540
Okay...

727
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:24,002
here's the brief history
of Kenneth Dalby.

728
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,755
We lived
on the Bajoran frontier.

729
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,548
It was a hard life.

730
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,510
I coped by getting
into a lot of trouble.

731
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:35,555
I was angry
at everybody and everything

732
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:39,434
until a woman came along
who taught me about love,

733
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:43,605
and for a while,
I wasn't angry anymore.

734
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:51,571
Three Cardassians raped her
and smashed her skull.

735
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,156
I joined the Maquis

736
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:56,994
and tried to slaughter
as many of them as I could find.

737
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:58,620
How about you?

738
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,705
Any family?

739
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:04,543
I do, but there is nothing
to report about them

740
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,920
that would compare
with your story.

741
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,422
I have observed

742
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,590
that you seem
to be somewhat

743
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,967
protective of Mr. Gerron.

744
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:14,594
Have you formed
a friendship with him?

745
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:17,014
No.

746
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:19,808
He won't let me get close.

747
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:22,060
First time I saw him,

748
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,813
I thought I was looking
at myself at that age.

749
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:26,606
I thought maybe
I could be a friend.

750
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,692
Maybe he wouldn't turn out
the way I did.

751
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:32,487
But I didn't
have much luck.

752
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,782
Then we got stuck out here.

753
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:39,494
Being so far away from home
is hard on somebody that young.

754
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,079
So I'd appreciate it

755
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,040
if you'd try not to make him
any more miserable

756
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,624
than he is already.

757
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,836
Commander Chakotay specifically
recommended Mr. Gerron

758
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,588
for this program.

759
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:52,883
He felt that if the young man
were able to learn new skills,

760
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:55,052
to set goals
and accomplish them,

761
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:56,511
it might go a long way

762
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:59,598
toward making him feel better
about himself.

763
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,182
That's why he's in this group?

764
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:04,477
It is our intention that
the experience be positive

765
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,187
for everyone.

766
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:09,441
If you say so.

767
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,777
But understand
this, Lieutenant.

768
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,323
I don't want to
get to know you,

769
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:20,702
and I don't want
to be your friend.

770
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,753
This is the most
pernicious infective agent

771
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:31,088
I've ever seen.

772
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:33,423
It's systematically
attacked every cell

773
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:35,508
in the gel pack's
biological matrix.

774
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,510
I've exposed it to every
anti-bacterial agent

775
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,553
we have available.

776
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,471
It hasn't responded.

777
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,639
( dull thud )

778
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,390
( engines whine )

779
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,102
Sick Bay to Bridge.
Captain, what seems
to be happening?

780
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:47,186
JANEWAY:<i> We're losing more</i>
<i>bio-neural circuitry, Doctor.</i>

781
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:49,106
All systems are being affected.

782
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:51,775
Please, tell me you have some
good news about a treatment.

783
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:54,319
DOCTOR:<i> I'm afraid not.</i>
<i>Frankly, I'm at a loss.</i>

784
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,612
But we'll keep trying.

785
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,739
<i>Please do. Janeway out.</i>

786
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:59,658
What I find curious

787
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,660
is that these bacteria
didn't show up

788
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,121
in any of our diagnostic scans
of the ship.

789
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:07,124
But if the bacteria
didn't spread from the cheese

790
00:36:07,124 --> 00:36:09,501
into the ship's systems,

791
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:12,211
how did the gel packs
get infected?

792
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:16,049
Haven't I read that viruses
can live inside bacteria?

793
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:18,885
Of course... a virus.

794
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,013
The bacteria could be hosts
to the infectious virus.

795
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:22,722
There are thousands
of viruses so small

796
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,141
they would have
escaped detection.

797
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:26,392
So maybe we should try
the anti-viral agents

798
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,435
on the gel packs.

799
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,312
It's certainly worth a try.

800
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,939
( dull thud )

801
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:33,066
I think the inertial dampeners
are malfunctioning.

802
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:34,651
Along with a lot
of other things.

803
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:38,697
Class dismissed. Return to
your duty stations.

804
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:39,739
( buzzer hums )

805
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,533
Lieutenant?

806
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,409
( electrical crackling )

807
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:51,751
We're stuck in here.

808
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,712
Captain, the bio-neural network
is failing sequentially.

809
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:56,631
We're losing systems faster than
we can compensate with backups.

810
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,300
What about changing over
to isolinear circuitry?

811
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,844
Torres is working on it,

812
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,637
but it's a long way
from being ready.

813
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,389
It couldn't even maintain
life support at this point.

814
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,099
Propulsion is down.

815
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:07,976
Every system
on the main grid is down--

816
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:11,270
communication, transporters,
turbolifts, and life support.

817
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,605
Bridge to Engineering.

818
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,273
<i>Torres here, Captain.</i>

819
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,735
Transfer whatever power you can
to life support

820
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:19,362
and keep working on
the isolinear circuitry.

821
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,655
<i>Understood.</i>

822
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,824
( beeping and buzzing )

823
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:28,038
The manual override
isn't working, sir.

824
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:30,207
Can't get the main
cargo door open either.

825
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:32,291
Tuvok to Bridge.

826
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,626
This is
Lieutenant Tuvok.

827
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:37,089
Is anyone receiving
this message?

828
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:39,382
It appears our duty stations
will have to do without us

829
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,342
for the time being.

830
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,600
Captain,
life support is failing.

831
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,351
Deck 15 has lost all power,

832
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,270
and Deck 7 has lost
its gravitational grid.

833
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,730
DOCTOR:
<i>Sick Bay to Bridge.</i>

834
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,607
<i>Captain, I believe</i>
<i>we may have something.</i>

835
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,109
Go ahead, Doctor.

836
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:59,277
<i>The gel packs are incapable</i>
<i>of responding</i>

837
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,197
to an infection in the same way
that humanoid organisms do.

838
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:05,408
With a fever.
<i>Exactly.</i>

839
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,244
We've experimented
with heating the samples

840
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:08,787
of bio-neural circuitry
we have here,

841
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,163
and the results are promising.

842
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:11,623
Of course,
we don't have the ability

843
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,332
to produce
the amount of heat needed

844
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,001
<i>to wipe out</i>
<i>a shipwide infection.</i>

845
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,586
Janeway to Torres.

846
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,337
<i>Torres here.</i>

847
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,715
If we wanted to superheat
the gel pack system--

848
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,550
to raise its temperature,
so to speak--

849
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,136
how could we do it?

850
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:26,387
<i>I suppose we could infuse</i>
<i>the gel pack circuits</i>

851
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:29,515
with a high-energy plasma burst
from a symmetric warp field.

852
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,059
But we'd have to generate
that heat

853
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:33,145
by inverting the warp field
toward the ship.

854
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:36,314
Right. We could produce
the required energy by getting

855
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,108
the warp engines
to 80 percent of maximum

856
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:39,609
while we're standing still.

857
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:41,527
<i>Then we could initiate</i>
<i>the plasma burst.</i>

858
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:42,779
Can we get to 80 percent

859
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,489
with all the control
failures we have?

860
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:47,533
If we reroute the emergency
power to the warp engines,

861
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:50,036
it might be enough,
but it's a risky move.

862
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:54,582
I'm aware of that,
but I think we have to try it.

863
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,043
Divert all power,
including life support,

864
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,419
to the warp engines.

865
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,545
<i>Aye, Captain.</i>

866
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,839
Mr. Paris,

867
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,549
deactivate the nacelle
control system

868
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,802
and prepare to engage
the warp engines.

869
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,639
Nacelle controls deactivated.

870
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,474
Ready to go.

871
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,892
Do it.

872
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:16,229
( rumbling )

873
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:19,941
( clanking and whirring )

874
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,818
What's that noise?

875
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:27,657
Ah. This conduit's getting
very hot.

876
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:28,950
So am I.

877
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,077
It's getting
awfully warm in here.

878
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,746
Something's wrong,
very wrong.

879
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,748
CHELL:
I don't like
this at all.

880
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,834
I would surmise that the Captain
is making some effort

881
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,460
to deal
with the systems' failures.

882
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,005
The fact that we do not know
what that effort entails

883
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:43,715
may lead us
to imagine the worst.

884
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,675
We must not let fear
get the best of us.

885
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:46,926
( deep rumbling )

886
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:52,265
Mr. Gerron, it is possible
the console in the control room

887
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:53,808
is still functioning.

888
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,269
Please see if you can open
the doors from there.

889
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,188
Yes, sir.

890
00:39:58,188 --> 00:39:59,231
TUVOK:
In the meantime,

891
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:00,357
we can attempt
to access

892
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:01,482
one of the Jefferies tubes

893
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,817
through
the forward bulkhead.

894
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,488
I don't know about the bacteria,

895
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,074
but I'm about ready
to pass out.

896
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:11,326
Engines are only at 74 percent
of maximum.

897
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,745
That's not enough
for a plasma burst.

898
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:16,122
Mr. Paris,
increase antimatter flow.

899
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,920
It's having an effect, Captain.
Temperature is at 340 kelvins.

900
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,963
Can we get the engines
a little hotter?

901
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:28,218
Mr. Paris, get us to
80 percent of maximum somehow.

902
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:30,011
I'll try.

903
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:33,681
Okay, we're at
360 kelvins.

904
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,767
Engines are at
79 percent of maximum.

905
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,185
I think we can risk it.

906
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:39,687
Bridge to Torres.
Initiate the plasma burst.

907
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,273
<i>Aye, Captain,</i>
<i>but be prepared.</i>

908
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:42,774
<i>It might blow out</i>
<i>some of the conduits.</i>

909
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,068
Acknowledged. Go ahead.

910
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:51,241
( explosion, gas hissing )

911
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:53,243
TUVOK: The plasma gas
will become toxic
within minutes.

912
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:55,287
We must leave immediately.

913
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:56,579
What about Gerron?

914
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,876
We can't leave him!

915
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,128
Get in the Jefferies tube.

916
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:04,796
I cannot risk
losing any more of you

917
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,047
to save one man.

918
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:07,757
What is that,
some kind of Starfleet rule?

919
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,134
It is always tactically correct

920
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:11,010
to sacrifice the few
for the many.

921
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,804
I don't give a Circassian fig
what's tactically correct.

922
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,222
I'm going back for him.

923
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:17,142
This is one time when retreat
is not an option!

924
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:18,601
( coughing )

925
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:19,936
Get in the
Jefferies tube<i> now.</i>

926
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:22,147
( coughing )

927
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:23,773
Mr. Dalby, I will
break your arm

928
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:25,483
if you do not
follow my order.

929
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,859
I won't forget this.

930
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,903
You're letting him die.

931
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,363
Keep moving.

932
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,168
Janeway to Sick Bay.
Report.

933
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:46,045
DOCTOR:<i> Bacterial levels</i>
<i>are dropping, Captain.</i>

934
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,839
If they continue,
we should be able

935
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,257
to purge the system
within a few minutes.

936
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,508
JANEWAY:
<i>Keep me informed.</i>

937
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,718
We need life support
back on line

938
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,220
as soon as possible.

939
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,015
<i>I'll get back to you</i>
<i>right away, Captain.</i>

940
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,352
( coughing )

941
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:44,645
DOCTOR:
<i>Sick Bay to Bridge.</i>

942
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,857
<i>Repeat, Sick Bay to Bridge.</i>
<i>Can anyone hear me?</i>

943
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:49,484
Come in, Doctor.

944
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:51,777
<i>All of the infectious bacteria</i>
<i>have been destroyed.</i>

945
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:54,489
The danger of further infection
has passed.

946
00:42:57,033 --> 00:43:03,540
Mr. Kim... start getting
our systems back on line.

947
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,124
Aye, Captain.

948
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,961
( grunting )

949
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:24,060
( coughing )

950
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,398
Come on, come on!

951
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,585
I think he's all right.

952
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,963
I thought Starfleet rules

953
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,881
said that was
an unacceptable risk,

954
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,092
going back to save him.

955
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:58,052
It was.

956
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:01,473
However, I recently realized
that there are times

957
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:05,226
when it is desirable
to bend the rules.

958
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:08,980
Lieutenant, if you can learn
to<i> bend</i> the rules,

959
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,690
I guess we can learn
to<i> follow</i> them.

960
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:17,405
Come on. Let's get you two
to Sick Bay.

961
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:44,974
(<i> theme playing</i> )
