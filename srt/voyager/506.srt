The glacial fractures
are stable.

frozen solid.

12
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:36,401
Decks 9 through 14
are now Deck 10.

13
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,778
They've been compacted.

14

the ice at full impulse.

The EMH?

access Sick Bay.

17
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,369
The relays
aren't responding.

18
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,829
I'm losing
the interface.

19
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,872

Let's get moving.

23
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,381
Keep an open com-link.

24
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,726
Chakotay to Tessa.

25
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:33,768

27
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,772

<i>Stand by.</i>

29
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,025
Make it quick.

30
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:43,904
This isn't exactly
a happy reunion.

31
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,572
I've got a lock.

32
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,997

00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,082
Long time no see.

00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,041
Ensign.

35
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,334
I go by Harry now.

36
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,501
It's a long story.

37
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,003
Where's your
mobile emitter?

38
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,047
What's happened
to the ship? The crew?

39
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,298
No time. The emitter.

40
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,423
It's in here, but...

41
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,136
Here.

42
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,263
Slap it on and let's go.

43
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,639
Wait. I demand
an explanation.

44
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,309
I'll give you one.

45
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:17,020
We're here to
change history.

Ladies and gentlemen,

00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,018
please...

49
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,437
may I introduce

50
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:02,357
the next generation
of instellar propulsion--

51
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:06,153
the quantum slipstream drive.

52
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,242
Four years,
two months, 11 days--

53
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,202
that's precisely how long

54
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,830
<i>Voyager's</i> been
in the Delta Quadrant.

55
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,373
And during that time,

56
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:21,418
we've advanced
the frontiers of exploration

57
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,711
and, more importantly,
we've survived.

58
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,505
FEMALE:
Hear, hear.

59
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,132
Now it's time to go home.

60
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,842
(<i> cheering</i> )

61
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,303
Enjoy the celebration,
but keep in mind,

62
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,805
we've still got a lot of work
to do before tomorrow's flight.

63
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,765
Go easy on that champagne,
Lieutenant.

64
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,392
(<i> chuckling</i> )

65
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,559
Quantum matrix...

66
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,354
Benamite crystals...
Borg technology...

67
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,397
Can you imagine what
Starfleet is going to say?

68
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,107
I don't think we'll
hear any complaints.

69
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,026
The Federation's first
slipstream drive--

70
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,695
they'll probably nominate us
for the Cochrane Medal of Honor.

71
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,613
I'll start working
on my acceptance speech.

72
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,532
"I'd like to thank
the Borg collective..."

73
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,825
Dinner plans?

74
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,660
Nothing special.
Date with a replicator.

75
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,911
Cancel it.
That's an order.

76
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,831
Aye, Captain.

77
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:00,832
Lieutenant?

78
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:01,916
Lieutenant.

79
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,793
Excuse me.

80
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:07,255
My contribution
to the slipstream drive.

81
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,132
Thanks.
What is it?

82
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,885
A Talaxian furfly.

83
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,263
An old spacefaring tradition
among my people.

84
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,724
If one of these creatures
stowed away on your ship,

85
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,310
it was a sign
of good fortune.

86
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,396
I had this little fellow
preserved.

87
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:25,106
He hung in my engine room
for six years.

88
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,235
Cute.

89
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:31,488
Mr. Neelix, you are an unending
source of astonishment.

90
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,864
Why, thank you,
Mr. Vulcan.

91
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,251
Seven?

92
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:47,795
My visual processors
and motor cortex--

93
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,340
they are malfunctioning.

94
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,301
Sounds like a problem
with your cortical implant.

95
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,344
We'd better have a look.

96
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,556
Hold still.

97
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,391
I cannot comply.

98
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:00,975
You're intoxicated.

99
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,352
Impossible.

100
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,729
Your blood synthehol
level is .05 percent.

101
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,856
How many glasses of
champagne did you consume?

102
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,191
One.

103
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,193
Obviously, the Borg
can't hold their liquor.

104
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,861
Come to Sick Bay.

105
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,406
I'll give you some inaprovaline
to counteract the effects.

106
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,450
I was simply trying
to perfect my social skills

107
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,742
as you instructed me to do.

108
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,160
And you're doing
a fine job.

109
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:22,663
You have always been

110
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,541
of enormous assistance
to me, Doctor.

111
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,709
You... you are my mentor.

112
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,128
Yes.

113
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,297
We are as one.

114
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,548
We are as one.

115
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:35,802
Did you see that?

116
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,262
Hmm.

117
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:40,557
I think our drone did
a little too much celebrating.

118
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,934
Speaking of which, when are
you going to join the party?

119
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:45,186
In a minute.

120
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,482
You're running a warp core
diagnostic now?

121
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:52,486
Harry, I think
we built an Edsel.

122
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,820
A what?

123
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,864
A lemon; a disaster
waiting to happen.

124
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:00,368
I ran a simulation
last night

125
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,870
and I discovered a
.42 phase variance

126
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,998
in the slipstream
threshold.

127
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,750
.42? So it'll be a bumpy ride.

128
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,336
We've flown through worse.

129
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,921
If we get knocked out of that
slipstream mid-flight...

130
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,591
it could overload
the quantum matrix.

131
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,925
Did you tell the Captain?

132
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,260
Not yet.

133
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,262
I didn't want to spoil
the festivities

134
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:20,430
until I was sure.

135
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,057
Tom, if it'll make you
feel better,

136
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,767
we'll go
to the holodeck right now,

137
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,019
run a few more simulations.

138
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,646
It's probably
just a sensor glitch.

139
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,649
PARIS:
We're at full impulse.

140
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:33,067
KIM:
Engaging slipstream drive.

141
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,320
Quantum field is stable.

142
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,238
Deflector at maximum.

143
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:42,577
Slipstream velocity
in four, three, two...

144
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,248
PARIS:
Power output is steady.

145
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,876
Quantum field is holding.

146
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,170
Shields down to 73 percent.

147
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,547
Looking good.

148
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,507
Keep that deflector aligned
and we should be...

149
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,342
(<i> console beeps insistently</i> )

150
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,260
We've got a phase variance--
point one.

151
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,595
Point two.

152
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,597
Remodulate the deflector.

153
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,182
No effect.
Point four.

154
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,600
I'm shutting down the drive.

155
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,602
No, wait. I want to invert
the quantum field.

156
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:08,936
It's no use.

157
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,022
That slipstream is collapsing.

158
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,402
Inertial dampers are off-line.

159
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:16,819
<i>Warning.</i>
<i>Hull breach on Deck 10.</i>

160
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,488
We're losing
structural integrity.

161
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,532
Computer, freeze program!

162
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,701
(<i> sighs</i> )

163
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,327
One more time.
I think if we reroute

164
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,745
emergency power to the deflector
a little earlier...

165
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:27,914
It won't help.

166
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,082
Computer,

167
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,791
restart simulation
at time index...

168
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,043
Computer,
belay that order.

169
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,420
It's no use, Harry.

170
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,962
We can't just give up.

171
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,257
23 simulations, 23 catastrophes.

172
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,259
This is no sensor glitch.

173
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,845
(<i> sighs</i> )

174
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,222
We've got to tell them.

175
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,682
TORRES:
That can't be right.

176
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,101
We tested this engine
molecule by molecule.

177
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,728
I'm sorry, B'Elanna.

178
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:52,146
SEVEN:
I wish to examine
the results of the simulation.

179
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,274
Holodeck 2--
run them for yourself.

180
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,068
That is, if you don't mind being
vaporized a few dozen times.

181
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,070
I looked at their
findings, Captain.

182
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,281
If we try to take that
flight in the morning,

183
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,074
we'll be in escape
pods by afternoon.

184
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,868
TUVOK:
It would appear we have
no choice but to cancel it.

185
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:09,247
Either that or...

186
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,165
we can try it
Harry's way.

187
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,251
JANEWAY:
Ensign?

188
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,671
(<i> sighs</i> )

189
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,880
I've got an idea.

190
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,049
It's tricky, but I
think it could work.

191
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,052
The trouble begins about 17
seconds into the flight.

192
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,596
The phase variance kicks in

193
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,556
and the slipstream
becomes unstable.

194
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,600
What we need is
someone in a shuttle

195
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,310
to ride the rapids
in front of<i> Voyager.</i>

196
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,186
TORRES:
Yes.

197
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:35,064
They could map the threshold of
the slipstream as it's forming

198
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,899
and send the phase corrections
back to us.

199
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,277
That is a great idea, Harry.

200
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:42,322
Now, here's the tricky part.

201
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,158
The shuttle will only be

202
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,452
a couple of seconds
ahead of<i> Voyager.</i>

203
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,203
That doesn't give
auto-navigation

204
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,829
much time to compensate.

205
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,082
Tom?

206
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,917
Couple of seconds?

207
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,419
KIM:
We can do this, Captain.

208
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:57,712
Put me on that shuttle.

209
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,047
I'll get<i> Voyager</i>
through the slipstream.

210
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,428
What choice do we have?

211
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,638
Take the drive off-line?

212
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,181
Months of work for nothing?

213
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,642
We built a highly experimental
piece of technology.

214
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:12,185
There were bound
to be setbacks.

215
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,521
The benamite crystals
at the heart of this engine

216
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,105
have already started to decay.

217
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,359
It could take years
to synthesize more.

218
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,445
I don't know about
the rest of you,

219
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,113
but I didn't do all this work

220
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:28,284
just to be stopped
by a .42 phase variance.

221
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,661
No offense, Captain.

222
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:32,079
None taken.

223
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,165
All right, Mr. Kim...

224
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,626
you've convinced me.

225
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:37,960
Prepare a flight plan

226
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,463
and have it on my desk
within the hour.

227
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,131
Yes, ma'am.

228
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,342
I'll let you know
what I decide.

229
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,310
(<i> door chimes</i> )

230
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,395
Come in.

231
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,274
Commander, I hope
you've got an appetite.

232
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,652
Famished, but I assumed
you called me here

233
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,195
to talk about
the slipstream flight.

234
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,531
No reason to cancel
our dinner plans.

235
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,325
I've programmed a dish

236
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,703
my grandmother used to
make back on Earth--

237
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,538
vegetable biryani.

238
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:14,581
Sounds delicious.

239
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,750
I didn't know
you could cook.

240
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,293
Normally, I draw the
line at a pot of coffee,

241
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,838
but tonight
is a special occasion.

242
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,964
Oh?

243
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,092
Our last night in
the Delta Quadrant.

244
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,719
I'd say that's
special enough.

245
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,389
You've made your decision.

246
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,391
We launch tomorrow at 0800.

247
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,602
You and Harry will
take the<i> Delta Flyer.</i>

248
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,311
<i>Voyager</i> will be
right behind you.

249
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,442
The crew will be pleased.

250
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,444
You can give them
the news yourself...

251
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,279
after dessert.

252
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,200
What about you, Chakotay?

253
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,952
What do you think
about my decision?

254
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,123
(<i> sighs</i> )

255
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,584
I've analyzed
Harry's flight plan.

256
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,210
The theory is sound,

257
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,212
but there are just
too many variables.

258
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,214
If something goes wrong
in that slipstream...

259
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,592
This could be our only chance
to use the quantum drive.

260
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:10,470
True, but if you
showed this data

261
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,555
to any Starfleet engineer,

262
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:15,850
they'd think we were
out of our minds.

263
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,393
We can find another way home.

264
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,645
We've waited this long.

265
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,605
Long enough. We've
waited long enough.

266
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:26,319
I know it's a risk...

267
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,572
probably our
biggest one yet...

268
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,198
but I'm willing
to take it.

269
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,450
Are you with me?

270
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,035
Always.

271
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,126
Speaking of risks...

272
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,757
are you ready to try
some home cooking?

273
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,550
I'll alert Sick Bay.

274
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:10,864
15 years?

275
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,573
Give or take
a few weeks.

276
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,700
Where are we?

277
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,993
In the Takara sector

278
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,494
just outside
the Alpha Quadrant.

279
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:17,662
The crew?

280
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:18,830
Except for
us... dead.

281
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,289
We think Captain Janeway

282
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,376
tried to make an emergency
landing on this planet.

283
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,879
The ship must have been
too heavily damaged.

284
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,630
They were all killed on impact.

285
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,507
You've been buried
inside a glacier

286
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,009
for the past 15 years.

287
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:34,929
You two were here,
on the<i> Delta Flyer</i>

288
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,639
ahead of<i> Voyager.</i>

289
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:37,932
You made it.

290
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,851
All the way
back to Earth.

291
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,394
We got home, Doc,

292
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,689
and all it took was killing
everyone we cared about.

293
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,858
Harry.

294
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:49,360
Starfleet certainly took
their time finding us.

295
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,195
Starfleet...

296
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:55,074
Starfleet gave up their search
for<i> Voyager</i> over nine years ago.

297
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,201
We had to find you on our own.

298
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:01,706
Well, I don't know what
to say except... thank you.

299
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:05,209
I suppose I'd have stayed
in that deep freeze forever.

300
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,211
We're not here
to salvage your program.

301
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:10,089
We're here to prevent this
disaster from ever happening.

302
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,050
KIM:
You see, Doc,

303
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,386
15 years ago, I miscalculated
the slipstream threshold

304
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:18,598
and transmitted the wrong phase
corrections to<i> Voyager.</i>

305
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,182
Boom.

306
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,309
They were knocked
out of the slipstream

307
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,770
and sent to an icy death.

308
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,229
"Thank you, Ensign Kim."

309
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,439
But I've had
a long time

310
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,941
to rethink
my mistake,

311
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:31,151
and now I know how to fix it.

312
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:35,197
So... we're going
to send<i> Voyager</i>

313
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,241
a new set of phase corrections.

314
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,621
Isn't it a little late for that?

315
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,331
We've found a way to communicate
with<i> Voyager</i> in the past,

316
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,750
just before the accident.

317
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,043
Better late than never.

318
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,462
A message back through time?

319
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,463
Exactly.

320
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,547
How?

321
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,389
I don't understand.

322
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,975
One of her cranial implants

323
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,267
is a transceiver

324
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,352
designed to communicate
with other drones.

325
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,605
That's right. It's called
an interplexing beacon.

326
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,065
We want you
to extract the beacon

327
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,733
and determine
its translink frequency.

328
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,110
That shouldn't
be a problem.

329
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,320
She looks reasonably
well-preserved.

330
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,948
Good. That'll tell us
where to send the message.

331
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:20,034
Now, the hard part--
we need to know when to send it.

332
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,495
Can you access Seven's
chronometric node

333
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,164
and pinpoint the exact moment
her cybernetic implants

334
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,708
disengaged from her
organic systems?

335
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,168
Her time of death?

336
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,878
Down to the millisecond,
if possible.

337
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,546
I'll see what
I can do.

338
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,298
I told you he'd come in handy.

339
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,343
You said you'd
found a way

340
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,137
to communicate with
Seven in the past.

341
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:40,179
How?

342
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,020
Behold...
Salvage Component 36698--

343
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,856
a Borg temporal transmitter.

344
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:52,316
CHAKOTAY:
Starfleet Intelligence
found it

345
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,694
in the wreckage of a Borg cube
in the Beta Quadrant.

346
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:55,820
We stole it.

347
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,571
(<i> door opens</i> )

348
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,658
Trouble.

349
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:03,077
Long-range sensors are picking
up a Federation vessel.

350
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,662
How much time
do we have?

351
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,914
I entered a low orbit and
remodulated our shields,

352
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,666
but it won't be long
before they find us.

353
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,001
Six hours if
we're lucky.

354
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,669
Let me get
this straight...

355
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:13,713
you're fugitives?

356
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,422
"Galaxy's Most Wanted."

357
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,884
We stole
the<i> Delta Flyer,</i> too...

358
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,969
right out
of a Federation shipyard.

359
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,055
We're wanted on two counts
of high treason

360
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,974
and conspiracy to violate
the Temporal Prime Directive.

361
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,559
Wonderful.

362
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,144
Out of the icebox
and into the fire.

363
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,979
We don't have time
for this. Get started.

364
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,313
Aye, sir.

365
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,607
We still have to retrieve
those sensor logs.

366
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,692
Get ready.

367
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,157
Hello, Doctor.

368
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,575
Do I know you?

369
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,702
No, but I feel like
we're old friends.

370
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:45,703
Tessa Omond.

371
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,496
Hello.

372
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,791
It's an honor to finally meet
<i>Voyager's</i> infamous EMH.

373
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,376
"Infamous"?

374
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,920
I've told her
a few horror stories.

375
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,504
TESSA:
Actually,

376
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,673
they've always spoken
very highly of you.

377
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,633
Uh-huh... and how did
you get involved

378
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,219
with Bonnie and Clyde here?

379
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:04,222
Oh, I've had an interest
in<i> Voyager</i> for a long time.

380
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:05,848
They're having sex.

381
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,516
Pardon?

382
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,393
Chakotay and Tess.

383
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,604
They're a couple;
joined at the hip.

384
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,857
The truth is, Doctor,

385
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,610
I didn't want Chakotay or Harry
to have to face this alone.

386
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,736
I thought I could help.

387
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,322
Ready?

388
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,407
Stay warm.

389
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,880
TESSA:
These controls
are a little clumsy.

390
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,841
I thought you said this ship
was state of the art.

391
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,218
CHAKOTAY:
It was at the time.

392
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,553
I've located
the sensor logs,

393
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,974
but... the computer
is denying me access.

394
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,896
My command codes should
still carry some weight.

395
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,659
Hmm... looks like there's
an active file here.

396
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,828
(<i> static</i> )

397
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,705
JANEWAY:
<i>...but should our luck run out,</i>
<i>I'd like to say for the record</i>

398
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,374
<i>that the crew of</i> Voyager acted
<i>with distinction and valor.</i>

399
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,043
(<i> recording ends</i> )

400
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,589
You okay?

401
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,010
Yes.

402
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,639
It's just...

403
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,558
the last time
I was in this chair,

404
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,811
they were all here...

405
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:35,437
alive.

406
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,235
We're here to
get them back.

407
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:46,866
Can I see that tricorder?

408
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,130
It's downloading.

409
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,882
Give it a minute.

410
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:10,472
I don't supposed we have time
for a tour?

411
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,390
Afraid not.

412
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:17,230
Besides, I left
my quarters a mess.

413
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,362
In just a few hours,
if all goes as planned,

414
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:26,613
we'll have changed history.

415
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:30,368
The past 15 years... erased.

416
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:32,703
We don't have to do this.

417
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:34,914
Now you tell me.

418
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,291
I'm serious.

419
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:41,419
So am I, and I have no
intentions of backing out.

420
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:49,053
Chakotay...

421
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:54,183
Look at me...

422
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:57,270
last minute jitters,
cold feet...

423
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,521
I don't know what to call it.

424
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,107
Ridiculous, isn't it?

425
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:04,277
After all these years,
working toward this moment

426
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:08,281
and when it finally comes,

427
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:11,825
all I can think about
is losing you.

428
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:15,246
Your heart has always
been here, on<i> Voyager.</i>

429
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:17,455
That'll never change.

430
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:20,042
This is where you belong.

431
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:24,297
And who knows?

432
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:26,715
Maybe we'll meet someday.

433
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,885
But if we don't...?

434
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,512
Then I'll miss you
all the same.

435
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,020
...means all of that
has changed.

436
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,315
You owe me one.

437
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:44,942
DOCTOR:
Mr. Kim, your
assistance, please.

438
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:46,652
Got to go.

439
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,700
What was that all about?

440
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,785
Oh, nothing.

441
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,120
Letter to a friend.

442
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,288
How does it look?

443
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,165
No damage
to the infrastructure,

444
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,041
but I'll need
an isoprobe.

445
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,336
Way ahead of you, Doc.

446
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:10,468
So, what
was it like,

447
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:12,386
your homecoming?

448
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:16,932
Antimatter fireworks,
longwinded dignitaries,

449
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,851
a Vulcan children's choir.

450
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,854
Oh, we got medals
pinned to our tunics.

451
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:25,107
Chakotay gave a speech
commemorating the<i> Voyager</i> crew.

452
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,109
Brought a tear
to everyone's eye.

453
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:30,528
Admiral MacIntyre even wanted me
to marry his daughter.

454
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:34,741
At least you weren't buried
under 20 meters of ice.

455
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:39,872
You don't know how many times
I wished I was.

456
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,460
I suppose
it must have been difficult

457
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:49,382
with all your friends
and colleagues left behind.

458
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,011
"Survivor guilt."

459
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,971
Yeah. I heard a lot about that

460
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,640
from the counselors
back at Headquarters.

461
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,395
"You must learn to accept
the fact that you lived.

462
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:04,480
"Embrace life.

463
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,899
Move forward."

464
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,402
I signed on to the first
deep space vessel

465
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:11,278
I could find.

466
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,280
We tried to calculate
where<i> Voyager</i>

467
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,533
might have fallen
out of the slipstream.

468
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,451
Four years of searching.

469
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:19,078
We were close.

470
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,578
I could feel it.

471
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,915
Then, Starfleet Command
said it was time

472
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:23,957
to end the search.

473
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:27,336
"Low probability of success."

474
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:30,797
All those admirals who shook
my hand at the homecoming--

475
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,759
I went to see
every last one of them...

476
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,845
begged them
to keep the search alive.

477
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,431
Pretty soon

478
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:41,141
even Admiral MacIntyre
stopped returning my calls.

479
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,395
So I resigned from Starfleet.

480
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:49,567
For the record,

481
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:55,613
Seven's translink
frequency is 108.44236000.

482
00:26:56,574 --> 00:26:58,409
Could be our lucky number.

483
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:00,660
I'm encoding it now.

484
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,622
When did you embark
on your life of crime?

485
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:10,754
The second I heard
about this little gem.

486
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,799
Mr. Kim, did you ever stop

487
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,760
to think about
what you're trying to do here?

488
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,012
Altering the timeline
may make things worse.

489
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,181
At least
you and Chakotay survived.

490
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,724
Why tempt fate?

491
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,935
This "timeline" only exists

492
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:27,104
because I made a mistake
15 years ago.

493
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:30,608
The crew trusted in me
and I let them down.

494
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:32,109
COMPUTER:
<i>Tactical alert.</i>

495
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:36,489
<i>Vessel approaching,</i>
<i>bearing 184 mark 7.</i>

496
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,080
They've found us.

497
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,039
Chakotay.

498
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,333
<i>Go ahead.</i>

499
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,876
Starfleet's on an
intercept course.

500
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,462
It's now or never.

501
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:52,588
<i>We're on our way.</i>

502
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:57,968
If you're having
doubts, let me know.

503
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:59,970
I'll take your
program off-line.

504
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:03,223
But if you're with us,

505
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,476
we tempt fate together.

506
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,523
To aid an honorable thief

507
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:14,652
or to spend eternity
in cybernetic oblivion?

508
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:17,571
Let's tempt fate.

509
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:31,960
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 52143.6.</i>

510
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,129
<i>With any luck,</i>
<i>my next log entry</i>

511
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,298
<i>will be made</i>
<i>in the Alpha Quadrant,</i>

512
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:39,385
<i>but should our luck run out,</i>
<i>I'd like to say for the record</i>

513
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:43,389
<i>that the crew of</i> Voyager<i> acted</i>
<i>with distinction and valor.</i>

514
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:44,806
Shield generators?

515
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,392
On line.

516
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:47,726
Plasma flow?

517
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,977
Stable.

518
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,062
Com-link?

519
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,605
Secure.

520
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:52,690
Lunch?

521
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:55,025
Salami sandwiches.

522
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,028
Feel up to this, Ensign?

523
00:28:58,028 --> 00:28:59,697
Yes, sir.

524
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:01,615
Chakotay to<i> Voyager.</i>

525
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:02,866
We're ready.

526
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,827
All hands, this is the Captain.

527
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,247
Take your stations,

528
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:11,250
secure all systems,

529
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,127
and stand by
for the jump to slipstream.

530
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,343
I've established a telemetry
link with the shuttle.

531
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,303
Match their course and speed.

532
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,604
They're gaining on us.

533
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:33,397
200,000 kilometers
and closing.

534
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,608
You call these
evasive maneuvers?

535
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:37,109
I'm doing my best.

536
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,652
Harry, status?

537
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:40,904
The Borg transmitter's on line,
but I'm still waiting

538
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,240
for the Doctor to give me
the temporal coordinates.

539
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,157
Just a few more minutes.

540
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,701
<i>Speed it up.</i>

541
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,869
<i>We've got a Galaxy-class</i>
<i>starship on our tail.</i>

542
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,246
I'm working as fast as I can.

543
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:51,039
They're hailing us.

544
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,750
You want to
talk to them?

545
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,127
It could buy us some time.

546
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,878
Open a channel.

547
00:29:56,878 --> 00:30:00,257
<i>This is Captain La Forge</i>
<i>of the Starship</i> Challenger.

548
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:01,759
<i>You seem to be</i>
<i>in quite a hurry.</i>

549
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,260
You could say that.

550
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,012
<i>Why don't you shut down</i>
<i>those impulse engines,</i>

551
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:09,015
<i>drop your shields and let's</i>
<i>talk about this face-to-face?</i>

552
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,684
Mind if I take a rain check?

553
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,519
<i>As a matter of fact, I do.</i>

554
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,480
<i>We know what you're</i>
<i>about to attempt</i>

555
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,315
<i>and we can't let that happen,</i>

556
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:19,192
<i>so the Federation Council is</i>
<i>willing to make you an offer--</i>

557
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:22,321
<i>hand over the Borg transmitter,</i>
<i>stand down your vessel</i>

558
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,823
<i>and the charges of conspiracy</i>
<i>will be dropped.</i>

559
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,325
That's not much of an offer.

560
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:27,909
If we succeed, those charges

561
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,995
will never have existed
in the first place.

562
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,790
<i>If you succeed, countless lives</i>
<i>will be affected.</i>

563
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:36,502
We're here to save 150 lives--
our crew.

564
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:38,128
<i>I understand and I might</i>

565
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:40,964
<i>be doing the same thing</i>
<i>if I were in your position,</i>

566
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,508
<i>but I've got my own crew</i>
<i>to protect,</i>

567
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:45,093
<i>not to mention</i>
<i>15 years of history,</i>

568
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:48,847
<i>so... I'm asking you again.</i>

569
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:52,225
<i>Stand down</i>
<i>and return the transmitter.</i>

570
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,394
You know I can't do that.

571
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,605
<i>And you know</i>
<i>I have to try to stop you.</i>

572
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,524
Yes, I know.

573
00:30:58,524 --> 00:30:59,899
Good luck.

574
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,110
<i>Same to you.</i>

575
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,406
(<i> rumbling</i> )

576
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,325
They're targeting our engines.

577
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:09,868
Shields to full.

578
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,203
Stand by weapons.

579
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,752
<i>Voyager</i> to Chakotay.

580
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:20,128
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

581
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,088
Prepare to enter the slipstream.

582
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,424
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

583
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,092
Engage.

584
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:34,393
Slipstream velocity
in four, three, two...

585
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,235
Shields down to 62 percent.

586
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:46,029
Return fire.

587
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,407
Direct hit.
No effect on their shields.

588
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,534
We're no match for them,
Chakotay.

589
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:51,618
Keep trying.

590
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,705
I don't mean
to be a pest,

591
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:56,122
but we're losing
power back here.

592
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,876
Hold on. We're switching
to emergency backup.

593
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:00,669
(<i> power revving up</i> )

594
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,128
Thank you.

595
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:05,591
Doc, I need those
temporal coordinates now.

596
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,426
Badgering me won't help.

597
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,970
I'm detecting
a phase variance--

598
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:14,266
point one, point two...

599
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,308
Helm?

600
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,685
I'm still waiting for Harry.

601
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:17,811
Point three.

602
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:18,896
<i>Voyager</i> to<i> Delta Flyer.</i>

603
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:20,939
We need those corrections

604
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,900
<i>or we'll have</i>
<i>to shut down the drive.</i>

605
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,025
We're on it, Captain.

606
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,905
The threshold is fluctuating.

607
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:31,533
Okay. I can do this.

608
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:35,829
I'm compensating
for the spatial gradients...

609
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:39,332
Deflector geometry stable.

610
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,795
Got it!

611
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,715
I'm receiving
the phase corrections.

612
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,967
The phase variance
is decreasing.

613
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,427
Shields are holding.

614
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:53,430
Looks like we're on our way.

615
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,099
Phase variance is increasing.

616
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,811
Point three... point four.

617
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:00,270
Harry, what's happening?

618
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:03,523
<i>The phase variance</i>
<i>is still increasing.</i>

619
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,024
I-I'm not sure, Captain.

620
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,610
It should be working.

621
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:07,861
<i>I need an answer, Harry.</i>

622
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,154
We're running out of time.

623
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:13,032
Let me try
recalibrating the sensors.

624
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:16,328
(<i> staticky</i> ):
<i>I might be overcompensating</i>
<i>for the variance in the...</i>

625
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:19,080
(<i> transmission fades to static)</i>

626
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,373
We've lost our com-link.

627
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,042
Telemetry's down, too.

628
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,628
The slipstream's destabilizing.

629
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:25,712
Shut down the drive!

630
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,172
I can't.

631
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,466
There's some kind of overload
in the quantum matrix.

632
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:31,176
I've lost helm control.

633
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:33,804
I have it.

634
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:35,639
Her cybernetic systems
were terminated

635
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:38,308
on Stardate 52164.3,

636
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:41,561
Borg time index 9.43852.

637
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,065
You're encoding
the transmitter

638
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,150
for time index 9.40?

639
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,861
Uh-huh.

640
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:51,530
That's less than four minutes
before<i> Voyager</i> was destroyed.

641
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,031
Cutting it a little close,
aren't we?

642
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,658
This is no ordinary
phone call, Doc.

643
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:55,868
We're talking to yesterday.

644
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:57,452
Timing is everything.

645
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,746
I want to make sure Seven
of Nine gets the information

646
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:00,873
at just the right moment.

647
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,667
There.

648
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,839
I'm bringing up
the new phase corrections.

649
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:14,052
This was where I failed
15 years ago, Doc.

650
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,471
This time will be different.

651
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,475
(<i> beeping</i> )

652
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,898
Captain, I am receiving
a transmission.

653
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:27,482
You said the com-link was down.

654
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,734
It is.

655
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,193
The signal is being routed

656
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,987
through one
of my cranial implants.

657
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,907
It contains
a new set of phase corrections.

658
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:37,158
Does Harry know how to access
your Borg systems?

659
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,577
No.

660
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,245
He must have figured out a way.

661
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,454
Enter the corrections.

662
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,418
They're not compensating
for the phase variance.

663
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,127
The slipstream is collapsing.

664
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,713
Full power to the deflector.

665
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,506
No effect.

666
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,967
Our hull is buckling.

667
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,844
Shields at maximum.
Hold her steady, Tom.

668
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,971
It's no use.
We're losing attitude control.

669
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:02,141
Inertial dampers off-line!

670
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,393
What about the<i> Delta Flyer?</i>

671
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:04,853
There is no sign of them.

672
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,813
They must have remained
in the slipstream.

673
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,692
<i>Voyager's</i> been thrown
into normal space.

674
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,069
Alter our
slipstream course.

675
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:13,445
We've got to go back.

676
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,739
We can't. Even if
they survived reentry

677
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,198
at this velocity,
we wouldn't.

678
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,158
What are you saying?
We've got to find them!

679
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,912
Ensign, there's no choice.

680
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:36,843
Captain, we're just a few
parsecs from the Alpha Quadrant.

681
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,304
Not exactly how I wanted
to cross the finish line.

682
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,765
Hull breach
on Decks 5 through 10.

683
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,182
We're losing life support.

684
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,019
If we don't land the ship,

685
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:47,771
we're risking
structural collapse.

686
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,901
I'm reading a planet
nine million kilometers ahead.

687
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,445
It's Class-L.

688
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:56,529
Do it.

689
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,912
We're coming in too fast.
Reverse thrusters.

690
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:07,290
All hands, brace for impact!

691
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:32,858
We're still here.

692
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,567
Why are we still here?

693
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,610
Mr. Kim?

694
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:38,780
The new phase corrections
didn't work.

695
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,239
Are you certain?

696
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,367
If<i> Voyager</i> had gotten
through safely,

697
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:45,037
we wouldn't still be here
trying to save them.

698
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:46,997
The transmitter's
functioning.

699
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:49,290
Seven must have received
our message.

700
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,334
Chakotay, problems!

701
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,377
I can see that.

702
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:55,463
Our engines are down.

703
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,716
They're locking on to us
with a tractor beam.

704
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,009
Full thrusters.

705
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,553
No effect.

706
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,516
Do we have enough power
to send a plasma surge

707
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:08,852
through their tractor beam;
break ourselves free?

708
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,187
I think so,

709
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:12,438
but the EPS relays
have taken heavy damage.

710
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,816
It could destabilize
the warp core.

711
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:16,818
If you want to beam
over to that ship,

712
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:17,986
I'll understand.

713
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:20,405
And let you have
all the fun?

714
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:26,745
Harry, we just bought you
a few more minutes.

715
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:27,746
Acknowledged.

716
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,164
I'm no time travel expert,

717
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,208
but can't we just
call<i> Voyager</i> again?

718
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:33,251
The past isn't
going anywhere.

719
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,460
That's not going to help

720
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,962
if we don't know what
to tell them.

721
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,505
(<i> console beeping</i> )

722
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:44,012
The slipstream
kinetics look right.

723
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:46,723
Hyperdimensional
progressions... perfect.

724
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,977
Maybe it's
the deflector geometry.

725
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,610
We're free.

726
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,486
The EPS relays
are overloading.

727
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:03,240
Harry, we're looking
at a possible core breach

728
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,158
in less than three minutes.

729
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:07,326
How's it coming back there?

730
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,328
Great! Just great!

731
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,790
It took me ten years
to make these corrections.

732
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,166
I can't fix it
in three minutes!

733
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:14,459
You've got to try!

734
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:17,670
I can't!
It's not working.

735
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,131
Why won't it work?!

736
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:22,675
I killed them!

737
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,843
Control yourself.

738
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,637
They trusted me,
and I killed them!

739
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,223
Mr. Kim! I didn't spend all
those years in an ice bucket,

740
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:30,183
so I could listen
to you berate yourself.

741
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:31,977
If you want to wallow
in self-pity, fine!

742
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:33,603
Do it on your own time!

743
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:36,189
Don't you see?
History's repeating itself.

744
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:39,484
I destroyed<i> Voyager</i> once,
and I'm doing it again!

745
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:42,612
Somebody has got to knuckle
down and change history

746
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,281
and that somebody is you.

747
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:46,741
It can't be done, Doc.
I told you.

748
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,076
No, you told me,

749
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,162
you can't correct
their phase variance.

750
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:51,788
All right.
We have to accept that.

751
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:54,166
But what about
sending<i> Voyager</i> a warning?

752
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:55,541
Is there a way to get them

753
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,543
to abort
the slipstream flight?

754
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,879
Yes. Yes!

755
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,464
I could send
a phase correction

756
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,549
which would disperse
the slipstream entirely.

757
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:04,759
If we can't get the crew home,

758
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,094
at least
we can save their lives!

759
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:09,222
Warning. Warp core breach
in 60 seconds.

760
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:11,141
Can you eject the core?

761
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:12,558
TESSA:
No.

762
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:13,893
Emergency systems are off-line.

763
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,687
<i>La Forge to</i> Delta Flyer.

764
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:18,564
<i>Our sensors are reading an</i>
<i>overload in your warp matrix.</i>

765
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,025
<i>Lower your shields.</i>

766
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:21,400
<i>We'll beam you out of there.</i>

767
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,029
I appreciate
the offer, Captain,

768
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,822
but the answer's no.

769
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:27,824
I suggest you get
to a safe distance.

770
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:32,245
COMPUTER:
<i>Warning. Warp core breach</i>
<i>in 45 seconds.</i>

771
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:35,081
Harry, now would be
a good time.

772
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,377
Mr. Kim!

773
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,837
It's losing power.

774
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,091
<i>Warning. Warp core breach</i>
<i>in 30 seconds.</i>

775
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,426
Your emitter. It's got
its own power source.

776
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:48,386
Would it be enough?

777
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,181
It's our only chance.

778
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:52,807
Glad you could
join us, Doc.

779
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:53,850
It's been a pleasure.

780
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:59,522
<i>Warning. Warp core breach</i>
<i>in 15 seconds.</i>

781
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:03,860
Chakotay,
I'm giving this one more try.

782
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:10,367
<i>Warning. Warp core breach in</i>
<i>ten, nine, eight, seven, six,</i>

783
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:14,246
<i>five, four, three, two, one...</i>

784
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:15,372
Yes!

785
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,838
Captain, I am receiving
a transmission.

786
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,673
I thought you said
the com-link was down.

787
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:26,966
It is.

788
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,509
The signal is being routed

789
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,553
through one
of my cranial implants.

790
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,223
It contains
a new set of phase corrections.

791
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:35,350
Does Harry know how to access
your Borg systems?

792
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,684
No.

793
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,270
He must have figured out a way.

794
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,645
Enter the corrections.

795
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,441
(<i> console beeping</i> )

796
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,111
Captain, the quantum drive
just went off-line.

797
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:47,653
We're dropping to impulse.

798
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:48,947
TUVOK:
Captain,

799
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,407
we've lost the slipstream.

800
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,207
The slipstream collapsed.

801
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:00,959
We were thrown out
right along

802
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:01,960
with<i> Voyager.</i>

803
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,919
Our com system's back up.

804
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:03,962
<i>Delta Flyer</i> to<i> Voyager.</i>

805
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,213
<i>What happened?</i>

806
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:07,506
You miscalculated, Harry.

807
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,342
We entered
the exact phase corrections

808
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:10,635
you sent to Seven of Nine.

809
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:13,512
They shut down
the quantum drive.

810
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,014
Captain,

811
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,725
I didn't send any corrections
to Seven of Nine.

812
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,895
She received a message

813
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,398
through one
of her cranial implants.

814
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:24,857
It wasn't you?

815
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:25,900
No, ma'am.

816
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:33,658
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

817
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:36,244
<i>Our slipstream flight</i>
<i>may have been brief,</i>

818
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:39,164
<i>but it took nearly ten years</i>
<i>off our journey.</i>

819
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:42,250
<i>I've given the order</i>
<i>to dismantle the quantum drive</i>

820
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,003
<i>until the technology</i>
<i>can be perfected.</i>

821
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:48,923
<i>Despite the setback, we have</i>
<i>a renewed sense of momentum.</i>

822
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:52,969
<i>It no longer seems a question</i>
<i>of</i> if<i> we get home, but when.</i>

823
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:03,604
At ease.

824
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:07,150
Am I interrupting?

825
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,901
No.

826
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,363
I just came here to try
to figure things out.

827
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:13,406
Phase corrections.

828
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:16,368
The corrections
I sent you were wrong.

829
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:17,702
If you had used them,

830
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,996
<i>Voyager</i> would have been
heavily damaged,

831
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,998
maybe even destroyed.

832
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:23,249
What I can't figure out

833
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,043
is who sent the other
phase corrections

834
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,669
to Seven of Nine.

835
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:29,297
Looks like we've got
a guardian angel.

836
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:31,257
Oh, I wish I could believe that.

837
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,675
Believe it.

838
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,927
His name is Harry Kim.

839
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,471
Captain?

840
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,808
Seven found a Starfleet
security code

841
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,353
embedded in the
transmission--

842
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:45,480
yours.

843
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,940
I'm telling you,
I didn't send it.

844
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,026
Not yet.

845
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:53,196
The transmission had
a temporal displacement.

846
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:56,324
We believe it originated
from the future--

847
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:58,576
ten, 20 years from now.

848
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,495
We can't be sure.

849
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:05,500
Wait a second.

850
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,336
If I sent a message
from the future

851
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:10,713
and changed the past,

852
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:15,634
then that future would
no longer exist, right?

853
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,970
So... how could I
have sent the message

854
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,347
in the first place?

855
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:21,099
Am I making any sense?

856
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:22,641
My advice in
making sense

857
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,977
of temporal
paradoxes is simple--

858
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,146
don't even try.

859
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:30,525
To me...

860
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:33,236
all that matters
is that somewhere

861
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:37,615
somehow... sometime,

862
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:41,786
you'll come through for us.

863
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:44,789
Well, if you won't
take it from me,

864
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,499
take it from you.

865
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:54,257
Seven found a log entry
encoded in the telemetry...

866
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:58,136
from Harry Kim

867
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:00,805
to Harry Kim.

868
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,417
<i>Hello, Harry.</i>

869
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:33,296
<i>I don't have much time</i>
<i>so listen to me.</i>

870
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:39,302
<i>15 years ago, I made a mistake</i>
<i>and 150 people died.</i>

871
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:42,972
<i>I've spent every day since then</i>
<i>regretting that mistake,</i>

872
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:45,475
<i>but if you're watching</i>
<i>this right now,</i>

873
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:48,520
<i>that means all</i>
<i>of that's changed.</i>

874
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,438
<i>You owe me one.</i>

875
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:54,108
DOCTOR:
<i>Mr. Kim, your</i>
<i>assistance, please.</i>

876
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,985
<i>Got to go.</i>

877
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:03,242
(<i> sighs</i> )
