I require your assistance
in Jefferies Tube 37-Alpha.

00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,395
Well, can it wait?

5
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,480
I just got off duty.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,481
It is urgent.

7
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:23,732
Hmm.

14
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,226
Is anybody here?

18
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:07,359
One more orbit and I should have
all the data we need.

19

23
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,578
Hello, sir.

(<i> sighs</i> )

25
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,021
It looks to me

26
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,774
like you aligned
the power couplings perfectly.

27
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,025
I did.

28
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,111
If you're so sure,

29
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,113
then why'd you need
me to look at them?

30
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,907
I did not.

31
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:56,491
(<i> laughs</i> )

32
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,285
Then what's
this all about?

33
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:01,246
I've learned from observing
Lieutenants Torres and Paris

34
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,540
that humans sometimes
require a pretext

35
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,375
for being intimate
with one another.

36
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,462
Intimate?

00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,633

My primary warp manifold

00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,772
I've lost helm control.

45
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,398
Auxiliary power is off-line.

00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,775

I don't think I can hold it.

Where is everybody?

57
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,050
Didn't you see them
when you came in?

58
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,051
No.

59
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,260
Take a look.

60
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,982

It appears that, in my haste
to report to the Bridge,

I neglected
to put on my uniform.

Good morning.

Sleep well?

00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,710
Not really.

87
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,962
What are you doing here?

88
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,091
I just thought
I'd stop by and ask you

89
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,509
why you didn't meet me
for breakfast.

90
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,635
Breakfast...

91
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,221
What time is it?

92
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,389
7:40.

93
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:13,308
And we were supposed
to meet at 0700.

94
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,726
I was there--

95
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,396
right after I got
off the night shift.

96
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,022
I waited... and I waited

97
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,899
and I called you on the com.

98
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,026
I... uh... I-I
didn't hear you.

99
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,153
I was having this
wild nightmare.

100
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,696
I was out like a light.

101
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,740
I'm sorry. I'll get
dressed right now.

102
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,951
You don't have time. You're due
on the Bridge at 0800,

103
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,411
and I've got
to get some sleep.

104
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,621
Oh, I hate this!

105
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,374
We never see each other.

106
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,586
I'm off Friday night.

107
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,297
Great.

108
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:44,881
Let's go skiing.

109
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,342
How about Saint Moritz?

110
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,261
We went skiing
last time.

111
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,595
And you loved it.

112
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,264
You're getting
really good, you know.

113
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:55,225
I just thought maybe
we could run a program

114
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:58,228
where the wind chill factor
wasn't 30 below zero...

115
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,397
like... Fiji

116
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,606
or Samoa.

117
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,400
Oh. There's nothing
to do there.

118
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,737
And you can be warm while
you're not doing it.

119
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,324
How about a compromise?

120
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:11,699
Um...

121
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,327
spring skiing in Chile?

122
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,453
Much warmer.

123
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:17,414
A compromise...

124
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,667
How about Tahiti?

125
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,543
Hmm. Tahiti.

126
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,007
As long as I can
go waterskiing, fine.

127
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,133
You're on.

128
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,681
Now, go get dressed,

129
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,725
so you'll at least have time
to stop for some coffee.

130
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,811
I'll see you Friday night.

131
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:47,986
(<i> sighs</i> )

132
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:48,945
Morning, Tom.

133
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,905
Mm.
What will it be?

134
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,573
Scrambled, sunny-side up,
over easy?

135
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,993
Just a cup of coffee.
Are you sure?

136
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,496
Breakfast is the most important
meal of the day, you know.

137
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:58,746
Neelix!
Right.

138
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,301
Uh...

139
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,593
Neelix...

140
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,929
did you have a rough
night or something?

141
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,556
Why do you ask?

142
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,518
Because you just poured me
a steaming cup of cooking oil.

143
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,523
Actually, I did have

144
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,649
a little trouble sleeping
last night.

145
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:27,775
Nightmares.

146
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,818
Oh.

147
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,529
Me, too.

148
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,447
Must have been
those three full moons

149
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,698
we passed yesterday.

150
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,492
Well, a few sips of my coffee

151
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,744
should clear the fuzz
out of your brain.

152
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,247
Maybe you should pour yourself
a cup while you're at it.

153
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,802
Seem to be
a little shorthanded today.

154
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,471
Tom and Harry
are both late.

155
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,390
I was going to give them
another five minutes,

156
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,100
but I'll call them now,
if you'd like.

157
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,226
That's all right.

158
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,727
I'm a little late myself,
aren't I?

159
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,396
I wasn't going to mention it.

160
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,231
Burning the midnight oil?

161
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,982
Actually, I went to bed early
for a change,

162
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,527
but I had a nightmare and
I could not get back to sleep.

163
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,529
I had a bad dream
last night, too.

164
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,240
You tell me yours and
I'll tell you mine.

165
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,908
Sorry I'm late,
Captain.

166
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,496
Well?

167
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,706
I was in the forest
with my father.

168
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:27,794
We were hunting deer,
which was odd,

169
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,046
because that was something
I always refused to do.

170
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,672
We cornered the animal.

171
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,634
I looked to my father to see
if he was going to kill it,

172
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,428
but he wasn't my father anymore.

173
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,346
He was a vicious-looking alien.

174
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,932
There was an alien
in my dream, too.

175
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:45,645
And it wasn't from any race
I've seen before. He had...

176
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,649
sharp ridges on his forehead
and on the front of his neck.

177
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,526
That's what mine looked like.

178
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,861
I don't mean
to be eavesdropping, but...

179
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,822
I had a nightmare
last night, too,

180
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,283
and I'm pretty sure
I saw the same guy.

181
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,077
Tuvok?

182
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,412
By any chance

183
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,705
did you have a bad dream
last night?

184
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:08,585
I did have a somewhat
unsettling dream, yes.

185
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,379
It involved an alien
with ridges

186
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,214
on his face and neck.

187
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:16,717
I'd say this sounds like
more than a coincidence.

188
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,761
Let's get the rest
of the senior staff together

189
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,054
and come up with some answers.

190
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,431
Which reminds me, where's Harry?

191
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,517
Bridge to Ensign Kim.

192
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,312
Computer, locate Ensign Kim.

193
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,314
<i>Ensign Kim is in his quarters.</i>

194
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,689
Tuvok.

195
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,323
Deck 6.

196
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,907
I've got a hunch

197
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,869
Harry's dreaming about
our new alien friend.

198
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,413
That would be consistent
with the experiences

199
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,789
the rest of us have had.

200
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,583
Tell me more
about your dream.

201
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,168
Where exactly did
you see the alien?

202
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,295
As a matter of fact, it was
here in the turbolift.

203
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,796
What happened?

204
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,632
The alien simply stared at me

205
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,092
as if scrutinizing
my appearance.

206
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,844
That's what happened
in my dream.

207
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,012
What did you do?

208
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,764
I returned to my quarters.

209
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,559
Did the alien follow you?

210
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,019
He did.

211
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,354
And then?

212
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,690
He watched me.

213
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,815
Doing what?

214
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,776
Getting dressed.

215
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,698
Getting dressed?

216
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,991
Yes.

217
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:26,496
I don't suppose I should ask
why you were undressed.

218
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,873
I would prefer
that you didn't.

219
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:40,927
(<i> door buzzes</i> )

220
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,345
Harry?

221
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,557
Harry?

222
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:47,766
Computer,
open door 105-2.

223
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:50,937
Security clearance:
Tuvok-zeta-nine.

224
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,531
Harry?

225
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,038
Harry, wake up.

226
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,466
Are they comatose?

227
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,092
Not exactly.

228
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:24,011
They all appear to be
in a hyper-REM state.

229
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,347
I've tried every conventional
method of waking them--

230
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,391
from drugs to direct
cortical stimulation--

231
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:29,684
but nothing works.

232
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,936
Do you have any idea
what's causing this?

233
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:35,774
Scans haven't detected
any viral or bacterial agents.

234
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:38,067
No cranial trauma,
no neural disorders.

235
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,028
They're simply... asleep.

236
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,664
I'd say it's a pretty good bet

237
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:51,706
this is somehow related

238
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,916
to the alien
from our dreams.

239
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,002
Any progress
in identifying him?

240
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,920
Not yet, but I've got
everyone working on it.

241
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,214
In the meantime,
what's your recommendation?

242
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,091
Large doses of animazine.

243
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,135
I thought you said
drugs weren't working.

244
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,053
Not for them.
For everybody else.

245
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,306
Until I can determine
what's happening

246
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:11,017
I'd suggest the rest of you
avoid going to sleep.

247
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,984
I'd say his ridges were
a little more pronounced.

248
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,654
Computer, increase
facial ridge height

249
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,739
by four centimeters.

250
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,074
PARIS:
That's closer.

251
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,327
I think his eyes
were wider apart.

252
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:32,079
Computer, increase the space
between the eyes

253
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,582
by three centimeters.

254
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:38,085
Increase skin color
and texture.

255
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,255
That's him.

256
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:44,050
Has anybody seen
this species before?

257
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,302
While you
were awake, I mean.

258
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,261
Seven?

259
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,765
He doesn't resemble any species
assimilated by the Borg.

260
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:53,434
PARIS:
So is he just a figment
of our imagination?

261
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,813
TORRES:
If he is, we've all been
imagining the exact same thing.

262
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,399
One possible explanation
is that he's attempting

263
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,775
to make telepathic contact.

264
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,569
He's doing more
than making contact.

265
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:05,238
We've got six crew members
who can't wake up.

266
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,657
For all we know,
it's some sort of attack.

267
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,075
From where?

268
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,202
Astrometric scans
haven't revealed any ships

269
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,871
in this vicinity

270
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:15,206
or planets capable of
sustaining humanoid life.

271
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:18,042
So where do we look?

272
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,670
In our dreams.

273
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,839
That's the only place
any of us have seen him, right?

274
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,674
So, if we want
to communicate with him--

275
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:25,842
find out what he wants--

276
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,218
we'll have to do it
on his terms.

277
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,637
How do you propose
we do that?

278
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,515
Lucid dreaming.

279
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:33,892
What's that?

280
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:36,644
It's a technique
which allows you to

281
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,896
take control of your dream.

282
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:39,272
That happened to me once.

283
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,148
I dreamt I was falling

284
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,401
and suddenly I realized
that I was dreaming

285
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,780
and I could fly, land...
do whatever I wanted.

286
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,489
I was in complete
control of the dream.

287
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,908
What happened
to you by accident

288
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,701
is something some people
can do by design.

289
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,953
I've been able
to have a lucid dream

290
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,414
by using the same technology
I use for a vision quest.

291
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,165
I may be able to use it

292
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,959
to communicate
with this alien.

293
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,711
Maybe so.

294
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,171
But how do we know you'd
be able to wake up again?

295
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,549
It's kind of like
self-hypnosis.

296
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,968
Before I go to sleep,
I choose a visual cue--

297
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,137
something to let me
know I'm dreaming--

298
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,305
Earth's moon, say.

299
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,056
Once I see it,
I can wake myself

300
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,142
by tapping the back
of my hand three times.

301
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,769
TUVOK:
Perhaps you are capable

302
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,020
of doing this under
normal circumstances,

303
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,231
but these were hardly
conventional dreams

304
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,190
we experienced.

305
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,734
I don't see
any other way

306
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,945
of finding out what our
friend here is after,

307
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:29,155
or how we can wake up
Harry and the others.

308
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,449
Besides, we can't
stay awake forever.

309
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,661
You'll do this in Sick Bay

310
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,120
under the doctor's
supervision.

311
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,872
The rest of you keep
scanning the region.

312
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,374
Analyze this ship
from stem to stern.

313
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:44,211
Wherever he is,
find him. Come on.

314
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,049
Normally, I consider
a good night's sleep

315
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,218
an important part
of any health regimen,

316
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,847
but in this case,
I can't recommend it.

317
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,890
I respect your
medical opinion, doctor.

318
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,767
But at this point,
we're out of options.

319
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,479
This will regulate
your hypothalamus.

320
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,939
But in all probability,

321
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,482
I won't be able to wake you.

322
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:05,692
You'll be on your own.

323
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,026
I understand.

324
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,030
Ready?

325
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,702
Pleasant dreams.

326
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,499
<i>Ah-koo-chee-moya.</i>

327
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:25,545
Far from the sacred places
of my grandfathers,

328
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,381
far from the bones of my people,

329
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,009
I seek to sleep,

330
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:34,094
to meet the one who has
visited us in our dreams.

331
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,005
(<i> door opens</i> )

332
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,550
(<i> door closes</i> )

333
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,160
(<i> door opens</i> )

334
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:06,813
I know this is a dream--
my dream.

335
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:07,855
I'm in control.

336
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:08,898
You're mistaken.

337
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,316
Am I?

338
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,734
This is more
than a dream.

339
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,069
It's my reality

340
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,946
and you're no different
than the others.

341
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:15,947
"The others?"

342
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:17,490
The waking species.

343
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,283
For centuries,
you've come and found us

344
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,994
in a state that
you call "sleep"

345
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:24,204
and tried to destroy us,
but not anymore.

346
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,624
Now<i> we</i> are in control.

347
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,542
One by one,
you will fall asleep

348
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,961
and enter our reality,

349
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:32,254
where it is you who
will be destroyed.

350
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,842
We didn't attack you.

351
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,343
We didn't even
know you existed

352
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,095
until we started seeing
you in our dreams.

353
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,347
Tell me how
I can wake my crew

354
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,474
and I promise we'll leave.

355
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,643
As long as you're asleep,
you're no threat to us.

356
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,228
I can wake myself
anytime I want,

357
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,982
and if I do...

358
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:52,483
I'm going to start
looking for you

359
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:53,943
in the waking world--

360
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,695
find where you're sleeping.

361
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,196
You wouldn't want that.

362
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,658
Leave our space.

363
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:03,410
Once you're beyond it,
your people will awaken.

364
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,038
Just tell me how
far we need to go.

365
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,748
There's a six-planet system
less than a parsec away.

366
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,292
It marks the nearest border
of our space.

367
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,545
We can be past
it in one day.

368
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,130
Then wake yourself...

369
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,925
and pray you never
dream of us again.

370
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,305
Congratulations,
Commander.

371
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,223
You're awake.

372
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,265
(<i> panting</i> )

373
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,934
Chakotay.

374
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,811
I'm fine.

375
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,105
The alien-- did you see him?

376
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,773
And?

377
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,859
Well, it was certainly
one of the most interesting

378
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,111
away missions
I've ever been on.

379
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:39,197
I'll tell you about it
on the way to the Bridge.

380
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,125
Tuvok, scan
for a six-planet system.

381
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,127
It should be less
than a parsec from here.

382
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,420
I have it, Captain,

383
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,756
at coordinates 139 mark 42.

384
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,383
Tom, lay in a course.

385
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,593
Aye, Captain.

386
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,678
Course laid in.

387
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,471
Do you mind if I ask
where we're heading?

388
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,306
Past the aliens' territory.

389
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,851
Once we're clear of it, Harry
and the others should wake up.

390
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,895
And the rest of us
can finally get some sleep.

391
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,022
One step at a time, Tom.

392
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,692
From what the alien told me,

393
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,402
it sounds like they
have corporeal form,

394
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,320
but they communicate
through their dreams.

395
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,322
For them, it's as real
as the waking world.

396
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,783
Extraordinary.

397
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,785
It reminds me
of the Australian Aborigines.

398
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,245
They believed the dream world

399
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:29,329
was no more or less real
than the waking world.

400
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,498
In fact,
their creation mythology says

401
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,710
their ancestors actually dreamed
the universe into existence.

402
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,878
That's mythology.

403
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,880
This seems to be fact.

404
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,841
I wonder...

405
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,093
do they ever wake up?

406
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:43,928
How did they evolve this way?

407
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,512
We may never know.

408
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:48,557
Sometimes first contact
is last contact.

409
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:01,528
We're approaching the border
of the aliens' space.

410
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,656
Commander Tuvok,
inform the doctor.

411
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,741
TUVOK:
Aye, Captain.

412
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,997
Wake up, Ensign.

413
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,500
(<i> groaning softly</i> )

414
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,002
What's going on?

415
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:17,086
You were napping.

416
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,464
In Sick Bay?

417
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,633
We had to move you here
when we couldn't wake you.

418
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,428
Whew.

419
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,513
How long?

420
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:28,722
17 hours.

421
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,599
I take it you
experienced nightmares

422
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,185
like the rest
of the crew.

423
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,228
Oh, I had nightmares, all right.

424
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,147
Tell me about them.

425
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:37,690
Well...

426
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,443
I was, uh, in the corridor...

427
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,863
(<i> door opens</i> )

428
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,948
Captain Janeway asked me
to bring you the results

429
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,158
of our astrometric scans.

430
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,909
She thought
they might be helpful

431
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,495
in determining the precise cause
of the crew's somnolence.

432
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,746
Thank you.

433
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,414
Ensign Kim,
now that you're awake,

434
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,792
I require your assistance
in Jefferies Tube 21-Beta.

435
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,921
Is something wrong?

436
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:04,382
No. I, um...

437
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,677
I'm still feeling
a little groggy.

438
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:08,804
Then, I'll wait
until you are fully recovered.

439
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:11,765
Now, then, Ensign,

440
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,851
you were telling me
about your nightmare.

441
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:17,897
You know what, doc? Um...

442
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:24,570
I'm... famished.

443
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,072
(<i> clearing throat</i> )

444
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:28,324
Haven't eaten
in at least 17 hours, right?

445
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,201
Very well.

446
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:31,660
Go eat, get some clothes on,

447
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,246
and report back in an hour.

448
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,206
I'll see you later.

449
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:36,249
You too, Seven.

450
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:40,627
And the next thing I knew,

451
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,129
I was being boiled alive

452
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,673
in a pot of my
own<i> leola</i> root stew.

453
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,550
Talk about a nightmare.

454
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,386
Well, it was
perfectly seasoned.

455
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:49,553
(<i> door opens</i> )

456
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:55,684
Well, if it isn't
Sleeping Beauty.

457
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,270
I do look well-rested, don't I?

458
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,854
NEELIX:
Is everyone
awake now?

459
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,357
The doc checked us all out
and says we're fine.

460
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:02,566
Have a seat.

461
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,152
We were just trading
dream stories.

462
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,237
Tell us yours.

463
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:08,197
Oh. It was...

464
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:09,656
nothing very interesting.

465
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,533
Just the usual...

466
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,952
You know, uh...

467
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,328
Who was she, Harry?

468
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,250
The woman of my dreams.

469
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,086
(<i> cracking up</i> )

470
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:26,673
What I'd like to know
is what Tuvok dreamt about.

471
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,259
Yes, Commander, tell us.

472
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:30,261
What do Vulcans dream?

473
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,554
Aren't you supposed
to have horrible nightmares?

474
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,766
I wonder what a Vulcan
nightmare would be like?

475
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:39,061
NEELIX:
Alone, exiled
on a planet

476
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,939
where the only form
of communication...

477
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:43,441
is laughter.

478
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:45,901
(<i> all laughing</i> )

479
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,361
Oh, come on, Tuvok.

480
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:51,324
I won't dignify this inquisition
with a response.

481
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:54,410
JANEWAY:
<i>Red Alert.</i>

482
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,829
<i>All hands to battle stations.</i>

483
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,872
They're coming around
for another pass.

484
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,666
Auxiliary power to the shields.

485
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,421
Return fire.

486
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:10,134
CHAKOTAY:
No damage to the alien ship.

487
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,136
Our phasers can't penetrate
their shields.

488
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:13,846
Arm photon torpedoes.

489
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:18,767
We seem to have a knack for
provoking strangers these days.

490
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:19,935
Shields are off-line.

491
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,020
Fire.

492
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,441
I've lost power
to the torpedo launchers.

493
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:26,817
What's happening?

494
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:29,695
Power is being drained
from all systems.

495
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,071
We're being hailed.

496
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,032
On screen.

497
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,116
<i>Captain.</i>

498
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,201
<i>Ensign Kim.</i>

499
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:36,702
<i>Commander Chakotay.</i>

500
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:40,831
<i>I'm glad to see you</i>
<i>all up and about.</i>

501
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,713
Janeway to Engineering.

502
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,383
We need auxiliary power
to the engines now.

503
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:52,218
<i>I think you'll find</i>
<i>that impossible.</i>

504
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:54,552
B'Elanna, report.
TORRES:<i> There's a localized</i> 

505
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,263
dampening field
around the ship, Captain.

506
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:59,058
<i>I can't give you engines,</i>
<i>weapons, shields...</i>

507
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,893
Everything you told me
was a lie.

508
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,396
This was all an elaborate trap
to get<i> Voyager</i> here.

509
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:07,483
<i>It appears you're learning</i>
<i>more about my people after all.</i>

510
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:09,943
<i>Prepare to surrender your ship.</i>

511
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:13,322
Captain, three more
alien vessels are approaching.

512
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:15,241
They are powering weapons.

513
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:18,576
You've gone to so much trouble
to commandeer this ship.

514
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:21,121
I don't think
you're going to destroy it.

515
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,748
<i>I won't need to.</i>

516
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,588
Janeway to the crew.
We're under attack.

517
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:33,092
Implement defense
procedure omega.

518
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,343
It's no use.

519
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:35,761
We've taken every deck.

520
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,013
The ship is ours.

521
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:54,905
Captain.

522
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,914
All the time I thought
I was negotiating,

523
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:06,208
they were just setting us up
to fly right into their web.

524
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,834
You couldn't have
known it was a trick.

525
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:11,046
I don't understand. They exist
in dreams and reality?

526
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,381
Apparently, entering our dreams

527
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,049
was their way
to learn about us...

528
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,801
perhaps to probe our weaknesses.

529
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,761
Not to mention lure
us into an ambush.

530
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,221
We need to retake the ship.

531
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:21,014
That means getting
out of this cargo bay.

532
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,142
I checked the Jefferies tubes.
They're sealed.

533
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,810
Maybe we can open them manually.

534
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,103
That's not going to be easy.

535
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:27,354
They've got people everywhere.

536
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,398
We'll have
to create a diversion.

537
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:33,486
Any ideas?
I have one, Captain.

538
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:34,652
(<i> grunts</i> )

539
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,532
What the hell are you doing?!

540
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:40,618
(<i> speaking softly</i> ):
Creating a diversion.

541
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:42,328
Ensign Kim,

542
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:45,289
it is your fault
we have been captured.

543
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,084
I suggest you fight back.

544
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,503
(<i> grunting</i> )

545
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,007
Tom...

546
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,674
try to get into
a Jefferies tube.

547
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,385
You two work on
the power grid.

548
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,887
I'll deal with this.

549
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:03,098
ALIEN: Stop, stop!
JANEWAY: What's going on here?

550
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,058
These are my people.
I'll handle them.

551
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,435
Ensign, that's enough.
Move!

552
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:26,580
What's wrong?

553
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,789
I'm still asleep.

554
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,875
What are you talking about?

555
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:33,379
Chakotay!

556
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,555
(<i> alarmed gasp</i> )

557
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:45,265
Commander Chakotay,
you're awake.

558
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,684
Am I?

559
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:48,268
Are you sure?

560
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,311
Of course you are.

561
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:57,110
What are you
looking for?

562
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,111
The moon.

563
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,154
What?

564
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,035
I don't see it.

565
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:08,955
Where's the Captain?

566
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,290
Asleep--

567
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,709
along with the rest of the crew.

568
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:12,710
All of them?

569
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,711
Except me.

570
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:15,254
No rest for the never-weary.

571
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,547
What happened?

572
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:18,965
As soon as you entered
your lucid dream,

573
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,800
they all began falling
asleep one by one.

574
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,387
I've been trying every method
I can think of to revive them,

575
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:24,388
but nothing works.

576
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:26,306
It's been 39 hours.

577
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,058
I've been asleep
for almost two days?

578
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:29,851
If I can't
wake them soon,

579
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,187
I'm going to have to start
feeding them intravenously.

580
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:35,148
They let me think I was awake,
but I was still dreaming.

581
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,442
You weren't
the only one.

582
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,318
Look at this.

583
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,903
What is it?

584
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,863
A neurogenic field
created by heightened

585
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,449
electrical activity
in the brain.

586
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:45,033
It's been occurring in all

587
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,994
the sleeping crew members--
and that's not all.

588
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:51,081
This is Ensign Kim's
brain wave pattern, indicating

589
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:53,542
that he's dreaming
in a hyper-REM state.

590
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:56,670
This is Crewman
Foster's pattern.

591
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,297
They're identical.

592
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,132
Lieutenant Torres,

593
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:03,469
Captain Janeway,
Commander Tuvok...

594
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:05,887
I don't know what it means.

595
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,848
I think I do.

596
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:12,060
Not only are they dreaming,

597
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,396
they're all having
the same dream.

598
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,528
It wasn't just my dream.
It was a communal dream.

599
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,280
Everyone's REM patterns
are identical.

600
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,990
They're experiencing
the same images,

601
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,825
each from his or her
own point of view.

602
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,243
Yes. I saw the rest
of the crew--

603
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,953
interacted with them.

604
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,956
We were all working together
to fight off an alien attack.

605
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,124
Which wasn't real.

606
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:35,709
Oh, we're under attack,
all right.

607
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,252
Commander?

608
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,546
Maybe this is the way these
aliens fight their enemies.

609
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:43,008
They exist somewhere in
our reality as physical beings,

610
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:46,553
but they must be asleep,
unable to defend themselves

611
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,806
against what they call
"waking species."

612
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:50,849
We'll never defeat them
in their dream reality,

613
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,185
but if we can find them,
find where they're sleeping,

614
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,812
we'll have the advantage.

615
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:57,314
But we've been scanning for
life-forms since this started

616
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:58,691
and we haven't found anything.

617
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:00,984
Maybe we've been looking
in the wrong place.

618
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,903
I'm betting a species that
spends its time sleeping

619
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,280
isn't going to be hanging around

620
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,407
where conventional scans
can locate them.

621
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,701
So, how do we find them?

622
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:10,744
This neurogenic
field you mentioned--

623
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:13,706
anyone in a hyper-REM state
would be producing one.

624
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:15,833
In theory, yes.

625
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:17,959
So if we scan
for other neurogenic fields,

626
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,712
it might lead us
to the sleeping aliens.

627
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:21,839
If you need me,
I'll be on the Bridge.

628
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,143
Time for a little energy boost,
Commander.

629
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,978
We don't want you drifting
back to sleep.

630
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,897
Sorry about the mess,

631
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,024
but this is what happens
when my repeated requests

632
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,360
for a larger Sick Bay
fall on deaf ears.

633
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,612
(<i> console beeping</i> )

634
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,535
What is it?

635
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:53,871
Scanners have detected
a neurogenic field

636
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:55,873
emanating from
beneath the surface of a planet

637
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:57,957
less than a light-year
from here.

638
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:01,294
Excuse me, Tom, but I've
got to change our course.

639
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,178
Still dreaming?

640
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,055
How is that possible?

641
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,891
I don't know, but that's
what Chakotay said

642
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:16,309
right before he vanished.
That doesn't make any sense.

643
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,562
He was wide awake
right here with us.

644
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,647
He said something
about still being asleep

645
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,858
and then he started tapping
the back of his hand

646
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,984
like he said he would
to wake up from his lucid dream.

647
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,195
(<i> softly</i> ):
And then he disappeared.

648
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:31,867
The question is,
where did he go?

649
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,745
The aliens must
have transported him somewhere.

650
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:36,413
Or perhaps he did wake up.

651
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:37,748
Tuvok?

652
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:41,209
It's possible he was dreaming
all of this.

653
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,754
Wait a minute.

654
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:46,590
If Chakotay was dreaming
and he woke up,

655
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,341
what are we doing here?

656
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,677
Perhaps we are dreaming
as well.

657
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,596
Now I'm lost.

658
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,139
You're not the only one.

659
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:56,725
Consider that we all
experienced nightmares

660
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,435
about an alien whose people

661
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:01,020
apparently live out their lives
in a dream state.

662
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,273
Perhaps we are in that state

663
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:05,150
this very moment.
That's ridiculous.

664
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,235
We're not asleep.
Wait.

665
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,155
When you dream, you're rarely
aware that you're sleeping.

666
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:12,324
I can understand
how we could mistake dreaming

667
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:15,034
for reality,
but that doesn't explain

668
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:17,120
how we're all interacting
with one another.

669
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,622
Maybe we're not.

670
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:19,748
Not what?

671
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,667
Interacting
with one another.

672
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:24,711
Maybe this is all
one person's dream--

673
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,380
if, for example, mine--
and none of you are really here.

674
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,925
Trust me, Neelix,
I wish I weren't, but I'm here.

675
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,677
Collective unconsciousness.

676
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:34,387
Seven, come here.

677
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:39,309
The Borg share
a collective consciousness.

678
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:40,978
These aliens
may have somehow induced

679
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:43,104
a state
of collective<i> unconsciousness.</i>

680
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:47,567
You mean... we're all
sharing the same dream?

681
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,194
TUVOK:
It is possible.

682
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:52,030
This is all
fascinating speculation,

683
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,157
but unless we have proof
to the contrary,

684
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,117
we have to treat this
like an invasion.

685
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,286
I managed to open
a Jefferies tube hatch.

686
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,496
Good work.

687
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,080
Neelix, Seven, Kim,

688
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,666
do what you can
to distract the guards.

689
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,668
We're going to find a way
to retake the ship.

690
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:14,928
Looks like a complete
power drain.

691
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:17,389
Their dampening field
has shut down the warp core.

692
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,849
Which begs the question

693
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:20,809
of what they intend to do
with an unpowered ship.

694
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:24,980
Tuvok, grab some phaser rifles
from the weapons locker.

695
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,649
Something tells me when we try
to disable the dampening field,

696
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,401
we're going to get
the aliens' attention.

697
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:32,988
It looks like they're using
harmonic inversion technology.

698
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:35,866
If I can isolate
the containment frequency,

699
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:38,076
I may be able to get
main power back on line.

700
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,828
(<i> equipment powering up</i> )

701
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,000
That was easy.

702
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,502
COMPUTER:
<i>Warning. Warp core breach</i>
<i>in 60 seconds.</i>

703
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,754
Maybe a little too easy.

704
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:49,755
I don't understand.

705
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:50,923
Can you eject the core?

706
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:52,632
I'm trying.

707
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,175
It's not working.

708
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,511
<i>Warp core breach in 50 seconds.</i>

709
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,597
(<i> whooshing</i> )

710
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,057
We've got to get
out of here.

711
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:01,725
I'm trying
to put a containment field

712
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:02,768
around Engineering.

713
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:05,103
<i>Warp core breach in 40 seconds.</i>

714
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,356
Got it! Let's move!

715
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:11,401
I don't understand why you
couldn't eject the core!

716
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,528
<i>Warp core breach in 30 seconds.</i>

717
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,948
Something's not right.

718
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,323
Captain, we must hurry!

719
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,324
I'm going back in there.

720
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,367
You'll be killed!

721
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,744
<i>Warp core breach...</i>

722
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,454
I think I'm onto something.
You two go!

723
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,706
Captain!
That's an order!

724
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:27,876
<i>Warp core breach</i>
<i>in ten seconds.</i>

725
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:31,463
<i>Nine, eight, seven, six...</i>

726
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:32,714
(<i> grunts</i> )

727
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:37,218
<i>five, four, three, two, one.</i>

728
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,596
(<i> explosion</i> )

729
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:40,931
(<i> breathing heavily</i> )

730
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:52,275
Either I've become impervious
to antimatter explosions...

731
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,402
or we're still dreaming.

732
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:03,411
A warp core explosion
should have destroyed the ship.

733
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,330
If I were awake,
or if any of this were real,

734
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,832
which it obviously isn't.

735
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:08,500
Things just weren't adding up--

736
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,378
Chakotay's disappearance,
the warp core failing to eject.

737
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,964
And as Chakotay said,

738
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:17,216
"lucid dreaming
is about taking control"

739
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,760
so I... took a chance.

740
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,013
Surely, there must have been
a less extreme method

741
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:22,722
of testing your assumptions.

742
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:25,851
As Captain, you shouldn't be
taking chances with your life.

743
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:27,769
I'm touched
by your concern, Tuvok.

744
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:30,647
Now that we know
this is a dream...

745
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:32,691
what do we do?

746
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,318
I suggest we find a way
to regain consciousness.

747
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,660
Captain, how did
you wake yourself?

748
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,745
The same way you did.
The others?

749
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,497
They should all be
starting to wake up.

750
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:49,875
Rise and shine, Mr. Paris.

751
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,585
We need to get as far away
from their planet as possible.

752
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,962
Agreed.

753
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:56,006
I'll make the necessary
course correction.

754
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,760
What is it?

755
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,931
This isn't real.

756
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,683
Of course it is.

757
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,394
See?

758
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:10,937
No.

759
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:17,777
Doctor?

760
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,487
He's paranoid--
disoriented.

761
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,031
I suspect much
of the crew

762
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:24,325
will suffer similar
symptoms when<i> they</i> awake.

763
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:27,537
DOCTOR:
Try to relax, Commander.
I'm going to sedate you.

764
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,581
No! I need to wake up,
not sleep!

765
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:30,874
I'm here to help you.

766
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:32,792
No!

767
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,462
It's all right, Commander.

768
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:37,756
You're awake again.

769
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,553
What happened?

770
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:44,971
You dozed off.

771
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,973
I couldn't wake myself
like I did before.

772
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,683
Our proximity
to the neurogenic field

773
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,685
is making it more difficult
to stay conscious.

774
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,021
I need to get down there and
find a way to neutralize it.

775
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,397
Not so fast.

776
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:57,025
This is a highly potent
animazine derivative.

777
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,945
If you feel yourself falling
asleep again, you must use it.

778
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:03,073
And, Commander, I suggest
we keep an open com line.

779
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:05,033
I may need to provide you
with a verbal splash

780
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,910
of cold water
every now and then.

781
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,210
It's not working.

782
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,212
It's safe to assume that
Chakotay and the doctor

783
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:19,297
are making every effort
to wake us from our sleep.

784
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,716
We have to let the rest of
the crew know what's happening--

785
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,635
that as long as they know
they're in a dream,

786
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:24,886
they can't be harmed.

787
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:26,679
And if the aliens
try to stop us?

788
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,890
Then we turn this dreamworld
of theirs...

789
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,017
into a nightmare.

790
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:47,075
Okay, doctor...

791
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,367
I'm in.

792
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,995
<i>Acknowledged, Commander.</i>

793
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,115
Stand aside.

794
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,701
Your weapons are useless
against us.

795
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,328
You're not fooling anyone.

796
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,954
We know this is a dream.

797
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:34,831
You're confused.

798
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:38,335
Actually, I'm finally
seeing things clearly.

799
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:40,253
Shoot them.

800
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,800
Now, stand aside.

801
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:53,892
All of you, listen closely.

802
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:54,976
What we have to do

803
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:56,936
is stay in control
of the dream.

804
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,064
If we can do that,

805
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:01,191
the aliens shouldn't
be able to hurt us.

806
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:07,197
You sound very sure
of yourself, Captain.

807
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:10,033
Why shouldn't I be?

808
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,826
Have you thought
about what's happening

809
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,328
to your bodies
in the waking world?

810
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,621
How long do you think
they'll survive

811
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:17,207
without nourishment?

812
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:18,541
Without physical activity?

813
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:22,670
Your bodies are withering
away as we speak.

814
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,589
You can't stop it.

815
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,883
Don't be so sure.

816
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:29,386
It's some kind of transmitter.

817
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:30,929
It looks like they
use it to amplify

818
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,555
<i>the neurogenic field.</i>

819
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,973
Can you turn it off?

820
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,059
I tried knocking it out
with my phaser,

821
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:37,852
but there's some kind
of force field.

822
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:42,857
Commander?

823
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,401
I'm sorry.

824
00:40:44,401 --> 00:40:46,069
I'm having trouble
concentrating.

825
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:47,946
Time for your medicine.

826
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:02,085
Doctor, this animazine--
it's pretty powerful.

827
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:04,712
Yes. And I suggest
you take it immediately.

828
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,257
These aliens...

829
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:09,968
they look pretty frail.

830
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:13,138
That's fascinating, Commander.
Now please inject yourself.

831
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,767
They probably wouldn't have
the same tolerance

832
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,060
for stimulants that we do.

833
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,812
<i>What are you getting at?</i>

834
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,439
The animazine might be capable

835
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:24,023
of waking up
one of these aliens.

836
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,608
Commander, I'd be
happy to discuss

837
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,068
comparative pharmacology
with you

838
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:29,695
after you administer
your injection.

839
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:32,282
Actually... I think
I'm going to give it

840
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:33,950
to one
of my sleepy friends here.

841
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,952
What would that accomplish?

842
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:37,703
<i>If I can wake him up,</i>

843
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:40,832
I might be able to get him
to deactivate this generator.

844
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,792
There's not enough animazine
for two doses.

845
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:45,170
If you fall asleep again,
there's no way I can revive you.

846
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,587
(<i> sighing</i> )

847
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,923
Doctor, I want you
to go to the Bridge.

848
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,467
Commander...

849
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:52,093
<i>I'm giving you an order!</i>

850
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,928
Go to the Bridge
and target my com signal

851
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:54,971
with a photon torpedo.

852
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,139
You're delirious.

853
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:57,932
You're asking me
to incinerate you.

854
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,434
Not just me...

855
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:02,520
these aliens...

856
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,481
and their transmitter, too.

857
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:05,815
But only if you
don't hear from me

858
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:07,317
<i>in five minutes.</i>
<i>Understood?</i>

859
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:08,567
Commander...

860
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,028
Understood?!

861
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:13,239
Aye, sir.

862
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:29,506
Tell me how to deactivate
this transmitter, or I shoot.

863
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:30,882
What happened?

864
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:33,385
Looks like he woke up.

865
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:36,971
I'll give you five seconds.

866
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:40,016
Four...

867
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:41,100
three...

868
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,810
two...

869
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:47,524
Chakotay.

870
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:53,530
Who's going to help
you now, Captain?

871
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:56,449
I found the cavern
and your people.

872
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:58,659
I'm there right now
in the waking world.

873
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,286
And it's all going
to be destroyed

874
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,538
in less than two minutes

875
00:43:01,538 --> 00:43:03,664
unless you deactivate
that transmitter.

876
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:07,668
If you are there,
you'll be killed, too.

877
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,754
I think you're lying.

878
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:12,382
Oh, believe me,
if I don't contact my ship,

879
00:43:12,382 --> 00:43:15,134
you and I are both
going to die in our sleep.

880
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:25,978
<i>Chief Medical Officer's Log,</i>

Sorry, Commander.

I didn't mean

890

You're not starting breakfast
this early, are you?

891
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,731
Just rearranging
the supply cabinets.

892
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,650

00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:17,738
Sounds good.

896
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,074
I know it's silly,

897
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:22,994
but every time I'm
about to doze off,

898
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:24,245
I... become terrified

899
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:26,247
that I won't be able
to wake again.

900
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:27,873
(<i> door opens</i> )

901
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,875
You, too?

902
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:32,044
We just finished a little
late-night hoverball

903
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,045
on the holodeck.

904
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,589
Three games in a row.

905
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:36,048
We were hoping
it would wear us out.

906
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,217
You know, I could
learn to enjoy

907
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,094
these late-night
get-togethers.

908
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,305
Speak for yourself.

909
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:44,390
I would kill for
a good night's sleep.

910
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,481
Neelix, I think it's
time for breakfast.

911
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:54,275
(<i> all chuckling</i> )
