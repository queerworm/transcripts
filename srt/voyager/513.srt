1
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,033
VULCAN MASTER:
The<i> Kol-Ut-Shan...</i>

2
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,912
a cornerstone of our beliefs.

3
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:40,290
Infinite diversity
in infinite combinations.

4
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,627
I know all about
Vulcan philosophies.

5
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,379
Why have you
come here?

6
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,089
I was sent
against my will.

7
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:51,134
Then I suggest
you leave.

8
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,845
I'm not a prisoner?

9
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:57,391
Only of your emotions,
or so I have been told.

10
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,935
My emotions free me.

11
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,937
I see.

12
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:05,983
It's regrettable that I
won't be able to teach you.

13
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:08,068
Where should I go?

14
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,863
Are you seeking
my counsel?

15
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:14,700
I...can't return home.

16
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,994
My father has banished me.

17
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,579
Your school?

18
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,997
They revoked my seat.

19
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,041
Why?

20
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:24,877
Because I refuse
to deny myself passion,

21
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:28,505
the way you
and men like my father do.

22
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,340
You reject logic?

23
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,426
If I was meant
to deny feelings,

24
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,386
why was I born with them?

25
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,055
Where's the logic in that?

26
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:40,517
Hidden for you to find...

27
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:44,438
or in plain sight
for you to ignore.

28
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,815
You speak in riddles
because the truth frightens you.

29
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,025
You're right.

30
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,735
It does
frighten me.

31
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:52,029
You are surprised

32
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:56,075
to hear a Vulcan master
admit to having emotions?

33
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:57,325
Yes.

34
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,495
Emotions can be
a powerful tool.

35
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,415
To deny their existence
is illogical,

36
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:06,961
but you must learn
to control them.

37
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,796
Why?

38
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:12,424
Do you wish to be taught?

39
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,722
I would question
everything you say.

40
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:23,518
You would not be
a worthy pupil otherwise.

41
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,479
Let us begin.

42
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,732
Sit down, Tuvok.

43
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:33,487
( mellow theme plays )

44
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,911
( soft, whirring beeps )

45
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,959
( grunting )

46
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,925
( rumbling )

47
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,097
( distant crash )

48
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:52,162
<i>Tun beveg!</i>

49
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,412
PARIS:
Uh, sorry?

50
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:56,708
<i>Senn...nebah senn?</i>

51
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:00,295
Either the universal
translator's offline,

52
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,214
or I hit my head
harder than I thought.

53
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:03,548
<i>Ruck.</i>

54
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,799
All right.

55
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,551
Take it easy.

56
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,303
All right, all right.

57
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,554
Take it easy.

58
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,805
<i>Fitah!</i>

59
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:14,142
This?

60
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,852
Listen, I really need this.

61
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,187
<i>Fitah! Ud neetot!</i>

62
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,022
Okay, okay.

63
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,453
( sighs )

64
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,502
First day in town
and I've already been mugged.

65
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:14,577
Ah.

66
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,498
( grunts )

67
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,167
( yells )

68
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,384
( yells, groans )

69
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:40,937
( grunting )

70
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,563
( groans )

71
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:57,996
I'm Commander Tuvok
of the Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

72
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,377
Tuvok.

73
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:06,171
Tuvok.

74
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,631
Yes.

75
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,966
And you?

76
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:14,679
Noss.
Noss.

77
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,736
We'll go to my vessel.

78
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,662
I see you've already been there.

79
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,166
Mayday, Mayday.

80
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,211
Paris to<i> Voyager.</i>
Respond.

81
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,547
Aw, come on.

82
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,215
( clattering )

83
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,677
Her name is Noss.

84
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:58,014
She was attacked
by two humanoid males.

85
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,141
You sure she didn't attack them?

86
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,018
They were attempting
to rob her.

87
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,896
Seems to be a
local pastime.

88
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,249
She requires medical attention.

89
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,251
PARIS:
I'd love to help,

90
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,296
but somebody stole our medkits.

91
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,472
Food.

92
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,935
What's the status
of the shuttle?

93
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,937
Fractures
throughout the hull,

94
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,981
environmental
systems down,

95
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,900
impulse engines
are beyond repair.

96
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,861
Told you we should have
brought the<i> Delta Flyer.</i>

97
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,782
Communications appear
to be functional.

98
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,700
Won't do us any good.

99
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,369
Every time
I transmit a signal,

100
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,704
it gets bounced back
by the distortion field

101
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,290
that pulled us down here.

102
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,837
It looks like we fell into
some kind of gravity well.

103
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,589
As far as I can tell,

104
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,383
this planet is a part
of an entire solar system

105
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,718
that is stuck in
a pocket of subspace.

106
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:18,970
Fascinating.

107
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,306
( scoffs )
Yeah.

108
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:22,765
Well, scientific
interest aside,

109
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,309
I don't see any
easy way out of here.

110
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,684
TUVOK:
No doubt<i> Voyager</i>

111
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:26,936
has begun a rescue effort.

112
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,396
The Doctor?

113
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,524
His mobile emitter was
damaged during the crash.

114
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:31,941
With a little luck,
I might be able

115
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,652
to repair it and bring
him back online.

116
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:35,820
TUVOK:
Make it your
top priority.

117
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,447
<i>Gren, gren.</i>

118
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,157
What is it?

119
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,701
Thirteen humanoids
approaching,

120
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:45,121
the same species
that attacked her.

121
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,040
Gather as many supplies
as you can carry.

122
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,583
We're leaving.

123
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,835
You really think it's smart
to abandon the shuttle?

124
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,213
Noss appears to have
survived here for some time.

125
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,841
It's logical to assume she has
access to a more secure shelter.

126
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,843
<i>Nemmok. Eilen.</i>

127
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,387
<i>Eilen.</i>

128
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,972
Whatever you say.

129
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,751
<i>Eid kahn.</i>

130
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,916
Doesn't look like this
bird's gonna fly either.

131
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,210
Minimal power
and life support,

132
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,380
but the ship is protected
by a force field.

133
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,675
That explains how she's
been able to survive here.

134
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,677
Anything resembling
an engine?

135
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,220
I'm detecting
engine debris...

136
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,639
two kilometers away.

137
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,766
It is of the same
configuration as this vessel.

138
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:29,016
Great.

139
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,477
We've got two unusable ships,

140
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,395
and the only way<i> Voyager</i>
is going to detect

141
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:36,899
our distress call is if they
crash land right on top of us.

142
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,652
Progress?

143
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:42,572
The optronic relays
took heavy damage.

144
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:46,451
I'm bypassing
the primary circuits.

145
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,868
Come on, Doc.

146
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,664
I know you're in there.

147
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,627
I'm guessing
we hit a snag.

148
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:57,128
An accurate assumption.

149
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,257
<i>Rev din ud?</i>

150
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,468

<i>Ton rev ud tim seid.</i>

153
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,057
You speak her language?

154
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:14,061
A universal translator
was written into my program.

155
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,189
Ask her how long
she's been here,

156
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,942
if she knows a way to get
back through that sinkhole.

157
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:23,780
<i>Din yee ton ud lurka?</i>

158
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:27,367

<i>Mah'ees bin ruck ayah.</i>

163
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,838
What'd she say?

164
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:44,384
She said she's been
here 14 seasons,

165
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,554
and in that time, she's seen
many ships come down,

166
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,014
but she's never seen one
go back up again.

167
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,031
( soft, whirring beeps )

168
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,955
( grunting )

169
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,920
Come back,
you little bloodsucker.

170
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,088
( laughing )

171
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,506
I don't know
what's worse,

172
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,132
catching them
or eating them.

173
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,551
No poison.

174
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,261
Well, they may not
be poisonous,

175
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,263
but they give
me the creeps.

176
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,682
Maybe I should have
left the hunting

177
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:33,974
to you and Tuvok.

178
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,309
Let me.

179
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,824
( yells )

180
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:54,537
Looks delicious.

181
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,671
Shut down my program?

182
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,881
Why?

183
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,507
Our resources are
severely limited.

184
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,884
We may need your
mobile emitter

185
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,135
as a source of power.

186
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,595
I'm a Doctor,
not a battery.

187
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:11,805
Until we're rescued,

188
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,473
or you're needed
for an emergency,

189
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,683
I must insist that
you remain offline.

190
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,394
Make way for the
mighty hunters.

191
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:22,607
If Mr. Paris' hunting
ability is any indication,

192
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,275
maybe we should
take him offline.

193
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,861
Thanks for the vote
of confidence, Doc.

194
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,446
The hunt was good.

195
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,366
Impressive.

196
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:36,120
<i>Voyager</i> has 15 decks,

197
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,538
a crew of 152,

198
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,166
warp and impulse engines.

199
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,877
I want to see.

200
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,629
Someday, perhaps.

201
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,008
Tell me about
you there.

202
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,344
I am the Chief
Tactical Officer.

203
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,098
What else?

204
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,893
Can you be
more specific?

205
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,980
Your duties, uh...

206
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,651
Where you sleep?
What you eat?

207
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,277
Music?

208
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,696
Friends?

209
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,948
Why is any
of that relevant?

210
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,743
Because it is you.

211
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,665
When I first met her,

212
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,834
she wouldn't
even look at me,

213
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:26,045
but she warmed up after,
oh...three years.

214
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,882
The longest flirtation
in Starfleet history.

215
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,091
( chuckling ):
No kidding.

216
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:34,637
She sounds...
fascinating.

217
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,973
I just hope
I see her again.

218
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,809
You must really...

219
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,980
<i>bot yah jouton.</i>

220
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,525
Love her very much.

221
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,863
Yeah.

222
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,620
More spiders?

223
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,958
Oh no, thank you.
Three's my limit.

224
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,334
I will assist you.

225
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:13,175
Well, I suppose it's time
I shut down my program.

226
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,762
Good night, Doc.

227
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,739
She likes you.

228
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,366
She has been alone
for many years.

229
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,368
She appreciates
our company.

230
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,499
No. I mean...
she likes you.

231
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,628
What are you implying?

232
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,921
Oh come on, Tuvok.

233
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,506
You may be cold,
but you're not blind.

234
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,676
Need I remind you
that I am married?

235
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,178
Your wife is 50,000 light-years
away,

236
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,056
in a different
layer of space.

237
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,141
The chances of you ever
seeing her again

238
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,643
are practically
nonexistent.

239
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,396
Excuse me.

240
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,745
What are
you doing?

241
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:25,832
I'm recalibrating
the distress beacon.

242
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,250
Listen, um...

243
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,212
what I said in there...
about your wife...

244
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,547
I'm sorry.

245
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,842
I didn't mean to
hurt your feelings.

246
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,927
I have no feelings
for you to hurt.

247
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:41,973
I think you do.

248
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:44,600
You work hard
to bury them,

249
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,435
but they're there.

250
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,440
And even if
they're not...

251
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,652
this is home now.

252
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,112
You might as well
accept it,

253
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:59,032
and try to find as much
happiness as you can.

254
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,910
Listen, you have a chance
to make a decent life

255
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,496
for yourself here.

256
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,040
There is still
a possibility

257
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,916
that<i> Voyager</i>
will rescue us.

258
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,210
You may see Lieutenant
Torres again.

259
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,212
If I didn't
know you better,

260
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:17,133
I'd say you were trying
to cheer me up, Tuvok.

261
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,552
Is there a point
to your pessimism?

262
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,803
It's not pessimism.

263
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,138
It's practicality.

264
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,682
You of all people
should understand that.

265
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:28,686
Look, I've never
met your wife,

266
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:31,064
but if she's half
as logical as you are,

267
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:33,900
I bet you she'd tell
you the same thing.

268
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,155
Your attempt to play
matchmaker is misguided.

269
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,199
I am not experiencing
<i>Pon farr.</i>

270
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:42,783
What difference
does it make?

271
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,618
You obviously
care about Noss.

272
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,079
If you won't
admit it to me,

273
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,039
at least admit it
to yourself.

274
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:51,792
I respect her ability
to survive.

275
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,460
It's more than that.

276
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,172
I've seen the way
you look at her.

277
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,506
What way is that?

278
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,220
Like someone who wishes
he wasn't Vulcan.

279
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,232
I'm sorry I was born Vulcan.

280
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:16,316
<i>B'Elak paar.</i>

281
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,652
Self pity.

282
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,321
Are you cataloging
my emotions?

283
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,032
What is the source
of your self pity?

284
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,408
Isn't it obvious?

285
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,827
If I weren't Vulcan,
I wouldn't be here now,

286
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,955
going through
this pointless ritual.

287
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:31,916
You see only what
is in front of you.

288
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,501
You must learn
to see behind you.

289
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,669
Another riddle.

290
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,131
I have no eyes
to see behind me.

291
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,216
You have
the eyes of memory,

292
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,509
the knowledge
of why you are here,

293
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,012
and why you have
lost control.

294
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,228
Tell me your story.

295
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,272
My father's
already explained it.

296
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:56,690
I wish to hear it from you.

297
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,362
Her name is Jara.

298
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:05,324
Her father's
a Terrelian diplomat.

299
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,327
She's been granted
a seat at my school.

300
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,745
And you have developed...

301
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,331
an emotional attraction
toward her.

302
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,083
Yes.

303
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,293
You love her.

304
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:16,710
Yes.

305
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,671
Does she
love you?

306
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,842
No. She's...

307
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:29,347
Jara...doesn't return
my feelings.

308
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:31,349
What if I were
to say

309
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,351
that I received
a letter

310
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:35,938
from your father telling me

311
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,523
that Jara is in love

312
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,817
with one of your
fellow students?

313
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,152
That's a lie!

314
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,737
Who is it?

315
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,363
Jealousy?

316
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,158
I'll challenge him.

317
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,202
That would be illogical,

318
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,912
because I have received
no such letter.

319
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,625
You're trying to trick me.

320
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:00,378
No. I'm trying to help
you to understand.

321
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:02,422
<i>Shon-ha'lock,</i> love,

322
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:05,592
is the most dangerous
emotion of all.

323
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:08,386
It produces
many other emotions,

324
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:13,100
jealousy, shame,
rage, grief.

325
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,478
You must learn
to suppress them all.

326
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:19,232
Otherwise, they will
consume you.

327
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:26,197
I can sense emotions
building inside you,

328
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:28,490
like a gathering storm.

329
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,995
If we begin now,
we may be able to stop them.

330
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:43,297
JANEWAY:
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

331
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,882
<i>It's been over an hour</i>

332
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:48,094
<i>since the shuttle</i>
<i>disappeared from sensors.</i>

333
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:49,887
I'm not detecting any debris.

334
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,305
Maybe the shuttle
was tractored

335
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:52,639
or transported
somewhere.

336
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,016
Scan the region.

337
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:56,269
Look for plasma emissions
or EM displacements,

338
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:58,145
anything that might
indicate another ship.

339
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,479
Nothing out of
the ordinary,

340
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,898
hydrogen, helium,
space dust.

341
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,400
There has to be
something out there.

342
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,027
Shuttles don't just
vanish into thin air.

343
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,487
It's a gravimetric shear.

344
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:08,739
Source?

345
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:09,990
Unknown.

346
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,200
Red Alert.

347
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,744
Helm, full ahead.

348
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:22,420
We're caught in some kind
of subspace sinkhole.

349
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,964
It's pulling us in.

350
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,673
The gravimetric
shear's increasing.

351
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:27,967
Go to warp.

352
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,927
I can't establish
a stable field.

353
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,929
Then we need more power
to the impulse engines.

354
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:33,597
That won't be enough.

355
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,016
We've got to find a way to
counter the gravitational pull.

356
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,144
B'Elanna, vent three
million isodynes of plasma

357
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:41,272
from the nacelles. Chakotay,
reverse shield polarity.

358
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,860
( computer beeping )

359
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,528
We're clear.

360
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:51,949
Move us away. Stand down,
Red Alert. Secure all stations.

361
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,121
I'd say we have
a pretty good idea

362
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:58,831
what happened to that shuttle.

363
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:02,793
SEVEN:
The anomaly is approximately
600 meters in diameter.

364
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,502
It's out of phase
with normal space.

365
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:06,422
Even after recalibrating
the sensors,

366
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,756
it barely registers.

367
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,675
SEVEN:
The distortion
circumscribes

368
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,260
a subspace zone
that includes

369
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,095
a Type-G sun
and three planets.

370
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,306
Any sign of the shuttle?

371
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:17,141
No.

372
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:18,767
I'd say it's time
to break out

373
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,019
the multispatial probe.

374
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,479
Agreed.

375
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:22,938
What the hell is that?

376
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,941
A vessel approaching
off the port bow.

377
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,776
They've locked on
a tractor beam.

378
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,070
KIM:
<i>Captain to the Bridge.</i>

379
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:36,076
I'm only going
to say this one more time.

380
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,870
Disengage
your tractor beam, Sir.

381
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:42,458
<i>You were in danger of being</i>
<i>pulled into the distortion.</i>

382
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:45,294
<i>You should show</i>
<i>a little gratitude.</i>

383
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:48,255
We appreciate your help,
but we didn't ask for--

384
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,469
Captain, this
is Mr. Yost.

385
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:58,432
<i>Supervisor Yost,</i>
<i>Renovation Team Nova.</i>

386
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:01,435
Captain Janeway
of the Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

387
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:03,979
<i>Until tomorrow,</i>
<i>I suggest you stay</i>

388
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:07,649
<i>at least two million kilometers</i>
<i>from the distortion.</i>

389
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:08,859
What happens tomorrow?

390
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:11,737
<i>The rift will be</i>
<i>closed by then.</i>

391
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,114
Some of our crew
are trapped inside.

392
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,700
<i>I am sorry.</i>

393
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:21,080
<i>We have lost 11 ships to the</i>
<i>distortion over the last year.</i>

394
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,956
<i>It must be sealed.</i>

395
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,875
What about
your people?

396
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,252
<i>Even if there</i>
<i>were survivors,</i>

397
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:28,462
<i>there's no way</i>
<i>to rescue them.</i>

398
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:29,922
<i>The best we can do</i>

399
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:33,050
<i>is to prevent others</i>
<i>from being trapped.</i>

400
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,676
We can't abandon our crew.

401
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,720
If you could delay
your mission--

402
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,308
<i>My orders are to seal the rift</i>
<i>by this time tomorrow.</i>

403
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:45,271
<i>If you want to attempt a rescue</i>
<i>between now and then,</i>

404
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:50,526
<i>the risk is yours to take...</i>
<i>but I wouldn't advise it.</i>

405
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,820
Launch the probe.
Aye, Captain.

406
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,073
Work with B'Elanna and Seven
to enhance the sensors.

407
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:57,908
Do whatever you can
to find Tom and Tuvok.

408
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:01,495
I'll look for a way to counter
those gravitational forces.

409
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:06,875
( door chimes )

410
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,502
Come in.

411
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:10,712
I've been brushing up

412
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,756
on sinkholes,
quantum singularities.

413
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,174
Any luck?

414
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,135
All the data leads me
to the same conclusion.

415
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,803
They're mono-directional
phenomena,

416
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,138
what goes in
doesn't come out.

417
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,473
Well, if it's
any consolation,

418
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:22,266
something's coming out
of that anomaly.

419
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:23,517
What is it?

420
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:24,935
Telemetry from our probe.

421
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:27,020
We've located
the shuttle's distress beacon

422
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,855
on a Class-D planet.

423
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:31,108
Vulcan, human, alien life signs.

424
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:35,695
At least we know they're alive.
Keep reading.

425
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,954
There's astronomical data here
covering a three-month period.

426
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,539
How is that possible?

427
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:48,542
There seems to be some sort of
temporal differential.

428
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,210
How big
a differential?

429
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,629
It's difficult to say,

430
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:53,797
but every hour
that passes for us,

431
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:57,009
could mean weeks, even
months for Tom and Tuvok.

432
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,261
Months trying to survive
in a Class-D environment?

433
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,430
And more than likely,
they've assumed

434
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,307
that we left them
behind long ago.

435
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:05,851
Ready for the bad news?
You're kidding.

436
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,228
The gravitational stress
is increasing.

437
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:11,524
Seven believes the sinkhole
is on the verge of collapse.

438
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:14,151
When it does, everything
inside will be crushed.

439
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,123
( door opens )

440
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,167
Noss!

441
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:43,347
Medical tricorder.

442
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,974
We were ambushed.

443
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,809
Give me 20 milligrams
of inaprovaline.

444
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:50,354
They got away with a pair of
resonator coils that we found.

445
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:51,605
Three fractured ribs,

446
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:54,107
subdural hematoma,
internal bleeding.

447
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,442
Will he live?

448
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,944
Vulcans are very resilient.
He'll be fine.

449
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:02,324
How long
has it been

450
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,159
since I was last activated?

451
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,037
Almost two months.
Two months?

452
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:12,334
So...what's new?

453
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,044
Oh, same old thing,

454
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:17,381
fighting off scavengers,
hunting spiders...

455
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:19,341
No word from<i> Voyager?</i>

456
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:21,427
They're probably
300 light-years

457
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,512
closer to
home by now.

458
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,181
I think
I should remain online

459
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,808
until Mr. Tuvok
is fully recovered.

460
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,813
It's good to have
you back, Doc.

461
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:51,665
Rest.

462
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,209
How long was
I unconscious?

463
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,378
Too many hours.

464
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,756
Mr. Paris?

465
00:29:58,756 --> 00:30:00,006
He'll be fine.

466
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,217
( sighs )

467
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:06,179
I was afraid.

468
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,891
It is good to see your eyes.

469
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:18,066
Don't.

470
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:25,991
I only want...
to show you how I feel.

471
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:39,045
You...you-you feel
nothing for me?

472
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,756
I told you,

473
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:44,176
I don't experience emotion.

474
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:50,098
I have developed an appreciation
and respect for you,

475
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,184
nothing more.

476
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:59,191
Nothing?

477
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:01,943
I am sorry.

478
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,863
I cannot return
your affection.

479
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:10,661
You cannot...
or you will not?

480
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:13,706
A minor distinction.

481
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:15,248
Logic!

482
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,542
I hate logic!

483
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,794
Your emotions will
only exacerbate

484
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:21,129
the situation.

485
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,506
<i>Shevrot kat!</i>

486
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:25,300
Insulting me
will not help.

487
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,011
<i>Derot oraht!</i>

488
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:39,189
We can use
the multispatial probe

489
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,482
as a transporter relay.

490
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,650
It'll take a little time

491
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,485
to reconfigure
the targeting scanners,

492
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,111
but with a little luck,
it should work.

493
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,697
Any reason we can't
use the same relay

494
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:48,741
to send a
com signal?

495
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:50,242
I don't see why not.

496
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,285
Good. Let them know
that help is on the way.

497
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,538
KIM:
<i>Captain to the Bridge.</i>

498
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,419
They've started
ahead of schedule.

499
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,545
Hail them.

500
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:02,962
YOST:
<i>Yes?</i>

501
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,256
It was my understanding

502
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,383
you wouldn't begin
for another six hours.

503
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:07,801
<i>We're ready now.</i>

504
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:08,968
Well, we're not.

505
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,387
We need at least
another two hours

506
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:13,515
to make a rescue attempt.
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

507
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,851
How long until
they seal the rift?

508
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,270
Approximately 30 minutes.

509
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,897
Then that's
all we've got.

510
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,159
Tuvok?

511
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,663
Hey!

512
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,957
I am meditating,
Mr. Paris.

513
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,500
I don't care.

514
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,669
I trust there is
an urgent reason

515
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,379
for your lack of courtesy.

516
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,548
You're damn
right there is.

517
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,383
What did you
say to her?

518
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,386
Our conversation
was private.

519
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,888
Well whatever
you said,

520
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,932
she's talking
about leaving,

521
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:56,600
going off by herself,

522
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,269
because it's too painful
to be around you.

523
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:03,356
She is under the influence
of unfettered emotions.

524
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,191
Well,

525
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:08,487
maybe you're able to
"fetter" your emotions,

526
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,530
but the rest of us
don't have that luxury.

527
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,199
She is a living,
breathing woman,

528
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,661
who, for reasons that
I can't begin to fathom,

529
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:17,704
has fallen in
love with you.

530
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,289
Now, if you're
incapable

531
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:20,666
of returning
her feelings,

532
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,709
at least show her
some compassion.

533
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,336
Try to let
her down easy.

534
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:27,881
There is no easy way
to recover from infatuation.

535
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:29,549
Oh, really?

536
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:33,470
And what do you know
about infatuation?

537
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,472
More than you might imagine.

538
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:38,308
Enlighten me.

539
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:41,102
I have no intention of
continuing this conversation.

540
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,646
Come on, Tuvok.

541
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:43,856
Come on!

542
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:47,776
It's just you,
me and the rocks.

543
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:59,746
When I was a young man...

544
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:03,834
I experienced an emotional
attraction toward a woman.

545
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:06,085
It nearly
destroyed me.

546
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:08,380
Your wife?

547
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,631
No.

548
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:14,302
Her name was Jara,
a Terrelian female.

549
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,971
I would have violated

550
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:18,682
every tenet of
Vulcan philosophy

551
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:20,893
simply to be near her.

552
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,437
She must have
really been something.

553
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:28,233
I lost all sense
of who I was.

554
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,695
The emotional attraction
I felt for her

555
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:35,281
became a kind
of...insanity.

556
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:39,578
Tuvok, everyone feels
a little insane

557
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,497
when they fall in love...

558
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,958
but it's worth the risk.

559
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:47,002
For you, perhaps,

560
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:49,128
but I am Vulcan.

561
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:53,592
My natural emotions
are erratic, volatile.

562
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:58,555
If I don't control them,
they will control me.

563
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:04,603
What ever happened to Jara?

564
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,855
I chose to leave her.

565
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:09,942
I spent several
months in isolation,

566
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:12,652
studying with
a Vulcan master.

567
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,363
I learned to suppress
my emotions.

568
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,040
Too bad.

569
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,418
( distant rumbling )

570
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,256
TUVOK:
Gravimetric distortions.

571
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,591
PARIS:
What's causing them?

572
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:35,926
Unknown.

573
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,481
No response to our hails,
Captain.

574
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,232
At this rate,
their anti-graviton beam

575
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,819
will seal the distortion
in approximately 29 minutes.

576
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,070
Transporter status?

577
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,780
I've completed
the reconfiguration,

578
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,364
but we're only going
to be able to relay

579
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,199
one transporter beam
through the probe.

580
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,868
We'll have to get Tom
and Tuvok

581
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,370
within a two-meter radius
of their distress beacon.

582
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,790
Harry?

583
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,625
I've opened
a channel.

584
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,294
<i>Voyager</i> to away team.

585
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,839

586
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:15,966
What is it?

587
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:17,175
The distress beacon.

588
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,635
We're receiving
a transmission.

589
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:21,013
Can you route it through
your com system?

590
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,894
PARIS:
If I'm right,
this message

591
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:31,148
was sent almost nine hours ago
on a very slow carrier wave.

592
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:32,983
Can you speed it up?

593
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:34,818
I'll try.

594
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:43,035
( slowly speeding up):<i> </i>
JANEWAY: Voyager<i> to away team.</i>

595
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:45,829
( normal speed ): 
<i>A transporter beam</i>
<i>with a radius of two meters</i>

596
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:47,455

<i>at the coordinates</i>

597
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,749
<i>of your distress beacon</i>
<i>in exactly 30 minutes.</i>

598
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,126
DOCTOR:
Thirty minutes?

599
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:53,003
That would have been
over eight hours ago.

600
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:54,796
Shh. There's more.

601
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:57,590
JANEWAY:
<i>Be advised we've detected</i>
<i>a temporal differential</i>

602
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,300
<i>between our two positions.</i>

603
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,180
<i>According to our calculations,</i>
<i>the differential ratio</i>

604
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,265
<i>is .4744 seconds per minute.</i>

605
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:09,186
<i>Repeat,</i> Voyager<i> to away team.</i>

606
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:11,980
<i>A transporter beam</i>
<i>with a radius of two meters--</i>

607
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,441
According to that formula,
30 minutes would translate

608
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:18,070
to two days, 11 hours
and 47 seconds.

609
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,113
Well, we've
waited this long.

610
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,823
Tom.

611
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,224
The force field is holding.

612
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:48,433
( explosion )

613
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,393
Not for long if
they keep pelting us

614
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,728
with these photon grenades.

615
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:52,979
( explosion )

616
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,564
How are we supposed
to hold them off

617
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:56,357
for two more days?

618
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:03,782
The rift will be sealed
in less than two minutes.

619
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,408
Move us into range.

620
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,410
Stand by
for transport.

621
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,578
Yes, ma'am.

622
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:10,122
The force field 's
losing power.

623
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:11,497
Time?

624
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:14,584
We still have another
hour before transport.

625
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,962
Where are you going?

626
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:19,380
To repair the field generator.

627
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,091
I will accompany you.

628
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,341
No. You stay.

629
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,385
Prepare for the attack.

630
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,929
You can't go alone.

631
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:30,683
Risking two lives...
would be illogical.

632
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:36,564
We're in
transporter range.

633
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:40,235
Link up with the probe,
and relay the signal.

634
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,611
TORRES:
Stand by.

635
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:44,322
I've got a lock
on their beacon.

636
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,741
They're supposed to be ready
for transport in 32 seconds.

637
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,743
Let's hope
they don't stand us up.

638
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:52,080
Begin 20 second countdown
on my mark.

639
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,666
Now.

640
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,169
We've got less
than ten minutes to transport.

641
00:38:57,169 --> 00:38:58,377
Where the hell is Noss?

642
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,713
I'll find her.

643
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,638
( both grunting )

644
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,351
( yells )

645
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,147
Fifteen seconds.

646
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:18,397
Fourteen...

647
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:19,732
Thirteen...

648
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:23,778
( yells )

649
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,203
( grunting, panting )

650
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:32,411
Tuvok...

651
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,664
I could not
leave you behind.

652
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,838
Nine...

653
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:43,464
Eight...

654
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,716
Seven...

655
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,425
Now, Mr. Paris!

656
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:51,139
( grunting )

657
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,439
PARIS:
Hurry.

658
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,444
Four...

659
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:07,113
Three...

660
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,365
Two...

661
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:10,616
Initialize transport sequence.

662
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,118
Energize.

663
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,752
We've got them.

664
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,257
KIM:
Welcome back.

665
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:26,758
Who...?

666
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,843
A friend.

667
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:42,148
TUVOK:
<i>Commander Tuvok, Personal Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 52438.9.</i>

668
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,692
<i>We are en route</i>
<i>to Noss' home world.</i>

669
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:48,280
<i>As I prepare to say goodbye,</i>
<i>I find myself experiencing</i>

670
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,282
<i>a certain discomfort.</i>

671
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:52,367
Tuvok.

672
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:55,995
Weird day.

673
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,372
Problems?

674
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,332
I've spent the
last two months

675
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01,709
wondering if I'd ever
see B'Elanna again.

676
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,669
As far as
she's concerned,

677
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,422
it's only been
two days.

678
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:07,924
I guess I expected her
to have missed me too.

679
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:09,634
Were it not for
the time differential,

680
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:11,177
I'm sure she
would've experienced

681
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,054
a deep sense of loss.

682
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:15,265
You know something?

683
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:16,474
I always thought

684
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,851
that beneath that
cold Vulcan exterior

685
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:23,522
lay a...even colder
Vulcan interior,

686
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:27,986
but now, I'm convinced
you're a hopeless romantic.

687
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:31,530
There is no need
to insult me, Mr. Paris.

688
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,574
NEELIX:
Oh, here they are now.

689
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:36,494
I was just getting Noss'
recipe for sautéed spiders.

690
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,289
She told me how much
you enjoyed them.

691
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:42,041
Let's just say it's
an acquired taste.

692
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,920
Goodbye, Tom.

693
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,636
Thank you.

694
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:59,642
Come on, Neelix.

695
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:00,893
Oh. Of course.

696
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,187

697
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:11,696
I'm sorry.

00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:15,158
For what?

699
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:20,538
I know how difficult
this was for you...

700
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:24,625
for us.

701
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,504
I just wish things
had been different.

702
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:30,215
As do I.

703
00:42:57,534 --> 00:43:00,453
( sighs )

704
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,331
I understand.

705
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,337
Thank you.

706
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:39,158
Live long and prosper, Noss.

707
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:45,123

You too.

Grief, anger, fear
and especially love,
