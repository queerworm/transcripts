Let them!
Sir?

6
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:20,145
Take the shields offline
and recharge the emitters.

7
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,939
That'll bring them up
to full power.

8
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:24,525
The charging cycle takes 45
seconds. We'll be vulnerable.

9
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,944
We'll be dead if we don't get
the shields back up.

He was in command of a science

His distress call

What's it doing

39
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,874
Perhaps it's searching
for<i> Voyager.</i>

40
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,500
The<i> Equinox</i> is
a Nova-class ship.

41
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,585
It was designed
for planetary research,

Did you know
this individual?

48
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,644
JANEWAY:
Only by reputation.

49
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,522
He was an exobiologist,
promoted to Captain

50
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:53,067
after he made first contact
with the Yridians.

51
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,027
Species 6291.

52
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:57,071
The collective determined
that they were extinct.

53
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,321
So did
the Federation.

54
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,614
Ransom proved
otherwise.

55
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,158
I always wanted
to meet him.

56
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,702
Too bad it won't be under
better circumstances.

57

I look forward to meeting
him as well and his crew.

my knowledge of humanity.

What's happening

They're being disrupted
by some kind of energy surges.

72

00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,118
There are no other ships

00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,369
( sighs )

185
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,207
So...

186
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,376
How's Earth?

187
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,420
I wish I could say.

188
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,589
( continues breathing
heavily )

189
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,926
You weren't sent here
to find us?

190
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,595
I'm afraid not.

191
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,139
We've been stranded in the
Delta Quadrant for five years.

192
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,475
We were pulled here against our
will by an alien called

193
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:25,435
BOTH ( in unison):
the Caretaker.

194
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,937
We'll compare notes
later on.

195
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,481
Let's get you
to<i> Voyager.</i>

196
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,869
We're here to commemorate
our honored dead.

197
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:46,039
Lieutenant
William Yates,

198
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,082
Lieutenant
John Bowler...

199
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,544
Ensign
Dorothy Chang...

200
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,879
Ensign
Edward Regis...

201
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,633
And Crewman David Amanti,
who all served

202
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,426
with distinction.
Their bravery

203
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,012
and sacrifice
will not be forgotten.

204
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,889
They will be
missed.

205
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,308
But now,
there is cause

206
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,519
for optimism.

207
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,813
Captain Janeway,
<i>Voyager...</i>

208
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,484
On behalf of
my crew...

209
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,403
thank you.

210
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,279
We'll have time to give

211
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,780
the newest members
of our family

212
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,575
a proper welcome
in the days ahead,

213
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:24,077
but right now,
we've got our hands full.

214
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,579
The<i> Equinox</i> is secure,

215
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,582
but its primary systems
are still badly damaged.

216
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:31,167
Harry, B'Elanna,
make it your priority.

217
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,128
Captain Ransom
has provided us with data

218
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,838
regarding
the alien attacks.

219
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,882
Tuvok, Seven,
you'll be working with

220
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,134
First Officer Maxwell Burke.

221
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,469
To kindred spirits...

222
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,347
may our journey home
together be swift.

223
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,099
Dismissed.

224
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,938
We should begin by familiarizing
you with<i> Voyager's</i> defenses.

225
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,440
Can you give me
a minute?

226
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,942
There's someone I'd like
to say hello to first.

227
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,611
We'll be in
the Astrometrics Lab.

228
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,112
Deck 8,
Section 29.

229
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,779
See you there.

230
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,034
BLT.

231
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,745
Max...

232
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,037
I tried to say
hello in Sickbay,

233
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,372
but you
were sedated.

234
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,790
I remember.
I thought I was dreaming.

235
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,668
( sighs )

236
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:19,132
So...
where's my sweater?

237
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,008
The blue one?

238
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,094
Class insignia
on the back?

239
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:27,974
We went to
the Academy together.

240
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,142
Ah...

241
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,810
Maxwell Burke.
Tom Paris.

242
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,104
Harry Kim.

243
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,648
Welcome aboard.

244
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:38,318
First Officer. Impressive.
The last time we talked,

245
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,027
you were about to drop
out of Starfleet.

246
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,280
I heard you beat me to it...
The Maquis?

247
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,490
For a while.

248
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,907
Until I ran into
these two.

249
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,159
( chuckling )

250
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,286
And it's been
hell ever since.

251
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,621
Well, I told
your resident Vulcan

252
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:50,955
I'd be
right with him.

253
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,249
Are you free later?
I'd love to catch up.

254
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,543
Why don't we all
have dinner together?

255
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,835
Sounds great.

256
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,047
( door opens, closes )

257
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,341
( sighs )

258
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,759
"BLT"?

259
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,885
Bacon, lettuce and tomato.
It was a nickname.

260
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,096
A nickname?
My initials.

261
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,932
Oh...
How romantic.

262
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,686
We broke up
over ten years ago.

263
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:14,020
No need
to go to red alert.

264
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,522
How about
yellow alert?

265
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,023
You're cute
when you're jealous.

266
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,317
Who's jealous?
See you on the<i> Equinox.</i>

267
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,027
Well,
Turkey Platter,

268
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,029
what do you say
we go to work?

269
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,782
Who's jealous?

270
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,704
Commander?

271
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,580
Um...
I've been assigned to one

272
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,041
of the repair crews
on the<i> Equinox,</i>

273
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,501
and I was wondering
if I could join

274
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,253
a different team...
Maybe one on<i> Voyager.</i>

275
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,714
Problem?

276
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:43,216
Just a little post-traumatic
stress syndrome.

277
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,759
Bad memories.

278
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,927
A few.

279
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,388
Actually,
I could use someone

280
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,972
with your
engineering abilities.

281
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,308
Well, thank you.

282
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,227
Such a clean ship.

283
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,063
I'm used to falling bulkheads
and missing deck plates.

284
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,733
In a few weeks, you won't
even recognize the<i> Equinox.</i>

285
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,984
You'll be happy
to go back.

286
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,653
Unless I stay.

287
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,488
You said you
could use someone

288
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,448
with my
engineering abilities.

289
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,617
I don't think your Captain
would appreciate that.

290
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,160
He's got a skeleton crew
as it is.

291
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,499
Engineering's
five decks down.

292
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,377
It's a long crawl through
the Jefferies tubes.

293
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,465
Deck 11.
( beeps )

294
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,468
I haven't set foot
in a turbolift

295
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,262
in over
three months.

296
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,931
Claustrophobia?

297
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,016
If one of those fissures
opened up in here,

298
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,268
where would
we take cover?

299
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,478
( whooshing )

300
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,774
It's only a graviton relay,
nothing to worry about.

301
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,859
Do I look worried?

302
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,361
( whirring )

303
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,618
Emergency stop!
( beeps )

304
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,663
Um,
if you don't mind,

305
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,749
I think I'd rather take
the Jefferies tube.

306
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,251
I could use
the exercise.

307
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,672
I've run a thermographic
analysis of our shields.

308
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,341
It revealed multiple
stress points.

309
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,760
We believe
they're the result

310
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,053
of alien attempts
to infiltrate our vessels.

311
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,597
TUVOK:
Each time a fissure opens

312
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,056
within a meter of
our shields,

313
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,809
it weakens them by
0.3 percent.

314
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,143
At the present rate,
we have less

315
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,478
than two days
to mount a defense.

316
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,020
According to
your bio-scans,

317
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,022
the aliens can
survive in our realm

318
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,357
for only
several seconds.

319
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,152
They're like fish
out of water,

320
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,780
but they can do a lot
of damage in those seconds.

321
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,406
Nevertheless,
it is a tactical weakness.

322
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,283
Perhaps we can
exploit it.

323
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:33,660
What have you got
in mind?

324
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,119
If we can show them we have
the ability

325
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,663
to hold them here,
they'll think twice

326
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,456
before launching
another attack.

327
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:41,250
JANEWAY:
But the question is,
how do we catch these fish?

328
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,252
You build a net.

329
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,379
Commander?

330
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,007
A multiphasic force field to be
exact. We wanted to see what we

331
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,343
were up against, so we built
a small chamber that could keep

332
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,052
one of them trapped
for several minutes.

333
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,721
If we could expand on
that technology,

334
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,640
we might be able
to create a latticework

335
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,517
of multiphasic force fields
around both ships.

336
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,478
Rudy?
If Captain Janeway agrees.

337
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,605
We'll need to examine
that stasis chamber.

338
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,398
I'm afraid that
won't be possible.

339
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,400
It's in our
research lab.

340
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,944
That whole section
was flooded

341
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,946
with thermionic radiation
during the last attack.

342
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,698
It'll be days before
anyone can go in there.

343
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,241
The design schematics
are in our auxiliary datacore.

344
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,995
I'll see if I can download them.
You give me a hand?

345
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,832
(<i> tranquil theme playing</i> )

346
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,253
I couldn't help
but notice your crew

347
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,297
calls you by
your first name.

348
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,883
When you've been
in the trenches

349
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:33,845
as long as we have,
rank and protocol are luxuries.

350
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:36,472
Besides, we're a long way
from Starfleet Command.

351
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,765
I know the feeling.

352
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,559
You seem to run
a pretty tight ship.

353
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,686
We've been known to let our hair
down from time to time,

354
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,646
but I find that
maintaining protocol

355
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,398
reminds us of where
we came from

356
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,066
and, hopefully,
where we're going.

357
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,526
It seems to work
quite well for you.

358
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,653
Oh, we've overcome
our share of obstacles,

359
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,864
warp core breaches,
ion storms,

360
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:54,866
a few rounds with the Borg.
The Borg?

361
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:57,994
We haven't seen so much as a
cube since the day we arrived.

362
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,747
Consider yourself lucky.

363
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,374
Have you ever run into
the Krowtonan Guard?

364
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,125
Never heard of them.

365
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,046
That's how we spent our first
week in the Delta Quadrant.

366
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,464
They claimed we violated
their territory.

367
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,926
I gave the order
to keep going.

368
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,219
I lost 39,

369
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,221
half my crew.

370
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,057
I'm sorry.

371
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:21,684
We never recovered
from that loss.

372
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,227
It changed everything.

373
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,645
What do you mean?

374
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,981
When I first realized
that we'd be traveling

375
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,901
across the Delta Quadrant
for the rest of our lives,

376
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:33,821
I told my crew that we had
a duty as Starfleet officers

377
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,949
to expand our knowledge

378
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,618
and uphold our principles.

379
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,119
After a couple of years,

380
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:44,206
we started to forget that
we were explorers.

381
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,042
Then there were times when
we nearly forgot

382
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,961
that we were human beings.

383
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,004
This is a Nova-class
science vessel

384
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:53,674
designed for short-term research
missions, minimal weapons.

385
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,885
You can't even go faster
than warp 8.

386
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,220
Frankly, I don't know
how you've done it.

387
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,598
You've obviously traveled
as far as we have

388
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,058
with much fewer resources.

389
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,310
I wish that I could take
all the credit,

390
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,228
but we stumbled
across a wormhole,

391
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,482
and made a few enhancements
on our warp engines.

392
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,028
I'd like to ask you something,
captain-to-captain.

393
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,237
Mm-hm.

394
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,032
The Prime Directive...

395
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,700
how often have you
broken it,

396
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,161
for the sake of
protecting your crew?

397
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,455
Broken it?

398
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,040
Never.

399
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,167
Bent it on occasion.

400
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,337
And even then,
it was a difficult choice.

401
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,589
What about you?

402
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,758
I've walked the line
once or twice...

403
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:39,012
but nothing serious.

404
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,888
There you are.

405
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,520
(<i> tranquil theme playing</i> )

406
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,396
It's a good omen.

407
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,858
Let's put it back
where it belongs.

408
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,292
I thought
I'd find you here.

409
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:14,005
How could I resist after
two years on emergency rations?

410
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,299
Don't get
too comfortable.

411
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,926
( sighs )

412
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,302
If Janeway's
any indication,

413
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,388
these people
will never understand.

414
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,516
They're going
to find out eventually.

415
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:28,519
Not if we keep them
out of the research lab

416
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,564
and away from
the warp core injectors.

417
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,816
And be careful what you say
around their crew...

418
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:37,820
And that includes
old girlfriends.

419
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,279
Understood.

420
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,115
(<i> tranquil theme turns</i>
<i>dramatic</i> )

421
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,868
Mm...
Not bad.

422
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,590
How's my angel
of mercy?

423
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,925
Crewman Lessing.

424
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,718
I didn't expect you
to recover so quickly.

425
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:02,929
You have
an outstanding EMH.

426
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,264
Ours can barely hold
a laser scalpel.

427
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,474
The doctor
is efficient.

428
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:11,020
I've been assigned to help you
sort through our biodata.

429
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,772
You saved my life.

430
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,690
The least I can do is
save you a little time.

431
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,401
( whirring )

432
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,653
( console beeping )
Lateral shields are offline.

433
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,947
How's that possible?

434
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,407
Fissures are opening on
Decks 1, 8 and 11.

435
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,118
Reroute power!

436
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,496
( whirring fades away )

437
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,124
What happened?

438
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:34,252
Apparently, the aliens began
to focus their attacks

439
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:35,586
on a single shield vector.

440
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:36,921
It collapsed

441
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:39,257
before the auxiliary emitters
could respond.

442
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:41,217
It looks like they've changed
their tactics.

443
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,510
We may have less time
than we thought.

444
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,679
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

445
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,392
SEVEN:
We've examined
the schematics

446
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,852
of your
multiphasic chamber.

447
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,187
It can
be adapted.

448
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:54,438
We intend to
create

449
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:57,150
an auto-initiating
security grid.

450
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,318
TUVOK:
The moment an alien
invades either ship,

451
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,570
a force field
will surround it.

452
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,948
Once we modify
our field generator to emit

453
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,449
multiphasic
frequencies,

454
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,785
it will power the security
grids on both ships.

455
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,036
How long will
it take?

456
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,871
Approximately
14 hours.

457
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,499
We don't know when they'll break
through again. We may not last.

458
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,584
CHAKOTAY:
We could cut the time
in half if we

459
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,253
evacuate all personnel
from the<i> Equinox,</i>

460
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,130
and focus our efforts
here on<i> Voyager.</i>

461
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,673
Remember,
we are still

462
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,800
35,000 light years
from Earth.

463
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,385
We should try
to preserve both ships.

464
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:28,264
With two vessels, we'd be able
to pool our resources,

465
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,683
doubling our chance at
finding a shortcut home.

466
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,226
Normally, I'd agree,
but right now,

467
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:34,270
one of our ships
is vulnerable.

468
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,022
Chakotay's right.

469
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,398
We should make
our stand on<i> Voyager.</i>

470
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:41,819
I don't want
to force the issue,

471
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:44,947
but I am prepared
to return to the<i> Equinox</i>

472
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,532
with my crew.

473
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:52,205
What is the protocol
in this situation?

474
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:54,207
We have two Captains
and two ships.

475
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:55,708
Who gets the last word?

476
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:59,962
Starfleet Regulation 191,
Article 14.

477
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:04,133
"In a combat situation
involving more than one ship,

478
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:07,636
command falls to the vessel
with tactical superiority."

479
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,056
I looked it up this morning.
Good thinking.

480
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:13,517
In this case, protocol
recognizes my authority.

481
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,603
Are you ordering me
to abandon my ship?

482
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,272
I'd rather not have to.

483
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,067
And that protocol was written
in the Alpha Quadrant.

484
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:24,362
I'm not so sure that it makes
much sense out here.

485
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:27,198
The regulation stands.

486
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:31,035
Who am I
to dispute protocol?

487
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:34,538
Give Captain Janeway
your full cooperation.

488
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,957
Rudy...
Max, that's an order.

489
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,292
We'll get through this.

490
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:40,211
If that's all,
Captain,

491
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:41,795
I'd like to return
to my quarters

492
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,214
and collect
a few mementos.

493
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:45,007
By all means.

That is
a command station.

500
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:21,043
It's off-limits without
my direct authorization.

501
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,211
I didn't realize.

502
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:23,587
You gonna throw me
in the brig?

503
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:26,382
I think we can overlook
this infraction.

504
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,384
Can I help you
with something?

505
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:31,220
I'm just doing some homework,
studying your propulsion system.

506
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,722
If there's a chance I'm gonna
be stuck on<i> Voyager,</i>

507
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,433
I figured I'd better
learn my way around.

508
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:37,143
Maybe you could tutor me
over dinner.

509
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:39,186
Problem is...

510
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,147
you were never really
interested in the work.

511
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,440
Or the meal.

512
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,816
( chuckles )

513
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,525
Something tells me
you haven't changed.

514
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,278
You'd be surprised.

515
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:49,655
I'm not the...

to you.

Don't get me wrong.

It's good to see you again,
but ten years...

You could do worse.

for dinner?

Get going...

528
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:25,274
or I will throw you
in the brig.

529
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,236
Before we abandon
the<i> Equinox,</i>

530
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,571
we should try to salvage
any useful components.

531
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,866
Let's start with
your dilithium crystals.

532

Mm, what we have
left of them.

00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,119
I'm afraid we only
have a few isograms.

534
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,372
That's barely enough
to power the sonic showers.

535
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:41,832
Can I make a suggestion?
Please.

536
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:43,417
Let's forget about
the primary systems.

537
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,627
They're too badly damaged.
Let's focus on supplies.

538
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,255
We picked up a few items
I think might come in handy,

539
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,966
Uh... Two kilotons
of kemacite ore,

540
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,135
a dozen canisters
of mercurium.

541
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:55,304
Tell Neelix to make room
in Cargo Bay 1.

542
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:56,680
Right.

543
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,182
Could you use
a synaptic stimulator?

544
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:01,268
Depends.
What is it?

545
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:04,021
It's a neural interface
you wear behind your ear.

546
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,772
It taps into
your visual cortex

547
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,025
and shows you
different alien vistas.

548
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,363
Just think of it as
a poor man's holodeck.

549
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:15,157
So that's how you
kept yourself entertained.

550
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:17,784
Beats checkers.
The Ponea gave it to us.

551
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,995
Never heard of them.

552
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,039
We call them the life of
the Delta Quadrant.

553
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,875
They see every first contact
as an excuse to throw a party.

554
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,336
( all chuckle )

555
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,463
I wish that we...

556
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:31,631
had encountered
more species like that.

557
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,719
You're the first
friendly faces

558
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,846
we've seen in months.

559
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,806
I'm glad we found you.

560
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:42,393
The feeling is mutual.

561
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:45,354
Those modified plasma injectors
looked elaborate.

562
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:46,939
What were you trying
to do?

563
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,942
Uh...
We were experimenting

564
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,319
with ways to enhance
our warp drive. It didn't work.

565
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,029
Maybe we should let
B'Elanna take a look.

566
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,489
It won't work.

567
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:56,949
Um...
We tried for months.

568
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:58,242
NAOMI:
Excuse me.

569
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:00,327
Oh, hello,
there.

570
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,037
Commander,
permission to interrupt?

571
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,247
Granted.

572
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:04,540
Ensign Gilmore.

573
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,749
That's right.

574
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,751
Naomi Wildman,
Captain's Assistant.

575
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,627
GILMORE:
Is that so?

576
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:12,214
I wanted to officially welcome
you aboard the Starship<i> Voyager.</i>

577
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:13,549
I'm glad to be here.

578
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,968
If you need anything,
replicator rations,

579
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,178
a tour of the lower decks,
I'm your man.

580
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,556
Thank you, Miss Wildman.
I'll keep that in mind.

581
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,266
As you were.

582
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,101
( chuckling )

583
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:26,353
I didn't realize that
you had children on board.

584
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,854
Only one.

585
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,315
She was born here.

586
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,275
Mmm. I have a nephew
back on Earth...

587
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:32,568
The same age.

588
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:35,529
Well...
Not anymore.

589
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,531
I guess
he's a teenager by now.

590
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:40,618
I probably wouldn't even
recognize him.

591
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:42,411
You'll see him again.
( comlink beeps )

592
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:45,247
RANSOM:<i> Ransom to Gilmore.</i> 
Yes, Captain.

593
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:47,374
RANSOM:
<i>Report to the</i> Equinox<i> Bridge.</i>

594
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,875
On my way.

595
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,877
Duty calls.

596
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:54,173
Assemble a salvage team.

597
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,841
Aye, sir.

598
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:59,303
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

599
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:02,264
BURKE:
Once we take their field
generator, we'll part company.

600
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,099
What happens
to<i> Voyager?</i>

601
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,519
They have weapons, shields, a
full crew. They'll survive.

602
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,145
Maybe we should
abandon ship...

603
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,688
Try to forget everything
that's happened here.

604
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,983
A shower
and a hot meal.

605
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,070
I guess that's all it takes

606
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,365
for some of us to forget
what's at stake here.

607
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,034
We're going home.

608
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,578
We can't let<i> Voyager</i> 
stop us now,

609
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:27,080
not when we're this close.

610
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,249
Now, we're proceeding
as planned.

611
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:32,085
Are there
any other objections?

612
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:36,882
I need each and every one of you
to give me your very best...

613
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:40,010
As you always have.

614
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,387
Max.

615
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:43,889
This won't be easy.

616
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,641
The generator
is located on Deck 11,

617
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:47,267
next to the
warp plasma manifold.

618
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,603
We can't get a clean lock
without boosting the signal.

619
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,980
Marla, we need you to set
aside your claustrophobia

620
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,566
and crawl through
the access port

621
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,108
and set up the
transport enhancers.

622
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,735
Understood.

623
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,237
We'll have to take

624
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,947
the internal sensors
in that section off-line.

625
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,366
Noah,
you're elected.

626
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,950
You can count on me, sir.
I'll disengage

627
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,494
the power couplings
from Engineering.

628
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,037
( sighs )

629
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:09,373
You'll all have time for one
last shower.

630
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:11,500
Make the most of it.

631
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,210
There's a minor
power fluctuation

632
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,503
in the
security grid.

633
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:15,754
It's within
tolerance.

634
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,464
I believe
I can correct it.

635
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,508
The discrepancy is in
the<i> Equinox</i> research lab.

636
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:21,510
If we can determine
the exact frequency

637
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,011
of their
multiphasic chamber,

638
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,222
I will tune our
field generator to match it.

639
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:28,058
There are times when perfection
hinders efficiency.

640
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:29,851
This is odd.

641
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,270
The lab
is still permeated

642
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,439
with high levels
of thermionic radiation.

643
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,649
It should have
dissipated by now.

644
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:37,610
I believe
I have an explanation.

645
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,862
Three EPS conduits
have been rerouted to the lab.

646
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,490
It appears they are
emitting the radiation.

647
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,702
TUVOK:
The lab was contaminated
intentionally.

648
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,746
Any theories?

649
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:50,205
Only one.

650
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,291
Ransom doesn't want us
to enter the research lab.

651
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,042
He has been
adamant about

652
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,836
protecting his ship.

653
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,590
I thought it was simply
a Captain's pride.

654
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,967
I want to take a closer look
at that lab.

655
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,595
If we close off
those EPS conduits, how long

656
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:06,138
will it take to vent
the radiation?

657
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,307
Several hours.
I don't wanna wait that long.

658
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,016
Send the doctor.

659
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,060
He'll be immune to
its effects.

660
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,980
Tell him to look for anything
out of the ordinary.

661
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,357
Monitor his progress
from Astrometrics.

662
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,942
Shall I notify
Captain Ransom?

663
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,653
Not yet.

664
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:23,656
I want to wait
until we test your theory.

665
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:26,825

00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:41,507

(<i> dramatic theme grows</i>

668
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,994
I've found
the multiphasic chamber.

669
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:14,331
There's some kind
of organic mass inside.

670
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:17,334
It appears to be a member
of the alien species,

671
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:20,128
<i>but its cell structures</i>
<i>have vitrified.</i>

672
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,339
This is more than just
a stasis chamber.

673
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:24,966
It's some kind of
matter-conversion technology.

674
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:28,428
Hold on.
There's a control port here.

675
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,722
Hm.

676
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:31,431
Doctor?

677
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,975
DOCTOR:
<i>The chamber contains</i>
<i>a polaron grid</i>

678
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,353
and a sub-molecular
resequencer.

679
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:37,688
It looks like
it was designed

680
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:39,398
to convert
the alien cell structures

681
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,650
into some kind
of crystalline compound.

682
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,444
That function was not
specified in their schematics.

683
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:47,239
I have a feeling there's
a lot here they didn't specify.

684
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:51,869
I've accessed
their research logs.

685
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:54,538
They're encrypted, but judging
by the file headings,

686
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:57,332
they've performed this procedure
dozens of times.

687
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:02,755
( beeping )

688
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,761
More of
the alien compound.

689
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:10,970
But it's been
biochemically altered.

690
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,390
They've extracted
the base proteins.

( beeping )

692
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,481
Its molecular structure
is most unusual.

more specific?

I'm no engineer,
but I'd say

they were trying
to convert this material...

00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:35,746
into a source of power.

Power couplings?

Bypass controls have been
routed to our Bridge.

All you need to do
is say energize.

at 1900 hours.

710
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,946
We'll have to act
before then.

00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:12,365
Tell the others
to be prepared to...

712
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:15,494
Max.

713
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,830
The Transporter Room's not far
from here. Keep moving.

714
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:23,543
Captain Janeway wishes
to speak with you.

715
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:26,421
JANEWAY:
The alien compound.

716
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,715
Ten isograms.

717
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,259
If I understand
your calculations,

718
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,178
that's enough to increase
your warp factor by,

719
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:36,389
what, 0.03 percent
for one month?

720
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:39,643
Unfortunately, that boost
wouldn't get you very far.

721
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,937
So you'd need to replenish
the supply.

722
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:44,523
And that means
killing another lifeform.

723
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:45,816
And then another.

724
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:47,317
How many lives

725
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:49,569
would it take to get you back
to the Alpha Quadrant?

726
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:54,199
I think you know
the reason we're under attack.

727
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:58,036
These aliens are trying
to protect themselves from you.

728
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:02,541
Sixty-three. That's how many
more it will take.

729
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:05,711
Every time I sacrifice
one of those lives,

730
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:08,005
a part of me
is lost as well.

731
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:11,925
I might believe that if I hadn't
examined your research.

732
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:14,427
These experiments
were meticulous,

733
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,929
and they were brutal.

734
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:19,016
If you'd felt any remorse,
you'd never have continued.

735
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:21,643
Starfleet Regulation 3,
Paragraph 12.

736
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,102
In the event
of imminent destruction,

737
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,813
a Captain is authorized
to preserve

738
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:27,482
the lives of his crew
by any justifiable means.

739
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:30,276
I doubt that protocol
covers mass murder.

740
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,862
In my judgment,
it did.

741
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:33,363
Unacceptable.

742
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:36,324
We had nothing.
My ship was in pieces.

743
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,659
Our dilithium was gone.

744
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,661
We were running on
thrusters.

745
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:42,163
We hadn't eaten
in 16 days.

746
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,373
( sighs )

747
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,584
We had just enough power
to enter orbit

748
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,586
of an M-Class planet.

749
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:50,756
And lucky for us,
the inhabitants were generous.

750
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:53,466
<i>They were called the Ankari.</i>

751
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,343
<i>And they provided us</i>
<i>with a meal</i>

752
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:59,389
<i>and a few supplies,</i>
<i>even some dilithium crystals.</i>

753
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:01,850
<i>They even performed one</i>
<i>of their sacred rituals</i>

754
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,561
<i>to invoke spirits</i>
<i>of good fortune</i>

755
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:07,313
<i>from another realm</i>
<i>to bless our journey.</i>

756
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,611
<i>But these weren't spirits.</i>

757
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:15,864
<i>They were</i>
<i>nucleogenic lifeforms.</i>

758
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,741
<i>Our scans revealed</i>
<i>that they were emitting</i>

759
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,034
<i>high levels of antimatter.</i>

760
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,744
<i>Later that same night,</i>

761
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,871
<i>we managed to obtain</i>
<i>one of the summoning devices</i>

762
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:26,207
<i>in exchange for</i>
<i>an energy converter.</i>

763
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:29,461
<i>We constructed</i>
<i>a containment field</i>

764
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,088
<i>that would prevent</i>
<i>the lifeform</i>

765
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:33,381
<i>from vanishing so quickly.</i>

766
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,051
<i>But something went wrong.</i>

767
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:37,302
( screeching )

768
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,471
Get it
out of there.

769
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,848
RANSOM:
<i>We tried to send it back.</i>

770
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,810
( screeching )

771
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,145
We can't.

772
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,772
RANSOM:<i> </i>
<i>But it was too late.</i>

773
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,859
We examined the remains
and discovered

774
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:56,863
it could be converted to enhance
our propulsion systems.

775
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,323
It was already dead.

776
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,993
What would you
have done?

777
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:02,911
We traveled over
10,000 light years

778
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:04,663
in less than two weeks.

779
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,623
We'd found our salvation.

780
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,249
How could we ignore it?

781
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:11,544
By adhering to the oath
you took as Starfleet officers.

782
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:14,506
to seek out life,
not destroy it.

783
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:17,258
It's easy to cling to principles
when you're standing on a vessel

784
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,760
with its
bulkheads intact,

785
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,262
manned by a crew
that's not starving.

786
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,473
It's never easy,
but if we turn our backs

787
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:26,143
on our principles,
we stop being human.

788
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:28,478
I'm putting an end
to your experiments,

789
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:31,189
and you are hereby relieved
of your command.

790
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,275
You and your crew
will be confined to quarters.

791
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,488
Please,
show them leniency.

792
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,490
They were only following
my orders.

793
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:43,660
Their mistake.

794
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,830
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

795
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,671
It's a long way home,
Captain.

796
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,843
( door closes )

797
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,472
Doctor,
return to their research lab

798
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,892
and retrieve all the data
you can locate on the aliens.

799
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:08,560
I wanna find a way
to communicate with them.

800
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,478
Aye, Captain.
Go to their engine room.

801
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,522
Take those warp core
modifications offline.

802
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:13,899
Captain?

803
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:16,902
Let's try to make first contact
the right way.

804
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:23,282
What's going
to happen to us?

805
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,284
That's up to
Captain Janeway.

806
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,703
You'll be confined
to quarters

807
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,454
until we can find
a way to make peace

808
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,415
with these lifeforms
you've been killing...

809
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:31,958
if it's not
too late.

810
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,211
To be honest,
I'm glad you stopped us.

811
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:36,755
Living the rest of my life
knowing what we'd done.

812
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,173
You could've
stopped yourself.

813
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,299
Why didn't you?
I don't know.

814
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:42,301
When the Captain ordered me
to modify the warp core,

815
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,763
I concentrated
on the work.

816
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,557
I tried not to think about
how it was gonna be used.

817
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,893
Well, think about it now
because we need your help.

818
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,355
Commander?
After you.

819
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,482
We're having trouble
making sense of all this.

I can't access them.

822
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,571
Do you know
the decryption codes?

823
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,991
Your Captain's
been relieved of command.

824
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,826
You take orders
from me now.

825
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,704
Do you have
the codes?

826
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,539
Yes.

827
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,416
Proceed.

828
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,588
Think of it this way,
Ensign.

829
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,590
You might live with yourself
a little easier.

much time.

885
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,538
SEVEN:
<i>Understood.</i>

886
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,418
The<i> Equinox</i> crew
has been infected

887
00:41:01,418 --> 00:41:02,668
with a
mutagenic virus.

888
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,045
It may be
contagious.

889
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:06,005
I've been authorized
to inoculate them.

890
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,842
You've all
contracted a virus.

891
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,469
I'll need
to treat you.

892
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,720
A virus?

893
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,306
Doctor's orders.

894
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,229
( quietly ):
It's me.

895
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,815
Activate
the grid.

896
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:25,400
( buzzing )

897
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,526
What happened?
I don't understand.

898
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:29,028
This should be
working.

899
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,030
I'm running a
system-wide diagnostic.

( grunting )

902
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,996
I'm reading phaser fire
on Deck 9, crew quarters.

903
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,789
Security,
seal off Deck 9.

904
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,749
Shields are weakening.
They're down to 84 percent.

( comlink beeps )
TUVOK:<i> Tuvok to Bridge.</i>

906
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,586
The field generator
is offline.

907
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,339
Its power couplings
were disengaged.

908
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:49,174
Someone reconfigured
the internal sensors

909
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:50,508
so we couldn't
detect it.

910
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,593
Whatever it takes,
get that grid online.

911
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,805
I rerouted transporter control
to a panel in the next junction.

912
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:57,390
We can--

(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

917
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,039
They've sealed off
the deck.

918
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,248
Don't worry.

919
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,875
We're getting out
of here.

920
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,126
Shields down
to 52 percent.

921
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:26,711
KIM:
Captain, unauthorized

922
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:29,088
transport in progress.
It's the<i> Equinox</i> crew.

923
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,383
Block it.

924
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:34,427
They've bypassed Ops Control.
They're on their Bridge.

925
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:35,636
Forty percent.

926
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,596
Janeway to
Seven of Nine.

927
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,101
JANEWAY:
<i>Seven, respond.</i>

928
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,529
Damn!
What is it?

929
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:54,030
B'Elanna's erected
a force field.

930
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,323
I can't get a lock
on the generator.

931
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:57,116
Try overriding
the command codes.

932
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,451
( console beeping )

933
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,578
Someone's disrupting
the force field.

934
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,121
It's Max.

935
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,874
He's using one of his
triquadric algorithms.

936
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:07,544
I taught him how to do that
10 years ago.

937
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:09,712
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

938
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:15,468
Shields are failing. We've got
less than one minute.

939
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:16,719
Open a channel.

940
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,846
If you don't stop
what you're doing,

941
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,265
we'll both be destroyed.

942
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:22,517
<i>What's my alternative,</i>
<i>30 years in your brig?</i>

943
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:24,394
I'll open fire if I have to.

944
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:26,729
<i>We've been through worse.</i>

945
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,941
Target their power systems.
( beeps )

946
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,901
Fire.

947
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:33,736
Max!

948
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,154
Stand by!

949
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:38,741
Okay, BLT, let's see
if you remember this trick.

950
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:41,911
Bridge, they've got
the field generator.

951
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:43,538
What do you mean,
they've got it?

952
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:45,664
I don't know how,
but they beamed it off<i> Voyager.</i>

953
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:47,208
Get us out of here.

954
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,001
I can't.
Warp drive is down.

955
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,378
Bridge to Marla.
Report.

956
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:51,921
One of their crew tried
to dismantle

957
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:54,715
the antimatter injectors.
Repairs are underway.

958
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,134
What about
the field generator?

959
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,594
I'm integrating it
now.

(<i> dramatic theme continues</i> )

961
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,600

It's now or never.
Generator's in place.

965
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,445
I'm bringing
the grid online.

Take it to the lab.
