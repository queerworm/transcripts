00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,714
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 54274.7.</i>

2
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:07,925
<i>Lieutenant Torres</i>
<i>has finally convinced me</i>

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:11,345
<i>that I can't put off a major</i>
<i>maintenance overhaul any longer.</i>

4
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:12,971
<i>We've set down on</i>
<i>an uninhabited planet,</i>

5
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:15,724
<i>and I've sent shuttles</i>
<i>to search for supplies.</i>

6
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:19,019
- What about the impulse upgrades?
- Day after tomorrow.

7
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,604
Put a new phase compensator
on that relay.

8
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,189
Environmental control?

9
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,274
The thermal regulators
are still running a little hot.

10
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,984
Too bad we can't just keep
the windows open.

11
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,402
How long until the warp drive
is back on line?

12
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:28,612
Six days.

13
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,113
You sure you can't get it done
any faster?

14
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,866
Captain, I don't like sitting
still any more than you do,

15
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,077
but repairs this extensive
take time.

16
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,120
[equipment powering down]

17
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,248
Mendez, track down
that power drain.

18
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,290
Right away.

19
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:41,458
I know this ship
has been through a lot,

20
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,669
but you told me this would
only take a few days.

21
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,629
That was before I discovered
the microfractures

22
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:46,922
in the starboard nacelle

23
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,674
and the fused relays
in the main computer.

24
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:51,009
Who did that?

25
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:57,015
I noticed a charge imbalance
in the EPS feed.

26
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,684
I'm sorry if I...

27
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,352
It could have taken us hours
to find that.

28
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,939
I have a tactical
systems report for you.

29
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,649
It's from Commander Tuvok.

30
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:09,319
I'd say you're capable of a lot more
than delivering padds, Icheb.

31
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,779
[Janeway]
I agree.

32
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:14,908
Until we get underway again,
he's assigned to you.

33
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:18,245
With him on your team, maybe
you'll get this job done a little faster.

34
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,378
[snoring]

35
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:30,465
Neelix?

36
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:36,597
[alarm blares]

37
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,975
Rise and shine.
It's 0500.

38
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,519
Already?
Oh!

39
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,896
Oh, I was dreaming
we found the dilithium

40
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,982
and were back aboard Voyager.

41
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,693
Dreaming is
an accurate description.

42
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,613
Didn't we already
scan this nebula?

43
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,489
Four times.

44
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,867
I thought the Borg
were known for being thorough.

45
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,370
The Borg value efficiency,
not redundancy.

46
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,623
I've got a hunch
about this nebula.

47
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,207
There's dilithium
in there somewhere.

48
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,334
[console beeping]

49
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,713
I'm getting some fluctuating
energy readings.

50
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,048
From the nebula?

51
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,966
No, it's weapons fire.

52
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,374
Let's get out of here.

53
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,876
We're receiving a distress call.

54
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,002
[staticky]
...have casualties.

55
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,254
Please help us.

56
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:19,843
We're on a humanitarian mission
delivering medical supplies.

57
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,516
Reverse course.

58
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,976
We can't just leave them.

59
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,478
Starfleet policy.

60
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,230
Interference in alien conflicts
is strictly prohibited.

61
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,441
You heard their Captain.
It's a medical ship.

62
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,276
- [beeping]
- Their shields are down.

63
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,612
Life support is failing
on at least three decks.

64
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:42,866
Open a channel to the other ship.

65
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,870
This is Ensign Kim
of the Delta Flyer.

66
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,123
I don't know what you're fighting about,
but it looks like you've won.

67
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,667
The people on the other ship
have casualties. We'd like to...

68
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,461
This isn't your concern.

69
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,089
I'm not taking sides.
I only want to help the wounded.

70
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,132
[rumbling]

71
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,676
Withdraw immediately.

72
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,637
They're charging weapons.

73
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,141
Neelix, set our deflector beam
for a narrow pulse.

74
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:11,269
Seven, let me know the second
their weapons array is fully charged.

75
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,396
I might be able to trigger
an overload.

76
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,066
[Neelix] The deflector bandwidth
is at .4 microns.

77
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,567
Now.

78
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,910
Their weapons are off-line.
Shields are down.

79
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,329
They're retreating.

80
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,332
Take the helm.
Neelix, you're with me.

81
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,255
[staticky popping]

82
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,604
[groaning]

83
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,697
Who's in charge here?

84
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,407
He is.

85
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,701
What are we going to do?

86
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,578
It's okay.
We're here to help.

87
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,454
The ship that attacked you
is gone.

88
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:13,748
Who are you?

89
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,626
Harry Kim from
the Starship Voyager.

90
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,920
We're responding
to your distress call.

91
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,922
We can treat your wounded.

92
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,303
The Captain?

93
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,554
Dead, sir.

94
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,931
So are the rest
of the officers.

95
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:33,643
I'm reading a total
of 27 life-forms aboard the ship.

96
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,186
There were 56 of us.

97
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,731
How are we going to get home
without the officers?

98
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,649
We need to restore main power.

99
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,192
Where's the warp interface?

100
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,486
We're passengers,
not crewmen.

101
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,489
You can access
engineering systems from here.

102
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,913
[sighs]

103
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,710
[Kim]
Your warp core's intact.

104
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,171
I think I can bring it
back on line.

105
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,756
Can you monitor
antimatter flow?

106
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,758
I'm not sure. I...

107
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:09,428
Just watch this readout,
and tell me if it starts to fluctuate.

108
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,394
[core powering up]

109
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,192
[Kim] I'm routing emergency power
to structural integrity.

110
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,862
Atmospheric pressure
is returning to normal.

111
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,826
Neelix, we'll go through the ship
deck by deck-- find the survivors.

112
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,162
We need to get our cloak
back on line.

113
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,665
I'll take a look at it as soon
as I've repaired the engines.

114
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,541
No. The cloak
is more important.

115
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,378
The Annari have far more powerful
weapons than we do.

116
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,464
If they come back,
the cloak is our best defense.

117
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,800
We'll try to get it
back on line.

118
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,100
- Kim to Delta Flyer.
- [Seven] Go ahead.

119
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,893
I need your help, Seven.

120
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,979
It looks like we're going
to be here for awhile.

121
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,274
How did you do it?

122
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,401
[Kim] Do what?

123
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,653
Disable the Annari warship
so quickly?

124
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,573
Uh, basically, we used
their own weapons against them.

125
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,700
How?

126
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,870
We used a deflector pulse
to overload their phaser banks.

127
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:17,914
[power whirring on]

128
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,040
[groans]

129
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,710
You know a lot
about engineering.

130
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,671
It's all part
of my Starfleet training.

131
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:25,839
Starfleet?

132
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,174
Yeah. The organization
I work for.

133
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,093
And they teach you
all these things?

134
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,469
We train at an academy,

135
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,472
and I guess I've picked up
a few new tricks

136
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,391
during my time on Voyager.

137
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,143
How long have you been Captain?

138
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,352
[laughs]

139
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,770
I'm just an Ensign.

140
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,897
Ensign? E... What's that?

141
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,607
A junior officer.

142
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,361
The lowest ranked officer,
actually.

143
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,074
This is my first
deep space assignment.

144
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,036
It hasn't gone very well.

145
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,789
Could you hand me that?

146
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,836
My first week on the job
didn't go very well, either.

147
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,548
We ended up 70,000
light-years from home,

148
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,718
lost over a dozen crew members,

149
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,929
but I got through it,
and so will you.

150
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,975
I hope so.

151
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,562
If you're going to be
a starship officer,

152
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,940
you've got to accept that
adversity comes with the job.

153
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,664
What's that?

154
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,833
It's a diagnostic
of the antimatter injectors.

155
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,795
No, I meant that stuff
you're eating.

156
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,004
Nutritional supplements,

157
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,381
replicated to meet
my metabolic requirements.

158
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:51,674
Sounds delicious.

159
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,304
You know,
in the Mess Hall,

160
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,807
they actually have tables
and chairs for that.

161
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,643
I prefer to work while I eat.

162
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,770
It's a more efficient use
of my time.

163
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,691
You did a great job today.

164
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,153
We're ahead of schedule
thanks to you.

165
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,533
Here's what we're going
to work on tomorrow.

166
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,787
I'll see you at 0600.

167
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:27,919
Icheb.

168
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,255
Yes?

169
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,589
What do you do for fun?

170
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,176
- Fun?
- Recreation.

171
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,345
How do you spend your time
when you're off duty?

172
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:41,182
Between my work and my studies,
I don't have much time for recreation.

173
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:45,311
I've learned that you've got
to take a break once in awhile.

174
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,940
I've been doing a lot
of rock climbing on the holodeck.

175
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:52,235
Maybe when we're finished
tightening all the nuts and bolts,

176
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,528
you'd like to join me.

177
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,948
I do have an interest
in geology.

178
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,868
It's not about the rocks, Icheb.

179
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,536
It's about the climbing.

180
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,296
Main power
has been restored.

181
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,882
All stations responding.

182
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,466
The cloak's back on line.

183
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,344
Impulse and warp drives
are standing by.

184
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,597
Shields are at 96 percent.

185
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,849
I'd say you're ready
to get back on course.

186
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,225
We appreciate your help.

187
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:27,020
- I hope you have a safe journey.
- Mr. Kim...

188
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:31,357
I feel guilty
asking even more of you,

189
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,068
but no one on this ship
knows how to fly it.

190
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,781
None of you
has ever piloted a starship?

191
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:42,285
I've trained in shuttles,
but nothing like this.

192
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,412
[sighs]

193
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,541
I'll enter a flight plan
in the auto-navigation system

194
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,252
and give you a quick course
in helm operations.

195
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,795
You shouldn't have any trouble.

196
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:53,838
Couldn't you take us?

197
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,550
This ship needs an experienced
commanding officer.

198
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,637
I'm sorry, but we've already gotten
more involved than we should have,

199
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,305
and they need us back on Voyager.

200
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,557
It's not just my ship
that concerns me.

201
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,060
You've made an enemy
of the Annari now,

202
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,103
but if you dock your ship
in our Shuttle Bay

203
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,980
our cloak will protect you.

204
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,483
That's a generous offer,
but we'll be fine.

205
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,985
Please, Mr. Kim,
we can't afford to fail.

206
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,697
- This ship is...
- Loken, don't.

207
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,325
We can trust these people.

208
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,536
[Loken]
I'm a doctor.

209
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,248
These people
are my research team.

210
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,167
We're carrying new vaccines
to our homeland.

211
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,877
They'll save thousands of lives.

212
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:36,547
Sir, I looked at their flight plan.

213
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,133
It takes them pretty
close to Voyager.

214
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,806
I'll bring you
as far as our ship.

215
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,307
When we get there,

216
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,977
you can discuss your situation
with my Captain.

217
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,353
Thank you.

218
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,771
What about
Starfleet policy?

219
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,817
This is a humanitarian
mission.

220
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,444
Dock the Flyer
in their Shuttle Bay.

221
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,246
We're approaching the planet.

222
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,623
Take us out of warp.

223
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,917
- Disengage the cloak.
- Wait.

224
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,087
I'm detecting three
alien vessels in orbit.

225
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,423
On screen.

226
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,760
[Crewman]
Those are Annari warships.

227
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,554
Your people are in danger.

228
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,736
I apologize
for the state of my ship.

229
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:42,155
- We weren't expecting company.
- I hope we're not imposing.

230
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,323
Not at all.

231
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,908
Making contact with new cultures
is a priority for us.

232
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,035
For us, too.

233
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,329
This is a fine ship, Captain.

234
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,830
One of the best in the fleet,
but it could use

235
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,042
a new set of deuterium injectors.

236
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,918
Any chance you could
provide them?

237
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,713
I think we can arrange something.

238
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,174
What are you offering
in exchange?

239
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,300
Zeolitic ore.

240
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,677
We mined several tons of it
from an asteroid field.

241
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,929
It's high-grade, easy to refine.

242
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,015
I'll speak to my supply officer.

243
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,141
[console beeps]

244
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,602
We're being hailed
by Ensign Kim, audio only.

245
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,604
Hello, Harry.

246
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,148
- <i>Is everything all right?</i>
- Of course. Why wouldn't it be?

247
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:21,944
Our long-range scans detected
several alien ships orbiting the planet.

248
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,364
I appreciate your concern,
but there's nothing to worry about.

249
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,157
We've made some new friends,
that's all.

250
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,533
When can we expect you back?

251
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,994
We've run into a slight delay.

252
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,454
<i>Nothing serious, I hope.</i>

253
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,706
No. Everything's under control.

254
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,749
<i>Good.</i>

255
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,918
Any luck finding dilithium?

256
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,294
<i>Uh, I'm afraid not.</i>

257
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,046
I'll tell the other teams
to keep looking.

258
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,548
- See you soon, Ensign.
- <i>Yes, ma'am. Kim out.</i>

259
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,258
Dilithium...

260
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:45,968
We can get that
for you, too.

261
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,095
Really?

262
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,390
She's formed an alliance
with our enemy.

263
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:54,560
Just because they're talking
doesn't mean they formed an alliance.

264
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,687
It's probably just
a friendly meeting.

265
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,398
That's how the Annari operate.

266
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:01,818
They come to you as friends,
and when they've won your trust,

267
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,821
they declare you subjects
of the Annari Empire.

268
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,119
<i>Kim to Voyager.</i>

269
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,121
We didn't expect you so soon.

270
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,373
<i>Actually, Captain,</i>
<i>I'm closer than I let on,</i>

271
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,625
<i>and I've brought</i>
<i>some new friends of my own.</i>

272
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,381
Our chances of getting home
without your help aren't very good.

273
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,843
We'd appreciate any assistance
you could offer.

274
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,469
I hope you understand.

275
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,055
I need to give this some thought.

276
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,278
You've put me in
a difficult position, Ensign.

277
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,030
We could use the help
the Annari are offering,

278
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,324
but if they find out
we're aiding their enemy...

279
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,410
I couldn't just stand by
and do nothing.

280
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,496
That doesn't justify getting involved
in somebody else's fight.

281
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:57,915
What would you
have done?

282
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,001
Probably exactly what you did.

283
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,003
I guess I learned from the best.

284
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,881
If this were simply an errand
of mercy, I wouldn't hesitate.

285
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,759
But the fact is, these people
are involved in an interplanetary war.

286
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:12,638
Captain, I've gotten to know them
over the last couple of days.

287
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,098
You met Loken.

288
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,225
They're scientists, not soldiers.

289
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,227
You've only heard
one side of the story.

290
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,896
You've taken sides before.

291
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,939
The Borg resistance,
the Vaadwaur...

292
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,858
Those were
different circumstances.

293
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,776
You were trying to help people
in need.

294
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,361
How is this any different?

295
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,865
Have you thought about applying
to the Advocate General's office?

296
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,283
You'd make a good lawyer.

297
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,077
[sighs]

298
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:38,080
I suppose I could spare
Chakotay or Tuvok for a few days.

299
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,415
That won't be necessary.

300
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,961
The Kraylor know me.
They trust me.

301
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,882
I'm sure they'd find Tuvok
or Chakotay just as trustworthy.

302
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,885
But they outrank me.

303
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,638
If you send one of them,
it won't be my mission anymore.

304
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,681
Your mission.

305
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,808
My first real command.

306
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,852
You've been in command
on Voyager before.

307
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,188
On the night shift,
for a few hours...

308
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,814
It's not the same thing.

309
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:06,234
You and Chakotay are always
a couple of decks away,

310
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:09,028
ready to take over
if anything goes wrong.

311
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,405
I've been on Voyager
for almost seven years,

312
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:12,823
and I'm still an Ensign.

313
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:15,743
If this is your way
of bucking for a promotion...

314
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:19,914
No, no, I understand
there's a command structure

315
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,666
and that our circumstances
are unique.

316
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,877
But the fact is,
if we were back home,

317
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,754
I'd be a Lieutenant by now,

318
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,339
maybe even
a Lieutenant Commander.

319
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,509
You're pretty sure
of yourself, aren't you?

320
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,553
I know I can do this,

321
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,138
and the Kraylor are giving me
a chance to prove it.

322
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:41,435
I expect you back before
we complete our repairs.

323
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,812
Yes, ma'am.

324
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,897
And I'm not
sending you alone.

325
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,775
- Captain.
- I want you to take Seven.

326
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:51,445
Since she has no rank,
you clearly outrank her.

327
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:03,416
Lieutenant Torres asked me to repair
a malfunctioning holo-emitter.

328
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,709
[sighs]
It's about time.

329
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,628
Whenever I move
to the far corner

330
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,590
of the Surgical Bay,
my legs disappear.

331
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,723
Seven of Nine told me
you gave her social lessons.

332
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,517
Hmm. She wanted to get along
better with the crew.

333
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:25,062
Social skills are one thing
the Borg never assimilated.

334
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,690
I was hoping
you could instruct me, as well.

335
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,025
I'd be delighted.

336
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,901
Lesson One:
"Making a First Impression."

337
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,654
Actually, I wanted to ask you
about something specific.

338
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:34,780
Fire away.

339
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,992
How can you tell
when someone has...

340
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,911
romantic feelings for you?

341
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:44,040
Icheb, this <i>is </i>a surprise.

342
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,583
Have you caught
someone's eye?

343
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,753
I'm speaking hypothetically.

344
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,588
Ah.

345
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,714
[clears throat]

346
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,674
Hypothetically,

347
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:57,345
there are various indications
of romantic attraction.

348
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:02,266
Compliments, for example,
invitations to social activities,

349
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,811
finding excuses to be
in close proximity with someone.

350
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:09,565
Yes, but couldn't those things happen
in a relationship that wasn't romantic?

351
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,317
I suppose.

352
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,527
Is there a way
to be absolutely certain?

353
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:17,239
Well, short of an open
declaration of affection,

354
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,451
there are some fairly reliable
physiological responses:

355
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:24,622
elevated blood pressure, increased
beta-endorphin production...

356
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,416
Thank you, Doctor.
You've been very helpful.

357
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,169
With my guidance,
you will master the nuances

358
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,088
of social interaction
in no time!

359
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,466
[Paris]
Harry!

360
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,843
[sighs]
Take me with you, buddy.

361
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,762
Sorry, Tom.
This is my mission.

362
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,431
Oh, come on, I've been itching
to get back into space

363
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,600
ever since we set down
on this dust bowl.

364
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,395
I'm tired of cleaning conduits
and replacing relays.

365
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:50,690
You're a married man now.
You've got family responsibilities.

366
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,275
Just leave the away missions
to the young, unattached guys.

367
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,695
That ship is in pretty bad shape.
You're going to need a good pilot.

368
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:56,987
No, thanks.

369
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:58,114
Wait a minute...

370
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,200
I know what this is about.

371
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,410
You do?

372
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:05,913
Sure. You've got a girl on that ship
you don't want me to know about.

373
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,289
[laughing]

374
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,916
There's no girl.
Not this time.

375
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,377
Then what is it?

376
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,503
[sighs]

377
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,089
I don't know how else to say this,
so I'll just say it.

378
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,133
You've always been
Captain Proton.

379
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,009
I have always been Buster Kincaid.

380
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,137
It's my turn this time.

381
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,726
[indistinct chatter]

382
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,696
I'm glad you're not planning to leave
on an empty stomach, "Captain."

383
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:42,283
I have plomeek soup
and eggplant parmesan.

384
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,535
- Either's fine.
- Wrong answer.

385
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,661
Excuse me?

386
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:49,415
If you're going to be a Captain,
you have to act like a Captain.

387
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,917
Never admit you're
uncertain about anything.

388
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,462
You can't be indecisive
in front of your crew.

389
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,839
It's just a snack, Neelix.

390
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,258
When Captain Janeway
comes in here,

391
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,385
she knows exactly
what she wants.

392
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,637
Maybe I'm just not as picky
about my food.

393
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,850
Whatever you say... Ensign.

394
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,185
Neelix.

395
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,981
Plomeek soup,
and make sure it's hot.

396
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,116
Captain on the Bridge.

397
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,203
Where did you learn that?

398
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,955
I've been studying
that Starfleet manual you loaned me.

399
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,499
Take your station,
Mr. Terek.

400
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:32,625
Aye, sir.

401
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:34,960
Course?

402
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,086
I'll do it.

403
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:40,716
Laying in a course,
heading 115 mark 37.

404
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,303
Does this ship
have a name?

405
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,223
Medical Transport 136.

406
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,558
I think we can do
better than that.

407
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,438
Nightingale.

408
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,983
The name of someone
from my homeworld.

409
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:01,070
She was famous for treating
wounded soldiers on the battlefield.

410
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:03,864
It's perfect.

411
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:04,990
Hail Voyager.

412
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,618
[communications beep]

413
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,788
Kim to Voyager.
We're ready to get underway.

414
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,414
[Janeway]
<i>Acknowledged. Good luck.</i>

415
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,584
See you in a few days.
Kim out.

416
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,710
Main power.

417
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:18,546
- On line.
- Tactical.

418
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:21,465
Shields and weapons
standing by.

419
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:23,884
Bring the cloak on line.

420
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,846
Warp 6.

421
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,599
Engage.

422
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:44,905
[Kim] <i>Acting Captain's Personal Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 54277.3.</i>

423
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:46,907
<i>My first day in command</i>
<i>has been challenging,</i>

424
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:49,076
<i>but I've loved</i>
<i>every minute of it.</i>

425
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,246
<i>I can't help feeling that this was</i>
<i>something I was born to do.</i>

426
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,125
The hourly status report
you requested.

427
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:57,835
Thanks.

428
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,963
Why have you brought
these items aboard?

429
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,340
They make me
feel more at home.

430
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,634
We'll only be on this vessel
for a few days.

431
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,220
Decorating is an inefficient
use of your time.

432
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:10,890
It's important to forge
a personal connection

433
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,350
with your vessel;
make the ship your own.

434
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:14,810
Ask Captain Janeway.

435
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,646
I'll discuss it with her
the moment we return.

436
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,567
Is there anything else?

437
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,569
I asked Terek
to make a course correction.

438
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,279
He's never done that before.

439
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,114
I'd better check on him.

440
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,950
I believe he's capable
of doing it himself.

441
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,745
[sighs]

442
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,542
Status?

443
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:39,960
I've entered the new heading.

444
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,881
Looks like the guidance vector
is off by a couple of microns.

445
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,883
I was about to correct that.

446
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:49,511
You need to realign
the primary navigational sensor first.

447
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:50,971
Yes, sir.

448
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:54,767
And make sure it stays locked
on your guide star.

449
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,101
Here, let me show you.

450
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,075
I'm-I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

451
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,534
Don't worry about it.

452
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,703
Bumping elbows
comes with the job,

453
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,580
and you can call me B'Elanna.

454
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,999
Put this with the others.

455
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,421
These relays should have been
replaced a while ago.

456
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,548
It's amazing
they've held up this long.

457
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,052
I am really looking forward
to our climb.

458
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:34,932
Wouldn't you prefer to spend
your free time with your husband?

459
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,058
[laughs]

460
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,269
If it doesn't involve
a race car, a shuttle,

461
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:41,730
or something else he can drive,
Tom's not interested.

462
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:46,360
Besides, since we got married,
I see more than enough of him.

463
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,653
Hold still.

464
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:59,832
[alarm beeps]

465
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:00,916
What's that?

466
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,419
I'm reading a power fluctuation
somewhere in the propulsion system.

467
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,796
- It's destabilizing the cloak.
- All stop.

468
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,099
Core is stable.

469
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,601
That should take care of it.

470
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,020
Are you absolutely certain?

471
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:23,772
As a scientist, you should know

472
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,983
there's no such thing
as absolute certainty.

473
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,901
Perhaps we could run
a diagnostic before we...

474
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,069
That would take hours.

475
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:32,322
Captain Janeway wants us back
before Voyager finishes its overhaul.

476
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:35,409
The cloaking system is delicate.
It requires constant attention.

477
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,870
Correct me if I'm wrong,
you're a physician.

478
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,081
You have to trust me on this.

479
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,625
We'll monitor it closely.
Don't worry.

480
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:48,005
I simply want to ensure
that our mission is a success.

481
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,466
You asked me
to take command of this ship,

482
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:52,550
and that's what I'm doing.

483
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,435
Tell Terek to resume course.

484
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,611
I've discovered a serious flaw
in one of the ship's systems.

485
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,863
- Which one?
- The Captain.

486
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,743
The Captain's main function
is to issue orders, correct?

487
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,577
- Right.
- And the crew's function

488
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,247
is to support the Captain
and carry out those orders.

489
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:23,957
What's your point?

490
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:26,752
Every time you give an order,
you carry it out yourself.

491
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,421
And when someone else
makes a suggestion, you dismiss it.

492
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,507
These people are inexperienced.

493
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:32,800
They need my help.

494
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:36,720
When you first came aboard Voyager,
did Captain Janeway help you?

495
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,348
Sure. She looked after
all the junior officers.

496
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,058
By doing your work for you?

497
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,893
No. She gave me a lot to do,
actually.

498
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:46,355
Because she felt you were
more capable than she was?

499
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,148
Of course not.

500
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:51,985
She wanted me to learn,
to gain confidence.

501
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:54,612
Interesting.

502
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,458
Emergency power.

503
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:09,253
- Repolarize the containment field.
- I can't.

504
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,838
The cloak is going to fail again.

505
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,464
Don't panic.
This is a minor malfunction.

506
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,508
Minor? We're losing
our main defense system.

507
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,051
- [alarm sounds]
- [Terek] We've been detected.

508
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,514
Two Annari vessels are
closing on our position.

509
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:23,308
Correction--
six Annari vessels.

510
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,941
[rumbling, alarm sounds]

511
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,234
Evasive maneuvers!

512
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,862
Kim to Engineering.

513
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:36,613
Go ahead.

514
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,116
We need that cloak
back on line.

515
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,701
The primary generator
has failed.

516
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,536
I'm trying to...

517
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,620
[yells]

518
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:45,831
[Kim]
<i>Seven?</i>

519
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,375
Seven, come in.

520
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:50,794
You have the Bridge.

521
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:53,130
- We need you here.
- I'll go, sir.

522
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:57,634
All right. I'll give you
instructions over the com.

523
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,804
Charge phaser banks.

524
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,097
Target their weapons array.

525
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,348
Which ship?

526
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:06,602
The closest one,
off our port bow.

527
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:17,529
[groans]

528
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,156
Dayla to the Bridge.

529
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,782
Life support's failing
down here.

530
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,075
<i>I've gotten everyone out.</i>

531
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:24,494
Good work.

532
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,538
Now go
to the cloaking generator.

533
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,373
<i>What's the field polarity?</i>

534
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,125
206.4.

535
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,544
<i>That's too low.</i>
<i>We're going to have to raise it.</i>

536
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,004
I'm bypassing
the phase converter.

537
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,340
Wait. I didn't tell you
to do that.

538
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,966
Won't that increase
the field polarity?

539
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,802
- <i>Yes, but...</i>
- [coughing]

540
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,097
Listen to me carefully.
I want you to try...

541
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:45,599
Dayla, it's Loken.

542
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,435
- Take the warp core off-line.
- What are you talking about?

543
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:52,105
Bypass the driver coil and shunt power
directly to the polaron matrix.

544
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:55,150
[coughing]

545
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:04,034
The cloak is back on line.

546
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,452
Get us out of here,
full impulse.

547
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,831
Dayla, secure the Engineering section
and get back to the Bridge.

548
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,585
Dayla!

549
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,507
I'm not reading
any life signs in Engineering.

550
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,021
- Dayla?
- She's dead.

551
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,147
How's Seven?

552
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:36,900
She may be in shock.

553
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:38,026
I'm not sure.

554
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,862
Have a look.

555
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,958
Your opinion, Doctor?

556
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,127
I believe
she may be in shock.

557
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,964
Do you think we should give her
a cortical stimulant?

558
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,008
That might be indicated.

559
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,970
You are no doctor, are you?

560
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,057
You and I need to talk...

561
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,392
alone.

562
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,320
What the hell is going on?

563
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:23,030
I don't know
what you mean.

564
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:25,699
Nothing about this mission
is adding up.

565
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,701
It's obvious
you know a lot more

566
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,828
about cloaking systems
than biology.

567
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,038
So did Dayla.

568
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:33,248
And the second
our cloak failed,

569
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:36,376
half a dozen Annari warships
came after us--

570
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,838
one little medical transport.

571
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,506
The truth!

572
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:48,221
My colleagues and I have
been working at a secret base

573
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:49,806
but not to create vaccines.

574
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:53,643
We've been developing
cloaking devices for our fleet.

575
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:55,270
This ship is a prototype.

576
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,272
The Annari know we have it,

577
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,024
and they don't want us
to get it home.

578
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,484
I never would have agreed to this

579
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,694
if I had known
you had a military objective.

580
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:06,239
Our world has been under
an Annari blockade for three years.

581
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:10,035
The planet is protected
by a shield grid,

582
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:13,622
but it's almost impossible
to get our ships in or out.

583
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,541
I convinced Captain Janeway
this was a humanitarian mission.

584
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:17,918
It is.

585
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:22,464
The Annari are choking us
to death slowly.

586
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,509
If we can't get supply ships
through the blockade,

587
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,677
we can't get food
to our people...

588
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,013
or medicine.

589
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:34,893
For all I know,
that's another lie.

590
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,605
[door shuts]

591
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,442
Reverse course.

592
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:43,568
Sir?

593
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:46,363
- We're heading back to Voyager.
- I don't understand.

594
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,948
He knows about the cloak.

595
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,367
I would've told you...

596
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,285
- I gave you an order.
- What about the mission?

597
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:53,620
That's not your concern.

598
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,081
You want to be a starship officer?
Your job is to follow orders.

599
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,583
- Sir, I don't think you...
- This is not a debate.

600
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,752
You're under my command.

601
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,385
No, sir.

602
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,095
Not anymore.

603
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,471
You're relieved.

604
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:12,764
You, take the helm.

605
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,893
I believe you're the one
who's been relieved.

606
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,066
[humming]

607
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,112
Where are you going
in such a hurry?

608
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,405
Engineering,
to assist B'Elanna...

609
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,575
Lieutenant Torres.

610
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,827
Well, you've been seeing
a lot of my wife lately.

611
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,537
Should I be worried?

612
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,164
Mm, the repairs are extensive.

613
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:39,458
- It's a lot of work.
- You can't fool me.

614
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,586
I heard you two were planning
on scaling some cliffs together.

615
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,004
It was her idea.

616
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,213
Hey, relax.

617
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,591
Spending time on the holodeck
is good for you,

618
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,260
but if you really want
to have fun, forget climbing.

619
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,928
Try my race car program.

620
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:53,138
"Race car"?

621
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:56,641
You get to chase me around a track
in an old Earth ground vehicle.

622
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,268
300 kph.

623
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,978
It'll really get
your blood pumping.

624
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,731
Are you challenging me
to a competition?

625
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,941
Well, you think
you can take me?

626
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:07,694
Tomorrow, Holodeck 2,
1900 hours.

627
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:25,587
There is something
we need to discuss.

628
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,298
Sure, as soon as you help me
finish this diagnostic.

629
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,300
- I can't do this.
- Of course you can.

630
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:33,512
- You've done dozens of them.
- I'm not talking about the diagnostic.

631
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,430
- I'm talking about us.
- "Us"?

632
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:38,642
Your interest in me--
it's inappropriate.

633
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,394
I don't think I understand.

634
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:44,147
It's obvious you desire
a romantic involvement.

635
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:45,690
Excuse me?

636
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,567
You've made all
the customary overtures--

637
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:49,736
finding reasons
to spend time with me,

638
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:51,279
complimenting me,

639
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:54,616
inviting me to engage
in recreational activities.

640
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,869
Your husband even challenged me
to a ritual contest.

641
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,579
What are you talking about?

642
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:02,374
According to my research,
it's a traditional Klingon practice.

643
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:06,586
Look... I'm sorry,
but you've got the wrong idea.

644
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,463
You seemed a little lonely.

645
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,799
I was just trying to be friendly.

646
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,051
- I scanned you.
- You scanned me?

647
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,177
In the Jefferies tube.

648
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:16,388
Your blood pressure
and neurotransmitter readings

649
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,431
indicated a state of arousal.

650
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:21,893
It was hot, and I've been
under a lot of pressure,

651
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:24,396
but I certainly
wasn't aroused.

652
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,942
Look, Icheb, I like you...

653
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:34,072
but aside from the fact
that I am a much older woman,

654
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,240
I'm married.

655
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,826
That's why we have to do
the honorable thing.

656
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,996
We should stop seeing each other.

657
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,293
You're right.

658
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:52,674
As much as it hurts,
I'll just have to face the truth.

659
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,593
It's for the best.

660
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,011
Mm.

661
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,485
[quietly]
Seven?

662
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:15,530
Feeling better?

663
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,617
Well enough to return to duty.

664
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,995
You won't be returning to duty,
not on this ship anyway.

665
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,415
Loken lied to us.

666
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,541
There's no vaccine.

667
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,169
The cloak is the real cargo.

668
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:33,882
I ordered the crew to take us
back to Voyager, but they refused.

669
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,426
They mutinied.

670
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,428
I guess that's what you'd call it.

671
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,640
I've packed some supplies.

672
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:42,891
We'll take an escape pod.

673
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,560
I'm hoping the Annari
will leave us alone,

674
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:46,811
treat us as neutral parties.

675
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:49,022
We're not "neutral parties."

676
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,650
This is a military mission.
We can't get involved.

677
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:54,694
We've been "involved" since
you first fired on that Annari ship.

678
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:57,155
I thought I was helping people
in distress.

679
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,032
Don't they still need your help?

680
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,117
Are you abandoning this ship

681
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:03,286
because the mission
wasn't what you expected

682
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,247
or because being a Captain
wasn't what you expected?

683
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,250
I am perfectly capable
of commanding a starship.

684
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,669
Are you?

685
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:12,504
Clearly, you're uncomfortable
with the role--

686
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,339
delegating tasks, giving orders.

687
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,257
Someone died
following my orders!

688
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,134
You can't blame yourself
for that.

689
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:20,553
A Captain's responsible
for the lives of his crew.

690
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:25,100
People sometimes die on missions,
despite the Captain's best efforts.

691
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,436
I should have stuck
to playing Buster Kincaid.

692
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:33,066
A holodeck program can be turned off
when it no longer suits you.

693
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,901
Reality can't.

694
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:42,492
If you really feel responsible
for this crew,

695
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,120
you'll help them get home,

696
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,664
because they won't survive
without you.

697
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:55,630
Is that some new kind
of weapon?

698
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:59,175
They're scanning pulses
designed to illuminate cloaked ships.

699
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:01,469
If we hit one,
we'll be exposed.

700
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,054
How are we going
to get through?

701
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,347
We'll find a way.

702
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:07,267
I thought you were leaving.

703
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,228
I get claustrophobic
in escape pods.

704
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:13,106
Switch to manual helm control.
Full power to shields.

705
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:18,194
Aye, Captain.

706
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,868
[sighs]

707
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,503
Two Annari ships
have entered orbit.

708
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,088
- They are hailing.
- On screen.

709
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:40,842
Captain Geral, we have
12 isotons of ore for you.

710
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,845
I'm under orders to escort you
out of Annari space,

711
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,430
immediately.

712
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,015
You've been
supporting our enemy.

713
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,433
You must be mistaken.

714
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,977
A shuttlecraft
matching your hull composition

715
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,772
fired on one of our ships
several days ago.

716
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,857
And we recently detected
two human bio-signatures

717
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,859
on a Kraylor warship.

718
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,944
- I can explain that.
- If you don't leave immediately,

719
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:01,863
we'll be forced to fire on you.

720
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,449
Our warp drive
is still being repaired.

721
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,493
Then we'll escort you at impulse.

722
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:09,496
You have five minutes
to lift off.

723
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:13,500
So much for our new
deuterium injectors.

724
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,335
What about Harry and Seven?

725
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,544
[Janeway]
We'll go looking for them,

726
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:19,297
as soon as we get rid
of our escort.

727
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,515
Evasive maneuvers.

728
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,310
- There are too many of them.
- You're doing fine.

729
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,230
Just try to stay at least 100 meters
ahead of the closest pulse.

730
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,523
Yes, sir.

731
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,651
We should return fire.

732
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:43,154
No, that would only give them
another way to triangulate our position.

733
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,827
Our shields are failing.

734
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,496
We're losing structural integrity
on the lower decks.

735
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,248
Reroute emergency power.

736
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,500
It's insufficient.

737
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,169
Open a channel
to the lead Annari ship.

738
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,255
- Sir?
- Do it.

739
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,716
Aye, sir.

740
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,930
This is Captain Kim of
the Kraylor Vessel Nightingale.

741
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,474
I'm prepared to discuss terms
for our surrender.

742
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:13,893
End transmission.

743
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,854
We trusted you.

744
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,272
And you still should.

745
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,439
They're responding.

746
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,901
I don't have time to explain.
On screen.

747
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:25,780
Your surrender
will be unconditional.

748
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,323
No, it won't.

749
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:29,909
Either you allow my crew
to evacuate to the surface,

750
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,828
or I'll put this ship
on self-destruct.

751
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,539
You'll never get
the cloaking technology.

752
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,625
Something tells me your superiors
won't be happy about that.

753
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:41,129
Your crew will be taken
aboard my vessel

754
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,964
and brought
to an Annari detention center.

755
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,508
My crew is going to the surface
in escape pods.

756
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:49,429
Once they're clear, you can lock on
to this ship with a tractor beam.

757
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:52,473
Agreed.

758
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,475
You've two minutes to evacuate.

759
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,604
I will not abandon this ship.

760
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:01,482
I'm glad to hear that,
because I'm going to need you here.

761
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,776
Get your people into
the pods... quickly.

762
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,028
But the cloak...

763
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,696
I've got a plan to save it.

764
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,198
If I fail, at least
the scientist who designed it

765
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:10,992
will be alive
to create another one.

766
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,876
Seven, scan the Annari's
tractor emitters.

767
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,128
I need to know
the exact beam polarity.

768
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,880
What are we going to do?

769
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,925
Once they lock on to us,
they're going to come about

770
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:28,426
and pull us away
from the planet.

771
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,802
As soon as they do,

772
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,679
we're going to reverse
our shield polarity.

773
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:34,307
If we time it right, it should
give us enough momentum

774
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,267
to outrun them
to the defense perimeter.

775
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,645
We're going to use their
own weapons against them?

776
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:40,063
The escape pods are away.

777
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,110
[sighs]

778
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,363
Disengage the cloak.

779
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,700
They've locked on.

780
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,037
Sir?

781
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,163
Not yet.

782
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,082
Steady.

783
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:02,168
Now!

784
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:08,925
Status?

785
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,343
Shields are failing.

786
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,387
Four Annari vessels
are in pursuit.

787
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,180
- They're closing.
- Full thrusters!

788
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:15,932
[alarm bleeping]

789
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,393
Shields are down.

790
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,436
Get us through that defense
perimeter, Mr. Terek.

791
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,938
Yes, sir.

792
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:31,114
We're inside.

793
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,492
The Annari have
broken off their pursuit.

794
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,330
Take us to the surface,
Mr. Terek.

795
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,386
We've just crossed out
of Annari space.

796
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,763
Our escorts have broken off.
They're going to warp.

797
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,432
Bring the long-range sensors
on line.

798
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,933
You and Tom, take the Flyer.

799
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:01,519
Start your search
at Harry's last known position.

800
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:04,313
Tuvok, send an encrypted message
to the Kraylor homeworld.

801
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:06,858
See if they know
where Harry and Seven are.

802
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,443
That won't be necessary,
Captain.

803
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,403
Ensign Kim is hailing us.

804
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:11,529
From where?

805
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,406
A cloaked vessel.

806
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,699
It's directly astern.

807
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:21,664
[Kim] <i>Acting Captain's Personal Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 54282.5.</i>

808
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:22,999
<i>Final entry.</i>

809
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,877
<i>New cloaking systems are being</i>
<i>installed in other Kraylor ships,</i>

810
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,254
<i>so I guess the mission</i>
<i>was a success.</i>

811
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:30,882
<i>Still, I wish</i>
<i>I felt better about it.</i>

812
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,302
Welcome home.

813
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:36,554
It's good to be back.

814
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,475
So, what'll it be tonight?

815
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,602
I have a light
Tula cheese soufflé

816
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:43,895
or a zesty lasagna.

817
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,648
You know, Neelix,
the truth is, I'm not sure.

818
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,734
I thought
we talked about this.

819
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:53,905
- A Captain has to be deci...
- I'm not a Captain, Neelix.

820
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:59,285
Not yet, anyway.
