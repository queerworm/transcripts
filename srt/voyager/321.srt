1
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:03,253
DOCTOR:<i> Activate</i>
<i>the bio-temporal chamber.</i>

2
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,926
Is she going
to be all right?

3
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:10,636
Not if you don't all
clear out of here

4
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:12,053
and let me
do my work.

5
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:13,848
She's my mother.
I'm staying.

6
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:15,349
This is a very
delicate procedure

7
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,434
and I could use
some peace and quiet.

8
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,436
PARIS:
The Doctor's right.

9
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,938
Let's let him
do his work.

10
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:22,898
All right.

11
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:26,443
( labored breathing )

12
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:30,656
( door opens, closes )

13
00:00:32,992 --> 00:00:35,160
I wish I'd told you this before,

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,913
but better late than never.

15
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:40,916
You're the finest friend
I've ever had.

16
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:44,461
Prepare to bring the
bio-temporal chamber on line.

17
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,630
We'll begin in approximately
five minutes.

18
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,639
Grandma, are you awake?

19
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:02,021
I brought you a present.

20
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:04,398
Grandma Kes?

21
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,662
<i>( dramatic</i>
<i>theme music playing )</i>

22
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,723
I finally finished making
your birthday present.

23
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,684
Sorry it's late,

24
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,061
but I wanted
to get it right.

25
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:09,356
I... I don't know you.

26
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,190
What do you mean?

27
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,568
I'm Andrew...

28
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,445
your grandson.

29
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:18,949
I don't know you.

30
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,827
Doctor.
Dr. van Gogh.

31
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,454
What is it?

32
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,456
She doesn't
recognize me.

33
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,542
Kes?

34
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,460
How are you feeling?

35
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,461
Where am I?

36
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,796
What is this place?

37
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,383
You're in Sick Bay.

38
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,135
Do you know who I am?

39
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,636
No.

40
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,519
Yes.

41
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,481
I've seen you before.

42
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,274
Do you know my name?

43
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:58,197
The boy, he called you
Dr. van Gogh.

44
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,992
That's right.

45
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,959
You said
I was your finest friend.

46
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,714
Well... I'm not sure
I've ever said that exactly,

47
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:19,426
but... that doesn't mean
it's not true.

48
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,803
How could I be your friend?

49
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,513
I don't know you.

50
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,850
Tell me what you do remember.

51
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:33,982
Uh, people around me,
crowded around me.

52
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,818
You, a boy, a young girl.

53
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,240
I was in a chamber...

54
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,619
A bio-temporal chamber.

55
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,454
Good.

56
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,665
I was inside it and you told
someone to activate it.

57
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,919
I'm afraid you're confused.

58
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,213
I discussed the bio-temporal
chamber with you,

59
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:59,216
but we're not ready
to put you inside it just yet.

60
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:03,887
Can you recall anything else
besides those people you saw?

61
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,597
Anything else about your life?

62
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,602
No.

63
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,193
Go find the rest
of your family.

64
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,614
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

65
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:23,991
What's the big hurry?

66
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,366
I'm sorry, Captain.

67
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,743
I have to go.

68
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,580
What was that
all about?

69
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,457
I'm afraid Kes is
getting worse, Captain.

70
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,043
Her amnesia
is near total.

71
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,544
Fewer than one percent
of her engrams

72
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,963
remained intact.

73
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,547
It's as if her memory
were wiped clean.

74
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,382
Is it some sort
of senility?

75
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,676
Maybe. I've
never treated

76
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,427
a nine-year-old
Ocampan before.

77
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,096
For all I know,

78
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,598
it's a perfectly normal part
of their aging process.

79
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,349
It's hard to believe
that she performed

80
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,853
microsurgery on my elbow
just a few weeks ago.

81
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,813
A few weeks ago,
she was a healthy woman,

82
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,107
but this<i> morilogium</i>
comes on abruptly

83
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,441
and then progresses

84
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,694
with a rapidity
I've never seen before.

85
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,820
How are you
coming along

86
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,114
with the bio-temporal
chamber?

87
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:07,534
As I told you, it's a completely
revolutionary procedure.

88
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,328
I have no idea
if it'll work.

89
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:10,996
Under normal circumstances,

90
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,957
I'd want to perform extensive
tests on the apparatus,

91
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,583
but we're losing her
too fast.

92
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,627
If I don't try it now,
it may be too late.

93
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,587
If you really believe
it will prolong her life...

94
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,299
If we're lucky, it may
buy her another year.

95
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,051
I think you have
the family's consent.

96
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,635
You should go ahead
and do it.

97
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,803
KES:
I'm so cold.

98
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,351
I'm cold.

99
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:33,727
No wonder.

100
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,520
Your temperature
has dropped to 14.8--

101
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,314
almost two degrees
below normal.

102
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:38,732
What does
that mean?

103
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,025
I'm not sure.

104
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,609
What?

105
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,737
Her cells are in a state
of bio-temporal flux.

106
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,655
I don't understand
how that could be happening

107
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,406
<i>before</i> I put her
in the chamber.

108
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,450
KES:
I'm cold.

109
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,370
( gasps )

110
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,633
( sighs )

111
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,753
ANDREW:
Look, Mom, I'm almost finished
with Grandma's present.

112
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,838
WOMAN:
It's wonderful, sweetheart.

113
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,591
I'm sure Grandma will think
it was well worth the wait.

114
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,176
ANDREW:
I hope so.

115
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,552
I still feel bad

116
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,055
about not having it ready
in time for her party.

117
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,808
Hello.

118
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,017
How was your nap?

119
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:58,853
Andrew?

120
00:07:58,853 --> 00:07:59,896
Grandma,
don't look.

121
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,689
You'll ruin
the surprise.

122
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,609
Why don't you sit down?
I'll get you some tea.

123
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,656
Where am I?

124
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,283
In your quarters.

125
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:12,742
What quarters?

126
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,579
Aboard<i> Voyager.</i>

127
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,872
What's wrong?

128
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,792
I don't know who you are.

129
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,672
But you...

130
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,715
I know who you are.

131
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,760
Tell me what's happening.

132
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,387
How did I
get here?

133
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,348
Andrew, get your
grandfather and father.

134
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,516
Tell them to meet us
in Sick Bay.

135
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,978
Yes... Sick Bay.

136
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,188
I remember that place.

137
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,439
I was just there.

138
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,360
Uh, when?

139
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,112
Just a few minutes ago.

140
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:53,992
Dr. van Gogh
asked me some questions.

141
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,744
I couldn't remember
anything.

142
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,958
You haven't been to Sick
Bay for over a week--

143
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,918
since you stopped
working there.

144
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,505
Working?

145
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:07,506
What kind of work?

146
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,049
Don't you
remember?

147
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,509
You were one of
the ship's doctors.

148
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:11,885
I worked there with you.

149
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,513
Who are you?

150
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:17,516
I'm your daughter...

151
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,017
Linnis.

152
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,729
But I don't remember you.

153
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,440
Do you remember
anything at all?

154
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,985
Just people
crowded around me...

155
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,070
voices...

156
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,282
The Doctor told
everyone to leave

157
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,825
and then he told
someone else

158
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,245
to activate
the bio-temporal chamber.

159
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,620
He's been working
on that.

160
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,997
He may have
mentioned it to you.

161
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,165
And then I woke up

162
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,751
and there was a boy,
Andrew,

163
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,337
standing over me
with a present...

164
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,256
calling me Grandma.

165
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:52,008
But Andrew hasn't finished
your present yet.

166
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,343
You just saw him
still working on it

167
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,677
in your quarters.

168
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,305
But he was there.

169
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,808
The Doctor sent him
to get my family,

170
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,061
and I was cold,
and I woke up in that bed

171
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,020
in the quarters and...

172
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,147
Maybe you
were dreaming.

173
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,648
( sighs )

174
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,818
I... I don't think so.

175
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,196
Well, none of the things
that you remember

176
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,323
before waking from your nap
have happened.

177
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,117
How do you know?

178
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,410
Listen to me, Mother.

179
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,994
You're confused right now,

180
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,289
and I'm sure
that's very frightening.

181
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,874
But you need to trust me.

182
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,085
I'm your daughter
and I love you.

183
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,795
Now, please, come with me.

184
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,130
Come.

185
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,176
I've been
expecting this.

186
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,388
The onset of<i> morilogium.</i>

187
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:41,475
She's lost more than 98 percent
of her memory engrams.

188
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,435
<i>Morilogium?</i>

189
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:44,561
The final phase

190
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,105
of the Ocampan life-span,
Mother.

191
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,608
Are you saying
that I'm dying?

192
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:51,401
Not if I
can help it.

193
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,320
What do you mean?

194
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:58,241
Kes, it's me, Tom.

195
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:01,578
Your husband.

196
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,831
Tom.

197
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,833
We're losing her.

198
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,170
How long?

199
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,797
If we do nothing,
a matter of weeks.

200
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:16,050
But I'm working on something
to extend her life-span.

201
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,136
It involves treating her
with a bio-temporal field

202
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,846
in order to push
her cells back

203
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,056
to an earlier stage
of entropic decay.

204
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,350
It's highly experimental,

205
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,519
but if it works,
it might buy her some time.

206
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,479
No. My mother's
always accepted

207
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,356
that she would
only live nine years.

208
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,232
If she's reaching
the natural end of her life,

209
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,235
she wouldn't want extraordinary
measures taken to extend it,

210
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,029
especially not in the state
she's in now.

211
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,864
If the Doctor has a way
to keep your mother with us,

212
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,158
even for one more day,
we have to let him try.

213
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,577
We're not talking about
a tested medical procedure here.

214
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,371
We're talking about
a radical experiment.

215
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,248
Sweetheart, I understand
how upsetting this is.

216
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,125
But if it were you
on that bio-bed,

217
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,751
I'd feel just like Tom does.

218
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,129
KES: Everyone, listen
to me, please.

219
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,589
LINNIS:
Yes, listen to her.

220
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,799
Mother, tell us
what you want.

221
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,301
I want to know
what's going on here.

222
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,178
Maybe the<i> morilogium</i>
is causing my amnesia,

223
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,846
but that doesn't explain

224
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,516
how I seem to suddenly jump
from Sick Bay to my quarters,

225
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:08,228
or how I remember being
in a bio-temporal chamber.

226
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,564
Kes, it's possible
the<i> morilogium</i>

227
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,190
is causing you
to experience delusions.

228
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,567
No, they're not
delusions!

229
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:14,526
I want you to lie down.

230
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:15,569
No.

231
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:16,819
Leave her alone.

232
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,196
Your grandmother's
very sick, son.

233
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,198
Maybe, but she's
not delusional.

234
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,033
She's the smartest
person I know.

235
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,368
We should listen
to her.

236
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,744
Oh, I'm cold.

237
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,168
Her body temperature
has dropped 2.7 degrees.

238
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,171
ALL: ♪ ...For she's
A jolly good fellow ♪

239
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,007
♪ For she's
A jolly good fellow ♪

240
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:42,596
♪ For she's a jolly good
Fellow ♪

241
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:45,848
♪ Which nobody
Can deny ♪♪

242
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,184
Happy ninth, Kes.

243
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,311
Well, go ahead.
Make a wish.

244
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,528
Well, what are
you waiting for?

245
00:12:58,528 --> 00:12:59,987
Blow out the candles.

246
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:08,079
It's good to see that old lung
is still working, Kessy.

247
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,998
Happy birthday,
sweetheart.

248
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:16,963
Why, you know, I haven't
made one of these

249
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,674
since... well, since
I became Security Officer.

250
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,760
Perhaps you would care
to relinquish your commission

251
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,803
and return to the scene
of your former triumphs.

252
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,431
You keep working

253
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,391
on that sense of humor,
Commander Vulcan.

254
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,644
You'll get it
one of these days.

255
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,147
Jimbalian fudge--
your favorite.

256
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,232
Some of us ought to be
watching our calories,

257
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,610
but after all, it is
a special occasion.

258
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:40,903
Andrew.

259
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,618
I'm sorry I don't have
a present for you, Grandma.

260
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:49,329
I've got an idea
for something special

261
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,622
I'm going to make,
but I've been

262
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:51,998
too busy with
schoolwork.

263
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,291
I haven't had
a chance to start it.

264
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,627
I think it'll be
worth the wait.

265
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:57,337
Come and talk to Grandma
for a minute, will you?

266
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,630
Sure.

267
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,089
I'm going to ask
you a few questions

268
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,591
and I want you
to think very carefully

269
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,551
before you answer them,
all right?

270
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,345
I always think
before I speak.

271
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,221
You taught me that.

272
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,183
Where were you before you
came to this party?

273
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,727
At my physics lesson
in Engineering.

274
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,062
And then you came
directly here?

275
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,148
No. I stopped at
your quarters to get you.

276
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,733
Don't you remember?

277
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,819
Andrew, stop monopolizing
your grandmother's time.

278
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:22,570
There are other people
who'd would like to wish her

279
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,863
a happy birthday,
you know.

280
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,906
She's all
yours, Doctor.

281
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,951
Excuse me.
That cake looks great.

282
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,578
It's amazing to think

283
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,038
that you weren't
even a year old

284
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,498
when we first met.

285
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,041
Not much older
than Andrew.

286
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,251
Doctor, there's
something wrong with me.

287
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,628
What is it?

288
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:39,838
Promise to hear me out

289
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,548
and not assume
I'm delusional.

290
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,758
Why do you think I'd ever
make such an assumption?

291
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,635
Promise.
Of course.

292
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,303
I've lost all
but a few of my memories,

293
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,638
and the memories
I do have

294
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,306
don't coincide
with anyone else's.

295
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,559
Can you be
more specific?

296
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,811
Well, I was in Sick Bay

297
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:58,272
and you and a woman,
my daughter,

298
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:02,318
were arguing about
prolonging my life,

299
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,529
and then I suddenly
appeared in my quarters,

300
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:05,946
and then I simply
appeared here.

301
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,366
As far as I know,
none of that happened.

302
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,201
Is it possible
you were dreaming?

303
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,537
No. I was awake.
I'm sure of it.

304
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,664
But nobody else remembers
the things I do.

305
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:18,292
I hate to say this,
but... it's possible

306
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,712
that these strange experiences
you're having

307
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:23,339
are related to the onset
of the<i> morilogium.</i>

308
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,467
You talked about that.
You wanted to put me

309
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,554
in a bio-temporal chamber
to stop my aging process.

310
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,472
How could you possibly
know about that?

311
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,015
Because you told me.

312
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,559
I only came up
with the idea

313
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,853
for the bio-temporal chamber
this morning.

314
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,605
I was going to
tell you about it today,

315
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,357
here, at the party as a sort of
birthday surprise.

316
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,818
If that were true, then how
could I already know about it?

317
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:47,447
I don't know,
but we'd better get you

318
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,699
to Sick Bay
and find out.

319
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:52,744
She appears to have lost
more than 95 percent

320
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,621
of her memory engrams.

321
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,497
Is that symptomatic
of the<i> morilogium?</i>

322
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,665
I don't know.

323
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,999
I have no basis
for comparison.

324
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,794
No other Ocampans
on board.

325
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,378
Don't worry.

326
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,713
We'll get to the
bottom of this.

327
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,214
I do have memories.

328
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,925
They just don't coincide
with anyone else's.

329
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:09,135
First, Andrew gave me
a belated birthday present.

330
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,095
Then, he said he was
working on the present.

331
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,181
And now he just apologized
for not starting it yet.

332
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,183
It's almost as if
you're experiencing

333
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,060
events in reverse.

334
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,814
Maybe there's some kind
of time paradox at work.

335
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,356
There is another
possibility.

336
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,066
Given that Kes
has knowledge

337
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,653
of a treatment I have not
yet devised, it's possible

338
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,780
she's developed some
sort of precognition.

339
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,282
Are you saying I can see
into the future?

340
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,659
Well, you've
demonstrated some

341
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,577
pretty extraordinary
mental powers

342
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,079
over the years--
telepathy, telekinesis.

343
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,749
And precognition wouldn't
be unprecedented.

344
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,209
Some species, including the
Yattho of the Beta Quadrant,

345
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,711
have been known to
predict future events

346
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,296
with uncanny accuracy.

347
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,715
See if you can confirm this
theory about precognition.

348
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,133
In the meantime,
Tom and I will begin

349
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,218
scanning
for temporal anomalies.

350
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,513
We'll do everything
we can to help you.

351
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,139
I'd like to do something
to help myself.

352
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,808
What did you
have in mind?

353
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,852
Well, I seem to have lived
quite a full life on this ship.

354
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,394
Maybe if I had a look
at my medical files

355
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,480
or checked other records
of my activities,

356
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,899
I might be able
to fill in some of the blanks.

357
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,943
Well, you may have lost
your memories,

358
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,987
but you certainly haven't
lost your determination.

359
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,462
Hi.

360
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,548
Oh, hello.

361
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,050
How's it coming?

362
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,426
I've had a busy life.

363
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,345
It's hard to know
where to start.

364
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,263
How about you?

365
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,516
Well, we've tried
every kind of temporal scan

366
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:39,976
Harry could think of,

367
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,769
but we still haven't
been able to find anything

368
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,855
to explain what's
been happening to you.

369
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,860
Your initial physical exam.

370
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,945
I remember
when you came on board.

371
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:53,531
I had a crush on you
right from the beginning.

372
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,867
I tried to hide it,
but Neelix sensed it

373
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,911
and, boy, was
he ever jealous.

374
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,204
Neelix?

375
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,831
You don't remember?

376
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,208
( sighs )
You and he were

377
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,586
involved for quite a while.

378
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,462
( clears throat )

379
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,506
Oh, one of your
prenatal exams.

380
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,717
When we listened
to Linnis's heartbeat.

381
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:15,053
That was quite a day.

382
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,932
What about this?

383
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,434
It says I got some kind
of radiation poisoning

384
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:24,812
on stardate 50973.

385
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,898
That was
the beginning

386
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:29,275
of the Year of Hell.

387
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,818
"Year of Hell"?

388
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,112
Well, that's what some of us
call it now.

389
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,448
We were
under virtually constant attack

390
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,199
by a race called the Krenim.

391
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,118
The ship almost didn't make it.

392
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,287
The Doctor was off-line
for months,

393
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,997
and we lost
a lot of good people--

394
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:47,668
Captain Janeway,
Joe Carey... B'Elanna.

395
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,588
B'Elanna?

396
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,135
I keep forgetting that you
don't remember any of them.

397
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,473
B'Elanna was...

398
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,893
someone
who was very special to me.

399
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,188
When she died,

400
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:11,025
I felt like
I wanted to die, too.

401
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,320
But you...

402
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,115
you helped me
through it.

403
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,282
I'm sorry.

404
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,868
No.
No. It's my fault.

405
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:24,538
You haven't done
anything wrong. It's just...

406
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,874
You don't remember
any of our life together?

407
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,796
Well, that's all right.

408
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,050
I've got enough feelings
for both of us.

409
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,762
Maybe the feelings
I had for you will come back.

410
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,644
You were asking

411
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:47,895
about the radiation
poisoning.

412
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,438
A lot of us
were exposed.

413
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,440
During the first
Krenim attack,

414
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,900
one of the chroniton
torpedo fragments

415
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,777
leaked radiation into the ship.

416
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,114
Chroniton torpedoes?

417
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,949
They were able to
penetrate our shields

418
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,241
because their torpedoes

419
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:04,787
were in a constant state
of temporal flux.

420
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,789
Wait a minute...

421
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:09,542
I think we may be
onto something.

422
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,544
We'd better go talk
to the Doctor.

423
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,587
Come on.

424
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,506
If I was infected with
these chroniton particles,

425
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,591
there might be a connection
to what's happening to me now.

426
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,968
Exactly.

427
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,553
Maybe we should try
scanning for residual...

428
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:25,099
KIM:
Say cheese.

429
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:28,561
Oh...

430
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,819
I think he's got
your nose, Mother.

431
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:39,238
So how does it feel
to be a grandfather?

432
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,782
A lot better than it does
to have you for a son-in-law.

433
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,327
What's the date?

434
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,829
The date?

435
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,247
Yes. The stardate.

436
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,792
It's 56947. Why?

437
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,378
Over six months.

438
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,629
Mother, what's going on?

439
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,762
Tom, we have to
talk to the Doctor.

440
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:03,846
Come on.

441
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,558
As far as I can tell,
I've jumped backwards

442
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,227
a total of five times
so far.

443
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:11,478
Is there any discernible
pattern to these jumps?

444
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,731
No. They're
apparently random.

445
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:16,275
Uh, one time it seemed
to span for a few weeks

446
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,360
and the last
was half a year.

447
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,988
Each time I arrive, I seem
to exist in temporal sync

448
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,823
with the rest of you
for a while,

449
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,825
but before I can make anyone
understand what's happening,

450
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,620
I find myself
at an earlier time in my life,

451
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,872
and just before it happens,
I seem to experience

452
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,874
a sudden drop
in body temperature.

453
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,251
( beeping )

454
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:34,460
Hm...

455
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,336
Now, this could explain
a thing or two.

456
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,755
What is it?

457
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,757
I'm detecting high-level
chroniton radiation

458
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,092
in your cells.

459
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:42,843
So I was right.

460
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:43,844
There is a connection.

461
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,221
But Kes was
inoculated

462
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,513
along with the
rest of the crew

463
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,723
over three years ago.

464
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,267
Yes, however, everyone was left

465
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:51,769
with trace amounts of the
radiation in their bodies.

466
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:54,855
For some reason,
those residual chronitons

467
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,398
have reactivated in Kes.

468
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,441
Why?

469
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,567
The bio-temporal chamber.

470
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,069
My thinking exactly.

471
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,071
Would you two
mind explaining?

472
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,739
It's really quite
obvious, Lieutenant.

473
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,909
Your wife is traveling
backward through time.

474
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,586
It's as though
I came into existence

475
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,338
at the moment
of my own death

476
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,923
without any memories.

477
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,134
I've been living my life
backwards ever since--

478
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:25,970
jumping progressively
to earlier moments in my life,

479
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,682
accumulating memories
and experiences as I go.

480
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:32,268
Your past has become
my future.

481
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:35,271
Doctor, any theory about
what's causing this?

482
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:39,025
In approximately six months,
I will apparently expose Kes

483
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,901
to some type
of bio-temporal field

484
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:44,030
in a highly experimental, but
nonetheless brilliant attempt

485
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,572
to stop her aging process.

486
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,033
And it's this attempt

487
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,909
which leads
to Kes's current predicament?

488
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,453
What I will, apparently,
fail to realize

489
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,831
is that the bio-temporal field
is going to reactivate

490
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:56,250
the dormant chroniton particles
in her cells,

491
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,045
bringing Kes out of temporal
sync with the rest of us.

492
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,504
Is there any way
to stop Kes

493
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,131
from continuing
these jumps?

494
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:04,800
Yes. Purge her completely
of the chroniton poisoning.

495
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,384
KIM: To do that,
we'd need to know

496
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:07,970
the precise
temporal variance

497
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,056
of the specific torpedo
which contaminated the ship.

498
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:12,683
Tactical sensors were not
functioning at the time.

499
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:16,020
There is no data regarding
the torpedo in question.

500
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,147
PARIS: Let me get one
thing straight, Doc.

501
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,358
Is it possible, if this
keeps happening to Kes

502
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:22,735
that she might actually
jump back into a time

503
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,570
before she
knew any of us?

504
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,072
DOCTOR: Worse than that,
Mr. Paris.

505
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,865
It's possible she may
eventually jump back

506
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:31,493
to a time...
before she even existed.

507
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:42,671
CHAKOTAY:<i> Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 55836.2.</i>

508
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,882
<i>Kes has remained</i>
<i>in temporal sync with us</i>

509
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:46,592
<i>for two days now,</i>

510
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,426
<i>but since we don't know</i>
<i>when she may jump again,</i>

511
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:49,887
<i>we can't afford to rest</i>

512
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:52,181
<i>until we've found some way</i>
<i>to help her.</i>

513
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,725
I'm going to try running
a hypothalamic scan.

514
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,019
Maybe we can
establish a pattern

515
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,812
to the drops in your
body temperature.

516
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,480
You're very good
at this, aren't you?

517
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,858
I had a very good teacher.

518
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,360
Doctor van Gogh?

519
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,070
You.

520
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,988
I'm sorry. All this
must be taking you

521
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,615
away from your baby
just now.

522
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:12,785
You must be wanting to spend
every second with him.

523
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,997
Actually, I feel a little
awkward around him sometimes.

524
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,958
Harry's always

525
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:22,711
singing to him
and playing with him, but...

526
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,214
Well, I seem to be
much more comfortable

527
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,967
with a molecular scanner
than I am with a diaper.

528
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,635
Oh, Linnis,
I don't think that...

529
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:32,179
Kes, I may have found a way
to prevent your next jump.

530
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,348
I've erected a containment field
that may keep you here.

531
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,225
It's going to require
your confinement in Sick Bay.

532
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,851
I'll keep working here.

533
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:41,314
Linnis... you must
be a good mother.

534
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:42,898
I happen to know
that Andrew grows up

535
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,650
to be a wonderful child.

536
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:01,041
Hello, Tom.

537
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,919
I thought... maybe you
could use some company.

538
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,671
I feel like I'm in a cage.

539
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,131
Dr. van Gogh says...

540
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:08,632
Dr. "van Gogh"?

541
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,634
I thought you
settled on "Mozart."

542
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,428
Evidently, my interest

543
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,221
in the great figures
of art and culture

544
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,307
will be an ongoing process.

545
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:18,558
Well...

546
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:19,893
"Vincent", uh...

547
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,895
how about letting me
inside this thing?

548
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,689
I'm afraid that wouldn't
be advisable.

549
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:29,320
( sighing ):
Okay, then...

550
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,489
How about another
installment of

551
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:33,740
<i>Tom and Kes:</i>
<i>The Early Years?</i>

552
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,410
I'd enjoy that.

553
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,245
Um...

554
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,831
Well, there was, uh,
our wedding reception.

555
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,666
Harry was my best man.

556
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,502
Heh. He...
He got so nervous

557
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:46,170
when he stood up
to give the toast

558
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,298
that he spilled champagne
all over my dress uniform.

559
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:51,549
( laughing )

560
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:53,135
What is it?

561
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,680
At the time,

562
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,141
I thought that was
the happiest day of my life...

563
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:04,021
but every day
just got better and better.

564
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:06,857
It means so much
to have you here now.

565
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,610
( door opens )

566
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,862
I think I may have
found something.

567
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:12,905
What is it?

568
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,407
Well, I was
studying the effects

569
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:15,782
of the chronitons on
other crew members and I...

570
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:16,867
( alarm sounding )

571
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,660
PARIS:
What's that?

572
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,830
Kes' temperature
has dropped 1.9 degrees.

573
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,374
Linnis, monitor
the containment field.

574
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:24,917
I'm going to try to elevate
her temperature.

575
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,182
Her temperature's
still dropping.

576
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:41,434
We're losing containment.

577
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:43,352
Increase the field
amplitude.

578
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:44,478
Kes...?

579
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:45,603
It's not working.

580
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:46,813
DOCTOR:
We're losing her.

581
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,690
Set field polarization
to maximum!

582
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,957
Do something!

583
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,417
( panting )

584
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:08,294
The sac is opening...

585
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:09,627
What's happening?

586
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:11,088
What do you mean,
"What's happening?"

587
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:12,630
You're having a baby.
Now, hold still.

588
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,840
Where am I?

589
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,842
Exactly where I told you
not to be--

590
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:16,885
on a shuttlecraft.

591
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,012
I have to see the Doctor.

592
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,348
Well, that'd be nice
if he were still around.

593
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,600
( moans )

594
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,268
I told you,
you were in no condition

595
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:26,604
to come on a supply mission,
but did you listen to me?

596
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:27,771
( cries out )

597
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,356
( panting )

598
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,108
I can see the toes...

599
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,109
( grunting )

600
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:33,444
It's coming...

601
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:36,322
Kes...

602
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,700
Oh, it's a girl.

603
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,412
( baby crying )

604
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:46,039
Oh...

605
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,500
Linnis.

606
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,834
Shh...

607
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:51,044
She's beautiful.

608
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,505
Yes, she is.

609
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:57,301
Yes, just like
her mother.

610
00:27:57,301 --> 00:28:01,555
Tom, listen.

611
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:04,433
I love you, Kes.

612
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,935
We need to talk.

613
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,562
( beeping )

614
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:09,687
Just a minute.

615
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,023
But...

616
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,152
What is it?

617
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:17,237
<i>Voyager's</i> under attack.

618
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:21,741
<i>( tense dramatic</i>
<i>score playing )</i>

619
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,706
Congratulations.
Thanks.

620
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:31,335
But it looks like the
celebration'll have to wait.

621
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,422
I'll get Kes and the baby
to the Mess Hall.

622
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,550
Captain Chakotay wants you
to go to the weapons array

623
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,426
and modulate
the targeting scanners

624
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,595
to a parametric
frequency.

625
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:42,762
He's going to try
to knock out

626
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:43,847
the chroniton
torpedo launchers

627
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,182
before they're fired.

628
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:46,766
Chroniton torpedoes--
the "Year of Hell."

629
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,227
What?

630
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,562
You told me that the crew
referred to this time

631
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:50,563
as the "Year of Hell."

632
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:51,813
When did I tell
you that?

633
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:52,814
It's a long story.

634
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,400
( baby crying )

635
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,859
You'll have to
tell me later.

636
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,236
I've got to get to
the weapons array.

637
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,029
Neelix, get her
to lie down, will you?

638
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,780
Neelix, listen
very carefully.

639
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,658
There's something important
I have to tell you.

640
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,748
( baby crying )

641
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:15,170
Neelix told us what's been
happening to you, Kes.

642
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,672
How are you holding up?

643
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,590
We're both fine.

644
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,258
It's quite
a story.

645
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,635
Just before the last jump,
we were close to a solution.

646
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:22,761
The Doctor was working on...

647
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,803
The Doctor?

648
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,138
Well, it's good to know

649
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,473
we'll eventually
get him back on line.

650
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,933
"Eventually"
may be too late.

651
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,560
We've got
to help Kes now.

652
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,186
We discovered that what's
been happening to me

653
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,854
is related
to the chroniton poisoning

654
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,814
I suffered during
a Krenim attack.

655
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,567
We have to determine
the exact temporal variance

656
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,026
of the torpedo, so that we...

657
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,696
The main computer's
been off-line for weeks.

658
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:42,531
Even if the sensor logs
contain that information,

659
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:43,907
we can't access them.

660
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,287
You have to put me in the
bio-temporal containment field.

661
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,581
I know it didn't work last time,
but with a few modifications...

662
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:52,708
We've only got life-support
on three out of 14 decks.

663
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,501
And we've had to divert
all remaining power

664
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,962
to knock out the Krenim's
torpedo launchers.

665
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,505
We don't even have
a Sick Bay anymore,

666
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,715
much less the resources

667
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,675
to create a bio-
containment field.

668
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:03,009
I'm sorry.

669
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,928
We've got to do
something to help her.

670
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,138
I'm open to
suggestions.

671
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,765
I'm cold.

672
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:09,015
I'll get you a blanket.

673
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,017
No. You don't
understand.

674
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,394
I'm abou...

675
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:13,771
I'm about...

676
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:15,981

677
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:23,572

678
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:24,990
Hey, Kes.

679
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,199
Some party, huh?

680
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,826
I have to talk to you.

682
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,287
I'm sorry I'm late.

You must be B'Elanna.

684
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:38,796
( all laugh )

685
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:40,756
Well, the last time
I checked.

686
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:41,757
Is something wrong?

687
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,467
Actually...

688
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:44,677
there<i> is</i> something wrong.

689
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,137

692
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,904
Who the hell are they?

693
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,532
KES:
They're called
the Krenim.

694
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:07,574
How do you know that?

695
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,575
Captain Janeway?

696
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,576
What is it, Kes?

697
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,077
What do you know
about them?

698
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,955
Shields down to 39 percent,
Captain.

699
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,415
I don't understand
how these torpedoes

700
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,583
are ripping right through
our shields.

701
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,293
Evasive maneuvers,
Mr. Paris.

702
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,212
B'Elanna, can we reroute power
to the forward shields?

703
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,588
TORRES:
I'm already trying.

704
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,215
Captain, these torpedoes
are chroniton-based.

705
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:24,758
They're passing through
our shields

706
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:27,386
because they're in a state
of temporal flux.

707
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:33,308
( yelling )

708
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,439
( alarm blaring;
agitated voices )

709
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,571
They're dead.

B'Elanna!

712
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:03,630
Hull breach on Deck 7.
We're losing life-support.

713
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,175
Evacuate the deck.
Tom, I need you at the conn.

714
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,554
Aye, sir.

715
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:13,265
Commander, they're arming

716
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,141
their torpedo
launchers again.

717
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,976
We cannot sustain
another direct hit.

718
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:19,563
Kes, you seem to know
something about these weapons.

719
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:21,231
Do you have any idea
how we can stop them?

720
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,358
I'm not sure, but I think
it has something to do

721
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,984
with remodulating
the targeting scanners.

722
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,695
KIM:
That could work.

723
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,614
If we remodulate the scanners
to a parametric frequency,

724
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:30,699
we might be able to destroy
the torpedo launchers

725
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,033
before they fire.

726
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,702
Mr. Tuvok, you heard the man.

727
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,788
Tom, bring us about.

728
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,331
Ready, Commander.

729
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,166
Fire!

730
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,050
CHAKOTAY:
Do you have a casualty report?

731
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,638
KIM: Including Captain Janeway
and B'Elanna, we lost 11 people.

732
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,473
What about the ship?

733
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,934
Starboard shield generators
and warp drive are off-line,

734
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:59,895
and power is down
on Decks 4 through 12.

735
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,521
Make Deck 5 your priority.

736
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,189
We've got to get
Sick Bay up and running again.

737
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,650
Aye, sir.

738
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,025
Kes, as far as what you say
is happening to you...

739
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,319
I understand
that my condition

740
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,695
can't be a priority now.

741
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,489
Tom, I'm going to
need you to stay here

742
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:12,031
and help treat
these people.

743
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,533
When this is over,

744
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,535
we're all going to have
a lot of grieving to do.

745
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:18,956
How are you doing?

746
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,541
Tom?

747
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,711
I know it doesn't
seem possible now,

748
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,672
but you're going
to be all right.

749
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:28,882
I wish I could believe you.

750
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:31,134
You can.

751
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,306
Thanks.

752
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,852
Kes, we've got
radiation leakage

753
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:41,812
coming from one of the Krenim
torpedo fragments.

754
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:43,856
People are starting
to complain of nausea.

755
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:46,608
Chroniton radiation.

756
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,236
This is it.

757
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,238
I'm infected.

758
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,991
Where's the radiation
coming from?

759
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:57,243
It's lodged in a Jefferies
tube on Deck 11, Section 2.

760
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,829
I've got to get down there.

761
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:00,580
You can't, the entire
deck is sealed off.

762
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,333
I have to find the exact
temporal variance
of that torpedo.

763
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,669
You can't go near that thing.
You'll be burned to a crisp.

764
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,963
I know what I'm doing.
You stay here and help
Tom, all right?

765
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:09,422
Yes, but...

766
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:19,265
( alarm blaring )

767
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,409
( beeping )

768
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,388
( clears throat )

769
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,477
( coughing )

770
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,902
( coughing )

771
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,608
( coughing )

772
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,784
Kes, how are you coming

773
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,160
with those
analgesic compounds?

774
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,121
Doctor, you've lost
your hair.

775
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:05,956
I beg your pardon?

776
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:07,791
It's a long story.

777
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,793
The important thing is,

778
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:11,711
the temporal variance
of the chroniton torpedo

779
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:14,006
was 1.47 microseconds.

780
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:26,768
As far as I can determine,

781
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:29,021
I've now jumped a total
of six years into my past.

782
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:32,649
Do you have any theory
as to the cause of these jumps?

783
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,943
According to Kes,
she and the rest of the crew

784
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,987
will be infected
by chroniton radiation

785
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:38,655
approximately 11 months
from now.

786
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:39,906
Everyone will be inoculated

787
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,700
and the effects
will appear to vanish.

788
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,953
However, some five years later,
when I attempt an experimental--

789
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:46,496
and I might add,
ingenious procedure

790
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:48,790
to extend her life-span--
the bio-temporal field

791
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:52,251
I expose her to will trigger
dormant chroniton particles,

792
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,879
taking Kes out of temporal sync

793
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:56,589
and causing her to begin her
backward journey through time.

794
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,842
In all my years
in Starfleet,

795
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:02,428
I've never come across
a phenomenon quite like this.

796
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,889
Kes has been able to provide us

797
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:05,557
with the precise temporal
variance of the torpedo

798
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:06,975
which infected her.

799
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:08,810
Since Kes is moving
backward in time, she's

800
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,520
already been infected
by the radiation poisoning.

801
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,814
If we can set up
a bio-temporal chamber

802
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,525
and expose her
to a precisely modulated field

803
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:19,029
of antichroniton particles, we
feel this may purge her system

804
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:21,781
and bring her back in temporal
sync with the rest of us.

805
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,658
Well, we better get moving.

806
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,577
For all we know, Kes's
next jump will take her

807
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,704
back to a time when
we're not here to help her.

808
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:29,748
Captain, there's something else
I have to tell you.

809
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,499
In about six months,
you're going to enter

810
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,877
a region of space controlled
by a race called the Krenim.

811
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:36,171
You must avoid them
at all costs.

812
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:37,881
Tell me more.

813
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:40,425
TORRES:
I'm ready to bring
the chamber online.

814
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,969
Synaptic relays are operational.
How are her vital signs?

815
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,638
Pulse normal,
body temperature 14 degrees.

816
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:48,474
Chroniton level
at 79 roentgens.

817
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,645
Go ahead and activate
the chamber, Lieutenant.

818
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,817
Increase the bio-temporal
field stress.

819
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,987
Bringing field stress
to 25 kilodynes.

820
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:04,657
All right, let's try
the antichronitons.

821
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,993
Whenever
you're ready, Doc.

822
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:12,165
Initiating antichroniton burst.

823
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,961
Ten MEVs, five second pulse.

824
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,633
Pulse steady.

825
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,803
Body temperature at 14.2 degrees
and rising.

826
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,221
JANEWAY:
What about her
chroniton count?

827
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:28,681
Chroniton count...
is 71 roentgens

828
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,225
and dropping.

829
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:31,684
It's working.

830
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,603
DOCTOR:
Lieutenant Torres,
increase the field

831
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,188
strength to 30 kilodynes.

832
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:36,273
Right.

833
00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:37,732
Initiating
another burst.

834
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,943
15 MEVs, five
second pulse.

835
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,948
Body temperature, 14.9 degrees.

836
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:47,533
Chroniton count, 68 roentgens...

837
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,037
Sixty...

838
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,372
Fifty-seven...

839
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,084
Fifty-two...

840
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,880
NEELIX:
You need a cook.

841
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,926
You haven't lived until
you've tasted my<i> angla'bosque.</i>

842
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:07,595
It will be my job
to anticipate your needs

843
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,264
before you know
you have them.

844
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:11,099
Not again.

845
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,853
And I anticipate
your first need will be me.

846
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,896
I'm sorry.

847
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:19,607
I know this is going to
sound strange to you both,

848
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,067
but I don't belong here.

849
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,153
But we discussed this.

850
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:25,571
You don't understand.

851
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,824
I'm traveling backwards
in time, getting younger.

852
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:30,660
We have to lower
my chroniton levels.

853
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,037
You've got to get me

854
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:33,705
into the bio-temporal
chamber right away.

855
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,207
I-I'm sorry, Captain.

856
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:36,708
I-I didn't quite

857
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:37,792
anticipate this.

858
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,460
Listen to me, please.

859
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,962
Sweeting, try to calm down.

860
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,255
I assure you, Captain,

861
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:43,756
she's never behaved
this way before.

862
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,758
Hold on a minute,
Mr. Neelix.

863
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,886
Kes, why don't you
start over slowly?

864
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,889
It begins about eight years
in the future

865
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,932
when I'm about to die...

866
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,267
No!

867
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:02,942
MALE:
Time for dinner.

868
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:07,655
What's wrong, Kes?

869
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,165
Who are you?

870
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,251
What is this place?

871
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:20,585
We don't have
time to play

872
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,379
our guessing game
right now, Kes.

873
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:24,047
You know how your mother gets
when we're late to the table.

874
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:26,549
You're my father.

875
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:29,344
That's right, and you're
my favorite daughter,

876
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:30,469
but don't tell anyone.

877
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,971
Listen to me.

878
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,639
Something terrible's
been happening to me.

879
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,474
What's wrong?

880
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,602
There might not be much time,
so I've got to explain quickly.

881
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:39,396
Please try to believe me.

882
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:41,398
I've been living aboard
a starship called<i> Voyager.</i>

883
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:44,401
A starship... I see.

884
00:40:44,401 --> 00:40:46,903
So now it's not only the surface
you're dreaming about exploring.

885
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:47,862
Listen to me.

886
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,447
I<i> did</i> go to the surface,

887
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,907
or, rather, I<i> will</i> go there,

888
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:52,325
and the people aboard the ship,

889
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:53,701
they're going to rescue me
from the Kazon

890
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,036
and take me
with them.

891
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,288
Why don't you
finish telling me

892
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:57,580
about your adventures
after dinner?

893
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,664
No! There's no time.

894
00:40:58,664 --> 00:40:59,916
You've got to believe me.

895
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:01,126
One moment, I was
this old woman,

896
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:02,335
and then,
and then...

897
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:03,878
Kes, we're late.

898
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,504
Father, please.

899
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:07,673
( groaning )

900
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,467
( yelling in pain )

901
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,262
I can see the toes!
It's coming, Martis.

902
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:13,638
( yelling in pain )

903
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:21,980
It's a girl.

904
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:22,981
( baby wailing )

905
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,607
Oh!

906
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,610
Oh, Kes!

907
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,861
Oh!

908
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:31,030
Oh...

909
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:37,870
( heartbeat thudding )

910
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:56,514
( heartbeat thudding )

911
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,525
It's a girl.

912
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,609
( baby wailing )

913
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:09,735
Oh!

914
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,404
Oh, she's so...

915
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:13,365
She's so beautiful.

916
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:14,657
Kes!

917
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:18,203
Oh...

918
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:23,541
I think one day,
she'll see the sun.

919
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,087
( gurgling )

920
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:32,675
( tricorder beeping )

921
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,469
51 roentgens.

922
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:36,804
Forty-six...

923
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,015
Thirty-four.

924
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:41,309
Another antichroniton burst--
20 MEVs.

925
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:43,144
Right.

926
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:45,522
Levels are continuing to drop.

927
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:46,772
Pulse normal.

928
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:50,276
Body temperature steady
at 16.3 degrees.

929
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:51,610
( tricorder beeping )

930
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:55,198
Chroniton levels
are at zero roentgens.

931
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:58,117
Welcome back, Kes.

932
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:01,120
What's the date?
How old am I?

933
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,497
The same age you were

934
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:04,165
when we put you into
the bio-temporal chamber--

935
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:07,168
a healthy three years
and two months.

936
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:09,921
And due to an extraordinary
display of medical heroics,

937
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:12,382
you're back in temporal sync
with the rest of us.

938
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:23,560
So, I'm going to become
a security officer.

939
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,936
How about that?

940
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:26,396
Fortunately,
Mr. Neelix,

941
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:27,939
what Kes has
been describing

942
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,815
is merely
one possible future.

943
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,568
On each occasion
that she jumped

944
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:34,487
to a previous time,
her subsequent actions

945
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:37,073
most likely altered the future
from that moment on.

946
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:39,033
Good point, Tuvok.

947
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,869
Maybe I'll turn out to be
Chief Security Officer.

948
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,496
KIM:
So, Kes...

949
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:46,458
have you regained<i> all</i> 
your memories of the past?

950
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:49,586
I remember last month's
supply of replicator rations

951
00:43:49,586 --> 00:43:52,422
that you borrowed
that you owe me...

952
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:54,132
if that's
what you're asking.

953
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,217
Don't worry.
I haven't forgotten.

954
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:57,802
I realize
it's only hypothetical,

955
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:59,554
but still,
I'd be curious to know

956
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:01,264
what sorts
of medical breakthroughs

957
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:03,391
I'm going to make
in this possible future.

958
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,059
It's not as if
I've seen everything

959
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,186
that's going to happen
over the next six years.

960
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:08,563
I only remember
short periods

961
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:10,231
I experienced
between jumps.

962
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:11,566
Even so,
I bet you found out

963
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,568
some pretty
interesting things.

964
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:15,528
Yeah, Kes.
Tell us what you know.

965
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:16,904
CHAKOTAY:
Careful, Tom.

966
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,281
You may find out
that you leave<i> Voyager</i>

967
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:20,241
only to join a monastery.
( laughter )

968
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:22,076
Hey, give him
a little credit.

969
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,536
I'll bet he gets married
and has a family.

970
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:25,663
Thank you.
Don't mention it.

971
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:26,705
Are you telling?

972
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,874
Well,
as Tuvok said,

973
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:31,043
I've only seen pieces
of one possible future.

974
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,545
PARIS:
You know what?

975
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:33,921
Don't tell me.
I don't want to know.

976
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,590
I like a little
mystery in my life.

977
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:37,258
JANEWAY:
Tom's right.

978
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:40,303
I think we should all leave
the future to the future.

979
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:42,514
While I agree it would
not be wise for Kes

980
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:44,432
to make all of
her experiences public,

981
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:45,724
a report on
anything she knows

982
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,560
about these Krenim
might be useful.

983
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,604
I'll get started right away.

984
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,272
JANEWAY:
Hang on a minute.

985
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:53,316
I didn't mean<i> now.</i> 
Stay and enjoy your party.

986
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:55,276
If there's one thing this
experience has taught me,

987
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:57,903
it's that there's
no time like the present.

988
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,822
( all scoff )

989
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:03,868
<i>( light</i>
<i>dramatic music playing )</i>

990
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:13,127
<i>( dramatic</i>
<i>theme music playing )</i>
