1
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:21,772
[indistinct conversation]

2
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:54,054
[indistinct conversation]

3
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:04,898
Excuse me, can you tell me
where I can find the supervisor?

4
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:06,858
-Over there.
-Thank you.

5
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,496
Your authorization
and licenses, please?

6
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:25,377
Level 6 in Thermodynamics
<i>and</i> Quantum Fusion.

7
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,673
-Well, Janeway, I'm impressed.
-Thank you, sir.

8
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,384
Now, if you could just manage
to report to your shift on time.

9
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,428
I'm sorry. I boarded
the wrong transport.

10
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,431
I ended up at the Atmosphere
Filtration Facility.

11
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,266
They're always looking
for skilled workers.

12
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,143
I'm surprised
they didn't offer you a job.

13
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,603
I promise I won't be late again.

14
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:45,022
Well, it's easy to get disoriented
when you're new here.

15
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:48,609
I've been in this city all my life,
and I still get lost on occasion.

16
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:51,653
Now, you'll be monitoring
the primary reactor coils.

17
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,322
They process more
than 8,000 metric...

18
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,449
8,000 metric tons
of tylium per second

19
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,868
at 94 percent thermal efficiency.

20
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,246
I memorized the specifications.

21
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,498
Let me know
if there's anything you need.

22
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:06,209
You'll find we like
to keep our workforce happy.

23
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:10,047
I can already tell it's going to be
much better than my last job.

24
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,218
The specifications you asked for.

25
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,386
Thanks.

26
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,404
[alarm sounds]

27
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,574
[Computer]
Input Error 415.

28
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:47,704
Command Code Violation 2308.

29
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,498
[alarm continues]

30
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,583
Come on,
shut off that damn alarm,

31
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,127
and I promise I'll never
violate you again.

32
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,171
[alarm stops]

33
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,507
You almost started
a core overload.

34
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,841
I would have corrected it.

35
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:03,762
Well, I'm sorry for interrupting, then.
And for eavesdropping.

36
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,431
I overheard you talking
to your console.

37
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:09,142
-It's an old habit.
-Does it work?

38
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:13,146
I'm not sure this control panel and I
speak the same language yet.

39
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,066
Well, if you need an interpreter...
Jaffen.

40
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,151
Kathryn.

41
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,486
I work just down there.

42
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,904
That's good to know.

43
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,532
[Seven] This station doesn't
require two operators.

44
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,661
-I don't think we've met. I'm...
-Employee 1326.

45
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,372
And you're Employee 8584.

46
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,623
Since you're new here,

47
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,750
you may not be fully familiar
with the labor protocols,

48
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,001
but you should be aware

49
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,670
that fraternizing is not
permitted during work hours.

50
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,964
And do you have a number
or maybe a name?

51
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,715
Annika Hansen.

52
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,884
And what exactly is
your position here?

53
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,553
I'm the new Efficiency Monitor.

54
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,514
Oh, I, uh, didn't know
they'd hired one.

55
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,308
Now that you do, I suggest
you return to your station.

56
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,726
[Janeway]
We weren't fraternizing.

57
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,020
He was just helping me
correct an input error.

58
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,856
We're almost finished.

59
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,191
-Do it quickly.
-Yes, ma'am.

60
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,987
I thought we were fraternizing.

61
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,655
[laughs quietly]

62
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,993
Maybe we could get
acquainted after work.

63
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,704
Uh, there is a little place
some of us like to go to.

64
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,914
-We could get a meal.
-I can't.

65
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,584
You need to talk to someone
besides your console.

66
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:19,546
I appreciate the offer,
but with this new job,

67
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,715
I don't really have time
to socialize.

68
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,883
[sighs]

69
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:37,439
They're always looking for laborers
at the Power Distribution Plant.

70
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:41,109
I had a job there once.
Didn't like it much.

71
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:45,739
Odd.
They treat their employees well.

72
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,449
How long were you there?

73
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,825
Oh, a while.

74
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,120
It would be very simple
for me to find out.

75
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,246
A day.

76
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,582
A day?

77
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,960
Half a day, actually,
give or take an hour.

78
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,963
Not what I'd call an illustrious career.

79
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:06,301
I don't belong behind a console
pushing buttons.

80
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:11,056
But when I heard some of the workers
talking about your place,

81
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,516
I knew I had to get a job here.

82
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,102
You were terminated, weren't you?

83
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,228
Yes.

84
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:21,358
Oh, that's quite an accomplishment
during a labor shortage.

85
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,817
What happened?

86
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,986
Oh, it's a long story.

87
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,781
I like a long story.

88
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,409
I had a disagreement with
the new Efficiency Monitor.

89
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,495
She didn't think
my work was very...

90
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,372
-Efficient?
-Exactly.

91
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,290
Then why should I hire you?

92
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:42,003
Well, there's my natural charm
and personality.

93
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,005
They'd be a real asset
around a place like this,

94
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,007
where you're trying
to attract patrons.

95
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,009
I mean, look at you.

96
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,011
You haven't been able
to tear yourself away from me.

97
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,472
There's no one else here.

98
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,185
[sighs]

99
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,813
Please.

100
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,232
I really need the work.

101
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,070
You'd better clean those tables
over there.

102
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,280
This place is going to be
filled with hungry workers

103
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,949
as soon as the next shift ends.

104
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,867
You won't regret this.

105
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,996
Oh, I'm certain I will.

106
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:27,424
[indistinct conversation, laughter]

107
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,009
[Jaffen]
...all of them about my father,

108
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,511
and he couldn't understand
why I wasn't insulted.

109
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,097
Finally, I just had to tell him:
I'm Norvalian.

110
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,640
I don't have a father.

111
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:38,101
[laughter]

112
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,812
[hearty laughter]

113
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,731
It wasn't that funny, Tuvok.

114
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,400
[chortling]
On the contrary.

115
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,820
The man was ignorant of how
your species procreates.

116
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:49,946
[laughs]

117
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:54,242
His attempt to disparage you
ultimately humiliated him.

118
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,744
[laughs]

119
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,620
Irony is often a source of humor.

120
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,623
Yes, well, when you explain it
like that, uh...

121
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,083
it's not funny at all.

122
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,836
I also have some
humorous anecdotes to share.

123
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,629
I'll look forward to hearing them.

124
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,425
I thought you didn't
have time to socialize.

125
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,926
I'm not socializing.

126
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,471
I'm reviewing these manuals
and having something to eat.

127
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,181
Well, I recommend
the Latara broth

128
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,016
and the section
on thermal coefficients.

129
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,602
-I'll join you.
-Really, I'm very, very busy.

130
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:24,981
Well, not to socialize. To, uh,
help you review the manuals.

131
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,317
[laughs gently]

132
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,651
[man]
How was your first day?

133
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,570
[sighs heavily]
Here you are.

134
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,947
Compliments of the proprietress.

135
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,574
[Umali]
Tom.

136
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,951
Uh, I'll be right back.

137
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,331
The proprietress
doesn't give away drinks.

138
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,792
Well, I'm just creating
customer loyalty.

139
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:47,045
You've been creating loyalty all night
with those two women.

140
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,422
I suggest you attend
to the other tables.

141
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,548
Yes, ma'am.

142
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,096
-Here you are.
-Thank you. Looks great.

143
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,489
I can't believe
I let you keep me out this late.

144
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,199
Well, I thought it was
my responsibility

145
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,951
to help you study those manuals.

146
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,328
-[laughing] Of course.
-And now that I have,

147
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,163
you should be less likely
to overload the core.

148
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,289
[chuckles]

149
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,962
You know, with all this
fascinating discussion

150
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,255
about thermal coefficients,

151
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,132
you never told me where you're from.

152
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,008
A planet called Earth.

153
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,635
Never heard of it.

154
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,471
-Oh, a<i> long</i> way from here.
-What's it like?

155
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:42,725
Overpopulated, polluted,
very little work.

156
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,811
It sounds like my homeworld.

157
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,729
Guess we're both
lucky to be here.

158
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,607
It's nice to be in a place where
different species get along so well.

159
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,109
Oh, so, you admit we're getting along.

160
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,445
I was speaking
in a broader cultural context.

161
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:55,989
I see.

162
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,992
There's a lot of violence
where I come from.

163
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,952
That's too bad.

164
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,078
[man]
It's getting late.

165
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,872
I still haven't adjusted
to the weather here.

166
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,373
It gets so cold at night.

167
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,083
It's almost curfew.

168
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,544
Yes, sir. We both live right here.

169
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,631
Good night, then.

170
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:19,137
You know, one of the advantages
of living in employee housing

171
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,974
is that we can continue sharing ideas
even after the workday is over.

172
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,225
-Is that so?
-Yes,

173
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:27,437
and I do have a spectacular view
of the river from my living quarters.

174
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,232
I<i> really</i> have to get to sleep.
Maybe another time.

you uncomfortable.

You're not.

177
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,739
Well, if you get lonely...

178
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,407
I'll let you know.

[alarm sounds]

181
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,926
It wasn't me.

182
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,260
[chuckles]

183
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:02,347
It's not an overload.
It's time for our inoculations.

184
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,350
-What inoculations?
-They're nothing to worry about.

185
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,726
Protection against ambient radiation.

186
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,771
I didn't realize that was a problem.

187
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,273
It's not, as long as you're
inoculated regularly.

188
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,694
We're lucky to have an employer
that concerned about our safety.

189
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,030
[man]
It wasn't that bad.

190
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,198

It doesn't bother me.

191
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,866

How long did it take to go away?

192
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,120
[man]
Ten days, two weeks.

193
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,295
Is something wrong?

194
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:38,299
Forgive me, but I'm--
I'm afraid of injections.

195
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,510
I assure you, this is painless.

196
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:45,473
Is-- Is there some other method
of administering the medication?

197
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,809
No, I'm afraid there isn't.

198
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:48,977
Very well.

199
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,693
No! No! No!

200
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,862
We're finished.

201
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,614
You can go back to work.

202
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,867
Next.

<i>with the Nar Shaddan.</i>

206
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:36,107
In six years, I've never been
on an away mission

207
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,692
worse than this one.

208
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,569
I don't know how you can say that.

209
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,821
The cargo hold is crammed
with valuable supplies.

210
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:48,411
And my stomach is crammed
with alien parasites doing backflips.

211
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,205
I guess you shouldn't have drunk
that Falah nectar.

212
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,082
You insisted I try it.

213
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,794
Uh! The Nar Shaddan
consider it a delicacy.

214
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,629
To refuse would've insulted them.

215
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:02,508
I didn't hear you insisting
that Commander Chakotay try it.

216
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:05,053
Commander Chakotay's
a vegetarian.

217
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,805
It was made from meat?

218
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,599
More like a meat byproduct.

219
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,226
[sighs]
I'm going to be sick.

220
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,228
Not after you drink this.

Ugh! It smells worse

224
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:26,908
I'll wait for the Doctor to treat me.

225
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,826
At least I'll be sleeping
in my own bed tonight.

On our way.

229
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,879
[Neelix]
Anything wrong, Commander?

230
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,924
We're at the rendezvous coordinates,
but there's no sign of<i> Voyager,</i>

231
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,675
and they're not responding to hails.

Start scanning on all frequencies.

233
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,930
They've got to be out there
somewhere.

234
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,433
So much for my own bed.

<i>Negative.</i>

252
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,651

It's good to see

For that matter,
it's good to see any faces at all.

I'm sorry I haven't gotten
life support back online yet,

264
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:33,409

I can see that. Can you be
a little more specific?

268
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:40,958
Of course.

269
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:47,173
About 12 hours after
you left on your away mission,

270
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,008
things started to go wrong.

271
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,386
We hit some sort of subspace mine.

272
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:58,142
Computer, transfer the EMH
to the mobile emitter.

It wasn't long before
I was inundated with casualties,

tetryon radiation poisoning.

Doctor, can you treat these people?

279
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:17,411
I can stabilize them, but if we can't
contain the radiation...

280
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:20,039
Get everyone to the escape pods,
quickly.

281
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,832

and head for the nearest
habitable planet.

291
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,397

00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:05,431
What is that medication?

348
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,893
An antiradiation serum,
perfectly safe.

349
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,611
[Tuvok]
What are you doing?

350
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,946
She's suffering from
Dysphoria Syndrome.

351
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,156
Don't worry, it's treatable.

352
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,867
[electronic whirring]

353
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,789
[groans]
Release her immediately.

354
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,540
Restrain him.

355
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,709
[groans]
Captain!

357
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,880
No! No!

358
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,261
[low, indistinct chatter]

359
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:51,143
-Excuse me.
-Hi.

360
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,103
I believe we know each other.

361
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:56,065
You're Tuvok, right? We met
last week at the shift briefing.

362
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,360
Before that.
Before we were working here.

363
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,861
Oh, I don't think so.

364
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:03,656
I mean, we're obviously not
from the same place. [laughs]

365
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:07,117
Still, I believe I know you.

366
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:09,161
From the hospital, perhaps?

367
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,330
What hospital?

368
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:14,834
I am not certain.
We-- We were patients.

369
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,752
You must have me confused
with someone else.

370
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,921
I've never been sick enough
to go to a hospital.

371
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,923
I'm sorry,
I have a lot of work to finish.

372
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:26,095
Please. Try to remember.
It-- It may be important.

373
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,598
-Is there a problem here?
-I think it's just a misunderstanding.

374
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:30,933
Tuvok?

375
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,854
She's right.

376
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,565
It's, uh...it's a--
it's a misunderstanding.

377
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:40,484
You don't look well. Maybe
you should go to the infirmary.

378
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:42,820
No, no, I'm fine. Fine.

379
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,865
Uh, I'll go back to my station.

380
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,992
Sorry to have bothered you.

381
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,496
-What was that all about?
-I'm not sure.

382
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,290
Strange man.

383
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:56,250
And a terrible joke teller.

384
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,712
So are we having dinner tonight?

385
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,797
-Again?
-What, you don't like my cooking?

386
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:05,634
-No, it's wonderful. It's just...
-I'm a perfectionist.

387
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,679
I'm going to keep trying
until I make you the perfect meal.

388
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,931
And then we stop eating together?

389
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:14,143
I'll have dinner with you.
On one condition:

390
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,897
I make it.

391
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:22,818
-I think I can accept those terms.
-Good.

392
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,236
Now go back to your station

393
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,031
before the Efficiency Monitor
catches us fraternizing.

394
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:36,874
[clears throat]

395
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,459
Can I bring you something else?

396
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,502
No, thank you.

397
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,755
I haven't seen you in here before.

398
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,174
You probably just didn't notice.

399
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,384
Oh, I'd have noticed.

400
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:51,764
Well, apparently,
you aren't as observant

401
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,849
-as you think you are.
-Oh, really?

402
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,935
I've been coming in here
the same time every day

403
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:59,355
-for the past two weeks.
-Well, that explains it.

404
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,065
I usually work nights.

405
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,358
Me, too.

406
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,152
At the Power Distribution Facility.

407
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,904
You see? I am observant.

408
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,614
Tom.

409
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,992
Hmm. I need you for a moment.

410
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:13,327
I'll be right there.

411
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:20,000
Listen, you should come back in
when you get a night off.

412
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:22,169
It's a lot more fun
when there's a crowd.

413
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,296
I don't really like crowds.

414
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,798
Well, then,
maybe we could get together

415
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,550
during the day sometime,
take a walk by the river.

416
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,135
-I don't think so.
-Why not?

417
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:33,931
I am a very engaging
conversationalist.

418
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,685
-Oh.
-Yeah.

419
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,854
Still want to get together?

420
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:42,982
You're married.

421
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,775
No.

422
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:47,236
Oh.

423
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,029
Enjoy your day.

I've scanned ships and planets

No humans, no Vulcans,
no Bolians.

441
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:50,883
Maybe we can increase
the range of the sensors

I appreciate your input, Doc,

446
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:01,060
but I didn't call you down here
to help me scan.

447
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:04,313
I'm still feeling kind of queasy
from that nectar.

448
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,689
I treated you days ago.

449
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,900
Whatever you did hasn't worked.

450
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,985
Maybe all those command
subroutines

451
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:13,447
are compromising
your medical abilities.

452
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:17,493
Maybe all that sarcasm is
compromising your natural charm.

453
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,086
I have repaired
the deuterium injectors,

454

00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,385
Good work.
Why don't you get started

457
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,846

It's only burnt on the outside.

00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,873
No. But I want these people
to think we are.

519
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:13,270
Hope the cooking console's
not being temperamental again.

520
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:17,107
Making a hot drink
is one thing I can do.

521
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,362
-You're right. It's good.
-I told you.

522
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,329
Mmm.

523
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:33,582
What's even better
is being here with you.

524
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,252
Are you comfortable?

525
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,588
The blanket's nice and warm.

526
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,007
No, I mean here with me.

527
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:50,307
I can't remember
being more comfortable...

528
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,769
in my life.

529
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:58,273
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

530
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,067
[clears throat]

531
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,193
Hi.

532
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,613
[sighs]

533
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,865
Listen, I get off work
in a few minutes.

534
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,492
I thought maybe you
and I could go to...

535
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,202
You don't give up, do you?

536
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,496
You don't even know
what I was gonna say.

537
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:13,997
Let me guess.

538
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:17,000
You're going to invite me
to take a walk by the river

539
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:20,504
or maybe to your living quarters
to admire the view.

540
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,672
Actually...

541
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:26,218
I was going to offer to introduce you
to some people I met.

542
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:30,138
A couple expecting their first baby
in a few weeks.

543
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:33,767
I thought you might want
to get to know some other parents.

544
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,103
You know, swap stories,

545
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:38,730
maybe even find a playmate
for your baby.

546
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,858
If it's a bad idea...

547
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:44,111
No.

548
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:45,862
No, it's nice.

549
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:49,282
Listen, I'm sorry about the other day.

550
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:51,243
I'm the one
who should be apologizing.

551
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,953
-I shouldn't have assumed...
-Forget it.

552
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:55,622
Look, it's rare that I admit I'm wrong,

553
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,667
so you might as well take advantage
of it while you can.

554
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,131
It's been hard...

555
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,299
being alone with a baby coming.

556
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,468
I have a habit
of keeping my guard up.

557
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:10,470
Well, that's understandable.

558
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:13,598
It's just...a romantic relationship

559
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,475
is really out of the question
for me right now,

560
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,018
-and when you started asking...
-How about a friend?

561
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,478
What?

562
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:22,399
Well, you said romance
is out of the question.

563
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,067
Could you use a friend?

564
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,034
[door opens]

565
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,536
Any progress?

566
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,997
I've spoken to the captains
of eight vessels

567
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,291
that left Quarra
in the last two weeks.

568
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,293
No one knew anything
about the crew?

569
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,880
No. But every one of them asked me
if I was looking for employment.

570
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,090
Apparently, there's
a severe labor shortage

571
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:48,383
throughout this system.

572
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,343
There's a lot of competition
for workers.

573
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:52,262
That ambassador said
most of our people

574
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,431
were working
at the main power facility.

575
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:57,225
I wonder if they still have
any positions to fill.

576
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:00,103
I can make some inquiries.
Why?

577
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,899
Because you and I are going
to find ourselves jobs.

578
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,902
Reentering orbit
might arouse their suspicion.

579
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,653
Not if we take my ship.

580
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,655
-Good idea, Neelix.
-Commander,

581
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,908
you've spoken directly
with several government officials.

582
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,618
You could be recognized.

583
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:15,911
[sighs]

584
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,206
Isn't reconstructive surgery
one of your specialties?

585
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:31,635
I still say you should've posed
as a Talaxian.

586
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,386
We'd have made a striking pair.

587
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,472
Whiskers make me itch.

588
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,390
How did it go?

589
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:39,726
As soon as I told the supervisor
our qualifications,

590
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,269
he was eager to hire us.

591
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,980
He even helped me get
a docking permit for my ship.

592
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:46,441
We'll be gainfully employed
by tomorrow morning.

593
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:49,152
-Here you go, Doc.
-Give me your hand, Mr. Neelix.

594
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:50,362
What's this?

595
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,821
[Kim]
A subdermal transponder.

596
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,949
It will allow us
to maintain an open com-link

597
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,618
so we can transport you through
the shield grid if there's trouble.

598
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,204
Hold position
at maximum transporter range.

599
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,497
Aye, sir.

600
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,291
I assumed I'd be in charge
during your absence, Commander.

601
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,668
Excuse me?

602
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,461
An Emergency Command Hologram,

603
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:09,422
programmed with over two million
tactical subroutines,

604
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:11,633
outranks an Ensign.

605
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,176
A few words to the computer,

606
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,137
and this Ensign
can delete those subroutines.

607
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,974
Then you'd be depriving yourself
of a skilled leader

608
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,350
for the sake of your ego.

609
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,477
-Oh,<i> my</i> ego!
-Gentlemen.

610
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,814
Work it out.

611
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,691
[both]
Aye, sir.

612
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:48,211
[low, indistinct chatter]

613
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,091
Employee 8583.

614
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,345
Mr. Tuvok.

615
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,639
According to my records,
you've neglected to report

616
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:02,267
for your last three inoculations.

617
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,521
These inoculations
are for your protection.

618
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,651
A sick worker is not
an efficient worker.

619
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:13,987
Report to the infirmary.

620
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,989
Seven of Nine.

621
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,824
What?

622
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:22,162
Seven of Nine.
It's...your designation.

623
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,914
My employee number is 8586.

624
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:27,792
Take your hands off me!
Call Security!

625
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,801
I don't believe you are
who you think you are!

626
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,554
[Tuvok]
We don't belong here.

627
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,306
We don't belong here!

628
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,017
This isn't right!

629
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,769
We don't belong here!

630
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:58,448
Qualification Level 3
in microkinetics.

631
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,742
You could use some
improvement there.

632
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,453
Level 5 in thermionic conversion.

633
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,788
Good.

634
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,915
We lost a thermionic
specialist yesterday.

635
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,416
Did he find a better job?

636
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,126
Uh, health problems.

637
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,711
Someone you know?

638
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:14,964
No, just...an unusual species.

639
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:16,841
We have a diverse workforce.

640
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:19,928
Our thermionic converters
operate on a rotating frequency,

641
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,805
so they have to be
closely monitored.

642
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,391
You'll be required to report
your readings to the Controller

643
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:26,601
at regular intervals.

644
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,061
Any questions?

645
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,734
Are you listening to me?

646
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:38,947
Sorry, sir.
I'm just excited to be here.

647
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:42,075
Carry on.

648
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,592
-Kathryn.
-Yes?

649
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:01,761
It's Chakotay.

650
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,263
I'm sorry?

651
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,433
I'm new here.

652
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:08,768
The supervisor said
you would be a good person

653
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,603
to speak to if I had any questions.

654
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:13,314
Mm. What can I help you with?

655
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:17,402
Nothing. I just wanted
to introduce myself.

656
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,321
Oh. What did you say
your name was?

657
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:21,906
Chakotay.

658
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:25,034
Actually, that's just
what my friends call me.

659
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:27,871
My employment file
lists my given name:

660
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,248
Amal Kotay.

661
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,624
Well, whatever your name is,

662
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,626
I'm happy to help you
any way I can.

663
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:36,129
[Tuvok groans, shudders]

664
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,299
No. No!

665
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:42,260
You're experiencing
a relapse of Dysphoria Syndrome.

666
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,845
This is going to make you
feel better.

667
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,848
Get away from me! No, no, please.

668
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:49,267
Losing my job there

669
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,978
was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

670
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,229
Why is that?

671
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:55,648
Well, so many rules
and regulations.

672
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:57,734
It was like a military operation.

673
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:58,985
I know what you mean.

674
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,362
"Report here, reroute power there."

675
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,865
It's almost like serving
aboard a starship.

676
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,911
Have you ever done that?

677
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:11,706
You're looking at the former captain
of his own cargo vessel.

678
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,417
Hmm, must be quite a life.

679
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:17,504
What about you?
Ever worked on a ship?

680
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:20,632
Oh, no.
Space travel makes me sick.

681
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,675
[Torres laughing]

682
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,803
I'm not lying.

683
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:28,014
[Neelix] So, do you know most
of the people that come in here?

684
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,724
A lot of them.

685
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,435
This is a great place to work.

686
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:33,728
Seems like it.

687
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:36,272
I could put in a good word
for you to my employer.

688
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:37,398
[Chakotay]
Ah, Neelix.

689
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,526
I was wondering
when you'd get here.

690
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:42,612
Amal Kotay,
this is my new friend Tom Paris.

691
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,281
-What can I get you?
-That looks good.

692
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:50,036
I was assigned
to the primary fusion chamber

693
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,205
along with Mulcahey and Celes.

694
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,165
Neither of them recognized me.

695
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:57,710
Let me guess.
They really love their jobs.

696
00:38:57,794 --> 00:39:01,464
It's like they've all been
programmed to be happy here.

697
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:04,133
It's a safe bet they're not
going to leave willingly.

698
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:05,635
Here you go.

699
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,011
[man]
Look, there's a table over there.

700
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,055
[indistinct chatter]

701
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,473
-[man] Hey.
-[woman] Hi.

702
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:11,975
[man] How are you?

703
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,686
-Hi. How was your first day?
-Not bad.

704
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:17,105
Would you and your friend
like to join us?

705
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,274
That would be nice.

706
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,443
Um, actually, I was hoping
we could eat alone tonight.

707
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:26,072
Maybe another time.

708
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,078
-That was rude.
-I'm sorry. I just, um...

709
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:34,664
There's something
I'd like to talk to you about.

710
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,168
Thanks.

711
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:40,628
-Bye-bye.
-Thank you for joining us.

712
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:42,964
[Paris]
B'Elanna.

713
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:46,926
I'm due for a break.
I'll walk you to the transport.

714
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,761
Stop worrying. I'll be fine.

715
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:51,097
It's not you that I'm worried about.

716
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,184
The baby will be fine, too.

717
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,866
So what I was thinking is...

718
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:15,788
if we were to combine our resources,

719
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,541
we would reduce our expenses.

720
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:23,504
Are you asking me to move in?

721
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:26,299
Yes.

722
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,178
I know it's impulsive.

723
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,972
I...know we haven't known
each other very long,

724
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:37,352
but things are so easy
when we're together.

725
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,772
-And I just thought I...
-Okay.

726
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,524
What?

727
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:47,236
Maybe I'm out of my mind...

728
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,531
but let's try it.

729
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,787
[man] I think this is gonna
be a lot of fun, don't you?

730
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:56,955
[woman]
It's gonna be great. You'll see.

731
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,414
-Yeah.
-Yeah, they're waiting for us.

732
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:00,625
Come on, we got to go, all right?

733
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,836
[low, indistinct chatter]

734
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:08,758
-[gasps]
-Oh, excuse me.

735
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:12,804
It was my fault.
I should watch where I'm going.

736
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,389
B'Elanna?

737
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,016
How do you know my name?

738
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,602
What if I told you
we were old friends?

739
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:23,398
That's a ridiculous statement.

740
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,859
I know it sounds strange,
but I can prove it to you.

741
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:29,362
Look, I'm sorry, but I'm late for work.

742
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,698
-Let go of me!
-I'm not going to hurt you.

743
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:33,574
[grunting]

744
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:35,493
[screams] Security, help!

745
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,787
Chakotay to<i> Voyager.</i>
We've got B'Elanna.

746
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,707
<i>Lock on to Neelix's signal,</i>
<i>and transport them to Sick Bay.</i>

747
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,334
-Acknowledged.
-Help me!

748
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:45,628
Let her go!

749
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,050
Stop!

750
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:53,428
Harry, I need
an emergency transport<i> now!</i>

751
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,723
Sorry, Commander,
we're under attack.

752
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:58,516
I had to raise shields.

753
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:05,565
[grunting]
No, leave me alone!

754
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,650
We're friends.
We're trying to help you.

755
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,360
No, don't touch me!

756
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:16,784
[electronic whirring]

757
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,630
[panting]

758
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:42,560
He turned into the accessway.

759
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,395
I'll call for reinforcements.

760
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,286
I think he went in there!

761
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:02,205
Be careful! He might be armed!
