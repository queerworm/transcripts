1
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,196
DAMAGE REPORT!

2
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,739
SHIELDS AT 60%.

3
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,869
OUR FUEL LINE HAS RUPTURED.
ATTEMPTING TO COMPENSATE.

4
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:37,454
DAMN IT! WE'RE BARELY
MAINTAINING IMPULSE.

5
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,414
I CAN'T GET ANY MORE OUT OF IT.

6
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,875
BE CREATIVE.

7
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,002
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO BE CREATIVE

8
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:45,379
WITH A 39-YEAR-OLD
REBUILT ENGINE?

9
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,046
Maquis ship,

10
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,925
this is Gul Evek
of the Cardassian Fourth Order.

11
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:51,301
Cut your engines

12
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:55,305
and prepare to surrender, or we
will de...

13
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:59,267
INITIATING
EVASIVE PATTERN OMEGA. MARK.

14
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,355
SHIELDS AT 50%.

15
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:05,065
I NEED MORE POWER TO MAKE IT

16
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,358
TO THE BADLANDS.

17
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:07,902
TAKE THE WEAPONS OFF-LINE.

18
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:09,987
WE'LL TRANSFER ALL POWER
TO THE ENGINES.

19
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,031
CONSIDERING THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
I'D QUESTION THAT AT THIS TIME.

20
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:13,741
WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

21
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,576
WE'RE NOT MAKING A DENT

22
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,244
IN THEIR
SHIELDS ANYWAY.

23
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,871
YOU WANTED CREATIVE.

24
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:21,248
TUVOK, SHUT DOWN
ALL THE PHASER BANKS.

25
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,667
ANOTHER 30 SECONDS
AT FULL IMPULSE,

26
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,586
I'LL GET US
INTO THE BADLANDS.

27
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,254
PHASERS OFF-LINE.

28
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,130
THROW THE LAST PHOTONS AT THEM

29
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,465
THEN GIVE ME THE POWER

30
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,175
FROM THE TORPEDO SYSTEMS.

31
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,636
ACKNOWLEDGED. FIRING PHOTONS.

32
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,978
ARE YOU READING ANY
PLASMA STORMS AHEAD?

33
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:46,314
ONE. COORDINATES 1-7-1 MARK 4-3.

34
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,191
THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING.

35
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:51,152
PLASMA STORM DENSITY
INCREASING BY 14%.

36
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,821
TWENTY...

37
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,322
TWENTY-FIVE...

38
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,657
HOLD ON!

39
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:06,209
CARDASSIAN SHIP NOT SLOWING.
THEY'RE FOLLOWING US IN.

40
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,670
GUL EVEK MUST FEEL DARING TODAY.

41
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,260
Tuvok:
THEY'VE BEEN HIT.

42
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,972
THEY'RE SENDING OUT
A DISTRESS SIGNAL

43
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,640
ON CARDASSIAN FREQUENCIES.

44
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,225
CAN YOU PLOT A COURSE
THROUGH THESE FIELDS?

45
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,853
STORM ACTIVITY IS WIDESPREAD
IN THIS VICINITY.

46
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,355
I CAN PLOT A COURSE,
BUT IT WILL REQUIRE

47
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,607
AN INDIRECT ROUTE.

48
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,525
WE CAN USE THE TIME
TO MAKE SOME REPAIRS.

49
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,988
WHAT WAS THAT?
CURIOUS...

50
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:35,614
WE PASSED THROUGH SOME KIND

51
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,324
OF COHERENT
TETRION BEAM.

52
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,285
SOURCE?
UNKNOWN.

53
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,913
A MASSIVE DISPLACEMENT WAVE
IS MOVING TOWARD US.

54
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,372
ANOTHER STORM?

55
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,125
NOT A PLASMA PHENOMENON.

56
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,334
AT CURRENT SPEEDS

57
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,544
IT WILL INTERCEPT US
IN 30 SECONDS.

58
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,756
ANYTHING LEFT IN THOSE
IMPULSE GENERATORS, B'ELANNA?

59
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:53,924
WE'LL FIND OUT.

60
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,676
STILL EXCEEDING
OUR SPEED.

61
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:56,927
MAXIMUM POWER.

62
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,470
WAVE IS
ACCELERATING.

63
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,930
IT WILL INTERCEPT US

64
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,348
IN EIGHT SECONDS.

65
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:04,309
FIVE.

66
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,487
Woman:
TOM PARIS?

67
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,992
KATHRYN JANEWAY.

68
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,494
I SERVED WITH YOUR FATHER
ON THE<i> AL-BATANI.</i>

69
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,872
I WONDER IF WE COULD
GO SOMEWHERE AND TALK?

70
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,791
ABOUT WHAT?

71
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,418
ABOUT A JOB WE'D LIKE YOU
TO DO FOR US.

72
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,629
I'M ALREADY DOING A JOB...

73
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,214
FOR THE FEDERATION.

74
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:42,467
THE REHAB COMMISSION
IS VERY PLEASED WITH YOUR WORK.

75
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:46,596
THEY'VE GIVEN ME THEIR APPROVAL
TO DISCUSS THIS MATTER WITH YOU.

76
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,641
WELL, THEN I GUESS I'M YOURS.

77
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,521
YOUR FATHER TAUGHT
ME A GREAT DEAL.

78
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:58,233
I WAS HIS SCIENCE OFFICER
DURING THE ARIAS EXPEDITION.

79
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,110
YOU MUST BE GOOD.

80
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,862
MY FATHER
ONLY ACCEPTS

81
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,031
THE BEST
AND THE BRIGHTEST.

82
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,532
I'M LEAVING
ON A MISSION

83
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,909
TO FIND A MAQUIS SHIP
THAT DISAPPEARED

84
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,744
IN THE BADLANDS
A WEEK AGO.

85
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,538
I WOULDN'T,
IF I WERE YOU.

86
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,831
REALLY?

87
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,125
I'VE NEVER SEEN
A FEDERATION STARSHIP

88
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,919
THAT COULD MANEUVER
THROUGH THE PLASMA STORMS.

89
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,880
YOU'VE NEVER
SEEN<i> VOYAGER.</i>

90
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,090
WE'D LIKE YOU
TO COME ALONG.

91
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:27,512
YOU'D LIKE ME TO LEAD YOU
TO MY FORMER COLLEAGUES.

92
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,973
I WAS ONLY WITH THE MAQUIS
A FEW WEEKS

93
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,975
BEFORE I WAS
CAPTURED, CAPTAIN.

94
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,978
I DON'T KNOW WHERE MOST
OF THEIR HIDING PLACES ARE.

95
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,479
YOU KNOW
THE TERRITORY

96
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,439
BETTER THAN ANYONE
WE'VE GOT.

97
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,691
WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT

98
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,860
ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR
MAQUIS SHIP?

99
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,738
MY CHIEF OF SECURITY WAS
ON BOARD-- UNDERCOVER.

100
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,781
HE WAS SUPPOSED
TO REPORT IN TWICE

101
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,533
DURING THE
LAST SIX DAYS.

102
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,910
HE DIDN'T.

103
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,411
MAYBE IT'S JUST
YOUR CHIEF OF SECURITY

104
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,663
WHO'S DISAPPEARED.

105
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,165
MAYBE.

106
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,375
THAT SHIP

107
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,625
WAS UNDER
THE COMMAND

108
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,877
OF ANOTHER
FORMER

109
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,128
STARFLEET
OFFICER

110
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,796
NAMED CHAKOTAY.

111
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,466
I UNDERSTAND YOU
KNEW HIM.

112
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,177
THAT'S RIGHT.

113
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:10,764
THE TWO OF YOU DIDN'T
GET ALONG TOO WELL, I'M TOLD.

114
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:14,351
CHAKOTAY WILL TELL YOU
HE LEFT STARFLEET ON PRINCIPLE--

115
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,478
TO DEFEND HIS HOME COLONY
FROM THE CARDASSIANS.

116
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:20,232
I, ON THE OTHER HAND,
WAS FORCED TO RESIGN.

117
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,192
HE CONSIDERED ME
A MERCENARY--

118
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,445
WILLING TO FIGHT FOR ANYONE
WHO'D PAY MY BAR BILLS.

119
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,696
THE TROUBLE IS

120
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,949
HE WAS RIGHT.

121
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,785
I HAVE NO PROBLEM HELPING YOU

122
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:36,373
TRACK DOWN MY "FRIENDS"
IN THE MAQUIS, CAPTAIN.

123
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,751
ALL I NEED TO KNOW FROM YOU
IS WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?

124
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,711
YOU HELP US FIND THAT SHIP

125
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,714
WE HELP YOU
AT YOUR NEXT OUTMATE REVIEW.

126
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,716
UH-HUH.

127
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,053
YOU'D BE A STARFLEET OBSERVER
DURING THE MISSION.

128
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,431
OBSERVER?

129
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:55,725
OH, HELL. I'M THE BEST PILOT
YOU COULD HAVE.

130
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,644
YOU'LL BE AN OBSERVER.

131
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:01,022
WHEN IT'S OVER,
YOU'RE CUT LOOSE.

132
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:04,484
STORY OF MY LIFE.

133
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,959
STADI, YOU'RE CHANGING
MY MIND ABOUT BETAZOIDS.

134
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,252
GOOD.

135
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,671
OH, THAT WASN'T
A COMPLIMENT.

136
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,174
UNTIL TODAY,
I ALWAYS CONSIDERED

137
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,509
YOUR PEOPLE
WARM AND SENSUAL.

138
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,346
I CAN BE WARM AND SENSUAL.

139
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,888
JUST NOT TO ME.

140
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:37,392
DO YOU ALWAYS FLY AT WOMEN
AT WARP SPEED, MR. PARIS?

141
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:40,103
ONLY WHEN THEY'RE
IN VISUAL RANGE.

142
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,358
THAT'S OUR SHIP.

143
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,985
THAT'S<i> VOYAGER.</i>

144
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,111
INTREPID CLASS--

145
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,155
SUSTAINABLE
CRUISE VELOCITY

146
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,032
OF WARP FACTOR 9.975.

147
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:56,577
15 DECKS, CREW
COMPLEMENT OF 141

148
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,621
BIO-NEURAL
CIRCUITRY.

149
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,998
BIO-NEURAL?

150
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,291
SOME OF THE
TRADITIONAL

151
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,002
CIRCUITRY HAS BEEN
REPLACED BY GEL PACKS

152
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,879
THAT CONTAIN
BIO-NEURAL CELLS.

153
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,756
THEY ORGANIZE INFORMATION
MORE EFFICIENTLY

154
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,467
SPEED UP RESPONSE TIME.

155
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:35,575
IF I MAY SAY SO,
IT'S BEEN MY SPECIAL PLEASURE

156
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,119
TO SEE MANY NEW OFFICERS
LIKE YOURSELF

157
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,913
COME THROUGH THESE PORTALS.

158
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,790
YOUR PARENTS MUST BE
VERY PROUD, MY BOY.

159
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,667
YOU KNOW, ON AN
OCCASION LIKE THIS...

160
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,794
I'M REALLY
NOT INTERESTED.

161
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,088
INTERESTED?

162
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,006
YOU WERE ABOUT TO TRY
TO SELL ME SOMETHING.

163
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,341
I WAS GOING TO SUGGEST

164
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,843
YOUR PARENTS
MIGHT APPRECIATE A MEMENTO.

165
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:57,347
AND YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE SEVERAL
TO CHOOSE FROM.

166
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,682
I DO CARRY A SELECT LINE

167
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,727
OF UNIQUE ARTIFACTS
AND GEMSTONES

168
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,354
INDIGENOUS
TO THIS REGION.

169
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,646
QUITE RECENTLY

170
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,149
I ACQUIRED
THESE LOBI CRYSTALS

171
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,819
FROM A VERY STRANGE
CREATURE CALLED A MORN.

172
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,448
WE WERE WARNED ABOUT THE FERENGI
AT THE ACADEMY.

173
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:17,284
WARNED ABOUT FERENGI, WERE YOU?

174
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,910
THAT'S RIGHT.

175
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,456
SLURS ABOUT MY PEOPLE
AT STARFLEET ACADEMY.

176
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,916
WHAT I MEANT WAS...
HERE I AM, TRYING TO BE

177
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,252
A CORDIAL HOST,
KNOWING HOW MUCH

178
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:30,297
A YOUNG OFFICER'S PARENTS
WOULD APPRECIATE

179
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:34,008
A TOKEN OF HIS LOVE ON THE EVE
OF A DANGEROUS MISSION

180
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,344
AND WHAT DO I GET
FOR MY TROUBLE?

181
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,887
SCURRILOUS INSULTS.

182
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,264
WELL, SOMEBODY'S

183
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,558
GOING TO HEAR
ABOUT THIS.

184
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,893
WHAT'S YOUR NAME, SON?

185
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,270
MY... NAME?

186
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,813
YOU HAVE ONE,
I PRESUME?

187
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,190
KIM, HARRY KIM, BUT I...

188
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,818
AND WHO WAS IT AT THE ACADEMY
WHO WARNED YOU ABOUT FERENGI?

189
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,946
I THINK A MEMENTO FOR MY PARENTS
WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA.

190
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,448
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

191
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:59,200
REALLY? ONE WOULD MAKE
A GREAT PENDANT FOR MY MOTHER.

192
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,077
OR CUFFLINKS
FOR YOUR FATHER.

193
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,079
CUFFLINKS. GREAT IDEA.

194
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,831
THEY'RE NOT FOR SALE.

195
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,042
NOW, INFORM YOUR
COMMANDING OFFICER

196
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:11,630
THAT THE FEDERATION COUNCIL
CAN EXPECT AN OFFICIAL QUERY...

197
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,382
HOW MUCH FOR THE ENTIRE TRAY?

198
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,885
CASH OR CREDIT?

199
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,971
DAZZLING,
AREN'T THEY?

200
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,931
AS BRIGHT AS A
KOLADAN DIAMOND.

201
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,391
BRIGHTER.

202
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,144
AND YOU CAN FIND THEM
ON ANY PLANET IN THIS SYSTEM.

203
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,188
THAT'S AN EXAGGERATION.

204
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,482
THERE'S A SHOP
AT THE VOLNAR COLONY

205
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,609
THAT SELLS
A DOZEN ASSORTED SHAPES

206
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,027
FOR ONE CARDASSIAN LEK.

207
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,237
HOW MUCH YOU
SELLING THESE FOR?

208
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,366
WE WERE JUST ABOUT
TO NEGOTIATE THE PRICE.

209
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,585
THANKS.

210
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,837
DIDN'T THEY WARN
YOU ABOUT FERENGI

211
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,172
AT THE ACADEMY?

212
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,391
RUN A LEVEL THREE DIAGNOSTIC
JUST TO BE SURE.

213
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,185
CAN I HELP YOU?

214
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,979
TOM PARIS,
REPORTING ON BOARD.

215
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,148
OH, YES.

216
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,650
THE OBSERVER.

217
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,151
Paris:
THAT'S ME.

218
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,446
AS A MATTER
OF FACT

219
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,822
I SEEM TO BE OBSERVING

220
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,116
SOME KIND OF PROBLEM
RIGHT NOW...

221
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,493
DOCTOR.

222
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:27,455
I WAS A SURGEON
AT THE HOSPITAL ON CALDIK PRIME

223
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,291
THE SAME TIME YOU WERE
STATIONED THERE.

224
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,211
WE NEVER ACTUALLY MET.

225
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,380
YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS
HAVE ARRIVED

226
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,382
FROM YOUR LAST POSTING,
MR. PARIS.

227
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,300
EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE
IN ORDER.

228
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,011
THE CAPTAIN ASKED
IF YOU WERE ON BOARD.

229
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,346
YOU SHOULD CHECK IN.

230
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:44,931
I HAVEN'T PAID
MY RESPECTS

231
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,891
TO THE CAPTAIN YET EITHER.

232
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:50,061
WELL, MR. KIM,
THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING

233
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:52,439
FOR A NEW
OPERATIONS OFFICER TO DO.

234
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,528
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

235
00:12:58,528 --> 00:12:59,654
IT'S A LONG STORY

236
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,489
AND I'M TIRED
OF TELLING IT.

237
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,200
I'M SURE SOMEONE WILL
TELL YOU BEFORE LONG.

238
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,827
Man:
The doctor called,
and I was right.

239
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,037
SHE'S PREGNANT?

240
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,872
Puppies are due
in seven weeks.

241
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,666
OH, TAKE HER HOME WITH YOU.

242
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,126
With me?

243
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,002
I just got the rugs cleaned.

244
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,255
I CAN'T LEAVE HER
IN A KENNEL WHILE I...

245
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:20,383
Is this another "love me,
love my dog" demand?

246
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,593
YES.

247
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,303
How could I
ever refuse you?

248
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,554
THANKS, HONEY.

249
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:25,846
When are you leaving?

250
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,182
AS SOON AS I APPROVE
THESE STATUS REPORTS.

251
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:31,227
All right, then I won't
bother you anymore.

252
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,853
HEY...

253
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,776
YOU NEVER BOTHER ME.

254
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,570
EXCEPT THE WAY I LOVE
TO BE BOTHERED.

255
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,820
UNDERSTAND?

256
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,448
I'll remember that.

257
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,949
SEE YOU IN A FEW WEEKS.

258
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,867
OH, MARK, GO BY MY HOUSE
AND PICK UP THE DOGGY BED.

259
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,495
SHE'LL BE MORE COMFORTABLE.

260
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,413
I already did.

261
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,332
An hour ago.

262
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,550
(<i> door chimes</i> )

263
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,968
COME IN.

264
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,474
GENTLEMEN,
WELCOME ABOARD<i> VOYAGER.</i>

265
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,351
THANK YOU, SIR.

266
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,312
MR. KIM...

267
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,523
AT EASE BEFORE YOU
SPRAIN SOMETHING.

268
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:20,026
ENSIGN, DESPITE
STARFLEET PROTOCOL

269
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,195
I DON'T LIKE
BEING ADDRESSED AS "SIR."

270
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,405
I'M SORRY... MA'AM.

271
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,449
"MA'AM" IS ACCEPTABLE
IN A CRUNCH.

272
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,201
BUT I PREFER "CAPTAIN."

273
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,495
WE'RE GETTING
READY TO LEAVE.

274
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,455
LET ME SHOW YOU TO THE BRIDGE.

275
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,791
DID YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS
GETTING HERE, MR. PARIS?

276
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,544
NONE AT ALL, CAPTAIN.

277
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:41,756
Janeway:
MY FIRST OFFICER,
LIEUTENANT COMMANDER CAVIT.

278
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,258
ENSIGN KIM,
MR. PARIS.

279
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,802
WELCOME ABOARD.

280
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,434
Janeway:
ENSIGN KIM

281
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,979
THIS IS YOUR STATION.

282
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,148
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE OVER?

283
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,358
YES, MA'AM.

284
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,152
IT'S NOT CRUNCH TIME YET,
MR. KIM.

285
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,488
I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN.

286
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,326
LIEUTENANT STADI,
LAY IN THE COURSE

287
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,829
AND CLEAR OUR DEPARTURE
WITH OPERATIONS.

288
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,540
COURSE ENTERED,
OPS HAS CLEARED US.

289
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,833
READY THRUSTERS.

290
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,042
THRUSTERS READY.

291
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,420
INITIATE
LAUNCHING SEQUENCE.

292
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,672
Stadi:
SEQUENCE UNDERWAY.

293
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,883
ENGAGE.

294
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,507
TOMATO SOUP.

295
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,886
There are 14 varieties
of tomato soup available

296
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,346
from this replicator--

297
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:15,850
with rice, with vegetables,
Bolian-style, with pasta...

298
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,101
PLAIN.

299
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,895
Specify hot or chilled.

300
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,146
HOT!

301
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:24,066
HOT, PLAIN TOMATO SOUP.

302
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,037
THERE, YOU SEE?

303
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,206
I TOLD YOU
IT WOULDN'T TAKE LONG.

304
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,502
IS IT TRUE?

305
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,629
WAS THE ACCIDENT MY FAULT?

306
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:49,091
YES-- PILOT ERROR-- BUT IT
TOOK ME A WHILE TO ADMIT IT.

307
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:55,014
UGH! 14 VARIETIES AND THEY CAN'T
GET PLAIN TOMATO SOUP RIGHT.

308
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,350
THEY SAID YOU
FALSIFIED REPORTS.

309
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,310
THAT'S RIGHT.
WHY?

310
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,228
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
I LIED.

311
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,732
BUT THEN YOU CAME FORWARD
AND ADMITTED IT WAS YOUR FAULT?

312
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,236
I'LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH, HARRY.

313
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,823
ALL I HAD TO DO
WAS KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT

314
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:15,368
AND I WAS HOME FREE,
BUT I COULDN'T.

315
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,579
THE GHOSTS OF THOSE
THREE DEAD OFFICERS

316
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,914
CAME TO ME
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

317
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,750
AND TAUGHT ME
THE TRUE MEANING OF CHRISTMAS.

318
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,336
SO I CONFESSED--

319
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:29,298
WORST MISTAKE I EVER MADE
BUT NOT MY LAST.

320
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,176
AFTER THEY CASHIERED ME
OUT OF STARFLEET

321
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:35,805
I WENT OUT LOOKING FOR A FIGHT
AND FOUND THE MAQUIS

322
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:39,642
AND ON MY FIRST ASSIGNMENT,
I WAS CAUGHT.

323
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,770
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
ESPECIALLY TOUGH FOR YOU

324
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,147
BEING THE SON
OF AN ADMIRAL.

325
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:48,943
FRANKLY, I THINK IT WAS TOUGHER
ON MY FATHER THAN IT WAS ON ME.

326
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:56,492
LOOK, I KNOW THOSE GUYS TOLD YOU
TO STAY AWAY FROM ME

327
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,160
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

328
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,538
YOU OUGHT TO LISTEN TO THEM.

329
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:03,499
I'M NOT EXACTLY
A GOOD-LUCK CHARM.

330
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:07,127
I DON'T NEED ANYONE
TO CHOOSE MY FRIENDS FOR ME.

331
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:10,006
Janeway to Paris.

332
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,257
GO AHEAD.

333
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,759
Report to the Bridge.

334
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,344
We're approaching the Badlands.

335
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:26,355
Man:
PLASMA STORMS WERE MEASURED AT
LEVELS THREE AND FOUR.

336
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,441
THE CARDASSIANS GAVE US
THE LAST KNOWN HEADING

337
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,193
OF THE MAQUIS SHIP,
AND WE HAVE CHARTS

338
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:35,031
OF THE PLASMA STORM ACTIVITY
THE DAY IT DISAPPEARED.

339
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:37,909
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO
APPROXIMATE ITS COURSE.

340
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,786
I'D GUESS THEY
WERE HEADING

341
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,622
TO ONE OF THE PLANETOIDS
IN THE TERIKOF BELT.

342
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,749
THE PLASMA STORMS
WOULD HAVE FORCED

343
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:46,751
THEM IN THIS DIRECTION.

344
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,836
Janeway:
ADJUST OUR COURSE TO MATCH.

345
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,380
THE CARDASSIANS CLAIM
THEY FORCED

346
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,340
THE MAQUIS SHIP
INTO A PLASMA STORM

347
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,885
WHERE IT WAS DESTROYED,
BUT THERE'S NO DEBRIS.

348
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,429
A PLASMA STORM
MIGHT NOT LEAVE ANY DEBRIS.

349
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,473
WE'D STILL BE ABLE TO PICK UP

350
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,725
A RESONANCE TRACE
FROM THE WARP CORE.

351
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:03,977
CAPTAIN,
I'M READING

352
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,186
A COHERENT TETRION BEAM
SCANNING US.

353
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,897
ORIGIN, MR. KIM?

354
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,691
NOT SURE. THERE'S ALSO
A DISPLACEMENT WAVE

355
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,318
MOVING TOWARD US.

356
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,611
Janeway:
ON SCREEN.

357
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:16,363
ANALYSIS.

358
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:19,158
SOME KIND OF POLARIZED
MAGNETIC VARIATION.

359
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,703
WE MIGHT DISPERSE IT
WITH A GRAVITON PARTICLE FIELD.

360
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,163
DO IT.
RED ALERT.

361
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,915
MOVE US AWAY FROM
IT, LIEUTENANT.

362
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:29,043
NEW HEADING 4-1 MARK 1-8-0.

363
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,800
INITIATING GRAVITON FIELD.

364
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,971
GRAVITON FIELD HAD NO EFFECT.

365
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:42,222
FULL IMPULSE.

366
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,144
Kim:
<i>THE WAVE WILL INTERCEPT US</i>

367
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:47,854
IN 12 SECONDS.

368
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,396
CAN WE GO TO WARP?

369
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,691
NOT UNTIL WE CLEAR
THE PLASMA FIELD.

370
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,776
Kim:
FIVE SECONDS.

371
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,319
BRACE FOR IMPACT.

372
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,612
THREE...

373
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,337
(<i> Paris groans</i> )

374
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,399
REPORT.

375
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,403
HULL BREACH, DECK 14. COM LINES
TO ENGINEERING ARE DOWN.

376
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,405
TRYING TO REESTABLISH.

377
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:43,576
REPAIR CREWS, SEAL OFF
HULL BREACH ON DECK 14.

378
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,744
Aye, Captain.

379
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,496
Crewman:
CASUALTY REPORTS
COMING IN.

380
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,665
SICK BAY IS
NOT RESPONDING.

381
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,084
BRIDGE TO SICK BAY.

382
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,877
DOCTOR, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

383
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:55,295
PARIS,
HOW'S STADI?

384
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,964
SHE'S DEAD.

385
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,340
SOMETHING'S OUT THERE.

386
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,968
I NEED A BETTER DESCRIPTION
THAN THAT, MR. KIM.

387
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,261
I DON'T KNOW.

388
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,972
I'M NOT SURE WHAT I'M READING.

389
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,891
CAN YOU GET
THE VIEWSCREEN OPERATIONAL?

390
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:09,560
I'M TRYING.

391
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,074
CAPTAIN

392
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,034
IF THESE SENSORS ARE WORKING

393
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:28,454
WE'RE OVER 70,000 LIGHT YEARS
FROM WHERE WE WERE.

394
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:31,290
WE'RE ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE GALAXY.

395
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,428
I'M NOT READING
ANY LIFE SIGNS

396
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,679
ON THE MAQUIS SHIP.

397
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,723
WHAT ABOUT ON THAT...
THAT ARRAY?

398
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,725
OUR SENSORS CAN'T
PENETRATE IT.

399
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,727
ANY IDEA WHAT
THOSE PULSES ARE?

400
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,729
MASSIVE BURSTS
OF RADIANT ENERGY.

401
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,232
DIRECTED TOWARD A NEARBY
G-TYPE STAR SYSTEM.

402
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:57,900
TRY HAILING THE ARRAY.

403
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,443
Engineering to bridge.

404
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:02,071
We have severe damage.
The Chief's dead.

405
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,240
Possibility
of a warp core breach.

406
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,408
SECURE ALL SYSTEMS.
I'M ON MY WAY.

407
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,119
NO RESPONSE
FROM THE ARRAY.

408
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,996
ENSIGN, GET DOWN TO SICK BAY.

409
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,290
MR. ROLLINS,
THE BRIDGE IS YOURS.

410
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,462
HARRY, WAIT FOR ME.

411
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:35,980
THEY MUST HAVE BEEN
RIGHT NEXT TO THE CONSOLE

412
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,439
WHEN IT EXPLODED.

413
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:53,289
Warning.
Warp core micro-fracture.

414
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,457
Breach imminent.

415
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,459
WHAT'S THE WARP CORE PRESSURE?

416
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,212
MAN:
2100 KILOPASCALS.

417
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:02,882
LOCK DOWN
THE MAGNETIC CONSTRICTORS.

418
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,343
IF WE LOCK THEM DOWN
AT THESE PRESSURE LEVELS

419
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:07,553
WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE
TO REINITIALIZE

420
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:08,971
THE DILITHIUM REACTION.

421
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,389
Warning.
Warp core microfracture.

422
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:13,017
WE'VE GOT TO GET

423
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:16,020
THE REACTION RATE DOWN
BEFORE WE TRY TO SEAL IT.

424
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,898
COMPUTER, INITIATE EMERGENCY
MEDICAL HOLOGRAPHIC PROGRAM.

425
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:24,278
STATE THE NATURE
OF THE MEDICAL EMERGENCY.

426
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:25,445
MULTIPLE INJURIES.

427
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,698
STATUS OF DOCTOR?
HE'S DEAD.

428
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,033
.4cc's OF TRIANOLINE.

429
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,534
TRIANOLINE?

430
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,245
WE LOST OUR NURSE TOO.

431
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:35,748
HOW SOON ARE REPLACEMENT
MEDICAL PERSONNEL EXPECTED?

432
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,833
THAT COULD BE
A PROBLEM.

433
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,544
WE'RE PRETTY FAR AWAY
FROM REPLACEMENTS.

434
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,714
TRICORDER.

435
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,719
<i>MEDICAL</i> TRICORDER.

436
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,267
(<i> sighs</i> )

437
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,188
A REPLACEMENT MUST BE REQUESTED
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

438
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,522
I AM PROGRAMMED

439
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,192
ONLY AS A SHORT-TERM
EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENT.

440
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,694
WE MAY BE STUCK WITH YOU
FOR A WHILE.

441
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,363
NO NEED FOR CONCERN.

442
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:10,448
I AM CAPABLE OF TREATING
ANY INJURY OR DISEASE.

443
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,243
NO CONCUSSION.
YOU'LL BE FINE.

444
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:13,577
CLEAN HIM UP.

445
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,256
UNLOCK THE MAGNETIC
CONSTRICTORS.

446
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:31,095
Man:
CONSTRICTORS ON-LINE.

447
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,721
PRESSURE?

448
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:36,558
2,500 KILOPASCALS
AND HOLDING.

449
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,603
Bridge to Janeway. We're being
scanned by the array, Captain.

450
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,439
It penetrated our shields.

451
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:43,107
WHAT KIND OF SCAN?

452
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,442
BRIDGE?

453
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:47,403
JANEWAY TO BRIDGE. RESPOND.

454
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:50,488
INITIATE EMERGENCY LOCK OFF.

455
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,622
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUSLY HURT.

456
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,666
YOU CAN RETURN TO YOUR STATION.

457
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:13,429
THIS IS THE EMERGENCY
HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR SPEAKING.

458
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:14,930
I GAVE NO PERMISSION

459
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:18,476
FOR ANYONE TO BE TRANSPORTED
OUT OF SICK BAY.

460
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:19,935
HELLO.

461
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,812
SICK BAY TO BRIDGE.

462
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:26,817
I BELIEVE SOMEONE HAS FAILED
TO TERMINATE MY PROGRAM.

463
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,319
PLEASE RESPOND.

464
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,959
COME UP HERE.

465
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,336
COME ON NOW.

466
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:47,171
I HAVE A PITCHER

467
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:49,715

AND SOME SUGAR COOKIES.

468
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,429
CAPTAIN.

469
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:57,806
DON'T BELIEVE YOUR EYES,
MR. PARIS.

470
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,309
WE'VE ONLY TRANSPORTED
100 KILOMETERS.

471
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:01,768
WE'RE INSIDE THE ARRAY.

472
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:05,314
Kim:
THERE'S NO INDICATION
OF STABLE MATTER.

473
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:08,192
THIS MUST BE SOME KIND
OF HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION.

474
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,861
OH, YOU POOR THINGS.
YOU MUST BE TIRED.

475
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,905
SIT DOWN AND REST A WHILE.

476
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,281
HAVE A COLD DRINK.

477
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,408
NO, THANK YOU.

478
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,368
MY NAME IS
KATHRYN JANEWAY

479
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:18,994
CAPTAIN OF THE FEDERATION

00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,163
STARSHIP<i> VOYAGER.</i>

481
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:23,416
JUST MAKE YOURSELVES
RIGHT AT HOME.

482
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,792
THE NEIGHBORS SHOULD
BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

483
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,503
WHY, HERE THEY ARE.

484
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:37,595
WE'RE REAL GLAD
YOU DROPPED BY.

485
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:39,348
NOW WE CAN GET STARTED.

486
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:43,519
YOU ARE ALL INVITED
TO THE WELCOMING BEE!

487
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,479
LET'S HAVE SOME MUSIC!

488
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:48,274
(<i> laughing</i> )

489
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:51,527
(<i> playing country music</i> )

490
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:10,129
(<i> playing banjo music</i> )

491
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:20,139
THE CREW'S SCATTERED
AROUND THIS FARM, CAPTAIN

492
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,640
BUT THEY'RE ALL
ACCOUNTED FOR.

493
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,103
MOVE AROUND. SCAN THE AREA.
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND ANYTHING

494
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:28,147
THAT MIGHT BE
A HOLOGRAPHIC GENERATOR.

495
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:32,359
HAVE SOME NICE FRESH
CORN ON THE COB.

496
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:35,362
FRESH CORN ON THE COB.

497
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,989
CORN ON THE COB?

498
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,656
CORN ON THE COB?

499
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:40,576
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHY WE'RE HERE?

500
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:43,078
WE DON'T MEAN
YOU ANY HARM.

501
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,414
I'M SORRY IF WE'VE
PUT YOU OUT.

502
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:46,999
JUST PUT YOUR FEET UP

503
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,335
AND GET COMFORTABLE
WHILE YOU WAIT.

504
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:50,586
WAIT FOR WHAT?

505
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:53,255
ISN'T ANYBODY HUNGRY?

506
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,424
MAKE YOURSELVES AT HOME.

507
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:58,010
I'M SORRY IF WE
PUT YOU OUT.

508
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,441
LET ME SHOW YOU AROUND.

509
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,818
THE ROOT CELLAR'S
RIGHT OVER THERE.

510
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,236
WHAT'S DOWN THERE?

511
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,613
POTATOES, ONIONS.

512
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:20,157
BUT IT'S REAL PRIVATE.

513
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:22,075
PARIS, SHE'S ONLY

514
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,369
A HOLOGRAM.

515
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:26,079
NO REASON
TO BE RUDE.

516
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,040
WHOA.
WHAT?

517
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,459
SPOROCYSTIAN LIFE SIGNS.

518
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,508
WHAT'S IN THE BARN?

519
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:39,885
OH, NOTHING
BUT A BIG OL' PILE OF HAY.

520
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,555
LET'S GO SEE
THE DUCK POND.

521
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,723
IT'S JUST
A DARK SMELLY BARN.

522
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,976
HEY, DO Y'ALL WANT
SOME DEVILED EGGS?

523
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,984
SEE? NOTHING BUT HAY.

524
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,320
THERE'S A LIFE-FORM HERE.
JUST ONE.

525
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,863
WHERE?

526
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,948
IT'S EVERYWHERE.

527
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:04,159
I'M ALSO READING SOME KIND

528
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,745
OF MATRIX PROCESSING
DEVICE.

529
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,373
MAYBE THE HOLOGRAPHIC
GENERATOR.

530
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:10,790
PARIS.

531
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,793
HUMANOID LIFE SIGNS
OVER HERE.

532
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:16,838
I'M READING A VULCAN AND SEVERAL
HUMANS.

533
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,216
I'M NOT READY FOR YOU YET!

534
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:22,177
(<i> dog barking</i> )

535
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,724
PARIS TO JANEWAY.

536
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:29,309
JANEWAY HERE.

537
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,603
PARIS?

538
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,063
COME ON.

539
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,959
VERY WELL.

540
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,587
SINCE NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE FOR
ANY CORN,

541
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:59,298
WE'LL HAVE TO PROCEED
AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.

542
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:53,059
(<i> moaning</i> )

543
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,003
(<i> screaming</i> )

544
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,140
JANEWAY TO BRIDGE.
ANYBODY THERE?

545
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,100
Yes, Captain, we're here.

546
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,019
HOW LONG WERE WE OVER THERE?

547
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,564
ALMOST THREE DAYS.

548
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:40,524
Three days.

549
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:44,152
CAPTAIN, THE MAQUIS SHIP
IS POWERING UP ITS ENGINES.

550
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,029
TRACTOR THEM.
ALL SENIOR OFFICERS REPORT

551
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,906
to the bridge immediately.

552
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,534
COULD YOU EXPLAIN
WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED?

553
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,536
COMPUTER, LOCATE ENSIGN KIM.

554
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:54,496
Ensign Kim is not on board.

555
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,164
PARIS TO JANEWAY.

556
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,957
Go ahead.

557
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,793
Kim didn't come back with us.

558
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,127
ACKNOWLEDGED.

559
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:04,089
COMPUTER, HOW MANY CREWMEN
ARE UNACCOUNTED FOR?

560
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,549
One: Ensign Harry Kim.

561
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:06,884
HAIL THE MAQUIS.

562
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,720
COMMANDER CHAKOTAY

563
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,222
MY NAME IS
CAPTAIN KATHRYN JANEWAY.

564
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:13,849
How do you know my name?

565
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:15,141
WE WERE ON A MISSION
TO FIND YOU

566
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,728
WHEN WE WERE BROUGHT HERE
BY THE ARRAY.

567
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:19,563
ONE OF OUR CREWMEN IS MISSING.

568
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:22,148
WAS HE TRANSPORTED
TO YOUR SHIP BY ACCIDENT?

569
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:25,026
No. A member of our crew
is missing too.

570
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,153
B'Elanna Torres,
my engineer.

571
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:30,073
COMMANDER, YOU AND I
HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.

572
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:33,702
I THINK IT MAKES SENSE
TO TRY AND SOLVE IT TOGETHER

573
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,287
DON'T YOU?

574
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:42,502
Three of us will transport
to your ship.

575
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:45,046
THEY'RE POWERING DOWN
THEIR ENGINES

576
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,924
DROPPING THEIR SHIELDS.

577
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:53,305
WATCH OUT, CAPTAIN.
THEY'RE ARMED.

578
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,515
PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPONS.

579
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:59,895
YOU WON'T NEED
THOSE HERE.

580
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:03,523
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK,
MR. TUVOK.

581
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,943
I MUST INFORM YOU

582
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:09,279
THAT I WAS ASSIGNED
TO INFILTRATE YOUR CREW, SIR.

583
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,282
I AM CAPTAIN JANEWAY'S
CHIEF OF SECURITY.

584
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:14,910
WERE YOU GOING
TO DELIVER US

585
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,954
INTO THEIR WAITING HANDS,
VULCAN?

586
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:19,748
MY MISSION WAS
TO ACCUMULATE INFORMATION

587
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,416
ON MAQUIS ACTIVITIES

588
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,461
AND THEN DELIVER YOU
INTO THEIR "WAITING HANDS."

589
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:25,796
THAT IS CORRECT.

590
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:27,589
I SEE YOU HAD HELP.

591
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,133
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO,
CHAKOTAY.

592
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,551
AT LEAST THE VULCAN

593
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:34,220
WAS DOING HIS DUTY
AS A STARFLEET OFFICER

594
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,514
BUT YOU...

595
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,307
YOU BETRAYED US
FOR WHAT?

596
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,434
FREEDOM FROM PRISON? LATINUM?

597
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,896
WHAT WAS YOUR PRICE
THIS TIME?

598
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:45,106
YOU ARE SPEAKING
TO A MEMBER OF MY CREW.

599
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:48,360
I EXPECT YOU TO TREAT HIM
WITH THE SAME RESPECT

600
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,780
AS YOU WOULD HAVE ME TREAT
A MEMBER OF YOURS.

601
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,118
Janeway:
NOW, WE HAVE A LOT
TO ACCOMPLISH

602
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,912
AND I SUGGEST
WE ALL CONCENTRATE

603
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:01,373
ON FINDING OUR PEOPLE
AND GETTING OURSELVES HOME.

604
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,834
BASED ON MY INITIAL
RECONNAISSANCE, I AM CONVINCED

605
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:06,795
WE ARE DEALING WITH
A SINGLE ENTITY IN THE ARRAY.

606
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:09,506
I WOULD SUGGEST
HE SCANNED OUR COMPUTERS

607
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:12,342
IN ORDER TO SELECT A COMFORTABLE
HOLOGRAPHIC ENVIRONMENT.

608
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:15,220
IN EFFECT, A WAITING ROOM

609
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,639
TO PACIFY US
PRIOR TO BIOMETRIC ASSESSMENT.

610
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,141
AN EXAMINATION?

611
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,561
IT IS THE MOST
LOGICAL EXPLANATION.

612
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:25,605
WHY ELSE WOULD HE HAVE
RELEASED US UNHARMED?

613
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,733
NOT ALL OF US WERE.

614
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:32,029
BREAK OUT THE COMPRESSION
PHASER RIFLES.

615
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:34,280
MEET US IN TRANSPORTER ROOM TWO.

616
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,615
WE'RE GOING BACK.

617
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:38,493
MR. TUVOK, WHILE CHAKOTAY
AND I ARE LOOKING

618
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,953
FOR TORRES AND KIM

619
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:43,164
YOUR JOB IS TO FIND OUT
AS MUCH ABOUT THIS ARRAY

620
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,374
AS YOU CAN.

621
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:46,001
IT BROUGHT US HERE.

622
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:49,046
WE HAVE TO ASSUME
IT CAN SEND US HOME.

623
00:34:49,046 --> 00:34:50,338
AGREED?

624
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:54,801
MR. ROLLINS,

625
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,094
MAINTAIN RED ALERT.

626
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,471
KEEP US ON CONSTANT
TRANSPORTER LOCKS.

627
00:34:58,471 --> 00:34:59,806
CAPTAIN.

628
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:03,852
I'D LIKE TO GO WITH YOU.

629
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:06,688
IF THIS HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH CHAKOTAY...

630
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:09,232
IT DOESN'T.
I JUST...

631
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:12,360
I'D HATE TO SEE
ANYTHING HAPPEN TO HARRY.

632
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:15,530
COME ON.

633
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:41,180
THERE ARE NO HUMANOID
LIFE-FORMS INDICATED, CAPTAIN.

634
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,599
KIM AND TORRES

635
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,768
ARE NOT WITHIN
TRICORDER RANGE.

636
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,895
HE CAN TELL US
WHERE THEY ARE.

637
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,647
MAINTAIN YOUR COM LINK.

638
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,816
I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE ANYONE ELSE.

639
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:53,860
(<i> softly strumming banjo</i> )

640
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,163
OH, WHY HAVE YOU COME BACK?

641
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,206
YOU DON'T HAVE WHAT I NEED.

642
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:09,876
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU NEED
AND I DON'T CARE.

643
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,753
I JUST WANT
OUR PEOPLE BACK

644
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:14,047
AND I WANT US ALL
TO BE SENT HOME.

645
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:16,591
WELL, NOW,
AREN'T YOU CONTENTIOUS

646
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,011
FOR A MINOR BIPEDAL SPECIES.

647
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:21,220
THIS MINOR BIPEDAL SPECIES

648
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,390
DOESN'T TAKE KINDLY
TO BEING ABDUCTED.

649
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,143
IT WAS NECESSARY.

650
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:27,602
WHERE ARE OUR PEOPLE?

651
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,812
THEY'RE NOT HERE.

652
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:30,105
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

653
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:32,607
YOU DON'T HAVE WHAT I NEED.

654
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,859
THEY MIGHT.

655
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,610
NO. YOU'LL HAVE TO LEAVE THEM.

656
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,654
WE WON'T DO THAT.

657
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,906
WE ARE THEIR COMMANDING
OFFICERS.

658
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,159
WE ARE ENTRUSTED
WITH THEIR SAFETY.

659
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,911
THAT MAY BE A CONCEPT
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

660
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:48,081
OH, NO. I DO UNDERSTAND

661
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:51,168
BUT I HAVE NO CHOICE.

662
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:57,007
THERE JUST IS
NOT ENOUGH TIME LEFT.

663
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:58,633
LEFT FOR WHAT?

664
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:02,012
I MUST HONOR A DEBT
THAT CAN NEVER BE REPAID

665
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:05,807
BUT MY SEARCH HAS
NOT BEEN GOING WELL.

666
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:11,188
TELL US WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

667
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:13,398
MAYBE WE CAN
HELP YOU FIND IT.

668
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:14,691
YOU?

669
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:16,442
(<i> laughs</i> )

670
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:17,736
I'VE SEARCHED THE GALAXY

671
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,821
WITH METHODS BEYOND
YOUR COMPREHENSION.

672
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:23,033
NO. THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO.

673
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:25,869
YOU'VE TAKEN US 70,000
LIGHT YEARS FROM OUR HOME.

674
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:27,913
WE HAVE NO WAY BACK
UNLESS YOU SEND US

675
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:30,373
AND WE WON'T LEAVE
WITHOUT THE OTHERS

676
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:34,211
BUT SENDING YOU BACK
IS TERRIBLY COMPLICATED.

677
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:35,879
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

678
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:38,173
I DON'T HAVE TIME.

679
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:39,716
NOT ENOUGH TIME!

680
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,749

00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,714
WHERE AM I?

684
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,092
PLEASE DON'T TRY
TO MOVE YET.

685
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:23,593
YOU'RE VERY ILL.

686
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:25,887
ILL? NO, NO. THERE'S SOME
MISTAKE. I'M NOT...

687
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:37,565
NO!

<i>STARDATE 48315.6.</i>

691
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:29,242

COME IN.

698
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:49,262
CAPTAIN, I'VE OBSERVED
SOMETHING PECULIAR

699
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:50,596
ABOUT THE PULSES.

700
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:53,516
THEY'RE GETTING FASTER.

701
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:54,893
FASTER.

702
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,853
THE INTERVAL
BETWEEN EACH PULSE

703
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,855
HAS DECREASED
BY .47 SECONDS

704
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:00,065
SINCE WE ARRIVED.

705
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:02,192
I CAN OFFER
NO EXPLANATION.

706
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:04,277
THAT'S ONLY ONE
OF THE MYSTERIES

707
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:05,528
WE'RE DEALING WITH.

708
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,322
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

709
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,450
IT'S VIRTUALLY
A DESERT.

710
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,620
NOT ONE OCEAN.
NOT ONE RIVER.

711
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,414
IT HAS ALL THE BASIC
CHARACTERISTICS

712
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,333
OF AN M-CLASS PLANET,
EXCEPT...

713
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:21,002
THERE ARE NO
NUCLEOGENIC PARTICLES

714
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:22,295
IN THE ATMOSPHERE.

715
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:24,756
THAT WOULD MEAN
THE PLANET IS INCAPABLE

716
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,091
OF PRODUCING RAIN.

717
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:28,927
I'VE STUDIED THOUSANDS
OF M-CLASS PLANETS.

718
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:32,347
I'VE NEVER SEEN AN ATMOSPHERE
WITHOUT NUCLEOGENICS.

719
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:34,015
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN

720
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:36,726
SOME KIND OF EXTRAORDINARY
ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER.

721
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:43,858
AS SOON AS REPAIRS
ARE COMPLETE...

722
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,864
WE'LL SET A COURSE
FOR THE FIFTH PLANET.

723
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:55,536
CAPTAIN.

724
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,747
YOU REQUIRE SLEEP.

725
00:40:57,747 --> 00:41:01,918
KIM'S MOTHER CALLED ME
JUST AFTER HE LEFT EARTH.

726
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:04,462
DELIGHTFUL WOMAN.

727
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,006
HE'S HER ONLY SON.

728
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,134
HE'D LEFT HIS CLARINET BEHIND.

729
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:11,677
SHE WANTED TO KNOW
IF SHE HAD TIME

730
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,763
TO SEND IT.

731
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:16,391
I HAD TO TELL HER NO.

732
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,019
DO YOU KNOW
HE PLAYED THE CLARINET

733
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,021
IN THE JUILLIARD YOUTH SYMPHONY?

734
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:25,233
I DID NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY
TO MEET MR. KIM.

735
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,860
I BARELY KNEW HIM.

736
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:32,907
I NEVER SEEM TO HAVE THE CHANCE
TO GET TO KNOW ANY OF THEM.

737
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:39,122
I HAVE TO, UM...

738
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:43,335
I HAVE TO TAKE MORE TIME
TO DO THAT.

739
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:47,713
IT'S A FINE CREW
AND I'VE GOT TO GET THEM HOME.

740
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:51,217
THE CREW WILL NOT BENEFIT
FROM THE LEADERSHIP

741
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,428
OF AN EXHAUSTED CAPTAIN.

742
00:41:56,306 --> 00:41:58,308
YOU'RE RIGHT AS USUAL.

743
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:01,769
I'VE MISSED YOUR COUNSEL, TUVOK.

744
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,563
I AM GRATIFIED
THAT YOU CAME AFTER ME

745
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,441
SO I CAN OFFER IT ONCE AGAIN.

746
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:09,319
I SPOKE TO YOUR FAMILY
BEFORE I LEFT.

747
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:11,696
ARE THEY WELL?

748
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:14,240
WELL, BUT WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

749
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,785
THAT WOULD NOT BE
AN ACCURATE PERCEPTION, CAPTAIN.

750
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,413
VULCANS DO NOT WORRY.

751
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:24,459
THEY... MISS YOU.

752
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:28,296
AS I DO THEM.

753
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:36,179
I'LL GET YOU
BACK TO THEM.

754
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:38,306
THAT'S A PROMISE, TUVOK.

755
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,196
<i>CAPTAIN'S LOG, SUPPLEMENTAL:</i>

756
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:56,491
VOYAGER<i> AND THE MAQUIS SHIP</i>
<i>HAVE ENTERED A DEBRIS FIELD</i>

757
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:59,244
<i>WHERE SENSORS HAVE DETECTED</i>
<i>A SMALL VESSEL.</i>

758
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:01,579
<i>ONE HUMANOID LIFE-FORM</i>
<i>IS ON BOARD.</i>

759
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,081
HAIL THEM.

760
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:10,505
(<i> clanging and clattering</i> )

761
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:18,012
Whoever you are, I found
this waste zone first.

762
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:21,307
WE'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN THIS DEBRIS, MISTER...?

763
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,184
Neelix.

764
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:28,189
And since you're not interested
in my "debris"

765
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:31,401
well, I'm delighted to know you.

766
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,027
CAPTAIN KATHRYN JANEWAY

767
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,530
OF THE FEDERATION STARSHIP
<i>VOYAGER.</i>

768
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,574
A very impressive title.

769
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:39,534
I have no idea what it means

770
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:42,120
but it sounds very impressive.

771
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,706
DO YOU KNOW THIS AREA
OF SPACE WELL, MR. NEELIX?

772
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,041
I am famous

773
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,585
for knowing it well.

774
00:43:48,585 --> 00:43:50,669
How may I be of service?

775
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:52,464
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE ARRAY

776
00:43:52,464 --> 00:43:55,383
THAT'S SENDING ENERGY PULSES
TO THE FIFTH PLANET?

777
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:56,634
I know enough

778
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,304
to stay as far away from it
as possible.

779
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:02,848
Wait, let me guess.

780
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:05,477
You were whisked away

781
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:07,853
from somewhere else
in the galaxy

782
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:10,189
and brought here
against your will.

783
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:13,692
SOUNDS AS THOUGH YOU'VE HEARD
THIS STORY BEFORE.

784
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:16,654
Sadly, yes, thousands of times.

785
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,656
Well, hundreds of times.

786
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,032
Maybe 50 times.

787
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:22,368
But the caretaker
has been bringing

788
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,412
ships here for months now.

789
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:26,872
THE CARETAKER?

790
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:30,502
That's what the Ocampa call him.

791
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:33,296
They live on the fifth planet.

792
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:37,258
Did he kidnap members
of your crew?

793
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:39,677
AS A MATTER OF FACT, HE DID.

794
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,054
It's not the first time.

795
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:44,056
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE HE'S TAKEN THEM?

796
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:47,226
Just that they're brought
to the Ocampa.

797
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:49,145
Nothing more.

798
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:51,688
WE'D APPRECIATE ANY HELP
YOU COULD GIVE US

799
00:44:51,688 --> 00:44:53,316
IN FINDING THESE OCAMPA.

800
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:56,277
I-I-I really wish
that I could help you, I do.

801
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:57,903
But as you can see

802
00:44:57,903 --> 00:45:01,366
there's just so much debris
for me to investigate today.

803
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:04,327
You'd be surprised
the things of value

804
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:06,496
some people abandon.

805
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:09,290
OF COURSE, WE'D COMPENSATE YOU
FOR YOUR TROUBLE.

806
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:14,962
Well, there's really very little
that you could offer me.

807
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,713
Unless...

808
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:18,216
YES?

809
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:20,593
Unless, of course

810
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:22,719
you had...

811
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:24,930
...water?

812
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:30,102
IF YOU HELP US FIND
OUR MISSING CREW MEMBERS

813
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:33,314
YOU CAN HAVE
ALL THE WATER YOU WANT.

814
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:39,153
Well, that... that sounds like
a very reasonable arrangement.

815
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,779
GOOD. WE'LL BEAM YOU OVER

816
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:43,241
AND TOW YOUR SHIP
INTO OUR SHUTTLE BAY.

817
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:46,869
MR. TUVOK, GO TO TRANSPORTER
ROOM TWO AND MEET OUR GUEST.

818
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:48,454
Beam?

819
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,164
WE HAVE A TECHNOLOGY

820
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:53,251
WHICH CAN TAKE YOU INSTANTLY
FROM YOUR SHIP TO OURS.

821
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:54,793
IT'S QUITE HARMLESS.

822
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:56,087
MAY WE?

823
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:04,429
ENERGIZE.

824
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:17,066
ASTONISHING!

825
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:18,817
YOU FEDERATIONS

826
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:21,237
ARE OBVIOUSLY
AN ADVANCED CULTURE.

827
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:24,115
THE FEDERATION IS MADE UP
OF MANY CULTURES.

828
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:25,533
I AM VULCAN.

829
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,452
NEELIX.

830
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:31,956
GOOD TO MEET YOU.

831
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:34,584
INTERESTING.

832
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:37,754
WHAT, WHAT EXACTLY...

833
00:46:37,754 --> 00:46:39,631
(<i> laughing</i> )

834
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:40,839
WHAT EXACTLY

835
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,717
DOES ALL THIS...

836
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:44,051
ALL THIS DO?

837
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:47,179
I ASSURE YOU
THAT EVERYTHING IN THIS ROOM

838
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:49,014
HAS A SPECIFIC FUNCTION.

839
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:52,351
HOWEVER, IT WOULD TAKE
SEVERAL HOURS TO EXPLAIN IT ALL.

840
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,687
I SUGGEST WE PROCEED
TO YOUR QUARTERS.

841
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:55,980
OH.

842
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,609
PERHAPS YOU WOULD CARE
FOR A BATH.

843
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:01,818
A WHAT?

844
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:03,696
HMM...

845
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:20,837
IT'S OKAY.

846
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:23,090
IT'S OKAY.
WHO ARE YOU?

847
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,718
MY NAME IS KIM--
HARRY KIM.

848
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:27,512
I'M AN ENSIGN ON
THE STARSHIP<i> VOYAGER.</i>

849
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:30,014
I WAS KIDNAPPED
FROM THE ARRAY

850
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,390
JUST LIKE YOU WERE.

851
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,434
WHAT WAS STARFLEET DOING
AT THAT ARRAY?

852
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:35,728
WE WERE LOOKING
FOR YOU, ACTUALLY.

853
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:37,896
WE'RE IN THE
BADLANDS, THEN...

854
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:39,982
YOU MEAN YOU WERE
TRYING TO CAPTURE US.

855
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:42,652
YEAH... CONSIDER
YOURSELF CAPTURED.

856
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:45,196
OH, I KNOW I HAVE
A PHASER HERE SOMEWHERE.

857
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:47,365
I DON'T FIND THIS
AMUSING, STARFLEET.

858
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:51,744
Kim:
THERE'S NO POINT.

859
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:53,954
IT'S LOCKED.

860
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,625
HEY, WHAT'S THAT GOING
TO ACCOMPLISH?

861
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,001
WHAT ARE THEY
DOING TO US?

862
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:01,086
WHAT ARE THESE THINGS
GROWING ON US?

863
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:03,548
DO YOU WANT THEM
TO SEDATE YOU AGAIN?

864
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:06,967
(<i> panting</i> )

865
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,136
YOU'RE RIGHT, STARFLEET.

866
00:48:14,851 --> 00:48:17,061
IT'S THE KLINGON HALF OF ME.

867
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:20,356
IT'S JUST IT'S HARD
TO CONTROL IT SOMETIMES.

868
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:28,989
WHAT'S YOUR NAME, MAQUIS?

869
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:37,289
B'ELANNA.

870
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:39,500
B'ELANNA TORRES.

871
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,920
I HOPE YOU'RE
FEELING BETTER.

872
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,050
I KNOW HOW FRIGHTENING ALL THIS
MUST BE FOR BOTH OF YOU.

873
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,802
I'VE BROUGHT SOME CLOTHES

874
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:51,136
IF YOU CARE TO CHANGE.

875
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:52,889
WHY ARE YOU
HOLDING US HERE?

876
00:48:52,889 --> 00:48:54,682
YOU ARE NOT PRISONERS.

877
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:57,810
IN FACT,
WE CONSIDER YOU HONORED GUESTS.

878
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,978
THE CARETAKER HAS SENT YOU
TO US.

879
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,898
AS LONG AS YOU ARE NOT VIOLENT

880
00:49:01,898 --> 00:49:04,442
YOU ARE FREE
TO LEAVE YOUR QUARTERS.

881
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:07,361
WHAT'S WRONG WITH US?

882
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,821
WHAT ARE THESE THINGS?

883
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:11,532
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW.

884
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:14,951
YOU MUST BE HUNGRY.

885
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:18,247
WOULD YOU CARE TO JOIN ME
ON THE COURTYARD FOR A MEAL?

886
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:24,128
OUR FOOD DISPENSERS
ARE RIGHT THIS WAY.

887
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:29,842
WE'RE UNDERGROUND.

888
00:49:29,842 --> 00:49:33,095
Ocampa Doctor:
OUR SOCIETY IS SUBTERRANEAN.

889
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:36,641
WE'VE LIVED HERE
FOR OVER 500 GENERATIONS.

890
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:39,059
BEFORE THAT,
YOU LIVED ON THE SURFACE?

891
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,686
UNTIL THE WARMING BEGAN.

892
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:41,938
THE WARMING?

893
00:49:41,938 --> 00:49:44,106
WHEN OUR SURFACE
TURNED INTO A DESERT

894
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:46,692
AND THE CARETAKER CAME
TO PROTECT US.

895
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:49,445
OUR ANCIENT JOURNALS
TELL US HE OPENED

896
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:51,447
A DEEP CHASM
IN THE GROUND

897
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:54,074
AND LED OUR ANCESTORS
TO THIS PLACE.

898
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:57,286
SINCE THEN, HE HAS PROVIDED
FOR ALL OUR NEEDS.

899
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:04,293
OH, PLEASE FORGIVE THEM.

900
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:07,296
THEY KNOW YOU'VE COME
FROM THE CARETAKER.

901
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:09,757
NONE OF US HAS EVER SEEN HIM.

902
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:11,550
THIS WAY, PLEASE.

903
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:26,482
DOES THE CARETAKER
PROVIDE YOUR MEALS TOO?

904
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:27,733
IN FACT, HE DOES.

905
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,193
HE DESIGNED

906
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:32,446
AND BUILT THIS ENTIRE CITY
FOR US AFTER THE WARMING.

907
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:35,950
THE FOOD PROCESSORS DISPENSE
NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS

908
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,576
EVERY 4.1 INTERVALS.

909
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:40,913
IT MAY NOT OFFER
THE EXOTIC TASTE

910
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:43,749
SOME OF OUR YOUNGER PEOPLE
CRAVE THESE DAYS

911
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:47,043
BUT IT MEETS OUR NEEDS.

912
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:51,423
Kim:
IS THIS HOW THE CARETAKER
COMMUNICATES WITH YOU?

913
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:54,050
Doctor:
HE NEVER COMMUNICATES DIRECTLY.

914
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:57,221
WE TRY TO INTERPRET HIS WISHES
AS BEST WE CAN.

915
00:50:57,221 --> 00:51:00,265
HOW HAVE YOU INTERPRETED
THE CARETAKER'S REASON

916
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,517
FOR SENDING US HERE?

917
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:03,435
WE BELIEVE HE
SEPARATED YOU

918
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:06,146
FROM YOUR OWN SPECIES
FOR THEIR PROTECTION.

919
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,439
THEIR PROTECTION?

920
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:09,901
FROM YOUR ILLNESS.

921
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:12,904
PERHAPS HE IS TRYING
TO PREVENT A PLAGUE.

922
00:51:12,904 --> 00:51:15,656
WE WEREN'T SICK UNTIL
WE MET YOUR CARETAKER.

923
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:18,826
FROM TIME TO TIME,
HE ASKS US TO CARE FOR PEOPLE

924
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:20,118
WITH THIS DISEASE.

925
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,829
IT'S THE LEAST WE CAN DO.

926
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:24,122
THERE HAVE BEEN OTHERS--
LIKE US?

927
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:26,082
YES.

928
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:28,168
WHERE ARE THEY?

929
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:32,631
YOUR CONDITION IS SERIOUS.

930
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:35,718
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
HOW TO TREAT IT.

931
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:38,888
I'M AFRAID THE OTHERS
DID NOT RECOVER.

932
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:04,705
(<i> Neelix singing</i> )

933
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,808
(<i> hits shrill note</i> )

934
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,776
SIR...

935
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:37,613
Neelix:
AH, HELLO, MR. VULCAN.
COME IN. COME IN.

936
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:39,907
PLEASE, I CAN
HARDLY SEE YOU.

937
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:43,201
I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR YOUR HOSPITALITY.

938
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:45,704
I MUST ADMIT,
I HAVEN'T HAD ACCESS

939
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:48,833
TO A FOOD REPLOR...
UH, REPLICATOR BEFORE.

940
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:52,252
I'D NEVER HAVE GUESSED.

941
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:54,713
AND TO IMMERSE MYSELF
IN WATER...

942
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:57,173
OH, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT JOY THIS IS?

943
00:52:57,173 --> 00:52:58,968
(<i> spits and coughs</i> )

944
00:52:58,968 --> 00:53:02,554
NO ONE AROUND HERE
WASTES WATER IN THIS MANNER.

945
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:04,056
A GOOD SAND SCRUB--

946
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:07,018
THAT'S THE BEST
THAT WE CAN HOPE FOR.

947
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:08,477
(<i> laughing</i> )

948
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:10,479
I'M PLEASED
YOU'RE ENJOYING YOURSELF,

949
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:11,856
BUT WE'RE IN ORBIT
OF THE FIFTH PLANET.

950
00:53:11,856 --> 00:53:13,732
WE NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE.

951
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:18,154
OH, UH, COULD YOU HAND
ME THE, UH... TOWEL?

952
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:25,911
IF YOU WILL SCAN
THE LARGE SOUTHERN CONTINENT

953
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,789
YOU'LL FIND A RANGE
OF EXTINCT VOLCANOES.

954
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:30,833
FOLLOW THE FOOTHILLS NORTH

955
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:33,127
UNTIL YOU DISCOVER
A DRY RIVER BED.

956
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:35,337
YOU'LL FIND
AN ENCAMPMENT THERE.

957
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:36,672
DO YOU BELIEVE

958
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:39,091
OUR PEOPLE MIGHT BE
AT THIS LOCATION?

959
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:41,844
IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE...
MAYBE...

960
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:44,805
PERHAPS NOT,
BUT WE'LL FIND THEM.

961
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:49,560
WE'LL NEED SEVERAL CONTAINERS
OF WATER TO BRING FOR BARTER.

962
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:54,148
DO THESE, UH, REPLICATORS
MAKE CLOTHING, AS WELL?

963
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:55,774
YES.

964
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:58,234
WILL IT MAKE ME
A UNIFORM LIKE YOURS?

965
00:53:58,234 --> 00:53:59,695
NO...

966
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:02,156
IT MOST CERTAINLY
WILL NOT.

967
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:04,909
HMM...

968
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:10,330
(<i> wind blowing</i> )

969
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:26,013
(<i> aliens yelling</i> ):
<i>DYE-BOH! DYE-BOH!</i>

970
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:32,019
Paris:
WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT
TO LIVE IN A PLACE

971
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:33,520
LIKE THIS?

972
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,899
THE RICH CORMALINE DEPOSITS
ARE VERY MUCH IN DEMAND.

973
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:39,151
THE OCAMPA USE
IT FOR BARTER?

974
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:41,486
NOT THE OCAMPA,
THE KAZON-OGLA.

975
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:44,322
THE KAZON-OGLA?
WHO ARE THE KAZON-OGLA?

976
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:45,866
THEY ARE.

977
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:48,452
KAZON SECTS CONTROL THIS
PART OF THE QUADRANT.

978
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:51,122
SOME HAVE FOOD,
SOME HAVE ORE,
SOME HAVE WATER.

979
00:54:51,122 --> 00:54:53,999
THEY ALL TRADE,
AND KILL EACH OTHER FOR IT.

980
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:56,252
YOU SAID THE OCAMPA
HAD OUR PEOPLE.

981
00:54:56,252 --> 00:54:58,712
MY FRIENDS!
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN!

982
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:02,133
WAIT! YES, IT'S<i> WONDERFUL</i>
<i>TO BE BACK WITH YOU!</i>

983
00:55:02,133 --> 00:55:06,845
I MUST SPEAK WITH YOUR MAJE,
THE EVER WISE JABIN.

984
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,806
(<i> grunting</i> )

985
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:11,100
IT'S VERY AMUSING.

986
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,684
VERY AMUSING.

987
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:14,519
I... I ENJOY A JOKE

988
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:16,730
AS MUCH AS THE NEXT MAN.

989
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:20,692
JABIN! MY OLD FRIEND!

990
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:25,697
W-WATER...
WATER, JABIN.

991
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:29,325
I HAVE WATER... TO REPLACE
ALL THAT I BORROWED.

992
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:31,036
SHOW THEM,
MR. PARIS.

993
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,746
THEIR SHIP
HAS TECHNOLOGY

994
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,166
THAT MAKES WATER
OUT OF THIN AIR!

995
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:45,425
YOU HAVE MORE?

996
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:49,180
JANEWAY TO<i> VOYAGER.</i> ENERGIZE.

997
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:04,153
THERE'S MORE WHERE THAT
CAME FROM IF YOU CAN HELP US.

998
00:56:04,153 --> 00:56:08,115
HOW CAN WE HELP SOMEONE THAT CAN
CREATE WATER OUT OF THIN AIR?

999
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:10,326
THIS MAN LED US HERE

1000
00:56:10,326 --> 00:56:13,287
SUGGESTING WE MIGHT FIND
A PEOPLE CALLED THE OCAMPA.

1001
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:15,164
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE THEY ARE?

1002
00:56:15,164 --> 00:56:17,208
OCAMPA?

1003
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:19,918
SHE IS OCAMPA.

1004
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:22,213
WHY WOULD YOU BE
INTERESTED IN SUCH

1005
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:23,379
WORTHLESS CREATURES?

1006
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:24,798
THEY LIVE ONLY
NINE YEARS.

1007
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:27,051
THEY MAKE
POOR SERVANTS.

1008
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:29,053
WE CAUGHT HER WHEN SHE WANDERED

1009
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:30,262
TO THE SURFACE.

1010
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:32,097
YOU MEAN
THEY LIVE UNDERGROUND?

1011
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:35,559
THE ENTITY IN SPACE THAT GIVES
THEM FOOD AND POWER GIVES THEM

1012
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:37,978
SOLE ACCESS TO THIS WORLD'S
ONLY WATER--

1013
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:39,938
TWO MILES BELOW
THE SURFACE.

1014
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,774
THIS SAME ENTITY
ABDUCTED TWO OF OUR PEOPLE.

1015
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,361
WE BELIEVE THEY MIGHT BE
WITH THE OCAMPA.

1016
00:56:45,361 --> 00:56:49,031
THERE'S NO WAY
TO GET TO THEM. WE TRIED.

1017
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:51,950
THE ENTITY ESTABLISHED
A SUBTERRANEAN BARRIER

1018
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,493
WE CANNOT PENETRATE.

1019
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,120
BUT SHE GOT OUT.

1020
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,540
OCCASIONALLY, SOME OF THEM DO
FIND THEIR WAY TO THE SURFACE.

1021
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,084
WE DON'T KNOW HOW.

1022
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:02,711
THE OCAMPA SEAL THE
TUNNELS AFTERWARDS.

1023
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:05,881
MAYBE SHE CAN HELP THESE
GOOD PEOPLE FIND A WAY DOWN.

1024
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:08,092
YOU'D BE WASTING YOUR TIME.

1025
00:57:08,092 --> 00:57:11,053
I'VE USED EVERY METHOD
OF PERSUASION I KNOW

1026
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:12,971
TO GET HER
TO HELP US.

1027
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,848
SHE WON'T!

1028
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:17,101
THEN SHE'S WORTHLESS TO YOU.

1029
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:20,812
LET US TRADE YOU WATER
FOR THIS SCRAWNY LITTLE THING.

1030
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:24,566
I'D BE MORE INTERESTED
IN ACQUIRING THIS TECHNOLOGY

1031
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:26,026
THAT ALLOWS YOU

1032
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:28,279
TO CREATE WATER
FROM THIN AIR.

1033
00:57:28,279 --> 00:57:30,155
THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT.

1034
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,282
IT'S INTEGRATED

1035
00:57:31,282 --> 00:57:33,325
INTO OUR
SHIP'S SYSTEMS.

1036
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:35,452
TELL THEM TO DROP
THEIR WEAPONS.

1037
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:39,248
DROP THEM, MY FRIENDS,
OR HE DIES IN AN INSTANT.

1038
00:57:39,248 --> 00:57:40,958
DO IT!

1039
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:43,710
DO IT!

1040
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,177
Neelix:
STEP ASIDE.

1041
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,350
COME ON!

1042
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,562
I STRONGLY SUGGEST
YOU GET US OUT OF HERE.

1043
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:04,022
SIX TO BEAM UP.

1044
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:19,204
MY DEAREST, DIDN'T I
PROMISE I'D SAVE YOU?

1045
00:58:34,345 --> 00:58:35,846
Kim:
LOOK. I'M SURE CAPTAIN JANEWAY

1046
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:38,265
IS DOING EVERYTHING
SHE CAN TO FIND US.

1047
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:42,519
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
ANY OF THEM ARE STILL ALIVE?

1048
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,855
SHOULD I CALL
FOR SOME HELP?

1049
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:46,564
NO.

1050
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:04,791
ARE YOU IN PAIN?

1051
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,084
ARE YOU WATCHING US?

1052
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,919
I THOUGHT WE WEREN'T PRISONERS.

1053
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,171
I WASN'T WATCHING YOU.

1054
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:11,548
I WAS COMING
TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING.

1055
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:14,926
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'LL HELP.
IT'S A MEDICINE.

1056
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,553
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE
BROKEN FROM TRADITION

1057
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:17,846
AND LEFT THE CITY.

1058
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:19,973
THE COLONY
GROWS FRUITS AND VEGETABLES.

1059
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,642
THEY DISCOVERED
THAT THE MOSS THAT GROWS

1060
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:25,437
ON CERTAIN FRUIT TREES
HAS HEALING PROPERTIES.

1061
00:59:25,437 --> 00:59:27,981
I'M SORRY FOR WHAT
HAS HAPPENED TO YOU.

1062
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,441
WE APPRECIATE THIS

1063
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:31,443
BUT THE ONLY WAY
WE'LL SURVIVE

1064
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:34,612
IS IF WE GET TO THE SURFACE
AND FIND OUR OWN PEOPLE.

1065
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:38,033
THE ELDERS WOULD SAY THAT'S
AGAINST THE CARETAKER'S WISHES.

1066
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:39,410
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

1067
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:42,329
THE CARETAKER'S
BEEN BEHAVING STRANGELY

1068
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:44,540
FOR THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS--

1069
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:47,543
ABDUCTING PEOPLE,
INCREASING THE POWER SUPPLY.

1070
00:59:47,543 --> 00:59:48,835
POWER SUPPLY?

1071
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:51,422
HE'S TRIPLED THE ENERGY
HE SENDS US.

1072
00:59:51,422 --> 00:59:54,466
WE HAVE ENOUGH TO RUN
THE CITY FOR FIVE YEARS.

1073
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:56,301
NOBODY KNOWS WHY?

1074
00:59:56,301 --> 01:00:01,390
WHEN WE ASK, WE'RE TOLD TO TRUST
THE CARETAKER'S DECISIONS.

1075
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:03,850
ONE PERSON DID GET
TO THE SURFACE.

1076
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,769
WE NEVER SAW HER AGAIN.

1077
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:07,604
HOW?

1078
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:10,357
THE TUNNELS THAT
BROUGHT US HERE STILL EXIST.

1079
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:12,150
BREACHES IN SECURITY BARRIER

1080
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:14,570
HAVE APPEARED,
LARGE ENOUGH
TO GET THROUGH

1081
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:16,071
BUT IT STILL
REQUIRES DIGGING

1082
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:18,490
THROUGH METERS OF
ROCK TO GET OUT.

1083
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:20,742
CAN YOU GET US TOOLS
TO DIG WITH?

1084
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:24,580
IT WOULD TAKE DAYS, MAYBE
EVEN WEEKS TO BREAK THROUGH.

1085
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:26,790
YOU HAVE TO REST.

1086
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:28,625
CONSERVE YOUR STRENGTH.

1087
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,961
PLEASE... IT'S OUR ONLY CHANCE.

1088
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:44,141
Tuvok:
IF YOU HAD TOLD US
WHAT YOU HAD PLANNED,

1089
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:46,643
WE MIGHT HAVE ANTICIPATED
YOUR IRRATIONAL BEHAVIOR.

1090
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:50,105
IRRATIONAL? WE GOT OUT
OF THERE, DIDN'T WE?

1091
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:52,232
EXCUSE ME.
DON'T BLAME NEELIX.

1092
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:53,942
THIS IS A SICK BAY

1093
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:56,528
NOT A CONFERENCE ROOM.

1094
01:00:56,528 --> 01:01:00,407
EVERYONE, EXCEPT MY PATIENT,
IS TO LEAVE IMMEDIATELY.

1095
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:04,202
COMPUTER, END MEDICAL
HOLOGRAPHIC PROGRAM.

1096
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:06,704
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
GONE TO THE SURFACE.

1097
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:08,706
I'M TOO CURIOUS.

1098
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:10,875
I'M TOLD IT'S
MY WORST FAILING.

1099
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:12,794
NO. NO. IT'S
A WONDERFUL QUALITY--

1100
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:14,296
YOU'RE MOST ENDEARING.

1101
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:17,174
WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO TAKE US UNDERGROUND

1102
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:19,384
TO LOOK FOR OUR MISSING CREW?

1103
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:21,761
JABIN WAS RIGHT.
THERE'S NO WAY DOWN.

1104
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:24,181
THE TUNNEL I CAME OUT
HAS BEEN SEALED.

1105
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:25,641
WE DON'T NEED A TUNNEL.

1106
01:01:25,641 --> 01:01:27,767
WE HAVE THE ABILITY
TO TRANSPORT THERE DIRECTLY.

1107
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:31,688
CAPTAIN, OUR SENSORS DID NOT
PICK UP ANY INDICATION

1108
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,482
OF AN UNDERGROUND
CIVILIZATION.

1109
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:35,484
THE SUBTERRANEAN BARRIER
JABIN DESCRIBED

1110
01:01:35,484 --> 01:01:36,860
MAY BE RESPONSIBLE.

1111
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:39,404
IT MIGHT ALSO BLOCK
OUR TRANSPORTER.

1112
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:40,989
THERE ARE BREACHES

1113
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:43,116
IN THE SECURITY
BARRIER WHERE

1114
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,409
IT'S BEGUN TO DECAY.

1115
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:45,702
THAT'S HOW I GOT OUT.

1116
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,413
HAVE THE TRANSPORTER ROOM
BEGIN A SWEEP

1117
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:51,958
FOR ANY BREACHES WE MIGHT
BE ABLE TO BEAM THROUGH.

1118
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:54,002
KES CAN TELL YOU
WHERE TO GO

1119
01:01:54,002 --> 01:01:55,671
BUT NOW THAT SHE'S FREE

1120
01:01:55,671 --> 01:01:57,964
WE'RE LEAVING
THIS SYSTEM TOGETHER.

1121
01:01:57,964 --> 01:01:59,257
NEELIX,

1122
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,717
THESE PEOPLE RESCUED ME.

1123
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,594
I RESCUED YOU.

1124
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:04,513
WITH THEIR HELP.

1125
01:02:04,513 --> 01:02:06,431
IT WOULD BE WRONG

1126
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:09,309
NOT TO HELP THEM NOW.

1127
01:02:24,408 --> 01:02:26,577
CAPTAIN, THE PULSES FROM THE
ARRAY CONTINUE TO ACCELERATE.

1128
01:02:26,577 --> 01:02:27,911
THE INTERVALS BETWEEN THEM

1129
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:30,455
HAVE DECREASED
ANOTHER .8 SECONDS.

1130
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:43,176
KES.

1131
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:44,469
HELLO, DAGGIN.

1132
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:46,680
WE THOUGHT WE'D NEVER
SEE YOU AGAIN.

1133
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,181
HOW DID YOU GET BACK?

1134
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:49,849
THESE PEOPLE RESCUED ME.

1135
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:52,394
I'M TRYING TO HELP THEM
FIND TWO OF THEIR CREW.

1136
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:55,439
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE
THE ALIENS ARE KEPT-- THE ONES

1137
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:57,148
THE CARETAKER
SENDS HERE?

1138
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:58,400
THE CENTRAL CLINIC.

1139
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,026
CAN YOU TAKE US THERE?

1140
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:02,320
<i>NO, SHE CANNOT.</i>

1141
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,197
THEY CAN'T SPEAK
TELEPATHICALLY.

1142
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:06,408
PLEASE TALK ALOUD.

1143
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:09,286
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO BE RUDE

1144
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:11,079
BUT YOU SHOULD NOT BE HERE.

1145
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:13,873
WE'LL BE GLAD TO LEAVE
ONCE WE FIND OUR CREWMEN.

1146
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:15,792
THAT WON'T BE POSSIBLE.
WE CANNOT INTERFERE

1147
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,544
WITH THE CARETAKER'S
WISHES.

1148
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:19,504
MAYBE YOU CAN'T,
BUT WE CAN.

1149
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:21,965
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1150
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:24,801
THAT'S RIGHT. THEY DON'T
UNDERSTAND THAT THE OCAMPA

1151
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,887
HAVE BEEN DEPENDENT ON
THE CARETAKER FOR SO LONG

1152
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:30,390
WE CAN'T EVEN THINK
FOR OURSELVES ANYMORE.

1153
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:33,017
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND
WE WERE ONCE A PEOPLE

1154
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:35,729
WHO HAD FULL COMMAND
OF OUR MINDS' ABILITIES.

1155
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:38,690
THE STORIES OF OUR ANCESTORS
COGNITIVE ABILITIES

1156
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:40,024
ARE APOCRYPHAL--

1157
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:42,402
AT THE VERY LEAST
EXAGGERATED.

1158
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:45,447
WE LOST THOSE ABILITIES
BECAUSE WE STOPPED USING THEM.

1159
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:47,616
WE SHOULD NOT DWELL
ON WHAT'S BEEN LOST

1160
01:03:47,616 --> 01:03:49,618
BUT ON ALL THAT'S BEEN GAINED.

1161
01:03:49,618 --> 01:03:51,745
WE'VE GAINED A TALENT
FOR DEPENDENCE

1162
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:53,955
FOR SIMPLY TAKING
WHAT WE'RE GIVEN.

1163
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:56,291
I'M HELPING THEM WHETHER
YOU LIKE IT OR NOT

1164
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:59,169
AND I THINK MY FRIENDS
WILL JOIN ME.

1165
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:06,343
YOU DEFIED THE CARETAKER
BY GOING TO THE SURFACE, KES.

1166
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:09,095
LEARN FROM THE EXPERIENCE.

1167
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:11,848
FOLLOW THE PATH
HE HAS SET FOR US.

1168
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:15,727
I'VE LEARNED VERY WELL, TOSCAT.
I SAW THE SUNLIGHT.

1169
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:17,354
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT OUR CARETAKER

1170
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:19,897
WOULD FORBID US
TO OPEN OUR EYES

1171
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:21,525
AND SEE THE SKY.

1172
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:24,361
COME WITH ME.
WE'LL FIND
YOUR PEOPLE.

1173
01:04:45,923 --> 01:04:47,217
COME ON.

1174
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,399
(<i> metallic clanging</i> )

1175
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:05,736
DON'T LET IT BEAT YOU,
STARFLEET. COME ON.

1176
01:05:05,736 --> 01:05:07,529
I'M SORRY.

1177
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:13,535
ALL RIGHT.

1178
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:18,122
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL REST A MINUTE.

1179
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:21,042
MAYBE I'D DO BETTER
IF I HAD KLINGON BLOOD IN ME.

1180
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:25,338
TRUST ME. IT'S MORE TROUBLE
THAN IT'S WORTH.

1181
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:29,175
YOU KNOW, I SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE
GETTING READY FOR STARFLEET

1182
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:33,012
AND ON MY VERY FIRST MISSION

1183
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:35,056
I'M GOING TO DIE.

1184
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:38,894
WE'RE NOT FINISHED YET.

1185
01:05:38,894 --> 01:05:40,520
I KNOW A FEW THINGS

1186
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,397
THAT OLD SNEEZY DIDN'T TEACH
IN HIS SURVIVAL COURSE.

1187
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:44,441
SNEEZY?

1188
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:46,234
COMMANDER ZAKARIAN.

1189
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:47,611
REMEMBER?

1190
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:50,405
HE MUST HAVE BEEN
ALLERGIC TO EVERYTHING.

1191
01:05:50,405 --> 01:05:52,323
YOU WENT TO THE ACADEMY.

1192
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:54,826
I ACTUALLY MADE IT
INTO THE SECOND YEAR

1193
01:05:54,826 --> 01:05:58,747
BEFORE WE MUTUALLY AGREED
THAT IT WASN'T THE PLACE FOR ME.

1194
01:05:58,747 --> 01:06:00,039
YOU KNOW,

1195
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:02,417
I NEVER REALLY LIKED ZAKARIAN.

1196
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:04,544
(<i> electronic pulses</i> )

1197
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:06,170
SHH. LISTEN.

1198
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:08,590
THEY'RE GETTING
FASTER.

1199
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:19,476
(<i> electronic pulses become</i>
<i>louder and louder</i> )

1200
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:21,478
(<i> pulses stop</i> )

1201
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:23,187
AWAY TEAM TO<i> VOYAGER.</i>

1202
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:25,148
Rollins:
<i>Voyager</i> here.

1203
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:27,108
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE ARRAY?

1204
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:29,694
IT'S NO LONGER
SENDING OUT PULSES, CAPTAIN

1205
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:32,989
AND IT APPEARS TO BE
REALIGNING ITS POSITION.

1206
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,365
Keep me informed. Janeway out.

1207
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:40,705
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN
AT THE CLINIC FOR HOURS.

1208
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:42,707
WE CAN SEARCH THE CITY.
ASK IF ANYONE'S SEEN THEM.

1209
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:44,417
IF THEY WERE TRYING
TO GET TO THE SURFACE,

1210
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:47,003
HOW WOULD THEY GO?
PROBABLY THE SAME WAY I DID--

1211
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,296
UP ONE OF THE ANCIENT TUNNELS.

1212
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:51,215
MR. PARIS,
YOU AND NEELIX GO WITH HER

1213
01:06:51,215 --> 01:06:52,467
AND START CHECKING THEM OUT.

1214
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:55,762
WE NEED TO TALK
TO EVERY DOCTOR AND NURSE

1215
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:58,055
SEE WHAT THEY CAN TELL US
ABOUT TORRES AND KIM.

1216
01:06:58,055 --> 01:07:00,016
Rollins:
<i>Voyager</i> to Janeway.

1217
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,392
GO AHEAD.

1218
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:04,145
CAPTAIN, THE ARRAY IS FIRING
SOME KIND OF WEAPON

1219
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:06,356
AT THE SURFACE.

1220
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,692
IT SEEMS TO BE TRYING TO SEAL
THE ENERGY CONDUITS.

1221
01:07:08,692 --> 01:07:11,528
Understood. Keep a channel open.

1222
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:13,655
IF THE ARRAY IS THE OCAMPA'S
SOLE SOURCE OF ENERGY,

1223
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:15,532
WHY WOULD THE CARETAKER
SEAL THE CONDUITS?

1224
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:16,825
HE WOULD SEAL THEM

1225
01:07:16,825 --> 01:07:18,117
IF HE NO LONGER
INTENDED TO USE THEM

1226
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:19,911
TO PROTECT THE OCAMPA
FROM THEIR ENEMIES.

1227
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:21,788
CAPTAIN, THERE IS NOW
ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO FORM

1228
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:23,247
A REASONABLE HYPOTHESIS.

1229
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:24,749
I BELIEVE THAT
THE CARETAKER IS DYING.

1230
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:26,334
EXPLAIN.

1231
01:07:26,334 --> 01:07:30,296
FIRST, HE INCREASES THE ENERGY
SUPPLY TO PROVIDE A SURPLUS

1232
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:33,257
TO LAST FIVE YEARS,
THEN SEALS THE CONDUITS.

1233
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:34,718
THE LOGICAL CONCLUSION IS

1234
01:07:34,718 --> 01:07:37,220
HE NO LONGER INTENDS
TO CONTINUE AS CARETAKER.

1235
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:39,931
THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE'S DYING.
HE COULD BE LEAVING.

1236
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:43,852
NOT AFTER A MILLENNIUM
OF PROVIDING FOR THESE PEOPLE.

1237
01:07:43,852 --> 01:07:46,897
I BELIEVE THAT THE CARETAKER
OWES SOMETHING TO THE OCAMPA.

1238
01:07:46,897 --> 01:07:49,232
I BELIEVE THE DEBT THAT
CAN NEVER BE REPAID

1239
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:51,526
IS VERY LIKELY
A DEBT TO THEM.

1240
01:07:51,526 --> 01:07:53,945
IN ADDITION, THERE WERE
HIS FREQUENT REFERENCES

1241
01:07:53,945 --> 01:07:55,405
TO RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

1242
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:58,366
I THINK HE KNEW
HIS DEATH WAS IMMINENT.

1243
01:07:58,366 --> 01:08:02,370
IF HE DIES, HOW THE HELL
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GET HOME?

1244
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:11,295
THEY'RE IN THIS ONE.

1245
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:13,172
HARRY?

1246
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:16,927
PARIS TO JANEWAY.

1247
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:18,219
Go ahead.

1248
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:19,804
THEY'RE IN ONE
OF THE TUNNELS, CAPTAIN.

1249
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:21,932
I CAN'T SEE THEM,
BUT THEY'RE UP THERE.

1250
01:08:21,932 --> 01:08:23,850
WE'RE GOING AFTER THEM.

1251
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:26,603
CALL FOR TRANSPORT
WHEN YOU HAVE THEM.

1252
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:28,187
WE'LL MEET YOU ON THE SHIP.

1253
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:30,106
JANEWAY TO<i> VOYAGER.</i>
Rollins:<i> Voyager</i> here.

1254
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,357
THREE TO BEAM UP.

1255
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:33,026
Rollins:
Stand by.

1256
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:36,613
CAPTAIN,
I CAN'T GET A LOCK ON YOU.

1257
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:40,116
The Array's weapon fire has
irradiated the planet's crust.

1258
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,159
THE TRANSPORT SENSORS
CAN'T FIND THE BREACHES

1259
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:43,620
IN THE SECURITY BARRIER.

1260
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:49,084
COME ON. THERE'S ONLY ONE
OTHER WAY OUT OF HERE.

1261
01:08:49,084 --> 01:08:50,501
Janeway to Paris.

1262
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:51,836
GO AHEAD.

1263
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:53,880
The transporters aren't working.

1264
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,840
You'll have to find
a breach in the security barrier

1265
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,968
when you get to the top.

1266
01:08:57,968 --> 01:08:59,928
UNDERSTOOD.

1267
01:08:59,928 --> 01:09:01,387
We're a few minutes behind you.

1268
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:02,973
Janeway out.

1269
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:07,226
I SEE THEM.

1270
01:09:18,113 --> 01:09:20,364
IT TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH.

1271
01:09:20,364 --> 01:09:23,701
HOW COULD I LET DOWN
THE ONLY FRIEND I GOT?

1272
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:27,330
FRIEND? WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I'M YOUR FRIEND?

1273
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:32,418
PARIS TO JANEWAY.
WE FOUND THEM, CAPTAIN.

1274
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:33,628
DON'T WAIT FOR US.

1275
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:35,755
GET THEM TO SAFETY.

1276
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:42,846
DON'T WORRY. I KNOW WHERE WE CAN
GET THROUGH THE BARRIER.

1277
01:09:49,644 --> 01:09:52,856
WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T TOUCH IT.

1278
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:55,483
WE'VE BEEN TOLD
IT'LL BURN YOUR SKIN OFF.

1279
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:12,876
Janeway:
THEY'RE NOT FAR AHEAD OF US.
KEEP GOING.

1280
01:10:30,267 --> 01:10:32,979
I THINK WE'VE REACHED
THE TOP.

1281
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:35,732
NEELIX, GET OUT
YOUR PHASER.

1282
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:45,969
Paris:
<i>VOYAGER,</i> CAN YOU GET
A LOCK ON US NOW?

1283
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:48,846
Affirmative, but I'm reading
only five signals.

1284
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:50,514
THE OTHERS ARE...

1285
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:51,975
GET DOWN!

1286
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:04,946
PARIS TO JANEWAY.

1287
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:06,614
CHAKOTAY, TUVOK,

1288
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:08,032
DO YOU READ?

1289
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:11,202
<i>VOYAGER,</i> PREPARE

1290
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:13,370

01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:14,956
YOU'RE NOT THINKING

1292
01:12:14,956 --> 01:12:16,499
OF GOING BACK THERE.

1293
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:20,795
WELL...

1294
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:23,380
THE FOOL NEEDS COMPANY.

1295
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:24,924
TAKE CARE OF THEM, DEAREST.

1296
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:26,301
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

1297
01:12:26,301 --> 01:12:28,719
<i>VOYAGER,</i> MAKE THAT
THREE TO BEAM UP.

1298
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:30,847
LOCK IN
ON THE OTHER COMBADGE

1299
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:32,682
AND ENERGIZE.

1300
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:41,482
(<i> screams</i> )

1301
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:43,609
MY LEG IS BROKEN.

1302
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:45,486
I CAN'T MOVE.

1303
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:47,113
HOLD ON.

1304
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:50,491
NEELIX, HELP ME
WITH TUVOK.

1305
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:53,410
I'LL GET CHAKOTAY.

1306
01:12:58,208 --> 01:12:59,917
(<i> groaning</i> )

1307
01:13:08,259 --> 01:13:10,261
GET OUT
OF HERE, PARIS

1308
01:13:10,261 --> 01:13:12,263
BEFORE THE WHOLE THING
COMES DOWN.

1309
01:13:12,263 --> 01:13:14,015
I INTEND TO...

1310
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:16,309
AS SOON AS I GET YOU UP.

1311
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:18,269
THOSE STAIRS WILL COLLAPSE.

1312
01:13:18,269 --> 01:13:19,645
WE'LL BOTH DIE.

1313
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:21,438
YEAH?

1314
01:13:21,438 --> 01:13:23,191
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND

1315
01:13:23,191 --> 01:13:26,610
IF I SAVE YOUR BUTT,
YOUR LIFE BELONGS TO ME.

1316
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:37,580
ISN'T THAT SOME KIND
OF INDIAN CUSTOM?

1317
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:40,708
WRONG TRIBE.

1318
01:13:43,002 --> 01:13:45,838
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

1319
01:13:49,384 --> 01:13:51,468
YOU'D RATHER DIE

1320
01:13:51,468 --> 01:13:54,055
THEN LET ME BE THE ONE
TO RESCUE YOU?

1321
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:55,723
FINE. BE A FOOL.

1322
01:13:55,723 --> 01:13:58,809
IF I HAVE TO DIE,
AT LEAST I'LL HAVE THE PLEASURE

1323
01:13:58,809 --> 01:14:02,355
OF WATCHING YOU GO WITH ME.

1324
01:14:06,401 --> 01:14:08,236
Paris:
ISN'T THERE SOME INDIAN TRICK

1325
01:14:08,236 --> 01:14:11,155
WHERE YOU CAN TURN
YOURSELF INTO A BIRD

1326
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:13,157
AND FLY US OUT OF HERE?

1327
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:16,369
YOU'RE TOO HEAVY.

1328
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:38,474
Rollins:
Bridge to Janeway.

1329
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,184
GO AHEAD.

1330
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:42,228
Two Kazon ships
are approaching the Array.

1331
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:43,854
SET A COURSE. I'M ON MY WAY.

1332
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:46,023
WE'VE GOT TO GET BACK
TO OUR SHIP.

1333
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:48,192
I STRONGLY ADVISE
YOU TO REST.

1334
01:14:48,192 --> 01:14:51,528
I WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE CONSEQUENCES.

1335
01:14:51,528 --> 01:14:53,739
IS THE CREW ALWAYS
THIS DIFFICULT?

1336
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,241
I DON'T KNOW, DOC.

1337
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:57,160
IT'S MY FIRST MISSION.

1338
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,869
(<i> deep sigh</i> )

1339
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:02,415
DOESN'T ANYONE KNOW HOW
TO TURN OFF THE PROGRAM

1340
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:03,958
WHEN THEY LEAVE?

1341
01:15:05,126 --> 01:15:07,795
BRING THE WEAPONS
SYSTEMS ON-LINE.

1342
01:15:07,795 --> 01:15:11,174
Tuvok:
POWERING UP PHASER BANKS
AND PHOTON SYSTEMS.

1343
01:15:11,174 --> 01:15:12,800
RED ALERT.

1344
01:15:29,817 --> 01:15:31,610
Tuvok:
THE LEAD KAZON SHIP

1345
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:32,903
IS HAILING US, CAPTAIN.

1346
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:34,113
ON SCREEN.

Have you come to investigate

1348
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:38,242
the entity's
strange behavior too?

1349
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:40,411
ALL WE CARE ABOUT
IS GETTING HOME.

1350
01:15:40,411 --> 01:15:42,372
WE'RE TRANSPORTING
TO THE ARRAY

1351
01:15:42,372 --> 01:15:43,914
TO TRY TO ARRANGE IT.

1352
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:45,749
I'm afraid I cannot permit that.

1353
01:15:45,749 --> 01:15:48,044
WE HAVE NO DISPUTE
WITH YOU.

1354
01:15:48,044 --> 01:15:51,381
I have a dispute with anyone
who would challenge us.

1355
01:15:51,381 --> 01:15:54,591
WE HAVE NO INTENTION
OF CHALLENGING YOU.

1356
01:15:54,591 --> 01:15:56,635
I have no intention
of letting anyone

1357
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:59,555
with your technological
knowledge board the Array.

1358
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:01,432
CAN WE DISCUSS THIS
LIKE CIVILIZED...?

1359
01:16:01,432 --> 01:16:03,934
Tuvok:
THEY'RE POWERING UP
THEIR WEAPONS.

1360
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:05,353
I GUESS WE CAN'T.

1361
01:16:06,854 --> 01:16:10,566
SHIELDS ARE HOLDING.

1362
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:12,151
FIRE PHASERS.

DELTA FOUR.

1364
01:16:28,418 --> 01:16:29,877
Janeway to Chakotay.

1365
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:32,088
Tuvok and I
are beaming to the Array.

1366
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:33,839
Can you hold off the Kazon?

1367
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:35,341
I THINK SO, CAPTAIN.

1368
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:37,468
GOOD.

1369
01:16:37,468 --> 01:16:41,055
MR. PARIS,
TAKE THE CONN.

1370
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:42,723
YES, MA'AM.

MAINTAIN TRANSPORTER LOCKS,

AYE, CAPTAIN.

1373
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:01,284
THE DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM

1374
01:17:01,284 --> 01:17:02,618
IS BEHIND THIS
WALL, CAPTAIN.

1375
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:04,537
(<i> banjo strumming</i> )

1376
01:17:08,416 --> 01:17:11,085

01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:34,858
WELL... YOU'RE NOTHING
IF NOT PERSISTENT.

1379
01:17:34,858 --> 01:17:38,028
WE NEED YOU TO SEND US BACK
WHERE WE CAME FROM.

1380
01:17:38,028 --> 01:17:41,240
OH... THAT ISN'T POSSIBLE.

1381
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:45,911
I BARELY HAVE ENOUGH STRENGTH
TO COMPLETE MY WORK.

1382
01:17:48,038 --> 01:17:51,167
YOU'RE SEALING THE CONDUITS
BEFORE YOU DIE.

1383
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:55,921
IF I DON'T, THE KAZON
WILL STEAL THE WATER.

1384
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:57,965
BUT IN A FEW YEARS

1385
01:17:57,965 --> 01:18:01,010
WHEN THE OCAMPA'S
ENERGY RUNS OUT

1386
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,845
IT WON'T MATTER.

1387
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:05,348
THEY'LL BE FORCED
TO COME TO THE SURFACE

1388
01:18:05,348 --> 01:18:07,642
AND THEY WON'T BE ABLE
TO SURVIVE.

1389
01:18:07,642 --> 01:18:11,020
SOMETHING YOU DID TURNED
THEIR PLANET INTO A DESERT

DIDN'T IT?

1391
01:18:12,355 --> 01:18:13,648
THAT WAS THE DEBT

1392
01:18:13,648 --> 01:18:15,691
THAT COULD NEVER
BE REPAID.

1393
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:20,696
WELL, WE'RE EXPLORERS
FROM ANOTHER GALAXY

1394
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:23,866
BUT WE HAD NO IDEA
THAT OUR TECHNOLOGY

1395
01:18:23,866 --> 01:18:27,703
WOULD BE SO DESTRUCTIVE
TO THEIR ATMOSPHERE.

1396
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,246
TWO OF US WERE CHOSEN

1397
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:32,249
TO STAY BEHIND
AND CARE FOR THEM.

1398
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:34,627
THERE'S ANOTHER LIKE YOU HERE?

1399
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:36,420
(<i> chuckles</i> )

1400
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:38,088
NOT ANYMORE.

1401
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:39,715
NO, NO. SHE...

1402
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:43,302
SHE WENT OFF TO LOOK
FOR MORE INTERESTING PLACES.

1403
01:18:43,302 --> 01:18:45,304
WHY WERE YOU BRINGING SHIPS HERE

1404
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:47,515
INFECTING PEOPLE
WITH A FATAL ILLNESS?

1405
01:18:47,515 --> 01:18:49,183
OH, THEY...

1406
01:18:49,183 --> 01:18:52,144
THEY DIDN'T DIE OF AN ILLNESS.

1407
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:57,900
THEY DIED BECAUSE
THEY WERE INCOMPATIBLE.

1408
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,777
"INCOMPATIBLE"?

1409
01:19:00,777 --> 01:19:03,573
I'VE BEEN SEARCHING THE GALAXY

1410
01:19:03,573 --> 01:19:08,035
FOR A COMPATIBLE
BIO-MOLECULAR PATTERN.

1411
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:09,579
IN SOME INDIVIDUALS

1412
01:19:09,579 --> 01:19:11,288
I FOUND
CELLULAR STRUCTURES

1413
01:19:11,288 --> 01:19:13,457
THAT WERE SIMILAR,
BUT...

1414
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:15,626
YOU'VE BEEN TRYING TO PROCREATE?

1415
01:19:15,626 --> 01:19:19,129
I NEEDED SOMEONE TO REPLACE ME

1416
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:21,924
SOMEONE WHO'D UNDERSTAND

1417
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:26,803
THE ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY
OF CARING FOR THE OCAMPA.

1418
01:19:26,803 --> 01:19:29,724
ONLY MY OFFSPRING COULD DO THAT.

1419
01:19:35,646 --> 01:19:37,607
DID YOU EVER CONSIDER

1420
01:19:37,607 --> 01:19:41,193
ALLOWING THE OCAMPA
TO CARE FOR THEMSELVES?

1421
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:44,530
THEY'RE CHILDREN.

1422
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:46,490
CHILDREN HAVE TO GROW UP.

1423
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:47,950
WE'RE EXPLORERS TOO.

1424
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:50,578
MOST OF THE SPECIES
WE'VE ENCOUNTERED

1425
01:19:50,578 --> 01:19:52,996
HAVE OVERCOME ALL KINDS
OF ADVERSITY

1426
01:19:52,996 --> 01:19:54,498
WITHOUT A CARETAKER.

1427
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:57,376
IT'S THE CHALLENGE
OF SURVIVING ON THEIR OWN

1428
01:19:57,376 --> 01:19:59,044
THAT HELPS THEM TO EVOLVE.

1429
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:04,216
MAYBE YOUR CHILDREN
WILL DO BETTER THAN YOU THINK.

1430
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:07,219
Kim:
<i>Voyager</i> to Janeway.

1431
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:09,639
GO AHEAD.
We've got problems here.

1432
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:21,609
KAZON GOT SOME BACKUP.

1433
01:20:21,609 --> 01:20:23,026
We need more time.

1434
01:20:23,026 --> 01:20:25,237
CAN YOU HOLD THEM OFF
FOR ANOTHER FEW MINUTES?

1435
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:27,364
We'll do our best.

1436
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:31,160
THEIR WEAPONS ARRAY
HAS BEEN HIT.

1437
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,620
THEY'RE IN TROUBLE.

1438
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:36,540
NEITHER OF US HAS ENOUGH
FIREPOWER TO STOP THAT SHIP.

1439
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:38,584
I'M SETTING
A COLLISION COURSE,

1440
01:20:38,584 --> 01:20:40,795
BUT THE GUIDANCE
SYSTEM IS DISABLED.

1441
01:20:40,795 --> 01:20:43,005
I'LL HAVE TO PILOT
THE SHIP MANUALLY.

1442
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:45,215
GET THE CREW READY
TO BEAM TO<i> VOYAGER</i>

1443
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:47,092
AND DROP SHIELDS
FOR TRANSPORT.

1444
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:49,886
PARIS, MY CREW IS COMING OVER.

1445
01:20:49,886 --> 01:20:53,140
TELL ONE OF YOUR CRACKERJACK
STARFLEET TRANSPORTER CHIEFS

1446
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:54,642
TO KEEP A LOCK ON ME.

1447
01:20:54,642 --> 01:20:56,727
I'M GOING TO TRY AND TAKE
SOME HEAT OFF YOUR TAIL.

1448
01:20:56,727 --> 01:20:58,395
Acknowledged.

1449
01:20:58,395 --> 01:21:01,732
BUT DON'T THINK FOR A SECOND
THIS MAKES US EVEN, CHAKOTAY.

1450
01:21:01,732 --> 01:21:03,233
YOUR LIFE IS STILL MINE.

1451
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:05,319
Paris out.

1452
01:21:15,912 --> 01:21:18,749
I'M GETTING YOU OUT
OF THERE, CHAKOTAY.

1453
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:20,459
Chakotay:
Not yet!

1454
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:24,129
Paris:
YOU'RE BREAKING UP!

1455
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:25,673
Stand by to transport.

1456
01:21:25,673 --> 01:21:27,216
WAIT!

1457
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:35,766
NOW!

1458
01:21:44,107 --> 01:21:47,110
Paris:
Transporter Room Two,
do you have him?

1459
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:48,779
THEY'VE GOT ME.

1460
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:59,832
CAPTAIN, I CAN
ACCESS THE SYSTEM

1461
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:01,625
TO SEND US BACK
TO FEDERATION SPACE

1462
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:05,212
BUT IT WILL TAKE
SEVERAL HOURS TO ACTIVATE.

1463
01:22:05,212 --> 01:22:06,839
UNLESS YOU HELP US.

1464
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:09,299
OH, I WISH I COULD,

1465
01:22:09,299 --> 01:22:11,761
BUT I HAVE VERY
LITTLE TIME LEFT.

1466
01:22:11,761 --> 01:22:15,848
SO I HAVE INITIATED
A SELF-DESTRUCT PROGRAM.

1467
01:22:15,848 --> 01:22:17,140
IF YOU DESTROY THE ARRAY

1468
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:18,809
WE'LL HAVE NO WAY
TO GET HOME.

1469
01:22:18,809 --> 01:22:21,604
THE OCAMPA'S ENEMIES
CANNOT BE ALLOWED

1470
01:22:21,604 --> 01:22:23,980
TO CONTROL THIS
INSTALLATION.

1471
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:27,568
IN MINUTES, IT
WILL BE DESTROYED.

1472
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:29,278
YOU HAVE TO GO.

1473
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:31,280
GO NOW!

1474
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:58,098
Tuvok:
THE CARETAKER.

1475
01:23:01,017 --> 01:23:02,519
<i>VOYAGER,</i> REPORT.

1476
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:04,187
Paris:
A Kazon vessel

1477
01:23:04,187 --> 01:23:06,899
JUST COLLIDED WITH THE ARRAY,
CAPTAIN.

1478
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:08,400
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

1479
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,693
Affirmative.

1480
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:12,362
STAND BY.

1481
01:23:12,362 --> 01:23:15,616
(<i> voice faltering</i> ):
The termination program

1482
01:23:15,616 --> 01:23:19,286
has been damaged.

1483
01:23:19,286 --> 01:23:22,539
The Kazon must not

1484
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:28,044
gain control
of this installation.

1485
01:23:50,818 --> 01:23:53,195
SHALL I ACTIVATE THE PROGRAM
TO GET US BACK?

1486
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:58,116
AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THE OCAMPA
AFTER WE'RE GONE?

1487
01:24:00,577 --> 01:24:05,666
CAPTAIN, ANY ACTION WE TAKE
TO PROTECT THE OCAMPA

1488
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:09,670
WOULD AFFECT THE BALANCE
OF POWER IN THIS SYSTEM.

1489
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:12,756
THE PRIME DIRECTIVE
WOULD SEEM TO APPLY.

1490
01:24:12,756 --> 01:24:14,508
WOULD IT?

1491
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:21,932
WE NEVER ASKED TO BE INVOLVED,
TUVOK...

1492
01:24:21,932 --> 01:24:24,643
BUT WE ARE.

1493
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:28,480
WE ARE.

1494
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:37,031
MR. TUVOK,
READY THE TRICOBALT DEVICES.

1495
01:24:37,031 --> 01:24:38,407
Tuvok:
AYE, CAPTAIN.

1496
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:40,283
OPEN A CHANNEL TO THE KAZON.

1497
01:24:40,283 --> 01:24:42,118
Kim:
CHANNEL OPEN.

1498
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:44,120
I have called
for additional ships.

1499
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:48,124
I'M CALLING TO WARN YOU TO MOVE
YOUR VESSELS TO A SAFE DISTANCE.

1500
01:24:48,124 --> 01:24:50,085
I INTEND TO DESTROY THE ARRAY.

1501
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:51,545
You can't do that.

1502
01:24:51,545 --> 01:24:53,630
Janeway:
I CAN AND I WILL.

1503
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:54,924
END TRANSMISSION.

1504
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:58,218
THEY'RE INCREASING
FIRE, CAPTAIN.

1505
01:24:58,218 --> 01:24:59,636
SHIELDS ARE HOLDING.

1506
01:24:59,636 --> 01:25:03,766
MOVE US 400 KILOMETERS
FROM THE ARRAY, MR. PARIS.

1507
01:25:03,766 --> 01:25:07,269
Torres:
THAT ARRAY IS THE ONLY
WAY WE HAVE TO GET HOME.

1508
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:10,731
I'M AWARE EVERYONE
HAS FAMILIES AT HOME.

1509
01:25:10,731 --> 01:25:14,276
SO DO I, BUT I'M NOT WILLING
TO TRADE THE LIVES OF THE OCAMPA

1510
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:16,152
FOR OUR CONVENIENCE.

1511
01:25:16,152 --> 01:25:17,446
WE'LL HAVE TO FIND
ANOTHER WAY HOME.

1512
01:25:17,446 --> 01:25:19,364
WHAT OTHER WAY
HOME IS THERE?

1513
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:22,618
WHO IS SHE TO BE MAKING
THESE DECISIONS FOR ALL OF US?

1514
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:24,578
SHE'S THE CAPTAIN.

1515
01:25:25,746 --> 01:25:27,289
THE TRICOBALT DEVICE

1516
01:25:27,289 --> 01:25:28,498
IS READY.

1517
01:25:28,498 --> 01:25:30,584
Paris:
WE'RE IN POSITION.

1518
01:25:35,839 --> 01:25:37,549
FIRE.

1519
01:26:01,949 --> 01:26:04,576
THE LEAD KAZON SHIP
IS HAILING US.

1520
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:06,578
ON SCREEN.

1521
01:26:08,622 --> 01:26:12,250
You have made an enemy today.

1522
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:15,712
Tuvok:
THEY ARE WITHDRAWING, CAPTAIN.

1523
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:24,972
(<i> door chimes</i> )

1524
01:26:24,972 --> 01:26:27,141
COME IN.

1525
01:26:28,767 --> 01:26:30,811
YOU ASKED TO
SEE ME, CAPTAIN?

1526
01:26:30,811 --> 01:26:32,688
MR. PARIS...

1527
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:35,482
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

1528
01:26:35,482 --> 01:26:37,776
I'VE INVITED CHAKOTAY

1529
01:26:37,776 --> 01:26:40,362
AND THE OTHER MAQUIS
TO BECOME PART OF THIS CREW.

1530
01:26:40,362 --> 01:26:43,157
IT SEEMED THE ONLY
REASONABLE THING TO DO.

1531
01:26:43,157 --> 01:26:46,284
WILL YOU PROVIDE
A BODYGUARD FOR ME, CAPTAIN?

1532
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:48,078
IT SEEMS YOU ALREADY HAVE ONE.

1533
01:26:48,078 --> 01:26:49,913
I DO?

1534
01:26:49,913 --> 01:26:53,625
MR. CHAKOTAY SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT HIS LIFE BELONGING TO YOU.

1535
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:56,045
HE'LL BE TAKING
RESPONSIBILITY

1536
01:26:56,045 --> 01:26:57,546
FOR YOUR SAFETY.

1537
01:26:57,546 --> 01:27:00,549
I THINK I'M GOING
TO ENJOY THIS.

1538
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:02,134
DON'T BE SO SURE.

1539
01:27:02,134 --> 01:27:04,720
HE'LL ALSO BE MY FIRST OFFICER.

1540
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:07,931
EVERYONE ABOARD THIS SHIP
WILL REPORT TO HIM

1541
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:11,226
INCLUDING THE LIEUTENANT
ASSIGNED TO CONN.

1542
01:27:12,268 --> 01:27:13,896
ME?

1543
01:27:13,896 --> 01:27:17,524
I'VE ENTERED INTO THE SHIP'S LOG
ON THIS DATE

1544
01:27:17,524 --> 01:27:21,403
THAT I'M GRANTING
A FIELD COMMISSION OF LIEUTENANT

1545
01:27:21,403 --> 01:27:23,864
TO THOMAS EUGENE PARIS.

1546
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:28,660
CONGRATULATIONS.

1547
01:27:31,788 --> 01:27:34,166
UM, FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN MY LIFE

1548
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:35,918
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

1549
01:27:35,918 --> 01:27:37,961
YOU'VE EARNED THIS, TOM.

1550
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:40,964
I'M ONLY SORRY YOUR
FATHER WON'T KNOW.

1551
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:42,674
OH, HE'LL KNOW...

1552
01:27:44,426 --> 01:27:46,386
WHEN WE GET BACK.

1553
01:27:46,386 --> 01:27:49,556
CAPTAIN, WE WERE
JUST COMING TO SEE YOU.

1554
01:27:49,556 --> 01:27:52,059
WE'VE SUPPLIED YOUR SHIP
WITH WATER, NEELIX.

1555
01:27:52,059 --> 01:27:53,268
IT'S READY TO GO.

1556
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:54,686
WELL, YOU SEE

1557
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:57,106
THAT'S WHAT WE
WANTED TO DISCUSS.

1558
01:27:57,106 --> 01:27:58,941
WE'D LIKE TO GO WITH YOU.

1559
01:27:58,941 --> 01:28:01,944
I'M SORRY. THIS ISN'T
A PASSENGER SHIP.

1560
01:28:01,944 --> 01:28:03,403
Kes:
OF COURSE NOT.

1561
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:05,072
WE WON'T BE
PASSENGERS.

1562
01:28:05,072 --> 01:28:06,823
WE'LL BE VALUABLE
COLLEAGUES.

1563
01:28:06,823 --> 01:28:08,992
"COLLEAGUES"?

1564
01:28:08,992 --> 01:28:11,578
WHATEVER YOU NEED IS
WHAT I HAVE TO OFFER.

1565
01:28:11,578 --> 01:28:13,830
YOU NEED A GUIDE,
I'M YOUR GUIDE.

1566
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:16,750
YOU NEED SUPPLIES, I KNOW
WHERE TO PROCURE THEM.

1567
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:18,376
I HAVE FRIENDS
AMONG RACES

1568
01:28:18,376 --> 01:28:20,336
YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW EXIST.

1569
01:28:20,336 --> 01:28:22,589
YOU NEED A COOK?
YOU HAVEN'T LIVED

1570
01:28:22,589 --> 01:28:25,008
UNTIL YOU'VE TASTED
MY ANGLA'BOSQUE.

1571
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:28,178
IT WILL BE MY JOB TO
ANTICIPATE YOUR NEEDS

1572
01:28:28,178 --> 01:28:30,222
BEFORE YOU KNOW
YOU HAVE THEM

1573
01:28:30,222 --> 01:28:32,474
AND I ANTICIPATE
YOUR FIRST NEED

1574
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:33,850
WILL BE ME.

1575
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:36,019
Kes:
CAPTAIN, WE BOTH

1576
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:40,065
WANT VERY MUCH TO BE
A PART OF YOUR JOURNEY.

1577
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:58,834
WE'RE ALONE IN
AN UNCHARTED PART OF THE GALAXY.

1578
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:01,878
WE'VE ALREADY MADE
SOME FRIENDS HERE

1579
01:29:01,878 --> 01:29:04,840
AND SOME ENEMIES.

1580
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:09,303
WE HAVE NO IDEA OF THE DANGERS
WE'RE GOING TO FACE.

1581
01:29:09,303 --> 01:29:11,346
BUT ONE THING IS CLEAR.

1582
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:14,850
BOTH CREWS ARE GOING
TO HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER

1583
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:17,269
IF WE'RE TO SURVIVE.

1584
01:29:17,269 --> 01:29:20,022
THAT'S WHY COMMANDER CHAKOTAY
AND I HAVE AGREED

1585
01:29:20,022 --> 01:29:22,607
THAT THIS SHOULD BE ONE CREW--

1586
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:25,443
A STARFLEET CREW.

1587
01:29:25,443 --> 01:29:29,614
AND AS THE ONLY STARFLEET VESSEL
ASSIGNED TO THE DELTA QUADRANT

1588
01:29:29,614 --> 01:29:32,659
WE'LL CONTINUE
TO FOLLOW OUR DIRECTIVE

1589
01:29:32,659 --> 01:29:36,288
TO SEEK OUT NEW WORLDS
AND EXPLORE SPACE.

1590
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:41,626
BUT OUR PRIMARY GOAL IS CLEAR.

1591
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:43,545
EVEN AT MAXIMUM SPEEDS,

1592
01:29:43,545 --> 01:29:47,174
IT WOULD TAKE 75 YEARS
TO REACH THE FEDERATION

1593
01:29:47,174 --> 01:29:50,135
BUT I'M NOT WILLING
TO SETTLE FOR THAT.

1594
01:29:50,135 --> 01:29:52,888
THERE'S ANOTHER ENTITY
LIKE THE CARETAKER

1595
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:54,472
OUT THERE SOMEWHERE

1596
01:29:54,472 --> 01:29:57,600
WHO HAS THE ABILITY
TO GET US THERE A LOT FASTER.

1597
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,186
WE'LL BE LOOKING FOR HER,

1598
01:29:59,186 --> 01:30:03,357
AND WE'LL BE LOOKING
FOR WORMHOLES, SPATIAL RIFTS

1599
01:30:03,357 --> 01:30:05,859
OR NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO HELP US.

1600
01:30:07,736 --> 01:30:12,241
SOMEWHERE, ALONG THIS JOURNEY,

1601
01:30:12,241 --> 01:30:15,744
WE'LL FIND A WAY BACK.

1602
01:30:15,744 --> 01:30:19,748
MR. PARIS, SET A COURSE...

1603
01:30:19,748 --> 01:30:21,791
FOR HOME.

1604
01:30:21,791 --> 01:30:23,877
AYE, CAPTAIN.
