1
00:00:01,896 --> 00:00:03,491
He only paid for one hour.

2
00:00:03,534 --> 00:00:05,802
He's been in there for three

3
00:00:05,841 --> 00:00:07,904
fighting the Battle
of Klachdachbrach

4
00:00:07,947 --> 00:00:10,010
or some such thing,
over and over.

5
00:00:10,053 --> 00:00:11,887
The Battle
of Klach D'kel Brakt

6
00:00:11,924 --> 00:00:14,864
is a legendary Klingon victory
over the Romulans

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,199
almost a century ago.

8
00:00:16,237 --> 00:00:18,802
Well, he's been
losing it all afternoon

9
00:00:18,844 --> 00:00:21,043
and he says
he's not coming out

10
00:00:21,084 --> 00:00:22,417
until he wins.

11
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:24,722
I banged on the door,
he sealed himself in.

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,560
I threatened
to shut off the power

13
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:28,399
he threatened to kill me.

14
00:00:28,438 --> 00:00:29,771
Oh...

15
00:00:43,078 --> 00:00:45,516
Since when did you add
ancient Klingon battles

16
00:00:45,552 --> 00:00:46,988
to your holosuite programs?

17
00:00:47,022 --> 00:00:48,925
The Captain
of the last Klingon ship

18
00:00:48,962 --> 00:00:51,492
that went through the wormhole
sold some to me.

19
00:00:51,536 --> 00:00:52,562
Ahh...

20
00:00:52,606 --> 00:00:53,939
I know, I know.

21
00:00:53,976 --> 00:00:56,448
It's brutal...
it's violent.

22
00:00:56,482 --> 00:00:58,009
It's bloody.

23
00:00:58,053 --> 00:01:01,153
But to the Klingons,
it's entertainment.

24
00:01:01,196 --> 00:01:02,256
Shut off the power.

25
00:01:02,366 --> 00:01:03,596
He'll kill you.

26
00:01:03,636 --> 00:01:06,006
No, he said he'll kill you.

27
00:01:06,043 --> 00:01:07,911
Shut it off.

28
00:01:18,176 --> 00:01:20,648
<i>Chay'pen Aha'bA?</i>

29
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:29,638
<i>Ar ghot k'Nel D'kulluH</i>

30
00:01:29,675 --> 00:01:32,410
<i>marg raH gol low!</i>

31
00:01:34,088 --> 00:01:39,730
You dare interrupt the Battle
of Klach D'kel Brakt

32
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,242
you Ferengi <i>k'pekt!</i>

33
00:01:45,252 --> 00:01:46,722
The battle is over.

34
00:01:46,757 --> 00:01:48,625
The people are
waiting to celebrate

35
00:01:48,662 --> 00:01:49,631
your victory.

36
00:01:49,665 --> 00:01:51,431
They are?

37
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,339
Lead the way, then!

38
00:02:36,128 --> 00:02:38,191
How did you get in here?

39
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:40,136
I am Koloth.

40
00:02:40,173 --> 00:02:41,939
That doesn't answer
my question.

41
00:02:41,977 --> 00:02:43,572
Yes, it does.

42
00:02:43,615 --> 00:02:46,087
What are the charges
against him?

43
00:02:46,122 --> 00:02:47,717
Charges?

44
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,492
No charges.

45
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,334
He's today's guest of honor.

46
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:56,282
You must be a very brave man
to attempt humor

47
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:59,919
at the expense
of a Klingon <i>Dahar</i> Master.

48
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,634
I apologize.

49
00:03:04,674 --> 00:03:06,873
No offense intended.

50
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:15,363
Kor!

51
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:21,244
Sir...

52
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:22,518
if you'll wake up

53
00:03:22,558 --> 00:03:25,225
I'll release you
into your friend's custody.

54
00:03:25,265 --> 00:03:26,564
Oh.

55
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,506
Oh, Koloth.

56
00:03:31,817 --> 00:03:33,184
<i>Wlj jup...</i>

57
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:34,554
my old friend.

58
00:03:34,658 --> 00:03:36,687
Oh, I knew you'd be here.

59
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:40,069
You disgrace yourself
and our purpose.

60
00:03:40,106 --> 00:03:42,476
I do not go into battle

61
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:48,086
with one whose honor is
washed away in brestanti ale.

62
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:49,428
Keep him!

63
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,398
Security reassignments, Major.

64
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:06,530
Sorry it took so long.

65
00:06:06,572 --> 00:06:08,304
It's been a Klingon afternoon.

66
00:06:08,344 --> 00:06:09,608
"A Klingon afternoon"?

67
00:06:09,647 --> 00:06:11,915
Every time Klingons
visit the station

68
00:06:11,953 --> 00:06:14,152
I wind up
with a Klingon afternoon.

69
00:06:14,226 --> 00:06:17,292
But this is definitely one
I'll cherish forever.

70
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:20,505
There's a drunken Klingon
in my holding cell...

71
00:06:20,545 --> 00:06:22,106
must be
a hundred years old...

72
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:23,413
singing battle songs.

73
00:06:23,453 --> 00:06:24,615
Even his best friend...

74
00:06:24,656 --> 00:06:26,183
who's probably
150 years old...

75
00:06:26,227 --> 00:06:28,130
won't have anything
to do with him

76
00:06:28,165 --> 00:06:31,037
so I get the pleasure
of listening to his repertoire.

77
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:33,639
Kor, <i>Dahar</i> Master
of the Klingons.

78
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:35,311
Did you say "Kor"?

79
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:37,551
That's what he announced,
right after winning

80
00:06:37,592 --> 00:06:40,658
the Battle of Klach
D'kel Brakt at Quark's.

81
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:42,535
What is he doing here?

82
00:06:42,572 --> 00:06:44,509
Did you get his friend's name?

83
00:06:44,545 --> 00:06:45,673
Was it Kang?

84
00:06:45,715 --> 00:06:46,741
No, it was...

85
00:06:46,785 --> 00:06:49,223
- Koloth.
- Koloth.

86
00:06:50,294 --> 00:06:51,958
Come with me, Odo.

87
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:59,551
<i>B'aski't Kor, B'askr'ip Kor</i>

88
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:04,727
<i>KoHman-a-tl, B'aski't Kor.</i>

89
00:07:07,877 --> 00:07:09,849
Hello, Kor.

90
00:07:09,882 --> 00:07:12,081
I am thirsty.

91
00:07:12,121 --> 00:07:13,751
Let him out.

92
00:07:13,793 --> 00:07:14,921
Lieutenant...

93
00:07:14,964 --> 00:07:16,628
I'll take responsibility.

94
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:21,946
I am very thirsty.

95
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:25,322
Kor, do you remember
Curzon Dax?

96
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,462
Curzon?

97
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:31,441
Oh, my dear friend Curzon?

98
00:07:31,476 --> 00:07:36,148
I lift my <i>ghoptu</i>
to Curzon Dax, mm-hmm.

99
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:42,001
And I, who was Curzon Dax,
lift my <i>ghoptu</i> to you.

100
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:44,477
Oh.

101
00:07:44,513 --> 00:07:47,510
Scorcher burn
on your 14th rib...

102
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:48,956
Huh?

103
00:07:48,992 --> 00:07:53,163
And your left <i>QiVon</i> aches

104
00:07:53,203 --> 00:07:56,269
every time your ship
hits warp eight.

105
00:07:56,312 --> 00:07:58,249
Dax?!

106
00:08:01,092 --> 00:08:03,189
My C-Curzon?

107
00:08:04,802 --> 00:08:07,240
After 81 years, I...

108
00:08:07,276 --> 00:08:10,718
I find you a <i>kyamo-</i>
looking woman.

109
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:13,085
Kiss me!

110
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:15,155
How about just
a great big hug?

111
00:08:15,198 --> 00:08:18,503
Oh, Curzon,
my beloved old friend.

112
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,536
I'm Jadzia now.

113
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:24,921
Oh, well, Jadzia,
my beloved old friend.

114
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:29,402
Come on, Kor,
let's go find Koloth.

115
00:08:29,438 --> 00:08:31,136
Koloth's here?

116
00:08:49,628 --> 00:08:50,995
Look at him.

117
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:54,473
He practices cuts and thrusts
even with his food.

118
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,239
Little children do that.

119
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,189
A sharp knife is nothing

120
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:01,591
without a sharp eye.

121
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:02,824
Ooh.

122
00:09:02,864 --> 00:09:04,596
Mmm, it's been 40 years

123
00:09:04,637 --> 00:09:07,132
since even his good eye
was sharp.

124
00:09:07,177 --> 00:09:09,878
Ah, it's luck
when you hit the plate.

125
00:09:09,918 --> 00:09:12,152
I see that the Federation
insults us

126
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,425
by sending a Lieutenant
to greet us.

127
00:09:14,463 --> 00:09:16,161
You never had much use
for the Federation

128
00:09:16,202 --> 00:09:17,330
did you, Koloth?

129
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:19,035
I used to call you

130
00:09:19,077 --> 00:09:22,314
<i>D'akturak,</i> "ice man,"
because no proposal...

131
00:09:22,352 --> 00:09:25,486
no matter how reasonable,
no matter how much

132
00:09:25,595 --> 00:09:27,829
it favored the
Klingon Empire...

133
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:29,600
would satisfy you.

134
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,508
You were the toughest man

135
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,985
I ever faced across
the negotiations table.

136
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:41,135
Do you not recognize
our old friend, Dax, hmm?

137
00:09:45,684 --> 00:09:46,778
Dax?

138
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:53,596
Curzon's dead, but Dax
is alive as a part of me.

139
00:09:57,618 --> 00:09:59,054
This is a mistake.

140
00:09:59,088 --> 00:10:01,151
Kang must not have known.

141
00:10:01,194 --> 00:10:03,598
Ah, but what
a beautiful mistake, hmm?

142
00:10:03,702 --> 00:10:05,001
Is Kang coming?

143
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,804
Of course he's coming.

144
00:10:06,843 --> 00:10:10,752
He's brought the four of us
back together after 81 years.

145
00:10:10,787 --> 00:10:12,952
Could it possibly mean
that he's...

146
00:10:12,994 --> 00:10:14,122
Yes.

147
00:10:14,164 --> 00:10:17,161
That is exactly what it means.

148
00:10:17,206 --> 00:10:20,009
I have found the Albino.

149
00:10:20,047 --> 00:10:21,517
Ah.

150
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:30,438
Kang, do you remember

151
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:33,177
the first time we sat
together over <i>bahgol?</i>

152
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:34,847
It was the Korvat colony.

153
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:37,327
The Federation
and the Klingon Empire

154
00:10:37,362 --> 00:10:38,626
were still enemies.

155
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:42,632
I never sat with you
before today.

156
00:10:42,677 --> 00:10:44,808
I am Dax

157
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,118
godfather of your son.

158
00:10:47,156 --> 00:10:49,492
You are no one's godfather.

159
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:52,936
I am Dax,
godfather of your son.

160
00:10:52,972 --> 00:10:57,918
So, you are the same Dax
who took a blood oath with us

161
00:10:57,953 --> 00:11:00,050
to seek vengeance?

162
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:03,329
Don't mistake a new face
for a new soul, Kang.

163
00:11:03,368 --> 00:11:05,636
I still feel at one
with your family

164
00:11:05,674 --> 00:11:07,703
just as I did
eight decades ago.

165
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,914
I hope one day, you'll embrace
me as a brother again.

166
00:11:10,956 --> 00:11:12,426
Brother, ha!

167
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,397
Oh, brother, sister,
what's the difference?

168
00:11:14,432 --> 00:11:15,731
We're all here now.

169
00:11:15,802 --> 00:11:17,933
Speak to us, Kang.
Where is he?

170
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:21,473
Where did you find
the Albino?

171
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,292
Seven years ago... on Dayos IV

172
00:11:25,329 --> 00:11:30,207
I met one of the Albino's
discarded wives.

173
00:11:30,243 --> 00:11:32,773
I fed and clothed her.

174
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:36,590
I told her
the story of our sons.

175
00:11:36,628 --> 00:11:40,765
She still feared him,
and told me nothing.

176
00:11:40,806 --> 00:11:43,439
Three months ago, she died.

177
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,688
A week afterward, an amulet
she wore around her neck

178
00:11:48,728 --> 00:11:51,965
was delivered to me
by messenger.

179
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:56,950
In it was the location
of the Albino's sanctuary.

180
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:59,958
Are you certain
that he's still there?

181
00:11:59,993 --> 00:12:03,697
I have confirmed it
with traders who supply him.

182
00:12:03,736 --> 00:12:07,611
It is on the fourth planet
of the Secarus system.

183
00:12:07,647 --> 00:12:09,550
He has been hiding there

184
00:12:09,586 --> 00:12:12,287
for nearly a quarter
of a century.

185
00:12:12,328 --> 00:12:14,766
Hiding from us, no doubt.

186
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:18,676
I have been told he only has
40 men in his compound.

187
00:12:18,712 --> 00:12:22,279
Evidently, he's become very lax
in his waning years.

188
00:12:23,893 --> 00:12:25,260
The fool.

189
00:12:25,297 --> 00:12:27,394
I wouldn't count
on information from traders.

190
00:12:27,436 --> 00:12:29,339
The Albino might have
told them what to say

191
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,537
if anyone asks questions.

192
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:31,775
She's right.

193
00:12:31,815 --> 00:12:33,683
The traders may
already have warned him

194
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,882
that we are coming.

195
00:12:34,957 --> 00:12:38,695
They will never
warn anyone ever again.

196
00:12:38,734 --> 00:12:42,107
This time, we will reach
the Albino

197
00:12:42,144 --> 00:12:47,113
and when we do, I will cut
his heart out and eat it

198
00:12:47,158 --> 00:12:51,261
while he watches me
with his dying breath.

199
00:13:02,969 --> 00:13:04,906
I did not know, of course.

200
00:13:04,974 --> 00:13:06,501
About Curzon?

201
00:13:06,545 --> 00:13:10,579
I did not want to risk
contacting you by subspace.

202
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,094
I don't blame you.

203
00:13:12,127 --> 00:13:15,534
That's how the Albino learned
we were coming to Galdonterre.

204
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,271
He has ears that reach
across the galaxy.

205
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:20,841
I don't know how.

206
00:13:20,886 --> 00:13:24,453
Tell me about
my good friend, Curzon.

207
00:13:24,495 --> 00:13:27,230
Did he die
an honorable death?

208
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,504
He died
in a hospital room

209
00:13:29,544 --> 00:13:31,447
yelling at doctors
and friends

210
00:13:31,482 --> 00:13:33,511
who were trying
to keep him alive

211
00:13:33,555 --> 00:13:35,355
for one more miserable day.

212
00:13:35,393 --> 00:13:37,159
Oh, that's a pity.

213
00:13:37,197 --> 00:13:38,997
He was a good man.

214
00:13:39,037 --> 00:13:41,441
He deserved to die in battle.

215
00:13:41,476 --> 00:13:45,493
It pains me that I will never
see him again in this life.

216
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:50,162
Curzon was decorated many times
for his diplomatic achievements

217
00:13:50,206 --> 00:13:53,375
but no honor touched him
as deeply as yours.

218
00:13:53,482 --> 00:13:56,787
For a Klingon to choose
a Federation official

219
00:13:56,825 --> 00:13:59,229
to be the godfather
of his son...

220
00:13:59,265 --> 00:14:05,181
Curzon Dax opened
the door to peace.

221
00:14:05,215 --> 00:14:08,679
He was the first Federation
diplomat I ever met

222
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:12,361
who truly seemed to understand
the Klingon nature.

223
00:14:12,469 --> 00:14:15,535
Well, there was always a bit
of Klingon nature in Curzon.

224
00:14:15,577 --> 00:14:19,817
His blood oath with you
was very important to him.

225
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:27,068
Would you eat from the heart
of the Albino, Jadzia Dax?

226
00:14:27,109 --> 00:14:29,104
I know about the Trills

227
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:32,283
from my long friendship
with Curzon.

228
00:14:32,323 --> 00:14:34,123
And I know that each new host

229
00:14:34,163 --> 00:14:36,533
has no obligation
to past commitments.

230
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:39,372
And I know
that a Klingon blood oath

231
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,040
can never be broken.

232
00:14:43,689 --> 00:14:46,356
The old Klingon ways
are passing.

233
00:14:46,397 --> 00:14:49,770
There was a time
when I was a young man

234
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:54,582
the mere mention of the Klingon
Empire made worlds tremble.

235
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:59,463
Now our warriors are opening
restaurants and serving <i>racht</i>

236
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,774
to the grandchildren
of men I slaughtered in battle.

237
00:15:03,812 --> 00:15:06,718
Things are not
what they used to be

238
00:15:06,753 --> 00:15:08,782
not even the blood oath.

239
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:09,988
I know you, Kang.

240
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:11,624
You don't believe that.

241
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:15,074
What I believe
is no longer relevant.

242
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:18,415
You are released
from Curzon's oath.

243
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:21,255
You owe nothing to any of us.

244
00:15:25,038 --> 00:15:26,668
Are you still reading

245
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:28,840
a plasma leak
in Lower Pylon One?

246
00:15:28,882 --> 00:15:30,648
I can't seem to find it now.

247
00:15:30,687 --> 00:15:32,214
It's been intermittent.

248
00:15:32,258 --> 00:15:34,423
Let me do
a high-resolution scan.

249
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,133
Kira...

250
00:15:38,175 --> 00:15:39,439
Uh-huh?

251
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,317
How many people did you kill?

252
00:15:45,428 --> 00:15:47,092
What?

253
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:49,800
While you were
in the underground.

254
00:15:52,982 --> 00:15:54,315
Too many.

255
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,761
Were they all...
faceless Cardassians

256
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:01,534
or did you know
who you were killing?

257
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:03,407
Why are we talking
about this?

258
00:16:03,445 --> 00:16:05,245
If it bothers you,
we can stop.

259
00:16:05,283 --> 00:16:06,547
It bothers me.

260
00:16:06,621 --> 00:16:07,885
I'm sorry.

261
00:16:12,303 --> 00:16:13,567
Why?

262
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,047
Were you thinking
about killing somebody?

263
00:16:17,084 --> 00:16:19,579
Me?

264
00:16:24,637 --> 00:16:25,901
Tell me.

265
00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:29,042
I don't know
what you're talking about.

266
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,519
Tell me.

267
00:16:38,142 --> 00:16:42,986
80 years ago, there was
a band of depredators

268
00:16:43,022 --> 00:16:47,558
led by an Albino
raiding Klingon colonies.

269
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:51,669
Three Klingon warships
were sent to stop him.

270
00:16:51,747 --> 00:16:56,625
One of the Captains was
a close friend of Curzon's.

271
00:16:56,661 --> 00:16:59,099
The mission was successful.

272
00:16:59,134 --> 00:17:04,342
Most of them were captured,
but the Albino escaped.

273
00:17:04,382 --> 00:17:08,553
In his last message
to the Klingons

274
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:12,195
he promised to take revenge

275
00:17:12,238 --> 00:17:16,683
on the firstborn of each
of the three Captains.

276
00:17:16,717 --> 00:17:19,247
A few years later,
he kept his word.

277
00:17:21,263 --> 00:17:26,905
Somehow, he infected
three innocent children

278
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:31,857
with a genetic virus
that killed them.

279
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:37,407
One of them was my godson.

280
00:17:37,441 --> 00:17:39,436
I'm sorry.

281
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,753
But, Jadzia...

282
00:17:42,823 --> 00:17:45,193
that was Curzon's godson.

283
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,728
I took a blood oath
to avenge his death.

284
00:17:48,772 --> 00:17:51,142
Curzon took a blood oath.

285
00:17:52,985 --> 00:17:55,857
I can still remember
the boy's funeral.

286
00:17:57,932 --> 00:18:00,336
He was named Dax, for me.

287
00:18:07,258 --> 00:18:09,287
You've found this Albino?

288
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,629
We know where he is.

289
00:18:10,668 --> 00:18:13,471
The three Klingons
came here to tell me...

290
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,746
Look, you've said yourself
every new life for a Trill

291
00:18:16,785 --> 00:18:18,118
has to be a new life.

292
00:18:18,155 --> 00:18:21,324
If not, you'd wind up
paying off old debts forever.

293
00:18:21,364 --> 00:18:23,894
These Klingons can't
possibly expect you

294
00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:25,100
to keep this oath.

295
00:18:25,141 --> 00:18:26,805
No, they don't.

296
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,919
That's just it.

297
00:18:29,954 --> 00:18:34,228
They say I have
no obligation to them.

298
00:18:34,266 --> 00:18:36,534
But I do.

299
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,841
I know it, I feel it.

300
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,262
If not to them,
I owe it to Curzon.

301
00:18:45,297 --> 00:18:47,269
Jadzia...

302
00:18:49,275 --> 00:18:51,247
your questions about my...

303
00:18:51,281 --> 00:18:53,184
experience with killing...

304
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:56,125
if you're wondering
what it's like...

305
00:18:58,701 --> 00:19:01,402
When you take someone's life

306
00:19:01,443 --> 00:19:05,079
you lose a part
of your own, as well.

307
00:19:10,134 --> 00:19:12,106
I need another arm.

308
00:19:14,713 --> 00:19:16,810
Or am I doomed to choose

309
00:19:16,853 --> 00:19:19,827
between perfection
and the palate?

310
00:19:21,097 --> 00:19:23,969
Let me spare you
that decision.

311
00:19:24,975 --> 00:19:26,970
Mmm! Mmm... mmm.

312
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,312
Ah...

313
00:19:30,657 --> 00:19:31,990
<i>majQa'.</i>

314
00:19:33,231 --> 00:19:35,830
To the rescue.

315
00:19:35,872 --> 00:19:39,872
Dax, may I present
these two... students

316
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:42,219
of... Klingon history.

317
00:19:42,256 --> 00:19:44,251
Would you excuse us
for a minute?

318
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:46,199
Hmm?

319
00:19:46,234 --> 00:19:50,440
Ooh, well, only a minute,
my students.

320
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,568
Well, you certainly don't
share Curzon's priorities.

321
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,544
About going after the Albino,
I do.

322
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:04,813
Kang and Koloth

323
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:06,207
don't want me
to come with you.

324
00:20:06,341 --> 00:20:08,438
Well, Kang thinks too much.

325
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,782
Koloth doesn't feel enough.

326
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,723
And where do you stand?

327
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:13,989
Huh? Hmm?

328
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:15,659
Oh, of course
you should come.

329
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,968
The splendor of fighting
and killing

330
00:20:18,006 --> 00:20:20,376
a bloodbath in the cause
of vengeance...

331
00:20:20,447 --> 00:20:22,111
who wouldn't want to come?

332
00:20:22,152 --> 00:20:24,089
Would you speak
to them for me?

333
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:27,724
It means far more to me
than I realized.

334
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:30,332
Hmm, Koloth spends
all his time

335
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,813
practicing in the holosuite.

336
00:20:32,848 --> 00:20:34,648
He listens to no one.

337
00:20:34,686 --> 00:20:39,393
And if Kang's made up his mind,
there's nothing I can do.

338
00:20:39,433 --> 00:20:43,376
And you call yourself
a history teacher?

339
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:45,941
What of your own history?

340
00:20:45,985 --> 00:20:48,686
You are Kor, <i>Dahar</i> Master.

341
00:20:48,726 --> 00:20:51,997
They cheered you
at Klach D'kel Brakt.

342
00:20:52,035 --> 00:20:56,206
Your voice weighed heavily on
the course of Klingon events.

343
00:20:58,854 --> 00:21:00,518
You shame me.

344
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,089
No, please don't feel that.

345
00:21:04,737 --> 00:21:08,977
Huh! The only weight
I carry now, dear comrade

346
00:21:09,016 --> 00:21:11,649
is... is my own bulbous body.

347
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,793
I... I was once,
if you remember

348
00:21:15,835 --> 00:21:19,038
far less than you see...

349
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:23,248
and far more
than I have become.

350
00:21:26,565 --> 00:21:28,263
I'm sorry.

351
00:21:29,573 --> 00:21:35,021
My memories are still
of Kor, a great warrior.

352
00:21:44,014 --> 00:21:45,951
Quark, you...

353
00:21:45,986 --> 00:21:48,254
devious little <i>Ha'DIBah!</i>

354
00:21:48,293 --> 00:21:50,458
Bring wine.

355
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,798
Nice of you to stop.

356
00:22:27,836 --> 00:22:30,605
I'm coming with you.

357
00:22:30,678 --> 00:22:33,150
Curzon Dax was a politician.

358
00:22:33,184 --> 00:22:36,215
It was a diplomatic ploy
for him to bond himself

359
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,732
to us in a blood oath.

360
00:22:38,766 --> 00:22:41,204
That's a lie.

361
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,009
Are... you?

362
00:22:44,048 --> 00:22:45,643
I am practicing here.

363
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,315
Leave while you can.

364
00:22:47,357 --> 00:22:50,560
When you agree that I can
fulfill my part of the oath.

365
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,201
Your presence will jeopardize
the rest of us.

366
00:22:54,243 --> 00:22:55,645
Leave me.

367
00:22:55,681 --> 00:22:58,519
Computer, I want
a Klingon <i>bat'leth.</i>

368
00:22:58,555 --> 00:23:01,085
Tip to tip
116 centimeters

369
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,998
weight 5.3 kilos

370
00:23:03,034 --> 00:23:07,638
with an exterior hand-gripping
diameter of five centimeters.

371
00:23:07,747 --> 00:23:11,052
Blades composite <i>baakonite.</i>

372
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,289
Ah, a warrior's configuration.

373
00:23:13,329 --> 00:23:16,395
Now what are you going
to do with it?

374
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,676
I'm going to fight you.

375
00:23:19,748 --> 00:23:24,888
And if my hand should slip,
and you should die?

376
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:26,695
Your hand would never slip

377
00:23:26,734 --> 00:23:29,070
unless you've become
old and feeble.

378
00:23:45,553 --> 00:23:48,220
Come on, Koloth,
surely you can take me down.

379
00:24:07,748 --> 00:24:11,521
There is tension
on your face, Koloth.

380
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:14,192
You ought to drink more.

381
00:24:32,385 --> 00:24:33,787
Stand up.

382
00:24:37,231 --> 00:24:41,608
Your presence
against the Albino

383
00:24:41,643 --> 00:24:45,416
will do honor to our cause.

384
00:24:48,095 --> 00:24:53,407
Well, that's a surprise
from the great stone face.

385
00:24:53,443 --> 00:24:55,415
Releasing you
from Curzon's oath

386
00:24:55,449 --> 00:24:56,611
is not enough.

387
00:24:56,652 --> 00:24:58,282
I can see that now.

388
00:24:58,323 --> 00:24:59,292
It is agreed then.

389
00:24:59,326 --> 00:25:00,625
No!

390
00:25:00,663 --> 00:25:04,572
I tell you now, you will
not be part of the quest.

391
00:25:16,441 --> 00:25:18,036
Why do you dismiss her

392
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:20,381
like some useless
<i>t'ooho'mlrah?</i>

393
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:22,890
We cannot go
to an enemy stronghold

394
00:25:22,992 --> 00:25:24,895
with your sickly chest
announcing us.

395
00:25:24,931 --> 00:25:26,127
There is nothing...

396
00:25:26,168 --> 00:25:28,002
nothing wrong with my chest.

397
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,103
Nothing that won't
get us all killed

398
00:25:30,145 --> 00:25:31,512
before we reach battle.

399
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,519
Come.

400
00:25:32,553 --> 00:25:34,387
Ah, I need no nurse's hand.

401
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:55,646
You can't deny my right
for vengeance.

402
00:25:55,683 --> 00:25:57,848
You try to speak
like a Klingon

403
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,556
but the words do not
fit in your mouth.

404
00:26:00,597 --> 00:26:03,035
You said that to me before,
Kang, do you remember?

405
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:06,409
I do not wish to discuss it
any further.

406
00:26:06,447 --> 00:26:09,718
The Korvat colony.

407
00:26:09,756 --> 00:26:13,563
First day of negotiations,
I walked out on you

408
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,631
right in the middle of that
longwinded speech of yours.

409
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:19,548
You should have seen
the look on your face.

410
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:21,851
Nobody had ever
had the <i>kajanpak't</i>

411
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,294
to show their back
to the great Kang

412
00:26:24,331 --> 00:26:25,561
before Curzon did.

413
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,908
I almost killed Curzon
that day.

414
00:26:29,946 --> 00:26:33,616
I knew I had to get you
very, very angry

415
00:26:33,656 --> 00:26:36,528
or my mission wouldn't succeed.

416
00:26:36,565 --> 00:26:39,562
Getting you angry with me
was the only way

417
00:26:39,606 --> 00:26:42,307
to begin to create a bond
between us.

418
00:26:42,347 --> 00:26:46,724
Curzon understood Klingons.

419
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,994
And he also understood
what he was doing

420
00:26:49,032 --> 00:26:50,969
when he took
a Klingon blood oath.

421
00:26:51,005 --> 00:26:53,068
You can't expect me
to stay here

422
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:55,582
and not avenge
my own godson's murder.

423
00:26:55,618 --> 00:26:59,060
You can't ask me to live
with that kind of dishonor.

424
00:26:59,094 --> 00:27:01,123
I cannot dishonor myself

425
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:03,639
by allowing you to die
in Curzon's place.

426
00:27:03,673 --> 00:27:04,186
Who's talking about dying?

427
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,457
I have no intention of dying.

428
00:27:10,403 --> 00:27:12,875
You dishonor yourself
already, Kang

429
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:15,884
by placing your honor
above mine.

430
00:27:15,918 --> 00:27:18,858
No Klingon warrior would
leave a comrade behind

431
00:27:18,894 --> 00:27:20,728
while he goes off to battle.

432
00:27:22,637 --> 00:27:24,403
Perhaps you're right.

433
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,815
Klingon honor isn't
what it used to be.

434
00:27:27,852 --> 00:27:30,347
Are you trying
to anger me again?

435
00:27:30,392 --> 00:27:33,663
You think the same trick
would work twice?

436
00:27:33,702 --> 00:27:36,004
I understand Klingons.

437
00:27:36,042 --> 00:27:38,105
All right then, it worked.

438
00:27:38,147 --> 00:27:40,015
Come and fight with us.

439
00:27:40,053 --> 00:27:41,614
Come and be damned.

440
00:27:47,674 --> 00:27:48,700
Come in.

441
00:27:52,856 --> 00:27:54,828
I was just about
to come see you.

442
00:27:54,861 --> 00:27:56,160
No.

443
00:27:56,198 --> 00:27:57,428
No what?

444
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:58,664
No leave of absence.

445
00:27:58,705 --> 00:28:00,471
Kira shouldn't have told you.

446
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,344
Kira is my First Officer.

447
00:28:02,382 --> 00:28:05,653
I don't have to tell you
what this oath meant to Curzon.

448
00:28:05,691 --> 00:28:08,597
Jadzia Dax took an oath, too,
when she joined Starfleet.

449
00:28:08,633 --> 00:28:10,570
You're subject to
orders, Lieutenant.

450
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,405
Don't do it, Benjamin.

451
00:28:12,444 --> 00:28:15,475
Don't make me disobey
a direct order.

452
00:28:15,518 --> 00:28:17,250
I never understood this.

453
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:19,388
I mean, whatever
else Curzon was

454
00:28:19,429 --> 00:28:21,833
he did have
a fundamental morality.

455
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:25,141
He wouldn't condone murder
any more than I would.

456
00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:27,047
And yet he swore
to kill this Albino

457
00:28:27,084 --> 00:28:29,649
and now you plan to go out
and kill in his name.

458
00:28:29,692 --> 00:28:31,526
What about the laws
of the Federation?

459
00:28:31,563 --> 00:28:33,535
The Klingons have
their own set of laws.

460
00:28:33,603 --> 00:28:34,799
This is justice to them.

461
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:36,035
And to you?

462
00:28:36,076 --> 00:28:38,310
I've chosen to respect
their codes of honor

463
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:39,785
in this matter, yes.

464
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,817
You really think
you're capable of doing this?

465
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:46,533
I don't know.

466
00:28:46,572 --> 00:28:49,307
There's only one way
to find out, isn't there?

467
00:28:49,346 --> 00:28:51,078
Let's say you are.

468
00:28:51,118 --> 00:28:53,956
Let's say you even
survive this insanity.

469
00:28:53,993 --> 00:28:55,930
You expect to come back here

470
00:28:55,965 --> 00:28:59,635
and resume your duties,
as though nothing's happened?

471
00:29:01,414 --> 00:29:03,750
I guess that'll be up to you.

472
00:29:23,676 --> 00:29:26,114
The compound is made
of riddinite.

473
00:29:26,149 --> 00:29:28,519
There are several walls
that separate

474
00:29:28,556 --> 00:29:31,394
the main house
from the rest of the grounds.

475
00:29:31,431 --> 00:29:33,334
The main power source is here.

476
00:29:33,369 --> 00:29:36,002
There is an armory there.

477
00:29:36,044 --> 00:29:37,639
Any information about

478
00:29:37,682 --> 00:29:40,086
the positioning
of the sentries?

479
00:29:40,121 --> 00:29:42,890
They are posted
at standing intervals

480
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:45,597
75 meters apart
along the perimeter.

481
00:29:45,637 --> 00:29:47,666
Standing, no patrols?

482
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,043
That's what I'm told.

483
00:29:49,081 --> 00:29:51,110
Perhaps he thinks
we're already dead

484
00:29:51,152 --> 00:29:52,782
and have stopped chasing him.

485
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:54,692
Or perhaps he's made
his defenses look weak

486
00:29:54,796 --> 00:29:55,958
for our benefit.

487
00:29:55,999 --> 00:29:59,441
Hmm, she may be right.

488
00:29:59,476 --> 00:30:01,971
We have to assume
the guards patrol the perimeter.

489
00:30:02,016 --> 00:30:05,253
At 75 meters apart, they're out
of eye contact with each other.

490
00:30:05,292 --> 00:30:07,993
He wouldn't be that stupid.

491
00:30:08,033 --> 00:30:09,697
We must expect them to be

492
00:30:09,738 --> 00:30:12,142
no farther than...
50 meters apart.

493
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:14,743
Fine, it makes no difference.

494
00:30:14,786 --> 00:30:16,689
Doesn't it?

495
00:30:16,724 --> 00:30:19,425
If we assume he has
adequate defenses...

496
00:30:19,465 --> 00:30:21,095
a minimum of 50 guards...

497
00:30:21,136 --> 00:30:23,939
then we should use
a <i>N'yengoren</i> strategy.

498
00:30:23,977 --> 00:30:25,538
No!

499
00:30:25,582 --> 00:30:27,781
I will not sneak
into his bedroom

500
00:30:27,888 --> 00:30:30,087
and murder him
like a <i>kah'plakt.</i>

501
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:32,430
I want him to see us coming.

502
00:30:32,468 --> 00:30:37,346
I say we make a direct attack
boldly through the threshold.

503
00:30:37,381 --> 00:30:41,085
The guards will be too scattered
to defend against us.

504
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:44,099
We will overwhelm them
to glorious victory!

505
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,628
Or a glorious death.

506
00:30:48,145 --> 00:30:50,640
It is a good day to die.

507
00:30:52,658 --> 00:30:55,461
It is a good day to die.

508
00:30:55,499 --> 00:30:57,197
Come on, old comrade.

509
00:30:57,237 --> 00:31:00,838
For the last time,
let's sharpen our blades.

510
00:31:06,797 --> 00:31:09,966
So, we talk about dying again.

511
00:31:10,006 --> 00:31:14,474
A Klingon warrior is
always prepared to die.

512
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:19,226
Yes, but to invite death
with a direct assault

513
00:31:19,266 --> 00:31:21,865
against a superior force...

514
00:31:21,973 --> 00:31:25,312
Kang, what are you doing?

515
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,723
What's really going on here?

516
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:32,166
Loyalty blinds
Kor and Koloth, but not me.

517
00:31:32,202 --> 00:31:35,541
This is not a plan for battle.

518
00:31:35,578 --> 00:31:37,573
It's a plan for suicide.

519
00:31:39,288 --> 00:31:41,088
If it were someone else

520
00:31:41,127 --> 00:31:44,591
I might think you were paid
to lure us here.

521
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:45,866
How can you say that?

522
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:47,672
I took a blood oath with you.

523
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:50,709
That's why you didn't
want me to come...

524
00:31:50,753 --> 00:31:53,750
because you knew
you were coming to die.

525
00:31:55,934 --> 00:32:01,576
When the amulet arrived
with the location of the Albino

526
00:32:01,617 --> 00:32:06,859
I went to the Secarus system,
to see if it was true.

527
00:32:06,898 --> 00:32:12,072
Somehow, the instant I arrived,
the Albino knew I was there.

528
00:32:12,114 --> 00:32:14,609
He contacted me.

529
00:32:14,653 --> 00:32:21,571
He sent an invitation...
to one last glorious battle.

530
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:26,919
He said he was tired
of this lifelong pursuit.

531
00:32:26,954 --> 00:32:32,870
He swore to send 40 of his
strongest, most skilled men

532
00:32:32,905 --> 00:32:36,438
against us in honorable battle.

533
00:32:36,481 --> 00:32:38,247
And I agreed.

534
00:32:38,287 --> 00:32:40,521
But why?

535
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,794
Because...

536
00:32:42,832 --> 00:32:46,639
this is our last chance.

537
00:32:46,677 --> 00:32:48,979
If we cannot reach the Albino

538
00:32:49,016 --> 00:32:52,047
we can at least die
an honorable death

539
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,154
trying to reach him.

540
00:32:54,197 --> 00:33:01,012
A death a Klingon
<i>Dahar</i> Master deserves.

541
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:02,382
You know what, Kang?

542
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,623
I think you Klingons
embrace death too easily.

543
00:33:05,663 --> 00:33:07,897
You treat death like a lover.

544
00:33:07,936 --> 00:33:11,970
I think living is
a lot more attractive.

545
00:33:12,014 --> 00:33:13,882
I think an honorable victory

546
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,221
is better
than an honorable defeat.

547
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:19,826
I know the Albino's defenses.

548
00:33:19,869 --> 00:33:22,604
There is no chance
of victory here.

549
00:33:22,643 --> 00:33:24,546
What if they had no phasers?

550
00:33:24,582 --> 00:33:27,249
That might make the odds
a little better

551
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,851
don't you think?

552
00:33:28,895 --> 00:33:31,333
How do you intend
to disarm them all?

553
00:33:31,368 --> 00:33:35,311
When we establish a low orbit,
we modulate your disrupter banks

554
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,286
to bombard the compound
with tetryon particles.

555
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,731
Every directed energy weapon
would be neutralized.

556
00:33:42,766 --> 00:33:45,331
You're certain
such a thing could be done?

557
00:33:45,374 --> 00:33:47,973
Well, if Curzon were here,
you'd be out of luck

558
00:33:48,014 --> 00:33:50,043
but Jadzia Dax is
a science officer.

559
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:56,096
We would also be unable
to use our disrupters

560
00:33:56,137 --> 00:34:01,049
but who among them could match
our skills with a <i>bat'leth?</i>

561
00:34:01,084 --> 00:34:03,488
Not many.

562
00:34:03,525 --> 00:34:07,126
We're about 40 minutes
from the Secarus system.

563
00:34:07,234 --> 00:34:08,795
I think we should cloak

564
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:12,246
and then you and I, old friend,
should sharpen our blades, too.

565
00:34:14,121 --> 00:34:18,623
Perhaps...
it is a good day to live.

566
00:34:44,603 --> 00:34:47,236
You say they promised you
an honorable battle...

567
00:34:47,277 --> 00:34:50,080
hand-to-hand combat
at the main threshold.

568
00:34:50,118 --> 00:34:51,087
That's right.

569
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:52,523
Take a look at this.

570
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:56,001
This indicates a gravitic mine
buried at the main threshold.

571
00:34:56,035 --> 00:34:57,869
Yes, and he plans to detonate it

572
00:34:57,906 --> 00:34:59,843
the moment we enter
the compound.

573
00:34:59,879 --> 00:35:03,116
That's what you get for making
a deal with the devil, Kang.

574
00:35:03,155 --> 00:35:04,557
On the other hand,
this gives us

575
00:35:04,592 --> 00:35:06,426
an advantage we
wouldn't otherwise have.

576
00:35:06,464 --> 00:35:09,029
He's expecting us
at the front door.

577
00:35:09,072 --> 00:35:11,271
How do we know
that he's even inside?

578
00:35:11,378 --> 00:35:12,939
Good question.

579
00:35:14,954 --> 00:35:16,014
Wait here.

580
00:35:16,057 --> 00:35:17,584
Where are you going?

581
00:35:17,629 --> 00:35:19,863
I'm going to find out
if he's inside.

582
00:35:19,902 --> 00:35:21,736
And how do you intend
to do that?

583
00:35:21,773 --> 00:35:24,338
I'll ask somebody.

584
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:29,290
We would be wise

585
00:35:29,328 --> 00:35:32,667
to shut down his sensor array
before we attack.

586
00:35:32,704 --> 00:35:35,701
It's controlled
from this power station.

587
00:35:35,745 --> 00:35:38,651
Yes, but a power failure
would signal our presence.

588
00:35:38,688 --> 00:35:41,355
At the same time
that you shut down the sensors

589
00:35:41,395 --> 00:35:43,492
I'll create a diversion
at the armory

590
00:35:43,534 --> 00:35:45,334
to misdirect their response.

591
00:35:45,373 --> 00:35:46,342
Good strategy

592
00:35:46,376 --> 00:35:48,006
but whoever creates
a diversion

593
00:35:48,047 --> 00:35:50,519
will have to run across
this field to escape.

594
00:35:50,554 --> 00:35:51,682
With all due respect

595
00:35:51,724 --> 00:35:54,094
none of you are as
quick as you once were.

596
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,691
I'll volunteer for that job.

597
00:35:55,735 --> 00:35:57,068
Agreed.

598
00:36:18,265 --> 00:36:22,733
It seems this is
the best place for entry.

599
00:36:22,777 --> 00:36:23,871
Right here.

600
00:36:23,914 --> 00:36:27,048
I encountered
a helpful lookout.

601
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,062
The Albino is inside.

602
00:36:29,095 --> 00:36:32,069
His overconfidence will
be the death of him.

603
00:36:32,104 --> 00:36:35,774
Well, he's in there now,
but the moment we attack

604
00:36:35,813 --> 00:36:39,084
he will move to a secured
command post here.

605
00:36:39,123 --> 00:36:41,618
It will be midday
in about an hour.

606
00:36:41,663 --> 00:36:45,436
Can you create the diversion
in the armory by then?

607
00:36:45,474 --> 00:36:47,469
I think so.

608
00:36:47,546 --> 00:36:50,111
We will be in position
at the powerhouse.

609
00:36:50,154 --> 00:36:54,496
May Kahless guide us
on this day of vengeance.

610
00:37:23,012 --> 00:37:24,311
Excuse me?

611
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:26,652
Could you tell me where
the tennis courts are?

612
00:37:26,689 --> 00:37:27,851
I seem to be lost.

613
00:37:44,004 --> 00:37:45,565
Huh?

614
00:37:51,023 --> 00:37:52,049
There she is, over there.

615
00:37:52,093 --> 00:37:53,825
I'm not firing.

616
00:37:53,865 --> 00:37:54,959
What's wrong?

617
00:37:55,002 --> 00:37:56,597
I'm not firing.
I have no power.

618
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,631
Reset, reset!

619
00:38:01,386 --> 00:38:02,355
Report.

620
00:38:02,389 --> 00:38:03,551
The armory's been sabotaged.

621
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:05,756
I've diverted the forward
patrols to that area.

622
00:38:05,798 --> 00:38:06,789
Cancel those orders.

623
00:38:06,835 --> 00:38:08,932
Move all guards
to the inner defense line.

624
00:38:08,974 --> 00:38:10,877
Make sure
the power station is secure.

625
00:38:10,912 --> 00:38:11,881
Go.

626
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,214
Yes, sir.

627
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:14,916
None of the phasers
are functioning.

628
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:16,588
Not functioning?

629
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:18,029
We're running
diagnostics now.

630
00:38:18,066 --> 00:38:20,197
Use long-range sensors
to check

631
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:22,609
for interference
from a cloaked ship in orbit.

632
00:38:22,645 --> 00:38:26,919
In the meantime, have the guards
fix kuttars to their rifles

633
00:38:26,957 --> 00:38:29,624
and prepare
for hand-to-hand combat.

634
00:38:48,351 --> 00:38:50,687
I can't make contact
with the power station.

635
00:38:50,757 --> 00:38:53,697
They must have already broken
through the inner defense line.

636
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:55,828
Move the perimeter guards
into the house.

637
00:38:55,872 --> 00:38:58,344
Sir, without power,
we have no communications.

638
00:38:58,379 --> 00:39:00,874
Then get out there
and tell them yourself!

639
00:39:00,919 --> 00:39:03,950
I don't want that Klingon
filth to get in this...

640
00:39:09,342 --> 00:39:11,473
Look upon your executioners

641
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,076
killer of children.

642
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,282
Get them!

643
00:39:51,895 --> 00:39:53,456
Koloth!

644
00:40:01,154 --> 00:40:03,126
I didn't see him coming.

645
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,755
Even you cannot have eyes

646
00:40:04,798 --> 00:40:06,963
in the back of your head,
my friend.

647
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:08,702
Quiet now... rest.

648
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:10,771
I still have work to do.

649
00:40:36,085 --> 00:40:43,436
I will not die before you
do, you thunderous bulk.

650
00:40:43,472 --> 00:40:47,245
The story of your courage
will never die.

651
00:40:47,283 --> 00:40:49,916
I will sing the story.

652
00:40:49,957 --> 00:40:54,767
The children of all Klingons
will know of this day.

653
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:14,164
You'll die far quicker
than your son did, Kang.

654
00:41:48,899 --> 00:41:51,634
No vengeance today, Kang.

655
00:41:55,183 --> 00:41:56,915
And who are you, girl?

656
00:41:56,954 --> 00:41:58,857
You knew me as Curzon Dax.

657
00:41:58,893 --> 00:42:02,096
The Trill, of course.

658
00:42:02,136 --> 00:42:07,139
You're far too young and lovely
to sport such a deadly weapon.

659
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,158
All right then...

660
00:42:12,498 --> 00:42:15,940
use it, if that's
what you came to do.

661
00:42:15,975 --> 00:42:18,413
Kill me in cold blood.

662
00:42:18,448 --> 00:42:21,149
Run me through the belly

663
00:42:21,189 --> 00:42:23,023
and cut out my heart.

664
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,661
Isn't that what your
blood oath promised?

665
00:42:26,704 --> 00:42:30,613
Or have you lost your
appetite, my dear?

666
00:42:42,248 --> 00:42:47,560
Thank you for saving
the death blow for me.

667
00:42:47,596 --> 00:42:51,562
You have honored me
one last time...

668
00:42:51,608 --> 00:42:53,944
godfather to my son.

669
00:43:01,736 --> 00:43:04,710
Where is Koloth?

670
00:43:04,744 --> 00:43:07,343
He's dead.

671
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:08,946
Oh...

672
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:12,898
I was right, Dax.

673
00:43:12,934 --> 00:43:15,772
It is a good day to die.

674
00:43:19,284 --> 00:43:21,951
It's never a good day
to lose a friend.

675
00:43:28,979 --> 00:43:35,453
<i>Ki-naH-naH, lo-maytoo</i>

676
00:43:35,496 --> 00:43:43,383
<i>Ki-naH-naH, lo-maytaH...</i>
