1
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:03,337
He only paid
for one hour.

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:05,005
He's been in there for three

3
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:07,883
fighting the Battle
of Klachdachbrach

4
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:09,802
or some such thing,
over and over.

5
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:11,345
The Battle
of Klach D'kel Brakt

6
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:14,055
is a legendary Klingon victory
over the Romulans

7
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,349
almost a century ago.

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,977
Well, he's been
losing it all afternoon

9
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,270
<i>and</i> he says
he's not coming out

10
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:21,647
until he wins.

11
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,733
I banged on the door,
he sealed himself in.

12
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,068
I threatened
to shut off the power,

13
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,487
he threatened
to kill me.

14
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,697
Oh...

15
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,075
(<i> grunting, metal clanging</i> )

16
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,040
(<i> battle sounds continue</i> )

17
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:43,794
Since when did you add

18
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:45,880
ancient Klingon battles

19
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,506
to your holosuite
programs?

20
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,383
The Captain of
the last Klingon ship

21
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,050
that went through the wormhole
sold some to me.

22
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,887
Ahh...
I know, I know.

23
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:55,973
It's brutal.
It's violent.

24
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:57,516
It's bloody.

25
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:00,686
But to the Klingons,
it's entertainment.

26
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:01,770
Shut off the power.

27
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,022
He'll kill you.

28
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:05,607
No, he said
he'll kill<i> you.</i>

29
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,568
Shut it off.

30
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,784
(<i> beeping</i> )

31
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:17,578

(<i> roars</i> )

38
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:39,224
You dare interrupt
the Battle of Klach D'kel Brakt,

you Ferengi<i> k'pekt!</i>

40

41
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,356
The battle is over.

42
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:48,275
The people are
waiting to celebrate

43
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,234
your victory.

44
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,152
They are?

45
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:54,949
Lead the way, then!

46

(<i> sighs</i> )

49
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,825
How did you
get in here?

50
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,743
I am Koloth.

51
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,620
That doesn't answer
my question.

52
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,288
Yes, it does.

53
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,917
What are the
charges against him?

54
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,210
Charges? No charges.

55
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:52,006
He's today's guest of honor.

56
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:55,884
You must be a very brave man
to attempt humor

57
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:59,304
at the expense
of a Klingon<i> Dahar</i> Master.

58
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,392
I apologize.

59
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,811
No offense intended.

60
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,399

61
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,070

63
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,617
Sir...

64
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,119
if you'll wake up

65
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:24,955
I'll release you
into your friend's custody.

66
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:26,373
Oh.

67
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,251
Oh, Koloth.

68
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,545
(<i> chuckles</i> )

69
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,880
<i>wIj jup...</i>

70
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,297
my old friend.

71
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,716
Oh, I knew you'd be here.

72
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,718
You disgrace
yourself

73
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,845
and our purpose.

74
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,181
I do not go into battle

75
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:47,227
with one whose honor
is washed away in brestanti ale.

76
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,353
Keep him!

77
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,940

78
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:58,530
(<i> sighs</i> )

79
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,992
Security reassignments, Major.
Sorry it took so long.

80
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,743
It's been
a Klingon afternoon.

81
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,037
"A Klingon afternoon"?

82
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,455
Every time Klingons
visit the station,

83
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,666
I wind up with
a Klingon afternoon.

84
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,711
But this is definitely one
I'll cherish forever.

85
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,922
There's a drunken Klingon
in my holding cell,

86
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,632
must be a
hundred years old,

87
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:23,800
singing battle songs.

88
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,010
Even his best friend,

89
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,553
who's probably
150 years old,

90
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,596
won't have anything
to do with him,

91
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:29,890
so I get the pleasure

92
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,100
of listening
to his repertoire.

93
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:35,270
Kor,<i> Dahar</i> Master
of the Klingons.

94
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,771
Did you say "Kor"?

95
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,606
That's what he announced,
right after winning

96
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,151
the Battle of Klach D'kel Brakt
at Quark's.

97
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:42,986
What is he doing here?

98
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,030
Did you get his friend's name?

99
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,198
Was it Kang?

100
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,324
No, it was...

101
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,743
Koloth.

Oh, my dear

I lift my<i> ghoptu</i>

How about just
a great big hug?

137
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,614
Look at him.

138
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,243
He practices cuts and thrusts
even with his food.

139
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,953
Little children do that.

140
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,998
A sharp knife is nothing

141
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,833
without a sharp eye.

142
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,002
Ooh. Mmm, it's been 40 years

143
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,463
since even his good eye
was sharp.

144
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:09,466
Ah, it's luck
when you hit the plate.

145
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,968
I see that the Federation
insults us

146
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,595
by sending a Lieutenant
to greet us.

147
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,390
You never had much use
for the Federation

148
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,183
did you, Koloth?

149
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,726
I used to call you

150
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,396
<i>D'akturak,</i> "ice man,"
because no proposal,

151
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:25,773
no matter how reasonable,
no matter how much

152
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,026
it favored
the Klingon Empire,

153
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,278
would satisfy you.

154
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,696
You were the toughest man

155
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:35,116
I ever faced across
the negotiations table.

156
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:41,415
Do you not recognize
our old friend, Dax, hmm?

157
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,961
Dax?

158
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,629
(<i> laughing</i> )

159
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:53,885
Curzon's dead, but Dax
is alive as a part of me.

160
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,266
This is a mistake.

161
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,268
Kang must not have known.

162
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,937
Ah, but what
a beautiful mistake, hmm?

163
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,105
Is Kang coming?

164
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,940
Of course he's coming.

165
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:10,860
He's brought the four of us
back together after 81 years.

166
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,446
Could it possibly mean
that he's--

167
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,322
MAN:
Yes.

168
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:17,409
That is exactly what it means.

169
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:20,203
I have found the Albino.

170
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,829
Ah.

171
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,796
Kang, do you remember

172
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,507
the first time we sat
together over<i> bahgol?</i>

173
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,968
It was the Korvat colony.

174
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,554
The Federation
and the Klingon Empire

175
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:38,763
were still enemies.

176
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:42,934
I never sat with you
before today.

177
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,145
I am Dax,

178
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,396
godfather of your son.

179
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:49,774
You are no one's godfather.

180
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:53,194
I<i> am</i> Dax,
godfather of your son.

181
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:58,199
So, you are the same Dax
who took a blood oath with us

182
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,327
to seek vengeance?

183
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:03,663
Don't mistake a new face
for a new soul, Kang.

184
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,957
I still feel at one
with your family

185
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,001
just as I did
eight decades ago.

186
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:11,171
I hope one day you'll embrace
me as a brother again.

187
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,589
Brother, ha!

188
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:14,673
Oh, brother, sister,
what's the difference?

189
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,050
We're all here now.

190
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,219
Speak to us, Kang.
Where is he?

191
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,554
Where did you find

192
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:20,639
the Albino?

193
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:25,477
Seven years ago... on Dayos IV,

194
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,564
I met one of the Albino's
discarded wives.

195
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,942
I fed and clothed her.

196
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:36,779
I told her
the story of our sons.

197
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:41,075
She still feared him,
and told me nothing.

198
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,702
Three months ago, she died.

199
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:48,249
A week afterward, an amulet
she wore around her neck

200
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,126
was delivered to me
by messenger.

201
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:53,921
In it was the location

202
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,924
of the Albino's sanctuary.

203
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,886
Are you certain
that he's still there?

204
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:04,057
I have confirmed it
with traders who supply him.

205
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:08,019
It is on the fourth planet
of the Secarus system.

206
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,896
He has been hiding there

207
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,691
for nearly a quarter
of a century.

208
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,068
Hiding from us, no doubt.

209
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,946
I have been told he only has
40 men in his compound.

210
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,659
Evidently, he's become very lax
in his waning years.

211
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,035
(<i> Kor chuckles</i> )

212
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,579
The fool.

213
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,372
I wouldn't count
on information from traders.

214
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,207
The Albino might have
told them what to say

215
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,375
if anyone asks questions.

216
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,126
She's right.

217
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,879
The traders may already have
warned him that we are coming.

218
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:39,050
They will never
warn anyone ever again.

219
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,429
This time, we will reach
the Albino

220
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,475
and when we do, I will cut
his heart out and eat it

221
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,769
while he watches me
with his dying breath.

222
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:05,034
KANG:
I did not know, of course.

223
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,827
About Curzon?

224
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:11,458
I did not want to risk
contacting you by subspace.

225
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,667
I don't blame you.

226
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:13,752
That's how
the Albino learned

227
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,337
we were coming
to Galdonterre.

228
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,298
He has ears that reach
across the galaxy.

229
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,674
I don't know how.

230
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:24,429
Tell me about
my good friend, Curzon.

231
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,390
Did he die an
honorable death?

232
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,601
He died
in a hospital room

233
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,519
yelling at doctors
and friends

234
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,605
who were trying
to keep him alive

235
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,523
for one more
miserable day.

236
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,358
Oh, that's a pity.

237
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,193
He was a good man.

238
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,529
He deserved to die in battle.

239
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:46,284
It pains me that I will never
see him again in this life.

240
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:51,080
Curzon was decorated many times
for his diplomatic achievements,

241
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:54,292
but no honor touched him
as deeply as yours.

242
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,629
For a Klingon to choose
a Federation official

243
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,631
to be the godfather
of his son...

244
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:06,095
Curzon Dax opened
the door to peace.

245
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:09,599
He was the first Federation
diplomat I ever met

246
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:12,851
who truly seemed to understand
the Klingon nature.

247
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:16,397
Well, there was always a bit
of Klingon nature in Curzon.

248
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,733
His blood oath
with you

249
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,819
was very important to him.

250
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:27,074
Would you eat from the heart
of the Albino, Jadzia Dax?

251
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,036
I know
about the Trills

252
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:33,289
from my long friendship
with Curzon.

253
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:34,624
And I know that each new host

254
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,377
has no obligation
to past commitments.

255
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,338
And<i> I</i> know
that a Klingon blood oath

256
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,048
can never be broken.

257
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:47,303
The old Klingon ways
are passing.

258
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,724
There was a time,
when I was a young man,

259
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:55,520
the mere mention of the Klingon
Empire made worlds tremble.

260
00:14:55,562 --> 00:15:00,441
Now our warriors are opening
restaurants and serving<i> racht</i>

261
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:04,696
to the grandchildren
of men I slaughtered in battle.

262
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,323
Things are not
what they used to be,

263
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,242
not even the blood oath.

264
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,870
I know you, Kang.
You don't believe that.

265
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,998
What I believe
is no longer relevant.

266
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,835
You are released
from Curzon's oath.

267
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:21,421
You owe nothing to any of us.

268
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,634
KIRA:
Are you
still reading

269
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,428
a plasma leak
in Lower Pylon One?

270
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,970
I can't seem
to find it now.

271
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,556
It's been intermittent.

272
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,850
Let me do
a high-resolution scan.

273
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,855
Kira...
Uh-huh?

274
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,484
How many people
did you kill?

275
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,321
What?

276
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,116
While you were
in the underground.

277
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,621
Too many.

278
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,958
Were they all...
faceless Cardassians,

279
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,711
or did you know
who you were killing?

280
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,630
Why are we talking
about this?

281
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,465
If it bothers you,
we can stop.

282
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,800
It bothers me.

283
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,217
I'm sorry.

284
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:13,807
Why?

285
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:17,310
Were you thinking
about killing somebody?

286
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,019
Me?

287
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,026
Tell me.

288
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,779
I don't know what
you're talking about.

289
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,865
Tell me.

290
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:43,210
80 years ago, there was
a band of depredators

291
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:47,882
led by an Albino
raiding Klingon colonies.

292
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:51,970
Three Klingon warships
were sent to stop him.

293
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:56,975
One of the Captains was
a close friend of Curzon's.

294
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,393
The mission was successful.

295
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:04,148
Most of them were captured,
but the Albino escaped.

296
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,903
In his last message
to the Klingons,

297
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:12,532
he promised to take revenge

298
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:16,995
on the firstborn of each
of the three Captains.

299
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,664
A few years later,
he kept his word.

300
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:28,422
Somehow, he infected
three innocent children

301
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:32,218
with a genetic virus
that killed them.

302
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,472
One of them was my godson.

303
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,809
I'm sorry.

304
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,021
But, Jadzia...

305
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,523
that was Curzon's godson.

306
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:49,109
I took a blood oath
to avenge his death.

307
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,195
<i>Curzon</i> took a blood oath.

308
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,283
I can still remember
the boy's funeral.

309
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,747
He was named Dax, for me.

310
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,714
You've found
this Albino?

311
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,007
We know where he is.

312
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,718
The three Klingons
came here to tell me--

313
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,386
Look, you've
said yourself

314
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,096
every new life
for a Trill

315
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,431
has to<i> be</i> a new life.

316
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,766
If not, you'd wind up

317
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,559
paying off old
debts forever.

318
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,895
These Klingons
can't possibly expect you

319
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,479
to keep this oath.

320
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,273
No, they don't.

321
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,276
That's just it.

322
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,987
They say I have
no obligation to them.

323
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,950
But I<i> do.</i>

324
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,285
I know it, I feel it.

325
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,666
If not to them,
I owe it to Curzon.

326
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,794
Jadzia...

327
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,589
your questions
about my...

328
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,466
experience
with killing,

329
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,551
if you're wondering
what it's like...

330
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,808
When you take
someone's life,

331
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,811
you lose a part
of your own as well.

332
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,523
(<i> woman laughing</i> )

333
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,524
(<i> Kor chokes</i> )

334
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,485
I need another arm.

335
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,113
(<i> laughing</i> )

336
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,156
Or am I doomed to choose

337
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:20,159
between perfection
and the palate?

338
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,452
(<i> laughs</i> )

339
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,079
DAX:
Let me spare you
that decision.

340
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,372
(<i> slurps</i> )

341
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,333
Mmm! Mmm... mmm.

342
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,501
(<i> gulps</i> )

343
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,669
Ah...

344
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,004
(<i> coughs</i> )

345
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,463
<i>majQa'.</i>

346
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,966
To the rescue.

347
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:38,761
Dax, may I present
these two... students

348
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:42,515
of... Klingon history.

349
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,642
Would you excuse us
for a minute?

350
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,477
Hmm?

351
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,106
Ooh, well, only a minute,
my students.

352
00:19:55,528 --> 00:20:00,324
Well, you certainly don't
share Curzon's priorities.

353
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,870
About going
after the Albino, I do.

354
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,079
Kang and Koloth

355
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,289
don't want me
to come with you.

356
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,916
Well, Kang thinks too much.

357
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,836
Koloth doesn't feel enough.

358
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,838
And where do you stand?

359
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,048
Huh? Hmm?

360
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,716
Oh, of course
you should come.

361
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,052
The splendor of fighting
and killing,

362
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,720
a bloodbath in the cause
of vengeance,

363
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,680
who wouldn't want to come?

364
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,099
Would you speak
to them for me?

365
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,811
It means far more
to me than I realized.

366
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:31,438
Hmm, Koloth spends
all his time

367
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,857
practicing in the holosuite.

368
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,859
He listens to no one.

369
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:40,656
And if Kang's made up his mind,
there's nothing I can do.

370
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:44,451
And you call yourself
a history teacher?

371
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,286
What of your own history?

372
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,874
You are Kor,
<i>Dahar</i> Master.

373
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:50,917
They cheered you

374
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,044
at Klach D'kel Brakt.

375
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,796
Your voice weighed heavily on
the course of Klingon events.

376
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,135
You shame me.

377
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:04,513
No, please
don't feel that.

378
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:08,976
Huh! The only weight
I carry now, dear comrade,

379
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:12,063
is... is my own bulbous body.

380
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:16,275
I... I was once,
if you remember

381
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,444
far less than you see...

382
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,741
and far more
than I have become.

383
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,662
I'm sorry.

384
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:35,377
My memories are still
of Kor, a great warrior.

385
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,388
Quark, you...

386
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,682
devious little<i> Ha'DIBah!</i>

387
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,851
Bring wine.

388
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,895
(<i> coughs</i> )

389
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:04,240
(<i> grunts</i> )

390
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,496
(<i> grunts</i> )

391
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:26,344
(<i> grunts</i> )

392
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,222
Nice of you to stop.

393
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:31,058
I'm coming with you.

394
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,602
Curzon Dax was
a politician.

395
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:36,647
It was a diplomatic ploy
for him to bond himself

396
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,150
to us in a blood oath.

397
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,610
That's a lie.

398
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,446
Are... you...?

399
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,157
I am practicing here.

400
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,783
Leave while you can.

401
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,703
When you agree that I can
fulfill my part of the oath.

402
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:54,290
Your presence will jeopardize
the rest of us.

403
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:56,083
Leave me.

404
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:59,003
Computer, I want
a Klingon<i> bat'leth.</i>

405
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,630
Tip to tip
116 centimeters,

406
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,423
weight 5.3 kilos,

407
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:07,345
with an exterior hand-gripping
diameter of five centimeters.

408
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:10,181
Blades composite<i> baakonite.</i>

409
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:13,809
Ah, a warrior's configuration.

410
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,061
Now what are you going

411
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,187
to do with it?

412
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,191
I'm going to fight you.

413
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:25,403
And if my hand should slip
and you should die?

414
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,073
Your hand would never slip

415
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,116
unless you've become
old and feeble.

416
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,870
(<i> grunts</i> )

417
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,302
Come on, Koloth,
surely you can take me down.

418
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,186
(<i> grunting</i> )

419
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:12,076
There is tension
on your face, Koloth.

420
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,493
You ought
to drink more.

421
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,432
Stand up.

422
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:42,064
Your presence
against the Albino

423
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:45,025
will do honor
to our cause.

424
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:53,659
Well, that's a surprise
from the great stone face.

425
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,953
Releasing you
from Curzon's oath

426
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:58,205
is not enough.
I can see that now.

427
00:24:58,247 --> 00:24:59,415
It is agreed then.

428
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:00,916
KANG:
No!

429
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:04,253
I tell you now, you will not be
part of the quest.

430
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,474
(<i> Kor coughing</i> )

431
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:17,683
Why do you dismiss her

432
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:20,394
like some useless
<i>t'ooho'mIrah?</i>

433
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:23,022
We cannot go
to an enemy stronghold

434
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,815
with your sickly
chest announcing us.

435
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,192
There is nothing...

436
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,985
(<i> coughs</i> ):
nothing wrong
with my chest.

437
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,695
Nothing that won't
get us all killed

438
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,613
before we reach battle.

439
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:32,572
Come.

440
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,532
Ah, I need no nurse's hand.

441
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:55,762
You can't deny my right
for vengeance.

442
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,973
You try to speak
like a Klingon,

443
00:25:58,015 --> 00:26:00,684
but the words do not
fit in your mouth.

444
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,062
You said that to me before,
Kang, do you remember?

445
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:06,606
I do not wish to discuss it
any further.

446
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,608
The Korvat colony.

447
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,028
First day
of negotiations

448
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,654
I walked out on you

449
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:16,700
right in the middle of that
longwinded speech of yours.

450
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:19,577
You should have seen
the look on your face.

451
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,872
Nobody had ever
had the<i> kajanpak't</i>

452
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,083
to show their back
to the great Kang

453
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,418
before Curzon did.

454
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:30,047
I almost killed Curzon that day.

455
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:33,759
I knew I had to get you
very, very angry

456
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,636
or my mission wouldn't succeed.

457
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,597
Getting you angry with me
was the only way

458
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,435
to begin to create a bond
between us.

459
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:46,897
Curzon understood Klingons.

460
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,648
And he also understood
what he was doing

461
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,193
when he took
a Klingon blood oath.

462
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:53,237
You can't expect me to stay here

463
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,697
and not avenge
my own godson's murder.

464
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:59,285
You can't ask me to live
with that kind of dishonor.

465
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,203
I cannot dishonor myself

466
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:04,540
by allowing you to die
in Curzon's place.

467
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:06,250
Who's talking about dying?

468
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:09,002
I have no intention of dying.

469
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,340
You dishonor yourself
already, Kang

470
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:16,760
by placing your honor
above mine.

471
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:19,763
No Klingon warrior would
leave a comrade behind

472
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,181
while he goes off to battle.

473
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:25,227
Perhaps you're right.

474
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:28,646
Klingon honor<i> isn't</i>
what it used to be.

475
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,191
Are you trying
to anger me again?

476
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:34,528
You think the same trick
would work twice?

477
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,863
I understand Klingons.

478
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,991
All right then, it worked.

479
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,159
Come and fight with us.

480
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,035
Come and be damned.

481
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,250
(<i> door chimes</i> )

482
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:49,751
Come in.

483
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:55,132
I was just about
to come see you.

484
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:56,133
No.

485
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:59,303
No what?
No leave of absence.

486
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:01,138
Kira shouldn't have told you.

487
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,973
Kira is my First Officer.

488
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:06,226
I don't have to tell you
what this oath meant to Curzon.

489
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:09,146
Jadzia Dax took an oath, too,
when she joined Starfleet.

490
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,106
You're subject
to orders, Lieutenant.

491
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:14,193
Don't do it, Benjamin.
Don't make me disobey
a direct order.

492
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:17,863
I never understood this.

493
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:20,991
I mean, whatever
else Curzon was,

494
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,951
he did have
a fundamental morality.

495
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:25,703
He wouldn't condone murder
any more than I would.

496
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,581
And yet he swore
to kill this Albino

497
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:30,209
and now you plan to go out
and kill in his name.

498
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,002
What about the laws
of the Federation?

499
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,046
The Klingons
have their own
set of laws.

500
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,172
This<i> is</i> justice
to them.

501
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:36,549
And to you?

502
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,967
I've chosen to respect
their codes of honor

503
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,344
in this matter, yes.

504
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,804
You really think
you're capable
of doing this?

505
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:47,017
I don't know.

506
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:50,020
There's only one way
to find out, isn't there?

507
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,730
Let's say you are.

508
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:55,317
Let's say you even
survive this insanity.

509
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:59,821
You expect to come back here
and resume your duties,
as though nothing's happened?

510
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:03,450
I guess that'll
be up to you.

511
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:26,306
KANG:
The compound is made
of riddinite.

512
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:28,350
There are several walls
that separate

513
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:31,228
the main house
from the rest of the grounds.

514
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,146
The main power source
is here.

515
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,149
There is
an armory there.

516
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,484
Any information about

517
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,903
the positioning
of the sentries?

518
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:42,698
They are posted
at standing intervals

519
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,325
75 meters apart
along the perimeter.

520
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,703
Standing,
no patrols?

521
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:49,162
That's what I'm told.

522
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,914
Perhaps he thinks
we're already dead

523
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,458
and have stopped
chasing him.

524
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,585
Or perhaps he's made
his defenses look weak

525
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:56,462
for our benefit.

526
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,506
Hmm, she may be right.

527
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:01,759
We have to assume
the guards patrol the perimeter.

528
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,345
At 75 meters apart, they're out
of eye contact with each other.

529
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:07,847
He wouldn't be that stupid.

530
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,516
We must expect them to be

531
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,935
no farther than...
50 meters apart.

532
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,980
Fine, it makes no difference.

533
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,440
Doesn't it?

534
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:19,318
If we assume he has
adequate defenses,

535
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,861
a minimum of 50 guards,

536
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,030
then we should use
a<i> N'yengoren</i> strategy.

537
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,365
No!

538
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,534
I will not sneak
into his bedroom

539
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:30,078
and murder him
like a<i> kah'plakt.</i>

540
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,205
I want him
to<i> see</i> us coming.

541
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,667
I say we make
a direct attack

542
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:37,210
boldly through
the threshold.

543
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:40,547
The guards will be too scattered
to defend against us.

544
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:43,967
We will overwhelm them
to glorious victory!

545
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,595
Or a glorious death.

546
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:50,683
It is a good day to die.

547
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:55,479
It is a good day to die.

548
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,105
Come on, old comrade.

549
00:30:57,147 --> 00:31:00,900
For the last time,
let's sharpen our blades.

550
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,909
So, we talk about dying again.

551
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:14,414
A Klingon warrior
is always prepared to die.

552
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:19,169
Yes, but to invite death
with a direct assault

553
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,754
against a superior force...

554
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,175
Kang, what are you doing?

555
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:27,302
What's really going on here?

556
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,639
Loyalty blinds

557
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:33,642
Kor and Koloth, but not me.

558
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:35,394
This is not a plan for battle.

559
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,563
It's a plan
for suicide.

560
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,982
If it were someone else,

561
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:44,528
I might think you were paid
to lure us here.

562
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,738
How can you say that?

563
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,532
I took a blood oath with you.

564
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:50,659
That's why you didn't
want me to come...

565
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:53,370
because you knew
you were coming to die.

566
00:31:55,914 --> 00:32:01,461
When the amulet arrived
with the location of the Albino,

567
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:05,173
I went to the Secarus system
to see if it was true.

568
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:12,097
Somehow, the instant I arrived,
the Albino knew I was there.

569
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,558
He contacted me.

570
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:21,440
He sent an invitation...
the one last glorious battle.

571
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:26,779
He said he was tired
of this lifelong pursuit.

572
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:32,117
He swore to send 40 of his
strongest, most skilled men

573
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,411
against us in honorable battle.

574
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,248
And I agreed.

575
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,833
But why?

576
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,795
Because...

577
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:45,171
this is our last chance.

578
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:49,050
If we cannot reach
the Albino,

579
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:52,220
we can at least die
an honorable death

580
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:54,222
<i>trying</i> to reach him.

581
00:32:54,264 --> 00:33:00,896
A death a Klingon
<i>Dahar</i> Master deserves.

582
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:02,355
You know what, Kang?

583
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:05,567
I think you Klingons
embrace death too easily.

584
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:07,903
You treat death
like a lover.

585
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:12,073
I think living
is a lot more attractive.

586
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:16,286
I think an honorable victory is
better than an honorable defeat.

587
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:19,873
I know the Albino's defenses.

588
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:22,709
There is no chance
of victory here.

589
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,295
What if they had no phasers?

590
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,380
That might make the odds
a little better

591
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,882
don't you think?

592
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:31,384
How do you intend
to disarm them all?

593
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:35,388
When we establish a low orbit,
we modulate your disrupter banks

594
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,266
to bombard the compound
with tetryon particles.

595
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:39,935
Every directed
energy weapon

596
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:41,144
would be
neutralized.

597
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:45,315
You're certain
such a thing could be done?

598
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,150
Well, if Curzon were here,
you'd be out of luck,

599
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:49,528
but Jadzia Dax
is a science officer.

600
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:54,867
We would also be unable
to use our disrupters,

601
00:33:54,908 --> 00:34:01,164
but who among them could match
our skills with a<i> bat'leth?</i>

602
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:03,500
Not many.

603
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,335
We're about
40 minutes

604
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,253
from the Secarus system.

605
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,964
I think we should cloak,

606
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:11,466
and then you and I, old friend,
should sharpen our blades, too.

607
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:18,056
Perhaps...
it is a good day to live.

608
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,711
You say they promised you
an honorable battle...

609
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:50,672
hand-to-hand combat
at the main threshold.

610
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:53,050
That's right.
Take a look at this.

611
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:56,678
This indicates a gravitic mine
buried at the main threshold.

612
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,388
Yes, and he plans to detonate it

613
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,348
the moment we enter
the compound.

614
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,643
That's what you get for making
a deal with the devil, Kang.

615
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,144
On the other hand,
this gives us

616
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,939
an advantage we
wouldn't otherwise have.

617
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,608
He's expecting us
at the front door.

618
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,985
How do we know
that he's even inside?

619
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,653
Good question.

620
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,489
Wait here.

621
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,075
KOR:
Where are
you going?

622
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,410
I'm going to find out
if he's inside.

623
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,328
And how do you intend
to do that?

624
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,289
I'll ask somebody.

625
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,920
KANG:
We would be wise

626
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,880
to shut down
his sensor array

627
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,256
before we attack.

628
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:36,301
It's controlled
from this power station.

629
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:39,178
Yes, but a power failure
would signal our presence.

630
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,848
At the same time
that you shut down the sensors,

631
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,017
I'll create a diversion
at the armory

632
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,727
to misdirect
their response.

633
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:46,853
Good strategy,

634
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,521
but whoever
creates a diversion

635
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,941
will have to run across
this field to escape.

636
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,317
With all due respect,

637
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,235
none of you are as
quick as you once were.

638
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,446
I'll volunteer
for that job.

639
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:57,530
Agreed.

640
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:20,178
(<i> gasps</i> )

641
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,179
KANG:
It seems this is

642
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,473
the best place
for entry.

643
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:24,599
Right here.

644
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:27,811
I encountered
a helpful lookout.

645
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,688
The Albino<i> is</i> inside.

646
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,982
His overconfidence will
be the death of him.

647
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:33,942
Well, he's in there now,

648
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:35,234
but the moment we attack,

649
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:39,698
he will move to a secured
command post here.

650
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,283
It will be midday
in about an hour.

651
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:45,912
Can you create the diversion
in the armory by then?

652
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,246
I think so.

653
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:50,500
We will be in position
at the powerhouse.

654
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,836
May Kahless guide us

655
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,587
on this day of vengeance.

656
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,142
(<i> grunts</i> )

657
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,035
Excuse me?

658
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:27,453
Could you tell me where
the tennis courts are?

659
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,747
I seem to be lost.

660
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,970
(<i> distant shouting</i> )

661
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,097
Huh?

662
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,021
There she is,
over there.

663
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:54,522
I'm not firing.

664
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:56,191
What's wrong?
I'm not firing. I have no power.

665
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:58,443
Reset, reset!

666
00:37:58,484 --> 00:37:59,694
(<i> weapons buzzing</i> )

667
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:02,155
Report.

668
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:03,740
The armory's
been sabotaged.

669
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,909
I've diverted the forward
patrols to that area.

670
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:07,160
Cancel those orders.

671
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,121
Move all guards
to the inner defense line.

672
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:11,664
Make sure
the power station is secure.

673
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,332
Go.
Yes, sir.

674
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,210
None of the phasers
are functioning.

675
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:16,878
Not functioning?

676
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,296
We're running diagnostics now.

677
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,506
Use long-range sensors
to check

678
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,842
for interference
from a cloaked ship in orbit.

679
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:26,930
In the meantime, have the guards
fix kuttars to their rifles

680
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:29,141
and prepare
for hand-to-hand combat.

681
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:40,068
(<i> grunting</i> )

682
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,578
GUARD:
I can't make contact
with the power station.

683
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,998
They must have already broken
through the inner defense line.

684
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,125
Move the perimeter guards
into the house.

685
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,836
Sir, without power, we
have no communications.

686
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,587
Then get out there

687
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,173
and tell them yourself!

688
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:04,342
I don't want that Klingon
filth to get in this--

689
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:05,885
(<i> explosion</i> )

690
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,891
Look upon your
executioners,

00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,518
killer of children.

692
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,727
Get them!

693
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,354

(<i> groaning</i> )

696
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,484
I didn't see him coming.

697
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,153
Even you
cannot have eyes

698
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:06,988
in the back of your head,
my friend.

699
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,115
Quiet now... rest.

700
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:10,449
I still have work to do.

701
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,133
(<i> grunting and yelling</i> )

702
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:43,733
I will not die before you do,
you thunderous bulk.

703
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:47,570
The story of your courage
will never die.

704
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,282
I will sing the story.

705
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:54,535
The children of all Klingons
will know of this day.

706
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:15,307
You'll die far quicker
than your son did, Kang.

707
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:44,085
(<i> groans</i> )

708
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:47,046
(<i> panting</i> )

709
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:52,677
No vengeance today, Kang.

(<i> footsteps approaching</i> )

711
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:59,225
And who are you, girl?
You knew me as Curzon Dax.

712
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:02,270
ALBINO:
The Trill, of course.

713
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:07,150
You're far too young
and lovely to sport
such a deadly weapon.

714
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:12,864
All right then...

715
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:16,326
use it, if that's
what you came to do.

716
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:18,786
Kill me in
cold blood.

717
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:21,580
Run me through
the belly

718
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,416
and cut out my heart.

719
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:27,045
Isn't that what your
blood oath promised?

720
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:30,882
Or have you lost
your appetite, my dear?

721
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:31,883
(<i> laughing</i> )

722
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,093
(<i> groans</i> )

723
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:42,560
(<i> breathing heavily</i> )

724
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:46,772
Thank you for saving
the death blow for me.

725
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,109
You have honored me
one last time...

726
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:54,572
godfather to my son.

727
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:05,208
Where is
Koloth?

728
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,793
He's dead.

729
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,504
Oh...

730
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:13,466
I was right, Dax.

731
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:16,386
It is a good day to die.

732
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:22,559
It's never a good day
to lose a friend.
