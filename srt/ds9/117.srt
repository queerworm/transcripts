00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:05,880
SISKO:<i> Station Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46925.1.</i>

2
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:09,384
<i>We have been honored with a visit</i>
<i>by a delegation of Federation ambassadors</i>

3
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:12,011
<i>on a fact-finding mission to the wormhole.</i>

4
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:16,141
<i>Fortunately, I have just the officer</i>
<i>to take them off my hands.</i>

5
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,310
I only wish there was something
I could do, Ambassador.

6
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,271
<i>Madam </i>Ambassador.

7
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,314
Madam<i> </i>Ambassador.

8
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:27,235
But all the guest quarters on the station
are roughly the same size.

9
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:29,654
Then move me to the crew level.

10
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:32,532
All the quarters on the crew level
are currently occupied.

11
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,200
Then someone can move.

12
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,078
You, for example.

13
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,707
MALE: She did the same thing
during the voyage here.

14
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,001
She's never satisfied.

15
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,503
At least I didn't bother
the Captain every hour

16
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:49,132
with some new suggestion
on how to run his ship.

17
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,217
He welcomed my suggestions

18
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:54,846
as I'm sure your Commander Sisko
will welcome them

19
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,307
if we ever get to spend any time with him.

20
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,060
Well, Commander Sisko is extremely busy.

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,144
With what?

22
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:06,191
With... the... recalibration sweep.

23
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,984
What are you recalibrating?

24
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,611
Mmm? Everything.

25
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:14,449
Um, it's a sweeping... uh,
a recalibration of all systems.

26
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:17,619
I cannot speak for the others
but I would be fascinated

27
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,788
to observe this recalibration, Doctor.

28
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:20,830
You would?

29
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,374
Well, after your long trip

30
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,127
I thought you might enjoy
stopping by a holosuite.

31
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,837
TAXCO: Are you actually suggesting

32
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:32,509
we indulge in one of those disgusting
Ferengi sex programs?

33
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,426
No.

34
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:37,472
I... the holosuites are capable
of many different--

35
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:43,228
Of course that's what he was suggesting.
The Arbazan are so sexually repressed.

36
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,022
Why, this is outrageous.

37
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,900
Perhaps we should all just get some rest.

38
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,820
I did not come
all this way to rest, Doctor.

39
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,780
I would like to see your facility.

40
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:57,075
A first-year officer assigned
as our liaison.

41
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,786
Starfleet Command will hear of this.

42
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,372
Ambassador... Madam Ambassador

43
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,373
I'm only...

44
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:07,460
TROI: Oh, where is it?
Oh, it's gone, it's gone!

45
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,212
What's gone, Madam Ambassador?

46
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,090
-Oh, my latinum hair brooch.
-Quark!

47
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:15,969
I had just made my third straight cross.
I was leaning across the table

48
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,805
to pick up the dice again
something brushed against me

49
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:23,017
-and my God! I've been wigged.
-What's the problem, here?

50
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:26,104
Someone has stolen Ambassador
Troi's latinum hair brooch.

51
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:30,358
I'm sorry, but as the sign says,
the establishment is not responsible

52
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:33,319
-for the loss of any personal items.
-Sign? What sign?

53
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,654
The one above the door.

54
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,323
You'd have to stand on a chair
to read that.

55
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,869
House rules. I'm very sorry.
Have a nice day.

56
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,246
-( gasps )
-You are dealing

57
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,624
with the daughter of the Fifth House
Holder of the Sacred Chalice of Rixx

58
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,543
Heir to the Holy Rings of Betazed.

59
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,836
Not my ear, please!

60
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,590
Yes, and I know
where it hurts the most, you little troll.

61
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:57,760
Now, I want this room sealed
and I want everyone in it strip-searched

62
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,178
until you find my brooch.

63
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,763
ODO: May I be of service?

64
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,849
Oh, thank goodness.

65
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,268
Our Chief of Security, Odo.

66
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,769
What seems to be the problem?

67
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:11,816
Well, my brooch has been stolen.
It's been in my family for 36 generations.

68
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,402
It's absolutely priceless
and I want it back.

69
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,487
You're certain you were wearing it today?

70
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,991
Yes, of course I'm certain.
I never use this hair without it.

71
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:21,618
I see.

72
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,454
You're... Betazoid?

73
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:25,747
Of course.

74
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,708
-Telepathic?
-Yes.

75
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,086
And you sense no guilt
anywhere in this room?

76
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,047
( sighs )

77
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:44,015
No, but Betazoids cannot read Ferengis.

78
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,185
ODO: Quark has plenty
of reason to feel guilty

79
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:50,146
but he usually doesn't have to resort
to petty theft

80
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,648
to fleece his clients.

81
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,858
Thank you.

82
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,297
ODO: Wait a minute.

83
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,258
Empty your pockets now.

84
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,426
Well...

85
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,554
Since when did you join Starfleet?

86
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,892
( gasps ) That's it--that's my brooch.

87
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,644
But how did you know?

88
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:32,272
Dopterians are distant
relatives of the Ferengi.

89
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,733
It made sense that since you couldn't read
Quark you might not be able to read

90
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,318
this charming fellow either.

91
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,113
Oh, how perfectly brilliant of you.

92
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:45,493
Doctor, I want to know everything
there is to know

93
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,370
about your Security Chief.

94
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,708
{\an8}Computer, is the diagnostic
on the fusion power plant finished yet?

95
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,918
{\an8}<i>Affirmative.</i>

96
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,588
{\an8}<i>The fusion power plant</i>
<i>is operating within normal parameters.</i>

97
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,549
{\an8}What are you talking about?

98
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,553
{\an8}It's 13% below normal.

99
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:13,599
{\an8}<i>Cardassain specifications</i>
<i>accept operating efficiency within 20%.</i>

100
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:14,934
{\an8}Well, I don't.

101
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:15,977
{\an8}Anara.

102
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,395
{\an8}Yes, sir.

103
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,523
{\an8}How much do you know
about carbon reaction chambers?

104
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,942
{\an8}I've learned
a little about laser-induced fusion

105
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,277
{\an8}not much more than the basics.

106
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,279
{\an8}Ah, it's a bloody inefficient system.

107
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,073
{\an8}I'd trade it in for a Federation
model tomorrow if I could

108
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,324
{\an8}but it's all we've got.

109
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,617
{\an8}Do me a favor.

110
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,036
{\an8}Keep an eye on the exhaust
plasma temperature.

111
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:41,669
{\an8}Computer, increase deuterium flow
by five percent to reaction chamber two.

112
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,671
{\an8}<i>Procedure is not recommended.</i>

113
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,174
{\an8}Look, I've had enough
of your opinions, damn it.

114
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,258
{\an8}Just do it!

115
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,926
{\an8}<i>Procedure is not recommended.</i>

116
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:54,640
{\an8}<i>Consult Cardassian operational guidelines</i>
<i>paragraph 254-A, now on screen.</i>

117
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:59,270
{\an8}I don't want to read your tech manual.
Fine. We'll do it ourselves.

118
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,733
{\an8}Reinitializing reactor two.

119
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:10,114
Directing plasma flow
to conduits 143, 144...

120
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,241
Chief O'Brien, the power
flow from reactor two

121
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,326
has just been shut down.

122
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,243
What?

123
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,538
Computer, analyze reactor two failure.

124
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,917
<i>Reactor two was shut down</i>
<i>after sensors detected</i>

125
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,836
<i>a potential overload</i>
<i>of the carbon reaction chambers.</i>

126
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,506
That's it. That's the straw!

127
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,674
Relax, Chief. It's just a computer.

128
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,303
This is no computer. This is my archenemy.

129
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,305
You've got it working just fine,
as far I can tell.

130
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:37,058
Fine? With all due respect, Commander.

131
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,060
As an engineer,
I couldn't look at myself in the mirror

132
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:42,772
if I allowed this computer
to continue to perform as it is now.

133
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,482
I'll have to do a root canal.

134
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,441
Root canal?

135
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:48,819
It's engineering shorthand, sir.
I'll have to get into its guts.

136
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,864
-and rebuild it from the ground up.
-How long will that take?

137
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,283
Well, I'm still not that familiar
with Cardassian technology

138
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:57,787
but, oh, I guess no more
than two, three years.

139
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,332
That's going to take a lot of man-hours.
Is it really necessary?

140
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,750
You don't understand--

141
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,795
Let's just say I don't have
your sensitivity to the computer.

142
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,506
That's all right. Forget about it.

143
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,424
-Uh, Chief...
-It's all right. It doesn't matter.

144
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,219
Chief, I want you to do
what you have to do.

145
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,222
Thank you, sir. I'll get right on it.

146
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:22,436
And this is Ops.
The heart and soul of Deep Space 9.

147
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,230
Ah, there you are, Commander.

148
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,275
Gentlemen, Madam Ambassador.

149
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,319
They insisted on seeing operations, sir.

150
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,320
Of course.

151
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,408
Make yourselves at home.
I trust that Doctor Bashir

152
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,285
has been taking care of all your needs.

153
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:41,372
Well, he refuses to change
my accommodations.

154
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,623
SISKO: Accommodations?

155
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,376
Well, if I have to sleep another night

156
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,671
on a Cardassian bed
with gargoyles staring at me

157
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,172
from the wood poles...

158
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,215
KIRA: Commander.

159
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,343
An unidentified vessel
is coming through the wormhole.

160
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,512
On screen. Excuse me.

161
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,307
Uh, you'll get a better view
from over here.

162
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,318
Quite a sight isn't it?

163
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,196
That's it? That's the whole thing?

164
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:15,823
Well, yes, it is.

165
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,908
I was expecting more, somehow.

166
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:21,370
DAX: Scanners aren't picking up
any life-forms on board.

167
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,789
-A probe?
-Might be.

168
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,459
I'm reading an extensive computer array

169
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,045
but no signals to suggest
it's trying to maintain contact

170
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,212
with a mother ship.

171
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,256
Are the computers compatible with ours?

172
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,300
It's hard to tell.

173
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,345
I don't recognize any known
subprocessor patterns.

174
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,097
Obviously, the young woman
doesn't have the necessary experience.

175
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,140
Perhaps I can--

176
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:45,645
The "young woman" over there
has over 300 years experience, Ambassador.

177
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,814
DAX: I might have better luck
if we towed it into the docking ring.

178
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,942
No, not until we know
a little bit more about it.

179
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,779
Major, tow it to 500 meters
off the docking ring.

180
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:55,863
Yes, sir.

181
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,407
Mr. O'Brien, try to set up
an adaptive interface link

182
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,826
and see if we can download
any information from it.

183
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,744
Aye, sir.

184
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,875
I think it will be best
if we clear this area.

185
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,878
But this probe may represent contact
with a new species.

186
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,755
Commander, I think it would be appropriate

187
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,425
for at least one Federation ambassador
to be present at this historic occasion

188
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:20,137
and since I have a particular interest
in First Contact procedures...

189
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,098
I appreciate your interest, Ambassador

190
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:25,267
and to keep you all informed,
I'm scheduling a briefing

191
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:29,939
at 0400. In the meantime, Dr. Bashir
the best place to view this probe

192
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,149
is from the docking ring near Port Seven.

193
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,944
I'll show them the way.

194
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,372
( sighs )

195
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,970
Such concentration.

196
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,473
Such intensity, such passion
for your work.

197
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,685
Tracking intergalactic malefactors.

198
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,689
Most people find it rather tedious.

199
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,358
Tedious? ( chuckling )

200
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:18,237
No, those of us who have been
beneficiaries of your heroism

201
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,406
would never call your work tedious.

202
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,867
We've learned that, on this station

203
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:27,246
you are the thin, beige line
between order and chaos.

204
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,707
That's my job.

205
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:35,504
Now, what can I do for you?
You haven't lost anything else, I hope.

206
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,590
Only my heart.

207
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:39,967
I beg your pardon?

208
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,219
Is, um...

209
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,514
Is Odo your first or last name?

210
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:47,516
Yes.

211
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:50,644
Oh. Then I can just call you, uh?

212
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:51,812
Odo.

213
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,399
It has a certain lyrical quality.

214
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:57,818
Lyrical?

215
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,361
Odo...

216
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,864
It rolls off the tongue.

217
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:03,991
Uh...

218
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,203
I have a lot of work to do.

219
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,914
I understand you're a shape-shifter.

220
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,540
That's correct.

221
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,292
I've never been with a shape-shifter.

222
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,295
"Been with?"

223
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,673
I've heard
that you're the only one of your kind.

224
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:22,718
So far.

225
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,639
Mmm. All the men I've known

226
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:30,184
have needed to be shaped,
and molded, and manipulated

227
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,685
and finally I've met a man

228
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,146
who knows how to do it himself.

229
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:36,732
Oh...

230
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:41,445
( groaning ) Is that the com?
I think it is. Excuse me.

231
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,738
I've got to get to Ops.

232
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:05,010
COMPUTER:<i> Initiating high-resolution scan.</i>
<i>Memory nodes located.</i>

233
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,346
<i>Proceeding with data transfer.</i>

234
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,641
Yeah, there you go.
Who would have thought?

235
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,101
You seem surprised, Chief.

236
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,061
Well, knowing this computer,

237
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,522
I thought I would have had to reconfigure
the whole emulator module

238
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:20,568
to make it compatible with the probe
but it's cooperating for once.

239
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,280
<i>Transfer of data is complete.</i>

240
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,407
Well done, computer.

241
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:31,120
Computer, run standard code translations
on probe data.

242
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,454
Isolate syntax results.

243
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,123
<i>Processing.</i>

244
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:35,499
<i>Stand by.</i>

245
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,505
Come in. Yes, Odo.

246
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,299
Commander...

247
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,135
-I have a problem.
-Quark again?

248
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,179
No, sir. This one is named Lwaxana.

249
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,223
Lwaxana Troi, the ambassador?

250
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,558
That's her.

251
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:57,980
There was a minor incident at the bar
that I helped her with, and now she's...

252
00:14:58,939 --> 00:14:59,857
Grateful.

253
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,942
What's the problem?

254
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:05,905
The manner in which
she expresses her... gratitude.

255
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,741
To be honest, Commander, she seems...

256
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,410
Interested in me.

257
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,955
What's wrong with that?

258
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,417
She's extremely aggressive.

259
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,170
I see. So she's after you.

260
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,256
Like a Wanoni tracehound.

261
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,425
Have you thought of letting her catch you?

262
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,469
Sir?

263
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,763
A little romance, Odo.

264
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:35,142
I have six pylons that need a complete
security sweep.

265
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:38,312
I don't have time for romantic interludes.

266
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,027
Frankly, in my humble opinion,
most of you humanoids

267
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,365
spend far too much time
on your respective mating rituals.

268
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,117
It does help the procreation
of one's species.

269
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,497
Procreation does not require
changing how you smell

270
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,668
or writing bad poetry,
or sacrificing various plants

271
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,337
to serve as tokens of affection.

272
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,299
In any event,
it's all irrelevant to me.

273
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,218
I'm sorry to hear that.

274
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,222
I would appreciate it if you would do
something about this woman.

275
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,306
Me?

276
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:17,017
Just tell her to leave me alone.

277
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:21,480
Constable, you can handle thieves
and killers, but not one Betazoid woman?

278
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:26,652
I understand thieves and killers.
I don't understand... her.

279
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,821
I can't help you, Odo.

280
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:32,074
I'm just trying to avoid
a diplomatic incident.

281
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,826
I don't want to insult the Ambassador.

282
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,536
SISKO: A reasonable concern.

283
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:39,123
I suggest you handle the matter
with great delicacy.

284
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,298
I don't handle "delicacy" very well.

285
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,597
The probe appears to be made out
of some sort of corundium alloy.

286
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:59,768
COMPUTER: <i>Analysis of all subprocessor</i>
<i>modules is complete.</i>

287
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:01,729
Already?

288
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,564
On screen.

289
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,400
Lieutenant?

290
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:14,324
No science modules
no communications system

291
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,287
and enough computer capacity to run
a Galaxy-class starship.

292
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,538
It's very odd.

293
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,167
That's an awful lot of computer hardware
simply to navigate a probe.

294
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,543
Anything?

295
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,046
Nothing to suggest the probe's mission...

296
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,757
Or any hint of its origin.

297
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,975
Ah! There you are, Odo!

298
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:44,354
( laughs ) Have you ever been
on the fourth moon of Andevian II at dawn?

299
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,981
Can't say I have.

300
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,485
I have the most wonderful holoprogram.
And I've reserved a suite for us

301
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,736
with that Quark person.

302
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,031
You told Quark that you
were going into a holosuite with me?

303
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:54,948
Well, of course.

304
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,117
He's preparing a special
picnic basket for us.

305
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,202
Good Lord.

306
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,995
I'm afraid I'm not available.

307
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,414
I have to get
to Upper Pylon 3 immediately.

308
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,415
Madam Ambassador...

309
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,541
Oh, Lwaxana.

310
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,628
Um... Upper Pylon 3.

311
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,005
I've always wanted to see an upper pylon.

312
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:16,970
I know, I'll have Quark
send one of his minions with our basket.

313
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,388
We'll have our picnic up there.

314
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,556
Madam Ambassador...

315
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,475
Oh, Lwaxana.

316
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:25,521
I don't eat. This is not a real mouth.

317
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:30,317
It is an approximation of one.
I do not have an esophagus or a stomach

318
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,278
or a digestive system. I am not like you.

319
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:38,242
Every 16 hours, I turn into a liquid.

320
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,369
I can swim.

321
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,495
Oh!

322
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,667
Computer?

323
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:48,877
Computer!

324
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,464
Odo to Ops.

325
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,633
Go ahead, Odo.

326
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,427
<i>Ambassador Troi and I are stuck </i>
<i>in Turbolift 7.</i>

327
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,304
<i>-What's going on? </i>
-Power to the pylon

328
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,848
turbolifts has failed.

329
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:09,731
We're reading a turbolift failure, Odo.
We'll beam you out.

330
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,234
Locking on. Prepare to transport.

331
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,277
ODO: <i>Ready.</i>

332
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,778
Energizing.

333
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:21,952
Well?

334
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,371
KIRA: <i>Looks like the transporter </i>
<i>is down, too.</i>

335
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,789
<i>But don't worry, Constable.</i>

336
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,499
<i>We'll get it repaired right away.</i>

337
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,670
Dax to Chief O'Brien.
Please report to Ops immediately.

338
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,172
Be patient, Odo.

339
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,340
<i>We'll get you out of there</i>
<i>as soon as we can.</i>

340
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,304
Well, alone at last.

I don't get it.

Every component of the turbolift power net
seems to be operational.

346
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,960
We can't find anything wrong
with the transporter.

347
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,547
Great, everything's in working order
except nothing's working.

348
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,217
How do we get our people
out of the turbolift, Chief?

349
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,719
Well, if we were on a starship,
I'd reroute the EPS power flow

350
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,596
in a couple of hours,
but with this computer

351
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:23,931
there's no telling how long it'll take.

352
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:24,848
Get it started.

353
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:28,769
Kira to Odo.

354
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:29,937
<i>Yes, Major?</i>

355
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,648
I'm sorry, but you're going
to have to stay put for a while longer.

356
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,233
Define "a while."

357
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,652
I wish I knew.

358
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,864
<i>By the way, Cardassian turbolifts</i>

359
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,950
<i>run exposed, multi-phased</i>
<i>alternating currents</i>

360
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,368
<i>through their positioning mechanisms</i>

361
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,662
<i>so don't try to shape-shift your way out.</i>

362
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,248
I wouldn't think of it.

363
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,210
Besides, it wouldn't be polite.

364
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,920
<i>I didn't hear that.</i>

365
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,423
I--It wouldn't be polite.

366
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,301
<i>Understood. Kira out.</i>

367
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,763
( sighs )

368
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:09,226
Do you suppose that we're, uh...
we're actually in any danger?

369
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,645
Not if we remain calm.

370
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,854
Ah.

371
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:17,025
Well, then we might as well
enjoy ourselves.

372
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,696
Uh, we can take the opportunity
to get to know each other.

373
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,909
I'd really prefer
to pass the time quietly.

374
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,744
-Quietly.
-Quietly.

375
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:28,996
-Of course.
-Thank you.

376
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:29,913
Mmm.

377
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,379
( sighs )

378
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,548
The quiet man.

379
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:40,757
Hmm.

380
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,845
You know,
I've always been attracted to quiet men.

381
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,722
Odd, isn't it?

382
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:51,685
But maybe there's more truth than
we realize to that old axiom that op--

383
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:55,439
Quietly.

384
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:07,659
Odo.

385
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,704
Yes?

386
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,831
I don't think I can.

387
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,419
Can what?

388
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:22,174
Well, you don't have to say another word
as long as we're here

389
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:25,844
but I, I think I really need to talk.

390
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,554
( groans )

391
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,600
I understand.

392
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,899
There's nothing to be afraid of.

393
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,525
Of course not.

394
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,445
No, things could be much worse.

395
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:44,863
Really?

396
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,490
( sighs )

397
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,575
My daughter and I were once trapped

398
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,203
aboard a Ferengi cargo ship,
and it was dreadful.

399
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:54,790
Well, all right,
it wasn't actually dreadful.

400
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,541
It was mildly lamentable

401
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:00,128
and it was all because
of that loathsome DaiMon.

402
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:01,213
Well...

403
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:04,091
Actually, he wasn't altogether loathsome.

404
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,384
He was just slightly repulsive.

405
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:13,600
But he did have a certain charm
in an insufferable kind of way.

406
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:19,189
Of course, he was totally at the mercy
of his uncontrollable passion for me

407
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:22,651
which means he wasn't all bad,
now, doesn't it?

408
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,862
And you know, it wasn't all passion, no.

409
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:29,699
There was some negligible
commercial interest involved

410
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:35,330
but, oh, the passion
oh, that was... that was perfectly real

411
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:38,500
and kind of, um, kind of sweet in a way.

412
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,044
He was so helpless.

413
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,756
At first, it was totally
a question of expediency

414
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,925
when I made love with--with him.

415
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,802
What are you looking at?

416
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,595
Hmm?

417
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:51,805
Hmm?

418
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:52,722
Oh.

419
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:53,932
Uh, nothing.

420
00:23:54,850 --> 00:24:00,355
I was just wondering how many volts
are in that exposed circuit.

421
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,023
Go on. Go on.

422
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:06,278
Well... frankly
by the time one thing led to another...

423
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:12,075
Think of it as an opportunity, Doctor.
You never know when a friendly ambassador

424
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,203
is going to be in the right place
at the right time to help your career.

425
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,498
Another hour with them
could destroy my career.

426
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:22,377
It's a simple job.
Just keep them happy and away from me.

427
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,295
Simple?

428
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,422
Nothing makes them happy.

429
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,216
They are dedicated to being unhappy

430
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,510
and to spreading that unhappiness
wherever they go.

431
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,430
They are the Ambassadors of Unhappy.

432
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,973
( laughing )

433
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,808
All of us have
had these assignments, Doctor.

434
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:37,809
Have you, sir?

435
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,104
As a matter of fact
Curzon Dax used to take perverse pleasure

436
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,064
in assigning me to take care
of VIP guests.

437
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,401
Oh, so now you take the same
perverse pleasure.

438
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:47,819
In doing it to me.

439
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,279
Exactly.

440
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,031
May I ask, sir

441
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:54,451
when you graduated
from this sort of assignment?

442
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:59,289
The day I hit one of the guests.

443
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,750
Hit one...

444
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:05,629
It was a simple misunderstanding
over his attempt to coax a young Ensign

445
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,923
to his quarters against her will.

446
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:10,717
But...

447
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,846
Don't hit one of them, Doctor.

448
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,474
I'm not nearly as understanding
as Curzon was.

449
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,142
Yes, sir.

450
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,729
O'Brien: Commander, can I talk to you?

451
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,110
-It's about the computer, sir.
-Still giving you problems?

452
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,196
No, sir, that's just the thing, it's not.

453
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,782
It rerouted the EPS power flow
in less than an hour.

454
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,075
That's good news.

455
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:37,285
How soon can we get Odo
and the Ambassador out?

456
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,330
We can't.
It didn't activate the turbolift circuits.

457
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,831
Don't ask me why.

458
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,750
You must have some idea of what's wrong.

459
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:45,961
I want you to listen to something.

460
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:51,758
Computer, analyze Ops 0-2 sensor readings.

461
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:58,056
COMPUTER: <i>All sensors read between 14.3 </i>
<i>and 14.4 KSC.</i>

462
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:06,439
Computer, restart all shield
generator subsystems.

463
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,734
<i>Shield generator subsystems</i>
<i>set to active status.</i>

464
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,779
<i>Reading 98.3% efficiency.</i>

465
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,364
( whispering ) Do you hear it?

466
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,076
( whispering ) Hear what?

467
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,662
The voice, it's not the same attitude.

468
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,455
It sounds like the computer.

469
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,333
Sir, when you work
with a computer as much as I do

470
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,253
you get to know it.
They're all very different.

471
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:31,423
Working with the<i> Enterprise </i>computer
was like dancing a waltz.

472
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:34,384
With this computer, it's always
been like a wrestling match

473
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,344
till we started downloading the probe.

474
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,638
You think some kind of program
from the probe

475
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,348
is influencing our computer?

476
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,642
Well, it's got to be more
than just a program, sir.

477
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,729
The computer's whole personality
has changed.

478
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,148
It's not resisting any commands

479
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:51,026
offering any opinions,
giving any arguments

480
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,072
and there's this one other crazy thing
I'm almost afraid to mention.

481
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,157
What's that?

482
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:01,077
Every time I leave
something happens to bring me back.

483
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,162
Bring you back?

484
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:07,250
To the computer like the failures
to the turbolifts and the transporters.

485
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,419
A few minutes ago, I was working
at the transporter pad

486
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:13,798
and the com lines went down
and when I broke for a quick bite to eat

487
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,383
we had a replicator failure.

488
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:19,304
It's almost like the computer
doesn't want me to leave it alone.

489
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,182
You almost make it sound like a child.

490
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,152
SISKO:<i> Station Log, supplemental.</i>

491
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,739
<i>Odo and Ambassador Troi</i>
<i>remain trapped in Turbolift 4.</i>

492
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,742
<i>As of yet, we have been unable</i>
<i>to ascertain what it is</i>

493
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,745
<i>that's causing the station's computer </i>
<i>to malfunction.</i>

494
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:47,248
What if it's some kind
of non biological life-form

495
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,541
we've never seen before?

496
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,834
Nonbiological?

497
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:53,463
Well, it all comes down
to how we define life-form.

498
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:57,217
But just as biological organisms
have evolved in our cultures

499
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,886
mechanical life could
have done the same in others.

500
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,556
You're suggesting someone
left a baby at our doorstep.

501
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,016
Possibly.

502
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,935
Do you think we can communicate with it?

503
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,728
Well, in a way, we already have.

504
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:11,147
I mean, it's part and parcel
of our computer now.

505
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,691
But as far as direct communication
is concerned

506
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,276
it may not be capable of that.

507
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,654
We haven't seen any evidence
that this entity is sentient.

508
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:21,366
KIRA: Maybe more like a stray puppy
that's attached itself to you, Chief.

509
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,618
Whatever it is, it's slowly
disabling our station.

510
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:25,995
People, we've got to get it out of there.

511
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,624
It came here when we downloaded
the probe's files.

512
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:34,087
If we upload those same files back
to the probe it might go with them.

513
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,673
What if it's fully integrated
itself into our computer?

514
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:40,301
I don't think it has.
That would make it more like a virus.

515
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,430
But I don't see any evidence
that it's trying to overwrite

516
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,640
our control networks or destroy
our systems.

517
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,768
I think it's more likely that it simply
creates connections

518
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,520
with areas of the computer
that are active.

519
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,815
Almost as though it feeds off the energy
of the computer functions.

520
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:56,776
If I'm right, transferring
all of its programming

521
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,279
off the station might just solve
our problems.

522
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:07,120
How long since we had any communication
from Odo?

523
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:11,332
Com lines have been down over 90 minutes.
He's been in there almost four hours now.

524
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,587
Do you happen to know the schedule
of his regenerative cycle?

525
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,464
My God, I have no idea

526
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,134
but if he doesn't get back
to his pail in time...

527
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:34,147
COMPUTER:<i> Subspace emitter aligned.</i>
<i>Outgoing data stream activated.</i>

528
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:37,776
Computer, upload
all probe command sequences

529
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,527
back to probe's computer.

530
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,154
Stand by.

531
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:45,825
<i>Unable to complete requested function.</i>
<i>Please abort and retry.</i>

532
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,828
Reset subspace emitter.

533
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,915
Reinitialize data stream.

534
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:56,127
<i>Receptors open. Control relays activated.</i>

535
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:02,342
Upload all probe command sequences
back to probe's computers.

536
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,010
<i>Stand by.</i>

537
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,060
It's not as easy as I thought
it would be, Commander.

538
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:19,901
Is it just the lights or the heat, too?
I didn't bring any warm clothes.

539
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,028
I'm sure it's just temporary.

540
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:26,533
I've been reading the reports
of your Chief of Operations, Doctor.

541
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:30,370
They gave me the impression
that he was a competent engineer.

542
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:33,331
Chief O'Brien?
One of the best in Starfleet.

543
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,667
Then why aren't the backup
systems functioning?

544
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,293
Well, you know...

545
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:42,215
Out here on the edge of the frontier
it's just one adventure after another.

546
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,552
Why don't I escort you all back
to your quarters,

547
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:49,305
where I'm sure
we can all wait this one out.

548
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,609
But enough about me.

549
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,237
Hmm?

550
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:07,365
Enough about me. Tell me about yourself.

551
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,078
I'm really a private man.

552
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,206
Yes, of course you are.

553
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,295
Is that hair real?

554
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,592
It is real in that it is me.

555
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,303
It is not real hair.

556
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:30,889
How did you do it?

557
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,390
Your hair.

558
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,352
It took a great deal of practice.

559
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,147
You studied hairstyles?

560
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,149
( sighs )

561
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:46,195
If you must know I imitated the hairstyle

562
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,656
of the Bajoran man who was assigned to me.

563
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:50,783
Assigned?

564
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:57,123
To study me at the research center.
He was a scientist.

565
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:02,629
You mean that's how you grew up
in a laboratory?

566
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:07,425
I did not grow up as you think of it.

567
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,137
It was merely a transition
from what I used to be...

568
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,557
To what I learned to become.

569
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:16,809
Oh...

570
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,147
It sounds very lonely to me.

571
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,819
I was always very self-sufficient.

572
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:32,909
I'm sure you had to be...
uh, to survive...

573
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:36,037
Being... being so different
from everyone else.

574
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,542
Odo to Ops.

575
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,336
Odo to Ops.

576
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,797
Com lines are still down.

577
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,591
I don't know what's taking so long.

578
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:51,260
Are you sure you're all right?
You look warm.

579
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,428
It's nothing. I'm fine.

580
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,185
Oh, I can't imagine how it must have been.

581
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,022
You know, if it bothers you
to talk about this...

582
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:03,940
Not at all.

583
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,860
What was it like?

584
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:11,572
I guess you could say
I was the life of the party.

585
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,492
I don't think I understand.

586
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,911
My way of trying to fit in.

587
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,039
I found I could be entertaining.

588
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:24,335
"Odo, be a chair." I'm a chair.
"Odo, be a razorcat." I'm a razorcat.

589
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,962
Life of the party.

590
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,130
( chuckles )

591
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,049
I hate parties.

592
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:35,013
Well, perhaps you've been going
to the wrong ones.

593
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,558
Come to one of mine, Odo.

594
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:42,645
I'll make sure that all the guests
are there to entertain you.

595
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,026
( groans )

596
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,319
Now, now, you're not well.

597
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,697
No, it's fine. It's just, uh...

598
00:33:56,951 --> 00:34:00,663
I told you I turn into a liquid
every 16 hours.

599
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,752
Well, I'm in hour 15.

600
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,679
Ready, Commander.

601
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,598
How long do you expect it to take?

602
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:19,557
Well, if it works

603
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,350
we ought to be able
to get all the probe's files

604
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,728
manually transferred
to the six isolinear rods

605
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,063
in less than 60 seconds.

606
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,064
Let's do it.

607
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:31,652
Computer, run a level-1 diagnostic
of all power systems on board.

608
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,405
<i>Requested function </i>
<i>will require 43 minutes.</i>

609
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,406
Stand by.

610
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:40,244
SISKO: Computer, give me an analysis

611
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,455
of all Cardassian traffic
along the border.

612
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:45,958
<i>Processing long-range sensors. Stand by.</i>

613
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,505
DAX: Computer create
a historical data base

614
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,256
for all known wormhole activity.

615
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,176
( stuttering )<i> Indicate time parameters.</i>

616
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,844
DAX: All known occurrences.

617
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:01,808
( slowly )<i> Requested function</i>
<i>will require subspace link-up.</i>

618
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:06,312
DAX: In that case, create a subspace
link with Nehru Colony,

619
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:10,483
New France Colony,
and Corado I Transmitter Array.

620
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:16,239
( stuttering )<i> Attempting link-up. </i>
<i>Stand by...</i>

621
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:21,077
Computer, access musical files
in the Bajor Master Data Banks

622
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,704
and create a concert program
of Bajoran serenas.

623
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:27,416
<i>Stand... by...</i>

624
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,087
( fading )<i> Unable to...</i>

625
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,172
<i>Stand...</i>

626
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:39,220
I'm reading a huge plasma surge
in the Habitat Ring.

627
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,098
You tell Commander Sisko that I expect
that probe briefing

628
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,101
to be held on schedule,
lights or no lights.

629
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,270
I will surely pass that on, Ambassador--

630
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,652
We've got a plasma explosion
in corridor H-12-A, guest quarters.

631
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:55,945
The computer's not responding.

632
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:58,156
None of the fire suppression
systems are coming on line.

633
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,907
I'm reading four life-forms
in that corridor.

634
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,535
Major, you're with me. Chief,
get an emergency crew down there.

635
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,579
-We'll need manual fire gear.
-Aye, sir.

636
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,747
( coughing )

637
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:25,183
( coughing )

638
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,993
SISKO: Phasers at maximum.

639
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:52,335
Toranium inlay, Cardassian design
I should have guessed.

640
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,712
We're going to need a bipolar
torch to get through it.

641
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,047
Then get a message to Ops.

642
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,174
Tell them it's going to take us
a while to get inside.

643
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:00,343
If they can't get the fire
suppression systems on line

644
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,719
we're going to lose our people in there.

645
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:02,720
Aye, sir.

646
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:07,225
It's not paying any attention to me.

647
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:12,104
I guess it just doesn't want to leave
like a scared puppy.

648
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:17,443
We have no idea how long that probe
was tumbling through space, maybe years,

649
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,737
with that life-form alone on board.

650
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,823
It's sort of like shutting up
a puppy in a room, you know?

651
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,369
I had a pup once. If I had to lock him up

652
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,955
he'd scratch forever
at the door trying to get out.

653
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,165
I'm not sure I know
what you're getting at.

654
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:34,835
Pups don't like to be left alone.
They like attention.

655
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,505
This one is certainly getting a lot of it.

656
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:38,881
That's right.

657
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,884
So it's no wonder
it doesn't want to leave.

658
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,762
OK, but how is that going to help us?

659
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,264
Everything we've seen suggests

660
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,641
that this entity likes
to be where the action is.

661
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,270
It seems to feed off the energy
of an active computer.

662
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:55,314
We've been trying to separate it
from what it thrives on.

663
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,067
We've got to do the exact opposite.

664
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,694
The exact opposite?

665
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:03,197
Lieutenant, I've got to build a doghouse.

666
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:08,411
( labored breathing )

667
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,252
Odo to Ops.

668
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:18,462
( moaning )

669
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:22,967
Odo out.

670
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,344
Odo, turn around.

671
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:29,140
I can't. It's beginning.

672
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,350
It's all right.

673
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:33,894
You don't understand.

674
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,606
No one has ever seen me like this before.

675
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,569
Not even the scientist
who was assigned to you?

676
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:43,029
That was different.

677
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,906
It was only research to him.

678
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,952
But you don't have to be ashamed with me.

679
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,038
I'm not ashamed.

680
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,916
It's a private matter, that's all.

681
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,671
How can I make it easier for you?

682
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,090
You can't.

683
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:04,592
I'm fine.

684
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,393
What's that?

685
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:16,312
My hair.

686
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,657
No one's ever seen me like this.

687
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,118
Why?

688
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,121
It looks fine.

689
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,666
It looks ordinary.

690
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,461
I've never cared to be ordinary.

691
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,716
So you see, Odo,
even we non-shape-shifters

692
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,927
have to change who we are once in a while.

693
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:54,016
You are not at all what I expected.

694
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,439
No one's ever paid me
a greater compliment.

695
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:13,661
I... cannot hold my shape any longer.

696
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,040
Let go.

697
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,086
I'll take care of you.

698
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,422
( moaning )

699
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:35,266
KIRA: We're going to need portable
oxygen and get anything

700
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:38,477
Bashir has in stock to treat plasma burns.
Have a runabout ready

701
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,271
to evacuate these people
to Bajor if we need to.

702
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,188
Yes, sir.

703
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,401
Anara?

704
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,778
The subprogram is ready, Chief.

705
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:52,408
Computer, analyze subprogram
labeled "Pup."

706
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:57,079
<i>Requested subprogram is a series</i>
<i>of bi-directional data transfer</i>

707
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,664
<i>and monitoring commands.</i>

708
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:03,043
Reroute all main computer backup functions
through this subprogram.

709
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,130
<i>All backup functions rerouted.</i>

710
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:07,548
Great.

711
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,801
OK, computer. Now, listen carefully.

712
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:14,513
I want to transfer
all probe command sequences

713
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,683
out of core memory
and into the subprogram Pup.

714
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,310
<i>Stand by.</i>

715
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,063
<i>Transfer complete.</i>

716
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:28,110
<i>Dax to Sisko.</i>
<i>Fire suppression is responding.</i>

717
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,529
<i>All systems are back on line.</i>
<i>Can you get in?</i>

718
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,368
We're in, Dax. Stand by.

719
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:41,415
( electrical hissing and popping )

720
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,267
We'd better advise Starfleet Command.

721
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:02,269
( rattling )

722
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,650
Are you all right?

723
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,902
BASHIR: Here, take my hand,
Madam Ambassador.

724
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,404
Watch your head.

725
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,407
Please, Julian.

726
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,326
Call me Taxco.

727
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,454
Ambassador, are you all right?

728
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,748
Yes. Thanks to Julian.

729
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:30,089
The Doctor
was remarkably calm and logical,

730
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:33,801
for a man of his years,
under such severe conditions.

731
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:36,095
We'll be putting him
in for a commendation.

732
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,351
Nice work, Dr. Bashir.

733
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,938
Just in the right place
at the right time, sir.

734
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,489
Well, it's about time.

735
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:03,414
I... know that wasn't exactly
what you had in mind

736
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:04,540
for your picnic.

737
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:09,920
When it comes to picnics
the only thing that really matters

738
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,297
is the company.

739
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:16,385
Your sensitivity and discretion
are appreciated.

740
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:18,971
Well...

741
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:24,393
Next time you see me I'll give you
a lot more to appreciate.

742
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,658
How did you beat that thing
in the computer, Chief?

743
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:42,536
-I didn't.
-He adopted it.

744
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,454
Adopted it?

745
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,830
Well, I was able to get our friend

746
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:47,291
out of the main command pathways
and into a subprogram.

747
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:50,294
-You're suggesting we leave it in there?
-I don't see why not.

748
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:53,172
It's happy. It's not bothering us anymore.

749
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,049
Well, it seems the humane thing to do.

750
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:58,427
It's just another
new life-form visiting the station.

751
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:02,014
I'll take care of it. Make sure
it gets enough attention and all.

752
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,808
Keep it off the furniture.

753
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:05,726
Yes, sir.
