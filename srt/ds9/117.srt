1
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,971
Station Log, Stardate 46925.1.

2
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:08,706
We have been honored
with a visit

3
00:00:08,747 --> 00:00:10,513
by a delegation
of Federation ambassadors

4
00:00:10,551 --> 00:00:13,115
on a fact-finding mission
to the wormhole.

5
00:00:13,158 --> 00:00:15,630
Fortunately,
I have just the officer

6
00:00:15,664 --> 00:00:17,532
to take them off my hands.

7
00:00:17,569 --> 00:00:20,941
I only wish there was something
I could do, Ambassador.

8
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,643
Madam Ambassador.

9
00:00:22,682 --> 00:00:24,015
Madam Ambassador.

10
00:00:24,052 --> 00:00:26,581
But all the guest
quarters on the station

11
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,530
are roughly the same size.

12
00:00:28,565 --> 00:00:30,901
Then move me to the crew level.

13
00:00:30,937 --> 00:00:32,703
All the quarters
on the crew level

14
00:00:32,742 --> 00:00:34,006
are currently occupied.

15
00:00:34,045 --> 00:00:35,743
Then someone can move.

16
00:00:36,753 --> 00:00:38,245
You, for example.

17
00:00:38,323 --> 00:00:41,992
She did the same thing
during the voyage here.

18
00:00:42,033 --> 00:00:43,628
She's never satisfied.

19
00:00:43,671 --> 00:00:46,941
At least I didn't bother
the Captain every hour

20
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:50,512
with some new suggestion
on how to run his ship.

21
00:00:50,555 --> 00:00:52,219
He welcomed my suggestions

22
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:55,631
as I'm sure your Commander Sisko
will welcome them

23
00:00:55,668 --> 00:00:59,040
if we ever get
to spend any time with him.

24
00:00:59,077 --> 00:01:01,311
Well, Commander Sisko
is extremely busy.

25
00:01:01,383 --> 00:01:02,784
With what?

26
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,663
With... the...
recalibration sweep.

27
00:01:07,699 --> 00:01:09,465
What are you recalibrating?

28
00:01:09,504 --> 00:01:10,803
Mmm? Everything.

29
00:01:10,841 --> 00:01:12,276
Um, it's a sweeping...

30
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:14,851
uh, a recalibration
of all systems.

31
00:01:14,885 --> 00:01:18,759
I cannot speak for the others,
but I would be fascinated

32
00:01:18,795 --> 00:01:21,165
to observe this recalibration,
Doctor.

33
00:01:21,201 --> 00:01:22,295
You would?

34
00:01:22,338 --> 00:01:23,898
Well, after your long trip

35
00:01:23,942 --> 00:01:27,110
I thought you might enjoy
stopping by a holosuite.

36
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,212
Are you actually suggesting

37
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:32,959
we indulge in one of those
disgusting Ferengi sex programs?

38
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:35,163
No.

39
00:01:35,204 --> 00:01:38,337
I... the holosuites are capable
of many different...

40
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:39,881
Of course

41
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:41,477
that's what he was suggesting.

42
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,585
The Arbazan
are so sexually repressed.

43
00:01:44,629 --> 00:01:47,660
Why, this is outrageous.

44
00:01:47,703 --> 00:01:50,107
Perhaps we should all
just get some rest.

45
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:53,276
I did not come all this way
to rest, Doctor.

46
00:01:53,318 --> 00:01:55,346
I would like to see
your facility.

47
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,523
A first-year officer
assigned as our liaison.

48
00:01:58,564 --> 00:02:01,402
Starfleet Command
will hear of this.

49
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,467
Ambassador...
Madam Ambassador

50
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:04,673
I'm only...

51
00:02:04,714 --> 00:02:06,344
Oh, where is it?!

52
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:08,549
Oh, it's gone, it's gone!

53
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,618
What's gone, Madam Ambassador?

54
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,361
Oh, my latinum hairbrooch.

55
00:02:12,401 --> 00:02:13,529
Quark!

56
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,270
I had just made
my third straight cross.

57
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:18,510
I was leaning across the table
to pick up the dice again

58
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,316
something brushed against me

59
00:02:20,354 --> 00:02:21,323
and my God!

60
00:02:21,357 --> 00:02:22,621
I've been wigged.

61
00:02:22,661 --> 00:02:25,031
What's the problem, here?

62
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:27,562
Someone has stolen Ambassador
Troi's latinum hairbrooch.

63
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:30,409
I'm sorry, but as the sign says,
the establishment

64
00:02:30,514 --> 00:02:31,778
is not responsible

65
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,982
for the loss
of any personal items.

66
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:35,185
Sign? What sign?

67
00:02:35,227 --> 00:02:36,753
The one above the door.

68
00:02:36,797 --> 00:02:38,768
You'd have to stand on a chair
to read that.

69
00:02:38,803 --> 00:02:39,772
House rules.

70
00:02:39,805 --> 00:02:40,967
I'm very sorry.

71
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:42,568
Have a nice day.

72
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:44,743
You are dealing

73
00:02:44,785 --> 00:02:45,981
with the daughter
of the Fifth House

74
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:47,320
Holder of the Sacred
Chalice of Rixx

75
00:02:47,358 --> 00:02:50,024
Heir to the Holy
Rings of Betazed.

76
00:02:50,065 --> 00:02:51,432
Not my ear, please!

77
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:53,805
Yes, and I know
where it hurts the most

78
00:02:53,842 --> 00:02:55,004
you little troll.

79
00:02:55,045 --> 00:02:57,279
Now, I want this room sealed

80
00:02:57,317 --> 00:02:59,345
and I want everyone
in it strip-searched

81
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,689
until you find my brooch.

82
00:03:00,726 --> 00:03:02,356
May I be of service?

83
00:03:02,397 --> 00:03:03,627
Oh, thank goodness.

84
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:05,604
Our Chief of Security, Odo.

85
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,701
What seems to be the problem?

86
00:03:07,744 --> 00:03:09,442
Well, my brooch has been stolen.

87
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:12,614
It's been in my family
for 36 generations.

88
00:03:12,657 --> 00:03:15,221
It's absolutely priceless
and I want it back.

89
00:03:15,264 --> 00:03:18,066
You're certain
you were wearing it today?

90
00:03:18,104 --> 00:03:19,300
Yes, of course I'm certain.

91
00:03:19,341 --> 00:03:21,471
I never use this hair
without it.

92
00:03:21,547 --> 00:03:24,019
I see.

93
00:03:24,053 --> 00:03:26,081
You're... Betazoid?

94
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,755
Of course.

95
00:03:27,796 --> 00:03:29,494
Telepathic?

96
00:03:29,534 --> 00:03:31,300
Yes.

97
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:33,573
And you sense no guilt
anywhere in this room?

98
00:03:42,501 --> 00:03:45,771
No, but Betazoids
cannot read Ferengis.

99
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,750
Quark has plenty of reason
to feel guilty

100
00:03:48,784 --> 00:03:52,020
but he usually doesn't
have to resort to petty theft

101
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,552
to fleece his clients.

102
00:03:53,596 --> 00:03:55,624
Thank you.

103
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,017
Wait a minute.

104
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,031
Empty your pockets now.

105
00:04:21,201 --> 00:04:22,295
Well...

106
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:25,335
since when did you
join Starfleet?

107
00:04:28,454 --> 00:04:29,923
That's it... that's my brooch.

108
00:04:29,957 --> 00:04:31,085
But how did you know?

109
00:04:31,127 --> 00:04:33,599
Dopterians are distant
relatives of the Ferengi.

110
00:04:33,634 --> 00:04:36,198
It made sense that, since
you couldn't read Quark

111
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,214
you might not be able to read
this charming fellow either.

112
00:04:39,248 --> 00:04:41,982
Oh, how perfectly
brilliant of you.

113
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,295
Doctor, I want to know
everything there is to know

114
00:04:47,336 --> 00:04:49,432
about your Security Chief.

115
00:06:55,406 --> 00:06:57,240
Computer, is the diagnostic

116
00:06:57,277 --> 00:06:59,647
on the fusion power plant
finished yet?

117
00:06:59,683 --> 00:07:00,709
Affirmative.

118
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,987
The fusion power plant
is operating

119
00:07:03,092 --> 00:07:04,858
within normal parameters.

120
00:07:04,897 --> 00:07:06,993
What are you talking about?

121
00:07:07,102 --> 00:07:10,008
It's 13% below normal.

122
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,670
Cardassian specifications

123
00:07:11,715 --> 00:07:14,780
accept operating efficiency
within 20%.

124
00:07:14,823 --> 00:07:16,156
Well, I don't.

125
00:07:16,193 --> 00:07:17,162
Anara.

126
00:07:17,195 --> 00:07:18,425
Yes, sir.

127
00:07:18,465 --> 00:07:21,530
How much do you know
about carbon reaction chambers?

128
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:24,045
I've learned a little
about laser-induced fusion

129
00:07:24,113 --> 00:07:25,673
not much more than the basics.

130
00:07:25,717 --> 00:07:27,277
Ah, it's a bloody
inefficient system.

131
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:30,194
I'd trade it in for a Federation
model tomorrow if I could

132
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:31,391
but it's all we've got.

133
00:07:31,432 --> 00:07:32,731
Do me a favor.

134
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:37,544
Keep an eye on the exhaust
plasma temperature.

135
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,850
Computer, increase
deuterium flow

136
00:07:39,888 --> 00:07:42,690
by five percent
to reaction chamber two.

137
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,699
Procedure is not recommended.

138
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:47,297
Look, I've had enough
of your opinions, damn it.

139
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,437
Just do it!

140
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:51,347
Procedure is not recommended.

141
00:07:51,384 --> 00:07:53,754
Consult Cardassian
operational guidelines

142
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,886
paragraph 254-A, now on screen.

143
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:58,629
I don't want to read
your tech manual.

144
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,661
Fine.

145
00:07:59,705 --> 00:08:01,505
We'll do it ourselves.

146
00:08:03,215 --> 00:08:06,087
Reinitializing reactor two.

147
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:11,032
Directing plasma flow
to conduits 143, 144...

148
00:08:11,068 --> 00:08:13,336
Chief O'Brien, the power flow
from reactor two

149
00:08:13,374 --> 00:08:14,604
has just been shut down.

150
00:08:14,644 --> 00:08:15,874
What?

151
00:08:15,914 --> 00:08:18,945
Computer, analyze
reactor two failure.

152
00:08:18,989 --> 00:08:22,122
Reactor two was shut down
after sensors detected

153
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:25,763
a potential overload
of the carbon reaction chambers.

154
00:08:25,807 --> 00:08:27,778
That's it.
That's the straw!

155
00:08:27,812 --> 00:08:28,838
Relax, Chief.

156
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:30,441
It's just a computer.

157
00:08:30,485 --> 00:08:31,886
This is no computer.

158
00:08:31,923 --> 00:08:33,153
This is my archenemy.

159
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:35,162
You've got it working
just fine, as far I can tell.

160
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,167
Fine? With all due respect,
Commander

161
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:40,175
as an engineer, I couldn't
look at myself in the mirror

162
00:08:40,277 --> 00:08:41,746
if I allowed this computer

163
00:08:41,782 --> 00:08:43,810
to continue to perform
as it is now.

164
00:08:43,854 --> 00:08:45,791
I'll have to do a root canal.

165
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:46,816
Root canal?

166
00:08:46,862 --> 00:08:48,388
It's engineering shorthand, sir.

167
00:08:48,432 --> 00:08:49,867
I'll have to get into its guts

168
00:08:49,902 --> 00:08:51,566
and rebuild it
from the ground up.

169
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:52,906
How long will that take?

170
00:08:52,943 --> 00:08:54,344
Well, I'm still
not that familiar

171
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:55,509
with Cardassian technology

172
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,855
but, oh, I guess no more
than two, three years.

173
00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:01,229
That's going to take
a lot of man-hours.

174
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,494
Is it really necessary?

175
00:09:02,536 --> 00:09:04,302
You don't understand...

176
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,470
Let's just say I don't have

177
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,483
your sensitivity
to the computer.

178
00:09:08,517 --> 00:09:09,679
That's all right.
Forget about it.

179
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,689
Uh, Chief...

180
00:09:10,723 --> 00:09:11,919
It's all right.
It doesn't matter.

181
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,934
Chief, I want you to do
what you have to do.

182
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:16,198
Thank you, sir.

183
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,900
I'll get right on it.

184
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:19,810
And this is Ops.

185
00:09:19,847 --> 00:09:23,380
The heart and soul
of Deep Space 9.

186
00:09:23,423 --> 00:09:26,225
Ah, there you are, Commander.

187
00:09:26,331 --> 00:09:28,701
Gentlemen, Madam Ambassador.

188
00:09:28,737 --> 00:09:31,471
They insisted on seeing
operations, sir.

189
00:09:31,511 --> 00:09:32,480
Of course.

190
00:09:32,514 --> 00:09:34,348
Make yourselves at home.

191
00:09:34,385 --> 00:09:36,356
I trust that Doctor Bashir

192
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,862
has been taking care
of all your needs.

193
00:09:38,897 --> 00:09:42,532
Well, he refuses to change
my accommodations.

194
00:09:42,573 --> 00:09:43,735
Accommodations?

195
00:09:43,776 --> 00:09:46,544
Well, if I have to sleep
another night

196
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,785
on a Cardassian bed
with gargoyles staring at me

197
00:09:49,824 --> 00:09:51,384
from the wood poles...

198
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:53,263
Commander.

199
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:56,868
An unidentified vessel
is coming through the wormhole.

200
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,311
On screen.
Excuse me.

201
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,582
Uh, you'll get a better view
from over here.

202
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,681
Quite a sight, isn't it?

203
00:10:12,718 --> 00:10:14,153
That's it?

204
00:10:14,188 --> 00:10:15,920
That's the whole thing?

205
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,326
Well, yes, it is.

206
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:19,357
I was expecting more, somehow.

207
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:22,967
Scanners aren't picking up
any life-forms on board.

208
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:23,980
A probe?

209
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:25,142
Might be.

210
00:10:25,183 --> 00:10:27,154
I'm reading an extensive
computer array

211
00:10:27,188 --> 00:10:30,356
but no signals to suggest
it's trying to maintain contact

212
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:31,957
with a mother ship.

213
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:33,869
Are the computers
compatible with ours?

214
00:10:33,906 --> 00:10:35,239
It's hard to tell.

215
00:10:35,276 --> 00:10:38,774
I don't recognize any known
subprocessor patterns.

216
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:40,344
Obviously, the young woman
doesn't have

217
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,415
the necessary experience.

218
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:42,428
Perhaps I can...

219
00:10:42,494 --> 00:10:44,124
The "young woman" over there

220
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,900
has over 300 years
experience, Ambassador.

221
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:48,705
I might have better luck

222
00:10:48,744 --> 00:10:51,308
if we towed it
into the docking ring.

223
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,117
No, not until we know
a little bit more about it.

224
00:10:53,155 --> 00:10:55,993
Major, tow it to 500 meters
off the docking ring.

225
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,294
Yes, sir.

226
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,931
Mr. O'Brien, try to set up
an adaptive interface link

227
00:10:59,973 --> 00:11:02,468
and see if we can download
any information from it.

228
00:11:02,513 --> 00:11:03,504
Aye, sir.

229
00:11:05,354 --> 00:11:08,260
I think it will be best
if we clear this area.

230
00:11:08,295 --> 00:11:11,759
But this probe may represent
contact with a new species.

231
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,140
Commander, I think
it would be appropriate

232
00:11:14,177 --> 00:11:15,646
for at least one
Federation ambassador

233
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,674
to be present
at this historic occasion

234
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,691
and since I have
a particular interest

235
00:11:19,725 --> 00:11:21,251
in First Contact procedures...

236
00:11:21,295 --> 00:11:23,733
I appreciate your interest,
Ambassador

237
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:26,936
and to keep you all informed,
I'm scheduling a briefing

238
00:11:26,976 --> 00:11:28,377
at 0400.

239
00:11:28,414 --> 00:11:29,713
In the meantime, Dr. Bashir

240
00:11:29,751 --> 00:11:32,087
the best place
to view this probe

241
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:33,890
is from the docking ring
near Port Seven.

242
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:36,493
I'll show them the way.

243
00:11:59,827 --> 00:12:02,322
Such concentration.

244
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:06,139
Such intensity,
such passion for your work.

245
00:12:06,177 --> 00:12:08,877
Tracking intergalactic
malefactors.

246
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:12,689
Most people find it
rather tedious.

247
00:12:12,727 --> 00:12:14,060
Tedious?

248
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:18,173
No, those of us
who have been beneficiaries

249
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,507
of your heroism

250
00:12:19,545 --> 00:12:22,109
would never call
your work tedious.

251
00:12:22,152 --> 00:12:24,681
We've learned that,
on this station

252
00:12:24,726 --> 00:12:28,600
you are the thin, beige line
between order and chaos.

253
00:12:28,635 --> 00:12:30,606
That's my job.

254
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,272
Now, what can I do for you?

255
00:12:33,314 --> 00:12:36,447
You haven't lost
anything else, I hope.

256
00:12:37,592 --> 00:12:39,620
Only my heart.

257
00:12:39,664 --> 00:12:41,898
I beg your pardon?

258
00:12:41,936 --> 00:12:43,839
Is, um...

259
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,940
is Odo your first or last name?

260
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:48,247
Yes.

261
00:12:48,286 --> 00:12:50,588
Oh. Then I can
just call you, uh?

262
00:12:50,626 --> 00:12:52,460
Odo.

263
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:56,603
It has a certain
lyrical quality.

264
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:59,012
Lyrical?

265
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:00,414
Odo...

266
00:13:00,451 --> 00:13:03,619
It rolls off the tongue.

267
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,392
Uh...

268
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:07,459
I have a lot of work to do.

269
00:13:07,503 --> 00:13:11,001
I understand
you're a shape-shifter.

270
00:13:11,112 --> 00:13:12,513
That's correct.

271
00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:14,144
I've never been
with a shape-shifter.

272
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,617
"Been with?"

273
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:21,103
I've heard that you're
the only one of your kind.

274
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:24,174
So far.

275
00:13:24,213 --> 00:13:25,477
Mmm.

276
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:27,282
All the men I've known

277
00:13:27,321 --> 00:13:31,628
have needed to be shaped,
and molded, and manipulated

278
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,900
and finally I've met a man

279
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,706
who knows how to do it himself.

280
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:38,147
Oh...

281
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,853
Is that the com?

282
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:42,256
I think it is.

283
00:13:42,294 --> 00:13:43,263
Excuse me.

284
00:13:43,296 --> 00:13:45,358
I've got to get to Ops.

285
00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:04,079
Initiating high-resolution scan.

286
00:14:04,116 --> 00:14:05,746
Memory nodes located.

287
00:14:05,787 --> 00:14:08,259
Proceeding with data transfer.

288
00:14:08,294 --> 00:14:10,288
Yeah, there you go.

289
00:14:10,332 --> 00:14:11,596
Who would have thought?

290
00:14:11,635 --> 00:14:13,435
You seem surprised, Chief.

291
00:14:13,474 --> 00:14:16,414
Well, knowing this computer,
I thought I would have had

292
00:14:16,448 --> 00:14:18,578
to reconfigure
the whole emulator module

293
00:14:18,621 --> 00:14:21,093
to make it compatible
with the probe

294
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:23,122
but it's cooperating for once.

295
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,536
Transfer of data is complete.

296
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:28,410
Well done, computer.

297
00:14:28,446 --> 00:14:31,146
Computer,
run standard code translations

298
00:14:31,187 --> 00:14:32,315
on probe data.

299
00:14:32,357 --> 00:14:33,987
Isolate syntax results.

300
00:14:34,027 --> 00:14:35,360
Processing.

301
00:14:35,397 --> 00:14:36,866
Stand by.

302
00:14:40,545 --> 00:14:41,673
Come in.

303
00:14:41,713 --> 00:14:42,841
Yes, Odo.

304
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,683
Commander...

305
00:14:44,721 --> 00:14:46,020
I have a problem.

306
00:14:46,058 --> 00:14:47,027
Quark again?

307
00:14:47,061 --> 00:14:48,360
No, sir.

308
00:14:48,398 --> 00:14:50,426
This one is named Lwaxana.

309
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,304
Lwaxana Troi, the ambassador?

310
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:53,708
That's her.

311
00:14:53,745 --> 00:14:56,947
There was a minor incident
at the bar

312
00:14:56,987 --> 00:15:00,155
that I helped her with,
and now she's...

313
00:15:00,195 --> 00:15:01,494
grateful.

314
00:15:01,532 --> 00:15:03,162
What's the problem?

315
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:07,476
The manner in which she
expresses her gratitude.

316
00:15:07,515 --> 00:15:09,817
To be honest,
Commander, she seems...

317
00:15:09,853 --> 00:15:12,884
interested in me.

318
00:15:14,934 --> 00:15:17,202
What's wrong with that?

319
00:15:17,306 --> 00:15:19,904
She's extremely aggressive.

320
00:15:19,947 --> 00:15:22,442
I see.
So she's after you.

321
00:15:22,487 --> 00:15:25,620
Like a Wanoni tracehound.

322
00:15:25,662 --> 00:15:27,724
Have you thought
of letting her catch you?

323
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:29,738
Sir?

324
00:15:29,772 --> 00:15:32,336
A little romance, Odo.

325
00:15:32,378 --> 00:15:36,377
I have six pylons that need
a complete security sweep.

326
00:15:36,423 --> 00:15:39,864
I don't have time
for romantic interludes.

327
00:15:43,307 --> 00:15:46,840
Frankly, in my humble opinion,
most of you humanoids

328
00:15:46,883 --> 00:15:48,409
spend far too much time

329
00:15:48,454 --> 00:15:50,892
on your
respective mating rituals.

330
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:53,297
It does help the procreation
of one's species.

331
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:58,142
Procreation does not require
changing how you smell

332
00:15:58,179 --> 00:16:01,848
or writing bad poetry,
or sacrificing various plants

333
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:04,521
to serve as tokens of affection.

334
00:16:04,562 --> 00:16:08,869
In any event,
it's all irrelevant to me.

335
00:16:08,907 --> 00:16:10,605
I'm sorry to hear that.

336
00:16:10,645 --> 00:16:12,582
I would appreciate it
if you would

337
00:16:12,617 --> 00:16:14,281
do something about this woman.

338
00:16:14,388 --> 00:16:15,687
Me?

339
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,993
Just tell her to leave me alone.

340
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,294
Constable, you can handle

341
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:22,831
thieves and killers,
but not one Betazoid woman?

342
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:25,941
I understand
thieves and killers.

343
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:28,479
I don't understand... her.

344
00:16:28,524 --> 00:16:30,518
I can't help you, Odo.

345
00:16:30,563 --> 00:16:33,161
I'm just trying to avoid
a diplomatic incident.

346
00:16:33,204 --> 00:16:35,540
I don't want
to insult the Ambassador.

347
00:16:35,576 --> 00:16:36,977
A reasonable concern.

348
00:16:37,013 --> 00:16:40,648
I suggest you handle the matter
with great delicacy.

349
00:16:45,201 --> 00:16:49,942
I don't handle "delicacy"
very well.

350
00:16:53,423 --> 00:16:54,915
The probe appears to be made

351
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,953
out of some sort
of corundium alloy.

352
00:16:56,999 --> 00:17:02,070
Analysis of all subprocessor
modules is complete.

353
00:17:02,112 --> 00:17:03,844
Already?

354
00:17:03,883 --> 00:17:05,216
On screen.

355
00:17:07,091 --> 00:17:08,424
Lieutenant?

356
00:17:12,538 --> 00:17:13,973
No science modules

357
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:15,809
no communications system

358
00:17:15,848 --> 00:17:18,480
and enough computer
capacity to run

359
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:20,185
a Galaxy-class starship.

360
00:17:20,226 --> 00:17:21,195
It's very odd.

361
00:17:21,228 --> 00:17:22,960
That's an awful lot
of computer hardware

362
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:24,400
simply to navigate a probe.

363
00:17:24,504 --> 00:17:25,768
Anything?

364
00:17:25,807 --> 00:17:29,043
Nothing to suggest
the probe's mission...

365
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:31,611
or any hint of its origin.

366
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:41,373
Ah! There you are, Odo!

367
00:17:42,851 --> 00:17:43,820
Have you ever been

368
00:17:43,853 --> 00:17:45,847
on the fourth moon
of Andevian II at dawn?

369
00:17:45,892 --> 00:17:47,361
Can't say I have.

370
00:17:47,396 --> 00:17:49,299
I have the most
wonderful holoprogram.

371
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,964
And I've reserved
a suite for us

372
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:52,201
with that Quark person.

373
00:17:52,242 --> 00:17:55,410
You told Quark that you were
going into a holosuite with me?

374
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,441
Well, of course.

375
00:17:56,486 --> 00:17:58,685
He's preparing a special
picnic basket for us.

376
00:17:58,725 --> 00:17:59,853
Good Lord.

377
00:17:59,895 --> 00:18:01,387
I'm afraid I'm not available.

378
00:18:01,433 --> 00:18:03,735
I have to get to Upper
Pylon 3 immediately.

379
00:18:03,771 --> 00:18:04,740
Madam Ambassador...

380
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:05,970
Oh, Lwaxana.

381
00:18:06,011 --> 00:18:09,281
Um... Upper Pylon 3.

382
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:11,587
I've always wanted
to see an upper pylon.

383
00:18:13,764 --> 00:18:15,394
I know... I'll have Quark

384
00:18:15,435 --> 00:18:18,135
send one of his minions
with our basket.

385
00:18:18,175 --> 00:18:20,305
We'll have our picnic
up there.

386
00:18:20,348 --> 00:18:21,612
Madam Ambassador...

387
00:18:21,652 --> 00:18:22,951
Oh, Lwaxana.

388
00:18:22,988 --> 00:18:24,389
I don't eat.

389
00:18:24,425 --> 00:18:26,795
This is not a real mouth.

390
00:18:26,831 --> 00:18:28,859
It is an approximation of one.

391
00:18:28,903 --> 00:18:31,637
I do not have an esophagus
or a stomach

392
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:33,376
or a digestive system.

393
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,908
I am not like you.

394
00:18:34,952 --> 00:18:39,863
Every 16 hours,
I turn into a liquid.

395
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:41,995
I can swim.

396
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,028
Oh...

397
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,178
Computer?

398
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,623
Computer!

399
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,293
Odo to Ops.

400
00:18:54,336 --> 00:18:56,102
Go ahead, Odo.

401
00:18:56,141 --> 00:18:59,240
Ambassador Troi and I
are stuck in Turbolift 7.

402
00:18:59,282 --> 00:19:00,251
What's going on?

403
00:19:00,285 --> 00:19:02,883
Power to the pylon
turbolifts has failed.

404
00:19:07,237 --> 00:19:09,869
We're reading
a turbolift failure, Odo.

405
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,277
We'll beam you out.

406
00:19:11,313 --> 00:19:12,282
Locking on.

407
00:19:12,316 --> 00:19:13,546
Prepare to transport.

408
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,748
Ready.

409
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,420
Energizing.

410
00:19:22,209 --> 00:19:23,508
Well?

411
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:26,041
Looks like the transporter
is down, too.

412
00:19:26,085 --> 00:19:27,851
But don't worry, Constable.

413
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,054
We'll get it repaired
right away.

414
00:19:30,095 --> 00:19:31,496
Dax to Chief O'Brien.

415
00:19:31,532 --> 00:19:33,594
Please report
to Ops immediately.

416
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:34,901
Be patient, Odo.

417
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:37,471
We'll get you out of there
as soon as we can.

418
00:19:39,653 --> 00:19:42,821
Well, alone at last.

419
00:19:57,471 --> 00:20:00,273
Electromotive coil functions,
normal.

420
00:20:00,311 --> 00:20:02,613
Load detection functions,
normal.

421
00:20:02,651 --> 00:20:04,315
Diagnostic complete.

422
00:20:04,356 --> 00:20:05,518
I don't get it.

423
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:08,431
Every component
of the turbolift power net

424
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:10,164
seems to be operational.

425
00:20:10,204 --> 00:20:13,178
We can't find anything wrong
with the transporter.

426
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,080
Great, everything's
in working order

427
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,517
except nothing's working.

428
00:20:16,553 --> 00:20:19,185
How do we get our people
out of the turbolift, Chief?

429
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:21,792
Well, if we were on a starship,
I'd reroute the EPS power flow

430
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:23,702
in a couple of hours,
but, with this computer

431
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:25,369
there's no telling
how long it'll take.

432
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:26,812
Get it started.

433
00:20:28,484 --> 00:20:30,044
Kira to Odo.

434
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:31,080
Yes, Major?

435
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,253
I'm sorry, but you're going

436
00:20:32,295 --> 00:20:33,959
to have to stay put
for a while longer.

437
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,970
Define "a while."

438
00:20:36,004 --> 00:20:37,907
I wish I knew.

439
00:20:37,943 --> 00:20:41,817
By the way,
Cardassian turbolifts

440
00:20:41,853 --> 00:20:44,087
run exposed, multi-phased
alternating currents

441
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,720
through their
positioning mechanisms

442
00:20:45,763 --> 00:20:47,893
so don't try to shape-shift
your way out.

443
00:20:47,936 --> 00:20:51,138
I wouldn't think of it.

444
00:20:51,177 --> 00:20:54,618
Besides, it wouldn't be polite.

445
00:20:54,652 --> 00:20:56,316
I didn't hear that.

446
00:20:57,927 --> 00:20:59,898
It wouldn't be polite.

447
00:20:59,933 --> 00:21:01,493
Understood.

448
00:21:01,537 --> 00:21:03,337
Kira out.

449
00:21:06,116 --> 00:21:08,588
Do you suppose that we're, uh...

450
00:21:08,623 --> 00:21:11,095
we're actually in any danger?

451
00:21:11,129 --> 00:21:13,259
Not if we remain calm.

452
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:14,600
Ah.

453
00:21:14,638 --> 00:21:18,603
Well, then we might as well
enjoy ourselves.

454
00:21:18,649 --> 00:21:22,489
Uh, we can take the opportunity
to get to know each other.

455
00:21:22,525 --> 00:21:26,696
I'd really prefer
to pass the time quietly.

456
00:21:26,735 --> 00:21:28,706
- Quietly.
- Quietly.

457
00:21:28,741 --> 00:21:29,710
Of course.

458
00:21:29,743 --> 00:21:30,712
Thank you.

459
00:21:30,746 --> 00:21:31,737
Mmm.

460
00:21:38,701 --> 00:21:40,170
The quiet man.

461
00:21:40,204 --> 00:21:42,506
Hmm.

462
00:21:42,544 --> 00:21:45,882
You know, I've always been
attracted to quiet men.

463
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,913
Odd, isn't it?

464
00:21:47,957 --> 00:21:49,119
But maybe there's

465
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,969
more truth than we realize
to that old axiom that op...

466
00:21:55,678 --> 00:21:57,672
Quietly.

467
00:22:07,709 --> 00:22:09,339
Odo.

468
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,687
Yes?

469
00:22:12,722 --> 00:22:15,217
I don't think I can.

470
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,667
Can what?

471
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:21,702
Well, you don't have
to say another word

472
00:22:21,745 --> 00:22:23,716
as long as we're here

473
00:22:23,751 --> 00:22:27,591
but I, I think
I really need to talk.

474
00:22:30,936 --> 00:22:32,930
I understand.

475
00:22:37,787 --> 00:22:40,316
There's nothing to be afraid of.

476
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:42,057
Of course not.

477
00:22:42,098 --> 00:22:44,332
No, things could be much worse.

478
00:22:44,438 --> 00:22:45,930
Really?

479
00:22:47,445 --> 00:22:50,247
My daughter and I
were once trapped

480
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:53,260
aboard a Ferengi cargo ship,
and it was dreadful.

481
00:22:53,294 --> 00:22:56,200
Well, all right,
it wasn't actually dreadful.

482
00:22:56,234 --> 00:22:58,205
It was mildly lamentable

483
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,237
and it was all because
of that loathsome DaiMon.

484
00:23:01,282 --> 00:23:02,512
Well...

485
00:23:02,552 --> 00:23:04,956
actually, he wasn't
altogether loathsome.

486
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:08,089
He was just slightly repulsive.

487
00:23:08,132 --> 00:23:12,097
But he did have
a certain charm...

488
00:23:12,143 --> 00:23:15,744
in an insufferable kind of way.

489
00:23:15,786 --> 00:23:18,258
Of course, he was
totally at the mercy

490
00:23:18,292 --> 00:23:20,764
of his uncontrollable
passion for me

491
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,263
which means he wasn't
all bad, now, doesn't it?

492
00:23:24,307 --> 00:23:26,779
And you know, it wasn't
all passion, no.

493
00:23:26,814 --> 00:23:30,688
There was some negligible
commercial interest involved

494
00:23:30,725 --> 00:23:33,129
but, oh, the passion...

495
00:23:33,164 --> 00:23:36,297
oh, that was...
that was perfectly real

496
00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:39,837
and kind of, um,
kind of sweet in a way.

497
00:23:39,881 --> 00:23:42,251
He was so helpless.

498
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:45,660
At first, it was totally
a question of expediency

499
00:23:45,696 --> 00:23:47,998
when I made love with him.

500
00:23:48,036 --> 00:23:50,565
What are you looking at?

501
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:52,911
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

502
00:23:52,949 --> 00:23:54,077
Oh.

503
00:23:54,118 --> 00:23:56,146
Uh, nothing.

504
00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:00,098
I was just wondering
how many volts

505
00:24:00,134 --> 00:24:01,660
are in that exposed circuit.

506
00:24:01,705 --> 00:24:03,335
Go on. Go on.

507
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:05,712
Well... frankly

508
00:24:05,749 --> 00:24:07,583
by the time one thing
led to another...

509
00:24:09,626 --> 00:24:12,064
Think of it
as an opportunity, Doctor.

510
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:13,831
You never know
when a friendly ambassador

511
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,270
is going to be
in the right place

512
00:24:15,307 --> 00:24:16,937
at the right time
to help your career.

513
00:24:16,977 --> 00:24:20,008
Another hour with them
could destroy my career.

514
00:24:20,052 --> 00:24:21,385
It's a simple job.

515
00:24:21,423 --> 00:24:23,793
Just keep them happy
and away from me.

516
00:24:23,828 --> 00:24:24,956
Simple?

517
00:24:24,998 --> 00:24:26,992
Nothing makes them happy.

518
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:29,408
They are dedicated
to being unhappy

519
00:24:29,443 --> 00:24:31,847
and to spreading that
unhappiness wherever they go.

520
00:24:31,883 --> 00:24:34,982
They are the Ambassadors
of Unhappy.

521
00:24:36,161 --> 00:24:38,291
All of us have had
these assignments, Doctor.

522
00:24:38,334 --> 00:24:39,303
Have you, sir?

523
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:40,396
As a matter of fact

524
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:42,501
Curzon Dax
used to take perverse pleasure

525
00:24:42,577 --> 00:24:44,811
in assigning me
to take care of VIP guests.

526
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,983
Oh, so now you take
the same perverse pleasure

527
00:24:48,025 --> 00:24:49,426
in doing it to me.

528
00:24:49,462 --> 00:24:50,988
Exactly.

529
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:52,502
May I ask, sir

530
00:24:52,536 --> 00:24:56,137
when you graduated
from this sort of assignment?

531
00:24:58,118 --> 00:25:01,115
The day I hit one of the guests.

532
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:02,594
Hit one...

533
00:25:02,629 --> 00:25:04,931
It was a simple misunderstanding

534
00:25:04,969 --> 00:25:07,943
over his attempt
to coax a young Ensign

535
00:25:07,977 --> 00:25:10,779
to his quarters
against her will.

536
00:25:10,817 --> 00:25:13,187
But...

537
00:25:13,223 --> 00:25:16,129
don't hit one of them,
Doctor.

538
00:25:16,165 --> 00:25:19,401
I'm not nearly as understanding
as Curzon was.

539
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,674
Yes, sir.

540
00:25:21,712 --> 00:25:24,880
Commander, can I talk to you?

541
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,930
It's about the computer, sir.

542
00:25:28,964 --> 00:25:30,559
Still giving you problems?

543
00:25:30,602 --> 00:25:32,573
No, sir, that's just the thing,
it's not.

544
00:25:32,674 --> 00:25:35,306
It rerouted the EPS power flow
in less than an hour.

545
00:25:35,348 --> 00:25:36,578
That's good news.

546
00:25:36,651 --> 00:25:38,919
How soon can we get Odo
and the Ambassador out?

547
00:25:38,957 --> 00:25:39,948
We can't.

548
00:25:39,993 --> 00:25:41,759
It didn't activate
the turbolift circuits.

549
00:25:41,798 --> 00:25:43,165
Don't ask me why.

550
00:25:43,201 --> 00:25:45,104
You must have some idea
of what's wrong.

551
00:25:45,139 --> 00:25:49,138
I want you to listen
to something.

552
00:25:49,184 --> 00:25:53,753
Computer, analyze Ops
0-2 sensor readings.

553
00:25:53,795 --> 00:26:00,575
All sensors read
between 14.3 and 14.4 KSC.

554
00:26:03,153 --> 00:26:08,121
Computer, restart all shield
generator subsystems.

555
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:11,572
Shield generator subsystems
set to active status.

556
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:14,481
Reading 98.3% efficiency.

557
00:26:14,516 --> 00:26:16,487
Do you hear it?

558
00:26:18,092 --> 00:26:19,561
Hear what?

559
00:26:19,596 --> 00:26:22,228
The voice...
it's not the same attitude.

560
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,865
It sounds like the computer.

561
00:26:23,907 --> 00:26:26,779
Sir, when you work
with a computer as much as I do

562
00:26:26,815 --> 00:26:27,909
you get to know it.

563
00:26:27,951 --> 00:26:29,649
They're all very different.

564
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,624
Working with
the <i>Enterprise</i> computer

565
00:26:31,661 --> 00:26:33,028
was like dancing a waltz.

566
00:26:33,064 --> 00:26:35,832
With this computer, it's always
been like a wrestling match...

567
00:26:35,871 --> 00:26:38,139
till we started
downloading the probe.

568
00:26:38,177 --> 00:26:40,239
You think some kind
of program from the probe

569
00:26:40,282 --> 00:26:41,912
is influencing our computer?

570
00:26:41,954 --> 00:26:44,928
Well, it's got to be more
than just a program, sir.

571
00:26:44,962 --> 00:26:47,594
The computer's whole personality
has changed.

572
00:26:47,635 --> 00:26:49,834
It's not resisting any commands

573
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,906
offering any opinions,
giving any arguments

574
00:26:52,949 --> 00:26:55,717
and there's this
one other crazy thing

575
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,092
I'm almost afraid to mention.

576
00:26:58,129 --> 00:26:59,257
What's that?

577
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:00,632
Every time I leave

578
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:02,640
something happens
to bring me back.

579
00:27:02,674 --> 00:27:03,973
Bring you back?

580
00:27:04,011 --> 00:27:06,141
To the computer...
like the failures

581
00:27:06,184 --> 00:27:08,520
to the turbolifts
and the transporters.

582
00:27:08,557 --> 00:27:10,859
A few minutes ago, I was working
at the transporter pad

583
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,025
and the com lines went down

584
00:27:13,068 --> 00:27:15,370
and when I broke
for a quick bite to eat

585
00:27:15,407 --> 00:27:17,378
we had a replicator failure.

586
00:27:17,413 --> 00:27:19,179
It's almost like the computer

587
00:27:19,218 --> 00:27:21,280
doesn't want me
to leave it alone.

588
00:27:21,323 --> 00:27:24,297
You almost make it sound
like a child.

589
00:27:33,074 --> 00:27:35,376
Station Log, supplemental.

590
00:27:35,413 --> 00:27:39,048
Odo and Ambassador Troi
remain trapped in Turbolift 4.

591
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:41,995
As of yet, we have been unable
to ascertain what it is

592
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,027
that's causing the station's
computer to malfunction.

593
00:27:45,072 --> 00:27:47,874
What if it's some kind
of nonbiological life-form

594
00:27:47,912 --> 00:27:49,347
we've never seen before?

595
00:27:49,383 --> 00:27:51,513
Nonbiological?

596
00:27:51,555 --> 00:27:54,620
Well, it all comes down
to how we define life-form.

597
00:27:54,663 --> 00:27:58,628
But just as biological organisms
have evolved in our cultures

598
00:27:58,674 --> 00:28:01,169
mechanical life could have
done the same in others.

599
00:28:01,214 --> 00:28:05,122
You're suggesting someone
left a baby at our doorstep.

600
00:28:05,157 --> 00:28:06,626
Possibly.

601
00:28:06,661 --> 00:28:08,359
Do you think we can
communicate with it?

602
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,131
Well, in a way, we already have.

603
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:12,540
I mean, it's part and parcel
of our computer now.

604
00:28:12,576 --> 00:28:14,740
But as far as direct
communication is concerned

605
00:28:14,782 --> 00:28:16,183
it may not be capable of that.

606
00:28:16,219 --> 00:28:18,953
We haven't seen any evidence
that this entity is sentient.

607
00:28:18,993 --> 00:28:20,553
Maybe more like a stray puppy

608
00:28:20,597 --> 00:28:22,397
that's attached itself
to you, Chief.

609
00:28:22,436 --> 00:28:24,931
Whatever it is, it's slowly
disabling our station.

610
00:28:24,975 --> 00:28:27,003
People, we've got
to get it out of there.

611
00:28:27,047 --> 00:28:30,283
It came here when we downloaded
the probe's files.

612
00:28:30,322 --> 00:28:33,592
If we upload those same files
back to the probe

613
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,294
it might go with them.

614
00:28:35,368 --> 00:28:38,000
What if it's fully integrated
itself into our computer?

615
00:28:38,042 --> 00:28:39,637
I don't think it has.

616
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,514
That would make it
more like a virus.

617
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:44,616
But I don't see any evidence
that it's trying to overwrite

618
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:46,995
our control networks
or destroy our systems.

619
00:28:47,032 --> 00:28:48,832
I think it's more
likely that it simply

620
00:28:48,871 --> 00:28:49,840
creates connections

621
00:28:49,873 --> 00:28:51,901
with areas of the computer
that are active.

622
00:28:51,945 --> 00:28:53,813
Almost as though it
feeds off the energy

623
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,183
of the computer functions.

624
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:58,126
If I'm right, transferring
all of its programming

625
00:28:58,162 --> 00:29:00,964
off the station might
just solve our problems.

626
00:29:05,714 --> 00:29:08,312
How long since we had
any communication from Odo?

627
00:29:08,388 --> 00:29:10,986
Com lines have been
down over 90 minutes.

628
00:29:11,028 --> 00:29:13,330
He's been in there
almost four hours now.

629
00:29:13,401 --> 00:29:15,338
Do you happen to know
the schedule

630
00:29:15,372 --> 00:29:16,932
of his regenerative cycle?

631
00:29:16,977 --> 00:29:18,948
My God, I have no idea

632
00:29:18,982 --> 00:29:22,286
but if he doesn't get back
to his pail in time...

633
00:29:30,345 --> 00:29:32,749
Subspace emitter aligned.

634
00:29:32,784 --> 00:29:35,382
Outgoing data stream activated.

635
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:39,127
Computer, upload
all probe command sequences

636
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:41,138
back to probe's computer.

637
00:29:41,172 --> 00:29:43,336
Stand by.

638
00:29:43,379 --> 00:29:45,613
Unable to complete
requested function.

639
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:48,625
Please abort and retry.

640
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:50,789
Reset subspace emitter.

641
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:53,805
Reinitialize data stream.

642
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:55,810
Receptors open.

643
00:29:55,844 --> 00:29:59,445
Control relays activated.

644
00:29:59,487 --> 00:30:02,255
Upload all probe
command sequences

645
00:30:02,294 --> 00:30:04,356
back to probe's computers.

646
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,370
Stand by.

647
00:30:10,014 --> 00:30:14,925
It's not as easy as I thought
it would be, Commander.

648
00:30:16,531 --> 00:30:19,129
Is it just the lights
or the heat, too?

649
00:30:19,171 --> 00:30:21,301
I didn't bring any warm clothes.

650
00:30:21,343 --> 00:30:23,611
I'm sure it's just temporary.

651
00:30:23,649 --> 00:30:25,517
I've been reading the reports

652
00:30:25,621 --> 00:30:28,025
of your Chief of Operations,
Doctor.

653
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:29,827
They gave me the impression

654
00:30:29,866 --> 00:30:31,996
that he was
a competent engineer.

655
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,531
Chief O'Brien?

656
00:30:33,575 --> 00:30:34,908
One of the best in Starfleet.

657
00:30:34,945 --> 00:30:37,349
Then why aren't
the backup systems functioning?

658
00:30:37,385 --> 00:30:38,854
Well, you know

659
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:41,054
out here on the edge
of the frontier

660
00:30:41,095 --> 00:30:44,228
it's just one adventure
after another.

661
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:47,210
Why don't I escort you all
back to your quarters?

662
00:30:47,244 --> 00:30:50,616
Where I'm sure we can
all wait this one out.

663
00:31:01,247 --> 00:31:03,377
But enough about me.

664
00:31:04,957 --> 00:31:06,256
Hmm?

665
00:31:06,293 --> 00:31:07,923
Enough about me.

666
00:31:07,965 --> 00:31:11,269
Tell me about yourself.

667
00:31:11,306 --> 00:31:13,801
I'm really a private man.

668
00:31:15,484 --> 00:31:17,820
Yes, of course you are.

669
00:31:20,664 --> 00:31:22,658
Is that hair real?

670
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:28,078
It is real in that it is me.

671
00:31:28,117 --> 00:31:29,951
It is not real hair.

672
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:33,226
How did you do it?

673
00:31:33,263 --> 00:31:35,497
Your hair.

674
00:31:35,536 --> 00:31:37,940
It took a great deal
of practice.

675
00:31:37,976 --> 00:31:40,814
You studied hairstyles?

676
00:31:43,557 --> 00:31:46,121
If you must know

677
00:31:46,164 --> 00:31:48,135
I imitated the hairstyle

678
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:51,143
of the Bajoran man
who was assigned to me.

679
00:31:51,177 --> 00:31:53,479
Assigned?

680
00:31:53,516 --> 00:31:56,490
To study me
at the research center.

681
00:31:56,524 --> 00:31:58,792
He was a scientist.

682
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:02,397
You mean that's how you grew up

683
00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:04,877
in a laboratory?

684
00:32:04,912 --> 00:32:07,646
I did not grow up

685
00:32:07,753 --> 00:32:10,021
as you think of it.

686
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:14,264
It was merely a transition
from what I used to be

687
00:32:14,304 --> 00:32:16,275
to what I learned to become.

688
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,007
Oh.

689
00:32:20,118 --> 00:32:22,818
It sounds very lonely to me.

690
00:32:26,034 --> 00:32:29,703
I was always
very self-sufficient.

691
00:32:29,777 --> 00:32:32,579
I'm sure you had to be...

692
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,417
uh, to survive

693
00:32:34,456 --> 00:32:38,091
being... being so different
from everyone else.

694
00:32:42,042 --> 00:32:46,007
Odo to Ops.
Odo to Ops.

695
00:32:46,053 --> 00:32:48,024
Com lines are still down.

696
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:50,360
I don't know
what's taking so long.

697
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:52,301
Are you sure you're all right?

698
00:32:52,336 --> 00:32:53,635
You look warm.

699
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:57,078
It's nothing.
I'm fine.

700
00:32:57,114 --> 00:33:01,079
Oh, I can't imagine
how it must have been.

701
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:04,897
You know, if it bothers
you to talk about this...

702
00:33:04,935 --> 00:33:08,068
Not at all.

703
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,081
What was it like?

704
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:14,080
I guess you could say
I was the life of the party.

705
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:16,097
I don't think I understand.

706
00:33:16,131 --> 00:33:18,433
My way of trying to fit in...

707
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:21,467
I found I could be entertaining.

708
00:33:21,511 --> 00:33:23,175
"Odo, be a chair."

709
00:33:23,216 --> 00:33:24,310
I'm a chair.

710
00:33:24,352 --> 00:33:25,321
"Odo, be a razorcat."

711
00:33:25,354 --> 00:33:26,323
I'm a razorcat.

712
00:33:26,357 --> 00:33:27,883
Life of the party.

713
00:33:29,499 --> 00:33:32,803
I hate parties.

714
00:33:34,745 --> 00:33:38,744
Perhaps you've been going
to the wrong ones.

715
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:40,623
Come to one of mine, Odo.

716
00:33:40,661 --> 00:33:42,825
I'll make sure
that all the guests

717
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,338
are there to entertain you.

718
00:33:50,754 --> 00:33:52,657
Now, now, you're not well.

719
00:33:52,692 --> 00:33:54,424
No, it's fine.

720
00:33:54,463 --> 00:33:56,457
It's just a...

721
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:02,711
I told you I turn
into a liquid every 16 hours.

722
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:07,858
Well, I'm in hour 15.

723
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:18,351
Ready, Commander.

724
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:20,329
How long do you
expect it to take?

725
00:34:20,364 --> 00:34:21,424
Well, if it works

726
00:34:21,467 --> 00:34:23,701
we ought to be able to get
all the probe's files

727
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,870
manually transferred
to the six isolinear rods

728
00:34:25,911 --> 00:34:27,039
in less than 60 seconds.

729
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:28,209
Let's do it.

730
00:34:28,251 --> 00:34:31,657
Computer, run
a level-1 diagnostic

731
00:34:31,693 --> 00:34:33,527
of all power systems on board.

732
00:34:33,564 --> 00:34:36,298
Requested function
will require 43 minutes.

733
00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:37,363
Stand by.

734
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:43,042
Computer, give me an analysis

735
00:34:43,077 --> 00:34:44,741
of all Cardassian traffic
along the border.

736
00:34:44,814 --> 00:34:46,044
Processing long-range sensors.

737
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,248
Stand by.

738
00:34:49,594 --> 00:34:52,762
Computer,
create a historical data base

739
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:55,341
for all known wormhole activity.

740
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:57,005
Indicate time parameters.

741
00:34:57,047 --> 00:34:58,779
All known occurrences.

742
00:34:58,818 --> 00:35:03,525
Requested function
will require subspace link-up.

743
00:35:03,563 --> 00:35:08,064
In that case, create a subspace
link with Nehru Colony

744
00:35:08,109 --> 00:35:13,180
New France Colony
and Corado I Transmitter Array.

745
00:35:13,222 --> 00:35:16,287
Attempting link-up.

746
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,928
Stand by...

747
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:22,776
Computer, access musical files
in the Bajor Master Data Banks

748
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,682
and create a concert program
of Bajoran serenas.

749
00:35:25,721 --> 00:35:29,185
Stand... by...

750
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:32,602
Unable to...

751
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:35,103
Stand...

752
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,561
I'm reading a huge plasma surge
in the Habitat Ring.

753
00:35:41,595 --> 00:35:43,759
You tell Commander Sisko that I
expect that probe briefing

754
00:35:43,802 --> 00:35:46,776
to be held on schedule,
lights or no lights.

755
00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:48,439
I will surely pass
that on, Ambassador.

756
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,820
We've got a plasma explosion

757
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:55,832
in corridor H-12-A,
guest quarters.

758
00:35:55,866 --> 00:35:57,496
The computer's not responding.

759
00:35:57,537 --> 00:35:59,839
None of the fire suppression
systems are coming on line.

760
00:35:59,876 --> 00:36:01,642
I'm reading four life-forms
in that corridor.

761
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:02,650
Major, you're with me.

762
00:36:02,684 --> 00:36:04,210
Chief, get an emergency crew
down there.

763
00:36:04,254 --> 00:36:05,348
We'll need manual fire gear.

764
00:36:05,391 --> 00:36:06,382
Aye, sir.

765
00:36:44,191 --> 00:36:46,185
Phasers at maximum.

766
00:36:51,644 --> 00:36:53,444
Toranium inlay,
Cardassian design...

767
00:36:53,482 --> 00:36:54,644
I should have guessed.

768
00:36:54,685 --> 00:36:56,588
We're going to need a bipolar
torch to get through it.

769
00:36:56,624 --> 00:36:57,718
Then get a message to Ops.

770
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,959
Tell them it's going to take us
a while to get inside.

771
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:02,266
If they can't get the fire
suppression systems on line

772
00:37:02,305 --> 00:37:03,900
we're going to lose
our people in there.

773
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:05,001
Aye, sir.

774
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:09,922
It's not paying
any attention to me.

775
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:12,260
I guess it just
doesn't want to leave...

776
00:37:12,298 --> 00:37:14,600
like a scared puppy.

777
00:37:14,637 --> 00:37:17,439
We have no idea how long
that probe was tumbling

778
00:37:17,477 --> 00:37:19,345
through space... maybe years...

779
00:37:19,382 --> 00:37:21,718
with that life-form
alone on board.

780
00:37:21,755 --> 00:37:24,854
It's sort of like shutting up
a puppy in a room, you know?

781
00:37:24,897 --> 00:37:26,959
I had a pup once.

782
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,300
If I had to lock him up

783
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,972
he'd scratch forever at the door
trying to get out.

784
00:37:31,046 --> 00:37:33,814
I'm not sure I know
what you're getting at.

785
00:37:33,853 --> 00:37:35,983
Pups don't like
to be left alone.

786
00:37:36,026 --> 00:37:37,325
They like attention.

787
00:37:37,363 --> 00:37:39,961
This one is certainly
getting a lot of it.

788
00:37:40,003 --> 00:37:41,199
That's right.

789
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:44,007
So it's no wonder
it doesn't want to leave.

790
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,644
Okay, but how is that
going to help us?

791
00:37:46,687 --> 00:37:48,715
Everything we've seen suggests

792
00:37:48,759 --> 00:37:51,892
that this entity likes
to be where the action is.

793
00:37:51,933 --> 00:37:54,531
It seems to feed off the energy
of an active computer.

794
00:37:54,574 --> 00:37:58,015
We've been trying to separate it
from what it thrives on.

795
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:01,183
We've got to do
the exact opposite.

796
00:38:01,224 --> 00:38:02,523
The exact opposite?

797
00:38:02,561 --> 00:38:05,899
Lieutenant, I've got
to build a doghouse.

798
00:38:16,965 --> 00:38:19,460
Odo to Ops.

799
00:38:23,816 --> 00:38:25,285
Odo out.

800
00:38:25,321 --> 00:38:28,055
Odo, turn around.

801
00:38:28,161 --> 00:38:30,064
I can't.

802
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:32,160
It's beginning.

803
00:38:32,205 --> 00:38:34,176
It's all right.

804
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:36,340
You don't understand.

805
00:38:36,382 --> 00:38:40,256
No one has ever seen me
like this before.

806
00:38:40,293 --> 00:38:43,962
Not even the scientist
who was assigned to you?

807
00:38:44,002 --> 00:38:45,632
That was different.

808
00:38:45,673 --> 00:38:48,647
It was only research to him.

809
00:38:48,681 --> 00:38:52,623
But you don't have
to be ashamed with me.

810
00:38:52,658 --> 00:38:54,356
I'm not ashamed.

811
00:38:54,396 --> 00:38:59,671
It's a private matter,
that's all.

812
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:03,208
How can I make it easier
for you?

813
00:39:03,252 --> 00:39:05,382
You can't.

814
00:39:05,425 --> 00:39:07,419
I'm fine.

815
00:39:14,883 --> 00:39:16,854
What's that?

816
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:18,882
My hair.

817
00:39:27,815 --> 00:39:31,450
No one's ever seen me like this.

818
00:39:31,492 --> 00:39:33,862
Why?

819
00:39:33,898 --> 00:39:36,700
It looks fine.

820
00:39:38,443 --> 00:39:40,414
It looks ordinary.

821
00:39:40,449 --> 00:39:43,913
I've never cared to be ordinary.

822
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:47,593
So you see, Odo,
even we non-shape-shifters

823
00:39:47,634 --> 00:39:50,802
have to change who we are
once in a while.

824
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:56,680
You are not at all
what I expected.

825
00:39:59,665 --> 00:40:03,334
No one's ever paid me
a greater compliment.

826
00:40:11,229 --> 00:40:16,574
I... cannot hold my shape
any longer.

827
00:40:18,615 --> 00:40:20,609
Let go.

828
00:40:22,223 --> 00:40:24,559
I'll take care of you.

829
00:40:33,203 --> 00:40:35,003
We're going to need
portable oxygen

830
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:36,010
and get anything

831
00:40:36,043 --> 00:40:38,105
Bashir has in stock
to treat plasma burns.

832
00:40:38,149 --> 00:40:39,175
Have a runabout ready

833
00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:41,623
to evacuate these people
to Bajor if we need to.

834
00:40:41,658 --> 00:40:42,649
Yes, sir.

835
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:47,338
Anara?

836
00:40:47,374 --> 00:40:50,280
The subprogram is ready, Chief.

837
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:53,847
Computer, analyze subprogram
labeled "Pup."

838
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:58,459
Requested subprogram is a series
of bidirectional data transfer

839
00:40:58,502 --> 00:41:00,268
and monitoring commands.

840
00:41:00,307 --> 00:41:03,281
Reroute all main computer
backup functions

841
00:41:03,315 --> 00:41:05,149
through this subprogram.

842
00:41:05,186 --> 00:41:07,658
All backup functions rerouted.

843
00:41:07,693 --> 00:41:09,253
Great.

844
00:41:09,297 --> 00:41:10,927
Okay, computer.

845
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,598
Now, listen carefully.

846
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:15,943
I want to transfer
all probe command sequences

847
00:41:15,981 --> 00:41:19,479
out of core memory
and into the subprogram, Pup.

848
00:41:19,523 --> 00:41:20,856
Stand by.

849
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:24,892
Transfer complete.

850
00:41:26,608 --> 00:41:27,907
Dax to Sisko.

851
00:41:27,945 --> 00:41:29,677
Fire suppression is responding.

852
00:41:29,716 --> 00:41:31,346
All systems are back on line.

853
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:32,379
Can you get in?

854
00:41:35,464 --> 00:41:38,130
We're in, Dax.
Stand by.

855
00:41:59,126 --> 00:42:02,123
We'd better advise
Starfleet Command.

856
00:42:07,982 --> 00:42:09,748
Are you all right?

857
00:42:09,787 --> 00:42:12,727
Here, take my hand,
Madam Ambassador.

858
00:42:12,761 --> 00:42:14,391
Watch your head.

859
00:42:15,936 --> 00:42:17,303
Please, Julian.

860
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,972
Call me Taxco.

861
00:42:20,014 --> 00:42:22,316
Ambassador, are you all right?

862
00:42:22,353 --> 00:42:24,689
Yes. Thanks to Julian.

863
00:42:28,202 --> 00:42:31,506
The Doctor was remarkably
calm and logical

864
00:42:31,544 --> 00:42:35,281
for a man of his years
under such severe conditions.

865
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,192
We'll be putting him in
for a commendation.

866
00:42:42,238 --> 00:42:44,642
Nice work, Dr. Bashir.

867
00:42:44,744 --> 00:42:48,242
Just in the right place
at the right time, sir.

868
00:42:54,704 --> 00:42:57,268
Well, it's about time.

869
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:05,020
I... know that wasn't
exactly what you had in mind

870
00:43:05,063 --> 00:43:07,227
for your picnic.

871
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:09,070
When it comes to picnics

872
00:43:09,108 --> 00:43:11,580
the only thing
that really matters

873
00:43:11,614 --> 00:43:12,913
is the company.

874
00:43:12,951 --> 00:43:18,226
Your sensitivity and discretion
are appreciated.

875
00:43:19,602 --> 00:43:21,573
Well...

876
00:43:21,607 --> 00:43:23,909
next time you see me

877
00:43:23,946 --> 00:43:26,943
I'll give you
a lot more to appreciate.

878
00:43:38,584 --> 00:43:41,717
How did you beat that thing
in the computer, Chief?

879
00:43:41,759 --> 00:43:42,728
I didn't.

880
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:44,230
He adopted it.

881
00:43:44,265 --> 00:43:45,234
Adopted it?

882
00:43:45,268 --> 00:43:46,669
Well, I was able
to get our friend

883
00:43:46,705 --> 00:43:49,075
out of the main command pathways
and into a subprogram.

884
00:43:49,112 --> 00:43:51,550
You're suggesting
we leave it in there?

885
00:43:51,585 --> 00:43:52,713
I don't see why not.

886
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:55,159
It's happy.
It's not bothering us anymore.

887
00:43:55,194 --> 00:43:57,358
Well, it seems
the humane thing to do.

888
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,066
It's just another new life-form
visiting the station.

889
00:44:00,106 --> 00:44:01,405
I'll take care of it.

890
00:44:01,444 --> 00:44:04,076
Make sure it gets
enough attention and all.

891
00:44:04,117 --> 00:44:06,612
Keep it off the furniture.

892
00:44:06,657 --> 00:44:08,321
Yes, sir.
