1
00:00:02,731 --> 00:00:07,696
Science Officer's Log,
Stardate 47603.3.

2
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:09,175
Commander Sisko has assigned me

3
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:11,145
to investigate an unusual
particle field

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,275
detected on the other side
of the wormhole.

5
00:00:13,318 --> 00:00:15,811
Odo has come along
to the Gamma Quadrant

6
00:00:15,857 --> 00:00:18,089
hoping to find clues
to his origin.

7
00:00:18,128 --> 00:00:20,598
So you see, Ensign Manwaring
has spent the last two weeks

8
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:22,535
avoiding the Assay Office
because he thought

9
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,506
that Freyla was in love
with Lieutenant Strek

10
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:27,138
but all the while, Strek was
seeing Security Officer Seelee.

11
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:29,445
And Freyla was waiting for
Manwaring to ask her out.

12
00:00:29,483 --> 00:00:32,649
Officer Seelee has seemed
distracted at work lately.

13
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:35,390
I'm going to have to talk
to her about this

14
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:37,399
when we get back to the station.

15
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:39,801
Odo, I didn't tell you
that story

16
00:00:39,838 --> 00:00:41,501
to get Seelee in trouble.

17
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,941
Frankly, Lieutenant

18
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:46,177
I fail to see any point
in your story at all

19
00:00:46,217 --> 00:00:48,210
except perhaps to illustrate

20
00:00:48,254 --> 00:00:50,690
the foolish humanoid
preoccupation

21
00:00:50,727 --> 00:00:52,424
with romantic coupling.

22
00:00:52,463 --> 00:00:56,062
The point is that, sometimes,
we don't see true love

23
00:00:56,104 --> 00:00:58,701
even when it's staring us
right in the face.

24
00:00:58,743 --> 00:01:02,204
How fascinating.

25
00:01:02,282 --> 00:01:04,650
Let me give you another example.

26
00:01:04,688 --> 00:01:06,214
You know Lysia Arlin?

27
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,524
The Bolian woman
who runs the <i>jumja</i> kiosk.

28
00:01:09,563 --> 00:01:12,660
I've noticed she's been making
a lot of visits

29
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,230
to the security office lately.

30
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,638
She has a cousin

31
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:18,671
who's interested in a career
in law enforcement.

32
00:01:18,716 --> 00:01:20,447
You don't say.

33
00:01:21,822 --> 00:01:26,594
Are you implying that Lysia
Arlin is interested in me?

34
00:01:29,303 --> 00:01:30,932
Ridiculous.

35
00:01:30,973 --> 00:01:32,772
I would have noticed.

36
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:34,644
Exactly my point.

37
00:01:35,983 --> 00:01:37,953
You must be mistaken.

38
00:01:37,987 --> 00:01:40,287
And how can you be so sure?

39
00:01:40,358 --> 00:01:44,560
Because women don't react
to me in that manner.

40
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,061
Are you saying that you've
never had a female friend?

41
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:51,079
I consider Major Kira a friend.

42
00:01:51,113 --> 00:01:53,481
That's not what I meant.

43
00:01:53,518 --> 00:01:55,488
I'm talking about...

44
00:01:55,522 --> 00:01:57,788
an intimate friendship.

45
00:01:59,363 --> 00:02:01,799
That's a very personal question.

46
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:03,771
I'm sorry, but after
seven lifetimes

47
00:02:03,806 --> 00:02:06,607
the impersonal questions
aren't much fun anymore.

48
00:02:08,414 --> 00:02:11,147
Looks like we found
our particle field.

49
00:02:12,657 --> 00:02:14,524
They're omicron particles.

50
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,291
Is that unusual?

51
00:02:16,364 --> 00:02:18,561
Omicron particles
are incredibly rare.

52
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:20,035
They can only be created

53
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:23,009
by certain types of
matter/antimatter reactions.

54
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:24,535
The field seems to be coming

55
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,982
from the second planet
in the system.

56
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:28,750
Let's go in a little closer.

57
00:02:31,895 --> 00:02:33,227
That's strange.

58
00:02:33,264 --> 00:02:37,329
The particles are concentrated
in one small valley.

59
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,277
Sensors aren't picking up
any life-forms.

60
00:02:41,314 --> 00:02:44,115
The particle field could be
interfering with the sensors.

61
00:02:44,153 --> 00:02:46,818
We better beam down
for a closer look.

62
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,415
I'm still getting
a lot of interference.

63
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,325
The particle field
must be blocking

64
00:03:05,362 --> 00:03:06,694
the tricorder functions.

65
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,535
The interference seems
to be coming from here.

66
00:03:16,718 --> 00:03:21,022
This must be the source
of the field.

67
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,521
It's probably some kind
of matter/antimatter reactor.

68
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:28,370
Lieutenant, I suggest we leave
before we're discovered.

69
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,740
Give me a minute.

70
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,585
Take all the time you want.

71
00:05:47,763 --> 00:05:50,029
It's about time.

72
00:05:50,068 --> 00:05:51,502
Enter.
Where have you been?

73
00:05:51,537 --> 00:05:53,005
I've been waiting hours...

74
00:05:55,312 --> 00:05:57,714
M-Major.

75
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,950
Uh, I'm sorry, we're closed.

76
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,983
You'll have to come back
in the morning.

77
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:04,793
Oh, I didn't come here
for a drink.

78
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,991
I thought you'd like to know

79
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:08,402
your cousin Kono just tried
to come aboard the station.

80
00:06:08,438 --> 00:06:10,499
Kono? Here?

81
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:12,033
What an unexpected pleasure.

82
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,104
He's gone, Quark.

83
00:06:13,148 --> 00:06:14,616
When we tried to talk to him

84
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,178
he beamed onto a departing
Tellarite freighter.

85
00:06:17,222 --> 00:06:18,520
There must be some mistake.

86
00:06:18,558 --> 00:06:20,026
Why would Kono be coming here?

87
00:06:20,062 --> 00:06:21,827
I was wondering the
same thing myself

88
00:06:21,864 --> 00:06:23,196
so, I did a little checking.

89
00:06:23,234 --> 00:06:24,327
Your cousin's wanted

90
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,340
for robbing a museum
on Cardassia V.

91
00:06:26,374 --> 00:06:29,175
My guess is he thought
someone here would help him

92
00:06:29,213 --> 00:06:30,238
sell the merchandise.

93
00:06:30,282 --> 00:06:32,184
Outrageous.
You have no proof of that.

94
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:35,248
Quark, get this into that
little twisted brain of yours.

95
00:06:35,292 --> 00:06:37,353
If you thought
you were going to get away

96
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,559
with anything while Odo's
gone, think again.

97
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,830
I'm watching you.

98
00:06:43,408 --> 00:06:45,571
Major?

99
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:48,708
You make it sound
like you don't like me.

100
00:06:48,752 --> 00:06:52,385
Don't like you?

101
00:06:52,426 --> 00:06:54,589
You collaborated
with the Cardassians.

102
00:06:54,697 --> 00:06:56,165
You cheat your customers

103
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,329
and you're a danger
to this station.

104
00:06:58,371 --> 00:07:01,639
I don't just "not like you."

105
00:07:01,677 --> 00:07:03,374
I despise you.

106
00:07:05,953 --> 00:07:09,791
Sorry I mentioned it.

107
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,530
A-A job?
What do I need a job for?

108
00:07:13,568 --> 00:07:14,934
You're 15 years old.

109
00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:17,943
It's time you took
a little responsibility.

110
00:07:20,248 --> 00:07:23,379
Look, Nog works, doesn't he?

111
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:24,719
Yeah.

112
00:07:24,757 --> 00:07:27,057
You're almost as old as he is.

113
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:29,463
When I was your age,
I had a job

114
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,063
and it was
a terrific experience.

115
00:07:32,105 --> 00:07:33,300
All right, I'll talk to Nog

116
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:35,869
and see if he can get me
a job at Quark's.

117
00:07:35,912 --> 00:07:38,907
Quark's? I was thinking
more along the lines

118
00:07:38,952 --> 00:07:41,218
of you helping out
Chief O'Brien.

119
00:07:41,257 --> 00:07:42,748
Chief O'Brien?

120
00:07:42,793 --> 00:07:45,526
You do like Chief O'Brien,
don't you?

121
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:49,232
He's okay, but I don't know
anything about engineering.

122
00:07:49,273 --> 00:07:52,109
This is the perfect
opportunity to learn.

123
00:07:52,145 --> 00:07:55,242
Besides, it'll look great
on your application

124
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:56,811
to Starfleet Academy.

125
00:08:01,097 --> 00:08:03,363
Okay, I'll give it a try.

126
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:05,998
That's all I ask.

127
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:13,847
Are we being accused
of some kind of crime?

128
00:08:13,888 --> 00:08:16,324
Have you committed one?

129
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,853
We've just arrived here.

130
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,561
So you keep saying.

131
00:08:20,602 --> 00:08:22,902
If you want,
you can check our ship's logs

132
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,500
and they'll prove it to you.

133
00:08:24,543 --> 00:08:26,240
Logs can be tampered with.

134
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,771
Well, you ought to know that.

135
00:08:27,816 --> 00:08:30,048
After all, you claim to be
a security officer.

136
00:08:30,088 --> 00:08:33,151
I am a security officer,
and I've had enough of this.

137
00:08:33,194 --> 00:08:36,291
If we were guilty, we wouldn't
even be here right now.

138
00:08:36,334 --> 00:08:37,359
I'll prove it.

139
00:08:37,402 --> 00:08:39,668
Computer, one to beam up.

140
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:51,225
Don't worry,
he'll be right back.

141
00:08:56,874 --> 00:08:58,342
What did I tell you?

142
00:08:58,378 --> 00:09:00,975
Now, that's interesting,
you disappearing like that

143
00:09:01,016 --> 00:09:02,645
because I've got 22 people

144
00:09:02,753 --> 00:09:04,985
who have disappeared
without a trace.

145
00:09:05,024 --> 00:09:09,260
22 missing people?

146
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,667
Did they all disappear
at the same time?

147
00:09:11,771 --> 00:09:13,934
No, it started in the fall.

148
00:09:13,975 --> 00:09:17,414
But the last victim vanished
six hours ago.

149
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:19,977
Six hours ago
we weren't even in this system.

150
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,583
If you want, you can accompany
us back to our station

151
00:09:22,626 --> 00:09:25,689
and they will verify
everything we've told you.

152
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,471
Do you have any other suspects?

153
00:09:33,514 --> 00:09:35,677
You were my only ones.

154
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:38,714
I'm not saying
everybody here is perfect.

155
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:42,925
We have some petty thefts,
an occasional fight, but...

156
00:09:42,966 --> 00:09:44,400
kidnapping, murder?

157
00:09:44,436 --> 00:09:46,372
Nah. Nah, we've never had

158
00:09:46,407 --> 00:09:48,536
anything like
that before.

159
00:09:48,578 --> 00:09:50,741
I see.

160
00:09:50,782 --> 00:09:51,943
So...

161
00:09:51,984 --> 00:09:53,475
have you scanned the area

162
00:09:53,521 --> 00:09:55,548
for signs of transporter
activity?

163
00:09:55,592 --> 00:09:57,494
It was the first thing I tried.

164
00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:59,522
I didn't find anything.

165
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:03,366
You know, I've been protector
here for almost ten years.

166
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:05,377
I like to think
I'm pretty good at my job.

167
00:10:05,411 --> 00:10:07,608
People trust me
to solve their problems.

168
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,915
But whoever's behind
these disappearances

169
00:10:09,953 --> 00:10:12,925
is a lot smarter than I am.

170
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,665
I have to admit,
I'm starting to get desperate.

171
00:10:18,704 --> 00:10:22,701
Maybe what you need
is a little help.

172
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,683
Maybe.

173
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:35,033
Rurigan.

174
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:43,019
So...

175
00:10:43,053 --> 00:10:45,684
these are the strangers
I heard about?

176
00:10:45,725 --> 00:10:48,356
Shouldn't they be in a cell?

177
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,631
I'm satisfied they have nothing
to do with the disappearances.

178
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,335
In fact, Odo here
is a security officer.

179
00:10:54,376 --> 00:10:56,369
He's going to try to help us.

180
00:10:56,413 --> 00:10:58,315
How do you plan to do that?

181
00:10:58,351 --> 00:11:01,255
I understand your daughter
is the latest victim.

182
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,556
When was the last time
you saw her?

183
00:11:03,594 --> 00:11:05,291
This morning at first meal.

184
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:09,829
But Taya said she saw her later
in her workroom around midday.

185
00:11:09,873 --> 00:11:11,000
Taya?

186
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:13,171
My granddaughter.

187
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:16,050
Colyus, Anetra's gone,
just like the others.

188
00:11:16,085 --> 00:11:18,055
We're never going to find them.

189
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:19,718
How can you be so sure?

190
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,789
Let's just say I haven't
been proven wrong yet.

191
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:25,200
I'd like to scan the area again
for transporter activity

192
00:11:25,238 --> 00:11:26,467
in case you missed something.

193
00:11:26,507 --> 00:11:28,739
Go right ahead.

194
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,051
I'm still not getting
a clear reading.

195
00:11:34,088 --> 00:11:36,821
The omicron particles
put out by the reactor

196
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,057
are creating
too much interference.

197
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,534
Oh, must be your equipment.

198
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,940
Our scanners
never give any trouble.

199
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,841
Certain kinds of transporters

200
00:11:48,884 --> 00:11:52,084
leave behind a residual
electrostatic charge.

201
00:11:52,124 --> 00:11:54,755
If we could check
Anetra's workroom?

202
00:12:00,073 --> 00:12:01,234
If you don't mind

203
00:12:01,276 --> 00:12:03,712
I'd like to talk
to your granddaughter.

204
00:12:03,748 --> 00:12:06,811
Well, the last time I saw her,
she was across the square.

205
00:12:06,854 --> 00:12:08,254
I'll take you to her.

206
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,849
Taya?

207
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:26,255
Don't be afraid, Taya.

208
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:28,558
This is a friend
of Protector Colyus.

209
00:12:28,597 --> 00:12:30,965
He just wants you to answer
a few questions.

210
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:33,995
Do I have to?

211
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,376
Not if you don't want to.

212
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:41,683
But it would help
if I could talk to you

213
00:12:41,723 --> 00:12:43,386
about your mother's
disappearance.

214
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,489
She hasn't disappeared.

215
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:48,662
She'll be back.

216
00:12:52,444 --> 00:12:56,009
The last time
you saw your mother

217
00:12:56,051 --> 00:12:59,684
did she seem upset
about anything?

218
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:02,356
Nervous, perhaps, or worried?

219
00:13:02,464 --> 00:13:04,229
She seemed fine.

220
00:13:06,238 --> 00:13:08,470
When will she be coming home?

221
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,912
I don't know, Taya.

222
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,081
Let's go;
it's past your bedtime.

223
00:13:15,122 --> 00:13:17,422
I'd like to ask
a few more questions.

224
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,600
It'll wait till morning.

225
00:13:44,915 --> 00:13:48,582
Chief, here's the new apprentice
we discussed.

226
00:13:48,623 --> 00:13:50,456
Yes, sir.
Welcome aboard.

227
00:13:55,136 --> 00:13:58,267
Well, let's get to work.

228
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:00,609
I was just about to run
a diagnostic

229
00:14:00,647 --> 00:14:02,378
on the primary system core.

230
00:14:02,418 --> 00:14:03,579
Mr. Sisko...

231
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,558
I almost forgot.

232
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:09,062
For you.

233
00:14:09,097 --> 00:14:10,429
Thanks, Dad.

234
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:14,601
It's standard equipment
for all station personnel.

235
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:30,237
Wait, let me get
this straight, Major.

236
00:14:30,272 --> 00:14:32,606
You want me to spy
on Quark for you?

237
00:14:32,644 --> 00:14:34,443
I wouldn't
call it spying, exactly.

238
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:37,477
I just thought you might,
you know, keep an eye on him

239
00:14:37,521 --> 00:14:38,750
while Odo's away.

240
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,122
When you're not busy.

241
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,286
Oh, it's no problem, Major.

242
00:14:41,328 --> 00:14:43,127
Then you'll do it?

243
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:44,133
I look forward to it.

244
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:46,137
Garak has been lecturing me
on surveillance techniques.

245
00:14:46,171 --> 00:14:48,004
This'll give me a chance
to try some of them out.

246
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,034
Sisko to Kira.

247
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,069
This is Kira.

248
00:14:51,114 --> 00:14:52,708
Major, I thought
you might like to know

249
00:14:52,751 --> 00:14:54,242
we've received word
that Vedek Bareil

250
00:14:54,287 --> 00:14:55,516
is coming aboard the station.

251
00:14:55,557 --> 00:14:56,855
Coming aboard... when?

252
00:14:56,893 --> 00:14:59,831
His ship just arrived
at Docking Bay 12.

253
00:15:08,483 --> 00:15:10,578
I wish you'd given us
a little more notice.

254
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,681
We could have arranged
a formal reception.

255
00:15:12,724 --> 00:15:15,787
Well, that's exactly
what I wanted to avoid.

256
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,960
What brings you to the station?

257
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:21,805
Prylar Rhit invited me
to speak at the station shrine.

258
00:15:21,843 --> 00:15:22,833
Ah.

259
00:15:22,878 --> 00:15:24,507
But to be honest, I...

260
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:28,318
I've been looking for
an opportunity to see you.

261
00:15:28,355 --> 00:15:29,653
Really?

262
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:32,424
I'm honored.

263
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:33,830
Oh, honored.

264
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:39,402
Uh, actually, I was hoping
you'd be happy to see me.

265
00:15:39,445 --> 00:15:41,881
Oh, I am.

266
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,715
Very happy.

267
00:16:11,876 --> 00:16:13,367
Hello, Taya.

268
00:16:18,723 --> 00:16:19,986
Remember me?

269
00:16:20,025 --> 00:16:21,961
We met last night.

270
00:16:21,996 --> 00:16:24,900
You wanted to ask me questions.

271
00:16:24,935 --> 00:16:26,028
That's right.

272
00:16:26,071 --> 00:16:27,665
About your mother.

273
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:32,707
I understand you were
the last one to see her.

274
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,388
I guess.

275
00:16:38,596 --> 00:16:40,327
What happened to your face?

276
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:45,164
Nothing happened to my face.

277
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:47,372
I'm a shape-shifter.

278
00:16:47,413 --> 00:16:51,478
I just don't do faces very well.

279
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:56,362
I have the ability
to change my shape

280
00:16:56,398 --> 00:16:58,493
to look like other things.

281
00:16:58,536 --> 00:17:01,064
You mean, you're a changeling?

282
00:17:01,107 --> 00:17:03,134
That's right.

283
00:17:03,178 --> 00:17:06,116
There's no such thing
as changelings.

284
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,882
They're make-believe.

285
00:17:07,921 --> 00:17:09,550
Everyone knows that.

286
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:13,588
Well, I'm not make-believe.

287
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:17,903
All right, then let me see
you change into something.

288
00:17:19,611 --> 00:17:20,806
Maybe later.

289
00:17:20,847 --> 00:17:25,915
Right now, I feel like talking.

290
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:29,954
If I were a changeling,
I'd change shapes all the time.

291
00:17:29,998 --> 00:17:32,765
Everyone would want
to be my friend.

292
00:17:32,804 --> 00:17:36,038
Ha. I wish it were that easy.

293
00:17:36,077 --> 00:17:37,842
Why wouldn't it be?

294
00:17:39,818 --> 00:17:41,481
When I was younger

295
00:17:41,521 --> 00:17:46,486
people were always asking me
to change shape for them.

296
00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:51,235
They'd pretend to be my friends,
but all they wanted

297
00:17:51,274 --> 00:17:54,839
was to see me become a chair
or an animal.

298
00:17:54,882 --> 00:17:58,481
None of them ever
really cared about me.

299
00:17:58,522 --> 00:18:01,426
Maybe they were scared of you.

300
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:05,598
Some of them probably were.

301
00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:08,573
I'm not afraid of you.

302
00:18:10,647 --> 00:18:12,708
I'm glad to hear that.

303
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,023
Were your parents
changelings, too?

304
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,793
I never knew my parents.

305
00:18:22,838 --> 00:18:25,969
I've been looking for them
for a long time.

306
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:32,947
My father died when I was four.

307
00:18:32,991 --> 00:18:35,359
I don't remember him very well.

308
00:18:37,066 --> 00:18:39,902
The last time I saw my mother

309
00:18:39,938 --> 00:18:45,644
she was in her workroom
making pottery.

310
00:18:45,683 --> 00:18:50,181
When I went to get her for
the midday meal, she was gone.

311
00:18:51,662 --> 00:18:55,363
How did she act
when you last saw her?

312
00:18:55,402 --> 00:18:58,135
Happy.

313
00:18:58,174 --> 00:19:02,410
She was making a vase
for Mr. Depnen, the baker.

314
00:19:02,449 --> 00:19:04,385
He really likes my mom

315
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,884
so he always saves us
the best loaf of greenbread.

316
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:13,166
Has your mother ever gone
anywhere before?

317
00:19:13,204 --> 00:19:14,494
A trip, vacation?

318
00:19:15,496 --> 00:19:17,125
We don't go on trips.

319
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,156
Never?

320
00:19:18,235 --> 00:19:22,802
No, we never leave the valley.

321
00:19:22,844 --> 00:19:24,039
Why not?

322
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,018
Nobody ever leaves the valley.

323
00:19:29,023 --> 00:19:30,822
Everything we need
is right here.

324
00:19:33,031 --> 00:19:34,694
I see.

325
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,641
My mother's never coming back,
is she?

326
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,115
Why do you say that?

327
00:19:45,724 --> 00:19:47,921
It's what my grandfather
told me.

328
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:56,204
Taya, I don't know
where your mother is

329
00:19:56,244 --> 00:20:00,446
but I promise you,
I'm going to do everything I can

330
00:20:00,486 --> 00:20:03,720
to find her
and bring her back to you.

331
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,044
Okay, one more time.

332
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,913
These are all isolinear rods.

333
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,786
The ones with the white labels
contain data

334
00:20:18,823 --> 00:20:21,727
relating to the engineering
systems controls

335
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,288
the red-labeled ones

336
00:20:23,398 --> 00:20:25,868
are for library
and information storage

337
00:20:25,904 --> 00:20:29,206
and the blue ones are?

338
00:20:29,243 --> 00:20:30,837
I'm never going to get this.

339
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,406
Give yourself some time.

340
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,181
I didn't get a handle
on this stuff

341
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,622
until almost a year
after I joined Starfleet.

342
00:20:36,658 --> 00:20:38,525
I mean, it's not
like you're going off

343
00:20:38,562 --> 00:20:40,532
to the Academy tomorrow, is it?

344
00:20:42,938 --> 00:20:44,065
What's wrong?

345
00:20:44,107 --> 00:20:45,268
Nothing.

346
00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:48,008
It's just that,
why does everyone assume

347
00:20:48,048 --> 00:20:50,075
that I'm going to the Academy?

348
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:52,750
Well, you want to go,
don't you?

349
00:20:55,062 --> 00:20:56,588
Not really.

350
00:20:58,903 --> 00:21:00,030
Does your father know?

351
00:21:00,072 --> 00:21:02,304
He wouldn't understand.

352
00:21:02,343 --> 00:21:04,040
I know how you feel.

353
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,519
You know what my father
wanted me to be?

354
00:21:07,553 --> 00:21:08,885
A musician.

355
00:21:10,092 --> 00:21:11,424
It's true.

356
00:21:11,461 --> 00:21:14,433
I was supposed to be
a cello player.

357
00:21:14,467 --> 00:21:16,835
He made me practice
every day.

358
00:21:16,872 --> 00:21:18,865
I got to be pretty good.

359
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,349
When I was 17, he sent
a recorded audition

360
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:25,080
to the Aldebaran Music Academy.

361
00:21:25,122 --> 00:21:26,351
What happened?

362
00:21:26,457 --> 00:21:27,720
Oh, I got in.

363
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,060
It was the happiest day
of his life.

364
00:21:30,098 --> 00:21:33,298
I didn't know how to tell him
I didn't want to go.

365
00:21:33,338 --> 00:21:35,740
So, two days before
I was due to leave

366
00:21:35,776 --> 00:21:38,714
I went into town
and signed up for Starfleet.

367
00:21:38,748 --> 00:21:40,479
What did your dad do?

368
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:41,987
Oh, he was furious.

369
00:21:42,022 --> 00:21:44,390
But once he calmed down
a little

370
00:21:44,493 --> 00:21:47,021
he saw how much
I wanted to join.

371
00:21:47,066 --> 00:21:50,402
Nowadays when I go home,
he introduces me as...

372
00:21:50,505 --> 00:21:52,805
"My son

373
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:58,082
Senior Chief Specialist
Miles Edward O'Brien."

374
00:21:58,121 --> 00:22:03,063
The point is, you've got
to live your own life.

375
00:22:03,098 --> 00:22:05,068
I don't want
to disappoint my dad.

376
00:22:05,102 --> 00:22:07,368
Hey, your dad's not a bad guy.

377
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:08,771
He'll come around.

378
00:22:08,808 --> 00:22:10,835
Just give him some time.

379
00:22:25,575 --> 00:22:28,138
So...

380
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:29,810
What did you think?

381
00:22:29,851 --> 00:22:31,251
Of your speech?

382
00:22:31,287 --> 00:22:33,348
Mm-hmm.

383
00:22:33,391 --> 00:22:35,691
I liked everything about it...

384
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,220
except the content.

385
00:22:37,266 --> 00:22:39,065
You disagree
with my interpretation

386
00:22:39,103 --> 00:22:40,332
of the Eighth Prophecy?

387
00:22:40,372 --> 00:22:43,105
"Disagree" is a bit
of an understatement.

388
00:22:43,144 --> 00:22:45,843
"Passionately disagree"
is more like it.

389
00:22:45,883 --> 00:22:47,785
The way you have
of taking a prophecy

390
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,313
and showing that it can mean
exactly the opposite

391
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:52,727
of the accepted
interpretation is...

392
00:22:52,763 --> 00:22:53,958
Oh, it's brilliant.

393
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,161
Uh... insightful.

394
00:22:55,202 --> 00:22:58,106
Infuriating.

395
00:22:58,141 --> 00:23:01,672
Maybe we should talk
about something else.

396
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,148
Like what?

397
00:23:03,184 --> 00:23:06,418
Well, the Ilvian
katterpod crop maybe?

398
00:23:06,491 --> 00:23:07,925
Or, uh...

399
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:11,422
the new nature preserve
in Hedrikspool Province.

400
00:23:11,501 --> 00:23:12,833
Hmm? No?

401
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:16,309
Maybe the standings in
the Springball Championship.

402
00:23:16,344 --> 00:23:17,835
You follow springball?

403
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,148
Religiously... if you'll
pardon the expression.

404
00:23:21,187 --> 00:23:23,089
I even used to play a little.

405
00:23:23,124 --> 00:23:24,456
Me, too.

406
00:23:24,493 --> 00:23:27,363
I had Chief O'Brien design
a springball holosuite program.

407
00:23:27,399 --> 00:23:28,833
Really?

408
00:23:28,868 --> 00:23:31,031
Let's go.

409
00:23:31,074 --> 00:23:33,101
You want to play springball?

410
00:23:33,144 --> 00:23:34,635
Why not?

411
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,484
Well, unless you have
a more pressing engagement.

412
00:23:38,588 --> 00:23:40,490
Not that I can think of.

413
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,857
Good.

414
00:23:41,894 --> 00:23:44,194
I could use the practice.

415
00:23:55,122 --> 00:24:01,363
From what I understand, you...
helped found this colony.

416
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,629
That's right.

417
00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:05,003
I'm the oldest one left.

418
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:07,979
This colony must be
very important to you.

419
00:24:08,014 --> 00:24:10,177
You helped found it,
you raised a family here.

420
00:24:10,218 --> 00:24:13,885
I'm very proud
of what we've accomplished.

421
00:24:13,925 --> 00:24:16,590
Then explain something to me.

422
00:24:16,631 --> 00:24:20,628
This colony is undergoing
a serious crisis.

423
00:24:20,672 --> 00:24:23,803
Your daughter is
among the missing.

424
00:24:23,845 --> 00:24:26,510
Yet, you hardly seem concerned.

425
00:24:26,584 --> 00:24:29,818
There is nothing I can do
to change things.

426
00:24:29,857 --> 00:24:31,850
I wish there were.

427
00:24:31,894 --> 00:24:35,060
Now, is there anything else,
or can I go?

428
00:24:35,101 --> 00:24:38,232
Are you sure you're all right?

429
00:24:38,274 --> 00:24:40,210
Why wouldn't I be?

430
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,545
You seem to be
in a great deal of pain.

431
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:44,485
Why do you say that?

432
00:24:46,857 --> 00:24:48,690
I can see it in your eyes.

433
00:24:48,728 --> 00:24:51,791
Perhaps you'd like
to sit here for a moment

434
00:24:51,834 --> 00:24:53,565
and rest.

435
00:24:53,605 --> 00:24:56,304
Well, it wouldn't do much good.

436
00:24:56,344 --> 00:24:58,405
You see, I'm dying.

437
00:24:58,448 --> 00:25:00,918
I'm sorry.

438
00:25:00,952 --> 00:25:02,979
Well, I've had a good life.

439
00:25:03,024 --> 00:25:04,789
No regrets.

440
00:25:04,827 --> 00:25:07,993
I wish I could see
my daughter once again.

441
00:25:08,034 --> 00:25:10,972
Now, if there are
no more questions...

442
00:25:13,177 --> 00:25:16,672
Actually, there is one thing
I've been wondering.

443
00:25:18,955 --> 00:25:20,652
How come...

444
00:25:20,692 --> 00:25:23,459
no one ever leaves the village?

445
00:25:23,498 --> 00:25:25,127
I haven't met anyone yet

446
00:25:25,168 --> 00:25:27,570
who's ever been
outside this valley.

447
00:25:27,606 --> 00:25:28,699
Any idea why?

448
00:25:28,741 --> 00:25:30,472
I suppose it's because

449
00:25:30,512 --> 00:25:32,982
people around here
don't like to travel.

450
00:25:33,016 --> 00:25:35,111
After all,
there's no place to go.

451
00:25:35,155 --> 00:25:36,920
How can you be so sure?

452
00:25:36,957 --> 00:25:39,291
Have you ever left the valley?

453
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,893
Now that you mention it...

454
00:25:41,934 --> 00:25:43,402
no.

455
00:25:43,438 --> 00:25:45,704
When I asked Colyus

456
00:25:45,742 --> 00:25:47,541
if he searched
outside the valley

457
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:50,015
for the missing people,
he looked surprised

458
00:25:50,051 --> 00:25:52,283
as if he'd never
thought of it before.

459
00:25:52,322 --> 00:25:53,620
I find that very peculiar.

460
00:25:53,725 --> 00:25:55,125
Where I come from

461
00:25:55,161 --> 00:25:58,099
we would have searched
the entire countryside.

462
00:25:58,134 --> 00:25:59,568
Yes.

463
00:25:59,603 --> 00:26:04,067
I suppose Colyus thought
there was no point to it.

464
00:26:04,113 --> 00:26:06,106
But I guarantee you...

465
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:09,554
there are no missing people
out there.

466
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,656
You're sure of that?

467
00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:13,884
Absolutely.

468
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:26,111
And then the great Minra said
to the evil changeling

469
00:26:26,152 --> 00:26:28,645
"Maybe you can turn
into a mountain

470
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:31,058
"or a Ghergher Beast
or a tornado

471
00:26:31,095 --> 00:26:34,626
"but those are big things,
and big things are easy.

472
00:26:34,668 --> 00:26:37,697
"I bet you can't turn
into something small

473
00:26:37,741 --> 00:26:39,802
like a loaf of greenbread."

474
00:26:39,845 --> 00:26:42,510
And the changeling
said, "Yes, I can"

475
00:26:42,551 --> 00:26:43,951
and he did.

476
00:26:43,987 --> 00:26:46,184
Then do you know what happened?

477
00:26:46,225 --> 00:26:49,026
The great Minra gobbled him up.

478
00:26:49,063 --> 00:26:50,965
How'd you know that?

479
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:54,030
The changeling in your story
wasn't very smart.

480
00:26:57,414 --> 00:27:00,250
Could you turn into a loaf
of greenbread?

481
00:27:01,756 --> 00:27:03,623
I suppose I could.

482
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:06,192
Show me.

483
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:09,636
And let you gobble me up?

484
00:27:09,672 --> 00:27:12,235
I don't think so.

485
00:27:16,953 --> 00:27:18,513
See that tree?

486
00:27:18,556 --> 00:27:20,685
Sometimes we go there to play.

487
00:27:20,727 --> 00:27:24,724
That's the furthest I've
ever been from the village.

488
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,100
Wait here.

489
00:27:26,137 --> 00:27:28,004
But I want to come see, too.

490
00:27:28,041 --> 00:27:29,339
Please, do as I say.

491
00:27:29,378 --> 00:27:31,814
Lieutenant,
would you come with me?

492
00:27:37,661 --> 00:27:40,895
I'm still not reading
any other life-forms

493
00:27:40,934 --> 00:27:43,497
and no indication
of any power source.

494
00:27:45,277 --> 00:27:47,042
Did you see that?

495
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:49,072
It, it just vanished!

496
00:27:49,117 --> 00:27:52,784
It happened just
as we passed those bushes.

497
00:27:55,463 --> 00:27:57,126
Taya.

498
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,503
Taya, don't come any closer!

499
00:28:02,544 --> 00:28:05,311
But I brought you
some Harrid berries.

500
00:28:26,124 --> 00:28:29,426
Odo says you know what happened
to the missing villagers.

501
00:28:29,531 --> 00:28:31,524
I think I do.

502
00:28:31,569 --> 00:28:33,630
It's a little
complicated to explain.

503
00:28:33,673 --> 00:28:36,201
It'd probably be easier
if I showed you.

504
00:28:36,245 --> 00:28:38,647
May I have your cloak?

505
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:40,151
My... my cloak?

506
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:41,278
Please.

507
00:28:41,322 --> 00:28:42,916
Well...

508
00:28:44,995 --> 00:28:46,988
Thank you.

509
00:28:51,342 --> 00:28:53,710
Now, stand back.

510
00:28:58,155 --> 00:28:59,681
I'm waiting.

511
00:28:59,725 --> 00:29:01,592
This may take a minute.

512
00:29:01,629 --> 00:29:04,192
I don't want to make a mistake.

513
00:29:10,313 --> 00:29:12,749
That was my favorite cloak!

514
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:15,277
Please, stay where you are.

515
00:29:29,418 --> 00:29:32,083
Are you saying
somebody used our reactor

516
00:29:32,123 --> 00:29:34,218
to transport the victims away?

517
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,353
No.

518
00:29:35,396 --> 00:29:36,864
It's not a transporter.

519
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:38,698
It's a holographic projector.

520
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:40,968
It creates an omicron
particle field

521
00:29:41,007 --> 00:29:42,874
and then manipulates the field

522
00:29:42,911 --> 00:29:44,505
to form physical objects
like your cloak.

523
00:29:44,581 --> 00:29:48,681
Well, what does this have to do
with the missing people?

524
00:29:51,161 --> 00:29:54,497
The people are made up
of omicron particles, too.

525
00:29:55,637 --> 00:29:58,666
You mean they're...

526
00:29:58,709 --> 00:30:00,235
holograms?

527
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:02,772
I'm afraid so.

528
00:30:02,817 --> 00:30:05,253
You see, the component
that controls

529
00:30:05,289 --> 00:30:07,691
the particle field...
it's breaking down

530
00:30:07,727 --> 00:30:10,163
and that's why people
are disappearing.

531
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:11,690
Well, that's ridiculous!

532
00:30:11,735 --> 00:30:13,932
Some of the victims
were my friends.

533
00:30:13,973 --> 00:30:15,567
One of them is my nephew.

534
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:16,578
If I'm right

535
00:30:16,612 --> 00:30:20,518
everyone and everything
in this village

536
00:30:20,553 --> 00:30:22,523
is a holographic projection.

537
00:30:22,557 --> 00:30:26,224
And I thought I was desperate
to find an answer.

538
00:30:26,264 --> 00:30:27,732
Listen to her, Colyus.

539
00:30:27,767 --> 00:30:30,135
I know this is difficult
to accept.

540
00:30:31,709 --> 00:30:35,547
It's going to take a whole lot
more than a vanishing cloak

541
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,555
to make me believe
I'm some kind of hologram.

542
00:30:38,589 --> 00:30:40,786
I'd be skeptical,
too, if I were you

543
00:30:40,827 --> 00:30:42,421
but we have further proof.

544
00:30:42,464 --> 00:30:44,195
What kind of proof?

545
00:30:46,472 --> 00:30:48,169
The holographic field ends

546
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:51,044
just outside this valley,
and earlier today

547
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,243
Taya tried to reach
past the edge

548
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:54,948
and her arm disappeared.

549
00:30:54,988 --> 00:30:56,651
Is she all right?

550
00:30:56,692 --> 00:30:57,660
She's fine.

551
00:30:57,694 --> 00:30:59,060
Her arm re-materialized

552
00:30:59,096 --> 00:31:01,430
as soon as she pulled it
back inside.

553
00:31:03,338 --> 00:31:05,706
Where exactly did this happen?

554
00:31:05,743 --> 00:31:07,838
We could show you if you'd like.

555
00:31:07,881 --> 00:31:10,181
I think you'd better.

556
00:31:16,532 --> 00:31:17,830
I'm sorry.

557
00:31:17,867 --> 00:31:19,393
Don't apologize.

558
00:31:19,438 --> 00:31:21,567
I should have seen it coming.

559
00:31:21,608 --> 00:31:24,512
Where did you learn
to play like that?

560
00:31:24,548 --> 00:31:29,115
My brothers and I used to play
at the Singha refugee camp.

561
00:31:29,156 --> 00:31:31,524
There wasn't much else to do.

562
00:31:31,562 --> 00:31:34,193
Yeah, I was at Relliketh.

563
00:31:36,237 --> 00:31:38,070
And, uh, now...

564
00:31:38,108 --> 00:31:40,408
uh, here we are.

565
00:31:43,017 --> 00:31:45,545
Well, uh, uh, that, uh...

566
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,423
that was delicious.

567
00:31:48,462 --> 00:31:50,159
Well...

568
00:31:50,198 --> 00:31:52,065
thank the replicator.

569
00:31:54,073 --> 00:31:55,234
Here, let me help.

570
00:31:55,275 --> 00:31:56,641
That's not necessary.

571
00:31:56,678 --> 00:31:57,703
Your shoulder...

572
00:31:57,747 --> 00:31:59,478
Never felt better.

573
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,255
Maybe I do need
some help after all.

574
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,683
I'll have to remember
to thank Prylar Rhit

575
00:32:18,756 --> 00:32:20,282
for inviting you here.

576
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:25,792
You'd better tell him soon.

577
00:32:25,837 --> 00:32:27,830
Prylar Rhit...

578
00:32:27,874 --> 00:32:31,335
is going to be
returning to Bajor.

579
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,945
It appears he fancies
himself something...

580
00:32:34,988 --> 00:32:36,548
of a dabo player.

581
00:32:36,592 --> 00:32:38,060
Oh... really?

582
00:32:38,094 --> 00:32:39,392
Mm-hmm.

583
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,730
He's run up a...

584
00:32:41,802 --> 00:32:44,136
sizable gambling debt.

585
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,639
It's caused...

586
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,277
quite a scandal
in the Vedek assembly.

587
00:32:54,694 --> 00:32:56,994
Let me get this straight...

588
00:32:57,032 --> 00:33:01,200
the man who invited you
here to the station...

589
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,403
owes money... to Quark?

590
00:33:03,444 --> 00:33:04,571
To who?

591
00:33:04,614 --> 00:33:05,460
The little troll
who runs the dabo tables?

592
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:07,725
The little troll
who runs the dabo tables?

593
00:33:07,764 --> 00:33:09,232
I got to go.

594
00:33:09,267 --> 00:33:10,530
But why?

595
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,369
I need to talk to Prylar Rhit.

596
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:15,707
I think I know the real reason
he invited you here.

597
00:33:21,157 --> 00:33:22,523
People, please!

598
00:33:22,561 --> 00:33:23,995
Please!

599
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,020
Quiet!

600
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:29,868
Quiet!

601
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:31,399
Calm down!

602
00:33:31,512 --> 00:33:32,844
Quiet!

603
00:33:32,881 --> 00:33:33,906
Calm down, everybody.

604
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,579
We have to make a decision here.

605
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,954
Colyus, you should be out
looking for my wife

606
00:33:37,991 --> 00:33:39,585
and all the others
who are missing!

607
00:33:39,628 --> 00:33:40,618
Not wasting time

608
00:33:40,663 --> 00:33:42,394
listening to these strangers
and their lies.

609
00:33:42,433 --> 00:33:44,300
You all witnessed what happened

610
00:33:44,337 --> 00:33:47,070
when they brought us
to the edge of the field.

611
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:49,443
Merruk, we both saw
your hand disappear.

612
00:33:49,548 --> 00:33:51,142
It could have been a trick.

613
00:33:51,184 --> 00:33:53,051
It wasn't a trick.

614
00:33:53,088 --> 00:33:55,354
Then how come we've never
learned of this before?

615
00:33:55,392 --> 00:33:58,296
Because none of you ever tried
to leave the valley.

616
00:33:58,331 --> 00:34:01,896
It's possible
we were programmed not to leave

617
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:04,409
so that we wouldn't
learn the truth.

618
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:07,279
Now, we have
to shut down the system.

619
00:34:07,316 --> 00:34:12,315
If we don't fix it soon,
the whole village will disappear

620
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:13,919
Dax...

621
00:34:13,963 --> 00:34:16,992
you said if you can
fix the machine

622
00:34:17,036 --> 00:34:21,534
you might be able to bring back
the missing people.

623
00:34:21,578 --> 00:34:23,411
We hope so.

624
00:34:23,448 --> 00:34:25,213
What if you turn off
the projector

625
00:34:25,252 --> 00:34:26,846
and you can't get it back on?

626
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:30,522
Then this village
will cease to exist.

627
00:34:33,134 --> 00:34:35,297
The system's
only a few months away

628
00:34:35,338 --> 00:34:37,205
from complete failure anyway.

629
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:40,476
At least this way, we have
a chance to save you.

630
00:34:40,549 --> 00:34:43,112
Grandfather, please.

631
00:34:43,154 --> 00:34:47,060
Let her try.

632
00:34:47,096 --> 00:34:48,963
What do you think?

633
00:34:50,636 --> 00:34:53,004
Well, we can't go on like this.

634
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:56,172
I guess we should
let her shut it down.

635
00:34:56,214 --> 00:34:58,411
Are there any objections?

636
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:03,089
Then it's settled.

637
00:35:03,128 --> 00:35:05,964
I can't wait to see my mother.

638
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,809
Your face isn't so scary...

639
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:15,580
once you get used to it.

640
00:35:18,391 --> 00:35:20,327
Thank you, Taya.

641
00:35:27,944 --> 00:35:30,107
All right, here we go.

642
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,211
Odo...

643
00:35:48,251 --> 00:35:50,414
Don't look so surprised.

644
00:35:50,455 --> 00:35:52,482
I'm as real as you are.

645
00:36:00,342 --> 00:36:03,907
I was happy living
on Yadera Prime.

646
00:36:03,949 --> 00:36:07,012
That is,
until the Dominion took over

647
00:36:07,055 --> 00:36:09,891
and changed
our whole way of life.

648
00:36:09,928 --> 00:36:12,330
And I realized one morning

649
00:36:12,366 --> 00:36:16,067
that I didn't really
belong there anymore.

650
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:17,906
So I came here.

651
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:22,140
And I used a hologenerator

652
00:36:22,185 --> 00:36:26,125
to recreate all the things
that I'd lost.

653
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,123
I have lived here in my village
for nearly 30 years.

654
00:36:30,168 --> 00:36:33,572
And I've watched
the people marry...

655
00:36:33,641 --> 00:36:36,043
have children...

656
00:36:38,251 --> 00:36:39,583
grow old...

657
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:44,153
and sometimes I even forgot
that they were holograms.

658
00:36:45,933 --> 00:36:48,700
But it's over.

659
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:51,232
It's over.

660
00:36:51,277 --> 00:36:53,144
And I would appreciate it

661
00:36:53,181 --> 00:36:55,982
if you'd take me back
to Yadera Prime.

662
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,115
But what about the villagers?

663
00:36:58,157 --> 00:37:00,423
What about your granddaughter?

664
00:37:00,462 --> 00:37:02,557
She's not real.

665
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:05,366
Technically,
I suppose you're right.

666
00:37:05,405 --> 00:37:08,070
Maybe, by our definition,
Taya's not real.

667
00:37:08,111 --> 00:37:10,581
Her memories are stored
in a computer.

668
00:37:10,648 --> 00:37:13,381
Her body is made up
of omicron particles.

669
00:37:13,421 --> 00:37:16,359
But who's to say
that our definition of life

670
00:37:16,394 --> 00:37:17,862
is the only valid one?

671
00:37:17,897 --> 00:37:21,301
I'm sure if you asked her,
she'd say she was real.

672
00:37:21,337 --> 00:37:24,309
She thinks, she feels.

673
00:37:24,343 --> 00:37:27,372
She only seems to.

674
00:37:27,416 --> 00:37:30,445
It's all an illusion.

675
00:37:30,488 --> 00:37:32,185
An illusion I created.

676
00:37:32,225 --> 00:37:34,753
Well, you said you created
the village 30 years ago.

677
00:37:34,798 --> 00:37:35,925
Taya's only ten.

678
00:37:35,966 --> 00:37:37,366
I designed the program

679
00:37:37,402 --> 00:37:39,634
so the villagers
could have children

680
00:37:39,673 --> 00:37:40,834
if they wanted to.

681
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:43,746
Then Taya's personality
is a combination

682
00:37:43,782 --> 00:37:45,581
of her parents' personalities.

683
00:37:45,618 --> 00:37:46,984
Just like a real child.

684
00:37:47,022 --> 00:37:48,821
You had nothing to do with it.

685
00:37:48,859 --> 00:37:50,795
But she's still a hologram.

686
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:52,264
Maybe...

687
00:37:52,299 --> 00:37:53,597
but I saw the way

688
00:37:53,634 --> 00:37:55,763
you held her hand
when she was sad.

689
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:58,072
I saw the way
you tried to comfort her

690
00:37:58,111 --> 00:37:59,602
when she was frightened.

691
00:38:02,652 --> 00:38:05,088
I... I didn't want her
to get hurt.

692
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:08,154
If she's not real,
what does it matter?

693
00:38:08,197 --> 00:38:09,631
It matters.

694
00:38:09,666 --> 00:38:10,929
It matters to me.

695
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:14,876
Why should it matter to you
if a hologram cries?

696
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:20,682
Because I love her.

697
00:38:23,661 --> 00:38:26,258
And she loves you.

698
00:38:27,702 --> 00:38:29,136
Don't you see?

699
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:30,664
She's real to you.

700
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:32,644
And she's real to me, too.

701
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:34,205
They're all real.

702
00:38:34,249 --> 00:38:37,221
And you can't
turn your back on them now.

703
00:38:52,652 --> 00:38:53,950
Jake, how was work?

704
00:38:53,989 --> 00:38:55,218
Okay.

705
00:38:55,258 --> 00:38:58,230
It's kind of fun
working with Chief O'Brien.

706
00:38:58,264 --> 00:39:01,395
But it would be better
if I knew what I was doing.

707
00:39:01,437 --> 00:39:02,666
You'll get there.

708
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,538
I guess so.

709
00:39:05,578 --> 00:39:08,141
I'm glad you decided
to stick with it.

710
00:39:08,184 --> 00:39:11,520
Yeah.

711
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,550
Dad...

712
00:39:17,235 --> 00:39:19,671
I don't want to join Starfleet.

713
00:39:28,391 --> 00:39:29,985
Since when?

714
00:39:30,028 --> 00:39:32,225
S-since forever.

715
00:39:32,265 --> 00:39:36,171
Starfleet is too much like you.

716
00:39:36,206 --> 00:39:39,701
I need to find what's me.

717
00:39:39,746 --> 00:39:42,046
Does that make any sense?

718
00:39:42,085 --> 00:39:45,216
Perfect sense.

719
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,487
It does?

720
00:39:49,232 --> 00:39:51,225
It's your life, Jake.

721
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:53,502
You have to choose your own way.

722
00:39:53,541 --> 00:39:57,276
There is only one thing
I want from you.

723
00:39:57,315 --> 00:40:02,781
Find something you love
then do it the best you can.

724
00:40:02,892 --> 00:40:04,437
I'll try.

725
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,970
Good.

726
00:40:06,007 --> 00:40:09,070
Then you'll make
the old man proud.

727
00:40:10,315 --> 00:40:11,715
I'd better go study.

728
00:40:11,751 --> 00:40:15,418
I'm still trying to figure out
those isolinear rods.

729
00:40:29,988 --> 00:40:31,548
Hello, Quark.

730
00:40:32,826 --> 00:40:34,021
Major.

731
00:40:34,063 --> 00:40:36,694
To what do I owe this
unexpected pleasure?

732
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,795
I just thought
I'd let you know...

733
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:39,965
we caught your cousin

734
00:40:40,008 --> 00:40:42,001
trying to slip back
onto this station

735
00:40:42,046 --> 00:40:45,314
and guess what we
confiscated from him?

736
00:40:45,352 --> 00:40:47,720
Bone carvings.

737
00:40:47,756 --> 00:40:50,319
Stolen from a museum
on Cardassia V.

738
00:40:50,362 --> 00:40:52,389
I always knew
Kono was no good.

739
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:54,835
I only wish
we could have caught

740
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,772
the two of you together.

741
00:40:56,808 --> 00:40:59,678
Life is full
of disappointments.

742
00:40:59,714 --> 00:41:01,684
By the way,
Prylar Rhit tells me

743
00:41:01,718 --> 00:41:03,244
that you encouraged him

744
00:41:03,288 --> 00:41:05,656
to invite Bareil
onto this station.

745
00:41:06,996 --> 00:41:08,362
That a crime?

746
00:41:08,398 --> 00:41:10,095
Not at all.

747
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:12,628
I just wanted to thank you.

748
00:41:12,673 --> 00:41:14,506
I found him very...

749
00:41:16,147 --> 00:41:17,673
diverting.

750
00:41:29,907 --> 00:41:33,642
Not diverting enough.

751
00:41:36,554 --> 00:41:38,353
All right,
nothing to do now

752
00:41:38,391 --> 00:41:41,488
but reactivate the system
and see what happens.

753
00:41:41,531 --> 00:41:42,692
Wait.

754
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:45,261
Lieutenant, I'd like
to ask a favor.

755
00:41:45,305 --> 00:41:48,141
If this works,
please don't tell the others

756
00:41:48,178 --> 00:41:49,772
that I'm... not like them.

757
00:41:49,814 --> 00:41:53,345
I don't want to be treated
any differently than before.

758
00:41:55,959 --> 00:41:57,861
Of course.

759
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:24,912
Mother?
Mother?

760
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,943
Mother!

761
00:42:34,103 --> 00:42:36,403
Well, you did it.

762
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,103
We upgraded the
system's memory core

763
00:42:38,144 --> 00:42:39,807
and realigned
the field generators.

764
00:42:39,847 --> 00:42:41,008
I don't think

765
00:42:41,049 --> 00:42:43,042
you'll have to worry
about anyone disappearing now.

766
00:42:43,087 --> 00:42:45,080
We just have to get used
to the fact

767
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:46,320
that we're holograms.

768
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,762
We're alive and we have
our families back.

769
00:42:48,798 --> 00:42:50,700
That's the only
thing that counts.

770
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:52,432
I wonder who created all this?

771
00:42:52,472 --> 00:42:56,378
Whoever it was,
did a fine job.

772
00:42:56,414 --> 00:42:57,974
They did, didn't they?

773
00:42:58,016 --> 00:43:00,783
Well, it was good
working with you, Odo.

774
00:43:00,822 --> 00:43:03,817
Next time you're
on this side of the galaxy

775
00:43:03,862 --> 00:43:05,957
I hope you come by
and see us.

776
00:43:05,999 --> 00:43:08,060
I would like that.

777
00:43:08,104 --> 00:43:10,438
We don't get
that many visitors.

778
00:43:12,512 --> 00:43:13,775
Odo.

779
00:43:15,285 --> 00:43:16,776
My mother's back.

780
00:43:16,821 --> 00:43:18,050
I'm glad.

781
00:43:19,827 --> 00:43:21,888
You're leaving.

782
00:43:21,931 --> 00:43:23,696
I'm afraid so.

783
00:43:25,472 --> 00:43:26,998
I'll miss you.

784
00:43:33,121 --> 00:43:35,353
I'll miss you, too.

785
00:43:37,129 --> 00:43:39,999
Thank you for bringing
my mother back.

786
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,631
I hope you find
your parents, too.

787
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:48,207
Thank you, Taya.

788
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:49,617
So do I.

789
00:44:07,489 --> 00:44:08,718
Taya...

790
00:44:24,356 --> 00:44:26,349
Computer, two to beam up.
