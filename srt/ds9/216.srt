1
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:07,382
DAX:
<i>Science Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 47603.3.</i>

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,926
<i>Commander Sisko has assigned me</i>

3
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:10,845
<i>to investigate an unusual</i>
<i>particle field</i>

4
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:13,138
<i>detected on the other side</i>
<i>of the wormhole.</i>

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,015
<i>Odo has come along</i>
<i>to the Gamma Quadrant</i>

6
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:18,226
<i>hoping to find clues</i>
<i>to his origin.</i>

7
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,521
So you see, Ensign Manwaring
has spent the last two weeks

8
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,439
avoiding the Assay Office
because he thought

9
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,650
that Freyla was in love
with Lieutenant Strek

10
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:27,194
but all the while, Strek was
seeing Security Officer Seelee.

11
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,571
And Freyla was waiting for
Manwaring to ask her out.

12
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:32,533
Officer Seelee has seemed
distracted at work lately.

13
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,202
I'm going to have to talk
to her about this

14
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:37,204
when we get back
to the station.

15
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,373
Odo, I didn't tell you
that story

16
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,500
to get Seelee
in trouble.

17
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,002
Frankly, Lieutenant,

18
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:46,045
I fail to see any point
in your story at all

19
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,089
except perhaps
to illustrate

20
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,718
the foolish humanoid
preoccupation

21
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,386
with romantic coupling.

22
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,762
The point is

23
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,015
that sometimes
we don't see true love

24
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,726
even when it's staring us
right in the face.

25
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:02,229
How fascinating.

26
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,690
Let me give you another example.

27
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,400
You know Lysia Arlin?

28
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:09,528
The Bolian woman
who runs the<i> jumja</i> kiosk.

29
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,988
I've noticed

30
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,698
she's been making
a lot of visits

31
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,282
to the security office lately.

32
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,784
She has a cousin

33
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:18,662
who's interested in a career
in law enforcement.

34
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,247
You don't say.

35
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,124
Are you implying

36
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,420
that Lysia Arlin
is interested in me?

37
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,799
Ridiculous.

38
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:32,801
I would have noticed.

39
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,469
Exactly my point.

40
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,932
You must be mistaken.

41
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:40,434
And how can
you be so sure?

42
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:44,646
Because women don't react
to me in that manner.

43
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:47,942
Are you saying that you've
never had a female friend?

44
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,903
I consider Major Kira a friend.

45
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:53,363
That's not what I meant.

46
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,449
I'm talking about...

47
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,618
an intimate friendship.

48
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,789
That's a very personal question.

49
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,791
I'm sorry, but after
seven lifetimes

50
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,585
the impersonal questions
aren't much fun anymore.

51
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,253
(<i> huffs</i> )

52
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:11,131
Looks like we found
our particle field.

53
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,551
They're omicron particles.

54
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,177
Is that unusual?

55
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,597
Omicron particles
are incredibly rare.

56
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,057
They can only be created

57
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:23,018
by certain types of
matter/antimatter reactions.

58
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,436
The field seems
to be coming

59
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,022
from the second planet
in the system.

60
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,607
Let's go in a little closer.

61
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,278
That's strange.

62
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,491
The particles are concentrated
in one small valley.

63
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:41,328
Sensors aren't picking up
any life-forms.

64
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,956
The particle field could be
interfering with the sensors.

65
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:44,957
We better beam down

66
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,667
for a closer look.

67
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,308
I'm still getting
a lot of interference.

68
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,310
The particle field
must be blocking

69
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,561
the tricorder functions.

70
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:14,361
The interference seems
to be coming from here.

71
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:21,076
This must be the source
of the field.

72
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:24,496
It's probably some kind
of matter/antimatter reactor.

73
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,665
Lieutenant, I
suggest we leave

74
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,333
before we're discovered.

75
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,584
Give me a minute.

76
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:39,386
Take all the time you want.

77
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,889
(<i> door chime</i> )

78
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,225
It's about time.

79
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,810
Enter.
Where have you been?

80
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,270
I've been waiting hours...

81
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,066
M-Major.

82
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,152
Uh, I'm sorry

83
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,486
we're closed.

84
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,446
You'll have to come back
in the morning.

85
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,073
Oh, I didn't come
here for a drink.

86
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,867
I thought you'd
like to know

87
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,827
your cousin Kono just tried
to come aboard the station.

88
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,954
Kono? Here?

89
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,289
What an unexpected pleasure.

90
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:13,456
He's gone, Quark.

91
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,000
When we tried
to talk to him

92
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,544
he beamed onto a departing
Tellarite freighter.

93
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,962
There must be some mistake.

94
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,505
Why would Kono be coming here?

95
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,341
I was wondering the
same thing myself,

96
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,466
so I did a
little checking.

97
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,759
Your cousin's wanted

98
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,887
for robbing a museum
on Cardassia V.

99
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,348
My guess is he thought
someone here would help him

100
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:30,598
sell the merchandise.

101
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,309
Outrageous. You have
no proof of that.

102
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:33,601
Quark, get this

103
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,520
into that little
twisted brain of yours.

104
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,647
If you thought
you were going to get away

105
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,941
with anything while Odo's
gone, think again.

106
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,069
I'm watching you.

107
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,073
Major?

108
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,115
You make it sound

109
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,117
like you don't like me.

110
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:52,704
Don't like you?

111
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,082
You collaborated
with the Cardassians.

112
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,624
You cheat your customers

113
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,543
and you're a danger
to this station.

114
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:02,047
I don't just "not like you."

115
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,548
I despise you.

116
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:10,055
Sorry I mentioned it.

117
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,892
A-A job? What do I need
a job for?

118
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,352
You're 15 years old.

119
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:18,230
It's time you took a
little responsibility.

120
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,735
Look, Nog works, doesn't he?

121
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,070
Yeah. 

122
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,281
You're almost
as old as he is.

123
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,699
When I was your
age, I had a job

124
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:32,244
and it was a terrific
experience.

125
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:33,745
All right, I'll talk to Nog

126
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,206
and see if he can get me
a job at Quark's.

127
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:39,209
Quark's? I was thinking
more along the lines

128
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:41,420
of you helping out
Chief O'Brien.

129
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,963
Chief O'Brien?

130
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,924
You do like Chief O'Brien,
don't you?

131
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:49,636
He's okay, but I don't know
anything about engineering.

132
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,431
This is the perfect
opportunity to learn.

133
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,475
Besides, it'll look great
on your application

134
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,018
to Starfleet Academy.

135
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,650
Okay, I'll give it a try.

136
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,320
That's all I ask.

137
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,328
Are we being accused
of some kind of crime?

138
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,496
Have you committed one?

139
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:19,291
We've just
arrived here.

140
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,792
So you keep saying.

141
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,295
If you want,
you can check our ship's logs

142
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,838
and they'll prove it to you.

143
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,506
Logs can be tampered with.

144
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,091
Well, you ought to know that.

145
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,427
After all, you claim to be
a security officer.

146
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,388
I<i> am</i> a security officer,
and I've had enough of this.

147
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,639
If we were guilty

148
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,516
we wouldn't even be here
right now.

149
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,642
I'll prove it.

150
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,853
Computer,
one to beam up.

151
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,531
Don't worry,
he'll be right back.

152
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,746
What did I tell you?

153
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,333
Now, that's interesting,
you disappearing like that

154
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,084
because I've got 22 people

155
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,212
who have disappeared
without a trace.

156
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:09,716
22 missing people?

157
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,135
Did they all disappear
at the same time?

158
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,304
No, it started in the fall.

159
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:17,891
But the last victim vanished
six hours ago.

160
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,352
Six hours ago
we weren't even in this system.

161
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,812
If you want, you can accompany
us back to our station

162
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:26,024
and they will verify
everything we've told you.

163
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,736
(<i> sighing</i> )

164
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:33,781
Do you have any other suspects?

165
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,909
You were my only ones.

166
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,079
I'm not saying
everybody here is perfect.

167
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,706
We have some petty thefts,
an occasional fight, but...

168
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,625
this kidnapping, murder?

169
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,545
Nah. Nah, we've never had

170
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,838
anything like
that before.

171
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,091
I see.

172
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,384
So...

173
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:53,760
have you scanned the area

174
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,887
for signs of transporter
activity?

175
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,556
It was the first thing I tried.

176
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,934
I didn't
find anything.
(<i> sighs</i> )

177
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,644
You know, I've been
protector here
for almost ten years.

178
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,646
I like to think
I'm pretty good
at my job.

179
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,774
People trust me
to solve their problems.

180
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,277
But whoever's behind
these disappearances

181
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,196
is a lot smarter
than I am.

182
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:18,952
I have to admit,
I'm starting to get desperate.

183
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:22,830
Maybe what you need
is a little help.

184
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,793
Maybe.

185
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,218
Rurigan.

186
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,310
So...

187
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,895
these are the strangers
I heard about?

188
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:48,731
Shouldn't they be in a cell?

189
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,776
I'm satisfied they have nothing
to do with the disappearances.

190
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,695
In fact, Odo here
is a security officer.

191
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,531
He's going to try to help us.

192
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,617
How do you plan
to do that?

193
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,536
I understand your daughter
is the latest victim.

194
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,830
When was the last
time you saw her?

195
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,540
This morning at first meal.

196
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,584
But Taya said she saw her later

197
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:10,003
in her workroom
around midday.

198
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,004
Taya?

199
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,340
My granddaughter.

200
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,673
Colyus,

201
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,301
Anetra's gone,
just like the others.

202
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,470
We're never going
to find them.

203
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,138
How can you be so sure?

204
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,390
Let's just say I haven't
been proven wrong yet.

205
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:25,059
I'd like to scan the area again
for transporter activity

206
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,727
in case you missed something.

207
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,855
Go right ahead.

208
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:34,319
I'm still not getting
a clear reading.

209
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,030
The omicron particles
put out by the reactor

210
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,407
are creating too
much interference.

211
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,742
Oh, must be
your equipment.

212
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,079
Our scanners never
give any trouble.

213
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,083
Certain kinds of transporters

214
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,295
leave behind a residual
electrostatic charge.

215
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,839
If we could check
Anetra's workroom?

216
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,720
If you don't mind

217
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,015
I'd like to talk to
your granddaughter.

218
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,559
Well, the last time
I saw her

219
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,101
she was across
the square.

220
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,520
I'll take you to her.

221
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,368
Taya?

222
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,080
Don't be afraid, Taya.

223
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,457
This is a friend
of Protector Colyus.

224
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,834
He just wants you to answer
a few questions.

225
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:34,753
Do I have to?

226
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:38,341
Not if you don't want to.

227
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,009
But it would help

228
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,512
if I could talk
to you

229
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,305
about your mother's
disappearance.

230
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,392
She hasn't disappeared.

231
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,436
She'll be back.

232
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,735
The last time
you saw your mother

233
00:12:56,775 --> 00:13:00,614
did she seem upset
about anything?

234
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,408
Nervous, perhaps, or worried?

235
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,951
She seemed fine.

236
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,247
When will she be coming home?

237
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,791
I don't know, Taya.

238
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,836
Let's go; it's
past your bedtime.

239
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,172
I'd like to ask
a few more questions.

240
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,386
It'll wait till morning.

241
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,827
Chief, here's the new apprentice
we discussed.

242
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,789
Yes, sir.
Welcome aboard.

243
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,672
Well, let's get to work.

244
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,881
I was just about to run
a diagnostic

245
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,717
on the primary system core.

246
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,968
Mr. Sisko...

247
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,929
I almost forgot.

248
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,307
For you.

249
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,684
Thanks, Dad.

250
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,227
It's standard
equipment

251
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,021
for all station personnel.

252
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,620
Wait, let me get
this straight, Major.

253
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,872
You want me to spy
on Quark for you?

254
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,957
I wouldn't
call it spying, exactly.

255
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,752
I just thought you might,
you know, keep an eye on him

256
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,086
while Odo's away.

257
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,380
When you're not busy.

258
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,506
Oh, it's no
problem, Major.

259
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:42,716
Then you'll do it?

260
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:43,758
I look forward to it.

261
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,925
Garak has been
lecturing me

262
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,511
on surveillance
techniques.

263
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,388
This'll give me a chance
to try some of them out.

264
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,056
SISKO:<i> Sisko to Kira.</i>

265
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,432
This is Kira.

266
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,142
<i>Major, I thought</i>
<i>you might like to know</i>

267
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,686
<i>we've received word</i>
<i>that Vedek Bareil</i>

268
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:55,770
<i>is coming aboard the station.</i>

269
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,271
Coming aboard-- when?

270
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,982
<i>His ship just arrived</i>
<i>at Docking Bay 12.</i>

271
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,077
I wish you'd given us
a little more notice.

272
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,246
We could have arranged
a formal reception.

273
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,082
Well, that's exactly
what I wanted to avoid.

274
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,376
What brings you
to the station?

275
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:22,171
Prylar Rhit invited me
to speak at the station shrine.

276
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,256
Ah.

277
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,007
But to be honest, I...

278
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:28,553
I've been looking for
an opportunity to see you.

279
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,054
Really?

280
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:32,724
I'm honored.

281
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,392
Oh, honored.

282
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:39,647
Uh, actually, I was hoping
you'd be<i> happy</i> to see me.

283
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,233
Oh, I am.

284
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,110
Very happy.

285
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,723
Hello, Taya.

286
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,438
Remember me?

287
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,440
We met last night.

288
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,234
You wanted to ask me questions.

289
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,444
That's right.

290
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,028
About your mother.

291
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,990
I understand

292
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,117
you were the last one
to see her.

293
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,703
I guess.

294
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,625
What happened to your face?

295
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,546
Nothing<i> happened</i> to my face.

296
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,841
I'm a shape-shifter.

297
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:51,803
I just don't do faces very well.

298
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,808
I have the ability
to change my shape

299
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,935
to look like other things.

300
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,395
You mean, you're a changeling?

301
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,564
That's right.

302
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,526
There's no such thing
as changelings.

303
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,277
They're make-believe.

304
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,821
Everyone knows that.

305
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:14,074
Well, I'm not make-believe.

306
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:18,120
All right, then let me see
you change into something.

307
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,165
Maybe later.

308
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:26,295
Right now, I feel
like talking.

309
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,006
If I were
a changeling

310
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,257
I'd change shapes
all the time.

311
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,135
Everyone would want
to be my friend.

312
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:36,389
Ha. I wish it were that easy.

313
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,265
Why wouldn't it be?

314
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,895
When I was younger

315
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:46,900
people were always asking me
to change shape for them.

316
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:51,571
They'd pretend to be my friends,
but all they wanted

317
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:55,324
was to see me become a chair
or an animal.

318
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:58,953
None of them ever
really cared about me.

319
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,789
Maybe they were scared of you.

320
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,002
Some of them probably were.

321
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:08,963
I'm not afraid of you.

322
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:13,133
I'm glad to hear that.

323
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,263
Were your parents
changelings, too?

324
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:23,310
I never knew my parents.

325
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,188
I've been looking for them
for a long time.

326
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:33,320
My father died when I was four.

327
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,656
I don't remember him very well.

328
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,244
The last time
I saw my mother

329
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,622
she was in
her workroom

330
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:46,084
making pottery.

331
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,962
When I went to get her
for the midday meal

332
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,421
she was gone.

333
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,551
How did she act
when you last saw her?

334
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:58,429
Happy.

335
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:02,934
She was making a vase
for Mr. Depnen, the baker.

336
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,811
He really likes my mom

337
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:09,231
so he always saves us
the best loaf of grain bread.

338
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:13,611
Has your mother ever gone
anywhere before?

339
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,237
A trip, vacation?

340
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,032
We don't go on trips.

341
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,241
Never?

342
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:23,621
No, we never leave
the valley.

343
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,039
Why not?

344
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,917
Nobody ever leaves
the valley.

345
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,211
Everything we need
is right here.

346
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,382
I see.

347
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,597
My mother's never coming back,
is she?

348
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:44,017
Why do you say that?

349
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,771
It's what
my grandfather told me.

350
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:57,071
Taya, I don't know
where your mother is

351
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,614
but I promise you

352
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:01,283
I'm going to do everything I can

353
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,495
to find her and bring her back
to you.

354
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,380
Okay, one more time.

355
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,465
These are all
isolinear rods.

356
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:19,301
The ones with the white labels
contain data

357
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,013
relating to the engineering
systems controls

358
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:23,764
the red-labeled ones

359
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:26,184
are for library
and information storage

360
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,562
and the blue ones are...?

361
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,147
I'm never going to get this.

362
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:32,815
Give yourself some time.

363
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,525
I didn't get a handle
on this stuff

364
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,986
until almost a year
after I joined Starfleet.

365
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:38,946
I mean, it's not
like you're going off

366
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,781
to the Academy
tomorrow, is it?

367
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,159
(<i> sighs</i> )

368
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,410
What's wrong?

369
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,661
Nothing.

370
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:48,414
It's just that, why
does everyone assume

371
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,332
that I'm going
to the Academy?

372
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,044
Well, you want to go,
don't you?

373
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,839
Not really.

374
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:00,259
Does your father know?

375
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,762
He wouldn't understand.

376
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,388
I know how you feel.

377
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,767
You know what my father
wanted me to be?

378
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,268
A musician.

379
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,854
It's true.

380
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,899
I was supposed to be
a cello player.

381
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,151
He made me practice
every day.

382
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,403
I got to be pretty good.

383
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,823
When I was 17, he sent
a recorded audition

384
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,451
to the Aldebaran
Music Academy.

385
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,869
What happened?

386
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,204
Oh, I got in.

387
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:30,330
It was the happiest day
of his life.

388
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,250
I didn't know
how to tell him

389
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,667
I didn't want to go.

390
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,212
So, two days before
I was due to leave

391
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:38,923
I went into town
and signed up for Starfleet.

392
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,925
What did your dad do?

393
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,260
Oh, he was furious.

394
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,845
But once he calmed down
a little

395
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,556
he saw how much
I wanted to join.

396
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:50,643
Nowadays when I go home,
he introduces me as...

397
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,229
"My son

398
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:58,400
Senior Chief Specialist
Miles Edward O'Brien."

399
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,735
The point is

400
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:03,530
you've got to live
your own life.

401
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,365
I don't want to
disappoint my dad.

402
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,827
Hey, your dad's
not a bad guy.

403
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,078
He'll come around.

404
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,205
Just give him some time.

405
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,761
(<i> clears throat</i> )

406
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:28,514
So...

407
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,057
What did you think?

408
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,642
Of your speech?

409
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,727
Mm-hmm.

410
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,147
I liked everything about it...

411
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:37,606
except the content.

412
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,357
You disagree
with my interpretation

413
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,693
of the Eighth Prophecy?

414
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,403
"Disagree" is a bit
of an understatement.

415
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,282
"Passionately disagree"
is more like it.

416
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:48,159
The way you have
of taking a prophecy

417
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:50,661
and showing that it can mean
exactly the opposite

418
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,164
of the accepted
interpretation is...

419
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:54,248
Oh, it's brilliant.

420
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,499
Uh... insightful.

421
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,627
Infuriating.

422
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,964
Maybe we should talk
about something else.

423
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,507
Like what?

424
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:06,927
Well, the Ilvian
katterpod crop maybe?

425
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:08,470
Or, uh...

426
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,682
the new nature preserve
in Hedrikspool Province.

427
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,351
Hmm? No?

428
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:16,687
Maybe the standings in
the Springball Championship.

429
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,314
You follow springball?

430
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:21,483
Religiously... if you'll
pardon the expression.

431
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,527
I even used to play
a little.

432
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,196
Me, too.

433
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,781
I had Chief O'Brien design
a springball holosuite program.

434
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,075
Really?

435
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,327
Let's go.

436
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:33,453
You want to play springball?

437
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,997
Why not?

438
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,001
Well, unless you have
a more pressing engagement.

439
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,920
Not that I can think of.

440
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,338
Good.

441
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,590
I could use
the practice.

442
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:58,020
From what I understand

443
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:01,648
you... helped found
this colony.

444
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,109
That's right.

445
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,485
I'm the oldest one left.

446
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,446
This colony must be
very important to you.

447
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,616
You helped found it,
you raised a family here.

448
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:14,412
I'm very proud
of what we've accomplished.

449
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:16,956
Then explain
something to me.

450
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:21,001
This colony is undergoing
a serious crisis.

451
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:24,213
Your daughter is
among the missing.

452
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:26,882
Yet, you hardly
seem concerned.

453
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:30,052
There is nothing I can do
to change things.

454
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:32,263
I wish there were.

455
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:35,557
Now, is there anything else,
or can I go?

456
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,518
Are you sure you're all right?

457
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,478
Why wouldn't I be?

458
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,982
You seem to be
in a great deal of pain.

459
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,691
Why do you say that?

460
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,029
I can see it in your eyes.

461
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:51,991
Perhaps you'd like
to sit here for a moment

462
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,951
and rest.

463
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,578
Well, it wouldn't do much good.

464
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,705
You see, I'm dying.

465
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,334
I'm sorry.

466
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,294
Well, I've had a good life.

467
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:05,254
No regrets.

468
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:08,466
I wish I could see
my daughter once again.

469
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:11,344
Now, if there are
no more questions...

470
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,473
Actually, there
is one thing

471
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:16,974
I've been wondering.

472
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,020
How come...

473
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,856
no one ever leaves
the village?

474
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,649
I haven't met anyone yet

475
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:28,027
who's ever been
outside this valley.

476
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,111
Any idea why?

477
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:30,737
I suppose it's because

478
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,407
people around here
don't like to travel.

479
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,451
After all,
there's no place to go.

480
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:37,411
How can you be so sure?

481
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,621
Have<i> you</i> ever left the valley?

482
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,124
Now that you mention it...

483
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,750
no.

484
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,045
When I asked Colyus

485
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,880
if he searched
outside the valley

486
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,424
for the missing people,
he looked surprised

487
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,592
as if he'd never
thought of it before.

488
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,094
I find that very peculiar.

489
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:55,595
Where I come from

490
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:58,349
we would have searched
the entire countryside.

491
00:25:58,391 --> 00:25:59,892
Yes.

492
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:04,397
I suppose Colyus thought
there was no point to it.

493
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:06,648
But I guarantee you...

494
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,943
there are no missing people
out there.

495
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,196
You're sure of that?

496
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,614
Absolutely.

497
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:26,752
TAYA:
And then the great Minra said
to the evil changeling

498
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:29,380
"Maybe you<i> can</i> turn
into a mountain

499
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:31,924
"or a Ghergher Beast
or a tornado

500
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:35,302
"but those are big things,
and big things are easy.

501
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:38,305
"I bet you can't turn
into something small

502
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,640
like a loaf of grain bread."

503
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,060
And the changeling
said, "Yes, I can"

504
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:44,562
and he did.

505
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,855
Then do you know
what happened?

506
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:49,607
The great Minra
gobbled him up.

507
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,777
How'd you know that?

508
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:54,738
The changeling in your story
wasn't very smart.

509
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,744
Could<i> you</i> turn into a loaf
of grain bread?

510
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:04,290
I suppose I could.

511
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:06,750
Show me.

512
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,212
And let you gobble me up?

513
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:12,798
I don't think so.

514
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,305
See that tree?

515
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,432
Sometimes we go there
to play.

516
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:23,892
That's the furthest
I've ever been

517
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:25,311
from the village.

518
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,686
ODO: Wait here.

519
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,688
TAYA: But I want
to come see, too.

520
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,107
ODO: Please, do as I say.

521
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,485
Lieutenant, would
you come with me?

522
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,326
I'm still not reading

523
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,659
any other life-forms

524
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:44,079
and no indication
of any power source.

525
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,665
Did you see that?

526
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,876
It just vanished!

527
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:53,422
It happened just as
we passed those bushes.

528
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,843
Taya.

529
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,223
Taya, don't come
any closer!

530
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:05,892
But I brought you
some Harrid berries.

531
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,581
Odo says you know
what happened

532
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,124
to the missing
villagers.

533
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,335
I think I do.

534
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,462
It's a little
complicated to explain.

535
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:36,006
It'd probably be easier
if I showed you.

536
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,258
May I have your cloak?

537
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,926
My... my cloak?

538
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,053
Please.

539
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,680
Well...

540
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,766
Thank you.

541
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,273
Now, stand back.

542
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:54,941
(<i> sniffs</i> )

543
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,572
I'm waiting.

544
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,407
This may take a minute.

545
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,825
I don't want to make a mistake.

546
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,585
That was my favorite cloak!

547
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:14,920
Please, stay
where you are.

548
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,811
Are you saying
somebody used our reactor

549
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,980
to transport the victims away?

550
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,190
DAX:
No.

551
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:36,650
It's not a transporter.

552
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,485
It's a holographic
projector.

553
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,820
It creates an omicron
particle field

554
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,781
and then manipulates
the field

555
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,366
to form physical objects
like your cloak.

556
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:48,912
Well, what does this have to do
with the missing people?

557
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:54,126
The people are made up
of omicron particles, too.

558
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:58,255
You mean they're...

559
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,507
holograms?

560
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:02,551
I'm afraid so.

561
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:05,095
You see, the component
that controls

562
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:07,389
the particle field--
it's breaking down

563
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,849
and that's why people
are disappearing.

564
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,477
Well, that's ridiculous!

565
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,562
Some of the victims
were my friends.

566
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:15,355
One of them is my nephew.

567
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:16,898
If I'm right

568
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,319
everyone and everything
in this village

569
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,738
is a holographic projection.

570
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:26,533
And I thought I was desperate
to find an answer.

571
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:27,701
Listen to her, Colyus.

572
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,869
I know this is difficult
to accept.

573
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:35,167
It's going to take a whole lot
more than a vanishing cloak

574
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:38,170
to make me believe
I'm some kind of hologram.

575
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,506
I'd be skeptical,
too, if I were you

576
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,675
but we have
further proof.

577
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:44,301
What kind of proof?

578
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,054
The holographic
field ends

579
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,890
just outside this valley,
and earlier today

580
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,934
Taya tried to reach
past the edge

581
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,187
and her arm disappeared.

582
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,855
Is she all right?

583
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,148
She's fine.

584
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,525
Her arm re-materialized

585
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,485
as soon as she pulled it
back inside.

586
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,905
Where exactly did this happen?

587
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,033
We could show you
if you'd like.

588
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,951
I think you'd better.

589
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,084
I'm sorry.

590
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,127
Don't apologize.

591
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:21,338
I should have
seen it coming.

592
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,633
Where did you learn
to play like that?

593
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:28,721
My brothers and I used to play
at the Singha refugee camp.

594
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:31,264
There wasn't much else to do.

595
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,933
Yeah, I was at Relliketh.

596
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,730
And, uh, now...

597
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,939
uh, here we are.

598
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,278
Well, uh, uh, that, uh...

599
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,946
that was delicious.

600
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:49,825
Well...

601
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:52,327
thank the replicator.

602
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:54,872
Here, let me help.

603
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,415
That's not necessary.

604
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,457
Your shoulder...

605
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,000
Never felt better.

606
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:05,048
Maybe I do need
some help after all.

607
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:18,562
I'll have to remember
to thank Prylar Rhit

608
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:20,063
for inviting you here.

609
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,611
You'd better
tell him soon.

610
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,571
Prylar Rhit...

611
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:31,199
is going to be
returning to Bajor.

612
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:34,536
It appears he fancies
himself something...

613
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,329
of a dabo player.

614
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,664
Oh... really?

615
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,082
Mm-hmm.

616
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,543
He's run up a...

617
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,837
sizable gambling debt.

618
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,299
It's caused...

619
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,009
quite a scandal in
the Vedek assembly.

620
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:56,809
Let me get
this straight--

621
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:00,854
the man who invited you
here to the station...

622
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:03,565
owes money... to Quark?

623
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:04,983
Who?

624
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,778
The little troll
who runs the dabo tables?

625
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,738
I got to go.

626
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,739
But why?

627
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:12,574
I need to talk
to Prylar Rhit.

628
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,534
I think I know
the real reason

629
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:15,786
he invited you here.

630
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,207
(<i> crowd clamoring</i> )

631
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,418
COLYUS:
People, please!

632
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,419
Please!

633
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:25,420
Quiet!

634
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:28,590
(<i> shouting continues</i> )

635
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:29,925
Quiet!

636
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:31,426
Calm down!

637
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:32,928
Quiet!

638
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,848
Calm down, everybody.
We have to make a decision here.

639
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:37,975
Colyus, you should be out
looking for my wife

640
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,810
and all the others
who are missing!

641
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:42,562
Not wasting time listening
to these strangers
and their lies.

642
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,314
You all witnessed what happened

643
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:47,275
when they brought us
to the edge of the field.

644
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:49,653
Merruk, we both saw
your hand disappear.

645
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,196
It could have
been a trick.

646
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,198
It wasn't a trick.

647
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,367
Then how come we've never
learned of this before?

648
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,160
Because none of
you ever tried

649
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,620
to leave the valley.

650
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:01,999
It's possible
we were programmed not to leave

651
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,543
so that we<i> wouldn't</i>
learn the truth.

652
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,337
Now, we have
to shut down the system.

653
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:10,590
If we don't fix it soon,
the whole village

654
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,467
will disappear.

655
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:14,177
Dax...

656
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:17,263
you said if you can
fix the machine

657
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:21,518
you might be able to bring back
the missing people.

658
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,478
We hope so.

659
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,271
What if you turn off
the projector

660
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,148
and you can't get it back on?

661
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,527
Then this village
will cease to exist.

662
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,991
The system's only
a few months away

663
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:37,325
from complete
failure anyway.

664
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:38,493
At least this way

665
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:40,704
we have a chance
to save you.

666
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:43,206
Grandfather, please.

667
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:47,126
Let her try.

668
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,046
What do you think?

669
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:53,174
Well, we can't
go on like this.

670
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:56,553
I guess we should
let her shut it down.

671
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,346
Are there any objections?

672
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,351
Then it's settled.

673
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:06,104
I can't wait
to see my mother.

674
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:14,195
Your face isn't
so scary...

675
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,781
once you get used to it.

676
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,285
Thank you, Taya.

677
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,253
All right, here we go.

678
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,146
Odo...

679
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,565
RURIGAN: Don't look
so surprised.

680
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,442
I'm as real as you are.

681
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:03,453
RURIGAN:
I was happy living
on Yadera Prime.

682
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:06,581
That is, until the
Dominion took over

683
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:10,168
and changed our
whole way of life.

684
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,920
And I realized one morning

685
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:15,757
that I didn't really
belong there anymore.

686
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:17,884
So I came here.

687
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,680
And I used a hologenerator

688
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:26,351
to recreate all the things
that I'd lost.

689
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,936
I've lived here
in my village

690
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:30,313
for nearly 30 years.

691
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:34,985
And I've watched
the people marry...

692
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:36,069
have children...

693
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,781
grow old...

694
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:41,116
and sometimes
I even forgot

695
00:36:41,158 --> 00:36:44,161
that they were
holograms.

696
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:48,165
But it's over.

697
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,876
It's over.

698
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:53,045
And I would appreciate it

699
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:56,214
if you'd take me back
to Yadera Prime.

700
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:59,258
But what about the villagers?

701
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,677
What about your granddaughter?

702
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,721
She's not real.

703
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,015
Technically,
I suppose you're right.

704
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:08,643
Maybe, by our definition,
Taya's not real.

705
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:11,646
Her memories are stored
in a computer.

706
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:14,482
Her body is made up
of omicron particles.

707
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:17,027
But who's to say
that our definition of life

708
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,611
is the only valid one?

709
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,531
I'm sure if you asked her,
she'd say she was real.

710
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,992
She thinks,
she feels.

711
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:27,037
She only seems to.

712
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:29,915
It's all an illusion.

713
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,333
An illusion I created.

714
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,794
Well, you said you created
the village 30 years ago.

715
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,129
Taya's only ten.

716
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,464
I designed the program

717
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,009
so the villagers could have
children if they wanted to.

718
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:43,386
Then Taya's personality
is a combination

719
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,805
of her parents'
personalities.

720
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,265
Just like a real child.

721
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:48,975
You had nothing to do with it.

722
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:51,310
But she's still a hologram.

723
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,437
Maybe...

724
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,189
but I saw the way

725
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:56,233
you held her hand
when she was sad.

726
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,443
I saw the way
you tried to comfort her

727
00:37:58,484 --> 00:37:59,652
when she was frightened.

728
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:05,158
I... I didn't want her
to get hurt.

729
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,327
If she's not real,
what does it matter?

730
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,328
It matters.

731
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,873
It matters to me.

732
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:14,918
Why should it matter to you
if a hologram cries?

733
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,298
Because I love her.

734
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:25,762
And she loves you.

735
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,723
Don't you see?

736
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:30,183
She's real to you.

737
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:32,102
And she's real to me, too.

738
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:33,728
They're all real.

739
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:36,689
And you can't
turn your back on them now.

740
00:38:52,122 --> 00:38:53,539
Jake, how was work?

741
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,958
Okay.

742
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,836
It's kind of fun
working with Chief O'Brien.

743
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:01,422
But it would be better
if I knew what I was doing.

744
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,424
You'll get there.

745
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,177
I guess so.

746
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:08,346
I'm glad you decided
to stick with it.

747
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,016
Yeah.

748
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,143
Dad...

749
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:19,274
I don't want to join Starfleet.

750
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,118
Since when?

751
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,786
S-since forever.

752
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:35,581
Starfleet is too much
like you.

753
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,252
I need to find what's me.

754
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:42,130
Does that make any sense?

755
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:44,883
Perfect sense.

756
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,009
It does?

757
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,763
It's your life, Jake.

758
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,183
You have to choose
your own way.

759
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:55,352
There is only one thing

760
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,312
I want from you.

761
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:59,231
Find something you love

762
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:02,901
then do it
the best you can.

763
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,944
I'll try.

764
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:06,196
Good.

765
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:09,448
Then you'll make
the old man proud.

766
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,617
(<i> clears throat</i> )
I'd better go study.

767
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,870
I'm still trying
to figure out

768
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,372
those isolinear rods.

769
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,835
(<i> buzz of conversation</i> )

770
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,512
KIRA:
Hello, Quark.

771
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:34,599
Major.

772
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,559
To what do I owe this
unexpected pleasure?

773
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,770
I just thought
I'd let you know--

774
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:39,938
we caught your cousin

775
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,981
trying to slip back
onto this station

776
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:45,151
and guess what we
confiscated from him?

777
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,612
Bone carvings.

778
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:50,656
Stolen from a museum
on Cardassia V.

779
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,784
I always knew
Kono was no good.

780
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,786
I only wish
we could have caught

781
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,163
the two of you together.

782
00:40:57,205 --> 00:41:00,083
Life is full of
disappointments.

783
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,877
By the way,
Prylar Rhit tells me

784
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:03,962
that you encouraged him

785
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,047
to invite Bareil
onto this station.

786
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,258
That a crime?

787
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,176
Not at all.

788
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:12,595
I just wanted to thank you.

789
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,472
I found him very...

790
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,683
diverting.

791
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:33,950
Not diverting enough.

792
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:38,997
All right,
nothing to do now

793
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,374
but reactivate the system
and see what happens.

794
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,541
Wait.

795
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,253
Lieutenant, I'd like
to ask a favor.

796
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:48,089
If this works,
please don't tell the others

797
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:49,632
that I'm...
not like them.

798
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,259
I don't want
to be treated

799
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:53,428
any differently
than before.

800
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,932
Of course.

801
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,868
(<i> crowd murmuring</i> )

802
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:22,207
TAYA: Mother?

803
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,876
TAYA: Mother?

804
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,752
TAYA: Mother!

805
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,429
Well, you did it.

806
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:38,014
We upgraded the
system's memory core

807
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:39,557
and realigned the
field generators.

808
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:41,184
I don't think

809
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,353
you'll have to worry
about anyone disappearing now.

810
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:45,480
We just have to get used
to the fact

811
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:46,898
that we're holograms.

812
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,816
We're alive and we have
our families back.

813
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:50,568
That's the only
thing that counts.

814
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,695
I wonder who
created all this?

815
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,364
ODO:
Whoever it was

816
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:56,615
did a fine job.

817
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,243
COLYUS:
They did, didn't they?

818
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:02,163
Well, it was good
working with you, Odo.

819
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:04,332
Next time you're
on this side of the galaxy

820
00:43:04,374 --> 00:43:06,251
I hope you come by
and see us.

821
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,044
I would like that.

822
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:10,380
We don't get
that many visitors.

823
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:13,841
Odo.

824
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,011
My mother's back.

825
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:18,179
I'm glad.

826
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:22,100
You're leaving.

827
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,684
I'm afraid so.

828
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:26,812
I'll miss you.

829
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,238
I'll miss you, too.

830
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,867
Thank you for bringing
my mother back.

831
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:43,455
I hope you find
your parents, too.

832
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:48,000
Thank you, Taya.

833
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,544
So do I.

834
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:08,729
Taya...

835
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:21,033
(<i> giggling softly</i> )

836
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:26,247
Computer,
two to beam up.
