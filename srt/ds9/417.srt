1
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,339
I thought you said you'd started
straightening this place up.

2
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:08,091
You should have seen it before.

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,926
Look, Keiko's shuttle will be here
before we know it.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,886
We should have left
the holosuite hours ago.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,514
What, and let the Jerries
cross the Channel? Never.

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,766
It is sort of a shame
to pack this stuff away.

7
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:20,061
Wish we didn't have to.
It's like a sculpture

8
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,188
a monument to your year as a bachelor.

9
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,606
Ah, I suppose it is.

10
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,817
Who are we to dismantle this piece of art?

11
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,110
I don't know.

12
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:29,779
But if we don't, Keiko'll dismantle me.

13
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,508
Daddy.

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,135
Hi, sweetie.

15
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,219
Oh!

16
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,308
Hi.

17
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,735
The one good thing about going away
is coming home.

18
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,154
I never want to be apart like that again.

19
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:15,325
Daddy, Daddy! I have a little brother

20
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,536
Really? Is that him?

21
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:20,997
No. He's in there.

22
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,000
Surprise.

23
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:27,837
A baby?

24
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:33,593
Yeah. I--I thought you'd be happy.
I mean, we talked about it

25
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,762
and decided we'd start trying.

26
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:39,849
Oh, I know.
We--We--Well, but your last visit,

27
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,893
you were only here the one night, and...

28
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,604
I thought it'd take a couple of nights.

29
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:48,900
To be honest... a lot more nights.

30
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,611
I guess we just got lucky this time.

31
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,240
I guess so.

32
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,333
-Vedek Porta.
-Nerys.

33
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:11,798
So, this is where you are
when you're not at the Temple.

34
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,093
Very impressive.

35
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,011
Haven't you ever been to Ops?

36
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:22,016
What business would an old monk have here,
except maybe helping a young couple

37
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,685
to meet the Emissary?

38
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,479
Are you sure this is a good time?

39
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,898
I think he'll be able to fit you in.

40
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,942
Thank you so much for doing this, Major.

41
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,443
Oh, I'm glad to.

42
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,739
They can take the <i>Rubicon.</i>

43
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:37,907
( door chimes )

44
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,784
Come in.

45
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:41,828
Vedek Porta's here

46
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,496
with the young couple
that just got married.

47
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,832
They're hoping
to get the Emissary's blessing.

48
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:47,917
Bring them in.

49
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,214
You remember the words?
The marriage blessing?

50
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,507
-Mm-hmm.
-I think so.

51
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,889
Emissary, we're very grateful to you
for seeing us.

52
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,181
Not at all.

53
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,350
Now, if you'll just join hands...

54
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:11,482
<i>Zhia'kala, tar'eh anu suur...</i>

55
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,903
<i>te'von, aka'lu rez... ka'vor</i>

56
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,195
<i>mat'ana kel.</i>

57
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,239
Thank you.

58
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,449
Thank you very much.

59
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,582
Your accent is getting
much better, Emissary.

60
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,292
I'm glad to hear it.

61
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,255
( sighing )

62
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,300
It isn't that bad, is it,
being the Emissary?

63
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,638
A few ceremonies, an occasional blessing.

64
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,848
I didn't say it was that bad.

65
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,310
It's just hard getting used
to being a religious icon.

66
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:50,188
-DAX: Really?
-I think I'd like it.

67
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,773
<i>Kira to Sisko.</i>

68
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,400
-Go ahead.
<i>-You'd better get out here.</i>

69
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,027
<i>There's something</i>
<i>coming through the wormhole.</i>

70
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,042
A lightship.

71
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,210
KIRA: I don't know where it came from.

72
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,754
According to remote sensors,
it never entered the wormhole.

73
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,340
From these readings, I'd say that ship's
about 300 years old.

74
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,591
SISKO: Life signs?

75
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,301
There's someone on board,

76
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,011
-a Bajoran.
-Try hailing them.

77
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,305
KIRA: No response.

78
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,141
DAX: Whoever's in there could be injured.

79
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,144
Tractor the ship into transporter range

80
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,563
and beam the passenger
directly into the Infirmary.

81
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,445
( moaning )

82
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,158
He's a little disoriented.

83
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,205
I'm Captain Benjamin Sisko.

84
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,417
You're aboard a Federation
space station near Bajor.

85
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,836
This is Kira Nerys, my First Officer.

86
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,090
Who are you?

87
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,343
I am the Emissary.

88
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,513
I was headed back to Bajor.
My lightship was caught in an ion storm.

89
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,141
{\an8}It nearly tore it apart.

90
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:18,563
{\an8}A girder came loose from the bulkhead
and impaled me through the shoulder, here.

91
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:22,608
{\an8}I remember thinking I was going to die
alone in space

92
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,487
{\an8}when a strange opening
appeared in the sky.

93
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:32,493
{\an8}AKOREM: I was terrified at first,
and then, I realized what was happening.

94
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:38,499
{\an8}The Prophets were opening the gates
of the Celestial Temple

95
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,043
{\an8}and drawing me to them.

96
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,588
{\an8}What happened then?

97
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,381
{\an8}AKOREM: It's difficult to describe.

98
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:51,679
{\an8}They took the form of people that I know,
my grandfather, my brother,

99
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,098
{\an8}AKOREM: so they could communicate with me.

100
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,768
{\an8}-You spoke to them?
-I didn't have to.

101
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,980
{\an8}I could sense
their understanding, their grace.

102
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:06,861
{\an8}I've never felt such bliss.
And then they healed me.

103
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:11,491
{\an8}A light washed over me,
and then my wound was gone.

104
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,829
{\an8}They gave me back my life. I felt reborn.

105
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,915
{\an8}When exactly did you leave Bajor?

106
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,127
{\an8}Oh, it couldn't have
been more than a few days ago.

107
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:24,754
{\an8}What was the year?

108
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,839
{\an8}9174.

109
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,678
{\an8}That was over 200 years ago.

110
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:35,765
{\an8}200 years?

111
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:41,562
{\an8}My wife...

112
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,650
{\an8}My parents... they're gone.

113
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,153
BASHIR: If you give us your name,

114
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,697
maybe we can contact your descendants.

115
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,408
Let them know you're... alive.

116
00:08:55,535 --> 00:09:00,081
Akorem. Akorem Laan.
But I have no descendants.

117
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:04,252
My brother died last winter,
and my wife and I never had children.

118
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,213
Akorem Laan, the poet?

119
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,423
I'm a poet, yes.

120
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,636
You wrote <i>Kitara's Song</i>
and <i>The Call of the Prophets?</i>

121
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,472
You know my work?

122
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,685
You're considered one of the greatest
poets of Bajor.

123
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:25,147
Every schoolchild can recite
<i>Gaudaal's Lament </i>from memory.

124
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,276
People still read my work,
after all this time?

125
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,447
Perhaps, that's part
of the Prophets' plan for me.

126
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,366
Their plan?

127
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,619
It's not clear to me yet
why they made me their Emissary,

128
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,289
but I know they gave me back
my life for a reason.

129
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:45,876
Akorem, a great deal has happened
since you've been gone.

130
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:50,131
Maybe Major Kira can spend
some time filling you in.

131
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,051
"Major Kira"?

132
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,386
That's right.

133
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,639
But your family would be part
of the artist<i> D'jarra.</i>

134
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,266
<i>D'jarra?</i>

135
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,687
Bajor used to have a strict caste system.

136
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,815
A person's work was dictated
by what family they were born into.

137
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,278
You no longer follow your <i>D'jarras?</i>

138
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,488
When the Cardassians occupied Bajor,

139
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,617
we gave up the <i>D'jarras,</i>
so that we could fight them.

140
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,952
We all became soldiers.

141
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,955
The Cardassians occupied Bajor?

142
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:24,749
For over 50 years.

143
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,338
It seems you're right, Captain.

144
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,174
A great deal has happened
since I've been gone.

145
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,934
If you look at the prophecies
about the Emissary,

146
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:47,396
a lot of them make much more sense
with Akorem in the picture.

147
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,481
Really?

148
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:51,734
Every text I've read says
that the Prophets

149
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,236
will name their Emissary
by calling him to them,

150
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,572
that he would find the Celestial Temple

151
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,116
that there, the Prophets would give
him back his life.

152
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:00,910
Go on.

153
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,329
They didn't give me back my life.

154
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,708
Not literally, but they did help you
get your life back together.

155
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,794
True enough, but I wasn't the first one

156
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:13,422
to find the wormhole,
or to meet the Prophets.

157
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:14,548
Akorem was.

158
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,053
Benjamin, I thought you didn't believe
in the prophecies.

159
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,262
I don't.

160
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,350
Then why are you using them
to justify giving up your position?

161
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,894
I guess I was looking for something
to convince me

162
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,854
that I was making the right decision.

163
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,440
So your mind's made up?
You're going to step aside?

164
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,777
Akorem will make a far better Emissary
than I ever was.

165
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,070
He's Bajoran.

166
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:41,784
He's a revered poet, and he wants the job.
Besides, Starfleet will be thrilled.

167
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:45,913
They never liked the idea that
the Bajorans saw me as a religious figure.

168
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,250
How do you know the Bajorans will accept
Akorem as their new Emissary?

169
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,335
I talked to Vedek Porta.

170
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,546
He seems to think that as long
as I make it clear

171
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,715
that I'm stepping aside
voluntarily, they will.

172
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,260
So you're off the hook.

173
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,053
How does it feel?

174
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,223
It feels, uh... good.

175
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,851
No more ceremonies to attend.

176
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,519
No more blessings to give.

177
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:14,024
No more prophecies to fulfill.
I'm just a Starfleet officer again.

178
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,944
All I have to worry
about are the Klingons,

179
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,863
the Dominion and the Maquis.

180
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,658
I feel like I'm on vacation.

181
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:31,667
Chief!

182
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,420
Congratulations, Dad.

183
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,505
-You heard?
-Great news, my friend.

184
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,550
-Come have a drink. Celebrate.
-I really should be getting home.

185
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,926
Oh, just one.

186
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,261
All right.

187
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,514
Quark, did you hear?

188
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,017
Chief O'Brien is having a baby.

189
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,686
I thought your females carried your young.

190
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:54,732
My wife. My wife is having the baby.

191
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,692
Congratulations.

192
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,279
I remember when my nephew Nog was a baby.

193
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,032
Cutest thing you ever saw.

194
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,159
You know babies.

195
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,953
Every little thing they pick up
goes straight into their ears.

196
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,998
Oh, I used to love reading to him.

197
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:16,837
You know, "See Brak acquire.
Acquire, Brak, acquire."

198
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:22,009
Just think. Soon there'll be two
little O'Briens

199
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,594
scampering about underfoot.

200
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,846
Hard to believe, isn't it?

201
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,973
Mind you, they do say the second
one is easier,

202
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,184
since you've already been
through all the diapers

203
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:33,103
and the endless crying
and the sleepless nights.

204
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,481
-Yeah.
-Cheers.

205
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,691
Oh... cheers.

206
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,069
Is something wrong, Chief?

207
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,781
No. Nothing at all. I couldn't be happier.

208
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,075
QUARK: Did you hear?
Keiko's going to have another baby.

209
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,451
Now?

210
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,786
No.

211
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,454
Seven months.

212
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,081
I see.

213
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,876
-Worf delivered Molly, you know.
-Really?

214
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,711
The <i>Enterprise</i> was damaged.

215
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,339
Keiko and he were trapped
together when her time came.

216
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,842
Oh, well, I'll, uh, be sure and call you

217
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,678
when she's ready to deliver.
You can lend a hand.

218
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,179
Seven months?

219
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,976
Unfortunately, I will be away
from the station at that time.

220
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,310
( chuckles )

221
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:14,979
Far away.

222
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,066
Visiting my parents... On Earth.

223
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,653
Excuse me.

224
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,990
( both laughing )

225
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,827
I don't know who's more anxious
about this baby, you or Worf.

226
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,999
The thing is, Julian,
now that Molly's a little older,

227
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:38,210
I was hoping to be able to spend
some time with Keiko again.

228
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:44,174
I thought we could... I don't know...
go out at night. Don't get me wrong.

229
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,260
I know once I hold my little baby
in my arms,

230
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,888
I'll be the happiest man
in the world, but...

231
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,390
I wasn't expecting it to happen so soon.

232
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,605
-How about a game of darts?
-Don't you have to go home?

233
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,899
Yeah.

234
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,500
Major, come to see Akorem speak?

235
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,295
The Emissary's first public appearance?
I wouldn't miss it.

236
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,380
I'm surprised to hear you call him that.

237
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:24,632
Why?

238
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:28,594
Akorem Laan was... is a great man.

239
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,304
He's been with the Prophets
for over 200 years,

240
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,972
and now they sent him back to us.

241
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,809
Yes, but two days ago, you believed
Captain Sisko was the Emissary.

242
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,604
Well, he made it clear,
he wants to step aside.

243
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:42,900
Does that mean he never really
was the Emissary?

244
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,777
No.

245
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:48,072
But they can't both be.

246
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,450
I don't know.
What do you want from me, Odo?

247
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,745
Forgive me, Major.
I don't mean to be difficult,

248
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,622
but your faith seems to have led you

249
00:15:56,705 --> 00:16:01,418
-to something of a contradiction.
-I don't see it as a contradiction.

250
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,004
I don't understand.

251
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,174
That's the thing about faith,

252
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,260
if you don't have it,
you can't understand it,

253
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:14,139
and if you do,
no explanation is necessary.

254
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,185
( applause )

255
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:32,825
Ever since the Prophets
returned me to my people,

256
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:36,161
I've asked myself the same questions
over and over again.

257
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,915
Why did they keep me
with them for so long?

258
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,544
Why did they return me to my people now?

259
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,796
<i>I now know the answers.</i>

260
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,967
<i>Bajor suffered a great wound</i>
<i>while I was with the Prophets,</i>

261
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,177
<i>the Cardassian Occupation.</i>

262
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,514
<i>The Bajor that I've returned </i>
<i>to has lost its way.</i>

263
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:59,476
<i>People no longer follow the path</i>
<i>the Prophets have laid out for them.</i>

264
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,022
<i>They no longer follow their </i>D'jarras.

265
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,818
<i>Artists have become soldiers.</i>
<i>Priests have become merchants.</i>

266
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:13,866
Farmers have become politicians.
We must heal the wounds of the occupation.

267
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,536
We must return to our <i>D'jarras.</i>

268
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,373
We must reclaim what we were
and follow the path

269
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,417
the Prophets have laid out for us.

270
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,504
It is their will that farmers
return to their land,

271
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:31,091
painters to their canvasses,
priests to their temples.

272
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,637
If we do this, if we follow our <i>D'jarras,</i>

273
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,182
then Bajor will flourish again

274
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,560
and become the green and peaceful
land I remember.

275
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:45,189
It will be as if the occupation
never happened.

276
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:51,528
By returning to our <i>D'jarras, </i>
we will have erased it forever.

277
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,905
( applause )

278
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,425
I wanted to talk to you before
you left for Bajor.

279
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:14,676
Of course.

280
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,638
I was surprised by your speech.

281
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,099
I had no idea you
were going to advocate change

282
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,184
on such a massive scale.

283
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,479
It's what the Prophets want for Bajor.

284
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,189
It's why they sent me.

285
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,440
Are you sure of that?

286
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,025
Absolutely.

287
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,486
The Emissary knows that what
he's proposing

288
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,738
will be difficult for some people
to accept.

289
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,157
He doesn't expect things
to change overnight.

290
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:41,036
So you're not going
to ask First Minister Shakaar

291
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,038
to step down and go back to farming?

292
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,790
No, of course not.

293
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,667
But frankly, by the next election,

294
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,086
I doubt very many people
will be left on Bajor

295
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,505
who would elect a farmer
to political office.

296
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:54,716
We hope that, eventually,
the people will support

297
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,678
enforcement of the <i>D'jarras</i>
by legal sanction.

298
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,389
So, if someone defies their caste?

299
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:05,602
Society will have appropriate remedies
at its disposal, such as deportation.

300
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,233
You realize that caste-based
discrimination

301
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:17,030
goes against the Federation Charter.
If Bajor returns to the <i>D'jarra </i>system,

302
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:21,660
I have no doubt that its petition
to join the Federation will be rejected.

303
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,163
Kai Winn and I have already discussed it.

304
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,373
We're willing to make that sacrifice

305
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,292
in order to follow the will
of the Prophets.

306
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,921
I had a feeling Winn
would see it that way.

307
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,134
Well, the Emissary's transport
leaves shortly.

308
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:47,102
As a Starfleet officer, I am bound by oath
not to interfere with Bajoran affairs,

309
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:52,024
but... as a friend to Bajor,

310
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,068
I have to say
giving up Federation membership

311
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,737
would be a mistake.

312
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,494
Oh.

313
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,497
Your <i>pagh</i> is strong.

314
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,793
I see now why Kai Opaka
believed you were the Emissary...

315
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,880
and why Winn fears you.

316
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,927
Good-bye, Captain.

317
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,013
Good-bye, Emissary.

318
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:49,957
Morning.

319
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,751
Guess I'll have
to take my <i>raktajino </i>with me.

320
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,753
Please, sit here.

321
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:55,963
You're not finished.

322
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,924
I'll find someplace else to sit.

323
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,134
You don't have to get up for me.

324
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,178
You're <i>Ih'valla.</i>

325
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:04,930
I'm <i>te'nari.</i>

326
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,604
It's been going on all morning...
whenever someone

327
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,940
with a higher-ranking<i> D'jarra </i>comes in.

328
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,737
I guess I'll have to get used
to being treated like that.

329
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,659
I remember when
I got promoted to Lieutenant,

330
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,412
it took me a while to get used
to being called "sir"

331
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,872
by my friends who were still Ensigns.

332
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,251
But that's different.

333
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,837
You'd earned the right
to be treated with respect.

334
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,463
I haven't done anything.

335
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:42,592
Sounds like you have some reservations
about bringing back the <i>D'jarras.</i>

336
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,470
I have some questions, sure.

337
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:51,018
The Emissary is asking something
very difficult of us,

338
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,605
but we have to have faith
that he's guiding us towards something.

339
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,941
Even if what he's guiding you towards

340
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,651
doesn't include the Federation?

341
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,822
It's not our place to question
the Emissary.

342
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,657
No matter what?

343
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,703
Maybe you never realized this, Captain,

344
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,999
but we would have tried to do whatever
you asked of us

345
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,167
when you were Emissary,

346
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,211
no matter how difficult it seemed.

347
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,887
I'd better get to Ops.

348
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,625
( gasping )

349
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,305
( rustling )

350
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,322
( rustling )

351
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,329
Who are you?

352
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,164
Kai Opaka.

353
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,208
Who are you?

354
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,502
What are you doing here?

355
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,003
How did you?

356
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,756
Who are you?

357
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,635
Don't you know me?

358
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,553
OPAKA: Know you?

359
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:53,390
How can I know someone
who doesn't know himself?

360
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:08,446
I think you had what the Bajorans
call an "Orb shadow."

361
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,158
Sometimes, people who have been exposed

362
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,368
to the Orbs of the Prophets
experience hallucinations

363
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,412
weeks, even months later.

364
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,039
-What triggers them?
-An excess of neuropeptides.

365
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,750
I can give you an inhibitor
to make sure it never happens again.

366
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:27,674
Of course, if I do,
you risk never finding out.

367
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,509
Finding out what?

368
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,429
The Bajorans believe
you only have a shadow experience

369
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,514
when you ignore what the Prophets
have been trying to tell you

370
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,849
during an Orb encounter.

371
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,851
Interesting.

372
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:42,689
So... any idea what they might
have been trying to tell you?

373
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,566
Sure.

374
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,905
That I have too many neuropeptides
rolling around in my head.

375
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,288
( sighs )

376
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,594
( sighs )

377
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,705
A bird is a difficult thing to sculpt.

378
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,833
Maybe you should have started
with something simpler.

379
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:48,421
Come in! Come in!
Services are about to begin.

380
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,675
But I can tell I have no aptitude for it.

381
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:54,761
That's because you didn't give yourself
over to what you were doing.

382
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:57,013
How can you say that?
I was up half the night.

383
00:25:57,097 --> 00:26:00,141
I have a, a flock of flightless birds
in my quarters.

384
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,644
But you're still wearing that uniform.

385
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,814
You're still clinging to a false life.

386
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,775
You must do what the Emissary has asked

387
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,736
and follow your <i>D'jarra</i>
with all your heart,

388
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,990
because if you give yourself
over to the Prophets,

389
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,910
they will guide you along the path
they've chosen for you...

390
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:25,041
and you'll know more joy
than you ever thought possible.

391
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,092
O'BRIEN: That a girl. Good shot, Molly!

392
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,386
-Did I win?
-We're just practicing.

393
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,263
-We'll play a game later.
-Try another one.

394
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:40,890
KEIKO: Miles?

395
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,644
Oh, uh...

396
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:49,065
That's mine. Don't worry...
I only wear it in the holosuites.

397
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,651
I suppose Julian has one, too.

398
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:55,697
You two certainly spent
a lot of time in the holosuites.

399
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:58,533
Well, you should be glad.
It kept me out of trouble.

400
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,201
( chuckles )

401
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,746
Remind me to thank Julian
next time I see him.

402
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:03,663
Mmm...

403
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,128
Want to try for twins?

404
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:14,799
I don't think it works that way.
You'd better brush up on your biology.

405
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,092
Teach me.

406
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,513
Look, I drew a pony.

407
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:23,933
Oh.

408
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,435
Let's see.

409
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,982
-Does your pony have a name?
-I don't know.

410
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:36,029
Miles, I still have a lot of specimens
I've got to catalog for the survey.

411
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:38,656
Go ahead. I'll play with Molly.

412
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,242
Oh, Miles, it's good to be home.

413
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,413
Come on, Molly, let's play darts.

414
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,166
Now, remember what I said
about the right way to stand?

415
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,250
O'BRIEN: Let's try again.

416
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,586
I don't want to.

417
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,216
Can Daddy color, too?

418
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,884
I'm coloring.

419
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:27,622
The four-shift rotation
also seems to be improving performance.

420
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:29,374
Less mistakes due to fatigue.

421
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:33,002
Fine. Let's make the change permanent.
Anything else?

422
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,508
I was wondering if, in the next few days

423
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:41,302
you would have the time
to meet with Major Jatarn.

424
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,054
Sure.

425
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:46,641
Is something wrong, sir?

426
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,644
I'm sorry.

427
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:53,565
I just received a communiqué
from Starfleet Command

428
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,984
responding to my report
on the Bajoran situation.

429
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:57,610
That bad?

430
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:58,737
Not yet,

431
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,281
but I can read between the lines.

432
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:08,163
I was sent here
to help bring Bajor into the Federation.

433
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:11,249
That doesn't look like much
of a possibility anymore.

434
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,293
As far as Starfleet is concerned,

435
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,836
I have failed my mission.

436
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,590
That's not fair. It's not your fault.

437
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,301
It is from where they're sitting.

438
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:26,139
The irony is, Starfleet was always trying

439
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:29,017
to get me to distance myself
from this Emissary business.

440
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,393
And now that I have...

441
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,567
Maybe I could talk
to First Minister Shakaar

442
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,778
about sending Starfleet
a communiqué explai--

443
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:42,197
-Thanks.
-It--it'll blow over.

444
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,657
It's not that.

445
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,077
I guess I'm just feeling...

446
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:50,830
I did fail.

447
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:53,416
Sir...

448
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:58,296
Anyway, why did you
want me to meet Jatarn?

449
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,381
( sighs )

450
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,676
We can talk about that another time.

451
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:04,928
What is it, Major?

452
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,349
I think he'd make an excellent
First Officer.

453
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,436
As soon as you can find someone
to take my post,

454
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,271
I'm going to resign my commission.

455
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,273
( sighs )

456
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,859
To follow your...<i> D'jarra.</i>

457
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,738
I'm planning to move back
to the Dahkur Province.

458
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,907
There are a lot of artists
who live in the capital,

459
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,952
and I have a friend there who's willing
to apprentice me.

460
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,580
I'm sorry.

461
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:37,502
The last thing I want to do is to add
to your problems.

462
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,423
This is something I have to do.

463
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,304
( sniffles )

464
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,641
If, um...

465
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,103
If you don't hit it off
with Major Jatarn, um,

466
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,063
I can think of a few other people.

467
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,232
It shouldn't be that hard to find someone
to replace me.

468
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:04,612
I don't doubt that I can find
someone to fill your post...

469
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:09,075
But to replace you?

470
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,127
( door opens, closes )

471
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,552
Computer, time.

472
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:30,054
<i>1921 hours.</i>

473
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,556
Where's Dr. Bashir?

474
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,892
<i>Dr. Bashir is in Quark's bar.</i>

475
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:43,067
Well, I'm chasing a triple 17
and a bull, Morn.

476
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,569
Got some catching up to do.

477
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:45,612
Chief!

478
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,407
Excuse me.

479
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,330
Julian.

480
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,789
How have you been?

481
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,249
Not bad. You?

482
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,001
Oh, you know, all right.

483
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,379
I was heading home.
Thought I'd stop in for a quick pint.

484
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,468
( sighs )

485
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:09,886
It's been a while, eh?

486
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,180
Ha. Seems like weeks.

487
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,724
I see you found someone
to play darts with.

488
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:15,642
Oh, uh...

489
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,811
I've set a board up in our quarters
so Molly and I can play.

490
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,105
Well, Morn's, um... he's pretty good.

491
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,231
So's Molly.

492
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,151
-It's not the same.
-It's not the same.

493
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:34,035
I mean, Molly's just a kid.
You know, we've been playing with magnets.

494
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:37,288
Morn couldn't hit a Yridian yak
at five paces.

495
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,667
We were evenly matched.

496
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,960
We had a good rivalry going on.

497
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,294
Yeah, kept us sharp.

498
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,379
Exactly.

499
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:46,547
You're late.

500
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,509
What do you mean?

501
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,137
It's Thursday, and I've got your usual
holosuite reserved.

502
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,597
Didn't you cancel?

503
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,975
Actually, I was, um, hoping maybe...

504
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,269
No, no, I--I--I got to get home.

505
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,898
What about you, Doctor?
The Battle of Britain awaits.

506
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,110
And you know my policy on cancellations,

507
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,237
no refunds.

508
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,321
Go ahead.

509
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:14,325
Maybe Morn's better in the cockpit
of a spitfire than he is at darts.

510
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:16,160
Ah, it wouldn't be the same.

511
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:19,288
Um... You're right.

512
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:23,167
Morn probably doesn't even know
where England is.

513
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,044
( laughs )

514
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,256
I'll see you.

515
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,309
<i>Odo to Sisko.</i>

516
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:41,769
Go ahead.

517
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,689
<i>You'd better come down to the Promenade.</i>
<i>Someone's been killed.</i>

518
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,445
-What happened?
-We don't know yet.

519
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,531
He fell from the second level.
His neck was broken on impact.

520
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:56,701
-Did anyone see it happen?
-I did.

521
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,328
Was it an accident?

522
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,330
I pushed him.

523
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:07,211
His family name is Imutta.
Their <i>D'jarra </i>is unclean.

524
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,131
They prepare the dead for burial.

525
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:14,469
I asked him to set the proper example
and resign from our order.

526
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,054
He refused.

527
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,723
You killed him because of his <i>D'jarra?</i>

528
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:23,853
I had to. If a Vedek can't do
what the Emissary has asked of us,

529
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,980
how can we expect anyone else to?

530
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:27,982
Get him out of here.

531
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,912
I regret what happened here today

532
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:44,749
as much as you do,
but change is never easy.

533
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,418
The road that the Prophets
have asked us to walk

534
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,212
won't always be a smooth one.

535
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,756
And forcing people to follow
their <i>D'jarras</i>

536
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,299
won't make it any smoother.

537
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:56,094
What happened on the Promenade
was just the beginning.

538
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,012
Must I remind you, Captain?

539
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:01,099
I'm merely fulfilling
the will of the Prophets.

540
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:03,059
How do you know that?

541
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,229
I'm the Emissary.

542
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,481
And what you've done with the position

543
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,733
has made me wish I had never given it up.

544
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,986
But you did,
and it was the right decision.

545
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,156
You never truly accepted
the role in the first place.

546
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,036
I'm willing to accept it now.

547
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,625
You're challenging my claim.

548
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,794
You've left me no choice.

549
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,965
If we went to the people

550
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,218
and asked them to choose
between us, it would be chaos.

551
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,096
I don't want to divide Bajor
any more than you do.

552
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,390
It wouldn't be divided for long

553
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,475
because in the end,
the people would choose me.

554
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,728
My claim was foretold
in the ancient texts.

555
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:53,609
I was the first to find the wormhole.
I was the first to be with the Prophets.

556
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,112
They gave me back my life.

557
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,490
We're not going to settle
this by arguing over ancient texts.

558
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,159
Then how?

559
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,204
There's only one way to be sure
which one of us is the Emissary.

560
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:09,584
We have to go to the wormhole
and ask the Prophets.

561
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,899
Going to half thrusters.

562
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,651
( sighs )

563
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,655
Now what?

564
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:41,616
We wait.

565
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:11,229
( thudding heartbeat )

566
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,356
You are the Sisko.

567
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,733
This is the one that was injured.

568
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:19,779
Yes, I was. And you gave me back my life,

569
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,906
just as the texts foretold.

570
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,908
Why are you here?

571
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:27,578
To... prove to this nonbeliever

572
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:31,624
that you sent me to put Bajor
back on the right path.

573
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:36,420
Please, tell him you chose me
to be the Emissary.

574
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:40,174
Tell that him that I fulfilled
the ancient prophecies,

575
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:43,678
that I was the first to find
the Celestial Temple.

576
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:47,765
I was the first to meet with you.
He came to you centuries later.

577
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:49,350
First...

578
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:51,686
Later...

579
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,231
They have no meaning to us.

580
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:58,067
SISKO: The Bajorans believe
that you are their Prophets.

581
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,945
That you have chosen
one of us to be your Emissary.

582
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,288
We... are of Bajor.

583
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,039
Go on.

584
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,046
They are linear.

585
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,965
It limits them.

586
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,509
They do not understand.

587
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,761
But we want to understand.

588
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,972
That's why we're here.

589
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,141
You saved his life. Why?

590
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,226
He was injured.

591
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,270
We kept him with us.

592
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,605
So that I would be spared the occupation.

593
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:39,442
So that I could bring
the <i>D'jarras </i>back to Bajor.

594
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,110
Is that true?

595
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,279
Is that what you want?

596
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:48,659
The <i>D'jarras </i>are part of what the Sisko
would call the past.

597
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:53,539
The Sisko taught us that for you,
what was can never be again.

598
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:57,585
If the <i>D'jarras</i> belong in the past,
why did you send me into the future?

599
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:02,798
For the Sisko.

600
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,469
For me?

601
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,347
You're saying that he's your Emissary.

602
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,600
He is the Sisko.

603
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,022
Then I've been wrong...

604
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,398
About everything.

605
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,611
You should have let me die.

606
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,488
We still can.

607
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,449
We can return him

608
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,743
to the moment we found him.

609
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,245
Allow him to die.

610
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,455
No.

611
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:37,666
Why not return him to his own time

612
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:44,298
as he is now, uninjured,
so that he can get back safely to Bajor?

613
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:52,390
He would remember
nothing of what has happened.

614
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:57,061
I could be with my wife and family.

615
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,526
I'm ready to go home.

616
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:06,612
Why?

617
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,532
Why do you stay here?

618
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,742
Because I still have questions.

619
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,704
We are of Bajor.

620
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,249
What does that mean?

621
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,420
<i>You... </i>are of Bajor.

622
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,451
You know, Molly really loves
that book Jake gave her.

623
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,662
She made me read it to her three times
before she fell asleep.

624
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:02,751
( sighs )

625
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,504
I'm going to be working another few hours.

626
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:09,675
-Well, that's okay.
-I'll, uh... I'll read.

627
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,760
If you want to go do something...

628
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:14,263
No. I'm fine.

629
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,644
( sighs )

630
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:27,735
Miles, I promised I wouldn't say anything,
but it's about Julian.

631
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,196
What about him?

632
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:34,283
I ran into him the other day,
and he seemed depressed.

633
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:37,036
He'd never admit it,
but he really misses you.

634
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,412
Poor guy.

635
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,499
No family to come home to every night.

636
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,002
Maybe you should go find him.
You know, cheer him up a little.

637
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,881
-Depressed, is he?
-Very.

638
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:50,549
Maybe I should go spend an hour with him.

639
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:51,926
Maybe two.

640
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,892
I'm a lucky man.

641
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,857
Keiko to Dr. Bashir.

642
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:07,983
<i>Go ahead.</i>

643
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,069
Julian, it's about Miles.

644
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:14,740
<i>I promised I wouldn't tell anyone,</i>
<i>but he's been really depressed lately.</i>

645
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,867
Oh.

646
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,667
I want you to have this.

647
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:28,921
It's an original Kira Nerys.
It could be very valuable one day.

648
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,257
I hear she didn't make many.

649
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,300
( both laughing )

650
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:38,472
I thought your speech
went very well yesterday.

651
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,391
It was the right thing to do.

652
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:43,394
I wanted everyone to know
what happened to Akorem

653
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:47,022
and that the Prophets said nothing
about returning to the <i>D'jarras.</i>

654
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,525
Just about everyone
was relieved to hear it.

655
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:52,278
-It's your own fault.
-I can't believe you didn't cover me.

656
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,822
How was I to know you were going to insult
the King of Leinster?

657
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,323
-Ah!
-In his own keep!

658
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,992
( laughing )

659
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:01,620
I was just reading one of Akorem's poems,
<i>The Call of the Prophets.</i>

660
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,330
Oh, that's one of my favorites.

661
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,249
It's a shame he never finished it.

662
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,376
He did. Look.

663
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,881
This is confusing.

664
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,554
The last time I read this poem,
it ended after the 12th stanza.

665
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,806
If the timeline's been changed,

666
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,059
then why do I remember things
the way they used to be?

667
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:27,313
The Prophets work in mysterious ways.

668
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:30,649
MALE: Excuse me, sir.

669
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,026
Yes?

670
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:36,739
Sorry to bother you, but tomorrow
after evening services in the Temple,

671
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:39,241
we're having my daughter's<i> </i>
<i>ih'tanu </i>ceremony.

672
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:42,620
She's turning 14.

673
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:44,204
Happy birthday.

674
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:49,418
We were wondering if there's any chance
you could come and give her your blessing.

675
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,503
It would mean so much to us.

676
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,297
I'd be happy to.

677
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:56,592
Thank you, Emissary.

678
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:58,636
You're welcome.
