1
00:00:03,601 --> 00:00:06,666
I thought you said you'd started
straightening this place up.

2
00:00:06,709 --> 00:00:08,042
You should have seen it before.

3
00:00:08,079 --> 00:00:10,141
Look, Keiko's shuttle
will be here before we know it.

4
00:00:10,184 --> 00:00:12,018
We should have left
the holosuite hours ago.

5
00:00:12,056 --> 00:00:14,722
What, and let the Jerries
cross the Channel? Never.

6
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:16,998
It is sort of a shame
to pack this stuff away.

7
00:00:17,036 --> 00:00:19,200
Wish we didn't have to.

8
00:00:19,242 --> 00:00:20,677
It's like a sculpture...

9
00:00:20,712 --> 00:00:22,683
a monument to your year
as a bachelor.

10
00:00:22,717 --> 00:00:23,811
Ah, I suppose it is.

11
00:00:23,853 --> 00:00:26,223
Who are we to dismantle
this piece of art?

12
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:27,660
I don't know.

13
00:00:27,697 --> 00:00:30,067
But if we don't,
Keiko'll dismantle me.

14
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:50,649
Daddy.

15
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,524
Hi, sweetie.

16
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:53,791
Oh!

17
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:58,703
Hi.

18
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:09,269
The one good thing
about going away is coming home.

19
00:01:09,372 --> 00:01:11,674
I never want to be
apart like that again.

20
00:01:11,711 --> 00:01:13,511
Daddy, Daddy!

21
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:15,817
I have a little brother.

22
00:01:15,855 --> 00:01:16,754
Really?

23
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:19,629
Is that him?

24
00:01:19,665 --> 00:01:21,568
No. He's in there.

25
00:01:23,174 --> 00:01:24,473
Surprise.

26
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:28,681
A baby?

27
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:32,255
Yeah. I-I thought
you'd be happy.

28
00:01:32,297 --> 00:01:33,766
I mean, we talked about it

29
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,466
and decided we'd start trying.

30
00:01:35,507 --> 00:01:37,067
Oh, I know.

31
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,107
We-We-Well, but your last visit

32
00:01:40,151 --> 00:01:42,247
you were only here
the one night, and...

33
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,854
I thought it'd take
a couple of nights.

34
00:01:44,898 --> 00:01:49,365
To be honest...
a lot more nights.

35
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,211
I guess we just
got lucky this time.

36
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:56,090
I guess so.

37
00:02:02,743 --> 00:02:04,509
Vedek Porta.

38
00:02:04,548 --> 00:02:06,143
Nerys.

39
00:02:06,186 --> 00:02:09,285
So, this is where you are

40
00:02:09,328 --> 00:02:13,065
when you're not at the Temple.

41
00:02:13,104 --> 00:02:15,668
Very impressive.

42
00:02:15,711 --> 00:02:17,807
Haven't you ever been to Ops?

43
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:20,515
What business
would an old monk have here

44
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,791
except maybe helping
a young couple

45
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:24,389
to meet the Emissary?

46
00:02:24,467 --> 00:02:26,962
Are you sure
this is a good time?

47
00:02:27,007 --> 00:02:29,377
I think he'll be
able to fit you in.

48
00:02:29,413 --> 00:02:31,407
Thank you so much
for doing this, Major.

49
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,353
Oh, I'm glad to.

50
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,190
They can take the <i>Rubicon.</i>

51
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:40,437
Come in.

52
00:02:40,474 --> 00:02:41,602
Vedek Porta's here

53
00:02:41,644 --> 00:02:43,946
with the young couple
that just got married.

54
00:02:43,984 --> 00:02:46,422
They're hoping to get
the Emissary's blessing.

55
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,519
Bring them in.

56
00:02:51,403 --> 00:02:52,633
You remember the words?

57
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:53,801
The marriage blessing?

58
00:02:53,843 --> 00:02:54,812
Mm-hmm.

59
00:02:54,845 --> 00:02:55,836
I think so.

60
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,689
Emissary, we're very grateful
to you for seeing us.

61
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:02,756
Not at all.

62
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:04,667
Now, if you'll just
join hands...

63
00:03:08,012 --> 00:03:11,977
<i>Zhia'kala, tar'eh anu suur...</i>

64
00:03:12,023 --> 00:03:16,934
<i>te'von, aka'lu rez...</i>
<i>ka'vor, mat'ana kel.</i>

65
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,269
Thank you.

66
00:03:18,306 --> 00:03:19,970
Thank you very much.

67
00:03:24,556 --> 00:03:27,997
Your accent is getting
much better, Emissary.

68
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:29,899
I'm glad to hear it.

69
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:38,849
It isn't that bad, is it,
being the Emissary?

70
00:03:38,893 --> 00:03:42,357
A few ceremonies,
an occasional blessing.

71
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:44,532
I didn't say it was that bad.

72
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:47,913
It's just hard getting used
to being a religious icon.

73
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,545
Really?

74
00:03:49,621 --> 00:03:50,885
I think I'd like it.

75
00:03:50,924 --> 00:03:51,893
Kira to Sisko.

76
00:03:51,926 --> 00:03:53,054
Go ahead.

77
00:03:53,096 --> 00:03:54,862
You'd better get out here.

78
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,601
There's something
coming through the wormhole.

79
00:04:10,776 --> 00:04:11,745
A lightship.

80
00:04:11,778 --> 00:04:13,008
I don't know where it came from.

81
00:04:13,048 --> 00:04:15,316
According to remote sensors,
it never entered the wormhole.

82
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:16,482
From these readings

83
00:04:16,524 --> 00:04:18,016
I'd say that ship's
about 300 years old.

84
00:04:18,061 --> 00:04:19,189
Life signs?

85
00:04:19,231 --> 00:04:21,499
There's someone on board...
a Bajoran.

86
00:04:21,537 --> 00:04:23,371
Try hailing them.

87
00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:25,346
No response.

88
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,479
Whoever's in there
could be injured.

89
00:04:28,522 --> 00:04:30,790
Tractor the ship
into transporter range

90
00:04:30,828 --> 00:04:33,392
and beam the passenger
directly into the Infirmary.

91
00:04:43,327 --> 00:04:45,195
He's a little disoriented.

92
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:49,567
I'm Captain Benjamin Sisko.

93
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,143
You're aboard a Federation
space station near Bajor.

94
00:04:53,185 --> 00:04:56,159
This is Kira Nerys,
my First Officer.

95
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,033
Who are you?

96
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,739
I am the Emissary.

97
00:07:03,994 --> 00:07:06,296
I was headed back to Bajor.

98
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,134
My lightship was caught
in an ion storm.

99
00:07:09,175 --> 00:07:11,875
It nearly tore it apart.

100
00:07:11,915 --> 00:07:14,444
A girder came loose
from the bulkhead

101
00:07:14,488 --> 00:07:17,188
and impaled me
through the shoulder, here.

102
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:21,797
I remember thinking I was
going to die alone in space

103
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:25,111
when a strange opening
appeared in the sky.

104
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:27,713
I was terrified at first

105
00:07:27,756 --> 00:07:30,958
and then, I realized
what was happening.

106
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:37,378
The Prophets were opening the
gates of the Celestial Temple

107
00:07:37,481 --> 00:07:40,113
and drawing me to them.

108
00:07:40,155 --> 00:07:41,887
What happened then?

109
00:07:41,926 --> 00:07:44,398
It's difficult to describe.

110
00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:47,837
They took the form of people
that I know...

111
00:07:47,874 --> 00:07:50,210
my grandfather, my brother...

112
00:07:50,247 --> 00:07:53,415
so they could
communicate with me.

113
00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:55,016
You spoke to them?

114
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,529
I didn't have to.

115
00:07:56,564 --> 00:07:59,936
I could sense their
understanding, their grace.

116
00:07:59,973 --> 00:08:03,847
I've never felt such bliss.

117
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,013
And then they healed me.

118
00:08:06,055 --> 00:08:08,151
A light washed over me

119
00:08:08,194 --> 00:08:10,666
and then, my wound was gone.

120
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:13,105
They gave me back my life.

121
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:15,773
I felt reborn.

122
00:08:15,814 --> 00:08:18,082
When exactly
did you leave Bajor?

123
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,291
Oh, it couldn't have been
more than a few days ago.

124
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,799
What was the year?

125
00:08:23,835 --> 00:08:25,738
9174.

126
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,787
That was over 200 years ago.

127
00:08:31,823 --> 00:08:34,523
200 years?

128
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:40,744
My wife...

129
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:44,585
my parents... they're gone.

130
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,401
If you give us your name

131
00:08:47,534 --> 00:08:50,234
maybe we can contact
your descendants.

132
00:08:50,274 --> 00:08:53,076
Let them know
you're... a-alive.

133
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,414
Akorem.

134
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:55,944
Akorem Laan.

135
00:08:56,022 --> 00:08:57,890
But I have no descendants.

136
00:08:57,927 --> 00:08:59,898
My brother died last winter

137
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:02,701
and my wife and I
never had children.

138
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,714
Akorem Laan, the poet?

139
00:09:05,748 --> 00:09:07,776
I'm a poet, yes.

140
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,887
You wrote <i>Kitara's Song</i>
and <i>The Call of the Prophets?</i>

141
00:09:11,931 --> 00:09:14,699
You know my work?

142
00:09:14,738 --> 00:09:18,771
You're considered one
of the greatest poets of Bajor.

143
00:09:18,815 --> 00:09:23,418
Every schoolchild can recite
<i>Gaudaal's Lament</i> from memory.

144
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:27,527
People still read my work,
after all this time?

145
00:09:27,572 --> 00:09:32,141
Perhaps that's part
of the Prophets' plan for me.

146
00:09:32,183 --> 00:09:33,311
Their plan?

147
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:37,125
It's not clear to me yet
why they made me their Emissary

148
00:09:37,163 --> 00:09:39,567
but I know they gave me back
my life for a reason.

149
00:09:39,603 --> 00:09:42,371
Akorem,
a great deal has happened

150
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:44,539
since you've been gone.

151
00:09:44,582 --> 00:09:48,889
Maybe Major Kira can spend
some time filling you in.

152
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,598
"Major Kira"?

153
00:09:52,637 --> 00:09:53,901
That's right.

154
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,176
But your family would be part
of the artist <i>D'jarra.</i>

155
00:09:57,215 --> 00:09:58,616
<i>D'jarra?</i>

156
00:10:00,523 --> 00:10:03,052
Bajor used to have
a strict caste system.

157
00:10:03,164 --> 00:10:04,690
A person's work was dictated

158
00:10:04,734 --> 00:10:06,705
by what family
they were born into.

159
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:10,613
You no longer follow
your <i>D'jarras?</i>

160
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:12,677
When the Cardassians
occupied Bajor

161
00:10:12,722 --> 00:10:16,255
we gave up the <i>D'jarras,</i>
so that we could fight them.

162
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:18,269
We all became soldiers.

163
00:10:18,303 --> 00:10:21,675
The Cardassians occupied Bajor?

164
00:10:21,712 --> 00:10:23,512
For over 50 years.

165
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,420
It seems you're right, Captain.

166
00:10:28,463 --> 00:10:31,437
A great deal has happened
since I've been gone.

167
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:42,463
If you look at the prophecies
about the Emissary

168
00:10:42,499 --> 00:10:44,333
a lot of them make
much more sense

169
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,068
with Akorem in the picture.

170
00:10:46,108 --> 00:10:47,304
Really?

171
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:49,715
Every text I've read
says that the Prophets

172
00:10:49,751 --> 00:10:52,816
will name their Emissary
by calling him to them

173
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:55,388
that he would find
the Celestial Temple

174
00:10:55,432 --> 00:10:57,768
that there, the Prophets
would give him back his life.

175
00:10:57,806 --> 00:10:59,207
Go on.

176
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:01,873
They didn't give me
back my life.

177
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,150
Not literally,
but they did help you

178
00:11:04,255 --> 00:11:06,021
get your life back together.

179
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,898
True enough, but I
wasn't the first one

180
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:12,341
to find the wormhole,
or to meet the Prophets.

181
00:11:12,376 --> 00:11:13,572
Akorem was.

182
00:11:13,613 --> 00:11:14,946
Benjamin, I thought

183
00:11:14,983 --> 00:11:17,615
you didn't believe
in the prophecies.

184
00:11:17,657 --> 00:11:19,092
I don't.

185
00:11:19,127 --> 00:11:20,757
Then why are you using them

186
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,861
to justify giving up
your position?

187
00:11:22,904 --> 00:11:25,399
I guess I was looking
for something to convince me

188
00:11:25,444 --> 00:11:27,312
that I was making
the right decision.

189
00:11:27,349 --> 00:11:29,913
So your mind's made up?
You're going to step aside?

190
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:32,325
Akorem will make
a far better Emissary

191
00:11:32,362 --> 00:11:33,388
than I ever was.

192
00:11:33,431 --> 00:11:34,832
He's Bajoran.

193
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:37,933
He's a revered poet,
and he wants the job.

194
00:11:37,976 --> 00:11:40,346
Besides,
Starfleet will be thrilled.

195
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:41,579
They never liked the idea

196
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:43,921
that the Bajorans saw me
as a religious figure.

197
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:45,360
How do you know

198
00:11:45,396 --> 00:11:48,062
the Bajorans will accept Akorem
as their new Emissary?

199
00:11:48,102 --> 00:11:50,130
I talked to Vedek Porta.

200
00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:52,145
He seems to think
that as long as I make it clear

201
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,952
that I'm stepping aside
voluntarily, they will.

202
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,292
So you're off the hook.

203
00:11:58,329 --> 00:11:59,764
How does it feel?

204
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,070
It feels, uh... good.

205
00:12:03,108 --> 00:12:05,238
No more ceremonies to attend.

206
00:12:05,281 --> 00:12:07,411
No more blessings to give.

207
00:12:07,453 --> 00:12:10,153
No more prophecies to fulfill.

208
00:12:10,193 --> 00:12:12,529
I'm just
a Starfleet officer again.

209
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:15,734
All I have to worry about
are the Klingons

210
00:12:15,774 --> 00:12:18,008
the Dominion and the Maquis.

211
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,648
I feel like I'm on vacation.

212
00:12:29,043 --> 00:12:30,444
Chief!

213
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:32,177
Congratulations, Dad.

214
00:12:32,217 --> 00:12:33,516
You heard?

215
00:12:33,554 --> 00:12:34,989
Great news, my friend.

216
00:12:35,024 --> 00:12:36,858
Come have a drink.
Celebrate.

217
00:12:36,896 --> 00:12:38,764
I really should be getting home.

218
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:40,100
Oh, just one.

219
00:12:40,137 --> 00:12:41,606
All right.

220
00:12:41,642 --> 00:12:43,442
Quark, did you hear?

221
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,044
Chief O'Brien is having a baby.

222
00:12:46,087 --> 00:12:49,620
I thought your females
carried your young.

223
00:12:49,662 --> 00:12:51,222
My wife.

224
00:12:51,266 --> 00:12:54,068
My wife is having the baby.

225
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:55,806
Congratulations.

226
00:12:55,845 --> 00:12:58,683
I remember when my nephew Nog
was a baby.

227
00:12:58,719 --> 00:13:01,557
Cutest thing you ever saw.

228
00:13:01,594 --> 00:13:03,758
You know babies.

229
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:07,571
Every little thing they pick up
goes straight into their ears.

230
00:13:07,609 --> 00:13:09,808
Oh, I used to love
reading to him.

231
00:13:09,848 --> 00:13:11,910
You know, "See Brak acquire.

232
00:13:11,953 --> 00:13:15,486
Acquire, Brak, acquire."

233
00:13:17,735 --> 00:13:19,204
Just think.

234
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:21,301
Soon there'll be
two little O'Briens

235
00:13:21,344 --> 00:13:23,042
scampering about underfoot.

236
00:13:23,082 --> 00:13:24,814
Hard to believe, isn't it?

237
00:13:24,854 --> 00:13:26,722
Mind you, they do say
the second one is easier

238
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:29,323
since you've already been
through all the diapers

239
00:13:29,365 --> 00:13:31,894
and the endless crying
and the sleepless nights.

240
00:13:31,939 --> 00:13:33,408
Yeah.

241
00:13:33,442 --> 00:13:34,911
Cheers.

242
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,416
Oh... cheers.

243
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,184
Is something wrong, Chief?

244
00:13:39,225 --> 00:13:41,162
No. Nothing at all.

245
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:42,426
I couldn't be happier.

246
00:13:42,466 --> 00:13:43,435
Did you hear?

247
00:13:43,468 --> 00:13:44,767
Keiko's going to have
another baby.

248
00:13:44,806 --> 00:13:46,139
Now?!

249
00:13:46,176 --> 00:13:47,702
No.

250
00:13:47,746 --> 00:13:49,580
Seven months.

251
00:13:49,618 --> 00:13:51,452
I see.

252
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:53,585
Worf delivered Molly, you know.

253
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:54,598
Really?

254
00:13:54,631 --> 00:13:56,329
The <i>Enterprise</i> was damaged.

255
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:59,468
Keiko and he were trapped
together when her time came.

256
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,504
Oh, well, I'll, uh,
be sure and call you

257
00:14:01,548 --> 00:14:03,143
when she's ready to deliver.

258
00:14:03,186 --> 00:14:04,655
You can lend a hand.

259
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,354
Seven months?

260
00:14:06,395 --> 00:14:10,702
Unfortunately, I will be away
from the station at that time.

261
00:14:12,276 --> 00:14:13,745
Far away.

262
00:14:15,184 --> 00:14:16,653
Visiting my parents

263
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,218
on Earth.

264
00:14:19,262 --> 00:14:21,598
Excuse me.

265
00:14:24,675 --> 00:14:28,846
I don't know who's more anxious
about this baby, you or Worf.

266
00:14:30,858 --> 00:14:31,952
The thing is, Julian

267
00:14:31,994 --> 00:14:34,330
now that Molly's a little older

268
00:14:34,368 --> 00:14:36,966
I was hoping to be able to spend
some time with Keiko again.

269
00:14:37,007 --> 00:14:40,209
I thought we could...
I don't know...

270
00:14:40,249 --> 00:14:42,186
go out at night.

271
00:14:42,221 --> 00:14:43,212
Don't get me wrong.

272
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,228
I know once I hold
my little baby in my arms

273
00:14:45,262 --> 00:14:47,324
I'll be the happiest man
in the world, but...

274
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:50,308
I wasn't expecting it
to happen so soon.

275
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,016
How about a game of darts?

276
00:14:55,054 --> 00:14:56,684
Don't you have to go home?

277
00:14:57,728 --> 00:14:58,719
Yeah.

278
00:15:14,405 --> 00:15:16,639
Major, come to see Akorem speak?

279
00:15:16,677 --> 00:15:18,945
The Emissary's first
public appearance?

280
00:15:18,983 --> 00:15:20,452
I wouldn't miss it.

281
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,789
I'm surprised to hear you
call him that.

282
00:15:22,826 --> 00:15:24,125
Why?

283
00:15:24,163 --> 00:15:27,296
Akorem Laan was...
is a great man.

284
00:15:27,338 --> 00:15:29,400
He's been with the Prophets
for over 200 years

285
00:15:29,444 --> 00:15:30,777
and now they sent
him back to us.

286
00:15:30,814 --> 00:15:32,580
Yes, but two days ago,
you believed

287
00:15:32,652 --> 00:15:34,555
Captain Sisko was the Emissary.

288
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:37,587
Well, he made it clear,
he wants to step aside.

289
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:41,538
Does that mean he never
really was the Emissary?

290
00:15:41,575 --> 00:15:43,774
No.

291
00:15:43,814 --> 00:15:46,845
But they can't both be.

292
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:47,949
I don't know.

293
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:50,463
What do you want from me, Odo?

294
00:15:50,498 --> 00:15:51,797
Forgive me, Major.

295
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:53,829
I don't mean to be difficult

296
00:15:53,874 --> 00:15:55,811
but your faith seems
to have led you

297
00:15:55,845 --> 00:15:57,577
to something of a contradiction.

298
00:15:57,617 --> 00:16:00,419
I don't see it
as a contradiction.

299
00:16:00,457 --> 00:16:02,861
I don't understand.

300
00:16:02,897 --> 00:16:06,065
That's the thing about faith...

301
00:16:06,105 --> 00:16:09,774
if you don't have it,
you can't understand it

302
00:16:09,815 --> 00:16:13,382
and if you do,
no explanation is necessary.

303
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:30,116
Ever since the Prophets
returned me to my people

304
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,628
I've asked myself

305
00:16:31,662 --> 00:16:34,795
the same questions
over and over again.

306
00:16:34,837 --> 00:16:37,936
Why did they keep me
with them for so long?

307
00:16:38,012 --> 00:16:40,678
Why did they return me
to my people now?

308
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,287
I now know the answers.

309
00:16:44,328 --> 00:16:48,065
Bajor suffered a great wound
while I was with the Prophets...

310
00:16:48,105 --> 00:16:50,543
the Cardassian Occupation.

311
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:53,814
The Bajor that I've returned to
has lost its way.

312
00:16:53,854 --> 00:16:56,258
People no longer follow the path

313
00:16:56,293 --> 00:16:58,788
the Prophets
have laid out for them.

314
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:01,500
They no longer follow
their <i>D'jarras.</i>

315
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,708
Artists have become soldiers.

316
00:17:04,748 --> 00:17:06,378
Priests have become merchants.

317
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,915
Farmers have become politicians.

318
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,162
We must heal the wounds
of the occupation.

319
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:15,870
We must return to our <i>D'jarras.</i>

320
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:19,648
We must reclaim what we were
and follow the path

321
00:17:19,687 --> 00:17:21,749
the Prophets
have laid out for us.

322
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:25,997
It is their will that farmers
return to their land

323
00:17:26,104 --> 00:17:29,739
painters to their canvasses,
priests to their temples.

324
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,754
If we do this, if we follow

325
00:17:32,788 --> 00:17:36,389
our <i>D'jarras,</i>
then Bajor will flourish again

326
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:40,271
and become the green
and peaceful land I remember.

327
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:44,045
It will be as if the occupation
never happened.

328
00:17:44,117 --> 00:17:49,928
By returning to our <i>D'jarras,</i>
we will have erased it forever.

329
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:11,578
I wanted to talk to you
before you left for Bajor.

330
00:18:11,622 --> 00:18:12,989
Of course.

331
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,658
I was surprised by your speech.

332
00:18:15,699 --> 00:18:18,365
I had no idea you were going
to advocate change

333
00:18:18,407 --> 00:18:20,469
on such a massive scale.

334
00:18:20,512 --> 00:18:22,882
It's what the Prophets
want for Bajor.

335
00:18:22,918 --> 00:18:25,186
It's why they sent me.

336
00:18:25,224 --> 00:18:26,557
Are you sure of that?

337
00:18:26,594 --> 00:18:27,893
Absolutely.

338
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:30,233
The Emissary knows
that what he's proposing

339
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:33,575
will be difficult
for some people to accept.

340
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,084
He doesn't expect things
to change overnight.

341
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:38,751
So you're not going to ask
First Minister Shakaar

342
00:18:38,792 --> 00:18:41,026
to step down
and go back to farming?

343
00:18:41,065 --> 00:18:42,763
No, of course not.

344
00:18:42,803 --> 00:18:44,774
But frankly,
by the next election

345
00:18:44,808 --> 00:18:47,782
I doubt very many people
will be left on Bajor

346
00:18:47,816 --> 00:18:50,448
who would elect a farmer
to political office.

347
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:53,156
We hope that, eventually,
the people will support

348
00:18:53,263 --> 00:18:56,065
enforcement of the <i>D'jarras</i>
by legal sanction.

349
00:18:56,104 --> 00:18:58,633
So if someone defies
their caste?

350
00:18:58,677 --> 00:19:01,309
Society will have
appropriate remedies

351
00:19:01,351 --> 00:19:03,687
at its disposal
such as deportation.

352
00:19:06,197 --> 00:19:09,661
You realize
that caste-based discrimination

353
00:19:09,706 --> 00:19:12,406
goes against
the Federation Charter.

354
00:19:12,447 --> 00:19:15,045
If Bajor returns
to the <i>D'jarra</i> system

355
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:17,148
I have no doubt
that its petition

356
00:19:17,193 --> 00:19:19,722
to join the Federation
will be rejected.

357
00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:22,034
Kai Winn and I have already
discussed it.

358
00:19:22,071 --> 00:19:24,065
We're willing to make
that sacrifice

359
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,639
in order to follow
the will of the Prophets.

360
00:19:27,686 --> 00:19:31,389
I had a feeling
Winn would see it that way.

361
00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:36,306
Well, the Emissary's
transport leaves shortly.

362
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:43,119
As a Starfleet officer,
I am bound by oath

363
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:45,859
not to interfere
with Bajoran affairs

364
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:50,367
but... as a friend to Bajor

365
00:19:50,412 --> 00:19:53,214
I have to say giving up
Federation membership

366
00:19:53,252 --> 00:19:54,916
would be a mistake.

367
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,275
Oh.

368
00:20:04,415 --> 00:20:06,443
Your <i>pagh</i> is strong.

369
00:20:06,486 --> 00:20:10,121
I see now why Kai Opaka
believed you were the Emissary

370
00:20:10,163 --> 00:20:12,931
and why Winn fears you.

371
00:20:16,647 --> 00:20:18,311
Good-bye, Captain.

372
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:21,381
Good-bye, Emissary.

373
00:20:46,223 --> 00:20:47,692
Morning.

374
00:20:47,727 --> 00:20:50,724
Guess I'll have to take
my <i>raktajino</i> with me.

375
00:20:50,768 --> 00:20:52,237
Please, sit here.

376
00:20:52,272 --> 00:20:55,040
You're not finished.

377
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,314
I'll find someplace else to sit.

378
00:20:57,352 --> 00:20:59,984
You don't have to get up for me.

379
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:01,656
You're <i>lh'valla.</i>

380
00:21:01,696 --> 00:21:03,222
I'm <i>te'nari.</i>

381
00:21:06,844 --> 00:21:09,339
It's been going on
all morning...

382
00:21:09,383 --> 00:21:13,086
whenever someone with a higher-
ranking <i>D'jarra</i> comes in.

383
00:21:16,335 --> 00:21:20,209
I guess I'll have to get used
to being treated like that.

384
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:23,310
I remember when I got
promoted to Lieutenant

385
00:21:23,353 --> 00:21:27,420
it took me a while to get used
to being called "sir"

386
00:21:27,464 --> 00:21:30,028
by my friends
who were still Ensigns.

387
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,734
But that's different.

388
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:35,079
You'd earned the right
to be treated with respect.

389
00:21:35,117 --> 00:21:36,883
I haven't done anything.

390
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:39,018
Sounds like you have
some reservations

391
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,928
about bringing back
the <i>D'jarras.</i>

392
00:21:40,965 --> 00:21:44,337
I have some questions, sure.

393
00:21:44,374 --> 00:21:49,115
The Emissary is asking something
very difficult of us

394
00:21:49,153 --> 00:21:51,455
but we have to have faith

395
00:21:51,492 --> 00:21:54,056
that he's guiding us
towards something.

396
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:56,161
Even if what he's
guiding you towards

397
00:21:56,205 --> 00:21:58,073
doesn't include the Federation?

398
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:02,447
It's not our place
to question the Emissary.

399
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:04,321
No matter what?

400
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,097
Maybe you never realized this,
Captain

401
00:22:08,136 --> 00:22:12,409
but we would have tried to do
whatever you asked of us

402
00:22:12,447 --> 00:22:14,418
when you were Emissary

403
00:22:14,452 --> 00:22:16,686
no matter how difficult
it seemed.

404
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,741
I better get to Ops.

405
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,581
Who are you?

406
00:23:32,622 --> 00:23:34,924
Kai Opaka.

407
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:36,517
Who are you?

408
00:23:36,651 --> 00:23:38,588
What are you doing here?

409
00:23:38,623 --> 00:23:40,526
How did you?

410
00:23:40,561 --> 00:23:43,090
Who are you?

411
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:46,870
Don't you know me?

412
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:48,141
Know you?

413
00:23:48,181 --> 00:23:51,451
How can I know someone
who doesn't know himself?

414
00:24:02,118 --> 00:24:06,060
I think you had what the
Bajorans call an "Orb shadow."

415
00:24:06,094 --> 00:24:09,034
Sometimes, people who have
been exposed to the Orbs

416
00:24:09,069 --> 00:24:11,439
of the Prophets
experience hallucinations

417
00:24:11,475 --> 00:24:13,275
weeks, even months later.

418
00:24:13,313 --> 00:24:14,304
What triggers them?

419
00:24:14,382 --> 00:24:15,749
An excess of neuropeptides.

420
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,188
I can give you an inhibitor

421
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:18,887
to make sure
it never happens again.

422
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:25,908
Of course, if I do,
you risk never finding out.

423
00:24:25,946 --> 00:24:26,972
Finding out what?

424
00:24:27,015 --> 00:24:28,314
The Bajorans believe

425
00:24:28,352 --> 00:24:30,516
you only have a shadow
experience when you ignore

426
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:32,620
what the Prophets'
have been trying to tell you

427
00:24:32,663 --> 00:24:33,757
during an Orb encounter.

428
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:35,998
Interesting.

429
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:40,814
So... any idea what they might
have been trying to tell you?

430
00:24:40,852 --> 00:24:42,823
Sure.

431
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:46,161
That I have too many
neuropeptides

432
00:24:46,198 --> 00:24:49,138
rolling around in my head.

433
00:25:36,028 --> 00:25:38,557
A bird is a difficult
thing to sculpt.

434
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:42,168
Maybe you should have started
with something simpler.

435
00:25:42,211 --> 00:25:44,341
Come in! Come in!

436
00:25:44,383 --> 00:25:46,479
Services are about to begin.

437
00:25:46,555 --> 00:25:49,357
But I can tell I have
no aptitude for it.

438
00:25:49,396 --> 00:25:51,595
That's because you didn't
give yourself over

439
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:52,797
to what you were doing.

440
00:25:52,838 --> 00:25:54,068
How can you say that?

441
00:25:54,108 --> 00:25:55,475
I was up half the night.

442
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:58,918
I have a, a flock of flightless
birds in my quarters.

443
00:25:58,954 --> 00:26:01,256
But you're still
wearing that uniform.

444
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:04,095
You're still clinging
to a false life.

445
00:26:04,134 --> 00:26:06,800
You must do what
the Emissary has asked

446
00:26:06,841 --> 00:26:09,906
and follow your <i>D'jarra</i>
with all your heart

447
00:26:09,949 --> 00:26:11,920
because if you give yourself

448
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:15,224
over to the Prophets,
they will guide you

449
00:26:15,262 --> 00:26:18,464
along the path
they've chosen for you...

450
00:26:18,505 --> 00:26:23,074
and you'll know more joy
than you ever thought possible.

451
00:26:28,531 --> 00:26:29,830
That a girl.

452
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:31,498
Good shot, Molly!

453
00:26:31,538 --> 00:26:32,666
Did I win?

454
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:34,041
We're just practicing.

455
00:26:34,078 --> 00:26:35,513
We'll play a game later.

456
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:36,643
Try another one.

457
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:39,720
Miles?

458
00:26:41,732 --> 00:26:43,031
Oh, uh...

459
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:44,436
that's mine.

460
00:26:44,472 --> 00:26:47,138
Don't worry... I only wear it
in the holosuites.

461
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:49,811
I suppose Julian has one, too.

462
00:26:49,853 --> 00:26:52,485
You two certainly
spent a lot of time

463
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:53,893
in the holosuites.

464
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,490
Well, you should be glad.

465
00:26:55,534 --> 00:26:57,198
It kept me out of trouble.

466
00:26:58,441 --> 00:27:01,415
Remind me to thank Julian
next time I see him.

467
00:27:01,449 --> 00:27:02,782
Mmm...

468
00:27:06,562 --> 00:27:08,465
Want to try for twins?

469
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,735
I don't think it works that way.

470
00:27:10,773 --> 00:27:13,405
You'd better brush up
on your biology.

471
00:27:13,447 --> 00:27:14,916
Teach me.

472
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,858
Look, I drew a pony.

473
00:27:21,101 --> 00:27:22,400
Oh.

474
00:27:22,437 --> 00:27:23,963
Let's see.

475
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:27,950
Does your pony have a name?

476
00:27:27,985 --> 00:27:29,284
I don't know.

477
00:27:29,322 --> 00:27:32,124
Miles, I still have
a lot of specimens

478
00:27:32,162 --> 00:27:34,760
I've got to catalog
for the survey.

479
00:27:34,802 --> 00:27:36,101
Go ahead.

480
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,439
I'll play with Molly.

481
00:27:37,476 --> 00:27:39,640
Oh, Miles, it's good to be home.

482
00:27:41,653 --> 00:27:43,647
Come on, Molly,
let's play darts.

483
00:27:43,693 --> 00:27:46,929
Now, remember what I said
about the right way to stand?

484
00:27:46,968 --> 00:27:48,267
Let's try again.

485
00:27:48,304 --> 00:27:50,275
I don't want to.

486
00:27:52,716 --> 00:27:54,276
Can Daddy color, too?

487
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,314
I'm coloring.

488
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:23,792
The four-shift rotation

489
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,994
also seems to be
improving performance.

490
00:28:26,035 --> 00:28:27,630
Less mistakes due to fatigue.

491
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:30,511
Fine. Let's make
the change permanent.

492
00:28:30,548 --> 00:28:31,881
Anything else?

493
00:28:33,388 --> 00:28:36,190
I was wondering if,
in the next few days

494
00:28:36,229 --> 00:28:39,727
you would have the time
to meet with Major Jatarn.

495
00:28:39,804 --> 00:28:41,296
Sure.

496
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:45,241
Is something wrong, sir?

497
00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:48,453
I'm sorry.

498
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:51,593
I just received a communiqué
from Starfleet Command

499
00:28:51,635 --> 00:28:54,507
responding to my report
on the Bajoran situation.

500
00:28:54,543 --> 00:28:55,944
That bad?

501
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:00,151
Not yet, but I can read
between the lines.

502
00:29:02,096 --> 00:29:06,335
I was sent here to help bring
Bajor into the Federation.

503
00:29:06,374 --> 00:29:09,838
That doesn't look like much
of a possibility anymore.

504
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:12,046
As far as Starfleet
is concerned

505
00:29:12,088 --> 00:29:13,854
I have failed my mission.

506
00:29:13,893 --> 00:29:15,591
That's not fair.

507
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:17,066
It's not your fault.

508
00:29:17,101 --> 00:29:19,767
It is
from where they're sitting.

509
00:29:19,808 --> 00:29:24,411
The irony is,
Starfleet was always trying

510
00:29:24,454 --> 00:29:27,451
to get me to distance myself
from this Emissary business.

511
00:29:27,495 --> 00:29:29,466
And now that I have...

512
00:29:32,775 --> 00:29:35,577
Maybe I could talk
to First Minister Shakaar

513
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:38,454
about sending Starfleet
a communiqué explai...

514
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,789
Thanks.

515
00:29:39,827 --> 00:29:41,627
It-it'll blow over.

516
00:29:41,665 --> 00:29:43,636
It's not that.

517
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:47,635
I guess I'm just feeling...

518
00:29:47,681 --> 00:29:49,584
I did fail.

519
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:51,818
Sir...

520
00:29:51,858 --> 00:29:57,305
Anyway, why did you
want me to meet Jatarn?

521
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:02,084
We can talk about that
another time.

522
00:30:02,118 --> 00:30:03,850
What is it, Major?

523
00:30:05,093 --> 00:30:07,999
I think he'd make
an excellent First Officer.

524
00:30:09,605 --> 00:30:12,100
As soon as you can find
someone to take my post

525
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,978
I'm going to resign
my commission.

526
00:30:15,754 --> 00:30:18,386
To follow your... <i>D'jarra.</i>

527
00:30:18,427 --> 00:30:21,401
I'm planning to move back
to the Dahkur Province.

528
00:30:21,435 --> 00:30:24,534
There are a lot of artists
who live in the capital

529
00:30:24,577 --> 00:30:28,542
and I have a friend there
who's willing to apprentice me.

530
00:30:28,587 --> 00:30:31,059
I'm sorry.

531
00:30:31,093 --> 00:30:36,300
The last thing I want to do
is to add to your problems.

532
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:41,376
This is something I have to do.

533
00:30:48,033 --> 00:30:50,197
If, um...

534
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:52,939
if you don't hit it off
with Major Jatarn, um

535
00:30:52,979 --> 00:30:54,745
I can think
of a few other people.

536
00:30:54,784 --> 00:30:57,883
It shouldn't be that hard
to find someone to replace me.

537
00:30:57,925 --> 00:31:02,996
I don't doubt that I can find
someone to fill your post...

538
00:31:04,943 --> 00:31:07,279
but to replace you?

539
00:31:23,425 --> 00:31:24,894
Computer, time.

540
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:27,058
1921 hours.

541
00:31:27,101 --> 00:31:28,799
Where's Dr. Bashir?

542
00:31:28,838 --> 00:31:31,367
Dr. Bashir is in Quark's bar.

543
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:40,064
Well, I'm chasing a triple
17 and a bull, Morn.

544
00:31:40,101 --> 00:31:41,434
Got some catching up to do.

545
00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:42,530
Chief!

546
00:31:45,147 --> 00:31:46,845
Excuse me.

547
00:31:51,263 --> 00:31:52,664
Julian.

548
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,033
How have you been?

549
00:31:54,071 --> 00:31:55,472
Not bad. You?

550
00:31:55,575 --> 00:31:57,205
Oh, you know, all right.

551
00:31:57,246 --> 00:31:58,944
I was heading home.

552
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:00,783
Thought I'd stop in
for a quick pint.

553
00:32:05,902 --> 00:32:07,371
It's been a while, eh?

554
00:32:07,405 --> 00:32:09,569
Ha. Seems like weeks.

555
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:12,311
I see you found someone
to play darts with.

556
00:32:12,352 --> 00:32:13,321
Oh, uh...

557
00:32:13,354 --> 00:32:14,914
I've set a board up
in our quarters

558
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:16,052
so Molly and I can play.

559
00:32:16,095 --> 00:32:18,259
Well, Morn's, um...
he's pretty good.

560
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,100
So's Molly.

561
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:22,440
- It's not the same.
- It's not the same.

562
00:32:26,021 --> 00:32:29,427
I mean, Molly's just a kid.

563
00:32:29,462 --> 00:32:31,399
You know, we've been
playing with magnets.

564
00:32:31,434 --> 00:32:34,738
Morn couldn't hit a Yridian yak
at five paces.

565
00:32:34,777 --> 00:32:37,945
We were evenly matched.

566
00:32:37,985 --> 00:32:39,352
We had a good rivalry going on.

567
00:32:39,388 --> 00:32:40,448
Yeah, kept us sharp.

568
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:42,121
Exactly.

569
00:32:42,162 --> 00:32:44,133
You're late.

570
00:32:44,168 --> 00:32:46,538
What do you mean?

571
00:32:46,573 --> 00:32:50,640
It's Thursday, and I've got
your usual holosuite reserved.

572
00:32:50,684 --> 00:32:51,880
Didn't you cancel?

573
00:32:51,921 --> 00:32:54,017
Actually, I was, um,
hoping maybe...

574
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:57,762
No, no, I-I-I got to get home.

575
00:32:57,802 --> 00:32:59,362
What about you, Doctor?

576
00:32:59,407 --> 00:33:01,435
The Battle of Britain awaits.

577
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:04,510
And you know my policy
on cancellations...

578
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,523
no refunds.

579
00:33:06,592 --> 00:33:08,061
Go ahead.

580
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,930
Maybe Morn's better
in the cockpit of a spitfire

581
00:33:09,968 --> 00:33:11,460
than he is at darts.

582
00:33:11,505 --> 00:33:13,909
Ah, it wouldn't be the same.

583
00:33:13,945 --> 00:33:16,383
Um. You're right.

584
00:33:16,418 --> 00:33:20,360
Morn probably doesn't
even know where England is.

585
00:33:24,672 --> 00:33:26,404
I'll see you.

586
00:33:36,303 --> 00:33:37,967
Odo to Sisko.

587
00:33:38,008 --> 00:33:39,136
Go ahead.

588
00:33:39,177 --> 00:33:40,909
You'd better come down
to the Promenade.

589
00:33:40,948 --> 00:33:42,144
Someone's been killed.

590
00:33:45,694 --> 00:33:46,958
What happened?

591
00:33:46,997 --> 00:33:47,966
We don't know yet.

592
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,435
He fell from the second level.

593
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,962
His neck was broken on impact.

594
00:33:51,007 --> 00:33:52,408
Did anyone see it happen?

595
00:33:52,445 --> 00:33:54,313
I did.

596
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,152
Was it an accident?

597
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,750
I pushed him.

598
00:33:58,795 --> 00:34:02,328
His family name is Imutta.

599
00:34:02,371 --> 00:34:04,866
Their <i>D'jarra</i> is unclean.

600
00:34:04,911 --> 00:34:07,749
They prepare the dead
for burial.

601
00:34:07,784 --> 00:34:10,052
I asked him to set
the proper example

602
00:34:10,091 --> 00:34:12,062
and resign from our order.

603
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,497
He refused.

604
00:34:13,532 --> 00:34:16,061
You killed him
because of his <i>D'jarra?</i>

605
00:34:16,107 --> 00:34:17,508
I had to.

606
00:34:17,543 --> 00:34:21,212
If a Vedek can't do what
the Emissary has asked of us

607
00:34:21,253 --> 00:34:23,555
how can we expect
anyone else to?

608
00:34:23,592 --> 00:34:26,430
Get him out of here.

609
00:34:36,793 --> 00:34:38,889
I regret
what happened here today

610
00:34:38,932 --> 00:34:41,804
as much as you do,
but change is never easy.

611
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,814
The road that the Prophets
have asked us to walk

612
00:34:44,847 --> 00:34:46,715
won't always be a smooth one.

613
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:48,882
And forcing people
to follow their <i>D'jarras</i>

614
00:34:48,925 --> 00:34:50,725
won't make it any smoother.

615
00:34:50,796 --> 00:34:53,598
What happened on the Promenade
was just the beginning.

616
00:34:53,636 --> 00:34:55,607
Must I remind you, Captain?

617
00:34:55,642 --> 00:34:58,616
I'm merely fulfilling
the will of the Prophets.

618
00:34:58,649 --> 00:35:01,053
How do you know that?

619
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:03,927
I'm the Emissary.

620
00:35:03,964 --> 00:35:06,026
And what you've done
with the position

621
00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:08,337
has made me wish
I had never given it up.

622
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:11,645
But you did,
and it was the right decision.

623
00:35:11,683 --> 00:35:14,919
You never truly accepted
the role in the first place.

624
00:35:17,098 --> 00:35:19,832
I'm willing to accept it now.

625
00:35:21,944 --> 00:35:25,477
You're challenging my claim.

626
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:27,649
You've left me no choice.

627
00:35:29,397 --> 00:35:31,368
If we went to the people

628
00:35:31,402 --> 00:35:34,935
and asked them to choose
between us, it would be chaos.

629
00:35:34,978 --> 00:35:37,780
I don't want to divide Bajor
any more than you do.

630
00:35:37,818 --> 00:35:39,344
It wouldn't be divided

631
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:42,123
for long, because in the end,
the people would choose me.

632
00:35:42,163 --> 00:35:45,331
My claim was foretold
in the ancient texts.

633
00:35:45,371 --> 00:35:48,539
I was the first
to find the wormhole.

634
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:51,347
I was the first to be
with the Prophets.

635
00:35:51,387 --> 00:35:53,825
They gave me back my life.

636
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,529
We're not going to settle this
by arguing over ancient texts.

637
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,734
Then how?

638
00:35:59,775 --> 00:36:04,116
There's only one way to be sure
which one of us is the Emissary.

639
00:36:04,153 --> 00:36:07,617
We have to go to the wormhole
and ask the Prophets.

640
00:36:28,416 --> 00:36:30,387
Going to half thrusters.

641
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,972
Now what?

642
00:36:38,007 --> 00:36:39,476
We wait.

643
00:37:08,554 --> 00:37:10,788
You are the Sisko.

644
00:37:10,826 --> 00:37:13,128
This is the one
that was injured.

645
00:37:13,165 --> 00:37:14,999
Yes, I was.

646
00:37:15,037 --> 00:37:19,174
And you gave me back my life,
just as the texts foretold.

647
00:37:19,214 --> 00:37:21,208
Why are you here?

648
00:37:21,253 --> 00:37:25,025
To... prove to this nonbeliever

649
00:37:25,063 --> 00:37:29,096
that you sent me to put Bajor
back on the right path.

650
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:34,279
Please, tell him you chose me
to be the Emissary.

651
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,921
Tell that him that I fulfilled
the ancient prophecies

652
00:37:37,963 --> 00:37:41,131
that I was the first
to find the Celestial Temple.

653
00:37:41,171 --> 00:37:42,971
I was the first
to meet with you.

654
00:37:43,076 --> 00:37:45,708
He came to you centuries later.

655
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,516
First...

656
00:37:47,554 --> 00:37:49,788
later...

657
00:37:49,827 --> 00:37:52,663
They have no meaning to us.

658
00:37:52,796 --> 00:37:55,064
The Bajorans believe
that you are their Prophets.

659
00:37:55,102 --> 00:37:58,099
That you have chosen one of us
to be your Emissary.

660
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:07,766
We... are of Bajor.

661
00:38:07,802 --> 00:38:09,466
Go on.

662
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,851
They are linear.

663
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:17,758
It limits them.

664
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,963
They do not understand.

665
00:38:21,003 --> 00:38:23,167
But we want to understand.

666
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:25,008
That's why we're here.

667
00:38:25,046 --> 00:38:27,108
You saved his life.
Why?

668
00:38:27,152 --> 00:38:28,782
He was injured.

669
00:38:28,823 --> 00:38:30,418
We kept him with us.

670
00:38:30,494 --> 00:38:33,866
So that I would be spared
the occupation.

671
00:38:33,902 --> 00:38:36,374
So that I could bring
the <i>D'jarras</i> back to Bajor.

672
00:38:36,409 --> 00:38:37,901
Is that true?

673
00:38:37,947 --> 00:38:40,419
Is that what you want?

674
00:38:40,453 --> 00:38:45,626
The <i>D'jarras</i> are part of what
the Sisko would call the past.

675
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:48,138
The Sisko taught us that for you

676
00:38:48,173 --> 00:38:50,372
what was can never be again.

677
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:52,714
If the <i>D'jarras</i>
belong in the past

678
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:54,449
why did you send me
into the future?

679
00:38:58,299 --> 00:39:00,999
For the Sisko.

680
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,774
For me?

681
00:39:03,813 --> 00:39:07,687
You're saying
that he's your Emissary.

682
00:39:07,723 --> 00:39:09,785
He is the Sisko.

683
00:39:12,469 --> 00:39:14,440
Then I've been wrong...

684
00:39:14,474 --> 00:39:18,177
about everything.

685
00:39:18,217 --> 00:39:20,485
You should have let me die.

686
00:39:20,557 --> 00:39:22,551
We still can.

687
00:39:24,133 --> 00:39:28,304
We can return him
to the moment we found him.

688
00:39:28,344 --> 00:39:30,144
Allow him to die.

689
00:39:30,182 --> 00:39:32,278
No.

690
00:39:32,321 --> 00:39:35,420
Why not return him
to his own time

691
00:39:35,463 --> 00:39:37,799
as he is now... uninjured...

692
00:39:37,835 --> 00:39:41,241
so that he can get
back safely to Bajor?

693
00:39:45,689 --> 00:39:49,324
He would remember nothing
of what has happened.

694
00:39:50,502 --> 00:39:54,035
I could be
with my wife and family.

695
00:39:58,355 --> 00:40:00,519
I'm ready to go home.

696
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:03,590
Why?

697
00:40:05,006 --> 00:40:06,498
Why do you stay here?

698
00:40:06,543 --> 00:40:09,345
Because I still have questions.

699
00:40:09,384 --> 00:40:12,620
We are of Bajor.

700
00:40:12,725 --> 00:40:15,220
What does that mean?

701
00:40:15,265 --> 00:40:20,108
You... are of Bajor.

702
00:40:47,783 --> 00:40:50,415
You know, Molly really loves
that book Jake gave her.

703
00:40:50,456 --> 00:40:52,690
She made me read it
to her three times

704
00:40:52,729 --> 00:40:54,164
before she fell asleep.

705
00:41:00,282 --> 00:41:02,344
I'm going to be working
another few hours.

706
00:41:02,388 --> 00:41:04,222
Well, that's okay.

707
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,528
I'll, uh... I'll read.

708
00:41:06,565 --> 00:41:08,833
If you want
to go do something...

709
00:41:08,871 --> 00:41:11,400
No. I'm fine.

710
00:41:18,363 --> 00:41:22,636
Miles, I promised
I wouldn't say anything

711
00:41:22,674 --> 00:41:25,044
but it's about Julian.

712
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,244
What about him?

713
00:41:27,286 --> 00:41:31,353
I ran into him the other day
and he seemed depressed.

714
00:41:31,397 --> 00:41:34,131
He'd never admit it,
but he really misses you.

715
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:35,765
Poor guy.

716
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:38,940
No family
to come home to every night.

717
00:41:38,983 --> 00:41:40,316
Maybe you should go find him.

718
00:41:40,353 --> 00:41:42,552
You know, cheer him up a little.

719
00:41:42,592 --> 00:41:44,756
Depressed, is he?

720
00:41:44,798 --> 00:41:45,994
Very.

721
00:41:46,034 --> 00:41:47,800
Maybe I should go spend
an hour with him.

722
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,068
Maybe two.

723
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:57,051
I'm a lucky man.

724
00:42:02,243 --> 00:42:03,873
Keiko to Dr. Bashir.

725
00:42:03,914 --> 00:42:05,247
Go ahead.

726
00:42:05,284 --> 00:42:07,221
Julian, it's about Miles.

727
00:42:07,256 --> 00:42:09,352
I promised
I wouldn't tell anyone

728
00:42:09,396 --> 00:42:11,925
but he's been
really depressed lately.

729
00:42:13,172 --> 00:42:14,904
Oh.

730
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,623
I want you to have this.

731
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,654
It's an original Kira Nerys.

732
00:42:23,698 --> 00:42:26,296
It could be
very valuable one day.

733
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:28,607
I hear she didn't make many.

734
00:42:33,157 --> 00:42:35,857
I thought your speech
went very well yesterday.

735
00:42:35,897 --> 00:42:37,595
It was the right thing to do.

736
00:42:37,635 --> 00:42:40,541
I wanted everyone to know
what happened to Akorem

737
00:42:40,576 --> 00:42:42,878
and that the Prophets
said nothing

738
00:42:42,915 --> 00:42:45,079
about returning to the <i>D'jarras.</i>

739
00:42:45,121 --> 00:42:46,716
Just about everyone
was relieved to hear it.

740
00:42:46,758 --> 00:42:47,886
It's your own fault.

741
00:42:47,962 --> 00:42:49,796
I can't believe
you didn't cover me.

742
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:52,328
How was I to know you were going
to insult the King of Leinster?

743
00:42:52,373 --> 00:42:53,364
- Ah!
- In his own keep!

744
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,444
I was just reading
one of Akorem's poems...

745
00:42:57,486 --> 00:42:58,853
<i>The Call of the Prophets.</i>

746
00:42:58,891 --> 00:43:00,828
Oh, that's one of my favorites.

747
00:43:00,862 --> 00:43:02,526
It's a shame
he never finished it.

748
00:43:02,567 --> 00:43:04,629
He did. Look.

749
00:43:08,315 --> 00:43:10,252
This is confusing.

750
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:15,757
The last time I read this poem,
it ended after the 12th stanza.

751
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,035
If the timeline's been changed

752
00:43:18,073 --> 00:43:21,537
then why do I remember things
the way they used to be?

753
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:24,648
The Prophets work
in mysterious ways.

754
00:43:25,961 --> 00:43:27,396
Excuse me, sir.

755
00:43:27,431 --> 00:43:29,493
Yes?

756
00:43:29,537 --> 00:43:31,941
Sorry to bother you,
but tomorrow

757
00:43:32,043 --> 00:43:33,638
after evening services
in the Temple

758
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,414
we're having my daughter's
<i>ih'tanu</i> ceremony.

759
00:43:37,925 --> 00:43:39,919
She's turning 14.

760
00:43:39,963 --> 00:43:41,627
Happy birthday.

761
00:43:41,668 --> 00:43:44,436
We were wondering
if there's any chance

762
00:43:44,475 --> 00:43:46,743
you could come and give
her your blessing.

763
00:43:46,781 --> 00:43:48,809
It would mean so much to us.

764
00:43:48,853 --> 00:43:50,687
I'd be happy to.

765
00:43:52,295 --> 00:43:53,993
Thank you, Emissary.

766
00:43:54,067 --> 00:43:56,596
You're welcome.
