1
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:10,970
The usual, Odo?

2
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,179
Nothing.

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,555
The usual.

4
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,724
If all my customers
were like you

5
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:18,477
my family would be begging
in the Promenade.

6
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:20,270
Oh, I seriously
doubt that--

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,940
not as long as there
is a Miradorn raider

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,984
for you to do
business with.

9
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:28,654
Raider? You mean the Miradorn
ship that just docked?

10
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:29,864
The raider.

11
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:31,866
Its reputation, like mine

12
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:34,201
has probably
been exaggerated.

13
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,454
Anyway, I don't know
the ship or its crew.

14
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,165
You didn't make
your usual welcome call

15
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,417
inviting them in
for a free drink?

16
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:45,295
The Miradorns are
a quarrelsome people.

17
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,882
I chose to forego
the usual amenities.

18
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:51,301
He looks away whenever
we make eye contact.

19
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,469
Who?

20
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,846
The new arrival--

21
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:56,056
the one the Klingons
brought back

22
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,725
from the Gamma Quadrant.

23
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,518
Croden? He's harmless.

24
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:03,522
Really? How is it you've
come to know him so well?

25
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:06,734
A man comes in for a drink,
he wants to talk.

26
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:09,695
He didn't seem to want
to talk much to Sisko

27
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:10,738
when he arrived.

28
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,614
Who would?

29
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,491
All those Starfleet officers
greeting him at the airlock--

30
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,951
it would scare me, too.

31
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,745
The Federation could
learn a few things

32
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,788
from the Ferengi
about hospitality.

33
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,708
They scared him, huh?

34
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,209
Of course.

35
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,670
I wonder what he has
to be scared about.

36
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,963
(<i> door opening</i> )

37
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:44,563
Well, now.

38
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:47,608
I believe a pair
of twinned Miradorn

39
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,484
just nodded your way.

40
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:54,031
I'm the man behind the bar.

41
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:57,743
Obviously, they want
to use a holosuite.

42
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:02,664
You think the whole galaxy is
plotting around you, don't you?

43
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,292
Paranoia must run
in your species, Odo.

44
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,878
Maybe that's why
no one has ever seen

45
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,504
another shape-shifter--

46
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,298
they're all hiding!

47
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:14,843
I won't have you coming here
harassing my customers.

48
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,471
Order a drink,
play the tables

49
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,307
or vacate the premises!

50
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,938
(<i> softly</i> ):
Rom, bring a flask
of my special langour.

51
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:27,230
(<i> snarls</i> )

52
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:02,886
MIRADORN 1:
1,000 bars of
gold-pressed latinum.

53
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,679
MIRADORN 2:
Nonnegotiable.

54
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,103
Ahh.

55
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:18,193
Oh, very nice.

56
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,947
Unfortunately, uh,
there's a problem.

57
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,323
Problem?

58
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,324
Langour, anyone?

59
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,659
What problem?

60
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,077
The buyer has
backed out.

61
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,829
You guaranteed us a buyer.

62
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:29,871
A question

63
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,248
has been raised

64
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,125
about the origin
of this bauble.

65
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,919
A similar one was taken
during a raid

66
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,214
on a Vanoben transport
just two light-years from here.

67
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,925
If you had
a bill of sale...

68
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,678
You didn't ask
for any bill of sale

69
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,345
when we contacted you.

70
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:49,016
You will find another buyer.

71
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,601
A buyer who asks
no questions?

72
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,812
That could take
a long time.

73
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:56,564
We don't have a long time.

74
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,818
Just stay, stay,
stay where you are, please.

75
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,361
What's this?

76
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,780
Don't fire!

77
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,782
What do you want?

78
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,784
No one is going to get hurt.

79
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,286
Just... just give me that.

80
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,537
MIRADORN 2:
Whoever you are

81
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,580
you're making a mistake.

82
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,373
Well, it wouldn't be the first

83
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,168
and probably
won't be the last.

84
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,169
Give that to me.

85
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,175
(<i> grunting</i> )

86
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,476
(<i> groans</i> )

87
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,605
(<i> grunting</i> )

88
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,902
Security and medical
to Holosuite One.

89
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:45,364
Five glasses
for four people?

90
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:46,990
(<i> panting</i> )

91
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,243
He's dead.

92
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,744
My brother.

93
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:56,583
(<i> door opens</i> )

94
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,171
Take them all

95
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,630
to security.

96
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,424
Yes, take them both
to his office.

97
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,094
Thank goodness

98
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,136
you were close by, Odo.

99
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,137
All of them.

100
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,513
Get out. Go on.

101
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,685
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

102
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,437
(<i> steady tone</i> )

103
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,992
Have you known
any twinned Miradorn, Commander?

104
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,827
I haven't met
any before now.

105
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:36,456
In my species,
we are not just twin brothers.

106
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,583
Together, we are
a single self...

107
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,918
(<i> labored breathing</i> )

108
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,380
two halves of one being.

109
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,382
I am incomplete now.

110
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,384
You should have
considered the risks

111
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,636
before trying
to sell stolen property.

112
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,138
You have no proof.

113
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,389
Two people were killed
on the transport

114
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,640
this object was taken from.

115
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,100
My brother and I
purchased it

116
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,601
from a passing
Altairian trader.

117
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,020
His name?
His ship's identification?

118
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,939
I am the one whose brother
was killed, Commander!
You have only yourself...

119
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,066
I'd like for you to return
to your ship now!

120
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,860
You have my sympathies

121
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,946
but there may
be more questions.

122
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,240
Please don't
leave the station.

123
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,743
I want to deal with the one
who killed my twin.

124
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,204
The law will
deal with him.

125
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:27,424
My only purpose
in life from here on

126
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:31,011
is to see him dead.

127
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,850
Well...

128
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,645
can't say I didn't warn
you about Miradorns, Odo.

129
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,231
I assume we
are free to go?

130
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,942
Do you have enough evidence
to hold them, Constable?

131
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,445
As Odo will be
happy to confirm

132
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:52,073
I was just as concerned
as everyone else

133
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:55,243
that this was
a stolen objet d'art.

134
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,830
Yes. Curious,
but it's true.

135
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:03,084
We'll be
on our way then.

136
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,337
You know what else
is curious?

137
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:10,050
It's curious that Croden
had a Ferengi phaser.

138
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:14,429
Available in many a port.

139
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,140
And it's curious
that he knew

140
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,268
the Miradorn were
trying to sell you

141
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,354
something of value.

142
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:25,190
How dare you suggest
that my brother

143
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,607
set up this robbery!

144
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:30,195
What an interesting
theory, Rom.

145
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:33,614
If that theory should
ever reach the Miradorn

146
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,992
I'd wake up dead
one morning.

147
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,744
So, I'd appreciate

148
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:42,457
your not spreading wild
theories about casually.

149
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,630
Lobeless idiot,
next time...

150
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,517
Don't you feed your prisoners?

151
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,852
The fact that you
just killed a man

152
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,896
doesn't affect
your appetite?

153
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,814
It was him or me.

154
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,859
And if he had killed me,
I wouldn't be hungry now.

155
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,236
I want you to understand

156
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,113
exactly what's
going to happen.

157
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,573
There will be a trial

158
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,408
to determine
your guilt or innocence.

159
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:18,118
We can assign an advocate

160
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,620
or you can request one
from your home world.

161
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,998
I doubt if anyone on Rakhar
would much care.

162
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,459
Really?

163
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,586
Isn't murder considered
a serious crime

164
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,212
where you come from?

165
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,423
On Rakhar,
all crimes are serious...

166
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,341
only there are no trials.

167
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,343
It's a shame that our first
encounter with your species

168
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,305
had to take place
under such circumstances.

169
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,599
I'm sorry if I made
things awkward.

170
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,435
I didn't have much choice.

171
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:44,478
Why not?

172
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:45,520
My needs

173
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,441
exceed my skills.

174
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:52,735
Now, if I had<i> his</i> talents

175
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,113
I would have
no problems at all.

176
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,031
I've never heard
of a changeling

177
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,033
with such
versatility.

178
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,160
A<i> what?!</i>

179
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,870
A changeling, like you.

180
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,460
You've heard
of other shape-shifters

181
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,295
in the Gamma Quadrant?

182
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,464
Haven't they come
through the wormhole yet?

183
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:13,923
I assumed,
when I saw you...

184
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,592
It's a lie.

185
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,385
He heard me talking
in the bar to Quark.

186
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,597
Well, maybe I dissemble
a little.

187
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,807
"Lie" is a hard word.

188
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,476
But shape-shifters

189
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,520
are harsh
in their judgments.

190
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,397
Feed me

191
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:34,110
and maybe I'll tell you
where I met someone

192
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,488
just like you.

193
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,832
I don't see
that we have any choice.

194
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,459
We have to contact his planet.

195
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,752
Not the best way
of introducing ourselves.

196
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,172
Homicide as a means
to open relations--

197
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,257
it's not exactly how they
teach it at the Academy, is it?

198
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,925
I think you're
all wrong.

199
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,219
How's that?

200
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,637
They're going
to thank us.

201
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:01,929
Thank us?

202
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,098
Oh, that's
what I'd do.

203
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,643
He's probably committed
all sorts of crimes
in their system.

204
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,396
They'll be glad to have the
problem taken off their hands.

205
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,398
There's only one way
to find out. Dax?

206
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,483
It won't be hard
to find Rakhar.

207
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,026
According to the logs

208
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,278
Croden was found
in a damaged shuttlecraft

209
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,406
about three light-years
from the wormhole.

210
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:23,410
There aren't many
M-Class planets in that area.

211
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,203
You're with me.

212
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,705
Major Kira, as long
as the Miradorn ship is here

213
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,331
there's a threat to Croden.

214
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,957
I don't want to have
to tell his people

215
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,043
that he was killed
while in our custody.

216
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,671
I'll have Odo
increase security.

217
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,563
Stop in to see
if I'd run away?

218
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:52,813
(<i> scoffs</i> )

219
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,065
I couldn't get that lucky.

220
00:12:56,359 --> 00:13:01,239
That Croden
is an interesting character.

221
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,616
I wouldn't know.

222
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,409
Really?

223
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,454
I thought you said
you got to know him rather well.

224
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,497
I never told you that.

225
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:13,084
I merely said we chatted
when he bought a drink or two.

226
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:16,795
I've talked to several people
who saw the two of you

227
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,673
engaged in heavy
conversations.

228
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:21,593
Why, Morn, here, says you even
bought the fellow a meal.

229
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:25,305
Morn should keep
his big mouth shut.

230
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:33,104
So what were you
talking to him about?

231
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:36,023
Just being friendly.

232
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,485
He was...

233
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,279
so out of place
here-- alone.

234
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,407
I felt sorry for him.

235
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:48,286
You should sympathize
with my kindness.

236
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,497
There's no profit
in kindness.

237
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,874
You attribute odious motives
to my every charitable act.

238
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:57,337
That's because your favorite
charity is your own pocket.

239
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,256
Speaking of odious motives

240
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,592
I hear you've
been making inquiries

241
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:06,053
about finding a small ship
to go through the wormhole.

242
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,222
That has nothing to do
with any of this.
I think it does.

243
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,308
I think you were trying
to secure passage

244
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,268
back to the Gamma Quadrant
for Croden

245
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:15,146
in exchange for staging this
tragic little robbery of yours.

246
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:18,441
This could turn into
a much bigger tragedy for me

247
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,777
if you don't
keep your voice down.

248
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,488
What did Croden
tell you about himself?

249
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,072
Nothing.

250
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,534
We didn't talk about
anything except business.

251
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,369
Inconsequential things.

252
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,079
What's inconsequential to
you may be important to me.

253
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,290
Did he say anything
about his home world?

254
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,834
No.

255
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:38,378
Other species in
the Gamma Quadrant?

256
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,171
No.

257
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:41,506
Security to Odo.

258
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,508
Go ahead.

259
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,635
Ah-Kel and his crew are blocking
the entrance to your office.

260
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:46,927
Should we clear them out?

261
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,847
Leave it. I'll handle them.

262
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,232
You were told
to stay on your ship.

263
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,025
Understand me, shape-shifter.

264
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:05,488
He killed the part of me
that made existence bearable.

265
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:09,200
I cannot stop
until I kill him.

266
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,285
You're not going
to kill anyone.

267
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,120
Get back to your ship
and stay there.

268
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,248
If I find you here again,
I'll lock you up, too.

269
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:41,107
You've made a lot of friends
in your short stay here.

270
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:44,235
Well, I guess you'd
know how that feels.

271
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:47,572
You and I have a great deal
in common, changeling.

272
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,657
We have nothing
in common.

273
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,576
We are both aliens here...

274
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:54,370
the only ones of our kind.

275
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,330
Each of us is alone

276
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,416
isolated,
shut out.

277
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,167
Others like us

278
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,754
only exist
in the Gamma Quadrant.

279
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,299
I have always wondered

280
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:10,970
why changelings are so
distrustful of other species.

281
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,600
I doubt the changelings
on your world

282
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,560
would trust you.

283
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,145
Of course not.

284
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,314
There are no shape-shifters
on Rakhar.

285
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,649
You just said...

286
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,445
You implied there were.

287
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,781
I'm sorry if I misled you.

288
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,909
There were shape-shifters
on Rakhar at one time

289
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:34,828
but that was
centuries ago.

290
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,454
What happened to them?

291
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:39,248
They were persecuted.

292
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,875
Driven out.

293
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,258
But I know a place
where there are still some left.

294
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,052
Of course,
that was a few years ago.

295
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,471
And if you
had the chance

296
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,139
you'd take me there.

297
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,600
Sure, I would.

298
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,143
Why not?

299
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,854
Tell me where it is,
I'll have a look.

300
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,731
Ah... No, I...

301
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,566
I have to show you.

302
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:08,235
There is no way that you could
find it on your own.

303
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,989
The next time you lie

304
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:13,908
I'll save Ah-Kel
the trouble of killing you.

305
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:16,202
There's that hard word again.

306
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,624
There are times
when I don't dissemble.

307
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,710
Whatever you call it

308
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,753
the truth isn't in you.

309
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:35,638
From the colony
of the changelings.

310
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,140
We're in orbit.

311
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,851
Open hailing frequency.

312
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,519
Open.

313
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,022
This is the Federation Starship
<i>Rio Grande</i>

314
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,274
attempting to make contact
with the planet Rakhar.

315
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,192
Please respond.

316
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:37,533
One of your people
committed a homicide

317
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,326
and we have him in custody.

318
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,120
His name is Croden.

319
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,958
I'm picking up a signal
in the southern hemisphere.

320
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,500
They're hailing us.

321
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,087
On screen.

322
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:51,422
I am the Exarch
of Nehelik Province.

323
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:54,383
You will transport Croden
to this location.

324
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,343
I'm afraid we haven't
brought him with us.

325
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,137
Your communication
clearly stated

326
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,597
that he was in your custody.

327
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,181
On our space station.

328
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,768
Perhaps I should explain
where we come from.

329
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,561
We are well aware of the traffic

330
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,146
through the newly discovered
passage.

331
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,856
We simply have no interest

332
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,190
in contact with anyone
from your Quadrant.

333
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,859
I am sorry to hear that

334
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,612
but we certainly will
respect your wishes.

335
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:18,324
We just felt it was necessary
after Croden was arrested.

336
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,242
Croden is an enemy
of the Rakhari people!

337
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,996
We request that
he be returned immediately.

338
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,372
He's scheduled to be tried
for his crime on our station.

339
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:29,251
Tried? Croden has already been
declared guilty in absentia

340
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,295
for myriad crimes on this world.

341
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,048
That judgment supersedes
your charges.

342
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:37,593
Return him, and I can assure you
his punishment will be

343
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,054
appropriate to your crime
as well as ours.

344
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,722
I would feel more comfortable
if we could find...

345
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,142
I do not know what kind
of people you are--

346
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:47,103
I do not care to know--
but if your society purports

347
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,147
to respect the rules
of our society

348
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:51,273
you will return him
without delay.

349
00:19:55,402 --> 00:20:00,240
Expect him to return
in a vessel just like this one

350
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,659
within 52 hours.

351
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,257
It's an amalgam
of organic material

352
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,969
and some sort
of crystal.

353
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:23,222
You mean... it's alive.

354
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,640
More or less.

355
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,851
It's almost like
a transitional phase

356
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,103
between organic
and inorganic matter.

357
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,105
I've only seen
one life-form

358
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,273
that even remotely
resembles it.

359
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,608
Me.

360
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,361
In a way...

361
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,406
this stone
might qualify

362
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,116
as a distant
cousin of yours.

363
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,243
Maybe there's a clue
to your origins here.

364
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,828
Where did it come from?

365
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:50,290
Unfortunately,
the only one who can tell me

366
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,710
is less reliable than Quark.

367
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,729
How do you like
my stone, changeling?

368
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,147
Where'd you get it?

369
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:16,150
What would
telling you get me?

370
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,401
Nothing.

371
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,070
Ah.

372
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,529
Well, that's too bad.

373
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,656
I was hoping
you'd feel sorry for me

374
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,742
seeing as we're
the only two here

375
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:26,869
from the other side
of the passage.

376
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,996
I feel nothing for
you but contempt.

377
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:32,708
You're a thief and a killer,
and who knows what else.

378
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,334
Typical. It's typical.

379
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,295
Of "changeling
behavior"?

380
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,797
Yes, I'm sure.

381
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,215
Uh, excuse me.

382
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,646
In my sector

383
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,564
there is a nebula
called the Chamra Vortex.

384
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,151
There are millions
of asteroids in it.

385
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,903
I found this stone
on one of them.

386
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:03,614
I could take you to it,
changeling.

387
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,866
Others must know
where it is.

388
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:09,162
No, no, the Vortex
is uncharted but, as a thief

389
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:11,831
and a killer and who knows what,
I hid there often.

390
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:15,501
I found this colony
of changelings by chance

391
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,254
and I know my way back.

392
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,971
(<i> door chimes</i> )

393
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,472
Come in.

394
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:32,935
Yes, Commander?

395
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,813
Constable, I want you
to escort the prisoner

396
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:37,439
back to his home planet.

397
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:43,821
He's... not to stand trial...
here?

398
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:46,657
Croden apparently
committed crimes on Rakhar.

399
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,242
His government is adamant

400
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:49,743
and the Bajorans have agreed
to release him.

401
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,829
We're going
to have trouble

402
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:54,165
getting him past
the Miradorn.

403
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:55,499
Yes, I know.

404
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,709
Ah-Kel's been
screening every ship

405
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:57,751
leaving this station.

406
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,673
How soon
can you be ready?

407
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,217
I'm ready now.

408
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:05,885
There's a Rigelian freighter

409
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,928
leaving here for the Gamma
Quadrant in an hour.

410
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,930
Maybe we can use them
to run interference

411
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,599
between you
and the Miradorn ship.

412
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,519
I'll move the prisoner
to the runabout right away.

413
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,189
Constable, once you're
on the other side

414
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,066
you'll be on your own.

415
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:23,194
The Miradorn vessel can
outrun any of our runabouts

416
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:25,029
and, if they
do come after you

417
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:28,282
a warning from us will
just point an arrow to you.

418
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:29,575
Understood.

419
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,765
So you're finally
taking me up on my offer.

420
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:55,893
I'm taking you home.

421
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:01,857
O'BRIEN:
Commander.

422
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:07,321
The Rigelian freighter's
ready for departure.

423
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:08,488
Signal Odo.

424
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,586
KIRA:
The Miradorn ship

425
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,755
is scanning the freighter.

426
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:28,717
Doesn't look like
they're reading the runabout.

427
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:49,363
How do you stand it,
changeling?

428
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:52,158
Living where you don't belong?

429
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,165
Are you happy?

430
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:02,918
I'm as much a part
of the place
as anyone else.

431
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,502
Oh, I doubt it.

432
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:06,839
They tolerate you,
but you're not one of them.

433
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,506
Being what you are

434
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:11,218
you can pour your square shape
into a round hole

435
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,761
but you don't
really fit, do you?

436
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,138
You're like my stone.

437
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,015
I think
I finally figured out

438
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,225
what crime you were
found guilty of on your world.

439
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,310
What's that?

440
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,560
You talk too much.

441
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,189
(<i> laughs</i> )

442
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:25,399
Maybe you're right.

443
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:28,194
Perhaps that<i> is</i>
how it started.

444
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:32,365
Perhaps I asked
one question too many.

445
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:35,784
Anyway, that's as good
an explanation as any.

446
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,412
Explanation
for what?

447
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,500
For why they
came that night.

448
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:48,214
I was never told, and,
to this day, I don't know.

449
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,424
They broke into my home
just before dawn

450
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,385
and, before I had time
to stop them

451
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:54,094
they had murdered
both my wives.

452
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,474
You see...

453
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,100
on my world

454
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,020
the punishment for being
an enemy of the people

455
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,105
is the death
of your family.

456
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:08,067
I had no
sophisticated weapon...

457
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,444
only a short slaughter knife

458
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:14,031
that I used for cutting
the necks of fowl

459
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,450
that we would
prepare for supper.

460
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,453
Imagine my surprise
when I discovered

461
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:22,415
that the necks
of the security officers

462
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:26,502
were no more difficult
to cut than the birds'.

463
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,462
Even the sound they made

464
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:33,008
as the blade crossed
their gullets were similar.

465
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:36,678
You expect me

466
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,638
to believe this
appalling tale?

467
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:41,641
Would it make any
difference if you did?

468
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:42,768
No.

469
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,313
Well, then believe it

470
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:49,316
because it's true.

471
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:52,694
Oh, my return
will be celebrated, changeling.

472
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,113
They'll be very grateful.

473
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,531
You'll be a hero.

474
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,366
Perhaps
you might even use this

475
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,493
as an excuse
to exchange envoys.

476
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,328
If you don't stop talking

477
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,372
I could sedate you
for the rest of the trip.

478
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,334
Sorry. I didn't...

479
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,462
I didn't know I bothered you.

480
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,555
AH-KEL:
<i>Get in there!</i>

481
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:22,224
He's going to kill us!

482
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:24,768
He says we were in with Croden.

483
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,562
Where is he, Quark?

484
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:29,106
Croden? He's in security.

485
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,316
You're lying!

486
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:31,484
(<i> gasping</i> )

487
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:33,068
He's gone!

488
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,570
You're hiding him.

489
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,572
You've been in this
together all along.

490
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:40,075
You're as responsible
for my brother's death as he is.

491
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,494
Ah-Kel, no.

492
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:43,036
This is Odo's doing.

493
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,704
Don't you see?

494
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:47,291
He wants to turn us
against each other.

495
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,501
Why should
I believe you?

496
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:51,211
Tell me
where Croden is

497
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,256
or you can die
in his place.

498
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,300
I don't know
where he is

499
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,843
but maybe
I could find out

500
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,928
if you'll
just release me.

501
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,847
(<i> gasping</i> )

502
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:09,438
Get me the security chips.

503
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,442
Level four clearance.

504
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,995
(<i> snapping fingers</i> )

505
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:42,471
It isn't at all clear...

506
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:52,356
The coordinates
are very clearly stated

507
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,525
right here in the log entry.

508
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,905
One more thing,
little Ferengi--

509
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,199
you better be telling me
the truth

510
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:04,284
or I'll be back...

511
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:06,995
to finish this.

512
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,340
Oh, you are clever,
brother.

513
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:23,011
Now Ah-Kel will rid us
of Croden<i> and</i> Odo.

514
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:27,307
Unless Odo is sensible,
and gives up his prisoner.

515
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,142
Oh, no!

516
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:33,689
Then Croden would tell Ah-Kel
the truth about our plan.

517
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:36,316
We're dead. We're dead.

518
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,026
You shouldn't have told
him how to find them.

519
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,279
Be quiet.

520
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:43,282
Odo will never give up
his prisoner.

521
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:45,867
He'll just
get himself killed.

522
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,661
Do you really think so?

523
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:51,164
Oh, get out of here,
you fool!

524
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,041
Get!

525
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:56,086
Yes, Chief?

526
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:58,380
The Miradorn ship
is leaving the station.

527
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,133
Major, do whatever
you can to delay them.

528
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,885
Ops to Miradorn ship...
please hold your position.

529
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,888
Stand by for
departure instructions.

530
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:07,973
No response.

531
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,516
They're still moving.

532
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,018
Dax, how long
before Odo reaches Rakhar?

533
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,396
Just over five hours.

534
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:16,189
KIRA:
Miradorn vessel...

535
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,734
you are in violation
of Bajoran transit regulations.

536
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:21,069
Please return<i> at once</i>
to the docking ring.

537
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,238
They've increased power
to their thrusters.

538
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,490
On screen.

539
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:43,300
You'd save time going
through the Vortex.

540
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,761
It's a long way
around it.

541
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:53,935
Aren't you the
least bit curious

542
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:57,272
about your
own people?

543
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,940
Of course, I am.

544
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,610
Unfortunately,
I don't have the liberty

545
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,070
of pursuing that curiosity
right now.

546
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,406
They don't maintain
a humanoid shape, you know.

547
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:10,369
They refused
to assimilate
on my world.

548
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,245
They're a proud species.

549
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:15,081
That's why
they were so persecuted.

550
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,459
But I will say this for them--

551
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,461
they treated me
well enough

552
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,880
when I landed
at their colony.

553
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,423
I was badly wounded.

554
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,425
They could have
allowed me to die.

555
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,552
They didn't.

556
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,178
You're one of them.

557
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,847
That's for sure.

558
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:33,433
You have the sense
of decency, of justice...

559
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,728
You don't give up, do you?

560
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:36,895
(<i> beeping</i> )

561
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,313
(<i> explosion</i> )

562
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,939
Computer, what was that?

563
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,941
COMPUTER:
A temporary loss of stability

564
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,778
resulting from the impact
of a concentrated plasma charge.

565
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,780
We're being attacked?

566
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,615
COMPUTER:
Affirmative.

567
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:52,411
Pursuing vessel approaching
from 181 mark 12.

568
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,580
Put it on the monitor
and identify.

569
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,082
COMPUTER:
Miradorn vessel, Theta class.

570
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,625
He's hailing us.

571
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,294
AH-KEL:
The first shot was a warning.

572
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:04,005
You will surrender
the Rakhari prisoner to me.

573
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:07,342
I don't give up my prisoners,
Ah-Kel.

574
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,302
Very well.

575
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,597
Then you can die with him.

576
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,809
(<i> explosion</i> )

577
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:18,228
COMPUTER:
Warning. Damage to shields.

578
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:20,773
Computer,
evasive maneuvers!

579
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:27,320
COMPUTER:
Warning. Shields at 41%.

580
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,572
Your computer's

581
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:30,240
not going to outsmart him.

582
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,117
I'm a security chief,
not a combat pilot!

583
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:33,159
Then give me the controls!

584
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,536
You?!

585
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:35,579
I can get us
through the Vortex.

586
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:36,996
The ionized gasses

587
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,040
would screen us
from his sensors.

588
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,753
Drop your suspicious nature
for a minute, changeling.

589
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:46,548
Can't you see?
It's our only chance!

590
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:47,674
(<i> grunts</i> )

591
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,822
Why are we
slowing down?

592
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:12,449
The Vortex is riddled
with volatile pockets

593
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:14,284
of a gas
we call<i> toh-maire.</i>

594
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:15,869
If we destabilize them

595
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:18,330
they could ignite,
and blow this ship apart.

596
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,794
You really have been
through here before.

597
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:26,421
Sometimes I do tell the truth.

598
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:30,049
How do you remember
what's true and what isn't?

599
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,844
(<i> explosion</i> )

600
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:34,053
I thought you said they couldn't
detect us in here.

601
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,389
He must be following
our impulse wake.

602
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:39,100
Computer,
disengage impulse engines.

603
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,560
Go to thrusters.

604
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,061
COMPUTER:
Acknowledged.

605
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,229
Thrusters engaged.

606
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,441
What are you doing?

607
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,276
Once our impulse wake drops off

608
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,237
he might try to pick up
the discharge of our thrusters.

609
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,072
We'll be better off if we land.

610
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:55,158
So, changeling

611
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,577
I guess I'm going
to take you home after all.

612
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:22,978
Hurry! This way!

613
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,437
ODO:
Croden!

614
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,857
Slow down, Croden!

615
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:29,026
Stay where I can see you.

616
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,612
Croden!

617
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:33,864
What's your hurry?

618
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:35,073
What's in here?

619
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,491
I told you--
the colony.

620
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,076
Anxious to see
them again, are you?

621
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,870
Yes. Of course.

622
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,204
Whatever it is you came
here for, you can forget it.

623
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,205
We're leaving.

624
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,582
No!
Now!

625
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,336
How much of it was true?
Any of it?

626
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,713
Any of it?!

627
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,381
No. No.

628
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:55,427
On Rakhar, we tell stories
about changelings.

629
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:59,347
I thought they were
myths until I met you.

630
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,807
The stone!

631
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,559
I have no idea
where it came from.

632
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,770
Rakhari merchants
buy stones just like it

633
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,271
from off-world traders.

634
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,564
It's used as a key.

635
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:08,941
A key to what?

636
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:10,984
To my only reason
for living.

637
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:14,071
And it's ahead,
in that cavern there.

638
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:31,088
Please, help me.

639
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:33,715
There's been a cave-in.

640
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,760
What is it?

641
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,887
A stasis chamber.

642
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:44,059
It's my daughter.

643
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,603
The only member
of my family I could save.

644
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:47,646
Help me.

645
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:59,825
It shapes itself
to fit the lock.

646
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,542
(<i> hissing</i> )

647
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,294
(<i> door opens</i> )

648
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,766
Father?

649
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,977
I was dreaming about you.

650
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:28,937
I'm here now, Yareth.

651
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:31,815
You don't have to dream anymore.

652
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,580
Hello.

653
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:53,419
This is Odo.

654
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,963
He's a security officer.

655
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:57,423
No, no, he's not
going to hurt you.

656
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,176
He's going to take you

657
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:01,511
to a place
where you'll be safe.

658
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:02,679
Won't you?

659
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,273
Where are<i> you</i> going?

660
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,068
I'm going home.

661
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:18,737
But you can't.
They'll kill you.

662
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:21,740
Yareth, I must answer
for my crimes.

663
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,118
But all you did was
try to protect us.

664
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:28,329
Their sensors must have
picked up our life signs.

665
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,916
We've got to get
back to the runabout.

666
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:36,046
Odo!

667
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:44,012
Is he badly hurt?

668
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,722
There's no way to tell.

669
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:48,391
I don't know anything
about his species.

670
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,185
I'll carry him
back to the ship.

671
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,317
What's the matter,
Father?

672
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:01,279
(<i> explosion</i> )

673
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:05,366
Nothing, darling.

674
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,910
Nothing.

675
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,037
Nothing.

676
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,872
Go! Go!

677
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:23,718
(<i> moaning</i> )

678
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,845
You're heavier
than you look.

679
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,853
You could have left me behind.

680
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,438
Don't thank me.

681
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:38,275
I already regret it.

682
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:40,693
I haven't been able
to lose them.

683
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,779
Sooner or later,
one of his photons

684
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,572
is going trigger
a<i> toh-maire</i> explosion

685
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:45,657
and kill us all.

686
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:53,748
Let me have the controls.

687
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,001
Find us one of those
<i>toh-maire</i> fields.

688
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:59,879
I just told you,
you don't want to go
anywhere near one changeling.

689
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,423
Find us
the closest<i> toh-maire</i> field.

690
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,678
Six degrees to starboard.

691
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,138
Changing course.

692
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:10,223
He's chased us everywhere else.

693
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:12,642
Maybe he'll follow us
in there, too.

694
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:14,060
His sensors may not be able

695
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,937
to detect
how volatile the field is.

696
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,772
If he fires on us in there,
the whole thing will ignite.

697
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,649
That's what I'm counting on.

698
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:28,658
Set a course
along the interior perimeter.

699
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:31,577
Done.

700
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,496
Computer, shut down all engines.

701
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,581
COMPUTER:
Engines disengaged.

702
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,292
Maintain emergency readiness

703
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,752
to reengage impulse
on my command.

704
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:42,588
We're an awfully easy target.

705
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,222
He's hailing us.

706
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:51,806
On screen.

707
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,684
Are you prepared
to surrender your prisoner?

708
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:58,437
I have a full array of Starfleet
weapons trained on you, Ah-Kel.

709
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,232
Frankly, I don't
know much about them

710
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:01,816
but I understand they
equipped this little vessel

711
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:02,817
with some
pretty powerful stuff

712
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,152
so I suggest

713
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:06,112
you withdraw
while you still can.

714
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:09,782
There will barely be a trace
of your little vessel

715
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,534
when we are finished with you.

716
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:17,623
He's coming about.

717
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,084
Powering
his shields.

718
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:22,337
His starboard photon bank
is armed.

719
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:25,423
Computer, engage!

720
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,011
He's firing photons.

721
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,891
(<i> alarm bleeping</i> )

722
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,986
Is everybody back there
in one piece?

723
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,654
Yes.

724
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,783
Good.

725
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,410
Take us out

726
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,536
of your precious Vortex.

727
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,928
I only have one
last favor to ask.

728
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:15,098
Yareth is going to be
alone on your world

729
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:18,101
just as you've
always been.

730
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,937
She's going
to need someone
to look after her.

731
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:29,779
If you're asking me
what I think you're asking...

732
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:32,365
We know you could use
some company, changeling.

733
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:35,243
You'll deny it, but we
both know it's true

734
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,412
or this stone would have
meant nothing to you.

735
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:39,538
COMPUTER:
Incoming subspace signal.

736
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:42,583
Vulcan band frequency.

737
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,337
On screen.

738
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:47,046
Starfleet Runabout

739
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,965
this is the Vulcan Science
Vessel<i> T'Vran.</i>

740
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:50,633
Are you in any difficulty?

741
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:52,760
Chief of Security Odo
from DS9.

742
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,595
We're fine, Captain.

743
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,223
We detected a major eruption
in the Chamra Vortex.

744
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,725
I was afraid a small ship
like yours

745
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,519
might have suffered damage.

746
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,271
I appreciate your concern.

747
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:04,897
What's your course?

748
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:08,067
To the wormhole,
then home to Vulcan.

749
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,696
I've beamed over two survivors

750
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,948
from a ship
that wasn't so lucky.

751
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,117
I have to complete a mission.

752
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:19,329
Could you give them
transportation to Vulcan?

753
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:20,872
Easily done.

754
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,541
We will rendezvous
with you shortly.

755
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,335
Prepare for transport.

756
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,382
Don't thank me.

757
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:31,883
I already regret it.

758
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:36,637
How?

759
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:39,182
How will you explain
not delivering me?

760
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:44,229
I'll tell them you were killed

761
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:46,814
when Ah-Kel torpedoed
the asteroid.

762
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:50,235
This dissembling
must be catching.

763
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:52,987
You're going to have
to get used to living

764
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,489
in an alien society.

765
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:55,781
Like you...

766
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:57,616
but I know
where my home is

767
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,951
and perhaps, someday

768
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:01,079
I'll be able
to go back again.

769
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:08,002
I hope this helps you to
find where you came from.

770
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:18,346
VULCAN CAPTAIN:
<i>T'Vran</i> to<i> Ganges.</i>

771
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:19,556
Ready for transport.

772
00:43:19,556 --> 00:43:20,806
Stand by.

773
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,683
Are you really a changeling?

774
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:26,145
Yes...

775
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,064
I suppose I am.

776
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:35,405
Go on.

777
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:37,823
We don't want to keep
the Vulcans waiting.

778
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,205
Energizing.

779
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,887
Computer, set a course
for the wormhole.

780
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,847
Course laid in.

781
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,724
Ready engines.

782
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:07,645
Home.

783
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,856
Where is it?

784
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:19,907
Someday we'll know...

785
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,659
cousin.

786
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,581
Engage.
