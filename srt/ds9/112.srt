1
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,171
The usual, Odo?

2
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:12,339
Nothing.

3
00:00:12,381 --> 00:00:13,679
The usual.

4
00:00:13,716 --> 00:00:15,811
If all my customers
were like you

5
00:00:15,854 --> 00:00:18,689
my family would be begging
in the Promenade.

6
00:00:18,725 --> 00:00:20,455
Oh, I seriously doubt that...

7
00:00:20,495 --> 00:00:23,193
not as long as there
is a Miradorn raider

8
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:25,203
for you to do business with.

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,765
Raider? You mean the Miradorn
ship that just docked?

10
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:29,869
The raider.

11
00:00:29,912 --> 00:00:32,041
Its reputation, like mine

12
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:34,451
has probably been exaggerated.

13
00:00:34,487 --> 00:00:37,891
Anyway, I don't know
the ship or its crew.

14
00:00:37,926 --> 00:00:40,453
You didn't make
your usual welcome call

15
00:00:40,497 --> 00:00:42,729
inviting them in
for a free drink?

16
00:00:42,768 --> 00:00:45,500
The Miradorns are
a quarrelsome people.

17
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,238
I chose to forego
the usual amenities.

18
00:00:48,279 --> 00:00:51,581
He looks away whenever
we make eye contact.

19
00:00:51,617 --> 00:00:52,812
Who?

20
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:54,151
The new arrival...

21
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:56,421
the one the Klingons
brought back

22
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,985
from the Gamma Quadrant.

23
00:00:58,029 --> 00:00:59,725
Croden? He's harmless.

24
00:00:59,766 --> 00:01:03,728
Really? How is it you've
come to know him so well?

25
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:07,212
A man comes in for a drink,
he wants to talk.

26
00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:09,875
He didn't seem to want
to talk much to Sisko

27
00:01:09,917 --> 00:01:10,907
when he arrived.

28
00:01:10,953 --> 00:01:12,182
Who would?

29
00:01:12,222 --> 00:01:14,715
All those Starfleet officers
greeting him at the airlock...

30
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,750
it would scare me, too.

31
00:01:15,795 --> 00:01:18,095
The Federation could
learn a few things

32
00:01:18,132 --> 00:01:20,193
from the Ferengi
about hospitality.

33
00:01:20,236 --> 00:01:22,900
They scared him, huh?

34
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,238
Of course.

35
00:01:24,276 --> 00:01:26,872
I wonder what he has
to be scared about.

36
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:44,606
Well, now.

37
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:47,847
I believe a pair
of twinned Miradorn

38
00:01:47,885 --> 00:01:49,751
just nodded your way.

39
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:54,457
I'm the man behind the bar.

40
00:01:54,498 --> 00:01:58,130
Obviously, they want
to use a holosuite.

41
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,907
You think the whole galaxy is
plotting around you, don't you?

42
00:02:02,946 --> 00:02:05,576
Paranoia must run
in your species, Odo.

43
00:02:05,617 --> 00:02:08,144
Maybe that's why
no one has ever seen

44
00:02:08,188 --> 00:02:09,747
another shape-shifter...

45
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,260
they're all hiding!

46
00:02:11,361 --> 00:02:15,095
I won't have you coming here
harassing my customers.

47
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:17,798
Order a drink, play the tables

48
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:20,639
or vacate the premises!

49
00:02:22,815 --> 00:02:26,310
Rom, bring a flask
of my special langour.

50
00:04:58,024 --> 00:05:01,758
1,000 bars of
gold-pressed latinum.

51
00:05:01,797 --> 00:05:03,459
Nonnegotiable.

52
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:09,971
Ahh.

53
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:17,052
Oh, very nice.

54
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:20,552
Unfortunately, uh,
there's a problem.

55
00:05:20,598 --> 00:05:22,066
Problem?

56
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,068
Langour, anyone?

57
00:05:23,102 --> 00:05:24,070
What problem?

58
00:05:24,104 --> 00:05:25,732
The buyer has backed out.

59
00:05:25,773 --> 00:05:27,503
You guaranteed us a buyer.

60
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:29,639
A question has been raised

61
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:31,947
about the origin of this bauble.

62
00:05:31,985 --> 00:05:34,615
A similar one was taken
during a raid

63
00:05:34,657 --> 00:05:38,596
on a Vanoben transport
just two light-years from here.

64
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:40,601
If you had a bill of sale...

65
00:05:40,634 --> 00:05:43,970
You didn't ask
for any bill of sale

66
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:45,635
when we contacted you.

67
00:05:45,676 --> 00:05:48,112
You will find another buyer.

68
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,640
A buyer who asks no questions?

69
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:53,019
That could take a long time.

70
00:05:53,056 --> 00:05:55,618
We don't have a long time.

71
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:59,100
Just stay, stay,
stay where you are, please.

72
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:01,398
What's this?

73
00:06:01,438 --> 00:06:02,736
Don't fire!

74
00:06:02,774 --> 00:06:04,710
What do you want?

75
00:06:04,744 --> 00:06:06,714
No one is going to get hurt.

76
00:06:06,747 --> 00:06:08,579
Just... just give me that.

77
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:12,022
Whoever you are,
you're making a mistake.

78
00:06:12,057 --> 00:06:13,753
Well, it wouldn't be the first

79
00:06:13,794 --> 00:06:15,490
and probably won't be the last.

80
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,520
Give that to me.

81
00:06:39,373 --> 00:06:41,366
Security and medical
to Holosuite One.

82
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,746
Five glasses for four people?

83
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,648
He's dead.

84
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,318
My brother.

85
00:06:59,042 --> 00:07:01,945
Take them all to security.

86
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,951
Yes, take them both
to his office.

87
00:07:04,986 --> 00:07:07,479
Thank goodness
you were close by, Odo.

88
00:07:07,524 --> 00:07:08,492
All of them.

89
00:07:08,526 --> 00:07:09,892
Get out. Go on.

90
00:07:27,493 --> 00:07:30,589
Have you known
any twinned Miradorn, Commander?

91
00:07:30,631 --> 00:07:32,395
I haven't met any before now.

92
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:36,067
In my species,
we are not just twin brothers.

93
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:38,170
Together, we are
a single self...

94
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:43,011
two halves of one being.

95
00:07:43,054 --> 00:07:44,818
I am incomplete now.

96
00:07:44,858 --> 00:07:46,953
You should have
considered the risks

97
00:07:46,994 --> 00:07:49,226
before trying
to sell stolen property.

98
00:07:49,265 --> 00:07:50,324
You have no proof.

99
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:51,665
Two people were killed
on the transport

100
00:07:51,703 --> 00:07:53,001
this object was taken from.

101
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:55,668
My brother and I purchased it
from a passing Altairian trader.

102
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,008
His name?
His ship's identification?

103
00:07:57,045 --> 00:07:58,911
I am the one whose brother
was killed, Commander!

104
00:07:58,949 --> 00:07:59,939
You have only yourself...

105
00:07:59,985 --> 00:08:02,581
I'd like for you to return
to your ship now!

106
00:08:03,892 --> 00:08:05,360
You have my sympathies

107
00:08:05,394 --> 00:08:07,489
but there may be more questions.

108
00:08:07,532 --> 00:08:09,661
Please don't leave the station.

109
00:08:09,701 --> 00:08:13,333
I want to deal with the one
who killed my twin.

110
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,709
The law will deal with him.

111
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:27,028
My only purpose
in life from here on

112
00:08:27,066 --> 00:08:30,561
is to see him dead.

113
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:35,911
Well...

114
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:40,286
can't say I didn't warn
you about Miradorns, Odo.

115
00:08:40,324 --> 00:08:42,692
I assume we are free to go?

116
00:08:42,728 --> 00:08:45,460
Do you have enough evidence
to hold them, Constable?

117
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,130
As Odo will be happy to confirm

118
00:08:48,171 --> 00:08:51,666
I was just as concerned
as everyone else

119
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,739
that this was
a stolen objet d'art.

120
00:08:54,782 --> 00:08:58,448
Yes. Curious, but it's true.

121
00:09:00,126 --> 00:09:02,528
We'll be on our way then.

122
00:09:02,564 --> 00:09:04,932
You know what else is curious?

123
00:09:04,968 --> 00:09:09,568
It's curious that Croden
had a Ferengi phaser.

124
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:14,050
Available in many a port.

125
00:09:14,084 --> 00:09:16,577
And it's curious that he knew

126
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:19,788
the Miradorn were
trying to sell you

127
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:21,889
something of value.

128
00:09:21,932 --> 00:09:24,698
How dare you suggest
that my brother

129
00:09:24,736 --> 00:09:26,329
set up this robbery!

130
00:09:26,373 --> 00:09:29,743
What an interesting theory, Rom.

131
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:33,309
If that theory should
ever reach the Miradorn

132
00:09:33,352 --> 00:09:35,618
I'd wake up dead one morning.

133
00:09:35,656 --> 00:09:37,386
So, I'd appreciate

134
00:09:37,427 --> 00:09:42,130
your not spreading wild
theories about casually.

135
00:09:46,576 --> 00:09:49,376
Lobeless idiot, next time...

136
00:09:58,163 --> 00:10:00,292
Don't you feed your prisoners?

137
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:02,531
The fact that you
just killed a man

138
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,541
doesn't affect your appetite?

139
00:10:04,575 --> 00:10:06,545
It was him or me.

140
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:09,482
And if he had killed me,
I wouldn't be hungry now.

141
00:10:09,517 --> 00:10:10,917
I want you to understand

142
00:10:10,953 --> 00:10:12,717
exactly what's going to happen.

143
00:10:12,757 --> 00:10:13,952
There will be a trial

144
00:10:13,992 --> 00:10:16,121
to determine
your guilt or innocence.

145
00:10:16,163 --> 00:10:17,563
We can assign an advocate

146
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:20,228
or you can request one
from your home world.

147
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:23,572
I doubt if anyone on Rakhar
would much care.

148
00:10:23,643 --> 00:10:24,770
Really?

149
00:10:24,811 --> 00:10:27,304
Isn't murder considered
a serious crime

150
00:10:27,349 --> 00:10:28,578
where you come from?

151
00:10:28,686 --> 00:10:31,179
On Rakhar,
all crimes are serious...

152
00:10:31,223 --> 00:10:33,089
only there are no trials.

153
00:10:33,126 --> 00:10:35,187
It's a shame that our first
encounter with your species

154
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,030
had to take place
under such circumstances.

155
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:40,369
I'm sorry if I made
things awkward.

156
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,968
I didn't have much choice.

157
00:10:43,011 --> 00:10:44,036
Why not?

158
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,044
My needs exceed my skills.

159
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:52,528
Now, if I had his talents

160
00:10:52,562 --> 00:10:54,794
I would have no problems at all.

161
00:10:54,832 --> 00:10:56,630
I've never heard of a changeling

162
00:10:56,736 --> 00:10:58,638
with such versatility.

163
00:10:58,706 --> 00:10:59,639
A what?!

164
00:10:59,707 --> 00:11:02,576
A changeling, like you.

165
00:11:05,384 --> 00:11:08,082
You've heard
of other shape-shifters

166
00:11:08,123 --> 00:11:09,955
in the Gamma Quadrant?

167
00:11:09,993 --> 00:11:12,259
Haven't they come
through the wormhole yet?

168
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,594
I assumed, when I saw you...

169
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:14,600
It's a lie.

170
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:16,968
He heard me talking
in the bar to Quark.

171
00:11:17,005 --> 00:11:20,307
Well, maybe I dissemble
a little.

172
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:22,474
"Lie" is a hard word.

173
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,280
But shape-shifters

174
00:11:24,318 --> 00:11:26,220
are harsh in their judgments.

175
00:11:26,256 --> 00:11:29,056
Feed me

176
00:11:29,094 --> 00:11:33,728
and maybe I'll tell you
where I met someone

177
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:36,103
just like you.

178
00:11:44,935 --> 00:11:46,460
I don't see
that we have any choice.

179
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:47,837
We have to contact his planet.

180
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,470
Not the best way
of introducing ourselves.

181
00:11:50,512 --> 00:11:52,812
Homicide as a means
to open relations...

182
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,047
it's not exactly how they
teach it at the Academy, is it?

183
00:11:55,088 --> 00:11:56,556
I think you're all wrong.

184
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,888
How's that?

185
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,224
They're going to thank us.

186
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:00,559
Thank us?

187
00:12:00,597 --> 00:12:01,826
Oh, that's what I'd do.

188
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:04,029
He's probably committed
all sorts of crimes

189
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,299
in their system.

190
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:08,139
They'll be glad to have the
problem taken off their hands.

191
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:09,975
There's only one way
to find out. Dax?

192
00:12:10,015 --> 00:12:12,110
It won't be hard to find Rakhar.

193
00:12:12,151 --> 00:12:13,449
According to the logs

194
00:12:13,487 --> 00:12:15,787
Croden was found
in a damaged shuttlecraft

195
00:12:15,824 --> 00:12:18,124
about three light-years
from the wormhole.

196
00:12:18,162 --> 00:12:21,931
There aren't many
M-Class planets in that area.

197
00:12:21,969 --> 00:12:23,130
You're with me.

198
00:12:23,171 --> 00:12:25,368
Major Kira, as long
as the Miradorn ship is here

199
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:26,672
there's a threat to Croden.

200
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:28,509
I don't want to have
to tell his people

201
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,710
that he was killed
while in our custody.

202
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:33,244
I'll have Odo increase security.

203
00:12:47,481 --> 00:12:50,281
Stop in to see if I'd run away?

204
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:52,723
I couldn't get that lucky.

205
00:12:55,196 --> 00:12:59,728
That Croden
is an interesting character.

206
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,204
I wouldn't know.

207
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,673
Really?

208
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:05,875
I thought you said
you got to know him rather well.

209
00:13:05,914 --> 00:13:08,146
I never told you that.

210
00:13:08,185 --> 00:13:11,715
I merely said we chatted
when he bought a drink or two.

211
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:15,390
I've talked to several people
who saw the two of you

212
00:13:15,432 --> 00:13:16,798
engaged in heavy conversations.

213
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:20,238
Why, Morn, here, says you even
bought the fellow a meal.

214
00:13:20,274 --> 00:13:23,872
Morn should keep
his big mouth shut.

215
00:13:28,622 --> 00:13:31,593
So what were you
talking to him about?

216
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:34,564
Just being friendly.

217
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:37,229
He was...

218
00:13:37,271 --> 00:13:39,798
so out of place here... alone.

219
00:13:39,842 --> 00:13:42,973
I felt sorry for him.

220
00:13:43,015 --> 00:13:46,852
You should sympathize
with my kindness.

221
00:13:46,888 --> 00:13:49,051
There's no profit in kindness.

222
00:13:49,092 --> 00:13:52,531
You attribute odious motives
to my every charitable act.

223
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:55,936
That's because your favorite
charity is your own pocket.

224
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,806
Speaking of odious motives

225
00:13:58,843 --> 00:14:01,245
I hear you've
been making inquiries

226
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,682
about finding a small ship
to go through the wormhole.

227
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,813
That has nothing to do
with any of this.

228
00:14:05,855 --> 00:14:06,823
I think it does.

229
00:14:06,857 --> 00:14:08,850
I think you were trying
to secure passage

230
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,693
back to the Gamma Quadrant
for Croden

231
00:14:10,731 --> 00:14:13,725
in exchange for staging this
tragic little robbery of yours.

232
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:17,208
This could turn into
a much bigger tragedy for me

233
00:14:17,243 --> 00:14:19,509
if you don't
keep your voice down.

234
00:14:19,547 --> 00:14:22,017
What did Croden
tell you about himself?

235
00:14:22,051 --> 00:14:23,417
Nothing.

236
00:14:23,454 --> 00:14:26,220
We didn't talk about
anything except business.

237
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:27,625
Inconsequential things.

238
00:14:27,695 --> 00:14:30,757
What's inconsequential to
you may be important to me.

239
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,827
Did he say anything
about his home world?

240
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:34,567
No.

241
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,907
Other species in
the Gamma Quadrant?

242
00:14:36,945 --> 00:14:38,743
No.

243
00:14:38,781 --> 00:14:40,249
Security to Odo.

244
00:14:40,285 --> 00:14:41,776
Go ahead.

245
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,848
Ah-Kel and his crew are blocking
the entrance to your office.

246
00:14:44,892 --> 00:14:46,155
Should we clear them out?

247
00:14:46,194 --> 00:14:47,594
Leave it. I'll handle them.

248
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:57,814
You were told
to stay on your ship.

249
00:14:57,849 --> 00:14:59,545
Understand me, shape-shifter.

250
00:14:59,585 --> 00:15:04,151
He killed the part of me
that made existence bearable.

251
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:07,792
I cannot stop until I kill him.

252
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:09,895
You're not going to kill anyone.

253
00:15:09,937 --> 00:15:11,565
Get back to your ship
and stay there.

254
00:15:11,607 --> 00:15:13,873
If I find you here again,
I'll lock you up, too.

255
00:15:34,882 --> 00:15:40,290
You've made a lot of friends
in your short stay here.

256
00:15:40,326 --> 00:15:42,888
Well, I guess you'd
know how that feels.

257
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:46,300
You and I have a great deal
in common, changeling.

258
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:48,363
We have nothing in common.

259
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:50,309
We are both aliens here...

260
00:15:50,344 --> 00:15:52,940
the only ones of our kind.

261
00:15:52,982 --> 00:15:55,179
Each of us is alone

262
00:15:55,219 --> 00:15:56,983
isolated, shut out.

263
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:59,015
Others like us

264
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:01,461
only exist
in the Gamma Quadrant.

265
00:16:02,966 --> 00:16:04,832
I have always wondered

266
00:16:04,869 --> 00:16:09,640
why changelings are so
distrustful of other species.

267
00:16:11,114 --> 00:16:14,142
I doubt the changelings
on your world

268
00:16:14,187 --> 00:16:16,053
would trust you.

269
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:17,489
Of course not.

270
00:16:17,525 --> 00:16:19,961
There are no shape-shifters
on Rakhar.

271
00:16:19,996 --> 00:16:21,396
You just said...

272
00:16:23,503 --> 00:16:26,133
You implied there were.

273
00:16:26,174 --> 00:16:28,576
I'm sorry if I misled you.

274
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,674
There were shape-shifters
on Rakhar at one time

275
00:16:31,718 --> 00:16:33,550
but that was centuries ago.

276
00:16:33,588 --> 00:16:35,056
What happened to them?

277
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,890
They were persecuted.

278
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:39,591
Driven out.

279
00:16:45,108 --> 00:16:47,908
But I know a place
where there are still some left.

280
00:16:47,947 --> 00:16:50,747
Of course,
that was a few years ago.

281
00:16:50,785 --> 00:16:52,185
And if you had the chance

282
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:53,883
you'd take me there.

283
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:56,362
Sure, I would.

284
00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:57,590
Why not?

285
00:16:57,631 --> 00:16:59,624
Tell me where it is,
I'll have a look.

286
00:16:59,668 --> 00:17:02,434
Ah... No, I...

287
00:17:02,473 --> 00:17:04,339
I have to show you.

288
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:07,041
There is no way that you could
find it on your own.

289
00:17:07,081 --> 00:17:09,711
The next time you lie

290
00:17:09,786 --> 00:17:12,723
I'll save Ah-Kel
the trouble of killing you.

291
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:14,887
There's that hard word again.

292
00:17:17,033 --> 00:17:20,335
There are times
when I don't dissemble.

293
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,433
Whatever you call it

294
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,536
the truth isn't in you.

295
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,389
From the colony
of the changelings.

296
00:18:14,905 --> 00:18:17,432
We're in orbit.

297
00:18:17,476 --> 00:18:19,206
Open hailing frequency.

298
00:18:19,246 --> 00:18:20,714
Open.

299
00:18:20,749 --> 00:18:23,413
This is the Federation Starship
<i>Rio Grande</i>

300
00:18:23,453 --> 00:18:26,549
attempting to make contact
with the planet Rakhar.

301
00:18:26,593 --> 00:18:27,754
Please respond.

302
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,005
One of your people
committed a homicide

303
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,805
and we have him in custody.

304
00:18:36,844 --> 00:18:38,335
His name is Croden.

305
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:42,376
I'm picking up a signal
in the southern hemisphere.

306
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,946
They're hailing us.

307
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,424
On screen.

308
00:18:46,562 --> 00:18:48,998
I am the Exarch
of Nehelik Province.

309
00:18:49,033 --> 00:18:51,970
You will transport Croden
to this location.

310
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,907
I'm afraid we haven't
brought him with us.

311
00:18:53,941 --> 00:18:55,500
Your communication
clearly stated

312
00:18:55,611 --> 00:18:57,045
that he was in your custody.

313
00:18:57,081 --> 00:18:58,379
On our space station.

314
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:01,114
Perhaps I should explain
where we come from.

315
00:19:01,154 --> 00:19:03,056
We are well aware of the traffic

316
00:19:03,092 --> 00:19:04,651
through the newly discovered
passage.

317
00:19:04,694 --> 00:19:05,821
We simply have no interest

318
00:19:05,863 --> 00:19:07,661
in contact with anyone
from your Quadrant.

319
00:19:07,699 --> 00:19:09,224
I am sorry to hear that

320
00:19:09,269 --> 00:19:12,035
but we certainly will
respect your wishes.

321
00:19:12,074 --> 00:19:15,843
We just felt it was necessary
after Croden was arrested.

322
00:19:15,881 --> 00:19:17,783
Croden is an enemy
of the Rakhari people!

323
00:19:17,818 --> 00:19:20,380
We request that
he be returned immediately.

324
00:19:20,423 --> 00:19:22,916
He's scheduled to be tried
for his crime on our station.

325
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:26,730
Tried? Croden has already been
declared guilty in absentia

326
00:19:26,768 --> 00:19:28,863
for myriad crimes on this world.

327
00:19:28,904 --> 00:19:31,431
That judgment supersedes
your charges.

328
00:19:31,475 --> 00:19:35,073
Return him, and I can assure you
his punishment will be

329
00:19:35,115 --> 00:19:37,415
appropriate to your crime
as well as ours.

330
00:19:37,453 --> 00:19:39,149
I would feel more comfortable
if we could find...

331
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,524
I do not know what kind
of people you are...

332
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,622
I do not care to know...
but if your society purports

333
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,761
to respect the rules
of our society

334
00:19:46,804 --> 00:19:48,865
you will return him
without delay.

335
00:19:52,948 --> 00:19:57,548
Expect him to return
in a vessel just like this one

336
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:59,181
within 52 hours.

337
00:20:12,816 --> 00:20:14,877
It's an amalgam
of organic material

338
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,684
and some sort of crystal.

339
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,757
You mean... it's alive.

340
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:22,027
More or less.

341
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:24,367
It's almost like
a transitional phase

342
00:20:24,404 --> 00:20:26,738
between organic
and inorganic matter.

343
00:20:26,775 --> 00:20:30,714
I've only seen one life-form
that even remotely resembles it.

344
00:20:30,749 --> 00:20:32,115
Me.

345
00:20:32,152 --> 00:20:34,987
In a way...

346
00:20:35,023 --> 00:20:39,760
this stone might qualify
as a distant cousin of yours.

347
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:41,825
Maybe there's a clue
to your origins here.

348
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:43,132
Where did it come from?

349
00:20:43,172 --> 00:20:47,738
Unfortunately,
the only one who can tell me

350
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,272
is less reliable than Quark.

351
00:21:07,148 --> 00:21:09,311
How do you like
my stone, changeling?

352
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:10,377
Where'd you get it?

353
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:13,621
What would telling you get me?

354
00:21:13,693 --> 00:21:15,025
Nothing.

355
00:21:15,062 --> 00:21:16,724
Ah.

356
00:21:16,765 --> 00:21:18,063
Well, that's too bad.

357
00:21:18,101 --> 00:21:20,298
I was hoping
you'd feel sorry for me

358
00:21:20,338 --> 00:21:22,331
seeing as we're
the only two here

359
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,504
from the other side
of the passage.

360
00:21:24,546 --> 00:21:26,743
I feel nothing
for you but contempt.

361
00:21:26,783 --> 00:21:30,313
You're a thief and a killer,
and who knows what else.

362
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,086
Typical. It's typical.

363
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:34,028
Of "changeling behavior"?

364
00:21:34,062 --> 00:21:35,360
Yes, I'm sure.

365
00:21:35,398 --> 00:21:36,832
Uh, excuse me.

366
00:21:49,257 --> 00:21:51,284
In my sector

367
00:21:51,327 --> 00:21:53,193
there is a nebula
called the Chamra Vortex.

368
00:21:53,231 --> 00:21:55,895
There are millions
of asteroids in it.

369
00:21:55,935 --> 00:21:58,497
I found this stone
on one of them.

370
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,204
I could take you to it,
changeling.

371
00:22:01,245 --> 00:22:03,408
Others must know where it is.

372
00:22:03,449 --> 00:22:06,751
No, no, the Vortex is uncharted
but, as a thief

373
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:10,592
and a killer and who knows what,
I hid there often.

374
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,965
I found this colony
of changelings by chance

375
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:15,799
and I know my way back.

376
00:22:23,966 --> 00:22:25,628
Come in.

377
00:22:28,475 --> 00:22:29,670
Yes, Commander?

378
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,806
Constable, I want you
to escort the prisoner

379
00:22:32,849 --> 00:22:34,613
back to his home planet.

380
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:40,853
He's... not to stand trial...
here?

381
00:22:40,897 --> 00:22:43,697
Croden apparently
committed crimes on Rakhar.

382
00:22:43,735 --> 00:22:44,862
His government is adamant

383
00:22:44,904 --> 00:22:46,897
and the Bajorans have agreed
to release him.

384
00:22:46,942 --> 00:22:51,109
We're going to have trouble
getting him past the Miradorn.

385
00:22:51,149 --> 00:22:52,378
Yes, I know.

386
00:22:52,418 --> 00:22:53,784
Ah-Kel's been
screening every ship

387
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,810
leaving this station.

388
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:59,730
How soon can you be ready?

389
00:22:59,764 --> 00:23:01,323
I'm ready now.

390
00:23:01,367 --> 00:23:02,665
There's a Rigelian freighter

391
00:23:02,703 --> 00:23:04,900
leaving here for the Gamma
Quadrant in an hour.

392
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,910
Maybe we can use them
to run interference

393
00:23:06,944 --> 00:23:08,640
between you
and the Miradorn ship.

394
00:23:09,782 --> 00:23:12,651
I'll move the prisoner
to the runabout right away.

395
00:23:12,687 --> 00:23:15,249
Constable, once you're
on the other side

396
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:16,760
you'll be on your own.

397
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:20,131
The Miradorn vessel can
outrun any of our runabouts

398
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:21,999
and, if they do come after you

399
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:25,169
a warning from us will
just point an arrow to you.

400
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,701
Understood.

401
00:23:47,483 --> 00:23:50,045
So you're finally
taking me up on my offer.

402
00:23:50,088 --> 00:23:52,991
I'm taking you home.

403
00:23:57,368 --> 00:23:58,893
Commander.

404
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:04,369
The Rigelian freighter's
ready for departure.

405
00:24:04,414 --> 00:24:05,609
Signal Odo.

406
00:24:17,738 --> 00:24:21,837
The Miradorn ship
is scanning the freighter.

407
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:25,818
Doesn't look like
they're reading the runabout.

408
00:24:42,783 --> 00:24:45,686
How do you stand it, changeling?

409
00:24:45,722 --> 00:24:48,454
Living where you don't belong?

410
00:24:52,634 --> 00:24:55,765
Are you happy?

411
00:24:55,807 --> 00:24:59,109
I'm as much a part
of the place as anyone else.

412
00:24:59,145 --> 00:25:00,374
Oh, I doubt it.

413
00:25:00,414 --> 00:25:03,044
They tolerate you,
but you're not one of them.

414
00:25:03,087 --> 00:25:04,419
Being what you are

415
00:25:04,456 --> 00:25:07,427
you can pour your square shape
into a round hole

416
00:25:07,461 --> 00:25:09,020
but you don't really fit,
do you?

417
00:25:09,063 --> 00:25:10,361
You're like my stone.

418
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:11,731
I think I finally figured out

419
00:25:11,768 --> 00:25:14,398
what crime you were
found guilty of on your world.

420
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,430
What's that?

421
00:25:15,475 --> 00:25:16,841
You talk too much.

422
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:21,716
Maybe you're right.

423
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:24,383
Perhaps that is how it started.

424
00:25:24,425 --> 00:25:28,728
Perhaps I asked
one question too many.

425
00:25:28,766 --> 00:25:32,136
Anyway, that's as good
an explanation as any.

426
00:25:32,172 --> 00:25:34,642
Explanation for what?

427
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:38,772
For why they came that night.

428
00:25:40,788 --> 00:25:44,420
I was never told, and,
to this day, I don't know.

429
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:46,624
They broke into my home
just before dawn

430
00:25:46,664 --> 00:25:48,566
and, before I had time
to stop them

431
00:25:48,601 --> 00:25:50,399
they had murdered both my wives.

432
00:25:52,975 --> 00:25:54,603
You see...

433
00:25:54,646 --> 00:25:55,909
on my world

434
00:25:55,948 --> 00:25:59,216
the punishment for being
an enemy of the people

435
00:25:59,253 --> 00:26:01,280
is the death of your family.

436
00:26:01,324 --> 00:26:04,227
I had no
sophisticated weapon...

437
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:06,732
only a short slaughter knife

438
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:10,228
that I used for cutting
the necks of fowl

439
00:26:10,273 --> 00:26:12,743
that we would
prepare for supper.

440
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:15,749
Imagine my surprise
when I discovered

441
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:18,755
that the necks
of the security officers

442
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:22,751
were no more difficult
to cut than the birds'.

443
00:26:22,796 --> 00:26:24,766
Even the sound they made

444
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,298
as the blade crossed
their gullets were similar.

445
00:26:31,311 --> 00:26:34,772
You expect me
to believe this appalling tale?

446
00:26:34,818 --> 00:26:37,789
Would it make any difference
if you did?

447
00:26:37,823 --> 00:26:38,984
No.

448
00:26:40,829 --> 00:26:45,702
Well, then believe it,
because it's true.

449
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:49,142
Oh, my return
will be celebrated, changeling.

450
00:26:49,176 --> 00:26:50,474
They'll be very grateful.

451
00:26:50,512 --> 00:26:51,775
You'll be a hero.

452
00:26:51,814 --> 00:26:53,807
Perhaps
you might even use this

453
00:26:53,852 --> 00:26:55,981
as an excuse
to exchange envoys.

454
00:26:56,023 --> 00:26:57,321
If you don't stop talking

455
00:26:57,358 --> 00:26:59,658
I could sedate you
for the rest of the trip.

456
00:27:02,134 --> 00:27:03,762
Sorry. I didn't...

457
00:27:03,803 --> 00:27:05,773
I didn't know I bothered you.

458
00:27:15,992 --> 00:27:16,982
Get in there!

459
00:27:17,027 --> 00:27:18,461
He's going to kill us!

460
00:27:18,496 --> 00:27:21,126
He says we were in with Croden.

461
00:27:21,168 --> 00:27:22,932
Where is he, Quark?

462
00:27:22,971 --> 00:27:24,735
Croden? He's in security.

463
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:26,502
You're lying!

464
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,307
He's gone!

465
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:30,476
You're hiding him.

466
00:27:30,517 --> 00:27:32,987
You've been in this
together all along.

467
00:27:33,022 --> 00:27:36,324
You're as responsible
for my brother's death as he is.

468
00:27:36,362 --> 00:27:37,660
Ah-Kel, no.

469
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,325
This is Odo's doing.

470
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:40,835
Don't you see?

471
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,500
He wants to turn us
against each other.

472
00:27:43,541 --> 00:27:44,702
Why should I believe you?

473
00:27:44,744 --> 00:27:47,374
Tell me where Croden is

474
00:27:47,482 --> 00:27:50,510
or you can die in his place.

475
00:27:50,553 --> 00:27:52,523
I don't know where he is

476
00:27:52,557 --> 00:27:54,185
but maybe I could find out

477
00:27:54,227 --> 00:27:56,220
if you'll just release me.

478
00:28:03,176 --> 00:28:05,806
Get me the security chips.

479
00:28:07,618 --> 00:28:09,850
Level four clearance.

480
00:28:35,902 --> 00:28:38,805
It isn't at all clear...

481
00:28:46,087 --> 00:28:48,649
The coordinates
are very clearly stated

482
00:28:48,692 --> 00:28:50,924
right here in the log entry.

483
00:28:53,601 --> 00:28:56,333
One more thing, little Ferengi...

484
00:28:56,372 --> 00:28:58,569
you better be telling me
the truth

485
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,603
or I'll be back...

486
00:29:01,882 --> 00:29:03,373
to finish this.

487
00:29:11,566 --> 00:29:14,868
Oh, you are clever, brother.

488
00:29:14,906 --> 00:29:19,404
Now Ah-Kel will rid us
of Croden and Odo.

489
00:29:19,513 --> 00:29:23,646
Unless Odo is sensible,
and gives up his prisoner.

490
00:29:23,688 --> 00:29:25,213
Oh, no!

491
00:29:25,257 --> 00:29:30,221
Then Croden would tell Ah-Kel
the truth about our plan.

492
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:32,896
We're dead. We're dead.

493
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,429
You shouldn't have told
him how to find them.

494
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:36,773
Be quiet.

495
00:29:36,811 --> 00:29:39,782
Odo will never give up
his prisoner.

496
00:29:39,817 --> 00:29:42,310
He'll just get himself killed.

497
00:29:42,355 --> 00:29:44,221
Do you really think so?

498
00:29:44,258 --> 00:29:47,594
Oh, get out of here, you fool!

499
00:29:47,631 --> 00:29:49,497
Get!

500
00:29:50,971 --> 00:29:52,599
Yes, Chief?

501
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,769
The Miradorn ship
is leaving the station.

502
00:29:54,811 --> 00:29:57,611
Major, do whatever
you can to delay them.

503
00:29:57,649 --> 00:30:00,449
Ops to Miradorn ship...
please hold your position.

504
00:30:00,487 --> 00:30:03,356
Stand by for
departure instructions.

505
00:30:03,393 --> 00:30:04,452
No response.

506
00:30:04,494 --> 00:30:05,792
They're still moving.

507
00:30:05,831 --> 00:30:08,495
Dax, how long
before Odo reaches Rakhar?

508
00:30:08,535 --> 00:30:10,971
Just over five hours.

509
00:30:11,007 --> 00:30:12,475
Miradorn vessel...

510
00:30:12,509 --> 00:30:15,309
you are in violation
of Bajoran transit regulations.

511
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:17,647
Please return at once
to the docking ring.

512
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:19,655
They've increased power
to their thrusters.

513
00:30:19,689 --> 00:30:20,646
On screen.

514
00:30:36,073 --> 00:30:39,534
You'd save time going
through the Vortex.

515
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:41,913
It's a long way around it.

516
00:30:47,927 --> 00:30:53,233
Aren't you the least bit curious
about your own people?

517
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,068
Of course, I am.

518
00:30:55,107 --> 00:30:57,737
Unfortunately,
I don't have the liberty

519
00:30:57,779 --> 00:31:00,249
of pursuing that curiosity
right now.

520
00:31:00,283 --> 00:31:02,515
They don't maintain
a humanoid shape, you know.

521
00:31:02,554 --> 00:31:06,288
They refused to assimilate
on my world.

522
00:31:06,327 --> 00:31:08,263
They're a proud species.

523
00:31:08,297 --> 00:31:11,063
That's why
they were so persecuted.

524
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:13,403
But I will say this for them...

525
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,904
they treated me well enough
when I landed at their colony.

526
00:31:17,948 --> 00:31:19,382
I was badly wounded.

527
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:21,546
They could have
allowed me to die.

528
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:22,556
They didn't.

529
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,081
You're one of them.

530
00:31:24,193 --> 00:31:25,889
That's for sure.

531
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:29,391
You have the sense
of decency, of justice...

532
00:31:29,435 --> 00:31:31,837
You don't give up, do you?

533
00:31:34,277 --> 00:31:35,575
Computer, what was that?

534
00:31:35,613 --> 00:31:37,343
A temporary loss of stability

535
00:31:37,383 --> 00:31:40,878
resulting from the impact
of a concentrated plasma charge.

536
00:31:40,923 --> 00:31:42,916
We're being attacked?

537
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,087
Affirmative.

538
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:48,431
Pursuing vessel approaching
from 181 mark 12.

539
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,770
Put it on the monitor
and identify.

540
00:31:50,807 --> 00:31:53,107
Miradorn vessel, Theta class.

541
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:54,271
He's hailing us.

542
00:31:54,313 --> 00:31:57,307
The first shot was a warning.

543
00:31:57,353 --> 00:32:00,153
You will surrender
the Rakhari prisoner to me.

544
00:32:00,224 --> 00:32:03,252
I don't give up my prisoners,
Ah-Kel.

545
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,232
Very well.

546
00:32:05,267 --> 00:32:07,635
Then you can die with him.

547
00:32:11,945 --> 00:32:14,108
Warning. Damage to shields.

548
00:32:14,216 --> 00:32:16,880
Computer, evasive maneuvers!

549
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:23,263
Warning. Shields at 41%.

550
00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:26,293
Your computer's
not going to outsmart him.

551
00:32:26,338 --> 00:32:28,102
I'm a security chief,
not a combat pilot!

552
00:32:28,141 --> 00:32:29,131
Then give me the controls!

553
00:32:29,176 --> 00:32:30,144
You?!

554
00:32:30,178 --> 00:32:31,612
I can get us through the Vortex.

555
00:32:31,647 --> 00:32:32,672
The ionized gasses

556
00:32:32,716 --> 00:32:35,118
would screen us
from his sensors.

557
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:38,888
Drop your suspicious nature
for a minute, changeling.

558
00:32:38,927 --> 00:32:42,661
Can't you see?
It's our only chance!

559
00:33:04,139 --> 00:33:05,937
Why are we slowing down?

560
00:33:05,976 --> 00:33:08,572
The Vortex is riddled
with volatile pockets

561
00:33:08,614 --> 00:33:10,276
of a gas we call <i>toh-maire.</i>

562
00:33:10,317 --> 00:33:11,683
If we destabilize them

563
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:14,417
they could ignite,
and blow this ship apart.

564
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,926
You really have been
through here before.

565
00:33:19,968 --> 00:33:22,768
Sometimes I do tell the truth.

566
00:33:22,806 --> 00:33:26,142
How do you remember
what's true and what isn't?

567
00:33:27,448 --> 00:33:30,180
I thought you said they couldn't
detect us in here.

568
00:33:30,219 --> 00:33:32,485
He must be following
our impulse wake.

569
00:33:32,524 --> 00:33:35,154
Computer,
disengage impulse engines.

570
00:33:35,195 --> 00:33:36,823
Go to thrusters.

571
00:33:36,864 --> 00:33:38,162
Acknowledged.

572
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,361
Thrusters engaged.

573
00:33:41,239 --> 00:33:42,366
What are you doing?

574
00:33:42,408 --> 00:33:44,172
Once our impulse wake drops off

575
00:33:44,211 --> 00:33:47,307
he might try to pick up
the discharge of our thrusters.

576
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,148
We'll be better off if we land.

577
00:33:49,187 --> 00:33:51,419
So, changeling

578
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:53,758
I guess I'm going
to take you home after all.

579
00:34:17,443 --> 00:34:19,071
Hurry! This way!

580
00:34:19,112 --> 00:34:20,444
Croden!

581
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:22,918
Slow down, Croden!

582
00:34:22,952 --> 00:34:25,115
Stay where I can see you.

583
00:34:27,126 --> 00:34:28,754
Croden!

584
00:34:28,796 --> 00:34:29,923
What's your hurry?

585
00:34:29,965 --> 00:34:30,933
What's in here?

586
00:34:30,966 --> 00:34:32,434
I told you... the colony.

587
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,098
Anxious to see
them again, are you?

588
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:35,266
Yes. Of course.

589
00:34:35,308 --> 00:34:37,210
Whatever it is you came
here for, you can forget it.

590
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:38,212
We're leaving.

591
00:34:38,246 --> 00:34:39,578
- No!
- Now!

592
00:34:41,486 --> 00:34:44,286
How much of it was true?
Any of it?

593
00:34:44,324 --> 00:34:45,622
Any of it?!

594
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:47,127
No. No.

595
00:34:47,162 --> 00:34:51,465
On Rakhar, we tell stories
about changelings.

596
00:34:51,504 --> 00:34:55,307
I thought they were
myths until I met you.

597
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:56,369
The stone!

598
00:34:56,412 --> 00:34:58,314
I have no idea
where it came from.

599
00:34:58,349 --> 00:35:00,819
Rakhari merchants
buy stones just like it

600
00:35:00,853 --> 00:35:02,253
from off-world traders.

601
00:35:02,289 --> 00:35:03,416
It's used as a key.

602
00:35:03,458 --> 00:35:04,926
A key to what?

603
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:07,090
To my only reason for living.

604
00:35:07,131 --> 00:35:10,125
And it's ahead,
in that cavern there.

605
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,126
Please, help me.

606
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:29,660
There's been a cave-in.

607
00:35:31,074 --> 00:35:32,804
What is it?

608
00:35:32,844 --> 00:35:34,814
A stasis chamber.

609
00:35:37,753 --> 00:35:40,121
It's my daughter.

610
00:35:40,158 --> 00:35:42,492
The only member
of my family I could save.

611
00:35:42,529 --> 00:35:43,519
Help me.

612
00:35:51,845 --> 00:35:55,807
It shapes itself
to fit the lock.

613
00:36:18,393 --> 00:36:20,829
Father?

614
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,993
I was dreaming about you.

615
00:36:23,035 --> 00:36:24,971
I'm here now, Yareth.

616
00:36:25,005 --> 00:36:27,737
You don't have to dream anymore.

617
00:36:42,235 --> 00:36:43,567
Hello.

618
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,378
This is Odo.

619
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,043
He's a security officer.

620
00:36:51,085 --> 00:36:53,385
No, no, he's not
going to hurt you.

621
00:36:53,422 --> 00:36:55,220
He's going to take you

622
00:36:55,259 --> 00:36:57,456
to a place
where you'll be safe.

623
00:36:57,497 --> 00:36:58,658
Won't you?

624
00:37:08,049 --> 00:37:10,178
Where are you going?

625
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,190
I'm going home.

626
00:37:12,223 --> 00:37:14,853
But you can't.
They'll kill you.

627
00:37:14,894 --> 00:37:17,865
Yareth, I must answer
for my crimes.

628
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,066
But all you did was
try to protect us.

629
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:24,373
Their sensors must have
picked up our life signs.

630
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:26,904
We've got to get
back to the runabout.

631
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,119
Odo!

632
00:37:38,938 --> 00:37:40,065
Is he badly hurt?

633
00:37:40,107 --> 00:37:41,735
There's no way to tell.

634
00:37:41,776 --> 00:37:44,372
I don't know anything
about his species.

635
00:37:44,414 --> 00:37:46,246
I'll carry him back to the ship.

636
00:37:51,994 --> 00:37:54,328
What's the matter, Father?

637
00:37:59,474 --> 00:38:01,340
Nothing, darling.

638
00:38:01,378 --> 00:38:04,976
Nothing.
Nothing.

639
00:38:05,018 --> 00:38:06,748
Go! Go!

640
00:38:19,878 --> 00:38:21,939
You're heavier than you look.

641
00:38:27,626 --> 00:38:29,755
You could have left me behind.

642
00:38:29,795 --> 00:38:31,320
Don't thank me.

643
00:38:31,366 --> 00:38:34,269
I already regret it.

644
00:38:34,304 --> 00:38:36,638
I haven't been able
to lose them.

645
00:38:36,675 --> 00:38:38,941
Sooner or later,
one of his photons

646
00:38:38,979 --> 00:38:40,607
is going trigger
a <i>toh-maire</i> explosion

647
00:38:40,649 --> 00:38:41,708
and kill us all.

648
00:38:46,993 --> 00:38:49,623
Let me have the controls.

649
00:38:49,665 --> 00:38:52,261
Find us
one of those <i>toh-maire</i> fields.

650
00:38:52,303 --> 00:38:54,705
I just told you, you don't want
to go anywhere near one

651
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,799
changeling.

652
00:38:55,842 --> 00:38:58,540
Find us
the closest <i>toh-maire</i> field.

653
00:39:00,184 --> 00:39:02,677
Six degrees to starboard.

654
00:39:02,722 --> 00:39:04,088
Changing course.

655
00:39:04,124 --> 00:39:06,253
He's chased us everywhere else.

656
00:39:06,295 --> 00:39:08,731
Maybe he'll follow us
in there, too.

657
00:39:08,766 --> 00:39:10,098
His sensors may not be able

658
00:39:10,135 --> 00:39:11,933
to detect
how volatile the field is.

659
00:39:11,972 --> 00:39:14,033
If he fires on us in there,
the whole thing will ignite.

660
00:39:14,076 --> 00:39:15,738
That's what I'm counting on.

661
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,760
Set a course
along the interior perimeter.

662
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:27,594
Done.

663
00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:29,626
Computer, shut down all engines.

664
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,640
Engines disengaged.

665
00:39:31,674 --> 00:39:33,472
Maintain emergency readiness

666
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,776
to reengage impulse
on my command.

667
00:39:35,814 --> 00:39:38,717
We're an awfully easy target.

668
00:39:44,764 --> 00:39:46,323
He's hailing us.

669
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:47,630
On screen.

670
00:39:47,669 --> 00:39:50,731
Are you prepared
to surrender your prisoner?

671
00:39:50,775 --> 00:39:54,578
I have a full array of Starfleet
weapons trained on you, Ah-Kel.

672
00:39:54,615 --> 00:39:55,947
Frankly, I don't
know much about them

673
00:39:55,984 --> 00:39:57,816
but I understand they
equipped this little vessel

674
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:59,015
with some
pretty powerful stuff

675
00:39:59,057 --> 00:40:00,150
so I suggest

676
00:40:00,192 --> 00:40:02,355
you withdraw
while you still can.

677
00:40:02,395 --> 00:40:05,856
There will barely be a trace
of your little vessel

678
00:40:05,902 --> 00:40:07,700
when we are finished with you.

679
00:40:10,977 --> 00:40:13,709
He's coming about.

680
00:40:13,749 --> 00:40:15,183
Powering his shields.

681
00:40:15,219 --> 00:40:18,487
His starboard photon bank
is armed.

682
00:40:18,524 --> 00:40:21,620
Computer, engage!

683
00:40:24,669 --> 00:40:26,297
He's firing photons.

684
00:40:40,635 --> 00:40:43,037
Is everybody back there
in one piece?

685
00:40:43,072 --> 00:40:44,665
Yes.

686
00:40:45,577 --> 00:40:47,706
Good.

687
00:40:47,748 --> 00:40:51,585
Take us out
of your precious Vortex.

688
00:41:05,279 --> 00:41:08,045
I only have one
last favor to ask.

689
00:41:08,084 --> 00:41:11,215
Yareth is going to be
alone on your world

690
00:41:11,256 --> 00:41:12,952
just as you've always been.

691
00:41:14,329 --> 00:41:16,959
She's going to need someone
to look after her.

692
00:41:22,644 --> 00:41:25,878
If you're asking me
what I think you're asking...

693
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:28,478
We know you could use
some company, changeling.

694
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,286
You'll deny it, but we
both know it's true

695
00:41:31,325 --> 00:41:33,488
or this stone would have
meant nothing to you.

696
00:41:33,529 --> 00:41:35,590
Incoming subspace signal.

697
00:41:35,634 --> 00:41:38,605
Vulcan band frequency.

698
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:41,439
On screen.

699
00:41:41,478 --> 00:41:42,810
Starfleet Runabout

700
00:41:42,847 --> 00:41:45,147
this is the Vulcan Science
Vessel <i>T'Vran.</i>

701
00:41:45,184 --> 00:41:46,675
Are you in any difficulty?

702
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,883
Chief of Security Odo
from DS9.

703
00:41:48,924 --> 00:41:50,153
We're fine, Captain.

704
00:41:50,193 --> 00:41:53,427
We detected a major eruption
in the Chamra Vortex.

705
00:41:53,465 --> 00:41:55,765
I was afraid a small ship
like yours

706
00:41:55,803 --> 00:41:57,567
might have suffered damage.

707
00:41:57,606 --> 00:41:59,370
I appreciate your concern.

708
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:01,106
What's your course?

709
00:42:01,146 --> 00:42:04,242
To the wormhole,
then home to Vulcan.

710
00:42:05,587 --> 00:42:07,716
I've beamed over two survivors

711
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:10,058
from a ship
that wasn't so lucky.

712
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:12,156
I have to complete a mission.

713
00:42:12,266 --> 00:42:15,397
Could you give them
transportation to Vulcan?

714
00:42:15,439 --> 00:42:16,702
Easily done.

715
00:42:16,741 --> 00:42:19,576
We will rendezvous
with you shortly.

716
00:42:19,612 --> 00:42:21,478
Prepare for transport.

717
00:42:25,122 --> 00:42:26,420
Don't thank me.

718
00:42:26,459 --> 00:42:28,121
I already regret it.

719
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,598
How?

720
00:42:32,635 --> 00:42:35,367
How will you explain
not delivering me?

721
00:42:37,411 --> 00:42:40,405
I'll tell them you were killed

722
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:42,886
when Ah-Kel torpedoed
the asteroid.

723
00:42:42,921 --> 00:42:46,451
This dissembling
must be catching.

724
00:42:46,495 --> 00:42:49,125
You're going to have
to get used to living

725
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:50,566
in an alien society.

726
00:42:50,602 --> 00:42:51,797
Like you...

727
00:42:51,837 --> 00:42:53,635
but I know where my home is

728
00:42:53,673 --> 00:42:55,141
and perhaps, someday

729
00:42:55,176 --> 00:42:57,305
I'll be able to go back again.

730
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,148
I hope this helps you
to find where you came from.

731
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:14,542
<i>T'Vran</i> to <i>Ganges.</i>

732
00:43:14,578 --> 00:43:15,671
Ready for transport.

733
00:43:15,713 --> 00:43:16,681
Stand by.

734
00:43:16,715 --> 00:43:18,776
Are you really a changeling?

735
00:43:18,819 --> 00:43:22,349
Yes...

736
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:24,385
I suppose I am.

737
00:43:30,105 --> 00:43:31,232
Go on.

738
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:33,904
We don't want to keep
the Vulcans waiting.

739
00:43:38,754 --> 00:43:40,416
Energizing.

740
00:43:53,281 --> 00:43:56,081
Computer, set a course
for the wormhole.

741
00:43:56,119 --> 00:43:57,917
Course laid in.

742
00:43:57,956 --> 00:43:59,788
Ready engines.

743
00:44:01,897 --> 00:44:03,729
Home.

744
00:44:05,235 --> 00:44:06,897
Where is it?

745
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:16,047
Someday we'll know...

746
00:44:16,088 --> 00:44:17,750
cousin.

747
00:44:21,431 --> 00:44:23,223
Engage.
