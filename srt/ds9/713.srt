00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:03,587
(<i> people laughing</i> )

2
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:06,924
BASHIR:
Well, listen up, listen up.

3
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:11,094
To Lieutenant Hector Ilario--

4
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:14,306
living proof that Starfleet
Academy produces the finest

5
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:15,641
fighter pilots
in the galaxy...

6
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,518
Hear, hear.
I haven't finished yet.

7
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,728
Don't ruin it, Julian.
That's just what a toast
should be--

8
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,271
short and to the point.

9
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,690
I wouldn't mind hearing
a little more.

10
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,691
Now, now--

11
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,192
modesty above all.

12
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,444
BASHIR: This is no time
to be modest. This man...

13
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:30,030
this youth, this mere pup
still wet behind the ears...

14
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,615
I'm 22.

15
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,784
I was speaking metaphorically.

16
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,870
This inspired
cherub

17
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,080
masterfully piloted
the<i> Defiant</i> into battle

18
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,249
against a half a dozen
Jem'Hadar attack ships

19
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:44,043
and once all the
smoke had cleared

20
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:45,587
only one ship
remained intact

21
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,088
and that, ladies
and gentlemen

22
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,717
was the USS<i> Defiant.</i>

23
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,343
The kid's a born
helmsman.

24
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,470
And so say all of us.

25
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,763
ALL:
Hear, hear!

26
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,267
Well, thanks.

27
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,602
I'm just glad to be here.

28
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,354
It's the best posting
in the galaxy.

29
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:03,814
If there's anything
you want--

30
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:05,232
anything at all--
just ask.

31
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,483
Well, there is one thing.

32
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,818
O'BRIEN:
Name it.

33
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,820
Next time you two go
to the holosuite

34
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,905
I'd like to come along.

35
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:13,657
Oh, well, I'm sorry.
Can't be done.

36
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,993
No. It's out
of the question.
It's impossible.

37
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,995
KIRA:
Don't take it personally.

38
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:21,206
They're very serious about
their leisure activities.

39
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,083
BASHIR:
It's a good way
to relieve stress.

40
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,376
Yeah. I highly
recommend it.

41
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,961
Just not with us.

42
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:28,672
Yeah. You know, when you
have a holosuite visit

43
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:30,966
it's sort of a
personal experience.

44
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,300
He's very particular

45
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,845
about anybody seeing
him in his coonskin cap.

46
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,680
You understand.

47
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,015
I suppose.

48
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,266
Gentlemen,
your holosuite is ready.

49
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,601
Terrific.

50
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,143
Now, if there's
anything else you need...

51
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,228
Just let us know.

52
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,776
Have you ever gone to
the holosuite with them?

53
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,110
Me?

54
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,111
Never.

55
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,112
Huh.

56
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,031
I know when I'm not wanted.

57
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,079
To the class
of '72.

58
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,794
Another round?

59
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,754
No.
No.

60
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,131
Time to go?

61
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,509
It was time to go
about an hour ago.

62
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,177
Okay.

63
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,808
Oh, oh, okay.
We'll get you home.

64
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,434
I'll take him.
His quarters are on my way.

65
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:23,685
You sure?

66
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,437
He won't be
the first drunken Ensign

67
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,188
I've escorted home.

68
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:30,025
Someday, remind me
to tell you about
a bar on Bolarus

69
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,944
and a certain young Mr. Sisko.

70
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,737
This way.

71
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,411
I never had real
Saurian brandy before.

72
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,246
It's Captain Sisko's favorite.

73
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,040
It kind of sneaks up
on you, doesn't it?

74
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:52,840
Speaking of sneaking up
on you...

75
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,676
here we are--
home sweet home.

76
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,683
You all right?

77
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:03,851
Do you want
some<i> raktajino?</i>

78
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,393
I'm fine. Fine.

79
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,026
I wish they could
have been there.

80
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:14,069
They would've loved it.

81
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,237
To see me fly
the<i> Defiant</i> into battle.

82
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,325
It was incredible.

83
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,410
(<i> sighs</i> )

84
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,662
I should get going.

85
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,914
Make sure you
get some sleep.

86
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,124
You know something, Lieutenant?

87
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,584
You're very beautiful.

88
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:31,962
And you're very drunk.

89
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,715
True enough

90
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,884
but in the morning,
I'll be sober

91
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,219
and you'll still be beautiful.

92
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,181
Good night, Ilario.

93
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:43,682
Good night, Lieutenant.

94
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:54,902
COMPUTER:
The time is 0600 hours.

95
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,618
The time is 0600 hours
and ten seconds.

96
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,038
Yeah, yeah. I'm up.

97
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,838
Fanalian tea. Hot.

98
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,648
(<i> voices calling outside</i> )

99
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:38,779
MALE:
Full security alert.

100
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,947
MALE 2:
Yes, sir.

101
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,031
Get everybody back.
Hurry up.

102
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,206
(<i> multiple conversations</i> )

103
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,629
(<i> gasps</i> )

104
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,800
What happened?

105
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,510
Lieutenant Ilario
has been killed.

106
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,511
Killed?

107
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,097
How?

108
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:07,474
It appears
someone shot him.

109
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,351
ODO: He was killed by
what appears to be some kind

110
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,685
of chemically propelled
projectile weapon.

111
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:16,644
SISKO: A gun?

112
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,105
Dr. Bashir recovered

113
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,941
a single tritanium bullet
from Ilario's chest.

114
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,151
He was shot through the heart.

115
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,321
You don't see
one of those every day.

116
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,489
Nobody uses projectile
weapons anymore.

117
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:29,908
You said this is
tritanium, right?

118
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,285
That's correct.

119
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:34,829
Chief, did you ever hear
of a TR-116 rifle?

120
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:38,208
It was a prototype
developed by Starfleet Security

121
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,168
to operate in
energy dampening fields

122
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,753
or radiogenic environments.

123
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:42,837
That's right.

124
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,089
Anywhere where a normal phaser

125
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,590
would be useless.

126
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,468
If I'm not mistaken,
the TR-116 rifle fired

127
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,971
a chemically propelled
tritanium bullet.

128
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,347
You say a prototype.

129
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,848
Were they ever
mass-produced?

130
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,393
No. Starfleet
abandoned the TR-116

131
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,145
in favor of
regenerative phasers.

132
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,397
That doesn't mean the killer
couldn't have gotten hold

133
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:03,317
of the rifle's
replication patterns.

134
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,986
But only Starfleet officers
have access to those files.

135
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,238
Disturbing thought, isn't it?

136
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:12,075
Starfleet officers do not go
around murdering other officers.

137
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,701
Not usually, anyway.

138
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:14,995
O'BRIEN:
Hold on a minute.

139
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,830
That's odd.

140
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,498
According to these readings

141
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,334
the bullet only traveled
eight or nine centimeters.

142
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,669
Then the killer must have
fired at point-blank range.

143
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:23,670
I don't think so.

144
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,921
There are no powder burns

145
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:25,964
on the body.

146
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,632
What are powder burns?

147
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,593
At close range, chemically
propelled weapons

148
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,804
leave residual
combustion products

149
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,056
on the skin and clothing
of the victims.

150
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,309
How did you know that?

151
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,602
I read 20th century
crime novels--

152
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,937
Raymond Chandler,
Mike Hammer--

153
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:41,896
that sort of thing.

154
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,315
Hmm.

155
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:46,109
So, if the killer did
fire from close range

156
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,695
why aren't there
any powder burns?

157
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,571
I don't know.

158
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,906
But we'll find out.

159
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,535
What was the time
of death?

160
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,454
0317.

161
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,207
That's only ten minutes
after I left.

162
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,249
Was he alone?

163
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,750
I didn't see anyone

164
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,378
but I wasn't here
for very long.

165
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,004
What do we know
about Ilario

166
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,797
outside of his
service record?

167
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:11,009
Not a great deal.
He's only been on
the station for ten days.

168
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,386
EZRI: As far as I could tell

169
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,221
he was intelligent, dedicated,
eager to please.

170
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,722
Everyone liked him.

171
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,516
Not everyone.

172
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:20,185
I want to know everything
there is to know about him--

173
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,770
who his friends were,
if he made any enemies.

174
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,273
I also want increased
security throughout the station.

175
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,233
Yes, sir.

176
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,734
And, Constable...

177
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,444
You want whoever
did this caught.

178
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,487
I understand, Captain.

179
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:36,784
BASHIR:
Ilario once told me
that he came from a big family--

180
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,995
three brothers
and two sisters.

181
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:43,083
I thought it was two brothers
and three sisters.

182
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,251
I don't think so.

183
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,293
You sure?

184
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,546
Are you?

185
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,299
Don't look at me.

186
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,301
We never discussed
his family.

187
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,845
Mostly he talked
about the Academy

188
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,431
and about the two of you.

189
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:58,515
Us?

190
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,767
He really admired
both of you.

191
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,604
We should have let him
come to the holosuite with us.

192
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,231
You're right.
We should have.

193
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:09,276
I just wish I hadn't left
his quarters so quickly.

194
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,361
Maybe he'd still be alive.

195
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,363
Or you'd be dead
right there with him.

196
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,576
Odo will catch whoever
did this, won't he?

197
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,453
If anyone can.

198
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,996
We really should have
let him come

199
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,582
to the holosuite
with us.

200
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,849
Ezri.

201
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,563
Shouldn't you
be in bed?

202
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,482
I was about to ask you
the same question.

203
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,235
I just couldn't sleep.

204
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,237
Me, neither.

205
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,031
You mustn't blame
yourself, you know

206
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,492
for Ilario's death.

207
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,868
I don't.

208
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,537
Not really.

209
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,122
Then what is it?

210
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,503
It's just knowing
that he was murdered.

211
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:12,589
It's difficult
to accept.

212
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,049
The whole concept
of someone killing

213
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,968
another person
in cold blood--

214
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:19,596
it's almost
incomprehensible, isn't it?

215
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,556
Not to me.

216
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,433
Meaning what?

217
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:27,395
Meaning that I know exactly
what it feels like...

218
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:31,441
to feel the urge,
the<i> need</i> to take a life.

219
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,652
You're talking about Joran.

220
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:35,903
He killed three people.

221
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:40,033
He was the host to
the Dax symbiont just like me.

222
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,035
He was<i> nothing</i> like you.

223
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,953
I try not to think about it.

224
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,039
Jadzia felt the same way.

225
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,833
She tried to bury his memories
as deeply as she could...

226
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,252
but they're still there.

227
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,505
The victims...

228
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,756
what they looked like.

229
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,551
They weren't your victims.

230
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,135
I know.

231
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,762
(<i> sighs</i> )

232
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:05,099
But then something
like this happens and...

233
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,311
Just the thought of someone
like him being here right now.

234
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,689
You really should
get some rest.

235
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,940
You're right.

236
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,276
Even if it does mean
lying in my bed

237
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,029
staring at the ceiling
for a few more hours.

238
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,782
Good night, Julian.

239
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:22,909
Good night.

240
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,970
ODO:
Save your complaints
for the magistrate.

241
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:47,141
Is this the one
we've been looking for?

242
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,309
Ilario's killer.

243
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,603
Quite a clever
one at that.

244
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,688
Why? Why did you do it?

245
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,025
You tell me, Counselor.

246
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,986
But... you're dead.

247
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,488
(<i> gasps</i> )

248
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,991
Don't tell me.
Tell him.

249
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,536
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

250
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,288
There's nothing
more annoying

251
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,331
than a corpse with
a mind of its own.

252
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,541
What?!

253
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,091
(<i> gasps</i> )

254
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,888
Dax to Security.

255
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,223
Odo?

256
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,017
Kira?

257
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,811
Anyone there?

258
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:35,814
Security, please, answer me!

259
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,150
(<i> gasps</i> )

260
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,443
Joran.

261
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:39,818
You recognize me.

262
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,195
How nice.

263
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,739
What do you want?

264
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,700
Respect, understanding...

265
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,535
love.

266
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,287
(<i> keyboard playing softly</i> )

267
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,682
JORAN: I wish you'd stop
being afraid of me.

268
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,891
It's not like we're strangers.

269
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,353
That worm in your belly
used to be mine

270
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,689
which means
I'm part of you.

271
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:16,648
Joran...

272
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,444
And you're part of me.

273
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,697
I'm nothing like you.

274
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,073
(<i> gasps</i> )

275
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,575
Is that so?

276
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,994
You want to find out
who killed Ilario, don't you?

277
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,538
Then what are you
waiting for?

278
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,080
Perform the Rite
of Emergence

279
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,000
and just ask for my help
and then we can get to work.

280
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,377
I don't want your help.

281
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,379
Maybe not, but you need it.

282
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,255
You murdered three people.

283
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,174
I don't want anything
to do with you.

284
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,217
Now leave me alone!

285
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,426
How can I?

286
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,804
There's nowhere else
for me to go.

287
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,724
I'm within you, Ezri,
all the time.

288
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:51,932
Use me.

289
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,351
No!

290
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,312
I can help.

291
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,523
I know how he thinks.

292
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,735
We can catch him, Ezri--
you and me together

293
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:05,988
and then we'll make him pay.

294
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,157
(<i> screams</i> )

295
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,744
(<i> gasps</i> )

296
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,963
Sisko to Dax.

Level J-17.

What is it, Ben?

299
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,970
SISKO: There's been
another murder.

300
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,065
Report.

301
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,694
ODO: Lieutenant Commander Greta
Vanderweg, Science Officer

302
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,822
human, age 37, 12 years
of service, the last three

303
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,156
here on Deep Space Nine.

304
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,366
BASHIR:
Cause of death:

305
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,951
tritanium bullet
fired at close range.

306
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,160
No powder burns.

307
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,455
Did Ilario and Vanderweg
know each other?

308
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,123
I'll look into it,
but it's doubtful.

309
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,583
Ilario was only here
for ten days.

310
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,877
Seven of them,
he was on the<i> Defiant.</i>

311
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,755
But why Ilario
and why Vanderweg?

312
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,548
Did someone have
a personal grudge

313
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,007
against either one of them

314
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:10,219
or is someone just killing
our officers at random?

315
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,763
I still can't believe
anyone in Starfleet

316
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:12,972
could be doing this.

317
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,891
There are over 900
Starfleet officers

318
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:15,975
posted on the station.

319
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,310
SISKO:
Odo, we have

320
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,479
to narrow the field
of suspects.

321
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,772
Sir.

322
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,691
How well did you do
in forensic psychology

323
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,818
at the Academy?

324
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,487
It wasn't my
favorite subject.

325
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,615
We have to find out
why the killer's doing this.

326
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,742
I'll do my best.

327
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:35,328
I wonder why he chose
a TR-116.

328
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,496
Instead of a phaser?

329
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,540
Yeah. I mean,
why use a rifle

330
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,250
if you're going to shoot
somebody from close range?

331
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,585
I don't know.

332
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,212
He or she may have, uh,
originally intended

333
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,047
to kill their victims
from a great distance

334
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,800
so they replicated
a long-range weapon.

335
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,844
Or they had some
special connection

336
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,261
to this particular rifle.

337
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,346
You know, a fetish

338
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,389
or psychological
obsession perhaps.

339
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,475
I suppose so.

340
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,059
Did you ever read
that biography I gave you

341
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,019
on Davy Crockett
last month?

342
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,355
No, but I'll get to it.

343
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:05,566
No, no. There was
this fascinating section

344
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,151
about the mythology
that grew up

345
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,903
around Crockett
and his rifle.

346
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,822
There was this notion
that a man could have

347
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,239
a special relationship
with a weapon.

348
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,574
Some frontiersmen
even went so far

349
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,117
as to give
their rifles names--

350
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,118
female ones at that--

351
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,453
thus changing
the relationship

352
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,663
between owner and object

353
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,289
to something resembling
man and woman.

354
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,920
Hmm. Maybe I'll start calling
my tricorder "Sally."

355
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,047
There's some great
tall tales in that book.

356
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,466
There's one particular story
where Crockett was supposed

357
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,677
to have put up a target
against a tree

358
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:35,471
and arranged a series
of tin frying pans nearby

359
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,430
in a complicated pattern.

360
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,765
The idea was that he was

361
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,475
going to shoot a bullet
at one of these pans

362
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,352
which would then ricochet
to another and then to another

363
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:42,645
and then to another
and then to another...

364
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:43,897
Wait a minute.

365
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,690
That's it.

366
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,317
Displaced targeting--
that's how he did it.

367
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,736
Who?

368
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,320
Well, the killer.

369
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,823
He set up an alternate
bullet trajectory--

370
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:56,492
one that didn't require
a direct line of sight

371
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,869
between him and the victim.

372
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,330
Julian, you're a genius.

373
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,373
Well, don't thank me.

374
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,000
Thank Davy Crockett.

375
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,713
What do you think?

376
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:11,925
Nice melon.

377
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,634
But what does it
have to do with us?

378
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,053
I have no idea.

379
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:16,679
All I know is that
Chief O'Brien wanted me

380
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:17,931
to bring you here.

381
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,557
He said he has
something to show us.

382
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,100
O'Brien to Science Lab.

383
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,226
Go ahead, Chief.

384
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,728
O'BRIEN:
Are you ready?

385
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:24,938
For what?

386
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,940
O'BRIEN:
You'll see.

387
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,315
First put on those goggles

388
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,150
that are on the counter
in front of you.

389
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,658
Now, take a step back
away from the melon.

390
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,496
A little further.

391
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,331
I've only done this
a couple of times.

392
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,376
How's this?

393
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,377
O'BRIEN:
Good.

394
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:55,509
Wow.

395
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:57,845
Are you all right?

396
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,639
Better than that melon.

397
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,100
It worked.

398
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,477
I was able to fire a bullet
into that melon while standing

399
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,937
outside in the corridor.

400
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:07,814
You fired
through the wall?

401
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,273
I don't see
any bullet holes.

402
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,026
I attached
a micro-transporter

403
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,444
to this TR-116.

404
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,614
When I fired, the bullet
was beamed into the room

405
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,157
a few centimeters
away from the melon.

406
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,618
Where it continued
its trajectory.

407
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:23,121
So, if the killer had
a similar transporter device

408
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:24,371
that would explain

409
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,999
the lack of powder burns
on the victims.

410
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:29,293
And by using an exographic
targeting sensor

411
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,253
he was able to scan
through the bulkheads.

412
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,924
So, he could have been firing
from anywhere on the station.

413
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:39,095
Can you trace the bullet's
transporter signatures back

414
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,596
to where the killer was
when he fired?

415
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,722
I'm afraid not.

416
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,141
The signature's
too weak.

417
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:46,185
It's an ingenious weapon.

418
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,022
Whoever he is,
he's smart.

419
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,039
Nothing.

420
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,125
No connection.

421
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,797
(<i> giggling</i> )

422
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,280
(<i> footsteps</i> )

423
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,491
(<i> footsteps stop</i> )

424
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,204
(<i> footsteps</i> )

425
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:48,956
Who's there?

426
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,001
Who is it?

427
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,175
Quark, is that you?

428
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,779
This isn't funny.

429
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,328
(<i> clattering</i> )

430
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,332
(<i> gasps</i> )

431
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,129
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Worf.

432
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:39,006
It is late.
You should be
in your quarters.

433
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,634
Were you following me?

434
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,177
It is dangerous for you

435
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:45,263
to be wandering
the Promenade alone.

436
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:47,473
You were worried about me?

437
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,725
There is a killer
on the station.

438
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,978
You have no right
to endanger yourself this way.

439
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:54,063
You<i> were</i> worried about me.

440
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,023
Thank you, Worf.

441
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,151
That's... sweet.

442
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,236
You are a fellow officer.

443
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:04,865
I would have the same concern
for Chief O'Brien or Dr. Bashir.

444
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,366
Of course.

445
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,035
I didn't mean
to imply otherwise.

446
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,369
Then we understand each other.

447
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,330
Perfectly.

448
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,208
How is the investigation coming?

449
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,211
Uh... slowly.

450
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:21,090
If I can assist you
in any way...

451
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,051
I appreciate it,
but you can't, really.

452
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,427
Nobody can.

453
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,389
Actually, that's not true.

454
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,600
There is someone
who could help

455
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,186
but I don't want to ask him.

456
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:34,436
Why?

457
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,396
It's complicated.

458
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,232
Nevertheless, if he can help...

459
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:39,817
It wouldn't be very pleasant.

460
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,906
Perhaps not, but I am certain

461
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:49,076
that you will do whatever is
necessary to complete your task.

462
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,204
And how do you know that?

463
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,957
You are Dax.

464
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,461
It<i> is</i> your way.

465
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:09,013
EZRI:
<i>I'nora, ja'kala vok...</i>

466
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,764
<i>'za Ezri...</i>

467
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,517
<i>zhian'tara rek...</i>

468
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,145
<i>pora'al Zheem Dax...</i>

469
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:20,233
<i>Tanas Rhem Joran.</i>

470
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:29,658
(<i> sighs</i> )

471
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,451
<i>'za Ezri</i>

472
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:34,538
<i>Tanas Rhem Joran.</i>

473
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:40,253
Oh, come on, Joran,
don't make me beg.

474
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:42,129
(<i> sighs</i> )

475
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,841
<i>Joran Tanas Rhem.</i>

476
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,177
<i>Vok Ezri</i>

477
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:51,097
<i>Joran Tanas Rhem.</i>

478
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,104
You won't regret this, Ezri.

479
00:23:58,104 --> 00:23:59,813
JORAN:
I promise.

480
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,362
Joran, the forgotten host

481
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,072
the outcast.

482
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,698
The murderer.

483
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,159
I'm sure you never thought
that little character trait

484
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,202
would prove useful.

485
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,331
Seems so strange
separating you from the others

486
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:19,792
seeing you standing there.

487
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,377
But I'm not really
standing here, am I?

488
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:22,753
It's all in your mind.

489
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:24,380
At least now I know
you're listening to me.

490
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,007
I've been ignored
for far too long.

491
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:30,261
Curzon and Jadzia didn't
quite know what to do with me.

492
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:33,264
They buried your memories
as deep within them as possible.

493
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:34,640
That was a mistake.

494
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,268
I have so much to offer.

495
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:39,228
We'll see about that.

496
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,316
Now, let's get to work.

497
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:44,650
We have a
killer to catch.

498
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,692
Where shall we begin?

499
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,903
I want to know
how he thinks.

500
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,863
Then we'll start
with his choice of weapons.

501
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,826
We already know how
he modified the TR-116.

502
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:56,912
But you haven't held it
in your hands, have you?

503
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,164
You haven't
looked through

504
00:24:58,164 --> 00:24:59,665
its tracking display

505
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:02,168
picked a target,
felt the power

506
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,877
as you lock
its sensors

507
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,297
on your unsuspecting prey.

508
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,882
If you want to catch
a killer, Ezri

509
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,969
you have to learn
to think like one.

510
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,356
JORAN:
Handsome weapon.

511
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:24,606
EZRI:
If you say so.

512
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,524
Come now.
Even you have to admire

513
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:28,986
the aesthetic qualities
inherent in its design.

514
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:31,822
It conveys a sense
of danger, of power.

515
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:34,492
Just looking from the
trigger to the muzzle

516
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:36,243
conjures up images
of death.

517
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,453
Take it down.

518
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,216
I meant "hold it
in your hands."

519
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:51,217
Why?

520
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:52,301
Because I want you
to feel

521
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:53,386
what the killer felt.

522
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:00,809
This isn't going to work

523
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,061
if you fight me.

524
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,270
I'm holding the gun.

525
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,938
Stop placating me.

526
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:08,150
You wanted my help.
Now do as I say.

527
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,194
Put on the
targeting display.

528
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:23,207
Now... hold the weapon as
if you're going to use it.

529
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:29,505
Feels good

530
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:30,548
doesn't it?

531
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:32,425
I've held a rifle before.

532
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:33,717
You mean in combat.

533
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,177
It's not the same thing.

534
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:37,179
That kind of killing's
too random, too chaotic.

535
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:38,514
This is more controlled.

536
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,266
You can savor the moment.

537
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,809
Now, tell me,
what do you see?

538
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,567
EZRI:
I'm moving through the different
levels of the Docking Ring.

539
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:51,277
He didn't kill anyone
in the Docking Ring.

540
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,904
Remember, you're trying
to put yourself in his mind.

541
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:54,905
Move to the Habitat Ring.

542
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:00,994
EZRI:
I'm there

543
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,496
in one of the corridors.

544
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:03,830
Good.

545
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,542
Our killer is a hunter,
so start hunting.

546
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:13,173
EZRI:
I see a Bajoran deputy.

547
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,967
JORAN:
You don't want to be
in the corridors.

548
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,552
Look in the quarters.

549
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,053
EZRI:
(<i> sighs softly</i> )

550
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,391
EZRI:
No one's here.

551
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,314
A male Starfleet officer,
an engineer, about 35.

552
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:29,273
JORAN:
Good.

553
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:30,690
We have a victim.

554
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,151
You have him
in your sights.

555
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,152
How do you feel?

556
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,570
Truth now.

557
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,654
Powerful.

558
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:37,990
In control.

559
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,409
Good. That's what
the killer's feeling.

560
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:43,245
I'm not angry
or excited.

561
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,331
You're calm, relaxed...

562
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,166
Detached.

563
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,709
Now you're getting it.

564
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,420
You do your killing
from a distance.

565
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,839
You're cold, methodical.

566
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,217
Maybe you're a scientist
or a doctor.

567
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,718
Maybe...

568
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,180
but why kill like this?

569
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,224
Why not choose a victim
on the Promenade or in Quark's?

570
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,644
If you want to
know the answer

571
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:08,270
pull the trigger.

572
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,813
Find out.

573
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:18,030
Don't think
about it.

574
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,490
<i>Do</i> it!

575
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,408
<i>Do</i> it!

576
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,700
No!

577
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,578
(<i> panting</i> )

578
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:30,250
Ezri, the gun
isn't loaded.

579
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:34,171
Then why did you tell me
to pull the trigger?

580
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,340
Do you want to know

581
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,634
what the killer
feels or don't you?

582
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:39,677
(<i> exasperated sigh</i> )

583
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:47,726
I'm sorry, Ezri.

584
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,186
I didn't mean to
push you so far.

585
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:50,604
I'm not a murderer.

586
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:52,147
I'm not<i> you.</i>

587
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,566
Maybe not, but you
have my memories.

588
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:54,900
You remember what
it was like--

589
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,444
the excitement, the passion

590
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,946
the looks on their faces
as they realized

591
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,241
we were the last thing
they'd ever see.

592
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,159
That has nothing
to do with me!

593
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,118
<i>You're</i> the killer!

594
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,580
QUARK:
Ezri?

595
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,122
I think you need
a vacation.

596
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,416
You're talking
to yourself.

597
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:11,542
(<i> sighs</i> )

598
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:13,544
I'm just thinking
out loud.

599
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:16,171
JORAN: I don't know what you see
in this Ferengi. He's repulsive.

600
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,006
Can I get you a drink
or something to eat?

601
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,966
No. We don't have time.
We have work to do.

602
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,009
No, thanks.

603
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,177
I'm not hungry,
really.

604
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,345
Well...

605
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,805
when you are,
you know where to come.

606
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:33,272
How I'd love to slip
a knife between his ribs.

607
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:36,900
I have a better idea--
let's get back to work.

608
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,860
The sooner
we find our killer

609
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,071
the sooner you and I
can part company.

610
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:43,115
I thought we were
having fun together.

611
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,658
Think again.

612
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,868
I suppose I'll have to
make myself more endearing.

613
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,954
Now, I suggest we visit
the victims' quarters

614
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,997
to see what answers
we can find there.

615
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,000
What are we looking for?

616
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,461
Clues. What else?

617
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:56,629
But we don't even know

618
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:58,380
if the killer
ever set foot in here.

619
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,673
Both victims were
in their quarters

620
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:00,966
when they were killed.

621
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,468
Is that a coincidence
or a connection?

622
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:03,885
I don't know.

623
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,137
Think about it.

624
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,930
Look around...

625
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:10,934
and remember, whatever you
see is what the killer saw.

626
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,488
What do we know
about these classmates

627
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:24,072
of Ilario's?

628
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,116
EZRI:
Odo checked
with Starfleet Command.

629
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:28,452
(<i> sighs</i> )

630
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,996
The one on the left was killed
in combat five weeks ago.

631
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,247
The one in the middle

632
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,999
is stationed
on the USS<i> Truman.</i>

633
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,375
The<i> Truman</i> hasn't come

634
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,377
anywhere near
Deep Space Nine in months.

635
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,588
Hmm... pity.

636
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,381
Keep looking.

637
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,267
(<i> door opening</i> )

638
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,729
Greta was quite
a pack rat, wasn't she?

639
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,939
She was here a long time.

640
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,983
This was home.

641
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,861
A monument
to bad taste.

642
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,781
Just an observation.

643
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,083
(<i> laughing</i> )

644
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,257
Vanderweg's husband

645
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,426
is a micropaleontologist
on Mora V.

646
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,179
She was married.

647
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:30,889
Ilario was single.

648
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,392
She was on Deep Space Nine
for three years.

649
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:34,601
He just got here.

650
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,977
She was a mature woman.

651
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,646
He was practically a kid.

652
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:38,689
(<i> sighs</i> )

653
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:40,232
Besides the uniform

654
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:42,568
they have absolutely
<i>nothing</i> in common...

655
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:47,072
which means they could've
just been chosen at random...

656
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:50,576
and if that's the case,
then we're wasting our time.

657
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,668
JORAN:
You're thinking of
giving up, aren't you?

658
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:00,627
I didn't say that.

659
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,961
You don't have to.

660
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,547
You have failure
written all over you.

661
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:05,090
I'm sorry
to disappoint you.

662
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,092
It's not the lack of
clues that's keeping you

663
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,552
from finding the
killer-- it's<i> you.</i>

664
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:09,887
Me?

665
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:11,346
You're holding
back, Ezri.

666
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:14,182
You refuse to see
with his eyes

667
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:17,603
feel with his hands,
think with his mind.

668
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,229
You want to turn me
into a killer

669
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:20,731
make me like you.

670
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:22,315
You<i> are</i> me.

671
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,442
You want me to kill someone?

672
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,193
What do you say
I start with you?

673
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,612
That's the spirit.

674
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:27,946
MAN:
Hold it!

675
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,616
Stop him!

676
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:31,658
They found him.

677
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,411
SECURITY:
Stop that man!

678
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:38,791

00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:42,294
(<i> groans</i> )

680
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:43,545
A weapon! Over there!

681
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:47,424
(<i> panting</i> )

682
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,301
Yes, yes, do it.

683
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:50,677
Do it!

684
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,304
(<i> grunts</i> )

685
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:53,806
That's enough!

686
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:55,014
(<i> panting</i> )

687
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,689
You mind explaining this?

688
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,817
I'm told that if Odo
hadn't stopped you

689
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:06,819
you'd have stabbed
Ensign Bertram.

690
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:10,280
I was trying to stop him
from getting away.

691
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,031
All right. He hit me,
I reacted...

692
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,829
I guess I overreacted.

693
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:17,788
(<i> knife clatters on table</i> )

694
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:19,205
I'd say so.

695
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,874
He could be a little
more appreciative

696
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:22,000
don't you think?

697
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,087
I'm sorry things
got out of hand

698
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,589
but Bertram
killed two people.

699
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:29,341
Bertram didn't kill anyone.

700
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,593
Then why was
a security team
chasing him?

701
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:33,011
Because a month ago

702
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:36,055
he accessed the replicator
patterns on TR-116

703
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,557
without authorization.

704
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,142
Sounds guilty to me.

705
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,978
Why would he
replicate a rifle

706
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:42,771
unless he was
going to use it?

707
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:46,065
Because he collects weapons--
Federation, Klingon, Cardassian.

708
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,860
What a coincidence.

709
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,862
That doesn't
rule him out as a suspect.

710
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:51,780
True, but the fact
that he was on Bajor

711
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,365
when the first
murder occurred does.

712
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,454
You've been under
a lot of stress lately, so...

713
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,457
Ben, please don't give up on me.

714
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,250
I can find this murderer.

715
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,085
I know I can.

716
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:08,087
I just need more time.

717
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,094
I don't know what you
and Jadzia and Curzon

718
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,429
all see in that man.

719
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:19,224
He's so insufferable,
so Starfleet.

720
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:22,101
I'm surprised the killer
hasn't targeted him.

721
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,980
I'm joking, of course

722
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,356
but he did come
perilously close

723
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,191
to derailing
our investigation.

724
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,403
And you have to take
some of the blame for that.

725
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:32,612
What did<i> I</i> do?

726
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:33,989
It's what you
didn't do, really.

727
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,156
You should have
told him about me.

728
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,241
You're kidding.

729
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,492
One word about you

730
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,202
and he'd have pulled
me off the case.

731
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,246
Well, then, I guess I'll have
to remain your little secret

732
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,206
and be glad that you're
still in his good graces.

733
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,708
Not that it
matters, really.

734
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,251
We would have
continued on

735
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,961
without Sisko's
blessing. Right?

736
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,218
What are you doing?

737
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,720
What does it look like?

738
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,431
<i>I'nora, ja'kala vok...</i>

739
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:00,515
Do you really think

740
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,100
you can get rid
of me this easily?

741
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,686
<i>Zheem Dax nah</i>
<i>sass-eye-ahn...</i>

742
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:07,773
Don't you realize
we've made Dax whole again?

743
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:09,649
<i>D'za-oo bah-zheest...</i>

744
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,401
Don't back away now.

00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:18,324
<i>Joran rhee jehr hey-dah...</i>

746
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:22,913
<i>Joran rhee jehr hey-dah.</i>

747
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:25,415
You won't catch
the killer without me.

748
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:27,751
Odo to Lieutenant Dax.

749
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:30,545
Report to
the Habitat Ring, on H-43.

750
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,757
I'm on my way.

751
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:39,012
ODO:
Petty officer
Zim Brott; Bolian.

752
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:40,889
Five years of service

753
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:41,848
on Deep Space Nine.

754
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,141
I knew him.

755
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,685
Or, at least,
Jadzia did.

756
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:49,481
He has a wife and
co-husband on Bolarus.

757
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,024
Well, so much
for the theory

758
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:52,484
that our killer
only targets humans.

759
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:53,819
Captain....

760
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,278
The bullet
pierced his heart?

761
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,197
At close range.

762
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,783
Why am I not surprised?

763
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:07,791
What if we don't catch him?

764
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,459
Will he keep shooting
Starfleet officers

765
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:11,128
till there are none
left on the station?

766
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:13,296
How could anyone
be so happy

767
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,632
with such
unattractive
children?

768
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,094
What did you say?

769
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,762
This photo.

770
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,185
That's it.

771
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,603
It's the pictures.

772
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,397
He's laughing.

773
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,191
<i>She's</i> laughing.

774
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,360
That's what the victims
have in common--

775
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,945
pictures
of laughing faces.

776
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,905
A killer who
hates laughter

777
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,365
who hates emotion.

778
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:43,409
A Vulcan.

779
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,162
All Vulcans
distrust emotions

780
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:47,372
but they don't go around
killing people for smiling.

781
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,374
This one does.

782
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:51,877
Something happened to him.

783
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:54,171
Something so
emotionally painful

784
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:56,548
it's making him
lose control.

785
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:59,634
When he looks through
the targeting sensor

786
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,679
and sees those pictures,
the laughter seems to mock him.

787
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,556
You're thinking
like he thinks.

788
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:05,431
Good, Ezri.

789
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:08,601
Computer, how many
Vulcan Starfleet officers

790
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,269
are on the station?

791
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:13,565
COMPUTER: There are 48 Vulcans
serving on Deep Space Nine.

792
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:16,526
Now all we have to do
is eliminate 47 of them.

793
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:18,277
I should tell Odo.

794
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,946
Not until
we have proof.

795
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,573
Then let's get some.

796
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:30,123
We still have 28 suspects--

797
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:32,084
Vulcans who have suffered
a personal loss of some kind.

798
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:33,585
We've narrowed
the field.

799
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:34,669
Not by enough.

800
00:37:46,223 --> 00:37:47,849
(<i> sighs</i> )

801
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:50,060
There's one thing
I don't understand--

802
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,145
if he hates laughter

803
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:53,688
then why doesn't he
seek out his victims

804
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,356
in Quark's
or the holosuite?

805
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,234
Maybe it's not
just the laughter.

806
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:59,194
You're right.

807
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:01,988
Maybe it has
something to do

808
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:05,200
with... the way
the photograph
freezes the emotion

809
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,285
making it seem
like the laughter

810
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,037
is going
to last forever.

811
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,923
Level 12, Central Core.

812
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:23,301
So, what do we do now?

813
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,344
We go back over
our list of suspects

814
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,513
see if we can't
narrow it down.

815
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,516
Then, proof or no proof,
we give the list to Odo.

816
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:40,277
Habitat Ring,
Level K-55.

817
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,532
What are you doing?

818
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:49,661
Are you addressing me?

819
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,830
Sorry.

820
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,956
Never mind.

821
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,583
It's him, Ezri.

822
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,127
I know it is.

823
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:58,586
We've found our killer.

824
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:07,679
I'm telling you

825
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:08,930
he's the one
we're looking for.

826
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,389
Look in his eyes.

827
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:16,437
By the way,
I'm Counselor Dax.

828
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:18,857
I know.

829
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:23,695
What are you doing?

830
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:24,904
He's getting away.

831
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,072
We need proof--

832
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,324
something I
can take to Odo.

833
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:28,700
And while you're
looking for that proof

834
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,243
what do you think
the Vulcan will be doing?

835
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:31,410
Let me tell you.

836
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,288
He's going to pick
another victim.

837
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:38,251
EZRI:
Science Officer Chu'lak, age 97

838
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:40,003
assigned to Deep Space Nine
three months ago.

839
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:41,880
Before that, he served
aboard the USS<i> Grissom.</i>

840
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,422
Why was he transferred?

841
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,092
The<i> Grissom</i> was destroyed
by the Jem'Hadar

842
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,094
in the battle of Ricktor Prime.

843
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,347
He was one of only
six crewmen to survive.

844
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:53,975
Six survivors
out of a crew of 1,250.

845
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:56,519
He served on that
ship for ten years.

846
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,812
Those people
who were killed

847
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,231
were his colleagues--
his friends.

848
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:00,982
That's a painful loss,
even for a Vulcan.

849
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:03,068
That doesn't
make him a killer.

850
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:04,819
But your instincts
tell you that he is.

851
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,196
Listen to your instincts.

852
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:07,364
Listen to me.

853
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:08,698
It's him.

854
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:12,535
Computer, locate
Science Officer Chu'lak.

855
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,871
COMPUTER:
Lieutenant Chu'lak
is in his quarters.

856
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,915
Seeking out
his next victim.

857
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:19,667
Computer, where are
Chu'lak's quarters?

858
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,712
COMPUTER:

860
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:43,524
What do you see?

861
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:56,037
EZRI:
He's studying something
on his computer console.

862
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,496
JORAN:
Studying what?

863
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:05,297
(<i> gasps</i> )

864
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:06,298
What is it?

865
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:07,299
Me.

866
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:09,342
My service record.

867
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:10,635
He knows
we suspect him.

868
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:14,806
EZRI: He's going
into the next room.

869
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:15,848
JORAN:
What's he doing?

870
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,311
EZRI:
He's coming back.

871
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:20,437
He's carrying
something.

872
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:22,063
It's a rifle, isn't it?

873
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:23,273
Isn't it?

874
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:27,235
EZRI:
Yes.

875
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:29,279
Shoot him.

876
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:39,914
JORAN:
Don't think about it.

877
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,082
Just do it.

878
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,085
JORAN:
Kill him.

879
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,675
(<i> gasps</i> )

880
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:56,014
Oh.

881
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,100
Congratulations.

882
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:05,940
I'm proud of you.

884
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:24,917
Go ahead.

885
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,169
Finish what you started.

886
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:31,299
Tell me, why did you do it?

887
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:35,136
Because logic demanded it.

888
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,889
What are you
waiting for?

889
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,640
He deserves to die.

890
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,059
You know that.

891
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:44,479
Follow your instincts.

892
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,030

I can't tell you

901
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,889
how much I've enjoyed
our time together.

902
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:24,352
<i>Zheem Dax...</i>

903
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:25,937
<i>nah sass-eye-ahn...</i>

904
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:28,106
<i>D'za-oo bah-zheest...</i>

905
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:36,655
<i>Joran rhee jehr hey-dah...</i>

906
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:39,451
You won't be able
to forget me

907
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:42,954
or bury me as deeply as
Curzon and Jadzia did.

908
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,038
I know.

909
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,498
I'm part
of you now.

910
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:48,876
As much as Audrid,
Torias-- any of them.

911
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,170
I'll have to be careful.

912
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,216
<i>Tu Dax</i>

913
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,469
<i>noh zhian 'vok...</i>

914
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:58,553
<i>j'zui...</i>

915
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:03,308
<i>Joran Rhem Tanas...</i>

916
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:05,017
Ezri.
