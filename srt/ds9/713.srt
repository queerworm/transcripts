1
00:00:05,884 --> 00:00:07,911
Well, listen up, listen up.

2
00:00:08,022 --> 00:00:11,461
To Lieutenant Hector Ilario...

3
00:00:11,495 --> 00:00:15,229
living proof that Starfleet
Academy produces the finest

4
00:00:15,268 --> 00:00:16,634
fighter pilots in the galaxy...

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,572
- Hear, hear.
- I haven't finished yet.

6
00:00:18,607 --> 00:00:19,575
Don't ruin it, Julian.

7
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:20,702
That's just what
a toast should be...

8
00:00:20,744 --> 00:00:21,712
short and to the point.

9
00:00:21,746 --> 00:00:23,578
I wouldn't mind hearing
a little more.

10
00:00:23,616 --> 00:00:24,641
Now, now...

11
00:00:24,684 --> 00:00:25,777
modesty above all.

12
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,083
This is no time to be modest.

13
00:00:27,122 --> 00:00:28,454
This man...

14
00:00:28,491 --> 00:00:30,961
this youth, this mere pup
still wet behind the ears...

15
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:32,554
I'm 22.

16
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:34,830
I was speaking metaphorically.

17
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:36,805
This inspired cherub

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,108
masterfully piloted
the <i>Defiant</i> into battle

19
00:00:40,145 --> 00:00:42,274
against a half a dozen
Jem'Hadar attack ships

20
00:00:42,316 --> 00:00:44,980
and once
all the smoke had cleared

21
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:46,683
only one ship remained intact

22
00:00:46,724 --> 00:00:50,823
and that, ladies and gentlemen
was the USS <i>Defiant.</i>

23
00:00:50,865 --> 00:00:52,265
The kid's a born helmsman.

24
00:00:52,301 --> 00:00:54,533
And so say all of us.

25
00:00:54,572 --> 00:00:55,801
Hear, hear!

26
00:00:59,414 --> 00:01:00,382
Well, thanks.

27
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,714
I'm just glad to be here.

28
00:01:01,751 --> 00:01:03,276
It's the best posting
in the galaxy.

29
00:01:03,321 --> 00:01:06,190
If there's anything you want...
anything at all... just ask.

30
00:01:06,226 --> 00:01:07,387
Well, there is one thing.

31
00:01:07,428 --> 00:01:08,657
Name it.

32
00:01:08,697 --> 00:01:10,963
Next time you two go
to the holosuite

33
00:01:11,034 --> 00:01:12,195
I'd like to come along.

34
00:01:13,205 --> 00:01:14,798
Oh, well, I'm sorry.
Can't be done.

35
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:15,968
No. It's out of the question.

36
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:16,978
It's impossible.

37
00:01:17,045 --> 00:01:18,981
Don't take it personally.

38
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,419
They're very serious about
their leisure activities.

39
00:01:22,455 --> 00:01:24,151
It's a good way
to relieve stress.

40
00:01:24,192 --> 00:01:25,251
Yeah. I highly recommend it.

41
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:26,762
Just not with us.

42
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:29,562
Yeah. You know, when you
have a holosuite visit

43
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:31,969
it's sort of a
personal experience.

44
00:01:32,006 --> 00:01:33,167
He's very particular

45
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:35,838
about anybody seeing
him in his coonskin cap.

46
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:37,745
You understand.

47
00:01:37,783 --> 00:01:39,012
I suppose.

48
00:01:39,085 --> 00:01:40,383
Gentlemen,
your holosuite is ready.

49
00:01:40,421 --> 00:01:41,389
Terrific.

50
00:01:41,422 --> 00:01:43,015
Now, if there's
anything else you need...

51
00:01:43,092 --> 00:01:44,082
Just let us know.

52
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:49,796
Have you ever gone to
the holosuite with them?

53
00:01:49,837 --> 00:01:51,032
Me?

54
00:01:51,106 --> 00:01:52,039
Never.

55
00:01:52,108 --> 00:01:53,041
Huh.

56
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,205
I know when I'm not wanted.

57
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:01,182
To the class of '72.

58
00:02:06,702 --> 00:02:07,829
Another round?

59
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,736
- No.
- No.

60
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:12,169
Time to go?

61
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:15,547
It was time to go
about an hour ago.

62
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:17,280
Okay.

63
00:02:18,856 --> 00:02:20,951
Oh, oh, okay.

64
00:02:20,994 --> 00:02:21,962
We'll get you home.

65
00:02:21,996 --> 00:02:23,521
I'll take him.
His quarters are on my way.

66
00:02:23,565 --> 00:02:24,533
You sure?

67
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:26,537
He won't be
the first drunken Ensign

68
00:02:26,571 --> 00:02:27,834
I've escorted home.

69
00:02:27,873 --> 00:02:31,004
Someday, remind me to tell you
about a bar on Bolarus

70
00:02:31,045 --> 00:02:32,911
and a certain young Mr. Sisko.

71
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:34,747
This way.

72
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:42,389
I never had real
Saurian brandy before.

73
00:02:42,432 --> 00:02:44,230
It's Captain Sisko's favorite.

74
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:45,999
It kind of sneaks up
on you, doesn't it?

75
00:02:51,148 --> 00:02:53,675
Speaking of sneaking up
on you...

76
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:56,713
here we are... home sweet home.

77
00:03:02,535 --> 00:03:03,560
You all right?

78
00:03:03,603 --> 00:03:04,832
Do you want some <i>raktajino?</i>

79
00:03:04,872 --> 00:03:06,431
I'm fine. Fine.

80
00:03:11,685 --> 00:03:13,051
I wish they could
have been there.

81
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:15,023
They would've loved it.

82
00:03:15,057 --> 00:03:17,323
To see me fly
the <i>Defiant</i> into battle.

83
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,361
It was incredible.

84
00:03:23,339 --> 00:03:24,568
I should get going.

85
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:26,669
Make sure you get some sleep.

86
00:03:26,712 --> 00:03:28,237
You know something, Lieutenant?

87
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:30,678
You're very beautiful.

88
00:03:31,688 --> 00:03:33,122
And you're very drunk.

89
00:03:34,393 --> 00:03:35,656
True enough

90
00:03:35,695 --> 00:03:37,927
but in the morning,
I'll be sober

91
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:40,334
and you'll still be beautiful.

92
00:03:41,572 --> 00:03:43,097
Good night, Ilario.

93
00:03:43,142 --> 00:03:44,701
Good night, Lieutenant.

94
00:03:53,093 --> 00:03:55,893
The time is 0600 hours.

95
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:04,669
The time is 0600 hours
and ten seconds.

96
00:04:04,713 --> 00:04:06,945
Yeah, yeah. I'm up.

97
00:04:13,396 --> 00:04:15,798
Fanalian tea. Hot.

98
00:04:38,641 --> 00:04:39,802
Full security alert.

99
00:04:39,843 --> 00:04:40,811
Yes, sir.

100
00:04:40,845 --> 00:04:42,177
Get everybody back.
Hurry up.

101
00:04:59,812 --> 00:05:00,973
What happened?

102
00:05:01,015 --> 00:05:03,542
Lieutenant Ilario
has been killed.

103
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:04,645
Killed?

104
00:05:04,688 --> 00:05:05,883
How?

105
00:05:05,924 --> 00:05:08,622
It appears someone shot him.

106
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:11,522
He was killed by what appears
to be some kind

107
00:07:11,562 --> 00:07:13,657
of chemically propelled
projectile weapon.

108
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:14,667
A gun?

109
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:15,794
Dr. Bashir recovered

110
00:07:15,837 --> 00:07:18,535
a single tritanium bullet
from Ilario's chest.

111
00:07:18,575 --> 00:07:20,841
He was shot through the heart.

112
00:07:22,248 --> 00:07:24,275
You don't see one of those
every day.

113
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,083
Nobody uses projectile
weapons anymore.

114
00:07:26,122 --> 00:07:27,681
You said this is tritanium,
right?

115
00:07:27,724 --> 00:07:28,885
That's correct.

116
00:07:28,926 --> 00:07:32,365
Chief, did you ever hear
of a TR-116 rifle?

117
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,894
It was a prototype
developed by Starfleet Security

118
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:37,875
to operate in
energy dampening fields

119
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:39,343
or radiogenic environments.

120
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:40,210
That's right.

121
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:41,806
Anywhere where a normal phaser

122
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,079
would be useless.

123
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:45,954
If I'm not mistaken,
the TR-116 rifle fired

124
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:48,518
a chemically propelled
tritanium bullet.

125
00:07:48,562 --> 00:07:49,996
You say a prototype.

126
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:51,363
Were they ever mass-produced?

127
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,200
No. Starfleet
abandoned the TR-116

128
00:07:54,238 --> 00:07:55,831
in favor
of regenerative phasers.

129
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,141
That doesn't mean the killer
couldn't have gotten hold

130
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,844
of the rifle's
replication patterns.

131
00:08:00,884 --> 00:08:03,582
But only Starfleet officers
have access to those files.

132
00:08:03,622 --> 00:08:05,785
Disturbing thought, isn't it?

133
00:08:05,826 --> 00:08:09,595
Starfleet officers do not go
around murdering other officers.

134
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:11,260
Not usually, anyway.

135
00:08:11,303 --> 00:08:12,703
Hold on a minute.

136
00:08:12,738 --> 00:08:14,331
That's odd.

137
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,866
According to these readings

138
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:17,938
the bullet only traveled
eight or nine centimeters.

139
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:20,315
Then the killer must have
fired at point-blank range.

140
00:08:20,352 --> 00:08:21,251
I don't think so.

141
00:08:21,287 --> 00:08:23,484
There are no powder burns
on the body.

142
00:08:23,525 --> 00:08:25,255
What are powder burns?

143
00:08:25,294 --> 00:08:28,231
At close range, chemically
propelled weapons

144
00:08:28,267 --> 00:08:30,328
leave residual
combustion products

145
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,636
on the skin and clothing
of the victims.

146
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,735
How did you know that?

147
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:37,180
I read 20th century
crime novels...

148
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,652
Raymond Chandler, Mike Hammer...
that sort of thing.

149
00:08:39,754 --> 00:08:40,847
Hmm.

150
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:43,553
So, if the killer did
fire from close range

151
00:08:43,594 --> 00:08:44,748
why aren't there
any powder burns?

152
00:08:44,748 --> 00:08:46,273
Why aren't there
any powder burns?

153
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,219
I don't know.

154
00:08:48,254 --> 00:08:49,620
But we'll find out.

155
00:08:51,928 --> 00:08:53,123
What was the time of death?

156
00:08:53,163 --> 00:08:54,995
0317.

157
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:57,868
That's only ten minutes
after I left.

158
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:58,963
Was he alone?

159
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:00,440
I didn't see anyone

160
00:09:00,475 --> 00:09:01,966
but I wasn't here for very long.

161
00:09:02,012 --> 00:09:05,507
What do we know about Ilario
outside of his service record?

162
00:09:05,551 --> 00:09:06,576
Not a great deal.

163
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,282
He's only been on
the station for ten days.

164
00:09:08,324 --> 00:09:09,417
As far as I could tell

165
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:11,861
he was intelligent, dedicated,
eager to please.

166
00:09:11,897 --> 00:09:13,365
Everyone liked him.

167
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:14,958
Not everyone.

168
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:17,598
I want to know everything
there is to know about him...

169
00:09:17,707 --> 00:09:20,143
who his friends were,
if he made any enemies.

170
00:09:20,178 --> 00:09:22,842
I also want increased
security throughout the station.

171
00:09:22,883 --> 00:09:23,851
Yes, sir.

172
00:09:23,885 --> 00:09:25,376
And, Constable...

173
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,013
You want whoever did this
caught.

174
00:09:27,057 --> 00:09:28,184
I understand, Captain.

175
00:09:30,496 --> 00:09:34,367
Ilario once told me
that he came from a big family...

176
00:09:34,404 --> 00:09:36,499
three brothers and two sisters.

177
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,604
I thought it was two brothers
and three sisters.

178
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:41,844
I don't think so.

179
00:09:41,884 --> 00:09:42,874
You sure?

180
00:09:44,254 --> 00:09:45,313
Are you?

181
00:09:47,193 --> 00:09:48,821
Don't look at me.

182
00:09:48,863 --> 00:09:50,833
We never discussed his family.

183
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:53,394
Mostly he talked
about the Academy

184
00:09:53,438 --> 00:09:55,031
and about the two of you.

185
00:09:55,074 --> 00:09:56,133
Us?

186
00:09:56,176 --> 00:09:58,510
He really admired both of you.

187
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:02,484
We should have let him
come to the holosuite with us.

188
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:03,921
You're right.
We should have.

189
00:10:03,957 --> 00:10:06,792
I just wish I hadn't left
his quarters so quickly.

190
00:10:06,828 --> 00:10:09,128
Maybe he'd still be alive.

191
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,193
Or you'd be dead
right there with him.

192
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,235
Odo will catch whoever
did this, won't he?

193
00:10:15,277 --> 00:10:17,109
If anyone can.

194
00:10:17,147 --> 00:10:19,549
We really should have
let him come

195
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,383
to the holosuite with us.

196
00:10:38,486 --> 00:10:39,613
Ezri.

197
00:10:42,092 --> 00:10:44,028
Shouldn't you be in bed?

198
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:46,328
I was about to ask you
the same question.

199
00:10:48,102 --> 00:10:49,934
I just couldn't sleep.

200
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:51,771
Me, neither.

201
00:10:51,842 --> 00:10:54,608
You mustn't blame
yourself, you know

202
00:10:54,648 --> 00:10:56,173
for Ilario's death.

203
00:10:56,217 --> 00:10:58,653
I don't.

204
00:10:58,688 --> 00:11:00,179
Not really.

205
00:11:00,224 --> 00:11:01,783
Then what is it?

206
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:07,166
It's just knowing
that he was murdered.

207
00:11:07,204 --> 00:11:10,198
It's difficult to accept.

208
00:11:10,242 --> 00:11:12,576
The whole concept
of someone killing

209
00:11:12,613 --> 00:11:14,583
another person in cold blood...

210
00:11:14,617 --> 00:11:17,213
it's almost
incomprehensible, isn't it?

211
00:11:17,255 --> 00:11:19,157
Not to me.

212
00:11:19,192 --> 00:11:21,219
Meaning what?

213
00:11:21,262 --> 00:11:24,894
Meaning that I know exactly
what it feels like...

214
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:29,205
to feel the urge,
the need to take a life.

215
00:11:29,243 --> 00:11:31,338
You're talking about Joran.

216
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,543
He killed three people.

217
00:11:33,585 --> 00:11:37,718
He was the host to
the Dax symbiont just like me.

218
00:11:37,758 --> 00:11:39,785
He was nothing like you.

219
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:41,525
I try not to think about it.

220
00:11:41,565 --> 00:11:43,467
Jadzia felt the same way.

221
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:46,440
She tried to bury his memories
as deeply as she could...

222
00:11:46,474 --> 00:11:48,967
but they're still there.

223
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:51,175
The victims...

224
00:11:51,216 --> 00:11:53,550
what they looked like.

225
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,283
They weren't your victims.

226
00:11:55,323 --> 00:11:56,848
I know.

227
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,296
But then something
like this happens and...

228
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,770
Just the thought of someone
like him being here right now.

229
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:08,302
You really should get some rest.

230
00:12:08,347 --> 00:12:10,476
You're right.

231
00:12:10,517 --> 00:12:12,783
Even if it does mean
lying in my bed

232
00:12:12,855 --> 00:12:15,724
staring at the ceiling
for a few more hours.

233
00:12:18,164 --> 00:12:19,325
Good night, Julian.

234
00:12:19,366 --> 00:12:20,629
Good night.

235
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,693
Save your complaints
for the magistrate.

236
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:44,837
Is this the one
we've been looking for?

237
00:12:44,913 --> 00:12:45,846
Ilario's killer.

238
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:47,349
Quite a clever one at that.

239
00:12:47,384 --> 00:12:49,479
Why? Why did you do it?

240
00:12:52,193 --> 00:12:53,855
You tell me, Counselor.

241
00:12:53,895 --> 00:12:56,764
But... you're dead.

242
00:12:58,471 --> 00:13:01,602
Don't tell me.
Tell him.

243
00:13:01,643 --> 00:13:04,045
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

244
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,810
There's nothing more annoying

245
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:08,117
than a corpse
with a mind of its own.

246
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,315
What?!

247
00:13:20,743 --> 00:13:23,441
Dax to Security.

248
00:13:23,482 --> 00:13:24,848
Odo?

249
00:13:24,951 --> 00:13:27,547
Kira?

250
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:30,389
Anyone there?

251
00:13:30,428 --> 00:13:33,399
Security, please, answer me!

252
00:13:34,969 --> 00:13:36,096
Joran.

253
00:13:36,138 --> 00:13:37,401
You recognize me.

254
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,875
How nice.

255
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,344
What do you want?

256
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:43,282
Respect, understanding...

257
00:13:43,318 --> 00:13:44,980
Love.

258
00:14:04,322 --> 00:14:06,315
I wish you'd stop being
afraid of me.

259
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:08,295
It's not like we're strangers.

260
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,823
That worm in your belly
used to be mine

261
00:14:10,868 --> 00:14:13,236
which means I'm part of you.

262
00:14:13,271 --> 00:14:14,398
Joran...

263
00:14:17,413 --> 00:14:19,075
And you're part of me.

264
00:14:19,115 --> 00:14:21,517
I'm nothing like you.

265
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,020
Is that so?

266
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:28,087
You want to find out
who killed Ilario, don't you?

267
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:29,531
Then what are you waiting for?

268
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:31,001
Perform the Rite of Emergence

269
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,906
and just ask for my help
and then we can get to work.

270
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:35,240
I don't want your help.

271
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:37,271
Maybe not, but you need it.

272
00:14:37,315 --> 00:14:39,308
You murdered three people.

273
00:14:39,351 --> 00:14:41,149
I don't want anything
to do with you.

274
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:42,157
Now leave me alone!

275
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:43,420
How can I?

276
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,487
There's nowhere else
for me to go.

277
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:48,295
I'm within you, Ezri,
all the time.

278
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:49,768
Use me.

279
00:14:49,804 --> 00:14:51,204
No!

280
00:14:52,242 --> 00:14:53,767
I can help.

281
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:55,940
I know how he thinks.

282
00:14:55,982 --> 00:14:59,352
We can catch him, Ezri...
you and me together

283
00:14:59,387 --> 00:15:03,656
and then we'll make him pay.

284
00:15:18,956 --> 00:15:20,515
Sisko to Dax.

285
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,189
Report to Habitat Ring,
Level J-17.

286
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,928
What is it, Ben?

287
00:15:26,036 --> 00:15:27,664
There's been another murder.

288
00:15:38,392 --> 00:15:39,587
Report.

289
00:15:39,627 --> 00:15:43,327
Lieutenant Commander Greta
Vanderweg, Science Officer

290
00:15:43,366 --> 00:15:46,359
human, age 37, 12 years
of service, the last three

291
00:15:46,493 --> 00:15:47,791
here on Deep Space 9.

292
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:48,795
Cause of death...

293
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:50,925
tritanium bullet
fired at close range.

294
00:15:50,968 --> 00:15:52,095
No powder burns.

295
00:15:52,137 --> 00:15:54,539
Did Ilario and Vanderweg
know each other?

296
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:56,202
I'll look into it,
but it's doubtful.

297
00:15:56,244 --> 00:15:57,769
Ilario was only here
for ten days.

298
00:15:57,814 --> 00:15:59,807
Seven of them,
he was on the <i>Defiant.</i>

299
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,889
But why Ilario
and why Vanderweg?

300
00:16:02,923 --> 00:16:04,619
Did someone have
a personal grudge

301
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,992
against either one of them

302
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:09,195
or is someone just killing
our officers at random?

303
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:10,759
I still can't believe
anyone in Starfleet

304
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,771
could be doing this.

305
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,900
There are over 900
Starfleet officers

306
00:16:13,943 --> 00:16:15,172
posted on the station.

307
00:16:15,212 --> 00:16:18,378
Odo, we have
to narrow the field of suspects.

308
00:16:18,418 --> 00:16:19,716
Sir.

309
00:16:19,753 --> 00:16:22,724
How well did you do
in forensic psychology

310
00:16:22,758 --> 00:16:23,783
at the Academy?

311
00:16:23,894 --> 00:16:26,626
It wasn't my favorite subject.

312
00:16:26,665 --> 00:16:29,568
We have to find out
why the killer's doing this.

313
00:16:29,604 --> 00:16:31,801
I'll do my best.

314
00:16:31,841 --> 00:16:34,437
I wonder why he chose
a TR-116.

315
00:16:34,479 --> 00:16:35,674
Instead of a phaser?

316
00:16:35,715 --> 00:16:38,743
Yeah. I mean, why use a rifle

317
00:16:38,787 --> 00:16:40,415
if you're going to shoot
somebody from close range?

318
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,482
I don't know.

319
00:16:41,526 --> 00:16:44,190
He or she may have, uh,
originally intended

320
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,062
to kill their victims
from a great distance

321
00:16:46,101 --> 00:16:47,763
so they replicated
a long-range weapon.

322
00:16:47,803 --> 00:16:49,830
Or they had some
special connection

323
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,433
to this particular rifle.

324
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:52,502
You know, a fetish

325
00:16:52,546 --> 00:16:54,539
or psychological obsession
perhaps.

326
00:16:54,582 --> 00:16:56,414
I suppose so.

327
00:16:56,452 --> 00:16:58,080
Did you ever read
that biography I gave you

328
00:16:58,122 --> 00:16:59,181
on Davy Crockett last month?

329
00:16:59,224 --> 00:17:01,319
No, but I'll get to it.

330
00:17:01,361 --> 00:17:04,629
No, no. There was
this fascinating section

331
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:07,798
about the mythology that grew up
around Crockett and his rifle.

332
00:17:07,906 --> 00:17:09,636
There was this notion
that a man could have

333
00:17:09,676 --> 00:17:11,167
a special relationship
with a weapon.

334
00:17:11,212 --> 00:17:12,646
Some frontiersmen
even went so far

335
00:17:12,682 --> 00:17:14,048
as to give
their rifles names...

336
00:17:14,084 --> 00:17:15,177
female ones at that...

337
00:17:15,219 --> 00:17:17,553
thus changing the relationship
between owner and object

338
00:17:17,591 --> 00:17:19,389
to something resembling
man and woman.

339
00:17:21,197 --> 00:17:25,000
Hmm. Maybe I'll start calling
my tricorder "Sally."

340
00:17:25,037 --> 00:17:27,132
There's some great tall tales
in that book.

341
00:17:27,174 --> 00:17:29,610
There's one particular story
where Crockett was supposed

342
00:17:29,645 --> 00:17:31,808
to have put up a target
against a tree

343
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:34,581
and arranged a series
of tin frying pans nearby

344
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:35,748
in a complicated pattern.

345
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:36,848
The idea was that he was

346
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:38,416
going to shoot a bullet
at one of these pans

347
00:17:38,461 --> 00:17:40,397
which would then ricochet
to another and then to another

348
00:17:40,431 --> 00:17:41,729
and then to another
and then to another...

349
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:42,962
Wait a minute.

350
00:17:43,003 --> 00:17:44,767
That's it.

351
00:17:44,806 --> 00:17:47,299
Displaced targeting...
that's how he did it.

352
00:17:47,344 --> 00:17:48,744
Who?

353
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,408
Well, the killer.

354
00:17:50,449 --> 00:17:52,885
He set up an alternate
bullet trajectory...

355
00:17:52,954 --> 00:17:55,618
one that didn't require
a direct line of sight

356
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,093
between him and the victim.

357
00:17:58,531 --> 00:18:00,397
Julian, you're a genius.

358
00:18:00,434 --> 00:18:01,493
Well, don't thank me.

359
00:18:01,536 --> 00:18:03,129
Thank Davy Crockett.

360
00:18:06,278 --> 00:18:07,906
What do you think?

361
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,014
Nice melon.

362
00:18:11,054 --> 00:18:13,047
But what does it
have to do with us?

363
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,115
I have no idea.

364
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:15,718
All I know is that
Chief O'Brien wanted me

365
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,729
to bring you here.

366
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,629
He said he has
something to show us.

367
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:20,226
O'Brien to Science Lab.

368
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,431
Go ahead, Chief.

369
00:18:21,472 --> 00:18:22,735
Are you ready?

370
00:18:22,774 --> 00:18:24,242
For what?

371
00:18:24,277 --> 00:18:25,870
You'll see.

372
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,242
First put on those goggles

373
00:18:27,283 --> 00:18:29,276
that are on the counter
in front of you.

374
00:18:34,195 --> 00:18:36,893
Now, take a step back
away from the melon.

375
00:18:40,406 --> 00:18:41,704
A little further.

376
00:18:41,742 --> 00:18:43,644
I've only done this
a couple of times.

377
00:18:45,081 --> 00:18:46,572
How's this?

378
00:18:46,617 --> 00:18:47,482
Good.

379
00:18:52,328 --> 00:18:54,594
Wow.

380
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,863
Are you all right?

381
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,700
Better than that melon.

382
00:18:58,739 --> 00:18:59,934
It worked.

383
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,510
I was able to fire a bullet
into that melon while standing

384
00:19:03,548 --> 00:19:04,880
outside in the corridor.

385
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,886
You fired through the wall?

386
00:19:06,953 --> 00:19:08,444
I don't see any bullet holes.

387
00:19:08,489 --> 00:19:12,326
I attached a micro-transporter
to this TR-116.

388
00:19:12,364 --> 00:19:15,666
When I fired, the bullet
was beamed into the room

389
00:19:15,702 --> 00:19:17,136
a few centimeters
away from the melon.

390
00:19:17,172 --> 00:19:19,734
Where it continued
its trajectory.

391
00:19:19,776 --> 00:19:22,246
So, if the killer had
a similar transporter device

392
00:19:22,281 --> 00:19:23,249
that would explain

393
00:19:23,283 --> 00:19:25,149
the lack of powder burns
on the victims.

394
00:19:25,187 --> 00:19:28,283
And by using an exographic
targeting sensor

395
00:19:28,325 --> 00:19:30,420
he was able to scan
through the bulkheads.

396
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:34,026
So, he could have been firing
from anywhere on the station.

397
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:38,099
Can you trace the bullet's
transporter signatures back

398
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:39,702
to where the killer was
when he fired?

399
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:40,713
I'm afraid not.

400
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:42,147
The signature's too weak.

401
00:19:42,183 --> 00:19:45,177
It's an ingenious weapon.

402
00:19:45,223 --> 00:19:48,194
Whoever he is, he's smart.

403
00:20:03,856 --> 00:20:05,222
Nothing.

404
00:20:06,461 --> 00:20:08,293
No connection.

405
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:48,196
Who's there?

406
00:20:49,738 --> 00:20:51,229
Who is it?

407
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,386
Quark, is that you?

408
00:21:17,121 --> 00:21:19,023
This isn't funny.

409
00:21:33,383 --> 00:21:35,353
Worf.

410
00:21:35,387 --> 00:21:37,083
It is late.

411
00:21:37,157 --> 00:21:38,182
You should be in your quarters.

412
00:21:38,225 --> 00:21:40,787
Were you following me?

413
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,230
It is dangerous for you

414
00:21:42,266 --> 00:21:44,463
to be wandering
the Promenade alone.

415
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,700
You were worried about me?

416
00:21:46,741 --> 00:21:48,711
There is a killer
on the station.

417
00:21:48,745 --> 00:21:51,113
You have no right
to endanger yourself this way.

418
00:21:51,216 --> 00:21:53,243
You were worried about me.

419
00:21:53,286 --> 00:21:55,256
Thank you, Worf.

420
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,385
That's... sweet.

421
00:21:57,426 --> 00:21:59,328
You are a fellow officer.

422
00:21:59,363 --> 00:22:04,066
I would have the same concern
for Chief O'Brien or Dr. Bashir.

423
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:05,402
Of course.

424
00:22:05,441 --> 00:22:07,205
I didn't mean
to imply otherwise.

425
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:08,576
Then we understand each other.

426
00:22:08,613 --> 00:22:10,515
Perfectly.

427
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,419
How is the investigation coming?

428
00:22:13,455 --> 00:22:17,224
Uh... slowly.

429
00:22:17,262 --> 00:22:20,462
If I can assist you
in any way...

430
00:22:20,502 --> 00:22:23,029
I appreciate it,
but you can't, really.

431
00:22:23,073 --> 00:22:24,598
Nobody can.

432
00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:28,643
Actually, that's not true.

433
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:30,048
There is someone
who could help

434
00:22:30,086 --> 00:22:32,420
but I don't want to ask him.

435
00:22:32,457 --> 00:22:33,720
Why?

436
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:35,591
It's complicated.

437
00:22:35,629 --> 00:22:37,495
Nevertheless, if he can help...

438
00:22:37,533 --> 00:22:39,058
It wouldn't be very pleasant.

439
00:22:41,373 --> 00:22:44,812
Perhaps not, but I am certain

440
00:22:44,845 --> 00:22:48,306
that you will do whatever is
necessary to complete your task.

441
00:22:48,351 --> 00:22:49,914
And how do you know that?

442
00:22:51,718 --> 00:22:53,654
You are Dax.

443
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:58,161
It is your way.

444
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,509
<i>I'nora, ja'kala vok...</i>

445
00:23:07,546 --> 00:23:09,310
<i>'za Ezri...</i>

446
00:23:09,349 --> 00:23:12,115
<i>zhian'tara rek...</i>

447
00:23:12,154 --> 00:23:14,750
<i>pora'al Zheem Dax...</i>

448
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:18,821
<i>Tanas Rhem Joran.</i>

449
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:30,219
<i>'Za Ezri</i>

450
00:23:30,254 --> 00:23:33,089
<i>Tanas Rhem Joran.</i>

451
00:23:34,861 --> 00:23:38,698
Oh, come on, Joran,
don't make me beg.

452
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:44,373
<i>Joran Tanas Rhem.</i>

453
00:23:44,412 --> 00:23:46,644
<i>Vok Ezri</i>

454
00:23:46,683 --> 00:23:49,745
<i>Joran Tanas Rhem.</i>

455
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,662
You won't regret this, Ezri.

456
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:58,533
I promise.

457
00:24:02,377 --> 00:24:04,904
Joran, the forgotten host

458
00:24:04,949 --> 00:24:06,508
the outcast.

459
00:24:06,552 --> 00:24:08,043
The murderer.

460
00:24:08,088 --> 00:24:10,581
I'm sure you never thought
that little character trait

461
00:24:10,626 --> 00:24:11,924
would prove useful.

462
00:24:13,164 --> 00:24:15,930
Seems so strange
separating you from the others

463
00:24:15,969 --> 00:24:18,132
seeing you standing there.

464
00:24:18,173 --> 00:24:20,302
But I'm not really
standing here, am I?

465
00:24:20,344 --> 00:24:21,312
It's all in your mind.

466
00:24:21,346 --> 00:24:22,814
At least now I know
you're listening to me.

467
00:24:22,848 --> 00:24:25,318
I've been ignored
for far too long.

468
00:24:25,353 --> 00:24:29,087
Curzon and Jadzia didn't
quite know what to do with me.

469
00:24:29,126 --> 00:24:31,858
They buried your memories
as deep within them as possible.

470
00:24:31,898 --> 00:24:33,389
That was a mistake.

471
00:24:33,433 --> 00:24:36,097
I have so much to offer.

472
00:24:36,138 --> 00:24:38,004
We'll see about that.

473
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,677
Now, let's get to work.

474
00:24:41,782 --> 00:24:43,410
We have a killer to catch.

475
00:24:43,451 --> 00:24:44,578
Where shall we begin?

476
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,681
I want to know how he thinks.

477
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:48,852
Then we'll start
with his choice of weapons.

478
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,694
We already know how
he modified the TR-116.

479
00:24:52,769 --> 00:24:55,865
But you haven't held it
in your hands, have you?

480
00:24:55,907 --> 00:24:58,469
You haven't looked through
its tracking display

481
00:24:58,512 --> 00:25:02,645
picked a target, felt the power
as you lock its sensors

482
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,156
on your unsuspecting prey.

483
00:25:05,191 --> 00:25:07,627
If you want to catch
a killer, Ezri

484
00:25:07,662 --> 00:25:10,862
you have to learn
to think like one.

485
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:22,583
Handsome weapon.

486
00:25:22,623 --> 00:25:23,682
If you say so.

487
00:25:23,724 --> 00:25:25,454
Come now.
Even you have to admire

488
00:25:25,494 --> 00:25:28,021
the aesthetic qualities
inherent in its design.

489
00:25:28,065 --> 00:25:30,900
It conveys a sense
of danger, of power.

490
00:25:30,937 --> 00:25:33,635
Just looking from the
trigger to the muzzle

491
00:25:33,675 --> 00:25:35,405
conjures up images of death.

492
00:25:35,445 --> 00:25:36,572
Take it down.

493
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:49,399
I meant "hold it in your hands."

494
00:25:49,437 --> 00:25:50,496
Why?

495
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:52,532
Because I want you to feel
what the killer felt.

496
00:25:58,219 --> 00:26:01,315
This isn't going to work
if you fight me.

497
00:26:01,358 --> 00:26:02,451
I'm holding the gun.

498
00:26:02,493 --> 00:26:03,961
Stop placating me.

499
00:26:03,997 --> 00:26:07,197
You wanted my help.
Now do as I say.

500
00:26:07,235 --> 00:26:09,330
Put on the targeting display.

501
00:26:18,924 --> 00:26:23,091
Now... hold the weapon as
if you're going to use it.

502
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,508
Feels good, doesn't it?

503
00:26:30,544 --> 00:26:32,342
I've held a rifle before.

504
00:26:32,381 --> 00:26:33,679
You mean in combat.

505
00:26:33,716 --> 00:26:35,014
It's not the same thing.

506
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,954
That kind of killing's
too random, too chaotic.

507
00:26:36,989 --> 00:26:38,457
This is more controlled.

508
00:26:38,492 --> 00:26:40,051
You can savor the moment.

509
00:26:40,094 --> 00:26:42,690
Now, tell me, what do you see?

510
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,570
I'm moving through the different
levels of the Docking Ring.

511
00:26:49,612 --> 00:26:51,103
He didn't kill anyone
in the Docking Ring.

512
00:26:51,148 --> 00:26:53,744
Remember, you're trying
to put yourself in his mind.

513
00:26:53,786 --> 00:26:54,947
Move to the Habitat Ring.

514
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:02,426
I'm there,
in one of the corridors.

515
00:27:02,468 --> 00:27:03,663
Good.

516
00:27:03,703 --> 00:27:06,435
Our killer is a hunter,
so start hunting.

517
00:27:11,652 --> 00:27:13,245
I see a Bajoran deputy.

518
00:27:13,288 --> 00:27:14,881
You don't want to be
in the corridors.

519
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,483
Look in the quarters.

520
00:27:20,801 --> 00:27:22,292
No one's here.

521
00:27:24,641 --> 00:27:28,171
A male Starfleet officer,
an engineer, about 35.

522
00:27:28,215 --> 00:27:29,205
Good.

523
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,377
We have a victim.

524
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:32,115
You have him in your sights.

525
00:27:32,155 --> 00:27:33,123
How do you feel?

526
00:27:33,157 --> 00:27:34,489
Truth now.

527
00:27:34,526 --> 00:27:36,689
Powerful.

528
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:37,698
In control.

529
00:27:37,732 --> 00:27:40,259
Good. That's what
the killer's feeling.

530
00:27:40,303 --> 00:27:43,035
I'm not angry or excited.

531
00:27:43,075 --> 00:27:45,102
You're calm, relaxed...

532
00:27:45,144 --> 00:27:46,976
Detached.

533
00:27:47,015 --> 00:27:49,417
Now you're getting it.

534
00:27:49,453 --> 00:27:51,183
You do your killing
from a distance.

535
00:27:51,222 --> 00:27:53,749
You're cold, methodical.

536
00:27:53,793 --> 00:27:56,993
Maybe you're a scientist
or a doctor.

537
00:27:57,033 --> 00:27:58,626
Maybe...

538
00:27:58,669 --> 00:28:00,832
but why kill like this?

539
00:28:00,873 --> 00:28:04,039
Why not choose a victim
on the Promenade or in Quark's?

540
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:07,984
If you want to know the answer,
pull the trigger.

541
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,818
Find out.

542
00:28:16,067 --> 00:28:17,262
Don't think about it.

543
00:28:18,505 --> 00:28:21,374
Do it!
Do it!

544
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,571
No!

545
00:28:27,554 --> 00:28:30,184
Ezri, the gun isn't loaded.

546
00:28:31,862 --> 00:28:34,128
Then why did you tell me
to pull the trigger?

547
00:28:34,934 --> 00:28:36,163
Do you want to know

548
00:28:36,203 --> 00:28:38,503
what the killer
feels or don't you?

549
00:28:46,488 --> 00:28:47,456
I'm sorry, Ezri.

550
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,981
I didn't mean
to push you so far.

551
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:50,518
I'm not a murderer.

552
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:52,031
I'm not you.

553
00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:53,328
Maybe not,
but you have my memories.

554
00:28:53,368 --> 00:28:54,768
You remember what it was like...

555
00:28:54,803 --> 00:28:57,205
the excitement, the passion

556
00:28:57,241 --> 00:28:59,837
the looks on their faces
as they realized

557
00:28:59,879 --> 00:29:02,281
we were the last thing
they'd ever see.

558
00:29:02,317 --> 00:29:03,945
That has nothing to do with me!

559
00:29:03,986 --> 00:29:05,147
You're the killer!

560
00:29:05,188 --> 00:29:07,249
Ezri?

561
00:29:07,292 --> 00:29:08,920
I think you need a vacation.

562
00:29:08,962 --> 00:29:10,590
You're talking to yourself.

563
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:13,302
I'm just thinking out loud.

564
00:29:13,337 --> 00:29:14,930
I don't know what you see
in this Ferengi.

565
00:29:14,973 --> 00:29:16,100
He's repulsive.

566
00:29:16,142 --> 00:29:18,135
Can I get you a drink
or something to eat?

567
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:19,807
No. We don't have time.
We have work to do.

568
00:29:19,848 --> 00:29:21,146
No, thanks.

569
00:29:21,184 --> 00:29:22,413
I'm not hungry, really.

570
00:29:22,453 --> 00:29:23,421
Well...

571
00:29:23,455 --> 00:29:25,618
when you are,
you know where to come.

572
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,071
How I'd love to slip
a knife between his ribs.

573
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:36,738
I have a better idea...
let's get back to work.

574
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:38,509
The sooner we find our killer

575
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:40,883
the sooner you and I
can part company.

576
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,890
I thought we were
having fun together.

577
00:29:42,924 --> 00:29:44,392
Think again.

578
00:29:44,426 --> 00:29:46,555
I suppose I'll have to
make myself more endearing.

579
00:29:46,597 --> 00:29:48,794
Now, I suggest we visit
the victims' quarters

580
00:29:48,834 --> 00:29:51,659
to see what answers
we can find there.

581
00:29:51,793 --> 00:29:53,625
What are we looking for?

582
00:29:53,663 --> 00:29:55,029
Clues. What else?

583
00:29:55,065 --> 00:29:56,158
But we don't even know

584
00:29:56,201 --> 00:29:58,033
if the killer
ever set foot in here.

585
00:29:58,071 --> 00:29:59,232
Both victims were
in their quarters

586
00:29:59,273 --> 00:30:00,241
when they were killed.

587
00:30:00,274 --> 00:30:02,244
Is that a coincidence
or a connection?

588
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:03,576
I don't know.

589
00:30:03,614 --> 00:30:04,741
Think about it.

590
00:30:04,816 --> 00:30:06,478
Look around...

591
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:10,788
and remember, whatever you
see is what the killer saw.

592
00:30:20,812 --> 00:30:22,440
What do we know
about these classmates

593
00:30:22,481 --> 00:30:23,779
of Ilario's?

594
00:30:23,817 --> 00:30:25,787
Odo checked
with Starfleet Command.

595
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:30,690
The one on the left was killed
in combat five weeks ago.

596
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:33,792
The one in the middle
is stationed on the USS <i>Truman.</i>

597
00:30:33,835 --> 00:30:35,064
The <i>Truman</i> hasn't come

598
00:30:35,104 --> 00:30:37,165
anywhere near Deep Space 9
in months.

599
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:39,178
Hmm... pity.

600
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,182
Keep looking.

601
00:30:51,801 --> 00:30:55,467
Greta was quite a pack rat,
wasn't she?

602
00:30:55,508 --> 00:30:57,637
She was here a long time.

603
00:30:57,678 --> 00:30:59,773
This was home.

604
00:30:59,815 --> 00:31:02,581
A monument to bad taste.

605
00:31:03,822 --> 00:31:05,450
Just an observation.

606
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:23,917
Vanderweg's husband

607
00:31:23,958 --> 00:31:26,190
is a micropaleontologist
on Mora V.

608
00:31:27,698 --> 00:31:28,825
She was married.

609
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:30,426
Ilario was single.

610
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,998
She was on Deep Space 9
for three years.

611
00:31:33,042 --> 00:31:34,135
He just got here.

612
00:31:34,177 --> 00:31:35,668
She was a mature woman.

613
00:31:35,713 --> 00:31:37,409
He was practically a kid.

614
00:31:38,551 --> 00:31:39,712
Besides the uniform

615
00:31:39,754 --> 00:31:42,247
they have
absolutely nothing in common...

616
00:31:42,292 --> 00:31:46,664
which means they could've
just been chosen at random...

617
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,332
and if that's the case,
then we're wasting our time.

618
00:31:56,785 --> 00:31:59,255
You're thinking of giving up,
aren't you?

619
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:00,257
I didn't say that.

620
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,189
You don't have to.

621
00:32:01,225 --> 00:32:03,195
You have failure
written all over you.

622
00:32:03,229 --> 00:32:04,561
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

623
00:32:04,598 --> 00:32:06,625
It's not the lack of
clues that's keeping you

624
00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:08,262
from finding the killer...
it's you.

625
00:32:08,305 --> 00:32:09,671
Me?

626
00:32:09,708 --> 00:32:11,006
You're holding back, Ezri.

627
00:32:11,043 --> 00:32:13,605
You refuse to see with his eyes

628
00:32:13,648 --> 00:32:17,143
feel with his hands,
think with his mind.

629
00:32:17,188 --> 00:32:18,816
You want to turn me
into a killer

630
00:32:18,857 --> 00:32:20,257
make me like you.

631
00:32:20,293 --> 00:32:22,286
You are me.

632
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,662
You want me to kill someone?

633
00:32:23,699 --> 00:32:25,292
What do you say I start
with you?

634
00:32:25,335 --> 00:32:26,633
That's the spirit.

635
00:32:26,671 --> 00:32:27,969
Hold it!

636
00:32:28,008 --> 00:32:30,604
Stop him!

637
00:32:30,645 --> 00:32:31,908
They found him.

638
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,575
Stop that man!

639
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:43,699
A weapon! Over there!

640
00:32:47,642 --> 00:32:49,372
Yes, yes, do it.

641
00:32:49,413 --> 00:32:50,711
Do it!

642
00:32:52,618 --> 00:32:53,813
That's enough!

643
00:33:01,968 --> 00:33:03,402
You mind explaining this?

644
00:33:03,438 --> 00:33:05,635
I'm told that if Odo
hadn't stopped you

645
00:33:05,675 --> 00:33:07,577
you'd have stabbed
Ensign Bertram.

646
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:11,072
I was trying to stop him
from getting away.

647
00:33:11,118 --> 00:33:13,054
All right. He hit me,
I reacted...

648
00:33:14,491 --> 00:33:17,121
I guess I overreacted.

649
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:19,766
I'd say so.

650
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,632
He could be a little
more appreciative

651
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:22,638
don't you think?

652
00:33:22,672 --> 00:33:26,805
I'm sorry things got out of hand

653
00:33:26,847 --> 00:33:28,247
but Bertram killed two people.

654
00:33:28,282 --> 00:33:30,445
Bertram didn't kill anyone.

655
00:33:30,487 --> 00:33:32,650
Then why was
a security team chasing him?

656
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:33,680
Because a month ago

657
00:33:33,725 --> 00:33:37,027
he accessed the replicator
patterns on TR-116

658
00:33:37,065 --> 00:33:38,590
without authorization.

659
00:33:38,634 --> 00:33:40,102
Sounds guilty to me.

660
00:33:40,137 --> 00:33:43,871
Why would he replicate a rifle
unless he was going to use it?

661
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:47,144
Because he collects weapons...
Federation, Klingon, Cardassian.

662
00:33:47,183 --> 00:33:48,913
What a coincidence.

663
00:33:48,952 --> 00:33:51,047
That doesn't
rule him out as a suspect.

664
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,888
True, but the fact
that he was on Bajor

665
00:33:52,926 --> 00:33:54,656
when the first murder occurred
does.

666
00:33:57,601 --> 00:34:00,538
You've been under
a lot of stress lately, so...

667
00:34:00,574 --> 00:34:03,568
Ben, please don't give up on me.

668
00:34:03,612 --> 00:34:05,342
I can find this murderer.

669
00:34:05,382 --> 00:34:07,010
I know I can.

670
00:34:07,052 --> 00:34:09,181
I just need more time.

671
00:34:14,097 --> 00:34:15,929
I don't know what you
and Jadzia and Curzon

672
00:34:16,035 --> 00:34:17,526
all see in that man.

673
00:34:17,571 --> 00:34:20,201
He's so insufferable,
so Starfleet.

674
00:34:20,242 --> 00:34:23,236
I'm surprised the killer
hasn't targeted him.

675
00:34:23,281 --> 00:34:25,945
I'm joking, of course

676
00:34:25,986 --> 00:34:29,288
but he did come perilously close
to derailing our investigation.

677
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:32,497
And you have to take
some of the blame for that.

678
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:33,726
What did I do?

679
00:34:33,766 --> 00:34:34,961
It's what you didn't do, really.

680
00:34:35,002 --> 00:34:36,334
You should have
told him about me.

681
00:34:36,371 --> 00:34:37,600
You're kidding.

682
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,608
One word about you

683
00:34:38,642 --> 00:34:39,974
and he'd have pulled
me off the case.

684
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:41,980
Well, then, I guess I'll have
to remain your little secret

685
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:44,143
and be glad that you're
still in his good graces.

686
00:34:44,185 --> 00:34:45,744
Not that it matters, really.

687
00:34:45,788 --> 00:34:47,222
We would have continued on

688
00:34:47,258 --> 00:34:49,124
without Sisko's blessing.
Right?

689
00:34:55,005 --> 00:34:56,166
What are you doing?

690
00:34:56,207 --> 00:34:57,835
What does it look like?

691
00:34:57,876 --> 00:35:00,779
<i>I'nora, ja'kala vok...</i>

692
00:35:00,815 --> 00:35:01,612
Do you really think

693
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,141
you can get rid
of me this easily?

694
00:35:03,186 --> 00:35:05,748
<i>Zheem Dax nah</i>
<i>sass-eye-ahn...</i>

695
00:35:05,791 --> 00:35:08,785
Don't you realize
we've made Dax whole again?

696
00:35:08,829 --> 00:35:10,627
<i>D'za-oo bah-zheest...</i>

697
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:12,637
Don't back away now.

698
00:35:16,143 --> 00:35:19,377
<i>Joran rhee jehr hey-dah...</i>

699
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,985
<i>Joran rhee jehr hey-dah.</i>

700
00:35:24,023 --> 00:35:26,493
You won't catch
the killer without me.

701
00:35:26,528 --> 00:35:28,828
Odo to Lieutenant Dax.

702
00:35:28,865 --> 00:35:31,563
Report to the Habitat Ring,
on H-43.

703
00:35:33,441 --> 00:35:34,932
I'm on my way.

704
00:35:37,414 --> 00:35:40,180
Petty officer Zim Brott; Bolian.

705
00:35:40,219 --> 00:35:43,019
Five years of service
on Deep Space 9.

706
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,582
I knew him.

707
00:35:44,627 --> 00:35:47,029
Or, at least, Jadzia did.

708
00:35:47,065 --> 00:35:50,731
He has a wife and
co-husband on Bolarus.

709
00:35:50,772 --> 00:35:52,035
Well, so much for the theory

710
00:35:52,074 --> 00:35:53,770
that our killer
only targets humans.

711
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,005
Captain...

712
00:35:55,046 --> 00:35:56,605
The bullet pierced his heart?

713
00:35:58,185 --> 00:35:59,346
At close range.

714
00:35:59,388 --> 00:36:01,220
Why am I not surprised?

715
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:08,998
What if we don't catch him?

716
00:36:09,104 --> 00:36:10,732
Will he keep shooting
Starfleet officers

717
00:36:10,775 --> 00:36:12,471
till there are none
left on the station?

718
00:36:12,511 --> 00:36:14,640
How could anyone be so happy

719
00:36:14,681 --> 00:36:17,151
with such unattractive
children?

720
00:36:17,186 --> 00:36:18,882
What did you say?

721
00:36:18,922 --> 00:36:22,156
This photo.

722
00:36:26,669 --> 00:36:28,399
That's it.

723
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,772
It's the pictures.

724
00:36:30,944 --> 00:36:32,606
He's laughing.

725
00:36:32,647 --> 00:36:34,445
She's laughing.

726
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,681
That's what the victims
have in common...

727
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,211
pictures of laughing faces.

728
00:36:38,257 --> 00:36:40,055
A killer who hates laughter

729
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,856
who hates emotion.

730
00:36:43,233 --> 00:36:44,963
A Vulcan.

731
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:46,265
All Vulcans distrust emotions

732
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:48,673
but they don't go around
killing people for smiling.

733
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:50,679
This one does.

734
00:36:50,713 --> 00:36:53,081
Something happened to him.

735
00:36:53,151 --> 00:36:55,587
Something so
emotionally painful

736
00:36:55,621 --> 00:36:57,853
it's making him lose control.

737
00:36:57,892 --> 00:37:00,729
When he looks through
the targeting sensor

738
00:37:00,863 --> 00:37:03,834
and sees those pictures,
the laughter seems to mock him.

739
00:37:03,868 --> 00:37:05,564
You're thinking like he thinks.

740
00:37:05,604 --> 00:37:06,469
Good, Ezri.

741
00:37:07,909 --> 00:37:10,038
Computer, how many
Vulcan Starfleet officers

742
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,047
are on the station?

743
00:37:11,081 --> 00:37:14,611
There are 48 Vulcans
serving on Deep Space 9.

744
00:37:14,655 --> 00:37:17,558
Now all we have to do
is eliminate 47 of them.

745
00:37:17,593 --> 00:37:19,459
I should tell Odo.

746
00:37:19,497 --> 00:37:21,125
Not until we have proof.

747
00:37:21,166 --> 00:37:22,657
Then let's get some.

748
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:31,082
We still have 28 suspects...

749
00:37:31,117 --> 00:37:33,349
Vulcans who have suffered
a personal loss of some kind.

750
00:37:33,388 --> 00:37:34,617
We've narrowed the field.

751
00:37:34,657 --> 00:37:36,421
Not by enough.

752
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:51,542
There's one thing
I don't understand...

753
00:37:51,587 --> 00:37:52,646
if he hates laughter

754
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:54,852
then why doesn't he
seek out his victims

755
00:37:54,894 --> 00:37:56,522
in Quark's or the holosuite?

756
00:37:56,563 --> 00:37:58,429
Maybe it's not
just the laughter.

757
00:37:58,467 --> 00:38:00,403
You're right.

758
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,134
Maybe it has something to do

759
00:38:03,174 --> 00:38:06,168
with... the way the photograph
freezes the emotion

760
00:38:06,214 --> 00:38:10,153
making it seem like the laughter
is going to last forever.

761
00:38:18,703 --> 00:38:20,866
Level 12, Central Core.

762
00:38:20,907 --> 00:38:24,209
So, what do we do now?

763
00:38:24,246 --> 00:38:26,546
We go back over
our list of suspects

764
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:28,576
see if we can't narrow it down.

765
00:38:28,621 --> 00:38:31,752
Then, proof or no proof,
we give the list to Odo.

766
00:38:38,204 --> 00:38:41,370
Habitat Ring, Level K-55.

767
00:38:46,052 --> 00:38:47,782
What are you doing?

768
00:38:49,024 --> 00:38:50,788
Are you addressing me?

769
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,855
Sorry.

770
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:54,126
Never mind.

771
00:38:55,168 --> 00:38:56,636
It's him, Ezri.

772
00:38:56,671 --> 00:38:58,105
I know it is.

773
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,836
We've found our killer.

774
00:39:08,626 --> 00:39:09,389
I'm telling you

775
00:39:09,427 --> 00:39:10,690
he's the one
we're looking for.

776
00:39:10,729 --> 00:39:12,254
Look in his eyes.

777
00:39:15,671 --> 00:39:18,301
By the way, I'm Counselor Dax.

778
00:39:19,478 --> 00:39:20,639
I know.

779
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,354
What are you doing?

780
00:39:25,389 --> 00:39:26,516
He's getting away.

781
00:39:26,558 --> 00:39:27,821
We need proof...

782
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,385
something I can take to Odo.

783
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,728
And while you're
looking for that proof

784
00:39:30,765 --> 00:39:31,960
what do you think
the Vulcan will be doing?

785
00:39:32,001 --> 00:39:32,969
Let me tell you.

786
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,996
He's going to pick
another victim.

787
00:39:37,745 --> 00:39:40,409
Science Officer Chu'lak, age 97

788
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:42,180
assigned to Deep Space 9
three months ago.

789
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,315
Before that, he served
aboard the USS <i>Grissom.</i>

790
00:39:44,356 --> 00:39:45,551
Why was he transferred?

791
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:48,188
The <i>Grissom</i> was destroyed
by the Jem'Hadar

792
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,223
in the battle of Ricktor Prime.

793
00:39:50,267 --> 00:39:52,430
He was one of only
six crewmen to survive.

794
00:39:52,472 --> 00:39:55,034
Six survivors
out of a crew of 1,250.

795
00:39:56,045 --> 00:39:58,641
He served on that
ship for ten years.

796
00:39:58,683 --> 00:39:59,946
Those people who were killed

797
00:39:59,985 --> 00:40:01,578
were his colleagues...
his friends.

798
00:40:01,621 --> 00:40:03,180
That's a painful loss,
even for a Vulcan.

799
00:40:03,224 --> 00:40:05,022
That doesn't
make him a killer.

800
00:40:05,061 --> 00:40:06,859
But your instincts
tell you that he is.

801
00:40:06,897 --> 00:40:08,297
Listen to your instincts.

802
00:40:08,334 --> 00:40:09,666
Listen to me.

803
00:40:09,703 --> 00:40:10,762
It's him.

804
00:40:10,805 --> 00:40:14,767
Computer, locate
Science Officer Chu'lak.

805
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:17,044
Lieutenant Chu'lak
is in his quarters.

806
00:40:17,116 --> 00:40:19,052
Seeking out his next victim.

807
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:21,784
Computer, where are
Chu'lak's quarters?

808
00:40:21,824 --> 00:40:24,920
Habitat Ring, Level D-12.

809
00:40:31,108 --> 00:40:32,076
My thought, exactly.

810
00:40:44,464 --> 00:40:45,796
What do you see?

811
00:40:55,785 --> 00:40:58,312
He's studying something
on his computer console.

812
00:40:58,357 --> 00:40:59,791
Studying what?

813
00:41:07,406 --> 00:41:08,396
What is it?

814
00:41:08,442 --> 00:41:09,410
Me.

815
00:41:09,443 --> 00:41:11,436
My service record.

816
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,846
He knows we suspect him.

817
00:41:15,287 --> 00:41:16,880
He's going into the next room.

818
00:41:16,923 --> 00:41:18,016
What's he doing?

819
00:41:19,762 --> 00:41:21,560
He's coming back.

820
00:41:21,598 --> 00:41:22,531
He's carrying something.

821
00:41:22,567 --> 00:41:24,195
It's a rifle, isn't it?

822
00:41:24,236 --> 00:41:25,363
Isn't it?

823
00:41:27,542 --> 00:41:29,340
Yes.

824
00:41:30,381 --> 00:41:31,371
Shoot him.

825
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:42,034
Don't think about it.

826
00:41:42,068 --> 00:41:43,229
Just do it.

827
00:41:44,306 --> 00:41:46,242
Kill him.

828
00:41:57,095 --> 00:41:58,188
Oh.

829
00:41:59,734 --> 00:42:01,464
Congratulations.

830
00:42:06,612 --> 00:42:08,080
I'm proud of you.

831
00:42:25,813 --> 00:42:26,872
Go ahead.

832
00:42:26,915 --> 00:42:28,315
Finish what you started.

833
00:42:31,023 --> 00:42:33,493
Tell me, why did you do it?

834
00:42:33,528 --> 00:42:37,297
Because logic demanded it.

835
00:42:38,302 --> 00:42:40,066
What are you waiting for?

836
00:42:40,106 --> 00:42:41,870
He deserves to die.

837
00:42:41,909 --> 00:42:43,172
You know that.

838
00:42:43,245 --> 00:42:46,740
Follow your instincts.

839
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,093
Dax to Infirmary.

840
00:42:56,135 --> 00:42:58,196
I need
an emergency medical team

841
00:42:58,238 --> 00:43:00,002
Habitat Ring, D-12.

842
00:43:00,042 --> 00:43:01,374
On our way.

843
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:06,679
Try not to look
so disappointed.

844
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:14,293

or bury me as deeply
as Curzon and Jadzia did.

855
00:43:45,524 --> 00:43:46,492
I know.

856
00:43:46,526 --> 00:43:47,858
I'm part of you now.

857
00:43:47,895 --> 00:43:51,163
As much as Audrid,
