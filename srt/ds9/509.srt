1
00:00:02,464 --> 00:00:04,161
Don't you think you
might be overpacking?

2
00:00:04,202 --> 00:00:05,501
It'll close.

3
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:07,007
You don't have to take
everything at once.

4
00:00:07,042 --> 00:00:08,409
It's not like you're
moving to Bajor.

5
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:10,609
1-G-12 is practically
right next door.

6
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:13,020
I know, but I'm not moving
to 1-G-12.

7
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,355
Huh?

8
00:00:14,393 --> 00:00:16,364
I found some great quarters
over in Section M.

9
00:00:16,398 --> 00:00:17,492
That's all the way

10
00:00:17,534 --> 00:00:18,969
on the other side
of the Habitat Ring.

11
00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:20,907
Dad, don't get all
sentimental on me.

12
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:22,844
Wait till your son
moves out on you.

13
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,851
I don't have a son.

14
00:00:24,885 --> 00:00:26,479
Ha!

15
00:00:26,522 --> 00:00:27,650
Hoo-hoo!

16
00:00:27,692 --> 00:00:29,720
Go ahead, Jake.
Make jokes.

17
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,734
One day, you'll be
standing where I am

18
00:00:31,767 --> 00:00:33,498
and believe me,
you won't like it

19
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:34,769
any more than I do.

20
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:37,338
Yeah, maybe, but right now,
I'm standing here

21
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:39,409
and I can't wait
to spend my first night

22
00:00:39,453 --> 00:00:40,421
in my own place.

23
00:00:40,456 --> 00:00:42,950
See?
I told you it'd close.

24
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,263
Now, wait, wait.

25
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,268
Let me get this straight.

26
00:00:46,303 --> 00:00:47,829
I can visit any time I want

27
00:00:47,873 --> 00:00:49,274
but I have to call first.

28
00:00:49,377 --> 00:00:50,812
You're not available
for breakfast or lunch

29
00:00:50,847 --> 00:00:53,114
but I can count
on one dinner a week.

30
00:00:53,152 --> 00:00:55,453
Yeah, well, some weeks,
maybe even two.

31
00:00:55,492 --> 00:00:58,693
Oh. I have raised
a very generous son.

32
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:05,172
You and Nog moving in together.

33
00:01:05,214 --> 00:01:07,242
I can remember
when I didn't even want you

34
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:08,252
talking to him.

35
00:01:08,322 --> 00:01:09,814
Yeah, well, things change.

36
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:11,089
They sure do.

37
00:01:30,876 --> 00:01:32,004
Come in.

38
00:01:34,953 --> 00:01:36,890
Oh, it's you?

39
00:01:36,924 --> 00:01:38,154
Who'd you think it was?

40
00:01:38,193 --> 00:01:39,161
Nog.

41
00:01:39,196 --> 00:01:40,495
How could it be Nog?

42
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:42,595
His ship hasn't even docked yet.

43
00:01:42,637 --> 00:01:44,471
I guess I wasn't thinking.

44
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:45,534
What else is new?

45
00:01:45,578 --> 00:01:47,241
Can I help it if I'm excited?

46
00:01:47,282 --> 00:01:48,615
My son is coming home.

47
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:50,748
Root beer?

48
00:01:52,461 --> 00:01:54,295
His favorite.

49
00:01:54,332 --> 00:01:56,964
I don't know
how to thank you, Brother.

50
00:01:57,006 --> 00:01:59,341
Ten slips of latinum
ought to do it.

51
00:01:59,378 --> 00:02:02,249
Do you think he'd mind
if I had one for myself?

52
00:02:02,285 --> 00:02:03,275
I'd mind.

53
00:02:07,898 --> 00:02:11,099
My own brother
drinking root beer.

54
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:13,907
It's so... hu-man.

55
00:02:13,946 --> 00:02:17,010
Mmm... and bubbly.

56
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,522
That's him.
That's him.

57
00:02:20,562 --> 00:02:22,293
Come in.

58
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,632
Wrong again.

59
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:24,933
Constable.

60
00:02:26,876 --> 00:02:28,368
Care for a root beer?

61
00:02:28,413 --> 00:02:31,113
No, but you have something
I do want.

62
00:02:31,153 --> 00:02:32,782
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

63
00:02:32,825 --> 00:02:34,351
Don't tell me.

64
00:02:34,395 --> 00:02:37,391
Tell the Federation Grand Jury
on Inferna Prime.

65
00:02:37,435 --> 00:02:38,927
Federation Grand Jury?

66
00:02:38,972 --> 00:02:40,305
Brother, what have you done now?

67
00:02:40,342 --> 00:02:41,401
I haven't done anything.

68
00:02:41,512 --> 00:02:42,981
What do they want
to talk to me for?

69
00:02:43,016 --> 00:02:44,645
Oh, I think you know.

70
00:02:44,686 --> 00:02:48,822
Odo, I have no idea
what this is all about.

71
00:02:48,863 --> 00:02:50,800
Well, then,
you'll have eight days

72
00:02:50,834 --> 00:02:52,133
to try and guess.

73
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,663
We leave immediately.

74
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:54,767
"We"?

75
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:55,869
I've been waiting

76
00:02:55,913 --> 00:02:57,975
ten years for you
to get what you deserve.

77
00:02:58,018 --> 00:03:00,012
Now that the big moment
is finally here

78
00:03:00,057 --> 00:03:02,119
I wouldn't miss it for anything.

79
00:03:02,162 --> 00:03:03,187
Let's go.

80
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,198
Brother!

81
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:05,201
What?

82
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:07,969
I'll say "Hi" to Nog for you.

83
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:09,273
Yeah.

84
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:22,695
So, how much longer
till we reach Inferna Prime?

85
00:05:23,705 --> 00:05:27,510
Oh, I'd say 191 hours
and 17 minutes

86
00:05:27,614 --> 00:05:29,482
give or take a day.

87
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,250
In that case,
we better find something

88
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,257
to occupy our time.

89
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:35,197
Care for a game of fizzbin?

90
00:05:35,232 --> 00:05:37,294
I don't play cards.

91
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,305
I'll teach you.

92
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:39,364
It's a very simple game.

93
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:41,880
Let me put it another way.

94
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:44,079
I don't want to play cards

95
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,218
and even if I did, I wouldn't
want to play with you.

96
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,456
Afraid you'd lose?

97
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,366
You know, Odo, I used to think
all your problems

98
00:05:52,407 --> 00:05:54,469
stemmed from the fact
that you were a changeling.

99
00:05:54,512 --> 00:05:56,676
Isolated from your own kind

100
00:05:56,717 --> 00:05:59,690
forced to live among strangers
who didn't understand you.

101
00:05:59,724 --> 00:06:02,288
You couldn't eat,
you couldn't drink

102
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:05,635
you couldn't sleep,
you couldn't make love.

103
00:06:05,671 --> 00:06:09,305
Was it any wonder
you had such a bad disposition?

104
00:06:09,347 --> 00:06:11,078
But you're not
a changeling anymore.

105
00:06:11,118 --> 00:06:12,553
You're one of us.

106
00:06:12,588 --> 00:06:14,525
Life is yours for the taking.

107
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,533
All you have to do
is reach out and grab it.

108
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,064
But do you?

109
00:06:21,109 --> 00:06:22,806
No.

110
00:06:22,846 --> 00:06:28,884
Because solid or changeling,
you're still a miserable

111
00:06:28,928 --> 00:06:30,557
self-hating misanthrope.

112
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:35,872
That's who you are,
and that's who you'll always be.

113
00:06:37,782 --> 00:06:40,584
I'm still not playing cards
with you.

114
00:06:40,622 --> 00:06:44,997
Fine. Then we'll just sit here
for a week in silence.

115
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,435
What are you reading?

116
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:50,809
Nothing that would interest you.

117
00:06:50,846 --> 00:06:51,814
Don't be so sure.

118
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:52,977
Quark, give me that.

119
00:06:53,018 --> 00:06:54,818
What are you going to do,
arrest me?

120
00:06:55,925 --> 00:07:00,561
"He walked towards her,
the wooden deck

121
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:04,602
"heaving to and fro
beneath his booted feet.

122
00:07:04,713 --> 00:07:08,051
"Her hands moved
to the brooch at her throat.

123
00:07:08,087 --> 00:07:12,029
"She unclasped it,
and the cloak fell

124
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,590
"from her shoulders

125
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:18,043
"her wet skin glistening
in the moonlight.

126
00:07:18,078 --> 00:07:23,045
"Lightning flashed
and heaven's thunder roared

127
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,288
in rhythm with the
beating of their hearts."

128
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:26,297
All right, enough.

129
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:27,321
Odo, I take it all back.

130
00:07:27,367 --> 00:07:28,335
You're obviously

131
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,238
a lot more complicated
than I thought.

132
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:32,873
If you like that kind of thing

133
00:07:32,914 --> 00:07:35,010
I might be interested
in selling you

134
00:07:35,052 --> 00:07:37,319
my first edition
of <i>Vulcan Love Slave.</i>

135
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,692
This is work, not recreation.

136
00:07:39,764 --> 00:07:41,324
Books like this

137
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:43,361
give me an insight
into the criminal mind.

138
00:07:43,406 --> 00:07:44,932
It is a well-known fact

139
00:07:44,976 --> 00:07:47,972
that a high percentage
of homicides

140
00:07:48,016 --> 00:07:52,186
are motivated
by romantic obsession.

141
00:07:52,227 --> 00:07:54,562
Well, no one gets killed
in <i>Vulcan Love Slave</i>

142
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,473
but it's still a hell of a read.

143
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:02,416
Oh, give it up, Quark.

144
00:08:02,451 --> 00:08:06,894
You can annoy me, bait me,
question my very existence

145
00:08:06,929 --> 00:08:09,959
but in the end,
we both know I've won.

146
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:11,336
Because when all
is said and done

147
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:13,810
I'll be heading back
to Deep Space 9

148
00:08:13,845 --> 00:08:16,078
and you'll be spending
the rest of your life

149
00:08:16,118 --> 00:08:18,487
in a Federation penal colony.

150
00:08:18,523 --> 00:08:20,494
I'm not there yet.

151
00:08:20,528 --> 00:08:22,088
Mm-hmm.

152
00:08:22,132 --> 00:08:24,535
Look, Odo, give me a chance.

153
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,474
At least, tell me
what the charges are.

154
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:27,705
I'm afraid I can't do that.

155
00:08:27,745 --> 00:08:29,476
This is a high-security
investigation.

156
00:08:29,516 --> 00:08:32,979
I'm not allowed to discuss
the specifics with anyone.

157
00:08:33,024 --> 00:08:34,323
Now...

158
00:08:34,361 --> 00:08:35,830
if you'll excuse me...

159
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,807
I have some reading to do.

160
00:08:54,944 --> 00:08:57,177
Cadet Nog,
reporting for duty, sir.

161
00:08:57,216 --> 00:08:59,278
At ease, Cadet.

162
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:02,351
All right.

163
00:09:02,395 --> 00:09:04,423
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

164
00:09:04,466 --> 00:09:06,937
I remember my sophomore year.

165
00:09:06,973 --> 00:09:09,946
Field studies, Starbase 137.

166
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,112
When I first got there,
I was a little apprehensive...

167
00:09:14,825 --> 00:09:16,921
but it turned out to be
one of the best experiences

168
00:09:16,963 --> 00:09:18,125
of my life.

169
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,134
Yes, sir.

170
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:20,570
Well.

171
00:09:20,605 --> 00:09:23,737
Now, the key to field study
is simple.

172
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:25,807
Keep your eyes and ears open,
follow orders

173
00:09:25,884 --> 00:09:28,151
and try not to get in the way.

174
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,161
Yes, sir.
Very good, sir.

175
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,664
I won't let you down.

176
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:36,343
I'd like to say,
on a personal note

177
00:09:36,377 --> 00:09:39,977
I'm glad you and Jake
are going to be roommates.

178
00:09:40,018 --> 00:09:41,008
Yes, sir.

179
00:09:41,054 --> 00:09:45,292
I'm sure the two of you
are going to have, uh...

180
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:47,325
a lot of fun together.

181
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:48,668
Yes, sir.

182
00:09:48,706 --> 00:09:50,107
Time permitting, sir.

183
00:09:50,143 --> 00:09:51,373
I mean, if I'm not too busy.

184
00:09:51,413 --> 00:09:53,977
After all, I am here to work.

185
00:09:54,018 --> 00:09:55,453
Don't worry, sir.

186
00:09:55,489 --> 00:09:56,753
I'll look after him for you.

187
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:58,318
Set a good example.

188
00:09:58,363 --> 00:10:00,995
Keep him out of trouble.

189
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:04,498
You inspire me
with confidence, Cadet.

190
00:10:09,122 --> 00:10:10,021
Dismissed.

191
00:10:15,971 --> 00:10:17,440
How'd it go?

192
00:10:17,475 --> 00:10:19,469
I inspire him.

193
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:22,175
Congratulations.

194
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,883
Now don't let him down.

195
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,324
You can count on me, sir.

196
00:10:31,842 --> 00:10:33,972
Lights!

197
00:10:36,654 --> 00:10:38,682
So, what do you think?

198
00:10:38,726 --> 00:10:41,324
I think I've died
and gone to the Divine Treasury.

199
00:10:41,366 --> 00:10:42,892
After living
in cadet barracks

200
00:10:42,936 --> 00:10:45,500
for the past year,
this is going to be paradise.

201
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:48,013
Yeah, I know what you mean.

202
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:49,709
We're on our own now.

203
00:10:49,752 --> 00:10:51,882
No one to tell us what to do.

204
00:10:51,924 --> 00:10:54,361
Well, before we unpack

205
00:10:54,397 --> 00:10:56,128
we should call maintenance
to clean this place.

206
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:57,659
They were here yesterday.

207
00:10:57,704 --> 00:10:59,732
Well, if you want
something done right

208
00:10:59,776 --> 00:11:01,075
you have to do it yourself.

209
00:11:01,112 --> 00:11:02,411
I'll do the clean on
the odd-numbered days.

210
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:04,043
And you'll do it
on the even ones.

211
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,093
We're going to clean every day?

212
00:11:07,127 --> 00:11:10,157
No, just the odd and even ones.

213
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:13,174
Look, I'd better start
bringing in my things.

214
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,541
I don't want to be up
too late unpacking.

215
00:11:14,578 --> 00:11:15,672
So what do you want
to do tonight?

216
00:11:15,715 --> 00:11:17,845
Dom-jot? Holosuites?

217
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,484
I wish I could,
but once we eat and unpack

218
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:21,926
it'll be time for bed.

219
00:11:21,962 --> 00:11:23,397
Lights out at 2200.

220
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,030
I haven't gone to bed that early
since I was 12.

221
00:11:26,072 --> 00:11:28,943
Go to sleep whenever you want,
but don't forget

222
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,710
we're hitting the gym at 0430.

223
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:31,981
The gym?

224
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,785
Muscles, Jake.

225
00:11:33,824 --> 00:11:35,727
You know, those things
that are supposed to go

226
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:37,062
between your bones
and your skin?

227
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,000
Yeah, I've heard of them.

228
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:40,506
Good. 'Cause by the time
I'm done with you

229
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,770
you'll have some
of your very own.

230
00:12:16,345 --> 00:12:18,646
You're doing it again.

231
00:12:20,255 --> 00:12:21,656
Doing what?

232
00:12:21,691 --> 00:12:23,594
Smacking your lips.

233
00:12:24,732 --> 00:12:26,133
No, I'm not.

234
00:12:31,147 --> 00:12:32,878
There.
Don't you hear that?

235
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,286
The only thing

236
00:12:34,322 --> 00:12:35,757
I've heard
for the past four days

237
00:12:35,792 --> 00:12:38,195
is you complaining.

238
00:12:38,231 --> 00:12:43,335
This whole runabout is alive
with annoying little noises.

239
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:46,211
Listen.

240
00:12:47,687 --> 00:12:48,746
To what?

241
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,316
That buzzing noise.

242
00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:53,932
I don't hear a thing.

243
00:12:54,002 --> 00:12:55,596
It started over an hour ago.

244
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,439
If you don't like the noises
in here

245
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:58,946
why don't you go into the back?

246
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:02,077
Because it's even colder
back there than it is up here.

247
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,133
Quark, leave the
temperature controls alone.

248
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,833
I will, when I get it right.

249
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:14,849
There it is again.

250
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,920
What?

251
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,928
That buzzing noise.

252
00:13:18,962 --> 00:13:20,261
Don't you hear it?

253
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,327
With all this lip smacking

254
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,432
how could I hear anything?

255
00:13:24,475 --> 00:13:26,571
Where's it coming from?

256
00:13:26,614 --> 00:13:28,083
Inside your head.

257
00:13:28,117 --> 00:13:30,179
Shh!

258
00:13:30,223 --> 00:13:31,590
Bzzz...

259
00:13:31,626 --> 00:13:32,993
I said be quiet!

260
00:13:35,803 --> 00:13:37,671
It's coming from here.

261
00:13:37,707 --> 00:13:41,546
It's probably
a defective anodyne circuit.

262
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:45,388
Defective anodyne circuits
make a hissing sound.

263
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:46,894
This is a buzz.

264
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:49,561
We'd better open up this hatch.

265
00:13:49,602 --> 00:13:51,732
If this is some sort
of convoluted plot

266
00:13:51,774 --> 00:13:52,742
to escape...

267
00:13:52,776 --> 00:13:54,747
Stop being so suspicious.

268
00:13:55,951 --> 00:13:57,751
That's odd.

269
00:13:57,788 --> 00:14:00,522
The buzzing's changed pitch.

270
00:14:00,561 --> 00:14:02,361
It's gotten louder, too.

271
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,869
I can hear it now.

272
00:14:03,903 --> 00:14:04,962
What could it be?

273
00:14:05,072 --> 00:14:07,270
Let's find out.

274
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:12,184
Don't tell me.

275
00:14:12,222 --> 00:14:13,212
Let me guess.

276
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:19,434
It's a bomb.

277
00:14:29,565 --> 00:14:31,433
Next time I tell you

278
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:34,271
I hear something,
maybe you'll listen.

279
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:36,337
Let's hope there
is a next time.

280
00:14:36,381 --> 00:14:37,782
I'm going to get
a transporter lock

281
00:14:37,817 --> 00:14:39,377
on this thing
and beam it out of here.

282
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:40,651
What if it's set to go off

283
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:42,662
if someone tries
to transport it?

284
00:14:42,696 --> 00:14:44,724
What do you suggest,
we wait for it to explode?

285
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:46,067
Fine.

286
00:14:46,171 --> 00:14:47,333
Beam it out

287
00:14:47,374 --> 00:14:49,368
but at least try
and channel the explosion

288
00:14:49,412 --> 00:14:50,881
through the
transporter buffer.

289
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,650
I hope this works.

290
00:15:02,176 --> 00:15:03,611
We did it!

291
00:15:03,646 --> 00:15:05,013
We're safe.

292
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:10,460
I wouldn't be
so sure about that!

293
00:15:10,496 --> 00:15:13,298
Com system's down.

294
00:15:13,336 --> 00:15:15,569
Navigational array's failing.

295
00:15:15,608 --> 00:15:17,670
Environmental controls
are badly damaged.

296
00:15:17,713 --> 00:15:19,946
Oh. We're losing atmosphere.

297
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:21,044
What now?

298
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,648
Now we find someplace to land.

299
00:15:22,692 --> 00:15:24,025
Land?
You mean crash.

300
00:15:24,062 --> 00:15:25,087
It's either that

301
00:15:25,164 --> 00:15:27,966
or wait for our lungs to explode
in the vacuum of space.

302
00:15:28,004 --> 00:15:29,838
Ah! I'm picking up
a Class-L planet

303
00:15:29,876 --> 00:15:31,106
on long-range scanners.

304
00:15:31,145 --> 00:15:32,113
Barely habitable.

305
00:15:32,214 --> 00:15:34,014
More habitable than this thing's
going to be

306
00:15:34,052 --> 00:15:35,020
in a few minutes.

307
00:15:35,054 --> 00:15:36,785
How close?
Close enough...

308
00:15:36,826 --> 00:15:38,022
I hope.

309
00:15:44,912 --> 00:15:46,677
If we live through this

310
00:15:46,716 --> 00:15:48,880
whoever planted that bomb
is going to regret it.

311
00:15:48,922 --> 00:15:49,981
Believe me, you don't want

312
00:15:50,024 --> 00:15:51,824
to get anywhere near
the Orion Syndicate.

313
00:15:51,862 --> 00:15:53,161
The Orion Syndicate?

314
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:56,502
Is that who the Grand Jury's
investigating?

315
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:57,974
I thought you knew.

316
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:00,378
If I knew you were involved
in the Orion Syndicate

317
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,319
you'd be on the <i>Defiant</i>
right now

318
00:16:02,353 --> 00:16:04,221
surrounded by half my deputies.

319
00:16:07,398 --> 00:16:08,890
Let me guess.

320
00:16:08,936 --> 00:16:10,804
You pretended to know
more than you did

321
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,070
so I'd think
I had nothing to hide

322
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,841
and say something
to incriminate myself.

323
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:15,681
Something like that.

324
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:17,086
This is all your fault.

325
00:16:17,122 --> 00:16:19,686
You're the one who's a member
of the Orion Syndicate.

326
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:20,788
I'm not a member.

327
00:16:20,831 --> 00:16:22,357
I just know people
who know people

328
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:24,770
who know some other people,
and besides...

329
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,141
Someone adjust the temperature.

330
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,083
It's freezing in here.

331
00:16:43,117 --> 00:16:44,416
Actually...

332
00:16:44,454 --> 00:16:46,857
it's freezing out there.

333
00:16:46,894 --> 00:16:49,331
Out there?

334
00:16:49,366 --> 00:16:52,670
Uh... yeah.

335
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,177
Now I remember.

336
00:16:54,211 --> 00:16:55,771
You were apologizing

337
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:58,116
for almost getting
us both killed.

338
00:16:58,153 --> 00:17:00,647
Huh! If that's
how you remember it

339
00:17:00,693 --> 00:17:04,464
you must've hit your head
harder than I thought you did.

340
00:17:04,502 --> 00:17:07,202
I guess there's
nothing we can do now

341
00:17:07,275 --> 00:17:10,112
except send out
a distress signal

342
00:17:10,149 --> 00:17:11,584
and wait to be rescued.

343
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:15,321
Good plan, except we lost the
com system in the explosion.

344
00:17:15,361 --> 00:17:16,557
That's not good.

345
00:17:16,598 --> 00:17:18,067
Gets worse.

346
00:17:18,101 --> 00:17:19,866
The replicator's been destroyed.

347
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:22,879
From what I can tell,
the local plants are poisonous.

348
00:17:22,913 --> 00:17:25,384
Then I guess
we're stuck with field rations.

349
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,757
That's right...
one package for you

350
00:17:28,794 --> 00:17:30,525
one package for me.

351
00:17:30,565 --> 00:17:31,864
The rest...

352
00:17:31,902 --> 00:17:33,269
I know, I know.

353
00:17:33,305 --> 00:17:36,039
Destroyed in the explosion.

354
00:17:36,077 --> 00:17:37,706
So now what?

355
00:17:37,749 --> 00:17:41,622
Now we either freeze to death
or starve to death.

356
00:17:41,658 --> 00:17:43,993
Take your pick.

357
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,273
It's about time you woke up.

358
00:17:51,315 --> 00:17:54,311
I thought you were
going to sleep all day.

359
00:17:54,388 --> 00:17:57,520
You should stretch a little
before you start your workout.

360
00:17:57,562 --> 00:18:00,194
I think I'll pass
this morning.

361
00:18:00,236 --> 00:18:01,865
You pass every morning.

362
00:18:01,907 --> 00:18:03,878
You can work out
for the both of us.

363
00:18:03,911 --> 00:18:05,848
You don't know
what you're missing.

364
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:07,717
A healthy body, a healthy mind.

365
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,886
Please, Nog, no clichés
before breakfast.

366
00:18:10,928 --> 00:18:14,391
Orange juice, extra large.

367
00:18:14,436 --> 00:18:17,899
A healthy way
to start the day.

368
00:18:17,945 --> 00:18:20,348
A writer and a poet.

369
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,919
What's this?

370
00:18:22,957 --> 00:18:24,483
"Past Prologue."

371
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:26,019
What's it doing here?

372
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,262
I found it while
I was cleaning up.

373
00:18:28,303 --> 00:18:30,969
Really, Jake, is it that hard
to keep this place clean?

374
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,173
You read my story?

375
00:18:33,214 --> 00:18:34,740
What'd you think?

376
00:18:34,786 --> 00:18:36,780
"Disposal" is spelled
with an "i."

377
00:18:36,823 --> 00:18:38,885
That's it?
That's all you have to say?

378
00:18:38,928 --> 00:18:41,492
I didn't really read it
for content.

379
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,938
I mostly corrected
your spelling and grammar.

380
00:18:43,974 --> 00:18:45,136
You changed my words?

381
00:18:45,177 --> 00:18:46,145
Just a few.

382
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:47,705
A preposition here

383
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,242
some punctuation there.

384
00:18:49,287 --> 00:18:50,916
You can't change
a writer's words

385
00:18:50,957 --> 00:18:52,392
without his permission.

386
00:18:52,427 --> 00:18:53,953
That's sacrilege!

387
00:18:53,998 --> 00:18:55,331
All right.

388
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,168
Next time, I'll let you
make the changes.

389
00:18:57,206 --> 00:18:58,368
There won't be a next time.

390
00:18:58,409 --> 00:19:01,280
From now on, if you see
my stories lying around here

391
00:19:01,316 --> 00:19:02,284
don't read them.

392
00:19:02,318 --> 00:19:03,514
Don't even touch them.

393
00:19:03,554 --> 00:19:04,955
Just leave them
right where they are.

394
00:19:04,991 --> 00:19:06,153
No problem.

395
00:19:06,193 --> 00:19:08,164
Just put them away
when you're not working on them.

396
00:19:08,198 --> 00:19:09,241
Time to hit the shower.

397
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,308
Duty calls.

398
00:19:10,344 --> 00:19:13,340
Remember, start
with the lighter weights

399
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:14,683
and work your way up.

400
00:19:28,187 --> 00:19:30,658
Quark, what are you doing
back there?

401
00:19:34,836 --> 00:19:36,864
You need any help?

402
00:19:36,907 --> 00:19:40,712
You want to help?
Here.

403
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:44,256
I thought you were supposed

404
00:19:44,292 --> 00:19:46,456
to be repairing
the subspace transmitter.

405
00:19:46,498 --> 00:19:47,557
I was.

406
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,864
What's it doing out here?

407
00:19:48,903 --> 00:19:51,432
The signal booster's
completely shot

408
00:19:51,476 --> 00:19:53,470
which means there's no way
we can transmit

409
00:19:53,515 --> 00:19:56,181
a distress signal
through a planetary atmosphere.

410
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,521
I see.

411
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,898
So you tore it out of the wall
in frustration.

412
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:05,568
Actually, I came up with a way
to save our lives.

413
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:06,577
Mm-hmm.

414
00:20:06,612 --> 00:20:07,706
All we have to do

415
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,812
is haul this transmitter
to higher ground.

416
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:14,261
More altitude, less atmosphere.

417
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:18,069
Go high enough, and we might
be able to get a signal out.

418
00:20:18,106 --> 00:20:20,475
And how much higher
do we have to go?

419
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:23,610
Uh... carry the seven

420
00:20:23,653 --> 00:20:28,255
take the square root
times pi...

421
00:20:28,297 --> 00:20:30,564
I'd say, uh...

422
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:34,142
that high.

423
00:20:48,813 --> 00:20:50,476
I'm ready when you are.

424
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:52,248
Where'd you find that?

425
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:54,260
In the back.
It's pretty cozy.

426
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,426
Great.
Then I won't need this.

427
00:20:57,467 --> 00:20:58,936
I'll just get a suit for myself.

428
00:20:59,004 --> 00:21:00,063
We can be on our way.

429
00:21:00,107 --> 00:21:01,075
Don't bother.

430
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:02,168
This is the only one

431
00:21:02,212 --> 00:21:03,704
that wasn't destroyed
in the explosion.

432
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,291
You mean, there's only
one survival suit

433
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,894
and you're going to wear it?

434
00:21:11,969 --> 00:21:14,099
Finders keepers.

435
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,908
Besides, carrying this
transmitter up the mountain

436
00:21:16,981 --> 00:21:19,009
should keep you warm.

437
00:21:32,886 --> 00:21:34,185
Here we go.

438
00:21:34,222 --> 00:21:38,221
How can it be so cold
when the sun is shining?

439
00:21:38,265 --> 00:21:40,259
It isn't much of a sun

440
00:21:40,303 --> 00:21:42,501
and this isn't
much of a planet.

441
00:21:42,542 --> 00:21:45,106
And you've got a lot of nerve
complaining about being cold

442
00:21:45,149 --> 00:21:46,641
when you're the one
wearing the jacket.

443
00:21:46,686 --> 00:21:48,987
Well, you agreed
to take turns.

444
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:50,458
Under duress.

445
00:21:50,494 --> 00:21:51,861
Oh, I hate this.

446
00:21:51,898 --> 00:21:53,333
If I was still a changeling

447
00:21:53,368 --> 00:21:55,737
I could've shape-shifted
into a Vorian pterodactyl

448
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:57,437
and flown
that damn transmitter

449
00:21:57,478 --> 00:21:59,175
to the top of
the mountain hours ago.

450
00:21:59,215 --> 00:22:00,980
You're the one
who wanted to be a solid.

451
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,355
I never wanted to be a solid.

452
00:22:03,392 --> 00:22:04,588
Oh, please.

453
00:22:04,628 --> 00:22:07,465
I used to see you

454
00:22:07,502 --> 00:22:10,236
coming into the bar,
watching Morn eat...

455
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:12,246
eyeing my customers

456
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,245
as they gambled and flirted
with the dabo girls

457
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:18,487
wishing you were one of them.

458
00:22:18,528 --> 00:22:19,929
Not to mention

459
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:22,061
your platonic friendship
with a certain Bajoran Major.

460
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,436
If that's the kind
of psychological insight

461
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:26,742
you dispense with your drinks

462
00:22:26,782 --> 00:22:28,753
it's a wonder you have
any customers.

463
00:22:28,787 --> 00:22:30,552
Deny it all you want

464
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:34,395
but the fact is, your people
gave you what you wanted.

465
00:22:35,469 --> 00:22:37,906
You're one of us now

466
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:40,139
and I can finally
sit on a chair

467
00:22:40,181 --> 00:22:43,553
and know with absolute certainty
that it isn't you.

468
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:45,983
Quark! Quark!

469
00:22:46,028 --> 00:22:47,588
What?

470
00:22:47,631 --> 00:22:51,971
Uh... if you've damaged
that transmitter...

471
00:22:52,008 --> 00:22:55,004
I'm fine, thank you very much

472
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:57,077
and so is the transmitter.

473
00:22:57,187 --> 00:22:58,656
Here, let me help you up.

474
00:22:58,691 --> 00:23:00,217
No, thanks.

475
00:23:00,262 --> 00:23:04,135
I think I'll just lay here
and freeze to death.

476
00:23:04,171 --> 00:23:06,735
All right, all right,
you've made your point.

477
00:23:06,777 --> 00:23:09,044
I'll carry the transmitter
for a while.

478
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:13,185
And I get to wear the jacket.

479
00:23:14,195 --> 00:23:17,897
But I get the trousers.

480
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,496
You did a good job today, Nog.

481
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:22,446
You've an excellent grasp
of mechanical engineering.

482
00:23:22,482 --> 00:23:25,182
Ferengis have a natural
talent for figures, sir.

483
00:23:25,222 --> 00:23:27,022
So what's your posting tomorrow?

484
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:29,087
Cargo Bay 6...
customs inspection.

485
00:23:29,131 --> 00:23:31,695
Ah, well, that
could be interesting.

486
00:23:31,737 --> 00:23:34,676
If you're planning on being
a customs inspector.

487
00:23:43,732 --> 00:23:45,600
Hey, Nog.

488
00:23:45,637 --> 00:23:47,835
Not again.

489
00:23:50,582 --> 00:23:53,316
When I left this morning,
this place was spotless.

490
00:23:53,356 --> 00:23:55,657
Yeah, that was nine hours ago.

491
00:23:55,694 --> 00:23:57,858
You can't keep our quarters
clean for one day?

492
00:23:57,899 --> 00:24:00,770
A man's got to live
and sometimes, living is messy.

493
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:03,107
But it doesn't
have to stay messy!

494
00:24:03,146 --> 00:24:05,983
I'm going to the Replimat
to get something to eat.

495
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,079
And when I come back

496
00:24:07,122 --> 00:24:08,853
I expect to see this place
straightened up.

497
00:24:08,893 --> 00:24:10,761
I'm working on a story
right now.

498
00:24:10,797 --> 00:24:12,232
I'll do it in the morning.

499
00:24:13,905 --> 00:24:16,103
This isn't a story.

500
00:24:16,144 --> 00:24:17,875
It's computerized dom-jot!

501
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:21,081
Sometimes, when I get stuck,
I play dom-jot.

502
00:24:21,122 --> 00:24:22,682
It clears my mind.

503
00:24:22,726 --> 00:24:23,751
Well, while you're at it

504
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,162
how about clearing a path
to the bedroom?

505
00:24:25,198 --> 00:24:27,226
I told you, I'm busy.

506
00:24:29,341 --> 00:24:32,371
Jake, this isn't
what we agreed to.

507
00:24:32,415 --> 00:24:34,180
We didn't agree to anything.

508
00:24:34,287 --> 00:24:37,055
You've been shouting orders
ever since you moved in here.

509
00:24:37,094 --> 00:24:38,586
I'm not in Starfleet.

510
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:39,689
Lucky for you.

511
00:24:39,733 --> 00:24:41,100
You wouldn't last
a day at the Academy.

512
00:24:41,137 --> 00:24:42,127
You're right.

513
00:24:42,172 --> 00:24:44,439
I'd die of embarrassment
wearing those pajamas.

514
00:24:44,478 --> 00:24:46,107
You know, I don't have
to take that

515
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:47,880
from an undisciplined jerk
like you.

516
00:24:49,123 --> 00:24:51,755
Enjoy your dom-jot.

517
00:24:51,796 --> 00:24:53,026
Where are you going?

518
00:24:53,065 --> 00:24:54,364
Anywhere but here!

519
00:24:54,401 --> 00:24:56,599
I'll get my things
in the morning.

520
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,802
I'll pack them for you.

521
00:24:57,843 --> 00:24:59,210
Don't bother.

522
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,947
You couldn't fold a shirt
if your life depended on it.

523
00:25:10,607 --> 00:25:12,372
What's that over there?

524
00:25:13,748 --> 00:25:15,582
It's just another stone.

525
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:17,556
I can't believe it.

526
00:25:17,591 --> 00:25:19,653
I've been walking
for three days

527
00:25:19,696 --> 00:25:21,461
and I haven't seen
a single beetle.

528
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,064
I could really go
for a beetle right now...

529
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:25,165
any kind of beetle

530
00:25:25,209 --> 00:25:26,735
just as long as it had
a little meat on it.

531
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,340
There are no beetles, Quark.

532
00:25:28,383 --> 00:25:29,716
A nice slug would do.

533
00:25:29,753 --> 00:25:31,086
There are no slugs, either.

534
00:25:31,123 --> 00:25:34,791
No slugs, no beetles,
no worms, no snails.

535
00:25:34,832 --> 00:25:37,896
Nothing but rocks and trees,
and we can't eat any of it.

536
00:25:37,939 --> 00:25:39,101
If I collapse from hunger

537
00:25:39,142 --> 00:25:41,375
you've got to carry me
and the transmitter.

538
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:44,046
You are not going to collapse.

539
00:25:44,088 --> 00:25:45,991
We're almost to the tree line.

540
00:25:46,025 --> 00:25:49,898
After that, we've only got a
few more hours of climbing left

541
00:25:49,935 --> 00:25:51,666
before we can set up
the transmitter.

542
00:25:51,705 --> 00:25:53,436
A few hours?
You mean like three?

543
00:25:53,477 --> 00:25:55,948
Uh. More like six.

544
00:25:55,982 --> 00:25:58,249
I could do six.

545
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:01,593
Seven might be pushing it,
but six I could do.

546
00:26:01,629 --> 00:26:02,791
Come on.

547
00:26:08,746 --> 00:26:11,947
Forget about six hours.

548
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:14,790
It's more like six days.

549
00:26:23,005 --> 00:26:26,947
10,751... 10,752...

550
00:26:26,982 --> 00:26:27,950
Quark...

551
00:26:27,984 --> 00:26:29,248
10,753...

552
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:30,654
Quark!

553
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,593
I just want to know
how far we're going.

554
00:26:32,629 --> 00:26:35,466
Every step down means
an extra step up.

555
00:26:35,502 --> 00:26:36,732
Fine.
Then count to yourself.

556
00:26:36,771 --> 00:26:38,172
I don't want to hear it anymore.

557
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,734
Fine.
Don't talk to me.

558
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:41,180
It's hard keeping track.

559
00:26:41,216 --> 00:26:44,121
By the time the Grand Jury
gets through with you

560
00:26:44,156 --> 00:26:46,890
you'll be counting years
instead of steps.

561
00:26:46,929 --> 00:26:49,493
You know what's going to
make all this worthwhile?

562
00:26:49,535 --> 00:26:50,765
What?

563
00:26:50,805 --> 00:26:53,903
The look on your face
when they let me go.

564
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,380
Ha! Let you go?

565
00:26:55,416 --> 00:26:56,715
I don't think so.

566
00:26:56,752 --> 00:26:59,418
And you call yourself
a detective.

567
00:26:59,459 --> 00:27:02,523
The Orion Syndicate
tried to kill me.

568
00:27:02,566 --> 00:27:05,437
They never kill their own.
They don't need to.

569
00:27:05,473 --> 00:27:08,605
Any one of them would
take their own life

570
00:27:08,648 --> 00:27:12,419
before testifying
against the Syndicate.

571
00:27:12,457 --> 00:27:14,086
Don't you get it?

572
00:27:14,128 --> 00:27:17,101
I'm not a suspect.

573
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,504
I'm a witness.

574
00:27:22,782 --> 00:27:24,308
Now you made me lose count.

575
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:26,789
10,785.

576
00:27:26,824 --> 00:27:27,792
Thank you.

577
00:27:27,827 --> 00:27:30,162
Now, let me get this straight.

578
00:27:30,199 --> 00:27:32,933
You were never a member
of the Orion Syndicate?

579
00:27:32,973 --> 00:27:34,636
I hate to disappoint you.

580
00:27:34,676 --> 00:27:36,874
But you must have tried to join.

581
00:27:36,915 --> 00:27:38,544
I don't want to talk about it.

582
00:27:38,586 --> 00:27:39,611
Ah...

583
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,257
Now, if I remember correctly

584
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:47,465
the Orion Syndicate
has a membership fee...

585
00:27:47,507 --> 00:27:49,101
quite a substantial one...

586
00:27:49,145 --> 00:27:51,013
and the Ferengi
Commerce Authority

587
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:54,181
did seize all your assets.

588
00:27:55,393 --> 00:27:58,230
Oh, it's even worse
than that, isn't it?

589
00:27:58,266 --> 00:28:01,866
You never could afford
to join, could you?

590
00:28:01,908 --> 00:28:05,907
All those years of scheming
and lying and cheating

591
00:28:05,952 --> 00:28:10,726
and you're still too small-time
for the Orions.

592
00:28:11,866 --> 00:28:13,358
Well...

593
00:28:13,402 --> 00:28:16,740
I guess you're not as
successful a businessman

594
00:28:16,777 --> 00:28:18,440
as you think you are.

595
00:28:18,482 --> 00:28:20,076
Which means you spent

596
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:22,113
the last ten years
of your life

597
00:28:22,157 --> 00:28:24,025
trying to catch a nobody.

598
00:28:24,061 --> 00:28:26,294
With little success,
I might add.

599
00:28:26,368 --> 00:28:30,104
So you tell me... which one of us
is the bigger failure?

600
00:28:34,554 --> 00:28:39,020
10,788... 10,789...

601
00:28:39,064 --> 00:28:42,037
10,790, 10,791...

602
00:28:52,129 --> 00:28:54,327
Snail juice, extra shells.

603
00:28:54,368 --> 00:28:56,305
Make it a double.

604
00:29:00,717 --> 00:29:04,021
Captain, may I join you?

605
00:29:04,057 --> 00:29:05,492
Be my guest.

606
00:29:08,334 --> 00:29:11,000
I wanted to ask you...
about Nog.

607
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,944
You know, my son?

608
00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:14,209
I think I've met him.

609
00:29:15,618 --> 00:29:19,720
Have you noticed anything...
strange about him lately?

610
00:29:19,762 --> 00:29:21,459
He seems fine to me.

611
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,835
He's just more dedicated
than when he left.

612
00:29:23,872 --> 00:29:25,672
I've noticed.

613
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:28,342
A year at the Academy
will do that to people.

614
00:29:28,382 --> 00:29:29,908
You think it's the Academy?

615
00:29:29,952 --> 00:29:31,512
What else could it be?

616
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:37,970
I was afraid
he might be the changeling.

617
00:29:38,006 --> 00:29:41,036
So, while he was asleep,
I drew some blood

618
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,108
just to make sure.

619
00:29:43,151 --> 00:29:45,749
It's been eight hours.

620
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:47,158
So far, so good.

621
00:29:47,195 --> 00:29:49,963
Rom, he's still your son.

622
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,372
He's just taking his duties
very seriously, that's all.

623
00:29:53,409 --> 00:29:56,075
Nog's moved back in
with me, you know.

624
00:29:56,116 --> 00:29:57,551
It's horrible.

625
00:29:57,586 --> 00:29:59,750
He put me on report
the other day.

626
00:29:59,791 --> 00:30:01,556
Said my tool kit was untidy.

627
00:30:01,596 --> 00:30:04,125
That's the exact word
he used... untidy.

628
00:30:04,168 --> 00:30:06,036
Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.

629
00:30:06,073 --> 00:30:08,841
He's just going
through a phase, that's all.

630
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,614
I was hoping living
with Jake would relax him.

631
00:30:11,653 --> 00:30:15,059
I'm afraid Jake's going through
a phase of his own.

632
00:30:15,095 --> 00:30:16,724
I don't know
what's so difficult

633
00:30:16,765 --> 00:30:19,499
about putting a dirty dish
back into the replicator.

634
00:30:19,572 --> 00:30:21,440
Nog says Jake is

635
00:30:21,477 --> 00:30:27,151
a slovenly, undisciplined,
unfocused... writer.

636
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,627
Not an unfair assessment.

637
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:31,793
You know, I sometimes wish

638
00:30:31,835 --> 00:30:35,742
Jake had a little more
of Nog's self-discipline.

639
00:30:35,777 --> 00:30:38,773
And I wish Nog had Jake's
ability to enjoy himself.

640
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:44,656
Those two could learn
a lot from each other.

641
00:30:44,699 --> 00:30:47,536
If we could only get them
in the same room.

642
00:31:01,573 --> 00:31:04,010
Quark, wake up.

643
00:31:04,045 --> 00:31:06,745
We've got a mountain to climb.

644
00:31:08,322 --> 00:31:09,416
Quark.

645
00:31:12,231 --> 00:31:13,393
Quark?

646
00:31:15,439 --> 00:31:16,703
Quark?

647
00:31:17,911 --> 00:31:19,574
Quark.

648
00:31:19,616 --> 00:31:20,880
Wake up.

649
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:23,254
Wake up.
Wake, wake, Quark!

650
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:24,920
Stop hitting me!

651
00:31:26,967 --> 00:31:28,402
I thought you were dead.

652
00:31:28,437 --> 00:31:30,408
And you saw that
as an opportunity

653
00:31:30,442 --> 00:31:32,345
to vent years of hostility
towards me?

654
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,872
Towards me...

655
00:31:33,917 --> 00:31:35,888
towards... me...

656
00:31:35,922 --> 00:31:36,890
hostility...

657
00:31:36,924 --> 00:31:38,257
What's wrong?

658
00:31:38,294 --> 00:31:39,262
What?

659
00:31:39,296 --> 00:31:40,264
I said what's the matter.

660
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:41,427
I'm deaf.

661
00:31:41,468 --> 00:31:42,767
I'm deaf in my right ear.

662
00:31:42,804 --> 00:31:44,000
I can't hear anything.

663
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:46,308
Hello. Hello? Hello?

664
00:31:46,346 --> 00:31:47,781
Hello. Hello.

665
00:31:47,816 --> 00:31:49,012
Hello... hello.

666
00:31:49,053 --> 00:31:50,420
Would you stop doing that?

667
00:31:50,456 --> 00:31:51,652
You don't understand.

668
00:31:51,726 --> 00:31:53,993
A one-eared Ferengi
is only half a man.

669
00:31:54,032 --> 00:31:55,296
We got to get out of here.

670
00:31:55,335 --> 00:31:56,634
My body's shutting down.

671
00:31:56,671 --> 00:31:57,639
It's too cold.

672
00:31:57,673 --> 00:31:58,835
There's not enough to eat.

673
00:31:58,877 --> 00:32:00,471
I'm dying!
We both are!

674
00:32:00,514 --> 00:32:01,744
We're not dying!

675
00:32:01,784 --> 00:32:05,156
Here, here. You can have
the rest of my rations.

676
00:32:05,192 --> 00:32:06,160
These aren't rations.

677
00:32:06,194 --> 00:32:07,390
These are crumbs.

678
00:32:07,431 --> 00:32:10,233
You can't climb a mountain
on crumbs.

679
00:32:10,271 --> 00:32:12,071
Fine.
I'll go by myself.

680
00:32:12,108 --> 00:32:13,908
You're going to leave me?

681
00:32:13,946 --> 00:32:15,917
What do you want me to do?

682
00:32:15,951 --> 00:32:19,187
Stay here and trade insults
until we both starve to death?

683
00:32:19,225 --> 00:32:21,662
I'd rather take my chances
on the mountain.

684
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:24,670
Whose turn is it
to carry the transmitter?

685
00:32:24,772 --> 00:32:26,071
Yours.

686
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:27,806
Figures.

687
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:29,783
Figures?

688
00:32:29,817 --> 00:32:31,582
Figures.

689
00:32:37,836 --> 00:32:41,607
I hate this transmitter,
and I hate this mountain

690
00:32:41,645 --> 00:32:44,516
and most of all,
I hate the Orion Syndicate

691
00:32:44,553 --> 00:32:45,715
for stranding us here.

692
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,623
I think we both know
who's really to blame.

693
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,858
Don't try and blame
this on me, Constable.

694
00:32:49,899 --> 00:32:54,239
It was your job to get me
to Inferna Prime safely.

695
00:32:54,276 --> 00:32:55,244
But you never told me

696
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,714
the Orion Syndicate
was after you.

697
00:32:56,749 --> 00:32:58,218
You never asked.

698
00:32:58,252 --> 00:33:01,658
If I had, would you
have told me the truth

699
00:33:01,693 --> 00:33:03,356
or would you have lied

700
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:07,465
like you... lie
about everything?

701
00:33:07,508 --> 00:33:09,411
Have I ever told you how much

702
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:13,011
I hate that smug,
superior attitude of yours?

703
00:33:13,054 --> 00:33:14,614
Have I ever told you
how much I hate

704
00:33:14,658 --> 00:33:16,492
your endless whining,
your pathetic greed

705
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:18,830
your idiotic little schemes?

706
00:33:18,868 --> 00:33:21,032
Well, I hate...

707
00:33:21,074 --> 00:33:21,556
What do you hate?

708
00:33:21,688 --> 00:33:23,852
You.

709
00:33:23,894 --> 00:33:26,024
Well, that's fine with me

710
00:33:26,066 --> 00:33:28,560
because I hate you, too.

711
00:33:28,605 --> 00:33:31,008
You're nothing
but a petty thief.

712
00:33:31,045 --> 00:33:33,312
You're an arrogant prude.

713
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,512
Lecher!

714
00:33:34,552 --> 00:33:35,782
Freak.

715
00:33:35,822 --> 00:33:36,916
Fraud!

716
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:37,927
Fascist!

717
00:33:37,961 --> 00:33:39,692
Failure!

718
00:33:39,732 --> 00:33:40,962
Oh...

719
00:33:41,001 --> 00:33:41,969
Fascist!

720
00:33:42,004 --> 00:33:42,972
Failure!

721
00:33:43,006 --> 00:33:44,669
Fascist!
Fascist!

722
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:56,064
Quark?

723
00:33:56,105 --> 00:33:57,438
What?

724
00:33:57,474 --> 00:33:59,604
Are you all right?

725
00:33:59,647 --> 00:34:01,845
I'm fine.

726
00:34:03,889 --> 00:34:05,757
I'm not.

727
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:08,061
My leg is broken.

728
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,092
That should hold it together.

729
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:26,667
Now... we just have
to get you on it.

730
00:34:26,711 --> 00:34:28,648
Stop looking at the leg.

731
00:34:28,682 --> 00:34:29,878
You'll pass out again.

732
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:32,483
Not looking at it doesn't help.

733
00:34:32,525 --> 00:34:34,860
I still know it's there.

734
00:34:34,898 --> 00:34:38,134
I'm the one who should be
struggling to stay conscious.

735
00:34:38,238 --> 00:34:42,305
I'm the one
who's in excruciating pain.

736
00:34:42,348 --> 00:34:45,880
Speaking of pain,
this is probably going to hurt.

737
00:34:49,299 --> 00:34:50,461
Oh... Quark...

738
00:34:50,502 --> 00:34:54,444
there's no way you're going
to be able to drag me

739
00:34:54,477 --> 00:34:55,810
up that mountain.

740
00:34:55,848 --> 00:34:56,976
Just watch me.

741
00:34:57,017 --> 00:34:58,452
Stop trying to be a hero!

742
00:34:58,487 --> 00:35:01,483
You'll get to the top faster
if you leave me behind.

743
00:35:01,528 --> 00:35:02,587
Don't you get it?

744
00:35:02,631 --> 00:35:04,431
I'm not trying to rescue you.

745
00:35:04,468 --> 00:35:08,273
I'm taking you along
as emergency rations.

746
00:35:08,311 --> 00:35:12,082
If you die,
I'm going to eat you.

747
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,714
You're joking.

748
00:35:13,757 --> 00:35:16,753
Waste not... want not.

749
00:35:18,067 --> 00:35:19,661
Comfortable?

750
00:35:19,704 --> 00:35:21,173
Not really.

751
00:35:21,242 --> 00:35:23,406
Join the club.

752
00:36:12,498 --> 00:36:14,492
Higher.

753
00:36:18,245 --> 00:36:19,475
Hold on, Odo!

754
00:36:19,515 --> 00:36:21,144
Hold on.

755
00:36:26,899 --> 00:36:29,132
Hold on!

756
00:36:58,642 --> 00:37:00,613
Quark.

757
00:37:00,647 --> 00:37:02,880
It's over.

758
00:37:02,919 --> 00:37:04,582
What do you mean, it's over?

759
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:07,289
I can't move.

760
00:37:07,363 --> 00:37:10,895
We'll have to set up
the transmitter here.

761
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:12,567
We're not high enough.

762
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:16,014
You have to... leave me here
and go on by yourself.

763
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:18,317
Don't you understand?

764
00:37:18,389 --> 00:37:20,052
I can't do it.

765
00:37:20,093 --> 00:37:22,793
I'm half frozen.

766
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:25,168
I haven't eaten for days.

767
00:37:25,206 --> 00:37:29,308
My muscles won't work anymore!

768
00:37:32,656 --> 00:37:33,989
Odo?

769
00:37:35,664 --> 00:37:37,133
Well, say something.

770
00:37:37,168 --> 00:37:39,605
What is there to say?

771
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,137
If we stay here... we're dead.

772
00:37:43,182 --> 00:37:45,746
I can't go any further.

773
00:37:49,264 --> 00:37:54,642
If Sisko were here,
do you think he'd give up?

774
00:37:54,676 --> 00:37:56,579
Or Worf, or Dax?

775
00:37:56,614 --> 00:37:58,174
They're not here.

776
00:37:58,218 --> 00:37:59,414
That's right.

777
00:37:59,488 --> 00:38:01,014
It's just us.

778
00:38:06,571 --> 00:38:08,200
Give me the transmitter!

779
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:09,541
What for?

780
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:12,312
Just... give it to me.

781
00:38:12,352 --> 00:38:14,448
What are you doing?

782
00:38:17,764 --> 00:38:19,393
What does it look like?

783
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:21,531
You'll never make it.

784
00:38:21,574 --> 00:38:22,907
Maybe not.

785
00:38:26,251 --> 00:38:29,418
You're trying to embarrass me,
aren't you?

786
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,333
You're trying to shame me
into carrying that thing

787
00:38:33,369 --> 00:38:35,772
the rest of the way on my own.

788
00:38:35,808 --> 00:38:38,781
Well, it's not going to work.

789
00:38:38,815 --> 00:38:41,344
You might as well accept
the inevitable

790
00:38:41,388 --> 00:38:42,857
and die with dignity.

791
00:38:42,892 --> 00:38:44,795
That's what I'm going to do.

792
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:47,461
I'm just going
to lie here and die!

793
00:38:57,995 --> 00:39:00,968
My brother will get the bar.

794
00:39:01,002 --> 00:39:06,345
My nephew will be completely
corrupted by the Federation

795
00:39:06,381 --> 00:39:09,149
and become
a Starfleet Captain...

796
00:39:09,188 --> 00:39:11,854
and my bones...

797
00:39:11,894 --> 00:39:15,859
will lie here and freeze...

798
00:39:15,904 --> 00:39:19,002
unsold and unmourned.

799
00:39:31,474 --> 00:39:35,313
Try not to break your other leg
while I'm gone.

800
00:39:35,351 --> 00:39:37,014
I'll do my best.

801
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:47,702
Good luck.

802
00:39:59,609 --> 00:40:01,238
Come in.

803
00:40:04,955 --> 00:40:06,185
Dad.

804
00:40:06,225 --> 00:40:08,059
I thought you were going
to call first.

805
00:40:08,096 --> 00:40:09,429
Yeah, well.

806
00:40:09,466 --> 00:40:10,799
Well, we've got a problem.

807
00:40:10,835 --> 00:40:12,031
Well, what's wrong?

808
00:40:12,072 --> 00:40:13,541
According to station regulations

809
00:40:13,575 --> 00:40:15,306
these quarters require
two occupants or more.

810
00:40:15,347 --> 00:40:17,044
I'm afraid you're going
to have to move out.

811
00:40:17,084 --> 00:40:19,750
Smaller quarters.
All right, if I have to.

812
00:40:19,791 --> 00:40:20,953
Well, that's the problem.

813
00:40:20,994 --> 00:40:22,862
There are no smaller
quarters available.

814
00:40:22,898 --> 00:40:24,926
So, where do I go?

815
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:27,031
I guess back home with me.

816
00:40:28,078 --> 00:40:29,103
You're kidding.

817
00:40:29,146 --> 00:40:31,276
Well, unless we can find
you another roommate.

818
00:40:31,318 --> 00:40:32,377
Cadet!

819
00:40:34,593 --> 00:40:36,996
Sir, I really must protest.

820
00:40:37,032 --> 00:40:40,005
Cadets don't have that
privilege... neither do you.

821
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:41,736
Now...

822
00:40:41,777 --> 00:40:43,839
I know the two of you
are very different people

823
00:40:43,882 --> 00:40:44,976
but you're still friends

824
00:40:45,017 --> 00:40:47,147
and somehow, some way,
you'll make this work.

825
00:40:47,189 --> 00:40:49,023
I don't know.

826
00:40:49,128 --> 00:40:50,027
Neither do I.

827
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,292
Well, I do

828
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:53,668
and I'm your Captain...
and I'm your father.

829
00:40:53,705 --> 00:40:56,006
And what I say goes.

830
00:40:56,044 --> 00:40:57,947
Good day, gentlemen.

831
00:41:01,357 --> 00:41:05,299
Well... place hasn't
changed much, has it?

832
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:06,461
I guess not.

833
00:41:06,502 --> 00:41:09,999
Are you going
to start cleaning again?

834
00:41:10,077 --> 00:41:12,606
No. I've got to study.

835
00:41:13,854 --> 00:41:15,848
Good, because it'll
take a long time

836
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:17,258
to clean up this pig sty.

837
00:41:17,295 --> 00:41:19,289
It's not that bad.

838
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:20,859
It's bad.

839
00:41:20,903 --> 00:41:21,871
Yeah.

840
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,243
You want to go to the gym?

841
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:27,946
Healthy body, healthy mind.

842
00:41:27,987 --> 00:41:29,456
I have a better idea.

843
00:41:29,491 --> 00:41:31,553
How about a game of dom-jot?

844
00:41:31,596 --> 00:41:32,826
I'll let you break.

845
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:34,426
You're on.

846
00:41:56,924 --> 00:41:58,827
Quark!

847
00:42:05,377 --> 00:42:07,314
Quark!

848
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:16,027
Begin recording.

849
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:20,445
Chief of Security's Log,
final entry.

850
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,046
It looks like
Quark didn't make it.

851
00:42:24,089 --> 00:42:26,060
Can't say I'm surprised.

852
00:42:26,094 --> 00:42:29,124
You'll find his body
farther up the slope.

853
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:33,405
No doubt he'd want
to vacuum desiccate his remains

854
00:42:33,444 --> 00:42:35,642
and auction them off.

855
00:42:35,683 --> 00:42:39,625
Not that they're worth... much.

856
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,597
As for myself...

857
00:42:45,373 --> 00:42:48,711
cremate me,
stick my ashes in my bucket

858
00:42:48,747 --> 00:42:51,184
and shoot me
through the wormhole.

859
00:42:51,254 --> 00:42:54,888
I might as well
end up where I began.

860
00:42:54,929 --> 00:42:56,957
Or better yet...

861
00:43:06,022 --> 00:43:07,651
Bashir to Infirmary.

862
00:43:07,693 --> 00:43:09,664
Prepare an IV drip
of polynutrient solution.

863
00:43:09,698 --> 00:43:10,666
Aye, sir.

864
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,759
I'm alive.

865
00:43:11,802 --> 00:43:13,465
Yes. I'm going
to see you stay that way.

866
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:14,475
Quark?

867
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:16,980
We found him
on top of the mountain

868
00:43:17,015 --> 00:43:18,644
slumped over
a subspace transmitter.

869
00:43:18,686 --> 00:43:20,417
You mean he made it?

870
00:43:20,457 --> 00:43:23,453
If it wasn't for his signal,
we never would have found you.

871
00:43:23,498 --> 00:43:25,469
Looks like he saved
both of your lives.

872
00:43:25,503 --> 00:43:28,773
I was afraid you'd say that.

873
00:43:40,972 --> 00:43:42,066
Odo.

874
00:43:42,109 --> 00:43:45,811
Odo! You awake?

875
00:43:45,851 --> 00:43:48,220
I am now.

876
00:43:48,256 --> 00:43:50,386
We survived.

877
00:43:50,428 --> 00:43:51,727
We did.

878
00:43:51,765 --> 00:43:54,465
I bet you were surprised.

879
00:43:54,505 --> 00:43:57,205
I actually made it
all the way to the top.

880
00:43:57,245 --> 00:43:59,546
Astounded.

881
00:43:59,584 --> 00:44:02,078
You remember back there...

882
00:44:02,123 --> 00:44:04,721
when I told you I hated you

883
00:44:04,762 --> 00:44:07,599
and you told me you hated me?

884
00:44:07,637 --> 00:44:09,938
Vividly.

885
00:44:09,976 --> 00:44:11,673
I just wanted you to know...

886
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,480
I meant every word of it.

887
00:44:17,593 --> 00:44:19,962
So did I.
