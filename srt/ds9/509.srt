1
00:00:01,543 --> 00:00:03,420
SISKO: Don't you think
you might be over packing?

2
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:05,130
It'll close.

3
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:08,174
You don't have to take everything at once.
It's not like you're moving to Bajor.

4
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,385
1-G-12 is practically right next door.

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,471
I know, but I'm not moving to 1-G-12.

6
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:14,389
Huh?

7
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:15,849
I found some great quarters
over in Section M.

8
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:18,518
That's all the way
on the other side of the Habitat Ring.

9
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,645
Dad, don't get all sentimental on me.

10
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,605
Wait 'till your son moves out on you.

11
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:24,607
I don't have a son.

12
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:27,402
Ha! Hoo-hoo!

13
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,446
Go ahead, Jake. Make jokes.

14
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,448
One day, you'll be standing where I am

15
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,284
and believe me,
you won't like it any more than I do.

16
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,078
Yeah, maybe,
but right now, I'm standing here

17
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,456
and I can't wait to spend my first night
in my own place.

18
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,625
See?
I told you it'd close.

19
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,462
Now, wait, wait. Let me get this straight.

20
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,048
I can visit any time I want
but I have to call first.

21
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,508
You're not available for breakfast
or lunch,

22
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,802
but I can count on one dinner a week.

23
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,138
Yeah, well, some weeks, maybe even two.

24
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:58,349
Oh. I have raised
a very generous son.

25
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:06,608
You and Nog moving in together.
I can remember when I didn't even want you

26
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,609
talking to him.

27
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,486
Yeah, well, things change.

28
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:10,487
They sure do.

29
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:28,379
( door chimes )

30
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:31,674
Come in.

31
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,137
Oh, it's you?

32
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,847
Who'd you think it was?

33
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:38,848
Nog.

34
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,060
How could it be Nog?
His ship hasn't even docked yet.

35
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,103
I guess I wasn't thinking.

36
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,230
What else is new?

37
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:48,316
Can I help it if I'm excited?
My son is coming home.

38
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,401
Root beer?

39
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,988
His favorite.

40
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,658
I don't know how to thank you, Brother.

41
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,035
Ten slips of latinum ought to do it.

42
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,996
Do you think he'd mind if I had one
for myself?

43
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,997
I'd mind.

44
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,585
( sighing )

45
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,338
My own brother drinking root beer.

46
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,466
It's so... hu-man.

47
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:16,261
Mmm... and bubbly.

48
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,471
( door chimes )

49
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,099
That's him. That's him. Come in.

50
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,351
Wrong again.

51
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,602
NOG: Constable.

52
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,355
Care for a root beer?

53
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,024
No, but you have something
I do want.

54
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,485
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

55
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,070
Don't tell me.

56
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,073
Tell the Federation Grand Jury
on Inferna Prime.

57
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,826
Federation Grand Jury?
Brother, what have you done now?

58
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,662
I haven't done anything.
What do they want to talk to me for?

59
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,330
Oh, I think you know.

60
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,959
Odo, I have no idea
what this is all about.

61
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,796
Well, then, you'll have eight days
to try and guess.

62
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,172
We leave immediately.

63
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,550
-"We"?
-ODO: I've been waiting

64
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,635
ten years for you to get what you deserve.

65
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,472
Now that the big moment is finally here,
I wouldn't miss it for anything.

66
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,432
Let's go.

67
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,309
-Brother!
-What?

68
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,186
I'll say "Hi" to Nog for you.

69
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,605
Yeah.

70
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,990
So, how much longer 'till we reach
Inferna Prime?

71
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:30,288
{\an8}Oh, I'd say 191 hours and 17 minutes
give or take a day.

72
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:33,082
{\an8}In that case, we better find something
to occupy our time.

73
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,002
{\an8}Care for a game of fizzbin?

74
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,087
{\an8}I don't play cards.

75
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,173
{\an8}I'll teach you.
It's a very simple game.

76
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:44,886
{\an8}Let me put it another way.
I don't want to play cards,

77
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:48,014
{\an8}and even if I did, I wouldn't want
to play with you.

78
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,265
{\an8}QUARK: Afraid you'd lose?

79
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,308
{\an8}( chuckling )

80
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:53,144
{\an8}You know, Odo,
I used to think all your problems

81
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,438
{\an8}stemmed from the fact
that you were a changeling.

82
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,440
{\an8}Isolated from your own kind,

83
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,443
{\an8}forced to live among strangers
who didn't understand you.

84
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,112
{\an8}You couldn't eat, you couldn't drink

85
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,449
{\an8}you couldn't sleep,
you couldn't make love.

86
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,619
{\an8}QUARK: Was it any wonder
you had such a bad disposition?

87
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,872
{\an8}But you're not a changeling anymore.
You're one of us.

88
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,333
{\an8}Life is yours for the taking.

89
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,794
{\an8}All you have to do is reach out
and grab it.

90
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:23,091
{\an8}But do you? No.

91
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:30,556
{\an8}Because solid or changeling, you're still
a miserable self-hating misanthrope.

92
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:36,395
That's who you are,
and that's who you'll always be.

93
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,275
I'm still not playing cards with you.

94
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,530
Fine. Then we'll just sit here
for a week in silence.

95
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,201
What are you reading?

96
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,911
Nothing that would interest you.

97
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,913
-QUARK: Don't be so sure.
-Quark, give me that.

98
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,581
What are you going to do, arrest me?

99
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,666
( groans )

100
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:01,337
"He walked towards her, the wooden deck

101
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,508
"heaving to and fro
beneath his booted feet.

102
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,845
"Her hands moved
to the brooch at her throat.

103
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:12,849
"She unclasped it, and the cloak fell

104
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,392
"from her shoulders,

105
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:18,855
"her wet skin glistening
in the moonlight.

106
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:23,860
"Lightning flashed
and heaven's thunder roared

107
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,820
in rhythm
with the beating of their hearts."

108
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,822
-All right, enough.
-Odo, I take it all back.

109
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,741
You're obviously
a lot more complicated than I thought.

110
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:35,788
If you like that kind of thing,
I might be interested in selling you

111
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,082
my first edition of <i>Vulcan Love Slave.</i>

112
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,501
This is work, not recreation.

113
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:44,130
Books like this give me an insight
into the criminal mind.

114
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:48,426
It is a well-known fact
that a high percentage of homicides

115
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,679
are motivated by romantic obsession.

116
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,099
Well, no one gets killed
in <i>Vulcan Love Slave,</i>

117
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,061
but it's still a hell of a read.

118
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,857
Oh, give it up, Quark.

119
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:07,320
You can annoy me, bait me,
question my very existence

120
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,573
but in the end, we both know I've won.

121
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:14,577
Because when all is said and done
I'll be heading back to Deep Space 9

122
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,871
and you'll be spending
the rest of your life

123
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:19,248
in a Federation penal colony.

124
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,250
I'm not there yet.

125
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,543
Mm-hmm.

126
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,296
Look, Odo,
give me a chance.

127
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,089
At least, tell me what the charges are.

128
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,259
I'm afraid I can't do that.
This is a high-security investigation.

129
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,638
I'm not allowed
to discuss the specifics with anyone.

130
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:34,972
Now...

131
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,390
If you'll excuse me...

132
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,104
I have some reading to do.

133
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,912
Cadet Nog,
reporting for duty, sir.

134
00:08:58,829 --> 00:08:59,997
At ease, Cadet.

135
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,542
All right.

136
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,877
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

137
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:10,550
I remember my sophomore year.
Field studies, Starbase 137.

138
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,678
When I first got there,
I was a little apprehensive...

139
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,682
but it turned out
to be one of the best experiences

140
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:18,891
of my life.

141
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:19,809
Yes, sir.

142
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:20,810
Well.

143
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,480
Now, the key to field study
is simple.

144
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,607
Keep your eyes and ears open,
follow orders,

145
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,442
and try not to get in the way.

146
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,570
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.

147
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,071
I won't let you down.

148
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,076
I'd like to say, on a personal note...

149
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,246
I'm glad you and Jake
are going to be roommates.

150
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:41,747
Yes, sir.

151
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,709
I'm sure the two of you
are going to have, uh...

152
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,378
A lot of fun together.

153
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,088
Yes, sir.

154
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,298
Time permitting, sir.

155
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:54,051
I mean, if I'm not too busy.
After all, I am here to work.

156
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,178
Don't worry, sir.

157
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,471
I'll look after him for you.

158
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,806
Set a good example.

159
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,641
Keep him out of trouble.

160
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,353
You inspire me with confidence, Cadet.

161
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,484
Dismissed.

162
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,533
How'd it go?

163
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,827
I inspire him.

164
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,204
Congratulations.

165
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,206
Now don't let him down.

166
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,958
You can count on me, sir.

167
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,796
( sighing )

168
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,799
Lights!

169
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,261
( laughing )

170
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,055
So, what do you think?

171
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,432
I think I've died
and gone to the Divine Treasury.

172
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,267
After living in cadet barracks

173
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,853
for the past year,
this is going to be paradise.

174
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,022
Yeah, I know what you mean.

175
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,358
We're on our own now.

176
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,526
No one to tell us what to do.

177
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,987
Well, before we unpack,

178
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,739
we should call maintenance
to clean this place.

179
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,282
They were here yesterday.

180
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,159
Well, if you want
something done right,

181
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,702
you have to do it yourself.

182
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,079
I'll do the clean
on the odd-numbered days.

183
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,664
And you'll do it on the even ones.

184
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,458
We're going to clean every day?

185
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,294
No, just the odd and even ones.

186
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,963
Look, I'd better start
bringing in my things.

187
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,673
I don't want to be up
too late unpacking.

188
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:15,800
So what do you want
to do tonight?

189
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,052
Dom-jot? Holosuites?

190
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,138
I wish I could,
but once we eat and unpack,

191
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,556
it'll be time for bed.

192
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,058
Lights out at 2200.

193
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,685
I haven't gone to bed that early
since I was 12.

194
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,605
Go to sleep whenever you want,
but don't forget,

195
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,357
we're hitting the gym at 0430.

196
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,608
The gym?

197
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,443
Muscles, Jake.

198
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,362
You know, those things
that are supposed to go

199
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,738
between your bones
and your skin?

200
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:38,781
Yeah, I've heard of them.

201
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:42,368
Good. 'Cause by the time I'm done with you
you'll have some of your very own.

202
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,371
( chuckling )

203
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:46,539
( sighing )

204
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,231
( sighs )

205
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,321
You're doing it again.

206
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,199
Doing what?

207
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:23,742
Smacking your lips.

208
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,620
No, I'm not.

209
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,752
There.
Don't you hear that?

210
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,630
The only thing
I've heard for the past four days

211
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,049
is you complaining.

212
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:43,846
This whole runabout is alive
with annoying little noises.

213
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:46,682
Listen.

214
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,185
To what?

215
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,728
That buzzing noise.

216
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,565
I don't hear a thing.

217
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,192
It started over an hour ago.

218
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,862
If you don't like the noises
in here, why don't you go into the back?

219
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,239
Because it's even colder
back there than it is up here.

220
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,037
Quark, leave the temperature
controls alone.

221
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,706
I will, when I get it right.

222
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,211
There it is again.

223
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,297
What?

224
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,133
That buzzing noise.
Don't you hear it?

225
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,220
With all this lip smacking,
how could I hear anything?

226
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,139
Where's it coming from?

227
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,849
Inside your head.

228
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:29,808
QUARK: Shhh...

229
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,019
Bzzz...

230
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,437
I said be quiet!

231
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,564
( smacking lips )

232
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,607
( chuckling )

233
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,526
It's coming from here.

234
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:42,404
ODO: It's probably a defective
anodyne circuit.

235
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:46,242
Defective anodyne circuits
make a hissing sound.

236
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,537
This is a buzz.
We'd better open up this hatch.

237
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,582
If this is some sort of convoluted plot
to escape--

238
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,792
Stop being so suspicious.

239
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,461
-( buzzing )
-That's odd.

240
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,381
The buzzing's changed pitch.

241
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:04,051
It's gotten louder, too.
I can hear it now.

242
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,553
What could it be?

243
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,637
Let's find out.

244
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,810
Don't tell me.

245
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,727
Let me guess.

246
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,650
It's a bomb.

247
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,121
QUARK: Next time I tell you

248
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:37,001
I hear something, maybe you'll listen.
Let's hope there is a next time.

249
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:40,045
I'm going to get a transporter lock
on this thing and beam it out of here.

250
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,299
What if it's set to go off
if someone tries to transport it?

251
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,384
What do you suggest,
we wait for it to explode?

252
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,970
Fine. Beam it out

253
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,515
but at least try and channel the explosion
through the transporter buffer.

254
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,268
I hope this works.

255
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,649
( screaming )

256
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,818
( alarm blaring )

257
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,028
We did it!

258
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,279
We're safe.

259
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,576
I wouldn't be
so sure about that

260
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:16,248
( groaning ) Com system's down.
Navigational array's failing.

261
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,334
Environmental controls
are badly damaged.

262
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,712
-Oh. We're losing atmosphere.
-What now?

263
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,339
Now we find someplace to land.

264
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,590
Land? You mean crash.

265
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,343
It's either that or wait
for our lungs to explode

266
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,636
in the vacuum of space.

267
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,680
Ah! I'm picking up a Class-L planet
on long-range scanners.

268
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:32,848
Barely habitable.

269
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,225
More habitable than this thing's going
to be in a few minutes.

270
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,436
-How close?
-Close enough...

271
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,646
I hope.

272
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,365
If we live through this, whoever planted
that bomb is going to regret it.

273
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,451
Believe me, you don't want to get anywhere
near the Orion Syndicate.

274
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:56,413
The Orion Syndicate? Is that who
the Grand Jury's investigating?

275
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,540
I thought you knew.

276
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,001
If I knew you were involved
in the Orion Syndicate,

277
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,003
you'd be on the <i>Defiant</i> right now

278
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,630
surrounded by half my deputies.

279
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,303
Let me guess.
You pretended to know more than you did

280
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,515
so I'd think I had nothing to hide
and say something to incriminate myself.

281
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,726
-Something like that.
-This is all your fault.

282
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,229
You're the one who's a member
of the Orion Syndicate.

283
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,438
I'm not a member.

284
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:25,401
I just know people who know people
who know some other people, and besides...

285
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,114
( grunting )

286
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,407
( screaming )

287
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,750
Someone adjust the temperature.

288
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,711
It's freezing in here.

289
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:47,006
Actually... it's freezing out there.

290
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,549
Out there?

291
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,302
Uh... yeah.

292
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:56,473
Now I remember. You were apologizing

293
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,475
for almost getting us both killed.

294
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,145
Huh! If that's how you remember it,

295
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,189
you must've hit your head
harder than I thought you did.

296
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:09,820
I guess there's nothing we can do now
except send out a distress signal

297
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:10,738
and wait to be rescued.

298
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:15,617
Good plan, except we lost the com system
in the explosion.

299
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,202
That's not good.

300
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,497
Gets worse.
The replicator's been destroyed.

301
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,417
From what I can tell,
the local plants are poisonous.

302
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,003
Then I guess we're stuck
with field rations.

303
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,381
That's right, one package for you

304
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,133
one package for me.

305
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:32,468
The rest...

306
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,886
I know, I know.

307
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,055
Destroyed in
the explosion.

308
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,806
So now what?

309
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:42,186
Now we either freeze to death
or starve to death.

310
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,979
Take your pick.

311
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,651
( deep sigh )

312
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,612
It's about time you woke up.

313
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,448
I thought you were going to sleep all day.

314
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:58,118
You should stretch a little
before you start your workout.

315
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,329
I think I'll pass this morning.

316
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,414
You pass every morning.

317
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,500
You can work out for the both of us.

318
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,712
You don't know what you're missing.
A healthy body, a healthy mind.

319
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,131
Please, Nog, no clichés
before breakfast.

320
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,092
Orange juice, extra large.

321
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,846
A healthy way to start the day.

322
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,140
A writer and a poet.

323
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,102
What's this?

324
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,895
"Past Prologue."

325
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,563
What's it doing here?

326
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,524
I found it while
I was cleaning up.

327
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,318
Really, Jake, is it that hard
to keep this place clean?

328
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,195
You read my story?

329
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:34,988
What'd you think?

330
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,990
"Disposal" is spelled
with an "i."

331
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,284
That's it?
That's all you have to say?

332
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,370
I didn't really read it for content.

333
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,081
I mostly corrected your spelling
and grammar.

334
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,707
You changed my words?

335
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,708
Just a few.

336
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,503
A preposition here,
some punctuation there.

337
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,965
You can't change a writer's words
without his permission.

338
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,258
That's sacrilege!

339
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,509
All right.

340
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,302
Next time, I'll let you make the changes.

341
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,720
There won't be a next time.

342
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,807
From now on, if you see
my stories lying around here,

343
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,101
don't read them.
Don't even touch them.

344
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,102
Just leave them right where they are.

345
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,228
No problem.

346
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,772
Just put them away
when you're not working on them.

347
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:14,653
Time to hit the shower. Duty calls.
Remember, start with the lighter weights,

348
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:15,946
and work your way up.

349
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,959
( thumping )

350
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,503
Quark, what are you doing back there?

351
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,922
( thumping continues )

352
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:34,923
( disgusted groan )

353
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,509
You need any help?

354
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,597
You want to help? Here.

355
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,728
I thought you were supposed
to be repairing the subspace transmitter.

356
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:48,645
I was.

357
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:49,938
What's it doing out here?

358
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:54,443
The signal booster's completely shot,
which means there's no way we can transmit

359
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,945
a distress signal
through a planetary atmosphere.

360
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,072
I see.

361
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,367
So you tore it out of the wall
in frustration.

362
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,246
Actually, I came up with a way
to save our lives.

363
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:07,581
Mm-hmm.

364
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:11,793
All we have to do is haul this transmitter
to higher ground.

365
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,713
More altitude, less atmosphere.

366
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:19,051
Go high enough,
and we might be able to get a signal out.

367
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,345
And how much higher do we have to go?

368
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,806
Uh... carry the seven

369
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,852
take the square root
times pi...

370
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,104
I'd say, uh...

371
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,108
That high.

372
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,541
I'm ready when you are.

373
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,627
Where'd you find that?

374
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,128
In the back. It's pretty cozy.

375
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:58,215
( shuddering )
Great. Then I won't need this.

376
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,009
I'll just get a suit for myself.
We can be on our way.

377
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,428
Don't bother.
This is the only one

378
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,055
that wasn't destroyed
in the explosion.

379
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:12,187
You mean, there's only one survival suit
and you're going to wear it?

380
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,981
Finders keepers.

381
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,235
Besides, carrying this
transmitter up the mountain

382
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:19,695
should keep you warm.

383
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,824
( groaning )

384
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,710
ODO: Here we go.

385
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,089
How can it be so cold
when the sun is shining?

386
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:43,510
It isn't much of a sun
and this isn't much of a planet.

387
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:46,179
And you've got a lot of nerve complaining
about being cold

388
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,723
when you're the one wearing the jacket.

389
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,100
Well, you agreed to take turns.

390
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,310
Under duress.

391
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,769
Oh, I hate this.

392
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,396
If I was still a changeling,

393
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,773
I could've shape-shifted
into a Vorian pterodactyl

394
00:21:56,857 --> 00:22:00,235
and flown that damn transmitter
to the top of the mountain hours ago.

395
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,029
You're the one who wanted to be a solid.

396
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,448
I never wanted to be a solid.

397
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,949
Oh, please.

398
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:11,079
I used to see you
coming into the bar, watching Morn eat...

399
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,081
eying my customers

400
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:17,336
as they gambled and flirted
with the dabo girls

401
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,379
wishing you were one of them.

402
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,006
Not to mention

403
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,258
your platonic friendship
with a certain Bajoran Major.

404
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,384
( chuckles )

405
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,344
If that's the kind
of psychological insight

406
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,804
you dispense with your drinks,

407
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,598
it's a wonder you have any customers.

408
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,600
Deny it all you want,

409
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:35,437
but the fact is, your people
gave you what you wanted.

410
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,315
You're one of us now,

411
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,650
and I can finally sit on a chair

412
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,111
and know with absolute
certainty that it isn't you.

413
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,947
( yelling )

414
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,365
Quark! Quark!

415
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,325
What?

416
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,871
Uh... if you've damaged
that transmitter...

417
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,959
I'm fine, thank you very much,
and so is the transmitter.

418
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,628
Here, let me help you up.

419
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,213
No, thanks.

420
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:04,925
I think I'll just lay here
and freeze to death.

421
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,719
All right, all right,
you've made your point.

422
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,763
I'll carry the transmitter
for a while.

423
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,475
And I get to wear the jacket.

424
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,354
But I get the trousers.

425
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,607
You did a good job today, Nog.

426
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,110
You've an excellent grasp
of mechanical engineering.

427
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,737
Ferengis have a natural
talent for figures, sir.

428
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,280
So what's your posting tomorrow?

429
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,825
Cargo Bay 6, customs inspection.

430
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,744
Ah, well, that could be interesting.

431
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,871
If you're planning on being
a customs inspector.

432
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:45,882
Hey, Nog.

433
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,093
Not again.

434
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:54,015
When I left this morning,
this place was spotless.

435
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,143
Yeah, that was nine hours ago.

436
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,562
You can't keep our quarters
clean for one day?

437
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,273
A man's got to live and sometimes,
living is messy.

438
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,151
But it doesn't have to stay messy!

439
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,486
I'm going to the Replimat
to get something to eat.

440
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,573
And when I come back, I expect to see
this place straightened up.

441
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,658
I'm working on a story
right now.

442
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,243
I'll do it in the morning.

443
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,415
This isn't a story.
It's computerized dom-jot!

444
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:22,002
Sometimes, when I get stuck,
I play dom-jot.

445
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:23,295
It clears my mind.

446
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,630
Well, while you're at it,
how about clearing a path to the bedroom?

447
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,507
I told you, I'm busy.

448
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,762
Jake, this isn't what we agreed to.

449
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,848
We didn't agree to anything.

450
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,767
You've been shouting orders
ever since you moved in here.

451
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,102
I'm not in Starfleet.

452
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,605
Lucky for you.
You wouldn't last a day at the Academy.

453
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:42,647
You're right.

454
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,900
I'd die of embarrassment
wearing those pajamas.

455
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,528
You know, I don't have to take
that from an undisciplined jerk like you.

456
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,281
Enjoy your dom-jot.

457
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,658
Where are you going?

458
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,202
Anywhere but here!

459
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,037
I'll get my things in the morning.

460
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:58,413
I'll pack them for you.

461
00:24:58,496 --> 00:24:59,623
Don't bother.

462
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,708
You couldn't fold a shirt
if your life depended on it.

463
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,178
What's that over there?

464
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,598
It's just another stone.

465
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:18,183
I can't believe it.

466
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,853
I've been walking for three days
and I haven't seen a single beetle.

467
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,814
I could really
go for a beetle right now...

468
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,191
Any kind of beetle

469
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,776
just as long
as it had a little meat on it.

470
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,654
-There are no beetles, Quark.
-A nice slug would do.

471
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,113
There are no slugs, either.

472
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,784
No slugs, no beetles, no worms, no snails.

473
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,536
Nothing but rocks and trees,
and we can't eat any of it.

474
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,790
If I collapse from hunger, you've got
to carry me and the transmitter.

475
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:46,878
You are not going to collapse.
We're almost to the tree line.

476
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:50,674
After that, we've only got a few
more hours of climbing left

477
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,425
before we can set up the transmitter.

478
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,969
A few hours? You mean like three?

479
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,721
Uh. More like six.

480
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,890
I could do six.

481
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,394
Seven might be pushing it,
but six I could do.

482
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,311
Come on.

483
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:14,614
Forget about six hours.
It's more like six days.

484
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:28,044
Ten thousand seven hundred
and fifty one... 10,752...

485
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,045
Quark...

486
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,338
Ten thousand seven hundred
and fifty three...

487
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,256
Quark!

488
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:36,219
I just want to know how far we're going.
Every step down means an extra step up.

489
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:39,180
Fine. Then count to yourself.
I don't want to hear it anymore.

490
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,267
Fine. Don't talk to me.
It's hard keeping track.

491
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,186
By the time the Grand Jury
gets through with you,

492
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,981
you'll be counting years
instead of steps.

493
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:50,400
You know what's going
to make all this worthwhile?

494
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,318
What?

495
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,738
The look on your face when they let me go.

496
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:57,782
Ha! Let you go? I don't think so.

497
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,201
And you call yourself a detective.

498
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,663
The Orion Syndicate tried to kill me.

499
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:07,125
They never kill their own.
They don't need to.

500
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:11,463
Any one of them would take their own life
before testifying against the Syndicate.

501
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:14,632
Don't you get it?

502
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,010
I'm not a suspect.

503
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,971
I'm a witness.

504
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,393
Now you made me
lose count.

505
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,854
Ten thousand seven hundred
and eighty five.

506
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:28,897
Thank you.

507
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,690
Now, let me get this straight.

508
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:34,027
You were never a member
of the Orion Syndicate?

509
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,822
I hate to disappoint you.
But you must have tried to join.

510
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:38,948
I don't want to talk about it.

511
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,700
Ah...

512
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:41,785
( <i>chuckling </i>)

513
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:48,541
Now, if I remember correctly
the Orion Syndicate has a membership fee,

514
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,168
quite a substantial one,

515
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:54,631
and the Ferengi Commerce Authority
did seize all your assets.

516
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,091
( laughs )

517
00:27:56,216 --> 00:28:01,888
Oh, it's even worse than that, isn't it?
You never could afford to join, could you?

518
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:06,643
All those years of scheming
and lying and cheating

519
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:11,356
and you're still too small-time
for the Orions.

520
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,900
( laughs ) Well...

521
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:17,821
I guess you're not as successful
a businessman

522
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,197
as you think you are.

523
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:22,534
Which means you spent
the last ten years of your life

524
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:26,413
trying to catch a nobody.
With little success, I might add.

525
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:30,250
So you tell me, which one of us
is the bigger failure?

526
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:39,718
Ten thousand seven hundred
and eighty eight... 10,789...

527
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:43,930
Ten thousand seven hundred and ninety,
10,791...

528
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:44,973
( <i>frustrated grunt </i>)

529
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,276
Snail juice, extra shells.
Make it a double.

530
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,534
Captain, may I join you?

531
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:05,660
Be my guest.

532
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:14,002
I wanted to ask you... about Nog.
You know, my son?

533
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,587
I think I've met him.

534
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:20,800
Have you noticed anything...
strange about him lately?

535
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,385
He seems fine to me.

536
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,180
He's just more dedicated
than when he left.

537
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:26,431
I've noticed.

538
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,892
A year at the Academy
will do that to people.

539
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,685
You think it's the Academy?

540
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:31,895
What else could it be?

541
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,443
I was afraid he might be the changeling.

542
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,863
So, while he was asleep,
I drew some blood

543
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,323
just to make sure.

544
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,786
It's been eight hours.
So far, so good.

545
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,538
Rom, he's still your son.

546
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,792
He's just taking his duties
very seriously, that's all.

547
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,753
Nog's moved back in with me, you know.

548
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,546
It's horrible.

549
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,465
He put me on report the other day.

550
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,550
Said my tool kit was untidy.

551
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,011
That's the exact word he used...untidy.

552
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,763
SISKO: Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.

553
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,015
He's just going
through a phase, that's all.

554
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:12,310
I was hoping living
with Jake would relax him.

555
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:15,522
I'm afraid Jake's going through
a phase of his own.

556
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,273
I don't know what's so difficult

557
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,943
about putting a dirty dish
back into the replicator.

558
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:27,325
Nog says Jake is a slovenly,
undisciplined, unfocused... writer.

559
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,369
Not an unfair assessment.

560
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,747
You know, I sometimes wish

561
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:36,125
Jake had a little more
of Nog's self-discipline.

562
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:39,504
And I wish Nog had Jake's ability
to enjoy himself.

563
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,968
Those two could learn a lot
from each other.

564
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,804
If we could only get them
in the same room.

565
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,272
( groaning )

566
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,023
( shuddering )

567
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,237
Quark, wake up.

568
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:08,283
We've got a mountain
to climb.

569
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:09,701
Quark.

570
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,330
Quark?

571
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:16,958
Quark?

572
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:19,627
Quark.

573
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,838
Wake up.

574
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:24,215
Wake up.
Wake, wake, Quark!

575
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,550
Stop hitting me!

576
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,304
I thought you were dead.

577
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,515
And you saw that as an opportunity
to vent years of hostility towards me?

578
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,309
Towards me...

579
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,812
towards... me... hostility...

580
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:38,980
What's wrong?

581
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:39,898
What?

582
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,524
-I said what's the matter.
-I'm deaf.

583
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,944
I'm deaf in my right ear.
I can't hear anything.

584
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:49,949
Hello. Hello? Hello?
Hello. Hello. Hello... hello.

585
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,326
Would you stop doing that?

586
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,412
You don't understand.
A one-eared Ferengi is only half a man.

587
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,540
We got to get out of here.
My body's shutting down.

588
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,375
It's too cold.
There's not enough to eat.

589
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,003
-I'm dying! We both are!
-We're not dying!

590
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,633
Here, here. You can have the rest
of my rations. These aren't rations.

591
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:07,842
These are crumbs.

592
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,386
You can't climb a mountain on crumbs.

593
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,430
Fine. I'll go by myself.

594
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,307
You're going to leave me?

595
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:17,769
What do you want me to do?
Stay here and trade insults

596
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,312
until we both starve to death?

597
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,022
I'd rather take my chances
on the mountain.

598
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,776
Whose turn is it to carry the transmitter?

599
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,694
Yours.

600
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,237
Figures.

601
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,073
Figures?

602
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:31,741
Figures.

603
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,210
I hate this transmitter,
and I hate this mountain

604
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,088
and most of all,
I hate the Orion Syndicate

605
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,631
for stranding us here.

606
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,132
I think we both know
who's really to blame.

607
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,760
Don't try and blame this on me, Constable.

608
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:54,847
It was your job to get me
to Inferna Prime safely.

609
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,433
But you never told me
the Orion Syndicate was after you.

610
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,476
You never asked.

611
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:03,898
If I had, would you have told me the truth
or would you have lied

612
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,860
like you... lie about everything?

613
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,445
Have I ever told you how much

614
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:13,491
I hate that smug, superior attitude
of yours?

615
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:17,412
Have I ever told you how much I hate
your endless whining, your pathetic greed

616
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,747
your idiotic little schemes?

617
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:23,167
-Well, I hate...
-What do you hate?

618
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:24,502
You.

619
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,879
Well, that's fine with me

620
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:32,218
because I hate you, too.
You're nothing but a petty thief.

621
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,137
You're an arrogant prude.

622
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,346
Lecher!

623
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:36,597
Freak.

624
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:37,765
Fraud!

625
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,100
Fascist!

626
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,184
Failure!

627
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,477
Oh...

628
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,312
Fascist!

629
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,522
Failure!

630
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,274
Fascist! Fascist!

631
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,736
( both screaming )

632
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,697
( groans )

633
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,368
Quark?

634
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:58,578
What?

635
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,205
Are you all right?

636
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,165
I'm fine.

637
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,542
( gasping )

638
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,419
I'm not.

639
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:09,297
My leg is broken.

640
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,269
That should hold it together.

641
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:27,899
Now... we just have
to get you on it.

642
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,027
Stop looking at the leg.
You'll pass out again.

643
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,988
Not looking at it doesn't help.

644
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,823
I still know it's there.

645
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:39,660
I'm the one who should be struggling
to stay conscious.

646
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:43,581
( panting ) I'm the one
who's in excruciating pain.

647
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:47,335
Speaking of pain,
this is probably going to hurt.

648
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,294
( groaning )

649
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,548
Oh... Quark...

650
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,635
there's no way you're going
to be able to drag me

651
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:56,636
up that mountain.

652
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,637
Just watch me.

653
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,138
Stop trying to be a hero!

654
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,933
You'll get to the top faster
if you leave me behind.

655
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,937
Don't you get it?
I'm not trying to rescue you.

656
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,564
I'm taking you along as emergency rations.

657
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:12,652
If you die, I'm going to eat you.

658
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,362
You're joking.

659
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,031
Waste not... want not.

660
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:20,451
Comfortable?

661
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,703
Not really.

662
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,038
Join the club.

663
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,750
( groans )

664
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,524
( groaning )

665
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,464
( whispers ) Higher.

666
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,928
Hold on, Odo!

667
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,388
Hold on.

668
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,311
( grunting )

669
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,062
Hold on!

670
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:43,993
( cries out )

671
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,953
( grunts )

672
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,961
( panting )

673
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,636
Quark.

674
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:03,596
It's over.

675
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,389
What do you mean, it's over?

676
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,017
I can't move.

677
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,896
We'll have to set up the transmitter here.

678
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,481
We're not high enough.

679
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:17,235
You have to... leave me here
and go on by yourself.

680
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,362
Don't you understand?

681
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,322
I can't do it.

682
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,824
I'm half frozen.

683
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,910
I haven't eaten for days.

684
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:30,581
My muscles won't work anymore!

685
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:34,710
Odo?

686
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:37,797
Well, say something.

687
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,383
What is there to say?

688
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,886
If we stay here... we're dead.

689
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,681
I can't go any further.

690
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:54,897
If Sisko were here,
do you think he'd give up?

691
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,566
Or Worf, or Dax?

692
00:37:58,317 --> 00:37:59,151
They're not here.

693
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,236
That's right.

694
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:01,779
It's just us.

695
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,827
( straining grunts )

696
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:08,869
Give me the transmitter!

697
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:09,912
What for?

698
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,124
Just... give it to me.

699
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,750
What are you doing?

700
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,211
( grunting )

701
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,256
What does it look like?

702
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,550
You'll never make it.

703
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:23,551
Maybe not.

704
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,099
You're trying to embarrass me,
aren't you?

705
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:34,103
You're trying to shame me
into carrying that thing

706
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,772
the rest of the way on my own.

707
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,692
Well, it's not going to work.

708
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:43,654
You might as well accept the inevitable
and die with dignity.

709
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,031
That's what I'm going to do.

710
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:48,159
I'm just going to lie here and die!

711
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,285
( grunting )

712
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,589
My brother will get the bar.

713
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:07,470
My nephew will be completely
corrupted by the Federation

714
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:10,056
and become a Starfleet Captain...

715
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,017
And my bones...

716
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,853
Will lie here and freeze...

717
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:20,066
Unsold and unmourned.

718
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:36,040
Try not to break your other leg
while I'm gone.

719
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,583
I'll do my best.

720
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,051
( groans )

721
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,677
Good luck.

722
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,065
( door chimes )

723
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,525
Come in.

724
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:07,571
Dad.

725
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,657
I thought you were going to call first.

726
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,284
Yeah, well.
Well, we've got a problem.

727
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,536
Well, what's wrong?

728
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,037
According to station regulations

729
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,831
these quarters require
two occupants or more.

730
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,541
I'm afraid you're going
to have to move out.

731
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,544
Smaller quarters. All right, if I have to.

732
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:24,296
Well, that's the problem.
There are no smaller quarters available.

733
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,549
So, where do I go?

734
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,342
I guess back home with me.

735
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,928
( laughing ) You're kidding.

736
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,555
Well, unless we can find you
another roommate.

737
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:33,681
Cadet!

738
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,517
( door opens, closes )

739
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,644
Sir, I really must protest.

740
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,981
Cadets don't have
that privilege, neither do you.

741
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,149
Now...

742
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,359
I know the two of you
are very different people,

743
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,944
but you're still friends,

744
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,487
and somehow, some way,
you'll make this work.

745
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:50,406
I don't know.

746
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:51,657
Neither do I.

747
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:55,035
Well, I do and I'm your Captain
and I'm your father.

748
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,204
And what I say goes.

749
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,039
Good day, gentlemen.

750
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:06,338
Well... place hasn't changed much, has it?

751
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:07,756
I guess not.

752
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,301
Are you going
to start cleaning again?

753
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,138
No. I've got to study.

754
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:18,642
Good, because it'll take a long time
to clean up this pig sty.

755
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,020
It's not that bad.

756
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,354
It's bad.

757
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:23,856
( laughing ) Yeah.

758
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,357
( chuckling )

759
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:29,195
You want to go to the gym?
Healthy body, healthy mind.

760
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,821
I have a better idea.

761
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,073
How about a game of dom-jot?

762
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,325
I'll let you break.

763
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:36,368
You're on.

764
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,341
( groaning )

765
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,142
Quark!

766
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:08,692
Quark!

767
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,408
Begin recording.

768
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:21,247
Chief of Security's Log, final entry.

769
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:27,294
It looks like Quark didn't make it.
Can't say I'm surprised.

770
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:30,422
You'll find his body
farther up the slope.

771
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:34,927
No doubt he'd want to vacuum desiccate
his remains

772
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:36,845
and auction them off.

773
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,349
Not that they're worth... much.

774
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,393
As for myself...

775
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:50,651
cremate me,
stick my ashes in my bucket,

776
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,403
and shoot me through the wormhole.

777
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:55,656
I might as well
end up where I began.

778
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,534
Or better yet...

779
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,003
Bashir to Infirmary.

780
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:11,171
Prepare an IV drip
of polynutrient solution.

781
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,798
<i>-Aye, sir. </i>
-I'm alive.

782
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:15,426
Yes. I'm going
to see you stay that way.

783
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,427
Quark?

784
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,262
WORF: We found him
on top of the mountain

785
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,097
slumped over
a subspace transmitter.

786
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,141
You mean he made it?

787
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,727
If it wasn't for his signal
we never would have found you.

788
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:28,981
-Looks like he saved both of your lives.
-I was afraid you'd say that.

789
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,037
Odo.

790
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,040
Odo! You awake?

791
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:48,917
I am now.

792
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,045
We survived.

793
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:52,755
We did.

794
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:58,093
I bet you were surprised.
I actually made it all the way to the top.

795
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,095
Astounded.

796
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:05,684
You remember back there...
when I told you I hated you

797
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,729
and you told me you hated me?

798
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,606
Vividly.

799
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:13,692
I just wanted you
to know...

800
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,529
I meant every word of it.

801
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,449
So did I.

802
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:25,287
( laughs )

803
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:29,124
( both laughing )
