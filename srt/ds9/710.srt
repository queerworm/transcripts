1
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,800
What if I say
something dumb?

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,635
Something that makes
him uncomfortable?

3
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:10,761
Like what?

4
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:13,054
Like, "How's
your new leg?"

5
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:15,766
I think he's probably
expecting a few questions.

6
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,142
I just don't want
to say the wrong thing.

7
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,727
You'll be fine.

8
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,562
But maybe I shouldn't
be there when he arrives.

9
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:21,939
Why?

10
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,607
Well, when he was
in the hospital

11
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,275
he didn't answer
any of my letters.

12
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,736
That's okay.
I'm only his stepmother.

13
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,823
But he's going through
something so personal

14
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:32,783
maybe he only wants
his real family around.

15
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:34,618
You<i> are</i> real family.

16
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,203
That's right

17
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,747
and you should
both just relax.

18
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,207
Yes, Nog has lost a leg

19
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,834
and that's a
traumatic experience

20
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,669
but nothing you do
or say is going

21
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:45,671
to be worse than what
he's already gone through.

22
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:48,549
Just be happy to see him
and tell him you love him.

23
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,049
For today, that'll be enough.

24
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,635
They've docked.

25
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,061
Welcome aboard.
Thanks.

Aha, there you are.

27
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,480

28
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,356
How are you?

29
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:05,482
I'm fine.

30
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:15,701
Colonel, are you sure

31
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,077
this is the
right transport?

32
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,537
I checked the passenger list
this morning.

33
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:19,747
He definitely boarded it.

34
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,582

ROM: It's good
to have you home.
LEETA: Welcome home, Nog.

38
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:45,981
Thank you. Thank you.
It's good to be back.

00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,399

40
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:50,903

42
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,572
while the rest
of us work.

43
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:55,032
Hard work and
plenty of it--

44
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,117
that's what
I prescribe.

45
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,869
Captain, maybe he
forged those orders.

46
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,579
SISKO:
I'm afraid
they're genuine.

48
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:07,086
Except... to attend
a "Welcome Home"

49
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:08,545

50
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:16,177
If it's all the same
to you, sir,
I'm rather tired.

51
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:19,431
I'd rather just go
to my quarters.
Is that all right?

52
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:22,726
Absolutely. We can
celebrate once you've
settled in.

53
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,269
Great.

54
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,813
I can carry your bag.

55
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,106
I've got it.

56
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,567
Well, if you'll all excuse me.

57
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,372
...and Julian and Miles
have become even more obsessed

58
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,000
with their Alamo program,
if you can believe it.

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,418
I half expect Miles

60
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,879
to start wearing
a coonskin cap to work.

61
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:00,968
You see, Davy Crockett
wore this cap...

62
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,053
made of raccoon skin and...

63
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,471
I know the program.

64
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,306
Oh.

65
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,559
Well, I think
we've covered

66
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,769
just about everything
you missed

67
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,062
while you were away.

68
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,355
Is there anything
you want to talk about?

69
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,234
Not particularly.

What?

73
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,661
The "cane problem."

74
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,663
You're about
to ask me why

75
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,456
I need to walk
with a cane

76
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,374
since Dr. Benbasset told you

77
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,503
my biosynthetic leg works
perfectly.

78
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:41,091
He also told you the problem's
all in my head, that I'm crazy.

79
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,383
He didn't say that.

80
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,385
That's what he thinks.

81
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,221
Forget what he thinks.

82
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:47,806
What do you think?

83
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,516
Why do you need the cane?

84
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,601
My leg hurts.

85
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,812
And if I put
my full weight on it

86
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:56,481
it hurts more, so I have to limp

87
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,984
and that means I need
to walk with a cane.

88
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,069
That sounds reasonable to me.

89
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,322
Good.

Look, can I be
perfectly honest with you?

92
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,624
I've spent the last three weeks

93
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,626
talking about my feelings

94
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,129
with the counselors
on Starbase 235

95
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,049
and to tell you the truth,
I'm a little sick of it.

96
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,136
I just want to be left alone
for a while.

97
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,804
I understand.

98
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,766
I think we've
done enough for today.

99
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,936

I thought it might take
our minds off our troubles.

182
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:17,278
Is it bothering you?

183
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:22,701
No. It's kind of nice.

Take five, fellas.

201
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,550
Okay, kid, I know

202
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,469
15 different arrangements
of that song.

203
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,844
You've heard them all.

204
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:24,887
Now which one's
your favorite?

205
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,974
The first.

206
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,769
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
Somehow, I knew you
were going to say that.

207
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,688
So let me guess-- Julian
played it for you, right?

208
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,231
Right.

209
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,441
If I had him
as a publicist

210
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:37,858
I'd be bigger
than Elvis.

211
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,152
Who?

212
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,362
Never mind.

213
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,531
So... how's the new leg?

214
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,160
You know about that?

215
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,578
People talk.

216
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,627
If you really want to know...

217
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:57,587
it hurts.

218
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,964
Can they give you
something for that?

219
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:03,593
No. They say
it's all in my head.

220
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,054
"According to my tricorder

221
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:10,266
"the pain receptors in your leg
aren't being stimulated, Nog.

222
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,519
You must be imagining it."

223
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,355
But I don't care what they say.

224
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,440
It hurts all the time.

225
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,319
I believe you.

226
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,321
(<i> sighs</i> )

227
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,531
You're the only one.

228
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:28,827
So what else can I do for you?

229
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:29,869
Sing it again?

230
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,912
No.

231
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,080
Good.

232
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,624
To tell you the truth

233
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,917
I was starting to get
a little sick of it myself.

234
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,378
How about something else?

235
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,463
No.

236
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,424
I just want to go to bed.

237
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,345
Okay, kid.
Catch you later, huh?

238
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:48,429
Yeah.

239
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,769
Something wrong?

240
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:59,106
I don't want to go
back to my quarters.

241
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,983
(<i> sighs</i> )

242
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,486
Actually, I don't want
to go back to my life.

243
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,950
Vic...

244
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,079
where do you live?

245
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,956
In the program, I mean.

246
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,458
Do you have a house or...

247
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,085
I have a suite
here in the hotel.

248
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,796
Do you have an extra room?

249
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,382
Sure. You want to stay
with me tonight?

250
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,801
Maybe more than
just tonight.

251
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,262
Officially, I'm
on medical leave

252
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,638
and according
to regulations

253
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,766
I can choose my
rehabilitation facility.

254
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,810
You want to choose a holosuite
program for your rehab?

255
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,977
Why not?

256
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,315
Okay, kid... if that's
the way you want it

257
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,859
from now on,
you're staying with me.

258
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,277
Great.

259
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,404
Crazy.

260
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,035
My son is insane.

261
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,203
EZRI:
Rom...

262
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,538
He's a one-legged crazy man!

263
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,790
He is not crazy.

264
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,583
But he<i> is</i> living
in a holosuite.

265
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:04,171
At first, it struck me
as a little... peculiar

266
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,591
but after I thought it over,
I began to think

267
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,676
that this might be
a good sign after all.

268
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,470
How can hiding
in one of Julian's

269
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,138
adolescent programs
be a good sign?

270
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,723
Hey...
It could be worse.

271
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,558
He could be hiding
in the Alamo program.

272
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:16,810
LEETA:
Or that ridiculous

273
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,394
secret agent program.

274
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,562
Hey...

275
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:20,855
Or that stupid Viking program.

276
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,857
Hey!
All right.

277
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:26,152
Are you sure this is
in Nog's best interest?

278
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,904
No, I'm not sure

279
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:31,532
but I think Nog might be
subconsciously trying

280
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,785
to seek out his own
form of therapy.

281
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:37,246
I'm sorry, but moving
into a holosuite isn't my idea

282
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,331
of therapy.

283
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,249
Okay. It sounds
a little odd.

284
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,375
QUARK:
It sounds

285
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,961
ridiculous.
BASHIR:
Not really.

286
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:46,005
I'm inclined to agree
with Ezri on this one.

287
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,258
The mind has a strong natural
instinct for survival.

288
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,469
Now, for whatever reason,
Nog's mind has chosen

289
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,096
to take shelter in the
world of Vic Fontaine.

290
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,766
I think we should wait
and see how this plays out.

291
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,853
Then someone should talk
to Vic, make him aware

292
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,897
of Nog's emotional
and physical condition.

293
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,190
I'll do it.

294
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,525
And who's going
to be paying

295
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:06,776
for all this
holosuite time?

296
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,573
I guess I am.

297
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,075
And it's<i> very</i> generous of you.

298
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,997
Keep me informed.

299
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,338
I get it. He's got
some healing to do.

300
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,215
I could spot that
the moment he walked in here.

301
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,467
Great. Do you have
any questions?

302
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,886
You sure he doesn't
need the cane?

303
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,136
Because he's
pretty sure he does.

304
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,889
I'm positive.

305
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,640
It's a psychological need,
not a physical one.

306
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,933
Well, then I have
some ideas

307
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,351
on how to wean him
off the stick.

308
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,021
Okay, but don't push it.

309
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,564
Do I seem pushy to you?

310
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,984
No. Well, you know
how to reach me

311
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,068
if you have
any problems.

312
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,653
I got your number.

313
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,913
So you're Jack Wilson.

314
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,748
What's that mean
to<i> you,</i> Shane?

315
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,124
Hey, kid.

316
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,084
Hey, Vic.

317
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,335
Have you seen this movie?

318
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,503
Oh, yeah.

319
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,381
JACK:
What have you heard, Shane?

320
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,675
SHANE:
I've heard that you're a lowdown

321
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,510
Yankee liar.

322
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,937
Shane, look out!

323
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,399
From these books,
I can't tell

324
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:29,734
if I'm as rich
as Rockefeller

325
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,069
or poor as a church mouse.

326
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,445
It's not real money, Vic.

327
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,487
Don't worry about it.

328
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,531
Hey, it's real to me, kid.

329
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,951
Well, I can have the computer
put some money in your account.

330
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,035
No, thanks.

331
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,745
I'll figure it out.

332
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,624
I got to be going on.

333
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,294
Why, Shane?

334
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:51,005
Didn't he just get shot
a minute ago?

335
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,382
Yeah. He took one
in the arm.

336
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,801
He's not bleeding.

337
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,260
He's not even in pain.

338
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,096
Noggles, take it easy.
It's only a movie.

339
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:03,768
(<i> echoing</i> ):
Shane!

340
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:06,437
Come back!

341
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:22,870
I like
<i>The Searchers</i> better.

342
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,330
Yeah. Who doesn't?

343
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,498
Son of a gun.

344
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,000
I got to get ready
for the show.

345
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,293
Show? I thought
we were hanging in.

346
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,962
No, "hanging out."

347
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,839
And we are, except
I have a gig to do.

348
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:33,798
Cancel it.

349
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:34,882
I can't do that.

350
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:35,883
Why not?

351
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,010
It would be
unprofessional.

352
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,594
Besides, performing is my life.

353
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,762
It's what I do.

354
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,388
I got to get out there
and swing.

355
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,182
Otherwise, I'm just
another Clyde in a tux.

356
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,060
You coming
to the show?

357
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,105
Sure.

358
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:50,523
Good.

359
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,527
Then, may I suggest you, uh...

360
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,237

00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,952
do you dream?

544
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,038
Good night, kid.

545
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,624
Good night, Vic.

546
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:15,842
VIC:
So, when Dino goes in
to pick up his robe

547
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,303
he doesn't realize
that across the back

548
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:19,513
Frank has printed in
big bold letters...

549
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,890
I'll finish
the story later.

550
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,142
Hi, dollface.

551
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,184
Hi.

552
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,145
Where's Nog?
Up in the room--

553
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,729
still working on
the receipts from '61.

554
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,106
That kid's a hell
of an accountant.

555
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,732
He said the government
owes me money.

556
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:31,900
Can you believe that?

557
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,278
I need to talk to him.

558
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:35,362
Can it wait?

559
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,947
I'm afraid not.

560
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,865
It's about that thing
with Jake, right?

561
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,159
Is he pressing charges?

562
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,620
No. But I do think
that it's time for Nog

563
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,204
to leave the holosuite.

564
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,663
Wait-wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

565
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,458
He likes it here.
He's making progress.

566
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:49,251
Okay, he lost his cool.

567
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,086
But I don't think
that'll happen again.

568
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:54,131
Vic, he can't hide
in here forever.

569
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:56,634
He has to face reality sometime.

570
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:58,552
The kid's had too much
reality lately

571
00:27:58,552 --> 00:27:59,761
if you ask me.

572
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:00,971
He's lost a leg.

573
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:02,473
He's watched
good friends die.

574
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:04,183
Like you said,
we shouldn't push him.

575
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,892
He needs time to heal.

576
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,314
No offense, but you're
just a hologram

577
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:11,315
and I am his counselor.

578
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:12,650
I outrank you

579
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,152
and I feel that it's
time for him to go.

580
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:16,487
He's on medical leave

581
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:18,780
and according to
Starfleet Regulations

582
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,698
he can spend it
wherever he chooses.

583
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,993
How do you know that?

584
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:24,244
NOG:
I told him.

585
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,997
And if you try
to force me to leave

586
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,541
I'll resign
my commission.

587
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:29,667
Wait a minute.

588
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:30,750
Let's slow down here.

589
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,002
No one's
talking about

590
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:33,295
forcing anyone
to do anything.

591
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:34,921
Good.

592
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,465
Because Vic and I
have big plans.

593
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,342
We do?

594
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:39,801
I've been going
over your books,

595
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:40,886
and this place
is a latinum mine

596
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:42,095
and you don't
even know it.

597
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,722
In my opinion

598
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,599
it's time to expand
the business.

599
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,477
Nog, this is
a holosuite.

600
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,145
Of course
it's a holosuite.

601
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:54,483
But that doesn't mean
we can't build a new casino.

602
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,443
A new casino?

603
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,362
How much money do I have?

604
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:00,364
If you'll excuse us,
Counselor.

605
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,199
We have business
to conduct.

a little time, that's all.

Ah... we don't break ground
on the casino for about a week

693
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:10,071

to Tahoe for a couple of days.

than to ask you to give
away your secrets.

You probably have the
whole thing mapped out.

706
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:34,888
I mean, what
am I thinking?

707
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:36,055
That this new casino

708
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:38,016
is anything more
than a ploy?

709
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,476
That you'd
actually let him

710
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:41,979
live out the rest of
his life in a holosuite?

just a ploy

00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,791
he just needed a
break from reality.

723
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,835
Now all that's left
is to decide

724
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:06,545
when he's ready
to go back.

725
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,382
But I'll leave
that up to you.

726
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,091
See you around.

727
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,593
See ya.

728
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,988
Great set
tonight, Vic.

729
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,406
Thanks.

730
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:37,034
Lots of familiar
faces in the crowd.

731
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:39,327
Did I see Rom
and Leeta out there?

732
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,120
They came for a while.

733
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,373
What do you think about
moving the crap tables

734
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,333
over to the south wing

735
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,879
and expanding the slot
machines out into here?

736
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,171
Good idea.

737
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:53,050
I'll think it over.

738
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,968
But we're supposed
to meet with the architect

739
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,386
tomorrow morning.

740
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:57,596
Not anymore.

741
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:58,972
It's time for you
to go, kid.

742
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:00,473
Go where?

743
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,725
You know where.

744
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,977
It's time to end
the program.

745
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,022
But we've got work to do.

746
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:08,440
We have a casino to build.

747
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,942
No, we don't.

748
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:11,610
This is just a fantasy.

749
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,612
It's not real.

750
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:16,073
It's real to me
and it's real to you

751
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:17,365
and don't say it isn't.

752
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,116
I know better.

753
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,618
You're right.

754
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,286
It's very real to me.

755
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,081
But I'm a hologram, Nog.

756
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:25,707
I'm not a person.

757
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:27,918
Until you came along,
I'd never been on

758
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:30,087
for more than six or
seven hours straight.

759
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:31,379
I know.

760
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,048
And now you're
running all the time.

761
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:34,257
Isn't it great?

762
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,845
It's incredible.

763
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:41,640
Since you've
been here

764
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,310
I've slept in a bed every night,
gone to work every day--

765
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,854
had time to read the paper,
play cards with the boys.

766
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,188
I've had a life

767
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,024
and I have
to tell you

768
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:52,567
it's a precious thing.

769
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:56,822
I had no idea how much
it means to just... live.

770
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:59,407
And now I'm going
to return the favor

771
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,159
and give you your life back.

772
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,958
But I don't want that life
anymore, Vic.

773
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,501
I'm perfectly happy here.

774
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,752
What "here"?

775
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:12,420
There is no "here."

776
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,422
Don't you get it?
This is nowhere.

777
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,424
It's an illusion
and so am I.

778
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,801
In fact,
the only thing

779
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:19,011
in this entire program

780
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:20,303
that is not an illusion is you.

781
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:23,056
Okay. You're right...

782
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:26,726
but I'm not ready
to go back yet.

783
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,520
I need more time.

784
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:33,358
So let's just
sleep on this

785
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,110
and talk about it
tomorrow.

786
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,611
Kid...

787
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:39,197
I hate to do
this to you

788
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,449
but you're not giving
me any choice.

789
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,701
Computer...

790
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:43,994
No! Don't!

791
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:45,286
End program.

792
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,054
Oh, hi, Nog.

793
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:03,055
Chief.

794
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,430
Something wrong?

795
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,850
No, no. I, uh...
I was running

796
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,309
a diagnostic
in Ops

797
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,686
and I noticed a
magnetic flux anomaly

798
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:10,896
in the holosuite

799
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:12,564
transilluminator
circuits.

800
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:13,773
I didn't realize
it was you.

801
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,358
Sorry.

802
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,609
I'm just having trouble

803
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,611
getting the Las Vegas
program to run.

804
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,157
You know...

805
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:24,534
Vic's matrix is
a little different

806
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:27,537
than your standard
photokinetic hologram.

807
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,539
He can turn
himself off.

808
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:32,792
And if he doesn't
want to appear

809
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:33,960
he doesn't appear.

810
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,754
You mean, he has free will?

811
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:38,090
Hey, I'm an engineer,
not a philosopher.

812
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:42,177
All I know is, that when Vic
turns himself off, he's off

813
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,179
and ripping out the
guts of the holosuite

814
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,764
isn't going
to change that.

815
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,978
Anything else I
can do for you?

816
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,479
No.

817
00:37:56,858 --> 00:38:00,153
Oh, we, uh... we all
miss you in Ops.

818
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:01,320
Yeah.

819
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,284
So...

820
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,953
now that the Chief's told you

821
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:09,662
I'm smarter
than the average bear

822
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,664
will you stop messing around
with my holosuite?

823
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,750
If you turn the program back on.

824
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,377
What is it I'm not making
clear to you, Charlie?

825
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,462
You got to go.

826
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,340
Don't you get it?

827
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,176
I can't go out there.

828
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:25,262
Why not?

829
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,808
I'm scared... okay?

830
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,726
I'm scared.

831
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:40,860
When the war began...

832
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,780
I wasn't<i> happy</i> or anything

833
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,158
but I was eager.

834
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:50,703
I wanted to test myself.

835
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:55,458
I wanted to prove I had
what it took to be a soldier

836
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:59,004
and I saw
a lot of combat.

837
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:01,631
I saw a lot of people get hurt.

838
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,511
I saw a lot of people die

839
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,513
but I didn't think

840
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,515
anything was going
to happen to me

841
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:11,975
and then, suddenly

842
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:16,395
Dr. Bashir is telling me
he has to cut my leg off.

843
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:20,483
I couldn't believe it.

844
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:23,987
I still
can't believe it.

845
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:28,783
If I can get shot,
if I can lose my leg

846
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,494
anything can happen to me, Vic.

847
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,830
I could die tomorrow.

848
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,877
I don't know
if I'm ready to face that.

849
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:47,593
If I stay here, at least I know

850
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,929
what the future
is going to be like.

851
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:54,934
You stay here,
you're going to die

852
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:58,980
not all at once,
but little by little.

853
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,983
Eventually, you'll become
as hollow as I am.

854
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,362
You don't seem hollow to me.

855
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:08,031
Compared to you,
I'm hollow as a snare drum.

856
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:10,700
Look, kid, I don't
know what's going

857
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,493
to happen to
you out there.

858
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,537
All I can tell you is that...

859
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,540
you've got to play
the cards life deals you.

860
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,668
Sometimes you win,
sometimes you lose.

861
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,339
But at least you're in the game.

862
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,147
(<i> door opens</i> )

863
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:46,069
(<i> sighs</i> )

864
00:40:58,623 --> 00:40:59,749
Crazy.

865
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,794
ROM:
He seemed happy.

866
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,379
LEETA:
And he's stopped limping.

867
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:05,546
QUARK:
You're joking.

868
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,632
No. He's a new man.

869
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,134
You should go see him.

870
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:11,594
I don't think
I'll need to.

871
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,813
Hi.

872
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,315
Hi.

873
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:25,442
Are you okay?

874
00:41:25,442 --> 00:41:27,693
No...

875
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,404
but I will be.

876
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:53,136
Computer, run
program Bashir 62.

877
00:41:57,474 --> 00:41:59,434
Hi, kid.

878
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:00,477
Hey, nice threads.

879
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:01,519
Thanks.

880
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,561
You back at work?

881
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,814
Limited duty.

882
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:06,316
Just a couple
hours a day.

883
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:07,608
How's it feel?

884
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,527
Different.

885
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,945
I feel older.

886
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,239
Happens to the best of us.

887
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,992
I want to thank you
for all that you did for me.

888
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:17,660
That's not necessary.

889
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,329
You did something
for me, too.

890
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:20,538
You gave me a chance

891
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,081
to see what it's like
to have a life.

892
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,376
Well, you're going to
have that chance again.

893
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:26,252
I've made arrangements
with my Uncle Quark

894
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,753
to keep your
program running

895
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:30,089
26 hours a day
from now on.

896
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,508
What?

897
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:32,925
It's my gift to you.

898
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:37,055
Kid... I don't know
what to say.

899
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,265
Just put it
there, pally

900
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,558
and tell me
you'll always

901
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,018
save a seat
for me up front.

902
