1
00:00:06,237 --> 00:00:07,705
What if I say something dumb?

2
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:09,768
Something that makes
him uncomfortable?

3
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:10,779
Like what?

4
00:00:10,813 --> 00:00:13,010
Like, "How's your new leg?"

5
00:00:13,051 --> 00:00:15,784
I think he's probably
expecting a few questions.

6
00:00:15,823 --> 00:00:17,189
I just don't want
to say the wrong thing.

7
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:18,694
You'll be fine.

8
00:00:18,729 --> 00:00:20,722
But maybe I shouldn't
be there when he arrives.

9
00:00:20,767 --> 00:00:22,030
Why?

10
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:23,595
Well, when he was
in the hospital

11
00:00:23,639 --> 00:00:25,165
he didn't answer
any of my letters.

12
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:27,701
That's okay.
I'm only his stepmother.

13
00:00:27,747 --> 00:00:30,742
But he's going through
something so personal

14
00:00:30,787 --> 00:00:32,882
maybe he only wants
his real family around.

15
00:00:32,924 --> 00:00:34,985
You are real family.

16
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:36,462
That's right

17
00:00:36,497 --> 00:00:39,025
and you should both just relax.

18
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,538
Yes, Nog has lost a leg

19
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:42,167
and that's a
traumatic experience

20
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:43,906
but nothing you do
or say is going

21
00:00:43,946 --> 00:00:45,848
to be worse than what
he's already gone through.

22
00:00:45,883 --> 00:00:48,753
Just be happy to see him
and tell him you love him.

23
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:50,418
For today, that'll be enough.

24
00:00:50,459 --> 00:00:52,019
They've docked.

25
00:00:59,644 --> 00:01:01,341
- Welcome aboard.
- Thanks.

26
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:02,815
Aha, there you are.

27
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:03,819
Hi.

28
00:01:03,853 --> 00:01:04,821
How are you?

29
00:01:04,855 --> 00:01:05,845
I'm fine.

30
00:01:13,271 --> 00:01:15,868
Colonel, are you sure

31
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,173
this is the right transport?

32
00:01:17,212 --> 00:01:18,909
I checked the passenger list
this morning.

33
00:01:18,949 --> 00:01:20,110
He definitely boarded it.

34
00:01:20,152 --> 00:01:21,951
Here he comes.

35
00:01:40,525 --> 00:01:41,788
Welcome back, Nog.

36
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:42,888
It's good to have you home.

37
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:43,899
Welcome home, Nog.

38
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:44,901
Thank you.
Thank you.

39
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:45,903
It's good to be back.

40
00:01:45,937 --> 00:01:47,839
My orders, Captain.

41
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,539
"Medical leave"?
How could that be?

42
00:01:51,581 --> 00:01:53,278
Sounds like an excuse
to loaf around

43
00:01:53,318 --> 00:01:54,308
while the rest of us work.

44
00:01:54,353 --> 00:01:55,480
Hard work and plenty of it...

45
00:01:55,522 --> 00:01:57,515
that's what I prescribe.

46
00:01:57,559 --> 00:01:59,426
Captain, maybe he
forged those orders.

47
00:01:59,463 --> 00:02:01,092
I'm afraid they're genuine.

48
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:03,730
"Ensign Nog has no duties
until further notice."

49
00:02:03,772 --> 00:02:07,542
Except... to attend
a "Welcome Home"

50
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:09,412
party in the Wardroom.

51
00:02:12,957 --> 00:02:15,291
If it's all the same to you, sir

52
00:02:15,362 --> 00:02:16,728
I'm rather tired.

53
00:02:16,765 --> 00:02:18,997
I'd rather just go
to my quarters.

54
00:02:19,036 --> 00:02:20,095
Is that all right?

55
00:02:20,138 --> 00:02:21,106
Absolutely.

56
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,133
We can celebrate
once you've settled in.

57
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:24,737
Great.

58
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:26,478
I can carry your bag.

59
00:02:26,517 --> 00:02:27,883
I've got it.

60
00:02:29,456 --> 00:02:31,255
Well, if you'll all excuse me.

61
00:04:46,684 --> 00:04:49,052
...and Julian and Miles
have become even more obsessed

62
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:51,652
with their Alamo program,
if you can believe it.

63
00:04:51,694 --> 00:04:52,957
I half expect Miles

64
00:04:52,997 --> 00:04:55,764
to start wearing
a coonskin cap to work.

65
00:04:57,873 --> 00:05:00,606
You see, Davy Crockett
wore this cap...

66
00:05:00,645 --> 00:05:02,638
made of raccoon skin and...

67
00:05:02,682 --> 00:05:04,150
I know the program.

68
00:05:04,186 --> 00:05:05,849
Oh.

69
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,225
Well, I think we've covered

70
00:05:09,262 --> 00:05:10,628
just about everything
you missed

71
00:05:10,665 --> 00:05:11,633
while you were away.

72
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:14,195
Is there anything
you want to talk about?

73
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:17,072
Not particularly.

74
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,156
Here it comes.

75
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:25,455
What?

76
00:05:25,495 --> 00:05:27,431
The "cane problem."

77
00:05:27,465 --> 00:05:29,560
You're about to ask me why

78
00:05:29,603 --> 00:05:31,003
I need to walk with a cane

79
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,975
since Dr. Benbasset told you

80
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:36,107
my biosynthetic leg works
perfectly.

81
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:40,751
He also told you the problem's
all in my head, that I'm crazy.

82
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:42,283
He didn't say that.

83
00:05:42,328 --> 00:05:44,230
That's what he thinks.

84
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:45,757
Forget what he thinks.

85
00:05:45,869 --> 00:05:47,498
What do you think?

86
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:49,372
Why do you need the cane?

87
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:51,379
My leg hurts.

88
00:05:51,413 --> 00:05:53,474
And if I put
my full weight on it

89
00:05:53,517 --> 00:05:56,045
it hurts more, so I have to limp

90
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,652
and that means I need
to walk with a cane.

91
00:05:58,694 --> 00:06:00,926
That sounds reasonable to me.

92
00:06:02,068 --> 00:06:03,058
Good.

93
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:10,951
Look, can I be perfectly honest
with you?

94
00:06:12,388 --> 00:06:14,358
I've spent the last three weeks

95
00:06:14,392 --> 00:06:16,191
talking about my feelings

96
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,758
with the counselors
on Starbase 235

97
00:06:18,868 --> 00:06:21,863
and to tell you the truth,
I'm a little sick of it.

98
00:06:23,143 --> 00:06:26,047
I just want to be left alone
for a while.

99
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,746
I understand.

100
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,454
I think we've
done enough for today.

101
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,790
I'll see you tomorrow.

102
00:06:48,127 --> 00:06:50,690
Computer, what time is it?

103
00:06:50,731 --> 00:06:53,362
The time is 0932 hours.

104
00:07:26,536 --> 00:07:31,843
I'll be seeing you

105
00:07:31,947 --> 00:07:37,789
In all
the old familiar places

106
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:43,166
That this heart
of mine embraces...

107
00:07:43,203 --> 00:07:46,107
Jake says he's been sleeping
over 18 hours a day

108
00:07:46,143 --> 00:07:47,509
and Julian says he's missed

109
00:07:47,545 --> 00:07:49,708
his last two physical
therapy appointments.

110
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:52,778
And his counseling sessions
have been going nowhere.

111
00:07:52,822 --> 00:07:54,519
In his words,
he's "sick of talking

112
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:55,891
about his feelings."

113
00:07:55,928 --> 00:07:58,091
I can't say I blame him.

114
00:07:58,133 --> 00:08:00,069
He's been under constant
psychiatric care

115
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,367
for almost two months now.

116
00:08:01,406 --> 00:08:02,704
What should we do?

117
00:08:02,742 --> 00:08:05,373
I'm not sure.

118
00:08:05,414 --> 00:08:07,043
For now, I think our best bet

119
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:08,553
is to simply watch and wait.

120
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:09,953
Not my first choice.

121
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,048
I know

122
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:12,493
but sometimes a patient

123
00:08:12,528 --> 00:08:14,498
can help guide
his own treatment.

124
00:08:14,532 --> 00:08:17,025
Let's see what Nog does next.

125
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:32,961
...but I'll be seeing you.

126
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:45,817
I'll be seeing you

127
00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:52,097
In all the old

128
00:08:52,141 --> 00:08:53,906
Familiar places...

129
00:08:53,944 --> 00:08:56,507
Nog, I am trying
to be understanding

130
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,179
and I want to be your friend

131
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,951
but enough is enough!

132
00:09:00,057 --> 00:09:03,188
You've been playing that same
stupid song for three days.

133
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,029
I-I can't take it anymore.

134
00:09:07,138 --> 00:09:08,869
Aren't you going
to say anything?

135
00:09:08,907 --> 00:09:11,811
You've barely said three words
to me since you came home.

136
00:09:11,846 --> 00:09:14,477
Maybe I don't have
anything to say.

137
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:16,887
I'm trying to help you here, Nog

138
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,449
but you're not making it easy.

139
00:09:18,493 --> 00:09:21,932
You want to help me? Fine.

140
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:24,164
Leave me alone.

141
00:09:24,205 --> 00:09:26,733
All right. Okay.

142
00:09:26,776 --> 00:09:29,246
But if you want to hear
that song again

143
00:09:29,282 --> 00:09:31,149
go rent a holosuite!

144
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:47,398
Program is running.

145
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,271
You may enter when ready.

146
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,255
Hi, there, pally.

147
00:10:59,295 --> 00:11:00,729
Gee, it's good to see you.

148
00:11:00,764 --> 00:11:02,290
Vic Fontaine.

149
00:11:02,334 --> 00:11:04,736
I know. I'm Nog.

150
00:11:04,772 --> 00:11:05,899
You're Rom's kid, right?

151
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:06,909
Right.

152
00:11:06,943 --> 00:11:08,206
He's really proud of you.

153
00:11:08,246 --> 00:11:09,305
He's always in here bragging

154
00:11:09,348 --> 00:11:10,577
about his son,
the soldier boy.

155
00:11:10,617 --> 00:11:11,915
Yeah.

156
00:11:11,953 --> 00:11:13,421
What can I do for you?

157
00:11:13,457 --> 00:11:15,950
I want to hear
"I'll Be Seeing You."

158
00:11:15,994 --> 00:11:18,328
Sure thing, kiddo.
Any other requests?

159
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:23,104
No. Just...
"I'll Be Seeing You."

160
00:11:23,175 --> 00:11:24,769
Sounds like a special tune.

161
00:11:25,814 --> 00:11:27,443
It is.

162
00:11:27,485 --> 00:11:30,946
It helped me once
when I was... unhappy.

163
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:33,325
What more can you ask
from a song?

164
00:11:34,632 --> 00:11:37,695
"I'll Be Seeing You."
From the top.

165
00:11:49,695 --> 00:11:54,535
I'll be seeing you

166
00:11:54,572 --> 00:11:59,310
In all the old,
familiar places...

167
00:11:59,348 --> 00:12:00,441
Doctor...

168
00:12:00,484 --> 00:12:02,750
That this heart
of mine embraces...

169
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,256
Yes?

170
00:12:04,292 --> 00:12:05,955
What is that?

171
00:12:05,994 --> 00:12:08,761
It's a song that I had
Vic Fontaine record for me.

172
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,531
Vic...

173
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:12,939
Yes. He's a character
in a holosuite program of mine.

174
00:12:12,975 --> 00:12:15,913
I thought it might take
our minds off our troubles.

175
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:17,645
Is it bothering you?

176
00:12:17,685 --> 00:12:22,923
No. It's kind of nice.

177
00:12:22,962 --> 00:12:25,763
...the chestnut tree

178
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:29,707
The wishing well

179
00:12:29,742 --> 00:12:33,580
I'll be seeing you

180
00:12:33,617 --> 00:12:38,582
In every lovely summer's day

181
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:40,426
In everything

182
00:12:40,464 --> 00:12:43,197
That's bright and gay

183
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:46,298
I'll always think of you...

184
00:12:46,342 --> 00:12:50,214
...l'll find you
in the morning sun

185
00:12:50,317 --> 00:12:53,084
And when the night is new

186
00:12:53,122 --> 00:12:55,388
I'll be looking at the moon

187
00:12:55,427 --> 00:12:58,399
But I'll be seeing you

188
00:13:00,337 --> 00:13:04,175
I'll find you
in the morning sun

189
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:07,512
And when the night is new

190
00:13:07,551 --> 00:13:10,318
I'll be looking at the moon

191
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:14,525
But I'll be seeing you.

192
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,163
Thank you.

193
00:13:18,205 --> 00:13:19,195
Take five, fellas.

194
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,903
Okay, kid, I know

195
00:13:20,944 --> 00:13:22,811
15 different arrangements
of that song.

196
00:13:22,848 --> 00:13:24,180
You've heard them all.

197
00:13:24,217 --> 00:13:25,276
Now which one's your favorite?

198
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:28,019
The first.

199
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:30,894
Somehow, I knew you
were going to say that.

200
00:13:30,931 --> 00:13:33,926
So let me guess... Julian
played it for you, right?

201
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,438
Right.

202
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:36,874
If I had him as a publicist

203
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:38,241
I'd be bigger than Elvis.

204
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:39,473
Who?

205
00:13:39,515 --> 00:13:41,508
Never mind.

206
00:13:41,552 --> 00:13:43,852
So... how's the new leg?

207
00:13:46,161 --> 00:13:47,527
You know about that?

208
00:13:47,564 --> 00:13:49,055
People talk.

209
00:13:53,543 --> 00:13:55,945
If you really want to know...

210
00:13:55,981 --> 00:13:57,780
it hurts.

211
00:13:57,818 --> 00:14:00,449
Can they give you something
for that?

212
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,826
No. They say
it's all in my head.

213
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:07,096
"According to my tricorder

214
00:14:07,136 --> 00:14:10,597
"the pain receptors in your leg
aren't being stimulated, Nog.

215
00:14:10,644 --> 00:14:12,807
You must be imagining it."

216
00:14:12,848 --> 00:14:15,479
But I don't care what they say.

217
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,786
It hurts all the time.

218
00:14:20,497 --> 00:14:21,393
I believe you.

219
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,528
You're the only one.

220
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,704
So what else can I do for you?

221
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,901
Sing it again?

222
00:14:29,976 --> 00:14:31,878
No.

223
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,279
Good.

224
00:14:33,316 --> 00:14:34,409
To tell you the truth

225
00:14:34,452 --> 00:14:36,786
I was starting to get
a little sick of it myself.

226
00:14:36,823 --> 00:14:38,417
How about something else?

227
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,430
No.

228
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:43,402
I just want to go to bed.

229
00:14:44,672 --> 00:14:47,303
Okay, kid.
Catch you later, huh?

230
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,369
Yeah.

231
00:14:53,524 --> 00:14:54,890
Something wrong?

232
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,924
I don't want to go
back to my quarters.

233
00:15:01,005 --> 00:15:03,373
Actually, I don't want
to go back to my life.

234
00:15:08,286 --> 00:15:09,983
Vic...

235
00:15:11,526 --> 00:15:13,052
where do you live?

236
00:15:14,064 --> 00:15:16,034
In the program, I mean.

237
00:15:16,068 --> 00:15:17,559
Do you have a house or...

238
00:15:17,605 --> 00:15:19,131
I have a suite
here in the hotel.

239
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,904
Do you have an extra room?

240
00:15:21,947 --> 00:15:24,578
Sure. You want to stay
with me tonight?

241
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:26,714
Maybe more than just tonight.

242
00:15:26,756 --> 00:15:29,124
Officially, I'm on medical leave

243
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,561
and according to regulations

244
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:32,932
I can choose
my rehabilitation facility.

245
00:15:32,969 --> 00:15:35,873
You want to choose a holosuite
program for your rehab?

246
00:15:35,908 --> 00:15:37,035
Why not?

247
00:15:38,847 --> 00:15:41,181
Okay, kid...
if that's the way you want it

248
00:15:41,218 --> 00:15:42,709
from now on,
you're staying with me.

249
00:15:42,755 --> 00:15:44,349
Great.

250
00:15:45,426 --> 00:15:46,451
Crazy.

251
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:52,939
My son is insane.

252
00:15:52,975 --> 00:15:53,943
Rom...

253
00:15:53,977 --> 00:15:55,445
He's a one-legged crazy man!

254
00:15:55,481 --> 00:15:56,949
He is not crazy.

255
00:15:56,983 --> 00:15:58,680
But he is living in a holosuite.

256
00:16:00,356 --> 00:16:03,795
At first, it struck me
as a little... peculiar

257
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,700
but after I thought it over,
I began to think

258
00:16:06,736 --> 00:16:08,968
that this might be
a good sign after all.

259
00:16:09,007 --> 00:16:10,066
How can hiding
in one of Julian's

260
00:16:10,109 --> 00:16:11,908
adolescent programs
be a good sign?

261
00:16:11,946 --> 00:16:12,914
Hey...

262
00:16:12,948 --> 00:16:13,916
It could be worse.

263
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,783
He could be hiding
in the Alamo program.

264
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:18,520
Or that ridiculous
secret agent program.

265
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,721
Hey...

266
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:21,094
Or that stupid Viking program.

267
00:16:21,131 --> 00:16:21,655
Hey!

268
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,998
All right.

269
00:16:23,102 --> 00:16:26,336
Are you sure
this is in Nog's best interest?

270
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,004
No, I'm not sure

271
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:31,573
but I think Nog might be
subconsciously trying

272
00:16:31,619 --> 00:16:34,021
to seek out his own
form of therapy.

273
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:37,427
I'm sorry, but moving
into a holosuite isn't my idea

274
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:38,454
of therapy.

275
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,595
Okay.
It sounds a little odd.

276
00:16:40,637 --> 00:16:41,605
It sounds

277
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,039
- ridiculous.
- Not really.

278
00:16:43,075 --> 00:16:46,241
I'm inclined to agree
with Ezri on this one.

279
00:16:46,281 --> 00:16:49,481
The mind has a strong natural
instinct for survival.

280
00:16:49,522 --> 00:16:51,617
Now, for whatever reason,
Nog's mind has chosen

281
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:54,392
to take shelter in the
world of Vic Fontaine.

282
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,994
I think we should wait
and see how this plays out.

283
00:16:57,036 --> 00:17:00,065
Then someone should talk
to Vic, make him aware

284
00:17:00,176 --> 00:17:03,148
of Nog's emotional
and physical condition.

285
00:17:03,182 --> 00:17:04,445
I'll do it.

286
00:17:04,484 --> 00:17:05,679
And who's going to be paying

287
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:06,950
for all this holosuite time?

288
00:17:10,998 --> 00:17:12,831
I guess I am.

289
00:17:12,868 --> 00:17:15,361
And it's very generous of you.

290
00:17:17,878 --> 00:17:19,312
Keep me informed.

291
00:17:25,727 --> 00:17:27,663
I get it.
He's got some healing to do.

292
00:17:27,698 --> 00:17:29,565
I could spot that
the moment he walked in here.

293
00:17:29,602 --> 00:17:31,731
Great.
Do you have any questions?

294
00:17:31,773 --> 00:17:32,968
You sure he doesn't
need the cane?

295
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:34,671
Because he's
pretty sure he does.

296
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:36,078
I'm positive.

297
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:38,048
It's a psychological need,
not a physical one.

298
00:17:38,085 --> 00:17:39,280
Well, then I have some ideas

299
00:17:39,321 --> 00:17:40,812
on how to wean him
off the stick.

300
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:43,328
Okay, but don't push it.

301
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:44,853
Do I seem pushy to you?

302
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:48,394
No. Well, you know
how to reach me

303
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:49,566
if you have any problems.

304
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:51,043
I got your number.

305
00:17:58,058 --> 00:18:00,221
So you're Jack Wilson.

306
00:18:00,263 --> 00:18:02,199
What's that mean
to you, Shane?

307
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:04,237
Hey, kid.

308
00:18:04,271 --> 00:18:05,239
Hey, Vic.

309
00:18:05,273 --> 00:18:06,639
Have you seen this movie?

310
00:18:06,676 --> 00:18:07,644
Oh, yeah.

311
00:18:07,678 --> 00:18:10,775
What have you heard, Shane?

312
00:18:10,817 --> 00:18:14,757
I've heard that you're
a lowdown Yankee liar.

313
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:23,706
Shane, look out!

314
00:18:27,216 --> 00:18:30,017
From these books, I can't tell
if I'm as rich as Rockefeller

315
00:18:30,056 --> 00:18:31,354
or poor as a church mouse.

316
00:18:31,391 --> 00:18:32,723
It's not real money, Vic.

317
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:33,820
Don't worry about it.

318
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,833
Hey, it's real to me, kid.

319
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:38,133
Well, I can have the computer
put some money in your account.

320
00:18:38,205 --> 00:18:39,264
No, thanks.

321
00:18:39,307 --> 00:18:41,174
I'll figure it out.

322
00:18:43,482 --> 00:18:44,882
I got to be going on.

323
00:18:46,723 --> 00:18:48,693
Why, Shane?

324
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:51,392
Didn't he just get shot
a minute ago?

325
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:53,731
Yeah.
He took one in the arm.

326
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,296
He's not bleeding.

327
00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:56,705
He's not even in pain.

328
00:18:56,743 --> 00:18:58,645
Noggles, take it easy.
It's only a movie.

329
00:19:00,116 --> 00:19:03,988
Shane!

330
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:06,723
Come back!

331
00:19:21,224 --> 00:19:23,160
I like <i>The Searchers</i> better.

332
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,527
Yeah. Who doesn't?

333
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:25,691
Son of a gun.

334
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:27,168
I got to get ready for the show.

335
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,672
Show? I thought
we were hanging in.

336
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,074
No, "hanging out."

337
00:19:31,111 --> 00:19:33,081
And we are, except
I have a gig to do.

338
00:19:33,115 --> 00:19:34,083
Cancel it.

339
00:19:34,117 --> 00:19:35,176
I can't do that.

340
00:19:35,219 --> 00:19:36,187
Why not?

341
00:19:36,221 --> 00:19:37,189
It would be unprofessional.

342
00:19:37,256 --> 00:19:38,919
Besides, performing is my life.

343
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,121
It's what I do.

344
00:19:40,162 --> 00:19:41,460
I got to get out there
and swing.

345
00:19:41,498 --> 00:19:43,559
Otherwise, I'm just
another Clyde in a tux.

346
00:19:44,604 --> 00:19:46,471
You coming to the show?

347
00:19:48,045 --> 00:19:49,411
Sure.

348
00:19:49,447 --> 00:19:50,847
Good.

349
00:19:52,653 --> 00:19:54,680
Then, may I suggest you, uh...

350
00:19:54,725 --> 00:19:57,424
carry something
with a little more...

351
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:58,488
style?

352
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:01,993
Now, this is a cane.

353
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,371
It's a replica

354
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:05,241
of the one Errol Flynn
used to have...

355
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:07,215
only his was a little taller.

356
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,516
It's beautiful.

357
00:20:09,554 --> 00:20:12,219
It reminds me
of the Grand Nagus' staff.

358
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,250
It has a little secret.

359
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:14,888
Push that button at the back
of the head.

360
00:20:19,975 --> 00:20:21,808
Great! But what's it for?

361
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,873
You never know when a lady's
going to need a light.

362
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:25,112
Now, be careful with that stick.

363
00:20:25,152 --> 00:20:26,746
It's fragile.

364
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:28,759
It might not hold
your whole weight.

365
00:20:28,793 --> 00:20:31,663
Actually, I don't need
to put my whole weight on it.

366
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:33,692
Good.

367
00:20:33,736 --> 00:20:34,726
Now, let's get dressed.

368
00:20:34,772 --> 00:20:35,933
Tuxedos?

369
00:20:35,974 --> 00:20:38,069
You're catching on.

370
00:20:41,218 --> 00:20:43,654
I've got a song that I sing

371
00:20:43,689 --> 00:20:46,023
I can make the rain go

372
00:20:46,061 --> 00:20:49,522
Any time I move my finger

373
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:50,865
Lucky me

374
00:20:50,904 --> 00:20:53,967
Can't you see I'm in love?

375
00:20:55,246 --> 00:20:57,614
Life is a beautiful thing

376
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,748
As long as
I hold that string

377
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:05,892
I'd be a silly so-and-so

378
00:21:05,934 --> 00:21:08,531
If I should ever let it go

379
00:21:10,476 --> 00:21:13,312
I've got the world
on a string

380
00:21:13,348 --> 00:21:15,716
Sittin' on a rainbow

381
00:21:15,753 --> 00:21:18,919
Got the string around my finger

382
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,793
What a world...

383
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,663
Hey, have you seen Nog?

384
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,966
I think I see him sitting
right over there.

385
00:21:25,005 --> 00:21:25,973
All right, thanks.

386
00:21:26,007 --> 00:21:28,170
Life is a beautiful thing

387
00:21:28,211 --> 00:21:31,342
As long
as I hold that string...

388
00:21:31,384 --> 00:21:32,784
Hi, there.

389
00:21:32,821 --> 00:21:34,984
Nog, let me introduce you to...

390
00:21:35,025 --> 00:21:36,357
Down in front.

391
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:37,896
Sorry.

392
00:21:39,935 --> 00:21:42,064
Nog, this is Kesha.

393
00:21:42,106 --> 00:21:44,099
Kesha, Nog.

394
00:21:44,143 --> 00:21:45,133
Nice to meet you.

395
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,773
Welcome to Las Vegas.

396
00:21:46,816 --> 00:21:47,784
Thanks.

397
00:21:47,818 --> 00:21:49,309
...around my finger

398
00:21:49,354 --> 00:21:51,882
What a world, what a life

399
00:21:53,095 --> 00:21:55,726
What a world, what a life

400
00:21:56,801 --> 00:21:59,398
What a world, what a life

401
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,508
I'm in love.

402
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:08,450
Thank you, thank you.

403
00:22:08,492 --> 00:22:09,687
You're too kind.

404
00:22:09,727 --> 00:22:11,025
I guess that's
the response you get

405
00:22:11,064 --> 00:22:12,396
when you pack the house
with relatives.

406
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:22,485
So, uh, what
have you been doing?

407
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,285
Hanging out.

408
00:22:24,323 --> 00:22:25,382
Out of what?

409
00:22:25,459 --> 00:22:27,554
It's an expression.

410
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,261
There's a lot of
old Earth slang in this program.

411
00:22:30,302 --> 00:22:31,565
Right, daddy-o?

412
00:22:31,604 --> 00:22:33,267
Right.

413
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,608
Why don't I get us
some drinks, huh?

414
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,640
Kesha, what'll you have?

415
00:22:38,685 --> 00:22:39,778
A Makara fizz.

416
00:22:39,821 --> 00:22:41,289
They don't serve that here.

417
00:22:41,324 --> 00:22:43,419
Oh. Well, what are you having?

418
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,830
A martini. Two olives.

419
00:22:45,867 --> 00:22:47,301
I'll have the same.

420
00:22:47,336 --> 00:22:48,804
Okay. I'll be right back.

421
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,205
...Now you're here

422
00:22:50,242 --> 00:22:55,275
And now I know
just where I'm going...

423
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:56,548
Jake says you're going to be

424
00:22:56,588 --> 00:22:58,319
the first Ferengi Captain
in Starfleet.

425
00:22:58,358 --> 00:23:00,157
We'll see.

426
00:23:00,195 --> 00:23:02,529
He also says
you're quite a hero.

427
00:23:02,566 --> 00:23:04,729
I'm not a hero.

428
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,296
Don't be so modest.

429
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:07,707
Jake's not the only one.

430
00:23:07,743 --> 00:23:08,711
Everyone on the station...

431
00:23:08,745 --> 00:23:09,713
I said

432
00:23:09,747 --> 00:23:11,376
I'm not a hero.

433
00:23:11,417 --> 00:23:13,512
Okay.

434
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,724
...Now you're here

435
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:21,931
And now I know
just where I'm going

436
00:23:21,972 --> 00:23:24,067
No more doubts...

437
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,078
Which one?

438
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,080
What?

439
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:27,343
That's what you're wondering,
right?

440
00:23:27,383 --> 00:23:28,373
Which leg is it?

441
00:23:28,418 --> 00:23:30,752
Uh, no, I wasn't wondering
about that.

442
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:31,757
About what?

443
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:34,023
About your... you know...

444
00:23:34,063 --> 00:23:36,033
My new leg?

445
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:37,228
Can't you say it?

446
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:38,669
No. Yes.

447
00:23:38,705 --> 00:23:41,370
I mean, I'm not trying
to say anything.

448
00:23:41,411 --> 00:23:43,404
Then maybe
you should just keep quiet.

449
00:23:44,985 --> 00:23:46,419
Okay. Here we go.

450
00:23:46,454 --> 00:23:47,786
Three martinis.

451
00:23:47,823 --> 00:23:49,417
I think
we should leave, Jake.

452
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,894
Sounds like a good idea.

453
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,397
What's going on?

454
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:53,492
It's all my fault.

455
00:23:53,568 --> 00:23:55,002
I didn't mean to stare.

456
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:56,006
At what?

457
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,099
What do you think?

458
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,136
Oh.

459
00:24:00,182 --> 00:24:01,150
I'm really sorry

460
00:24:01,184 --> 00:24:02,260
if I made you uncomfortable,
Nog.

461
00:24:02,393 --> 00:24:03,987
Wonderful.
Good-bye.

462
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,057
Hold on.
She said she was sorry.

463
00:24:06,101 --> 00:24:07,126
I heard her.

464
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,195
Now you can go.

465
00:24:09,674 --> 00:24:11,667
Nog, what's wrong with you?

466
00:24:11,712 --> 00:24:14,343
I said get out!

467
00:24:14,384 --> 00:24:15,352
Nog...

468
00:24:15,386 --> 00:24:17,083
Let me put it another way.

469
00:24:21,365 --> 00:24:23,232
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
Break it up.

470
00:24:24,237 --> 00:24:25,205
You all right?

471
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:26,332
Yeah. I'm fine.

472
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:27,343
And you, take a hike.

473
00:24:27,377 --> 00:24:28,367
What?

474
00:24:28,412 --> 00:24:29,607
You heard me.

475
00:24:29,647 --> 00:24:31,708
You don't come into my club
and start hitting customers.

476
00:24:31,752 --> 00:24:33,118
Now, get out
before I throw you out.

477
00:24:58,605 --> 00:24:59,834
You're still up?

478
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:01,365
I couldn't sleep.

479
00:25:01,411 --> 00:25:03,472
Do you mind?

480
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,482
What a night.

481
00:25:08,525 --> 00:25:11,122
I'm sorry about what happened.

482
00:25:11,164 --> 00:25:12,359
Don't apologize to me.

483
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,891
I'm not the one you belted.

484
00:25:13,969 --> 00:25:15,563
I'll settle things with Jake.

485
00:25:15,606 --> 00:25:17,132
And his girl.

486
00:25:17,176 --> 00:25:19,078
Absolutely.

487
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:22,318
Can I go back
to the club tomorrow night?

488
00:25:22,353 --> 00:25:23,343
I can't have you

489
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:24,356
hitting the customers.

490
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,358
It's not good for business.

491
00:25:25,392 --> 00:25:28,887
I promise it'll
never happen again.

492
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,107
What got into you, anyway?

493
00:25:34,143 --> 00:25:35,669
I don't know.

494
00:25:35,713 --> 00:25:39,619
She started calling me
a hero, and...

495
00:25:39,654 --> 00:25:42,353
things just went
downhill from there.

496
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:44,329
She called you a hero

497
00:25:44,364 --> 00:25:45,855
and for that you slugged
your best friend?

498
00:25:47,236 --> 00:25:49,468
Remind me never to give
you a compliment.

499
00:25:54,384 --> 00:25:56,752
You know, I'm beat.

500
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,985
That's never happened to me.

501
00:25:59,093 --> 00:26:00,687
What?

502
00:26:00,729 --> 00:26:02,358
Being tired.

503
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,597
My program's never run
this long.

504
00:26:04,637 --> 00:26:07,939
Usually people come in,
ask for a song or two...

505
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,604
sometimes a night on the town...

506
00:26:09,647 --> 00:26:11,844
but I never have to put in
a full day.

507
00:26:11,885 --> 00:26:13,946
Maybe you should go to bed.

508
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,686
I got work to do.

509
00:26:15,726 --> 00:26:18,391
If I don't get
these books in order

510
00:26:18,432 --> 00:26:20,629
Uncle Sam's going
to come down on me

511
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:22,696
like a ton of bricks.

512
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,208
Sounds like my uncle.

513
00:26:24,243 --> 00:26:26,270
Is there anything I can do?

514
00:26:26,314 --> 00:26:27,977
You know anything
about bookkeeping?

515
00:26:28,017 --> 00:26:29,611
I'm a Ferengi.

516
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:31,145
It's in our blood.

517
00:26:36,735 --> 00:26:38,762
Be my guest.

518
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:39,966
Where's your computer?

519
00:26:40,008 --> 00:26:41,237
Right here.

520
00:26:41,277 --> 00:26:42,940
It's 1962.

521
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,246
What do you want from me?

522
00:26:45,285 --> 00:26:47,414
It's all right.
I can do it this way.

523
00:26:47,456 --> 00:26:49,688
I'm going to hit the sack.

524
00:26:52,266 --> 00:26:53,963
Can I ask you a question, Vic?

525
00:26:54,002 --> 00:26:56,268
Sure.

526
00:26:56,307 --> 00:26:57,775
When you sleep...

527
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:00,110
do you dream?

528
00:27:01,951 --> 00:27:03,385
Good night, kid.

529
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:06,788
Good night, Vic.

530
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,904
So, when Dino goes in
to pick up his robe

531
00:27:15,946 --> 00:27:17,380
he doesn't realize
that across the back

532
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:19,579
Frank has printed in
big bold letters...

533
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,022
I'll finish the story later.

534
00:27:22,092 --> 00:27:23,287
Hi, dollface.

535
00:27:23,328 --> 00:27:24,353
Hi.

536
00:27:24,397 --> 00:27:25,365
Where's Nog?

537
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:26,367
Up in the room...

538
00:27:26,401 --> 00:27:27,835
still working on
the receipts from '61.

539
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,031
That kid's a hell
of an accountant.

540
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,939
He said the government
owes me money.

541
00:27:30,976 --> 00:27:32,035
Can you believe that?

542
00:27:32,078 --> 00:27:34,446
I need to talk to him.

543
00:27:34,484 --> 00:27:35,452
Can it wait?

544
00:27:35,486 --> 00:27:37,012
I'm afraid not.

545
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,048
It's about that thing
with Jake, right?

546
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,059
Is he pressing charges?

547
00:27:40,162 --> 00:27:42,827
No. But I do think
that it's time for Nog

548
00:27:42,867 --> 00:27:44,393
to leave the holosuite.

549
00:27:44,437 --> 00:27:45,564
Wait-wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

550
00:27:45,606 --> 00:27:47,542
He likes it here.
He's making progress.

551
00:27:47,576 --> 00:27:49,307
Okay, he lost his cool.

552
00:27:49,347 --> 00:27:50,747
But I don't think
that'll happen again.

553
00:27:50,783 --> 00:27:54,244
Vic, he can't hide
in here forever.

554
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,989
He has to face reality sometime.

555
00:27:57,028 --> 00:27:58,827
The kid's had too much
reality lately

556
00:27:58,865 --> 00:28:00,026
if you ask me.

557
00:28:00,067 --> 00:28:01,057
He's lost a leg.

558
00:28:01,103 --> 00:28:03,039
He's watched good friends die.

559
00:28:03,073 --> 00:28:04,439
Like you said,
we shouldn't push him.

560
00:28:04,477 --> 00:28:06,208
He needs time to heal.

561
00:28:07,249 --> 00:28:10,346
No offense, but you're
just a hologram

562
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:11,357
and I am his counselor.

563
00:28:11,391 --> 00:28:12,654
I outrank you

564
00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:15,290
and I feel that it's
time for him to go.

565
00:28:15,332 --> 00:28:16,595
He's on medical leave

566
00:28:16,634 --> 00:28:18,763
and according
to Starfleet Regulations

567
00:28:18,805 --> 00:28:20,968
he can spend it
wherever he chooses.

568
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:23,275
How do you know that?

569
00:28:23,315 --> 00:28:24,544
I told him.

570
00:28:24,584 --> 00:28:26,986
And if you try
to force me to leave

571
00:28:27,021 --> 00:28:28,581
I'll resign my commission.

572
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:29,854
Wait a minute.

573
00:28:29,894 --> 00:28:31,226
Let's slow down here.

574
00:28:31,264 --> 00:28:33,359
No one's talking about
forcing anyone to do anything.

575
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:34,892
Good.

576
00:28:34,937 --> 00:28:36,770
Because Vic and I
have big plans.

577
00:28:36,808 --> 00:28:38,641
We do?

578
00:28:38,678 --> 00:28:39,941
I've been going
over your books,

579
00:28:39,981 --> 00:28:41,244
and this place
is a latinum mine

580
00:28:41,284 --> 00:28:42,343
and you don't even know it.

581
00:28:42,386 --> 00:28:44,049
In my opinion

582
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:46,116
it's time to expand
the business.

583
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,858
Nog, this is a holosuite.

584
00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:50,630
Of course it's a holosuite.

585
00:28:50,669 --> 00:28:54,769
But that doesn't mean
we can't build a new casino.

586
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:57,007
A new casino?

587
00:28:57,048 --> 00:28:58,711
How much money do I have?

588
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,745
If you'll excuse us,
Counselor.

589
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:02,782
We have business to conduct.

590
00:29:18,525 --> 00:29:21,691
Say, it's only a paper moon

591
00:29:21,731 --> 00:29:25,262
Sailing over a cardboard sea

592
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:28,368
But it wouldn't be
make-believe

593
00:29:28,411 --> 00:29:31,577
If you believed in me

594
00:29:32,586 --> 00:29:36,754
Now it's only a canvas sky

595
00:29:36,794 --> 00:29:39,425
Hanging over a muslin tree

596
00:29:39,467 --> 00:29:42,701
But it wouldn't be
make-believe

597
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,110
If you believed in me

598
00:29:46,146 --> 00:29:49,482
Without your love

599
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,460
It's a honky-tonk parade

600
00:29:53,495 --> 00:29:56,365
Without your love

601
00:29:56,401 --> 00:30:00,739
It's a melody played
in a penny arcade

602
00:30:00,776 --> 00:30:04,180
It's a Barnum & Bailey
world

603
00:30:04,215 --> 00:30:07,619
Just as phony as it can be

604
00:30:07,656 --> 00:30:10,560
But it wouldn't be
make-believe

605
00:30:10,595 --> 00:30:14,433
If you believed in me

606
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:17,601
Without your love

607
00:30:17,643 --> 00:30:21,174
It's a honky-tonk parade

608
00:30:21,216 --> 00:30:24,347
Without your love

609
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:28,923
It's a melody played
in a penny arcade

610
00:30:28,965 --> 00:30:32,199
It's a Barnum & Bailey
world

611
00:30:32,238 --> 00:30:35,540
Just as phony as it can be

612
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:38,415
But it wouldn't be
make-believe

613
00:30:38,451 --> 00:30:41,651
If you believed in me

614
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:45,595
No, it wouldn't be
make-believe

615
00:30:45,632 --> 00:30:51,041
If you believed in me.

616
00:31:04,302 --> 00:31:06,169
Go easy on the garnishes.

617
00:31:06,206 --> 00:31:07,174
People order a drink

618
00:31:07,208 --> 00:31:08,871
they don't want
a fruit bowl in the glass.

619
00:31:08,912 --> 00:31:11,144
We'll talk about this later.

620
00:31:11,183 --> 00:31:12,151
Okay.

621
00:31:12,185 --> 00:31:13,153
Good evening.

622
00:31:13,187 --> 00:31:14,655
I'll take care of them.

623
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:16,124
Hey, long time no see.

624
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,890
Oh, Nog.

625
00:31:20,034 --> 00:31:21,799
Right this way.

626
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:33,921
So... how are you?

627
00:31:33,962 --> 00:31:34,952
Couldn't be better.

628
00:31:34,997 --> 00:31:36,158
Business is booming.

629
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:38,101
We're making money
hand over fist.

630
00:31:38,136 --> 00:31:40,231
I can hardly keep up with
all the profits.

631
00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:42,837
Those are holographic
profits, right?

632
00:31:42,879 --> 00:31:44,245
Yeah.

633
00:31:44,282 --> 00:31:46,479
So, what's new with you?

634
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,353
Well...

635
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:50,690
Rom got a promotion.

636
00:31:50,729 --> 00:31:53,165
Maintenance Engineer
First Class.

637
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,760
That's great!

638
00:31:54,803 --> 00:31:56,135
Congratulations, Dad.

639
00:31:56,172 --> 00:31:58,142
Thanks.

640
00:31:58,176 --> 00:31:59,610
We should celebrate.

641
00:31:59,647 --> 00:32:00,672
We'll close the lounge.

642
00:32:00,715 --> 00:32:02,275
Have a private party...

643
00:32:02,318 --> 00:32:07,283
Actually, Chief O'Brien
threw him a party last night.

644
00:32:07,328 --> 00:32:08,421
Oh.

645
00:32:08,464 --> 00:32:10,331
It was a spur-of-the-moment
thing.

646
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:12,633
No invitations or anything.

647
00:32:12,673 --> 00:32:14,199
Don't worry about it.

648
00:32:14,242 --> 00:32:15,802
I probably couldn't
have gotten away.

649
00:32:15,845 --> 00:32:17,906
Last night was really busy.

650
00:32:17,949 --> 00:32:21,319
Uh-oh. Big player
just walked in.

651
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,483
Excuse me a minute.

652
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:24,155
I need to go schmooze.

653
00:32:24,195 --> 00:32:25,789
Okay.

654
00:32:25,832 --> 00:32:27,597
See you later.

655
00:32:27,636 --> 00:32:29,401
Bye.

656
00:32:31,209 --> 00:32:33,372
Hey, I hope you're
still talking to me.

657
00:32:33,413 --> 00:32:35,781
Of course I am.

658
00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:39,052
I got to hand it to you, Vic.

659
00:32:39,092 --> 00:32:40,686
You've done a great
job with him.

660
00:32:40,729 --> 00:32:42,197
He seems like a new man.

661
00:32:42,231 --> 00:32:44,964
He just needed
a little time, that's all.

662
00:32:45,003 --> 00:32:46,939
Heals all wounds, right?

663
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:50,246
Giving him that cane
was a great idea.

664
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,543
I haven't seen him
limp in days.

665
00:32:51,584 --> 00:32:52,745
It gets better.

666
00:32:52,786 --> 00:32:54,949
Yesterday, we drove out
to see the architect

667
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,516
who's designing
the new casino.

668
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,792
I saw him actually
run up a flight of stairs.

669
00:32:58,831 --> 00:32:59,992
No kidding?

670
00:33:00,033 --> 00:33:01,331
Would I kid a kidder?

671
00:33:02,572 --> 00:33:04,269
So what's next for you two?

672
00:33:04,308 --> 00:33:07,907
Ah... we don't break ground
on the casino for about a week

673
00:33:07,949 --> 00:33:10,385
so I thought we'd fly up
to Tahoe for a couple of days.

674
00:33:10,487 --> 00:33:12,616
Sammy's going to be performing
at the Cal-Neva

675
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,561
and I thought I'd introduce
the kid to him.

676
00:33:14,596 --> 00:33:15,825
Sammy's a friend of yours?

677
00:33:15,865 --> 00:33:17,333
Yeah. We're tight.

678
00:33:19,138 --> 00:33:20,629
I see.

679
00:33:20,675 --> 00:33:22,235
You're going to get
Sammy to convince him

680
00:33:22,278 --> 00:33:24,339
that it's time to
leave the holosuite.

681
00:33:25,384 --> 00:33:26,818
Well... no...

682
00:33:26,854 --> 00:33:28,254
Forget it.

683
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,553
I should know better by now

684
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:31,688
than to ask you to give
away your secrets.

685
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:34,395
You probably have the
whole thing mapped out.

686
00:33:34,435 --> 00:33:35,528
I mean, what am I thinking?

687
00:33:35,572 --> 00:33:38,442
That this new casino
is anything more than a ploy?

688
00:33:38,477 --> 00:33:39,968
That you'd actually let him

689
00:33:40,013 --> 00:33:42,541
live out the rest of
his life in a holosuite?

690
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,047
No.

691
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,183
Of course not.

692
00:33:46,226 --> 00:33:47,194
I mean...

693
00:33:47,228 --> 00:33:49,562
the casino's just a...
just a ploy

694
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,331
like you said, you know.

695
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:55,412
They'll be so glad
to have him back.

696
00:33:55,545 --> 00:33:56,672
Yeah.

697
00:33:56,714 --> 00:33:59,207
He is better, isn't he?

698
00:33:59,252 --> 00:34:00,515
It's like you said...

699
00:34:00,555 --> 00:34:02,821
he just needed a
break from reality.

700
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,853
Now all that's left
is to decide

701
00:34:04,897 --> 00:34:06,628
when he's ready to go back.

702
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:10,337
But I'll leave that up to you.

703
00:34:10,374 --> 00:34:12,071
See you around.

704
00:34:12,111 --> 00:34:13,671
See ya.

705
00:34:31,116 --> 00:34:32,949
Great set tonight, Vic.

706
00:34:33,053 --> 00:34:34,180
Thanks.

707
00:34:34,222 --> 00:34:36,887
Lots of familiar
faces in the crowd.

708
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:39,330
Did I see Rom
and Leeta out there?

709
00:34:39,365 --> 00:34:40,959
They came for a while.

710
00:34:41,069 --> 00:34:43,369
What do you think about
moving the crap tables

711
00:34:43,407 --> 00:34:45,206
over to the south wing

712
00:34:45,244 --> 00:34:48,945
and expanding the slot
machines out into here?

713
00:34:48,985 --> 00:34:50,180
Good idea.

714
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:52,990
I'll think it over.

715
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,087
But we're supposed
to meet with the architect

716
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,393
tomorrow morning.

717
00:34:56,433 --> 00:34:57,662
Not anymore.

718
00:34:57,703 --> 00:34:59,001
It's time for you to go, kid.

719
00:34:59,072 --> 00:35:00,438
Go where?

720
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:01,703
You know where.

721
00:35:01,744 --> 00:35:04,044
It's time to end the program.

722
00:35:05,551 --> 00:35:06,849
But we've got work to do.

723
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:07,946
We have a casino to build.

724
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,960
No, we don't.

725
00:35:09,994 --> 00:35:11,520
This is just a fantasy.

726
00:35:11,563 --> 00:35:13,590
It's not real.

727
00:35:13,635 --> 00:35:15,935
It's real to me
and it's real to you

728
00:35:15,972 --> 00:35:17,304
and don't say it isn't.

729
00:35:17,341 --> 00:35:18,309
I know better.

730
00:35:18,343 --> 00:35:19,572
You're right.

731
00:35:19,612 --> 00:35:21,241
It's very real to me.

732
00:35:22,351 --> 00:35:23,945
But I'm a hologram, Nog.

733
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:25,719
I'm not a person.

734
00:35:25,759 --> 00:35:27,854
Until you came along,
I'd never been on

735
00:35:27,896 --> 00:35:30,196
for more than six or
seven hours straight.

736
00:35:30,234 --> 00:35:31,202
I know.

737
00:35:31,236 --> 00:35:33,103
And now you're
running all the time.

738
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,369
Isn't it great?

739
00:35:37,314 --> 00:35:38,908
It's incredible.

740
00:35:40,554 --> 00:35:41,852
Since you've been here

741
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:45,422
I've slept in a bed every night,
gone to work every day...

742
00:35:45,464 --> 00:35:48,197
had time to read the paper,
play cards with the boys.

743
00:35:48,236 --> 00:35:49,363
I've had a life

744
00:35:49,405 --> 00:35:51,238
and I have to tell you

745
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:52,802
it's a precious thing.

746
00:35:52,846 --> 00:35:57,048
I had no idea how much
it means to just... live.

747
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:59,649
And now I'm going
to return the favor

748
00:35:59,693 --> 00:36:01,629
and give you your life back.

749
00:36:04,903 --> 00:36:08,000
But I don't want that life
anymore, Vic.

750
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,841
I'm perfectly happy here.

751
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,939
What "here"?

752
00:36:10,982 --> 00:36:12,679
There is no "here."

753
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:14,655
Don't you get it?
This is nowhere.

754
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,626
It's an illusion and so am I.

755
00:36:16,659 --> 00:36:19,027
In fact, the only thing
in this entire program

756
00:36:19,098 --> 00:36:20,532
that is not an illusion
is you.

757
00:36:20,567 --> 00:36:23,403
Okay. You're right...

758
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,039
but I'm not ready
to go back yet.

759
00:36:27,114 --> 00:36:28,879
I need more time.

760
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:33,551
So let's just sleep on this

761
00:36:33,593 --> 00:36:35,358
and talk about it tomorrow.

762
00:36:35,397 --> 00:36:36,797
Kid...

763
00:36:36,834 --> 00:36:39,533
I hate to do this to you

764
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,667
but you're not giving
me any choice.

765
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,973
Computer...

766
00:36:43,013 --> 00:36:43,878
No! Don't!

767
00:36:43,915 --> 00:36:45,714
End program.

768
00:37:00,614 --> 00:37:01,912
Oh, hi, Nog.

769
00:37:01,951 --> 00:37:02,919
Chief.

770
00:37:02,953 --> 00:37:04,251
Something wrong?

771
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:06,588
No, no. I, uh...
I was running

772
00:37:06,626 --> 00:37:08,152
a diagnostic in Ops

773
00:37:08,196 --> 00:37:09,562
and I noticed
a magnetic flux anomaly

774
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,332
in the holosuite
transilluminator circuits.

775
00:37:12,371 --> 00:37:13,634
I didn't realize it was you.

776
00:37:13,673 --> 00:37:15,164
Sorry.

777
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,371
I'm just having trouble

778
00:37:16,412 --> 00:37:18,507
getting the Las Vegas
program to run.

779
00:37:20,654 --> 00:37:22,088
You know...

780
00:37:22,124 --> 00:37:24,356
Vic's matrix is
a little different

781
00:37:24,395 --> 00:37:27,299
than your standard
photokinetic hologram.

782
00:37:27,334 --> 00:37:30,101
He can turn himself off.

783
00:37:31,944 --> 00:37:33,105
And if he doesn't
want to appear

784
00:37:33,213 --> 00:37:34,112
he doesn't appear.

785
00:37:34,215 --> 00:37:35,649
You mean, he has free will?

786
00:37:35,684 --> 00:37:38,120
Hey, I'm an engineer,
not a philosopher.

787
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:42,459
All I know is, that when Vic
turns himself off, he's off

788
00:37:42,498 --> 00:37:44,559
and ripping out the
guts of the holosuite

789
00:37:44,602 --> 00:37:46,036
isn't going to change that.

790
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,414
Anything else I can do for you?

791
00:37:52,451 --> 00:37:53,817
No.

792
00:37:57,161 --> 00:38:00,361
Oh, we, uh... we all
miss you in Ops.

793
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,698
Yeah.

794
00:38:05,077 --> 00:38:06,637
So...

795
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:08,113
now that the Chief's told you

796
00:38:08,183 --> 00:38:09,812
I'm smarter
than the average bear

797
00:38:09,853 --> 00:38:11,948
will you stop messing around
with my holosuite?

798
00:38:11,991 --> 00:38:13,927
If you turn the program back on.

799
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:16,728
What is it I'm not making
clear to you, Charlie?

800
00:38:16,766 --> 00:38:17,756
You got to go.

801
00:38:19,305 --> 00:38:21,502
Don't you get it?

802
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:23,478
I can't go out there.

803
00:38:23,513 --> 00:38:25,608
Why not?

804
00:38:27,922 --> 00:38:30,154
I'm scared... okay?

805
00:38:30,193 --> 00:38:32,026
I'm scared.

806
00:38:38,978 --> 00:38:41,175
When the war began...

807
00:38:41,215 --> 00:38:44,051
I wasn't happy or anything

808
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,558
but I was eager.

809
00:38:48,263 --> 00:38:50,860
I wanted to test myself.

810
00:38:50,902 --> 00:38:55,810
I wanted to prove I had
what it took to be a soldier

811
00:38:55,845 --> 00:38:59,306
and I saw a lot of combat.

812
00:38:59,351 --> 00:39:01,948
I saw a lot of people get hurt.

813
00:39:04,228 --> 00:39:06,859
I saw a lot of people die

814
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,631
but I didn't think

815
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,606
anything was going
to happen to me

816
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,040
and then, suddenly

817
00:39:12,077 --> 00:39:16,712
Dr. Bashir is telling me
he has to cut my leg off.

818
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,917
I couldn't believe it.

819
00:39:20,962 --> 00:39:24,093
I still can't believe it.

820
00:39:24,135 --> 00:39:29,043
If I can get shot,
if I can lose my leg

821
00:39:29,078 --> 00:39:31,845
anything can happen to me, Vic.

822
00:39:31,884 --> 00:39:34,286
I could die tomorrow.

823
00:39:36,894 --> 00:39:39,330
I don't know
if I'm ready to face that.

824
00:39:43,974 --> 00:39:47,778
If I stay here, at least I know

825
00:39:47,814 --> 00:39:50,284
what the future
is going to be like.

826
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:55,053
You stay here,
you're going to die

827
00:39:55,096 --> 00:39:59,161
not all at once,
but little by little.

828
00:39:59,205 --> 00:40:02,439
Eventually, you'll become
as hollow as I am.

829
00:40:03,981 --> 00:40:05,883
You don't seem hollow to me.

830
00:40:05,918 --> 00:40:08,617
Compared to you,
I'm hollow as a snare drum.

831
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,287
Look, kid, I don't
know what's going

832
00:40:11,329 --> 00:40:12,889
to happen to you out there.

833
00:40:12,932 --> 00:40:14,993
All I can tell you is that...

834
00:40:15,036 --> 00:40:18,065
you've got to play
the cards life deals you.

835
00:40:18,109 --> 00:40:21,377
Sometimes you win,
sometimes you lose.

836
00:40:22,884 --> 00:40:24,911
But at least you're in the game.

837
00:40:59,258 --> 00:41:00,487
Crazy.

838
00:41:01,429 --> 00:41:02,989
He seemed happy.

839
00:41:03,032 --> 00:41:05,059
And he's stopped limping.

840
00:41:05,103 --> 00:41:06,162
You're joking.

841
00:41:06,205 --> 00:41:08,141
No. He's a new man.

842
00:41:08,176 --> 00:41:09,702
You should go see him.

843
00:41:09,745 --> 00:41:12,113
I don't think I'll need to.

844
00:41:21,102 --> 00:41:23,903
- Hi.
- Hi.

845
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,933
Are you okay?

846
00:41:25,977 --> 00:41:28,243
No...

847
00:41:28,282 --> 00:41:29,979
but I will be.

848
00:41:50,827 --> 00:41:53,799
Computer, run program Bashir 62.

849
00:41:58,109 --> 00:41:59,840
Hi, kid.

850
00:41:59,878 --> 00:42:01,107
Hey, nice threads.

851
00:42:01,148 --> 00:42:02,116
Thanks.

852
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,118
You back at work?

853
00:42:03,152 --> 00:42:05,384
Limited duty.

854
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,788
Just a couple hours a day.

855
00:42:06,826 --> 00:42:08,158
How's it feel?

856
00:42:08,196 --> 00:42:10,098
Different.

857
00:42:10,133 --> 00:42:11,396
I feel older.

858
00:42:11,502 --> 00:42:13,870
Happens to the best of us.

859
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:16,537
I want to thank you
for all that you did for me.

860
00:42:16,579 --> 00:42:18,208
That's not necessary.

861
00:42:18,249 --> 00:42:20,082
You did something for me, too.

862
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:21,087
You gave me a chance

863
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,784
to see what it's like
to have a life.

864
00:42:22,824 --> 00:42:24,885
Well, you're going to
have that chance again.

865
00:42:24,928 --> 00:42:26,761
I've made arrangements
with my Uncle Quark

866
00:42:26,799 --> 00:42:28,165
to keep your program running

867
00:42:28,202 --> 00:42:30,604
26 hours a day from now on.

868
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,108
What?

869
00:42:32,143 --> 00:42:33,577
It's my gift to you.

870
00:42:33,613 --> 00:42:37,644
Kid... I don't know
what to say.

871
00:42:37,687 --> 00:42:39,816
Just put it there, pally

872
00:42:39,858 --> 00:42:42,294
and tell me you'll always
save a seat for me up front.

873
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:45,461
It's a deal, and you
can take that to the bank.

874
00:42:46,972 --> 00:42:47,962
Got to go.

875
00:42:48,008 --> 00:42:49,875
I'm buying Jake and
Kesha dinner tonight.

876
00:42:49,912 --> 00:42:50,880
Hey.

877
00:42:50,914 --> 00:42:52,850
Try not to overturn
the furniture.

878
00:42:52,884 --> 00:42:54,513
I'll try.

879
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,672
26 hours a day?

880
00:43:09,518 --> 00:43:12,888
I've got the world on string

881
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,757
Sittin' on a rainbow

882
00:43:14,795 --> 00:43:18,860
Got the string
around my finger

883
00:43:18,903 --> 00:43:20,303
What a world

884
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,308
What a life

885
00:43:21,342 --> 00:43:23,141
I'm in love

886
00:43:24,715 --> 00:43:27,448
I've got a song
that I sing

887
00:43:27,487 --> 00:43:29,719
I can make the rain go

888
00:43:29,758 --> 00:43:33,219
Anytime I move my finger

889
00:43:33,265 --> 00:43:34,928
Lucky me

890
00:43:34,968 --> 00:43:36,494
Can't you see

891
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:37,870
I'm in love?

892
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:41,573
Life is a beautiful thing

893
00:43:42,817 --> 00:43:45,448
As long as I hold
that string

894
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:49,692
I'd be a silly so-and-so

895
00:43:49,731 --> 00:43:52,999
If I should ever let it go

896
00:43:54,307 --> 00:43:57,302
I've got
the world on a string

897
00:43:57,347 --> 00:43:59,408
Sittin' on a rainbow

898
00:43:59,451 --> 00:44:03,289
Got the string
around my finger

899
00:44:03,325 --> 00:44:04,418
What a world

900
00:44:04,461 --> 00:44:06,055
What a life

901
00:44:06,097 --> 00:44:07,360
I'm in love

902
00:44:08,803 --> 00:44:11,205
Life is a beautiful thing...
