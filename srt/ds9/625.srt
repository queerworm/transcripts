1
00:00:06,474 --> 00:00:09,470
All right, these barstools
will have to be removed.

2
00:00:09,514 --> 00:00:11,348
Do you know how much they cost?

3
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:14,188
No, and I can't say
I'm interested in learning.

4
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:16,492
Station Regulation 2562,
paragraph four:

5
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:19,129
"All furniture intended
for use on the Promenade

6
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:21,404
must not pose a danger
to public safety."

7
00:00:21,443 --> 00:00:22,411
What danger?

8
00:00:22,445 --> 00:00:23,573
Without a back on the stool

9
00:00:23,615 --> 00:00:25,107
Morn could tumble from his perch

10
00:00:25,152 --> 00:00:27,350
at any moment, shattering
his upper vertebrae

11
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,486
or puncturing three
or four of his lungs.

12
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,554
Nonsense.

13
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:32,762
His body weight is
perfectly distributed

14
00:00:32,804 --> 00:00:33,898
across the seat.

15
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:36,537
He's also better able
to enjoy the view

16
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:37,673
of the lovely dabo girls

17
00:00:37,716 --> 00:00:38,741
than he was before

18
00:00:38,784 --> 00:00:41,518
and should he require
another drink

19
00:00:41,558 --> 00:00:43,791
he need only spin back.

20
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,595
Which points out
another danger...

21
00:00:45,634 --> 00:00:46,624
vertigo.

22
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,133
This isn't going
to give anybody vertigo.

23
00:00:51,348 --> 00:00:53,478
Your appeal has been
heard and rejected.

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,787
I want the barstools removed
by the end of the day.

25
00:00:55,825 --> 00:00:57,796
Now, it's come to my attention

26
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,767
that your dabo wheel
is in violation

27
00:00:59,802 --> 00:01:03,072
of Station Regulation 4721,
which states...

28
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:04,077
Odo.

29
00:01:04,112 --> 00:01:05,102
Nerys.

30
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,412
You busy?

31
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:07,476
Not at all.

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,750
Well, then can I interest you

33
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:09,758
in some lunch?

34
00:01:09,793 --> 00:01:10,783
Where shall we go?

35
00:01:10,828 --> 00:01:12,457
I was thinking
about the Klingon restaurant.

36
00:01:12,498 --> 00:01:14,594
I haven't been there for ages,
and I have been craving

37
00:01:14,637 --> 00:01:16,505
broiled krada legs.

38
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,271
Too bad about the barstools.

39
00:01:19,315 --> 00:01:20,477
I kind of liked them.

40
00:01:20,518 --> 00:01:22,283
Did you notice how he changed

41
00:01:22,355 --> 00:01:24,120
the minute she walked
into the room?

42
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,960
They're in love.

43
00:01:25,997 --> 00:01:26,965
And what's love?

44
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,968
Well, it's a...

45
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:29,905
Love's a distraction.

46
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:33,643
And a distracted policeman is...

47
00:01:33,683 --> 00:01:35,209
an opportunity.

48
00:01:38,126 --> 00:01:42,466
Captain's Log, Stardate 51948.3.

49
00:01:42,504 --> 00:01:43,666
With the safe arrival

50
00:01:43,707 --> 00:01:46,042
of Convey PQ-1
in the Vegan system

51
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,810
our escort duties
are now complete

52
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,342
and I've set course for home.

53
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,117
Well, my first and hopefully

54
00:01:51,157 --> 00:01:53,789
last mission report
for Starfleet Command.

55
00:01:53,831 --> 00:01:57,363
You know, when I first agreed
to be Convoy Liaison Officer

56
00:01:57,473 --> 00:01:58,908
I thought, "Sure, why not?

57
00:01:58,943 --> 00:02:01,380
"I know most of the freighter
captains in the convoy.

58
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:02,715
It should be a piece of cake."

59
00:02:02,753 --> 00:02:05,054
I didn't know I'd be making
20 log entries

60
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:08,327
a day and filling out
formal reports every night.

61
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,337
Looks like you did
a pretty good job.

62
00:02:10,404 --> 00:02:13,036
Well, if you're going
to do something, do it right.

63
00:02:13,077 --> 00:02:14,774
That's what my father
used to say.

64
00:02:14,814 --> 00:02:17,081
Every father says that.

65
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,318
Even I say that.

66
00:02:19,359 --> 00:02:21,056
That's why you're a good parent.

67
00:02:21,096 --> 00:02:23,294
You know
all the clichés by heart.

68
00:02:24,738 --> 00:02:25,934
Well, hello, stranger.

69
00:02:25,975 --> 00:02:27,103
Haven't seen you in days.

70
00:02:27,144 --> 00:02:30,083
I've been filling out reports
for Starfleet Medical.

71
00:02:30,118 --> 00:02:32,112
I knew there was a reason
why I didn't join Starfleet.

72
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:34,627
I-I, I couldn't do
this paperwork.

73
00:02:34,662 --> 00:02:36,325
Smart.

74
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:39,339
Well, there was a time

75
00:02:39,374 --> 00:02:40,809
when you couldn't get him
to shut up.

76
00:02:40,844 --> 00:02:43,247
I think I like him
better this way.

77
00:02:43,282 --> 00:02:44,410
That's mean.

78
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,011
I was just kidding.

79
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:48,995
No. You weren't.

80
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,431
Worf to Captain Sisko.

81
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:52,231
Sisko here.

82
00:02:52,271 --> 00:02:54,242
Sir, can you come to the Bridge?

83
00:02:54,276 --> 00:02:55,575
We have picked up
a distress call.

84
00:02:55,613 --> 00:02:57,207
On my way.

85
00:03:08,142 --> 00:03:09,338
We have been unable

86
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:11,612
to establish two-way
communication so far

87
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:13,747
but we have determined
that the signal's coming

88
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:16,056
from somewhere
in the Rutharian sector.

89
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,929
Let's hear it, Chief.

90
00:03:20,605 --> 00:03:22,439
...and Commander Gatsby's
dead, too.

91
00:03:22,477 --> 00:03:24,448
I didn't see
any other escape pods leave

92
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:28,447
before the ship was destroyed,
so I may be the only survivor.

93
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:33,093
My pod was torn open on impact
and the rain is pouring in.

94
00:03:33,136 --> 00:03:35,300
I'll take the radio
and a survival kit with me

95
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:37,175
but the environmental suits
were damaged

96
00:03:37,212 --> 00:03:39,581
in the crash,
so I-I'll have to rough it.

97
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:41,452
This is an L-Class world

98
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:44,656
and the atmosphere
is barely breathable out there.

99
00:03:44,696 --> 00:03:48,501
Repeat: This is
a general distress call.

100
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,513
I am a citizen of the
United Federation of Planets

101
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,015
and a Starfleet officer.

102
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,317
If you can hear me,
please respond.

103
00:03:55,355 --> 00:03:58,693
My government will reward you
for any assistance you can offer

104
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,862
and most of all,
you'll be my personal heroes.

105
00:04:01,904 --> 00:04:02,872
Repeat...

106
00:04:02,907 --> 00:04:04,433
That's enough.

107
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:05,912
This is a general...

108
00:04:05,948 --> 00:04:08,419
How long will it take us
to reach her?

109
00:04:08,453 --> 00:04:11,255
At maximum warp, six days.

110
00:04:12,563 --> 00:04:14,363
Any other ships
closer to that sector?

111
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:16,098
No, sir.

112
00:04:16,138 --> 00:04:19,374
Mr. Worf, turn us around

113
00:04:19,413 --> 00:04:22,045
and set a course
for the Rutharian sector.

114
00:04:22,086 --> 00:04:23,111
Aye, sir.

115
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:28,425
Chief, I want you to establish

116
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,462
a two-way com link
with this woman

117
00:04:30,506 --> 00:04:34,846
and when you do, tell her...

118
00:04:34,883 --> 00:04:37,856
tell her
her "heroes" are on the way.

119
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,007
Captain's Log, supplemental.

120
00:06:39,043 --> 00:06:41,344
The marooned Starfleet officer,

121
00:06:41,382 --> 00:06:42,783
whose name we've learned
is Lisa

122
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:44,789
continues to transmit
her call for help

123
00:06:44,823 --> 00:06:47,260
but so far Chief O'Brien
has been unable

124
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,855
to establish
two-way communication.

125
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,426
How's it going?

126
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,438
Slow.

127
00:06:51,472 --> 00:06:53,375
For some reason,
she's transmitting

128
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:55,211
on a rotating
subspace frequency.

129
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,239
We're having a problem

130
00:06:56,284 --> 00:06:58,187
trying to find a way
to return her signal.

131
00:06:58,222 --> 00:06:59,953
Do you have to keep that on
all the time?

132
00:06:59,993 --> 00:07:02,157
No, not really.

133
00:07:02,198 --> 00:07:03,827
But she is all alone.

134
00:07:03,869 --> 00:07:06,033
The least I can do
is try and listen to her.

135
00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:08,137
She doesn't know
you're listening, Miles.

136
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,151
You're not comforting her
by keeping the channels open

137
00:07:10,184 --> 00:07:11,619
and driving yourself crazy.

138
00:07:11,654 --> 00:07:13,089
It doesn't bother me.

139
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,962
Sometimes it feels like
she's actually talking to me.

140
00:07:15,998 --> 00:07:17,160
...for any assistance you can...

141
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:18,169
It's true.

142
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:19,571
Especially when she talks

143
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:21,270
about her home or her family.

144
00:07:21,344 --> 00:07:23,281
She reminds me of my cousin.

145
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:24,682
Oh, no!

146
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:26,690
I don't believe it.

147
00:07:26,724 --> 00:07:28,250
It's raining again.

148
00:07:28,294 --> 00:07:30,424
How can there be so much water
and so little life out there?

149
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:32,596
I think
I'll leave you two alone.

150
00:07:32,638 --> 00:07:34,836
I'm really starting
to hate this place.

151
00:07:34,877 --> 00:07:38,648
Repeat, this is
a general distress call.

152
00:07:38,685 --> 00:07:41,487
Hello?
Is anyone paying attention?

153
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:42,995
I know you're out there.

154
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,555
I know you can hear me.

155
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,331
So just answer me.

156
00:07:46,404 --> 00:07:48,238
Tell me you're on your way.

157
00:07:48,276 --> 00:07:50,577
Tell me I'm going to be rescued.

158
00:07:50,614 --> 00:07:52,915
Tell me
I'm not going to die alone.

159
00:08:03,345 --> 00:08:05,612
I hope you're satisfied.

160
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,621
I'm sure nothing
gives you more pleasure

161
00:08:08,657 --> 00:08:10,251
than stifling my creativity.

162
00:08:11,297 --> 00:08:13,564
Only you would
consider barstools

163
00:08:13,603 --> 00:08:16,201
to be a form
of artistic expression.

164
00:08:16,243 --> 00:08:17,211
Oh, yeah?

165
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:19,079
Let's see
how creative you are.

166
00:08:19,116 --> 00:08:23,218
Have you... picked out
the Major's gift yet?

167
00:08:24,562 --> 00:08:25,724
Gift?

168
00:08:25,765 --> 00:08:27,929
For this Saturday.

169
00:08:29,374 --> 00:08:32,506
You do know
what Saturday is, right?

170
00:08:34,552 --> 00:08:35,520
Saturday?

171
00:08:35,555 --> 00:08:37,583
Yes.

172
00:08:37,627 --> 00:08:39,153
It's the one-month anniversary

173
00:08:39,197 --> 00:08:41,293
of your first date
with Major Kira.

174
00:08:41,336 --> 00:08:44,868
Oh... I suppose it is.

175
00:08:44,911 --> 00:08:47,144
And you haven't
picked out a gift.

176
00:08:47,183 --> 00:08:49,279
Why should I?

177
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:52,420
The man's experienced
unrequited love

178
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:54,294
for the better part
of three years

179
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:57,330
and now that he finally has her

180
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:58,900
he wants to know why

181
00:08:58,944 --> 00:09:00,436
he should celebrate
their anniversary.

182
00:09:00,515 --> 00:09:02,850
Whatever you're trying
to sell me, it won't work.

183
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:04,186
Do you think I'm going
to get involved?

184
00:09:04,224 --> 00:09:05,386
No, thank you.

185
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,953
The last thing
I want to deal with

186
00:09:06,998 --> 00:09:10,530
is a panicked lover looking
for a gift at the last minute.

187
00:09:10,573 --> 00:09:15,073
There's a whole Promenade
of shopkeepers out there

188
00:09:15,117 --> 00:09:16,848
if you want to buy a gift.

189
00:09:16,888 --> 00:09:21,628
Hmm. A one-month
anniversary gift.

190
00:09:22,835 --> 00:09:25,033
Did you ever hear of
anything so ridiculous?

191
00:09:54,711 --> 00:09:56,180
Okay.

192
00:09:56,216 --> 00:09:57,515
- So now you...
- Shh!

193
00:09:57,585 --> 00:09:59,818
Now you have him
looking for a gift.

194
00:09:59,858 --> 00:10:01,259
What are you up to?

195
00:10:01,294 --> 00:10:02,854
I tell you, you write it down...

196
00:10:02,898 --> 00:10:05,233
the next thing I know,
I'm in a holding cell.

197
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,707
I won't write a word, I promise.

198
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,508
This is just character research.

199
00:10:09,547 --> 00:10:10,537
Right.

200
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:11,551
Quark, listen.

201
00:10:11,585 --> 00:10:13,419
I'm working on a crime novel

202
00:10:13,457 --> 00:10:14,892
but I've hit a wall
in my writing.

203
00:10:14,927 --> 00:10:17,559
It's... it's not
truthful anymore...

204
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,900
phony, artificial.

205
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:21,568
I'm having trouble creating

206
00:10:21,609 --> 00:10:23,546
real flesh-and-blood
characters

207
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,709
especially nefarious ones.

208
00:10:26,288 --> 00:10:27,689
If you could just let me

209
00:10:27,724 --> 00:10:30,288
watch and listen
as you pull off...

210
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,301
whatever it is you're
going to pull off...

211
00:10:32,335 --> 00:10:34,066
it could really help me out.

212
00:10:34,106 --> 00:10:35,940
You could give me insight.

213
00:10:35,977 --> 00:10:38,575
I could even model my
lead character after you.

214
00:10:40,421 --> 00:10:42,289
Lesson Number One.

215
00:10:42,326 --> 00:10:45,322
No one involved
in an extra-legal activity

216
00:10:45,366 --> 00:10:47,998
thinks of himself as nefarious.

217
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:50,067
Sorry.

218
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:52,378
I'm a businessman, okay?

219
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:56,651
Now... if you're interested

220
00:10:56,727 --> 00:10:58,823
in learning more
about my business...

221
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,529
I think that could be arranged.

222
00:11:02,574 --> 00:11:04,100
Great.

223
00:11:07,854 --> 00:11:12,194
But nothing you see or hear
turns up in print

224
00:11:12,231 --> 00:11:13,928
and none of it... none of it...

225
00:11:13,968 --> 00:11:16,497
gets back to your father,
understand?

226
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,341
Completely.

227
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,645
So there is a sun after all.

228
00:11:20,751 --> 00:11:23,245
Of course, now that the sun
is up, I can see

229
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,659
how truly ugly
my new little home is.

230
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,794
There's nothing out there
but dirt and some rocks

231
00:11:28,837 --> 00:11:31,070
and some more dirt
and some more rocks.

232
00:11:31,109 --> 00:11:32,077
Chief?

233
00:11:32,112 --> 00:11:33,080
Uh-huh?

234
00:11:33,114 --> 00:11:34,948
Can I ask you
a personal question?

235
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,252
Sure.

236
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:41,563
Are you uncomfortable
having me aboard the <i>Defiant?</i>

237
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:42,569
No.

238
00:11:42,603 --> 00:11:43,902
Why should I be?

239
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,911
Well, I'm a civilian.

240
00:11:45,945 --> 00:11:48,645
Isn't it awkward having me
aboard a warship?

241
00:11:48,685 --> 00:11:50,713
Oh, we've had civilians
aboard before.

242
00:11:50,757 --> 00:11:51,987
Doesn't bother me.

243
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:53,722
I was afraid you were
going to say that.

244
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,198
- I can hear you!
- I'm sorry?

245
00:11:55,234 --> 00:11:56,202
- Hello?
- Don't worry about...

246
00:11:56,236 --> 00:11:57,295
Hold on a minute.

247
00:11:57,339 --> 00:11:59,868
...receiving your transmission.
Can you hear me?

248
00:11:59,911 --> 00:12:00,901
Hello?!

249
00:12:00,947 --> 00:12:02,576
Hello?

250
00:12:02,618 --> 00:12:04,087
I could hear you two talking.

251
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:05,283
Can you hear me?

252
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,124
Yes! Yes, we can hear you.

253
00:12:07,163 --> 00:12:08,530
Thank God.

254
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:10,662
Whoever you are, I love you.

255
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:18,354
My name's Lisa Cusak.

256
00:12:18,393 --> 00:12:19,692
Until a couple of days ago,

257
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,826
I was the commanding officer
of the <i>Olympia.</i>

258
00:12:21,868 --> 00:12:23,098
The <i>Olympia?</i>

259
00:12:23,138 --> 00:12:25,234
We left the Federation
over eight years ago

260
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,747
for a long-range exploration
of the Beta Quadrant.

261
00:12:27,782 --> 00:12:29,776
What happened
to your ship, Captain?

262
00:12:29,821 --> 00:12:32,919
We were finally heading home,
if you can believe that

263
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:34,956
but then we picked up
some strange energy readings

264
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,128
in a nearby star system

265
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:38,937
and I decided to stop
and investigate.

266
00:12:38,976 --> 00:12:41,915
We found an energy barrier
around the fourth planet

267
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,784
that was unlike anything
we'd ever seen

268
00:12:43,821 --> 00:12:45,815
and when we probed it
with our scanners

269
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,386
it triggered a quantum reaction.

270
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,867
There was an enormous surge
of metreon radiation

271
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:50,961
that disabled our engines.

272
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:52,304
The next thing I knew

273
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:54,539
we were spiraling in
toward the surface.

274
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,311
I gave the order to abandon ship

275
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:57,479
and the last thing I remember

276
00:12:57,521 --> 00:13:00,085
is a console exploding
in my face.

277
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:02,759
I woke up in an escape pod
on the surface

278
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,794
and I've spent
the last day and a half

279
00:13:04,838 --> 00:13:07,071
sitting in this cave trying
to raise someone on subspace.

280
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,810
Captain, Dr. Bashir,
Chief Medical Officer.

281
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,550
Your message said that you were
on an L-Class planet.

282
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,558
Are you sure?

283
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:14,686
Positive

284
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:16,220
and to answer your next question

285
00:13:16,265 --> 00:13:19,033
yes, I've been giving myself
15cc's of tri-ox

286
00:13:19,072 --> 00:13:22,843
every four hours to compensate
for the excess carbon dioxide

287
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:23,940
in the atmosphere

288
00:13:23,984 --> 00:13:26,080
just like it says
in my medical tricorder.

289
00:13:26,122 --> 00:13:28,116
How much tri-ox
do you have left?

290
00:13:28,161 --> 00:13:30,530
150 milliliters.

291
00:13:30,566 --> 00:13:34,668
Will you reduce the dosage,
Captain

292
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,772
to 8cc's every six hours?

293
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,150
We need to stretch out
your supply as long as possible.

294
00:13:39,187 --> 00:13:41,351
What happens when she runs out
of the drug?

295
00:13:41,425 --> 00:13:44,523
That's a good question, Doctor.
What happens then?

296
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:48,030
You will begin to experience
the effects of hypoxia

297
00:13:48,075 --> 00:13:50,604
but before that happens,
the tri-ox compound

298
00:13:50,648 --> 00:13:53,553
will have strengthened
your cardiopulmonary system

299
00:13:53,588 --> 00:13:55,559
allowing you
to better withstand the effects.

300
00:13:55,593 --> 00:13:57,530
"Better withstand the effects."

301
00:13:57,565 --> 00:14:00,265
In other words,
I'm going to be gasping for air

302
00:14:00,305 --> 00:14:03,369
and turning different shades of
blue by the time you get here.

303
00:14:04,582 --> 00:14:06,313
Yes, I'm afraid so.

304
00:14:06,352 --> 00:14:07,878
Thanks for brightening my day.

305
00:14:07,922 --> 00:14:09,893
Is there anything we can do?

306
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:11,989
There is, actually.
I can't sleep.

307
00:14:12,032 --> 00:14:14,367
I-I think the injections
are keeping me awake

308
00:14:14,404 --> 00:14:16,671
and I haven't had anyone
to talk to for two days.

309
00:14:16,711 --> 00:14:19,240
We'll be able to help you
with that, Captain.

310
00:14:19,283 --> 00:14:20,718
I'll have one of my officers

311
00:14:20,753 --> 00:14:23,817
stay on the com line
with you at all times.

312
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:26,059
And order them to enjoy it, too.

313
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,569
Done.

314
00:14:27,603 --> 00:14:29,733
So, who's first?

315
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,377
I think I'd better start.

316
00:14:32,415 --> 00:14:34,078
Sounds good to me.

317
00:14:35,756 --> 00:14:40,358
A lot has happened...
since you left, Captain.

318
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:45,609
The Second Fleet hit
the Dominion forces

319
00:14:45,646 --> 00:14:48,175
occupying Betazed three
times in the last month

320
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:50,349
but they keep sending
in reinforcements

321
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:53,023
and fortifying their positions,
so we find it...

322
00:14:53,065 --> 00:14:54,295
Okay, okay...

323
00:14:55,336 --> 00:14:57,466
That's it, please.
No more war news.

324
00:14:57,575 --> 00:14:58,942
You're depressing me.

325
00:14:58,978 --> 00:15:00,447
Oh, sorry.

326
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:03,319
No. I'm sorry.

327
00:15:03,355 --> 00:15:06,852
I'm sorry for you and me
and everyone in the Federation.

328
00:15:06,897 --> 00:15:09,597
I can't believe we're at war.

329
00:15:09,637 --> 00:15:11,437
Let's change the subject.

330
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:13,343
How about some good news?

331
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,438
Tell me there's still something

332
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:16,246
to look forward to
when I get home.

333
00:15:16,286 --> 00:15:18,189
Tell me people
still fall in love

334
00:15:18,225 --> 00:15:20,458
and get married
and raise families.

335
00:15:20,497 --> 00:15:22,400
They do.

336
00:15:22,435 --> 00:15:25,841
Good, and what about you?
Are you married?

337
00:15:25,876 --> 00:15:27,277
No.

338
00:15:27,312 --> 00:15:28,975
Seeing anyone?

339
00:15:29,017 --> 00:15:30,486
I mean, I hate to pry
but I'd like to think

340
00:15:30,521 --> 00:15:31,751
that there's still
something positive

341
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,659
in the life of
a starship captain these days.

342
00:15:34,831 --> 00:15:37,132
I am seeing someone.

343
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,833
Oh, now we're talking.

344
00:15:38,874 --> 00:15:41,038
Tell me about her.
What's her name?

345
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:42,879
Kasidy Yates.

346
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:46,380
Kasidy? Is she the same Kasidy
I spoke to earlier?

347
00:15:46,425 --> 00:15:47,519
That's her.

348
00:15:47,562 --> 00:15:48,530
She one of your officers?

349
00:15:48,597 --> 00:15:50,932
No. Civilian.

350
00:15:50,969 --> 00:15:53,065
Freighter Captain.

351
00:15:53,107 --> 00:15:56,513
Uh-oh. Sounds like
you're having problems.

352
00:15:56,549 --> 00:15:58,280
Why would you say
something like that?

353
00:15:58,321 --> 00:16:01,659
There's no joy
in that voice of yours, Ben.

354
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:04,429
In fact, the tension level
went up when you said her name.

355
00:16:04,468 --> 00:16:05,493
You sounded more relaxed

356
00:16:05,538 --> 00:16:07,167
when you were telling me
about the war.

357
00:16:10,783 --> 00:16:13,152
Ben, are you still there?

358
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,457
Yes.

359
00:16:15,495 --> 00:16:17,625
Yes, I'm still here.

360
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:19,865
You just...

361
00:16:19,906 --> 00:16:22,070
caught me off-guard...

362
00:16:23,614 --> 00:16:25,311
a little.

363
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:27,414
I can tell.

364
00:16:27,457 --> 00:16:29,325
You know, back when I
was a junior officer

365
00:16:29,361 --> 00:16:31,525
I dated a civilian
for six years.

366
00:16:31,566 --> 00:16:33,799
Want to hear about it?

367
00:16:33,838 --> 00:16:35,068
Sure you do.

368
00:16:35,108 --> 00:16:39,448
Why? Because it's a funny story
and one of us needs to cheer up.

369
00:16:39,485 --> 00:16:41,422
So we met on Andor.

370
00:16:41,457 --> 00:16:44,191
I was assigned to the Federation
Embassy as an attaché

371
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,067
and he was working in the
Andorian Agricultural Ministry.

372
00:16:47,104 --> 00:16:49,405
Now, at first, I didn't want
anything to do with him.

373
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:50,912
He kept pointing
his antennae at me

374
00:16:50,946 --> 00:16:52,506
whenever I walked
through his office

375
00:16:52,551 --> 00:16:54,606
and I found that sort of rude.

376
00:16:55,941 --> 00:16:57,706
Excuse me...
coming through.

377
00:16:57,746 --> 00:16:59,443
Excuse me, excuse me...

378
00:16:59,483 --> 00:17:00,782
Odo.

379
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,918
Well... this is it.

380
00:17:03,961 --> 00:17:05,692
Can I see it?

381
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:11,142
Oh...

382
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:13,708
very nice.

383
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:15,779
The Major's going to love it.

384
00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:20,995
How are you going
to give it to her?

385
00:17:21,035 --> 00:17:24,008
What sort of evening
do you have planned?

386
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,207
I don't have anything planned.

387
00:17:26,248 --> 00:17:29,689
Oh... fortunately for you,
there's still time.

388
00:17:36,037 --> 00:17:37,336
Pick one.

389
00:17:37,374 --> 00:17:39,242
A holosuite program?

390
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:40,942
It's your anniversary.

391
00:17:40,983 --> 00:17:43,011
You have to do
something special.

392
00:17:43,054 --> 00:17:44,614
I bought her a gift.

393
00:17:46,763 --> 00:17:48,528
Have it your way.

394
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,368
But if it were me

395
00:17:50,405 --> 00:17:53,971
and I had found true love
after a lifetime of searching...

396
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:58,451
every month would be
worth celebrating.

397
00:17:59,494 --> 00:18:01,328
All right.

398
00:18:01,365 --> 00:18:03,461
Let me look at those programs.

399
00:18:03,504 --> 00:18:04,939
Come on.

400
00:18:18,205 --> 00:18:19,731
Looks like the Constable's

401
00:18:19,776 --> 00:18:21,906
going to be busy
Saturday night.

402
00:18:21,948 --> 00:18:23,383
I guess that means

403
00:18:23,418 --> 00:18:25,412
he won't be following
me around the station

404
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,893
or watching the airlocks
for wanted criminals

405
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:31,928
or monitoring the cargo bays
for illegal transactions.

406
00:18:31,972 --> 00:18:33,909
Well, he has deputies.

407
00:18:33,943 --> 00:18:35,606
Deputies, I can handle.

408
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,311
With Odo out of the way

409
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:41,156
my biggest problem
will be deciding...

410
00:18:41,193 --> 00:18:44,030
what to do with all the
money I'm going to make!

411
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:46,300
...both my sisters are teachers.

412
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,969
I don't know how they can do it.

413
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:50,345
Personally,
I can't stand children.

414
00:18:50,382 --> 00:18:51,476
Uh-huh.

415
00:18:51,585 --> 00:18:54,251
I know... -
I know everybody loves children.

416
00:18:54,292 --> 00:18:55,886
Not me.

417
00:18:55,929 --> 00:18:57,262
Yeah.

418
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:59,429
What about you?
You like children?

419
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,872
Oh, yeah.

420
00:19:00,908 --> 00:19:03,574
Really?

421
00:19:03,614 --> 00:19:04,810
Yeah.

422
00:19:04,851 --> 00:19:06,445
You know, Doctor,
I'm starting to think

423
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:08,458
that maybe, just maybe

424
00:19:08,493 --> 00:19:10,156
you're not really
paying attention to...

425
00:19:11,165 --> 00:19:12,464
Wait a minute.

426
00:19:12,502 --> 00:19:14,131
What's that?

427
00:19:14,173 --> 00:19:16,508
There's something moving
out there.

428
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:19,211
It's getting closer.

429
00:19:19,252 --> 00:19:20,277
What?

430
00:19:20,321 --> 00:19:21,984
Stay back.

431
00:19:22,026 --> 00:19:24,293
No. Don't hurt me.

432
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:25,994
Captain, what's going on?

433
00:19:26,035 --> 00:19:27,732
Please, stay back.

434
00:19:27,773 --> 00:19:29,971
No, don't...

435
00:19:30,011 --> 00:19:31,036
No!

436
00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:40,194
Captain Cusak, can you hear me?

437
00:19:40,235 --> 00:19:41,294
Hello?

438
00:19:44,712 --> 00:19:46,204
Hello?

439
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:47,548
God...

440
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,215
She's gone.

441
00:19:49,257 --> 00:19:50,988
Who is this?

442
00:19:51,028 --> 00:19:52,258
What have you done?

443
00:19:52,298 --> 00:19:54,394
I have eaten her.

444
00:19:54,436 --> 00:19:55,404
What?

445
00:19:55,438 --> 00:19:57,101
I've eaten her!

446
00:19:57,143 --> 00:19:59,011
What difference
does it make to you?

447
00:19:59,047 --> 00:20:01,041
You weren't
even listening to her.

448
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:06,761
You have my sincere apologies.

449
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,736
I was carried away with my work.

450
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,898
I'm a patient, aren't I?

451
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,070
Doesn't that make me
part of your work?

452
00:20:12,112 --> 00:20:14,049
You're right...
you're absolutely right.

453
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,677
I don't know
what I was thinking.

454
00:20:17,056 --> 00:20:19,893
You now have
my complete attention.

455
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,367
Well, I've got news for you,
Doc.

456
00:20:23,405 --> 00:20:24,931
I'm all talked out.

457
00:20:24,976 --> 00:20:27,311
It's time for you
to cheer up one of your patients

458
00:20:27,348 --> 00:20:29,148
and take her mind
off her impending doom.

459
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,154
You're not doomed.

460
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:32,126
I feel better already.

461
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,652
See how easy that was?

462
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,324
Now keep going.

463
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,896
Oh, what should I talk about?

464
00:20:37,941 --> 00:20:40,071
How did they let you
out of medical school

465
00:20:40,112 --> 00:20:42,140
with this kind
of bedside manner?

466
00:20:42,184 --> 00:20:44,178
Are you sure you're a doctor?

467
00:20:44,222 --> 00:20:46,625
Yes, I graduated
second in my class, in fact.

468
00:20:46,661 --> 00:20:49,725
Oh. And we're especially
proud of that, aren't we?

469
00:20:52,175 --> 00:20:54,704
I get the feeling that it's
going to take me some hours

470
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,978
to crawl out of
this rather sizable hole

471
00:20:57,019 --> 00:20:58,318
I've dug for myself.

472
00:20:58,356 --> 00:20:59,324
Not at all.

473
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,694
It'll take you days.

474
00:21:05,172 --> 00:21:08,339
You have my personal assurance
they're high-quality crystals

475
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,544
and you won't get them
at this price

476
00:21:10,585 --> 00:21:11,918
anywhere else in the Quadrant.

477
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,237
Five days, Cargo Bay 3.
See you then.

478
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:24,346
I'll take this one.

479
00:21:24,385 --> 00:21:26,481
Ah...

480
00:21:26,524 --> 00:21:28,518
"Paris, 1928."

481
00:21:28,561 --> 00:21:30,464
Nice choice.

482
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:32,834
Say what you will
about humans today.

483
00:21:32,871 --> 00:21:34,431
Their past was certainly...

484
00:21:34,476 --> 00:21:35,740
romantic.

485
00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:36,747
Well, book us four hours

486
00:21:36,781 --> 00:21:38,410
starting at 2100
on Sunday night.

487
00:21:38,452 --> 00:21:39,785
You mean Saturday.

488
00:21:40,825 --> 00:21:42,260
I mean Sunday.

489
00:21:43,397 --> 00:21:45,527
But Saturday's the anniversary
of your first date.

490
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:48,063
Yes, but our first
date ended badly.

491
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:49,510
It's not something
I want to commemorate

492
00:21:49,545 --> 00:21:50,912
so I've decided to celebrate

493
00:21:50,949 --> 00:21:53,045
the anniversary
of our first kiss.

494
00:21:53,087 --> 00:21:54,990
Your first kiss?

495
00:21:55,024 --> 00:21:55,992
Romantic, isn't it?

496
00:21:57,063 --> 00:21:58,053
Aw...

497
00:22:07,087 --> 00:22:08,454
Come on.

498
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,822
Come on.

499
00:22:11,865 --> 00:22:12,764
What's going on?

500
00:22:12,867 --> 00:22:13,766
My partner...

501
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,966
I can't get him on the channel.

502
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:20,079
He's changed
his com system protocols.

503
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,919
Already?
You just talked to him.

504
00:22:21,956 --> 00:22:23,790
He's a wanted man, Jake.

505
00:22:23,861 --> 00:22:24,989
He has to be very careful

506
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,499
about how often
he uses subspace.

507
00:22:26,534 --> 00:22:27,901
The authorities might try

508
00:22:27,937 --> 00:22:29,270
and trace his signal.

509
00:22:31,011 --> 00:22:33,813
I have no way of contacting him

510
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:36,915
until he gets here
Saturday night.

511
00:22:36,959 --> 00:22:39,557
Well, can't you just explain
to him that he'll have to wait

512
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:40,567
another day?

513
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:41,831
Haven't you been
paying attention?

514
00:22:41,871 --> 00:22:43,363
If he even sets foot
on the station

515
00:22:43,407 --> 00:22:45,708
while Odo's on duty,
we'll both be in a holding cell

516
00:22:45,746 --> 00:22:48,548
faster than you can say
"criminal conspiracy."

517
00:22:52,195 --> 00:22:54,462
Well, what are you going to do?

518
00:22:54,501 --> 00:22:56,802
Th-think.

519
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,107
My best option is, uh...

520
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:01,173
um...

521
00:23:01,217 --> 00:23:02,846
panic.

522
00:23:08,713 --> 00:23:11,242
When the fighting first
broke out, I thought to myself

523
00:23:11,286 --> 00:23:13,884
"All right, O'Brien,
you've done this before.

524
00:23:15,863 --> 00:23:18,130
"Keep your head down...

525
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:22,009
"focus on the job
and you'll get through this...

526
00:23:22,045 --> 00:23:23,776
just like you did
in the last war."

527
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,923
But this war is different.

528
00:23:26,957 --> 00:23:29,224
Maybe I'm different.

529
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:33,038
I have this...

530
00:23:33,072 --> 00:23:35,601
this growing sense of isolation.

531
00:23:35,645 --> 00:23:36,704
I see people.

532
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:40,120
I... talk to them,
I laugh with them, and...

533
00:23:40,155 --> 00:23:43,561
But some part of me
is always saying...

534
00:23:46,437 --> 00:23:48,966
"They may not be here tomorrow.

535
00:23:50,314 --> 00:23:52,615
Don't get too close."

536
00:23:54,156 --> 00:23:55,990
I'm sorry. I...

537
00:23:56,027 --> 00:23:57,257
I'm sorry.

538
00:23:57,296 --> 00:23:59,324
I shouldn't be laying all this
on your shoulders, Captain.

539
00:23:59,368 --> 00:24:02,364
No, no, it's all right, Miles.
I don't mind.

540
00:24:02,476 --> 00:24:04,970
Sounds like you really need
to talk with someone about this.

541
00:24:05,015 --> 00:24:07,077
I'm sure it's the last thing
you need to hear.

542
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,557
I should be cheering you up.

543
00:24:09,593 --> 00:24:11,119
Forget about me.

544
00:24:11,163 --> 00:24:13,100
You're the one
who needs cheering up.

545
00:24:14,404 --> 00:24:16,398
Now, there's
a sad state of affairs.

546
00:24:16,509 --> 00:24:19,277
Look, you've seen a lot
of combat in the last year.

547
00:24:19,316 --> 00:24:21,446
That's a heavy burden
to carry around.

548
00:24:22,457 --> 00:24:25,191
Are you sure you're a Captain,
not a Counselor?

549
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,631
Oh, I'm sure.

550
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:29,537
I'll let you in
on a little secret, Miles.

551
00:24:29,574 --> 00:24:32,045
I dislike the whole concept
of a ship's counselor.

552
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,447
Me, too.

553
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,680
I mean, I-I like some of them
personally, but...

554
00:24:35,722 --> 00:24:38,091
But sometimes
they just get in the way.

555
00:24:38,127 --> 00:24:40,462
That's exactly how I feel

556
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,698
but saying it out loud
is almost heresy.

557
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:46,143
And there's this assumption
nowadays that...

558
00:24:46,181 --> 00:24:48,015
only someone with a diploma

559
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:51,492
can listen to your problems
or give you advice.

560
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,656
Sometimes, all you need
are good friends.

561
00:24:53,698 --> 00:24:55,065
Exactly.

562
00:24:55,101 --> 00:24:56,502
So where are they?

563
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:57,871
What? Excuse me?

564
00:24:57,908 --> 00:24:59,275
Where are your friends, Miles?

565
00:24:59,312 --> 00:25:01,579
Why aren't they helping you
through this?

566
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,924
Well, we, uh...

567
00:25:05,961 --> 00:25:08,330
I haven't spoken to them
about any of this.

568
00:25:08,367 --> 00:25:11,465
You know, it's not the kind
of thing you talk about.

569
00:25:11,574 --> 00:25:15,447
Hmm. Well, if you can't talk
to your friends

570
00:25:15,484 --> 00:25:19,050
and you can't talk to your wife,
you know who that leaves.

571
00:25:20,195 --> 00:25:22,291
- A ship's counselor.
- A ship's counselor.

572
00:25:23,737 --> 00:25:26,710
Excuse me, but it's 1800 hours.

573
00:25:26,744 --> 00:25:28,111
Already?

574
00:25:28,147 --> 00:25:29,137
Afraid so.

575
00:25:29,183 --> 00:25:30,482
But we're still talking.

576
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,152
Boys, boys, don't fight over me.

577
00:25:33,192 --> 00:25:35,356
Miles, I'll talk to you
in the morning.

578
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:37,096
And think about what I said.

579
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:39,334
All right.

580
00:25:39,374 --> 00:25:41,037
And I will.

581
00:25:41,078 --> 00:25:43,379
Good night, Captain.

582
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:45,286
Good night.

583
00:25:46,358 --> 00:25:48,556
Well, Julian, don't let me
keep you from your work.

584
00:25:48,597 --> 00:25:50,089
I know how busy you are.

585
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:51,898
No work tonight.

586
00:25:51,938 --> 00:25:55,208
Oh! So you've decided
to spend your valuable time

587
00:25:55,245 --> 00:25:57,079
conversing
with your patient again.

588
00:25:57,117 --> 00:25:58,552
That's three days in a row.

589
00:25:58,587 --> 00:26:00,785
You must be swamped
with paperwork by now.

590
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:03,697
I feel awful, keeping you
from your duties like this.

591
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:06,136
I managed to catch up with
all my paperwork this afternoon

592
00:26:06,172 --> 00:26:07,197
thank you very much.

593
00:26:07,241 --> 00:26:08,767
Let me guess.

594
00:26:08,811 --> 00:26:12,012
Thanks to your amazing
genetically engineered brain

595
00:26:12,053 --> 00:26:13,750
you not only did your work

596
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:16,558
you did the work of ten
other doctors at the same time.

597
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,099
Well?

598
00:26:18,134 --> 00:26:19,660
But you've answered
the next question

599
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:22,073
I was going to ask you,
which is "how are you feeling?"

600
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:25,174
I can hear that you're
in your usual acerbic good mood.

601
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:28,487
Wrong again,
my superhuman friend.

602
00:26:28,526 --> 00:26:31,431
As a matter of fact,
I'm not feeling well at all.

603
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:32,992
Tell me.

604
00:26:33,036 --> 00:26:35,600
The last injection
didn't do the trick.

605
00:26:35,643 --> 00:26:38,012
I feel this heavy weight
on my chest.

606
00:26:38,048 --> 00:26:40,178
It's getting harder to breathe

607
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,661
and every time I move my head,
the cave starts spinning.

608
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:46,657
Come in.

609
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:50,203
What is it?

610
00:26:50,244 --> 00:26:51,736
Captain Cusak's
run out of tri-ox.

611
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:54,184
She's beginning to feel
the effects of CO2 poisoning.

612
00:26:54,221 --> 00:26:55,417
Already?

613
00:26:55,456 --> 00:26:58,452
I thought she had at least a
day's worth of injections left.

614
00:26:58,498 --> 00:27:00,366
So did I,
but apparently the last vial

615
00:27:00,401 --> 00:27:02,565
was tainted somehow,
probably in the crash.

616
00:27:02,607 --> 00:27:04,167
How long does she have?

617
00:27:04,211 --> 00:27:06,580
No more than two days.

618
00:27:07,787 --> 00:27:09,416
That's not good.

619
00:27:09,457 --> 00:27:11,222
We're still three days away.

620
00:27:19,882 --> 00:27:21,181
We need more speed.

621
00:27:21,218 --> 00:27:22,653
Speed's not the problem.

622
00:27:22,689 --> 00:27:25,423
I could increase
the warp plasma 97 gigahertz.

623
00:27:25,461 --> 00:27:28,093
That would increase our velocity
to warp 9.5

624
00:27:28,135 --> 00:27:29,661
and save us almost a full day.

625
00:27:29,738 --> 00:27:31,538
The problem on the <i>Defiant</i> is

626
00:27:31,577 --> 00:27:33,308
how to maintain
structural integrity

627
00:27:33,347 --> 00:27:34,680
when we go above warp 9.

628
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,584
Exactly.
At those kind of speeds

629
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:39,356
the ship literally starts
tearing herself apart.

630
00:27:39,395 --> 00:27:42,300
Is there any way to strengthen
the structural integrity field?

631
00:27:42,336 --> 00:27:44,934
Not without bleeding power
from some other source.

632
00:27:44,976 --> 00:27:46,104
Such as?

633
00:27:46,144 --> 00:27:47,112
The phaser reserves.

634
00:27:47,147 --> 00:27:48,309
That would be unwise.

635
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,614
If we empty the defense reserves

636
00:27:49,653 --> 00:27:51,681
we could find ourselves
at an extreme disadvantage

637
00:27:51,725 --> 00:27:53,559
should we encounter
a Dominion ship.

638
00:27:53,596 --> 00:27:55,533
We're a long way from
the front lines out here, Worf.

639
00:27:55,568 --> 00:27:58,234
The chances of meeting
a Dominion ship are negligible.

640
00:27:58,274 --> 00:27:59,937
We should not take that risk.

641
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:02,746
She'll die if we do not get
to her faster.

642
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:07,830
Use the phaser reserve, Chief.

643
00:28:07,864 --> 00:28:09,835
Give us all the speed you can.

644
00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:11,566
Aye, sir.
Thank you, sir.

645
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:20,717
How's it going?

646
00:28:20,828 --> 00:28:22,354
We're increasing speed.

647
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:24,962
The Captain's condition
is worsening.

648
00:28:25,005 --> 00:28:26,304
I see.

649
00:28:26,342 --> 00:28:27,971
Is there anything I can do?

650
00:28:28,012 --> 00:28:29,504
I don't think so.

651
00:28:30,852 --> 00:28:33,654
Well, I guess
I'll see you later.

652
00:28:33,692 --> 00:28:36,358
- Right.
- Right.

653
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,647
Are you sure
you want to hear about this?

654
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:46,174
Trust me, Ben.

655
00:28:46,219 --> 00:28:48,622
I'd much rather be worrying
about your love life

656
00:28:48,658 --> 00:28:50,629
than about my own problems
right now.

657
00:28:53,971 --> 00:28:58,277
Well, when Kasidy came
to the Bridge last night

658
00:28:58,314 --> 00:29:00,785
all I wanted her to do
was leave

659
00:29:00,821 --> 00:29:03,658
and I couldn't tell you why.

660
00:29:03,694 --> 00:29:07,396
She doesn't belong there, Ben.
That's why.

661
00:29:07,436 --> 00:29:11,343
She doesn't belong in that part
of your life, and you know it.

662
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,821
Off duty, I'm sure Kasidy
is exactly what you need

663
00:29:14,854 --> 00:29:18,454
but on the <i>Defiant,</i>
she's a random element...

664
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:22,538
a piece that doesn't fit
anywhere in the puzzle.

665
00:29:26,482 --> 00:29:30,253
She was the Convoy Liaison
Officer on our last mission

666
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:32,091
and a damned good one, too.

667
00:29:32,163 --> 00:29:34,532
This isn't about her.

668
00:29:34,568 --> 00:29:36,037
This is about you.

669
00:29:36,072 --> 00:29:38,100
You're having trouble
doing your job

670
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:40,911
when she's on the <i>Defiant,</i>
and that's a problem.

671
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,479
It's also affecting
your relationship

672
00:29:43,522 --> 00:29:45,959
and that's another problem.

673
00:29:45,996 --> 00:29:47,659
Don't take it so hard.

674
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:51,231
So you can't mix your personal
life and your professional life.

675
00:29:51,275 --> 00:29:53,246
Most people can't.

676
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,342
I certainly can't.

677
00:29:55,385 --> 00:29:58,449
I once served on the same
starbase as my sister.

678
00:29:58,492 --> 00:30:00,292
Oh, what a nightmare that was.

679
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:04,167
I look forward
to meeting you, Lisa.

680
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:06,369
I'm sure I'm not the only one

681
00:30:06,411 --> 00:30:08,541
around here
who feels the same way.

682
00:30:08,582 --> 00:30:10,108
If you ask me...

683
00:30:11,524 --> 00:30:15,158
...everyone on that ship
could use some R&R.

684
00:30:22,783 --> 00:30:24,686
Beautiful, aren't they?

685
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:26,487
Gorgeous.

686
00:30:27,762 --> 00:30:30,063
Do you know how much
I was going to get for these?

687
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,636
Almost 200 bars.

688
00:30:33,677 --> 00:30:35,112
That's a lot.

689
00:30:35,147 --> 00:30:37,118
No kidding.
That's a lot.

690
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:41,218
Now... they're just
a crate full of junk.

691
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,367
You know, there's still a chance

692
00:30:44,403 --> 00:30:46,271
that Odo won't find out
about any of this.

693
00:30:46,306 --> 00:30:49,370
No, he'll find out.

694
00:30:50,985 --> 00:30:54,391
Odo would love nothing better
than to see me in jail.

695
00:30:56,164 --> 00:30:58,260
And after all I did for him.

696
00:30:58,302 --> 00:30:59,794
Like what?

697
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:04,940
Like helping him find true love.

698
00:31:04,984 --> 00:31:06,749
That's right.

699
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:08,019
If it wasn't for me

700
00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:10,428
he and Major Kira would
never have gotten together

701
00:31:10,465 --> 00:31:11,455
in the first place.

702
00:31:12,803 --> 00:31:14,671
I was there for him

703
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:18,205
during all the heartache
and the lonely nights.

704
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,187
He was wallowing in misery

705
00:31:20,222 --> 00:31:22,591
because she was
still seeing Shakaar.

706
00:31:22,627 --> 00:31:24,655
I told him to make his move.

707
00:31:26,604 --> 00:31:28,802
I told him not to give up.

708
00:31:30,981 --> 00:31:32,644
I was there for him.

709
00:31:35,358 --> 00:31:37,261
And what did I get out of it?

710
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:38,629
Nothing.

711
00:31:38,665 --> 00:31:40,659
He still spies on me.

712
00:31:40,703 --> 00:31:42,070
He still bothers me

713
00:31:42,107 --> 00:31:44,271
about minor infractions
of the law.

714
00:31:45,549 --> 00:31:48,647
And he still can't wait
for the opportunity

715
00:31:48,689 --> 00:31:50,557
to send me to prison.

716
00:31:54,904 --> 00:31:58,846
I should have remembered
the 285th Rule of Acquisition.

717
00:32:01,788 --> 00:32:05,992
"No good deed
ever goes unpunished."

718
00:32:50,236 --> 00:32:51,671
To failure.

719
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:53,109
I'm not drinking to that.

720
00:32:53,144 --> 00:32:56,311
Jake, in ten minutes

721
00:32:56,351 --> 00:32:59,347
my business partner's ship
will dock.

722
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:02,559
In 15 minutes,
Odo will arrest him.

723
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,573
In 20 minutes,
my name will come up.

724
00:33:05,607 --> 00:33:11,019
And in 25 minutes, Odo will walk
in here with a warrant.

725
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,760
I think you should humor me
on this one.

726
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,324
Quark...

727
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:34,742
I'd like
that holosuite now after all.

728
00:33:34,777 --> 00:33:36,007
You would.

729
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:37,141
That's right.

730
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:39,917
Turns out
Nerys agrees with you.

731
00:33:39,956 --> 00:33:42,485
She wants to celebrate
the anniversary

732
00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:44,693
of our first date,
not our first kiss.

733
00:33:44,734 --> 00:33:45,998
So here we are.

734
00:33:47,373 --> 00:33:50,073
Is the holosuite
still available?

735
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:53,451
It's, um... it's all yours.

736
00:33:54,557 --> 00:33:56,755
The program?

737
00:34:08,023 --> 00:34:09,253
Odo?

738
00:34:10,696 --> 00:34:11,790
Have a good time.

739
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:13,029
Thank you, Quark.

740
00:34:13,068 --> 00:34:14,230
I'm sure we will.

741
00:34:17,546 --> 00:34:19,015
I don't believe it.

742
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,850
Neither do I.

743
00:34:20,887 --> 00:34:24,191
I'm going to win this one, Jake.

744
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,359
You know what the best part is?

745
00:34:26,401 --> 00:34:28,531
I beat Odo.

746
00:34:28,572 --> 00:34:31,636
I finally beat him.

747
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,674
Jake, I did it.

748
00:34:33,718 --> 00:34:35,119
I've beat him.

749
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,558
Well, he looks happy.

750
00:34:40,601 --> 00:34:41,569
He should be.

751
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,903
He's about to make
his biggest profit of the year.

752
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:48,753
I don't know, Odo.

753
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:50,188
You sure you want
to let him get away

754
00:34:50,224 --> 00:34:51,989
with smuggling Denevan crystals?

755
00:34:52,029 --> 00:34:53,726
I owe him one.

756
00:34:53,766 --> 00:34:56,033
So he'll get this one...

757
00:34:56,071 --> 00:34:59,238
but just this one.

758
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:04,917
Why is it every time
I think I have you figured out

759
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,193
you do something
to surprise me?

760
00:35:07,232 --> 00:35:08,963
Like tonight.

761
00:35:09,002 --> 00:35:10,437
Where did you get the idea

762
00:35:10,473 --> 00:35:13,105
to celebrate our one-month
anniversary in Paris?

763
00:35:13,146 --> 00:35:16,587
Well, some mysteries

764
00:35:16,621 --> 00:35:19,185
are better left unsolved.

765
00:35:34,463 --> 00:35:35,762
I want a complete scan
of that barrier

766
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:37,895
but use passive sensors
only, gentlemen.

767
00:35:37,938 --> 00:35:40,911
An active scan is what triggered
the destruction of the <i>Olympia.</i>

768
00:35:40,945 --> 00:35:41,913
Aye, sir.

769
00:35:41,948 --> 00:35:43,440
It appears to be
an exogenic field

770
00:35:43,485 --> 00:35:46,083
generated by the unstable
elements in the planet's core.

771
00:35:47,227 --> 00:35:49,061
Captain Cusak
just lost consciousness.

772
00:35:49,098 --> 00:35:51,035
She's in the last stages
of CO2 poisoning.

773
00:35:51,069 --> 00:35:52,163
If she's got any chance at all

774
00:35:52,205 --> 00:35:54,335
we have to get her to Sick Bay
in the next 45 minutes.

775
00:35:55,346 --> 00:35:56,679
Captain, there's no way

776
00:35:56,716 --> 00:35:58,310
the <i>Defiant</i> can
penetrate the barrier.

777
00:35:58,387 --> 00:36:01,850
The energy's composed
of subspace metreon radiation.

778
00:36:01,895 --> 00:36:03,524
If we get anywhere near it

779
00:36:03,566 --> 00:36:06,266
the dilithium matrix
in the warp core will collapse

780
00:36:06,306 --> 00:36:08,003
and we'll be pulled down
onto the planet's surface

781
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:09,307
just like the <i>Olympia.</i>

782
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,091
Options?

783
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:20,436
Could we beam through it?

784
00:36:20,473 --> 00:36:22,569
No. We can't get close enough
to the barrier

785
00:36:22,611 --> 00:36:23,739
to initiate transport.

786
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,148
What about a shuttlepod?

787
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:27,314
Their impulse engines
don't use antimatter.

788
00:36:27,423 --> 00:36:29,894
It is unlikely that
a shuttle could withstand

789
00:36:29,929 --> 00:36:32,902
the gravimetric stresses
that are within the barrier.

790
00:36:32,936 --> 00:36:34,633
Unlikely but not impossible.

791
00:36:36,712 --> 00:36:39,047
I didn't come all this way
to give up.

792
00:36:39,084 --> 00:36:40,280
I'll take the risk.

793
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,553
Doctor, Mr. O'Brien,
you're with me.

794
00:36:42,592 --> 00:36:44,529
Mr. Worf, you have the Bridge.

795
00:36:44,564 --> 00:36:45,692
Aye, sir.

796
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:09,353
Sisko to <i>Defiant.</i>

797
00:37:09,424 --> 00:37:11,121
We're preparing
to enter the barrier.

798
00:37:11,161 --> 00:37:12,129
Acknowledged.

799
00:37:12,164 --> 00:37:13,132
Good luck, Captain.

800
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:14,156
Thank you, Commander.

801
00:37:18,211 --> 00:37:20,045
Shields down to 73 percent.

802
00:37:21,953 --> 00:37:23,388
Primary power grid off-line.

803
00:37:23,457 --> 00:37:24,585
Switching to backups.

804
00:37:24,627 --> 00:37:26,221
Shields at 50 percent.

805
00:37:26,264 --> 00:37:28,394
We're losing
the navigational computer.

806
00:37:28,469 --> 00:37:30,337
Secondary nav comp on line.

807
00:37:30,374 --> 00:37:31,843
We're coming out of it.

808
00:37:38,894 --> 00:37:40,193
Damage report.

809
00:37:40,231 --> 00:37:43,295
Some buckling
in the starboard hull plating

810
00:37:43,338 --> 00:37:44,967
but otherwise, we're fine.

811
00:37:45,009 --> 00:37:46,706
Scan the planet, Doctor.

812
00:37:46,746 --> 00:37:49,446
Not showing any life sign.

813
00:37:50,488 --> 00:37:52,721
Wait. I found the crash site...

814
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,059
and the cave.

815
00:37:54,097 --> 00:37:56,568
Is there somewhere
we can set down nearby?

816
00:37:56,604 --> 00:37:57,766
Yes.

817
00:37:57,806 --> 00:37:59,070
How are we for time?

818
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:00,237
It's going to be tight.

819
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:01,475
We've got to get her
in the shuttle

820
00:38:01,515 --> 00:38:03,577
and back on the ship
in 20 minutes.

821
00:38:52,738 --> 00:38:54,732
Still no life readings.

822
00:38:54,776 --> 00:38:56,713
This has to be
the only direction

823
00:38:56,748 --> 00:38:58,548
she could have been headed in.

824
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:12,914
Over here.

825
00:39:26,285 --> 00:39:28,552
It was a human female...

826
00:39:28,623 --> 00:39:33,761
51 years of age
at time of death.

827
00:39:33,803 --> 00:39:37,131
Cause of death,
carbon dioxide poisoning.

828
00:39:37,264 --> 00:39:39,201
It can't be Lisa.

829
00:39:39,235 --> 00:39:42,231
That woman's been dead
for years.

830
00:39:42,276 --> 00:39:45,739
Three years and two months,
but all the evidence fits.

831
00:39:45,784 --> 00:39:47,812
Age, rank...

832
00:39:47,855 --> 00:39:50,851
the way she died.

833
00:39:52,534 --> 00:39:54,368
If she's been dead
for three years

834
00:39:54,404 --> 00:39:56,705
how has she
been talking to us?

835
00:39:56,744 --> 00:40:00,116
It must have something to do
with the energy barrier.

836
00:40:00,152 --> 00:40:01,952
When her subspace radio signal

837
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:04,154
passed
through the metreon radiation

838
00:40:04,195 --> 00:40:06,257
in the barrier,
the signal somehow

839
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,997
time-shifted into the future.

840
00:40:08,071 --> 00:40:10,542
Then when you sent
the return signal?

841
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:11,876
It went through the barrier

842
00:40:11,913 --> 00:40:13,941
and traveled back in time
in the same way.

843
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:18,957
We've been talking to someone
from the past?

844
00:40:21,403 --> 00:40:23,032
So what do we do now?

845
00:40:24,644 --> 00:40:26,706
We should bury her.

846
00:40:29,422 --> 00:40:31,893
No, not here.

847
00:40:31,928 --> 00:40:35,425
Not alone in this cave.

848
00:40:36,439 --> 00:40:38,637
We'll take her back with us...

849
00:40:38,677 --> 00:40:40,671
give her a proper burial...

850
00:40:40,716 --> 00:40:43,153
among friends.

851
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:58,784
It's called an Irish wake.

852
00:40:58,826 --> 00:41:00,956
It's a way
to memorialize a death

853
00:41:00,998 --> 00:41:02,695
and celebrate life
at the same time.

854
00:41:02,735 --> 00:41:04,729
What are we supposed to do?

855
00:41:04,774 --> 00:41:06,938
Well, drink, sing songs...

856
00:41:06,979 --> 00:41:11,081
laugh, cry,
talk about the deceased.

857
00:41:11,189 --> 00:41:14,287
It sounds almost Klingon.

858
00:41:19,275 --> 00:41:20,539
Hey.

859
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:22,241
Hey, yourself.

860
00:41:22,282 --> 00:41:25,483
When this is over...

861
00:41:25,523 --> 00:41:28,360
I want to talk to you
about something...

862
00:41:28,397 --> 00:41:30,391
something that's
been on my mind.

863
00:41:30,435 --> 00:41:31,529
Okay.

864
00:41:31,571 --> 00:41:34,100
Um, is it about me?

865
00:41:34,144 --> 00:41:37,345
Well, it-it's about
me, actually.

866
00:41:37,384 --> 00:41:39,685
Oh, that's a relief.

867
00:41:39,724 --> 00:41:42,561
I want to try to explain

868
00:41:42,598 --> 00:41:45,400
about my behavior lately.

869
00:41:45,438 --> 00:41:46,428
Oh...

870
00:41:46,473 --> 00:41:48,967
Sounds good to me.

871
00:41:49,013 --> 00:41:51,177
But we'll talk about it
over dinner.

872
00:41:51,218 --> 00:41:53,086
You cook.

873
00:41:53,122 --> 00:41:55,593
That's a deal.

874
00:41:55,629 --> 00:41:56,928
I, um...

875
00:41:58,001 --> 00:42:00,803
I just wanted to say
that, um...

876
00:42:00,841 --> 00:42:05,341
although I only talked with her
for a very short time

877
00:42:05,386 --> 00:42:09,385
I really admired Lisa Cusak.

878
00:42:09,428 --> 00:42:12,060
I cared about her
and I'm going to miss her.

879
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,543
And another thing.

880
00:42:15,577 --> 00:42:18,983
Contrary to public opinion

881
00:42:19,018 --> 00:42:22,925
I am not the arrogant,
self-absorbed

882
00:42:22,961 --> 00:42:25,957
God-like doctor
that I appear to be on occasion.

883
00:42:27,872 --> 00:42:31,108
Why don't I hear anybody
objecting to that statement?

884
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,445
Well, I will if you insist.

885
00:42:34,488 --> 00:42:35,684
I insist.

886
00:42:35,725 --> 00:42:37,126
Then I object.

887
00:42:37,161 --> 00:42:41,034
Thank you,
Miles Edward O'Brien.

888
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,038
No, I have a heart

889
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,517
and I really care
about all of you

890
00:42:47,553 --> 00:42:50,117
even though sometimes
it would appear

891
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:52,653
that I care more about my work.

892
00:42:54,436 --> 00:42:57,170
To the woman who, uh, taught me

893
00:42:57,209 --> 00:43:00,877
that it is sometimes necessary
to say these things...

894
00:43:00,918 --> 00:43:02,980
Lisa Cusak.

895
00:43:03,023 --> 00:43:05,085
- To Lisa.
- To Lisa.

896
00:43:11,945 --> 00:43:14,918
I never shook her hand...

897
00:43:14,952 --> 00:43:17,823
and I never saw her face...

898
00:43:17,859 --> 00:43:21,493
but she, she made me laugh...

899
00:43:21,534 --> 00:43:23,767
and she made me weep.

900
00:43:23,806 --> 00:43:26,277
She was all by herself

901
00:43:26,379 --> 00:43:28,977
and I was surrounded
by my friends.

902
00:43:29,019 --> 00:43:31,992
Yet I felt more alone
than she did.

903
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:36,800
We've grown apart,
the lot of us.

904
00:43:36,837 --> 00:43:38,740
We didn't mean for it to happen

905
00:43:38,776 --> 00:43:40,405
but it did.

906
00:43:40,446 --> 00:43:43,476
The war changed us.

907
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:45,424
It... pulled us apart.

908
00:43:47,363 --> 00:43:50,826
Lisa Cusak was my friend...

909
00:43:50,871 --> 00:43:53,342
but you are also my friends

910
00:43:53,411 --> 00:43:55,609
and I want my friends in my life

911
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:58,589
because someday
we're going to wake up

912
00:43:58,623 --> 00:44:00,149
and we're going to find

913
00:44:00,194 --> 00:44:02,826
that someone is missing
from this circle

914
00:44:02,867 --> 00:44:06,399
and on that day,
we're going to mourn...

915
00:44:06,442 --> 00:44:09,574
and we shouldn't
have to mourn alone.

916
00:44:09,616 --> 00:44:11,587
To Lisa

917
00:44:11,621 --> 00:44:14,058
and the sweet sound
of her voice.
