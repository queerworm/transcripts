1
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:09,884
ODO: All right, these barstools
will have to be removed.

2
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,302
Do you know how much they cost?

3
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,471
No, and I can't say I'm interested
in learning.

4
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:16,224
Station Regulation 2562, paragraph four:

5
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:18,768
"All furniture intended
for use on the Promenade

6
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,146
must not pose a danger to public safety."

7
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,105
What danger?

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,440
ODO: Without a back on the stool

9
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:24,941
Morn could tumble from his perch

10
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:27,027
at any moment, shattering
his upper vertebrae

11
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,987
or puncturing three or four of his lungs.

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:29,904
Nonsense.

13
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,783
His body weight is perfectly distributed
across the seat.

14
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:37,412
He's also better able to enjoy the view
of the lovely dabo girls

15
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:41,249
than he was before
and should he require another drink

16
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:43,501
he need only spin back.

17
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,295
Which points out another danger...

18
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:46,337
Vertigo.

19
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,674
This isn't going to give anybody vertigo.

20
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,136
Your appeal has been heard and rejected.

21
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,805
I want the barstools removed
by the end of the day.

22
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,476
Now, it's come to my attention
that your dabo wheel is in violation

23
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:03,021
of Station Regulation 4721,
which states...

24
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,773
-KIRA: Odo.
-Nerys.

25
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,150
-You busy?
-Not at all.

26
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,110
Well, then can I interest you
in some lunch?

27
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,070
Where shall we go?

28
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,696
I was thinking
about the Klingon restaurant.

29
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,281
KIRA: I haven't been there for ages,

30
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,784
and I have been craving
broiled krada legs.

31
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:20,163
Too bad about the barstools.
I kind of liked them.

32
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:23,708
Did you notice how he changed
the minute she walked into the room?

33
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,503
-They're in love.
-And what's love?

34
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,922
-Well, it's a--
-Love's a distraction.

35
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,634
And a distracted policeman is...

36
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,220
An opportunity.

37
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:41,893
SISKO: <i>Captain's Log,</i> <i>Stardate 51948.3.</i>

38
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:45,647
<i>With the safe arrival</i>
<i>of Convey PQ-One</i> <i>in the Vegan system</i>

39
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,983
<i>our escort duties</i> <i>are now complete</i>
<i>and I've set course for home.</i>

40
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:53,488
Well, my first and hopefully
last mission report for Starfleet Command.

41
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:57,033
You know, when I first agreed
to be Convoy Liaison Officer

42
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,453
I thought, "Sure, why not?
I know most of the freighter captains

43
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,413
in the convoy.
It should be a piece of cake."

44
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,208
I didn't know I'd be making 20 log entries

45
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,836
a day and filling out
formal reports every night.

46
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,380
Looks like you did a pretty good job.

47
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,590
Well, if you're going to do something,
do it right.

48
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,134
That's what my father used to say.

49
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:18,888
Every father says that. Even I say that.

50
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,809
That's why you're a good parent.
You know all the clichÃ©s by heart.

51
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,105
Well, hello, stranger.
Haven't seen you in days.

52
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,566
I've been filling out
reports for Starfleet Medical.

53
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,152
I knew there was a reason
why I didn't join Starfleet.

54
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,862
I--I, I couldn't do this paperwork.

55
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,280
Smart.

56
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,326
Well, there was a time
when you couldn't get him to shut up.

57
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,620
I think I like him better this way.

58
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,415
-That's mean.
-I was just kidding.

59
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,501
No. You weren't.

60
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,003
<i>Worf to Captain Sisko.</i>

61
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,754
Sisko here.

62
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,466
WORF: <i>Sir, can you come to the Bridge?</i>
<i>We have picked up a distress call.</i>

63
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,093
On my way.

64
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:11,274
We have been unable
to establish two-way communication so far

65
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,152
WORF: but we have determined
that the signal's coming from somewhere

66
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,528
in the Rutharian sector.

67
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,405
Let's hear it, Chief.

68
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,740
( beeping )

69
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,450
( communication static )

70
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:24,078
WOMAN: <i>and Commander Gatsby's dead, too.</i>
<i>I didn't see any other escape pods leave</i>

71
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,333
<i>before the ship was destroyed,</i>
<i>so I may be the only survivor.</i>

72
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:32,420
<i>My pod was torn open on impact</i>
<i>and the rain is pouring in.</i>

73
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,714
<i>I'll take the radio</i>
<i>and a survival kit with me</i>

74
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:38,843
<i>but the environmental suits were damaged</i>
<i>in the crash, so I-I'll have to rough it.</i>

75
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,137
<i>This is an L-Class world</i>

76
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,057
<i>and the atmosphere</i>
<i>is barely breathable out there.</i>

77
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:48,061
<i>Repeat, this is a general distress call.</i>

78
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,980
<i>I am a citizen </i>
<i>of the United Federation of Planets</i>

79
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:55,068
<i>and a Starfleet officer.</i>
<i>If you can hear me, please respond.</i>

80
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:58,279
<i>My government will reward you</i>
<i>for any assistance you can offer</i>

81
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:02,992
<i>and most of all,</i>
<i>you'll be my personal heroes.</i> <i>Repeat...</i>

82
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,786
-That's enough.
<i>-This is a general--</i>

83
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,372
How long will it take us to reach her?

84
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,625
At maximum warp, six days.

85
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,795
Any other ships closer to that sector?

86
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,505
No, sir.

87
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:21,052
Mr. Worf, turn us around
and set a course for the Rutharian sector.

88
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,470
Aye, sir.

89
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,852
Chief, I want you to establish
a two-way com link with this woman

90
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:37,193
and when you do, tell her...
tell her her "heroes" are on the way.

91
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:41,025
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>
<i>The marooned Starfleet officer,</i>

92
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,695
<i>whose name we've</i> <i>learned is Lisa</i>
<i>continues to transmit</i> <i>her call for help</i>

93
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:48,950
{\an8}<i>but so far Chief O'Brien</i> <i>has been unable</i>
<i>to establish</i> <i>two-way communication.</i>

94
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,785
{\an8}-How's it going?
-O'BRIEN: Slow.

95
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,872
{\an8}For some reason, she's transmitting
on a rotating subspace frequency.

96
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,583
{\an8}We're having a problem
trying to find a way to return her signal.

97
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,878
{\an8}-Do you have to keep that on all the time?
-No, not really.

98
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,422
{\an8}But she is all alone.

99
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,508
{\an8}The least I can do
is try and listen to her.

100
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,927
{\an8}She doesn't know you're listening, Miles.

101
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,720
{\an8}You're not comforting her
by keeping the channels open

102
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,180
{\an8}and driving yourself crazy.

103
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,390
{\an8}It doesn't bother me.

104
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,518
{\an8}Sometimes it feels like
she's actually talking to me.

105
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,145
{\an8}LISA: <i>For any assistance you can...</i>

106
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,146
{\an8}It's true.

107
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,982
{\an8}Especially when she talks
about her home or her family.

108
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,400
{\an8}She reminds me of my cousin.

109
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,568
{\an8}LISA: <i>Oh, no!</i>

110
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,572
{\an8}<i>I don't believe it. It's raining again.</i>

111
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,575
{\an8}<i>How can there be so much water</i>
<i>and so little life out there?</i>

112
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,118
{\an8}I think I'll leave you two alone.

113
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,454
{\an8}LISA: <i>I'm really starting</i>
<i>to hate this place.</i>

114
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:41,043
{\an8}<i>Repeat, this is a general distress call.</i>
<i>Hello? Is anyone paying attention?</i>

115
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,046
{\an8}<i>I know you're out there.</i>
<i>I know you can hear me.</i>

116
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,633
{\an8}<i>So just answer me.</i>
<i>Tell me you're on your way.</i>

117
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:52,346
<i>Tell me I'm going to be rescued.</i>
<i>Tell me I'm not going to die alone.</i>

118
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,984
I hope you're satisfied.

119
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,989
I'm sure nothing gives you more pleasure
than stifling my creativity.

120
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:10,907
( <i>scoffs </i>)

121
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:16,162
Only you would consider barstools
to be a form of artistic expression.

122
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,706
Oh, yeah? Let's see how creative you are.

123
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,460
Have you... picked out
the Major's gift yet?

124
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:24,879
Gift?

125
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,340
For this Saturday.

126
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,928
You do know what Saturday is, right?

127
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,140
-Saturday?
-Yes.

128
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:40,269
It's the one-month anniversary
of your first date with Major Kira.

129
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:46,484
-Oh... I suppose it is.
-And you haven't picked out a gift.

130
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,903
Why should I?

131
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:53,658
The man's experienced unrequited love
for the better part of three years

132
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,287
and now that he finally has her
he wants to know why

133
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,747
he should celebrate their anniversary.

134
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,416
Whatever you're trying
to sell me, it won't work.

135
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,877
Do you think I'm going to get involved?
No, thank you.

136
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,546
The last thing I want to deal with...

137
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,258
Is a panicked lover looking
for a gift at the last minute.

138
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,679
There's a whole Promenade
of shopkeepers out there

139
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,138
if you want to buy a gift.

140
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:21,644
Hmm. A one-month
anniversary gift. ( chuckles )

141
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,522
Did you ever hear
of anything so ridiculous?

142
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,388
-JAKE: Okay. So now you--
-Shh!

143
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,265
( quietly ) Now you have him
looking for a gift.

144
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,474
What are you up to?

145
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,310
I tell you, you write it down

146
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,770
the next thing I know,
I'm in a holding cell.

147
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:08,649
I won't write a word, I promise.
This is just character research.

148
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,901
-Right.
-Quark, listen.

149
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:14,071
I'm working on a crime novel
but I've hit a wall in my writing.

150
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:19,201
It's... it's not truthful anymore,
phony, artificial.

151
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,580
I'm having trouble creating
real flesh-and-blood characters

152
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,043
especially nefarious ones.
If you could just let me

153
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:31,797
watch and listen as you pull off...
whatever it is you're going to pull off,

154
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,343
it could really help me out.
You could give me insight.

155
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:38,095
I could even model
my lead character after you.

156
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:44,810
Lesson Number One,
No one involved in an extra-legal activity

157
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:49,190
-thinks of himself as nefarious.
-Sorry.

158
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,359
I'm a businessman, okay?

159
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,865
Now... if you're interested
in learning more about my business...

160
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,786
I think that could be arranged.

161
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,287
Great.

162
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:11,337
But nothing you see or hear
turns up in print

163
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:15,091
and none of it... none of it...
gets back to your father, understand?

164
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,051
Completely.

165
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,054
LISA: <i>So there is a sun after all.</i>

166
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,723
<i>Of course, now that the sun is up, </i>
<i>I can see</i>

167
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,267
<i>how truly ugly my new little home is.</i>

168
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,145
<i>There's nothing out there</i>
<i>but dirt and some rocks</i>

169
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,189
<i>and some more dirt and some more rocks.</i>

170
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,482
-Chief?
-Uh-huh?

171
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:36,028
-Can I ask you a personal question?
-Sure.

172
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:40,741
Are you uncomfortable
having me aboard the <i>Defiant?</i>

173
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:44,995
-No. Why should I be?
-Well, I'm a civilian.

174
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,832
Isn't it awkward having me
aboard a warship?

175
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,960
Oh, we've had civilians aboard before.
Doesn't bother me.

176
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,753
I was afraid you were going to say that.

177
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,381
LISA : <i>I can hear you! I'm sorry?</i>
<i>Hello? Don't worry about...</i>

178
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,007
O'BRIEN: Hold on a minute.

179
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,843
LISA: <i>Receiving your transmission. </i>
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

180
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,136
Hello?

181
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,554
( <i>transmission clears) Hello?</i>

182
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,432
<i>I could hear you two talking.</i>
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

183
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,267
Yes! Yes, we can hear you.

184
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,645
<i>Thank God.</i>
<i>Whoever you are, I love you.</i>

185
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,356
( laughing )

186
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,863
<i>My name's Lisa Cusak.</i>
<i>Until a couple of days ago,</i>

187
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,865
<i>I was the commanding officer</i>
<i>of the </i>Olympia.

188
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:21,949
SISKO: The <i>Olympia?</i>

189
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,201
<i>We left the Federation</i>
<i>over eight years ago</i>

190
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,495
<i>for a long-range exploration</i>
<i>of the Beta Quadrant.</i>

191
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,539
SISKO: What happened
to your ship, Captain?

192
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:32,251
LISA: <i>We were finally heading home,</i>
<i>if you can believe that</i>

193
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,171
<i>but then we picked up some strange energy </i>
<i>readings</i> <i>in a nearby star system</i>

194
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,715
<i>and I decided to stop and investigate.</i>

195
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,676
<i>We found an energy barrier</i>
<i>around the fourth planet</i>

196
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:44,555
<i>that was unlike anything we'd ever seen</i>
<i>and when we probed it with our scanners</i>

197
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,265
<i>it triggered a quantum reaction.</i>

198
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,018
<i>There was an enormous surge</i>
<i>of metreon radiation</i>

199
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,395
<i>that disabled our engines.</i>
<i>The next thing I knew</i>

200
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:55,274
<i>we were spiraling in toward the surface.</i>
<i>I gave the order to abandon ship</i>

201
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,861
<i>and the last thing I remember</i>
<i>is a console exploding in my face.</i>

202
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:03,824
<i>I woke up in an escape pod on the surface</i>
<i>and I've spent the last day and a half</i>

203
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,076
<i>sitting in this cave trying</i>
<i>to raise someone on subspace.</i>

204
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,746
Captain, Dr. Bashir,
Chief Medical Officer.

205
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:12,041
Your message said that you
were on an L-Class planet.

206
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,459
-Are you sure?
-<i>Positive,</i>

207
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,377
<i>and to answer your next question</i>

208
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,255
<i>yes, I've been giving myself</i>
<i>15cc's of tri-ox</i>

209
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,842
<i>every four hours to compensate</i>
<i>for the excess carbon dioxide</i>

210
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,137
<i>in the atmosphere,</i>
<i>just like it says in my medical tricorder.</i>

211
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,931
How much tri-ox do you have left?

212
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,724
<i>One hundred and fifty milliliters.</i>

213
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:35,731
Will you reduce the dosage, Captain
to 8cc's every six hours?

214
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:38,108
We need to stretch out
your supply as long as possible.

215
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,486
What happens when
she runs out of the drug?

216
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,656
LISA: <i>That's a good question,</i>
<i>Doctor. What happens then?</i>

217
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:47,034
You will begin to experience
the effects of hypoxia

218
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,495
but before that happens,
the tri-ox compound

219
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:52,414
will have strengthened
your cardiopulmonary system

220
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,416
allowing you to better
withstand the effects.

221
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,377
LISA: <i>"Better withstand the effects."</i>

222
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:59,296
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>I'm going to be gasping for air</i>

223
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,216
<i>and turning different shades </i>
<i>of blue by the time you get here.</i>

224
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,843
Yes, I'm afraid so.

225
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,804
LISA: <i>Thanks for brightening my day.</i>

226
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:11,016
-Is there anything we can do?
-<i>There is, actually. I can't sleep.</i>

227
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,102
<i>I--I think the injections </i>
<i>are keeping me awake</i>

228
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,479
<i>and I haven't had anyone</i>
<i>to talk to for two days.</i>

229
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,065
We'll be able to help you
with that, Captain.

230
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,650
I'll have one of my officers

231
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:22,778
stay on the com line
with you at all times.

232
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,822
<i>And order them to enjoy it, too.</i>

233
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:25,906
Done.

234
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,367
<i>So, who's first?</i>

235
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,203
I think I'd better start.

236
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,788
Sounds good to me.

237
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:39,128
A lot has happened...
since you left, Captain.

238
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,717
SISKO: The Second Fleet hit
the Dominion forces

239
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,177
occupying Betazed three
times in the last month

240
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,388
but they keep sending in reinforcements

241
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,724
and fortifying their positions,
so we find it--

242
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:52,850
LISA: <i>Okay, okay...</i>

243
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,310
( coughing )

244
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,605
That's it, please. No more war news.
You're depressing me.

245
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,231
Oh, sorry.

246
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,401
LISA: <i>No. I'm sorry.</i>

247
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:05,821
<i>I'm sorry for you and me</i>
<i>and everyone in the Federation.</i>

248
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,490
<i>I can't believe we're at war.</i>

249
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,161
<i>Let's change the subject.</i>
<i>How about some good news?</i>

250
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,289
<i>Tell me there's still something</i>
<i>to look forward to when I get home.</i>

251
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,293
<i>Tell me people still fall in love</i>
<i>and get married and raise families.</i>

252
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,211
They do.

253
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:24,506
LISA: <i>Good, and what about you?</i>
<i>Are you married?</i>

254
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,050
No.

255
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,384
LISA: <i>Seeing anyone?</i>

256
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,053
<i>I mean, I hate to pry</i>
<i>but I'd like to think</i>

257
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,596
<i>that there's still something positive</i>

258
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,473
<i>in the life of a starship captain </i>
<i>these days.</i>

259
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,641
( sighs )

260
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,851
I am seeing someone.

261
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,730
LISA: <i>Oh, now we're talking.</i>
<i>Tell me about her. What's her name?</i>

262
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,273
Kasidy Yates.

263
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:45,152
Kasidy? Is she the same Kasidy
I spoke to earlier?

264
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,321
-That's her.
-<i>She one of your officers?</i>

265
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,492
No. Civilian. Freighter Captain.

266
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,037
LISA: Uh-oh. <i>Sounds like</i>
<i>you're having problems.</i>

267
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,247
Why would you say something like that?

268
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,250
<i>There's no joy in that voice </i>
<i>of yours, Ben.</i>

269
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,045
<i>In fact, the tension level</i>
<i>went up when you said her name.</i>

270
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,881
<i>You sounded more relaxed</i>
<i>when you were telling me about the war.</i>

271
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,428
<i>Ben, are you still there?</i>

272
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,847
( sighs ) Yes.

273
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:18,143
Yes, I'm still here. You just...

274
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,816
caught me off-guard... a little.

275
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,818
LISA: <i>I can tell.</i>

276
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:30,322
You know, back when I was a junior officer
I dated a civilian for six years.

277
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,408
( coughing ) <i>Want to hear about it?</i>

278
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,367
<i>Sure you do.</i>

279
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:38,080
<i>Why? Because it's a funny story</i>
<i>and one of us needs to cheer up.</i>

280
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,873
<i>So, we met on Andor.</i>

281
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,127
<i>I was assigned to the Federation</i>
<i>Embassy as an attachÃ©</i>

282
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,963
<i>and he was working in the Andorian </i>
<i>Agricultural Ministry.</i>

283
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,382
<i>Now, at first, I didn't want anything </i>
<i>to do with him.</i>

284
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,260
<i>He kept pointing his antennae at me</i>
<i>whenever I walked through his office</i>

285
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,387
<i>and I found that sort of rude.</i>

286
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,517
QUARK: Excuse me... coming through.
Excuse me, excuse me...

287
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,435
Odo.

288
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,521
Well... this is it.

289
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,273
Can I see it?

290
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,239
Oh... very nice.

291
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,700
The Major's gonna love it.

292
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,495
How are you gonna give it to her?

293
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,458
What sort of evening do you have planned?

294
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,044
I don't have anything planned.

295
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,380
Oh... fortunately for you,
there's still time.

296
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:35,929
Pick one.

297
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,140
A holosuite program?

298
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,393
It's your anniversary.
You have to do something special.

299
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,437
I bought her a gift.

300
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:49,193
Have it your way. But if it were me

301
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,946
and I had found true love
after a lifetime of searching...

302
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,117
every month would be worth celebrating.

303
00:17:59,161 --> 00:17:59,995
ODO: All right.

304
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,331
Let me look at those programs.

305
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:03,874
ODO: Come on.

306
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,557
Looks like the Constable's
going to be busy Saturday night.

307
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,226
I guess that means

308
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,520
he won't be following
me around the station

309
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,855
or watching the airlocks
for wanted criminals

310
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:30,526
or monitoring the cargo bays
for illegal transactions.

311
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:31,944
Well, he has deputies.

312
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:36,073
Deputies, I can handle.
With Odo out of the way

313
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,034
my biggest problem will be deciding...

314
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,412
what to do with all the money
I'm going to make!

315
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:47,126
LISA: <i>Both my sisters are teachers.</i>
<i>I don't know how they can do it.</i>

316
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,336
<i>Personally, I can't stand children.</i>

317
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,504
Uh-huh.

318
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,215
LISA: <i>I know, I know,</i>
<i>everybody loves children.</i>

319
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,466
<i>Not me.</i>

320
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:55,759
( distracted ) Yeah.

321
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,095
<i>What about you? You like children?</i>

322
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,471
Oh, yeah.

323
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,682
( unconvinced ) <i>Really?</i>

324
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,433
Yeah.

325
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:07,187
<i>You know, Doctor, I'm starting to think</i>
<i>that maybe, just maybe</i>

326
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,939
<i>you're not really paying attention to--</i>

327
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,150
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

328
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:15,195
<i>What's that?</i>
<i>There's something moving out there.</i>

329
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,198
<i>It's getting closer.</i>

330
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,283
BASHIR: What?

331
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:23,287
LISA: <i>Stay back.</i>
( terrified ) <i>No. Don't hurt me.</i>

332
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,663
Captain, what's going on?

333
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:30,252
( sobbing ) <i>Please, stay back.</i>
<i>No, don't...</i> ( screaming ) <i>No!</i>

334
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,970
Captain Cusak, can you hear me? Hello?

335
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,684
Hello? God...

336
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,895
DEEP VOICE: <i>She's gone.</i>

337
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,354
BASHIR: Who is this?

338
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,772
What have you done?

339
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,774
DEEP VOICE: <i>I have eaten her.</i>

340
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:53,859
What?

341
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,362
DEEP VOICE: <i>I've eaten her!</i>
<i>What difference does it make to you?</i>

342
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:04,578
<i>You weren't even listening to her.</i>
You have my sincere apologies.

343
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,164
I was carried away with my work.

344
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:10,626
LISA: <i>I'm a patient, aren't I?</i>
<i>Doesn't that make me part of your work?</i>

345
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,586
BASHIR: You're right,
you're absolutely right.

346
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,171
I don't know what I was thinking.

347
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,175
You now have my complete attention.

348
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,593
LISA: ( sighs )

349
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,263
<i>Well, I've got news for you, Doc.</i>
<i>I'm all talked out.</i>

350
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,724
<i>It's time for you</i>
<i>to cheer up one of your patients</i>

351
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,517
<i>and take her mind off her impending doom.</i>

352
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,977
You're not doomed.

353
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,395
LISA: <i>I feel better already.</i>

354
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,649
<i>See how easy that was? Now keep going.</i>

355
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,443
BASHIR: Oh, what should I talk about?

356
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,862
LISA: <i>How did they let you</i>
<i>out of medical school</i>

357
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:42,324
<i>with this kind of bedside manner?</i>
<i>Are you sure you're a doctor?</i>

358
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,285
BASHIR: Yes, I graduated
second in my class, in fact.

359
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,372
LISA: <i>Oh. And we're especially</i>
<i>proud of that, aren't we?</i>

360
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,168
I get the feeling that
it's going to take me some hours

361
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,379
to crawl out of this rather sizable hole

362
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,672
I've dug for myself.

363
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,549
LISA: <i>Not at all. It'll take you days.</i>

364
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,723
You have my personal assurance
they're high-quality crystals

365
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:10,060
and you won't get them at this price
anywhere else in the Quadrant.

366
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,061
( coughs )

367
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,276
( softly ) Five days,
Cargo Bay 3. See you then.

368
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,531
I'll take this one.

369
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:28,328
Ah... "Paris, 1928." Nice choice.

370
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:32,791
Say what you will about humans today,
their past was certainly...

371
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:33,875
( whispering ) romantic.

372
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,920
Well, book us four hours
starting at 2100 on Sunday night.

373
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,213
You mean Saturday.

374
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,757
I mean Sunday.

375
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,885
But Saturday's the anniversary
of your first date.

376
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,806
Yes, but our first date ended badly.
It's not something I want to commemorate

377
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:51,268
so I've decided to celebrate
the anniversary of our first kiss.

378
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:55,272
-Your first kiss?
-Romantic, isn't it? ( chuckles )

379
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,273
Aw...

380
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,324
( beeping )

381
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,700
Come on.

382
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:07,784
( beeping )

383
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:08,952
Come on.

384
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:09,953
( beeping continues )

385
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,039
-What's going on?
-QUARK: My partner,

386
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,166
I can't get him on the channel.

387
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,667
( sighs )

388
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:20,130
-He's changed his com system protocols.
-Already? You just talked to him.

389
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,091
He's a wanted man, Jake.
He has to be very careful

390
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:26,094
about how often he uses subspace.
The authorities might try

391
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,345
and trace his signal.

392
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,181
( sighs )

393
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:34,853
I have no way of contacting him
until he gets here Saturday night.

394
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:37,481
Well, can't you just explain
to him that he'll have to wait

395
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:38,482
another day?

396
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:41,777
Haven't you been paying attention?
If he even sets foot on the station

397
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,362
while Odo's on duty,
we'll both be in a holding cell

398
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,615
faster than you can say
"criminal conspiracy."

399
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,909
( sighs )

400
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,621
Then, what are you going to do?

401
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,247
Th--think.

402
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:58,752
My best option is, uh... um...

403
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,837
Panic.

404
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,714
( sighs )

405
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,180
When the fighting first
broke out, I thought to myself

406
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,432
"All right, O'Brien,
you've done this before.

407
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,812
"Keep your head down...

408
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:20,857
"focus on the job
and you'll get through this,

409
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,275
just like you did in the last war."

410
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,320
But this war is different.

411
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,489
( chuckling ) Maybe I'm different.

412
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,201
I have this...

413
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:35,831
This growing sense of isolation.
I see people.

414
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,959
I... talk to them,
I laugh with them, and...

415
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,962
But some part of me is always saying...

416
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,467
"They may not be here tomorrow.

417
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,012
Don't get too close."

418
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:56,101
I'm sorry. I... I'm sorry,

419
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,186
I shouldn't be laying
all this on your shoulders, Captain.

420
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,398
LISA:<i> No, no, it's all right,</i>
<i>Miles. I don't mind.</i>

421
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,567
<i>Sounds like you really need</i>
<i>to talk with someone about this.</i>

422
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,944
I'm sure it's the last thing
you need to hear.

423
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:08,280
I should be cheering you up.

424
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,700
<i>Forget about me.</i>
<i>You're the one who needs cheering up.</i>

425
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,285
( sighs )

426
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,203
Now, there's a sad state of affairs.

427
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,165
<i>Look, you've seen a lot</i>
<i>of combat in the last year.</i>

428
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,542
<i>That's a heavy burden to carry around.</i>

429
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,795
Are you sure you're a Captain,
not a Counselor?

430
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,338
LISA: <i>Oh, I'm sure.</i>

431
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,966
<i>I'll let you in on a little secret, Miles.</i>

432
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,468
<i>I dislike the whole concept</i>
<i>of a ship's counselor.</i>

433
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,053
Me, too.

434
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,389
I mean, I--I like some of them
personally, but--

435
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:36,892
LISA: <i>But sometimes</i>
<i>they just get in the way.</i>

436
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:41,479
That's exactly how I feel,
but saying it out loud is almost heresy.

437
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,941
And there's this assumption
nowadays that...

438
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,526
only someone with a diploma

439
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,863
can listen to your problems
or give you advice.

440
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,324
LISA: <i>Sometimes, all you need</i>
<i>are good friends.</i>

441
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,575
Exactly.

442
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,035
LISA: <i>So where are they?</i>

443
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,536
What? Excuse me?

444
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,998
LISA: <i>Where are your friends, Miles?</i>
<i>Why aren't they helping you through this?</i>

445
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,628
Well, we, uh...

446
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:07,214
I haven't spoken to them
about any of this.

447
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,217
You know, it's not the kind
of thing you talk about.

448
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:14,346
LISA: <i>Hmm. Well, if you can't</i>
<i>talk to your friends</i>

449
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:17,641
and you can't talk to your wife,
you know who that leaves.

450
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,769
-A ship's counselor.
-<i>A ship's counselor.</i>

451
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,395
( Cusak coughing )

452
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,398
BASHIR: <i>Excuse me, but it's 1800 hours.</i>

453
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,608
Already?

454
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:27,901
Afraid so.

455
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,361
O'BRIEN: But we're still talking.

456
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:31,613
LISA: <i>Boys, boys, don't fight over me.</i>

457
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,949
( coughing ) <i>Miles, I'll talk to you </i>
<i>in the morning.</i>

458
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,617
And think about what I said.

459
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:41,957
All right.
And I will. Good night, Captain.

460
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,083
LISA: <i>Good night.</i>

461
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,170
<i>Well, Julian, don't let me</i>
<i>keep you from your work.</i>

462
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,588
<i>I know how busy you are.</i>

463
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,590
No work tonight.

464
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,969
LISA: <i>Oh! So you've decided</i>
<i>to spend your valuable time</i>

465
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,389
<i>conversing with your patient again.</i>
<i>That's three days in a row.</i>

466
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,683
<i>You must be swamped with paperwork by now.</i>

467
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,644
<i>I feel awful, keeping you</i>
<i>from your duties like this.</i>

468
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,688
I managed to catch up
with all my paperwork this afternoon

469
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:05,772
thank you very much.

470
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,482
LISA: <i>Let me guess,</i>

471
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:10,777
<i>thanks to your amazing</i>
<i>genetically engineered brain</i>

472
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,445
<i>you not only did your work</i>

473
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,240
<i>you did the work of ten</i>
<i>other doctors at the same time.</i>

474
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,157
Well?

475
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,159
But you've answered the next question

476
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,745
I was going to ask you,
which is "how are you feeling?"

477
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,748
I can hear that you're in your usual
acerbic good mood.

478
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,876
LISA: <i>Wrong again, my superhuman friend.</i>

479
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,796
<i>As a matter of fact,</i>
<i>I'm not feeling well at all.</i>

480
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,131
Tell me.

481
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,009
LISA: <i>The last injection</i>
<i>didn't do the trick.</i>

482
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:38,221
<i>I feel this heavy weight on my chest.</i>
<i>It's getting harder to breathe</i>

483
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:42,225
<i>and every time I move my head,</i>
<i>the cave starts spinning.</i>

484
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,227
( <i>door chimes </i>)

485
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,228
SISKO: Come in.

486
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:48,148
What is it?

487
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,275
Captain Cusak's run out of tri-ox.

488
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,527
She's beginning to feel
the effects of CO2 poisoning.

489
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,445
Already?

490
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,823
I thought she had at least
a day's worth of injections left.

491
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,700
So did I, but apparently the last vial

492
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,910
was tainted somehow,
probably in the crash.

493
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:04,748
-How long does she have?
-No more than two days.

494
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:09,294
That's not good.
We're still three days away.

495
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,680
-We need more speed.
-Speed's not the problem.

496
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,391
I could increase
the warp plasma 97 gigahertz.

497
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:28,146
That would increase our velocity to warp
9.5 and save us almost a full day.

498
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,356
WORF: The problem on the <i>Defiant </i>is

499
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:32,609
how to maintain structural integrity
when we go above warp nine.

500
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,569
Exactly. At those kind of speeds

501
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:37,197
the ship literally starts
tearing herself apart.

502
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,116
Is there any way to strengthen
the structural integrity field?

503
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,410
Not without bleeding power
from some other source.

504
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:43,495
SISKO: Such as?

505
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,122
-The phaser reserves.
-WORF: That would be unwise.

506
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,665
If we empty the defense reserves

507
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,417
we could find ourselves
at an extreme disadvantage

508
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,378
should we encounter a Dominion ship.

509
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,463
We're a long way from the front lines
out here, Worf.

510
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:56,007
The chances of meeting
a Dominion ship are negligible.

511
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,717
We should not take that risk.

512
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:00,512
She'll die if we do not get to her faster.

513
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:07,602
Use the phaser reserve, Chief.
Give us all the speed you can.

514
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,270
Aye, sir. Thank you, sir.

515
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,571
How's it going?

516
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,281
We're increasing speed.

517
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,784
The Captain's condition is worsening.

518
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:23,743
I see.

519
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,830
-Is there anything I can do?
-I don't think so.

520
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,376
Well, I guess I'll see you later.

521
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,711
-Right.
-Right.

522
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,263
Are you sure you want to hear about this?

523
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,931
LISA: ( weakly ) <i>Trust me, Ben.</i>

524
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:47,225
<i>I'd much rather be worrying</i>
<i>about your love life</i>

525
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,977
<i>than about my own problems right now.</i>

526
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,230
( coughing )

527
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:56,776
Well, when Kasidy came
to the Bridge last night

528
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:02,157
all I wanted her to do was leave
and I couldn't tell you why.

529
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:06,244
LISA: <i>She doesn't belong there, Ben. </i>
<i>That's why.</i>

530
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:09,914
<i>She doesn't belong in that part</i>
<i>of your life, and you know it.</i>

531
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:13,501
<i>Off duty, I'm sure Kasidy</i>
<i>is exactly what you need</i>

532
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,421
<i>but on the Defiant,</i>
<i>she's a random element...</i>

533
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:17,964
( coughs )

534
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,842
<i>a piece that doesn't fit</i>
<i>anywhere in the puzzle.</i>

535
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,013
( sighs )

536
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:28,767
She was the Convoy Liaison
Officer on our last mission

537
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,602
and a damned good one, too.

538
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:33,104
LISA: <i>This isn't about her.</i>

539
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,731
<i>This is about you.</i>

540
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,858
<i>You're having trouble doing your job</i>

541
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,569
<i>when she's on the Defiant,</i>
<i>and that's a problem.</i>

542
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:44,115
<i>It's also affecting your relationship</i>
<i>and that's another problem.</i>

543
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,034
<i>Don't take it so hard.</i>

544
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:49,704
<i>So, you can't mix your personal</i>
<i>life and your professional life.</i>

545
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,706
<i>Most people can't.</i>

546
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,833
<i>I certainly can't.</i>

547
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,961
<i>I once served on the same</i>
<i>starbase as my sister.</i>

548
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,755
<i>Oh, what a nightmare that was.</i>

549
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,089
( coughs )

550
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,634
I look forward to meeting you, Lisa.

551
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:07,055
I'm sure I'm not the only one
around here who feels the same way.

552
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,515
<i>If you ask me...</i>

553
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,974
( coughs )

554
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:13,561
<i>Everyone on that ship could use some R&amp;R.</i>

555
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,021
( coughing )

556
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:22,946
Beautiful, aren't they?

557
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:24,656
Gorgeous.

558
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,535
Do you know how much
I was going to get for these?

559
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,538
Almost 200 bars.

560
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:35,708
-That's a lot.
-No kidding. That's a lot.

561
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:39,546
Now... they're just a crate full of junk.

562
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,592
You know, there's still a chance
that Odo won't find out about any of this.

563
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,762
No, he'll find out.

564
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,475
Odo would love nothing better
than to see me in jail.

565
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,271
And after all I did for him.

566
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:57,981
Like what?

567
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:03,027
Like helping him find true love.

568
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,614
That's right. If it wasn't for me

569
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,575
he and Major Kira
would never have gotten together

570
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:09,701
in the first place.

571
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,996
I was there for him

572
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:16,040
during all the heartache
and the lonely nights.

573
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:20,420
When he was wallowing in misery
because she was still seeing Shakaar.

574
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,839
I told him to make his move.

575
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,010
I told him not to give up.

576
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,805
I was there for him.

577
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:40,273
And what did I get out of it? Nothing.
He still spies on me. He still bothers me

578
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:42,400
about minor infractions of the law.

579
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,696
And he still can't wait
for the opportunity

580
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,656
to send me to prison.

581
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:56,998
I should have remembered
the 285th Rule of Acquisition.

582
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:03,880
"No good deed ever goes unpunished."

583
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:51,344
To failure.
I'm not drinking to that.

584
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:57,642
Jake, in ten minutes
my business partner's ship will dock.

585
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,728
In 15 minutes, Odo will arrest him.

586
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,606
In 20 minutes, my name will come up.

587
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:08,820
And in 25 minutes, Odo will walk
in here with a warrant.

588
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,490
I think you should humor me on this one.

589
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,881
Quark...

590
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,802
I'd like that holosuite now after all.

591
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,346
-You would.
-QUARK: That's right.

592
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:41,060
Turns out Nerys agrees with you.
She wants to celebrate the anniversary

593
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,063
of our first date, not our first kiss.
So here we are.

594
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,151
Is the holosuite still available?

595
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:51,446
It's, um... it's all yours.

596
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,741
The program?

597
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,503
Odo?

598
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,214
Have a good time.

599
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,467
Thank you, Quark.
I'm sure we will.

600
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:18,598
-I don't believe it.
-Neither do I.

601
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:24,645
I'm going to win this one, Jake.
You know what the best part is?

602
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:29,275
I beat Odo. I finally beat him.

603
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,279
Jake, I did it. I've beat him.

604
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:39,577
Well, he looks happy. He should be.

605
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,996
He's about to make
his biggest profit of the year.

606
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,501
I don't know, Odo.

607
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,379
You sure you want to let him get away
with smuggling Denevan crystals?

608
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,048
I owe him one.

609
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:56,636
So he'll get this one, but just this one.

610
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:03,351
Why is it every time
I think I have you figured out

611
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,228
you do something to surprise me?

612
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,687
Like tonight.

613
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:10,817
Where did you get the idea to celebrate
our one-month anniversary in Paris?

614
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:16,781
Well, some mysteries
are better left unsolved.

615
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:36,300
I want a complete scan of that barrier
but use passive sensors only, gentlemen.

616
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,053
An active scan is what triggered
the destruction of the <i>Olympia.</i>

617
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,179
Aye, sir.

618
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,722
It appears to be an exogenic field

619
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,308
generated by the unstable
elements in the planet's core.

620
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:49,397
Captain Cusak just lost consciousness.
She's in the last stages of CO2 poisoning.

621
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,565
If she's got any chance at all

622
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,775
we have to get her to Sick Bay
in the next 45 minutes.

623
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,529
O'BRIEN: Captain, there's no way
the <i>Defiant </i>can penetrate the barrier.

624
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,116
The energy's composed
of subspace metreon radiation.

625
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:02,326
If we get anywhere near it

626
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,537
the dilithium matrix
in the warp core will collapse

627
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,205
and we'll be pulled down
onto the planet's surface

628
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,540
just like the <i>Olympia.</i>

629
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,968
-Options?
-Could we beam through it?

630
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:20,845
No. We can't get close enough
to the barrier

631
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:21,929
to initiate transport.

632
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:23,598
What about a shuttlepod?

633
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,641
Their impulse engines
don't use antimatter.

634
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,269
It is unlikely that a shuttle
could withstand

635
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,730
the gravimetric stresses
that are within the barrier.

636
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,648
Unlikely but not impossible.

637
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,611
I didn't come all this way to give up.

638
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,738
I'll take the risk.

639
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:42,200
Doctor, Mr. O'Brien, you're with me.
Mr. Worf, you have the Bridge.

640
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,492
WORF: Aye, sir.

641
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,227
Sisko to <i>Defiant.</i>
We're preparing to enter the barrier.

642
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,229
WORF:<i> Acknowledged. Good luck, Captain.</i>

643
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,230
Thank you, Commander.

644
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,110
Shields down to 73 percent.

645
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,698
Primary power grid off-line.
Switching to backups.

646
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,492
Shields at 50 percent.

647
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,535
We're losing the navigational computer.

648
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,537
BASHIR: Secondary nav comp on line.

649
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,872
We're coming out of it.

650
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,714
Damage report.

651
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,467
Some buckling
in the starboard hull plating

652
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,052
but otherwise, we're fine.

653
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,220
Scan the planet, Doctor.

654
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:47,473
Not showing any life sign.

655
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:52,395
Wait. I found the crash site...
and the cave.

656
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,772
SISKO: Is there somewhere
we can set down nearby?

657
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:55,856
Yes.

658
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,442
-How are we for time?
-It's going to be tight.

659
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,735
We've got to get her in the shuttle

660
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,404
and back on the ship in 20 minutes.

661
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,455
Still no life readings.

662
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:56,500
This has to be the only direction
she could have been headed in.

663
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,765
BASHIR: Over here.

664
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,518
( <i>tricorder beeping </i>)

665
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,280
It was a human female...

666
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:33,037
Fifty one years of age at time of death.
Cause of death

667
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,206
carbon dioxide poisoning.

668
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,794
SISKO: It can't be Lisa.
That woman's been dead for years.

669
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:44,298
BASHIR: Three years and two months
but all the evidence fits.

670
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:48,636
Age, rank... the way she died.

671
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:54,850
If she's been dead for three years
how has she been talking to us?

672
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,728
It must have something
to do with the energy barrier.

673
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:02,691
When her subspace radio signal
passed through the metreon radiation

674
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:06,362
in the barrier, the signal somehow
time-shifted into the future.

675
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:10,116
Then when you sent the return signal?
It went through the barrier

676
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:12,034
and traveled back in time in the same way.

677
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,414
We've been talking
to someone from the past?

678
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,168
So what do we do now?

679
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,297
We should bury her.

680
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:33,597
No, not here. Not alone in this cave.

681
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:39,145
We'll take her back with us...
give her a proper burial...

682
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,605
among friends.

683
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,661
( muted conversation )

684
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:59,707
It's called an Irish wake.
It's a way to memorialize a death

685
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,791
and celebrate life at the same time.

686
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,294
What are we supposed to do?

687
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:09,467
Well, drink, sing songs...
Laugh, cry, talk about the deceased.

688
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:12,636
It sounds almost Klingon.

689
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:18,767
Hey.

690
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,478
Hey, yourself.

691
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,898
When this is over...

692
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:29,028
I want to talk to you about something,
something that's been on my mind.

693
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,196
Okay.

694
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,615
Um, is it about me?

695
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,534
Well, it--it's about me, actually.

696
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,912
Oh, that's a relief.

697
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:43,667
I want to try to explain
about my behavior lately.

698
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,044
Oh...

699
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:49,381
Sounds good to me.
But we'll talk about it over dinner.

700
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,175
You cook.

701
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:53,844
That's a deal.

702
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:57,515
BASHIR: I, um...
( clears throat ) I just wanted to say

703
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,807
that, um...

704
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:03,604
although I only talked with her
for a very short time

705
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:07,483
I really admired Lisa Cusak.

706
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,777
I cared about her
and I'm going to miss her.

707
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,280
And another thing.

708
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,201
Contrary to public opinion

709
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:21,247
I am not the arrogant, self-absorbed

710
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,250
God-like doctor that I appear
to be on occasion.

711
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,296
Why don't I hear anybody
objecting to that statement?

712
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,758
Well, I will if you insist.

713
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:35,427
-I insist.
-Then I object.

714
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:38,973
Thank you, Miles Edward O'Brien.

715
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:45,813
No, I have a heart
and I really care about all of you

716
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:50,651
even though sometimes it would appear
that I care more about my work.

717
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,447
To the woman who, uh, taught me

718
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:58,742
that it is sometimes necessary
to say these things,

719
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:00,953
Lisa Cusak.

720
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,330
-To Lisa.
-To Lisa.

721
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:15,467
I never shook her hand...
and I never saw her face...

722
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:21,432
but she, she made me laugh...
and she made me weep.

723
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:26,770
She was all by herself
and I was surrounded by my friends.

724
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:30,274
Yet I felt more alone than she did.

725
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:35,362
We've grown apart, the lot of us.

726
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:38,073
We didn't mean for it to happen
but it did.

727
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:43,329
The war changed us, pulled us apart.

728
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:48,459
Lisa Cusak was my friend...

729
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:53,839
but you are also my friends
and I want my friends in my life

730
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:58,510
because someday we're going to wake up
and we're going to find

731
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:03,641
that someone is missing from this circle
and on that day, we're going to mourn...

732
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,561
and we shouldn't have to mourn alone.

733
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:12,316
To Lisa and the sweet sound of her voice.
