1
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:05,130
So, there I was...

2
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:08,258
fighting the toughest battle
of my life...

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,886
looking around,
hoping to spot a friendly face

4
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:13,931
only to discover
my colleagues...

5
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:17,017
were gone.
I was alone.

6
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:20,061
I admit for a moment there
I considered giving up.

7
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,815
I could feel
the seconds ticking away--

8
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,399
panic building up
inside of me.

9
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:27,486
I knew my only chance
was to trust my instincts,

10
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,029
so I closed my eyes...

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,991
took a deep breath,

12
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,910
and just like that,
it came to me--

13
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:37,621
the answer I was looking for--

14
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,623
a pericardial membrane!

15
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,750
Oh!
I looked down

16
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,753
and punched the answer
into my computer terminal

17
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,964
just as the buzzer sounded,
ending the exam,

18
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:49,008
and that, I suppose

19
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:52,135
is the stuff
salutatorians are made of.

20
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,929
Salutatorian?

21
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:58,767
Well, I mistook
a preganglionic fiber

22
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:01,937
for a postganglionic nerve
during the orals,

23
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:05,024
or I would have been
valedictorian.

24
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,942
It was a trick question.

25
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:08,527
Fascinating.

26
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,530
Not nearly as fascinating
as when I...

27
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,615
SISKO:
<i>Dr. Bashir, Chief O'Brien.</i>

28
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:16,326
<i>Report to Landing Pad Five.</i>

29
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,119
Bad timing.

30
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,622
There'll be another time.

31
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,923
Starfleet medical finals.

32
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:31,216
Gets them every time.

33
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,887
(<i> grunting</i> )

34
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:37,973
It's no use.
Chief!

35
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,516
We have to get
this hatch open.

36
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,518
Lieutenant Dax and Ensign Pauley
are trapped in there.

37
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,896
The runabout barely made it back
through the wormhole.

38
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,856
By the time they docked
power levels were near zero.

39
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:47,942
There's not even enough juice
left in the ship

40
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:49,985
to release the servos.
Life support's down.

41
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,195
Oxygen levels have dropped
dangerously low.

42
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,364
Have to burn it through.
Forget it, major.

43
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:55,866
The hatch is made
of duranium composite.

44
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,576
It'll take you an hour
to get through it.

45
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,620
We don't have that much time.
That's odd.

46
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,205
How many passengers did you say
were on board the<i> Ganges?</i>

47
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,999
Two.
I'm reading three.

48
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,876
O'BRIEN:
We need to get power
to the hatch servos.

49
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,003
Major, hand me
the EPI capacitor.

50
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,964
There, middle shelf.

51
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,430
(<i> powering up</i> )

52
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,891
(<i> beeping</i> )
Try her now.

53
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,898
(<i> grunting</i> )

54
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,028
Dax?

55
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,072
I'm fine.
Check the others.

56
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,954
Vash?
That's right.

57
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:45,332
Miles O'Brien,
from the<i> Enterprise.</i>

58
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,751
Oh. Yes, of course.

59
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,503
What are you doing
on the<i> Ganges?</i>

60
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,922
We found her
in the Gamma Quadrant.

61
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,966
She'd been there
for over two years.

62
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:55,425
Two years?

63
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,969
Doctor, we'd better
get these people

64
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,054
over to the infirmary.

65
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,141
Right this way.

66
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,983
O'BRIEN:
How did you get to the Gamma
Quadrant two years ago?

67
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,985
A friend
dropped me off.

68
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,319
Oh.

69
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,323
Will I live?

70
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,325
You're fine.

71
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,493
In fact...

72
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:29,288
you're in
remarkable shape.

73
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,249
Thank you, doctor.
I try.

74
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,002
Well, I-I-I-I mean
you've, uh...

75
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,377
managed quite well

76
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,005
considering you've
been out of contact

77
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,174
with civilization
for over two years.

78
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:43,135
Well, I'd hardly call
the Gamma Quadrant uncivilized.

79
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,845
Some of the cultures
I've encountered

80
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,306
have histories dating back
millions of years.

81
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:50,391
Really? I'd love
to hear about them.

82
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,520
I mean, we have no idea
what's beyond the wormhole.

83
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,230
Well, maybe I'll write a book.

84
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:58,108
Well, it's sure to be a
best-seller around here.

85
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,443
I... well... um...

86
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:04,031
no sign of disease
or malnutrition

87
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,074
or parasitic infections.

88
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,409
You sound disappointed.

89
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,329
I am.

90
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:13,081
Now I have no reason
to keep you here.

91
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:17,169
Well, you almost make me wish
I wasn't feeling well.

92
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,427
(<i> sighing</i> )

93
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,388
And she claims she knew nothing
about the wormhole?

94
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,432
She did seem very surprised
when I told her about it.

95
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,726
I don't think she ever expected

96
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,686
to see this part
of the galaxy again.

97
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,271
How could she get there
in the first place

98
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,981
if she didn't go
through the wormhole?

99
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,317
She said she didn't
want to talk about it.

100
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:42,652
Said it was
a personal matter.

101
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,321
This doesn't make sense--

102
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,573
a human alone in the Gamma
Quadrant for two years.

103
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,200
Let's check her background.

104
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,784
See what we can
find out about her.

105
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,912
She claims to be
an archaeologist.

106
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,373
That's a good
place to start.

107
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,922
You sure this place is safe?

108
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,173
The Assay Office

109
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,384
is the most secure
area on the station.

110
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,844
The chambers are
surrounded on all sides

111
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,763
by individual
force fields.

112
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,806
And how are
the locks controlled?

113
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,893
Once you secure a chamber,
it can't be opened,

114
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,812
except with your personal
authorization code,

115
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:21,566
combined with a verified
retinal print.

116
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,277
A Cardassian MK-7 scanner?

117
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,945
MK-12.

118
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,614
With an L-90
enhanced resolution filter.

119
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:31,492
Well, I suppose
that will have to do.

120
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:37,165
Computer, begin inventory
for cubicle 19.

121
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,169
One statue...

122
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,879
stone.

123
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:47,592
30-odd centimeters tall,
approximately eight kilograms.

124
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,847
Assorted gems.

125
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,317
Gold necklace.

126
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,407
One dagger...
bronze and gold.

127
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,700
About 25 centimeters.

128
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,625
ASSAYER:
Beautiful.

129
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,795
I've never seen anything
quite like it.

130
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:27,090
Some kind of Promethean quartz.

131
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,092
I thought so, too, at first,

132
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,552
but its molecular density
and refraction index

133
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,846
is much higher.

134
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,182
Remarkable.

135
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,355
End inventory.

136
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:47,235
Please,
enter an access code.

137
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,989
(<i> beeping</i> )

138
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,209
(<i> cubicle closes</i> )

139
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,793
All right.

140
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,463
I'll be back tomorrow
to pick everything up.

141
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,548
I've booked passage
on the Mulzirak Transport.

142
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,009
You're not leaving us
so soon, are you?

143
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,136
I'm afraid so.

144
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,227
The Daystrom Institute
will be very disappointed.

145
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,895
The Daystrom Institute?

146
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,146
Their scientists
are anxious

147
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,856
to hear about life
in the Gamma Quadrant.

148
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,275
Every place you've been,
everything you've seen,

149
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,902
no matter
how insignificant,

150
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,571
could prove to be important,
including how you got there.

151
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,865
Sorry, Commander,
but that's a...

152
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,909
Personal matter.
...personal matter.

153
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:43,417
So now the Daystrom
Institute is
interested in me.

154
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,502
Well, that's ironic.

155
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:47,546
Professor Woo
seemed especially eager

156
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,423
to speak to you again.
Did he really?

157
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,591
I suppose he told you
he suspended my membership

158
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,885
from the Institute's
Archaeological Council?

159
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,220
On two occasions.

160
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,888
Something about the sale
of illegal artifacts.

161
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,306
Well, when it
comes to choosing

162
00:09:58,348 --> 00:09:59,766
between science
and profit

163
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,684
I'll choose profit
every time.

164
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,396
The professor was hoping you'd
make an exception in this case.

165
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:07,232
You know, I haven't
been back to Earth in...

166
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,608
it must be 12 years.

167
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,402
Here's your chance.

168
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,237
I could arrange passage.

169
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,490
I think I'd like that.

170
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,825
Fine. I'll take care of it.

171
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,338
I don't understand it,
Commander.

172
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,174
I can't find anything
wrong with her.

173
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,552
This ship is
completely functional.

174
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:37,011
It didn't look that way
this morning.

175
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,805
Oh, don't get me wrong.

176
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,640
The power reserves are empty.

177
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,351
The inertial damping fields
are barely operational,

178
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,145
and the warp drive
containment field's

179
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,396
on the verge of collapse.

180
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:47,897
But?

181
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,566
But there's nothing
wrong with any of them.

182
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:52,026
Once we put power
back into her,

183
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,736
she should be
fully operational.

184
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,863
Did you check the central
power linkages?

185
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,366
Yes, sir.
I ran a level-1 diagnostic.

186
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,077
Everything checks out.
I can't explain it.

187
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:04,498
It's like something
tapped into the ship's systems

188
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,374
and drained them dry.

189
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,592
Tell me, Chief, how well
do you know this woman Vash?

190
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:17,385
Hardly at all.
Only met her
that one time

191
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,803
she was aboard
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

192
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,054
What was she doing there?

193
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,099
Well, sir, Vash
and Captain Picard

194
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,476
were friends--

195
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,685
close friends,
if you follow my meaning.

196
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,231
Seems they met on Risa
a few years back.

197
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,650
I figure she must be
a special woman,

198
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,401
being friends with
the captain and all.

199
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,320
Somehow, she doesn't seem
to be his type.

200
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:39,533
Well, the captain likes
a good challenge, sir.

201
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,784
(<i> equipment powering down</i> )

202
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,668
Status report?

203
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,879
We suffered
a broad-spectrum power drain.

204
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,340
Power transfer is
completely inoperative.

205
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,551
The energy was drawn out
faster than it could handle.

206
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,093
I'll have to replace
the whole unit.

207
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,720
Chief, are you reading
any graviton flux

208
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,348
around the transfer systems?

209
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,808
I am detecting a low-level
graviton disturbance.

210
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,436
How did you know?
That's exactly what happened

211
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:11,314
when we lost power
on the<i> Ganges.</i>

212
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,327
These were originally
Cardassian living quarters.

213
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,621
The bed may take
some getting used to.

214
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:27,955
As an archaeologist,

215
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,625
I've spent half my life
sleeping in tents.

216
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,711
To me, any bed
will be a luxury.

217
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,128
You've obviously
never slept

218
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,214
on a Cardassian mattress.

219
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,593
If you need anything,
just ask the computer.

220
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:40,801
Thanks, Chief.

221
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,597
Oh, by the way,
how's Jean-Luc?

222
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,265
The Captain?
Mm-hmm.

223
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,141
The last time I saw
him, he was fine.

224
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:50,687
Well, now that I'm back,
I'll have to look him up.

225
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,430
Really, Vash,
I can't believe

226
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,766
you're still pining
for Jean-Luc--

227
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:30,435
that self-righteous
do-gooder.

228
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,146
I should have listened to him
when he warned me about you.

229
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,522
You're hurt,
you strike back,

230
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,232
I understand, but
be of good cheer.

231
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:38,943
I bring you wonderful
news-- I'm back.

232
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,403
And I can see now

233
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,155
it was cruel of me
to leave you.

234
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,991
Very touching, but you
didn't leave me, I left<i> you.</i>

235
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,993
You left me, I left you--
details, mere details.

236
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,536
The important thing is

237
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,538
we're back together
again-- a team.

238
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,624
Joined together at the hip.

239
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,832
Not a chance.

240
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,876
You know you're
going to miss me.

241
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,505
Don't flatter yourself.

242
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,257
You know, I thought

243
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,634
we'd first visit
the Teleris Cluster,

244
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,969
look in on the star
dancers at Mundahla

245
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,971
or maybe head over
to the Lantar Nebula

246
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,890
and view the Sampalo
relic on Hoek IV.

247
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,225
Not interested.

248
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:15,104
I know-- Vadris III,
charming little world.

249
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,523
The natives think they're

250
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,650
the only intelligent
life in the universe.

251
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:19,984
No!

252
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,866
All right.
You choose then.

253
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,952
I choose never to go anywhere
with you again, Q.

254
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,371
You don't know
what you're missing.

255
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,206
When we started this little
partnership,

256
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,916
I promised to take you places
no human had ever seen before.

257
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,502
And you have.

258
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,253
It was wonderful.

259
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,547
Thank you.

260
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,131
Now, goodbye.

261
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:45,218
Two years in the Gamma
Quadrant hardly qualifies

262
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,094
as a grand tour
of the universe.

263
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,723
There's still the Delta
Quadrant to explore,

264
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:52,350
not to mention all
the other galaxies.

265
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,935
It's over, Q.
I want you out of my life.

266
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,813
You are arrogant,
you're overbearing,

267
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,481
and you think
you know everything.

268
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,941
But I do know everything.

269
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,778
That makes it even worse.

270
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,029
All right, fine.

271
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,865
What is it you really want?

272
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,534
I want the life I had
before I met you.

273
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,830
And a stellar life, indeed.

274
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,540
The eminent Vash--

275
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:19,252
barred from the Royal Museum
of Epsilon Hydra VII.

276
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,254
Persona non grata
on Betazed.

277
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,963
Wanted dead on Myrmidon

278
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,717
for stealing the Crown
of the First Mother.

279
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,761
Dead or alive.

280
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,679
Preferably dead.

281
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:31,723
It's a wonder
you haven't offended

282
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,600
every sentient race
in the galaxy.

283
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,352
You're the one who almost got me
killed on Erriakang VII.

284
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,730
And they weren't
exactly thrilled
to see you on Brax either.

285
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,815
What did they call you,
"the god of lies"?

286
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,233
They meant it
affectionately.

287
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,610
(<i> door chimes</i> )

288
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,944
Come in.

289
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,196
I...

290
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,865
Go away.

291
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,408
Q, bring him back.

292
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,493
What business could
you possibly have

293
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,245
with that disgusting
little troll?

294
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,372
I don't know.
You didn't give him
time to tell me.

295
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:59,250
Now, bring him back
this instant.

296
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,043
All right.

297
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,799
Can I help you?

298
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,886
My name is Quark.

299
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:12,513
It's, uh, it's come
to my attention

300
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:16,726
that you have access
to certain... items.

301
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:21,105
Items that might perhaps
turn a tidy profit?

302
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,942
I'm listening.

303
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,277
For a percentage,

304
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:31,115
I might be able to arrange
a buyer for your trinkets,

305
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,118
perhaps an auction.

306
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,957
I'll only accept payment
in gold-pressed latinum.

307
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,418
I'll shower you
in it-- 50-50.

308
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,128
Mr. Quark, I believe

309
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,881
you are trying to take
advantage of me.

310
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,843
(<i> laughing</i> )

311
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,135
Some wine?

312
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,721
Oh, oh...

313
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,431
(<i> moaning in pleasure</i> )

314
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:58,225
You have a talent
for<i> oo-mox.</i>

315
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,102
So I've been told.

316
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:05,149
I'll not be distracted
by your feminine wiles.

317
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,110
I demand 40%.

318
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:12,156
All right, 30...

319
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,993
What magnificent cartilage.

320
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,578
22, and don't stop.

321
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,747
You've got a deal.

322
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,295
I expect you'll make
all the necessary arrangements?

323
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:29,089
Oh, you're good.

324
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:33,260
You're very, very good.

325
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:45,565
(<i> sighs</i> )
How perfectly vile.

326
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,692
If that's the sort of company
you kept before meeting me,

327
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,318
it's no wonder
you ended up with Picard.

328
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,361
Go away.

329
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,196
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Enter.

330
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,741
Aren't we the hub
of activity?
(<i> Q disappears</i> )

331
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,993
I'm sorry, am I
interrupting anything?

332
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,285
No, come in, doctor.

333
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,955
Thank you, and please
call me Julian.

334
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,416
Julian, is this
medical business?

335
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,084
Well, to tell the truth,
I tried to come up

336
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,836
with some official reason
for dropping by,

337
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:08,004
but your excellent health

338
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,006
has robbed me
of any excuses.

339
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:11,591
Well, that didn't seem
to stop you.

340
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,134
So, I thought I'd contribute
to your good health

341
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,428
by buying you dinner.

342
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,221
Quark's makes
a delicious couscous,

343
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,934
and the company, I hope,
might be mildly entertaining.

344
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,352
Sounds like fun.

345
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:28,066
Uh, though, I would like
to, uh, freshen up first.

346
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,318
Could I meet you there
in, say, 20 minutes or so?

347
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,406
Those 20 minutes
will seem like an eternity.

348
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:43,247
These mating rituals
you humans indulge in

349
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,083
are really quite disgusting.
Get out.

350
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,918
You know you don't mean it.
Out!

351
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,294
You're making
a terrible mistake.

352
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,712
You'll be lost
without me.

353
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,171
I can take care
of myself.

354
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,926
Really? Well, we'll
see about that.

355
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,263
(<i> sighs</i> )

356
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,563
Oh, just a cup of mint tea,
please.

357
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:11,025
(<i> tsking</i> ) You're making
a terrible mistake.

358
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:15,321
Why? The replicators
haven't malfunctioned again?

359
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,115
I'm talking about Vash.

360
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,449
Stay away from her.

361
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,952
My God, you're
an impertinent waiter.

362
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:23,037
I'm a friend.
I'm giving you friendly advice.

363
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,288
She's nothing but trouble.

364
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,000
Really? Well, I don't see

365
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,668
that it's any of your
business who I see.

366
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,252
In fact, I'm having
dinner with her now.

367
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,546
Are you sure you're up to it?
You look tired.

368
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,173
I feel fine.

369
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,510
No, no, no, you look
very, very, tired.

370
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,930
(<i> yawning</i> )

371
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,144
Oh, God.

372
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,104
Funny, I...

373
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,815
I do feel a bit...
a bit spent.

374
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,399
Maybe I should...

375
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:56,236
Maybe I should go lie down
for a, for a minute.

376
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:00,491
Hopefully, by yourself
for a change.

377
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:03,744
Bloody hell.

378
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:08,290
Sir, the Klingon scout ship
has departed Docking Bay 11.

379
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:11,502
Good. I'll tell Odo
he can relax now.

380
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,505
We've got a problem, sir.

381
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,340
I just saw Q
on the Promenade.

382
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,300
Q here?
What's Q?

383
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,054
A powerful and extremely
unpredictable entity.

384
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:24,640
I was at a Starfleet briefing
on him two years ago.

385
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,726
Blasted menace
is what he is.

386
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,310
DAX:
What does he want with us?

387
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,646
Whatever it is, you can
be sure we won't like it.

388
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:31,939
You might ask Vash.

389
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,149
Why Vash?

390
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:34,525
They know each other.

391
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,360
From the<i> Enterprise?</i>

392
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,946
I believe they actually met
in Sherwood Forest.

393
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,823
It was one of
the little jokes

394
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,283
Q played on
the<i> Enterprise</i> crew.

395
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,373
Main power grid
has dropped 80%.

396
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,001
Sensors are reading
a massive graviton build-up.

397
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:54,712
How long will it take
to bring us back up
to full power?

398
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,881
It's already beginning
to normalize.

399
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,008
You know, if we have
one of these outages

400
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,300
during a docking procedure,

401
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,011
we could lose
an entire pylon.

402
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:03,846
I've double-checked
every system.

403
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,223
For the first time in a month

404
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,100
there's nothing wrong
with any of them.

405
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:11,104
It's got to be Q--
another one of his stupid jokes.

406
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,898
I'm not laughing.

407
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,776
I figured we'd
auction this off last.

408
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:20,320
Interesting, but hardly
of any intrinsic value.

409
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,615
Really? I thought it was the
best piece in the collection.

410
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,200
Oh, obviously,
my associates have

411
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:26,994
more sophisticated tastes
than what you're used to,

412
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:30,623
but, uh, just so it's
not a total loss,

413
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,416
I'll take it off
your hands for, say,

414
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,168
seven bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

415
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,962
It's worth 50 times as much.

416
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,588
(<i> laughing</i> ):
Ridiculous.

417
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,675
All right, 18,

418
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,427
but you must swear
never to tell a soul

419
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,721
about my foolish
generosity.

420
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:47,347
If you want it, you're
going to have to be

421
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,142
a lot more foolish
than that.

422
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,727
All right, 30.
Now, give it to me.

423
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:55,606
Bidding starts at 200
bars of gold latinum.

424
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,692
I can't decide
what's more intoxicating--

425
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:02,280
this Gamzian wine,
or your negotiating skills.

426
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,031
We need to talk.

427
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:07,910
The lady and I are having
a private conversation.

428
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,620
It can wait.

429
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:19,379
Tell me, Commander, where
is that doctor of yours?

430
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,175
He was supposed to meet me here
a half an hour ago.

431
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,843
Tell me about Q.

432
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,845
I'll tell you anything you
want to know, Commander.

433
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,847
(<i> whistles</i> )

434
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,807
Just answer one question--

435
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,349
is Starfleet penalizing you

436
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:34,687
or did you actually request
such a dismal command?

437
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,279
I want you off this station.

438
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:45,865
Don't be hasty,
my happy-go-lucky friend.

439
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,741
This dreary little gulag

440
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,910
could use a little
color, some excitement.

441
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:52,997
And who better
to provide that than<i> moi?</i>

442
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,210
Although, I must admit,
I like your new tailor.

443
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:59,586
I'm not impressed
by your parlor tricks.

444
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,215
These power outages
are going to stop, right now.

445
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:03,423
Why tell me?

446
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:06,052
Oh... oh, yes,
of course, go ahead,

447
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,221
blame Q if it makes
you feel any better.

448
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:09,763
I suppose it's my fate

449
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,307
to be the galaxy's
whipping boy.

450
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:14,185
Oh, heavy is the burden
of being me.

451
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:17,021
If you're looking for sympathy,
you've come to the wrong place.

452
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:20,774
Actually, what I was hoping
for was a little witty repartee

453
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,069
but I can see I'm not going
to get any of that either.

454
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,987
At least your beloved Jean-Luc

455
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,864
knew how to turn
a phrase.

456
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,867
Take a hint, Q.
No one wants you around.

457
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,953
Really, Vash, this playing
hard to get is growing tedious.

458
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:36,623
Let's not forget that I'm the Q,
and you the lowly human.

459
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,459
I'll decide when
this partnership is over.

460
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,711
Understand?

461
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:41,962
Why don't you and I

462
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,215
continue this discussion
in private?

463
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:46,008
Excellent idea.

464
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,218
You're right.

465
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,345
This<i> is</i> an excellent idea.

466
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:51,055
Sisko to Ops.

467
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:53,515
All gone.

468
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,435
Bring them back, Q.
<i>Now!</i>

469
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,604
Or what?

470
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,855
You'll thrash me?

471
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:02,440
Shall we settle
this<i> mano a mano?</i>

472
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,986
Marquis
of Queensberry rules?

473
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:07,238
What?

474
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,447
Fisticuffs, pugilism,

475
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,617
the manly art
of self-defense.

476
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,619
Come on.

477
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,996
Isn't this all
wonderfully barbaric?

478
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,664
Go on, take a poke at me.

479
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,833
I know that's what you really
want to do, come on.

480
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:23,129
I'll wager five bars
of latinum on Sisko.
You're on.

481
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,924
Fight back.
This is supposed to be brutal.

482
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:37,851
You can pay me
out of your profits

483
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,603
from the auction.

484
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,189
You hit me.

485
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,066
Picard never hit me.

486
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,110
I'm not Picard.

487
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:47,653
Indeed not.

488
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:50,197
You're much easier to provoke.

489
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,325
How fortunate for me.

490
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:23,481
Oh! Not again.

491
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:29,236
Damn it, Q.
Enough is enough.

492
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,113
We're losing atmosphere.

493
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:33,240
Decompression protocol.

494
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:36,494
Mr. O'Brien, raise
the confinement shields.

495
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,539
Shields up.

496
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:42,749
Damage report.

497
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,626
We've got a minor hull breach

498
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,544
in one of the upper bulkheads.

499
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,047
I'm getting reports
of hull fractures

500
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,798
throughout the station.

501
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,591
Emergency systems

502
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,843
appear to be
functioning.

503
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,054
Repair crews
are responding.

504
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,559
The breach was caused

505
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:04,230
by some kind of focused
graviton pulse.

506
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,482
Every time we've had
a power drain,

507
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:09,902
it's been followed
by an increase
in the graviton field.

508
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,278
If this continues,
we could wind up

509
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,280
with a breach in one
of our reactor cores.

510
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:14,823
We'd lose half the station.

511
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:16,116
Maybe it's time

512
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:18,077
we opened
negotiations with Q.

513
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,620
I'm not convinced Q
is behind this.

514
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,622
Playing with the lights and
punching holes in the hull

515
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:25,583
doesn't strike me
as his style.

516
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,047
You wanted to see me?

517
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,674
Make it quick.
I have important business.

518
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,009
Yes, I know.

519
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:36,720
You're auctioning off
some artifacts

520
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:39,597
from the Gamma Quadrant.

521
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:44,353
You were eavesdropping
on my conversation with Vash.

522
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:46,439
(<i> snickers</i> )

523
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,400
What were you this time?

524
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:53,653
The table?
One of the chairs?

525
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,240
The wine bottle.

526
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:58,825
When are you going to realize

527
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,370
that you have
no secrets from me?

528
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:02,871
I have nothing to hide.

529
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:05,249
I'm selling quality merchandise
to select clientele.

530
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:08,461
And what makes
them so select?

531
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:11,880
They're all
ridiculously wealthy...

532
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:15,134
and not too bright.

533
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,511
I'll never understand
this obsession

534
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,721
with accumulating
material wealth.

535
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,724
You spend your entire life
plotting and scheming

536
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,768
to acquire more
and more possessions

537
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,104
until your living
areas are bursting

538
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:30,316
with useless junk.
Then you die.

539
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,817
Your relatives sell everything

540
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:34,278
and start the cycle
all over again.

541
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:44,163
Isn't there anything
you...<i> desire?</i>

542
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,415
I have my work.

543
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:47,874
What more do I need?

544
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:52,129
A suit of the finest
Andorian silk?

545
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:55,633
A ring
of pure Surax?

546
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:57,301
A complete set

547
00:27:57,343 --> 00:28:00,471
of Tanesh pottery?

548
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:01,888
How about

549
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:06,018
a latinum-plated
bucket to sleep in?

550
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,314
Ah.

551
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:12,274
Ahh...

552
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,158
Well, I'm glad to see
you've packed.

553
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,619
I hope you said goodbye
to all your newfound friends.

554
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:25,245
I don't have
time for this.

555
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,789
You've led a charmed life
these past two years

556
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,543
under my benevolent
protection.

557
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,336
I can take care of myself.

558
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,880
Really?

559
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,508
Do you remember
that tiny little insect bite

560
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:40,719
you had
on Erabus Prime?

561
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,180
If I hadn't been there...

562
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:51,522
I am not going with you.

563
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:53,691
The galaxy
can be a dangerous place

564
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,484
when you're on your own.

565
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:03,116
It's over, Q.

566
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,954
(<i> groaning</i> )

567
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:17,089
I leave you now to reconsider
my offer of friendship.

568
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,860
SISKO:
<i>Station Log, Stardate 46531.2.</i>

569
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,071
<i>The station's power is</i>
<i>continuing to be drained</i>

570
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,115
<i>and converted into gravitons.</i>

571
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:46,952
<i>At this rate, our life-support</i>
<i>systems will fail in 14 hours.</i>

572
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:49,955
Sir, we'll never find
the source of the power drain

573
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:52,374
using these bloody Cardassian
internal sensors.

574
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,209
They're just
not sensitive enough.

575
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:56,712
What if we make the power drain
easier to detect.

576
00:29:56,754 --> 00:29:59,590
If we flood the station
with ionized tritium gas,

577
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:01,634
we should be able to trace
the particle flow

578
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:02,884
to the source.

579
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,136
Tritium?

580
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,554
Isn't that pretty toxic?

581
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:07,431
Only when it's highly
concentrated.

582
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,600
We'd only use
a very small amount.

583
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,184
Do it.

584
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,853
Unless we get this under control
in the next eight hours,

585
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,482
we'll begin
evacuation procedures.

586
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,234
Still chasing your own tail?
Picard and his lackeys

587
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:21,320
would have solved all this
technobabble hours ago.

588
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,782
No wonder you're not
commanding a starship.

589
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,241
Security to Ops.

590
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:29,411
Well, aren't we the feisty
little go-getter.

591
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:31,789
I'd keep my eye
on this one.

592
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,873
Chances are
she's after your job.

593
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,794
Why don't you do something
constructive for a change--

594
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,754
like torment
Cardassians.

595
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:40,673
Do I know you?

596
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:43,717
O'Brien.
From the<i> Enterprise.</i>

597
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,177
<i>Enterprise?</i>

598
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,512
Oh, yes.

599
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,264
Weren't you one
of the little people?

600
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,935
Quite a motley crew
you've assembled here, Benji.

601
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:57,272
My advice to you
is to evacuate now

602
00:30:57,314 --> 00:31:00,108
and save all this
pointless guesswork.

603
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,110
Q, either you tell us
what's going on

604
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:03,529
or get the hell
out of the way.

605
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,280
I'll tell you
what's going on.

606
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:07,533
While you're here conducting
futile experiments,

607
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,661
Vash is below engaged
in base commerce

608
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:14,289
and setting
Federation ethics
back 200 years.

609
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:16,625
Believe me, gang,

610
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:20,546
she's far more dangerous to you
than I.

611
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,143
Kolos, my friend.

612
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,645
I don't know
which pleases me more--

613
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:40,440
your smiling face
or your overflowing purse.

614
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,317
Quark, you obsequious toad.

615
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,610
Your so-called

616
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:45,654
Gamma Quadrant
merchandise

617
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:47,072
had better be legitimate

618
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,408
or I'll toss you out
the nearest airlock.

619
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,243
No cause for alarm.

620
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,994
Each piece comes complete

621
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:56,707
with a statement of authenticity
from Vash--

622
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:58,375
the Federation's
foremost expert

623
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,293
on the Gamma Quadrant.

624
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:04,798
In that case, stop sniveling
and give me a synthale.

625
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,598
Are they all
that pleasant?

626
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,101
I don't care
about their manners.

627
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,437
The important thing is

628
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:22,524
they're honest collectors
of antiquities-- every one.

629
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,025
How honest?

630
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,069
As honest as you and I.

631
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:29,489
Well, then, we'd better keep
a close eye on them.

632
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:33,410
My dear, I've been thinking.

633
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:37,831
What would you say to
a permanent partnership?

634
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:40,918
What with your knowledge
of the Gamma Quadrant

635
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:45,505
and<i> my</i> business connections,
we could make a fortune.

636
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:48,717
Sorry, Quark, but I've slept
in my last tent.

637
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:52,220
I'm looking forward to a nice,
quiet life back on Earth.

638
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:54,556
You won't last
a month.

639
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:56,266
You're like me.

640
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,059
You live for excitement,
adventure and profit.

641
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,978
Not anymore.

642
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:03,106
Would you care to make
a wager on that?

643
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,195
The graviton field
has increased by 60%.

644
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,657
How soon can we begin
the sensor sweep?

645
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,325
Not until we've increased
tritium levels

646
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,201
to one part per million.

647
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,329
Should only be another
seven, eight minutes.

648
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,624
Commander, we're being pulled
out of our normal position.

649
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,584
Use control thrusters
to stabilize the station.

650
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:25,128
Firing thrusters.

651
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,303
We're still moving.

652
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,763
O'BRIEN:
If the graviton field

653
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:36,598
is feeding off
the station's power

654
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,225
maybe we can cut its supply
by shutting down the reactors.

655
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,186
Put life support
on emergency backup.

656
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,938
Take everything else off line.

657
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,945
We're still moving
out of position.

658
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:52,071
What's our heading?

659
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:56,618
Bearing 157 mark 13.

660
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,829
Straight into the wormhole.

661
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:16,847
Now, as you know,

662
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:20,433
payment must be
in gold-pressed latinum

663
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:24,479
and all transactions
are final. Hmm?

664
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,276
Remember, bid high,
and bid often.

665
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,405
Ladies and gentlemen,

666
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,114
our first item
is a statue

667
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,826
from the Gamma Quadrant's
Verath system.

668
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:40,495
Now, I suppose
I should take a minute

669
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:43,289
to tell you a little bit
about the Verathan civilization,

670
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:47,377
which reached its height
some 30,000 years ago

671
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,713
and spanned
over two dozen systems

672
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:51,715
interconnected
by a highly developed trade

673
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,508
and communications network.

674
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,844
This statue
represents Drohlak--

675
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:57,804
the Prime Ossemite
of the 19th dynasty.

676
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,347
Vash, what are
you doing?

677
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:02,308
I'm placing the statue
in its historical context.

678
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,769
Give me that.

679
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,187
This isn't the
Daystrom Institute.

680
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,940
Watch closely.

681
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,569
Friends...

682
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,529
it's rare...

683
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:16,281
it's beautiful...

684
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:19,492
and it's
a Gamma Quadrant original!

685
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,703
And it can be yours
for the right price.

686
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:26,583
Bidding will start at ten bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

687
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,167
Make it ten.

688
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,462
Fifteen?

689
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,380
Sixteen?

690
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:34,007
Who will say 17

691
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:37,135
and be the first to own a piece
of the Gamma Quadrant?

692
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,220
O'BRIEN:
Tritium levels
throughout the station

693
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,848
have reached one part
per million.

694
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,101
Initiating sensor sweep.

695
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:49,648
We can rule out
the docking ring.

696
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,317
The tritium gas
seems to be draining towards

697
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,820
the central core.
Where in the central core?

698
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:58,031
O'BRIEN:
Let me see if I can get
a more precise reading.

699
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:02,077
It's not clear enough.

700
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:04,621
I can't pinpoint
an exact location.

701
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:07,082
Based on our
current trajectory...

702
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,543
we'll hit the wormhole
in 18 minutes.

703
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,253
SISKO:
What the hell

704
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,714
could be pulling us
into the wormhole?

705
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,093
Do we have time
to transfer auxiliary power

706
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:19,302
to the deflectors, Chief?

707
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:20,762
Sir, there's not
enough power left

708
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,139
to make any difference.

709
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,515
If we get sucked
into that wormhole,

710
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:24,933
we'll be in a billion pieces

711
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:26,852
by the time we reach
the Gamma Quadrant.

712
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:35,276
Sold to Kolos for 36 bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

713
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,239
Next, we have...

714
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,410
a dagger...

715
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:48,123
studded with some
very interesting-looking gems.

716
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:50,375
Think of it

717
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:53,461
as a weapon
and an investment.

718
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:55,881
Bidding will start at 40.

719
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,632
Forty.

720
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:00,218
Forty-two?

721
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,678
Forty-two.

722
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,013
Forty-five?

723
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:05,140
Don't hold back.

724
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:06,683
You know you want it.

725
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,226
Give me 50.

726
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,269
50. We have 50.

727
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,480
I hate to interrupt

728
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:14,858
such a thrilling display
of naked avarice,

729
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,069
but I thought
it was only right of me

730
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,238
to warn you that this station
is hurtling towards its doom,

731
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,574
and it's very unlikely

732
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:25,451
that any of you will survive
to enjoy your purchases.

733
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,413
I just thought I'd mention it.
Please, carry on.

734
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,582
Ladies and gentlemen,
I assure you,

735
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,458
everything is under control.

736
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,793
Drinks for everyone,

737
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,337
and free use
of the holosuites

738
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,839
at the conclusion
of the auction, eh?

739
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:40,383
I don't think I realized
until this moment

740
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,260
how evil you really are.

741
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,054
You would kill
all these people

742
00:37:44,096 --> 00:37:45,597
to get even with me.

743
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:48,016
Well, I must admit,
the thought had occurred to me,

744
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:50,810
but this station is
in enough trouble without me,

745
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:53,146
although I'd be glad
to save you.

746
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,564
All you have to do is ask.

747
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:57,234
I'll take my chances
with the others.

748
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,651
As you choose.

749
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:03,156
I'm going to just sit
right here and watch.

750
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:06,910
I've never seen a space station
torn apart by a wormhole before.

751
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:08,327
QUARK:
100!

752
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,622
Sold to my cousin Stol

753
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,374
for 105 bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

754
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:16,086
What if we pumped
more tritium gas
into the central core?

755
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:17,629
The sensors might
be more accurate

756
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,257
with a greater
concentration.
It might work,

757
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,758
but in four years,
we'd all be dead

758
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,593
from tritium poisoning.

759
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,845
Wait a minute.
Of course.

760
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:27,430
Bring the reactors
back on line.

761
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,975
The reactors?
But they'll just
feed more energy

762
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,226
into the graviton field.

763
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:33,228
If we generate enough energy,

764
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,521
it should create a power drain
big enough to trace.

765
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,857
It might also push us faster
into the wormhole.

766
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:39,358
A lot faster.

767
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,861
It's a chance
we've got to take.

768
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,863
Bring us to full
power, Mr. O'Brien.

769
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,198
Everything you've got.

770
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,408
Aye, sir.

771
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:51,454
Sold to Rul the Obscure

772
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:55,374
for 151 latinum bars.

773
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,961
And now...

774
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:04,176
our final item,

775
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:07,846
and I think you'll
agree with me

776
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:11,183
it was well worth the wait.

777
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:17,522
Bidding will start

778
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:22,652
at 200 bars of
gold-pressed latinum.

779
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,071
Two hundred?

780
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:29,951
Can I get 250?
250. 300, anyone?

781
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:33,621
Three hundred bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

782
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:34,998
Three hundred-fifty?

783
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,042
Here.
Four hundred?

784
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,793
Four hundred.

785
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:40,170
Five?
Five!

786
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:42,130
Five hundred and twenty?

787
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:48,427
Six hundred bars of
gold- pressed latinum.

788
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,348
DAX:
It's not in any
of the crossover bridges

789
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,391
or in the habitat ring.

790
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:54,767
It's in the upper core.

791
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:58,271
Three minutes,
14 seconds to the wormhole.

792
00:39:58,313 --> 00:39:59,856
We're picking up speed.

793
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,274
I've got it.

794
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,318
The power drain's coming
from the Promenade.

795
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,944
Chief, you have Ops.

796
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,367
2,500.

797
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:16,289
2,500, and one.

798
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:26,007
This way.

799
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,225
3,000 bars of latinum.

800
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:36,434
My final offer.

801
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,186
3,000 bars!

802
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:40,563
A million.

803
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,567
A million bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

804
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,153
Over here.
A million
going once...

805
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,529
It's by the podium.

806
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,115
A million
going twice...
That's it.

807
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,324
Three times.

808
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:53,243
This auction's over.
Sold.

809
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:55,828
Chief, shut down the reactors.
We've found it.

810
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,872
And it's about time, too.

811
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:59,624
Sorry, all transactions
are final.

812
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,543
This item belongs
to that gentleman over there.

813
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:05,463
I'm reading a massive graviton
buildup inside this container.

814
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,506
It's increasing
exponentially.

815
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,259
We have to get it
off the station now.

816
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:11,928
Chief, lock onto my combadge.

817
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,680
Prepare to transport it
500 meters off the docking ring.

818
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,141
But I haven't been paid.

819
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,475
Energize.

820
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:53,136
SISKO:
<i>Station Log, Stardate 46532.3.</i>

821
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:55,638
<i>With the embryonic life-form</i>
<i>off the station,</i>

822
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,432
<i>graviton levels</i>
<i>have returned to normal.</i>

823
00:41:57,474 --> 00:41:59,225
<i>We've used</i>
<i>the control thrusters</i>

824
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,978
<i>to return the station</i>
<i>to its original position.</i>

825
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:06,232
So... you're off to
the Daystrom Institute.

826
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:07,775
Bet you can hardly wait.

827
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:11,737
Long, boring lectures,
endless conferences,

828
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:16,409
whining students
dogging your every step.

829
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:18,244
Sounds delightful.

830
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,246
Of course...

831
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,749
No, you wouldn't
be interested.

832
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,793
In what?

833
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:31,674
I hear they've
uncovered the ruins

834
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:35,178
of a Rokai provincial
capital on Tartaras V.

835
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:39,598
If you could obtain
some Rokain artifacts...

836
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,143
Forget it, Quark.

837
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:43,686
I'm going back to Earth.

838
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:45,313
Have it your way.

839
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:47,190
Q:
An abysmal place.

840
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:50,151
Tartaras V?

841
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:52,529
Earth.
Oh, don't get me wrong.

842
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,739
A thousand years ago,
it had character.

843
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:59,035
Crusades, Spanish Inquisition,
Watergate.

844
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:01,913
Now it's just
mind-numbingly dull.

845
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:05,542
Well, then, by all means,
don't come with me.

846
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,627
I think you'd
be much happier

847
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:12,006
poking about the ruins
of Tartaras V.

848
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:14,633
I don't need
your advice.

849
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,762
You really think I...?

850
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,558
You know, I still feel
that I owe you

851
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,894
a million bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

852
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:28,314
Keep it-- just give
me back my life.

853
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:29,648
You'll regret it if I do.

854
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,277
I'm willing to
take my chances.

855
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:35,196
All right, if you insist.

856
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:37,574
But it's not going
to be the same without you.

857
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:41,453
When I look at a gas nebula,
all I see is a cloud of dust.

858
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:43,455
Seeing the universe
through your eyes,

859
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:48,460
I was able to experience...
wonder.

860
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:50,628
I'm going to miss that.

861
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,093
Well, I guess in some ways,
I'm going to miss you, too.

862
00:43:57,135 --> 00:44:00,513
Maybe I could
drop in sometime.

863
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:02,599
Oh, God, I hope not.

864
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:06,018
Hey, Quark.

865
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,354
What's the quickest way
to Tartaras V?

866
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:09,688
Ah...

867
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,705
I feel as though
I've been asleep for days.

868
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:29,167
What?

869
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:31,877
Did I miss something?
