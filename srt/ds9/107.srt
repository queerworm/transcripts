1
00:00:02,897 --> 00:00:04,730
So, there I was...

2
00:00:04,768 --> 00:00:07,831
fighting the toughest battle
of my life...

3
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:10,937
Iooking around,
hoping to spot a friendly face

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,177
only to discover
my colleagues...

5
00:00:13,218 --> 00:00:15,154
were gone.

6
00:00:15,188 --> 00:00:16,588
I was alone.

7
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:19,620
I admit for a moment there
I considered giving up.

8
00:00:19,665 --> 00:00:22,033
I could feel
the seconds ticking away...

9
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:23,902
panic building up
inside of me.

10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,809
I knew my only chance
was to trust my instincts

11
00:00:26,845 --> 00:00:28,576
so I closed my eyes...

12
00:00:28,616 --> 00:00:31,179
took a deep breath

13
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,090
and just like that,
it came to me...

14
00:00:34,126 --> 00:00:36,859
the answer I was looking for...

15
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,028
a pericardial membrane!

16
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,038
Oh!

17
00:00:40,072 --> 00:00:41,404
I looked down

18
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:44,208
and punched the answer
into my computer terminal

19
00:00:44,246 --> 00:00:46,877
just as the buzzer sounded,
ending the exam

20
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:48,410
and that, I suppose

21
00:00:48,455 --> 00:00:51,552
is the stuff
salutatorians are made of.

22
00:00:51,595 --> 00:00:53,258
Salutatorian?

23
00:00:53,365 --> 00:00:58,239
Well, I mistook
a preganglionic fiber

24
00:00:58,274 --> 00:01:01,508
for a postganglionic nerve
during the orals

25
00:01:01,547 --> 00:01:04,542
or I would have been
valedictorian.

26
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:06,217
It was a trick question.

27
00:01:06,324 --> 00:01:07,656
Fascinating.

28
00:01:07,694 --> 00:01:10,028
Not nearly as fascinating
as when I...

29
00:01:10,065 --> 00:01:12,194
Dr. Bashir, Chief O'Brien.

30
00:01:12,236 --> 00:01:15,697
Report to Landing Pad Five.

31
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:17,542
Bad timing.

32
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,812
There'll be another time.

33
00:01:26,364 --> 00:01:28,493
Starfleet medical finals.

34
00:01:28,535 --> 00:01:30,300
Gets them every time.

35
00:01:34,246 --> 00:01:35,271
It's no use.

36
00:01:35,382 --> 00:01:37,443
Chief!

37
00:01:37,486 --> 00:01:38,681
We have to get
this hatch open.

38
00:01:38,722 --> 00:01:40,954
Lieutenant Dax and Ensign Pauley
are trapped in there.

39
00:01:40,993 --> 00:01:42,154
The runabout
barely made it back

40
00:01:42,196 --> 00:01:43,289
through the wormhole.

41
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:44,593
By the time they docked

42
00:01:44,634 --> 00:01:45,863
power levels were near zero.

43
00:01:45,903 --> 00:01:47,429
There's not even enough juice
left in the ship

44
00:01:47,473 --> 00:01:48,441
to release the servos.

45
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:49,636
Life support's down.

46
00:01:49,678 --> 00:01:51,807
Oxygen levels have dropped
dangerously low.

47
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:52,908
Have to burn it through.

48
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:53,919
Forget it, Major.

49
00:01:53,953 --> 00:01:55,513
The hatch is made
of duranium composite.

50
00:01:55,555 --> 00:01:57,184
It'll take you an hour
to get through it.

51
00:01:57,226 --> 00:01:58,194
We don't have that much time.

52
00:01:58,228 --> 00:01:59,196
That's odd.

53
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,564
How many passengers did you say
were on board the <i>Ganges?</i>

54
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:02,569
Two.

55
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:03,571
I'm reading three.

56
00:02:03,605 --> 00:02:05,370
We need to get power
to the hatch servos.

57
00:02:05,408 --> 00:02:07,139
Major, hand me
the EPI capacitor.

58
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:09,081
There, middle shelf.

59
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:20,037
Try her now.

60
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:32,320
Dax?

61
00:02:32,362 --> 00:02:34,389
I'm fine. Check the others.

62
00:02:38,943 --> 00:02:39,933
Vash?

63
00:02:39,978 --> 00:02:41,641
That's right.

64
00:02:41,682 --> 00:02:44,882
Miles O'Brien,
from the <i>Enterprise.</i>

65
00:02:44,921 --> 00:02:46,686
Oh. Yes, of course.

66
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:48,820
What are you doing
on the <i>Ganges?</i>

67
00:02:48,862 --> 00:02:49,887
We found her

68
00:02:49,931 --> 00:02:51,194
in the Gamma Quadrant.

69
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:53,362
She'd been there
for over two years.

70
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:54,997
Two years?!

71
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,806
Doctor, we'd better
get these people

72
00:02:56,845 --> 00:02:58,006
over to the infirmary.

73
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:01,412
Right this way.

74
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:10,560
How did you get to the Gamma
Quadrant two years ago?

75
00:03:10,605 --> 00:03:12,336
A friend dropped me off.

76
00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:13,366
Oh.

77
00:05:20,322 --> 00:05:22,019
Will I live?

78
00:05:22,059 --> 00:05:23,688
You're fine.

79
00:05:23,728 --> 00:05:26,164
In fact...

80
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,193
you're in remarkable shape.

81
00:05:28,238 --> 00:05:29,867
Thank you, Doctor.

82
00:05:29,908 --> 00:05:31,308
I try.

83
00:05:31,344 --> 00:05:34,180
Well, l-I-I-I mean
you've, uh...

84
00:05:34,216 --> 00:05:35,479
managed quite well

85
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,352
considering you've
been out of contact

86
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:39,222
with civilization
for over two years.

87
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,232
Well, I'd hardly call
the Gamma Quadrant uncivilized.

88
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:44,065
Some of the cultures
I've encountered

89
00:05:44,103 --> 00:05:46,335
have histories dating back
millions of years.

90
00:05:46,374 --> 00:05:49,540
Really? I'd love
to hear about them.

91
00:05:49,647 --> 00:05:52,049
I mean, we have no idea
what's beyond the wormhole.

92
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,987
Well, maybe I'll write a book.

93
00:05:54,023 --> 00:05:57,393
Well, it's sure to be a
best-seller around here.

94
00:05:57,429 --> 00:05:59,422
I... well... um...

95
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:02,768
no sign of disease
or malnutrition

96
00:06:02,806 --> 00:06:04,742
or parasitic infections.

97
00:06:04,777 --> 00:06:07,077
You sound disappointed.

98
00:06:07,115 --> 00:06:08,982
I am.

99
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:11,855
Now I have no reason
to keep you here.

100
00:06:11,892 --> 00:06:16,230
Well, you almost make me wish
I wasn't feeling well.

101
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:28,155
And she claims she knew nothing
about the wormhole?

102
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:30,218
She did seem very surprised
when I told her about it.

103
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:31,729
I don't think she ever expected

104
00:06:31,764 --> 00:06:33,529
to see this part
of the galaxy again.

105
00:06:33,568 --> 00:06:35,197
How could she get there
in the first place

106
00:06:35,238 --> 00:06:36,729
if she didn't go
through the wormhole?

107
00:06:36,774 --> 00:06:39,837
She said she didn't
want to talk about it.

108
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,713
Said it was a personal matter.

109
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:43,083
This doesn't make sense...

110
00:06:43,121 --> 00:06:45,455
a human alone in the Gamma
Quadrant for two years.

111
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:46,824
Let's check her background.

112
00:06:46,861 --> 00:06:48,592
See what we can
find out about her.

113
00:06:48,631 --> 00:06:50,999
She claims to be
an archaeologist.

114
00:06:51,037 --> 00:06:53,132
That's a good place to start.

115
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,983
You sure this place is safe?

116
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:01,353
The Assay Office

117
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,055
is the most secure
area on the station.

118
00:07:04,096 --> 00:07:06,863
The chambers are
surrounded on all sides

119
00:07:06,901 --> 00:07:08,734
by individual force fields.

120
00:07:08,771 --> 00:07:10,866
And how are
the locks controlled?

121
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:13,847
Once you secure a chamber,
it can't be opened

122
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:16,785
except with your personal
authorization code

123
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:19,850
combined with a verified
retinal print.

124
00:07:19,893 --> 00:07:22,056
A Cardassian MK-7 scanner?

125
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:23,590
MK-12.

126
00:07:23,701 --> 00:07:26,537
With an L-90
enhanced resolution filter.

127
00:07:26,574 --> 00:07:30,241
Well, I suppose
that will have to do.

128
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:36,487
Computer, begin inventory
for cubicle 19.

129
00:07:37,863 --> 00:07:39,958
One statue...

130
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,630
stone.

131
00:07:41,704 --> 00:07:46,840
30-odd centimeters tall,
approximately eight kilograms.

132
00:07:49,253 --> 00:07:52,157
Assorted gems.

133
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,901
Gold necklace.

134
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,083
One dagger...

135
00:08:07,122 --> 00:08:09,024
bronze and gold.

136
00:08:09,059 --> 00:08:12,088
About 25 centimeters.

137
00:08:18,077 --> 00:08:19,511
Beautiful.

138
00:08:19,546 --> 00:08:22,541
I've never seen anything
quite like it.

139
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:25,956
Some kind of Promethean quartz.

140
00:08:25,992 --> 00:08:27,655
I thought so, too, at first

141
00:08:27,762 --> 00:08:30,666
but its molecular density
and refraction index

142
00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:31,668
is much higher.

143
00:08:31,737 --> 00:08:33,639
Remarkable.

144
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,983
End inventory.

145
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:45,890
Please, enter an access code.

146
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:02,658
All right.

147
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:05,330
I'll be back tomorrow
to pick everything up.

148
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:07,466
I've booked passage
on the Mulzirak Transport.

149
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:10,174
You're not leaving us
so soon, are you?

150
00:09:10,214 --> 00:09:11,774
I'm afraid so.

151
00:09:16,727 --> 00:09:19,426
The Daystrom Institute
will be very disappointed.

152
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:20,934
The Daystrom Institute?

153
00:09:20,969 --> 00:09:22,096
Their scientists
are anxious

154
00:09:22,138 --> 00:09:23,869
to hear about life
in the Gamma Quadrant.

155
00:09:23,908 --> 00:09:26,140
Every place you've been,
everything you've seen

156
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,671
no matter
how insignificant

157
00:09:27,716 --> 00:09:30,517
could prove to be important,
including how you got there.

158
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:32,889
Sorry, Commander,
but that's a...

159
00:09:32,926 --> 00:09:34,417
Personal matter.
...personal matter.

160
00:09:39,673 --> 00:09:42,440
So now the Daystrom
Institute is interested in me.

161
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:43,708
Well, that's ironic.

162
00:09:43,748 --> 00:09:45,980
Professor Woo
seemed especially eager

163
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,385
to speak to you again.

164
00:09:47,422 --> 00:09:48,390
Did he really?

165
00:09:48,424 --> 00:09:50,690
I suppose he told you
he suspended my membership

166
00:09:50,728 --> 00:09:52,857
from the Institute's
Archaeological Council?

167
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:53,867
On two occasions.

168
00:09:53,901 --> 00:09:56,030
Something about the sale
of illegal artifacts.

169
00:09:56,072 --> 00:09:57,632
Well, when it
comes to choosing

170
00:09:57,675 --> 00:09:59,007
between science and profit

171
00:09:59,045 --> 00:10:00,605
I'll choose profit every time.

172
00:10:00,648 --> 00:10:03,415
The professor was hoping you'd
make an exception in this case.

173
00:10:03,454 --> 00:10:06,585
You know, I haven't
been back to Earth in...

174
00:10:06,627 --> 00:10:08,027
it must be 12 years.

175
00:10:08,063 --> 00:10:09,361
Here's your chance.

176
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:11,266
I could arrange passage.

177
00:10:11,303 --> 00:10:14,366
I think I'd like that.

178
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:16,743
Fine. I'll take care of it.

179
00:10:27,535 --> 00:10:29,437
I don't understand it,
Commander.

180
00:10:29,473 --> 00:10:31,670
I can't find anything
wrong with her.

181
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,546
This ship is
completely functional.

182
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,212
It didn't look that way
this morning.

183
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:37,984
Oh, don't get me wrong.

184
00:10:38,022 --> 00:10:39,787
The power reserves are empty.

185
00:10:39,826 --> 00:10:42,423
The inertial damping fields
are barely operational

186
00:10:42,465 --> 00:10:44,128
and the warp drive
containment field's

187
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:45,535
on the verge of collapse.

188
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:46,630
But?

189
00:10:46,673 --> 00:10:48,870
But there's nothing
wrong with any of them.

190
00:10:48,911 --> 00:10:50,778
Once we put power back into her

191
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:52,808
she should be fully operational.

192
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,879
Did you check the central
power linkages?

193
00:10:54,956 --> 00:10:56,049
Yes, sir.

194
00:10:56,092 --> 00:10:57,789
I ran a level-1 diagnostic.

195
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:59,092
Everything checks out.

196
00:10:59,131 --> 00:11:00,599
I can't explain it.

197
00:11:00,635 --> 00:11:03,732
It's like something
tapped into the ship's systems

198
00:11:03,774 --> 00:11:05,368
and drained them dry.

199
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:14,292
Tell me, Chief, how well
do you know this woman Vash?

200
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:15,297
Hardly at all.

201
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:16,526
Only met her that one time

202
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:17,865
she was aboard the <i>Enterprise.</i>

203
00:11:17,902 --> 00:11:19,029
What was she doing there?

204
00:11:19,071 --> 00:11:22,407
Well, sir,
Vash and Captain Picard

205
00:11:22,445 --> 00:11:23,470
were friends...

206
00:11:23,514 --> 00:11:25,984
close friends,
if you follow my meaning.

207
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:29,252
Seems they met on Risa
a few years back.

208
00:11:29,292 --> 00:11:30,487
I figure she must be
a special woman

209
00:11:30,528 --> 00:11:32,498
being friends with
the Captain and all.

210
00:11:32,532 --> 00:11:34,468
Somehow, she doesn't seem
to be his type.

211
00:11:34,502 --> 00:11:38,670
Well, the Captain likes
a good challenge, sir.

212
00:11:47,428 --> 00:11:48,828
Status report?

213
00:11:48,864 --> 00:11:51,495
We suffered
a broad-spectrum power drain.

214
00:11:51,536 --> 00:11:53,403
Power transfer is
completely inoperative.

215
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,499
The energy was drawn out

216
00:11:54,542 --> 00:11:55,805
faster than it could handle.

217
00:11:55,845 --> 00:11:57,508
I'll have to replace
the whole unit.

218
00:11:57,548 --> 00:12:00,384
Chief, are you reading
any graviton flux

219
00:12:00,421 --> 00:12:02,516
around the transfer systems?

220
00:12:02,558 --> 00:12:04,790
I am detecting a low-level
graviton disturbance.

221
00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:05,652
How did you know?

222
00:12:05,785 --> 00:12:07,618
That's exactly what happened

223
00:12:07,656 --> 00:12:09,956
when we lost power
on the <i>Ganges.</i>

224
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:23,143
These were originally
Cardassian living quarters.

225
00:12:23,186 --> 00:12:25,486
The bed may take
some getting used to.

226
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:26,925
As an archaeologist

227
00:12:26,961 --> 00:12:29,261
I've spent half my life
sleeping in tents.

228
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:31,531
To me, any bed
will be a luxury.

229
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,233
You've obviously never slept

230
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:34,868
on a Cardassian mattress.

231
00:12:36,313 --> 00:12:38,476
If you need anything,
just ask the computer.

232
00:12:38,518 --> 00:12:39,816
Thanks, Chief.

233
00:12:39,853 --> 00:12:42,346
Oh, by the way, how's Jean-Luc?

234
00:12:42,392 --> 00:12:43,360
The Captain?

235
00:12:43,394 --> 00:12:44,362
Mm-hmm.

236
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:45,990
The last time I saw him,
he was fine.

237
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:49,368
Well, now that I'm back,
I'll have to look him up.

238
00:13:22,873 --> 00:13:24,706
Really, Vash, I can't believe

239
00:13:24,743 --> 00:13:26,940
you're still pining
for Jean-Luc...

240
00:13:26,981 --> 00:13:29,247
that self-righteous
do-gooder.

241
00:13:29,285 --> 00:13:31,848
I should have listened to him
when he warned me about you.

242
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:33,359
You're hurt, you strike back

243
00:13:33,394 --> 00:13:35,125
I understand,
but be of good cheer

244
00:13:35,163 --> 00:13:37,726
I bring you wonderful news...
I'm back.

245
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:38,896
And I can see now

246
00:13:38,938 --> 00:13:41,033
it was cruel of me to leave you.

247
00:13:41,075 --> 00:13:44,138
Very touching, but you
didn't leave me, I left you.

248
00:13:44,181 --> 00:13:46,515
You left me, I left you...
details, mere details.

249
00:13:46,553 --> 00:13:47,612
The important thing is

250
00:13:47,656 --> 00:13:49,353
we're back together again...
a team.

251
00:13:49,393 --> 00:13:51,420
Joined together at the hip.

252
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:52,658
Not a chance.

253
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:54,998
You know
you're going to miss me.

254
00:13:55,037 --> 00:13:57,234
Don't flatter yourself.

255
00:13:58,878 --> 00:13:59,868
You know, I thought

256
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:01,610
we'd first visit
the Teleris Cluster

257
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:04,017
look in on the star
dancers at Mundahla

258
00:14:04,055 --> 00:14:06,025
or maybe head over
to the Lantar Nebula

259
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:08,529
and view the Sampalo
relic on Hoek IV.

260
00:14:08,564 --> 00:14:09,862
Not interested.

261
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,965
I know... Vadris III,
charming little world.

262
00:14:14,008 --> 00:14:15,237
The natives think they're

263
00:14:15,277 --> 00:14:17,372
the only intelligent
life in the universe.

264
00:14:17,415 --> 00:14:18,576
No!

265
00:14:22,859 --> 00:14:24,488
All right.

266
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:25,792
You choose then.

267
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:28,395
I choose never to go anywhere
with you again, Q.

268
00:14:28,437 --> 00:14:29,427
You don't know

269
00:14:29,473 --> 00:14:30,566
what you're missing.

270
00:14:30,608 --> 00:14:32,237
When we started this little
partnership

271
00:14:32,277 --> 00:14:34,805
I promised to take you places
no human had ever seen before.

272
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,250
And you have.

273
00:14:36,285 --> 00:14:38,084
It was wonderful.

274
00:14:38,123 --> 00:14:39,683
Thank you.

275
00:14:39,793 --> 00:14:41,261
Now, good-bye.

276
00:14:41,295 --> 00:14:44,267
Two years in the Gamma
Quadrant hardly qualifies

277
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,271
as a grand tour
of the universe.

278
00:14:46,305 --> 00:14:48,936
There's still the Delta
Quadrant to explore

279
00:14:48,978 --> 00:14:51,278
not to mention all
the other galaxies.

280
00:14:51,315 --> 00:14:52,442
It's over, Q.

281
00:14:52,485 --> 00:14:53,953
I want you out of my life.

282
00:14:53,988 --> 00:14:55,548
You are arrogant,
you're overbearing

283
00:14:55,591 --> 00:14:57,322
and you think
you know everything.

284
00:14:57,361 --> 00:14:59,729
But I do know everything.

285
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,634
That makes it even worse.

286
00:15:02,672 --> 00:15:04,072
All right, fine.

287
00:15:04,108 --> 00:15:05,542
What is it you really want?

288
00:15:05,578 --> 00:15:08,345
I want the life I had
before I met you.

289
00:15:08,383 --> 00:15:12,323
And a stellar life, indeed.

290
00:15:12,357 --> 00:15:14,486
The eminent Vash...

291
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:18,230
barred from the Royal Museum
of Epsilon Hydra VII.

292
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:20,262
Persona non grata
on Betazed.

293
00:15:20,307 --> 00:15:21,936
Wanted dead on Myrmidon

294
00:15:21,977 --> 00:15:24,574
for stealing the Crown
of the First Mother.

295
00:15:24,616 --> 00:15:26,449
Dead or alive.

296
00:15:26,487 --> 00:15:28,889
Preferably dead.

297
00:15:28,924 --> 00:15:30,826
It's a wonder
you haven't offended

298
00:15:30,862 --> 00:15:32,456
every sentient race
in the galaxy.

299
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:35,471
You're the one who almost got me
killed on Erriakang VII.

300
00:15:35,505 --> 00:15:36,734
And they weren't
exactly thrilled

301
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,865
to see you on Brax either.

302
00:15:37,909 --> 00:15:39,606
What did they call you,
"the God of lies"?

303
00:15:39,646 --> 00:15:41,250
They meant it affectionately.

304
00:15:41,249 --> 00:15:41,578
They meant it affectionately.

305
00:15:42,585 --> 00:15:43,848
Come in.

306
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:45,983
I...

307
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:47,357
Go away.

308
00:15:48,363 --> 00:15:49,490
Q, bring him back.

309
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,503
What business could
you possibly have

310
00:15:51,537 --> 00:15:53,404
with that disgusting
little troll?

311
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:54,498
I don't know.

312
00:15:54,543 --> 00:15:56,604
You didn't give him
time to tell me.

313
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:58,617
Now, bring him back
this instant.

314
00:15:58,651 --> 00:15:59,880
All right.

315
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,427
Can I help you?

316
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:08,637
My name is Quark.

317
00:16:08,671 --> 00:16:11,472
It's, uh, it's come
to my attention

318
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:15,644
that you have access
to certain... items.

319
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:19,887
Items that might perhaps
turn a tidy profit?

320
00:16:20,928 --> 00:16:22,989
I'm listening.

321
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:24,763
For a percentage

322
00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:30,677
I might be able to arrange
a buyer for your trinkets

323
00:16:30,715 --> 00:16:32,708
perhaps an auction.

324
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:37,682
I'll only accept payment
in gold-pressed latinum.

325
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:41,362
I'll shower you in it... 50-50.

326
00:16:41,402 --> 00:16:42,700
Mr. Quark, I believe

327
00:16:42,739 --> 00:16:46,075
you're trying to take
advantage of me.

328
00:16:48,584 --> 00:16:50,052
Some wine?

329
00:16:50,086 --> 00:16:52,579
Oh, oh...

330
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,329
You have a talent
for <i>oo-mox.</i>

331
00:16:57,367 --> 00:16:59,360
So I've been told.

332
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:04,177
I'll not be distracted
by your feminine wiles.

333
00:17:04,214 --> 00:17:06,879
I demand 40%.

334
00:17:08,557 --> 00:17:11,188
All right, 30...

335
00:17:11,228 --> 00:17:13,698
What magnificent cartilage.

336
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:16,365
22, and don't stop.

337
00:17:16,405 --> 00:17:18,398
You've got a deal.

338
00:17:21,883 --> 00:17:25,322
I expect you'll make
all the necessary arrangements?

339
00:17:25,357 --> 00:17:28,727
Oh, you're good.

340
00:17:28,764 --> 00:17:32,431
You're very, very good.

341
00:17:42,825 --> 00:17:44,316
How perfectly vile.

342
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:46,524
If that's the sort of company
you kept before meeting me

343
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,091
it's no wonder
you ended up with Picard.

344
00:17:48,136 --> 00:17:49,126
Go away.

345
00:17:50,306 --> 00:17:51,399
Enter.

346
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:52,968
Aren't we the hub
of activity?

347
00:17:53,981 --> 00:17:55,678
I'm sorry, am I
interrupting anything?

348
00:17:55,718 --> 00:17:57,209
No, come in, Doctor.

349
00:17:57,254 --> 00:17:59,885
Thank you, and please
call me Julian.

350
00:17:59,926 --> 00:18:02,489
Julian, is this
medical business?

351
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:04,125
Well, to tell the truth,
I tried to come up

352
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:06,001
with some official reason
for dropping by

353
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:07,165
but your excellent health

354
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:08,836
has robbed me
of any excuses.

355
00:18:08,944 --> 00:18:10,777
Well, that didn't seem
to stop you.

356
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,582
So, I thought I'd contribute
to your good health

357
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,747
by buying you dinner.

358
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:16,759
Quark's makes
a delicious couscous

359
00:18:16,793 --> 00:18:19,993
and the company, I hope,
might be mildly entertaining.

360
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:22,367
Sounds like fun.

361
00:18:22,404 --> 00:18:27,108
Uh, though, I would like
to, uh, freshen up first.

362
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:30,381
Could I meet you there
in, say, 20 minutes or so?

363
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,155
Those 20 minutes
will seem like an eternity.

364
00:18:40,073 --> 00:18:42,305
These mating rituals
you humans indulge in

365
00:18:42,344 --> 00:18:43,471
are really quite disgusting.

366
00:18:43,513 --> 00:18:44,481
Get out.

367
00:18:44,515 --> 00:18:45,483
You know you don't mean it.

368
00:18:45,517 --> 00:18:46,644
Out!

369
00:18:46,686 --> 00:18:47,813
You're making
a terrible mistake.

370
00:18:47,855 --> 00:18:48,823
You'll be lost without me.

371
00:18:48,857 --> 00:18:50,827
I can take care of myself.

372
00:18:50,861 --> 00:18:53,594
Really? Well,
we'll see about that.

373
00:19:04,635 --> 00:19:06,662
Oh, just a cup of mint tea,
please.

374
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:10,041
You're making
a terrible mistake.

375
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,316
Why? The replicators
haven't malfunctioned again?

376
00:19:14,355 --> 00:19:16,120
I'm talking about Vash.

377
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:17,491
Stay away from her.

378
00:19:17,528 --> 00:19:20,091
My God, you're
an impertinent waiter.

379
00:19:20,133 --> 00:19:21,101
I'm a friend.

380
00:19:21,135 --> 00:19:22,262
I'm giving you friendly advice.

381
00:19:22,304 --> 00:19:23,294
She's nothing but trouble.

382
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,742
Really? Well, I don't see

383
00:19:25,812 --> 00:19:27,441
that it's any of your
business who I see.

384
00:19:27,481 --> 00:19:29,246
In fact, I'm having
dinner with her now.

385
00:19:29,285 --> 00:19:31,380
Are you sure you're up to it?
You look tired.

386
00:19:31,422 --> 00:19:32,948
I feel fine.

387
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:36,524
No, no, no, you look
very, very, tired.

388
00:19:43,046 --> 00:19:45,346
Oh, God.

389
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,354
Funny, I...

390
00:19:47,388 --> 00:19:50,360
I do feel a bit... a bit spent.

391
00:19:50,394 --> 00:19:51,589
Maybe I should...

392
00:19:51,629 --> 00:19:55,068
Maybe I should go lie down
for a, for a minute.

393
00:19:57,074 --> 00:19:59,408
Hopefully, by yourself
for a change.

394
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:02,779
Bloody hell.

395
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:07,557
Sir, the Klingon scout ship
has departed Docking Bay 11.

396
00:20:07,594 --> 00:20:10,430
Good. I'll tell Odo
he can relax now.

397
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,238
We've got a problem, sir.

398
00:20:13,273 --> 00:20:15,072
I just saw Q
on the Promenade.

399
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,339
Q here?

400
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:17,574
What's Q?

401
00:20:17,614 --> 00:20:20,415
A powerful and extremely
unpredictable entity.

402
00:20:20,454 --> 00:20:23,585
I was at a Starfleet briefing
on him two years ago.

403
00:20:23,626 --> 00:20:25,425
Blasted menace is what he is.

404
00:20:25,464 --> 00:20:26,864
What does he want with us?

405
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:29,768
Whatever it is, you can
be sure we won't like it.

406
00:20:29,806 --> 00:20:31,104
You might ask Vash.

407
00:20:31,142 --> 00:20:32,167
Why Vash?

408
00:20:32,211 --> 00:20:33,577
They know each other.

409
00:20:33,613 --> 00:20:35,480
From the <i>Enterprise?</i>

410
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:37,987
I believe they actually met
in Sherwood Forest.

411
00:20:38,022 --> 00:20:40,015
It was one of
the little jokes

412
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,292
Q played on the <i>Enterprise</i> crew.

413
00:20:46,172 --> 00:20:48,438
Main power grid
has dropped 80%.

414
00:20:48,476 --> 00:20:51,471
Sensors are reading
a massive graviton build-up.

415
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:54,147
How long will it take to bring
us back up to full power?

416
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:55,919
It's already beginning
to normalize.

417
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,928
You know, if we have
one of these outages

418
00:20:57,962 --> 00:20:59,591
during a docking procedure

419
00:20:59,632 --> 00:21:01,693
we could lose
an entire pylon.

420
00:21:01,736 --> 00:21:03,102
I've double-checked
every system.

421
00:21:03,139 --> 00:21:04,402
For the first time in a month

422
00:21:04,442 --> 00:21:06,275
there's nothing wrong
with any of them.

423
00:21:06,312 --> 00:21:10,218
It's got to be Q...
another one of his stupid jokes.

424
00:21:10,253 --> 00:21:11,813
I'm not laughing.

425
00:21:13,126 --> 00:21:15,893
I figured we'd
auction this off last.

426
00:21:15,965 --> 00:21:19,564
Interesting, but hardly
of any intrinsic value.

427
00:21:19,605 --> 00:21:20,573
Really? I thought it was

428
00:21:20,607 --> 00:21:21,734
the best piece
in the collection.

429
00:21:21,776 --> 00:21:23,176
Oh, obviously,
my associates have

430
00:21:23,213 --> 00:21:24,306
more sophisticated tastes

431
00:21:24,348 --> 00:21:26,011
than what you're used to

432
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:28,649
but, uh, just so it's
not a total loss

433
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:31,183
I'll take it off
your hands for, say

434
00:21:31,229 --> 00:21:33,199
seven bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

435
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:34,930
It's worth 50 times as much.

436
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:36,529
Ridiculous.

437
00:21:39,578 --> 00:21:40,603
All right, 18

438
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:43,278
but you must swear
never to tell a soul

439
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:45,221
about my foolish generosity.

440
00:21:45,257 --> 00:21:47,124
If you want it, you're
going to have to be

441
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,458
a lot more foolish than that.

442
00:21:48,496 --> 00:21:49,964
All right, 30.

443
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,195
Now, give it to me.

444
00:21:51,235 --> 00:21:54,868
Bidding starts at 200
bars of gold latinum.

445
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:57,643
I can't decide
what's more intoxicating...

446
00:21:57,681 --> 00:22:01,142
this Gamzian wine,
or your negotiating skills.

447
00:22:01,188 --> 00:22:03,317
We need to talk.

448
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:06,820
The lady and I are having
a private conversation.

449
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,530
It can wait.

450
00:22:15,016 --> 00:22:18,182
Tell me, Commander, where
is that doctor of yours?

451
00:22:18,222 --> 00:22:21,285
He was supposed to meet me here
a half an hour ago.

452
00:22:21,329 --> 00:22:22,695
Tell me about Q.

453
00:22:22,731 --> 00:22:25,065
I'll tell you anything you
want to know, Commander.

454
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:28,502
Just answer one question...

455
00:22:28,543 --> 00:22:30,376
is Starfleet penalizing you

456
00:22:30,413 --> 00:22:33,613
or did you actually request
such a dismal command?

457
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,567
I want you off this station.

458
00:22:42,604 --> 00:22:45,303
Don't be hasty, my
happy-go-lucky friend.

459
00:22:45,343 --> 00:22:46,972
This dreary little gulag

460
00:22:47,014 --> 00:22:49,177
could use a little
color, some excitement.

461
00:22:49,218 --> 00:22:51,815
And who better
to provide that than moi?

462
00:22:51,856 --> 00:22:55,124
Although, I must admit,
I like your new tailor.

463
00:22:56,565 --> 00:22:59,001
I'm not impressed
by your parlor tricks.

464
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:01,372
These power outages
are going to stop, right now.

465
00:23:01,409 --> 00:23:02,707
Why tell me?

466
00:23:02,744 --> 00:23:04,714
Oh... oh, yes,
of course, go ahead

467
00:23:04,748 --> 00:23:07,447
blame Q if it makes
you feel any better.

468
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:08,477
I suppose it's my fate

469
00:23:08,523 --> 00:23:10,584
to be the galaxy's whipping boy.

470
00:23:10,627 --> 00:23:13,097
Oh, heavy is the burden
of being me.

471
00:23:13,132 --> 00:23:14,327
If you're looking for sympathy

472
00:23:14,368 --> 00:23:16,304
you've come to the wrong place.

473
00:23:16,338 --> 00:23:20,005
Actually, what I was hoping
for was a little witty repartee

474
00:23:20,113 --> 00:23:22,276
but I can see I'm not going
to get any of that either.

475
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,184
At least your beloved Jean-Luc

476
00:23:24,221 --> 00:23:26,157
knew how to turn a phrase.

477
00:23:26,192 --> 00:23:27,160
Take a hint, Q.

478
00:23:27,194 --> 00:23:29,164
No one wants you around.

479
00:23:29,198 --> 00:23:32,466
Really, Vash, this playing
hard to get is growing tedious.

480
00:23:32,504 --> 00:23:34,497
Let's not forget that I'm the Q

481
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:35,873
and you the lowly human.

482
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,677
I'll decide when
this partnership is over.

483
00:23:38,716 --> 00:23:40,014
Understand?

484
00:23:40,053 --> 00:23:41,180
Why don't you and I

485
00:23:41,222 --> 00:23:43,419
continue this discussion
in private?

486
00:23:43,459 --> 00:23:45,156
Excellent idea.

487
00:23:45,196 --> 00:23:46,687
You're right.

488
00:23:46,732 --> 00:23:48,702
This is an excellent idea.

489
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,262
Sisko to Ops.

490
00:23:50,306 --> 00:23:52,606
All gone.

491
00:23:54,181 --> 00:23:55,649
Bring them back, Q.

492
00:23:55,683 --> 00:23:56,651
Now!

493
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,846
Or what?

494
00:23:57,888 --> 00:23:59,448
You'll thrash me?

495
00:23:59,491 --> 00:24:02,691
Shall we settle
this mano a mano?

496
00:24:02,731 --> 00:24:04,997
Marquis of Queensberry rules?

497
00:24:05,036 --> 00:24:06,504
What?

498
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:10,809
Fisticuffs, pugilism,
the manly art of self-defense.

499
00:24:10,847 --> 00:24:13,010
Come on.

500
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:15,215
Isn't this all
wonderfully barbaric?

501
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:16,417
Go on, take a poke at me.

502
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:18,052
I know that's what
you really want to do.

503
00:24:18,162 --> 00:24:19,221
Come on.

504
00:24:19,264 --> 00:24:21,461
I'll wager five bars
of latinum on Sisko.

505
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:22,492
You're on.

506
00:24:22,537 --> 00:24:23,505
Fight back.

507
00:24:23,539 --> 00:24:25,907
This is supposed to be brutal.

508
00:24:33,826 --> 00:24:36,957
You can pay me
out of your profits

509
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,663
from the auction.

510
00:24:40,106 --> 00:24:41,404
You hit me.

511
00:24:41,442 --> 00:24:43,412
Picard never hit me.

512
00:24:43,446 --> 00:24:45,382
I'm not Picard.

513
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:46,406
Indeed not.

514
00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:49,424
You're much easier to provoke.

515
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:51,451
How fortunate for me.

516
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,723
Oh! Not again.

517
00:25:25,463 --> 00:25:28,128
Damn it, Q.
Enough is enough.

518
00:25:28,469 --> 00:25:29,767
We're losing atmosphere.

519
00:25:29,805 --> 00:25:31,137
Decompression protocol.

520
00:25:32,644 --> 00:25:35,582
Mr. O'Brien, raise
the confinement shields.

521
00:25:39,624 --> 00:25:40,683
Shields up.

522
00:25:40,727 --> 00:25:42,127
Damage report.

523
00:25:42,163 --> 00:25:43,962
We've got a minor hull breach

524
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,970
in one of the upper bulkheads.

525
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:47,530
I'm getting reports
of hull fractures

526
00:25:47,574 --> 00:25:49,100
throughout the station.

527
00:25:49,144 --> 00:25:50,943
Emergency systems

528
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,609
appear to be functioning.

529
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,244
Repair crews are responding.

530
00:25:59,431 --> 00:26:00,991
The breach was caused

531
00:26:01,034 --> 00:26:03,665
by some kind of focused
graviton pulse.

532
00:26:03,706 --> 00:26:06,074
Every time we've had
a power drain

533
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:07,374
it's been followed

534
00:26:07,414 --> 00:26:10,011
by an increase
in the graviton field.

535
00:26:10,052 --> 00:26:11,145
If this continues,
we could wind up

536
00:26:11,255 --> 00:26:13,020
with a breach in one
of our reactor cores.

537
00:26:13,058 --> 00:26:14,151
We'd lose half the station.

538
00:26:14,261 --> 00:26:15,627
Maybe it's time

539
00:26:15,663 --> 00:26:17,792
we opened
negotiations with Q.

540
00:26:17,834 --> 00:26:20,465
I'm not convinced Q
is behind this.

541
00:26:20,506 --> 00:26:22,442
Playing with the lights and
punching holes in the hull

542
00:26:22,477 --> 00:26:25,400
doesn't strike me as his style.

543
00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:28,971
You wanted to see me?

544
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:30,065
Make it quick.

545
00:26:30,109 --> 00:26:32,045
I have important business.

546
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:33,138
Yes, I know.

547
00:26:33,182 --> 00:26:36,348
You're auctioning off
some artifacts

548
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:38,585
from the Gamma Quadrant.

549
00:26:38,626 --> 00:26:43,398
You were eavesdropping
on my conversation with Vash.

550
00:26:45,406 --> 00:26:48,401
What were you this time?

551
00:26:48,446 --> 00:26:52,511
The table? One of the chairs?

552
00:26:52,554 --> 00:26:55,185
The wine bottle.

553
00:26:55,226 --> 00:26:57,594
When are you going to realize

554
00:26:57,631 --> 00:27:00,296
that you have
no secrets from me?

555
00:27:00,336 --> 00:27:01,395
I have nothing to hide.

556
00:27:01,438 --> 00:27:03,908
I'm selling quality merchandise
to select clientele.

557
00:27:03,943 --> 00:27:07,576
And what makes them so select?

558
00:27:07,617 --> 00:27:10,885
They're all
ridiculously wealthy...

559
00:27:10,924 --> 00:27:14,055
and not too bright.

560
00:27:14,096 --> 00:27:16,396
I'll never understand
this obsession

561
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:17,528
with accumulating

562
00:27:17,571 --> 00:27:18,766
material wealth.

563
00:27:18,873 --> 00:27:21,572
You spend your entire life
plotting and scheming

564
00:27:21,612 --> 00:27:23,775
to acquire more
and more possessions

565
00:27:23,883 --> 00:27:26,183
until your living
areas are bursting

566
00:27:26,221 --> 00:27:27,416
with useless junk.

567
00:27:27,457 --> 00:27:28,584
Then you die.

568
00:27:28,626 --> 00:27:30,596
Your relatives sell everything

569
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,964
and start the cycle
all over again.

570
00:27:38,144 --> 00:27:43,143
Isn't there anything
you... desire?

571
00:27:43,189 --> 00:27:44,749
I have my work.

572
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:46,818
What more do I need?

573
00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:49,833
A suit of the finest
Andorian silk?

574
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:54,742
A ring of pure Surax?

575
00:27:54,778 --> 00:27:56,304
A complete set

576
00:27:56,348 --> 00:27:59,411
of Tanesh pottery?

577
00:27:59,454 --> 00:28:01,014
How about

578
00:28:01,057 --> 00:28:04,792
a latinum-plated
bucket to sleep in?

579
00:28:07,971 --> 00:28:08,996
Ah.

580
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,135
Ahh...

581
00:28:18,426 --> 00:28:20,328
Well, I'm glad to see
you've packed.

582
00:28:20,363 --> 00:28:23,130
I hope you said good-bye
to all your newfound friends.

583
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,466
I don't have
time for this.

584
00:28:24,504 --> 00:28:27,567
You've led a charmed life
these past two years

585
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,637
under my benevolent
protection.

586
00:28:29,681 --> 00:28:31,412
I can take care of myself.

587
00:28:31,452 --> 00:28:33,479
Really?

588
00:28:33,522 --> 00:28:36,585
Do you remember
that tiny little insect bite

589
00:28:36,628 --> 00:28:39,794
you had on Erabus Prime?

590
00:28:39,835 --> 00:28:42,101
If I hadn't been there...

591
00:28:47,884 --> 00:28:50,617
I am not going with you.

592
00:28:50,656 --> 00:28:52,785
The galaxy
can be a dangerous place

593
00:28:52,827 --> 00:28:54,558
when you're on your own.

594
00:28:59,841 --> 00:29:02,073
It's over, Q.

595
00:29:12,534 --> 00:29:15,995
I leave you now to reconsider
my offer of friendship.

596
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:38,015
Station Log, Stardate 46531.2.

597
00:29:38,051 --> 00:29:40,579
The station's power is
continuing to be drained

598
00:29:40,623 --> 00:29:42,252
and converted into gravitons.

599
00:29:42,293 --> 00:29:46,233
At this rate, our life-support
systems will fail in 14 hours.

600
00:29:46,267 --> 00:29:49,262
Sir, we'll never find
the source of the power drain

601
00:29:49,307 --> 00:29:51,641
using these bloody Cardassian
internal sensors.

602
00:29:51,678 --> 00:29:53,409
They're just
not sensitive enough.

603
00:29:53,449 --> 00:29:55,851
What if we make the power drain
easier to detect.

604
00:29:55,887 --> 00:29:58,757
If we flood the station
with ionized tritium gas

605
00:29:58,792 --> 00:30:00,762
we should be able to trace
the particle flow

606
00:30:00,796 --> 00:30:01,923
to the source.

607
00:30:01,965 --> 00:30:03,092
Tritium?

608
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,831
Well isn't that pretty toxic?

609
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:07,171
Only when it's highly
concentrated.

610
00:30:07,209 --> 00:30:08,769
We'd only use
a very small amount.

611
00:30:08,812 --> 00:30:10,144
Do it.

612
00:30:10,181 --> 00:30:13,381
Unless we get this under control
in the next eight hours

613
00:30:13,422 --> 00:30:15,790
we'll begin
evacuation procedures.

614
00:30:15,826 --> 00:30:16,953
Still chasing your own tail?

615
00:30:16,995 --> 00:30:18,395
Picard and his lackeys

616
00:30:18,432 --> 00:30:20,629
would have solved all this
technobabble hours ago.

617
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:23,801
No wonder you're not
commanding a starship.

618
00:30:23,842 --> 00:30:25,310
Security to Ops.

619
00:30:25,346 --> 00:30:28,318
Well, aren't we the feisty
little go-getter.

620
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,322
I'd keep my eye on this one.

621
00:30:30,356 --> 00:30:31,585
Chances are

622
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:33,116
she's after your job.

623
00:30:33,161 --> 00:30:35,997
Why don't you do something
constructive for a change...

624
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:38,003
like torment Cardassians.

625
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:39,836
Do I know you?

626
00:30:39,874 --> 00:30:43,005
O'Brien. From the <i>Enterprise.</i>

627
00:30:43,047 --> 00:30:44,345
<i>Enterprise?</i>

628
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,682
Oh, yes.

629
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,385
Weren't you one
of the little people?

630
00:30:50,261 --> 00:30:53,324
Quite a motley crew
you've assembled here, Benji.

631
00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:56,603
My advice to you
is to evacuate now

632
00:30:56,641 --> 00:30:59,374
and save all this
pointless guesswork.

633
00:30:59,447 --> 00:31:01,280
Q, either you tell us
what's going on

634
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,843
or get the hell
out of the way.

635
00:31:02,887 --> 00:31:04,618
I'll tell you
what's going on.

636
00:31:04,657 --> 00:31:07,561
While you're here conducting
futile experiments

637
00:31:07,597 --> 00:31:09,999
Vash is below engaged
in base commerce

638
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,664
and setting Federation ethics

639
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:13,436
back 200 years.

640
00:31:13,475 --> 00:31:16,345
Believe me, gang

641
00:31:16,381 --> 00:31:19,946
she's far more dangerous to you
than I.

642
00:31:31,745 --> 00:31:33,077
Kolos, my friend.

643
00:31:33,147 --> 00:31:35,948
I don't know
which pleases me more...

644
00:31:35,986 --> 00:31:39,687
your smiling face
or your overflowing purse.

645
00:31:39,727 --> 00:31:41,594
Quark, you obsequious toad.

646
00:31:41,631 --> 00:31:42,758
Your so-called

647
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,861
Gamma Quadrant merchandise

648
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:46,270
had better be legitimate

649
00:31:46,307 --> 00:31:48,675
or I'll toss you out
the nearest airlock.

650
00:31:48,712 --> 00:31:50,112
No cause for alarm.

651
00:31:50,181 --> 00:31:52,242
Each piece comes complete

652
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:56,020
with a statement of authenticity
from Vash...

653
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,654
the Federation's foremost expert

654
00:31:57,697 --> 00:31:59,667
on the Gamma Quadrant.

655
00:31:59,701 --> 00:32:03,971
In that case, stop sniveling
and give me a synthale.

656
00:32:09,587 --> 00:32:11,750
Are they all that pleasant?

657
00:32:13,427 --> 00:32:15,955
I don't care
about their manners.

658
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,731
The important thing is

659
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:21,733
they're honest collectors
of antiquities... every one.

660
00:32:21,778 --> 00:32:23,577
How honest?

661
00:32:23,615 --> 00:32:25,517
As honest as you and I.

662
00:32:25,553 --> 00:32:28,787
Well, then, we'd better keep
a close eye on them.

663
00:32:28,825 --> 00:32:32,286
My dear, I've been thinking.

664
00:32:32,332 --> 00:32:37,434
What would you say to
a permanent partnership?

665
00:32:37,476 --> 00:32:40,778
What with your knowledge
of the Gamma Quadrant

666
00:32:40,816 --> 00:32:44,847
and my business connections,
we could make a fortune.

667
00:32:44,891 --> 00:32:47,863
Sorry, Quark, but I've slept
in my last tent.

668
00:32:47,897 --> 00:32:51,564
I'm looking forward to a nice,
quiet life back on Earth.

669
00:32:51,605 --> 00:32:53,165
You won't last a month.

670
00:32:53,274 --> 00:32:54,640
You're like me.

671
00:32:54,677 --> 00:32:57,342
You live for excitement,
adventure and profit.

672
00:32:57,382 --> 00:32:59,375
Not anymore.

673
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:02,220
Would you care to make
a wager on that?

674
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:08,635
The graviton field
has increased by 60%.

675
00:33:08,672 --> 00:33:11,108
How soon can we begin
the sensor sweep?

676
00:33:11,143 --> 00:33:13,045
Not until we've increased
tritium levels

677
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,241
to one part per million.

678
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:16,378
Should only be another
seven, eight minutes.

679
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,083
Commander, we're being pulled

680
00:33:18,124 --> 00:33:20,060
out of our normal position.

681
00:33:20,094 --> 00:33:21,893
Use control thrusters
to stabilize the station.

682
00:33:21,931 --> 00:33:24,401
Firing thrusters.

683
00:33:30,448 --> 00:33:32,538
We're still moving.

684
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,970
If the graviton field

685
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:35,601
is feeding off
the station's power

686
00:33:35,645 --> 00:33:38,412
maybe we can cut its supply
by shutting down the reactors.

687
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,420
Put life-support
on emergency backup.

688
00:33:40,454 --> 00:33:42,048
Take everything else off line.

689
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:49,137
We're still moving
out of position.

690
00:33:49,171 --> 00:33:51,403
What's our heading?

691
00:33:51,442 --> 00:33:55,780
Bearing 157 mark 13.

692
00:33:55,818 --> 00:33:57,981
Straight into the wormhole.

693
00:34:14,155 --> 00:34:16,387
Now, as you know

694
00:34:16,426 --> 00:34:19,626
payment must be
in gold-pressed latinum

695
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:23,731
and all transactions
are final. Hmm?

696
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,581
Remember, bid high,
and bid often.

697
00:34:31,089 --> 00:34:32,683
Ladies and gentlemen

698
00:34:32,726 --> 00:34:34,457
our first item is a statue

699
00:34:34,495 --> 00:34:37,126
from the Gamma Quadrant's
Verath system.

700
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:39,034
Now, I suppose
I should take a minute

701
00:34:39,105 --> 00:34:41,736
to tell you a little bit
about the Verathan civilization

702
00:34:41,777 --> 00:34:46,549
which reached its height
some 30,000 years ago

703
00:34:46,587 --> 00:34:49,023
and spanned
over two dozen systems

704
00:34:49,058 --> 00:34:51,221
interconnected
by a highly developed trade

705
00:34:51,262 --> 00:34:52,730
and communications network.

706
00:34:52,766 --> 00:34:54,702
This statue
represents Drohlak...

707
00:34:54,736 --> 00:34:57,172
the Prime Ossemite
of the 19th dynasty.

708
00:34:57,207 --> 00:34:58,505
Vash, what are you doing?

709
00:34:58,543 --> 00:35:01,538
I'm placing the statue
in its historical context.

710
00:35:01,582 --> 00:35:02,709
Give me that.

711
00:35:02,752 --> 00:35:05,815
This isn't
the Daystrom Institute.

712
00:35:05,858 --> 00:35:07,156
Watch closely.

713
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,798
Friends...

714
00:35:11,837 --> 00:35:13,568
it's rare...

715
00:35:13,606 --> 00:35:15,599
it's beautiful...

716
00:35:15,645 --> 00:35:18,742
and it's
a Gamma Quadrant original!

717
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:21,016
And it can be yours
for the right price.

718
00:35:21,055 --> 00:35:25,793
Bidding will start at ten bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

719
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,323
Make it ten.

720
00:35:27,367 --> 00:35:29,769
Fifteen?

721
00:35:29,806 --> 00:35:31,639
Sixteen?

722
00:35:31,677 --> 00:35:33,043
Who will say 17

723
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:36,574
and be the first to own a piece
of the Gamma Quadrant?

724
00:35:36,619 --> 00:35:38,589
Tritium levels
throughout the station

725
00:35:38,623 --> 00:35:41,093
have reached one part
per million.

726
00:35:41,128 --> 00:35:43,462
Initiating sensor sweep.

727
00:35:46,505 --> 00:35:48,998
We can rule out
the docking ring.

728
00:35:49,044 --> 00:35:51,641
The tritium gas
seems to be draining towards

729
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:52,776
the central core.

730
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:54,287
Where in the central core?

731
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:57,225
Let me see if I can get
a more precise reading.

732
00:35:58,697 --> 00:36:00,428
It's not clear enough.

733
00:36:01,435 --> 00:36:03,928
I can't pinpoint
an exact location.

734
00:36:03,974 --> 00:36:06,639
Based on our current trajectory

735
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,914
we'll hit the wormhole
in 18 minutes.

736
00:36:09,953 --> 00:36:11,547
What the hell

737
00:36:11,589 --> 00:36:14,082
could be pulling us
into the wormhole?

738
00:36:14,128 --> 00:36:16,964
Do we have time
to transfer auxiliary power

739
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,697
to the deflectors, Chief?

740
00:36:18,737 --> 00:36:20,103
Sir, there's not
enough power left

741
00:36:20,206 --> 00:36:21,196
to make any difference.

742
00:36:21,242 --> 00:36:23,041
If we get sucked
into that wormhole

743
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:24,308
we'll be in a billion pieces

744
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,113
by the time we reach
the Gamma Quadrant.

745
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:34,596
Sold to Kolos for 36 bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

746
00:36:37,541 --> 00:36:39,568
Next, we have...

747
00:36:41,215 --> 00:36:42,741
a dagger...

748
00:36:43,754 --> 00:36:47,626
studded with some
very interesting-looking gems.

749
00:36:48,696 --> 00:36:49,789
Think of it

750
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:52,771
as a weapon and an investment.

751
00:36:52,805 --> 00:36:55,173
Bidding will start at 40.

752
00:36:55,276 --> 00:36:56,973
Forty.

753
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,577
Forty-two?

754
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:01,018
Forty-two.

755
00:37:01,055 --> 00:37:02,353
Forty-five?

756
00:37:02,391 --> 00:37:04,384
Don't hold back.

757
00:37:04,428 --> 00:37:07,093
You know you want it.

758
00:37:07,134 --> 00:37:08,534
Give me 50.

759
00:37:08,569 --> 00:37:10,471
50. We have 50.

760
00:37:10,507 --> 00:37:11,668
I hate to interrupt

761
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:14,145
such a thrilling display
of naked avarice

762
00:37:14,248 --> 00:37:16,445
but I thought
it was only right of me

763
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:19,616
to warn you that this station
is hurtling towards its doom

764
00:37:19,658 --> 00:37:21,958
and it's very unlikely

765
00:37:21,997 --> 00:37:25,026
that any of you will survive
to enjoy your purchases.

766
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,801
I just thought I'd mention it.

767
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,865
Please, carry on.

768
00:37:27,909 --> 00:37:30,072
Ladies and gentlemen,
I assure you

769
00:37:30,113 --> 00:37:31,980
everything is under control.

770
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:33,280
Drinks for everyone

771
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:35,050
and free use of the holosuites

772
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:37,287
at the conclusion
of the auction, eh?

773
00:37:37,327 --> 00:37:39,924
I don't think I realized
until this moment

774
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,457
how evil you really are.

775
00:37:41,502 --> 00:37:43,404
You would kill
all these people

776
00:37:43,439 --> 00:37:44,737
to get even with me.

777
00:37:44,776 --> 00:37:47,680
Well, I must admit,
the thought had occurred to me

778
00:37:47,714 --> 00:37:50,550
but this station is
in enough trouble without me

779
00:37:50,587 --> 00:37:52,557
although I'd be glad
to save you.

780
00:37:52,591 --> 00:37:54,151
All you have to do is ask.

781
00:37:54,194 --> 00:37:57,132
I'll take my chances
with the others.

782
00:37:57,167 --> 00:37:58,035
As you choose.

783
00:37:58,035 --> 00:37:58,364
As you choose.

784
00:37:58,402 --> 00:38:01,636
I'm going to just sit
right here and watch.

785
00:38:01,675 --> 00:38:06,743
I've never seen a space station
torn apart by a wormhole before.

786
00:38:06,786 --> 00:38:07,754
100!

787
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:10,020
Sold to my cousin Stol

788
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:12,963
for 105 bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

789
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,901
What if we pumped
more tritium gas

790
00:38:14,936 --> 00:38:16,199
into the central core?

791
00:38:16,272 --> 00:38:17,433
The sensors might
be more accurate

792
00:38:17,474 --> 00:38:18,533
with a greater concentration.

793
00:38:18,576 --> 00:38:19,601
It might work

794
00:38:19,645 --> 00:38:21,638
but, in four years,
we'd all be dead

795
00:38:21,682 --> 00:38:23,116
from tritium poisoning.

796
00:38:23,152 --> 00:38:24,211
Wait a minute.

797
00:38:24,254 --> 00:38:25,222
Of course.

798
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:26,987
Bring the reactors back on line.

799
00:38:27,027 --> 00:38:27,995
The reactors?

800
00:38:28,029 --> 00:38:29,190
But they'll just
feed more energy

801
00:38:29,231 --> 00:38:30,631
into the graviton field.

802
00:38:30,667 --> 00:38:32,193
If we generate enough energy

803
00:38:32,237 --> 00:38:35,073
it should create a power drain
big enough to trace.

804
00:38:35,109 --> 00:38:37,910
It might also push us faster
into the wormhole.

805
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:38,974
A lot faster.

806
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:41,078
It's a chance we've got to take.

807
00:38:41,121 --> 00:38:43,250
Bring us to full
power, Mr. O'Brien.

808
00:38:43,292 --> 00:38:44,624
Everything you've got.

809
00:38:44,661 --> 00:38:46,528
Aye, sir.

810
00:38:48,002 --> 00:38:50,940
Sold to Rul the Obscure

811
00:38:50,975 --> 00:38:54,881
for 151 latinum bars.

812
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:57,182
And now...

813
00:39:01,228 --> 00:39:03,927
our final item

814
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:06,871
and I think you'll
agree with me

815
00:39:06,906 --> 00:39:11,040
it was well worth the wait.

816
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,084
Bidding will start

817
00:39:17,127 --> 00:39:23,003
at 200 bars of
gold-pressed latinum.

818
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:24,405
200?

819
00:39:24,441 --> 00:39:26,775
Can I get 250?

820
00:39:26,812 --> 00:39:29,477
250. 300, anyone?

821
00:39:29,518 --> 00:39:33,151
300 bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

822
00:39:33,192 --> 00:39:34,285
350?

823
00:39:34,328 --> 00:39:35,421
Here.

824
00:39:35,463 --> 00:39:36,556
400?

825
00:39:36,598 --> 00:39:38,295
400.

826
00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:39,667
Five?

827
00:39:39,705 --> 00:39:41,299
520?

828
00:39:43,512 --> 00:39:48,045
600 bars of gold-
pressed latinum.

829
00:39:48,089 --> 00:39:50,822
It's not in any
of the crossover bridges

830
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,591
or in the habitat ring.

831
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,327
It's in the upper core.

832
00:39:54,401 --> 00:39:55,334
Three minutes

833
00:39:55,403 --> 00:39:57,532
14 seconds to the wormhole.

834
00:39:57,574 --> 00:39:59,441
We're picking up speed.

835
00:39:59,478 --> 00:40:00,844
I've got it.

836
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,077
The power drain's coming
from the Promenade.

837
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,178
Chief, you have Ops.

838
00:40:07,293 --> 00:40:09,525
2,500.

839
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:15,771
2,500, and one.

840
00:40:23,994 --> 00:40:25,257
This way.

841
00:40:32,477 --> 00:40:34,538
3,000 bars of latinum.

842
00:40:34,581 --> 00:40:35,592
My final offer.

843
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,319
3,000 bars!

844
00:40:37,362 --> 00:40:39,594
A million.

845
00:40:41,137 --> 00:40:43,630
A million bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

846
00:40:45,011 --> 00:40:46,309
- Over here.
- A million going once...

847
00:40:46,347 --> 00:40:47,315
It's by the podium.

848
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:48,317
A million going twice...

849
00:40:48,351 --> 00:40:49,319
That's it.

850
00:40:49,353 --> 00:40:50,321
Three times.

851
00:40:50,355 --> 00:40:51,584
This auction's over.

852
00:40:51,624 --> 00:40:52,592
Sold.

853
00:40:52,626 --> 00:40:53,958
Chief, shut down the reactors.

854
00:40:53,996 --> 00:40:54,964
We've found it.

855
00:40:54,998 --> 00:40:57,093
And it's about time, too.

856
00:40:57,135 --> 00:40:58,798
Sorry, all transactions
are final.

857
00:40:58,838 --> 00:41:01,810
This item belongs
to that gentleman over there.

858
00:41:01,844 --> 00:41:03,939
I'm reading a massive
graviton build-up

859
00:41:03,982 --> 00:41:05,143
inside this container.

860
00:41:05,185 --> 00:41:06,619
It's increasing exponentially.

861
00:41:06,654 --> 00:41:08,385
We have to get it
off the station now.

862
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,621
Chief, lock onto my combadge.

863
00:41:10,662 --> 00:41:14,397
Prepare to transport it
500 meters off the docking ring.

864
00:41:14,436 --> 00:41:16,167
But I haven't been paid.

865
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,470
Energize.

866
00:41:48,471 --> 00:41:52,411
Station Log, Stardate 46532.3.

867
00:41:52,445 --> 00:41:54,711
With the embryonic life-form
off the station

868
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,913
graviton levels
have returned to normal.

869
00:41:56,954 --> 00:41:58,445
We've used
the control thrusters

870
00:41:58,491 --> 00:42:01,292
to return the station
to its original position.

871
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:05,395
So... you're off to
the Daystrom Institute.

872
00:42:05,438 --> 00:42:07,431
Bet you can hardly wait.

873
00:42:07,475 --> 00:42:10,970
Long, boring lectures,
endless conferences

874
00:42:11,015 --> 00:42:15,821
whining students
dogging your every step.

875
00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:17,259
Sounds delightful.

876
00:42:17,295 --> 00:42:19,424
Of course...

877
00:42:20,568 --> 00:42:23,233
No, you wouldn't be interested.

878
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:24,401
In what?

879
00:42:27,449 --> 00:42:30,980
I hear they've
uncovered the ruins

880
00:42:31,022 --> 00:42:34,426
of a Rokai provincial
capital on Tartaras V.

881
00:42:34,463 --> 00:42:38,904
If you could obtain
some Rokain artifacts...

882
00:42:38,938 --> 00:42:40,601
Forget it, Quark.

883
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:42,612
I'm going back to Earth.

884
00:42:42,646 --> 00:42:44,377
Have it your way.

885
00:42:44,416 --> 00:42:46,147
An abysmal place.

886
00:42:47,455 --> 00:42:49,357
Tartaras V?

887
00:42:49,393 --> 00:42:51,956
Earth. Oh, don't get me wrong.

888
00:42:51,997 --> 00:42:54,901
1,000 years ago,
it had character.

889
00:42:54,937 --> 00:42:58,398
Crusades, Spanish Inquisition,
Watergate.

890
00:42:58,444 --> 00:43:01,382
Now it's just
mind-numbingly dull.

891
00:43:01,417 --> 00:43:04,719
Well, then, by all means,
don't come with me.

892
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:08,426
I think you'd be much happier

893
00:43:08,464 --> 00:43:11,664
poking about the ruins
of Tartaras V.

894
00:43:11,704 --> 00:43:13,731
I don't need your advice.

895
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,843
You really think I?

896
00:43:18,718 --> 00:43:21,713
You know, I still feel
that I owe you

897
00:43:21,757 --> 00:43:24,854
a million bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

898
00:43:24,896 --> 00:43:27,366
Keep it... just give
me back my life.

899
00:43:27,402 --> 00:43:29,099
You'll regret it if I do.

900
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:31,301
I'm willing to
take my chances.

901
00:43:31,343 --> 00:43:34,713
All right, if you insist.

902
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,982
But it's not going
to be the same without you.

903
00:43:37,021 --> 00:43:40,893
When I look at a gas nebula,
all I see is a cloud of dust.

904
00:43:40,928 --> 00:43:42,898
Seeing the universe
through your eyes

905
00:43:42,932 --> 00:43:47,704
I was able to experience...
wonder.

906
00:43:47,742 --> 00:43:50,178
I'm going to miss that.

907
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:56,624
Well, I guess in some ways,
I'm going to miss you, too.

908
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,928
Maybe I could
drop in sometime.

909
00:43:59,966 --> 00:44:01,765
Oh, God, I hope not.

910
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:04,835
Hey, Quark.

911
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:07,677
What's the quickest way
to Tartaras V?

912
00:44:07,715 --> 00:44:08,944
Ah...

913
00:44:22,912 --> 00:44:25,816
I feel as though
I've been asleep for days.

914
00:44:26,854 --> 00:44:28,414
What?

915
00:44:29,626 --> 00:44:31,721
Did I miss something?
