00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,921
<i>Last time on</i>
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...

2
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:05,130
This is intolerable.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,299
They have us caged
up like animals.

4
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,092
(<i> electronically</i>
<i>distorted voice</i> )

5
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:14,222
Stop it!

6
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:15,349
(<i> gasps</i> )

7
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:16,809
(<i> grunts</i> )

8
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,940
We meet at last.

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,232
(<i> distorted voices</i> )

10
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,901
Gifts?

11
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,528
How thoughtful.

12
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:30,322
You should be honored.

13
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:33,200
You're witnessing
an historic moment--

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,952
the birth of the alliance

15
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:38,246
between the Dominion
and the Breen.

16
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,749
<i>And now the continuation.</i>

17
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,170
We will secure
the prisoners below.

18
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,421
They will<i> share</i> a cell.

19
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,007
They may wish to...

20
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:51,677
physically comfort each other
on the long trip back

21
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,554
to Cardassia.

22
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,723
I find interspecies

23
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:58,099
mating rituals
fascinating to watch.

24
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,101
(<i> groans</i> )

25
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,317
(<i> panting</i> )

26
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,571
Interesting device.

27
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,280
Oh, I am so sorry.

28
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,991
Where are my manners?

29
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,117
Allow me to introduce
Legate Damar

30
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,578
leader of the
Cardassian Union.

31
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:18,620
Thot Gor.

32
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,163
Thot.

33
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,583
That's the equivalent
of a Legate, isn't it?

34
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,334
(<i> distorted voice</i> )

35
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,669
(<i> chuckles</i> )

36
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:26,921
What did he say?

37
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:28,463
He says, "You
need to have

38
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,925
your universal
translator adjusted."

39
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:32,091
I would have if I'd known

40
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,802
we were meeting
with the Breen.

41
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:57,910
It is a distinct pleasure
to finally meet you.

42
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,869
(<i> distorted voice</i> )

43
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,287
Thank you.

44
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,123
If our face-to-face talks
are as productive

45
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,166
as our subspace
communications

46
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,420
have been, I'm sure we'll
sign the treaty documents

47
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,922
within a few days.

48
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:11,006
I haven't even seen
this treaty.

49
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,674
We'll discuss it later.

50
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,259
FOUNDER:
The alliance between
the Breen Confederacy

51
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,096
and the Dominion will end
this destructive war

52
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:19,473
that has torn this
Quadrant apart.

53
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,182
With the Breen at our side

54
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:24,311
the Federation will not be able
to stand against us.

55
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,522
They'll be erased
from the face of the galaxy.

56
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,067
This is outrageous.

57
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,735
Have you read
this treaty?

58
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,278
Parts of it.

59
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,155
There's a reference
to territorial concessions

60
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,698
that the Cardassians
are to make to the Breen

61
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,159
but it doesn't say what
those concessions are.

62
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,660
Oh, you needn't worry
about that.

63
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,123
It's all been itemized
in a secret protocol

64
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:50,749
between the Dominion
and the Breen.

65
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:54,086
All that is required of you
is to sign the document

66
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:56,713
as the acknowledged leader
of the Cardassian Union.

67
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,381
I want to see this protocol.

68
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,009
Then it wouldn't be much
of a secret then, would it?

69
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,178
You expect me to agree
to territorial concessions

70
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,930
when I haven't even seen
what they are?

71
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,016
Damar, you are missing
the point.

72
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:11,728
We need the Breen
to win this war.

73
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,647
When it's over

74
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,524
there will be more than enough
territories available

75
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:20,737
to compensate Cardassia for
the loss of a few minor planets.

76
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,364
There are no<i> minor</i> planets
in the Cardassian Union.

77
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,366
(<i> sighs</i> )

78
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,785
Do you know what I think
you should do?

79
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,203
Talk to Thot Gor.

80
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,288
Express your concerns.

81
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:30,747
He's very reasonable

82
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,207
and quite personable
when you get to know him.

83
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,708
I don't trust him
or his people.

84
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,002
(<i> chuckling</i> )

85
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,670
The Founders should
never have agreed

86
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,379
to give away Cardassian
territory without my consent.

87
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,798
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,800
I think I misunderstood you.

89
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,427
It sounded
as if you were implying

90
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,264
that Cardassian territory
doesn't belong to the Founders.

91
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,932
Surely, that isn't
what you meant.

92
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:54,562
No, of course not.

93
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,397
Oh, good.

94
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:59,734
I look forward to receiving
the signed documents from you

95
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,195
within the hour.

96
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,326
Is there something else?

97
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:10,495
The Klingons have attacked
Septimus III.

98
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,289
I'm aware of that.

99
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,666
Are you also aware that
they've landed 15 divisions?

100
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,959
The Cardassian troops

101
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,669
will never survive
without reinforcements.

102
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,171
I assure you

103
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:22,549
the Septimus III situation
will be dealt with.

104
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:27,137
We will not allow your brave
soldiers to perish in vain.

105
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,306
You have my word.

106
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,649
(<i> Martok laughing</i> )

107
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,152
Septimus III will fall
within the week.

108
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,572
Huh! The Cardassian 11th Order.

109
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,533
It's a reserve unit--
old men and walking wounded.

110
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,160
They don't stand a chance.

111
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,745
I think
you're right.

112
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,622
But enough about the war
with the Dominion.

113
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,750
I want to hear
about the war at home.

114
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,420
You just married that...
freighter captain, didn't you?

115
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,881
Yes.

116
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:06,093
Then war has broken out,
whether you know it or not--

117
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:10,972
a long, grueling,
intoxicating war.

118
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,933
I remember the day

119
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,352
my beloved Sirella moved
into my home.

120
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,187
(<i> chuckles</i> )

121
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,357
I had a pet<i> targ,</i> 
had him since I was a boy--

122
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:23,110
a filthy, mangy beast

123
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,322
but in his bony breast
beat the heart of a warrior.

124
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:30,284
Of course,
Sirella loathed him.

125
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,702
Well, to make
a long story short

126
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:36,290
while she was supervising
the unloading of her bags

127
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:41,586
Sirella<i> accidentally</i> left
the front door open

128
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:46,091
and my faithful<i> targ,</i> ever ready
to follow the call of the wild

129
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,260
tottered outside
on his frail legs

130
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,138
and disappeared
into the forest.

131
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,431
(<i> sighs</i> )

132
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:55,600
I never laid eyes on him again.

133
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,812
Lady Sirella draws
the first blood.

134
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,565
You see my point.

135
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,277
Don't get me wrong.

136
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:09,990
I would not trade Sirella
for all the<i> targs</i> on<i> Qo'noS</i>

137
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,492
and, over the course
of our marriage

138
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,162
I've won more than my fair share
of battles between us

139
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,830
but in the end...

140
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,832
I know...

141
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:22,919
she will win the war.

142
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,506
I'll keep that in mind.

143
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,049
(<i> chuckling</i> )

144
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,260
WINN:
You ate all the milaberries.

145
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:36,641
Mm. Well, then have
Solbor bring us more.

146
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,767
(<i> chuckles</i> )

147
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,436
And give him
another chance

148
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,854
to frown disapprovingly?

149
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,106
(<i> both laugh</i> )

150
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:46,276
The good Ranjen doesn't
much care for me, does he?

151
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,403
You'd think
he'd be pleased

152
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,405
to see his Kai
so happy.

153
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,201
Are you happy, Adami?

154
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,828
More than I've ever
been in my life.

155
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,124
The Prophets are
smiling on us.

156
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,417
Hmm.

157
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,751
They've not only
brought us together

158
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,380
but they've given us
a great task--

159
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,549
the Restoration
of Bajor.

160
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:15,305
Our world will be reborn,
and<i> you</i> will be its leader.

161
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,391
A sacred responsibility.

162
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,892
Yes.

163
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,402
I pray that I'll have
the strength to do

164
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,445
what the Prophets
are asking of me.

165
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:37,160
I will be
at your side.

166
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,661
We won't fail them.

167
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,332
But the Restoration

168
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,751
will not come
without struggle.

169
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,169
There will be those

170
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,255
who will stand
in our way.

171
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,340
It is not allowed
to interfere

172
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,426
with the will
of the Prophets.

173
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:57,556
Even those who<i> claim</i> 
to speak in their name.

174
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,474
The Emissary.

175
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:03,270
Mm. In your
vision...

176
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,565
the Prophets said
he'd faltered.

177
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,152
I can only<i> hope</i>

178
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:14,197
that he doesn't choose
to oppose them.

179
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,575
Their love is strong...

180
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,952
but so is their wrath.

181
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,466
I hate to say it

182
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,759
but this is doing wonders
for my back.

183
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,678
I doubt that is what
our captors had in mind.

184
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:38,930
Probably not.

185
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,099
We must get back
to the station

186
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,601
and warn Starfleet
about the Breen.

187
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:43,893
You're right.

188
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,687
There's just
a few problems.

189
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,689
We're on a Jem'Hadar ship

190
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,942
heading
in the wrong direction

191
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:55,196
hanging upside down,
and...

192
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,864
And what?

193
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:00,285
I'm think I'm getting spacesick.

194
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:15,925
(<i> sighs</i> )

195
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,720
Well, welcome home,
Mrs. Sisko.

196
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,056
Well, thank you,
Mr. Sisko.

197
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:24,643
Mmm.

198
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,769
So, how was
your cargo run?

199
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,062
Interesting.

200
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,857
It seems my Bajoran
crew members

201
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,275
have decided
that serving

202
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,943
under the<i> wife</i> 
of the Emissary

203
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,279
is a little different
than serving

204
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,114
under his girlfriend.

205
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,576
I've known some of those people
for ten years or more

206
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,120
and suddenly,
they're asking<i> me</i> for advice

207
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,123
about their children,
their wives, their husbands

208
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,750
their spiritual relationship
with the Prophets.

209
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,628
Welcome to the club.

210
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,630
Which reminds me...

211
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,675
every spring, the Emissary
holds a little ceremony

212
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,885
to bless the women on the
station who want to be mothers.

213
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,221
What does this have
to do with me?

214
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,891
There's been a request made--
several, in fact--

215
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,685
that the new wife

216
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:09,937
of the Emissary perform
the ceremony this year--

217
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,231
this week, actually.

218
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,483
No.

219
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,402
Kasidy...

220
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,111
<i>No.</i> I've got

221
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,779
to draw the
line somewhere.

222
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,448
I married you,
I didn't convert.

223
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,991
And I'm not going
to start...

224
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,994
acting like I suddenly
believe in the Prophets.

225
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,496
I wouldn't want you
to do anything

226
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,039
that you're
uncomfortable with.

227
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,541
Good. Then
it's settled.

228
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,126
I'm going to go
take a sonic shower.

229
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,878
Take your time.

230
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,548
Dinner won't be ready
for another 15 minutes.

231
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,763
And so...

232
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,683
the battle begins.

233
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,778
Let me try.

234
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,740
No. You do not have
the necessary strength.

235
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,782
And your fingers
are too fat.

236
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:05,118
Look out.

237
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,412
Would you just...?

238
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,038
Wait.
I've got it!

239
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,164
Ow!

240
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,708
Quiet.

241
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,833
Ow!

242
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:13,876
Are you hurt?

243
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,755
(<i> whispers</i> ):
Yes, I'm hurt.

244
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,923
You just cut my finger
and made me hit my head!

245
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,425
It<i> was</i> an accident.

246
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,009
(<i> sighs</i> )

247
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,387
I still don't see how
getting a pin out of a bunk

248
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,472
is going to
help us escape.

249
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,098
If you would
stop interfering

250
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,182
and allow me
to remove the pin

251
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,434
I would show you.

252
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,978
Let me take a look
at your head.

253
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,480
No, thank you.

254
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:36,857
The last time you touched me

255
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,485
things got a little
out of control.

256
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:39,902
You are right
about that.

257
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,447
<i>I</i> was seduced<i> and</i> betrayed.

258
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,116
Seduced?
I seduced you.

259
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,701
At least we agree on that point.

260
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:47,786
What?!

261
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,164
<i>You</i> desired
a physical relationship with me

262
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,165
from the very start.

263
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,916
That much was obvious.

264
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,753
You have<i> the</i> biggest ego
of any man I've ever known.

265
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,171
Considering how many men
you have known

266
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,547
that is quite a statement.

267
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,923
Am I supposed to be embarrassed

268
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,092
because Jadzia had a few lovers
before you?

269
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,552
A few?

270
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,886
You're right.
It was more than a few.

271
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,013
It was dozens.

272
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,807
Hundreds. In fact,
I don't think

273
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:11,685
there's anyone aboard DS9
who wasn't her lover.

274
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,645
(<i> door opens</i> )

275
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,816
Let me take
this opportunity

276
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,651
to welcome you both
to Cardassia Prime.

277
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:20,735
I trust you're being

278
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,278
well-treated so far.

279
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,571
(<i> chuckles</i> )

280
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,616
I've been looking over
the information

281
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,744
you supplied to the Breen
during your interrogation

282
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,706
and the results
are a bit confusing

283
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,999
as mental probes so often are.

284
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:39,671
I was wondering if you wouldn't
mind sifting through the data

285
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,922
and clarifying
certain issues for us.

286
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,592
You can't be serious.

287
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,469
I'm always serious.

288
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,723
You see,
if you don't do as I ask

289
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,475
I'll have to hand you over
to Legate Damar

290
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,227
(<i> whispers</i> ):
and you know how ruthless

291
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,187
the Cardassians
can be.

292
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,939
"It is my duty to inform you

293
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,817
"that you will be turned over
to a Cardassian Tribunal

294
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,902
where you will be tried
as war criminals."

295
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,070
War criminals?

296
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,572
What are the charges?

297
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:06,989
That is not necessary
for you to know.

298
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,324
All you need to know

299
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,659
is that you will be
found guilty and executed.

300
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:12,829
However, if you should
decide to join us

301
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,790
in our search for a quick
end to this miserable war

302
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,083
your sentence
will be reduced

303
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,752
to life imprisonment.

304
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,294
If you want to end the war

305
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,589
why don't you convince
the Founders to surrender?

306
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:23,923
(<i> chuckles</i> )

307
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,342
You know, my dear

308
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:31,055
it would be such
a shame for you to die

309
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:34,058
without the good
Dr. Bashir knowing

310
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,685
how you felt about him.

311
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,689
Wait!

312
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,827
(<i> chuckling</i> )

313
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,287
(<i> laughing</i> )

314
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,748
(<i> laughter continues</i> )

315
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:59,709
Ah, overconfidence--

316
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,796
the hallmark of the Weyouns.

317
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:05,381
Maybe the Founders
should eliminate that

318
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,133
from your genetic recipe
next time.

319
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,345
They'll just make another copy
of him, you know.

320
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,097
You should have killed<i> me.</i>

321
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,515
There's only<i> one</i> Damar.

322
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,143
I will keep
that in mind.

323
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,812
I'm sure you will.

324
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,522
Consider his offer, Klingon.

325
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,982
You die in two days.

326
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,111
Pick that up, and let's go.

327
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,425
There you are.

328
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,260
(<i> both chuckling</i> )

329
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,597
Who are you?

330
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,935
What do you mean?

331
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:04,023
I mean, who are you,
Anjohl Tennan?

332
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,400
I want to know everything

333
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,903
about your family,
your childhood...

334
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,780
(<i> chuckles</i> )

335
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,239
It would bore you.

336
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,741
Not at all.

337
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,076
What might seem
trivial to you

338
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,579
matters a great deal
to me.

339
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,414
I need to know more

340
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:24,544
about this Guide
the Prophets have sent me...

341
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,129
this simple farmer.

342
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,589
Mm.

343
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,635
This man who shares my bed.

344
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,640
We are of Bajor.

345
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,851
We await the
Restoration.

346
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,644
I am ready.

347
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,437
I have met the Guide.

348
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,940
You need only
tell me what to do.

349
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,652
I give myself to the Prophets
in all things.

350
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,946
She does
not understand.

351
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,531
She is fearful.

352
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,950
SISKO ALIEN:
There is no other path.

353
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,786
She is the Chosen One.

354
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,914
She must
embrace us.

355
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,081
I will.

356
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,917
I swear it.

357
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,419
Give me a chance, please.

358
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,463
Give us your allegiance,
Kai Winn Adami.

359
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,383
Restore us to
our rightful place

360
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:14,301
in the Celestial Temple.

361
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:17,513
Reject the
false Prophets.

362
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,806
Walk<i> our</i> path

363
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,475
and embrace
your own destiny.

364
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,896
Feel our love...

365
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,982
the love...

366
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:30,068
of the Pah-wraiths.

367
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,200
No!

368
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,493
No!

369
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,959
What is it, Adami?

370
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,418
What's happened?

371
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,837
They... they came to me.

372
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,589
A vision.

373
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:54,592
Blessed be
the Prophets.

374
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:57,095
No. They<i> weren't</i> 
the Prophets.

375
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,597
They were...

376
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:00,890
They were what?

377
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,727
The Pah-wraiths.

378
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,354
Find Solbor.

379
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,189
Tell him to go to the shrine

380
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,817
and bring me the Orb.

381
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,360
I must bare my soul
to the Prophets

382
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,737
and beg their forgiveness.

383
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,322
Eminence, are you
sure that's wise?

384
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,364
What do the
Prophets...?

385
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,492
Go! Bring me the Orb!

386
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,486
Well, hello.

387
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,905
(<i> laughing</i> )

388
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,116
I'm glad to see
you find the death

389
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,160
of my predecessor
so amusing.

390
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,410
Oh, you misjudge me.

391
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,913
I miss him deeply.

392
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:09,042
Here. Let's drink
to Weyoun 7.

393
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,878
When will the
prisoners be executed?

394
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,754
When the trial is completed.

395
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,589
Legal protocol must be observed.

396
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,341
When?

397
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:21,303
The execution is scheduled for
tomorrow afternoon, 1400 hours.

398
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,889
Have they agreed to cooperate?

399
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,849
No.

400
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,643
Maybe you should talk
to Worf again.

401
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,187
(<i> laughing</i> )

402
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:33,816
Ah! Welcome to
our Command Center.

403
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,109
(<i> distorted voice</i> )

404
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:37,195
Of course.
Go right ahead.

405
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:38,863
(<i> distorted voice</i> )

406
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,537
(<i> distorted voice</i> )

407
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,623
(<i> distorted voice</i> )

408
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:50,750
Absolutely not.

409
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,959
That database
is classified.

410
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,419
What Legate Damar
means to say is

411
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,504
that our entire database
is open to you.

412
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,964
Feel free to examine
it at your leisure.

413
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,799
(<i> distorted voice</i> )

414
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,009
Surely you
don't mean that.

415
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,011
On the contrary,
I'm quite sincere.

416
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,221
They don't need
to know everything

417
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:04,346
about our
military operation

418
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,681
in order to help us.

419
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,809
The decision was made
by the Founder herself.

420
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,145
The Founder has also
decided that, from now on

421
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:14,148
your military recommendations
will be submitted to Thot Gor

422
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,274
and he will pass it
on to her.

423
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,568
I will<i> not!</i>

424
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,361
(<i> distorted voice</i> )

425
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:22,990
I trust

426
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,367
that was simply
an unguarded emotional outburst

427
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,204
so I will ignore it
<i>this</i> time.

428
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:33,417
Make plans to do exactly
as the Founder instructed

429
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,879
or you can schedule an execution
for yourself as well.

430
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,061
(<i> beeping</i> )

431
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:54,897
Ready.

432
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,401
(<i> grunting</i> )

433
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:14,208
Leave me!

434
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,251
Oh, shut up!

435
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:18,254
You never listen.

436
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,463
Look who's talking.

437
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,806
Do you have to do that?

438
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,766
I do it every
day at this time.

439
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,351
I know, but there's
something morbid about it.

440
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:34,812
Morbid?

441
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,730
That implies that
she's not coming back.

442
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,649
I wasn't implying
anything of the kind.

443
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,151
One of these days,
Ezri's going

444
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:42,486
to come walking through
those doors again

445
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,156
and this drink is going
to be sitting right here

446
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:46,406
waiting for her when she does.

447
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:47,741
Yeah, well

448
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,035
in the meantime,
all you're doing

449
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,870
is reminding us
that she's missing.

450
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,124
No one's forcing you
to sit here.

451
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,214
It was the Badlands.

452
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,424
What?

453
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:05,885
What?

454
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,095
You said something
about the Badlands.

455
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,848
Oh. Worf.

456
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,933
If his escape pod hadn't
drifted into the Badlands

457
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,852
the<i> Defiant</i> would have picked
him up and Ezri wouldn't

458
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,229
have had to go
looking for him.

459
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:19,023
Never thought I'd hear
myself saying this

460
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:22,609
but I wish the<i> Defiant</i> had found
that lumbering Klingon oaf.

461
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:25,403
Well, we can't do anything
to change what's happened.

462
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:28,032
We just have to hope
for the best.

463
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:30,117
Funny, I was just
starting to...

464
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:34,454
Starting to what?

465
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:37,833
I don't know.

466
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,003
But there was
something...

467
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,963
something about
her, wasn't there?

468
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,091
Something that made
me happy anyway.

469
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:49,845
She was this old soul
and yet so young at heart

470
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,847
and... and...

471
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,183
I don't know
what I'm saying.

472
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:56,560
Hmm.

473
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,158
Where is he?

474
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,743
DUKAT:
He'll be here any moment.

475
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:14,120
He said there were certain

476
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,747
security precautions
that had to be observed

477
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:19,333
before the Orb was allowed

478
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,876
to leave
the shrine.

479
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:24,630
May I ask
what you're planning?

480
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,881
No, you may not.

481
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:33,347
This is far beyond your ability
to comprehend, Anjohl.

482
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:34,974
(<i> door chimes</i> )

483
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:36,392
Come in.

484
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:42,148
The Orb of Prophecy.

485
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:44,024
Place it on
the table and...

486
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,067
and then go.

487
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,411
How may I serve you?

488
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,956
You are not required here.
Thank you.

489
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,925
There's nothing
to fear.

490
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:13,012
Of course not.
I'm the Kai.

491
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,931
The Prophets will make
everything clear to me.

492
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,158
Something's wrong.

493
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,659
What?

494
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,953
There's nothing.

495
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,458
The Prophets show me nothing.

496
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:45,294
They won't speak to me.

497
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:49,589
They have forsaken me...

498
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:55,304
...because I have been
in communion with the evil one.

499
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:56,889
Adami...

500
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:02,436
I know this may be
hard to hear, but...

501
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:04,980
you<i> must</i> listen.

502
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,902
I've hidden
something from you.

503
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:13,280
I didn't come here
by chance.

504
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,075
I had a vision.

505
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,952
The true Gods of Bajor
came to me

506
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,455
and asked me
to serve them.

507
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,623
The true Gods?

508
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,625
The Pah-wraiths.

509
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,086
They led me to you.

510
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,337
No!

511
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:29,713
They're not evil.
They care about Bajor.

512
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:30,797
No!

513
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,716
They want
to make Bajor strong.

514
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:33,759
Heretic.

515
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,136
Listen to me.

516
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,179
Get away!

517
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,056
Enough!

518
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:43,227
The Prophets have done
nothing for you.

519
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:45,645
During the occupation,
they turned their backs

520
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,356
and let our people suffer.

521
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,400
Let me go.

522
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,944
You've sacrificed
everything for them

523
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,196
and how have
they rewarded you?

524
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,614
They've appointed
an alien Emissary.

525
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:58,867
They've rejected you
at every turn.

526
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,619
Even now,
they won't speak to you.

527
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:02,620
Solbor!

528
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,081
Shh!

529
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:07,376
Listen to me,<i> please.</i>

530
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:10,879
The Pah-wraiths
will give you everything

531
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,965
you've ever dreamt of--

532
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,508
the power...

533
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:18,178
the adoration of the people.

534
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:23,309
In spite of your
protestations of humility

535
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:26,103
that's what you really want;
admit it.

536
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:29,982
Stop pretending to be
something you're not.

537
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:33,193
Take what they're
offering you.

538
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,827
Get out.

539
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,545
Go.

540
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:53,631
Crawl back
to your Prophets.

541
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:56,008
Beg their forgiveness.

542
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,969
Live the rest of your life...

543
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:01,221
in Sisko's shadow!

544
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:23,827
I'll do anything you ask.

545
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,704
You need only give the word.

546
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:35,422
Have you nothing to say to me?

547
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,885
Am I so offensive to your eyes

548
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:43,180
that I don't exist
for you anymore?

549
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:55,234
There must be something I can do
to prove to you

550
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:59,029
that I'm still worthy
of your love.

551
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,043
(<i> com beep</i> )

552
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,046
Go ahead.

553
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,131
This is Kai Winn.

554
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,217
I need to speak with you.

555
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:22,135
Would you come to my quarters?

556
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,389
Of course.

557
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,645
Colonel Kira to see you,
Eminence.

558
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:37,443
Come in, my child.

559
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:38,985
Please sit down.

560
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,362
Thank you

561
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,573
for seeing me
at such a late hour.

562
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,659
What can I do for you?

563
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:50,997
I have often sensed...

564
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:54,960
that you don't approve
of how I conduct myself as Kai--

565
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,170
that you believe

566
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,590
I put my own political interests

567
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,217
ahead of the spiritual
well-being of our people.

568
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,261
I wish
I could disagree

569
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:05,804
with that assessment.

570
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,685
I have strayed from the path

571
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:14,480
the Prophets
have laid down for me.

572
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,607
Eminence...

573
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:18,233
You don't know.

574
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,985
You<i> don't</i> know.

575
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,362
Eminence.

576
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,909
When you told me
that the Prophets

577
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,286
had spoken to you

578
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:32,623
I prayed that they
would open your heart

579
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:34,583
that they would
change you.

580
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:38,003
Oh, I want to change.

581
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:41,757
I would... I'd do anything
to earn their forgiveness

582
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,008
but I'm afraid it's too late.

583
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,093
It's never too late.

584
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:48,639
The<i> worst</i> of us
can be redeemed.

585
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:50,932
How?

586
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,393
Well, I-I'm
not a vedek...

587
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:57,397
but it seems to me that
you have to set aside

588
00:30:57,397 --> 00:31:00,150
the things that
led you astray--

589
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,194
ambition, jealousy.

590
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:07,157
Oh, yes. I have given in
to the temptations of power.

591
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:09,034
Turn away from temptation.

592
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,202
Yes.

593
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,871
Give yourself over
to the Prophets.

594
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,748
I'll do whatever it takes

595
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:16,792
to make myself worthy
in their eyes.

596
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:24,216
Everything will change
once you step down as Kai.

597
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:25,425
You'll see.

598
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,844
Step down?

599
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:29,680
I don't understand.

600
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,807
Why would I do that?

601
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,559
Bajor needs me.

602
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:36,895
E-Eminence...

603
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,856
being in power

604
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:40,816
is what led you
on the wrong path.

605
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:43,443
But I've resolved to change.

606
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,613
Don't you see?

607
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:53,746
Once I have regained
the Prophets' trust

608
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:57,416
I'll be better able
to serve them if I remain Kai.

609
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:02,087
If the Prophets wanted
me to step down

610
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,256
surely they would have
told me so.

611
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:09,762
They don't always use words
to make their wishes known.

612
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:14,182
Sometimes they speak to us
by touching our hearts

613
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:17,561
but... only you would know
if they had done that.

614
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:20,980
But Bajor needs me.

615
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,276
Good night, Eminence.

616
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:34,536
(<i> laughing</i> )

617
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,413
Yeah... Oh, Damar.

618
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,540
Oh, there you are.

619
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,959
I want you to hear this.

620
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,002
Thot Gor had an
interesting observation

621
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,338
regarding our forces
along the Romulan border.

622
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,132
In his view,
we have failed

623
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,508
to take advantage

624
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,385
of several weaknesses
in their defenses.

625
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,386
Is that so?

626
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,388
For instance

627
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,557
the Romulan colony
in the Unroth system

628
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,100
is ripe for attack.

629
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,519
Their long-range-sensor
array is being repaired...

630
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,771
Septimus III
has fallen.

631
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:01,772
Excuse me?

632
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:03,523
Septimus III.

633
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:07,527
An entire Cardassian Order has
been wiped out-- 500,000 men.

634
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,947
Oh, yes.
A great tragedy.

635
00:33:09,947 --> 00:33:11,364
You promised
reinforcements.

636
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,158
I promised nothing
of the kind.

637
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,327
I said the situation would be
dealt with, and it was.

638
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,496
By leaving them to be
slaughtered by the Klingons.

639
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,998
If you will calm down

640
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,501
and listen,
I will explain.

641
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:25,587
The sacrifice made
by the 11th Order

642
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,631
will not be in vain.

643
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,174
They forced the Klingons

644
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:33,178
to commit worthwhile,
valuable troops and resources

645
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:36,264
to capture a strategically
worthless planet.

646
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,182
(<i> distorted voice</i> )

647
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,224
I'm glad you agree.

648
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,810
Well, I don't.

649
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,687
You condemned a half a million
loyal Cardassians...

650
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:42,688
If they were

651
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:44,272
truly loyal Cardassians

652
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,024
then they died willingly
for the Dominion.

653
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,526
There could be
no greater sacrifice.

654
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:48,986
How many more
sacrifices

655
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:50,654
will my people be asked to make?

656
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,239
<i>Your</i> people, Damar?

657
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,997
We are all one
with the Dominion--

658
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:02,541
Vorta, Cardassian,
Jem'Hadar, the Breen.

659
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,334
(<i> distorted voice</i> )

660
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:07,921
We<i> all</i> serve the Founders,
and we will<i> all</i> make

661
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:11,508
whatever sacrifices
they deem necessary.

662
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:13,010
Thot Gor, would you mind

663
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:15,053
reiterating your plan
for the Unroth system?

664
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,890
I seem to have lost
my train of thought.

665
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,392
(<i> distorted voice</i> )

666
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,187
(<i> distorted voice</i> )

667
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,064
Yes, I know.

668
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,983
It's become increasingly
difficult to get

669
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:29,526
a full day's work
out of him.

670
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:32,237
(<i> distorted voice</i> )

671
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:10,400
The Dax symbiont has lived
for over 300 years

672
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,945
experienced eight lifetimes

673
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:15,154
and now it's all going to end

674
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:17,991
with an execution
on Cardassia.

675
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:20,953
Ezri Tigan's contribution
to the Dax legacy

676
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:23,204
will be to end it.

677
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:29,962
There is no honor
in self-pity.

678
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:35,508
You know, Worf,
I have had just about enough

679
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:38,261
of your little
Klingon aphorisms.

680
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,305
The only reason
I came on this mission

681
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,890
was to save
your miserable life.

682
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,391
So the least you could do

683
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:46,144
is stop acting like
such a self-righteous<i> targ.</i>

684
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,606
Your motives for rescuing
me are not honorable.

685
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:54,111
Do you really think that I would
disobey orders and risk my life

686
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:56,195
so that I could seduce you?

687
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:59,240
I hate to burst your bubble,
Worf, but it wasn't that good.

688
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,160
Always the barb.

689
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,745
Always the joke.

690
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:06,081
There was a time when you found
my sense of humor

691
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:08,333
to be one
of my more endearing qualities.

692
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:11,252
That was Jadzia, not you.

693
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:14,506
Are you angry at me
for something that<i> I</i> did

694
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,758
or because I'm not Jadzia?

695
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:24,307
Let's cut right to the heart
of the matter.

696
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,809
Do you love me?

697
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,435
Me, Ezri?

698
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,480
You are trying to turn this
around and make it about me.

699
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,481
Answer the question.

700
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:32,732
Do you love me?

701
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,151
I have made my
feelings clear

702
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:35,694
back on Goralis III.

703
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:40,824
What is it, Worf?

704
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:43,660
Could it be
that you're feeling...

705
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,830
just a little guilty
because you don't have

706
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,999
the same feelings for me
that you did for Jadzia?

707
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,086
If that's true...

708
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:57,007
then maybe we both made
a mistake back on Goralis.

709
00:36:57,007 --> 00:37:00,510
So maybe we both
should be forgiven.

710
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,643
This night would be better spent

711
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,520
preparing ourselves
for the next life

712
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,689
instead of rehashing
the mistakes of this one.

713
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,594
You<i> are</i> right.

714
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,224
What?

715
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,727
I said you are right.

716
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:55,273
I do not love you
as I loved Jadzia.

717
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:06,325
There's no crime in that.

718
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,661
Oh, I dishonored myself.

719
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:12,331
I know how often
I use that word

720
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,417
maybe too often,
but in this case

721
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,128
it is appropriate.

722
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:17,921
Go on.

723
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:19,839
From the first moment
you came on the station

724
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,008
I knew you were not Jadzia

725
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:25,178
and yet... I knew there was
a part of Jadzia

726
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,139
still alive within you.

727
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,725
On Goralis...

728
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,812
I... allowed myself
to see<i> her</i>

729
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,396
instead of you.

730
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,316
I felt the same way.

731
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,861
Part of me...

732
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,905
the part that was your wife...

733
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,991
wanted very much
to be close to you.

734
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,328
I realize
Jadzia saw physical love

735
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,080
differently than I do.

736
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,083
To her, it could mean
many things

737
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,919
but to me,
it was a deeply spiritual act.

738
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,714
When I made love to you...

739
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,843
my motives were not spiritual.

740
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:08,221
It was an unworthy impulse.

741
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:12,309
Worf, we're not Gods
or Prophets.

742
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:13,893
We're people.

743
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,812
We make mistakes.

744
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:23,069
There is one other thing
I want you to know.

745
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:28,158
I honestly didn't realize
how I felt about Julian.

746
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:30,409
I would've never hidden
something like that

747
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,410
from you.

748
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,121
I believe you...

749
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:36,875
and I do not hold any malice
toward you or Dr. Bashir.

750
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,417
That's good to know.

751
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:43,840
Friends?

752
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:47,760
And more.

753
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,387
And more.

754
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,686
It appears all we
have left to do is

755
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:58,230
to be executed.

756
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,274
Sounds like a lazy day to me.

757
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:02,984
(<i> door opening</i> )

758
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,154
It's time.

759
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,294
(<i> groaning</i> )

760
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:27,466
There's a Cardassian
patrol ship sitting

761
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,344
in Launch Bay 3-A,
two levels above us.

762
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,554
Its computers have all
the necessary information

763
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,306
to get you past
our security
checkpoints.

764
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:35,433
Why are you doing this?

765
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,019
I want you to give a
message to the Federation.

766
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,772
Tell them they have
an ally on Cardassia.

767
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,232
Why should we trust you?

768
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:44,109
You can either
trust me...

769
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:46,319
or you can stay here
and be executed.

770
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,031
I vote for option one.

771
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,335
(<i> distorted voice</i> )

772
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:03,420
Escaped?!

773
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,837
How could this
have happened?

774
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,714
You're the one that
put the Jem'Hadar

775
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,133
in charge of the
detention area.

776
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:10,176
Thank you
for reminding me.

777
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,219
(<i> distorted voice</i> )

778
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:12,678
No, I assure you

779
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,389
this is not typical
of our security procedures.

780
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:16,308
(<i> beeping</i> )

781
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:17,475
The Founder...

782
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,811
she wishes to see me.

783
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:21,229
She has to be told about this.

784
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,022
Oh, I'm sure she'll understand

785
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,441
but, if she doesn't...

786
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:27,319
I look forward
to meeting Weyoun 9.

787
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,574
(<i> chuckles</i> )

788
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,957
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

789
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:43,126
SOLBOR:
Eminence...

790
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:44,294
Anjohl is here.

791
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:47,505
He claims you
called for him.

792
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,175
Show him in.

793
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:52,427
As you wish.

794
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,480
I remember
when I first saw the gate

795
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,357
of the Celestial Temple.

796
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:07,859
I was on the Promenade.

797
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,903
When it burst into view, this...

798
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,865
whirlpool of color and light

799
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:16,284
the people all around me
were in awe.

800
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:17,827
They said they
could feel the love

801
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:20,455
of the Prophets
washing over them.

802
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,881
Do you know what I felt, Anjohl?

803
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,384
Nothing.

804
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:34,927
Absolutely nothing...

805
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,472
but I smiled
and pretended

806
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:40,933
I did, because it was
expected of me.

807
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:45,771
I've never admitted that
to anyone.

808
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,982
I can understand why.

809
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:51,152
They've never spoken to me...

810
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:54,113
never offered me guidance...

811
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:57,033
never trusted me
with the fruits of their wisdom

812
00:42:57,033 --> 00:43:01,371
and now, I'm supposed
to step down as Kai

813
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:03,206
in order to be blessed by them.

814
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:06,376
No.

815
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:09,462
I have worked too hard,
waited too long

816
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:11,214
to give it all up now.

817
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:13,049
You shouldn't have to.

818
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:17,887
Merciful Gods
don't ask their children

819
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,972
to make such sacrifices.

820
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,016
The Prophets
have turned

821
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,727
their backs on me--
after all I've done for them

822
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,979
all the pain I've endured
for them.

823
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:29,648
They're not worthy of you,
Adami.

824
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:32,860
I'm a patient woman...

825
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,738
but I have run out of patience.

826
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:40,076
I will no longer serve Gods
who give me nothing in return.

827
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:43,037
I'm ready to walk the path

828
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:45,748
the Pah-wraiths
have laid out for me.

829
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,917
I'll walk with you...

830
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,837
and<i> no one...</i>

831
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:55,841
will be able
to stand against us.

832
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,760
Those who<i> dare</i> to try--

833
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,013
the Federation and
its Vedek puppets,

834
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:05,810
the false Gods and their
precious Emissary--

835
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:08,271
they'll all be swept aside

836
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:11,524
like dead leaves
before an angry wind.
