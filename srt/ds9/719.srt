1
00:00:02,263 --> 00:00:04,096
Last time on
<i>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...</i>

2
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:05,362
This is intolerable.

3
00:00:05,402 --> 00:00:07,599
They have us caged
up like animals.

4
00:00:13,018 --> 00:00:14,612
Stop it!

5
00:00:21,401 --> 00:00:23,200
We meet at last.

6
00:00:24,473 --> 00:00:26,136
Gifts?

7
00:00:26,177 --> 00:00:27,806
How thoughtful.

8
00:00:27,847 --> 00:00:30,648
You should be honored.

9
00:00:30,687 --> 00:00:33,523
You're witnessing
an historic moment...

10
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:35,119
the birth of the alliance

11
00:00:35,162 --> 00:00:38,657
between the Dominion
and the Breen.

12
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:41,003
And now the continuation.

13
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:45,405
We will secure
the prisoners below.

14
00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:47,043
They will share a cell.

15
00:00:47,086 --> 00:00:48,384
They may wish to...

16
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:51,952
physically comfort each other
on the long trip back

17
00:00:51,995 --> 00:00:53,897
to Cardassia.

18
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:56,028
I find interspecies

19
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,370
mating rituals
fascinating to watch.

20
00:01:09,196 --> 00:01:10,893
Interesting device.

21
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:12,424
Oh, I am so sorry.

22
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:14,234
Where are my manners?

23
00:01:14,273 --> 00:01:16,140
Allow me to introduce
Legate Damar

24
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:17,908
leader of the
Cardassian Union.

25
00:01:17,947 --> 00:01:18,915
Thot Gor.

26
00:01:18,949 --> 00:01:20,008
Thot.

27
00:01:20,051 --> 00:01:22,955
That's the equivalent
of a Legate, isn't it?

28
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,157
What did he say?

29
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:28,690
He says, "You need to have

30
00:01:28,736 --> 00:01:30,865
your universal
translator adjusted."

31
00:01:30,907 --> 00:01:32,034
I would have if I'd known

32
00:01:32,075 --> 00:01:33,543
we were meeting
with the Breen.

33
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,255
It is a distinct pleasure
to finally meet you.

34
00:01:59,597 --> 00:02:00,758
Thank you.

35
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,465
If our face-to-face talks
are as productive

36
00:02:03,505 --> 00:02:05,668
as our subspace
communications

37
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,944
have been, I'm sure we'll
sign the treaty documents

38
00:02:08,983 --> 00:02:10,281
within a few days.

39
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,809
I haven't even seen
this treaty.

40
00:02:11,855 --> 00:02:13,050
We'll discuss it later.

41
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,754
The alliance between
the Breen Confederacy

42
00:02:14,794 --> 00:02:17,595
and the Dominion will end
this destructive war

43
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:19,899
that has torn this
Quadrant apart.

44
00:02:19,938 --> 00:02:21,567
With the Breen at our side

45
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:24,773
the Federation will not be able
to stand against us.

46
00:02:24,814 --> 00:02:28,014
They'll be erased
from the face of the galaxy.

47
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,253
This is outrageous.

48
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:36,262
Have you read this treaty?

49
00:04:36,296 --> 00:04:37,423
Parts of it.

50
00:04:37,465 --> 00:04:39,196
There's a reference
to territorial concessions

51
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:41,000
that the Cardassians
are to make to the Breen

52
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:43,202
but it doesn't say what
those concessions are.

53
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:44,906
Oh, you needn't worry
about that.

54
00:04:44,947 --> 00:04:48,147
It's all been itemized
in a secret protocol

55
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:49,952
between the Dominion
and the Breen.

56
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,087
All that is required of you
is to sign the document

57
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,364
as the acknowledged leader
of the Cardassian Union.

58
00:04:56,403 --> 00:04:57,666
I want to see this protocol.

59
00:04:57,705 --> 00:05:00,141
Then it wouldn't be much
of a secret then, would it?

60
00:05:00,177 --> 00:05:02,272
You expect me to agree
to territorial concessions

61
00:05:02,315 --> 00:05:03,978
when I haven't even seen
what they are?

62
00:05:04,018 --> 00:05:07,252
Damar, you are missing
the point.

63
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:11,254
We need the Breen
to win this war.

64
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:12,733
When it's over

65
00:05:12,768 --> 00:05:15,797
there will be more than enough
territories available

66
00:05:15,842 --> 00:05:19,839
to compensate Cardassia for
the loss of a few minor planets.

67
00:05:19,883 --> 00:05:22,446
There are no minor planets
in the Cardassian Union.

68
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:25,892
Do you know what I think
you should do?

69
00:05:25,929 --> 00:05:27,295
Talk to Thot Gor.

70
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:28,799
Express your concerns.

71
00:05:28,835 --> 00:05:29,803
He's very reasonable

72
00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:31,397
and quite personable
when you get to know him.

73
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,805
I don't trust him
or his people.

74
00:05:33,845 --> 00:05:35,177
The Founders should
never have agreed

75
00:05:35,214 --> 00:05:37,548
to give away Cardassian
territory without my consent.

76
00:05:37,585 --> 00:05:38,883
I'm sorry.

77
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,891
I think I misunderstood you.

78
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:43,395
It sounded
as if you were implying

79
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,425
that Cardassian territory
doesn't belong to the Founders.

80
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:48,234
Surely, that isn't
what you meant.

81
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:53,710
No, of course not.

82
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,150
Oh, good.

83
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:58,820
I look forward to receiving
the signed documents from you

84
00:05:58,861 --> 00:06:00,352
within the hour.

85
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:06,508
Is there something else?

86
00:06:06,543 --> 00:06:09,674
The Klingons have attacked
Septimus III.

87
00:06:09,716 --> 00:06:11,242
I'm aware of that.

88
00:06:11,286 --> 00:06:13,779
Are you also aware that
they've landed 15 divisions?

89
00:06:13,824 --> 00:06:14,849
The Cardassian troops

90
00:06:14,893 --> 00:06:16,829
will never survive
without reinforcements.

91
00:06:16,863 --> 00:06:18,229
I assure you

92
00:06:18,266 --> 00:06:21,602
the Septimus III situation
will be dealt with.

93
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,308
We will not allow your brave
soldiers to perish in vain.

94
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:27,959
You have my word.

95
00:06:38,146 --> 00:06:40,777
Septimus III will fall
within the week.

96
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,880
Huh! The Cardassian 11th Order.

97
00:06:43,924 --> 00:06:47,021
It's a reserve unit...
old men and walking wounded.

98
00:06:47,064 --> 00:06:48,761
They don't stand a chance.

99
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,497
I think
you're right.

100
00:06:50,537 --> 00:06:53,100
But enough about the war
with the Dominion.

101
00:06:53,142 --> 00:06:55,237
I want to hear
about the war at home.

102
00:06:55,313 --> 00:07:00,085
You just married that...
freighter captain, didn't you?

103
00:07:00,123 --> 00:07:01,614
Yes.

104
00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:04,825
Then war has broken out,
whether you know it or not...

105
00:07:04,865 --> 00:07:09,864
a long, grueling,
intoxicating war.

106
00:07:09,908 --> 00:07:11,707
I remember the day

107
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:14,512
my beloved Sirella moved
into my home.

108
00:07:16,188 --> 00:07:19,217
I had a pet <i>targ,</i>
had him since I was a boy...

109
00:07:19,328 --> 00:07:21,891
a filthy, mangy beast

110
00:07:21,932 --> 00:07:26,236
but in his bony breast
beat the heart of a warrior.

111
00:07:26,342 --> 00:07:29,246
Of course,
Sirella loathed him.

112
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:31,513
Well, to make
a long story short

113
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:35,151
while she was supervising
the unloading of her bags

114
00:07:35,193 --> 00:07:40,363
Sirella accidentally left
the front door open

115
00:07:40,403 --> 00:07:45,107
and my faithful <i>targ,</i> ever-ready
to follow the call of the wild

116
00:07:45,146 --> 00:07:47,048
tottered outside
on his frail legs

117
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,919
and disappeared
into the forest.

118
00:07:51,425 --> 00:07:54,397
I never laid eyes on him again.

119
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:57,528
Lady Sirella draws
the first blood.

120
00:07:59,608 --> 00:08:01,805
You see my point.

121
00:08:01,845 --> 00:08:04,213
Don't get me wrong.

122
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:08,852
I would not trade Sirella
for all the <i>targs</i> on <i>Qo'noS</i>

123
00:08:08,893 --> 00:08:11,592
and, over the course
of our marriage

124
00:08:11,632 --> 00:08:14,195
I've won more than my fair share
of battles between us

125
00:08:14,238 --> 00:08:15,867
but in the end...

126
00:08:15,907 --> 00:08:17,877
I know...

127
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:21,646
she will win the war.

128
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:25,257
I'll keep that in mind.

129
00:08:26,762 --> 00:08:28,994
You ate all the milaberries.

130
00:08:30,436 --> 00:08:35,401
Mm. Well, then have
Solbor bring us more.

131
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,173
And give him
another chance

132
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:39,687
to frown disapprovingly?

133
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,220
The good Ranjen doesn't
much care for me, does he?

134
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:47,293
You'd think he'd be pleased

135
00:08:47,337 --> 00:08:49,170
to see his Kai so happy.

136
00:08:51,445 --> 00:08:53,142
Are you happy, Adami?

137
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:55,779
More than I've ever
been in my life.

138
00:08:57,691 --> 00:08:59,957
The Prophets are smiling on us.

139
00:08:59,995 --> 00:09:00,963
Hmm.

140
00:09:00,997 --> 00:09:02,591
They've not only
brought us together

141
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:05,299
but they've given us
a great task...

142
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,176
the Restoration of Bajor.

143
00:09:08,212 --> 00:09:14,123
Our world will be reborn,
and you will be its leader.

144
00:09:14,157 --> 00:09:16,184
A sacred responsibility.

145
00:09:16,228 --> 00:09:17,857
Yes.

146
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:27,113
I pray that I'll have
the strength to do

147
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,450
what the Prophets
are asking of me.

148
00:09:34,498 --> 00:09:36,058
I will be at your side.

149
00:09:36,101 --> 00:09:37,661
We won't fail them.

150
00:09:39,508 --> 00:09:41,068
But the Restoration

151
00:09:41,111 --> 00:09:43,604
will not come
without struggle.

152
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,117
There will be those

153
00:09:45,153 --> 00:09:47,123
who will stand in our way.

154
00:09:47,157 --> 00:09:49,218
It is not allowed to interfere

155
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:51,356
with the will
of the Prophets.

156
00:09:51,398 --> 00:09:56,363
Even those who claim
to speak in their name.

157
00:09:56,408 --> 00:09:58,401
The Emissary.

158
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:02,283
Mm. In your vision...

159
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,588
the Prophets said
he'd faltered.

160
00:10:07,564 --> 00:10:09,864
I can only hope

161
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:13,032
that he doesn't choose
to oppose them.

162
00:10:13,074 --> 00:10:15,442
Their love is strong...

163
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,973
but so is their wrath.

164
00:10:29,374 --> 00:10:31,469
I hate to say it

165
00:10:31,512 --> 00:10:33,744
but this is doing wonders
for my back.

166
00:10:33,782 --> 00:10:36,583
I doubt that is what
our captors had in mind.

167
00:10:36,622 --> 00:10:37,851
Probably not.

168
00:10:37,891 --> 00:10:39,884
We must get back
to the station

169
00:10:39,928 --> 00:10:41,488
and warn Starfleet
about the Breen.

170
00:10:41,565 --> 00:10:42,863
You're right.

171
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:45,668
There's just a few problems.

172
00:10:45,706 --> 00:10:47,608
We're on a Jem'Hadar ship

173
00:10:47,644 --> 00:10:49,876
heading
in the wrong direction

174
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:54,117
hanging upside down,
and...

175
00:10:54,157 --> 00:10:55,820
And what?

176
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,162
I'm think I'm getting spacesick.

177
00:11:14,364 --> 00:11:17,929
Well, welcome home,
Mrs. Sisko.

178
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:19,964
Well, thank you, Mr. Sisko.

179
00:11:21,345 --> 00:11:22,506
Mmm.

180
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,777
So, how was your cargo run?

181
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:26,081
Interesting.

182
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,522
It seems
my Bajoran crew members

183
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,085
have decided that serving

184
00:11:30,128 --> 00:11:32,257
under the wife of the Emissary

185
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,031
is a little different
than serving

186
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:35,766
under his girlfriend.

187
00:11:35,806 --> 00:11:39,040
I've known some of those people
for ten years or more

188
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:41,778
and suddenly,
they're asking me for advice

189
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:44,790
about their children,
their wives, their husbands

190
00:11:44,824 --> 00:11:47,489
their spiritual relationship
with the Prophets.

191
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,363
Welcome to the club.

192
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:51,200
Which reminds me...

193
00:11:51,238 --> 00:11:54,233
every spring, the Emissary
holds a little ceremony

194
00:11:54,277 --> 00:11:56,713
to bless the women on the
station who want to be mothers.

195
00:11:56,748 --> 00:11:59,150
What does this have
to do with me?

196
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:02,647
There's been a request made...
several, in fact...

197
00:12:02,694 --> 00:12:04,425
that the new wife

198
00:12:04,464 --> 00:12:07,698
of the Emissary perform
the ceremony this year...

199
00:12:07,737 --> 00:12:09,035
this week, actually.

200
00:12:09,073 --> 00:12:11,236
No.

201
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:13,214
Kasidy...

202
00:12:13,248 --> 00:12:15,013
No. I've got

203
00:12:15,051 --> 00:12:16,850
to draw the
line somewhere.

204
00:12:16,888 --> 00:12:18,551
I married you,
I didn't convert.

205
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,650
And I'm not going to start...

206
00:12:19,694 --> 00:12:22,791
acting like I suddenly
believe in the Prophets.

207
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:24,302
I wouldn't want you
to do anything

208
00:12:24,337 --> 00:12:25,931
that you're
uncomfortable with.

209
00:12:25,973 --> 00:12:27,373
Good. Then it's settled.

210
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:30,041
I'm going to go
take a sonic shower.

211
00:12:30,081 --> 00:12:31,710
Take your time.

212
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,485
Dinner won't be ready
for another 15 minutes.

213
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,531
And so...

214
00:12:42,573 --> 00:12:44,440
the battle begins.

215
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,391
Let me try.

216
00:12:57,436 --> 00:12:59,599
No. You do not have
the necessary strength.

217
00:12:59,641 --> 00:13:01,577
And your fingers
are too fat.

218
00:13:01,611 --> 00:13:02,943
Look out.

219
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,280
Would you just?

220
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:06,879
Wait. I've got it!

221
00:13:06,922 --> 00:13:08,151
Ow!

222
00:13:08,191 --> 00:13:09,489
Quiet.

223
00:13:09,527 --> 00:13:10,586
Ow!

224
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:11,688
Are you hurt?

225
00:13:13,535 --> 00:13:14,594
Yes, I'm hurt.

226
00:13:14,671 --> 00:13:16,698
You just cut my finger
and made me hit my head!

227
00:13:16,741 --> 00:13:18,301
It was an accident.

228
00:13:19,981 --> 00:13:22,110
I still don't see how
getting a pin out of a bunk

229
00:13:22,152 --> 00:13:23,313
is going to
help us escape.

230
00:13:23,355 --> 00:13:24,915
If you would
stop interfering

231
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,153
and allow me
to remove the pin

232
00:13:26,193 --> 00:13:27,252
I would show you.

233
00:13:27,295 --> 00:13:29,788
Let me take a look
at your head.

234
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:31,268
No, thank you.

235
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:34,738
The last time you touched me

236
00:13:34,777 --> 00:13:36,542
things got a little
out of control.

237
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:37,776
You are right about that.

238
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,345
I was seduced and betrayed.

239
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:42,917
Seduced? I seduced you.

240
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,589
At least we agree on that point.

241
00:13:44,631 --> 00:13:45,621
What?!

242
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,196
You desired
a physical relationship with me

243
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:50,207
from the very start.

244
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:51,675
That much was obvious.

245
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:54,648
You have the biggest ego
of any man I've ever known.

246
00:13:54,684 --> 00:13:56,244
Considering how many men
you have known

247
00:13:56,287 --> 00:13:57,414
that is quite a statement.

248
00:13:57,456 --> 00:13:58,685
Am I supposed to be embarrassed

249
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:00,989
because Jadzia had a few lovers
before you?

250
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,498
A few?

251
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:03,899
You're right.
It was more than a few.

252
00:14:03,936 --> 00:14:04,961
It was dozens.

253
00:14:05,004 --> 00:14:06,657
Hundreds. In fact,
I don't think

254
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,387
there's anyone aboard DS9
who wasn't her lover.

255
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:15,540
Let me take this opportunity

256
00:14:15,575 --> 00:14:17,442
to welcome you both
to Cardassia Prime.

257
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:18,447
I trust you're being

258
00:14:18,481 --> 00:14:20,246
well-treated so far.

259
00:14:21,352 --> 00:14:24,153
I've been looking over
the information

260
00:14:24,191 --> 00:14:27,459
you supplied to the Breen
during your interrogation

261
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:30,369
and the results
are a bit confusing

262
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:32,772
as mental probes so often are.

263
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:37,444
I was wondering if you wouldn't
mind sifting through the data

264
00:14:37,485 --> 00:14:39,614
and clarifying
certain issues for us.

265
00:14:39,656 --> 00:14:42,321
You can't be serious.

266
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:44,194
I'm always serious.

267
00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:47,294
You see,
if you don't do as I ask

268
00:14:47,337 --> 00:14:50,036
I'll have to hand you over
to Legate Damar

269
00:14:50,076 --> 00:14:52,046
and you know how ruthless

270
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,050
the Cardassians can be.

271
00:14:54,084 --> 00:14:56,384
"It is my duty to inform you

272
00:14:56,423 --> 00:14:58,518
"that you will be turned over
to a Cardassian Tribunal

273
00:14:58,561 --> 00:15:00,656
where you will be tried
as war criminals."

274
00:15:00,698 --> 00:15:01,757
War criminals?

275
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,326
What are the charges?

276
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,860
That is not necessary
for you to know.

277
00:15:04,906 --> 00:15:05,874
All you need to know

278
00:15:05,908 --> 00:15:07,434
is that you will be
found guilty and executed.

279
00:15:07,478 --> 00:15:10,450
However, if you should
decide to join us

280
00:15:10,484 --> 00:15:13,581
in our search for a quick
end to this miserable war

281
00:15:13,624 --> 00:15:14,990
your sentence
will be reduced

282
00:15:15,026 --> 00:15:16,494
to life imprisonment.

283
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,828
If you want to end the war

284
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:20,268
why don't you convince
the Founders to surrender?

285
00:15:21,907 --> 00:15:23,934
You know, my dear

286
00:15:23,978 --> 00:15:28,886
it would be such
a shame for you to die

287
00:15:28,921 --> 00:15:31,791
without the good
Dr. Bashir knowing

288
00:15:31,827 --> 00:15:33,353
how you felt about him.

289
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:36,929
Wait!

290
00:15:54,606 --> 00:15:57,476
Ah, overconfidence...

291
00:15:57,512 --> 00:16:00,712
the hallmark of the Weyouns.

292
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,983
Maybe the Founders
should eliminate that

293
00:16:03,022 --> 00:16:05,049
from your genetic recipe
next time.

294
00:16:06,663 --> 00:16:08,929
They'll just make another copy
of him, you know.

295
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,870
You should have killed me.

296
00:16:10,905 --> 00:16:12,373
There's only one Damar.

297
00:16:12,407 --> 00:16:14,935
I will keep that in mind.

298
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,540
I'm sure you will.

299
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,282
Consider his offer, Klingon.

300
00:16:19,321 --> 00:16:20,915
You die in two days.

301
00:16:23,162 --> 00:16:25,064
Pick that up, and let's go.

302
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:47,272
There you are.

303
00:16:50,818 --> 00:16:52,344
Who are you?

304
00:16:55,661 --> 00:16:56,890
What do you mean?

305
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:01,798
I mean, who are you,
Anjohl Tennan?

306
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,276
I want to know everything

307
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:06,908
about your family,
your childhood...

308
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:10,054
It would bore you.

309
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,581
Not at all.

310
00:17:11,626 --> 00:17:13,926
What might seem trivial to you

311
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:16,366
matters a great deal to me.

312
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,304
I need to know more

313
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:22,541
about this Guide
the Prophets have sent me...

314
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,179
this simple farmer.

315
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,586
Mm.

316
00:17:27,658 --> 00:17:30,630
This man who shares my bed.

317
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:35,501
We are of Bajor.

318
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,635
We await the Restoration.

319
00:17:37,745 --> 00:17:39,510
I am ready.

320
00:17:39,548 --> 00:17:41,177
I have met the Guide.

321
00:17:41,218 --> 00:17:43,849
You need only
tell me what to do.

322
00:17:43,891 --> 00:17:47,524
I give myself to the Prophets
in all things.

323
00:17:47,564 --> 00:17:49,830
She does not understand.

324
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,201
She is fearful.

325
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:53,801
There is no other path.

326
00:17:53,844 --> 00:17:56,680
She is the Chosen One.

327
00:17:56,783 --> 00:17:58,946
She must embrace us.

328
00:17:58,987 --> 00:18:00,182
I will.

329
00:18:00,223 --> 00:18:01,783
I swear it.

330
00:18:01,826 --> 00:18:04,354
Give me a chance, please.

331
00:18:04,398 --> 00:18:07,427
Give us your allegiance,
Kai Winn Adami.

332
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,237
Restore us to
our rightful place

333
00:18:10,276 --> 00:18:12,269
in the Celestial Temple.

334
00:18:12,314 --> 00:18:15,411
Reject the false Prophets.

335
00:18:15,453 --> 00:18:16,785
Walk our path

336
00:18:16,823 --> 00:18:19,316
and embrace your own destiny.

337
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,958
Feel our love...

338
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,101
the love...

339
00:18:26,141 --> 00:18:28,134
of the Pah-wraiths.

340
00:18:35,026 --> 00:18:35,994
No!

341
00:18:36,028 --> 00:18:37,360
No!

342
00:18:41,472 --> 00:18:43,908
What is it, Adami?

343
00:18:43,944 --> 00:18:45,310
What's happened?

344
00:18:45,346 --> 00:18:47,943
They... they came to me.

345
00:18:47,985 --> 00:18:49,614
A vision.

346
00:18:49,656 --> 00:18:52,560
Blessed be the Prophets.

347
00:18:52,594 --> 00:18:55,030
No. They weren't the Prophets.

348
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:57,536
They were...

349
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,970
They were what?

350
00:19:01,378 --> 00:19:02,846
The Pah-wraiths.

351
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,315
Find Solbor.

352
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,118
Tell him to go to the shrine

353
00:19:07,157 --> 00:19:08,786
and bring me the Orb.

354
00:19:08,827 --> 00:19:11,093
I must bare my soul
to the Prophets

355
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:12,828
and beg their forgiveness.

356
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:14,302
Eminence, are you
sure that's wise?

357
00:19:14,338 --> 00:19:15,306
What do the Prophets?

358
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,606
Go! Bring me the Orb!

359
00:19:50,343 --> 00:19:52,040
Well, hello.

360
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:56,785
I'm glad to see
you find the death

361
00:19:56,823 --> 00:19:58,725
of my predecessor
so amusing.

362
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,160
Oh, you misjudge me.

363
00:20:00,196 --> 00:20:02,325
I miss him deeply.

364
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,533
Here. Let's drink to Weyoun 7.

365
00:20:05,573 --> 00:20:08,568
When will the
prisoners be executed?

366
00:20:08,612 --> 00:20:10,411
When the trial is completed.

367
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,750
Legal protocol must be observed.

368
00:20:12,788 --> 00:20:14,086
When?

369
00:20:14,124 --> 00:20:17,996
The execution is scheduled for
tomorrow afternoon, 1400 hours.

370
00:20:18,032 --> 00:20:19,592
Have they agreed to cooperate?

371
00:20:19,634 --> 00:20:21,433
No.

372
00:20:21,472 --> 00:20:24,308
Maybe you should talk
to Worf again.

373
00:20:26,014 --> 00:20:30,512
Ah! Welcome to
our Command Center.

374
00:20:31,926 --> 00:20:33,862
Of course. Go right ahead.

375
00:20:46,388 --> 00:20:47,356
Absolutely not.

376
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,483
That database
is classified.

377
00:20:48,526 --> 00:20:50,155
What Legate Damar
means to say is

378
00:20:50,196 --> 00:20:52,223
that our entire database
is open to you.

379
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:53,667
Feel free to examine
it at your leisure.

380
00:20:55,606 --> 00:20:56,733
Surely you don't mean that.

381
00:20:56,776 --> 00:20:58,871
On the contrary,
I'm quite sincere.

382
00:20:58,914 --> 00:21:00,041
They don't need
to know everything

383
00:21:00,082 --> 00:21:01,050
about our
military operation

384
00:21:01,084 --> 00:21:02,052
in order to help us.

385
00:21:02,086 --> 00:21:05,354
The decision was made
by the Founder herself.

386
00:21:05,393 --> 00:21:07,693
The Founder has also
decided that, from now on

387
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:10,861
your military recommendations
will be submitted to Thot Gor

388
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:12,236
and he will pass it
on to her.

389
00:21:12,273 --> 00:21:14,300
I will not!

390
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:19,748
I trust

391
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:22,191
that was simply
an unguarded emotional outburst

392
00:21:22,226 --> 00:21:24,993
so I will ignore it this time.

393
00:21:25,032 --> 00:21:30,236
Make plans to do exactly
as the Founder instructed

394
00:21:30,276 --> 00:21:33,578
or you can schedule an execution
for yourself as well.

395
00:21:50,683 --> 00:21:51,844
Ready.

396
00:22:09,816 --> 00:22:10,749
Leave me!

397
00:22:10,853 --> 00:22:11,843
Oh, shut up!

398
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:14,927
You never listen.

399
00:22:14,961 --> 00:22:16,259
Look who's talking.

400
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:25,544
Do you have to do that?

401
00:22:25,581 --> 00:22:27,244
I do it every
day at this time.

402
00:22:27,285 --> 00:22:30,348
I know, but there's
something morbid about it.

403
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:31,381
Morbid?

404
00:22:31,427 --> 00:22:33,226
That implies that
she's not coming back.

405
00:22:33,264 --> 00:22:35,234
I wasn't implying
anything of the kind.

406
00:22:35,268 --> 00:22:36,897
One of these days,
Ezri's going

407
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,135
to come walking through
those doors again

408
00:22:39,176 --> 00:22:41,807
and this drink is going
to be sitting right here

409
00:22:41,847 --> 00:22:43,247
waiting for her when she does.

410
00:22:43,284 --> 00:22:44,252
Yeah, well

411
00:22:44,286 --> 00:22:45,754
in the meantime,
all you're doing

412
00:22:45,788 --> 00:22:47,485
is reminding us
that she's missing.

413
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:51,922
No one's forcing you
to sit here.

414
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:58,036
It was the Badlands.

415
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:01,285
What?

416
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,345
What?

417
00:23:02,388 --> 00:23:04,722
You said something
about the Badlands.

418
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,788
Oh. Worf.

419
00:23:07,832 --> 00:23:09,563
If his escape pod hadn't
drifted into the Badlands

420
00:23:09,603 --> 00:23:11,539
the <i>Defiant</i> would have picked
him up and Ezri wouldn't

421
00:23:11,573 --> 00:23:13,007
have had to go
looking for him.

422
00:23:13,043 --> 00:23:15,571
Never thought I'd hear
myself saying this

423
00:23:15,615 --> 00:23:19,350
but I wish the <i>Defiant</i> had found
that lumbering Klingon oaf.

424
00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:22,122
Well, we can't do anything
to change what's happened.

425
00:23:22,161 --> 00:23:24,826
We just have to hope
for the best.

426
00:23:24,866 --> 00:23:26,961
Funny, I was just
starting to...

427
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,041
Starting to what?

428
00:23:33,117 --> 00:23:34,608
I don't know.

429
00:23:34,653 --> 00:23:37,853
But there was something...

430
00:23:37,892 --> 00:23:39,555
something about her,
wasn't there?

431
00:23:39,596 --> 00:23:41,862
Something that made
me happy anyway.

432
00:23:41,935 --> 00:23:46,570
She was this old soul
and yet so young at heart

433
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,671
and... and...

434
00:23:48,714 --> 00:23:51,048
I don't know what I'm saying.

435
00:23:52,288 --> 00:23:53,449
Hmm.

436
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:07,942
Where is he?

437
00:24:07,987 --> 00:24:09,752
He'll be here any moment.

438
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:10,848
He said there were certain

439
00:24:10,925 --> 00:24:13,488
security precautions
that had to be observed

440
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:16,093
before the Orb was allowed

441
00:24:16,136 --> 00:24:17,799
to leave
the shrine.

442
00:24:19,175 --> 00:24:21,338
May I ask
what you're planning?

443
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,609
No, you may not.

444
00:24:26,156 --> 00:24:30,096
This is far beyond your ability
to comprehend, Anjohl.

445
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:33,293
Come in.

446
00:24:36,243 --> 00:24:38,908
The Orb of Prophecy.

447
00:24:38,982 --> 00:24:40,747
Place it on the table and...

448
00:24:40,785 --> 00:24:41,946
and then go.

449
00:24:50,137 --> 00:24:52,130
How may I serve you?

450
00:24:53,677 --> 00:24:55,909
You are not required here.
Thank you.

451
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:06,860
There's nothing to fear.

452
00:25:06,903 --> 00:25:09,875
Of course not. I'm the Kai.

453
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:12,881
The Prophets will make
everything clear to me.

454
00:25:28,947 --> 00:25:30,940
Something's wrong.

455
00:25:31,018 --> 00:25:32,486
What?

456
00:25:32,522 --> 00:25:34,754
There's nothing.

457
00:25:36,963 --> 00:25:39,491
The Prophets show me nothing.

458
00:25:39,536 --> 00:25:42,303
They won't speak to me.

459
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:46,581
They have forsaken me...

460
00:25:49,055 --> 00:25:52,323
...because I have been
in communion with the evil one.

461
00:25:52,361 --> 00:25:53,693
Adami...

462
00:25:55,467 --> 00:25:59,430
I know this may be
hard to hear, but...

463
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,809
you must listen.

464
00:26:04,752 --> 00:26:06,779
I've hidden
something from you.

465
00:26:06,823 --> 00:26:10,284
I didn't come here by chance.

466
00:26:10,331 --> 00:26:12,928
I had a vision.

467
00:26:12,969 --> 00:26:15,839
The true Gods of Bajor
came to me

468
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:18,540
and asked me to serve them.

469
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,482
The true Gods?

470
00:26:20,517 --> 00:26:22,510
The Pah-wraiths.

471
00:26:22,555 --> 00:26:23,921
They led me to you.

472
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:24,925
No!

473
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,690
They're not evil.
They care about Bajor.

474
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:27,698
No!

475
00:26:27,732 --> 00:26:29,565
They want
to make Bajor strong.

476
00:26:29,602 --> 00:26:31,265
Heretic.

477
00:26:31,873 --> 00:26:32,841
Listen to me.

478
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:34,002
Get away!

479
00:26:34,077 --> 00:26:35,774
Enough!

480
00:26:35,814 --> 00:26:39,948
The Prophets have done
nothing for you.

481
00:26:39,989 --> 00:26:42,517
During the occupation,
they turned their backs

482
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:44,292
and let our people suffer.

483
00:26:44,332 --> 00:26:46,165
Let me go.

484
00:26:46,202 --> 00:26:48,695
You've sacrificed
everything for them

485
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,972
and how have
they rewarded you?

486
00:26:51,011 --> 00:26:53,413
They've appointed
an alien Emissary.

487
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,818
They've rejected you
at every turn.

488
00:26:55,854 --> 00:26:58,519
Even now,
they won't speak to you.

489
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,528
Solbor!

490
00:26:59,562 --> 00:27:00,860
Shh!

491
00:27:00,898 --> 00:27:03,368
Listen to me, please.

492
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:07,640
The Pah-wraiths
will give you everything

493
00:27:07,678 --> 00:27:09,671
you've ever dreamt of...

494
00:27:09,716 --> 00:27:11,207
the power...

495
00:27:11,252 --> 00:27:14,953
the adoration of the people.

496
00:27:14,993 --> 00:27:20,129
In spite of your
protestations of humility

497
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:22,903
that's what you really want;
admit it.

498
00:27:22,942 --> 00:27:26,746
Stop pretending to be
something you're not.

499
00:27:26,783 --> 00:27:30,119
Take what they're offering you.

500
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,733
Get out.

501
00:27:46,356 --> 00:27:48,417
Go.

502
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,555
Crawl back
to your Prophets.

503
00:27:50,597 --> 00:27:52,999
Beg their forgiveness.

504
00:27:53,035 --> 00:27:55,836
Live the rest of your life...

505
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,174
in Sisko's shadow!

506
00:28:16,783 --> 00:28:19,949
I'll do anything you ask.

507
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,790
You need only give the word.

508
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:31,708
Have you nothing to say to me?

509
00:28:33,283 --> 00:28:36,119
Am I so offensive to your eyes

510
00:28:36,155 --> 00:28:39,457
that I don't exist
for you anymore?

511
00:28:48,346 --> 00:28:51,512
There must be something I can do
to prove to you

512
00:28:51,553 --> 00:28:55,357
that I'm still worthy
of your love.

513
00:29:10,724 --> 00:29:12,215
Go ahead.

514
00:29:12,261 --> 00:29:14,322
This is Kai Winn.

515
00:29:14,365 --> 00:29:16,392
I need to speak with you.

516
00:29:16,436 --> 00:29:18,463
Would you come to my quarters?

517
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,710
Of course.

518
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:27,852
Colonel Kira to see you,
Eminence.

519
00:29:30,897 --> 00:29:32,297
Come in, my child.

520
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,435
Please sit down.

521
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:36,669
Thank you

522
00:29:36,709 --> 00:29:38,770
for seeing me
at such a late hour.

523
00:29:40,016 --> 00:29:41,918
What can I do for you?

524
00:29:44,892 --> 00:29:47,362
I have often sensed...

525
00:29:47,398 --> 00:29:51,133
that you don't approve
of how I conduct myself as Kai...

526
00:29:51,171 --> 00:29:53,334
that you believe

527
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:55,676
I put my own political interests

528
00:29:55,714 --> 00:29:58,447
ahead of the spiritual
well-being of our people.

529
00:29:58,486 --> 00:30:00,479
I wish I could disagree

530
00:30:00,524 --> 00:30:02,187
with that assessment.

531
00:30:05,266 --> 00:30:07,999
I have strayed from the path

532
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:10,169
the Prophets
have laid down for me.

533
00:30:10,302 --> 00:30:12,272
Eminence...

534
00:30:12,306 --> 00:30:13,866
You don't know.

535
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,777
You don't know.

536
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:18,144
Eminence.

537
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:23,854
When you told me
that the Prophets

538
00:30:23,896 --> 00:30:24,989
had spoken to you

539
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:28,129
I prayed that they
would open your heart

540
00:30:28,171 --> 00:30:30,232
that they would change you.

541
00:30:30,276 --> 00:30:33,476
Oh, I want to change.

542
00:30:33,516 --> 00:30:37,251
I would... I'd do anything
to earn their forgiveness

543
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,656
but I'm afraid it's too late.

544
00:30:38,693 --> 00:30:40,686
It's never too late.

545
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:44,258
The worst of us
can be redeemed.

546
00:30:44,304 --> 00:30:46,501
How?

547
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:48,944
Well, I-I'm
not a vedek...

548
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,852
but it seems to me that
you have to set aside

549
00:30:52,888 --> 00:30:55,621
the things that
led you astray...

550
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,459
ambition, jealousy.

551
00:30:57,497 --> 00:31:02,838
Oh, yes. I have given in
to the temptations of power.

552
00:31:02,874 --> 00:31:04,673
Turn away from temptation.

553
00:31:04,712 --> 00:31:05,680
Yes.

554
00:31:05,714 --> 00:31:08,550
Give yourself over
to the Prophets.

555
00:31:08,586 --> 00:31:10,215
I'll do whatever it takes

556
00:31:10,255 --> 00:31:12,623
to make myself worthy
in their eyes.

557
00:31:15,132 --> 00:31:19,904
Everything will change
once you step down as Kai.

558
00:31:19,942 --> 00:31:21,069
You'll see.

559
00:31:21,111 --> 00:31:22,477
Step down?

560
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:25,346
I don't understand.

561
00:31:25,387 --> 00:31:27,448
Why would I do that?

562
00:31:27,491 --> 00:31:29,256
Bajor needs me.

563
00:31:29,293 --> 00:31:32,390
E-Eminence...

564
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:34,199
being in power

565
00:31:34,237 --> 00:31:36,605
is what led you
on the wrong path.

566
00:31:36,642 --> 00:31:39,112
But I've resolved to change.

567
00:31:39,948 --> 00:31:42,282
Don't you see?

568
00:31:45,427 --> 00:31:49,197
Once I have regained
the Prophets' trust

569
00:31:49,233 --> 00:31:53,071
I'll be better able
to serve them if I remain Kai.

570
00:31:55,078 --> 00:31:57,606
If the Prophets wanted
me to step down

571
00:31:57,651 --> 00:31:59,951
surely they would have
told me so.

572
00:32:01,425 --> 00:32:05,195
They don't always use words
to make their wishes known.

573
00:32:05,232 --> 00:32:09,730
Sometimes they speak to us
by touching our hearts

574
00:32:09,842 --> 00:32:13,281
but... only you would know
if they had done that.

575
00:32:13,315 --> 00:32:16,685
But Bajor needs me.

576
00:32:18,225 --> 00:32:19,990
Good night, Eminence.

577
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:31,978
Yeah... Oh, Damar.

578
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:34,251
Oh, there you are.

579
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,385
I want you to hear this.

580
00:32:36,427 --> 00:32:38,454
Thot Gor had an
interesting observation

581
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:40,992
regarding our forces
along the Romulan border.

582
00:32:41,037 --> 00:32:43,098
In his view, we have failed

583
00:32:43,141 --> 00:32:44,166
to take advantage

584
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,112
of several weaknesses
in their defenses.

585
00:32:46,147 --> 00:32:47,115
Is that so?

586
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:49,176
For instance

587
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,656
the Romulan colony
in the Unroth system

588
00:32:51,692 --> 00:32:52,921
is ripe for attack.

589
00:32:52,961 --> 00:32:55,831
Their long-range-sensor
array is being repaired...

590
00:32:55,867 --> 00:32:56,926
Septimus III has fallen.

591
00:32:56,969 --> 00:32:58,096
Excuse me?

592
00:32:58,138 --> 00:32:59,436
Septimus III.

593
00:32:59,473 --> 00:33:03,379
An entire Cardassian Order has
been wiped out... 500,000 men.

594
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:05,612
Oh, yes. A great tragedy.

595
00:33:05,653 --> 00:33:07,053
You promised reinforcements.

596
00:33:07,089 --> 00:33:08,580
I promised nothing
of the kind.

597
00:33:08,626 --> 00:33:11,257
I said the situation would be
dealt with, and it was.

598
00:33:11,297 --> 00:33:13,290
By leaving them to be
slaughtered by the Klingons.

599
00:33:13,335 --> 00:33:15,805
If you will calm down

600
00:33:15,873 --> 00:33:18,401
and listen, I will explain.

601
00:33:18,445 --> 00:33:21,383
The sacrifice made
by the 11th Order

602
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:23,182
will not be in vain.

603
00:33:23,221 --> 00:33:24,815
They forced the Klingons

604
00:33:24,925 --> 00:33:28,831
to commit worthwhile,
valuable troops and resources

605
00:33:28,933 --> 00:33:31,962
to capture a strategically
worthless planet.

606
00:33:33,108 --> 00:33:34,098
I'm glad you agree.

607
00:33:34,143 --> 00:33:35,270
Well, I don't.

608
00:33:35,312 --> 00:33:37,509
You condemned a half a million
loyal Cardassians...

609
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,518
If they were

610
00:33:38,552 --> 00:33:39,952
truly loyal Cardassians

611
00:33:39,988 --> 00:33:41,685
then they died willingly
for the Dominion.

612
00:33:41,725 --> 00:33:43,216
There could be
no greater sacrifice.

613
00:33:43,261 --> 00:33:44,787
How many more sacrifices

614
00:33:44,831 --> 00:33:46,494
will my people be asked to make?

615
00:33:47,737 --> 00:33:49,069
Your people, Damar?

616
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:55,547
We are all one
with the Dominion...

617
00:33:55,586 --> 00:33:58,558
Vorta, Cardassian,
Jem'Hadar, the Breen.

618
00:33:59,895 --> 00:34:03,460
We all serve the Founders,
and we will all make

619
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:07,373
whatever sacrifices
they deem necessary.

620
00:34:07,409 --> 00:34:09,003
Thot Gor, would you mind

621
00:34:09,046 --> 00:34:10,777
reiterating your plan
for the Unroth system?

622
00:34:10,817 --> 00:34:13,755
I seem to have lost
my train of thought.

623
00:34:19,835 --> 00:34:21,771
Yes, I know.

624
00:34:21,805 --> 00:34:23,536
It's become increasingly
difficult to get

625
00:34:23,576 --> 00:34:25,409
a full day's work out of him.

626
00:35:02,687 --> 00:35:06,091
The Dax symbiont has lived
for over 300 years

627
00:35:06,127 --> 00:35:08,655
experienced eight lifetimes

628
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:10,862
and now it's all going to end

629
00:35:10,903 --> 00:35:13,534
with an execution on Cardassia.

630
00:35:13,575 --> 00:35:16,638
Ezri Tigan's contribution
to the Dax legacy

631
00:35:16,682 --> 00:35:19,084
will be to end it.

632
00:35:22,459 --> 00:35:25,659
There is no honor
in self-pity.

633
00:35:28,404 --> 00:35:31,467
You know, Worf,
I have had just about enough

634
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,946
of your little
Klingon aphorisms.

635
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:36,042
The only reason
I came on this mission

636
00:35:36,087 --> 00:35:37,784
was to save
your miserable life.

637
00:35:37,824 --> 00:35:39,156
So the least you could do

638
00:35:39,193 --> 00:35:41,960
is stop acting like
such a self-righteous <i>targ.</i>

639
00:35:42,032 --> 00:35:45,631
Your motives for rescuing
me are not honorable.

640
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:49,870
Do you really think that I would
disobey orders and risk my life

641
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:51,885
so that I could seduce you?

642
00:35:51,919 --> 00:35:55,153
I hate to burst your bubble,
Worf, but it wasn't that good.

643
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,120
Always the barb.

644
00:35:58,164 --> 00:35:59,598
Always the joke.

645
00:35:59,633 --> 00:36:02,126
There was a time when you found
my sense of humor

646
00:36:02,172 --> 00:36:04,335
to be one
of my more endearing qualities.

647
00:36:04,376 --> 00:36:07,314
That was Jadzia, not you.

648
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:10,583
Are you angry at me
for something that I did

649
00:36:10,622 --> 00:36:12,922
or because I'm not Jadzia?

650
00:36:17,904 --> 00:36:20,501
Let's cut right to the heart
of the matter.

651
00:36:20,542 --> 00:36:21,942
Do you love me?

652
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,470
Me, Ezri?

653
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:26,486
You are trying to turn this
around and make it about me.

654
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,545
Answer the question.

655
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:28,818
Do you love me?

656
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:30,350
I have made my
feelings clear

657
00:36:30,395 --> 00:36:31,693
back on Goralis III.

658
00:36:34,871 --> 00:36:36,898
What is it, Worf?

659
00:36:36,942 --> 00:36:39,573
Could it be
that you're feeling...

660
00:36:39,613 --> 00:36:42,676
just a little guilty
because you don't have

661
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,054
the same feelings for me
that you did for Jadzia?

662
00:36:46,862 --> 00:36:49,162
If that's true...

663
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:53,037
then maybe we both made
a mistake back on Goralis.

664
00:36:53,107 --> 00:36:56,079
So maybe we both
should be forgiven.

665
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,625
This night would be better spent

666
00:37:04,663 --> 00:37:06,496
preparing ourselves
for the next life

667
00:37:06,534 --> 00:37:08,936
instead of rehashing
the mistakes of this one.

668
00:37:35,592 --> 00:37:37,255
You are right.

669
00:37:40,803 --> 00:37:41,793
What?

670
00:37:43,107 --> 00:37:45,407
I said you are right.

671
00:37:46,915 --> 00:37:49,785
I do not love you
as I loved Jadzia.

672
00:37:58,504 --> 00:38:00,906
There's no crime in that.

673
00:38:00,943 --> 00:38:03,379
Oh, I dishonored myself.

674
00:38:05,084 --> 00:38:07,145
I know how often
I use that word

675
00:38:07,189 --> 00:38:09,020
maybe too often,
but in this case

676
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:10,644
it is appropriate.

677
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:12,318
Go on.

678
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:14,420
From the first moment
you came on the station

679
00:38:14,464 --> 00:38:16,627
I knew you were not Jadzia

680
00:38:16,668 --> 00:38:19,663
and yet... I knew there was
a part of Jadzia

681
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,869
still alive within you.

682
00:38:22,981 --> 00:38:25,213
On Goralis...

683
00:38:25,252 --> 00:38:28,383
I... allowed myself
to see her

684
00:38:28,425 --> 00:38:30,156
instead of you.

685
00:38:31,231 --> 00:38:33,064
I felt the same way.

686
00:38:34,303 --> 00:38:36,398
Part of me...

687
00:38:36,441 --> 00:38:38,502
the part that was your wife...

688
00:38:38,545 --> 00:38:40,742
wanted very much
to be close to you.

689
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:44,921
I realize
Jadzia saw physical love

690
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:46,723
differently than I do.

691
00:38:46,794 --> 00:38:49,561
To her, it could mean
many things

692
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,504
but to me,
it was a deeply spiritual act.

693
00:38:53,976 --> 00:38:56,139
When I made love to you...

694
00:38:56,181 --> 00:38:59,415
my motives were not spiritual.

695
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,951
It was an unworthy impulse.

696
00:39:02,994 --> 00:39:07,196
Worf, we're not Gods
or Prophets.

697
00:39:07,236 --> 00:39:08,534
We're people.

698
00:39:08,572 --> 00:39:10,405
We make mistakes.

699
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:17,715
There is one other thing
I want you to know.

700
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:22,891
I honestly didn't realize
how I felt about Julian.

701
00:39:22,934 --> 00:39:24,995
I would've never hidden
something like that

702
00:39:25,038 --> 00:39:26,233
from you.

703
00:39:26,274 --> 00:39:27,640
I believe you...

704
00:39:27,676 --> 00:39:31,514
and I do not hold any malice
toward you or Dr. Bashir.

705
00:39:31,551 --> 00:39:33,214
That's good to know.

706
00:39:37,396 --> 00:39:38,455
Friends?

707
00:39:41,404 --> 00:39:42,372
And more.

708
00:39:42,406 --> 00:39:44,205
And more.

709
00:39:48,718 --> 00:39:51,315
It appears all we
have left to do is

710
00:39:51,357 --> 00:39:52,791
to be executed.

711
00:39:52,894 --> 00:39:55,889
Sounds like a lazy day to me.

712
00:39:59,707 --> 00:40:00,732
It's time.

713
00:40:20,282 --> 00:40:22,184
There's a Cardassian
patrol ship sitting

714
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:24,121
in Launch Bay 3-A,
two levels above us.

715
00:40:24,156 --> 00:40:26,388
Its computers have all
the necessary information

716
00:40:26,427 --> 00:40:27,953
to get you past
our security checkpoints.

717
00:40:27,997 --> 00:40:30,194
Why are you doing this?

718
00:40:30,235 --> 00:40:32,637
I want you to give a
message to the Federation.

719
00:40:32,673 --> 00:40:35,406
Tell them they have
an ally on Cardassia.

720
00:40:35,445 --> 00:40:36,971
Why should we trust you?

721
00:40:37,015 --> 00:40:38,848
You can either trust me...

722
00:40:38,885 --> 00:40:40,980
or you can stay here
and be executed.

723
00:40:43,027 --> 00:40:44,724
I vote for option one.

724
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,314
Escaped?!

725
00:40:58,358 --> 00:40:59,553
How could this have happened?

726
00:40:59,593 --> 00:41:01,324
You're the one that
put the Jem'Hadar

727
00:41:01,364 --> 00:41:02,855
in charge
of the detention area.

728
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,927
Thank you for reminding me.

729
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,199
No, I assure you

730
00:41:07,242 --> 00:41:09,178
this is not typical
of our security procedures.

731
00:41:11,284 --> 00:41:12,445
The Founder...

732
00:41:12,486 --> 00:41:14,388
she wishes to see me.

733
00:41:14,423 --> 00:41:16,052
She has to be told about this.

734
00:41:16,093 --> 00:41:17,790
Oh, I'm sure she'll understand

735
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,230
but, if she doesn't...

736
00:41:19,266 --> 00:41:22,238
I look forward
to meeting Weyoun 9.

737
00:41:35,765 --> 00:41:37,860
Eminence...

738
00:41:37,903 --> 00:41:39,030
Anjohl is here.

739
00:41:39,073 --> 00:41:42,239
He claims you called for him.

740
00:41:42,279 --> 00:41:44,842
Show him in.

741
00:41:44,884 --> 00:41:47,150
As you wish.

742
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,242
I remember
when I first saw the gate

743
00:41:58,278 --> 00:42:00,111
of the Celestial Temple.

744
00:42:00,148 --> 00:42:02,414
I was on the Promenade.

745
00:42:02,452 --> 00:42:05,720
When it burst into view, this...

746
00:42:05,759 --> 00:42:08,731
whirlpool of color and light

747
00:42:08,765 --> 00:42:11,133
the people all around me
were in awe.

748
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,730
They said they
could feel the love

749
00:42:12,773 --> 00:42:15,438
of the Prophets
washing over them.

750
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:24,325
Do you know what I felt, Anjohl?

751
00:42:25,865 --> 00:42:27,231
Nothing.

752
00:42:27,269 --> 00:42:29,797
Absolutely nothing...

753
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,310
but I smiled and pretended

754
00:42:32,346 --> 00:42:35,682
I did, because it was
expected of me.

755
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:40,520
I've never admitted that
to anyone.

756
00:42:40,562 --> 00:42:42,828
I can understand why.

757
00:42:42,866 --> 00:42:45,963
They've never spoken to me...

758
00:42:46,006 --> 00:42:48,705
never offered me guidance...

759
00:42:48,745 --> 00:42:51,979
never trusted me
with the fruits of their wisdom

760
00:42:52,018 --> 00:42:56,152
and now, I'm supposed
to step down as Kai

761
00:42:56,193 --> 00:42:58,163
in order to be blessed by them.

762
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,265
No.

763
00:43:01,303 --> 00:43:04,275
I have worked too hard,
waited too long

764
00:43:04,309 --> 00:43:06,108
to give it all up now.

765
00:43:06,147 --> 00:43:07,980
You shouldn't have to.

766
00:43:08,016 --> 00:43:12,685
Merciful Gods
don't ask their children

767
00:43:12,726 --> 00:43:14,821
to make such sacrifices.

768
00:43:14,863 --> 00:43:16,799
The Prophets have turned

769
00:43:16,834 --> 00:43:19,499
their backs on me...
after all I've done for them

770
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,942
all the pain I've endured
for them.

771
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:24,608
They're not worthy of you,
Adami.

772
00:43:25,618 --> 00:43:27,679
I'm a patient woman...

773
00:43:27,723 --> 00:43:30,456
but I have run out of patience.

774
00:43:30,495 --> 00:43:34,959
I will no longer serve Gods
who give me nothing in return.

775
00:43:35,003 --> 00:43:37,736
I'm ready to walk the path

776
00:43:37,776 --> 00:43:40,646
the Pah-wraiths
have laid out for me.

777
00:43:40,682 --> 00:43:42,743
I'll walk with you...

778
00:43:44,857 --> 00:43:46,793
and no one...

779
00:43:46,827 --> 00:43:50,699
will be able
to stand against us.

780
00:43:50,735 --> 00:43:52,637
Those who dare to try...

781
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:55,906
the Federation and
its Vedek puppets

782
00:43:55,945 --> 00:44:00,785
the false Gods and their
precious Emissary...

783
00:44:00,822 --> 00:44:03,258
they'll all be swept aside

784
00:44:03,294 --> 00:44:06,289
like dead leaves
before an angry wind.
