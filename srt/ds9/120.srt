1
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,297
O'BRIEN: Try one.
You'll like it.

2
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:07,424
Too early for me.
You sure?

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,717
It's so sweet.

4
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,845
It's a natural sweetness

5
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:12,972
from the sap
of the<i> jumja</i> tree.

6
00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:15,349
It's full
of vitamin C.

7
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:18,101
Since when did you
become such an expert
on<i> jumja</i> sticks?

8
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:21,355
Oh, Neela told me.
Did she?

9
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,649
Mm-hmm.
So...

10
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:26,527
she working out any better
than the last one?

11
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,821
Who, Neela?
She's terrific.

12
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:30,572
She's even taught<i> me</i>
a thing or two.

13
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,282
I'm glad to hear
her expertise

14
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,368
doesn't end with
<i>jumja</i> sticks.

15
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:37,621
No. She's
a really good engi...

16
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:40,290
Hold on.
What?

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,584
Well...
you're not thinking...?

18
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,252
Well, Keiko!

19
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,881
Just keeping you
on your toes, O'Brien.

20
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:48,799
Oh, very funny.

21
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,969
Be careful
who you share
your<i> jumja</i> with.

22
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,525
KEIKO:
Now, as we discussed
in yesterday's lesson

23
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:09,737
the wormhole was discovered
by Commander Sisko

24
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:12,239
and Lieutenant Dax
earlier this year.

25
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:17,745
Does anyone know
what makes this wormhole
so unusual?

26
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,371
Jake?

27
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:22,332
It's stable?
It's stable.
That's right, Jake.

28
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:26,169
It's the first stable wormhole
known to exist...

29
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,591
Please, continue.

30
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,969
A stable wormhole
is very important

31
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,847
because it allows us to travel,
secure in the knowledge

32
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,349
that neither end
will shift locations.

33
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:43,771
Who knows why this wormhole
is stable?

34
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:47,274
Because it was
artificially constructed.

35
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,777
Commander Sisko
encountered the entities

36
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:52,696
who created the wormhole
when he went...
Excuse me.

37
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:56,199
By entities,
do you not mean the Prophets?

38
00:01:56,199 --> 00:02:00,495
Yes, on Bajor, the entities
are worshipped as Prophets.

39
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:04,041
<i>Our</i> studies of
the wormhole have shown
that it was formed

40
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,293
by unique particles
we call "verterons"

41
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:09,337
that are apparently
self-sustaining in nature.

42
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,381
This begins to explain

43
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,802
how a ship at impulse can safely
pass through without...

44
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:17,304
Ships are safely
guided through
the passage

45
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,723
by the hands
of the Prophets.

46
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,642
In a manner of speaking.

47
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:25,062
Not, apparently,
in<i> your</i> manner
of speaking.

48
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:28,148
Perhaps we should discuss this
after class.

49
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,359
Do you believe
the Celestial Temple
of the Prophets

50
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,779
exists within the passage?

51
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:37,658
I respect
that the Bajoran people
believe that it does.

52
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,410
But that's not what you teach.

53
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,999
No. I don't teach
Bajoran spiritual beliefs.
That's your job.

54
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:48,002
Mine is to open
the children's minds to...

55
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:51,546
history, to literature,
to mathematics, to science.

56
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,341
You<i> are</i> opening
the children's minds--

57
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,926
to blasphemy,

58
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:59,096
and I cannot permit it
to continue.

59
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,471
Sorry I couldn't
get here sooner.

60
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,598
Another fusion reactor
went down.

61
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,017
How's it going?
Done.

62
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,103
Done?

63
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:13,939
Did you remember to
re-initialize the isolinear
coprocessor?

64
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:17,276
I did it exactly
like you showed me.
Should I test it?

65
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:20,862
Well, uh, let me.
You know us old folks.
We like to feel useful.

66
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:26,994
Not bad.
Not bad at all.

67
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,204
You keep this up,
I'll be out of a job.

68
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,539
I doubt that.

69
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,125
Let's close it up.

70
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,009
Not that one.
That's a security seal.

71
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:45,179
You need an
EJ7 interlock
to close it.

72
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,888
EJ7?

73
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,850
Yeah. That's okay.
I have one here.

74
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,559
Bloody hell.

75
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:54,271
What's wrong?

76
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,940
Well, my EJ7 is missing.

77
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,651
It was here yesterday.

78
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,778
Maybe you left it
in Ops.

79
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,281
No. I...

80
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,450
I don't misplace
my tools.

81
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,161
I'm not exactly surprised.

82
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,330
You<i> knew</i> this was
going to happen?

83
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,915
A confrontation like this
was inevitable.

84
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:19,046
Sometimes I wonder
if we'll ever find
the common ground we need

85
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:22,465
to bring Bajor
into the Federation.

86
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,301
Major, would you join us?

87
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,723
We've been talking
about an incident
this morning at school.

88
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,059
I heard.
Vedek Winn's been meeting

89
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,977
with some of the Bajoran
civilians about it.

90
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,354
What do you know about her?

91
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,981
She's from an
orthodox order.

92
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,817
She has some support
to become the next Kai...

93
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,236
probably not enough.

94
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,029
The question is,
how much support

95
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,697
does she have
on<i> this</i> station?

96
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,032
She has mine.

97
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,201
KEIKO:
You can't possibly believe

98
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:53,372
teaching the facts
about the wormhole
amounts to blasphemy.

99
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:56,624
I think some revisions
in the school curriculum
might be appropriate.

100
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,752
You teach a lot
of Bajoran children.

101
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,671
I'm not going to let
a Bajoran spiritual leader

102
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:05,550
dictate what can
or can't be taught
in my classroom.

103
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,178
Then maybe we need
two schools
on this station--

104
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,804
one for the
Bajoran children

105
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,890
and another for
the Federation.

106
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,227
If we start separating Bajoran
and Federation interests...

107
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,229
A lot of Bajoran and
Federation interests

108
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:18,897
<i>are</i> separate,
Commander.

109
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,648
I've been telling
you that all along.

110
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,525
Nobody's saying
that there can't be

111
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,819
spiritual teaching
on the station, Major,

112
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,864
but can't it be
in addition to what's taught
in Mrs. O'Brien's classroom?

113
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,159
But if she's teaching
a fundamentally
different philosophy...

114
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,203
I'm not teaching
any<i> philosophy.</i>

115
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,580
What I'm trying to teach
is pure science.

116
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,332
Some might say
pure science

117
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,751
taught without a
spiritual context

118
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,087
<i>is</i> a philosophy,
Mrs. O'Brien.

119
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,381
<i>My</i> philosophy is
that there is room

120
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,341
for all philosophies
on this station.

121
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:49,510
Now, how do you suggest
that we deal with this?

122
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,807
I'm not sure
you can.

123
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:19,540
I can't tell you how much
I've looked forward
to this moment.

124
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:26,340
I'm honored to meet
the Emissary to the Prophets.

125
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,342
If you'd let me know you
were coming, Vedek Winn,

126
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,302
I would have
greeted you sooner.

127
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:33,847
I did not wish to bother you
with my insignificant visit.

128
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,641
I'd hardly call it
insignificant.

129
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,186
Thank you, Emissary.

130
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,438
I wish you wouldn't
call me that.

131
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:44,649
I'm Commander Sisko,
or Benjamin, if you like.

132
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,985
But you<i> are</i> the Emissary.

133
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,237
Don't you know
the cherished place

134
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:52,157
you have earned
in the Bajoran spiritual life?

135
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,909
I'm not sure
I'm comfortable
in that role.

136
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:59,206
The course the Prophets
choose for us

137
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:03,710
may not always be comfortable
but we must follow it.

138
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:06,838
May I?

139
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,849
Still the disbeliever.

140
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,600
I once asked Kai Opaka

141
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,854
why a disbeliever was destined
to seek the Prophets

142
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:26,274
and she told me that one
must never look into the eyes

143
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,609
of one's own gods.

144
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,531
I disagreed.

145
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:36,826
I told her I would do anything
to look into their eyes.

146
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:40,372
She suggested that I sit
in darkness for a day,

147
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:43,208
and quite properly so.

148
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,545
She cannot be replaced,
and I miss her deeply.

149
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:50,173
It's important to me
that we resolve your problems
with the school.

150
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:55,470
The Prophets have spoken to me
through the Orbs, Emissary.

151
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,933
I understand my duty
to defend the Bajoran faith.

152
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:04,896
The teacher has dishonored
the Celestial Temple.

153
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,107
If she does not recant,

154
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:10,735
I cannot be responsible
for the consequences.

155
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,788
This still seems like
an awful lot of trouble
to go through

156
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,373
to find one tool.

157
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,250
With that interlock,
someone could access

158
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,377
every critical system
on the station.

159
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:30,255
DAX:
Chief, have you seen
Ensign Aquino recently?

160
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,048
No, now that
you mention it.

161
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,217
He didn't report for duty
this morning.

162
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,803
The computer says
he's not on the station,
but he didn't log out.

163
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,472
Have you
talked to Odo?

164
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,599
I guess I'd better.

165
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,016
Scanners are ready.

166
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,768
Computer, show location

167
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,396
of any independent
tritanium sources.

168
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:49,441
Level 3, Section 5.

169
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,192
Oh, that's the tool locker.

170
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,237
I've been through everything
in there three times.

171
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,824
What's that?

172
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,993
Looks like something
in a power conduit

173
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,078
on Level 12, Section 8.

174
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,123
What would tritanium
be doing there?

175
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,917
Computer, shut down
that conduit.

176
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,628
Reroute power flow.

177
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,505
Conduit deactivated.

178
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:12,755
Come on.

179
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,051
Over here, Chief.

180
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:25,226
That's tritanium
composite, all right.

181
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,562
Looks like our
missing interlock.

182
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:30,731
Must have been melted
by the conduit's plasma flow.

183
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,652
That still doesn't
explain how it got here
in the first place.

184
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:35,153
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

185
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,904
Hey...

186
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:40,950
I'm picking up traces
of organic material.

187
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,829
Whatever it was,
it's been pretty
well cooked.

188
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,789
Let's take a sample
to Dr. Bashir.

189
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,583
See what he can make of it.

190
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,969
Ensign Aquino made a
log entry the night
he disappeared

191
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:03,640
about some sort of plasma flow
irregularity in the conduit.

192
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,850
He indicated he was
going to fix it.

193
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,020
So, it was an accident.
Well, I guess so.

194
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,566
Bashir has confirmed that
the remains were human.

195
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:17,696
I'm sure the DNA trace
will confirm that
it<i> was</i> Aquino.

196
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,489
I'll have one, please...

197
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,075
unless you're feeling
adventurous today.

198
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,411
Sorry. We're all out.

199
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,288
What?
What are all these?

200
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,375
These aren't for sale.

201
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,210
Not for sale, huh?

202
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,337
How would you like
a<i> jumja</i> stick up...?
Miles.

203
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,838
ODO:
Is there a problem?

204
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,674
Damn right
there is!

205
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,176
I don't have to sell
anything to them
if I don't want to.

206
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,970
Why wouldn't you want
to sell to them?

207
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,265
Miles, can we go?

208
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,142
Let's go.

209
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,394
Seek the Prophets.

210
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,812
I'll seek you...
Miles!

211
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,232
Seek them yourself.

212
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,194
Maybe you were right.

213
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,154
Maybe we've no
business here.

214
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,822
I'll put in for a
transfer, and that'll...

215
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,866
No, I can't run away
from this now.

216
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,744
WINN:
...don't you
all agree?

217
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,328
What's this?

218
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,205
WINN:
If we abandon
the Prophets,

219
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,416
then everything we have...

220
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,503
Here's Mrs. O'Brien now.

221
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,795
Good morning.

222
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,715
WINN:
Are you Mr. O'Brien?

223
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,174
That's right.

224
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,385
A pleasure to meet you.

225
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:25,513
I've just been hearing
many wonderful things
about your wife

226
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,890
from the parents
of these children.

227
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,644
She apparently is
an excellent teacher.

228
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,353
Yes, she is,

229
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,564
and she doesn't deserve
what you're doing to her.

230
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,775
WINN:
I feel your anger toward me

231
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:39,110
and I forgive you for it.

232
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,195
Mrs. O'Brien,

233
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:45,283
if I've misjudged you,
I am terribly sorry.

234
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:47,034
Have I?

235
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:50,955
Is there a place in your school
for the Prophets?

236
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,831
No.

237
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:56,544
I admire you for
standing by your convictions

238
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,380
even though I disagree
with them.

239
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,509
Please believe me,
I want to find a way

240
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:06,304
to allow these children
to stay in your school.

241
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,640
I'm sure the children
and their parents

242
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,475
are happy
to hear you say that.

243
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:15,522
Let me be the one
to make the first concession.

244
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,732
I will no longer request

245
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,985
that you teach anything
about the Celestial Temple.

246
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,489
Just don't teach anything
about the wormhole at all.

247
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,990
Ignore it?

248
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,450
Find other ways,

249
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,910
other things
to teach the children.

250
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,539
And when we get
to theories of evolution

251
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,082
or creation of the universe--
what then?

252
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:38,503
We'll face those issues
when we come to them.

253
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:41,088
I'm a teacher.
My responsibility

254
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:44,925
is to expose my students
to knowledge,
not hide it from them.

255
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,345
The answer is no.

256
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,430
(<i> murmuring voices</i> )

257
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,766
I've tried to be reasonable.

258
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,130
SISKO:
If Aquino turned off the conduit

259
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,551
to fix the relay,
why did it reactivate?

260
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,845
The Cardassians only equipped
those power conduits

261
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,930
with one flow regulator
per level.

262
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,891
The computer
could have realigned it.

263
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:35,059
When the power flow
was rerouted back

264
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,311
it could have caught
him inside.

265
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,898
You don't sound
entirely convinced.

266
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:42,400
No, it all adds up, only...

267
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,068
Well, I don't know.

268
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:47,029
Spit it out, Chief.

269
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,990
He borrowed one of my tools
without asking.

270
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,827
It was 4:00 in the morning.
Maybe he didn't want
to disturb you.

271
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,995
The repairs
could have waited.

272
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,707
He was a Starfleet engineer.

273
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,126
You don't take a Chief's
tools without asking.
It's unheard of.

274
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:03,922
Are you suggesting
it might not have
been an accident?

275
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:06,507
I don't know what
I'm suggesting.

276
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,803
I only know what I know.
He should have asked.

277
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:13,514
Constable, maybe you ought
to take a closer look into this.

278
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,682
Dismissed.

279
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,059
Hi.

280
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,519
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

281
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,438
Sure.

282
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:23,190
I heard about what happened
at school.

283
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,485
Did Mrs. O'Brien
call classes off?

284
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,529
No, there was only me
and four other kids left

285
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,949
but she still kept
the school open.

286
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:34,744
She changed the lesson
to teach us
about Galileo.

287
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,622
Did you know that he was
tried by the Inquisition

288
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:40,458
for teaching that the Earth
moved around the sun?

289
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,127
Tried and convicted.
His books were burned.

290
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,421
How could anyone
be so stupid?

291
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,256
It's easy to look back
seven centuries

292
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,258
and judge what was
right and wrong.

293
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,135
But the same thing
is happening now

294
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,846
with all this stuff
about the Celestial Temple

295
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,889
and the wormhole.
It's dumb.

296
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,892
No, it's not.

297
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,687
You've got to realize
something, Jake.

298
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,898
For over 50 years, the one thing
that allowed the Bajorans

299
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:06,818
to survive
the Cardassian occupation
was their faith.

300
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:10,112
The Prophets
were their only source
of hope and courage.

301
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,990
But there were no Prophets.

302
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,283
They were just aliens that
you found in the wormhole.

303
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,076
To those aliens,

304
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,579
the future is no more
difficult to see
than the past.

305
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,874
Why shouldn't they be
considered Prophets?

306
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,416
Are you serious?

307
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,545
My point is, it's a matter
of interpretation.

308
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,923
It may not be what you believe,
but that doesn't make it wrong.

309
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:31,091
If you start
to think that way,

310
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,678
you'll be acting
just like Vedek Winn.

311
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,763
Only from the other side.

312
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:39,976
We can't afford
to think that way, Jake.

313
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,311
We'd lose everything
we've worked for here.

314
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,356
You're worried,
aren't you?

315
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,697
What are you
going to do?

316
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,657
I'm not sure,

317
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,744
but I think I've got
to find some help.

318
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,192
I'm sorry to keep you
waiting, Commander.

319
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,903
Vedek Bareil?

320
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,949
No need to pay
tribute to me.

321
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:39,619
Pay tribute?
I was just...

322
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,580
Usually when I meet
one of Bajor's spiritual leaders

323
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,290
the first thing they do
is grab my...

324
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,625
Ear?

325
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,627
It's unpleasant,
isn't it?

326
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,170
I've been far too polite
to admit it.

327
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:55,051
I was five the first time one
of the monks grabbed my ear.

328
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,011
He was a stern old crow

329
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:59,346
who could virtually squeeze
the<i> pagh</i> out of you

330
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,057
with his thumb and forefinger.

331
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,183
And as a chronic
misbehaver,

332
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,394
I was his
favorite victim.

333
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,981
I swore one of
my life's goals

334
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,733
would be to do away
with that archaic ritual.

335
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,111
You can count
on the Federation's support.

336
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:14,862
(<i> chuckling</i> )

337
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,907
I hope you don't mind
if I do a little planting

338
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,492
while we talk.

339
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,535
All those hours
of listening

340
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,455
to 112 vedeks
talking at once

341
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,166
made me yearn
for the sanctity

342
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,584
of my arboretum.

343
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,920
Is this yours?

344
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,799
I began my service at the
monastery as the gardener.

345
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,593
I had no other
ambition but to grow

346
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:41,305
the most lovely Feloran
bromeliads on the planet.

347
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,851
Unfortunately,
the Prophets

348
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,937
did not allow me
that peaceful life.

349
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,568
I understand my friend
Vedek Winn

350
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,571
has brought her blessings
to your station.

351
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,908
I was hoping you might be able

352
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,827
to arrange an audience
with the Assembly

353
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,912
so I could discuss
our school.

354
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,998
Why me?

355
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:09,709
You<i> are</i> the leading
candidate to become
the next Kai.

356
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,795
Your ideology
is quite different
than Vedek Winn's.

357
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,673
You have been correctly
informed.

358
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,222
I'm sorry, Commander.

359
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,683
The Vedek Assembly
will not see you.

360
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,061
Why not?

361
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:31,689
Some fear you as the symbol
of a Federation

362
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,983
they view as godless.

363
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:38,529
Some fear you as the Emissary
who walked with the Prophets.

364
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:43,283
And some fear you because
Vedek Winn told them to.

365
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,870
Oh, we're all very good
at conjuring up enough fear

366
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,581
to justify whatever
we want to do.

367
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:52,251
Today, I am only a vedek.

368
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:56,255
If the Prophets will it,
someday I may be Kai

369
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,842
and I can be a better friend
to you then.

370
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,510
In other words,

371
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,138
being my friend now
might hurt your chances.

372
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:07,767
The Prophets teach us patience.

373
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:11,311
It appears they also
teach you politics.

374
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:18,569
I'm sorry you made
this long trip
for nothing, Commander.

375
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:23,532
Please stay
and enjoy the gardens
as long as you like.

376
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:54,354
Is it my imagination
or are we a little
shorthanded today?

377
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:57,524
Three Bajoran crewmen
didn't report for duty.

378
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,359
They said
they weren't feeling well.

379
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,280
Do you think
it's contagious, Major?

380
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,990
It's too early to tell.

381
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,326
Are your people willing
to throw away

382
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,204
everything we've accomplished
during the past seven months?

383
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,206
Everyone knows if
the Federation leaves

384
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,167
the Cardassians
will be back.

385
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:15,960
With all due respect,
Major,

386
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,004
protecting your borders
is not the primary reason

387
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:21,423
the Federation is here,
and it's not why<i> I'm</i> here.

388
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,260
I'm here to build a trusting
relationship with your people

389
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,553
and I'd like to start feeling
that somebody...

390
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:29,265
<i>somebody</i> on your side
is giving something back
to that effort.

391
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:32,185
I think I've given
you all the support
I can, short of...

392
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:33,936
It's not enough.

393
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,315
I thought there
was room

394
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:40,234
for all philosophies
on this station.

395
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:43,070
You tell
our sick Bajoran crewmen

396
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,989
they better get well
immediately

397
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:48,242
or they'll recover on the way
to their next assignment.

398
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:51,287
Yes, sir.

399
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:54,665
Commander, Dr. Bashir has found
some new evidence

400
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:56,709
about Ensign Aquino
that you should see.

401
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,295
Sir, I've finally
managed to reconstruct
the victim's DNA.

402
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,755
It's definitely Aquino,
but the power flow

403
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,924
in the conduit
didn't kill him.

404
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,344
You see, the plasma
disruption in his
cellular membranes

405
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:07,928
indicates that
he was exposed

406
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,680
to a directed
energy discharge

407
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,350
<i>before</i> he was
placed in the conduit.

408
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,768
O'BRIEN:
A directed energy discharge?

409
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,937
From a phaser?

410
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,772
Set to kill.

411
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,869
Could this murder be related
in any way

412
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,662
to the tensions
over the school issue?

413
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,748
If you're suggesting
he was killed by a Bajoran

414
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,457
just because
he was with
the Federation...

415
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,459
The analysis proves
that he was killed

416
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,379
the night before
Vedek Winn arrived.

417
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:43,214
There wasn't
any school issue yet.

418
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:45,507
Any ideas about a motive?

419
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:50,554
All right, then let's
start at the beginning.

420
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,973
Ensign Aquino goes
to repair a power conduit.

421
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,725
One moment, Commander.

422
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:56,769
I'm not convinced of that.
But the log...

423
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,604
It could have been altered
by our killer

424
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,606
to cover his tracks.

425
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,942
I've checked the turbolift
records the night of the murder.

426
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:05,569
Aquino<i> did</i> take
a turbolift to Level 3,

427
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,822
but<i> not</i> to the power conduit
where he was found.

428
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,241
DAX:
Where did he go?

429
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:12,159
ODO:
Runabout Pad C.

430
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,578
A runabout?
What was he doing

431
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,205
in a runabout at
4:00 in the morning?

432
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:19,583
Apparently, he was
getting murdered.

433
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:29,051
Everything in the runabout
seems to be perfectly normal.

434
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:32,179
It doesn't look
like the airlock systems
have been tampered with.

435
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,348
Let's run a
level-1 diagnostic

436
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,434
on the runabout's
computer interface--
then we'll call it a day.

437
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,852
I already have.
Everything's normal.

438
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:45,109
I don't even know
what we're looking for.

439
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,694
If something
happened around here,

440
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,655
it's been pretty
well covered up.

441
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,203
Did you know him well?

442
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,579
Aquino?

443
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,206
Oh, barely at all.

444
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,749
Just the
"welcome aboard

445
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,085
if you need
anything" speech.

446
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:06,422
You?
Not really.

447
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:08,382
Bajoran
and Starfleet officers

448
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:11,509
don't really socialize
that much.

449
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,430
How come?

450
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,432
I don't know.

451
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:19,059
I guess we just
keep to ourselves.

452
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:22,480
Well, you're not
like that with me.

453
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,731
Well, you're not
like the others.

454
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:27,734
You know.

455
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:30,196
You don't put on
any airs.

456
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,613
You're just...

457
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,867
nicer.

458
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:40,456
Uh, look...

459
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:43,167
I'll close up here.

460
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,670
Why don't you take off.

461
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,546
You sure?

462
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:49,965
Yeah.

463
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,509
Yeah, I'm sure.

464
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,845
Good night.

465
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:05,398
On your toes, O'Brien.

466
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,244
You were looking for me?

467
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:19,828
Don't tell me--

468
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,872
there's a Bajoran convention
on the station

469
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:24,458
I didn't know about.
Thanks, Odo.

470
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,377
I need to call in
more dabo girls.

471
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:27,961
It's not a convention.

472
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,130
They're from an
orthodox spiritual order

473
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,007
coming to support
Vedek Winn's efforts

474
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,301
to keep the Bajoran
children out of school.

475
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,303
Orthodox?
In that case,

476
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,805
I'll need twice as many
dabo girls.

477
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:42,226
These spiritual types
love those dabo girls.

478
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:45,896
This is not what I wanted
to talk to you about.

479
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:51,485
What do you know
about the murder
of Ensign Aquino?

480
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,320
You wound me.

481
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,864
All these years together,
I thought you knew me.

482
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,033
Odo, I am not a killer.

483
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,036
No, but most of
your friends are.

484
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,081
True, and I would
gladly sell one of them
to you if I could,

485
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,792
but unfortunately,
none of them have taken credit

486
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,128
for the death
of the Starfleet officer.

487
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,337
Sorry.

488
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,214
O'BRIEN:
Odo!

489
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,216
Keep your ears open.

490
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,675
Are you kidding?

491
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,387
That's the Seventh Rule
of Acquisition.

492
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,689
This is
a security bypass module.

493
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,235
You found it at
Runabout Pad C?

494
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,613
No, that's just it.
It wasn't at Pad C.

495
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:38,282
That was as clean
as a whistle.

496
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:41,535
Just to be safe,
I ran a diagnostic
across the board.

497
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:45,205
This showed up
at Runabout Pad A.

498
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,915
Pad A...

499
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,627
Aquino never went
anywhere near Pad A.

500
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:51,337
It doesn't make sense.

501
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:54,798
On the contrary,
it makes perfect sense.

502
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,176
Ensign Aquino goes
to Runabout C

503
00:27:57,176 --> 00:28:00,095
because some sensor
shows an anomaly

504
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,763
in the security net there.

505
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,433
He interrupts whoever
is tampering with it

506
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,059
and is killed.

507
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,978
The killer puts the
body in the conduit

508
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:09,980
and instead of going
back to Pad C,

509
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,192
which might be traced with
Aquino's turbolift log,

510
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:17,446
he changes his plan
and moves to Pad A.

511
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:20,366
But what<i> was</i> the plan?
Everything else seems normal.

512
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:23,869
I'd guess somebody wanted
to steal a runabout.

513
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,078
We're not missing one.

514
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,705
Huh. It's curious.

515
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:29,458
He goes to a lot
of trouble

516
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,168
to defeat
the security net

517
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:33,128
and then doesn't
go through with...

518
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,921
(<i> explosion</i> )

519
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,215
The school!

520
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:37,799
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

521
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,093
(<i> screams</i>

522
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,016
Keiko!

523
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,270
Keiko!

524
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,235
Miles!

525
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,863
FIREMAN:
Stand back, please!

526
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,699
Clear the way!

527
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,505
What have you got?

528
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,591
I'm reading traces
of cabrodine and infernite--

529
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:21,301
common explosives,
both easily obtainable.

530
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,970
Then we're looking
at a simple, homemade bomb.

531
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,181
(<i> crowd clamoring</i> )

532
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,274
Where is Mrs. O'Brien?

533
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,734
Her husband
took her home.

534
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:38,444
Was she hurt?
Was anyone hurt?

535
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,446
No.

536
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:42,781
The Prophets have
been kind today.

537
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:46,076
The Prophets had
nothing to do with what
happened here today.

538
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:48,828
This was the work
of a disturbed
and violent mind

539
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:52,207
who listened
to your voice,
not the Prophets'.

540
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,918
Is the Emissary
holding<i> me</i> responsible

541
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,170
for this act of terrorism?

542
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,716
The Commander of
this station is.

543
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:04,261
May the Prophets forgive you
for abandoning them.

544
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:09,642
You claim the Prophets
as your personal
constituency, Vedek Winn.

545
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:12,269
I'm not convinced
that's justified.

546
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,104
Who do you speak for?

547
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:16,649
An order that's barely
listened to in your Assembly.

548
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:20,110
So you come here looking
for a more receptive audience.

549
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:24,072
Is that what your friend,
Vedek Bareil, told you?

550
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,866
He's as misguided
as you are.

551
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:29,369
No, that's not fair.

552
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:33,415
You are not simply misguided,
as I once thought.

553
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:37,586
Now I see you want nothing less
than to destroy us.

554
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:39,463
Destroy you?

555
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:42,090
You live without a soul,
Commander.

556
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,885
You and your Federation exist
in a universe of darkness

557
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:49,473
and you would drag us
in there with you.

558
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:52,934
But we will not go.

559
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:57,815
You have just made your
first mistake, Vedek.

560
00:30:57,815 --> 00:30:59,858
Have I?

561
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:04,237
The Bajorans who have lived
with us on this station,

562
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:08,116
who have worked
with us for months,

563
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:12,287
who helped us move this station
to protect the wormhole,

564
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:16,041
who joined us to explore
the Gamma Quadrant,

565
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:20,546
who have begun to
build the future
of Bajor with us,

566
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:25,551
these people know
that we are neither
the enemy nor the devil.

567
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,469
(<i> murmurs of agreement</i> )

568
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:30,347
We don't always agree.

569
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:34,267
We have some damn
good fights, in fact,

570
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,520
but we always come
away from them

571
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,731
with a little better
understanding

572
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:40,899
and appreciation
of each other.

573
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,527
You won't succeed here.

574
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,654
The school will reopen.

575
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,823
And when your
rhetoric gets old,

576
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:51,201
the Bajoran parents
will bring their children back.

577
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:54,454
We'll see.

578
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:02,838
(<i> crowd murmuring</i> )

579
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,661
How is she, Chief?

580
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,247
She's pretty
shaken up, sir,

581
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:39,833
but she's planning to
hold classes tomorrow

582
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:42,461
in one of the
small cargo bays,
if that's okay.

583
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,630
You tell her Jake
will be there on time.

584
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,340
It will make her
feel a lot better
to hear that, sir.

585
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,885
Anything new on Aquino?
Yes, sir.

586
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:53,847
I found a security
bypass module
at Runabout Pad A.

587
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:57,183
It looks like somebody
might have wanted
to steal a runabout.

588
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:59,978
That's probably why
Aquino went there
in the first place.

589
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,356
I've put security seals
in place at all three pads

590
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,692
and I'm checking for
any other anomalies.

591
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:09,321
DAX:
Benjamin, there's an incoming
transmission from Vedek Bareil

592
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,740
on board a Bajoran transport.

593
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,702
On screen.

594
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:19,623
Commander, I've decided

595
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:23,376
to accept
your gracious invitation.

596
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,378
Invitation?

597
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:28,465
You did invite me
to tour your facility.

598
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:32,552
Yes, yes, of course, Vedek.
We'd be honored.

599
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:35,263
Unfortunately, we have
some damage on our Promenade.

600
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,349
We won't have time to clean up
before you arrive.

601
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,559
Yes, I heard about it.

602
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,562
Perhaps I can help you
clean it up.

603
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,273
That would be very
much appreciated.

604
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,275
It's the least a friend can do.

605
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:50,445
I look forward
to seeing you again.

606
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:12,009
My dear,
you should not be here.

607
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:15,554
Vedek, they found out
about the runabout.

608
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,265
I see.

609
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,351
I have no way to escape.

610
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:26,773
Then we must accept that
as the will of the Prophets.

611
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:31,069
But if I go through
with this now,

612
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,697
I will be caught
and executed.

613
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,288
The sacrifices the Prophets
call on us to make

614
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:46,125
are great sometimes,
my dear,

615
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:49,087
but the rewards they give

616
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,924
will last through eternity.

617
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,723
What the hell?

618
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:04,061
Computer, identify subprogram
labeled "ANA".

619
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:05,604
That file is protected

620
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,522
by a personal
security access code.

621
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,024
On whose authority?

Chief of Operations,
Miles O'Brien.

623
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:13,737
Me? I never saw
this file before.

00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,865
Unable to comply.

State security code
to release protection.

627
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:22,037
Lieutenant, I've got to do
a manual isolation

628
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,872
of an anomalous file.

629
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:27,042
It's in the security field
subsystem labeled "ANA".

630
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:31,337
That file is going to be
protected by a series
of encryption sequences.

631
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,506
I'll run an adaptive program.

632
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:36,134
For once, we're lucky
we're working with
a Cardassian computer.

633
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,011
It shouldn't have any more
than seven sequences.

It seems our paths
have grown apart.

It's in
the isolinear coprocessor.

Didn't you just repair
that unit two days ago?

691

Yes, I did.

Looking around
at your faces,

I believe you feel
the shame I feel
at this sight.

695

No, it's got to be

those coprocessors
could possibly affect.

697
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:40,503
All weapon detectors appear
to be functional, Chief.

698
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,590
That's got to be it.

699
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,676
She's good.
She's real good.

700
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:49,304
She could make it look
like they're normal.

701
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,806
But it's got to be
the weapon detectors.

702
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,725
O'Brien to Sisko.

703
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,895
BAREIL:
Once, our world was
a center of learning.

704
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:59,105
It attracted travelers
from many other worlds.

705
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,523
Go ahead, Chief.

706
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,068
I'm not entirely sure, but...

707
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:06,196
I think the weapon detectors
on the Promenade
may have been disabled.

708
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:07,864
What do you mean,
you're not sure?

709
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:10,825
I mean Neela
may have disabled them.

710
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,202
Your assistant?

711
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,538
Yes, sir.

712
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:18,624
...to reject violence
as a solution,

713
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:21,253
to join hands
with all peoples

714
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:23,296
and begin to trust again.

715
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,464
(<i> crowd cheers</i> )

716
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,839
No!

717
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,695
(<i> crowd yelling</i> )

718
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,697
The Prophets spoke.

719
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:34,242
I answered their call.

720
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,744
The Prophets spoke!

721
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,456
I answered their call!

722
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,510
It was all
to get him here, wasn't it?

723
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,679
The school, the protest,
the bombing--

724
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,390
you knew that would get him
out of the monastery.

725
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:00,101
You did it all to kill him--

726
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:02,728
to stop him
from becoming Kai.

727
00:42:34,511 --> 00:42:37,305
Neela insists
she acted alone--

728
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:41,642
unless you want to consider
the Prophets coconspirators.

729
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,602
She'll never
tell us the truth.

730
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:47,565
We'll never be able to prove
that Winn was involved.

731
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,901
You okay?

732
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,694
Okay?

733
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,654
I've forgotten "okay."

734
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:57,575
I haven't seen "okay"
in what seems like years.

735
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,495
I was just sitting here
thinking,

736
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:03,122
last year at this time

737
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:08,378
I was fighting the Cardassians
in some nameless swamp.

738
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:10,463
And if you'd stopped by
and told me

739
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:13,132
that just one year later,
they'd be gone,

740
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,593
and I'd be wearing
this uniform,

741
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,721
up here in charge
of protecting some wormhole...

742
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,391
Protecting your
Celestial Temple.

743
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:28,022
I envied Vedek Winn
because she was
a true believer.

744
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:32,277
I wanted my faith
to be as strong as hers.

745
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:33,903
Maybe it is.

746
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,950
I've got a report
to put together
for Starfleet.

747
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,785
You ought to
get some rest.

748
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,787
I'd rather help you.

749
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,165
Commander...

750
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:49,794
I heard what you said to
Vedek Winn at the school.

751
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:53,256
I just wanted
you to know...
you were right--

752
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:55,841
what you said
about the Bajorans--

753
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:58,386
at least about me.

754
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:01,222
I don't think
that you're...

755
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:02,974
the devil.

756
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:08,062
Maybe we<i> have</i> made
some progress after all.
