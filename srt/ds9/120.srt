1
00:00:04,102 --> 00:00:06,336
Try one.
You'll like it.

2
00:00:06,374 --> 00:00:07,741
Too early for me.

3
00:00:07,777 --> 00:00:08,746
You sure?

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,044
It's so sweet.

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,916
It's a natural sweetness

6
00:00:11,955 --> 00:00:14,359
from the sap of the <i>jumja</i> tree.

7
00:00:14,395 --> 00:00:16,161
It's full of vitamin C.

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,037
Since when did you
become such an expert

9
00:00:19,073 --> 00:00:20,235
on <i>jumja</i> sticks?

10
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:21,404
Oh, Neela told me.

11
00:00:21,446 --> 00:00:22,415
Did she?

12
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:23,418
Mm-hmm.

13
00:00:23,451 --> 00:00:24,715
So...

14
00:00:24,755 --> 00:00:27,593
she working out any better
than the last one?

15
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:28,689
Who, Neela?

16
00:00:28,732 --> 00:00:29,860
She's terrific.

17
00:00:29,902 --> 00:00:32,272
She's even taught me
a thing or two.

18
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:34,279
I'm glad to hear her expertise

19
00:00:34,313 --> 00:00:36,250
doesn't end with <i>jumja</i> sticks.

20
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:38,689
No. She's a really good engi...

21
00:00:38,724 --> 00:00:40,125
Hold on.

22
00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:41,425
What?

23
00:00:41,465 --> 00:00:42,627
Well...

24
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,137
you're not thinking?

25
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,469
Well, Keiko!

26
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:48,381
Just keeping you
on your toes, O'Brien.

27
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,148
Oh, very funny.

28
00:00:50,187 --> 00:00:53,218
Be careful who you
share your <i>jumja</i> with.

29
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,598
Now, as we discussed
in yesterday's lesson

30
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:12,042
the wormhole was discovered
by Commander Sisko

31
00:01:12,077 --> 00:01:14,777
and Lieutenant Dax
earlier this year.

32
00:01:14,818 --> 00:01:18,726
Does anyone know what makes
this wormhole so unusual?

33
00:01:18,762 --> 00:01:20,630
Jake?

34
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:21,829
It's stable?

35
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:22,896
It's stable.

36
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:24,408
That's right, Jake.

37
00:01:24,443 --> 00:01:27,383
It's the first stable wormhole
known to exist...

38
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,958
Please, continue.

39
00:01:31,996 --> 00:01:34,298
A stable wormhole
is very important

40
00:01:34,336 --> 00:01:37,971
because it allows us to travel,
secure in the knowledge

41
00:01:38,012 --> 00:01:40,644
that neither end
will shift locations.

42
00:01:40,685 --> 00:01:45,129
Who knows why this wormhole
is stable?

43
00:01:45,163 --> 00:01:48,433
Because it was
artificially constructed.

44
00:01:48,472 --> 00:01:50,568
Commander Sisko
encountered the entities

45
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,707
who created the wormhole
when he went...

46
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,083
Excuse me.

47
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,584
By entities,
do you not mean the Prophets?

48
00:01:57,629 --> 00:02:01,070
Yes, on Bajor, the entities
are worshipped as Prophets.

49
00:02:01,104 --> 00:02:04,773
Our studies of the wormhole
have shown that it was formed

50
00:02:04,814 --> 00:02:07,720
by unique particles
we call "verterons"

51
00:02:07,755 --> 00:02:10,729
that are apparently
self-sustaining in nature.

52
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,529
This begins to explain

53
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:17,069
how a ship at impulse can safely
pass through without...

54
00:02:17,113 --> 00:02:19,107
Ships are safely guided
through the passage

55
00:02:19,151 --> 00:02:21,054
by the hands of the Prophets.

56
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,061
In a manner of speaking.

57
00:02:23,096 --> 00:02:26,502
Not, apparently,
in your manner of speaking.

58
00:02:26,537 --> 00:02:29,705
Perhaps we should discuss this
after class.

59
00:02:29,746 --> 00:02:30,908
Do you believe

60
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:33,421
the Celestial Temple
of the Prophets

61
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:35,289
exists within the passage?

62
00:02:35,327 --> 00:02:37,561
I respect
that the Bajoran people

63
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,092
believe that it does.

64
00:02:39,137 --> 00:02:41,837
But that's not what you teach.

65
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:43,108
No.

66
00:02:43,148 --> 00:02:45,986
I don't teach
Bajoran spiritual beliefs.

67
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:47,183
That's your job.

68
00:02:47,224 --> 00:02:50,221
Mine is to open
the children's minds to...

69
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:53,935
history, to literature,
to mathematics, to science.

70
00:02:53,975 --> 00:02:56,607
You are opening
the children's minds...

71
00:02:56,649 --> 00:02:57,845
to blasphemy

72
00:02:57,885 --> 00:03:00,483
and I cannot permit it
to continue.

73
00:05:02,642 --> 00:05:04,613
Sorry I couldn't
get here sooner.

74
00:05:04,648 --> 00:05:07,314
Another fusion reactor
went down.

75
00:05:07,355 --> 00:05:08,619
How's it going?

76
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:09,649
Done.

77
00:05:09,695 --> 00:05:11,028
Done?

78
00:05:11,065 --> 00:05:12,865
Did you remember
to re-initialize

79
00:05:12,903 --> 00:05:14,304
the isolinear coprocessor?

80
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,311
I did it exactly
like you showed me.

81
00:05:16,345 --> 00:05:17,439
Should I test it?

82
00:05:17,481 --> 00:05:18,450
Well, uh, let me.

83
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,885
You know us old folks.

84
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:21,413
We like to feel useful.

85
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:24,961
Not bad.

86
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:26,869
Not bad at all.

87
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:29,036
You keep this up,
I'll be out of a job.

88
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,312
I doubt that.

89
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,686
Let's close it up.

90
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:40,568
Not that one.

91
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:42,944
That's a security seal.

92
00:05:42,981 --> 00:05:45,647
You need an EJ7 interlock
to close it.

93
00:05:45,688 --> 00:05:47,318
EJ7?

94
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:49,763
Yeah. That's okay.
I have one here.

95
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:51,359
Bloody hell.

96
00:05:51,402 --> 00:05:54,102
What's wrong?

97
00:05:54,143 --> 00:05:56,877
Well, my EJ7 is missing.

98
00:05:56,917 --> 00:05:59,047
It was here yesterday.

99
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,155
Maybe you left it in Ops.

100
00:06:02,198 --> 00:06:03,828
No.

101
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:05,360
I...

102
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,742
I don't misplace my tools.

103
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:09,579
I'm not exactly surprised.

104
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:11,780
You knew this was
going to happen?

105
00:06:11,822 --> 00:06:15,024
A confrontation like this
was inevitable.

106
00:06:15,064 --> 00:06:16,226
Sometimes I wonder

107
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,433
if we'll ever find
the common ground we need

108
00:06:19,475 --> 00:06:22,540
to bring Bajor
into the Federation.

109
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,713
Major, would you join us?

110
00:06:26,695 --> 00:06:28,563
We've been talking
about an incident

111
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:29,795
this morning at school.

112
00:06:29,836 --> 00:06:30,862
I heard.

113
00:06:30,905 --> 00:06:32,135
Vedek Winn's been meeting

114
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:34,374
with some of the Bajoran
civilians about it.

115
00:06:34,414 --> 00:06:35,883
What do you know about her?

116
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:37,752
She's from an orthodox order.

117
00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:40,786
She has some support
to become the next Kai...

118
00:06:40,831 --> 00:06:42,164
probably not enough.

119
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:44,263
The question is,
how much support

120
00:06:44,307 --> 00:06:46,244
does she have on this station?

121
00:06:46,278 --> 00:06:47,474
She has mine.

122
00:06:47,515 --> 00:06:49,679
You can't possibly believe

123
00:06:49,721 --> 00:06:51,989
teaching the facts
about the wormhole

124
00:06:52,026 --> 00:06:53,325
amounts to blasphemy.

125
00:06:53,363 --> 00:06:55,334
I think some revisions
in the school curriculum

126
00:06:55,369 --> 00:06:56,668
might be appropriate.

127
00:06:56,706 --> 00:06:59,144
You teach a lot
of Bajoran children.

128
00:06:59,179 --> 00:07:02,153
I'm not going to let
a Bajoran spiritual leader

129
00:07:02,186 --> 00:07:04,385
dictate what can
or can't be taught

130
00:07:04,426 --> 00:07:05,622
in my classroom.

131
00:07:05,662 --> 00:07:08,636
Then maybe we need
two schools on this station...

132
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,402
one for the Bajoran children

133
00:07:10,442 --> 00:07:12,413
and another for the Federation.

134
00:07:12,447 --> 00:07:15,683
If we start separating Bajoran
and Federation interests...

135
00:07:15,721 --> 00:07:17,658
A lot of Bajoran and
Federation interests

136
00:07:17,693 --> 00:07:18,923
are separate, Commander.

137
00:07:18,963 --> 00:07:20,831
I've been telling
you that all along.

138
00:07:20,868 --> 00:07:22,463
Nobody's saying
that there can't be

139
00:07:22,506 --> 00:07:24,340
spiritual teaching
on the station, Major

140
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:25,710
but can't it be in addition

141
00:07:25,747 --> 00:07:28,447
to what's taught
in Mrs. O'Brien's classroom?

142
00:07:28,488 --> 00:07:29,855
But if she's teaching

143
00:07:29,892 --> 00:07:32,364
a fundamentally
different philosophy...

144
00:07:32,432 --> 00:07:34,460
I'm not teaching any philosophy.

145
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:36,668
What I'm trying to teach
is pure science.

146
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,374
Some might say pure science

147
00:07:38,447 --> 00:07:40,611
taught
without a spiritual context

148
00:07:40,653 --> 00:07:42,385
is a philosophy, Mrs. O'Brien.

149
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,984
My philosophy is

150
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:47,196
that there is room for all
philosophies on this station.

151
00:07:47,236 --> 00:07:49,970
Now, how do you suggest
that we deal with this?

152
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:55,246
I'm not sure you can.

153
00:08:15,744 --> 00:08:17,374
I can't tell you

154
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:20,651
how much I've looked forward
to this moment.

155
00:08:22,862 --> 00:08:26,965
I'm honored to meet
the Emissary to the Prophets.

156
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,309
If you'd let me know you
were coming, Vedek Winn

157
00:08:29,346 --> 00:08:30,872
I would have greeted you sooner.

158
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:34,551
I did not wish to bother you
with my insignificant visit.

159
00:08:34,593 --> 00:08:37,259
I'd hardly call it
insignificant.

160
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,293
Thank you, Emissary.

161
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:41,469
I wish you wouldn't
call me that.

162
00:08:41,544 --> 00:08:43,378
I'm Commander Sisko

163
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,182
or Benjamin, if you like.

164
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,488
But you are the Emissary.

165
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,828
Don't you know
the cherished place

166
00:08:49,865 --> 00:08:53,033
you have earned
in the Bajoran spiritual life?

167
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:55,513
I'm not sure I'm comfortable
in that role.

168
00:08:55,614 --> 00:08:59,249
The course the Prophets
choose for us

169
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,423
may not always be comfortable

170
00:09:02,466 --> 00:09:06,135
but we must follow it.

171
00:09:06,174 --> 00:09:07,974
May I?

172
00:09:14,998 --> 00:09:17,698
Still the disbeliever.

173
00:09:17,738 --> 00:09:20,074
I once asked Kai Opaka

174
00:09:20,111 --> 00:09:23,517
why a disbeliever was destined
to seek the Prophets

175
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,323
and she told me that one
must never look into the eyes

176
00:09:27,363 --> 00:09:29,231
of one's own gods.

177
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:32,106
I disagreed.

178
00:09:32,142 --> 00:09:37,521
I told her I would do anything
to look into their eyes.

179
00:09:37,557 --> 00:09:41,021
She suggested that I
sit in darkness for a day

180
00:09:41,065 --> 00:09:43,697
and quite properly so.

181
00:09:43,738 --> 00:09:47,441
She cannot be replaced,
and I miss her deeply.

182
00:09:47,481 --> 00:09:49,349
It's important to me
that we resolve

183
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:50,982
your problems with the school.

184
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:56,299
The Prophets have spoken to me
through the Orbs, Emissary.

185
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:00,612
I understand my duty
to defend the Bajoran faith.

186
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:05,594
The teacher has dishonored
the Celestial Temple.

187
00:10:05,629 --> 00:10:07,793
If she does not recant

188
00:10:07,835 --> 00:10:11,470
I cannot be responsible
for the consequences.

189
00:10:18,391 --> 00:10:21,695
This still seems like an awful
lot of trouble to go through

190
00:10:21,732 --> 00:10:22,860
to find one tool.

191
00:10:22,902 --> 00:10:24,896
With that interlock,
someone could access

192
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:27,379
every critical system
on the station.

193
00:10:27,414 --> 00:10:30,046
Chief, have you seen
Ensign Aquino recently?

194
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,523
No, now that you mention it.

195
00:10:31,558 --> 00:10:33,529
He didn't report for duty
this morning.

196
00:10:33,563 --> 00:10:35,625
The computer says
he's not on the station

197
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:36,762
but he didn't log out.

198
00:10:36,838 --> 00:10:38,672
Have you talked to Odo?

199
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,442
I guess I'd better.

200
00:10:40,481 --> 00:10:42,041
Scanners are ready.

201
00:10:42,086 --> 00:10:44,023
Computer, show location

202
00:10:44,057 --> 00:10:47,088
of any independent
tritanium sources.

203
00:10:47,132 --> 00:10:49,331
Level 3, Section 5.

204
00:10:49,371 --> 00:10:50,966
Oh, that's the tool locker.

205
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:54,040
I've been through everything
in there three times.

206
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,686
What's that?

207
00:10:57,726 --> 00:11:00,221
Looks like something
in a power conduit

208
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:01,964
on Level 12, Section 8.

209
00:11:02,004 --> 00:11:04,944
What would tritanium
be doing there?

210
00:11:04,978 --> 00:11:07,712
Computer, shut down
that conduit.

211
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:09,416
Reroute power flow.

212
00:11:09,456 --> 00:11:11,154
Conduit deactivated.

213
00:11:11,194 --> 00:11:12,356
Come on.

214
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,898
Over here, Chief.

215
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,052
That's tritanium
composite, all right.

216
00:11:25,097 --> 00:11:27,296
Looks like our
missing interlock.

217
00:11:27,336 --> 00:11:30,742
Must have been melted
by the conduit's plasma flow.

218
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:32,077
That still doesn't explain

219
00:11:32,116 --> 00:11:33,882
how it got here
in the first place.

220
00:11:34,956 --> 00:11:36,859
Hey...

221
00:11:36,894 --> 00:11:40,961
I'm picking up traces
of organic material.

222
00:11:41,005 --> 00:11:44,811
Whatever it was,
it's been pretty well cooked.

223
00:11:44,848 --> 00:11:46,682
Let's take a sample
to Dr. Bashir.

224
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,246
See what he can make of it.

225
00:11:57,214 --> 00:12:00,586
Ensign Aquino made a log entry
the night he disappeared

226
00:12:00,622 --> 00:12:04,257
about some sort of plasma flow
irregularity in the conduit.

227
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:06,533
He indicated
he was going to fix it.

228
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:07,802
So, it was an accident.

229
00:12:07,842 --> 00:12:09,209
Well, I guess so.

230
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:12,651
Bashir has confirmed
that the remains were human.

231
00:12:12,687 --> 00:12:14,487
I'm sure the DNA trace

232
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,499
will confirm that it was Aquino.

233
00:12:17,533 --> 00:12:19,333
I'll have one, please...

234
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,900
unless you're feeling
adventurous today.

235
00:12:21,978 --> 00:12:22,911
Sorry.

236
00:12:22,981 --> 00:12:24,507
We're all out.

237
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:25,713
What?

238
00:12:25,754 --> 00:12:27,418
What are all these?

239
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:30,091
These aren't for sale.

240
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:31,226
Not for sale, huh?

241
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:33,433
How would you like
a <i>jumja</i> stick up?

242
00:12:33,475 --> 00:12:34,535
Miles.

243
00:12:34,577 --> 00:12:35,671
Is there a problem?

244
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,682
Damn right there is!

245
00:12:36,716 --> 00:12:37,844
I don't have to sell

246
00:12:37,886 --> 00:12:40,724
anything to them
if I don't want to.

247
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,791
Why wouldn't you want
to sell to them?

248
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:45,269
Miles, can we go?

249
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,206
Let's go.

250
00:12:48,246 --> 00:12:49,306
Seek the Prophets.

251
00:12:49,349 --> 00:12:50,340
I'll seek you...

252
00:12:50,385 --> 00:12:51,718
Miles!

253
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:54,888
Seek them yourself.

254
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,163
Maybe you were right.

255
00:12:58,205 --> 00:13:00,108
Maybe we've no business here.

256
00:13:00,143 --> 00:13:02,307
I'll put in for a transfer,
and that'll...

257
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,150
No, I can't run away
from this now.

258
00:13:04,188 --> 00:13:05,657
...don't you all agree?

259
00:13:05,691 --> 00:13:07,525
What's this?

260
00:13:07,563 --> 00:13:11,403
If we abandon the Prophets
then everything we have...

261
00:13:12,977 --> 00:13:15,541
Here's Mrs. O'Brien now.

262
00:13:15,584 --> 00:13:16,848
Good morning.

263
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:18,915
Are you Mr. O'Brien?

264
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,258
That's right.

265
00:13:20,295 --> 00:13:21,821
A pleasure to meet you.

266
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,336
I've just been hearing

267
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,774
many wonderful things
about your wife

268
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,112
from the parents
of these children.

269
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,714
She apparently is
an excellent teacher.

270
00:13:30,756 --> 00:13:32,020
Yes, she is

271
00:13:32,126 --> 00:13:35,191
and she doesn't deserve
what you're doing to her.

272
00:13:35,234 --> 00:13:36,898
I feel your anger toward me

273
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:39,275
and I forgive you for it.

274
00:13:39,312 --> 00:13:41,476
Mrs. O'Brien

275
00:13:41,517 --> 00:13:45,391
if I've misjudged you,
I am terribly sorry.

276
00:13:45,428 --> 00:13:46,920
Have I?

277
00:13:46,965 --> 00:13:51,068
Is there a place in your school
for the Prophets?

278
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,081
No.

279
00:13:53,115 --> 00:13:54,175
I admire you

280
00:13:54,218 --> 00:13:56,850
for standing by your convictions

281
00:13:56,891 --> 00:13:59,523
even though I disagree
with them.

282
00:13:59,564 --> 00:14:02,663
Please believe me,
I want to find a way

283
00:14:02,706 --> 00:14:06,546
to allow these children
to stay in your school.

284
00:14:06,582 --> 00:14:08,850
I'm sure the children
and their parents

285
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,757
are happy to hear you say that.

286
00:14:10,793 --> 00:14:14,792
Let me be the one
to make the first concession.

287
00:14:14,838 --> 00:14:16,900
I will no longer request

288
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:21,319
that you teach anything
about the Celestial Temple.

289
00:14:21,354 --> 00:14:25,023
Just don't teach anything
about the wormhole at all.

290
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:26,090
Ignore it?

291
00:14:26,201 --> 00:14:27,363
Find other ways

292
00:14:27,404 --> 00:14:30,104
other things
to teach the children.

293
00:14:30,177 --> 00:14:32,741
And when we get
to theories of evolution

294
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:35,382
or creation of the universe...
what then?

295
00:14:35,424 --> 00:14:38,796
We'll face those issues
when we come to them.

296
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:39,893
I'm a teacher.

297
00:14:39,936 --> 00:14:41,303
My responsibility

298
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,280
is to expose my students
to knowledge

299
00:14:44,314 --> 00:14:46,114
not hide it from them.

300
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:47,587
The answer is no.

301
00:14:49,628 --> 00:14:52,500
I've tried to be reasonable.

302
00:15:20,494 --> 00:15:23,296
If Aquino turned off the conduit

303
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:25,967
to fix the relay,
why did it reactivate?

304
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:28,811
The Cardassians only equipped
those power conduits

305
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,753
with one flow regulator
per level.

306
00:15:30,788 --> 00:15:33,158
The computer
could have realigned it.

307
00:15:33,195 --> 00:15:35,599
When the power flow
was rerouted back

308
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,628
it could have caught him inside.

309
00:15:37,673 --> 00:15:39,644
You don't sound
entirely convinced.

310
00:15:39,678 --> 00:15:42,276
No, it all adds up, only...

311
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:43,982
Well, I don't know.

312
00:15:44,022 --> 00:15:46,494
Spit it out, Chief.

313
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,833
He borrowed one of my tools
without asking.

314
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:51,033
It was 4:00 in the morning.

315
00:15:51,074 --> 00:15:52,669
Maybe he didn't want
to disturb you.

316
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:54,682
The repairs could have waited.

317
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,219
He was a Starfleet engineer.

318
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,693
You don't take a Chief's
tools without asking.

319
00:15:58,728 --> 00:16:00,163
It's unheard of.

320
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:03,867
Are you suggesting it might
not have been an accident?

321
00:16:03,908 --> 00:16:06,312
I don't know
what I'm suggesting.

322
00:16:06,347 --> 00:16:07,977
I only know what I know.

323
00:16:08,018 --> 00:16:09,613
He should have asked.

324
00:16:09,656 --> 00:16:13,325
Constable, maybe you ought
to take a closer look into this.

325
00:16:13,365 --> 00:16:14,527
Dismissed.

326
00:16:15,872 --> 00:16:16,841
Hi.

327
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,344
Can I talk to you for a minute?

328
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:20,349
Sure.

329
00:16:20,383 --> 00:16:23,151
I heard about what happened
at school.

330
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,355
Did Mrs. O'Brien
call classes off?

331
00:16:25,396 --> 00:16:28,700
No, there was only me
and four other kids left

332
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,040
but she still kept
the school open.

333
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:34,211
She changed the lesson
to teach us about Galileo.

334
00:16:34,252 --> 00:16:37,054
Did you know that he was
tried by the Inquisition

335
00:16:37,094 --> 00:16:40,330
for teaching that the Earth
moved around the sun?

336
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:41,668
Tried and convicted.

337
00:16:41,705 --> 00:16:43,072
His books were burned.

338
00:16:43,109 --> 00:16:45,377
How could anyone be so stupid?

339
00:16:45,415 --> 00:16:47,045
It's easy to look back
seven centuries

340
00:16:47,086 --> 00:16:48,612
and judge what was
right and wrong.

341
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:50,183
But the same thing
is happening now

342
00:16:50,228 --> 00:16:52,757
with all this stuff
about the Celestial Temple

343
00:16:52,801 --> 00:16:53,770
and the wormhole.

344
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:54,772
It's dumb.

345
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,780
No, it's not.

346
00:16:57,814 --> 00:16:59,876
You've got to realize
something, Jake.

347
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,087
For over 50 years, the one thing
that allowed the Bajorans

348
00:17:03,127 --> 00:17:05,395
to survive
the Cardassian occupation

349
00:17:05,434 --> 00:17:06,494
was their faith.

350
00:17:06,537 --> 00:17:08,667
The Prophets
were their only source

351
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:10,008
of hope and courage.

352
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:11,640
But there were no Prophets.

353
00:17:11,683 --> 00:17:14,121
They were just aliens that
you found in the wormhole.

354
00:17:14,156 --> 00:17:17,255
To those aliens, the future
is no more difficult to see

355
00:17:17,298 --> 00:17:18,460
than the past.

356
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:20,735
Why shouldn't they be considered
Prophets?

357
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:22,334
Are you serious?

358
00:17:22,377 --> 00:17:23,437
My point is

359
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:26,010
it's a matter of interpretation.

360
00:17:26,054 --> 00:17:28,788
It may not be what you believe,
but that doesn't make it wrong.

361
00:17:28,895 --> 00:17:30,923
If you start to think that way

362
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,633
you'll be acting
just like Vedek Winn.

363
00:17:33,673 --> 00:17:35,701
Only from the other side.

364
00:17:35,745 --> 00:17:38,913
We can't afford
to think that way, Jake.

365
00:17:38,954 --> 00:17:42,418
We'd lose everything
we've worked for here.

366
00:17:42,463 --> 00:17:45,460
You're worried, aren't you?

367
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:52,681
What are you going to do?

368
00:17:52,723 --> 00:17:54,694
I'm not sure

369
00:17:54,728 --> 00:17:58,899
but I think I've got
to find some help.

370
00:18:26,978 --> 00:18:30,180
I'm sorry to keep you waiting,
Commander.

371
00:18:30,221 --> 00:18:31,919
Vedek Bareil?

372
00:18:33,596 --> 00:18:36,000
No need to pay tribute to me.

373
00:18:36,036 --> 00:18:38,007
Pay tribute?

374
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,408
I was just...

375
00:18:39,444 --> 00:18:42,042
Usually when I meet
one of Bajor's spiritual leaders

376
00:18:42,084 --> 00:18:44,579
the first thing they do
is grab my...

377
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,026
Ear?

378
00:18:46,062 --> 00:18:47,726
It's unpleasant, isn't it?

379
00:18:47,766 --> 00:18:50,295
I've been far too polite
to admit it.

380
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:55,479
I was five the first time one
of the monks grabbed my ear.

381
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:56,954
He was a stern old crow

382
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,462
who could virtually squeeze
the <i>pagh</i> out of you

383
00:18:59,496 --> 00:19:01,126
with his thumb and forefinger.

384
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:05,508
And as a chronic misbehaver,
I was his favorite victim.

385
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,675
I swore one of my life's goals

386
00:19:07,717 --> 00:19:10,748
would be to do away
with that archaic ritual.

387
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:13,492
You can count
on the Federation's support.

388
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,342
I hope you don't mind
if I do a little planting

389
00:19:18,378 --> 00:19:19,608
while we talk.

390
00:19:19,648 --> 00:19:24,525
All those hours of listening
to 112 vedeks talking at once

391
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:28,800
made me yearn for the sanctity
of my arboretum.

392
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:30,969
Is this yours?

393
00:19:31,012 --> 00:19:35,456
I began my service at the
monastery as the gardener.

394
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:38,555
I had no other ambition
but to grow

395
00:19:38,598 --> 00:19:42,974
the most lovely Feloran
bromeliads on the planet.

396
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:45,379
Unfortunately, the Prophets

397
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:48,720
did not allow me
that peaceful life.

398
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,667
I understand my friend,
Vedek Winn

399
00:19:54,706 --> 00:19:57,737
has brought her blessings
to your station.

400
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,480
I was hoping you might be able

401
00:20:00,522 --> 00:20:03,222
to arrange an audience
with the Assembly

402
00:20:03,262 --> 00:20:05,392
so I could discuss our school.

403
00:20:05,434 --> 00:20:06,835
Why me?

404
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:10,073
You are the leading candidate
to become the next Kai.

405
00:20:10,113 --> 00:20:13,019
Your ideology is quite different
than Vedek Winn's.

406
00:20:13,054 --> 00:20:16,119
You have been correctly
informed.

407
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:23,439
I'm sorry, Commander.

408
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,782
The Vedek Assembly
will not see you.

409
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,122
Why not?

410
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,566
Some fear you as the symbol
of a Federation

411
00:20:31,602 --> 00:20:33,300
they view as godless.

412
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:37,977
Some fear you as the Emissary
who walked with the Prophets.

413
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:42,156
And some fear you
because Vedek Winn told them to.

414
00:20:42,196 --> 00:20:46,002
Oh, we're all very good
at conjuring up enough fear

415
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:48,773
to justify
whatever we want to do.

416
00:20:48,813 --> 00:20:52,516
Today, I am only a Vedek.

417
00:20:52,556 --> 00:20:56,521
If the Prophets will it,
someday I may be Kai

418
00:20:56,566 --> 00:21:00,064
and I can be a better friend
to you then.

419
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:01,305
In other words

420
00:21:01,346 --> 00:21:04,343
being my friend now
might hurt your chances.

421
00:21:04,387 --> 00:21:08,022
The Prophets teach us patience.

422
00:21:08,064 --> 00:21:11,528
It appears they also
teach you politics.

423
00:21:14,045 --> 00:21:16,609
I'm sorry you made
this long trip

424
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:18,350
for nothing, Commander.

425
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:21,660
Please stay
and enjoy the gardens

426
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:24,068
as long as you like.

427
00:21:51,141 --> 00:21:52,610
Is it my imagination

428
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:54,742
or are we
a little shorthanded today?

429
00:21:54,784 --> 00:21:57,815
Three Bajoran crewmen
didn't report for duty.

430
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:00,297
They said
they weren't feeling well.

431
00:22:00,332 --> 00:22:03,066
Do you think
it's contagious, Major?

432
00:22:03,106 --> 00:22:05,077
It's too early to tell.

433
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:06,741
Are your people willing

434
00:22:06,782 --> 00:22:08,912
to throw away everything
we've accomplished

435
00:22:08,955 --> 00:22:10,424
during the past seven months?

436
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,452
Everyone knows
if the Federation leaves

437
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,264
the Cardassians will be back.

438
00:22:14,301 --> 00:22:15,565
With all due respect, Major

439
00:22:15,606 --> 00:22:17,942
protecting your borders
is not the primary reason

440
00:22:17,978 --> 00:22:21,715
the Federation is here,
and it's not why I'm here.

441
00:22:21,754 --> 00:22:24,454
I'm here to build a trusting
relationship with your people

442
00:22:24,495 --> 00:22:26,899
and I'd like to start feeling
that somebody...

443
00:22:26,935 --> 00:22:28,427
somebody on your side

444
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,067
is giving something back
to that effort.

445
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,742
I think I've given you all
the support I can, short of...

446
00:22:32,783 --> 00:22:34,252
It's not enough.

447
00:22:35,858 --> 00:22:37,590
I thought there was room

448
00:22:37,629 --> 00:22:40,329
for all philosophies
on this station.

449
00:22:40,403 --> 00:22:43,775
You tell
our sick Bajoran crewmen

450
00:22:43,812 --> 00:22:45,476
they better get well
immediately

451
00:22:45,516 --> 00:22:48,354
or they'll recover on the way
to their next assignment.

452
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:51,626
Yes, sir.

453
00:22:51,665 --> 00:22:55,106
Commander, Dr. Bashir has found
some new evidence

454
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:57,078
about Ensign Aquino
that you should see.

455
00:22:57,113 --> 00:23:00,246
Sir, I've finally managed
to reconstruct the victim's DNA.

456
00:23:00,288 --> 00:23:02,316
It's definitely Aquino,
but the power flow

457
00:23:02,426 --> 00:23:03,952
in the conduit didn't kill him.

458
00:23:03,998 --> 00:23:06,995
You see, the plasma disruption
in his cellular membranes

459
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,343
indicates that he was exposed
to a directed energy discharge

460
00:23:10,381 --> 00:23:13,183
before he was placed
in the conduit.

461
00:23:13,222 --> 00:23:14,954
A directed energy discharge?

462
00:23:14,992 --> 00:23:16,484
From a phaser?

463
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:19,732
Set to kill.

464
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:31,581
Could this murder be related
in any way

465
00:23:31,622 --> 00:23:33,616
to the tensions
over the school issue?

466
00:23:33,661 --> 00:23:35,929
If you're suggesting
he was killed by a Bajoran

467
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:37,733
just because he was
with the Federation...

468
00:23:37,838 --> 00:23:39,536
The analysis proves
that he was killed

469
00:23:39,577 --> 00:23:41,207
the night
before Vedek Winn arrived.

470
00:23:41,247 --> 00:23:43,047
There wasn't
any school issue yet.

471
00:23:43,085 --> 00:23:45,284
Any ideas about a motive?

472
00:23:47,129 --> 00:23:48,462
All right

473
00:23:48,499 --> 00:23:50,767
then let's start
at the beginning.

474
00:23:50,872 --> 00:23:53,710
Ensign Aquino goes
to repair a power conduit.

475
00:23:53,746 --> 00:23:54,908
One moment, Commander.

476
00:23:54,949 --> 00:23:56,509
I'm not convinced of that.

477
00:23:56,554 --> 00:23:57,716
But the log...

478
00:23:57,757 --> 00:23:59,523
It could have been altered
by our killer

479
00:23:59,562 --> 00:24:00,963
to cover his tracks.

480
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:03,733
I've checked the turbolift
records the night of the murder.

481
00:24:03,772 --> 00:24:05,743
Aquino did take a turbolift
to Level 3

482
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:08,718
but not to the power conduit
where he was found.

483
00:24:08,752 --> 00:24:10,312
Where did he go?

484
00:24:10,356 --> 00:24:12,122
Runabout Pad C.

485
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:13,528
A runabout?

486
00:24:13,564 --> 00:24:16,230
What was he doing in a runabout
at 4:00 in the morning?

487
00:24:16,271 --> 00:24:19,439
Apparently,
he was getting murdered.

488
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,799
Everything in the runabout
seems to be perfectly normal.

489
00:24:28,837 --> 00:24:30,899
It doesn't look
like the airlock systems

490
00:24:30,943 --> 00:24:32,173
have been tampered with.

491
00:24:32,213 --> 00:24:33,648
Let's run a level-1 diagnostic

492
00:24:33,683 --> 00:24:35,381
on the runabout's
computer interface...

493
00:24:35,421 --> 00:24:36,549
then we'll call it a day.

494
00:24:36,591 --> 00:24:38,653
I already have.
Everything's normal.

495
00:24:41,871 --> 00:24:45,039
I don't even know
what we're looking for.

496
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:47,243
If something
happened around here

497
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:49,723
it's been pretty
well covered up.

498
00:24:53,902 --> 00:24:55,998
Did you know him well?

499
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:57,408
Aquino?

500
00:24:57,445 --> 00:24:59,005
Oh, barely at all.

501
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:02,821
Just the "welcome aboard,
if you need anything" speech.

502
00:25:02,859 --> 00:25:04,021
You?

503
00:25:04,062 --> 00:25:06,226
Not really.

504
00:25:06,268 --> 00:25:08,239
Bajoran and Starfleet officers

505
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:11,372
don't really socialize
that much.

506
00:25:12,885 --> 00:25:14,252
How come?

507
00:25:14,289 --> 00:25:15,656
I don't know.

508
00:25:15,692 --> 00:25:18,860
I guess we just
keep to ourselves.

509
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,341
Well, you're not
like that with me.

510
00:25:22,376 --> 00:25:24,678
Well, you're not
like the others.

511
00:25:26,186 --> 00:25:27,553
You know.

512
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,188
You don't put on any airs.

513
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,896
You're just...

514
00:25:32,937 --> 00:25:34,874
nicer.

515
00:25:38,351 --> 00:25:40,322
Uh, look...

516
00:25:40,357 --> 00:25:42,955
I'll close up here.

517
00:25:44,801 --> 00:25:46,669
Why don't you take off.

518
00:25:46,706 --> 00:25:48,609
You sure?

519
00:25:48,645 --> 00:25:49,944
Yeah.

520
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,247
Yeah, I'm sure.

521
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,384
Good night.

522
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:06,181
On your toes, O'Brien.

523
00:26:16,651 --> 00:26:18,349
You were looking for me?

524
00:26:18,388 --> 00:26:19,584
Don't tell me...

525
00:26:19,624 --> 00:26:21,892
there's a Bajoran convention
on the station

526
00:26:21,931 --> 00:26:23,093
I didn't know about.

527
00:26:23,134 --> 00:26:24,296
Thanks, Odo.

528
00:26:24,337 --> 00:26:26,639
I need to call in
more dabo girls.

529
00:26:26,677 --> 00:26:27,976
It's not a convention.

530
00:26:28,014 --> 00:26:30,316
They're
from an orthodox spiritual order

531
00:26:30,352 --> 00:26:32,482
coming to support
Vedek Winn's efforts

532
00:26:32,525 --> 00:26:34,827
to keep the Bajoran
children out of school.

533
00:26:34,865 --> 00:26:36,665
Orthodox?
In that case

534
00:26:36,703 --> 00:26:39,505
I'll need twice as many
dabo girls.

535
00:26:39,543 --> 00:26:42,745
These spiritual types
love those dabo girls.

536
00:26:42,785 --> 00:26:46,157
This is not what I wanted
to talk to you about.

537
00:26:46,194 --> 00:26:51,573
What do you know about the
murder of Ensign Aquino?

538
00:26:51,607 --> 00:26:52,871
You wound me.

539
00:26:52,912 --> 00:26:55,784
All these years together,
I thought you knew me.

540
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:58,314
Odo, I am not a killer.

541
00:26:58,358 --> 00:27:00,796
No, but most
of your friends are.

542
00:27:00,832 --> 00:27:04,170
True, and I would gladly sell
one of them to you if I could

543
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:07,114
but unfortunately,
none of them have taken credit

544
00:27:07,148 --> 00:27:09,484
for the death
of the Starfleet officer.

545
00:27:09,521 --> 00:27:10,490
Sorry.

546
00:27:10,524 --> 00:27:11,686
Odo!

547
00:27:11,727 --> 00:27:14,427
Keep your ears open.

548
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:15,766
Are you kidding?

549
00:27:15,804 --> 00:27:18,744
That's the Seventh Rule
of Acquisition.

550
00:27:26,632 --> 00:27:29,629
This is
a security bypass module.

551
00:27:31,111 --> 00:27:33,481
You found it at Runabout Pad C?

552
00:27:33,516 --> 00:27:34,883
No, that's just it.

553
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:36,288
It wasn't at Pad C.

554
00:27:36,324 --> 00:27:38,488
That was as clean as a whistle.

555
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:42,096
Just to be safe, I ran a
diagnostic across the board.

556
00:27:42,139 --> 00:27:45,375
This showed up
at Runabout Pad A.

557
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:46,781
Pad A...

558
00:27:46,818 --> 00:27:49,382
Aquino never went
anywhere near Pad A.

559
00:27:49,425 --> 00:27:50,985
It doesn't make sense.

560
00:27:51,028 --> 00:27:55,267
On the contrary, it
makes perfect sense.

561
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:57,470
Ensign Aquino goes to Runabout C

562
00:27:57,512 --> 00:27:59,676
because some sensor
shows an anomaly

563
00:27:59,718 --> 00:28:01,416
in the security net there.

564
00:28:01,456 --> 00:28:04,224
He interrupts whoever
is tampering with it

565
00:28:04,264 --> 00:28:06,098
and is killed.

566
00:28:06,202 --> 00:28:09,108
The killer puts the body
in the conduit

567
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:11,579
and instead of going
back to Pad C

568
00:28:11,615 --> 00:28:14,783
which might be traced
with Aquino's turbolift log

569
00:28:14,823 --> 00:28:17,591
he changes his plan
and moves to Pad A.

570
00:28:17,631 --> 00:28:19,465
But what was the plan?

571
00:28:19,503 --> 00:28:20,995
Everything else seems normal.

572
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,672
I'd guess somebody wanted
to steal a runabout.

573
00:28:23,714 --> 00:28:25,274
We're not missing one.

574
00:28:25,318 --> 00:28:26,378
Huh. It's curious.

575
00:28:26,521 --> 00:28:30,486
He goes to a lot of trouble
to defeat the security net

576
00:28:30,531 --> 00:28:33,528
and then doesn't
go through with...

577
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,611
The school!

578
00:28:44,701 --> 00:28:46,296
Keiko!

579
00:28:48,177 --> 00:28:50,376
Keiko!

580
00:28:55,462 --> 00:28:56,863
Miles!

581
00:28:58,772 --> 00:29:00,743
Stand back, please!

582
00:29:00,777 --> 00:29:01,973
Clear the way!

583
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:16,338
What have you got?

584
00:29:16,376 --> 00:29:18,404
I'm reading traces
of cabrodine and infernite...

585
00:29:18,447 --> 00:29:20,942
common explosives,
both easily obtainable.

586
00:29:20,987 --> 00:29:23,687
Then we're looking
at a simple, homemade bomb.

587
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:34,511
Where is Mrs. O'Brien?

588
00:29:34,556 --> 00:29:36,116
Her husband took her home.

589
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,394
Was she hurt?
Was anyone hurt?

590
00:29:38,433 --> 00:29:40,301
No.

591
00:29:40,337 --> 00:29:42,605
The Prophets
have been kind today.

592
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:46,243
The Prophets had nothing to do
with what happened here today.

593
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:48,758
This was the work
of a disturbed and violent mind

594
00:29:48,792 --> 00:29:51,891
who listened to your voice,
not the Prophet's.

595
00:29:51,935 --> 00:29:54,407
Is the Emissary
holding me responsible

596
00:29:54,441 --> 00:29:57,506
for this act of terrorism?

597
00:29:57,548 --> 00:30:00,522
The Commander
of this station is.

598
00:30:00,556 --> 00:30:04,157
May the Prophets forgive you
for abandoning them.

599
00:30:04,199 --> 00:30:08,107
You claim the Prophets as
your personal constituency

600
00:30:08,142 --> 00:30:09,611
Vedek Winn.

601
00:30:09,647 --> 00:30:12,017
I'm not convinced
that's justified.

602
00:30:12,053 --> 00:30:14,024
Who do you speak for?

603
00:30:14,058 --> 00:30:16,930
An order that's barely
listened to in your Assembly.

604
00:30:16,966 --> 00:30:19,940
So you come here looking
for a more receptive audience.

605
00:30:19,973 --> 00:30:23,881
Is that what your friend,
Vedek Bareil, told you?

606
00:30:23,918 --> 00:30:26,720
He's as misguided as you are.

607
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:29,287
No, that's not fair.

608
00:30:29,331 --> 00:30:33,205
You are not simply misguided,
as I once thought.

609
00:30:33,242 --> 00:30:37,379
Now I see you want nothing less
than to destroy us.

610
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,390
Destroy you?

611
00:30:39,424 --> 00:30:41,988
You live without a soul,
Commander.

612
00:30:42,031 --> 00:30:45,768
You and your Federation exist
in a universe of darkness

613
00:30:45,841 --> 00:30:49,305
and you would drag us
in there with you.

614
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:52,917
But we will not go.

615
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:57,700
You have just made
your first mistake, Vedek.

616
00:30:57,739 --> 00:30:59,733
Have I?

617
00:30:59,777 --> 00:31:04,050
The Bajorans who have lived
with us on this station

618
00:31:04,088 --> 00:31:07,962
who have worked
with us for months

619
00:31:07,998 --> 00:31:11,735
who helped us move this station
to protect the wormhole

620
00:31:11,775 --> 00:31:16,082
who joined us to explore
the Gamma Quadrant

621
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:20,495
who have begun to build
the future of Bajor with us

622
00:31:20,531 --> 00:31:25,476
these people know that we are
neither the enemy nor the devil.

623
00:31:27,482 --> 00:31:29,954
We don't always agree.

624
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:33,794
We have some damn good fights,
in fact

625
00:31:33,832 --> 00:31:36,464
but we always come
away from them

626
00:31:36,506 --> 00:31:38,636
with a little better
understanding

627
00:31:38,678 --> 00:31:40,808
and appreciation of each other.

628
00:31:40,851 --> 00:31:43,483
You won't succeed here.

629
00:31:43,524 --> 00:31:45,654
The school will reopen.

630
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:47,792
And when your rhetoric gets old

631
00:31:47,835 --> 00:31:51,105
the Bajoran parents
will bring their children back.

632
00:31:52,514 --> 00:31:54,348
We'll see.

633
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:34,722
How is she, Chief?

634
00:32:34,757 --> 00:32:36,226
She's pretty shaken up, sir

635
00:32:36,261 --> 00:32:38,699
but she's planning
to hold classes tomorrow

636
00:32:38,734 --> 00:32:41,902
in one of the small cargo bays,
if that's okay.

637
00:32:41,942 --> 00:32:44,744
You tell her Jake
will be there on time.

638
00:32:44,783 --> 00:32:47,757
It will make her feel a lot
better to hear that, sir.

639
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,259
Anything new on Aquino?

640
00:32:49,295 --> 00:32:50,423
Yes, sir.

641
00:32:50,464 --> 00:32:53,928
I found a security bypass module
at Runabout Pad A.

642
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:56,103
It looks like somebody
might have wanted

643
00:32:56,146 --> 00:32:57,776
to steal a runabout.

644
00:32:57,816 --> 00:33:00,482
That's probably why Aquino went
there in the first place.

645
00:33:00,524 --> 00:33:03,726
I've put security seals
in place at all three pads

646
00:33:03,765 --> 00:33:05,895
and I'm checking
for any other anomalies.

647
00:33:05,937 --> 00:33:09,401
Benjamin, there's an incoming
transmission from Vedek Bareil

648
00:33:09,447 --> 00:33:11,942
on board a Bajoran transport.

649
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:15,618
On screen.

650
00:33:17,301 --> 00:33:20,103
Commander, I've decided

651
00:33:20,141 --> 00:33:23,445
to accept
your gracious invitation.

652
00:33:23,483 --> 00:33:24,782
Invitation?

653
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:28,694
You did invite me
to tour your facility.

654
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,199
Yes, yes, of course, Vedek.

655
00:33:30,234 --> 00:33:31,703
We'd be honored.

656
00:33:31,738 --> 00:33:34,472
Unfortunately, we have
some damage on our Promenade.

657
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,486
We won't have time to clean
up before you arrive.

658
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,788
Yes, I heard about it.

659
00:33:39,826 --> 00:33:42,800
Perhaps I can help you
clean it up.

660
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:45,135
That would be
very much appreciated.

661
00:33:45,173 --> 00:33:47,509
It's the least a friend can do.

662
00:33:47,546 --> 00:33:50,577
I look forward
to seeing you again.

663
00:34:09,034 --> 00:34:12,008
My dear, you should not be here.

664
00:34:12,042 --> 00:34:15,448
Vedek, they found out
about the runabout.

665
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:18,658
I see.

666
00:34:18,693 --> 00:34:22,533
I have no way to escape.

667
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:26,741
Then we must accept that
as the will of the Prophets.

668
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:31,292
But if I go through
with this now

669
00:34:31,326 --> 00:34:34,094
I will be caught and executed.

670
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:42,008
The sacrifices the Prophets
call on us to make

671
00:34:42,054 --> 00:34:46,053
are great sometimes, my dear

672
00:34:46,097 --> 00:34:52,011
but the rewards they give
will last through eternity.

673
00:34:57,561 --> 00:34:59,863
What the hell?

674
00:34:59,899 --> 00:35:04,070
Computer, identify subprogram
labeled "ANA"

675
00:35:04,111 --> 00:35:05,580
That file is protected

676
00:35:05,615 --> 00:35:07,586
by a personal
security access code.

677
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,089
On whose authority?

678
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:11,288
Chief of Operations,
Miles O'Brien.

679
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:13,632
Me?
I never saw this file before.

680
00:35:13,669 --> 00:35:15,138
Override command.

681
00:35:15,173 --> 00:35:16,939
Unable to comply.

682
00:35:16,978 --> 00:35:19,450
State security code
to release protection.

683
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:22,458
Lieutenant, I've got to do
a manual isolation

684
00:35:22,492 --> 00:35:23,961
of an anomalous file.

685
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:27,164
It's in the security field
subsystem labeled "ANA"

686
00:35:27,204 --> 00:35:28,973
That file is going to be

687
00:35:29,106 --> 00:35:31,442
protected by a series
of encryption sequences.

688
00:35:31,479 --> 00:35:33,279
I'll run an adaptive program.

689
00:35:33,317 --> 00:35:35,117
For once, we're lucky
we're working

690
00:35:35,156 --> 00:35:36,956
with a Cardassian computer.

691
00:35:36,994 --> 00:35:39,330
It shouldn't have any more
than seven sequences.

692
00:35:39,367 --> 00:35:41,338
Beginning decryption.

693
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:44,004
On-line.
Patched to subprogram ANA.

694
00:36:05,835 --> 00:36:09,402
Clear the way.
Clear the way.

695
00:36:09,445 --> 00:36:11,075
Make room.

696
00:36:11,115 --> 00:36:13,211
Move along, now.

697
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:15,123
Clear the way.

698
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:16,823
Clear the way, now.

699
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,013
Clear the way.

700
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,455
Please stand back.

701
00:36:27,491 --> 00:36:29,017
Clear the way, please.

702
00:36:29,129 --> 00:36:30,359
Thank you.

703
00:36:36,648 --> 00:36:38,619
That's it.

704
00:36:38,653 --> 00:36:45,193
Computer, access subprogram ANA,
Code 4100RLX.

705
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:47,709
Accessing.

706
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,908
Identify commands
within the file.

707
00:36:49,949 --> 00:36:51,817
Commands are
sequential overrides

708
00:36:51,854 --> 00:36:54,554
of security fields
approaching Runabout Pad A.

709
00:36:54,595 --> 00:36:56,064
The force fields.

710
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:58,697
Display sequences on screen.

711
00:37:02,081 --> 00:37:03,550
Right to the Promenade.

712
00:37:03,585 --> 00:37:08,052
Computer, run a level-3
sensor sweep of the Promenade.

713
00:37:08,096 --> 00:37:09,896
Report any anomalous reading.

714
00:37:09,934 --> 00:37:11,905
Working.

715
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:13,408
An escape route.

716
00:37:13,444 --> 00:37:15,415
Escape from what?

717
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:16,918
You got me.

718
00:37:16,952 --> 00:37:18,923
One anomalous reading detected.

719
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:20,450
Identify.

720
00:37:20,495 --> 00:37:23,936
A subspace relay was activated
in the security office

721
00:37:23,971 --> 00:37:25,942
nine minutes, seven seconds ago.

722
00:37:25,976 --> 00:37:27,947
Activated to do what?

723
00:37:27,981 --> 00:37:29,781
Unknown.
Insufficient data.

724
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,289
I'm going down there.

725
00:37:31,323 --> 00:37:33,795
I'll run a diagnostic
on the other security systems

726
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:36,132
and I'll call you
as soon as I have anything.

727
00:37:36,236 --> 00:37:38,070
Promenade.

728
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,642
I expected you sooner, Bareil.

729
00:37:51,676 --> 00:37:53,978
It seems our paths
have grown apart.

730
00:37:54,016 --> 00:37:56,990
Perhaps we can
bring them together again.

731
00:37:57,023 --> 00:37:59,495
I would like nothing
better than that.

732
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,433
Come with me to the school.

733
00:38:01,469 --> 00:38:03,440
Let us both show our commitment

734
00:38:03,474 --> 00:38:07,439
to a peaceful resolution
to this series of events.

735
00:38:07,484 --> 00:38:09,478
Of course.

736
00:38:46,084 --> 00:38:48,556
Computer, is the subspace
device integrated

737
00:38:48,591 --> 00:38:51,724
into the isolinear coprocessor?

738
00:38:51,766 --> 00:38:53,430
Confirmed.

739
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,911
O'Brien to Dax.

740
00:38:56,945 --> 00:38:58,414
Go ahead.

741
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:01,891
It's in
the isolinear coprocessor.

742
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:04,523
Didn't you just repair
that unit two days ago?

743
00:39:06,036 --> 00:39:07,734
Yes, I did.

744
00:39:09,078 --> 00:39:11,072
With Neela.

745
00:39:24,117 --> 00:39:27,091
Looking around at your faces

746
00:39:27,124 --> 00:39:29,562
I believe you feel
the shame I feel

747
00:39:29,597 --> 00:39:31,295
at this sight.

748
00:39:31,368 --> 00:39:33,305
No, it's got to be
the weapon detectors

749
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:34,842
in the Promenade.

750
00:39:34,878 --> 00:39:36,815
That's the only thing
those coprocessors

751
00:39:36,849 --> 00:39:38,182
could possibly affect.

752
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:40,919
All weapon detectors appear
to be functional, Chief.

753
00:39:42,431 --> 00:39:44,231
That's got to be it.

754
00:39:44,269 --> 00:39:46,240
She's good.
She's real good.

755
00:39:46,274 --> 00:39:49,578
She could make it look
like they're normal.

756
00:39:49,615 --> 00:39:52,589
But it's got to be
the weapon detectors.

757
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:54,355
O'Brien to Sisko.

758
00:39:54,395 --> 00:39:57,369
Once, our world was
a center of learning.

759
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,532
It attracted travelers
from many other worlds.

760
00:39:59,575 --> 00:40:00,703
Go ahead, Chief.

761
00:40:00,744 --> 00:40:03,718
I'm not entirely sure, but...

762
00:40:03,752 --> 00:40:04,982
I think the weapon detectors

763
00:40:05,022 --> 00:40:06,788
on the Promenade
may have been disabled.

764
00:40:06,827 --> 00:40:08,798
What do you mean,
you're not sure?

765
00:40:08,832 --> 00:40:11,327
I mean Neela
may have disabled them.

766
00:40:11,372 --> 00:40:12,671
Your assistant?

767
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:16,142
Yes, sir.

768
00:40:16,185 --> 00:40:19,216
...to reject violence
as a solution

769
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,732
to join hands with all peoples

770
00:40:21,766 --> 00:40:23,760
and begin to trust again.

771
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:07,408
No!

772
00:41:30,377 --> 00:41:32,348
The Prophets spoke.

773
00:41:32,382 --> 00:41:34,546
I answered their call.

774
00:41:34,655 --> 00:41:36,558
The Prophets spoke!

775
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:40,066
I answered their call!

776
00:41:50,062 --> 00:41:53,036
It was all
to get him here, wasn't it?

777
00:41:53,069 --> 00:41:55,371
The school, the protest,
the bombing...

778
00:41:55,408 --> 00:41:57,903
you knew that would get him
out of the monastery.

779
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:00,420
You did it all to kill him...

780
00:42:00,455 --> 00:42:03,725
to stop him from becoming Kai.

781
00:42:34,978 --> 00:42:37,450
Neela insists she acted alone...

782
00:42:37,484 --> 00:42:41,483
unless you want to consider
the Prophets coconspirators.

783
00:42:41,528 --> 00:42:43,830
She'll never tell us the truth.

784
00:42:43,868 --> 00:42:47,640
We'll never be able to prove
that Winn was involved.

785
00:42:47,678 --> 00:42:50,550
You okay?

786
00:42:50,585 --> 00:42:52,419
Okay?

787
00:42:52,456 --> 00:42:54,427
I've forgotten "okay."

788
00:42:54,462 --> 00:42:58,131
I haven't seen "okay"
in what seems like years.

789
00:42:58,171 --> 00:43:00,803
I was just sitting here
thinking

790
00:43:00,845 --> 00:43:03,785
last year at this time

791
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:08,959
I was fighting the Cardassians
in some nameless swamp.

792
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,472
And if you'd stopped by
and told me

793
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:14,308
that just one year later,
they'd be gone

794
00:43:14,347 --> 00:43:16,318
and I'd be wearing this uniform

795
00:43:16,353 --> 00:43:19,486
up here in charge
of protecting some wormhole...

796
00:43:19,527 --> 00:43:22,022
Protecting
your Celestial Temple.

797
00:43:24,741 --> 00:43:28,706
I envied Vedek Winn
because she was a true believer.

798
00:43:28,751 --> 00:43:32,854
I wanted my faith
to be as strong as hers.

799
00:43:32,895 --> 00:43:34,661
Maybe it is.

800
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:39,705
I've got a report
to put together for Starfleet.

801
00:43:39,746 --> 00:43:41,717
You ought to get some rest.

802
00:43:41,751 --> 00:43:43,585
I'd rather help you.

803
00:43:44,759 --> 00:43:46,389
Commander...

804
00:43:46,431 --> 00:43:50,568
I heard what you said
to Vedek Winn at the school.

805
00:43:50,607 --> 00:43:52,737
I just wanted you to know...

806
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:53,908
you were right...

807
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:56,582
what you said
about the Bajorans...

808
00:43:56,623 --> 00:43:58,925
at least about me.

809
00:43:58,963 --> 00:44:01,903
I don't think that you're...

810
00:44:01,937 --> 00:44:03,931
the devil.

811
00:44:05,413 --> 00:44:08,785
Maybe we have made
some progress after all.
