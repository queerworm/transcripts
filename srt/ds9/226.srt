1
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:09,426
(<i> door opens</i> )

2
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,138
Hey, Jake.

3
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,723
What's all this?

4
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,224
My science project.

5
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,226
I'm growing Bajoran
katterpods to find out

6
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:20,604
which hybrid yields
the biggest root.

7
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:23,858
That's it? You're just
going to watch it grow?

8
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:25,359
Yeah. Pretty neat, huh?

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,110
Hmm. Not bad.

10
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,323
But don't you think
it's a little low-tech?

11
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:34,743
I'm a low-tech
kind of guy, Dad.

12
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,704
I still think
you can do something

13
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,288
a little more challenging.

14
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,667
If you could do any
science project you wanted to

15
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,878
anything at all,
what would it be?

16
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,131
Learn how to pilot a runabout?

17
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:52,219
Well, that's not exactly
a science project, is it?

18
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:55,430
Second choice.

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,100
Visit the Gamma Quadrant?

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,895
And what would you do
when you got there?

21
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:03,522
I don't know. I...

22
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,482
I could do
a planetary survey.

23
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,859
Not bad.

24
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,612
All right, let's do it.

25
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,364
Really?

26
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:14,700
It'll be like a vacation,
a<i> working</i> vacation.

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,660
That's great!
Thanks, Dad.

28
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,829
I'll bet we'll have
a great time.

29
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,080
I know we will.

30
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:25,586
KIRA:
Let's see.

31
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,880
We have a Bolian freighter
due in day after tomorrow.

32
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,924
We'll be outfitting
another group of settlers

33
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:31,926
leaving for New Bajor.

34
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:34,720
You know, I heard their
new irrigation system

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,930
is really something to see.

36
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,222
When you get to
the Gamma Quadrant

37
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,265
you ought to
take a look.

38
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,683
Not this trip.

39
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:42,519
I really want to spend
some time alone with Jake.

40
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,564
When's the<i> Odyssey</i> due back
from the Cardassian border?

41
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,399
Three days.

42
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,986
It's a shame I'll have to miss
your reunion with Captain Keogh.

43
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:55,115
Don't you find him
just a little arrogant?

44
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,701
Funny... he said
the same thing about you.

45
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,745
Did he?

46
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,748
O'BRIEN:
Commander,
your son's here to see you.

47
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,291
Send him in.

48
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,961
He's really looking
forward to this trip.

49
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,587
Dad, guess what?

50
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:10,297
I was talking to Nog

51
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,007
and it turns out
he's having trouble

52
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,634
coming up with a
science project

53
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,135
so I told him he
could be my partner.

54
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,347
We can finish
this up later.

55
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,016
Partner?

56
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:24,019
We asked Mrs. O'Brien,
and she said it would be okay

57
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:26,814
so I invited Nog to come
with us to the Gamma Quadrant.

58
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,942
Now, hold on a second, Jake-o.

59
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:31,693
Dad, if Nog doesn't get
a good grade

60
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:32,820
on this science project

61
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,072
he's going to drop out
of school.

62
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,449
And I can't let
that happen.

63
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,119
Maybe he can help
you analyze the
survey information

64
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:41,495
when we get back.

65
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,080
That's not enough.

66
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,624
Mrs. O'Brien said he'd
have to be an equal partner.

67
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,668
Come on, Dad.

68
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,422
He's my friend.

69
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,841
I have to help him.

70
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,262
(<i> sighs</i> )

71
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:05,435
Morn, you've been
sitting here all day

72
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,228
staring at the same drink.

73
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,856
Talk to me.

74
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,398
I want to help.

75
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,317
I'm not just
your bartender

76
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,861
I'm your friend.

77
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:17,031
Whatever's wrong,
I'm here for you.

78
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:18,699
Hold that thought.

79
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,408
Well, uh, what did he say?

80
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,077
What did who say?

81
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,913
Commander Sisko--
about my idea.

82
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,999
You mean using the monitors

83
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,668
throughout the station
to sell merchandise?

84
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,378
Stop torturing me, Odo.

85
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,671
Tell me what he said.

86
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,297
Guess.

87
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,674
He said yes.

88
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,467
Guess again.

89
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,260
It would triple
my profits.

90
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,804
How could he refuse?

91
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,639
Maybe it's because
he doesn't like you.

92
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,432
Don't be ridiculous.

93
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,226
Major Kira is the one
that doesn't like me.

94
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,228
Sisko...
Doesn't like you either.

95
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,479
What'd I ever do
to him?

96
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,272
Oh, I could think of
one or two things.

97
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,983
Oh, one or two things,
that's nothing.

98
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,986
So, do you think
there's any way I
can change his mind?

99
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,696
Ha!

100
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:58,906
(<i> mocking laughter</i> )

101
00:03:58,906 --> 00:03:59,907
Uncle Quark?

102
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,408
Not now.

103
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,993
I just wanted
to tell you

104
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,494
I'm not going
to be able to
work my shift

105
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,704
for the next
couple of days.

106
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:06,955
Why not?

107
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,249
I-I'm going
to the Gamma Quadrant

108
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,959
with Jake and his father.

109
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,837
You're going
to the Gamma Quadrant

110
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,839
with Commander Sisko.

111
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,510
How lucky for you.

112
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,807
(<i> sighs</i> )

113
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,928
Oh, I always wanted to see

114
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,972
what the cockpit
of a runabout looked like.

115
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,474
Hey, how do you fire
the phasers?

116
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,767
Nog, you promised.

117
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,561
Oh, I wasn't going
to touch anything.

118
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,897
Why don't the two of you
stow our gear away in the back

119
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,523
while I go through prelaunch?

120
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,359
I'll do it.

121
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,987
I'll be right there.

122
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,739
"Fire the phasers"?

123
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,115
He was just kidding.

124
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,658
Look, Dad, I know

125
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,244
this isn't exactly
the trip you planned on

126
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,495
but you'll see--
Nog's a great guy.

127
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,373
I'm sure he is.
I was just hoping
that you and I

128
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:55,832
could spend
this time together.

129
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,209
We will. Don't worry.

130
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,253
You won't even
know Nog's along.

131
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,713
This'll be a great
trip, you'll see.

132
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,340
QUARK:
Ah, there you are.

133
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,966
Where do I put my bags?

134
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,010
Uncle Quark,
what are you
doing here?

135
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,346
What does it look like?
I'm going with you.

136
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,847
Since when?

137
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,683
Really, Commander,
you don't expect my nephew

138
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,977
to go all the way
to the Gamma Quadrant

139
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,687
without proper
supervision?

140
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:20,690
No offense--

141
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,359
some of my best friends
are humans--

142
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:26,405
but my brother, Rom,
isn't as liberal as I am.

143
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:28,489
Let's face it--
he's never been comfortable

144
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,409
about Nog's friendship
with your son.

145
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,411
You can tell Rom not to worry.

146
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,704
I'll take good care of the boy

147
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,331
and I promise I won't try

148
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,917
to corrupt him
with my human values.

149
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,501
I know that

150
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:44,172
but Rom is convinced all humans
look down upon Ferengi

151
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,800
and by allowing me
to come on this trip

152
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,927
you can help prove him wrong.

153
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,012
He is wrong, isn't he?

154
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,849
Dad, please.

155
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,519
(<i> chuckles wryly</i> )

156
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,854
All right.

157
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,399
Let's get going
before anyone else shows up.

158
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,401
Thanks, Dad, thanks.

159
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,819
Whoo-hoo.

160
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,503
JAKE:
This place is great.

161
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,672
SISKO:
Our preliminary
surveys suggest

162
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,132
it's a lot like Earth

163
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,176
during the early
Devonian period--

164
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:32,012
a lot of plant life,
fish, some insects

165
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,473
but no predators
or large animals.

166
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:35,932
Pretty, isn't it?

167
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,725
I don't see what's
so pretty about it.

168
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,395
NOG:
I think they mean
the trees and stuff.

169
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:41,771
Quark, this is
as close to paradise

170
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,315
as you're going to get.

171
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,484
All you need to do is to allow
yourself to see it.

172
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:47,277
I'll tell you
what I see.

173
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:51,281
In two words--
exploitable resources.

174
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:54,034
I suppose you want to
cut down all these trees

175
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,077
and start strip mining
the entire planet.

176
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,497
As a wise man once wrote

177
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:02,459
"Nature decays, but
latinum lasts forever."

178
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,128
Rule of Acquisition
Number 102.

179
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,588
Good lad.

180
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,008
Nog, I have some ointment
in one of my bags. Get it.

181
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,343
What's the problem?

182
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,803
Oh, I get a mild
reaction now and then.

183
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,638
SISKO:
To what?

184
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,224
Nature.

185
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,599
Perhaps you'd be
more comfortable

186
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,600
sleeping
on the runabout.

187
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,436
And miss all the fun?

188
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,355
Never.

189
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,815
Besides, I'm really
looking forward

190
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,693
to our getting to
know each other<i> better.</i>

191
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:45,335
Ah, that's much better.

192
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,215
Now, if it only wasn't so hot.

193
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,050
I hadn't noticed.

194
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,302
It isn't the heat so much

195
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,930
as the humidity
and the insects,

196
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,183
the stench of
these flowers.

197
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,394
I'm glad we could
talk like this.

198
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:06,356
There's nothing like
facing the wilderness
to bring people closer.

199
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,733
The answer
is still no, Quark.

200
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,277
No? No to what?

201
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,028
I'm not going to allow you
to sell merchandise

202
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,905
over the station's monitors.

203
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,240
Why not?

204
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,908
It's a brilliant idea.

205
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,410
With my connections

206
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,703
I could offer
a whole range
of merchandise

207
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,790
which normally couldn't
be acquired in this sector.

208
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,958
Such as?

209
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,000

Bolian crystalsteel...

214
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,426
And with my low overhead

215
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,637
I could offer these items
at a significant discount.

216
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,972
(<i> inhales</i> )

217
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:43,017
Quark, you're wasting
your time and mine.

218
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,519
Ah, ah, ah...

219
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,354
Did I mention
I was going to donate

220
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,274
two percent of my net profits
to the Bajoran Fund for Orphans?

(<i> inhales</i> )

222
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,360
Three percent?

(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

224
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,324
So, how's it going?

225
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,951
The atmosphere
is 77% nitrogen

226
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,496
21% oxygen
and 2% carbon dioxide.

227
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:05,415
The water contains
traces of copper, nickel

228
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,208
and a little
birythium.

229
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,876
You're showing a
little lead there, too.

230
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,128
That's from
the surrounding soil

231
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,212
but we think
it's localized.

232
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,506
We're going to check

233
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:14,174
other water sources,
just to be sure.

234
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,592
Why not wait until tomorrow?

235
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,010
I was just about
to start dinner.

236
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:17,969

237
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,012
How did you know?

238
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,013
Great!

239
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,139
Jambawhat?

240
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,516
You're going
to love it.

241
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,851
The two of you did
good work today.

242
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,230
Yes!

243
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,696
Anyone want
some more?
Not me.

244
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:40,241
Oh, me neither, Commander,
but it was very good.

245
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:43,537
You know, I think
I'm developing a taste
for human food.

246
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,121
Quark?

247
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:50,043
I still say there's
some dirt in the sauce.

248
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,045
And these bugs.

249
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,296
Look at this.

250
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,256
They get into everything.

251
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,966
It's disgusting.

252
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,511
I thought the Ferengis
liked eating bugs.

253
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:04,432
Only certain bugs--
Ferengi bugs.

254
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:08,853
Nog, get some more ointment
for the back of my neck.

255
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,771
Yes, Uncle.

256
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,320
Better get
a good night's sleep.

257
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,406
You have another
big day tomorrow.

258
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:22,492
Yeah, I want to
start cataloging
the plant life

259
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,452
first thing
in the morning.

260

You know what

261
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,582
Hmm.

262
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:31,792
The camping trip we took
on Itamish III.

263
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,879
I don't think
I remember you,
me and Mom

more fun together.

00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,841
Hmm.

266
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,511
Isn't that where I taught
you how to water ski?

267
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,762
Mom taught me
how to water ski.

268
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:47,517
Yes. She always was
the graceful one.

269

You know, Jake...

00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,444

There aren't
any wild animals

just insects and plants.

Maybe they were attacked
by a vicious tree.

Listen, we can't run away
just 'cause we're scared.

Hey, who said anything
about being scared?

341
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,345
I just thought the runabout
would be a good place

00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,972
to, uh, to plan our next move.

343
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,891
There's nothing
to plan.

344
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:15,975
My dad never would
have left here

345
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,518
without telling me first.

346
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,729
Not unless he was in
some sort of trouble.

347
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,940
We can track him
with the tricorder.

00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,461
This is your fault.

358
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,505
They were after you,
not us.

00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,340
Why don't you say
something to them?

00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,342
Tell them you've
never seen us before.

361
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,262
We have nothing
to do with her!

362
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,140
This is a misunderstanding!
Quark...

363
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,185
I have the right
to express my opinion.

364
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,646
I'm about to put my fist
in your opinion.

365
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,314
You don't scare me.

366
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,149
And you want to know why
you don't scare me?

367
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,818
Because I'm already
more scared

368
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,361
than I've ever been
in my life.

369
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,779
You're not
helping anything.

370
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,531
I'm not helping anything?

371
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:15,284
I don't see you coming up
with any ideas. Or<i> her.</i>

372
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,036
If she wants to
help us, she will.

373
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,331
Right now I'd say she's even
more scared than you are.

374
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,542
Believe me, she's not.

375
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,548
She's obviously
been running

376
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,341
from these people
for a while.

377
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:33,636
She's probably
been through a lot.

378
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,055
She doesn't know who we are
or what we're about.

379
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,558
(<i> sighs</i> ) I just hope
that Jake and Nog

380
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,434
are smart enough
to stay out of sight

381
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,895
until help gets here.

382
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:44,022
Trust me, I didn't raise
my nephew to be a fool.

383
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:46,900
He'll find the nearest dark
hole and climb into it.

384
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,693
I'm not so sure about Jake.

385
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,738
If I know him,
he'll be looking for us.

386
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,698
Don't they teach you
how to neutralize

387
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,700
security fields
in Starfleet?

388
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,788
I've never seen anything
like this before.

389
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,164
It seems to be
generated by...

390
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,583
Don't.

391
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,710
The security barrier
will kill you.

392
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,629
Thanks for
the warning.

393
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,798
I have no wish
to see you hurt.

394
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,425
A lovely sentiment.

395
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,677
(<i> hisses</i> )

396
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,933
How did you know

397
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,518
that the security
barrier is lethal?

398
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,479
Because everything about
the Jem'Hadar is lethal.

399
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,900
Anything you could tell me
about them might be helpful.

400
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,571
Are you saying you've never
heard of the Jem'Hadar?

401
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:37,533
Oh, we're not
from around here.

402
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,786
My name is Benjamin Sisko.

403
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,914
I'm from the United Federation
of Planets.

404
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:45,875
We came through
a wormhole to get here.

405
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,753
Our home is thousands
of light years away.

406
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,797
My name is Eris.

407
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,758
I'm glad to meet you...

408
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,051
Eris.

409
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,103
That's Quark.

410
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,274
Tell me about the Jem'Hadar.

411
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,193
They are the most feared
soldiers in the Dominion.

412
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,194
QUARK:
The Dominion?

413
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,738
The Ferengi have been trying

414
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,865
to open up trade negotiations
with the Dominion

415
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,241
for almost a year now.

416
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,160
We've never heard
of the Jem'Hadar.

417
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,038
Then you've been fortunate.

418
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:27,333
Negotiations with the Dominion
can be a dangerous thing.

419
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,336
If it's so dangerous, why would
anyone do business with them?

420
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:35,382
The Dominion decides that you
have something that they want

421
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:39,846
and then they come and take it
by negotiation or by force.

422
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,640
Believe me,
I know.

423
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,226
I've seen it happen
on my own world.

424
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:49,814
Kurill Prime was offered entry
into the Dominion.

425
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:52,942
They thought
our telekinetic powers would be

426
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,360
useful to them.

427
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,862
Back there in the camp--

428
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,072
that's what you used
to knock me down.

429
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:04,662
When Kurill refused
the Dominion's offer

430
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,831
they sent in the Jem'Hadar.

431
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,625
They destroyed
our communication center

432
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,502
they executed our leaders

433
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,713
and before we realized it

434
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,799
they had seized control
of the entire planet.

435
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,509
How did you manage to escape?

436
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,260
I was on a
freighter

437
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,222
going home
when the attack occurred.

438
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,892
We fled, but they came after us.

439
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,520
Why?

440
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:33,399
My mother was an
outspoken opponent

441
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,193
of the Dominion.

442
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:38,071
I guess they wanted to make
an example of my family.

443
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,239
That thing they put
around your neck...

444
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,533
It suppresses
my telekinetic abilities.

445
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,077
Without it,
I might be able

446
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,495
to break though
the security barrier.

447
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,498
Then we'll just have to find
a way to get this collar off.

448
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:53,127
Well, even if we get past
the barrier...

449
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:56,047
no one ever escapes
from the Jem'Hadar.

450
00:20:56,047 --> 00:21:00,134
Luckily for us, they seem
as sure about that as you do.

451
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:01,886
Look around you.

452
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,846
They placed
the three of us

453
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:06,099
in the same
containment field.

454
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,976
I've never seen more
than four guards on duty

455
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,603
at any one time.

456
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,146
As far as I can tell

457
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,523
there's only this single
containment field

458
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,942
between us and freedom.

459
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,651
They're overconfident

460
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:20,654
and that's what's going
to help us get out of here.

461
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,823
Maybe if I can pry off
that casing

462
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,867
I can get at
the locking mechanism.

463
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,286
May I?

464
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,788
Of course.

465
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,334
You sure you know how
to read that thing?

466
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,879
Pretty sure.
Pretty sure?

467
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,548
We've been walking for hours,
and you're only pretty sure?

468
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,134
Would you
be quiet?

469
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:43,010
I'm picking up some kind
of humanoid life-forms.

470
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,431
NOG:
I don't know
who they are

471
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,349
but they don't
look friendly.

472
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,185
I wish we could
get closer.

473
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:54,272
I don't think they'll look
any friendlier close up.

474
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:04,406
Hello?

475
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:08,953
I know someone must be
listening to me out there.

476
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,496
If we escape

477
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,165
do we have to take
him with us?

478
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:13,415
He's not so bad.

479
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,875
Whoever's in charge

480
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:18,171
you're missing a very
lucrative opportunity...

481
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,464
Doesn't he realize he's not
accomplishing anything?

482
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,632
Don't be so sure.

483
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,050
We need to know

484
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,136
what the Jem'Hadar
plan to do with us

485
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,887
which means we need
to get their attention.

486
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,472
And if there's
one thing I know...

487
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:31,309
GUARD:
That's enough.

488
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:34,603
...it's that Quark
is hard to ignore.

489
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,031
I'm Commander
Benjamin Sisko

490
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,283
of the United Federation
of Planets.

491
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,869
I want to know why we are being
held here.

492
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,745
That's not my concern.

493
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,664
Then why won't you let us go?

494
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:56,125
Because the Founders
don't want you released.

495
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,044
And who are the Founders?

496
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,504
That's not<i> your</i> concern.

497
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,922
This isn't getting
us anywhere.

498
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,132
Commander, allow me.

499
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,218
How would you like
a thousand cases

500
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:06,969
of tulaberry wine?

501
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:08,428
(<i> gasping</i> )

502
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,472
Don't bother, Commander.

503
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:14,310
I'm not going to do
any permanent damage.

504
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,270
(<i> groaning</i> )

505
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,941
If the Founders are the
ones who give the orders

506
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,400
I want to meet them.

507
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,111
Those aren't my orders.

508
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,572
He can't take you
to the Founders

509
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,823
because they don't exist.

510
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,033
They're a myth.

511
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,450
The Founders exist.

512
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,452
They created the Dominion.

513
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,372
And the Jem'Hadar

514
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:36,123
are their servants?

515
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,833
(<i> Quark moaning</i> )

516
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:44,006
A Ferengi and a human.

517
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,675
I was hoping
the first race I'd meet

518
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,053
from the other side
of the anomaly

519
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,138
would be the Klingons.

520
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,182
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

521
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:55,851
It's too late for apologies.

522
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,145
The Dominion will
no longer stand by

523
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:02,233
and allow ships from your side
to violate our territory.

524
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,406
I hear the Klingons
are effective warriors.

525
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:13,077
What's that weapon they're
so fond of... the<i> bat'leth?</i>

526
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:16,080
I am not interested
in discussing the Klingons.

527
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,873
All right.

528
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,376
Then what about the Cardassians?

529
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,962
Are you satisfied
with the treaty

530
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:25,131
your Federation made with them?

531
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,425
It seems a tactical error.

532
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:31,095
How do you know so much
about our side of the galaxy?

533
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,722
We gain more knowledge every day

534
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,267
and now we have you
to help us learn more.

535
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:39,395
I don't plan
on telling you anything.

536
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:42,815
I won't be the one asking
the questions.

537
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,524
Who will?

538
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:47,069
I was really hoping
to meet a Klingon.

539
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:04,586
Well, now that
we're all friends

540
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,755
I feel so much better.

541
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,320
I hope this works.

542
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,904
You wanted a plan,
I came up with a plan.

543
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,448
Now let me concentrate.

544
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,741
Computer, scan the region
around our base camp

545
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,410
for human and
Ferengi life-signs.

546
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,038
COMPUTER:
One human
and one Ferengi located.

547
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,122
That's them.

548
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,832
I told you
this would work.

549
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:44,043
Computer, lock onto
the two life-forms

550
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,252
and beam them up.

551
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,087
COMPUTER:
Unable to comply.

552
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:50,049
Subjects are located inside
a spatial distortion field.

553
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,259
I knew it couldn't be
that easy.

554
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,970
Maybe we'd better go back
to the station for help.

555
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,514
Good idea.

556
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:59,475
Computer, fly us back
to the station.

557
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,601
Please restate command.

558
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,979
Computer,
disengage autopilot

559
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:07,066
and lay in a course
back to the wormhole.

560
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,985
Enter authorization code.

561
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,569
Go ahead.

562
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:13,447
What are you
waiting for?

563
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,282
I don't know the
authorization code!

564
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,826
Vessel approaching
from the planet's surface

565
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,413
bearing 173 mark 281.

566
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:23,040
Computer, evasive maneuvers!

567
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,833
Fire phasers!

568
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,420
Launch torpedoes...
and escape pods!

569
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,962
(<i> shrieking</i> )

570
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,923
Computer, display

571
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,716
the approaching ship
on the monitor.

572
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:35,928
Computer, where
did the ship go?

573
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:40,516
The vessel has entered warp
bearing 171 mark 259.

574
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,600
(<i> sighing with relief</i> )

575
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,895
Oh, maybe they
didn't see us.

576
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:48,232
Maybe we're not
what they're after.

577
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:49,983
So, what do we do now?

578
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,528
We'll have to shut
down the autopilot.

579
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,405
How do we do that?!

580
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:56,323
I guess we'll find out
how much I learned

581
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,367
working for Chief O'Brien.

582
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:12,339
Lieutenant, what's the ETA
on the<i> Odyssey?</i>

583
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,007
They're due
in eight hours.

584
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,509
I'm reading
elevated neutrino levels

585
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:16,510
from the wormhole.

586
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,220
On screen.

587
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:23,601
Hail them,
Lieutenant.

588
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:24,810
They're not
answering.

589
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,937
Shields up.
Go to Yellow Alert.

590
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:29,273
O'BRIEN:
Computer, intruder in Ops.

591
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:31,150
Activate a level-3
containment field.

592
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,989
I'm Major Kira Nerys,
First Officer of this station.

593
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,657
You'll have to excuse
the containment field

594
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:41,785
but, around here, it's customary

595
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,996
to identify yourself
before transporting

596
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,872
into someone else's
command center.

597
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:48,666
I'm Third Talak'talan
of the Jem'Hadar.

598
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,752
I'm here to inform you
that your Commander

599
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,297
has been detained
for questioning by the Dominion.

600
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:55,174
Detained?
For how long?

601
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:56,634
Indefinitely.

602
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:58,802
Commander Sisko will serve
as an example

603
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:02,598
of what happens to anyone who
interferes with the Dominion.

604
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,724
What kind of interference are
you talking about?

605
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:07,769
Coming through the anomaly
is interference enough.

606
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,272
Unless you wish to continue
to offend the Dominion

607
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:13,150
I suggest you stay
on your side of the galaxy.

608
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,027
DAX:
You're making a
mistake if you think

609
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,029
that detaining Commander Sisko
will stop us

610
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,531
from exploring
the Gamma Quadrant.

611
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,326
We anticipated that response.

612
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:27,122
Security team to Ops.

613
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,749
Here's a list of vessels
we've destroyed

614
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:32,127
for violating our territory.

615
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,137
Where'd you get this datapadd?

616
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:46,308
From the Bajoran colony
on<i> our</i> side of the anomaly.

617
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:48,310
You should be proud.

618
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,647
I hear they fought well
for a spiritual people.

619
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:54,233
I hope we won't
have to repeat

620
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,984
this lesson.

621
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,237
Chief, lock
a tractor beam

622
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,863
onto his ship.

623
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:00,947
Acknowledged.

624
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,491
I can't establish a lock, Major.

625
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:04,201
They must have
some kind of deflectors

626
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:05,285
we haven't seen before.

627
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,120
They've entered the wormhole.

628
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,288
We've lost them.

629
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,173
Got it.

630
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:21,510
It looks like some kind
of multiple-locking system.

631
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,221
Even if I can break through
the security barrier

632
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:26,139
how do you plan to
get off the planet?

633
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,516
We'll try to find my son.

634
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,560
We'll use his communicator

635
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,396
to signal my ship and
transport us off the surface.

636
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,523
And then what?

637
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:39,361
You're welcome to come back
to the station with us.

638
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:42,656
I'm sure Starfleet would
like to hear anything

639
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:45,576
you have to tell them
about the Dominion.

640
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:48,537
I'd be glad to tell them
all I know.

641
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,916
Quark...

642
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,085
maybe you'd better
take a look at this.

643
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,587
Sure.

644
00:29:56,587 --> 00:30:00,048
"Quark, be quiet.
Quark, stand watch.

645
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,592
Quark, pick a lock."

646
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:03,302
All you ever do
is order me around.

647
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,345
You know, Commander, I
think I've figured out

648
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,597
why humans don't
like Ferengi.

649
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:08,014
Not now, Quark.

650
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,516
The way I see it

651
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,436
humans used to be a lot
like Ferengi-- greedy

652
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:14,980
acquisitive, interested
only in profit.

653
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,982
We're a constant reminder
of a part of your past

654
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,233
you'd like to forget.

655
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,611
Quark, we don't
have time for this.

656
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:23,029
But you're
overlooking
something.

657
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:26,116
Humans used to be a lot
worse than the Ferengi--

658
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:27,451
slavery...

659
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:30,162
concentration camps

660
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,456
interstellar wars.

661
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:35,125
We have nothing
in our past

662
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:38,337
that approaches that
kind of barbarism.

663
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,879
You see?

664
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,799
We're nothing like you.

665
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,634
We're better.

666
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:48,221
Now... if you'll
excuse me...

667
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,932
I have a lock to pick.

668
00:30:57,815 --> 00:30:59,608
JAKE:
This shouldn't be
so hard.

669
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:02,235
I just watched Chief O'Brien
run a maintenance check

670
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:05,197
on the<i> Mekong's</i> navigational
array a couple of weeks ago.

671
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,615
Well, from the looks of things

672
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:08,492
you haven't been
watching very closely.

673
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:09,535
Try that one.

674
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:11,620
I don't think
that's it.

675
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,706
Try it.
I have a hunch.

676
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:15,499
All right.
Let's see.

677
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:19,211
Warning. Warp core collapse
in ten seconds.

678
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,713
Nine, eight...

679
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:23,006
Put it back,
put it back!

680
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,550
...seven, six...
(<i> Nog shrieking</i> )

681
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:29,555
Warp core containment field
stabilized.

682
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:31,306
Sorry.

683
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,599
Wait a second...

684
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,351
the G&amp;N relay.

685
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:35,977
What about it?

686
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,521
I think O'Brien said something

687
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:39,815
about the autopilot
being connected

688
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,192
to the guidance
and navigational relay.

689
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,236
If I could just find it...

690
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:47,197
It was this round thing,
with this square part

691
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:48,824
on the bottom.

692
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,492
I think I got it.

693
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,285
Is that it?

694
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,995
I hope so.

695
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,956
Computer, what's the status
on the autopilot?

696
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:59,877
The automatic pilot system
is not functional.

697
00:31:59,877 --> 00:32:01,754
All right!
Yes!

698
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:05,424
Lay in a course for
the wormhole at warp eight.

699
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:06,925
COMPUTER:
Unable to comply.

700
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,846
The automatic pilot system
is not functional.

701
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,848
Now what?

702
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:15,392
I guess we'll have to try
and fly it ourselves.

703
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,909
KEOGH:
Starfleet's orders are simple.

704
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:33,702
Traffic through the wormhole
will be suspended

705
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,203
until the<i> Odyssey</i>
can investigate

706
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,538
the Jem'Hadar's threat.

707
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,290
What about Benjamin
and the others?

708
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,792
Don't worry, Lieutenant.

709
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:42,085
Commander Sisko's return
is a top priority.

710
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,754
If you're going to try
to rescue them

711
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:44,963
then we're coming with you.

712
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,132
Are you sure that's wise?

713
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,426
With the exception
of Major Kira and Mr. O'Brien

714
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:51,261
none of you have had
much combat experience.

715
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:54,139
We fought the Maquis.

716
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:58,351
All the Maquis had were a pair
of lightly-armed shuttlecraft.

717
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:01,229
I expect the Dominion
to have sharper teeth.

718
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,856
Well, then you're
going to need

719
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:05,191
all the help you can get.

720
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:08,612
Mr. O'Brien, can you equip
the two remaining runabouts

721
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:11,698
with extra banks
of photon torpedoes?

722
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,909
I already started retrofitting
their weapons systems.

723
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,327
They should be ready
in a few hours.

724
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,955
DAX:
It should take
at least that long

725
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:20,916
to off-load all the nonessential
personnel from the<i> Odyssey.</i>

726
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:23,251
You were planning on doing that,
weren't you?

727
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,795
Lieutenant,
have you ever thought

728
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,087
of serving on a starship?

729
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,965
I'm happy where I am.

730
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:29,675
Good.

731
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:31,301
Major, be prepared to
leave at 1300 hours.

732
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:32,803
I'll be aboard the<i> Odyssey</i> 
if you need me.

733
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:34,137
Yes, sir.

734
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,639
I thought you said
Keogh didn't like you.

735
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:38,057
Did I say that?

736
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,392
Come on, you heard him.

737
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,853
We've got three hours.

738
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,526
(<i> sighs</i> )

739
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:50,445
Station security is
to be on maximum alert.

740
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,698
I want random patrols
of all corridors

741
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,825
and periodic sensor sweeps
of every level.

742
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:57,494
Now, the provisional government
has agreed to send us

743
00:33:57,494 --> 00:34:00,246
a detachment
of extra security personnel.

744
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:02,248
This outlines
how I want them deployed.

745
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,333
Odo.

746
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:04,376
Major.

747
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:05,752
That will be all.

748
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,005
Captain Keogh has moved up
our departure time.

749
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:09,422
We have to be ready
in 15 minutes.

750
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,591
I am on my way
to meet Chief O'Brien

751
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,720
and Lieutenant Dax
at the<i> Mekong</i> right now.

752
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,597
Are you sure that you
don't want to stay

753
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,349
and oversee things
here on the station?

754
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:20,809
I don't know what we're
going to come up against

755
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,477
once we're there.

756
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,813
Your duties do<i> not</i>
require you to come with us.

757
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:28,483
I realize that, but I figure
while you and the others

758
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,152
are trying to rescue
Sisko and the boys

759
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:34,031
someone ought to be there
to look out for Quark.

760
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:35,490
Quark?

761
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,575
Huh.

762
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:37,826
You're joking.

763
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,619
I thought you
hated Quark.

764
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,247
I do, but I'd rather
see him in jail

765
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,332
than in the hands
of the Dominion.

766
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,876
Believe me, Major

767
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,586
if anything
happened to him

768
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:48,837
you'd miss him, too.

769
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,006
I'd be willing to take
that chance...

770
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:53,216
but not today.

771
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,969
I'd better get
to the<i> Orinoco.</i>

772
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,679
Odo...

773
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,140
keep your head down.

774
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,769
Make sure you do the same.

775
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:28,418
Where's the welcoming
committee?

776
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,342
Maybe the Jem'Hadar
were bluffing.

777
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:37,928
Or maybe it's a trap.

778
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:39,429
KEOGH:
<i>Odyssey</i> to runabouts.

779
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:40,806
Go ahead, Captain.

780
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:42,599
Preliminary tachyon
scans are negative.

781
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,268
We're not detecting anything
on long-range scanners

782
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,645
but, for all we know

783
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,396
the Dominion could have
cloaking technology.

784
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,565
We'll keep
our eyes open.

785
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,192
I'm telling you, Jake,
we should go to warp.

786
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:55,487
First, let me get the hang
of flying at impulse.

787
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,280
How hard can it be?

788
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,907
Are you kidding?

789
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,743
You think making course
corrections manually is easy?

790
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:04,203
But, at this speed, it'll
take weeks to get home.

791
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,665
Actually, it'll
take about five years.

792
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:15,007
Can't we reassemble
the autopilot?

793
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:16,758
If Chief O'Brien
taught me anything

794
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:18,885
it's that it's a lot easier
taking things apart

795
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,971
than putting them
back together.

796
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:23,098
COMPUTER:
Warning. Three ships
coming out of warp.

797
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,390
Where? Where?

798
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,433
Right there!

799
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,852
(<i> shrieking</i> )

800
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:29,604
O'BRIEN:
<i>Mekong</i> to<i> Rio Grande.</i>

801
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,897
(<i> sighs of relief</i> )

802
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,398
(<i> laughing</i> )

803
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,775
Hey, Chief, it's me, Jake.

804
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:36,235
KIRA:
Jake, are we glad to find you.

805
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,863
Where's your father?

806
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:39,990
He and Quark
were taken prisoner.

807
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,283
O'BRIEN:
Jake, come to a full stop.

808
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,660
I'll beam aboard.

809
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:53,128
Having trouble
getting it out of orbit?

810
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,462
How'd you know?

811
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,922
Chief, we have to go back
and save my dad.

812
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,423
Don't worry, son.

813
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,758
That's exactly
what we're going to do.

814
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:08,060
This is a very
sophisticated device.

815
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,062
Most telepathic
suppressers I've seen

816
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:12,022
have been much bulkier.

817
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:14,900
You know, there might
be a market for this
on the Alpha Quadrant.

818
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,568
You're hurting me.

819
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,403
I'm sorry, but I don't
have much to work with.

820
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:19,946
You've been at it
for hours.

821
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:23,575
If you would just stay
still, I'd be... done.

822
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:26,327
All right, let's
get out of here.

823
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,871
Stand back.

824
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,710
(<i> roaring</i> )

825
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,883
(<i> grunting</i> )

826
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:41,885
Quark, move it!

827
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:50,560
Thanks.

828
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,562
You're welcome.

829
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:54,064
Let's go.

830
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:05,324
Major, I'm picking up something
on forward scanners.

831
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:06,826
KEOGH:
<i>Odyssey</i> to runabouts.

832
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,411
KIRA:
Go ahead,<i> Odyssey.</i>

833
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,996
We're detecting
three incoming ships

834
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,206
in attack formation.

835
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,832
Shields up.
Going to Red Alert.

836
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,333
Odo, take the helm.

837
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,543
I'll handle
the targeting controls.

838
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,754
Very good.

839
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:18,797
Captain, this is
the<i> Rio Grande.</i>

840
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,298
KEOGH:
Go ahead.

841
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,758
Half the systems in
this ship are disabled.

842
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:23,260
I'm going to have
to break formation.

843
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,886
Understood.
Return to the wormhole.

844
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:27,097
We'll try to screen you
from enemy fire.

845
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:28,848
Well, what about my dad?

846
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,642
Captain, I'd like to see

847
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,102
if I can get close
enough to the planet

848
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:33,352
to locate
Commander Sisko.

849
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,729
All right,
but you have ten minutes.

850
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,189
Then I want you out of there.

851
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:37,398
Enemy ships within range.

852
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,984
Ready to fire at your command.

853
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:41,444
Runabouts, break formation,
attack pattern Delta.

854
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,446
Here they come.

855
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,708
I'm getting
casualty reports

856
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,128
from decks 4,
5, 8 and 17.

857
00:38:58,128 --> 00:39:00,505
We also have a plasma leak
in our port nacelle.

858
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,757
Deploy damage-control teams.
Aye, sir!

859
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,801
Keogh to runabouts.
KIRA: Go ahead.

860
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:07,012
They're using some kind
of phased polaron beam

861
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:08,763
to penetrate our shields.

862
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,474
Have you tried altering
your harmonics to compensate?

863
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:14,144
We've run through
the entire spectrum

864
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:16,395
but none of the frequencies
were effective.

865
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,940
Divert shield power to weapons.

866
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,442
We'll give O'Brien
five more minutes.

867
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,944
Then we're getting out of here!
Understood.

868
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,988
Dax, let's see
if we can take

869
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:26,114
some pressure
off the<i> Odyssey.</i>

870
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:27,907
DAX:
We're with you.
Hang on.

871
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,645
(<i> panting</i> )

872
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,106
Wait... stop.

873
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,983
I've got to start using

874
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,236
one of those holosuite
exercise programs.

875
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:07,572
He's slowing us down.

876
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,448
He can hide in the underbrush.

877
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:12,451
We'll transport him to safety
once we get to your ship.

878
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,453
No, I'm not leaving
him behind.

879
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,830
We never would have
gotten away

880
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,165
from the Jem'Hadar
without him.

881
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,042
Thank you, Commander.

882
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,960
I'm glad someone
around here

883
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,420
appreciates me.

884
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,676
Dad!

885
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,056
This has turned into<i> some</i> 
science project, huh, Jake?

886
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,641
Uncle Quark!

887
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:39,062
Nog, you're never going
on a field trip again.

888
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:40,521
(<i> shrieking</i> )

889
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,066
Take Eris back
to the passenger compartment

890
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:44,442
and wait there.

891
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,027
Jake...

892
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,071
well done.

893
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:08,007
My controls are dead!

894
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,717
We've lost our sensors!

895
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,261
Break off,<i> Mekong.</i>
Initiate evasive maneuvers.

896
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:13,221
We'll lay down
covering fire.

897
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:14,597
Acknowledged!

898
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,141
O'BRIEN:
<i>Rio Grande</i> to<i> Odyssey.</i>

899
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:17,725
We've got Sisko.

900
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,269
Well done, Chief.

901
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:21,520
Damage control team
to level 7.

902
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,814
Our tactical control
system is down.

903
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,107
We've lost all
power to phasers.

904
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:25,733
Bridge to Engineering!

905
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,152
Get that port nacelle
back on line.

906
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:28,736
Aye, sir.

907
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,406
Keogh to runabouts,
we've got what we came for.

908
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:32,949
We'd better fall back
before we...

909
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:34,409
(<i> static</i> )

910
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,035
Their communications array
must have been hit.

911
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,703
Kira, Dax, you heard him.

912
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:39,164
Let's get out of here.

913
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:46,712
Major, one of
the Jem'Hadar ships

914
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,131
is making a direct run
at the<i> Odyssey.</i>

915
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:49,466
Move to intercept.

916
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,664
We were retreating.

917
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:24,125
There was no need
for a suicide run.

918
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,461
They're showing us how far
they're willing to go.

919
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:29,464
Set a course for the wormhole.

920
00:42:41,518 --> 00:42:43,395
Commander, wait.

921
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,567
We need to talk.

922
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,993
Hmm. I can't believe

923
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,912
I'm on the other side
of the galaxy.

924
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:03,206
SISKO:
You'll get used to it.

925
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:04,999
Move away from her.

926
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:12,424
I don't understand.

927
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:15,343
I've been looking over
this collar of yours.

928
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:17,262
I thought if I replicated it

929
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:19,597
I might be able
to turn a tidy profit.

930
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,140
Imagine my surprise

931
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,768
when I discovered
there's nothing in here.

932
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:25,895
It's just a complicated
locking device.

933
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:27,355
Which means you
could have used

934
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:28,940
your telekinetic
abilities

935
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,275
at any time.

936
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:32,610
So the question is,
why didn't you?

937
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,613
You seem to already
know the answer.

938
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,907
The Jem'Hadar wanted us
to escape, didn't they?

939
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:42,245
That was the plan all along--
for us to bring you back here

940
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:44,247
so you could spy
on the Federation.

941
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:46,082
Well done, Commander.

942
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:48,501
You're one of the Founders,
aren't you?

943
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:49,835
You think the Founders

944
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:51,546
would waste their
time with you?

945
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,047
Constable.

946
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,925
Madam, if you'll
come with us.

947
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:58,344
You have no idea
what's begun here.

948
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:01,264
<i>( beeps )</i>

949
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:05,726
Chief! I'm picking up
a transporter signature
but I can't trace it.

950
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,895
She didn't rematerialize
anywhere on the station

951
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,188
and there are
no ships nearby.

952
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,149
Then where is she?
She'll be back.

953
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:13,443
The question is
who she'll bring with her.

954
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:16,779
If the Dominion
comes through the wormhole

955
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,240
the first battle
will be fought here...

956
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,410
and I intend
to be ready for them.
