1
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:14,176
Hey, Jake.

2
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:15,649
What's all this?

3
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,151
My science project.

4
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:19,849
I'm growing Bajoran
katterpods to find out

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,189
which hybrid yields
the biggest root.

6
00:00:22,294 --> 00:00:25,163
That's it? You're just
going to watch it grow?

7
00:00:25,198 --> 00:00:26,723
Yeah. Pretty neat, huh?

8
00:00:26,768 --> 00:00:28,430
Hmm. Not bad.

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,636
But don't you think
it's a little low-tech?

10
00:00:32,678 --> 00:00:36,116
I'm a low-tech kind of guy, Dad.

11
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,051
I still think
you can do something

12
00:00:38,086 --> 00:00:39,577
a little more challenging.

13
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:42,855
If you could do any
science project you wanted to

14
00:00:42,894 --> 00:00:45,363
anything at all,
what would it be?

15
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:49,229
Learn how to pilot a runabout?

16
00:00:49,304 --> 00:00:53,641
Well, that's not exactly
a science project, is it?

17
00:00:55,313 --> 00:00:56,804
Second choice.

18
00:00:58,452 --> 00:01:00,250
Visit the Gamma Quadrant?

19
00:01:00,288 --> 00:01:02,189
And what would you do
when you got there?

20
00:01:02,224 --> 00:01:04,693
I don't know. I...

21
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:06,789
I could do a planetary survey.

22
00:01:06,832 --> 00:01:08,300
Not bad.

23
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:11,906
All right, let's do it.

24
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,636
Really?

25
00:01:13,676 --> 00:01:16,043
It'll be like a vacation,
a working vacation.

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,912
That's great!
Thanks, Dad.

27
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,078
I'll bet we'll have
a great time.

28
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,486
I know we will.

29
00:01:25,428 --> 00:01:26,726
Let's see.

30
00:01:26,764 --> 00:01:29,063
We have a Bolian freighter
due in day after tomorrow.

31
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,194
We'll be outfitting
another group of settlers

32
00:01:31,238 --> 00:01:33,070
leaving for New Bajor.

33
00:01:33,107 --> 00:01:36,044
You know, I heard
their new irrigation system

34
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,069
is really something to see.

35
00:01:37,113 --> 00:01:38,445
When you get
to the Gamma Quadrant

36
00:01:38,482 --> 00:01:39,450
you ought to take a look.

37
00:01:39,484 --> 00:01:40,543
Not this trip.

38
00:01:40,585 --> 00:01:43,715
I really want to spend
some time alone with Jake.

39
00:01:43,757 --> 00:01:46,887
When's the <i>Odyssey</i> due back
from the Cardassian border?

40
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:48,158
Three days.

41
00:01:48,198 --> 00:01:52,501
It's a shame I'll have to miss
your reunion with Captain Keogh.

42
00:01:52,538 --> 00:01:56,567
Don't you find him
just a little arrogant?

43
00:01:56,611 --> 00:01:59,012
Funny... he said
the same thing about you.

44
00:01:59,048 --> 00:02:01,040
Did he?

45
00:02:01,085 --> 00:02:03,988
Commander, your son's
here to see you.

46
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,491
Send him in.

47
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:08,155
He's really looking
forward to this trip.

48
00:02:08,197 --> 00:02:09,665
Dad, guess what?

49
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,565
I was talking to Nog

50
00:02:11,602 --> 00:02:13,230
and it turns out
he's having trouble

51
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:14,739
coming up
with a science project

52
00:02:14,774 --> 00:02:16,504
so I told him
he could be my partner.

53
00:02:17,779 --> 00:02:20,477
We can finish this up later.

54
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,144
Partner?

55
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:25,088
We asked Mrs. O'Brien,
and she said it would be okay

56
00:02:25,123 --> 00:02:28,219
so I invited Nog to come
with us to the Gamma Quadrant.

57
00:02:28,262 --> 00:02:31,392
Now, hold on a second, Jake-o.

58
00:02:31,434 --> 00:02:33,130
Dad, if Nog doesn't get
a good grade

59
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,263
on this science project

60
00:02:34,339 --> 00:02:36,501
he's going to drop out
of school.

61
00:02:36,542 --> 00:02:38,135
And I can't let that happen.

62
00:02:38,178 --> 00:02:41,513
Maybe he can help you analyze
the survey information

63
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,018
when we get back.

64
00:02:43,052 --> 00:02:44,111
That's not enough.

65
00:02:44,153 --> 00:02:47,090
Mrs. O'Brien said he'd have
to be an equal partner.

66
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,117
Come on, Dad.

67
00:02:51,332 --> 00:02:53,801
He's my friend.

68
00:02:53,836 --> 00:02:55,464
I have to help him.

69
00:03:04,052 --> 00:03:06,682
Morn, you've been
sitting here all day

70
00:03:06,723 --> 00:03:08,715
staring at the same drink.

71
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,228
Talk to me.

72
00:03:10,262 --> 00:03:11,730
I want to help.

73
00:03:11,765 --> 00:03:15,259
I'm not just your bartender,
I'm your friend.

74
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,364
Whatever's wrong,
I'm here for you.

75
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:20,105
Hold that thought.

76
00:03:20,145 --> 00:03:21,909
Well, uh, what did he say?

77
00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:23,439
What did who say?

78
00:03:23,483 --> 00:03:26,283
Commander Sisko...
about my idea.

79
00:03:26,355 --> 00:03:28,256
You mean using the monitors

80
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,091
throughout the station
to sell merchandise?

81
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:32,654
Stop torturing me, Odo.

82
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:34,099
Tell me what he said.

83
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:35,601
Guess.

84
00:03:35,636 --> 00:03:37,104
He said yes.

85
00:03:37,138 --> 00:03:38,766
Guess again.

86
00:03:38,808 --> 00:03:40,572
It would triple my profits.

87
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:42,102
How could he refuse?

88
00:03:42,146 --> 00:03:44,115
Maybe it's because
he doesn't like you.

89
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:45,777
Don't be ridiculous.

90
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:47,617
Major Kira is the one
that doesn't like me.

91
00:03:47,656 --> 00:03:48,624
Sisko...

92
00:03:48,657 --> 00:03:49,625
Doesn't like you either.

93
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:50,627
What'd I ever do to him?

94
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,629
Oh, I could think
of one or two things.

95
00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:54,132
Oh, one or two things,
that's nothing.

96
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:56,532
So, do you think there's any way
I can change his mind?

97
00:04:00,342 --> 00:04:01,310
Uncle Quark?

98
00:04:01,344 --> 00:04:02,744
Not now.

99
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,248
I just wanted to tell you

100
00:04:04,281 --> 00:04:05,806
I'm not going to be able
to work my shift

101
00:04:05,851 --> 00:04:06,910
for the next couple of days.

102
00:04:06,953 --> 00:04:08,421
Why not?

103
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:10,549
I-I'm going
to the Gamma Quadrant

104
00:04:10,592 --> 00:04:12,288
with Jake and his father.

105
00:04:12,395 --> 00:04:15,195
You're going
to the Gamma Quadrant

106
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:17,202
with Commander Sisko.

107
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,936
How lucky for you.

108
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:29,009
Oh, I always wanted to see

109
00:06:29,046 --> 00:06:31,242
what the cockpit
of a runabout looked like.

110
00:06:31,284 --> 00:06:33,685
Hey, how do you fire
the phasers?

111
00:06:33,721 --> 00:06:34,916
Nog, you promised.

112
00:06:34,956 --> 00:06:36,584
Oh, I wasn't going
to touch anything.

113
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:39,222
Why don't the two of you
stow our gear away in the back

114
00:06:39,263 --> 00:06:40,731
while I go through prelaunch?

115
00:06:40,765 --> 00:06:42,791
I'll do it.

116
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:46,273
I'll be right there.

117
00:06:46,308 --> 00:06:47,867
"Fire the phasers"?

118
00:06:47,911 --> 00:06:49,402
He was just kidding.

119
00:06:49,513 --> 00:06:50,412
Look, Dad, I know

120
00:06:50,514 --> 00:06:52,244
this isn't exactly
the trip you planned on

121
00:06:52,284 --> 00:06:54,150
but you'll see...
Nog's a great guy.

122
00:06:54,186 --> 00:06:55,381
I'm sure he is.

123
00:06:55,422 --> 00:06:58,188
I was just hoping that you and I
could spend this time together.

124
00:06:58,227 --> 00:06:59,422
We will. Don't worry.

125
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:01,431
You won't even
know Nog's along.

126
00:07:01,532 --> 00:07:03,865
This'll be a great
trip, you'll see.

127
00:07:03,902 --> 00:07:05,495
Ah, there you are.

128
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:07,029
Where do I put my bags?

129
00:07:07,074 --> 00:07:09,100
Uncle Quark,
what are you doing here?

130
00:07:09,144 --> 00:07:11,613
What does it look like?
I'm going with you.

131
00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:13,014
Since when?

132
00:07:13,051 --> 00:07:15,851
Really, Commander,
you don't expect my nephew

133
00:07:15,888 --> 00:07:18,289
to go all the way
to the Gamma Quadrant

134
00:07:18,326 --> 00:07:20,022
without proper supervision?

135
00:07:21,597 --> 00:07:22,792
No offense...

136
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,495
some of my best friends
are humans...

137
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:28,737
but my brother, Rom,
isn't as liberal as I am.

138
00:07:28,775 --> 00:07:30,801
Let's face it...
he's never been comfortable

139
00:07:30,845 --> 00:07:32,541
about Nog's friendship
with your son.

140
00:07:32,581 --> 00:07:34,675
You can tell Rom not to worry.

141
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:36,915
I'll take good care of the boy

142
00:07:36,955 --> 00:07:38,651
and I promise I won't try

143
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:41,218
to corrupt him
with my human values.

144
00:07:41,262 --> 00:07:42,730
I know that

145
00:07:42,764 --> 00:07:46,258
but Rom is convinced all humans
look down upon Ferengi

146
00:07:46,304 --> 00:07:49,139
and by allowing me
to come on this trip

147
00:07:49,174 --> 00:07:51,268
you can help prove him wrong.

148
00:07:51,312 --> 00:07:52,918
He is wrong, isn't he?

149
00:07:54,454 --> 00:07:56,787
Dad, please.

150
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:01,331
All right.

151
00:08:01,365 --> 00:08:04,165
Let's get going
before anyone else shows up.

152
00:08:04,202 --> 00:08:06,171
Thanks, Dad, thanks.

153
00:08:06,206 --> 00:08:07,697
Whoo-hoo.

154
00:08:23,867 --> 00:08:25,335
This place is great.

155
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:29,000
Our preliminary surveys suggest
it's a lot like Earth

156
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:30,840
during the early
Devonian period...

157
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:33,040
a lot of plant life,
fish, some insects

158
00:08:33,115 --> 00:08:36,450
but no predators
or large animals.

159
00:08:36,487 --> 00:08:37,785
Pretty, isn't it?

160
00:08:37,823 --> 00:08:39,621
I don't see
what's so pretty about it.

161
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,321
I think they mean
the trees and stuff.

162
00:08:42,329 --> 00:08:43,524
Quark, this is
as close to paradise

163
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:44,658
as you're going to get.

164
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,398
All you need to do is to allow
yourself to see it.

165
00:08:47,438 --> 00:08:48,997
I'll tell you what I see.

166
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,069
In two words...
exploitable resources.

167
00:08:53,114 --> 00:08:55,812
I suppose you want
to cut down all these trees

168
00:08:55,851 --> 00:08:57,945
and start strip mining
the entire planet.

169
00:08:57,988 --> 00:09:00,184
As a wise man once wrote

170
00:09:00,225 --> 00:09:04,220
"Nature decays,
but latinum lasts forever."

171
00:09:04,264 --> 00:09:06,392
Rule of Acquisition
Number 102.

172
00:09:06,435 --> 00:09:07,903
Good lad.

173
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:10,738
Nog, I have some ointment
in one of my bags. Get it.

174
00:09:10,775 --> 00:09:13,006
What's the problem?

175
00:09:13,046 --> 00:09:15,710
Oh, I get a mild reaction
now and then.

176
00:09:15,749 --> 00:09:17,342
To what?

177
00:09:17,385 --> 00:09:19,047
Nature.

178
00:09:19,122 --> 00:09:20,351
Perhaps you'd be
more comfortable

179
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,358
sleeping on the runabout.

180
00:09:21,392 --> 00:09:23,384
And miss all the fun?

181
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,057
Never.

182
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,590
Besides, I'm really
looking forward

183
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:30,606
to our getting to
know each other better.

184
00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:47,124
Ah, that's much better.

185
00:09:48,903 --> 00:09:52,068
Now, if it only wasn't so hot.

186
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:53,770
I hadn't noticed.

187
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:58,307
It isn't the heat so much
as the humidity and the insects

188
00:09:58,351 --> 00:10:00,479
the stench of these flowers.

189
00:10:00,521 --> 00:10:03,013
I'm glad we could
talk like this.

190
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:06,121
There's nothing like
facing the wilderness

191
00:10:06,163 --> 00:10:08,132
to bring people closer.

192
00:10:08,201 --> 00:10:09,829
The answer is still no, Quark.

193
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,338
No? No to what?

194
00:10:11,372 --> 00:10:13,739
I'm not going to allow you
to sell merchandise

195
00:10:13,776 --> 00:10:15,711
over the station's monitors.

196
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:17,043
Why not?

197
00:10:17,081 --> 00:10:18,549
It's a brilliant idea.

198
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,018
With my connections

199
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:22,284
I could offer
a whole range of merchandise

200
00:10:22,323 --> 00:10:25,419
which normally couldn't
be acquired in this sector.

201
00:10:25,461 --> 00:10:26,588
Such as?

202
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,791
Collectibles...

203
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,059
Andorian jewelry

204
00:10:30,102 --> 00:10:31,400
Vulcan IDIC pins

205
00:10:31,438 --> 00:10:33,634
Bolian crystalsteel...

206
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,041
And with my low overhead

207
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:39,379
I could offer these items
at a significant discount.

208
00:10:40,685 --> 00:10:44,851
Quark, you're wasting
your time and mine.

209
00:10:44,892 --> 00:10:46,121
Ah, ah, ah...

210
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,719
Did I mention
I was going to donate

211
00:10:47,763 --> 00:10:51,098
two percent of my net profits
to the Bajoran Fund for Orphans?

212
00:10:52,504 --> 00:10:54,132
Three percent?

213
00:10:57,245 --> 00:10:59,111
So, how's it going?

214
00:10:59,148 --> 00:11:01,617
The atmosphere
is 77% nitrogen

215
00:11:01,653 --> 00:11:04,145
21% oxygen
and 2% carbon dioxide.

216
00:11:04,223 --> 00:11:07,126
The water contains
traces of copper, nickel

217
00:11:07,161 --> 00:11:08,857
and a little birythium.

218
00:11:08,897 --> 00:11:10,525
You're showing
a little lead there, too.

219
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:11,829
That's from
the surrounding soil

220
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:12,996
but we think it's localized.

221
00:11:13,038 --> 00:11:14,028
We're going to check

222
00:11:14,072 --> 00:11:15,904
other water sources,
just to be sure.

223
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,273
Why not wait until tomorrow?

224
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:18,779
I was just about
to start dinner.

225
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:19,781
Jambalaya?

226
00:11:19,815 --> 00:11:20,783
How did you know?

227
00:11:20,816 --> 00:11:21,806
Great!

228
00:11:21,851 --> 00:11:22,944
Jambawhat?

229
00:11:22,987 --> 00:11:25,013
You're going to love it.

230
00:11:25,057 --> 00:11:27,721
The two of you
did good work today.

231
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,892
Yes!

232
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,208
Anyone want some more?

233
00:11:37,242 --> 00:11:38,710
Not me.

234
00:11:38,745 --> 00:11:41,214
Oh, me neither, Commander,
but it was very good.

235
00:11:41,248 --> 00:11:42,716
You know, I think

236
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:45,220
I'm developing a taste
for human food.

237
00:11:45,255 --> 00:11:46,746
Quark?

238
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:51,822
I still say there's
some dirt in the sauce.

239
00:11:51,866 --> 00:11:53,835
And these bugs.

240
00:11:53,869 --> 00:11:55,030
Look at this.

241
00:11:55,071 --> 00:11:57,370
They get into everything.

242
00:11:57,408 --> 00:11:58,967
It's disgusting.

243
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,241
I thought the Ferengis
liked eating bugs.

244
00:12:01,348 --> 00:12:05,981
Only certain bugs...
Ferengi bugs.

245
00:12:06,021 --> 00:12:10,427
Nog, get some more ointment
for the back of my neck.

246
00:12:10,462 --> 00:12:12,522
Yes, Uncle.

247
00:12:16,406 --> 00:12:18,534
Better get a good night's sleep.

248
00:12:18,575 --> 00:12:20,703
You have another
big day tomorrow.

249
00:12:20,745 --> 00:12:24,046
Yeah, I want to start
cataloging the plant life

250
00:12:24,084 --> 00:12:25,950
first thing in the morning.

251
00:12:25,987 --> 00:12:28,719
You know what this reminds of?

252
00:12:28,758 --> 00:12:30,226
Hmm.

253
00:12:30,294 --> 00:12:33,595
The camping trip we took
on Itamish III.

254
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:36,570
I don't think
I remember you, me and Mom

255
00:12:36,604 --> 00:12:38,800
ever having more fun together.

256
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,241
Hmm.

257
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:43,576
Isn't that where I taught
you how to water ski?

258
00:12:43,615 --> 00:12:46,984
Mom taught me
how to water ski.

259
00:12:47,021 --> 00:12:50,117
Yes. She always was
the graceful one.

260
00:12:53,765 --> 00:12:55,597
You know, Jake...

261
00:12:57,671 --> 00:12:59,765
we really need to get away
more often.

262
00:12:59,808 --> 00:13:01,367
I'm ready whenever you are.

263
00:13:01,411 --> 00:13:02,902
I'm sure Nog is, too.

264
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:05,843
I'm joking.

265
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:10,283
I'm on fire!

266
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,988
I'm on fire!

267
00:13:15,132 --> 00:13:16,623
Quark!

268
00:13:16,668 --> 00:13:17,829
Cover it up!

269
00:13:19,506 --> 00:13:20,974
Are you all right?

270
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,808
No!
I am not all right.

271
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:25,838
My ears itch,
my nose is running

272
00:13:25,883 --> 00:13:27,408
I'm eating foreign bugs!

273
00:13:27,452 --> 00:13:28,681
Now look at me!

274
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:30,212
One minute I'm trying
to pick a couple of bugs

275
00:13:30,257 --> 00:13:31,885
out of that jumba-what's-a-pot

276
00:13:31,926 --> 00:13:33,895
the next thing I know...
whoosh!

277
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:35,227
Quark, calm down.

278
00:13:35,265 --> 00:13:37,063
Look, do us all a favor.

279
00:13:37,101 --> 00:13:39,628
Sit down and try
to stay out of trouble.

280
00:13:39,672 --> 00:13:40,970
What did I do?

281
00:13:43,311 --> 00:13:45,803
I'd better go see if he's okay.

282
00:13:47,417 --> 00:13:49,283
Now, see what you've done.

283
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,879
What I've done?

284
00:13:50,923 --> 00:13:54,691
The boy couldn't stand seeing
his favorite uncle insulted.

285
00:13:54,729 --> 00:13:57,632
I guess Rom was right after all.

286
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:59,033
You don't like Ferengi, do you?

287
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:00,037
That is not true.

288
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:01,039
All right.

289
00:14:01,072 --> 00:14:03,234
Name me one Ferengi
you do like.

290
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,575
Aha! You see?
I was right.

291
00:14:05,613 --> 00:14:08,243
You Federation types
are all alike.

292
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:11,811
You talk about tolerance
and understanding

293
00:14:11,856 --> 00:14:13,688
but you only practice it

294
00:14:13,726 --> 00:14:16,629
towards people who remind
you of yourselves.

295
00:14:16,664 --> 00:14:20,158
Because you disapprove
of Ferengi values

296
00:14:20,203 --> 00:14:22,672
you scorn us, distrust us

297
00:14:22,707 --> 00:14:26,008
insult us
every chance you get.

298
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:28,446
Quark, I don't have to stand
here and defend myself.

299
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:29,781
Tell me, Commander.

300
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:32,015
Would you allow your son
to marry a Ferengi female?

301
00:14:32,055 --> 00:14:33,284
I never thought about it!

302
00:14:33,391 --> 00:14:34,882
Exactly my point.

303
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,040
Don't hurt me.

304
00:14:46,077 --> 00:14:47,568
How many of them are there?

305
00:14:47,613 --> 00:14:49,548
There's just the two of us.

306
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,779
Not you, the Jem'Hadar.

307
00:14:53,356 --> 00:14:56,191
We don't know
who you're talking about.

308
00:14:56,227 --> 00:14:58,219
We are not your enemies.

309
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,022
Then you'd better run.

310
00:15:07,631 --> 00:15:10,466
It's too late.

311
00:15:10,503 --> 00:15:13,133
You're done running.

312
00:15:15,044 --> 00:15:18,812
This has not been a good day.

313
00:15:40,818 --> 00:15:43,482
Dad, this is Jake.
Where are you?

314
00:15:43,523 --> 00:15:44,855
Dad, answer me.

315
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,359
I'm telling you, Jake,
something's happened to them.

316
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:49,626
Maybe they were attacked
by a wild animal.

317
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:50,758
You heard my dad.

318
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,167
There aren't any wild animals
just insects and plants.

319
00:15:53,205 --> 00:15:55,572
Maybe they were attacked
by a vicious tree.

320
00:15:55,608 --> 00:15:58,909
Hmm... take a look at this.

321
00:16:01,885 --> 00:16:03,820
I don't know any trees
that wear boots.

322
00:16:03,888 --> 00:16:06,484
We'd better beam up
to the runabout.

323
00:16:06,526 --> 00:16:08,188
Listen, we can't run away
just 'cause we're scared.

324
00:16:08,229 --> 00:16:10,927
Hey, who said anything
about being scared?

325
00:16:10,966 --> 00:16:13,960
I just thought the runabout
would be a good place

326
00:16:14,004 --> 00:16:15,597
to, uh, to plan our next move.

327
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,302
There's nothing to plan.

328
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,675
My dad never would
have left here

329
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:19,737
without telling me first.

330
00:16:19,781 --> 00:16:22,182
Not unless he was in
some sort of trouble.

331
00:16:22,218 --> 00:16:24,653
We can track him
with the tricorder.

332
00:16:24,688 --> 00:16:25,849
Hmm...

333
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,725
Hey! Wait for me!

334
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,260
Hey!

335
00:16:33,302 --> 00:16:35,168
Is anybody there?

336
00:16:35,205 --> 00:16:36,764
Hello?

337
00:16:36,808 --> 00:16:38,436
We're humanoids.

338
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:40,446
We require food and water.

339
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,108
Hello?

340
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:43,879
Quark, shut up.

341
00:16:43,986 --> 00:16:45,614
This is your fault.

342
00:16:45,655 --> 00:16:47,681
They were after you, not us.

343
00:16:47,725 --> 00:16:50,423
Why don't you say
something to them?

344
00:16:50,463 --> 00:16:53,263
Tell them you'd
never seen us before.

345
00:16:53,301 --> 00:16:55,497
We have nothing
to do with her.

346
00:16:55,537 --> 00:16:57,335
This is a misunderstanding.

347
00:16:57,374 --> 00:16:58,842
Quark...

348
00:16:58,876 --> 00:17:01,438
I have the right
to express my opinion.

349
00:17:01,481 --> 00:17:03,746
I'm about to put my fist
in your opinion.

350
00:17:03,784 --> 00:17:05,252
You don't scare me.

351
00:17:05,287 --> 00:17:07,415
And you want to know why
you don't scare me?

352
00:17:07,456 --> 00:17:08,947
Because I'm already
more scared

353
00:17:08,992 --> 00:17:10,517
than I've ever been
in my life.

354
00:17:10,561 --> 00:17:12,052
You're not helping anything.

355
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:14,123
I'm not helping anything?

356
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:17,696
I don't see you coming up
with any ideas, or her.

357
00:17:17,739 --> 00:17:20,437
If she wants to help us,
she will.

358
00:17:20,477 --> 00:17:23,004
Right now, I'd say she's even
more scared than you are.

359
00:17:23,048 --> 00:17:25,313
Believe me, she's not.

360
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:32,522
She's obviously been running
from these people for a while.

361
00:17:32,563 --> 00:17:36,126
She's probably
been through a lot.

362
00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:38,468
She doesn't know who we are
or what we're about.

363
00:17:39,507 --> 00:17:40,998
I just hope that Jake and Nog

364
00:17:41,043 --> 00:17:42,875
are smart enough
to stay out of sight

365
00:17:42,913 --> 00:17:44,006
until help gets here.

366
00:17:44,048 --> 00:17:46,483
Trust me, I didn't raise
my nephew to be a fool.

367
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:49,490
He'll find the nearest dark
hole and climb into it.

368
00:17:49,523 --> 00:17:51,355
I'm not so sure about Jake.

369
00:17:51,393 --> 00:17:53,624
If I know him,
he'll be looking for us.

370
00:17:53,664 --> 00:17:56,191
Don't they teach you
how to neutralize

371
00:17:56,234 --> 00:17:58,294
security fields
in Starfleet?

372
00:17:59,706 --> 00:18:02,404
I've never seen anything
like this before.

373
00:18:02,444 --> 00:18:04,675
It seems to be generated by...

374
00:18:04,714 --> 00:18:06,114
Don't.

375
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,278
The security barrier
will kill you.

376
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:11,019
Thanks for the warning.

377
00:18:11,058 --> 00:18:13,357
I have no wish
to see you hurt.

378
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:15,058
A lovely sentiment.

379
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,465
How did you know

380
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:25,002
that the security
barrier is lethal?

381
00:18:25,047 --> 00:18:27,916
Because everything about
the Jem'Hadar is lethal.

382
00:18:27,951 --> 00:18:31,616
Anything you could tell me
about them might be helpful.

383
00:18:33,461 --> 00:18:36,023
Are you saying you've never
heard of the Jem'Hadar?

384
00:18:36,064 --> 00:18:39,934
Oh, we're not
from around here.

385
00:18:39,971 --> 00:18:42,406
My name is Benjamin Sisko.

386
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:45,277
I'm from the United Federation
of Planets.

387
00:18:45,313 --> 00:18:48,250
We came through
a wormhole to get here.

388
00:18:48,285 --> 00:18:51,313
Our home is thousands
of light years away.

389
00:18:51,355 --> 00:18:53,290
My name is Eris.

390
00:18:53,326 --> 00:18:55,922
I'm glad to meet you...

391
00:18:55,963 --> 00:18:57,761
Eris.

392
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,747
That's Quark.

393
00:19:11,187 --> 00:19:12,815
Tell me about the Jem'Hadar.

394
00:19:12,857 --> 00:19:15,224
They are the most feared
soldiers in the Dominion.

395
00:19:15,261 --> 00:19:16,661
The Dominion?

396
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,725
The Ferengi have been trying
to open up trade negotiations

397
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:21,827
with the Dominion
for almost a year now.

398
00:19:21,872 --> 00:19:23,670
We've never heard
of the Jem'Hadar.

399
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,768
Then you've been fortunate.

400
00:19:25,811 --> 00:19:28,178
Negotiations with the Dominion

401
00:19:28,215 --> 00:19:29,843
can be a dangerous thing.

402
00:19:29,885 --> 00:19:32,856
If it's so dangerous, why would
anyone do business with them?

403
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:37,886
The Dominion decides that you
have something that they want

404
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:42,461
and then they come and take it
by negotiation or by force.

405
00:19:42,504 --> 00:19:45,100
Believe me, I know.

406
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:48,580
I've seen it happen
on my own world.

407
00:19:48,614 --> 00:19:52,211
Kurill Prime was offered entry
into the Dominion.

408
00:19:52,253 --> 00:19:55,486
They thought
our telekinetic powers would be

409
00:19:55,525 --> 00:19:56,788
useful to them.

410
00:19:56,827 --> 00:19:58,318
Back there in the camp...

411
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,764
that's what you used
to knock me down.

412
00:20:03,572 --> 00:20:07,101
When Kurill refused
the Dominion's offer

413
00:20:07,144 --> 00:20:09,238
they sent in the Jem'Hadar.

414
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,251
They destroyed
our communication center

415
00:20:12,285 --> 00:20:14,151
they executed our leaders

416
00:20:14,188 --> 00:20:16,157
and before we realized it

417
00:20:16,191 --> 00:20:18,989
they had seized control
of the entire planet.

418
00:20:19,122 --> 00:20:20,886
How did you manage to escape?

419
00:20:20,925 --> 00:20:22,484
I was on a freighter

420
00:20:22,528 --> 00:20:25,363
going home
when the attack occurred.

421
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:28,370
We fled, but they came after us.

422
00:20:30,307 --> 00:20:31,798
Why?

423
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:37,215
My mother was an outspoken
opponent of the Dominion.

424
00:20:37,251 --> 00:20:40,279
I guess they wanted to make
an example of my family.

425
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:42,485
That thing they put
around your neck...

426
00:20:42,526 --> 00:20:44,722
It suppresses
my telekinetic abilities.

427
00:20:44,763 --> 00:20:46,356
Without it, I might be able

428
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:48,664
to break though
the security barrier.

429
00:20:48,703 --> 00:20:51,697
Then we'll just have to find
a way to get this collar off.

430
00:20:51,741 --> 00:20:55,440
Well, even if we get past
the barrier

431
00:20:55,481 --> 00:20:58,247
no one ever escapes
from the Jem'Hadar.

432
00:20:58,285 --> 00:21:02,314
Luckily for us, they seem
as sure about that as you do.

433
00:21:02,358 --> 00:21:04,088
Look around you.

434
00:21:04,128 --> 00:21:08,294
They placed the three of us
in the same containment field.

435
00:21:08,335 --> 00:21:12,638
I've never seen more than four
guards on duty at any one time.

436
00:21:12,674 --> 00:21:14,142
As far as I can tell

437
00:21:14,177 --> 00:21:16,544
there's only this single
containment field

438
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,139
between us and freedom.

439
00:21:18,183 --> 00:21:19,651
They're overconfident

440
00:21:19,685 --> 00:21:22,713
and that's what's going
to help us get out of here.

441
00:21:22,757 --> 00:21:25,056
Maybe if I can pry off
that casing

442
00:21:25,095 --> 00:21:27,064
I can get at
the locking mechanism.

443
00:21:27,098 --> 00:21:29,397
May I?

444
00:21:29,434 --> 00:21:30,993
Of course.

445
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:36,501
You sure you know
how to read that thing?

446
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:37,514
Pretty sure.

447
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:38,982
Pretty sure?

448
00:21:39,017 --> 00:21:41,715
We've been walking for hours,
and you're only pretty sure?

449
00:21:41,755 --> 00:21:42,882
Would you be quiet?

450
00:21:42,923 --> 00:21:45,188
I'm picking up some kind
of humanoid life-forms.

451
00:21:47,564 --> 00:21:49,692
I don't know who they are

452
00:21:49,733 --> 00:21:51,668
but they don't look friendly.

453
00:21:51,704 --> 00:21:53,536
I wish we could get closer.

454
00:21:53,574 --> 00:21:56,704
I don't think they'll look
any friendlier close up.

455
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,855
Hello?

456
00:22:06,895 --> 00:22:11,460
I know someone must be
listening to me out there.

457
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:14,666
If we escape, do we have
to take him with us?

458
00:22:14,707 --> 00:22:15,868
He's not so bad.

459
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:17,275
Whoever's in charge

460
00:22:17,311 --> 00:22:20,544
you're missing a very
lucrative opportunity...

461
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:23,145
Doesn't he realize he's not
accomplishing anything?

462
00:22:23,187 --> 00:22:24,246
Don't be so sure.

463
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:25,257
We need to know

464
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,726
what the Jem'Hadar
plan to do with us

465
00:22:27,761 --> 00:22:29,559
which means we need
to get their attention.

466
00:22:29,597 --> 00:22:31,156
And if there's
one thing I know...

467
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,898
That's enough.

468
00:22:33,938 --> 00:22:37,205
...it's that Quark
is hard to ignore.

469
00:22:45,623 --> 00:22:47,615
I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko

470
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,788
of the United Federation
of Planets.

471
00:22:49,863 --> 00:22:51,491
I want to know why we
are being held here.

472
00:22:51,532 --> 00:22:54,560
That's not my concern.

473
00:22:54,604 --> 00:22:56,470
Then why won't you let us go?

474
00:22:56,507 --> 00:22:58,908
Because the Founders
don't want you released.

475
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,810
And who are the Founders?

476
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:03,282
That's not your concern.

477
00:23:03,318 --> 00:23:04,616
This isn't getting
us anywhere.

478
00:23:04,653 --> 00:23:05,678
Commander, allow me.

479
00:23:05,722 --> 00:23:08,089
How would you like
a thousand cases

480
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:09,684
of tulaberry wine?

481
00:23:11,297 --> 00:23:13,129
Don't bother, Commander.

482
00:23:13,167 --> 00:23:16,969
I'm not going to do
any permanent damage.

483
00:23:20,979 --> 00:23:23,643
If the Founders are the ones
who give the orders

484
00:23:23,684 --> 00:23:25,152
I want to meet them.

485
00:23:25,187 --> 00:23:26,883
Those aren't my orders.

486
00:23:26,923 --> 00:23:29,222
He can't take you
to the Founders

487
00:23:29,259 --> 00:23:30,591
because they don't exist.

488
00:23:30,628 --> 00:23:31,721
They're a myth.

489
00:23:31,764 --> 00:23:33,062
The Founders exist.

490
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:35,330
They created the Dominion.

491
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:38,830
And the Jem'Hadar
are their servants?

492
00:23:43,783 --> 00:23:46,811
A Ferengi and a human.

493
00:23:46,855 --> 00:23:49,347
I was hoping
the first race I'd meet

494
00:23:49,392 --> 00:23:51,793
from the other side
of the anomaly

495
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:53,821
would be the Klingons.

496
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,924
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

497
00:23:55,969 --> 00:23:58,496
It's too late for apologies.

498
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,841
The Dominion will
no longer stand by

499
00:24:01,879 --> 00:24:05,112
and allow ships from your side
to violate our territory.

500
00:24:07,053 --> 00:24:10,991
I hear the Klingons
are effective warriors.

501
00:24:11,026 --> 00:24:15,989
What's that weapon they're
so fond of... the <i>bat'leth?</i>

502
00:24:16,034 --> 00:24:18,903
I am not interested
in discussing the Klingons.

503
00:24:18,939 --> 00:24:20,567
All right.

504
00:24:20,608 --> 00:24:23,043
Then what about the Cardassians?

505
00:24:23,078 --> 00:24:25,640
Are you satisfied
with the treaty

506
00:24:25,683 --> 00:24:28,152
your Federation made with them?

507
00:24:28,187 --> 00:24:30,281
It seems a tactical error.

508
00:24:30,324 --> 00:24:33,818
How do you know so much
about our side of the galaxy?

509
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,365
We gain more knowledge every day

510
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,200
and now we have you
to help us learn more.

511
00:24:39,238 --> 00:24:42,334
I don't plan
on telling you anything.

512
00:24:42,376 --> 00:24:44,470
I won't be the one asking
the questions.

513
00:24:44,513 --> 00:24:46,345
Who will?

514
00:24:46,382 --> 00:24:49,945
I was really hoping
to meet a Klingon.

515
00:25:05,247 --> 00:25:08,412
Well, now that
we're all friends

516
00:25:08,452 --> 00:25:10,683
I feel so much better.

517
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,020
I hope this works.

518
00:25:32,056 --> 00:25:33,615
You wanted a plan,
I came up with a plan.

519
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:34,684
Now let me concentrate.

520
00:25:34,726 --> 00:25:37,561
Computer, scan the region
around our base camp

521
00:25:37,598 --> 00:25:39,624
for human and
Ferengi life-signs.

522
00:25:39,668 --> 00:25:41,728
One human
and one Ferengi located.

523
00:25:41,772 --> 00:25:42,797
That's them.

524
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:44,432
I told you this would work.

525
00:25:44,475 --> 00:25:46,876
Computer, lock onto
the two life-forms

526
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:47,972
and beam them up.

527
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:49,448
Unable to comply.

528
00:25:49,483 --> 00:25:53,216
Subjects are located inside
a spatial distortion field.

529
00:25:53,256 --> 00:25:55,521
I knew it couldn't be
that easy.

530
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,690
Maybe we'd better go back
to the station for help.

531
00:25:58,732 --> 00:25:59,859
Good idea.

532
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,267
Computer, fly us back
to the station.

533
00:26:02,304 --> 00:26:04,205
Please restate command.

534
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,709
Computer, disengage autopilot

535
00:26:06,744 --> 00:26:10,204
and lay in a course
back to the wormhole.

536
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,617
Enter authorization code.

537
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,954
Go ahead.

538
00:26:14,087 --> 00:26:15,919
What are you waiting for?

539
00:26:15,957 --> 00:26:17,789
I don't know
the authorization code!

540
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,318
Vessel approaching
from the planet's surface

541
00:26:20,364 --> 00:26:22,765
bearing 173 mark 281.

542
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:25,465
Computer, evasive maneuvers!

543
00:26:25,506 --> 00:26:27,134
Fire phasers!

544
00:26:27,175 --> 00:26:29,771
Launch torpedoes...
and escape pods!

545
00:26:31,481 --> 00:26:33,211
Computer, display

546
00:26:33,251 --> 00:26:35,447
the approaching ship
on the monitor.

547
00:26:35,488 --> 00:26:37,684
Computer, where did the ship go?

548
00:26:37,725 --> 00:26:42,859
The vessel has entered warp
bearing 171 mark 259.

549
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:47,335
Oh, maybe they didn't see us.

550
00:26:47,374 --> 00:26:50,641
Maybe we're not
what they're after.

551
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:52,580
So, what do we do now?

552
00:26:52,615 --> 00:26:55,084
We'll have to shut down
the autopilot.

553
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:56,917
How do we do that?

554
00:26:56,956 --> 00:26:59,722
I guess we'll find out
how much I learned

555
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,059
working for Chief O'Brien.

556
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,077
Lieutenant, what's the ETA
on the <i>Odyssey?</i>

557
00:27:15,118 --> 00:27:16,313
They're due in eight hours.

558
00:27:16,353 --> 00:27:18,015
I'm reading
elevated neutrino levels

559
00:27:18,056 --> 00:27:19,024
from the wormhole.

560
00:27:19,058 --> 00:27:20,890
On screen.

561
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:26,393
Hail them, Lieutenant.

562
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,597
They're not answering.

563
00:27:27,638 --> 00:27:29,004
Shields up.
Go to Yellow Alert.

564
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,170
Computer, intruder in Ops.

565
00:27:32,212 --> 00:27:33,840
Activate a level-3
containment field.

566
00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:39,715
I'm Major Kira Nerys,
First Officer of this station.

567
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,420
You'll have to excuse
the containment field

568
00:27:42,462 --> 00:27:44,397
but, around here, it's customary

569
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:46,866
to identify yourself
before transporting

570
00:27:46,903 --> 00:27:48,565
into someone else's
command center.

571
00:27:48,605 --> 00:27:51,337
I'm Third Talak'talan
of the Jem'Hadar.

572
00:27:51,376 --> 00:27:53,345
I'm here to inform you
that your Commander

573
00:27:53,379 --> 00:27:56,009
has been detained
for questioning by the Dominion.

574
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,951
Detained?
For how long?

575
00:27:57,986 --> 00:27:59,420
Indefinitely.

576
00:27:59,455 --> 00:28:01,424
Commander Sisko will serve
as an example

577
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:05,419
of what happens to anyone who
interferes with the Dominion.

578
00:28:05,465 --> 00:28:07,525
What kind of interference
are you talking about?

579
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:10,972
Coming through the anomaly
is interference enough.

580
00:28:11,007 --> 00:28:13,499
Unless you wish to continue
to offend the Dominion

581
00:28:13,545 --> 00:28:15,844
I suggest you stay
on your side of the galaxy.

582
00:28:15,882 --> 00:28:17,874
You're making a mistake
if you think

583
00:28:17,918 --> 00:28:19,716
that detaining Commander Sisko
will stop us

584
00:28:19,788 --> 00:28:21,256
from exploring
the Gamma Quadrant.

585
00:28:22,292 --> 00:28:25,092
We anticipated that response.

586
00:28:27,467 --> 00:28:28,958
Security team to Ops.

587
00:28:29,003 --> 00:28:32,441
Here's a list of vessels
we've destroyed

588
00:28:32,475 --> 00:28:34,944
for violating our territory.

589
00:28:42,224 --> 00:28:44,990
Where'd you get this datapadd?

590
00:28:45,028 --> 00:28:48,932
From the Bajoran colony
on our side of the anomaly.

591
00:28:48,968 --> 00:28:50,937
You should be proud.

592
00:28:50,971 --> 00:28:54,431
I hear they fought well
for a spiritual people.

593
00:28:54,477 --> 00:28:58,746
I hope we won't have to repeat
this lesson.

594
00:28:58,784 --> 00:29:02,586
Chief, lock a tractor beam
onto his ship.

595
00:29:02,623 --> 00:29:03,591
Acknowledged.

596
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:05,059
I can't establish a lock, Major.

597
00:29:05,093 --> 00:29:06,721
They must have
some kind of deflectors

598
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:07,888
we haven't seen before.

599
00:29:07,931 --> 00:29:09,729
They've entered the wormhole.

600
00:29:09,768 --> 00:29:11,031
We've lost them.

601
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:21,518
Got it.

602
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:25,184
It looks like some kind
of multiple-locking system.

603
00:29:25,226 --> 00:29:27,753
Even if I can break through
the security barrier

604
00:29:27,797 --> 00:29:29,857
how do you plan
to get off the planet?

605
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,368
We'll try to find my son.

606
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:33,234
We'll use his communicator

607
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:36,004
to signal my ship and transport
us off the surface.

608
00:29:36,043 --> 00:29:38,308
And then what?

609
00:29:40,016 --> 00:29:42,782
You're welcome to come back
to the station with us.

610
00:29:42,887 --> 00:29:46,120
I'm sure Starfleet would
like to hear anything

611
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,221
you have to tell them
about the Dominion.

612
00:29:49,264 --> 00:29:52,326
I'd be glad to tell them
all I know.

613
00:29:54,706 --> 00:29:56,641
Quark

614
00:29:56,676 --> 00:29:59,340
maybe you'd better
take a look at this.

615
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:00,815
Sure.

616
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:03,649
"Quark, be quiet.
Quark, stand watch.

617
00:30:03,688 --> 00:30:05,384
Quark, pick a lock."

618
00:30:05,424 --> 00:30:06,824
All you ever do
is order me around.

619
00:30:06,926 --> 00:30:08,827
You know, Commander,
I think I've figured out

620
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,194
why humans don't like Ferengi.

621
00:30:10,231 --> 00:30:11,529
Not now, Quark.

622
00:30:11,566 --> 00:30:13,034
The way I see it

623
00:30:13,069 --> 00:30:15,972
humans used to be a lot
like Ferengi... greedy

624
00:30:16,007 --> 00:30:18,442
acquisitive, interested
only in profit.

625
00:30:18,477 --> 00:30:20,742
We're a constant reminder
of a part of your past

626
00:30:20,782 --> 00:30:21,772
you'd like to forget.

627
00:30:21,816 --> 00:30:24,217
Quark, we don't
have time for this.

628
00:30:24,254 --> 00:30:26,587
But you're overlooking
something.

629
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:29,823
Humans used to be a lot
worse than the Ferengi...

630
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:31,125
slavery...

631
00:30:31,165 --> 00:30:33,692
concentration camps

632
00:30:33,736 --> 00:30:35,864
interstellar wars.

633
00:30:35,972 --> 00:30:38,670
We have nothing in our past

634
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:42,011
that approaches
that kind of barbarism.

635
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:43,517
You see?

636
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:45,417
We're nothing like you.

637
00:30:45,455 --> 00:30:47,253
We're better.

638
00:30:48,726 --> 00:30:51,891
Now... if you'll excuse me...

639
00:30:51,998 --> 00:30:54,901
I have a lock to pick.

640
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,205
This shouldn't be so hard.

641
00:31:03,249 --> 00:31:05,845
I just watched Chief O'Brien
run a maintenance check

642
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,823
on the <i>Mekong's</i> navigational
array a couple of weeks ago.

643
00:31:08,859 --> 00:31:10,259
Well, from the looks of things

644
00:31:10,294 --> 00:31:12,263
you haven't been
watching very closely.

645
00:31:12,297 --> 00:31:13,356
Try that one.

646
00:31:13,398 --> 00:31:15,424
I don't think that's it.

647
00:31:15,469 --> 00:31:17,461
Try it.
I have a hunch.

648
00:31:17,506 --> 00:31:19,304
All right.
Let's see.

649
00:31:19,342 --> 00:31:23,041
Warning. Warp core collapse
in ten seconds.

650
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:24,447
Nine, eight...

651
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,850
Put it back,
put it back!

652
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:28,185
...seven, six...

653
00:31:28,222 --> 00:31:33,288
Warp core containment field
stabilized.

654
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,992
Sorry.

655
00:31:35,033 --> 00:31:36,331
Wait a second...

656
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:38,167
the "G and N" relay.

657
00:31:38,205 --> 00:31:39,673
What about it?

658
00:31:39,707 --> 00:31:41,300
I think O'Brien said something

659
00:31:41,343 --> 00:31:43,539
about the autopilot
being connected

660
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,015
to the guidance
and navigational relay.

661
00:31:46,051 --> 00:31:47,883
If I could just find it...

662
00:31:47,921 --> 00:31:51,017
It was this round thing,
with this square part

663
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:52,527
on the bottom.

664
00:31:52,562 --> 00:31:54,292
I think I got it.

665
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:56,095
Is that it?

666
00:31:56,134 --> 00:31:57,727
I hope so.

667
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:00,741
Computer, what's the status
on the autopilot?

668
00:32:00,775 --> 00:32:03,712
The automatic pilot system
is not functional.

669
00:32:03,746 --> 00:32:04,873
All right!

670
00:32:04,914 --> 00:32:06,382
Yes!

671
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:09,252
Lay in a course for the wormhole
at warp eight.

672
00:32:09,288 --> 00:32:10,654
Unable to comply.

673
00:32:10,691 --> 00:32:14,686
The automatic pilot system
is not functional.

674
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:16,358
Now what?

675
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,131
I guess we'll have to try
and fly it ourselves.

676
00:32:33,372 --> 00:32:35,671
Starfleet's orders are simple.

677
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,508
Traffic through the wormhole
will be suspended

678
00:32:37,546 --> 00:32:38,946
until the <i>Odyssey</i>
can investigate

679
00:32:39,015 --> 00:32:40,381
the Jem'Hadar's threat.

680
00:32:40,418 --> 00:32:41,909
What about Benjamin
and the others?

681
00:32:41,952 --> 00:32:43,580
Don't worry, Lieutenant.

682
00:32:43,622 --> 00:32:45,955
Commander Sisko's return
is a top priority.

683
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,528
If you're going to try
to rescue them

684
00:32:47,562 --> 00:32:48,689
then we're coming with you.

685
00:32:48,731 --> 00:32:50,893
Are you sure that's wise?

686
00:32:50,934 --> 00:32:53,062
With the exception
of Major Kira and Mr. O'Brien

687
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,096
none of you have had
much combat experience.

688
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,667
We fought the Maquis.

689
00:32:57,712 --> 00:33:02,049
All the Maquis had were a pair
of lightly-armed shuttlecraft.

690
00:33:02,086 --> 00:33:05,182
I expect the Dominion
to have sharper teeth.

691
00:33:05,223 --> 00:33:06,521
Well, then you're
going to need

692
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:07,686
all the help you can get.

693
00:33:08,896 --> 00:33:12,356
Mr. O'Brien, can you equip
the two remaining runabouts

694
00:33:12,402 --> 00:33:15,532
with extra banks
of photon torpedoes?

695
00:33:15,574 --> 00:33:17,702
I already started retrofitting
their weapons systems.

696
00:33:17,744 --> 00:33:19,178
They should be ready
in a few hours.

697
00:33:19,213 --> 00:33:21,775
It should take
at least that long

698
00:33:21,816 --> 00:33:24,787
to off-load all the nonessential
personnel from the <i>Odyssey.</i>

699
00:33:24,821 --> 00:33:27,052
You were planning on doing that,
weren't you?

700
00:33:27,092 --> 00:33:28,617
Lieutenant,
have you ever thought

701
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,889
of serving on a starship?

702
00:33:29,929 --> 00:33:31,955
I'm happy where I am.

703
00:33:31,999 --> 00:33:33,399
Good.

704
00:33:33,435 --> 00:33:34,960
Major, be prepared
to leave at 1300 hours.

705
00:33:35,037 --> 00:33:36,630
I'll be aboard the <i>Odyssey</i>
if you need me.

706
00:33:36,673 --> 00:33:37,641
Yes, sir.

707
00:33:37,675 --> 00:33:39,473
I thought you said
Keogh didn't like you.

708
00:33:39,512 --> 00:33:41,811
Did I say that?

709
00:33:41,848 --> 00:33:43,339
Come on, you heard him.

710
00:33:43,384 --> 00:33:44,852
We've got three hours.

711
00:33:51,497 --> 00:33:54,195
Station security is
to be on maximum alert.

712
00:33:54,235 --> 00:33:56,602
I want random patrols
of all corridors

713
00:33:56,639 --> 00:33:58,505
and periodic sensor sweeps
of every level.

714
00:33:58,542 --> 00:34:01,479
Now, the provisional government
has agreed to send us

715
00:34:01,513 --> 00:34:04,075
a detachment
of extra security personnel.

716
00:34:04,118 --> 00:34:06,110
This outlines
how I want them deployed.

717
00:34:06,154 --> 00:34:07,213
Odo.

718
00:34:07,256 --> 00:34:08,246
Major.

719
00:34:08,291 --> 00:34:09,350
That will be all.

720
00:34:09,393 --> 00:34:11,760
Captain Keogh has moved up
our departure time.

721
00:34:11,796 --> 00:34:13,389
We have to be ready
in 15 minutes.

722
00:34:13,432 --> 00:34:15,424
I am on my way
to meet Chief O'Brien

723
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,441
and Lieutenant Dax
at the <i>Mekong</i> right now.

724
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:21,445
Are you sure that you
don't want to stay

725
00:34:21,479 --> 00:34:23,107
and oversee things
here on the station?

726
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:25,208
I don't know what we're
going to come up against

727
00:34:25,251 --> 00:34:26,276
once we're there.

728
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,619
Your duties do not
require you to come with us.

729
00:34:28,656 --> 00:34:32,355
I realize that, but I figure
while you and the others

730
00:34:32,396 --> 00:34:34,888
are trying to rescue
Sisko and the boys

731
00:34:34,933 --> 00:34:37,995
someone ought to be there
to look out for Quark.

732
00:34:38,038 --> 00:34:39,336
Quark?

733
00:34:39,374 --> 00:34:40,467
Huh.

734
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,637
You're joking.

735
00:34:41,677 --> 00:34:43,509
I thought you hated Quark.

736
00:34:43,547 --> 00:34:46,016
I do, but I'd rather
see him in jail

737
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:48,247
than in the hands
of the Dominion.

738
00:34:48,288 --> 00:34:49,756
Believe me, Major

739
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,520
if anything happened to him

740
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,687
you'd miss him, too.

741
00:34:52,729 --> 00:34:54,960
I'd be willing to take
that chance...

742
00:34:54,999 --> 00:34:56,991
but not today.

743
00:34:57,035 --> 00:34:59,972
I'd better get to the <i>Orinoco.</i>

744
00:35:00,007 --> 00:35:01,703
Odo...

745
00:35:03,245 --> 00:35:04,838
keep your head down.

746
00:35:04,881 --> 00:35:07,716
Make sure you do the same.

747
00:35:29,487 --> 00:35:32,253
Where's the welcoming
committee?

748
00:35:38,234 --> 00:35:40,032
Maybe the Jem'Hadar
were bluffing.

749
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:41,766
Or maybe it's a trap.

750
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:43,298
<i>Odyssey</i> to runabouts.

751
00:35:43,343 --> 00:35:44,402
Go ahead, Captain.

752
00:35:44,445 --> 00:35:46,346
Preliminary tachyon
scans are negative.

753
00:35:46,381 --> 00:35:48,977
We're not detecting anything
on long-range scanners

754
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:50,009
but, for all we know

755
00:35:50,053 --> 00:35:52,318
the Dominion could have
cloaking technology.

756
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,452
We'll keep our eyes open.

757
00:35:54,494 --> 00:35:56,986
I'm telling you, Jake,
we should go to warp.

758
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:59,330
First, let me get the hang
of flying at impulse.

759
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:01,167
How hard can it be?

760
00:36:01,205 --> 00:36:02,434
Are you kidding?

761
00:36:02,474 --> 00:36:05,343
You think making course
corrections manually is easy?

762
00:36:05,378 --> 00:36:07,974
But, at this speed, it'll
take weeks to get home.

763
00:36:08,016 --> 00:36:10,417
Actually, it'll
take about five years.

764
00:36:15,995 --> 00:36:18,830
Can't we reassemble
the autopilot?

765
00:36:18,867 --> 00:36:20,460
If Chief O'Brien
taught me anything

766
00:36:20,503 --> 00:36:22,699
it's that it's a lot easier
taking things apart

767
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:24,640
than putting them
back together.

768
00:36:24,676 --> 00:36:26,770
Warning. Three ships
coming out of warp.

769
00:36:26,812 --> 00:36:28,246
Where? Where?

770
00:36:28,281 --> 00:36:29,544
Right there!

771
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:33,411
<i>Mekong</i> to <i>Rio Grande.</i>

772
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:37,626
Hey, Chief, it's me, Jake.

773
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:40,155
Jake, are we glad to find you.

774
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,634
Where's your father?

775
00:36:41,669 --> 00:36:43,797
He and Quark
were taken prisoner.

776
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,207
Jake, come to a full stop.

777
00:36:46,243 --> 00:36:47,438
I'll beam aboard.

778
00:36:55,124 --> 00:36:56,922
Having trouble
getting it out of orbit?

779
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,087
How'd you know?

780
00:36:58,162 --> 00:37:00,097
Chief, we have to go back
and save my dad.

781
00:37:00,132 --> 00:37:01,100
Don't worry, son.

782
00:37:01,134 --> 00:37:02,727
That's exactly
what we're going to do.

783
00:37:09,581 --> 00:37:12,484
This is a very
sophisticated device.

784
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:14,488
Most telepathic
suppressers I've seen

785
00:37:14,522 --> 00:37:16,491
have been much bulkier.

786
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:18,551
You know, there might
be a market for this

787
00:37:18,595 --> 00:37:19,563
on the Alpha Quadrant.

788
00:37:19,597 --> 00:37:20,622
You're hurting me.

789
00:37:20,665 --> 00:37:22,691
I'm sorry, but I don't
have much to work with.

790
00:37:22,735 --> 00:37:24,203
You've been at it for hours.

791
00:37:24,238 --> 00:37:28,040
If you would just stay
still, I'd be... done.

792
00:37:28,077 --> 00:37:30,809
All right,
let's get out of here.

793
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:32,339
Stand back.

794
00:37:44,503 --> 00:37:46,438
Quark, move it!

795
00:37:53,952 --> 00:37:55,215
Thanks.

796
00:37:55,253 --> 00:37:57,119
You're welcome.

797
00:37:57,224 --> 00:37:58,715
Let's go.

798
00:38:06,738 --> 00:38:09,538
Major, I'm picking up something
on forward scanners.

799
00:38:09,576 --> 00:38:10,908
<i>Odyssey</i> to runabouts.

800
00:38:10,945 --> 00:38:12,140
Go ahead, <i>Odyssey.</i>

801
00:38:12,179 --> 00:38:14,011
We're detecting
three incoming ships

802
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,109
in attack formation.

803
00:38:15,151 --> 00:38:16,779
Shields up.
Going to Red Alert.

804
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,788
Odo, take the helm.

805
00:38:17,822 --> 00:38:19,347
I'll handle
the targeting controls.

806
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,758
Very good.

807
00:38:21,795 --> 00:38:22,922
Captain, this is the <i>Rio Grande.</i>

808
00:38:22,964 --> 00:38:23,954
Go ahead.

809
00:38:23,999 --> 00:38:25,433
Half the systems in this ship
are disabled.

810
00:38:25,467 --> 00:38:26,765
I'm going to have
to break formation.

811
00:38:26,803 --> 00:38:28,772
Understood.
Return to the wormhole.

812
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,866
We'll try to screen you
from enemy fire.

813
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,708
Well, what about my dad?

814
00:38:32,746 --> 00:38:34,476
Captain, I'd like to see
if I can get

815
00:38:34,549 --> 00:38:37,179
close enough to the planet
to locate Commander Sisko.

816
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:38,619
All right,
but you have ten minutes.

817
00:38:38,655 --> 00:38:40,180
Then I want you out of there.

818
00:38:40,224 --> 00:38:41,317
Enemy ships within range.

819
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,692
Ready to fire at your command.

820
00:38:42,729 --> 00:38:45,427
Runabouts, break formation,
attack pattern delta.

821
00:38:45,466 --> 00:38:48,528
Here they come.

822
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:02,022
I'm getting casualty reports
from decks 4, 5, 8 and 17.

823
00:39:02,059 --> 00:39:04,460
We also have a plasma leak
in our port nacelle.

824
00:39:04,497 --> 00:39:05,795
Deploy damage-control teams.

825
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:06,801
Aye, sir!

826
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:08,132
Keogh to runabouts.

827
00:39:08,169 --> 00:39:09,137
Go ahead.

828
00:39:09,171 --> 00:39:11,470
They're using some kind
of phased polaron beam

829
00:39:11,508 --> 00:39:12,806
to penetrate our shields.

830
00:39:12,844 --> 00:39:15,644
Have you tried altering
your harmonics to compensate?

831
00:39:15,682 --> 00:39:18,117
We've run through
the entire spectrum

832
00:39:18,152 --> 00:39:20,952
but none of the frequencies
were effective.

833
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:23,050
Divert shield power to weapons.

834
00:39:23,093 --> 00:39:25,494
We'll give O'Brien
five more minutes.

835
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:26,656
Then we're getting out of here!

836
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:27,667
Understood.

837
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:28,794
Dax, let's see if we can take

838
00:39:28,835 --> 00:39:29,996
some pressure off the <i>Odyssey.</i>

839
00:39:30,038 --> 00:39:31,006
We're with you.

840
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,065
Hang on.

841
00:40:01,755 --> 00:40:04,282
Wait... stop.

842
00:40:04,326 --> 00:40:06,022
I've got to start using

843
00:40:06,062 --> 00:40:08,361
one of those holosuite
exercise programs.

844
00:40:10,202 --> 00:40:11,670
He's slowing us down.

845
00:40:11,704 --> 00:40:13,172
He can hide in the underbrush.

846
00:40:13,207 --> 00:40:16,576
We'll transport him to safety
once we get to your ship.

847
00:40:16,645 --> 00:40:18,580
No, I'm not leaving
him behind.

848
00:40:18,615 --> 00:40:19,913
We never would have
gotten away

849
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:21,351
from the Jem'Hadar
without him.

850
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:23,082
Thank you, Commander.

851
00:40:23,123 --> 00:40:26,720
I'm glad someone around here
appreciates me.

852
00:40:31,436 --> 00:40:33,769
Dad!

853
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,777
This has turned into some
science project, huh, Jake?

854
00:40:36,811 --> 00:40:39,110
Uncle Quark!

855
00:40:39,149 --> 00:40:42,609
Nog, you're never going
on a field trip again.

856
00:40:44,323 --> 00:40:47,055
Take Eris back
to the passenger compartment

857
00:40:47,094 --> 00:40:48,562
and wait there.

858
00:40:48,596 --> 00:40:50,224
Jake...

859
00:40:50,266 --> 00:40:52,258
well done.

860
00:41:09,463 --> 00:41:11,990
My controls are dead.

861
00:41:12,034 --> 00:41:13,798
We've lost our sensors!

862
00:41:13,836 --> 00:41:15,304
Break off, <i>Mekong.</i>
Initiate evasive maneuvers.

863
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:17,365
We'll lay down covering fire.

864
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:18,571
Acknowledged!

865
00:41:18,611 --> 00:41:20,102
<i>Rio Grande</i> to <i>Odyssey.</i>

866
00:41:20,147 --> 00:41:21,775
We've got Sisko.

867
00:41:21,816 --> 00:41:23,284
Well done, Chief.

868
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:25,618
Damage control team
to level 7.

869
00:41:25,655 --> 00:41:26,884
Our tactical control
system is down.

870
00:41:26,924 --> 00:41:28,085
We've lost all power to phasers.

871
00:41:28,126 --> 00:41:29,856
Bridge to Engineering!

872
00:41:29,896 --> 00:41:31,330
Get that port nacelle
back on line.

873
00:41:31,365 --> 00:41:32,424
Aye, sir.

874
00:41:32,467 --> 00:41:35,438
Keogh to runabouts,
we've got what we came for.

875
00:41:35,471 --> 00:41:36,962
We'd better fall back
before we...

876
00:41:38,076 --> 00:41:40,170
Their communications array
must have been hit.

877
00:41:40,212 --> 00:41:41,805
Kira, Dax, you heard him.

878
00:41:41,848 --> 00:41:43,316
Let's get out of here.

879
00:41:49,361 --> 00:41:50,659
Major, one
of the Jem'Hadar ships

880
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:52,323
is making a direct run
at the <i>Odyssey.</i>

881
00:41:52,366 --> 00:41:53,561
Move to intercept.

882
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,582
We were retreating.

883
00:42:25,618 --> 00:42:28,145
There was no need
for a suicide run.

884
00:42:28,189 --> 00:42:30,556
They're showing us how far
they're willing to go.

885
00:42:30,592 --> 00:42:33,529
Set a course for the wormhole.

886
00:42:45,918 --> 00:42:48,616
Commander, wait.

887
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,629
We need to talk.

888
00:43:01,008 --> 00:43:02,476
I can't believe

889
00:43:02,511 --> 00:43:04,980
I'm on the other side
of the galaxy.

890
00:43:05,014 --> 00:43:07,108
You'll get used to it.

891
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:09,120
Move away from her.

892
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:16,398
I don't understand.

893
00:43:16,433 --> 00:43:19,199
I've been looking over
this collar of yours.

894
00:43:19,238 --> 00:43:21,173
I thought if I replicated it

895
00:43:21,207 --> 00:43:23,608
I might be able
to turn a tidy profit.

896
00:43:23,644 --> 00:43:25,112
Imagine my surprise

897
00:43:25,147 --> 00:43:27,616
when I discovered
there's nothing in here.

898
00:43:27,651 --> 00:43:29,950
It's just a complicated
locking device.

899
00:43:29,988 --> 00:43:33,118
Which means you could have used
your telekinetic abilities

900
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,560
at any time.

901
00:43:34,595 --> 00:43:36,894
So the question is,
why didn't you?

902
00:43:36,932 --> 00:43:39,903
You seem to already
know the answer.

903
00:43:39,937 --> 00:43:42,874
The Jem'Hadar wanted us
to escape, didn't they?

904
00:43:42,909 --> 00:43:46,540
That was the plan all along...
for us to bring you back here

905
00:43:46,581 --> 00:43:48,812
so you could spy
on the Federation.

906
00:43:48,851 --> 00:43:50,444
Well done, Commander.

907
00:43:50,487 --> 00:43:52,718
You're one of the Founders,
aren't you?

908
00:43:52,758 --> 00:43:55,227
You think the Founders
would waste their time with you?

909
00:43:55,261 --> 00:43:56,627
Constable.

910
00:43:56,664 --> 00:44:00,261
Madam, if you'll come with us.

911
00:44:00,303 --> 00:44:02,830
You have no idea
what's begun here.

912
00:44:05,744 --> 00:44:06,803
Chief!

913
00:44:06,847 --> 00:44:08,782
I'm picking up
a transporter signature

914
00:44:08,816 --> 00:44:09,943
but I can't trace it.

915
00:44:09,985 --> 00:44:11,954
She didn't rematerialize
anywhere on the station

916
00:44:11,988 --> 00:44:13,251
and there are no ships nearby.

917
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:14,349
Then where is she?

918
00:44:14,392 --> 00:44:15,451
She'll be back.

919
00:44:15,494 --> 00:44:17,690
The question is
who she'll bring with her.

920
00:44:17,764 --> 00:44:20,701
If the Dominion
comes through the wormhole

921
00:44:20,735 --> 00:44:23,102
the first battle
will be fought here

922
00:44:23,139 --> 00:44:26,338
and I intend
to be ready for them.
