1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:06,396
Captain's Log, Stardate 49904.2.

2
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:08,637
After driving away
Breen privateers

3
00:00:08,677 --> 00:00:10,875
from the Bajoran colony
of Free Haven

4
00:00:10,915 --> 00:00:13,409
we are returning
to Deep Space 9.

5
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,588
When I was Lela Dax,
I went through the same thing.

6
00:00:18,632 --> 00:00:20,796
Every night, I'd
tuck in my son Ahjess

7
00:00:20,837 --> 00:00:23,206
and two hours later,
he'd crawl into bed with me.

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,077
I don't think I slept
through a night for weeks.

9
00:00:26,115 --> 00:00:29,680
Weeks? Molly's been doing this
for two months already.

10
00:00:29,724 --> 00:00:32,628
She just needs
a little attention.

11
00:00:32,663 --> 00:00:34,223
Dax is right.

12
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,826
I'd say she's jealous.

13
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,068
She knows that you and Keiko
are going to have a baby soon.

14
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:39,840
What makes you
such an expert on children?

15
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:42,350
First in my class
in pediatric medicine.

16
00:00:42,385 --> 00:00:43,877
I wouldn't sit there

17
00:00:43,922 --> 00:00:45,516
- if I were you.
- Why?

18
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:46,686
Miles spill something again?

19
00:00:46,728 --> 00:00:47,696
It's Worf's seat.

20
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,994
He'll be here in a minute.

21
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:50,023
Just because Worf

22
00:00:50,068 --> 00:00:51,731
lives on the <i>Defiant</i> full-time

23
00:00:51,772 --> 00:00:54,005
doesn't give him proprietary
rights in the Mess Hall.

24
00:00:54,044 --> 00:00:55,638
No one says it does.

25
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,651
He just likes that seat.

26
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:07,764
Prune juice, extra large.

27
00:01:26,715 --> 00:01:29,312
Have a seat, Commander.

28
00:01:31,927 --> 00:01:33,726
Thank you.

29
00:01:35,334 --> 00:01:38,796
All senior staff, report
to the Bridge immediately.

30
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,850
You'd better have
a look at this.

31
00:01:59,554 --> 00:02:02,253
Concentrate on the fires
in Section 13.

32
00:02:02,294 --> 00:02:04,390
We have to keep them away
from the plasma conduits.

33
00:02:04,431 --> 00:02:07,666
Has anyone seen
my brother Rom?!

34
00:02:07,705 --> 00:02:08,934
He told me he was
going to be working

35
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:10,068
in one of the upper pylons
today.

36
00:02:10,111 --> 00:02:11,136
He's fine.

37
00:02:11,179 --> 00:02:12,842
I saw him with one
of the damage-control teams

38
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,044
on Level 5.

39
00:02:14,086 --> 00:02:15,646
Ah, what a relief.

40
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,321
Wait till I find him...
I'll kill him!

41
00:02:18,396 --> 00:02:20,229
For scaring me like this.

42
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:22,897
Major, here's a preliminary list
of the stolen equipment.

43
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:23,907
Report, Major.

44
00:02:23,942 --> 00:02:25,639
It was a Jem'Hadar strike team.

45
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,546
They beamed aboard
from a civilian transport

46
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:28,984
disabled communications
and weapons

47
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:31,718
set off an explosive device
in Upper Pylon 3.

48
00:02:31,758 --> 00:02:32,885
Fought a number of small...

49
00:02:32,927 --> 00:02:33,986
This one's gone.

50
00:02:35,934 --> 00:02:37,494
Spinal fracture

51
00:02:37,538 --> 00:02:39,064
and severe trauma
to the cranial meninges.

52
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:42,138
They raided the Science Lab,
the reactor-control facility

53
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:43,171
and several cargo bays.

54
00:02:43,217 --> 00:02:46,281
"Microfusion initiators,
photonic amplifiers

55
00:02:46,323 --> 00:02:47,587
EPS power stabilizers."

56
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:49,392
They were out of here
and through the wormhole

57
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,591
before we knew what hit us.

58
00:02:50,634 --> 00:02:53,037
Constable, how many casualties
do we have?

59
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:54,973
So far, 18 confirmed dead,
31 missing

60
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,411
and over a hundred wounded.

61
00:02:56,445 --> 00:02:58,278
How long ago did
the Jem'Hadar leave?

62
00:02:58,317 --> 00:03:00,720
Uh... 45 minutes at the most.

63
00:03:00,756 --> 00:03:02,350
That means their ion trail
hasn't decayed yet.

64
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:03,484
We could still follow them.

65
00:03:03,528 --> 00:03:05,521
I intend to do more than that.

66
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:06,726
Sisko to <i>Defiant.</i>

67
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:07,794
Prepare for departure.

68
00:03:07,837 --> 00:03:09,466
I'm going to stay here,
take care of the wounded.

69
00:03:09,508 --> 00:03:10,476
That includes you.

70
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,979
The station's yours, Major.

71
00:03:12,013 --> 00:03:12,981
Contact Starfleet.

72
00:03:13,015 --> 00:03:14,678
Tell them to get
some ships out here

73
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,279
just in case
this is a diversion.

74
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:17,689
Understood.

75
00:03:17,726 --> 00:03:20,630
Constable, you're with us.

76
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:22,896
Sisko to <i>Defiant.</i>

77
00:03:22,937 --> 00:03:24,930
Three to beam out.

78
00:05:53,934 --> 00:05:55,233
What do you see, Dax?

79
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,239
Nothing good.

80
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,867
Their ion trail
is getting fainter.

81
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,143
The Jem'Hadar must be
emitting a magneton pulse

82
00:06:00,182 --> 00:06:01,241
to cover their tracks.

83
00:06:01,284 --> 00:06:02,947
Keep on them.
I want that ship.

84
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:03,956
Frankly, I'm surprised

85
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,823
something like this
hasn't happened sooner.

86
00:06:05,861 --> 00:06:07,387
Being at the edge
of the wormhole

87
00:06:07,464 --> 00:06:09,263
makes Deep Space 9
a tempting target.

88
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,865
Sometimes, I wish we
could have the <i>Defiant</i>

89
00:06:11,908 --> 00:06:14,778
standing guard over the
station 26 hours a day.

90
00:06:14,813 --> 00:06:16,874
Restricting the <i>Defiant</i>
to guard duty

91
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,411
would be a serious mistake.

92
00:06:18,455 --> 00:06:19,423
You wouldn't say that

93
00:06:19,457 --> 00:06:20,949
if you had family
living in the station.

94
00:06:20,994 --> 00:06:23,830
Perhaps, but adopting
a siege mentality

95
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:25,997
is ultimately self-defeating.

96
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,009
I've got something.

97
00:06:28,043 --> 00:06:30,036
Bearing 057 mark 009.

98
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:31,607
Red Alert.

99
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,709
On screen.

100
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,863
A Jem'Hadar warship.

101
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,064
This cannot be the vessel
we are looking for.

102
00:06:41,105 --> 00:06:44,306
Major Kira said
the Jem'Hadar strike team

103
00:06:44,346 --> 00:06:46,476
that attacked the station
used a transport ship.

104
00:06:46,516 --> 00:06:49,147
Captain, that warship's
in pretty bad shape.

105
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:51,250
Looks like someone's been using
it for target practice.

106
00:06:51,294 --> 00:06:53,857
They're transmitting
a broad-band distress signal.

107
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:55,128
It could be a trap.

108
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:56,661
How many crew members aboard?

109
00:06:56,705 --> 00:06:57,969
I'm reading seven life signs.

110
00:06:58,009 --> 00:06:59,740
You won't be reading them
for long.

111
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:02,683
Their reactor's
about to go critical.

112
00:07:03,988 --> 00:07:07,052
Chief, have a security detail
report to the transporter bay.

113
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:08,655
Odo, Commander Worf,
you're with me.

114
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:19,081
Transporter protocol five.

115
00:07:22,295 --> 00:07:23,696
Sisko to Bridge.

116
00:07:23,732 --> 00:07:24,700
Drop cloak.

117
00:07:24,734 --> 00:07:26,851
Engage.

118
00:07:30,859 --> 00:07:32,294
Reinstate cloak.

119
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:34,698
If you're looking
for your weapons...

120
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:36,636
they were removed in transport.

121
00:07:36,672 --> 00:07:39,041
Even without weapons...

122
00:07:40,046 --> 00:07:42,176
we're more than a match for you.

123
00:07:42,251 --> 00:07:45,087
I would not be
so certain of that.

124
00:07:45,123 --> 00:07:46,888
A Klingon.

125
00:07:46,928 --> 00:07:48,454
And the traitor.

126
00:07:48,498 --> 00:07:50,127
The Founders will be pleased.

127
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,661
Omet'iklan.

128
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:56,377
Control your men.

129
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,886
These people saved our lives.

130
00:07:58,921 --> 00:08:00,014
And for that

131
00:08:00,056 --> 00:08:01,491
we shall take advantage
of their mistake.

132
00:08:01,526 --> 00:08:04,157
You'll do nothing
without my approval.

133
00:08:04,232 --> 00:08:06,065
My apologies, Captain.

134
00:08:06,104 --> 00:08:08,074
I'm afraid the Jem'Hadar
are sadly deficient

135
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:09,509
in the social graces.

136
00:08:09,544 --> 00:08:11,708
Two hours ago,
my station was attacked

137
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:13,343
by a Jem'Hadar strike team.

138
00:08:13,386 --> 00:08:15,322
I know...
they attacked us, too.

139
00:08:15,357 --> 00:08:17,487
Why would your own people
attack you?

140
00:08:17,528 --> 00:08:18,827
Tell them nothing.

141
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,835
This is not their concern.

142
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:24,138
Your next allowance of white
will be in two hours.

143
00:08:24,176 --> 00:08:25,303
If you want it on time

144
00:08:25,346 --> 00:08:27,407
you will be quiet
and do as you're told.

145
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,013
Captain...

146
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:33,786
you and I should talk...

147
00:08:36,603 --> 00:08:38,436
in private?

148
00:08:40,212 --> 00:08:42,683
If you have something
to say to me, make it quick.

149
00:08:42,717 --> 00:08:45,815
Captain Benjamin Sisko.

150
00:08:45,857 --> 00:08:48,260
I feel honored.

151
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,266
Your psychographic profile
is required reading

152
00:08:51,369 --> 00:08:53,032
for Vorta Field Supervisors.

153
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:56,513
I probably know things about you
you don't know yourself.

154
00:08:56,547 --> 00:08:59,714
If you're trying to impress me,
you can forget it.

155
00:09:01,391 --> 00:09:03,862
What would you say...

156
00:09:03,897 --> 00:09:06,630
if I offered to make you

157
00:09:06,669 --> 00:09:10,542
absolute ruler
of the Federation?

158
00:09:10,578 --> 00:09:11,546
No President

159
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,345
no Starfleet Chief of Staff...

160
00:09:13,384 --> 00:09:15,251
just you.

161
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:18,089
I'd say your psychographic
profile of me

162
00:09:18,128 --> 00:09:20,064
isn't as good as you think.

163
00:09:22,671 --> 00:09:24,470
Just...

164
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:26,206
doing my job...

165
00:09:26,246 --> 00:09:28,809
trying to build a bridge

166
00:09:28,852 --> 00:09:32,451
between the Dominion
and a potential ally.

167
00:09:32,493 --> 00:09:33,860
After all,
wouldn't it be much simpler

168
00:09:33,896 --> 00:09:35,992
if the Dominion
and the Federation

169
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:39,030
could reach some mutual
beneficial understanding

170
00:09:39,074 --> 00:09:41,238
without resorting
to the unpleasantness

171
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,474
of military conflict?

172
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,246
I want to know how to find

173
00:09:44,285 --> 00:09:46,813
the Jem'Hadar
who attacked my station.

174
00:09:46,857 --> 00:09:50,194
If you want to build a bridge,
why don't you start there?

175
00:09:51,602 --> 00:09:53,572
I can lead you to them.

176
00:09:53,606 --> 00:09:56,807
But... there's something
I need in exchange.

177
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:57,871
What's that?

178
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,852
I want you to help
me eliminate them.

179
00:09:59,886 --> 00:10:02,619
The Jem'Hadar
that attacked your station

180
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:03,684
are renegades.

181
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:04,697
They've turned their back

182
00:10:04,731 --> 00:10:06,257
on their oath of allegiance
to the Dominion

183
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:08,271
and it's my job to see
to it they're punished.

184
00:10:08,305 --> 00:10:09,534
Why do you need my help?

185
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:12,274
You could send a fleet of
Jem'Hadar warships after them.

186
00:10:12,314 --> 00:10:14,547
I'm afraid
we don't have the time.

187
00:10:15,621 --> 00:10:17,523
Captain...

188
00:10:17,558 --> 00:10:21,259
are you familiar
with the Iconians?

189
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:24,570
They controlled
a vast interstellar empire

190
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:26,510
about 200,000 years ago.

191
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:30,418
What's important is how the
Iconians controlled that empire.

192
00:10:30,521 --> 00:10:31,785
The gateways.

193
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:34,591
Exactly.

194
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,031
Sophisticated transporters

195
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:38,299
that allowed them
to move instantaneously

196
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:41,800
from one planet to another,
from one solar system to another

197
00:10:41,845 --> 00:10:43,542
without the use of starships.

198
00:10:43,582 --> 00:10:45,381
What does any of this
have to do with me?

199
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,855
Dominion scientists

200
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:50,660
recently discovered a gateway
on one of our outlying worlds.

201
00:10:50,698 --> 00:10:52,931
We sent a team of scientists
to restore it

202
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,464
but their Jem'Hadar guards
rebelled

203
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:59,108
and are now trying to complete
the gateway themselves.

204
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:02,146
These... renegade Jem'Hadar

205
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,251
stole some equipment
from my station...

206
00:11:04,294 --> 00:11:06,788
EPS power stabilizers

207
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,735
microfusion initiators

208
00:11:08,772 --> 00:11:11,437
photonic amplifiers.

209
00:11:11,477 --> 00:11:13,607
I would say it's very possible
they're going

210
00:11:13,648 --> 00:11:16,449
to use that equipment to help
them complete the gateway.

211
00:11:16,488 --> 00:11:17,923
You...

212
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:21,420
understand
the nature of our dilemma.

213
00:11:23,003 --> 00:11:26,876
If the Jem'Hadar are able
to make the gateway operational

214
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:29,941
they'll become
virtually invincible.

215
00:11:29,984 --> 00:11:31,009
Our experts predict

216
00:11:31,053 --> 00:11:32,647
the renegades
would gather support

217
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,457
from other Jem'Hadar units,
launch a general insurrection

218
00:11:35,497 --> 00:11:38,493
and effect a complete takeover
of the Dominion

219
00:11:38,536 --> 00:11:39,869
in less than a year.

220
00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:44,242
None of which is my problem.

221
00:11:44,282 --> 00:11:46,047
That's very short-sighted
of you, Captain.

222
00:11:46,086 --> 00:11:48,250
Think about it.

223
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,264
If the Jem'Hadar seize
control of the Dominion

224
00:11:51,298 --> 00:11:52,961
there'll be no stopping them.

225
00:11:53,002 --> 00:11:54,335
Even shutting down the wormhole

226
00:11:54,371 --> 00:11:56,034
won't protect
the Alpha Quadrant.

227
00:11:56,075 --> 00:11:57,304
With the gateway

228
00:11:57,345 --> 00:12:00,010
they could put a million
Jem'Hadar warriors

229
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,681
on any Federation planet
instantaneously.

230
00:12:04,326 --> 00:12:06,228
Would you care to see
our projections

231
00:12:06,264 --> 00:12:07,631
of Federation casualties?

232
00:12:10,206 --> 00:12:13,304
Couldn't the Founders
just order them to surrender?

233
00:12:13,346 --> 00:12:15,179
From what I know,
the Jem'Hadar have been

234
00:12:15,217 --> 00:12:18,121
genetically engineered
to obey them.

235
00:12:20,729 --> 00:12:23,998
The Founders' ability
to control the Jem'Hadar

236
00:12:24,037 --> 00:12:25,939
has been somewhat...

237
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:31,475
overstated.

238
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,518
Otherwise, we never would have
had to addict them to the white.

239
00:12:35,562 --> 00:12:38,363
Sounds like the Dominion
isn't quite as stable

240
00:12:38,401 --> 00:12:40,428
as you'd like us to believe.

241
00:12:40,472 --> 00:12:45,381
The Dominion has endured
for 2,000 years

242
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,045
and will continue to endure

243
00:12:47,087 --> 00:12:51,222
long after the Federation
has crumbled into dust.

244
00:12:51,262 --> 00:12:53,460
But we'll leave that to history.

245
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:56,599
Right now, we have
a more pressing concern.

246
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:02,745
The gateway must be destroyed.

247
00:13:02,788 --> 00:13:04,781
Agreed?

248
00:13:11,808 --> 00:13:13,801
Agreed.

249
00:13:18,623 --> 00:13:20,149
So let me get this straight.

250
00:13:20,193 --> 00:13:21,560
We're going to work
with the Jem'Hadar

251
00:13:21,596 --> 00:13:22,860
to fight the Jem'Hadar.

252
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:24,766
I don't relish this idea either

253
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,603
but we don't have
much of a choice.

254
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:27,835
I was on the mission

255
00:13:27,876 --> 00:13:29,903
that discovered
the Iconian homeworld.

256
00:13:29,948 --> 00:13:31,941
We were forced to destroy
the gateway we found there

257
00:13:31,985 --> 00:13:34,115
rather than let it fall
into the hands of the Romulans

258
00:13:34,157 --> 00:13:37,928
and Starfleet Command
supported our decision.

259
00:13:37,965 --> 00:13:39,764
If they didn't want the Romulans
to get a hold of it

260
00:13:39,803 --> 00:13:41,796
I'm sure they don't want the
Jem'Hadar to have it either.

261
00:13:41,841 --> 00:13:42,934
What are we supposed to do?

262
00:13:42,976 --> 00:13:44,878
Give Omet'iklan and his men
their weapons back

263
00:13:44,914 --> 00:13:46,645
and then hope
they don't point them at us?

264
00:13:46,685 --> 00:13:47,949
They're not going to get

265
00:13:47,987 --> 00:13:50,652
their hands on any weapons
until we reach our target.

266
00:13:50,761 --> 00:13:53,597
How do we know that these
Jem'Hadar can be trusted?

267
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,603
They must realize
that controlling the gateway

268
00:13:55,638 --> 00:13:57,267
would mean freedom
for their people.

269
00:13:57,308 --> 00:13:58,333
According to Weyoun

270
00:13:58,377 --> 00:14:00,210
they don't know anything
about the gateway.

271
00:14:00,248 --> 00:14:01,273
They think that this

272
00:14:01,316 --> 00:14:03,252
is just a routine
search-and-destroy mission...

273
00:14:03,288 --> 00:14:05,725
find the renegade Jem'Hadar,
eliminate them

274
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,989
and their base.

275
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:10,491
You are asking us to lie
to them about our mission.

276
00:14:10,537 --> 00:14:12,302
It is not honorable.

277
00:14:12,341 --> 00:14:13,640
There's a lot of things

278
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,145
about this mission
that bother me.

279
00:14:15,181 --> 00:14:17,652
But lying to the Jem'Hadar
is not on top of my list.

280
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:20,555
If the Jem'Hadar find out
that we've deceived them...

281
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:22,255
They're not going
to find out anything.

282
00:14:22,297 --> 00:14:24,290
Well, they won't hear it
from me.

283
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:26,999
There'll be a joint
briefing session at 1900 hours.

284
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,775
Followed by a get-to-know-you
buffet at 1930.

285
00:14:30,815 --> 00:14:32,945
And I forgot my dress uniform.

286
00:14:40,035 --> 00:14:42,028
Enter.

287
00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:48,219
You requested my presence.

288
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,521
It seems we're going
to be working together.

289
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:52,152
So I'm told.

290
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:53,528
Luckily for you

291
00:14:53,565 --> 00:14:56,970
the only thing I despise
more than the Federation

292
00:14:57,006 --> 00:14:58,635
is a Jem'Hadar soldier

293
00:14:58,676 --> 00:15:01,170
who breaks his vow
of allegiance.

294
00:15:01,215 --> 00:15:03,311
I'm glad you see it that way.

295
00:15:03,353 --> 00:15:06,986
Now... I have a few things
I want to make clear.

296
00:15:07,028 --> 00:15:09,659
First, this is my ship
and my command

297
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,937
which means I give the orders,
not you and not Weyoun.

298
00:15:13,976 --> 00:15:16,345
What's more, I'm holding you
personally responsible

299
00:15:16,381 --> 00:15:18,112
for the actions of your men.

300
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:19,678
If I have a problem with them

301
00:15:19,722 --> 00:15:22,718
you're the one who's going
to have to answer for it.

302
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,359
That's as it should be.

303
00:15:25,401 --> 00:15:27,200
After all...

304
00:15:27,238 --> 00:15:28,730
I'm the First.

305
00:15:28,809 --> 00:15:30,472
As far as I'm concerned

306
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,919
on this mission, I'm the First.

307
00:15:33,052 --> 00:15:36,355
Until the traitors are found
and terminated.

308
00:15:37,596 --> 00:15:38,791
After that...

309
00:15:40,268 --> 00:15:42,261
we shall see.

310
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,249
Am I dismissed?

311
00:15:48,286 --> 00:15:50,313
For the time being.

312
00:15:58,074 --> 00:16:00,739
According to Dominion
Intelligence, the Jem'Hadar

313
00:16:00,781 --> 00:16:02,375
have established
a base camp here.

314
00:16:02,418 --> 00:16:03,819
The interior of the structure

315
00:16:03,853 --> 00:16:05,914
is riddled
with a network of corridors

316
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,621
and interlocking chambers.

317
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:12,229
Our primary objective
is to destroy the Jem'Hadar arms

318
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:15,245
and supply cache
in this chamber.

319
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,252
The trick...
will be getting there.

320
00:16:18,286 --> 00:16:20,416
We can't beam directly
into the structure

321
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:22,928
which means we'll have
to fight our way in.

322
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:25,490
Jem'Hadar tactics dictate
at least 27 soldiers

323
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:28,438
are stationed inside
the base camp at all times.

324
00:16:28,475 --> 00:16:30,138
Nine will patrol the perimeter.

325
00:16:30,212 --> 00:16:33,549
And additional troops are
deployed throughout the city.

326
00:16:33,586 --> 00:16:35,989
How many renegades are there
altogether?

327
00:16:36,024 --> 00:16:38,621
162 in the original garrison.

328
00:16:38,663 --> 00:16:43,128
We killed at least 12
during the initial rebellion.

329
00:16:43,173 --> 00:16:44,938
Well, that still leaves 150.

330
00:16:44,978 --> 00:16:47,449
Just between you and me,
Captain, I think

331
00:16:47,483 --> 00:16:48,451
we're a little outnumbered.

332
00:16:48,485 --> 00:16:49,612
Wouldn't it be simpler

333
00:16:49,654 --> 00:16:51,385
to take out the base from orbit?

334
00:16:51,424 --> 00:16:52,984
A couple of quantum torpedoes

335
00:16:53,028 --> 00:16:55,295
should be enough
to level the entire area.

336
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,200
Unfortunately,
that's not an option.

337
00:16:57,304 --> 00:17:00,539
The central structure
is composed of solid neutronium.

338
00:17:00,578 --> 00:17:03,072
Even a direct hit
from a quantum torpedo

339
00:17:03,117 --> 00:17:05,611
wouldn't necessarily
destroy our objective.

340
00:17:05,656 --> 00:17:07,820
Which means we have
to go in ourselves.

341
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,262
As it should be.

342
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:10,961
It is our duty to punish

343
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:13,871
those who would break
their vow of loyalty.

344
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:16,971
Are you accusing me
of something?

345
00:17:17,014 --> 00:17:19,281
It is not for us
to accuse a God

346
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,153
of betraying heaven.

347
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,491
The Gods themselves...

348
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:25,727
will sit in judgment over you.

349
00:17:25,766 --> 00:17:26,825
I'm no God

350
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:29,204
and neither are the Founders.

351
00:17:29,242 --> 00:17:32,738
The sooner you realize that,
the better off you'll be.

352
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:41,197
We've chosen a beam-in site here
in this wooded area.

353
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:42,703
That'll give us a chance

354
00:17:42,738 --> 00:17:45,711
to evaluate the situation
before proceeding.

355
00:17:45,744 --> 00:17:47,874
Our first objective will be

356
00:17:47,915 --> 00:17:51,650
to secure the main entrance
to the ziggurat.

357
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,355
Neutralizing nine guards
before one of them

358
00:17:54,397 --> 00:17:56,595
can raise an alarm
will be difficult.

359
00:17:56,634 --> 00:17:58,501
It's as you said.

360
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:03,004
The Klingon will to fight
pales in comparison to our own.

361
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,017
Yes.

362
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:06,352
He has the look of a warrior

363
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:08,120
but the heart of a coward.

364
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,529
If you would like
to test my courage, l...

365
00:18:10,565 --> 00:18:12,364
All right, that's enough.

366
00:18:12,402 --> 00:18:16,867
One day the Klingon Empire
will fall before the Jem'Hadar

367
00:18:16,913 --> 00:18:18,883
and when that day comes

368
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:23,018
and piles of Klingons
lie dead at my feet

369
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:25,860
I will think of you,
standing here

370
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:28,928
impotent and weak,
and I will laugh.

371
00:18:28,972 --> 00:18:30,407
All right! I said that's enough!

372
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,410
Worf, let him go!

373
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,879
Second!
Release the Klingon

374
00:18:32,914 --> 00:18:35,545
or I will kill you
where you stand.

375
00:18:38,292 --> 00:18:42,097
Now, the two of you,
as you were.

376
00:18:42,135 --> 00:18:44,572
I promise, you'll both

377
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,600
have more fight
than you can handle

378
00:18:46,644 --> 00:18:47,873
before this is over.

379
00:19:09,628 --> 00:19:11,188
Let's go.

380
00:19:13,203 --> 00:19:14,695
I'm right with you.

381
00:19:25,028 --> 00:19:26,018
Worf!

382
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:28,859
Go.

383
00:19:36,187 --> 00:19:37,212
Ready.

384
00:19:37,256 --> 00:19:38,782
Wait.
The room's not secure.

385
00:19:38,826 --> 00:19:40,159
We have to find the third guard.

386
00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:41,631
I do not see him.

387
00:19:41,665 --> 00:19:43,100
He's here somewhere.

388
00:19:43,135 --> 00:19:44,364
I know.

389
00:19:44,405 --> 00:19:46,569
We're supposed to be
on our way out

390
00:19:46,609 --> 00:19:47,668
by now.

391
00:19:49,215 --> 00:19:50,650
Where is he?

392
00:19:52,322 --> 00:19:54,053
We're running
out of time, Commander.

393
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:55,391
The third Jem'Hadar guard...

394
00:19:55,496 --> 00:19:57,227
he is still here somewhere.

395
00:19:57,266 --> 00:19:59,396
Look for a slight
rippling effect.

396
00:19:59,438 --> 00:20:00,805
We know what we're looking for.

397
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,865
We just can't find it.

398
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,179
We're dead.

399
00:20:05,217 --> 00:20:06,412
That's correct.

400
00:20:06,486 --> 00:20:08,889
The Jem'Hadar defense grid
is now in operation.

401
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:10,952
Automated weapon systems
have killed everyone

402
00:20:10,996 --> 00:20:12,556
in this room.

403
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,536
Your crew failed
in their mission.

404
00:20:14,571 --> 00:20:16,769
Well, you might as well tell us,
where's the other one?

405
00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:18,108
There was no third guard.

406
00:20:18,145 --> 00:20:19,113
I don't understand.

407
00:20:19,147 --> 00:20:20,616
You told me
that Jem'Hadar soldiers

408
00:20:20,651 --> 00:20:22,052
always operate
in teams of three.

409
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:23,785
In battle, nothing is certain.

410
00:20:23,825 --> 00:20:25,727
You should have
armed the explosives

411
00:20:25,762 --> 00:20:27,561
as soon as you were in position.

412
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,000
We had to be sure
the room was secured.

413
00:20:29,036 --> 00:20:30,265
Otherwise, someone could have

414
00:20:30,306 --> 00:20:32,242
disarmed the explosives
the moment we left.

415
00:20:32,276 --> 00:20:34,212
If you couldn't secure the room

416
00:20:34,247 --> 00:20:36,114
you should not plan
on leaving it.

417
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:39,022
You want us to blow the place up
while we're still in it?

418
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:40,584
This is a waste of time.

419
00:20:40,628 --> 00:20:41,961
They'll never succeed

420
00:20:41,998 --> 00:20:45,335
as long as they value
their lives more than victory.

421
00:20:45,372 --> 00:20:47,137
There's something
to be said for soldiers

422
00:20:47,176 --> 00:20:48,269
who aren't afraid to die.

423
00:20:48,311 --> 00:20:49,279
Oh, I don't know.

424
00:20:49,313 --> 00:20:51,146
I've found that
nothing keeps me alert

425
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:52,882
quite like a healthy
fear of death.

426
00:20:52,922 --> 00:20:54,151
Keep practicing.

427
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:55,717
The two of you, with me.

428
00:21:02,342 --> 00:21:03,777
One of the reasons
for these drills

429
00:21:03,813 --> 00:21:05,943
is to help our crews
learn to work together.

430
00:21:05,983 --> 00:21:07,782
Constantly showing
contempt for my people

431
00:21:07,822 --> 00:21:09,257
isn't making it any easier.

432
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,486
Would you prefer I lied?

433
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:11,860
What I'd like

434
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,663
is for you to at least
maintain the pretense

435
00:21:14,703 --> 00:21:16,229
that we're on the same side.

436
00:21:16,273 --> 00:21:20,909
Captain, I understand
your concerns

437
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,442
and so does Omet'iklan.

438
00:21:22,487 --> 00:21:25,357
Deck Five, Section One.

439
00:21:25,393 --> 00:21:27,830
The only way my troops
can come to respect your crew

440
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:30,839
is to fight alongside them...

441
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,101
mixed teams

442
00:21:32,142 --> 00:21:33,771
in every aspect of the mission.

443
00:21:33,812 --> 00:21:35,304
That's not practical.

444
00:21:35,349 --> 00:21:36,544
Why not?

445
00:21:36,618 --> 00:21:39,750
Are you questioning my decision?

446
00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:41,091
You fool.

447
00:21:41,127 --> 00:21:45,034
My men and I,
we know all about the gateway.

448
00:21:47,408 --> 00:21:49,902
Halt turbolift.

449
00:21:49,947 --> 00:21:52,316
Looks like your secret's out.

450
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,585
How do you know
about the gateway?

451
00:21:54,624 --> 00:21:56,594
It doesn't matter how we know.

452
00:21:56,695 --> 00:21:58,893
The point is, we know.

453
00:21:58,934 --> 00:22:01,303
You think you have to lie to us

454
00:22:01,339 --> 00:22:03,833
and use the white
to ensure our loyalty.

455
00:22:03,878 --> 00:22:06,247
But the fact is, we are
more loyal to the Founders

456
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,185
than the Vorta ever will be.

457
00:22:08,221 --> 00:22:10,692
It is the reason
for our existence.

458
00:22:11,928 --> 00:22:14,058
It is the core...

459
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,264
of our being.

460
00:22:16,305 --> 00:22:18,776
There's an entire company
of Jem'Hadar

461
00:22:18,811 --> 00:22:22,046
down on Vandros IV
who would disagree with you.

462
00:22:22,085 --> 00:22:24,249
And for that, they will die.

463
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,392
Mixed teams, it is.

464
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:31,597
But let's get
one thing straight.

465
00:22:31,705 --> 00:22:34,108
This isn't going to be
a suicide mission.

466
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,773
As far as I'm concerned

467
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:38,115
everyone who goes in,
comes back out...

468
00:22:38,153 --> 00:22:40,020
Starfleet and Jem'Hadar alike.

469
00:22:40,057 --> 00:22:42,620
Your concern for life
is touching.

470
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:46,430
Let's hope it doesn't stop us
from achieving...

471
00:22:46,471 --> 00:22:48,669
our objectives.

472
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:53,813
Computer, reactivate turbolift.

473
00:23:05,947 --> 00:23:08,008
Am I really that interesting?

474
00:23:08,052 --> 00:23:10,853
You've been standing
there staring at me

475
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:12,520
for the last two hours.

476
00:23:12,562 --> 00:23:14,623
You are part of my combat team.

477
00:23:14,734 --> 00:23:17,570
I must learn to understand
your behavior

478
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:19,473
anticipate your actions.

479
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:22,745
There must be something
you'd rather do.

480
00:23:22,784 --> 00:23:24,515
Maybe get some sleep?

481
00:23:24,554 --> 00:23:26,154
We don't sleep.

482
00:23:27,624 --> 00:23:29,925
How about getting
something to eat?

483
00:23:29,963 --> 00:23:33,403
The white is
the only thing we need.

484
00:23:33,437 --> 00:23:35,339
You don't sleep...

485
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:36,603
you don't eat.

486
00:23:37,946 --> 00:23:40,747
What do you do for relaxation?

487
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:44,385
Relaxation
would only make us weak.

488
00:23:44,427 --> 00:23:46,294
Well, you people
are no fun at all.

489
00:23:46,332 --> 00:23:48,234
I'm glad I'm not
a Jem'Hadar woman.

490
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:51,106
There are no Jem'Hadar women.

491
00:23:51,142 --> 00:23:53,238
So what do you do?

492
00:23:53,281 --> 00:23:54,580
Lay eggs?

493
00:23:54,616 --> 00:23:57,919
Jem'Hadar are bred
in birthing chambers.

494
00:23:57,957 --> 00:24:02,696
We are able to fight within
three days of our emergence.

495
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:04,033
Lucky you.

496
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:07,238
So let me get this straight.

497
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:10,740
No sleep, no food...

498
00:24:10,786 --> 00:24:12,380
no women.

499
00:24:12,423 --> 00:24:15,521
No wonder you're so angry.

500
00:24:15,563 --> 00:24:19,298
After 30 or 40 years of that,
I'd be angry, too.

501
00:24:19,338 --> 00:24:23,005
No Jem'Hadar
has ever lived 30 years.

502
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:25,381
How old are you?

503
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:27,387
I am eight.

504
00:24:28,591 --> 00:24:31,290
I would have guessed
at least 15.

505
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,633
Hmm.
Few Jem'Hadar live that long.

506
00:24:34,671 --> 00:24:40,047
If we reach 20, we are
considered honored elders.

507
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:46,424
How old are you?

508
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,937
I stopped counting at 300.

509
00:24:54,615 --> 00:24:56,380
You don't look it.

510
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,253
Thank you.

511
00:25:00,127 --> 00:25:01,926
No women?
I'm not surprised.

512
00:25:01,964 --> 00:25:04,401
Personally, I envy them.

513
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:08,070
I mean, their ability
to go without sleep.

514
00:25:08,112 --> 00:25:09,945
I'm sure I could
be more productive

515
00:25:09,982 --> 00:25:12,146
if I didn't have
to regenerate every day.

516
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,316
What is the point
of doing battle

517
00:25:14,358 --> 00:25:16,727
if you cannot enjoy
the fruits of your victory?

518
00:25:16,764 --> 00:25:18,256
You mean sleep?

519
00:25:18,301 --> 00:25:22,106
No, I mean spending long nights
singing songs of your deeds.

520
00:25:22,142 --> 00:25:24,169
Good food, good drink.

521
00:25:24,214 --> 00:25:25,478
And good women.

522
00:25:25,516 --> 00:25:27,680
Now, we consider Klingon women

523
00:25:27,721 --> 00:25:29,418
our partners in battle.

524
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:31,861
They are the mothers
of our children.

525
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,958
And a lot of fun
at parties, too.

526
00:25:34,002 --> 00:25:35,437
True.

527
00:25:42,954 --> 00:25:45,152
Why does he keep staring at us?

528
00:25:45,193 --> 00:25:48,689
I don't think it's us
he's staring at.

529
00:25:48,734 --> 00:25:50,328
I think it's you.

530
00:25:50,371 --> 00:25:52,136
The Vorta probably consider

531
00:25:52,174 --> 00:25:54,702
the Founders gods just
like the Jem'Hadar do.

532
00:25:54,747 --> 00:25:56,239
I am not a Founder.

533
00:25:56,317 --> 00:25:58,413
Well, you're a changeling.

534
00:25:58,455 --> 00:26:00,084
That's close enough.

535
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:02,955
To them.

536
00:26:02,998 --> 00:26:05,196
I wonder what would happen
if you went over there

537
00:26:05,304 --> 00:26:07,035
and ordered him
to stand on his head.

538
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,035
It's time.

539
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:24,637
It is time when I say
it's time.

540
00:26:32,096 --> 00:26:33,725
Very well.

541
00:26:33,766 --> 00:26:36,431
Prepare six vials.

542
00:26:38,109 --> 00:26:39,373
Unlock.

543
00:26:43,254 --> 00:26:46,989
First Omet'iklan, can you vouch
for the loyalty of your men?

544
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:49,296
We pledge our loyalty
to the Founders

545
00:26:49,334 --> 00:26:52,273
from now until death.

546
00:26:52,306 --> 00:26:54,834
Then receive this reward
from the Founders.

547
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,283
May it keep you strong.

548
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,910
I guess that's one way
to assure loyalty.

549
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:16,187
Loyalty bought at such a price
is no loyalty at all.

550
00:27:16,226 --> 00:27:18,527
Resume your training.

551
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:26,039
Human, come with me.

552
00:27:26,081 --> 00:27:29,077
It is time to resume
our battle drills.

553
00:27:29,122 --> 00:27:31,423
In a minute.

554
00:27:31,459 --> 00:27:32,826
I'm ready now.

555
00:27:32,863 --> 00:27:35,130
Well, I'm not.

556
00:27:35,168 --> 00:27:39,007
They stuff themselves with food

557
00:27:39,042 --> 00:27:41,309
but have no appetite
for battle.

558
00:27:41,348 --> 00:27:44,810
When the time comes, you
will find us more than ready.

559
00:27:44,855 --> 00:27:48,226
Ready to flee
at the first sign of danger.

560
00:27:48,264 --> 00:27:49,459
Let's go.

561
00:27:49,499 --> 00:27:51,834
You can practice running away.

562
00:27:55,445 --> 00:27:59,318
I've always wanted
to kill a Klingon.

563
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:09,131
That's enough!

564
00:28:11,615 --> 00:28:15,920
The next one who throws a punch
will have to answer to me!

565
00:28:15,958 --> 00:28:19,398
Now, I want to know
who started this!

566
00:28:21,002 --> 00:28:22,266
I did.

567
00:28:22,304 --> 00:28:23,933
And I.

568
00:28:23,975 --> 00:28:25,535
You...

569
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:26,911
again.

570
00:28:26,948 --> 00:28:29,009
You knew my orders.

571
00:28:29,052 --> 00:28:31,022
And I defied them.

572
00:28:31,057 --> 00:28:33,358
I deserve punishment.

573
00:28:33,396 --> 00:28:35,924
And you shall have it.

574
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:48,225
Why are you waiting?

575
00:28:48,261 --> 00:28:51,131
Kill him and be done with it.

576
00:28:52,872 --> 00:28:54,637
Mr. Worf...

577
00:28:54,676 --> 00:28:57,706
when not on duty,
you are confined to quarters

578
00:28:57,749 --> 00:28:59,719
for the remainder
of this mission.

579
00:28:59,753 --> 00:29:02,088
Yes, sir.

580
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:04,392
All right, let's break this up.

581
00:29:04,431 --> 00:29:07,836
Get back to your stations
or to your quarters.

582
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,638
Either way, I want
this room cleared.

583
00:29:10,677 --> 00:29:11,976
Now!

584
00:29:17,058 --> 00:29:20,691
You call that discipline?

585
00:29:22,704 --> 00:29:25,643
A dead man can't learn
from his mistakes.

586
00:29:25,677 --> 00:29:29,048
I don't get the same joy
out of killing as you do.

587
00:29:29,084 --> 00:29:31,020
You think I enjoyed it?

588
00:29:31,056 --> 00:29:34,518
Toman'torax was my Second.

589
00:29:35,866 --> 00:29:39,898
He served under me three years.

590
00:29:39,941 --> 00:29:41,433
I valued him.

591
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,107
You have a...

592
00:29:44,151 --> 00:29:46,247
funny way of showing it.

593
00:29:46,289 --> 00:29:48,259
I did what had to be done...

594
00:29:48,293 --> 00:29:49,887
what any First would do.

595
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:54,497
I placed the good of the unit
above my personal feelings.

596
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:58,276
Any soldier
who cannot follow orders

597
00:29:58,315 --> 00:30:01,219
is a danger to his unit...

598
00:30:01,255 --> 00:30:03,351
and must be eliminated.

599
00:30:03,393 --> 00:30:06,958
Mr. Worf is not a danger
to my command.

600
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:11,534
But if I eliminate him for
a simple breach of discipline

601
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:13,113
then I would be.

602
00:30:14,885 --> 00:30:18,518
My men would stop trusting me

603
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,430
and I wouldn't blame them.

604
00:30:21,466 --> 00:30:23,060
You are weak.

605
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,938
You should die in his place.

606
00:30:27,981 --> 00:30:31,011
And when this mission is over

607
00:30:31,054 --> 00:30:33,252
I will see that you do.

608
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:53,298
Odo.

609
00:30:53,336 --> 00:30:56,001
May I speak
with you for a moment?

610
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:01,476
A moment.

611
00:31:03,158 --> 00:31:06,723
You... know
I've been watching you.

612
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:08,998
I've noticed.

613
00:31:09,037 --> 00:31:10,506
I have to admit

614
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:13,274
I find it somewhat
disturbing seeing you

615
00:31:13,313 --> 00:31:15,010
working for these...

616
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,576
Federation people...

617
00:31:16,621 --> 00:31:18,454
letting them order you around.

618
00:31:18,491 --> 00:31:19,983
You are a Founder.

619
00:31:20,028 --> 00:31:22,675
You should be the one
giving the orders to them

620
00:31:22,809 --> 00:31:25,610
to the Jem'Hadar or even me.

621
00:31:25,648 --> 00:31:29,281
So... if I order you
to leave me alone

622
00:31:29,323 --> 00:31:30,792
you will?

623
00:31:30,826 --> 00:31:32,819
Of course.

624
00:31:32,865 --> 00:31:34,528
But before you do

625
00:31:34,568 --> 00:31:36,835
please, hear what I have to say.

626
00:31:40,848 --> 00:31:44,447
Your people want you
to come home, Odo.

627
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:48,055
No matter what differences
you may have with them

628
00:31:48,098 --> 00:31:51,333
no matter what mistakes
you may have made

629
00:31:51,372 --> 00:31:54,037
they still love you.

630
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,708
Well, maybe they do...

631
00:31:57,753 --> 00:32:00,554
but I don't love them.

632
00:32:00,592 --> 00:32:03,759
You're lying,
and you're not very good at it.

633
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:06,498
I, on the other hand,
am an expert at lies...

634
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:09,135
both in telling them
and in spotting them.

635
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,705
So you may as well
admit the truth.

636
00:32:11,749 --> 00:32:15,052
More than anything
in your life...

637
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:17,960
you want to return
to your people.

638
00:32:17,997 --> 00:32:20,230
And I can make that possible.

639
00:32:21,671 --> 00:32:23,402
How?

640
00:32:24,545 --> 00:32:27,176
Let me worry about the "how."

641
00:32:27,284 --> 00:32:29,311
All I need to know is...

642
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:33,689
are you ready to go home?

643
00:32:33,732 --> 00:32:35,201
No.

644
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:41,103
But I am ready to end
this conversation.

645
00:32:45,023 --> 00:32:46,652
Then it's over.

646
00:32:47,996 --> 00:32:50,729
After all, you are a Founder.

647
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:53,263
I live to serve you.

648
00:33:12,316 --> 00:33:13,649
Commander?

649
00:33:14,822 --> 00:33:16,223
For Keiko?

650
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:21,231
It's my 11th good-bye message
since we've been married.

651
00:33:21,336 --> 00:33:23,534
I'm averaging
almost two a year.

652
00:33:23,574 --> 00:33:25,373
Does she know you do this?

653
00:33:25,412 --> 00:33:27,645
What would I say to her?

654
00:33:27,683 --> 00:33:29,243
"You know, honey

655
00:33:29,353 --> 00:33:31,551
"every time I'm about
to go into battle

656
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,825
"I record a message
for you and Molly

657
00:33:33,864 --> 00:33:36,665
telling you how much
I love you, just in case."

658
00:33:36,703 --> 00:33:39,231
She'd probably
think it was sweet.

659
00:33:39,275 --> 00:33:42,680
It'd probably scare
the hell out of her.

660
00:33:42,716 --> 00:33:45,517
To be honest,
it scares the hell out of me.

661
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:48,392
Every time I record
one of these, I think

662
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:49,955
"This is it.

663
00:33:49,999 --> 00:33:52,938
This is the one they're
going to end up hearing."

664
00:33:52,972 --> 00:33:54,669
It'll never happen.

665
00:33:54,709 --> 00:33:56,303
What makes you say that?

666
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:00,047
Because when you've lived
eight lifetimes

667
00:34:00,088 --> 00:34:02,855
you develop certain instincts.

668
00:34:02,894 --> 00:34:07,268
And my instincts tell me
that you, Miles Edward O'Brien

669
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:10,274
are going to live to be 140
and die in bed

670
00:34:10,377 --> 00:34:13,076
surrounded by family
and friends.

671
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:15,247
Do you really believe that?

672
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:17,018
Do you?

673
00:34:18,729 --> 00:34:20,494
I'd like to.

674
00:34:20,533 --> 00:34:22,970
That's all that matters.

675
00:34:24,441 --> 00:34:26,502
Well, just to be
on the safe side

676
00:34:26,546 --> 00:34:29,678
maybe you'd better enter this
in the ship's log anyway.

677
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,521
I'll put it right alongside
my message to my mother.

678
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:34,826
You record these, too?

679
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,697
Doesn't everyone?

680
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,179
Sir.

681
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,954
Well, it looks like
the upgraded reactant injectors

682
00:34:47,993 --> 00:34:49,656
are working better
than we thought.

683
00:34:52,403 --> 00:34:53,462
Captain.

684
00:34:53,505 --> 00:34:54,700
Mr. Worf.

685
00:34:54,741 --> 00:34:56,233
Battle drills ended
ten minutes ago.

686
00:34:56,278 --> 00:34:57,577
You should be in your quarters.

687
00:34:57,614 --> 00:34:58,673
I'm on my way.

688
00:34:58,716 --> 00:35:00,481
It looks like you
got a little lost.

689
00:35:00,521 --> 00:35:02,754
There is something
I wish to discuss with you.

690
00:35:06,534 --> 00:35:08,060
Go on.

691
00:35:08,104 --> 00:35:09,471
It has come to my attention

692
00:35:09,506 --> 00:35:12,239
that First Omet'iklan
has threatened to kill you.

693
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,079
I didn't know that
was public knowledge.

694
00:35:14,117 --> 00:35:16,213
You told Commander Dax.

695
00:35:16,255 --> 00:35:18,453
Well, that explains it.

696
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:19,894
She is concerned about you

697
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,159
and for good reason.

698
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,896
As your Executive Officer

699
00:35:22,936 --> 00:35:24,371
I recommend that you
remain on the ship

700
00:35:24,473 --> 00:35:25,498
during the away mission.

701
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:28,538
That way, Omet'iklan
will have no opportunity

702
00:35:28,582 --> 00:35:30,245
to carry out his threat.

703
00:35:30,286 --> 00:35:33,885
I appreciate the concern,
but do you really think

704
00:35:33,927 --> 00:35:35,396
I'm going to follow
that recommendation?

705
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,922
No, sir, I do not.

706
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:39,803
But I hope you
will take some advice.

707
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,870
Do not turn your back on him.

708
00:35:42,913 --> 00:35:44,849
I won't.

709
00:35:44,885 --> 00:35:46,479
Good.

710
00:35:48,994 --> 00:35:50,759
I also want you to know

711
00:35:50,798 --> 00:35:55,263
if somehow he does carry out
his threat...

712
00:35:55,307 --> 00:35:58,747
he will not live
to boast about it.

713
00:36:02,523 --> 00:36:06,396
That's... very reassuring,
Mr. Worf.

714
00:36:06,432 --> 00:36:08,026
Dax to Sisko.

715
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:09,402
Go ahead.

716
00:36:09,505 --> 00:36:12,033
We're approaching Vandros IV.
Captain.

717
00:36:12,077 --> 00:36:13,512
On my way.

718
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:35,888
I'm waiting.

719
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,343
Don't worry.
These aren't like the ones

720
00:36:47,389 --> 00:36:49,052
we gave you during the drill.

721
00:36:49,092 --> 00:36:50,527
They're fully charged.

722
00:36:51,531 --> 00:36:53,832
The weapon's set on "stun."

723
00:36:55,674 --> 00:36:56,664
Deactivate safeties.

724
00:36:56,709 --> 00:36:58,976
Reset weapons...

725
00:36:59,014 --> 00:37:00,608
to maximum power.

726
00:37:05,394 --> 00:37:08,195
Well, this is
a momentous occasion...

727
00:37:08,235 --> 00:37:12,108
the first joint operation
between the Federation

728
00:37:12,142 --> 00:37:13,371
and the Dominion.

729
00:37:13,412 --> 00:37:16,248
I can't wait to see
how it turns out.

730
00:37:16,285 --> 00:37:17,811
Prepare to transport.

731
00:37:17,855 --> 00:37:19,154
Wait.

732
00:37:19,192 --> 00:37:22,393
I am First Omet'iklan.

733
00:37:22,432 --> 00:37:24,699
And I am dead.

734
00:37:24,737 --> 00:37:26,935
As of this moment

735
00:37:26,975 --> 00:37:29,208
we are all dead.

736
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,274
We go into battle...

737
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:34,291
to reclaim our lives.

738
00:37:34,325 --> 00:37:35,919
This we do gladly

739
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,727
for we are Jem'Hadar.

740
00:37:37,766 --> 00:37:39,065
Remember...

741
00:37:39,102 --> 00:37:42,269
victory is life.

742
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,941
Victory is life.

743
00:37:53,634 --> 00:37:56,231
Such a delightful people.

744
00:37:56,273 --> 00:37:58,574
I am Chief Miles Edward O'Brien.

745
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:00,081
I'm very much alive

746
00:38:00,115 --> 00:38:02,085
and I intend to stay that way.

747
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:03,280
Amen.

748
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,258
Let's get it done.

749
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,867
You betrayed us.

750
00:38:27,909 --> 00:38:29,104
What are you talking about?

751
00:38:29,146 --> 00:38:30,809
Our rifles are sabotaged.

752
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:31,976
Hold on.

753
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:34,319
Mine's dead, too.

754
00:38:34,357 --> 00:38:36,453
Something must be interfering
with our equipment.

755
00:38:36,494 --> 00:38:37,587
The gateway.

756
00:38:37,698 --> 00:38:40,226
It's probably generating
some kind of dampening field.

757
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,001
If that's the case,
we'd better come up

758
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,030
with a new plan.

759
00:39:04,323 --> 00:39:06,794
We lost Ramirez, too.

760
00:39:06,828 --> 00:39:09,061
It would appear
we no longer have

761
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,535
the element of surprise.

762
00:39:10,569 --> 00:39:13,132
I suppose you want
to call off the mission.

763
00:39:15,113 --> 00:39:16,103
Guess again.

764
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,825
Worf.

765
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:57,936
This way.

766
00:39:59,877 --> 00:40:01,710
Go ahead.
We'll hold them off.

767
00:40:09,299 --> 00:40:10,563
Keep moving.

768
00:40:12,506 --> 00:40:15,171
Virak'kara,
are you still there?!

769
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:18,379
For a little while longer.

770
00:40:18,419 --> 00:40:19,512
Don't worry!

771
00:40:19,554 --> 00:40:21,023
You'll make honored...

772
00:40:21,058 --> 00:40:22,721
elder... yet.

773
00:40:28,341 --> 00:40:29,640
Down that way!

774
00:40:29,676 --> 00:40:32,808
Look down that hall.
Over there.

775
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,481
I think we have waited
long enough.

776
00:40:52,326 --> 00:40:53,419
You're sure the explosives

777
00:40:53,462 --> 00:40:54,931
won't be affected
by the gateway?

778
00:40:54,965 --> 00:40:56,491
The primary detonator
might not work

779
00:40:56,535 --> 00:40:58,471
but the chemical backup
should do the trick.

780
00:40:58,507 --> 00:40:59,908
The way is clear.

781
00:40:59,942 --> 00:41:02,038
Let's move.

782
00:41:33,383 --> 00:41:35,513
I threatened to kill you

783
00:41:35,554 --> 00:41:38,493
but you were willing
to sacrifice yourself

784
00:41:38,528 --> 00:41:40,157
to save my life.

785
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:41,497
Looks that way.

786
00:41:41,534 --> 00:41:42,798
Why?

787
00:41:42,837 --> 00:41:45,638
If you have to ask,
you'll never understand.

788
00:41:45,676 --> 00:41:48,911
Gentlemen, I think it's time
we were leaving.

789
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:54,192
Let's go.

790
00:41:55,632 --> 00:41:58,867
If I were you,
I'd run like hell.

791
00:42:02,648 --> 00:42:04,515
What about Dax and the others?

792
00:42:04,552 --> 00:42:05,919
Here, Captain.

793
00:42:11,567 --> 00:42:13,036
So much for the gateway.

794
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,869
Our weapons are working again.

795
00:42:22,524 --> 00:42:25,291
The <i>Defiant's</i> sensors
registered a powerful explosion

796
00:42:25,331 --> 00:42:26,698
in the vicinity of the gateway.

797
00:42:26,733 --> 00:42:28,259
I trust your mission
was a success?

798
00:42:28,303 --> 00:42:30,536
The gateway's been destroyed,
if that's what you mean.

799
00:42:33,983 --> 00:42:35,680
Well done, Captain.

800
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,781
You've all done quite nicely.

801
00:42:37,825 --> 00:42:39,158
Now, if you don't mind

802
00:42:39,194 --> 00:42:41,791
I'd like to inspect
the wreckage.

803
00:42:45,808 --> 00:42:48,143
That was for questioning...

804
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,945
our loyalty.

805
00:42:51,655 --> 00:42:53,318
I think

806
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:56,091
there's been enough
killing for one day.

807
00:42:58,604 --> 00:43:02,511
The Vorta will have
no further use of this.

808
00:43:02,545 --> 00:43:04,846
My men and I will remain here.

809
00:43:04,951 --> 00:43:10,020
There are still disloyal
Jem'Hadar on this planet.

810
00:43:10,062 --> 00:43:13,867
They must be hunted down
and eliminated.

811
00:43:13,937 --> 00:43:16,340
Good luck.

812
00:43:16,376 --> 00:43:18,005
You fought well.

813
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:21,911
But the next time we meet...

814
00:43:23,659 --> 00:43:26,028
we'll be enemies.

815
00:43:26,064 --> 00:43:29,094
I'll keep that in mind.

816
00:43:37,622 --> 00:43:39,114
I don't know about
the rest of you

817
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:40,628
but I'd like to get out of here.

818
00:43:41,899 --> 00:43:44,063
Sisko to <i>Defiant.</i>

819
00:43:44,103 --> 00:43:45,970
Begin transport.
