00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:06,340
SISKO:<i> Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 49904.2.</i>

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,676
<i>After driving away</i>
<i>Breen privateers</i>

3
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:10,928
<i>from the Bajoran colony</i>
<i>of Free Haven,</i>

4
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:13,221
<i>we are returning</i>
<i>to Deep Space 9.</i>

5
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,560
When I was Lela Dax,
I went through the same thing.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,771
Every night, I'd
tuck in my son Ahjess

7
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:23,357
and two hours later, he'd
crawl into bed with me.

8
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,151
I don't think I slept
through a night for weeks.

9
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:29,655
Weeks? Molly's been doing this
for two months already.

10
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:32,700
She just needs
a little attention.

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,868
Dax is right.

12
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:35,995
I'd say she's jealous.

13
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:37,872
She knows that you and Keiko
are going to have a baby soon.

14
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:39,581
What makes you
such an expert on children?

15
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:42,001
First in my class
in pediatric medicine.

16
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,252
I wouldn't sit there
if I were you.

17
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,421
Why? Miles spill
something again?

18
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,507
It's Worf's seat.
He'll be here in a minute.

19
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:51,426
Just because Worf
lives on the<i> Defiant</i> full-time

20
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,595
doesn't give him proprietary
rights in the Mess Hall.

21
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,430
No one says it does.

22
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,182
He just likes that seat.

23
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:07,401
Prune juice,
extra large.

24
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,048
Have a seat, Commander.

25
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,301
Thank you.

26
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:38,640
SISKO:
All senior staff, report
to the Bridge immediately.

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,727
(<i> alarm blares</i> )

28
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,439
You'd better have
a look at this.

29
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:59,327
(<i> people yelling commands</i>
<i>and responses</i> )

30
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,122
KIRA:
Concentrate on the fires
in Section 13.

31
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,124
We have to keep them away
from the plasma conduits.

32
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,961
Has anyone seen
my brother Rom?!

33
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,629
He told me he was
going to be working

34
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,006
in one of the upper
pylons today.
He's fine.

35
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,675
I saw him with one
of the damage-control teams
on Level 5.

36
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,302
Ah, what a relief.

37
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,972
Wait till I find him--
I'll kill him!

38
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,807
For scaring me
like this.

39
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,225
Major, here's a
preliminary list
of the stolen equipment.

40
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,685
SISKO:
Report, Major.

41
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,395
It was a Jem'Hadar
strike team.

42
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,272
They beamed aboard
from a civilian transport,

43
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,816
disabled communications
and weapons,

44
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:31,110
set off an explosive device
in Upper Pylon 3.

45
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,694
Fought a number
of small...

46
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,489
This one's gone.

47
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,157
Spinal fracture,

48
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,909
and severe trauma
to the cranial meninges.

49
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,369
They raided the Science Lab,
the reactor-control facility

50
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,038
and several cargo bays.

51
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,833
"Microfusion initiators,
photonic amplifiers,

52
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,251
EPS power
stabilizers."

53
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,420
They were out of here
and through the wormhole
before we knew what hit us.

54
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,756
BASHIR:
Constable, how many casualties
do we have?

55
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,758
So far, 18 confirmed dead,
31 missing,

56
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,010
and over a hundred wounded.

57
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,886
How long ago did
the Jem'Hadar leave?

58
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,305
Uh... 45 minutes
at the most.

59
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,141
That means their ion trail
hasn't decayed yet.

60
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:03,600
We could still follow them.

61
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,184
I intend to do
more than that.

62
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:07,437
Sisko to<i> Defiant.</i> 
Prepare for departure.

63
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,065
I'm going to stay here,
take care of the wounded.
That includes you.

64
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:12,776
The station's yours, Major.
Contact Starfleet.

65
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,361
Tell them to get
some ships out here

66
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,946
just in case
this is a diversion.

67
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,405
Understood.

68
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:20,159
Constable, you're with us.

69
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,703
Sisko to<i> Defiant.</i>

70
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,538
Three to beam out.

71
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,230
What do you see, Dax?

72
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,108
Nothing good.
Their ion trail
is getting fainter.

73
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:01,402
The Jem'Hadar must be
emitting a magneton pulse
to cover their tracks.

74
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,530
Keep on them.
I want that ship.

75
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,200
Frankly, I'm surprised
something like this
hasn't happened sooner.

76
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,701
Being at the edge
of the wormhole

77
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,661
makes Deep Space 9
a tempting target.

78
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,746
Sometimes, I wish we
could have the<i> Defiant</i>

79
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,415
standing guard over the
station<i> 26</i> hours a day.

80
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,543
Restricting the<i> Defiant</i>
to guard duty

81
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:17,878
would be
a serious mistake.

82
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,296
You wouldn't say that

83
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,048
if you had family
living in the station.

84
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,466
Perhaps, but adopting
a siege mentality

85
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,384
is ultimately
self-defeating.

86
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:27,428
I've got something.

87
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,388
Bearing 057 mark 009.

88
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:32,309
Red Alert.
On screen.

89
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,811
(<i> alarm blares</i> )

90
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,439
WORF:
A Jem'Hadar warship.

91
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,650
This cannot be the vessel
we are looking for.

92
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,945
Major Kira said
the Jem'Hadar strike team

93
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,906
that attacked the station
used a transport ship.

94
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,783
Captain, that warship's
in pretty bad shape.

95
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,911
Looks like someone's been using
it for target practice.

96
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,330
They're transmitting
a broad-band distress signal.

97
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,749
It could be a trap.
How many crew
members aboard?

98
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,458
I'm reading
seven life signs.

99
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,211
You won't be reading them
for long.

100
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:02,005
Their reactor's
about to go critical.

101
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,718
Chief, have a security detail
report to the transporter bay.

102
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,762
Odo, Commander Worf,
you're with me.

103
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,479
Transporter
protocol five.

104
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,236
Sisko to Bridge.
Drop cloak.

105
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:25,570
Engage.

106
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,993
SISKO:
Reinstate cloak.

107
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,662
If you're looking
for your weapons...

108
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,581
they were removed in transport.

109
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,709
Even without weapons...

110
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,003
we're more than
a match for you.

111
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,839
I would not be
so certain of that.

112
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,633
A Klingon.

113
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,302
And the traitor.

114
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,761
The Founders
will be pleased.

115
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,346
MALE:
Omet'iklan.

116
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,143
Control your men.

117
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,519
These people
saved our lives.

118
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,980
OMET'IKLAN:
And for that,

119
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,648
we shall take advantage
of their mistake.

120
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,025
You'll do<i> nothing</i>
without my approval.

121
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,027
My apologies, Captain.

122
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,904
I'm afraid the Jem'Hadar
are sadly deficient

123
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,364
in the social graces.

124
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,616
Two hours ago,
my station was attacked

125
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,118
by a Jem'Hadar strike team.

126
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,078
I know-- they
attacked us, too.

127
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,414
Why would your own people
attack you?

128
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,832
Tell them nothing.

129
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,625
This is not
their concern.

130
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,378
Your next allowance
of white will be in
two hours.

131
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,255
If you want it on time

132
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,299
you will be quiet
and do as you're told.

133
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,801
Captain...

134
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,513
you and I should talk...

135
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,059
in private?

136
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,647
If you have something
to say to me, make it quick.

137
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,525
Captain Benjamin Sisko.

138
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,028
I feel honored.

139
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:51,114
Your psychographic profile
is required reading

140
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,949
for Vorta Field Supervisors.

141
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,286
I probably know things about you
you don't know yourself.

142
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,578
If you're trying
to impress me,

143
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,373
you can forget it.

144
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,626
What would you say...

145
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,546
if I offered to make you

146
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,133
absolute ruler
of the Federation?

147
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:13,220
No President,
no Starfleet
Chief of Staff--

148
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,971
just you.

149
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,807
I'd say your psychographic
profile of me

150
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,851
isn't as good as you think.

151
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:22,312
(<i> chuckling</i> )

152
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,314
Just...

153
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,024
doing my job--

154
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,651
trying to build a bridge

155
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:32,155
between the Dominion
and a potential ally.

156
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,740
After all,
wouldn't it be much simpler

157
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,950
if the Dominion
and the Federation

158
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,912
could reach some mutual
beneficial understanding

159
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,997
without resorting
to the unpleasantness

160
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,290
of military conflict?

161
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,917
I want to know how to find

162
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,586
the Jem'Hadar
who attacked my station.

163
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,964
If you want to build a bridge,
why don't you start there?

164
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,301
I can lead you to them.

165
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:56,430
But... there's something
I need in exchange.

166
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,764
What's that?

167
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,640
I want you to help
me eliminate them.

168
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,936
The Jem'Hadar that
attacked your station
are renegades.

169
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,521
They've turned their back

170
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,189
on their oath of allegiance
to the Dominion

171
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,024
and it's my job to see
to it they're punished.

172
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,817
Why do you need my help?

173
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,903
You could send a fleet of
Jem'Hadar warships after them.

174
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,114
I'm afraid
we don't have the time.

175
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,284
Captain...

176
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,787
are you familiar
with the Iconians?

177
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:24,040
They controlled a vast
interstellar empire

178
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,833
about 200,000 years ago.

179
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,587
What's important
is<i> how</i> the Iconians

180
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:29,879
controlled that empire.

181
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,047
The gateways.

182
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,008
Exactly.

183
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,510
Sophisticated transporters

184
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,845
that allowed them
to move instantaneously

185
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,848
from one planet to another,
from one<i> solar system</i> to another

186
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,809
without the use of starships.

187
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:46,229
What does any of this
have to do with me?
Dominion scientists

188
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:49,983
recently discovered a gateway
on one of our outlying worlds.

189
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,319
We sent a team of scientists
to restore it,

190
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,029
but their Jem'Hadar guards
rebelled

191
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,575
and are now trying to complete
the gateway themselves.

192
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,744
These...<i> renegade</i> Jem'Hadar

193
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,622
stole some equipment
from my station--

194
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:06,291
EPS power stabilizers,

195
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,251
microfusion initiators,

196
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,920
photonic amplifiers.

197
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,214
I would say it's very possible
they're going

198
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,842
to use that equipment to help
them complete the gateway.

199
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,344
You...

200
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,847
understand
the nature of our dilemma.

201
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,227
If the Jem'Hadar are able
to make the gateway operational,

202
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:29,230
they'll become
virtually invincible.

203
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,524
Our experts predict

204
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,526
the renegades would gather
support

205
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:35,028
from other Jem'Hadar units,
launch a general insurrection

206
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,656
and effect a complete takeover
of the Dominion

207
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,115
in less than a year.

208
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,744
None of which
is my problem.

209
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,330
That's very short-sighted
of you, Captain.

210
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,748
Think about it.

211
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,502
If the Jem'Hadar seize
control of the Dominion,

212
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,003
there'll be
no stopping them.

213
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,588
Even shutting down
the wormhole

214
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,298
won't protect
the Alpha Quadrant.

215
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,133
With the gateway

216
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,469
they could put a million
Jem'Hadar warriors

217
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,929
on any Federation planet
instantaneously.

218
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,600
Would you care to see
our projections

219
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,185
of Federation casualties?

220
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,855
Couldn't the Founders

221
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,773
just order them
to surrender?

222
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,651
From what I know,
the Jem'Hadar have been

223
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,445
genetically engineered
to obey them.

224
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:23,284
The Founders' ability
to control the Jem'Hadar

225
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,203
has been somewhat...

226
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:31,042
overstated.

227
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:35,046
Otherwise, we never would have
had to addict them to the white.

228
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,632
Sounds like the Dominion
isn't quite as stable

229
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,758
as you'd like us to believe.

230
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:44,681
The Dominion has endured
for 2,000 years,

231
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,474
and will continue to endure

232
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,687
long after the Federation
has crumbled into dust.

233
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,022
But we'll leave
that to history.

234
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,734
Right now, we have
a more pressing concern.

235
00:12:57,611 --> 00:13:02,240
The gateway must be destroyed.

236
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,033
Agreed?

237
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,042
Agreed.

238
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,758
So let me get this straight.

239
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:22,093
We're going to work
<i>with</i> the Jem'Hadar
to fight the Jem'Hadar.

240
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,802
I don't relish
this idea either,

241
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,513
but we don't have
much of a choice.

242
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,889
I was on the mission

243
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,933
that discovered
the Iconian homeworld.

244
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,018
We were forced to destroy
the gateway we found there

245
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,979
rather than let it fall
into the hands of the Romulans

246
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,774
and Starfleet Command
supported our decision.

247
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:38,401
If they didn't want the Romulans
to get a hold of it

248
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,111
I'm sure they don't want the
Jem'Hadar to have it either.

249
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,696
What are we supposed to do?

250
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,615
Give Omet'iklan and his men
their weapons back

251
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,408
and then hope
they don't point them at us?

252
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,201
They're not
going to get

253
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,412
their hands on any weapons
until we reach our target.

254
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:52,290
How do we know that these
Jem'Hadar can be trusted?

255
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,292
They must realize
that controlling the gateway

256
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,960
would mean freedom
for their people.

257
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,378
According to Weyoun,

258
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,879
they don't know anything
about the gateway.

259
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,590
They think that this

260
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,300
is just a routine
search-and-destroy mission--

261
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,385
find the renegade Jem'Hadar,
eliminate them

262
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,886
and their base.

263
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:09,307
You are asking us to lie
to them about our mission.

264
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,975
It is not honorable.

265
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,519
O'BRIEN:
There's a lot of things

266
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,395
about this mission
that bother me.

267
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,356
But lying to the Jem'Hadar
is not on top of my list.

268
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,233
If the Jem'Hadar find out
that we've deceived them...

269
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,943
They're not going
to find out anything.

270
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,945
Well, they won't hear it
from me.

271
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,865
There'll be a joint
briefing session at 1900 hours.

272
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,619
Followed by a get-to-know-you
buffet at 1930.

273
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,621
And<i> I</i> forgot my dress uniform.

274
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:38,628
(<i> door chimes</i> )

275
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,714
Enter.

276
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,845
You requested my presence.

277
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:49,263
It seems we're going
to be working together.

278
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,849
So I'm told.

279
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,266
Luckily for you,

280
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,520
the only thing I despise
more than the Federation

281
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,313
is a Jem'Hadar soldier

282
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,816
who breaks his vow
of allegiance.

283
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,068
I'm glad you see it that way.

284
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:05,655
Now-- I have a few things
I want to make clear.

285
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,491
First, this is my ship
and my command,

286
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:12,746
which means I give the orders,
not you and not Weyoun.

287
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,122
What's more, I'm holding you
personally responsible

288
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,833
for the actions of your men.

289
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,418
If I have a problem with them,

290
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,546
you're the one who's going
to have to answer for it.

291
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,131
That's as it should be.

292
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,884
After all--

293
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:27,343
I'm the First.

294
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,220
As far as I'm concerned,

295
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,265
on<i> this</i> mission,<i> I'm</i> the First.

296
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,685
Until the traitors are found
and terminated.

297
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:37,978
After that...

298
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,566
we shall see.

299
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,529
Am I dismissed?

300
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,616
For the time being.

301
00:15:57,248 --> 00:16:00,042
SISKO:
According to Dominion
Intelligence, the Jem'Hadar

302
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,711
have established
a base camp here.

303
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,254
The interior of the structure

304
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,423
is riddled with a
network of corridors

305
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,174
and interlocking chambers.

306
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:11,763
Our primary objective
is to destroy the Jem'Hadar arms

307
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:14,682
and supply cache
in<i> this</i> chamber.

308
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,644
The trick...
will be getting there.

309
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,854
We can't beam directly
into the structure,

310
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,273
which means we'll have
to fight our way in.

311
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,733
Jem'Hadar tactics
dictate

312
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:24,818
at least 27 soldiers

313
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,611
are stationed
inside the base camp

314
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:27,737
at all times.

315
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,572
Nine will patrol
the perimeter.

316
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:33,033
And additional troops are
deployed throughout the city.

317
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,328
How many renegades are there
altogether?

318
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,122
162 in the original garrison.

319
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:42,585
We killed at least 12
during the initial rebellion.

320
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,254
Well, that still
leaves 150.

321
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,007
Just between you and me,
Captain, I think we're
a little outnumbered.

322
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,177
Wouldn't it be simpler
to take out the
base from orbit?

323
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,514
A couple of quantum torpedoes
should be enough to
level the entire area.

324
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,766
Unfortunately,
that's not an option.

325
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,644
The central structure
is composed of
solid neutronium.

326
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,729
Even a direct hit
from a quantum torpedo

327
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,857
wouldn't necessarily
destroy our objective.

328
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:07,026
Which means we have
to go in ourselves.

329
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,569
JEM'HADAR:
As it should be.

330
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,988
It is our duty to punish

331
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:13,282
those who would break
their vow of loyalty.

332
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,327
Are you accusing me
of something?

333
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,538
OMET'IKLAN:
It is not for us
to accuse a god

334
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,623
of betraying heaven.

335
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,792
The gods themselves...

336
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,085
will sit in judgment over you.

337
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,713
I'm no god,

338
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,631
and neither
are the Founders.

339
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,885
The sooner you realize that,
the better off you'll be.

340
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:39,225
We've chosen
a beam-in site here

341
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,643
in this wooded area.

342
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,186
That'll give us a chance

343
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:45,023
to evaluate the situation
before proceeding.

344
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,191
Our first objective will be

345
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,945
to secure the main entrance
to the ziggurat.

346
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:53,740
Neutralizing nine guards
before one of them

347
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,867
can raise an alarm
will be difficult.

348
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,785
It's as you said.

349
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,621
The Klingon will to fight

350
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,248
pales in comparison
to our own.

351
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,374
Yes.

352
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,793
He has the look
of a warrior,

353
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,587
but the heart
of a coward.

354
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,839
If you would like to
test my courage, I--

355
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,549
All right, that's enough.

356
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,801
One day,
the Klingon Empire

357
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,303
will fall before the Jem'Hadar,

358
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,264
and when that day comes,

359
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:22,435
and piles of Klingons
lie dead at my feet,

360
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,229
I will think of you,
standing here,

361
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:28,274
impotent and weak,
and I will laugh.

362
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,651
All right! I said that's enough!
Worf, let him go!

363
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,236
Second!
Release the Klingon,

364
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,864
or I will kill you
where you stand.

365
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:41,454
Now, the two of you,
as you were.

366
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,040
I promise, you'll<i> both</i>

367
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,875
have more fight
than you can handle

368
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,001
before this is over.

369
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,728
(<i> grunts</i> )

370
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,565
Let's go.

371
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,944
I'm right with you.

372
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,330
Worf!

373
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,541
Go.

374
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:35,633
Ready.

375
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,259
Wait.
The room's not secure.

376
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,678
We have to find the third guard.

377
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:39,971
I do not see him.

378
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:41,388
He's here somewhere.

379
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,849
I know.

380
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:46,102
We're supposed to be
on our way out
by now.

381
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,063
Where is he?

382
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,483
We're running
out of time, Commander.

383
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:53,776
The third
Jem'Hadar guard--

384
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,695
he is still
here somewhere.

385
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,822
Look for a slight
rippling effect.

386
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,157
We know what
we're looking for.

387
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:00,282
We just can't find it.

388
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,660
We're dead.

389
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,829
OMET'IKLAN:
That's correct.

390
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:07,247
WEYOUN:
The Jem'Hadar defense grid
is now in operation.

391
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,375
Automated weapon systems
have killed everyone

392
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,044
in this room.

393
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,004
Your crew failed
in their mission.

394
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,797
Well, you might as well tell us,
where's the other one?

395
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,299
There was
no third guard.
I don't understand.

396
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,926
You told me
that Jem'Hadar soldiers

397
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,219
always operate
in teams of three.

398
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,971
In battle,
nothing is certain.

399
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,806
You should have
armed the explosives

400
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,850
as soon as you
were in position.

401
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,143
We had to be sure
the room was secured.

402
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,769
Otherwise, someone
could have

403
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,396
disarmed the explosives
the moment we left.

404
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,439
OMET'IKLAN:
If you couldn't secure the room

405
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,316
you should not plan
on leaving it.

406
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,277
You want us to blow the place up
while we're still in it?

407
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,654
This is a waste of time.

408
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,322
They'll never succeed

409
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,576
as long as they value
their lives more than victory.

410
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,369
There's something
to be said for soldiers

411
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,495
who aren't afraid to die.

412
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,955
Oh, I don't know.

413
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,373
I've found that
nothing keeps me alert

414
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,084
quite like a healthy
fear of death.

415
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,292
Keep practicing.

416
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,878
The two of
you, with me.

417
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,136
One of the reasons
for these drills

418
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,097
is to help our crews
learn to work together.

419
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:05,848
Constantly showing
contempt for my people

420
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,600
isn't making
it any easier.

421
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,601
Would you prefer I lied?

422
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,228
What I'd like

423
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:12,772
is for you to at least
maintain the pretense

424
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,565
that we're on the same side.

425
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:19,112
Captain, I understand
your concerns,

426
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,571
and so does Omet'iklan.

427
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:23,074
Deck Five, Section One.

428
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:24,617
The only way
my troops

429
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:25,993
can come to
respect your crew

430
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,996
is to fight alongside them--

431
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,248
mixed teams

432
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:31,874
in every aspect
of the mission.

433
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,375
That's not practical.

434
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,710
Why not?

435
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,463
Are you questioning my decision?

436
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,215
You fool.

437
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:43,010
My men and I,
we know all about the gateway.

438
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,015
Halt turbolift.

439
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,517
Looks like your secret's out.

440
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,770
How do you know
about the gateway?

441
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,730
It doesn't matter
how we know.

442
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,066
The point is, we know.

443
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:59,443
You think you have to lie to us

444
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:02,196
and use the white
to ensure our loyalty.

445
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:04,448
But the fact is, we are
more loyal to the Founders

446
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,408
than the Vorta
ever will be.

447
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,869
It is the<i> reason</i>
for our existence.

448
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,290
It is the core...

449
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,374
of our being.

450
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:17,086
There's an entire company
of Jem'Hadar

451
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:20,089
down on Vandros IV
who would disagree with you.

452
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,133
And for that, they will die.

453
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,387
Mixed teams, it is.

454
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,723
But let's get
one thing straight.

455
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,143
This isn't going to be
a suicide mission.

456
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:33,936
As far as I'm concerned,

457
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:36,105
everyone who goes in,
comes back out--

458
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,982
Starfleet and Jem'Hadar alike.

459
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:40,693
Your concern for life
is touching.

460
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:44,322
Let's hope it doesn't stop us
from achieving...

461
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:46,615
our objectives.

462
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:51,787
Computer, reactivate turbolift.

463
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,010
Am I really
that interesting?

464
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,888
You've been standing
there staring at me

465
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,597
for the last two hours.

466
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,808
You are part of
my combat team.

467
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,644
I must learn to understand
your behavior,

468
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,563
anticipate
your actions.

469
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:20,691
There must be something
you'd rather do.

470
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,484
Maybe get some sleep?

471
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,695
We don't sleep.

472
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,615
How about getting
something to eat?

473
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:31,869
The white is
the only thing we need.

474
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:35,039
You don't sleep,
you don't eat.

475
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,377
What do you do for relaxation?

476
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:42,922
Relaxation
would only make us weak.

477
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,924
Well, you people
are no fun at all.

478
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,717
I'm glad I'm not
a Jem'Hadar woman.

479
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:49,511
There are no Jem'Hadar women.

480
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:53,057
So what do you do?
Lay eggs?

481
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:56,518
Jem'Hadar are bred
in birthing chambers.

482
00:23:56,518 --> 00:24:01,190
We are able to fight within
three days of our emergence.

483
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,816
Lucky you.

484
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,819
So let me get this straight.

485
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:09,447
No sleep, no food...

486
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:10,950
no women.

487
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,287
No wonder you're so angry.

488
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:18,040
After 30 or 40 years of that,
I'd be angry, too.

489
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,543
No Jem'Hadar
has ever lived 30 years.

490
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,963
How old are you?

491
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,006
I am eight.

492
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:30,010
I would have guessed
at least 15.

493
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,264
Hmm. Few Jem'Hadar
live that long.

494
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,349
If we reach 20,

495
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:38,560
we are considered
honored elders.

496
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:45,025
How old are you?

497
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:50,406
I stopped counting at 300.

498
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:54,910
You don't look it.

499
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,787
Thank you.

500
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,582
No women?
I'm not surprised.

501
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:04,170
Personally,
I envy them.

502
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,713
I mean, their ability
to go without sleep.

503
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,548
I'm sure I could
be more productive

504
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,968
if I didn't have to
regenerate every day.

505
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,137
What is the point
of doing battle

506
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:15,222
if you cannot enjoy
the fruits of your victory?

507
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,849
You mean sleep?

508
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:20,436
No, I mean spending long nights
singing songs of your deeds.

509
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,480
Good food, good drink.

510
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,897
And good women.

511
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,150
Now, we consider Klingon women

512
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,776
our partners in battle.

513
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,321
They are the mothers
of our children.

514
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,239
And a lot of fun
at parties, too.

515
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,782
True.

516
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,826
(<i> chuckling</i> )

517
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,459
Why does he keep staring at us?

518
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:47,046
I don't think it's<i> us</i>
he's staring at.

519
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,714
I think it's you.

520
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,508
DAX:
The Vorta
probably consider

521
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:53,093
the Founders gods just
like the Jem'Hadar do.

522
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,678
I am not a Founder.

523
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,722
Well, you're
a changeling.

524
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,349
That's close enough.

525
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,477
To<i> them.</i>

526
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,854
I wonder what would happen
if you went over there

527
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,356
and ordered him
to stand on his head.

528
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:07,107
(<i> laughing</i> )

529
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,452
It's time.

530
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:21,455
It is time
when I say

531
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:22,831
it's time.

532
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,297
(<i> groans</i> )

533
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,132
Very well.

534
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,801
Prepare six vials.

535
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,721
Unlock.

536
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,601
First Omet'iklan,
can you vouch

537
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:45,396
for the loyalty
of your men?

538
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:47,565
We pledge our loyalty
to the Founders

539
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:50,776
from now until death.

540
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,237
Then receive this reward
from the Founders.

541
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,573
May it keep you strong.

542
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:10,296
I guess that's one way
to assure loyalty.

543
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:14,467
Loyalty bought at such a price
is no loyalty at all.

544
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,927
Resume your training.

545
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:24,518
Human, come with me.

546
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:27,146
It is time to resume
our battle drills.

547
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:29,398
In a minute.

548
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,400
I'm ready now.

549
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,901
Well, I'm not.

550
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:37,156
They stuff themselves
with food

551
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,533
but have no appetite
for battle.

552
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:42,328
When the time comes, you
will find us more than ready.

553
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:45,539
Ready to flee
at the first sign of danger.

554
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:47,749
Let's go.

555
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:50,002
You can practice
running away.

556
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:57,593
I've always wanted
to kill a Klingon.

557
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:07,436
That's enough!

558
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,399
The next one
who throws a punch

559
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,360
will have to answer to me!

560
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,737
Now, I want to know
who started this!

561
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,533
I did.

562
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:22,159
And I.

563
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,910
You...

564
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,371
again.

565
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:27,498
You knew my orders.

566
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:29,500
And I defied them.

567
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,627
I deserve punishment.

568
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:34,129
And you shall have it.

569
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,642
Why are you waiting?

570
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:49,353
Kill him
and be done with it.

571
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,148
Mr. Worf...

572
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:56,026
when not on duty,
you are confined to quarters

573
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:58,028
for the remainder
of this mission.

574
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,447
Yes, sir.

575
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,949
All right, let's
break this up.

576
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:06,245
Get back to your stations
or to your quarters.

577
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,039
Either way, I want
this room cleared.

578
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,207
<i>Now!</i>

579
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:19,091
You call that discipline?

580
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:24,179
A dead man can't learn
from his mistakes.

581
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,474
I don't get the same joy
out of killing as you do.

582
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,393
You think I enjoyed it?

583
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:32,854
Toman'torax was my Second.

584
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:37,109
He served under me three years.

585
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,737
I valued him.

586
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,573
You have a...

587
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:44,700
funny way of showing it.

588
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,285
I did what had to be done--

589
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,827
what any First
would do.

590
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,913
I placed the good
of the unit

591
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,625
above my personal feelings.

592
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:56,378
Any soldier
who cannot follow orders

593
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:59,339
is a danger to his unit...

594
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,425
and must be eliminated.

595
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:05,137
Mr. Worf is not a danger
to my command.

596
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:09,558
But if I eliminate him for
a simple breach of discipline,

597
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:10,934
then<i> I</i> would be.

598
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,607
My men would stop trusting me,

599
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:19,276
and I wouldn't blame them.

600
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:20,860
You are weak.

601
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:25,907
You should die in his place.

602
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:29,035
And when this
mission is over,

603
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,079
I will see that you do.

604
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,307
Odo.

605
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,810
May I speak with
you for a moment?

606
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,398
A moment.

607
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:03,737
You... know I've
been watching you.

608
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:06,114
I've noticed.

609
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,616
I have to admit,

610
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:10,452
I find it somewhat
disturbing seeing you

611
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:12,078
working for these...

612
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,706
<i>Federation</i> people...

613
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:15,374
letting them
order you around.

614
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,209
You are a Founder.

615
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:20,212
<i>You</i> should be the one
giving the orders to them,

616
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:23,215
to the Jem'Hadar
or even me.

617
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:26,844
So... if I order you
to leave me alone,

618
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:28,220
you will?

619
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,472
Of course.

620
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,015
But before you do,

621
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,267
please, hear
what I have to say.

622
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:41,983
Your people want you
to come home, Odo.

623
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,777
No matter
what differences

624
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:45,696
you may have
with them,

625
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:48,824
no matter what mistakes
you may have made,

626
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,493
they still love you.

627
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:55,247
Well, maybe they do...

628
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:58,208
but<i> I</i> don't love<i> them.</i>

629
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:01,336
You're lying,
and you're not very good at it.

630
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,005
I, on the other hand,
am an expert at lies--

631
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,842
both in telling them
and in spotting them.

632
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,302
So you may as well
admit the truth.

633
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:12,723
More than anything
in your life...

634
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:15,642
you want to return
to your people.

635
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,770
And I can make that possible.

636
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,980
How?

637
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:24,777
Let me worry about the "how."

638
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:26,862
All I need to know is...

639
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:31,283
are you ready to go home?

640
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,701
No.

641
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:38,582
But I<i> am</i> ready to end
this conversation.

642
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,003
Then it's over.

643
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:48,300
After all, you are a Founder.

644
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,761
I live to serve you.

645
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:11,030
Commander?

646
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,742
For Keiko?

647
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:18,914
It's my 11th good-bye message
since we've been married.

648
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:21,124
I'm averaging
almost two a year.

649
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,918
Does she know you do this?

650
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:25,253
What would I say to her?

651
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,922
"You know, honey,

652
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:29,007
"every time I'm about
to go into battle,

653
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,343
"I record a message
for you and Molly,

654
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:34,179
telling you how much
I love you, just in case."

655
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,807
She'd probably
think it was sweet.

656
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:40,143
It'd probably scare
the hell out of her.

657
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:43,188
To be honest,
it scares the hell out of<i> me.</i>

658
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:45,858
Every time I record
one of these, I think,

659
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:47,484
"This is it.

660
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:50,487
This is the one they're
going to end up hearing."

661
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,238
It'll never happen.

662
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,949
What makes you say that?

663
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:57,661
Because when you've lived
eight lifetimes,

664
00:33:57,661 --> 00:34:00,330
you develop certain instincts.

665
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:05,002
And my instincts tell me
that you, Miles Edward O'Brien,

666
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:08,005
are going to live to be 140
and die in bed,

667
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:10,757
surrounded by family
and friends.

668
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,759
Do you really believe that?

669
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,469
Do<i> you?</i>

670
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,015
I'd like to.

671
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:20,392
That's all that matters.

672
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:24,103
Well, just to be
on the safe side,

673
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:27,440
maybe you'd better enter this
in the ship's log anyway.

674
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,027
I'll put it right alongside
my message to my mother.

675
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:32,362
You record these, too?

676
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:34,031
Doesn't everyone?

677
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,619
Sir.

678
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,458
Well, it looks like
the upgraded reactant injectors

679
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,460
are working better
than we thought.

680
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,882
Captain.
Mr. Worf.

681
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:53,717
Battle drills ended
ten minutes ago.

682
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:56,094
You should be
in your quarters.
I'm on my way.

683
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,179
It looks like you
got a little lost.

684
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,139
There is something
I wish to discuss with you.

685
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:05,771
Go on.

686
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:07,606
It has come to my attention

687
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,858
that First Omet'iklan
has threatened to kill you.

688
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:11,777
I didn't know that
was public knowledge.

689
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:13,653
You told Commander Dax.

690
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,948
Well, that explains it.

691
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:18,867
She<i> is</i> concerned about you,
and for good reason.

692
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,493
As your Executive Officer,

693
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,954
I recommend that you
remain on the ship

694
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:23,580
during the away mission.

695
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,916
That way, Omet'iklan
will have no opportunity

696
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:27,459
to carry out his threat.

697
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:31,046
I appreciate the concern,
but do you really think

698
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,505
I'm going to follow
that recommendation?

699
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,132
No, sir, I do not.

700
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,010
But I hope you
<i>will</i> take some advice.

701
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:40,055
Do not turn your back on him.

702
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:42,015
I won't.

703
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:43,600
Good.

704
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:48,271
I also want you to know,

705
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:52,484
if somehow he does carry out
his threat...

706
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:55,654
he will not live
to boast about it.

707
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:03,495
That's... very reassuring,
Mr. Worf.

708
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,038
Dax to Sisko.

709
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:06,748
Go ahead.

710
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:09,042
We're approaching Vandros IV.
Captain.

711
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,669
On my way.

712
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,858
I'm waiting.

713
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,619
Don't worry.
These aren't like the ones

714
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,245
we gave you
during the drill.

715
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,622
They're fully charged.

716
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,750
The weapon's set on "stun."

717
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:53,795
Deactivate safeties.

718
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:56,131
Reset weapons...

719
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,716
to maximum power.

720
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:05,306
Well, this is a
momentous occasion--

721
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:08,309
the first joint
operation between
the Federation

722
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,562
and the Dominion.

723
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:13,523
I can't wait to see
how it turns out.

724
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:15,025
Prepare to transport.

725
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:16,275
Wait.

726
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:19,445
I am First
Omet'iklan.

727
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,823
And I am dead.

728
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:24,159
As of this moment,

729
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,494
we are all dead.

730
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,538
We go into battle...

731
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:31,290
to reclaim our lives.

732
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,085
This we do gladly,

733
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:34,878
for we are Jem'Hadar.

734
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:36,295
Remember--

735
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:39,465
victory is life.

736
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,885
JEM'HADAR:
Victory is life.

737
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,396
Such a delightful people.

738
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,607
I am Chief Miles
Edward O'Brien.

739
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,192
I'm very much alive,

740
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:59,027
and I intend
to stay that way.

741
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:00,445
Amen.

742
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,321
Let's get it done.

743
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:24,928
You betrayed us.

744
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:26,221
What are you
talking about?

745
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,973
Our rifles
are sabotaged.

746
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:29,099
Hold on.

747
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:31,476
Mine's dead, too.

748
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,478
Something must be interfering
with our equipment.

749
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,230
The gateway.

750
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,190
It's probably generating
some kind of dampening field.

751
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,985
If that's the case,
we'd better come up
with a new plan.

752
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,654
(<i> yells in pain</i> )

753
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:44,114
(<i> Jem'Hadar grunting</i> )

754
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,618
(<i> groans</i> )

755
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,841
We lost Ramirez, too.

756
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,260
It would appear
we no longer have

757
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,511
the element
of surprise.

758
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:07,679
I suppose
you want

759
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,722
to call off
the mission.

760
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:12,767
Guess again.

761
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:48,011
Worf.

762
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:53,892
This way.

763
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:57,854
Go ahead.
We'll hold them off.

764
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,026
(<i> yells</i> )

765
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,654
Keep moving.

766
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:11,409
Virak'kara,
are you still there?!

767
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,371
For a little while longer.

768
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:15,538
Don't worry!

769
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,165
You'll make honored...

770
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,833
elder... yet.

771
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:25,924
JEM'HADAR:
Down that way!

772
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:29,052
Look down that hall.
Over there.

773
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:31,512
I think we have waited
long enough.

774
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,272
(<i> all grunt</i> )

775
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,572
You're sure
the explosives

776
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,157
won't be affected
by the gateway?

777
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,992
The primary detonator
might not work,

778
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,452
but the chemical backup
should do the trick.

779
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,954
The way is clear.

780
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:58,164
Let's move.

781
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,091
(<i> yells</i> )

782
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,637
(<i> yells</i> )

783
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,400
(<i> yells</i> )

784
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,193
(<i> groaning</i> )

785
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,739
I threatened to kill you,

786
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,492
but you were willing
to sacrifice yourself

787
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,286
to save my life.

788
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:37,495
Looks that way.

789
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,038
Why?

790
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,624
If you have to ask,
you'll never understand.

791
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,001
O'BRIEN:
Gentlemen,

792
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,961
I think it's time
we were leaving.

793
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:47,339
(<i> explosive beeping rapidly</i> )

794
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,091
Let's go.

795
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:54,929
If I were you,
I'd run like hell.

796
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,685
What about Dax
and the others?

797
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,061
WORF:
Here, Captain.

798
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:07,817
(<i> explosion</i> )

799
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:09,152
So much for the gateway.

800
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:10,987
Our weapons are
working again.

801
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:20,497
The<i> Defiant's</i> sensors
registered a powerful explosion

802
00:42:20,497 --> 00:42:22,165
in the vicinity of the gateway.

803
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:24,000
I trust your mission
was a success?

804
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,461
The gateway's been destroyed,
if that's what you mean.

805
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:29,922
(<i> laughing</i> )

806
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,716
Well done, Captain.

807
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:33,592
You've all done
quite nicely.

808
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,136
Now, if you
don't mind,

809
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:37,763
I'd like to inspect
the wreckage.

810
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,145
That was for questioning...

811
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:45,938
our loyalty.

812
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,359
I think

813
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,111
there's been enough
killing for one day.

814
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:58,493
The Vorta will have
no further use of this.

815
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,995
My men and I
will remain here.

816
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:06,042
There are still disloyal
Jem'Hadar on this planet.

817
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:09,712
They must be hunted down
and eliminated.

818
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,173
Good luck.

819
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,050
You fought well.

820
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,929
But the next time we meet...

821
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,807
we'll be enemies.

822
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:25,144
I'll keep that in mind.

823
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,531
I don't know about the rest
of you, but I'd like
to get out of here.

824
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:40,076
Sisko to<i> Defiant.</i>

825
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:41,827
Begin transport.
