1
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:22,606
So, what do you think
of the O'Briens' plan

2
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,859
to name their baby Sean?

3
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:27,068
Well, I kind of like it.

4
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:29,237
Sean... has a nice ring to it.

5
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:32,950
Except that in Bajoran
<i>sean</i> means "swamp."

6
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,743
Do the O'Briens know that?

7
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,244
I doubt it.

8
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:37,913
Someone should tell them.

9
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,498
I nominate you.

10
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,459
DAX:
Morning.

11
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,715
Neck bothering you again?

12
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:51,259
It's... it's just a muscle pull.

13
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,678
What is that?

14
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:55,430
The eighth muscle pull
this month?

15
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,976
Actually, I believe
Commander Dax has been treated

16
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:01,144
for seven muscle pulls,

17
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,438
two contusions, and
three cracked ribs.

18
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,774
The only person who's spent
more time in the Infirmary

19
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:09,444
over the past few weeks
is... Commander Worf.

20
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:12,948
Isn't there any way the...
the two of you could, uh...

21
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:14,950
uh, you know...

22
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,243
Make love?

23
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,161
Without injuring yourselves?

24
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:21,289
Interspecies romance
isn't without its danger.

25
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,918
That's part of the fun.

26
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,880
Maybe we'll have
better luck on Risa.

27
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,172
Risa?

28
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,799
I thought you and Worf

29
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,509
were taking your
vacation on Earth.

30
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,929
That was his suggestion.

31
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:35,888
I changed his mind.

32
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,472
ODO:
From what I hear

33
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:42,269
Risa make the Hoobishan Baths
look like a monastery.

34
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,354
I hope they have
a good hospital.

35
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,814
(<i> chuckling</i> )

36
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,525
SISKO:
I can't believe

37
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:51,653
you actually convinced Worf
to go to a pleasure planet.

38
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,073
He must really be loosening up.

39
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:56,825
I hadn't noticed it.

40
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,619
Come to think of it,
neither have I.

41
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,162
Oh, no, he's still
the same old Worf.

42
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,706
Prune juice, extra large.

43
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,499
See what I mean?

44
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:07,044
Worf.

45
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,634
Captain, Constable...

46
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,095
Commander.

47
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:19,306
Uh, Dax said...
you were going to Risa.

48
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,058
Did she?

49
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,435
Well, it's no secret.

50
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,520
Apparently not.

51
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,481
You must be
looking forward to it.

52
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,566
I'm looking forward
to spending some time alone

53
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,318
with Lieutenant Commander Dax.

54
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,153
Isn't he sweet?

55
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,156
We have much to discuss.

56
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,365
About what?

57
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,242
It is a private matter.

58
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,201
Oh.

59
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,578
DAX:
Worf's upset

60
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,455
because I had lunch
with Captain Boday.

61
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:44,706
The Gallamite?

62
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,959
His skull is transparent.

63
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,251
And if you couldn't see
his brains,

64
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,837
would it make you
feel any better?

65
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,505
It is not proper
for you to have lunch

66
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,882
with an ex-lover
while we are together.

67
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,384
We were just talking.

68
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,386
You have to learn
to trust me a little more.

69
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,221
WORF:
I do trust you.

70
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:04,018
I do not trust Captain Boday.

71
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:06,020
Well...

72
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,064
I can see it's going to be
quite a trip.

73
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,317
Well, the two of you
have to tell us

74
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,153
all about it
when you get back.

75
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:16,279
I am sure<i> she</i> will.

76
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,953
I do not see why you
feel the need to talk

77
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,288
about our personal lives
to other people.

78
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,874
And I don't see why
you feel the need

79
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,750
to control my every move.

80
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,377
And they're not other people.

81
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:33,380
Benjamin and Odo are my friends.

82
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,132
BASHIR:
Jadzia.

83
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,133
Hey.

84
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,134
Worf.

85
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,468
We've been looking for you.

86
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,803
Um, I've been thinking
about this trip

87
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,096
you're taking
to Risa.

88
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,430
He's a friend, too.

89
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,974
LEETA:
Julian and I
were talking it over,

90
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,893
and we'd like
to come along...

91
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,186
if that's all right.

92
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,271
Actually, we were hoping

93
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,273
to spend some time
alone together.

94
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,775
Oh, you'll have it.

95
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,986
Oh, once we get to Risa,
you won't even see us.

96
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,991
There's no harm
in sharing a runabout.

97
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,161
I suppose not.

98
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:06,038
Oh!
Thank you so much!

99
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:07,956
I'm going
to go pack.

100
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,249
Commander...

101
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,667
Do not hug me.

102
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,128
I promise we'll keep
out of your hair.

103
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,838
Good.

104
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:18,383
Because we have
much to discuss.

105
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,229
I really wish
I was going with you.

106
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:33,356
Dax and I had
some great times on Risa.

107
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,358
(<i> laughing</i> )

108
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,194
Curzon Dax.

109
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,904
Curzon.

110
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:40,072
Of course.

111
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,910
Have fun.

112
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,042
It's about time you got here.

113
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,962
The rest of us were ready
to leave an hour ago.

114
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,880
What is he doing here?

115
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,924
I've always wanted
to go to Risa,

116
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,217
and this seemed like
a perfect opportunity.

117
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,635
He wouldn't
give me any time off

118
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,095
unless we promised
to take him with us.

119
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,721
I hope this isn't
going to be a problem.

120
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,057
QUARK:
Why should it
be a problem?

121
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,725
We're going to have
a wonderful time.

122
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,228
Now, if you don't mind,
Risa awaits.

123
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,231
Sorry.

124
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,862
Jadzia...

125
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,449
I know, I know.

126
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,618
We have much to discuss.

127
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:39,459
Let's see... that's
a Tarkalean tea for you,

128
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,669
a<i> raktajino</i> for you,

129
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,588
and an extra large
prune juice.

130
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,715
Leeta, you're on vacation,
not at Quark's.

131
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,050
You don't have
to serve us.

132
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,468
Oh, it gives me
something to do.

133
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,053
Space travel's so dull.

134
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,555
Have you ever noticed
how all stars look the same?

135
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,058
Excuse me...

136
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,394
but I believe I ordered
a snail juice--

137
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:58,395
hand-squeezed.

138
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,479
Get it yourself.

139
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,730
I'm on vacation.

140
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,690
How much longer
till we get there?

141
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,609
DAX:
Another six hours.

142
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,278
QUARK:
Six hours?

143
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:08,488
Tell the Ferengi
to return to his cabin.

144
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,115
You call that a cabin?

145
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,575
It's a cot
and a waste disposal unit.

146
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,036
It's so small
even I can't stand up in there.

147
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,247
Look-- I'm developing a slouch.

148
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,833
Tell the Ferengi
to return to his cabin<i> now.</i>

149
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,042
Quark...

150
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,252
What's he going to do?

151
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,004
Turn around
and take me home?

152
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,046
Ruin everyone's vacation?

153
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,214
Coming about.

154
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,548
Setting course

155
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,549
for Deep Space 9.

156
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,427
Okay, okay.

157
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:31,970
You made your point.

158
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,596
I'm going.

159
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:37,558
But first, I have
a little present for everyone.

160
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,269
One for you.

161
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,356
And one for you.

162
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:45,608
And one for you.

163
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,320
And none for you.

164
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,404
What's this?

165
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,738
It's a<i> Horga'hn.</i>

166
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:54,159
A Risian fertility symbol.

167
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,576
Displaying one
to the locals

168
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,788
indicates you're
seeking<i> jamaharon.</i>

169
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,581
LEETA:
What's<i> jamaharon?</i>

170
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:04,378
I'll show you later.

171
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,046
Oh.

172
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,131
Look.

173
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,633
They like each other.

174
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,011
I think I'm going
to be sick.

175
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,263
<i>All right.</i> I'm going.

176
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,307
Me, too.

177
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,061
Going? Where?

178
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,855
I'm going to change
into something more comfortable.

179
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,773
You don't think
I'm going to beam down to Risa

180
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,984
dressed like this, do you?

181
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,653
That's a good idea.

182
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,659
When in Rome...

183
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,163
(<i> sighs</i> )

184
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,397
Oh!

185
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:08,358
I can't believe
we finally made it.

186
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:13,029
Well, enjoy your vacation.

187
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,406
Mmm. We will.

188
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:17,658
Time to test
these babies out.

189
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,161
Ladies...

190
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,291
You seek<i> jamaharon?</i>

191
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,210
I seek whatever you've got.

192
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,588
All that is ours
is yours.

193
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,385
I'll take it.

194
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,224
Aren't you uncomfortable
in that uniform?

195
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,643
Starfleet uniforms
are designed for comfort,

196
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,646
even in the most
extreme environments.

197
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,689
Well, you look
out of place.

198
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,484
I mean, look around you.

199
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,026
Isn't it beautiful?

200
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,154
It is an artificially
created paradise,

201
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,781
maintained by the most elaborate
weather control system

202
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,241
in the Federation.

203
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,452
In its natural state,
Risa is nothing more

204
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:03,163
than a rain-soaked,
geologically
unstable jungle.

205
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,664
Maybe so,

206
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,584
but the only dark cloud
I see around here is<i> you.</i>

207
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,044
I did not come here
to admire the scenery.

208
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,963
If you say so.

209
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:13,965
I guess we should
just go home.

210
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,800
Well, maybe...

211
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,263
I would not be so hasty.

212
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,432
I take it
the scenery has improved.

213
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,935
A few months ago

214
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,562
when I was commanding
the<i> Defiant</i>

215
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,439
on a scouting mission
in the Gamma Quadrant,

216
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,650
we encountered
a protostar cluster--

217
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,318
a swirling mass of color

218
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,612
set against
a background

219
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,156
of glowing clouds
and burning sky.

220
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:42,160
It was the most beautiful thing
I'd ever seen...

221
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,078
until now.

222
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:49,250
I've got to take you
on vacation more often.

223
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,838
Dax, is that you?

224
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,216
Arandis.

225
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,259
I was wondering
if you were still here.

226
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,053
Oh!

227
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,514
Not only am I still here,
I have been promoted.

228
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:05,600
I'm Chief Facilitator for
the entire Temtibi Lagoon.

229
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,311
Worf, this is Arandis.

230
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,728
A friend
of Curzon's.

231
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,606
She and Curzon spent
a lot of time together

232
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,525
on his last trip here.

233
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,694
We had a wonderful time
together...

234
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:17,153
until I killed him.

235
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,321
Killed him?!

236
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:21,074
Death by<i> jamaharon.</i>

237
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,493
I suppose there
are worse ways to go.

238
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:26,162
Trust me, he died happy.

239
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,623
He was such a sweet old man.

240
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,500
I will take your word for it.

241
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,878
It's so good
to see you again, Dax.

242
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,381
Your new host
is very attractive.

243
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:37,340
Thank you.

244
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,299
I'd like to think so.

245
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,926
You haven't aged
a day.

246
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,345
Ah... Risa's been
very kind to me.

247
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,097
Come, let me
show you around.

248
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,348
Maybe later.

249
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,602
Of course.

250
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,562
All that is ours is yours.

251
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:51,812
Thank you.

252
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,523
But we have everything we need.

253
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,408
That wasn't very nice.

254
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,910
Why? Is there something
of hers you want?

255
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,871
Arandis was Curzon's lover,
not mine.

256
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,665
I hope you
remember that.

257
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:13,293
You're still angry
about Captain Boday.

258
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,336
If I<i> am</i> angry, it is because

259
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:18,339
you do not take our
relationship seriously.

260
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,466
Worf, we just got here.

261
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,426
Do we have
to start arguing again?

262
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:25,096
If you were a Klingon woman,
we would already be married.

263
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,724
In case you haven't noticed,
I am not a Klingon woman.

264
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,601
That is no excuse.

265
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:32,979
I have been loyal to you,
and I expect you to be loyal

266
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,314
to me in return.

267
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,940
I have been loyal to you,

268
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,984
but I'm not going
to let you run my life.

269
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,902
I'm not trying to run your life.

270
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,321
Then I'm going to go

271
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,490
and have a big glass
of icoberry juice.

272
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,074
That is a mistake.

273
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,535
You are allergic
to icoberry juice.

274
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,162
It makes your...

275
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,705
spots itch.

276
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,248
But I like the taste.

277
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:56,002
Fine. Have as much
icoberry juice as you like,

278
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,671
but it is still a mistake.

279
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,922
But it is my mistake
to make.

280
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,509
Now, why don't you
go up to our room

281
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:06,262
and put on your bathing suit
so we can swim in the lagoon?

282
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,017
As you wish.

283
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,938
(<i> door chimes</i> )

284
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,565
Enter.

285
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,112
I hope I'm not disturbing you,

286
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,447
Lieutenant Commander.

287
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,448
My name is

288
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,033
Pascal Fullerton.

289
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,035
I'm the chairman of the
New Essentialists Movement.

290
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,245
I'm not familiar
with that organization.

291
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,997
We're dedicated to restoring

292
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,958
the moral and cultural
traditions of the Federation.

293
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,753
This is a statement
of our principles.

294
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,296
But if you would
like to hear more,

295
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,716
we're holding a rally
later this afternoon.

296
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:43,800
On Risa?

297
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,426
What better place?

298
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,887
This world revels in the kind
of self-indulgence

299
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,641
that's eroding the foundations
of Federation society.

300
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,685
We intend to shut it down.

301
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,241
I really wish you'd
stop reading that.

302
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,993
I would not dismiss
Fullerton so quickly.

303
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,287
His analysis
of recent Federation history

304
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,748
is both insightful
and disturbing.

305
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,332
What's really
disturbing

306
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,084
is that you're still
wearing your uniform.

307
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:21,337
It would not hurt you
to read this.

308
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,091
LEETA:
Mmm...

309
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,594
mmm!

310
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,346
Well, the truth is

311
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,473
not everyone can
be a dabo girl.

312
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,392
First of all,

313
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:36,352
you have to be able
to wear the clothes,

314
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,021
and believe me,
that's not easy.

315
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,648
You have to be able

316
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,568
to calculate odds in
your head very quickly,

317
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,111
and most importantly,

318
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,739
you need a very
supple wrist...

319
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,365
like this.

320
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,119
Dabo.

321
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,788
DAX:
...the end of
the Federation

322
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,497
since the day
it was founded.

323
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,749
Trust me. I know.

324
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:58,875
Oh, hi!

325
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,710
Leeta, what a surprise.

326
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,961
Care to join us?

327
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,797
We were just about
to take a reyamilk soak.

328
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,549
Maybe later.

329
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,676
Worf.

330
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,428
<i>Worf.</i>

331
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,558
(<i> sigh of contentment</i> )

332
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,478
That was not Dr. Bashir.

333
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,980
It's none of our business.

334
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,982
Are you defending
her actions?

335
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,400
I am not
defending anything,

336
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,444
but it's not my
business or yours.

337
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,529
Now, what do you
say we go sign out

338
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,115
a couple of floaters
and take in the sights?

339
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,283
I cannot.

340
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:33,993
The Essentialists
are having a rally,

341
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,328
and I plan to attend.

342
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,037
(<i> sighs</i> ):
You're kidding.

343
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,792
You're not kidding.

344
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:53,638
Don't these people have
anything better to do?

345
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,431
Perhaps you
underestimate

346
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,058
the power of
Fullerton's message.

347
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,019
The plot thickens.

348
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,063
And you were worried

349
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,107
about Julian.

350
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,362
Why are he and Leeta
not together?

351
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,281
I don't know, but don't
jump to conclusions.

352
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,075
I'm sure there's
a reasonable explanation.

353
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,912
This place is
a bad influence on people.

354
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,747
ARANDIS:
Here for the show?

355
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,166
I would not call it
a show.

356
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,252
Really? I find Mr. Fullerton
very entertaining.

357
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,254
He seems
pretty determined

358
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,799
to discourage people
from coming here.

359
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,926
Risa receives millions
of visitors every year.

360
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:34,053
And all of them leave happier
than when they've arrived.

361
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,429
I don't see how one man,

362
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,306
no matter how determined,
can change that.

363
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,267
Kahless fought off an entire
army at Three Turn Bridge,

364
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,895
and<i> he</i> was only one man.

365
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,229
Fullerton and his
Essentialists

366
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,689
have been here
for about a month,

367
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,566
and no matter
how many speeches he gives,

368
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:50,570
the water's still warm,
and the wind still smells sweet.

369
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:54,156
But, if he's enjoying himself,
who are we to discourage him?

370
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,493
(<i> scattered applause</i> )

371
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,291
That's right.

372
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,085
Take a good look.

373
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,338
I can only imagine
what you must think of me--

374
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,925
a middle-aged,
ponderous academic,

375
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,593
sweating under
the hot Risian suns,

376
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,178
wasting his time
telling you things

377
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,639
you don't want
to hear.

378
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:22,268
But you know what I see
when I look at you?

379
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,937
Children...

380
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:27,273
pampered, spoiled children.

381
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:30,401
For some reason, the
citizens of the Federation

382
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:31,736
have come to believe

383
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,613
that they are entitled
to lives of ease....

384
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,822
I may be wrong,

385
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:35,990
but didn't he
just insult us?

386
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,324
If you want
something to eat,

387
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,201
you get it from
a replicator.

388
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:43,039
If you want amusement,
you go to a holosuite,

389
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,501
and if you need protection,
you call for Starfleet.

390
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,629
But someday...

391
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,297
someday soon,

392
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,173
you're going to
have to learn

393
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,801
to take care
of yourselves,

394
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,553
because if<i> I</i> see you
as helpless children,

395
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,139
then how do you think
the Borg see you?

396
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,977
Or the Romulans or the Klingons
or the Dominion?

397
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,479
These empires look
at the Federation,

398
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,606
and they see a prize--

399
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:11,567
a prize that we have
forgotten how to protect,

400
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,028
and if we don't change our ways,

401
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,322
they're going to take it
from us.

402
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:19,951
Mr. Fullerton has quite
a flair for the dramatic.

403
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,369
Does he<i> really</i> believe that?

404
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,496
I think he does.

405
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,039
...and re-embrace

406
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,874
the kind of hard work

407
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,877
that built the Federation
in the first place.

408
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,463
Or we can lie here,
napping in the sun,

409
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,423
until we wake up

410
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:38,678
with Jem'Hadar guns
to our heads.

411
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:42,431
The choice is ours.

412
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,267
Heaven help us
if we make the wrong one.

413
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,357
BASHIR:
What<i> are</i> you
talking about?

414
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,400
Come on, Worf, this sounds
like nonsense.

415
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,819
I am merely observing

416
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,445
that the Klingons would
never have attacked

417
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,865
had they not believed
the Federation vulnerable.

418
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,491
Even now, since
the changeling

419
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,242
was discovered on the
Klingon High Council,

420
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,620
most of my people
continue to call for war,

421
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,998
because they think
they can win.

422
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:09,500
None of this has
anything to do with Risa.

423
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,710
You cannot be certain of that.

424
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,211
DAX:
All I know is

425
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,463
I've spent lifetimes
defending the Federation,

426
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,299
and I deserve a vacation
every now and then.

427
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:19,886
Julian?

428
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,014
Oh,<i> there</i> you are.

429
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:24,682
I am so glad we came here.

430
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:27,267
I'm having
the most wonderful time.

431
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,103
I told you this was
just what we needed.

432
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,146
Mmm...

433
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:33,941
Something wrong?

434
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,651
It's nothing.

435
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,946
You two dishonor each other
with your actions.

436
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,323
Do you know
what he's talking about?

437
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:46,245
You mean... we didn't tell you
why we came here?

438
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,999
We're conducting
the Rite of Separation.

439
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,959
It's an old Bajoran custom.

440
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,669
When a couple separates,

441
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,047
they spend several days
celebrating their parting.

442
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:59,217
It's a way to remember
all the good times

443
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:02,595
and to seek out
new opportunities.

444
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,723
A very wise and ancient culture.

445
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,516
LEETA:
You know, Julian,

446
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,309
I don't think

447
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,021
I've completely gotten you
out of my system yet.

448
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,481
I know exactly
what you mean.

449
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,275
Excuse us.

450
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:20,362
Um, we have a few...
details to work out.

451
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,579
Terminating
a relationship

452
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,748
should not be taken
so frivolously.

453
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,458
Not every relationship

454
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,501
has to end like
a Klingon opera.

455
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,087
Oh, no, no.

456
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:37,964
Just the ones that
are important.

457
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,382
(<i> furniture breaking</i> )

458
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,553
Stay where you are.

459
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,443
On three.

460
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,112
One, two...

461
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:02,155
Wait.

462
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:03,739
That's enough.

463
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:09,369
Well... I hope
we've proved our point.

464
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,415
The power cells
are empty.

465
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,793
We have no intention
of harming anyone.

466
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,045
I don't understand.

467
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:21,507
You think you're safe here
in this "paradise" of yours,

468
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,009
but you're not.

469
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,844
What if we had been Jem'Hadar

470
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,096
or Klingons
or Romulans.

471
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,430
Hmm?

472
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,557
You'd be dead now.

473
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,060
Even you-- Starfleet officers--

474
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,022
were lulled into a false
sense of security.

475
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,398
If you could be taken unaware,

476
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:41,485
what chance
do the rest of us have?

477
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:44,030
The sad truth is

478
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,033
the galaxy is a hostile place.

479
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:51,912
Forget that, even for a moment,
and you risk losing<i> everything.</i>

480
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,706
Just something
for you

481
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:57,251
to think about while you wait
for your desserts.

482
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,920
All right.

483
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,921
Come on, demonstration's over.

484
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,298
Move along, move along.

485
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,591
As a Starfleet officer,
I have the authority

486
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,927
to arrest you
for what you just did.

487
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,721
But that would be
a waste of time.

488
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,681
We both know the Risians
won't prosecute.

489
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:13,351
They don't have
the courage for it.

490
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:15,435
Believe me, I wish they did.

491
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,812
Commander Worf...

492
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:20,191
what did you think of
our little demonstration?

493
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:23,277
I cannot condone
what you have done.

494
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:24,486
Maybe not...

495
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,655
but I do think
you understand it.

496
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,839
(<i> sighs</i> )

497
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:51,138
I don't know about you,
but it's past my bedtime.

498
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:54,725
We need to talk.

499
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,186
About the Essentialists?

500
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:59,397
No. About us.

501
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:03,567
Oh, I suppose you have another
list of things I'm doing wrong.

502
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,570
I did not say you were
doing anything wrong.

503
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,030
It's just that...

504
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,324
some of your behavior...

505
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:11,992
What about my behavior?

506
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,452
At times, you are too impulsive.

507
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:16,372
You-you act without thinking.

508
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,207
You have no
self-control.

509
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,542
And you think
I need you to control me?

510
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:25,131
Jadzia, you are my<i> par'machkai,</i>

511
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:28,259
and that means everything
you do reflects on me.

512
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:30,303
I'm sorry if I embarrass you.

513
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:34,348
I just need to know
that you take this relationship

514
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,142
as seriously
as I do.

515
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:38,644
And I just wish
you'd relax a little

516
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:41,647
and let yourself enjoy
what we have together.

517
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:50,156
Worf, I'm not going
to change who I am.

518
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:52,366
Nor am I.

519
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:55,577
Well, at least we agree
on something.

520
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,581
(<i> sighs</i> )

521
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,543
Why don't we go to bed?

522
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,379
You go.

523
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:08,090
I will be there shortly.

524
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,592
(<i> sighs</i> )

525
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:16,015
(<i> sighs</i> )

526
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,564
This place looks
a lot better

527
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,150
than it did
last night.

528
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,361
I guess the Risians
aren't as lethargic

529
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:31,071
as the Essentialists would
like everyone to believe.

530
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,782
The Essentialists are
wrong about many things.

531
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:38,204
What Mr. Fullerton could use
is a little<i> jamaharon.</i>

532
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:39,579
No...

533
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,123
a lot of<i> jamaharon.</i>

534
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:47,129
I'd buy him a<i> Horga'hn</i> myself
if I thought he'd take it.

535
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,923
(<i> sighs</i> )

536
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,717
It looks like
he's not the only one

537
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,177
that could use some cheering up.

538
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:55,762
I've had better vacations.

539
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,264
Better than Risa?

540
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,641
(<i> sighs</i> )

541
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,519
I've never known a Klingon

542
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:04,438
who had a tougher time
enjoying himself.

543
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:07,107
That's no reason for you
not to have a good time.

544
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,277
Risa is famous
for its diversions.

545
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:13,447
I wish it were that simple.

546
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,324
It was for Curzon Dax.

547
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:16,325
Yeah.

548
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:17,701
And I can tell

549
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,287
there's more
than a little Curzon in you.

550
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:23,249
He loved this planet.

551
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:25,209
And Risa loved him.

552
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:29,422
Why don't I help you clean up?

553
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,009
All that is ours is yours.

554
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,264
LEETA:
Our paths have grown apart.

555
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,441
What was one is now two.

556
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:54,612
The time for sharing
is over.

557
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,703
May the Prophets guide you

558
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,621
toward the path of happiness.

559
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:06,875
And may they walk
with you always.

560
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,307
That's it?

561
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:22,766
That's it.

562
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,268
What were
you expecting?

563
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:26,312
I was expecting
fireworks.

564
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:27,813
Where's the anger?

565
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,773
The vicious
name-calling?

566
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,400
The irrational
accusations?

567
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,486
I never would have agreed
to be a witness

568
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:36,489
if I'd known you were going
to be so<i> civil.</i>

569
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:37,990
It's disgusting.

570
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,908
Personally, I think
it was admirable--

571
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,952
no recriminations,
no hurt feelings.

572
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,371
I don't think I've
ever felt this good

573
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,039
about the end
of a relationship.

574
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,416
Oh, I agree.

575
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,960
Now I can finally be honest
about my feelings.

576
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,338
What... does
that mean?

577
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:55,174
It's just...

578
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,551
in the past
few months,

579
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:02,264
I've been... thinking a lot
about another man.

580
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:03,681
Ahh...

581
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,267
Let me get
this straight.

582
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,394
While you were still
dating Julian here,

583
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,896
you were having fantasies
about someone else?

584
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,857
I'd rather not discuss it now.

585
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,150
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You brought it up.

586
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,361
You might as well
tell me who it is.

587
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:16,736
Yes, do tell.

588
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,071
(<i> sighs</i> )

589
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,615
It's...

590
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,077
Me?

591
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,912
Your brother...

592
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,456
Rom.

593
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,583
My brother Rom?

594
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,126
His brother Rom?

595
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,295
He's so cute...

596
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:35,422
and very sexy.

597
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,466
"Cute"?

598
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,092
"Sexy"?

599
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,011
Rom?
Rom?

600
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,389
Here.

601
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,432
You need this
more than I do.

602
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:03,075
ARANDIS:
Just close your eyes
and watch your body.

603
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,952
Let all the tension drain away.

604
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:08,330
Doesn't the clay feel good?

605
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,123
Wonderful.

606
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:13,419
Now pour your emotions
into it.

607
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,087
Begin to mold it.

608
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,297
Feel the texture
in your hands.

609
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,632
I do.

610
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:21,176
I feel it.
I really do.

611
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,762
I knew you'd get it.

612
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,723
Dax.

613
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:27,433
Worf!

614
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,272
Worf?

615
00:29:58,756 --> 00:30:00,840
I'm tired of giving speeches.

616
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,468
It's time we took action.

617
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:05,053
We've taken action--
the raid on the solarium.

618
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,639
It'll be forgotten
by tomorrow.

619
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:08,098
(<i> door opens</i> )

620
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,727
Mr. Worf?

621
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:18,484
You want to make
people leave Risa...

622
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:20,736
I think I know a way.

623
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,455
I probably would have reacted
the same way Worf did.

624
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:34,583
I mean, I know Arandis is
Curzon's lover, not yours

625
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:37,210
but if I'd walked in on the two
of you together, well...

626
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,755
trying to figure you out
at any given time isn't easy.

627
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:41,131
I like that
about her.

628
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:42,633
So do I.

629
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:44,426
It's the reason why I
chased after her so long.

630
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,219
Would you two please

631
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,597
stop talking about me
like I'm not here?

632
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:51,183
It's also the reason why I
stopped chasing after her.

633
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,643
You're too much work.

634
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:54,978
<i>Worf</i> is the one
who's too much work.

635
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,897
What you need is a Ferengi.

636
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,316
Maybe,

637
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:02,235
but what I want is Worf.

638
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,696
Why?

639
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:08,158
Because he has the courage
of a berserker cat,

640
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:10,786
and he has the heart of a poet.

641
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:13,079
And the brain
of a pigheaded idiot.

642
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,290
Yeah, sometimes.

643
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,043
Jadzia.

644
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,044
Any luck?

645
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,379
I'm afraid not.

646
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,797
None of the staff
can find him,

647
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,298
but I'm sure
he'll turn up.

648
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:26,385
Well, no sense
waiting around here for him.

649
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:28,470
I say we take some floaters
up into the hills

650
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,014
and go skinny-dipping
in the hot springs.

651
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,391
I never thought
I'd say this,

652
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,517
but I'm with Quark.

653
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:35,602
What was that?

654
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,937
Great. Just
what we needed.

655
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,439
I thought it wasn't
supposed to rain

656
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,440
in this part of Risa.

657
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,275
It's not.

658
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,528
Something must be wrong
with the weather grid.

659
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,572
(<i> thunder rumbles</i> )

660
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,374
May I have your
attention, please.

661
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:59,710
Obviously, the weather grid
is experiencing

662
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,420
some type of malfunction,

663
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,381
but I'm sure we'll be able
to repair it soon.

664
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:05,591
No...

665
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,092
you won't.

666
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,927
You're responsible
for this.

667
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,597
Oh, I authorized it,
but it was not my idea.

668
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:13,390
It was mine.

669
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,100
Are you serious?

670
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,185
He's serious.

671
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,312
Worf, what did you do,
build an uplink

672
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,815
so you could take control
of the weather grid?

673
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:23,442
The grid has been deactivated.

674
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:26,027
It will take three or four days
to restore the system

675
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,404
to normal operation.

676
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:29,239
During that time,
the inhabitants of Risa

677
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,032
and their guests will experience

678
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,285
the planet's
natural weather cycle.

679
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:34,494
And for most on Risa,

680
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,496
that means rain,
and plenty of it.

681
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,874
But why are you doing this?

682
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,333
Because Risa is an illusion

683
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,795
created
by weather control systems,

684
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:45,464
industrial replicators,
seismic regulators.

685
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,258
If the Federation
is going to survive,

686
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:51,303
we're going to have to stop
wasting our time with toys

687
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,806
and get back to the essentials.

688
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:58,518
I'm beginning to think
there's no hope for that man.

689
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,061
(<i> thunder crashes</i> )

690
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,856
Or for you, either, Mr. Worf.

691
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:09,863
Commander,
with all due respect,

692
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:11,907
are you out of your mind?

693
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:14,409
Oh, I think you will find me
quite rational.

694
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,328
As rational
as Klingons get, anyway.

695
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,537
Worf, this
is wrong.

696
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,289
I disagree.

697
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:22,709
If Federation citizens cannot
handle a little bad weather,

698
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,545
how will they handle
a Dominion invasion?

699
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,933
(<i> thunder crashing,</i>
<i>wind whistling</i> )

700
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:44,105
I have seen drier days
on Ferenginar

701
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:48,026
and we have 178
different words for rain.

702
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:51,989
Right now,
it's<i> glebbening</i> out there,

703
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:53,114
and that's bad.

704
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,992
If you're so miserable,

705
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:56,535
why don't you take
your<i> Horga'hn</i>

706
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,244
and go find some company?

707
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:01,289
Have you taken a good look
at the Risians lately?

708
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,500
They're even more depressed
than the guests.

709
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:08,129
I'm trying to organize
a game of hoverball.

710
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,756
Would either of you
like to join us?

711
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:10,966
In the rain?

712
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,218
No, on one of the indoor courts.

713
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,887
Indoor hoverball.

714
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:17,222
That's just wrong.

715
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,515
I'll play.

716
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:21,100
Good.
That makes one.

717
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,185
Having trouble

718
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,645
keeping the guests happy?

719
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:26,064
I've never heard
so much complaining in my life.

720
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,233
Nobody came here
to sit around in the rain.

721
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,027
It's not just
the weather.

722
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:33,154
People are starting
to complain about everything--

723
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,240
the rooms, the entertainment,
the food.

724
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,576
What's wrong with the food?

725
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,285
Nothing, as far as I can tell,

726
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:42,247
but the guests say
it just doesn't taste right.

727
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:43,916
It's the humidity.

728
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,083
It dampens the food,

729
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,377
makes everything mushy.

730
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:51,339
Trust me. There's no word
for "crisp" on Ferenginar.

731
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,426
Maybe Mr. Fullerton
was right.

732
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:57,679
Maybe we have forgotten
how to deal with adversity.

733
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:03,184
According to our figures,
the guest population

734
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,937
has declined by 30 percent
in the last three days.

735
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:07,022
And you can be sure
the guests that have stayed

736
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:09,482
are taking what you
have to say seriously.

737
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,776
It's a start.

738
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:12,402
One that you can build on.

739
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:16,197
You're leaving?

740
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,702
I have had my fill of Risa.

741
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:23,997
Mr. Worf, you've been
an inspiration to us all.

742
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:25,540
Good luck.

743
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,625
Thank you.

744
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:31,546
You still have the uplink
to the weather control grid?

745
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,423
Right here.

746
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:37,302
By tomorrow, the weather grid
will be restored to normal,

747
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:40,430
and no one here will remember
this ever happened.

748
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,978
But I intend to send a message

749
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:48,313
they won't forget.

750
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,325
You must be feeling
pretty good right now.

751
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:03,369
The weather's terrible,
the guests are miserable,

752
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:06,081
and more and more people
are leaving Risa every day.

753
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:08,750
Their response only
proves my point.

754
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,794
Oh, I see.

755
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:14,506
Ruin the vacations
of a few hundred thousand people

756
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:17,592
to bolster the moral fiber
of the Federation.

757
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:21,220
I do not expect<i> you</i>
to understand.

758
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,807
I understand...

759
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,809
even better than you do.

760
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:28,645
What you did had nothing
to do with Risa

761
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:33,274
or the Essentialists,
or even the Federation.

762
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:36,361
It's about you and me.

763
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:41,867
You give yourself
far too much credit.

764
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,284
Do I?

765
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:48,623
You think I'm irresponsible,
frivolous...

766
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,625
that I care more
about pleasure

767
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,086
than I do commitment.

768
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:57,049
What do you think is going on
between me and Arandis?

769
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:58,925
You<i> know</i> what I think.

770
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,220
That's right.
I do.

771
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,638
And you know what?

772
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,807
You're wrong.

773
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,559
Did it occur to you

774
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,728
to ask me about it?

775
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:13,690
Or... trust, just a little?

776
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:16,943
A Klingon woman would not have
given me grounds for suspicion.

777
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,737
And how would you know?

778
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:22,199
Curzon spent more time
with Klingons than you ever did.

779
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:25,577
You may have lived
among my people,

780
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,245
but you are not a Klingon.

781
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,287
I am.

782
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:29,831
Maybe so,

783
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:32,584
but you're not like
any Klingon I've ever met.

784
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:37,380
(<i> sighs</i> )

785
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,549
What happened to you, Worf?

786
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:43,469
You're a paragon
of Klingon honor and discipline,

787
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,680
but when it comes
to the Klingon

788
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,016
passion for life,
the exuberance,

789
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:50,143
the enjoyment of the moment,

790
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:53,521
you are constantly
holding yourself back.

791
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,314
Why?

792
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,776
That is not the issue here.

793
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,027
I think it is.

794
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:06,243
I do not wish
to lose you, Jadzia.

795
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:09,412
Then talk to me,<i> please.</i>

796
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,586
You know from the age of seven,

797
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:19,338
I was raised by humans
on the farm world of Gault.

798
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:22,008
It was a sparsely
populated world,

799
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,969
no more than 20,000 inhabitants.

800
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:29,224
It often seemed as though
everyone knew everybody else,

801
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:30,558
but one thing<i> was</i> for certain.

802
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,977
Everybody knew me.

803
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:35,814
I was the Klingon child,
the uncontrollable one.

804
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,816
I was the biggest,
the strongest,

805
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,318
the most fearless child
on the entire planet.

806
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,571
I fought hard, played hard,
did as I pleased.

807
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,324
What changed?

808
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:51,288
When I was 13, I was captain
of my school soccer team.

809
00:38:51,288 --> 00:38:56,209
We had made the championships,
and I was determined to win.

810
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,377
Near the end of the second half
with the score tied,

811
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:01,131
my team got
a corner kick.

812
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:03,382
The ball
sailed up high.

813
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:06,594
Both I and one of my opponents,
a human boy named Mikel,

814
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:09,639
leapt up to head the ball.

815
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:15,061
He had position,
but I was determined to score.

816
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,897
I remember laughing
with excitement

817
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,275
as I threw myself at him.

818
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:24,237
Go on.

819
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:27,282
(<i> sighing</i> )

820
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:28,533
The next thing I knew,

821
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,702
the ball was sailing
into their goal.

822
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:34,247
I roared with triumph

823
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:36,582
and turned around to Mikel
to gloat,

824
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:39,752
only to find him lying
in the grass bleeding.

825
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:42,130
Our heads
had collided

826
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,132
when we both went up
for the ball.

827
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,176
I had not felt the impact,

828
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:49,595
but I had broken his neck,
and...

829
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,348
he died the next day.

830
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,394
It was an accident.

831
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,313
Which only makes it worse.

832
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:02,734
Compared to Klingons,
humans are fragile creatures.

833
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,944
I realized at that moment

834
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:08,865
to live among them,
I must practice restraint.

835
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:11,617
That must have been
difficult for you.

836
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,370
At first.

837
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:16,248
In time, it became a part
of who I was--

838
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:18,833
who... I am.

839
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:23,963
And you're still afraid
that if you lose control...

840
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,887
Someone I care about
might get hurt.

841
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,892
That explains a lot...

842
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:39,645
but you have to realize

843
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:42,523
there are some things
in life you can't control,

844
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:45,360
and one of them is me.

845
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,029
But what you can do is trust me.

846
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:51,241
I care about
you, Worf,

847
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:54,994
and I would never do
anything to hurt you.

848
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,580
Nor would I do
anything to hurt you.

849
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,668
Who knows?

850
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:06,464
I may have more self-control
than you give me credit for.

851
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,384
(<i> objects clattering</i> )

852
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:11,761
That felt like
an earthquake.

853
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:14,222
(<i> rumbling</i> )

854
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,723
So did that.

855
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,392
The Essentialists.

856
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,146
You should see them all run.

857
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:23,898
I think they finally realized
that the party's over.

858
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,233
Increase the feedback

859
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:26,484
in the tectonic
stress regulators.

860
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,902
If I do, there won't be

861
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,988
a building left standing
on this part of Risa.

862
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:32,740
It might be
a good idea

863
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,409
to head to
the spaceport.

864
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,455
Or at least get
out of this room.

865
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:41,707
Very well.

866
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:44,419
I think our work
is done here.

867
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,004
WORF:
The uplink--

868
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,380
give it to me.

869
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,007
Mr. Worf, I suggest

870
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,426
you all get off this planet
as soon as possible.

871
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:53,219
I have no wish to see you

872
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,262
or your
friends harmed.

873
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:55,554
Give us the uplink,

874
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,474
or the only person
who will be harmed is you.

875
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:03,980
I thought you were
one of us.

876
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,400
Perhaps I was for a
time, but I believe

877
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,777
the Federation will survive
the Dominion, the Borg,

878
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,612
and people like you.

879
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:12,780
Mr. Worf...

880
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,324
if you walk out of here now,

881
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:16,034
you'll be turning your back
on the Federation.

882
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,369
Don't you see?

883
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:19,329
Overindulgence,
lack of self-control--

884
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:22,248
they'll destroy
everything we hold dear,

885
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,083
and you will be responsible.

886
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,502
You say that we have to return

887
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:27,086
to traditional
Federation values.

888
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,213
Well, I agree,

889
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:32,258
but one of those
values is trust.

890
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:37,055
It is essential that
we remember that.

891
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,516
Don't you walk away from<i> me.</i>

892
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:46,731
I will do as I please.

893
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:49,775
(<i> groaning</i> )

894
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:55,573
I am on vacation.

895
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:07,502
Figures-- the weather
improves the day we leave.

896
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:10,129
I can't wait
to get home.

897
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:13,132
Not that I didn't
enjoy myself.

898
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,468
I'd better
go find Bashir.

899
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:17,262
He brought a<i> Horga'hn</i>
down to breakfast,

900
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:18,555
and that's the last
I saw of him.

901
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:23,351
I hope the two of you
enjoyed Risa

902
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:24,769
and will come again.

903
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:27,605
I did not think that
I would be welcome.

904
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,647
Well, you still have

905
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:30,358
a lot to learn
about our people.

906
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:34,446
I never got a chance
to say good-bye to Curzon Dax.

907
00:43:34,446 --> 00:43:36,489
And you're not saying
good-bye to me either.

908
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:37,782
I'll be back.

909
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:42,495
And Risa will be waiting.

910
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:48,167
So, what do we do now?

911
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:51,712
Now we watch
the suns set.

912
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,965
I have a better idea.

913
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:56,134
Why don't we go swimming?

914
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:59,429
I... didn't bring
a bathing suit.

915
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:03,433
I won't tell if you don't.
