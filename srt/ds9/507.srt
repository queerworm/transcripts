1
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,042
So, what do you think
of the O'Briens' plan

2
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,142
to name their baby Sean?

3
00:00:25,185 --> 00:00:27,383
Well, I kind of like it.

4
00:00:27,424 --> 00:00:30,488
Sean... has a nice ring to it.

5
00:00:30,532 --> 00:00:33,334
Except that in Bajoran
<i>sean</i> means "swamp."

6
00:00:33,372 --> 00:00:35,069
Do the O'Briens know that?

7
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:36,601
I doubt it.

8
00:00:36,646 --> 00:00:38,206
Someone should tell them.

9
00:00:38,249 --> 00:00:40,014
I nominate you.

10
00:00:41,056 --> 00:00:42,959
Morning.

11
00:00:46,503 --> 00:00:47,938
Neck bothering you again?

12
00:00:47,973 --> 00:00:51,607
It's... it's just a muscle pull.

13
00:00:51,648 --> 00:00:52,947
What is that?

14
00:00:52,985 --> 00:00:55,890
The eighth muscle pull
this month?

15
00:00:55,925 --> 00:00:59,297
Actually, I believe
Commander Dax has been treated

16
00:00:59,334 --> 00:01:01,601
for seven muscle pulls

17
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:03,906
two contusions
and three cracked ribs.

18
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:06,415
The only person who's spent
more time in the Infirmary

19
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:09,983
over the past few weeks
is... Commander Worf.

20
00:01:10,026 --> 00:01:13,523
Isn't there any way the...
the two of you could, uh...

21
00:01:13,568 --> 00:01:15,265
uh, you know...

22
00:01:15,372 --> 00:01:16,671
Make love?

23
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:18,679
Without injuring yourselves?

24
00:01:18,713 --> 00:01:21,949
Interspecies romance
isn't without its danger.

25
00:01:21,988 --> 00:01:24,323
That's part of the fun.

26
00:01:26,332 --> 00:01:28,303
Maybe we'll have
better luck on Risa.

27
00:01:28,336 --> 00:01:29,635
Risa?

28
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,142
I thought you and Worf

29
00:01:31,176 --> 00:01:32,907
were taking your vacation
on Earth.

30
00:01:32,948 --> 00:01:35,146
That was his suggestion.

31
00:01:35,186 --> 00:01:36,587
I changed his mind.

32
00:01:36,623 --> 00:01:37,990
From what I hear

33
00:01:38,026 --> 00:01:42,697
Risa make the Hoobishan Baths
look like a monastery.

34
00:01:42,738 --> 00:01:44,766
I hope they have
a good hospital.

35
00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:48,684
I can't believe

36
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,091
you actually convinced Worf
to go to a pleasure planet.

37
00:01:52,127 --> 00:01:54,598
He must really be loosening up.

38
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:57,299
I hadn't noticed it.

39
00:01:57,339 --> 00:01:59,537
Come to think of it,
neither have I.

40
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,481
Oh, no, he's still
the same old Worf.

41
00:02:01,516 --> 00:02:03,145
Prune juice, extra large.

42
00:02:03,186 --> 00:02:04,951
See what I mean?

43
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:07,494
Worf.

44
00:02:11,373 --> 00:02:14,107
Captain, Constable...

45
00:02:14,147 --> 00:02:16,516
Commander.

46
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:19,788
Uh, Dax said...
you were going to Risa.

47
00:02:19,826 --> 00:02:21,318
Did she?

48
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,694
Well, it's no secret.

49
00:02:24,738 --> 00:02:26,105
Apparently not.

50
00:02:26,141 --> 00:02:28,112
You must be
looking forward to it.

51
00:02:28,146 --> 00:02:30,276
I'm looking forward
to spending some time alone

52
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:31,810
with Lieutenant Commander Dax.

53
00:02:31,855 --> 00:02:33,655
Isn't he sweet?

54
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:36,723
We have much to discuss.

55
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:37,826
About what?

56
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,738
It is a private matter.

57
00:02:39,774 --> 00:02:40,742
Oh.

58
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:42,007
Worf's upset

59
00:02:42,047 --> 00:02:43,984
because I had lunch
with Captain Boday.

60
00:02:44,018 --> 00:02:45,214
The Gallamite?

61
00:02:45,254 --> 00:02:47,555
His skull is transparent.

62
00:02:47,593 --> 00:02:49,062
And if you couldn't see
his brains

63
00:02:49,096 --> 00:02:50,429
would it make you
feel any better?

64
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:52,369
It is not proper
for you to have lunch

65
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,399
with an ex-lover
while we are together.

66
00:02:54,443 --> 00:02:56,937
We were just talking.

67
00:02:56,982 --> 00:02:58,953
You have to learn
to trust me a little more.

68
00:02:58,987 --> 00:03:00,752
I do trust you.

69
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:04,528
I do not trust Captain Boday.

70
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:06,401
Well...

71
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:09,777
I can see it's going to be
quite a trip.

72
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,953
Well, the two of you
have to tell us

73
00:03:12,987 --> 00:03:14,718
all about it when you get back.

74
00:03:14,758 --> 00:03:16,991
I am sure she will.

75
00:03:20,973 --> 00:03:23,537
I do not see why you
feel the need to talk

76
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,983
about our personal lives
to other people.

77
00:03:26,018 --> 00:03:27,453
And I don't see why
you feel the need

78
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:29,392
to control my every move.

79
00:03:29,427 --> 00:03:30,919
And they're not other people.

80
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:33,960
Benjamin and Odo are my friends.

81
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:35,667
Jadzia.

82
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:36,677
Hey.

83
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:37,679
Worf.

84
00:03:37,713 --> 00:03:38,841
We've been looking for you.

85
00:03:38,883 --> 00:03:40,477
Um, I've been thinking
about this trip

86
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,784
you're taking to Risa.

87
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:42,951
He's a friend, too.

88
00:03:42,993 --> 00:03:44,622
Julian and I
were talking it over

89
00:03:44,663 --> 00:03:46,497
and we'd like to come along...

90
00:03:46,535 --> 00:03:47,970
if that's all right.

91
00:03:48,907 --> 00:03:50,878
Actually, we were hoping

92
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,906
to spend some time
alone together.

93
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,249
Oh, you'll have it.

94
00:03:54,287 --> 00:03:56,758
Oh, once we get to Risa,
you won't even see us.

95
00:03:59,064 --> 00:04:01,764
There's no harm
in sharing a runabout.

96
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,875
I suppose not.

97
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,711
Oh!
Thank you so much!

98
00:04:06,749 --> 00:04:08,480
I'm going to go pack.

99
00:04:08,588 --> 00:04:09,887
Commander...

100
00:04:09,923 --> 00:04:11,222
Do not hug me.

101
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,994
I promise we'll keep
out of your hair.

102
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:15,502
Good.

103
00:04:15,537 --> 00:04:19,205
Because we have
much to discuss.

104
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,903
I really wish
I was going with you.

105
00:04:30,941 --> 00:04:34,039
Dax and I had
some great times on Risa.

106
00:04:36,253 --> 00:04:37,882
Curzon Dax.

107
00:04:37,925 --> 00:04:39,554
Curzon.

108
00:04:39,595 --> 00:04:40,928
Of course.

109
00:04:44,373 --> 00:04:45,535
Have fun.

110
00:04:50,454 --> 00:04:52,755
It's about time you got here.

111
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,595
The rest of us were ready
to leave an hour ago.

112
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,431
What is he doing here?

113
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,601
I've always wanted
to go to Risa

114
00:04:59,676 --> 00:05:01,111
and this seemed like
a perfect opportunity.

115
00:05:01,146 --> 00:05:02,274
He wouldn't
give me any time off

116
00:05:02,316 --> 00:05:03,751
unless we promised
to take him with us.

117
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:05,483
I hope this isn't
going to be a problem.

118
00:05:05,523 --> 00:05:07,824
Why should it be a problem?

119
00:05:07,862 --> 00:05:09,297
We're going to have
a wonderful time.

120
00:05:09,332 --> 00:05:12,100
Now, if you don't mind,
Risa awaits.

121
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,111
Sorry.

122
00:05:20,058 --> 00:05:21,550
Jadzia...

123
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:25,366
I know, I know.

124
00:05:25,405 --> 00:05:27,239
We have much to discuss.

125
00:07:36,345 --> 00:07:40,344
Let's see... that's
a Tarkalean tea for you

126
00:07:40,388 --> 00:07:42,586
a <i>raktajino</i> for you

127
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:44,495
and an extra large prune juice.

128
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,592
Leeta, you're on vacation,
not at Quark's.

129
00:07:46,636 --> 00:07:47,695
You don't have to serve us.

130
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:49,436
Oh, it gives me something to do.

131
00:07:49,476 --> 00:07:50,775
Space travel's so dull.

132
00:07:50,812 --> 00:07:53,580
Have you ever noticed
how all stars look the same?

133
00:07:53,619 --> 00:07:55,681
Excuse me...

134
00:07:55,724 --> 00:07:58,218
but I believe I ordered
a snail juice...

135
00:07:58,264 --> 00:07:59,254
hand-squeezed.

136
00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:00,427
Get it yourself.

137
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:01,631
I'm on vacation.

138
00:08:01,672 --> 00:08:03,643
How much longer
till we get there?

139
00:08:03,677 --> 00:08:05,545
Another six hours.

140
00:08:05,581 --> 00:08:07,141
Six hours?

141
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:09,383
Tell the Ferengi
to return to his cabin.

142
00:08:09,424 --> 00:08:11,018
You call that a cabin?

143
00:08:11,128 --> 00:08:13,565
It's a cot
and a waste disposal unit.

144
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,969
It's so small
even I can't stand up in there.

145
00:08:16,006 --> 00:08:18,170
Look... I'm developing a slouch.

146
00:08:18,212 --> 00:08:20,706
Tell the Ferengi
to return to his cabin now.

147
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,015
Quark...

148
00:08:22,054 --> 00:08:23,216
What's he going to do?

149
00:08:23,257 --> 00:08:24,783
Turn around and take me home?

150
00:08:24,828 --> 00:08:25,956
Ruin everyone's vacation?

151
00:08:25,996 --> 00:08:27,158
Coming about.

152
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,501
Setting course for Deep Space 9.

153
00:08:29,538 --> 00:08:31,372
Okay, okay.

154
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,936
You made your point.

155
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,574
I'm going.

156
00:08:34,617 --> 00:08:38,524
But first, I have
a little present for everyone.

157
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,086
One for you.

158
00:08:40,197 --> 00:08:43,261
And one for you.

159
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:46,768
And one for you.

160
00:08:46,814 --> 00:08:49,285
And none for you.

161
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:50,413
What's this?

162
00:08:50,456 --> 00:08:51,925
It's a <i>Horga'hn.</i>

163
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:55,126
A Risian fertility symbol.

164
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,430
Displaying one to the locals

165
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,774
indicates you're
seeking <i>jamaharon.</i>

166
00:08:59,812 --> 00:09:01,543
What's <i>jamaharon?</i>

167
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,180
I'll show you later.

168
00:09:05,357 --> 00:09:06,986
Oh.

169
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:09,091
Look.

170
00:09:09,134 --> 00:09:10,626
They like each other.

171
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,107
I think I'm going to be sick.

172
00:09:14,146 --> 00:09:16,276
All right. I'm going.

173
00:09:16,318 --> 00:09:18,482
Me, too.

174
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:21,956
Going? Where?

175
00:09:21,998 --> 00:09:24,800
I'm going to change
into something more comfortable.

176
00:09:24,838 --> 00:09:27,309
You don't think
I'm going to beam down to Risa

177
00:09:27,344 --> 00:09:29,007
dressed like this, do you?

178
00:09:30,552 --> 00:09:31,885
That's a good idea.

179
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:37,865
When in Rome...

180
00:10:05,034 --> 00:10:06,560
Oh!

181
00:10:06,604 --> 00:10:08,939
I can't believe
we finally made it.

182
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:14,150
Well, enjoy your vacation.

183
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,625
Mmm. We will.

184
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,998
Time to test these babies out.

185
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:21,232
Ladies...

186
00:10:23,545 --> 00:10:25,482
You seek <i>jamaharon?</i>

187
00:10:25,516 --> 00:10:28,284
I seek whatever you've got.

188
00:10:28,391 --> 00:10:30,885
All that is ours is yours.

189
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,673
I'll take it.

190
00:10:40,018 --> 00:10:42,489
Aren't you uncomfortable
in that uniform?

191
00:10:42,524 --> 00:10:45,224
Starfleet uniforms
are designed for comfort

192
00:10:45,264 --> 00:10:47,828
even in the most
extreme environments.

193
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,841
Well, you look out of place.

194
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,675
I mean, look around you.

195
00:10:51,712 --> 00:10:53,079
Isn't it beautiful?

196
00:10:53,116 --> 00:10:55,178
It is an artificially
created paradise

197
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:58,194
maintained by the most elaborate
weather control system

198
00:10:58,228 --> 00:10:59,527
in the Federation.

199
00:10:59,565 --> 00:11:01,866
In its natural state,
Risa is nothing more

200
00:11:01,903 --> 00:11:04,535
than a rain-soaked,
geologically unstable jungle.

201
00:11:04,577 --> 00:11:05,876
Maybe so

202
00:11:05,913 --> 00:11:08,886
but the only dark cloud
I see around here is you.

203
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,221
I did not come here
to admire the scenery.

204
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:13,162
If you say so.

205
00:11:13,197 --> 00:11:15,168
I guess we should just go home.

206
00:11:15,202 --> 00:11:17,173
Well, maybe...

207
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:21,444
I would not be so hasty.

208
00:11:21,484 --> 00:11:23,785
I take it
the scenery has improved.

209
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:27,027
A few months ago

210
00:11:27,064 --> 00:11:28,864
when I was commanding
the <i>Defiant</i>

211
00:11:28,902 --> 00:11:31,203
on a scouting mission
in the Gamma Quadrant

212
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,040
we encountered
a protostar cluster...

213
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:36,883
a swirling mass of color,
set against a background

214
00:11:36,921 --> 00:11:39,222
of glowing clouds
and burning sky.

215
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:43,396
It was the most beautiful thing
I'd ever seen...

216
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,270
until now.

217
00:11:47,446 --> 00:11:50,647
I've got to take you
on vacation more often.

218
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,363
Dax, is that you?

219
00:11:56,234 --> 00:11:57,293
Arandis.

220
00:11:57,337 --> 00:11:59,433
I was wondering
if you were still here.

221
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:01,273
Oh!

222
00:12:01,312 --> 00:12:03,715
Not only am I still here,
I have been promoted.

223
00:12:03,752 --> 00:12:06,850
I'm Chief Facilitator for
the entire Temtibi Lagoon.

224
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,831
Worf, this is Arandis.

225
00:12:09,866 --> 00:12:10,994
A friend of Curzon's.

226
00:12:11,036 --> 00:12:13,064
She and Curzon spent
a lot of time together

227
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:14,839
on his last trip here.

228
00:12:14,878 --> 00:12:16,974
We had a wonderful time
together...

229
00:12:17,017 --> 00:12:18,418
until I killed him.

230
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:19,615
Killed him?!

231
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:22,221
Death by <i>jamaharon.</i>

232
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:24,757
I suppose there
are worse ways to go.

233
00:12:24,802 --> 00:12:27,434
Trust me, he died happy.

234
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:29,946
He was such a sweet old man.

235
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,953
I will take your word for it.

236
00:12:33,624 --> 00:12:35,287
It's so good
to see you again, Dax.

237
00:12:35,328 --> 00:12:37,663
Your new host
is very attractive.

238
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,668
Thank you.

239
00:12:38,703 --> 00:12:39,671
I'd like to think so.

240
00:12:39,705 --> 00:12:41,140
You haven't aged a day.

241
00:12:41,175 --> 00:12:43,704
Ah... Risa's
been very kind to me.

242
00:12:43,748 --> 00:12:45,411
Come, let me show you around.

243
00:12:45,452 --> 00:12:46,819
Maybe later.

244
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:49,957
Of course.

245
00:12:49,995 --> 00:12:52,091
All that is ours is yours.

246
00:12:52,134 --> 00:12:53,102
Thank you.

247
00:12:53,137 --> 00:12:55,005
But we have everything we need.

248
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:04,860
That wasn't very nice.

249
00:13:04,898 --> 00:13:07,301
Why? Is there something
of hers you want?

250
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:10,140
Arandis was Curzon's lover,
not mine.

251
00:13:10,178 --> 00:13:12,081
I hope you remember that.

252
00:13:12,115 --> 00:13:14,609
You're still angry
about Captain Boday.

253
00:13:14,655 --> 00:13:16,592
If I am angry, it is because

254
00:13:16,627 --> 00:13:19,657
you do not take
our relationship seriously.

255
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,794
Worf, we just got here.

256
00:13:20,837 --> 00:13:22,705
Do we have
to start arguing again?

257
00:13:22,741 --> 00:13:26,512
If you were a Klingon woman,
we would already be married.

258
00:13:26,617 --> 00:13:29,111
In case you haven't noticed,
I am not a Klingon woman.

259
00:13:29,156 --> 00:13:31,093
That is no excuse.

260
00:13:31,128 --> 00:13:34,329
I have been loyal to you
and I expect you to be loyal

261
00:13:34,369 --> 00:13:35,736
to me in return.

262
00:13:35,772 --> 00:13:37,173
I have been loyal to you

263
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:39,373
but I'm not going
to let you run my life.

264
00:13:39,415 --> 00:13:41,318
I'm not trying to run your life.

265
00:13:41,352 --> 00:13:42,719
Then I'm going to go

266
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,885
and have a big glass
of icoberry juice.

267
00:13:44,927 --> 00:13:46,396
That is a mistake.

268
00:13:46,431 --> 00:13:48,902
You are allergic
to icoberry juice.

269
00:13:48,937 --> 00:13:50,566
It makes your...

270
00:13:50,608 --> 00:13:52,077
spots itch.

271
00:13:52,111 --> 00:13:53,740
But I like the taste.

272
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:57,245
Fine. Have as much
icoberry juice as you like

273
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,091
but it is still a mistake.

274
00:13:59,128 --> 00:14:01,258
But it is my mistake to make.

275
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,771
Now, why don't you
go up to our room

276
00:14:03,806 --> 00:14:07,645
and put on your bathing suit
so we can swim in the lagoon?

277
00:14:11,157 --> 00:14:12,421
As you wish.

278
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,170
Enter.

279
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:25,921
I hope I'm not disturbing you,
Lieutenant Commander.

280
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,124
My name is
Pascal Fullerton.

281
00:14:28,165 --> 00:14:30,568
I'm the chairman of the
New Essentialists Movement.

282
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:32,768
I'm not familiar
with that organization.

283
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,369
We're dedicated to restoring

284
00:14:34,412 --> 00:14:37,351
the moral and cultural
traditions of the Federation.

285
00:14:37,387 --> 00:14:40,360
This is a statement
of our principles.

286
00:14:40,394 --> 00:14:41,920
But if you would
like to hear more

287
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,197
we're holding a rally
later this afternoon.

288
00:14:44,236 --> 00:14:45,295
On Risa?

289
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:46,808
What better place?

290
00:14:46,843 --> 00:14:49,816
This world revels in the kind
of self-indulgence

291
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,154
that's eroding the foundations
of Federation society.

292
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:54,985
We intend to shut it down.

293
00:15:07,815 --> 00:15:10,379
I really wish you'd
stop reading that.

294
00:15:10,421 --> 00:15:12,915
I would not dismiss
Fullerton so quickly.

295
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,431
His analysis
of recent Federation history

296
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:17,232
is both insightful
and disturbing.

297
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:18,603
What's really disturbing

298
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,009
is that you're still
wearing your uniform.

299
00:15:21,047 --> 00:15:23,645
It would not hurt you
to read this.

300
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,186
Mmm...

301
00:15:28,197 --> 00:15:29,928
mmm!

302
00:15:29,968 --> 00:15:32,497
Well, the truth is

303
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,842
not everyone can be a dabo girl.

304
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,281
First of all

305
00:15:36,383 --> 00:15:38,547
you have to be able
to wear the clothes

306
00:15:38,588 --> 00:15:41,186
and believe me, that's not easy.

307
00:15:41,228 --> 00:15:42,857
You have to be able

308
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:45,736
to calculate odds in
your head very quickly

309
00:15:45,772 --> 00:15:47,298
and most importantly

310
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,881
you need a very supple wrist...

311
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,681
like this.

312
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:55,160
Dabo.

313
00:15:55,195 --> 00:15:56,960
...the end of the Federation

314
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,662
since the day it was founded.

315
00:15:58,703 --> 00:15:59,899
Trust me. I know.

316
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,873
Oh, hi!

317
00:16:00,908 --> 00:16:02,879
Leeta, what a surprise.

318
00:16:02,913 --> 00:16:04,075
Care to join us?

319
00:16:04,116 --> 00:16:05,984
We were just about
to take a reyamilk soak.

320
00:16:07,023 --> 00:16:08,686
Maybe later.

321
00:16:08,727 --> 00:16:12,361
Worf.
Worf.

322
00:16:17,782 --> 00:16:20,755
That was not Dr. Bashir.

323
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:23,022
It's none of our business.

324
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:25,089
Are you defending
her actions?

325
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:26,762
I am not defending anything

326
00:16:26,804 --> 00:16:28,775
but it's not my business
or yours.

327
00:16:28,808 --> 00:16:30,836
Now, what do you say
we go sign out

328
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,512
a couple of floaters
and take in the sights?

329
00:16:33,553 --> 00:16:34,681
I cannot.

330
00:16:34,723 --> 00:16:36,352
The Essentialists
are having a rally

331
00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:37,693
and I plan to attend.

332
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,222
You're kidding.

333
00:16:41,406 --> 00:16:43,206
You're not kidding.

334
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,004
Don't these people have
anything better to do?

335
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,737
Perhaps you underestimate

336
00:16:57,778 --> 00:17:00,307
the power of
Fullerton's message.

337
00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:02,185
The plot thickens.

338
00:17:03,859 --> 00:17:07,356
And you were worried
about Julian.

339
00:17:08,671 --> 00:17:11,644
Why are he and Leeta
not together?

340
00:17:11,678 --> 00:17:14,742
I don't know, but don't
jump to conclusions.

341
00:17:14,786 --> 00:17:17,384
I'm sure there's
a reasonable explanation.

342
00:17:17,425 --> 00:17:20,091
This place is
a bad influence on people.

343
00:17:20,132 --> 00:17:22,069
Here for the show?

344
00:17:22,103 --> 00:17:24,370
I would not call it a show.

345
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:27,645
Really? I find Mr. Fullerton
very entertaining.

346
00:17:27,683 --> 00:17:29,586
He seems pretty determined

347
00:17:29,621 --> 00:17:32,150
to discourage people
from coming here.

348
00:17:32,194 --> 00:17:34,188
Risa receives millions
of visitors every year.

349
00:17:34,232 --> 00:17:36,703
And all of them leave happier
than when they've arrived.

350
00:17:36,738 --> 00:17:37,797
I don't see how one man

351
00:17:37,841 --> 00:17:39,709
no matter how determined,
can change that.

352
00:17:39,746 --> 00:17:42,548
Kahless fought off an entire
army at Three Turn Bridge

353
00:17:42,586 --> 00:17:44,112
and he was only one man.

354
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:45,625
Fullerton
and his Essentialists

355
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,993
have been here for about a month

356
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,967
and no matter
how many speeches he gives

357
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:53,034
the water's still warm,
and the wind still smells sweet.

358
00:17:53,077 --> 00:17:56,315
But, if he's enjoying himself,
who are we to discourage him?

359
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:06,304
That's right.

360
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:07,968
Take a good look.

361
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:11,415
I can only imagine
what you must think of me...

362
00:18:11,451 --> 00:18:13,422
a middle-aged,
ponderous academic

363
00:18:13,456 --> 00:18:15,689
sweating under
the hot Risian suns

364
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:18,326
wasting his time
telling you things

365
00:18:18,368 --> 00:18:20,737
you don't want to hear.

366
00:18:20,773 --> 00:18:24,236
But you know what I see
when I look at you?

367
00:18:24,282 --> 00:18:25,774
Children...

368
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:29,123
pampered, spoiled children.

369
00:18:29,194 --> 00:18:32,395
For some reason, the
citizens of the Federation

370
00:18:32,434 --> 00:18:33,528
have come to believe

371
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,804
that they are entitled
to lives of ease...

372
00:18:35,843 --> 00:18:36,811
I may be wrong

373
00:18:36,845 --> 00:18:38,109
but didn't he just insult us?

374
00:18:38,148 --> 00:18:41,315
If you want something to eat,
you get it from a replicator.

375
00:18:41,356 --> 00:18:44,990
If you want amusement,
you go to a holosuite

376
00:18:45,031 --> 00:18:49,771
and if you need protection,
you call for Starfleet.

377
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,838
But someday...

378
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,510
someday soon

379
00:18:53,552 --> 00:18:56,958
you're going to have to learn
to take care of yourselves

380
00:18:56,994 --> 00:18:59,694
because if I see you
as helpless children

381
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:02,136
then how do you think
the Borg see you?

382
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:05,873
Or the Romulans or the Klingons
or the Dominion?

383
00:19:05,915 --> 00:19:08,547
These empires look
at the Federation

384
00:19:08,588 --> 00:19:10,752
and they see a prize...

385
00:19:10,793 --> 00:19:13,664
a prize that we have
forgotten how to protect

386
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,171
and if we don't change our ways

387
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:18,506
they're going to take it
from us.

388
00:19:18,545 --> 00:19:21,815
Mr. Fullerton has quite
a flair for the dramatic.

389
00:19:21,852 --> 00:19:24,416
Does he really believe that?

390
00:19:24,459 --> 00:19:25,792
I think he does.

391
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:27,162
...and re-embrace

392
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,862
the kind of hard work

393
00:19:28,903 --> 00:19:31,876
that built the Federation
in the first place.

394
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:34,542
Or we can lie here
napping in the sun

395
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,679
until we wake up

396
00:19:36,722 --> 00:19:40,994
with Jem'Hadar guns
to our heads.

397
00:19:41,032 --> 00:19:44,632
The choice is ours.

398
00:19:44,674 --> 00:19:47,545
Heaven help us
if we make the wrong one.

399
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:53,487
What are you talking about?

400
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:55,557
Come on, Worf, this sounds
like nonsense.

401
00:19:55,601 --> 00:19:56,900
I am merely observing

402
00:19:56,936 --> 00:19:58,599
that the Klingons would
never have attacked

403
00:19:58,641 --> 00:20:01,135
had they not believed
the Federation vulnerable.

404
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,740
Even now, since the changeling

405
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,482
was discovered on the
Klingon High Council

406
00:20:04,522 --> 00:20:06,891
most of my people
continue to call for war

407
00:20:06,927 --> 00:20:09,194
because they think
they can win.

408
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:11,704
None of this has
anything to do with Risa.

409
00:20:11,739 --> 00:20:13,208
You cannot be certain of that.

410
00:20:13,242 --> 00:20:14,506
All I know is

411
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,676
I've spent lifetimes
defending the Federation

412
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:19,623
and I deserve a vacation
every now and then.

413
00:20:21,028 --> 00:20:21,996
Julian?

414
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:25,170
Oh, there you are.

415
00:20:25,205 --> 00:20:26,936
I am so glad we came here.

416
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,276
I'm having
the most wonderful time.

417
00:20:29,315 --> 00:20:31,445
I told you this was
just what we needed.

418
00:20:31,487 --> 00:20:32,477
Mmm...

419
00:20:34,727 --> 00:20:36,162
Something wrong?

420
00:20:36,197 --> 00:20:37,928
It's nothing.

421
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:41,239
You two dishonor each other
with your actions.

422
00:20:41,276 --> 00:20:43,679
Do you know
what he's talking about?

423
00:20:43,716 --> 00:20:48,422
You mean... we didn't tell you
why we came here?

424
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,267
We're conducting
the Rite of Separation.

425
00:20:52,303 --> 00:20:54,137
It's an old Bajoran custom.

426
00:20:54,174 --> 00:20:55,939
When a couple separates

427
00:20:55,978 --> 00:20:58,211
they spend several days
celebrating their parting.

428
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,280
It's a way to remember
all the good times

429
00:21:01,324 --> 00:21:04,787
and to seek out
new opportunities.

430
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,965
A very wise and ancient culture.

431
00:21:08,007 --> 00:21:11,607
You know, Julian,
I don't think

432
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:14,178
I've completely gotten you
out of my system yet.

433
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:16,659
I know exactly what you mean.

434
00:21:16,695 --> 00:21:18,529
Excuse us.

435
00:21:18,565 --> 00:21:22,769
Um, we have a few...
details to work out.

436
00:21:29,224 --> 00:21:30,955
Terminating a relationship

437
00:21:30,996 --> 00:21:33,194
should not be taken
so frivolously.

438
00:21:33,234 --> 00:21:34,760
Not every relationship

439
00:21:34,804 --> 00:21:36,775
has to end like
a Klingon opera.

440
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:38,278
Oh, no, no.

441
00:21:38,313 --> 00:21:40,284
Just the ones that
are important.

442
00:21:45,363 --> 00:21:47,026
Stay where you are.

443
00:22:01,836 --> 00:22:03,396
On three.

444
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,875
One, two...

445
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:05,969
Wait.

446
00:22:06,013 --> 00:22:07,676
That's enough.

447
00:22:08,987 --> 00:22:13,327
Well... I hope
we've proved our point.

448
00:22:15,268 --> 00:22:17,296
The power cells are empty.

449
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,641
We have no intention
of harming anyone.

450
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,014
I don't understand.

451
00:22:22,051 --> 00:22:25,355
You think you're safe here
in this "paradise" of yours

452
00:22:25,393 --> 00:22:26,692
but you're not.

453
00:22:26,729 --> 00:22:28,700
What if we had been Jem'Hadar

454
00:22:28,734 --> 00:22:30,932
or Klingons or Romulans.

455
00:22:30,973 --> 00:22:32,306
Hmm?

456
00:22:32,343 --> 00:22:34,337
You'd be dead now.

457
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,874
Even you... Starfleet officers...

458
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,859
were lulled into a false
sense of security.

459
00:22:39,894 --> 00:22:42,297
If you could be taken unaware

460
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:45,306
what chance
do the rest of us have?

461
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,675
The sad truth is

462
00:22:47,712 --> 00:22:50,708
the galaxy is a hostile place.

463
00:22:50,753 --> 00:22:55,788
Forget that, even for a moment,
and you risk losing everything.

464
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,666
Just something for you

465
00:22:57,703 --> 00:23:01,269
to think about while you wait
for your desserts.

466
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,772
All right.

467
00:23:03,818 --> 00:23:04,912
Come on, demonstration's over.

468
00:23:04,954 --> 00:23:06,116
Move along, move along.

469
00:23:06,157 --> 00:23:08,526
As a Starfleet officer,
I have the authority

470
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,624
to arrest you
for what you just did.

471
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:12,638
But that would be
a waste of time.

472
00:23:12,672 --> 00:23:15,075
We both know the Risians
won't prosecute.

473
00:23:15,111 --> 00:23:17,207
They don't have
the courage for it.

474
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,278
Believe me, I wish they did.

475
00:23:19,321 --> 00:23:20,688
Commander Worf...

476
00:23:20,725 --> 00:23:24,131
what did you think of
our little demonstration?

477
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:27,140
I cannot condone
what you have done.

478
00:23:27,174 --> 00:23:28,507
Maybe not...

479
00:23:28,544 --> 00:23:30,742
but I do think
you understand it.

480
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:55,231
I don't know about you,
but it's past my bedtime.

481
00:23:57,012 --> 00:23:58,641
We need to talk.

482
00:23:58,682 --> 00:24:01,153
About the Essentialists?

483
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,456
No. About us.

484
00:24:03,494 --> 00:24:07,630
Oh, I suppose you have another
list of things I'm doing wrong.

485
00:24:08,706 --> 00:24:10,802
I did not say you were
doing anything wrong.

486
00:24:10,845 --> 00:24:11,973
It's just that...

487
00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:14,282
some of your behavior...

488
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,949
What about my behavior?

489
00:24:15,991 --> 00:24:18,428
At times, you are too impulsive.

490
00:24:18,463 --> 00:24:20,457
You-you act without thinking.

491
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:22,096
You have no self-control.

492
00:24:22,139 --> 00:24:24,703
And you think
I need you to control me?

493
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:29,018
Jadzia, you are my <i>par'machkai</i>

494
00:24:29,056 --> 00:24:32,326
and that means everything
you do reflects on me.

495
00:24:32,363 --> 00:24:34,334
I'm sorry if I embarrass you.

496
00:24:34,368 --> 00:24:38,367
I just need to know
that you take this relationship

497
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:40,040
as seriously as I do.

498
00:24:40,082 --> 00:24:42,680
And I just wish
you'd relax a little

499
00:24:42,788 --> 00:24:45,818
and let yourself enjoy
what we have together.

500
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:54,205
Worf, I'm not going
to change who I am.

501
00:24:54,249 --> 00:24:56,447
Nor am I.

502
00:24:56,488 --> 00:24:59,792
Well, at least we agree
on something.

503
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,581
Why don't we go to bed?

504
00:25:07,615 --> 00:25:09,415
You go.

505
00:25:09,452 --> 00:25:12,084
I will be there shortly.

506
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,098
This place looks a lot better
than it did last night.

507
00:25:30,135 --> 00:25:32,470
I guess the Risians
aren't as lethargic

508
00:25:32,508 --> 00:25:34,979
as the Essentialists would
like everyone to believe.

509
00:25:35,013 --> 00:25:37,952
The Essentialists are
wrong about many things.

510
00:25:37,987 --> 00:25:42,117
What Mr. Fullerton could use
is a little <i>jamaharon.</i>

511
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,446
No...

512
00:25:43,487 --> 00:25:45,150
a lot of <i>jamaharon.</i>

513
00:25:47,362 --> 00:25:50,996
I'd buy him a <i>Horga'hn</i> myself
if I thought he'd take it.

514
00:25:53,979 --> 00:25:55,539
It looks like
he's not the only one

515
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:57,109
that could use some cheering up.

516
00:25:57,153 --> 00:25:59,556
I've had better vacations.

517
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,127
Better than Risa?

518
00:26:03,602 --> 00:26:05,505
I've never known a Klingon

519
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,377
who had a tougher time
enjoying himself.

520
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:10,850
That's no reason for you
not to have a good time.

521
00:26:10,885 --> 00:26:14,189
Risa is famous
for its diversions.

522
00:26:14,227 --> 00:26:17,359
I wish it were that simple.

523
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:19,201
It was for Curzon Dax.

524
00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:20,207
Yeah.

525
00:26:20,241 --> 00:26:21,540
And I can tell

526
00:26:21,578 --> 00:26:24,210
there's more
than a little Curzon in you.

527
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:27,156
He loved this planet.

528
00:26:27,191 --> 00:26:29,094
And Risa loved him.

529
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:33,499
Why don't I help you clean up?

530
00:26:35,612 --> 00:26:37,913
All that is ours is yours.

531
00:26:39,922 --> 00:26:42,359
Our paths have grown apart.

532
00:26:49,846 --> 00:26:52,546
What was one is now two.

533
00:26:54,891 --> 00:26:58,730
The time for sharing
is over.

534
00:27:03,746 --> 00:27:05,580
May the Prophets guide you

535
00:27:05,684 --> 00:27:07,678
toward the path of happiness.

536
00:27:07,722 --> 00:27:11,219
And may they walk
with you always.

537
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:25,527
That's it?

538
00:27:25,565 --> 00:27:26,864
That's it.

539
00:27:26,901 --> 00:27:28,530
What were you expecting?

540
00:27:28,572 --> 00:27:30,770
I was expecting fireworks.

541
00:27:30,811 --> 00:27:32,041
Where's the anger?

542
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,743
The vicious name-calling?

543
00:27:33,784 --> 00:27:35,652
The irrational accusations?

544
00:27:35,689 --> 00:27:38,253
I never would have agreed
to be a witness

545
00:27:38,295 --> 00:27:40,927
if I'd known you were going
to be so civil.

546
00:27:40,968 --> 00:27:42,096
It's disgusting.

547
00:27:42,138 --> 00:27:44,234
Personally, I think
it was admirable...

548
00:27:44,276 --> 00:27:46,338
no recriminations,
no hurt feelings.

549
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:48,682
I don't think I've
ever felt this good

550
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,623
about the end
of a relationship.

551
00:27:50,658 --> 00:27:51,888
Oh, I agree.

552
00:27:51,927 --> 00:27:54,194
Now I can finally be honest
about my feelings.

553
00:27:54,234 --> 00:27:56,603
What... does that mean?

554
00:27:56,639 --> 00:27:59,441
It's just...

555
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:01,643
in the past few months

556
00:28:01,751 --> 00:28:06,285
I've been... thinking a lot
about another man.

557
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:07,662
Ahh...

558
00:28:07,766 --> 00:28:09,326
Let me get this straight.

559
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:11,466
While you were still
dating Julian here

560
00:28:11,508 --> 00:28:14,002
you were having fantasies
about someone else?

561
00:28:14,047 --> 00:28:15,984
I'd rather not discuss it now.

562
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:17,318
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You brought it up.

563
00:28:17,355 --> 00:28:19,383
You might as well
tell me who it is.

564
00:28:19,427 --> 00:28:20,828
Yes, do tell.

565
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,863
It's...

566
00:28:26,143 --> 00:28:28,114
Me?

567
00:28:28,148 --> 00:28:30,016
Your brother...

568
00:28:30,053 --> 00:28:31,522
Rom.

569
00:28:31,556 --> 00:28:33,857
My brother Rom?

570
00:28:33,895 --> 00:28:35,228
His brother Rom?

571
00:28:35,265 --> 00:28:37,361
He's so cute...

572
00:28:37,403 --> 00:28:39,704
and very sexy.

573
00:28:39,742 --> 00:28:41,542
"Cute"?

574
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,209
"Sexy"?

575
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,084
- Rom?
- Rom?

576
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:47,490
Here.

577
00:28:47,527 --> 00:28:49,691
You need this more than I do.

578
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,164
Just close your eyes
and watch your body.

579
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:10,147
Let all the tension drain away.

580
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,483
Doesn't the clay feel good?

581
00:29:12,521 --> 00:29:14,321
Wonderful.

582
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:17,595
Now pour your emotions
into it.

583
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:19,262
Begin to mold it.

584
00:29:19,304 --> 00:29:21,400
Feel the texture in your hands.

585
00:29:21,443 --> 00:29:23,003
I do.

586
00:29:23,046 --> 00:29:25,347
I feel it.
I really do.

587
00:29:25,385 --> 00:29:27,788
I knew you'd get it.

588
00:29:27,824 --> 00:29:29,795
Dax.

589
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:31,763
Worf!

590
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:37,606
Worf?

591
00:30:03,042 --> 00:30:05,013
I'm tired of giving speeches.

592
00:30:05,047 --> 00:30:06,607
It's time we took action.

593
00:30:06,651 --> 00:30:09,122
We've taken action...
the raid on the solarium.

594
00:30:09,156 --> 00:30:11,093
It'll be forgotten
by tomorrow.

595
00:30:14,068 --> 00:30:16,096
Mr. Worf?

596
00:30:20,015 --> 00:30:22,749
You want to make
people leave Risa...

597
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:24,953
I think I know a way.

598
00:30:34,575 --> 00:30:37,069
I probably would have reacted
the same way Worf did.

599
00:30:37,114 --> 00:30:39,916
I mean, I know Arandis is
Curzon's lover, not yours

600
00:30:39,954 --> 00:30:42,552
but if I'd walked in on the two
of you together, well...

601
00:30:42,627 --> 00:30:45,464
trying to figure you out
at any given time isn't easy.

602
00:30:45,501 --> 00:30:46,902
I like that about her.

603
00:30:46,937 --> 00:30:48,133
So do I.

604
00:30:48,174 --> 00:30:49,905
It's the reason why I
chased after her so long.

605
00:30:49,944 --> 00:30:51,573
Would you two please

606
00:30:51,682 --> 00:30:54,051
stop talking about me
like I'm not here.

607
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:56,754
It's also the reason why I
stopped chasing after her.

608
00:30:56,795 --> 00:30:58,264
You're too much work.

609
00:30:58,298 --> 00:31:00,496
Worf is the one
who's too much work.

610
00:31:00,537 --> 00:31:03,442
What you need is a Ferengi.

611
00:31:03,477 --> 00:31:04,776
Maybe

612
00:31:04,814 --> 00:31:07,787
but what I want is Worf.

613
00:31:07,821 --> 00:31:09,188
Why?

614
00:31:09,224 --> 00:31:13,667
Because he has the courage
of a berserker cat

615
00:31:13,702 --> 00:31:16,436
and he has the heart of a poet.

616
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:18,571
And the brain
of a pigheaded idiot.

617
00:31:18,613 --> 00:31:20,982
Yeah, sometimes.

618
00:31:22,122 --> 00:31:23,591
Jadzia.

619
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:24,593
Any luck?

620
00:31:24,661 --> 00:31:25,960
I'm afraid not.

621
00:31:25,998 --> 00:31:27,490
None of the staff can find him

622
00:31:27,535 --> 00:31:28,936
but I'm sure he'll turn up.

623
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:31,843
Well, no sense
waiting around here for him.

624
00:31:31,879 --> 00:31:34,043
I say we take some floaters
up into the hills

625
00:31:34,084 --> 00:31:36,613
and go skinny-dipping
in the hot springs.

626
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:37,954
I never thought I'd say this

627
00:31:37,993 --> 00:31:39,292
but I'm with Quark.

628
00:31:39,329 --> 00:31:41,197
What was that?

629
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:43,432
Great. Just what we needed.

630
00:31:43,473 --> 00:31:45,033
I thought it wasn't
supposed to rain

631
00:31:45,076 --> 00:31:46,044
in this part of Risa.

632
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:47,879
It's not.

633
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:50,115
Something must be wrong
with the weather grid.

634
00:32:00,881 --> 00:32:03,011
May I have your attention,
please.

635
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:05,525
Obviously, the weather grid
is experiencing

636
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:07,188
some type of malfunction

637
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:10,203
but I'm sure we'll be able
to repair it soon.

638
00:32:10,238 --> 00:32:11,206
No...

639
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,834
you won't.

640
00:32:12,876 --> 00:32:14,607
You're responsible for this.

641
00:32:14,648 --> 00:32:17,382
Oh, I authorized it,
but it was not my idea.

642
00:32:17,421 --> 00:32:18,754
It was mine.

643
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:20,785
Are you serious?

644
00:32:20,829 --> 00:32:22,663
He's serious.

645
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:24,829
Worf, what did you do,
build an uplink

646
00:32:24,872 --> 00:32:27,470
so you could take control
of the weather grid?

647
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:28,811
The grid has been deactivated.

648
00:32:28,849 --> 00:32:31,583
It will take three or four days
to restore the system

649
00:32:31,621 --> 00:32:33,022
to normal operation.

650
00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:34,858
During that time,
the inhabitants of Risa

651
00:32:34,896 --> 00:32:36,627
and their guests will experience

652
00:32:36,668 --> 00:32:38,935
the planet's
natural weather cycle.

653
00:32:38,973 --> 00:32:40,135
And for most on Risa

654
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:42,146
that means rain,
and plenty of it.

655
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,549
But why are you doing this?

656
00:32:44,586 --> 00:32:46,249
Because Risa is an illusion

657
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,523
created
by weather control systems

658
00:32:48,562 --> 00:32:51,433
industrial replicators,
seismic regulators.

659
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,271
If the Federation
is going to survive

660
00:32:54,309 --> 00:32:57,180
we're going to have to stop
wasting our time with toys

661
00:32:57,216 --> 00:32:59,278
and get back to the essentials.

662
00:33:01,761 --> 00:33:04,427
I'm beginning to think
there's no hope for that man.

663
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:08,703
Or for you, either, Mr. Worf.

664
00:33:13,522 --> 00:33:15,720
Commander,
with all due respect

665
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:17,662
are you out of your mind?

666
00:33:17,699 --> 00:33:20,170
Oh, I think you will find me
quite rational.

667
00:33:20,204 --> 00:33:22,266
As rational
as Klingons get, anyway.

668
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:23,744
Worf, this is wrong.

669
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,113
I disagree.

670
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:28,556
If Federation citizens cannot
handle a little bad weather

671
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:31,621
how will they handle
a Dominion invasion?

672
00:33:46,668 --> 00:33:50,074
I have seen drier days
on Ferenginar

673
00:33:50,109 --> 00:33:54,051
and we have 178
different words for rain.

674
00:33:54,086 --> 00:33:57,618
Right now,
it's <i>glebbening</i> out there

675
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:59,130
and that's bad.

676
00:33:59,165 --> 00:34:02,731
If you're so miserable,
why don't you take your <i>Horga'hn</i>

677
00:34:02,773 --> 00:34:04,037
and go find some company?

678
00:34:04,077 --> 00:34:07,107
Have you taken a good look
at the Risians lately?

679
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:09,451
They're even more depressed
than the guests.

680
00:34:10,993 --> 00:34:14,023
I'm trying to organize
a game of hoverball.

681
00:34:14,067 --> 00:34:15,696
Would either of you
like to join us?

682
00:34:15,738 --> 00:34:16,706
In the rain?

683
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,007
No, on one of the indoor courts.

684
00:34:19,046 --> 00:34:20,743
Indoor hoverball.

685
00:34:20,783 --> 00:34:23,084
That's just wrong.

686
00:34:23,122 --> 00:34:24,352
I'll play.

687
00:34:24,392 --> 00:34:27,024
Good.
That makes one.

688
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,033
Having trouble

689
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:29,434
keeping the guests happy?

690
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:31,839
I've never heard
so much complaining in my life.

691
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:34,177
Nobody came here
to sit around in the rain.

692
00:34:34,215 --> 00:34:35,946
It's not just the weather.

693
00:34:35,986 --> 00:34:38,857
People are starting
to complain about everything...

694
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:41,126
the rooms, the entertainment,
the food.

695
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:43,433
What's wrong with the food?

696
00:34:43,471 --> 00:34:45,031
Nothing, as far as I can tell

697
00:34:45,075 --> 00:34:48,071
but the guests say
it just doesn't taste right.

698
00:34:48,115 --> 00:34:49,709
It's the humidity.

699
00:34:49,753 --> 00:34:53,057
It dampens the food,
makes everything mushy.

700
00:34:53,094 --> 00:34:57,264
Trust me. There's no word
for "crisp" on Ferenginar.

701
00:34:57,304 --> 00:35:00,175
Maybe Mr. Fullerton was right.

702
00:35:00,211 --> 00:35:03,708
Maybe we have forgotten
how to deal with adversity.

703
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,602
According to our figures.
The guest population

704
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,704
has declined by 30 percent
in the last three days.

705
00:35:10,749 --> 00:35:13,152
And you can be sure
the guests that have stayed

706
00:35:13,187 --> 00:35:15,090
are taking what you
have to say seriously.

707
00:35:15,126 --> 00:35:16,390
It's a start.

708
00:35:16,429 --> 00:35:18,160
One that you can build on.

709
00:35:20,606 --> 00:35:21,734
You're leaving?

710
00:35:23,846 --> 00:35:26,375
I have had my fill of Risa.

711
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,621
Mr. Worf, you've been
an inspiration to us all.

712
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,152
Good luck.

713
00:35:31,198 --> 00:35:32,394
Thank you.

714
00:35:34,004 --> 00:35:37,171
You still have the uplink
to the weather control grid?

715
00:35:37,212 --> 00:35:38,841
Right here.

716
00:35:38,882 --> 00:35:42,687
By tomorrow, the weather grid
will be restored to normal

717
00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:46,222
and no one here will remember
this ever happened.

718
00:35:48,906 --> 00:35:51,640
But I intend to send a message

719
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,913
they won't forget.

720
00:36:04,711 --> 00:36:06,944
You must be feeling
pretty good right now.

721
00:36:06,984 --> 00:36:09,855
The weather's terrible,
the guests are miserable

722
00:36:09,891 --> 00:36:12,659
and more and more people
are leaving Risa every day.

723
00:36:12,697 --> 00:36:15,100
Their response
only proves my point.

724
00:36:15,136 --> 00:36:16,696
Oh, I see.

725
00:36:16,806 --> 00:36:20,542
Ruin the vacations
of a few hundred thousand people

726
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:24,024
to bolster the moral fiber
of the Federation.

727
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:27,554
I do not expect you
to understand.

728
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,163
I understand...

729
00:36:30,205 --> 00:36:32,199
even better than you do.

730
00:36:32,244 --> 00:36:35,081
What you did had nothing
to do with Risa

731
00:36:35,117 --> 00:36:39,719
or the Essentialists,
or even the Federation.

732
00:36:39,761 --> 00:36:42,734
It's about you and me.

733
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:48,442
You give yourself
far too much credit.

734
00:36:48,483 --> 00:36:49,679
Do I?

735
00:36:51,155 --> 00:36:55,028
You think I'm irresponsible,
frivolous...

736
00:36:55,065 --> 00:36:57,036
that I care more about pleasure

737
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:59,371
than I do commitment.

738
00:36:59,409 --> 00:37:03,442
What do you think is going on
between me and Arandis?

739
00:37:03,486 --> 00:37:05,514
You know what I think.

740
00:37:07,061 --> 00:37:08,655
That's right.
I do.

741
00:37:08,698 --> 00:37:10,327
And you know what?

742
00:37:10,368 --> 00:37:12,202
You're wrong.

743
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,205
Did it occur to you
to ask me about it?

744
00:37:16,249 --> 00:37:20,020
Or... trust, just a little?

745
00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:23,363
A Klingon woman would not have
given me grounds for suspicion.

746
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:25,267
And how would you know?

747
00:37:25,304 --> 00:37:28,676
Curzon spent more time
with Klingons than you ever did.

748
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:32,051
You may have lived
among my people

749
00:37:32,088 --> 00:37:33,751
but you are not a Klingon.

750
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:34,759
I am.

751
00:37:34,793 --> 00:37:36,057
Maybe so

752
00:37:36,097 --> 00:37:39,229
but you're not like
any Klingon I've ever met.

753
00:37:43,882 --> 00:37:46,115
What happened to you, Worf?

754
00:37:46,154 --> 00:37:49,959
You're a paragon
of Klingon honor and discipline

755
00:37:49,997 --> 00:37:54,497
but when it comes to the Klingon
passion for life, the exuberance

756
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:56,535
the enjoyment of the moment

757
00:37:56,579 --> 00:38:00,042
you are constantly
holding yourself back.

758
00:38:00,088 --> 00:38:01,819
Why?

759
00:38:01,858 --> 00:38:04,261
That is not the issue here.

760
00:38:04,298 --> 00:38:05,665
I think it is.

761
00:38:09,176 --> 00:38:12,708
I do not wish to lose you,
Jadzia.

762
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:15,849
Then talk to me, please.

763
00:38:21,573 --> 00:38:23,167
You know from the age of seven

764
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:25,876
I was raised by humans
on the farm world of Gault.

765
00:38:25,916 --> 00:38:28,480
It was a sparsely
populated world

766
00:38:28,522 --> 00:38:30,652
no more than 20,000 inhabitants.

767
00:38:32,064 --> 00:38:35,561
It often seemed as though
everyone knew everybody else

768
00:38:35,606 --> 00:38:37,269
but one thing was for certain.

769
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,404
Everybody knew me.

770
00:38:38,446 --> 00:38:42,650
I was the Klingon child,
the uncontrollable one.

771
00:38:42,689 --> 00:38:44,352
I was the biggest, the strongest

772
00:38:44,394 --> 00:38:46,763
the most fearless child
on the entire planet.

773
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:50,137
I fought hard, played hard,
did as I pleased.

774
00:38:50,174 --> 00:38:52,942
What changed?

775
00:38:53,015 --> 00:38:57,755
When I was 13, I was captain
of my school soccer team.

776
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:03,101
We had made the championships,
and I was determined to win.

777
00:39:03,139 --> 00:39:04,904
Near the end of the second half
with the score tied

778
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,709
my team got a corner kick.

779
00:39:07,749 --> 00:39:09,777
The ball sailed up high.

780
00:39:09,821 --> 00:39:13,193
Both I and one of my opponents,
a human boy named Mikel

781
00:39:13,229 --> 00:39:16,259
leapt up to head the ball.

782
00:39:16,303 --> 00:39:21,509
He had position,
but I was determined to score.

783
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,682
I remember laughing
with excitement

784
00:39:24,724 --> 00:39:26,820
as I threw myself at him.

785
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,799
Go on.

786
00:39:34,179 --> 00:39:35,169
The next thing I knew

787
00:39:35,216 --> 00:39:37,312
the ball was sailing
into their goal.

788
00:39:37,354 --> 00:39:40,760
I roared with triumph

789
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,289
and turned around to Mikel
to gloat

790
00:39:43,335 --> 00:39:46,365
only to find him lying
in the grass bleeding.

791
00:39:46,409 --> 00:39:48,880
Our heads had collided

792
00:39:48,915 --> 00:39:50,783
when we both went up
for the ball.

793
00:39:50,819 --> 00:39:52,687
I had not felt the impact

794
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:56,221
but I had broken his neck,
and...

795
00:39:56,266 --> 00:39:58,134
he died the next day.

796
00:40:01,311 --> 00:40:03,008
It was an accident.

797
00:40:03,049 --> 00:40:04,986
Which only makes it worse.

798
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:09,360
Compared to Klingons,
humans are fragile creatures.

799
00:40:09,397 --> 00:40:11,595
I realized at that moment

800
00:40:11,636 --> 00:40:15,635
to live among them,
I must practice restraint.

801
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:18,311
That must have been
difficult for you.

802
00:40:18,352 --> 00:40:20,083
At first.

803
00:40:20,156 --> 00:40:23,961
In time, it became a part
of who I was...

804
00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:25,662
who... I am.

805
00:40:27,407 --> 00:40:30,813
And you're still afraid
that if you lose control...

806
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:37,724
Someone I care about
might get hurt.

807
00:40:40,572 --> 00:40:42,770
That explains a lot...

808
00:40:44,347 --> 00:40:46,477
but you have to realize

809
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:49,151
there are some things
in life you can't control

810
00:40:49,226 --> 00:40:52,063
and one of them is me.

811
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:54,765
But what you can do is trust me.

812
00:40:54,806 --> 00:40:58,042
I care about you, Worf

813
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:01,715
and I would never do
anything to hurt you.

814
00:41:01,756 --> 00:41:04,456
Nor would I do
anything to hurt you.

815
00:41:07,336 --> 00:41:09,432
Who knows?

816
00:41:09,474 --> 00:41:13,381
I may have more self-control
than you give me credit for.

817
00:41:16,258 --> 00:41:18,729
That felt like an earthquake.

818
00:41:20,969 --> 00:41:22,461
So did that.

819
00:41:22,506 --> 00:41:24,306
The Essentialists.

820
00:41:26,482 --> 00:41:27,849
You should see them all run.

821
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,687
I think they finally realized
that the party's over.

822
00:41:30,725 --> 00:41:31,955
Increase the feedback

823
00:41:31,995 --> 00:41:33,555
in the tectonic
stress regulators.

824
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:34,658
If I do, there won't be

825
00:41:34,702 --> 00:41:36,935
a building left standing
on this part of Risa.

826
00:41:38,277 --> 00:41:41,148
It might be a good idea
to head to the spaceport.

827
00:41:42,788 --> 00:41:45,225
Or at least get
out of this room.

828
00:41:47,165 --> 00:41:48,498
Very well.

829
00:41:48,535 --> 00:41:51,235
I think our work is done here.

830
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:54,180
The uplink... give it to me.

831
00:41:54,215 --> 00:41:55,548
Mr. Worf, I suggest

832
00:41:55,585 --> 00:41:58,217
you all get off this planet
as soon as possible.

833
00:41:58,258 --> 00:42:00,023
I have no wish to see you

834
00:42:00,062 --> 00:42:01,030
or your friends harmed.

835
00:42:01,065 --> 00:42:02,329
Give us the uplink

836
00:42:02,368 --> 00:42:04,236
or the only person
who will be harmed is you.

837
00:42:09,017 --> 00:42:10,885
I thought you were one of us.

838
00:42:10,921 --> 00:42:14,088
Perhaps I was for a time,
but I believe

839
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:16,601
the Federation will survive
the Dominion, the Borg

840
00:42:16,635 --> 00:42:18,400
and people like you.

841
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,636
Mr. Worf...

842
00:42:19,676 --> 00:42:20,940
if you walk out of here now

843
00:42:20,979 --> 00:42:22,882
you'll be turning your back
on the Federation.

844
00:42:22,917 --> 00:42:24,011
Don't you see?

845
00:42:24,053 --> 00:42:26,217
Overindulgence,
lack of self-control...

846
00:42:26,259 --> 00:42:28,891
they'll destroy
everything we hold dear

847
00:42:28,932 --> 00:42:30,960
and you will be responsible.

848
00:42:31,003 --> 00:42:32,472
You say that we have to return

849
00:42:32,507 --> 00:42:34,067
to traditional
Federation values.

850
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,079
Well, I agree

851
00:42:35,113 --> 00:42:39,146
but one of those values
is trust.

852
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:43,930
It is essential
that we remember that.

853
00:42:43,968 --> 00:42:46,532
Don't you walk away from me.

854
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:53,782
I will do as I please.

855
00:43:00,373 --> 00:43:02,640
I am on vacation.

856
00:43:11,133 --> 00:43:14,471
Figures... the weather
improves the day we leave.

857
00:43:14,507 --> 00:43:16,910
I can't wait to get home.

858
00:43:16,947 --> 00:43:20,114
Not that I didn't enjoy myself.

859
00:43:20,154 --> 00:43:22,455
I'd better go find Bashir.

860
00:43:22,493 --> 00:43:24,122
He brought a <i>Horga'hn</i>
down to breakfast

861
00:43:24,164 --> 00:43:25,656
and that's the last
I saw of him.

862
00:43:27,873 --> 00:43:30,242
I hope the two of you
enjoyed Risa

863
00:43:30,278 --> 00:43:31,713
and will come again.

864
00:43:31,748 --> 00:43:34,550
I did not think
that I would be welcome.

865
00:43:34,589 --> 00:43:37,357
Well, you still have
a lot to learn about our people.

866
00:43:37,395 --> 00:43:41,360
I never got a chance
to say good-bye to Curzon Dax.

867
00:43:41,472 --> 00:43:43,375
And you're not saying
good-bye to me either.

868
00:43:43,477 --> 00:43:44,707
I'll be back.

869
00:43:46,811 --> 00:43:49,180
And Risa will be waiting.

870
00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:54,796
So, what do we do now?

871
00:43:54,831 --> 00:43:58,397
Now we watch the suns set.

872
00:43:58,439 --> 00:44:00,706
I have a better idea.

873
00:44:00,745 --> 00:44:02,807
Why don't we go swimming?

874
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:06,313
I... didn't bring
a bathing suit.

875
00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:10,357
I won't tell if you don't.
