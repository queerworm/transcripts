1
00:00:06,876 --> 00:00:08,506
It's funny...

2
00:00:08,547 --> 00:00:11,680
before yesterday, I'd never
set foot on this station, but...

3
00:00:11,722 --> 00:00:15,893
it's as familiar to me
as the back of my hand.

4
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:17,492
Isn't that odd?

5
00:00:20,512 --> 00:00:23,007
You have no idea who I am,
do you?

6
00:00:24,588 --> 00:00:26,582
I didn't think so.

7
00:00:26,628 --> 00:00:29,932
Thanks for listening, anyway.

8
00:01:29,624 --> 00:01:31,059
I was killed here.

9
00:01:32,565 --> 00:01:34,559
I mean, Jadzia was.

10
00:01:38,046 --> 00:01:41,579
I try not to think about that.

11
00:01:41,622 --> 00:01:45,621
If I did, I'm not sure
that I could come back here.

12
00:01:47,336 --> 00:01:49,706
It's a strange sensation...

13
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,144
dying.

14
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,914
No matter how many times
it happens to you

15
00:01:53,954 --> 00:01:55,618
you never get used to it.

16
00:01:59,435 --> 00:02:02,341
It must be
a little disconcerting for you

17
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:05,109
knowing that I have
Jadzia's memories.

18
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,486
No wonder you're uncomfortable.

19
00:02:08,525 --> 00:02:10,793
It's a lot to get used to.

20
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:13,133
Tell me about it.

21
00:02:14,674 --> 00:02:16,007
Well...

22
00:02:16,044 --> 00:02:18,744
I'll let you get
to your prayers.

23
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,898
Bloodwine.

24
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:39,130
That's the good stuff.

25
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:41,609
The same vintage I served
when you and Worf got married.

26
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:44,918
It smells awful.

27
00:02:44,953 --> 00:02:46,252
Ah...

28
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,193
it used to be your favorite.

29
00:02:48,228 --> 00:02:50,564
I used to be right-handed, too.

30
00:02:50,601 --> 00:02:54,236
A lot of things have changed
since I was joined.

31
00:02:54,277 --> 00:02:55,644
I can imagine.

32
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:58,883
Seven lifetimes worth
of memories

33
00:02:58,923 --> 00:03:00,917
would mix up anyone.

34
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:02,430
Or is it eight?

35
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:03,627
Who knows anymore?

36
00:03:03,668 --> 00:03:06,402
It will be a lot easier
once you get settled in.

37
00:03:06,442 --> 00:03:08,470
Have you picked out
your quarters yet?

38
00:03:09,751 --> 00:03:11,551
I'm not staying.

39
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:14,427
I'm going back to the <i>Destiny</i>
to be an Assistant Counselor.

40
00:03:14,463 --> 00:03:15,454
You're a therapist?

41
00:03:15,565 --> 00:03:17,661
Why does everyone
sound so surprised

42
00:03:17,705 --> 00:03:18,935
when they hear that?

43
00:03:18,975 --> 00:03:21,037
Oh, it's just, uh...

44
00:03:22,483 --> 00:03:24,043
you're so young.

45
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:28,627
Why are you in such a hurry
to leave?

46
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,158
Why not stay for awhile

47
00:03:30,204 --> 00:03:31,970
and get to know
your old friends again?

48
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:34,675
I don't want to force things.

49
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,517
People need time to get over
losing Jadzia.

50
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:38,785
Mm-hmm.

51
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:39,921
You know something, Quark?

52
00:03:39,962 --> 00:03:41,261
Besides Benjamin

53
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,066
you're the only one
of Jadzia's friends

54
00:03:43,103 --> 00:03:45,199
who doesn't seem
uncomfortable around me.

55
00:03:45,243 --> 00:03:46,975
She and I were close.

56
00:03:47,014 --> 00:03:51,355
I don't see any reason
why we shouldn't be close, too.

57
00:03:51,392 --> 00:03:54,798
Remember all those
late night <i>tongo</i> games?

58
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,360
Who could forget?

59
00:03:56,405 --> 00:03:57,965
Hmm.

60
00:03:58,009 --> 00:03:59,478
Wait a minute.

61
00:03:59,513 --> 00:04:02,487
You owe me ten strips of latinum
from our last game.

62
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,822
I don't think so.

63
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,230
Yes. I won with a full
consortium. I remember.

64
00:04:07,267 --> 00:04:09,397
Your memory's playing
tricks on you.

65
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:10,407
Don't say that, Quark.

66
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:13,381
I'm confused enough as it is.

67
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,612
Look who's here.

68
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:24,676
I bet the two of you
have a lot to talk about.

69
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:33,625
Come in.

70
00:06:56,328 --> 00:06:57,923
Dax.

71
00:06:57,966 --> 00:06:58,957
Are you alone?

72
00:07:00,672 --> 00:07:02,506
Why are you
sneaking in this way?

73
00:07:03,547 --> 00:07:05,313
I didn't want
to go through Ops

74
00:07:05,351 --> 00:07:06,718
in case Worf was there.

75
00:07:06,755 --> 00:07:09,627
We bumped into each other
last night at Quark's.

76
00:07:10,632 --> 00:07:12,728
It didn't go well, I take it.

77
00:07:14,073 --> 00:07:15,406
You weren't expecting him

78
00:07:15,444 --> 00:07:17,278
to accept you right away,
were you?

79
00:07:17,316 --> 00:07:20,381
Of course not, but he wouldn't
even talk to me.

80
00:07:20,424 --> 00:07:23,421
Well, perhaps he was just
trying to honor your customs.

81
00:07:23,464 --> 00:07:26,563
He knows that the joined Trill
aren't supposed to get involved

82
00:07:26,606 --> 00:07:28,736
with people who were married
to their previous hosts.

83
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:30,773
But that doesn't mean that we
can't talk to each other.

84
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:31,786
Worf knows that.

85
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,380
Are you sure?

86
00:07:33,424 --> 00:07:35,395
I told him all about
Trill traditions...

87
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,399
Jadzia did.

88
00:07:36,432 --> 00:07:37,401
We discussed them...

89
00:07:37,435 --> 00:07:38,870
they discussed them.

90
00:07:38,905 --> 00:07:40,500
I understand.

91
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,879
These pronouns are going
to drive me crazy.

92
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,486
Look at him, Benjamin.

93
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:49,596
He's in pain.

94
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:52,935
How can you tell?

95
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,000
I was his wife.

96
00:07:55,044 --> 00:07:56,604
I can tell.

97
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,320
I don't want to put him through
any more heartache

98
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,126
than he's already going through.

99
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:06,500
It's a good thing I'm going
back to the <i>Destiny.</i>

100
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,120
You're still planning
on leaving?

101
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,361
I can't stay here.

102
00:08:17,402 --> 00:08:19,670
I couldn't do that to him.

103
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:23,810
Besides, I think it might be
easier for me on the <i>Destiny.</i>

104
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:26,322
There are
too many memories here.

105
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:31,563
I'm going to miss you, old man.

106
00:08:33,744 --> 00:08:36,410
I'm going to miss you, too,
Benjamin.

107
00:08:38,824 --> 00:08:40,727
If you feel that strongly,
Miles, it's all right.

108
00:08:40,762 --> 00:08:41,731
You can be Crockett.

109
00:08:41,764 --> 00:08:42,858
I'll be Travis.

110
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:45,201
And, and who am I
going to be again?

111
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,209
General Santa Anna.

112
00:08:46,243 --> 00:08:47,507
Santa Anna.

113
00:08:47,547 --> 00:08:48,743
When can our costumes be ready?

114
00:08:49,785 --> 00:08:50,754
Garak?

115
00:08:50,788 --> 00:08:52,087
Hmm?

116
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,221
Our holosuite costumes?
When can they be ready?

117
00:08:54,263 --> 00:08:56,029
Oh, I'm afraid you're going
to have to find them

118
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,037
from somewhere else.

119
00:08:57,071 --> 00:08:58,040
The shop's closed.

120
00:08:58,074 --> 00:08:59,908
Still?

121
00:08:59,946 --> 00:09:01,006
Well, Starfleet Intelligence

122
00:09:01,048 --> 00:09:02,449
is keeping me quite busy
these days.

123
00:09:02,485 --> 00:09:04,285
Well, what if we let
you be Crockett?

124
00:09:04,324 --> 00:09:05,452
Hey!

125
00:09:05,492 --> 00:09:08,226
Even if I was interested,
I don't have the time.

126
00:09:08,267 --> 00:09:10,739
Do you have any idea
how long it takes to decode

127
00:09:10,773 --> 00:09:12,573
a Cardassian military
transmission?

128
00:09:12,612 --> 00:09:13,706
I mean, I invented

129
00:09:13,748 --> 00:09:16,084
some of the basic
encryption protocols

130
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,886
when I was with Obsidian Order

131
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,826
but it still takes me
several days

132
00:09:19,863 --> 00:09:21,834
to decipher
the simplest sentence.

133
00:09:21,869 --> 00:09:23,499
You've got to take
a break sometime.

134
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:25,008
Well, I intend to...

135
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:28,348
just as soon as the Dominion
is driven off Cardassia.

136
00:09:28,386 --> 00:09:30,323
Must you stand so close?!

137
00:09:31,827 --> 00:09:33,695
That was a bit harsh.

138
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:37,470
Well, I don't like people
looming over me.

139
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,174
I have to get back to work.

140
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:42,645
Thank you for your company,
gentlemen.

141
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:50,324
I can't... breathe.

142
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:52,699
Garak!

143
00:10:52,738 --> 00:10:54,139
Odo to the Infirmary.

144
00:10:54,242 --> 00:10:56,145
We have a medical emergency.

145
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,513
Garak?

146
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:04,194
He had a claustrophobic attack
in his shop.

147
00:11:04,234 --> 00:11:05,533
His shop?

148
00:11:05,571 --> 00:11:07,040
I don't understand.

149
00:11:07,075 --> 00:11:08,943
That's a good-sized space.

150
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,117
I know. I've been claustrophobic
for as long as I can remember

151
00:11:13,224 --> 00:11:15,388
but lately,
it seems to have gotten worse.

152
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,894
Rooms that I once found
completely tolerable

153
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:23,247
now suddenly feel
alarmingly... cramped.

154
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:24,776
Well, I wish I had
an explanation,

155
00:11:24,821 --> 00:11:26,347
but I don't.

156
00:11:26,391 --> 00:11:27,621
He checks out fine.

157
00:11:27,662 --> 00:11:30,100
Well, I don't feel fine.

158
00:11:30,134 --> 00:11:32,002
Would you gentlemen
mind terribly

159
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:35,309
if we continued this
conversation on the Promenade?

160
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,458
Better?

161
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,799
A little.

162
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:46,332
Mr. Garak, as much as I
appreciate your situation

163
00:11:46,377 --> 00:11:48,541
I'm not sure why
you asked to see me.

164
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,520
I was hoping you'd
be kind enough

165
00:11:50,554 --> 00:11:53,460
to express my regrets to
Starfleet Intelligence.

166
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:54,658
When I get this way

167
00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:57,194
my concentration isn't
what it should be.

168
00:11:57,239 --> 00:12:00,680
I'm afraid I won't be decoding
any transmissions for awhile.

169
00:12:00,714 --> 00:12:03,552
Can I tell them when to expect
you back on the job?

170
00:12:03,588 --> 00:12:04,784
I wish I could say.

171
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:08,494
Believe me, I'm not
happy about this, either.

172
00:12:08,535 --> 00:12:12,876
I want to see an end to this war
just as much as you.

173
00:12:12,913 --> 00:12:17,620
And, now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to hem some pants.

174
00:12:17,658 --> 00:12:21,566
For some reason, sewing
seems to calm me down.

175
00:12:26,715 --> 00:12:28,345
Sewing?

176
00:12:28,387 --> 00:12:31,520
We can't afford
to lose Mr. Garak right now.

177
00:12:31,561 --> 00:12:34,363
Is there anything
you can do for him?

178
00:12:34,402 --> 00:12:35,530
Well, to be blunt

179
00:12:35,571 --> 00:12:38,409
our friend Garak
needs his head examined.

180
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:41,442
Me?

181
00:12:41,486 --> 00:12:43,150
You want me to work with Garak?

182
00:12:43,191 --> 00:12:45,219
You're a counselor,
aren't you?

183
00:12:45,263 --> 00:12:46,289
Assistant counselor.

184
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:47,562
I'm still in training.

185
00:12:47,602 --> 00:12:48,935
Oh, come on, Dax

186
00:12:48,972 --> 00:12:51,308
what are you going
to learn in the next few months

187
00:12:51,345 --> 00:12:53,977
that you haven't already learned
in the last 300 years?

188
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:55,113
Oh, how to keep

189
00:12:55,155 --> 00:12:57,251
from breaking into tears
for no reason

190
00:12:57,295 --> 00:12:59,665
how to resist the urge
to stand on my head...

191
00:12:59,701 --> 00:13:00,795
things like that.

192
00:13:00,837 --> 00:13:04,141
Why are you standing
on your head, by the way?

193
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:05,478
Emony used to do it.

194
00:13:05,516 --> 00:13:06,712
The gymnast.

195
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,221
She found it relaxing.

196
00:13:08,256 --> 00:13:09,725
Do you?

197
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,632
Actually, it's giving me
a headache.

198
00:13:16,612 --> 00:13:18,412
Why can't Julian
work with Garak?

199
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:21,047
Oh, Julian's a good doctor,
but he's no counselor...

200
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,890
not even an
assistant counselor...

201
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:24,592
and besides, he doesn't have

202
00:13:24,632 --> 00:13:27,332
eight lifetimes' worth
of experience under his belt.

203
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,105
I bet he doesn't stand on his
head for no reason, either.

204
00:13:30,146 --> 00:13:31,513
That's a good point.

205
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,922
Oh, come on, old man,
you can do this.

206
00:13:36,162 --> 00:13:37,631
All right.

207
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,135
I'll try.

208
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:42,303
I just wish I had as much
confidence in me as you do.

209
00:13:45,352 --> 00:13:46,548
So, what do you think?

210
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:47,580
About what?

211
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:48,651
About her.

212
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:49,664
About who?

213
00:13:49,697 --> 00:13:50,996
Dax.

214
00:13:51,034 --> 00:13:52,902
Oh, Ezri.

215
00:13:52,939 --> 00:13:54,739
She seems... nice.

216
00:13:54,777 --> 00:13:56,144
Meaning what?

217
00:13:56,181 --> 00:13:57,913
Meaning... nice.

218
00:13:57,952 --> 00:13:59,353
Oh, come on, Doctor.

219
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:01,519
I know the way you felt
about Jadzia.

220
00:14:01,561 --> 00:14:02,723
But she's not Jadzia.

221
00:14:02,764 --> 00:14:04,428
She's the next best thing.

222
00:14:06,273 --> 00:14:08,369
So... are you interested?

223
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:11,043
Sounds to me like you're the one
who's interested, Quark.

224
00:14:11,086 --> 00:14:12,055
It's not every day

225
00:14:12,088 --> 00:14:13,648
you get a second chance
with a woman.

226
00:14:13,693 --> 00:14:15,094
It's not the same woman.

227
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,398
She's still Dax, isn't she?

228
00:14:17,436 --> 00:14:19,407
More or less.

229
00:14:19,474 --> 00:14:20,875
Well, that's good enough for me.

230
00:14:20,911 --> 00:14:23,075
Ready for a little competition?

231
00:14:24,153 --> 00:14:25,417
You're insane.

232
00:14:25,524 --> 00:14:27,222
And you...

233
00:14:27,261 --> 00:14:28,925
are going to lose.

234
00:14:32,909 --> 00:14:34,743
Am I interrupting?

235
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,512
Ah...

236
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,027
You must be Ezri Dax.

237
00:14:40,061 --> 00:14:43,058
The Captain told me
that you'd be dropping by

238
00:14:43,103 --> 00:14:44,869
to counsel me.

239
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:46,845
Is that all right?

240
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:49,647
Well, it all depends
on what it involves.

241
00:14:49,686 --> 00:14:52,250
I'm a very private person,
you know.

242
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,454
I understand.

243
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,359
So, is it helping?

244
00:14:57,929 --> 00:14:59,159
The sewing...

245
00:14:59,267 --> 00:15:01,363
is it making you feel better?

246
00:15:01,405 --> 00:15:03,639
Thankfully... yes.

247
00:15:03,678 --> 00:15:04,647
You're lucky.

248
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,910
Nothing helps me.

249
00:15:06,986 --> 00:15:08,650
Are you claustrophobic, too?

250
00:15:09,994 --> 00:15:11,327
Why would you say that?

251
00:15:11,364 --> 00:15:13,426
You just said...

252
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:16,877
No. I get spacesick...

253
00:15:16,912 --> 00:15:18,438
ever since I was joined.

254
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:20,717
I'm very sensitive
to motion.

255
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:22,487
I can even feel
the station spinning.

256
00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:23,496
Really?

257
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:26,401
It's because of what
happened to Torias.

258
00:15:26,437 --> 00:15:28,567
He was killed in
a shuttle accident.

259
00:15:28,609 --> 00:15:31,879
But why would that
make you spacesick?

260
00:15:31,918 --> 00:15:34,082
Because I blame myself
for what happened.

261
00:15:34,123 --> 00:15:35,387
You were piloting.

262
00:15:35,426 --> 00:15:36,395
Yes.

263
00:15:36,429 --> 00:15:37,089
No.

264
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:39,729
Depends on how you look at it.

265
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:41,104
Torias was my fifth host.

266
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:42,440
Didn't I say that?

267
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:43,448
Uh, no.

268
00:15:43,481 --> 00:15:44,848
Well, he was

269
00:15:44,884 --> 00:15:46,376
and I think the reason

270
00:15:46,422 --> 00:15:49,156
that his death has stayed
with me for so long is because

271
00:15:49,195 --> 00:15:52,192
I just can't seem to forgive him
for getting himself killed.

272
00:15:52,237 --> 00:15:54,231
But you said it was an accident.

273
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:55,835
So, if he's not to blame

274
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,942
then you're not to blame,
either.

275
00:15:57,985 --> 00:15:59,249
I know

276
00:15:59,288 --> 00:16:02,490
but somehow I can't help
but punish myself for it.

277
00:16:02,531 --> 00:16:05,060
By getting... spacesick.

278
00:16:05,104 --> 00:16:07,098
Exactly.

279
00:16:07,142 --> 00:16:08,908
Don't take this the wrong way

280
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:11,476
but it sounds to me
as if you're the one

281
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,320
who needs to see a counselor.

282
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:15,227
You're probably right...

283
00:16:15,297 --> 00:16:18,761
but I didn't come here
to talk about myself.

284
00:16:18,806 --> 00:16:20,834
I came to talk about you.

285
00:16:20,878 --> 00:16:22,644
So you did.

286
00:16:25,056 --> 00:16:27,027
Do you remember
anything traumatic

287
00:16:27,061 --> 00:16:29,397
happening to you
when you were young...

288
00:16:29,434 --> 00:16:32,272
something involving being
trapped in a confined space?

289
00:16:32,374 --> 00:16:33,934
If I had been that careless

290
00:16:33,979 --> 00:16:35,973
my father would have
left me there

291
00:16:36,017 --> 00:16:37,281
to teach me a lesson.

292
00:16:37,354 --> 00:16:40,760
Sounds like he was strict.

293
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:44,295
He didn't get to be head
of the Obsidian Order

294
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:46,902
without a sense of discipline.

295
00:16:46,946 --> 00:16:48,814
Did he discipline you?

296
00:16:48,851 --> 00:16:51,585
He punished me
when I misbehaved.

297
00:16:51,624 --> 00:16:53,184
What father wouldn't?

298
00:16:53,229 --> 00:16:54,528
Tobin.

299
00:16:54,566 --> 00:16:56,035
Who?

300
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:57,699
My second host.

301
00:16:57,741 --> 00:16:59,837
He could not bring himself
to discipline his children

302
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:01,439
no matter what they did...

303
00:17:02,486 --> 00:17:04,685
but... that's another story.

304
00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:07,391
How did you say that
your father punished you?

305
00:17:07,432 --> 00:17:09,904
He'd lock me in a closet.

306
00:17:09,938 --> 00:17:11,568
Why didn't you mention that

307
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:14,412
when I asked if you'd ever been
trapped in a confined space?

308
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,783
I wasn't trapped.

309
00:17:15,821 --> 00:17:19,125
I knew he'd let me out
as soon as I learned my lesson.

310
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,496
Learned your lesson?

311
00:17:20,533 --> 00:17:23,301
Did you think you deserved
to be locked in that closet?

312
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,040
I could be very stubborn.

313
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,484
You blame yourself...

314
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,223
just like I blame myself
for that shuttle accident.

315
00:17:32,263 --> 00:17:34,325
Maybe you get claustrophobic

316
00:17:34,368 --> 00:17:37,308
for the same reason
that I get spacesick.

317
00:17:37,343 --> 00:17:39,577
We're both punishing ourselves

318
00:17:39,616 --> 00:17:42,248
for things
that weren't our fault.

319
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:43,383
That's it!

320
00:17:43,459 --> 00:17:44,928
Don't you see?

321
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:48,996
We both have to let go
of all this misplaced guilt.

322
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,880
And if we do, our problems
will simply disappear?

323
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:56,415
Well, not overnight, but it's
a step in the right direction.

324
00:17:56,493 --> 00:18:00,698
Well, I'll certainly
give your advice some thought.

325
00:18:00,737 --> 00:18:02,503
Me, too.

326
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:11,657
Are you all right?

327
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:12,861
To tell the truth

328
00:18:12,902 --> 00:18:15,704
I'm starting to feel
a little claustrophobic.

329
00:18:15,742 --> 00:18:18,580
Probably because we've
been talking about it.

330
00:18:18,617 --> 00:18:20,018
Actually, I'm starting

331
00:18:20,054 --> 00:18:22,184
to feel a little spacesick
myself.

332
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,094
If it's all the same to you

333
00:18:24,131 --> 00:18:26,535
I think I'll go back
to my sewing.

334
00:18:26,571 --> 00:18:27,870
Good idea.

335
00:18:27,908 --> 00:18:30,210
Thank you for stopping by.

336
00:18:30,247 --> 00:18:31,580
My pleasure.

337
00:18:54,143 --> 00:18:55,612
Ooh...

338
00:19:02,765 --> 00:19:04,257
Hello, Worf.

339
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:06,738
Ensign.

340
00:19:06,775 --> 00:19:09,247
"Ensign"?

341
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:11,481
That's all you have
to say to me?

342
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,582
What more is there to say?

343
00:19:14,628 --> 00:19:16,063
I was your wife.

344
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,003
You are not Jadzia.

345
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:19,507
Jadzia died
and went to <i>Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

346
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,603
I do not know you...

347
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:23,447
nor do I wish to know you.

348
00:19:40,061 --> 00:19:41,725
Come in.

349
00:19:48,316 --> 00:19:50,219
Dax?

350
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:54,191
Do you think the Chief could
adjust the inertial dampers

351
00:19:54,232 --> 00:19:57,138
so that the station would
spin a little slower?

352
00:19:57,172 --> 00:19:59,610
I don't know. Why?

353
00:19:59,645 --> 00:20:02,379
Never mind.

354
00:20:04,258 --> 00:20:06,354
To what do I owe the pleasure?

355
00:20:06,396 --> 00:20:08,960
I'm not going to say
"I told you so"

356
00:20:09,003 --> 00:20:11,305
but Garak stopped by
Odo's office this morning

357
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,645
to pick up the latest
Cardassian transmissions

358
00:20:13,749 --> 00:20:14,648
for decoding.

359
00:20:14,751 --> 00:20:15,650
Really?

360
00:20:15,754 --> 00:20:16,950
It looks like Garak's

361
00:20:16,991 --> 00:20:18,928
claustrophobia is under control.

362
00:20:18,962 --> 00:20:22,563
Huh.
I guess our talk helped him.

363
00:20:22,605 --> 00:20:23,904
I told you so.

364
00:20:23,942 --> 00:20:26,676
I thought you weren't going
to say that.

365
00:20:26,783 --> 00:20:28,413
I couldn't resist.

366
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:34,797
Are you all right?

367
00:20:36,676 --> 00:20:38,910
I talked with Worf.

368
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:42,616
He doesn't want to have
anything to do with me.

369
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,096
Perhaps I should have
a talk with him.

370
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:47,899
Absolutely not.

371
00:20:47,938 --> 00:20:49,305
You intimidate him.

372
00:20:49,342 --> 00:20:50,207
Me?

373
00:20:50,243 --> 00:20:52,442
Don't tell him I told you.

374
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:57,653
I intimidate Worf, huh?

375
00:20:57,696 --> 00:20:59,360
You like that, don't you?

376
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,303
Of course not.

377
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:02,308
Come on.

378
00:21:02,342 --> 00:21:04,712
I've been a man, I know.

379
00:21:04,748 --> 00:21:07,277
Look, we're not talking
about me and Worf

380
00:21:07,321 --> 00:21:09,349
we're talking
about you and Worf.

381
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:12,128
Now, I sympathize
with what he's going through

382
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:13,727
but as far as I'm concerned

383
00:21:13,838 --> 00:21:16,538
you have as much right
to be here as he does.

384
00:21:16,578 --> 00:21:18,412
What are you getting at,
Benjamin?

385
00:21:19,921 --> 00:21:21,619
The war...

386
00:21:21,658 --> 00:21:25,761
has certainly not been very good
for morale around here.

387
00:21:25,836 --> 00:21:27,534
I've been thinking...

388
00:21:27,574 --> 00:21:30,308
the station could use
a good counselor.

389
00:21:30,347 --> 00:21:33,914
I can't think of anyone
better suited for the job.

390
00:21:33,957 --> 00:21:37,660
Thanks for saying that,
but even if Worf wasn't an issue

391
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,195
I'm still just an
assistant counselor.

392
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,807
I took the liberty of talking
to Starfleet Medical

393
00:21:43,883 --> 00:21:46,721
and they're willing to waive
the rest of your training

394
00:21:46,756 --> 00:21:49,126
and give you a commission
as a full counselor

395
00:21:49,163 --> 00:21:50,655
with the rank of Lieutenant.

396
00:21:51,871 --> 00:21:54,035
How'd you talk them into that?

397
00:21:54,076 --> 00:21:56,844
I asked them what they thought
you might learn in the next

398
00:21:56,884 --> 00:21:58,012
few months...

399
00:21:58,053 --> 00:22:00,462
That I haven't already learned
in the last 300 years.

400
00:22:00,595 --> 00:22:01,791
They saw my point.

401
00:22:01,832 --> 00:22:03,301
I hope you do, too.

402
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:09,178
It means a lot to me that you
want me to stay, but I can't.

403
00:22:09,217 --> 00:22:10,618
Because of Worf?

404
00:22:10,655 --> 00:22:12,683
Hmm... mostly.

405
00:22:14,297 --> 00:22:17,635
Well... you just say the word

406
00:22:17,673 --> 00:22:21,079
and I will
intimidate him for you.

407
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,808
I'danian spice pudding.

408
00:22:31,842 --> 00:22:33,540
No, cancel that.

409
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,072
I'll have a...

410
00:22:35,118 --> 00:22:36,952
kilm steak, rare.

411
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:40,693
No. Tobin was a vegetarian.

412
00:22:41,969 --> 00:22:43,370
Give me...

413
00:22:43,406 --> 00:22:45,536
Two Fanalian toddies...

414
00:22:48,051 --> 00:22:49,077
hot.

415
00:22:49,121 --> 00:22:51,058
How'd you know?

416
00:22:51,092 --> 00:22:53,724
Lucky guess.

417
00:22:53,767 --> 00:22:55,966
Care to join me?

418
00:22:56,005 --> 00:22:57,304
Sure.

419
00:23:10,543 --> 00:23:12,012
So, um...

420
00:23:12,047 --> 00:23:13,881
here we are.

421
00:23:21,003 --> 00:23:22,563
What was that?

422
00:23:22,608 --> 00:23:23,838
What was what?

423
00:23:23,878 --> 00:23:24,869
That look.

424
00:23:24,913 --> 00:23:26,382
This might be

425
00:23:26,418 --> 00:23:29,654
the last thing you want to hear,
but, uh...

426
00:23:29,693 --> 00:23:31,687
you have Jadzia's eyes.

427
00:23:35,307 --> 00:23:37,073
I'm sorry. I, um...

428
00:23:37,112 --> 00:23:39,015
I shouldn't have said anything.

429
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,579
Don't flirt with me, Julian.
Please?

430
00:23:41,624 --> 00:23:42,923
I'm not.

431
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,760
I remember how you used
to flirt with Jadzia.

432
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,067
I... it was just an observation.

433
00:23:47,105 --> 00:23:49,475
Good, because I'm not like her.

434
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,482
She knew how to handle it.

435
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,954
Actually, she quite enjoyed it.

436
00:23:53,989 --> 00:23:55,288
Really?

437
00:23:55,326 --> 00:23:57,388
You didn't know?

438
00:23:57,431 --> 00:24:01,066
Well, I-I... I always suspected.

439
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:03,909
You can be very charming.

440
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,456
You want to know something?

441
00:24:07,557 --> 00:24:11,158
If Worf hadn't come along,
it would've been you.

442
00:24:21,895 --> 00:24:24,231
You really miss her, don't you?

443
00:24:26,641 --> 00:24:27,837
Yes.

444
00:24:27,877 --> 00:24:32,618
I, uh...
I suppose I always will

445
00:24:32,656 --> 00:24:37,397
but, uh, somehow,
talking to you... seems to help.

446
00:24:43,885 --> 00:24:45,856
Deputy Talpet to Dr. Bashir.

447
00:24:45,891 --> 00:24:47,190
Go ahead.

448
00:24:47,227 --> 00:24:49,699
We have a medical emergency
in Airlock 7.

449
00:24:49,734 --> 00:24:50,725
It's Garak, sir.

450
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,772
I'm on my way.

451
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:55,714
He's down there, Doctor.

452
00:25:01,498 --> 00:25:02,865
Garak!

453
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,234
What is he doing in there?

454
00:25:05,943 --> 00:25:07,641
Garak, open the door!

455
00:25:08,916 --> 00:25:11,913
Let me out.
Let me out.

456
00:25:26,028 --> 00:25:27,862
Breathe in...

457
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,998
and out.

458
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:32,601
In...

459
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,888
and out.

460
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:42,693
Better?

461
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:49,385
Hmm... it's beautiful,
isn't it?

462
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,154
Look at that sky.

463
00:25:51,193 --> 00:25:53,255
It just goes on and on.

464
00:25:53,298 --> 00:25:54,426
But it doesn't.

465
00:25:54,468 --> 00:25:56,028
It's an illusion.

466
00:25:56,073 --> 00:25:59,377
There's a holosuite wall
not ten meters in front of us.

467
00:25:59,414 --> 00:26:01,476
But you can't see it.

468
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,150
I can feel it.

469
00:26:03,191 --> 00:26:05,390
We could call up
another program.

470
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,768
I can't believe the way I
humiliated myself back there.

471
00:26:08,805 --> 00:26:11,870
I just... wanted to get out.

472
00:26:11,914 --> 00:26:13,509
I couldn't breathe.

473
00:26:13,552 --> 00:26:15,854
Well, if you were looking
for fresh air

474
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:18,294
you sure were knocking
on the wrong door.

475
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:20,598
I have to get this
situation under control.

476
00:26:20,636 --> 00:26:22,972
If I can't, I'll be forced
to leave the station

477
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:24,535
and then where will I go?

478
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,049
I can't go back to Cardassia.

479
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:29,024
I doubt if I'd be
welcome on... Bajor.

480
00:26:29,058 --> 00:26:31,428
You're not going to have
to leave the station.

481
00:26:33,202 --> 00:26:35,470
I'll talk to Quark
and tell him to leave

482
00:26:35,508 --> 00:26:38,208
this holosuite available
to you 26 hours a day.

483
00:26:38,249 --> 00:26:40,448
So the next time
you feel like jumping

484
00:26:40,488 --> 00:26:43,120
out the nearest airlock...
come here instead.

485
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:47,236
It's going to be all right.

486
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:50,111
We're going to get this
under control.

487
00:26:50,146 --> 00:26:51,137
I promise.

488
00:26:53,522 --> 00:26:55,926
If you don't mind,
I'd like to sit here

489
00:26:55,961 --> 00:26:57,453
and be alone for a while.

490
00:26:58,635 --> 00:27:00,869
I'll come and check in
on you later.

491
00:27:18,954 --> 00:27:20,253
Hold still.

492
00:27:21,294 --> 00:27:22,924
I think I've got something.

493
00:27:27,944 --> 00:27:29,642
I knew it.

494
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:33,215
Never get a tympanic tickle
from an amateur.

495
00:27:33,258 --> 00:27:34,557
A tympanic tickle?

496
00:27:34,595 --> 00:27:35,564
Yeah. It's...

497
00:27:35,598 --> 00:27:36,794
Never mind.
Uh, I don't want to know.

498
00:27:36,868 --> 00:27:37,801
Hold still.

499
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,670
I'm going to get you
some antibiotics.

500
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,020
We need to talk.

501
00:27:48,063 --> 00:27:49,396
About what?

502
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:53,410
Do not toy with me, Doctor.

503
00:27:53,444 --> 00:27:55,780
I know how you
felt about Jadzia.

504
00:27:55,817 --> 00:27:57,788
That was a long time ago.

505
00:27:57,822 --> 00:27:59,850
I saw you with her.

506
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:01,260
Jadzia?

507
00:28:01,298 --> 00:28:03,497
You know who I'm talking about.

508
00:28:03,536 --> 00:28:04,800
No, you've got it all wrong.

509
00:28:05,843 --> 00:28:07,335
Stay away from her.

510
00:28:07,379 --> 00:28:09,043
Now, wait just a minute.

511
00:28:09,084 --> 00:28:10,348
You...

512
00:28:10,387 --> 00:28:13,759
you have no right to tell me
who I can be friends with.

513
00:28:13,797 --> 00:28:17,432
If you dishonor
Jadzia's memory...

514
00:28:17,473 --> 00:28:19,775
you will regret it.

515
00:28:24,892 --> 00:28:27,126
And that goes for you, too,
Ferengi.

516
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:30,571
What did I do?

517
00:28:49,456 --> 00:28:50,425
Garak?

518
00:28:56,341 --> 00:28:58,939
I thought you were going to stay
in the holosuite for a while.

519
00:28:58,981 --> 00:29:01,579
I got tired of staring
at a fake landscape

520
00:29:01,621 --> 00:29:02,988
pretending I was outside.

521
00:29:03,024 --> 00:29:05,896
No, no, no.
Work is the answer.

522
00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:07,400
My father always used to say

523
00:29:07,435 --> 00:29:10,067
that people should throw
themselves into their work.

524
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,412
"Do your chores, Elim.

525
00:29:12,448 --> 00:29:14,647
I told you to do your chores."

526
00:29:14,688 --> 00:29:17,594
And if you didn't,
what would he do to you?

527
00:29:17,629 --> 00:29:19,657
Oh, no, no, no.
Please, don't start.

528
00:29:19,701 --> 00:29:22,503
Spare me your
insipid psychobabble.

529
00:29:22,542 --> 00:29:24,076
I'm not some quivering neurotic

530
00:29:24,209 --> 00:29:27,377
who feels sorry for himself
because his daddy wasn't nice.

531
00:29:27,417 --> 00:29:30,823
You couldn't begin
to understand me.

532
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:33,293
I'd like to try.

533
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:34,928
Oh, I'm sure you would.

534
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,303
You'd like nothing more

535
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,836
than to pry
into my personal affairs.

536
00:29:38,881 --> 00:29:41,878
Well, I'm not interested
in dissecting my childhood.

537
00:29:41,923 --> 00:29:45,125
I only want to save my people
from the Dominion.

538
00:29:45,164 --> 00:29:47,864
I don't need someone to walk
in here and hold my hand.

539
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:51,208
I want someone
to help me get back to work.

540
00:29:51,246 --> 00:29:55,313
And you, my dear,
are not up to this task.

541
00:29:55,357 --> 00:29:56,758
I mean, look at you.

542
00:29:56,794 --> 00:29:59,266
You're pathetic...

543
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,935
a confused child trying
to live up to a legacy

544
00:30:02,977 --> 00:30:04,344
left by her predecessors.

545
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,374
You're not worthy
of the name "Dax."

546
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:08,687
I knew Jadzia.

547
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:10,194
She was vital, alive.

548
00:30:10,229 --> 00:30:12,895
She owned herself, and you...

549
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:16,571
you don't even know who you are.

550
00:30:16,612 --> 00:30:19,984
How dare you presume
to help me?

551
00:30:20,021 --> 00:30:23,257
You can't even help yourself.

552
00:30:26,805 --> 00:30:28,776
Now, get out of here...

553
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:31,943
before I say something unkind.

554
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:23,813
What's this all about?

555
00:31:23,853 --> 00:31:25,345
What does it look like?

556
00:31:25,391 --> 00:31:27,362
I'm resigning from Starfleet.

557
00:31:27,396 --> 00:31:28,387
Why?

558
00:31:28,432 --> 00:31:30,494
Because I can't do my job.

559
00:31:30,537 --> 00:31:32,167
Garak was right.

560
00:31:32,209 --> 00:31:35,308
How can I help other people
when I can't even help myself?

561
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,321
I know this has been a
hard time for you old man...

562
00:31:37,355 --> 00:31:38,756
Don't call me that!

563
00:31:38,792 --> 00:31:40,284
I'm not the old man.

564
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,233
I'm not Curzon or Jadzia.

565
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:44,205
No, you're Ezri, Ezri Dax

566
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,547
and you've been given eight
lifetimes worth of experience.

567
00:31:48,584 --> 00:31:52,117
Now, I know this is confusing
for you right now, but in time

568
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,256
you'll see
it's a wonderful gift.

569
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:56,533
It's a gift I don't deserve.

570
00:31:59,914 --> 00:32:04,757
If that's the way you feel,
then go back to Trill

571
00:32:04,793 --> 00:32:07,231
talk to the Symbiosis
Commission.

572
00:32:07,266 --> 00:32:10,570
Maybe you can convince them
to take the symbiont out of you.

573
00:32:10,675 --> 00:32:13,409
I wish they could, but removing
the symbiont would kill me.

574
00:32:13,449 --> 00:32:14,782
You know that.

575
00:32:16,122 --> 00:32:19,494
Well, if you're leaving
Starfleet

576
00:32:19,531 --> 00:32:21,867
you'll have to find
something to do.

577
00:32:21,904 --> 00:32:23,898
Let's see...

578
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,471
maybe you could become
one of the people

579
00:32:26,515 --> 00:32:29,147
who take care
of the symbiont pools.

580
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,286
It's quiet in those caves

581
00:32:31,328 --> 00:32:33,492
no one around

582
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:36,633
no one expecting
great things of you.

583
00:32:36,676 --> 00:32:39,844
You could spend the rest
of your life underground

584
00:32:39,884 --> 00:32:42,652
in the dark, stirring mud.

585
00:32:42,691 --> 00:32:47,432
80 or 90 years of that just
might be what you need.

586
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:50,273
And as for Dax...

587
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:54,116
that symbiont had
eight amazing lives.

588
00:32:54,155 --> 00:32:57,391
So what if the ninth
was a waste?

589
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,899
Stop it, Benjamin.

590
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:01,633
I thought you of all people
would understand.

591
00:33:01,741 --> 00:33:04,441
I do understand,
and you were right.

592
00:33:04,481 --> 00:33:06,645
You don't deserve
the Dax symbiont.

593
00:33:06,754 --> 00:33:09,694
Quite frankly, you don't
deserve to wear that uniform.

594
00:33:10,797 --> 00:33:13,794
I'll pass this on
to Starfleet Command. Dismissed.

595
00:33:35,428 --> 00:33:36,954
Enter.

596
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:42,871
Oh, no, not again.

597
00:33:42,914 --> 00:33:44,817
Compliments of Dr. Bashir.

598
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,022
He sent you.

599
00:33:48,061 --> 00:33:49,587
No, that was my idea.

600
00:33:49,631 --> 00:33:52,263
Now, if you want
to skip the drinking

601
00:33:52,305 --> 00:33:55,507
and get right down
to the talking, I'm game.

602
00:33:55,547 --> 00:33:57,677
What is it you wish to discuss?

603
00:33:57,719 --> 00:34:00,521
Julian swears there's nothing
going on between him and Ezri.

604
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,554
There's no reason
for you to be jealous.

605
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:04,536
This has nothing
to do with jealousy.

606
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:07,442
I know that Dr. Bashir
cared for Jadzia

607
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:09,210
but this woman is not Jadzia

608
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,586
and treating her as if she were
dishonors her memory.

609
00:34:11,622 --> 00:34:12,955
Wrong.

610
00:34:12,993 --> 00:34:14,759
Treating Ezri

611
00:34:14,864 --> 00:34:17,234
like a stranger
dishonors Jadzia's memory.

612
00:34:18,373 --> 00:34:20,607
It doesn't make any sense.

613
00:34:20,646 --> 00:34:24,315
She is not Jadzia, yet she is.

614
00:34:24,355 --> 00:34:26,793
How can I honor the memory
of the woman I loved

615
00:34:26,828 --> 00:34:28,526
when she is not really dead?

616
00:34:28,565 --> 00:34:30,468
I don't have an answer
for you, Worf.

617
00:34:30,505 --> 00:34:32,807
But let me ask you this:

618
00:34:32,877 --> 00:34:36,512
How do you think Jadzia
would want you to treat Ezri?

619
00:34:36,553 --> 00:34:38,456
There's no way to know.

620
00:34:38,491 --> 00:34:41,590
Yes, there is,
and the person who can tell you

621
00:34:41,633 --> 00:34:43,263
is the person
you've been avoiding

622
00:34:43,304 --> 00:34:44,534
ever since she got here.

623
00:34:58,477 --> 00:35:02,078
Well, I didn't think you'd
darken my doorstep again.

624
00:35:03,356 --> 00:35:05,692
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

625
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:08,065
I wish I'd been able
to help you.

626
00:35:09,138 --> 00:35:10,402
So do I.

627
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:14,213
Well, you don't have to worry
about me bothering you anymore.

628
00:35:14,251 --> 00:35:15,846
I'll be leaving in the morning.

629
00:35:15,955 --> 00:35:17,151
Yes. I had heard

630
00:35:17,192 --> 00:35:19,426
that the <i>Destiny</i>
was going to arrive tomorrow.

631
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:20,627
They're putting in

632
00:35:20,668 --> 00:35:22,970
for supplies
before they head to the front

633
00:35:23,007 --> 00:35:24,875
but I won't be going with them.

634
00:35:24,945 --> 00:35:27,075
I've decided
to go back to Trill.

635
00:35:28,722 --> 00:35:29,691
How nice for you.

636
00:35:29,724 --> 00:35:32,094
Actually, the <i>Destiny's</i>

637
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:34,433
going to be joining
the Seventh Fleet at Kalandra.

638
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:37,806
Kalandra?

639
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:39,612
Those transmissions
you decoded last week

640
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:40,914
must have convinced Starfleet

641
00:35:40,954 --> 00:35:43,118
that it's a good place
to launch a new offensive.

642
00:35:44,262 --> 00:35:47,259
Yes, the transmissions
did indicate

643
00:35:47,303 --> 00:35:50,209
that it was
somewhat vulnerable.

644
00:35:50,245 --> 00:35:51,805
If the offensive goes well

645
00:35:51,848 --> 00:35:53,546
Starfleet will have
you to thank for it.

646
00:35:53,586 --> 00:35:55,922
Well, that's most gratifying.

647
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:58,227
I just thought you should know.

648
00:36:03,345 --> 00:36:04,712
Are you all right?

649
00:36:04,749 --> 00:36:05,740
Yes, of course, I'm all right.

650
00:36:05,785 --> 00:36:08,850
That's very good news
about Kalandra.

651
00:36:12,135 --> 00:36:14,369
Let's hope it goes well.

652
00:36:14,407 --> 00:36:17,745
The Cardassians will put up
a strong fight.

653
00:36:17,783 --> 00:36:22,888
Oh, indeed they will,
but in the end, they'll lose.

654
00:36:22,929 --> 00:36:24,923
How can you be so sure?

655
00:36:24,968 --> 00:36:27,600
Because they won't be
expecting an attack.

656
00:36:27,642 --> 00:36:32,883
Because they have no idea
that I broke their code.

657
00:36:32,922 --> 00:36:37,161
All those Cardassians are going
to die because of me.

658
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,638
I suppose that's one way
of looking at it.

659
00:36:39,673 --> 00:36:41,268
What other way is there?

660
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:43,874
That by helping to end the war,
you'll be saving lives.

661
00:36:44,008 --> 00:36:47,039
Saving lives? And what lives
would I be saving?

662
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:49,817
Human? Klingon? Romulan?

663
00:36:49,856 --> 00:36:51,759
And Cardassian.

664
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:54,199
No, not Cardassians!

665
00:36:54,234 --> 00:36:56,330
They're going to fight
to the bitter end.

666
00:36:56,374 --> 00:36:58,004
The Dominion will see to that.

667
00:36:58,044 --> 00:36:59,138
Don't you understand?

668
00:36:59,181 --> 00:37:00,480
Don't you see?

669
00:37:00,517 --> 00:37:01,781
I wanted to believe

670
00:37:01,821 --> 00:37:05,354
that I was helping my people,
liberating them

671
00:37:05,397 --> 00:37:11,869
but all I've done is to pave
the way for their annihilation.

672
00:37:13,651 --> 00:37:15,885
I'm a traitor.

673
00:37:15,924 --> 00:37:21,269
I've... betrayed...

674
00:37:21,304 --> 00:37:23,538
everything!

675
00:37:27,688 --> 00:37:28,782
Dax to Infirmary.

676
00:37:28,824 --> 00:37:30,316
I need a medical team.

677
00:37:38,984 --> 00:37:40,453
How are you feeling?

678
00:37:40,488 --> 00:37:43,929
Well, I'm breathing
much better now.

679
00:37:43,964 --> 00:37:46,459
At least we found out
what's been triggering

680
00:37:46,504 --> 00:37:49,068
these claustrophobic attacks
you've been having.

681
00:37:50,915 --> 00:37:53,319
You know, when I first
agreed to help Starfleet

682
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:57,765
I was... convinced
it was the right thing to do.

683
00:37:57,833 --> 00:38:00,135
I didn't allow myself
to doubt it

684
00:38:00,172 --> 00:38:02,166
even for an instant.

685
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:07,588
I never realized
how much it was gnawing at me.

686
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:11,089
I suppose
I was looking for a way out

687
00:38:11,134 --> 00:38:13,538
and the claustrophobia
gave me an excuse

688
00:38:13,574 --> 00:38:16,571
to stop fighting my people.

689
00:38:16,615 --> 00:38:19,053
Now that you know that,
what are you going to do?

690
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,421
Get back to work.

691
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:21,927
What else can I do?

692
00:38:21,962 --> 00:38:25,130
The Dominion must be stopped

693
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:29,044
even if it does mean
the destruction of Cardassia.

694
00:38:29,081 --> 00:38:32,214
The Captain will be glad to hear
that you're back on the job.

695
00:38:32,256 --> 00:38:36,323
Well, he has you
to thank for it.

696
00:38:36,366 --> 00:38:38,634
And so do I.

697
00:38:41,045 --> 00:38:42,480
And what about you?

698
00:38:42,515 --> 00:38:45,546
Are you still planning
to go back to Trill?

699
00:38:48,197 --> 00:38:52,607
No. I'm going
to stay in Starfleet.

700
00:38:52,642 --> 00:38:56,881
Well, I'm sure the Captain will
be glad to hear that as well.

701
00:38:58,991 --> 00:39:00,221
The Captain.

702
00:39:00,261 --> 00:39:01,787
Oh...

703
00:39:01,832 --> 00:39:03,735
What now?

704
00:39:03,771 --> 00:39:06,073
It's my request to be
reinstated into Starfleet.

705
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,480
I can't send this
to Starfleet Command.

706
00:39:08,517 --> 00:39:10,385
Why not?

707
00:39:10,422 --> 00:39:13,453
Because I never submitted
your resignation.

708
00:39:15,535 --> 00:39:19,341
I had a feeling you didn't mean
all those things you said to me.

709
00:39:19,378 --> 00:39:22,284
You were just trying
to rattle my cage.

710
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:24,791
You've done it to me
often enough.

711
00:39:24,826 --> 00:39:26,295
I'm glad it worked.

712
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:28,631
Mr. Garak has asked

713
00:39:28,669 --> 00:39:30,697
for the latest
Cardassian transmissions

714
00:39:30,741 --> 00:39:32,233
to be sent to the Infirmary.

715
00:39:32,278 --> 00:39:33,611
Well done.

716
00:39:33,648 --> 00:39:34,981
Thanks.

717
00:39:36,723 --> 00:39:38,353
Somehow I thought
you'd be happier

718
00:39:38,394 --> 00:39:39,886
that I was staying in Starfleet.

719
00:39:39,965 --> 00:39:43,737
I'd be happier if you would
stay here at DS9.

720
00:39:43,775 --> 00:39:46,373
Me, too

721
00:39:46,415 --> 00:39:47,941
but you know I can't.

722
00:39:50,926 --> 00:39:54,595
I hope Captain Raymer
knows how lucky she is.

723
00:39:54,636 --> 00:39:57,633
She's getting
one hell of a counselor.

724
00:40:04,628 --> 00:40:05,619
Yes.

725
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:12,273
May I come in?

726
00:40:12,316 --> 00:40:13,980
Of course.

727
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,003
I understand that you are
leaving in the morning.

728
00:40:22,107 --> 00:40:23,907
That's right.

729
00:40:29,192 --> 00:40:31,630
I am not certain
that I have treated you

730
00:40:31,665 --> 00:40:34,035
the way that Jadzia
would have wanted.

731
00:40:35,543 --> 00:40:37,913
You'll get no argument
from me there.

732
00:40:48,008 --> 00:40:51,677
I loved her with all my heart.

733
00:40:57,031 --> 00:40:59,697
And she loved you.

734
00:41:06,222 --> 00:41:12,330
Part of me is glad to know
that she is not gone forever

735
00:41:12,371 --> 00:41:18,046
but, in some ways, it would
be easier if she were.

736
00:41:18,086 --> 00:41:19,578
I know.

737
00:41:24,101 --> 00:41:25,434
I heard that the Captain

738
00:41:25,471 --> 00:41:27,909
offered you a position
as Station Counselor.

739
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:29,208
I...

740
00:41:29,248 --> 00:41:32,620
I would not want you
to decline on my account.

741
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:35,255
Worf, I can't stay.

742
00:41:35,297 --> 00:41:37,131
I couldn't do that to you.

743
00:41:37,169 --> 00:41:39,869
Do you wish to stay?

744
00:41:42,148 --> 00:41:44,051
Very much.

745
00:41:44,087 --> 00:41:45,955
Then do.

746
00:41:45,991 --> 00:41:50,868
Jadzia would not have wanted you
to leave because of me.

747
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:54,576
Thank you.

748
00:42:01,799 --> 00:42:04,101
It will be a long time

749
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:08,104
before I can accept
what has happened.

750
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,984
Until then...

751
00:42:12,661 --> 00:42:16,296
You need your breathing room.

752
00:42:16,337 --> 00:42:17,806
I understand.

753
00:42:36,255 --> 00:42:38,454
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

754
00:42:41,469 --> 00:42:43,668
I want you to take
a good look around.

755
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:45,872
You have just agreed
to take responsibility

756
00:42:45,914 --> 00:42:48,182
for the mental health
of everyone in this room.

757
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:51,285
You have your work
cut out for you.

758
00:42:52,497 --> 00:42:53,898
Well, I'm glad
they made you a Lieutenant.

759
00:42:53,935 --> 00:42:56,271
It would have been hard
taking advice from an Ensign.

760
00:42:56,341 --> 00:42:58,107
Since when did you
take advice from anyone?

761
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,356
Why don't you join us
for dinner tonight?

762
00:43:03,393 --> 00:43:05,091
I don't want to put you out.

763
00:43:05,131 --> 00:43:07,227
Oh, no, please come.
It'll take the pressure off me.

764
00:43:07,269 --> 00:43:09,605
All he does is sit there
and count how many times I chew.

765
00:43:09,642 --> 00:43:11,510
I'll be there.

766
00:43:20,637 --> 00:43:22,197
She is cute.

767
00:43:22,241 --> 00:43:25,147
She is also about 300 years
too old for you.

768
00:43:26,486 --> 00:43:29,824
I took the liberty of putting
a plate together for you.

769
00:43:29,861 --> 00:43:31,832
Thanks, Quark.

770
00:43:31,866 --> 00:43:33,928
Uh, Worf isn't here, is he?

771
00:43:35,676 --> 00:43:37,476
Good question.
Excuse me.

772
00:43:38,717 --> 00:43:41,885
It's, uh, quite a nice turnout.

773
00:43:41,925 --> 00:43:43,224
Congratulations.

774
00:43:43,263 --> 00:43:45,257
Oh, I hope it isn't
too crowded for you.

775
00:43:45,301 --> 00:43:46,565
Oh, not at all.
