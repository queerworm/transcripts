1
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:08,676
It's funny...
before yesterday,

2
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:11,136
I'd never set foot
on this station, but...

3
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,848
it's as familiar to me
as the back of my hand.

4
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,225
Isn't that odd?

5
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,773
You have no idea
who I am, do you?

6
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,985
I didn't think so.

7
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,697
Thanks for
listening, anyway.

8
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,241
(<i> sighs</i> )

9
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,716
I was killed here.

10
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,219
I mean, Jadzia was.

11
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:41,184
I try not to think about that.

12
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:45,272
If I did, I'm not sure
that I could come back here.

13
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,527
It's a strange sensation--
dying.

14
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,488
No matter how
many times it
happens to you,

15
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,240
you never get used to it.

16
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,413
It must be
a little disconcerting for you

17
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:04,792
knowing that I have
Jadzia's memories.

18
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,086
No wonder you're uncomfortable.

19
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,338
It's a lot to get used to.

20
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,716
Tell me about it.

21
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,510
Well...

22
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,430
I'll let you get
to your prayers.

23
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,365
Bloodwine.

24
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,200
That's the good stuff.
The same vintage I served

25
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,161
when you and Worf
got married.

26
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,456
It smells awful.

27
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,749
Ah...

28
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,584
it used to be your favorite.

29
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,420
I used to be
right-handed, too.

30
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,715
A lot of things
have changed
since I was joined.

31
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,342
I can imagine.

32
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,303
Seven lifetimes worth
of memories

33
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,472
would mix up anyone.

34
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:01,932
Or is it eight?

35
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,642
Who knows anymore?

36
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,686
It will be
a lot easier
once you get settled in.

37
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,771
Have you picked out
your quarters yet?

38
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:12,442
I'm not staying.
I'm going back to the<i> Destiny</i>

39
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,903
to be an Assistant Counselor.
You're a therapist?

40
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:18,365
Why does everyone
sound so surprised
when they hear that?

41
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,450
Oh, it's just, uh...

42
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,537
you're so young.

43
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,875
Why are you in such a hurry
to leave?

44
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:31,336
Why not stay for awhile
and get to know your
old friends again?

45
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,964
I don't want to force things.

46
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:37,051
People need time to get over
losing Jadzia.

47
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,510
Mm-hmm.

48
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,345
You know
something, Quark?

49
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,389
Besides Benjamin, you're
the only one of Jadzia's friends

50
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,599
who doesn't seem
uncomfortable around me.

51
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,351
She and I were close.

52
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:50,438
I don't see any reason
why we shouldn't be close, too.

53
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:54,193
Remember all those
late night<i> tongo</i> games?

54
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:55,777
Who could forget?

55
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,362
Hmm.

56
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,489
Wait a minute.

57
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,367
You owe me ten
strips of latinum
from our last game.

58
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,119
I don't think so.

59
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,454
Yes. I won with a full
consortium. I remember.

60
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,582
Your memory's playing
tricks on you.

61
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:12,502
Don't say that, Quark.
I'm confused enough as it is.

62
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,004
Look who's here.

63
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,056
I bet the two of you
have a lot to talk about.

64
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,892
(<i> door chimes</i> )

65
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,810
Come in.

66
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,152
(<i> door chimes</i> )

67
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,655
(<i> door chimes</i> )

68
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,459
Dax.

69
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,502
Are you alone?

70
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,923
Why are you
sneaking in this way?

71
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,675
I didn't want
to go through Ops

72
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,468
in case Worf was there.

73
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:11,098
We bumped into each other
last night at Quark's.

74
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,308
It didn't go well,
I take it.

75
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,228
You weren't expecting him

76
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:18,021
to accept you right away,
were you?

77
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:21,024
Of course not,
but he wouldn't
even talk to me.

78
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:24,319
Well, perhaps he was just
trying to honor your customs.

79
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,239
He knows that
the joined Trill aren't
supposed to get involved

80
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,199
with people who were married
to their previous hosts.

81
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,410
But that doesn't
mean that we can't
talk to each other.

82
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,828
Worf knows that.
Are you sure?

83
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,914
I told him all about
Trill traditions--

84
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,832
Jadzia did.
We discussed them--

85
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,418
<i>they</i>
discussed them.

86
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,002
I understand.

87
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,422
These pronouns are going
to drive me crazy.

88
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,010
Look at him,
Benjamin.

89
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,220
He's in pain.

90
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,598
How can you tell?

91
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,683
I was his wife.

92
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,269
I can tell.

93
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,648
I don't want to
put him through
any more heartache

94
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,401
than he's already
going through.

95
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,279
It's a good thing
I'm going back
to the<i> Destiny.</i>

96
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,829
You're still planning
on leaving?

97
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,123
I can't stay here.

98
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,625
I couldn't do that to him.

99
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,504
Besides, I think it might be
easier for me on the<i> Destiny.</i>

100
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,007
There are
too many memories here.

101
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,304
I'm going to miss you,
old man.

102
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:37,100
I'm going to miss you, too,
Benjamin.

103
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,313
If you feel that strongly,
Miles, it's all right.

104
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,523
You can be Crockett.
I'll be Travis.

105
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,484
And, and who am I
going to be again?

106
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:47,861
General Santa Anna.
Santa Anna.

107
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,405
When can our
costumes be ready?

108
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,573
Garak?
Hmm?

109
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,659
Our holosuite costumes?
When can they be ready?

110
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,162
Oh, I'm afraid you're going
to have to find them
from somewhere else.

111
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,414
The shop's closed.
Still?

112
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:02,876
Well, Starfleet Intelligence
is keeping me quite busy
these days.

113
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,586
Well, what if we let
you be Crockett?
Hey!

114
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,381
GARAK:
Even if I was
interested,

115
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,716
I don't have the time.
Do you have any idea

116
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,886
how long it takes to decode
a Cardassian military
transmission?

117
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:16,556
I mean, I invented
some of the basic
encryption protocols

118
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,183
when I was with Obsidian Order,

119
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,851
but it still takes me
several days

120
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:22,270
to decipher
the simplest sentence.

121
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,897
You've got to take
a break sometime.

122
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,899
Well, I intend to...
just as soon

123
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,360
as the Dominion is driven
off Cardassia.

124
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,820
Must you stand so close?!

125
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,074
That was a bit harsh.

126
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:37,827
Well, I don't like people
looming over me.

127
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,872
I have to get
back to work.

128
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,208
Thank you for your company,
gentlemen.

129
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,266
(<i> heartbeat thudding</i> )

130
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,184

(<i> no audio</i> )

143
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,650
I can't... breathe.

(<i> groans</i> )

145
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,529
Garak!
Odo to the Infirmary.

146
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,364
We have a medical
emergency.

147
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,907
Garak?

148
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,705
He had a claustrophobic attack
in his shop.

149
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,250
His shop?
I don't understand.

150
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,085
That's a
good-sized space.

151
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,421
I know. I've been
claustrophobic

152
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,423
for as long as
I can remember,

153
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,467
but lately,
it seems to have gotten worse.

154
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:19,053
Rooms that I once found
completely tolerable

155
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:23,475
now suddenly feel
alarmingly... cramped.

156
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:24,934
Well, I wish I had
an explanation,

157
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,436
but I don't.

158
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,979
He checks out fine.

159
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,273
Well, I don't
<i>feel</i> fine.

160
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,275
Would you gentlemen
mind terribly

161
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:35,612
if we continued
this conversation
on the Promenade?

162
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,535
(<i> sighs</i> )

163
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,162
Better?
A little.

164
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,540
Mr. Garak, as much
as I appreciate
your situation,

165
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,749
I'm not sure why
you asked to see me.

166
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,751
I was hoping you'd
be kind enough

167
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,296
to express my regrets to
Starfleet Intelligence.

168
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:56,757
When I get this way,
my concentration isn't
what it should be.

169
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,177
I'm afraid I
won't be decoding

170
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,179
any transmissions
for awhile.

171
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,682
Can I tell them
when to expect you
back on the job?

172
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:05,016
I wish I could say.

173
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,518
Believe me,

174
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,603
I'm not happy
about this, either.

175
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,897
I want to see an
end to this war

176
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,024
just as much as you.

177
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,942
And, now, if
you'll excuse me,

178
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,654
I'm going to
hem some pants.

179
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:21,824
For some reason, sewing
seems to calm me down.

180
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,873
Sewing?

181
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,876
We can't afford
to lose Mr. Garak right now.

182
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,254
Is there anything
<i>you</i> can do for him?

183
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:38,425
Well, to be blunt,
our friend Garak
needs his head examined.

184
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,096
Me? You want<i> me</i> to work
with Garak?

185
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,265
SISKO:
You're a counselor,
aren't you?

186
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,559
Assistant counselor.
I'm still in training.

187
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,768
Oh, come on, Dax,
what are you going
to learn

188
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:52,188
in the next few months
that you haven't
already learned

189
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,315
in the last 300 years?

190
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,360
Oh, how to keep
from breaking into tears
for no reason,

191
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,779
how to resist the urge
to stand on my head...
things like that.

192
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,950
Why<i> are</i> you standing
on your head,
by the way?

193
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,578
Emony used to do it.
The gymnast.

194
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,413
She found it relaxing.

195
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:09,830
Do you?

196
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,791
Actually, it's giving me
a headache.

197
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,588
(<i> sighs</i> )

198
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,673
Why can't Julian
work with Garak?

199
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:21,092
Oh, Julian's a good doctor,
but he's no counselor--

200
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:22,843
not even an
assistant counselor--

201
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,638
and besides,
he doesn't have

202
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:27,307
eight lifetimes' worth
of experience under his belt.

203
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,101
I bet he doesn't
stand on his head
for no reason, either.

204
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:35,022
That's a good point.
Oh, come on, old man,
you can do this.

205
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,651
All right.

206
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,611
I'll<i> try.</i>

207
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:42,405
I just wish I had as much
confidence in me as you do.

208
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,577
So, what do you think?
About what?

209
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,454
About her.
About who?

210
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,122
Dax.

211
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,957
Oh, Ezri.

212
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,084
She seems... nice.

213
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,294
Meaning what?

214
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,962
Meaning... nice.

215
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,506
Oh, come on, Doctor.

216
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,424
I know the way you felt
about Jadzia.

217
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:02,759
But she's
not Jadzia.

218
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,552
She's the next best thing.

219
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,348
So... are you
interested?

220
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,017
Sounds to me like
you're the one who's
interested, Quark.

221
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,478
It's not every day
you get a second chance
with a woman.

222
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,146
It's not the
same woman.

223
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,774
She's still Dax,
isn't she?

224
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,442
More or less.

225
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,110
Well, that's good
enough for me.

226
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,112
Ready for a little
competition?

227
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,532
You're insane.

228
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,283
And you...

229
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,285
(<i> whispering</i> ):
are going to lose.

230
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,749
EZRI:
Am I interrupting?

231
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,543
Ah...

232
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,962
You must be Ezri Dax.

233
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:43,049
The Captain told me
that you'd be dropping by

234
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,843
to<i> counsel</i> me.

235
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:46,845
Is that all right?

236
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:49,556
Well, it all depends
on what it involves.

237
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:52,225
I'm a very private person,
you know.

238
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,518
I understand.

239
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,688
So, is it helping?

240
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,940
The sewing...

241
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,776
is it making you
feel better?

242
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,944
Thankfully... yes.

243
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,239
You're lucky.
Nothing helps me.

244
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,949
Are you claustrophobic, too?

245
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,661
Why would you say that?

246
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,747
You just said...

247
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,916
No. I get spacesick...

248
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,668
ever since I was joined.

249
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,003
I'm very sensitive
to motion.

250
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,798
I can even feel the
station spinning.
Really?

251
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,551
It's because of what
happened to Torias.

252
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,803
He was killed in
a shuttle accident.

253
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:32,056
But why would<i> that</i>
make you spacesick?

254
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,267
Because I blame myself
for what happened.

255
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:37,311
You were piloting.
Yes. No.

256
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,814
Depends on
how you look at it.

257
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,567
Torias was my fifth host.
Didn't I say that?

258
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,944
Uh, no.
Well, he was,

259
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,739
and I think the reason
that his death has stayed
with me for so long

260
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:52,452
is because I just
can't seem to forgive him
for getting himself killed.

261
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,704
But you said it was an accident.

262
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:58,374
So, if he's not to blame,
then you're not
to blame, either.

263
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:02,712
I know, but somehow
I can't help but
punish myself for it.

264
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,298
By getting... spacesick.

265
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,216
Exactly.

266
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,260
Don't take this
the wrong way,

267
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,554
but it sounds to me
as if<i> you're</i> the one

268
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,473
who needs to see
a counselor.

269
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,016
You're probably right...

270
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:19,145
but I didn't come here
to talk about myself.

271
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,063
I came to talk about you.

272
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,857
So you did.

273
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,445
Do you remember
anything traumatic

274
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,405
happening to you
when you were young...

275
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,492
something involving
being trapped in
a confined space?

276
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,452
If I had been
that careless,

277
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,371
my father would have
left me there to
teach me a lesson.

278
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:40,834
Sounds like
he was strict.

279
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:44,003
He didn't get to be head
of the Obsidian Order

280
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,006
without a sense
of discipline.

281
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,883
Did he discipline you?

282
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,594
He punished me
when I misbehaved.

283
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,680
What father wouldn't?

284
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,849
Tobin.
Who?

285
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:57,725
My second host.

286
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,811
He could not bring himself
to discipline his children

287
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,980
no matter
<i>what</i> they did...

288
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,691
but... that's
another story.

289
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,485
How did you say that
your father punished you?

290
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,863
He'd lock me in a closet.

291
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,072
Why didn't you mention that
when I asked

292
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,450
if you'd ever been trapped
in a confined space?

293
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,285
I wasn't trapped.

294
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,205
I knew he'd let me out
as soon as I learned my lesson.

295
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,165
Learned your lesson?

296
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,376
Did you think you deserved
to be locked in that closet?

297
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,086
I could be very stubborn.

298
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,506
You blame yourself...

299
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:32,760
just like I blame myself
for that shuttle accident.

300
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,179
Maybe you get claustrophobic

301
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,932
for the same reason
that I get spacesick.

302
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:41,853
We're both punishing ourselves
for things that weren't
our fault.

303
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:45,231
That's it!
Don't you see?

304
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:48,985
We both have to let go
of all this misplaced guilt.

305
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:52,780
And if we do, our problems
will simply disappear?

306
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,367
Well, not overnight, but it's
a step in the right direction.

307
00:17:56,367 --> 00:18:00,747
Well, I'll certainly
give your advice some thought.

308
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,582
Me, too.

309
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,465
(<i> slowly exhaling</i> )
Are you all right?

310
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:15,887
To tell the truth,
I'm starting to feel
a little claustrophobic.

311
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:19,098
Probably because we've
been talking about it.

312
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,268
Actually, I'm starting
to feel a little
spacesick myself.

313
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,978
If it's all
the same to you,

314
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,480
I think I'll go back
to my sewing.

315
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,899
Good idea.

316
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:30,150
Thank you
for stopping by.

317
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,569
My pleasure.

318
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,133
(<i> groans softly</i> )

319
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,551
Ooh...

320
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,184
Hello, Worf.

321
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,771
Ensign.

322
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,315
"Ensign"?

323
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,275
That's all you have
to say to me?

324
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,527
What more is
there to say?

325
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,947
I was your wife.

326
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:17,949
You are<i> not</i> Jadzia.

327
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:19,742
Jadzia died and
went to<i> Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

328
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,452
I do not know you...

329
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,496
nor do I wish
to know you.

330
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:40,096
(<i> door chimes</i> )

331
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,555
Come in.

332
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,689
Dax?

333
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,068
Do you think the Chief could
adjust the inertial dampers

334
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:57,113
so that the station would
spin a little slower?

335
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,406
I don't know. Why?

336
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,242
(<i> sighing</i> ):
Never mind.

337
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:06,039
To what do I owe the pleasure?

338
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,833
I'm not going to say
"I told you so",

339
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,044
but Garak stopped by
Odo's office this morning

340
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,504
to pick up the latest
Cardassian transmissions

341
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,339
for decoding.
Really?

342
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,718
It looks like Garak's
claustrophobia is under control.

343
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,553
Huh.

344
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,556
I guess our talk helped him.
I told you so.

345
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,517
I thought you weren't going
to say that.

346
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,144
I couldn't resist.

347
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,608
Are you all right?

348
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,238
I talked with Worf.

349
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,324
He doesn't want to have
anything to do with me.

350
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,745
Perhaps I should have
a talk with him.

351
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,956
Absolutely not.
You intimidate him.

352
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:52,085
Me?
Don't tell him I told you.

353
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:57,339
(<i> laughing</i> ):
<i>I</i> intimidate Worf, huh?

354
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,092
You like that, don't you?

355
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,885
Of course not.

356
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:04,346
Come on.
I've been a man, I know.

357
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,682
Look, we're not talking
about me and Worf,

358
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,809
we're talking
about you and Worf.

359
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,645
Now, I sympathize
with what he's going through,

360
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,522
but as far as I'm concerned,

361
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,192
you have as much right
to be here as he does.

362
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,111
What are you getting at,
Benjamin?

363
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,864
The war...

364
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:25,910
has certainly not been very good
for morale around here.

365
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,745
I've been thinking...

366
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:30,330
the station could use
a good counselor.

367
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,500
I can't think of anyone
better suited for the job.

368
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,838
Thanks for saying that, but even
if Worf wasn't an issue,

369
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,466
I'm still just an
assistant counselor.

370
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:43,343
I took the liberty
of talking to
Starfleet Medical,

371
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:46,180
and they're willing to waive
the rest of your training

372
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,515
and give you a commission
as a full counselor

373
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,350
with the rank of Lieutenant.

374
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,687
How'd you talk them into that?

375
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,606
I asked them what
they thought you might learn

376
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,357
in the next few months--

377
00:21:57,357 --> 00:22:00,486
That I haven't already learned
in the last 300 years.

378
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,363
They saw my point.
I hope you do, too.

379
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:06,075
(<i> sighing</i> ):
It means a lot to me

380
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:09,369
that you want me to stay,
but I can't.

381
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,746
Because of Worf?

382
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,873
Hmm... mostly.

383
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,837
Well... you just say the word,

384
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:21,090
and I will
intimidate him for you.

385
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:24,343
(<i> laughing</i> )

386
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,349
I'danian spice pudding.

387
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,186
No, cancel that.

388
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:35,313
I'll have a...

389
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:37,481
kilm steak, rare.

390
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,860
No. Tobin was a vegetarian.

391
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,153
(<i> sighing</i> )

392
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:43,445
Give me...

393
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,698
Two Fanalian
toddies...

394
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,493
hot.

395
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,537
How'd you know?

396
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,123
Lucky guess.

397
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:57,417
Care to join me?
Sure.

398
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,058
So, um...

399
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,934
here we are.

400
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:22,526
What was that?

401
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,737
What was what?
That look.

402
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:29,783
This might be
the last thing you want
to hear, but, uh...

403
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,744
you have Jadzia's eyes.

404
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,291
I'm sorry. I, um...

405
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,876
I shouldn't have said anything.

406
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:41,461
Don't flirt with me, Julian.
Please?

407
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:44,798
I'm not.
I remember how you used
to flirt with Jadzia.

408
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,051
I... it was just an observation.

409
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,511
Good, because I'm not like her.

410
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,805
She knew how to handle it.

411
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,974
Actually, she quite enjoyed it.

412
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,268
Really?

413
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:57,395
You didn't know?

414
00:23:57,395 --> 00:24:01,065
Well, I-I... I always suspected.

415
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:03,901
You can be very charming.

416
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:07,321
You want to
know something?

417
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:11,158
If Worf hadn't come along,
it would've been you.

418
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:24,130
You really miss her,
don't you?

419
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:27,674
Yes.

420
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:32,430
I, uh...
I suppose I always will,

421
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:37,351
but, uh, somehow,
talking to you... seems to help.

422
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:47,069
Deputy Talpet to Dr. Bashir.
Go ahead.

423
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,238
We have a medical emergency
in Airlock 7.

424
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,656
It's Garak, sir.

425
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,533
I'm on my way.

426
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,577
He's down
there, Doctor.

427
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:02,668
Garak!

428
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,086
What is he
doing in there?

429
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,796
(<i> grunting</i> )

430
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,547
Garak, open the door!

431
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,426
(<i> whispering</i> ):
Let me out.

432
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:11,760
Let me out.

433
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,275
(<i> birds calling</i> )

434
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:27,651
EZRI:
Breathe in...

435
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,863
and out.

436
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,448
In...

437
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:36,369
and out.

438
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:42,458
Better?

439
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:49,048
Hmm... it's beautiful,
isn't it?

440
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:53,093
Look at that sky.
It just goes on and on.

441
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,929
But it doesn't.
It's an illusion.

442
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:59,350
There's a holosuite
wall not ten meters
in front of us.

443
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,934
But you can't see it.

444
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,145
I can feel it.

445
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,980
We could call up
another program.

446
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,566
I can't believe
the way I humiliated
myself back there.

447
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:11,611
I just... wanted
to get out.

448
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,822
I couldn't breathe.

449
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,657
Well, if you were looking
for fresh air,

450
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,743
you sure were knocking
on the wrong door.

451
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:20,162
I have to get this
situation under control.

452
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:22,415
If I can't, I'll be forced
to leave the station

453
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:25,918
and then where will I go?
I can't go back
to Cardassia.

454
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,670
I doubt if I'd be
welcome on... Bajor.

455
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,006
You're not going to have
to leave the station.

456
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,094
I'll talk to Quark
and tell him to leave

457
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,763
this holosuite available
to you 26 hours a day.

458
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,723
So the next time
you feel like jumping

459
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,809
out the nearest airlock--
come here instead.

460
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:47,022
It's going to be
all right.

461
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,483
We're going to get this
under control.

462
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:51,026
I promise.

463
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,281
If you don't mind,
I'd like to sit here

464
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,783
and be alone for a while.

465
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:00,536
I'll come and check in
on you later.

466
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,636
(<i> shrieking</i> )

467
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:20,889
Hold still.
(<i> yells</i> )

468
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,640
I think I've got something.

469
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,731
I knew it.

470
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,776
Never get a tympanic tickle
from an amateur.

471
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,403
A tympanic tickle?
Yeah. It's--

472
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,489
Never mind.
Uh, I don't want to know.

473
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:39,241
Hold still.
I'm going to get you
some antibiotics.

474
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:40,700
(<i> sighing</i> )

475
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,876
We need to talk.
About what?

476
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,295
(<i> grunting</i> )

477
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:52,921
Do not toy with me, Doctor.

478
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,382
I know how you
felt about Jadzia.

479
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,384
That was a long time ago.

480
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,553
I saw you with her.

481
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:00,804
Jadzia?

482
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,056
You know who I'm
talking about.

483
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,350
No, you've got it all wrong.

484
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,893
Stay away from her.

485
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:09,855
Now, wait just a minute.
You...

486
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:13,192
you have no right to tell me
who I can be friends with.

487
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:17,070
If you dishonor
Jadzia's memory...

488
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,239
you<i> will</i> regret it.

489
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:26,704
And that goes for you, too,
Ferengi.

490
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,625
What did<i> I</i> do?

491
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,806
(<i> clattering and thumping</i> )

492
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:49,936
Garak?

493
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,813
(<i> grunting</i> )

494
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:58,237
I thought you were going
to stay in the holosuite
for a while.

495
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,864
I got tired of staring
at a fake landscape,

496
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,658
pretending
I was outside.

497
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:05,118
No, no, no. Work
is the answer.

498
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,037
My father always
used to say

499
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:09,748
that people should
throw themselves
into their work.

500
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,917
"Do your chores, Elim.

501
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,503
I told you to do
your chores."

502
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,963
And if you didn't,
what would he do to you?

503
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,007
Oh, no, no, no.
Please, don't start.

504
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,760
Spare me your
insipid psychobabble.

505
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,012
I'm not some
quivering neurotic

506
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:27,433
who feels sorry for himself
because his daddy wasn't nice.

507
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:30,977
You couldn't begin
to understand me.

508
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,522
I'd like to try.

509
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:34,940
Oh, I'm sure
you would.

510
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,400
You'd like
nothing more

511
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,736
than to pry into
my personal affairs.

512
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:42,030
Well, I'm not interested
in dissecting my childhood.

513
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,117
I only want to save my people
from the Dominion.

514
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:48,078
I don't need someone to walk
in here and hold my hand.

515
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:51,248
I want someone
to help me get back to work.

516
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:55,335
And you, my dear,
are not up to this task.

517
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:59,172
I mean, look at you.
You're pathetic--

518
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:03,636
a confused child trying
to live up to a legacy
left by her predecessors.

519
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:06,472
You're not worthy
of the name "Dax."

520
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:08,599
I knew Jadzia.

521
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,476
She was vital, alive.

522
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:13,019
She<i> owned</i> herself,
and you...

523
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:16,940
you don't even know who you are.

524
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,152
How dare you presume
to help me?

525
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:23,322
You can't even help yourself.

526
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,994
Now, get out of here...

527
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:32,080
before I say something unkind.

528
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,039
(<i> sobbing</i> )

529
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,757
What's this all about?

530
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:25,342
What does it look like?

531
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,135
I'm resigning from Starfleet.

532
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:30,430
Why?
Because I can't
do my job.

533
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,307
Garak was right.

534
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,143
How can I help other people
when I can't even help myself?

535
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,187
I know this has been a hard
time for you, old man--

536
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:38,980
Don't call me that!

537
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,067
I'm not the old man.
I'm not Curzon or Jadzia.

538
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,695
No, you're Ezri, Ezri Dax,

539
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:48,323
and you've been given eight
lifetimes worth of experience.

540
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,949
Now, I know this
is confusing

541
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,869
for you right now,
but in time

542
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:54,037
you'll see
it's a wonderful gift.

543
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,415
It's a gift I don't deserve.

544
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:04,673
If that's the way you feel,
then go back to Trill

545
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:07,175
talk to
the Symbiosis Commission.

546
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,429
Maybe you can convince them
to take the symbiont out of you.

547
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,306
I wish they could, but removing
the symbiont would kill me.

548
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,474
You know that.

549
00:32:15,893 --> 00:32:19,229
Well, if you're
leaving Starfleet,

550
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:21,732
you'll have to find
something to do.

551
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:23,692
Let's see...

552
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:26,194
maybe you could become
one of the people

553
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:29,030
who take care of
the symbiont pools.

554
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,116
It's quiet in those caves,

555
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,493
no one around,

556
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,455
no one expecting
great things of you.

557
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:39,750
You could spend the rest
of your life underground,

558
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,377
in the dark, stirring mud.

559
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:46,840
80 or 90 years
of that just might
be what you need.

560
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,385
And as for Dax...

561
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:54,347
that symbiont had
eight amazing lives.

562
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:57,350
So what if the
ninth was a waste?

563
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,060
Stop it, Benjamin.

564
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,396
I thought you of all people
would understand.

565
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,357
I do understand,
and you were right.

566
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,359
You don't deserve
the Dax symbiont.

567
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:10,405
Quite frankly,
you don't deserve to wear
that uniform.

568
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,575
I'll pass this on
to Starfleet Command. Dismissed.

569
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:31,635
(<i> heavy sigh</i> )

570
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,305
(<i> door chimes</i> )

571
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:36,890
Enter.

572
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:42,855
Oh, no, not again.

573
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:44,564
Compliments of Dr. Bashir.

574
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:47,734
He sent you.

575
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,194
No, that was
my idea.

576
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,864
Now, if you want
to skip the drinking

577
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:55,241
and get right down
to the talking, I'm game.

578
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,243
What is it you wish to discuss?

579
00:33:57,243 --> 00:34:00,163
Julian swears there's nothing
going on between him and Ezri.

580
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,915
There's no reason
for you to be jealous.

581
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,083
This has nothing
to do with jealousy.

582
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:07,086
I know that Dr. Bashir
cared for Jadzia,

583
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:09,130
but this woman
is not Jadzia,

584
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,925
and treating her
as if she were
dishonors her memory.

585
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:16,930
Wrong. Treating
Ezri like a stranger
dishonors Jadzia's memory.

586
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,559
It doesn't make any sense.

587
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:24,145
She is not Jadzia, yet she is.

588
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,439
How can I honor the memory
of the woman I loved

589
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,066
when she is not really dead?

590
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,360
I don't have an answer
for you, Worf.

591
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,487
But let me ask you this:

592
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:36,115
How do you think Jadzia
would want you to treat Ezri?

593
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,993
There's no way to know.

594
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:40,996
Yes, there is,
and the person who can tell you

595
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:44,207
is the person
you've been avoiding
ever since she got here.

596
00:34:57,888 --> 00:35:02,809
Well, I didn't think<i> you'd</i>
darken my doorstep again.

597
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,395
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry.

598
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:07,689
I wish I'd been able
to help you.

599
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:09,983
So do I.

600
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:12,069
Well, you don't have to worry

601
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:15,321
about me bothering you anymore.
I'll be leaving in the morning.

602
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:19,325
Yes. I had heard
that the<i> Destiny</i>  was
going to arrive tomorrow.

603
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:22,328
They're putting in
for supplies before
they head to the front,

604
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,456
but I won't be going with them.

605
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,666
I've decided
to go back to Trill.

606
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,252
How nice for you.

607
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,504
Actually,
the<i> Destiny's</i>

608
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:34,007
going to be joining
the Seventh Fleet at Kalandra.

609
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,218
Kalandra?

610
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,137
Those transmissions
you decoded last week

611
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,056
must have convinced Starfleet
that it's a good place

612
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,641
to launch a new offensive.

613
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:47,145
Yes, the transmissions
did indicate

614
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,564
that it was
somewhat vulnerable.

615
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,399
If the offensive
goes well,

616
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,068
Starfleet will have
you to thank for it.

617
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,445
Well, that's most gratifying.

618
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,739
I just thought you should know.

619
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,121
Are you all right?

620
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:05,664
Yes, of course, I'm all right.

621
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:08,374
That's very good news
about Kalandra.

622
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,172
Let's hope it goes well.

623
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,050
The Cardassians will put up
a strong fight.

624
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:22,347
Oh, indeed they will,
but in the end, they'll lose.

625
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,307
How can you be so sure?

626
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:27,894
Because they won't be
expecting an attack.

627
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:32,649
Because they have no idea
that I broke their code.

628
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:36,402
All those Cardassians are
going to die because of<i> me.</i>

629
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:40,573
I suppose that's one way
of looking at it.
What other way is there?

630
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,618
That by helping to end the war,
you'll be saving lives.

631
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,746
Saving lives? And what lives
would I be saving?

632
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,624
Human? Klingon? Romulan?

633
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,501
<i>And</i> Cardassian.

634
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:53,795
No, not Cardassians!

635
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,922
They're going to fight
to the bitter end.

636
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,675
The Dominion will see to that.
Don't you understand?

637
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:01,761
Don't you see?
I wanted to believe

638
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:05,057
that I was helping my people,
liberating them,

639
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:11,646
but all I've done
is to pave the way
for their annihilation.

640
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:16,109
I'm a traitor.

641
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:21,031
I've... betrayed...

642
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:23,282
everything!

643
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,704
(<i> ragged gasping</i> )

644
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:29,956
Dax to Infirmary.
I need a medical team.

645
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,175
How are you feeling?

646
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:44,054
Well, I'm breathing
much better now.

647
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:46,389
At least we found out
what's been triggering

648
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,683
these claustrophobic attacks
you've been having.

649
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,063
You know, when I first
agreed to help Starfleet,

650
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:57,442
I was... convinced
it was the right thing to do.

651
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,736
I didn't allow myself
to doubt it

652
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:02,822
even for an instant.

653
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:07,869
I never realized
how much it was gnawing at me.

654
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:10,705
I suppose
I was looking for a way out,

655
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:13,291
and the claustrophobia
gave me an excuse

656
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,169
to stop fighting my people.

657
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:18,671
Now that you know that,
what are you going to do?

658
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:21,549
Get back to work.
What else can I do?

659
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,636
The Dominion
must be stopped,

660
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:28,556
even if it does mean
the destruction of Cardassia.

661
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,726
The Captain will be glad to hear
that you're back on the job.

662
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:35,897
Well, he has you
to thank for it.

663
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:38,275
And so do I.

664
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,237
And what about you?

665
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:45,198
Are you still planning
to go back to Trill?

666
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:52,080
No. I'm going
to stay in Starfleet.

667
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:56,459
Well, I'm sure the Captain will
be glad to hear that as well.

668
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,380
The Captain.
Oh...

669
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,216
What now?

670
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:05,468
It's my request to be
reinstated into Starfleet.

671
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,054
I can't send this
to Starfleet Command.

672
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,806
Why not?

673
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:13,059
Because I never submitted
your resignation.

674
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:18,940
I had a feeling you didn't mean
all those things you said to me.

675
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,651
You were just trying
to rattle my cage.

676
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:24,070
You've done it to me
often enough.

677
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,780
I'm glad it worked.

678
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,074
Mr. Garak has asked

679
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,909
for the latest
Cardassian transmissions

680
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,828
to be sent to the Infirmary.

681
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:33,121
Well done.

682
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:34,413
Thanks.

683
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:39,252
Somehow I thought
you'd be happier that
I was staying in Starfleet.

684
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:43,048
I'd be happier if you would
stay here at DS9.

685
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:47,468
Me, too,
but you know I can't.

686
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:54,142
I hope Captain Raymer
knows how lucky she is.

687
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:57,145
She's getting
one hell of a counselor.

688
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,194
(<i> door chimes</i> )

689
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:05,320
Yes.

690
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:10,867
May I come in?

691
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,161
Of course.

692
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:21,419
I understand that you are
leaving in the morning.

693
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,380
That's right.

694
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,096
I am not certain
that I have treated you

695
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:33,472
the way that Jadzia
would have wanted.

696
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:37,310
You'll get no argument
from me there.

697
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:50,531
I loved her
with all my heart.

698
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,623
And she loved you.

699
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:12,095
Part of me is glad
to know that she
is not gone forever,

700
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:17,475
but, in some ways, it would
be easier if she were.

701
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,768
I know.

702
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:27,026
I heard that the Captain
offered you a position
as Station Counselor.

703
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:31,864
I... I would not want you
to decline on my account.

704
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,784
Worf, I can't stay.

705
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:36,453
I couldn't do that to you.

706
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:39,247
Do you wish to stay?

707
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,335
Very much.

708
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,462
Then do.

709
00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:50,175
Jadzia would not have wanted you
to leave because of me.

710
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,886
Thank you.

711
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,188
It will be a long time

712
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:05,690
before I can accept
what has happened.

713
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:09,277
Until then...

714
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:15,325
You need your breathing room.

715
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:17,118
I understand.

716
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:37,972
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

717
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,852
I want you to take
a good look around.

718
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:44,937
You have just agreed
to take responsibility

719
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,190
for the mental health
of everyone in this room.

720
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,774
(<i> all chuckle</i> )

721
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:51,319
You have your work
cut out for you.

722
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,363
Well, I'm glad
they made you a Lieutenant.

723
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:55,614
It would have been hard
taking advice from an Ensign.

724
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,534
Since when did you
take advice from anyone?

725
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:02,621
Why don't you join us
for dinner tonight?

726
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,499
I don't want
to put you out.

727
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:06,459
Oh, no, please come.
It'll take the pressure off me.

728
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:09,003
All he does is sit there
and count how many times I chew.

729
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,005
I'll be there.

730
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:21,724
She is cute.

731
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:25,019
She is also about 300 years
too old for you.

732
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:29,315
I took the liberty
of putting a plate
together for you.

733
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,900
Thanks, Quark.

734
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,319
Uh, Worf isn't here, is he?

735
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,655
Good question.
Excuse me.

736
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:41,035
It's, uh, quite
a nice turnout.

737
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,703
Congratulations.

738
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,456
Oh, I hope it isn't
too crowded for you.

739
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:46,040
Oh, not at all.
