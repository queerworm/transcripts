1
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:06,338
It's all right, Chief.

2
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:08,175
You're going to be just fine.

3
00:00:08,213 --> 00:00:09,341
What happened?

4
00:00:09,383 --> 00:00:11,787
You were rerouting
a phase inducer

5
00:00:11,822 --> 00:00:14,090
when one of the plasma conduits
blew out.

6
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:15,530
Oh.

7
00:00:15,565 --> 00:00:16,534
Easy there, Chief.

8
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:19,165
You've got a mild case
of radiation poisoning.

9
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,008
I'll give you some hyronalin

10
00:00:21,047 --> 00:00:22,642
which should
counteract the effects

11
00:00:22,684 --> 00:00:24,119
but I do think
he should be restricted

12
00:00:24,155 --> 00:00:25,522
to light duty
for the next few days.

13
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:27,027
Agreed.

14
00:00:27,062 --> 00:00:30,127
Commander,
the transport's arrived

15
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,800
and they're requesting
permission to dock.

16
00:00:31,841 --> 00:00:33,573
Route them to Docking Bay 12.

17
00:00:33,612 --> 00:00:37,179
Inform the Romulan Delegation
we'll meet them there.

18
00:00:40,964 --> 00:00:43,961
And Chief, "light duty"
means light.

19
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:45,565
I don't want to see you
crawling around

20
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,482
the Jefferies tube tonight
looking for power surges.

21
00:00:48,518 --> 00:00:52,255
You won't get any arguments
today, Commander.

22
00:00:52,294 --> 00:00:53,889
Ready, Major?

23
00:01:06,164 --> 00:01:07,531
Promenade.

24
00:01:15,588 --> 00:01:17,422
<i>Du'cha KovaH!</i>

25
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,694
<i>EstaH! EstaH!</i>

26
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:21,200
Constable, I wasn't aware

27
00:01:21,236 --> 00:01:23,606
there were any Klingons
on the station.

28
00:01:23,642 --> 00:01:26,444
They just arrived
a few hours ago.

29
00:01:26,483 --> 00:01:29,582
It seems the main computer
on their freighter was damaged

30
00:01:29,624 --> 00:01:31,720
and they need
a complete overhaul

31
00:01:31,763 --> 00:01:34,999
before they can continue
back to the Klingon Empire.

32
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:36,507
How long is this overhaul
going to take?

33
00:01:39,215 --> 00:01:40,879
Two days, at least.

34
00:01:43,126 --> 00:01:45,290
The Romulan delegation
has just arrived

35
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:47,929
and they're going to be here
at least two days

36
00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:50,307
while they study
our intelligence reports

37
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:51,711
on the Dominion.

38
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:53,845
I want you to keep a close eye
on the Klingons.

39
00:01:53,887 --> 00:01:55,517
We don't need
any trouble right now.

40
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:56,528
Understood.

41
00:01:56,561 --> 00:01:57,825
Let's go.

42
00:01:57,864 --> 00:01:59,767
Come on.

43
00:02:22,862 --> 00:02:24,195
Welcome to Deep Space 9.

44
00:02:24,232 --> 00:02:28,733
I'm Commander Sisko, and this is
my First Officer, Major Kira.

45
00:02:30,415 --> 00:02:32,249
I am Ruwon.
This is Karina.

46
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:35,419
We are ready for your report
on the Dominion.

47
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:36,760
We have arranged
quarters for you.

48
00:02:36,798 --> 00:02:38,997
I know it's been a long trip,
so perhaps you'd like to...

49
00:02:39,038 --> 00:02:40,029
We are not interested

50
00:02:40,074 --> 00:02:41,543
in your accommodations,
Commander.

51
00:02:41,577 --> 00:02:43,445
We are here for
your intelligence briefing...

52
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:44,950
nothing else.

53
00:02:48,529 --> 00:02:49,589
Very well.

54
00:02:49,632 --> 00:02:51,900
If you'll come this way.

55
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:01,854
This will be the foul line.

56
00:03:01,897 --> 00:03:03,697
We need to put a marker
here on the floor.

57
00:03:03,736 --> 00:03:04,864
I still don't see

58
00:03:04,904 --> 00:03:07,068
how this is going to help
my business, Chief.

59
00:03:07,111 --> 00:03:09,413
No, that's not right.

60
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,150
The number 20 needs
to be at the top.

61
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,024
Trust me, Quark.

62
00:03:14,062 --> 00:03:16,968
Darts and bars go together
like bacon and eggs.

63
00:03:17,003 --> 00:03:19,167
At least people order
bacon and eggs.

64
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,042
In all the years
I've been here,

65
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,213
no one has ever come
and asked to see the dart board.

66
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:25,485
Trust me, they will.

67
00:03:25,558 --> 00:03:28,190
I just don't see
the appeal of this game.

68
00:03:29,268 --> 00:03:32,036
No lasers, no holograms.

69
00:03:32,075 --> 00:03:35,481
Just steel tips and feathers.

70
00:03:35,517 --> 00:03:37,351
It's a game of skill, Quark.

71
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:38,653
And it's not easy.

72
00:03:38,692 --> 00:03:39,922
Go ahead.

73
00:03:41,065 --> 00:03:43,059
Try and get one
in the bull's-eye.

74
00:03:45,243 --> 00:03:46,303
No!

75
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:53,363
Now what if one of those darts
had gotten into his eye?

76
00:03:53,397 --> 00:03:55,561
Do you realize
I'd be liable for that?

77
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:58,039
Do you know how much
money an eye costs?

78
00:03:58,076 --> 00:04:00,275
You're not supposed
to throw them like that.

79
00:04:00,315 --> 00:04:03,221
You throw them gently.

80
00:04:03,257 --> 00:04:04,726
One at a time.

81
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,990
Like this.

82
00:04:10,408 --> 00:04:11,377
Chief O'Brien.

83
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:12,539
What is it, Quark?

84
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,549
The Klingons

85
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,247
just destroyed
two of my holosuites.

86
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,054
I need a maintenance crew
immediately.

87
00:04:17,092 --> 00:04:18,254
Quark, this happens

88
00:04:18,296 --> 00:04:20,324
every time the Klingons
come aboard the station.

89
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:22,531
Why don't you just keep
them out of the holosuites?

90
00:04:22,572 --> 00:04:24,806
Did you ever say no
to a Klingon?

91
00:04:24,845 --> 00:04:27,009
Besides, they pay me double.

92
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:37,942
Chief?

93
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,142
Chief!

94
00:06:35,797 --> 00:06:39,101
Well, the pain you experienced
appears to be a muscle spasm

95
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,376
caused by a sudden decrease
in your serum calcium levels.

96
00:06:42,414 --> 00:06:45,820
It's a common side effect
of radiation poisoning.

97
00:06:45,856 --> 00:06:48,328
I'm giving you some
asinolyathin for the pain.

98
00:06:48,363 --> 00:06:50,995
What about the vision I had?

99
00:06:51,037 --> 00:06:52,597
Well, mild hallucinations

100
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:55,011
are also a fairly
common side effect

101
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,516
of radiation poisoning.

102
00:06:56,551 --> 00:06:58,681
It was anything but mild.

103
00:06:58,723 --> 00:07:02,756
I really felt
I was standing on the Promenade

104
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,272
watching myself
talking to Quark.

105
00:07:05,307 --> 00:07:06,867
What was the conversation about?

106
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:09,475
He was complaining
about some Klingons.

107
00:07:09,518 --> 00:07:13,460
He said they'd damaged
two of his holosuites.

108
00:07:13,494 --> 00:07:16,366
Well, you do have one problem.

109
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,897
If all you can hallucinate about
is Quark's maintenance problems

110
00:07:18,942 --> 00:07:20,572
you have a sadly
deficient fantasy life.

111
00:07:21,717 --> 00:07:24,850
Well, thank you
for your professional opinion.

112
00:07:24,892 --> 00:07:26,122
Oh, any time.

113
00:07:26,161 --> 00:07:28,291
My doors are always open to you,
Chief.

114
00:07:29,804 --> 00:07:32,333
The Dominion represents
the greatest threat

115
00:07:32,378 --> 00:07:34,542
to the Alpha Quadrant
in the last century.

116
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,557
We need more information
on its military capabilities.

117
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,150
How many ships do they have?

118
00:07:39,195 --> 00:07:40,528
Where are they deployed?

119
00:07:40,565 --> 00:07:42,729
What are their plans
for the future?

120
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:44,263
Are they planning an attack?

121
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:45,869
We don't know any of that yet.

122
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:47,142
You have one of Founders

123
00:07:47,182 --> 00:07:49,176
of the Dominion
on this very station.

124
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:51,750
He should be able to tell us
everything we need to know

125
00:07:51,795 --> 00:07:52,855
about their intentions.

126
00:07:52,897 --> 00:07:54,959
Odo is not one of the Founders.

127
00:07:55,003 --> 00:07:56,199
Your own reports indicate

128
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:58,142
that a group of changelings
are the real

129
00:07:58,178 --> 00:07:59,910
source of power
behind the Dominion.

130
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:00,940
Yes.

131
00:08:00,985 --> 00:08:02,352
And Odo is a changeling.

132
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:04,223
But he's not
one of the Founders.

133
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,325
I fail to see the distinction.

134
00:08:07,369 --> 00:08:10,069
Odo made a conscious choice
to stay here with us.

135
00:08:10,109 --> 00:08:12,046
He has no loyalties
to the Dominion

136
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,746
and he has no information
about their plans.

137
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:16,781
We find that hard to believe.

138
00:08:16,826 --> 00:08:20,232
It's the truth, whether you
choose to believe it or not.

139
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:33,934
Commander, we allowed you

140
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,772
to place one of our cloaking
devices on the <i>Defiant</i>

141
00:08:36,812 --> 00:08:39,614
in exchange for information
regarding the Dominion.

142
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:45,156
Now you have the cloaking device
and we have very little.

143
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,436
We shouldn't have to remind you
of the importance

144
00:08:48,475 --> 00:08:50,139
both our governments place

145
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:52,207
on continuing to carry out
this agreement.

146
00:08:52,251 --> 00:08:53,618
It's the first treaty

147
00:08:53,654 --> 00:08:56,628
between Romulus and
the Federation in many years.

148
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:57,995
I'm aware of that

149
00:08:58,032 --> 00:09:01,200
and I'm willing to cooperate
with you in any way I can.

150
00:09:01,242 --> 00:09:02,268
Very well, then.

151
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,010
We want to see
every piece of information

152
00:09:05,051 --> 00:09:09,016
Starfleet has on the Dominion,
no matter how insignificant.

153
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:10,587
That includes
any classified reports

154
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,331
you may have made
to Starfleet Command.

155
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,204
I'll have to clear that
with Starfleet.

156
00:09:14,241 --> 00:09:15,733
Then do it.

157
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,048
Chief O'Brien.

158
00:09:31,085 --> 00:09:32,349
What is it, Quark?

159
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:35,419
The Klingons just destroyed
two of my holosuites.

160
00:09:35,463 --> 00:09:37,331
I need a maintenance crew
immediately.

161
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,963
Quark, we go through this

162
00:09:39,006 --> 00:09:41,740
every time Klingons
come aboard the station.

163
00:09:41,813 --> 00:09:43,716
Why don't you ju?

164
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:51,600
I think my holosuites
can wait.

165
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:54,545
It looks like you have
bigger problems.

166
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,964
I went over
the internal sensor logs

167
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:04,197
and I did find evidence

168
00:10:04,238 --> 00:10:06,266
of a minor temporal
disturbance in Quark's

169
00:10:06,311 --> 00:10:09,410
and another one later,
on the Promenade.

170
00:10:09,452 --> 00:10:11,616
Both disturbances happened
at about the same time

171
00:10:11,657 --> 00:10:12,751
as the Chief's experiences.

172
00:10:12,794 --> 00:10:14,024
So, it would seem

173
00:10:14,064 --> 00:10:16,194
that you did travel
into the future

174
00:10:16,235 --> 00:10:18,639
and then returned
to the same moment

175
00:10:18,675 --> 00:10:20,110
that you left.

176
00:10:20,146 --> 00:10:24,556
Have you any idea what might
have caused this time shift?

177
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:25,685
Not yet.

178
00:10:25,728 --> 00:10:27,562
I want to go over
the medical scans

179
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:29,034
Julian took of you earlier.

180
00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:31,439
That dose of ionizing
radiation you received

181
00:10:31,476 --> 00:10:33,971
might have something
to do with it.

182
00:10:34,015 --> 00:10:35,211
How?

183
00:10:35,252 --> 00:10:37,690
I'm not sure,
but it's a good place to start.

184
00:10:37,725 --> 00:10:39,355
I have heard
a couple of theories

185
00:10:39,396 --> 00:10:42,198
that ambient low-level radiation
could have a temporal...

186
00:11:09,474 --> 00:11:10,465
Look out!

187
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:14,283
...effect
on radioactive isotopes.

188
00:11:17,127 --> 00:11:18,791
Chief!

189
00:11:20,034 --> 00:11:21,594
Mr. O'Brien.

190
00:11:28,992 --> 00:11:31,191
I ran a microcellular scan

191
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,358
and detected minute damage

192
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,767
to his cerebrospinal
nerve cells

193
00:11:33,803 --> 00:11:35,967
which might have been caused
by the timeshifting.

194
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,138
Can you repair it?

195
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:38,580
Yes, but the effect
is cumulative.

196
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:40,644
If you keep timeshifting,
there may come a point

197
00:11:40,688 --> 00:11:42,248
where the damage
becomes irreparable.

198
00:11:42,293 --> 00:11:44,059
Eventually, it might
even kill you.

199
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:46,965
Don't worry, Chief...
Dax is using

200
00:11:47,004 --> 00:11:48,337
every scanner on the station

201
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,278
to hunt for any temporal
abnormalities.

202
00:11:50,314 --> 00:11:53,152
Well, if anyone
can find the cause

203
00:11:53,187 --> 00:11:55,682
of the time shifts, it's Dax.

204
00:11:55,727 --> 00:11:57,857
Chief, do you have any idea
of how far into the future

205
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,869
you traveled?

206
00:11:58,902 --> 00:11:59,962
No, sir.

207
00:12:00,005 --> 00:12:02,979
There was nothing to indicate
that it was today

208
00:12:03,046 --> 00:12:04,345
tomorrow, next week.

209
00:12:04,383 --> 00:12:06,719
Well, this conference
with the Romulans

210
00:12:06,756 --> 00:12:09,524
is not supposed to last
longer than three days.

211
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:13,198
In the meantime, I'll have Odo
tighten security around Quark's.

212
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:14,869
How are you feeling, Chief?

213
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,879
Better.

214
00:12:15,913 --> 00:12:16,904
Good.

215
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:19,615
Commander, may I speak with you
for a minute?

216
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:20,785
Of course.

217
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:27,235
The Romulans want
to debrief everyone

218
00:12:27,276 --> 00:12:28,245
who was on the <i>Defiant</i>

219
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:29,713
when it was captured
by the Founders.

220
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,048
They're also still not happy

221
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:33,591
with the sensor information
collected by the <i>Defiant</i>

222
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:36,360
so they want unrestricted
access to the <i>Defiant</i>

223
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,595
and they also want

224
00:12:37,636 --> 00:12:39,504
complete access
to all our personal logs.

225
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,478
Personal logs are
out of the question

226
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:44,178
but they can have limited
access to the <i>Defiant.</i>

227
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,884
I'll let them
debrief us, as well.

228
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,724
I know they're pushing us, Major

229
00:12:48,765 --> 00:12:50,234
but consider their position.

230
00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:51,567
There have never been
any Romulan ships

231
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:52,577
in the Gamma Quadrant

232
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:54,339
so they've never
encountered the Dominion.

233
00:12:54,381 --> 00:12:56,717
So they're completely dependent
on us for information.

234
00:12:56,754 --> 00:12:58,884
Well, then maybe they should
send their own ships

235
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:01,089
through the wormhole
and find out for themselves.

236
00:13:01,132 --> 00:13:03,000
The Romulans generally
prefer to sit back

237
00:13:03,037 --> 00:13:05,441
and pull the strings from
a distance, if they can.

238
00:13:05,476 --> 00:13:07,447
This is one puppet who doesn't
like her strings pulled.

239
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:08,848
I know, but like Ruwon said

240
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:11,515
they've lived up
to their part of the bargain.

241
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:14,360
We have to do everything we can
to live up to ours.

242
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,097
All right, I'll draw up
a schedule of interviews

243
00:13:16,137 --> 00:13:17,436
and I'll tell everyone
to cooperate.

244
00:13:17,474 --> 00:13:19,776
And, Major, when you're
with the Romulans

245
00:13:19,814 --> 00:13:21,785
try to be diplomatic.

246
00:13:21,819 --> 00:13:23,653
I'm always diplomatic.

247
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:27,595
That is the most ridiculous
thing I ever heard

248
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:29,068
and I resent the implication.

249
00:13:29,104 --> 00:13:30,368
You seem very agitated

250
00:13:30,408 --> 00:13:33,074
for someone who's
proclaiming her innocence.

251
00:13:33,115 --> 00:13:36,180
Indeed, your emotional state
would seem to indicate

252
00:13:36,223 --> 00:13:37,783
that our theory is correct

253
00:13:37,826 --> 00:13:40,526
and you did abandon
the <i>Defiant</i> prematurely

254
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:42,697
when it was attacked
by the Jem'Hadar.

255
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:48,651
When the <i>Defiant</i> was attacked

256
00:13:48,688 --> 00:13:50,922
Odo and I were
trapped below decks.

257
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,957
There was a hand-to-hand
fight in the corridor.

258
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:56,597
I was wounded,
and I lost consciousness.

259
00:13:56,642 --> 00:13:58,978
When I came to,
Odo had already put me

260
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:01,451
aboard the shuttle,
and we'd escaped.

261
00:14:01,488 --> 00:14:04,290
I did not abandon
the ship prematurely.

262
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:08,730
Why didn't Odo try to help
the rest of the <i>Defiant's</i> crew?

263
00:14:08,774 --> 00:14:10,175
Well, I'm sure he wanted to

264
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:12,706
but there was no way
to get to the Bridge, and...

265
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,918
Why were you in Odo's quarters
when the ship was attacked?

266
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,623
We were talking.

267
00:14:17,663 --> 00:14:18,825
About what?

268
00:14:18,867 --> 00:14:20,200
It's personal.

269
00:14:20,237 --> 00:14:21,763
Do you often have

270
00:14:21,808 --> 00:14:23,836
personal talks
with the changeling?

271
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,286
What business is that of yours?

272
00:14:27,321 --> 00:14:29,725
We're trying to determine the
nature of your relationship.

273
00:14:29,761 --> 00:14:31,230
You are the only member

274
00:14:31,266 --> 00:14:33,534
of the <i>Defiant's</i> crew
who was not taken prisoner.

275
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:34,540
Why?

276
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:37,240
Did the Founders believe
Odo would react badly

277
00:14:37,281 --> 00:14:38,716
if you were harmed?

278
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:41,920
Did they think you held
some kind of attraction to him?

279
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,230
Has Odo ever shown any kind
of physical interest

280
00:14:45,268 --> 00:14:46,635
in you, Major?

281
00:14:48,878 --> 00:14:50,142
That's it.

282
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,415
You can rip the cloaking device

283
00:14:52,454 --> 00:14:54,152
out of the <i>Defiant</i> right now!

284
00:14:54,191 --> 00:14:57,029
I am not answering
any more questions.

285
00:14:57,066 --> 00:14:59,938
And I suggest you avoid
asking Odo those questions

286
00:14:59,974 --> 00:15:01,638
or you may just find yourself

287
00:15:01,677 --> 00:15:04,549
on the other side
of that bulkhead, floating home.

288
00:15:18,087 --> 00:15:20,058
There.
That's the game.

289
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:21,321
Had enough?

290
00:15:21,362 --> 00:15:22,957
One more.

291
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:26,064
Chief, that's the tenth game
we've played in a row.

292
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,303
Nothing's happening here

293
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:29,543
and I don't think anything
is going to happen.

294
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,953
By telling us about the fight,
you have changed the future.

295
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,550
Security's here, and Quark says

296
00:15:33,593 --> 00:15:35,257
he won't let the Klingons
back in the bar.

297
00:15:35,298 --> 00:15:36,631
There is not going
to be a fight.

298
00:15:36,668 --> 00:15:40,771
I know, I know, but...

299
00:15:40,813 --> 00:15:44,448
I've seen it, and I
can't shake the feeling

300
00:15:44,489 --> 00:15:46,015
that it's going to happen

301
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:47,893
despite our precautions.

302
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:49,663
Something about
the way things look

303
00:15:49,702 --> 00:15:50,762
the number of people.

304
00:15:50,805 --> 00:15:52,673
There's something
a little too familiar

305
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,145
about everything.

306
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,652
All right, if it makes
you feel any better

307
00:15:56,687 --> 00:15:58,783
I'll beat you
at another ten games.

308
00:15:58,826 --> 00:16:00,318
But I can't help
getting the feeling...

309
00:16:02,368 --> 00:16:04,567
<i>Ach'cho korvak bataH!</i>

310
00:16:04,608 --> 00:16:06,009
<i>Karagh, abeH.</i>

311
00:16:13,397 --> 00:16:14,593
You said you weren't
going to let

312
00:16:14,634 --> 00:16:15,728
the Klingons back in the bar!

313
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,296
I didn't.

314
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,900
They were in the holosuites.

315
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:22,386
Besides, now they're
paying me triple.

316
00:16:36,891 --> 00:16:39,455
Who let these filthy <i>pahtk</i>
in here?

317
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,936
Maybe we should
show them the way out.

318
00:16:44,745 --> 00:16:46,477
And then...

319
00:16:46,516 --> 00:16:47,951
What's his name?

320
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:49,320
Ruwon?

321
00:16:49,357 --> 00:16:52,559
Ruwon started to insinuate
that...

322
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:53,625
you were...

323
00:16:53,668 --> 00:16:55,434
That I was what?

324
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,741
Interested in me.

325
00:16:57,779 --> 00:16:58,770
He said that?

326
00:16:58,814 --> 00:17:00,910
Have you ever heard
anything more...

327
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:01,923
Ridiculous!

328
00:17:01,957 --> 00:17:02,926
Exactly.

329
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:03,928
Quark to Security.

330
00:17:03,962 --> 00:17:05,488
I've got a fight on my hands.

331
00:17:05,532 --> 00:17:07,230
They're tearing my place apart.

332
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:30,422
Watch the Romulan!

333
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:34,034
All right, that's enough!

334
00:17:34,073 --> 00:17:35,042
Get back!

335
00:17:35,075 --> 00:17:36,544
Come on!

336
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,083
Move it.
Move it.

337
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,988
Let's go.
Come on now.

338
00:17:47,976 --> 00:17:49,275
Miles?

339
00:18:15,747 --> 00:18:17,445
Chief.

340
00:18:17,486 --> 00:18:18,546
It's all right.

341
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:20,617
You collapsed outside Quark's
about an hour ago.

342
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,324
You're going to be fine.

343
00:18:22,398 --> 00:18:23,867
No, I'm not.

344
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:27,366
In a few hours,
I'm going to be dead.

345
00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:37,268
This is the panel
I saw myself open.

346
00:18:37,304 --> 00:18:40,176
It looked like a phaser
or high-energy laser

347
00:18:40,211 --> 00:18:42,079
came out of the bulkhead.

348
00:18:42,117 --> 00:18:43,484
Nothing on the tricorder.

349
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,551
Just the standard conduits
and power juncture ports.

350
00:18:46,595 --> 00:18:49,067
If there is something
dangerous in there

351
00:18:49,101 --> 00:18:50,127
it could be cloaked

352
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,734
or have some dampening field
around it.

353
00:18:52,778 --> 00:18:54,510
If you gentlemen will
step down the corridor

354
00:18:54,548 --> 00:18:56,884
I'll open the panel
and take a look.

355
00:18:56,921 --> 00:18:58,824
Don't worry.
I'll be careful.

356
00:19:23,758 --> 00:19:25,661
It's all right.

357
00:19:25,696 --> 00:19:27,394
Nothing.

358
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:29,736
You're sure
this is the right panel?

359
00:19:29,774 --> 00:19:30,834
Absolutely.

360
00:19:30,876 --> 00:19:33,212
Believe me,
I've a pretty vivid memory

361
00:19:33,249 --> 00:19:34,479
of the whole thing.

362
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:40,931
Well... since it appears
that your first two time jumps

363
00:19:40,969 --> 00:19:43,464
each moved you to about
five hours into the future

364
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:44,637
we could also assume

365
00:19:44,678 --> 00:19:47,310
that the incident
you saw in this corridor

366
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,258
moved you to about five hours
into the future.

367
00:19:50,293 --> 00:19:52,492
That means someone
will place a device

368
00:19:52,532 --> 00:19:54,119
in this panel
in the next few hours.

369
00:19:54,252 --> 00:19:57,716
All these quarters
are vacant at the moment.

370
00:19:57,761 --> 00:20:00,894
There are no vital power
conduits in this area.

371
00:20:00,936 --> 00:20:02,736
No crucial defense systems.

372
00:20:02,774 --> 00:20:04,768
Why would someone
want to booby-trap

373
00:20:04,813 --> 00:20:05,839
a wall panel here?

374
00:20:05,882 --> 00:20:08,947
I suggest we place
a surveillance device

375
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,323
in this corridor.

376
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,354
If anyone attempts
to tamper with the panel

377
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:13,732
we'll be able to detect it.

378
00:20:14,872 --> 00:20:16,809
Dax to Sisko.

379
00:20:16,844 --> 00:20:18,336
Sisko here.
Go ahead, Lieutenant.

380
00:20:18,381 --> 00:20:20,215
Benjamin,
can you come to Ops?

381
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:23,990
I think I've found a clue
to Chief O'Brien's timeshifting.

382
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:25,498
We're on our way.

383
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:27,059
Keep me informed.

384
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,887
I've been scanning the area
around the station

385
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:35,653
out to a radius
of two kilometers.

386
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,391
I didn't find anything at first.

387
00:20:37,431 --> 00:20:41,305
Then I started to scan some of
the lower subspace bandwidths.

388
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:44,247
I found traces of low-level
tetryon emissions.

389
00:20:44,282 --> 00:20:46,082
I've never seen
an emission pattern

390
00:20:46,154 --> 00:20:48,091
like that
outside of a neutron star.

391
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,720
Or a quantum singularity.

392
00:20:49,762 --> 00:20:51,824
And singularities are
known to send out waves

393
00:20:51,868 --> 00:20:53,064
of temporal displacement.

394
00:20:53,105 --> 00:20:55,076
But if there is
a singularity nearby

395
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,340
why can't we find it?

396
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,947
It should also be affecting the
gravimetric field signatures.

397
00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:00,980
I don't know.

398
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:02,460
Maybe it's buried so far down

399
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:04,900
in the subspace layers
that we can't detect it.

400
00:21:04,936 --> 00:21:06,462
Assuming for the moment

401
00:21:06,506 --> 00:21:08,910
that a singularity
is responsible

402
00:21:08,946 --> 00:21:11,248
how do we combat
its effects on the Chief?

403
00:21:11,285 --> 00:21:14,726
Temporal displacement
caused by a quantum singularity

404
00:21:14,761 --> 00:21:18,703
most commonly affects
delta-series radioisotopes

405
00:21:18,738 --> 00:21:20,230
which is exactly
what the Chief absorbed

406
00:21:20,275 --> 00:21:21,301
during the conduit breach.

407
00:21:21,345 --> 00:21:22,541
So you're saying that it

408
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,951
could be pulling O'Brien's body
like a magnet?

409
00:21:24,988 --> 00:21:26,287
Exactly.

410
00:21:26,324 --> 00:21:29,423
I think I may know a way
to neutralize the remaining

411
00:21:29,466 --> 00:21:30,696
radioisotopes in your body.

412
00:21:30,736 --> 00:21:32,434
Without the radiation

413
00:21:32,474 --> 00:21:34,411
the temporal displacement
might stop.

414
00:21:34,446 --> 00:21:35,506
It's going to take time.

415
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:38,113
You may experience
one or two more time shifts

416
00:21:38,155 --> 00:21:40,149
before I can
complete the process.

417
00:21:40,194 --> 00:21:41,163
When can we start?

418
00:21:41,197 --> 00:21:42,223
Right away.

419
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:50,175
Keep trying to pinpoint
the singularity.

420
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,123
If it is out there,
we need to locate it

421
00:21:52,158 --> 00:21:53,718
and find a way to get rid of it.

422
00:21:53,762 --> 00:21:55,357
Right.

423
00:21:58,039 --> 00:21:59,008
I wanted to let you know

424
00:21:59,042 --> 00:22:00,672
I moved the Romulans
to different quarters.

425
00:22:00,714 --> 00:22:01,683
Oh?

426
00:22:01,716 --> 00:22:02,844
It's the replicators again.

427
00:22:02,886 --> 00:22:04,150
I assigned a maintenance crew.

428
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:06,319
But in the meantime, I moved
the entire Romulan delegation

429
00:22:06,362 --> 00:22:10,499
to section 47, level 2
in the Habitat Ring.

430
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:11,667
Section 47?

431
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:12,870
Yes.
Is something wrong?

432
00:22:12,912 --> 00:22:16,445
The wall panel where O'Brien
saw himself being killed

433
00:22:16,488 --> 00:22:18,687
is right outside those quarters.

434
00:22:19,896 --> 00:22:21,924
Which means either the Romulans

435
00:22:21,969 --> 00:22:25,341
are going to put a device
in the bulkhead themselves

436
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:26,710
or someone else will

437
00:22:26,747 --> 00:22:29,151
possibly to be used
against the Romulans.

438
00:22:29,187 --> 00:22:31,625
Should I move them
to other quarters?

439
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,962
No. That'll warn
whoever is responsible.

440
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,768
But inform Odo
of the change in quarters.

441
00:22:36,807 --> 00:22:40,749
He already has that corridor
under surveillance.

442
00:22:40,784 --> 00:22:42,755
Let's see
how this thing plays out

443
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:44,760
before we make
any further moves.

444
00:22:50,977 --> 00:22:52,503
You have something, Constable?

445
00:22:52,548 --> 00:22:55,954
Someone has planted
a class-3 surveillance device

446
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:58,964
behind the wall panel
we've been monitoring.

447
00:22:58,998 --> 00:23:01,402
Were you able to see who it was?

448
00:23:01,438 --> 00:23:04,138
No, we've been monitoring
the corridor constantly

449
00:23:04,178 --> 00:23:05,613
for the past three hours.

450
00:23:05,648 --> 00:23:07,744
No one's come anywhere
near the panel.

451
00:23:07,788 --> 00:23:10,352
However, sensors did detect

452
00:23:10,394 --> 00:23:14,929
a low-energy transporter beam
a short time ago.

453
00:23:14,972 --> 00:23:19,609
They beamed the device
directly into the wall.

454
00:23:19,652 --> 00:23:23,219
That's a delicate piece
of transporter work.

455
00:23:23,261 --> 00:23:25,061
Yes, it is.

456
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,633
We haven't been able
to trace the beam

457
00:23:28,675 --> 00:23:30,042
to its point of origin

458
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:32,073
but since there aren't
any ships nearby

459
00:23:32,118 --> 00:23:34,590
I believe it originated
on the station.

460
00:23:34,624 --> 00:23:35,650
Any suspects?

461
00:23:36,696 --> 00:23:39,498
Well, since it appears
to be a device

462
00:23:39,537 --> 00:23:41,736
intended to conduct
covert surveillance

463
00:23:41,776 --> 00:23:42,767
of the Romulans

464
00:23:42,812 --> 00:23:45,216
my leading suspects
would be the Klingons.

465
00:23:45,252 --> 00:23:46,346
Do you have any evidence

466
00:23:46,455 --> 00:23:48,654
besides the fact that Klingons
hate Romulans?

467
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:51,029
Well, not yet, but don't worry.

468
00:23:51,066 --> 00:23:54,040
I plan to investigate
the Klingons

469
00:23:54,074 --> 00:23:57,641
the Bajorans, Quark,
the visiting Terrellians...

470
00:23:57,684 --> 00:24:00,213
You think Quark
had something to do with this?

471
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,796
I always investigate Quark.

472
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,086
Looks like you're going
to cheat death, after all.

473
00:24:14,126 --> 00:24:16,792
Round about this time,
you saw yourself being killed.

474
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:21,106
I feel like someone
just walked over my grave.

475
00:24:21,144 --> 00:24:24,084
I mean, I've had a few brushes
with death in my career

476
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:25,554
but there was something

477
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,823
about watching
myself being killed...

478
00:24:27,862 --> 00:24:31,565
of feeling my own neck
for a pulse that wasn't there.

479
00:24:31,605 --> 00:24:35,570
Well, could have been worse.

480
00:24:35,615 --> 00:24:37,415
Could have been me.

481
00:24:39,191 --> 00:24:41,185
Here you are, gentlemen.

482
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:45,640
And how is DS9's
most famous fortune teller?

483
00:24:45,675 --> 00:24:47,441
Don't call me that.

484
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:49,609
I haven't told anyone's fortune.

485
00:24:49,652 --> 00:24:51,886
Oh, just a figure of speech.

486
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:54,088
On the other hand

487
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:57,036
if you should find yourself
in the future again

488
00:24:57,071 --> 00:25:00,170
and you find yourself
passing by the dabo table

489
00:25:00,213 --> 00:25:03,278
would it really hurt
to take a look

490
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,382
at the numbers
coming up on the wheel?

491
00:25:05,426 --> 00:25:09,129
I could make it
worth your while.

492
00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:11,733
Let's get out of here.

493
00:25:15,218 --> 00:25:16,778
Just a thought.

494
00:25:18,927 --> 00:25:20,625
Can you believe that?

495
00:25:20,665 --> 00:25:22,864
I'm being pulled into the future
and all he can think about is...

496
00:25:57,093 --> 00:25:58,562
Chief!

497
00:25:58,631 --> 00:26:01,001
Oh, am I glad to see you.

498
00:26:01,037 --> 00:26:02,701
What the hell
happened to me, Julian?

499
00:26:02,741 --> 00:26:04,176
It was the, the radiation.

500
00:26:04,212 --> 00:26:07,050
I didn't realize it had
damaged the basilar arteries

501
00:26:07,086 --> 00:26:09,285
in your brain stem
until it was too late.

502
00:26:09,325 --> 00:26:10,316
Well, why not?

503
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:12,299
It didn't show up
on any of the diagnostics.

504
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:13,632
I couldn't tell
what had happened

505
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:14,934
until I was doing the autopsy.

506
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:16,533
Autopsy.

507
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:18,480
Yeah, I just finished
doing it a few moments ago.

508
00:26:18,516 --> 00:26:20,042
Do you want me
to show you the results?

509
00:26:20,086 --> 00:26:21,077
No, no, no!

510
00:26:21,123 --> 00:26:23,117
That's, that's all right.

511
00:26:23,161 --> 00:26:25,725
Now, look, when you go
back to the past

512
00:26:25,768 --> 00:26:29,004
ask me to perform
a basilar arterial scan

513
00:26:29,043 --> 00:26:30,946
and since you're going
five hours back into the past

514
00:26:30,982 --> 00:26:32,212
I should have enough time

515
00:26:32,252 --> 00:26:34,382
to find the damage
and repair it before...

516
00:26:34,424 --> 00:26:36,224
this happens.

517
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:37,926
Right.

518
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:44,210
How could you just let me die?

519
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,084
I didn't just let you die.

520
00:26:46,121 --> 00:26:47,454
I did everything I could

521
00:26:47,491 --> 00:26:49,394
to keep you alive
for over an hour

522
00:26:49,429 --> 00:26:50,921
but your body just gave up.

523
00:26:50,966 --> 00:26:52,401
Gave up?

524
00:26:52,437 --> 00:26:54,909
I'm sorry, Chief.

525
00:26:54,944 --> 00:26:56,277
But there comes a point

526
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:58,285
when the human body
just gives up.

527
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:00,051
Yeah, well, maybe
my Doctor wasn't...

528
00:27:01,962 --> 00:27:03,431
Bashir to Infirmary.

529
00:27:03,465 --> 00:27:06,462
I need a nurse and an emergency
medkit here immediately.

530
00:27:08,312 --> 00:27:11,411
We finally were able
to localize the transporter beam

531
00:27:11,453 --> 00:27:13,515
and trace it back
to this location.

532
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,929
These quarters have
been vacant for weeks.

533
00:27:15,964 --> 00:27:17,490
Somehow they overrode

534
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:20,874
the security lock
on the door to gain access.

535
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:22,039
So, what did they do?

536
00:27:22,081 --> 00:27:23,641
Bring in a portable transporter

537
00:27:23,752 --> 00:27:25,586
and beam
the surveillance equipment

538
00:27:25,623 --> 00:27:26,614
into the bulkhead?

539
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:28,596
That was my first thought

540
00:27:28,631 --> 00:27:32,266
but then I realized
that a portable transporter

541
00:27:32,307 --> 00:27:33,740
is a rather large
and bulky piece of equipment

542
00:27:33,874 --> 00:27:35,811
to be carrying around the halls.

543
00:27:35,846 --> 00:27:36,837
That's true.

544
00:27:36,882 --> 00:27:41,759
So, then I began thinking
about...

545
00:27:43,934 --> 00:27:45,267
the replicator.

546
00:27:47,877 --> 00:27:51,181
Ah... they realigned
the matter-energy

547
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,780
conversion matrix.

548
00:27:52,823 --> 00:27:55,591
Turning it
into a small transporter...

549
00:27:55,631 --> 00:28:00,474
a very sophisticated,
very professional job.

550
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,778
So now we know
how they did it.

551
00:28:02,816 --> 00:28:04,446
The next question is who.

552
00:28:04,487 --> 00:28:07,586
I think I have the answer
to that as well.

553
00:28:10,637 --> 00:28:14,579
Now, this device is manufactured
on Davlos Ill...

554
00:28:14,613 --> 00:28:16,881
a planet on the Klingon border.

555
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,415
In fact, Davlos does
over 90 percent

556
00:28:19,459 --> 00:28:21,293
of its trade
with the Klingon Empire.

557
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:24,898
Oh, that's still very little
evidence to make an arrest.

558
00:28:24,941 --> 00:28:26,376
Yes, it is

559
00:28:26,411 --> 00:28:30,251
but then I contacted a friend
at Starfleet Intelligence

560
00:28:30,287 --> 00:28:33,693
who used to be assigned
to the Federation Embassy

561
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,496
on the Klingon Homeworld.

562
00:28:35,534 --> 00:28:38,565
He put me in contact
with a former Klingon operative

563
00:28:38,608 --> 00:28:42,072
who is out of favor
with the current administration.

564
00:28:42,118 --> 00:28:44,750
This former operative
sent me a series of reports...

565
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:45,760
Odo...

566
00:28:45,794 --> 00:28:47,286
cut to the chase.

567
00:28:47,331 --> 00:28:50,635
The three Klingons
now on the station

568
00:28:50,674 --> 00:28:54,115
are part
of a covert strike force

569
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:57,521
that reports directly
to the Klingon High Council.

570
00:28:57,558 --> 00:28:59,084
Why didn't you just say so?

571
00:28:59,129 --> 00:29:01,761
Well, sometimes I have
to remind you

572
00:29:01,802 --> 00:29:03,568
just how good I am.

573
00:29:03,607 --> 00:29:06,409
Mm. So, Gowron sent
our three friends here

574
00:29:06,448 --> 00:29:08,647
and they're conducting
surveillance

575
00:29:08,686 --> 00:29:09,712
on the Romulan delegation.

576
00:29:09,756 --> 00:29:10,782
Why?

577
00:29:10,826 --> 00:29:12,524
Are they here to kill them?

578
00:29:12,564 --> 00:29:13,624
Possibly.

579
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:15,603
It's also possible
that this is just

580
00:29:15,639 --> 00:29:18,077
a routine intelligence-
gathering operation.

581
00:29:18,111 --> 00:29:21,085
The high-energy laser
that killed O'Brien

582
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:22,783
is simply a booby trap

583
00:29:22,824 --> 00:29:25,730
to prevent someone from
tampering with the device.

584
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:27,668
It's not meant
for assassination.

585
00:29:27,703 --> 00:29:30,871
Well, in either case,
I think we have enough evidence

586
00:29:30,911 --> 00:29:33,645
to at least hold the Klingons
for questioning, don't you?

587
00:29:33,685 --> 00:29:34,779
Absolutely.

588
00:29:34,821 --> 00:29:36,883
And I think I can question them

589
00:29:36,927 --> 00:29:40,163
until the Romulan delegation
leaves the station.

590
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:42,001
Just be careful.

591
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:46,651
Commander,
there is no careful way

592
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:49,021
to question a Klingon.

593
00:29:53,068 --> 00:29:55,540
I have...
I haven't given up.

594
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,705
I won't give up.

595
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,185
It's all right, Chief.

596
00:30:00,221 --> 00:30:01,554
You're okay.

597
00:30:04,499 --> 00:30:05,934
No, I'm not.

598
00:30:08,442 --> 00:30:12,248
You need to run
a basilar arterial scan.

599
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:13,754
Why?

600
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:15,088
Because if you don't

601
00:30:15,126 --> 00:30:18,123
I'm going to die
in less than five hours.

602
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:19,636
Who told you that?

603
00:30:19,671 --> 00:30:22,509
You did.

604
00:30:22,545 --> 00:30:24,209
In the future.

605
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:27,256
Oh.

606
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:29,661
Well, who am I
to argue with me?

607
00:30:31,569 --> 00:30:32,560
Let me go!

608
00:30:33,841 --> 00:30:35,276
This is an outrage.

609
00:30:35,312 --> 00:30:36,576
We have done nothing.

610
00:30:39,389 --> 00:30:41,087
We will have our vengeance
on all of you for this.

611
00:30:41,127 --> 00:30:43,291
You are treating us
with dishonor.

612
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:45,031
We have done nothing wrong.

613
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:50,345
We take a very dim view of spies
and saboteurs on this station.

614
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:51,920
Now you slander us.

615
00:30:51,954 --> 00:30:55,122
When my family finds out
what you have done

616
00:30:55,164 --> 00:30:57,602
they will come here
and kill you.

617
00:30:57,636 --> 00:30:59,162
I doubt that very much.

618
00:30:59,207 --> 00:31:01,839
The only people
who will be coming here

619
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,614
are your friends
in Klingon Intelligence.

620
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:06,455
And from what I understand

621
00:31:06,493 --> 00:31:09,661
they don't like being
embarrassed by operatives

622
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,698
who fail in their missions.

623
00:31:12,743 --> 00:31:16,742
However, should you suddenly
feel like cooperating

624
00:31:16,786 --> 00:31:19,281
I may be persuaded
to let you go

625
00:31:19,326 --> 00:31:23,234
without contacting your friends
in Intelligence.

626
00:31:28,483 --> 00:31:30,717
May be.

627
00:31:43,121 --> 00:31:45,355
So how are you feeling, Chief?

628
00:31:45,394 --> 00:31:46,863
Better, sir.

629
00:31:46,897 --> 00:31:47,923
I've eliminated

630
00:31:47,967 --> 00:31:49,870
almost all the radioisotopes
from his body.

631
00:31:49,905 --> 00:31:51,306
Have to wait a couple more hours

632
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:52,972
before I give him
the last treatment.

633
00:31:53,013 --> 00:31:55,383
But after that, there should be
no more timeshifting.

634
00:31:57,023 --> 00:31:58,755
What about
the quantum singularity?

635
00:31:58,795 --> 00:32:00,425
We've been able to track it

636
00:32:00,466 --> 00:32:03,030
by using its tetryon emissions
as a guide.

637
00:32:03,073 --> 00:32:05,409
It seems to be orbiting
Deep Space 9

638
00:32:05,513 --> 00:32:07,416
in a roughly elliptical fashion.

639
00:32:07,518 --> 00:32:10,617
At certain points in its orbit,
the singularity radiates

640
00:32:10,659 --> 00:32:13,188
temporal energy
at a specific wavelength.

641
00:32:13,232 --> 00:32:16,034
That seems to be
what triggers my time shifts.

642
00:32:16,073 --> 00:32:18,203
Is there any way
to break it out of its orbit

643
00:32:18,245 --> 00:32:19,407
and send it on its way?

644
00:32:19,448 --> 00:32:20,781
Well, we were hoping
to station...

645
00:32:22,657 --> 00:32:23,626
Come on, come on.

646
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,027
Hurry up.
We don't have much time!

647
00:32:26,133 --> 00:32:27,568
Prepare to seal the hatch

648
00:32:27,603 --> 00:32:29,437
and release the docking clamps.

649
00:32:30,911 --> 00:32:32,175
Move quickly.
Let's go.

650
00:32:32,215 --> 00:32:34,813
All the way back.
Move quickly.

651
00:32:34,855 --> 00:32:35,949
Come on.

652
00:32:35,992 --> 00:32:38,989
Initiating emergency
escape protocol.

653
00:32:39,032 --> 00:32:41,596
Hang on,
I'm going to full impulse.

654
00:32:50,563 --> 00:32:52,089
Now what?

655
00:32:52,133 --> 00:32:53,625
You're here!

656
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,539
Look, I don't know
what happened.

657
00:32:55,576 --> 00:32:58,641
I was asleep in bed when
the whole station was rocked

658
00:32:58,684 --> 00:32:59,880
by an explosion.

659
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:03,326
Before I could get to Ops,
the evacuation alarm sounded.

660
00:33:03,362 --> 00:33:05,333
And the com systems were down.

661
00:33:05,368 --> 00:33:08,068
I got as many people
as I could in here.

662
00:33:08,108 --> 00:33:10,740
I don't know what happened
to the others.

663
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:13,654
When you go back, you have
to find out what happened

664
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,057
and stop it.

665
00:33:27,325 --> 00:33:29,193
My God!

666
00:33:33,273 --> 00:33:36,543
Chief, what's wrong?

667
00:33:36,582 --> 00:33:39,282
We've got a new problem, sir.

668
00:33:43,466 --> 00:33:45,403
Did you see anything
from the runabout

669
00:33:45,439 --> 00:33:48,037
that would indicate
how the station was destroyed?

670
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:50,175
There were a series
of explosions

671
00:33:50,217 --> 00:33:52,621
that rippled across
the Habitat Ring.

672
00:33:52,657 --> 00:33:54,252
But it all happened so fast

673
00:33:54,295 --> 00:33:57,759
I couldn't get a clear sense
of exactly what was going on.

674
00:33:57,804 --> 00:34:00,744
Could you tell if you were
looking at internal explosions

675
00:34:00,778 --> 00:34:03,546
which might indicate some kind
of sabotage or accident

676
00:34:03,586 --> 00:34:05,854
or external explosions,
which might indicate

677
00:34:05,891 --> 00:34:07,087
we were under attack?

678
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,258
No. No, I'm not sure.

679
00:34:09,301 --> 00:34:11,933
Do you remember seeing
any other ships nearby?

680
00:34:11,974 --> 00:34:14,812
No, but I had a very limited
view of the area.

681
00:34:14,849 --> 00:34:16,820
Well, it looks
like, at this point

682
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:18,449
we can't rule anything out.

683
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:19,982
Agreed.

684
00:34:21,332 --> 00:34:23,827
Make preparations
to evacuate the station.

685
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,459
Do it quietly.

686
00:34:25,592 --> 00:34:27,426
If the destruction
of the station

687
00:34:27,464 --> 00:34:29,800
is the result
of an attack or sabotage

688
00:34:29,836 --> 00:34:31,739
we don't want
to alarm our enemy

689
00:34:31,775 --> 00:34:36,151
and make him trigger events
we're trying to avoid.

690
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,624
Begin a complete systems check
of everything on the station

691
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,824
that could potentially
cause this kind of explosion.

692
00:34:40,865 --> 00:34:42,061
Right.

693
00:34:42,101 --> 00:34:44,265
Commander...

694
00:34:44,308 --> 00:34:46,872
there might be another way
to find out what's going on.

695
00:34:46,914 --> 00:34:49,318
If I could travel
into the future again...

696
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:52,658
this time just before
the destruction of DS9...

697
00:34:52,696 --> 00:34:54,930
I might be able to find out
what's going to happen

698
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:56,529
then return to the present

699
00:34:56,572 --> 00:34:59,204
in time for us to prevent it
from happening.

700
00:34:59,313 --> 00:35:02,344
If you could flood my body
with high concentrations

701
00:35:02,387 --> 00:35:05,155
of delta-series radioisotopes,
it might trigger

702
00:35:05,261 --> 00:35:07,665
a time shift into the future.

703
00:35:07,701 --> 00:35:10,401
Possibly,
but those isotopes are toxic.

704
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,913
It could cause permanent damage
to your nervous system.

705
00:35:12,948 --> 00:35:14,349
It might even kill you.

706
00:35:14,386 --> 00:35:18,158
Well, if the future happens
the way I saw it happen

707
00:35:18,195 --> 00:35:20,132
a lot of people are
going to get killed

708
00:35:20,167 --> 00:35:21,431
when the station explodes.

709
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,100
It's a risk I'm willing to take.

710
00:35:23,142 --> 00:35:25,614
Even if you're able
to initiate a time jump

711
00:35:25,648 --> 00:35:28,086
each time you traveled
into the future

712
00:35:28,121 --> 00:35:30,115
you've always gone five hours.

713
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,066
How do you propose to shorten
the length of a jump?

714
00:35:33,101 --> 00:35:35,939
Well, there might be a link
between the temporal frequency

715
00:35:35,974 --> 00:35:37,102
of the singularity

716
00:35:37,144 --> 00:35:39,240
and the length
of the time shift.

717
00:35:39,283 --> 00:35:42,519
We might be able to calibrate

718
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:44,257
the decay constant
of the isotope

719
00:35:44,362 --> 00:35:45,661
that we inject you with

720
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,637
to match the frequency
of the singularity.

721
00:35:47,672 --> 00:35:49,164
And with a few minor adjustments

722
00:35:49,209 --> 00:35:50,644
we can control
how far you jump

723
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,649
into the future.

724
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:52,912
Exactly.

725
00:35:54,623 --> 00:35:55,785
All right.

726
00:35:55,826 --> 00:35:58,298
But if you can't do it
within two hours

727
00:35:58,366 --> 00:36:01,204
I'm going to begin
to evacuate the station.

728
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,607
Understood.

729
00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:12,165
Now, when you activate
this device

730
00:36:12,202 --> 00:36:15,199
it'll inject you with a two-rad
dose of delta isotopes.

731
00:36:15,243 --> 00:36:16,405
Now, if our calculations
are right

732
00:36:16,446 --> 00:36:18,280
that should put you about
three hours into the future.

733
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:19,877
What's the margin of error?

734
00:36:19,922 --> 00:36:21,414
Plus or minus half an hour,
I'd say.

735
00:36:21,459 --> 00:36:22,792
But that's the best we could do.

736
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,698
Now, it's already set
for the return trip.

737
00:36:24,734 --> 00:36:26,671
So all you have to do
is activate it again

738
00:36:26,706 --> 00:36:28,073
to return to the present.

739
00:36:28,109 --> 00:36:29,078
Right.

740
00:36:29,112 --> 00:36:31,914
And remember,
don't wait too long.

741
00:36:31,954 --> 00:36:33,423
Your body will be experiencing

742
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:35,325
symptoms
of severe radiation poisoning.

743
00:36:35,362 --> 00:36:38,336
If you don't get treatment,
it will kill you.

744
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,307
I won't forget.

745
00:36:40,342 --> 00:36:41,436
Good.

746
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,685
Julian, there's a...

747
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,022
a message in my quarters
for Keiko if...

748
00:36:47,059 --> 00:36:49,657
I understand, Miles.

749
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:17,936
0200.

750
00:37:19,877 --> 00:37:22,645
That's three and a half hours
into the future.

751
00:37:31,307 --> 00:37:33,278
Miles, Miles!

752
00:37:33,313 --> 00:37:34,373
Wake up!

753
00:37:34,415 --> 00:37:36,511
What?

754
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:38,046
Computer, lights.

755
00:37:43,238 --> 00:37:45,836
Oh, no, not you again.

756
00:37:47,315 --> 00:37:48,545
What is it now?

757
00:37:48,585 --> 00:37:49,679
Listen to me.

758
00:37:49,722 --> 00:37:51,750
I've jumped ahead
and seen your future.

759
00:37:51,794 --> 00:37:55,064
Don't ask me how,
it'll take too long to explain.

760
00:37:55,102 --> 00:37:58,440
There's going to be a disaster.

761
00:37:58,478 --> 00:38:00,848
DS9 will be destroyed.

762
00:38:02,455 --> 00:38:03,754
Destroyed? How?

763
00:38:03,791 --> 00:38:04,953
I don't know.

764
00:38:04,994 --> 00:38:06,224
That's why I'm here.

765
00:38:06,264 --> 00:38:09,136
I have to find out
what's going to happen

766
00:38:09,172 --> 00:38:13,775
and then travel back
into the past and prevent it.

767
00:38:16,792 --> 00:38:18,193
You look pretty bad.

768
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:21,932
It's the radiation.

769
00:38:21,972 --> 00:38:24,912
Well, if you feel bad
and you're my past self

770
00:38:24,946 --> 00:38:26,712
shouldn't I feel bad, too?

771
00:38:28,789 --> 00:38:31,227
I hate temporal mechanics.

772
00:38:33,034 --> 00:38:35,506
Let's get down to Ops
and see what's going on.

773
00:38:41,022 --> 00:38:42,720
Help me up.

774
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:56,253
Run a sensor sweep
of the entire station.

775
00:38:56,294 --> 00:38:58,892
Look for anything
that might indicate a...

776
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:01,597
Report!

777
00:39:01,642 --> 00:39:03,613
A Romulan warbird just
de-cloaked off of Lower Pylon 2.

778
00:39:03,647 --> 00:39:05,846
They've taken out
our shield generators.

779
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,184
On screen.

780
00:39:09,763 --> 00:39:12,703
Lock phasers and return fire.

781
00:39:14,174 --> 00:39:16,008
They've hit the fusion reactor.

782
00:39:16,046 --> 00:39:17,106
Main power's down.

783
00:39:17,148 --> 00:39:19,552
Defense systems off-line.

784
00:39:19,588 --> 00:39:23,360
Try to reroute phasers through
the emergency power couplings.

785
00:39:26,707 --> 00:39:28,267
Miles, you've got your answer.

786
00:39:28,311 --> 00:39:29,678
The quantum singularity

787
00:39:29,714 --> 00:39:31,708
that's been orbiting
the station...

788
00:39:31,753 --> 00:39:32,847
it's the Romulans.

789
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:34,588
Are you listening?

790
00:39:34,627 --> 00:39:36,187
The Romulans use

791
00:39:36,231 --> 00:39:38,533
a confined singularity
to power their warp core.

792
00:39:38,571 --> 00:39:40,131
That's what we've
been detecting.

793
00:39:40,175 --> 00:39:42,009
That's what's causing
the time shifts.

794
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,310
You must go back and tell them

795
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:46,917
to put up the shields
and stand by for an attack.

796
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:50,092
I can't.

797
00:39:50,134 --> 00:39:53,131
I can't get through
another shift.

798
00:39:53,175 --> 00:39:55,773
It's the radiation poisoning,
it...

799
00:40:00,461 --> 00:40:01,987
You go.

800
00:40:02,031 --> 00:40:03,831
Just activate it.

801
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:06,935
It's set for the return trip.

802
00:40:06,978 --> 00:40:08,504
Me?

803
00:40:08,549 --> 00:40:10,041
I don't belong there.

804
00:40:10,086 --> 00:40:12,650
I'm you... you're me...

805
00:40:12,692 --> 00:40:15,666
It does... doesn't matter.

806
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,930
Just go.

807
00:40:18,909 --> 00:40:19,900
Go!

808
00:40:38,392 --> 00:40:39,759
Chief!

809
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:40,820
What happened?

810
00:40:42,002 --> 00:40:44,497
It worked.

811
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:45,670
O'Brien to Sisko.

812
00:40:45,712 --> 00:40:47,147
Go ahead, Chief.

813
00:40:47,182 --> 00:40:50,054
I've been to the future,
Commander.

814
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:52,392
The quantum singularity
off the station

815
00:40:52,429 --> 00:40:55,426
is actually in the warp core
of a cloaked Romulan warbird.

816
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:58,410
They're going to de-cloak and
fire on us in a matter of hours.

817
00:40:58,444 --> 00:41:00,278
Understood, Chief.

818
00:41:00,316 --> 00:41:01,785
Raise shields.

819
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,723
Stand by weapons systems.

820
00:41:03,759 --> 00:41:06,699
I don't understand it.

821
00:41:06,732 --> 00:41:09,570
Your body should be flooded
with delta-series radiation

822
00:41:09,607 --> 00:41:11,943
but there's only a tiny
amount in your tissues.

823
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,578
Your metabolic readings
are different.

824
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,589
What happened?

825
00:41:15,623 --> 00:41:19,177
There's been a... a change.

826
00:41:21,482 --> 00:41:25,481
Uh... I really have
nothing else to say.

827
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,496
I think you're lying, Quark.

828
00:41:27,531 --> 00:41:29,023
About what part?

829
00:41:29,068 --> 00:41:30,401
All of it.

830
00:41:30,438 --> 00:41:32,068
Well, at least I'm consistent.

831
00:41:34,316 --> 00:41:36,686
Quark, you can leave.

832
00:41:37,691 --> 00:41:39,525
Thank you.

833
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:47,304
I know you have a cloaked
warbird orbiting the station.

834
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:49,650
And I know that you're
planning an attack.

835
00:41:49,689 --> 00:41:51,751
At first, I couldn't
understand why

836
00:41:51,794 --> 00:41:53,024
and then I remembered

837
00:41:53,064 --> 00:41:54,796
what you said
about the Dominion...

838
00:41:54,835 --> 00:41:57,741
how they were the greatest
threat to the Alpha Quadrant

839
00:41:57,776 --> 00:41:59,040
in the last century.

840
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,744
If you really believed that

841
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:02,652
then the only way you
could ever be truly safe

842
00:42:02,689 --> 00:42:05,663
from the Dominion would be
to collapse the wormhole.

843
00:42:05,697 --> 00:42:07,429
But you knew we wouldn't
just sit by

844
00:42:07,468 --> 00:42:08,801
and watch while you did it.

845
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:10,742
So you had to destroy
the station, too.

846
00:42:10,777 --> 00:42:13,808
That way,
there'd be no witnesses.

847
00:42:13,852 --> 00:42:16,826
Everyone would assume
that Deep Space 9 was destroyed

848
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:19,423
by what appeared to be
the accidental collapse

849
00:42:19,466 --> 00:42:20,992
of the wormhole.

850
00:42:21,036 --> 00:42:22,700
An interesting...

851
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:25,077
theory, Commander.

852
00:42:25,114 --> 00:42:27,552
But that's all it is,
a theory.

853
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:29,113
That's right.

854
00:42:29,158 --> 00:42:31,357
But I'll tell you
what's not a theory.

855
00:42:31,464 --> 00:42:34,997
We tracked the tetryon emissions
back to your warbird

856
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,071
and I have about 50 photon
torpedoes locked onto it

857
00:42:38,114 --> 00:42:40,244
right now.

858
00:42:51,281 --> 00:42:53,309
I think it's time we left.

859
00:42:53,354 --> 00:42:54,823
I couldn't agree more.

860
00:42:54,858 --> 00:42:58,060
Constable, will you please
escort our... guests

861
00:42:58,099 --> 00:43:00,229
to the nearest transporter room?

862
00:43:00,272 --> 00:43:02,266
If you'll come with me.

863
00:43:18,586 --> 00:43:21,024
So you're telling me
that you remember

864
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:23,691
playing this game
with me in the future?

865
00:43:23,732 --> 00:43:24,723
Right.

866
00:43:26,005 --> 00:43:29,446
All right, what am I
going to hit?

867
00:43:29,515 --> 00:43:31,885
20, outer ring.

868
00:43:37,535 --> 00:43:39,027
Why, that's remarkable.

869
00:43:39,073 --> 00:43:40,941
It's also a little disturbing.

870
00:43:40,978 --> 00:43:45,285
I have this nagging feeling
that I don't really belong here.

871
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:47,020
This isn't really my life.

872
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,724
You know, maybe this life

873
00:43:48,764 --> 00:43:51,134
belongs
to that other Miles O'Brien.

874
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,038
Listen, Chief, whether you
are living in the past

875
00:43:53,075 --> 00:43:54,510
or the present,
you are Miles O'Brien.

876
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,346
The only difference is
you have a few memories

877
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:57,444
the other one didn't have.

878
00:43:59,826 --> 00:44:02,355
Well, I think I'll go to bed.

879
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,462
I'm still kind of tired.

880
00:44:04,539 --> 00:44:06,841
Now, that sounds
like a good idea.

881
00:44:09,518 --> 00:44:11,455
Quark.

882
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:13,324
Dabo.

883
00:44:13,362 --> 00:44:15,196
Dabo?

884
00:44:15,233 --> 00:44:16,429
Dabo!

885
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:23,218
Wait, Chief, wait!
