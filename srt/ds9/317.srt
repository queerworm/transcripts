1
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:07,341
It's all right, Chief.
You're going to be just fine.

2
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:09,885
What happened?

3
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:11,470
You were rerouting
a phase inducer

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,764
when one of the plasma
conduits blew out.

5
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:15,808
Oh.

6
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:19,186
Easy there, Chief.
You've got a mild case
of radiation poisoning.

7
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:22,230
I'll give you some
hyronalin which should
counteract the effects,

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,149
but I do think
he should be restricted

9
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,734
to light duty
for the next few days.

10
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:26,694
Agreed.

11
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:28,153
Commander,

12
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,738
the transport's arrived

13
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,448
and they're requesting
permission to dock.

14
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,200
Route them to Docking Bay 12.

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,869
Inform the Romulan Delegation

16
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:36,829
we'll meet
them there.

17
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:38,622
(<i> groans</i> )

18
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:43,335
And, Chief, "light duty"
means light.

19
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,713
I don't want
to see you crawling around
the Jefferies tube tonight

20
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,923
looking for power surges.

21
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:50,300
You won't get any arguments
today, Commander.

22
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:53,929
Ready, Major?

23
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,984
Promenade.

24
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:19,287
KLINGON:<i> Du'cha KovaH!</i>
<i>EstaH! EstaH!</i>

25
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,873
Constable,
I wasn't aware

26
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:22,624
there were any Klingons
on the station.

27
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,002
They just arrived
a few hours ago.

28
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:28,505
It seems the main computer
on their freighter was damaged

29
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,925
and they need
a complete overhaul

30
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:34,219
before they can continue
back to the Klingon Empire.

31
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,095
How long is this overhaul
going to take?

32
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:38,766
(<i> belches</i> )

33
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,392
Two days, at least.

34
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,064
The Romulan delegation
has just arrived

35
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:47,524
and they're going to be here
at least two days

36
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,235
while they study
our intelligence reports
on the Dominion.

37
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,529
I want you to keep a close eye
on the Klingons.

38
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,615
We don't need
any trouble right now.

39
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,033
Understood.

40
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,451
Let's go.

41
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,911
Come on.

42
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,104
Welcome to Deep Space 9.
I'm Commander Sisko,

43
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:28,189
and this is
my first Officer,
Major Kira.

44
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,569
I am Ruwon.
This is Karina.

45
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,863
We are ready for your report
on the Dominion.

46
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,657
We have arranged
quarters for you.

47
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,700
I know it's been
a long trip, so
perhaps you'd like...

48
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,995
We are not interested
in your accommodations,
Commander.

49
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:44,372
We are here for
your intelligence briefing--
nothing else.

50
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,919
Very well.

51
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,712
If you'll
come this way.

52
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,180
This will be
the foul line.

53
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,266
We need to put a marker
here on the floor.

54
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:06,394
I still don't see how
this is going to help
my business, Chief.

55
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:10,189
No, that's not right.
The number 20 needs
to be at the top.

56
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:16,321
Trust me, Quark.
Darts and bars go together
like bacon and eggs.

57
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,074
At least people<i> order</i>
bacon and eggs.

58
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,827
In all the years
I've been here,
no one has ever come

59
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,620
and asked to see
the dart board.

60
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,164
Trust me, they will.

61
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:28,625
I just don't see the
appeal of this game.

62
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,419
No lasers, no holograms.

63
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,756
Just steel tips
and feathers.

64
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,968
It's a game of skill, Quark.
And it's not easy.

65
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,928
Go ahead.

66
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,430
Try and get one
in the bull's-eye.

67
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,641
(<i> sighs</i> )

68
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,642
No!

69
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,858
Now what if one of those darts
had gotten into his eye?

70
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,860
Do you realize
I'd be liable for that?

71
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,945
Do you know how much
money an eye costs?

72
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,614
You're not supposed to
throw them like that.

73
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,242
You throw them gently.

74
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,036
One at a time.

75
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:05,204
Like this.

76
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,044
QUARK: Chief O'Brien.
O'BRIEN: What is it, Quark?

77
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,213
The Klingons
just destroyed two
of my holosuites.

78
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,381
I need a maintenance
crew immediately.

79
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,300
Quark, this happens
every time the Klingons
come aboard the station.

80
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,469
O'BRIEN:
Why don't you just keep
them out of the holosuites?

81
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:26,183
Did you ever say no
to a Klingon?
Besides, they pay me double.

82
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,236
Chief?

83
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:38,319
Chief!

84
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,690
Well, the pain
you experienced

85
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,399
appears to be
a muscle spasm

86
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,069
caused by a
sudden decrease

87
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,778
in your serum
calcium levels.

88
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,197
It's a common
side effect

89
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:46,907
of radiation
poisoning.

90
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,576
I'm giving you some
asinolyathin for the pain.

91
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:52,204
What about
the vision I had?

92
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:54,039
Well, mild
hallucinations

93
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,749
are also a fairly
common side effect

94
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,500
of radiation
poisoning.

95
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,920
It was anything but mild.

96
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,715
I really felt I was
standing on the Promenade

97
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,967
watching myself
talking to Quark.

98
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,053
What was the
conversation about?

99
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,180
He was complaining
about some Klingons.

100
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,850
He said they'd damaged
two of his holosuites.

101
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,895
Well, you do have
<i>one</i> problem.

102
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,356
If all you can hallucinate
about is Quark's
maintenance problems,

103
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,316
you have a sadly
deficient fantasy life.

104
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,984
(<i> chuckles</i> )

105
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,153
Well, thank you for
your professional opinion.

106
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,198
Oh, any time.
My doors are always
open to<i> you,</i> Chief.

107
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,411
RUWON:
The Dominion represents
the greatest threat

108
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:35,205
to the Alpha Quadrant
in the last century.

109
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:38,333
We need more information
on its military
capabilities.

110
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,751
How many ships
do they have?

111
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,128
Where are they
deployed?

112
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,171
What are their plans
for the future?

113
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,672
Are they planning
an attack?

114
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,758
We don't know
any of that yet.

115
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,761
You have one of Founders
of the Dominion
on this very station.

116
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:53,473
He should be able to tell us
everything we need to know
about their intentions.

117
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,642
Odo is not one
of the Founders.

118
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,145
Your own reports indicate
that a group of changelings

119
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,563
are the real source of power
behind the Dominion.

120
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,899
KIRA: Yes.
And Odo is a changeling.

121
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,818
But he's not one
of the Founders.

122
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,778
I fail to see
the distinction.

123
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:10,490
Odo made a conscious choice
to stay here with us.

124
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,826
He has no loyalties
to the Dominion

125
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,329
and he has no information
about their plans.

126
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,247
We find that
hard to believe.

127
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:20,750
It's the truth, whether you
choose to believe it or not.

128
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,183
Commander, we allowed you
to place one of our cloaking
devices on the<i> Defiant</i>

129
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,935
in exchange for information
regarding the Dominion.

130
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,731
Now you have
the cloaking device,

131
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,608
and we have very little.

132
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,820
KARINA:
We shouldn't have to remind you
of the importance

133
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,573
both our governments place
on continuing to carry out
this agreement.

134
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:57,037
It's the first treaty between
Romulus and the Federation
in many years.

135
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:01,749
I'm aware of that,
and I'm willing to cooperate
with you in any way I can.

136
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,377
Very well, then.

137
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,504
We want to see
every piece of information

138
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:08,507
Starfleet has on the Dominion,
no matter how insignificant.

139
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,717
That includes
any classified reports

140
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,760
you may have made
to Starfleet Command.

141
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,679
I'll have to clear that
with Starfleet.

142
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,181
Then do it.

143
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,238
QUARK:
Chief O'Brien.

144
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,114
What is it, Quark?

145
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,867
The Klingons just destroyed
two of my holosuites.

146
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,744
I need a maintenance
crew immediately.

147
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,371
Quark, we go through this

148
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:42,082
every time Klingons
come aboard the station.

149
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,583
Why don't you ju...?

150
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,259
I think my holosuites
can wait.

151
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,844
It looks like you have
bigger problems.

152
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:04,479
I went over
the internal sensor logs
and I did find evidence

153
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,606
of a minor temporal
disturbance in Quark's

154
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,983
and another one later,
on the Promenade.

155
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,403
Both disturbances happened
at about the same time

156
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,154
as the Chief's experiences.

157
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,031
So, it would seem

158
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,033
that you<i> did</i> travel
into the future

159
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,579
and then returned
to the same moment
that you left.

160
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:24,958
Have you any idea what might
have caused this time shift?

161
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,960
Not yet.

162
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,088
I want to go over
the medical scans
Julian took of you earlier.

163
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,549
That dose of ionizing
radiation you received

164
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,426
might have something
to do with it.

165
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,303
How?
I'm not sure,

166
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,012
but it's a good
place to start.

167
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,680
I have heard
a couple of theories

168
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,266
that ambient
low-level radiation

169
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,683
could have
a temporal...

170
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,769
(<i> people shouting</i> )

171
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:49,941
(<i> glass shattering</i> )

172
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,711
Look out!

173
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,508
DAX: ...effect on
radioactive isotopes.

174
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:15,674
(<i> O'Brien thuds to ground</i> )

175
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,053
Chief!

176
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,806
Mr. O'Brien.

177
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,192
I ran a microcellular scan

178
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,819
and detected minute damage
to his cerebrospinal nerve cells

179
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,613
which might have been caused
by the time-shifting.

180
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,657
Can you repair it?
Yes.

181
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:40,950
But the effect is cumulative.
If you keep time-shifting,

182
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,994
there may come a point
where the damage
becomes irreparable.

183
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,621
Eventually, it might
even kill you.

184
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,914
(<i> sighs</i> )
SISKO:
Don't worry, Chief--

185
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,916
Dax is using
every scanner on the station

186
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,960
to hunt for
any temporal abnormalities.

187
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,712
Well, if anyone
can find the cause

188
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,923
of the time shifts, it's Dax.

189
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:59,927
Chief, do you have any idea
of how far into the future
you traveled?

190
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:03,264
No, sir. There was
nothing to indicate
that it was today,

191
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,141
tomorrow, next week.

192
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,310
Well, this conference
with the Romulans

193
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,021
is not supposed to last
longer than three days.

194
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,730
In the meantime,
I'll have Odo

195
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,108
tighten security
around Quark's.

196
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,276
How are you feeling,
Chief?

197
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,903
Better.
Good.

198
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,531
Commander, may I speak
with you for a minute?

199
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:20,739
Of course.

200
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,540
The Romulans want
to debrief everyone
who was on the<i> Defiant</i>

201
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,668
when it was captured
by the Founders.
They're also still not happy

202
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,087
with the sensor information
collected by the<i> Defiant,</i>

203
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,006
so they want unrestricted
access to the<i> Defiant</i>

204
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,343
<i>and</i> they also want
complete access to
all our personal logs.

205
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,387
Personal logs are
out of the question,

206
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,681
but they can have limited
access to the<i> Defiant.</i>

207
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,183
I'll let them
debrief us as well.
(<i> exasperated sigh</i> )

208
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,893
I know they're
pushing us, Major,

209
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,020
but consider
their position.

210
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,732
There have never been
any Romulan ships in
the Gamma Quadrant

211
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,816
so they've never
encountered the Dominion.

212
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,027
So they're completely
dependent on us
for information.

213
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,071
Well, then maybe they should
send their own ships

214
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,822
through the wormhole
and find out for themselves.

215
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,117
The Romulans generally
prefer to sit back

216
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,244
and pull the strings from
a distance, if they can.

217
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,204
This is one puppet who doesn't
like her strings pulled.

218
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,164
I know, but
like Ruwon said,

219
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,250
they've lived up to their
part of the bargain.

220
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,669
We have to do
everything we can
to live up to ours.

221
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,546
All right, I'll draw up
a schedule of interviews

222
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,590
and I'll tell everyone
to cooperate.

223
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,092
And, Major, when you're
with the Romulans

224
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,052
try to be diplomatic.

225
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,055
I'm always
diplomatic.

226
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,891
That is the most ridiculous
thing I ever heard,

227
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,060
and I resent the implication.

228
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,021
You seem very agitated
for someone who's
proclaiming her innocence.

229
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,566
Indeed, your emotional state
would seem to indicate

230
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,359
that our theory is correct

231
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,445
and you did abandon
the<i> Defiant</i> prematurely

232
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,905
when it was attacked
by the Jem'Hadar.

233
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,157
(<i> sighs</i> )

234
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,496
When the<i> Defiant</i>
was attacked,

235
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:52,373
Odo and I were
trapped below decks.

236
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,459
There was a hand-to-hand
fight in the corridor.

237
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,128
I was wounded,
and I lost consciousness.

238
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,172
When I came to,
Odo had already put me

239
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,007
aboard the shuttle,
and we'd escaped.

240
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:05,011
I did not abandon
the ship prematurely.

241
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,846
Why didn't Odo try to help

242
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,432
the rest of
the<i> Defiant's</i> crew?

243
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,267
Well, I'm sure he wanted to,

244
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,186
but there was no way
to get to the Bridge, and...

245
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,937
Why were you in
Odo's quarters

246
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,690
when the ship was attacked?

247
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,065
We were talking.

248
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,609
About what?

249
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:20,819
It's personal.

250
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:22,403
Do you
often have

251
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,572
personal talks
with the changeling?

252
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,867
What business is that of yours?

253
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,203
We're trying to determine the
nature of your relationship.

254
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,831
You are the only
member of the
<i>Defiant's</i> crew

255
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:35,041
who was not taken
prisoner. Why?

256
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,960
Did the Founders
believe Odo would
react badly

257
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,838
if you were harmed?

258
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:42,549
Did they think you held
some kind of attraction to him?

259
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:47,261
Has Odo ever shown
any kind of physical
interest in you, Major?

260
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:53,059
That's it.
You can rip the cloaking device

261
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,728
out of the<i> Defiant</i>
right now!

262
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:57,271
I am not answering
any more questions.

263
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,525
And I suggest you avoid
asking Odo those questions

264
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:05,154
or you may just find yourself
on the other side of
that bulkhead, floating home.

265
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,670
There.
That's the game.

266
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,256
Had enough?
One more.

267
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:27,134
Chief, that's the tenth game
we've played in a row.

268
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,888
Nothing's happening here
and I don't think anything
is<i> going</i> to happen.

269
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,473
By telling us about
the fight, you have
changed the future.

270
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,434
Security's here,
and Quark says

271
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,852
he won't let the Klingons
back in the bar.

272
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,020
There is not going
to be a fight.

273
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,023
I know, I know, but...

274
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:44,736
I've seen it, and I
can't shake the feeling

275
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,405
that it's going to happen
despite our precautions.

276
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,742
Something about
the way things look,
the number of people.

277
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:53,912
There's something
a little too familiar
about everything.

278
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,831
All right, if it makes
you feel any better,

279
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:59,333
I'll beat you
at another ten games.

280
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,835
But I can't help
getting the feeling...

281
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,837

You said you weren't
going to let the Klingons

286
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,811
I didn't.

287
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,604
They were in
the holosuites.

288
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,649
Besides, now they're
paying me triple.

Who let these filthy

Maybe we should
show them the way out.

292
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,798
And then...

293
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:49,091
What's his name?
Ruwon?

294
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,595
Ruwon started
to insinuate that...

295
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,138
you were...

296
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,849
That I was what?

297
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:59,811
Interested in me.
He said that?

298
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,354
Have you ever heard
anything more...

299
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,772
Ridiculous!
Exactly.

300
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,064
Quark to Security.

301
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,483
I've got a fight on my hands.

302
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,234
They're tearing my place apart.

Move it.
Move it.

00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,435
Let's go.
Come on now.

309
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,653

310
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,530
(<i> gasps</i> )
(<i> groaning</i> )

311
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,848
Chief. It's all right.

312
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,017
You collapsed outside Quark's
about an hour ago.

313
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,685
You're going to be fine.

314
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,063
No, I'm not.

315
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,648
In a few hours,
I'm going to be dead.

316
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,951
This is the panel
I saw myself open.

317
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,703
It looked like a phaser
or high-energy laser

318
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,956
came out
of the bulkhead.

319
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,999
Nothing
on the tricorder.

320
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,961
Just the standard conduits
and power juncture ports.

321
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,046
If there is something
dangerous in there,

322
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:53,049
it could be cloaked
or have some dampening field
around it.

323
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,843
If you gentlemen will
step down the corridor

324
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,845
I'll open the panel
and take a look.

325
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,430
Don't worry.
I'll be careful.

326
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,915
It's all right.

327
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,750
Nothing.

328
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,128
You're sure this
is the right panel?

329
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,171
Absolutely.

330
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,008
Believe me,
I've a pretty vivid memory
of the whole thing.

331
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,846
(<i> sighs</i> )
Well... since
it appears

332
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,973
that your first
two time jumps

333
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:44,475
each moved you
to about five hours
into the future,

334
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:48,228
we could also assume
that the incident you
saw in this corridor

335
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,898
moved you to about five
hours into the future.

336
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,067
ODO:
That means someone
will place a device

337
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:55,235
in this panel
in the next few hours.

338
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:58,865
All these quarters
are vacant
at the moment.

339
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,993
There are no vital power
conduits in this area.

340
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:03,953
No crucial
defense systems.

341
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,873
Why would someone
want to booby-trap
a wall panel here?

342
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:11,377
I suggest we place
a surveillance device
in this corridor.

343
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:15,965
If anyone attempts
to tamper with the panel,
we'll be able to detect it.

344
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,842
Dax to Sisko.

345
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,343
Sisko here.
Go ahead, Lieutenant.

346
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,345
Benjamin,
can you come to Ops?

347
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:25,099
I think I've found a clue to
Chief O'Brien's time-shifting.

348
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,684
We're on our way.

349
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,061
Keep me informed.

350
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,942
DAX:
I've been scanning the area
around the station

351
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,694
out to a radius
of two kilometers.

352
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,738
I didn't find anything at first.

353
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:42,408
Then I started to scan some of
the lower subspace bandwidths.

354
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,494
I found traces of low-level
tetryon emissions.

355
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,705
I've never seen
an emission pattern
like that

356
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,040
outside
of a neutron star.

357
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,750
Or a quantum singularity.

358
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,543
And singularities are
known to send out waves

359
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,253
of temporal displacement.

360
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,922
But if there<i> is</i>
a singularity nearby,

361
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,381
why can't we find it?

362
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,966
It should also
be affecting

363
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,968
the gravimetric
field signatures.

364
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,303
I don't know.
Maybe it's buried so far down

365
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:06,015
in the subspace layers
that we can't detect it.

366
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,767
Assuming
for the moment

367
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,936
that a singularity
<i>is</i> responsible,

368
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,271
how do we combat
its effects on the Chief?

369
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:16,400
Temporal displacement
caused by a quantum singularity

370
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,570
most commonly affects
delta-series radioisotopes,

371
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,073
which is exactly
what the Chief absorbed
during the conduit breach.

372
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:25,952
So you're saying
that it could be pulling
O'Brien's body like a magnet?

373
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:29,663
Exactly. I think I may
know a way to neutralize

374
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,749
the remaining radioisotopes
in your body.

375
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,375
DAX: Without the radiation,

376
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,377
the temporal displacement
might stop.

377
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,546
It's going to take time.
You may experience

378
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,090
one or two
more time shifts

379
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,716
before I can
complete the process.

380
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,176
When can we start?

381
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,219
Right away.

382
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,685
Keep trying to pinpoint
the singularity.

383
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,813
If it is out there,
we need to locate it

384
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,315
and find a way
to get rid of it.
Right.

385
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:02,029
I wanted to let you know
I moved the Romulans
to different quarters.

386
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,073
Oh?
It's the
replicators again.

387
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,783
I assigned
a maintenance crew.
But in the meantime,

388
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:07,994
I moved the entire
Romulan delegation

389
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:11,038
to section 47, level 2
in the Habitat Ring.

390
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,581
Section 47?

391
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,708
Yes. Is something wrong?
The wall panel

392
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,836
where O'Brien saw
himself being killed

393
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,379
is right outside
those quarters.

394
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,923
(<i> sighs</i> )

395
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,092
Which means either the Romulans

396
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,761
are going to put a device
in the bulkhead themselves

397
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,596
or someone else will

398
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,141
possibly to be used
against the Romulans.

399
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:31,725
Should I move them
to other quarters?

400
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,937
No. That'll warn
whoever is responsible.

401
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:38,065
But inform Odo
of the change in quarters.

402
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:41,152
He already has that corridor
under surveillance.

403
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,279
Let's see how
this thing plays out

404
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,656
before we make
any further moves.

405
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,789
You have something,
Constable?

406
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,792
Someone has
planted a class-3
surveillance device

407
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,670
behind the wall panel
we've been monitoring.

408
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,547
Were you able
to see who it was?

409
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,717
No, we've been monitoring
the corridor constantly

410
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,260
for the past three hours.

411
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,846
No one's come anywhere
near the panel.

412
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:11,932
However, sensors
did detect

413
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,268
a low-energy
transporter beam

414
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:16,270
a short time ago.

415
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:21,150
They beamed the device
directly into the wall.

416
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,278
That's a delicate piece
of transporter work.

417
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,364
Yes, it is.

418
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:29,325
We haven't been able
to trace the beam

419
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,868
to its point of origin,

420
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,995
but since there aren't
any ships nearby,

421
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,497
I believe it originated
on the station.

422
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,456
Any suspects?

423
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,044
Since it appears
to be a device

424
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:42,296
intended to conduct
covert surveillance

425
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:43,881
of the Romulans,

426
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:46,050
my leading suspects
would be the Klingons.

427
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,885
Do you have any evidence
besides the fact

428
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,427
that Klingons hate Romulans?

429
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,889
Well, not yet,
but don't worry.

430
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:54,767
I plan to investigate
the Klingons

431
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:58,729
the Bajorans, Quark,
the visiting Terrellians...

432
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,981
You think Quark had
something to do with this?

433
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:04,568
I always investigate Quark.

434
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,787
Looks like you're going
to cheat death, after all.

435
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,206
Round about this time,
you saw yourself
being killed.

436
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,919
I feel like someone just
walked over my grave.

437
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,131
I mean, I've had a few brushes
with death in my career,

438
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:29,093
but there was something
about watching myself
being killed--

439
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:32,138
of feeling my own neck for
a pulse that wasn't there.

440
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,434
Well, could have
been worse.

441
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,185
Could have been me.

442
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,895
(<i> chuckles</i> )

443
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,355
Here you are, gentlemen.

444
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:46,402
And how is DS9's
most famous fortune teller?

445
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,237
Don't call me that.

446
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:50,488
I haven't told
anyone's fortune.

447
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:53,159
Oh, just a figure
of speech.

448
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,952
On the other hand,

449
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:57,621
if you should find yourself
in the future again,

450
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,749
and you find yourself
passing by the dabo table,

451
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,961
would it really hurt
to take a look

452
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:06,005
at the numbers
coming up on the wheel?

453
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,134
I could make it
worth your while.

454
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,094
Let's get
out of here.

455
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,391
Just a thought.

456
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:22,188
Can you believe that?
I'm being pulled
into the future,

457
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:23,481
and all he can
think about is...

458
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,266
Chief!

459
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,977
Oh, am I glad
to see you.

460
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,729
What the hell
happened to me, Julian?

461
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:06,023
It was the, the radiation.

462
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:08,775
I didn't realize it had
damaged the basilar arteries
in your brain stem

463
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,986
until it was too late.
Well, why not?

464
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,280
It didn't show up on
any of the diagnostics.

465
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,991
I couldn't tell
what had happened until
I was doing the autopsy.

466
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,575
Autopsy.

467
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:19,577
I just finished doing it
a few moments ago.

468
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,080
Do you want me
to show you the results?

469
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,083
No, no, no!
That's, that's all right.

470
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,668
Now, look, when you go
back to the past,

471
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,922
ask me to perform
a basilar arterial scan,

472
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,924
and since you're going
five hours back into the past

473
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,926
I should have enough time
to find the damage

474
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:37,346
and repair it before...
this happens.

475
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:38,764
Right.

476
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:45,229
How could you
just let me die?

477
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:47,481
I didn't just
let you die.

478
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:50,109
I did everything I could
to keep you alive
for over an hour,

479
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,944
but your body
just gave up.

480
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,113
Gave up?

481
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:56,823
I'm sorry, Chief.
But there comes a point

482
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,201
when the human body
just gives up.

483
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,953
Yeah, well, maybe
my Doctor wasn't...

484
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,498
Bashir to Infirmary.

485
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,750
I need a nurse and an emergency
medkit here immediately.

486
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,629
We finally were
able to localize
the transporter beam

487
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:14,674
and trace it back
to this location.

488
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,676
These quarters have
been vacant for weeks.

489
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,387
Somehow they overrode

490
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:21,807
the security lock on
the door to gain access.

491
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:24,726
So, what did they do?
Bring in a portable
transporter

492
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,396
and beam the
surveillance equipment
into the bulkhead?

493
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,773
That was
my first thought,

494
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:33,068
but then I realized that
a portable transporter

495
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,904
is a rather large and
bulky piece of equipment

496
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,531
to be carrying
around the halls.

497
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:40,242
That's true.
So...

498
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:43,370
then I began
thinking about...

499
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,790
the replicator.

500
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:52,796
Ah... they realigned
the matter-energy

501
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,298
conversion matrix.

502
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:57,217
Turning it into
a small transporter--

503
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:02,139
a very sophisticated,
very professional job.

504
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,057
So now we know
<i>how</i> they did it.

505
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,976
The next question is who.

506
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:08,646
I think I have the answer
to that as well.

507
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:16,028
Now, this device is manufactured
on Davlos III--

508
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,364
a planet on
the Klingon border.

509
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:20,866
ODO:
In fact, Davlos does
over 90 percent

510
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,784
of its trade
with the Klingon Empire.

511
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:26,955
Oh, that's still very little
evidence to make an arrest.

512
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:32,336
Yes, it is, but then
I contacted a friend at
Starfleet Intelligence

513
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:35,130
who used to be assigned
to the Federation Embassy

514
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,882
on the Klingon Homeworld.

515
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,925
He put me in contact

516
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,803
with a former
Klingon operative
who is out of favor

517
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,681
with the current
administration.

518
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:46,225
This former operative sent
me a series of reports...

519
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,602
Odo... cut to the chase.

520
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:52,231
The three Klingons
now on the station

521
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:55,568
are part of
a covert strike force

522
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:58,945
that reports directly
to the Klingon High Council.

523
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,531
Why didn't you just say so?

524
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:03,325
Well, sometimes I have
to remind you

525
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:04,951
just how good I am.

526
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:09,289
Mm. So, Gowron sent
our three friends here

527
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,459
and they're conducting
surveillance on the
Romulan delegation. Why?

528
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,045
Are they here to kill them?
Possibly.

529
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:16,714
It's also possible
that this is just

530
00:29:16,714 --> 00:29:19,425
a routine intelligence-
gathering operation.

531
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:22,553
The high-energy laser
that killed O'Brien

532
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:27,099
is simply a booby trap
to prevent someone from
tampering with the device.

533
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,142
It's not meant
for assassination.

534
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,853
Well, in either case,
I think we have
enough evidence

535
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:35,023
to at least
hold the Klingons for
questioning, don't you?

536
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:38,736
Absolutely.
And I think I can
question them

537
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:41,655
until the Romulan delegation
leaves the station.

538
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:44,116
Just be careful.

539
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:47,994
Commander, there
is no careful way

540
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:50,372
to question a Klingon.

541
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:56,878
I have...
I haven't given up.

542
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,297
(<i> panting</i> )

543
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,006
I won't give up.

544
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,550
It's all right, Chief.

545
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,676
You're okay.

546
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,389
No, I'm not.

547
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:13,646
You need to run
a basilar arterial scan.

548
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:14,896
Why?

549
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,315
Because if you don't,

550
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:19,485
I'm going to die
in less than five hours.

551
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:21,027
Who told you that?

552
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,904
You did.

553
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,324
In the future.

554
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,034
Oh.

555
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,954
Well, who am I
to argue with me?

556
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,374
Let me go!

557
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,084
KLINGON:
This is an outrage.

558
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,670
We have
done nothing.

559
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,675
We will have our vengeance
on all of you for this.

560
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:45,218
You are treating us
with dishonor.

561
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,346
We have done
nothing wrong.

562
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:51,183
We take a very dim view of spies
and saboteurs on this station.

563
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,310
Now you slander us.

564
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,855
When my family finds out
what you have done,

565
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,940
they will come here
and kill you.

566
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,818
I doubt that very much.

567
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:02,986
The only people
who will be coming here

568
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:06,615
are your friends
in Klingon Intelligence.

569
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:08,450
And from what I understand,

570
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:11,495
they don't like being
embarrassed by operatives

571
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,372
who fail in their missions.

572
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:17,876
However, should you suddenly
feel like cooperating,

573
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,671
I may be persuaded
to let you go

574
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:24,424
without contacting your friends
in Intelligence.

575
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,890
Maybe.

576
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,946
So how are you feeling, Chief?

577
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,782
Better, sir.

578
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:51,076
I've eliminated almost all
the radioisotopes from his body.

579
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,952
Have to wait
a couple more hours

580
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,788
before I give him
the last treatment.
But after that,

581
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:56,540
there should be no more
time-shifting.

582
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,586
SISKO:
What about the
quantum singularity?

583
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:04,214
We've been able to track it
by using its tetryon
emissions as a guide.

584
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,466
It seems to be orbiting
Deep Space 9

585
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,176
in a roughly
elliptical fashion.

586
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,011
At certain points
in its orbit,

587
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,722
the singularity
radiates

588
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:14,433
temporal energy
at a specific wavelength.

589
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:17,018
That seems to be
what triggers my time shifts.

590
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,730
Is there any way
to break it out of its orbit
and send it on its way?

591
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,981
Well, we were
hoping to station...

592
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,525
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

593
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:24,984
O'BRIEN: Come on,
come on. Hurry up.

594
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,153
We don't have much time!

595
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,697
Prepare to seal
the hatch

596
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,365
and release the
docking clamps.

597
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:34,035
MAN:
Move quickly.
Let's go.

598
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,663
All the way back.
Move quickly. Come on.

599
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:40,041
Initiating emergency
escape protocol.

600
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,669
Hang on,
I'm going to full impulse.

601
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:53,138
Now what?

602
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,014
You're here!

603
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,225
Look, I don't know
what happened.

604
00:32:57,225 --> 00:33:00,646
I was asleep in bed when
the whole station was rocked
by an explosion.

605
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:04,357
Before I could get to Ops,
the evacuation alarm sounded.

606
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,192
And the com systems
were down.

607
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:09,070
O'BRIEN:
I got as many people
as I could in here.

608
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,824
I don't know what happened
to the others.

609
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:14,743
When you go back, you have
to find out what happened

610
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,119
and stop it.

611
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,716
My God!

612
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:36,515
Chief, what's wrong?

613
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,059
We've got a new problem, sir.

614
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,650
Did you see anything
from the runabout

615
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,486
that would indicate
how the station was destroyed?

616
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:51,488
There were a series
of explosions

617
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:54,032
that rippled across
the Habitat Ring.

618
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,993
But it all happened so fast,

619
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:59,120
I couldn't get a clear sense
of exactly what was going on.

620
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,540
Could you tell if you were
looking at internal explosions,

621
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,292
which might indicate some kind
of sabotage or accident,

622
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,253
or external explosions,
which might indicate

623
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,630
we were
under attack?

624
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,799
No. No, I'm not sure.

625
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:13,259
Do you remember seeing
any other ships nearby?

626
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:16,179
No, but I had a very limited
view of the area.

627
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,681
Well, it looks like,
at this point

628
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:19,641
we can't rule
anything out.

629
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:20,976
Agreed.

630
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:25,230
Make preparations
to evacuate the station.

631
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,315
Do it quietly.

632
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,275
If the destruction
of the station

633
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,611
is the result
of an attack or sabotage,

634
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,530
we don't want
to alarm our enemy

635
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:37,576
and make him trigger events
we're trying to avoid.

636
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,327
Begin a complete
systems check

637
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,287
of everything
on the station

638
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:43,122
that could potentially
cause this kind
of explosion.

639
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,499
Right.

640
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,084
O'BRIEN:
Commander...

641
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,377
there might be another way

642
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:49,170
to find out what's going on.

643
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,130
If I could travel
into the future again--

644
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:54,384
this time just before
the destruction of DS9--

645
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,803
I might be able to find out
what's going to happen,

646
00:34:56,803 --> 00:35:00,933
then return to the present
in time for us to prevent it
from happening.

647
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:03,810
If you could flood
my body with high
concentrations

648
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,771
of delta-series
radioisotopes,

649
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:09,066
it might trigger
a time shift
into the future.

650
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:12,360
Possibly,
but those isotopes are toxic.

651
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,114
It could cause permanent damage
to your nervous system.
It might even kill you.

652
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,868
Well, if the future happens
the way I saw it happen,

653
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,327
a lot of people are
going to get killed

654
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,162
when the station
explodes.

655
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,957
It's a risk I'm willing to take.

656
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:27,375
SISKO:
Even if you're able to
initiate a time jump,

657
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,753
each time you traveled
into the future,

658
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:31,964
you've always gone five hours.

659
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:34,758
How do you propose to shorten
the length of a jump?

660
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:37,719
Well, there might be a link
between the temporal frequency

661
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,345
of the singularity

662
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,973
and the length
of the time shift.

663
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:44,142
We might be able
to calibrate

664
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,312
the decay constant
of the isotope that
we inject you with

665
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,481
to match the frequency
of the singularity.

666
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,274
And with a few
minor adjustments,

667
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,192
we can control
how far you jump
into the future.

668
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,569
Exactly.

669
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,614
All right.

670
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,950
But if you can't do it
within two hours,

671
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:02,911
I'm going to begin
to evacuate the station.

672
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:04,245
Understood.

673
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,839
Now, when you activate
this device,

674
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,675
it'll inject you with a two-rad
dose of delta isotopes.

675
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,510
Now, if our calculations
are right,

676
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,928
that should put you about
three hours into the future.

677
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,513
What's the margin
of error?

678
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:22,973
Plus or minus
half an hour, I'd say.

679
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:24,432
But that's the best
we could do.

680
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,351
It's already set
for the return trip.

681
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:29,104
So all you have to do is
activate it again to return
to the present.

682
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:33,316
Right.
And remember,
don't wait too long.

683
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:34,860
Your body will be experiencing

684
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,737
symptoms of severe
radiation poisoning.

685
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,990
If you don't get treatment,
it will kill you.

686
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,950
I won't forget.

687
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,035
Good.

688
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:46,371
Julian, there's a...

689
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,665
a message in my quarters
for Keiko if...

690
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:51,250
I understand, Miles.

691
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:19,404
0200.

692
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:23,366
That's three and a half hours
into the future.

693
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:34,794
Miles, Miles!

694
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,379
Wake up!
What?

695
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,716
Computer, lights.

696
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,348
Oh, no, not you again.

697
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,103
What is it now?
Listen to me.

698
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:53,188
I've jumped ahead
and seen your future.

699
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:56,482
Don't ask me how,
it'll take too long to explain.

700
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:00,237
There's going to be a disaster.

701
00:38:00,237 --> 00:38:02,321
DS9 will be destroyed.

702
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,075
Destroyed? How?

703
00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:07,619
I don't know.
That's why I'm here.

704
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,622
I have to find out
what's going to happen

705
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:15,210
and then travel back
into the past and prevent it.

706
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,631
You look pretty bad.

707
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,384
It's the radiation.

708
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:26,054
Well, if you feel bad
and you're my past self,

709
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:28,098
shouldn't
I feel bad, too?

710
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:32,644
BOTH:
I hate temporal mechanics.

711
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,940
Let's get down to Ops
and see what's going on.

712
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,069
(<i> groaning</i> )

713
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:43,446
Help me up.

714
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:57,752
Run a sensor sweep
of the entire station.

715
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,463
Look for anything
that might indicate a...

716
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,423
Report!

717
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,926
A Romulan warbird just
de-cloaked off of Lower Pylon 2.

718
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:07,012
They've taken out
our shield generators.

719
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:08,180
On screen.

720
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:12,934
Lock phasers and return fire.

721
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,520
(<i> groans</i> )

722
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,189
They've hit the fusion reactor.

723
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:18,982
Main power's down.

724
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:21,067
Defense systems
off-line.

725
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:24,196
Try to reroute phasers
through the emergency
power couplings.

726
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,575
Miles, you've got
your answer.

727
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:32,578
The quantum singularity that's
been orbiting the station--

728
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,122
it's the Romulans.

729
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:37,000
Are you listening?
The Romulans use

730
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,836
a confined singularity
to power their warp core.

731
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,671
That's what we've
been detecting.

732
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,548
That's what's causing
the time shifts.

733
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,424
You must go back
and tell them

734
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:48,261
to put up the shields
and stand by
for an attack.

735
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:51,181
I can't.

736
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:53,558
I can't get through
another shift.

737
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:56,936
It's the radiation poisoning,
it...

738
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,360
You go.

739
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,237
Just activate it.

740
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:08,406
It's set for
the return trip.

741
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,824
Me?

742
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,326
I don't belong there.

743
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:14,579
I'm you... you're me...

744
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,873
It does... doesn't matter.

745
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:18,208
Just go.

746
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,211
Go!

747
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:22,254
(<i> explosion</i> )

748
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,981
Chief! What happened?

749
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:44,442
It worked.

750
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:46,903
O'Brien to Sisko.

751
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,613
SISKO:
Go ahead, Chief.

752
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:51,449
I've been to the
future, Commander.

753
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,368
The quantum singularity
off the station

754
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:54,869
is actually
in the warp core

755
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,746
of a cloaked
Romulan warbird.

756
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:58,415
They're going to de-cloak
and fire on us

757
00:40:58,415 --> 00:40:59,916
in a matter of hours.

758
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:01,293
Understood, Chief.

759
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:03,128
Raise shields.

760
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:04,837
Stand by weapons systems.

761
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,257
I don't
understand it.

762
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:08,967
Your body
should be flooded

763
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,802
with delta-series
radiation,

764
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,929
but there's only a tiny
amount in your tissues.

765
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,973
Your metabolic readings
are different.

766
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,766
What happened?

767
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:19,477
There's been a...
a change.

768
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:27,193
Uh... I really have
nothing else to say.

769
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,279
I think you're lying, Quark.

770
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:30,780
About what part?

771
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,115
All of it.

772
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,908
Well, at least
I'm consistent.

773
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,868
(<i> laughs</i> )

774
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,121
Quark, you can leave.

775
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,207
Thank you.

776
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:49,090
I know you have a cloaked
warbird orbiting the station.

777
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,217
And I know that you're
planning an attack.

778
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,594
At first, I couldn't
understand why,

779
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:56,764
and then I remembered
what you said about
the Dominion--

780
00:41:56,764 --> 00:42:00,268
how they were the greatest
threat to the Alpha Quadrant
in the last century.

781
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,437
If you really
believed that,

782
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,314
then the only way you
could ever be truly safe

783
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:06,732
from the Dominion would be
to collapse the wormhole.

784
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,693
But you knew we wouldn't
just sit by

785
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,320
and watch while you did it.

786
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,280
So you had to destroy
the station, too.

787
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,615
That way, there'd
be no witnesses.

788
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:17,952
Everyone would assume that
Deep Space 9 was destroyed

789
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:22,290
by what appeared to be
the<i> accidental</i> collapse
of the wormhole.

790
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,417
An interesting...

791
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:26,585
theory, Commander.

792
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:29,381
But that's all it is,
a theory.

793
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:33,009
That's right.
But I'll tell you
what's not a theory.

794
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:36,346
We tracked the tetryon emissions
back to your warbird

795
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:40,975
and I have about
50 photon torpedoes
locked onto it right now.

796
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:54,197
I think it's time we left.

797
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:56,115
I couldn't agree more.

798
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:59,660
Constable, will you please
escort our... guests

799
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,372
to the nearest
transporter room?

800
00:43:02,372 --> 00:43:03,789
If you'll
come with me.

801
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:23,560
So you're telling me
that you remember
playing this game

802
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,977
with me in the future?

803
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,854
Right.

804
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:31,109
All right, what am I
going to hit?

805
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:32,860
20, outer ring.

806
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:40,535
Why, that's remarkable.

807
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:42,495
It's also a little disturbing.

808
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:44,622
I have this nagging feeling

809
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,332
that I don't really belong here.

810
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,709
This isn't really my life.

811
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,211
You know, maybe this life

812
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,505
belongs
to that other Miles O'Brien.

813
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:55,258
Listen, Chief, whether you
are living in the past
or the present,

814
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:57,176
you<i> are</i> Miles O'Brien.
The only difference is,

815
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,928
you have a few memories
the other one didn't have.

816
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:04,142
Well, I think I'll go to bed.

817
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,935
I'm still kind of tired.

818
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:08,271
Now,<i> that</i> sounds
like a good idea.

819
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:13,025
Quark.

820
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,860
Dabo.

821
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,695
Dabo?

822
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:17,947
PLAYERS:
Dabo!

823
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:20,283
(<i> excited cheering</i> )

824
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:24,870
Wait, Chief, wait!

825
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,247
(<i> laughs</i> )
