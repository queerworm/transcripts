00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:04,546
<i>Last time on</i>
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...

2
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,133
The<i> Rotarran</i> and the<i> Koraga</i>

3
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:09,760
were ambushed
by a Dominion patrol

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,010
near the Badlands.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,554
Worf was commanding
the<i> Koraga.</i>

6
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:13,681
It didn't make it.

7
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:15,140
Let's get married.

8
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,058
Do you mean it?

9
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:18,727
I love you.

10
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,228
Does Weyoun know
you're here?

11
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:24,566
Ah, I see he still has
you under his thumb.

12
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,025
We have a problem.

13
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:27,611
It's Ezri-- there's
a runabout missing.

14
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,404
She must have gotten
it into her head

15
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,572
to go looking
for Worf.

16
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,701
They're coming in
behind us.

17
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,208
The vaccine--
how is it progressing?

18
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,961
I regret
that it failed to stabilize

19
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,754
the latest sample you provided.

20
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,172
I can't believe
I'm stuck here with you.

21
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,757
Perhaps you would

22
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,301
rather be back on the station
with Captain Boday.

23
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,730
That surgeon
you recommended

24
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,232
does excellent work.

25
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:12,781
Your path is a difficult one.

26
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,743
She cannot
share it with you.

27
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:17,786
I want to spend
my life with her.

28
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:21,623
If you do, you will know
nothing but sorrow.

29
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,753
<i>And now, the continuation.</i>

30
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:33,635
Did they tell you
why you can't marry Kasidy?

31
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,763
The Prophets didn't
say that I can't.

32
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:38,139
They just said that I shouldn't.

33
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,059
It-it's the same thing.

34
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:42,352
I-I don't see
why it's any of their business.

35
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,688
Everything I do
is their business.

36
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,069
Have you told Kasidy?

37
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:52,071
No, she's on a cargo run.

38
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:53,655
She won't be back
for a couple of days.

39
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,698
And when
she gets back

40
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,450
what are you
going to tell her?

41
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,160
That some Prophet who said
that she's your mother, Sarah

42
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,621
told you not to marry her?

43
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,707
Jake, you're not making me
feel any better.

44
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:06,668
KIRA (<i> on com</i> ):
Captain Sisko,
Kai Winn is here to see you.

45
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,631
Send her in.

46
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,299
Talk later.

47
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,976
Emissary, congratulations.

48
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:23,560
Eminence.

49
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,228
I'm so happy for you.

50
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:29,190
This wedding is
a momentous event for Bajor.

51
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,693
I want to make sure
the proceedings

52
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,862
reflect its importance

53
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,865
so I've come to assist
in the preparations.

54
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,199
Hmm.

55
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,243
That's very kind of you

56
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:43,664
but I'm not sure
that it's necessary.

57
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,082
Well, you don't
have to thank me.

58
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,708
I'm glad to do it.

59
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,710
I understand that
you've asked

60
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,338
Vedek Telna to perform
the ceremony.

61
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:54,049
Perhaps you thought
I would be unavailable

62
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,760
but since I'm here,
I think you'll agree

63
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,804
it would be more
appropriate for me

64
00:02:58,804 --> 00:02:59,847
to do it.

65
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,348
I'll talk to
Vedek Telna

66
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:04,267
and I'm sure he'd be
willing to step aside.

67
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,938
Well, these
are joyful days indeed.

68
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:11,859
You've given the Prophets
reason to smile.

69
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,988
Is there something
wrong, Emissary?

70
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:17,906
You seem troubled.

71
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,826
The Prophets
came to me in a vision.

72
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,870
I see.

73
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,287
They warned me

74
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,041
that I was going to have
to face a great trial.

75
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,668
Did they say what it would be?

76
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,879
I'm afraid not.

77
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,756
The Prophets don't always
make themselves clear.

78
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,341
Well, I wouldn't know

79
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,386
as they've never spoken
to me directly.

80
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,138
In any case

81
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:44,599
you have always been willing
to do whatever it is they ask.

82
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,769
Well... I pray that
they'll give you

83
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,897
the strength to
face your trial.

84
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,232
I sense you're
going to need it.

85
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,274
Emissary.

86
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,526
Eminence.

87
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,367
May I show you
to your quarters?

88
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,953
Well, thank you, my child.

89
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,332
(<i> heartbeat thumping</i> )

90
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,793
Her<i> pagh</i> is strong.

91
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:12,961
Solbor?

92
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,297
She will serve us well.

93
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,016
Prophets...

94
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,936
(<i> sighs</i> )

95
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:32,898
I have waited so long
for you to speak to me.

96
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,692
How can I serve you?

97
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,736
The Sisko has faltered.

98
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,030
You must bring the Restoration.

99
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,116
The Restoration?

100
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:43,909
Bajor's fate rests with you.

101
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,202
Tell me what to do.

102
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,537
The Guide will reveal the way.

103
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,790
What Guide?

104
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,166
He will come to you.

105
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,960
How will I know him?

106
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,254
He will have the wisdom
of the land.

107
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:56,964
Of the land?

108
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:01,093
I don't understand.

109
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:03,762
Only you can bring
the Restoration.

110
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:06,431
Bajor's fate rests with you.

111
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,350
KIRA:
Eminence...

112
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,435
are you all right?

113
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,437
What happened?

114
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,318
The Prophets...

115
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,904
they spoke to me.

116
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,992
They will be feeding us soon.

117
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:34,413
If we could position ourselves
on both sides of the door

118
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:35,705
we might be able to disarm

119
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,416
the first Breen
that comes through.

120
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,666
Worf.

121
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,210
Face it.

122
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,587
The "Guard, my cellmate
is ill" trick didn't work.

123
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,631
Neither did your
"I'll make a tool

124
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,591
and short-circuit the door"
idea.

125
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,551
We must not give up.

126
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:52,055
The first duty of every captured
officer is to attempt escape.

127
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,640
(<i> door opens</i> )

128
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,606
What's the special today?

129
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,780
Algae paste, my favorite.

130
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,536
I wonder what the Breen
look like under those helmets.

131
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,747
They say no one
has ever seen one

132
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,624
and lived
to speak of it.

133
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,584
Maybe they're all furry.

134
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,878
It's supposed to be
very cold on Breen.

135
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,173
Well, one thing
is certain...

136
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:29,050
They're horrible cooks?

137
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,762
They are dangerous.

138
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,682
They do not tolerate
incursions into their space.

139
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,558
During the Second Empire

140
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:40,603
Chancellor Mow'ga sent
a fleet of Klingon ships

141
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,938
to conquer their homeworld

142
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,815
and they were never
heard from again.

143
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,654
We have been traveling
for three days.

144
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,657
We could be in
Breen space by now.

145
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,162
Well, I wouldn't
rule out the possibility

146
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,872
that they saw
our shuttle crash

147
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,166
and decided to take us back
to Deep Space 9.

148
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,087
You are being humorous.

149
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,924
Not very, I guess.

150
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:14,679
Jadzia also used humor
to lift her spirits.

151
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,182
You didn't laugh very much
at her jokes, either.

152
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,686
You<i> are</i> a
lot like her.

153
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,605
In some ways.

154
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:36,159
I thought
that I had lost her forever

155
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,703
but you and I
will have

156
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,830
many years together.

157
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,806
(<i> snoring</i> )

158
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,987
Damar.

159
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,490
(<i> snoring continues</i> )

160
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,450
Damar!

161
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,700
(<i> yells</i> )

162
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,955
What are you doing here?

163
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,040
Since you're ignoring
your com system

164
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,666
I decided to wake you myself.

165
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,669
(<i> groans softly</i> )

166
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,131
I worked late last night.

167
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,758
Yes...

168
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,136
I can see that.

169
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,637
Get yourself cleaned up.

170
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,848
We're leaving
this afternoon.

171
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,683
Where are we going?

172
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,644
You needn't concern
yourself with that.

173
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,147
Why didn't you
tell me that before?

174
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,898
I have things to tend to.

175
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,067
You mean your
business with Dukat?

176
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:57,240
Did you really think
I didn't know he was here?

177
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,200
Masquerading as a Bajoran.

178
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,120
What's he up to this time?

179
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,955
He wouldn't say.

180
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,625
Yet, you helped him
all the same.

181
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,876
Such loyalty.

182
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,838
It would be impressive
if it wasn't so misplaced.

183
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,514
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

184
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,749
Have you arranged
my transportation?

185
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,628
And your identity documents.

186
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,797
Good. I knew I could
count on you.

187
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,511
You don't
look well.

188
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,762
I'm fine.

189
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:06,100
What happened to that brave
officer I served with?

190
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,687
The one who stood at my side
while we fought

191
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:11,981
the entire Klingon Empire
with a single ship?

192
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,776
Those were
simpler times.

193
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,572
Those days
might be gone

194
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:21,908
but the man
I served with isn't.

195
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,703
He's still within you.

196
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,206
Reach in and grab
hold of him, Damar.

197
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:31,959
Cardassia needs a leader.

198
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,421
You were its
leader once.

199
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:35,589
You could be again.

200
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:39,050
Mm-mm. The Pah-wraiths
have shown me

201
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,927
that I have
a different destiny.

202
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,681
Good luck, old friend.

203
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,065
And to you.

204
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,588
(<i> sighs</i> )

205
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,561
The Bajorans believe
it's good luck

206
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,812
for a bride to wear
a Navatan shawl.

207
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,857
What's the matter?

208
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,777
You don't like it.

209
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,073
It's lovely.

210
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,866
Then why the long face?

211
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,079
We need to talk.

212
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,959
Why do I have a feeling
I'm not going to like this?

213
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,673
There's something
I haven't told you.

214
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,844
A few days ago

215
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:09,056
one of the Prophets
came to me in a vision.

216
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,351
It was Sarah.

217
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,227
Your mother?

218
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,854
What did she want?

219
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,902
She said the path
that I was meant to walk...

220
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,533
is for me alone.

221
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,412
That you<i> can't</i> 
walk it with me.

222
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,542
Why?

223
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,127
She said I would
know nothing but sorrow

224
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,046
if I ignored her warning.

225
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:43,341
Well, that almost
sounds like a threat.

226
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,676
No.

227
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:47,679
It wasn't anything like that.

228
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,349
She was<i> worried</i> for me.

229
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,893
Like a mother
would be.

230
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,862
What are you going to do?

231
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,448
Kasidy, the Prophets

232
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,367
see things
that we can't.

233
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,993
If she was
that concerned

234
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,912
it must be for
a good reason.

235
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,833
You're not answering
my question.

236
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,167
Kasidy...

237
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,379
I love you...

238
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:25,049
and I want to be with you.

239
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,552
Then be with me, Ben.

240
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,516
I can't.

241
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,940
I can't go against the Prophets.

242
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,703
Kasidy, please.

243
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,580
Try and understand.

244
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:32,951
No!

245
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,119
(<i> moaning</i> )

246
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,705
No!

247
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,166
Ezri!

248
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,542
No!

249
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,419
It is all right.

250
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,045
You were having
a bad dream.

251
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,589
Where are we?

252
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,842
We're still aboard
the Breen ship.

253
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:52,052
They were chasing me...

254
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,972
in an ice cave.

255
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,807
It was so cold,
I could barely breathe.

256
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,184
Shh! It is over now.

257
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,772
I couldn't
get away from them.

258
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,024
Every time I looked back,
they were right behind me

259
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:09,445
and then one of them
grabbed me with this huge claw.

260
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,699
The Breen do
not have claws.

261
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,368
How do you know?

262
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,662
Besides,
it-it was a dream.

263
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,413
Dreams are full of things
that don't make sense.

264
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,249
That is why
it is best to ignore them.

265
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,710
How can you say that?

266
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,586
Dreams contain
valuable insights.

267
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,672
Things that don't seem
to make any sense

268
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,549
are actually the key
to what your unconscious

269
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,009
is trying
to tell you.

270
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,510
Anyway, I got
away from him...

271
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,014
but then,
there was nowhere to run

272
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:39,642
and then, just when I thought
he was about to kill me

273
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:44,022
he reached up
and took off his helmet...

274
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,357
And?

275
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,985
And...

276
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,737
it was Julian.

277
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,907
Dr. Bashir.

278
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,036
Isn't that strange?

279
00:17:58,036 --> 00:17:59,829
I wonder what it meant?

280
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,040
Dr. Bashir
is a Breen.

281
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,417
Very funny.

282
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:08,421
Now, the cave could
symbolize the womb.

283
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,924
Maybe my subconscious
is trying to tell me

284
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,926
that I need
to confront emotions

285
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,928
that I've repressed
since birth.

286
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,429
But which one?

287
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,472
I've been born
nine times.

288
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,225
This is ridiculous.

289
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,852
I'm a Counselor.

290
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,854
Analyzing dreams
is part of my job.

291
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:27,774
Jadzia never talked
about<i> her</i> dreams.

292
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,692
Well, I'm not Jadzia, am I?

293
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:36,115
(<i> electronically</i>
<i>distorted voices</i> )

294
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,116
(<i> grunts</i> )

295
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,701
Worf!
(<i> cries out</i> )

296
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,625
Where are you taking him?

297
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,806
WINN:
...have mercy upon
your humble supplicant

298
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:03,392
and make me worthy
of your great task.

299
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,395
Grant me the strength
not to fail you.

300
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,864
(<i> door opens</i> )

301
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,157
SOLBOR:
Eminence?

302
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,117
Yes?

303
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:20,534
There is a man here

304
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,787
who requests an
audience with you.

305
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,163
Show him in.

306
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,629
This is
Anjohl Tennan

307
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,923
from Relliketh.

308
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,758
Welcome, my son.

309
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:38,636
Thank you for
seeing me, Eminence.

310
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,763
How can I help you?

311
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,765
I've come to ask your blessing

312
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:47,937
so that I may have prosperity
in the coming season.

313
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,897
What is it you do?

314
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:54,652
Oh, I'm just a simple man
of the land.

315
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,281
Of the land?

316
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,534
I'm a farmer.

317
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,077
I grow<i> moba</i> and...

318
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,710
Your<i> pagh</i> is strong, Anjohl.

319
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,590
I've been waiting for you.

320
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,980
Oh, here, let me help you.

321
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,732
It's not right that a Ranjen

322
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,650
should be serving
a common farmer.

323
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,609
Please sit.

324
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,903
You're our guest.

325
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:49,707
If I told my neighbors
I was having tea with the Kai

326
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,418
they'd never believe me.

327
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,379
Thank you, Solbor.

328
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,630
Thank you.

329
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,427
Tell me about
yourself, Anjohl.

330
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:04,430
You came here to
pray for prosperity.

331
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,767
Have things been
difficult for you?

332
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,602
Yes.

333
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:14,314
Rogath blight destroyed
my entire crop last year.

334
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,316
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

335
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,401
Most of the farms

336
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,820
in Relliketh
fell victim to it.

337
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,908
"And the land shall be
poisoned by a great evil."

338
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:30,248
It's from the Ancient Texts--
Talnot's Prophesy

339
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:31,540
of the Final Days.

340
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,792
I see.

341
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,294
Well...

342
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,421
tell me more about this blight.

343
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:42,509
Unfortunately,
the only way to eradicate it

344
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,429
is to burn your fields
at the first sign

345
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,764
of contamination.

346
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,432
Go on.

347
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,602
Then you must let
your land lie fallow

348
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:54,730
for a whole season
to allow

349
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,816
for the restoration
of the soil.

350
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,987
Restoration...

351
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,529
The following year

352
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,365
the fields<i> will</i> be
fertile again.

353
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:10,579
"The poison must be purged away
so the land can be reborn."

354
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,039
Eminence?

355
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,917
Do you pray to the
Prophets, Anjohl?

356
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,794
Oh, every day.

357
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:19,379
And have they
ever answered you?

358
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:22,591
In a vision or
in your dreams?

359
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,593
Oh, there have been times

360
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:28,889
when I thought
I could feel their presence.

361
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,935
But spoken to me? No.

362
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,729
Surely, they'd reserve
such a blessing

363
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,397
for someone like you.

364
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,567
Well, you are right.

365
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,695
They<i> have</i> spoken to me

366
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,865
and they told me they were going
to send you here.

367
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:49,702
Me?

368
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:50,786
You've been

369
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,621
blessed, Anjohl.

370
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,708
They've anointed you
to be my Guide.

371
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,879
(<i> gasps</i> )

372
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,298
I don't understand.

373
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:05,843
You are going to help me
bring about the Restoration

374
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,345
of Bajor.

375
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:09,805
But surely the Prophets
would have chosen

376
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,350
someone more worthy than I.

377
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,936
You must have more faith
in yourself, Anjohl

378
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,938
and in the Prophets.

379
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,318
Of course.

380
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,444
And rest assured,
they'll reveal

381
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:27,073
what they want from us

382
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:30,659
and together, we will walk
the path they've laid out.

383
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,413
Ah, the bottom line is

384
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:36,540
the Chief won't be able
to get to it

385
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,541
for a few days.

386
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,542
Not good enough.

387
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,211
I told General Martok

388
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,213
his ships would be repaired
by tomorrow.

389
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:44,798
We have engineering crews
working 26 hours a day.

390
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,885
We're doing the best we can.

391
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,053
I-I know you are.

392
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:53,515
It's just that things are...

393
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:56,434
a little complicated for me now.

394
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,396
I can imagine.

395
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,399
Nerys...

396
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,487
the Prophets came to me...

397
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,823
and told me that...

398
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,326
Kasidy and I...

399
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:15,746
are not meant
to walk the same path.

400
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:18,916
Ah.

401
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,918
I see.

402
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:23,545
Well, that explains that.

403
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,838
I'm sorry

404
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,715
but the Prophets
wouldn't ask you

405
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,092
to do something
like that

406
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,509
without a reason.

407
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,345
You would think
they would tell me what it is.

408
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:34,432
It doesn't work like that,
and you know that.

409
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:40,896
Well, what they're asking
you to do isn't easy

410
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,815
but they've
never led you

411
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:43,774
down the wrong path.

412
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,692
Not so far.

413
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:48,446
There's always a first time.

414
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,366
To them, I'm "the Sisko"

415
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,576
an instrument
to carry out their wishes

416
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:57,371
but they forget
that I am also human

417
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:59,415
with dreams and wishes
of my own.

418
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:02,209
They say that marrying
Kasidy is a mistake.

419
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:05,087
Maybe it is,
but it's my mistake to make.

420
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,923
I wouldn't go
against the Prophets.

421
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,758
You're doing
the right thing.

422
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:32,572
Founder.

423
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,658
When do we reach
the rendezvous coordinates?

424
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,910
Approximately
36 hours.

425
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,497
May I say
your plan is brilliant?

426
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:42,166
I'm confident that it will
turn the war in our favor.

427
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,251
Let's hope
that you're right.

428
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,503
(<i> gasping</i> )

429
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:47,087
Founder?

430
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:50,924
About Damar-- I trust
he won't be a problem.

431
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,385
I'm sure he'll
have his concerns

432
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:54,220
but you needn't
worry about that.

433
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,804
I'll deal with him
when the time comes.

434
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,348
See that you do.

435
00:25:57,348 --> 00:26:00,059
I find him most trying.

436
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,227
I'll have
the temperature lowered.

437
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:03,020
You'll be more
comfortable.

438
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,572
Fight them!

439
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:15,699
<i>Sto-Vo-Kor!</i>

440

(<i> growls</i> )

441
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,160
Worf!

442
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,870
No! No!

443
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,788
I will not dishonor
her memory!

444
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,707
(<i> gasping</i> )

445
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,292
What have they
done to you?

446
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,461
Alexander!

447
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:31,465
Worf... wake up, please.

448
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:34,301
(<i> sighs</i> )

449
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,386
Ezri...

450
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,398
Where did they take you?

451
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,734
An interrogation chamber.

452
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,986
(<i> groaning</i> )

453
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:56,698
They used some sort of...

454
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,577
cortical implant
to probe my memory.

455
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:01,619
I wonder what they were
trying to find out.

456
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,122
I do<i> not</i> know.

457
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,665
I lost consciousness.

458
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:08,001
That's probably a good thing.

459
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,879
I should have tried harder
to resist them.

460
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,465
(<i> groaning</i> )

461
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,133
Careful.

462
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,927
These Breen are
without honor.

463
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:18,720
Worf, sit down please.

464
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,721
Have something to eat.

465
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,265
This is intolerable!

466
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:23,058
They have us caged
up like animals.

467
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,518
Stop it.

468
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,686
A Klingon would rather
die than be held captive.

469
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:27,896
What are you going to do?

470
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,064
Kill yourself
and leave me here alone?

471
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,648
This is no time
for your jokes!

472
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:33,611
It's no time for Klingon
chest-thumping either.

(<i> door opens</i> )

474
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:40,909
Stop it!

475
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,496
(<i> groaning</i> )

476
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,259
More spring wine?

477
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,511
Yes.

478
00:27:58,511 --> 00:27:59,761
It's extraordinary.

479
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,888
I've never tasted
anything like this.

480
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:05,725
Well, it's a rare vintage
from before the occupation.

481
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,811
I was going to
give this bottle

482
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,105
to the Emissary
as a wedding gift.

483
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,940
Well, I'm honored

484
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,360
that you would choose
to share it with me.

485
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,613
Well, I doubt that he
would have been able

486
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:20,407
to appreciate it as much,
not being a Bajoran.

487
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:24,620
I suppose not.

488
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,999
The Prophets may have chosen
to speak<i> through</i> him, but...

489
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:34,213
he's not really one of us,
is he?

490
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,593
No. No, he isn't.

491
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,851
There are times...

492
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:51,146
when I wonder if he truly
understands our people.

493
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:55,484
Still, it's not
for me to question

494
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:59,655
why the Prophets chose
him as their Emissary.

495
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:03,617
You forget the Prophets
chose you as my Guide.

496
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:06,119
You must speak
your mind freely, Anjohl.

497
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,372
(<i> sighs</i> )

498
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:12,125
The Emissary didn't suffer
through the occupation.

499
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:15,879
He has no idea what the
Cardassians did to us.

500
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:21,093
Those years left many scars
on Bajor's soul.

501
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:26,139
So... how can he help heal...

502
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:29,142
what he could never comprehend?

503
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:32,730
I have often asked myself
the same question.

504
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,359
I survived the occupation
purely by chance.

505
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,069
Tell me.

506
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:42,114
When the resistance destroyed

507
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:45,075
the Cardassian outpost
in Relliketh

508
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:48,370
Gul Dukat ordered 100 Bajorans

509
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,996
rounded up.

510
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:52,958
His intention was to
send us to the capital

511
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,043
for public execution.

512
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:58,088
100 from Relliketh?

513
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,423
Mm.

514
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,258
When did that occur?

515
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:05,011
Just before the Great Famine.

516
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,013
By sheer luck

517
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:10,309
my transport was rerouted
to a labor camp

518
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:13,604
and I learned years later

519
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:16,649
that the dispatcher
had misread the orders.

520
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:17,775
(<i> chuckles</i> )

521
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,236
Well, his name was Prenar

522
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,029
and he didn't

523
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,948
misread the orders.

524
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,412
How could you know that?

525
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:36,669
I was a Ranjen at that time.

526
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:39,421
I convinced the Vedek
who led my Order

527
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:43,717
that we needed to take a more
active role in the resistance.

528
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:46,762
He allowed me to remove
some gemstones

529
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:48,597
from our tabernacle.

530
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:51,266
I used those
to bribe various

531
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:56,730
Cardassians in exchange
for some small acts of leniency.

532
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:00,693
Prenar was one of them.

533
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:05,364
I paid him to reroute
the transport from Relliketh.

534
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:16,542
You saved my life.

535
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,379
Even then...

536
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,506
our fates were linked.

537
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,730
(<i> door chimes</i> )

538
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:41,692
(<i> door chimes</i> )

539
00:31:41,692 --> 00:31:43,485
Yes.

540
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:50,492
Uh, sorry to interrupt,
but I have something for you.

541
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:51,744
The, uh...

542
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:57,332
the item
that you ordered.

543
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:07,634
Terellian diamonds aren't
that easy to come by

544
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,261
especially with this war on.

545
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:12,723
Needless to say,
it was non-refundable.

546
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,768
Thank you, Quark.

547
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,525
Um...

548
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:26,486
seems a shame to let
something so beautiful

549
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,821
go to waste.

550
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,913

(<i> groans</i> )

552
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,688
I'm going to help you
through this, Garak.

553
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:10,739
(<i> muttering and groaning</i> )

554
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,453
I'm not just saying this
because I'm your sister.

555
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:18,664
You have a gift.

556
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,916
(<i> moans</i> )

557
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,671
No more algae paste.

558
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,846
I'm not like you.

559
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:35,388
I'm not like you, Joran.

560
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,556
I'm not a murderer.

561
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,810
Shh.

562
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,436
It's all right.

563
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,442
I was your wife.

564
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,778
Why don't you talk to me?

565
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,535
I love you.

566
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,375
Kiss me.

567
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:06,003
Kiss me, Julian.

568
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,532
(<i> door chimes</i> )

569
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:37,158
Yes?

570
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,702
SOLBOR (<i> on com</i> ):
Forgive me for disturbing you

571
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,495
at this hour, Eminence

572
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,916
but Anjohl is here,
and he insists on seeing you.

573
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,375
I'll be right there.

574
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,304
ANJOHL:
Eminence

575
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,223
I hope I didn't
wake you.

576
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,683
That's all right.

577
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,311
You may go, Solbor.

578
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,356
As you wish.

579
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,575
Something wondrous

580
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,368
has happened.

581
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,287
I talked to my brother
in Relliketh.

582
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,163
He told me that
this morning

583
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:26,625
when he went out to
inspect the fields

584
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:30,295
he found<i> mobasaplings</i> 
sprouting from the soil.

585
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,213
But it's impossible.

586
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,299
We only planted
last week.

587
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,551
Tell me...

588
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,845
could it be a sign?

589
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:43,558
Yes, it<i> is</i> a sign...

590
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,978
a sign from the Prophets.

591
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:48,229
They're telling you
that your farm

592
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:51,190
will thrive
under your brother's care.

593
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,735
They don't want you
to go back to Relliketh.

594
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:57,072
They want you at my side.

595
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:02,535
Then this is where
I'll stay, Eminence.

596
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:05,538
Adami.

597
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,292
Adami.

598
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:14,213
What a beautiful name.

599
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:18,802
It's all right.

600
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,265
The Prophets brought
us together.

601
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,822
That's the last of it.

602
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:40,615
Tell Kilby to start the
final departure check.

603
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,700
Yes, ma'am.

604
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,127
I made a mistake.

605
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,004
I don't care what
the Prophets want.

606
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:55,588
I want to marry you.

607
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,215
We'll worry
about the rest later.

608
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:00,969
Ben, don't do this to me--

609
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:03,638
not if you're going
to change your mind again.

610
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,931
I won't.

611
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,391
I love you.

612
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,313
Okay, let's go.

613
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,648
Where?

614
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,067
Where do you think?

615
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,914
Didn't think
you were going to make it.

616
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:30,623
I only heard about
it 20 minutes ago.

617
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,500
Me, too, and I'm the caterer.

618
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,045
Thank you, Quark.

619
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,089
I can't work
under these conditions.

620
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:38,924
Too bad Ezri and Worf
couldn't be here.

621
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:41,300
Well, they probably
got held up

622
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,053
picking out a wedding gift.

623
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,685
Something for you, Nog?

624
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,855
Usually when we come
to events like this

625
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,815
you're the one who
has to remind<i> me</i>

626
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,400
to smile.

627
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:04,199
I wonder why they decided
not to have a Bajoran ceremony.

628
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,245
I hope the Prophets
forgive them.

629
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:10,038
So do I.

630
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:12,749
(<i> boson's whistle sounds</i> )

631
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,547
You look beautiful.

632
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,216
Thank you.

633
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,305
Well done, Nog.

634
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:30,142
Considering I only had
a few minutes to practice.

635
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,527
One of the most pleasant duties
of a senior officer

636
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:44,864
is the privilege of joining
two people together

637
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,491
in matrimony.

638
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:50,453
Today, I have the honor
to unite Kasidy Danielle Yates

639
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:54,082
and Benjamin Lafayette Sisko
in marriage.

640
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:57,294
Kasidy, do you accept this man
as your husband

641
00:38:57,294 --> 00:39:00,088
to love and cherish
above all others

642
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,048
until death separates you?

643
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,009
I do.

644
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:09,181
Benjamin, do you accept
this woman as your wife

645
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:11,183
to love and cherish her

646
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:14,019
above all others
until death separates you?

647
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:17,856
I do.

648
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,192
These rings

649
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:22,986
are a symbol of your love
for each other

650
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:25,822
and a promise to abide
by the vows

651
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:27,199
you've made today.

652
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:37,000
With this ring, I thee wed.

653
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,130
With this ring...

654
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,592
This is not meant
to be, Benjamin.

655
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,261
I've made my decision.

656
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:50,638
Your trial is at hand.

657
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,932
You must be strong.

658
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,018
Kasidy<i> gives</i> me strength.

659
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:56,978
Why can't you understand that?

660
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:58,938
If you do this

661
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,440
you will know
only sorrow.

662
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,944
You shared
my mother's existence.

663
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:08,865
You must have some
idea what love is.

664
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:11,534
You should know that
I will never be happy

665
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,286
without Kasidy.

666
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:15,788
Your path is a difficult one.

667
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:24,297
I cannot change...

668
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,007
what is to come.

669
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,675
I know.

670
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:34,140
Be careful...

671
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,102
my son.

672
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,565
Ben?

673
00:40:48,238 --> 00:40:49,655
With this ring...

674
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,411
I thee wed.

675
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:00,083
By the power vested in me

676
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:02,294
by the United Federation
of Planets...

677
00:41:02,294 --> 00:41:05,463
I pronounce you
husband and wife.

678
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,090
(<i> applause</i> )

679
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,647
I need to talk to you.

680
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,483
Oh?

681
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,361
I demand to know
where we are going.

682
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,699
Of course.

683
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:34,951
In fact, I was just coming

684
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:36,869
to your quarters
to discuss the matter.

685
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,413
Were you?

686
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:41,416
I've kept you in the dark
for too long, Damar

687
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:44,043
and for that, I apologize.

688
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:47,005
You are the leader of Cardassia

689
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,548
and you deserve to know
everything we're doing

690
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:53,719
and I have a feeling

691
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,638
you're going to be very pleased.

692
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,982
Would you stop that?

693
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,987
What's wrong?

694
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:13,072
You haven't said a
word to me in hours.

695
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,244
I should not have trusted you
with my heart.

696
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,789
What is that supposed to mean?

697
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,376
You dishonor me and yourself.

698
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:29,214
I must have missed something
when I was gone.

699
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:31,424
How long have you had
these feelings for him?

700
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:32,633
For who?

701
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:33,885
Dr. Bashir.

702
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,594
What?
When the Breen

703
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,930
brought you back,
you spoke his name.

704
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,598
I did?

705
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:41,809
Yes.
You said that you loved him.

706
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,603
Julian?

707
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,272
I said that I loved Julian?

708
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:48,066
Do not try to deny it.

709
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:50,402
Oh, Worf.

710
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:57,658
Look, I admit that I find him
to be... charming...

711
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:01,538
and obviously, he is an
attractive man, but I'm not...

712
00:43:01,538 --> 00:43:02,955
You<i> are</i> in love
with him!

713
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,541
I am<i> not!</i>

714
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:05,708
Then why do you
dream about him?

715
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,504
You're the one that said
that dreams don't mean anything.

716
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:11,214
I should've known.

717
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:12,840
Jadzia had feelings for him
as well.

718
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,676
Would you
stop comparing me to her!

719
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:16,677

720
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:19,722
(<i> distorted voices</i> )

721
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,566
We meet at last.

722
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:32,277
(<i> distorted voices</i> )

723
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:33,361
Gifts?

724
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:37,907
How thoughtful.

725
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:40,618
You should be honored.

726
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,621
You're witnessing
an historic moment--

727
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,331
the birth of the alliance

728
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:48,960
between the Dominion
