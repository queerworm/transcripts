1
00:00:02,265 --> 00:00:05,296
Last time on
<i>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...</i>

2
00:00:07,244 --> 00:00:08,474
The <i>Rotarran</i> and the <i>Koraga</i>

3
00:00:08,514 --> 00:00:10,040
were ambushed
by a Dominion patrol

4
00:00:10,084 --> 00:00:11,178
near the Badlands.

5
00:00:11,288 --> 00:00:12,883
Worf was commanding
the <i>Koraga.</i>

6
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:13,951
It didn't make it.

7
00:00:13,994 --> 00:00:15,429
Let's get married.

8
00:00:15,465 --> 00:00:17,368
Do you mean it?

9
00:00:17,404 --> 00:00:19,068
I love you.

10
00:00:19,108 --> 00:00:20,543
Does Weyoun know
you're here?

11
00:00:20,578 --> 00:00:24,885
Ah, I see he still has
you under his thumb.

12
00:00:24,923 --> 00:00:26,085
We have a problem.

13
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,721
It's Ezri... there's
a runabout missing.

14
00:00:27,763 --> 00:00:29,631
She must have gotten
it into her head

15
00:00:29,668 --> 00:00:30,864
to go looking for Worf.

16
00:00:32,676 --> 00:00:34,202
They're coming in behind us.

17
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:41,555
The vaccine...
how is it progressing?

18
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:44,265
I regret
that it failed to stabilize

19
00:00:44,307 --> 00:00:46,210
the latest sample you provided.

20
00:00:46,245 --> 00:00:48,045
I can't believe
I'm stuck here with you.

21
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,177
Perhaps you would

22
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,590
rather be back on the station
with Captain Boday.

23
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:03,115
That surgeon
you recommended

24
00:01:03,156 --> 00:01:05,754
does excellent work.

25
00:01:10,475 --> 00:01:13,175
Your path is a difficult one.

26
00:01:13,215 --> 00:01:16,189
She cannot share it with you.

27
00:01:16,223 --> 00:01:18,217
I want to spend
my life with her.

28
00:01:18,261 --> 00:01:22,203
If you do, you will know
nothing but sorrow.

29
00:01:24,143 --> 00:01:26,342
And now, the continuation.

30
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,226
Did they tell you
why you can't marry Kasidy?

31
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,332
The Prophets didn't
say that I can't.

32
00:01:36,442 --> 00:01:38,778
They just said that I shouldn't.

33
00:01:38,815 --> 00:01:40,843
It-it's the same thing.

34
00:01:40,887 --> 00:01:42,858
I-I don't see
why it's any of their business.

35
00:01:42,892 --> 00:01:45,056
Everything I do
is their business.

36
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:50,538
Have you told Kasidy?

37
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,847
No, she's on a cargo run.

38
00:01:52,884 --> 00:01:54,787
She won't be back
for a couple of days.

39
00:01:54,822 --> 00:01:55,791
And when she gets back

40
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:57,021
what are you
going to tell her?

41
00:01:57,062 --> 00:01:59,830
That some Prophet who said
that she's your mother, Sarah

42
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,168
told you not to marry her?

43
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:04,078
Jake, you're not making me
feel any better.

44
00:02:04,113 --> 00:02:07,212
Captain Sisko,
Kai Winn is here to see you.

45
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:11,191
Send her in.

46
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:13,066
Talk later.

47
00:02:19,922 --> 00:02:22,828
Emissary, congratulations.

48
00:02:22,862 --> 00:02:24,024
Eminence.

49
00:02:24,065 --> 00:02:25,899
I'm so happy for you.

50
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:29,879
This wedding is
a momentous event for Bajor.

51
00:02:29,913 --> 00:02:32,351
I want to make sure
the proceedings

52
00:02:32,387 --> 00:02:34,415
reflect its importance

53
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:37,695
so I've come to assist
in the preparations.

54
00:02:37,734 --> 00:02:38,896
Hmm.

55
00:02:38,937 --> 00:02:40,999
That's very kind of you

56
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:44,245
but I'm not sure
that it's necessary.

57
00:02:44,284 --> 00:02:45,776
Well, you don't
have to thank me.

58
00:02:45,822 --> 00:02:47,348
I'm glad to do it.

59
00:02:47,392 --> 00:02:49,454
I understand that
you've asked

60
00:02:49,498 --> 00:02:51,970
Vedek Telna to perform
the ceremony.

61
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,807
Perhaps you thought
I would be unavailable

62
00:02:54,845 --> 00:02:57,477
but since I'm here,
I think you'll agree

63
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:59,387
it would be more
appropriate for me

64
00:02:59,424 --> 00:03:00,484
to do it.

65
00:03:00,526 --> 00:03:02,018
I'll talk to Vedek Telna

66
00:03:02,064 --> 00:03:04,866
and I'm sure he'd be
willing to step aside.

67
00:03:04,904 --> 00:03:08,607
Well, these
are joyful days indeed.

68
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:12,384
You've given the Prophets
reason to smile.

69
00:03:14,497 --> 00:03:16,593
Is there something wrong,
Emissary?

70
00:03:16,635 --> 00:03:18,469
You seem troubled.

71
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,411
The Prophets
came to me in a vision.

72
00:03:21,448 --> 00:03:23,716
I see.

73
00:03:23,753 --> 00:03:24,881
They warned me

74
00:03:24,923 --> 00:03:27,657
that I was going to have
to face a great trial.

75
00:03:27,697 --> 00:03:30,261
Did they say what it would be?

76
00:03:30,304 --> 00:03:32,400
I'm afraid not.

77
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:35,416
The Prophets don't always
make themselves clear.

78
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,010
Well, I wouldn't know

79
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:39,995
as they've never spoken
to me directly.

80
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:41,624
In any case

81
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:45,336
you have always been willing
to do whatever it is they ask.

82
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:48,214
Well... I pray that
they'll give you

83
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:50,689
the strength to
face your trial.

84
00:03:50,724 --> 00:03:52,888
I sense you're
going to need it.

85
00:03:52,929 --> 00:03:54,091
Emissary.

86
00:03:54,132 --> 00:03:55,328
Eminence.

87
00:04:01,953 --> 00:04:03,047
May I show you
to your quarters?

88
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:05,561
Well, thank you, my child.

89
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,442
Her <i>pagh</i> is strong.

90
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,813
Solbor?

91
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:17,120
She will serve us well.

92
00:04:25,314 --> 00:04:26,874
Prophets...

93
00:04:29,725 --> 00:04:33,599
I have waited so long
for you to speak to me.

94
00:04:33,635 --> 00:04:36,335
How can I serve you?

95
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,369
The Sisko has faulted.

96
00:04:38,414 --> 00:04:40,613
You must bring the Restoration.

97
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,850
The Restoration?

98
00:04:42,892 --> 00:04:44,590
Bajor's fate rests with you.

99
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,860
Tell me what to do.

100
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,270
The Guide will reveal the way.

101
00:04:48,307 --> 00:04:50,506
What Guide?

102
00:04:50,545 --> 00:04:51,878
He will come to you.

103
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:53,647
How will I know him?

104
00:04:53,754 --> 00:04:55,953
He will have the wisdom
of the land.

105
00:04:55,993 --> 00:04:57,623
Of the land?

106
00:04:59,903 --> 00:05:01,806
I don't understand.

107
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:04,473
Only you can bring
the Restoration.

108
00:05:04,515 --> 00:05:07,317
Bajor's fate rests with you.

109
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:10,094
Eminence...

110
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:11,189
are you all right?

111
00:05:11,232 --> 00:05:13,328
What happened?

112
00:05:16,947 --> 00:05:19,249
The Prophets...

113
00:05:19,287 --> 00:05:21,589
they spoke to me.

114
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,017
They will be feeding us soon.

115
00:07:30,052 --> 00:07:33,721
If we could position ourselves
on both sides of the door

116
00:07:33,762 --> 00:07:34,788
we might be able to disarm

117
00:07:34,832 --> 00:07:36,233
the first Breen
that comes through.

118
00:07:36,268 --> 00:07:37,430
Worf.

119
00:07:37,472 --> 00:07:38,441
Face it.

120
00:07:38,474 --> 00:07:41,414
The "Guard, my cellmate
is ill" trick didn't work.

121
00:07:41,448 --> 00:07:43,442
Neither did your
"I'll make a tool

122
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,423
and short-circuit the door"
idea.

123
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:47,157
We must not give up.

124
00:07:47,196 --> 00:07:51,104
The first duty of every captured
officer is to attempt escape.

125
00:07:58,727 --> 00:08:00,630
What's the special today?

126
00:08:05,143 --> 00:08:07,809
Algae paste, my favorite.

127
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,387
I wonder what the Breen
look like under those helmets.

128
00:08:14,267 --> 00:08:16,671
They say no one
has ever seen one

129
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:18,472
and lived to speak of it.

130
00:08:18,544 --> 00:08:20,481
Maybe they're all furry.

131
00:08:20,517 --> 00:08:22,819
It's supposed to be
very cold on Breen.

132
00:08:22,855 --> 00:08:25,054
Well, one thing
is certain...

133
00:08:25,095 --> 00:08:28,126
They're horrible cooks?

134
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:31,609
They are dangerous.

135
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:34,517
They do not tolerate
incursions into their space.

136
00:08:34,586 --> 00:08:36,250
During the Second Empire

137
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:39,493
Chancellor Mow'ga sent
a fleet of Klingon ships

138
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:40,899
to conquer their homeworld

139
00:08:40,936 --> 00:08:42,930
and they were never
heard from again.

140
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:48,544
We have been traveling
for three days.

141
00:08:48,656 --> 00:08:51,562
We could be in
Breen space by now.

142
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:56,075
Well, I wouldn't
rule out the possibility

143
00:08:56,108 --> 00:08:57,772
that they saw
our shuttle crash

144
00:08:57,813 --> 00:09:00,285
and decided to take us back
to Deep Space 9.

145
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:05,230
You are being humorous.

146
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:08,901
Not very, I guess.

147
00:09:08,942 --> 00:09:13,443
Jadzia also used humor
to lift her spirits.

148
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:16,221
You didn't laugh very much
at her jokes, either.

149
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:20,662
You are a lot like her.

150
00:09:22,076 --> 00:09:23,568
In some ways.

151
00:09:31,234 --> 00:09:35,267
I thought
that I had lost her forever

152
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,782
but you and I will have

153
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:39,481
many years together.

154
00:10:10,101 --> 00:10:12,129
Damar.

155
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:15,582
Damar!

156
00:10:19,726 --> 00:10:21,093
What are you doing here?

157
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:23,123
Since you're ignoring
your com system

158
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:24,762
I decided to wake you myself.

159
00:10:27,813 --> 00:10:30,217
I worked late last night.

160
00:10:30,253 --> 00:10:32,851
Yes...

161
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:35,229
I can see that.

162
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:36,758
Get yourself cleaned up.

163
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:40,004
We're leaving this afternoon.

164
00:10:40,045 --> 00:10:41,879
Where are we going?

165
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,910
You needn't concern
yourself with that.

166
00:10:43,956 --> 00:10:46,292
Why didn't you
tell me that before?

167
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:48,060
I have things to tend to.

168
00:10:48,099 --> 00:10:50,367
You mean your
business with Dukat?

169
00:10:52,845 --> 00:10:56,548
Did you really think
I didn't know he was here?

170
00:10:56,588 --> 00:10:58,582
Masquerading as a Bajoran.

171
00:10:58,627 --> 00:11:01,293
What's he up to this time?

172
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,133
He wouldn't say.

173
00:11:03,171 --> 00:11:05,769
Yet, you helped him
all the same.

174
00:11:05,812 --> 00:11:08,114
Such loyalty.

175
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:11,182
It would be impressive
if it wasn't so misplaced.

176
00:11:45,147 --> 00:11:47,985
Have you arranged
my transportation?

177
00:11:48,021 --> 00:11:50,687
And your identity documents.

178
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:53,998
Good. I knew I could
count on you.

179
00:11:57,112 --> 00:11:58,844
You don't look well.

180
00:11:58,883 --> 00:12:01,047
I'm fine.

181
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:05,362
What happened to that brave
officer I served with?

182
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,964
The one who stood at my side
while we fought

183
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:11,413
the entire Klingon Empire
with a single ship?

184
00:12:12,786 --> 00:12:15,088
Those were simpler times.

185
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,893
Those days might be gone

186
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:21,203
but the man
I served with isn't.

187
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:24,009
He's still within you.

188
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:27,684
Reach in and grab
hold of him, Damar.

189
00:12:27,724 --> 00:12:31,291
Cardassia needs a leader.

190
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,168
You were its leader once.

191
00:12:33,205 --> 00:12:34,697
You could be again.

192
00:12:34,743 --> 00:12:38,378
Mm-mm. The Pah-wraiths
have shown me

193
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:40,413
that I have
a different destiny.

194
00:12:42,663 --> 00:12:43,962
Good luck, old friend.

195
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,586
And to you.

196
00:13:26,532 --> 00:13:28,834
The Bajorans believe
it's good luck

197
00:13:28,871 --> 00:13:31,343
for a bride to wear
a Navatan shawl.

198
00:13:32,781 --> 00:13:34,250
What's the matter?

199
00:13:34,286 --> 00:13:36,086
You don't like it.

200
00:13:39,867 --> 00:13:41,633
It's lovely.

201
00:13:41,672 --> 00:13:43,404
Then why the long face?

202
00:13:45,815 --> 00:13:47,615
We need to talk.

203
00:13:49,425 --> 00:13:52,524
Why do I have a feeling
I'm not going to like this?

204
00:13:54,873 --> 00:13:57,243
There's something
I haven't told you.

205
00:14:01,656 --> 00:14:03,354
A few days ago

206
00:14:03,394 --> 00:14:06,425
one of the Prophets
came to me in a vision.

207
00:14:06,469 --> 00:14:08,805
It was Sarah.

208
00:14:08,842 --> 00:14:10,676
Your mother?

209
00:14:10,713 --> 00:14:13,311
What did she want?

210
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:19,363
She said the path
that I was meant to walk...

211
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:23,975
is for me alone.

212
00:14:25,852 --> 00:14:28,883
That you can't
walk it with me.

213
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,995
Why?

214
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,476
She said I would
know nothing but sorrow

215
00:14:35,511 --> 00:14:37,573
if I ignored her warning.

216
00:14:37,683 --> 00:14:40,885
Well, that almost
sounds like a threat.

217
00:14:40,925 --> 00:14:42,258
No.

218
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:45,360
It wasn't anything like that.

219
00:14:46,706 --> 00:14:48,974
She was worried for me.

220
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,281
Like a mother would be.

221
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,574
What are you going to do?

222
00:15:03,684 --> 00:15:05,153
Kasidy, the Prophets

223
00:15:05,188 --> 00:15:07,022
see things that we can't.

224
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,586
If she was that concerned

225
00:15:08,697 --> 00:15:10,634
it must be for a good reason.

226
00:15:12,373 --> 00:15:14,572
You're not answering
my question.

227
00:15:14,612 --> 00:15:15,911
Kasidy...

228
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,946
I love you...

229
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,625
and I want to be with you.

230
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:25,299
Then be with me, Ben.

231
00:15:29,685 --> 00:15:31,280
I can't.

232
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,699
I can't go against the Prophets.

233
00:15:49,603 --> 00:15:51,335
Kasidy, please.

234
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,369
Try and understand.

235
00:16:29,641 --> 00:16:30,871
No!

236
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:35,578
No!

237
00:16:35,622 --> 00:16:37,752
Ezri!

238
00:16:37,862 --> 00:16:39,229
No!

239
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:40,997
It is all right.

240
00:16:41,037 --> 00:16:42,940
You were having
a bad dream.

241
00:16:42,975 --> 00:16:44,444
Where are we?

242
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:46,507
We're still aboard
the Breen ship.

243
00:16:46,551 --> 00:16:49,957
They were chasing me...

244
00:16:49,993 --> 00:16:51,691
in an ice cave.

245
00:16:51,731 --> 00:16:53,497
It was so cold,
I could barely breathe.

246
00:16:53,536 --> 00:16:56,065
Shh! It is over now.

247
00:16:58,282 --> 00:17:00,516
I couldn't
get away from them.

248
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:02,753
Every time I looked back,
they were right behind me

249
00:17:02,793 --> 00:17:07,100
and then one of them
grabbed me with this huge claw.

250
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:10,408
The Breen do
not have claws.

251
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,941
How do you know?

252
00:17:12,986 --> 00:17:15,288
Besides, it-it was a dream.

253
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,297
Dreams are full of things
that don't make sense.

254
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:20,031
That is why
it is best to ignore them.

255
00:17:20,071 --> 00:17:21,563
How can you say that?

256
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:23,512
Dreams contain
valuable insights.

257
00:17:23,547 --> 00:17:25,279
Things that don't seem
to make any sense

258
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:27,312
are actually the key
to what your unconscious

259
00:17:27,357 --> 00:17:28,792
is trying to tell you.

260
00:17:28,827 --> 00:17:30,262
Anyway, I got away from him...

261
00:17:32,003 --> 00:17:33,837
but then,
there was nowhere to run

262
00:17:33,874 --> 00:17:37,509
and then, just when I thought
he was about to kill me

263
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:41,994
he reached up
and took off his helmet...

264
00:17:43,164 --> 00:17:44,133
And?

265
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:46,969
And...

266
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,705
it was Julian.

267
00:17:50,283 --> 00:17:51,878
Dr. Bashir.

268
00:17:53,358 --> 00:17:55,830
Isn't that strange?

269
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:57,802
I wonder what it meant?

270
00:17:57,836 --> 00:18:00,035
Dr. Bashir is a Breen.

271
00:18:00,075 --> 00:18:02,046
Very funny.

272
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:06,046
Now, the cave could
symbolize the womb.

273
00:18:06,091 --> 00:18:08,757
Maybe my subconscious
is trying to tell me

274
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,825
that I need
to confront emotions

275
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,864
that I've repressed
since birth.

276
00:18:12,975 --> 00:18:14,137
But which one?

277
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:16,342
I've been born nine times.

278
00:18:16,384 --> 00:18:19,084
This is ridiculous.

279
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,755
I'm a Counselor.

280
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:22,789
Analyzing dreams
is part of my job.

281
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:25,636
Jadzia never talked
about her dreams.

282
00:18:25,675 --> 00:18:27,737
Well, I'm not Jadzia, am I?

283
00:18:35,267 --> 00:18:36,759
Worf!

284
00:18:41,683 --> 00:18:43,483
Where are you taking him?

285
00:18:54,098 --> 00:18:57,231
...have mercy upon
your humble supplicant

286
00:18:57,273 --> 00:19:00,509
and make me worthy
of your great task.

287
00:19:00,548 --> 00:19:03,647
Grant me the strength
not to fail you.

288
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:15,616
Eminence?

289
00:19:15,653 --> 00:19:16,622
Yes?

290
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:17,920
There is a man here

291
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,262
who requests an
audience with you.

292
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:21,632
Show him in.

293
00:19:26,214 --> 00:19:28,914
This is Anjohl Tennan

294
00:19:28,954 --> 00:19:31,188
from Relliketh.

295
00:19:31,227 --> 00:19:33,095
Welcome, my son.

296
00:19:33,132 --> 00:19:35,934
Thank you for
seeing me, Eminence.

297
00:19:35,973 --> 00:19:38,103
How can I help you?

298
00:19:38,145 --> 00:19:40,173
I've come to ask your blessing

299
00:19:40,217 --> 00:19:45,253
so that I may have prosperity
in the coming season.

300
00:19:45,297 --> 00:19:47,359
What is it you do?

301
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:52,178
Oh, I'm just a simple man
of the land.

302
00:19:55,457 --> 00:19:56,687
Of the land?

303
00:19:56,727 --> 00:19:58,926
I'm a farmer.

304
00:19:58,966 --> 00:20:00,596
I grow <i>moba</i> and...

305
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,254
Your <i>pagh</i> is strong, Anjohl.

306
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:13,568
I've been waiting for you.

307
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:26,502
Oh, here, let me help you.

308
00:20:26,604 --> 00:20:28,268
It's not right that a Ranjen

309
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:30,405
should be serving
a common farmer.

310
00:20:30,448 --> 00:20:31,417
Please sit.

311
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,817
You're our guest.

312
00:20:41,008 --> 00:20:45,509
If I told my neighbors
I was having tea with the Kai

313
00:20:45,554 --> 00:20:48,152
they'd never believe me.

314
00:20:49,497 --> 00:20:51,127
Thank you, Solbor.

315
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:52,603
Thank you.

316
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,239
Tell me about
yourself, Anjohl.

317
00:20:57,283 --> 00:21:00,314
You came here to
pray for prosperity.

318
00:21:00,358 --> 00:21:03,764
Have things been
difficult for you?

319
00:21:03,801 --> 00:21:05,431
Yes.

320
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:10,007
Rogath blight destroyed
my entire crop last year.

321
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,249
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

322
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:13,258
Most of the farms

323
00:21:13,292 --> 00:21:15,764
in Relliketh
fell victim to it.

324
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:19,902
"And the land shall be
poisoned by a great evil."

325
00:21:23,051 --> 00:21:26,116
It's from the Ancient Texts...
Talnot's Prophesy

326
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,355
of the Final Days.

327
00:21:27,396 --> 00:21:28,592
I see.

328
00:21:28,632 --> 00:21:30,934
Well...

329
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:33,239
tell me more about this blight.

330
00:21:34,982 --> 00:21:38,286
Unfortunately,
the only way to eradicate it

331
00:21:38,324 --> 00:21:41,264
is to burn your fields
at the first sign

332
00:21:41,298 --> 00:21:42,824
of contamination.

333
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:44,133
Go on.

334
00:21:44,172 --> 00:21:47,510
Then you must let
your land lie fallow

335
00:21:47,548 --> 00:21:50,613
for a whole season
to allow

336
00:21:50,656 --> 00:21:52,855
for the restoration
of the soil.

337
00:21:54,766 --> 00:21:56,862
Restoration...

338
00:21:56,906 --> 00:21:58,536
The following year

339
00:21:58,576 --> 00:22:01,310
the fields will be
fertile again.

340
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,494
"The poison must be purged away
so the land can be reborn."

341
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,022
Eminence?

342
00:22:08,068 --> 00:22:10,802
Do you pray to the
Prophets, Anjohl?

343
00:22:10,841 --> 00:22:12,812
Oh, every day.

344
00:22:12,846 --> 00:22:15,182
And have they
ever answered you?

345
00:22:15,219 --> 00:22:18,489
In a vision or
in your dreams?

346
00:22:18,528 --> 00:22:20,522
Oh, there have been times

347
00:22:20,566 --> 00:22:25,010
when I thought
I could feel their presence.

348
00:22:26,014 --> 00:22:28,920
But spoken to me? No.

349
00:22:28,955 --> 00:22:31,655
Surely, they'd reserve
such a blessing

350
00:22:31,695 --> 00:22:33,255
for someone like you.

351
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,540
Well, you are right.

352
00:22:36,575 --> 00:22:38,705
They have spoken to me

353
00:22:38,748 --> 00:22:41,984
and they told me they were going
to send you here.

354
00:22:44,261 --> 00:22:45,730
Me?

355
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:46,732
You've been

356
00:22:46,801 --> 00:22:48,704
blessed, Anjohl.

357
00:22:48,739 --> 00:22:51,838
They've anointed you
to be my Guide.

358
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:58,361
I don't understand.

359
00:22:58,398 --> 00:23:01,804
You are going to help me
bring about the Restoration

360
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,207
of Bajor.

361
00:23:03,244 --> 00:23:05,808
But surely the Prophets
would have chosen

362
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:08,380
someone more worthy than I.

363
00:23:08,424 --> 00:23:11,957
You must have more faith
in yourself, Anjohl

364
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,130
and in the Prophets.

365
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,275
Of course.

366
00:23:18,317 --> 00:23:20,481
And rest assured,
they'll reveal

367
00:23:20,522 --> 00:23:23,051
what they want from us

368
00:23:23,095 --> 00:23:26,867
and together, we will walk
the path they've laid out.

369
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:31,211
Ah, the bottom line is

370
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,549
the Chief won't be able
to get to it

371
00:23:32,587 --> 00:23:33,556
for a few days.

372
00:23:33,589 --> 00:23:34,558
Not good enough.

373
00:23:34,592 --> 00:23:36,358
I told General Martok

374
00:23:36,397 --> 00:23:38,300
his ships would be repaired
by tomorrow.

375
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:40,807
We have engineering crews
working 26 hours a day.

376
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:43,974
We're doing the best we can.

377
00:23:44,017 --> 00:23:45,281
I-I know you are.

378
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:49,556
It's just that things are...

379
00:23:49,598 --> 00:23:52,504
a little complicated for me now.

380
00:23:52,538 --> 00:23:54,634
I can imagine.

381
00:23:56,181 --> 00:23:57,650
Nerys...

382
00:24:00,827 --> 00:24:03,595
the Prophets came to me...

383
00:24:03,634 --> 00:24:06,106
and told me that...

384
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,339
Kasidy and I...

385
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:12,015
are not meant
to walk the same path.

386
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,263
Ah.

387
00:24:15,298 --> 00:24:17,064
I see.

388
00:24:17,103 --> 00:24:19,735
Well, that explains that.

389
00:24:19,776 --> 00:24:21,006
I'm sorry

390
00:24:21,046 --> 00:24:22,949
but the Prophets
wouldn't ask you

391
00:24:22,984 --> 00:24:24,419
to do something like that

392
00:24:24,454 --> 00:24:25,480
without a reason.

393
00:24:25,524 --> 00:24:27,586
You would think
they would tell me what it is.

394
00:24:27,629 --> 00:24:30,728
It doesn't work like that,
and you know that.

395
00:24:34,147 --> 00:24:37,178
Well, what they're asking
you to do isn't easy

396
00:24:37,221 --> 00:24:38,885
but they've never led you

397
00:24:38,926 --> 00:24:40,122
down the wrong path.

398
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:41,894
Not so far.

399
00:24:41,933 --> 00:24:44,771
There's always a first time.

400
00:24:46,011 --> 00:24:48,415
To them, I'm "the Sisko"

401
00:24:48,451 --> 00:24:50,821
an instrument
to carry out their wishes

402
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:53,352
but they forget
that I am also human

403
00:24:53,397 --> 00:24:55,459
with dreams and wishes
of my own.

404
00:24:55,502 --> 00:24:58,236
They say that marrying
Kasidy is a mistake.

405
00:24:58,275 --> 00:25:01,408
Maybe it is,
but it's my mistake to make.

406
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:04,184
I wouldn't go
against the Prophets.

407
00:25:04,225 --> 00:25:06,321
You're doing
the right thing.

408
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:27,813
Founder.

409
00:25:29,123 --> 00:25:31,322
When do we reach
the rendezvous coordinates?

410
00:25:31,361 --> 00:25:33,229
Approximately
36 hours.

411
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:36,104
May I say
your plan is brilliant?

412
00:25:36,141 --> 00:25:38,705
I'm confident that it will
turn the war in our favor.

413
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:40,718
Let's hope
that you're right.

414
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,386
Founder?

415
00:25:43,427 --> 00:25:47,564
About Damar... I trust
he won't be a problem.

416
00:25:47,604 --> 00:25:49,005
I'm sure he'll
have his concerns

417
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:50,533
but you needn't
worry about that.

418
00:25:50,578 --> 00:25:52,446
I'll deal with him
when the time comes.

419
00:25:52,483 --> 00:25:53,816
See that you do.

420
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:56,451
I find him most trying.

421
00:25:56,493 --> 00:25:57,860
I'll have
the temperature lowered.

422
00:25:57,898 --> 00:25:59,458
You'll be more comfortable.

423
00:26:09,327 --> 00:26:10,626
Fight them!

424
00:26:10,664 --> 00:26:11,792
<i>Sto-Vo-Kor!</i>

425
00:26:12,802 --> 00:26:14,432
Worf!

426
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:15,965
No! No!

427
00:26:16,011 --> 00:26:17,914
I will not dishonor
her memory!

428
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:21,619
What have they done to you?

429
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:23,527
Alexander!

430
00:26:24,934 --> 00:26:27,806
Worf... wake up, please.

431
00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:31,675
Ezri...

432
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,710
Where did they take you?

433
00:26:45,053 --> 00:26:47,081
An interrogation chamber.

434
00:26:51,636 --> 00:26:53,105
They used some sort of...

435
00:26:53,141 --> 00:26:55,979
cortical implant
to probe my memory.

436
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,985
I wonder what they were
trying to find out.

437
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,319
I do not know.

438
00:26:59,357 --> 00:27:02,057
I lost consciousness.

439
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,432
That's probably a good thing.

440
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:07,501
I should have tried harder
to resist them.

441
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:10,373
Careful.

442
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:13,484
These Breen are without honor.

443
00:27:13,526 --> 00:27:15,086
Worf, sit down please.

444
00:27:15,131 --> 00:27:16,100
Have something to eat.

445
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,764
This is intolerable!

446
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:19,604
They have us caged
up like animals.

447
00:27:19,642 --> 00:27:20,838
Stop it.

448
00:27:20,879 --> 00:27:23,317
A Klingon would rather
die than be held captive.

449
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:24,321
What are you going to do?

450
00:27:24,355 --> 00:27:25,824
Kill yourself
and leave me here alone?

451
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:27,055
This is no time
for your jokes!

452
00:27:27,095 --> 00:27:30,069
It's no time for Klingon
chest-thumping either.

453
00:27:36,353 --> 00:27:37,515
Stop it!

454
00:27:50,511 --> 00:27:51,912
More spring wine?

455
00:27:51,948 --> 00:27:53,247
Yes.

456
00:27:53,318 --> 00:27:54,378
It's extraordinary.

457
00:27:54,421 --> 00:27:56,517
I've never tasted
anything like this.

458
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,263
Well, it's a rare vintage
from before the occupation.

459
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,433
I was going to
give this bottle

460
00:28:02,476 --> 00:28:04,846
to the Emissary
as a wedding gift.

461
00:28:04,882 --> 00:28:06,408
Well, I'm honored

462
00:28:06,452 --> 00:28:09,220
that you would choose
to share it with me.

463
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:12,027
Well, I doubt that he
would have been able

464
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:15,132
to appreciate it as much,
not being a Bajoran.

465
00:28:16,144 --> 00:28:17,704
I suppose not.

466
00:28:19,085 --> 00:28:23,996
The Prophets may have chosen
to speak through him, but...

467
00:28:25,401 --> 00:28:29,002
he's not really one of us,
is he?

468
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:34,113
No. No, he isn't.

469
00:28:39,472 --> 00:28:42,640
There are times...

470
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,144
when I wonder if he truly
understands our people.

471
00:28:47,493 --> 00:28:49,965
Still, it's not
for me to question

472
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:54,500
why the Prophets chose
him as their Emissary.

473
00:28:54,544 --> 00:28:58,350
You forget the Prophets
chose you as my Guide.

474
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,915
You must speak
your mind freely, Anjohl.

475
00:29:03,133 --> 00:29:07,075
The Emissary didn't suffer
through the occupation.

476
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:10,847
He has no idea what the
Cardassians did to us.

477
00:29:10,886 --> 00:29:16,196
Those years left many scars
on Bajor's soul.

478
00:29:16,233 --> 00:29:21,201
So... how can he help heal...

479
00:29:21,246 --> 00:29:24,048
what he could never comprehend?

480
00:29:24,087 --> 00:29:27,995
I have often asked myself
the same question.

481
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:32,374
I survived the occupation
purely by chance.

482
00:29:32,475 --> 00:29:34,207
Tell me.

483
00:29:34,247 --> 00:29:37,119
When the resistance destroyed

484
00:29:37,154 --> 00:29:40,219
the Cardassian outpost
in Relliketh

485
00:29:40,263 --> 00:29:43,294
Gul Dukat ordered 100 Bajorans

486
00:29:43,337 --> 00:29:44,772
rounded up.

487
00:29:44,807 --> 00:29:48,111
His intention was to
send us to the capital

488
00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:50,211
for public execution.

489
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:52,989
100 from Relliketh?

490
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:54,328
Mm.

491
00:29:54,365 --> 00:29:56,165
When did that occur?

492
00:29:56,203 --> 00:29:59,975
Just before the Great Famine.

493
00:30:00,013 --> 00:30:02,007
By sheer luck

494
00:30:02,053 --> 00:30:05,255
my transport was rerouted
to a labor camp

495
00:30:05,294 --> 00:30:08,598
and I learned years later

496
00:30:08,636 --> 00:30:11,701
that the dispatcher
had misread the orders.

497
00:30:14,284 --> 00:30:16,221
Well, his name was Prenar

498
00:30:16,255 --> 00:30:18,021
and he didn't

499
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,894
misread the orders.

500
00:30:23,408 --> 00:30:25,538
How could you know that?

501
00:30:28,654 --> 00:30:31,685
I was a Ranjen at that time.

502
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:34,293
I convinced the Vedek
who led my Order

503
00:30:34,336 --> 00:30:38,746
that we needed to take a more
active role in the resistance.

504
00:30:38,781 --> 00:30:41,755
He allowed me to remove
some gemstones

505
00:30:41,789 --> 00:30:43,555
from our tabernacle.

506
00:30:43,627 --> 00:30:46,293
I used those
to bribe various

507
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:51,712
Cardassians in exchange
for some small acts of leniency.

508
00:30:51,748 --> 00:30:54,745
Prenar was one of them.

509
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,364
I paid him to reroute
the transport from Relliketh.

510
00:31:08,592 --> 00:31:11,532
You saved my life.

511
00:31:13,203 --> 00:31:15,402
Even then...

512
00:31:15,443 --> 00:31:17,711
our fates were linked.

513
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:38,735
Yes.

514
00:31:42,814 --> 00:31:45,582
Uh, sorry to interrupt,
but I have something for you.

515
00:31:45,621 --> 00:31:46,988
The, uh...

516
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:52,399
the item that you ordered.

517
00:32:00,092 --> 00:32:02,724
Terellian diamonds aren't
that easy to come by

518
00:32:02,766 --> 00:32:04,167
especially with this war on.

519
00:32:04,203 --> 00:32:07,838
Needless to say,
it was non-refundable.

520
00:32:09,349 --> 00:32:11,047
Thank you, Quark.

521
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:18,666
Um...

522
00:32:18,707 --> 00:32:21,579
seems a shame to let
something so beautiful

523
00:32:21,615 --> 00:32:23,107
go to waste.

524
00:32:54,433 --> 00:32:57,031
I'm going to help you
through this, Garak.

525
00:33:08,402 --> 00:33:11,672
I'm not just saying this
because I'm your sister.

526
00:33:11,711 --> 00:33:13,910
You have a gift.

527
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,361
No more algae paste.

528
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:29,120
I'm not like you.

529
00:33:29,157 --> 00:33:30,683
I'm not like you, Joran.

530
00:33:30,727 --> 00:33:31,957
I'm not a murderer.

531
00:33:31,997 --> 00:33:35,301
Shh.

532
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:36,672
It's all right.

533
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:42,748
I was your wife.

534
00:33:42,791 --> 00:33:45,229
Why don't you talk to me?

535
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:51,771
I love you.

536
00:33:56,093 --> 00:33:58,622
Kiss me.

537
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:01,299
Kiss me, Julian.

538
00:34:31,218 --> 00:34:32,414
Yes?

539
00:34:32,454 --> 00:34:34,049
Forgive me for disturbing you

540
00:34:34,091 --> 00:34:35,755
at this hour, Eminence

541
00:34:35,796 --> 00:34:39,329
but Anjohl is here,
and he insists on seeing you.

542
00:34:39,372 --> 00:34:40,898
I'll be right there.

543
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:53,832
Eminence

544
00:34:53,876 --> 00:34:55,642
I hope I didn't
wake you.

545
00:34:55,681 --> 00:34:57,207
That's all right.

546
00:34:59,123 --> 00:35:00,335
You may go, Solbor.

547
00:35:01,906 --> 00:35:03,570
As you wish.

548
00:35:11,731 --> 00:35:13,565
Something wondrous

549
00:35:13,669 --> 00:35:15,503
has happened.

550
00:35:15,541 --> 00:35:17,444
I talked to my brother
in Relliketh.

551
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,110
He told me that
this morning

552
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,679
when he went out to
inspect the fields

553
00:35:21,723 --> 00:35:25,392
he found <i>moba</i> saplings
sprouting from the soil.

554
00:35:25,433 --> 00:35:27,165
But it's impossible.

555
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:29,404
We only planted last week.

556
00:35:29,444 --> 00:35:31,608
Tell me...

557
00:35:31,683 --> 00:35:34,087
could it be a sign?

558
00:35:35,426 --> 00:35:38,628
Yes, it is a sign...

559
00:35:38,701 --> 00:35:41,173
a sign from the Prophets.

560
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:43,509
They're telling you
that your farm

561
00:35:43,547 --> 00:35:46,349
will thrive
under your brother's care.

562
00:35:46,388 --> 00:35:49,054
They don't want you
to go back to Relliketh.

563
00:35:49,095 --> 00:35:52,399
They want you at my side.

564
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:57,645
Then this is where
I'll stay, Eminence.

565
00:35:59,522 --> 00:36:01,082
Adami.

566
00:36:03,432 --> 00:36:04,833
Adami.

567
00:36:07,409 --> 00:36:09,779
What a beautiful name.

568
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,356
It's all right.

569
00:36:17,201 --> 00:36:19,297
The Prophets brought
us together.

570
00:36:31,605 --> 00:36:32,801
That's the last of it.

571
00:36:32,842 --> 00:36:35,041
Tell Kilby to start the
final departure check.

572
00:36:35,081 --> 00:36:36,072
Yes, ma'am.

573
00:36:45,073 --> 00:36:46,508
I made a mistake.

574
00:36:46,544 --> 00:36:48,208
I don't care what
the Prophets want.

575
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:49,947
I want to marry you.

576
00:36:49,986 --> 00:36:51,616
We'll worry
about the rest later.

577
00:36:52,827 --> 00:36:55,129
Ben, don't do this to me...

578
00:36:55,167 --> 00:36:57,901
not if you're going
to change your mind again.

579
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,170
I won't.

580
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,805
I love you.

581
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:06,719
Okay, let's go.

582
00:37:06,796 --> 00:37:07,856
Where?

583
00:37:07,899 --> 00:37:09,300
Where do you think?

584
00:37:21,735 --> 00:37:23,102
Didn't think
you were going to make it.

585
00:37:23,139 --> 00:37:24,973
I only heard about
it 20 minutes ago.

586
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,947
Me, too, and I'm the caterer.

587
00:37:27,985 --> 00:37:29,420
Thank you, Quark.

588
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,323
I can't work
under these conditions.

589
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,024
Too bad Ezri and Worf
couldn't be here.

590
00:37:33,064 --> 00:37:35,559
Well, they probably
got held up

591
00:37:35,604 --> 00:37:37,336
picking out a wedding gift.

592
00:37:43,157 --> 00:37:45,025
Something for you, Nog?

593
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:48,093
Usually when we come
to events like this

594
00:37:48,137 --> 00:37:50,108
you're the one who
has to remind me

595
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,874
to smile.

596
00:37:54,486 --> 00:37:58,691
I wonder why they decided
not to have a Bajoran ceremony.

597
00:38:00,168 --> 00:38:02,538
I hope the Prophets
forgive them.

598
00:38:02,574 --> 00:38:04,272
So do I.

599
00:38:12,634 --> 00:38:14,103
You look beautiful.

600
00:38:14,138 --> 00:38:15,733
Thank you.

601
00:38:19,551 --> 00:38:21,681
Well done, Nog.

602
00:38:21,724 --> 00:38:24,492
Considering I only had
a few minutes to practice.

603
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,026
One of the most pleasant duties
of a senior officer

604
00:38:36,062 --> 00:38:39,264
is the privilege of joining
two people together

605
00:38:39,303 --> 00:38:40,738
in matrimony.

606
00:38:40,773 --> 00:38:44,910
Today, I have the honor
to unite Kasidy Danielle Yates

607
00:38:45,018 --> 00:38:48,516
and Benjamin Lafayette Sisko
in marriage.

608
00:38:48,561 --> 00:38:51,763
Kasidy, do you accept this man
as your husband

609
00:38:51,802 --> 00:38:54,536
to love and cherish
above all others

610
00:38:54,576 --> 00:38:56,444
until death separates you?

611
00:38:56,481 --> 00:38:58,611
I do.

612
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:03,592
Benjamin, do you accept
this woman as your wife

613
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,501
to love and cherish her

614
00:39:05,538 --> 00:39:08,637
above all others
until death separates you?

615
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:12,313
I do.

616
00:39:12,356 --> 00:39:14,590
These rings

617
00:39:14,628 --> 00:39:17,466
are a symbol of your love
for each other

618
00:39:17,502 --> 00:39:20,340
and a promise to abide
by the vows

619
00:39:20,377 --> 00:39:21,846
you've made today.

620
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:31,464
With this ring, I thee wed.

621
00:39:35,181 --> 00:39:36,776
With this ring...

622
00:39:38,056 --> 00:39:41,121
This is not meant
to be, Benjamin.

623
00:39:41,164 --> 00:39:42,759
I've made my decision.

624
00:39:42,801 --> 00:39:45,330
Your trial is at hand.

625
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:47,243
You must be strong.

626
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,376
Kasidy gives me strength.

627
00:39:49,418 --> 00:39:51,514
Why can't you understand that?

628
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:53,255
If you do this

629
00:39:53,295 --> 00:39:56,029
you will know only sorrow.

630
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:59,373
You shared
my mother's existence.

631
00:39:59,411 --> 00:40:03,319
You must have some
idea what love is.

632
00:40:03,354 --> 00:40:06,294
You should know that
I will never be happy

633
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:07,798
without Kasidy.

634
00:40:07,832 --> 00:40:10,498
Your path is a difficult one.

635
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,821
I cannot change...

636
00:40:18,861 --> 00:40:20,559
what is to come.

637
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,400
I know.

638
00:40:26,949 --> 00:40:28,886
Be careful...

639
00:40:30,024 --> 00:40:31,858
my son.

640
00:40:36,072 --> 00:40:37,302
Ben?

641
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,416
With this ring...

642
00:40:47,101 --> 00:40:49,163
I thee wed.

643
00:40:52,549 --> 00:40:54,611
By the power vested in me

644
00:40:54,654 --> 00:40:56,990
by the United Federation
of Planets...

645
00:40:57,027 --> 00:41:00,126
I pronounce you
husband and wife.

646
00:41:15,832 --> 00:41:16,960
I need to talk to you.

647
00:41:18,072 --> 00:41:19,667
Oh?

648
00:41:19,742 --> 00:41:22,682
I demand to know
where we are going.

649
00:41:26,226 --> 00:41:27,856
Of course.

650
00:41:27,897 --> 00:41:29,093
In fact, I was just coming

651
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:31,263
to your quarters
to discuss the matter.

652
00:41:31,306 --> 00:41:32,707
Were you?

653
00:41:32,743 --> 00:41:35,615
I've kept you in the dark
for too long, Damar

654
00:41:35,651 --> 00:41:37,987
and for that, I apologize.

655
00:41:38,023 --> 00:41:41,225
You are the leader of Cardassia

656
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:43,897
and you deserve to know
everything we're doing

657
00:41:43,939 --> 00:41:47,904
and I have a feeling

658
00:41:47,949 --> 00:41:50,011
you're going to be very pleased.

659
00:41:58,276 --> 00:42:00,179
Would you stop that?

660
00:42:03,556 --> 00:42:05,048
What's wrong?

661
00:42:05,094 --> 00:42:07,258
You haven't said
a word to me in hours.

662
00:42:09,739 --> 00:42:12,473
I should not have trusted you
with my heart.

663
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,016
What is that supposed to mean?

664
00:42:16,055 --> 00:42:18,789
You dishonor me and yourself.

665
00:42:20,801 --> 00:42:23,501
I must have missed something
when I was gone.

666
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,637
How long have you had
these feelings for him?

667
00:42:25,681 --> 00:42:26,877
For who?

668
00:42:26,917 --> 00:42:28,181
Dr. Bashir.

669
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,918
- What?
- When the Breen

670
00:42:29,957 --> 00:42:32,191
brought you back,
you spoke his name.

671
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,756
I did?

672
00:42:33,802 --> 00:42:36,036
Yes. You said
that you loved him.

673
00:42:37,243 --> 00:42:38,678
Julian?

674
00:42:38,714 --> 00:42:40,548
I said that I loved Julian?

675
00:42:40,585 --> 00:42:42,351
Do not try to deny it.

676
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:44,418
Oh, Worf.

677
00:42:47,036 --> 00:42:51,845
Look, I admit that I find him
to be... charming...

678
00:42:51,881 --> 00:42:55,653
and obviously, he is an
attractive man, but I'm not...

679
00:42:55,692 --> 00:42:57,663
You are in love with him!

680
00:42:57,697 --> 00:42:58,666
I am not!

681
00:42:58,699 --> 00:42:59,963
Then why do you
dream about him?

682
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,802
You're the one that said
that dreams don't mean anything.

683
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,372
I should've known.

684
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:07,251
Jadzia had feelings for him
as well.

685
00:43:07,288 --> 00:43:09,954
Would you
stop comparing me to her!

686
00:43:22,427 --> 00:43:23,691
We meet at last.

687
00:43:26,605 --> 00:43:27,665
Gifts?

688
00:43:30,114 --> 00:43:32,278
How thoughtful.

689
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,815
You should be honored.

690
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:37,993
You're witnessing
an historic moment...

691
00:43:38,034 --> 00:43:39,594
the birth of the alliance

692
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:43,308
between the Dominion
and the Breen.

693
00:43:44,585 --> 00:43:46,556
Changes everything, doesn't it?
