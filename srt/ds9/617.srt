1
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:10,386
The <i>Saratoga</i> put in
this morning.

2
00:00:10,425 --> 00:00:11,952
We are not having another party.

3
00:00:11,996 --> 00:00:14,094
I promise, not more
than 50 or 60...

4
00:00:14,137 --> 00:00:15,505
I can see it now.

5
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:19,007
200 people jammed
into our quarters... eating

6
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:21,025
drinking, laughing.

7
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:23,157
Sounds awful.

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,003
What if I promise
absolutely no laughing?

9
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,443
No, I mean it.

10
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:29,918
You won't see a single
smile the entire evening.

11
00:00:29,954 --> 00:00:32,450
It'll be the grimmest party
you've ever been to.

12
00:00:34,937 --> 00:00:36,806
When do you want
to have this party?

13
00:00:36,843 --> 00:00:37,869
Next week.

14
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:38,881
And I was thinking

15
00:00:38,915 --> 00:00:41,856
maybe this evening
should have... a theme.

16
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:43,591
What kind of theme?

17
00:00:43,631 --> 00:00:46,664
What if everyone came as
their favorite Klingon?

18
00:00:47,711 --> 00:00:49,410
Bad idea.

19
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,685
Commander,
your holosuite is ready.

20
00:00:53,195 --> 00:00:54,221
Good.

21
00:00:54,265 --> 00:00:56,738
Have fun exercising.

22
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:00,279
No party?

23
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,379
I came this close.

24
00:01:05,434 --> 00:01:06,836
Thank you, Quark.

25
00:01:06,872 --> 00:01:08,069
Don't mention it, Major.

26
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,237
Glad to be of help.

27
00:01:09,313 --> 00:01:11,377
Bajoran lilacs.

28
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,263
Is there something going on
between the two of you

29
00:01:15,298 --> 00:01:16,267
that I don't know about?

30
00:01:16,301 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh, don't be disgusting.

31
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:22,278
I ordered them for myself.

32
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:23,791
Well, that's nice.

33
00:01:23,826 --> 00:01:25,593
I thought you
didn't like flowers.

34
00:01:25,632 --> 00:01:26,795
I don't.

35
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,432
I'm confused.

36
00:01:28,474 --> 00:01:30,309
Jadzia, there's
such a thing as privacy.

37
00:01:30,413 --> 00:01:31,507
Not between friends.

38
00:01:33,122 --> 00:01:34,923
It's my mother's birthday.

39
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:36,226
She would've been 60 today

40
00:01:36,265 --> 00:01:38,899
and my father always said
that these were her favorite.

41
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:41,039
That's a nice way
to remember your mother.

42
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:42,574
I wish I did remember her.

43
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:43,679
I was only three

44
00:01:43,723 --> 00:01:45,752
when she died
at the refugee center.

45
00:01:45,796 --> 00:01:48,464
Well, I bet
she'd be proud of you

46
00:01:48,504 --> 00:01:49,974
and what you've done
with your life.

47
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,848
Hmm. I'd like to think so.

48
00:01:52,885 --> 00:01:54,584
I've always been proud of her.

49
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,757
My father always said...

50
00:01:56,797 --> 00:02:00,103
she was the bravest woman
he ever met.

51
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:20,197
Major Kira, you have
an incoming transmission.

52
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,622
From whom?

53
00:02:25,657 --> 00:02:27,960
Unable to identify.

54
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,913
Oh...

55
00:02:36,492 --> 00:02:37,792
Put it through.

56
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:48,292
Ah, Major, there you are.

57
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:49,994
I'm sorry to wake you.

58
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:51,402
What the hell
do you want, Dukat?

59
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:52,999
Oh, don't bother, Major.

60
00:02:53,044 --> 00:02:56,749
I guarantee you won't be able
to trace this transmission.

61
00:02:56,789 --> 00:03:00,426
Well, then, why don't you
just tell me where you are?

62
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:02,872
Because that's not why I called.

63
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:07,721
I want to help you, Major,
the way Captain Sisko helped me.

64
00:03:07,757 --> 00:03:09,786
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

65
00:03:09,831 --> 00:03:14,175
Captain Sisko
gave me the clarity

66
00:03:14,211 --> 00:03:16,411
to see beyond the lies...

67
00:03:16,452 --> 00:03:20,522
the self-deceptions
that were controlling my life.

68
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:24,373
He helped me to see
the truth about myself

69
00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:29,519
and now, I'm going to do
the same for you.

70
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:35,135
And what better day to do it
than on your mother's birthday.

71
00:03:35,178 --> 00:03:37,242
Was that supposed to upset me?

72
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:39,919
That you know
it's my mother's birthday?

73
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:42,492
She was a striking woman,
your mother...

74
00:03:42,536 --> 00:03:44,600
although when we first met

75
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:48,086
she was very self-conscious
about that scar

76
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,822
along the side of her face.

77
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:55,001
She used to try to cover it up
with a strand of hair.

78
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:57,881
Nice try, Dukat...

79
00:03:57,917 --> 00:04:00,653
but you never knew my mother.

80
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:02,961
She died in the...

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,767
The Singha refugee center?

82
00:04:04,806 --> 00:04:07,372
I'm afraid not, Major.

83
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:10,151
That was something
your father told you

84
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,257
because he couldn't bear
to face the truth.

85
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,238
What truth?

86
00:04:18,584 --> 00:04:21,388
That your mother left him...

87
00:04:21,426 --> 00:04:23,398
to be with me.

88
00:04:25,171 --> 00:04:27,667
Oh, you're lying.

89
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,922
Your mother and I were lovers
almost from the moment we met.

90
00:04:32,963 --> 00:04:36,702
And we remained lovers
until the day she died.

91
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:39,078
I have had enough of this.

92
00:04:39,116 --> 00:04:42,616
I see you have lilacs
on your nightstand.

93
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,099
Your mother
would've been touched.

94
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:47,631
She loved Bajoran lilacs.

95
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:50,616
There.

96
00:04:51,823 --> 00:04:55,267
I told you the truth
was liberating, Major.

97
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:59,109
Now, don't you feel better?

98
00:04:59,147 --> 00:05:00,914
I do.

99
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:14,824
Computer, locate
Cardassian occupation files

100
00:07:14,865 --> 00:07:16,496
Singha refugee center.

101
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:22,145
Find and display Bajoran
identity profile: Kira Meru.

102
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,147
You're just going to have
to take my word for it.

103
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:42,275
The Battle of the Alamo

104
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,291
would make
a hell of a holosuite program.

105
00:07:44,325 --> 00:07:45,294
All right, all right.

106
00:07:45,328 --> 00:07:46,821
Let me get this straight
because I...

107
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:47,961
There are 200 of us

108
00:07:48,003 --> 00:07:50,944
trapped inside some crumbling
old mission or whatever

109
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,887
surrounded
by 2,000 enemy troops.

110
00:07:53,922 --> 00:07:54,891
Is that right?

111
00:07:54,926 --> 00:07:55,895
That's right.

112
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:56,955
Do we win?

113
00:07:56,999 --> 00:07:58,492
No, we lose.

114
00:07:58,537 --> 00:08:00,338
Why do you want
to play a program

115
00:08:00,377 --> 00:08:01,346
where we lose?

116
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,873
Well, you're missing the point.

117
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:03,944
There's nothing more noble

118
00:08:03,987 --> 00:08:06,460
than a heroic defeat,
especially against

119
00:08:06,496 --> 00:08:07,590
overwhelming odds.

120
00:08:07,632 --> 00:08:08,760
In life maybe

121
00:08:08,803 --> 00:08:10,171
but not in the holosuite.

122
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:13,548
Chief, you were supposed
to have finished recalibrating

123
00:08:13,586 --> 00:08:15,718
those induction modulators
yesterday.

124
00:08:15,758 --> 00:08:18,757
Yeah, we had a bit of a problem
replacing some of the coil...

125
00:08:18,802 --> 00:08:21,241
Save the excuses.
I want it done within the hour.

126
00:08:21,276 --> 00:08:23,340
Doctor, is there a reason
for your visit?

127
00:08:23,383 --> 00:08:24,283
What?

128
00:08:25,891 --> 00:08:28,228
Actually, Miles and I were...

129
00:08:28,266 --> 00:08:30,101
Thought not.

130
00:08:30,138 --> 00:08:31,574
We're on duty here
if you don't mind.

131
00:08:31,609 --> 00:08:34,744
I don't want to interfere.

132
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:51,705
Well, all right, everyone,
we're not at the Replimat.

133
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,267
We're not here
to drink <i>raktajinos</i>

134
00:08:53,312 --> 00:08:54,839
and catch up
on the latest gossip.

135
00:08:54,883 --> 00:08:56,752
Let's get to work.

136
00:09:10,701 --> 00:09:12,262
Odo, I've just been informed

137
00:09:12,305 --> 00:09:15,338
of the increased criminal
activity on the Promenade.

138
00:09:15,382 --> 00:09:18,016
It's not as bad
as it sounds, Major.

139
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,759
We're talking about
a few incidents of petty theft.

140
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,668
I've already assigned
two deputies.

141
00:09:22,705 --> 00:09:25,806
I'd prefer that you handle
the matter yourself.

142
00:09:28,357 --> 00:09:30,660
If you think it's necessary.

143
00:09:30,698 --> 00:09:32,100
I do.

144
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:35,169
And make sure that you keep me
informed of your progress.

145
00:09:35,213 --> 00:09:37,686
Of course.

146
00:09:40,864 --> 00:09:43,965
Is there something else
on your mind?

147
00:09:44,007 --> 00:09:45,534
Meaning what?

148
00:09:45,578 --> 00:09:49,181
Meaning I talked
with Dr. Bashir.

149
00:09:49,223 --> 00:09:51,218
He told me
that you seemed irritable.

150
00:09:51,264 --> 00:09:53,703
I see he's not exaggerating.

151
00:09:53,738 --> 00:09:56,873
Would you care to tell me
what's bothering you?

152
00:09:58,922 --> 00:10:01,293
I appreciate the offer, Odo

153
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:05,399
but I don't think talking
about it is going to help.

154
00:10:05,442 --> 00:10:07,038
Sounds serious.

155
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:09,019
It is.

156
00:10:11,596 --> 00:10:14,435
Well, if you won't talk about it

157
00:10:14,471 --> 00:10:18,040
perhaps you should consider
doing something about it.

158
00:10:27,445 --> 00:10:29,440
A transmission from Gul Dukat?

159
00:10:29,486 --> 00:10:31,082
This is the first
I've heard of it.

160
00:10:31,124 --> 00:10:32,925
That's because
I didn't report it.

161
00:10:32,963 --> 00:10:34,263
Why not?

162
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,861
It was of a personal nature.

163
00:10:35,906 --> 00:10:37,741
I tried to trace the signal,
but...

164
00:10:38,748 --> 00:10:40,447
What did he want?

165
00:10:42,561 --> 00:10:44,796
He said he knew my mother,
that they were lovers.

166
00:10:47,977 --> 00:10:49,972
You don't believe him, do you?

167
00:10:50,018 --> 00:10:52,184
He knew certain things
about her.

168
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:53,353
Personal things.

169
00:10:53,395 --> 00:10:55,766
Well, Gul Dukat is
a very resourceful man.

170
00:10:55,803 --> 00:10:57,969
I'm sure he knows
a lot about your family...

171
00:10:58,009 --> 00:10:59,343
about all of our families.

172
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,051
I keep trying to tell myself
that, but I need to know.

173
00:11:04,396 --> 00:11:06,391
That may not be possible, Major.

174
00:11:06,437 --> 00:11:07,998
There is a way.

175
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,446
I can visit
the temple of lponu on Bajor

176
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:12,250
and consult the Orb of Time.

177
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:13,452
Excuse me?

178
00:11:13,492 --> 00:11:15,293
I need to know the truth.

179
00:11:17,438 --> 00:11:19,536
Let me get this straight.

180
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:20,981
You want to travel
back in time

181
00:11:21,017 --> 00:11:23,286
to see if Gul Dukat
and your mother were lovers.

182
00:11:23,324 --> 00:11:24,989
That's right.

183
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,090
Major, the Federation

184
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,104
has very strict
regulations concern...

185
00:11:28,207 --> 00:11:30,680
This has nothing to do
with the Federation.

186
00:11:30,714 --> 00:11:31,842
I need your help

187
00:11:31,885 --> 00:11:34,553
as the Emissary,
not a Starfleet Captain.

188
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:36,692
The Emissary can see to it

189
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:38,534
that I am allowed access
to the Orb.

190
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,445
After that,
it's up to the Prophets.

191
00:11:41,482 --> 00:11:44,982
If they feel
that my request is worthy

192
00:11:45,027 --> 00:11:47,159
they'll send me
where I need to go.

193
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,107
If not, I've made a trip
to Bajor for nothing.

194
00:11:53,052 --> 00:11:55,548
And if they do send you back?

195
00:11:55,594 --> 00:11:57,190
What then?

196
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,896
What makes you so sure

197
00:11:58,938 --> 00:12:01,742
you won't interfere
with the timeline?

198
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,151
The Prophets will be guiding me.

199
00:12:04,221 --> 00:12:06,626
Nothing will happen
without their blessings.

200
00:12:06,662 --> 00:12:08,691
Please, Emissary.

201
00:12:08,736 --> 00:12:10,834
Please...

202
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,577
let me seek the will
of the Prophets.

203
00:13:09,263 --> 00:13:10,597
Thank you.

204
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,563
Meru, I found Nerys.

205
00:13:55,476 --> 00:13:56,878
Where was she?

206
00:13:56,914 --> 00:13:59,947
Wandering over there,
scrounging for food.

207
00:13:59,991 --> 00:14:02,591
Come here, sweetie,
beside me, here.

208
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,761
Is that all?

209
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:05,171
That's barely half a cup.

210
00:14:05,207 --> 00:14:06,233
They've cut everyone's rations.

211
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,372
It's not enough.

212
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:09,386
How do they expect us
to survive?

213
00:14:09,421 --> 00:14:11,519
The Cardassians don't care
whether or not we survive.

214
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:13,328
They won't be happy
until we're all dead.

215
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:14,393
Come here, sweetie, come here.

216
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:15,406
Have some soup.

217
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,933
Excuse me.

218
00:14:16,978 --> 00:14:19,714
That soup... it's ours.

219
00:14:19,754 --> 00:14:20,780
What are you talking about?

220
00:14:20,824 --> 00:14:22,260
My wife stood in line
all day to get it.

221
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:23,321
If you think you can just...

222
00:14:23,365 --> 00:14:25,269
Just... what?

223
00:14:25,304 --> 00:14:27,641
It's for the children.

224
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:29,480
They're hungry.

225
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,354
We are all hungry.

226
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:32,118
That's right, we are.

227
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:35,124
And hunger can make people
do stupid things.

228
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,791
Like what you're doing now.

229
00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:38,268
Cardassians are the enemy.

230
00:14:38,304 --> 00:14:40,709
We shouldn't be
fighting amongst ourselves.

231
00:14:40,744 --> 00:14:42,443
We should be trying
to help each other.

232
00:14:42,483 --> 00:14:43,452
That's what we were doing...

233
00:14:43,486 --> 00:14:45,013
helping ourselves to some soup.

234
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,025
Hey, you want soup

235
00:14:46,128 --> 00:14:48,363
you go stand in line
like everyone else.

236
00:14:48,402 --> 00:14:50,602
We may have to take orders
from the spoonheads

237
00:14:50,643 --> 00:14:53,174
but we don't have
to take them from you!

238
00:15:11,108 --> 00:15:13,377
Oh, thank you.

239
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,651
I wish we could repay
your kindness somehow,

240
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,058
but we have so little food.

241
00:15:17,127 --> 00:15:19,259
That's all right;
I'm not hungry.

242
00:15:19,301 --> 00:15:21,433
Can't remember the last time
I met a Bajoran

243
00:15:21,475 --> 00:15:23,379
who wasn't hungry.

244
00:15:23,414 --> 00:15:25,443
I'm Kira Meru.

245
00:15:25,488 --> 00:15:27,825
I'm...

246
00:15:27,862 --> 00:15:29,926
just glad I could help.

247
00:15:29,968 --> 00:15:31,599
And this is my husband

248
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,909
Taban, my son, Reon

249
00:15:33,948 --> 00:15:37,322
my son, Pohl,
and my daughter, Nerys.

250
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,538
They're beautiful.

251
00:15:43,578 --> 00:15:44,547
Mommy. Mommy.

252
00:15:44,582 --> 00:15:46,383
What is it, honey?

253
00:15:46,422 --> 00:15:47,550
What is it?

254
00:15:47,591 --> 00:15:48,560
What? Tell me.

255
00:15:51,906 --> 00:15:54,882
She wants to know
what your name is.

256
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:58,324
Me?

257
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:07,048
I'm Luma Rahl.

258
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:11,526
It's nice to meet you, Nerys.

259
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:14,942
Attention!

260
00:16:14,979 --> 00:16:17,545
The new Cardassian
Ore Processing Center

261
00:16:17,587 --> 00:16:19,456
orbiting Bajor is
nearing completion.

262
00:16:19,493 --> 00:16:21,397
The Cardassian troops
stationed there

263
00:16:21,432 --> 00:16:23,905
will require "comfort women"

264
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:27,749
to make their tour of duty
less... stressful.

265
00:16:28,756 --> 00:16:29,919
Her.

266
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,799
- No!
- No!

267
00:16:32,835 --> 00:16:35,172
From now on, you'll
receive extra rations

268
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,841
of food and medicine...

269
00:16:36,882 --> 00:16:39,482
courtesy of our Prefect,
Gul Dukat.

270
00:16:39,524 --> 00:16:40,515
Her.

271
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,894
No!

272
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:44,533
And her.

273
00:16:48,486 --> 00:16:50,013
But my children...

274
00:16:50,057 --> 00:16:53,501
Your children will eat better
than they have any right to.

275
00:16:53,535 --> 00:16:55,062
Meru!

276
00:16:55,107 --> 00:16:56,076
Mommy!

277
00:16:56,111 --> 00:16:57,411
I love you!

278
00:16:57,447 --> 00:16:59,682
Don't let them forget me!

279
00:17:04,637 --> 00:17:06,198
I said go!

280
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,452
You.

281
00:17:20,488 --> 00:17:22,153
And you.

282
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:42,684
Ladies, can I have
your attention, please?

283
00:17:42,726 --> 00:17:45,667
You will find food
in your quarters.

284
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:47,867
Eat as much as you want...

285
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:50,509
and make sure you get
a good night's rest.

286
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:53,253
You'll want
to look your best tomorrow.

287
00:17:53,293 --> 00:17:56,565
Oh, and feel free to linger
as long as you want

288
00:17:56,603 --> 00:17:58,096
in the sonic showers.

289
00:17:58,142 --> 00:18:02,315
Cardassians value cleanliness.

290
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,182
Meru, listen to me.

291
00:18:13,223 --> 00:18:15,754
I know things look bad

292
00:18:15,797 --> 00:18:17,131
but don't give up just yet.

293
00:18:17,168 --> 00:18:18,901
We'll find a way
to get out of here.

294
00:18:18,941 --> 00:18:20,172
How?

295
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:22,116
There must be a resistance cell

296
00:18:22,151 --> 00:18:23,382
operating here on the station.

297
00:18:23,422 --> 00:18:24,448
We'll contact them.

298
00:18:24,526 --> 00:18:25,757
They'll help us get away.

299
00:18:25,796 --> 00:18:28,235
I don't believe this.

300
00:18:32,518 --> 00:18:34,251
Fresh <i>moba.</i>

301
00:18:38,002 --> 00:18:41,605
Do you know how long it's been
since I've seen fresh <i>moba?</i>

302
00:18:41,647 --> 00:18:43,140
Nice.

303
00:18:43,186 --> 00:18:44,520
Nice?

304
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,890
Look at this.

305
00:18:45,928 --> 00:18:46,897
Katterpod beans and...

306
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:49,062
<i>hasperat...</i>

307
00:18:50,141 --> 00:18:51,737
<i>veklava...</i>

308
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:52,748
a pot of deka tea.

309
00:18:52,783 --> 00:18:54,915
We could live on this
for a year.

310
00:18:54,956 --> 00:18:56,552
Easy. Easy.

311
00:18:56,628 --> 00:18:58,395
You don't want
to make yourself sick.

312
00:18:58,434 --> 00:19:01,808
Sick?
From too much food?

313
00:19:01,845 --> 00:19:03,680
That would be a change.

314
00:19:05,891 --> 00:19:08,695
If only Taban and the children
were here.

315
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:23,907
The Cardassians said they
would take care of them

316
00:19:23,949 --> 00:19:26,149
so maybe they will.

317
00:19:27,895 --> 00:19:29,890
Don't count on it.

318
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:32,465
We need to find a way
to get off this station.

319
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,110
Once we do,
we'll figure out a way

320
00:19:35,152 --> 00:19:36,622
to free your family.

321
00:19:36,723 --> 00:19:38,125
Then what?

322
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:39,461
We'll hide in the hills.

323
00:19:39,498 --> 00:19:40,934
We'll join the resistance.

324
00:19:40,969 --> 00:19:43,306
I suppose that's possible.

325
00:19:43,344 --> 00:19:45,373
Of course, it is.

326
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,822
Till then, we'll just
need to bide our...

327
00:19:52,306 --> 00:19:53,833
I'm sorry.

328
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,426
I failed to show
a Cardassian soldier

329
00:19:59,462 --> 00:20:00,898
the proper respect.

330
00:20:02,974 --> 00:20:06,348
We all have scars
of one kind or another.

331
00:20:06,384 --> 00:20:08,049
Maybe...

332
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,724
but most aren't
quite so evident.

333
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,093
It's not so bad.

334
00:20:26,582 --> 00:20:28,919
Why do you keep doing that?

335
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,566
What?

336
00:20:33,604 --> 00:20:34,698
Helping me.

337
00:20:35,912 --> 00:20:39,412
First, at the refugee
center and now here.

338
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,230
I don't have many friends.

339
00:20:45,108 --> 00:20:46,202
Well...

340
00:20:47,883 --> 00:20:49,752
you have one now.

341
00:20:54,638 --> 00:20:56,074
Well done.

342
00:20:56,109 --> 00:20:58,743
I can hardly believe
you're the same women

343
00:20:58,785 --> 00:21:01,589
I met yesterday.

344
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:05,093
In fact, you're not.

345
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,704
Your old lives have ended.

346
00:21:07,747 --> 00:21:10,951
Your pasts have been erased.

347
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:15,163
You have one purpose
and one purpose only...

348
00:21:15,204 --> 00:21:17,199
to provide comfort and care

349
00:21:17,244 --> 00:21:19,912
to the Cardassian officers
stationed here.

350
00:21:21,825 --> 00:21:24,976
Do that well,
and you'll want for nothing.

351
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:26,978
Fail and you and your family

352
00:21:27,015 --> 00:21:29,113
will be sent to a labor camp.

353
00:21:29,156 --> 00:21:31,629
Now, remember, ladies...

354
00:21:31,663 --> 00:21:33,498
you're all easily replaceable.

355
00:21:33,537 --> 00:21:35,874
Make one mistake
and I won't hesitate to...

356
00:21:35,911 --> 00:21:36,902
Basso!

357
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,386
That's enough.

358
00:21:44,672 --> 00:21:46,804
Welcome...

359
00:21:46,846 --> 00:21:49,412
to Terok Nor.

360
00:21:49,453 --> 00:21:52,429
I hope your stay here
will be a pleasant one.

361
00:21:52,463 --> 00:21:55,336
I assure you, I will do
everything possible

362
00:21:55,372 --> 00:21:57,845
to make it so.

363
00:21:57,881 --> 00:22:02,020
I suspect that many of you
must be feeling a bit...

364
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,827
uneasy right now.

365
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:08,313
I'm well aware that among
the Bajoran population

366
00:22:08,381 --> 00:22:11,083
there is a perception
that all Cardassians

367
00:22:11,123 --> 00:22:15,262
are to be feared,
that we are a cruel

368
00:22:15,303 --> 00:22:17,275
and heartless people.

369
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,510
I hope to change that...

370
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:22,354
not with words,
but with actions...

371
00:22:22,459 --> 00:22:26,164
in the hope that you will come
to appreciate

372
00:22:26,204 --> 00:22:28,700
the better part of our nature.

373
00:22:28,746 --> 00:22:31,380
I assure you...

374
00:22:31,488 --> 00:22:34,395
we are capable
of great kindness.

375
00:22:34,497 --> 00:22:37,267
What of our families?
Are they all right?

376
00:22:37,307 --> 00:22:39,405
Who said you could speak?!
Guards!

377
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,973
Stay where you are.

378
00:22:46,836 --> 00:22:49,367
Your families...

379
00:22:49,412 --> 00:22:52,684
will be well taken care of.

380
00:22:52,722 --> 00:22:56,130
That, I promise you.

381
00:23:02,988 --> 00:23:05,359
What is this?

382
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:07,593
I...

383
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,696
Basso...

384
00:23:09,744 --> 00:23:10,907
Forgive me, Prefect.

385
00:23:10,947 --> 00:23:13,045
I... didn't notice
the imperfection.

386
00:23:13,087 --> 00:23:14,786
I'll have her removed at once.

387
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,457
Get me a dermal regenerator.

388
00:23:16,499 --> 00:23:17,627
- But...
- Now.

389
00:23:21,414 --> 00:23:25,051
I'm afraid to ask
how you came by such a mark.

390
00:23:25,092 --> 00:23:26,460
It's nothing.

391
00:23:26,496 --> 00:23:28,935
On the contrary.

392
00:23:28,971 --> 00:23:32,038
It's an unfortunate reminder
of the gulf

393
00:23:32,081 --> 00:23:34,350
that exists
between our two peoples.

394
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,334
It must be removed...
immediately.

395
00:23:41,244 --> 00:23:43,148
Just relax.

396
00:23:43,183 --> 00:23:44,882
It's all right.

397
00:23:47,932 --> 00:23:49,597
Relax.

398
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,321
There.

399
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:03,245
Beautiful.

400
00:24:06,926 --> 00:24:08,522
Carry on.

401
00:24:12,343 --> 00:24:15,683
Well, I'd say congratulations
are in order.

402
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:18,594
You've all passed
your first test.

403
00:24:33,886 --> 00:24:35,585
Sit down and drink with me.

404
00:24:44,588 --> 00:24:46,788
Mind telling me
what you're smiling about?

405
00:24:46,828 --> 00:24:49,359
The Prophets.

406
00:24:49,402 --> 00:24:52,241
I never realized they had
such a sense of humor.

407
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:53,373
When I was a child

408
00:24:53,415 --> 00:24:55,752
I dreamed of having
enough food to eat

409
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,697
and pretty clothes to wear,
and now look at me.

410
00:24:58,733 --> 00:25:02,233
I have everything I ever wanted,
and I feel horrible.

411
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:04,513
That is pretty funny
in a horrible way.

412
00:25:06,926 --> 00:25:09,457
I suppose
if I can survive starvation

413
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:10,994
I can survive this.

414
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,505
After all, we Bajorans
can survive anything.

415
00:25:15,988 --> 00:25:17,549
You.

416
00:25:17,593 --> 00:25:19,531
Think you can stand there

417
00:25:19,566 --> 00:25:21,869
hiding in a corner all night?

418
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,760
I don't remember seeing you
before.

419
00:25:29,798 --> 00:25:32,101
I just arrived yesterday.

420
00:25:32,139 --> 00:25:33,974
And I bet I know
what you're thinking.

421
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:36,645
You'd like nothing better
than to get us all drunk

422
00:25:36,687 --> 00:25:38,751
so you could kill
us in our sleep.

423
00:25:38,794 --> 00:25:40,561
Are you sure
you're not part Betazoid?

424
00:25:42,104 --> 00:25:43,335
Come.

425
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,374
Sit on my lap...

426
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:52,530
and tell me how much you hate
Cardassians.

427
00:25:52,571 --> 00:25:57,041
You Bajoran women,
you're all so bony.

428
00:25:57,086 --> 00:25:59,686
That's because you Cardassians
eat all our food.

429
00:26:00,764 --> 00:26:03,295
You know, I could
have you executed

430
00:26:03,339 --> 00:26:05,311
for that kind of insolence.

431
00:26:05,345 --> 00:26:07,841
And that's one of the reasons
we hate you so much.

432
00:26:09,926 --> 00:26:11,727
Clever girl.

433
00:26:11,766 --> 00:26:14,035
Now, pour me
some more of that <i>kanar</i>

434
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:16,979
and let's see if we can't
work out our differences.

435
00:26:32,164 --> 00:26:33,464
Let her go.

436
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:38,508
I said let her go.

437
00:26:38,551 --> 00:26:39,816
All I said to her was...

438
00:26:39,856 --> 00:26:41,657
I don't care
what you were saying.

439
00:26:41,695 --> 00:26:44,261
I don't like
what you were doing.

440
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,572
Now, get away from her.

441
00:26:49,888 --> 00:26:51,621
Are you all right?

442
00:26:53,098 --> 00:26:55,367
Basso...

443
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:58,506
escort this woman
back to her quarters,

444
00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:00,544
and see that her privacy

445
00:27:00,588 --> 00:27:01,557
is respected.

446
00:27:01,592 --> 00:27:03,564
She will not be disturbed.

447
00:27:03,598 --> 00:27:06,094
I only hope
you won't condemn us all

448
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,446
for the boorish behavior
of one man.

449
00:27:11,991 --> 00:27:13,929
I only hope
you won't condemn us all

450
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:18,035
for the boorish behavior
of one man.

451
00:27:26,739 --> 00:27:28,768
How did you know
he was going to say that?

452
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:33,216
Let's just say this is not
the first performance I've seen

453
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:36,463
of this little... melodrama.

454
00:27:36,503 --> 00:27:39,502
That woman should consider
herself fortunate.

455
00:27:39,546 --> 00:27:41,951
She's caught the Prefect's eye.

456
00:27:41,987 --> 00:27:45,487
As of now, she's off limits
to the rest of us.

457
00:27:45,532 --> 00:27:46,626
As for you...

458
00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:48,538
I know.

459
00:27:48,575 --> 00:27:51,379
I know... more <i>kanar.</i>

460
00:28:04,358 --> 00:28:05,384
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

461
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:07,527
Now, one foot
in front of another.

462
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:09,404
Don't tell me what to do.

463
00:28:09,442 --> 00:28:11,915
I'll put my feet
wherever I want.

464
00:28:11,949 --> 00:28:13,283
I'm a Cardassian.

465
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,483
Whatever you say.

466
00:28:14,525 --> 00:28:16,794
Just try not to stumble
out of any airlocks

467
00:28:16,832 --> 00:28:18,302
on your way home.

468
00:28:18,336 --> 00:28:20,673
I'm not going home;
I'm coming in with you.

469
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:21,679
No, you're not.

470
00:28:21,714 --> 00:28:23,413
You're going
back to your quarters

471
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:24,820
and you're going to sleep.

472
00:28:24,857 --> 00:28:27,559
I want comfort,
and I want it now.

473
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:29,731
You are a comfort woman,
aren't you?

474
00:28:29,773 --> 00:28:30,833
You're dressed like one.

475
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:32,906
Oh, don't let appearances
fool you.

476
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,352
Mm. That mouth of yours

477
00:28:34,387 --> 00:28:36,758
is going to get you
in trouble someday.

478
00:28:36,796 --> 00:28:40,296
Now, let's go get some... sleep.

479
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:43,109
I have a better idea.

480
00:28:43,149 --> 00:28:44,676
You go sleep in your quarters.

481
00:28:44,721 --> 00:28:46,990
I'll sleep in mine,
and tomorrow...

482
00:28:47,028 --> 00:28:51,098
Tomorrow, you'll be all mine
to do with as I please.

483
00:28:51,141 --> 00:28:52,874
Oh, I can hardly wait.

484
00:28:57,896 --> 00:28:59,800
Meru, I'm back.

485
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:02,466
I'm going to have
to shower for a week

486
00:29:02,511 --> 00:29:04,176
to get the smell
of that Legate off of me.

487
00:29:04,216 --> 00:29:06,655
I'll be sure to tell him
you said that.

488
00:29:06,691 --> 00:29:07,956
What are you doing here?

489
00:29:07,995 --> 00:29:09,158
Where's Meru?

490
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:10,932
Looks like you're going
to have these quarters

491
00:29:10,972 --> 00:29:12,739
all to yourself, at least
for a little while.

492
00:29:12,777 --> 00:29:14,145
I said where's Meru?

493
00:29:14,182 --> 00:29:15,847
She's moving up in the world.

494
00:29:15,886 --> 00:29:18,690
Your friend must have hidden
talents I wasn't aware of.

495
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,599
Our beloved Prefect
has invited her

496
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:21,935
to share his quarters.

497
00:29:21,973 --> 00:29:23,273
I want to see her.

498
00:29:23,311 --> 00:29:24,645
Do you?

499
00:29:24,682 --> 00:29:26,449
I said take me to her!

500
00:29:26,488 --> 00:29:27,479
Hey!

501
00:30:23,584 --> 00:30:26,754
So, tell me, how's work going
on the ore processing center?

502
00:30:26,794 --> 00:30:28,629
You ought to join
the work detail sometime...

503
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:29,726
find out for yourself.

504
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:30,898
All in good time.

505
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,240
Once the center's up and running

506
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:33,839
we'll all be slaving
away down there.

507
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:43,470
I have news for you.

508
00:30:43,514 --> 00:30:45,383
About my friend?

509
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,913
I know why you haven't
heard from her

510
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:47,927
in the last few weeks.

511
00:30:47,962 --> 00:30:49,296
She hasn't been on the station.

512
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:50,564
What are you talking about?

513
00:30:50,671 --> 00:30:52,575
Word has it she's been off

514
00:30:52,677 --> 00:30:55,516
on a little vacation
with Gul Dukat.

515
00:30:55,552 --> 00:30:57,787
They just got back today.

516
00:30:59,297 --> 00:31:00,665
Why is that woman
so important to you?

517
00:31:00,703 --> 00:31:01,900
She's nothing
but a collaborator.

518
00:31:01,939 --> 00:31:04,037
She is not a collaborator.

519
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,748
She's a comfort woman
for the spoonheads, isn't she?

520
00:31:06,788 --> 00:31:09,057
Mm-hmm. So was I.

521
00:31:09,096 --> 00:31:11,091
For a day.

522
00:31:12,774 --> 00:31:14,906
But I've been watching you.

523
00:31:14,948 --> 00:31:17,285
You have no love
for the spoonheads.

524
00:31:17,322 --> 00:31:18,291
Neither does my friend.

525
00:31:18,325 --> 00:31:19,590
Look, I told you already.

526
00:31:19,663 --> 00:31:21,898
I don't want to join
your resistance cell.

527
00:31:21,936 --> 00:31:23,270
Just leave me alone.

528
00:31:23,308 --> 00:31:24,505
I will.

529
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:27,610
I promise.

530
00:31:27,722 --> 00:31:30,161
But first, I need for you
to draw a map for me.

531
00:31:31,968 --> 00:31:33,302
A map of what?

532
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,640
The Cardy side of the station.

533
00:31:34,677 --> 00:31:37,345
Well, like you said,
I was only there one day.

534
00:31:37,386 --> 00:31:39,655
Well, anything
you remember will help...

535
00:31:39,693 --> 00:31:41,928
quarters, corridors,
meeting rooms.

536
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:44,202
Why? What are you planning?

537
00:31:44,241 --> 00:31:46,179
It doesn't concern you.

538
00:31:49,057 --> 00:31:50,357
Now, are you going
to help us or not?

539
00:31:51,364 --> 00:31:52,834
You.

540
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,169
Follow me.

541
00:32:13,401 --> 00:32:15,066
You may enter.

542
00:32:21,594 --> 00:32:22,722
Luma.

543
00:32:25,573 --> 00:32:28,572
Oh! Are you all right?

544
00:32:28,617 --> 00:32:30,681
I've been worried about you
since the night they took you.

545
00:32:30,723 --> 00:32:31,749
I know.

546
00:32:31,793 --> 00:32:33,526
I wanted to get
a message to you.

547
00:32:33,565 --> 00:32:35,560
Has he hurt you?

548
00:32:35,605 --> 00:32:37,634
Who?

549
00:32:37,678 --> 00:32:39,114
Dukat.

550
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:41,750
Hurt me?

551
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:42,782
No.

552
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:44,663
He hasn't hurt me.

553
00:32:46,473 --> 00:32:48,810
I, I wish I knew
how to explain to you

554
00:32:48,914 --> 00:32:50,407
these past few weeks...

555
00:32:50,452 --> 00:32:52,424
make you understand.

556
00:32:52,459 --> 00:32:54,431
Understand what?

557
00:32:54,465 --> 00:32:59,003
That I'm not
the monster you think I am.

558
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:01,782
You see?

559
00:33:01,822 --> 00:33:03,349
I told you

560
00:33:03,394 --> 00:33:05,366
I'd find a big enough vase.

561
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,600
What do you think?

562
00:33:08,644 --> 00:33:10,411
They're beautiful.

563
00:33:16,135 --> 00:33:19,236
I don't think your friend
approves of the flowers.

564
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:21,273
Or of me.

565
00:33:23,157 --> 00:33:24,856
Meru...

566
00:33:24,929 --> 00:33:27,198
are you sure this is the woman

567
00:33:27,236 --> 00:33:29,300
you want as your companion?

568
00:33:29,343 --> 00:33:31,178
Yes.

569
00:33:31,216 --> 00:33:33,416
As you wish.

570
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:39,743
The fact is...

571
00:33:39,777 --> 00:33:43,516
I've treated Meru
with nothing but kindness

572
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:45,288
and consideration.

573
00:33:45,328 --> 00:33:47,528
If you don't believe me

574
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:48,799
ask her.

575
00:33:52,818 --> 00:33:53,787
I'll be back

576
00:33:53,822 --> 00:33:55,726
as soon as this meeting
is finished.

577
00:34:08,334 --> 00:34:09,930
It's true.

578
00:34:09,973 --> 00:34:13,747
He's very different
from what I expected.

579
00:34:15,758 --> 00:34:17,593
Don't let that smile
fool you.

580
00:34:17,631 --> 00:34:18,965
He's still the enemy.

581
00:34:19,035 --> 00:34:21,601
It's not that simple.

582
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:23,513
Yes.

583
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,815
It is.

584
00:34:26,158 --> 00:34:29,532
Meru... listen to me.

585
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:32,373
While you're in here
playing parlor games

586
00:34:32,411 --> 00:34:35,250
he's busy carrying out
the extermination of our people.

587
00:34:35,288 --> 00:34:36,953
That's not true.

588
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,462
He's written to Central Command

589
00:34:38,498 --> 00:34:40,937
urging them to rethink
their policy towards Bajor.

590
00:34:40,972 --> 00:34:41,998
I don't care

591
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:43,809
if he played you
a holo-recording

592
00:34:43,847 --> 00:34:45,044
of him on his hand and knees

593
00:34:45,152 --> 00:34:47,056
begging Central Command
to end the occupation.

594
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:49,063
It would still be a lie!

595
00:34:49,131 --> 00:34:50,727
Like that first night
when he saved you

596
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:52,070
from that Gul...
that wasn't real.

597
00:34:52,175 --> 00:34:54,648
He set the whole thing up
to win you over.

598
00:34:54,682 --> 00:34:56,415
He told me.

599
00:34:56,455 --> 00:34:58,519
He tells me everything.

600
00:34:58,562 --> 00:34:59,725
You just don't know him.

601
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:01,897
I don't need to know him.

602
00:35:01,939 --> 00:35:04,846
I know the things he's done.

603
00:35:04,882 --> 00:35:07,014
Look what he did to you.

604
00:35:07,055 --> 00:35:09,586
He took you away
from your family...

605
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,964
from your children.

606
00:35:11,001 --> 00:35:12,870
He's promised to help them.

607
00:35:12,907 --> 00:35:15,507
He's going to send them food
and medical supplies.

608
00:35:15,549 --> 00:35:17,784
That still
doesn't make it right.

609
00:35:17,823 --> 00:35:20,058
What about your husband?

610
00:35:20,097 --> 00:35:22,229
Taban loves you.

611
00:35:22,271 --> 00:35:25,247
How can you forget him
so quickly?

612
00:35:26,284 --> 00:35:29,283
I have not forgotten him.

613
00:35:29,326 --> 00:35:31,424
What do you expect me to do?

614
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:34,271
Kick and bite Dukat every
time he comes near me?

615
00:35:34,309 --> 00:35:37,878
How is that going to help
Taban or the children?

616
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,151
Oh, is that what you
tell yourself...

617
00:35:39,191 --> 00:35:40,525
that you're doing it
for the children,

618
00:35:40,562 --> 00:35:42,534
the clothes, the food,
the easy living...

619
00:35:42,568 --> 00:35:43,970
that you're doing
it all for them?

620
00:35:44,006 --> 00:35:44,975
Are you that deluded?

621
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,709
It's not for them.

622
00:35:46,748 --> 00:35:48,275
It's for you.

623
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,759
You like it here.

624
00:35:50,794 --> 00:35:53,530
You enjoy playing house
with that murderer.

625
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,975
Don't you see what you are?

626
00:35:56,012 --> 00:35:58,417
What you've allowed
yourself to become?

627
00:35:58,452 --> 00:36:00,755
You're a collaborator.

628
00:36:00,793 --> 00:36:02,424
A collaborator?

629
00:36:02,465 --> 00:36:04,130
Because I share Dukat's bed?

630
00:36:04,171 --> 00:36:05,870
No, because you like
sharing his bed...

631
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,711
because you've fallen
in love with him!

632
00:36:08,819 --> 00:36:10,289
Where are you going?

633
00:36:10,324 --> 00:36:11,624
Back where I belong.

634
00:36:18,516 --> 00:36:21,012
It's composed of ultritium resin

635
00:36:21,058 --> 00:36:22,221
which means it's doubtful

636
00:36:22,329 --> 00:36:24,564
that the Cardassian
sensors will pick it up.

637
00:36:24,603 --> 00:36:26,472
Of course,
there's always a chance.

638
00:36:26,509 --> 00:36:28,709
You let me worry about that.

639
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,189
You sound like you've
done this before.

640
00:36:31,224 --> 00:36:33,128
You'd be surprised.

641
00:36:33,163 --> 00:36:34,257
Remember...

642
00:36:34,334 --> 00:36:35,736
the bomb is set to go off

643
00:36:35,772 --> 00:36:37,744
three minutes
after it's activated.

644
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:41,723
And once it's activated,
it cannot be disarmed.

645
00:36:41,757 --> 00:36:44,733
So make sure you have
enough time to get away.

646
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:47,743
How large of a blast radius
are we talking about?

647
00:36:47,776 --> 00:36:49,303
20 meters.

648
00:36:49,382 --> 00:36:52,323
I suggest you plant it
somewhere in Dukat's quarters.

649
00:36:52,392 --> 00:36:55,026
I'll pick the right spot for it.

650
00:36:55,066 --> 00:36:57,597
What about
that Bajoran mistress of his?

651
00:36:57,641 --> 00:36:59,009
What about her?

652
00:36:59,046 --> 00:37:01,281
You cannot risk telling her
what you're doing...

653
00:37:02,557 --> 00:37:04,826
not even to save her life.

654
00:37:04,865 --> 00:37:07,932
Why would I do that?

655
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,677
Like you said,
she's a collaborator.

656
00:37:14,395 --> 00:37:16,561
She deserves whatever she gets.

657
00:37:31,437 --> 00:37:34,538
I'm beginning to find
you very tiresome.

658
00:37:34,581 --> 00:37:36,416
Yeah, I don't like
you much either.

659
00:37:36,453 --> 00:37:38,220
Now, I need you
to take me to Kira Meru.

660
00:37:38,259 --> 00:37:39,958
I have better things to do

661
00:37:39,998 --> 00:37:42,494
than to shuttle you
around this station.

662
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,744
It's time you decided which side
of this gate you want to be on.

663
00:37:45,783 --> 00:37:47,014
I have.

664
00:37:47,054 --> 00:37:50,828
Now, take me to Kira
so that I can apologize to her.

665
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:53,033
Guard.

666
00:37:54,478 --> 00:37:55,778
A wise decision.

667
00:38:35,409 --> 00:38:37,814
I didn't expect
to see you again.

668
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:40,882
I came because I owe you
an apology.

669
00:38:40,993 --> 00:38:43,593
The things I said,
they were unfair.

670
00:38:43,635 --> 00:38:46,074
I'd like us to be friends again.

671
00:38:46,109 --> 00:38:48,104
So would I.

672
00:38:49,687 --> 00:38:52,355
Whatever makes you happy,
my dear.

673
00:38:58,983 --> 00:39:00,544
Can I get you something?

674
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:01,558
Maybe later.

675
00:39:01,592 --> 00:39:02,892
All right.

676
00:39:02,996 --> 00:39:05,162
First thing we do is get you
some new quarters

677
00:39:05,203 --> 00:39:06,400
something close by.

678
00:39:06,441 --> 00:39:07,672
Sounds good.

679
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:08,909
I have a copy

680
00:39:08,948 --> 00:39:11,114
of that transmission
you requested.

681
00:39:11,156 --> 00:39:12,683
Ah, thank you, Basso.

682
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:13,697
That'll be all.

683
00:39:13,731 --> 00:39:15,897
What about her?

684
00:39:17,476 --> 00:39:20,280
Don't concern yourself
with Luma.

685
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:23,955
She's not going to cause us
any more trouble, are you?

686
00:39:24,064 --> 00:39:25,500
That's not what I'm here for.

687
00:39:25,535 --> 00:39:26,971
No, it isn't.

688
00:39:28,812 --> 00:39:31,251
Well, Basso, you heard...
find her some new quarters.

689
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,346
Right away.

690
00:39:34,028 --> 00:39:36,160
This is for you.

691
00:39:36,202 --> 00:39:39,440
I think you'll find it
very interesting.

692
00:39:39,479 --> 00:39:42,352
I'll be in my study
if you need me.

693
00:40:02,871 --> 00:40:05,140
I'll see to my quarters.

694
00:40:05,178 --> 00:40:06,648
Okay, Luma.

695
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:13,027
Meru, I hope the Cardassians
aren't lying to me

696
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:15,806
and that they really
will send this message to you.

697
00:40:15,845 --> 00:40:17,510
I know it's only
been a few weeks

698
00:40:17,551 --> 00:40:20,686
that we've been back home,
but you should see the children.

699
00:40:20,728 --> 00:40:22,997
It's like they've been
transformed.

700
00:40:23,035 --> 00:40:26,409
Reon and Pohl are laughing
and playing together.

701
00:40:26,446 --> 00:40:28,111
They've never been happier.

702
00:40:28,151 --> 00:40:31,890
And I swear, little Nerys
must have gained five pounds.

703
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:34,964
Of course,
they keep asking for you.

704
00:40:35,007 --> 00:40:38,142
I've told them that you're
still at the refugee center.

705
00:40:38,183 --> 00:40:41,124
I think that's best,
at least for the time being.

706
00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:45,063
I can't believe
how much I miss you.

707
00:40:45,105 --> 00:40:47,636
I think about you all the time.

708
00:40:47,714 --> 00:40:51,122
You've saved all our lives.

709
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:53,359
I hope you realize that.

710
00:40:53,399 --> 00:40:56,169
Never forget it,
not even for an instant.

711
00:40:56,208 --> 00:40:59,081
Every day,
I pray to the Prophets

712
00:40:59,117 --> 00:41:03,324
that you'll find some peace
in this new life of yours.

713
00:41:03,364 --> 00:41:07,206
I believe that even
in the worst of times

714
00:41:07,243 --> 00:41:11,245
we can still find moments
of joy and kindness.

715
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:15,759
If you can find
that kindness, hold on to it.

716
00:41:15,804 --> 00:41:19,339
And remember, no matter
what happens...

717
00:41:19,382 --> 00:41:22,016
I love you, Meru.

718
00:41:23,227 --> 00:41:25,028
I'll always love you.

719
00:41:29,481 --> 00:41:30,883
Come on, we've got
to get out of here.

720
00:41:30,919 --> 00:41:31,888
Why?

721
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:33,553
Dukat, get out here, now!
Go!

722
00:41:33,594 --> 00:41:34,620
What?

723
00:41:34,664 --> 00:41:35,655
There's a bomb.

724
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,691
Meru!

725
00:41:38,743 --> 00:41:39,734
Get out of the way!

726
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:48,769
Meru...

727
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:50,368
Meru.

728
00:42:15,695 --> 00:42:18,329
I've always hated collaborators.

729
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:21,243
I mean, what could be worse
than betraying your own people?

730
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,815
During the occupation,
if I ever had any doubt

731
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,360
about what their fate should be

732
00:42:26,396 --> 00:42:28,494
I would think of my mother...

733
00:42:28,535 --> 00:42:30,096
how she gave her life for Bajor.

734
00:42:30,141 --> 00:42:32,079
She was a hero.

735
00:42:32,114 --> 00:42:33,379
They were traitors.

736
00:42:33,418 --> 00:42:34,683
It was that simple.

737
00:42:34,722 --> 00:42:36,717
Or so I thought.

738
00:42:39,237 --> 00:42:42,213
She did what she had to do
to save her family...

739
00:42:42,247 --> 00:42:43,683
to save you.

740
00:42:43,718 --> 00:42:46,021
It doesn't make it right.

741
00:42:46,058 --> 00:42:47,358
Maybe not

742
00:42:47,396 --> 00:42:50,337
but it was her decision to make.

743
00:42:56,692 --> 00:42:58,493
I did some checking.

744
00:42:58,531 --> 00:43:01,267
She died
in a Cardassian hospital

745
00:43:01,307 --> 00:43:05,218
seven years after she
met Dukat... seven years.

746
00:43:05,253 --> 00:43:06,621
Do you know how many Bajorans

747
00:43:06,657 --> 00:43:08,721
died in the labor camps
during that time...

748
00:43:08,764 --> 00:43:14,271
died... while my mother sat
sipping <i>kanar</i> with Dukat?

749
00:43:20,301 --> 00:43:22,706
Tell me something, Nerys.

750
00:43:22,742 --> 00:43:27,416
If you hate her that much,
why did you save her life?

751
00:43:27,457 --> 00:43:29,486
Believe me...

752
00:43:31,671 --> 00:43:35,115
there's a part of me
that wishes that I hadn't.

753
00:43:39,863 --> 00:43:41,767
But the fact is...

754
00:43:44,211 --> 00:43:46,548
no matter what she did...

755
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:51,827
she was still my mother.
