1
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,469
The<i> Saratoga</i> put
in this morning.

2
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,095
We are not having
another party.

3
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:14,139
I promise, not more
than 50 or 60...

4
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,599
I can see it now.

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,019
200 people jammed into
our quarters-- eating,

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,062
drinking, laughing.

7
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:23,148
Sounds awful.

8
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,566
What if I promise

9
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:25,943
absolutely
no laughing?

10
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,611
No, I mean it.

11
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,905
You won't see a single
smile the entire evening.

12
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,282
It'll be the grimmest party
you've ever been to.

13
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,578
When do you want
to have this party?

14
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,914
Next week.
And I was thinking

15
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:41,583
maybe this evening
should have... a theme.

16
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,460
What kind of theme?

17
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,338
What if everyone came as
their favorite Klingon?

18
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:49,174
Bad idea.

19
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,343
Commander,
your holosuite is ready.

20
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,013
Good.

21
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:56,390
Have fun exercising.

22
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,060
No party?

23
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,229
I came this close.

24
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,689
(<i> groans</i> )

25
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,775
Thank you, Quark.

26
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:07,860
Don't mention it, Major.

27
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,110
Glad to be of help.

28
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,988
Bajoran lilacs.

29
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,034
Is there something going on
between the two of you

30
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:16,035
that I don't know about?

31
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:17,745
Oh, don't be disgusting.

32
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,041
I ordered them
for myself.

33
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,542
Well, that's nice.

34
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,419
I thought you
didn't like flowers.

35
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,420
I don't.

36
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,171
I'm confused.

37
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,549
Jadzia, there's
such a thing as privacy.

38
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:31,926
Not between friends.

39
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:34,803
It's my mother's birthday.

40
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,638
She would've been 60 today,

41
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,682
and my father always said
that these were her favorite.

42
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,684
That's a nice way
to remember your mother.

43
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:42,394
I wish I did
remember her.

44
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:43,896
I was only three

45
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:45,480
when she died
at the refugee center.

46
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,149
Well, I bet she'd
be proud of you

47
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,777
and what you've done
with your life.

48
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:52,613
Hmm. I'd like to think so.

49
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,364
I've always been
proud of her.

50
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,533
My father always said...

51
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,745
she was the bravest woman
he ever met.

52
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:19,890
COMPUTER:
Major Kira, you have
an incoming transmission.

53
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,353
From whom?

54
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,522
Unable to identify.

55
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,066
(<i> sighs</i> )

56
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,488
Oh...

57
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,324
Put it through.

58
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,835
Ah, Major, there you are.

59
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,670
I'm sorry to wake you.

60
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,005
What the hell
do you want, Dukat?

61
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,714
Oh, don't bother, Major.

62
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:56,010
I guarantee you won't be able
to trace this transmission.

63
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,471
Well, then, why don't you
just tell me where you are?

64
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:02,057
Because that's not why I called.

65
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:06,770
I want to help you, Major,
the way Captain Sisko helped me.

66
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,148
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

67
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:13,443
Captain Sisko
gave me the clarity

68
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,654
to see beyond the lies...

69
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:19,783
the self-deceptions
that were controlling my life.

70
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:23,578
He helped me to see
the truth about myself,

71
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:28,750
and now, I'm going to do
the same for you.

72
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:34,506
And what better day to do it
than on your mother's birthday.

73
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,299
Was that supposed to upset me?

74
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,969
That you know
it's my mother's birthday?

75
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,513
She was a striking woman,
your mother--

76
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,849
although when we first met,

77
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:47,227
she was very self-conscious
about that scar

78
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,064
along the side of her face.

79
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:54,275
She used to try to cover it up
with a strand of hair.

80
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,945
Nice try, Dukat...

81
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,740
but you never knew my mother.

82
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,117
She died in the...

83
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,827
The Singha refugee center?

84
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,538
I'm afraid not, Major.

85
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:09,249
That was something
your father told you

86
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,502
because he couldn't bear
to face the truth.

87
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,504
What truth?

88
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,635
That your mother left him...

89
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,637
to be with me.

90
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,514
(<i> laughing</i> )

91
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,226
Oh, you're lying.

92
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:32,231
Your mother and I were lovers
almost from the moment we met.

93
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:36,068
And we remained lovers
until the day she died.

94
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,361
I have had enough of this.

95
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,990
I see you have lilacs
on your nightstand.

96
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,451
Your mother
would've been touched.

97
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,912
She loved Bajoran lilacs.

98
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,873
There.

99
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,586
I told you the truth
was liberating, Major.

100
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:58,423
Now, don't you feel better?

101
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,050
I do.

102
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:15,643
Computer, locate
Cardassian occupation files

103
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,478
Singha refugee center.

104
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:22,776
Find and display Bajoran
identity profile: Kira Meru.

105
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,795
O'BRIEN:
You're just going to have
to take my word for it.

106
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,171
The Battle of the Alamo

107
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,090
would make a hell of
a holosuite program.

108
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,383
BASHIR:
All right, all right.

109
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:47,592
Let me get this straight
because I...

110
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,552
There are 200 of us

111
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,721
trapped inside some crumbling
old mission or whatever,

112
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,515
surrounded
by<i> 2,000</i> enemy troops.

113
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,559
Is that right?
That's right.

114
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,104
Do we win?
No, we lose.

115
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:02,149
Why do you want
to play a program
where we lose?

116
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,566
O'BRIEN:
Well, you're missing
the point.

117
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,485
There's nothing
more noble

118
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,112
than a heroic defeat,
especially against

119
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,655
overwhelming odds.

120
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,782
In<i> life</i> maybe,
but not in
the holosuite.

121
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:14,161
Chief, you were supposed
to have finished recalibrating

122
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,288
those induction modulators
yesterday.

123
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:18,957
Yeah, we had a bit of a problem
replacing some of the coil...

124
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,542
Save the excuses.
I want it done within the hour.

125
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,420
Doctor, is there a reason
for your visit?

126
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,047
What?

127
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,258
Actually, Miles and I were...

128
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,218
Thought not.

129
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,636
We're on duty here
if you don't mind.

130
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,639
I don't want to interfere.

131
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,865
Well, all right, everyone,
we're not at the Replimat.

132
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,367
We're not here
to drink<i> raktajinos</i>

133
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,868
and catch up
on the latest gossip.

134
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,786
Let's get to work.

135
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,705
(<i> sighs</i> )

136
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,386
Odo, I've just
been informed

137
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:15,514
of the increased criminal
activity on the Promenade.

138
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:18,099
It's not as bad
as it sounds, Major.

139
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,810
We're talking about
a few incidents of petty theft.

140
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,812
I've already assigned
two deputies.

141
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,899
I'd prefer that you handle
the matter yourself.

142
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,653
If you think it's necessary.

143
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,531
I do.

144
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:35,283
And make sure that you keep me
informed of your progress.

145
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,702
Of course.

146
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,000
Is there something else
on your mind?

147
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,710
Meaning what?

148
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,172
Meaning I talked
with Dr. Bashir.

149
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,258
He told me
that you seemed irritable.

150
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,510
I see he's
not exaggerating.

151
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,888
Would you care to tell me
what's bothering you?

152
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,226
I appreciate the offer, Odo,

153
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:05,272
but I don't think talking
about it is going to help.

154
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,023
Sounds serious.

155
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,775
It is.

156
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,406
Well, if you won't
talk about it,

157
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:18,577
perhaps you should consider
<i>doing</i> something about it.

158
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,337
A transmission from Gul Dukat?

159
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,838
This is the first
I've heard of it.

160
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,840
That's because
I didn't report it.

161
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,217
Why not?

162
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,885
It was of a personal nature.

163
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,596
I tried to trace the signal,
but...

164
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,223
What did he want?

165
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,644
He said he knew my mother,
that they were lovers.

166
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,732
You don't believe him, do you?

167
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,692
He knew certain things
about her.

168
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,236
Personal things.

169
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,655
Well, Gul Dukat is
a very resourceful man.

170
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,532
I'm sure he knows
a lot about your family--

171
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,159
about<i> all</i> of our families.

172
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,996
I keep trying to tell myself
that, but I need to know.

173
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,416
That may not be possible, Major.

174
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,042
There is a way.

175
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,420
I can visit
the temple of Iponu on Bajor

176
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,172
and consult the Orb of Time.

177
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,423
Excuse me?

178
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,008
I need to know the truth.

179
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,429
Let me get this straight.

180
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,055
You want to travel
back in time

181
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,183
to see if Gul Dukat and
your mother were lovers.

182
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,809
That's right.

183
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,311
Major, the Federation

184
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,021
has very strict
regulations concern...

185
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,440
This has nothing to do
with the Federation.

186
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,858
I need your help

187
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,528
as the Emissary,
not a Starfleet Captain.

188
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,655
The Emissary can see to it

189
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:38,406
that I am allowed access
to the Orb.

190
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,326
After that,
it's up to the Prophets.

191
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:44,954
If they feel
that my request is worthy,

192
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,165
they'll send me
where I need to go.

193
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,917
If not, I've made a trip
to Bajor for nothing.

194
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,423
And if they do send you back?

195
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,050
What then?

196
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,801
What makes you so sure

197
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,638
you won't interfere
with the timeline?

198
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,015
The Prophets
will be guiding me.

199
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,560
Nothing will happen
without their blessings.

200
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,436
Please, Emissary.

201
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,855
Please...

202
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,274
let me seek the will
of the Prophets.

203
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,573
(<i> birds twittering</i> )

204
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,774

206
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,206
Thank you.

207
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,279
MAN:
Meru,

208
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,072
I found Nerys.

209
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,118
(<i> sighs</i> )

210
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,711
MERU:
Where was she?

211
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:59,714
Wandering over there,
scrounging for food.

212
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:02,383
Come here, sweetie,
beside me, here.

213
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,552
Is that all?
That's barely half a cup.

214
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,970
They've cut
everyone's rations.

215
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,138
It's not enough.

216
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,307
How do they expect us
to survive?

217
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,559
MERU:
The Cardassians don't care
whether or not we survive.

218
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,269
They won't be happy
until we're all dead.

219
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,104
Come here, sweetie,
come here.
Have some soup.

220
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:19,192
Excuse me.
That soup... it's ours.

221
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,527
What are you talking about?

222
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:21,861
My wife stood in line
all day to get it.

223
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,070
If you think
you can just...

224
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,905
Just... what?

225
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,408
It's for the children.

226
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,243
They're hungry.

227
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,162
We are all hungry.

228
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,664
KIRA:
That's right, we are.

229
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:35,333
And hunger can make people
do stupid things.

230
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,959
Like what you're
doing now.

231
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,461
Cardassians are the enemy.

232
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,171
We shouldn't be
fighting amongst ourselves.

233
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,382
We should be trying
to help each other.

234
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,551
That's what we<i> were</i> doing...
helping ourselves to some soup.

235
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,928
Hey, you want soup,
you go stand in line
like everyone else.

236
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,181
We may have to take orders
from the spoonheads

237
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,684
but we<i> don't</i> have
to take them from<i> you!</i>

238
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,268
(<i> shouts</i> )

239
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,953
Oh, thank you.

240
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,081
I wish we could repay
your kindness somehow,

241
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,457
but we have so little food.

242
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,710
That's all right;
I'm not hungry.

243
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,003
Can't remember the last time
I met a Bajoran

244
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,922
who wasn't hungry.

245
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,716
I'm Kira Meru.

246
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:27,260
I'm...

247
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,387
just glad I could help.

248
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,971
And this is my husband,

249
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,266
Taban, my son, Reon,

250
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,603
my son, Pohl,
and my daughter, Nerys.

251
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,067
They're beautiful.

252
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,569
NERYS:
Mommy. Mommy.

253
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,863
What is it, honey?
What is it?

254
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,072
What? Tell me.

255
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,407
(<i> Nerys whispering</i> )

256
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,245
She wants to know
what your name is.

257
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,540
Me?

258
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,507
I'm Luma Rahl.

259
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,845
It's nice to
meet you, Nerys.

260
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,474

The new Cardassian
Ore Processing Center

orbiting Bajor is
nearing completion.

263
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,814
The Cardassian troops
stationed there

264
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:23,483
will require
"comfort women"

265
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:27,069
to make their tour of duty
less... stressful.

266
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,155
Her.

267
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,698

No!

CHILD:
No!

269
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,577
From now on, you'll
receive extra rations

270
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,329
of food and medicine...

Gul Dukat.

273
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,208
No!

274
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,753
And her.

275
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,509
But my children...

276
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,887
Your children will
eat better than they
have any right to.

277

Meru!

I love you!

Ladies, can I have
your attention, please?

286

You will find food
in your quarters.

Eat as much as you want...

288
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,694
and make sure you get
a good night's rest.

289
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:52,655
You'll want
to look your best tomorrow.

Oh, and feel free to linger
as long as you want

value cleanliness.

but don't give
up just yet.

to get out of here.

How?

299
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,475
There must be a

on the station.

301
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,728
We'll contact them.

They'll help
us get away.

We could live on
this for a year.

Easy. Easy.

315
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,470
You don't want
to make yourself sick.

316
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,181
Sick?
From too much food?

317
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,767
That would be a change.

were here.

The Cardassians said they
would take care of them,

so maybe they will.

322
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,168
Don't count on it.

323
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,587
We need to find a way
to get off this station.

324
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,214
Once we do,
we'll figure out a way

325

to free your family.

326
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,426
Then what?

327
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,594
We'll hide in the hills.

328
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,138
We'll join the resistance.

329
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,431
I suppose that's possible.

330
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,684
<i>Of course</i> it is.

331
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,811
Till then, we'll just
need to bide our...

00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,817
I'm sorry.

00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,489
I failed to show
a Cardassian soldier

334
00:19:58,489 --> 00:19:59,866
the proper respect.

335
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:05,412
We all have scars
of one kind or another.

336
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,165
Maybe...

337
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,625
but most aren't
quite so evident.

338
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,055
It's not so bad.

339
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,810
Why do you keep doing that?

340
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:31,605
What?

Helping me.

342
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:38,404
First, at the refugee
center and now here.

343
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,158
I don't have many friends.

344
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,119
Well...

345
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,789
you have one now.

346
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,004
Well done.

347
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,757
I can hardly believe
you're the same women

348
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,593
I met yesterday.

349
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:04,222
In fact, you're not.

350
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:06,724
Your old lives
have ended.

351
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:10,019
Your pasts
have been erased.

352
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:14,314
You have one purpose
and one purpose only--

353
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,316
to provide
comfort and care

354
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,736
to the Cardassian officers
stationed here.

355
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:24,700
Do that well,
and you'll want for nothing.

356
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,577
Fail and you
and your family

357
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,662
will be sent
to a labor camp.

358
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,331
Now, remember,
ladies...

359
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,126
you're all easily replaceable.

360
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:35,461
Make one mistake
and I won't hesitate to...

361
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:36,503
Basso!

362
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:38,839
That's enough.

363
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:46,346
Welcome...

364
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,058
to Terok Nor.

365
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:52,061
I hope your stay here
will be a pleasant one.

366
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,981
I assure you, I will do
everything possible

367
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:57,524
to make it so.

368
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:01,612
I suspect that many of you
must be feeling a bit...

369
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,572
uneasy right now.

370
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:07,910
I'm well aware that among
the Bajoran population,

371
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,830
there is a perception
that all Cardassians

372
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,917
are to be feared,
that we are a cruel

373
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,919
and heartless people.

374
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,172
I hope to change that--

375
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,966
not with words,
but with actions--

376
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:25,719
in the hope that you<i> will</i> come
to appreciate

377
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,430
the better part of our nature.

378
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,975
I assure you...

379
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:33,602
we<i> are</i> capable
of great kindness.

380
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,438
What of our families?
Are they all right?

381
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,649
Who said you could speak?!
Guards!

382
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,109
Stay where you are.

383
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:48,575
Your families...

384
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:51,954
will be<i> well</i> taken care of.

385
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:55,249
That, I promise you.

386
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,591
What is this?

387
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,886
I...

388
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,971
Basso...

389
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,472
Forgive me, Prefect.

390
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,308
I... didn't notice
the imperfection.

391
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,101
I'll have her
removed at once.

392
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,644
Get me a dermal regenerator.

393
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,313
But...
<i>Now.</i>

394
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,068
I'm afraid to ask

395
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:24,070
how you came
by such a mark.

396
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,654
It's nothing.

397
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,157
On the contrary.

398
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:31,327
It's an unfortunate reminder
of the gulf

399
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,495
that exists
between our two peoples.

400
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:38,458
It must be removed...
immediately.

401
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:42,171
Just relax.

402
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,881
It's all right.

403
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:48,510
(<i> whispering</i> ):
Relax.

404
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:57,395
There.

405
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,358
Beautiful.

406
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:07,696
Carry on.

407
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:14,745
Well, I'd say congratulations
are in order.

408
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:17,497
You've all passed
your first test.

409
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:33,431
(<i> buzz of conversation</i> )

410
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:35,099
Sit down and drink with me.

411
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,477
(<i> laughing</i> )

412
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,319
Mind telling me what
you're smiling about?

413
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,988
The Prophets.

414
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,031
I never realized they had
such a sense of humor.

415
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,992
When I was a child,

416
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,453
I dreamed of having
enough food to eat,

417
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:58,372
and pretty clothes to wear,
and now look at me.

418
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:01,875
I have everything I ever wanted,
and I feel horrible.

419
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,003
That<i> is</i> pretty funny
in a horrible way.

420
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:09,175
I suppose
if I can survive starvation,

421
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:10,801
I can survive this.

422
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,971
After all, we Bajorans
can survive anything.

423
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,141
MALE:
You.

424
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:19,101
Think you can
stand there

425
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,395
hiding in a
corner all night?

426
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,445
I don't remember
seeing<i> you</i> before.

427
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,738
I just arrived yesterday.

428
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,657
And I bet I know
what you're thinking.

429
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,202
You'd like nothing better
than to get us all drunk

430
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:38,371
so you could kill
us in our sleep.

431
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:40,206
Are you sure
you're not part Betazoid?

432
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,581
(<i> laughing</i> )

433
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:42,916
Come.

434
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,836
Sit on my lap...

435
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:49,715
and tell me how
much you hate

436
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,967
Cardassians.

437
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,679
You Bajoran women,
you're all so bony.

438
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,265
That's because you Cardassians
eat all our food.

439
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,351
(<i> chuckling</i> )

440
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:02,353
You know, I could
have you executed

441
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:04,271
for that kind
of insolence.

442
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,606
And that's one of the reasons
we hate you so much.

443
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,608
(<i> laughing</i> )

444
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,610
Clever girl.

445
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,821
Now, pour me
some more of that<i> kanar,</i>

446
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,741
and let's see if
we can't work out
our differences.

447
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:16,867
(<i> door opening</i> )

448
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,049
Let her go.

449
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:37,221
I<i> said</i> let her go.

450
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:38,638
All I said
to her was...

451
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,349
I don't care
what you were saying.

452
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,976
I don't like what
you were doing.

453
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,145
Now get away
from her.

454
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,192
Are you all right?

455
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,238
Basso...

456
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:57,199
escort this woman
back to her quarters,

457
00:26:57,199 --> 00:27:00,202
and see that her privacy
is respected.

458
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,371
BASSO:
She will not
be disturbed.

459
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:03,581
I only hope

460
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:04,998
you won't
condemn us all

461
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:08,001
for the boorish behavior
of one man.

462
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,714
I only hope
you won't condemn us all

463
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,716
for the boorish
behavior

464
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,718
of one man.

465
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:24,810
(<i> door opens</i> )

466
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,521
How did you know
he was going to say that?

467
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:31,525
Let's just say this is not
the first performance I've seen

468
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:35,112
of this little... melodrama.

469
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:38,031
That woman should
consider herself
fortunate.

470
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,493
She's caught the Prefect's eye.

471
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:44,037
As of now, she's off limits
to the rest of us.

472
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,247
As for you...

473
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:47,082
I know.

474
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:50,210
I know-- more<i> kanar.</i>

475
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,545
(<i> chuckling</i> )

476
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:56,550
(<i> door opens</i> )

477
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:02,848
(<i> drunken laughter</i> )

478
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,433
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

479
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,059
Now, one foot in
front of another.

480
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,894
Don't tell me
what to do.

481
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:10,564
I'll put my feet
wherever I want.

482
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:11,815
I'm a Cardassian.

483
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,192
Whatever you say.

484
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,402
Just try not to stumble
out of any airlocks

485
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,945
on your way home.

486
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,114
I'm not going home;
I'm coming in with you.

487
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,908
No, you're not.
You're going
back to your quarters

488
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,327
and you're going to sleep.

489
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:26,205
I want comfort,
and I want it now.

490
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,290
You<i> are</i> a comfort
woman, aren't you?

491
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,875
You're dressed like one.

492
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,502
Oh, don't let appearances
fool you.

493
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:32,961
Mm. That mouth of yours

494
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,172
is going to get you
in trouble someday.

495
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:38,758
Now, let's go get
some... sleep.

496
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:39,843
(<i> laughing</i> )

497
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,720
I have a better idea.

498
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,055
You go sleep
in your quarters.

499
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,516
I'll sleep in mine,
and tomorrow...

500
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:49,687
Tomorrow, you'll be all mine
to do with as I please.

501
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:51,188
Oh, I can hardly wait.

502
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,360
(<i> sighs</i> )

503
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,070
Meru, I'm back.

504
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:01,156
I'm going to have
to shower for a week

505
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,616
to get the smell
of that Legate off of me.

506
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:05,077
I'll be sure
to tell him
you said that.

507
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:07,663
What are you
doing here?
Where's Meru?

508
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,415
Looks like you're going
to have these quarters

509
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,250
all to yourself, at least
for a little while.

510
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,626
I said where's Meru?

511
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:14,503
She's moving up
in the world.

512
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:17,089
Your friend must have hidden
talents I wasn't aware of.

513
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,049
Our beloved Prefect
has invited her

514
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:20,509
to share his quarters.

515
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:21,843
I want to see her.

516
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,095
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
Do you?

517
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,888
I said take me to her!

518
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:25,931
Hey!

519
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,601
(<i> grunting</i> )

520
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:33,272
(<i> groaning</i> )

521
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,823
So tell me,
how's work going

522
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,617
on the ore
processing center?

523
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:28,076
You ought to join
the work detail sometime--

524
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,161
find out for yourself.

525
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,537
All in good time.

526
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,164
Once the center's
up and running

527
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,166
we'll all be slaving
away down there.

528
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,841
I have news for you.

529
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,802
About my friend?

530
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:46,345
I know why you haven't
heard from her

531
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:47,554
in the last few weeks.

532
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,222
She hasn't been
on the station.

533
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,349
What are you
talking about?

534
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,559
Word has it
she's been off

535
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,270
on a little vacation
with Gul Dukat.

536
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,314
They just got back today.

537
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:00,192
Why is that woman
so important to you?

538
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,360
She's nothing
but a collaborator.

539
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,445
She is not a collaborator.

540
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:06,156
She's a comfort woman
for the spoonheads, isn't she?

541
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,575
Mm-hmm. So was I.

542
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,369
For a day.

543
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,331
But I've been watching you.

544
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:16,750
You have no love
for the spoonheads.

545
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,085
Neither does my friend.
Look, I told you already.

546
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,338
I don't want to join
your resistance cell.

547
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:22,548
Just leave me alone.

548
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:23,841
I will.

549
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:27,260
I promise.

550
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,388
But first, I need for you
to draw a map for me.

551
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,766
A map of what?

552
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:33,933
The Cardy side
of the station.

553
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:34,976
Well, like you said,

554
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,812
I was only
there one day.

555
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:39,189
Well, anything
you remember will help--

556
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:41,274
quarters, corridors,
meeting rooms.

557
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,610
Why? What are you planning?

558
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,362
It doesn't concern you.

559
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:49,575
Are you going
to help us or not?

560
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,118
BASSO:
You.

561
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,328
Follow me.

562
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,224
You may enter.

563
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:22,023
Luma.

564
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:26,695
Oh! Are you all right?

565
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,447
I've been worried
about you

566
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,948
since the night
they took you.

567
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,157
I know.

568
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,743
I wanted to get
a message to you.

569
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:34,787
Has he hurt you?

570
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:36,496
Who?

571
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,081
Dukat.

572
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,584
Hurt me?

573
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:41,585
No.

574
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,503
He hasn't hurt me.

575
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,716
I, I wish I knew
how to explain to you

576
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:49,426
these past few weeks...

577
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:51,428
make you understand.

578
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:53,346
Understand what?

579
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,348
DUKAT:
That I'm not

580
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,893
the monster you think I am.

581
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:00,646
You see?

582
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:02,230
I told you

583
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,149
I'd find a big
enough vase.

584
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,611
What do you think?

585
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:09,404
They're beautiful.

586
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,823
(<i> chuckling</i> )

587
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,411
I don't think
your friend

588
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,163
approves of
the flowers.

589
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,998
Or of me.

590
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,877
Meru...

591
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:26,004
are you sure
this is the woman

592
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,256
you want as
your companion?

593
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,091
Yes.

594
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,135
As you wish.

595
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:38,600
The fact is...

596
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,437
I've treated Meru
with nothing but kindness

597
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,105
and consideration.

598
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,232
If you don't
believe me,

599
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,567
ask her.

600
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:54,449
I'll be back
as soon as this meeting
is finished.

601
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,672
It's true.

602
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:11,008
He's very different

603
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:12,509
from what
I expected.

604
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,513
Don't let that smile
fool you.

605
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:17,723
He's still the enemy.

606
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:20,183
It's not that simple.

607
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,060
Yes.

608
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,436
It is.

609
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:28,233
Meru... listen to me.

610
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:31,277
While you're in here
playing parlor games,

611
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:33,780
he's busy carrying out
the extermination of our people.

612
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,657
That's not true.

613
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,450
He's written to
Central Command

614
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,411
urging them to rethink
their policy towards Bajor.

615
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:42,622
I don't care
if he played you
a holo-recording

616
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:43,957
of him on his hand and knees

617
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,709
begging Central Command
to end the occupation.

618
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,920
It would still be a lie!

619
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,421
Like that first night
when he saved you

620
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:50,923
from that Gul--
that wasn't real.

621
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:53,341
He set the whole thing up
to win you over.

622
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,093
He told me.

623
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,178
He tells me everything.

624
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,388
You just don't know him.

625
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:00,682
I don't<i> need</i> to know him.

626
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:03,435
I know the things he's done.

627
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,812
Look what he did to you.

628
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,356
He took you away
from your family--

629
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,775
from your children.

630
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:11,526
He's promised to help them.

631
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,071
He's going to send them food
and medical supplies.

632
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:16,573
That still
doesn't make it right.

633
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:18,658
What about your husband?

634
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,994
Taban loves you.

635
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:23,663
How can you forget him
so quickly?

636
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,876
I have not forgotten him.

637
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,211
What do you
expect me to do?

638
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:33,006
Kick and bite Dukat every
time he comes near me?

639
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:36,509
How is that going to help
Taban or the children?

640
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,886
Oh, is that what
you tell yourself--

641
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,512
that you're doing it
for the children,

642
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,014
the clothes, the food,
the easy living--

643
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,682
that you're doing
it all for them?

644
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,642
Are you<i> that</i> deluded?

645
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,310
It's not for them.

646
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,812
It's for you.

647
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:49,314
You like it here.

648
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:52,067
You enjoy playing house
with that murderer.

649
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,527
Don't you see what you are?

650
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,905
What you've allowed
yourself to become?

651
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:59,157
You're a collaborator.

652
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,784
A collaborator?

653
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,619
Because I share Dukat's bed?

654
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,203
No, because you<i> like</i>
sharing his bed--

655
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,914
because you've fallen
in love with him!

656
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,583
Where are you going?

657
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,793
Back where I belong.

658
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,427
It's composed
of ultritium resin,

659
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,804
which means it's doubtful

660
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,764
that the Cardassian
sensors will pick it up.

661
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,766
Of course, there's
always a chance.

662
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,935
You let me
worry about that.

663
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:29,395
You sound like you've
done this before.

664
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,356
You'd be surprised.

665
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:32,565
Remember--

666
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,942
the bomb is set to go off

667
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:35,986
three minutes
after it's activated.

668
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:40,115
And once it's activated,
it cannot be disarmed.

669
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:42,951
So make sure
you have enough
time to get away.

670
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:45,620
How large of a blast radius
are we talking about?

671
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,664
20 meters.

672
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:50,542
I suggest you plant it
somewhere in Dukat's quarters.

673
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:53,294
I'll pick the right spot for it.

674
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,630
What about
that Bajoran mistress of his?

675
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,215
What about her?

676
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,551
You cannot risk telling her
what you're doing...

677
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:03,180
not even to save her life.

678
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,183
Why would I do that?

679
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:08,768
Like you said,
she's a collaborator.

680
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,858
She deserves whatever she gets.

681
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:33,085
I'm beginning to find
you very tiresome.

682
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:34,961
Yeah, I don't like
you much either.

683
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,880
Now, I need you
to take me to Kira Meru.

684
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,548
(<i> scoffs</i> ):
I have better things to do

685
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:41,259
than to shuttle you
around this station.

686
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,137
It's time you decided which side
of this gate you want to be on.

687
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:45,638
I have.

688
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:49,226
Now, take me to Kira
so that I can apologize to her.

689
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:51,477
Guard.

690
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,147
A wise decision.

691
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,886
(<i> chuckles</i> )

692
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:29,682
(<i> Meru and Dukat chuckling</i> )

693
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,939
I didn't expect
to see you again.

694
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:39,109
I came because I
owe you an apology.

695
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:41,611
The things I said,
they were unfair.

696
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:44,072
I'd like us to
be friends again.

697
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:46,158
So would I.

698
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:50,453
Whatever makes
you happy, my dear.

699
00:38:57,169 --> 00:38:58,628
Can I get you something?

700
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:01,131
Maybe later.
All right.

701
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:03,216
First thing we do is get you
some new quarters,

702
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:04,550
something close by.

703
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,844
Sounds good.

704
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,137
I have a copy

705
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:09,181
of that transmission
you requested.

706
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:10,849
Ah, thank you, Basso.

707
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:11,850
That'll be all.

708
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,893
What about<i> her?</i>

709
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:18,273
Don't concern
yourself with Luma.

710
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:20,192
She's not going
to cause us

711
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:22,068
any more trouble,
are you?

712
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,569
That's not what
I'm here for.

713
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:24,946
No, it isn't.

714
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,074
Well, Basso,
you heard--

715
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,284
find her some
new quarters.

716
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:30,409
Right away.

717
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:34,331
This is for you.

718
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:37,667
I think you'll find it
very interesting.

719
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:40,378
I'll be in my study
if you need me.

720
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:03,776
I'll see to my quarters.

721
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,153
Okay, Luma.

722
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:11,743
Meru, I hope the Cardassians
aren't lying to me

723
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:14,495
and that they really
will send this message to you.

724
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,581
I know it's only
been a few weeks

725
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,209
that we've been back home,
but you should see the children.

726
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:21,669
It's like they've been
transformed.

727
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,964
Reon and Pohl are laughing
and playing together.

728
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,799
They've never been happier.

729
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:30,511
And I swear, little Nerys
must have gained five pounds.

730
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,514
Of course,
they keep asking for you.

731
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:36,768
I've told them that you're
still at the refugee center.

732
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,645
I think that's best,
at least for the time being.

733
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,566
I can't believe
how much I miss you.

734
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:46,236
I think about you all the time.

735
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:49,614
You've saved all our lives.

736
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,866
I hope you realize that.

737
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,535
Never forget it,
not even for an instant.

738
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:57,622
Every day,
I pray to the Prophets

739
00:40:57,622 --> 00:41:01,793
that you'll find some peace
in this new life of yours.

740
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:05,713
I believe that even
in the worst of times,

741
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,007
we can still find moments

742
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,801
of joy and kindness.

743
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,636
If you can find

744
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:14,389
that kindness, hold on to it.

745
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:17,850
And remember, no matter
what happens...

746
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,478
I love you, Meru.

747
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,481
I'll always love you.

748
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,484
(<i> sobbing</i> )

749
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,279
Come on, we've got
to get out of here.

750
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:30,405
Why?

751
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:31,864
Dukat, get out here, now!
Go!

752
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,074
What?

753
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,034
There's a bomb.
Meru!

754
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,455
Get out of the way!

755
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,004
(<i> groans</i> )

756
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,130
Meru...

757
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,840
Meru.

758
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,347
(<i> panting</i> )

759
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,726
(<i> gasps</i> )

760
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,951
I've always hated
collaborators.

761
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,787
I mean, what could be worse
than betraying your own people?

762
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:23,375
During the occupation,
if I ever had any doubt

763
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:24,667
about what their
fate should be,

764
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,919
I would think
of my mother--

765
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,463
how she gave her
life for Bajor.

766
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:30,382
She was a hero.

767
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:31,757
They were traitors.

768
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,176
It was that simple.

769
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:35,845
Or so I thought.

770
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,517
She did what she had to do
to save her family...

771
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:41,934
to save you.

772
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,270
It doesn't make it right.

773
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,730
Maybe not,

774
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,691
but it was<i> her</i> decision to make.

775
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:55,073
(<i> sighs</i> )

776
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,741
I did some checking.

777
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:59,785
She died in a
Cardassian hospital

778
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:02,955
seven years after she
met Dukat-- seven years.

779
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,957
Do you know how
many Bajorans

780
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,335
died in the labor camps
during that time--

781
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:12,631
<i>died--</i> while my mother sat
sipping<i> kanar</i> with Dukat?

782
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:21,266
Tell me something, Nerys.

783
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:25,603
If you hate her that much,
why did you save her life?

784
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,855
Believe me...

785
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:33,361
there's a part of me
that wishes that I hadn't.

786
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,909
But the fact is...

787
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,872
no matter what she did...

788
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,961
she was still my mother.
