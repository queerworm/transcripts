1
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:18,473
Resistance is futile.

2
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:24,651
You will disarm your weapons
and escort us to Sector 001.

3
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:29,864
If you attempt to intervene,
we will destroy you.

4
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:31,237
Red Alert.

5
00:00:31,274 --> 00:00:34,247
Load all torpedo bays,
ready phasers.

6
00:00:34,281 --> 00:00:36,548
Move us to position alpha,
Ensign.

7
00:00:48,279 --> 00:00:49,805
They've locked on.

8
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,943
Reroute auxiliary power.

9
00:01:00,173 --> 00:01:02,701
Our shields are being drained!

10
00:01:02,745 --> 00:01:04,544
64 percent...

11
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:05,882
42...

12
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,118
Recalibrate shield nutation.

13
00:01:08,158 --> 00:01:11,393
Modulation is having no effect.

14
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:13,027
Shields have failed!

15
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:14,037
Full reverse.

16
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:17,342
Maintain all!

17
00:01:32,681 --> 00:01:34,241
Damage report.

18
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:39,627
Damage report!

19
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,293
Warning. Damage to warp core.

20
00:01:42,337 --> 00:01:44,638
Containment failure
in five minutes.

21
00:01:47,348 --> 00:01:48,647
Direct hit...

22
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:50,618
decks one through four...

23
00:01:53,095 --> 00:01:55,795
Let's get the civilians
to the escape pods, Lieutenant.

24
00:01:55,834 --> 00:01:56,824
Aye, sir.

25
00:02:03,051 --> 00:02:05,956
Leave everything.

26
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:07,790
Get to your assigned
evacuation area now!

27
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,127
Warning. Damage to warp core.

28
00:02:09,165 --> 00:02:10,759
Containment failure
in four minutes.

29
00:02:10,802 --> 00:02:11,827
Dora!

30
00:02:11,871 --> 00:02:14,639
I'll take care of her.
You go on.

31
00:02:14,678 --> 00:02:15,977
Have you seen Jennifer?

32
00:02:29,913 --> 00:02:32,647
Jennifer?!

33
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:33,881
Jake!

34
00:02:33,922 --> 00:02:35,893
Warning. Damage to warp core.

35
00:02:35,926 --> 00:02:38,489
Containment failure
in three minutes.

36
00:02:44,613 --> 00:02:46,446
I'm going to get your mom.

37
00:02:46,484 --> 00:02:48,351
You're going to be okay.

38
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:51,957
Jennifer!

39
00:02:51,996 --> 00:02:53,295
Okay, Jake.

40
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:57,035
We'll get your mom out,
and we'll get out of here.

41
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:00,409
Commander!

42
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:01,941
Help me!

43
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:15,847
Jennifer... hold on.

44
00:03:17,054 --> 00:03:19,082
Sir...

45
00:03:19,126 --> 00:03:20,527
Just help me to get her free!

46
00:03:20,562 --> 00:03:21,530
She's gone.

47
00:03:21,565 --> 00:03:23,000
There's nothing we can do.

48
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:24,527
We have to leave!

49
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:28,542
Warning. Damage to warp core.

50
00:03:28,581 --> 00:03:30,916
Containment failure
in two minutes.

51
00:03:30,953 --> 00:03:32,388
Ensign, take the boy.

52
00:03:32,423 --> 00:03:33,413
Aye, sir.

53
00:03:35,764 --> 00:03:37,563
We've got to go now, sir.

54
00:03:37,602 --> 00:03:38,764
Damn it!

55
00:03:38,804 --> 00:03:41,743
We just can't leave her here!

56
00:03:41,778 --> 00:03:45,218
Oh! Oh, no!

57
00:03:57,981 --> 00:04:00,452
Jake, Jake, you're okay.

58
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:08,396
Stand by to launch.

59
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,806
Ready.

60
00:04:37,064 --> 00:04:38,727
Jake.

61
00:04:38,768 --> 00:04:40,966
There you are.

62
00:04:41,007 --> 00:04:42,476
How are they biting?

63
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,275
Small-fries.
Threw them back.

64
00:04:44,314 --> 00:04:45,647
Want to go for a swim?

65
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:47,347
Don't have time.
We have to get ready.

66
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:49,916
It won't be so bad.

67
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,694
I've heard that Bajor
is a beautiful world.

68
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:54,566
So why can't we
live on the planet

69
00:04:54,604 --> 00:04:56,575
instead of some
old space station?

70
00:04:56,609 --> 00:04:58,910
The station is
in orbit of Bajor.

71
00:04:58,948 --> 00:05:01,317
It will be just like shore duty.

72
00:05:01,353 --> 00:05:03,916
Will there be kids there?

73
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,259
Absolutely!

74
00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:06,320
Lots of kids.

75
00:05:06,365 --> 00:05:07,925
Bridge to Sisko.

76
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:09,131
Yes, Captain?

77
00:05:09,238 --> 00:05:11,938
We're approaching
Deep Space 9, Commander.

78
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,006
We'll be docking
in seven minutes.

79
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:15,382
Acknowledged.

80
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,526
Come on.

81
00:05:23,604 --> 00:05:25,005
What do you say?

82
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,376
We'll take the pond with us.

83
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,912
Computer, end program.

84
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,074
Is that it?

85
00:07:54,886 --> 00:07:56,651
Commence Station Log,
Deep Space 9

86
00:07:56,689 --> 00:08:00,255
Commander Benjamin Sisko,
Stardate 46388.2.

87
00:08:00,298 --> 00:08:03,032
At the request of the Bajoran
provisional government

88
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,801
Starfleet has agreed
to establish

89
00:08:04,841 --> 00:08:06,778
a Federation presence
in this system

90
00:08:06,812 --> 00:08:08,111
following the withdrawal

91
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:10,450
of the Cardassian
occupational forces.

92
00:08:10,488 --> 00:08:12,287
The first contingent of officers

93
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:14,863
including my Chief
of Operations, Miles O'Brien

94
00:08:14,898 --> 00:08:17,461
arrived two days ago
on the <i>Enterprise.</i>

95
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:31,802
I'm told the Cardassians
decided to have some fun

96
00:08:31,837 --> 00:08:32,964
the day they left.

97
00:08:33,006 --> 00:08:37,107
Four Bajorans were killed
trying to protect their shops.

98
00:08:37,148 --> 00:08:39,176
Why hasn't anybody
cleaned this up?

99
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,689
We've got
all available personnel

100
00:08:40,724 --> 00:08:43,492
assigned to repairing
primary systems, sir.

101
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,503
The Cardassians took
every component of value.

102
00:08:46,537 --> 00:08:48,508
We're virtually defenseless.

103
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,238
I discussed this
with Major Kira

104
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:52,806
the attaché assigned here by
the Bajoran government and...

105
00:08:52,852 --> 00:08:54,789
Understood.

106
00:08:57,094 --> 00:08:59,794
What about the civilians
who operated these shops?

107
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:01,667
A lot of them lost
everything they had.

108
00:09:01,705 --> 00:09:03,334
A few are trying to rebuild

109
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:05,573
but most are
packing up to leave.

110
00:09:12,229 --> 00:09:15,066
Welcome, Commander.

111
00:09:15,103 --> 00:09:16,333
Please enter.

112
00:09:16,372 --> 00:09:18,205
The Prophets await you.

113
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:22,181
Another time, perhaps.

114
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,987
Another time.

115
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,291
When my wife Keiko
saw our quarters

116
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,733
she started talking
about visiting her mother

117
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:44,759
in Kumomoto.

118
00:09:44,804 --> 00:09:48,209
Sir, I wouldn't allow
the boy to go roaming.

119
00:09:48,246 --> 00:09:50,308
We're still having
some security problems.

120
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,448
Dad, there is nothing
to sleep on in there

121
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:55,256
except for a cushion
on the floor.

122
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:57,162
Well, we can get
you a real bunk

123
00:09:57,199 --> 00:09:58,361
off the <i>Enterprise.</i>

124
00:09:58,402 --> 00:10:00,065
I almost forgot.

125
00:10:00,106 --> 00:10:02,634
Captain Picard wants to see you
as soon as possible.

126
00:10:02,678 --> 00:10:04,079
He does?

127
00:10:04,115 --> 00:10:07,384
Any word on our science
and medical officers yet?

128
00:10:07,423 --> 00:10:09,485
They're expected tomorrow.

129
00:10:09,561 --> 00:10:11,794
Jake, I want you to stay here

130
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,598
till I come back.

131
00:10:13,637 --> 00:10:16,405
Is this the food replicator?

132
00:10:16,443 --> 00:10:17,969
I'm afraid they're all off-line.

133
00:10:18,013 --> 00:10:19,812
There's plenty
of emergency rations.

134
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,048
I could send some down.

135
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,989
Dad...

136
00:10:27,936 --> 00:10:30,237
We're going to have to rough it

137
00:10:30,275 --> 00:10:33,510
until we get things
up and running, Jake, okay?

138
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,985
Okay.

139
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:38,424
"Okay."

140
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,973
I'd like to ask the designer

141
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,481
what he was thinking about
when they built this place.

142
00:11:02,516 --> 00:11:05,978
I still haven't been able
to find an ODN access.

143
00:11:06,024 --> 00:11:08,257
That's the Prefect's
office up there.

144
00:11:08,296 --> 00:11:11,701
So all others have
to look up with respect.

145
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,536
Cardassian architecture.

146
00:11:13,575 --> 00:11:14,543
Yes, sir.

147
00:11:14,577 --> 00:11:16,707
Major Kira's been using it.

148
00:11:16,749 --> 00:11:21,021
Is it my imagination
or is it unusually warm?

149
00:11:21,058 --> 00:11:24,829
The environmental controls
in Ops are stuck at 32 C.

150
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:26,461
We're working on it.

151
00:11:32,853 --> 00:11:35,621
I guess it's time
to meet Major Kira.

152
00:11:35,658 --> 00:11:39,224
Sir, have you ever served
with any Bajoran women?

153
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:40,736
No. Why?

154
00:11:40,771 --> 00:11:42,901
I was just wondering, sir.

155
00:11:42,942 --> 00:11:45,345
They've become meaningless.

156
00:11:45,381 --> 00:11:47,818
I just don't agree, Kira.

157
00:11:47,853 --> 00:11:49,983
You are throwing it all away.

158
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:51,494
All of you!

159
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:53,123
You're being a fool!

160
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,763
Well, then don't ask
my opinion next time.

161
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,069
Yes?

162
00:11:59,113 --> 00:12:01,084
I'm Benjamin Sisko.

163
00:12:01,117 --> 00:12:03,247
I suppose you want the office.

164
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,954
Well, I thought
I'd say hello first

165
00:12:05,995 --> 00:12:07,259
and then take the office

166
00:12:07,298 --> 00:12:09,633
but we could do it
in any order you'd like.

167
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:12,534
Hello.

168
00:12:12,577 --> 00:12:15,880
Is something bothering you,
Major?

169
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:17,511
You don't want to ask me that,
Commander.

170
00:12:17,555 --> 00:12:18,545
Why not?

171
00:12:18,591 --> 00:12:20,585
Because I have the bad habit
of telling the truth

172
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:23,192
even when people
don't want to hear it.

173
00:12:23,235 --> 00:12:25,570
Perhaps I want to hear it.

174
00:12:27,812 --> 00:12:31,810
I don't believe the Federation
has any business being here.

175
00:12:31,854 --> 00:12:33,687
The provisional government
disagrees with you.

176
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,291
The provisional government and I
don't agree on a lot of things

177
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,200
which is probably
why they sent me

178
00:12:39,238 --> 00:12:40,730
to this godforsaken place.

179
00:12:42,746 --> 00:12:45,719
I have been fighting
for Bajoran independence

180
00:12:45,753 --> 00:12:48,590
since I was old enough
to pick up a phaser.

181
00:12:48,626 --> 00:12:50,688
We finally drive
the Cardassians out

182
00:12:50,731 --> 00:12:52,291
and what do our new leaders do?

183
00:12:52,335 --> 00:12:55,365
They call up the Federation
and invite them right in!

184
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:57,311
The Federation
is only here to help...

185
00:12:57,346 --> 00:12:59,043
...Help us.
Yes, I know.

186
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:03,355
The Cardassians said
the same thing 60 years ago.

187
00:13:03,393 --> 00:13:04,885
Major, when I was ordered here

188
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,458
I requested a Bajoran national
as my First Officer.

189
00:13:07,502 --> 00:13:08,937
It made sense.

190
00:13:08,973 --> 00:13:11,001
It still does, at least to me.

191
00:13:11,044 --> 00:13:14,449
Now, you and I are going to have
to find some way to...

192
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,128
Yes, Major?

193
00:13:19,163 --> 00:13:21,931
Odo, are you reading something
at A-14?

194
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,031
My security array
has been down for two hours.

195
00:13:24,074 --> 00:13:25,475
I'll meet you there.

196
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:30,052
We've been having
a lot of break-ins lately.

197
00:13:30,088 --> 00:13:32,822
No need for you
to come along, Commander.

198
00:13:41,047 --> 00:13:42,539
Hurry up!

199
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:47,523
Now!

200
00:13:49,366 --> 00:13:50,528
Now!

201
00:14:01,894 --> 00:14:04,890
All right!
Just stand where you are!

202
00:14:08,008 --> 00:14:09,341
Hold it!

203
00:14:27,553 --> 00:14:28,817
That's enough!

204
00:14:28,856 --> 00:14:30,450
Who the hell are you?

205
00:14:30,493 --> 00:14:33,364
Odo, this is our new
Starfleet Commander.

206
00:14:39,915 --> 00:14:42,443
I don't allow weapons
on the Promenade.

207
00:14:42,488 --> 00:14:43,957
That includes phasers.

208
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:45,153
Nog?

209
00:14:45,194 --> 00:14:46,686
What's going on?

210
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:52,540
The boy's in a lot of trouble.

211
00:14:52,578 --> 00:14:56,884
Commander, my name is Quark.

212
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,918
I used to run the local
gambling establishment.

213
00:15:00,964 --> 00:15:04,530
This is my brother's boy.

214
00:15:07,378 --> 00:15:09,177
Surely, you can see
he has only...

215
00:15:09,215 --> 00:15:11,243
a peripheral involvement
in all this.

216
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:13,656
We're scheduled
to depart tomorrow.

217
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:17,833
If we could be permitted
to take him

218
00:15:17,869 --> 00:15:19,395
I promise you,
he will be severely...

219
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:21,033
That won't be possible.

220
00:15:21,076 --> 00:15:22,978
Take him to the brig.

221
00:15:31,066 --> 00:15:33,003
Quark probably
sent the two of them here

222
00:15:33,037 --> 00:15:35,908
to steal the ore samples
in the first place.

223
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,574
Major, there's a
Ferengi legal tradition.

224
00:15:38,617 --> 00:15:40,416
It's called plea bargaining.

225
00:15:40,454 --> 00:15:41,821
I might let the boy go

226
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,921
but I want something
in exchange from Mr. Quark...

227
00:15:44,998 --> 00:15:46,627
something very important.

228
00:15:46,668 --> 00:15:48,935
O'Brien to Commander Sisko.

229
00:15:49,007 --> 00:15:50,134
Go ahead.

230
00:15:50,177 --> 00:15:52,808
Sir, the <i>Enterprise</i>
hailed us again.

231
00:15:52,849 --> 00:15:55,651
Captain Picard
is waiting to see you.

232
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:57,318
Acknowledged.

233
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,193
This won't take long.

234
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:15,488
Come.

235
00:16:15,526 --> 00:16:18,795
Commander, yes, please come in.

236
00:16:21,372 --> 00:16:22,671
Welcome to Bajor.

237
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:25,043
It's been a long time, Captain.

238
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,247
Have we met before?

239
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:31,693
Yes, sir.
We met in battle.

240
00:16:31,729 --> 00:16:35,295
I was on the <i>Saratoga</i>
at Wolf 359.

241
00:16:42,253 --> 00:16:46,126
I assume
that you have been briefed

242
00:16:46,162 --> 00:16:50,400
on the events leading
to the Cardassian withdrawal.

243
00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:51,908
Yes, sir.

244
00:16:51,942 --> 00:16:55,245
I understand they spent
the last half century

245
00:16:55,283 --> 00:16:57,686
robbing the planet
of every valuable resource

246
00:16:57,722 --> 00:16:58,986
before abandoning it.

247
00:16:59,025 --> 00:17:00,688
They've left the Bajorans

248
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:03,861
without a means
of being self-sustaining.

249
00:17:03,903 --> 00:17:06,568
The relief efforts
we've been coordinating

250
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,910
are barely adequate.

251
00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:12,984
I...

252
00:17:13,024 --> 00:17:16,590
I've come to know the Bajorans.

253
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:21,469
I'm... a strong proponent

254
00:17:21,576 --> 00:17:23,341
for their entry
into the Federation.

255
00:17:23,381 --> 00:17:24,975
Is it going to happen?

256
00:17:25,018 --> 00:17:26,578
Not easily.

257
00:17:26,622 --> 00:17:29,185
The ruling parties are
at each other's throats.

258
00:17:29,227 --> 00:17:31,255
Factions that were united
against the Cardassians

259
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:32,426
have resumed old conflicts.

260
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,498
Sounds like they're not ready.

261
00:17:35,575 --> 00:17:37,773
Your job is to do everything

262
00:17:37,814 --> 00:17:40,115
short of violating
the Prime Directive

263
00:17:40,152 --> 00:17:41,985
to make sure that they are.

264
00:17:48,338 --> 00:17:49,898
I have been...

265
00:17:49,942 --> 00:17:51,970
made aware by Starfleet

266
00:17:52,014 --> 00:17:55,887
of your objections
to this assignment.

267
00:17:55,922 --> 00:17:58,827
I... I would have thought

268
00:17:58,863 --> 00:18:02,395
that after three years spent
at the Utopia Planitia Yards

269
00:18:02,437 --> 00:18:04,339
that you would be
ready for a change.

270
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,468
I have a son

271
00:18:05,511 --> 00:18:07,607
that I'm raising alone, Captain.

272
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:10,086
This is not
the ideal environment.

273
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:11,954
Unfortunately,
as Starfleet officers

274
00:18:11,993 --> 00:18:14,123
we do not always have the luxury

275
00:18:14,165 --> 00:18:16,534
to serve
in an ideal environment.

276
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:17,765
I realize that, sir

277
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:20,039
and I'm investigating
the possibility

278
00:18:20,078 --> 00:18:22,743
of returning to Earth
for civilian service.

279
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:26,826
Then perhaps Starfleet Command

280
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,562
should be considering
a replacement for you.

281
00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:32,697
That's probably a good idea.

282
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,677
I'll look into it.

283
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:36,340
In the meantime, however...

284
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:39,354
In the meantime,
I will do the job

285
00:18:39,388 --> 00:18:43,329
I've been ordered to do
to the best of my ability, sir.

286
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:48,743
Dismissed.

287
00:19:05,248 --> 00:19:07,013
It's really quite simple, Quark.

288
00:19:07,052 --> 00:19:08,521
You're not going to leave.

289
00:19:08,556 --> 00:19:10,493
Not going to leave?

290
00:19:10,527 --> 00:19:13,398
But we're packed
and ready to go.

291
00:19:13,434 --> 00:19:14,869
Unpack.

292
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,603
I don't understand, Commander.

293
00:19:17,643 --> 00:19:19,807
Why would you want me to stay?

294
00:19:19,848 --> 00:19:21,374
I'm curious myself.

295
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:24,449
The man is a gambler
and a thief.

296
00:19:24,492 --> 00:19:26,223
I'm not a thief.

297
00:19:26,263 --> 00:19:27,755
You are a thief.

298
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,069
If I am, you haven't
been able to prove it

299
00:19:31,107 --> 00:19:32,406
for four years.

300
00:19:32,444 --> 00:19:33,743
Please.

301
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,751
My officers,
the Bajoran engineers

302
00:19:35,785 --> 00:19:37,118
all their families

303
00:19:37,154 --> 00:19:40,093
depend on the shops
and services of this Promenade.

304
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:42,429
If people like you abandon it

305
00:19:42,467 --> 00:19:45,770
this is going to become
a ghost town.

306
00:19:45,808 --> 00:19:48,781
We need someone
to step forward and say

307
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:51,787
"I'm staying.
I'm rebuilding."

308
00:19:51,821 --> 00:19:54,190
We need a community leader

309
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:57,462
and it's going to be...
you, Quark.

310
00:19:59,506 --> 00:20:01,477
Community leader.

311
00:20:01,511 --> 00:20:03,310
Seems reasonable.

312
00:20:03,348 --> 00:20:06,982
You have all the character
references of a politician.

313
00:20:07,023 --> 00:20:11,557
How could I possibly
operate my establishment

314
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,698
under Starfleet
rules of conduct?

315
00:20:14,741 --> 00:20:17,008
This is still a Bajoran station.

316
00:20:17,046 --> 00:20:19,347
We're just here to administrate.

317
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,014
You run honest games

318
00:20:21,055 --> 00:20:23,892
you won't have any problems
from me.

319
00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:27,529
Commander, I've made a career
out of knowing when to leave

320
00:20:27,571 --> 00:20:29,872
and this Bajoran
provisional government

321
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:33,543
is far too provisional
for my taste

322
00:20:33,585 --> 00:20:36,056
and when governments fall

323
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:40,590
people like me
are lined up and shot.

324
00:20:40,634 --> 00:20:42,605
There is that risk...

325
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:48,543
but, then,
you are a gambler, Quark.

326
00:20:48,585 --> 00:20:50,145
And a thief.

327
00:20:50,189 --> 00:20:52,752
You know, Quark, that poor boy

328
00:20:52,796 --> 00:20:54,926
is about to spend
the best years of his life

329
00:20:54,966 --> 00:20:56,765
in a Bajoran prison.

330
00:20:59,745 --> 00:21:01,716
I'm a father myself.

331
00:21:01,749 --> 00:21:06,989
I know what your brother
must be going through.

332
00:21:07,028 --> 00:21:09,728
The boy should be
with his family

333
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,705
not in some cold jail cell.

334
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:13,800
Think about it.

335
00:21:13,844 --> 00:21:16,111
It's up to you.

336
00:21:21,528 --> 00:21:23,590
You know, at first

337
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:28,099
I didn't think
I was going to like him.

338
00:21:40,337 --> 00:21:42,170
Major?

339
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:48,884
Everyone else is busy
repairing the primary systems.

340
00:21:48,957 --> 00:21:51,258
I suppose Starfleet officers

341
00:21:51,296 --> 00:21:54,633
aren't used to getting
their hands dirty.

342
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:09,300
In the refugee camps

343
00:22:09,338 --> 00:22:11,866
we learned to do
whatever needed to be done.

344
00:22:11,943 --> 00:22:13,572
Didn't matter who you were.

345
00:22:17,189 --> 00:22:21,153
I was just talking
with our good neighbor, Quark.

346
00:22:21,198 --> 00:22:22,360
He's laying odds

347
00:22:22,401 --> 00:22:24,998
that the government's
going to fall.

348
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,502
Quark knows a good bet
when he hears one.

349
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:31,521
This government
will be gone in a week

350
00:22:31,555 --> 00:22:33,184
and so will you.

351
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,527
What happens to Bajor then?

352
00:22:35,564 --> 00:22:37,227
Civil war.

353
00:22:40,743 --> 00:22:43,044
You think it's inevitable?

354
00:22:43,082 --> 00:22:46,385
The only one who can prevent it
is Opaka.

355
00:22:46,423 --> 00:22:48,394
Opaka?

356
00:22:48,428 --> 00:22:50,057
Our spiritual leader.

357
00:22:50,098 --> 00:22:53,094
She's known as the Kai.

358
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:55,967
Our religion

359
00:22:56,045 --> 00:22:59,348
is the only thing that
holds my people together.

360
00:22:59,386 --> 00:23:02,086
If she would call
for unity, they'd listen.

361
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:05,064
Leaders of all the factions
have tried to get to her

362
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:06,534
but she lives in seclusion

363
00:23:06,569 --> 00:23:08,471
rarely sees anyone.

364
00:23:10,478 --> 00:23:12,608
Commander...

365
00:23:12,649 --> 00:23:15,417
it is time.

366
00:24:11,464 --> 00:24:15,770
I apologize for the condition
in which we greet you.

367
00:24:15,808 --> 00:24:17,277
The Cardassians?

368
00:24:17,311 --> 00:24:20,182
Your arrival has been
greatly anticipated.

369
00:24:24,327 --> 00:24:28,200
Have you ever explored
your <i>pagh,</i> Commander?

370
00:24:28,236 --> 00:24:30,138
<i>Pagh?</i>

371
00:24:30,175 --> 00:24:33,980
A Bajoran draws courage
from his spiritual life.

372
00:24:34,017 --> 00:24:36,580
Our life-force...

373
00:24:38,861 --> 00:24:41,834
our <i>pagh...</i>

374
00:24:41,868 --> 00:24:44,864
is replenished by the Prophets.

375
00:24:44,908 --> 00:24:46,377
Breathe.

376
00:24:47,514 --> 00:24:50,214
Kai Opaka,
if we could discuss...

377
00:24:50,254 --> 00:24:51,723
Breathe!

378
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:59,164
Ironic.

379
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:06,749
One who does not wish to be
among us is to be the Emissary.

380
00:25:08,295 --> 00:25:10,197
Please, come with me.

381
00:25:31,315 --> 00:25:33,878
You are correct that Bajor
is in great jeopardy

382
00:25:33,921 --> 00:25:36,256
but it is the threat
to our spiritual life

383
00:25:36,293 --> 00:25:37,785
that far outweighs any other.

384
00:25:37,897 --> 00:25:40,460
Perhaps, but I am powerless
until...

385
00:25:40,502 --> 00:25:41,732
Commander.

386
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,425
I cannot give you
what you deny yourself.

387
00:25:51,461 --> 00:25:53,158
I'm sorry?

388
00:25:53,199 --> 00:25:56,536
Look for solutions
from within, Commander.

389
00:25:56,573 --> 00:25:58,908
Come with me.

390
00:26:06,094 --> 00:26:08,088
What is it?

391
00:26:09,503 --> 00:26:11,497
The Tear of the Prophet.

392
00:26:22,198 --> 00:26:24,499
What the hell?

393
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:29,406
Opaka?

394
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:35,423
Ah... ow!

395
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,969
Ah... ow!

396
00:26:40,005 --> 00:26:41,201
Hey!

397
00:26:41,242 --> 00:26:43,976
I'm sorry.
It's just that this...

398
00:26:44,015 --> 00:26:45,416
Jen?

399
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:46,784
Yes?

400
00:26:46,821 --> 00:26:48,758
Jennifer?

401
00:26:48,793 --> 00:26:49,989
I'm sorry.

402
00:26:50,028 --> 00:26:53,195
Did we meet last night
at George's party?

403
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,103
George?

404
00:26:57,479 --> 00:26:59,142
Jennifer...

405
00:27:01,321 --> 00:27:03,292
Wait a minute.

406
00:27:03,326 --> 00:27:05,159
This is impossible.

407
00:27:05,197 --> 00:27:07,099
Are you okay?

408
00:27:07,135 --> 00:27:08,434
I know this place.

409
00:27:08,471 --> 00:27:10,704
This is Gilgo Beach,
where we met.

410
00:27:10,743 --> 00:27:12,873
We met here before?

411
00:27:12,948 --> 00:27:18,052
I was carrying
three lemonades...

412
00:27:18,093 --> 00:27:20,496
The sand was burning my feet

413
00:27:20,532 --> 00:27:24,998
and I stopped here... to...

414
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,342
Ow!

415
00:27:27,682 --> 00:27:31,521
Do you realize
how incredible this is?

416
00:27:33,161 --> 00:27:35,724
No, of course you don't.

417
00:27:41,113 --> 00:27:43,346
Jennifer...

418
00:27:45,055 --> 00:27:48,028
have a lemonade.

419
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:56,673
I'm afraid I don't accept drinks
from strange men on the beach.

420
00:28:10,747 --> 00:28:13,218
So tell me the truth.

421
00:28:13,253 --> 00:28:16,556
Have we really met before?

422
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:18,188
No.

423
00:28:20,437 --> 00:28:23,410
Then how do you know my name?

424
00:28:23,444 --> 00:28:25,415
I... uh...

425
00:28:25,448 --> 00:28:26,815
George told me

426
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:29,084
at the party.

427
00:28:29,123 --> 00:28:32,757
Are you going
to tell me your name?

428
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:34,427
Oh, Ben Sisko.

429
00:28:34,469 --> 00:28:37,100
I just graduated
from Starfleet Academy.

430
00:28:37,141 --> 00:28:39,772
I'm waiting
for my first posting.

431
00:28:39,814 --> 00:28:42,445
Oh, a junior officer.

432
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:44,458
Yeah.

433
00:28:44,492 --> 00:28:46,121
My mother warned me

434
00:28:46,162 --> 00:28:48,463
to watch out
for junior officers.

435
00:28:48,501 --> 00:28:51,804
Your mother is
going to adore me.

436
00:28:51,841 --> 00:28:54,814
You're awfully sure of yourself.

437
00:28:54,848 --> 00:28:56,750
It's not every day

438
00:28:56,787 --> 00:29:00,124
you meet the girl
you're going to marry.

439
00:29:01,464 --> 00:29:05,428
Do you use this routine
a lot with women?

440
00:29:05,473 --> 00:29:09,642
No, never before,
and never again.

441
00:29:12,824 --> 00:29:15,125
Sure.

442
00:29:15,162 --> 00:29:16,631
How about letting me

443
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:18,796
cook dinner for you tonight?

444
00:29:18,838 --> 00:29:21,811
My father was a gourmet chef.

445
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:27,187
I will make for you
his famous aubergine stew.

446
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:29,056
I don't know.

447
00:29:29,161 --> 00:29:31,826
You're supposed to say, "Yes!"

448
00:29:31,867 --> 00:29:35,204
I'll probably be sorry.

449
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:42,279
Jennifer!

450
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:58,717
Nine Orbs, like this one,
have appeared in the skies

451
00:29:58,762 --> 00:30:01,393
over the past 10,000 years.

452
00:30:01,435 --> 00:30:03,736
The Cardassians
took the others.

453
00:30:03,774 --> 00:30:06,405
You must find
the Celestial Temple

454
00:30:06,446 --> 00:30:07,915
before they do.

455
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,510
The Celestial Temple?

456
00:30:09,553 --> 00:30:13,255
Tradition says the Orbs
were sent by the Prophets

457
00:30:13,295 --> 00:30:14,594
to teach us.

458
00:30:14,632 --> 00:30:18,266
What we have learned
has shaped our theology.

459
00:30:18,307 --> 00:30:23,946
The Cardassians will do anything
to decipher their powers.

460
00:30:23,987 --> 00:30:27,449
If they discover
the Celestial Temple

461
00:30:27,495 --> 00:30:29,124
they could destroy it.

462
00:30:29,165 --> 00:30:34,165
What makes you think
I can find your temple?

463
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:42,219
This will help you.

464
00:30:42,262 --> 00:30:44,324
Kai Opaka...

465
00:30:44,367 --> 00:30:45,734
I can't unite my people

466
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:48,264
till I know the Prophets
have been warned.

467
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:52,509
You will find the Temple...

468
00:30:52,552 --> 00:30:56,014
not for Bajor,
not for the Federation

469
00:30:56,061 --> 00:30:57,963
but for your own <i>pagh.</i>

470
00:30:57,998 --> 00:31:00,265
It is quite simply, Commander

471
00:31:00,336 --> 00:31:03,741
the journey you have
always been destined to take.

472
00:31:23,521 --> 00:31:25,252
What?

473
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,365
I was just thinking...

474
00:31:30,404 --> 00:31:33,343
how much you look like your mom.

475
00:31:39,291 --> 00:31:41,228
Kira to Sisko.

476
00:31:41,262 --> 00:31:42,561
Go ahead.

477
00:31:42,598 --> 00:31:44,865
Sorry to disturb you,
Commander

478
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:48,401
but there's something on the
Promenade you might want to see.

479
00:31:48,446 --> 00:31:49,779
On my way.

480
00:32:26,533 --> 00:32:28,504
Step up, step up.

481
00:32:28,538 --> 00:32:31,443
Fortune's fates
are with you today, friends.

482
00:32:32,513 --> 00:32:33,812
Dabo!

483
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:36,151
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

484
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:38,159
That's fine.

485
00:32:38,192 --> 00:32:40,425
I'll be right back.

486
00:32:52,526 --> 00:32:54,497
What will you have, Commander?

487
00:32:54,531 --> 00:32:56,091
How's the local synthale?

488
00:32:56,134 --> 00:32:58,105
You won't like it.

489
00:32:58,138 --> 00:33:00,838
I love the Bajorans.

490
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:03,908
Such a deeply spiritual culture

491
00:33:03,952 --> 00:33:06,948
but they make a dreadful ale.

492
00:33:06,993 --> 00:33:11,561
Never trust ale
from a god-fearing people

493
00:33:11,603 --> 00:33:13,300
or a Starfleet Commander

494
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,711
that has one
of your relatives in jail.

495
00:33:20,156 --> 00:33:21,489
Dabo!

496
00:33:23,798 --> 00:33:27,933
Station Log, Stardate 46390.1.

497
00:33:27,974 --> 00:33:30,343
The <i>Enterprise</i> has been ordered
to the Lapolis system.

498
00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:32,543
They're scheduled to depart
at 0500 hours

499
00:33:32,584 --> 00:33:35,112
after off-loading
three runabout-class vessels.

500
00:33:35,157 --> 00:33:37,685
Meanwhile, our medical
and science officers

501
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,862
are arriving,
and I'm looking forward

502
00:33:40,904 --> 00:33:43,307
to a reunion
with a very old friend.

503
00:33:43,342 --> 00:33:44,401
Commander, if you'd like me

504
00:33:44,445 --> 00:33:45,937
to give them a tour
of the station...

505
00:33:45,981 --> 00:33:47,382
You and Dr. Bashir go ahead.

506
00:33:47,418 --> 00:33:48,614
I'm afraid I have to put

507
00:33:48,655 --> 00:33:50,352
Lieutenant Dax
to work right away.

508
00:33:50,392 --> 00:33:52,294
Jadzia...

509
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,765
uh...

510
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:56,395
maybe we could...

511
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:59,173
get together later for dinner...

512
00:33:59,213 --> 00:34:02,584
or... or... or...
or a... or a drink?

513
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,385
I'd be delighted.

514
00:34:06,897 --> 00:34:09,665
He's a little young
for you, isn't he?

515
00:34:09,703 --> 00:34:11,674
He's 27. I'm 28.

516
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:13,337
328, maybe.

517
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:16,681
Did you tell him about
that slug inside of you?

518
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,018
Yes, Benjamin.

519
00:34:18,055 --> 00:34:19,524
He knows I'm a Trill.

520
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,028
He finds it fascinating.

521
00:34:21,062 --> 00:34:23,363
He's never met
a joined species before.

522
00:34:23,401 --> 00:34:25,895
I wonder if he'd
been as fascinated

523
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,877
if you still looked
the way you did

524
00:34:27,912 --> 00:34:29,313
the last time I saw you.

525
00:34:29,348 --> 00:34:30,647
Perhaps not.

526
00:34:30,684 --> 00:34:31,983
Whew.

527
00:34:32,021 --> 00:34:35,587
This is going to take
some getting used to.

528
00:34:35,629 --> 00:34:36,928
Don't be ridiculous.

529
00:34:36,966 --> 00:34:38,937
I'm still the same old Dax...

530
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:40,303
more or less.

531
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:46,082
I'm afraid we've had
some security problems.

532
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:49,456
Looks like looters
got in here.

533
00:34:49,494 --> 00:34:51,795
Oh, this will be perfect.

534
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:53,827
Real...

535
00:34:53,871 --> 00:34:56,571
frontier medicine.

536
00:34:56,611 --> 00:34:58,844
Frontier medicine?

537
00:34:58,916 --> 00:35:03,325
Major, I had my choice
of any job in the fleet.

538
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,659
Did you?

539
00:35:04,696 --> 00:35:06,758
I didn't want some cushy job

540
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,326
or a research grant.

541
00:35:08,371 --> 00:35:09,670
I wanted this...

542
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:12,076
the farthest reaches
of the galaxy.

543
00:35:12,113 --> 00:35:14,813
One of the most remote
outposts available.

544
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,289
This is where the adventure is.

545
00:35:17,325 --> 00:35:19,694
This is where heroes are made.

546
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:24,639
Right here,
in the wilderness.

547
00:35:24,675 --> 00:35:28,446
This "wilderness" is my home.

548
00:35:28,483 --> 00:35:29,975
Well, I-I-I didn't mean...

549
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,546
The Cardassians left behind

550
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,492
a lot of injured people,
Doctor.

551
00:35:33,529 --> 00:35:34,828
You can make yourself useful

552
00:35:34,865 --> 00:35:36,528
by bringing
your Federation medicine

553
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:37,696
to the natives.

554
00:35:37,738 --> 00:35:41,235
Oh, you'll find them
a friendly, simple folk.

555
00:35:49,366 --> 00:35:51,268
We do have one advantage.

556
00:35:51,303 --> 00:35:54,765
The monks have been studying
these things for 10,000 years.

557
00:35:54,811 --> 00:35:56,178
I've had our computers set up

558
00:35:56,214 --> 00:35:58,447
to interface with their
historical data banks.

559
00:35:58,486 --> 00:36:00,319
That should give us something.

560
00:36:00,357 --> 00:36:01,986
Soon as possible, Dax.

561
00:36:02,028 --> 00:36:04,226
The eight other Orbs

562
00:36:04,266 --> 00:36:06,635
are probably in some
Cardassian laboratory

563
00:36:06,671 --> 00:36:10,042
being turned upside down
and inside out.

564
00:36:12,384 --> 00:36:13,546
Benjamin...

565
00:36:13,587 --> 00:36:15,147
I was happy when I heard

566
00:36:15,191 --> 00:36:16,888
you accepted this assignment.

567
00:36:16,928 --> 00:36:19,058
I'd been worried about you.

568
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,540
It's good to see you, too...
old man.

569
00:36:26,216 --> 00:36:29,121
Computer, create a data base

570
00:36:29,156 --> 00:36:31,924
for all historical references
to the Orbs

571
00:36:31,963 --> 00:36:33,262
including all reports

572
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,068
of any unexplained phenomena
in Bajoran space.

573
00:36:36,106 --> 00:36:37,405
Time parameters?

574
00:36:37,442 --> 00:36:39,413
Ten millennia.

575
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,814
Initializing data base.

576
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:45,452
Requested function will require
two hours to complete.

577
00:37:08,781 --> 00:37:10,080
Curzon.

578
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:39,011
The Captain's
in the ready room, Chief.

579
00:38:39,055 --> 00:38:42,028
Should I tell him you're here?

580
00:38:42,062 --> 00:38:43,361
Oh, that's okay.

581
00:38:43,398 --> 00:38:44,731
Thanks.

582
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:00,804
Transport me
to the Ops pad, Maggie.

583
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,171
Yes, sir.

584
00:39:06,084 --> 00:39:07,383
Mr. O'Brien?

585
00:39:07,421 --> 00:39:10,792
I understand that I just
missed you on the Bridge.

586
00:39:10,828 --> 00:39:12,263
Yes, sir.

587
00:39:12,298 --> 00:39:17,298
I... I didn't want
to disturb you, sir.

588
00:39:17,343 --> 00:39:19,040
Ensign.

589
00:39:20,884 --> 00:39:24,051
This is your favorite
transporter room, isn't it?

590
00:39:24,092 --> 00:39:27,554
Number three, yes, sir.

591
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,698
You know, yesterday
I called down here

592
00:39:30,741 --> 00:39:33,144
and I asked for you
without thinking.

593
00:39:35,752 --> 00:39:38,019
It won't be quite the same.

594
00:39:38,057 --> 00:39:41,519
It's just
a transporter room, sir.

595
00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:48,546
Permission to disembark,
Captain.

596
00:39:48,581 --> 00:39:51,109
Permission granted.

597
00:39:58,471 --> 00:40:00,270
Energize.

598
00:40:29,308 --> 00:40:31,711
Message coming in
from their Commander

599
00:40:31,814 --> 00:40:32,976
Gul Dukat.

600
00:40:33,017 --> 00:40:34,509
Dukat.

601
00:40:34,554 --> 00:40:37,686
He used to be the Cardassian
Prefect of Bajor.

602
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:41,669
He's requesting permission
to come aboard to greet us.

603
00:40:41,703 --> 00:40:45,508
Surely a coincidence
that the <i>Enterprise</i> just left.

604
00:40:45,545 --> 00:40:47,641
Mr. O'Brien

605
00:40:47,684 --> 00:40:51,284
tell Gul Dukat
I look forward to meeting him.

606
00:40:57,674 --> 00:40:59,303
Good day, Commander.

607
00:41:02,484 --> 00:41:04,478
Gul Dukat.

608
00:41:04,523 --> 00:41:07,291
Excuse my presumption

609
00:41:07,329 --> 00:41:13,469
but... this was my office
only two weeks ago.

610
00:41:14,512 --> 00:41:19,387
I'm not used to being
on this side of the desk.

611
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:25,463
I'll be honest with you,
Commander.

612
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:28,602
I miss this office.

613
00:41:28,644 --> 00:41:31,515
I was not happy to leave it.

614
00:41:31,551 --> 00:41:33,282
Drop by any time

615
00:41:33,322 --> 00:41:34,916
you're feeling homesick.

616
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:37,796
You are very gracious.

617
00:41:37,899 --> 00:41:41,806
And allow me to assure
you that we only want

618
00:41:41,908 --> 00:41:45,815
to be helpful
in this difficult transition.

619
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:48,789
You're far
from the Federation fleet

620
00:41:48,824 --> 00:41:51,558
alone in this remote outpost

621
00:41:51,597 --> 00:41:54,468
with poor defense systems.

622
00:41:54,504 --> 00:41:57,841
Your Cardassian neighbors
will be quick to respond

623
00:41:57,878 --> 00:42:00,578
to any problems you might have.

624
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:03,489
We'll try to keep the dog
off your lawn.

625
00:42:05,128 --> 00:42:11,598
So... tell me,
what did you think of Kai Opaka?

626
00:42:11,643 --> 00:42:15,584
I know you went
to the surface to see her.

627
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:18,820
I understand
you brought back an Orb.

628
00:42:18,926 --> 00:42:21,329
We thought we had all of them.

629
00:42:21,365 --> 00:42:25,831
Perhaps we could have
an exchange of information...

630
00:42:25,942 --> 00:42:28,038
pool our resources.

631
00:42:31,556 --> 00:42:34,552
I don't know anything
about an Orb.

632
00:42:36,567 --> 00:42:38,970
We will be in close proximity

633
00:42:39,006 --> 00:42:41,877
should you wish
to reconsider my suggestion.

634
00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:43,448
In the meantime

635
00:42:43,483 --> 00:42:46,888
I assume you have no objection
to my men

636
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:49,589
enjoying the hospitality
of the Promenade.

637
00:42:53,807 --> 00:42:55,835
Commander.

638
00:43:09,142 --> 00:43:11,773
What do you know
about the Denorios Belt?

639
00:43:11,815 --> 00:43:13,682
Your basic charged
plasma field...

640
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:16,692
no one gets anywhere near it
unless they have to.

641
00:43:16,726 --> 00:43:19,699
In the 22nd century,
a ship carrying Kai Taluno

642
00:43:19,733 --> 00:43:22,706
was disabled for several
days in the Denorios Belt

643
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,904
where he claims
he had a vision.

644
00:43:25,012 --> 00:43:26,641
Let me guess.

645
00:43:26,682 --> 00:43:29,313
He saw the Celestial Temple
of the Prophets.

646
00:43:29,355 --> 00:43:30,654
Not quite.

647
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,322
But he did say
that the heavens opened up

648
00:43:33,364 --> 00:43:35,335
and nearly swallowed his ship.

649
00:43:35,369 --> 00:43:38,672
Are we reduced to chasing
metaphors to solve this?

650
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:40,339
That's not all.

651
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:44,344
At least five of the Orbs
were found in the Denorios Belt.

652
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:48,627
There were also 23 navigational
reports over the years

653
00:43:48,666 --> 00:43:52,266
of unusually severe
neutrino disturbances

654
00:43:52,308 --> 00:43:54,175
in the same area.

655
00:43:54,212 --> 00:43:56,980
I've correlated
all these reports

656
00:43:57,019 --> 00:43:59,115
into one analysis grid.

657
00:43:59,156 --> 00:44:01,491
Our Celestial Temple?

658
00:44:01,529 --> 00:44:03,932
Worth a look...

659
00:44:03,968 --> 00:44:08,137
but we've got Cardassians
on our back doorstep.

660
00:44:08,177 --> 00:44:10,774
We need to get by them
undetected.

661
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:42,017
May we have
your attention please.

662
00:44:42,122 --> 00:44:44,924
This establishment
is being closed.

663
00:44:44,962 --> 00:44:46,933
What do you mean?

664
00:44:46,967 --> 00:44:48,869
You can't do this.

665
00:44:48,904 --> 00:44:50,875
If you have a problem, sir

666
00:44:50,909 --> 00:44:53,882
you'll have to take it up
with Commander Sisko.

667
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:55,783
I intend to.

668
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:58,121
This is outrageous.

669
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:03,094
Friends, my apologies.

670
00:45:04,273 --> 00:45:10,151
A minor misunderstanding
that will be rectified shortly.

671
00:45:12,291 --> 00:45:15,788
Give them something
to put their winnings into.

672
00:45:41,224 --> 00:45:45,063
Because we were winning
too much, of course.

673
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:48,505
Leave it to Starfleet
to ruin a fine day.

674
00:46:50,856 --> 00:46:52,450
<i>Rio Grande</i> to Ops.

675
00:46:52,493 --> 00:46:54,589
Initializing prelaunch systems.

676
00:46:54,631 --> 00:46:55,895
Confirmed, <i>Rio Grande.</i>

677
00:47:11,503 --> 00:47:14,168
Scanners are picking up
fluctuations

678
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:17,581
in the Cardassian's
energy distribution net.

679
00:47:21,861 --> 00:47:24,196
Their computers are crashing.

680
00:47:24,233 --> 00:47:26,204
Shields and sensors are down.

681
00:47:26,237 --> 00:47:27,672
Odo's done it.

682
00:47:27,707 --> 00:47:29,336
Ops to <i>Rio Grande.</i>

683
00:47:29,378 --> 00:47:30,813
You're in business.

684
00:47:30,915 --> 00:47:32,782
Beginning launch sequence.

685
00:47:41,406 --> 00:47:43,377
Odo's reached
the transport site.

686
00:47:43,411 --> 00:47:44,971
Trying to lock on.

687
00:47:49,858 --> 00:47:53,663
I've never done this
with a Cardassian transporter.

688
00:47:55,371 --> 00:47:57,808
Damn it, what's the problem?

689
00:48:05,795 --> 00:48:07,594
Nice work, Constable.

690
00:48:24,137 --> 00:48:26,267
Approaching grid perimeter.

691
00:48:26,308 --> 00:48:28,871
Slowing
to one-quarter impulse.

692
00:48:28,982 --> 00:48:33,185
Computer, give me visual,
bearing 23 mark 217.

693
00:48:33,224 --> 00:48:36,493
Range... 3,100 kilometers.

694
00:48:36,533 --> 00:48:39,802
Sensors are picking up
unusually high proton counts.

695
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,574
Setting a new course
to those coordinates.

696
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:50,295
All external wave intensities
are increasing rapidly

697
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:52,631
but checking...

698
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:55,335
Confirmed. There is no
corresponding increase

699
00:48:55,375 --> 00:48:56,674
inside the cabin.

700
00:48:56,712 --> 00:48:58,910
How is that possible?

701
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,535
Sensors are not functioning.

702
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:10,007
We've lost all contact
with the space station.

703
00:49:11,613 --> 00:49:14,381
Scanners are reading
major subspace disruption

704
00:49:14,419 --> 00:49:16,447
at their last known coordinates.

705
00:49:17,627 --> 00:49:20,429
What the hell is happening
out there?

706
00:49:20,467 --> 00:49:22,300
I don't know.

707
00:49:23,874 --> 00:49:26,243
They're just gone.

708
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:34,691
Are your navigational readings
going crazy?

709
00:49:34,732 --> 00:49:36,429
I'll recalibrate
when I have a moment.

710
00:49:36,469 --> 00:49:38,336
Take your time.

711
00:49:45,724 --> 00:49:47,991
Can you get a fix
on our coordinates?

712
00:49:48,096 --> 00:49:49,326
There is a star

713
00:49:49,366 --> 00:49:51,894
just under
five light years away.

714
00:49:51,938 --> 00:49:53,771
No M-Class planets.

715
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:56,578
Computer, identify
closest star system.

716
00:49:56,617 --> 00:49:58,986
Idran... a ternary system

717
00:49:59,022 --> 00:50:01,016
consisting
of twin O-type companions.

718
00:50:01,126 --> 00:50:02,686
Idran?
That can't be right.

719
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:04,256
Computer,
basis of identification?

720
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:07,035
Idran is based
on the analysis conducted

721
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,541
in the 22nd century

722
00:50:08,577 --> 00:50:11,607
by the Quadros-1 probe
of the Gamma Quadrant.

723
00:50:11,651 --> 00:50:14,783
The Gamma Quadrant?!
70,000 light years from Bajor?

724
00:50:14,824 --> 00:50:17,318
I'd say we just found our way
into a wormhole.

725
00:50:17,363 --> 00:50:19,300
It's not like any wormhole
I've ever seen.

726
00:50:19,335 --> 00:50:21,932
There were none
of the usual resonance waves.

727
00:50:21,974 --> 00:50:23,466
Could this be how the Orbs

728
00:50:23,511 --> 00:50:25,846
found their way
into the Bajoran system?

729
00:50:25,884 --> 00:50:28,914
Not an unreasonable hypothesis.

730
00:50:28,957 --> 00:50:30,084
If it's true

731
00:50:30,126 --> 00:50:33,828
that would mean that this
has been here for 10,000 years.

732
00:50:33,868 --> 00:50:35,770
Dax, we might
have just discovered

733
00:50:35,806 --> 00:50:37,241
the first stable wormhole

734
00:50:37,276 --> 00:50:38,609
known to exist.

735
00:50:38,646 --> 00:50:40,913
Bring us about, Lieutenant.

736
00:50:48,802 --> 00:50:51,035
I'm modifying the flight
program to compensate

737
00:50:51,074 --> 00:50:52,600
for the spatial
discontinuities.

738
00:50:52,644 --> 00:50:54,581
We should have
a smoother ride this time.

739
00:50:58,258 --> 00:51:00,491
Did you reduce impulse power?

740
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:02,090
No. Why?

741
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,194
We're losing velocity.

742
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:12,389
Forward velocity
down to 80 kph.

743
00:51:12,424 --> 00:51:14,827
Warning.
Impulse system overload.

744
00:51:14,862 --> 00:51:17,129
Auto shutdown in 12 seconds.

745
00:51:17,234 --> 00:51:18,897
Disengaging engines.

746
00:51:18,938 --> 00:51:22,470
Velocity at 20 kph.

747
00:51:24,184 --> 00:51:26,678
I'm picking up atmosphere.

748
00:51:28,026 --> 00:51:30,327
Inside a wormhole?

749
00:51:30,364 --> 00:51:33,029
Capable of supporting life.

750
00:51:37,214 --> 00:51:39,447
We've just landed.

751
00:51:39,486 --> 00:51:41,855
On what?

752
00:52:23,086 --> 00:52:24,919
It's beautiful.

753
00:52:25,925 --> 00:52:28,226
You have a strange
eye for beauty, Dax.

754
00:52:28,264 --> 00:52:30,063
You don't think this is one

755
00:52:30,102 --> 00:52:32,733
of the most idyllic settings
you've ever seen?

756
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:35,041
We are standing on a rock face.

757
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:38,247
Do you see the storms?

758
00:52:38,287 --> 00:52:41,488
It's as clear as a summer's day.

759
00:52:43,532 --> 00:52:45,434
You see it, too?

760
00:52:45,471 --> 00:52:46,963
Yes.

761
00:52:59,503 --> 00:53:01,474
Low-level ionic pattern.

762
00:53:01,508 --> 00:53:02,977
It's probing us.

763
00:53:03,011 --> 00:53:06,348
Someone's idea
of shaking hands maybe.

764
00:53:16,108 --> 00:53:18,272
I am Commander Benjamin Sisko

765
00:53:18,379 --> 00:53:21,010
of the United Federation
of Planets.

766
00:53:38,208 --> 00:53:39,198
Dax!

767
00:54:28,591 --> 00:54:30,994
Another neutrino disruption.

768
00:54:31,029 --> 00:54:33,330
Scanners are
picking up an object

769
00:54:33,368 --> 00:54:35,839
near their last
known coordinates.

770
00:54:35,874 --> 00:54:38,004
It isn't a ship.

771
00:54:38,045 --> 00:54:40,516
Major, there's something
inside it...

772
00:54:40,551 --> 00:54:42,522
some kind of life-form.

773
00:54:42,556 --> 00:54:45,427
Are the Cardassian
sensors picking it up?

774
00:54:45,463 --> 00:54:46,932
They should be
back on line by now.

775
00:54:46,966 --> 00:54:49,460
We have to assume they
know everything we know.

776
00:54:49,505 --> 00:54:51,533
Yellow Alert.
Secure Ops.

777
00:54:51,576 --> 00:54:53,706
Beam it aboard, Mr. O'Brien

778
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:56,721
but put it in a level-1
security field.

779
00:54:56,755 --> 00:54:59,557
Aye, sir.
Locking on.

780
00:55:24,953 --> 00:55:27,083
Who are you?

781
00:55:31,101 --> 00:55:33,231
Who are you?!

782
00:55:33,273 --> 00:55:35,244
It is corporeal!

783
00:55:35,277 --> 00:55:37,248
A physical entity.

784
00:55:37,315 --> 00:55:39,080
What?

785
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:41,113
What did you say?

786
00:55:41,157 --> 00:55:44,426
It is responding
to visual and auditory stimuli.

787
00:55:44,464 --> 00:55:46,435
Linguistic communication.

788
00:55:46,469 --> 00:55:48,940
Yes, linguistic communication.

789
00:55:48,975 --> 00:55:52,142
Are you capable
of communicating with me?

790
00:55:55,489 --> 00:55:57,585
What... are you?

791
00:55:57,628 --> 00:56:00,465
My species is known as human.

792
00:56:00,501 --> 00:56:03,998
I come from a planet
called Earth.

793
00:56:04,043 --> 00:56:05,376
Earth?

794
00:56:05,412 --> 00:56:09,148
This is what my planet
looks like.

795
00:56:09,188 --> 00:56:13,654
You and I
are very different species.

796
00:56:13,698 --> 00:56:16,671
It will take... time

797
00:56:16,705 --> 00:56:19,268
for us to understand
one another.

798
00:56:19,378 --> 00:56:24,652
What is this... time?

799
00:56:34,579 --> 00:56:38,817
First Officer's Log,
Stardate 46392.7.

800
00:56:38,856 --> 00:56:40,793
We're preparing to launch
a rescue mission

801
00:56:40,827 --> 00:56:42,456
to find Commander Sisko.

802
00:56:42,498 --> 00:56:45,232
But first, our navigational
sensors must be recalibrated

803
00:56:45,271 --> 00:56:48,472
to work under the conditions
reported by Lieutenant Dax.

804
00:56:48,511 --> 00:56:51,484
It is no ordinary wormhole.

805
00:56:51,518 --> 00:56:53,682
My analysis suggests

806
00:56:53,723 --> 00:56:57,163
that it isn't
even a natural phenomenon.

807
00:56:57,199 --> 00:56:58,828
Not natural?

808
00:56:58,869 --> 00:57:00,999
You mean it was constructed?

809
00:57:01,041 --> 00:57:04,014
It's very possible
whoever made the Orbs

810
00:57:04,047 --> 00:57:06,177
also created this wormhole.

811
00:57:06,219 --> 00:57:09,021
The Cardassians
are leaving their position

812
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:11,462
on a course toward
the Denorios Belt.

813
00:57:11,498 --> 00:57:13,195
Mr. O'Brien

814
00:57:13,235 --> 00:57:16,333
what would it take
to move this station

815
00:57:16,409 --> 00:57:18,710
to the mouth of the wormhole?

816
00:57:18,748 --> 00:57:20,981
This isn't a starship, Major.

817
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,287
We've got six working thrusters
to power us and that's it.

818
00:57:23,325 --> 00:57:26,025
160 million-kilometer
trip would take

819
00:57:26,064 --> 00:57:27,363
two months.

820
00:57:27,401 --> 00:57:28,893
It has to be there tomorrow.

821
00:57:28,938 --> 00:57:30,771
That's not possible, sir.

822
00:57:30,808 --> 00:57:32,539
That wormhole
might just reshape

823
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:34,517
the future
of this entire quadrant.

824
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:36,954
The Bajorans have
to stake a claim to it

825
00:57:36,989 --> 00:57:37,979
and I have to admit

826
00:57:38,026 --> 00:57:39,859
that claim would be
a lot stronger

827
00:57:39,896 --> 00:57:43,267
if there's a Federation presence
to back it up.

828
00:57:43,304 --> 00:57:45,867
Couldn't you modify
the subspace field output

829
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:47,812
of the deflector generators
just enough

830
00:57:47,847 --> 00:57:50,786
to create a low-level field
around the station?

831
00:57:50,821 --> 00:57:52,723
So we could lower
the inertial mass.

832
00:57:52,759 --> 00:57:55,732
If you can make
the station lighter

833
00:57:55,766 --> 00:57:58,431
those six thrusters
will be all the power we need.

834
00:57:58,472 --> 00:57:59,440
This whole station

835
00:57:59,507 --> 00:58:01,671
could break apart like
an egg if it doesn't work.

836
00:58:01,713 --> 00:58:03,741
Even if it does work,
we're still going

837
00:58:03,784 --> 00:58:06,255
to need help from Starfleet
once we get there.

838
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:08,284
The <i>Enterprise</i> is still
the nearest starship.

839
00:58:08,328 --> 00:58:09,763
They could reach us in two days.

840
00:58:09,798 --> 00:58:12,031
We should advise Starfleet

841
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:14,405
that we will require
their assistance.

842
00:58:14,476 --> 00:58:16,309
You have Ops, Mr. O'Brien.

843
00:58:16,346 --> 00:58:18,283
Lieutenant, you're with me.

844
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:19,286
Aye, sir.

845
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,789
You too, Doc.

846
00:58:20,823 --> 00:58:22,953
Time to be a hero.

847
00:58:22,995 --> 00:58:24,658
Yes, sir!

848
00:58:37,696 --> 00:58:39,165
Constable...

849
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:40,828
This is a security matter.

850
00:58:40,869 --> 00:58:42,668
I'm in charge of security.

851
00:58:42,708 --> 00:58:44,007
Security here, on the station.

852
00:58:44,043 --> 00:58:46,105
I cannot justify taking
you into this wormhole.

853
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:48,312
We have no idea what we're
dealing with in there.

854
00:58:48,353 --> 00:58:49,343
It could be hostile...

855
00:58:49,389 --> 00:58:53,991
Major, I was found
in the Denorios Belt.

856
00:58:54,033 --> 00:58:56,300
I don't know where I came from...

857
00:58:56,338 --> 00:58:59,209
no idea if there are
any others like me.

858
00:58:59,245 --> 00:59:02,548
All my life, I've been forced
to pass myself off as one of you

859
00:59:02,586 --> 00:59:05,354
always wondering
who I really am.

860
00:59:06,963 --> 00:59:08,900
Well, the answers
to a lot of my questions

861
00:59:08,934 --> 00:59:11,428
may be somewhere on
the other side of that wormhole.

862
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:18,482
You coming?

863
00:59:35,802 --> 00:59:38,934
The creature must be destroyed
before it destroys us.

864
00:59:38,976 --> 00:59:40,468
It is malevolent.

865
00:59:41,481 --> 00:59:42,950
Aggressive.

866
00:59:42,985 --> 00:59:44,545
Adversarial.

867
00:59:44,588 --> 00:59:46,353
It must be destroyed.

868
00:59:46,392 --> 00:59:47,861
I am not your enemy.

869
00:59:47,895 --> 00:59:50,264
I was sent here by the people
you contacted.

870
00:59:50,301 --> 00:59:51,531
Contacted?

871
00:59:51,571 --> 00:59:53,906
With your devices... your Orbs.

872
00:59:53,943 --> 00:59:56,711
We seek contact
with other life-forms

873
00:59:56,750 --> 01:00:00,282
not corporeal creatures
who annihilate us.

874
01:00:00,324 --> 01:00:03,821
I have not come
to annihilate anyone.

875
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:05,631
Destroy it now.

876
01:00:07,073 --> 01:00:11,607
My species respects life
above all else.

877
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:14,555
Can you say the same?

878
01:00:17,029 --> 01:00:20,526
I do not understand the threat
that I bring to you

879
01:00:20,571 --> 01:00:22,701
but I am not your enemy.

880
01:00:22,742 --> 01:00:26,147
Allow me to prove it.

881
01:00:26,184 --> 01:00:27,483
Prove it?

882
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,353
It can be argued

883
01:00:29,391 --> 01:00:32,728
that a human is ultimately
the sum of his experiences.

884
01:00:32,765 --> 01:00:34,359
Experiences...

885
01:00:34,403 --> 01:00:36,032
what is this?

886
01:00:36,073 --> 01:00:37,633
Memories.

887
01:00:37,677 --> 01:00:39,875
Events from my past

888
01:00:39,915 --> 01:00:41,817
like this one.

889
01:00:41,853 --> 01:00:43,322
Past?

890
01:00:43,356 --> 01:00:45,850
Things that happened before now.

891
01:00:47,867 --> 01:00:52,333
You have absolutely no idea
what I'm talking about.

892
01:00:52,377 --> 01:00:55,145
What comes before now
is no different

893
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:59,456
than what is now,
or what is to come.

894
01:00:59,493 --> 01:01:01,964
It is one's existence.

895
01:01:01,999 --> 01:01:07,877
Then, for you,
there is no linear time.

896
01:01:07,913 --> 01:01:10,886
Linear time... what is this?

897
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,688
My species lives
in one point in time

898
01:01:13,726 --> 01:01:16,563
and once we move
beyond that point

899
01:01:16,599 --> 01:01:18,570
it becomes the past.

900
01:01:18,604 --> 01:01:21,577
The future, all that
is still to come

901
01:01:21,611 --> 01:01:23,741
does not exist yet for us.

902
01:01:23,783 --> 01:01:25,754
Does not exist yet?

903
01:01:25,787 --> 01:01:28,258
That is the nature
of linear existence

904
01:01:28,293 --> 01:01:31,425
and if you examine
it more closely

905
01:01:31,467 --> 01:01:34,463
you will see that you
do not need to fear me.

906
01:01:46,234 --> 01:01:48,296
Partial field established.

907
01:01:48,373 --> 01:01:50,640
Instability at 12%.

908
01:01:50,678 --> 01:01:52,649
Partial field?

909
01:01:56,024 --> 01:01:58,461
Is station's inertial mass
low enough to break orbit?

910
01:01:58,496 --> 01:02:00,227
Procedure is not recommended.

911
01:02:00,266 --> 01:02:02,260
Damn it, I didn't ask
for an opinion.

912
01:02:02,305 --> 01:02:05,142
Just tell me whether or not
we can get enough thrust

913
01:02:05,177 --> 01:02:07,273
with only a partial field
established.

914
01:02:07,316 --> 01:02:08,615
Affirmative.

915
01:02:08,652 --> 01:02:09,985
All right. Thank you.

916
01:02:11,993 --> 01:02:14,624
Initiate transit mode,
three-axis stabilization.

917
01:02:14,666 --> 01:02:15,896
Aye, sir.

918
01:02:15,935 --> 01:02:17,768
Engage thrusters.

919
01:02:28,331 --> 01:02:30,768
Warning.
Field integrity declining.

920
01:02:30,803 --> 01:02:33,001
Instability at 21%.

921
01:02:33,042 --> 01:02:35,240
We've got to close that gap
in the field

922
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,911
or we'll tear ourselves
into a million pieces.

923
01:02:37,953 --> 01:02:40,926
Warning. Subspace field
collapse in 60 seconds.

924
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,293
Computer

925
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:44,893
transfer energy
from the inertial dampers

926
01:02:44,935 --> 01:02:47,065
to reinforce the subspace field.

927
01:02:47,107 --> 01:02:48,838
Procedure is not recommended.

928
01:02:48,878 --> 01:02:50,849
Damn it, transfer the energy.

929
01:02:50,883 --> 01:02:52,216
Unable to comply.

930
01:02:52,253 --> 01:02:54,747
Level-1 safety protocols
have canceled request.

931
01:02:54,792 --> 01:02:56,091
Canceled it?

932
01:02:56,128 --> 01:02:59,101
Warning. Subspace field
collapse in 30 seconds.

933
01:02:59,134 --> 01:03:01,332
I'm going to transfer it
manually.

934
01:03:01,373 --> 01:03:05,041
On my mark, redirect the flow
to the deflectors

935
01:03:05,082 --> 01:03:06,107
and keep the power balanced.

936
01:03:06,151 --> 01:03:07,119
Aye, sir.

937
01:03:07,153 --> 01:03:09,716
Field collapse in 15 seconds.

938
01:03:11,062 --> 01:03:12,497
Now.

939
01:03:22,422 --> 01:03:24,757
Field energy
now within flight tolerances.

940
01:03:27,533 --> 01:03:29,800
Good work, sir.

941
01:03:34,015 --> 01:03:39,551
Computer, you and I need
to have a little talk.

942
01:03:46,677 --> 01:03:50,048
The Cardassian warship
is in visual range.

943
01:03:50,085 --> 01:03:52,181
On screen.

944
01:03:54,562 --> 01:03:56,122
They're headed right to it.

945
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:58,296
Well, they've got to listen
to reason, haven't they?

946
01:03:58,337 --> 01:04:01,640
When we warn them what could
happen if they go in there.

947
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:03,809
Doctor, most people,
in my experience

948
01:04:03,851 --> 01:04:07,313
wouldn't know reason if it
walked up and shook their hand.

949
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:09,693
You can count Gul Dukat
among them.

950
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:12,703
This is the Federation
Ship <i>Yangtzee Kiang.</i>

951
01:04:12,737 --> 01:04:14,901
Major Kira Nerys in command.

952
01:04:15,677 --> 01:04:17,306
Yes, Major.

953
01:04:17,348 --> 01:04:20,048
Gul Dukat, we know you're headed
for the wormhole.

954
01:04:20,088 --> 01:04:21,614
Wormhole?

955
01:04:21,658 --> 01:04:24,859
What wormhole is that?

956
01:04:24,899 --> 01:04:27,701
I strongly suggest
you do not proceed.

957
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:30,974
We encountered
a hostile life-form inside.

958
01:04:31,013 --> 01:04:33,815
Perhaps they will be
less hostile to Cardassians

959
01:04:33,852 --> 01:04:35,321
than to humans.

960
01:04:35,355 --> 01:04:36,756
Dukat

961
01:04:36,792 --> 01:04:38,261
these people are trying

962
01:04:38,296 --> 01:04:40,267
to save you
from a lot of trouble.

963
01:04:40,301 --> 01:04:41,428
Really?

964
01:04:41,469 --> 01:04:43,940
And I suppose
you're going to tell me

965
01:04:43,976 --> 01:04:46,004
that these are not
the life-forms

966
01:04:46,047 --> 01:04:47,846
that have sent the Orbs

967
01:04:47,885 --> 01:04:50,619
or that your Commander Sisko
is not negotiating

968
01:04:50,657 --> 01:04:52,651
for their technology.

969
01:04:52,696 --> 01:04:55,133
I thank you for your concern

970
01:04:55,168 --> 01:05:00,077
but I think we will see
for ourselves.

971
01:05:04,589 --> 01:05:06,992
So much for reason.

972
01:05:09,735 --> 01:05:11,865
Jennifer.

973
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:25,203
Yes, that was her name.

974
01:05:25,237 --> 01:05:27,538
She is part of your existence.

975
01:05:27,642 --> 01:05:29,636
She is part of my past.

976
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,547
She's no longer alive.

977
01:05:31,584 --> 01:05:33,885
But she is part
of your existence.

978
01:05:33,923 --> 01:05:37,192
She was a most important
part of my existence

979
01:05:37,231 --> 01:05:39,202
but I lost her some time ago.

980
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:40,898
Lost?

981
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:42,705
What is this?

982
01:05:42,744 --> 01:05:46,776
In a linear existence,
we can't go back to the past

983
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:49,291
to get something we left behind

984
01:05:49,325 --> 01:05:53,357
so... it's lost.

985
01:05:53,402 --> 01:05:55,873
It is inconceivable
that any species

986
01:05:55,907 --> 01:05:58,174
could exist in such a manner.

987
01:05:58,213 --> 01:05:59,807
You are deceiving us.

988
01:05:59,850 --> 01:06:01,149
No.

989
01:06:01,186 --> 01:06:02,883
This is the truth.

990
01:06:02,923 --> 01:06:06,294
This day, this...
this park...

991
01:06:06,332 --> 01:06:12,245
it was almost 15 years
ago, far in the past.

992
01:06:12,278 --> 01:06:16,219
It was a day that was
very important to me...

993
01:06:16,254 --> 01:06:20,560
a day that shaped
every day that followed.

994
01:06:20,597 --> 01:06:25,006
That is the essence
of a linear existence.

995
01:06:25,041 --> 01:06:29,210
Each day affects the next.

996
01:06:39,508 --> 01:06:41,638
Listen to it.

997
01:06:41,679 --> 01:06:44,344
To what?

998
01:06:44,385 --> 01:06:46,454
The sound of children playing.

999
01:06:46,587 --> 01:06:49,081
What could be more beautiful?

1000
01:06:49,126 --> 01:06:50,857
So you like children.

1001
01:06:50,896 --> 01:06:54,860
That almost sounds
like a domestic inquiry.

1002
01:06:54,906 --> 01:06:57,879
I've heard Starfleet officers
don't want families

1003
01:06:57,913 --> 01:07:00,784
because they complicate
their lives.

1004
01:07:00,819 --> 01:07:03,450
Starfleet officers
don't often find mates

1005
01:07:03,493 --> 01:07:06,124
who want to raise families
on a starship.

1006
01:07:06,165 --> 01:07:09,536
That almost sounds
like a domestic inquiry.

1007
01:07:09,573 --> 01:07:12,341
I think it was.

1008
01:07:35,867 --> 01:07:38,202
As corporeal entities

1009
01:07:38,239 --> 01:07:41,576
humans find physical
touch to cause pleasure.

1010
01:07:41,613 --> 01:07:42,980
Pleasure...

1011
01:07:43,016 --> 01:07:45,283
what is this?

1012
01:07:47,059 --> 01:07:49,326
Good feelings.

1013
01:07:49,431 --> 01:07:51,425
Happiness.

1014
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:57,711
But this is your existence.

1015
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:59,846
It's difficult to be here...

1016
01:07:59,889 --> 01:08:02,623
more difficult
than any other memory.

1017
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:04,495
Why?

1018
01:08:04,533 --> 01:08:06,059
Because...

1019
01:08:07,573 --> 01:08:10,569
because this was the day...

1020
01:08:12,317 --> 01:08:14,345
that I lost Jennifer.

1021
01:08:18,264 --> 01:08:20,735
I don't want to be here.

1022
01:08:27,184 --> 01:08:29,986
Then why do you exist here?

1023
01:08:31,428 --> 01:08:34,230
I don't understand.

1024
01:08:34,268 --> 01:08:36,637
You exist here.

1025
01:08:47,264 --> 01:08:48,756
What's wrong?

1026
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,828
What's happening?

1027
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:03,868
We should be reaching

1028
01:09:03,902 --> 01:09:05,769
the wormhole coordinates
in two minutes.

1029
01:09:05,807 --> 01:09:08,404
Slowing to one-third imp...

1030
01:09:27,523 --> 01:09:29,322
Are you still there?

1031
01:09:29,361 --> 01:09:31,160
What just happened?

1032
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:33,193
More of your kind.

1033
01:09:33,236 --> 01:09:34,865
Another ship...

1034
01:09:34,906 --> 01:09:36,535
in the wormhole?

1035
01:09:36,578 --> 01:09:38,047
Wormhole?

1036
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,549
What is this?

1037
01:09:39,584 --> 01:09:41,213
It is how we describe

1038
01:09:41,255 --> 01:09:43,419
the passage
that brought me here.

1039
01:09:43,459 --> 01:09:44,552
It is terminated.

1040
01:09:44,596 --> 01:09:45,895
Terminated?

1041
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:47,663
Our existence is disrupted

1042
01:09:47,703 --> 01:09:49,901
whenever one of you
enters the passage.

1043
01:09:49,941 --> 01:09:52,880
Your linear nature
is inherently destructive.

1044
01:09:52,915 --> 01:09:54,384
You have no regard

1045
01:09:54,419 --> 01:09:56,652
for the consequences
of your acts.

1046
01:09:56,691 --> 01:09:57,818
That's not true.

1047
01:09:57,859 --> 01:10:00,353
We're aware that every choice
we make has a consequence.

1048
01:10:02,236 --> 01:10:05,038
But you claim you do not know
what it will be.

1049
01:10:05,077 --> 01:10:06,204
We don't.

1050
01:10:06,245 --> 01:10:07,680
Then how can you take

1051
01:10:07,716 --> 01:10:10,017
responsibility
for your actions?

1052
01:10:10,054 --> 01:10:12,685
We use past experience
to help guide us.

1053
01:10:12,727 --> 01:10:15,130
For Jennifer and me

1054
01:10:15,166 --> 01:10:17,296
all the experiences
in our lives

1055
01:10:17,337 --> 01:10:20,139
prepared us for the day
we met on the beach...

1056
01:10:20,177 --> 01:10:23,639
helped us recognize
that we had a future together.

1057
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:25,657
When we married, we accepted

1058
01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:28,161
all the consequences
of that act

1059
01:10:28,196 --> 01:10:29,825
whatever they might be

1060
01:10:29,867 --> 01:10:32,168
including the consequences
of you.

1061
01:10:32,205 --> 01:10:33,504
Me?

1062
01:10:33,541 --> 01:10:35,238
My son Jake...

1063
01:10:35,279 --> 01:10:37,375
The child with Jennifer.

1064
01:10:37,416 --> 01:10:39,512
Yes.

1065
01:10:39,555 --> 01:10:43,052
Linear... procreation?

1066
01:10:43,097 --> 01:10:44,396
Yes.

1067
01:10:44,433 --> 01:10:47,531
Jake is the continuation
of our family.

1068
01:10:47,574 --> 01:10:50,376
The sound of children playing.

1069
01:10:51,182 --> 01:10:52,617
Aggressive.

1070
01:10:52,685 --> 01:10:54,314
Adversarial.

1071
01:10:54,355 --> 01:10:55,619
Competition.

1072
01:10:55,692 --> 01:10:57,025
For fun.

1073
01:10:57,062 --> 01:10:59,762
It's a game that Jake
and I play on the holodeck.

1074
01:10:59,802 --> 01:11:02,000
It's called baseball.

1075
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:03,839
Baseball?

1076
01:11:03,878 --> 01:11:05,711
What is this?

1077
01:11:05,748 --> 01:11:09,051
I was afraid you'd ask that.

1078
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:12,063
I throw this ball to you

1079
01:11:12,097 --> 01:11:16,506
and this other player
stands between us with a bat...

1080
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:19,513
a stick... and he...

1081
01:11:19,547 --> 01:11:22,520
and he tries to hit the ball

1082
01:11:22,554 --> 01:11:25,356
in between
these two white lines.

1083
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:32,769
Oh.

1084
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:35,783
The rules aren't important.

1085
01:11:35,817 --> 01:11:38,790
What's important is...

1086
01:11:38,824 --> 01:11:41,091
it's linear.

1087
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,260
Every time I throw this ball

1088
01:11:43,302 --> 01:11:46,799
a hundred different things
can happen in a game.

1089
01:11:46,843 --> 01:11:49,406
He might swing and miss,
he might hit it.

1090
01:11:49,449 --> 01:11:52,080
The point is you never know.

1091
01:11:52,121 --> 01:11:53,920
You try to anticipate

1092
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,263
set a strategy
for all the possibilities

1093
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,703
as best you can, but in the end

1094
01:11:59,772 --> 01:12:02,745
it comes down to throwing
one pitch after another

1095
01:12:02,779 --> 01:12:04,807
and seeing what happens.

1096
01:12:04,851 --> 01:12:08,656
With each new consequence,
the game begins to take shape.

1097
01:12:08,693 --> 01:12:11,187
And you have no idea
what that shape is

1098
01:12:11,232 --> 01:12:12,861
until it is completed.

1099
01:12:12,902 --> 01:12:13,870
That's right.

1100
01:12:13,905 --> 01:12:16,240
In fact, the game
wouldn't be worth playing

1101
01:12:16,277 --> 01:12:18,680
if we knew
what was going to happen.

1102
01:12:18,783 --> 01:12:22,690
You value your ignorance
of what is to come?

1103
01:12:22,792 --> 01:12:25,423
That may be
the most important thing

1104
01:12:25,465 --> 01:12:27,436
to understand about humans.

1105
01:12:27,469 --> 01:12:31,137
It is the unknown
that defines our existence.

1106
01:12:31,178 --> 01:12:33,479
We are constantly searching

1107
01:12:33,517 --> 01:12:35,715
not just for answers
to our questions

1108
01:12:35,822 --> 01:12:38,123
but for new questions.

1109
01:12:38,161 --> 01:12:40,132
We are explorers.

1110
01:12:40,166 --> 01:12:43,333
We explore our lives day by day

1111
01:12:43,373 --> 01:12:45,344
and we explore the galaxy

1112
01:12:45,378 --> 01:12:49,012
trying to expand
the boundaries of our knowledge

1113
01:12:49,052 --> 01:12:51,523
and that is why I am here...

1114
01:12:51,559 --> 01:12:53,928
not to conquer you with weapons

1115
01:12:53,964 --> 01:12:56,937
or with ideas

1116
01:12:56,971 --> 01:12:59,602
but to coexist...

1117
01:12:59,643 --> 01:13:01,306
and learn.

1118
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:05,619
If all you say is true

1119
01:13:05,657 --> 01:13:07,753
why do you exist here?

1120
01:13:21,385 --> 01:13:23,549
First Officer's Log,
supplemental.

1121
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:25,355
We've rendezvoused
with the space station

1122
01:13:25,395 --> 01:13:27,593
at the former coordinates
of the wormhole.

1123
01:13:27,633 --> 01:13:29,695
Unfortunately,
our scans have revealed

1124
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:33,235
no trace of either the wormhole
or Dukat's ship.

1125
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,248
A few minutes ago

1126
01:13:34,315 --> 01:13:36,843
three Cardassian warships
crossed the border

1127
01:13:36,887 --> 01:13:38,720
no doubt on their way
to search for Dukat.

1128
01:13:38,759 --> 01:13:41,664
Mr. O'Brien, can you establish
a high-energy thoron field

1129
01:13:41,699 --> 01:13:43,693
before they get
into sensor range?

1130
01:13:43,736 --> 01:13:45,934
I don't want them
to be able to scan

1131
01:13:45,975 --> 01:13:47,877
- our defense systems.
- Aye, sir.

1132
01:13:47,913 --> 01:13:49,884
They're hailing us.

1133
01:13:49,917 --> 01:13:52,411
On screen.

1134
01:13:53,159 --> 01:13:55,426
I am Gul Jasad

1135
01:13:55,464 --> 01:13:59,098
of the Cardassian guard,
Seventh Order.

1136
01:13:59,139 --> 01:14:01,474
Where is our warship?

1137
01:14:01,511 --> 01:14:04,484
With any luck,
they're in the Gamma Quadrant

1138
01:14:04,518 --> 01:14:05,782
on the other side
of the wormhole.

1139
01:14:05,821 --> 01:14:07,120
What wormhole?

1140
01:14:07,158 --> 01:14:09,561
Our sensors show no indication

1141
01:14:09,596 --> 01:14:11,726
of a wormhole in this sector.

1142
01:14:11,768 --> 01:14:14,171
That's because
it just collapsed.

1143
01:14:14,207 --> 01:14:15,676
What?!

1144
01:14:15,710 --> 01:14:18,045
We believe it was
artificially created.

1145
01:14:18,082 --> 01:14:20,987
That may be why our sensors
never picked up

1146
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:23,996
any of the usual quantum
fluctuation patterns.

1147
01:14:24,030 --> 01:14:27,664
You expect me to believe
that someone created a wormhole

1148
01:14:27,704 --> 01:14:30,438
and now conveniently
has disassembled it?

1149
01:14:30,477 --> 01:14:33,507
That's exactly
what I expect you to believe.

1150
01:14:36,858 --> 01:14:40,161
They're flooding subspace
with antilepton interference.

1151
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,330
It'll cut off our communications
with Starfleet.

1152
01:14:42,439 --> 01:14:44,238
They're powering up
their forward phasers.

1153
01:14:44,276 --> 01:14:45,643
Red Alert.

1154
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:46,647
Shields up.

1155
01:14:46,681 --> 01:14:48,310
What shields?

1156
01:14:48,352 --> 01:14:52,191
They're hailing us again.

1157
01:14:53,497 --> 01:14:55,330
Open the channel.

1158
01:14:56,103 --> 01:14:59,508
We do not accept
your explanation.

1159
01:14:59,544 --> 01:15:02,608
Somehow you have destroyed
our warship.

1160
01:15:02,652 --> 01:15:05,625
Gul Jasad, I assure you...

1161
01:15:05,659 --> 01:15:10,329
We demand the unconditional
surrender of this space station

1162
01:15:10,369 --> 01:15:12,772
or we will open fire.

1163
01:15:15,848 --> 01:15:17,819
I need at least a day

1164
01:15:17,853 --> 01:15:20,416
to make the necessary
preparations.

1165
01:15:22,964 --> 01:15:26,928
You have one hour.

1166
01:15:47,121 --> 01:15:49,558
I can transfer
all available power

1167
01:15:49,593 --> 01:15:51,962
to establish partial shields
around critical areas

1168
01:15:51,998 --> 01:15:54,231
but if they hit the docking ring

1169
01:15:54,270 --> 01:15:55,762
we'll sustain heavy damage.

1170
01:15:55,807 --> 01:15:58,438
Constable,
if you would coordinate

1171
01:15:58,513 --> 01:16:00,677
moving all personnel
to safer locations.

1172
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:06,694
What was the last reported
position of the <i>Enterprise?</i>

1173
01:16:06,732 --> 01:16:09,260
At least 20 hours away.

1174
01:16:09,304 --> 01:16:11,969
We've got to hold out
till they get here.

1175
01:16:12,011 --> 01:16:13,605
I can't believe the Cardassians

1176
01:16:13,648 --> 01:16:15,710
would ever attack
a Federation outpost.

1177
01:16:15,753 --> 01:16:17,052
Doctor, you ever studied

1178
01:16:17,088 --> 01:16:19,059
your military history
of the border wars?

1179
01:16:19,093 --> 01:16:20,061
Yes.

1180
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:21,894
Ever heard
of the Setlik III massacre?

1181
01:16:21,934 --> 01:16:23,767
I assume, Mr. O'Brien,
you would agree

1182
01:16:23,804 --> 01:16:25,798
surrender is not
a preferable option.

1183
01:16:25,843 --> 01:16:28,178
You know what they do
to their prisoners, sir.

1184
01:16:45,587 --> 01:16:48,458
What is the point of bringing me
back again to this?

1185
01:16:50,131 --> 01:16:52,125
We do not bring you here.

1186
01:16:52,169 --> 01:16:54,470
You bring us here.

1187
01:16:54,508 --> 01:16:57,413
You exist here.

1188
01:16:57,448 --> 01:16:59,145
Then give me the power

1189
01:16:59,185 --> 01:17:02,317
to lead you somewhere
else... anywhere else.

1190
01:17:02,359 --> 01:17:06,198
We cannot give you
what you deny yourself.

1191
01:17:06,235 --> 01:17:09,801
Look for solutions from within,
Commander.

1192
01:17:16,693 --> 01:17:20,498
I was ready to die with her.

1193
01:17:20,602 --> 01:17:22,664
Die... what is this?

1194
01:17:23,976 --> 01:17:28,351
The termination
of their linear existence.

1195
01:17:41,549 --> 01:17:43,850
We've got to go now, sir.

1196
01:17:43,888 --> 01:17:45,357
Damn it!

1197
01:17:45,392 --> 01:17:47,863
We just can't leave her here.

1198
01:17:47,897 --> 01:17:51,736
Oh! Oh, no!

1199
01:17:55,081 --> 01:17:56,983
I never left this ship.

1200
01:17:57,018 --> 01:17:59,216
You exist here.

1201
01:18:02,431 --> 01:18:05,529
I...

1202
01:18:05,604 --> 01:18:07,598
exist here.

1203
01:18:23,312 --> 01:18:26,342
I don't know
if you can understand.

1204
01:18:26,385 --> 01:18:28,549
I see her like this

1205
01:18:28,591 --> 01:18:32,293
every time I close my eyes.

1206
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:35,306
In the darkness...

1207
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:38,609
in the blink of an eye

1208
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:42,621
I see her like this.

1209
01:18:42,656 --> 01:18:45,493
None of your past experiences
helped prepare you

1210
01:18:45,530 --> 01:18:47,022
for this consequence.

1211
01:18:47,066 --> 01:18:53,206
And I have never figured out
how to live without her.

1212
01:18:53,247 --> 01:18:56,516
So you choose to exist here.

1213
01:19:01,233 --> 01:19:03,135
It is not linear.

1214
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,711
No.

1215
01:19:06,745 --> 01:19:08,909
It's not linear.

1216
01:19:33,439 --> 01:19:35,272
Oh...

1217
01:19:48,943 --> 01:19:51,916
Their lead ship is hailing us.

1218
01:19:51,949 --> 01:19:54,420
Gul Jasad wants an answer.

1219
01:19:54,455 --> 01:19:56,426
Are you ready, Mr. O'Brien?

1220
01:19:56,459 --> 01:19:58,088
Yes, sir.

1221
01:19:58,129 --> 01:20:00,600
When they penetrate
our thoron field

1222
01:20:00,636 --> 01:20:03,609
it should raise a few
eyebrows over there.

1223
01:20:03,643 --> 01:20:06,946
All right, then,
let's give them our answer.

1224
01:20:06,984 --> 01:20:10,550
Fire six photon torpedoes
across Jasad's bow.

1225
01:20:10,592 --> 01:20:13,394
We only have six photons, Major.

1226
01:20:13,431 --> 01:20:16,700
We're not going to win this
battle with torpedoes, Chief.

1227
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:18,904
Aye, sir.

1228
01:20:23,789 --> 01:20:25,919
An urgent hail from Jasad.

1229
01:20:25,961 --> 01:20:28,159
Looks like we got his attention.

1230
01:20:29,803 --> 01:20:30,903
On screen.

1231
01:20:31,571 --> 01:20:32,870
This is your answer?

1232
01:20:32,908 --> 01:20:34,001
You don't think

1233
01:20:34,043 --> 01:20:36,606
Starfleet took command
of this space station

1234
01:20:36,649 --> 01:20:38,847
without the ability
to defend it, do you?

1235
01:20:38,887 --> 01:20:39,877
Defend it?

1236
01:20:40,992 --> 01:20:44,295
Your space station
could not defend itself

1237
01:20:44,333 --> 01:20:47,363
against one Cardassian warship.

1238
01:20:47,407 --> 01:20:49,708
You're probably right, Jasad...

1239
01:20:51,684 --> 01:20:55,318
and if you were dealing
with a Starfleet officer

1240
01:20:55,359 --> 01:20:57,330
they'd probably admit

1241
01:20:57,363 --> 01:21:00,336
we have a hopeless cause here

1242
01:21:00,370 --> 01:21:03,673
but I am just a Bajoran

1243
01:21:03,712 --> 01:21:05,181
who's been fighting

1244
01:21:05,215 --> 01:21:08,484
a hopeless cause
against the Cardassians

1245
01:21:08,556 --> 01:21:11,461
all her life.

1246
01:21:11,496 --> 01:21:14,298
So if you want a war...

1247
01:21:14,335 --> 01:21:17,137
I'll give you one.

1248
01:21:23,523 --> 01:21:25,152
Major.

1249
01:21:25,195 --> 01:21:27,666
Remind me never
to get into a game

1250
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:30,194
of Roladan Wild Draw with you.

1251
01:21:42,601 --> 01:21:45,972
They were using a thoron field
to block our sensors

1252
01:21:46,009 --> 01:21:47,946
but we were able
to penetrate it.

1253
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:50,451
What are their defenses?

1254
01:21:50,485 --> 01:21:54,825
According to our scans,
an estimated 5,000 photons

1255
01:21:54,862 --> 01:21:57,596
integrated phaser banks
on all levels.

1256
01:21:57,702 --> 01:22:00,139
When did they receive
these armaments?

1257
01:22:00,174 --> 01:22:02,805
And how did they install
them without our knowledge?

1258
01:22:04,284 --> 01:22:09,695
Somehow they have created
a massive illusion

1259
01:22:09,729 --> 01:22:12,394
of duranium shadows.

1260
01:22:12,436 --> 01:22:14,532
What if it is not an illusion?

1261
01:22:14,574 --> 01:22:15,975
It is.

1262
01:22:16,010 --> 01:22:17,947
Why risk the confrontation?

1263
01:22:17,982 --> 01:22:21,046
The Fourth Order
can be here in a day.

1264
01:22:21,089 --> 01:22:23,117
So can Starfleet.

1265
01:22:27,838 --> 01:22:30,366
Their lead ship is sending out
a subspace message

1266
01:22:30,410 --> 01:22:31,777
asking for reinforcements.

1267
01:22:31,814 --> 01:22:32,782
Yes!

1268
01:22:32,816 --> 01:22:35,481
Too soon for
a victory celebration, Doctor.

1269
01:22:36,826 --> 01:22:37,953
Mr. O'Brien?

1270
01:22:37,995 --> 01:22:39,122
The ships are being deployed

1271
01:22:39,164 --> 01:22:41,829
in a standard
attack formation, sir.

1272
01:22:42,972 --> 01:22:44,966
Battle stations.

1273
01:22:54,833 --> 01:22:56,963
Quickly, now.
Quickly, now.

1274
01:22:57,005 --> 01:22:58,474
Calmly, calmly.

1275
01:22:58,509 --> 01:23:00,172
Come along.

1276
01:23:01,381 --> 01:23:03,214
They may just be testing us.

1277
01:23:03,253 --> 01:23:05,850
I could run a pulse
compression wave

1278
01:23:05,892 --> 01:23:07,863
through the phaser banks...

1279
01:23:07,897 --> 01:23:10,300
put out a blast that will
make them think twice.

1280
01:23:10,335 --> 01:23:11,325
Do it.

1281
01:23:17,485 --> 01:23:18,784
Damage report.

1282
01:23:18,822 --> 01:23:20,451
Direct hit, level 14.

1283
01:23:20,492 --> 01:23:22,121
Empty storage bays.

1284
01:23:22,162 --> 01:23:23,461
No casualties.

1285
01:23:23,499 --> 01:23:26,164
Shields down to 27%.

1286
01:23:49,292 --> 01:23:52,858
A fuel conduit
has ruptured on the Promenade.

1287
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:55,873
Can you divert
the main power flow?

1288
01:23:57,110 --> 01:23:58,374
The controls are locked.

1289
01:23:58,412 --> 01:23:59,471
Odo to Ops.

1290
01:23:59,515 --> 01:24:00,483
Go ahead.

1291
01:24:00,517 --> 01:24:02,043
I've got wounded people
down here!

1292
01:24:02,087 --> 01:24:04,320
Have you seen that Doctor
of yours anywhere?

1293
01:24:04,359 --> 01:24:05,589
I'm on my way.

1294
01:24:08,736 --> 01:24:11,139
I'm going to have to shut down
the primary power flow

1295
01:24:11,175 --> 01:24:12,735
or the whole Promenade
will go up.

1296
01:24:14,216 --> 01:24:15,845
Bloody Cardassians!

1297
01:24:15,886 --> 01:24:18,221
I just got the damn thing fixed.

1298
01:24:29,818 --> 01:24:32,586
Press there, hard.

1299
01:24:33,793 --> 01:24:36,891
Look, Doctor, maybe I should
find you someone...

1300
01:24:36,934 --> 01:24:40,500
Hold it there.

1301
01:24:51,969 --> 01:24:54,737
That should do it for a while.

1302
01:24:54,776 --> 01:24:56,747
Shields are at 18% and falling.

1303
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:58,944
I might still be able
to give you

1304
01:24:58,985 --> 01:25:00,922
one more phaser blast, Major.

1305
01:25:00,956 --> 01:25:02,653
No.

1306
01:25:13,652 --> 01:25:16,955
Signal the lead Cardassian ship
that we will proceed with...

1307
01:25:16,992 --> 01:25:17,960
Major...

1308
01:25:17,995 --> 01:25:20,228
I'm picking up
a huge neutrino disturbance

1309
01:25:20,267 --> 01:25:22,795
15 kilometers
off the forward docking ring.

1310
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,834
It's the wormhole.

1311
01:25:26,180 --> 01:25:28,481
On screen.

1312
01:25:31,827 --> 01:25:33,821
Hail the lead ship.

1313
01:25:33,898 --> 01:25:35,527
What did I tell you, Jasad?

1314
01:25:35,569 --> 01:25:37,506
There's your wormhole!

1315
01:25:47,696 --> 01:25:49,188
<i>Rio Grande</i> to DS9.

1316
01:25:49,233 --> 01:25:50,326
On screen.

1317
01:25:50,370 --> 01:25:51,862
Go ahead, Commander.

1318
01:25:51,907 --> 01:25:53,103
Sorry to be late, Major.

1319
01:25:53,142 --> 01:25:55,306
Our friend Gul Dukat
had some problems

1320
01:25:55,347 --> 01:25:57,112
on the other side
of the wormhole.

1321
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:59,214
I see you've had
a few of your own.

1322
01:25:59,256 --> 01:26:01,089
A few, Commander.

1323
01:26:02,698 --> 01:26:06,035
Gul Dukat is signaling
his ships to disarm.

1324
01:26:06,072 --> 01:26:08,202
Clear me for docking,
Mr. O'Brien.

1325
01:26:08,244 --> 01:26:09,645
Aye, sir.

1326
01:26:09,681 --> 01:26:11,675
Cleared for Pad C.

1327
01:26:38,413 --> 01:26:40,212
Casualties?

1328
01:26:40,251 --> 01:26:44,090
13 injured, Commander,
and no fatalities.

1329
01:26:48,837 --> 01:26:50,739
Jake!

1330
01:26:51,778 --> 01:26:52,837
Dad!

1331
01:27:04,406 --> 01:27:07,071
Station Log,
Commander Benjamin Sisko

1332
01:27:07,112 --> 01:27:10,051
Stardate 46393.1.

1333
01:27:10,086 --> 01:27:11,919
The life-forms
who created the wormhole

1334
01:27:11,991 --> 01:27:13,483
have agreed
to allow safe passage

1335
01:27:13,527 --> 01:27:15,930
for all ships traveling
to the Gamma Quadrant.

1336
01:27:15,966 --> 01:27:17,458
With the arrival
of the <i>Enterprise</i>

1337
01:27:17,503 --> 01:27:19,838
the Cardassians
have left the area.

1338
01:27:21,913 --> 01:27:24,350
I suspect that the sight
of their warship

1339
01:27:24,386 --> 01:27:26,380
being towed
by a Federation runabout

1340
01:27:26,423 --> 01:27:28,222
took the heart
out of their fight.

1341
01:27:28,261 --> 01:27:31,166
We're not done
with the Cardassians yet...

1342
01:27:31,201 --> 01:27:34,698
not with the strategic
importance of that wormhole.

1343
01:27:34,742 --> 01:27:36,838
Well, you've put Bajor
on the map, Commander.

1344
01:27:36,881 --> 01:27:40,686
This will shortly become
a leading center of commerce

1345
01:27:40,723 --> 01:27:42,853
and of scientific exploration

1346
01:27:42,895 --> 01:27:46,961
and for Starfleet,
one of our most important posts.

1347
01:27:47,004 --> 01:27:49,532
Captain,
regarding our conversation

1348
01:27:49,577 --> 01:27:51,707
about someone to replace me...

1349
01:27:51,748 --> 01:27:53,274
Yes, I'm sorry
I haven't had time yet

1350
01:27:53,318 --> 01:27:55,687
to communicate that to Command.

1351
01:27:55,725 --> 01:27:58,823
I would prefer you ignore it,
sir.

1352
01:27:58,865 --> 01:28:01,861
I'm not sure that I can.

1353
01:28:01,905 --> 01:28:03,876
Are you certain
that's what you want?

1354
01:28:03,909 --> 01:28:05,708
Because we cannot afford to have

1355
01:28:05,748 --> 01:28:07,742
a commanding officer who is...

1356
01:28:07,785 --> 01:28:10,154
I'm certain, sir.

1357
01:28:21,150 --> 01:28:23,144
Good luck, Mr. Sisko.

1358
01:28:37,085 --> 01:28:41,049
So, where can someone practice
with his phaser around here?

1359
01:28:41,162 --> 01:28:43,395
New rules?

1360
01:28:43,433 --> 01:28:44,925
You can't cheat every customer

1361
01:28:44,970 --> 01:28:47,168
who walks through the door
anymore, Quark.

1362
01:28:47,209 --> 01:28:49,510
You are a community leader now.

1363
01:28:49,547 --> 01:28:51,346
Very well, very well.

1364
01:28:51,385 --> 01:28:55,292
Perhaps we could discuss
these new rules over a drink.

1365
01:28:57,499 --> 01:29:00,939
If you don't take
that hand off my hip

1366
01:29:00,974 --> 01:29:04,209
you'll never be able
to raise a glass with it again.

1367
01:29:10,696 --> 01:29:13,931
Oh, I love a woman in uniform.

1368
01:29:15,107 --> 01:29:16,770
...and three Frunalian
Science Vessels

1369
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:18,609
are requesting
permission to dock.

1370
01:29:18,648 --> 01:29:21,780
Problem is we've been
retrofitting the air locks, sir.

1371
01:29:21,821 --> 01:29:24,292
Half of them were damaged
during the move

1372
01:29:24,328 --> 01:29:25,592
and most of the others

1373
01:29:25,630 --> 01:29:28,432
when the Cardassians
blew out the fuel conduits.

1374
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:31,135
I guess they'll just have
to transport aboard...
