There you are.

How are they biting?

75
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,201
Small-fries.
Threw them back.

76

Want to go for a swim?

77
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,788
Don't have time.
We have to get ready.

78
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,831
It won't be so bad.

79
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,417
I've heard that Bajor
is a beautiful world.

80
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,502
So why can't we
live on the planet

81
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,255
instead of some
old space station?

82
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:58,757
The station is
in orbit of Bajor.

83
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,135
It will be just
like shore duty.

84
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,595
Will there be kids there?

85
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,013
Absolutely!

86
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,056
Lots of kids.

We're approaching
Deep Space 9, Commander.

00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,730
We'll be docking
in seven minutes.

91
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,940
Acknowledged.

92
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,111

93
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,783
What do you say?

94
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,910
We'll take the

96
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:39,756

107
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,262
I'm told the Cardassians
decided to have some fun

108
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,513
the day they left.

109
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,474
Four Bajorans
were killed

110
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:37,600
trying to protect
their shops.

111
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,727
Why hasn't anybody
cleaned this up?

112
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,188
We've got
all available personnel

113
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,857
assigned to repairing
primary systems, sir.

114
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,901
The Cardassians took
every component of value.

115
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,945
We're virtually defenseless.

116
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,864
I discussed this
with Major Kira

117
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,033
the attachÃ© assigned here by
the Bajoran government and...

118
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,993
Understood.

119
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,207
What about the civilians
who operated these shops?

120
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,125
A lot of them lost
everything they had.

121
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,793
A few are trying
to rebuild

122
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,795
but most are
packing up to leave.

123
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:15,514
Welcome,
Commander.

124
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:16,890
Please enter.

125
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,725
The Prophets await you.

126
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,687
Another time, perhaps.

127
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,440
Another time.

128
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,915
When my wife Keiko
saw our quarters

129
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,334
she started talking
about visiting her mother

130
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:45,793
in Kumomoto.

131
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,755
Sir, I wouldn't allow
the boy to go roaming.

132
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,924
We're still having
some security problems.

133
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,885
Dad, there is nothing
to sleep on in there

134
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,678
except for a cushion
on the floor.

135
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,556
Well, we can get
you a real bunk

136
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:58,848
off the<i> Enterprise.</i>

137
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,683
I almost forgot.

138
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,893
Captain Picard

139
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,186

140
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,687

141
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,774
Any word on our science
and medical officers yet?

142
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,984
They're expected
tomorrow.

143
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,320
Jake, I want you
to stay here

144
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,072
till I come back.

145
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,908
Is<i> this</i> the food replicator?

146
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,410
I'm afraid
they're all off-line.

147
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,370
There's plenty
of emergency rations.

148
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,371
I could send some down.

149
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,331
Dad...

150
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,838
We're going to have
to rough it

151
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:33,841
until we get things
up and running, Jake, okay?

152
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,302
(<i> softly</i> ):
Okay.

153
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,053
"Okay."

(<i> murmur of voices</i> )

155
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,452
I'd like to ask
the designer

156
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:03,121
what he was thinking about
when they built this place.

157
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,458
I still haven't been able
to find an ODN access.

158
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,876
That's the Prefect's
office up there.

159
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:12,130
So all others have
to look up with respect.

160
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,174
Cardassian architecture.
Yes, sir.

161
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,135
Major Kira's
been using it.

162
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:21,556
Is it my imagination
or is it unusually warm?

163
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:25,310
The environmental controls
in Ops are stuck at 32 C.

164
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,853
We're working on it.

165
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:31,608
(<i> muffled argument</i> )

166
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,151
(<i> sighing</i> )

167
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:36,279
I guess it's time
to meet Major Kira.

168
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,574
Sir, have you ever served
with any Bajoran women?

169
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,201
No. Why?

170
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,244
I was just wondering, sir.

171
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,788
KIRA:
They've become meaningless.

172
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,249
MAN (<i> on viewscreen</i> ):
I just don't agree, Kira.

173
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,335
You are throwing
it all away.

174
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,670
All of you!

175
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,338
You're being a fool!

176
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,798
Well, then don't ask
my opinion next time.

177
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:59,344
Yes?

178
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,471
I'm Benjamin Sisko.

179
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,640
I suppose you want the office.

180
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,267
Well, I thought
I'd say hello first

181
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,644
and<i> then</i> take the office

182
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,937
but we could do it
in any order you'd like.

183
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:12,940
Hello.

184
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,069
Is something bothering you,
Major?

185
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,778
You don't want to ask me that,
Commander.

186
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,239
Why not?

187
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,990
Because I have the bad habit
of telling the truth

188
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,368
even when people
don't want to hear it.

189
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,327
Perhaps I want

190
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,828
to hear it.

191
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,959
I don't believe the Federation
has any business being here.

192
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,462
The provisional government
disagrees with you.

193
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,632
The provisional government and I
don't agree on a lot of things

194
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,551
which is probably
why they sent me

195
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,010
to this godforsaken place.

196
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:46,099
I have been fighting
for Bajoran independence

197
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,727
since I was old enough
to pick up a phaser.

198
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,604
We finally drive
the Cardassians out

199
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,355
and what do our
new leaders do?

200
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:55,483
They call up the Federation
and invite them right in!

201
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,444
The Federation
is only here to help...

202
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,153
Help us.
Yes, I know.

203
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:03,533
The Cardassians said
the same thing 60 years ago.

204
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,159
Major, when I was ordered here

205
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,454
I requested a Bajoran national
as my First Officer.

206
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,038
It made sense.

207
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,832
It still does, at least to me.

208
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,377
Now, you and I are going
to have to find some way to...

209
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,630
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

210
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,382
MAN:
Yes, Major?

211
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,926
Odo, are you reading something
at A-14?

212
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,095
My security array
has been down for two hours.

213
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,472
I'll meet you there.

214
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,101
We've been having
a lot of break-ins lately.

215
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,895
No need for you
to come along, Commander.

216
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,530
(<i> whispering</i> ):
Hurry up!

217
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,494
Now!

218
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,497
Now!

219
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,761
ODO:
All right!
Just stand where you are!

220
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,264
(<i> growling</i> )

221
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,516
KIRA:
Hold it!

222
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,569
(<i> quizzical whimper</i> )

223
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:28,909
That's enough!

224
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,370
Who the hell are you?

225
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,538
Odo,

226
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,498
this is our new
Starfleet Commander.

227
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,799
I don't allow weapons
on the Promenade.

228
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,217
That includes phasers.

229
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,426
Nog?

230
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,886
What's going on?

231
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,684
The boy's
in a lot of trouble.

232
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:57,230
Commander, my name is Quark.

233
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,150
I used to run the local
gambling establishment.

234
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,571
This is my brother's boy.

235
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,614
(<i> snarling</i> )
(<i> hissing</i> )

236
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,449
Surely, you can see
he has only...

237
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,160
a peripheral involvement
in all this.

238
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,414
We're scheduled
to depart tomorrow.

239
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,291
If we could be permitted
to take him,

240
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,419
I promise you,
he will be severely...

241
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,045
That won't
be possible.

242
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,714
Take him to the brig.

243
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,932
Quark probably
sent the two of them here

244
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,810
to steal the ore samples
in the first place.

245
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,605
Major, there's a
Ferengi legal tradition.

246
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,481
It's called
plea bargaining.

247
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,941
I might let the boy go

248
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,903
but I want something
in exchange from Mr. Quark--

249
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:46,654
something very important.

250
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,782
O'Brien to Commander Sisko.

251
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,157
Go ahead.

252
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,827
Sir, the<i> Enterprise</i>
hailed us again.

253
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:55,496
Captain Picard
is waiting to see you.

254
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,290
Acknowledged.

255
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,917
This won't take long.

256
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,557
(<i> door chimes</i> )

257
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:15,892
Come.

258
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:19,145
Commander, yes,
please come in.

259
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,149
Welcome to Bajor.

260
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,485
It's been a long time,
Captain.

261
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,655
Have we met before?

262
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:32,241
Yes, sir.
We met in battle.

263
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,829
I was on the<i> Saratoga</i>
at Wolf 359.

264
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,714
I assume
that you have been briefed

265
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:50,844
on the events leading
to the Cardassian withdrawal.

266
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,512
Yes, sir.

267
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,932
I understand they spent
the last half century

268
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,267
robbing the planet
of every valuable resource

269
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,560
before abandoning it.

270
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,270
They've left the Bajorans

271
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,440
without a means
of being self-sustaining.

272
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,151
The relief efforts
we've been coordinating

273
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,362
are barely adequate.

274
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,450
I...

275
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,370
I've come to know
the Bajorans.

276
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,916
I'm... a strong proponent

277
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,877
for their entry
into the Federation.

278
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,419
Is it going to happen?

279
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,087
Not easily.

280
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,799
The ruling parties are
at each other's throats.

281
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,718
Factions that were united
against the Cardassians

282
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,636
have resumed old conflicts.

283
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,930
Sounds like they're not ready.

284
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,265
Your job is to do everything

285
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,768
short of violating
the Prime Directive

286
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,395
to make sure that they are.

287
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,486
I have been...

288
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,488
made aware by Starfleet

289
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:56,450
of your objections
to this assignment.

290
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,370
I... I would have thought

291
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,082
that after three years spent
at the Utopia Planitia Yards

292
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,876
that you would be
ready for a change.

293
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:05,960
I have a son

294
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,087
that I'm raising alone,
Captain.

295
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,673
This is not
the ideal environment.

296
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,633
Unfortunately,
as Starfleet officers

297
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,802
we do not always have the luxury

298
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,930
to serve
in an ideal environment.

299
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,305
I realize that, sir

300
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,433
and I'm investigating
the possibility

301
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,936
of returning to Earth
for civilian service.

302
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,774
Then perhaps Starfleet Command

303
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,902
should be considering
a replacement for you.

304
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:33,029
That's probably a good idea.

305
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,031
I'll look into it.

306
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,824
In the meantime, however...

307
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,827
In the meantime,
I will do the job

308
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:43,623
I've been ordered to do
to the best of my ability,<i> sir.</i>

309
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,045
Dismissed.

310
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,385
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

311
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,139
(<i> murmur of voices</i> )

312
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,016
(<i> whir of power tools</i> )

313
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,187
It's really quite
simple, Quark.

314
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,731
You're not
going to leave.

315
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,608
Not going to leave?

316
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,569
But we're packed
and ready to go.

317
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,071
Unpack.

318
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,782
I don't understand,
Commander.

319
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,993
Why would you want me to stay?

320
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,744
I'm curious myself.

321
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:24,664
The man is a
gambler and a thief.

322
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,124
I'm not a thief.

323
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,875
<i>You</i> are a thief.

324
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:31,378
If I am, you haven't
been able to prove it

325
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:32,546
for four years.

326
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,840
Please.

327
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,925
My officers,
the Bajoran engineers

328
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,551
all their families

329
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,262
depend on the shops
and services of this Promenade.

330
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,765
If people like
you abandon it

331
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:45,935
this is going to
become a ghost town.

332
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,813
We need someone to
step forward and say

333
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,941
"I'm staying.
I'm rebuilding."

334
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,360
We need a community leader

335
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,738
and it's going to be...
<i>you,</i> Quark.

336
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,532
(<i> boisterous laughter</i> )

337
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,617
Community leader.

338
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,494
ODO:
Seems
reasonable.

339
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:07,123
You have all the character
references of a politician.

340
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:11,836
How could I possibly
operate my establishment

341
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:14,839
under Starfleet
rules of conduct?

342
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,175
This is still a Bajoran station.

343
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:19,343
We're just here to administrate.

344
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,095
You run honest games

345
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,931
you won't have any problems
from me.

346
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:27,768
Commander, I've made a career
out of knowing when to leave

347
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,896
and this Bajoran
provisional government

348
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:33,566
is far too provisional
for my taste

349
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,110
and when governments fall

350
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:40,740
people like me
are lined up and shot.

351
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,658
There is that risk...

352
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:48,664
but, then,
you are a gambler, Quark.

353
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,249
<i>And</i> a thief.

354
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,960
SISKO:
You know, Quark,
that poor boy

355
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,046
is about to spend
the best years of his life

356
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,839
in a Bajoran prison.

357
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,011
I'm a father myself.

358
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:07,141
I know what your brother
must be going through.

359
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,810
The boy should be
with his family

360
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,812
not in some
cold jail cell.

361
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,898
Think about it.

362
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:16,067
It's up to you.

363
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,783
You know, at first

364
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:28,037
I didn't think
I was going to like him.

365
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,093
Major?

366
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:49,016
Everyone else is busy
repairing the primary systems.

367
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,684
I suppose Starfleet officers

368
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,146
aren't used to getting
their hands dirty.

369
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,829
In the refugee camps

370
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,998
we learned to do
whatever needed to be done.

371
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,624
Didn't matter who you were.

372
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:21,048
I was just talking
with our good
neighbor, Quark.

373
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:25,094
He's laying odds
that the government's
going to fall.

374
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:28,681
Quark knows a good bet
when he hears one.

375
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,767
This government
will be gone in a week,
and so will you.

376
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:35,521
What happens
to Bajor then?

377
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,148
Civil war.

378
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,112
You think
it's inevitable?

379
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:46,324
The only one who can
prevent it is Opaka.

380
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:48,534
Opaka?

381
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,577
Our spiritual leader.

382
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,955
She's known as the Kai.

383
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:56,209
Our religion

384
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:59,337
is the only thing that
holds my people together.

385
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:02,380
If she would call for
unity, they'd listen.

386
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,092
Leaders of all the factions
have tried to get to her

387
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,510
but she lives
in seclusion

388
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,470
rarely sees anyone.

389
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,599
Commander...

390
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,393
it is time.

391
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:51,264
(<i> birds chirping</i> )

392
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:53,515
(<i> distant chanting</i> )

393
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,913
I apologize for the condition
in which we greet you.

394
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:17,497
The Cardassians?

395
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:20,418
Your arrival has been
greatly anticipated.

396
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:28,175
Have you ever explored
your<i> pagh,</i> Commander?

397
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,303
<i>Pagh?</i>

398
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:34,181
A Bajoran draws courage
from his spiritual life.

399
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,725
Our life-force...

400
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,022
our<i> pagh...</i>

401
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,692
is replenished by the Prophets.

402
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:48,404
Breathe.
(<i> coughs</i> )

403
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,448
Kai Opaka,
if we could discuss...

404
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:51,865
Breathe!

405
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:59,165
Ironic.

406
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,964
One who does not wish to be
among us is to be the Emissary.

407
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,259
Please, come with me.

408
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,033
You are correct that Bajor
is in great jeopardy

409
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:36,494
but it is the threat
to our spiritual life

410
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:37,911
that far outweighs
any other.

411
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,538
Perhaps, but I am
powerless until...

412
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:41,874
Commander.

413
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:51,384
I cannot give you
what you deny yourself.

414
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:53,302
I'm sorry?

415
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:56,596
Look for solutions
from within, Commander.

416
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:59,058
Come with me.

417
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,775
What is it?

418
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,196
The Tear of the Prophet.

419
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:24,582
What the hell?

420
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,463
Opaka?

421
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,469
Ah... ow!

422
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:41,058
Hey!

423
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:44,103
I'm sorry.
It's just that this...

424
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,438
Jen?

425
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:46,855
Yes?

426
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,774
Jennifer?

427
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,234
I'm sorry.

428
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:53,237
Did we meet last night
at George's party?

429
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,030
George?

430
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,076
Jennifer...

431
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,372
Wait a minute.

432
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,165
This is impossible.

433
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,084
Are you okay?

434
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:08,419
I know this place.

435
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:10,588
This is Gilgo Beach,
where we met.

436
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:12,756
We met here before?

437
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:18,011
I was carrying
three lemonades...

438
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,556
The sand was burning my feet

439
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:24,935
and I stopped here... to...

440
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:26,145
Ow!

441
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:31,358
Do you realize
how incredible this is?

442
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:36,280
No, of course you don't. I--

443
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,120
Jennifer...

444
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:47,958
have a lemonade.

445
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:56,425
I'm afraid I don't accept drinks
from strange men on the beach.

446
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,233
So tell me the truth.

447
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:16,403
Have we really met before?

448
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,946
No.

449
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,202
Then how do you
know my name?

450
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,412
I... uh...

451
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,664
George told me

452
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:28,999
at the party.

453
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:32,628
Are you going
to tell me your name?

454
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,338
Oh, Ben Sisko.

455
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:36,882
I just graduated
from Starfleet Academy.

456
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,635
I'm waiting for
my first posting.

457
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:42,221
Oh, a junior officer.

458
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,473
Yeah.

459
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,016
My mother warned me

460
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,352
to watch out
for junior officers.

461
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:51,813
Your mother is
going to adore me.

462
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:54,567
You're awfully sure
of yourself.

463
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,652
It's not every day

464
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,987
you meet the girl
you're going to marry.

465
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,910
Do you use this routine
a lot with women?

466
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:09,039
No. Never before,
and never again.

467
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,087
Sure.

468
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,714
How about letting me

469
00:29:16,714 --> 00:29:18,674
cook dinner for you tonight?

470
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:19,966
My father

471
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,885
was a gourmet chef.

472
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:25,180
I will make for you
his famous aubergine stew.

473
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,017
I don't know.

474
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,604
You're supposed to say, "Yes!"

475
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:34,898
I'll probably be sorry.

476
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,531
Jennifer...!

477
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:58,756
Nine Orbs, like this one,
have appeared in the skies

478
00:29:58,756 --> 00:30:01,300
over the past 10,000 years.

479
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,719
The Cardassians
took the others.

480
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:06,346
You must find
the Celestial Temple

481
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,681
before they do.

482
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,433
The Celestial Temple?

483
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:13,103
Tradition says the Orbs
were sent by the Prophets

484
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:14,521
to teach us.

485
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:18,358
What we have learned
has shaped our theology.

486
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:23,947
The Cardassians will do<i> anything</i>
to decipher their powers.

487
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:27,367
If they discover
the Celestial Temple

488
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,119
they could destroy it.

489
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:33,999
What makes you think
I can find your temple?

490
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,007
This will help you.

491
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,134
Kai Opaka...

492
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:45,594
I can't unite my people

493
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:48,096
till I know the Prophets
have been warned.

494
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:52,267
You will find the Temple--

495
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,729
not for Bajor,
not for the Federation

496
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,897
but for your own<i> pagh.</i>

497
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:00,233
It is quite simply, Commander

498
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:03,487
the journey you have
always been destined to take.

499
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,634
What?

500
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:31,473
I was just thinking...

501
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,809
how much you look like your mom.

502
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,608
Kira to Sisko.

503
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,942
Go ahead.

504
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:45,571
Sorry to disturb you,
Commander

505
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:48,824
but there's something on the
Promenade you might want to see.

506
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,075
On my way.

507
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:02,170
(<i> distant conversation</i>
<i>and laughter</i> )

508
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,114
Step up, step up.

509
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,867
Fortune's fates
are with you today, friends.

510
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:32,910
(<i> loud cheers</i> )

511
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,286
Dabo!

512
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,496
WOMAN:
Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes!

513
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,707
That's fine.

514
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,876
I'll be right back.

515
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,890
What will you
have, Commander?

516
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,600
How's the local synthale?

517
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,685
You won't like it.

518
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,062
I love the Bajorans.

519
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:04,190
Such a deeply
spiritual culture

520
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:07,152
but they make a dreadful ale.

521
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:11,740
Never trust ale
from a god-fearing people

522
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,033
or a Starfleet Commander

523
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,954
that has one
of your relatives in jail.

524
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,541
WOMAN:
Dabo!

525
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,877
(<i> people groaning</i> )

526
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:28,340
SISKO:
<i>Station Log, Stardate 46390.1.</i>

527
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,509
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> has been ordered</i>
<i>to the Lapolis system.</i>

528
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,845
<i>They're scheduled to depart</i>
<i>at 0500 hours</i>

529
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:35,347
<i>after off-loading</i>
<i>three runabout-class vessels.</i>

530
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,933
<i>Meanwhile, our medical</i>
<i>and science officers</i>

531
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,936
<i>are arriving,</i>
<i>and I'm looking forward</i>

532
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:43,563
<i>to a reunion</i>
<i>with a very old friend.</i>

533
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,857
Commander, if you'd like me

534
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:46,024
to give them a tour
of the station...

535
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,609
You and Dr. Bashir
go ahead.

536
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:48,861
I'm afraid I have to put

537
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:50,403
Lieutenant Dax
to work right away.

538
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,322
Jadzia...

539
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:53,991
uh...

540
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:56,660
maybe we could...

541
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,371
get together later
for dinner...

542
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:02,666
or... or... or...
or a... or a drink?

543
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,501
I'd be delighted.

544
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,756
He's a little young
for you, isn't he?

545
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,800
He's 27. I'm 28.

546
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,635
328, maybe.

547
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:16,847
Did you tell him about
that slug inside of you?

548
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:18,223
Yes, Benjamin.

549
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,641
He knows I'm a Trill.

550
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:21,184
He finds it fascinating.

551
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,520
He's never met
a joined species before.

552
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,981
I wonder if he'd
been as fascinated

553
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,066
if you still looked
the way you did

554
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,359
the last time I saw you.

555
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,278
Perhaps not.

556
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:35,657
Whew.
This is going to take
some getting used to.

557
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,075
Don't be ridiculous.

558
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,077
I'm still the same old Dax...

559
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,328
more or less.

560
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:46,167
I'm afraid we've had
some security problems.

561
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:49,713
Looks like looters
got in here.

562
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,924
Oh, this will be perfect.

563
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:53,926
Real...

564
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:56,636
<i>frontier</i> medicine.

565
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,931
Frontier medicine?

566
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:03,393
Major, I had my choice
of any job in the fleet.

567
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:04,895
Did you?

568
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:06,897
I didn't want
some cushy job

569
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:08,398
or a research grant.

570
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:09,983
I wanted this--

571
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:12,193
the farthest reaches
of the galaxy.

572
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:15,072
One of the most remote
outposts available.

573
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,907
This is where the adventure is.

574
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:19,117
This is where heroes are made.

575
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:23,329
Right here,
in the wilderness.

576
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:28,710
This "wilderness"
is my home.

577
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,045
Well, I-I-I didn't mean...

578
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:31,838
The Cardassians
left behind

579
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,799
a lot of injured people,
<i>Doctor.</i>

580
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:35,092
You can make yourself useful

581
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:36,551
by bringing your
Federation medicine

582
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,095
to the<i> natives.</i>

583
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:41,222
Oh, you'll find them a
friendly, simple folk.

584
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,393
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

585
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,353
(<i> sighs</i> )

586
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,483
SISKO:
We do have one advantage.

587
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:54,778
The monks have been studying
these things for 10,000 years.

588
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,321
I've had
our computers set up

589
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,657
to interface with their
historical data banks.

590
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,533
That should give
us something.

591
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,869
Soon as possible, Dax.

592
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:06,665
The eight other Orbs
are probably in some
Cardassian laboratory

593
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:09,876
being turned upside down
and inside out.

594
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,422
Benjamin...

595
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,966
I was happy
when I heard

596
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:17,425
you accepted this assignment.

597
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,927
I'd been worried about you.

598
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:22,514
It's good to see you, too...
old man.

599
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,187
Computer, create a data base

600
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,024
for all historical references
to the Orbs

601
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:33,566
including all reports

602
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:36,235
of any unexplained phenomena
in Bajoran space.

603
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,612
Time parameters?

604
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,656
Ten millennia.

605
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:41,282
Initializing data base.

606
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:45,453
Requested function will require
two hours to complete.

607
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,020
Curzon.

608
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,444
(<i> gasps</i> )

609
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:03,073
(<i> breathing heavily</i> )

610
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:39,734
The Captain's
in the ready room, Chief.

611
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,779
Should I tell him
you're here?

612
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:43,989
Oh, that's okay.

613
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:45,198
Thanks.

614
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:01,589
Transport me to the
Ops pad, Maggie.

615
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,799
Yes, sir.

616
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,013
Mr. O'Brien?

617
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:11,308
I understand that I just
missed you on the Bridge.

618
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:13,268
Yes, sir.

619
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:17,730
I... I didn't want
to disturb you, sir.

620
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,398
Ensign.

621
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,780
This is your favorite
transporter room, isn't it?

622
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,824
Number three, yes, sir.

623
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:31,036
You know, yesterday
I called down here

624
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:33,371
and I asked for you
without thinking.

625
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:38,251
It won't be quite the same.

626
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:41,838
It's just
a transporter room, sir.

627
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,845
Permission to
disembark, Captain.

628
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:51,306
Permission granted.

629
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,481
Energize.

630
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:32,013
Message coming in
from their Commander

631
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,306
Gul Dukat.

632
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:34,933
Dukat.

633
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:38,019
He used to be the Cardassian
Prefect of Bajor.

634
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:42,107
He's requesting permission
to come aboard to greet us.

635
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:45,610
Surely a coincidence
that the<i> Enterprise</i> just left.

636
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,987
Mr. O'Brien

637
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:51,408
tell Gul Dukat
I look forward to meeting him.

638
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,540
Good day, Commander.

639
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,670
Gul Dukat.

640
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,590
Excuse my presumption

641
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:12,762
but... this was my office
only two weeks ago.

642
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,808
I'm not used
to being

643
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,560
on this side of the desk.

644
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:25,608
I'll be honest with you,
Commander.

645
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:28,778
I miss this office.

646
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:31,697
I was not happy to leave it.

647
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,616
Drop by any time

648
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,160
you're feeling homesick.

649
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,246
You are very gracious.

650
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:42,250
And allow me to assure
you that we only want

651
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:46,129
to be helpful
in this difficult transition.

652
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:48,965
You're far
from the Federation fleet

653
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:51,676
alone in this remote outpost

654
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:54,762
with poor
defense systems.

655
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:58,057
Your Cardassian neighbors
will be quick to respond

656
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:01,186
to any problems you might have.

657
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:04,063
We'll try to keep the dog
off your lawn.

658
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:11,696
So... tell me,
what did you think of Kai Opaka?

659
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,365
I know you went

660
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:15,867
to the surface to see her.

661
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,953
I understand
you brought back an Orb.

662
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,498
We thought we had
all of them.

663
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:26,044
Perhaps we could have
an exchange of information--

664
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:28,004
pool our resources.

665
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:34,635
I don't know anything
about an Orb.

666
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,057
We will be in close proximity

667
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:42,060
should you wish
to reconsider my suggestion.

668
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,602
In the meantime

669
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:46,981
I assume you have no objection
to my men

670
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,650
enjoying the hospitality
of the Promenade.

671
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,948
Commander.

672
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:12,048
What do you know
about the Denorios Belt?

673
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:14,008
Your basic charged
plasma field--

674
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,761
no one gets anywhere near it
unless they have to.

675
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,012
In the 22nd century

676
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,931
a ship carrying
Kai Taluno

677
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,767
was disabled for several
days in the Denorios Belt

678
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:25,144
where he claims
he had a vision.

679
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,938
Let me guess.

680
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,524
He saw the Celestial Temple
of the Prophets.

681
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:30,858
Not quite.

682
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,528
But he did say
that the heavens opened up

683
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:35,530
and nearly swallowed his ship.

684
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:38,657
Are we reduced to chasing
metaphors to solve this?

685
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:40,493
That's not all.

686
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:44,497
At least five of the Orbs
were found in the Denorios Belt.

687
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:48,793
There were also 23 navigational
reports over the years

688
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:52,464
of unusually severe
neutrino disturbances

689
00:43:52,464 --> 00:43:54,215
in the same area.

690
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:57,093
I've correlated
all these reports

691
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:59,220
into one analysis grid.

692
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,514
Our Celestial Temple?

693
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:03,724
Worth a look...

694
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:07,728
but we've got Cardassians
on our back doorstep.

695
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,482
We need to get by them
undetected.

696
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,776
(<i> cheering loudly</i> )

697
00:44:21,618 --> 00:44:24,078
(<i> laughter and cheers</i> )

698
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,971
May we have
your attention please.

699
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:44,765
This establishment
is being closed.

700
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,725
What do you mean?

701
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:48,727
You can't do this.

702
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:50,896
If you have a problem, sir

703
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:53,774
you'll have to take it up
with Commander Sisko.

704
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,568
I intend to.

705
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:58,029
This is outrageous.

706
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:04,202
Friends, my apologies.

707
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:09,874
A minor misunderstanding
that will be rectified shortly.

708
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:15,672
Give them something
to put their winnings into.

709
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:44,909
Because we were winning
too much, of course.

710
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:48,246
Leave it to Starfleet
to ruin a fine day.

711
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,893
<i>Rio Grande</i> to Ops.

712
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,771
Initializing prelaunch systems.

713
00:46:54,771 --> 00:46:55,938
Confirmed,<i> Rio Grande.</i>

714
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:14,081
Scanners are picking up
fluctuations

715
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:17,460
in the Cardassian's
energy distribution net.

716
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:24,175
Their computers are crashing.

717
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:26,135
Shields and sensors are down.

718
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:27,512
Odo's done it.

719
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,305
Ops to<i> Rio Grande.</i>

720
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:30,765
You're in business.

721
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:32,684
Beginning launch sequence.

722
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,361
Odo's reached
the transport site.

723
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:44,654
Trying to lock on.

724
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:53,496
I've never done this
with a Cardassian transporter.

725
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,667
Damn it, what's the problem?

726
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:07,468
Nice work, Constable.

727
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,237
Approaching
grid perimeter.

728
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,989
Slowing
to one-quarter impulse.

729
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:33,118
Computer, give me visual,
bearing 23 mark 217.

730
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:36,414
Range-- 3,100 kilometers.

731
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:39,709
Sensors are picking up
unusually high proton counts.

732
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:42,378
SISKO:
Setting a new course
to those coordinates.

733
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:50,261
All external wave intensities
are increasing rapidly

734
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:52,555
but checking...

735
00:48:52,555 --> 00:48:55,266
Confirmed. There is no
corresponding increase

736
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:56,642
inside the cabin.

737
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,770
How is that possible?

738
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:07,486
Sensors are not functioning.

739
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,697
We've lost all contact
with the space station.

740
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:14,410
Scanners are reading
major subspace disruption

741
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,245
at their last known coordinates.

742
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:20,374
What the hell is happening
out there?

743
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,042
I don't know.

744
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:25,962
They're just gone.

745
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:34,639
Are your navigational readings
going crazy?

746
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:36,390
I'll recalibrate
when I have a moment.

747
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,058
Take your time.

748
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:47,902
Can you get a fix
on our coordinates?

749
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:49,153
There is a star

750
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:51,697
just under
five light years away.

751
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:53,699
No M-Class planets.

752
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,577
Computer, identify
closest star system.

753
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:58,746
Idran-- a ternary system

754
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,790
consisting
of twin O-type companions.

755
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:02,625
Idran?
That can't be right.

756
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:04,042
Computer,
basis of identification?

757
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:06,921
Idran is based
on the analysis conducted

758
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:08,380
in the 22nd century

759
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:11,467
by the Quadros-1 probe
of the Gamma Quadrant.

760
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:14,679
The Gamma Quadrant?!
70,000 light years from Bajor?

761
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:17,055
I'd say we just found our way
into a wormhole.

762
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:19,099
It's not like any wormhole
I've ever seen.

763
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,686
There were none
of the usual resonance waves.

764
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:23,354
Could this be how the Orbs

765
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:25,606
found their way
into the Bajoran system?

766
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:28,609
Not an unreasonable hypothesis.

767
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:30,402
If it's true

768
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:33,781
that would mean that this
has been here for 10,000 years.

769
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:35,491
Dax, we might
have just discovered

770
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:37,075
the first stable wormhole

771
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:38,494
known to exist.

772
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:40,663
Bring us about, Lieutenant.

773
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:50,756
I'm modifying the flight
program to compensate

774
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,383
for the spatial
discontinuities.

775
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,426
We should have
a smoother ride this time.

776
00:50:57,972 --> 00:51:00,182
Did you reduce impulse power?

777
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,934
No. Why?

778
00:51:01,934 --> 00:51:03,811
We're losing velocity.

779
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:12,236
Forward velocity
down to 80 kph.

780
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:14,780
Warning.
Impulse system overload.

781
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,991
Auto shutdown in 12 seconds.

782
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:18,617
Disengaging engines.

783
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:22,120
Velocity at 20 kph.

784
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,375
I'm picking up
atmosphere.

785
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:30,128
Inside a wormhole?

786
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:32,798
Capable of
supporting life.

787
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:39,304
We've just landed.

788
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,557
On what?

789
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:47,187
(<i> electrical crackling</i> )

790
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:48,689
(<i> deep rumbling</i> )

791
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:03,119
(<i> birds chirping</i> )

792
00:52:22,765 --> 00:52:24,433
It's beautiful.

793
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,937
You have a strange
eye for beauty, Dax.

794
00:52:27,937 --> 00:52:29,981
You don't think
this is one

795
00:52:29,981 --> 00:52:32,483
of the most idyllic settings
you've ever seen?

796
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:34,693
We are standing on a rock face.

797
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:37,571
Do you see the storms?

798
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:40,866
It's as clear
as a summer's day.

799
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:43,119
(<i> zapping whoosh</i> )

800
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,037
You see it, too?

801
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:46,455
Yes.

802
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:01,095
Low-level ionic pattern.

803
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:02,680
It's probing us.

804
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,724
Someone's idea
of shaking hands maybe.

805
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,029
I am Commander Benjamin Sisko

806
00:53:18,029 --> 00:53:20,948
of the United Federation
of Planets.

807
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:22,240
(<i> both yell</i> )

808
00:53:37,882 --> 00:53:38,966
Dax!

809
00:53:52,188 --> 00:53:55,066
(<i> grunting</i> )

810
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:15,086
(<i> pounding heartbeat</i> )

811
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,809
Another neutrino disruption.

812
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,145
Scanners are
picking up an object

813
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:35,606
near their last
known coordinates.

814
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:38,025
It isn't a ship.

815
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,485
Major, there's something
inside it--

816
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:42,362
some kind of life-form.

817
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:45,323
Are the Cardassian
sensors picking it up?

818
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:46,951
They should be
back on line by now.

819
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:49,078
We have to assume they
know everything we know.

820
00:54:49,078 --> 00:54:51,413
Yellow Alert.
Secure Ops.

821
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,665
Beam it aboard, Mr. O'Brien

822
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:56,585
but put it in a level-1
security field.

823
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:59,255
Aye, sir.
Locking on.

824
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:05,052
(<i> gasping</i> )

825
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:13,936
(<i> heartbeat</i> )

826
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:26,949
Who are you?

827
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,871
Who are you?!

828
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:35,082
It is corporeal!

829
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:36,875
A physical entity.

830
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,877
What?

831
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:40,712
What did you say?

832
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:44,216
It is responding
to visual and auditory stimuli.

833
00:55:44,216 --> 00:55:46,342
Linguistic
communication.

834
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:48,929
Yes, linguistic communication.

835
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:51,974
Are you capable
of communicating with me?

836
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:57,938
What... are you?

837
00:55:57,938 --> 00:56:00,232
My species is known as human.

838
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:03,652
I come from a planet
called Earth.

839
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:04,987
Earth?

840
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:08,782
This is what my
planet looks like.

841
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,408
You and I

842
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:13,453
are very different species.

843
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:16,414
It will take... time

844
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:18,959
for us to understand
one another.

845
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:24,173
What is this... time?

846
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:38,436
KIRA:
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46392.7.</i>

847
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:40,522
<i>We're preparing to launch</i>
<i>a rescue mission</i>

848
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:42,398
<i>to find Commander Sisko.</i>

849
00:56:42,398 --> 00:56:45,027
<i>But first, our navigational</i>
<i>sensors must be recalibrated</i>

850
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:48,113
<i>to work under the conditions</i>
<i>reported by Lieutenant Dax.</i>

851
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:51,116
It is no ordinary wormhole.

852
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:53,244
My analysis suggests

853
00:56:53,244 --> 00:56:56,747
that it isn't
even a natural phenomenon.

854
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:58,456
Not natural?

855
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:00,625
You mean it was
constructed?

856
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:03,628
It's very possible
whoever made the Orbs

857
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:05,964
also created this wormhole.

858
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:08,759
The Cardassians
are leaving their position

859
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:11,095
on a course toward
the Denorios Belt.

860
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:13,055
Mr. O'Brien

861
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:16,016
what would it take
to move this station

862
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:18,310
to the mouth
of the wormhole?

863
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:20,354
This isn't
a starship, Major.

864
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:23,690
We've got six working thrusters
to power us and that's it.

865
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:27,027
160 million-kilometer
trip would take
two months.

866
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:28,612
It has to be there tomorrow.

867
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:30,488
That's not possible, sir.

868
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:32,199
That wormhole
might just reshape

869
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:34,159
the future of
this entire quadrant.

870
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,246
The Bajorans<i> have</i>
to stake a claim to it

871
00:57:37,246 --> 00:57:39,998
and I have to admit
that claim would be
a lot stronger

872
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,667
if there's a Federation presence
to back it up.

873
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:45,212
Couldn't you modify
the subspace field output

874
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:47,131
of the deflector generators
just enough

875
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:50,092
to create a low-level field
around the station?

876
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:53,220
So we could lower
the inertial mass.

877
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,013
If you can make
the station lighter

878
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:57,724
those six thrusters
will be all the power we need.

879
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:01,019
This whole station
could break apart like
an egg if it doesn't work.

880
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:03,105
Even if it does work,
we're still going

881
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:05,732
to need help from Starfleet
once we get there.

882
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:08,110
The<i> Enterprise</i> is still
the nearest starship.

883
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:10,528
They could reach
us in two days.

884
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:13,865
We should advise Starfleet
that we will require
their assistance.

885
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,575
You have Ops, Mr. O'Brien.

886
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:17,619
Lieutenant, you're with me.

887
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:18,578
Aye, sir.

888
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,205
You too, Doc.

889
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:22,166
Time to be a hero.

890
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:23,834
Yes, sir!

891
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:40,142
Constable...
This is
a security matter.

892
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:41,685
I'm in charge
of security.

893
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:43,520
Security here,
on the station.

894
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,440
I cannot justify taking
you into this wormhole.

895
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,650
We have no idea what we're
dealing with in there.

896
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:53,405
It could be hostile...
Major, I was found
in the Denorios Belt.

897
00:58:53,405 --> 00:58:55,699
I don't know where I came from--

898
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:58,618
no idea if there are
any others like me.

899
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:00,120
All my life,
I've been forced

900
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,913
to pass myself off
as one of you

901
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:04,708
always wondering
who I really am.

902
00:59:06,335 --> 00:59:08,295
Well, the answers
to a lot of my questions

903
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:10,797
may be somewhere on
the other side of that wormhole.

904
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:17,846
You coming?

905
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:35,489
(<i> heartbeat</i> )

906
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:38,658
The creature must be destroyed
before it destroys us.

907
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,118
It is malevolent.

908
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:42,662
Aggressive.

909
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:44,331
Adversarial.

910
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:46,166
It must be destroyed.

911
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:47,751
I am not your enemy.

912
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:50,045
I was sent here by the people
<i>you</i> contacted.

913
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:51,296
Contacted?

914
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:53,840
With your devices--
your Orbs.

915
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,510
We seek contact
with other life-forms

916
00:59:56,510 --> 01:00:00,013
not corporeal creatures
who annihilate us.

917
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:03,600
I have not come
to annihilate anyone.

918
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,269
Destroy it now.

919
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:11,442
My species respects life
above all else.

920
01:00:11,442 --> 01:00:14,152
Can you say the same?

921
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:20,284
I do not understand the threat
that I bring to you

922
01:00:20,284 --> 01:00:23,287
but I am not
your enemy.

923
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:25,830
Allow me to prove it.

924
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:27,291
Prove it?

925
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:29,251
It can be argued

926
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:32,504
that a human is ultimately
the sum of his experiences.

927
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:34,131
Experiences...

928
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:35,799
what is this?

929
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:37,426
Memories.

930
01:00:37,426 --> 01:00:39,470
Events from my past

931
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:41,430
like this one.

932
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:43,056
Past?

933
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:45,476
Things that happened before now.

934
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,982
You have absolutely no idea
what I'm talking about.

935
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:54,943
What comes before now
is no different

936
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:59,114
than what is now,
or what is to come.

937
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:01,617
It is one's existence.

938
01:01:01,617 --> 01:01:07,581
Then, for you,
there is no linear time.

939
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:10,750
Linear time-- what is this?

940
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,420
My species lives
in one point in time

941
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:16,381
and once we move
beyond that point

942
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:18,342
it becomes the past.

943
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:21,345
The future, all that
is still to come,

944
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:23,597
does not exist yet for us.

945
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:25,474
Does not exist yet?

946
01:01:25,474 --> 01:01:27,851
That is the nature
of linear existence

947
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:31,062
and if you examine
it more closely

948
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:33,982
you will see that you
do not need to fear me.

949
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:47,996
COMPUTER:
Partial field established.

950
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:50,374
Instability at 12%.

951
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:52,167
Partial field?

952
01:01:55,671 --> 01:01:58,131
Is station's inertial mass
low enough to break orbit?

953
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,008
Procedure is not recommended.

954
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:02,177
Damn it, I didn't ask
for an opinion.

955
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:04,971
Just tell me whether or not
we can get enough thrust

956
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,973
with only a partial field
established.

957
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:08,392
Affirmative.

958
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:09,643
All right. Thank you.

959
01:02:11,478 --> 01:02:14,398
Initiate transit mode,
three-axis stabilization.

960
01:02:14,398 --> 01:02:16,066
Aye, sir.

961
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,359
Engage thrusters.

962
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:30,288
Warning.
Field integrity declining.

963
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:32,374
Instability at 21%.

964
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:35,001
We've got to close that gap
in the field

965
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:37,421
or we'll tear ourselves
into a million pieces.

966
01:02:37,421 --> 01:02:41,007
Warning. Subspace field
collapse in 60 seconds.

967
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:44,720
Computer, transfer energy
from the inertial dampers

968
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,430
to reinforce the subspace field.

969
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:48,139
Procedure is not recommended.

970
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:50,100
Damn it, transfer the energy.

971
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,560
Unable to comply.

972
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:54,020
Level-1 safety protocols
have canceled request.

973
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,480
Canceled?!

974
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,650
Warning. Subspace field
collapse in 30 seconds.

975
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:00,860
I'm going to transfer it
manually.

976
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:04,406
On my mark, redirect the flow
to the deflectors

977
01:03:04,406 --> 01:03:06,408
and keep the power balanced.
Aye, sir.

978
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:08,952
Field collapse in 15 seconds.

979
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:11,663
Now.

980
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:25,343
Field energy
now within flight tolerances.

981
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,053
(<i> exhaling deeply</i> )

982
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:29,222
Good work, sir.

983
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:38,189
Computer, you and I need
to have a little talk.

984
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:50,368
The Cardassian warship
is in visual range.

985
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:51,703
On screen.

986
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:56,583
They're headed right to it.

987
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:58,627
Well, they've got to listen
to reason, haven't they?

988
01:03:58,627 --> 01:04:00,671
When we warn them what could
happen if they go in there.

989
01:04:00,671 --> 01:04:02,714
Doctor, most people,
in my experience

990
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:05,509
wouldn't know reason if it
walked up and shook their hand.

991
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:08,512
You can count Gul Dukat
among them.

992
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:12,432
This is the Federation
Ship<i> Yangtzee Kiang.</i>

993
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:13,975
Major Kira Nerys in command.

994
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:16,645
Yes, Major.

995
01:04:16,645 --> 01:04:19,481
Gul Dukat, we know you're headed
for the wormhole.

996
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:21,024
Wormhole?

997
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:24,194
What wormhole is that?

998
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:27,030
I strongly suggest
you do not proceed.

999
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:30,367
We encountered
a hostile life-form inside.

1000
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:33,286
Perhaps they will be
less hostile to Cardassians

1001
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:34,621
than to humans.

1002
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:36,206
Dukat

1003
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:37,791
these people are trying

1004
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,584
to save you
from a lot of trouble.

1005
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:40,918
Really?

1006
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:43,296
And I suppose
you're going to tell me

1007
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:45,507
that these are not
the life-forms

1008
01:04:45,507 --> 01:04:47,175
that have sent the Orbs

1009
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:49,969
or that your Commander Sisko
is not negotiating

1010
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:52,013
for their technology.

1011
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,558
I thank you for your concern

1012
01:04:54,558 --> 01:04:59,312
but I think we will see
for ourselves.

1013
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:06,277
So much for reason.

1014
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:11,115
Jennifer.

1015
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:24,713
Yes, that was her name.

1016
01:05:24,713 --> 01:05:26,964
She is part
of your existence.

1017
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:28,966
She is part of my past.

1018
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:30,886
She's no longer alive.

1019
01:05:30,886 --> 01:05:33,304
But she is part
of your existence.

1020
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:36,600
She<i> was</i> a most important
part of my existence

1021
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,560
but I lost her
some time ago.

1022
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,353
Lost?

1023
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:42,188
What is this?

1024
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:46,192
In a linear existence, we
can't go back to the past

1025
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:48,528
to get something
we left behind,

1026
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:52,699
so... it's lost.

1027
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:55,243
It is inconceivable
that any species

1028
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:57,412
could exist
in such a manner.

1029
01:05:57,412 --> 01:05:59,205
You are deceiving us.

1030
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:00,582
No.

1031
01:06:00,582 --> 01:06:02,250
This is the truth.

1032
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:05,754
This day, this...
this park...

1033
01:06:05,754 --> 01:06:11,468
it was almost 15 years
ago, far in the past.

1034
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:15,513
It was a day that was
very important to me--

1035
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:19,851
a day that shaped
every day that followed.

1036
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:24,230
That is the essence
of a linear existence.

1037
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:28,276
Each day affects the next.

1038
01:06:30,445 --> 01:06:32,405
(<i> children laughing</i> )

1039
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:40,789
Listen to it.

1040
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:43,541
To what?

1041
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:46,043
The sound of
children playing.

1042
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:48,546
What could be
more beautiful?

1043
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:51,174
So you like children.

1044
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:54,344
That almost sounds
like a domestic inquiry.

1045
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:57,472
I've heard Starfleet officers
don't want families

1046
01:06:57,472 --> 01:07:00,350
because they complicate
their lives.

1047
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:03,060
Starfleet officers
don't often find mates

1048
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:05,897
who want to raise families
on a starship.

1049
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:09,233
That almost sounds
like a domestic inquiry.

1050
01:07:09,233 --> 01:07:11,695
I think it was.

1051
01:07:35,886 --> 01:07:37,929
As corporeal entities,

1052
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:40,640
humans find physical
touch to cause pleasure.

1053
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:44,811
Pleasure...
what is this?

1054
01:07:46,938 --> 01:07:48,940
Good feelings.

1055
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,734
Happiness.

1056
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:55,864
<i>But this is</i>
<i>your existence.</i>

1057
01:07:55,864 --> 01:07:59,367
It's difficult
to be here--

1058
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:02,037
more difficult
than any other memory.

1059
01:08:02,037 --> 01:08:04,080
Why?

1060
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,582
Because...

1061
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:09,961
because this was the day...

1062
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:13,924
that I lost Jennifer.

1063
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:20,304
I don't want to be here.

1064
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:28,772
Then why do you exist here?

1065
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:33,777
I don't understand.

1066
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:36,195
You exist<i> here.</i>

1067
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:38,949
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

1068
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:48,291
What's wrong?

1069
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:50,209
What's happening?

1070
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:03,640
We should be reaching

1071
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,433
the wormhole coordinates
in two minutes.

1072
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:07,894
Slowing to one-third imp...

1073
01:09:26,997 --> 01:09:28,790
Are you still there?

1074
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:30,625
What just happened?

1075
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:32,627
More of your kind.

1076
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:34,504
Another ship...

1077
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:36,547
in the wormhole?

1078
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:39,676
Wormhole?
What is this?

1079
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:42,929
It is how we describe
the passage that
brought me here.

1080
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:44,055
It is terminated.

1081
01:09:44,055 --> 01:09:45,515
Terminated?

1082
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:47,183
Our existence is disrupted

1083
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,226
whenever one of you
enters the passage.

1084
01:09:49,226 --> 01:09:52,438
Your linear nature
is inherently destructive.

1085
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:53,815
You have no regard

1086
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:56,026
for the consequences
of your acts.

1087
01:09:56,026 --> 01:09:57,735
That's not true.

1088
01:09:57,735 --> 01:10:01,364
We're aware that every choice
we make has a consequence.

1089
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:04,325
But you claim you do not know
what it will be.

1090
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:05,576
We don't.

1091
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:07,078
<i>Then how can you take</i>

1092
01:10:07,078 --> 01:10:09,330
responsibility
for your actions?

1093
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:12,208
We use past experience
to help guide us.

1094
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,711
For Jennifer and me

1095
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:16,921
all the experiences
in our lives

1096
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:19,382
prepared us for the day
we met on the beach--

1097
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:23,094
helped us recognize
that we had a future together.

1098
01:10:23,094 --> 01:10:25,096
When we married,
we accepted

1099
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:27,515
all the consequences
of that act

1100
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:29,308
whatever they might be

1101
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:31,519
including the consequences
of you.

1102
01:10:31,519 --> 01:10:32,937
Me?

1103
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:34,605
My son Jake...

1104
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:36,733
The child with Jennifer.

1105
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:38,860
Yes.

1106
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:43,698
Linear... procreation?
Yes.

1107
01:10:43,698 --> 01:10:46,910
Jake is the continuation
of our family.

1108
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:49,662
The sound of children playing.

1109
01:10:51,122 --> 01:10:53,583
Aggressive.
Adversarial.

1110
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:56,293
Competition.
For fun!

1111
01:10:56,293 --> 01:10:59,047
It's a game that Jake
and I play on the holodeck.

1112
01:10:59,047 --> 01:11:01,298
It's called baseball.

1113
01:11:01,298 --> 01:11:03,342
Baseball?

1114
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:04,969
What is this?

1115
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:07,263
I was afraid you'd ask that.

1116
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:12,185
I throw this ball to you

1117
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:15,897
and this other player
stands between us with a bat--

1118
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:18,942
a stick-- and he...

1119
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:21,903
and he tries to hit the ball

1120
01:11:21,903 --> 01:11:24,739
in between these
two white lines.

1121
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:32,163
Oh.

1122
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:35,166
The rules aren't important.

1123
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:38,169
What's important is...

1124
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:40,588
it's linear.

1125
01:11:40,588 --> 01:11:42,715
Every time I throw this ball

1126
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:46,052
a hundred different things
can happen in a game.

1127
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:48,638
He might swing and miss,
he might hit it.

1128
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:51,557
The point is, you never know.

1129
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:53,268
You try to anticipate,

1130
01:11:53,268 --> 01:11:56,813
set a strategy
for all the possibilities

1131
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:59,356
as best you can, but in the end

1132
01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:02,235
it comes down to throwing
one pitch after another

1133
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:04,445
and seeing what happens.

1134
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:07,782
With each new consequence,
the game begins to take shape.

1135
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:10,451
And you have no idea
what that shape is

1136
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:12,036
until it is completed.

1137
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:13,579
That's right.

1138
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:15,706
In fact, the game
wouldn't be worth playing

1139
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:18,709
if we knew
what was going to happen.

1140
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:21,921
You<i> value</i> your ignorance
of what is to come?

1141
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:24,174
That may be
the most important thing

1142
01:12:24,174 --> 01:12:26,550
to understand about humans.

1143
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:30,638
It is the unknown
that defines our existence.

1144
01:12:30,638 --> 01:12:32,682
We are constantly searching

1145
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:34,976
not just for answers
to our questions

1146
01:12:34,976 --> 01:12:37,603
but for new questions.

1147
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:39,647
We are explorers.

1148
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:43,651
We explore our lives day by day,

1149
01:12:43,651 --> 01:12:45,486
and we explore the galaxy

1150
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:47,947
trying to expand
the boundaries of our knowledge

1151
01:12:47,947 --> 01:12:50,700
and<i> that</i> is why I am here--

1152
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:53,077
not to conquer you
with weapons

1153
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:56,331
or with ideas,

1154
01:12:56,331 --> 01:12:58,666
but to coexist...

1155
01:12:58,666 --> 01:13:00,501
and learn.

1156
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:04,755
<i>If all you say is true,</i>

1157
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:06,966
why do you exist<i> here?</i>

1158
01:13:20,688 --> 01:13:22,940
KIRA:
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>
<i>supplemental.</i>

1159
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:25,235
<i>We've rendezvoused</i>
<i>with the space station</i>

1160
01:13:25,235 --> 01:13:27,320
<i>at the former coordinates</i>
<i>of the wormhole.</i>

1161
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,405
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>our scans have revealed</i>

1162
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:32,909
<i>no trace of either the wormhole</i>
<i>or Dukat's ship.</i>

1163
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:34,577
<i>A few minutes ago</i>

1164
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:36,453
<i>three Cardassian warships</i>
<i>crossed the border</i>

1165
01:13:36,453 --> 01:13:38,373
<i>no doubt on their way</i>
<i>to search for Dukat.</i>

1166
01:13:38,373 --> 01:13:41,376
Mr. O'Brien, can you establish
a high-energy thoron field

1167
01:13:41,376 --> 01:13:43,336
before they get
into sensor range?

1168
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:45,588
I don't want them
to be able to scan

1169
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:47,506
our defense systems.
Aye, sir.

1170
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:49,550
They're hailing us.

1171
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:51,969
On screen.

1172
01:13:53,263 --> 01:13:55,139
I am Gul Jasad

1173
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:58,768
of the Cardassian guard,
Seventh Order.

1174
01:13:58,768 --> 01:14:00,978
Where is our warship?

1175
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:03,898
With any luck,
they're in the Gamma Quadrant

1176
01:14:03,898 --> 01:14:05,358
on the other side
of the wormhole.

1177
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:06,817
What wormhole?

1178
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:09,153
Our sensors show no indication

1179
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:11,406
of a wormhole in this sector.

1180
01:14:11,406 --> 01:14:13,824
That's because
it just collapsed.

1181
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:15,451
What?!

1182
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,828
We believe it was
artificially created.

1183
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:20,539
That may be why our
sensors never picked up

1184
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:22,541
any of the usual quantum
fluctuation patterns.

1185
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:27,338
You expect me to believe
that someone created a wormhole

1186
01:14:27,338 --> 01:14:30,300
and now conveniently
has disassembled it?

1187
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:33,136
KIRA:
That's exactly what I
expect you to believe.

1188
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:39,642
They're flooding subspace
with antilepton interference.

1189
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:42,186
It'll cut off
our communications
with Starfleet.

1190
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:43,896
They're powering up
their forward phasers.

1191
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:45,398
Red Alert.

1192
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:46,357
Shields up.

1193
01:14:46,357 --> 01:14:49,026
What shields?

1194
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:51,821
DAX:
They're hailing us again.

1195
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:54,407
Open the channel.

1196
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:59,078
We do not accept
your explanation.

1197
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:02,081
Somehow you have destroyed
our warship.

1198
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:05,084
Gul Jasad,
I assure you...

1199
01:15:05,084 --> 01:15:09,172
We demand the unconditional
surrender of this space station

1200
01:15:09,172 --> 01:15:12,342
or we will open fire.

1201
01:15:16,137 --> 01:15:17,721
I need at least a day

1202
01:15:17,721 --> 01:15:19,932
to make the necessary
preparations.

1203
01:15:22,393 --> 01:15:25,480
You have one hour.

1204
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:49,337
I can transfer
all available power

1205
01:15:49,337 --> 01:15:51,672
to establish partial shields
around critical areas

1206
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:53,716
but if they hit
the docking ring

1207
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:55,426
we'll sustain heavy damage.

1208
01:15:55,426 --> 01:15:58,054
Constable, if you
would coordinate

1209
01:15:58,054 --> 01:16:00,181
moving all personnel
to safer locations.

1210
01:16:03,518 --> 01:16:06,354
What was the last reported
position of the<i> Enterprise?</i>

1211
01:16:06,354 --> 01:16:08,605
DAX:
At least 20 hours away.

1212
01:16:08,605 --> 01:16:10,024
We've got to hold out

1213
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:11,359
till they get here.

1214
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:12,985
I can't believe
the Cardassians

1215
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:15,112
would ever attack
a Federation outpost.

1216
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:18,324
Doctor, you ever studied
your military history
of the border wars?

1217
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:21,327
Yes.
Ever heard
of the Setlik III massacre?

1218
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:23,162
I assume, Mr. O'Brien,
you would agree

1219
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:25,206
surrender is not
a preferable option.

1220
01:16:25,206 --> 01:16:27,500
You know what they do
to their prisoners, sir.

1221
01:16:34,257 --> 01:16:36,884
(<i> heartbeat</i> )

1222
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:47,811
What is the point of bringing me
back again to<i> this?</i>

1223
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:51,357
We do not bring you here.

1224
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:54,569
You bring<i> us</i> here.

1225
01:16:54,569 --> 01:16:56,820
You exist here.

1226
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:58,531
Then give me the power

1227
01:16:58,531 --> 01:17:01,700
to lead you somewhere
else--<i> anywhere</i> else.

1228
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:03,744
We cannot give you

1229
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:05,704
what you deny yourself.

1230
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:09,041
Look for solutions from within,
Commander.

1231
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:19,969
I was ready to die with her.

1232
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:21,845
Die... what is this?

1233
01:17:23,431 --> 01:17:24,765
The termination

1234
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:27,684
of their linear existence.

1235
01:17:40,448 --> 01:17:43,200
TACTICAL OFFICER:
<i>We've got to go now, sir.</i>

1236
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,535
Damn it!

1237
01:17:44,535 --> 01:17:47,163
We just can't leave her here!

1238
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:50,249
Oh! Oh, no!

1239
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:56,339
I never left this ship.

1240
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:58,382
You exist here.

1241
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:04,805
I...

1242
01:18:04,805 --> 01:18:06,932
exist here.

1243
01:18:22,657 --> 01:18:25,660
I don't know
if you can understand.

1244
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:27,786
I see her like this

1245
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:31,332
every time I close my eyes.

1246
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:34,460
In the darkness...

1247
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:37,880
in the blink of an eye

1248
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:41,800
I see her like this.

1249
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,679
None of your past experiences
helped prepare you

1250
01:18:44,679 --> 01:18:46,305
for this consequence.

1251
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:50,351
And I have never figured out
how to live without her.

1252
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:55,731
So you choose to exist here.

1253
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:02,405
It is not linear.

1254
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:05,991
No.

1255
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:08,411
It's not linear.

1256
01:19:32,602 --> 01:19:34,437
Oh...

1257
01:19:48,618 --> 01:19:51,161
Their lead ship is hailing us.

1258
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:53,748
Gul Jasad wants an answer.

1259
01:19:53,748 --> 01:19:55,541
Are you ready, Mr. O'Brien?

1260
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:57,293
Yes, sir.

1261
01:19:57,293 --> 01:19:59,920
When they penetrate
our thoron field

1262
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,965
it should raise a few
eyebrows over there.

1263
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:06,135
All right, then,
let's give them our answer.

1264
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:09,722
Fire six photon torpedoes
across Jasad's bow.

1265
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:12,600
We only<i> have</i> six photons, Major.

1266
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,852
We're not going to win this
battle with torpedoes, Chief.

1267
01:20:15,852 --> 01:20:17,896
Aye, sir.

1268
01:20:22,859 --> 01:20:25,154
An urgent hail
from Jasad.

1269
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:27,197
Looks like we got his attention.

1270
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:30,951
On screen.

1271
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:33,370
This is your answer?
You don't think

1272
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:36,039
Starfleet took command
of this space station

1273
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:38,208
without the ability
to defend it, do you?

1274
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:41,712
Defend it?
(<i> laughs</i> )

1275
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:46,801
Your space station
could not defend itself
against<i> one</i> Cardassian warship.

1276
01:20:46,801 --> 01:20:49,011
You're probably right, Jasad...

1277
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:54,684
and if you were dealing
with a Starfleet officer

1278
01:20:54,684 --> 01:20:56,727
they'd probably admit

1279
01:20:56,727 --> 01:21:00,314
we have a hopeless cause here.

1280
01:21:00,314 --> 01:21:04,360
But I am just a Bajoran
who's been fighting

1281
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:08,030
a hopeless cause
against the Cardassians

1282
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:10,991
all her life.

1283
01:21:10,991 --> 01:21:13,703
So if you want a war...

1284
01:21:13,703 --> 01:21:15,912
I'll give you one.

1285
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:24,797
Major.

1286
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:26,923
Remind me never
to get into a game

1287
01:21:26,923 --> 01:21:29,635
of Roladan Wild Draw
with you.

1288
01:21:42,189 --> 01:21:45,526
They were using a thoron field
to block our sensors

1289
01:21:45,526 --> 01:21:47,528
but we were able
to penetrate it.

1290
01:21:47,528 --> 01:21:50,072
What are their defenses?

1291
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:54,284
According to our scans,
an estimated 5,000 photons,

1292
01:21:54,284 --> 01:21:57,037
integrated phaser banks
on all levels.

1293
01:21:57,037 --> 01:21:59,623
When did they receive
these armaments?

1294
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:02,376
And how did they install
them without our knowledge?

1295
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:04,587
(<i> growls</i> )

1296
01:22:04,587 --> 01:22:09,800
Somehow they have created
a massive illusion

1297
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:12,636
of duranium shadows.

1298
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:15,598
What if it is<i> not</i> an illusion?
It is!

1299
01:22:15,598 --> 01:22:17,558
Why risk the confrontation?

1300
01:22:17,558 --> 01:22:18,601
The Fourth Order

1301
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:19,769
can be here
in a day.

1302
01:22:19,769 --> 01:22:22,479
So can Starfleet.

1303
01:22:27,109 --> 01:22:29,570
Their lead ship is sending out
a subspace message

1304
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:31,988
asking for reinforcements.
Yes!

1305
01:22:31,988 --> 01:22:34,742
Too soon for
a victory celebration, Doctor.

1306
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:37,202
Mr. O'Brien?

1307
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:38,537
The ships are
being deployed

1308
01:22:38,537 --> 01:22:40,915
in a standard
attack formation, sir.

1309
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:44,293
Battle stations.

1310
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:46,921
(<i> alarm bleeps</i> )

1311
01:22:51,675 --> 01:22:53,886
(<i> alarmed exclamations</i> )

1312
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:56,305
ODO:
Quickly, now.
Quickly, now.

1313
01:22:56,305 --> 01:22:57,681
Calmly, calmly.

1314
01:22:57,681 --> 01:22:59,475
Come along.

1315
01:23:00,726 --> 01:23:02,561
They may just be testing us.

1316
01:23:02,561 --> 01:23:05,188
I could run a pulse
compression wave

1317
01:23:05,188 --> 01:23:07,107
through the phaser banks--

1318
01:23:07,107 --> 01:23:09,944
put out a blast that will
make them think twice.

1319
01:23:09,944 --> 01:23:11,236
Do it.

1320
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,076
Damage report.

1321
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:19,578
Direct hit, level 14.

1322
01:23:19,578 --> 01:23:22,665
Empty storage bays.
No casualties.

1323
01:23:22,665 --> 01:23:25,375
Shields down to 27%.

1324
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:33,968
(<i> shouting and screaming</i> )

1325
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:52,068
A fuel conduit
has ruptured on the Promenade.

1326
01:23:52,068 --> 01:23:54,905
Can you divert
the main power flow?

1327
01:23:56,406 --> 01:23:57,449
The controls are locked.

1328
01:23:57,449 --> 01:23:59,576
Odo to Ops.
Go ahead.

1329
01:23:59,576 --> 01:24:01,328
I've got wounded people
down here!

1330
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:03,455
Have you seen that Doctor
of yours anywhere?

1331
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:04,874
I'm on my way.

1332
01:24:08,084 --> 01:24:10,420
I'm going to have to shut down
the primary power flow

1333
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:12,047
or the whole Promenade
will go up.

1334
01:24:13,382 --> 01:24:15,175
Bloody Cardassians!

1335
01:24:15,175 --> 01:24:17,386
I just got the damn thing fixed.

1336
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:23,308
(<i> woman moaning</i> )

1337
01:24:26,645 --> 01:24:29,023
(<i> moaning</i> )

1338
01:24:29,023 --> 01:24:31,817
Press there, hard.

1339
01:24:33,276 --> 01:24:36,196
Look, Doctor, maybe I should
find you someone...

1340
01:24:36,196 --> 01:24:39,700
Hold. It. There.

1341
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:43,412
(<i> instrument whirring</i> )

1342
01:24:51,169 --> 01:24:53,839
That should do it for a while.

1343
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:56,091
Shields are at 18%
and falling.

1344
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:58,176
I might still be able
to give you

1345
01:24:58,176 --> 01:25:00,012
one more phaser blast, Major.

1346
01:25:00,012 --> 01:25:01,847
No.

1347
01:25:01,847 --> 01:25:04,683
(<i> alarm bleeping</i> )

1348
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:16,278
Signal the lead Cardassian ship
that we will proceed with...

1349
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:19,364
Major, I'm picking up
a huge neutrino disturbance

1350
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:22,034
15 kilometers
off the forward docking ring.

1351
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:24,119
It's the wormhole.

1352
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:27,664
On screen.

1353
01:25:31,001 --> 01:25:32,836
Hail the lead ship.

1354
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:34,463
What did I tell
you, Jasad?

1355
01:25:34,463 --> 01:25:36,506
There's your wormhole!

1356
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,351
SISKO:
<i>Rio Grande</i> to DS9.

1357
01:25:48,351 --> 01:25:49,519
On screen.

1358
01:25:49,519 --> 01:25:50,938
Go ahead, Commander.

1359
01:25:50,938 --> 01:25:52,272
Sorry to be late, Major.

1360
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:54,399
Our friend Gul Dukat
had some problems

1361
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:56,110
on the other side
of the wormhole.

1362
01:25:56,110 --> 01:25:58,320
I see you've had
a few of your own.

1363
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,114
A few, Commander.

1364
01:26:00,114 --> 01:26:01,865
(<i> console beeping</i> )

1365
01:26:01,865 --> 01:26:05,035
Gul Dukat is signaling
his ships to disarm.

1366
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:07,203
Clear me for docking,
Mr. O'Brien.

1367
01:26:07,203 --> 01:26:08,497
Aye, sir.

1368
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:10,582
Cleared for Pad C.

1369
01:26:18,007 --> 01:26:20,676
(<i> buzz of conversation</i> )

1370
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:39,111
Casualties?

1371
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:42,781
13 injured, Commander,
and no fatalities.

1372
01:26:47,786 --> 01:26:49,746
Jake!

1373
01:26:50,747 --> 01:26:51,874
Dad!

1374
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:57,546
(<i> laughing</i> )

1375
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:05,929
<i>Station Log,</i>
<i>Commander Benjamin Sisko.</i>

1376
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:08,849
<i>Stardate 46393.1.</i>

1377
01:27:08,849 --> 01:27:10,684

1381
01:27:16,857 --> 01:27:18,650
<i>the Cardassians</i>
<i>have left the area.</i>

1382
01:27:20,694 --> 01:27:23,155
I suspect that the sight
of their warship

1383
01:27:23,155 --> 01:27:25,199
being towed by a
Federation runabout

1384
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:27,034
took the heart
out of their fight.

1385
01:27:27,034 --> 01:27:29,995
We're not done
with the Cardassians yet--

1386
01:27:29,995 --> 01:27:33,498
not with the strategic
importance of that wormhole.

1387
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:35,834
Well, you've put Bajor
on the map, Commander.

1388
01:27:35,834 --> 01:27:38,378
This will shortly become
a leading center

1389
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:41,715
of commerce
and of scientific
exploration

1390
01:27:41,715 --> 01:27:45,802
and for Starfleet,
one of our most important posts.

1391
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:48,430
Captain,
regarding our conversation

1392
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:50,557
about someone to replace me...

1393
01:27:50,557 --> 01:27:52,142
Yes, I'm sorry I
haven't had time yet

1394
01:27:52,142 --> 01:27:54,519
to communicate that to Command.

1395
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:57,689
I would prefer
you ignore it, sir.

1396
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:00,734
I'm not sure that I can.

1397
01:28:00,734 --> 01:28:02,736
Are you certain
that's what you want?

1398
01:28:02,736 --> 01:28:04,613
Because we cannot afford to have

1399
01:28:04,613 --> 01:28:06,448
a commanding
officer who is...

1400
01:28:06,448 --> 01:28:08,784
I'm certain, sir.

1401
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,755
Good luck, Mr. Sisko.

1402
01:28:35,811 --> 01:28:37,854
So, where can
someone practice

1403
01:28:37,854 --> 01:28:39,815
with his phaser
around here?

1404
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:42,192
QUARK:
New rules?

1405
01:28:42,192 --> 01:28:43,944
You can't cheat
every customer

1406
01:28:43,944 --> 01:28:45,862
who walks through the door
anymore, Quark.

1407
01:28:45,862 --> 01:28:48,406
You are a community
leader now.

1408
01:28:48,406 --> 01:28:50,159
Very well, very well.

1409
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:53,870
Perhaps we could discuss
these new rules over a drink.

1410
01:28:56,248 --> 01:28:59,542
If you don't take
that hand off my hip

1411
01:28:59,542 --> 01:29:02,838
you'll never be able
to raise a glass
with it again.

1412
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:12,139
Oh, I love a woman in uniform.

1413
01:29:13,974 --> 01:29:15,642
DAX:
...and three Frunalian
science vessels

1414
01:29:15,642 --> 01:29:17,477
are requesting
permission to dock.

1415
01:29:17,477 --> 01:29:20,730
Problem is we've been
retrofitting the air locks, sir.

1416
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:23,108
Half of them were damaged
during the move

1417
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:24,693
and most of the others

1418
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:27,321
when the Cardassians
blew out the fuel conduits.

1419
01:29:27,321 --> 01:29:29,948
SISKO:
I guess they'll just have
to transport aboard...
