1
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:24,107
FEMALE: ( over PA ) <i>All offenders, prepare</i>
<i>for decontamination.</i>

2
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,068
<i>Decontamination will proceed immediately.</i>

3
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:35,243
( groaning )

4
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,522
Miles Edward O'Brien.

5
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,944
The Argrathi Authority
has been conducting a review of your case.

6
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,697
AGRATHI: Do you wish to add anything
to the official record?

7
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,284
No matter.

8
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,079
-Your correction is completed.
-You are free.

9
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:21,539
Free?

10
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:26,628
The crime of espionage requires a minimum
of 15 cycles of correction.

11
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,129
You've been here for 20.

12
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,756
It's time for you to go.

13
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,508
Go?

14
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,721
I can't leave.

15
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,600
Where would I go to?

16
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:44,521
That's not my concern.
Remove him.

17
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,439
( groaning )

18
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,277
( screaming )

19
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,619
There. It's done.

20
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:12,674
Major.

21
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:13,842
It's me, Chief.

22
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,386
It can't be.

23
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,763
It's been 20 years.

24
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,015
You... you haven't changed at all.

25
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,102
Only a few hours have passed
during your correction.

26
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,272
I don't understand.

27
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:37,699
Chief, I know this is going to be hard
for you to accept

28
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:39,868
but you haven't been in prison.

29
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,538
What you experienced
was an artificial reality

30
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,498
an interactive program

31
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,959
that created memories of things
that never actually happened.

32
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,295
What?

33
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,507
ARGRATHI: The Major is correct. We punish
our offenders by giving them memories

34
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,009
of incarceration

35
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,636
modeled to fit each
offender's personality.

36
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,556
It's more efficient
and much more effective

37
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,850
than maintaining
an extensive prison system.

38
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,895
Which means that what you think
you experienced

39
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:11,274
in prison, the things you remember,
didn't happen.

40
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,817
It wasn't real.

41
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,404
It's real to me, Major.

42
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,575
It's real to me.

43
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:27,452
{\an8}He apparently got curious
about some Argrathi technology

44
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:31,080
{\an8}and asked a few too many questions.
The Argrathi Security arrested him

45
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,290
{\an8}and charged him with espionage.

46
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,084
{\an8}But Miles would never break
the law intentionally.

47
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,252
{\an8}I know that,

48
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:39,130
{\an8}but by the time the Argrathi
told us what had happened

49
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,050
{\an8}they had already carried
out his "correction."

50
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,471
{\an8}Can the memories
that they implanted be removed?

51
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:50,558
{\an8}The Argrathi claim it's impossible
but Dr. Bashir will do his best.

52
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,143
{\an8}When can I see him?

53
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,520
{\an8}As soon as Dr. Bashir gives the okay.

54
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,413
{\an8}I used to dream about this,

55
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,333
{\an8}being in a runabout,
coming through the wormhole

56
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,793
{\an8}seeing the station again.

57
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,463
{\an8}Now I keep expecting to wake up
and find myself back in the cell.

58
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:24,717
{\an8}Being in your cell was the dream.
This is the reality.

59
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,101
{\an8}I'd forgotten how beautiful it was.

60
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,856
{\an8}Come on. Let's get you home.

61
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,292
{\an8}Chief.

62
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,128
{\an8}Julian,

63
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:01,712
{\an8}is it really you?

64
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:02,880
{\an8}It's me.

65
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,425
{\an8}He's all yours.

66
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,181
{\an8}I never thought I'd see you again.

67
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,100
{\an8}I was pretty worried about you, too.

68
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,311
{\an8}Keiko?

69
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,565
{\an8}She'll, um, see you in a little while.

70
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,151
{\an8}I want to run some tests first
see what we're up against.

71
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,780
{\an8}And, as for everyone else,
they send their best.

72
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,867
{\an8}They would have been here
but I didn't want you to get overwhelmed.

73
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,119
{\an8}You should take things easy for a while.

74
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,581
Get used to this place again, all right?

75
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:38,666
Doctor's orders?

76
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,084
Oh, absolutely.

77
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,630
I can't imagine what it
would have been like,

78
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,382
Twenty years in that cell.

79
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,509
It was bad.

80
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:50,720
In all that time

81
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,764
were you able to talk
to anyone, see anyone?

82
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,434
I was alone.

83
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,811
( groaning )

84
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,714
Here.

85
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,926
ARGRATHI: ( <i>over PA </i>) <i>All offenders </i>
<i>refusing to comply with dormancy period</i>

86
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,094
<i>will be subject to habitat reprogramming.</i>

87
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:35,181
Eat this.
It'll help you feel better.

88
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,849
It's <i>chee'lash </i>fruit.

89
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,686
Thanks.

90
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,689
I'm the one who should be thanking you.

91
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,983
I've been alone in here for six cycles.

92
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:47,777
Six years?

93
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,112
I know. It's a wonder I'm not insane...

94
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,199
But you find ways to survive.

95
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,868
Let me guess,

96
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:58,663
sedition?

97
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,873
-( <i>chuckling </i>)
-Espionage.

98
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:05,545
Oh... it looks like we're going
to be in here together for a long time.

99
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,673
My name is Ee'Char.

100
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,301
Miles, Miles O'Brien.

101
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,595
Hello, Miles.

102
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,390
Welcome to hell.

103
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,309
Completely alone.

104
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,031
The bottom line is there isn't much
I can do.

105
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,118
The Argrathi didn't just install
memory implants.

106
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,538
They ran Miles through a highly realistic

107
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,583
time-compressed simulation
of the prison experience.

108
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:49,338
In his mind, he lived those 20 years.
He reacted to everything that happened.

109
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,341
He felt pain, fear, hatred.

110
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,094
He made choices and decisions
that affected the outcome.

111
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,306
As a result, those memories are real.

112
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,726
The only way I could rid
him of the memories

113
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,978
would be to wipe his entire memory clean

114
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,980
and, clearly, that isn't an option.

115
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,690
I understand.

116
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,234
Listen, Keiko...

117
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,695
Miles has been through
some terrible things

118
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,655
in his life, as you know,

119
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,533
during the war on Setlik III...

120
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:22,079
that time he was taken prisoner
by the Paradans...

121
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:27,209
during his trial on Cardassia Prime,
and he's always survived.

122
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,339
In the long run, he's going to be okay.

123
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,633
It's just going to take some time.

124
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:02,536
Computer, a piece
of <i>chee'lash </i>fruit, please.

125
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,499
<i>Replicator pattern</i>
<i>for requested fruit is not available.</i>

126
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,668
<i>Please provide specifications.</i>

127
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,423
Well, it... it's sort of, uh...

128
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,302
I don't know the specifications.

129
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,639
Cancel the request.

130
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:22,807
BASHIR: Chief?

131
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,105
Miles?

132
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,274
Oh, Miles.

133
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,776
( sighs )

134
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,029
( sighs )

135
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,784
Miles, what's wrong?

136
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:43,619
You're pregnant?

137
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,788
That's right.

138
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,335
It's been so long, I'd... I'd forgotten.

139
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,379
Oh, Miles...

140
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,632
it's all right.

141
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,885
Everything's going to be all right.

142
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,321
I'm done. Can I go color?

143
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,199
Sure. Make sure to put your plate
in the replicator, sweetie.

144
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,242
Okay.

145
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,547
Do you want to come color with me?

146
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,258
Maybe in a little while.

147
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:50,269
Must be strange
to suddenly have a family again.

148
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,023
It's just...

149
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,234
I've been alone for so long.

150
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,199
Talking about it with Counselor Telnorri
should help.

151
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:06,035
Julian says you'll be seeing him
for a while.

152
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,162
Three counseling sessions a week.

153
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,206
I can hardly wait.

154
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:16,962
Miles?

155
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,172
Mm-hmm.

156
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,341
What are you doing?

157
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,228
It's just a habit I picked up in prison.

158
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,191
The guards didn't care much
whether I lived or died.

159
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,027
Sometimes they wouldn't deliver
food for days

160
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:40,945
weeks even.

161
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,782
When they did feed me

162
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,451
I ate as little as possible
and saved the rest.

163
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:51,705
That's horrible.

164
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,916
You get used to it.

165
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:05,052
ARGRATHI: ( <i>over PA </i>)<i> All food rations</i>
<i>will be suspended until further notice.</i>

166
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,180
<i>Any offenders caught with rations </i>
<i>will be disciplined.</i>

167
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,517
For later.

168
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,311
( chuckles )

169
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,357
( sighs )

170
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,110
( distant yelling )

171
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,320
( sighs )

172
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:24,780
How did you manage?

173
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,532
Hmm?

174
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,119
Six years in here all by yourself.

175
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,663
Oh, you find ways.

176
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:36,125
I'd... exercise
Tell myself stories...

177
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,961
Draw <i>eseekas</i> on the ground.

178
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,422
<i>Eseekas?</i>

179
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,090
Geometric patterns.

180
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:48,137
Drawing them is a way to relax your body
and... occupy the mind.

181
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,347
That helps?

182
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:51,932
Helps me.

183
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,644
( distant screaming )

184
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:56,979
Show me.

185
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,815
It's not easy.

186
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,860
I have plenty of time to learn.

187
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,820
( both chuckle )

188
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:11,619
Here.

189
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,662
This is a good spot.

190
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,298
Start... by drawing a circle.

191
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,013
( groaning )

192
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:41,065
Now... gaze into the circle.

193
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,737
-You want to learn or not?
-I'm gazing.

194
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:48,989
Relax your mind.

195
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:53,661
Imagine that the circle
encompasses your whole existence.

196
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,955
Let it become a part of you.

197
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,625
Now, without thinking

198
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,670
allow your hand to make a mark
inside the circle.

199
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:05,965
( sighs )

200
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,718
Now expand on the mark.

201
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,765
Let it grow organically
until it becomes... a pattern.

202
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:21,939
( laughing )

203
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,942
What are you laughing at?

204
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,820
You look like a <i>reeta-hawk</i>
picking at a corpse.

205
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,280
( squawking )

206
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:36,870
How do you do that?

207
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,956
What? ( squawking )

208
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,917
No! Laugh...
after six years in here.

209
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,212
Well, after six years in a place like this

210
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,505
you either learn to laugh...

211
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:48,799
or you go insane.

212
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,468
I prefer to laugh.

213
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:55,305
ARGRATHI: ( <i>over PA </i>)<i> All offenders </i>
<i>prepare for dormancy period.</i>

214
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:56,849
<i>Any offenders still active</i>

215
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,476
<i>during the dormancy period</i>
<i>will be disciplined.</i>

216
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,397
<i>Illumination will be suspended</i>
<i>in 20 seconds.</i>

217
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,989
Sleep well, Miles.

218
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,659
And if you feel like laughing
in the middle of the night, go ahead.

219
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,244
I'm a heavy sleeper.

220
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,331
ARGRATHI:<i> Dormancy period initiated.</i>

221
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,424
( sighs )

222
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:36,847
Miles?

223
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,646
( snoring softly )

224
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,218
Your throw.

225
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,139
Do I need one 17 or two?

226
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,601
I am not sure.

227
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:23,936
Yeah, neither am I.

228
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,938
We could start again.

229
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,439
No, that's all right.

230
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,192
I know darts isn't really your game.

231
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,569
To be honest, I don't feel
much like playing myself.

232
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,030
We could go kayaking in the holosuite.

233
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,156
You're a good friend, but...

234
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,542
Hold on a second.

235
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,597
Is everything all right?

236
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,349
It's fine.

237
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,019
I just thought I saw someone
I used to know.

238
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,865
Interphasic coil spanner.

239
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,747
ODN recoupler.

240
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,291
You got it.

241
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,507
-It's a...
-No, no, don't tell me. I'll get it.

242
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,468
Um...

243
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,555
a quantum flux regulator.

244
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:42,764
Mark Three.

245
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,391
Perfect.

246
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,476
Let's go through it again.

247
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,354
Chief, you know this stuff.

248
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,355
You don't have to worry about it.

249
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,274
I don't want to be embarrassed

250
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,609
in front of the repair crews.

251
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,777
Even if you get one wrong

252
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,029
no one will think anything of it.

253
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:01,116
You may be a little rusty,
but you're still the Chief.

254
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:05,287
Well, if I'm still the Chief,
I say we go through it again.

255
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,597
All done here.

256
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,017
That was quick.

257
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:31,897
I reconfigured the magnetic wave guides.
Saved us replacing the whole unit.

258
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,357
Good as new.

259
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,235
We're about done here.
If it's all right with you

260
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,111
I was going to dismiss
the crew for lunch.

261
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,071
You go ahead.

262
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,114
There's a couple of things
I want to look at down here.

263
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,282
Brush up a little more.

264
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,784
Keep up the good work, crewman.

265
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,911
Another week or two,
you'll be running the place.

266
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,454
Don't you forget it.

267
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,004
Ah...

268
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,756
There you are, Chief.

269
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,633
Hello, Julian.

270
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,803
-Come to check up on me?
-To be honest, yes.

271
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,306
Counselor Telnorri says that you
haven't been to see him in ten days.

272
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:07,766
So?

273
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,978
So you're supposed to see
him three times a week.

274
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,437
What for?

275
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,149
All Telnorri ever wants to do
is sit and listen to me tell stories

276
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,318
of what it was like
to be in an Argrathi prison.

277
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,362
How often did they beat me?

278
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:23,282
Was I distressed by the lack
of toilet facilities?

279
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,409
If you ask me, he's the one
with the problem.

280
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:29,246
You can talk to a different counselor,
someone you might like better.

281
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,790
Julian, I don't want to talk
to a counselor.

282
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,459
I just want to forget about
what happened on Argratha

283
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,502
and get on with my life.

284
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,422
-Just like that?
-Yes, just like that.

285
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:43,468
I don't need counseling
or relaxation, or time to adjust.

286
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,929
I just want to be left alone.

287
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,349
I'd have thought after being
alone for 20 years

288
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,934
you'd want someone to talk to.

289
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,646
If there's one thing I haven't missed
in the last 20 years

290
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,232
it's your smug, superior attitude.

291
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,568
Now, I have told you
I want to be left alone

292
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,652
and I meant it.

293
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,905
So, if you know what's good for you
you'll stay the hell away from me!

294
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,166
Promenade.

295
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:28,388
Tell me about Keiko again,
about how much... you like her eyes.

296
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,560
I've told you about her a hundred times.

297
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,022
What more is there to say?

298
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,274
Well, I like hearing about her.

299
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,279
If I had a beautiful wife
I'd, I'd talk about her, believe me.

300
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:49,201
Besides, uh, talking about her
always relaxes you

301
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:52,496
and your pacing
is getting a little distracting.

302
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:55,040
Oh, yeah?

303
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:56,750
Yeah.

304
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,377
Well, your drawing is bothering me.

305
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,630
-Since when?
-Since now.

306
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:08,053
-You didn't need to do that.
-Don't tell me what I need.

307
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,680
-Miles...
-Don't "Miles" me!

308
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,932
I'm sick of it!

309
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,768
I'm sick of this place,
I'm sick of your drawing

310
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,687
-and most of all, I am sick of you!
-Try to be calm.

311
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,856
I don't want to be calm!

312
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,609
I've had it with this place.

313
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,111
( distant yelling )

314
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,487
I don't belong here!

315
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,738
( yelling continues )

316
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:30,784
Do you hear me?
I don't belong here.

317
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,161
I didn't do anything wrong.
I know you're listening!

318
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,747
-Miles...
-I don't belong here!

319
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,833
Let me out of here!

320
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:41,169
I didn't do anything wrong,
and you know it!

321
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,130
AGRATHI: ( over PA ) <i>All offenders</i>

Miles!

326

( yelling )

327
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,933
Be quiet!

328

QUARK: That's one Black Hole
straight up, right?

329
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,484
Synthale, please.

330
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,653
Be right with you, Chief.

331
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,583
Quark, what about that synthale?

332
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,750
Just another minute.

333
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:26,590
Quark?

334
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,968
Look, Chief, I'm a little busy
right now.

335
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,264
I'm in no mood for games, Quark.

336
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,308
So why don't you give me my drink

337
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:39,686
or I break every bone
in your worthless little body.

338
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,272
Chief, just because your life's
in shambles right now--

339
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,149
( groaning )

340
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,611
One synthale coming right up.

341
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,112
( gasping )

342
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:17,766
Miles?

343
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:20,477
Ee'Char.

344
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:25,732
-What are you doing here?
-I've never really been gone, have I?

345
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,526
You're not real.

346
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,695
You're just in my head.

347
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,530
That's all I ever was.

348
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,660
But I'm real to you
and that's all that matters.

349
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,787
Go away.

350
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:43,500
I can't.
I'm your friend. You need me.

351
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,002
You are the last thing I need.

352
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,089
You're wrong, Miles.
You need me, now more than ever.

353
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:19,536
What are you doing?

354
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:21,746
I'm going to work.

355
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:28,169
Miles, as your friend
I have to tell you I'm worried about you.

356
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,176
Don't be. I'm home.

357
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:36,678
I'm working

358
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,306
and for the first time in as long
as I can remember

359
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:40,807
I feel good.

360
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,310
Then why am I here?

361
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:46,313
<i>Sisko to O'Brien.</i>
<i>Please report to my office.</i>

362
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:47,355
On my way.

363
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,858
Look, I don't know why you're here

364
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,027
and I don't care.

365
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,417
Have a seat.

366
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:19,054
I understand you had a confrontation
with Dr. Bashir yesterday.

367
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,473
Oh, that's a...
That was nothing.

368
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,516
Not according to Dr. Bashir.

369
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:27,312
We had a little argument.
Julian and I are always arguing.

370
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,982
According to Constable Odo
you also had an incident with Quark.

371
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,233
Did that little?

372
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:38,073
Look, sir, I may have let things get
a little out of hand, but...

373
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:39,908
It won't happen again.

374
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:40,992
Hmm...

375
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,996
Dr. Bashir also tells me
that you've stopped seeing your counselor.

376
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,082
Sir, I've been very busy lately--

377
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:49,626
The agreement was that you
were going to see a counselor

378
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:50,543
on a regular basis.

379
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,129
You're right.

380
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,590
I'll make an appointment
to go see him tomorrow.

381
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,092
You'll see him today.

382
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,427
Immediately.

383
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,263
I have a lot of work to do today, sir.

384
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,556
The work can wait.

385
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,727
As of now, you're relieved of duty.

386
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,397
I want you to report to Counselor Telnorri

387
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,982
and begin attending
daily counseling sessions

388
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,151
for as long as he thinks it's advisable.

389
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,696
Sir, you're blowing this all
out of proportion.

390
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,198
You know that's not true.

391
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,367
What happened to you on Argratha

392
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,953
affected you a lot more
than you're willing to admit

393
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:27,080
and it's not going to get better overnight

394
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,915
no matter how much you want it to.

395
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:30,834
You need help.

396
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,169
Please, Captain.

397
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:39,050
I'm asking you as a personal favor to me.
Give me one more chance.

398
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,471
I wish I could.

399
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:46,933
But right now

400
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,103
in the judgment
of this station's Chief Medical Officer

401
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,524
you're unfit for duty
which means you're on medical leave

402
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,608
effective immediately

403
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:58,570
and if you don't begin attending
counseling sessions

404
00:28:58,653 --> 00:28:59,487
on a regular basis

405
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,657
and cooperating in every
other way with your physician

406
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,200
I will have no choice

407
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,244
but to have you confined
to the Infirmary.

408
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:07,579
Is that clear?

409
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,248
Yes, sir.

410
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:14,461
Dismissed.

411
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:27,682
Chief, I was just about to head down
to the Replimat...

412
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,100
Not now, Commander.

413
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,396
Promenade.

414
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,198
What the hell did you say to him?

415
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,408
I take it you talked to Captain Sisko.

416
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,409
I talked to him, all right.

417
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,788
-He relieved me of duty.
-It's for the best, Miles.

418
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,790
How do you know what's best for me?

419
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,167
You have no idea what I've been
going through!

420
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:57,504
You're right. You were alone in that cell.
I wasn't there with you.

421
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:00,173
I didn't see what they did to you,
but I do know you suffered

422
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:02,926
and that you're still suffering now,
and I'm trying to help.

423
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,719
I never asked for your help.

424
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:08,515
You didn't need to ask.
I'm your doctor and your friend.

425
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,558
EE'CHAR: You should listen to him, Miles.

426
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,019
He cares about you
just like I did.

427
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,855
Don't make the same mistake with him
you did with me.

428
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,067
Don't you get it?

429
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,862
You're not my friend! Not anymore!

430
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,032
The O'Brien that was your friend
died in that cell!

431
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,492
He's not dead.

432
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,995
He just needs a little help
that's all.

433
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,664
Stay away from me.

434
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,626
I don't want your help,
I don't want your friendship

435
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,211
I just want to be left alone!

436
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,342
-Where are you going?
-I told you to go away!

437
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:47,804
Miles, please, don't do this.
Go back there and talk to him.

438
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:48,888
He wants to help you.

439
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,890
-Like you did?
-That's right.

440
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:54,143
-We're both your friends.
-Yeah, and look what happened to you.

441
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:55,979
Habitat Ring.

442
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:06,573
You know, sooner or later
you'll have to tell someone about me.

443
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:07,532
Like hell I will.

444
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,452
You can't run from me forever.

445
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:13,955
You're dead

446
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,249
so why don't you go away
and leave me alone?

447
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,877
You want me to leave?
I'll leave!

448
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,336
Send me away!

449
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,880
Don't you see?

450
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:25,091
If I keep coming back
it's because some part of you

451
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:26,467
keeps bringing me here!

452
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,944
Miles, Julian's been trying
to contact you for an hour.

453
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,780
-Where have you been?
-Walking. Thinking.

454
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,783
I know. I heard. I'm sorry.

455
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:54,787
-I know how much your work means to you.
-Try telling that to Julian.

456
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,624
Daddy, come see what I drew.

457
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:01,461
-Not now, honey, okay?
-I'm sure it's only temporary.

458
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,254
You'll be back at work
before you know it.

459
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,797
Daddy, you have to come see.

460
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,674
Look, can we talk about this later?

461
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,885
-Daddy, come on!
-Not now.

462
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:11,804
-Please, Daddy, please!
-I said not now, right?

463
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,890
-I said not!
-Miles! What are you doing?

464
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,936
Oh, shh, shh.

465
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:21,898
I didn't mean to...

466
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,316
Shh.

467
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,319
I'm sorry.

468
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,196
Chief?

469
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,118
Get out of here, Julian.

470
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,039
You don't want to do this, Chief.

471
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,666
The hell I don't.

472
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,005
Look, I don't claim to know
what you're going through

473
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:11,591
but whatever it is,
it's not worth dying for.

474
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,054
You don't understand at all.

475
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:19,807
I'm not doing this for me.

476
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:26,022
I'm doing it to protect Keiko and Molly
and everyone else in this station.

477
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,858
-Protect us from what?
-From me.

478
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,072
I'm not the man I used to be.

479
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,075
I'm dangerous.

480
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,955
I nearly hit Molly today.

481
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,958
All she wanted was a little attention

482
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,795
and I nearly hit her.

483
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,630
But you didn't.

484
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,384
You're a good man, Miles Edward O'Brien

485
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,846
and whatever it is you think
you've done wrong

486
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,348
you don't deserve to die.

487
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,058
You sound like Ee'Char.

488
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,143
Who's Ee'Char?

489
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:10,024
He's... not real.

490
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,655
He's just a memory, that's all.

491
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,324
A memory from Argratha?

492
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:22,453
Who was he?
Another prisoner? A guard?

493
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,289
He was my cell mate.

494
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,417
You told me you were alone
in that cell.

495
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,711
Twenty years with no one to talk to.

496
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:44,183
I was at the end, a week... two maybe.

497
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,437
But the rest of the time...

498
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,566
There was Ee'Char.

499
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,111
What happened to him?

500
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,701
( distant yelling )

501
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:02,618
Ah...

502
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,537
Why'd you do that?

503
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:11,919
It wasn't helping.

504
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,339
You need to concentrate more.

505
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:19,427
It doesn't matter how much I concentrate.
I'm still starving.

506
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,430
( sighs )

507
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,307
So am I.

508
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,393
You sure there's nothing left?

509
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,605
Not unless you have a hiding
place I don't know about.

510
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:33,482
We ate the last of the food
I put away a week ago.

511
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,362
We should have stockpiled more.

512
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,282
We should have prepared for this.

513
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,160
They've never let us go this long
without food before.

514
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:50,666
Maybe they've forgotten about us
or just decided to finally let us die.

515
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,213
Then we die.

516
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,925
ARGRATHI: ( <i>over PA </i>) <i>All offenders </i>
<i>prepare for dormancy period.</i>

517
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,802
<i>Any offender still active</i>
<i>during the dormancy period</i>

518
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:02,803
<i>will be disciplined.</i>

519
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:06,057
<i>Illumination will be suspended</i>
<i>in 20 seconds.</i>

520
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,559
What are you doing?

521
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,603
I'm going to sleep.

522
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:15,566
-How can you sleep at a time like this?
-Maybe I'll dream about food.

523
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,694
You're crazy.

524
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:19,904
No...

525
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,406
Just hungry.

526
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,326
ARGRATHI: ( <i>over PA </i>)<i> </i>
<i>Dormancy period initiated.</i>

527
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:19,588
( yelling )

528
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,886
You pretended to be my friend

529
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,389
and all the time you were holding
out on me.

530
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,266
Now who's acting crazy?

531
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:40,276
After everything I've done for you
you ungrateful...

532
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,335
( bones crunching )

533
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,640
( chuckling )

534
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,184
You...

535
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,229
You were saving it for both of us.

536
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:25,821
Ee'Char.

537
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,659
Ee'Char, wake up.

538
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,215
Ee'Char... Ee'Char...

539
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,427
You killed him?

540
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,392
The worst part of it was...

541
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:59,605
The next day, the guards
began feeding me again.

542
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,109
I killed him for nothing,

543
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,946
for a scrap of bread
he was going to share with me.

544
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,740
But it was a mistake. You didn't mean it.

545
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:13,702
I meant it.

546
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,831
I wanted him to die.

547
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,960
I keep telling myself...

548
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,504
It doesn't matter.

549
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,256
It wasn't real.

550
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,966
But that's a lie.

551
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,885
If it had been real, if it had been you

552
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,095
instead of him

553
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,389
it wouldn't have made any difference.

554
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:38,394
He was my best friend and I murdered him.

555
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,899
When we were growing up,
they used to tell us...

556
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,444
Humanity had evolved

557
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:52,241
that mankind had outgrown hate and rage.

558
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,246
But when it came down to it

559
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:03,043
when I had the chance to show
that no matter what anyone did to me

560
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,713
I was still an evolved human being...

561
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,008
I failed.

562
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,473
I repaid kindness with blood.

563
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,520
I was no better than an animal.

564
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,314
No. No, no, no.

565
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,149
An animal would've killed Ee'Char

566
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:28,068
and never had a second thought,
never shed a tear

567
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,362
but not you. You hate yourself.

568
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,283
You hate yourself so much you think
you deserve to die.

569
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:38,746
The Argrathi did everything they could
to strip you of your humanity

570
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,917
and in the end, for one brief moment
they succeeded.

571
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,879
But you can't let that brief moment
define your entire life.

572
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:52,134
If you do, if you pull that trigger
then the Argrathi will have won.

573
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:59,433
They will have destroyed a good man.
You cannot let that happen, my friend.

574
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,115
Miles.

575
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:18,953
Be well, Miles.

576
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:47,022
Thirty milligrams twice a day.
Take it religiously for a month.

577
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,149
And if all goes well
we'll experiment with a lower dosage.

578
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,192
You sure this'll work?

579
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:53,529
It's a treatment, not a cure.
It'll prevent hallucinations

580
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,656
take the edge off the depression
but that's all it'll do.

581
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,783
It won't take away the memories
or the feelings.

582
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,243
You mean the guilt.

583
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,161
Well, that'll take time.

584
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,832
Now's the part where you tell me

585
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,875
I have to start seeing
Counselor Telnorri again.

586
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,253
Unless you want to talk to me.

587
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:11,839
Telnorri'll be fine.

588
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,847
Thanks, Julian... For everything.

589
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,974
What are friends for?

590
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,194
Daddy's home! Daddy's home!

591
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:44,121
That's right. Daddy's home.
