1
00:00:20,408 --> 00:00:24,076
All offenders, prepare
for decontamination.

2
00:00:24,116 --> 00:00:27,352
Decontamination will proceed
immediately.

3
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:04,603
Miles Edward O'Brien.

4
00:01:06,785 --> 00:01:08,254
The Argrathi Authority

5
00:01:08,288 --> 00:01:10,657
has been conducting
a review of your case.

6
00:01:10,694 --> 00:01:13,292
Do you wish to add anything
to the official record?

7
00:01:15,338 --> 00:01:16,773
No matter.

8
00:01:16,809 --> 00:01:19,373
Your correction is completed.
You are free.

9
00:01:19,415 --> 00:01:21,078
Free?

10
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,418
The crime

11
00:01:22,456 --> 00:01:24,016
of espionage requires

12
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,828
a minimum of 15 cycles
of correction.

13
00:01:26,866 --> 00:01:28,563
You've been here for 20.

14
00:01:28,604 --> 00:01:30,130
It's time for you to go.

15
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:31,974
Go?

16
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,316
I can't leave.

17
00:01:39,163 --> 00:01:41,327
Where would I go to?

18
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,201
That's not my concern.

19
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:45,233
Remove him.

20
00:01:57,674 --> 00:01:58,802
There.

21
00:01:58,843 --> 00:02:00,506
It's done.

22
00:02:12,108 --> 00:02:13,076
Major.

23
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,138
It's me, Chief.

24
00:02:15,182 --> 00:02:17,517
It can't be.

25
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,955
It's been 20 years.

26
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:21,360
You... you
haven't changed at all.

27
00:02:21,397 --> 00:02:24,667
Only a few hours have passed
during your correction.

28
00:02:24,705 --> 00:02:27,803
I don't understand.

29
00:02:32,725 --> 00:02:38,228
Chief, I know this is going
to be hard for you to accept

30
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,707
but you haven't been in prison.

31
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:44,014
What you experienced
was an artificial reality

32
00:02:44,051 --> 00:02:45,577
an interactive program

33
00:02:45,622 --> 00:02:49,222
that created memories of things
that never actually happened.

34
00:02:49,264 --> 00:02:50,232
What?

35
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:51,565
The Major is correct.

36
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:54,371
We punish our offenders
by giving them memories

37
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,210
of incarceration

38
00:02:56,247 --> 00:02:58,913
modeled to fit each
offender's personality.

39
00:02:58,953 --> 00:03:01,858
It's more efficient
and much more effective

40
00:03:01,894 --> 00:03:04,492
than maintaining
an extensive prison system.

41
00:03:04,534 --> 00:03:07,530
Which means that what
you think you experienced

42
00:03:07,574 --> 00:03:10,103
in prison...
the things you remember...

43
00:03:10,147 --> 00:03:11,741
didn't happen.

44
00:03:11,784 --> 00:03:14,313
It wasn't real.

45
00:03:14,357 --> 00:03:17,330
It's real to me, Major.

46
00:03:19,636 --> 00:03:21,539
It's real to me.

47
00:05:24,297 --> 00:05:27,395
He apparently got curious
about some Argrathi technology

48
00:05:27,438 --> 00:05:29,375
and asked
a few too many questions.

49
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,244
The Argrathi Security
arrested him

50
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,977
and charged him with espionage.

51
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:35,388
But Miles would never
break the law intentionally.

52
00:05:35,424 --> 00:05:36,825
I know that

53
00:05:36,861 --> 00:05:39,834
but by the time the Argrathi
told us what had happened

54
00:05:39,868 --> 00:05:42,466
they had already
carried out his "correction."

55
00:05:42,574 --> 00:05:46,949
Can the memories
that they implanted be removed?

56
00:05:46,985 --> 00:05:48,682
The Argrathi claim
it's impossible

57
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,194
but Dr. Bashir will do his best.

58
00:05:51,228 --> 00:05:52,458
When can I see him?

59
00:05:52,498 --> 00:05:55,266
As soon as Dr. Bashir
gives the okay.

60
00:06:09,806 --> 00:06:12,870
I used to dream about this...

61
00:06:12,913 --> 00:06:15,407
being in a runabout,
coming through the wormhole

62
00:06:15,453 --> 00:06:17,390
seeing the station again.

63
00:06:17,425 --> 00:06:18,985
Now I keep expecting to wake up

64
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:20,793
and find myself
back in the cell.

65
00:06:20,832 --> 00:06:22,826
Being in your cell
was the dream.

66
00:06:22,871 --> 00:06:25,435
This is the reality.

67
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:33,794
I'd forgotten
how beautiful it was.

68
00:06:35,668 --> 00:06:39,541
Come on.
Let's get you home.

69
00:06:57,521 --> 00:06:58,580
Chief.

70
00:06:58,623 --> 00:07:00,924
Julian...

71
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:02,193
is it really you?

72
00:07:02,232 --> 00:07:04,362
It's me.

73
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,237
He's all yours.

74
00:07:09,883 --> 00:07:12,549
I never thought
I'd see you again.

75
00:07:12,624 --> 00:07:14,891
I was pretty worried
about you, too.

76
00:07:16,366 --> 00:07:17,835
Keiko?

77
00:07:17,869 --> 00:07:21,275
She'll, um, see you
in a little while.

78
00:07:21,311 --> 00:07:22,473
I want to run some tests first

79
00:07:22,514 --> 00:07:24,177
see what we're up against.

80
00:07:24,218 --> 00:07:28,320
And, as for everyone else,
they send their best.

81
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:29,351
They would have been here

82
00:07:29,397 --> 00:07:31,527
but I didn't want you
to get overwhelmed.

83
00:07:31,568 --> 00:07:33,732
You should take things
easy for a while.

84
00:07:33,774 --> 00:07:37,180
Get used to this place
again, all right?

85
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,209
Doctor's orders?

86
00:07:39,254 --> 00:07:40,985
Oh, absolutely.

87
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,990
I can't imagine what it
would have been like...

88
00:07:45,034 --> 00:07:47,267
20 years in that cell.

89
00:07:47,306 --> 00:07:49,777
It was bad.

90
00:07:49,813 --> 00:07:51,077
In all that time

91
00:07:51,116 --> 00:07:55,149
were you able to talk
to anyone, see anyone?

92
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:57,095
I was alone.

93
00:08:25,264 --> 00:08:26,995
Here.

94
00:08:27,035 --> 00:08:30,236
All offenders refusing to comply
with dormancy period

95
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,679
will be subject
to habitat reprogramming.

96
00:08:32,749 --> 00:08:33,682
Eat this.

97
00:08:33,784 --> 00:08:35,652
It'll help you feel better.

98
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:37,626
It's <i>chee'lash</i> fruit.

99
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:41,560
Thanks.

100
00:08:41,603 --> 00:08:44,337
I'm the one
who should be thanking you.

101
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:47,042
I've been alone in here
for six cycles.

102
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,712
Six years?

103
00:08:48,753 --> 00:08:50,951
I know. It's a wonder
I'm not insane...

104
00:08:50,992 --> 00:08:55,162
but you find ways to survive.

105
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,673
Let me guess...

106
00:08:57,709 --> 00:08:59,076
sedition?

107
00:08:59,112 --> 00:09:01,242
Espionage.

108
00:09:01,284 --> 00:09:04,451
Oh... it looks like
we're going to be

109
00:09:04,491 --> 00:09:07,692
in here together
for a long time.

110
00:09:07,766 --> 00:09:09,794
My name is Ee'Char.

111
00:09:09,838 --> 00:09:13,301
Miles, Miles O'Brien.

112
00:09:13,346 --> 00:09:16,444
Hello, Miles.

113
00:09:16,487 --> 00:09:18,856
Welcome to hell.

114
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,988
Completely alone.

115
00:09:32,926 --> 00:09:35,899
The bottom line is
there isn't much I can do.

116
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:39,100
The Argrathi didn't just
install memory implants.

117
00:09:39,141 --> 00:09:41,909
They ran Miles through
a highly realistic

118
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:45,787
time-compressed simulation
of the prison experience.

119
00:09:45,824 --> 00:09:48,763
In his mind,
he lived those 20 years.

120
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,291
He reacted to everything
that happened.

121
00:09:51,337 --> 00:09:53,638
He felt pain, fear, hatred.

122
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:57,310
He made choices and decisions
that affected the outcome.

123
00:09:57,351 --> 00:09:59,983
As a result,
those memories are real.

124
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:03,089
The only way I could rid him
of the memories

125
00:10:03,132 --> 00:10:05,696
would be to wipe
his entire memory clean

126
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:08,039
and, clearly,
that isn't an option.

127
00:10:08,077 --> 00:10:10,048
I understand.

128
00:10:10,082 --> 00:10:11,813
Listen, Keiko...

129
00:10:11,852 --> 00:10:14,289
Miles has been through
some terrible things

130
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:16,056
in his life, as you know...

131
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:20,061
during the war
on Setlik III...

132
00:10:20,106 --> 00:10:23,877
that time he was taken
prisoner by the Paradans...

133
00:10:23,948 --> 00:10:26,750
during his trial
on Cardassia Prime...

134
00:10:26,788 --> 00:10:29,225
and he's always survived.

135
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:32,895
In the long run,
he's going to be okay.

136
00:10:32,937 --> 00:10:35,431
It's just going
to take some time.

137
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:04,377
Computer... a piece
of <i>chee'lash</i> fruit, please.

138
00:11:04,412 --> 00:11:06,212
Replicator pattern

139
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,743
for requested fruit
is not available.

140
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:10,623
Please provide specifications.

141
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:17,267
Well, it... it's sort of, uh...

142
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,773
I don't know the specifications.

143
00:11:20,818 --> 00:11:23,085
Cancel the request.

144
00:11:23,123 --> 00:11:25,117
Chief?

145
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,003
Miles?

146
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:34,039
Oh, Miles.

147
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:44,174
Miles, what's wrong?

148
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,802
You're pregnant?

149
00:11:45,845 --> 00:11:47,576
That's right.

150
00:11:49,587 --> 00:11:53,323
It's been so long,
I'd... I'd forgotten.

151
00:11:53,362 --> 00:11:56,267
Oh, Miles...

152
00:11:56,303 --> 00:11:59,037
it's all right.

153
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:02,433
Everything's going
to be all right.

154
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,941
I'm done.
Can I go color?

155
00:12:19,975 --> 00:12:22,003
Sure. Make sure
to put your plate

156
00:12:22,046 --> 00:12:23,640
in the replicator, sweetie.

157
00:12:23,684 --> 00:12:25,017
Okay.

158
00:12:34,843 --> 00:12:37,645
Do you want to come
color with me?

159
00:12:37,684 --> 00:12:40,555
Maybe in a little while.

160
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,177
Must be strange

161
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:51,546
to suddenly have a family again.

162
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:56,659
It's just...

163
00:12:56,696 --> 00:12:59,328
I've been alone for so long.

164
00:13:01,173 --> 00:13:04,237
Talking about it with
Counselor Telnorri should help.

165
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,082
Julian says you'll be
seeing him for a while.

166
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:09,821
Three counseling
sessions a week.

167
00:13:09,861 --> 00:13:11,889
I can hardly wait.

168
00:13:16,577 --> 00:13:17,876
Miles?

169
00:13:17,914 --> 00:13:19,543
Mm-hmm.

170
00:13:19,584 --> 00:13:21,418
What are you doing?

171
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,392
Nothing.

172
00:13:25,699 --> 00:13:27,829
I mean, with your food.

173
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:39,462
It's just a habit
I picked up in prison.

174
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:44,703
The guards didn't care much
whether I lived or died.

175
00:13:44,745 --> 00:13:47,274
Sometimes they wouldn't
deliver food for days

176
00:13:47,318 --> 00:13:49,448
weeks even.

177
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,893
When they did feed me

178
00:13:51,928 --> 00:13:55,164
I ate as little as possible
and saved the rest.

179
00:13:57,609 --> 00:13:59,203
That's horrible.

180
00:13:59,246 --> 00:14:01,376
You get used to it.

181
00:14:08,601 --> 00:14:10,435
All food rations

182
00:14:10,506 --> 00:14:12,443
will be suspended
until further notice.

183
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:15,383
Any offenders caught with
rations will be disciplined.

184
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:19,560
For later.

185
00:14:30,956 --> 00:14:32,950
How did you manage?

186
00:14:32,993 --> 00:14:34,622
Hmm?

187
00:14:34,664 --> 00:14:37,831
Six years in here
all by yourself.

188
00:14:37,872 --> 00:14:39,809
Oh, you find ways.

189
00:14:39,843 --> 00:14:42,475
I'd... exercise

190
00:14:42,516 --> 00:14:43,951
tell myself stories...

191
00:14:43,987 --> 00:14:46,288
draw <i>eseekas</i> on the ground.

192
00:14:47,729 --> 00:14:49,198
<i>Eseekas?</i>

193
00:14:49,232 --> 00:14:50,667
Geometric patterns.

194
00:14:50,702 --> 00:14:52,866
Drawing them is a way
to relax your body

195
00:14:52,908 --> 00:14:56,474
and... occupy the mind.

196
00:14:56,516 --> 00:14:57,985
That helps?

197
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,048
Helps me.

198
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:04,835
Show me.

199
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,431
It's not easy.

200
00:15:07,476 --> 00:15:10,574
I have plenty of time to learn.

201
00:15:18,068 --> 00:15:20,039
Here.

202
00:15:20,073 --> 00:15:22,067
This is a good spot.

203
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,433
Start... by drawing a circle.

204
00:15:45,099 --> 00:15:48,767
Now... gaze into the circle.

205
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:52,975
You want to learn or not?

206
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:54,989
I'm gazing.

207
00:15:55,023 --> 00:15:56,994
Relax your mind.

208
00:15:57,028 --> 00:15:58,793
Imagine that the circle

209
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,303
encompasses
your whole existence.

210
00:16:01,338 --> 00:16:04,402
Let it become a part of you.

211
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:07,146
Now, without thinking

212
00:16:07,186 --> 00:16:10,592
allow your hand to make a mark
inside the circle.

213
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:17,736
Now expand on the mark.

214
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:23,052
Let it grow organically
until it becomes... a pattern.

215
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,381
What are you laughing at?

216
00:16:33,415 --> 00:16:36,411
You look like a <i>reeta-hawk</i>
picking at a corpse.

217
00:16:42,971 --> 00:16:44,942
How do you do that?

218
00:16:44,976 --> 00:16:45,966
What?

219
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:48,147
No! Laugh...

220
00:16:48,184 --> 00:16:49,813
after six years in here.

221
00:16:49,855 --> 00:16:52,828
Well, after six years
in a place like this

222
00:16:52,862 --> 00:16:55,197
you either learn to laugh...

223
00:16:55,234 --> 00:16:57,467
or you go insane.

224
00:16:57,507 --> 00:16:59,569
I prefer to laugh.

225
00:16:59,611 --> 00:17:02,881
All offenders prepare
for dormancy period.

226
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,787
Any offenders still active

227
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:07,854
during the dormancy period
will be disciplined.

228
00:17:07,898 --> 00:17:10,894
Illumination will be suspended
in 20 seconds.

229
00:17:18,222 --> 00:17:19,623
Sleep well, Miles.

230
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:21,892
And if you feel like laughing

231
00:17:21,932 --> 00:17:24,335
in the middle of the night,
go ahead.

232
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:26,672
I'm a heavy sleeper.

233
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:29,146
Dormancy period initiated.

234
00:17:43,283 --> 00:17:45,277
Miles?

235
00:18:20,873 --> 00:18:21,932
Your throw.

236
00:18:24,949 --> 00:18:27,011
Do I need one 17 or two?

237
00:18:29,226 --> 00:18:30,490
I am not sure.

238
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,124
Yeah, neither am I.

239
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:33,796
We could start again.

240
00:18:33,837 --> 00:18:36,035
No, that's all right.

241
00:18:36,075 --> 00:18:38,171
I know darts
isn't really your game.

242
00:18:38,214 --> 00:18:41,119
To be honest, I don't feel
much like playing myself.

243
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:43,216
We could go kayaking
in the holosuite.

244
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:45,059
You're a good friend, but...

245
00:18:52,783 --> 00:18:54,777
Hold on a second.

246
00:19:07,384 --> 00:19:09,184
Is everything all right?

247
00:19:09,222 --> 00:19:10,816
It's fine.

248
00:19:10,893 --> 00:19:14,231
I just thought I saw
someone I used to know.

249
00:19:24,292 --> 00:19:27,265
Interphasic coil spanner.

250
00:19:31,976 --> 00:19:34,140
ODN recoupler.

251
00:19:34,182 --> 00:19:36,176
You got it.

252
00:19:40,598 --> 00:19:41,411
It's a...

253
00:19:41,544 --> 00:19:43,138
No, no, don't tell me.
I'll get it.

254
00:19:44,818 --> 00:19:46,310
Um...

255
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:48,987
a quantum flux regulator.

256
00:19:49,028 --> 00:19:50,327
Mark Three.

257
00:19:50,365 --> 00:19:52,802
Perfect.

258
00:19:52,838 --> 00:19:54,307
Let's go through it again.

259
00:19:54,342 --> 00:19:56,813
Chief, you know this stuff.

260
00:19:56,847 --> 00:19:58,146
You don't have
to worry about it.

261
00:19:58,184 --> 00:20:00,986
I don't want to be embarrassed
in front of the repair crews.

262
00:20:01,024 --> 00:20:02,995
Even if you get one wrong

263
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:05,330
no one will think
anything of it.

264
00:20:05,368 --> 00:20:09,743
You may be a little rusty,
but you're still the Chief.

265
00:20:09,778 --> 00:20:13,811
Well, if I'm still the Chief,
I say we go through it again.

266
00:20:29,392 --> 00:20:31,590
All done here.

267
00:20:33,435 --> 00:20:34,734
That was quick.

268
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:37,072
I reconfigured the
magnetic wave guides.

269
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:39,777
Saved us replacing
the whole unit.

270
00:20:39,817 --> 00:20:41,480
Good as new.

271
00:20:41,521 --> 00:20:42,546
We're about done here.

272
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,615
If it's all right with you

273
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,323
I was going to dismiss
the crew for lunch.

274
00:20:45,364 --> 00:20:46,765
You go ahead.

275
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,668
There's a couple of things
I want to look at down here.

276
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:49,673
Brush up a little more.

277
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,142
Keep up the good work, crewman.

278
00:20:51,177 --> 00:20:53,546
Another week or two,
you'll be running the place.

279
00:20:53,584 --> 00:20:55,487
Don't you forget it.

280
00:21:01,703 --> 00:21:03,799
Ah...

281
00:21:03,841 --> 00:21:05,744
there you are, Chief.

282
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,477
Hello, Julian.

283
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:09,317
Come to check up on me?

284
00:21:09,355 --> 00:21:10,654
To be honest, yes.

285
00:21:10,758 --> 00:21:11,954
Counselor Telnorri says

286
00:21:11,994 --> 00:21:14,124
that you haven't been
to see him in ten days.

287
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,533
So?

288
00:21:15,569 --> 00:21:18,770
So you're supposed to see
him three times a week.

289
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:20,144
What for?

290
00:21:20,181 --> 00:21:22,152
All Telnorri ever wants to do

291
00:21:22,186 --> 00:21:23,655
is sit and listen
to me tell stories

292
00:21:23,689 --> 00:21:25,683
of what it was like to be
in an Argrathi prison.

293
00:21:25,728 --> 00:21:28,222
How often did they beat me?

294
00:21:28,266 --> 00:21:31,034
Was I distressed by
the lack of toilet facilities?

295
00:21:31,073 --> 00:21:33,476
If you ask me, he's the one
with the problem.

296
00:21:33,512 --> 00:21:35,608
You can talk
to a different counselor...

297
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:37,119
someone you might like better.

298
00:21:37,154 --> 00:21:39,489
Julian, I don't want
to talk to a counselor.

299
00:21:39,527 --> 00:21:42,159
I just want to forget about
what happened on Argratha

300
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,396
and get on with my life.

301
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:44,199
Just like that?

302
00:21:44,238 --> 00:21:46,141
Yes, just like that.

303
00:21:46,176 --> 00:21:48,170
I don't need counseling

304
00:21:48,214 --> 00:21:51,450
or relaxation,
or time to adjust.

305
00:21:51,489 --> 00:21:54,223
I just want to be left alone.

306
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:56,756
I'd have thought after being
alone for 20 years

307
00:21:56,802 --> 00:21:58,773
you'd want someone to talk to.

308
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,141
If there's one thing
I haven't missed

309
00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:02,443
in the last 20 years

310
00:22:02,482 --> 00:22:04,919
it's your smug,
superior attitude.

311
00:22:04,954 --> 00:22:07,187
Now, I have told you
I want to be left alone

312
00:22:07,227 --> 00:22:08,628
and I meant it.

313
00:22:08,664 --> 00:22:10,293
So, if you know
what's good for you

314
00:22:10,334 --> 00:22:12,031
you'll stay the hell
away from me!

315
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:22,552
Promenade.

316
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:33,047
Tell me about Keiko again...

317
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:36,791
about how much...
you like her eyes.

318
00:22:38,601 --> 00:22:42,907
I've told you about her
a hundred times.

319
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:45,577
What more is there to say?

320
00:22:45,618 --> 00:22:47,486
Well, I like hearing about her.

321
00:22:47,523 --> 00:22:49,288
If I had a beautiful wife

322
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:51,628
I'd, I'd talk about her,
believe me.

323
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:57,246
Besides, uh, talking about
her always relaxes you.

324
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,247
And your pacing

325
00:22:58,282 --> 00:23:00,378
is getting a little distracting.

326
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:02,755
Oh, yeah?

327
00:23:02,793 --> 00:23:04,353
Yeah.

328
00:23:04,396 --> 00:23:07,062
Well, your drawing
is bothering me.

329
00:23:07,103 --> 00:23:08,162
Since when?

330
00:23:08,206 --> 00:23:10,200
Since now.

331
00:23:12,282 --> 00:23:13,751
You didn't need to do that.

332
00:23:13,786 --> 00:23:15,757
Don't tell me what I need.

333
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,758
Miles...

334
00:23:16,793 --> 00:23:18,456
Don't "Miles" me!

335
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:19,761
I'm sick of it!

336
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,602
I'm sick of this place,
I'm sick of your drawing

337
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,508
and most of all,
I am sick of you!

338
00:23:24,545 --> 00:23:25,707
Try to be calm.

339
00:23:25,748 --> 00:23:28,277
I don't want to be calm!

340
00:23:28,321 --> 00:23:30,451
I've had it with this place.

341
00:23:31,863 --> 00:23:33,162
I don't belong here!

342
00:23:34,569 --> 00:23:36,437
Do you hear me?!

343
00:23:36,473 --> 00:23:38,376
I don't belong here.

344
00:23:38,412 --> 00:23:39,711
I didn't do anything wrong.

345
00:23:39,748 --> 00:23:41,047
I know you're listening!

346
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:42,053
Miles...

347
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,716
I don't belong here!

348
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:45,021
Let me out of here!

349
00:23:45,061 --> 00:23:48,331
I didn't do anything wrong,
and you know it!

350
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:50,670
All offenders
in Detention Area Four

351
00:23:50,707 --> 00:23:53,737
if you do not cease
this disturbance immediately

352
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:55,250
you will be disciplined.

353
00:23:55,286 --> 00:23:56,380
Discipline this!

354
00:23:56,421 --> 00:23:57,515
Miles!

355
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,300
Be quiet!

356
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,413
Chief, how are you doing?

357
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,250
I wish people would stop
asking me that...

358
00:24:13,596 --> 00:24:17,298
I'm sorry, Constable,
uh, everything's fine.

359
00:24:17,338 --> 00:24:19,605
I've just had a tough day.

360
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:32,634
That's one Black Hole
straight up, right?

361
00:24:33,978 --> 00:24:35,242
Synthale, please.

362
00:24:35,282 --> 00:24:37,982
Be right with you, Chief.

363
00:24:48,646 --> 00:24:50,742
Quark, what about that synthale?

364
00:24:50,785 --> 00:24:52,779
Just another minute.

365
00:24:56,298 --> 00:24:57,631
Quark?

366
00:24:57,668 --> 00:25:00,003
Look, Chief, I'm a little busy

367
00:25:00,107 --> 00:25:01,269
right now.

368
00:25:02,981 --> 00:25:05,452
I'm in no mood for games, Quark.

369
00:25:05,487 --> 00:25:07,390
So why don't you
give me my drink

370
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:10,921
or I break every bone
in your worthless little body.

371
00:25:10,966 --> 00:25:11,934
Chief, just because

372
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,837
your life's in
shambles right now...

373
00:25:15,277 --> 00:25:19,276
One synthale coming right up.

374
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,288
Miles?

375
00:25:50,495 --> 00:25:52,489
Ee'Char.

376
00:25:52,533 --> 00:25:54,401
What are you doing here?

377
00:25:54,437 --> 00:25:57,171
I've never really
been gone, have I?

378
00:25:58,447 --> 00:26:00,212
You're not real.

379
00:26:00,251 --> 00:26:02,119
You're just in my head.

380
00:26:02,156 --> 00:26:04,354
That's all I ever was.

381
00:26:04,395 --> 00:26:06,366
But I'm real to you

382
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,029
and that's all that matters.

383
00:26:08,103 --> 00:26:10,267
Go away.

384
00:26:10,308 --> 00:26:11,504
I can't.

385
00:26:11,545 --> 00:26:12,946
I'm your friend.

386
00:26:12,982 --> 00:26:15,010
You need me.

387
00:26:15,053 --> 00:26:17,149
You are the last thing I need.

388
00:26:17,192 --> 00:26:18,422
You're wrong, Miles.

389
00:26:18,462 --> 00:26:20,660
You need me, now more than ever.

390
00:26:50,137 --> 00:26:51,834
What are you doing?

391
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:54,439
I'm going to work.

392
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:56,918
Miles, as your friend

393
00:26:56,954 --> 00:27:00,656
I have to tell you
I'm worried about you.

394
00:27:04,438 --> 00:27:05,839
Don't be.

395
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:06,969
I'm home.

396
00:27:07,012 --> 00:27:08,572
I'm working

397
00:27:08,615 --> 00:27:11,486
and for the first time in
as long as I can remember

398
00:27:11,522 --> 00:27:12,321
I feel good.

399
00:27:12,454 --> 00:27:15,291
Then why am I here?

400
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,892
Sisko to O'Brien.
Please report to my office.

401
00:27:17,934 --> 00:27:19,062
On my way.

402
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:22,009
Look, I don't know
why you're here

403
00:27:22,044 --> 00:27:23,707
and I don't care.

404
00:27:37,648 --> 00:27:38,981
Have a seat.

405
00:27:46,101 --> 00:27:49,006
I understand
you had a confrontation

406
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,739
with Dr. Bashir yesterday.

407
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,908
Oh, that's a...

408
00:27:51,949 --> 00:27:53,077
That was nothing.

409
00:27:53,118 --> 00:27:55,180
Not according to Dr. Bashir.

410
00:27:55,224 --> 00:27:57,127
We had a little argument.

411
00:27:57,162 --> 00:27:59,065
Julian and I are always arguing.

412
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:00,363
According to Constable Odo

413
00:28:00,402 --> 00:28:02,430
you also had
an incident with Quark.

414
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:03,499
Did that little?

415
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:08,279
Look, sir,
I may have let things get

416
00:28:08,321 --> 00:28:10,052
a little out of hand, but...

417
00:28:10,093 --> 00:28:11,528
it won't happen again.

418
00:28:11,563 --> 00:28:12,793
Hmm.

419
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:14,234
Dr. Bashir also tells me

420
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,707
that you've stopped seeing
your counselor.

421
00:28:16,742 --> 00:28:18,234
Sir, I've been very busy lately.

422
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,247
The agreement was

423
00:28:19,282 --> 00:28:20,911
that you were going
to see a counselor

424
00:28:20,952 --> 00:28:21,942
on a regular basis.

425
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,420
You're right.

426
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,989
I'll make an appointment
to go see him tomorrow.

427
00:28:27,034 --> 00:28:28,868
You'll see him today.

428
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:31,410
Immediately.

429
00:28:31,444 --> 00:28:33,847
I have a lot of work
to do today, sir.

430
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,853
The work can wait.

431
00:28:35,888 --> 00:28:39,556
As of now,
you're relieved of duty.

432
00:28:39,597 --> 00:28:41,864
I want you to report
to Counselor Telnorri

433
00:28:41,969 --> 00:28:44,737
and begin attending
daily counseling sessions

434
00:28:44,775 --> 00:28:47,178
for as long as he thinks
it's advisable.

435
00:28:47,215 --> 00:28:50,211
Sir, you're blowing this
all out of proportion.

436
00:28:50,255 --> 00:28:51,986
You know that's not true.

437
00:28:52,026 --> 00:28:53,655
What happened to you
on Argratha

438
00:28:53,697 --> 00:28:56,465
affected you a lot more
than you're willing to admit

439
00:28:56,504 --> 00:28:59,238
and it's not going
to get better overnight

440
00:28:59,277 --> 00:29:01,339
no matter how much
you want it to.

441
00:29:01,383 --> 00:29:02,351
You need help.

442
00:29:02,385 --> 00:29:05,689
Please, Captain.

443
00:29:05,726 --> 00:29:09,030
I'm asking you
as a personal favor to me.

444
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:11,129
Give me one more chance.

445
00:29:13,578 --> 00:29:15,104
I wish I could.

446
00:29:16,786 --> 00:29:18,255
But right now

447
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:21,855
in the judgment of this
station's Chief Medical Officer

448
00:29:21,898 --> 00:29:23,367
you're unfit for duty

449
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:25,895
which means
you're on medical leave

450
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:27,534
effective immediately

451
00:29:27,578 --> 00:29:30,176
and if you don't begin
attending counseling sessions

452
00:29:30,218 --> 00:29:31,551
on a regular basis

453
00:29:31,588 --> 00:29:34,288
and cooperating in every
other way with your physician

454
00:29:34,328 --> 00:29:35,627
I will have no choice

455
00:29:35,664 --> 00:29:37,931
but to have you confined
to the Infirmary.

456
00:29:38,003 --> 00:29:39,302
Is that clear?

457
00:29:40,609 --> 00:29:42,238
Yes, sir.

458
00:29:44,953 --> 00:29:46,422
Dismissed.

459
00:29:56,046 --> 00:29:59,247
Chief, I was just about
to head down to the Replimat...

460
00:29:59,287 --> 00:30:00,620
Not now, Commander.

461
00:30:03,464 --> 00:30:05,367
Promenade.

462
00:30:12,386 --> 00:30:14,687
What the hell
did you say to him?!

463
00:30:14,724 --> 00:30:16,854
I take it you talked
to Captain Sisko.

464
00:30:16,896 --> 00:30:18,490
I talked to him, all right.

465
00:30:18,533 --> 00:30:19,832
He relieved me of duty.

466
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,169
It's for the best, Miles.

467
00:30:21,207 --> 00:30:23,371
How do you know
what's best for me?

468
00:30:23,412 --> 00:30:25,976
You have no idea
what I've been going through!

469
00:30:26,018 --> 00:30:28,012
You're right.
You were alone in that cell.

470
00:30:28,057 --> 00:30:29,253
I wasn't there with you.

471
00:30:29,292 --> 00:30:30,852
I didn't see
what they did to you

472
00:30:30,897 --> 00:30:32,196
but I do know you suffered

473
00:30:32,234 --> 00:30:33,430
and that you're
still suffering now

474
00:30:33,469 --> 00:30:34,631
and I'm trying to help.

475
00:30:34,672 --> 00:30:36,403
I never asked for your help.

476
00:30:36,443 --> 00:30:37,969
You didn't need to ask.

477
00:30:38,014 --> 00:30:40,178
I'm your doctor
and your friend.

478
00:30:40,219 --> 00:30:42,349
You should listen to him, Miles.

479
00:30:42,391 --> 00:30:43,587
He cares about you

480
00:30:43,627 --> 00:30:44,617
just like I did.

481
00:30:44,663 --> 00:30:46,964
Don't make
the same mistake with him

482
00:30:47,002 --> 00:30:48,061
you did with me.

483
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:51,505
Don't you get it?

484
00:30:51,546 --> 00:30:53,209
You're not my friend!

485
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,275
Not anymore!

486
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,055
The O'Brien that was your friend
died in that cell!

487
00:30:58,095 --> 00:30:59,257
He's not dead.

488
00:30:59,298 --> 00:31:03,000
He just needs a little help,
that's all.

489
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:05,410
Stay away from me.

490
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,351
I don't want your help,
I don't want your friendship

491
00:31:08,386 --> 00:31:10,323
I just want to be left alone!

492
00:31:13,098 --> 00:31:14,397
Where are you going?

493
00:31:14,435 --> 00:31:15,904
I told you to go away!

494
00:31:15,938 --> 00:31:17,373
Miles, please, don't do this.

495
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:19,276
Go back there and talk to him.

496
00:31:19,312 --> 00:31:20,542
He wants to help you.

497
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:21,550
Like you did?

498
00:31:21,585 --> 00:31:22,553
That's right.

499
00:31:22,587 --> 00:31:23,886
We're both your friends.

500
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:26,054
Yeah... and look
what happened to you.

501
00:31:26,096 --> 00:31:27,656
Habitat Ring.

502
00:31:34,382 --> 00:31:35,851
You know, sooner or later

503
00:31:35,886 --> 00:31:38,050
you'll have to tell
someone about me.

504
00:31:38,091 --> 00:31:39,651
Like hell I will.

505
00:31:40,663 --> 00:31:43,192
You can't run from me forever.

506
00:31:44,507 --> 00:31:45,737
You're dead

507
00:31:45,776 --> 00:31:48,408
so why don't you go away
and leave me alone?

508
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:49,748
You want me to leave?

509
00:31:49,786 --> 00:31:50,754
I'll leave!

510
00:31:50,788 --> 00:31:52,087
Send me away!

511
00:31:52,124 --> 00:31:53,525
Don't you see?

512
00:31:53,561 --> 00:31:54,860
If I keep coming back

513
00:31:54,898 --> 00:31:58,236
it's because some part of you
keeps bringing me here!

514
00:32:13,877 --> 00:32:16,611
Miles, Julian's been trying
to contact you for an hour.

515
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:17,675
Where have you been?

516
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:19,656
Walking. Thinking.

517
00:32:19,691 --> 00:32:21,422
I know. I heard.

518
00:32:21,461 --> 00:32:22,429
I'm sorry.

519
00:32:22,464 --> 00:32:25,198
I know how much
your work means to you.

520
00:32:25,271 --> 00:32:26,638
Try telling that to Julian.

521
00:32:26,674 --> 00:32:29,168
Daddy, come see what I drew.

522
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:31,343
Not now, honey, okay?

523
00:32:31,385 --> 00:32:32,854
I'm sure it's only temporary.

524
00:32:32,889 --> 00:32:35,122
You'll be back at work
before you know it.

525
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,687
Daddy, you have to come see.

526
00:32:36,732 --> 00:32:38,600
Look, can we talk
about this later?

527
00:32:38,636 --> 00:32:39,764
Daddy, come on!

528
00:32:39,805 --> 00:32:40,773
Not now.

529
00:32:40,807 --> 00:32:41,969
Please, Daddy, please!

530
00:32:42,011 --> 00:32:43,845
I said not now, right?!

531
00:32:43,882 --> 00:32:44,850
- I said not!
- Miles!

532
00:32:44,884 --> 00:32:45,943
What are you doing?!

533
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,856
Oh, shh, shh.

534
00:32:52,302 --> 00:32:53,566
I didn't mean to...

535
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:55,131
Shh.

536
00:32:56,645 --> 00:32:58,137
I'm sorry.

537
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:25,021
Chief?

538
00:34:28,238 --> 00:34:30,141
Get out of here, Julian.

539
00:34:31,847 --> 00:34:34,752
You don't want to do this,
Chief.

540
00:34:34,788 --> 00:34:36,314
The hell I don't.

541
00:34:38,964 --> 00:34:41,903
Look, I don't claim to know
what you're going through

542
00:34:41,938 --> 00:34:44,467
but whatever it is,
it's not worth dying for.

543
00:34:46,749 --> 00:34:49,243
You don't understand at all.

544
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:53,591
I'm not doing this for me.

545
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,104
I'm doing it
to protect Keiko and Molly

546
00:34:56,138 --> 00:34:58,268
and everyone else
in this station.

547
00:34:58,311 --> 00:35:00,008
Protect us from what?

548
00:35:00,048 --> 00:35:01,347
From me.

549
00:35:03,556 --> 00:35:07,521
I'm not the man I used to be.

550
00:35:07,565 --> 00:35:09,468
I'm dangerous.

551
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,608
I nearly hit Molly today.

552
00:35:15,652 --> 00:35:18,489
All she wanted
was a little attention

553
00:35:18,526 --> 00:35:21,864
and I nearly hit her.

554
00:35:21,901 --> 00:35:23,461
But you didn't.

555
00:35:25,075 --> 00:35:27,707
You're a good man,
Miles Edward O'Brien

556
00:35:27,748 --> 00:35:31,018
and whatever it is you think
you've done wrong

557
00:35:31,122 --> 00:35:32,716
you don't deserve to die.

558
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,754
You sound like Ee'Char.

559
00:35:34,798 --> 00:35:36,826
Who's Ee'Char?

560
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:42,242
He's... not real.

561
00:35:46,593 --> 00:35:48,860
He's just a memory, that's all.

562
00:35:48,898 --> 00:35:51,700
A memory from Argratha?

563
00:35:51,738 --> 00:35:53,071
Who was he?

564
00:35:53,175 --> 00:35:54,200
Another prisoner?

565
00:35:54,245 --> 00:35:55,304
A guard?

566
00:35:55,347 --> 00:35:57,979
He was my cell mate.

567
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:01,187
You told me you were alone
in that cell.

568
00:36:01,227 --> 00:36:03,391
20 years with no one to talk to.

569
00:36:10,116 --> 00:36:12,782
I was at the end...

570
00:36:12,823 --> 00:36:15,421
a week...

571
00:36:15,462 --> 00:36:16,795
two maybe.

572
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:21,405
But the rest of the time...

573
00:36:22,612 --> 00:36:24,309
there was Ee'Char.

574
00:36:26,388 --> 00:36:27,755
What happened to him?

575
00:36:34,174 --> 00:36:35,473
Ah...

576
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,036
Why'd you do that?

577
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,831
It wasn't helping.

578
00:36:45,868 --> 00:36:47,462
You need to concentrate more.

579
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:50,501
It doesn't matter
how much I concentrate.

580
00:36:50,546 --> 00:36:52,414
I'm still starving.

581
00:36:55,825 --> 00:36:57,055
So am I.

582
00:36:57,095 --> 00:36:59,795
You sure there's nothing left?

583
00:36:59,834 --> 00:37:02,966
Not unless you have a hiding
place I don't know about.

584
00:37:03,009 --> 00:37:06,039
We ate the last of the food
I put away a week ago.

585
00:37:08,523 --> 00:37:11,496
We should have stockpiled more.

586
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,763
We should have prepared
for this.

587
00:37:13,802 --> 00:37:17,436
They've never let us go
this long without food before.

588
00:37:17,477 --> 00:37:20,575
Maybe they've forgotten
about us

589
00:37:20,618 --> 00:37:23,352
or just decided to finally
let us die.

590
00:37:26,164 --> 00:37:28,101
Then we die.

591
00:37:28,136 --> 00:37:31,440
All offenders prepare
for dormancy period.

592
00:37:31,478 --> 00:37:34,542
Any offender still active
during the dormancy period

593
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,884
will be disciplined.

594
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:39,521
Illumination will be suspended
in 20 seconds.

595
00:37:39,563 --> 00:37:41,466
What are you doing?

596
00:37:41,502 --> 00:37:43,302
I'm going to sleep.

597
00:37:43,339 --> 00:37:46,039
How can you sleep
at a time like this?

598
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,315
Maybe I'll dream about food.

599
00:37:49,354 --> 00:37:51,382
You're crazy.

600
00:37:51,426 --> 00:37:53,693
No...

601
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:55,668
just hungry.

602
00:37:55,703 --> 00:37:58,106
Dormancy period initiated.

603
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,177
You pretended to be my friend

604
00:38:58,219 --> 00:39:00,783
and all the time you were
holding out on me.

605
00:39:00,825 --> 00:39:02,728
Now who's acting crazy?

606
00:39:09,913 --> 00:39:11,713
After everything
I've done for you

607
00:39:11,751 --> 00:39:12,616
you ungrateful...

608
00:39:44,028 --> 00:39:47,001
You...

609
00:39:47,035 --> 00:39:49,701
you were saving it
for both of us.

610
00:39:57,059 --> 00:39:58,859
Ee'Char.

611
00:40:01,403 --> 00:40:04,035
Ee'Char, wake up.

612
00:40:14,602 --> 00:40:16,937
Ee'Char... Ee'Char...

613
00:40:20,014 --> 00:40:21,449
You killed him?

614
00:40:25,194 --> 00:40:28,464
The worst part of it was...

615
00:40:28,535 --> 00:40:32,568
the next day, the guards
began feeding me again.

616
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,478
I killed him for nothing...

617
00:40:36,554 --> 00:40:40,427
for a scrap of bread
he was going to share with me.

618
00:40:40,464 --> 00:40:41,660
But it was a mistake.

619
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,135
You didn't mean it.

620
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:47,339
I meant it.

621
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,851
I wanted him to die.

622
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,527
I keep telling myself...

623
00:40:55,266 --> 00:40:56,530
it doesn't matter.

624
00:40:56,602 --> 00:40:58,367
It wasn't real.

625
00:40:58,406 --> 00:40:59,932
But that's a lie.

626
00:40:59,977 --> 00:41:02,882
If it had been real,
if it had been you

627
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:04,820
instead of him

628
00:41:04,855 --> 00:41:06,849
it wouldn't have made
any difference.

629
00:41:06,894 --> 00:41:08,990
He was my best friend

630
00:41:09,032 --> 00:41:11,561
and I murdered him.

631
00:41:13,576 --> 00:41:17,518
When we were growing up,
they used to tell us...

632
00:41:17,586 --> 00:41:20,491
humanity had evolved

633
00:41:20,526 --> 00:41:24,866
that mankind had outgrown
hate and rage.

634
00:41:28,212 --> 00:41:31,185
But when it came down to it

635
00:41:31,219 --> 00:41:33,190
when I had the chance to show

636
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:35,788
that no matter what anyone
did to me

637
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:38,563
I was still an evolved
human being...

638
00:41:40,574 --> 00:41:41,907
I failed.

639
00:41:45,553 --> 00:41:48,583
I repaid kindness with blood.

640
00:41:52,269 --> 00:41:54,295
I was no better than an animal.

641
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:55,624
No. No, no, no.

642
00:41:55,665 --> 00:41:57,294
An animal
would've killed Ee'Char

643
00:41:57,335 --> 00:42:00,433
and never had a second thought,
never shed a tear

644
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:01,673
but not you.

645
00:42:01,712 --> 00:42:03,204
You hate yourself.

646
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:07,215
You hate yourself so much
you think you deserve to die.

647
00:42:07,259 --> 00:42:09,696
The Argrathi did
everything they could

648
00:42:09,732 --> 00:42:11,361
to strip you of your humanity

649
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:14,069
and in the end,
for one brief moment

650
00:42:14,109 --> 00:42:15,339
they succeeded.

651
00:42:15,379 --> 00:42:17,748
But you can't let
that brief moment

652
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,277
define your entire life.

653
00:42:19,321 --> 00:42:21,953
If you do,
if you pull that trigger

654
00:42:21,995 --> 00:42:24,832
then the Argrathi will have won.

655
00:42:24,868 --> 00:42:28,775
They will have
destroyed a good man.

656
00:42:28,811 --> 00:42:32,582
You cannot let that happen,
my friend.

657
00:42:45,785 --> 00:42:47,619
Miles.

658
00:42:49,862 --> 00:42:51,730
Be well, Miles.

659
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:17,986
30 milligrams twice a day.

660
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:19,259
Take it religiously
for a month.

661
00:43:19,299 --> 00:43:20,267
And if all goes well

662
00:43:20,301 --> 00:43:21,565
we'll experiment
with a lower dosage.

663
00:43:21,604 --> 00:43:22,629
You sure this'll work?

664
00:43:22,674 --> 00:43:24,337
It's a treatment, not a cure.

665
00:43:24,377 --> 00:43:25,869
It'll prevent hallucinations

666
00:43:25,914 --> 00:43:27,383
take the edge off the depression

667
00:43:27,418 --> 00:43:28,546
but that's all it'll do.

668
00:43:28,588 --> 00:43:30,889
It won't take away
the memories or the feelings.

669
00:43:30,926 --> 00:43:31,894
You mean the guilt.

670
00:43:31,929 --> 00:43:34,800
Well, that'll take time.

671
00:43:34,836 --> 00:43:37,000
Now's the part where you tell me

672
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:39,809
I have to start seeing
Counselor Telnorri again.

673
00:43:39,848 --> 00:43:42,115
Unless you want to talk to me.

674
00:43:42,187 --> 00:43:44,385
Telnorri'll be fine.

675
00:43:49,805 --> 00:43:51,240
Thanks, Julian...

676
00:43:51,275 --> 00:43:52,300
for everything.

677
00:43:52,344 --> 00:43:54,144
What are friends for?

678
00:44:03,505 --> 00:44:06,637
Daddy's home!
Daddy's home!

679
00:44:13,862 --> 00:44:15,126
That's right.

680
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:17,170
Daddy's home.
