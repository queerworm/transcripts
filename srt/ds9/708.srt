Ha...

14
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,366
So, what do
you think?

15
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,534
Not bad.

16
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,369
But the lady
is a "tramp"

17
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,370
not a scamp.

18
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,579
Tramp, right.

19
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,707
So, do I get the... "gig"?

20
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:41,834
Sorry, pally.

21
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:44,169
But Dr. Bashir said you're
looking for an opening act

22
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,754
and I love to sing.

23
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:48,799
I can tell, but two singers
on the same bill--

24
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,592
that's a one-way ticket
to Deadsville.

25
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,636
I need someone to warm
up the audience for me.

26
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:53,971
You know, a comic.

27
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,389
A comic?

28
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,474
A comedian. Someone
who can make people laugh.

29
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,226
I can do that--
my brother tells me

30
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:00,686
people are always
laughing at me.

31
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:02,021
Well, that may be true

32
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:04,606
but this is a holosuite program,
<i>capisce?</i>

33
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,983
So?

34
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,442
So, you're not a hologram.

35
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:10,237
Life can be so unfair.

36
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,572
Vic, you got a minute?

37
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:12,573
Forget it.

38
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,741
He's not hiring.

39
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,117
What's wrong with him?

40
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,870
Show biz. It can
break your heart.

41
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,454
So, what can I do
for you, pally?

42
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,622
Uh, did you get
a chance to make

43
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,790
those audio
recordings for me?

44
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,251
All your favorite hits.

45
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,003
That's great.
Thanks, Vic.

46
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,004
My pleasure.

47
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,964
These songs are 400 years old.

48
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:30,089
You sure the troops
on the front lines

49
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,090
want to hear them?

50
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,551
Well, the songs may be old

51
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,219
but when you sing them,
they sound brand new.

52
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,971
Hey, when you
put it that way

53
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:38,139
I wish I was going on
the supply run with you.

54
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,975
I could make some
personal appearances.

55
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,602
Sing a few songs,
tell a few jokes.

56
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,729
You know, put on
a regular USO show.

57
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,230
I'm afraid
there are no holosuites

58
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,399
where we're going.

59
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,316
Rom's right.

60
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,110
Life<i> can</i> be unfair.

61
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,653
You know, pally

62
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,739
sometimes being
a hologram

63
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,658
can be a real pain
in the asometric photons.

64
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,827
I'll see you when I get back.

65
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,705
Well, you know where to find me.

66
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,798
(<i> door opening</i> )

67
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,136
I thought I might
find you here.

68
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:20,557
The new security protocols
you requested.

69
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,976
I think that's
what I'm going

70
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:24,853
to remember most
about this war--

71
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,606
looking through
casualty reports.

72
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,776
Sometimes it feels like
that's all I do...

73
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:33,320
stare at the names
of the dead.

74
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,909
When the war started,
I read every name.

75
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,871
I felt it was the
least I could do

76
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,498
to honor their
sacrifices.

77
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,378
But now...

78
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,799
the names have begun
to blur together.

79
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,051
Well, that's
understandable.

80
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,888
Maybe.

81
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,890
KIRA<i> ( on com</i> ):
Ops to Captain Sisko.

82
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,224
Go ahead.

83
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,060
The<i> Defiant</i> is ready
for departure.

84
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,855
On my way.

85
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,575
Why me?

86
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,578
Why did he have to send me?

87
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,081
I'm like a son to him.

88
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,249
EZRI:
Quark, you're
mumbling again.

89
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,292
I'm sorry.

90
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,585
It's...

91
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,922
it's just not fair.

92
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,924
I have responsibilities
of my own

93
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,342
customers who depend on me.

94
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:42,014
But the Grand
Nagus picked<i> you</i>

95
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:43,557
for this assignment.

96
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,017
Some assignment...

97
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:48,520
a fact-finding mission
to the front lines.

98
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:53,483
Zek's already inundated with
Starfleet Intelligence reports.

99
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,569
What could I tell him
that he doesn't know?

100
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,946
Maybe he wants
to hear things

101
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,656
from a Ferengi
perspective.

102
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,867
Then let him ask Nog.

103
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,661
The Nagus trusts<i> you.</i>

104
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,541
What are you
trying to do?

105
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,376
Cheer me up?

106
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,461
It's my job.

107
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:16,381
Remember the 34th Rule
of Acquisition.

108
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,591
"War is good for business."

109
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,467
Only from a distance.

110
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,636
The closer you are
to the front lines

111
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,181
the less profitable it gets.

112
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,058
(<i> explosion</i> )

113
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,142
(<i> alarm blares</i> )

114
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,143
What is that?

115
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,895
Stay here.

116
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,564
Wait! Don't leave!

117
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,997
This is no time
to be wandering
the corridors.

118
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,709
I thought the Chin'toka System
was in Federation hands.

119
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,710
It is, but the Dominion
is determined

120
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,003
to take back
their territory.

121
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:55,963
The whole system's
a battleground.

122
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,089
(<i> yells</i> )

123
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:58,257
Thank you.

124
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:00,884
I should probably
write this down.

125
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:11,352
Mr. O'Brien, keep an eye out
for more Jem'Hadar ships.

126
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,896
Aye, sir.

127
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,612
What are you doing
here, Uncle?

128
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,990
I'm... visiting.

129
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,449
I'm working.

130
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,659
Quark, is there something
we can do for you?

131
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,035
Not really.

132
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,997
I just came by to say
hello to my nephew.

133
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,791
All right. You've
just said hello.

134
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,628
Anybody here who would
like to join me

135
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:37,796
in the mess hall
for a<i> raktajino?</i>

136
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,798
Quark.

137
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,091
I'm just leaving.

138
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,975
Sir, I assure you that
won't happen again.

139
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:56,940
Nog, your uncle's just
a little nervous.

140
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,109
He's not used to being
in a combat situation.

141
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,986
That's no excuse.

142
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,751
Captain, the supplies
are ready for transport.

143
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,461
WORF:
AR-558

144
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,504
has acknowledged
your message.

145
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,588
They are expecting you.

146
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,174
Away team,
you're with me.

147
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:23,175
Mr. Worf, she's
all yours.

148
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:24,509
WORF:
Aye, sir.

149
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,621
Not much to look at, is it?

150
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,836
Those are Federation phasers.

151
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,672
Hold your fire!

152
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:11,885
I'm Captain Benjamin Sisko
of the USS<i> Defiant.</i>

153
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,178
WOMAN:
You heard him!

154
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,346
Cease fire, damn it!

155
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,978
We're coming out!

156
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,291
Who told you
to open fire?

157
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,584
I saw movement.

158
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,378
I thought it was
the Jem'Hadar.

159
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:47,546
They look like
Jem'Hadar to you?

160
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:48,838
I gave the word

161
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,174
to hold your fire;
that Starfleet Officers

162
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,633
were beaming down
with supplies.

163
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,593
Well, nobody told me.

164
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,677
(<i> sighs</i> )

165
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:55,887
Sorry, Captain--

166
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,432
a little breakdown
in communications.

167
00:09:58,432 --> 00:09:59,599
No harm was done.

168
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,184
Where's Captain Loomis?

169
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,520
He was killed
ten days ago.

170
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,772
So was
Commander Parker.

171
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,607
Who's in command?

172
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,608
I am.

173
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,901
Lieutenant Nadia Larkin.

174
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:10,985
Ben Sisko.

175
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,904
Where do you want
your supplies?

176
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,948
Vargas can show you.

177
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,616
Supplies...
that's great.

178
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,076
Don't they know we need

179
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,494
to get off
this rock?

180
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:20,620
Take it easy, Vargas.

181
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,122
Take it easy?

182
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,664
I would love to
take it easy.

183
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,166
Get me out of
this vole hole

184
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,834
and I promise you for
the rest of my life

185
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,336
all I'll do is
just take it easy.

186
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,671
According
to Starfleet regulations

187
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,799
we're supposed to be rotated

188
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,802
off the front lines
after 90 days.<i> 90 days.</i>

189
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:38,721
We've been stuck

190
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,766
on this rock
for five months, Captain.

191
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,602
Take it easy.

192
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,772
Welcome to paradise, Captain.

193
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,861
There it is--
the only reason

194
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,197
anyone gives a damn
about this place.

195
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,449
It's the
largest Dominion

196
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,451
communications array
in the sector.

197
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,161
If we can figure
out how it works

198
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,496
we should be
able to tap

199
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,788
into their entire
com system.

200
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,165
One thing's
for sure--

201
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,833
they're determined
to get it back.

202
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,293
We can't let that happen.

203
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,086
I know our
orders, Captain

204
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,463
but maybe
Starfleet Command

205
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,548
isn't aware
of<i> our</i> situation.

206
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,301
We've been holding this place
for five months--

207
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,470
that's five months
of fighting off

208
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,264
repeated Jem'Hadar
attempts to get it back.

209
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,808
When we landed here,
there were 150 of us.

210
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:24,976
We're down to 43.

211
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,104
I appreciate
what you've gone through

212
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,439
and I will make sure

213
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,441
that Starfleet understands
your situation

214
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,900
but from what I hear

215
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,362
our forces are spread
pretty thin in this system.

216
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,531
Chances are,
you're going to be stuck here

217
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:38,490
for a while longer.

218
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,824
Lucky us.

219
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,666
Can someone hand me
a duonetic coupler?

220
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,339
Thanks.

221
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,300
Your frequency
discriminator seems

222
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,343
to be drifting.

223
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,303
You might want to reset it.

224
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,680
You an engineer?

225
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,517
No... but Tobin,
one of my previous hosts, was.

226
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:06,518
Close enough.

227
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,395
Pick up a microdyne coupler

228
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,813
and start recalibrating
that transtator.

229
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,495
(<i> whispering</i> ):
Nog, shouldn't you be

230
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,039
helping Dr. Bashir
unload the supplies?

231
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,458
(<i> whispering</i> ):
We're pretty
much finished.

232
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,168
Good.

233
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,421
The sooner we get
out of here, the better.

234
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:40,510
That soldier over there,
you see his necklace?

235
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,222
Those are
ketracel-white tubes.

236
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,350
QUARK:
So?

237
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,851
You know how
he got them?

238
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,395
Mail order?

239
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:54,482
He took them off the bodies
of dead Jem'Hadar--

240
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,693
Jem'Hadar that<i> he</i> killed.

241
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,195
It's his way of
keeping score.

242
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,905
And you find that
impressive?

243
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,323
Isn't it?

244
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,742
I don't think so.

245
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,247
Take a look
around you, Nog.

246
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,750
This isn't
the Starfleet you know.

247
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,543
Sure it is.

248
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:18,005
It's just that these people
have been through a lot.

249
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:21,259
They've been holed up here
a long time...

250
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,802
seen two-thirds
of their unit killed

251
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,930
but they haven't surrendered...

252
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,434
and do you know why?

253
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,314
Because they're heroes.

254
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,190
Maybe, but I still
don't want you

255
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,233
anywhere near them.

256
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,526
(<i> dismissive snort</i> )

257
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,032
Let me tell you something
about hu-mans, Nephew.

258
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,704
They're a wonderful,
friendly people

259
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,706
as long
as their bellies are full

260
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,458
and their holosuites
are working...

261
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,464
but take away
their creature comforts

262
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:03,510
deprive them of food,

263
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,680
sleep, sonic showers...

264
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,642
put their lives in jeopardy
over an extended period of time

265
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:16,230
and those same, friendly,
intelligent, wonderful people

266
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:21,820
will become as nasty
and as violent

267
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,698
as the most
bloodthirsty Klingon.

268
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:27,408
You don't believe me?

269
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,287
Look at those faces.

270
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,499
Look in their eyes.

271
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,919
You know I'm right,
don't you?

272
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,674
Well...

273
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,342
aren't you going
to say something?

274
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,056
I feel sorry for the Jem'Hadar.

275
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:14,288
BASHIR:
This is 20cc's
of numinol tetraminothen.

276
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,377
That'll take care of the fever
and the chest congestion.

277
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:22,797
This... will get rid
of the dermal irritation

278
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,549
on your back.

279
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,342
Better?

280
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,720
Oh... are you kidding?

281
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,929
I haven't felt this good

282
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,598
since the day I landed
on this rock.

283
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,475
Good. Now, I'd like
to take a look at this arm.

284
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,478
What the hell
are you doing?

285
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,355
You keep your hands
off this bandage.

286
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,608
I need to treat your wound.

287
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,110
Nobody touches
this bandage.

288
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,236
Is that understood?

289
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,320
Why is that?

290
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,573
I asked you if
you understood.

291
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:49,741
Yes.

292
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,294
McGreevey put
this bandage on me.

293
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:04,004
He ripped up his own uniform
to make it.

294
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,716
He sounds like a good friend.

295
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:07,842
He was a jerk.

296
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:08,843
I couldn't stand

297
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:09,844
the guy.

298
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,387
He wouldn't shut up.

299
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,388
Yap, yap, yap.

300
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,890
He thought he was

301
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,267
the world's greatest authority
on everything.

302
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:24,108
I know... he's dead,
and I should have more respect

303
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,486
but God, I hated him.

304
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,113
One minute, he's tying
this bandage around my arm

305
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,157
talking his head off

306
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,618
and the next minute,
he's lying flat on his back

307
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:35,286
with a hole in his chest...

308
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:42,710
(<i> voice breaking</i> ):
and I just sat there
and I looked at him.

309
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,420
It was so great.

310
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,633
He was so quiet!

311
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,470
One time in his life,
he's quiet!

312
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,477
(<i> sniffling</i> )

313
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,904
I still need
to treat your wound.

314
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,539
(<i> Vargas softly groaning</i> )

315
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,127
SISKO:
I think you've set up a
solid defense perimeter

316
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,087
but you need to
tighten this flank.

317
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,007
Captain, can I
have a minute?

318
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,971
These people's physical
and mental health

319
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,514
is precarious at best.

320
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,224
They need more than
a few food replicators

321
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,433
and medical supplies.

322
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,643
They need to be
shipped out of here.

323
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,102
I understand that,
but right now

324
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,479
there's nothing I can do
about that.

325
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,023
(<i> explosion</i> )

326
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:46,190
Damn it!

(<i> people calling out</i> )

328
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,370
I saw it happen.

329
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,621
He was walking along...

330
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,373

You must have swept
the compound

331
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:03,374
for antipersonnel mines.

332
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:04,667
A hundred times.

333
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,502
It doesn't help,
not with Houdinis.

334
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,046
Houdinis?

335
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,006
Find one and you disappear.

336
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,926
They hide in subspace
and appear at random.

337
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,177
You can walk by the same
place a hundred times

338
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,304
and nothing happens,
and then, bang.

339
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,724
You're wasting
your breath, Vargas.

340
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:22,435
It's not the Captain's problem.

341
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,353
He's leaving.

00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,776
I wish I could tell you

00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,527
things were going
to get easier for you.

00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,227
Good luck.

363
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,400
What are you looking at?

364
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,485
We have work to do.

365
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,361
Yes, sir.

366
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,114
(<i> loudly</i> ):
You heard the Captain.

367
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:19,199
(<i> softer</i> ):
Sir, what are your orders?

368
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,285
There's only one order,
Lieutenant.

369
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:24,831
We hold.

370
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,520
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

371
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,563
We need to find out how many
Jem'Hadar troops landed

372
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,982
and where they are.

373
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:52,025
Well, you're not going
to learn anything

374
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,275
with a tricorder.

375
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,735
We jam their sensors,
they jam ours.

376
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,236
That's how it works.

377
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,031
Except they have
an advantage--

378
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,365
they know where we are.

379
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,117
But that's all they know.

380
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,994
They don't know
our defense position

381
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,662
or how many of us
there are.

382
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,039
All things considered

383
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,207
I'd still rather be
in their shoes.

384
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:12,962
(<i> whispering</i> ):
Anything, Ensign?

385
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,715
Plenty. I can hear Vargas'
stomach grumbling

386
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,051
and Ezri tuning
a phase amplifier

387
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,094
with a coil spanner in
the communications bunker.

388
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,013
What about the Jem'Hadar?

389
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,764
Not a sound.

390
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,225
If they're out there,
they're being very quiet.

391
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,685
They're out there.

392
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,395
(<i> intermittent</i>
<i>high-pitched whirring</i> )

393
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:31,981
(<i> whirring</i> )

394
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,067
Keep your ears open, Ensign.

395
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,526
I will, sir.

396
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,909
See anything?

397
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,035
Uh-uh.

398
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,205
That knife you're working on...

399
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:48,956
it's not
Starfleet issue.

400
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,876
Can I see it?

401
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,503
You're supposed to be listening
for the Jem'Hadar.

402
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,047
I know.

403
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,840
Then shut up and listen.

404
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,509
LARKIN:
Here they come.

405
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,577
There's something wrong.

406
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:29,371
They're not firing.

407
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,708
Hold your fire!

408
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,130
Wh-where'd they go?

409
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,590
SISKO:
They weren't here to begin with.

410
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,967
Holograms.

411
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,635
I don't understand.

412
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,929
It was a way for them to see
what they were up against

413
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,806
determine our numbers.

414
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,975
And pinpoint our positions.

415
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:52,394
(<i> sighing</i> ):
Without risking
any casualties-- smart.

416
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,687
Oh, yeah. They're
smart, all right

417
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,773
and we're as
good as dead!

418
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,817
Not yet we aren't.

419
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:58,818
Is it over?!

420
00:21:58,818 --> 00:21:59,819
SISKO:
For now.

421
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:00,987
But the next time

422
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:03,405
they won't send holograms.

423
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,075
(<i> explosion</i> )

424
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,413
Get that stretcher.

425
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,581
Let's get him to the Infirmary.

426
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,543
EZRI:
Does that mean we stop

427
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,378
working on
the communications array?

428
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,798
They'll have to get along
without you for a while.

429
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:22,216
We have to find the Houdinis

430
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,342
and disarm them.

431
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,760
I'm all for that.

432
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,971
These mines are a nasty piece
of engineering.

433
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,973
They're also impossible
to detect.

434
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:30,557
I'm sorry, Captain

435
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,768
but I'm an engineer,
not a magician.

436
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,104
Larkin says
you like a challenge.

437
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:38,316
I thought I did,
but after banging my head

438
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:40,609
against that
communications array

439
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,821
for the last few months,
I'm not so sure anymore.

440
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:46,324
EZRI:
He's just being
modest, Captain.

441
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:49,118
Chief O'Brien would be proud
to have him on his crew.

442
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,454
I can't think of higher praise.

443
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,666
(<i> clears throat</i> )

444
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,501
Now what?

445
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,586
Now we get to pull a rabbit

446
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:00,754
out of our hat.

447
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,761
(<i> panting</i> )

448
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,387
Here.

449
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:11,849
You need to keep
your strength up.

450
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:14,977
Thanks, Uncle, but I
can get my own food.

451
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,646
What's the matter?

452
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,733
Afraid of looking weak
in front of the hu-mans?

453
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,400
I want to earn
their respect

454
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,944
if that's what
you mean.

455
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,613
At the price of your soul?

456
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,870
Look at you--
you hold that phaser rifle

457
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,621
as if it were made
of pure latinum.

458
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,498
We're in the middle of a war

459
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,709
and this rifle
can keep me alive.

460
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,836
I'm a Starfleet Officer.

461
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,420
You're a<i> Ferengi</i>

462
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,506
and I wish
you'd start acting like one.

463
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,593
You mean, hiding under a rock
every time trouble starts?

464
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,890
I'll tell you one thing,
Nephew--

465
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,310
if the Federation had listened
to the Ferengi Alliance

466
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,771
there never would have been
a war.

467
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:01,732
Because we would have
surrendered a long time ago.

468
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:05,527
No.<i> We</i> would have reached
an accommodation.

469
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,364
We would have sat down
across a negotiation table

470
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:11,033
and hammered out
a peace treaty.

471
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,246
One that both sides
could live with.

472
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:17,415
You make it sound so simple.

473
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:19,541
Rule of Acquisition 125:

474
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,877
"You can't make a deal
if you're dead."

475
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,963
SISKO:
Nog.

476
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,589
I'm sending you,
Larkin and Reese

477
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,632
out on a scouting patrol.

478
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:27,883
Yes, sir.

479
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,885
I need to know what
I'm up against--

480
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,429
how many Jem'Hadar
are out there

481
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:32,721
where they're camped

482
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,181
and what kind of weapons
they have with them.

483
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,224
When do we leave?

484
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,183
Right away.

485
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,684
QUARK:
Hold on a minute!

486
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,604
Why Nog, when you have

487
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,106
all these veterans
to choose from?

488
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:43,649
No one asked
your opinion.

489
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:46,110
Our tricorders
aren't working.

490
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,278
But my hearing is.

491
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:48,654
SISKO:
Exactly.

492
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:49,947
You can count on me, sir.

493
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:50,948
I'll find the Jem'Hadar.

494
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:51,991
LARKIN:
Let's go.

495
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,951
Nog, wait a minute...

496
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,786
He has his orders, Quark.

497
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,584
That is so easy
for you to say.

498
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,381
But I bet you wouldn't
send Jake out there.

499
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:10,759
Jake is not a
Starfleet Officer.

500
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:43,459
(<i> clicking</i> )

501
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:47,545
(<i> beeping</i> )

502
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:48,922
You did it.

503
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,427
Actually, I'm not sure
it was me.

504
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:55,054
It could have been
Tobin or Jadzia.

505
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,389
It doesn't matter.

506
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:57,555
The point is, you managed

507
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,099
to cut through
the jamming signals.

508
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:03,187
Unfortunately,
I can't extend its range

509
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:04,646
past a hundred meters.

510
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,691
That's enough to scan
the entire compound.

511
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,861
Now the question is:

512
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,321
How do we calibrate
the tricorder

513
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:15,282
to locate the mines
in subspace?

514
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,659
(<i> sighing</i> )

515
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,537
Maybe we could try
cross-linking

516
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:21,455
the optronic
and isodyne relays.

517
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,583
You're sure
you're not an engineer?

518
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,669
In nine lives, I've been
a little of everything.

519
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:32,632
Doesn't that...
doesn't that get confusing?

520
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,218
You have no idea.

521
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:36,178
Really.

522
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:38,347
I'll give you an example.

523
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:41,641
This is my first time
on the front lines.

524
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,561
You're talking about Ezri now?

525
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:45,354
Right.

526
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:50,692
But Torias, Curzon and Jadzia,
they were in battle many times

527
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:54,280
and I can remember
what that felt like.

528
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,867
I remember the fear
and the anger

529
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,203
and the adrenaline surge.

530
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:04,664
Having someone else's memories
of being in combat is one thing.

531
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,252
Living through it yourself...

532
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:10,463
is another.

533
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:12,923
I suppose I'm going to find out.

534
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:16,843
You'll do fine.

535
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,786
LARKIN:
This is close enough, Nog.

536
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:50,877
What is it?
What's going on?

537
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,505
It's time to go.

538
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,681
Right.

539
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,392
Let's go.

540
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:17,321

545
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,898
Don't shoot!
It's me-- Reese!

546
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,274
SISKO:
Stretcher!

547
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,442
Nog!

548
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,195
What happened?!

549
00:28:58,195 --> 00:28:59,238
REESE:
Jem'Hadar patrol.

550
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,280
Larkin?

551
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,448
She's dead.

552
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,575
Damn!

553
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:04,577
The Ferengi found
the encampment.

554
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:06,745
It's three kilometers
south of here.

555
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,746
How many troops?

556
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,997
Two columns.

557
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,124
How we ever going
to hold off two columns?

558
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,459
We'll have to even
out the odds.

559
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,711
Any ideas?

560
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:14,878
I'm working on it.

561
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,505
Captain...

562
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:17,590
(<i> breathing heavily</i> )

563
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,216
...the kid did all right.

564
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,683
The doctor doesn't want
anybody in there.

565
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:29,518
Well, how's Nog?

566
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:32,438
It's a little late for you
to care about that, isn't it?

567
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:33,480
Quark...

568
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,774
He's going to lose his leg.

569
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,568
Does that answer your question?

570
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,326
Now what happens?

571
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,578
You will be able

572
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:49,204
to replace the leg,
won't you?

573
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,081
As soon as we can get him
to a hospital

574
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:53,459
he can be fitted
with a biosynthetic limb.

575
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:57,170
Unfortunately, there,
uh... may be complications.

576
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,213
What's that supposed to mean?

577
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,715
Nog suffered

578
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:02,384
severe thermal damage
to his femoral motor nerves,

579
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:03,927
and I'm not sure
they'll be able

580
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,471
to stimulate
artificial muscle tissue.

581
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,055
In fact, there's
no way of knowing

582
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,099
until after the operation
has been performed.

583
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,395
I have to get inside.

584
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,401
We've got to get Nog
to a hospital.

585
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:20,694
We will as
soon as we can.

586
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:21,737
That's not good enough.

587
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,447
I'm sorry.

588
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,699
Sorry?

589
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:28,410
If you really
cared about Nog

590
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,496
you'd never have sent him
out on that patrol.

591
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:32,914
Now you listen
to me, Quark

592
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,125
because I'm only going
to say this one time.

593
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,960
I care about Nog
and every solider

594
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,796
under my command,
understood?

595
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:41,173
Every single one.

596
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,063
Captain...

597
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,732
At ease, Ensign.

598
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:04,988
I'm sorry, sir.

599
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,824
About what?

600
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:08,950
About Larkin.

601
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,745
I led her right into a trap.

602
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:13,747
You found the Jem'Hadar camp.

603
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:19,169
I... I heard them coming,
but it was too late.

604
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:22,172
There was all this phaser fire

605
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:23,507
and I went down...

606
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:24,424
Nog...

607
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,551
...before
I could...

608
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:26,510
...listen to me.

609
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,720
You followed orders.

610
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,095
You did
what you were trained to do.

611
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,348
I'm proud of you.

612
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,351
Thank you, sir.

613
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,731
It doesn't hurt.

614
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,527
You'd think it would,
but it doesn't.

615
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,404
I'm glad.

616
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,490
I'm going to be fine.

617
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,370
Captain...

618
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:58,333
the communications array--
it's worth it, right?

619
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,294
I hope to God it is.

620
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,797
EZRI:
Benjamin, sorry
to interrupt.

621
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,382
We're ready.

622
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:42,252
Remember, no one moves
until I say so.

623
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:44,421
Go ahead, Lieutenant.

624
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:16,453
Now all we have to do

625
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:18,246
is figure out
how to disarm them.

626
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,500
We're not going
to disarm them.

627
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,836
We're going to use them.

628
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:26,129
This is their camp,
this is ours.

629
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,465
There are mountains
to the east and west

630
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:29,925
which means they have to come
through this ravine

631
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,176
to get to us.

632
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,427
Then that's
where we'll

633
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,137
relocate the mines.

634
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,221
KELLIN:
Moving them
shouldn't be

635
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,348
too difficult.

636
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:39,309
Delicate, but
not difficult.

637
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:41,603
I also want you
to reprogram them

638
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,522
so that they're triggered
by movement.

639
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,148
Make sure it's lots of movement.

640
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,399
We want that ravine
full of Jem'Hadar

641
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,527
when those Houdinis
start to go off.

642
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,153
I think we can manage that.

643
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,613
REESE:
That should
take out

644
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,198
a third of
their forces.

645
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,743
What's the matter, old man?

646
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,078
Don't you think
it'll work?

647
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:01,707
It's not that.

648
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:04,751
It's just that a few hours ago,
we thought of these mines

649
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,545
as the kind of
ruthless weapon

650
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:10,507
only the Dominion
would use, but now...

651
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:13,092
They become
a whole lot friendlier.

652
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,469
Sooner or later, the Jem'Hadar

653
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,221
are going to come
through those barricades

654
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,306
and when they do,
the fewer there are

655
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:21,226
the better our chances
of survival.

656
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,186
You have your orders.

657
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,623
Power packs.

658
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,752
Did you hear that?

659
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:48,754
I didn't hear anything.

660
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:52,925
Relax. When
they get here,
you'll know it.

661
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,679

I wonder

667

if the Jem'Hadar get jittery
before a battle.

00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,287
(<i> grunts</i> )

724
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:15,538
(<i> groans</i> )

725
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:27,759
(<i> sighs</i> )

726
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:33,348
You alive?

727
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,974
Captain...

728
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,935
are you with us?

729
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:44,901
I think so.

730
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,936
We held.

731
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:22,355
Those were our orders, sir.

732
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:38,537
Captain.

733
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,957
Yes, Mr. Worf.

734
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:43,542
The USS<i> Veracruz</i>
has entered orbit.

735
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,337
They're beaming down
troop replacements

736
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:46,754
and an engineering crew.

737
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,090
What about our people?

738
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,050
Dr. Bashir is aboard
the<i> Veracruz</i>

739
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,844
with Nog and the
rest of the wounded.

740
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,596
They will be taken to a
hospital on Starbase 371.

741
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,265
Good.

742
00:41:57,265 --> 00:42:00,101
I'll return
to the<i> Defiant</i> shortly.

743
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:06,941
This was a
great victory

744
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:10,987
one worthy of
story and song.

745
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:13,072
It cost enough.

746
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:26,585
This way.

747
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:29,047
You two, sector four.

748
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:32,925
Children.

749
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,220
Not for long.

750
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,430
Ready?

751
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:44,479
Let's go.

752
00:42:47,524 --> 00:42:49,608
Sisko to<i> Defiant.</i>

753
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:52,237
Three to beam up.

754
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:22,975
Sir, the latest casualty reports
have just been posted.

755
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,894
How many this time?

756
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:29,982
Including the troops lost
at AR-558-- 1,730.

757
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:33,069
Seventeen hundred thirty...

758
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:41,536
It's a lot of names.

759
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:44,080
They're not just names.

760
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:47,875
It's important
we remember that.

761
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:54,966
We have to remember.
