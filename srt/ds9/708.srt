1
00:00:02,196 --> 00:00:03,164
One, two, three, four, one.

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:06,170
She likes the free, fresh

3
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:08,537
Wind in her hair

4
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:10,705
Life without care

5
00:00:10,747 --> 00:00:12,979
She's broke, but it's oke

6
00:00:13,018 --> 00:00:14,988
Hates California

7
00:00:15,022 --> 00:00:17,653
It's cold and it's damp

8
00:00:17,694 --> 00:00:19,755
That's why the lady

9
00:00:19,798 --> 00:00:21,961
That's why
the lady

10
00:00:22,002 --> 00:00:25,703
That's why the lady

11
00:00:25,743 --> 00:00:27,211
Is a scamp.

12
00:00:28,348 --> 00:00:29,577
Ha...

13
00:00:31,387 --> 00:00:32,685
So, what do you think?

14
00:00:32,724 --> 00:00:33,714
Not bad.

15
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:35,695
But the lady is a "tramp"

16
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:36,720
not a scamp.

17
00:00:36,765 --> 00:00:37,755
Tramp, right.

18
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:40,033
So, do I get the..."gig"?

19
00:00:40,072 --> 00:00:41,905
Sorry, pally.

20
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:44,641
But Dr. Bashir said you're
looking for an opening act

21
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:46,172
and I love to sing.

22
00:00:46,217 --> 00:00:49,212
I can tell, but two singers
on the same bill...

23
00:00:49,256 --> 00:00:51,055
that's a one-way ticket
to Deadsville.

24
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:53,030
I need someone to warm
up the audience for me.

25
00:00:53,064 --> 00:00:54,259
You know, a comic.

26
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,563
A comic?

27
00:00:55,603 --> 00:00:56,571
A comedian.

28
00:00:56,605 --> 00:00:57,868
Someone who can make
people laugh.

29
00:00:57,907 --> 00:00:59,467
I can do that...
my brother tells me

30
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,036
people are always
laughing at me.

31
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,412
Well, that may be true

32
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:04,942
but this is a holosuite program,
<i>capisce?</i>

33
00:01:04,988 --> 00:01:06,149
So?

34
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,658
So, you're not a hologram.

35
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,631
Life can be so unfair.

36
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:11,895
Vic, you got a minute?

37
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:12,903
Forget it.

38
00:01:12,937 --> 00:01:13,962
He's not hiring.

39
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,168
What's wrong with him?

40
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,907
Show biz.
It can break your heart.

41
00:01:17,947 --> 00:01:19,610
So, what can I do for you,
pally?

42
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:20,812
Uh, did you get
a chance to make

43
00:01:20,853 --> 00:01:22,014
those audio recordings for me?

44
00:01:23,057 --> 00:01:24,423
All your favorite hits.

45
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,362
That's great.
Thanks, Vic.

46
00:01:26,397 --> 00:01:27,365
My pleasure.

47
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:28,925
These songs are 400 years old.

48
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:30,460
You sure the troops
on the front lines

49
00:01:30,505 --> 00:01:31,473
want to hear them?

50
00:01:31,507 --> 00:01:32,600
Well, the songs may be old

51
00:01:32,644 --> 00:01:34,637
but when you sing them,
they sound brand new.

52
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:35,944
Hey, when you put it that way

53
00:01:35,983 --> 00:01:38,112
I wish I was going
on the supply run with you.

54
00:01:38,154 --> 00:01:39,987
I could make some
personal appearances.

55
00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:41,790
Sing a few songs,
tell a few jokes.

56
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:44,197
You know, put on
a regular USO show.

57
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:45,793
I'm afraid
there are no holosuites

58
00:01:45,837 --> 00:01:47,807
where we're going.

59
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:48,809
Rom's right.

60
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:50,710
Life can be unfair.

61
00:01:50,746 --> 00:01:52,044
You know, pally

62
00:01:52,082 --> 00:01:54,245
sometimes being a hologram

63
00:01:54,286 --> 00:01:57,087
can be a real pain
in the asometric photons.

64
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:59,220
I'll see you when I get back.

65
00:01:59,263 --> 00:02:01,062
Well, you know where to find me.

66
00:02:13,726 --> 00:02:16,289
I thought I might find you here.

67
00:02:16,397 --> 00:02:19,858
The new security protocols
you requested.

68
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,398
I think that's what I'm going

69
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:25,141
to remember most
about this war...

70
00:02:25,181 --> 00:02:27,914
looking through
casualty reports.

71
00:02:27,954 --> 00:02:31,324
Sometimes it feels like
that's all I do...

72
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,830
stare at the names
of the dead.

73
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,240
When the war started,
I read every name.

74
00:02:41,347 --> 00:02:43,340
I felt it was the
least I could do

75
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:45,045
to honor their sacrifices.

76
00:02:48,862 --> 00:02:50,855
But now...

77
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,066
the names have begun
to blur together.

78
00:02:54,106 --> 00:02:56,599
Well, that's understandable.

79
00:02:57,847 --> 00:02:59,338
Maybe.

80
00:03:00,753 --> 00:03:02,689
Ops to Captain Sisko.

81
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:03,885
Go ahead.

82
00:03:03,926 --> 00:03:05,623
The <i>Defiant</i> is ready
for departure.

83
00:03:07,132 --> 00:03:08,191
On my way.

84
00:03:18,956 --> 00:03:20,892
Why me?

85
00:03:20,926 --> 00:03:23,864
Why did he have to send me?

86
00:03:23,899 --> 00:03:26,335
I'm like a son to him.

87
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,772
Quark, you're mumbling again.

88
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:29,777
I'm sorry.

89
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:30,870
It's...

90
00:03:30,913 --> 00:03:34,249
it's just not fair.

91
00:03:34,286 --> 00:03:36,188
I have responsibilities
of my own

92
00:03:36,223 --> 00:03:37,714
customers who depend on me.

93
00:03:39,831 --> 00:03:44,033
But the Grand Nagus picked you
for this assignment.

94
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:45,234
Some assignment...

95
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:49,306
a fact-finding mission
to the front lines.

96
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,883
Zek's already inundated with
Starfleet Intelligence reports.

97
00:03:53,926 --> 00:03:55,896
What could I tell him
that he doesn't know?

98
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,200
Maybe he wants to hear things
from a Ferengi perspective.

99
00:04:00,238 --> 00:04:02,208
Then let him ask Nog.

100
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,078
The Nagus trusts you.

101
00:04:08,387 --> 00:04:10,050
What are you trying to do?

102
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:11,890
Cheer me up?

103
00:04:11,928 --> 00:04:13,864
It's my job.

104
00:04:13,899 --> 00:04:16,735
Remember the 34th Rule
of Acquisition.

105
00:04:16,772 --> 00:04:18,138
"War is good for business."

106
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,905
Only from a distance.

107
00:04:19,944 --> 00:04:21,971
The closer you are
to the front lines

108
00:04:22,015 --> 00:04:24,612
the less profitable it gets.

109
00:04:27,692 --> 00:04:28,660
What is that?

110
00:04:28,694 --> 00:04:30,425
Stay here.

111
00:04:30,498 --> 00:04:32,991
Wait! Don't leave!

112
00:04:46,965 --> 00:04:49,596
This is no time
to be wandering the corridors.

113
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,135
I thought the Chin'toka System
was in Federation hands.

114
00:04:53,177 --> 00:04:54,406
It is, but the Dominion
is determined

115
00:04:54,446 --> 00:04:55,414
to take back their territory.

116
00:04:55,448 --> 00:04:56,575
The whole system's
a battleground.

117
00:04:57,619 --> 00:04:58,882
Thank you.

118
00:04:58,922 --> 00:05:01,392
I should probably
write this down.

119
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,978
Mr. O'Brien, keep an eye out
for more Jem'Hadar ships.

120
00:05:12,015 --> 00:05:13,415
Aye, sir.

121
00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:21,194
What are you doing here, Uncle?

122
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:23,601
I'm... visiting.

123
00:05:23,638 --> 00:05:25,072
I'm working.

124
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:26,634
Quark, is there something
we can do for you?

125
00:05:26,677 --> 00:05:27,975
Not really.

126
00:05:28,014 --> 00:05:30,850
I just came by to say
hello to my nephew.

127
00:05:30,886 --> 00:05:33,288
All right.
You've just said hello.

128
00:05:35,963 --> 00:05:37,489
Anybody here who would
like to join me

129
00:05:37,565 --> 00:05:38,794
in the mess hall
for a <i>raktajino?</i>

130
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:40,599
Quark.

131
00:05:40,638 --> 00:05:42,004
I'm just leaving.

132
00:05:48,187 --> 00:05:50,886
Sir, I assure you
that won't happen again.

133
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,797
Nog, your uncle's just
a little nervous.

134
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,173
He's not used to being
in a combat situation.

135
00:06:00,211 --> 00:06:01,908
That's no excuse.

136
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,707
Captain, the supplies
are ready for transport.

137
00:06:17,746 --> 00:06:20,182
AR-558 has acknowledged
your message.

138
00:06:20,218 --> 00:06:21,379
They are expecting you.

139
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,946
Away team, you're with me.

140
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,015
Mr. Worf, she's all yours.

141
00:06:24,059 --> 00:06:25,049
Aye, sir.

142
00:06:51,847 --> 00:06:54,410
Not much to look at, is it?

143
00:09:02,135 --> 00:09:04,902
Those are Federation phasers.

144
00:09:06,243 --> 00:09:07,872
Hold your fire!

145
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:12,080
I'm Captain Benjamin Sisko
of the USS <i>Defiant.</i>

146
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:13,248
You heard him!

147
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,485
Cease fire, damn it!

148
00:09:20,805 --> 00:09:22,137
We're coming out!

149
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,409
Who told you to open fire?

150
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,748
I saw movement.

151
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:46,516
I thought it was the Jem'Hadar.

152
00:09:46,556 --> 00:09:47,888
They look like Jem'Hadar to you?

153
00:09:47,926 --> 00:09:48,951
I gave the word

154
00:09:48,994 --> 00:09:51,089
to hold your fire;
that Starfleet Officers

155
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,762
were beaming down with supplies.

156
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:53,929
Well, nobody told me.

157
00:09:54,973 --> 00:09:56,100
Sorry, Captain...

158
00:09:56,143 --> 00:09:58,511
a little breakdown
in communications.

159
00:09:58,547 --> 00:09:59,674
No harm was done.

160
00:09:59,716 --> 00:10:01,310
Where's Captain Loomis?

161
00:10:01,353 --> 00:10:03,687
He was killed ten days ago.

162
00:10:03,724 --> 00:10:06,024
So was Commander Parker.

163
00:10:06,062 --> 00:10:07,691
Who's in command?

164
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,700
I am.

165
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:10,032
Lieutenant Nadia Larkin.

166
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,038
Ben Sisko.

167
00:10:11,072 --> 00:10:13,042
Where do you want
your supplies?

168
00:10:13,076 --> 00:10:15,205
Vargas can show you.

169
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,738
Supplies... that's great.

170
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,653
Don't they know we need
to get off this rock?

171
00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:20,987
Take it easy, Vargas.

172
00:10:21,025 --> 00:10:22,152
Take it easy?

173
00:10:22,195 --> 00:10:23,926
I would love to take it easy.

174
00:10:23,964 --> 00:10:25,193
Get me out of this vole hole

175
00:10:25,234 --> 00:10:27,067
and I promise you
for the rest of my life

176
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:28,572
all I'll do is
just take it easy.

177
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:30,839
According
to Starfleet regulations

178
00:10:30,878 --> 00:10:33,041
we're supposed to be rotated

179
00:10:33,082 --> 00:10:36,054
off the front lines
after 90 days. 90 days.

180
00:10:37,725 --> 00:10:38,852
We've been stuck

181
00:10:38,927 --> 00:10:41,956
on this rock
for five months, Captain.

182
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,833
Take it easy.

183
00:10:46,075 --> 00:10:48,011
Welcome to paradise, Captain.

184
00:10:52,455 --> 00:10:54,049
There it is...
the only reason

185
00:10:54,091 --> 00:10:56,186
anyone gives a damn
about this place.

186
00:10:56,229 --> 00:10:57,629
It's the largest Dominion

187
00:10:57,665 --> 00:10:59,658
communications array
in the sector.

188
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:01,433
If we can figure
out how it works

189
00:11:01,473 --> 00:11:04,138
we should be able to tap
into their entire com system.

190
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:05,477
One thing's for sure...

191
00:11:05,514 --> 00:11:07,005
they're determined
to get it back.

192
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,576
We can't let that happen.

193
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,180
I know our orders, Captain

194
00:11:10,224 --> 00:11:13,663
but maybe Starfleet Command
isn't aware of our situation.

195
00:11:13,697 --> 00:11:16,567
We've been holding this place
for five months...

196
00:11:16,603 --> 00:11:18,664
that's five months
of fighting off

197
00:11:18,707 --> 00:11:21,372
repeated Jem'Hadar
attempts to get it back.

198
00:11:21,413 --> 00:11:24,044
When we landed here,
there were 150 of us.

199
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:25,245
We're down to 43.

200
00:11:26,756 --> 00:11:28,623
I appreciate
what you've gone through

201
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,753
and I will make sure

202
00:11:29,796 --> 00:11:31,823
that Starfleet understands
your situation

203
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:33,130
but from what I hear

204
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:35,605
our forces are spread
pretty thin in this system.

205
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:37,736
Chances are,
you're going to be stuck here

206
00:11:37,778 --> 00:11:38,746
for a while longer.

207
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,112
Lucky us.

208
00:11:45,761 --> 00:11:47,958
Can someone hand me
a duonetic coupler?

209
00:11:53,477 --> 00:11:54,467
Thanks.

210
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:57,545
Your frequency
discriminator seems

211
00:11:57,585 --> 00:11:58,610
to be drifting.

212
00:11:58,654 --> 00:12:00,556
You might want to reset it.

213
00:12:00,591 --> 00:12:01,991
You an engineer?

214
00:12:02,027 --> 00:12:05,797
No... but Tobin,
one of my previous hosts, was.

215
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:06,802
Close enough.

216
00:12:06,836 --> 00:12:08,465
Pick up a microdyne coupler

217
00:12:08,507 --> 00:12:11,138
and start recalibrating
that transtator.

218
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,770
Nog, shouldn't you be

219
00:12:25,808 --> 00:12:28,244
helping Dr. Bashir
unload the supplies?

220
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,911
We're pretty much finished.

221
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:32,249
Good.

222
00:12:32,288 --> 00:12:34,781
The sooner we get
out of here, the better.

223
00:12:37,665 --> 00:12:40,660
That soldier over there,
you see his necklace?

224
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:44,401
Those are ketracel-white tubes.

225
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,644
So?

226
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:49,314
You know how he got them?

227
00:12:49,355 --> 00:12:50,823
Mail order?

228
00:12:50,858 --> 00:12:54,855
He took them off the bodies
of dead Jem'Hadar...

229
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,096
Jem'Hadar that he killed.

230
00:12:57,137 --> 00:12:59,300
It's his way of keeping score.

231
00:12:59,342 --> 00:13:01,437
And you find that impressive?

232
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:02,606
Isn't it?

233
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,139
I don't think so.

234
00:13:06,823 --> 00:13:09,351
Take a look around you, Nog.

235
00:13:09,395 --> 00:13:12,299
This isn't
the Starfleet you know.

236
00:13:12,335 --> 00:13:13,895
Sure it is.

237
00:13:13,937 --> 00:13:18,241
It's just that these people
have been through a lot.

238
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:21,649
They've been holed up here
a long time...

239
00:13:21,686 --> 00:13:24,122
seen two-thirds
of their unit killed

240
00:13:24,157 --> 00:13:26,354
but they haven't surrendered...

241
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:29,862
and do you know why?

242
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,678
Because they're heroes.

243
00:13:34,712 --> 00:13:36,511
Maybe, but I still
don't want you

244
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,608
anywhere near them.

245
00:13:42,895 --> 00:13:45,458
Let me tell you something
about hu-mans, Nephew.

246
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:50,034
They're a wonderful,
friendly people

247
00:13:50,109 --> 00:13:52,045
as long
as their bellies are full

248
00:13:52,113 --> 00:13:53,878
and their holosuites
are working...

249
00:13:56,756 --> 00:13:59,785
but take away
their creature comforts

250
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:07,004
deprive them of food,
sleep, sonic showers...

251
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:11,016
put their lives in jeopardy
over an extended period of time

252
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:16,426
and those same, friendly,
intelligent, wonderful people

253
00:14:16,463 --> 00:14:22,237
will become as nasty
and as violent

254
00:14:22,273 --> 00:14:25,040
as the most
bloodthirsty Klingon.

255
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:27,676
You don't believe me?

256
00:14:30,223 --> 00:14:31,714
Look at those faces.

257
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:34,754
Look in their eyes.

258
00:14:36,936 --> 00:14:39,406
You know I'm right, don't you?

259
00:14:41,746 --> 00:14:43,078
Well...

260
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,846
aren't you going
to say something?

261
00:14:48,025 --> 00:14:50,553
I feel sorry for the Jem'Hadar.

262
00:15:11,338 --> 00:15:14,606
This is 20cc's
of numinol tetraminothen.

263
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,650
That'll take care of the fever
and the chest congestion.

264
00:15:19,689 --> 00:15:23,288
This... will get rid
of the dermal irritation

265
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:24,958
on your back.

266
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:26,798
Better?

267
00:15:26,836 --> 00:15:29,204
Oh... are you kidding?

268
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,367
I haven't felt this good

269
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:32,106
since the day I landed
on this rock.

270
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,811
Good. Now, I'd like
to take a look at this arm.

271
00:15:36,689 --> 00:15:37,884
What the hell are you doing?

272
00:15:37,925 --> 00:15:39,690
You keep your hands
off this bandage.

273
00:15:40,931 --> 00:15:42,126
I need to treat your wound.

274
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,601
Nobody touches this bandage.

275
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,902
Is that understood?

276
00:15:45,941 --> 00:15:46,909
Why is that?

277
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,038
I asked you if you understood.

278
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,275
Yes.

279
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,728
McGreevey
put this bandage on me.

280
00:16:01,773 --> 00:16:04,540
He ripped up his own uniform
to make it.

281
00:16:04,578 --> 00:16:07,414
He sounds like a good friend.

282
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,315
He was a jerk.

283
00:16:08,352 --> 00:16:10,322
I couldn't stand the guy.

284
00:16:10,356 --> 00:16:11,916
He wouldn't shut up.

285
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:13,291
Yap, yap, yap.

286
00:16:13,328 --> 00:16:14,318
He thought he was

287
00:16:14,364 --> 00:16:16,664
the world's greatest authority
on everything.

288
00:16:19,174 --> 00:16:24,412
I know... he's dead,
and I should have more respect

289
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,887
but God, I hated him.

290
00:16:26,923 --> 00:16:29,622
One minute, he's tying
this bandage around my arm

291
00:16:29,662 --> 00:16:31,564
talking his head off

292
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:34,127
and the next minute,
he's lying flat on his back

293
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,661
with a hole in his chest...

294
00:16:39,347 --> 00:16:43,185
and I just sat there
and I looked at him.

295
00:16:43,255 --> 00:16:44,815
It was so great.

296
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,327
He was so quiet!

297
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:52,905
One time in his life,
he's quiet!

298
00:17:08,105 --> 00:17:10,541
I still need
to treat your wound.

299
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,763
I think you've set up
a solid defense perimeter

300
00:17:25,807 --> 00:17:27,970
but you need
to tighten this flank.

301
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:29,571
Captain, can I have a minute?

302
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,755
These people's physical
and mental health

303
00:17:35,794 --> 00:17:37,388
is precarious at best.

304
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,229
They need more than
a few food replicators

305
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,235
and medical supplies.

306
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:41,464
They need to be
shipped out of here.

307
00:17:41,504 --> 00:17:42,904
I understand that, but right now

308
00:17:42,941 --> 00:17:44,570
there's nothing I can do
about that.

309
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,077
Damn it!

310
00:17:59,007 --> 00:18:00,533
I saw it happen.

311
00:18:00,576 --> 00:18:01,635
He was walking along...

312
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,310
You must have swept the compound
for antipersonnel mines.

313
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,318
A hundred times.

314
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:07,151
It doesn't help,
not with Houdinis.

315
00:18:07,189 --> 00:18:08,680
Houdinis?

316
00:18:08,726 --> 00:18:10,696
Find one and you disappear.

317
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,566
They hide in subspace
and appear at random.

318
00:18:13,603 --> 00:18:15,835
You can walk by the same
place a hundred times

319
00:18:15,874 --> 00:18:18,071
and nothing happens,
and then, bang.

320
00:18:18,111 --> 00:18:20,343
You're wasting
your breath, Vargas.

321
00:18:20,382 --> 00:18:23,081
It's not the Captain's problem.

322
00:18:23,121 --> 00:18:24,920
He's leaving.

323
00:18:29,334 --> 00:18:30,427
I wish I could tell you

324
00:18:30,469 --> 00:18:32,371
things were going
to get easier for you.

325
00:18:32,406 --> 00:18:33,932
Don't worry about us,
Captain.

326
00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:36,209
<i>Defiant</i> to Captain Sisko.

327
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:37,613
Go ahead.

328
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:40,680
Sir, we're being attacked
by two Jem'Hadar ships.

329
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:42,056
We have locked
onto your coordinates.

330
00:18:42,093 --> 00:18:43,118
Are you ready for transport?

331
00:18:43,161 --> 00:18:44,629
Stand by, Mr. Worf.

332
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,193
Captain, sensors
show Jem'Hadar troops landing

333
00:18:47,236 --> 00:18:48,704
nine kilometers
from your position.

334
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,437
Sir, we must
beam you aboard now.

335
00:18:50,476 --> 00:18:51,444
We have to break orbit.

336
00:18:51,478 --> 00:18:53,778
Take evasive action, Mr. Worf.

337
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:55,945
We're staying here.

338
00:18:55,987 --> 00:18:58,321
Sir, I must ask you
to reconsider.

339
00:18:58,358 --> 00:19:00,268
I do not know when we will
be able to come back for you.

340
00:19:00,401 --> 00:19:02,428
You have your orders, Commander.

341
00:19:02,472 --> 00:19:03,872
Aye, sir.

342
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,503
Good luck.

343
00:19:10,689 --> 00:19:11,850
What are you looking at?

344
00:19:11,891 --> 00:19:12,859
We have work to do.

345
00:19:12,893 --> 00:19:14,954
Yes, sir.

346
00:19:14,997 --> 00:19:16,523
You heard the Captain.

347
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:18,537
Sir, what are your orders?

348
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:21,600
There's only one order,
Lieutenant.

349
00:19:24,116 --> 00:19:25,345
We hold.

350
00:19:47,595 --> 00:19:49,997
We need to find out how many
Jem'Hadar troops landed

351
00:19:50,034 --> 00:19:51,059
and where they are.

352
00:19:51,136 --> 00:19:52,468
Well, you're not going
to learn anything

353
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:53,632
with a tricorder.

354
00:19:53,674 --> 00:19:55,074
We jam their sensors,
they jam ours.

355
00:19:55,178 --> 00:19:56,510
That's how it works.

356
00:19:56,547 --> 00:19:58,312
Except they have an advantage...

357
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,579
they know where we are.

358
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:01,179
But that's all they know.

359
00:20:01,223 --> 00:20:03,056
They don't know
our defense position

360
00:20:03,093 --> 00:20:04,926
or how many of us there are.

361
00:20:04,964 --> 00:20:06,193
All things considered

362
00:20:06,233 --> 00:20:08,362
I'd still rather be
in their shoes.

363
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,101
Anything, Ensign?

364
00:20:13,147 --> 00:20:16,051
Plenty. I can hear Vargas'
stomach grumbling

365
00:20:16,086 --> 00:20:18,079
and Ezri tuning
a phase amplifier

366
00:20:18,123 --> 00:20:20,389
with a coil spanner
in the communications bunker.

367
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:22,057
What about the Jem'Hadar?

368
00:20:22,098 --> 00:20:23,624
Not a sound.

369
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:26,230
If they're out there,
they're being very quiet.

370
00:20:26,273 --> 00:20:27,536
They're out there.

371
00:20:31,818 --> 00:20:34,050
Keep your ears open, Ensign.

372
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:35,489
I will, sir.

373
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,729
See anything?

374
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:44,002
Uh-uh.

375
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,275
That knife you're working on...

376
00:20:47,315 --> 00:20:49,012
it's not Starfleet issue.

377
00:20:50,454 --> 00:20:51,980
Can I see it?

378
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:54,518
You're supposed to be listening
for the Jem'Hadar.

379
00:20:54,563 --> 00:20:56,192
I know.

380
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:57,964
Then shut up and listen.

381
00:20:59,105 --> 00:21:00,471
Here they come.

382
00:21:25,024 --> 00:21:26,550
There's something wrong.

383
00:21:28,364 --> 00:21:29,332
They're not firing.

384
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:32,866
Hold your fire!

385
00:21:35,778 --> 00:21:37,212
Wh-where'd they go?

386
00:21:37,281 --> 00:21:39,649
They weren't here to begin with.

387
00:21:39,686 --> 00:21:41,086
Holograms.

388
00:21:41,123 --> 00:21:42,683
I don't understand.

389
00:21:42,725 --> 00:21:45,059
It was a way for them to see
what they were up against

390
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:46,862
determine our numbers.

391
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:49,235
And pinpoint our positions.

392
00:21:49,305 --> 00:21:52,607
Without risking
any casualties... smart.

393
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,444
Oh, yeah.
They're smart, all right

394
00:21:54,482 --> 00:21:55,848
and we're as good as dead!

395
00:21:55,886 --> 00:21:57,947
Not yet we aren't.

396
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,958
Is it over?!

397
00:21:58,992 --> 00:21:59,960
For now.

398
00:21:59,994 --> 00:22:01,121
But the next time

399
00:22:01,163 --> 00:22:03,429
they won't send holograms.

400
00:22:09,847 --> 00:22:11,315
Get that stretcher.

401
00:22:11,349 --> 00:22:12,578
Let's get him to the Infirmary.

402
00:22:15,257 --> 00:22:16,783
Does that mean we stop

403
00:22:16,827 --> 00:22:18,592
working on
the communications array?

404
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,964
They'll have to get along
without you for a while.

405
00:22:21,002 --> 00:22:23,495
We have to find the Houdinis
and disarm them.

406
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,803
I'm all for that.

407
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,211
These mines are a nasty piece
of engineering.

408
00:22:27,248 --> 00:22:29,343
They're also impossible
to detect.

409
00:22:29,385 --> 00:22:30,580
I'm sorry, Captain

410
00:22:30,621 --> 00:22:33,023
but I'm an engineer,
not a magician.

411
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,257
Larkin says
you like a challenge.

412
00:22:35,364 --> 00:22:38,268
I thought I did,
but after banging my head

413
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,602
against that
communications array

414
00:22:40,641 --> 00:22:44,045
for the last few months,
I'm not so sure anymore.

415
00:22:44,082 --> 00:22:46,575
He's just being modest, Captain.

416
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,387
Chief O'Brien would be proud
to have him on his crew.

417
00:22:50,594 --> 00:22:52,496
I can't think of higher praise.

418
00:22:56,072 --> 00:22:57,701
Now what?

419
00:22:57,742 --> 00:23:01,010
Now we get to pull a rabbit
out of our hat.

420
00:23:08,163 --> 00:23:09,392
Here.

421
00:23:09,432 --> 00:23:12,063
You need to keep
your strength up.

422
00:23:12,104 --> 00:23:15,235
Thanks, Uncle, but I
can get my own food.

423
00:23:16,413 --> 00:23:17,847
What's the matter?

424
00:23:17,882 --> 00:23:21,048
Afraid of looking weak
in front of the hu-mans?

425
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:24,118
I want to earn their respect
if that's what you mean.

426
00:23:24,162 --> 00:23:26,690
At the price of your soul?

427
00:23:29,906 --> 00:23:33,106
Look at you...
you hold that phaser rifle

428
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:34,809
as if it were made
of pure latinum.

429
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:36,819
We're in the middle of a war

430
00:23:36,853 --> 00:23:38,880
and this rifle
can keep me alive.

431
00:23:38,925 --> 00:23:41,054
I'm a Starfleet Officer.

432
00:23:41,096 --> 00:23:42,530
You're a Ferengi

433
00:23:42,565 --> 00:23:44,831
and I wish
you'd start acting like one.

434
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:47,705
You mean, hiding under a rock
every time trouble starts?

435
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:53,182
I'll tell you one thing,
Nephew...

436
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,454
if the Federation had listened
to the Ferengi Alliance

437
00:23:56,493 --> 00:23:59,124
there never would have been
a war.

438
00:23:59,165 --> 00:24:02,160
Because we would have
surrendered a long time ago.

439
00:24:02,204 --> 00:24:05,665
No. We would have reached
an accommodation.

440
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:08,615
We would have sat down
across a negotiation table

441
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:11,349
and hammered out
a peace treaty.

442
00:24:13,293 --> 00:24:15,525
One that both sides
could live with.

443
00:24:15,564 --> 00:24:17,625
You make it sound so simple.

444
00:24:17,668 --> 00:24:19,831
Rule of Acquisition 125:

445
00:24:19,872 --> 00:24:22,240
"You can't make a deal
if you're dead."

446
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:24,271
Nog.

447
00:24:24,315 --> 00:24:25,875
I'm sending you,
Larkin and Reese

448
00:24:25,918 --> 00:24:27,181
out on a scouting patrol.

449
00:24:27,221 --> 00:24:28,189
Yes, sir.

450
00:24:28,223 --> 00:24:30,193
I need to know
what I'm up against...

451
00:24:30,227 --> 00:24:31,992
how many Jem'Hadar are out there

452
00:24:32,031 --> 00:24:33,021
where they're camped

453
00:24:33,066 --> 00:24:34,534
and what kind of weapons
they have with them.

454
00:24:34,569 --> 00:24:35,537
When do we leave?

455
00:24:35,571 --> 00:24:36,561
Right away.

456
00:24:36,606 --> 00:24:37,972
Hold on a minute!

457
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,982
Why Nog, when you have

458
00:24:41,016 --> 00:24:42,382
all these veterans
to choose from?

459
00:24:42,451 --> 00:24:43,942
No one asked your opinion.

460
00:24:43,988 --> 00:24:46,390
Our tricorders aren't working.

461
00:24:46,426 --> 00:24:47,587
But my hearing is.

462
00:24:47,628 --> 00:24:48,926
Exactly.

463
00:24:48,964 --> 00:24:50,193
You can count on me, sir.

464
00:24:50,234 --> 00:24:51,259
I'll find the Jem'Hadar.

465
00:24:51,302 --> 00:24:52,270
Let's go.

466
00:24:52,304 --> 00:24:54,399
Nog, wait a minute...

467
00:24:54,509 --> 00:24:56,172
He has his orders, Quark.

468
00:25:00,354 --> 00:25:02,985
That is so easy for you to say.

469
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:07,798
But I bet you wouldn't
send Jake out there.

470
00:25:07,835 --> 00:25:10,534
Jake is not a Starfleet Officer.

471
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:48,849
You did it.

472
00:25:50,521 --> 00:25:53,084
Actually, I'm not sure
it was me.

473
00:25:53,126 --> 00:25:54,925
It could have been
Tobin or Jadzia.

474
00:25:54,962 --> 00:25:56,260
It doesn't matter.

475
00:25:56,299 --> 00:25:57,426
The point is, you managed

476
00:25:57,468 --> 00:25:59,028
to cut through
the jamming signals.

477
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:03,311
Unfortunately,
I can't extend its range

478
00:26:03,346 --> 00:26:04,780
past a hundred meters.

479
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:07,412
That's enough to scan
the entire compound.

480
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,826
Now the question is:

481
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,295
How do we calibrate
the tricorder

482
00:26:12,331 --> 00:26:15,201
to locate the mines in subspace?

483
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:21,106
Maybe we could try cross-linking
the optronic and isodyne relays.

484
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,653
You're sure
you're not an engineer?

485
00:26:25,691 --> 00:26:27,820
In nine lives, I've been
a little of everything.

486
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:32,737
Doesn't that...
doesn't that get confusing?

487
00:26:32,771 --> 00:26:34,331
You have no idea.

488
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:36,072
Really.

489
00:26:36,112 --> 00:26:38,480
I'll give you an example.

490
00:26:38,583 --> 00:26:41,749
This is my first time
on the front lines.

491
00:26:41,789 --> 00:26:43,691
You're talking about Ezri now?

492
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,218
Right.

493
00:26:45,264 --> 00:26:50,902
But Torias, Curzon and Jadzia,
they were in battle many times

494
00:26:50,941 --> 00:26:54,472
and I can remember
what that felt like.

495
00:26:54,515 --> 00:26:58,979
I remember the fear
and the anger

496
00:26:59,024 --> 00:27:01,119
and the adrenaline surge.

497
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:04,863
Having someone else's memories
of being in combat is one thing.

498
00:27:06,906 --> 00:27:08,397
Living through it yourself...

499
00:27:08,443 --> 00:27:10,572
is another.

500
00:27:10,614 --> 00:27:13,107
I suppose I'm going to find out.

501
00:27:15,624 --> 00:27:17,058
You'll do fine.

502
00:27:41,642 --> 00:27:43,042
This is close enough, Nog.

503
00:27:48,656 --> 00:27:51,024
What is it?
What's going on?

504
00:27:51,061 --> 00:27:52,758
It's time to go.

505
00:28:02,284 --> 00:28:03,844
Right.

506
00:28:03,887 --> 00:28:05,447
Let's go.

507
00:28:16,412 --> 00:28:17,402
Psst!

508
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,444
Someone's coming!

509
00:28:51,482 --> 00:28:53,281
Don't shoot!
It's me... Reese!

510
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:54,514
Stretcher!

511
00:28:54,555 --> 00:28:55,648
Nog!

512
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:58,218
What happened?!

513
00:28:58,263 --> 00:28:59,424
Jem'Hadar patrol.

514
00:28:59,465 --> 00:29:00,524
Larkin?

515
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:01,728
She's dead.

516
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:02,828
Damn!

517
00:29:02,871 --> 00:29:04,898
The Ferengi found
the encampment.

518
00:29:04,942 --> 00:29:06,462
It's three kilometers
south of here.

519
00:29:06,595 --> 00:29:08,360
- How many troops?
- Two columns.

520
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,927
How we ever going
to hold off two columns?

521
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,370
We'll have to even out the odds.

522
00:29:12,407 --> 00:29:13,636
Any ideas?

523
00:29:13,676 --> 00:29:14,769
I'm working on it.

524
00:29:14,811 --> 00:29:16,337
Captain...

525
00:29:17,384 --> 00:29:18,852
...the kid did all right.

526
00:29:24,698 --> 00:29:27,397
The doctor doesn't want
anybody in there.

527
00:29:27,437 --> 00:29:29,066
Well, how's Nog?

528
00:29:29,106 --> 00:29:32,101
It's a little late for you
to care about that, isn't it?

529
00:29:32,212 --> 00:29:33,077
Quark...

530
00:29:33,114 --> 00:29:35,516
He's going to lose his leg.

531
00:29:35,553 --> 00:29:37,216
Does that answer your question?

532
00:29:44,103 --> 00:29:45,230
Now what happens?

533
00:29:45,272 --> 00:29:46,365
You will be able

534
00:29:46,408 --> 00:29:47,876
to replace the leg, won't you?

535
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,710
As soon as we can get him
to a hospital

536
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:52,150
he can be fitted
with a biosynthetic limb.

537
00:29:52,186 --> 00:29:55,990
Unfortunately, there,
uh... may be complications.

538
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:56,995
What's that supposed to mean?

539
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:58,327
Nog suffered

540
00:29:58,366 --> 00:30:01,167
severe thermal damage
to his femoral motor nerves,

541
00:30:01,237 --> 00:30:02,637
and I'm not sure they'll be able

542
00:30:02,674 --> 00:30:04,405
to stimulate
artificial muscle tissue.

543
00:30:04,444 --> 00:30:05,742
In fact, there's
no way of knowing

544
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,511
until after the operation
has been performed.

545
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,081
I have to get inside.

546
00:30:16,368 --> 00:30:18,304
We've got to get Nog
to a hospital.

547
00:30:18,339 --> 00:30:19,500
We will as soon as we can.

548
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:20,770
That's not good enough.

549
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:22,210
I'm sorry.

550
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:24,545
Sorry?

551
00:30:24,584 --> 00:30:27,215
If you really cared about Nog

552
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:29,418
you'd never have sent him
out on that patrol.

553
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:31,658
Now you listen to me, Quark

554
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:34,067
because I'm only going
to say this one time.

555
00:30:34,103 --> 00:30:35,697
I care about Nog
and every solider

556
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,835
under my command, understood?

557
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:39,904
Every single one.

558
00:30:54,444 --> 00:30:55,912
Captain...

559
00:30:55,947 --> 00:30:57,678
At ease, Ensign.

560
00:31:02,226 --> 00:31:03,820
I'm sorry, sir.

561
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:05,662
About what?

562
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,795
About Larkin.

563
00:31:07,837 --> 00:31:10,673
I led her right into a trap.

564
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,771
You found the Jem'Hadar camp.

565
00:31:12,814 --> 00:31:18,257
I... I heard them coming,
but it was too late.

566
00:31:18,358 --> 00:31:21,262
There was all this phaser fire

567
00:31:21,364 --> 00:31:22,423
and I went down...

568
00:31:22,467 --> 00:31:23,435
Nog...

569
00:31:23,469 --> 00:31:24,437
...before I could...

570
00:31:24,471 --> 00:31:25,439
...listen to me.

571
00:31:25,473 --> 00:31:26,441
You followed orders.

572
00:31:26,475 --> 00:31:28,240
You did
what you were trained to do.

573
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:30,077
I'm proud of you.

574
00:31:32,152 --> 00:31:33,586
Thank you, sir.

575
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:37,663
It doesn't hurt.

576
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,397
You'd think it would,
but it doesn't.

577
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,137
I'm glad.

578
00:31:45,345 --> 00:31:47,440
I'm going to be fine.

579
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,321
Captain...

580
00:31:52,392 --> 00:31:57,232
the communications array...
it's worth it, right?

581
00:31:57,269 --> 00:32:00,139
I hope to God it is.

582
00:32:00,175 --> 00:32:02,645
Benjamin, sorry to interrupt.

583
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,343
We're ready.

584
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:41,148
Remember, no one moves
until I say so.

585
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,422
Go ahead, Lieutenant.

586
00:33:13,922 --> 00:33:15,448
Now all we have to do

587
00:33:15,492 --> 00:33:17,325
is figure out
how to disarm them.

588
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:20,459
We're not going to disarm them.

589
00:33:20,503 --> 00:33:22,939
We're going to use them.

590
00:33:22,974 --> 00:33:25,035
This is their camp,
this is ours.

591
00:33:25,078 --> 00:33:27,571
There are mountains
to the east and west

592
00:33:27,617 --> 00:33:29,280
which means they have to come
through this ravine

593
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:30,309
to get to us.

594
00:33:30,355 --> 00:33:32,986
Then that's where we'll
relocate the mines.

595
00:33:33,027 --> 00:33:35,395
Moving them shouldn't be
too difficult.

596
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:38,370
Delicate, but not difficult.

597
00:33:38,404 --> 00:33:40,704
I also want you
to reprogram them

598
00:33:40,743 --> 00:33:42,508
so that they're triggered
by movement.

599
00:33:42,547 --> 00:33:44,015
Make sure it's lots of movement.

600
00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:45,415
We want that ravine
full of Jem'Hadar

601
00:33:45,518 --> 00:33:47,545
when those Houdinis
start to go off.

602
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,355
I think we can manage that.

603
00:33:49,393 --> 00:33:52,126
That should take out
a third of their forces.

604
00:33:54,804 --> 00:33:55,863
What's the matter, old man?

605
00:33:55,906 --> 00:33:58,103
Don't you think it'll work?

606
00:33:58,144 --> 00:34:00,546
It's not that.

607
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:03,817
It's just that a few hours ago,
we thought of these mines

608
00:34:03,856 --> 00:34:05,655
as the kind of ruthless weapon

609
00:34:05,693 --> 00:34:09,599
only the Dominion
would use, but now...

610
00:34:09,634 --> 00:34:12,162
They become
a whole lot friendlier.

611
00:34:12,205 --> 00:34:13,400
Sooner or later, the Jem'Hadar

612
00:34:13,474 --> 00:34:15,171
are going to come
through those barricades

613
00:34:15,211 --> 00:34:17,408
and when they do,
the fewer there are

614
00:34:17,482 --> 00:34:20,283
the better our chances
of survival.

615
00:34:20,321 --> 00:34:22,120
You have your orders.

616
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:42,797
Power packs.

617
00:34:44,303 --> 00:34:45,794
Did you hear that?

618
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,968
I didn't hear anything.

619
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:52,075
Relax. When they get here,
you'll know it.

620
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:56,854
Power packs.

621
00:35:25,653 --> 00:35:27,213
I'm sorry.

622
00:35:27,255 --> 00:35:30,922
My, uh, thumb
got a little nervous.

623
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:33,263
I know how you feel.

624
00:35:33,301 --> 00:35:35,100
I wonder

625
00:35:35,138 --> 00:35:37,074
if the Jem'Hadar get jittery
before a battle.

626
00:35:37,108 --> 00:35:38,839
I wouldn't count on it.

627
00:35:40,348 --> 00:35:43,718
In that small...

628
00:35:43,755 --> 00:35:45,748
What the hell is that?

629
00:35:45,793 --> 00:35:48,195
Shh, listen.

630
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,698
...park across the way

631
00:35:49,734 --> 00:35:54,767
The children's carousel

632
00:35:54,811 --> 00:35:57,874
The chestnut trees

633
00:35:57,917 --> 00:36:00,787
The wishing well

634
00:36:00,823 --> 00:36:05,993
I'll be seeing you

635
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:10,337
In every lovely summer's day

636
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:14,679
In everything
that's bright and gay

637
00:36:14,717 --> 00:36:19,819
I'll always
think of you that way...

638
00:36:19,861 --> 00:36:21,056
Your idea?

639
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,189
Yeah, I thought we could all use

640
00:36:22,232 --> 00:36:24,134
a little Vic Fontaine
right about now.

641
00:36:24,169 --> 00:36:25,637
How's Nog?

642
00:36:25,671 --> 00:36:26,798
There isn't much
I can do for him

643
00:36:26,841 --> 00:36:28,070
until I get him back
to the station.

644
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,546
I take it you were able
to move the mines.

645
00:36:30,615 --> 00:36:32,049
Put it this way, I wouldn't go

646
00:36:32,085 --> 00:36:33,816
for a stroll
through that ravine tonight.

647
00:36:33,855 --> 00:36:35,688
I wasn't planning on it

648
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:39,996
but then again,
I wasn't planning on being here.

649
00:36:43,174 --> 00:36:45,873
I can see
you've done that before.

650
00:36:45,913 --> 00:36:47,815
Too many times.

651
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:51,915
Funny... I joined Starfleet
to save lives.

652
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:55,397
...when the night is new...

653
00:36:57,535 --> 00:36:59,562
I'll be looking at the moon

654
00:37:02,145 --> 00:37:08,921
But I'll be seeing you.

655
00:37:23,822 --> 00:37:25,985
Maybe they're not coming.

656
00:37:26,026 --> 00:37:28,360
Maybe they're turning back.

657
00:37:28,397 --> 00:37:30,663
Maybe we got them all.

658
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:49,368
Fire!

659
00:39:46,825 --> 00:39:49,057
Kellin?

660
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,066
Kellin?!

661
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:31,142
You alive?

662
00:40:31,247 --> 00:40:33,012
Captain...

663
00:40:33,051 --> 00:40:35,078
are you with us?

664
00:40:40,399 --> 00:40:42,869
I think so.

665
00:41:15,769 --> 00:41:18,001
We held.

666
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:20,534
Those were our orders, sir.

667
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,610
Captain.

668
00:41:36,644 --> 00:41:38,807
Yes, Mr. Worf.

669
00:41:38,849 --> 00:41:41,480
The USS <i>Veracruz</i>
has entered orbit.

670
00:41:41,521 --> 00:41:43,218
They're beaming down
troop replacements

671
00:41:43,258 --> 00:41:44,749
and an engineering crew.

672
00:41:45,762 --> 00:41:47,060
What about our people?

673
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:49,001
Dr. Bashir is aboard
the <i>Veracruz</i>

674
00:41:49,036 --> 00:41:50,665
with Nog and the
rest of the wounded.

675
00:41:50,706 --> 00:41:53,701
They will be taken to a hospital
on Starbase 371.

676
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:55,339
Good.

677
00:41:55,382 --> 00:41:57,910
I'll return
to the <i>Defiant</i> shortly.

678
00:42:02,696 --> 00:42:05,532
This was a great victory

679
00:42:05,569 --> 00:42:08,905
one worthy of story and song.

680
00:42:08,942 --> 00:42:11,105
It cost enough.

681
00:42:23,705 --> 00:42:24,764
This way.

682
00:42:24,807 --> 00:42:26,868
You two, sector four.

683
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,915
Children.

684
00:42:30,953 --> 00:42:33,185
Not for long.

685
00:42:33,224 --> 00:42:35,490
Ready?

686
00:42:40,439 --> 00:42:42,534
Let's go.

687
00:42:45,582 --> 00:42:47,814
Sisko to <i>Defiant.</i>

688
00:42:47,853 --> 00:42:50,289
Three to beam up.

689
00:43:16,778 --> 00:43:21,185
Sir, the latest casualty reports
have just been posted.

690
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,190
How many this time?

691
00:43:23,224 --> 00:43:28,132
Including the troops lost
at AR-558... 1,730.

692
00:43:28,168 --> 00:43:31,334
Seventeen hundred thirty...

693
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:39,712
It's a lot of names.

694
00:43:39,757 --> 00:43:42,354
They're not just names.

695
00:43:43,698 --> 00:43:45,964
It's important we remember that.

696
00:43:51,781 --> 00:43:53,272
We have to remember.
