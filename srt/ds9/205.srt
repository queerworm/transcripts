1
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,223
Ah.

2
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:17,017
Tarkalean tea
again, Doctor?

3
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,102
Yes, and you're drinking
Rokassa juice

4
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,020
aren't you, Garak?

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,313
How did
you know?

6
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:22,815
The odor is unmistakable.

7
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:23,858
(<i> chuckling</i> )

8
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:25,567
So it is.

9
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:29,363
Rokassa juice
soothes my nerves.

10
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,616
I had a very demanding
customer today--

11
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:36,745
a Bajoran engineer who comes
to the shop constantly

12
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,121
just to plague me.

13
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,540
You know, I've always
wondered about that--

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,208
about who your steady
customers really are.

15
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,210
I can't imagine Bajorans
frequenting a shop

16
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,419
run by a Cardassian.

17
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,797
I like to think
that my expertise

18
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,674
and willingness to serve

19
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,759
overcome any
general resentment

20
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,012
any of my clientele
may have.

21
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:55,138
Ah... and perhaps
your expertise

22
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,849
and willingness to serve

23
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:59,685
go so far as to establish
a certain... trust

24
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,520
between you
and your customers?

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,104
Trust is
very important.

26
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,940
And once they trust you

27
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,776
they're much
more open with you

28
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,862
and they tell you things.

29
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:14,033
Really, Doctor, must we
always play this game?

30
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:17,244
I'm no more a spy
than you are...

31
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,453
A doctor.

32
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,955
I'm afraid

33
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:22,290
you really do allow
your imagination

34
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,751
to run away with you.

35
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:26,294
What else can I say
to finally convince you

36
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,922
that I'm just...

37
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:30,049
Plain, simple Garak?

38
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:31,132
Precisely.

39
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,843
(<i> chuckling</i> )

40
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:35,721
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

41
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,603
There's a table.

42
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,814
Have a seat.

43
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,316
I'll get us all
some refreshment.

44
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,245
Well, that was odd.

45
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,413
Do you
know him?

46
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:02,706
On the contrary.

47
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:06,585
I've never seen him before
in my life.

48
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,712
I hope I'm
not intruding

49
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:11,381
but I couldn't help
noticing what a...

50
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,217
what a handsome young man
you have here.

51
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,265
(<i> screaming</i> )

52
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,687
I'm sorry I'm late.

53
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,313
The damnedest thing
just happened.

54
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,314
Garak the tailor
was attacked.

55
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,234
Attacked
where?

56
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:36,443
At the Replimat.

57
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,652
He was bitten on the hand.

58
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,613
Another unsatisfied
customer?

59
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,823
He always cuts
the pants too long.

60
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,075
BASHIR:
Actually, it was a boy--

61
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:44,952
a Cardassian boy.

62
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,286
I wasn't aware we had

63
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,913
any Cardassian children
on the station.

64
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,748
We don't.

65
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,499
He's just arrived
on a Bajoran transport

66
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,794
with an adult Bajoran
who says he's his father.

67
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,712
KIRA:
The boy
was probably

68
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,048
one of the orphans left behind
when the Cardassians pulled out.

69
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,591
We had no choice
but to take care of them.

70
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,469
You have an incoming
subspace transmission

71
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,179
from Cardassia, Commander.

72
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,014
It's Gul Dukat.

73
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,557
In my office.

74
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,025
<i>Commander, it's been brought</i>
<i>to my attention</i>

75
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,611
<i>that the sole Cardassian</i>
<i>living on your station</i>

76
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,280
<i>has been assaulted.</i>

77
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,741
I'm surprised how quickly
the news reached you, Dukat.

78
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,576
I only heard about it myself
a minute ago.

79
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,495
<i>Well, is it true</i>
<i>he was attacked</i>

80
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,999
<i>by a Cardassian boy brought</i>
<i>to the station by a Bajoran?</i>

81
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,626
A Cardassian boy appears
to be involved, yes.

82
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,046
<i>Exactly as I feared.</i>

83
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:41,049
<i>Exactly as I've been</i>
<i>warning my colleagues.</i>

84
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,551
Warning them?

85
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,054
<i>Cardassian war orphans,</i>
<i>Commander.</i>

86
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,473
<i>Abandoned when we left Bajor.</i>

87
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,184
<i>It's a disgrace,</i>

88
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:53,020
<i>and obviously, these</i>
<i>children are being raised</i>

89
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,479
<i>to hate their own kind.</i>

90
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,106
<i>This incident is proof.</i>

91
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,650
You're assuming a lot
from one incident.

92
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,194
<i>Am I?</i>

93
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:03,738
<i>Then why would this boy</i>
<i>attack poor Garak?</i>

94
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,200
<i>An amiable fellow,</i>
<i>if ever there was one.</i>

95
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,743
If you'd like,
I'll try to find out.

96
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,871
<i>That would be most</i>
<i>appreciated, Commander.</i>

97
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:14,624
<i>I need to find out everything</i>
<i>I can about this boy</i>

98
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:19,046
<i>so that I can use his story in</i>
<i>my fight to bring these orphans</i>

99
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,379
<i>back to their homeland.</i>

100
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,007
<i>This is a tragedy</i>

101
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:25,635
<i>that all of Cardassia is</i>
<i>going to have to address.</i>

102
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,389
We didn't come here
to cause trouble.

103
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,267
Has this Garak
filed a complaint?

104
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,019
No, but the Cardassian officials

105
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,021
asked that we look
into the incident.

106
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,731
I wish they'd shown
as much concern

107
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,275
as when they left my boy
and dozens like him

108
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,568
to fend for themselves.

109
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,028
How did you come
to adopt him?

110
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,404
My wife and I felt that Rugal
shouldn't suffer

111
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:46,781
for crimes committed by others.

112
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,700
But why would he attack
another Cardassian?

113
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,619
That Cardassian should have
minded his own business.

114
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,496
Garak was only trying
to be friendly.

115
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:56,041
The boy seemed terrified
of him on sight.

116
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,459
The Cardassians are suggesting
that the Bajorans

117
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,921
are raising these orphans
to hate their own people.

118
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,048
To hate Cardassians?

119
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:06,718
It shouldn't be
too hard, should it?

120
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,512
We told him the truth,
Commander.

121
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,765
The truth

122
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,559
about what Cardassia
did to Bajor.

123
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,103
He needed to know.

124
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,772
And for that,
I make no apologies.

125
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:26,487
To us... he isn't even
one of them anymore.

126
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:29,866
He isn't Cardassian.

127
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,785
He's Bajoran.

128
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,711
And we love him

129
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:45,173
just as if he was
our own flesh and blood.

130
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,974
All right, here we go.

131
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,267
Here we go.

132
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:58,103
Come on now, baby, come on.

133
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,775
Dabo!

134
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,526
(<i> laughing</i> )

135
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,953
There's nothing quite so
depressing as a winning streak

136
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,663
that won't stop streaking.

137
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:17,789
Dabo!

138
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,082
Oh...

139
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:25,922
It would appear as if

140
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,632
you have this game
all figured out.

141
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,260
Dabo!

142
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,804
Dabo is a passion of mine.

143
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,016
I remember you.
You're Doctor...

144
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,058
Bashir.

145
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:37,976
Bashir, yes.

146
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,227
How's the
Cardassian?

147
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,603
Still has all his
fingers, I presume.

148
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,147
Yes... luckily there
were no broken bones.

149
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,648
I've never seen a boy

150
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,150
take a bite out of
a man's hand like that.

151
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,485
He's a strange
boy, Rugal.

152
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,153
Do you know
the family well?

153
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,364
Dabo!
Do you?

154
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,949
Look, this is really
none of my business.

155
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,659
Well, you were a witness.

156
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,662
I just want to get my facts
right for the medical report.

157
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:01,082
I'd really rather
you asked someone else.

158
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,293
Frankly, I don't
understand your attitude.

159
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,045
All I asked
was if you know them well.

160
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,629
Well enough.

161
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:12,052
I heard the father was
looking for a new job

162
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,762
several months ago,
and I offered to help.

163
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,724
I visited them on Bajor
several times.

164
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,060
Did you find
anything troubling?

165
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,396
It must be torture
for that boy

166
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,855
living like that.

167
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:27,484
Hated by people he thinks
of as his parents.

168
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:31,488
Told day after day, he's
worthless Cardassian scum.

169
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,199
Beaten if he even
looks the wrong way.

170
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,451
Rugal is their revenge--

171
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,954
their revenge against
all Cardassians.

172
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,546
It is not true.

173
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:48,755
It is not true!

174
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,298
Rugal will tell you.

175
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,259
We have not
mistreated him.

176
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,927
Is this some
Cardassian...

177
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,803
There will be
ample opportunity

178
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,889
to go over the matter in detail

179
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:01,017
but during the investigation,
we'd like for Rugal

180
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,853
to stay with our schoolteacher,
Mrs. O'Brien.

181
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,855
She's expecting him now.

182
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,067
What if I refuse?

183
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,319
Then I'll have
to call security

184
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,448
and have them remove him
from your quarters.

185
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,950
I don't think either
of us wants that.

186
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,336
RUGAL:
Why?

187
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,046
FATHER:
It will be
all right.

188
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,466
RUGAL:
I didn't do
anything wrong!

189
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,759
FATHER:
I know, I know.

190
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,844
It will be all right.

191
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,061
I didn't do
anything wrong.

192
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,397
Nobody's accusing you
of a crime, Rugal.

193
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,065
You're not
being arrested.

194
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,610
My name is
Commander Sisko.

195
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,237
I believe you already
know Dr. Bashir.

196
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,530
Hello, Rugal.

197
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,864
SISKO:
I'm sure all of this

198
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,992
will be straightened out
in a day or two.

199
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,329
If you want to visit with
your father tomorrow, you can.

200
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,080
Go on, Rugal.

201
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,583
We'll talk tomorrow.

202
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,464
They won't hurt you.

203
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,549
They're humans.

204
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,926
They're not Cardassians.

205
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,455
Actually, something good did
come out of all of this, Garak.

206
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,374
Oh?
If it hadn't happened,

207
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,083
we'd never have discovered
Rugal's situation.

208
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,709
And a bite on the
hand is certainly

209
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,462
worth saving a boy's
life, wouldn't you say?

210
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,922
I suppose it depends
on whose hand.

211
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,966
Just joking, Doctor.

212
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,843
Perhaps it might
even help Gul Dukat

213
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,220
in his efforts
to resolve

214
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,180
the entire war
orphan predicament.

215
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,722
I beg your pardon?

216
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,268
Gul Dukat.

217
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,688
He called Commander Sisko
right after this happened.

218
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:13,066
Apparently, he was quite
concerned with your well-being.

219
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,401
You never mentioned

220
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,443
you were friends.

221
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,071
(<i> laughing</i> )

222
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:22,283
You said Dukat is doing
something about war orphans?

223
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,118
He wants to bring them
all home from Bajor.

224
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,454
Does he?

225
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,457
Am I missing something?

226
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,834
Tell me,
Doctor...

227
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,753
is there a single trait
you would ascribe

228
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:37,131
to me and my fellow Cardassians?

229
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:42,095
Would it not be
our attention to detail?

230
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:46,391
Do you think we simply forgot

231
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,893
about those poor little orphans
when we left Bajor?

232
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:54,649
Do you think they simply
slipped from our minds?

233
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,859
And who would you guess

234
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:01,989
was in charge of the Cardassian
withdrawal from Bajor?

235
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,036
<i>I don't know how to thank you.</i>

236
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,289
Don't thank me
too quickly, Dukat.

237
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,375
The boy could be returned
to his adoptive parents.

238
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:16,129
<i>After the accusations</i>
<i>this businessman has made...</i>

239
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,172
That's all it is for the moment,
an accusation.

240
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,216
(<i> sighs</i> ):
<i>We would not take kindly</i>

241
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,219
<i>to the boy being returned</i>
<i>to the Bajorans.</i>

242
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,388
<i>However, I have</i>
<i>complete confidence</i>

243
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:28,141
<i>in your ability to be</i>
<i>thorough, Commander.</i>

244
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,143
<i>And if there's</i>
<i>anything I can do...</i>

245
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,103
As a matter of fact, there is.

246
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:35,440
If it is decided the boy is
to be returned to Cardassia,

247
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,066
to whom would we return him?

248
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,568
It might help to find out

249
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,194
if he still has
any living relatives.

250
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,862
<i>I was going to suggest</i>

251
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,282
<i>that you forward us</i>
<i>a sample of the boy's DNA</i>

252
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,743
<i>and we'll run it through</i>
<i>our data banks immediately.</i>

253
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,620
We'll send it right away.

254
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,163
Excuse me, Gul Dukat.

255
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,751
I have a question.

256
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:58,338
<i>Doctor... Bashir, isn't it?</i>

257
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,922
Yes. Isn't it true

258
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,717
that you were in charge
of the evacuation of Bajor?

259
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,803
<i>Yes, I was.</i>

260
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:07,806
Then it would have been
your responsibility to ensure

261
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,223
that these orphans were, in
fact, part of that evacuation,

262
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,602
yet you chose
to leave them behind.

263
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,020
Why?

264
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:20,276
<i>I did not choose to leave</i>
<i>them behind, Doctor.</i>

265
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,613
<i>I was ordered</i>
<i>to leave them behind.</i>

266
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,239
Ordered.

267
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,574
By whom?

268
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,451
<i>By the civilian leaders...</i>

269
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:29,452
BASHIR:
Excuse me...

270
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,704
but, if I understand

271
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,330
the Cardassian political
system correctly

272
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,248
civilian leaders
have no direct authority

273
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,333
over military officers.

274
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,210
<i>Who's been tutoring you</i>

275
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,713
<i>in Cardassian</i>
<i>social studies, Doctor?</i>

276
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:44,008
Your old friend, Garak.

277
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:48,555
<i>Well, then perhaps you should</i>
<i>remind my old friend Garak</i>

278
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,515
<i>the withdrawal of Bajor</i>
<i>was a decision</i>

279
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:55,603
<i>made by the civilian leaders--</i>
<i>one which I clearly opposed.</i>

280
00:14:55,603 --> 00:15:00,149
<i>And yes, they made the decision</i>
<i>to leave the orphans behind,</i>

281
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,986
<i>a decision</i>
<i>I've regretted ever since.</i>

282
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,072
<i>Thank you for your concern,</i>
<i>Doctor.</i>

283
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,616
<i>Good day, Commander.</i>

284
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,286
He's lying.

285
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:16,416
Is that an opinion, or do you
have evidence to support it?

286
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,000
I have Garak.
Garak?

287
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,419
He seems to think

288
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,838
there's more going on here
than we realize.

289
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,340
What exactly
does he think is going on?

290
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,426
I'm not sure.

291
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:31,013
He doesn't actually tell me
what he really thinks.

292
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,683
I sort of have to deduce it.

293
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:38,521
Ah, so, you deduced that Garak
thinks Dukat is lying

294
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,481
about something
you're not sure of

295
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:44,652
and you proceeded to interrupt
my conversation to confront him

296
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,529
about whatever
that might be.

297
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,239
I'm sorry, Commander.

298
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,366
It just seemed an opportune...

299
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,659
Don't apologize.

300
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:55,413
It's been the high point
of my day.

301
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,290
Don't do it again.

302
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,542
DAX:
Why would Garak

303
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,168
want to undermine Gul Dukat?

304
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,629
I'm not really sure.

305
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,171
I don't think he likes
Gul Dukat very much.

306
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,675
I'd like to ask Garak
about this myself.

307
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:11,178
Have him in my office
at 2100 hours.

308
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,264
Yes, sir.

309
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:26,736
Hi.

310
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:27,779
Hi.

311
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,322
Here, let me.

312
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,364
Oh, thanks.

313
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,786
Good idea.

314
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,537
What?

315
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,705
Well, three settings.

316
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,081
I assume you
sent Molly over

317
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,000
to stay with
the Fredericks.

318
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,627
She's asleep.

319
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,838
She and Rugal
played all afternoon.

320
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:45,964
He wore her out.

321
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,135
(<i> softly</i> ):
You let them play together?

322
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,679
Why not?

323
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:56,056
The boy almost bit
somebody's hand off.

324
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:59,602
(<i> whispering</i> ):
I was with them all afternoon.

325
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:00,937
He's not like that.

326
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,063
He's really very gentle.

327
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:06,233
"Gentle" was bred out of these
Cardassians a long time ago.

328
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,695
You know...

329
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:14,492
that was a very ugly
thing you just said.

330
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:15,785
I only said...

331
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,829
I don't need
to hear it twice.

332
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,374
Rugal,
dinner's ready.

333
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,384
I hope you like it...

334
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,947
Keiko...

335
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,909
darling, what is it?

336
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:58,077
I found some Cardassian recipes

337
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,705
in the memory bank
of our food replicator.

338
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,665
It's a stew

339
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,710
made with Cardassian
<i>zabo</i> meat.

340
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,340
I thought Rugal might enjoy

341
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,635
a dish that's popular
on his own world.

342
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,039
Can't sleep?

343
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,667
What are they going
to do with me?

344
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,502
Oh, I'm not sure.

345
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:33,255
You might have something
to say about that, you know.

346
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,592
You should be telling
Commander Sisko what you want.

347
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,762
I want to go home.

348
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,014
Well, he'll understand that.

349
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,682
You're a Cardassian

350
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,685
and they should have taken
you home when they left.

351
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,979
No, I mean<i> home.</i>

352
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:49,355
To Bajor.

353
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,825
It must be
tough for you.

354
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:04,037
You know,
living on Bajor?

355
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,663
Why?

356
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:06,998
Being Cardassian.

357
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:09,291
That's not my fault!

358
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,544
I was born that way.

359
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,629
That's not what I meant.

360
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,883
There's nothing wrong
with being a Cardassian.

361
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,926
Yes, there is.

362
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:22,388
Who taught you that?

363
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,973
It's the truth.

364
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,599
Everybody knows it.

365
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,897
How do your parents
feel about Cardassians?

366
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,773
They hate them.

367
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:37,028
Why would you want to live
with someone who hates you?

368
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:40,781
They hate<i> other Cardassians,</i>
not me.

369
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,325
My parents have never
done anything wrong to me.

370
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,162
Oh, come on,
even<i> I</i> got my bottom

371
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:49,123
whacked by my dad once or twice.

372
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:50,958
Not me.

373
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:55,254
My parents follow
the teachings of the Prophets.

374
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,257
What do you think
of Cardassians?

375
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,466
Me?

376
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:05,014
Well, I... I can't say, really.

377
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,307
Why not?

378
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:11,979
Well, you can't judge
a whole race of people.

379
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:16,567
You can't hate all Cardassians
or all Klingons

380
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,152
or all humans.

381
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:20,821
I've met some Cardassians
I didn't like.

382
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,490
And I've met some I did.

383
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,118
Like you.

384
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:32,332
Do you know how many Bajorans
the Cardassians murdered

385
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,876
during the occupation?

386
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,461
Over ten million.

387
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,838
We had a test
on it in school.

388
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,093
I wish I wasn't Cardassian.

389
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,867
Come, Doctor, get dressed.

390
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,203
We need
to be going.

391
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:10,496
Going?

392
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,748
Going where?

393
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,501
To Bajor.

394
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:19,880
I assume this couldn't wait
until morning?

395
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,174
No, sir, I...

396
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:22,842
I need to use
a runabout.

397
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,261
I'm waiting.

398
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:28,889
It's Garak, sir.

399
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,309
He wants to go to Bajor.

400
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:32,810
Bajor? For what?

401
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:35,604
He wouldn't tell me.

402
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,774
Well, by all means.

403
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,609
Will one runabout be enough?

404
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,528
COM OFFICER:
Ops to Sisko.

405
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,113
Go ahead.

406
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,740
Commander, there's an urgent
communication for you

407
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,825
from Gul Dukat.

408
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:59,295
I'm sorry to disturb you
at such a late hour, Commander

409
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:02,464
but thanks to the DNA gene type
you sent us

410
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,551
we've discovered the boy
is actually the son

411
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:09,680
of one of our most prominent
politicians-- Kotran Pa'Dar.

412
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,431
When was Pa'Dar on Bajor?

413
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,391
Over eight years ago.

414
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:16,603
He was Exarch for a Cardassian
settlement there

415
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,981
and the boy was believed
to have died

416
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,067
in a Bajoran terrorist attack.

417
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,609
Has he been told
his son is alive?

418
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,320
<i>Of course!</i>

419
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,114
<i>As you can imagine,</i>
<i>he's overwhelmed with joy.</i>

420
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:30,326
<i>He's already on his way</i>
<i>to the station to reclaim him.</i>

421
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,494
It's not that simple.

422
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,080
<i>I don't understand.</i>

423
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,707
The boy wants
to go back to Bajor.

424
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:38,625
<i>Back?</i>

425
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,170
<i>To live</i>
<i>with the same brutal people?</i>

426
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,839
I can't find any evidence
to support that accusation.

427
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,300
I can't even find the man
who made it in the first place.

428
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,927
<i>Well, nevertheless,</i>

429
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,221
<i>once the boy finds out</i>
<i>his real father's alive,</i>

430
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:52,556
<i>surely he'll change his mind.</i>

431
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,351
<i>And even if he doesn't, it</i>
<i>would be in the boy's</i>
<i>best interests.</i>

432
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:56,643
We'll just have to see

433
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,436
what happens
when Pa'Dar gets here.

434
00:23:58,436 --> 00:23:59,897
Sisko out.

435
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:02,942
BASHIR:
It can't be just
a coincidence, sir.

436
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,735
Garak must have heard
about Pa'Dar

437
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,028
before he woke me up.

438
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:09,698
What could he be
looking for on Bajor?

439
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,909
There's only one way
to find out.

440
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,222
Excuse me, is this the Tozhat
Resettlement Center?

441
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,765
Yes.

442
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:37,143
I'm Dr. Bashir
from Federation Command

443
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,727
at Deep Space 9.

444
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,854
I've been trying to find
some information

445
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,731
on a Cardassian
war orphan

446
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,858
who was apparently placed
for adoption here.

447
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,069
Yes, the Bajorans have
opened their hearts

448
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,446
to many abandoned children.

449
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:50,614
The boy's name
was Rugal

450
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,074
and the Bajoran
who adopted him

451
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,867
was named Proka Migdal.

452
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:56,162
I don't recognize
either of the names.

453
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,537
What was it you were trying

454
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:59,457
to find out
about them?

455
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:04,044
Yes... exactly what<i> are</i> we
trying to find out about them?

456
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:07,714
The circumstances surrounding
the young man's adoption.

457
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,050
It took place
about eight years ago.

458
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,927
The Cardassians
were still here.

459
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,637
You'll never find anything
from back then.

460
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,014
Oh, the Cardassians

461
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,141
are quite meticulous
record keepers, madam.

462
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:20,019
They've taught many worlds,
including this one

463
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,437
how to keep records.

464
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,272
I find it difficult
to believe

465
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,316
that none exist
from that period.

466
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:28,068
Certainly computer entries
were made on a regular basis.

467
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,111
I wouldn't know.

468
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,237
I wasn't a volunteer then.

469
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,990
I was in the underground.

470
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,450
Really?

471
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,328
Perhaps we<i> have</i> met.

472
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:39,621
Look, can we just
check your computers?

473
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,707
Our computers
don't work.

474
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,876
I can't get a technician
to come out.

475
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,170
We're not exactly
a top priority.

476
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,340
Perhaps I can be of service.

477
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:54,303
<i>You</i> can fix computers?

478
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:58,098
Oh, I dabble with isolinear
data subprocessors.

479
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,226
It's... a hobby of mine.

480
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:07,649
I continue
to underestimate you, Garak.

481
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,609
Oh, it's no
more difficult

482
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,820
than sewing on
a button, actually.

483
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,863
Excuse me.

484
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:16,075
You carry this
everywhere with you, do you?

485
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,493
A simple tailoring tool.

486
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:19,537
You'd be surprised
how often

487
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:21,579
someone needs
their pants let out.

488
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:22,748
Oh, it's not there.

489
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,375
BASHIR:
What's not there?

490
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:26,419
Rugal's name, his father's
name-- none of it.

491
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:28,586
You managed to find
eight-year-old files
that quickly?

492
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:29,922
Oh, it's simply a question

493
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,090
of knowing what you're
looking for, Doctor.

494
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,466
Excuse me.

495
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:33,633
Now, it's either
been misfiled

496
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,177
or under a wrong name

497
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:37,930
or this is entirely the
wrong resettlement center.

498
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,182
I'm not going to another
district until I know...

499
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:42,476
That won't be necessary.

500
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,853
We can access the files
to this entire province

501
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,106
from here and download
them into a data clip.

502
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,108
BASHIR:
But that'll be
thousands of files.

503
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,026
Tens of thousands,
actually.

504
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:04,748
Excuse me, sir.

505
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,751
Have you come to take us
back to Cardassia?

506
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:12,298
I'm afraid not, child.

507
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:13,507
Come, Doctor.

508
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,260
I believe you'll find
your computer system

509
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,720
fully functional
now, madam.

510
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,116
Computer, set up
a data bank

511
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,619
cross-referencing
age groups, sex

512
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:43,661
year of adoption...

513
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:45,663
Computer, disregard
that request

514
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,833
and shut down
all engines.

515
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:55,549
I'm sorry you're upset
about the orphans.

516
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,595
Children without parents

517
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:02,014
have no status
in Cardassian society.

518
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,433
The situation
is most unfortunate

519
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,352
but I don't make the rules.

520
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:07,894
But you do
play the game

521
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,396
don't you, Garak?

522
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,064
And there is a game
being played

523
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,858
right now as we speak,
isn't there?

524
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:15,194
There are always games, Doctor.

525
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:17,571
The trouble is,
I don't have the slightest idea

526
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:20,866
what this game is all about.

527
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,700
So you're going to tell me
what's going on

528
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,203
inside that plain
and simple head of yours

529
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,579
my Cardassian friend

530
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,831
or we're going to sit here
until we rot.

531
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:31,293
Tell me, Doctor...

532
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:34,588
why do you think
the Cardassians left Bajor?

533
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:38,676
Gul Dukat said it was a decision
made by your civilian leaders.

534
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:40,802
And isn't it interesting

535
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:44,431
that one of Cardassia's
most notable civilian leaders

536
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,808
has recently entered
this scenario?

537
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:50,103
Rugal's father?

538
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:53,857
You're saying Kotran Pa'Dar
was involved in the decision

539
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,108
to evacuate Bajor?

540
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,485
Very good, Doctor!

541
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:58,696
I'm glad to see our
little get-togethers

542
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:00,447
haven't gone for naught.

543
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:05,452
Which makes him a political
enemy of Gul Dukat's

544
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:08,247
who lost his job as Prefect
when they withdrew.

545
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,165
And seemingly out of nowhere

546
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,543
Dukat takes an interest
in this orphan boy

547
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:14,961
who recently arrives
on our station,

548
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:18,173
and then soon afterwards,
with Gul Dukat's assistance,

549
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:24,430
we discover that the orphan boy
isn't really an orphan boy

550
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,682
but Pa'Dar's
long-lost son.

551
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,642
Another coincidence?

552
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:32,062
I believe in coincidences.

553
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:35,774
Coincidences happen every day.

554
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,944
But I don't trust coincidences.

555
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,907
I am Kotran Pa'Dar.

556
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,368
Miles O'Brien.
Come in.

557
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,791
Sit down.

558
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,673
Where is my son?

559
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:00,716
Oh, he's with my wife.

560
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:01,967
They'll be back shortly.

561
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:08,265
I thought it might be
a good idea if we talked first.

562
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,269
Your son, Rugal...

563
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:15,981
At least they didn't
change his name.

564
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:20,193
When was the last
time you saw him?

565
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:23,947
On Bajor-- he had just
had his fourth birthday.

566
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,617
He probably doesn't
even remember me.

567
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:29,035
Does he?

568
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,204
I think he spent
most of his life

569
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,872
trying to forget you.

570
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,917
I don't think
I understand.

571
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,128
The boy hates everything he is.

572
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:40,798
He hates Cardassians,
he hates being a Cardassian.

573
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:43,467
Yes, I've heard those stories.

574
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:47,304
Well, I suppose after growing up
among the Bajorans...

575
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:50,223
but now that I'm back
in his life...

576
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,435
Well, he... may not want you
back in his life.

577
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,354
I am his father.

578
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:03,028
Mr. O'Brien, I know very little
about human culture.

579
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:05,739
I don't know
how you view the family.

580
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:09,034
We'd do almost anything
to protect our families.

581
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,994
I have a daughter myself.

582
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:14,998
She's four-- the same age
your son was when you lost him.

583
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:18,251
Then I expect you can imagine
what I'm feeling right now.

584
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:22,464
On Cardassia,
family is everything.

585
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:26,426
We care for our parents and
children with equal devotion.

586
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,512
In some households

587
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,348
four generations
eat at the same table.

588
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:35,227
Family... is everything.

589
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:38,564
And I have failed in my
responsibility to my family.

590
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:41,650
You had no way of knowing
he was still alive.

591
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,820
I should have tried harder!

592
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,073
I should have looked everywhere!

593
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:54,538
To abandon my son, to allow him
to be raised by a Bajoran...

594
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:59,626
I have disgraced everything
that a Cardassian believes in.

595
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,044
(<i> door opens</i> )

596
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:23,483
Hello, Rugal.

597
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,119
Do you remember my face?

598
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,290
Even a little?

599
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:41,627
No.

600
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,507
Would you like to see
some pictures of you

601
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,675
when you were a child?

602
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:49,676
No.

603
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:50,719
Hey.

604
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,903
Rugal...

605
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:10,405
you have
to understand.

606
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:14,910
There was nothing
left of the house

607
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,578
after the attack.

608
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,748
Your mother was dead

609
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,166
and you...

610
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:26,797
I... cried for you, Rugal.

611
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:29,549
I missed you so much.

612
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:32,469
I could not even stay on Bajor.

613
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:36,890
It was too close to the
happy memories of you.

614
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,809
It was your own fault.

615
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:40,727
You deserved it.

616
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,729
You are a Cardassian.

617
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,983
What the Bajorans did,
they had to do.

618
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:47,734
I understand
why you say that.

619
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,569
You can't understand!

620
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,865
You are a Cardassian
butcher, a butcher!

621
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:55,033
They killed your son
for your crimes.

622
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,034
Rugal...

623
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:59,037
You are not my father.

624
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,915
And I will never go
back to Cardassia.

625
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:03,416
Never.

626
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,347
I have no intention
of allowing

627
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:19,850
a Bajoran court to rule
on the custody of my son.

628
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,685
PROKA:
You gave up custody

629
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,353
when you abandoned him here.

630
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:25,230
He is my natural-born child.

631
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,273
As Cardassian law
clearly...

632
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:30,276
There is no more
Cardassian law on Bajor.

633
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,320
Gentlemen...
I think you may be in need

634
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,280
of an arbitrator to settle this.

635
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,909
Well, it must be someone

636
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:40,620
who is neither a Cardassian
nor a Bajoran.

637
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,788
What about you?

638
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,791
I'd be willing.

639
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,126
But wouldn't you have objections

640
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,504
because of the Federation's
relationship with Bajor?

641
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:54,009
No, Commander.
You are a father, too.

642
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,761
You would be acceptable to me.

643
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,723
Very well then.
I'll schedule a...

644
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:01,558
Odo to Commander Sisko.

645
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,268
Yes, Odo, what is it?

646
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,896
I thought you might be
interested to know.

647
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:08,690
Gul Dukat has just arrived
on the station.

648
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:22,203
SISKO:
<i>Station Log, Stardate 47177.2.</i>

649
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:25,082
<i>The arrival of Gul Dukat</i>
<i>only powers my suspicion</i>

650
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:29,044
<i>that we are being manipulated</i>
<i>in some unseen manner.</i>

651
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,421
<i>Dr. Bashir and Garak</i>
<i>continue to search</i>

652
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:34,674
<i>for anything of relevance</i>
<i>in the adoption files.</i>

653
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:37,135
<i>So far they've found nothing.</i>

654
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,596
<i>And the decision</i>
<i>on custody for Rugal</i>

655
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:41,765
<i>cannot wait much longer.</i>

656
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,517
You've come a long way

657
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,436
just to view
a custody hearing.

658
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:48,730
Pa'Dar is
an eminent member

659
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,816
of the Civilian
Assembly.

660
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:54,027
This matter has generated
a great deal of interest

661
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:56,529
at the highest levels
of our government.

662
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,364
So you're here representing
your government.

663
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,117
Not exactly.

664
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:03,495
I like to think I'm here
representing the children--

665
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:06,414
all of the children who
were abandoned on Bajor.

666
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:10,209
I want to see Rugal
reunited with his father.

667
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:16,842
Well, I'm sure Pa'Dar is
grateful for your support.

668
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,553
Because I was
under the impression

669
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,597
that you were
political adversaries.

670
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,057
Isn't that so, Pa'Dar?

671
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:28,186
We have disagreed in the past.

672
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,480
But, Commander, I don't see...

673
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,357
I must object, Commander.

674
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:35,777
The past is the past--
it has no relevance here.

675
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:38,363
What is relevant
are the children.

676
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:42,159
What are we going to do
about the children?

677
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:46,079
If you don't mind, I'd like
for you to go over the events

678
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,956
leading up to the disappearance

679
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:50,959
of Rugal
eight years ago.

680
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,670
How perfectly
foolish of me.

681
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,798
Don't tell me you've
decided you were wrong.

682
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:59,467
Not after searching
7,420 files

683
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,178
for a misspelling.

684
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:03,847
Dukat is much
smarter than that.

685
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:05,557
Than what?

686
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,934
Think about it, Doctor.

687
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:11,188
He would never have left
a file to be found.

688
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:13,106
Do you really think he
purged the file on Rugal?

689
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:14,900
<i>I</i> would have.

690
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,069
There was something
in that file

691
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:19,529
he didn't want
anybody to see.

692
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:21,280
Exactly.

693
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,492
We have one last chance--
to find the person

694
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,327
who wrote that file
in the first place.

695
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,954
How do you ever
hope to find him?

696
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,873
Her.

697
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,875
Her? How do you know?

698
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,252
Because I've already
found her name-- Jomat Luson.

699
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:42,761
Do you remember anything
from back then, Rugal?

700
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,930
No.

701
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,515
Do you remember
being adopted?

702
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,308
No.

703
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:55,440
What's the first thing
you do remember?

704
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:00,278
My father teaching me
how to swim.

705
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,952
<i>I know exactly the one</i>
<i>you're talking about.</i>

706
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:08,620
You do?

707
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,831
<i>He was the only Cardassian boy</i>
<i>we had at the time.</i>

708
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,332
<i>We had several girls.</i>

709
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,043
Are you sure
his name was Rugal?

710
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,878
<i>That's what we were told.</i>

711
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,421
Somebody<i> told</i> you
his name?

712
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,882
<i>Yes, that was</i>
<i>the most unusual thing</i>

713
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:22,592
<i>about his arrival.</i>

714
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:25,095
<i>Virtually all of the other</i>
<i>Cardassian children</i>

715
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:28,514
<i>turned in to us were found</i>
<i>on the streets by Bajorans.</i>

716
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:31,684
<i>Rugal was brought in</i>
<i>by a Cardassian.</i>

717
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:34,520
A Cardassian military
officer, by any chance?

718
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,898
<i>Yes, as a matter of fact,</i>
<i>she was.</i>

719
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,566
A woman.

720
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:42,737
<i>I don't remember her name,</i>
<i>but she was attached</i>

721
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:46,532
<i>to the command post</i>
<i>at Terok Nor.</i>

722
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:49,161
<i>Is there anything else, Doctor?</i>

723
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:56,126
The boy accused him
of being a butcher.

724
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:58,837
He hates
Cardassians, sir.

725
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,588
Pa'Dar was heartbroken.

726
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:03,508
I can only imagine
how I'd feel in his shoes.

727
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,969
(<i> door opens</i> )

728
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,346
Commander...

729
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,099
can I ask
a few questions?

730
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:23,444
Chief, didn't
Pa'Dar tell you

731
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:26,447
about the humiliation
he feels right now?

732
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,283
He said he
had disgraced

733
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:30,994
everything a Cardassian
believes in.

734
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:33,121
Has news of your
son's discovery

735
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,414
become public knowledge
on Cardassia?

736
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,250
The government
has not chosen

737
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,252
to reveal it
to the people yet.

738
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:41,462
What happens when
it<i> is</i> revealed?

739
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:42,755
It will be the end

740
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,883
of my political
career.

741
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,592
That's a shame...

742
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,970
especially
considering the timing.

743
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,471
The timing?

744
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,765
Isn't there an inquiry
about to begin

745
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,227
concerning the Cardassians
who were involved

746
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:57,520
in the attempted
military coup on Bajor?

747
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,856
Yes.

748
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:03,360
And isn't Gul Dukat one of
the key witness in that inquiry?

749
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,486
This is irrelevant
and insulting.

750
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,031
Commander, you've
lost control here.

751
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:10,825
Yes, it seems that I have.

752
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,828
I suggest we return to the issue
of the children.

753
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,247
All right.

754
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:17,916
Let's talk
about children.

755
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,292
Have you ever been

756
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,502
to the Tozhat Resettlement
Center on Bajor

757
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,461
where Rugal was adopted?

758
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,172
Never.
Of course,

759
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:25,464
Tozhat is the province
where Pa'Dar

760
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,008
was stationed
eight years ago.

761
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:29,052
I'm aware of that.

762
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:36,851
I've been trying to find records
of Rugal's adoption,

763
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,104
but they're missing
from the files.

764
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:41,814
How unfortunate.

765
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:45,318
Yes, but we have found someone
who was working at the Center

766
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:47,486
at the time Rugal
was brought in.

767
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:49,864
Do you know of a Bajoran
social volunteer

768
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,532
named Jomat Luson?

769
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,118
No.

770
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:56,204
Well, Jomat Luson remembers
Rugal being brought in

771
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:58,581
by a Cardassian military
officer--

772
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:02,252
a woman who seemed familiar
with him-- even knew his name.

773
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,005
Is there a question?

774
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:08,800
The question is whether
or not this officer

775
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,928
deliberately left the son
of Kotran Pa'Dar

776
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,430
at the relocation center

777
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,348
with the full knowledge
that he was not an orphan.

778
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:19,560
Perhaps even with the hopes
of humiliating Pa'Dar someday.

779
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:23,356
I wouldn't know.

780
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:26,692
Well, would you happen
to know, then, of a base

781
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:29,404
known during the occupation
as Terok Nor?

782
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:31,781
Terok Nor?

783
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:34,617
It was here,
this space station.

784
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,455
Jomat Luson clearly recalls

785
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:41,166
that the officer
who brought in Rugal

786
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,293
was attached to Terok Nor.

787
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:53,345
BASHIR:
Gul Dukat!

788
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:56,722
Who was the commanding officer
of Terok Nor eight years ago?

789
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,442
For the record

790
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:10,611
the commanding officer
of Terok Nor eight years ago

791
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,113
was Gul Dukat.

792
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:21,122
<i>Station Log, Stardate 47178.3.</i>

793
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:23,500
<i>After long and difficult</i>
<i>deliberations</i>

794
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,959
<i>I have decided to allow Pa'Dar</i>

795
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,045
<i>to take his son</i>
<i>back to Cardassia.</i>

796
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:29,422
<i>Although I am convinced</i>
<i>his Bajoran foster parents</i>

797
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:31,216
<i>treated him with love,</i>

798
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:34,677
<i>Rugal has been the clear victim</i>
<i>in this conspiracy.</i>

799
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:37,638
<i>I believe it's time</i>
<i>for his healing to begin.</i>

800
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:43,269
Your doctor has given me
the leverage I need, Commander.

801
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,562
Leverage?

802
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,564
Dukat will never
allow these events

803
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,024
to be made public now,

804
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:50,068
and I certainly won't
choose to discuss them.

805
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,110
A stalemate.

806
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,611
A stalemate.

807
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:55,156
You've helped me salvage
my political career.

808
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,366
I won't forget that.

809
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:57,742
Perhaps you will
use your influence

810
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:59,952
to help other Cardassian
orphans on Bajor.

811
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:02,955
Well, yes, we'll see.

812
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,582
O'BRIEN:
Remember
what I said.

813
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,584
If you ever want to come
back and visit them

814
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:09,170
just let me know
and I'll arrange it.

815
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:13,091
Hello, Rugal.
Ready to go?

816
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,392
I suppose
it'll take time.

817
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:41,660
But there's one
more question

818
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,996
I haven't
figured out, Garak.

819
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,458
Why did you want
to expose Dukat?

820
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:48,918
What's the truth
about you and him?

821
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:52,088
Truth, Doctor, is in
the eye of the beholder.

822
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:54,132
I never tell the truth

823
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,426
because I don't believe
there<i> is</i> such a thing.

824
00:43:56,426 --> 00:44:00,012
That's why I prefer
the straight-line simplicity

825
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,098
of cutting cloth.

826
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:04,267
So you're not
going to tell me.

827
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:07,019
But you don't need me
to tell you, my friend.

828
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,396
Just notice the details.

829
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:09,855
They're scattered
like crumbs

830
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:13,276
all over this table
we regularly share.

831
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,946
Until next time.
