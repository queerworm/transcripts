1
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,583
Ah.

2
00:00:15,626 --> 00:00:17,391
Tarkalean tea again, Doctor?

3
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,423
Yes, and you're drinking
Rokassa juice

4
00:00:19,467 --> 00:00:20,435
aren't you, Garak?

5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,529
How did you know?

6
00:00:21,572 --> 00:00:23,166
The odor is unmistakable.

7
00:00:24,245 --> 00:00:25,874
So it is.

8
00:00:25,915 --> 00:00:29,720
Rokassa juice soothes my nerves.

9
00:00:29,757 --> 00:00:32,855
I had a very demanding
customer today...

10
00:00:32,897 --> 00:00:37,066
a Bajoran engineer who comes
to the shop constantly

11
00:00:37,106 --> 00:00:38,096
just to plague me.

12
00:00:38,142 --> 00:00:39,805
You know, I've always
wondered about that...

13
00:00:39,846 --> 00:00:41,577
about who your steady
customers really are.

14
00:00:41,616 --> 00:00:43,586
I can't imagine Bajorans
frequenting a shop

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,781
run by a Cardassian.

16
00:00:44,824 --> 00:00:47,193
I like to think
that my expertise

17
00:00:47,229 --> 00:00:48,994
and willingness to serve

18
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:53,407
overcome any general resentment
any of my clientele may have.

19
00:00:53,442 --> 00:00:55,469
Ah... and perhaps
your expertise

20
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,074
and willingness to serve

21
00:00:57,117 --> 00:00:59,953
go so far as to establish
a certain... trust

22
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,823
between you and your customers?

23
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,353
Trust is very important.

24
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:08,137
And once they trust you,
they're much more open with you

25
00:01:08,175 --> 00:01:10,236
and they tell you things.

26
00:01:10,346 --> 00:01:14,685
Really, Doctor, must we
always play this game?

27
00:01:14,723 --> 00:01:17,924
I'm no more a spy
than you are...

28
00:01:17,962 --> 00:01:19,157
A doctor.

29
00:01:19,199 --> 00:01:20,600
I'm afraid

30
00:01:20,636 --> 00:01:23,005
you really do allow
your imagination

31
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,442
to run away with you.

32
00:01:24,477 --> 00:01:26,812
What else can I say
to finally convince you

33
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:28,478
that I'm just...

34
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:30,580
Plain, simple Garak?

35
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,683
Precisely.

36
00:01:33,363 --> 00:01:36,530
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

37
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:43,450
There's a table.

38
00:01:45,323 --> 00:01:46,518
Have a seat.

39
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:49,030
I'll get us all
some refreshment.

40
00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:00,952
Well, that was odd.

41
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:02,118
Do you know him?

42
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,423
On the contrary.

43
00:02:03,463 --> 00:02:06,493
I've never seen him before
in my life.

44
00:02:07,372 --> 00:02:09,433
I hope I'm not intruding

45
00:02:09,476 --> 00:02:11,947
but I couldn't help
noticing what a...

46
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:14,920
what a handsome young man
you have here.

47
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,814
I'm sorry I'm late.

48
00:04:30,857 --> 00:04:32,224
The damnedest thing
just happened.

49
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,455
Garak the tailor was attacked.

50
00:04:33,496 --> 00:04:34,486
Attacked where?

51
00:04:34,532 --> 00:04:35,500
At the Replimat.

52
00:04:35,534 --> 00:04:36,833
He was bitten on the hand.

53
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,669
Another unsatisfied customer?

54
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,975
He always cuts
the pants too long.

55
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:43,849
Actually, it was a boy...
a Cardassian boy.

56
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:44,875
I wasn't aware we had

57
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:46,788
any Cardassian children
on the station.

58
00:04:46,826 --> 00:04:48,523
We don't.

59
00:04:48,563 --> 00:04:50,260
He's just arrived
on a Bajoran transport

60
00:04:50,367 --> 00:04:52,497
with an adult Bajoran
who says he's his father.

61
00:04:52,538 --> 00:04:54,235
The boy was probably

62
00:04:54,275 --> 00:04:56,712
one of the orphans left behind
when the Cardassians pulled out.

63
00:04:56,748 --> 00:04:58,377
We had no choice
but to take care of them.

64
00:04:58,418 --> 00:05:01,185
You have an incoming
subspace transmission

65
00:05:01,224 --> 00:05:02,989
from Cardassia, Commander.

66
00:05:03,027 --> 00:05:04,826
It's Gul Dukat.

67
00:05:04,865 --> 00:05:06,459
In my office.

68
00:05:13,518 --> 00:05:15,614
Commander, it's been brought
to my attention

69
00:05:15,655 --> 00:05:18,719
that the sole Cardassian
living on your station

70
00:05:18,762 --> 00:05:20,254
has been assaulted.

71
00:05:20,332 --> 00:05:23,635
I'm surprised how quickly
the news reached you, Dukat.

72
00:05:23,673 --> 00:05:25,472
I only heard about it myself
a minute ago.

73
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,241
Well, is it true he was attacked

74
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:31,016
by a Cardassian boy brought
to the station by a Bajoran?

75
00:05:31,056 --> 00:05:33,721
A Cardassian boy appears
to be involved, yes.

76
00:05:35,365 --> 00:05:36,834
Exactly as I feared.

77
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:40,070
Exactly as I've been
warning my colleagues.

78
00:05:40,109 --> 00:05:42,478
Warning them?

79
00:05:42,515 --> 00:05:45,078
Cardassian war orphans,
Commander.

80
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,421
Abandoned when we left Bajor.

81
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,018
It's a disgrace

82
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:52,035
and obviously, these
children are being raised

83
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:53,595
to hate their own kind.

84
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,165
This incident is proof.

85
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:58,148
You're assuming a lot
from one incident.

86
00:05:58,182 --> 00:05:59,207
Am I?

87
00:05:59,252 --> 00:06:02,623
Then why would this boy
attack poor Garak?

88
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:05,392
An amiable fellow,
if ever there was one.

89
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,664
If you'd like,
I'll try to find out.

90
00:06:07,703 --> 00:06:10,300
That would be most
appreciated, Commander.

91
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:13,940
I need to find out everything
I can about this boy

92
00:06:13,983 --> 00:06:18,425
so that I can use his story in
my fight to bring these orphans

93
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,054
back to their homeland.

94
00:06:20,097 --> 00:06:21,326
This is a tragedy

95
00:06:21,433 --> 00:06:25,306
that all of Cardassia is
going to have to address.

96
00:06:26,946 --> 00:06:29,110
We didn't come here
to cause trouble.

97
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,815
Has this Garak
filed a complaint?

98
00:06:31,856 --> 00:06:33,519
No, but the Cardassian officials

99
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,496
asked that we look
into the incident.

100
00:06:35,531 --> 00:06:37,000
I wish they'd shown
as much concern

101
00:06:37,034 --> 00:06:39,631
as when they left my boy
and dozens like him

102
00:06:39,673 --> 00:06:41,267
to fend for themselves.

103
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,539
How did you come to adopt him?

104
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,744
My wife and I felt that Rugal
shouldn't suffer

105
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:46,310
for crimes committed by others.

106
00:06:46,355 --> 00:06:48,052
But why would he attack
another Cardassian?

107
00:06:48,092 --> 00:06:51,224
That Cardassian should have
minded his own business.

108
00:06:51,265 --> 00:06:53,064
Garak was only trying
to be friendly.

109
00:06:53,103 --> 00:06:55,574
The boy seemed terrified
of him on sight.

110
00:06:55,608 --> 00:06:57,909
The Cardassians are suggesting
that the Bajorans

111
00:06:57,947 --> 00:07:00,418
are raising these orphans
to hate their own people.

112
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:02,513
To hate Cardassians?

113
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:06,257
It shouldn't be too hard,
should it?

114
00:07:06,298 --> 00:07:09,031
We told him the truth,
Commander.

115
00:07:09,071 --> 00:07:14,071
The truth about what Cardassia
did to Bajor.

116
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:15,584
He needed to know.

117
00:07:15,619 --> 00:07:18,420
And for that,
I make no apologies.

118
00:07:20,296 --> 00:07:26,071
To us... he isn't even
one of them anymore.

119
00:07:26,109 --> 00:07:29,378
He isn't Cardassian.

120
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,443
He's Bajoran.

121
00:07:37,935 --> 00:07:41,272
And we love him

122
00:07:41,309 --> 00:07:44,771
just as if he was
our own flesh and blood.

123
00:07:51,798 --> 00:07:53,665
All right, here we go.

124
00:07:53,703 --> 00:07:54,693
Here we go.

125
00:07:54,738 --> 00:07:57,734
Come on now, baby, come on.

126
00:08:00,484 --> 00:08:03,285
Dabo!

127
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:14,438
There's nothing quite so
depressing as a winning streak

128
00:08:14,482 --> 00:08:16,179
that won't stop streaking.

129
00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:17,448
Dabo!

130
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:18,683
Oh...

131
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,472
It would appear as if

132
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,135
you have this game
all figured out.

133
00:08:27,176 --> 00:08:29,841
Dabo!

134
00:08:29,882 --> 00:08:32,479
Dabo is a passion of mine.

135
00:08:33,824 --> 00:08:35,453
I remember you.
You're Doctor...

136
00:08:35,494 --> 00:08:36,484
Bashir.

137
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,498
Bashir, yes.

138
00:08:37,532 --> 00:08:38,500
How's the Cardassian?

139
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:39,901
Still has all his fingers,
I presume.

140
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:41,634
Yes... luckily there
were no broken bones.

141
00:08:41,674 --> 00:08:42,642
I've never seen a boy

142
00:08:42,676 --> 00:08:44,646
take a bite out of a man's hand
like that.

143
00:08:44,681 --> 00:08:46,082
He's a strange boy, Rugal.

144
00:08:46,118 --> 00:08:47,849
Do you know the family well?

145
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:48,914
Dabo!

146
00:08:48,957 --> 00:08:50,084
Do you?

147
00:08:50,126 --> 00:08:52,529
Look, this is really
none of my business.

148
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:53,862
Well, you were a witness.

149
00:08:53,902 --> 00:08:57,069
I just want to get my facts
right for the medical report.

150
00:08:57,109 --> 00:09:00,605
I'd really rather
you asked someone else.

151
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,711
Frankly, I don't
understand your attitude.

152
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:04,622
All I asked
was if you know them well.

153
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:06,094
Well enough.

154
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:11,471
I heard the father was
looking for a new job

155
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:14,240
several months ago,
and I offered to help.

156
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,275
I visited them on Bajor
several times.

157
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,484
Did you find anything troubling?

158
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:23,330
It must be torture for that boy,
living like that.

159
00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:26,862
Hated by people he thinks
of as his parents.

160
00:09:26,907 --> 00:09:30,848
Told day after day,
he's worthless Cardassian scum.

161
00:09:30,882 --> 00:09:33,547
Beaten if he even
looks the wrong way.

162
00:09:33,622 --> 00:09:35,820
Rugal is their revenge...

163
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,595
their revenge against
all Cardassians.

164
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:47,108
It is not true.

165
00:09:47,152 --> 00:09:48,245
It is not true!

166
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,779
Rugal will tell you.

167
00:09:49,824 --> 00:09:51,760
We have not mistreated him.

168
00:09:51,795 --> 00:09:53,424
Is this some Cardassian...

169
00:09:53,465 --> 00:09:57,304
There will be ample opportunity
to go over the matter in detail

170
00:09:57,341 --> 00:10:00,371
but during the investigation,
we'd like for Rugal

171
00:10:00,415 --> 00:10:03,388
to stay with our schoolteacher,
Mrs. O'Brien.

172
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:05,357
She's expecting him now.

173
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,591
What if I refuse?

174
00:10:08,632 --> 00:10:10,796
Then I'll have
to call security

175
00:10:10,837 --> 00:10:13,901
and have them remove him
from your quarters.

176
00:10:13,944 --> 00:10:16,643
I don't think either
of us wants that.

177
00:10:26,638 --> 00:10:27,937
Why?

178
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:29,672
It will be all right.

179
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:32,182
I didn't do anything wrong!

180
00:10:32,218 --> 00:10:34,348
I know, I know.

181
00:10:34,388 --> 00:10:36,381
It will be all right.

182
00:10:42,073 --> 00:10:44,510
I didn't do anything wrong.

183
00:10:44,545 --> 00:10:46,982
Nobody's accusing you
of a crime, Rugal.

184
00:10:47,016 --> 00:10:48,610
You're not being arrested.

185
00:10:48,653 --> 00:10:51,124
My name is Commander Sisko.

186
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:53,926
I believe you already
know Dr. Bashir.

187
00:10:53,965 --> 00:10:54,766
Hello, Rugal.

188
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:55,992
I'm sure all of this

189
00:10:56,035 --> 00:10:57,902
will be straightened out
in a day or two.

190
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,311
If you want to visit with
your father tomorrow, you can.

191
00:11:01,347 --> 00:11:03,112
Go on, Rugal.

192
00:11:03,151 --> 00:11:05,679
We'll talk tomorrow.

193
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,467
They won't hurt you.

194
00:11:11,502 --> 00:11:13,700
They're humans.

195
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:16,178
They're not Cardassians.

196
00:11:42,671 --> 00:11:45,302
Actually, something good did
come out of all of this, Garak.

197
00:11:45,343 --> 00:11:46,311
Oh?

198
00:11:46,346 --> 00:11:47,405
If it hadn't happened

199
00:11:47,448 --> 00:11:49,077
we'd never have discovered
Rugal's situation.

200
00:11:49,118 --> 00:11:50,313
And a bite on the hand
is certainly

201
00:11:50,421 --> 00:11:52,050
worth saving a boy's
life, wouldn't you say?

202
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:54,585
I suppose it depends
on whose hand.

203
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,727
Just joking, Doctor.

204
00:11:56,768 --> 00:11:58,635
Perhaps it might
even help Gul Dukat

205
00:11:58,672 --> 00:11:59,936
in his efforts to resolve

206
00:11:59,976 --> 00:12:01,775
the entire war orphan
predicament.

207
00:12:01,813 --> 00:12:03,373
I beg your pardon?

208
00:12:04,753 --> 00:12:06,723
Gul Dukat.

209
00:12:06,757 --> 00:12:09,194
He called Commander Sisko
right after this happened.

210
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,691
Apparently, he was quite
concerned with your well-being.

211
00:12:12,737 --> 00:12:13,966
You never mentioned

212
00:12:14,007 --> 00:12:15,032
you were friends.

213
00:12:17,581 --> 00:12:21,955
You said Dukat is doing
something about war orphans?

214
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,926
He wants to bring them
all home from Bajor.

215
00:12:23,962 --> 00:12:25,989
Does he?

216
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:29,029
Am I missing something?

217
00:12:29,073 --> 00:12:31,306
Tell me, Doctor...

218
00:12:31,345 --> 00:12:34,181
is there a single trait
you would ascribe

219
00:12:34,217 --> 00:12:36,518
to me and my fellow Cardassians?

220
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:41,693
Would it not be
our attention to detail?

221
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:45,732
Do you think we simply forgot

222
00:12:45,776 --> 00:12:48,339
about those poor little orphans
when we left Bajor?

223
00:12:48,382 --> 00:12:54,123
Do you think they simply
slipped from our minds?

224
00:12:54,161 --> 00:12:56,359
And who, would you guess

225
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,537
was in charge of the Cardassian
withdrawal from Bajor?

226
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,444
I don't know how to thank you.

227
00:13:06,489 --> 00:13:08,653
Don't thank me too quickly,
Dukat.

228
00:13:08,693 --> 00:13:11,962
The boy could be returned
to his adoptive parents.

229
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,565
After the accusations
this businessman has made...

230
00:13:15,609 --> 00:13:17,773
That's all it is for the moment,
an accusation.

231
00:13:17,813 --> 00:13:19,612
We would not take kindly

232
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,817
to the boy being returned
to the Bajorans.

233
00:13:22,857 --> 00:13:24,987
However, I have
complete confidence

234
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:27,626
in your ability to be thorough,
Commander.

235
00:13:27,668 --> 00:13:29,729
And if there's
anything I can do...

236
00:13:29,773 --> 00:13:31,572
As a matter of fact, there is.

237
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,947
If it is decided the boy is
to be returned to Cardassia

238
00:13:34,984 --> 00:13:36,681
to whom would we return him?

239
00:13:36,721 --> 00:13:38,122
It might help to find out

240
00:13:38,158 --> 00:13:40,185
if he still has
any living relatives.

241
00:13:40,229 --> 00:13:41,356
I was going to suggest

242
00:13:41,398 --> 00:13:43,733
that you forward us
a sample of the boy's DNA

243
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,298
and we'll run it through
our data banks immediately.

244
00:13:46,342 --> 00:13:48,335
We'll send it right away.

245
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,747
Excuse me, Gul Dukat.

246
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,289
I have a question.

247
00:13:54,327 --> 00:13:57,960
Doctor... Bashir, isn't it?

248
00:13:58,001 --> 00:13:59,230
Yes. Isn't it true

249
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:02,175
that you were in charge
of the evacuation of Bajor?

250
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,271
Yes, I was.

251
00:14:04,315 --> 00:14:07,116
Then it would have been
your responsibility to ensure

252
00:14:07,154 --> 00:14:09,921
that these orphans were,
in fact, part of that evacuation

253
00:14:09,961 --> 00:14:12,091
yet you chose
to leave them behind.

254
00:14:12,132 --> 00:14:13,465
Why?

255
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,441
I did not choose to leave
them behind, Doctor.

256
00:14:19,548 --> 00:14:23,079
I was ordered
to leave them behind.

257
00:14:23,124 --> 00:14:24,593
Ordered.

258
00:14:24,626 --> 00:14:26,095
By whom?

259
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,793
By the civilian leaders...

260
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:28,801
Excuse me...

261
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:29,803
but, if I understand

262
00:14:29,838 --> 00:14:31,705
the Cardassian political
system correctly

263
00:14:31,742 --> 00:14:33,609
civilian leaders
have no direct authority

264
00:14:33,646 --> 00:14:34,705
over military officers.

265
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,445
Who's been tutoring you

266
00:14:36,486 --> 00:14:39,185
in Cardassian
social studies, Doctor?

267
00:14:40,461 --> 00:14:43,662
Your old friend, Garak.

268
00:14:43,702 --> 00:14:47,939
Well, then perhaps you should
remind my old friend Garak

269
00:14:47,977 --> 00:14:51,007
the withdrawal of Bajor
was a decision

270
00:14:51,051 --> 00:14:55,493
made by the civilian leaders...
one which I clearly opposed.

271
00:14:55,527 --> 00:15:00,197
And yes, they made the decision
to leave the orphans behind

272
00:15:00,238 --> 00:15:03,939
a decision
I've regretted ever since.

273
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:05,972
Thank you for your concern,
Doctor.

274
00:15:06,017 --> 00:15:08,580
Good day, Commander.

275
00:15:10,762 --> 00:15:12,231
He's lying.

276
00:15:12,264 --> 00:15:16,035
Is that an opinion, or do you
have evidence to support it?

277
00:15:16,073 --> 00:15:17,041
I have Garak.

278
00:15:17,075 --> 00:15:18,043
Garak?

279
00:15:18,077 --> 00:15:19,045
He seems to think

280
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,517
there's more going on here
than we realize.

281
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:24,352
What exactly
does he think is going on?

282
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:26,293
I'm not sure.

283
00:15:26,328 --> 00:15:30,861
He doesn't actually tell me
what he really thinks.

284
00:15:30,906 --> 00:15:33,469
I sort of have to deduce it.

285
00:15:33,511 --> 00:15:38,352
Ah, so, you deduced that Garak
thinks Dukat is lying

286
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:40,256
about something
you're not sure of

287
00:15:40,293 --> 00:15:44,462
and you proceeded to interrupt
my conversation to confront him

288
00:15:44,502 --> 00:15:46,495
about whatever that might be.

289
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:48,065
I'm sorry, Commander.

290
00:15:48,109 --> 00:15:50,273
It just seemed an opportune...

291
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:51,476
Don't apologize.

292
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:55,252
It's been the high point
of my day.

293
00:15:55,292 --> 00:15:57,194
Don't do it again.

294
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:01,069
Why would Garak
want to undermine Gul Dukat?

295
00:16:01,105 --> 00:16:02,073
I'm not really sure.

296
00:16:02,107 --> 00:16:04,168
I don't think he likes
Gul Dukat very much.

297
00:16:04,212 --> 00:16:07,549
I'd like to ask Garak
about this myself.

298
00:16:07,586 --> 00:16:11,287
Have him in my office
at 2100 hours.

299
00:16:11,327 --> 00:16:13,320
Yes, sir.

300
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:26,727
Hi.

301
00:16:26,762 --> 00:16:27,752
Hi.

302
00:16:27,797 --> 00:16:29,391
Here, let me.

303
00:16:29,434 --> 00:16:30,424
Oh, thanks.

304
00:16:33,476 --> 00:16:34,775
Good idea.

305
00:16:34,812 --> 00:16:36,611
What?

306
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,845
Well, three settings.

307
00:16:37,886 --> 00:16:40,984
I assume you sent Molly over
to stay with the Fredericks.

308
00:16:41,026 --> 00:16:42,552
She's asleep.

309
00:16:42,597 --> 00:16:44,830
She and Rugal
played all afternoon.

310
00:16:44,867 --> 00:16:45,926
He wore her out.

311
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:51,274
You let them play together?

312
00:16:51,315 --> 00:16:52,648
Why not?

313
00:16:52,685 --> 00:16:56,090
The boy almost bit
somebody's hand off.

314
00:16:56,126 --> 00:16:59,531
I was with them all afternoon.

315
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:00,968
He's not like that.

316
00:17:01,004 --> 00:17:02,837
He's really very gentle.

317
00:17:02,874 --> 00:17:06,143
"Gentle" was bred out of these
Cardassians a long time ago.

318
00:17:06,181 --> 00:17:08,675
You know...

319
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:14,359
that was a very ugly thing
you just said.

320
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,835
I only said...

321
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,000
I don't need to hear it twice.

322
00:17:19,577 --> 00:17:21,444
Rugal, dinner's ready.

323
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:31,459
I hope you like it...

324
00:17:51,214 --> 00:17:52,706
Keiko...

325
00:17:52,817 --> 00:17:55,516
darling, what is it?

326
00:17:55,556 --> 00:17:57,720
I found some Cardassian recipes

327
00:17:57,762 --> 00:18:00,632
in the memory bank
of our food replicator.

328
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:01,688
It's a stew

329
00:18:01,822 --> 00:18:04,852
made with Cardassian
<i>zabo</i> meat.

330
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:10,502
I thought Rugal might enjoy

331
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,810
a dish that's popular
on his own world.

332
00:19:22,532 --> 00:19:24,058
Can't sleep?

333
00:19:24,102 --> 00:19:26,733
What are they going
to do with me?

334
00:19:26,775 --> 00:19:28,404
Oh, I'm not sure.

335
00:19:28,445 --> 00:19:32,250
You might have something
to say about that, you know.

336
00:19:32,287 --> 00:19:35,658
You should be telling
Commander Sisko what you want.

337
00:19:35,695 --> 00:19:38,827
I want to go home.

338
00:19:38,868 --> 00:19:40,167
Well, he'll understand that.

339
00:19:40,272 --> 00:19:41,571
You're a Cardassian

340
00:19:41,607 --> 00:19:44,705
and they should have taken
you home when they left.

341
00:19:44,748 --> 00:19:47,185
No, I mean home.

342
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,655
To Bajor.

343
00:19:56,908 --> 00:19:59,881
It must be tough for you.

344
00:19:59,914 --> 00:20:03,217
You know, living on Bajor?

345
00:20:03,255 --> 00:20:04,724
Why?

346
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:06,228
Being Cardassian.

347
00:20:06,262 --> 00:20:08,426
That's not my fault!

348
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:10,664
I was born that way.

349
00:20:10,705 --> 00:20:12,572
That's not what I meant.

350
00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:16,140
There's nothing wrong
with being a Cardassian.

351
00:20:16,184 --> 00:20:18,154
Yes, there is.

352
00:20:18,188 --> 00:20:21,593
Who taught you that?

353
00:20:21,629 --> 00:20:23,030
It's the truth.

354
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:24,899
Everybody knows it.

355
00:20:27,341 --> 00:20:30,142
How do your parents
feel about Cardassians?

356
00:20:30,181 --> 00:20:31,912
They hate them.

357
00:20:31,952 --> 00:20:36,155
Why would you want to live
with someone who hates you?

358
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:39,966
They hate other Cardassians,
not me.

359
00:20:40,002 --> 00:20:42,405
My parents have never
done anything wrong to me.

360
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:45,311
Oh, come on,
even I got my bottom

361
00:20:45,415 --> 00:20:48,319
whacked by my dad once or twice.

362
00:20:48,387 --> 00:20:50,118
Not me.

363
00:20:50,158 --> 00:20:54,532
My parents follow
the teachings of the Prophets.

364
00:20:54,568 --> 00:20:57,472
What do you think
of Cardassians?

365
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:58,841
Me?

366
00:21:00,481 --> 00:21:04,216
Well, I... I can't say, really.

367
00:21:04,256 --> 00:21:06,283
Why not?

368
00:21:06,394 --> 00:21:11,099
Well, you can't judge
a whole race of people.

369
00:21:11,138 --> 00:21:15,945
You can't hate all Cardassians
or all Klingons

370
00:21:15,981 --> 00:21:17,507
or all humans.

371
00:21:17,552 --> 00:21:20,319
I've met some Cardassians
I didn't like.

372
00:21:20,425 --> 00:21:22,919
And I've met some I did.

373
00:21:22,964 --> 00:21:24,797
Like you.

374
00:21:27,942 --> 00:21:31,815
Do you know how many Bajorans
the Cardassians murdered

375
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:33,443
during the occupation?

376
00:21:33,486 --> 00:21:34,921
Over ten million.

377
00:21:34,957 --> 00:21:37,394
We had a test on it in school.

378
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:41,799
I wish I wasn't Cardassian.

379
00:22:03,386 --> 00:22:06,985
Come, Doctor, get dressed.

380
00:22:07,028 --> 00:22:09,261
We need to be going.

381
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:10,700
Going?

382
00:22:10,735 --> 00:22:12,899
Going where?

383
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,673
To Bajor.

384
00:22:17,283 --> 00:22:19,982
I assume this couldn't wait
until morning?

385
00:22:20,022 --> 00:22:21,251
No, sir, I...

386
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:22,955
I need to use a runabout.

387
00:22:23,998 --> 00:22:25,297
I'm waiting.

388
00:22:26,437 --> 00:22:29,000
It's Garak, sir.

389
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:30,739
He wants to go to Bajor.

390
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:32,943
Bajor? For what?

391
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:35,779
He wouldn't tell me.

392
00:22:35,824 --> 00:22:38,763
Well, by all means.

393
00:22:38,797 --> 00:22:40,699
Will one runabout be enough?

394
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:42,796
Ops to Sisko.

395
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:44,138
Go ahead.

396
00:22:44,175 --> 00:22:46,703
Commander, there's an urgent
communication for you

397
00:22:46,748 --> 00:22:47,977
from Gul Dukat.

398
00:22:55,233 --> 00:22:59,231
I'm sorry to disturb you
at such a late hour, Commander

399
00:22:59,275 --> 00:23:02,407
but thanks to the DNA gene type
you sent us

400
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:05,650
we've discovered the boy
is actually the son

401
00:23:05,689 --> 00:23:09,653
of one of our most prominent
politicians... Kotran Pa'Dar.

402
00:23:09,698 --> 00:23:11,429
When was Pa'Dar on Bajor?

403
00:23:11,502 --> 00:23:13,438
Over eight years ago.

404
00:23:13,506 --> 00:23:16,638
He was Exarch for a Cardassian
settlement there

405
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,117
and the boy was believed
to have died

406
00:23:19,152 --> 00:23:21,213
in a Bajoran terrorist attack.

407
00:23:21,256 --> 00:23:23,226
Has he been told
his son is alive?

408
00:23:23,261 --> 00:23:24,286
Of course!

409
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:27,097
As you can imagine,
he's overwhelmed with joy.

410
00:23:27,137 --> 00:23:30,440
He's already on his way
to the station to reclaim him.

411
00:23:30,478 --> 00:23:32,574
It's not that simple.

412
00:23:32,615 --> 00:23:34,084
I don't understand.

413
00:23:34,118 --> 00:23:36,282
The boy wants
to go back to Bajor.

414
00:23:36,324 --> 00:23:38,055
Back?

415
00:23:38,094 --> 00:23:40,759
To live
with the same brutal people?

416
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,271
I can't find any evidence
to support that accusation.

417
00:23:43,305 --> 00:23:45,970
I can't even find the man
who made it in the first place.

418
00:23:46,011 --> 00:23:46,979
Well, nevertheless

419
00:23:47,013 --> 00:23:50,077
once the boy finds out
his real father's alive

420
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,113
surely he'll change his mind.

421
00:23:52,158 --> 00:23:54,857
And even if he doesn't, it would
be in the boy's best interests.

422
00:23:54,898 --> 00:23:56,162
We'll just have to see

423
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,193
what happens
when Pa'Dar gets here.

424
00:23:58,238 --> 00:23:59,537
Sisko out.

425
00:23:59,574 --> 00:24:02,410
It can't be just
a coincidence, sir.

426
00:24:02,447 --> 00:24:04,280
Garak must have heard
about Pa'Dar

427
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:05,479
before he woke me up.

428
00:24:05,555 --> 00:24:09,154
What could he be
looking for on Bajor?

429
00:24:09,195 --> 00:24:11,393
There's only one way
to find out.

430
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:32,872
Excuse me, is this the Tozhat
Resettlement Center?

431
00:24:32,914 --> 00:24:34,213
Yes.

432
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,551
I'm Dr. Bashir
from Federation Command

433
00:24:36,656 --> 00:24:38,148
at Deep Space 9.

434
00:24:38,193 --> 00:24:40,426
I've been trying to find
some information

435
00:24:40,464 --> 00:24:42,093
on a Cardassian war orphan

436
00:24:42,134 --> 00:24:44,503
who was apparently placed
for adoption here.

437
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:46,566
Yes, the Bajorans have
opened their hearts

438
00:24:46,645 --> 00:24:48,080
to many abandoned children.

439
00:24:49,117 --> 00:24:50,244
The boy's name was Rugal

440
00:24:50,285 --> 00:24:53,349
and the Bajoran who adopted him
was named Proka Migdal.

441
00:24:53,393 --> 00:24:55,694
I don't recognize
either of the names.

442
00:24:55,731 --> 00:24:58,795
What was it you were trying
to find out about them?

443
00:24:58,837 --> 00:25:03,095
Yes... exactly what are we
trying to find out about them?

444
00:25:03,229 --> 00:25:06,760
The circumstances surrounding
the young man's adoption.

445
00:25:06,803 --> 00:25:09,172
It took place
about eight years ago.

446
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:11,179
The Cardassians were still here.

447
00:25:11,213 --> 00:25:12,682
You'll never find anything
from back then.

448
00:25:12,716 --> 00:25:13,741
Oh, the Cardassians

449
00:25:13,785 --> 00:25:16,154
are quite meticulous
record keepers, madam.

450
00:25:16,191 --> 00:25:19,164
They've taught many worlds,
including this one

451
00:25:19,198 --> 00:25:20,565
how to keep records.

452
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:22,434
I find it difficult to believe

453
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:24,669
that none exist
from that period.

454
00:25:24,709 --> 00:25:28,480
Certainly computer entries
were made on a regular basis.

455
00:25:28,518 --> 00:25:30,181
I wouldn't know.

456
00:25:30,222 --> 00:25:31,212
I wasn't a volunteer then.

457
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,223
I was in the underground.

458
00:25:32,327 --> 00:25:33,887
Really?

459
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,595
Perhaps we have met.

460
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:39,130
Look, can we just
check your computers?

461
00:25:39,175 --> 00:25:40,940
Our computers don't work.

462
00:25:40,979 --> 00:25:43,348
I can't get a technician
to come out.

463
00:25:43,384 --> 00:25:45,480
We're not exactly
a top priority.

464
00:25:45,521 --> 00:25:48,790
Perhaps I can be of service.

465
00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:53,668
You can fix computers?

466
00:25:53,706 --> 00:25:57,441
Oh, I dabble with isolinear
data subprocessors.

467
00:25:57,482 --> 00:25:59,715
It's... a hobby of mine.

468
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:07,062
I continue
to underestimate you, Garak.

469
00:26:07,102 --> 00:26:08,799
Oh, it's no more difficult

470
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:11,140
than sewing on a button,
actually.

471
00:26:11,178 --> 00:26:12,373
Excuse me.

472
00:26:13,717 --> 00:26:15,346
You carry this
everywhere with you, do you?

473
00:26:15,387 --> 00:26:16,947
A simple tailoring tool.

474
00:26:16,991 --> 00:26:18,756
You'd be surprised how often

475
00:26:18,795 --> 00:26:20,993
someone needs
their pants let out.

476
00:26:21,033 --> 00:26:22,160
Oh, it's not there.

477
00:26:22,202 --> 00:26:23,694
What's not there?

478
00:26:23,739 --> 00:26:25,709
Rugal's name, his father's
name... none of it.

479
00:26:25,744 --> 00:26:28,011
You managed to find eight-
year-old files that quickly?

480
00:26:28,048 --> 00:26:29,016
Oh, it's simply a question

481
00:26:29,051 --> 00:26:30,611
of knowing what you're
looking for, Doctor.

482
00:26:30,654 --> 00:26:31,747
Excuse me.

483
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,282
Now, it's either been misfiled

484
00:26:33,394 --> 00:26:34,555
or under a wrong name

485
00:26:34,596 --> 00:26:37,295
or this is entirely
the wrong resettlement center.

486
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,500
I'm not going to another
district until I know...

487
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,738
That won't be necessary.

488
00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:44,307
We can access the files
to this entire province

489
00:26:44,351 --> 00:26:46,515
from here and download
them into a data clip.

490
00:26:46,556 --> 00:26:48,458
But that'll be
thousands of files.

491
00:26:48,494 --> 00:26:50,555
Tens of thousands, actually.

492
00:27:02,758 --> 00:27:04,159
Excuse me, sir.

493
00:27:04,195 --> 00:27:07,099
Have you come to take us
back to Cardassia?

494
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,533
I'm afraid not, child.

495
00:27:11,578 --> 00:27:12,911
Come, Doctor.

496
00:27:13,982 --> 00:27:16,749
I believe you'll find
your computer system

497
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:18,656
fully functional now, madam.

498
00:27:36,565 --> 00:27:38,661
Computer, set up a data bank

499
00:27:38,704 --> 00:27:41,198
cross-referencing
age groups, sex

500
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,042
year of adoption...

501
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,351
Computer, disregard that request
and shut down all engines.

502
00:27:52,066 --> 00:27:55,130
I'm sorry you're upset
about the orphans.

503
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:59,079
Children without parents

504
00:27:59,116 --> 00:28:01,610
have no status
in Cardassian society.

505
00:28:01,655 --> 00:28:03,853
The situation
is most unfortunate

506
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:05,759
but I don't make the rules.

507
00:28:05,797 --> 00:28:08,793
But you do play the game,
don't you, Garak?

508
00:28:08,836 --> 00:28:10,362
And there is a game being played

509
00:28:10,407 --> 00:28:12,138
right now as we speak,
isn't there?

510
00:28:12,177 --> 00:28:14,478
There are always games, Doctor.

511
00:28:14,516 --> 00:28:16,953
The trouble is,
I don't have the slightest idea

512
00:28:16,988 --> 00:28:20,291
what this game is all about.

513
00:28:20,329 --> 00:28:22,094
So you're going to tell me
what's going on

514
00:28:22,132 --> 00:28:23,897
inside that plain
and simple head of yours

515
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,063
my Cardassian friend

516
00:28:25,106 --> 00:28:27,373
or we're going to sit here
until we rot.

517
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:30,577
Tell me, Doctor...

518
00:28:30,618 --> 00:28:34,023
why do you think
the Cardassians left Bajor?

519
00:28:34,058 --> 00:28:38,261
Gul Dukat said it was a decision
made by your civilian leaders.

520
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:40,237
And isn't it interesting

521
00:28:40,272 --> 00:28:43,939
that one of Cardassia's
most notable civilian leaders

522
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,383
has recently entered
this scenario?

523
00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:49,551
Rugal's father?

524
00:28:49,593 --> 00:28:53,398
You're saying Kotran Pa'Dar
was involved in the decision

525
00:28:53,435 --> 00:28:54,768
to evacuate Bajor?

526
00:28:54,804 --> 00:28:56,033
Very good, Doctor!

527
00:28:56,074 --> 00:28:58,307
I'm glad to see
our little get-togethers

528
00:28:58,346 --> 00:29:00,009
haven't gone for naught.

529
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:04,720
Which makes him a political
enemy of Gul Dukat's

530
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:07,857
who lost his job as Prefect
when they withdrew.

531
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,836
And seemingly out of nowhere

532
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,171
Dukat takes an interest
in this orphan boy

533
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,544
who recently arrives
on our station

534
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:17,679
and then soon afterwards,
with Gul Dukat's assistance

535
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:24,192
we discover that the orphan boy
isn't really an orphan boy

536
00:29:24,236 --> 00:29:26,434
but Pa'Dar's long-lost son.

537
00:29:26,474 --> 00:29:28,205
Another coincidence?

538
00:29:28,244 --> 00:29:31,740
I believe in coincidences.

539
00:29:31,786 --> 00:29:35,317
Coincidences happen every day.

540
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,629
But I don't trust coincidences.

541
00:29:41,908 --> 00:29:43,707
I am Kotran Pa'Dar.

542
00:29:43,745 --> 00:29:46,182
Miles O'Brien.
Come in.

543
00:29:50,894 --> 00:29:52,523
Sit down.

544
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,311
Where is my son?

545
00:29:59,346 --> 00:30:00,507
Oh, he's with my wife.

546
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:01,882
They'll be back shortly.

547
00:30:03,321 --> 00:30:08,128
I thought it might be
a good idea if we talked first.

548
00:30:10,237 --> 00:30:11,900
Your son, Rugal...

549
00:30:12,976 --> 00:30:15,709
At least they didn't
change his name.

550
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:19,916
When was the last time
you saw him?

551
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:23,557
On Bajor... he had just
had his fourth birthday.

552
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,436
He probably doesn't
even remember me.

553
00:30:26,472 --> 00:30:28,807
Does he?

554
00:30:28,844 --> 00:30:32,649
I think he spent most of his
life trying to forget you.

555
00:30:33,822 --> 00:30:35,621
I don't think I understand.

556
00:30:35,726 --> 00:30:37,753
The boy hates everything he is.

557
00:30:37,797 --> 00:30:40,633
He hates Cardassians,
he hates being a Cardassian.

558
00:30:40,703 --> 00:30:43,004
Yes, I've heard those stories.

559
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:47,143
Well, I suppose after growing up
among the Bajorans...

560
00:30:47,184 --> 00:30:49,849
but now that I'm back
in his life...

561
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:53,330
Well, he... may not want you
back in his life.

562
00:30:53,364 --> 00:30:55,266
I am his father.

563
00:30:59,311 --> 00:31:02,842
Mr. O'Brien, I know
very little about human culture.

564
00:31:02,886 --> 00:31:05,380
I don't know
how you view the family.

565
00:31:05,425 --> 00:31:08,796
We'd do almost anything
to protect our families.

566
00:31:08,832 --> 00:31:10,631
I have a daughter myself.

567
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:14,633
She's four... the same age
your son was when you lost him.

568
00:31:14,712 --> 00:31:17,981
Then I expect you can imagine
what I'm feeling right now.

569
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:22,290
On Cardassia,
family is everything.

570
00:31:22,328 --> 00:31:26,394
We care for our parents and
children with equal devotion.

571
00:31:26,437 --> 00:31:28,304
In some households

572
00:31:28,341 --> 00:31:31,108
four generations
eat at the same table.

573
00:31:31,148 --> 00:31:34,883
Family... is everything.

574
00:31:34,922 --> 00:31:38,384
And I have failed in
my responsibility to my family.

575
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,403
You had no way of knowing
he was still alive.

576
00:31:41,437 --> 00:31:44,501
I should have tried harder!

577
00:31:44,544 --> 00:31:47,711
I should have looked everywhere!

578
00:31:47,818 --> 00:31:54,390
To abandon my son, to allow him
to be raised by a Bajoran...

579
00:31:54,433 --> 00:31:59,399
I have disgraced everything
that a Cardassian believes in.

580
00:32:21,493 --> 00:32:23,224
Hello, Rugal.

581
00:32:31,648 --> 00:32:33,744
Do you remember my face?

582
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:38,092
Even a little?

583
00:32:40,067 --> 00:32:41,366
No.

584
00:32:44,777 --> 00:32:47,112
Would you like to see
some pictures of you

585
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:48,413
when you were a child?

586
00:32:48,452 --> 00:32:49,420
No.

587
00:32:49,455 --> 00:32:50,445
Hey.

588
00:33:06,425 --> 00:33:07,654
Rugal...

589
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,063
you have to understand.

590
00:33:10,099 --> 00:33:16,341
There was nothing left of the
house after the attack.

591
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,478
Your mother was dead

592
00:33:19,521 --> 00:33:20,990
and you...

593
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:26,333
I... cried for you, Rugal.

594
00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:29,136
I missed you so much.

595
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:32,148
I could not even stay on Bajor.

596
00:33:32,182 --> 00:33:36,590
It was too close
to the happy memories of you.

597
00:33:36,624 --> 00:33:38,526
It was your own fault.

598
00:33:38,562 --> 00:33:40,464
You deserved it.

599
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,299
You are a Cardassian.

600
00:33:42,337 --> 00:33:45,572
What the Bajorans did,
they had to do.

601
00:33:45,611 --> 00:33:47,513
I understand why you say that.

602
00:33:47,548 --> 00:33:49,177
You can't understand!

603
00:33:49,219 --> 00:33:52,420
You are a Cardassian
butcher, a butcher!

604
00:33:52,459 --> 00:33:54,657
They killed your son
for your crimes.

605
00:33:54,765 --> 00:33:55,664
Rugal...

606
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:58,763
You are not my father.

607
00:33:58,807 --> 00:34:01,608
And I will never go
back to Cardassia.

608
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,171
Never.

609
00:34:15,443 --> 00:34:17,003
I have no intention of allowing

610
00:34:17,046 --> 00:34:19,643
a Bajoran court to rule
on the custody of my son.

611
00:34:19,686 --> 00:34:23,182
You gave up custody
when you abandoned him here.

612
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,163
He is my natural-born child.

613
00:34:25,198 --> 00:34:27,100
As Cardassian law clearly...

614
00:34:27,136 --> 00:34:29,664
There is no more
Cardassian law on Bajor.

615
00:34:29,741 --> 00:34:31,040
Gentlemen.

616
00:34:31,077 --> 00:34:34,244
I think you may be in need
of an arbitrator to settle this.

617
00:34:34,284 --> 00:34:36,847
Well, it must be someone

618
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:40,695
who is neither a Cardassian
nor a Bajoran.

619
00:34:40,765 --> 00:34:42,064
What about you?

620
00:34:43,338 --> 00:34:44,898
I'd be willing.

621
00:34:44,941 --> 00:34:47,037
But wouldn't you have objections

622
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:49,642
because of the Federation's
relationship with Bajor?

623
00:34:50,687 --> 00:34:54,092
No, Commander.
You are a father, too.

624
00:34:54,128 --> 00:34:56,064
You would be acceptable to me.

625
00:34:57,502 --> 00:34:59,837
Very well then.
I'll schedule a...

626
00:34:59,874 --> 00:35:01,673
Odo to Commander Sisko.

627
00:35:01,778 --> 00:35:03,304
Yes, Odo, what is it?

628
00:35:03,348 --> 00:35:05,979
I thought you might be
interested to know.

629
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:08,754
Gul Dukat has just arrived
on the station.

630
00:35:18,415 --> 00:35:22,686
Station Log, Stardate 47177.2.

631
00:35:22,724 --> 00:35:25,594
The arrival of Gul Dukat
only powers my suspicion

632
00:35:25,631 --> 00:35:29,366
that we are being manipulated
in some unseen manner.

633
00:35:29,405 --> 00:35:31,876
Dr. Bashir and Garak
continue to search

634
00:35:31,911 --> 00:35:35,043
for anything of relevance
in the adoption files.

635
00:35:35,085 --> 00:35:37,613
So far they've found nothing.

636
00:35:37,657 --> 00:35:39,958
And the decision
on custody for Rugal

637
00:35:39,996 --> 00:35:42,467
cannot wait much longer.

638
00:35:43,603 --> 00:35:46,940
You've come a long way
just to view a custody hearing.

639
00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:51,180
Pa'Dar is an eminent member
of the Civilian Assembly.

640
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,387
This matter has generated
a great deal of interest

641
00:35:54,427 --> 00:35:56,955
at the highest levels
of our government.

642
00:35:56,999 --> 00:35:58,969
So you're here representing
your government.

643
00:35:59,004 --> 00:36:00,701
Not exactly.

644
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,839
I like to think I'm here
representing the children...

645
00:36:03,882 --> 00:36:06,855
all of the children who
were abandoned on Bajor.

646
00:36:06,888 --> 00:36:10,795
I want to see Rugal
reunited with his father.

647
00:36:12,867 --> 00:36:17,309
Well, I'm sure Pa'Dar is
grateful for your support.

648
00:36:18,981 --> 00:36:20,917
Because I was
under the impression

649
00:36:20,952 --> 00:36:23,013
that you were
political adversaries.

650
00:36:23,057 --> 00:36:24,686
Isn't that so, Pa'Dar?

651
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:28,665
We have disagreed in the past.

652
00:36:28,702 --> 00:36:31,071
But, Commander, I don't see...

653
00:36:31,108 --> 00:36:32,805
I must object, Commander.

654
00:36:32,845 --> 00:36:36,148
The past is the past...
it has no relevance here.

655
00:36:36,185 --> 00:36:38,816
What is relevant
are the children.

656
00:36:38,858 --> 00:36:42,229
What are we going to do
about the children?

657
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:46,001
If you don't mind, I'd like
for you to go over the events

658
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:51,006
leading up to the disappearance
of Rugal eight years ago.

659
00:36:51,051 --> 00:36:53,648
How perfectly foolish of me.

660
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:56,857
Don't tell me you've decided
you were wrong.

661
00:36:56,931 --> 00:37:01,202
Not after searching 7,420 files
for a misspelling.

662
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,973
Dukat is much smarter than that.

663
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:05,540
Than what?

664
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:07,816
Think about it, Doctor.

665
00:37:07,922 --> 00:37:11,089
He would never have left
a file to be found.

666
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:13,190
Do you really think he
purged the file on Rugal?

667
00:37:13,234 --> 00:37:14,828
I would have.

668
00:37:14,871 --> 00:37:19,541
There was something in that file
he didn't want anybody to see.

669
00:37:19,581 --> 00:37:21,175
Exactly.

670
00:37:21,218 --> 00:37:24,555
We have one last chance...
to find the person

671
00:37:24,592 --> 00:37:26,494
who wrote that file
in the first place.

672
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:28,124
How do you ever hope
to find him?

673
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:30,069
Her.

674
00:37:30,104 --> 00:37:31,869
Her?
How do you know?

675
00:37:31,941 --> 00:37:34,538
Because I've already
found her name... Jomat Luson.

676
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,894
Do you remember anything
from back then, Rugal?

677
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:44,992
No.

678
00:37:45,037 --> 00:37:47,770
Do you remember being adopted?

679
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:49,608
No.

680
00:37:52,286 --> 00:37:55,521
What's the first thing
you do remember?

681
00:37:57,731 --> 00:38:00,601
My father teaching me
how to swim.

682
00:38:03,944 --> 00:38:07,145
I know exactly the one
you're talking about.

683
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:08,518
You do?

684
00:38:08,555 --> 00:38:11,858
He was the only Cardassian boy
we had at the time.

685
00:38:11,896 --> 00:38:13,229
We had several girls.

686
00:38:13,266 --> 00:38:15,236
Are you sure his name was Rugal?

687
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,864
That's what we were told.

688
00:38:16,907 --> 00:38:18,570
Somebody told you his name?

689
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,877
Yes, that was
the most unusual thing

690
00:38:20,916 --> 00:38:22,715
about his arrival.

691
00:38:22,753 --> 00:38:26,056
Virtually all of the other
Cardassian children

692
00:38:26,094 --> 00:38:29,933
turned in to us were found
on the streets by Bajorans.

693
00:38:30,036 --> 00:38:32,667
Rugal was brought in
by a Cardassian.

694
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:35,578
A Cardassian military
officer, by any chance?

695
00:38:35,614 --> 00:38:37,447
Yes, as a matter of fact,
she was.

696
00:38:37,486 --> 00:38:38,750
A woman.

697
00:38:38,788 --> 00:38:43,822
I don't remember her name,
but she was attached

698
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:46,633
to the command post
at Terok Nor.

699
00:38:46,672 --> 00:38:49,337
Is there anything else, Doctor?

700
00:38:52,652 --> 00:38:56,423
The boy accused him
of being a butcher.

701
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,954
He hates Cardassians, sir.

702
00:38:58,999 --> 00:39:00,628
Pa'Dar was heartbroken.

703
00:39:00,669 --> 00:39:03,642
I can only imagine
how I'd feel in his shoes.

704
00:39:07,184 --> 00:39:08,483
Commander...

705
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,253
can I ask a few questions?

706
00:39:20,529 --> 00:39:22,898
Chief, didn't Pa'Dar tell you

707
00:39:22,934 --> 00:39:26,169
about the humiliation
he feels right now?

708
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,041
He said he had disgraced

709
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,573
everything a Cardassian
believes in.

710
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,645
Has news of your son's discovery

711
00:39:32,689 --> 00:39:35,092
become public knowledge
on Cardassia?

712
00:39:35,128 --> 00:39:38,967
The government has not chosen
to reveal it to the people yet.

713
00:39:39,003 --> 00:39:41,099
What happens
when it is revealed?

714
00:39:41,141 --> 00:39:44,444
It will be the end
of my political career.

715
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:46,280
That's a shame...

716
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:48,722
especially
considering the timing.

717
00:39:48,758 --> 00:39:50,057
The timing?

718
00:39:50,094 --> 00:39:52,463
Isn't there an inquiry
about to begin

719
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,767
concerning the Cardassians
who were involved

720
00:39:54,804 --> 00:39:57,401
in the attempted
military coup on Bajor?

721
00:39:57,443 --> 00:39:59,470
Yes.

722
00:39:59,548 --> 00:40:03,147
And isn't Gul Dukat one of
the key witness in that inquiry?

723
00:40:03,189 --> 00:40:05,285
This is irrelevant
and insulting.

724
00:40:05,328 --> 00:40:07,629
Commander,
you've lost control here.

725
00:40:07,666 --> 00:40:10,433
Yes, it seems that I have.

726
00:40:10,472 --> 00:40:13,639
I suggest we return to the issue
of the children.

727
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:14,978
All right.

728
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:17,746
Let's talk about children.

729
00:40:17,788 --> 00:40:18,756
Have you ever been

730
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,521
to the Tozhat Resettlement
Center on Bajor

731
00:40:20,561 --> 00:40:21,654
where Rugal was adopted?

732
00:40:21,697 --> 00:40:22,756
Never.

733
00:40:22,799 --> 00:40:23,824
Of course.

734
00:40:23,868 --> 00:40:25,964
Tozhat is the province
where Pa'Dar

735
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,943
was stationed eight years ago.

736
00:40:27,977 --> 00:40:29,503
I'm aware of that.

737
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:36,559
I've been trying to find records
of Rugal's adoption

738
00:40:36,629 --> 00:40:38,896
but they're missing
from the files.

739
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:41,530
How unfortunate.

740
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:44,944
Yes, but we have found someone
who was working at the Center

741
00:40:44,981 --> 00:40:47,042
at the time Rugal
was brought in.

742
00:40:47,086 --> 00:40:49,751
Do you know of a Bajoran
social volunteer

743
00:40:49,792 --> 00:40:51,455
named Jomat Luson?

744
00:40:51,495 --> 00:40:52,828
No.

745
00:40:52,865 --> 00:40:56,066
Well, Jomat Luson remembers
Rugal being brought in

746
00:40:56,106 --> 00:40:58,202
by a Cardassian military officer

747
00:40:58,243 --> 00:41:02,048
a woman who seemed familiar
with him... even knew his name.

748
00:41:03,956 --> 00:41:05,653
Is there a question?

749
00:41:05,693 --> 00:41:08,529
The question is whether
or not this officer

750
00:41:08,567 --> 00:41:11,266
deliberately left the son
of Kotran Pa'Dar

751
00:41:11,306 --> 00:41:13,208
at the relocation center

752
00:41:13,243 --> 00:41:15,874
with the full knowledge
that he was not an orphan.

753
00:41:15,916 --> 00:41:20,324
Perhaps even with the hopes
of humiliating Pa'Dar someday.

754
00:41:22,497 --> 00:41:23,830
I wouldn't know.

755
00:41:23,867 --> 00:41:27,136
Well, would you happen
to know, then, of a base

756
00:41:27,174 --> 00:41:30,044
known during the occupation
as Terok Nor?

757
00:41:30,081 --> 00:41:32,416
Terok Nor?

758
00:41:32,452 --> 00:41:35,185
It was here, this space station.

759
00:41:36,896 --> 00:41:38,889
Jomat Luson clearly recalls

760
00:41:38,933 --> 00:41:41,632
that the officer
who brought in Rugal

761
00:41:41,672 --> 00:41:43,939
was attached to Terok Nor.

762
00:41:52,229 --> 00:41:53,892
Gul Dukat!

763
00:41:53,933 --> 00:41:57,498
Who was the commanding officer
of Terok Nor eight years ago?

764
00:42:06,127 --> 00:42:07,824
For the record

765
00:42:07,864 --> 00:42:11,167
the commanding officer
of Terok Nor eight years ago

766
00:42:11,204 --> 00:42:12,764
was Gul Dukat.

767
00:42:16,516 --> 00:42:21,653
Station Log, Stardate 47178.3.

768
00:42:21,727 --> 00:42:23,925
After long and difficult
deliberations

769
00:42:23,965 --> 00:42:25,525
I have decided to allow Pa'Dar

770
00:42:25,569 --> 00:42:27,402
to take his son
back to Cardassia.

771
00:42:27,439 --> 00:42:30,240
Although I am convinced
his Bajoran foster parents

772
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,509
treated him with love

773
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,579
Rugal has been the clear victim
in this conspiracy.

774
00:42:34,622 --> 00:42:38,255
I believe it's time
for his healing to begin.

775
00:42:39,366 --> 00:42:42,862
Your doctor has given me
the leverage I need, Commander.

776
00:42:42,907 --> 00:42:44,136
Leverage?

777
00:42:44,176 --> 00:42:46,112
Dukat will never
allow these events

778
00:42:46,148 --> 00:42:47,343
to be made public now

779
00:42:47,383 --> 00:42:49,718
and I certainly won't
choose to discuss them.

780
00:42:49,755 --> 00:42:52,022
- A stalemate.
- A stalemate.

781
00:42:52,061 --> 00:42:54,624
You've helped me salvage
my political career.

782
00:42:54,666 --> 00:42:55,827
I won't forget that.

783
00:42:55,868 --> 00:42:57,667
Perhaps you will
use your influence

784
00:42:57,707 --> 00:42:59,905
to help other Cardassian
orphans on Bajor.

785
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:03,145
Well, yes, we'll see.

786
00:43:03,185 --> 00:43:04,380
Remember what I said.

787
00:43:04,421 --> 00:43:07,553
If you ever want to come
back and visit them

788
00:43:07,594 --> 00:43:10,361
just let me know
and I'll arrange it.

789
00:43:11,436 --> 00:43:14,101
Hello, Rugal.
Ready to go?

790
00:43:21,258 --> 00:43:23,354
I suppose it'll take time.

791
00:43:39,498 --> 00:43:43,769
But there's one more question
I haven't figured out, Garak.

792
00:43:43,808 --> 00:43:46,245
Why did you want
to expose Dukat?

793
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,774
What's the truth
about you and him?

794
00:43:48,852 --> 00:43:52,019
Truth, Doctor, is in
the eye of the beholder.

795
00:43:52,059 --> 00:43:53,926
I never tell the truth

796
00:43:53,963 --> 00:43:57,232
because I don't believe
there is such a thing.

797
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:00,300
That's why I prefer
the straight-line simplicity

798
00:44:00,344 --> 00:44:01,973
of cutting cloth.

799
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,984
So you're not going to tell me.

800
00:44:04,018 --> 00:44:06,922
But you don't need me
to tell you, my friend.

801
00:44:06,959 --> 00:44:09,020
Just notice the details.

802
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,124
They're scattered like crumbs

803
00:44:11,168 --> 00:44:14,072
all over this table
we regularly share.

804
00:44:15,243 --> 00:44:16,872
Until next time.
