1
00:00:09,521 --> 00:00:11,014
Not now! Look!

2
00:00:11,862 --> 00:00:14,097
Dabo!

3
00:00:21,727 --> 00:00:24,395
Dabo!

4
00:00:32,294 --> 00:00:33,388
Dabo!

5
00:00:37,108 --> 00:00:38,841
You aren't leaving?

6
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:40,351
Well...

7
00:00:40,386 --> 00:00:43,726
Come on, aren't
you feeling lucky?

8
00:00:43,763 --> 00:00:46,259
All right then, one more time.

9
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:47,433
Let it ride.

10
00:00:53,361 --> 00:00:54,831
Oh...

11
00:00:54,865 --> 00:00:57,236
<i>karjinko.</i>

12
00:00:57,274 --> 00:00:59,075
Sorry.

13
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:06,532
Uh, wait a minute there.

14
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,371
My name is Okalar.

15
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:09,709
What's yours?

16
00:01:09,746 --> 00:01:11,273
Busy.

17
00:01:22,722 --> 00:01:24,854
You are evil.

18
00:01:24,894 --> 00:01:26,194
Who? Me?

19
00:01:26,232 --> 00:01:28,934
He was going
to walk away a winner.

20
00:01:28,974 --> 00:01:30,570
First rule of dabo is...

21
00:01:30,613 --> 00:01:33,885
...Watch the wheel,
not the girl.

22
00:01:33,923 --> 00:01:37,697
So, what's on the menu
tomorrow night?

23
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:40,073
Tomorrow night?

24
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,580
Dinner with your father.

25
00:01:41,615 --> 00:01:42,778
What?

26
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:44,187
He didn't tell you?

27
00:01:44,223 --> 00:01:45,591
He came by this afternoon

28
00:01:45,628 --> 00:01:47,794
and invited me to dinner
tomorrow night.

29
00:01:47,835 --> 00:01:49,807
In fact, he said
it was your idea.

30
00:01:49,841 --> 00:01:51,277
My idea?

31
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:56,116
Oh, I, I, I guess I might
have mentioned something

32
00:01:56,161 --> 00:01:57,962
about having you over.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,665
I, I thought he forgot.

34
00:01:59,706 --> 00:02:02,476
It is all right, isn't it?

35
00:02:02,515 --> 00:02:06,050
I mean, you don't mind, do you?

36
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:10,266
Oh, no.
No, of course not.

37
00:02:11,276 --> 00:02:13,305
It'll be great.

38
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,049
You're going to love
my dad's cooking.

39
00:02:26,993 --> 00:02:28,658
This is a surprise.

40
00:02:28,698 --> 00:02:30,693
A pleasant one, I hope.

41
00:02:30,738 --> 00:02:32,299
So do I.

42
00:02:32,343 --> 00:02:36,014
I have some salvage for you,
Quark.

43
00:02:38,697 --> 00:02:41,638
This isn't a good time to be
selling your kind of salvage.

44
00:02:41,673 --> 00:02:44,273
No, no, no,
it's perfectly legal.

45
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:47,314
I mean, it's really
salvage this time.

46
00:02:47,358 --> 00:02:49,729
I'm not looking
for junk right now

47
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:51,327
but...

48
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:55,316
I'm more in the market
for entertainment.

49
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,485
I think you'll like this junk,
Quark.

50
00:02:58,527 --> 00:03:01,867
It's a wreckage
from a ship that crashed

51
00:03:01,904 --> 00:03:03,169
in the Gamma Quadrant.

52
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,203
You're still going
to the Gamma Quadrant?

53
00:03:05,249 --> 00:03:06,240
Mm-hmm.

54
00:03:07,523 --> 00:03:10,430
I love bold women.
How much?

55
00:03:10,465 --> 00:03:13,269
Three bars of latinum
and you can have it all.

56
00:03:13,307 --> 00:03:14,538
What kind of ship is it?

57
00:03:14,578 --> 00:03:15,741
I don't know.

58
00:03:15,782 --> 00:03:16,808
Can I see it first?

59
00:03:16,852 --> 00:03:18,117
There's no time.

60
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,558
Oh...

61
00:03:19,627 --> 00:03:25,579
Quark, you and I have been
doing business for years.

62
00:03:25,646 --> 00:03:27,949
Don't you trust me?

63
00:03:59,857 --> 00:04:03,061
Three bars of latinum?

64
00:04:04,638 --> 00:04:05,664
It was worth it.

65
00:04:19,553 --> 00:04:21,582
No.

66
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:46,294
No.

67
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:49,645
No.

68
00:04:52,357 --> 00:04:54,489
No.

69
00:06:56,786 --> 00:06:58,986
You bought a child?

70
00:06:59,026 --> 00:07:01,592
I just thought that I was
buying some wreckage.

71
00:07:01,635 --> 00:07:04,337
How was I supposed to know
there was a baby in there?

72
00:07:04,377 --> 00:07:05,870
Maybe you should
inspect the merchandise

73
00:07:05,915 --> 00:07:06,906
before you make the deal

74
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:09,653
or isn't there a Rule
of Acquisition for that?

75
00:07:09,693 --> 00:07:12,395
There is and I do, usually.

76
00:07:12,435 --> 00:07:14,202
We haven't been able
to trace the Boslic captain

77
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,368
since she left the station.

78
00:07:15,412 --> 00:07:18,046
Her flight plan said
she was headed for Risa

79
00:07:18,087 --> 00:07:20,526
but I don't think we should
put much faith in that.

80
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:22,933
Well, I haven't been able
to identify his species

81
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:24,234
but he seems to be healthy.

82
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,366
Seems?

83
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,007
For a humanoid, he has

84
00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:28,987
an incredibly fast
metabolic rate.

85
00:07:29,022 --> 00:07:31,257
The cells in his body
are dividing at a pace

86
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:33,358
I haven't seen
outside of a laboratory.

87
00:07:33,402 --> 00:07:35,374
But, since there are no thyroid
or hypothalmic problems

88
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:37,244
I assume that this
is only natural

89
00:07:37,282 --> 00:07:38,775
for someone of his species

90
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,290
but I would like him here
for further tests.

91
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,624
Very well.

92
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:45,299
What do we know about the ship
the boy was on?

93
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:48,317
Chief O'Brien just started
to analyze the wreckage.

94
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,843
We should have
a preliminary report

95
00:07:49,888 --> 00:07:51,119
in a couple of hours.

96
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,128
Ah, uh, now wait a minute.

97
00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:54,762
I paid good money
for that wreckage and...

98
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,808
and now it's yours.

99
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,051
Enjoy.

100
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,491
Hmm.

101
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:15,764
Hi there.

102
00:08:19,216 --> 00:08:20,242
We should contact

103
00:08:20,285 --> 00:08:23,352
one of the orphanages
on Bajor and let them know

104
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:25,731
we might have someone for them.

105
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,708
Hmm?

106
00:08:27,743 --> 00:08:31,151
I was talking
about an orphanage.

107
00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:33,753
Oh, right.

108
00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:37,604
Have Major Kira make
the appropriate arrangements.

109
00:08:39,614 --> 00:08:43,821
Will you keep me informed
about him?

110
00:08:46,938 --> 00:08:49,411
Yes, sir.

111
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:57,467
What?

112
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,408
You are positively glowing.

113
00:08:59,444 --> 00:09:00,744
Oh, come on.

114
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:02,719
I haven't seen that look
on your face since...

115
00:09:02,754 --> 00:09:05,227
Since Jake stopped
wearing diapers.

116
00:09:06,734 --> 00:09:10,405
I never thought
I'd hear myself saying this

117
00:09:10,445 --> 00:09:14,754
but I miss taking care of Jake
when he was a baby.

118
00:09:14,793 --> 00:09:18,635
I miss holding him,
singing to him at night

119
00:09:18,672 --> 00:09:19,972
feeding him.

120
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:23,475
Listening to him cry,
changing his diapers

121
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,687
worrying when he was sick.

122
00:09:25,728 --> 00:09:27,359
I haven't forgotten.

123
00:09:29,606 --> 00:09:31,099
But there are times

124
00:09:31,145 --> 00:09:33,779
when I would give
almost anything

125
00:09:33,821 --> 00:09:37,093
for the days when I
could make Jake happy

126
00:09:37,131 --> 00:09:39,867
just by lifting him
over my head.

127
00:09:39,906 --> 00:09:41,171
Good night.

128
00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:01,737
Hey, how about a hug
for the old man?

129
00:10:06,124 --> 00:10:07,594
Why didn't you tell me

130
00:10:07,628 --> 00:10:10,501
you were going to invite
Mardah to dinner?

131
00:10:10,537 --> 00:10:12,475
Well, I did, weeks ago.

132
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:15,977
I told you if you
didn't invite her soon

133
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:18,016
I'd invite her myself.

134
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,705
I, I still wish you'd given me
a little more warning.

135
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,286
Well, I didn't realize

136
00:10:26,321 --> 00:10:29,627
that a dinner invitation
required so much warning.

137
00:10:29,665 --> 00:10:33,701
It doesn't, and it's not
a problem or anything.

138
00:10:33,745 --> 00:10:36,276
It just caught me by surprise.

139
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,193
Well, dinner isn't
until tomorrow night.

140
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:42,296
That'll give you
a full day to prepare her

141
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:46,979
for the traumatic experience of
having dinner with the old man.

142
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,080
Yeah.

143
00:10:48,124 --> 00:10:50,290
Uh, I mean, there's
nothing to prepare for.

144
00:10:50,332 --> 00:10:51,563
It's just dinner.

145
00:10:51,602 --> 00:10:52,902
Exactly.

146
00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:55,972
- Right.
- Right.

147
00:10:57,019 --> 00:10:58,615
All right.

148
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,724
You wanted to see me, Doctor?

149
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,858
Yes, it's about our new visitor.

150
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,895
Is something wrong
with the baby?

151
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,641
No, but he's not a baby anymore.

152
00:11:30,012 --> 00:11:32,714
There are a great many species
with what we would call

153
00:11:32,754 --> 00:11:35,753
accelerated growth rates,
but they're usually

154
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:38,532
small, physiologically
simple creatures.

155
00:11:38,571 --> 00:11:42,015
I've never seen such
a rapid maturation process

156
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,751
in anything as complex
as a humanoid.

157
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:47,768
He looks about eight
or nine years old.

158
00:11:47,802 --> 00:11:50,436
But how old is he in reality?

159
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52,780
Well, judging by his
cellular kinetic profile

160
00:11:52,818 --> 00:11:55,725
I'd say he's no more
than two weeks of age.

161
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,820
Who are you?

162
00:12:02,348 --> 00:12:05,620
I'm Benjamin and that's Julian.

163
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,722
Do you have a name?

164
00:12:07,765 --> 00:12:10,000
I need food.

165
00:12:11,477 --> 00:12:14,350
With your kind of metabolism,
I'm not surprised.

166
00:12:14,386 --> 00:12:16,791
I'll get you something
in a few minutes.

167
00:12:16,827 --> 00:12:17,887
Where am I?

168
00:12:17,931 --> 00:12:19,869
On a space station.

169
00:12:19,904 --> 00:12:21,739
Do you know what that is?

170
00:12:21,776 --> 00:12:23,680
No.

171
00:12:23,716 --> 00:12:25,848
But I want to learn.

172
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:31,567
I'd say we have a lot
to learn from each other.

173
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:35,114
Um...

174
00:12:35,153 --> 00:12:37,684
I'll be right back.

175
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,651
Advanced language skills.

176
00:12:45,686 --> 00:12:47,054
And cognitive reasoning.

177
00:12:47,091 --> 00:12:48,561
He didn't just pick those up

178
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:50,362
by sitting there
listening to us.

179
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:52,567
This is either a natural
ability in his species

180
00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:54,169
or some kind
of basic intelligence

181
00:12:54,214 --> 00:12:55,947
implanted into his
genetic structure.

182
00:12:55,985 --> 00:12:57,923
Implanted?
You mean artificially?

183
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,364
Yes, and I tend to discount
the possibility

184
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,996
that it is a natural ability.

185
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:03,635
His biomolecular
diffusion gradient

186
00:13:03,677 --> 00:13:05,741
all ready suggests that
his cellular mitosis

187
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,254
has been artificially
enhanced.

188
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:09,819
So, you're saying
he may have been part

189
00:13:09,863 --> 00:13:11,060
of some experiment?

190
00:13:11,101 --> 00:13:13,165
Possibly.
If so, he's an example

191
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:15,875
of some very advanced
genetic engineering.

192
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,355
His cognitive abilities
are developing

193
00:13:18,391 --> 00:13:20,192
without any external stimuli.

194
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,761
I want you to test
his mental abilities.

195
00:13:22,804 --> 00:13:24,104
See if they increase.

196
00:13:24,142 --> 00:13:27,482
Maybe he'll get to the point
where he can tell us who he is

197
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,253
and where he's come from.

198
00:13:34,777 --> 00:13:37,445
This is where Quark
said he found the boy.

199
00:13:37,485 --> 00:13:40,153
It seems to be some
kind of stasis chamber

200
00:13:40,193 --> 00:13:41,892
that was damaged in the crash.

201
00:13:41,932 --> 00:13:44,064
That could imply
they didn't want him

202
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:46,010
to begin maturing
while he was on board.

203
00:13:46,045 --> 00:13:48,109
What about the rest
of the wreckage?

204
00:13:48,152 --> 00:13:49,212
It seems to indicate

205
00:13:49,255 --> 00:13:52,094
this was some kind of freighter
or transport vessel.

206
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:55,039
Did you find any computers
or other information systems?

207
00:13:55,074 --> 00:13:56,305
No, not yet.

208
00:13:56,345 --> 00:13:58,214
Most of it's just junk...

209
00:13:58,251 --> 00:14:00,588
twisted bulkheads,
burnt deck plating

210
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,616
that sort of thing.

211
00:14:01,662 --> 00:14:03,634
We should have a full inventory
by tomorrow morning.

212
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:04,694
Good.

213
00:14:04,738 --> 00:14:06,767
By the way, the replicators

214
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,788
in my quarters are
on the blink again.

215
00:14:09,822 --> 00:14:12,558
Could you spare someone
this afternoon to fix them?

216
00:14:12,597 --> 00:14:13,588
Oh, that's right.

217
00:14:13,634 --> 00:14:15,629
Tonight's the big dinner
with Mardah.

218
00:14:15,673 --> 00:14:16,733
You know about that?

219
00:14:16,777 --> 00:14:18,749
Well, Jake mentioned it
this morning.

220
00:14:18,783 --> 00:14:21,314
In fact, I'd say it's
the only thing on his mind.

221
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:23,728
You would think I was going
to court-martial her

222
00:14:23,766 --> 00:14:25,236
by the way he's acting.

223
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,901
Well, I guess it's only natural.

224
00:14:26,943 --> 00:14:28,744
Bringing a girl home
for the first time

225
00:14:28,782 --> 00:14:30,343
is a pretty traumatic
experience.

226
00:14:30,387 --> 00:14:34,925
Quark may call her a dabo girl,
but she's 20 years old.

227
00:14:34,969 --> 00:14:36,530
She's a woman.

228
00:14:36,573 --> 00:14:37,941
And Jake is a 16-year-old boy.

229
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:39,278
It has to stop.

230
00:14:39,315 --> 00:14:41,014
Well, why did you
invite her over?

231
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:42,787
If you don't mind my asking.

232
00:14:42,827 --> 00:14:43,955
Curiosity mostly.

233
00:14:43,998 --> 00:14:45,833
I wanted to see
what I was up against.

234
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,934
What if it turns out
you like her?

235
00:14:47,976 --> 00:14:51,853
She's a dabo girl.
She's dating my son.

236
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:54,455
I don't want to like her.

237
00:15:00,885 --> 00:15:05,092
16 years old
and dating a dabo girl.

238
00:15:05,131 --> 00:15:07,229
Godspeed, Jake.

239
00:15:22,219 --> 00:15:23,621
Major.

240
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:25,458
Odo.

241
00:15:25,563 --> 00:15:27,592
For you.

242
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,129
Ah.

243
00:15:30,445 --> 00:15:31,881
Let me guess...

244
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:35,361
uh, decoration
for my new quarters.

245
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:37,925
Just a little something
to brighten your room.

246
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:42,974
That's, uh, very...
thoughtful of you.

247
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:44,546
You're welcome.

248
00:15:48,035 --> 00:15:51,638
I suppose you'd like
to see my new quarters.

249
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,447
Everyone wants
to see your quarters.

250
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,389
It's called curiosity.

251
00:15:55,425 --> 00:15:57,921
Ah.

252
00:16:14,185 --> 00:16:16,853
It's not really finished yet.

253
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,728
This is just the start.

254
00:16:18,767 --> 00:16:20,500
The start of what?

255
00:16:22,645 --> 00:16:24,446
I want to make this room

256
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,923
into a place
where I can explore

257
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,164
what it truly means
to be a shape-shifter.

258
00:16:30,203 --> 00:16:33,543
I thought it had to be
something like that.

259
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,849
I mean, you don't exactly need

260
00:16:35,887 --> 00:16:39,889
an entire set of quarters
just to sit in your bucket.

261
00:16:39,934 --> 00:16:42,636
I don't use
the bucket anymore.

262
00:16:42,676 --> 00:16:46,781
I've kept it to remind
me of how I used to be.

263
00:16:49,531 --> 00:16:52,632
But now, when I need
to regenerate

264
00:16:52,674 --> 00:16:58,318
I simply revert to my gelatinous
state anywhere in this room.

265
00:16:58,359 --> 00:17:03,467
Here, I can experiment with
different shapes, textures.

266
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:07,214
I can bring
in various forms to emulate.

267
00:17:07,254 --> 00:17:09,854
And I can do it in private.

268
00:17:11,902 --> 00:17:14,239
I'm sorry if I intruded.

269
00:17:14,276 --> 00:17:16,340
Maybe I should leave.

270
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:18,218
No, please.

271
00:17:19,226 --> 00:17:21,392
You're always welcome here,
Major.

272
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:26,478
Well...

273
00:17:28,321 --> 00:17:30,726
where should we put it?

274
00:17:30,763 --> 00:17:31,789
Ah!

275
00:17:46,781 --> 00:17:48,251
Perfect.

276
00:18:00,219 --> 00:18:03,663
The boy's DNA sequence
has definitely been altered.

277
00:18:03,697 --> 00:18:06,034
The nucleotide analysis
proves that conclusively.

278
00:18:06,071 --> 00:18:08,773
So he's a product
of genetic engineering.

279
00:18:08,813 --> 00:18:09,873
But why?

280
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:11,684
Was he a unique experiment

281
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:14,858
or is this sort of thing
common in his species?

282
00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:16,199
There's more.

283
00:18:16,236 --> 00:18:17,296
His blood chemistry

284
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,643
shows that he's missing
a key isogenic enzyme

285
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,516
and without large
quantities of it

286
00:18:21,554 --> 00:18:23,993
his circulatory system
would simply shut down.

287
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:25,590
Can you replicate this enzyme?

288
00:18:25,633 --> 00:18:27,103
I've been trying, and
I think I've come up

289
00:18:27,138 --> 00:18:28,129
with a temporary substitute.

290
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:29,235
But what I don't understand is

291
00:18:29,345 --> 00:18:31,477
why anybody would want to
genetically engineer someone

292
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:32,545
with such an obvious flaw.

293
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:34,390
Nurse Hortak to Dr. Bashir.

294
00:18:34,428 --> 00:18:36,994
You're needed in
the Infirmary immediately.

295
00:18:37,036 --> 00:18:39,008
On my way.

296
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:48,871
Listen, it's all right.

297
00:18:48,908 --> 00:18:50,880
No one's going to hurt you.

298
00:18:50,915 --> 00:18:52,408
Let's just go back
inside and, and...

299
00:18:55,462 --> 00:18:57,560
Security to Promenade!

300
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:02,608
Stop!
Stay where you are!

301
00:19:16,897 --> 00:19:17,991
Dax to Sisko.

302
00:19:18,034 --> 00:19:19,334
Go ahead.

303
00:19:19,372 --> 00:19:23,647
I think we've solved the mystery
of our young visitor, Benjamin.

304
00:19:23,685 --> 00:19:25,155
He's a Jem'Hadar.

305
00:19:33,684 --> 00:19:36,180
I've just spoken
with Starfleet Command.

306
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:39,395
They want to make sure
he's healthy enough to travel

307
00:19:39,436 --> 00:19:41,500
and then send him
to Starbase 201

308
00:19:41,543 --> 00:19:44,177
where he'll be handed over
to a team of specialists.

309
00:19:44,218 --> 00:19:45,312
Sounds good to me.

310
00:19:45,355 --> 00:19:46,518
The sooner, the better.

311
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,865
What sort of specialists
are we talking about, Commander?

312
00:19:49,902 --> 00:19:52,604
There will be a complete
team of xenobiologists

313
00:19:52,644 --> 00:19:54,947
and exopsychologists
waiting for him.

314
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:59,933
So they're going to study him
like a laboratory specimen.

315
00:19:59,968 --> 00:20:01,461
Well, he'll be
very well treated.

316
00:20:01,573 --> 00:20:05,017
So he'll be
a well-treated specimen.

317
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,646
I have to agree
with Odo, Commander.

318
00:20:06,689 --> 00:20:08,388
We can't just ship him off

319
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:10,264
like some biological
sample that we've found.

320
00:20:10,301 --> 00:20:12,000
He's a sentient life form.

321
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,104
True, but the Founders
could have removed

322
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,343
his sense of free will.

323
00:20:15,384 --> 00:20:16,877
He may be nothing more

324
00:20:16,922 --> 00:20:20,023
than a genetically
programmed killing machine.

325
00:20:20,065 --> 00:20:21,125
I agree, and we don't want

326
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:22,868
one of them walking
around this station.

327
00:20:22,907 --> 00:20:24,070
Fine!

328
00:20:24,111 --> 00:20:26,516
If you want answers
about the Jem'Hadar

329
00:20:26,552 --> 00:20:29,152
I'm the one
who can find them for you.

330
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:30,790
Let me get to know him.

331
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:34,470
I'll be responsible
for his conduct while he's here.

332
00:20:36,284 --> 00:20:39,351
Odo, do you really think
you can control him?

333
00:20:39,394 --> 00:20:42,598
He's already shown
a certain deference to me.

334
00:20:42,704 --> 00:20:46,512
That's probably another
genetic alteration implanted

335
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:50,221
by the Founders to ensure
the Jem'Hadar's loyalty.

336
00:20:50,262 --> 00:20:52,793
I can keep him
from harming anyone.

337
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:55,869
I'd like to speak with
the Constable in private

338
00:20:55,913 --> 00:20:57,349
for a moment, please.

339
00:21:05,477 --> 00:21:06,605
Talk to me, Odo.

340
00:21:06,648 --> 00:21:09,988
Tell me what's
really going on here.

341
00:21:10,025 --> 00:21:12,260
What the Founders
did to the boy...

342
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:15,298
to all the Jem'Hadar...
is not your fault.

343
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:17,246
Maybe not.

344
00:21:17,281 --> 00:21:21,751
But I feel an obligation
to undo some of the damage

345
00:21:21,796 --> 00:21:24,498
that my race
has done to this boy.

346
00:21:24,538 --> 00:21:26,510
And I also know what it's like

347
00:21:26,544 --> 00:21:28,243
to be a specimen
in a laboratory.

348
00:21:28,283 --> 00:21:30,449
Oh, I'm sure
they'll treat him very well.

349
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,796
No one will risk
harming their new prize.

350
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,000
They'll be courteous, caring

351
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,910
treat him
like he's among friends

352
00:21:37,947 --> 00:21:41,253
but, in the end, he'll be
just another specimen to them...

353
00:21:41,292 --> 00:21:44,393
something to be analyzed
and cataloged.

354
00:21:44,434 --> 00:21:45,870
Give me the chance to find out

355
00:21:45,906 --> 00:21:50,215
if he really is just
a programmed killing machine

356
00:21:50,253 --> 00:21:54,666
or if we can help him
become something else.

357
00:21:57,243 --> 00:21:59,272
I'll tell Starfleet

358
00:21:59,315 --> 00:22:02,450
we have some preliminary tests

359
00:22:02,492 --> 00:22:05,559
to run before we send
him to Starbase 201.

360
00:22:05,602 --> 00:22:07,163
Thank you, Commander.

361
00:22:07,207 --> 00:22:11,118
Just... be careful, Odo.

362
00:22:11,153 --> 00:22:14,220
He is still a Jem'Hadar.

363
00:22:27,606 --> 00:22:28,940
Listen to me!

364
00:22:28,977 --> 00:22:30,778
I'm trying to help.

365
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,153
Your body is craving
a certain chemical compound.

366
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,821
That is why
you're feeling anxious

367
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:36,093
and having muscle spasms.

368
00:22:36,133 --> 00:22:37,398
There's nothing wrong with me.

369
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:42,814
Yes, there is, and denying it
won't make it go away.

370
00:22:42,855 --> 00:22:44,223
Leave me alone!

371
00:22:47,336 --> 00:22:49,639
You can wait outside.

372
00:22:50,846 --> 00:22:55,316
I think everything
is under control now.

373
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,900
Please...

374
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:01,742
sit down.

375
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:10,875
You don't look well.

376
00:23:10,944 --> 00:23:12,414
How do you feel?

377
00:23:12,449 --> 00:23:14,421
Something's wrong with me.

378
00:23:14,455 --> 00:23:18,366
I feel sick when I eat.

379
00:23:18,402 --> 00:23:20,898
I have pains in my head...

380
00:23:20,976 --> 00:23:22,641
in my chest.

381
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:24,813
His body's addicted
to a specific isogenic enzyme.

382
00:23:24,855 --> 00:23:27,659
Right now, he's experiencing
all the symptoms of withdrawal.

383
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:28,666
Addicted?

384
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,669
That's right.

385
00:23:29,704 --> 00:23:31,676
Can you replicate this enzyme?

386
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,115
I've had some success
with triglycerides

387
00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:35,451
but they're just
a stopgap measure.

388
00:23:35,489 --> 00:23:37,894
I can't get an exact
chemical formula

389
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:39,265
without doing further tests

390
00:23:39,302 --> 00:23:41,605
but he's shown certain
resistance to that idea.

391
00:23:41,642 --> 00:23:43,477
I don't want any more tests.

392
00:23:43,515 --> 00:23:45,487
Dr. Bashir is
trying to help you.

393
00:23:45,521 --> 00:23:46,718
You should let him.

394
00:23:49,032 --> 00:23:51,198
You may run your tests.

395
00:23:57,827 --> 00:23:59,993
My name is Odo.

396
00:24:00,034 --> 00:24:01,665
I don't have a name.

397
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:04,841
When your tests are done,
I can get you out of here

398
00:24:04,883 --> 00:24:06,718
maybe show you
around the station.

399
00:24:06,756 --> 00:24:08,226
If you wish.

400
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,730
What do you want?

401
00:24:09,765 --> 00:24:12,501
Do you have any needs
or desires of your own?

402
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:14,011
I want to fight!

403
00:24:14,046 --> 00:24:15,516
Who, me?

404
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,678
No.

405
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:17,690
The others.

406
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:19,194
Why?

407
00:24:19,229 --> 00:24:22,033
I don't know, but that's
what I want to do.

408
00:24:22,071 --> 00:24:23,872
Is that wrong?

409
00:24:23,911 --> 00:24:25,610
Well, let's just say,
we need to find

410
00:24:25,649 --> 00:24:27,210
other interests
for you to pursue.

411
00:24:27,255 --> 00:24:30,994
For the moment,
why don't you relax?

412
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:33,529
Try not to be so tense.

413
00:24:33,575 --> 00:24:35,878
Take it easy.

414
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:38,719
Smile.

415
00:24:38,758 --> 00:24:40,251
A smile.

416
00:24:40,297 --> 00:24:41,767
You know...

417
00:24:49,391 --> 00:24:52,230
Well, we'll work on that.

418
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:14,410
Smells good.
What is it?

419
00:25:14,453 --> 00:25:18,626
Ah, shrimp Creole
with Mandalay sauce...

420
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:19,727
one of my father's recipes.

421
00:25:19,771 --> 00:25:20,899
You're going to love this.

422
00:25:20,941 --> 00:25:22,845
I hope you like spicy food.

423
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:24,580
This sure has a bite.

424
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:33,213
So, Mardah, tell me
a little about yourself.

425
00:25:33,247 --> 00:25:35,185
What do you want to know?

426
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,352
Oh, anything.

427
00:25:37,394 --> 00:25:40,233
Family.

428
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:42,264
There isn't much to tell.

429
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,579
It's a pretty familiar story.

430
00:25:44,617 --> 00:25:47,353
Parents killed
during the occupation.

431
00:25:47,392 --> 00:25:50,800
Raised by my neighbors
until I was 13.

432
00:25:50,836 --> 00:25:52,705
Then I moved out on my own.

433
00:25:52,743 --> 00:25:55,411
I have a sister
and a brother on Bajor

434
00:25:55,451 --> 00:25:57,720
but we haven't talked in years.

435
00:25:59,096 --> 00:26:00,498
Why not?

436
00:26:00,535 --> 00:26:03,031
Sarjeno and Koran
were not exactly thrilled

437
00:26:03,075 --> 00:26:05,675
when I told them I had a job
as a dabo girl.

438
00:26:05,717 --> 00:26:08,020
Then I told them what I thought

439
00:26:08,058 --> 00:26:12,197
of their lives,
and we stopped speaking.

440
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,575
I see.

441
00:26:14,613 --> 00:26:16,848
It's amazing
how some people will judge you

442
00:26:16,887 --> 00:26:18,825
based on nothing more
than your job.

443
00:26:25,548 --> 00:26:28,079
Did I mention that Mardah's
quite a writer?

444
00:26:28,122 --> 00:26:29,592
Uh, really?

445
00:26:29,628 --> 00:26:31,623
Yeah, Mrs. O'Brien
used to say that Mardah

446
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:34,038
should try to get some
of her stories published.

447
00:26:34,074 --> 00:26:35,100
Jake, they aren't that good.

448
00:26:35,145 --> 00:26:36,114
Yes, they are.

449
00:26:36,148 --> 00:26:38,052
Nothing like your poetry.

450
00:26:38,087 --> 00:26:41,393
You don't have
enough faith in yourself.

451
00:26:41,431 --> 00:26:43,597
Poetry... you write poetry?

452
00:26:43,638 --> 00:26:46,477
Well, sort of.

453
00:26:46,515 --> 00:26:48,180
N-not really.

454
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:51,354
Now who doesn't have
enough faith in themselves?

455
00:26:51,396 --> 00:26:54,600
He writes some of
the most beautiful things

456
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,977
I have ever read.

457
00:26:59,556 --> 00:27:01,551
That's what won me over.

458
00:27:04,973 --> 00:27:07,310
His poetry?

459
00:27:07,347 --> 00:27:09,843
And the way he plays dom-jot.

460
00:27:10,892 --> 00:27:12,055
You play dom-jot?

461
00:27:12,096 --> 00:27:13,589
Oh, your son can play.

462
00:27:13,634 --> 00:27:14,568
He's quite the hustler.

463
00:27:14,604 --> 00:27:15,504
A hustler?

464
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,409
Why don't I go see
how dessert's coming?

465
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:32,023
Jake seemed like just
another teenage boy at first...

466
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:35,127
but there's more to him
than that.

467
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:40,710
I'm beginning
to realize that myself.

468
00:27:40,754 --> 00:27:43,456
I care about him very much.

469
00:27:46,472 --> 00:27:48,707
And so do I.

470
00:27:50,552 --> 00:27:54,896
Now, tell me more
about my poet hustler son.

471
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,510
It's over here.

472
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,089
This is it.

473
00:28:03,126 --> 00:28:06,227
We tried to run an analysis of
it, but the computer

474
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:08,469
couldn't make heads
or tails of it.

475
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,775
Do you really think
this is the drug

476
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:10,782
the boy's addicted to?

477
00:28:10,817 --> 00:28:12,846
It seems logical
that the Founders

478
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:16,128
would have kept a supply
of the enzyme aboard his ship.

479
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:18,903
Hopefully, Dr. Bashir can
determine if this is it.

480
00:28:18,942 --> 00:28:22,316
Uh-huh. I still don't understand
why they would engineer someone

481
00:28:22,354 --> 00:28:24,189
to be addicted
to a certain chemical.

482
00:28:24,226 --> 00:28:26,996
I suspect it's another way
of ensuring the loyalty

483
00:28:27,035 --> 00:28:29,133
of the Jem'Hadar
to the Founders.

484
00:28:29,175 --> 00:28:31,843
If your soldiers
are addicted to a drug

485
00:28:31,884 --> 00:28:34,688
that can't be replicated
and only you can provide

486
00:28:34,726 --> 00:28:38,363
that gives you a great
deal of control over them.

487
00:28:38,405 --> 00:28:41,107
Seems a pretty
cold-blooded thing to do.

488
00:28:41,147 --> 00:28:44,521
My people don't have blood,
Chief.

489
00:28:48,871 --> 00:28:51,140
I believe this tube
intravenously delivers

490
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:53,448
the chemical agent
into the carotid artery.

491
00:28:53,553 --> 00:28:56,791
How large a dose is required?

492
00:28:56,831 --> 00:28:58,462
I'm not sure yet.

493
00:28:58,502 --> 00:29:00,201
This supply could last

494
00:29:00,241 --> 00:29:03,045
for a week or maybe
a month or even a year.

495
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:06,116
I have to experiment
to find the right dosage.

496
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,033
All right. We'll start with
two milligrams per minute.

497
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,772
Let me know if you
feel uncomfortable.

498
00:29:23,215 --> 00:29:25,484
Well, his heart rate
is slowing.

499
00:29:25,522 --> 00:29:29,296
Some increase in
neurotransmitter activity.

500
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:32,606
And his cortical impulse
readings are leveling out.

501
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,716
Let's try three cc's.

502
00:29:38,831 --> 00:29:41,202
I think we can
hold it there for now.

503
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:42,800
How do you feel?

504
00:29:42,844 --> 00:29:45,979
Good.

505
00:29:46,021 --> 00:29:47,457
Thank you.

506
00:29:49,465 --> 00:29:51,665
You should rest now.

507
00:29:51,705 --> 00:29:53,574
We'll talk later.

508
00:29:53,645 --> 00:29:55,344
I'll be in my quarters.

509
00:29:55,384 --> 00:29:56,148
Wait.

510
00:29:57,591 --> 00:29:58,993
I want to go with you.

511
00:29:59,029 --> 00:30:02,096
No, the doctor
will take care of you.

512
00:30:03,643 --> 00:30:06,139
I want to stay with you.

513
00:30:08,191 --> 00:30:10,163
He doesn't have to stay here

514
00:30:10,198 --> 00:30:13,333
as long as I can monitor
his condition regularly.

515
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:19,760
Well, it seems I have
my first houseguest.

516
00:30:30,892 --> 00:30:33,365
So you can change
into any of these objects?

517
00:30:33,401 --> 00:30:35,932
With varying degrees of success.

518
00:30:35,975 --> 00:30:39,714
Some forms are more difficult
to emulate than others.

519
00:30:39,821 --> 00:30:40,949
Like what?

520
00:30:40,991 --> 00:30:42,929
Like this one.

521
00:30:42,965 --> 00:30:44,903
As you can see

522
00:30:44,937 --> 00:30:47,342
I haven't mastered
the humanoid face.

523
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:49,681
I found it to be
quite challenging.

524
00:30:51,023 --> 00:30:53,725
Why do you want to look
like a humanoid?

525
00:30:53,765 --> 00:30:55,703
You're better than they are.

526
00:30:55,739 --> 00:30:58,407
You're a changeling.

527
00:30:58,447 --> 00:31:00,442
That doesn't make me better...

528
00:31:00,487 --> 00:31:01,923
just different.

529
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:08,735
But I know...

530
00:31:08,813 --> 00:31:10,682
in here...

531
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,286
that I am inferior to you.

532
00:31:13,328 --> 00:31:16,532
But everyone else here

533
00:31:16,571 --> 00:31:17,540
is inferior to me.

534
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:19,604
No. That may be
what your instincts tell you

535
00:31:19,648 --> 00:31:21,118
but it's not true.

536
00:31:21,152 --> 00:31:25,097
No one on this station
is better than anyone else.

537
00:31:25,132 --> 00:31:27,469
We're all equal.

538
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,813
Then I must be at fault

539
00:31:32,923 --> 00:31:37,096
because I know
that you cannot be wrong.

540
00:31:37,138 --> 00:31:39,977
The first thing we
have to establish

541
00:31:40,013 --> 00:31:41,814
is that I'm not infallible.

542
00:31:41,852 --> 00:31:43,847
I'm no different than you are
in that respect.

543
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:46,661
You have to begin
to think for yourself

544
00:31:46,701 --> 00:31:49,471
to make decisions
based on what you want

545
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,980
not what I want.

546
00:31:51,015 --> 00:31:52,987
Do you understand?

547
00:31:53,021 --> 00:31:54,457
Now tell me.

548
00:31:54,493 --> 00:31:56,020
What do you want right now?

549
00:31:56,064 --> 00:31:57,500
No, don't think about it.

550
00:31:57,535 --> 00:32:01,844
Just tell me the first thing
that comes to mind.

551
00:32:03,053 --> 00:32:04,854
I...

552
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,696
I want...

553
00:32:07,735 --> 00:32:11,007
I want to know more
about my people.

554
00:32:11,045 --> 00:32:13,884
Who I am and where I come from.

555
00:32:13,988 --> 00:32:15,823
I can understand that.

556
00:32:15,861 --> 00:32:19,635
I was also found by aliens.

557
00:32:19,673 --> 00:32:22,614
I didn't know who I was
or what my people were like.

558
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,176
Did you ever find them?

559
00:32:24,221 --> 00:32:25,521
Yes.

560
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:27,029
But...

561
00:32:27,063 --> 00:32:30,598
sometimes, the truth
is not very pleasant.

562
00:32:33,216 --> 00:32:34,276
Computer...

563
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,353
display Bridge Security
Log, USS <i>Defiant</i>

564
00:32:37,396 --> 00:32:40,634
Stardate 48214.5, time index

565
00:32:40,673 --> 00:32:42,007
310.

566
00:32:56,089 --> 00:32:57,559
These are my people?

567
00:32:57,594 --> 00:32:59,030
Yes.

568
00:32:59,065 --> 00:33:02,200
They're a race
of brutal warriors.

569
00:33:02,242 --> 00:33:05,514
But that doesn't mean
you have to be like that.

570
00:33:05,553 --> 00:33:08,961
You can channel your feelings
of aggression in other ways.

571
00:33:11,271 --> 00:33:12,502
How?

572
00:33:22,407 --> 00:33:25,280
Computer, run program Odo One.

573
00:33:29,663 --> 00:33:31,532
So this is not a real person?

574
00:33:31,569 --> 00:33:32,869
That's right.

575
00:33:32,907 --> 00:33:35,073
He can't be injured or killed.

576
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:37,485
He's just a computer simulation.

577
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,700
How strong is he?

578
00:33:41,735 --> 00:33:43,833
As strong as you
want to make him.

579
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:47,215
The computer will adjust
his strength, agility, speed...

580
00:33:47,252 --> 00:33:48,722
anything you want.

581
00:33:48,757 --> 00:33:51,026
In here, you can
indulge yourself.

582
00:33:51,065 --> 00:33:53,561
You can let
your instincts take over.

583
00:33:53,606 --> 00:33:55,841
Fight until you're ready to stop

584
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,350
but at a price.

585
00:33:57,384 --> 00:33:59,880
Out there, you have
to control yourself.

586
00:33:59,926 --> 00:34:01,557
You have to learn restraint.

587
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:04,072
Learn how to live peacefully
among other races

588
00:34:04,106 --> 00:34:06,010
regardless of how you may feel.

589
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:09,453
Learn to contain your feelings
of aggression and violence.

590
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:18,515
Can I?

591
00:34:37,647 --> 00:34:39,174
Can I do it again?

592
00:34:40,556 --> 00:34:42,117
Can I have a stronger opponent?

593
00:34:42,161 --> 00:34:47,269
Computer, increase difficulty
to level two.

594
00:34:55,437 --> 00:34:56,702
It's too easy!

595
00:34:56,741 --> 00:34:58,372
Make it more difficult!

596
00:34:58,413 --> 00:35:01,857
Computer,
increase to level three.

597
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,900
Can I speak to you for a moment?

598
00:35:27,305 --> 00:35:30,611
Computer,
increase to level five!

599
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:43,010
I heard you let him
move in with you.

600
00:35:43,055 --> 00:35:44,686
It was his idea.

601
00:35:44,727 --> 00:35:46,631
He feels safer with me around.

602
00:35:46,667 --> 00:35:48,366
Well, of course he does, Odo.

603
00:35:48,406 --> 00:35:50,641
He was programmed
to feel that way.

604
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,584
No, it's more than that.

605
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:55,560
I think I've begun
to form a real

606
00:35:55,596 --> 00:35:57,157
connection with him.

607
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,500
He trusts me.

608
00:35:58,538 --> 00:36:00,008
But can you trust him?

609
00:36:00,043 --> 00:36:01,411
How long do you think

610
00:36:01,514 --> 00:36:03,452
you're going to be
able to control him?

611
00:36:03,487 --> 00:36:05,960
I'm not trying to control any...

612
00:36:05,996 --> 00:36:07,466
anybody.

613
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,134
I'm just trying to give
him some choices

614
00:36:10,175 --> 00:36:12,945
other than becoming
a laboratory specimen

615
00:36:12,984 --> 00:36:14,580
or a Jem'Hadar soldier.

616
00:36:14,623 --> 00:36:16,823
I never thought
I would say this to you Odo,

617
00:36:16,864 --> 00:36:19,863
but you are listening
to your heart, not your head.

618
00:36:19,906 --> 00:36:22,402
That boy was created
in a laboratory.

619
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:27,155
His body, his mind,
his instincts are all designed

620
00:36:27,196 --> 00:36:29,796
to do one thing... to kill.

621
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:35,311
My body, mind and instincts
were designed to be a Founder.

622
00:36:35,356 --> 00:36:37,829
You were trained
to be a terrorist

623
00:36:37,864 --> 00:36:40,634
but each of us chose
to be something different.

624
00:36:40,673 --> 00:36:44,173
I just want to give him
the same chance we've had.

625
00:36:46,893 --> 00:36:48,363
All right.

626
00:36:49,935 --> 00:36:51,600
Give him a chance.

627
00:36:51,641 --> 00:36:55,085
Just don't forget
he is a Jem'Hadar.

628
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,354
He's dangerous.

629
00:36:57,393 --> 00:36:59,331
I'm well aware of the risk,
Major.

630
00:36:59,366 --> 00:37:01,304
I hope so.

631
00:37:12,207 --> 00:37:13,872
Computer, end program.

632
00:37:27,556 --> 00:37:29,791
Everyone keeps looking at me.

633
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,563
They're afraid of me.

634
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:41,597
They're mostly curious,
but they're also afraid.

635
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:42,603
They should be.

636
00:37:42,637 --> 00:37:44,336
I could kill any of them.

637
00:37:44,376 --> 00:37:47,180
Is that all you can
think about, killing?

638
00:37:47,218 --> 00:37:49,657
Isn't there anything
else you care about?

639
00:37:50,997 --> 00:37:52,331
I don't think so.

640
00:37:54,508 --> 00:37:57,643
There is so much more
to life than that.

641
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:01,664
So much more for you
to discover and experience.

642
00:38:01,732 --> 00:38:04,605
Maybe there is, for you.

643
00:38:04,674 --> 00:38:08,048
And maybe there is for all
of these other people here

644
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:09,282
but for me...

645
00:38:09,322 --> 00:38:10,519
Sisko to Odo.

646
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:12,155
Go ahead, Commander.

647
00:38:12,198 --> 00:38:14,798
I need to see you
in my office, Constable.

648
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,174
On my way.

649
00:38:17,883 --> 00:38:20,220
Wait for me in our quarters.

650
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,260
Something's wrong.

651
00:38:34,302 --> 00:38:36,707
Starfleet is sending
the USS <i>Constellation</i>

652
00:38:36,744 --> 00:38:37,975
to pick up the boy...

653
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:41,421
and then take him
to Starbase 201.

654
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:44,228
They'll be here in five hours.

655
00:38:44,267 --> 00:38:48,907
I thought we had an agreement.

656
00:38:48,948 --> 00:38:50,475
I'm sorry, Odo.

657
00:38:50,521 --> 00:38:53,291
Starfleet considers the boy
a top priority.

658
00:38:53,329 --> 00:38:54,960
I did everything I could

659
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:56,997
but orders are orders.

660
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:58,602
I put...

661
00:38:58,647 --> 00:39:01,851
You're not sending me anywhere.

662
00:39:06,874 --> 00:39:08,505
What do you want?

663
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:09,515
A runabout.

664
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,519
To go where?

665
00:39:10,553 --> 00:39:12,286
That's not your concern.

666
00:39:12,325 --> 00:39:13,693
Listen to me,
this is not the way...

667
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,291
I know what I'm doing.

668
00:39:15,334 --> 00:39:18,036
I'm leaving this place,
and you're going with me.

669
00:39:18,076 --> 00:39:20,880
You don't belong here
any more than I do.

670
00:39:21,989 --> 00:39:23,858
All right.

671
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:26,232
It won't be necessary
to hurt anyone.

672
00:39:26,269 --> 00:39:27,569
Commander Sisko

673
00:39:27,607 --> 00:39:29,739
will see to it that no one
interferes with us.

674
00:39:29,781 --> 00:39:32,483
If they do, I'll kill them.

675
00:39:39,178 --> 00:39:40,648
Where are we going?

676
00:39:40,682 --> 00:39:41,982
To the Gamma Quadrant.

677
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,148
It's where my people are.

678
00:39:43,191 --> 00:39:44,422
It's where your people are.

679
00:39:44,461 --> 00:39:45,487
It's where we both belong.

680
00:39:45,531 --> 00:39:46,522
I don't belong there.

681
00:39:46,568 --> 00:39:48,004
I don't believe you do either.

682
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:50,011
I won't allow them
to put me in a laboratory.

683
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,344
I won't go with them
to Starfleet.

684
00:39:51,382 --> 00:39:53,013
All right, but there
are other options

685
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,719
besides going
to the Gamma Quadrant.

686
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,595
We can find a place
where neither Starfleet

687
00:39:56,633 --> 00:39:59,038
nor the Jem'Hadar
will bother you.

688
00:39:59,074 --> 00:40:02,175
A place where you can grow
and learn about yourself

689
00:40:02,217 --> 00:40:05,489
without worrying about being
sent to some laboratory.

690
00:40:05,529 --> 00:40:06,623
It's a big galaxy.

691
00:40:06,665 --> 00:40:09,698
All we have to do is head out
for unexplored space

692
00:40:09,742 --> 00:40:10,870
and keep on going.

693
00:40:10,912 --> 00:40:13,888
I am willing to do this
with you.

694
00:40:13,922 --> 00:40:17,262
To help start you
on your new life

695
00:40:17,299 --> 00:40:19,134
if that's what you want.

696
00:40:22,114 --> 00:40:25,021
You just don't
understand, do you?

697
00:40:25,057 --> 00:40:28,090
I want to be with my people.

698
00:40:28,133 --> 00:40:31,804
I don't want to be
anywhere else.

699
00:40:31,845 --> 00:40:34,080
I'm not like
these other humanoids.

700
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:37,095
I'm a Jem'Hadar,
and that's what I want to be.

701
00:40:37,129 --> 00:40:40,002
You're not like these
other humanoids either

702
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:42,979
but they've done
something to you.

703
00:40:43,015 --> 00:40:48,465
They filled your mind with
ideas, with these beliefs.

704
00:40:51,508 --> 00:40:54,575
I don't know what the other
changelings are like

705
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,685
but I know they're not like you.

706
00:40:57,728 --> 00:40:59,495
No...

707
00:41:01,072 --> 00:41:02,703
they're not.

708
00:41:11,873 --> 00:41:15,179
Spread out,
but remember not to fire

709
00:41:15,218 --> 00:41:19,425
until you hear my command
or the boy fires first.

710
00:41:29,596 --> 00:41:31,261
This is as far as you go.

711
00:41:31,302 --> 00:41:32,933
Let us go, Commander.

712
00:41:32,974 --> 00:41:35,277
I'm leaving of my own accord.

713
00:41:35,348 --> 00:41:38,289
I'll take the boy
back to his people

714
00:41:38,324 --> 00:41:40,627
then return in the runabout.

715
00:41:42,404 --> 00:41:45,277
If he boards the <i>Constellation</i>
when it arrives

716
00:41:45,314 --> 00:41:47,514
he'll either kill a lot
of innocent people

717
00:41:47,554 --> 00:41:48,682
or be killed himself.

718
00:41:48,724 --> 00:41:51,962
What makes you think
he'll let you come back?

719
00:41:53,473 --> 00:41:56,643
I don't believe he could
injure a changeling.

720
00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:01,362
When the <i>Constellation</i> arrives

721
00:42:01,431 --> 00:42:06,037
I'll tell them that I couldn't
stop you from leaving.

722
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,211
That I would have had to kill
the boy to keep him here.

723
00:42:08,253 --> 00:42:11,627
Admiral Nechayev
won't like that answer

724
00:42:11,664 --> 00:42:15,004
but it has the virtue
of being the truth.

725
00:42:15,042 --> 00:42:16,980
Sisko to O'Brien.

726
00:42:17,014 --> 00:42:20,354
Release the security fields
around the airlock, Chief.

727
00:42:20,459 --> 00:42:22,625
Aye, sir.

728
00:42:25,775 --> 00:42:28,180
I'll see you when you get back.

729
00:42:34,871 --> 00:42:36,775
He was afraid of me.

730
00:42:36,811 --> 00:42:39,684
I could see the fear
in his eyes.

731
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,721
Commander Sisko was trying to do
what's best for you.

732
00:42:43,767 --> 00:42:45,032
He was trying to help you.

733
00:42:45,071 --> 00:42:46,975
He's not my friend.

734
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:48,641
He's my enemy!

735
00:42:48,683 --> 00:42:50,450
And I now know that anyone

736
00:42:50,522 --> 00:42:53,053
who is not a Jem'Hadar
is my enemy.

737
00:42:53,096 --> 00:42:55,125
Does that include me?

738
00:43:01,891 --> 00:43:03,989
Station Log, supplemental.

739
00:43:04,031 --> 00:43:06,163
Starfleet has expressed
disappointment

740
00:43:06,205 --> 00:43:08,269
over what it considers
a "missed opportunity"

741
00:43:08,312 --> 00:43:10,376
to learn more
about the Jem'Hadar.

742
00:43:10,418 --> 00:43:13,451
However, I'm happy to report
that with the boy gone

743
00:43:13,561 --> 00:43:16,560
life on the station
has returned to normal.

744
00:43:22,925 --> 00:43:25,091
I think we can get
the upper sensor grid

745
00:43:25,132 --> 00:43:26,466
back on line by morning.

746
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:29,069
Good. We're going to need it
in the next few days.

747
00:43:29,111 --> 00:43:31,607
I thought you were going
to lower the boom on those two.

748
00:43:31,653 --> 00:43:33,284
Well, I was, but some things

749
00:43:33,325 --> 00:43:35,320
came up at dinner
I didn't expect.

750
00:43:35,364 --> 00:43:37,097
Oh. Got to know her
a little better?

751
00:43:37,137 --> 00:43:38,698
Decided you liked her after all?

752
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:41,478
No, actually, I got to know
Jake a little better.

753
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:43,957
Have you ever played
dom-jot with him?

754
00:43:43,992 --> 00:43:44,961
No.

755
00:43:44,995 --> 00:43:46,431
Don't.

756
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:57,198
Major.

757
00:43:58,605 --> 00:44:00,634
About the boy.

758
00:44:08,102 --> 00:44:10,074
You were right.
