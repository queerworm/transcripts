Dabo!

(<i> laughing</i> )

00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,190
Dabo!

5
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:32,157
Dabo!

6
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:38,372
You aren't leaving?
Well...

7
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:42,751
Come on, aren't
you feeling lucky?

8
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,044
All right then,
one more time.

9
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,171
Let it ride.

00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,595
Oh...

<i>karjinko.</i>

13
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,933
Sorry.

14
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:05,524
Uh, wait
a minute there.

15
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:07,275
My name is Okalar.

16
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,527
What's yours?

17
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:10,237
Busy.

18
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,667
You are evil.

19
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,210
Who? Me?

20
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,755
He was going to
walk away a winner.

21
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:29,339
First rule of dabo is...

22
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,843
BOTH:
...Watch the wheel,
not the girl.

23
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:36,430
So, what's on the
menu tomorrow night?

24
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,099
Tomorrow night?
Dinner with your father.

25
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,351
What?

26
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,603
He didn't tell you?

27
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,103
He came by this afternoon

28
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:46,356
and invited me to dinner
tomorrow night.

29
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,149
In fact, he said
it was your idea.

30
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,070
My idea?

31
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,489
Oh, I, I, I guess I might
have mentioned something

32
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,575
about having you over.

33
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,118
I, I thought he forgot.

34
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,955
It is all right,
isn't it?

35
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:04,666
I mean, you don't
mind, do you?

36
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:08,754
Oh, no.
No, of course not.

37
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,840
It'll be great.

38
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,467
You're going to love
my dad's cooking.

39
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,064
This is a surprise.

40
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,232
A pleasant one,
I hope.

41
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,859
So do I.

42
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:34,362
I have some salvage
for you, Quark.

43
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,035
This isn't a good time to be
selling your kind of salvage.

44
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,746
No, no, no, it's
perfectly legal.

45
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,874
I mean, it's really
salvage this time.

46
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,209
I'm not looking
for junk right now,

47
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,878
but...

48
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,757
I'm more in the market
for entertainment.

49
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:57,052
I think you'll like
this junk, Quark.

50
00:02:57,052 --> 00:03:00,305
It's a wreckage from
a ship that crashed

51
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,723
in the Gamma Quadrant.

52
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,558
You're still going
to the Gamma Quadrant?

53
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,894
Mm-hmm.
(<i> chuckles</i> )

54
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:09,106
I love bold women.
How much?

55
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,650
Three bars of latinum
and you can have it all.

56
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,901
What kind of ship is it?

57
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,235
I don't know.

58
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,278
Can I see it first?

59
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,446
There's no time.

60
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,157
Oh...

61
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:23,954
Quark, you and I have been
doing business for years.

62
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,205
Don't you trust me?

63
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:01,491
Three bars of latinum?

64
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,993
(<i> sighs</i> )

65
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:03,994
It was worth it.

66

72
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,492
No.

73
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,913
No.

74
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,709
No.

(<i> baby cooing</i> )

76
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,668
You bought a child?

77
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,420
I just thought that I was
buying some wreckage.

78
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,007
How was I supposed to know
there was a baby in there?

79
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,675
Maybe you should
inspect the merchandise

80
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,135
before you make the deal,

81
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,346
or isn't there a Rule
of Acquisition for that?

82
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,266
There is and I<i> do,</i> usually.

83
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,850
We haven't been able to
trace the Boslic captain

84
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,685
since she left the station.

85
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,729
Her flight plan said
she was headed for Risa,

86
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,357
but I don't think we should
put much faith in that.

87
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,650
Well, I haven't been able
to identify his species,

88
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,860
but he<i> seems</i> to be healthy.

89
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,903
Seems?

90
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,738
For a humanoid,
he has

91
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,656
an incredibly fast
metabolic rate.

92
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,076
The cells in his body
are dividing at a pace

93
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,203
I haven't seen
outside of a laboratory.

94
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,913
But, since there are no thyroid
or hypothalmic problems,

95
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,748
I assume that this
is only natural

96
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,375
for someone of his species,

97
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,834
but I would like him here
for further tests.

98
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,711
Very well.

99
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,965
What do we know about
the ship the boy was on?

100
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,716
Chief O'Brien
just started

101
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,842
to analyze the wreckage.

102
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,428
We should have
a preliminary report

103
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:51,554
in a couple of hours.
Ah, uh, now wait a minute.

104
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,099
I paid good money
for that wreckage and...

105
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,144
and now it's yours.

106
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:00,439
Enjoy.

107
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,034
Hmm.

108
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,037
Hi there.

109
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,334
DAX:
We should contact

110
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,961
one of the orphanages
on Bajor and let them know

111
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,255
we might have
someone for them.

112
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,215
Hmm?

113
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,510
I was talking
about an orphanage.

114
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,430
Oh, right.

115
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,100
Have Major Kira make the
appropriate arrangements.

116
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:43,106
Will you keep me informed
about him?

117
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,820
Yes, sir.

118
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,828
What?

119
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,788
You are positively glowing.

120
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,374
Oh, come on.

121
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,209
I haven't seen that look
on your face since...

122
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,627
Since Jake stopped
wearing diapers.

123
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,464
I never thought

124
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,966
I'd hear myself
saying this,

125
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,552
but I miss taking
care of Jake

126
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,471
when he was a baby.

127
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:18,099
I miss holding him,
singing to him at night,

128
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,476
feeding him.

129
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,896
Listening to him cry,
changing his diapers,

130
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,148
worrying when he was sick.

131
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,733
I haven't forgotten.

132
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,529
But there are times

133
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:33,365
when I would give
almost anything

134
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:36,493
for the days when I
could make Jake happy

135
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,287
just by lifting
him over my head.

136
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,289
Good night.

137
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,928
(<i> door opening</i> )

138
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:01,101
Hey, how about a hug
for the old man?

139
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,107
Why didn't you tell me

140
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,776
you were going to
invite Mardah to dinner?

141
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,903
Well, I did, weeks ago.

142
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:15,323
I told you if you
didn't invite her soon,

143
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,158
I'd invite her myself.

144
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,997
I, I still wish you'd given me
a little more warning.

145
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,625
Well, I didn't realize

146
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,962
that a dinner invitation
required so much warning.

147
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:32,924
It doesn't, and it's not
a problem or anything.

148
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,343
It just caught me by surprise.

149
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,430
Well, dinner isn't
until tomorrow night.

150
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,641
That'll give you
a full day to prepare her

151
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:46,146
for the traumatic experience of
having dinner with the old man.

152
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,897
Yeah.

153
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,566
Uh, I mean, there's
nothing to prepare for.

154
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,733
It's just dinner.

155
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,152
Exactly.

156
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,487
Right.

157
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,238
Right.

158
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,782
All right.

159
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,127
You wanted to
see me, Doctor?

160
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,254
Yes, it's about
our new visitor.

161
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,089
Is something wrong
with the baby?

162
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,842
No, but he's not
a baby anymore.

163
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,484
BASHIR:
There are a great many species
with what we would call

164
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:35,320
accelerated growth rates,
but they're usually

165
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,239
small, physiologically
simple creatures.

166
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,660
I've never seen such
a rapid maturation process

167
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,287
in anything as complex
as a humanoid.

168
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:47,207
He looks about eight
or nine years old.

169
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,126
But how old is
he in reality?

170
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,462
Well, judging by his
cellular kinetic profile,

171
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,215
I'd say he's no more
than two weeks of age.

172
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,383
Who are you?

173
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:05,141
I'm Benjamin
and that's Julian.

174
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,561
Do you have a name?

175
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,896
I need food.

176
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,108
With your kind of metabolism,
I'm not surprised.

177
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,444
I'll get you something
in a few minutes.

178
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,487

On a space station.

180
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,616
Do you know what that is?

181
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:23,326
No.

182
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,537
But I want to learn.

183
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:31,167
I'd say we have a lot
to learn from each other.

184
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,795
Um...

185
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,298
I'll be right back.

186
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,223
Advanced language skills.

187
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,558
And cognitive reasoning.

188
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,309
He didn't just
pick those up

189
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,061
by sitting there
listening to us.

190
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:52,230
This is either a natural
ability in his species

191
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,772
or some kind of
basic intelligence

192
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,525
implanted into his
genetic structure.

193
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,652
Implanted?
You mean artificially?

194
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,987
Yes, and I tend to discount
the possibility

195
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,489
that it<i> is</i>
a natural ability.

196
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,366
His biomolecular
diffusion gradient

197
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,493
all ready suggests that
his cellular mitosis

198
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,911
has been artificially
enhanced.

199
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,456
So, you're saying
he may have been part

200
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,665
of some experiment?

201
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,751
Possibly. If so,
he's an example

202
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:15,629
of some very advanced
genetic engineering.

203
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,964
His cognitive abilities
are developing

204
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,840
without any
external stimuli.

205
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,343
I want you to test
his mental abilities.

206
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,678
See if they increase.

207
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,221
Maybe he'll
get to the point

208
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,181
where he can
tell us who he is

209
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,683
and where he's come from.

210
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,108
This is where Quark
said he found the boy.

211
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,736
It seems to be some
kind of stasis chamber

212
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,613
that was damaged
in the crash.

213
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:43,531
That could imply
they didn't want him

214
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,450
to begin maturing
while he was on board.

215
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,702
What about the rest
of the wreckage?

216
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,287
It seems to indicate

217
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,122
this was some kind of freighter
or transport vessel.

218
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,957
Did you find
any computers

219
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,501
or other information
systems?

220
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,753
No, not yet.
Most of it's just junk--

221
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,005
twisted bulkheads,
burnt deck plating,

222
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,799
that sort of thing.

223
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,134
We should have
a full inventory
by tomorrow morning.

224
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,344
Good.

225
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,429
By the way,
the replicators

226
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,432
in my quarters are
on the blink again.

227
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:12,101
Could you spare someone
this afternoon to fix them?

228
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:15,104
Oh, that's right.
Tonight's the big dinner
with Mardah.

229
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,439
You know about that?

230
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,358
Well, Jake mentioned it
this morning.

231
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,901
In fact, I'd say it's
the only thing on his mind.

232
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,363
You would think I was going
to court-martial her

233
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,739
by the way he's acting.

234
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,616
Well, I guess
it's only natural.

235
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,409
Bringing a girl home
for the first time

236
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,828
is a pretty traumatic
experience.

237
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:32,372
Quark may call her
a dabo girl,

238
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,332
but she's 20 years old.

239
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,125
She's a woman.

240
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,377
And Jake is a 16-year-old boy.

241
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,795
It has to stop.

242
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,463
Well, why did you
invite her over?

243
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,173
If you don't mind my asking.

244
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,550
Curiosity mostly.

245
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,468
I wanted to see
what I was up against.

246
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,512
What if it turns out
you like her?

247
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:51,432
She's a dabo girl.
She's dating my son.

248
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,768
I don't want to like her.

249
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,612
Sixteen years old
and dating a dabo girl.

250
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,531
Godspeed, Jake.

251
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,963
Major.

252
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,841
Odo.

253
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,926
For you.

254
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,595
Ah.

255
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,389
Let me guess--

256
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:34,809
uh, decoration for
my new quarters.

257
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,395
Just a little something
to brighten your room.

258
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:42,316
That's, uh, very...
thoughtful of you.

259
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,818
You're welcome.

260
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,447
(<i> sighs</i> )

261
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,700
I suppose you'd like
to see my new quarters.

262
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,869
Everyone wants
to see your quarters.

263
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,829
It's called curiosity.

264
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,206
Ah.

265
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,251
(<i> sighs</i> )

266
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,392
It's not really
finished yet.

267
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,269
This is just the start.

268
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,729
The start of what?

269
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,775
I want to make this room

270
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:26,360
into a place
where I can explore

271
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,739
what it truly means
to be a shape-shifter.

272
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,909
I thought it had to be
something like that.

273
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,328
I mean, you don't
exactly need

274
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:39,248
an entire set of quarters
just to sit in your bucket.

275
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,918
I don't use
the bucket anymore.

276
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:46,005
I've kept it to remind
me of how I used to be.

277
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:52,261
But now, when I need
to regenerate,

278
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:56,933
I simply revert to my gelatinous
state anywhere in this room.

279
00:16:56,933 --> 00:17:02,939
Here, I can experiment with
different shapes, textures.

280
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:06,526
I can bring
in various forms to emulate.

281
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,111
And I can do it in private.

282
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:13,533
I'm sorry if I intruded.

283
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,660
Maybe I should leave.

284
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,912
No, please.

285
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:20,748
You're always welcome here,
Major.

286
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,837
Well...

287
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,090
where should we put it?

288
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,467
Ah!

289
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,483
Perfect.

290
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:03,666
The boy's DNA sequence
has definitely been altered.

291
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,919
The nucleotide analysis
proves that conclusively.

292
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,629
So he's a product
of genetic engineering.

293
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,758
But why?
Was he a unique experiment

294
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,594
or is this sort of thing
common in his species?

295
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,137
There's more.
His blood chemistry

296
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,181
shows that he's missing
a key isogenic enzyme,

297
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,017
and without large
quantities of it,

298
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,436
his circulatory system
would simply shut down.

299
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,021
Can you replicate
this enzyme?

300
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,981
I've been trying, and
I think I've come up

301
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,441
with a temporary
substitute.

302
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,610
But what I don't
understand is

303
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,946
why anybody would want to
genetically engineer someone
with such an obvious flaw.

304
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,655
Nurse Hortak to Dr. Bashir.

305
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,824
You're needed in
the Infirmary immediately.

306
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,868
On my way.

307
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,586
Listen, it's all right.

308
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,755
No one's going to hurt you.

309
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,256
Let's just go back
inside and, and...

310
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,133
(<i> groans</i> )
(<i> crowd gasps</i> )

311
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,261
Security
to Promenade!

312
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,391
Stop!
Stay where you are!

313
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:17,698
Dax to Sisko.

314
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,075
SISKO:
Go ahead.

315
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:21,285
I think we've
solved the mystery

316
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,705
of our young
visitor, Benjamin.
He's a Jem'Hadar.

317
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,341
SISKO:
I've just spoken with
Starfleet Command.

318
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,759
They want to make sure

319
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,511
he's healthy
enough to travel

320
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,179
and then send him
to Starbase 201,

321
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,181
where he'll
be handed over

322
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,975
to a team
of specialists.

323
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:45,893
KIRA:
Sounds good to me.
The sooner, the better.

324
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,561
What sort
of specialists

325
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,147
are we talking
about, Commander?

326
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:51,816
There will be a complete
team of xenobiologists

327
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,943
and exopsychologists
waiting for him.

328
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,654
So they're going
to study him

329
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,823
like a laboratory
specimen.

330
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,616
Well, he'll be
very well treated.

331
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:04,037
So he'll be
a well-treated specimen.

332
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,705
I have to agree
with Odo, Commander.

333
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,456
We can't just
ship him off

334
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,208
like some biological
sample that we've found.

335
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,002
He's a sentient
life form.

336
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:13,171
True, but the Founders
could have removed

337
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:14,463
his sense of free will.

338
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,549
He may be nothing more

339
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,968
than a genetically
programmed killing machine.

340
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,469
I agree, and we don't want

341
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,262
one of them walking
around this station.

342
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,639
Fine!

343
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,933
If you want answers
about the Jem'Hadar,

344
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,644
I'm the one who can
find them for you.

345
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,270
Let me get to know him.

346
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,774
I'll be responsible
for his conduct while he's here.

347
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,696
Odo, do you really think
you can control him?

348
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:42,116
He's already shown
a certain deference to me.

349
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:45,870
That's probably another
genetic alteration implanted

350
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,540
by the Founders to ensure
the Jem'Hadar's loyalty.

351
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,251
I can keep him
from harming anyone.

352
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,171
I'd like to speak with
the Constable in private

353
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:56,547
for a moment, please.

354
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,972
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

355
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,515
Talk to me, Odo.

356
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,518
Tell me what's
really going on here.

357
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,562
What the Founders
did to the boy--

358
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:14,774
to all the Jem'Hadar--
is not your fault.

359
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,609
Maybe not.

360
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:21,197
But I feel an obligation
to undo some of the damage

361
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,908
that my race
has done to this boy.

362
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,952
And I also know what it's like

363
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,703
to be a specimen
in a laboratory.

364
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,872
Oh, I'm sure they'll
treat him very well.

365
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:32,959
No one will risk
harming their new prize.

366
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,461
They'll be courteous, caring,

367
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,337
treat him
like he's among friends,

368
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:40,549
but in the end, he'll be
just another specimen to them--

369
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,552
something to be analyzed
and catalogued.

370
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,263
Give me the chance to find out

371
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:49,683
if he really<i> is</i> just
a programmed killing machine,

372
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:53,854
or if we can help him
become something else.

373
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,440
(<i> sighs</i> )

374
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,484
I'll tell Starfleet

375
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:01,695
we have some
preliminary tests

376
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,991
to run before we send
him to Starbase 201.

377
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,533
Thank you, Commander.

378
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:10,412
Just... be careful, Odo.

379
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:13,582
He is still a Jem'Hadar.

380
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:27,847
BASHIR:
Listen to me!

381
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,682
I'm trying to help.

382
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:30,891
Your body is craving

383
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,059
a certain
chemical compound.

384
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,978
That is why you're
feeling anxious

385
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,146
and having
muscle spasms.

386
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:37,648
There's nothing
wrong with me.

387
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:40,067
Yes, there is,
and denying it

388
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,902
won't make it go away.

389
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,196
Leave me alone!

390
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,450
You can wait outside.

391
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:54,290
I think everything
is under control now.

392
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,794
Please...

393
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,546
sit down.

394
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:09,805
You don't
look well.

395
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,389
How do you feel?

396
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:13,391
Something's wrong with me.

397
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:17,313
I feel sick
when I eat.

398
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,815
I have pains
in my head...

399
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,525
in my chest.

400
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,777
His body's addicted
to a specific isogenic enzyme.

401
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,530
Right now, he's experiencing
all the symptoms of withdrawal.

402
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,574
Addicted?
That's right.

403
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,701
Can you replicate
this enzyme?

404
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:33,162
BASHIR:
I've had some success
with triglycerides

405
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,621
but they're just
a stopgap measure.

406
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,916
I can't get an exact
chemical formula

407
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,709
without doing further tests

408
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,544
but he's shown certain
resistance to that idea.

409
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,296
I don't want any more tests.

410
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,382
Dr. Bashir is
trying to help you.

411
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:46,384
You should let him.

412
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,054
You may run your tests.

413
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,979
My name is Odo.

414
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,606
I don't have a name.

415
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:01,982
When your tests
are done,

416
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,859
I can get you
out of here,

417
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,736
maybe show you
around the station.

418
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:07,113
If you wish.

419
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,655
What do<i> you</i> want?

420
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:11,449
Do you have any needs
or desires of your own?

421
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,826
I want to fight!

422
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,328
Who, me?

423
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:16,663
No.
The others.

424
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,165
Why?

425
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,793
I don't know, but that's
what I want to do.

426
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,795
Is that wrong?

427
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,504
Well, let's just say,
we need to find

428
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,715
other interests
for you to pursue.

429
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:30,010
For the moment,
why don't you relax?

430
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,430
Try not to be so tense.

431
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,598
Take it easy.

432
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,643
Smile.

433
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,019
A smile.

434
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,438
You know...

435
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,990
Well, we'll
work on that.

436
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,595
Smells good.
What is it?

437
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:17,557
Ah, shrimp Creole
with Mandalay sauce--

438
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:18,809
one of my
father's recipes.

439
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:19,935
You're going to love this.

440
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,854
I hope you like
spicy food.

441
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:24,231
This sure
has a bite.

442
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:32,114
So, Mardah, tell me
a little about yourself.

443
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:34,074
What do you
want to know?

444
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,285
Oh, anything.

445
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:39,121
Family.

446
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,374
There isn't much to tell.

447
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:43,541
It's a pretty
familiar story.

448
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:46,295
Parents killed
during the occupation.

449
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:47,921
Raised by my neighbors

450
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,798
until I was 13.

451
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,591
Then I moved out
on my own.

452
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:54,261
I have a sister and
a brother on Bajor,

453
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,472
but we haven't
talked in years.

454
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,557
Why not?

455
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:02,019
Sarjeno and Koran
were not exactly thrilled

456
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:04,688
when I told them I had a job
as a dabo girl.

457
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,857
Then I told them
what I thought

458
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:10,986
of<i> their</i> lives,
and we stopped speaking.

459
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,655
I see.

460
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,782
It's amazing
how some people will judge you

461
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,617
based on nothing more
than your job.

462
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,752
Did I mention that Mardah's
quite a writer?

463
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,295
Uh, really?

464
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,130
Yeah, Mrs. O'Brien
used to say that Mardah

465
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,590
should try to get some
of her stories published.

466
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,718
Jake, they aren't that good.
Yes, they are.

467
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,429
Nothing like your poetry.

468
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:39,806
You don't have
enough faith
in yourself.

469
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:42,351
Poetry... you write poetry?

470
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,937
Well, sort of.

471
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,772
N-not really.

472
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:47,940
Now who
doesn't have

473
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,900
enough faith
in themselves?

474
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,028
He writes some of
the most beautiful things

475
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,281
I have ever read.

476
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:59,993
That's what won me over.

477
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,874
His poetry?

478
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,377
And the way
he plays dom-jot.

479
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:09,378
(<i> giggles</i> )

480
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:10,628
You play dom-jot?

481
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:11,964
MARDAH:
Oh, your son can play.

482
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,049
He's quite the hustler.
A hustler?

483
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,843
Why don't I go see
how dessert's coming?
(<i> laughs nervously</i> )

484
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:30,483
Jake seemed like just
another teenage boy at first...

485
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:33,569
but there's more to him
than that.

486
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:37,697
I'm beginning
to realize that myself.

487
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:41,827
I care about him very much.

488
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,124
And so do I.

489
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:53,088
Now, tell me more
about my poet-hustler son.

490
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:57,843
O'BRIEN:
It's over here.

491
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:01,514
This is it.

492
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:03,723
We tried to run
an analysis of it,

493
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,100
but the computer

494
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,977
couldn't make heads
or tails of it.

495
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:09,104
Do you really think
this is the drug
the boy's addicted to?

496
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,190
It seems logical
that the Founders

497
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,816
would have kept
a supply

498
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,527
of the enzyme
aboard his ship.

499
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:17,279
Hopefully, Dr. Bashir can
determine if this is it.

500
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,532
Uh-huh. I still
don't understand

501
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:20,824
why they would
engineer someone

502
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,535
to be addicted
to a certain chemical.

503
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:25,371
I suspect it's another way
of ensuring the loyalty

504
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:27,581
of the Jem'Hadar
to the Founders.

505
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:30,334
If your soldiers are
addicted to a drug

506
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:33,170
that can't be replicated
and only you can provide,

507
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,840
that gives you a great
deal of control over them.

508
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,385
Seems a pretty
cold-blooded thing to do.

509
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:42,804
My people don't
have blood, Chief.

510
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,477
BASHIR:
I believe this tube

511
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,688
intravenously delivers
the chemical agent

512
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:51,980
into the carotid artery.

513
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,025
How large a dose is required?

514
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,902
I'm not sure yet.

515
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,487
This supply could last

516
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:01,532
for a week or maybe
a month or even a year.

517
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:04,660
I have to experiment
to find the right dosage.

518
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,329
All right. We'll start with
two milligrams per minute.

519
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:10,123
Let me know if you
feel uncomfortable.

520
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,845
Well, his heart rate
is slowing.

521
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:27,683
Some increase in
neurotransmitter activity.

522
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:29,393
And his cortical
impulse readings

523
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:30,852
are leveling out.

524
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,981
Let's try 3cc's.

525
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,570
I think we can
hold it there for now.

526
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,029
How do you feel?

527
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:44,241
Good.

528
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:45,618
Thank you.

529
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,788
You should rest now.

530
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,998
We'll talk later.

531
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,584
I'll be in my quarters.

532
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:57,379
Wait.
I want to go with you.

533
00:29:57,379 --> 00:30:00,382
No, the doctor
will take care of you.

534
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:04,177
I want to stay with<i> you.</i>

535
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,390
He doesn't have
to stay here,

536
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,602
as long as I can monitor
his condition regularly.

537
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:17,899
Well, it seems I have
my first houseguest.

538
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,538
So you can change
into any of these objects?

539
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:34,291
With varying
degrees of success.

540
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:38,128
Some forms are more difficult
to emulate than others.

541
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:40,172
Like what?

542
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,132
Like this one.

543
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:44,217
As you can see,

544
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,553
I haven't mastered
the humanoid face.

545
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,847
I found it to be
quite challenging.

546
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:53,059
Why do you want to look
like a humanoid?

547
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,770
You're better than they are.

548
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,523
You're a changeling.

549
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,399
That doesn't make me better...

550
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,984
just different.

551
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,825
But I know...

552
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:09,702
in here...

553
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:12,454
that I am inferior to you.

554
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:15,708
But everyone else here

555
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,167
is inferior to me.

556
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,794
No. That may be
what your instincts tell you,

557
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,212
but it's not true.

558
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,839
No one on
this station

559
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:24,174
is better than
anyone else.

560
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:26,426
We're all equal.

561
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:32,057
Then I must be at fault,

562
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:36,061
because I know
that you cannot be wrong.

563
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,856
The first thing we
have to establish

564
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:41,024
is that I'm not
infallible.

565
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,068
I'm no different than
you are in that respect.

566
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:45,738
You have to begin
to think for yourself,

567
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:48,615
to make decisions
based on what<i> you</i> want,

568
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,949
not what<i> I</i> want.

569
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,993
Do you understand?

570
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,537
Now tell me.

571
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:54,954
What do you want right now?

572
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,498
No, don't think about it.

573
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,958
Just tell me
the first thing

574
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,794
that comes to mind.

575
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,922
I...

576
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,842
I want...

577
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:10,053
I want to know more
about my people.

578
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,931
Who I am and where I come from.

579
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,767
I can understand that.

580
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:18,228
I was also found by aliens.

581
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:21,774
I didn't know who I was
or what my people were like.

582
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:23,191
Did you ever find them?

583
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,359
Yes.

584
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,152
But...

585
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:29,489
sometimes, the truth
is not very pleasant.

586
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:33,201
Computer...

587
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,329
display Bridge Security
Log, USS<i> Defiant,</i>

588
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:40,959
stardate 48214.5,
time index 310.

589
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:44,630
(<i> grunts, blows landing</i> )

590
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:57,768
These are my people?
Yes.

591
00:32:57,768 --> 00:33:01,229
They're a race
of brutal warriors.

592
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,691
But that doesn't mean
you have to be like that.

593
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,903
You can channel your feelings
of aggression in other ways.

594
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:11,323
How?

595
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:24,252
Computer, run
program Odo One.

596
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,467
So this is not
a real person?

597
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:31,802
That's right.

598
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:34,137
He can't be injured
or killed.

599
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,222
He's just a computer
simulation.

600
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,602
How strong is he?

601
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,855
As strong as you
want to make him.

602
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:44,189
The computer
will adjust

603
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,065
his strength,
agility, speed--

604
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,609
anything you want.

605
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:50,069
In here, you can
indulge yourself.

606
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:52,364
You can let your
instincts take over.

607
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,616
Fight until you're
ready to stop,

608
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,201
but at a price.

609
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:58,871
Out there, you have
to control yourself.

610
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:00,455
You have to
learn restraint.

611
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:03,000
Learn how to live peacefully
among other races,

612
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,002
regardless of
how you may feel.

613
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:08,171
Learn to contain your feelings
of aggression and violence.

614
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,222
Can I?

615
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,142
(<i> grunts</i> )

616
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,063
(<i> grunting</i> )

617
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,993
Can I do it again?

618
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,038
Can I have
a stronger opponent?

619
00:34:41,038 --> 00:34:46,084
Computer, increase difficulty
to level two.

620
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,970
It's too easy!
Make it more difficult!

621
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:00,515
Computer,
increase to level three.

622
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,689
(<i> grunting and groaning</i>
<i>continues</i> )

623
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:16,031
Can I speak to you
for a moment?

624
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:29,210
Computer,
increase to level five!

625
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,681
I heard you let him
move in with you.

626
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,391
It was his idea.

627
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,393
He feels safer
with me around.

628
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,312
Well, of course
he does, Odo.

629
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,272
He was programmed
to feel that way.

630
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,190
No, it's more
than that.

631
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,319
I think I've begun
to form a real

632
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,779
connection with him.

633
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:57,238
He trusts me.

634
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,324
But can you trust him?

635
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,827
How long do you think
you're going to be
able to control him?

636
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:04,203
I'm not trying
to control any...

637
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,914
anybody.

638
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:08,541
I'm just trying to give
him some choices

639
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:11,336
other than becoming
a laboratory specimen

640
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,130
or a Jem'Hadar soldier.

641
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,381
I never thought I would
say this to you, Odo,

642
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:18,259
but you are listening
to your heart, not your head.

643
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,887
That boy was created
in a laboratory.

644
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:25,600
His body, his mind,
his instincts are all designed

645
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,311
to do one thing-- to kill.

646
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:33,733
My body, mind and instincts
were designed to be a Founder.

647
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,069
You were trained
to be a terrorist,

648
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:39,072
but each of us chose
to be something different.

649
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:42,367
I just want to give him
the same chance we've had.

650
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:46,579
All right.

651
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,916
Give him a chance.

652
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:53,419
Just don't forget
he is a Jem'Hadar.

653
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,630
He's dangerous.

654
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,465
I'm well aware
of the risk, Major.

655
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,467
I hope so.

656
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:10,520
(<i> grunting</i> )

657
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,980
ODO:
Computer,
end program.

658
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,570
(<i> panting</i> )

659
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:28,038
Everyone keeps
looking at me.

660
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:29,789
They're afraid of me.

661
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:39,591
They're mostly curious,
but they're also afraid.

662
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,677
They should be.
I could kill
any of them.

663
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,430
Is that all you can
think about, killing?

664
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,849
Isn't there anything
else you care about?

665
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,393
I don't think so.

666
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,729
(<i> sighs</i> )

667
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:55,982
There is so much more
to life than that.

668
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:59,861
So much more for you
to discover and experience.

669
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:02,906
Maybe there is, for you.

670
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:06,325
And maybe there is for all
of these other people here,

671
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,619
but for me...

672
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:08,661
Sisko to Odo.

673
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,413
Go ahead, Commander.

674
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,999
I need to see you
in my office, Constable.

675
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,251
On my way.

676
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:18,296
Wait for me in our quarters.

677
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,435
Something's wrong.

678
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,771
Starfleet is sending
the USS<i> Constellation</i>

679
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:37,149
to pick up the boy...
(<i> sighs</i> )

680
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:39,567
and then take him
to Starbase 201.

681
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,445
They'll be here
in five hours.

682
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:47,033
I thought we had
an agreement.

683
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,701
I'm sorry, Odo.

684
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:51,537
Starfleet considers the boy
a top priority.

685
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,081
I did everything I could,

686
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:55,167
but orders are orders.

687
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,876
I put...

688
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,963
You're not sending me anywhere.

689
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:07,512
What do you want?

690
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:08,513
A runabout.

691
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:09,472
To go where?

692
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,432
That's not your concern.

693
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,642
Listen to me, this
is not the way.

694
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:14,311
I know what I'm doing.

695
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:16,980
I'm leaving this place,
and you're going with me.

696
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,941
You don't belong here
any more than I do.

697
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:22,819
All right.

698
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:25,363
It won't be necessary
to hurt anyone.

699
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,739
Commander Sisko

700
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,658
will see to it that no one
interferes with us.

701
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:31,410
If they do, I'll kill them.

702
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,836
Where are we going?

703
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,629
To the Gamma Quadrant.
It's where my people are.

704
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,089
It's where your
people are.

705
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,091
It's where
we both belong.

706
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,093
I don't belong there.
I don't believe
you do either.

707
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,887
I won't allow them to
put me in a laboratory.

708
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,388
I won't go with
them to Starfleet.

709
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,015
All right, but there
are other options

710
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:53,850
besides going to
the Gamma Quadrant.

711
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,310
We can find a place
where neither Starfleet

712
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:58,188
nor the Jem'Hadar
will bother you.

713
00:39:58,188 --> 00:40:01,107
A place where you can grow
and learn about yourself

714
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,651
without worrying about being
sent to some laboratory.

715
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,611
It's a big galaxy.

716
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,531
All we have to do is head out
for unexplored space

717
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,699
and keep on going.

718
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:12,702
I am willing to do this
with you.

719
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:16,206
To help start you
on your new life,

720
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:18,958
if that's what you want.

721
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,880
You just don't
understand, do you?

722
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,925
I want to be
with<i> my</i> people.

723
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:30,803
I don't want to be
anywhere else.

724
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,056
I'm not like these
other humanoids.

725
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:36,142
I'm a Jem'Hadar,
and that's what I want to be.

726
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,770
You're not like these
other humanoids either,

727
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,773
but they've done
something to you.

728
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:44,525
They filled your mind
with ideas,

729
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,153
with these beliefs.

730
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:53,201
I don't know what the other
changelings are like,

731
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:56,413
but I know
they're not like you.

732
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:58,164
No...

733
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,418
they're not.

734
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:14,222
Spread out,
but remember not to fire

735
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:18,101
until you hear my command
or the boy fires first.

736
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:30,113
This is as far as you go.

737
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:31,864
Let us go, Commander.

738
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,075
I'm leaving of
my own accord.

739
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:37,078
I'll take the boy
back to his people,

740
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:39,289
then return
in the runabout.

741
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,960
If he boards the<i> Constellation</i>
when it arrives,

742
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,213
he'll either kill a lot
of innocent people
or be killed himself.

743
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:50,425
What makes you think
he'll let you come back?

744
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:55,263
I don't believe he could
injure a changeling.

745
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:59,976
When the<i> Constellation</i> arrives,

746
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:04,605
I'll tell them that I couldn't
stop you from leaving.

747
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,941
That I would have had to kill
the boy to keep him here.

748
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:10,153
Admiral Nechayev
won't like that answer,

749
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:13,406
but it has the virtue
of being the truth.

750
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:15,574
Sisko to O'Brien.

751
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:18,870
Release the security fields
around the airlock, Chief.

752
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,997
O'BRIEN:
Aye, sir.

753
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:26,669
I'll see you
when you get back.

754
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:35,345
He was afraid of me.

755
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:38,931
I could see the fear
in his eyes.

756
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,893
Commander Sisko
was trying to do
what's best for you.

757
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:43,353
He was trying to help you.

758
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:45,313
He's not my friend.

759
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,065
He's my enemy!

760
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,858
And I now know
that anyone

761
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:51,444
who is not a Jem'Hadar
is my enemy.

762
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:53,530
Does that include me?

763
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,497
SISKO:
<i>Station Log, supplemental.</i>

764
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:04,707
<i>Starfleet has expressed</i>
<i>disappointment</i>

765
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,876
<i>over what it considers</i>
<i>a "missed opportunity"</i>

766
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:08,961
<i>to learn more</i>
<i>about the Jem'Hadar.</i>

767
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:12,173
<i>However, I'm happy to report</i>
<i>that, with the boy gone,</i>

768
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:15,093
<i>life on the station</i>
<i>has returned to normal.</i>

769
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,470
(<i> buzz of conversation</i> )

770
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,059
O'BRIEN:
I think we can get
the upper sensor grid

771
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:24,936
back on line by morning.

772
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,355
SISKO:
Good. We're going to need it
in the next few days.

773
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:30,024
I thought you were going
to lower the boom
on those two.

774
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,193
Well, I was, but
some things came up

775
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:33,694
at dinner
I didn't expect.

776
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,654
Oh. Got to know her
a little better?

777
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,407
Decided you liked her
after all?

778
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,867
No, actually, I got to know
Jake a little better.

779
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:42,120
Have you ever played
dom-jot with him?

780
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,830
No.
Don't.

781
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:55,508
Major.

782
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:58,803
About the boy.

783
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:08,396
You were right.
