1
00:00:02,564 --> 00:00:03,657
What can I get for you?

2
00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:06,136
Uh, Til'amin froth
for me, please.

3
00:00:06,171 --> 00:00:07,298
Romulan ale, Quark.

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,346
A glass of spring wine.

5
00:00:11,817 --> 00:00:14,516
Since when do you drink
spring wine?

6
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,526
Or anything else,
for that matter?

7
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:17,928
It's for Kira.

8
00:00:17,965 --> 00:00:20,061
She should be getting
out of services any minute now.

9
00:00:20,102 --> 00:00:21,092
Well, here she is.

10
00:00:21,138 --> 00:00:22,231
Ah.

11
00:00:23,677 --> 00:00:24,667
How was it?

12
00:00:24,713 --> 00:00:26,046
Ah, beautiful.

13
00:00:26,082 --> 00:00:28,747
Ranjen Telna gave
a very moving sermon.

14
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:30,088
What was it about?

15
00:00:30,124 --> 00:00:32,322
About how important
it is to forgive

16
00:00:32,363 --> 00:00:34,026
the people who have wronged you.

17
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:38,099
Hmm. Two hours on forgiveness.

18
00:00:38,142 --> 00:00:40,078
It's a complicated
subject, Odo.

19
00:00:40,113 --> 00:00:41,138
Hmm...

20
00:00:41,182 --> 00:00:42,343
What's wrong?

21
00:00:42,385 --> 00:00:43,649
Nothing.

22
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,892
It's just that, uh...

23
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,923
you spend
so much time in services

24
00:00:49,968 --> 00:00:52,633
that sometimes it makes me
wish I were a believer

25
00:00:52,674 --> 00:00:54,473
so that we could go together.

26
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:56,242
That's so sweet.

27
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:58,274
I would love
for you to come with me

28
00:00:58,353 --> 00:01:00,050
but I don't think
you'll get much out of it

29
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,582
if you don't believe
in the Prophets.

30
00:01:01,627 --> 00:01:03,324
Ah.

31
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:06,234
Perhaps if I had
an Orb experience.

32
00:01:06,338 --> 00:01:07,397
It doesn't work like that.

33
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,171
Faith has to come first.

34
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:11,905
That's too bad.

35
00:01:11,949 --> 00:01:14,147
I have a feeling
it must be very comforting

36
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:17,161
to believe in something
more powerful than yourself.

37
00:01:17,195 --> 00:01:18,494
If you really feel that way

38
00:01:18,531 --> 00:01:19,726
there are other faiths.

39
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:21,760
Would it bother you
if Odo believed in...

40
00:01:21,805 --> 00:01:22,864
Klingon religion?

41
00:01:22,907 --> 00:01:25,606
Not if he got
something out of it.

42
00:01:25,647 --> 00:01:27,640
He'd get to eat
the hearts of his enemies.

43
00:01:27,684 --> 00:01:29,654
And go to <i>Sto-Vo-Kor</i>
when he dies.

44
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:31,089
You could go
on a vision quest.

45
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,286
But...

46
00:01:32,361 --> 00:01:35,801
then I wouldn't get to go to
services with Kira, would I?

47
00:01:35,836 --> 00:01:37,966
That's the whole point.

48
00:01:38,006 --> 00:01:40,033
That really is so sweet.

49
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:50,857
Yes?

50
00:01:53,474 --> 00:01:55,068
Vedek Fala.

51
00:01:56,448 --> 00:01:57,677
Nerys.

52
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:58,685
What a surprise.

53
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,846
What are you doing here?

54
00:01:59,889 --> 00:02:01,050
Well, I came to see you.

55
00:02:01,091 --> 00:02:03,289
Oh! Well, come in.
Sit down.

56
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:05,060
Let me get you some tea.

57
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,763
When I contacted the University

58
00:02:06,803 --> 00:02:08,899
they told me you were
on a spiritual retreat?

59
00:02:08,942 --> 00:02:10,309
Oh, you know me...

60
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:12,404
always searching for answers.

61
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:13,713
That's what makes you different

62
00:02:13,752 --> 00:02:15,483
from all
the other vedeks I know.

63
00:02:15,522 --> 00:02:17,219
To you, faith is a journey.

64
00:02:18,663 --> 00:02:19,892
Thank you.

65
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:21,903
And one that never ends.

66
00:02:21,937 --> 00:02:24,670
Oh, you're a Colonel now.

67
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:27,340
Seems like only yesterday
you were just a little girl

68
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:30,217
squirming in your chair
during instruction.

69
00:02:30,255 --> 00:02:32,488
We didn't have any chairs
at the camp.

70
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,691
Uh-uh. We sat on the floor.

71
00:02:34,731 --> 00:02:37,829
Huh. Which was good
for discipline

72
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:39,500
and made me seem
more imposing.

73
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:40,806
Oh, as if you needed the help.

74
00:02:40,845 --> 00:02:43,282
"Nerys, what are the three keys
to enlightenment?"

75
00:02:43,317 --> 00:02:44,376
And the answer?

76
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:47,016
Charity, humility and faith.

77
00:02:47,058 --> 00:02:48,652
You remember.

78
00:02:48,695 --> 00:02:50,392
You were a good teacher.

79
00:02:50,499 --> 00:02:53,563
Without you, I'm not sure
I would have survived that camp.

80
00:02:55,076 --> 00:02:56,568
I brought you something.

81
00:03:01,456 --> 00:03:02,720
What is it?

82
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,887
Welcome to Empok Nor.

83
00:03:31,924 --> 00:03:34,054
Empok Nor?

84
00:03:34,096 --> 00:03:35,429
That's impossible.

85
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,563
I know it's a long way
from Deep Space 9, but...

86
00:03:38,605 --> 00:03:43,571
this transponder allowed
us to beam you here.

87
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:45,279
Those red armbands...

88
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,293
you're members
of the Pah-wraith cult?

89
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:50,628
We worship the true Prophets,
yes.

90
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,031
Why did you bring me here?

91
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:54,938
Well, that is a question
best answered by the Master.

92
00:03:54,975 --> 00:03:57,036
And who exactly is the Master?

93
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,742
I am.

94
00:04:07,034 --> 00:04:08,469
Dukat.

95
00:06:09,343 --> 00:06:12,908
You? You're the leader
of the Pah-wraith cult?

96
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:15,821
I'm sure you have
many questions, Nerys

97
00:06:15,857 --> 00:06:18,522
and I intend to answer them all.

98
00:06:18,564 --> 00:06:20,329
Leave us, please?

99
00:06:25,312 --> 00:06:27,476
First of all, let me apologize

100
00:06:27,516 --> 00:06:29,042
for bringing you here

101
00:06:29,086 --> 00:06:30,315
without your permission.

102
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:31,517
Oh, it's all right.

103
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,291
I always wanted
to see Empok Nor.

104
00:06:34,332 --> 00:06:36,268
Is the Dominion aware

105
00:06:36,302 --> 00:06:39,298
that you've, uh,
set up a temple here?

106
00:06:39,343 --> 00:06:42,714
Oh, this station has been
abandoned a long time.

107
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,917
There's no reason
why they'd object

108
00:06:45,957 --> 00:06:47,620
to us putting it to use.

109
00:06:48,796 --> 00:06:51,461
Your hair... you changed it.

110
00:06:51,502 --> 00:06:54,338
Your ear... you've pierced it.

111
00:06:55,344 --> 00:06:56,437
Ah...

112
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,047
A symbol of the covenant
I've made with my new family.

113
00:07:01,124 --> 00:07:02,616
Your new family...

114
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:04,028
Well, it makes sense,
these people

115
00:07:04,063 --> 00:07:05,396
would chose you as their leader.

116
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:06,902
They worship evil.

117
00:07:06,937 --> 00:07:10,069
The Pah-wraiths are not
what you think, Nerys

118
00:07:10,177 --> 00:07:11,737
and neither am I.

119
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,576
Let me ask you something.

120
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,283
Have you ever wondered

121
00:07:16,324 --> 00:07:19,091
why the Prophets stood
by and did nothing

122
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:21,600
when Cardassia took over Bajor?

123
00:07:21,635 --> 00:07:23,696
Have you ever asked yourself

124
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,405
how they could allow your people

125
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,473
to suffer as they did?

126
00:07:28,517 --> 00:07:30,715
The Prophets
have a plan for us.

127
00:07:30,755 --> 00:07:33,124
It's not always easy
to see what it is.

128
00:07:33,227 --> 00:07:35,790
Even as you speak those words

129
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,863
you must know
how hollow they sound.

130
00:07:38,906 --> 00:07:42,004
No. There's a much
better explanation...

131
00:07:42,047 --> 00:07:45,111
one that makes perfect sense.

132
00:07:45,154 --> 00:07:48,355
The Prophets are not
the true Gods of Bajor.

133
00:07:48,394 --> 00:07:49,829
The Pah-wraiths are.

134
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:53,337
They were cast
from the Celestial Temple

135
00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:55,364
because they wanted
to take an active role

136
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,175
in Bajoran life.

137
00:07:57,213 --> 00:08:02,122
Their only crime is that they
cared about your people...

138
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:05,222
but they were not
allowed to help them

139
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:07,395
because they'd lost
the battle for heaven

140
00:08:07,436 --> 00:08:08,665
and were forced to flee.

141
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:11,142
So I guess the ancient texts
just had it all wrong, then.

142
00:08:11,178 --> 00:08:14,014
Oh, come now, Nerys.

143
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,519
You know as well as I do

144
00:08:15,554 --> 00:08:19,359
that history
is written by the victors

145
00:08:19,396 --> 00:08:21,924
but rest assured...

146
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,166
there will be another chapter.

147
00:08:24,272 --> 00:08:26,333
The Pah-wraiths are determined

148
00:08:26,377 --> 00:08:28,814
to reclaim their place
in heaven.

149
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,287
And how would you know that?

150
00:08:31,322 --> 00:08:34,818
They speak to me in visions.

151
00:08:34,863 --> 00:08:36,993
I am their Emissary.

152
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:39,767
I don't know whether you
believe what you're saying

153
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:42,301
or if you're faking it...

154
00:08:42,346 --> 00:08:44,407
or if you're just insane.

155
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:49,451
I have been touched
by the hand of a God.

156
00:08:53,136 --> 00:08:55,767
I'm a changed man.

157
00:08:55,808 --> 00:08:58,371
Oh, I admit

158
00:08:58,414 --> 00:09:00,111
that when I first allowed myself

159
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:02,178
to become a vessel
for the Pah-wraith

160
00:09:02,256 --> 00:09:06,197
it was purely out of
self-serving reasons.

161
00:09:06,232 --> 00:09:10,071
All I wanted was to help
it enter the wormhole

162
00:09:10,106 --> 00:09:12,907
so it could force
the Prophets out.

163
00:09:12,947 --> 00:09:15,180
It was nothing more than...

164
00:09:15,218 --> 00:09:19,023
a way to exact
vengeance on Sisko.

165
00:09:20,128 --> 00:09:25,538
But I had no idea the effect
it would have on me.

166
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:29,275
It was only inside of me
for a very short time...

167
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:34,350
but it opened my heart.

168
00:09:34,393 --> 00:09:39,063
Would that be before
or after you killed Jadzia?

169
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:40,437
Oh...

170
00:09:41,977 --> 00:09:44,244
That was most unfortunate...

171
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,217
but it couldn't be helped.

172
00:09:47,255 --> 00:09:49,920
The Celestial Temple
itself was at stake

173
00:09:49,961 --> 00:09:51,692
and she was in the way.

174
00:09:55,205 --> 00:09:57,642
Ah, Nerys.

175
00:09:57,678 --> 00:10:00,913
Nerys, I wish I had the words

176
00:10:00,951 --> 00:10:04,652
to describe to you
what it was like

177
00:10:04,694 --> 00:10:07,667
to have the Pah-wraith
within me.

178
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,001
I could feel its love...

179
00:10:10,038 --> 00:10:12,908
for me and for
the Bajoran people.

180
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,578
It made me realize
I still have a role to play

181
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:18,486
in Bajor's destiny.

182
00:10:18,523 --> 00:10:20,790
You mean, besides
overseeing an occupation

183
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,959
that killed tens of millions?

184
00:10:24,403 --> 00:10:26,499
You have no idea
how much it pains me

185
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:29,377
to know that I caused
so much suffering

186
00:10:29,447 --> 00:10:34,220
but I am not responsible
for the occupation.

187
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,921
The Prophets are.

188
00:10:37,832 --> 00:10:39,825
You have no right to say that.

189
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:42,638
They abandoned Bajor.

190
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:47,642
I was simply walking the path
they laid out for me.

191
00:10:47,687 --> 00:10:51,651
Now I walk
with the true Prophets.

192
00:10:56,274 --> 00:10:59,304
I'm building
a community here, Nerys.

193
00:10:59,346 --> 00:11:02,615
I brought these people
to Empok Nor

194
00:11:02,654 --> 00:11:05,627
so that we could purify
ourselves in preparation

195
00:11:05,661 --> 00:11:11,129
for the day the Pah-wraiths
reclaim the Celestial Temple.

196
00:11:11,172 --> 00:11:12,197
And what's supposed to happen

197
00:11:12,242 --> 00:11:14,178
when that day comes?

198
00:11:14,213 --> 00:11:16,080
The Pah-wraiths have a plan.

199
00:11:16,116 --> 00:11:19,887
When the time is right,
they will reveal it to me.

200
00:11:19,925 --> 00:11:21,189
Hmm.

201
00:11:21,228 --> 00:11:23,198
Something tells me
that their plan

202
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:26,137
involves you being
ruler of Bajor again.

203
00:11:26,172 --> 00:11:31,206
You're still so full
of anger toward me.

204
00:11:31,251 --> 00:11:35,283
I can only hope that, one day,
you'll let it go.

205
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,592
I brought you here
because I want you

206
00:11:39,636 --> 00:11:42,107
to be a part of our community.

207
00:11:42,141 --> 00:11:44,202
I want you to share in the love

208
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,478
these people have
for one another

209
00:11:46,584 --> 00:11:48,213
in the love they have for me.

210
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:49,883
No, they don't love you.

211
00:11:51,027 --> 00:11:53,498
You have some kind
of a hold over them

212
00:11:53,532 --> 00:11:58,305
but they don't love you.

213
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:03,150
Nerys... open your heart to me.

214
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:07,459
We're bound together
by destiny.

215
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:10,331
You belong at my side.

216
00:12:21,561 --> 00:12:22,756
Chief.

217
00:12:22,796 --> 00:12:25,165
When did you realize
she was missing?

218
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,363
This morning...
she usually comes by

219
00:12:26,405 --> 00:12:27,965
my office before going to Ops.

220
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:29,068
Did you check the entry log?

221
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:31,639
She had a visitor
sometime after 1900 hours.

222
00:12:31,683 --> 00:12:33,653
Whoever it was only stayed
about ten minutes.

223
00:12:34,757 --> 00:12:36,249
Anything, Mr. Worf?

224
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:37,921
According to the Ops report

225
00:12:37,963 --> 00:12:40,298
only one ship has left
the station since last night...

226
00:12:40,335 --> 00:12:42,499
the morning transport
to Bajor.

227
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,533
Kira was not aboard.

228
00:12:44,577 --> 00:12:47,208
Sir, I'm picking up traces
of tachyon energy.

229
00:12:47,251 --> 00:12:48,480
A transporter beam?

230
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,114
Yeah, with a Dominion signature.

231
00:12:50,157 --> 00:12:51,854
Any chance of tracing it?

232
00:12:51,894 --> 00:12:53,021
I'm afraid not.

233
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,556
The signal's already dissipated.

234
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:57,901
Their transporters operate over
longer distances than ours.

235
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,273
What's their maximum range?

236
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,508
If the homing transponder
was in place

237
00:13:01,582 --> 00:13:03,074
up to three light years.

238
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:05,522
There was
a homing transponder, all right.

239
00:13:05,558 --> 00:13:07,859
It was wrapped in this.

240
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:11,961
Three light years.

241
00:13:12,004 --> 00:13:13,097
For all we know

242
00:13:13,141 --> 00:13:16,308
she could be deep inside
Dominion space by now.

243
00:13:41,302 --> 00:13:43,830
I had a feeling you'd turn up
sooner or later.

244
00:13:43,874 --> 00:13:47,109
I know you're angry with me.

245
00:13:47,148 --> 00:13:48,879
Angry?

246
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,323
I feel sorry for you.

247
00:13:51,357 --> 00:13:56,391
Letting yourself be duped by
Dukat into joining this cult.

248
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,907
I was a member of this "cult,"
as you call it

249
00:13:58,942 --> 00:14:00,673
long before Dukat.

250
00:14:00,712 --> 00:14:01,941
I came to it

251
00:14:01,981 --> 00:14:03,780
toward the end
of the occupation.

252
00:14:05,388 --> 00:14:07,689
It's helped me make sense of...

253
00:14:07,727 --> 00:14:10,563
the suffering
we all had to endure.

254
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,829
In the camp...

255
00:14:14,609 --> 00:14:15,873
you kept us together.

256
00:14:15,912 --> 00:14:17,472
L-it was your faith
in the Prophets

257
00:14:17,515 --> 00:14:18,608
that got us through.

258
00:14:18,651 --> 00:14:21,145
How could you, of all people,
turn your back on them?

259
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:24,129
They turned their backs on us...

260
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,496
long ago.

261
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:29,199
The path the Prophets laid out
for us isn't always easy...

262
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:32,442
but that's no reason
to turn to hate and fear.

263
00:14:32,482 --> 00:14:33,951
"Hate and fear."

264
00:14:33,985 --> 00:14:37,949
You know how often I've heard
those words used to describe us?

265
00:14:37,993 --> 00:14:40,191
Nothing could be further
from the truth.

266
00:14:40,232 --> 00:14:43,033
The Pah-wraith cult
tried to kill the Emissary.

267
00:14:43,071 --> 00:14:45,167
Dukat had nothing
to do with that.

268
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:46,678
The boy who attacked
Captain Sisko

269
00:14:46,746 --> 00:14:49,411
was acting out
of his own misguided beliefs.

270
00:14:49,452 --> 00:14:51,616
We're a peaceful people.

271
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,388
Then prove it.

272
00:14:53,428 --> 00:14:54,897
Let me go.

273
00:14:54,931 --> 00:14:58,166
Nerys, the Master
brought you here

274
00:14:58,205 --> 00:15:01,144
because he cares about
your spiritual well-being.

275
00:15:01,178 --> 00:15:02,373
"The Master"!

276
00:15:02,414 --> 00:15:03,747
He's using you.

277
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,288
He's taking your beliefs

278
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:09,693
and twisting them
to suit his own purpose.

279
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:12,664
You're so stubborn.

280
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,833
That's always been your problem.

281
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,176
Your problem is
you're too trusting.

282
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,686
When Dukat first came to us

283
00:15:21,723 --> 00:15:24,958
I didn't want to accept him

284
00:15:24,997 --> 00:15:28,164
but I came to realize
the Pah-wraiths

285
00:15:28,204 --> 00:15:32,840
had taken this man of evil
and washed him clean.

286
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,544
What could be
more wondrous than that?

287
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:37,716
How can you forget

288
00:15:37,825 --> 00:15:40,319
all the friends we lost
during the occupation?

289
00:15:42,068 --> 00:15:45,337
How can you forget
all the millions Dukat murdered?

290
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,439
You disappoint me, Nerys.

291
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:51,010
Of all the things
I tried to teach you

292
00:15:51,054 --> 00:15:55,223
the most important
is the need to forgive.

293
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:01,269
Some things can't be forgiven.

294
00:16:04,517 --> 00:16:08,184
Let me show you how we live.

295
00:16:08,225 --> 00:16:11,721
I want you to see the community
we're building here

296
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,498
so you'll know you have
nothing to fear from Dukat.

297
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:16,651
Or from us.

298
00:16:31,851 --> 00:16:34,288
Only one of the fusion
generators is operational

299
00:16:34,323 --> 00:16:37,262
so we don't have power
for things like replicators.

300
00:16:37,295 --> 00:16:38,855
Where do you get your food?

301
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:40,835
We've turned several
of the lower levels

302
00:16:40,871 --> 00:16:42,602
into hydroponic bays.

303
00:16:42,641 --> 00:16:45,511
What about things like,
uh, medical supplies?

304
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,278
You bring them in from Bajor?

305
00:16:47,317 --> 00:16:49,344
We have a few cargo shuttles.

306
00:16:49,422 --> 00:16:52,155
We're well aware
that you may try and leave us

307
00:16:52,195 --> 00:16:53,356
so you should know

308
00:16:53,431 --> 00:16:56,062
that the docking bays
are being guarded

309
00:16:56,104 --> 00:16:59,909
as is the transporter
we used to bring you here.

310
00:16:59,945 --> 00:17:01,642
While we're
on the subject, am I, uh...

311
00:17:01,683 --> 00:17:03,414
free to move around,
talk to people?

312
00:17:03,453 --> 00:17:05,013
Of course.
It is the Master's hope

313
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,118
that you will come
to see this as your home.

314
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:10,065
Mika... this is Nerys.

315
00:17:10,101 --> 00:17:11,228
Welcome.

316
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,465
You're getting close.

317
00:17:12,507 --> 00:17:13,840
Could be any time now.

318
00:17:13,876 --> 00:17:16,609
Mika and her husband
have the honor

319
00:17:16,648 --> 00:17:18,174
of being the first to receive

320
00:17:18,219 --> 00:17:20,315
the Master's blessing
to bear children.

321
00:17:20,357 --> 00:17:21,621
You have to get per...

322
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:23,994
You have to get
permission from Dukat

323
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:25,192
to have a baby?

324
00:17:25,235 --> 00:17:28,800
Vows of abstinence are part
of our covenant with him.

325
00:17:28,842 --> 00:17:30,368
Exceptions are granted

326
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:32,677
only when he sees that
a husband and wife

327
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,622
have demonstrated
a true spiritual bond.

328
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:36,682
I see.

329
00:17:36,727 --> 00:17:37,991
But you don't approve.

330
00:17:39,131 --> 00:17:40,896
In ancient times,
Bajorans understood

331
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:43,932
the value of denying
worldly pleasures.

332
00:17:44,944 --> 00:17:46,413
Ironic, isn't it

333
00:17:46,447 --> 00:17:48,383
that a Cardassian
would be the one

334
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,412
to lead us back
to the old ways?

335
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,925
Especially a Cardassian

336
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,331
whose appetite for worldly
pleasures is legendary.

337
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,634
That was a long time ago...

338
00:17:57,673 --> 00:18:00,646
before he felt the kiss
of the Pah-wraith.

339
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,581
That was some kiss.

340
00:18:10,902 --> 00:18:12,303
Striking, isn't it?

341
00:18:15,545 --> 00:18:17,538
Benyan is Mika's husband.

342
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,348
Oh... congratulations.

343
00:18:19,387 --> 00:18:21,984
I understand
it isn't easy to, uh...

344
00:18:22,026 --> 00:18:24,053
get permission to have a baby.

345
00:18:24,097 --> 00:18:25,862
The Master told us

346
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,631
you wouldn't
approve of our ways.

347
00:18:27,672 --> 00:18:29,665
He said we should
be patient with you.

348
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:31,906
Don't go out of your way.

349
00:18:33,217 --> 00:18:34,880
I don't understand
why he brought you here.

350
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,446
- Benyan...
- That's all right.

351
00:18:36,524 --> 00:18:38,551
We all worked very hard
for what we have.

352
00:18:38,596 --> 00:18:40,931
We don't need you or anyone
else to approve of us.

353
00:18:40,968 --> 00:18:42,597
Fair enough.

354
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:46,106
Don't misunderstand.

355
00:18:46,146 --> 00:18:48,811
I hope you come to feel
the love of the Pah-wraiths

356
00:18:48,851 --> 00:18:51,790
but if you don't,
that's your loss.

357
00:18:51,825 --> 00:18:52,952
No offense.

358
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:53,984
None taken.

359
00:18:54,029 --> 00:18:57,902
In fact, I've always
found that, uh...

360
00:18:57,938 --> 00:19:00,136
when people try to convince
others of their beliefs

361
00:19:00,177 --> 00:19:01,372
it's because...

362
00:19:01,412 --> 00:19:03,781
they're really just trying
to convince themselves.

363
00:19:03,818 --> 00:19:06,415
I know what I believe.

364
00:19:06,457 --> 00:19:08,985
And that's what scares me.

365
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:10,760
No offense.

366
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:24,324
<i>Ba'ja kor'ek, no'la ba'lani,</i>
<i>pah'nom ko'se plusso ma'kora.</i>

367
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:27,825
<i>Ba'ja kor'ek, no'la ba'lani</i>

368
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:31,642
<i>pah'nom ko'se plusso ma'kora.</i>

369
00:19:31,678 --> 00:19:34,947
<i>Kosst no'valt Amojan,</i>
my children.

370
00:19:34,986 --> 00:19:37,287
<i>Kosst no'valt Amojan.</i>

371
00:19:37,324 --> 00:19:40,695
Let us open our hearts and pray.

372
00:19:40,732 --> 00:19:44,833
<i>Ba'ja kor'ek, no'la ba'lani,</i>

373
00:19:44,874 --> 00:19:49,179
<i>pah'nom ko'se plusso ma'kora.</i>

374
00:19:49,217 --> 00:19:58,227
<i>Ba'ja kor'ek, no'la ba'lani,</i>
<i>pah'nom ko'se plusso ma'kora.</i>

375
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,537
<i>Ba'ja kor'ek, no'la ba'lani...</i>

376
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:01,909
Don't.

377
00:20:02,948 --> 00:20:03,916
Dukat!

378
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,111
<i>... plusso...</i>

379
00:20:05,152 --> 00:20:06,416
Stay where you are.

380
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,519
The rest of you
get down on the floor.

381
00:20:10,564 --> 00:20:13,400
I said down on the floor!

382
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,115
Step aside.

383
00:20:22,156 --> 00:20:23,420
No.

384
00:20:33,782 --> 00:20:36,117
Enough, Nerys

385
00:20:36,154 --> 00:20:38,284
unless you're willing
to kill us all.

386
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,170
Now do you understand
how much they love me?

387
00:21:12,901 --> 00:21:14,302
Careful.

388
00:21:14,337 --> 00:21:15,236
No sudden moves.

389
00:21:24,594 --> 00:21:28,831
I removed it
so I could tend to your bruise.

390
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,277
I had a meal prepared for you.

391
00:21:41,431 --> 00:21:43,732
Oh, come now, Nerys...

392
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:47,368
you haven't eaten anything
since you arrived.

393
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:53,048
I know what you're thinking...

394
00:21:55,127 --> 00:21:56,926
but really...

395
00:21:56,964 --> 00:22:00,267
what good would it do
to try to kill me?

396
00:22:00,305 --> 00:22:01,706
Even if you succeeded

397
00:22:01,741 --> 00:22:04,076
it wouldn't get
you off Empok Nor.

398
00:22:04,113 --> 00:22:06,516
You'd only make a martyr of me.

399
00:22:06,552 --> 00:22:08,921
You're right.

400
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:12,659
I don't want anything
to happen to you...

401
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:14,168
not until your followers

402
00:22:14,202 --> 00:22:16,730
have a chance to see
what a fraud you are.

403
00:22:16,808 --> 00:22:20,043
I love these people, Nerys

404
00:22:20,082 --> 00:22:23,112
and they love me.

405
00:22:23,155 --> 00:22:25,888
I should think
that after what just happened

406
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,591
in the temple,
you'd realize that.

407
00:22:27,632 --> 00:22:30,433
It always comes back to that,
doesn't it, Dukat?

408
00:22:30,472 --> 00:22:31,531
Your desperate need

409
00:22:31,574 --> 00:22:33,738
to win the love of
the Bajoran people.

410
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:36,580
You just never understood
why we didn't appreciate you.

411
00:22:37,922 --> 00:22:39,915
If it hadn't been for me

412
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:42,556
the occupation would
have been much worse.

413
00:22:42,598 --> 00:22:44,568
And you want a "thank you"?

414
00:22:47,676 --> 00:22:51,742
You were working people to death
in the Ore Processing Center

415
00:22:51,785 --> 00:22:54,382
but that didn't stop you
from strutting around Terok Nor

416
00:22:54,424 --> 00:22:56,485
picking out Bajoran women
to take to your bed

417
00:22:56,529 --> 00:22:59,502
and actually believing
that they wanted to be there.

418
00:22:59,535 --> 00:23:02,405
You mother did want to be there.

419
00:23:02,442 --> 00:23:04,503
You took her away
from her children.

420
00:23:04,546 --> 00:23:08,145
She did what she had to do
so that we could survive.

421
00:23:08,188 --> 00:23:09,782
She loved me.

422
00:23:09,825 --> 00:23:13,560
Maybe... she convinced herself
that she did

423
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:15,934
which is a very different thing.

424
00:23:19,245 --> 00:23:21,306
Perhaps you're right.

425
00:23:23,822 --> 00:23:26,225
And if I did, indeed

426
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,702
cause your mother any pain...

427
00:23:30,737 --> 00:23:33,801
I deeply regret it

428
00:23:33,844 --> 00:23:37,842
just as I regret many things
I did in those years.

429
00:23:37,886 --> 00:23:39,822
That's why I'm so glad

430
00:23:39,857 --> 00:23:42,658
the Pah-wraiths
have given me an opportunity

431
00:23:42,697 --> 00:23:45,670
to redeem myself
in the eyes of your people.

432
00:23:45,704 --> 00:23:47,173
How?

433
00:23:47,207 --> 00:23:48,197
By recreating some kind

434
00:23:48,242 --> 00:23:49,973
of idealized version
of the occupation?

435
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,812
'Cause that's what
you've done here.

436
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,581
You have your station back

437
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,023
Bajorans to serve
your every whim

438
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,189
and the best part is,
this time...

439
00:23:58,231 --> 00:24:00,725
they really do love you.

440
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,141
As misguided as that is...

441
00:24:04,177 --> 00:24:06,580
they love you.

442
00:24:06,616 --> 00:24:09,714
I'm so glad you're here, Nerys.

443
00:24:12,662 --> 00:24:18,004
You embody everything
I most admire

444
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,604
about the Bajoran people.

445
00:24:22,049 --> 00:24:23,348
Your passion...

446
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:26,859
your spirit...

447
00:24:28,397 --> 00:24:31,893
I can see now
why the Pah-wraiths want you

448
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,497
at my side.

449
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:35,171
And why is that?

450
00:24:35,212 --> 00:24:38,116
Because if I can open
your heart to them

451
00:24:38,152 --> 00:24:43,095
then surely I can
open the heart of any Bajoran.

452
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:46,661
Your anger is a challenge.

453
00:24:46,704 --> 00:24:48,731
I welcome it.

454
00:24:48,775 --> 00:24:53,217
Because, in the end, it will
only help me better serve

455
00:24:53,252 --> 00:24:54,949
the Pah-wraiths.

456
00:24:55,056 --> 00:24:56,992
Yes.

457
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,197
It's Mika.
She's gone into labor.

458
00:25:01,236 --> 00:25:03,069
Come, Nerys.

459
00:25:03,107 --> 00:25:06,808
I want you to be a witness
at this blessed event.

460
00:25:22,616 --> 00:25:24,449
Ah...

461
00:25:24,487 --> 00:25:27,483
this is a great day for us,
Benyan.

462
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:29,725
You should be honored
to have fathered

463
00:25:29,766 --> 00:25:32,739
the first child born
to our community.

464
00:25:32,772 --> 00:25:34,537
I only hope that Mika
and I can live up

465
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:35,736
to the faith
you've shown in us.

466
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:37,875
Oh, I have no doubt
that you will.

467
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:41,356
Your family will be
the first of many.

468
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,619
Think of it.

469
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:47,501
Someday, Empok Nor will ring
with the laughter of children.

470
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:51,011
You don't approve, Nerys.

471
00:25:51,045 --> 00:25:53,015
Children being raised
to follow the Pah-wraiths?

472
00:25:53,117 --> 00:25:54,312
You can bet I don't approve.

473
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:56,722
This is a special moment.

474
00:25:56,758 --> 00:25:59,457
I'm not going to ruin it
by arguing with you.

475
00:25:59,497 --> 00:26:02,128
You believe the Prophets
are the true Gods of Bajor.

476
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:03,695
I believe the Pah-wraiths are.

477
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,573
Let's just leave it at that.

478
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,578
I'd be happy to.

479
00:26:06,613 --> 00:26:08,640
There's just one thing...
we can't both be right.

480
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:37,129
The Pah-wraiths...

481
00:26:37,174 --> 00:26:40,010
they've sent us a sign.

482
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,717
My children, good news.

483
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,323
Something wondrous has happened.

484
00:26:48,366 --> 00:26:51,065
This infant...

485
00:26:51,105 --> 00:26:55,376
born of the love
between Benyan and Mika

486
00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:59,583
was transformed in her womb
into a living symbol

487
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,660
of the covenant I made with you.

488
00:27:01,695 --> 00:27:04,668
Oh, what a blessed day this is.

489
00:27:04,701 --> 00:27:07,172
There can no longer be any doubt

490
00:27:07,207 --> 00:27:11,080
that the Pah-wraiths
are smiling upon us.

491
00:27:11,115 --> 00:27:15,557
Let us give thanks and praise.

492
00:27:15,658 --> 00:27:17,025
<i>Kosst Amojan pur-ono.</i>

493
00:27:17,062 --> 00:27:19,089
<i>Ka'li bor'ek, no'ma</i>

494
00:27:19,133 --> 00:27:22,402
<i>ten'su, fah-jah nori bentu'sa.</i>

495
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:29,822
<i>Ka'li bor'ek, no'ma ten'su,</i>
<i>fah-jah nori bentu'sa.</i>

496
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:33,296
<i>Ka'li bor'ek, no'ma ten'su</i>

497
00:27:33,331 --> 00:27:37,295
<i>fah-jah nori bentu'sa.</i>

498
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:39,332
<i>Ka'li bor'ek...</i>

499
00:27:47,996 --> 00:27:50,365
Fala, I don't understand this.

500
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,498
You're an intelligent man.

501
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,533
How can you believe
Dukat's story?

502
00:27:54,578 --> 00:27:56,309
It's obvious he's
the child's father.

503
00:27:58,353 --> 00:28:01,292
What's obvious is
you hate him so much

504
00:28:01,326 --> 00:28:03,228
you can't even entertain
the possibility

505
00:28:03,263 --> 00:28:05,598
that a miracle has occurred.

506
00:28:05,635 --> 00:28:08,870
Are you so blind that
you will just believe

507
00:28:08,909 --> 00:28:10,104
anything he says?

508
00:28:14,588 --> 00:28:16,524
I have faith.

509
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,124
I would think you'd understand
what that means.

510
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:22,570
Nerys, is it beyond
the realm of possibility

511
00:28:22,606 --> 00:28:26,068
that the Pah-wraiths have
sent us this child as a sign?

512
00:28:26,114 --> 00:28:29,087
They have powers
beyond our understanding.

513
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,353
Your Prophets made
an entire fleet

514
00:28:31,392 --> 00:28:33,886
of Dominion ships
vanish into thin air.

515
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:36,458
What's one child compared
to a miracle like that?

516
00:28:36,503 --> 00:28:39,476
You want to know
what the real miracle is?

517
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,674
That Mika didn't break into
tears in front of her husband.

518
00:28:41,748 --> 00:28:43,149
She was terrified

519
00:28:43,184 --> 00:28:45,485
he wasn't going to believe
Dukat's little performance.

520
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:46,684
I could see it in her eyes.

521
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:48,890
You saw what you wanted to see.

522
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,405
If you believe that
this really is a miracle

523
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:56,004
then you'll let me talk
to the happy couple.

524
00:28:57,983 --> 00:28:59,384
Oh, what's wrong?

525
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,789
Afraid of finding out the truth?

526
00:29:03,796 --> 00:29:06,131
I know the truth.

527
00:29:06,168 --> 00:29:10,041
I just don't want you
making unfounded accusations.

528
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,977
I'll be discreet.

529
00:29:18,662 --> 00:29:21,463
Oh, it's coming along nicely.

530
00:29:21,502 --> 00:29:22,595
Maybe you should make

531
00:29:22,638 --> 00:29:24,631
one of the children
half Cardassian...

532
00:29:24,675 --> 00:29:26,372
to commemorate what happened.

533
00:29:26,412 --> 00:29:28,075
If I'd known, I would have.

534
00:29:28,116 --> 00:29:29,949
Must be quite an honor
to be part

535
00:29:29,987 --> 00:29:32,048
of such a miraculous event.

536
00:29:32,092 --> 00:29:33,060
It is.

537
00:29:33,094 --> 00:29:35,292
Obviously, Dukat
did the right thing

538
00:29:35,332 --> 00:29:37,565
in giving his permission
for you to have a baby.

539
00:29:37,604 --> 00:29:39,734
We prayed together many times.

540
00:29:39,775 --> 00:29:41,540
He wanted to be sure.

541
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:43,743
Did you ever pray
with him alone?

542
00:29:43,784 --> 00:29:44,877
Yes.

543
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,389
Did Mika?

544
00:29:50,866 --> 00:29:52,233
Yes.

545
00:29:52,269 --> 00:29:54,866
Nerys...

546
00:29:54,908 --> 00:29:56,810
let's let Benyan
get back to work.

547
00:30:04,195 --> 00:30:05,562
I want to find Mika.

548
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:06,589
When we do

549
00:30:06,634 --> 00:30:08,160
I trust you'll be more discreet

550
00:30:08,204 --> 00:30:09,605
than you were with Benyan.

551
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:27,208
I'm sorry.

552
00:30:27,246 --> 00:30:29,843
Why didn't you tell me
the baby was mine?

553
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:30,978
I didn't know.

554
00:30:31,022 --> 00:30:33,323
I was hoping it wasn't.

555
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,298
Oh, Mika, I'm so sorry
about what happened

556
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:37,768
that night.

557
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:39,670
I was weak...

558
00:30:39,707 --> 00:30:42,839
and you were so beautiful.

559
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:44,407
I've forgiven you.

560
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:45,886
You know that.

561
00:30:45,954 --> 00:30:47,685
Have you told anyone?

562
00:30:47,725 --> 00:30:49,217
No.

563
00:30:49,261 --> 00:30:50,992
Not even Benyan?

564
00:30:52,034 --> 00:30:54,004
He wants to believe
it was a miracle

565
00:30:54,038 --> 00:30:56,065
but I know he has doubts.

566
00:30:56,677 --> 00:30:59,547
If he ever asks me...

567
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:02,488
I don't know
if I can lie to him.

568
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,389
Thank you.

569
00:31:06,432 --> 00:31:07,627
He said Mika went this way.

570
00:31:09,873 --> 00:31:11,240
Don't worry.

571
00:31:11,276 --> 00:31:14,077
Everything is going
to be all right.

572
00:31:14,116 --> 00:31:15,779
Wait here until I'm gone

573
00:31:15,819 --> 00:31:17,345
then go back to your quarters

574
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:20,191
and pray... for strength.

575
00:32:09,905 --> 00:32:11,431
Mika?

576
00:32:11,475 --> 00:32:12,443
Mika.

577
00:32:20,362 --> 00:32:21,387
Mika...

578
00:32:32,889 --> 00:32:35,053
You got to her just in time.

579
00:32:38,802 --> 00:32:40,465
How is she?

580
00:32:40,506 --> 00:32:42,476
The depressurization
caused swelling

581
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,104
in her meningeal tissues.

582
00:32:44,147 --> 00:32:46,414
I'm going to keep her
sedated until morning.

583
00:32:46,452 --> 00:32:48,445
But she will recover.

584
00:32:48,489 --> 00:32:50,186
She'll be fine.

585
00:32:51,196 --> 00:32:52,186
Brin...

586
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,398
seal the Docking Ring,
check all the airlocks.

587
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:57,842
Let's make sure we never have

588
00:32:57,877 --> 00:32:59,540
another accident
like this again.

589
00:32:59,581 --> 00:33:00,571
An accident?

590
00:33:01,518 --> 00:33:02,953
What happened, Dukat?

591
00:33:02,989 --> 00:33:04,390
Was Mika going to tell everyone

592
00:33:04,424 --> 00:33:05,688
that you're the father
of her child?

593
00:33:05,728 --> 00:33:06,696
Kira...

594
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:07,698
Is that why you
tried to kill her?

595
00:33:07,732 --> 00:33:08,722
Enough.

596
00:33:08,768 --> 00:33:10,499
Fala, it's all right.

597
00:33:10,538 --> 00:33:11,699
Nerys is obviously upset.

598
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:14,008
She doesn't know
what she's saying.

599
00:33:14,046 --> 00:33:16,244
Mika isn't going
to lie for you anymore.

600
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,518
Take her to her quarters.

601
00:33:18,555 --> 00:33:20,286
She needs to rest.

602
00:33:22,331 --> 00:33:23,800
Keep him away from her.

603
00:33:28,077 --> 00:33:31,539
Let us all pray
for Mika's recovery.

604
00:33:31,584 --> 00:33:35,457
<i>Ka'la mo'sek</i>
<i>teru-benso, Kosst Amojan...</i>

605
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:42,498
I failed you.

606
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,250
Forgive my weakness.

607
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,887
Forgive me
for letting temptation

608
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:55,130
obscure the path
you laid out for me.

609
00:33:57,508 --> 00:34:01,347
When Mika awakes...
and I pray she does...

610
00:34:03,454 --> 00:34:05,948
your children will learn
the truth.

611
00:34:08,098 --> 00:34:10,592
They will turn away from me.

612
00:34:10,637 --> 00:34:14,408
They will turn away from you.

613
00:34:14,445 --> 00:34:18,443
The covenant will be broken.

614
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:22,652
Don't let that happen.

615
00:34:22,696 --> 00:34:26,501
Tell me what to do.

616
00:34:27,975 --> 00:34:29,274
Please.

617
00:34:33,253 --> 00:34:36,317
Please.

618
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:45,346
It's not time for services.

619
00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:47,008
I'll stay with her
if you want to go.

620
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:48,781
No. You go.

621
00:35:05,123 --> 00:35:08,426
<i>Kosst no'valt Amojan,</i>
my children.

622
00:35:08,464 --> 00:35:10,662
<i>Kosst no'valt Amojan.</i>

623
00:35:10,702 --> 00:35:13,903
Tonight, as I prayed

624
00:35:13,943 --> 00:35:17,144
the Pah-wraiths sent me
a vision.

625
00:35:17,217 --> 00:35:19,848
They told me
it would be the last one

626
00:35:19,889 --> 00:35:21,859
I'd ever receive from them.

627
00:35:24,132 --> 00:35:25,931
There's a reason...

628
00:35:25,969 --> 00:35:28,566
a wondrous reason.

629
00:35:28,608 --> 00:35:33,313
My children, the Pah-wraiths
have asked us to join them

630
00:35:33,352 --> 00:35:38,057
in their holy quest
to reclaim the Celestial Temple.

631
00:35:38,096 --> 00:35:41,661
To become warriors
in this great battle

632
00:35:41,704 --> 00:35:44,198
we must transform ourselves.

633
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:47,874
Our corporeal bodies are
not suitable for the task

634
00:35:47,917 --> 00:35:50,081
so we must leave them behind.

635
00:35:50,122 --> 00:35:52,593
In a few hours

636
00:35:52,628 --> 00:35:57,367
at the beginning of a new day,
we will gather together here

637
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,842
for the last time.

638
00:35:59,877 --> 00:36:04,752
We will shed the flesh
that ties us to this world

639
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:06,050
and deliver ourselves

640
00:36:06,182 --> 00:36:10,749
into the waiting arms
of the Pah-wraiths.

641
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:13,629
<i>Ka'li bor'ek, no'ma ten'su</i>

642
00:36:13,665 --> 00:36:16,934
<i>fah-jah nori bentu'sa.</i>

643
00:36:16,973 --> 00:36:22,680
<i>Ka'li bor'ek, no'ma ten'su,</i>
<i>fah-jah nori bentu'sa.</i>

644
00:36:22,752 --> 00:36:26,989
<i>Ka'li bor'ek, no'ma ten'su</i>

645
00:36:27,028 --> 00:36:30,160
<i>fah-jah nori bentu'sa.</i>

646
00:36:30,202 --> 00:36:36,547
<i>Ka'li bor'ek, no'ma ten'su,</i>
<i>fah-jah nori bentu'sa.</i>

647
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,675
I've sent a message
to Deep Space 9.

648
00:36:49,711 --> 00:36:52,342
They should be able
to have someone here for you

649
00:36:52,384 --> 00:36:54,354
within a day or so.

650
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,549
I know you're desperate

651
00:36:56,594 --> 00:36:58,427
to keep your followers
from turning against you.

652
00:36:58,464 --> 00:37:00,331
I'm not surprised
you'd kill them

653
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:04,405
but I can't believe you'd
be willing to die yourself.

654
00:37:06,114 --> 00:37:11,319
You just don't understand,
Nerys.

655
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,026
The Pah-wraiths
are calling me home.

656
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:16,194
You should be happy.

657
00:37:16,236 --> 00:37:17,204
Happy?

658
00:37:17,238 --> 00:37:19,402
50 people are going to die.

659
00:37:20,445 --> 00:37:23,941
I assure you our deaths...

660
00:37:23,987 --> 00:37:26,891
will be painless.

661
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:31,168
Promazine...

662
00:37:31,202 --> 00:37:33,696
developed by the Obsidian Order

663
00:37:33,741 --> 00:37:37,580
for use by their operatives
in case of capture.

664
00:37:37,617 --> 00:37:40,088
Not only is death swift

665
00:37:40,122 --> 00:37:43,459
but it reduces the body to dust
within hours

666
00:37:43,496 --> 00:37:46,765
making it unidentifiable
to the enemy.

667
00:37:49,543 --> 00:37:51,035
Dust...

668
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:56,814
that's all that will remain

669
00:37:56,859 --> 00:38:02,304
of my passage through this
misbegotten universe, Nerys

670
00:38:02,338 --> 00:38:07,372
but it doesn't bother me

671
00:38:07,416 --> 00:38:11,915
because I know I'm going to be
with the Pah-wraiths.

672
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,941
You really believe that.

673
00:38:25,588 --> 00:38:27,786
Good-bye, Nerys.

674
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,860
My children...

675
00:39:16,968 --> 00:39:21,741
the time has come for us
to leave this world behind us.

676
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,689
As we embark on this journey

677
00:39:42,725 --> 00:39:46,564
our hearts are not heavy,
but joyful

678
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,767
because we know
we'll be together

679
00:39:49,807 --> 00:39:53,212
in the holy light
of the Pah-wraiths.

680
00:39:53,247 --> 00:39:56,414
This is a great day for us.

681
00:39:56,455 --> 00:40:00,156
We have proven ourselves worthy
of the Pah-wraiths

682
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:03,602
and they are calling us home.

683
00:40:03,638 --> 00:40:09,140
This is the means
of our deliverance.

684
00:40:09,183 --> 00:40:12,679
<i>Kosst no'valt Amojan,</i>
my children.

685
00:40:12,724 --> 00:40:14,751
<i>Kosst no'valt Amojan.</i>

686
00:40:14,795 --> 00:40:16,697
Be not afraid.

687
00:40:16,733 --> 00:40:18,635
I love you all.

688
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:21,635
Dukat!

689
00:40:22,546 --> 00:40:24,209
Oh, no! Stop her!

690
00:40:31,532 --> 00:40:34,003
Don't you see
why he's doing this?

691
00:40:34,037 --> 00:40:36,508
He doesn't want you
to find out the truth.

692
00:40:46,198 --> 00:40:47,724
Are you all right?

693
00:40:49,505 --> 00:40:51,498
Everyone, please...

694
00:40:51,542 --> 00:40:53,068
let us not allow
anything to disturb

695
00:40:53,146 --> 00:40:54,615
this holy moment.

696
00:41:03,436 --> 00:41:04,700
What's wrong, Dukat?

697
00:41:05,975 --> 00:41:07,136
Take it.

698
00:41:08,447 --> 00:41:10,041
They're all the same,
aren't they?

699
00:41:13,925 --> 00:41:16,761
My children, listen to me.

700
00:41:16,799 --> 00:41:18,268
Tell them, Dukat.

701
00:41:18,301 --> 00:41:20,066
Tell them you never
had any intention

702
00:41:20,173 --> 00:41:21,141
of dying with them.

703
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:26,910
My time here is not finished.

704
00:41:26,954 --> 00:41:29,755
The Pah-wraiths want me
to continue bringing others

705
00:41:29,793 --> 00:41:31,160
into their light.

706
00:41:35,974 --> 00:41:38,104
This is his child.

707
00:41:38,145 --> 00:41:41,710
That's why you tried
to kill Mika!

708
00:41:41,753 --> 00:41:44,520
The Pah-wraiths
have forgiven my sins.

709
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:46,028
They've given me
their absolution.

710
00:41:49,537 --> 00:41:52,669
Who are you to presume
they're wrong?

711
00:41:52,711 --> 00:41:54,807
Who are you to judge me?!

712
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,987
You've been making us fools
this whole time!

713
00:42:01,429 --> 00:42:02,728
Liar!

714
00:42:04,403 --> 00:42:06,373
Then it's done.

715
00:42:06,407 --> 00:42:10,108
Our covenant... is broken!

716
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:16,520
None of you will ever know
the love of the Pah-wraiths...

717
00:42:16,562 --> 00:42:19,363
none of you!

718
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:22,037
False Gods!

719
00:42:37,977 --> 00:42:38,910
Fala, no!

720
00:42:45,626 --> 00:42:47,220
Why?

721
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:53,068
Faith... Nerys...

722
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,616
faith.

723
00:43:07,574 --> 00:43:09,875
I'm sorry about Vedek Fala.

724
00:43:09,913 --> 00:43:13,409
I keep going over what he
said when he died, and...

725
00:43:13,454 --> 00:43:15,151
and I don't know if he
was trying to tell me

726
00:43:15,191 --> 00:43:17,287
that he never lost his faith

727
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:18,923
or he felt betrayed by it.

728
00:43:18,966 --> 00:43:21,369
I suppose you'll never know...

729
00:43:21,405 --> 00:43:23,899
but one thing is certain.

730
00:43:23,944 --> 00:43:26,575
These people have been betrayed
and now they have to find a way

731
00:43:26,616 --> 00:43:29,019
to pick up the pieces
and move on.

732
00:43:29,055 --> 00:43:32,153
I thought Dukat was just
claiming to share their faith

733
00:43:32,196 --> 00:43:33,961
because he wanted
them to love him

734
00:43:33,999 --> 00:43:36,095
but it was more than that.

735
00:43:36,138 --> 00:43:37,903
He's changed.

736
00:43:37,942 --> 00:43:41,438
If you hadn't stopped him,
he would've killed them all

737
00:43:41,483 --> 00:43:44,353
and nobody would've known his
body wasn't among the remains.

738
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:46,484
That sounds like
the same old Dukat to me.

739
00:43:46,527 --> 00:43:48,862
I know this is going
to sound crazy...

740
00:43:48,899 --> 00:43:51,462
but I think Dukat
convinced himself

741
00:43:51,505 --> 00:43:54,102
that he was doing what
the Pah-wraiths wanted.

742
00:43:55,714 --> 00:43:57,149
Who knows?

743
00:43:57,184 --> 00:43:58,813
Maybe he was.

744
00:43:58,854 --> 00:44:01,018
Either way, he believes

745
00:44:01,058 --> 00:44:03,997
and that makes him more
dangerous than ever.
