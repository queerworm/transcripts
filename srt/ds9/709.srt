1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,378
What can I get for you?

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:05,756
Uh, Til'amin froth
for me, please.

3
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:06,924
Romulan ale, Quark.

4
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,969
A glass of spring wine.

5
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:14,181
Since when do<i> you</i> drink
spring wine?

6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,850
Or anything else,
for that matter?

7
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,601
It's for Kira.

8
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:19,770
She should be getting
out of services
any minute now.

9
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,813
Well, here she is.

10
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:22,063
Ah.

11
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:24,358
How was it?

12
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,818
Ah, beautiful.

13
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:28,278
Ranjen Telna gave
a very moving sermon.

14
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,864
What was it about?

15
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:31,907
About how important
it is to forgive

16
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,868
the people who
have wronged you.

17
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:37,663
Hmm. Two hours
on forgiveness.

18
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,748
It's a complicated
subject, Odo. 

19
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,000
Hmm...

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,001
What's wrong?

21
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:43,210
Nothing.

22
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,715
It's just that, uh...

23
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,717
you spend
so much time in services

24
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:52,219
that sometimes it makes me
wish I were a believer

25
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,095
so that we could
go together.

26
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,806
That's so sweet.

27
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:58,017
I would love
for you to come with me

28
00:00:58,017 --> 00:00:59,727
but I don't think
you'll get much out of it

29
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,228
if you don't believe
in the Prophets.

30
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,897
Ah.

31
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:05,900
Perhaps if I had
an Orb experience.

32
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,026
It doesn't work like that.

33
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:08,903
Faith has to come first.

34
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:11,697
That's too bad.

35
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,908
I have a feeling
it must be very comforting

36
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:16,660
to believe in something
more powerful than yourself.

37
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,995
If you really
feel that way

38
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,287
there are other faiths.

39
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,164
Would it bother you
if Odo believed in...

40
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,416
Klingon religion?

41
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:25,084
Not if he got
something out of it.

42
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:27,128
He'd get to eat the
hearts of his enemies.

43
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,172
And go to<i> Sto-Vo-Kor</i> 
when he dies.

44
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,340
BASHIR:
You could go
on a vision quest.

45
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,091
(<i> sighs</i> ):
But...

46
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:35,387
then I wouldn't get to go to
services with Kira, would I?

47
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,347
That's the whole point.

48
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,516
That really is so sweet.

49
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,518
(<i> laughing</i> )

50
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,150
(<i> door chimes</i> )

51
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,318
Yes?

52
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:54,531
Vedek Fala.

53
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,242
Nerys.

54
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,243
What a surprise.

55
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,369
What are you doing here?

56
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,704
Well, I came
to see you.

57
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,831
Oh! Well, come in.
Sit down.

58
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,416
Let me get you some tea.

59
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,251
When I contacted the University

60
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,253
they told me you were
on a spiritual retreat?

61
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,880
Oh, you know me--

62
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,966
always searching for answers.

63
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,216
That's what makes you different

64
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,969
from all
the other vedeks I know.

65
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,845
To you, faith is a journey.

66
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,431
Thank you.

67
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,433
And one that never ends.

68
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,185
Oh, you're a Colonel now.

69
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,897
Seems like only yesterday
you were just a little girl

70
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,817
squirming in your chair
during instruction.

71
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,902
We didn't have any
chairs at the camp.

72
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,154
Uh-uh. We sat
on the floor.

73
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,324
Huh. Which was good
for discipline

74
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,951
and made me seem
more imposing.

75
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:40,452
Oh, as if you needed the help.

76
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:42,788
"Nerys, what are the three keys
to enlightenment?"

77
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:43,872
And the answer?

78
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,500
Charity, humility and faith.

79
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,167
You remember.

80
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,087
You were a good teacher.

81
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,965
Without you, I'm not sure
I would have survived that camp.

82
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,968
I brought you something.

83
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,099
What is it?

84
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:31,336
Welcome to
Empok Nor.

85
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,130
Empok Nor?

86
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,756
That's impossible.

87
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:38,177
I know it's a long way
from Deep Space 9, but...

88
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:43,015
this transponder allowed
us to beam you here.

89
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:44,892
Those red armbands--

90
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,811
you're members
of the Pah-wraith cult?

91
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,938
We worship the true
Prophets, yes.

92
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,481
Why did you bring me here?

93
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,359
Well, that is a question
best answered by the Master.

94
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,319
And who exactly is the Master?

95
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,072
MALE:
I am.

96
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:07,956
Dukat.

97
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,623
You? You're the leader
of the Pah-wraith cult?

98
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,668
I'm sure you have
many questions, Nerys

99
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:19,129
and I intend to answer them all.

100
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,256
Leave us, please?

101
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,055
First of all, let me apologize

102
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,806
for bringing you here

103
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,099
without your
permission.

104
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,475
Oh, it's all right.

105
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,062
I always wanted
to see Empok Nor.

106
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,980
Is the Dominion aware

107
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,983
that you've, uh,
set up a temple here?

108
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:43,611
Oh, this station has been
abandoned a long time.

109
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:46,614
There's no reason
why they'd object

110
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,325
to us putting
it to use.

111
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,204
Your hair-- you changed it.

112
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:55,040
Your ear-- you've pierced it.

113
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,542
Ah...

114
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:01,880
A symbol of the covenant
I've made with my new family.

115
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,382
Your new family...

116
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:04,758
Well, it makes sense,
these people

117
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:05,967
would chose you
as their leader.

118
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,594
They worship evil.

119
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,931
The Pah-wraiths are not
what you think, Nerys

120
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,432
and neither am I.

121
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,767
(<i> laughing</i> )

122
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,143
Let me ask you something.

123
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,937
Have you ever wondered

124
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,814
why the Prophets stood
by and did nothing

125
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,442
when Cardassia
took over Bajor?

126
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,527
Have you ever
asked yourself

127
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,114
how they could
allow your people

128
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,157
to suffer as they did?

129
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,368
The Prophets
have a plan for us.

130
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,578
It's not always easy
to see what it is.

131
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,373
Even as you
speak those words

132
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,542
you must know how
hollow they sound.

133
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,379
No. There's a much
better explanation--

134
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:45,715
one that makes
perfect sense.

135
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,094
The Prophets are not
the true Gods of Bajor.

136
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,387
The Pah-wraiths are.

137
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,721
(<i> laughing</i> )

138
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,932
They were cast from
the Celestial Temple

139
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,101
because they wanted
to take an active role

140
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,978
in Bajoran life.

141
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:02,774
Their only crime is that they
cared about your people...

142
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,819
but they were not
allowed to help them

143
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,946
because they'd lost
the battle for heaven

144
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,530
and were forced to flee.

145
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,825
So I guess the ancient texts
just had it all wrong, then.

146
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,702
Oh, come now, Nerys.

147
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,288
You know as well as I do

148
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:20,041
that history
is written by the victors

149
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,627
but rest assured...

150
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,879
there will be another chapter.

151
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,965
The Pah-wraiths
are determined

152
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,384
to reclaim their place
in heaven.

153
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,928
And how would
you know that?

154
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:35,515
They speak to me
in visions.

155
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,517
I am their Emissary.

156
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,395
I don't know whether you
believe what you're saying

157
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,981
or if you're faking it...

158
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,983
or if you're just insane.

159
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:49,988
I have been touched
by the hand of a God.

160
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,370
I'm a changed man.

161
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,913
Oh, I admit

162
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,581
that when I first
allowed myself

163
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,750
to become a vessel
for the Pah-wraith

164
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,796
it was purely out of
self-serving reasons.

165
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:10,591
All I wanted was to help
it enter the wormhole

166
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,428
so it could force
the Prophets out.

167
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,680
It was nothing
more than...

168
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,643
a way to exact
vengeance on Sisko.

169
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:26,107
But I had no idea the effect
it would have on me.

170
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,777
It was only inside of me
for a very short time...

171
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,908
but it opened my heart.

172
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:39,662
Would that be before
or after you killed Jadzia?

173
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,914
Oh...

174
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,709
That was most
unfortunate...

175
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,754
but it couldn't
be helped.

176
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,465
The Celestial Temple
itself was at stake

177
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,008
and she was in the way.

178
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,676
(<i> laughing</i> )

179
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,098
Ah, Nerys.

180
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:01,435
Nerys, I wish
I had the words

181
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:05,188
to describe to you
what it was like

182
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:08,149
to have the Pah-wraith
within me.

183
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,527
I could<i> feel</i> its love...

184
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,613
for me and for
the Bajoran people.

185
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:17,117
It made me realize
I still have a role to play

186
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,993
in Bajor's destiny.

187
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,413
You mean, besides
overseeing an occupation

188
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,582
that killed
tens of millions?

189
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,001
You have no idea
how much it pains me

190
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,921
to know that I caused
so much suffering

191
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:34,759
but I am not responsible
for the occupation.

192
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,344
The Prophets are.

193
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,140
You have no right
to say that.

194
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,101
They abandoned Bajor.

195
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:48,148
I was simply walking the path
they laid out for me.

196
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:52,068
Now I walk
with the true Prophets.

197
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,784
I'm building
a community here, Nerys.

198
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:03,079
I brought these people
to Empok Nor

199
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,082
so that we could purify
ourselves in preparation

200
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:11,505
for the day the Pah-wraiths
reclaim the Celestial Temple.

201
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:12,589
And what's supposed
to happen

202
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,633
when<i> that</i> day comes?

203
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,717
The Pah-wraiths
have a plan.

204
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:20,180
When the time is right,
they will reveal it to me.

205
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,640
Hmm.

206
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,724
Something tells me
that their plan

207
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,769
involves you being
ruler of Bajor again.

208
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:31,816
You're still so full
of anger toward me.

209
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:35,820
I can only hope that, one day,
you'll let it go.

210
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,991
I brought you here
because I want you

211
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,494
to be a part
of our community.

212
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:44,621
I want you
to share in the love

213
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,956
these people have
for one another

214
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,542
in the love
they have for me.

215
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,210
No, they don't
love you.

216
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,921
You have some kind
of a hold over them

217
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:58,677
but they don't love you.

218
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:03,515
Nerys... open
your heart to me.

219
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:07,894
We're bound together
by destiny.

220
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,647
You belong at my side.

221
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,159
Chief.

222
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,537
When did you realize
she was missing?

223
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:26,745
This morning--
she usually comes by

224
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,039
my office before
going to Ops.

225
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,457
Did you check
the entry log?

226
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,210
She had a visitor
sometime after 1900 hours.

227
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,961
Whoever it was only stayed
about ten minutes.

228
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,631
Anything,
Mr. Worf?

229
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,425
According to the Ops report

230
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,594
only one ship has left
the station since last night--

231
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,970
the morning transport
to Bajor.

232
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,056
Kira was<i> not</i> aboard.

233
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,601
Sir, I'm picking
up traces of
tachyon energy.

234
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:48,851
A transporter beam?

235
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,478
Yeah, with a
Dominion signature.

236
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,146
Any chance
of tracing it?

237
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,398
I'm afraid not.

238
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,149
The signal's
already dissipated.

239
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,152
Their transporters
operate over longer
distances than ours.

240
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,613
What's their
maximum range?

241
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,740
If the homing transponder
was in place

242
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,491
up to three light years.

243
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,702
There<i> was</i> a homing transponder,
all right.

244
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,329
It was wrapped in this.

245
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,333
Three light years.

246
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,710
For all we know

247
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,546
she could be deep inside
Dominion space by now.

248
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,770
(<i> sighs</i> )

249
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,739
I had a feeling
you'd turn up

250
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,157
sooner or later.

251
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,410
I know you're angry with me.

252
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,162
Angry?

253
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,706
I feel sorry for you.

254
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:56,544
Letting yourself be duped by
Dukat into joining this cult.

255
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,130
I was a member of this "cult,"
as you call it

256
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,881
long before Dukat.

257
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,175
I came to it

258
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,135
toward the end
of the occupation.

259
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,014
It's helped me make sense of...

260
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,767
the suffering
we all had to endure.

261
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,393
In the camp...

262
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,439
you kept us together.

263
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,691
I-it was your faith
in the Prophets

264
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,275
that got us through.

265
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,319
How could you, of all people,
turn your back on them?

266
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,822
They turned their backs on us...

267
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,615
long ago.

268
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:29,703
The path the Prophets laid out
for us isn't always easy...

269
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,664
but that's no reason
to turn to hate and fear.

270
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,457
"Hate and fear."

271
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:38,127
You know how often I've heard
those words used to describe us?

272
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,254
Nothing could be further
from the truth.

273
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,216
The Pah-wraith cult
tried to kill the Emissary.

274
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,259
Dukat had nothing
to do with that.

275
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,011
The boy who attacked
Captain Sisko

276
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,639
was acting out
of his own misguided beliefs.

277
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,766
We're a peaceful people.

278
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,560
Then prove it.

279
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,019
Let me go.

280
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,356
Nerys, the Master
brought you here

281
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:01,317
because he cares about
your spiritual well-being.

282
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,569
"The Master"!

283
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,820
He's using you.

284
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,407
He's taking your beliefs

285
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,784
and twisting them
to suit his own purpose.

286
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,037
You're so stubborn.

287
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,955
That's always been your problem.

288
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,250
Your problem is
you're too trusting.

289
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,046
When Dukat first came to us

290
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:25,091
I didn't want to accept him

291
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:28,302
but I came to realize
the Pah-wraiths

292
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:32,891
had taken this man of evil
and washed him clean.

293
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,644
What could be
more wondrous than that?

294
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,104
How can you forget

295
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,356
all the friends we lost
during the occupation?

296
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,486
How can you forget
all the millions Dukat murdered?

297
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,531
You disappoint me, Nerys.

298
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,325
Of all the things
I tried to teach you

299
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:55,246
the most important
is the need to forgive.

300
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,294
Some things can't
be forgiven.

301
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:08,468
Let me show you how we live.

302
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:12,054
I want you to see the community
we're building here

303
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,599
so you'll know you have
nothing to fear from Dukat.

304
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:17,268
Or from us.

305
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,535
Only one of the fusion
generators is operational

306
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,664
so we don't have power
for things like replicators.

307
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,373
Where do you
get your food?

308
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,375
We've turned several
of the lower levels

309
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,210
into hydroponic bays.

310
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,130
What about things like,
uh, medical supplies?

311
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,799
You bring them
in from Bajor?

312
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,009
We have a few cargo shuttles.

313
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,637
We're well aware
that you may try and leave us

314
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:53,972
so you should know

315
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:56,474
that the docking bays
are being guarded

316
00:16:56,474 --> 00:17:00,394
as is the transporter
we used to bring you here.

317
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,104
While we're
on the subject, am I, uh...

318
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,898
free to move around,
talk to people?

319
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,399
Of course. It is
the Master's hope

320
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,568
that you will come to
see this as your home.

321
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,363
Mika... this is Nerys.

322
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,739
Welcome.

323
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,740
You're getting close.

324
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,200
Could be any time now.

325
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,995
Mika and her husband
have the honor

326
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:18,538
of being the first
to receive

327
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,623
the Master's blessing
to bear children.

328
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,166
You have to get per...

329
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,960
You have to get
<i>permission</i> from Dukat

330
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,545
to have a baby?

331
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:29,256
Vows of abstinence are part
of our covenant with him.

332
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,009
Exceptions are granted

333
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,219
only when he sees that
a husband and wife

334
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,096
have demonstrated
a true spiritual bond.

335
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,097
I see.

336
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,265
But you don't approve.

337
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,600
(<i> chuckles</i> )

338
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,310
In ancient times,
Bajorans understood

339
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,271
the value of denying
worldly pleasures.

340
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,941
Ironic, isn't it

341
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,985
that a Cardassian
would be the one

342
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,695
to lead us back
to the old ways?

343
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,321
Especially a Cardassian

344
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,742
whose appetite for worldly
pleasures is legendary.

345
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,160
That was a
long time ago...

346
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,997
before he felt the kiss
of the Pah-wraith.

347
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,123
That was some kiss.

348
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,633
Striking, isn't it?

349
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,764
Benyan is
Mika's husband.

350
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,724
Oh... congratulations.

351
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:22,351
I understand
it isn't easy to, uh...

352
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,437
get permission
to have a baby.

353
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,230
The Master told us

354
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,190
you wouldn't
approve of our ways.

355
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,068
He said we should
be patient with you.

356
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:32,194
Don't go out of your way.

357
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,239
I don't understand
why he brought you here.

358
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,950
Benyan...
That's all right.

359
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,826
We all worked very hard
for what we have.

360
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,328
We don't need you or anyone
else to approve of us.

361
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,872
Fair enough.

362
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:46,375
Don't misunderstand.

363
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,253
I hope you come to feel
the love of the Pah-wraiths

364
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,006
but if you don't,
that's your loss.

365
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,340
No offense.

366
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,634
None taken.

367
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:58,429
In fact, I've always
found that, uh...

368
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,098
when people try to convince
others of their beliefs

369
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,641
it's because...

370
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,018
they're really just trying
to convince themselves.

371
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,938
I know what
I believe.

372
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:09,356
And that's what
scares me.

373
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,191
No offense.

374
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:17,156

391
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,664
Stay where you are.

The rest of you

393
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,709
get down on the floor.

394
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,585
I said

395
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,587
down on the floor!

396
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,346
Step aside.

397
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,597
No.

398
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,276
Enough, Nerys

399
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,445
unless you're willing
to kill us all.

400
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,538
(<i> grunting</i> )

401
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,207
(<i> groaning</i> )

402
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:59,299
Now do you understand
how much they love me?

403
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:14,523
Careful.

404
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,482
No sudden moves.

405
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,235
(<i> gasps in pain</i> )

406
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:29,080
I removed it
so I could tend to your bruise.

407
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,754
I had a meal prepared for you.

408
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,011
Oh, come now,
Nerys...

409
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:47,807
you haven't eaten anything
since you arrived.

410
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:53,271
I know what
you're thinking...

411
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,150
but really...

412
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,360
what good would it do
to try to kill me?

413
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,695
Even if you succeeded

414
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,073
it wouldn't get
you off Empok Nor.

415
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,617
You'd only make
a martyr of me.

416
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:09,203
You're right.

417
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:12,790
I don't want anything
to happen to you...

418
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,416
not until your followers

419
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,836
have a chance to see
what a fraud you are.

420
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,922
I love these people, Nerys

421
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,967
and they love me.

422
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,302
I should think

423
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:25,886
that after
what just happened

424
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,638
in the temple,
you'd realize that.

425
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:30,390
It always comes back to that,
doesn't it, Dukat?

426
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,600
Your desperate need

427
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,769
to win the love of
the Bajoran people.

428
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,563
You just never understood
why we didn't appreciate you.

429
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,859
If it hadn't been for me

430
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,611
the occupation would
have been much worse.

431
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,530
And you want
a "thank you"?

432
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:51,787
You were working people to death
in the Ore Processing Center

433
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,623
but that didn't stop you
from strutting around Terok Nor

434
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,709
picking out Bajoran women
to take to your bed

435
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,461
and actually believing
that they wanted to be there.

436
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,380
You mother<i> did</i> want to be there.

437
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,633
You took her away
from her children.

438
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:08,221
She did what she had to do
so that we could survive.

439
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,722
She loved me.

440
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:13,517
Maybe... she convinced herself
that she did

441
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,853
which is a<i> very</i> different thing.

442
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:18,105
(<i> sighs</i> )

443
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,483
Perhaps you're right.

444
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,239
And if I did, indeed

445
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:30,576
cause your mother
<i>any</i> pain...

446
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:33,704
I<i> deeply</i> regret it

447
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:36,290
just as I regret
many things I did

448
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,833
in those years.

449
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,752
That's why I'm so glad

450
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:42,588
the Pah-wraiths
have given me an opportunity

451
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:45,632
to redeem myself
in the eyes of your people.

452
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:46,967
How?

453
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,219
By recreating some kind

454
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:49,845
of idealized version
of the occupation?

455
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,764
'Cause that's what
you've done here.

456
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,557
You have
your station back

457
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,017
Bajorans to serve

458
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,227
your every whim

459
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:57,895
and the best part is,
this time...

460
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:00,731
they really<i> do</i> love you.

461
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:03,859
As misguided as that is...

462
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,486
they love you.

463
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:10,032
I'm so<i> glad</i> you're here, Nerys.

464
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:17,915
You embody everything
I most admire

465
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:20,458
about the Bajoran people.

466
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,379
Your passion...

467
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,715
your spirit...

468
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:31,845
I can see now why the
Pah-wraiths want you

469
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,431
at my side.

470
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:35,182
And why is that?

471
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,893
Because if I can open
your heart to them

472
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:42,982
then surely I can
open the heart of<i> any</i> Bajoran.

473
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,775
Your anger is

474
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:46,568
a challenge.

475
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,737
I welcome it.

476
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:53,159
Because, in the end, it will
only help me better serve

477
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,785
the Pah-wraiths.

478
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,787
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Yes.

479
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,916
It's Mika.
She's gone into labor.

480
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,793
Come, Nerys.

481
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:06,797
I want you to be a witness
at this blessed event.

482
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,767
(<i> excited conversation</i> )

483
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:24,273
Ah...

484
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:27,318
this is a great day
for us, Benyan.

485
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:29,569
You should be honored
to have fathered

486
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,490
the first child born
to our community.

487
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,325
I only hope that Mika
and I can live up

488
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:35,575
to the faith
you've shown in us.

489
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,703
Oh, I have no doubt
that you will.

490
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:40,998
Your family will be
the first of many.

491
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:42,624
Think of it.

492
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:47,463
Someday, Empok Nor will ring
with the laughter of children.

493
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,799
You don't approve, Nerys.

494
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,885
Children being raised
to follow the Pah-wraiths?

495
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:53,927
You can bet
I don't approve.

496
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,514
This is a special moment.

497
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:59,392
I'm not going to ruin it
by arguing with you.

498
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,935
You believe the Prophets
are the true Gods of Bajor.

499
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,396
I believe the
Pah-wraiths are.

500
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:05,064
Let's just
leave it at that.

501
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,648
I'd be happy to.

502
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,566
There's just one thing--
we can't both be right.

503
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,487
(<i> people oohing</i> )

504
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:37,430
The Pah-wraiths...

505
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,391
they've sent us a sign.

506
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:46,021
My children, good news.

507
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,566
Something wondrous has happened.

508
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:51,360
This infant...

509
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,195
born of the love

510
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,531
between Benyan
and Mika

511
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,367
was transformed
in her womb

512
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,910
into a living symbol

513
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,954
of the covenant I made with you.

514
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,873
Oh, what a blessed day
this is.

515
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,460
There can no longer
be any doubt

516
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,378
that the Pah-wraiths

517
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,297
are smiling upon us.

518
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:13,673
Let us give thanks

519
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,633

Fala, I don't understand this.

You're an
intelligent man.

530
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,714
How can you believe
Dukat's story?

531
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:57,134
It's obvious he's
the child's father.

532
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:01,514
What's obvious is
you hate him so much

533
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:03,432
you can't even entertain
the possibility

534
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:05,934
that a miracle has occurred.

535
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:09,104
Are you so blind that
you will just believe

536
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,272
anything he says?

537
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,654
I have faith.

538
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:18,197
I would think
you'd understand

539
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,199
what that means.

540
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,618
Nerys, is it beyond
the realm of possibility

541
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:26,163
that the Pah-wraiths have
sent us this child as a sign?

542
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:29,166
They have powers
beyond our understanding.

543
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,377
Your Prophets made
an entire fleet

544
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:34,171
of Dominion ships
vanish into thin air.

545
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,549
What's one child compared
to a miracle like that?

546
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:39,885
You want to know
what the real miracle is?

547
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:41,554
That Mika didn't break into
tears in front of her husband.

548
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:43,347
She was terrified

549
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:45,432
he wasn't going to believe
Dukat's little performance.

550
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,850
I could see it in her eyes.

551
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,935
You saw what you wanted to see.

552
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:53,440
If you believe that
this really is a miracle

553
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,235
then you'll let me talk
to the happy couple.

554
00:28:58,028 --> 00:28:59,363
Oh, what's wrong?

555
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:01,781
Afraid of finding
out the truth?

556
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,579
I know the truth.

557
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:10,290
I just don't want you
making unfounded accusations.

558
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:14,461
I'll be discreet.

559
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,093
FALA:
Oh, it's coming
along nicely.

560
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,386
Maybe you should make

561
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,638
one of the children
half Cardassian...

562
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:26,599
to commemorate
what happened.

563
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,392
If I'd known,
I would have.

564
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,227
Must be quite an
honor to be part

565
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,187
of such a
miraculous event.

566
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,355
It is.

567
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,608
Obviously, Dukat
did the right thing

568
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:37,776
in giving his permission
for you to have a baby.

569
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,153
We prayed together
many times.

570
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,780
He wanted
to be sure.

571
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,865
Did you ever pray
with him alone?

572
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:44,950
Yes.

573
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,535
Did Mika?

574
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,332
Yes.

575
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:55,127
Nerys...

576
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,795
let's let Benyan
get back to work.

577
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,429
I want to find Mika.

578
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:06,639
When we do

579
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:08,140
I trust you'll
be more discreet

580
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,558
than you were
with Benyan.

581
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,449
(<i> sighs</i> )

582
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,159
I'm sorry.

583
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,745
Why didn't you tell me
the baby was mine?

584
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:31,037
I didn't know.

585
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,457
I was hoping it wasn't.

586
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:36,335
Oh, Mika, I'm so sorry
about what happened

587
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,628
that night.

588
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:39,672
I was weak...

589
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:42,882
and you were so beautiful.

590
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,468
I've forgiven you.

591
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:45,885
You know that.

592
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,680
Have you told anyone?

593
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,431
No.

594
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,099
Not even Benyan?

595
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,977
He wants to believe
it was a miracle

596
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:56,814
but I know
he has doubts.

597
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:59,733
If he ever asks me...

598
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:02,569
I don't know
if I can lie to him.

599
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,406
Thank you.

600
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,700
He said Mika went this way.

601
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,328
Don't worry.

602
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,955
Everything is going
to be all right.

603
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,915
Wait here
until I'm gone

604
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:17,292
then go back
to your quarters

605
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:20,253
and pray... for strength.

Mika?

609
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,265
Mika.

(<i> airlock controls beeping</i> )

611
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,398
Mika...

612
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:35,036
You got to her just in time.

613
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,500
How is she?

614
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,544
The depressurization
caused swelling

615
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,337
in her meningeal tissues.

616
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,381
I'm going to keep her
sedated until morning.

617
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,508
But she<i> will</i> recover.

618
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,135
She'll be fine.

619
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,430

check all the airlocks.

621

Let's make sure
we never have

622
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:59,561
another accident
like this again.

623
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:01,271
KIRA:
An accident?

624
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:02,731
What happened, Dukat?

625
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,399
Was Mika going
to tell everyone

626
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,943
that you're the
father of her child?

627
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:07,527
Kira...
Is that why you
tried to kill her?

628
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,528
Enough.

629
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,280
Fala, it's all right.

630
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,531
Nerys is obviously upset.

631
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,658
She doesn't know

632
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:13,992
what she's saying.

633
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,035
Mika isn't going to
lie for you anymore.

634
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:18,288
Take her to her quarters.

635
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,206
She needs to rest.

636
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,502
Keep him away from her.

637
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:31,343
DUKAT:
Let us all pray
for Mika's recovery.

640
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,900
Forgive my weakness.

641
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:51,571
Forgive me
for letting temptation

642
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,783
obscure the path
you laid out for me.

643
00:33:56,827 --> 00:34:01,206
When Mika awakes--
and I pray she does--

644
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,585
your children will learn
the truth.

645
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:10,298
They will turn away from me.

646
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:14,093
They will turn away from you.

647
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:18,264
The covenant will be broken.

648
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:22,352
Don't let that happen.

649
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:26,314
Tell me what to do.

650
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,901
Please.

651
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:35,991
Please.

00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:45,124
It's not time
for services.

654
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,501
I'll stay with her
if you want to go.

655
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,378
No. You go.

659
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:13,486
Tonight, as I prayed

660
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,949
the Pah-wraiths sent me
a vision.

661
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,492
They told me
it would be the last one

662
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,411
I'd ever receive from them.

663
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,705

664
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,540
There's a reason...

665
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,293
a wondrous reason.

666
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:32,923
My children, the Pah-wraiths
have asked us to join them

667
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:37,594
in their holy quest
to reclaim the Celestial Temple.

668
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:41,264
To become warriors
in this great battle

669
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,850
we must transform ourselves.

670
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:47,479
Our corporeal bodies are
not suitable for the task

671
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,689
so we must leave them behind.

672
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,275
In a few hours

673
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:56,989
at the beginning of a new day,
we will gather together here

674
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,324
for the last time.

675
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:04,329
We will shed the flesh
that ties us to this world

676
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,247
and deliver ourselves

677
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:10,836

of the Pah-wraiths.

to keep your followers
from turning against you.

I'm not surprised
you'd kill them

The Pah-wraiths
are calling me home.

You should be happy.

for use by their operatives
in case of capture.

Not only
is death swift

706
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:43,469
but it reduces the body to dust
within hours

of my passage through this
misbegotten universe, Nerys

00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:07,493
but it doesn't bother me

712
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:11,831
because I know I'm going to be
with the Pah-wraiths.

713
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:19,839
You really believe that.

716
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:34,771
(<i> door opens</i> )

717
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,734
(<i> all chanting softly</i> )

718
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,980
My children...

719
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:21,567
the time has come for us
to leave this world behind us.

720
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,653
(<i> cable snaps into place</i> )

721
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,824
(<i> high-pitched whine</i> )

722
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:32,370
(<i> whine intensifies</i> )

723
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,463
As we embark on this journey

724
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:46,384
our hearts are not heavy,
but joyful

725
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,554
because we know
we'll be together

726
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:53,058
in the holy light
of the Pah-wraiths.

727
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:56,435
This is a great day for us.

728
00:39:56,435 --> 00:40:00,023
We have proven ourselves worthy
of the Pah-wraiths

729
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:03,360
and they are calling us home.

730
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:09,074
This is the means
of our deliverance.

731
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:12,410
<i>Kosst no'valt Amojan,</i>
my children.

732
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,495
ALL:
<i>Kosst no'valt Amojan.</i>

733
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,581
DUKAT:
Be not afraid.

734
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,375
I love you all.

735
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,337
Dukat!

736
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:23,755
MALE:
Oh, no! Stop her!

737
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,340
(<i> grunting</i> )

738
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,806
Don't you see
why he's doing this?

739
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,226
He doesn't want you
to find out the truth.

740
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:39,396
(<i> all murmuring</i> )

741
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,653
Are you all right?

742
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,490
Everyone, please...

743
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,909
let us not allow
anything to disturb

744
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:54,744
this holy moment.

745
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,629
What's wrong, Dukat?

746
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:06,839
<i>Take</i> it.

747
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,717
They're all the same,
aren't they?

748
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,636
(<i> all murmuring</i> )

749
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,348
DUKAT:
My children

750
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:16,391
listen to me.

751
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:17,934
KIRA:
Tell them,
Dukat.

752
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,685
Tell them you never
had any intention

753
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:20,812
of dying with them.

754
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:24,023
(<i> angry clamoring</i> )

755
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,609
DUKAT:
My time here is not finished.

756
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:29,487
The Pah-wraiths want me
to continue bringing others

757
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,822
into their light.

758
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,870
This<i> is</i> his child.

759
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,289
That's why you tried

760
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:41,416
to kill Mika!

761
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:44,210
The Pah-wraiths
have forgiven my sins.

762
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,670
They've given me
their absolution.

763
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,339
(<i> yelling angrily</i> )

764
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:52,385
DUKAT:
Who are you to presume
they're wrong?

765
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:54,429
Who are you to judge me?!

766
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,806
(<i> angry clamoring</i> )

767
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:58,641
You've been making us fools
this whole time!

768
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,935
(<i> clamoring continues</i> )

769
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,354
Liar!

770
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:06,065
Then it's done.

771
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:09,735
Our covenant... is broken!

772
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:13,031
(<i> angry yelling</i> )

773
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:16,201
None of you will ever know
the love of the Pah-wraiths...

774
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,953
none of you!

775
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,413
(<i> angry yelling</i> )

776
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:21,622
False Gods!

777
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:24,292
(<i> angry yelling continues</i> )

778
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:30,465
(<i> yelling subsides</i> )

779
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:38,764
Fala, no!

780
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,814
Why?

781
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:52,653
Faith... Nerys...

782
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,366
faith.

783
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:09,628
I'm sorry
about Vedek Fala.

784
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:13,132
I keep going over what he
said when he died, and...

785
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,800
and I don't know if he
was trying to tell me

786
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,095
that he never lost his faith

787
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:18,555
or he felt betrayed by it.

788
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:20,765
I suppose you'll never know...

789
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:23,726
but one thing is certain.

790
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:26,312
These people have been betrayed
and now they have to find a way

791
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,523
to pick up the pieces
and move on.

792
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:31,650
I thought Dukat was just
claiming to share their faith

793
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,570
because he wanted
them to love him

794
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:35,696
but it was more than that.

795
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,698
He's changed.

796
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:41,244
If you hadn't stopped him,
he would've killed them all

797
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:44,122
and nobody would've known his
body wasn't among the remains.

798
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,249
That sounds like
the same old Dukat to me.

799
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:48,334
I know this is going
to sound crazy...

800
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:51,170
but I think Dukat
convinced himself

801
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,631
that he was doing what
the Pah-wraiths wanted.

802
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,300
(<i> sighs</i> )

803
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,759
Who knows?

804
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,386
Maybe he was.

805
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:00,513
Either way, he believes

806
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:03,475
and that makes him more
dangerous than ever.
