1
00:00:07,175 --> 00:00:11,015
The <i>Defiant</i> searched the
area for almost six hours.

2
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:13,685
We couldn't find
any sign of survivors.

3
00:00:13,726 --> 00:00:17,190
The <i>Cortéz</i> was a good ship.

4
00:00:17,236 --> 00:00:20,369
You knew Captain
Swofford a long time.

5
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:23,213
I introduced him to his wife.

6
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:24,345
Patrolling
the Cardassian borders

7
00:00:24,387 --> 00:00:26,187
is getting
more and more dangerous.

8
00:00:26,225 --> 00:00:27,855
You never know
when you're going to run

9
00:00:27,897 --> 00:00:29,527
into a squadron
of Jem'Hadar fighters.

10
00:00:29,567 --> 00:00:32,369
I guess we popped the
champagne cork too soon, huh?

11
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,845
Everyone thought
the war was over

12
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:36,715
when we retook the station

13
00:00:36,753 --> 00:00:39,921
and pushed the Dominion
back into Cardassian space.

14
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:42,263
I never believed that,
and neither did you.

15
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:46,209
A lot of good that did
the 400 people on the <i>Cortéz.</i>

16
00:00:49,486 --> 00:00:52,984
Ah. Mr. Sisko.

17
00:00:53,028 --> 00:00:55,158
How do you like
our station so far?

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,798
Well, it certainly is...

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,831
big.

20
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,956
I heard about Quentin Swofford.

21
00:01:09,972 --> 00:01:11,271
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:11,376 --> 00:01:15,284
Look, Dad... I know I haven't
been very good company

23
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:16,379
in the last few days.

24
00:01:16,422 --> 00:01:18,986
I didn't come here
to be entertained.

25
00:01:19,029 --> 00:01:22,128
I came to see you and Jake.

26
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,438
Well...

27
00:01:24,476 --> 00:01:27,210
you certainly picked
an interesting time

28
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,088
to take your first trip
away from Earth.

29
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:34,089
Well, I figured
it was now or never.

30
00:01:34,134 --> 00:01:37,108
Besides, I've been
worried about you.

31
00:01:37,142 --> 00:01:39,306
The last couple
of times we've talked

32
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,841
it seemed like you
were carrying the weight

33
00:01:40,885 --> 00:01:43,551
of the entire Alpha Quadrant
on your shoulders.

34
00:01:43,592 --> 00:01:45,894
Sometimes it certainly
feels that way.

35
00:01:47,903 --> 00:01:49,601
Dad...

36
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:51,704
Just say it, Son.

37
00:01:51,748 --> 00:01:55,588
I don't know
how much more I can take.

38
00:01:55,624 --> 00:01:58,757
I don't know how many more
friends I can lose.

39
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,363
Every time I achieve
a real victory

40
00:02:01,406 --> 00:02:02,773
something like this happens

41
00:02:02,809 --> 00:02:05,145
and everything
seems to turn to ashes.

42
00:02:05,182 --> 00:02:07,278
So what do you want to do?

43
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,724
Maybe it's time
for me to step down...

44
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,822
let someone else
make the tough calls.

45
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:14,600
I see.

46
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,976
No one is indispensable, Son.

47
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:18,677
Not even you.

48
00:02:18,718 --> 00:02:22,855
Whatever decision you
make, I'll support.

49
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:26,062
Of course, if Quentin
Swofford was here

50
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:29,840
I bet he'd have a few things
to say to you.

51
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,408
But he's not here,
and that's the whole point.

52
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,587
I'd say you have
some thinking to do

53
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,194
and I've got a dinner
date with my grandson.

54
00:02:39,237 --> 00:02:41,231
So you'd better get to it.

55
00:02:48,996 --> 00:02:50,431
Who was that?

56
00:02:55,179 --> 00:02:56,478
Where'd he go?

57
00:02:56,515 --> 00:02:57,916
Who?

58
00:02:57,952 --> 00:03:00,322
The man that just
walked by my door.

59
00:03:00,358 --> 00:03:01,918
I didn't see anyone.

60
00:03:01,963 --> 00:03:03,227
I could have sworn...

61
00:03:14,996 --> 00:03:17,058
I don't know what you're
so worried about, Ben.

62
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:18,401
I'm not taking my ship

63
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,103
anywhere near
the Cardassian border.

64
00:03:20,143 --> 00:03:23,481
I realize that, but the Dominion
is getting bolder and bolder

65
00:03:23,518 --> 00:03:26,492
and your freighter is no match
for a Jem'Hadar attack ship.

66
00:03:26,526 --> 00:03:27,995
Ah, they've got
to catch me first.

67
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,499
You're really not worried,
are you?

68
00:03:29,534 --> 00:03:32,838
No. I'm fearless,
and you know that.

69
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:34,471
That's why you love me.

70
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,451
I think I follow that logic.

71
00:03:36,486 --> 00:03:38,012
Hey, Benny!

72
00:03:42,902 --> 00:03:44,702
Catch the game?

73
00:03:46,044 --> 00:03:47,035
What?

74
00:03:51,558 --> 00:03:52,527
Who was that?

75
00:03:52,561 --> 00:03:54,429
Who was who?

76
00:03:58,276 --> 00:04:00,076
Ben?

77
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,778
Where are you going?

78
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,125
Somebody needs to help him!

79
00:04:19,163 --> 00:04:20,427
Call an ambulance! Oh!

80
00:04:27,117 --> 00:04:29,145
He's awake now.

81
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,931
Ben, are you all right?

82
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:33,934
I think so.

83
00:04:33,968 --> 00:04:34,937
Thank God.

84
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,873
Hey, Dad, you scared
us there for a minute.

85
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:37,878
What happened?

86
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:38,972
I don't know.

87
00:04:39,015 --> 00:04:41,921
I'm reading some unusual
synaptic potentials.

88
00:04:41,955 --> 00:04:43,619
Your neural patterns
are similar

89
00:04:43,693 --> 00:04:45,596
to those you experienced
last year.

90
00:04:45,631 --> 00:04:48,628
You mean... when I was having
those visions about Bajor?

91
00:04:48,673 --> 00:04:50,006
Visions?

92
00:04:50,043 --> 00:04:52,515
Does this have something
to do with those Prophets

93
00:04:52,549 --> 00:04:53,575
you're always telling me about?

94
00:04:53,619 --> 00:04:55,818
He's not going to need
surgery again, is he?

95
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:56,828
I'm not sure yet.

96
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:59,994
So I'd like you to remain
overnight for observation.

97
00:05:00,035 --> 00:05:01,869
Is that absolutely necessary?

98
00:05:01,907 --> 00:05:03,775
Take a look at these readings.

99
00:05:05,683 --> 00:05:08,121
Hey, you going
to buy that or not?

100
00:05:08,157 --> 00:05:12,122
...Shine little glow-worm,
glimmer, glimmer...

101
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:14,572
Now, personally, I don't
see the attraction.

102
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:16,806
Spaceships, flying
saucers, men from Mars.

103
00:05:16,846 --> 00:05:17,940
What's wrong with men from Mars?

104
00:05:17,982 --> 00:05:20,648
Nothing, except
it's all make-believe.

105
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:22,991
Me? I like war stories.

106
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:24,659
Did you see <i>From</i>
<i>Here to Eternity?</i>

107
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:28,037
Burt Lancaster standing there
in the middle of Pearl Harbor

108
00:05:28,075 --> 00:05:29,044
machine gun blazing...

109
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,143
shooting down those Zeroes.

110
00:05:32,186 --> 00:05:34,020
If it had been flying saucers...

111
00:05:34,058 --> 00:05:35,027
forget about it.

112
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,122
So you going to buy that or not?

113
00:05:39,571 --> 00:05:40,540
Benny!

114
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:41,543
Hello, Albert.

115
00:05:41,577 --> 00:05:43,046
I, uh...

116
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:46,021
I thought you might be
going to the, uh...

117
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:47,046
the office.

118
00:05:47,091 --> 00:05:49,255
We could walk there together.

119
00:05:49,297 --> 00:05:52,169
Exactly. Uh, uh...

120
00:05:52,205 --> 00:05:54,233
ah, there they are.

121
00:05:54,277 --> 00:05:57,912
So, you're looking
at the <i>Galaxy</i> I see.

122
00:05:57,953 --> 00:06:00,551
Paper here! Paper!

123
00:08:02,134 --> 00:08:04,196
<i>Voilà.</i> A pitcher of plain water

124
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,336
instantly becomes
a pitcher of iced tea.

125
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:07,712
Incredible!

126
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:09,549
"White Rose Redi-Tea."

127
00:08:09,587 --> 00:08:10,783
What an appalling concept.

128
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,987
Oh! H.G. Wells
would've liked it.

129
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:13,999
I doubt it.

130
00:08:14,032 --> 00:08:15,798
No self-respecting
Englishman would.

131
00:08:15,903 --> 00:08:16,802
Pabst!

132
00:08:16,906 --> 00:08:18,273
Pabst, get out here.

133
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:20,543
What's wrong now, Herb?

134
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:21,551
I'll give you one guess.

135
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,053
Oh, the "Battle of the
Doughnuts," Round 28.

136
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:24,422
That's it?
That's what you

137
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:26,623
called me out here for...
to complain about the doughnuts?

138
00:08:26,664 --> 00:08:28,065
They're stale again.

139
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:31,935
Delicious.

140
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:32,947
Delicious, my eye.

141
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,381
These are two days old,
and you know it.

142
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:36,184
I have been eating doughnuts
my whole life.

143
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:37,624
These weren't baked more than...

144
00:08:38,628 --> 00:08:39,688
...six hours ago.

145
00:08:39,732 --> 00:08:40,701
That's it.
I quit.

146
00:08:40,735 --> 00:08:41,704
I'm going over to <i>Galaxy.</i>

147
00:08:41,737 --> 00:08:42,706
Ha!

148
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,868
<i>Galaxy?</i> That rag?

149
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:44,969
- Who's winning?
- I bet that rag...

150
00:08:45,012 --> 00:08:45,981
Draw, same as always.

151
00:08:46,014 --> 00:08:47,540
You want to write
<i>Galaxy?</i> Go ahead.

152
00:08:47,586 --> 00:08:48,680
But they're not going to pay you

153
00:08:48,722 --> 00:08:49,884
four cents a word
for your stories.

154
00:08:49,992 --> 00:08:51,792
You're paying him four cents
a word?

155
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,992
Stay out of this, Julius.

156
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,160
Did you see
where I put the uh?

157
00:08:54,202 --> 00:08:55,900
The matches?
I gave them to you.

158
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,307
For that fantasy crap you write,

159
00:08:57,344 --> 00:08:58,745
you're lucky to be getting two.

160
00:08:58,782 --> 00:08:59,751
I beg your pardon?

161
00:08:59,784 --> 00:09:01,448
- What's that?
- The latest <i>Galaxy.</i>

162
00:09:01,488 --> 00:09:04,519
Benny has the new issue
of <i>Galaxy.</i>

163
00:09:04,563 --> 00:09:05,691
Let me see that.

164
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:14,115
Heinlein, Bradbury, Sturgeon.

165
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:15,282
Quite a lineup.

166
00:09:15,324 --> 00:09:17,386
Add Herbert Rossoff to them,
and it'd be complete.

167
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:20,197
What if I promise you
fresh doughnuts tomorrow?

168
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:21,297
Why should I believe you?

169
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,038
I'll even throw in
a couple of crullers.

170
00:09:23,077 --> 00:09:24,877
Okay, I'll stay.

171
00:09:24,915 --> 00:09:26,282
Don't do us any favors.

172
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,584
Good. Now that we've finished

173
00:09:27,623 --> 00:09:31,064
with the old business,
on to the new.

174
00:09:31,098 --> 00:09:33,332
Time to hand out next
month's story assignments.

175
00:09:33,371 --> 00:09:34,772
Rittenhouse, we're waiting!

176
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:37,144
Okay, friends and neighbors.

177
00:09:37,181 --> 00:09:39,449
Let's see what Uncle
Roy has for you today.

178
00:09:39,487 --> 00:09:41,219
All right, I've titled this one

179
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:43,561
"Please Take Me With You."
Who wants it?

180
00:09:43,597 --> 00:09:45,796
Hmm, what do you think, Jules?

181
00:09:45,837 --> 00:09:47,204
I think we can do
something with that.

182
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,938
Oh, I'll bet you can.

183
00:09:48,978 --> 00:09:50,345
I can see it now...

184
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,854
the lonely little girl
befriended by empathetic aliens

185
00:09:52,888 --> 00:09:54,586
who teach her how to smile.

186
00:09:54,626 --> 00:09:56,654
It's enough to make you go out
and buy a television set.

187
00:09:56,698 --> 00:09:57,860
Next.

188
00:09:57,901 --> 00:09:59,804
And this is
Mr. Pabst's favorite.

189
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,639
"Honeymoon on Andoras."

190
00:10:01,678 --> 00:10:03,444
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

191
00:10:03,482 --> 00:10:04,576
What? So I had
too much sauerkraut

192
00:10:04,619 --> 00:10:05,588
on my franks that night.

193
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:06,749
What can I say?

194
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,161
Be that as it may, that is
the worst piece of garbage

195
00:10:09,197 --> 00:10:10,666
- I have ever seen.
- Thank you.

196
00:10:10,702 --> 00:10:11,431
I'll take it.

197
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,496
Of course, you will.

198
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:14,841
You have an affinity
for garbage, don't you?

199
00:10:14,878 --> 00:10:16,347
The picture may be garbage

200
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:18,651
but the story...
the story will be art.

201
00:10:20,928 --> 00:10:22,056
All right

202
00:10:22,098 --> 00:10:23,567
I haven't got a title
for this one yet.

203
00:10:23,601 --> 00:10:25,538
Anybody got any ideas?

204
00:10:25,573 --> 00:10:26,701
I'll think of something.

205
00:10:30,285 --> 00:10:32,415
All right,
next order of business.

206
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:34,017
Some of our readers
have been writing in

207
00:10:34,062 --> 00:10:35,726
wanting to know
what you people look like.

208
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:38,331
Oh, write back and tell them
we look like writers...

209
00:10:38,373 --> 00:10:40,537
poor, needy
and incredibly attractive.

210
00:10:40,578 --> 00:10:42,515
Well, our publisher
has a better idea.

211
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,784
Mr. Stone has decided
to run a picture of you

212
00:10:44,823 --> 00:10:46,258
in next month's issue.

213
00:10:46,293 --> 00:10:47,489
Is that absolutely...

214
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,056
Necessary?

215
00:10:49,101 --> 00:10:50,229
I'm afraid it is.

216
00:10:50,271 --> 00:10:52,139
Kay, you can sleep
late that day.

217
00:10:52,242 --> 00:10:54,578
Of course, I can.

218
00:10:54,615 --> 00:10:56,050
God forbid
the public ever finds out

219
00:10:56,086 --> 00:10:58,422
that K.C. Hunter is a woman.

220
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:00,555
I suppose I'm sleeping late
that day, too.

221
00:11:00,597 --> 00:11:02,568
It's not personal, Benny,

222
00:11:02,602 --> 00:11:04,094
but as far as our readers
are concerned

223
00:11:04,173 --> 00:11:05,699
Benny Russell
is as white as they are.

224
00:11:05,743 --> 00:11:06,905
Let's just keep it that way.

225
00:11:06,947 --> 00:11:08,041
Oh, yes.

226
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,054
If the world's not ready
for a woman writer

227
00:11:10,088 --> 00:11:12,390
imagine what would happen
if it learned

228
00:11:12,428 --> 00:11:14,365
about a Negro with a typewriter.

229
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,336
Run for the hills.

230
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:18,103
It's the end of civilization.

231
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,515
What about W.E.B. Du Bois,
Zora Neale Hurston,

232
00:11:21,552 --> 00:11:25,050
Langston Hughes, Ralph Ellison,
Richard Wright?

233
00:11:25,094 --> 00:11:27,532
Did you ever hear of <i>Native Son?</i>

234
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:29,629
That's literature
for liberals and intellectuals.

235
00:11:29,673 --> 00:11:32,077
The average reader's not going
to spend his hard-earned cash

236
00:11:32,113 --> 00:11:34,016
on stories written by Negroes.

237
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:36,353
Would someone please shoot me
and put me out of my misery?

238
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,361
Oh, how I long for a gun.

239
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:40,333
I'm sorry, Benny.

240
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,700
I wish things were different,
but they're not.

241
00:11:41,737 --> 00:11:43,708
Wishing never changed
a damn thing.

242
00:11:43,742 --> 00:11:45,838
Come on, Benny,
it's just a photo.

243
00:11:45,882 --> 00:11:47,853
I'll try to remember that.

244
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:52,926
You're a dog.

245
00:11:56,876 --> 00:11:58,506
All right,
enough standing around.

246
00:11:58,548 --> 00:11:59,983
Get back to work.

247
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,031
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

248
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,739
What's the hurry?

249
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,546
That's my drawing.

250
00:12:25,584 --> 00:12:26,644
Is that so?

251
00:12:26,688 --> 00:12:27,816
Nice suit.

252
00:12:27,857 --> 00:12:29,292
Where'd you get it?

253
00:12:30,331 --> 00:12:31,391
I bought it.

254
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:34,065
Can I have my drawing back?

255
00:12:34,107 --> 00:12:38,174
Hey, boy, I'd watch that tone
of voice if I were you.

256
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:39,550
What are you doing around here?

257
00:12:39,587 --> 00:12:40,681
I work here.

258
00:12:40,724 --> 00:12:41,715
Yeah? Where?

259
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,729
In there.

260
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,200
What are you, the janitor?

261
00:12:45,235 --> 00:12:48,232
Awfully well-dressed
for a janitor.

262
00:12:48,276 --> 00:12:50,247
How do we know
that picture's yours?

263
00:12:51,686 --> 00:12:54,022
It's the drawing
of a space station.

264
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:55,392
Space station?

265
00:12:57,601 --> 00:12:59,469
Hey, hey...
hey, hey.

266
00:13:01,645 --> 00:13:03,616
Well, get off it already.

267
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,142
Okay, okay.

268
00:13:06,825 --> 00:13:07,919
See?

269
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:10,627
It's not worth anything
except to me.

270
00:13:10,668 --> 00:13:13,665
I say we run him in,
check him for priors.

271
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:17,674
Nah... we got to be uptown
in 15 minutes.

272
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:19,587
Take your drawing...

273
00:13:20,627 --> 00:13:22,153
and get out of here.

274
00:13:23,468 --> 00:13:26,636
Hey, hey. You're getting off
with a warning this time.

275
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:28,307
Next time, not so lucky.

276
00:13:28,347 --> 00:13:29,816
Now, get out of here.

277
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:32,120
You heard him... move on.

278
00:13:38,173 --> 00:13:40,475
I don't know, Kevin.

279
00:13:40,513 --> 00:13:44,250
This whole city's going
to hell in a handbasket, huh?

280
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:45,953
Damn shame.

281
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:48,625
Come on.

282
00:13:52,443 --> 00:13:54,073
And he said to me...

283
00:13:54,114 --> 00:13:58,079
"these words are
trustworthy and true.

284
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:02,090
"And the Lord, God of the
spirits of the Prophets,

285
00:14:02,135 --> 00:14:04,973
"has sent an angel
to show his servants

286
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:07,379
what must soon take place."

287
00:14:07,482 --> 00:14:09,112
Praise the Lord.

288
00:14:09,153 --> 00:14:10,486
Open their eyes.

289
00:14:10,524 --> 00:14:12,324
Help them to see.

290
00:14:12,362 --> 00:14:14,664
Are you talking to me?

291
00:14:14,701 --> 00:14:17,173
"Oh, that my words
were now written.

292
00:14:17,207 --> 00:14:19,839
Oh, that they were printed
in a book."

293
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:22,410
Write those words,
Brother Benny.

294
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:25,792
Let them see the glory
of what lies ahead.

295
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:26,856
"B-Benny"?

296
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,597
How do you know my name?

297
00:14:28,638 --> 00:14:31,874
Go now and write the truth
that's in your heart...

298
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:35,045
the truth
"that shall set them free."

299
00:14:35,087 --> 00:14:38,118
Praise be the word
of the Lord.

300
00:14:38,162 --> 00:14:40,396
Praise to the word
of the Prophets!

301
00:16:52,024 --> 00:16:54,588
Doo-wa, doo-wa,
doo-wa, doo-wa

302
00:16:54,631 --> 00:16:57,001
Hey, doo-wa, doo-wa

303
00:16:57,071 --> 00:16:58,335
Doo-wa, doo-wa

304
00:16:58,374 --> 00:17:00,277
Hey, doo-wa, doo-wa

305
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:01,804
Doo-wa, doo-wa

306
00:17:01,849 --> 00:17:03,113
Hey, bop

307
00:17:03,153 --> 00:17:05,181
Bop, bop, bop, ba.

308
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:07,955
Hey, baby.

309
00:17:08,032 --> 00:17:08,965
Have a seat.

310
00:17:09,035 --> 00:17:09,968
The usual?

311
00:17:10,037 --> 00:17:11,940
How about scrambling
those eggs today?

312
00:17:11,976 --> 00:17:12,945
Oh, my.

313
00:17:12,978 --> 00:17:14,242
Aren't we feeling adventurous.

314
00:17:14,282 --> 00:17:16,276
I have just written
the best story of my life.

315
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,414
Well, that's great, baby.

316
00:17:17,457 --> 00:17:20,329
Um... I've got
some good news, too.

317
00:17:22,036 --> 00:17:24,007
I talked
to Mrs. Jackson last night

318
00:17:24,107 --> 00:17:25,667
and she's serious
about retiring

319
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,112
in the next couple of years.

320
00:17:27,149 --> 00:17:29,587
I asked her about selling
this place to us

321
00:17:29,622 --> 00:17:31,616
and she said
that she would be willing.

322
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,392
Cassie, we have been over this.

323
00:17:33,432 --> 00:17:35,596
I have a job; I am a writer.

324
00:17:36,773 --> 00:17:38,368
And how much money have
you earned doing that?

325
00:17:38,411 --> 00:17:40,473
I've only been working
at it for a few years.

326
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,989
A few years?
More like 15,

327
00:17:43,023 --> 00:17:45,291
if you count all those stories
you wrote in the Navy.

328
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:46,423
That was amateur stuff.

329
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:47,867
Oh, baby.

330
00:17:47,903 --> 00:17:49,840
Neither one of us is
getting any younger.

331
00:17:49,874 --> 00:17:52,073
Can't you see?
This is our chance.

332
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,880
We can make some money.
We can get married.

333
00:17:54,921 --> 00:17:58,327
You're always talking about
writing for the future.

334
00:17:58,363 --> 00:18:00,733
Well, look around you.
This is our future.

335
00:18:03,443 --> 00:18:07,442
Cassie, hear the game
last night?

336
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,483
Went two for four,
robbed Snider of a tater.

337
00:18:10,528 --> 00:18:11,997
Should've heard the crowd...

338
00:18:12,031 --> 00:18:13,865
yelling and carrying on.

339
00:18:13,903 --> 00:18:15,065
Sure, they were yelling.

340
00:18:15,173 --> 00:18:17,873
They want to know why the Giants
are in fifth place.

341
00:18:17,914 --> 00:18:19,714
Would you please tell this fool

342
00:18:19,752 --> 00:18:21,814
to take his business
someplace else?

343
00:18:21,857 --> 00:18:23,258
Well, I thought about it.

344
00:18:23,294 --> 00:18:26,700
Trouble is, if he did leave,
he'd take my heart with him.

345
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,332
Well, suit yourself.

346
00:18:29,377 --> 00:18:30,403
But if you ask me

347
00:18:30,446 --> 00:18:32,610
it's a waste
of a very pretty heart.

348
00:18:32,652 --> 00:18:33,951
I don't think so.

349
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,757
Strike three.
You're out.

350
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:40,294
Oh, that's all right.

351
00:18:40,339 --> 00:18:42,538
I'll get another turn at bat.

352
00:18:42,577 --> 00:18:44,445
How about some steak and eggs?

353
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:46,146
Ah, coming right up.

354
00:18:46,187 --> 00:18:48,283
Uh, but tell me something.

355
00:18:48,325 --> 00:18:50,319
How come you
still living uptown?

356
00:18:50,365 --> 00:18:51,995
I mean, a famous
ballplayer like you

357
00:18:52,035 --> 00:18:53,801
you can live anywhere you want.

358
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,900
The hell I can.

359
00:18:54,943 --> 00:18:56,607
They can hardly
get used to the idea

360
00:18:56,648 --> 00:18:58,083
of me playing alongside them.

361
00:18:58,118 --> 00:18:59,678
Living next door to them?

362
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,124
That's a whole other story.

363
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:03,289
Besides, around here,
when people look at me

364
00:19:03,331 --> 00:19:05,701
it's 'cause they admire me.

365
00:19:05,738 --> 00:19:07,937
There, I'm just
another colored boy

366
00:19:07,977 --> 00:19:09,607
that can hit a curveball.

367
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:12,313
Now, if you will excuse me,
my public awaits.

368
00:19:13,925 --> 00:19:15,623
Ladies?

369
00:19:15,663 --> 00:19:17,189
Oh, hi, guys. Yeah.

370
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,800
I'll see about those eggs.

371
00:19:23,551 --> 00:19:25,419
Hey, hey, Benny.

372
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:26,823
You want to buy a watch?

373
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:27,885
How did you get that?

374
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:31,199
I found it.
Nice, huh?

375
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:32,570
Jimmy, you got
to turn this around

376
00:19:32,607 --> 00:19:34,202
or one day you're going
to find yourself

377
00:19:34,245 --> 00:19:35,214
in some serious trouble.

378
00:19:35,247 --> 00:19:38,221
Anything I can get into,
I can get out.

379
00:19:38,255 --> 00:19:39,519
You keep thinking that way

380
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:40,721
and watch what happens.

381
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,790
Man, why you always
trying to lecture me?

382
00:19:42,835 --> 00:19:43,929
I'm not trying
to lecture you, Jimmy.

383
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:44,939
I'm just trying to help.

384
00:19:44,973 --> 00:19:45,942
You want to help me?

385
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,070
You can buy this watch.

386
00:19:47,111 --> 00:19:48,080
I can use the cash.

387
00:19:48,114 --> 00:19:49,880
Why don't you get a job?

388
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,653
As what? A delivery boy
or a dishwasher?

389
00:19:54,264 --> 00:19:55,894
No, thanks.

390
00:19:55,934 --> 00:19:58,806
I like being my own boss,
setting my own hours.

391
00:19:58,842 --> 00:20:00,243
Sounds like a great life.

392
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:01,646
Yours ain't no better...

393
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:03,620
writing stories about
a bunch of white people

394
00:20:03,655 --> 00:20:04,624
living on the moon.

395
00:20:04,657 --> 00:20:05,921
Man, who cares about that?

396
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,794
Hey, I'm not doing that anymore.

397
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,062
I'm writing about us.

398
00:20:10,205 --> 00:20:11,640
What, colored people
on the moon?

399
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:13,772
Check out next month's issue.

400
00:20:13,814 --> 00:20:16,184
Colored people on the moon.

401
00:20:17,824 --> 00:20:18,952
I just might do that.

402
00:20:18,994 --> 00:20:21,934
But first, I'm going to need
to raise me some cash.

403
00:20:36,941 --> 00:20:38,809
Oh!

404
00:20:38,846 --> 00:20:41,216
She's got a worm in her belly.

405
00:20:41,252 --> 00:20:43,382
Oh, that's disgusting.

406
00:20:43,424 --> 00:20:45,919
That's interesting,
but that's disgusting.

407
00:20:45,964 --> 00:20:47,399
And you

408
00:20:47,469 --> 00:20:49,029
uh, um...

409
00:20:49,072 --> 00:20:51,168
if you don't mind my asking,
that is

410
00:20:51,212 --> 00:20:52,613
you... you are?

411
00:20:52,648 --> 00:20:55,952
I'm Mr. Pabst's new secretary,
Darlene Kursky.

412
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,120
Which one of yous wrote this?

413
00:20:58,163 --> 00:20:59,154
I did.

414
00:20:59,198 --> 00:21:00,167
You?

415
00:21:00,201 --> 00:21:01,295
Surprised?

416
00:21:01,338 --> 00:21:03,867
Well... it's just, it's
the best thing I've read

417
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:05,278
since <i>The Puppet Masters.</i>

418
00:21:05,314 --> 00:21:07,114
I read a lot of science fiction.

419
00:21:07,153 --> 00:21:08,179
Bless you, my child.

420
00:21:08,222 --> 00:21:10,284
The world needs
more people like you.

421
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:12,127
This story is really...

422
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,502
It's... um... uh...

423
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,339
How should I put it?

424
00:21:16,377 --> 00:21:18,371
It's... it's very...

425
00:21:18,415 --> 00:21:20,010
Impressive?

426
00:21:20,053 --> 00:21:21,420
Yes.

427
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,860
It's a damn fine piece
of writing is what it is.

428
00:21:23,896 --> 00:21:27,804
And "Deep Space Nine"
is a very intriguing title.

429
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,705
Very admirable.

430
00:21:28,742 --> 00:21:30,406
The master of understatement.

431
00:21:30,446 --> 00:21:31,745
What he really means is

432
00:21:31,784 --> 00:21:33,721
he wishes he had
half your talent.

433
00:21:33,755 --> 00:21:35,885
You know what, Benny?

434
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,365
I like this Major of yours.
She's a tough cookie.

435
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,929
Science fiction needs
more strong women characters.

436
00:21:40,974 --> 00:21:42,672
I'm always saying that,
aren't I, Jules?

437
00:21:42,712 --> 00:21:43,908
Ad nauseam, dear.

438
00:21:43,948 --> 00:21:45,247
These Cardassians...

439
00:21:45,285 --> 00:21:47,381
I like the way
you described them

440
00:21:47,424 --> 00:21:49,794
especially the neck ridges.

441
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,698
I'm going to do some sketches
for you to take a look at.

442
00:21:51,735 --> 00:21:52,704
Make a nice cover.

443
00:21:52,738 --> 00:21:53,764
Don't waste your time.

444
00:21:53,807 --> 00:21:55,471
You, get back to work.

445
00:21:55,511 --> 00:21:56,480
Right away, Mr. Pabst.

446
00:21:56,514 --> 00:21:57,483
You, too, Roy.

447
00:21:57,517 --> 00:21:58,850
Douglas, you're not
going to stand there

448
00:21:58,887 --> 00:22:00,151
and tell us you
don't like this story.

449
00:22:00,191 --> 00:22:01,387
Oh, I like it, all right.
It's good.

450
00:22:01,427 --> 00:22:02,589
It's very good.

451
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,225
But you know I can't print it.

452
00:22:04,267 --> 00:22:05,064
Why not?

453
00:22:05,103 --> 00:22:06,733
Oh, come on, Benny.

454
00:22:06,774 --> 00:22:09,076
Your hero's a Negro captain

455
00:22:09,113 --> 00:22:11,642
the head of a space station,
for Christ's sake.

456
00:22:11,687 --> 00:22:12,917
What's wrong with that?

457
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,426
People won't accept it.

458
00:22:14,461 --> 00:22:15,760
It's not believable.

459
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:18,168
And men from Mars are?

460
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:19,503
Stay out of this, Herb.

461
00:22:19,574 --> 00:22:21,134
Look, Benny

462
00:22:21,178 --> 00:22:22,978
I am a magazine editor.

463
00:22:23,016 --> 00:22:24,508
I am not a crusader.

464
00:22:24,621 --> 00:22:25,920
I'm not here
to change the world.

465
00:22:25,957 --> 00:22:27,860
I'm here to put out
a magazine, that's my job.

466
00:22:27,895 --> 00:22:29,729
That means I have to answer
to the publisher

467
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:31,795
the national distributors,
the wholesalers

468
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:33,434
and none of them
are going to want

469
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,847
to put this story
on the newsstand.

470
00:22:35,883 --> 00:22:38,047
For all we know, it could
cause a race riot.

471
00:22:38,088 --> 00:22:40,652
Congratulations, Douglas.

472
00:22:40,696 --> 00:22:43,260
That's
the most imbecilic attempt

473
00:22:43,303 --> 00:22:47,679
to rationalize personal
cowardice that I've ever heard.

474
00:22:47,714 --> 00:22:49,582
Oh. He's angry now.

475
00:22:49,652 --> 00:22:52,785
Huh! Herb's been angry
ever since Josef Stalin died.

476
00:22:52,827 --> 00:22:54,387
What's that supposed to mean?

477
00:22:54,432 --> 00:22:55,594
You know exactly
what it means.

478
00:22:55,634 --> 00:22:57,571
- You calling me a Red?!
- Easy, easy!

479
00:22:57,606 --> 00:22:59,406
Calm down, dear boy.

480
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:01,883
We're writers, not Vikings.

481
00:23:01,918 --> 00:23:05,485
I'm not going to stand here
and let some craven fascist

482
00:23:05,526 --> 00:23:07,394
call me a pinko
and get away with it.

483
00:23:07,431 --> 00:23:09,665
Douglas, um...

484
00:23:09,704 --> 00:23:13,008
what did you think
of, uh... of my story?

485
00:23:13,046 --> 00:23:14,015
I loved it.

486
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:15,450
You see, Albert's
got the right idea.

487
00:23:15,486 --> 00:23:17,582
He's not interested
in Negroes or whites.

488
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:19,528
He writes about robots.

489
00:23:19,563 --> 00:23:21,329
That's because he is a robot.

490
00:23:21,368 --> 00:23:22,598
No offense, Albert.

491
00:23:22,671 --> 00:23:24,608
Well, I...

492
00:23:24,643 --> 00:23:26,044
like robots.

493
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,450
They're very...

494
00:23:28,486 --> 00:23:31,460
uh-uh, efficient.

495
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:34,366
Here. Write me a novella
based on this picture.

496
00:23:34,401 --> 00:23:35,870
I'll print it
in next month's issue.

497
00:23:35,906 --> 00:23:37,900
You do a good job,
you might even get the cover.

498
00:23:37,944 --> 00:23:39,038
What about my story?

499
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,310
Look, the way I see it

500
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,512
you can either burn it
or stick it

501
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:42,648
in a drawer
for the next 50 years

502
00:23:42,723 --> 00:23:44,318
or however long
it takes the human race

503
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,329
to become color-blind.

504
00:23:45,363 --> 00:23:46,559
I want people to read it now.

505
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,571
Fine.
You want me to print it?

506
00:23:48,605 --> 00:23:49,631
Make the captain white.

507
00:23:49,675 --> 00:23:50,939
That's not what I wrote!

508
00:23:52,048 --> 00:23:53,108
It's your call.

509
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:12,788
I'm sorry they didn't
buy your story, baby.

510
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:14,234
Really, I am.

511
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:16,103
I told you
you were wasting your time.

512
00:24:16,141 --> 00:24:18,112
A colored captain.

513
00:24:18,146 --> 00:24:20,414
The only reason
they'll ever let us in space

514
00:24:20,452 --> 00:24:22,651
is if they need someone
to shine they shoes.

515
00:24:22,692 --> 00:24:24,526
Ain't that right, Cassie?

516
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,557
I don't know, and to be honest

517
00:24:26,602 --> 00:24:29,074
I don't much care what happens
a hundred years from now.

518
00:24:29,108 --> 00:24:30,738
It's today that matters.

519
00:24:30,778 --> 00:24:32,908
Well, I've got news for you.

520
00:24:32,951 --> 00:24:34,443
Today or 100 years from now...

521
00:24:34,488 --> 00:24:36,152
it don't make
a bit of difference.

522
00:24:36,193 --> 00:24:40,101
As far as they're concerned,
we'll always be niggers.

523
00:24:40,136 --> 00:24:41,902
Things are going to change.

524
00:24:41,941 --> 00:24:42,967
They have to.

525
00:24:43,011 --> 00:24:45,141
Oh, you keep
telling yourself that.

526
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:47,347
Maybe this is all happening
for a reason.

527
00:24:47,389 --> 00:24:49,519
You mean, maybe it's God's way
of telling me

528
00:24:49,561 --> 00:24:50,791
that I should quit writing

529
00:24:50,898 --> 00:24:52,664
and go
into the restaurant business?

530
00:24:52,703 --> 00:24:54,503
Hey, it's possible.

531
00:24:56,546 --> 00:24:59,212
Baby, I know
we can make this work for us.

532
00:24:59,253 --> 00:25:00,313
We could be happy.

533
00:25:00,356 --> 00:25:02,350
Besides, you don't
have to give up

534
00:25:02,394 --> 00:25:04,331
writing altogether.

535
00:25:04,366 --> 00:25:06,565
Maybe you could write something
for the <i>Amsterdam News</i>

536
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:09,010
or... some other
Negro newspaper.

537
00:25:09,045 --> 00:25:10,344
I'm not a reporter.

538
00:25:10,382 --> 00:25:11,373
I'm a writer.

539
00:25:11,417 --> 00:25:13,047
I write fiction

540
00:25:13,089 --> 00:25:14,558
and the <i>Amsterdam News</i>

541
00:25:14,592 --> 00:25:16,027
is not going to publish stories

542
00:25:16,063 --> 00:25:18,969
about a space station
400 years into the future.

543
00:25:21,443 --> 00:25:22,412
Hear the game last night?

544
00:25:26,724 --> 00:25:27,920
Oh, I'm sorry.

545
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:29,727
I didn't mean to frighten you.

546
00:25:29,766 --> 00:25:30,996
You don't look so good.

547
00:25:31,036 --> 00:25:32,005
You sick or something?

548
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:33,007
Oh, no, I'm fine.

549
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:34,340
You want to lie
down in the back?

550
00:25:34,377 --> 00:25:36,371
No, no, no, I...
I just need some air.

551
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:38,148
Are, are we still
on for tonight?

552
00:25:38,187 --> 00:25:40,591
I'll pick you up about 10:00.

553
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,670
Well, what are you doing
till 10:00?

554
00:25:45,707 --> 00:25:48,681
Whatever it is,
I won't be doing it with you.

555
00:25:57,671 --> 00:25:59,665
Hello, Brother Benny.

556
00:26:01,314 --> 00:26:02,408
You again.

557
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:05,356
I don't understand
what you want from me.

558
00:26:05,392 --> 00:26:08,423
To follow the path
of the Prophets.

559
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:11,736
Walk with the Prophets,
Brother Benny.

560
00:26:11,775 --> 00:26:13,210
Show us the way.

561
00:26:13,245 --> 00:26:14,875
What way?

562
00:26:14,916 --> 00:26:17,012
I don't know
what you're talking about.

563
00:26:17,054 --> 00:26:19,218
Write the words,
Brother Benny...

564
00:26:19,261 --> 00:26:21,995
the words that will lead
us out of the darkness

565
00:26:22,034 --> 00:26:25,270
onto the path
of righteousness!

566
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:27,405
Write the words, Brother Benny!

567
00:26:27,449 --> 00:26:29,283
Write the words!

568
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:13,127
Hey, baby.

569
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:14,693
Hey, hey, hey.

570
00:27:14,737 --> 00:27:16,674
You forgot all about our date.

571
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,978
Oh... our date.

572
00:27:19,015 --> 00:27:20,075
I'm sorry.

573
00:27:20,118 --> 00:27:21,178
I was working.

574
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,816
Ben Sisko?

575
00:27:23,861 --> 00:27:25,525
Isn't that your colored captain?

576
00:27:25,566 --> 00:27:26,660
Mm-hmm.

577
00:27:26,703 --> 00:27:28,731
Why are you writing
another one of those stories?

578
00:27:28,774 --> 00:27:30,745
You couldn't sell the last one.

579
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:33,149
What makes you think this one
will be any different?

580
00:27:33,186 --> 00:27:36,285
It probably won't be,
but it doesn't matter.

581
00:27:36,327 --> 00:27:38,491
It's what I've got to do.

582
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:40,628
Right now, what you've
got to do is eat.

583
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,540
I'm not hungry.

584
00:27:44,382 --> 00:27:46,353
What time is it anyway?

585
00:27:48,225 --> 00:27:49,957
It's after midnight.

586
00:27:49,996 --> 00:27:51,967
I should be getting
home to bed.

587
00:27:52,001 --> 00:27:54,303
But before I go, what do you say

588
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:56,471
we take a spin
on the dance floor?

589
00:27:56,513 --> 00:27:58,450
Okay.

590
00:28:08,745 --> 00:28:12,209
Mmm. Feels good, doesn't it?

591
00:28:12,253 --> 00:28:14,657
I could stay like this forever.

592
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,721
Mmm, me, too.

593
00:28:16,765 --> 00:28:17,734
It's times like these

594
00:28:17,768 --> 00:28:19,568
that I wish we'd never heard
of the Dominion.

595
00:28:19,606 --> 00:28:20,700
The Dominion?!

596
00:28:20,743 --> 00:28:22,076
What do you mean?

597
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:25,415
You said something
about the Dominion.

598
00:28:26,925 --> 00:28:28,623
What is it, Ben?

599
00:28:28,662 --> 00:28:30,496
What's wrong?

600
00:28:30,534 --> 00:28:31,798
I don't know.

601
00:28:31,838 --> 00:28:33,536
I think I'm losing my mind.

602
00:28:37,352 --> 00:28:39,118
What? Tell me,
tell me what's wrong.

603
00:28:39,223 --> 00:28:41,752
I'm starting to see
things from my story.

604
00:28:41,797 --> 00:28:45,398
It's as if I'm becoming
this Captain Sisko.

605
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:48,071
Okay, baby, you just need
to get some rest.

606
00:28:48,114 --> 00:28:50,142
It's all right.
It's all right.

607
00:28:50,219 --> 00:28:51,518
I'm with you.

608
00:28:51,556 --> 00:28:53,151
I'm with you, baby.

609
00:28:53,194 --> 00:28:54,595
Just take it easy.

610
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:56,186
Shh.

611
00:29:00,464 --> 00:29:02,594
Have you lost your mind?!

612
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,834
Lately, I've been asking myself
the same question.

613
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:06,344
I give you a novella to write.

614
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,180
I even offer you
a shot at the cover.

615
00:29:08,218 --> 00:29:10,189
Three weeks later,
instead of a novella

616
00:29:10,223 --> 00:29:11,818
you come back
with six stories...

617
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,094
six sequels to a story
I refused to publish

618
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:15,432
in the first place.

619
00:29:15,469 --> 00:29:16,802
So I guess the answer

620
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,867
to the question
we've both been asking

621
00:29:18,912 --> 00:29:20,644
is, yeah, you are certifiable.

622
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,881
I think you should print
your own stories, you know.

623
00:29:22,922 --> 00:29:24,654
Through a private
publishing house.

624
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,791
A nice, elegant volume...
50 to 100 copies.

625
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:29,499
That's a great idea.

626
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,774
Yeah, might as well write it
in chalk on the sidewalk.

627
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:33,247
More people
would read it that way.

628
00:29:33,283 --> 00:29:35,151
I've got an idea.

629
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:40,060
Why not make them,
you know, a, uh...

630
00:29:40,101 --> 00:29:41,765
a d-dream?

631
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:44,870
What's that?

632
00:29:44,912 --> 00:29:47,111
Just make the ending

633
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:51,289
of your first story
of "Deep Space Nine" a...

634
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,697
dream.

635
00:29:53,802 --> 00:29:55,705
Would that make a difference?

636
00:29:58,615 --> 00:29:59,743
That depends.

637
00:29:59,818 --> 00:30:01,048
On what?

638
00:30:01,088 --> 00:30:02,718
On who's doing the dreaming.

639
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:06,200
Well, obviously someone, uh...
someone without a lot of hope.

640
00:30:06,234 --> 00:30:08,228
A-a shoeshine boy, a convict...

641
00:30:08,274 --> 00:30:10,108
someone dreaming
of a better future.

642
00:30:12,985 --> 00:30:14,113
A Negro.

643
00:30:14,155 --> 00:30:15,488
Yeah.

644
00:30:15,525 --> 00:30:16,789
Well, I suppose it'd have to be

645
00:30:16,895 --> 00:30:18,627
if he was dreaming
about a Negro captain.

646
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:20,193
Hold on.

647
00:30:20,238 --> 00:30:23,178
Making it a dream
guts the story.

648
00:30:23,212 --> 00:30:24,647
Shut up, Herb!

649
00:30:24,683 --> 00:30:27,155
I think
it makes it more poignant.

650
00:30:27,189 --> 00:30:28,590
What about
the other Sisko stories?

651
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:29,822
He can't make them all dreams.

652
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:31,364
Let him get
this one published first

653
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,801
then he can worry
about the others.

654
00:30:32,837 --> 00:30:34,569
What do you think, Benny?

655
00:30:36,045 --> 00:30:37,640
I think...

656
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,326
it's better than chalk
on the sidewalk.

657
00:30:43,598 --> 00:30:44,567
Six, seven...

658
00:30:44,601 --> 00:30:45,627
Can I play?

659
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,504
Hey, Jimmy, I got great news.

660
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:49,239
We're headed for the stars.

661
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,875
Yeah, sure, whatever.

662
00:30:50,917 --> 00:30:52,113
Oh, come on.
I'll buy you lunch.

663
00:30:52,154 --> 00:30:53,180
I'll tell you all about it.

664
00:30:53,223 --> 00:30:55,194
Later. I got some business
to take care of.

665
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:56,198
Oh? What kind of business?

666
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:58,361
Big time.
That's all I got to say.

667
00:30:58,404 --> 00:30:59,703
Hey, hey, hey.
Hold it, hold it.

668
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,970
What are you talking about?

669
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:01,979
Don't worry about it.

670
00:31:02,012 --> 00:31:03,710
It's cool, man, I got
it under control.

671
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,719
Huh?

672
00:31:04,753 --> 00:31:06,120
I'll see you around.

673
00:31:09,031 --> 00:31:11,299
Bottom of the seventh,
I'm up again.

674
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:12,806
0-2 fastball... bam!...

675
00:31:12,841 --> 00:31:14,539
into the left field bleachers.

676
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:16,813
Had to be 400 feet.

677
00:31:16,851 --> 00:31:18,651
I know all about it, Willie.

678
00:31:18,689 --> 00:31:20,215
I read the newspaper.

679
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,786
Oh, but you got to admit...

680
00:31:21,831 --> 00:31:23,927
they don't tell it
like I tell it.

681
00:31:24,939 --> 00:31:26,465
Hey, Cassie!

682
00:31:30,754 --> 00:31:32,520
Hey, man, did you hear
the game last night?

683
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:33,891
I went two for four.

684
00:31:33,928 --> 00:31:35,420
Yeah, Willie, that's great.

685
00:31:35,466 --> 00:31:37,061
But I just hit a grand slam.

686
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:39,268
They are publishing one
of my Sisko stories, sugar,

687
00:31:39,309 --> 00:31:41,280
at three cents a word...
three cents a word!

688
00:31:41,314 --> 00:31:42,749
Oh, good for you, baby!

689
00:31:42,786 --> 00:31:44,085
That means tonight
we are celebrating.

690
00:31:44,122 --> 00:31:45,820
Dancing, the works.

691
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,886
I'll wear my red dress.

692
00:31:46,929 --> 00:31:48,524
You're damn...
right you will.

693
00:31:48,567 --> 00:31:49,968
Three cents a word.
Three cents a word.

694
00:31:50,037 --> 00:31:51,006
Whoo!

695
00:32:21,218 --> 00:32:22,653
Hey! There you are.

696
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,559
Oh! Oh, my poor feet.

697
00:32:25,596 --> 00:32:27,396
Baby, you better marry me soon.

698
00:32:27,434 --> 00:32:28,698
I'm not getting any younger.

699
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,538
Yes, but you are
getting more beautiful

700
00:32:30,576 --> 00:32:32,513
day by day.

701
00:32:32,548 --> 00:32:36,285
I'd be happy
just to spend my life

702
00:32:36,324 --> 00:32:41,065
Waiting on your beck and call...

703
00:32:42,105 --> 00:32:43,267
Brother Benny.

704
00:32:46,685 --> 00:32:48,211
I was hoping I'd see you again.

705
00:32:48,255 --> 00:32:51,023
I did it.
My story's getting published.

706
00:32:51,063 --> 00:32:53,501
"And the light of the Lord
is in his path."

707
00:32:53,536 --> 00:32:55,062
But, Brother Benny

708
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:58,170
this is only the beginning
of your journey

709
00:32:58,214 --> 00:32:59,547
not the ending.

710
00:32:59,584 --> 00:33:01,487
And the path of the Prophets

711
00:33:01,522 --> 00:33:04,792
sometimes leads
into darkness and pain.

712
00:33:04,832 --> 00:33:06,928
Benny, what is he talking about?

713
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,634
Who are you?

714
00:33:08,675 --> 00:33:11,615
I speak with the voice
of the Prophets.

715
00:33:21,976 --> 00:33:24,505
And in their words,
hope and despair

716
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:26,919
walk arm in arm.

717
00:33:31,702 --> 00:33:33,764
Did you understand
any of that?

718
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:38,284
Is that gunfire?

719
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:49,308
Hey! Hey! Whoa, whoa!

720
00:33:49,347 --> 00:33:50,407
What happened?

721
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,749
What's it to you?

722
00:33:51,787 --> 00:33:52,756
I know him.

723
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:54,258
Oh, yeah? Well, then
maybe you can explain

724
00:33:54,293 --> 00:33:56,059
what he was doing trying to
break into this car here.

725
00:33:56,098 --> 00:33:57,067
Is that why you shot him,

726
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,160
because he was breaking
into a car?!

727
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,169
He had a weapon.

728
00:33:59,273 --> 00:34:00,172
A crowbar!

729
00:34:00,275 --> 00:34:01,244
Yeah, now, step back.

730
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:02,247
- Let's go.
- Come on.

731
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,251
Hey!

732
00:34:04,286 --> 00:34:06,257
Stop it! Stop it!

733
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:07,624
Let him go!

734
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:10,123
Stop it, please!

735
00:34:10,234 --> 00:34:12,068
Get off of me!

736
00:34:12,106 --> 00:34:14,270
Stop it!
You're going to kill him!

737
00:34:15,582 --> 00:34:16,915
You're going to kill him!
Stop it!

738
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:20,219
Stop it!

739
00:34:22,332 --> 00:34:23,528
Stop!

740
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,114
I'm telling you, baby.

741
00:34:36,156 --> 00:34:38,651
You've been cooped up in
this apartment for weeks.

742
00:34:38,696 --> 00:34:40,895
Going down to the office
will do you good.

743
00:34:40,935 --> 00:34:42,370
I suppose you're right.

744
00:34:42,406 --> 00:34:44,742
I should be there
when the first copies

745
00:34:44,844 --> 00:34:47,043
of this month's issue
are delivered.

746
00:34:47,084 --> 00:34:48,053
Absolutely.

747
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:49,215
After all that work you did

748
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:51,888
you deserve to see
your story in print.

749
00:34:52,999 --> 00:34:55,905
Just no jumping up and
down with excitement.

750
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,073
Wouldn't want you
to hurt yourself.

751
00:35:02,825 --> 00:35:07,064
I will restrict myself
to a proud grin.

752
00:35:07,103 --> 00:35:10,077
You're not having any more of
those hallucinations, are you?

753
00:35:10,111 --> 00:35:11,775
I'm fine.

754
00:35:29,528 --> 00:35:31,431
What about
"It came from Outer Space?"

755
00:35:31,466 --> 00:35:32,958
I think it's a smashing title.

756
00:35:33,003 --> 00:35:34,063
I wish I'd thought of it.

757
00:35:44,132 --> 00:35:45,158
Hey, Benny.

758
00:35:47,073 --> 00:35:48,406
Long time no see.

759
00:35:51,217 --> 00:35:53,188
Is it here?

760
00:35:53,223 --> 00:35:54,192
Not yet.

761
00:35:54,225 --> 00:35:55,820
Pabst is still at the printer.

762
00:35:55,863 --> 00:35:56,832
We're waiting

763
00:35:56,865 --> 00:35:58,859
for his return
with bated breath.

764
00:35:58,937 --> 00:36:02,002
We, uh, heard that...

765
00:36:03,449 --> 00:36:05,352
that you were...

766
00:36:05,387 --> 00:36:07,187
Heard they beat the hell
out of you.

767
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:09,890
I'm okay.

768
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,636
Glad to see that you're...

769
00:36:13,675 --> 00:36:16,615
you know, up... and about.

770
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:19,783
Tell him the good news, Albert.

771
00:36:19,825 --> 00:36:20,656
Yeah.

772
00:36:20,694 --> 00:36:23,428
Oh, it's-it's nothing.

773
00:36:23,467 --> 00:36:24,436
Nothing?

774
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,666
He sells a novel to Gnome Press

775
00:36:25,707 --> 00:36:26,971
and he says it's nothing?

776
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:30,007
Novel, Albert.
Congratulations.

777
00:36:30,051 --> 00:36:31,020
Oh, thank you.

778
00:36:31,054 --> 00:36:32,023
Robots, huh?

779
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:33,823
What else?

780
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,578
It's about time.

781
00:36:44,723 --> 00:36:47,629
Douglas... magazine?

782
00:36:48,733 --> 00:36:50,465
There isn't any magazine...
not this month anyway.

783
00:36:50,504 --> 00:36:54,709
Mr. Stone had the entire run
pulped.

784
00:36:54,749 --> 00:36:55,682
He can't do that.

785
00:36:55,717 --> 00:36:57,813
Oh, he can... and he did.

786
00:36:57,857 --> 00:37:00,729
He believes, quote,
"This issue did not

787
00:37:00,765 --> 00:37:04,206
live up to our usual
high standards," unquote.

788
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,906
Well... what, what's that
supposed to mean?

789
00:37:06,947 --> 00:37:08,542
It means he didn't like it.

790
00:37:11,024 --> 00:37:14,796
Which means the public
will simply have to get along

791
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:18,070
without any "Incredible Tales"
this month.

792
00:37:18,109 --> 00:37:20,273
What exactly is it
that he did not like?

793
00:37:20,315 --> 00:37:23,083
The-the-the artwork,
the... the layout?

794
00:37:23,122 --> 00:37:27,498
Uh, what "high standards"
is he talking about?

795
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:28,593
Take it easy, Benny.

796
00:37:28,636 --> 00:37:29,662
No, I...

797
00:37:30,843 --> 00:37:33,407
It's about my story, isn't it?

798
00:37:33,449 --> 00:37:34,748
That's what this is all about.

799
00:37:35,788 --> 00:37:38,192
He didn't want
to publish my story

800
00:37:38,228 --> 00:37:39,994
and we all know why.

801
00:37:40,033 --> 00:37:42,528
Because my hero
is a colored man.

802
00:37:42,572 --> 00:37:44,236
Hey! This magazine
belongs to Mr. Stone.

803
00:37:44,277 --> 00:37:45,941
If he doesn't want
to publish this month

804
00:37:45,982 --> 00:37:47,816
we don't publish this month...
end of story.

805
00:37:47,853 --> 00:37:49,517
That doesn't make it right
and you know it.

806
00:37:49,557 --> 00:37:52,121
Don't tell me what I know.

807
00:37:52,165 --> 00:37:55,571
Besides, it's not
about what's right.

808
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,132
It's about what is.

809
00:37:58,881 --> 00:38:01,719
And I'm afraid I've got some
more bad news for you, Benny.

810
00:38:01,756 --> 00:38:03,990
Mr. Stone has decided
that your services

811
00:38:04,096 --> 00:38:05,760
are no longer required here.

812
00:38:05,799 --> 00:38:07,166
What?!

813
00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:08,537
You're firing me?

814
00:38:08,574 --> 00:38:10,340
I have no choice, Benny.

815
00:38:10,378 --> 00:38:12,076
It's his decision.

816
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,389
Well, you can't fire me.

817
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:17,760
I quit.

818
00:38:17,798 --> 00:38:19,928
To hell with you...

819
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:22,408
and to hell with Stone!

820
00:38:23,412 --> 00:38:24,904
Try to stay calm, Benny.

821
00:38:24,949 --> 00:38:26,418
No! I'm tired of being calm.

822
00:38:26,453 --> 00:38:28,925
Calm never got me a damn thing.

823
00:38:28,959 --> 00:38:29,928
I'm warning you, Benny.

824
00:38:29,962 --> 00:38:31,056
If you don't stop this

825
00:38:31,132 --> 00:38:32,658
I'm going to call the police.

826
00:38:32,702 --> 00:38:34,798
You go ahead!
Call them!

827
00:38:34,842 --> 00:38:36,368
Call anybody you want.

828
00:38:36,412 --> 00:38:38,508
They can't do anything to me.

829
00:38:38,552 --> 00:38:41,890
Not anymore...
and nor can any of you!

830
00:38:46,906 --> 00:38:51,213
I... am a human being, damn it.

831
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:55,785
You can deny me all you want...

832
00:38:55,829 --> 00:38:58,358
but you cannot deny Ben Sisko.

833
00:38:58,402 --> 00:38:59,632
He exists.

834
00:38:59,672 --> 00:39:03,637
That future, that space station,
all those people...

835
00:39:03,683 --> 00:39:05,586
they exist in here.

836
00:39:05,622 --> 00:39:09,587
In my mind, I created it.

837
00:39:09,632 --> 00:39:11,934
And every one of you know it.

838
00:39:11,971 --> 00:39:13,201
You read it.

839
00:39:13,241 --> 00:39:15,007
It's here!

840
00:39:15,046 --> 00:39:17,484
You, you, you hear
what I'm telling you?!

841
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:22,864
You can pulp a story,
but you cannot destroy an idea.

842
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,960
Don't you understand?

843
00:39:24,002 --> 00:39:25,232
That's ancient knowledge.

844
00:39:25,272 --> 00:39:28,303
You cannot destroy an idea.

845
00:39:29,885 --> 00:39:33,793
That future...
I created it, and it's real!

846
00:39:35,298 --> 00:39:37,360
Don't you understand?

847
00:39:37,404 --> 00:39:39,341
It is real!

848
00:39:39,376 --> 00:39:42,977
I created it, and it's real!

849
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:45,013
It's real.

850
00:39:45,057 --> 00:39:47,187
Oh, God!

851
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:02,432
Easy.

852
00:40:15,202 --> 00:40:16,797
Two, three...

853
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:40,662
Rest easy, Brother Benny.

854
00:40:40,702 --> 00:40:43,733
You have walked in the
path of the Prophets.

855
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:46,476
There is no greater glory.

856
00:40:46,517 --> 00:40:48,511
Tell me, please.

857
00:40:48,555 --> 00:40:50,617
Who am I?

858
00:40:50,661 --> 00:40:52,495
Don't you know?

859
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:53,695
Tell me.

860
00:40:54,738 --> 00:40:58,373
You are the dreamer...

861
00:40:58,481 --> 00:41:00,384
and the dream.

862
00:41:16,227 --> 00:41:17,287
Ben?

863
00:41:19,402 --> 00:41:20,598
Ben?

864
00:41:30,565 --> 00:41:32,034
How long was I out?

865
00:41:32,068 --> 00:41:34,062
Only for a few minutes.

866
00:41:34,107 --> 00:41:36,875
Seemed like forever to me.

867
00:41:36,914 --> 00:41:38,406
That's odd.

868
00:41:38,485 --> 00:41:41,425
Somehow your neural patterns
have returned to normal.

869
00:41:41,493 --> 00:41:42,792
That's good, isn't it?

870
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:43,957
Oh, it's very good.

871
00:41:43,999 --> 00:41:47,405
I just don't understand
how it happened.

872
00:41:54,259 --> 00:41:56,788
How are you feeling, Son?

873
00:41:56,832 --> 00:41:59,361
I'm okay.

874
00:41:59,406 --> 00:42:01,810
I'm done packing.

875
00:42:01,846 --> 00:42:04,877
Transport leaves
at 8:00 in the morning.

876
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,156
I wish you could stay longer.

877
00:42:08,196 --> 00:42:11,034
I've got to get back
to the restaurant.

878
00:42:11,069 --> 00:42:14,339
Ah, my customers have never
gone this long without me.

879
00:42:15,882 --> 00:42:19,380
The question is:
What are you going to do?

880
00:42:21,229 --> 00:42:23,428
The only thing I can do.

881
00:42:23,468 --> 00:42:27,433
Stay here
and finish the job I started

882
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:28,845
and if I fail...

883
00:42:28,883 --> 00:42:32,381
"I have fought the good fight.

884
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,919
"I have finished the course.

885
00:42:34,964 --> 00:42:38,268
I have kept the faith."

886
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:40,905
I've never known you
to quote from the Bible.

887
00:42:40,947 --> 00:42:44,353
I'm full of surprises,
aren't I?

888
00:42:45,893 --> 00:42:47,659
And so are you.

889
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:49,828
Sounds like that dream

890
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:53,140
you had... helped you
sort things out.

891
00:42:53,179 --> 00:42:56,312
I suppose it did.

892
00:42:56,354 --> 00:42:59,556
But I have begun to wonder.

893
00:42:59,629 --> 00:43:02,467
What if it wasn't a dream?

894
00:43:02,502 --> 00:43:07,447
What if this life we're leading,
all of this...

895
00:43:07,482 --> 00:43:10,456
you and me, everything...

896
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:15,401
what if all of this
is the illusion?

897
00:43:15,436 --> 00:43:18,342
That's a scary thought.

898
00:43:18,378 --> 00:43:20,474
I know. I know.

899
00:43:20,516 --> 00:43:23,456
But maybe, just maybe...

900
00:43:23,491 --> 00:43:25,189
Benny isn't the dream.

901
00:43:25,229 --> 00:43:27,063
We are.

902
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,402
Maybe we're nothing more
than figments

903
00:43:29,439 --> 00:43:33,506
of his imagination.

904
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:36,216
For all we know...

905
00:43:36,257 --> 00:43:39,095
at this very moment

906
00:43:39,131 --> 00:43:44,601
somewhere far beyond
all those distant stars...

907
00:43:44,646 --> 00:43:46,617
Benny Russell...

908
00:43:46,651 --> 00:43:49,419
is dreaming of us.
