1
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:09,718
The <i>Defiant </i>searched the area
for almost six hours.

2
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:12,804
We couldn't find any sign of survivors.

3
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:15,265
The <i>Cortez </i>was a good ship.

4
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,309
You knew Captain Swofford a long time.

5
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,438
I introduced him to his wife.

6
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:24,566
Patrolling Cardassian borders
Is getting more and more dangerous.

7
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:28,278
You never know when you'll run
into a squadron of Jem'hadar fighters.

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,114
I guess we popped
the champagne cork too soon, huh?

9
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,452
Everyone thought the war was over
When we retook the station

10
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,371
And pushed the Dominion
back into Cardassian space.

11
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,957
I never believed that,
and neither did you.

12
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,335
A lot of good that did the 400 people
on the <i>Cortez.</i>

13
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:53,803
Ah. Mr. Sisko.
How do you like our station so far?

14
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,347
Well, it certainly is...

15
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,474
Big.

16
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,441
I heard about Quentin Swofford.

17
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:09,861
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:13,740
Look, dad... I know
I haven't been very good company

19
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,116
In the last few days.

20
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:20,080
I didn't come here to be entertained.
I came to see you and Jake.

21
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,499
Well...

22
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:28,755
You certainly picked an interesting time
To take your first trip away from earth.

23
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,425
Well, I figured it was now or never.

24
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,553
Besides, I've been worried about you.

25
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,639
The last couple of times we've talked,

26
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,808
It seemed like you
were carrying the weight

27
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,519
of the entire alpha quadrant
on your shoulders.

28
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,479
Sometimes it certainly feels that way.

29
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:47,774
Dad...

30
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,068
Just say it, son.

31
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,780
I don't know how much more I can take.

32
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,408
I don't know
how many more friends I can lose.

33
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:01,579
Every time I achieve a real victory,
Something like this happens,

34
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,581
And everything seems to turn to ashes.

35
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,834
So what do you want to do?

36
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:10,213
Maybe it's time for me to step down,
Let someone else make the tough calls.

37
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,632
I see.

38
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,803
No one is indispensable, son,
Not even you.

39
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:24,686
Whatever decision you make, I'll support.
Of course, if Quentin Swofford was here,

40
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:28,189
I'd bet he'd have a few things
to say to you.

41
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,025
But he's not here,
and that's the whole point.

42
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,737
I'd say you have some thinking to do,

43
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,574
and I've got a dinner
date with my grandson.

44
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,617
So you'd better get to it.

45
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,127
Who was that?

46
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,091
Where'd he go?

47
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,217
Who?

48
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,219
The man that just walked by my door.

49
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,388
I didn't see anyone.

50
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,931
I could have sworn...

51
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,862
I don't know what
you're worried about, Ben

52
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,907
I'm not taking my ship
anywhere near the Cardassian border.

53
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,160
I realize that, but the Dominion
Is getting bolder and bolder

54
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,704
And your freighter is no match
For a Jem'hadar attack ship.

55
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,831
Ah, they've got to catch me first.

56
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,207
You're really not worried, are you?

57
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,002
No. I'm fearless, and you know that.

58
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,754
That's why you love me.

59
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,964
I think I follow that logic.

60
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,799
Man: Hey, Benny!

61
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,805
Catch the game?

62
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:45,391
What?

63
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:50,939
Who was that?

64
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,732
Who was who?

65
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,114
Ben? Where you going?

66
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,626
( Tires screeching )

67
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,475
BASHIR: He's awake now.

68
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,604
Ben, are you all right?

69
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,606
-I think so.
-Thank god.

70
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,525
You scared us there for a minute.

71
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,110
-What happened?
-BASHIR: I don't know.

72
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,862
I'm reading some unusual
synaptic potentials.

73
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,908
Your neural patterns are similar
To those you experienced last year.

74
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,578
You mean... When I was having
those visions about Bajor?

75
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,331
Visions? Does this have to do
with those prophets

76
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,791
You're always telling me about?

77
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,002
He's not going to need surgery
again, is he?

78
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,130
I'm not sure,
so I'd like you to remain overnight

79
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,298
For observation.

80
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,133
Is that absolutely necessary?

81
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,176
Take a look at these readings.

82
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,888
BOY: Hey, you going to buy that or not?

83
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,687
Now, personally,
I don't see the attraction.

84
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,106
Spaceships, flying saucers, men from mars.

85
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,566
What's wrong with men from mars?

86
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:20,778
Nothing, except it's all make-believe.
Me? I like war stories.

87
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,824
Did you see, <i>from here to eternity?</i>
Burt Lancaster standing there

88
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,617
In the middle of Pearl Harbor,

89
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:30,496
Machine gun blazing...
Shooting down those zeros.

90
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,166
If it had been flying saucers,
Forget about it.

91
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,460
So you going to buy that or not?

92
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,714
-Ah, Benny.
-Hello, Albert.

93
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:44,302
I, uh...
I thought you might be going to the, uh...

94
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,344
The office.

95
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,013
We could walk there together.

96
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,768
Exactly. Uh, uh...
If I could find... Ah, there they are.

97
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,938
So, you're looking at the galaxy I see.

98
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,649
Paper here! Paper!

99
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:06,360
{\an8}Voila. A pitcher of plain water
instantly becomes a pitcher of ice tea.

100
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,278
{\an8}Incredible!

101
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,364
{\an8}"White rose redi-tea."
What an appalling concept.

102
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,783
{\an8}Oh! H.G. Wells would've liked it.

103
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,911
{\an8}I doubt it.
No self-respecting Englishman would.

104
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,872
{\an8}Pabst! Pabst, get out here.

105
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,250
{\an8}-What's wrong now, Herb?
-One guess.

106
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,085
{\an8}"Battle of the doughnuts," round 28.

107
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,339
{\an8}That's it? You call me out here
to complain? About the doughnuts?

108
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,715
{\an8}They're stale again.

109
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,511
{\an8}Delicious.

110
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,971
{\an8}Delicious, my eye.
These are two days old, and you know it.

111
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,806
{\an8}I've been eating doughnuts my whole life.

112
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,935
{\an8}These weren't baked more than...
Six hours ago.

113
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,437
{\an8}That's it. I quit.
I'm going over to <i>galaxy.</i>

114
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,688
{\an8}<i>Galaxy?</i> That rag?

115
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,106
{\an8}HERB: That rag knows the difference
between doughnuts and doorstops.

116
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,650
{\an8}-Whose winning?
-Draw, same as always.

117
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:49,487
{\an8}Want to write in <i>galaxy?</i>
They won't pay four cents a word.

118
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,322
{\an8}You're paying him four cents a word?

119
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,032
{\an8}-Stay out, Julius.
-ALBERT: Where did I put?

120
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,867
{\an8}I gave you the matches.
I gave them to you.

121
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:58,287
{\an8}For that fantasy crap you write,
you're lucky to get two.

122
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,330
{\an8}-ALBERT: Maybe I put them over there.
-JULIUS: I beg your pardon?

123
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,207
{\an8}-What's that?
-The latest <i>galaxy.</i>

124
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,960
{\an8}KAY: Benny has the new issue of <i>Galaxy.</i>

125
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,044
{\an8}Let me see that.

126
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,302
{\an8}Heinlein, Bradbury, Sturgeon.

127
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,679
{\an8}Quite a lineup.

128
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,931
{\an8}Add Herbert Rossoff to them,
and it'd be complete.

129
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,809
{\an8}What if I promise you
fresh doughnuts tomorrow?

130
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,645
{\an8}-Why should I believe you?
-I'll even throw in a couple of crullers.

131
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,815
{\an8}-Okay, I'll stay.
-Don't do us any favors.

132
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:30,653
{\an8}Good. Now that we've finished
With the old business, on to the new.

133
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,155
{\an8}Time to hand out
next month's story assignments.

134
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,574
Ritterhouse, we're waiting!

135
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,742
Okay, friends and neighbors.

136
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,078
Let's see what uncle Roy
has for you today.

137
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:42,039
PABST: All right, I've titled this one
"Please take me with you."

138
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:45,376
-Who wants it?
-Kay: what do you think, Jules?

139
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,752
JULIUS: I think
we can do something with that.

140
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,547
Oh, I'll bet you can. I can see it now...

141
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,216
A lonely little girl befriended
by empathetic aliens

142
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,468
Who teach her how to smile.

143
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,637
It's enough to make you go out
and buy a television set.

144
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:57,680
Next.

145
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,725
ROY: This is Mr. Pabst's favorite,
"honeymoon on Andorras."

146
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,351
You've got to be kidding.

147
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,770
I had too much sauerkraut
in my franks that night.

148
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,105
What can I say?

149
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,108
That is the worst garbage
I have ever seen.

150
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,860
Thank you. I'll take it.

151
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,404
Of course, you will. You have an affinity
for garbage. Don't you?

152
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:18,034
The picture may be garbage,
but the story... The story will be art.

153
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,243
( Others scoffing )

154
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,997
PABST: All right, I haven't got a title
for this one yet.

155
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,125
-Anybody got any ideas?
-I'll think of something.

156
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,549
PABST: All right, next order of business.
some of our readers have been writing in

157
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,343
wanting to know what you people look like.

158
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:36,385
KAY: well, write back and tell them

159
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,680
We look like writers, poor, needy
and incredibly attractive.

160
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,766
Well, our publisher has a better idea.

161
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,893
Mr. Stone has decided to run
a picture of you

162
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,603
in next month's issue.

163
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,104
Is that absolutely...

164
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,231
Necessary? I'm afraid it is.

165
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,734
Kay, you can sleep late that day.

166
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,944
Of course, I can.

167
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,782
God forbid the public ever finds out
That K.C. Hunter is a woman.

168
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,950
I suppose I'm sleeping late that day, too.

169
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,079
It's not personal, but as far
as our readers are concerned,

170
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,457
Benny Russell is as white as they are.
Let's keep it that way.

171
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,375
( Sarcastically ) Oh, yes...

172
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,710
If the world's not ready
for a woman writer...

173
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,714
Imagine what would happen if it learned
about a Negro with a typewriter.

174
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:17,218
Run for the hills.
It's the end of civilization.

175
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,638
What about W.E.B. Dubois,
Zora Neale Huston,

176
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:24,767
Langston Hughes, Ralph Ellison,
Richard Wright?

177
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,185
Did you ever hear of<i> native son?</i>

178
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:29,063
That's literature for liberals
and intellectuals.

179
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,565
The average reader won't spend
his hard-earned cash

180
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,275
On stories written by Negroes.

181
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,069
Someone shoot me
and put me out of my misery.

182
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:39,448
-Oh, how I long for a gun.
-Sorry, Benny.

183
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,616
I wish things were different,
but they're not.

184
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,868
Wishing never changed a damn thing.

185
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,995
Come on, Benny, it's just a photo.

186
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,039
I'll try to remember that.

187
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,336
You're a dog.

188
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,884
All right, enough standing around.
Get back to work.

189
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,890
( Typewriter clattering )

190
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,073
Hey, hey, hey.

191
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,869
-What's the hurry?
-That's my drawing.

192
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,121
-Is that so?
-Nice suit.

193
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,497
Where'd you get it?

194
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,875
I bought it.

195
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,419
Can I have my drawing back?

196
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:37,298
Hey, boy, I'd watch that tone
of voice if I were you.

197
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:38,841
What are you doing here?

198
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,009
I work here.

199
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,051
RYAN: Yeah? Where?

200
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,052
In there.

201
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,388
What are you? The janitor?

202
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,349
Awfully well-dressed for a janitor.

203
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,393
How do we know that picture's yours?

204
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,897
It's the drawing of a space station.

205
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,690
BOTH: Space station?

206
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,777
MULKAHEY: Hey, hey... Uh-uh.

207
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,615
Well, get off it already.

208
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,158
Okay, okay.

209
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:09,747
See? It's not worth anything except to me.

210
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,500
Let's say we run him in,
check him for priors.

211
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,836
Eh... We got to be uptown in 15 minutes.

212
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:21,091
Take your drawing... And get out of here.

213
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,930
RYAN: Hey, hey. You're getting off
with a warning this time.

214
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,599
Next time, not so lucky.
Now, get out of here.

215
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,017
You heard him, move on.

216
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,817
I don't know, Kevin.

217
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,988
This whole city's going
to hell in a hand basket, huh?

218
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:44,657
Damn shame.

219
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,868
Come on.

220
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:56,418
MAN: And he said to me...
"These words are trustworthy and true.

221
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,965
"And the lord god started
the spirits of the prophets

222
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,552
"shall send his angel to show his servants

223
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,512
what must soon take place."

224
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:11,267
Praise the lord. Open their eyes.
Help them to see.

225
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,477
Are you talking to me?

226
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,938
"O, that my words were now written.

227
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,524
O, that they were printed in a book."

228
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:23,237
Write those words, brother Benny.
Let them see the glory

229
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,655
of what lies ahead.

230
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,408
"B-benny"? How do you know my name?

231
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,703
Go now and write the truth
that's in your heart...

232
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:37,084
The truth "that shall set them free."
Praise be the word of the lord.

233
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,253
Praise to the word of the prophets!

234
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,149
( Sighs )

235
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,130
( Typing )

236
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:57,057
( Singing doo-wop )

237
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,194
CASIE: Hey, baby. Have a seat. The usual?

238
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,363
How about scrambling those eggs today?

239
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:14,158
Oh, my. Aren't we feeling adventurous.

240
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,784
I have just written the best story
of my life.

241
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,869
That's great, baby.

242
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,955
I've got some good news, too.

243
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,960
I talked to Mrs. Jackson last night,
and she's serious about retiring

244
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,420
In the next couple of years.

245
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,006
I asked her about selling
this place to us,

246
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,258
and she said that she would be willing.

247
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:34,803
Cassie, we have been over this.
I have a job I am a writer.

248
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,015
And how much money
have you earned doing that?

249
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,225
I've only been working
at it for a few years.

250
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,937
A few years? More like 15...
If you count all those stories

251
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,022
you wrote in the navy.

252
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,024
-That was amateur stuff.
-Oh, baby.

253
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,027
Neither one of us is getting any younger.
Can't you see?

254
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,945
This is our chance.

255
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,156
We can make some money,
we can get married.

256
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,826
You're always talking about
writing for the future.

257
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,537
Well, look around you. This is our future.

258
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:04,583
In you go, ladies. Lunch is on me.

259
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,752
Cassie, hear the game last night?

260
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:09,880
Went two for four,
robbed Snider of a tater.

261
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:13,425
Should've heard the crowd...
yelling and carrying on.

262
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,135
Sure, they were yelling.

263
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,179
They want to know
why the giants are in fifth place.

264
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,141
Would you please tell this fool
to take his business someplace else?

265
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,643
Well, I thought about it.

266
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,979
Trouble is, if he did leave,
he'd take my heart with him.

267
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,441
Well, suit yourself. But if you ask me,

268
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,735
It's a waste of a very pretty heart.

269
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,112
I don't think so.

270
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,448
Strike three. You're out.

271
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:41,453
Oh, that's all right.
I'll get another turn at bat.

272
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,872
How about some steak and eggs?

273
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,292
Ah, coming right up.
Uh, but tell me something.

274
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:51,463
How come you still living uptown?
A famous ballplayer like you,

275
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,006
You can live anywhere you want.

276
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,384
The hell I can. They can hardly
get used to the idea

277
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,052
Of me playing alongside them.

278
00:18:57,427 --> 00:19:00,597
Living next door to them?
That's a whole other story.

279
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,891
Besides, around here,
when people look at me,

280
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,810
It's 'cause they admire me.

281
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:09,022
There, I'm just another colored boy
That can hit a curve ball.

282
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,525
Now, if you will excuse me,
my public awaits.

283
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,075
I'll see about those eggs.

284
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,873
Hey, hey, Benny. You want to buy a watch?

285
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:29,668
-Where'd you get that?
-I found it. Nice, huh?

286
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:33,088
Jimmy, you've got to turn this around
or one day you're going to find yourself

287
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,131
in some serious trouble.

288
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,134
Anything I can get into, I can get out.

289
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:40,179
You keep thinking that way
and watch what happens.

290
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,097
Man, why you always trying to lecture me?

291
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,184
-I'm not. I'm just trying to help.
-You want to help me?

292
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,394
You can buy this watch.
I can use the cash.

293
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,604
Why don't you get a job?

294
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,815
As what? A delivery boy or a dishwasher?

295
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,860
No, thanks.

296
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,821
I like being my own boss,
setting my own hours.

297
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,740
Sounds like a great life.

298
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:03,160
Yours ain't no better writing stories
about a bunch of white people

299
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,119
living on the moon.

300
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,329
Man, who cares about that?

301
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,915
Hey, I'm not doing that anymore.
I'm writing about us.

302
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,918
What, colored people on the moon?

303
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:15,255
-BENNY: check out next month's issue.
-Colored people on the moon.

304
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,757
( Chuckling )

305
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:21,470
I just might do that. But first,
I'm going to need to raise me some cash.

306
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,863
Oh! She's got a worm in her belly.

307
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:45,118
Oh, that's disgusting. That's interesting,
but that's disgusting.

308
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,828
And you,

309
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:50,499
Uh, um...
If you don't mind my asking that is,

310
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,042
You... You are...?

311
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,212
I'm Mr. Pabst's new secretary,
Darlene Kursky.

312
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,797
Which one of youse wrote this?

313
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,340
I did.

314
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,300
You? Surprised?

315
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:04,388
Well... It's the best thing I've read
Since <i>the puppet masters.</i>

316
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,973
I read a lot of science fiction.

317
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,268
Bless you, my child.
The world needs more people like you.

318
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:13,647
This story is really...
It's... It's... Um... Uh...

319
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,274
How should I put it?

320
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,401
It's... It's very...

321
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,237
-Impressive?
-Yes.

322
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,906
It's a damn fine piece
of writing is what it is.

323
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,535
And<i> deep space nine</i> is a very
intriguing title.

324
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:27,828
Very admirable.

325
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,621
The master of understatement.

326
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,749
What he really means is,
He wishes he had half your talent.

327
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,584
KAY: You know what, Benny?

328
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,462
I like this major. She's a tough cookie.

329
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:41,300
Science fiction needs more strong women.
I'm always saying that, aren't I?

330
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,926
Ad nauseam, dear.

331
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:46,513
These Cardassians...
I like the way you described them,

332
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,931
Especially the neck ridges.

333
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:51,643
I'm going to do some sketches,
make a nice cover.

334
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,061
Don't waste your time.

335
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,939
You, get back to work. You, too, Roy.

336
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,108
Douglas, you're not going to tell us

337
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,152
-You don't like this story.
-Oh, I like it.

338
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,113
It's very good.
But you know I can't print it.

339
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,615
-Why not?
-Oh, come on, Benny.

340
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,701
Your hero's a Negro Captain,

341
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:10,370
The head of a space station,
for Christ's sake.

342
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,872
What's wrong with that?

343
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,833
People won't accept it.
It's not believable.

344
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,378
-And men from mars are?
-PABST: Stay out of this, Herb.

345
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:22,924
Look, Benny, I am a magazine editor.
I am not a crusader.

346
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,136
I'm not here to change the world.
I'm here to put out a magazine.

347
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,555
That means I have to answer
to the publisher,

348
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,224
The national distributors,
the wholesalers,

349
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,603
and none of them are going to want
To put this story on the newsstand.

350
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,855
For all we know, it could cause
a race riot.

351
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,566
Congratulations, Douglas.

352
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:45,197
That's the most imbecilic attempt
To rationalize personal cowardice

353
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:46,948
That I've ever heard.

354
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,575
Uh. He's angry now.

355
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,620
Huh! Herb's been angry
ever since Josef Stalin died.

356
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,664
-What's that supposed to mean?
-You know exactly what it means.

357
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,625
-You calling me a red?
-Easy, easy.

358
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:00,796
Calm down, dear boy.
We're writers, not vikings.

359
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,591
I'm not going to stand here
and let some craven fascist call me

360
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,468
HERB: a pinko and get away with it.

361
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,095
Douglas, um...

362
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,099
What did you think of, uh... of my story?

363
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:16,269
I loved it. Albert's got the right idea.
He's not interested in Negroes or whites.

364
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,439
-He writes about robots.
-That's because he is a robot.

365
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,399
No offense, Albert.

366
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,026
Well, I...

367
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:29,616
Like robots.
They're very... Uh... Uh, efficient.

368
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,244
Here. Write me a novella
based on this picture.

369
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,746
I'll print it in next month's issue.

370
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,832
You do a good job,
you might even get the cover.

371
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,084
-What about my story?
-The way I see it,

372
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,877
You can either burn it
or stick it in a drawer

373
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,838
For the next 50 years
or how ever long it takes

374
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,841
The human race to become color-blind.
I want people to read it now.

375
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,844
You want me to print it,
make the Captain white.

376
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:49,886
That's not what I wrote!

377
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:51,888
It's your call.

378
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:11,449
I'm sorry they didn't buy
your story, baby.

379
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:12,701
Really I am.

380
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:16,788
I told you you were wasting your time.
A colored Captain.

381
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,583
The only reason
they'll ever let us in space

382
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,376
Is if they need someone
to shine their shoes.

383
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:23,211
Ain't that right, Cassie?

384
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,213
I don't know, and to be honest.

385
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,674
I don't much care what happens
a hundred years from now.

386
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,676
It's today that matters.

387
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,553
Well, I've got news for you.

388
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,556
Today or 100 years from now,
It don't make a bit of difference.

389
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:38,768
As far as they're concerned,
we'll always be niggers.

390
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,605
Things are going to change. They have to.

391
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,648
Oh, you keep telling yourself that.

392
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,775
Maybe this is all happening for a reason.

393
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,278
You mean maybe
it's God's way of telling me

394
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:51,364
I should quit writing
and go into the restaurant business?

395
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:52,866
Hey, it's possible.

396
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,206
Baby, I know we can make this work for us.
We could be happy.

397
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:02,167
Besides, you don't have to give up
Writing altogether.

398
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,003
Maybe you could write something
for the Amsterdam news

399
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,547
Or... Some other Negro newspaper.

400
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:11,927
I'm not a reporter.
I'm a writer. I write fiction,

401
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,804
And the Amsterdam news
is not going to publish stories

402
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,933
about a space station 400 years
into the future.

403
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,228
Hear the game last night?

404
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,563
( Yelling )

405
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:27,442
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.

406
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,946
You don't look so good.
You sick or something?

407
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:33,323
-Oh, no, I'm fine.
-You want to lie down in the back?

408
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,950
No, I... I just need some air.

409
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,743
Are we still on for tonight?

410
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,496
I'll pick you up about 10:00.

411
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,581
( Door shuts )

412
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,917
Well, what are you doing till 10:00?

413
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,836
Whatever it is,
I won't be doing it with you.

414
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,889
PREACHER: Hello, brother Benny.

415
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,309
Oh, you again.

416
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,728
I don't understand what you want from me.

417
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,564
To follow the path of the prophets.

418
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,651
Walk with the prophets, brother Benny.

419
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:11,861
Show us the way.

420
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,238
W--what way?

421
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:17,742
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Write the words, brother Benny...

422
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,704
PREACHER: The words that will lead
us out of the darkness

423
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:25,959
Onto the path of righteousness!
Write the words, brother Benny!

424
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,335
Write the words!

425
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,991
( Playing slow jazz )

426
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:10,837
Hey, baby.

427
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,756
Hey, hey, hey.

428
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,966
You forgot all about our date.

429
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,970
Ohh... Our date. I'm sorry. I was working.

430
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,308
Ben Sisko?
Isn't that your colored Captain?

431
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,768
Mm-hmm.

432
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,354
Why are you writing
another one of those stories?

433
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:30,398
You couldn't sell the last one.
what makes you think this one

434
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,608
will be any different?

435
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:34,402
It probably won't be,
but it doesn't matter.

436
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:39,115
It's what I've got to do.
Right now, what you've got to do is eat.

437
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,494
I'm not hungry. ( Yawning )

438
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,579
What time is it anyway?

439
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:50,210
It's after midnight.
I should be getting home to bed.

440
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,506
But before I go, what do you say
we take a spin on the dance floor?

441
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,216
Okay.

442
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,105
Mmm. Feels good, doesn't it?

443
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,650
I could stay like this forever.

444
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,777
Mmm, me, too. It's times like these

445
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,113
That I wish
we'd never heard of the Dominion.

446
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,447
The Dominion?

447
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,074
What do you mean?

448
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,868
You said something about the Dominion.

449
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,788
What is it, Ben?

450
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,124
What's wrong?

451
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,667
I don't know.

452
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,085
I think I'm losing my mind.

453
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:40,343
Tell me what's wrong.
I'm starting to see things from my story.

454
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,847
It's as if I'm becoming
this Captain Sisko.

455
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,224
Okay, baby,
you just need to get some rest.

456
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,352
It's all right. It's all right.

457
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,354
I'm with you. I'm with you, baby.

458
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:54,065
Just take it easy. Shh.

459
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,448
Have you lost your mind?

460
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,159
I've been asking myself the same question.

461
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,828
I give you a novella to write,
I even offer you a shot at the cover.

462
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,455
Three weeks later instead of a novella,

463
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,123
You come back with six stories,

464
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,792
Six <i>sequels </i>to a story
I refused to publish

465
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:17,255
In the first place. So I guess the answer
To the question we've both been asking

466
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:21,843
-Is, yeah, you are certifiable.
-I think you should print your own stories

467
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,598
Through a private publishing house.
A nice, elegant volume 50 to 100 copies.

468
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,224
That's a great idea.

469
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,185
Yeah, might as well write it in chalk
on the sidewalk.

470
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,103
More people would read it that way.

471
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:37,317
I've got an idea.
Why not make them, you know, a, uh...

472
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,403
A d--dream?

473
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,656
What's that?

474
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,742
Just make the ending

475
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:48,787
Of your first story
of <i>deep space nine </i>a...

476
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:50,997
Dream.

477
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,042
Would that make a difference?

478
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:55,502
( Sighs )

479
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,214
-That depends.
-On what?

480
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,799
On who's doing the dreaming.

481
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:04,969
Well, obviously someone, uh...
Someone without a lot of hope.

482
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,681
A--a shoeshine boy, a convict...
Someone dreaming of a better future.

483
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:10,892
( Sighs )

484
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:12,602
A Negro.

485
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:17,315
Yeah, well, I suppose he'd have to be
if he was dreaming about a Negro Captain.

486
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,234
HERB: Hold on.

487
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:23,112
-Making it a dream guts the story.
-Shut up, Herb!

488
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,781
I think it makes it more poignant.

489
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,909
What about the other Sisko stories?
You can't make them all a dream.

490
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:31,120
Let him get this published,
then worry about the others.

491
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:32,914
What do you think, Benny?

492
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,376
I think...

493
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,713
It's better than chalk on the sidewalk.

494
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:43,925
Can I play?

495
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:47,595
Hey, Jimmy, I got great news.
We are headed for the stars.

496
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,472
Yeah, sure, whatever.

497
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,765
-Oh, come on.
-I'll buy you lunch.

498
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,724
I'll tell you all about it.

499
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,685
Later. I got some business
to take care of.

500
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:54,811
What kind of business?

501
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,604
Big time. That's all I'm saying.

502
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,314
Hey, hold it. Hold it.

503
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,691
What are you talking about?

504
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:00,733
Don't worry about it.

505
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,527
-It's cool, I got it under control.
-Huh?

506
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:04,487
I'll see you around.

507
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,617
Bottom of the seventh, I'm up again.

508
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,996
O-2 fast ball... bam!
Into the left field bleachers.

509
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,623
Had to be 400 feet.

510
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,751
I know all about it, Willie.
I read the newspaper.

511
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,295
Oh, but you got to admit...

512
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,547
They don't tell it like I tell it.

513
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,008
BENNY: Hey, Cassie!

514
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,220
( Giggles )

515
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,180
WILLIE: Hey, man, did you hear
the game last night?

516
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,432
I went two for four.

517
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:35,018
That's great, but I just hit a grand slam.

518
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,978
They are publishing
one of my Sisko stories

519
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,439
At three cents a word, three cents a word!

520
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,232
Oh, good for you, baby!

521
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:44,027
That means tonight we are celebrating.
Dancing, the works.

522
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:47,363
-I'll wear my red dress.
-You're damn right you will.

523
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,990
Three cents a word. Three cents a word.

524
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:50,783
Whoo!

525
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:51,910
( Cassie laughing )

526
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,230
Hey! There you are.

527
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,231
( Humming )

528
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:25,818
Oh! Oh, my poor feet.
Baby, you better marry me soon.

529
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,236
I'm not getting any younger.

530
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,947
Yes, but you are getting more beautiful

531
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,823
Day by day.

532
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:35,078
<i>♪ I'd be happy just to spend my life ♪</i>

533
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:39,415
<i>♪ Waiting on your beck and call ♪</i>

534
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,377
PASTOR: Brother Benny.

535
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:49,217
I was hoping I'd see you again.
I did it. My story's getting published.

536
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,970
"And the light of the Lord
is in his path."

537
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,388
But, brother Benny,

538
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,849
This is only the beginning
of your journey,

539
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,059
not the ending,

540
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,686
and the path of the prophets

541
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:02,939
Sometimes leads into darkness and pain.

542
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,066
Benny, what is he talking about?

543
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,235
Who are you?

544
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,696
I speak with the voice of the prophets.

545
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:25,128
PASTOR: And in their words,
hope and despair walk arm in arm.

546
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,051
Did you understand any of that?

547
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,762
( Gunfire )

548
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,140
Is that gunfire?

549
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,234
-Hey! Whoa, whoa!
-What happened?

550
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:51,112
-What's it to you?
-I know him.

551
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,031
Oh, yeah? Maybe you can explain
what he was doing

552
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,407
trying to break into this car.

553
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,659
You shot him because he was breaking
into a car?

554
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,870
-He had a weapon.
-A crowbar!

555
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,204
Yeah, now, step back.

556
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,956
-Let's go.
-Come on.

557
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,957
Hey!

558
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:07,128
CASSIE: Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Let him go!

559
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,048
Stop it, please! Stop it! Get off me!

560
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,550
-Stop it!
-You're going to kill him!

561
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,928
( Cassie crying )
You're going to kill him!

562
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:20,725
( Crying ) Stop it! Stop it! Please...

563
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:24,604
( Sobbing ) Stop! Stop!

564
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:36,282
I'm telling you, baby. You've been cooped
up in this apartment for weeks.

565
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:38,409
Going down to the office will do you good.

566
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:42,580
I suppose you're right.
I should be there when the first copies

567
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,540
Of this month's issue are delivered.

568
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,043
Absolutely. After all that work you did,

569
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,212
You deserve to see your story in print.

570
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,549
Just no jumping
up and down with excitement.

571
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,843
I wouldn't want you to hurt yourself.

572
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:04,102
I will restrict myself to a proud grin.

573
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,522
You're not having any more
of those hallucinations, are you?

574
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:09,440
I'm fine.

575
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,330
( Door shuts )

576
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,335
KAY: What about
"it came from outer space"?

577
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:32,588
JULIUS: I think it's a smashing title.
wish I'd thought of it.

578
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:42,723
Hey, Benny.

579
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:45,810
Long time no see.

580
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:49,981
Is it here?

581
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:51,774
Not yet.

582
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,609
Pabst is still at the printer.

583
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,404
We're waiting for his return
with baited breath.

584
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,615
We, uh, heard that...

585
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:04,537
-That you were...
-We heard they beat the hell out of you.

586
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,206
I'm okay.

587
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,585
Glad to see that you're...

588
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,338
You know, up... And about.

589
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,175
Tell him the good news, Albert.

590
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:20,678
-Yeah.
-Oh, it's-it's nothing.

591
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,557
Nothing? He sells a novel to gnome press,
And he says it's nothing?

592
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:29,770
Novel, Albert.
Congratulations. Robots, huh?

593
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,522
Well, you know, what else?

594
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,441
( All laughing )

595
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,113
JULIUS: It's about time.

596
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,869
Douglas, magazine?

597
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,289
There isn't any magazine
not this month anyway.

598
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,959
Mr. Stone had the entire run pulped.

599
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:55,338
-He can't do that.
-Oh, he can... And he did.

600
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:58,341
He believes, quote, "this issue did not

601
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:01,427
"live up to our usual
high standards," unquote.

602
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,347
Well... What's that supposed to mean?

603
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,973
It means he didn't like it.

604
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:12,355
Which means the public will simply
have to get along

605
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:15,316
Without any "incredible tales" this month.

606
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:20,821
What exactly is it that he did not like?
The-the-the artwork, the, uh, the layout?

607
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:24,492
Uh, what "high standards"
is he talking about?

608
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,910
Take it easy, Benny.

609
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,203
No, I...

610
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,539
It's about my story, isn't it?

611
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,750
That's what this is all about.

612
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,253
He didn't want to publish my story,

613
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,757
And we all know why.
Because my hero is a colored man.

614
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:43,511
Hey! This magazine belongs to Mr. Stone.
If he doesn't want to publish this month,

615
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,429
We don't publish end of story.

616
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,098
And that doesn't make it right,
and you know it.

617
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,475
Don't tell me what I know.

618
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:54,313
Besides, it's not about what's right.
It's about what is...

619
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,985
And I'm afraid I've got some
more bad news for you, Benny.

620
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:03,114
Mr. Stone has decided that your services
are no longer required here.

621
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,240
What?

622
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:05,741
You're firing me?

623
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,201
I have no choice, Benny.

624
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,036
It's his decision.

625
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:13,332
Well, you can't fire me.

626
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:17,295
I quit. To hell with you...

627
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,756
And to hell with Stone.

628
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,174
Try to stay calm, Benny.

629
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:26,304
No! I'm tired of being calm.
Calm never got me a damn thing.

630
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:27,471
I'm warning you, Benny.

631
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,016
If you don't stop this,
I'm going to call the police.

632
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,809
You go ahead! Call them!

633
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:35,813
Call anybody you want.
They can't do anything to me.

634
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,607
Not anymore... And nor can any of you!

635
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:48,409
I... Am a human being, damn it.

636
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:55,499
You can deny me all you want...
But you cannot deny Ben Sisko.

637
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,500
He exists.

638
00:38:57,084 --> 00:39:02,548
That future, that space station,
all those people, they exist in here.

639
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:09,180
In my mind. I created it.
And every one of you know it.

640
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,681
You read it.

641
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:14,685
It's here. You get what I'm telling you?

642
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:19,690
You can pulp a story,
but you cannot destroy an idea.

643
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,318
Don't you understand?
That's ancient knowledge.

644
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:25,529
You cannot destroy an idea.

645
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:31,160
That future I created it, and it's real!

646
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:34,372
Don't you understand?

647
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:40,044
It is real! I created it, and it's real!

648
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:44,256
It's real. Oh, god!

649
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,967
( Weeping )

650
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,980
PARAMEDIC: Easy...

651
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,453
One... two... three.

652
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,810
Rest easy, brother Benny.

653
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,938
You have walked in the path
of the prophets.

654
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,607
There is no greater glory.

655
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,401
Tell me, please.

656
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,653
Who am I?

657
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,405
Don't you know?

658
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:50,656
Tell me.

659
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:55,077
You are the dreamer...

660
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,455
And the dream.

661
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,014
KASIDY: Ben.

662
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,600
Ben?

663
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,613
-How long was I out?
-Only for a few minutes.

664
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,574
Seemed like forever to me.

665
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,451
That's odd.

666
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,662
Somehow your neural patterns
have returned to normal.

667
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,373
-That's good, isn't it?
-Oh, it's very good.

668
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,293
I just don't understand how it happened.

669
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,552
How are you feeling, son?

670
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:54,929
I'm okay.

671
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:57,932
I'm done packing.

672
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,435
Transport leaves at 8:00 in the morning.

673
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,855
I wish you could stay longer.

674
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,149
I've got to get back to the restaurant.

675
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:10,986
My customers have never
gone this long without me.

676
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:15,908
The question is what are you going to do?

677
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:23,541
The only thing I can do.
Stay here and finish the job I started,

678
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,126
And if I fail...

679
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:31,674
"I have fought the good fight...
I have finished the course...

680
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,468
I have kept the faith."

681
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,638
I've never known you to quote
from the bible.

682
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,933
I'm full of surprises, aren't I?

683
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,186
And so are you.

684
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:49,692
Sounds like that dream
you had... Helped you sort things out.

685
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,735
I suppose it did...

686
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,322
But I have begun to wonder.

687
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:58,284
What if it wasn't a dream?

688
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:03,497
What if this life we're leading,
all of this...

689
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:11,589
You and me, everything...
What if all of this is the illusion?

690
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,174
That's a scary thought.

691
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:16,885
I know. I know.

692
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,430
But maybe, just maybe...

693
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:21,765
Benny isn't the dream.

694
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,267
We are.

695
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:28,606
Maybe we're nothing more than figments
of his imagination.

696
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:31,900
For all we know...

697
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:34,987
At this very moment,

698
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:40,284
Somewhere far beyond
all those distant stars...

699
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,953
Benny Russell...

700
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,664
Is dreaming of us.
