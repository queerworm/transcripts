00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,797
NARRATOR:<i> Last time on</i>
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...

2
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:07,883
If you could do any
science project you wanted to,

3
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:09,009
anything at all...

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,636
Visit the Gamma Quadrant?

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,483
We've never heard
of the Jem'Hadar.

6
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,318
Then you've been fortunate.

7
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,737
Negotiations with the Dominion

8
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,030
can be a
dangerous thing.

9
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:32,574
(<i> yells</i> )

10
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,785
The Dominion will
no longer stand by

11
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:38,455
and allow ships from your side
to violate our territory.

12
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,081
KEOGH:
Starfleet's orders are simple.

13
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,209
Traffic through the wormhole
will be suspended

14
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:43,585
until the<i> Odyssey</i>
can investigate

15
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,044
the Jem'Hadar's threat.

16
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,547
What about Benjamin
and the others?

17
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,298
Don't worry, Lieutenant.

18
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,801
Commander Sisko's return
is a top priority.

19
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,219
If you're going to try
to rescue them

20
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,345
then we're coming with you.

21
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,474
(<i> roaring</i> )

22
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,898
(<i> yelling</i> )

23
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:04,940
Here they come.

24
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,075
Major, one of
the Jem'Hadar ships

25
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,493
is making a direct
run at the<i> Odyssey.</i>

26
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:26,461
The Jem'Hadar wanted us
to escape, didn't they?

27
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,923
You have no idea
what's begun here.

28
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:32,384
She'll be back.

29
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,762
The question is
who she'll bring with her.

30
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:37,681
If the Dominion
comes through the wormhole

31
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,017
the first battle
will be fought here

32
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:43,520
and I intend
to be ready for them.

33
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,147
<i>And now, the continuation.</i>

34
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:56,909
(<i> sighs</i> )

35
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,453
We're in trouble,
people.

36
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,831
We've run seven simulations
and they all come out the same.

37
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,750
The Jem'Hadar
overwhelm our defenses

38
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,710
and board the station
within two hours.

39
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,503
Two hours doesn't even
give us time

40
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,171
to get reinforcements
from Bajor.

41
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,257
There must be something
we overlooked.

42
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,718
Major, I'm the last one
to say it's hopeless

43
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,429
but given DS9's
structural limitations

44
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,014
our available power supply

45
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:21,475
and the difficulty of defending
a stationary target

46
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,310
against a heavily
armed mobile force

47
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,186
I'd say two hours is optimistic.

48
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,605
Well, regardless of the time

49
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,273
the casualties
would be appalling.

50
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,110
All right, let's say we let
them board the station.

51
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,820
That still doesn't mean
we have to surrender.

52
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,362
What are you suggesting?

53
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,698
We can, uh...

54
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:40,035
we can hide in the conduits,
set up booby traps

55
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,370
prepare ambushes...
try and hold out

56
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,331
until we can get
reinforcements.

57
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,916
We can try,
but I don't think

58
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,626
there'd be
much of a station left

59
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:48,877
by the time they got here.

60
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,212
That leaves us
with two options--

61
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:54,549
abandon the station
and make a stand on Bajor.

62
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:59,054
Or... collapse the entrance
to the wormhole.

63
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,555
No, I want a<i> third alternative.</i>

64
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,099
I cannot believe
that we can't...

65
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:06,185
(<i> console beeping demandingly)</i>

66
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:09,397
Some kind of large subspace
surge has just activated

67
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,357
our security sensors.

68
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,399
Where is it?

69
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,359
Bearing 148

70
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,485
mark 215.

71
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,403
Distance 300 meters.

72
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,947
300 meters?

73
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,741
That's almost inside
our shield perimeter.

74
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,285
From the intensity
in the harmonic signature

75
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,038
it could be
a cloaked ship,

76
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:27,290
but I've never seen an energy
dispersal pattern like this.

77
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,084
It's too close for comfort,
whatever it is.

78
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,085
Red Alert.

79
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,128
Raise shields.

80
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,587
Energize phaser banks.

81
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,755
Stand by to lock
photon torpedoes.

82
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,674
The energy
signature's fluctuating.

83
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:36,800
It's de-cloaking.

84
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,100
It's definitely
a Federation starship,

85
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,144
but I've never seen
that design before.

86
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,521
A Federation ship
with a cloaking device?

87
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:50,898
It's hailing us.

88
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,149
On screen.

89
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,275
Hello, Major.

90
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,861
Sorry to startle you,
but I wanted

91
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,362
to test the<i> Defiant's</i>
cloaking device.

92
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,156
The<i> Defiant?</i>

93
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:02,367
I've brought back a little
surprise for the Dominion.

94
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:11,330
Officially, it's classified
as an escort vessel.

95
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,916
Unofficially,
the<i> Defiant's</i> a warship--

96
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,544
nothing more, nothing less.

97
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,047
I thought Starfleet
didn't believe in warships.

98
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:23,300
Desperate times breed
desperate measures, Major.

99
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,845
Five years ago, Starfleet
began exploring the possibility

100
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,763
of building a new
class of starship.

101
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:32,267
This ship would have
no families, no science labs

102
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,435
no luxuries
of any kind.

103
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,688
It was designed
for one purpose only--

104
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,815
to fight and defeat the Borg.

105
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,525
The<i> Defiant</i> was a prototype.

106
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,568
The first ship

107
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,652
in what would have been

108
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,945
a new Federation
battle fleet.

109
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,530
So what happened?

110
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,824
The Borg threat
became less urgent.

111
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,951
Also, some design flaws
cropped up

112
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,371
during the ship's
shakedown cruise

113
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,455
so Starfleet decided
to abandon the project.

114
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,583
What sort of design flaws?

115
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,294
You'll have complete access
to the ship evaluation reports,

116
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,504
but to put it simply,
it's overgunned

117
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,631
and overpowered
for a ship its size.

118
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,593
During battle drills,
it nearly tore itself apart

119
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,929
when the engines were tested
at full capacity.

120
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,681
And this is the ship
that Starfleet sends us

121
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,267
to fight off an attack
by the Dominion?

122
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:16,228
We're not going to fight
the Dominion, Major

123
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:18,105
at least, not yet anyway.

124
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:22,067
Our mission is to take the
<i>Defiant</i> into the Gamma Quadrant

125
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:25,904
and try to find the leaders
of the Dominion, the Founders.

126
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,488
We have to convince them
that the Federation

127
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,823
does not represent
a threat to them.

128
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,743
What if they
don't believe us?

129
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,162
That's why I asked
for the<i> Defiant.</i>

130
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,873
She may have flaws,
but she has teeth,

131
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,209
and I want the Dominion to know

132
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:43,004
that we can and will defend
ourselves, if necessary.

133
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,965
(<i> door opens</i> )

134
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,841
I've posted two
security officers

135
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,636
at the<i> Defiant's</i>
docking port, sir.

136
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,012
No one will get near
the cloaking device

137
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,139
without us knowing
about it.

138
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,807
ODO:
I wasn't informed

139
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,393
about any special
security arrangements.

140
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,146
The security arrangements
were by my request

141
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,815
to protect
the cloaking device.

142
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,442
A few introductions
are in order.

143
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:04,609
This is
Subcommander T'Rul

144
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,069
from the Romulan Empire.

145
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,155
She's here to operate
the cloaking device

146
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,406
which her government

147
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,408
so kindly loaned us
for this mission.

148
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:14,411
Romulan interests will be
served through cooperation,

149
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,955
and my role is to keep
unauthorized personnel

150
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,706
away from the cloaking device.

151
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,375
May I present my officers.

152
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,501
This is Major Ki...

153
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,004
Thank you,
but I know their names

154
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,298
and I'm not here
to make friends.

155
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:29,509
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

156
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,052
Charming.

157
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,721
Well, I<i> am</i> here
to make friends.

158
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:37,600
I'm Lieutenant Commander
Michael Eddington

159
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,311
Starfleet Security.

160
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,646
Major Kira Nerys.

161
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:49,363
Odo, Head of
Station Security.

162
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:52,532
May I ask what your function
is here, Commander?

163
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,617
SISKO:
There will be a complete
mission briefing

164
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,453
at 1800 hours,
but be prepared

165
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,913
to depart the station
at 0700 tomorrow morning.

166
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,207
Dismissed.

167
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,131
You needn't brace yourself

168
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,591
to give me
unpleasant news, Commander.

169
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,177
I'll save you
the trouble.

170
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:15,055
I've been relieved
as Chief of Security.

171
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,142
(<i> sighs</i> )

172
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,101
Odo, wait!

173
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,102
You've not been relieved.

174
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,854
You're still in charge

175
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,814
of all non-Starfleet security
matters aboard this station.

176
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,858
And what about matters
that<i> are</i> Starfleet?

177
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,568
In those areas, you
coordinate your efforts

178
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,777
with Commander Eddington.

179
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,321
"Coordinate" is
another way of saying

180
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,406
I'll report to him.

181
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,825
I'm sorry, Odo.

182
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,202
This wasn't my idea.

183
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,661
I'm sure it wasn't.

184
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,080
You were just
following orders.

185
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,249
An order I strongly
disagreed with.

186
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,709
I did everything
I could to fight this.

187
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,127
I even took it

188
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,213
to the Chief of Starfleet
Security herself,

189
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,923
but the decision
was final.

190
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,300
May I ask why?

191
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,927
There were some concerns

192
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,636
about several recent
security breaches.

193
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:56,846
(<i> exhales sharply</i> )

194
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,349
If I was given
the authority I asked for

195
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:02,060
instead of being tied
to Starfleet regulations

196
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,105
there wouldn't have been
any security breaches.

197
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,023
Odo, your resistance to
following Starfleet regulations

198
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,775
<i>is</i> part of the problem.

199
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:12,112
Well, I think there might be a
simpler explanation, Commander.

200
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,114
I think Starfleet
decided to bring in

201
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,740
someone they could trust--

202
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,827
someone besides
"the shape-shifter."

203
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,956
This is not
a racial issue, Odo.

204
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,207
I understand

205
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,292
how you must
feel, and I...

206
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,626
Commander.

207
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,712
I don't require
your understanding.

208
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,550
My resignation will be
logged within the hour.

209
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:46,854
Hey, hey, hey--

210
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,440
I thought you
were unpacking.

211
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,857
I am.
I mean, I was.

212
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,319
But I just kept looking
at the replicator and...

213
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,570
And you just had to have

214
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,779
some I'danian
spice pudding.

215
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,239
You know, I still can't believe

216
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,616
I couldn't get a decent bowl
back on Earth.

217
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:59,451
That didn't stop you
from ordering it

218
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:00,994
at every replicator you saw.

219
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,621
So...

220
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,164
is it good to be home?

221
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,540
Yeah.

222
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,501
I can't wait to sleep
in my own bed again.

223
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,170
Whew.

224
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,466
I wonder when that happened.
What?

225
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:19,137
When did I start thinking
of this Cardassian monstrosity

226
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,264
as home?

227
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,517
I think it happened...

228
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,018
last Thursday.

229
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,104
Around 1700 hours--

230
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,897
when you took
all of this stuff

231
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,525
out of storage
back on Earth.

232
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,860
I... Careful...

233
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,862
That's a 2,000-year-old
Yoruba mask,

234
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,572
and that "stuff" is one
of the finest collections

235
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,697
of ancient African art...

236
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,660
You'll ever see.
I know.

237
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,953
And I also know how much
it means to you.

238
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,872
But, to me,
this will always be

239
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,208
the stuff in your library...
at home.

240
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,293
When you took it
out of storage

241
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,212
so you could
bring it here

242
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,713
it meant that Earth
wasn't home anymore.

243
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,675
This was.

244
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:02,556
SISKO:
So...

245
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,392
what do you think?

246
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,977
Perfect.

247
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,407
Odo.

248
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,658
There you are.

249
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,410
I just finished talking

250
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,119
to the
provisional government,

251
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,288
and they want you to go with us
to the Gamma Quadrant tomorrow

252
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,998
to act as an official
Bajoran representative.

253
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,876
I'm no diplomat.
I know.

254
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,087
That's why they
want you to go.

255
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,338
If we do locate the Founders

256
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,215
we're going to need
more than diplomacy.

257
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,799
We're going to need
to size them up

258
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,926
see what kind
of threat they pose

259
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,302
to Bajor, analyze...

260
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,055
You're the military
expert, Major, not me.

261
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:47,392
And I doubt

262
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:50,103
that the provisional
government contacted you

263
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,646
and asked for my presence

264
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,440
on this mission.

265
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,066
If I'm not mistaken

266
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:58,695
this is a misguided attempt
to make me feel better.

267
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,197
Maybe it is.

268
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:05,368
Maybe I'm your friend.

269
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,036
And maybe I want you to see

270
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,456
that you are still
needed here...

271
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:14,294
no matter what some<i> idiot</i>
Starfleet admiral might think.

272
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:29,309
The<i> Defiant</i> leaves at 700 hours.

273
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:47,994
I'm a little confused,
Commander.

274
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:51,623
You want me to go with you
to the Gamma Quadrant

275
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:54,917
to help you locate
the Founders.

276
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:58,421
See? It's not
so confusing after all.

277
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,256
You're joking with me,
aren't you?

278
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,258
Having a little fun
with Quark.

279
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,343
I'm quite serious.

280
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,469
You can't be.

281
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:05,886
I'm not a diplomat

282
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,807
or an explorer
or a tactical officer

283
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:11,309
or whatever else you
might need on this trip.

284
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:14,604
Now, if you need a caterer,
I'd be happy to loan you

285
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,981
a new replicator
that I just got...

286
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,400
Eight months ago
you helped the Nagus

287
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,445
establish a trade agreement
with the Karemma, uh--

288
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:25,239
tulaberry wine, I believe.

289
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,701
The Karemma are
part of the Dominion.

290
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,744
A minor part--
a very minor part.

291
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,371
They might still
be able to help us

292
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,955
make contact
with the Founders.

293
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,249
Since you're experienced
in dealing with the Karemma,

294
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,544
it seems to me that you're
the logical person...

295
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,504
Actually, my brother Rom
did most of the talking.

296
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,715
I think he'd be better suited
for this mission.

297
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,466
Not Rom-- you.

298
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,676
But why?

299
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:47,178
Rom only has a son
to think about.

300
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,680
I have a business.

301
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,724
You.

302
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:57,731
I'm sorry, Commander,
but I must refuse.

303
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,400
My last experience
with the Jem'Hadar

304
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,109
was not a pleasant one

305
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:05,112
and I have no intention
of repeating it.

306
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:09,659
Now, there's no way you can
legally force me to do this.

307
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,620
(<i> thump</i> )

308
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:17,041
The scepter of the Grand Nagus.

309
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,044
I had a chance to discuss
this mission with him

310
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,671
on my way back from Earth.

311
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,089
He seemed to agree with me.

312
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,257
Unless peaceful contact

313
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,259
can be established
with the Founders

314
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,469
business opportunities
in the Gamma Quadrant

315
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,888
might suddenly dry up.

316
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,265
He also agreed with me
that you

317
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,392
are the perfect man
to help me.

318
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:36,561
I don't believe it.

319
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,062
Which is why he sent this along.

320
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,272
He thought it might convince you

321
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,315
of the high value
he holds

322
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,151
for the success of this mission.

323
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,780
Now...

324
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,615
are you going to defy

325
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:52,243
the wishes of the Grand Nagus
himself?

326
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:53,745
No, no... of course not.

327
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:56,997
I'm happy to serve the Nagus
any way I can.

328
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:57,998
Thanks, Quark.

329
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,459
I knew I could count on you.

330
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,877
Yeah.

331
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,631
Quark?

332
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,340
Aren't you forgetting something?

333
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,719
Oh.

334
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:23,316
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

335
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,916
I just thought
you'd like to know.

336
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,960
The<i> Defiant</i> will be
ready at 0700 hours.

337
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,294
Did it pass
the Chief's inspection?

338
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:44,754
Does anything?

339
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,464
His maintenance list
is as long as this table.

340
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,466
But he did say it will
take us where we're going.

341
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:51,552
And back, I hope.

342
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,638
Well, he said
that was up to you.

343
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,974
I'd never have volunteered
for this mission

344
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:58,852
if I didn't think we had
a chance of coming back.

345
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,228
How many times did
Curzon tell you

346
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,189
never volunteer for anything?

347
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:06,651
As I recall, Curzon broke
that rule a few times himself.

348
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,736
And regretted it every time.

349
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,488
This is different.

350
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,573
I'd be regretting it even more

351
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,117
if we just waited around
for an invasion.

352
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,584
If I know Starfleet,
they must have run

353
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,253
at least 200
probability studies

354
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,047
on this mission of ours.

355
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,925
So what are the odds
of us succeeding?

356
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,677
Slim.

357
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,223
But better odds
than fighting off

358
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,767
a Jem'Hadar assault
on this station.

359
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,645
And if the station falls,
then Bajor falls

360
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,605
and I will not let that happen.

361
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,486
You know, after Jennifer died

362
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,531
I never thought I would
see you this passionate

363
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,366
about something again.

364
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:58,786
Two months ago, I would
have agreed with you.

365
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,830
Then I went back to Earth

366
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,208
and I spent all
those weeks debriefing

367
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,377
at Starfleet Headquarters.

368
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:07,503
And I...

369
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:13,133
I used to get a thrill
just walking into that building.

370
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,177
I'd look around at the admirals

371
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,972
and think, "One day,
that's going to be me.

372
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,515
"One day,<i> I'm</i> the one

373
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,518
that's going to be making
the big decisions."

374
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,564
Curzon always thought
that was very funny.

375
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:27,565
Did he?

376
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,233
What I mean is

377
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,946
he could never see a set of
admiral stars on your collar.

378
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,949
He thought that just
making the decisions

379
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,575
would never satisfy you.

380
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,702
You had to implement them--

381
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:43,998
see the results,
face the consequences.

382
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:47,209
Curzon always thought
you were the kind of man

383
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,754
who had to be
in the thick of things--

384
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,840
not behind some desk
at Headquarters.

385
00:18:56,052 --> 00:19:00,431
He was a smart old man,
wasn't he?

386
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,976
He'd like to think so.

387
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:10,357
You'd better get
a good night's sleep.

388
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:13,319
I was just about to say
the same thing to you.

389
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,905
I'll see you
in the morning, Benjamin.

390
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,128
BASHIR:
The medical database
is practically nonexistent.

391
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:31,629
I've downloaded
as many of my files

392
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:32,922
from the station as I can

393
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,548
but this ship
simply wasn't designed

394
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,967
to handle many casualties.

395
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,802
Do the best you can,
and let's hope we don't

396
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,428
have to put your new
database to a test.

397
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,763
Yes, sir.

398
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,140
Quark's settling
into his quarters

399
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,349
and asked me
to relay to you

400
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,767
his profound
disappointment

401
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,771
in the accommodations,
and to inform you

402
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,148
that he could
get you in touch

403
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:52,274
with several reputable
interior decorators

404
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,943
for a modest fee.

405
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,029
I'll take his offer
under advisement.

406
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,613
Stand by to get underway.

407
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,699
Tactical and communications
are ready, sir.

408
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,035
Navigation and operations,
ready.

409
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,410
Weapons ready.

410
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,163
Impulse engines
on-line.

411
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,413
Warp power available
at your command.

412
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,166
Very well.

413
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,960
Seal the airlock,
release docking clamps, aft...

414
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,753
O'BRIEN:
Just a moment, sir.

415
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,673
There's someone in the airlock.

416
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:16,883
It's Odo.

417
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,260
Sisko to Odo.

418
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,388
Is there a problem, Constable?

419
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,766
No, Commander. I would like
permission to come aboard.

420
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:31,022
I'm here at the request
of the Bajoran government.

421
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,314
Permission granted.

422
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,441
Thank you, sir.

423
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,819
Dax, we'll have to arrange some
quarters for the Constable.

424
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,529
I'll do it, sir.

425
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,281
I need to go down to what is
laughingly called the Sick Bay.

426
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,324
Thank you, Doctor.

427
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,743
O'BRIEN:
Odo's aboard, sir.

428
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,119
The airlock's clear.

429
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,370
Release docking clamps.

430
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,288
Aft thrusters at one quarter.

431
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,624
Port and starboard
at station keeping.

432
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,268
We've cleared the station.

433
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,353
Lay in a course
to the wormhole.

434
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,939
I want to cloak as soon as
we reach the Gamma Quadrant.

435
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,232
Understood.

436
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,317
Course laid in, sir.

437
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,445
Engage.

438
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:46,097
The cloaking device
is operating

439
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:48,141
within normal
parameters.

440
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,726
Set course for
the Karemma system.

441
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,727
Warp 7.

442
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,853
DAX:
Aye, sir.

443
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,063
Engage.

444
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:58,276
QUARK:
Odo!

445
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,486
(<i> groans</i> )

446
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:01,988
(<i> sighs in exasperation</i> )

447
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:04,490
Is this the best
you can do?

448
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,242
I'm afraid so.

449
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,911
Most of the crew quarters
don't have life supports yet.

450
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,038
Besides, I think
we'd all feel a bit better

451
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,999
with someone here
to watch over Quark.

452
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,250
I take that

453
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,627
as a personal insult, Doctor.

454
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,378
You should.

455
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,423
Now, I think I'll
let you two bunkmates

456
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,176
get more comfortable.

457
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:26,428
Am I glad
to see you.

458
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,554
I have been stuck

459
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,640
down here in
this miserable hole

460
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,267
ever since
I came on board.

461
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,392
Bunk beds!

462
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,727
No view.

463
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,813
And I can't tell
you what came out

464
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,816
of that replicator when
I asked for synthehol.

465
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:42,653
So...

466
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:45,489
what's your role in
this little adventure?

467
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,326
Providing security,
no doubt.

468
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:50,368
Well, of course you are.

469
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,539
I mean, why else
would you be here?

470
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,833
I can tell you, I
feel much safer now

471
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,375
just knowing
you're along

472
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,711
because I know...

473
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:03,716
I have been holding
this shape for 16 hours.

474
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:06,969
I have to revert back
to my liquid state

475
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:10,430
but I don't want you to watch
and gawk at me!

476
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,227
I understand, completely.

477
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,688
This is a very
private moment

478
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,273
and I won't interfere.

479
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,863
This won't be so bad...

480
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:28,532
(<i> roars</i> )

481
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,827
I have no interest
in speaking to you

482
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:35,248
or in listening to
your witless prattle!

483
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:37,041
So stay out of my way

484
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:40,711
or you'll regret
the day you ever met me!

485
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,686
Commander,
long-range sensors

486
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:01,065
have picked up two Jem'Hadar
warships directly ahead.

487
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:03,650
They're heading
this way at warp 5.

488
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,778
How close will
they pass us?

489
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,405
100,000 kilometers.

490
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:10,324
That's well within range
of their weapons, Commander.

491
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:12,326
Should I alter course?

492
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:14,912
No, we need to know if they can
see through the cloaking device

493
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:16,496
and this is
as good a time as any.

494
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,539
Maintain course

495
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,665
and speed.

496
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,666
Red Alert.

497
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,627
Aye, sir.

498
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,754
Here they come.

499
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:26,090
They'll pass us
in five seconds.

500
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,216
On screen.

501
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,427
Track them.

502
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:31,011
O'BRIEN:
They're continuing

503
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,470
on their original heading.

504
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,223
No indication that they saw us.

505
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:35,224
(<i> console beeping</i> )

506
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,474
Wait a minute.

507
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,185
They're changing
course.

508
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,312
Heading this way.

509
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:40,854
They must have seen us.

510
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,815
They're powering
their weapon systems.

511
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:45,109
Prepare to de-cloak,
lock phasers on the lead ship...

512
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:46,693
No! We may not have
been detected.

513
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,195
Explain.

514
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,656
A cloaked ship radiates
a slight subspace variance

515
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:51,698
at warp speeds.

516
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,200
I never heard that.

517
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,619
It's not something we've
been eager to reveal.

518
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,579
I suggest dropping
out of warp.

519
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,748
That will eliminate
the variance.

520
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,667
When they reach
our position

521
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,294
they'll find nothing.

522
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,172
Do it.

523
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:07,423
All stop.

524
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,475
Commander,
they're sweeping the area

525
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:19,226
with some kind
of an anti-proton scan

526
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,895
and they're being
very thorough about it.

527
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,856
Will an anti-proton scan
penetrate the cloak?

528
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,732
O'BRIEN:
That's a good
question.

529
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,153
I'm not sure.

530
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:30,446
(<i> console beeps</i> )

531
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:31,447
They're getting closer.

532
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:33,240
O'BRIEN:
Commander.

533
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,867
The<i> Defiant's</i> power signature

534
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,244
is unusually high
for a ship this size.

535
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,872
The cloaking device
may not be masking everything.

536
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,751
Cut main power.

537
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:56,763
The other one
has broken off its search.

538
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:57,890
It's headed this way.

539
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,476
Stand by weapons and shields.

540
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,080
They've gone into warp...

541
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,915
and resumed
their original course.

542
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:25,876
The first thing to go right

543
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,920
in the Gamma Quadrant
in a long time.

544
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,630
Let's hope it's not the last.

545
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:44,311
SISKO:
<i>Ship's Log, Stardate 48212.4.</i>

546
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,355
<i>We have arrived</i>
<i>at the Karemma home world</i>

547
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:49,149
<i>and opened talks with one</i>
<i>of Quark's business partners</i>

548
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,818
<i>in an effort to contact</i>
<i>the Founders of the Dominion.</i>

549
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,779
The Grand Nagus himself

550
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:57,241
has sent me as an emissary
on his behalf.

551
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:58,825
If you aid us
in our mission

552
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,412
I'm authorized to
increase our purchase

553
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:05,249
of tulaberry wine
to the Karemma by three percent.

554
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:09,044
Hmm, looks like a
polyduranium alloy blend.

555
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:12,839
Interesting, but the
metal has no real value.

556
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,551
A three percent
increase is negligible.

557
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:17,677
I have
considerable leeway

558
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,637
to bargain in
this circumstance.

559
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:20,680
Name your terms.

560
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,933
Nothing, nothing,
nothing.

561
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:25,769
The terms are
not the issue.

562
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,062
I cannot help you
locate the Founders

563
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,646
because I do not
know who they are

564
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:31,024
or if they even exist.

565
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,151
Nothing.

566
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:35,154
Ah, here's something
interesting.

567
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:38,532
Appears to be
diamide-laced beritium.

568
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:40,200
I'll give you
52 diraks for it.

569
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,160
Done.

570
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,495
SISKO:
Quark.

571
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:44,580
I mean, one bargain
at a time, Ornithar.

572
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,373
We were talking
about the Founders.

573
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,167
There is nothing
further to say.

574
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,460
If the Founders exist

575
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,629
they clearly do not wish
to be contacted

576
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:53,547
and that is good enough for me.

577
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:56,175
Who's your contact
in the Dominion

578
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:59,512
regarding administration,
trade, defense?

579
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:01,054
Our only contact
with the Dominion

580
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,348
has been through the Vorta.

581
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:04,517
I have no idea
who they report to.

582
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:07,769
All I know is that the Vorta say
to do something and you do it.

583
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,480
Why?

584
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,359
Because if you do not, they
will send in the Jem'Hadar...

585
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,943
and then you die.

586
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,945
Will you put us in contact
with the Vorta?

587
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,365
Commander, we do only
as we are told, nothing more.

588
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:22,951
And so far, we have not been
told to help you in any way.

589
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,412
You haven't been told not to,
either.

590
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:28,332
No, but I prefer to err
on the side of caution.

591
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,543
In this case, being cautious
will cost you

592
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:31,627
a substantial profit.

593
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,170
The Ferengi will cease

594
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,755
purchasing tulaberry
wine immediately.

595
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:37,550
If you lost such
a valuable contract

596
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,758
with the
Alpha Quadrant

597
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,093
it might displease
the Vorta.

598
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,720
They may even send
the Jem'Hadar

599
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,055
to find out
what happened.

600
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,225
I will need to access

601
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,352
one of our computers
on the surface.

602
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,356
(<i> beeping</i> )

603
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,194
This is the Callinon system.

604
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:59,029
The Dominion maintains

605
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:01,657
an unmanned subspace relay
on the seventh planet.

606
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:03,116
We have been told by the Vorta

607
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,285
to direct
all communications there.

608
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:09,540
Where the messages are sent
after that is not our concern.

609
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,585
What is that?

610
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:15,713
It is the Omarion Nebula.

611
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:20,842
The Omarion Nebula...

612
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:27,433
If there is nothing else,
I would like to leave now.

613
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:28,559
Of course.

614
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,103
Uh, Commander,
I believe

615
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,812
I fulfilled my role
in this mission

616
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:33,813
so if you don't mind...

617
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,733
You want to
stay behind?

618
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:37,568
That was our agreement.

619
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:38,818
How can you be sure

620
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:40,487
he won't turn you
over to the Dominion

621
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,447
as soon as we leave?

622
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:43,156
He may serve
the Dominion,

623
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:46,034
but I'm the one lining
his pockets with latinum.

624
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,703
I'll book passage

625
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:51,373
on the next ship going
through the wormhole

626
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:54,627
and, uh, I'll make a profit
in the process.

627
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:56,044
All right, Quark.

628
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,046
Good luck.

629
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,923
Same to you, Commander.

630
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,762
Lay in a course
for the Callinon system.

631
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:05,929
DAX:
Aye, sir.

632
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,607
(<i> door chimes</i> )

633
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:18,108
Come in.

634
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,529
Did I wake you?

635
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,491
Not quite.

636
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:27,451
What can I do for you, Major?

637
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,202
It's about Odo.

638
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,621
(<i> sighs</i> )

639
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:31,747
You're worried about him.

640
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,749
Is it that obvious?

641
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:36,293
No, I'm worried about him, too.

642
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:40,339
But, at the moment, I don't know
what to do about it.

643
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,549
Can I speak freely?

644
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,470
What the hell is wrong
with Starfleet?!

645
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,096
How could they
do this to him?

646
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,931
This has been a long time
coming, Major.

647
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,351
Starfleet has never been
happy with the Constable.

648
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:53,977
They've been pressing me
to replace him

649
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,270
for the last two years.

650
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,439
Because he worked
for the Cardassians.

651
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,816
No, it goes deeper
than that.

652
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,859
Odo is not what you'd call
a team player.

653
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,402
Why? Because sometimes he

654
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,363
doesn't go through
the proper channels?

655
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:05,698
Well, that's a start.

656
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:07,407
You know Odo.

657
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,992
He enjoys thumbing his nose
at authority.

658
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,911
He files reports
when<i> he</i> feels like it.

659
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,163
His respect

660
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,414
for the chain of command
is minimal.

661
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,749
He gets the job done.

662
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:18,168
Starfleet<i> likes</i> team players.

663
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:20,796
Starfleet likes
the chain of command

664
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,756
and, frankly, so do I.

665
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:24,800
So you agree
with their decision?

666
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,926
No, but I understand it.

667
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,721
And when this mission is over,
you're just going to let him go?

668
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:31,097
Look, Major, I want him
to stay as much as you do,

669
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,349
but<i> he</i> has to want to stay.

670
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,017
T'RUL:
Bridge to Commander Sisko.

671
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,562
We've reached
the Callinon system.

672
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,271
On my way.

673
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,320
SISKO:
<i>Ship's Log, supplemental.</i>

674
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,946
<i>The</i> Defiant<i> has cloaked</i>

675
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:49,867
<i>and assumed standard orbit</i>
<i>around Callinon VII.</i>

676
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:51,493
<i>I plan to send Dax and O'Brien</i>

677
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,495
<i>down to survey the relay</i>
<i>station on the surface.</i>

678
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,414
According to our
sensor sweeps

679
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,541
it looks like Ornithar
was telling the truth

680
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,459
when he said the relay
station was unmanned.

681
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,796
It also appears there are very
few security measures in place.

682
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,172
Nothing fancy.

683
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,674
Get in, find what we
need and get out.

684
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:06,675
Understood.

685
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:08,594
On your way.

686
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:12,097
The transporter will need
six seconds to beam them down.

687
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,892
I want to de-cloak
for exactly six seconds.

688
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:16,101
Dax to Bridge.

689
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,561
We're ready, Benjamin.

690
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:18,729
All right.

691
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:20,731
Disengage cloak.

692
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:21,774
Energize.

693
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,319
They're on the surface.

694
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,405
Were we scanned
during transport?

695
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:29,698
I don't think so.

696
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:30,824
Dax to<i> Defiant.</i>

697
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:32,033
Go ahead, Dax.

698
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,786
We're in what seems to be

699
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:35,537
the central computer room.

700
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:38,164
The user interface
is a little unusual

701
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,292
but I think we
can access it.

702
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,960
SISKO:
Keep us posted.

703
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,298
I'm into the
main directory.

704
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:47,800
That was fast.

705
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,927
Yes, it was.

706
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:51,720
A bit too fast,
if you ask me.

707
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,388
Any indication
that we've tripped

708
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,223
some kind of
security protocol?

709
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:58,393
No, I still have
access to everything.

710
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,937
Then let's get
the information

711
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:00,979
and get out of here.

712
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,481
That's fine with me.

713
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,904
(<i> gasps</i> )

714
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:10,906

Quark up on his offer

715
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:12,031
for a new replicator.

716
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,032
Sir?

717
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,326
Nothing.

718
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,161
Let's make good use
of this time, Major.

719
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,663
Begin running a level-3
diagnostic...

720
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:18,872
Dax to<i> Defiant.</i>

721
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,624
I think we have something,
Benjamin.

722
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:22,918
We've accessed
a communications log

723
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,461
of outgoing
transmissions.

724
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:26,045
From the way
I read this, sir

725
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:28,047
it looks like 80% of
all outgoing traffic

726
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,716
is sent to one location.

727
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:33,595
It's my guess it's either
another relay station

728
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:34,763
or a command center.

729
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,389
SISKO:
Do you have the coordinates?

730
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,558
I'm sending them
to you now.

731
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:39,977
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

732
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:41,353
(<i> powering down</i> )

733
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,062
We've lost contact
with them.

734
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,189
Get them out of there!

735
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,732
I can't.

736
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,526
Some kind of shield has
appeared around the outpost.

737
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:48,568
I can't get through it.

738
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,487
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

739
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,157
We're picking up three
Jem'Hadar ships, Commander

740
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,408
heading this way.

741
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,243
Can we punch
through the security shield

742
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,745
with our phasers
before the ships get here?

743
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,205
I'm not sure.

744
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,665
I've never seen this
kind of field before.

745
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:02,875
T'RUL:
In order to use
the phasers

746
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:04,376
we will have to de-cloak.

747
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:05,878
That means, we'll be seen
by the Jem'Hadar.

748
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:07,295
Well, we've got to do something.

749
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,714
We can't just leave them there.

750
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,465
That's exactly
what we should do, Doctor.

751
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,633
Leave them.

752
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,510
We came here to locate
the Founders.

753
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,095
Not to fight
the Jem'Hadar

754
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,806
over two expendable
crew members.

755
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,224
No one is expendable.

756
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:20,559
KIRA:
The Jem'Hadar have
entered the system.

757
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,352
They'll be in orbit
in 30 seconds.

758
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,906
Prepare to leave orbit, Major.

759
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,032
Commander...

760
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:36,533
As you were, Doctor.

761
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:39,995
Lay in a course
to the coordinates Dax sent us.

762
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,583
Course laid in.

763
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,377
Warp 7. Engage.

764
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,475
(<i> sighs</i> )

765
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:06,646
What do you think will happen
to Dax and O'Brien?

766
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:09,691
They'll probably be held
for interrogation.

767
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:12,444
If I know Dax,
she'll use the opportunity

768
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:15,614
to try to contact the Founders,
and I intend to do the same.

769
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,909
Sisko to Odo.
Report to the Bridge, Constable.

770
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:21,327
I want to discuss the security
arrangements for our...

771
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,872
ODO:
I'm presently indisposed,
Commander.

772
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,999
Please find someone else
for the job.

773
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:27,626
That doesn't sound like Odo.

774
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:28,877
No, it doesn't.

775
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:31,088
I'd better have a talk with him.

776
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:32,464
Uh, let me, sir.

777
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:35,008
I think he'll listen to me.

778
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:38,470
Three Jem'Hadar ships
have just entered sensor range.

779
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,139
Bearing 037 mark 215.

780
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,891
Is there any sign
they've detected us?

781
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,225
Negative.

782
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,185
Bring us out of warp
and then cut main power.

783
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,771
We'll wait here
until they pass.

784
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:51,733
(<i> door chimes</i> )

785
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:55,320
(<i> door chimes</i> )

786
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:01,159
Odo, it's time
we had a talk.

787
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:05,664
I'm not going to the Bridge,
so you can save your breath.

788
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:09,334
And I'd appreciate being
left alone right now.

789
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:13,046
Well, you tried being alone
and it hasn't done any good.

790
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:16,883
So maybe it's time to stop
brooding and start talking.

791
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,428
Are you the ship's counselor
now?

792
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:24,265
No... I'm your friend.

793
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,267
You know, the one
who comes to you

794
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,352
when she needs help.

795
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,941
I'm just trying
to return the favor.

796
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:36,235
Well, you can return the favor

797
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,989
by giving me a shuttlecraft
and letting me go.

798
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:42,117
Go? Go where?

799
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:43,576
We're in the heart
of the Dominion.

800
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:46,245
Where the hell do you think
you're gonna go?

801
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:49,582
The Omarion Nebula.

802
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,712
Why?

803
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:56,464
I'm not sure why.

804
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,759
I just know I have to,
that's all.

805
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:04,347
Y-You... you're going to have
to do a lot better than that.

806
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,435
Odo...

807
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,687
talk to me.

808
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:13,356
Tell me what's going on.

809
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:21,531
Ever since we've come
into the Gamma Quadrant...

810
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:26,411
I've had this feeling...
of being drawn somewhere

811
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:32,834
pulled by some instinct
to a specific place--

812
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,838
the Omarion Nebula.

813
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:39,257
Why there?

814
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,299
(<i> snorts</i> )

815
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:42,094
I don't know.

816
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,805
All right.

817
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:48,808
Once we've contacted
the Founders

818
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,227
I'm sure Commander Sisko...

819
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:51,895
No!

820
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:54,981
Not<i> after</i> we've contacted
the Founders--<i> now!</i>

821
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,733
I have to leave<i> now!</i>

822
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:59,485
Look, I understand
this is important to you

823
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,029
but we have a mission to...

824
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,114
(<i> explosion</i> )

825
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,785
Direct hit on the port nacelle!

826
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,079
How did they see through
the cloaking device?

827
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,872
They might have analyzed
the sensor information

828
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,498
on the anti-proton scan

829
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:15,334
and found a way
to penetrate the cloak.

830
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,545
We'll have to save
the speculation for later.

831
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:21,133
Disengage the cloak, raise the
shields and fire on my command!

832
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:38,233
Communications
and long-range sensors are out!

833
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,235
What's the status
of the warp drive?

834
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,820
The starboard power coupling
is destroyed!

835
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,904
I'm trying

836
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,239
to reroute main power!

837
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,741
(<i> yelling</i> )

838
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,038
He's gone!

839
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,165
I'll take the helm!

840
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,542
Locking onto the lead ship!

841
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:57,961
Ready?
Ready!

842
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,045
Fire!

843
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:07,804
The other two are moving
out of phaser range.

844
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:10,682
They're coming back
for another pass.

845
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:13,185
They're moving
a little slower now.

846
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:15,394
They'll be
more cautious this time.

847
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,814
Doctor, use
evasive pattern delta-5.

848
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:19,816
We need to keep
them off balance

849
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:20,942
until we get
warp power back.

850
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,027
Aye, sir.

851
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,700
Are you all right?

852
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,742
Just a few bruises.

853
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,661
Kira to Bridge.

854
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:33,621
Kira to Bridge!

855
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,166
We have to get up there.

856
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,878
T'Rul, where's my warp power?

857
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:42,130
I can't get the phase inducers
to align

858
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,464
with the ODN matrixes!

859
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,591
Commander, three more
Jem'Hadar warships

860
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:46,968
approaching off the port bow!

861
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:49,346
Full impulse!
Get us out of here!

862
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,682
We've lost main power.

863
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,934
We've got to get
to a shuttle.

864
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,520
Our duty is to get to the Bridge
and help defend the ship.

865
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,813
If main power is out

866
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,732
then the shields
are out, Kira.

867
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:02,150
The ship is
defenseless!

868
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,442
(<i> grunts</i> )

869
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,997
Main power is off-line!

870
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,375
The shields have collapsed!

871
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,335
I've lost helm control.

872
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:22,754
Inertial dampers failing.

873
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:23,963
Ready escape pods.

874
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,965
Prepare to abandon ship.

875

877
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,082
(<i> grunting</i> )

00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:19,018
(<i> ship controls</i>
<i>beeping quietly</i> )

879
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,859
Where am I?

880
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,989
You're in a shuttlecraft.

881
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,615
You were wounded.

882
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,993
Try not to move around.

883
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,876
Odo, what happened?

884
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,711
We were under attack.

885
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:49,257
The ship was boarded.

886
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:51,884
You were wounded
in the attack.

887
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:54,762
I managed to get us
to the shuttlecraft

888
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,890
but I don't know
much more than that.

889
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,393
The last time
I saw the<i> Defiant</i>

890
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:03,229
she was dead in space
and surrounded

891
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:06,316
by Jem'Hadar ships.

892
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:08,193
Sisko? Bashir?

893
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,737
I don't know.

894
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,501
Where are we?

895
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:29,005
We're approaching
the Omarion Nebula.

896
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:31,216
You should have taken us
back to the wormhole.

897
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:34,302
You didn't object
at the time.

898
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:36,179
I was unconscious.

899
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:43,395
You found anything?

900
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:45,397
(<i> sighs</i> )

901
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,445
That's a Class-M planet.

902
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:53,863
No star system.

903
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,448
A rogue planet?

904
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:57,534
Yes.

905
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:30,567
(<i> liquid lapping</i> )

906
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:22,619
Welcome home.
