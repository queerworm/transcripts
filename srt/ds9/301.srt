1
00:00:02,264 --> 00:00:05,169
Last time on
<i>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...</i>

2
00:00:05,237 --> 00:00:07,731
If you could do any
science project you wanted to

3
00:00:07,777 --> 00:00:09,508
anything at all...

4
00:00:09,547 --> 00:00:11,176
Visit the Gamma Quadrant?

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,147
We've never heard
of the Jem'Hadar.

6
00:00:25,185 --> 00:00:26,779
Then you've been fortunate.

7
00:00:26,822 --> 00:00:30,729
Negotiations with the Dominion
can be a dangerous thing.

8
00:00:33,237 --> 00:00:35,231
The Dominion will
no longer stand by

9
00:00:35,276 --> 00:00:39,012
and allow ships from your side
to violate our territory.

10
00:00:39,052 --> 00:00:40,681
Starfleet's orders are simple.

11
00:00:40,723 --> 00:00:42,785
Traffic through the wormhole
will be suspended

12
00:00:42,828 --> 00:00:44,263
until the <i>Odyssey</i>
can investigate

13
00:00:44,298 --> 00:00:45,665
the Jem'Hadar's threat.

14
00:00:45,701 --> 00:00:47,193
What about Benjamin
and the others?

15
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:48,867
Don't worry, Lieutenant.

16
00:00:48,908 --> 00:00:51,277
Commander Sisko's return
is a top priority.

17
00:00:51,348 --> 00:00:52,840
If you're going to try
to rescue them

18
00:00:52,885 --> 00:00:54,013
then we're coming with you.

19
00:01:04,546 --> 00:01:05,640
Here they come.

20
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,600
Major, one
of the Jem'Hadar ships

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,109
is making a direct run
at the <i>Odyssey.</i>

22
00:01:24,327 --> 00:01:26,993
The Jem'Hadar wanted us
to escape, didn't they?

23
00:01:27,034 --> 00:01:29,666
You have no idea
what's begun here.

24
00:01:31,511 --> 00:01:32,946
She'll be back.

25
00:01:32,981 --> 00:01:35,214
The question is
who she'll bring with her.

26
00:01:35,253 --> 00:01:38,158
If the Dominion
comes through the wormhole

27
00:01:38,193 --> 00:01:40,664
the first battle
will be fought here

28
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,004
and I intend
to be ready for them.

29
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,877
And now, the continuation.

30
00:01:57,606 --> 00:02:00,043
We're in trouble, people.

31
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,315
We've run seven simulations
and they all come out the same.

32
00:02:03,353 --> 00:02:05,221
The Jem'Hadar
overwhelm our defenses

33
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,320
and board the station
within two hours.

34
00:02:07,363 --> 00:02:09,128
Two hours doesn't even
give us time

35
00:02:09,168 --> 00:02:10,831
to get reinforcements
from Bajor.

36
00:02:10,872 --> 00:02:13,002
There must be something
we overlooked.

37
00:02:13,044 --> 00:02:15,515
Major, I'm the last one
to say it's hopeless

38
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,021
but given DS9's
structural limitations

39
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:19,525
our available power supply

40
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:22,123
and the difficulty of defending
a stationary target

41
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,931
against a heavily
armed mobile force

42
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,838
I'd say two hours is optimistic.

43
00:02:25,874 --> 00:02:27,207
Well, regardless of the time

44
00:02:27,244 --> 00:02:28,804
the casualties
would be appalling.

45
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:31,480
All right, let's say we let
them board the station.

46
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:33,389
That still doesn't mean
we have to surrender.

47
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:34,860
What are you suggesting?

48
00:02:34,896 --> 00:02:37,197
We can, uh...

49
00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:40,607
we can hide in the conduits,
set up booby traps

50
00:02:40,644 --> 00:02:42,877
prepare ambushes...
try and hold out

51
00:02:42,915 --> 00:02:44,943
until we can get
reinforcements.

52
00:02:44,987 --> 00:02:46,422
We can try,
but I don't think

53
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,086
there'd be
much of a station left

54
00:02:48,128 --> 00:02:49,427
by the time they got here.

55
00:02:49,531 --> 00:02:51,764
That leaves us
with two options...

56
00:02:51,803 --> 00:02:55,039
abandon the station
and make a stand on Bajor.

57
00:02:55,078 --> 00:02:59,612
Or... collapse the entrance
to the wormhole.

58
00:02:59,655 --> 00:03:01,090
No, I want a third alternative.

59
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,617
I cannot believe
that we can't...

60
00:03:06,572 --> 00:03:09,944
Some kind of large subspace
surge has just activated

61
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,039
our security sensors.

62
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,051
Where is it?

63
00:03:12,086 --> 00:03:14,148
Bearing 148 mark 215.

64
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,887
Distance 300 meters.

65
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:17,420
300 meters?

66
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:20,165
That's almost inside
our shield perimeter.

67
00:03:20,205 --> 00:03:23,042
From the intensity
in the harmonic signature

68
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,741
it could be a cloaked ship

69
00:03:24,782 --> 00:03:27,880
but I've never seen an energy
dispersal pattern like this.

70
00:03:27,923 --> 00:03:29,654
It's too close for comfort,
whatever it is.

71
00:03:29,694 --> 00:03:30,662
Red Alert.

72
00:03:30,697 --> 00:03:31,665
Raise shields.

73
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:33,066
Energize phaser banks.

74
00:03:33,102 --> 00:03:34,196
Stand by to lock
photon torpedoes.

75
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,472
The energy
signature's fluctuating.

76
00:03:36,544 --> 00:03:37,603
It's de-cloaking.

77
00:03:43,694 --> 00:03:45,790
It's definitely
a Federation starship

78
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,770
but I've never seen
that design before.

79
00:03:47,804 --> 00:03:50,241
A Federation ship
with a cloaking device?

80
00:03:50,277 --> 00:03:51,507
It's hailing us.

81
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,913
On screen.

82
00:03:53,718 --> 00:03:54,846
Hello, Major.

83
00:03:54,887 --> 00:03:56,379
Sorry to startle you,
but I wanted

84
00:03:56,425 --> 00:03:58,122
to test the <i>Defiant's</i>
cloaking device.

85
00:03:58,162 --> 00:03:59,927
The <i>Defiant?</i>

86
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:03,098
I've brought back a little
surprise for the Dominion.

87
00:06:08,238 --> 00:06:11,405
Officially, it's classified
as an escort vessel.

88
00:06:11,445 --> 00:06:15,011
Unofficially,
the <i>Defiant's</i> a warship...

89
00:06:15,053 --> 00:06:17,582
nothing more, nothing less.

90
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,791
I thought Starfleet
didn't believe in warships.

91
00:06:19,832 --> 00:06:22,999
Desperate times breed
desperate measures, Major.

92
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,845
Five years ago, Starfleet
began exploring the possibility

93
00:06:26,882 --> 00:06:29,251
of building
a new class of starship.

94
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:32,193
This ship would have
no families, no science labs

95
00:06:32,228 --> 00:06:34,222
no luxuries of any kind.

96
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:36,430
It was designed
for one purpose only...

97
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:38,567
to fight and defeat the Borg.

98
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,341
The <i>Defiant</i> was a prototype.

99
00:06:40,381 --> 00:06:42,443
The first ship
in what would have been

100
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:43,887
a new Federation battle fleet.

101
00:06:43,923 --> 00:06:45,324
So what happened?

102
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,558
The Borg threat
became less urgent.

103
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:49,729
Also, some design flaws
cropped up

104
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,173
during the ship's
shakedown cruise

105
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:54,646
so Starfleet decided
to abandon the project.

106
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:56,174
What sort of design flaws?

107
00:06:56,219 --> 00:06:59,523
You'll have complete access
to the ship evaluation reports

108
00:06:59,561 --> 00:07:01,657
but, to put it simply,
it's overgunned

109
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:03,727
and overpowered
for a ship its size.

110
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,709
During battle drills,
it nearly tore itself apart

111
00:07:06,745 --> 00:07:08,739
when the engines were tested
at full capacity.

112
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:11,584
And this is the ship
that Starfleet sends us

113
00:07:11,622 --> 00:07:13,285
to fight off an attack
by the Dominion?

114
00:07:13,327 --> 00:07:16,232
We're not going to fight
the Dominion, Major

115
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:17,930
at least, not yet anyway.

116
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:21,936
Our mission is to take the
<i>Defiant</i> into the Gamma Quadrant

117
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:25,752
and try to find the leaders
of the Dominion, the Founders.

118
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,419
We have to convince them
that the Federation

119
00:07:27,461 --> 00:07:28,794
does not represent
a threat to them.

120
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,701
What if they don't believe us?

121
00:07:31,738 --> 00:07:34,232
That's why I asked
for the <i>Defiant.</i>

122
00:07:34,277 --> 00:07:36,943
She may have flaws,
but she has teeth

123
00:07:36,984 --> 00:07:39,251
and I want the Dominion to know

124
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:43,094
that we can and will defend
ourselves, if necessary.

125
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:46,832
I've posted
two security officers

126
00:07:46,874 --> 00:07:49,642
at the <i>Defiant's</i>
docking port, sir.

127
00:07:49,681 --> 00:07:51,207
No one will get near
the cloaking device

128
00:07:51,251 --> 00:07:52,345
without us knowing about it.

129
00:07:52,387 --> 00:07:53,788
I wasn't informed

130
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:56,523
about any special
security arrangements.

131
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:59,263
The security arrangements
were by my request

132
00:07:59,303 --> 00:08:01,740
to protect the cloaking device.

133
00:08:01,777 --> 00:08:03,406
A few introductions
are in order.

134
00:08:03,447 --> 00:08:05,976
This is Subcommander T'Rul,
from the Romulan Empire.

135
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,081
She's here to operate
the cloaking device

136
00:08:08,124 --> 00:08:09,286
which her government

137
00:08:09,327 --> 00:08:11,491
so kindly loaned us
for this mission.

138
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:14,506
Romulan interests will be
served through cooperation

139
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,069
and my role is to keep
unauthorized personnel

140
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:18,844
away from the cloaking device.

141
00:08:18,883 --> 00:08:20,375
May I present my officers.

142
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:21,515
This is Major Ki...

143
00:08:21,557 --> 00:08:23,960
Thank you,
but I know their names

144
00:08:23,996 --> 00:08:26,365
and I'm not here
to make friends.

145
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:30,977
Charming.

146
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:33,780
Well, I am here to make friends.

147
00:08:33,819 --> 00:08:37,624
I'm Lieutenant Commander
Michael Eddington

148
00:08:37,662 --> 00:08:39,393
Starfleet Security.

149
00:08:39,433 --> 00:08:41,836
Major Kira Nerys.

150
00:08:45,515 --> 00:08:49,251
Odo, Head of Station Security.

151
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,628
May I ask what your function
is here, Commander?

152
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,693
There will be
a complete mission briefing

153
00:08:54,737 --> 00:08:56,400
at 1800 hours, but be prepared

154
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,106
to depart the station
at 0700 tomorrow morning.

155
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:00,309
Dismissed.

156
00:09:06,698 --> 00:09:08,292
You needn't brace yourself

157
00:09:08,336 --> 00:09:10,705
to give me
unpleasant news, Commander.

158
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:12,370
I'll save you the trouble.

159
00:09:12,412 --> 00:09:15,351
I've been relieved
as Chief of Security.

160
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:20,263
Odo, wait!

161
00:09:20,297 --> 00:09:21,265
You've not been relieved.

162
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,599
You're still in charge

163
00:09:22,637 --> 00:09:24,767
of all non-Starfleet security
matters aboard this station.

164
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:26,905
And what about matters
that are Starfleet?

165
00:09:26,947 --> 00:09:28,610
In those areas,
you coordinate your efforts

166
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,641
with Commander Eddington.

167
00:09:29,686 --> 00:09:31,589
"Coordinate" is
another way of saying

168
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,650
I'll report to him.

169
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:35,958
I'm sorry, Odo.

170
00:09:36,068 --> 00:09:37,367
This wasn't my idea.

171
00:09:37,405 --> 00:09:38,704
I'm sure it wasn't.

172
00:09:38,742 --> 00:09:40,302
You were just
following orders.

173
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:42,441
An order I strongly
disagreed with.

174
00:09:42,484 --> 00:09:45,116
I did everything
I could to fight this.

175
00:09:45,157 --> 00:09:46,319
I even took it

176
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,524
to the Chief of Starfleet
Security herself

177
00:09:48,565 --> 00:09:50,296
but the decision was final.

178
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:52,364
May I ask why?

179
00:09:52,408 --> 00:09:53,433
There were some concerns

180
00:09:53,477 --> 00:09:56,075
about several recent
security breaches.

181
00:09:57,286 --> 00:09:59,655
If I was given
the authority I asked for

182
00:09:59,692 --> 00:10:02,460
instead of being tied
to Starfleet regulations

183
00:10:02,498 --> 00:10:05,335
there wouldn't have been
any security breaches.

184
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,366
Odo, your resistance to
following Starfleet regulations

185
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,039
is part of the problem.

186
00:10:09,082 --> 00:10:12,545
Well, I think there might be a
simpler explanation, Commander.

187
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:14,492
I think Starfleet
decided to bring in

188
00:10:14,527 --> 00:10:16,019
someone they could trust...

189
00:10:16,064 --> 00:10:20,063
someone besides
"the shape-shifter."

190
00:10:20,108 --> 00:10:23,344
This is not a racial issue, Odo.

191
00:10:23,383 --> 00:10:25,650
I understand
how you must feel, and I...

192
00:10:25,688 --> 00:10:26,987
Commander.

193
00:10:27,024 --> 00:10:29,997
I don't require
your understanding.

194
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:34,030
My resignation will be logged
within the hour.

195
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,138
Hey, hey, hey...

196
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:48,799
I thought you were unpacking.

197
00:10:48,843 --> 00:10:49,937
I am.
I mean, I was.

198
00:10:49,979 --> 00:10:52,679
But I just kept looking
at the replicator and...

199
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:55,088
And you just had to have
some I'danian spice pudding.

200
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,150
You know, I still can't believe

201
00:10:56,227 --> 00:10:57,719
I couldn't get a decent bowl
back on Earth.

202
00:10:57,765 --> 00:10:59,827
That didn't stop you
from ordering it

203
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,464
at every replicator you saw.

204
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:03,101
So...

205
00:11:03,144 --> 00:11:04,738
is it good to be home?

206
00:11:04,781 --> 00:11:05,909
Yeah.

207
00:11:05,951 --> 00:11:07,979
I can't wait to sleep
in my own bed again.

208
00:11:09,024 --> 00:11:10,618
Whew.

209
00:11:10,662 --> 00:11:13,294
I wonder when that happened.

210
00:11:13,335 --> 00:11:14,804
What?

211
00:11:14,838 --> 00:11:19,338
When did I start thinking
of this Cardassian monstrosity

212
00:11:19,383 --> 00:11:21,479
as home?

213
00:11:21,522 --> 00:11:23,686
I think it happened...

214
00:11:23,727 --> 00:11:25,253
last Thursday.

215
00:11:25,297 --> 00:11:28,361
Around 1700 hours...

216
00:11:28,404 --> 00:11:31,502
when you took all of this stuff
out of storage back on Earth.

217
00:11:31,546 --> 00:11:34,747
I... Careful, that's
a 2,000-year-old Yoruba mask

218
00:11:34,786 --> 00:11:37,759
and that "stuff" is one
of the finest collections

219
00:11:37,794 --> 00:11:39,024
of ancient African art...

220
00:11:39,063 --> 00:11:40,692
You'll ever see.

221
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:41,828
I know.

222
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,205
And I also know
how much it means to you.

223
00:11:44,276 --> 00:11:46,179
But, to me, this will always be

224
00:11:46,213 --> 00:11:48,650
the stuff in your library...
at home.

225
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:52,492
When you took it out of storage
so you could bring it here

226
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:55,229
it meant that Earth
wasn't home anymore.

227
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:57,206
This was.

228
00:12:01,951 --> 00:12:03,045
So...

229
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,917
what do you think?

230
00:12:07,098 --> 00:12:08,397
Perfect.

231
00:12:19,927 --> 00:12:20,952
Odo.

232
00:12:20,997 --> 00:12:22,159
There you are.

233
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,934
I just finished talking
to the provisional government

234
00:12:24,974 --> 00:12:27,503
and they want you to go with us
to the Gamma Quadrant tomorrow

235
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,449
to act as an official
Bajoran representative.

236
00:12:30,453 --> 00:12:31,421
I'm no diplomat.

237
00:12:31,456 --> 00:12:32,424
I know.

238
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,395
That's why they want you to go.

239
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,660
If we do locate the Founders

240
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,431
we're going to need
more than diplomacy.

241
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,996
We're going to need
to size them up

242
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,475
see what kind
of threat they pose

243
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,500
to Bajor, analyze...

244
00:12:41,547 --> 00:12:44,384
You're the military
expert, Major, not me.

245
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,690
And I doubt

246
00:12:47,728 --> 00:12:50,462
that the provisional
government contacted you

247
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:54,169
and asked for my presence
on this mission.

248
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,163
If I'm not mistaken

249
00:12:55,297 --> 00:12:58,703
this is a misguided attempt
to make me feel better.

250
00:12:58,739 --> 00:13:01,108
Maybe it is.

251
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,185
Maybe I'm your friend.

252
00:13:05,221 --> 00:13:06,952
And maybe I want you to see

253
00:13:06,992 --> 00:13:09,088
that you are still
needed here...

254
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:14,234
no matter what some idiot
Starfleet admiral might think.

255
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:29,177
The <i>Defiant</i> leaves at 700 hours.

256
00:13:44,247 --> 00:13:48,383
I'm a little confused,
Commander.

257
00:13:48,424 --> 00:13:52,092
You want me to go with you
to the Gamma Quadrant

258
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:55,334
to help you locate
the Founders.

259
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:58,975
See? It's not
so confusing after all.

260
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,815
You're joking with me,
aren't you?

261
00:14:00,855 --> 00:14:02,347
Having a little fun with Quark.

262
00:14:02,392 --> 00:14:03,554
I'm quite serious.

263
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:04,653
You can't be.

264
00:14:04,697 --> 00:14:06,030
I'm not a diplomat

265
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:08,699
or an explorer
or a tactical officer

266
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,474
or whatever else you
might need on this trip.

267
00:14:11,513 --> 00:14:14,817
Now, if you need a caterer,
I'd be happy to loan you

268
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,087
a new replicator
that I just got...

269
00:14:17,126 --> 00:14:19,461
Eight months ago,
you helped the Nagus

270
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:22,631
establish a trade agreement
with the Karemma, uh...

271
00:14:22,673 --> 00:14:25,271
tulaberry wine, I believe.

272
00:14:25,313 --> 00:14:27,716
The Karemma are
part of the Dominion.

273
00:14:27,752 --> 00:14:29,882
A minor part...
a very minor part.

274
00:14:29,924 --> 00:14:31,484
They might still
be able to help us

275
00:14:31,527 --> 00:14:32,894
make contact with the Founders.

276
00:14:32,931 --> 00:14:35,334
Since you're experienced
in dealing with the Karemma,

277
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,534
it seems to me that you're
the logical person...

278
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,604
Actually, my brother Rom
did most of the talking.

279
00:14:39,647 --> 00:14:41,880
I think he'd be better suited
for this mission.

280
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,650
Not Rom... you.

281
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,680
But why?

282
00:14:44,726 --> 00:14:47,460
Rom only has a son
to think about.

283
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,026
I have a business.

284
00:14:50,038 --> 00:14:51,063
You.

285
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:58,022
I'm sorry, Commander,
but I must refuse.

286
00:14:58,058 --> 00:15:00,656
My last experience
with the Jem'Hadar

287
00:15:00,697 --> 00:15:02,223
was not a pleasant one

288
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:05,002
and I have no intention
of repeating it.

289
00:15:05,108 --> 00:15:09,984
Now, there's no way you can
legally force me to do this.

290
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:17,128
The scepter of the Grand Nagus.

291
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:20,041
I had a chance to discuss
this mission with him

292
00:15:20,144 --> 00:15:21,807
on my way back from Earth.

293
00:15:21,848 --> 00:15:23,147
He seemed to agree with me.

294
00:15:23,185 --> 00:15:24,313
Unless peaceful contact

295
00:15:24,354 --> 00:15:26,325
can be established
with the Founders

296
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,660
business opportunities
in the Gamma Quadrant

297
00:15:28,698 --> 00:15:30,031
might suddenly dry up.

298
00:15:30,068 --> 00:15:34,774
He also agreed with me that you
are the perfect man to help me.

299
00:15:34,813 --> 00:15:36,841
I don't believe it.

300
00:15:36,884 --> 00:15:38,251
Which is why he sent this along.

301
00:15:38,288 --> 00:15:39,655
He thought it might convince you

302
00:15:39,691 --> 00:15:44,533
of the high value he holds
for the success of this mission.

303
00:15:45,672 --> 00:15:47,039
Now...

304
00:15:47,075 --> 00:15:48,943
are you going to defy

305
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,421
the wishes of the Grand Nagus
himself?

306
00:15:52,455 --> 00:15:54,118
No, no... of course not.

307
00:15:54,192 --> 00:15:57,256
I'm happy to serve the Nagus
any way I can.

308
00:15:57,299 --> 00:15:58,267
Thanks, Quark.

309
00:15:58,302 --> 00:15:59,828
I knew I could count on you.

310
00:15:59,873 --> 00:16:01,342
Yeah.

311
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,708
Quark?

312
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:06,654
Aren't you forgetting something?

313
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,952
Oh.

314
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:40,162
I just thought
you'd like to know.

315
00:16:40,236 --> 00:16:42,264
The <i>Defiant</i> will be
ready at 0700 hours.

316
00:16:42,307 --> 00:16:43,742
Did it pass
the Chief's inspection?

317
00:16:43,778 --> 00:16:44,803
Does anything?

318
00:16:44,847 --> 00:16:46,750
His maintenance list
is as long as this table.

319
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:48,848
But he did say it will
take us where we're going.

320
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,954
And back, I hope.

321
00:16:51,998 --> 00:16:53,866
Well, he said
that was up to you.

322
00:16:53,902 --> 00:16:56,305
I'd never have volunteered
for this mission

323
00:16:56,341 --> 00:16:59,212
if I didn't think we had
a chance of coming back.

324
00:16:59,248 --> 00:17:01,481
How many times
did Curzon tell you

325
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,423
never volunteer for anything?

326
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:06,955
As I recall, Curzon broke
that rule a few times himself.

327
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,028
And regretted it every time.

328
00:17:09,072 --> 00:17:10,666
This is different.

329
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:12,703
I'd be regretting it even more

330
00:17:12,747 --> 00:17:15,515
if we just waited around
for an invasion.

331
00:17:21,335 --> 00:17:24,001
If I know Starfleet,
they must have run

332
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:28,313
at least 200 probability studies
on this mission of ours.

333
00:17:28,352 --> 00:17:31,223
So what are the odds
of us succeeding?

334
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,196
Slim.

335
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:37,531
But better odds
than fighting off

336
00:17:37,574 --> 00:17:39,943
a Jem'Hadar assault
on this station.

337
00:17:39,979 --> 00:17:42,781
And if the station falls,
then Bajor falls

338
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:44,949
and I will not let that happen.

339
00:17:47,397 --> 00:17:50,701
You know, after Jennifer died

340
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:53,939
I never thought I would
see you this passionate

341
00:17:53,979 --> 00:17:55,642
about something again.

342
00:17:55,684 --> 00:17:59,147
Two months ago, I would
have agreed with you.

343
00:17:59,192 --> 00:18:01,220
Then I went back to Earth

344
00:18:01,264 --> 00:18:04,431
and I spent all
those weeks debriefing

345
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:06,738
at Starfleet Headquarters.

346
00:18:06,776 --> 00:18:07,835
And I...

347
00:18:09,717 --> 00:18:13,385
I used to get a thrill
just walking into that building.

348
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,522
I'd look around at the admirals

349
00:18:15,565 --> 00:18:18,402
and think, "One day,
that's going to be me.

350
00:18:18,438 --> 00:18:19,805
"One day, I'm the one

351
00:18:19,842 --> 00:18:22,872
that's going to be making
the big decisions."

352
00:18:24,586 --> 00:18:26,955
Curzon always thought
that was very funny.

353
00:18:26,992 --> 00:18:27,960
Did he?

354
00:18:27,994 --> 00:18:29,293
What I mean is

355
00:18:29,398 --> 00:18:33,305
he could never see a set of
admiral stars on your collar.

356
00:18:33,374 --> 00:18:36,245
He thought that just
making the decisions

357
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,978
would never satisfy you.

358
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:39,955
You had to implement them...

359
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,160
see the results,
face the consequences.

360
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,538
Curzon always thought
you were the kind of man

361
00:18:47,574 --> 00:18:50,172
who had to be
in the thick of things...

362
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:53,187
not behind some desk
at Headquarters.

363
00:18:56,496 --> 00:19:00,939
He was a smart old man,
wasn't he?

364
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,444
He'd like to think so.

365
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,627
You'd better get
a good night's sleep.

366
00:19:10,663 --> 00:19:13,659
I was just about to say
the same thing to you.

367
00:19:13,704 --> 00:19:16,198
I'll see you
in the morning, Benjamin.

368
00:19:27,938 --> 00:19:30,502
The medical database
is practically nonexistent.

369
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,138
I've downloaded
as many of my files

370
00:19:32,182 --> 00:19:33,378
from the station as I can

371
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:35,080
but this ship
simply wasn't designed

372
00:19:35,122 --> 00:19:36,386
to handle many casualties.

373
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,985
Do the best you can,
and let's hope we don't

374
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:39,897
have to put your new
database to a test.

375
00:19:39,934 --> 00:19:41,062
Yes, sir.

376
00:19:41,102 --> 00:19:42,537
Quark's settling
into his quarters

377
00:19:42,573 --> 00:19:46,515
and asked me to relay to you
his profound disappointment

378
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:48,986
in the accommodations,
and to inform you

379
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,422
that he could
get you in touch

380
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:52,587
with several reputable
interior decorators

381
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,156
for a modest fee.

382
00:19:54,201 --> 00:19:56,399
I'll take his offer
under advisement.

383
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,205
Stand by to get underway.

384
00:19:58,244 --> 00:20:00,442
Tactical and communications
are ready, sir.

385
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:02,713
Navigation and operations,
ready.

386
00:20:02,755 --> 00:20:03,651
Weapons ready.

387
00:20:03,784 --> 00:20:05,151
Impulse engines on-line.

388
00:20:05,188 --> 00:20:06,555
Warp power available
at your command.

389
00:20:06,591 --> 00:20:08,220
Very well.

390
00:20:08,261 --> 00:20:11,029
Seal the airlock,
release docking clamps, aft...

391
00:20:11,068 --> 00:20:12,799
Just a moment, sir.

392
00:20:12,873 --> 00:20:15,812
There's someone in the airlock.

393
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:17,111
It's Odo.

394
00:20:19,388 --> 00:20:20,447
Sisko to Odo.

395
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:22,428
Is there a problem, Constable?

396
00:20:22,462 --> 00:20:25,925
No, Commander. I would like
permission to come aboard.

397
00:20:25,971 --> 00:20:31,075
I'm here at the request
of the Bajoran government.

398
00:20:31,116 --> 00:20:32,449
Permission granted.

399
00:20:32,486 --> 00:20:34,480
Thank you, sir.

400
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:37,293
Dax, we'll have to arrange
some quarters for the Constable.

401
00:20:37,331 --> 00:20:38,527
I'll do it, sir.

402
00:20:38,568 --> 00:20:41,507
I need to go down to what is
laughingly called the Sick Bay.

403
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:42,601
Thank you, Doctor.

404
00:20:42,644 --> 00:20:43,874
Odo's aboard, sir.

405
00:20:43,947 --> 00:20:45,143
The airlock's clear.

406
00:20:45,184 --> 00:20:46,585
Release docking clamps.

407
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,385
Aft thrusters at one quarter.

408
00:20:48,424 --> 00:20:50,759
Port and starboard
at station keeping.

409
00:21:07,637 --> 00:21:09,266
We've cleared the station.

410
00:21:09,308 --> 00:21:11,336
Lay in a course
to the wormhole.

411
00:21:11,379 --> 00:21:13,213
I want to cloak as soon as
we reach the Gamma Quadrant.

412
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:14,413
Understood.

413
00:21:15,656 --> 00:21:17,524
Course laid in, sir.

414
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:19,589
Engage.

415
00:21:43,757 --> 00:21:48,223
The cloaking device is operating
within normal parameters.

416
00:21:48,268 --> 00:21:50,866
Set course
for the Karemma system.

417
00:21:50,908 --> 00:21:51,967
Warp 7.

418
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:52,978
Aye, sir.

419
00:21:53,013 --> 00:21:54,346
Engage.

420
00:21:57,457 --> 00:21:58,516
Odo!

421
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:04,765
Is this the best you can do?

422
00:22:04,807 --> 00:22:06,367
I'm afraid so.

423
00:22:06,411 --> 00:22:08,882
Most of the crew quarters
don't have life supports yet.

424
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:11,184
Besides, I think
we'd all feel a bit better

425
00:22:11,223 --> 00:22:13,251
with someone here
to watch over Quark.

426
00:22:13,294 --> 00:22:16,791
I take that
as a personal insult, Doctor.

427
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,499
You should.

428
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,638
Now, I think
I'll let you two bunkmates

429
00:22:21,681 --> 00:22:23,412
get more comfortable.

430
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,720
Am I glad to see you.

431
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,824
I have been stuck
down here in this miserable hole

432
00:22:29,867 --> 00:22:31,530
ever since I came on board.

433
00:22:31,572 --> 00:22:32,597
Bunk beds!

434
00:22:32,641 --> 00:22:33,803
No view.

435
00:22:33,844 --> 00:22:36,008
And I can't tell
you what came out

436
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:39,147
of that replicator when
I asked for synthehol.

437
00:22:41,495 --> 00:22:42,759
So...

438
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:45,794
what's your role
in this little adventure?

439
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,369
Providing security, no doubt.

440
00:22:48,412 --> 00:22:50,508
Well, of course you are.

441
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,648
I mean, why else
would you be here?

442
00:22:53,691 --> 00:22:56,060
I can tell you,
I feel much safer now

443
00:22:56,097 --> 00:22:58,934
just knowing you're along,
because I know...

444
00:22:58,971 --> 00:23:03,745
I have been holding
this shape for 16 hours.

445
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,949
I have to revert back
to my liquid state

446
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:10,658
but I don't want you to watch
and gawk at me!

447
00:23:10,698 --> 00:23:14,469
I understand, completely.

448
00:23:16,012 --> 00:23:19,509
This is a very private moment
and I won't interfere.

449
00:23:24,331 --> 00:23:25,994
This won't be so bad...

450
00:23:28,608 --> 00:23:31,809
I have no interest
in speaking to you

451
00:23:31,849 --> 00:23:35,312
or in listening
to your witless prattle!

452
00:23:35,358 --> 00:23:37,226
So stay out of my way

453
00:23:37,262 --> 00:23:40,896
or you'll regret
the day you ever met me!

454
00:23:55,941 --> 00:23:57,775
Commander, long-range sensors

455
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:01,308
have picked up two Jem'Hadar
warships directly ahead.

456
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:03,847
They're heading
this way at warp 5.

457
00:24:03,893 --> 00:24:06,023
How close will they pass us?

458
00:24:06,065 --> 00:24:07,534
100,000 kilometers.

459
00:24:07,568 --> 00:24:10,405
That's well within range
of their weapons, Commander.

460
00:24:10,442 --> 00:24:12,207
Should I alter course?

461
00:24:12,246 --> 00:24:15,117
No, we need to know if they can
see through the cloaking device

462
00:24:15,186 --> 00:24:16,712
and this is
as good a time as any.

463
00:24:16,757 --> 00:24:18,887
Maintain course and speed.

464
00:24:18,929 --> 00:24:19,897
Red Alert.

465
00:24:19,931 --> 00:24:21,834
Aye, sir.

466
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:23,999
Here they come.

467
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:26,239
They'll pass us in five seconds.

468
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,544
On screen.

469
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:29,577
Track them.

470
00:24:29,621 --> 00:24:32,719
They're continuing
on their original heading.

471
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,562
No indication that they saw us.

472
00:24:35,602 --> 00:24:36,592
Wait a minute.

473
00:24:36,637 --> 00:24:38,334
They're changing course.

474
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:39,606
Heading this way.

475
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,171
They must have seen us.

476
00:24:41,249 --> 00:24:42,912
They're powering
their weapon systems.

477
00:24:42,953 --> 00:24:45,424
Prepare to de-cloak,
lock phasers on the lead ship...

478
00:24:45,459 --> 00:24:47,053
No! We may not have
been detected.

479
00:24:47,096 --> 00:24:48,121
Explain.

480
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:51,003
A cloaked ship radiates
a slight subspace variance

481
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,064
at warp speeds.

482
00:24:52,108 --> 00:24:53,509
I never heard that.

483
00:24:53,545 --> 00:24:56,039
It's not something
we've been eager to reveal.

484
00:24:56,085 --> 00:24:58,022
I suggest dropping out of warp.

485
00:24:58,055 --> 00:25:00,151
That will eliminate
the variance.

486
00:25:00,194 --> 00:25:03,635
When they reach our position,
they'll find nothing.

487
00:25:05,474 --> 00:25:06,568
Do it.

488
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:07,737
All stop.

489
00:25:15,965 --> 00:25:17,696
Commander,
they're sweeping the area

490
00:25:17,736 --> 00:25:19,536
with some kind
of an anti-proton scan

491
00:25:19,574 --> 00:25:21,977
and they're being
very thorough about it.

492
00:25:22,013 --> 00:25:24,348
Will an anti-proton scan
penetrate the cloak?

493
00:25:24,385 --> 00:25:26,014
That's a good question.

494
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:29,391
I'm not sure.

495
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:31,726
They're getting closer.

496
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:33,500
Commander.

497
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:35,238
The <i>Defiant's</i> power signature

498
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:37,545
is unusually high
for a ship this size.

499
00:25:37,584 --> 00:25:40,352
The cloaking device
may not be masking everything.

500
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:45,061
Cut main power.

501
00:25:55,827 --> 00:25:57,296
The other one
has broken off its search.

502
00:25:57,331 --> 00:25:58,299
It's headed this way.

503
00:25:58,334 --> 00:26:00,863
Stand by weapons and shields.

504
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,417
They've gone into warp...

505
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:23,187
and resumed
their original course.

506
00:26:24,663 --> 00:26:26,223
The first thing to go right

507
00:26:26,267 --> 00:26:28,431
in the Gamma Quadrant
in a long time.

508
00:26:28,473 --> 00:26:30,967
Let's hope it's not the last.

509
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:45,312
Ship's Log, Stardate 48212.4.

510
00:26:45,346 --> 00:26:47,340
We have arrived
at the Karemma home world

511
00:26:47,418 --> 00:26:50,152
and opened talks with one
of Quark's business partners

512
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,891
in an effort to contact
the Founders of the Dominion.

513
00:26:52,931 --> 00:26:54,731
The Grand Nagus himself

514
00:26:54,769 --> 00:26:58,232
has sent me as an emissary
on his behalf.

515
00:26:58,277 --> 00:26:59,940
If you aid us in our mission

516
00:26:59,981 --> 00:27:02,418
I'm authorized
to increase our purchase

517
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:06,259
of tulaberry wine
to the Karemma by three percent.

518
00:27:06,297 --> 00:27:10,033
Hmm, looks like
a polyduranium alloy blend.

519
00:27:10,072 --> 00:27:13,945
Interesting, but the metal
has no real value.

520
00:27:13,981 --> 00:27:16,452
A three percent
increase is negligible.

521
00:27:16,488 --> 00:27:20,692
I have considerable leeway
to bargain in this circumstance.

522
00:27:20,731 --> 00:27:21,790
Name your terms.

523
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:24,031
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

524
00:27:24,072 --> 00:27:26,738
The terms are not the issue.

525
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:28,146
I cannot help you
locate the Founders

526
00:27:28,182 --> 00:27:29,742
because I do not know
who they are

527
00:27:29,786 --> 00:27:32,189
or if they even exist.

528
00:27:32,225 --> 00:27:33,193
Nothing.

529
00:27:33,227 --> 00:27:36,166
Ah, here's something
interesting.

530
00:27:36,201 --> 00:27:37,232
Appears to be
diamide-laced beritium.

531
00:27:37,233 --> 00:27:38,827
Appears to be
diamide-laced beritium.

532
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,841
I'll give you 52 diraks for it.

533
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:41,843
Done.

534
00:27:41,877 --> 00:27:42,845
Quark.

535
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,577
I mean, one bargain
at a time, Ornithar.

536
00:27:44,617 --> 00:27:46,679
We were talking
about the Founders.

537
00:27:46,722 --> 00:27:48,522
There is nothing further to say.

538
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,756
If the Founders exist

539
00:27:49,796 --> 00:27:52,063
they clearly do not wish
to be contacted

540
00:27:52,102 --> 00:27:53,902
and that is good enough for me.

541
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:56,571
Who's your contact
in the Dominion

542
00:27:56,612 --> 00:27:59,779
regarding administration,
trade, defense?

543
00:27:59,854 --> 00:28:01,414
Our only contact
with the Dominion

544
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:02,722
has been through the Vorta.

545
00:28:02,794 --> 00:28:04,731
I have no idea
who they report to.

546
00:28:04,832 --> 00:28:08,398
All I know is that the Vorta say
to do something and you do it.

547
00:28:08,441 --> 00:28:09,842
Why?

548
00:28:09,878 --> 00:28:13,843
Because if you do not, they
will send in the Jem'Hadar...

549
00:28:13,887 --> 00:28:15,151
and then you die.

550
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,127
Will you put us in contact
with the Vorta?

551
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:19,531
Commander, we do only
as we are told, nothing more.

552
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:23,406
And so far, we have not been
told to help you in any way.

553
00:28:23,443 --> 00:28:25,710
You haven't been told not to,
either.

554
00:28:25,749 --> 00:28:28,722
No, but I prefer to err
on the side of caution.

555
00:28:28,756 --> 00:28:30,784
In this case, being cautious
will cost you

556
00:28:30,861 --> 00:28:32,057
a substantial profit.

557
00:28:32,098 --> 00:28:33,533
The Ferengi will cease

558
00:28:33,568 --> 00:28:36,062
purchasing tulaberry
wine immediately.

559
00:28:36,107 --> 00:28:37,907
If you lost such
a valuable contract

560
00:28:37,945 --> 00:28:40,577
with the Alpha Quadrant,
it might displease the Vorta.

561
00:28:40,617 --> 00:28:43,613
They may even send the Jem'Hadar
to find out what happened.

562
00:28:45,362 --> 00:28:48,859
I will need to access one
of our computers on the surface.

563
00:28:55,754 --> 00:28:57,588
This is the Callinon system.

564
00:28:57,625 --> 00:28:59,322
The Dominion maintains

565
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:01,961
an unmanned subspace relay
on the seventh planet.

566
00:29:02,002 --> 00:29:03,528
We have been told by the Vorta

567
00:29:03,573 --> 00:29:05,338
to direct
all communications there.

568
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:09,683
Where the messages are sent
after that is not our concern.

569
00:29:09,721 --> 00:29:12,717
What is that?

570
00:29:12,761 --> 00:29:15,825
It is the Omarion Nebula.

571
00:29:15,869 --> 00:29:21,109
The Omarion Nebula...

572
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:27,628
If there is nothing else,
I would like to leave now.

573
00:29:27,664 --> 00:29:28,723
Of course.

574
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,365
Uh, Commander, I believe

575
00:29:31,407 --> 00:29:33,036
I fulfilled my role
in this mission

576
00:29:33,077 --> 00:29:34,136
so if you don't mind...

577
00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:36,047
You want to stay behind?

578
00:29:36,084 --> 00:29:37,987
That was our agreement.

579
00:29:38,022 --> 00:29:38,990
How can you be sure

580
00:29:39,024 --> 00:29:40,653
he won't turn you
over to the Dominion

581
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:41,663
as soon as we leave?

582
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:43,258
He may serve the Dominion

583
00:29:43,301 --> 00:29:46,331
but I'm the one lining
his pockets with latinum.

584
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:47,867
I'll book passage

585
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:51,649
on the next ship going
through the wormhole

586
00:29:51,688 --> 00:29:55,026
and, uh, I'll make a profit
in the process.

587
00:29:55,063 --> 00:29:56,362
All right, Quark.

588
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,336
Good luck.

589
00:29:58,371 --> 00:30:00,239
Same to you, Commander.

590
00:30:03,349 --> 00:30:04,943
Lay in a course
for the Callinon system.

591
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:06,250
Aye, sir.

592
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,609
Come in.

593
00:30:21,527 --> 00:30:22,791
Did I wake you?

594
00:30:22,829 --> 00:30:25,768
Not quite.

595
00:30:25,804 --> 00:30:27,741
What can I do for you, Major?

596
00:30:27,774 --> 00:30:29,539
It's about Odo.

597
00:30:30,949 --> 00:30:32,179
You're worried about him.

598
00:30:32,219 --> 00:30:33,984
Is it that obvious?

599
00:30:34,023 --> 00:30:36,494
No, I'm worried about him, too.

600
00:30:36,529 --> 00:30:40,665
But, at the moment, I don't know
what to do about it.

601
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:43,006
Can I speak freely?

602
00:30:44,448 --> 00:30:46,851
What the hell is wrong
with Starfleet?!

603
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:48,288
How could they do this to him?

604
00:30:48,324 --> 00:30:50,158
This has been a long time
coming, Major.

605
00:30:50,195 --> 00:30:52,530
Starfleet has never been
happy with the Constable.

606
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:54,367
They've been pressing me
to replace him

607
00:30:54,405 --> 00:30:55,499
for the last two years.

608
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:57,978
Because he worked
for the Cardassians.

609
00:30:58,014 --> 00:30:59,176
No, it goes deeper than that.

610
00:30:59,216 --> 00:31:01,312
Odo is not what you'd call
a team player.

611
00:31:01,355 --> 00:31:02,654
Why? Because sometimes he

612
00:31:02,691 --> 00:31:04,685
doesn't go through
the proper channels?

613
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,131
Well, that's a start.

614
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:07,568
You know Odo.

615
00:31:07,603 --> 00:31:09,197
He enjoys thumbing his nose
at authority.

616
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,304
He files reports
when he feels like it.

617
00:31:12,348 --> 00:31:14,717
His respect for the chain
of command is minimal.

618
00:31:14,754 --> 00:31:15,984
He gets the job done.

619
00:31:16,024 --> 00:31:18,359
Starfleet likes team players.

620
00:31:18,396 --> 00:31:21,233
Starfleet likes
the chain of command

621
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:23,069
and, frankly, so do I.

622
00:31:23,107 --> 00:31:25,203
So you agree
with their decision?

623
00:31:25,246 --> 00:31:27,011
No, but I understand it.

624
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:29,021
And when this mission is over,
you're just going to let him go?

625
00:31:29,055 --> 00:31:31,288
Look, Major, I want him
to stay as much as you do

626
00:31:31,327 --> 00:31:32,591
but he has to want to stay.

627
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:34,327
Bridge to Commander Sisko.

628
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:36,861
We've reached
the Callinon system.

629
00:31:36,907 --> 00:31:38,604
On my way.

630
00:31:44,057 --> 00:31:46,028
Ship's Log, supplemental.

631
00:31:46,062 --> 00:31:47,224
The <i>Defiant</i> has cloaked

632
00:31:47,265 --> 00:31:50,033
and assumed standard orbit
around Callinon VII.

633
00:31:50,071 --> 00:31:51,506
I plan to send Dax and O'Brien

634
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:53,842
down to survey the relay station
on the surface.

635
00:31:53,881 --> 00:31:55,852
According to our sensor sweeps

636
00:31:55,885 --> 00:31:57,753
it looks like Ornithar
was telling the truth

637
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,693
when he said the relay
station was unmanned.

638
00:31:59,728 --> 00:32:03,191
It also appears there are very
few security measures in place.

639
00:32:03,237 --> 00:32:04,331
Nothing fancy.

640
00:32:04,372 --> 00:32:06,103
Get in, find what we
need and get out.

641
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,112
Understood.

642
00:32:07,146 --> 00:32:08,877
On your way.

643
00:32:08,917 --> 00:32:12,289
The transporter will need
six seconds to beam them down.

644
00:32:12,325 --> 00:32:15,321
I want to de-cloak
for exactly six seconds.

645
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:16,334
Dax to Bridge.

646
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:17,837
We're ready, Benjamin.

647
00:32:17,871 --> 00:32:18,965
All right.

648
00:32:19,008 --> 00:32:20,979
Disengage cloak.

649
00:32:21,013 --> 00:32:22,209
Energize.

650
00:32:24,955 --> 00:32:26,481
They're on the surface.

651
00:32:26,525 --> 00:32:28,792
Were we scanned
during transport?

652
00:32:28,832 --> 00:32:29,960
I don't think so.

653
00:32:30,001 --> 00:32:31,300
Dax to <i>Defiant.</i>

654
00:32:31,337 --> 00:32:32,465
Go ahead, Dax.

655
00:32:32,507 --> 00:32:35,948
We're in what seems to be
the central computer room.

656
00:32:35,982 --> 00:32:38,648
The user interface
is a little unusual

657
00:32:38,688 --> 00:32:40,716
but I think we can access it.

658
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,389
Keep us posted.

659
00:32:44,569 --> 00:32:46,699
I'm into the main directory.

660
00:32:46,741 --> 00:32:48,210
That was fast.

661
00:32:48,311 --> 00:32:50,214
Yes, it was.

662
00:32:50,249 --> 00:32:52,152
A bit too fast, if you ask me.

663
00:32:52,187 --> 00:32:53,850
Any indication
that we've tripped

664
00:32:53,892 --> 00:32:55,452
some kind of
security protocol?

665
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:58,696
No, I still have
access to everything.

666
00:32:58,736 --> 00:33:01,265
Then let's get the information
and get out of here.

667
00:33:01,309 --> 00:33:02,835
That's fine with me.

668
00:33:09,295 --> 00:33:11,357
I've should have taken
Quark up on his offer

669
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,425
for a new replicator.

670
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,438
Sir?

671
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,531
Nothing.

672
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,375
Let's make good use
of this time, Major.

673
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:18,075
Begin running a level-3
diagnostic...

674
00:33:18,116 --> 00:33:19,084
Dax to <i>Defiant.</i>

675
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:20,987
I think we have something,
Benjamin.

676
00:33:21,023 --> 00:33:23,187
We've accessed
a communications log

677
00:33:23,229 --> 00:33:24,823
of outgoing transmissions.

678
00:33:24,866 --> 00:33:26,233
From the way I read this, sir

679
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:28,466
it looks like 80%
of all outgoing traffic

680
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:29,977
is sent to one location.

681
00:33:30,011 --> 00:33:34,044
It's my guess it's either
another relay station

682
00:33:34,088 --> 00:33:35,113
or a command center.

683
00:33:35,157 --> 00:33:36,820
Do you have the coordinates?

684
00:33:36,861 --> 00:33:38,957
I'm sending them to you now.

685
00:33:41,705 --> 00:33:43,505
We've lost contact with them.

686
00:33:43,544 --> 00:33:44,911
Get them out of there!

687
00:33:44,947 --> 00:33:46,006
I can't.

688
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,953
Some kind of shield has
appeared around the outpost.

689
00:33:47,987 --> 00:33:48,955
I can't get through it.

690
00:33:52,933 --> 00:33:54,801
We're picking up three
Jem'Hadar ships, Commander

691
00:33:54,837 --> 00:33:55,827
heading this way.

692
00:33:55,873 --> 00:33:57,502
Can we punch
through the security shield

693
00:33:57,544 --> 00:33:59,309
with our phasers
before the ships get here?

694
00:33:59,348 --> 00:34:00,316
I'm not sure.

695
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,785
I've never seen
this kind of field before.

696
00:34:01,821 --> 00:34:04,190
In order to use the phasers,
we will have to de-cloak.

697
00:34:04,227 --> 00:34:06,255
That means, we'll be seen
by the Jem'Hadar.

698
00:34:06,332 --> 00:34:07,699
Well, we've got to do something.

699
00:34:07,735 --> 00:34:09,068
We can't just leave them there.

700
00:34:09,105 --> 00:34:10,973
That's exactly
what we should do, Doctor.

701
00:34:11,009 --> 00:34:11,977
Leave them.

702
00:34:12,012 --> 00:34:13,983
We came here to locate
the Founders.

703
00:34:14,017 --> 00:34:16,284
Not to fight the Jem'Hadar

704
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:18,120
over two expendable
crew members.

705
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,287
No one is expendable.

706
00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:20,798
The Jem'Hadar have
entered the system.

707
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:22,736
They'll be in orbit
in 30 seconds.

708
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:33,774
Prepare to leave orbit, Major.

709
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:34,874
Commander...

710
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:36,276
As you were, Doctor.

711
00:34:36,313 --> 00:34:40,015
Lay in a course
to the coordinates Dax sent us.

712
00:34:42,728 --> 00:34:44,493
Course laid in.

713
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:47,528
Warp 7. Engage.

714
00:35:03,043 --> 00:35:07,008
What do you think will happen
to Dax and O'Brien?

715
00:35:07,053 --> 00:35:10,026
They'll probably be held
for interrogation.

716
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,862
If I know Dax,
she'll use the opportunity

717
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,998
to try to contact the Founders,
and I intend to do the same.

718
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:19,447
Sisko to Odo.
Report to the Bridge, Constable.

719
00:35:19,482 --> 00:35:21,919
I want to discuss the security
arrangements for our...

720
00:35:21,956 --> 00:35:24,427
I'm presently indisposed,
Commander.

721
00:35:24,461 --> 00:35:26,523
Please find someone else
for the job.

722
00:35:26,566 --> 00:35:28,195
That doesn't sound like Odo.

723
00:35:28,236 --> 00:35:29,398
No, it doesn't.

724
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,741
I'd better have a talk with him.

725
00:35:31,778 --> 00:35:33,077
Uh, let me, sir.

726
00:35:33,115 --> 00:35:35,586
I think he'll listen to me.

727
00:35:35,621 --> 00:35:39,084
Three Jem'Hadar ships
have just entered sensor range.

728
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,659
Bearing 037 mark 215.

729
00:35:41,702 --> 00:35:43,433
Is there any sign
they've detected us?

730
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,499
Negative.

731
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:46,706
Bring us out of warp
and then cut main power.

732
00:35:46,748 --> 00:35:48,513
We'll wait here until they pass.

733
00:35:58,543 --> 00:36:01,175
Odo, it's time we had a talk.

734
00:36:01,215 --> 00:36:05,715
I'm not going to the Bridge,
so you can save your breath.

735
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,462
And I'd appreciate being
left alone right now.

736
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:13,102
Well, you tried being alone
and it hasn't done any good.

737
00:36:13,144 --> 00:36:17,051
So maybe it's time to stop
brooding and start talking.

738
00:36:18,491 --> 00:36:20,621
Are you the ship's counselor
now?

739
00:36:20,663 --> 00:36:24,468
No... I'm your friend.

740
00:36:24,505 --> 00:36:26,442
You know, the one
who comes to you

741
00:36:26,477 --> 00:36:27,707
when she needs help.

742
00:36:30,285 --> 00:36:33,383
I'm just trying
to return the favor.

743
00:36:34,429 --> 00:36:36,332
Well, you can return the favor

744
00:36:36,367 --> 00:36:39,272
by giving me a shuttlecraft
and letting me go.

745
00:36:39,307 --> 00:36:41,301
Go? Go where?

746
00:36:41,346 --> 00:36:43,715
We're in the heart
of the Dominion.

747
00:36:43,751 --> 00:36:46,656
Where the hell do you think
you're gonna go?

748
00:36:47,727 --> 00:36:49,925
The Omarion Nebula.

749
00:36:52,605 --> 00:36:54,074
Why?

750
00:36:54,142 --> 00:36:56,774
I'm not sure why.

751
00:36:56,815 --> 00:37:00,016
I just know I have to,
that's all.

752
00:37:00,057 --> 00:37:04,693
Y-You... you're going to have
to do a lot better than that.

753
00:37:07,074 --> 00:37:09,774
Odo...

754
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:11,009
talk to me.

755
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:13,716
Tell me what's going on.

756
00:37:18,568 --> 00:37:21,735
Ever since we've come
into the Gamma Quadrant...

757
00:37:21,775 --> 00:37:26,685
I've had this feeling...
of being drawn somewhere

758
00:37:26,721 --> 00:37:33,135
pulled by some instinct
to a specific place...

759
00:37:34,806 --> 00:37:37,141
the Omarion Nebula.

760
00:37:38,282 --> 00:37:39,512
Why there?

761
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,351
I don't know.

762
00:37:44,797 --> 00:37:46,130
All right.

763
00:37:47,637 --> 00:37:49,129
Once we've contacted
the Founders

764
00:37:49,207 --> 00:37:50,471
I'm sure Commander Sisko...

765
00:37:50,511 --> 00:37:52,037
No!

766
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:55,317
Not after we've contacted
the Founders... now!

767
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,882
I have to leave now!

768
00:37:56,926 --> 00:37:59,694
Look, I understand
this is important to you

769
00:37:59,733 --> 00:38:01,362
but we have a mission to...

770
00:38:04,878 --> 00:38:06,906
Direct hit on the port nacelle!

771
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:09,353
How did they see through
the cloaking device?

772
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,121
They might have analyzed
the sensor information

773
00:38:11,194 --> 00:38:12,686
on the anti-proton scan

774
00:38:12,731 --> 00:38:14,496
and found a way
to penetrate the cloak.

775
00:38:15,704 --> 00:38:17,766
We'll have to save
the speculation for later.

776
00:38:17,809 --> 00:38:21,580
Disengage the cloak, raise the
shields and fire on my command!

777
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:39,188
Communications
and long-range sensors are out!

778
00:38:39,227 --> 00:38:40,992
What's the status
of the warp drive?

779
00:38:41,032 --> 00:38:42,832
The starboard power coupling
is destroyed!

780
00:38:42,869 --> 00:38:45,306
I'm trying
to reroute main power!

781
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:53,090
He's gone!

782
00:38:53,128 --> 00:38:54,256
I'll take the helm!

783
00:38:55,935 --> 00:38:57,598
Locking onto the lead ship!

784
00:38:57,638 --> 00:38:58,937
- Ready?
- Ready!

785
00:38:58,975 --> 00:38:59,965
Fire!

786
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:08,662
The other two are moving
out of phaser range.

787
00:39:08,699 --> 00:39:11,501
They're coming back
for another pass.

788
00:39:11,539 --> 00:39:14,137
They're moving
a little slower now.

789
00:39:14,178 --> 00:39:16,206
They'll be
more cautious this time.

790
00:39:16,316 --> 00:39:18,583
Doctor, use
evasive pattern delta-5.

791
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:21,994
We need to keep them off balance
until we get warp power back.

792
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,124
Aye, sir.

793
00:39:27,644 --> 00:39:29,478
Are you all right?

794
00:39:29,515 --> 00:39:30,711
Just a few bruises.

795
00:39:30,751 --> 00:39:32,448
Kira to Bridge.

796
00:39:32,489 --> 00:39:34,426
Kira to Bridge!

797
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,058
We have to get up there.

798
00:39:38,503 --> 00:39:40,736
T'Rul, where's my warp power?

799
00:39:40,775 --> 00:39:43,441
I can't get the phase inducers
to align

800
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:44,449
with the ODN matrixes!

801
00:39:44,484 --> 00:39:46,478
Commander, three more
Jem'Hadar warships

802
00:39:46,522 --> 00:39:48,014
approaching off the port bow!

803
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,429
Full impulse!
Get us out of here!

804
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:53,563
We've lost main power.

805
00:39:53,606 --> 00:39:55,736
We've got to get to a shuttle.

806
00:39:55,777 --> 00:39:58,306
Our duty is to get to the Bridge
and help defend the ship.

807
00:39:58,417 --> 00:40:01,584
If main power is out,
then the shields are out, Kira.

808
00:40:01,626 --> 00:40:03,095
The ship is defenseless!

809
00:40:15,124 --> 00:40:17,027
Main power is off-line!

810
00:40:17,062 --> 00:40:19,329
The shields have collapsed!

811
00:40:19,367 --> 00:40:21,304
I've lost helm control.

812
00:40:21,339 --> 00:40:23,640
Inertial dampers failing.

813
00:40:23,678 --> 00:40:24,977
Ready escape pods.

814
00:40:25,014 --> 00:40:26,985
Prepare to abandon ship.

815
00:41:26,261 --> 00:41:27,924
Where am I?

816
00:41:29,603 --> 00:41:32,074
You're in a shuttlecraft.

817
00:41:32,108 --> 00:41:33,543
You were wounded.

818
00:41:33,579 --> 00:41:34,346
Try not to move around.

819
00:41:42,198 --> 00:41:44,328
Odo, what happened?

820
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:46,398
We were under attack.

821
00:41:48,145 --> 00:41:49,876
The ship was boarded.

822
00:41:49,917 --> 00:41:52,446
You were wounded in the attack.

823
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:55,327
I managed to get us
to the shuttlecraft

824
00:41:55,363 --> 00:41:58,097
but I don't know
much more than that.

825
00:41:58,136 --> 00:42:03,046
The last time I saw the <i>Defiant,</i>
she was dead in space

826
00:42:03,081 --> 00:42:06,487
and surrounded
by Jem'Hadar ships.

827
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:08,391
Sisko? Bashir?

828
00:42:10,533 --> 00:42:12,025
I don't know.

829
00:42:23,162 --> 00:42:24,597
Where are we?

830
00:42:24,634 --> 00:42:29,236
We're approaching
the Omarion Nebula.

831
00:42:29,278 --> 00:42:31,442
You should have taken us
back to the wormhole.

832
00:42:32,586 --> 00:42:34,523
You didn't object at the time.

833
00:42:34,557 --> 00:42:36,425
I was unconscious.

834
00:42:42,275 --> 00:42:43,608
You found anything?

835
00:42:49,894 --> 00:42:52,696
That's a Class-M planet.

836
00:42:52,734 --> 00:42:53,998
No star system.

837
00:42:54,037 --> 00:42:55,666
A rogue planet?

838
00:42:55,708 --> 00:42:57,736
Yes.

839
00:44:21,045 --> 00:44:22,810
Welcome home.
