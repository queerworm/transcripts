1
00:00:02,197 --> 00:00:06,299
Commander's Log,
Stardate 48959.1.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,177
It is with mixed emotions
that I record this

3
00:00:09,281 --> 00:00:11,411
my final Commander's Log.

4
00:00:11,452 --> 00:00:13,081
The last three years
have been

5
00:00:13,123 --> 00:00:15,687
the most demanding
and rewarding of my career.

6
00:00:15,729 --> 00:00:18,098
I can only hope
that the future will hold

7
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:19,798
even greater challenges.

8
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:21,468
Dad, there's something
I've been wanting

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,809
to say to you for a long time.

10
00:00:22,846 --> 00:00:25,375
And now that I
finally have the chance

11
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,618
I'm going to make it
short and simple.

12
00:00:32,937 --> 00:00:34,236
Congratulations...

13
00:00:34,274 --> 00:00:36,438
Captain Sisko.

14
00:00:41,224 --> 00:00:42,989
Well, now that you have
another pip on your collar

15
00:00:43,028 --> 00:00:45,261
does that mean I can't disagree
with you anymore?

16
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,270
No, it just means
I'm never wrong.

17
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,867
Oh, we'll see about that.

18
00:00:49,911 --> 00:00:51,905
Curzon would have been
proud of you

19
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,476
but not as proud as I am.

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,718
That means a lot to me, Dax.

21
00:00:58,499 --> 00:01:00,299
Though I don't fully understand

22
00:01:00,336 --> 00:01:02,934
this humanoid obsession
with rank and title

23
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,642
if anyone deserves
to be promoted, it's you.

24
00:01:05,682 --> 00:01:08,416
Thank you, Constable.

25
00:01:08,456 --> 00:01:11,258
Well, as someone who is obsessed
with rank and title

26
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:13,493
congratulations, Captain.

27
00:01:13,535 --> 00:01:15,198
That goes for me, too, Captain.

28
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:18,610
This calls for a toast.

29
00:01:18,647 --> 00:01:21,279
That better not be
from a replicator, Quark.

30
00:01:21,387 --> 00:01:23,187
Chateau Cleon, 2303.

31
00:01:23,224 --> 00:01:26,129
I already put it
on your account.

32
00:01:26,164 --> 00:01:27,895
Can I?

33
00:01:27,936 --> 00:01:29,873
I guess a sip won't hurt.

34
00:01:31,811 --> 00:01:34,044
Well...

35
00:01:34,084 --> 00:01:38,322
Here's to the newest
and best Captain in Starfleet

36
00:01:38,394 --> 00:01:40,923
and all I can say is,
it's about time.

37
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:42,266
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

38
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:43,293
Cheers.

39
00:01:44,242 --> 00:01:46,509
Ah, ah, that's, that's enough.

40
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:52,153
Thanks for coming, Ambassador.

41
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:57,198
Those pips look good
on you, Captain.

42
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,905
Though, to be honest

43
00:01:59,946 --> 00:02:02,247
I'm not really here
for the ceremony.

44
00:02:02,285 --> 00:02:04,085
I had that feeling.

45
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:05,820
What can I do for you?

46
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,458
Our intelligence
reports indicate

47
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,032
there's been a coup d'état
on the Tzenkethi homeworld.

48
00:02:12,075 --> 00:02:15,173
I doubt anyone is going
to miss the Autarch.

49
00:02:15,215 --> 00:02:16,514
I know I won't.

50
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:23,122
Unfortunately, it's too early
to tell who's in control

51
00:02:23,168 --> 00:02:25,571
but we don't want
to take any chances.

52
00:02:25,608 --> 00:02:27,545
We need to remind the Tzenkethi

53
00:02:27,578 --> 00:02:29,378
that the Federation
is committed to protecting

54
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,351
our colonies near their border.

55
00:02:31,388 --> 00:02:33,222
You want to show the flag.

56
00:02:33,258 --> 00:02:34,522
Exactly.

57
00:02:37,502 --> 00:02:40,738
The <i>Defiant</i> will leave in two
days on a week-long patrol.

58
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:42,577
I'll be coming along
as an observer.

59
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:46,013
I've heard a lot
about the <i>Defiant.</i>

60
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:48,527
I'm looking forward
to seeing her in operation.

61
00:02:48,562 --> 00:02:50,430
I don't think
you'll be disappointed.

62
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:51,833
She's a fine ship.

63
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,034
With a fine crew.

64
00:02:54,075 --> 00:02:55,669
Now what do you say
we get back to the party?

65
00:02:55,713 --> 00:02:56,841
Of course.

66
00:02:56,882 --> 00:03:00,323
For he's a jolly good fellow

67
00:03:00,357 --> 00:03:02,760
For he's
a jolly good fellow

68
00:03:02,797 --> 00:03:06,397
For he's a jolly good fellow

69
00:03:06,472 --> 00:03:09,240
Which nobody can deny.

70
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:10,247
Hip, hip...

71
00:03:10,281 --> 00:03:11,249
Hooray!

72
00:03:11,283 --> 00:03:12,251
- Hip, hip...
- Hooray!

73
00:03:12,286 --> 00:03:13,254
Hip, hip...

74
00:03:13,288 --> 00:03:14,450
Hooray!

75
00:03:34,873 --> 00:03:36,240
I want a complete overhaul

76
00:03:36,276 --> 00:03:38,041
of the deflector
shield generators

77
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:39,243
and targeting sensors.

78
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:42,280
Oh, yes... take on a full
complement of photon torpedoes.

79
00:03:42,324 --> 00:03:43,314
Don't worry, Captain.

80
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,125
If the Tzenkethi
try to start any trouble

81
00:03:45,165 --> 00:03:46,224
we'll be ready for them.

82
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,170
I don't doubt it, Chief.

83
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,597
Captain?

84
00:04:31,408 --> 00:04:33,311
Getting jumpy
in your old age, O'Brien.

85
00:06:35,213 --> 00:06:37,343
My son, the writer,
thinks I should say

86
00:06:37,418 --> 00:06:39,183
something profound
on this occasion.

87
00:06:39,222 --> 00:06:42,628
He even offered to write me
a brief statement.

88
00:06:42,663 --> 00:06:44,793
I told him
I'd take care of it myself.

89
00:06:44,835 --> 00:06:48,207
But as it turns out, the only
thing I can think of is:

90
00:06:48,244 --> 00:06:52,550
Begin Captain's Log,
Stardate 48960.9.

91
00:06:54,091 --> 00:06:55,583
So, have you told her yet?

92
00:06:56,596 --> 00:06:58,225
Told who?

93
00:06:58,268 --> 00:06:59,897
Captain Yates.

94
00:07:01,508 --> 00:07:02,738
About your promotion.

95
00:07:02,778 --> 00:07:04,270
Yeah, I barely had time

96
00:07:04,315 --> 00:07:06,343
to send my father
a transmission.

97
00:07:06,454 --> 00:07:09,758
In fact, I don't even know
where Kasidy is.

98
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:13,201
She's hauling a load
of duridium ore to Solais V.

99
00:07:13,237 --> 00:07:14,205
Oh.

100
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:17,041
You could probably
contact her on subspace.

101
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:19,073
I'd rather tell her in person.

102
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:21,950
When's she due back
on the station?

103
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:23,392
About a month.

104
00:07:23,461 --> 00:07:25,295
A month?!

105
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,802
Ah, there's nothing worse

106
00:07:26,836 --> 00:07:28,830
than a long-distance
relationship.

107
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,778
I wouldn't call it
a relationship, Dax.

108
00:07:30,812 --> 00:07:32,372
I've only taken her out once.

109
00:07:32,415 --> 00:07:34,909
Okay, twice.

110
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,426
I think the exact
figure is three times.

111
00:07:37,462 --> 00:07:39,695
She's quite
an interesting woman.

112
00:07:39,734 --> 00:07:42,137
She's very independent,
a little opinionated

113
00:07:42,173 --> 00:07:44,440
but she has
a nice sense of humor.

114
00:07:44,545 --> 00:07:45,775
And?

115
00:07:45,814 --> 00:07:49,050
And? What do you want me
to tell you, Dax?

116
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:50,353
That you miss her.

117
00:07:50,393 --> 00:07:53,127
That you can't wait to see her.

118
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:56,162
I don't know.
Anything.

119
00:07:56,207 --> 00:07:57,733
Kira, O'Brien, Bashir

120
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,648
they're all dying of curiosity,
and...

121
00:08:00,684 --> 00:08:02,278
well, I have to tell them
something.

122
00:08:02,321 --> 00:08:07,197
Fine. You tell them
when she gets back

123
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:10,365
I'm going to take her
to the holosuite

124
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,138
and we're going to watch

125
00:08:12,178 --> 00:08:15,151
the seventh game
of the 1964 World Series.

126
00:08:16,154 --> 00:08:18,216
You do like her.

127
00:08:19,796 --> 00:08:21,231
Captain on the Bridge.

128
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,235
Ambassador.

129
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:23,259
Captain.

130
00:08:25,242 --> 00:08:26,711
All stations, report.

131
00:08:26,746 --> 00:08:28,045
Helm ready.

132
00:08:28,082 --> 00:08:29,210
Weapons ready.

133
00:08:29,252 --> 00:08:31,348
Communications systems
standing by.

134
00:08:31,391 --> 00:08:33,624
Warp and impulse engines
are on line.

135
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:35,793
Seal the airlock,
release docking clamps.

136
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:38,500
Docking clamps released.

137
00:08:38,574 --> 00:08:40,134
Engage thrusters.

138
00:08:40,178 --> 00:08:42,776
Clearing the station.

139
00:08:42,818 --> 00:08:45,518
Lay in a course for the
Tzenkethi border, warp eight.

140
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,493
Aye, aye, Captain.

141
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,193
Engage.

142
00:09:24,752 --> 00:09:26,552
Hello?

143
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:28,583
Who's there?

144
00:10:02,141 --> 00:10:03,838
Julian!

145
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:05,405
You called me, Chief?

146
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:07,647
Why didn't you answer me?

147
00:10:07,688 --> 00:10:10,958
I had this spanner in my mouth.

148
00:10:12,099 --> 00:10:13,762
What are you doing here, anyway?

149
00:10:13,802 --> 00:10:16,000
I was connecting
my new diagnostic console

150
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,806
to the Medical Bay's power grid.

151
00:10:17,846 --> 00:10:19,543
Well, I could have
done that for you.

152
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,681
Oh, just putting my engineering
extension courses to work.

153
00:10:22,758 --> 00:10:24,956
Besides, I know
you have your hands full.

154
00:10:24,996 --> 00:10:27,662
Oh.
Where are you going now?

155
00:10:27,703 --> 00:10:29,606
I'm done.

156
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,134
Huh.

157
00:11:00,982 --> 00:11:03,249
Not bad for an extension course.

158
00:11:24,338 --> 00:11:26,468
You wanted to see me, sir?

159
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,604
Yes, Commander.

160
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:30,049
It's about Ambassador Krajensky.

161
00:11:31,154 --> 00:11:32,783
Please.

162
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:37,325
I know Starfleet doesn't intend
for this to be a combat mission.

163
00:11:37,369 --> 00:11:39,363
But just in case the Tzenkethi
have other ideas

164
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,902
I want make sure the Ambassador
is kept out of harm's way.

165
00:11:41,947 --> 00:11:43,075
Yes, sir.

166
00:11:43,117 --> 00:11:45,611
I'll see to it that,
if hostilities do occur

167
00:11:45,656 --> 00:11:48,059
the Ambassador is
escorted off the Bridge.

168
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,724
He won't like it.

169
00:11:49,766 --> 00:11:51,463
I won't let that bother me.

170
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:52,666
Very good, Commander.

171
00:11:52,706 --> 00:11:53,765
That will be all.

172
00:12:00,726 --> 00:12:01,854
Captain.

173
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:06,535
I just want to say that...

174
00:12:06,573 --> 00:12:08,737
I agree with
what Chief O'Brien said

175
00:12:08,778 --> 00:12:10,543
about your promotion.

176
00:12:10,582 --> 00:12:13,350
It's about time.

177
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:15,987
I appreciate the sentiment,
Commander

178
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:17,829
but it really
doesn't change anything.

179
00:12:17,934 --> 00:12:20,771
I have the assignment I want.
I have the crew that I want.

180
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:23,939
The rank doesn't
make much difference.

181
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:25,507
You'd be surprised.

182
00:12:25,551 --> 00:12:29,219
People don't enter Starfleet
to become Commanders

183
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,663
or Admirals, for that matter.

184
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,639
It's the Captain's chair
that everyone has their eye on.

185
00:12:34,673 --> 00:12:39,082
That's what I wanted
when I joined up, but...

186
00:12:39,117 --> 00:12:42,090
you don't get to be a Captain
wearing a gold uniform.

187
00:12:42,124 --> 00:12:45,222
You could always transfer
from security to command.

188
00:12:47,271 --> 00:12:49,869
Then who would protect
the Ambassador?

189
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:56,783
Dismissed, Mr. Eddington.

190
00:12:56,826 --> 00:12:58,763
Thank you, sir.

191
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:09,339
Captain's Log, Stardate 48962.5.

192
00:13:09,377 --> 00:13:11,541
We are 12 hours from the border.

193
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,051
I haven't been in this area

194
00:13:13,086 --> 00:13:15,523
since the last
Federation-Tzenkethi war.

195
00:13:15,558 --> 00:13:20,400
Being here brings back a lot
of memories, most of them bad.

196
00:13:21,807 --> 00:13:24,939
Captain, we're receiving
a priority one distress signal

197
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,711
from Barisa Prime, audio only.

198
00:13:26,752 --> 00:13:27,742
Put it through.

199
00:13:27,787 --> 00:13:30,521
Under heavy fire
from Tzenkethi warships.

200
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,053
I don't know how much longer
we can hold out.

201
00:13:32,098 --> 00:13:33,932
Can anyone hear me?

202
00:13:33,969 --> 00:13:35,666
This is...

203
00:13:37,244 --> 00:13:38,736
Constable?

204
00:13:38,781 --> 00:13:41,310
We've lost contact.

205
00:13:41,386 --> 00:13:42,878
Try to reestablish.

206
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:49,498
It's no use, Captain.

207
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,172
They're gone.

208
00:13:58,996 --> 00:14:01,092
Captain's Log, supplemental.

209
00:14:01,134 --> 00:14:03,037
We've been unable
to reestablish contact

210
00:14:03,072 --> 00:14:04,439
with Barisa Prime.

211
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:07,244
Therefore, I've no choice
but to assume

212
00:14:07,283 --> 00:14:09,686
we are at war
with the Tzenkethi.

213
00:14:09,721 --> 00:14:13,162
Lieutenant, set a course
for Barisa Prime, maximum warp.

214
00:14:13,197 --> 00:14:15,761
I want continual scans
for Tzenkethi ships.

215
00:14:15,802 --> 00:14:18,000
Constable, contact
Starfleet Command.

216
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:19,443
Let them know what happened.

217
00:14:19,478 --> 00:14:22,714
Major, what other starships
are in this sector?

218
00:14:22,752 --> 00:14:24,346
The closest one is the <i>Ulysses.</i>

219
00:14:24,424 --> 00:14:27,124
They're studying
protoplanetary masses

220
00:14:27,163 --> 00:14:28,462
in the Helaspont Nebula.

221
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:30,561
That puts them...

222
00:14:30,605 --> 00:14:33,099
20 hours away at maximum warp.

223
00:14:33,144 --> 00:14:36,242
Lieutenant, transmit a message
to Captain Entebe

224
00:14:36,285 --> 00:14:37,253
on the <i>Ulysses.</i>

225
00:14:37,287 --> 00:14:38,688
Captain, I'm having trouble

226
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:40,216
getting through
to Starfleet Command.

227
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:42,324
There seems to be
a power fluctuation

228
00:14:42,367 --> 00:14:44,736
in the communications system.

229
00:14:44,772 --> 00:14:46,503
I can't get a message out,
either.

230
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:48,034
The console is
functioning normally.

231
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,313
The problem must be in
the transceiver assembly.

232
00:14:50,352 --> 00:14:53,223
I need that system
back on line, Chief.

233
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,284
I'll get on it right away.

234
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:55,763
Lieutenant, I could
use some help.

235
00:14:55,798 --> 00:14:56,994
Major, take the helm.

236
00:14:57,035 --> 00:14:58,163
Yes, sir.

237
00:15:08,997 --> 00:15:12,529
What do you make
of this, Lieutenant?

238
00:15:12,572 --> 00:15:14,770
I've never seen
anything like it.

239
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:16,041
It's spreading

240
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,849
through the system
like some kind of parasite.

241
00:15:18,887 --> 00:15:20,356
It seems to be linked
to key points

242
00:15:20,391 --> 00:15:21,758
within the transceiver assembly.

243
00:15:21,794 --> 00:15:23,286
Better get it out of there.

244
00:15:27,441 --> 00:15:29,435
A force field.

245
00:15:29,546 --> 00:15:30,605
Come on.

246
00:15:30,648 --> 00:15:31,776
Where are we going?

247
00:15:31,818 --> 00:15:34,723
I want to check
the other command systems.

248
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:36,524
I have a bad feeling about this.

249
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:50,489
You say these things
are all over the ship?

250
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,794
They've attached themselves

251
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,598
to the command
and communication relays

252
00:15:53,637 --> 00:15:56,508
the internal sensors,
the transporter

253
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,774
the deflector shield grid...

254
00:15:58,816 --> 00:16:01,310
almost every critical system.

255
00:16:01,355 --> 00:16:04,385
Is there any way to get
past the force fields?

256
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:05,989
None that we've found yet.

257
00:16:06,034 --> 00:16:07,560
We're still working on it.

258
00:16:07,604 --> 00:16:08,937
Hmm.

259
00:16:10,478 --> 00:16:13,246
Well, I guess the question is

260
00:16:13,284 --> 00:16:15,187
how did they get aboard?

261
00:16:15,222 --> 00:16:19,061
Or should I say,
who placed them here?

262
00:16:19,098 --> 00:16:20,397
Well, I don't know who did it

263
00:16:20,435 --> 00:16:21,927
but I know it
definitely happened

264
00:16:21,972 --> 00:16:23,635
after we left the station.

265
00:16:23,675 --> 00:16:26,512
I ran a systems check
before our departure.

266
00:16:26,616 --> 00:16:27,915
They weren't there then.

267
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:32,987
Which means someone aboard
this ship is a saboteur.

268
00:16:33,031 --> 00:16:34,762
We've got 47 people on board.

269
00:16:34,802 --> 00:16:36,271
Theoretically, any one of them

270
00:16:36,306 --> 00:16:37,900
could have planted
those devices.

271
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:42,575
Chief?

272
00:16:44,425 --> 00:16:46,293
It's nothing, sir.

273
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,890
It's not even worth mentioning.

274
00:16:47,934 --> 00:16:50,337
It doesn't sound like you're
too sure about that.

275
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,572
Well, I did see someone

276
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:56,016
crawling about in one
of the Jefferies tubes

277
00:16:56,053 --> 00:16:57,043
the other day.

278
00:16:57,089 --> 00:16:58,148
Who?

279
00:16:59,963 --> 00:17:00,931
It was Julian.

280
00:17:00,965 --> 00:17:02,696
He was connecting

281
00:17:02,736 --> 00:17:05,037
a medical console
to the power grid.

282
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:09,313
Which is right next
to the communications relay.

283
00:17:09,352 --> 00:17:11,653
Are you accusing Julian
of sabotage?

284
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:15,996
No one's accusing anyone
of anything, I...

285
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:18,939
But I want to talk to Julian.

286
00:17:18,975 --> 00:17:20,376
Wait.

287
00:17:20,412 --> 00:17:22,508
I think I have a better idea.

288
00:17:24,922 --> 00:17:27,986
This crew has been
through a lot together.

289
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,937
In fact, I would trust any
one of you with my life.

290
00:17:31,973 --> 00:17:33,738
But after looking
at the evidence

291
00:17:33,777 --> 00:17:37,047
there's only one conclusion
I can draw:

292
00:17:37,085 --> 00:17:41,118
Someone on this ship
is guilty of sabotage.

293
00:17:44,235 --> 00:17:47,106
With your permission, Captain,
the Constable and I

294
00:17:47,142 --> 00:17:49,613
can begin questioning
the crew immediately.

295
00:17:49,648 --> 00:17:51,482
That won't be necessary.

296
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:52,647
Lieutenant?

297
00:17:52,689 --> 00:17:54,420
We found one of the devices

298
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,624
planted
in the warp plasma conduit

299
00:17:56,665 --> 00:18:00,504
which means whoever put it there
would have been exposed

300
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,480
to trace amounts
of tetryon particles.

301
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:07,251
And those particles would still
be detectable on the saboteur?

302
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,625
Yes, but not for much longer.

303
00:18:09,662 --> 00:18:11,359
They dissipate quickly.

304
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,528
So you're going to scan

305
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:15,098
all the members of the crew
for tetryon particles.

306
00:18:15,143 --> 00:18:16,840
Starting with the senior staff.

307
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,645
O'Brien and I already
scanned positive

308
00:18:18,684 --> 00:18:20,655
since we opened up
the warp core controls

309
00:18:20,689 --> 00:18:22,557
during our investigation.

310
00:18:22,593 --> 00:18:26,500
You realize, of course, that
if no one else tests positive...

311
00:18:26,537 --> 00:18:28,234
We'll be the prime suspects.

312
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,538
Yes, we know that.

313
00:18:30,914 --> 00:18:33,385
We might as well get started.

314
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,080
You're clean.

315
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:48,713
I'm glad to hear it.

316
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,091
Might as well do me next.

317
00:19:05,329 --> 00:19:07,527
You're okay, too.

318
00:19:10,876 --> 00:19:12,140
Julian.

319
00:19:13,315 --> 00:19:14,443
Hmm?

320
00:19:14,485 --> 00:19:15,749
Of course.

321
00:19:34,867 --> 00:19:36,097
Nothing.

322
00:19:36,136 --> 00:19:37,332
You sound relieved.

323
00:19:37,373 --> 00:19:38,740
Well, I am.

324
00:19:38,776 --> 00:19:41,111
After all, you were in that
conduit the other day.

325
00:19:41,148 --> 00:19:42,549
Ambassador, if you please?

326
00:19:42,585 --> 00:19:43,781
Certainly.

327
00:19:43,822 --> 00:19:45,018
I was never in any conduit.

328
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,425
Of course you were.

329
00:19:46,462 --> 00:19:47,556
I saw you there.

330
00:20:00,662 --> 00:20:03,362
It's a changeling.

331
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:17,284
We've cloaked.

332
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:19,290
Lieutenant,
bring us out of warp.

333
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,428
Full stop...

334
00:20:21,463 --> 00:20:22,431
now.

335
00:20:22,465 --> 00:20:24,196
Constable, Commander...

336
00:20:24,236 --> 00:20:25,796
deploy security
teams immediately.

337
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,868
I want that changeling found

338
00:20:27,912 --> 00:20:29,211
before he can do
any more damage.

339
00:20:29,248 --> 00:20:30,273
Yes, sir.

340
00:20:30,317 --> 00:20:31,616
Captain, the helm's
not responding.

341
00:20:31,654 --> 00:20:32,782
We're still at warp.

342
00:20:32,823 --> 00:20:34,657
I can't deactivate
the cloaking device.

343
00:20:34,694 --> 00:20:36,220
The weapons array is activated.

344
00:20:36,264 --> 00:20:38,896
The phaser banks are charging.

345
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:42,242
And we've got photon torpedoes
on line and ready to launch.

346
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:45,913
The ship's no longer
under our control.

347
00:20:53,305 --> 00:20:54,797
Our security teams
have gone over

348
00:20:54,842 --> 00:20:56,106
every centimeter of the ship

349
00:20:56,145 --> 00:20:57,876
checked every piece of cargo

350
00:20:57,917 --> 00:20:59,717
questioned every crew member.

351
00:20:59,754 --> 00:21:02,420
We still haven't been able
to find the changeling.

352
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,021
Is there any way
he could have been

353
00:21:04,064 --> 00:21:05,192
transported off the ship?

354
00:21:05,234 --> 00:21:06,202
At warp?

355
00:21:06,236 --> 00:21:07,796
It's unlikely, but...

356
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,372
with Dominion technology,
I suppose it's possible.

357
00:21:11,415 --> 00:21:13,078
He's still here.

358
00:21:17,764 --> 00:21:20,965
He won't leave until he's
completed his mission.

359
00:21:21,005 --> 00:21:22,269
Which is?

360
00:21:22,308 --> 00:21:26,808
It looks like the Dominion
is hoping to start a war

361
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,481
between the Federation
and the Tzenkethi.

362
00:21:28,523 --> 00:21:30,323
Well, if you ask me,
the Tzenkethi

363
00:21:30,361 --> 00:21:32,764
are doing a pretty good job
of that all by themselves.

364
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,859
Not necessarily.

365
00:21:33,903 --> 00:21:35,167
The transmission

366
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:38,008
we received from Barisa Prime
could have been faked

367
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,811
using that device
we found implanted

368
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,251
in the
communications relay.

369
00:21:41,287 --> 00:21:45,229
In fact, our entire
mission could have been

370
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:47,700
engineered by the Dominion.

371
00:21:47,736 --> 00:21:48,966
Think about it.

372
00:21:49,005 --> 00:21:53,004
We've been all over this ship
and we have not seen a trace

373
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:55,316
of the real
Ambassador Krajensky

374
00:21:55,354 --> 00:21:57,484
nor his remains.

375
00:21:57,526 --> 00:21:59,189
Which means, he was
probably replaced

376
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,494
before we left the station.

377
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:02,127
Maybe the real Ambassador

378
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,300
never came
to Deep Space 9 at all.

379
00:22:04,342 --> 00:22:06,279
So everything Ambassador
Krajensky told us

380
00:22:06,313 --> 00:22:07,407
could have been a lie...

381
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,976
the Tzenkethi coup d'état

382
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,184
increased tension
along the border

383
00:22:11,225 --> 00:22:12,524
the threat of an attack.

384
00:22:12,562 --> 00:22:16,333
And now, here we are, cloaked,
armed for battle

385
00:22:16,371 --> 00:22:18,569
and heading
into Tzenkethi space.

386
00:22:18,677 --> 00:22:22,174
If we can't stop this ship
before we cross the border

387
00:22:22,218 --> 00:22:25,282
we may wind up causing a war
rather than preventing one.

388
00:22:25,326 --> 00:22:28,060
Which is, no doubt
what my people are hoping for.

389
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:31,335
A war between the Tzenkethi
and the Federation

390
00:22:31,373 --> 00:22:33,367
would destabilize
the Alpha Quadrant

391
00:22:33,412 --> 00:22:36,078
making it that much easier
for the Dominion to move in.

392
00:22:36,118 --> 00:22:39,422
I wish the internal sensors
were on line.

393
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,866
It'd make it a lot easier
to track down the changeling.

394
00:22:42,901 --> 00:22:44,929
I'm not sure
the sensors would help.

395
00:22:44,973 --> 00:22:49,040
If you scan me while I'm a rock,
you'll detect a rock.

396
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:52,854
I may not be able to duplicate
a humanoid perfectly

397
00:22:52,892 --> 00:22:54,657
but I'm guessing he can.

398
00:22:54,763 --> 00:22:57,132
We scanned Krajensky
for tetryon particles.

399
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:58,158
He registered as human.

400
00:22:58,205 --> 00:22:59,195
Well then, right now

401
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,872
the changeling could be
anything...

402
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:04,249
or anyone on this ship.

403
00:23:04,286 --> 00:23:07,282
Then we have to narrow
his options.

404
00:23:07,327 --> 00:23:10,631
Confine all nonessential
personnel to their quarters

405
00:23:10,668 --> 00:23:12,297
and seal them in
with force fields.

406
00:23:12,339 --> 00:23:15,643
Doctor, I want you to review
all the tricorder readings.

407
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,842
See if you can find anything

408
00:23:16,883 --> 00:23:18,546
that will help us
find the changeling.

409
00:23:18,586 --> 00:23:19,953
And take some security with you.

410
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,963
From here on, no one
is to be left alone.

411
00:23:27,642 --> 00:23:31,310
We have seven hours
before we enter Tzenkethi space.

412
00:23:31,351 --> 00:23:33,686
I want that changeling
found before then.

413
00:23:33,723 --> 00:23:35,694
That won't be easy.

414
00:23:35,728 --> 00:23:37,824
Let's face it, no matter
how many precautions we take

415
00:23:37,866 --> 00:23:39,928
he could replace any one of us

416
00:23:39,971 --> 00:23:42,808
and we won't know it
until it's too late.

417
00:23:51,465 --> 00:23:53,162
Thank you for your cooperation.

418
00:23:53,203 --> 00:23:54,866
Hopefully,
this will be over soon

419
00:23:54,907 --> 00:23:57,174
and you'll be able
to return to duty.

420
00:24:01,222 --> 00:24:02,521
All right, let's go.

421
00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:22,270
This may take a while.

422
00:24:27,351 --> 00:24:30,153
Keep your phasers on stun
and stay calm.

423
00:24:30,191 --> 00:24:31,888
I don't want anyone
getting nervous

424
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:33,626
and shooting one
of us by mistake.

425
00:24:36,841 --> 00:24:39,335
You sure I can't interest
you in one of these?

426
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,542
I don't use them.

427
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,314
Besides, in the history
of my people

428
00:24:42,354 --> 00:24:44,222
no changeling has
ever harmed another.

429
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:46,287
I'd hate to be the first.

430
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,426
Apparently, that changeling
doesn't feel the same way.

431
00:24:48,469 --> 00:24:49,597
If we don't stop him

432
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:52,042
no one on board will escape
unharmed, including you.

433
00:24:52,077 --> 00:24:53,911
You may be right.

434
00:24:53,949 --> 00:24:57,822
But I've been a security officer
most of my humanoid existence

435
00:24:57,858 --> 00:25:00,831
and in all that time, I've
never found it necessary

436
00:25:00,865 --> 00:25:02,699
to fire a weapon or take a life.

437
00:25:02,736 --> 00:25:05,230
I don't intend to start now.

438
00:25:05,275 --> 00:25:06,437
This is O'Brien.

439
00:25:06,478 --> 00:25:09,076
I need a security team in
the Engine Room immediately.

440
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:16,966
It must have been
the changeling.

441
00:25:17,004 --> 00:25:19,909
I went down the hall to get
an interphasic compensator.

442
00:25:19,944 --> 00:25:21,436
I heard a noise,
and when I came back...

443
00:25:21,481 --> 00:25:22,471
She has a severe concussion.

444
00:25:22,517 --> 00:25:23,576
Give me a hand.

445
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,614
We've got to get her to
the Medical Bay immediately.

446
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:31,898
Stay here with the Chief.

447
00:25:34,312 --> 00:25:38,117
Damage control team,
report to the Engine Room.

448
00:25:38,154 --> 00:25:39,885
Aye, sir.

449
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:52,043
Dax is still unconscious.

450
00:25:52,088 --> 00:25:53,455
I've given her
cortical analeptics

451
00:25:53,491 --> 00:25:54,550
to stabilize her condition.

452
00:25:54,593 --> 00:25:56,187
She should be all
right in a day or two

453
00:25:56,231 --> 00:25:57,256
but until then...

454
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,237
Is there any way
to speed up the process?

455
00:25:59,272 --> 00:26:00,969
I could use a neural stimulator

456
00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:03,641
but that might cause
irreversible brain damage.

457
00:26:03,682 --> 00:26:05,049
I don't recommend it.

458
00:26:07,224 --> 00:26:09,252
Then Chief O'Brien
is going to have

459
00:26:09,296 --> 00:26:11,825
to regain control of the ship
without her.

460
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,671
I'm afraid so.

461
00:26:14,709 --> 00:26:16,144
I should get back to my patient.

462
00:26:21,592 --> 00:26:23,221
The changeling's very clever.

463
00:26:23,262 --> 00:26:26,201
Taking Dax out makes
O'Brien's job a lot harder.

464
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,109
One thing's for sure.

465
00:26:29,144 --> 00:26:32,676
We're not going to start a war
with the Tzenkethi.

466
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:37,321
If O'Brien can't regain control
before we cross the border

467
00:26:37,363 --> 00:26:41,738
I'll have no choice
but to destroy the <i>Defiant.</i>

468
00:26:51,162 --> 00:26:52,859
Our objective is simple.

469
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,803
Find the changeling
and stop him

470
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:56,935
before he can do
any more damage.

471
00:26:56,977 --> 00:26:59,414
We'll break
into two-person teams.

472
00:26:59,449 --> 00:27:03,185
Each team will be armed
with phaser rifles.

473
00:27:03,225 --> 00:27:04,598
Now, we've reconfigured
the rifles

474
00:27:04,731 --> 00:27:06,565
to fire
an expanding energy pulse.

475
00:27:06,603 --> 00:27:07,662
Phasers have been set

476
00:27:07,773 --> 00:27:10,439
low enough to prevent
damaging equipment

477
00:27:10,478 --> 00:27:13,110
but high enough
to affect the changeling.

478
00:27:13,152 --> 00:27:16,422
The changeling
could be hiding anywhere.

479
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,931
He could look like anything.

480
00:27:18,965 --> 00:27:21,334
So we're going to have
to systematically

481
00:27:21,372 --> 00:27:23,309
sweep the ship with phaser fire.

482
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:26,440
Every conduit, every corridor.

483
00:27:26,484 --> 00:27:29,856
If he's out there,
we'll find him.

484
00:27:29,892 --> 00:27:32,125
Any questions?

485
00:27:32,164 --> 00:27:34,533
What if the changeling's
not out there?

486
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,541
What if he's one of us?

487
00:27:36,575 --> 00:27:39,571
That's why everyone
will be in teams.

488
00:27:39,615 --> 00:27:42,213
Keep your partner in sight
at all times.

489
00:27:42,255 --> 00:27:43,884
And if we see anyone
without a partner?

490
00:27:43,925 --> 00:27:44,893
Escort them to the brig.

491
00:27:44,928 --> 00:27:47,297
We don't want
to take any chances.

492
00:27:48,336 --> 00:27:49,566
Let's go.

493
00:28:08,485 --> 00:28:09,954
All right, let's go.

494
00:28:12,093 --> 00:28:13,152
After you.

495
00:28:13,196 --> 00:28:14,927
Don't you trust me?

496
00:28:14,967 --> 00:28:17,268
No, I don't.

497
00:28:18,876 --> 00:28:21,405
I know exactly how you feel.

498
00:28:23,554 --> 00:28:24,887
Follow me.

499
00:28:48,446 --> 00:28:49,847
Don't you ever sweat?

500
00:28:50,886 --> 00:28:53,221
No, I don't.

501
00:28:54,695 --> 00:28:56,358
It's the modified phaser beam.

502
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,530
It's heating up the air.

503
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:00,735
Hmm.

504
00:29:00,777 --> 00:29:03,214
You know,
this would be a lot easier

505
00:29:03,249 --> 00:29:05,413
if we knew where he was hiding.

506
00:29:05,454 --> 00:29:06,855
Where would you be
if you were him?

507
00:29:08,428 --> 00:29:09,727
I wouldn't know.

508
00:29:09,764 --> 00:29:10,994
I'm not him.

509
00:29:13,774 --> 00:29:16,007
He is one of your people.

510
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,517
Now, can't you put yourself
in his position?

511
00:29:18,553 --> 00:29:21,082
Try to anticipate
his next move?

512
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:24,691
I've thought about it,
but the truth is

513
00:29:24,734 --> 00:29:29,040
I don't understand my people
all that well.

514
00:29:31,149 --> 00:29:32,618
That's too bad.

515
00:29:32,652 --> 00:29:35,284
Yes, it is.

516
00:29:35,326 --> 00:29:36,351
For all of us.

517
00:30:00,252 --> 00:30:01,346
Watch my back.

518
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:24,102
Over here.

519
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:26,578
On three.

520
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:27,584
One...

521
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:28,608
two...

522
00:30:39,647 --> 00:30:40,946
This is Sisko.

523
00:30:40,983 --> 00:30:43,820
The changeling is
in Jefferies tube 7-A

524
00:30:43,857 --> 00:30:45,190
heading to the lower deck.

525
00:30:45,227 --> 00:30:46,992
I'm in pursuit!

526
00:31:12,492 --> 00:31:14,189
The changeling...

527
00:31:14,229 --> 00:31:15,823
he's right over there.

528
00:31:18,673 --> 00:31:20,074
Put your phaser down.

529
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,078
It's me, Kira.

530
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:22,275
We were on our way

531
00:31:22,316 --> 00:31:24,081
to meet you and we got
separated for a second.

532
00:31:24,186 --> 00:31:25,655
The next thing I know,
he opens fire.

533
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,091
You can't fool me.

534
00:31:27,193 --> 00:31:28,423
You're the changeling!

535
00:31:28,463 --> 00:31:31,733
I saw you come out of that hatch
and go around the corner!

536
00:31:31,772 --> 00:31:33,207
I didn't see anyone!

537
00:31:33,242 --> 00:31:34,438
What...

538
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:37,576
Maybe he morphed
into the ventilation system...

539
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:39,886
or maybe he didn't.

540
00:31:40,894 --> 00:31:42,694
For all we know,
you may be the changeling.

541
00:31:42,731 --> 00:31:44,759
Keep back!

542
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:47,240
Both of you, put
your weapons down now!

543
00:31:50,183 --> 00:31:52,654
I can't do that, Captain.

544
00:31:52,688 --> 00:31:53,884
You heard him!

545
00:32:01,476 --> 00:32:03,379
What happened?

546
00:32:03,414 --> 00:32:05,978
How long have
the two of you been apart?

547
00:32:07,391 --> 00:32:08,587
At least a minute.

548
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:11,224
Then we've got a problem.

549
00:32:11,266 --> 00:32:13,328
Any one of us could be
the changeling.

550
00:32:13,371 --> 00:32:16,834
You, Kira, Eddington, even me.

551
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,714
Not you.

552
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,049
What do you mean?

553
00:32:20,087 --> 00:32:22,251
You're bleeding.

554
00:32:24,364 --> 00:32:27,998
I cut my hand
when the changeling attacked me.

555
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:29,372
What are you getting at?

556
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:33,180
When blood leaves a humanoid
body, it's still blood.

557
00:32:33,286 --> 00:32:35,553
But when any part of me
separates

558
00:32:35,591 --> 00:32:36,559
from my body...

559
00:32:36,593 --> 00:32:38,962
It reverts back
to a gelatinous state.

560
00:32:43,677 --> 00:32:45,044
Sisko to Bashir.

561
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,914
This is Bashir.

562
00:32:46,952 --> 00:32:50,484
Doctor, meet us in the Mess Hall
immediately.

563
00:32:59,348 --> 00:33:00,942
This shouldn't take long.

564
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:22,130
Satisfied?

565
00:33:23,172 --> 00:33:24,972
So far.

566
00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:26,912
Who's next?

567
00:33:26,948 --> 00:33:28,508
I'll go.

568
00:33:51,506 --> 00:33:56,142
I'd say the Major is exactly
who she appears to be.

569
00:33:56,184 --> 00:33:58,348
Try not to look so surprised.

570
00:34:03,047 --> 00:34:04,984
There doesn't seem
to be any point

571
00:34:05,019 --> 00:34:07,490
in obtaining a sample
from the Constable.

572
00:34:07,525 --> 00:34:10,988
I guess that just leaves
the three of us.

573
00:34:11,033 --> 00:34:12,696
Let's get this over with.

574
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:44,441
You better come with us.

575
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,167
This is ridiculous.

576
00:34:55,206 --> 00:34:56,539
I'm not the changeling.

577
00:34:56,576 --> 00:34:58,068
If I were, don't you think

578
00:34:58,113 --> 00:35:00,243
I'd put up a little more
of a fight?

579
00:35:02,924 --> 00:35:04,895
Inside.

580
00:35:04,929 --> 00:35:06,364
You're making a mistake.

581
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:08,028
Do as he says!

582
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:13,445
Will someone please
get me out of here!

583
00:35:28,486 --> 00:35:30,423
Bridge to Captain Sisko.

584
00:35:30,456 --> 00:35:31,720
Sisko here.

585
00:35:31,826 --> 00:35:34,492
Sir, we're entering
Tzenkethi space.

586
00:35:51,407 --> 00:35:52,933
Any sign of Tzenkethi ships?

587
00:35:52,978 --> 00:35:55,108
Sensors aren't picking up
any warp signatures.

588
00:35:55,149 --> 00:35:56,448
We've altered course.

589
00:35:56,486 --> 00:35:59,892
Our new heading is 015 mark 47.

590
00:36:01,298 --> 00:36:02,494
We're headed directly

591
00:36:02,533 --> 00:36:05,062
for the Tzenkethi settlement
on M'kemas III.

592
00:36:05,107 --> 00:36:07,705
How long before we're in weapons
range of the settlement?

593
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:11,315
12 minutes.

594
00:36:18,472 --> 00:36:19,531
Computer.

595
00:36:19,574 --> 00:36:21,636
This is Captain Benjamin Sisko.

596
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,244
Initiate autodestruct sequence.

597
00:36:24,286 --> 00:36:28,091
Authorization:
Sisko-alpha-one-alpha.

598
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:31,124
Identity confirmed.

599
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:33,640
Additional authorization
required.

600
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:48,571
This is First Officer
Kira Nerys.

601
00:36:48,611 --> 00:36:53,487
Autodestruct authorization:
Kira-beta-two-beta.

602
00:36:53,523 --> 00:36:54,856
Identity confirmed.

603
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,193
Autodestruct sequence armed.

604
00:37:01,174 --> 00:37:04,637
Set the countdown
for ten minutes from my mark.

605
00:37:04,682 --> 00:37:09,388
Authorization:
Sisko-one-five destruct.

606
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,501
Mark.

607
00:37:16,545 --> 00:37:18,846
Sequence initiated.

608
00:37:18,883 --> 00:37:21,981
Autodestruct
in nine minutes, 55 seconds.

609
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:34,886
Sisko to O'Brien.

610
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:36,117
O'Brien here.

611
00:37:36,158 --> 00:37:39,154
I could use some good news
right now, Chief.

612
00:37:39,198 --> 00:37:40,690
How about this?

613
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,467
I think I may be able
to shut down

614
00:37:42,507 --> 00:37:44,067
the changeling's force fields

615
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:46,844
and gain access
to the sabotaged systems.

616
00:37:46,884 --> 00:37:49,151
The only problem is
we may lose

617
00:37:49,189 --> 00:37:50,715
our force fields, too.

618
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,289
Autodestruct in seven minutes.

619
00:37:53,332 --> 00:37:55,826
Just tell me
how long it will take.

620
00:37:55,872 --> 00:37:57,501
Well, I guess it'll have to be

621
00:37:57,543 --> 00:37:59,411
less than seven minutes,
won't it?

622
00:37:59,447 --> 00:38:00,973
That'd be my suggestion.

623
00:38:01,018 --> 00:38:02,248
Sisko out.

624
00:38:02,288 --> 00:38:03,882
Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax?

625
00:38:03,925 --> 00:38:04,893
Still unconscious.

626
00:38:04,927 --> 00:38:06,556
The changeling gave
her enough sedative

627
00:38:06,598 --> 00:38:08,626
to keep her under for days.

628
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,071
I've managed
to filter most of it

629
00:38:10,106 --> 00:38:11,632
out of her system,
but she'll be out

630
00:38:11,677 --> 00:38:12,667
for another few hours.

631
00:38:12,712 --> 00:38:13,680
I wish I could do more.

632
00:38:13,715 --> 00:38:16,084
You've done all you can
Doctor.

633
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,387
Now it's up to Chief O'Brien.

634
00:38:25,276 --> 00:38:27,747
Autodestruct in six minutes.

635
00:38:27,781 --> 00:38:30,948
All right, we're almost there.

636
00:38:31,056 --> 00:38:34,758
Now, look,
when we set this device off

637
00:38:34,798 --> 00:38:36,598
there's a possibility
we may lose

638
00:38:36,637 --> 00:38:38,801
the protective field
around the warp core.

639
00:38:38,842 --> 00:38:41,781
If that happens, this room's
going to heat up real fast.

640
00:38:41,815 --> 00:38:44,617
So give the warp core
a wide berth

641
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,490
or you'll get a dose
of radiation poisoning

642
00:38:46,527 --> 00:38:48,087
even Bashir can't cure.

643
00:38:52,909 --> 00:38:53,877
Where's the changeling?

644
00:38:53,911 --> 00:38:55,005
I lost him in the conduits.

645
00:38:55,047 --> 00:38:56,516
We haven't seen him.

646
00:39:00,126 --> 00:39:01,185
Wait!

647
00:39:01,228 --> 00:39:02,720
It's me, Odo.

648
00:39:04,135 --> 00:39:05,935
You don't say?

649
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:11,847
Chief, remember the last time

650
00:39:11,887 --> 00:39:15,088
we went kayaking
in the holosuite?

651
00:39:15,129 --> 00:39:17,123
You had lamb stew for lunch.

652
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:18,260
That's right.

653
00:39:18,303 --> 00:39:20,171
But you forgot to bring a fork.

654
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:22,372
Anyone could have gotten
that information.

655
00:39:22,413 --> 00:39:24,782
Autodestruct in five minutes.

656
00:39:24,818 --> 00:39:26,515
You'd better make a decision.

657
00:39:26,556 --> 00:39:28,116
We're running out of time.

658
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:32,432
Look, I've more important
things to do

659
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,941
than play
"choose the changeling."

660
00:39:34,976 --> 00:39:37,379
Keep the phaser on both of them.

661
00:39:45,735 --> 00:39:48,036
The shuttlebay doors are sealed.

662
00:39:48,074 --> 00:39:49,566
The evacuation pods
are locked down.

663
00:39:49,611 --> 00:39:50,773
We have no way out.

664
00:39:50,814 --> 00:39:52,944
Weapons are fully charged
and ready to fire.

665
00:39:52,985 --> 00:39:55,252
Tactical systems
are programming an attack run

666
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:57,661
on the Tzenkethi settlement.

667
00:40:03,277 --> 00:40:05,214
Chief, what are you doing?

668
00:40:05,249 --> 00:40:07,743
Autodestruct in four minutes.

669
00:40:07,788 --> 00:40:08,950
You'll see.

670
00:40:14,437 --> 00:40:15,531
Now!

671
00:40:18,012 --> 00:40:20,506
Warning: Warp core field breach.

672
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:22,648
Engine Room will be sealed
in ten seconds.

673
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,023
Evacuate immediately.

674
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,689
Shut down the main power grid!

675
00:40:29,273 --> 00:40:30,263
No!

676
00:40:32,848 --> 00:40:34,876
Engine room sealed.

677
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:45,842
Why are you protecting
these solids?

678
00:40:45,879 --> 00:40:47,941
You don't belong with them.

679
00:40:47,984 --> 00:40:49,214
You belong with us.

680
00:40:49,254 --> 00:40:51,623
Autodestruct in three minutes.

681
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,220
Let go.

682
00:40:53,264 --> 00:40:55,667
Don't you see?
You've lost.

683
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,765
It's too late
for you to help them

684
00:40:57,808 --> 00:41:00,177
but it's not to late
to help yourself.

685
00:41:00,213 --> 00:41:01,773
Link with me, Odo.

686
00:41:01,818 --> 00:41:04,255
We can escape together.

687
00:41:05,827 --> 00:41:07,389
I... don't...

688
00:41:07,523 --> 00:41:09,994
think... so!

689
00:41:21,991 --> 00:41:24,360
Autodestruct in two minutes.

690
00:41:26,368 --> 00:41:29,170
You've got to regain
control of the ship!

691
00:41:35,055 --> 00:41:36,422
Odo.

692
00:41:42,072 --> 00:41:44,840
I never wanted to harm you.

693
00:42:17,323 --> 00:42:18,291
O'Brien to Bridge.

694
00:42:18,326 --> 00:42:19,294
Go ahead, Chief.

695
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,299
I've restored control
to the helm.

696
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:23,030
She's all yours, Captain.

697
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,835
Hard aport, Major.

698
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,538
Take us away
from the settlement.

699
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:29,143
Computer, end
autodestruct sequence.

700
00:42:29,185 --> 00:42:32,591
Authorization:
Sisko-omega-one-seven abort.

701
00:42:32,627 --> 00:42:34,621
This is Kira Nerys,
First Officer.

702
00:42:34,666 --> 00:42:35,828
I concur.

703
00:42:35,868 --> 00:42:38,636
Autodestruct sequence aborted.

704
00:42:38,675 --> 00:42:41,239
Phaser banks are powering down.

705
00:42:43,152 --> 00:42:44,746
Take us home, Major.

706
00:42:48,097 --> 00:42:50,626
Captain's Log, supplemental.

707
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:53,404
We've returned to the station
without further incident.

708
00:42:53,444 --> 00:42:56,144
However, I'm concerned
about my Chief of Security

709
00:42:56,184 --> 00:42:59,556
who hasn't said a word
since we left Tzenkethi space.

710
00:42:59,591 --> 00:43:01,960
The real Ambassador Krajensky

711
00:43:01,997 --> 00:43:03,694
was supposed to be
on his way to Risa

712
00:43:03,735 --> 00:43:06,867
for an extended vacation,
but he never arrived.

713
00:43:06,909 --> 00:43:09,939
Starfleet Security
believes he's been kidnapped

714
00:43:09,983 --> 00:43:11,577
or possibly killed.

715
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:15,527
What about the coup
on the Tzenkethi homeworld?

716
00:43:15,563 --> 00:43:17,557
It never happened.

717
00:43:17,602 --> 00:43:19,835
Starfleet Command wants

718
00:43:19,874 --> 00:43:21,639
a detailed report
from each of us.

719
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,713
Odo, are you all right?

720
00:43:26,756 --> 00:43:28,020
I'm fine.

721
00:43:29,363 --> 00:43:31,857
I hope I'm not interrupting.

722
00:43:31,903 --> 00:43:32,893
Not at all.

723
00:43:32,938 --> 00:43:34,100
Have a seat.

724
00:43:37,549 --> 00:43:39,041
Captain...

725
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,182
there's something
you need to know.

726
00:43:44,432 --> 00:43:48,203
The changeling,
before he... died

727
00:43:48,241 --> 00:43:50,439
he whispered something to me.

728
00:43:51,917 --> 00:43:53,352
Go on.

729
00:43:54,858 --> 00:43:56,521
He said...

730
00:43:58,533 --> 00:44:01,097
"You're too late.

731
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,166
We are everywhere."
