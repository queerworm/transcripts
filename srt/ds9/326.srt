00:00:01,752 --> 00:00:05,965
<i>Commander's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 48959.1.</i>

2
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:08,926
<i>It is with mixed emotions</i>
<i>that I record this</i>

3
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:10,928
<i>my final Commander's Log.</i>

4
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:12,680
<i>The last three years</i>
<i>have been</i>

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,474
<i>the most demanding</i>
<i>and rewarding of my career.</i>

6
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,726
<i>I can only hope</i>
<i>that the future will hold</i>

7
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,227
<i>even greater challenges.</i>

8
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,980
Dad, there's something
I've been wanting

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,356
to say to you for a long time.

10
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,733
And now that I
finally have the chance,

11
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,194
I'm going to make it
short and simple.

12
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:33,826
Congratulations...

13
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:36,119
<i>Captain</i> Sisko.

14
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,167
Well, now that you have
another pip on your collar,

15
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,669
does that mean
I can't disagree

16
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:44,879
with you anymore?

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,797
No, it just means
I'm never wrong.

18
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:49,466
Oh, we'll see about that.

19
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,593
Curzon would have been
proud of you,

20
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,052
but not as proud as I am.

21
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:55,389
That means a lot to me, Dax.

22
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:59,810
Though I don't
fully understand

23
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,646
this humanoid obsession
with rank and title,

24
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:05,190
if anyone deserves
to be promoted, it's you.

25
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,027
Thank you, Constable.

26
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:10,905
Well, as someone who is
obsessed with rank and title

27
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:13,032
congratulations, Captain.

28
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:14,783
That goes for
me, too, Captain.

29
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,161
This calls
for a toast.

30
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,956
BASHIR: That better not be
from a replicator, Quark.

31
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,958
Chateau Cleon, 2303.

32
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,920
I already put it
on your account.

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,546
Can I?

34
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,590
I guess a sip
won't hurt.

35
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,510
Well...

36
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,848
Here's to the newest and
best Captain in Starfleet,

37
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,601
and all I can say is,
it's about time.

38
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,061
Hear, hear.
Hear, hear.

39
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:43,854
Cheers.

40
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,105
Ah, ah, that's,
that's enough.

41
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,737
Thanks for coming, Ambassador.

42
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:56,784
Those pips look good
on you, Captain.

43
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,327
Though, to be honest,

44
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,872
I'm not really here
for the ceremony.

45
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,707
I had that feeling.

46
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,333
What can I do for you?

47
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,711
Our intelligence
reports indicate

48
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:11,590
there's been a coup d'état
on the Tzenkethi homeworld.

49
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,635
I doubt anyone is going
to miss the Autarch.

50
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:15,970
I know I won't.

51
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:22,559
Unfortunately, it's too early
to tell who's in control,

52
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,020
but we don't want
to take any chances.

53
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,897
We need to remind the Tzenkethi

54
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,774
that the Federation
is committed to protecting

55
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,985
our colonies
near their border.

56
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:32,694
You want to show the flag.

57
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,946
Exactly.

58
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,077
The<i> Defiant</i> will leave in two
days on a week-long patrol.

59
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,870
I'll be coming along
as an observer.

60
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,373
I've heard a lot
about the<i> Defiant.</i>

61
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,835
I'm looking forward
to seeing her in operation.

62
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,753
I don't think
you'll be disappointed.

63
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,254
She's a fine ship.

64
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,172
With a fine crew.

65
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,842
Now what do you say we
get back to the party?

66
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,175
Of course.

67
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:59,721
ALL:
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪

68
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,223
♪ For he's
a jolly good fellow ♪

69
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:05,811
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪

70
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,605
♪ Which nobody can deny. ♪

71
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,606
O'BRIEN:
Hip, hip...

72
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,649
ALL:
Hooray!

73
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:11,817
Hip, hip...
Hooray!

74
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:12,818
Hip, hip...

75
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:13,777
Hooray!

76
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,321
(<i> applause</i> )

77
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,674
I want a complete overhaul

78
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,384
of the deflector
shield generators

79
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,677
and targeting sensors.

80
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,387
Oh, yes-- take on
a full complement

81
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,346
of photon torpedoes.

82
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,639
Don't worry, Captain.

83
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,558
If the Tzenkethi
try to start any trouble,

84
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,559
we'll be ready for them.

85
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,519
I don't doubt it, Chief.

86
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,790
(<i> clattering and thumping</i> )

87
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,211
Captain?

88
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,771
(<i> sighs</i> )

89
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,856
Getting jumpy
in your old age, O'Brien.

90
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:38,273
SISKO:<i> My son, the writer,</i>
<i>thinks I should say</i>

91
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,108
<i>something profound</i>
<i>on this occasion.</i>

92
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,694
<i>He even offered to write me</i>
<i>a brief statement.</i>

93
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,905
<i>I told him</i>
<i>I'd take care of it myself.</i>

94
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,116
<i>But as it turns out, the only</i>
<i>thing I can think of is:</i>

95
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:52,996
<i>Begin Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 48960.9.</i>

96
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,665
So, have you
told her yet?

97
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,252
Told who?

98
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,045
Captain Yates.

99
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,964
About your
promotion.

100
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,092
Yeah, I barely had time

101
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,509
to send my father
a transmission.

102
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,846
In fact, I don't even
know where Kasidy is.

103
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,974
She's hauling a load of
duridium ore to Solais V.

104
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,268
Oh.

105
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:17,271
You could probably
contact her on subspace.

106
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,981
I'd rather tell
her in person.

107
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,192
When's she due back
on the station?

108
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,818
About a month.

109
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,612
A month?!

110
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,322
Ah, there's nothing worse

111
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,324
than a long-distance
relationship.

112
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,243
I wouldn't call it
a relationship, Dax.

113
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,786
I've only taken
her out once.

114
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,372
Okay, twice.

115
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,791
I think the exact
figure is three times.

116
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,043
She's quite
an interesting woman.

117
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,379
She's very independent,
a little opinionated,

118
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,881
but she has
a nice sense of humor.

119
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,174
And...?

120
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:49,386
And? What do you want
me to tell you, Dax?

121
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,595
That you miss her.

122
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,473
That you can't
wait to see her.

123
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,351
I don't know.
Anything.

124
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,061
Kira, O'Brien, Bashir,

125
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:01,022
they're all dying
of curiosity, and...

126
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,607
well, I have to
tell them something.

127
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:07,446
Fine. You tell them
when she gets back,

128
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:10,698
I'm going to take her
to the holosuite,

129
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,409
and we're going to watch

130
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,703
the seventh game
of the 1964 World Series.

131
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,539
You do like her.

132
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,542
Captain on the Bridge.

133
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,543
Ambassador.

134
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,586
Captain.

135
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,132
All stations,
report.

136
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,258
Helm ready.

137
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,468
Weapons ready.

138
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:31,594
Communications systems
standing by.

139
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,847
Warp and impulse engines
are on line.

140
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,224
Seal the airlock,
release docking clamps.

141
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,852
Docking clamps released.

142
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,395
Engage thrusters.

143
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:43,023
Clearing the station.

144
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,817
Lay in a course for the
Tzenkethi border, warp eight.

145
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,694
Aye, aye, Captain.

146
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,570
Engage.

147
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,934
(<i> rumbling creak</i> )

148
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,691
Hello?

149
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,818
Who's there?

150
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,010
(<i> clattering thumps</i> )

151
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,978
Julian!

152
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,272
You called me, Chief?

153
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,690
Why didn't you
answer me?

154
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,111
I had this spanner
in my mouth.

155
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,863
What are you doing here, anyway?

156
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,116
I was connecting
my new diagnostic console

157
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,867
to the Medical Bay's power grid.

158
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,619
Well, I could have
done that for you.

159
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,830
Oh, just putting my engineering
extension courses to work.

160
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,125
Besides, I know
you have your hands full.

161
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,752
Oh.
Where are you going now?

162
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,754
I'm done.

163
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,367
Huh.

164
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,580
Not bad for an extension course.

165
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,436
You wanted
to see me, sir?

166
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,646
Yes, Commander.

167
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:30,190
It's about
Ambassador Krajensky.

168
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,733
Please.

169
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,028
I know Starfleet
doesn't intend

170
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,405
for this to be
a combat mission.

171
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,407
But just in case the Tzenkethi
have other ideas,

172
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,493
I want make sure the Ambassador
is kept out of harm's way.

173
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,036
Yes, sir.

174
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,121
I'll see to it that,
if hostilities do occur,

175
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,999
the Ambassador is
escorted off the Bridge.

176
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,708
He won't like it.

177
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,461
I won't let that bother me.

178
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:52,546
Very good, Commander.

179
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:53,838
That will be all.

180
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:01,888
Captain.

181
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,351
I just want to say that...

182
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,687
I agree with
what Chief O'Brien said

183
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:10,522
about your promotion.

184
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:13,441
It's about time.

185
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,943
I appreciate
the sentiment, Commander,

186
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,862
but it really
doesn't change anything.

187
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,657
I have the assignment I want.
I have the crew that I want.

188
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,868
The rank doesn't
make much difference.

189
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,495
You'd be surprised.

190
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:29,165
People don't enter Starfleet
to become Commanders

191
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,543
or Admirals,
for that matter.

192
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:35,672
It's the Captain's chair
that everyone has their eye on.

193
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,966
That's what I wanted
when I joined up, but...

194
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,928
you don't get to be a Captain
wearing a gold uniform.

195
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:45,265
You could always transfer
from security to command.

196
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,810
Then who would protect
the Ambassador?

197
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,735
Dismissed, Mr. Eddington.

198
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,653
Thank you, sir.

199
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,914
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 48962.5.</i>

200
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,916
<i>We are 12 hours</i>

201
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,543
<i>I haven't been in this area</i>

202
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,003
<i>since the last</i>
<i>Federation-Tzenkethi war.</i>

203
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:20,967
<i>Being here brings back a lot</i>
<i>of memories, most of them bad.</i>

204
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,469
(<i> console beeping</i> )

205
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,762
Captain, we're receiving

206
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,680
a priority one
distress signal

207
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,973
from Barisa Prime,
audio only.

208
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,266
Put it
through.

209
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,976
MALE (<i> staticky</i> ):
Under heavy fire

210
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,394
from Tzenkethi warships.

211
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,562
I don't know how much
longer we can hold out.

212
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,439
Can anyone hear me?

213
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,149
This is...

214
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,734
(<i> transmission cuts off</i> )

215
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,193
Constable?

216
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,820
We've lost contact.

217
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,531
Try to reestablish.

218
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,954
It's no use, Captain.

219
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,624
They're gone.

220
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,341
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

221
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,426
<i>We've been unable</i>
<i>to reestablish contact</i>

222
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,052
<i>with Barisa Prime.</i>

223
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,971
<i>Therefore, I've no choice</i>
<i>but to assume</i>

224
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,183
<i>we are at war</i>
<i>with the Tzenkethi.</i>

225
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,601
Lieutenant,
set a course

226
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,520
for Barisa Prime,
maximum warp.

227
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,272
I want continual scans
for Tzenkethi ships.

228
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,316
Constable, contact
Starfleet Command.

229
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,859
Let them know
what happened.

230
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,653
Major, what
other starships

231
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,237
are in this sector?

232
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,781
The closest one is the<i> Ulysses.</i>

233
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:25,740
They're studying

234
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,575
protoplanetary
masses

235
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,868
in the Hellespont Nebula.

236
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,995
That puts them...

237
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,331
20 hours away at maximum warp.

238
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:36,710
Lieutenant, transmit a message
to Captain Entebe

239
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,836
on the<i> Ulysses.</i>

240
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,170
ODO:
Captain, I'm
having trouble

241
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,630
getting through
to Starfleet Command.

242
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,757
There seems to be
a power fluctuation

243
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:45,134
in the communications system.

244
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,886
I can't get a
message out, either.

245
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,304
The console is
functioning normally.

246
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,640
The problem must be in
the transceiver assembly.

247
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,560
I need that system
back on line, Chief.

248
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,769
I'll get on it
right away.

249
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,229
Lieutenant, I could
use some help.

250
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,230
Major, take the helm.

251
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,481
Yes, sir.

252
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,871
What do you make
of this, Lieutenant?

253
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,789
I've never seen
anything like it.

254
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,332
It's spreading

255
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,126
through the system
like some kind of parasite.

256
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,503
It seems to be linked
to key points

257
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,088
within the
transceiver assembly.

258
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,507
Better get it
out of there.

259
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:25,550
(<i> cries out</i> )

260
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,804
A force field.

261
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:30,805
Come on.

262
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,139
Where are we going?

263
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,934
I want to check the
other command systems.

264
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,811
I have a bad
feeling about this.

265
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:50,575
SISKO: You say these things
are all over the ship?

266
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,118
O'BRIEN:
They've attached themselves

267
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,828
to the command and
communication relays,

268
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,790
the internal sensors,
the transporter,

269
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,041
the deflector
shield grid--

270
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,377
almost every
critical system.

271
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,589
Is there any way to get
past the force fields?

272
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,090
None that
we've found yet.

273
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,884
We're still
working on it.

274
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,343
Hmm.

275
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,431
Well, I guess
the question is

276
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,349
how did they
get aboard?

277
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,393
Or should I say

278
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,145
who placed
them here?

279
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,605
Well, I don't know
who did it,

280
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,231
but I know it
definitely happened

281
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,817
after we left the station.

282
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,820
I ran a systems check
before our departure.

283
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,362
They weren't
there then.

284
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:33,200
Which means someone aboard
this ship is a saboteur.

285
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,035
We've got 47 people on board.

286
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,329
Theoretically, any one of them

287
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,205
could have planted
those devices.

288
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:42,836
Chief?

289
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,297
It's nothing, sir.

290
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:47,966
It's not even worth mentioning.

291
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,510
It doesn't sound like you're
too sure about that.

292
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,763
Well, I did see someone

293
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,307
crawling about in one
of the Jefferies tubes

294
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,308
the other day.

295
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,351
Who?

296
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,228
It was Julian.

297
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,897
He was connecting

298
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,065
a medical console
to the power grid.

299
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:09,445
Which is right next
to the communications relay.

300
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,823
Are you accusing Julian
of sabotage?

301
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:16,327
No one's accusing anyone
of anything, I...

302
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:19,121
But I want to talk to Julian.

303
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,540
Wait.

304
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,750
I think I have a better idea.

305
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:28,214
This crew has been
through a lot together.

306
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:32,134
In fact, I would trust any
one of you with my life.

307
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,761
But after looking
at the evidence,

308
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:37,264
there's only one conclusion
I can draw:

309
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:41,227
Someone on this ship
is guilty of sabotage.

310
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:47,066
With your permission, Captain,
the Constable and I

311
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,777
can begin questioning
the crew immediately.

312
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,612
That won't be necessary.

313
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,780
Lieutenant?

314
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,490
We found one of the devices

315
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,826
planted
in the warp plasma conduit,

316
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,620
which means whoever put it there

317
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,664
would have been exposed
to trace amounts

318
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,541
of tetryon
particles.

319
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:07,378
And those particles would still
be detectable on the saboteur?

320
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,756
Yes, but not
for much longer.

321
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,465
They dissipate
quickly.

322
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,009
So you're going to scan

323
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,261
all the members of the crew
for tetryon particles.

324
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,846
Starting with the senior staff.

325
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,765
O'Brien and I already
scanned positive

326
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,683
since we opened up
the warp core controls

327
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,685
during our
investigation.

328
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:26,522
You realize, of course, that
if no one else tests positive...

329
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,315
We'll be the prime suspects.

330
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,734
Yes, we know that.

331
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:33,529
We might as well get started.

332
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,126
You're clean.

333
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,711
I'm glad to hear it.

334
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:51,380
Might as well
do me next.

335
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,730
You're okay, too.

336
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:12,234
Julian.

337
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,570
Hmm?

338
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,822
Of course.

339
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,009
Nothing.

340
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,426
You sound
relieved.

341
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,886
Well, I am.

342
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,346
After all, you were
in that conduit

343
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,347
the other day.

344
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,473
Ambassador,
if you please?

345
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:43,766
Certainly.

346
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,059
BASHIR:
I was never
in any conduit.

347
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,519
Of course you were.

348
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,687
I saw you there.

349
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:03,410
It's a changeling.

350
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,967
We've cloaked.

351
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,719
Lieutenant,
bring us out of warp.

352
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:21,804
Full stop...

353
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:22,847
now.

354
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,473
Constable, Commander...

355
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,809
deploy security
teams immediately.

356
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,268
I want that changeling found

357
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,311
before he can do
any more damage.

358
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,563
Yes, sir.

359
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:31,605
Captain, the helm's
not responding.

360
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,066
We're still at warp.

361
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,068
I can't deactivate
the cloaking device.

362
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,652
The weapons array is activated.

363
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,987
The phaser banks

364
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,780
are charging.

365
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,533
And we've got photon torpedoes
on line and ready to launch.

366
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,118
The ship's no longer

367
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,162
under our control.

368
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,046
Our security teams
have gone over

369
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,422
every centimeter
of the ship,

370
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,132
checked every
piece of cargo,

371
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:00,134
questioned every
crew member.

372
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,720
We still haven't been able
to find the changeling.

373
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,304
Is there any way
he could have been

374
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,639
transported
off the ship?

375
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,599
At warp?

376
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,142
It's unlikely, but...

377
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,019
with Dominion technology

378
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,812
I suppose
it's possible.

379
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,480
He's still here.

380
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:21,280
He won't leave until he's
completed his mission.

381
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,782
Which is?

382
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:26,994
It looks like the Dominion
is hoping to start a war

383
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,871
between the Federation
and the Tzenkethi.

384
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,539
KIRA:
Well, if you ask me,
the Tzenkethi

385
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,708
are doing a pretty good job
of that all by themselves.

386
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,793
SISKO:
Not necessarily.

387
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,335
The transmission

388
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,214
we received from Barisa Prime
could have been faked

389
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,966
using that device
we found implanted

390
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,508
in the
communications relay.

391
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:45,471
In fact, our entire
mission could have been

392
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:48,015
engineered by
the Dominion.

393
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,725
Think about it.

394
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:53,187
We've been all over this ship
and we have not seen a trace

395
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,648
of the real
Ambassador Krajensky,

396
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,650
nor his remains.

397
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,318
Which means, he was
probably replaced

398
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,736
before we left the station.

399
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,196
Maybe the real Ambassador

400
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:04,490
never came
to Deep Space 9 at all.

401
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,533
So everything Ambassador
Krajensky told us

402
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,576
could have been a lie--

403
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,120
the Tzenkethi
coup d'état,

404
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,455
increased tension
along the border,

405
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,748
the threat of an attack.

406
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,084
And now, here we are, cloaked,

407
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,543
armed for battle

408
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,796
and heading into
Tzenkethi space.

409
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:20,506
If we can't
stop this ship

410
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,133
before we cross
the border,

411
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:23,801
we may wind up
<i>causing</i> a war

412
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,385
rather than
preventing one.

413
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:28,097
Which is, no doubt
what my people are hoping for.

414
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:31,433
A war between the Tzenkethi
and the Federation

415
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,560
would destabilize
the Alpha Quadrant,

416
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,146
making it that much easier

417
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,605
for the Dominion
to move in.

418
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:37,857
EDDINGTON:
I wish the internal sensors

419
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,692
were on line.

420
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,945
It'd make it a lot easier
to track down the changeling.

421
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,989
ODO:
I'm not sure the
sensors would help.

422
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:49,035
If you scan me while I'm a rock,
you'll detect a rock.

423
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:53,122
I may not be able to duplicate
a humanoid perfectly,

424
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,790
but I'm guessing he can.

425
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,293
We scanned Krajensky
for tetryon particles.

426
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:58,376
He registered
as human.

427
00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,753
KIRA:
Well then, right now,

428
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,173
the changeling
could be<i> anything...</i>

429
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:04,300
or anyone on this ship.

430
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,511
Then we have to narrow
his options.

431
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,512
Confine

432
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,722
all nonessential
personnel

433
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:10,931
to their quarters

434
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,390
and seal them in
with force fields.

435
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,143
Doctor, I want
you to review

436
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,811
all the tricorder
readings.

437
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,146
See if you can
find anything

438
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,314
that will help us
find the changeling.

439
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,982
And take some
security with you.

440
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:23,319
From here on,<i> no one</i>
is to be left alone.

441
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:31,369
We have seven hours
before we enter Tzenkethi space.

442
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:33,871
I want that changeling
found before then.

443
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:35,706
EDDINGTON:
That won't be easy.

444
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:38,084
Let's face it, no matter
how many precautions we take,

445
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:40,044
he could replace any one of us,

446
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:42,922
and we won't know it
until it's too late.

447
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,140
Thank you for your cooperation.

448
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,975
Hopefully,
this will be over soon,

449
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,270
and you'll be able
to return to duty.

450
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,775
All right, let's go.

451
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,420
This may take a while.

452
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:28,801
Keep your phasers
on stun

453
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,094
and stay calm.

454
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:31,678
I don't want anyone
getting nervous

455
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,847
and shooting one
of us by mistake.

456
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,437
You sure I can't interest
you in one of these?

457
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:40,687
I don't use them.

458
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,398
Besides, in the history
of my people,

459
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,275
no changeling has
ever harmed another.

460
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:46,235
I'd hate to be the first.

461
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,112
Apparently,<i> that</i> changeling
doesn't feel the same way.

462
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:49,780
If we don't stop him,

463
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,325
no one on board will escape
unharmed, including you.

464
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:54,076
You may be right.

465
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,162
But I've been
a security officer

466
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,955
most of my humanoid
existence,

467
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:00,166
and in all that time, I've
never found it necessary

468
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,793
to fire a weapon
or take a life.

469
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,837
I don't intend
to start now.

470
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,504
This is O'Brien.

471
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:09,425
I need a security team in
the Engine Room immediately.

472
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,141
It must have been
the changeling.

473
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:20,060
I went down the hall to get
an interphasic compensator.

474
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,561
I heard a noise,
and when I came back...

475
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,604
She has a severe
concussion.

476
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,106
Give me a hand.

477
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:25,816
We've got to get her to
the Medical Bay immediately.

478
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,156
Stay here
with the Chief.

479
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:38,371
Damage control team,
report to the Engine Room.

480
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:40,122
MAN: Aye, sir.

481
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,253
(<i> sighs</i> )

482
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,591
Dax is still
unconscious.

483
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,260
I've given her
cortical analeptics

484
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,720
to stabilize
her condition.

485
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,929
She should be all right
in a day or two,

486
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,181
but until then...

487
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:59,183
Is there any way
to speed up the process?

488
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:00,976
I could use a neural stimulator,

489
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,521
but that might cause
irreversible brain damage.

490
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:04,855
I don't
recommend it.

491
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:09,151
Then Chief O'Brien
is going to have

492
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,778
to regain control of the ship
without her.

493
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,781
I'm afraid so.

494
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,075
I should get back to my patient.

495
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,956
The changeling's
very clever.

496
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:26,126
Taking Dax out makes
O'Brien's job a lot harder.

497
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,129
One thing's for sure.

498
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,590
We're not going to start a war
with the Tzenkethi.

499
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:37,137
If O'Brien can't regain control
before we cross the border,

500
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:41,641
I'll have no choice
but to destroy the<i> Defiant.</i>

501
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,945
Our objective is simple.

502
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,947
Find the changeling
and stop him

503
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,656
before he can do
any more damage.

504
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:59,326
We'll break
into two-person teams.

505
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:02,996
Each team will be armed
with phaser rifles.

506
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,582
EDDINGTON:
Now, we've reconfigured
the rifles

507
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:06,292
to fire
an expanding energy pulse.

508
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,793
ODO:
Phasers have
been set

509
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,463
low enough to prevent
damaging equipment,

510
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:13,048
but high enough to
affect the changeling.

511
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,550
SISKO:
The changeling

512
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,469
could be hiding anywhere.

513
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:18,720
He could look like anything.

514
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,889
So we're going to have
to systematically

515
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,309
sweep the ship
with phaser fire.

516
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:26,353
Every conduit, every corridor.

517
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:29,773
If he's out there,
we'll find him.

518
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,025
Any questions?

519
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,570
What if the changeling's
not out there?

520
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,530
What if he's one of us?

521
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,240
SISKO:
That's why everyone

522
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,575
will be in teams.

523
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:42,244
Keep your partner in sight
at all times.

524
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,370
And if we see anyone
without a partner?

525
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,788
Escort them
to the brig.

526
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,333
We don't want
to take any chances.

527
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,627
Let's go.

528
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:09,896
All right, let's go.

529
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,108
After you.

530
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,860
Don't you trust me?

531
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,279
No, I don't.

532
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:21,450
I know exactly how you feel.

533
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:24,786
Follow me.

534
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,931
(<i> sighs</i> )

535
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,811
Don't you ever sweat?

536
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:53,148
No, I don't.

537
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,276
It's the modified phaser beam.

538
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,487
It's heating
up the air.

539
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,656
Hmm.

540
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:03,116
You know,
this would be a lot easier

541
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,369
if we knew where he was hiding.

542
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:06,828
Where would you be
if you were him?

543
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,748
I wouldn't know.

544
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:10,916
I'm not him.

545
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,795
He is one of your people.

546
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:18,424
Now, can't you put yourself
in his position?

547
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:20,884
Try to anticipate
his next move?

548
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:24,597
I've thought about it,
but the truth is

549
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:28,934
I don't understand my people
all that well.

550
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,605
That's too bad.

551
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:35,232
Yes, it is.

552
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:36,316
For all of us.

553
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,258
(<i> whispering</i> ):
Watch my back.

554
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,905
Over here.

555
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,492
On three.

556
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:27,493
One...

557
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:29,035
two...

558
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,954
(<i> groans</i> )

559
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:40,798
This is Sisko.

560
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:43,717
The changeling is
in Jefferies tube 7-A

561
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:44,926
heading to the lower deck.

562
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,886
I'm in pursuit!

563
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,913
The changeling...

564
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,624
he's right over there.

565
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,753
Put your phaser down.

566
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:20,796
It's me, Kira.

567
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,172
We were on our way

568
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:23,799
to meet you and we got
separated for a second.

569
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,384
The next thing I know,
he opens fire.

570
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:26,844
BOLIAN:
You can't fool me.

571
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:28,554
You're the changeling!

572
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:31,390
I saw you come out of that hatch
and go around the corner!

573
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,808
I didn't see anyone!

574
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:34,184
What...

575
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:37,354
Maybe he morphed
into the ventilation system...

576
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:40,733
or maybe he didn't.

577
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:42,526
For all we know,
you may be the changeling.

578
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:44,570
Keep back!

579
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,988
Both of you, put
your weapons down<i> now!</i>

580
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:52,452
I can't do that, Captain.

581
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,787
You heard him!

582
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:03,004
What happened?

583
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,965
How long have
the two of you been apart?

584
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,385
At least a minute.

585
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,929
Then we've got a problem.

586
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,056
Any one of us could be
the changeling.

587
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:16,518
You, Kira, Eddington,
even me.

588
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,353
Not you.

589
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,688
What do you mean?

590
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,981
You're bleeding.

591
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:27,654
I cut my hand
when the changeling attacked me.

592
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,197
What are you getting at?

593
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:32,910
When blood leaves a humanoid
body, it's still blood.

594
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:35,120
But when any part of me
separates

595
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,413
from my
body...

596
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,874
It reverts back
to a gelatinous state.

597
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,963
Sisko to Bashir.

598
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,673
This is Bashir.

599
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:50,135
Doctor, meet us in the
Mess Hall immediately.

600
00:32:58,936 --> 00:33:00,813
This shouldn't take long.

601
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,792
Satisfied?

602
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:24,503
So far.

603
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,463
Who's next?

604
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:28,006
I'll go.

605
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:55,617
I'd say the Major is exactly
who she appears to be.

606
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:57,744
Try not to look
so surprised.

607
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:05,084
There doesn't seem
to be any point

608
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:07,796
in obtaining a sample
from the Constable.

609
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:11,132
I guess that just leaves
the three of us.

610
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,843
Let's get this
over with.

611
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,708
You better come with us.

612
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:55,301
This is ridiculous.

613
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,720
I'm not the changeling.

614
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,096
If I were,
don't you think

615
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,432
I'd put up a little more
of a fight?

616
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:04,895
Inside.

617
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:06,479
You're making
a mistake.

618
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,147
Do as he says!

619
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:11,443
BASHIR:
Will someone

620
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,737
please get me
out of here!

621
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,503
Bridge to Captain Sisko.

622
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,797
Sisko here.

623
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:34,758
Sir, we're entering
Tzenkethi space.

624
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:52,317
Any sign of
Tzenkethi ships?

625
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,527
Sensors aren't picking up
any warp signatures.

626
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:55,779
We've altered course.

627
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:59,866
Our new heading is 015 mark 47.

628
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,869
We're headed directly

629
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,038
for the Tzenkethi settlement
on M'kemas III.

630
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:07,666
How long before we're in weapons
range of the settlement?

631
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,419
12 minutes.

632
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,594
Computer.

633
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,554
This is Captain Benjamin Sisko.

634
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:24,141
Initiate autodestruct sequence.

635
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:27,686
Authorization:
Sisko-alpha-one-alpha.

636
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:31,064
COMPUTER:
Identity confirmed.

637
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:33,525
Additional authorization
required.

638
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,289
This is First Officer
Kira Nerys.

639
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:53,419
Autodestruct authorization:
Kira-beta-two-beta.

640
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,796
COMPUTER:
Identity confirmed.

641
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:57,674
Autodestruct sequence armed.

642
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:04,472
Set the countdown
for ten minutes from my mark.

643
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:09,477
Authorization:
Sisko-one-five destruct.

644
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,234
Mark.

645
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,653
COMPUTER:
Sequence initiated.

646
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,948
Autodestruct
in nine minutes, 55 seconds.

647
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,502
Sisko to O'Brien.

648
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,962
O'Brien here.

649
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:39,132
I could use some good news
right now, Chief.

650
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:40,466
How about this?

651
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,427
I think I may be able
to shut down

652
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:43,929
the changeling's force fields

653
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:46,598
and gain access
to the sabotaged systems.

654
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:49,059
The only problem is
we may lose

655
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:50,435
our force fields, too.

656
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:53,146
COMPUTER:
Autodestruct in seven minutes.

657
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:55,607
Just tell me
how long it will take.

658
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,400
Well, I guess
it'll have to be

659
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,360
less than seven minutes,
won't it?

660
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,820
That'd be my suggestion.

661
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,114
Sisko out.

662
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:03,698
EDDINGTON:
Doctor, how's Lieutenant Dax?

663
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,033
Still unconscious.

664
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,367
The changeling gave
her enough sedative

665
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,493
to keep her under

666
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,578
for days.

667
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:09,913
I've managed
to filter most of it

668
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:11,456
out of her system,
but she'll be out

669
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,582
for another few hours.

670
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:13,625
I wish I could do more.

671
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:14,834
SISKO:
You've done all you can,

672
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:15,919
Doctor.

673
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:18,255
Now it's up to Chief O'Brien.

674
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:20,173
(<i> sighs</i> )

675
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,388
COMPUTER:
Autodestruct in six minutes.

676
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,767
All right,
we're almost there.

677
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:34,395
Now, look, when we
set this device off,

678
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,397
there's a possibility
we may lose

679
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,399
the protective field
around the warp core.

680
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,360
If that happens, this room's
going to heat up real fast.

681
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,363
So give the warp core
a wide berth

682
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,324
or you'll get a dose
of radiation poisoning

683
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,867
even Bashir can't cure.

684
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,539
Where's the
changeling?

685
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:54,749
I lost him
in the conduits.

686
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,375
We haven't seen him.

687
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:00,880
Wait!

688
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,381
It's me,
Odo.

689
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,718
You don't say?

690
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:11,474
Chief, remember
the last time

691
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:14,769
we went kayaking
in the holosuite?

692
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,855
You had lamb stew
for lunch.

693
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,023
That's right.

694
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:19,983
But you forgot
to bring a fork.

695
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:22,110
Anyone could have gotten
that information.

696
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,403
COMPUTER:
Autodestruct in five minutes.

697
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,239
You'd better
make a decision.

698
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,907
We're running
out of time.

699
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:32,204
Look, I've more important
things to do

700
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:34,622
than play
"choose the changeling."

701
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,209
Keep the phaser
on both of them.

702
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,677
KIRA:
The shuttlebay
doors are sealed.

703
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:48,887
The evacuation pods
are locked down.

704
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,388
We have no way out.

705
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,557
Weapons are fully charged
and ready to fire.

706
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,934
Tactical systems
are programming an attack run

707
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,520
on the Tzenkethi
settlement.

708
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,819
Chief, what are you doing?

709
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,488
COMPUTER:
Autodestruct in four minutes.

710
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:08,614
You'll see.

711
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,330
Now!

712
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:17,665
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

713
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,126
COMPUTER: Warning:
Warp core field breach.

714
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,295
Engine Room will be sealed
in ten seconds.

715
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:23,671
Evacuate immediately.

716
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,464
Shut down the main power grid!

717
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,592
(<i> screaming</i> )

718
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:28,885
(<i> grunts</i> )

719
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:29,928
No!

720
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,096
(<i> groans</i> )

721
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,473
COMPUTER:
Engine room sealed.

722
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,060
(<i> gasps</i> )

723
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,402
Why are you protecting
these solids?

724
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:47,528
You don't belong
with them.

725
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,821
You belong with us.

726
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,366
Autodestruct in three minutes.

727
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:52,742
Let go.

728
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:55,245
Don't you see?
You've lost.

729
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:57,455
It's too late
for you to help them,

730
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,791
but it's not to late
to help yourself.

731
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,500
Link with me, Odo.

732
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,962
We can escape
together.

733
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,548
(<i> laboriously</i> ):
I... don't...

734
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:10,093
think... so!

735
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,523
Autodestruct in two minutes.

736
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:29,279
You've got to regain
control of the ship!

737
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:36,411
(<i> weakly</i> ):
Odo.

738
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,836
I never wanted to harm you.

739
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:17,118
(<i> sighs</i> )

740
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:18,203
O'Brien to Bridge.

741
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:19,412
Go ahead, Chief.

742
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:21,331
I've restored control
to the helm.

743
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:23,041
She's all yours, Captain.

744
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,709
Hard aport, Major.

745
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:26,585
Take us away from
the settlement.

746
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:29,088
Computer, end
autodestruct sequence.

747
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:32,425
Authorization:
Sisko-omega-one-seven abort.

748
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:35,678
This is Kira Nerys,
First Officer. I concur.

749
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,556
COMPUTER:
Autodestruct sequence aborted.

750
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,100
Phaser banks are powering down.

751
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,687
Take us home, Major.

752
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:50,609
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

753
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:53,363
<i>We've returned to the station</i>
<i>without further incident.</i>

754
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:56,074
<i>However, I'm concerned</i>
<i>about my Chief of Security,</i>

755
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:59,369
<i>who hasn't said a word</i>
<i>since we left Tzenkethi space.</i>

756
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:01,538
The real Ambassador Krajensky

757
00:43:01,538 --> 00:43:03,331
was supposed to be
on his way to Risa

758
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,623
for an extended vacation,

759
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:06,625
but he never arrived.

760
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:09,670
Starfleet Security
believes he's been kidnapped

761
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,381
or possibly killed.

762
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:12,965
What about the coup

763
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:15,301
on the Tzenkethi
homeworld?

764
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,387
It never happened.

765
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:19,638
Starfleet Command wants

766
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,474
a detailed report
from each of us.

767
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:22,559
(<i> door opens</i> )

768
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,479
Odo, are you
all right?

769
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:27,772
I'm fine.

770
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,233
I hope

771
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:31,692
I'm not interrupting.

772
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,735
Not at all.

773
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,986
Have a seat.

774
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:38,783
Captain...

775
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:41,077
there's something
you need to know.

776
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:48,042
The changeling,
before he... died,

777
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,378
he whispered
something to me.

778
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,256
Go on.

779
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:56,468
He said...

780
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,679
"You're too late.

781
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,932
We are everywhere."
