KIRA:<i> First Officer's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 48521.5.</i>

00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:09,426
<i>Odo and I are returning</i>
<i>to Deep Space 9</i>

3
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:12,513
<i>after reviewing security</i>
<i>procedures at Prophet's</i>
<i>Landing</i>

00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:15,891
<i>the Bajoran colony closest</i>
<i>to the Cardassian border.</i>

5
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:17,768
Those orbital
sensor platforms

6
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,895
should give the colonists
plenty of advance warning

7
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:21,772
in case the Cardassians
ever decide

8
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:23,190
to violate
the new treaty.

9
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:25,567
Hopefully.

10
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,363
How did your meeting

11
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,532
with Security
Chief Bemar go?

12
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,534
Fine.

13
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,035
Was he properly
impressed

14
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,955
by the depth
of your expertise?

15
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,707
(<i> disdainful snort</i> )

16
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:42,835
Odo, is something bothering you?

17
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:45,253
What makes you say that?

18
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,589
Well, for one thing, you
haven't said five words to me

19
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,633
since we left Prophet's Landing.

20
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:50,968
Huh!

21
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:52,761
Look, if I've
done something

22
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,055
to offend you,
I wish you'd tell me what it is.

23
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,227
It's not important.

24
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,896
Whatever you say.

25
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:04,648
Certainly not worth
making an issue about.

26
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,483
Well, glad to hear it.

27
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,985
It's just...

28
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,655
When Governor Avesta

29
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:14,867
invited us to dinner
at his house...

30
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,451
Go on.

31
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,578
You said no.

32
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,496
And?

33
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,082
You never bothered to ask me
if<i> I</i> wanted to go.

34
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,376
You<i> wanted</i> to go to the
Governor's house for dinner?

35
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,878
Not particularly.

36
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:28,422
Well, then, what's the problem?

37
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,799
The problem is you never asked
what I wanted.

38
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,801
Odo, you don't eat.

39
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:36,263
Besides, you hate socializing
with people you don't know.

40
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,391
Well, that's beside the point.

41
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:42,561
I would have liked to have
been consulted, that's all.

42
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,145
You're right.

43
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,856
Next time we are invited
out for dinner

44
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,399
I will make sure<i> you</i> 
are the one

45
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,943
to say no.

46
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:50,652
I'd appreciate that.

47
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,240
(<i> console beeping</i> )

48
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,491
Hold on.

49
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,452
I'm picking up
a wide band

50
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,788
subspace transmission from
a Lissepian supply ship.

51
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:03,916
They've just been attacked
by a Maquis interceptor.

52
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,752
Long-range sensors
are detecting

53
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:09,088
a modified Peregrine-class
courier ship

54
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:13,174
likely armed, one-man crew,
bearing 268 mark 301.

55
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,927
The Maquis use

56
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:16,929
Peregrine-class courier ships.

57
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,847
KIRA: The Lissepians
didn't sustain

58
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,515
any serious damage.

59
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,392
I'm going after him.

60
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,685
Right.

61
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,852
I don't know what
the Maquis have done

62
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,854
to that ship's engines,
but it's fast.

63
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,107
Not fast enough.
We're closing on him.

64
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,524
We better
catch him soon.

65
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,110
We're entering
the Badlands.

66
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,195
Wait a minute, I've lost him.

67
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,239
The Badlands' plasma fields

68
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:42,157
are disrupting
our sensors.

69
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,867
Increase the sensor bandwidth.

70
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,702
That should compensate
for the interference.

71
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,037
I hope you're right.

72
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,580
KIRA: Well, he can't
have gotten far.

73
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,458
He's got to be somewhere
in this solar system.

74
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,626
ODO: There he is.

75
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,294
Looks like
he's trying to land

76
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,922
on one of the moons
orbiting that gas giant.

77
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,506
I'm following him in.

78
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,383
There's something wrong
with his ship.

79
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,095
It looks like his attitude
stabilizers have failed.

80
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,387
Can you get
a transporter lock on him?

81
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,889
ODO: Too much
interference.

82
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,600
He's trying to land
on that moon.

83
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,771
Ah, we've lost him.

84
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,189
Did he make it?

85
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,690
ODO: I don't know.

86
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,818
Something in
the moon's atmosphere

87
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,653
is jamming our sensors.

88
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:23,615
Then I guess we'll have to land
and see for ourselves.

89
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,788
O'BRIEN:<i> O'Brien to Sisko.</i>

90
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,456
Go ahead.

91
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,126
Commander, there's
someone here to see you.

92
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:35,294
SISKO:<i> Who is it?</i>

93
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:36,544
It's Nog.

94
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,921
Nog?

95
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,464
Tell him it's urgent.

96
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,967
He says it's urgent.

97
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,094
Send him in.

98
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,888
I told you he'd see me.

99
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,307
(<i> chuckles</i> )

100
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,898
Commander...

101
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,234
first, let me express
my most sincere thanks

102
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:02,029
for allowing me
to speak with you.

103
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,781
You're welcome.

104
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,117
Now... what is this
all about?

105
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:11,412
I wanted to
give you... this.

106
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,124
Open it.

107
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:22,757
What's this?

108
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,551
It's latinum.

109
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,846
I know it's latinum, but why
are you giving it to me?

110
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,597
Yesterday, I completed

111
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,100
the Ferengi
Attainment Ceremony.

112
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,810
I'm an adult.

113
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,145
Congratulations.

114
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,188
Thank you.

115
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:37,438
But...

116
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,233
that doesn't explain this.

117
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,151
According to Ferengi Bylaws

118
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,279
section 105, subparagraph ten,
upon reaching adulthood

119
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,199
Ferengi males must purchase
an apprenticeship

120
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,784
from a suitable
role model.

121
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,786
I choose you.

122
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,375
You want to be my apprentice?

123
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,126
That's right.

124
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:01,255
I want to be the first Ferengi
in Starfleet.

125
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:04,383
Now, who do I see
about getting a uniform?

126
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:07,594
Nog, if you want to become
a Starfleet officer

127
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,097
you have to attend the Academy.

128
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,890
All right.

129
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,600
Where do I sign up?

130
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,437
It's not that simple.

131
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,606
As a non-Federation citizen

132
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:23,693
you need a letter of reference
from a command-level officer

133
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,905
before you can even take
the entrance exam.

134
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,490
A command-level officer...

135
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,326
you mean, like you.

136
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:35,538
Well, yes... like me.

137
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,332
Then you'll write the letter.

138
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,334
I'll think about it.

139
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,877
Thank you, Commander.

140
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,546
I know you'll make
the right decision.

141
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,222
Aren't you forgetting
something?

142
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,350
Keep it.

143
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,811
Consider it a token
of my appreciation.

144
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,157
(<i> sighs</i> )

145
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,953
ODO:
Tricorders are useless.

146
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,913
The atmospheric ionization
is jamming their transponders.

147
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,581
KIRA: Are you sure he's
in these caverns?

148
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,500
Well, he wasn't in the
wreckage of his ship

149
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,294
and given the weather
conditions on the surface

150
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:23,795
there's no way anyone
could survive out there

151
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:24,921
for very long,
so that leaves...

152
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,756
(<i> rumbling</i> )

153
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,967
That's the third quake
since we got here.

154
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,885
This moon must be
seismically unstable.

155
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,180
The sooner we find our fugitive,
the better off we'll be.

156
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,806
Well, finding him
isn't going to be easy.

157
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,308
These caverns
could go on forever.

158
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,268
And with all this
seismic activity

159
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,478
I don't want to stay here
any longer than we have to.

160
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:40,937
I say we split up.

161
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,563
We meet back here
in 20 minutes

162
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,483
and if we haven't
found him by then

163
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:45,859
we may have to leave
without him.

164
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,402
If he's smart,
he'll let us find him.

165
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:48,653
Federation prison
would be paradise

166
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,737
compared to this place.

167
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,031
Well, let's hope
he's smart.

168
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,615
I'll see you
in 20 minutes.

169
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:59,414
KIRA:<i> Kira to Odo.</i>
<i>Odo, can you hear me?</i>

170
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,999
This is Odo.
I can barely hear you.

171
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,750
<i>Odo, I'm trapped.</i>
<i>I need your help.</i>

172
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,419
<i>Come quickly.</i>
<i>Odo, do you read me?</i>

173
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,214
Stay where you are, Major.
I'm on my way.

174
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,185
KIRA:
Odo, is that you?

175
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,895
I'm right here, Major.

176
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,272
Odo, I'm glad
to see you.

177
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,484
What's wrong?

178
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,403
You're not going to believe
this-- my foot is stuck.

179
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,570
Stuck? How?

180
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,239
I don't know.

181
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,032
I must have stepped
in a fissure or something.

182
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,450
I can't get it loose.

183
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,118
Let me take a look.

184
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,376
It's not a fissure.

185
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,544
Then what is it?

186
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:47,045
Your foot's
been encased

187
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,839
in some kind of crystal.

188
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,260
And from the look of things...

189
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,136
the crystal is spreading.

190
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,062
(<i> rumbling</i> )

191
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,897
ODO: Now, you're sure
you can't pull it loose?

192
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,857
KIRA: Oh, believe me,
I've tried.

193
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,859
Maybe if you
slip your foot
out of your boot?

194
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,361
I can barely feel

195
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,488
my foot, the crystal is
pressing against it so hard.

196
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,323
There's no way
I can get my boot off.

197
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,535
Hold on a minute.

198
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,458
This might
hurt a bit.

199
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,084
Go ahead.

200
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,630
(<i> grunts</i> )

201
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,344
(<i> chuckles</i> )

202
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:41,182
I fail to see the humor
in this situation.

203
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,601
Come on, Odo.

204
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:45,061
It's pretty ridiculous,
don't you think

205
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,523
the two of us being outsmarted
by a chunk of crystal?

206
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,150
Well, I'm not giving up
just yet.

207
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,192
Neither am I.

208
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,778
Hand me my phaser.

209
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,156
You sure this
is a good idea?

210
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,698
If you're not careful...

211
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,576
I may blow off my foot
and give Julian

212
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,495
the chance to prove
what a wonderful doctor he is?

213
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,663
Don't worry, I have
no intention of giving him

214
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,664
the opportunity.

215
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,832
Stand back.

216
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,927
I guess that wasn't
such a good idea after all.

217
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,554
The crystal formation

218
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:22,349
seems to have somehow
fed off the energy

219
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,225
from your phaser.

(<i> sighs</i> )

224
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,617
I can't contact
the runabout.

225
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,369
There's too much
interference.

226
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:45,246
I'll have to walk back
to the landing site

227
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,457
and try to transport
you from there.

228
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,631
Are you worried
about leaving me here?

229
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,177
Now that you mention it, yes.

230
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,346
I'll be fine, Odo.

231
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:05,058
I promise not to go anywhere.

232
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:23,284
Nog, hand me that
phase matrix recalibrator.

233
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,119
Here you are,
Father.

234
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,829
QUARK:
Is it fixed yet?

235
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:27,997
Not yet, Brother.

236
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,541
What's taking
so long?

237
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,167
We're working
as fast as we can.

238
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,919
The replicators'
entire power supply grid

239
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,462
has been shorted out.

240
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,590
I told you, Brother,
if you don't shut down

241
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,966
your replicators at least once
a week for routine maintenance

242
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,801
you risk system overloads
like this one.

243
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,929
You said it might
overload the system,<i> might.</i>

244
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,390
NOG: He tried to warn you,
Uncle Quark.

245
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,807
You should have
listened to him.

246
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,268
No, it's my fault.

247
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,478
I should have
explained it better.

248
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,770
Of course it's your fault.

249
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,939
Everything that goes wrong

250
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,190
here is your fault.

251
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,734
It says so

252
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,694
in your contract.

253
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:00,154
Now, this mess had better be
cleaned up before lunchtime

254
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,865
or I'm taking the losses
out of your pay.

255
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,285
Of course, Brother.

256
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,039
Um... I need to get
a replacement power coupling

257
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,832
from the storage room.

258
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,501
I'll be right back.

259
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,220
Hey, Nog, what's going on?

260
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,846
If you're here
to order lunch

261
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,057
you'll have to come
back in an hour.

262
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,517
Actually, I just ate.

263
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,644
Hey, that was
a pretty funny joke

264
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:31,936
you pulled on my dad
this morning.

265
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,271
What?

266
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,022
You know-- about wanting
to join Starfleet.

267
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,107
I wasn't joking.

268
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,816
Come on, Nog.

269
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,986
You don't really expect me
to fall for that one.

270
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:43,030
Did you tell your
father I was joking?

271
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,949
Yeah. Kind of.

272
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,618
How could you do that to me?

273
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,202
I want you
to go back to your father

274
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,746
and tell him
that you were wrong.

275
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,498
All right, calm down.

276
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,958
I mean, how was I supposed
to know you were serious?

277
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,711
You never said you wanted
to join Starfleet before.

278
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,837
I'm saying it now.

279
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,548
So what brought this on?

280
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,092
I have my reasons.

281
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,927
Okay, name one.

282
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,053
Why should I?

283
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,722
Because I'm your friend

284
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,349
and friends don't keep secrets
from one another.

285
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,017
It's not a secret.

286
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,978
I just don't feel
like talking about it.

287
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,188
Why?

288
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,190
Because it's personal.

289
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,610
Now, stop asking me.

290
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,822
All right, but my father's
a pretty smart guy

291
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,115
and if this is
some kind of trick

292
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,242
he's going
to figure it out.

293
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,537
There's nothing to figure out.

294
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,206
I'm joining Starfleet,
and that's that.

295
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:39,420
Now, if you don't mind,
I have a lot of work to do.

these coordinates

I think he was as
surprised as I was.

He fired at me
from over there

334
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,012
and when I shot back, he
ran off down the tunnel.

Don't worry.

would be best.

358
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,568
and I've put an order
in with Garak

359
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,694
for some new baby clothes.

360
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:50,862
Count me in.

361
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:51,946
Aye, sir.

362
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,573
Ensign Pran... hmm.

363
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,872
Commander Sisko, have
you made up your mind yet

364
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:02,498
about my letter?

365
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,917
Not exactly.

366
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,377
What does that mean,
"not exactly"?

367
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:08,838
Look, Nog, I have
to be honest with you.

368
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,925
When I think of candidates
for Starfleet Academy

369
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,427
yours is not the first name
that comes to mind.

370
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,554
Why not? Because
I'm a Ferengi?

371
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,138
Not at all.

372
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,474
The fact is, your reputation
on this station

373
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,935
leaves a lot to be desired.

374
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,437
Your school grades
are mediocre at best

375
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,898
and you've had more
than a few run-ins

376
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:28,441
with Constable Odo.

377
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,234
Okay, okay, so I've
made some mistakes.

378
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,861
I admit that.

379
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,446
But I could do better.

380
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,155
Just give me a chance.

381
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,497
You wanted
to see me, Benjamin?

382
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,291
Lieutenant, I need
a complete inventory

383
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,126
of the contents
of Cargo Bay 12.

384
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,087
Didn't we inventory
12 last week?

385
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,797
I'd like it done again.

386
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,590
All right, I'll assign
a crew to it immediately.

387
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,550
Actually, I already have

388
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,885
someone in mind
for the job.

389
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,887
Really? Who?

390
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,680
Nog.

391
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,932
Nog.

392
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:02,683
He's asked for
a recommendation

393
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:03,893
to Starfleet Academy.

394
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,185
Nog?

395
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,187
My reaction exactly.

396
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,148
I always thought
it would be interesting

397
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,276
to have a Ferengi
in Starfleet... but Nog?

398
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,112
I know it seems unlikely

399
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:16,072
but before I
make up my mind

400
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:19,241
I want to give him
a chance to prove himself.

401
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,744
Commander, there's
a lot of valuable equipment

402
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,162
in Cargo Bay 12.

403
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,414
I know.

404
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,874
Maybe I should assign

405
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,502
a couple of crew members
to assist him.

406
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,921
No, I want him
to do it alone--

407
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,840
no help, no interference

408
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,092
no one looking
over his shoulder.

409
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,305
(<i> deep sigh</i> )

410
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,517
I wish I could
analyze this material.

411
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,145
Too bad our tricorders
don't work.

412
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:50,023
Or our communicators
or the transporter.

413
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,399
Our fugitive
couldn't have chosen

414
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,193
a better place to hide.

415
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,030
Very convenient,
don't you think?

416
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,282
You make it sound like
he planned on trapping us.

417
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:03,161
Well, maybe he did,
but it's not going to work.

418
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:04,745
I'm going to get you
out of here.

419
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,875
How long do you think
I have, Odo?

420
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,668
Long enough.

421
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:14,254
I figure at the rate
the crystal's been growing...

422
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,924
I'm going to be
completely covered

423
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,259
in less than 12 hours.

424
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,057
Unless this cave
collapses first.

425
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:27,018
There has<i> got</i> to be a way
to shatter this crystal!

426
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:28,853
I'm sure there is,
but that doesn't mean

427
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,479
we're going to find it
in less than 12 hours!

428
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,272
We'll find it.

429
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,323
Major...

430
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,661
do you ever look
at the criminal activity reports

431
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,747
we get
from Starfleet Security?

432
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,541
Not often.

433
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,168
Well, you should.

434
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,128
They make
fascinating reading.

435
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:56,547
A few months ago,
we got a report

436
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,507
on a theft on Remmil VI.

437
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,427
It seems the natives
there spin a kind

438
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,470
of crystalline webbing
that they use

439
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,847
to construct
their buildings.

440
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,515
A band of
Nausicaan raiders

441
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,517
broke into their
Central Museum

442
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:12,021
by using a high-frequency
ultrasonic generator

443
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:15,816
to create a sympathetic
vibration inside the webbing

444
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:16,943
and shatter it.

445
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,444
So all we need to do

446
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:19,862
is find a band
of Nausicaan raiders

447
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,781
and ask them to give us a hand?

448
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:26,368
No, I might be able to put
together a makeshift generator

449
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:30,206
using the covariant oscillator
on the runabout.

450
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,791
Ah, the trick will be

451
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,918
finding the right
frequency to create

452
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,545
a sympathetic vibration
inside this crystal.

453
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,923
I'm going to have
to go back to the runabout

454
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,549
start assembling the generator.

455
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,468
Keep your phaser handy in case

456
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,886
our friend decides
to come back.

457
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,263
I will.

458
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:47,598
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

459
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,016
Constable...

460
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,977
when we get
back to the station

461
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,603
I'm going to
start reading

462
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,563
those criminal
activity reports.

463
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,774
I'll make sure
you get them.

464
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,492
DAX:
Due to a computer error

465
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,203
we lost the manifest
on this entire cargo bay.

466
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,080
Commander Sisko
would like you

467
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,873
to re-inventory
its contents.

468
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,374
The entire cargo bay?

469
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,417
That's right.

470
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,669
By myself?

471
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,421
Look, Nog,
Starfleet isn't just

472
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,966
about diplomacy,
exploration.

473
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:25,511
A lot of the time,
it's just hard work.

474
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:28,472
When does Commander
Sisko want it done?

475
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:31,017
He would like
the manifest on his desk

476
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,810
first thing
in the morning.

477
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,312
He'll have it tonight

478
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:35,688
before he goes off duty.

479
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,940
Tomorrow morning
will be fine, Nog.

480
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,151
Now, if you don't
mind, Lieutenant

481
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:42,195
I'd like
to get started.

482
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,498
How long do you think
it's going to be

483
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,251
before the generator
finds the right frequency?

484
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,838
It's hard to say.

485
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:05,134
It could take hours.

486
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:09,513
I don't suppose there's
any way to speed things up.

487
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:12,933
I didn't think so.

488
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,813
Don't worry, Major.

489
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:21,067
I have every intention of
getting us back to the station

490
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,776
by tomorrow night.

491
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,696
Chief O'Brien is counting on it.

492
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,907
What does O'Brien
have to do with it?

493
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,661
We... have an appointment.

494
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,580
What kind of appointment?

495
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,668
Talk to me, Odo.

496
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,795
It helps pass the time.

497
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,591
The, uh, Chief and I

498
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,635
are supposed to go
kayaking together

499
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,012
in a holosuite.

500
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:52,306
You're kidding.

501
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:53,682
How did he talk you

502
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,268
into that one?

503
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:58,896
He didn't "talk me"
into anything.

504
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:01,274
It's really quite enjoyable.

505
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:02,566
You mean, you've done it before?

506
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,817
Twice.

507
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,778
He invited me
one evening

508
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:08,906
and seeing I had
no plans, I accepted.

509
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:11,575
I'm sorry. I'm just
having trouble

510
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,745
imagining the two of you
together in a boat.

511
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,163
Well, if it helps any

512
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,040
he's the one who
does all the singing.

513
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,541
He sings?

514
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,419
He says it's necessary

515
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:24,630
to establish
a smooth paddling rhythm.

516
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,673
This gets
better and better.

517
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,217
What kinds of songs
does he sing?

518
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,761
Ancient human
sea chanteys, mostly.

519
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:35,349
He's particularly fond
of one called "Louie, Louie."

520
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:43,816
I never pictured O'Brien
as the nautical type.

521
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,985
Next to his work
and his family

522
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:49,363
shooting the rapids is
his favorite activity.

523
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:53,742
He's had the holo-program
since he was on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

524
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:57,246
How long do these
boat trips usually take?

525
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,206
That depends.

526
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,833
On what?

527
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:04,170
On how many times
we capsize.

528
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,880
It must be a very
difficult program.

529
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,842
It's extremely difficult.

530
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,135
According to him

531
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:12,845
he's dislocated
his shoulder

532
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,388
half a dozen times

533
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,640
trying to make it
down those rapids.

534
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,976
Then why does
he keep doing it?

535
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,394
Because he loves it.

536
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:22,396
And it's been
my observation

537
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:24,815
that you humanoids
have a hard time

538
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:26,942
giving up
the things you love

539
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,778
no matter how much
they might hurt you.

540
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,739
I'm glad you're here, Odo.

541
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,992
I'm glad I'm here, too.

542
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,872
Odo!

543
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:47,505
(<i> rocks thudding</i> )

544
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:58,807
Major...
I'm all right.

545
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,600
What about the generator?

546
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,269
It's fine.

547
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,480
It still hasn't found
the right frequency

548
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,563
to shatter the crystal.

549
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,107
Tell it to hurry.

550
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,859
A couple more tremors
like that last one

551
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,403
and this whole cave is
going to collapse.

552
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:11,569
Well, we'll just
have to make sure

553
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:13,197
that doesn't happen.

554
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,408
After all, we've been
in worse situations

555
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,659
than this one
and come out all right.

556
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,661
Name three.

557
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,791
I can't think of any, either.

558
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:27,669
No, it... it's not that.

559
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,047
It's just that...

560
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,674
that wasn't
the response I expected.

561
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,135
What do you mean?

562
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,762
In the
detective novels

563
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,596
Chief O'Brien
gives me to read

564
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,349
when the hero says

565
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:44,478
"We've been in tougher
situations than this one"

566
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,813
his friends
always agree.

567
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,316
I never read
any of those books.

568
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:54,488
Well, there must be
some humanoid platitude

569
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,490
I can use to cheer you up.

570
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,866
I don't have

571
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,786
much use
for platitudes, Odo.

572
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:03,497
I'd rather face the truth
of a situation

573
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,707
and go on
from there.

574
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,501
I feel the same way.

575
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,002
I know you do.

576
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,629
That's why you and I
get along so well.

577
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,924
I suppose it is.

578
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:16,510
But, in this case,
the truth is

579
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:20,013
we're going to get
you out of here, Major

580
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,141
and that's no platitude.

581
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,395
I must admit,
this is impressive work.

582
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:27,896
Incredible
is more like it.

583
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,065
He inventoried
the whole cargo bay

584
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,484
in under five hours.

585
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:33,193
You're sure
he didn't have any help?

586
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,195
According to the
internal sensors

587
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,406
no one else entered
that cargo bay

588
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:39,283
the entire time
he was there.

589
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:41,410
I guess he did learn something

590
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,912
working
in his uncle's storeroom.

591
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,290
I assume
that all of our equipment

592
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,417
is where it's supposed to be?

593
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,877
If you're asking
if he stole anything

594
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,421
the answer is no.

595
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,256
He even found some
things we missed

596
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,133
on our last
inventory.

597
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,802
Okay. So now we know
he's a hard worker.

598
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,179
The question remains

599
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,057
why does he want
to join Starfleet?

600
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,226
I have no idea.

601
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,978
I don't understand it.

602
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:09,396
I've run through

603
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,315
the entire
harmonic spectrum

604
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,275
and none of
the frequencies

605
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,819
have had any effect
on the crystal.

606
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,488
It's almost as if

607
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:19,906
the structure of
the crystal is mutating

608
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:23,118
to keep us from finding
the right frequency.

609
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,078
(<i> weakly</i> ):
Odo?

610
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,331
Yes, Major?

611
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,625
(<i> gasps</i> )

612
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:32,919
Oh, I wish there was

613
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,005
something else
I could do.

614
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:38,050
Just keep talking to me.

615
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,013
What do you
want me to say?

616
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:45,057
Anything.
Tell me a story.

617
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:48,060
A story?

618
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,520
I know.

619
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,897
Tell me how you
got your name.

620
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,857
My name?

621
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,775
Ah...

622
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:58,862
now that you mention it,
that<i> is</i> an amusing story.

623
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,531
Tell it to me.

624
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:02,782
Well...

625
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,579
as you know,
when Dr. Mora

626
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,664
first brought me
to his laboratory

627
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,957
it was under
Cardassian supervision.

628
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,668
All specimens
had to be

629
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:15,003
clearly labeled
in Cardassian

630
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,130
so the Overseers
would always know

631
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:22,010
what the scientists
were working on.

632
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:26,348
Since no one was
exactly sure what I was

633
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:30,143
Mora labeled me
"unknown sample"

634
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,979
which the Overseer
translated

635
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:36,108
into Cardassian
as<i> odo'ital.</i>

636
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:40,070
So your name
is "unknown sample"?

637
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,905
No... no.

638
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:47,703
<i>Odo'ital</i> literally means
the word "nothing."

639
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:51,498
Even after it became
clear that I was sentient

640
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:55,043
the Bajoran scientists
kept calling me that.

641
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:59,214
As a joke, they split
it into two words

642
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,593
like a Bajoran name:
"Odo Ital."

643
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:04,177
Which eventually
got shortened...

644
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,137
To Odo.

645
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,263
Ah.

646
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:07,556
(<i> rumbling</i> )

647
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:14,062
But now the thing is,
for the longest time

648
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,398
whenever anyone
would use my name

649
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:18,567
the first thing
I would think of

650
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,653
was what it meant:
"Nothing."

651
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:22,613
What better way
to describe me?

652
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:24,114
I had no family,
no friends

653
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:25,907
no place where
I belonged.

654
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,452
I thought it was
the most appropriate name

655
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,329
anyone could give me...

656
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,957
and then I met you...

657
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:41,214
and the others-- Sisko, Dax,
even Quark.

658
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,008
And now...

659
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:47,346
when I hear one of
you call me "Odo"

660
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:50,390
I no longer think of myself
as nothing.

661
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,851
I think of myself as me.

662
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:59,232
(<i> weeping quietly</i> )

663
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,073
I'm sorry, Major.

664
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,493
I guess that story
wasn't as amusing

665
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:11,370
as I hoped it would be.

666
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,122
No, I liked it very much.

667
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,045
The ultrasonic
generator

668
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,255
isn't going to work, is it?

669
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,345
No, I'm afraid it's not.

670
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,809
I don't suppose...

671
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:36,311
you have any other ideas?

672
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,397
(<i> sighs</i> )

673
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,148
I wish I had.

674
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,861
Neither do I.

675
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:47,155
It doesn't make sense.

676
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,492
The ultrasonic generator
should have worked.

677
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,619
Something's not right here.

678
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,705
Odo...

679
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:57,207
you've done
your best.

680
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:59,543
It's time for you to go.

681
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:00,960
Go?

682
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,504
This place is
going to collapse

683
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,423
any minute.

684
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,842
The Maquis is probably dead
from one of the cave-ins.

685
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,302
There's nothing more
you can do for me.

686
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:12,097
If you're asking me to leave...

687
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,558
As your superior officer

688
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:17,686
I'm telling you
to take the runabout

689
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:19,479
and get the hell

690
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,398
off this moon.

691
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:23,442
That's an order.

692
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:29,615
(<i> gasping</i> )

693
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,206
Odo, why are you
still standing there?

694
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,792
I told you
to get out of here.

695
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:41,334
I'm not leaving.

696
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:44,713
Constable, I gave you
a direct order.

697
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,423
You can order me all you want.

698
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,884
As of now,
I'm resigning my commission.

699
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:52,471
Odo, if you stay here,
you'll die.

700
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:53,597
You don't
know that

701
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:56,308
for certain!

702
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:59,603
And even if it were true,
I'm not going to abandon you.

703
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,358
I want you to get out of here.

704
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,985
Don't you understand?

705
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,320
I can't!

706
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,614
You have to.

707
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:12,699
Odo, please.

708
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:20,582
No, I<i> won't</i> leave you!

709
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:21,917
Why?!

710
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,752
Because!

711
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:29,048
Because...

712
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:33,303
I'm in love with you.

713
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,982
So...

714
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:48,610
now you know.

715
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,070
Odo...

716
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:57,661
I'm in love with you, too.

717
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,378
You wanted to see me, Commander?

718
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:10,423
Nog...

719
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,885
I've given your request
a lot of thought.

720
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:15,303
I appreciate that, Commander.

721
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:19,182
But I'm afraid I'm going
to have to turn you down.

722
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,767
Turn me down?
Why?

723
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,686
Did I do something wrong?

724
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:24,646
It's not anything
you did, Nog.

725
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:27,774
You're just not
Academy material.

726
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,151
Here...

727
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,778
this belongs to you.

728
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,364
Commander, can't we
talk about this?

729
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:36,199
There's nothing to talk about.

730
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,535
We both know you'd never make it
through the Academy.

731
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:40,996
You couldn't handle the workload
or the discipline.

732
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:43,040
You wouldn't last two weeks.

733
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,207
That's not true.

734
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,584
I'm a hard worker!

735
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:46,626
I proved that to you!

736
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,420
It doesn't matter.

737
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,881
And I'm not going to put
my reputation on the line

738
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:52,883
just to satisfy
some whim of yours.

739
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:54,426
It's not just a whim.

740
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,595
I'm serious
about joining Starfleet.

741
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:57,679
I don't have time

742
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,639
for this, Nog.

743
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,059
Now, whatever little scheme
you had, you can forget it.

744
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:04,019
I'm not giving you that letter.

745
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,813
It's not a joke
or a scheme.

746
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:09,066
I want to join
Starfleet.

747
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:10,943
I want it more
than anything

748
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:12,652
I've ever wanted
in my life.

749
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:16,364
You're a Ferengi.

750
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:19,785
Why would you want
to be in Starfleet?

751
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:22,037
Where's the profit in it?

752
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,956
I don't care
about profit!

753
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:25,791
Then what do
you care about?

754
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,667
Come on, Nog, tell me!

755
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,754
Why is it so damned important
that you get into Starfleet?

756
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,297
Why are you
doing this?

757
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:36,509
Because I don't want
to end up like my father!

758
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,016
Your... father.

759
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:44,225
That's right.

760
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,894
My<i> father.</i>

761
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,983
He's been chasing profit
his whole life

762
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:53,026
and what has it gotten him?

763
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,611
Nothing.

764
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:57,447
And you
know why?

765
00:35:57,447 --> 00:36:00,199
Because he doesn't have
the lobes.

766
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:04,913
And neither do I.

767
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,003
And "a Ferengi
without profit..."

768
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:13,005
"...Is no Ferengi at all."

769
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:16,091
The 18th Rule of Acquisition.

770
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:24,557
My father
is a mechanical genius.

771
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:28,020
He could have been
Chief Engineer of a starship

772
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,439
if he'd had the opportunity.

773
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:35,568
But he went into business,
like a good Ferengi.

774
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:38,030
The only thing is, he's not

775
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,572
a good Ferengi.

776
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:42,034
Not when it comes
to acquiring profit.

777
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:44,577
So now, all he has to live for

778
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:48,081
is the slim chance
that someday, somehow

779
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:50,876
he might be able
to take over my uncle's bar.

780
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:56,089
Well, I'm not going to make
the same mistake.

781
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:58,175
I want to do something
with my life--

782
00:36:58,175 --> 00:37:00,510
something
worthwhile.

783
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,179
Like joining Starfleet?

784
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:06,141
I may not have an
instinct for business

785
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:08,560
but I have
my Father's hands

786
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,312
and my Uncle's tenacity.

787
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,899
I know I've got
something to offer.

788
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:17,276
I just need the chance
to prove it.

789
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:26,369
All right.

790
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,331
I'll see
that you get that chance.

791
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,334
(<i> laughs</i> )

792
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,545
You're going to recommend me
to Starfleet Academy?!

793
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,882
I'll send the letter the first
thing tomorrow morning.

794
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:42,052
Commander, I don't
know how to thank you!

795
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:44,387
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

796
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,139
Don't thank me yet.

797
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:48,307
You still have a lot
of work ahead of you.

798
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,060
Don't worry.

799
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,270
You're never going
to regret this.

800
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:59,485
(<i> strained</i> ):
Odo?

801
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,821
Yes, Major?

802
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:05,283
You haven't said a word
to me in over an hour.

803
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:10,872
I've just been going over
a few things in my mind.

804
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,086
I'm sorry I
waited so long

805
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:18,588
to tell you
how I feel about you.

806
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:22,968
If I'd told
you earlier

807
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:25,762
maybe things would
have been different.

808
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:28,014
Ah.

809
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:31,434
What are you smiling about?

810
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,938
I think I've finally figured out
what's going on here.

811
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:36,606
This whole situation

812
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,524
hasn't seemed right
since the beginning.

813
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,777
There have been
too many coincidences

814
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:43,696
too many unanswered questions.

815
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,491
Are you still trying
to prove that this is

816
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,743
all some kind of conspiracy?

817
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:51,746
You said the Maquis was standing
here when he shot at you?

818
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,081
That's right.

819
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:54,666
How tall was he?
My height?

820
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,461
No...

821
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,838
maybe shorter.

822
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,798
Like this?

823
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,300
More or less.

824
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,718
What does it matter, anyway?

825
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:08,180
It matters
because, from this position

826
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,556
you're blocking
those phaser hits.

827
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:13,226
There's no way
someone standing here

828
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:14,978
could hit those rocks

829
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,771
without hitting you first.

830
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,899
Maybe he was standing
somewhere else.

831
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,694
Maybe...

832
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,904
or maybe you were lying to me.

833
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:28,283
Which makes two times
you've lied to me today.

834
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:30,702
What are you talking about?

835
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:33,830
You lied when you said
you were shot at by the Maquis

836
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:36,124
and you lied
when you said you loved me.

837
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,043
I<i> do</i> love you.

838
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:41,462
I wish you did, but you don't.

839
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:44,841
Remember, Major, I pride myself
on my ability to observe

840
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:47,010
human nature,
and I've watched you

841
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,720
for the past
three years.

842
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,471
In all that time,
I never saw any indication

843
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,058
that you had
those kind of feelings for me.

844
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:54,809
You like me...

845
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,395
you think of me
as a close friend...

846
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,064
but love?

847
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:00,857
I'm afraid not.

848
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:05,403
Maybe I told you I loved you
because I thought...

849
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,906
it would make you feel better.

850
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:11,284
Because I thought
that's what you wanted to hear.

851
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:13,619
You're lying again.

852
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:17,040
The Kira I know

853
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,918
has far too much regard
for our friendship

854
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,211
to lie to me...

855
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:23,171
even for the best
of reasons.

856
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:25,298
Odo, I can explain.

857
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:27,092
Good.

858
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:30,011
And you can start
by telling me

859
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:33,014
who you are and what
you've done with Kira.

860
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,200
Well done, Odo.

861
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,287
You really are
quite a skillful investigator.

862
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:56,955
(<i> sighs</i> )

863
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,832
And you're quite
a skillful changeling.

864
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:02,668
You still have
much to learn.

865
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,921
If you want to
share your wisdom

866
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:06,839
tell me where Major Kira is.

867
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,216
Close by.

868
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,842
You were the fugitive

869
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,094
we were chasing,
weren't you?

870
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,220
That's correct.

871
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,930
(<i> sighs</i> )

872
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,724
How did you get your hands
on a Maquis ship?

873
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,436
Now, Odo, you really
can't expect me

874
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:21,604
to give you
all the answers.

875
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,440
But why lead us here?

876
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,483
Why replace Major Kira?

877
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,277
(<i> rumbling</i> )

878
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:29,862
I needed to understand
why you chose

879
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,530
to live with the solids

880
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,366
rather than
your own people.

881
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:37,954
I suspected it had something
to do with Major Kira.

882
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:40,832
Now, I'm certain of it.

883
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:43,542
So your plan was
to let me think she died.

884
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:46,921
You thought that would take away
my link to the solids?

885
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,881
Then you would return to us.

886
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:52,927
I assure you nothing
will ever make me do that.

887
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,971
I wouldn't be so sure.

888
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:57,390
Tell me where she is.

889
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:00,352
And if I don't, then what?
You'll shoot me?

890
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:04,897
No changeling has
ever harmed another.

891
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:08,276
There's always
a first time.

892
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,407
Major Kira is
down that tunnel

893
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:16,575
200 meters
south of here.

894
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:19,204
Save her, if it suits you

895
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:22,081
but it won't make
any difference.

896
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,876
She is never going to love you.

897
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:27,045
How could she?

898
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:29,839
You are a changeling.

899
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,110
Major, wake up!

900
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,029
Odo, what happened?

901
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,322
What am I doing here?

902
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:56,282
It's a long story.

903
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,410
Right now, we have to get
you back to the<i> Mekong.</i>

904
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:09,003
There's one thing
I still don't understand.

905
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:12,090
If that Founder
was trying to test

906
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,717
your allegiance
to the solids

907
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,928
why did she
impersonate me?

908
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:18,637
I suppose it's because

909
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:21,558
you happened to be
with me in the runabout.

910
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:23,642
It could have just
as easily been

911
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,644
Commander Sisko,
Doctor Bashir...

912
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,646
What finally made you
realize the truth?

913
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,315
Well, she eventually
made a mistake.

914
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,568
She said something
I know you would never say.

915
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:32,860
What was that?

916
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,987
Just a slip
of the tongue...

917
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,615
nothing important.

918
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,452
I tell you,
I won't stand for it.

919
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:42,036
No nephew of mine

920
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,622
is going to disgrace
our family name

921
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,125
by joining
Starfleet.

922
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,960
But, Uncle Quark...

923
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,087
My mind is made up.

924
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:52,380
QUARK: I forbid it.

925
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,382
No, you don't.

926
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,175
Rom, stay out of this.

927
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,927
I will not.

928
00:43:57,927 --> 00:44:00,721
When it comes to the bar,
you may be in charge

929
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,724
but, when it comes to my son,
I make the decisions.

930
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,435
Fine.

931
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:07,353
You tell him he can't go.

932
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:11,357
Nog...

933
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,984
good luck.

934
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:16,446
I would be proud
to have a son in Starfleet.

935
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:18,531
You're both insane.

936
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,289
Like father, like son.
