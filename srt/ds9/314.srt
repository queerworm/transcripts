1
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:08,777
First Officer's Log,
Stardate 48521.5.

2
00:00:08,811 --> 00:00:10,748
Odo and I are returning
to Deep Space 9

3
00:00:10,783 --> 00:00:13,620
after reviewing security
procedures at Prophet's Landing

4
00:00:13,656 --> 00:00:17,062
the Bajoran colony closest
to the Cardassian border.

5
00:00:17,098 --> 00:00:18,761
Those orbital sensor platforms

6
00:00:18,802 --> 00:00:21,069
should give the colonists
plenty of advance warning

7
00:00:21,175 --> 00:00:22,906
in case the Cardassians
ever decide

8
00:00:22,945 --> 00:00:24,278
to violate the new treaty.

9
00:00:25,685 --> 00:00:26,675
Hopefully.

10
00:00:29,127 --> 00:00:32,568
How did your meeting
with Security Chief Bemar go?

11
00:00:32,602 --> 00:00:34,937
Fine.

12
00:00:34,974 --> 00:00:39,144
Was he properly impressed
by the depth of your expertise?

13
00:00:40,755 --> 00:00:43,819
Odo, is something bothering you?

14
00:00:43,862 --> 00:00:46,460
What makes you say that?

15
00:00:46,502 --> 00:00:48,666
Well, for one thing, you
haven't said five words to me

16
00:00:48,707 --> 00:00:51,144
since we left Prophet's Landing.

17
00:00:51,247 --> 00:00:52,146
Huh!

18
00:00:52,249 --> 00:00:53,445
Look, if I've done something

19
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:56,186
to offend you,
I wish you'd tell me what it is.

20
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,329
It's not important.

21
00:01:01,371 --> 00:01:03,102
Whatever you say.

22
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:05,670
Certainly not worth
making an issue about.

23
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:07,583
Well, glad to hear it.

24
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,146
It's just...

25
00:01:10,325 --> 00:01:12,694
When Governor Avesta

26
00:01:12,732 --> 00:01:16,002
invited us to dinner
at his house...

27
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,508
Go on.

28
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:19,012
You said no.

29
00:01:19,047 --> 00:01:20,346
And?

30
00:01:20,383 --> 00:01:23,322
You never bothered to ask me
if I wanted to go.

31
00:01:23,357 --> 00:01:25,487
You wanted to go to the
Governor's house for dinner?

32
00:01:25,529 --> 00:01:27,021
Not particularly.

33
00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:29,595
Well, then, what's the problem?

34
00:01:29,638 --> 00:01:32,167
The problem is you never asked
what I wanted.

35
00:01:32,278 --> 00:01:33,747
Odo, you don't eat.

36
00:01:33,782 --> 00:01:37,450
Besides, you hate socializing
with people you don't know.

37
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,961
Well, that's beside the point.

38
00:01:39,997 --> 00:01:43,939
I would have liked to have
been consulted, that's all.

39
00:01:43,973 --> 00:01:45,032
You're right.

40
00:01:45,076 --> 00:01:46,944
Next time we are invited
out for dinner

41
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:50,217
I will make sure you are the one
to say no.

42
00:01:50,254 --> 00:01:51,723
I'd appreciate that.

43
00:01:56,436 --> 00:01:57,564
Hold on.

44
00:01:57,605 --> 00:01:58,869
I'm picking up a wide band

45
00:01:58,908 --> 00:02:01,938
subspace transmission
from a Lissepian supply ship.

46
00:02:01,983 --> 00:02:05,013
They've just been attacked
by a Maquis interceptor.

47
00:02:05,057 --> 00:02:07,791
Long-range sensors
are detecting

48
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,324
a modified Peregrine-class
courier ship

49
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:14,334
lightly armed, one-man crew,
bearing 268 mark 301.

50
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:17,945
The Maquis use
Peregrine-class courier ships.

51
00:02:17,988 --> 00:02:21,622
The Lissepians didn't sustain
any serious damage.

52
00:02:21,663 --> 00:02:23,497
I'm going after him.

53
00:02:23,535 --> 00:02:25,004
Right.

54
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:30,095
I don't know
what the Maquis have done

55
00:04:30,132 --> 00:04:32,000
to that ship's engines,
but it's fast.

56
00:04:32,036 --> 00:04:34,371
Not fast enough.
We're closing on him.

57
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:35,776
We better catch him soon.

58
00:04:35,813 --> 00:04:37,407
We're entering the Badlands.

59
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,512
Wait a minute, I've lost him.

60
00:04:39,555 --> 00:04:43,257
The Badlands' plasma fields
are disrupting our sensors.

61
00:04:43,297 --> 00:04:44,766
Increase the sensor bandwidth.

62
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,237
It should compensate
for the interference.

63
00:04:47,273 --> 00:04:48,241
I hope you're right.

64
00:04:48,275 --> 00:04:49,710
Well, he can't
have gotten far.

65
00:04:49,746 --> 00:04:52,583
He's got to be somewhere
in this solar system.

66
00:04:52,619 --> 00:04:53,587
There he is.

67
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:55,284
Looks like
he's trying to land

68
00:04:55,326 --> 00:04:58,128
on one of the moons
orbiting that gas giant.

69
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,635
I'm following him in.

70
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:01,070
There's something wrong
with his ship.

71
00:05:01,106 --> 00:05:04,204
It looks like his attitude
stabilizers have failed.

72
00:05:04,247 --> 00:05:05,580
Can you get
a transporter lock on him?

73
00:05:05,617 --> 00:05:07,086
Too much interference.

74
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,786
He's trying to land
on that moon.

75
00:05:12,132 --> 00:05:13,863
Ah, we've lost him.

76
00:05:13,937 --> 00:05:15,406
Did he make it?

77
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:16,808
I don't know.

78
00:05:16,844 --> 00:05:18,872
Something in
the moon's atmosphere

79
00:05:18,982 --> 00:05:20,611
is jamming our sensors.

80
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:24,823
Then I guess we'll have to land
and see for ourselves.

81
00:05:28,973 --> 00:05:30,910
O'Brien to Sisko.

82
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:32,708
Go ahead.

83
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:35,242
Commander, there's
someone here to see you.

84
00:05:35,288 --> 00:05:36,587
Who is it?

85
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:37,753
It's Nog.

86
00:05:37,794 --> 00:05:39,161
Nog?

87
00:05:39,197 --> 00:05:40,791
Tell him it's urgent.

88
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:43,170
He says it's urgent.

89
00:05:43,207 --> 00:05:45,269
Send him in.

90
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:48,149
I told you he'd see me.

91
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:57,974
Commander...

92
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,676
first, let me express
my most sincere thanks

93
00:06:00,715 --> 00:06:03,152
for allowing me
to speak with you.

94
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,921
You're welcome.

95
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:08,398
Now... what is this
all about?

96
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:12,604
I wanted to give you... this.

97
00:06:14,114 --> 00:06:15,242
Open it.

98
00:06:22,568 --> 00:06:23,969
What's this?

99
00:06:24,072 --> 00:06:25,701
It's latinum.

100
00:06:25,742 --> 00:06:29,080
I know it's latinum, but why
are you giving it to me?

101
00:06:29,117 --> 00:06:33,321
Yesterday, I completed
the Ferengi Attainment Ceremony.

102
00:06:33,361 --> 00:06:34,990
I'm an adult.

103
00:06:35,064 --> 00:06:36,328
Congratulations.

104
00:06:36,368 --> 00:06:37,358
Thank you.

105
00:06:37,404 --> 00:06:38,703
But...

106
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,437
that doesn't explain this.

107
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:42,381
According to Ferengi Bylaws

108
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:45,686
section 105, subparagraph ten,
upon reaching adulthood

109
00:06:45,723 --> 00:06:48,525
Ferengi males must purchase
an apprenticeship

110
00:06:48,563 --> 00:06:51,034
from a suitable role model.

111
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,007
I choose you.

112
00:06:55,647 --> 00:06:57,743
You want to be my apprentice?

113
00:06:57,786 --> 00:06:59,255
That's right.

114
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:02,421
I want to be the first Ferengi
in Starfleet.

115
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:05,734
Now, who do I see
about getting a uniform?

116
00:07:05,771 --> 00:07:08,801
Nog, if you want to become
a Starfleet officer

117
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:11,249
you have to attend the Academy.

118
00:07:11,285 --> 00:07:13,016
All right.

119
00:07:13,123 --> 00:07:14,820
Where do I sign up?

120
00:07:16,965 --> 00:07:18,730
It's not that simple.

121
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:20,899
As a non-Federation citizen

122
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:24,940
you need a letter of reference
from a command-level officer

123
00:07:24,984 --> 00:07:28,048
before you can even take
the entrance exam.

124
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:30,791
A command-level officer...

125
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:32,528
you mean, like you.

126
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:36,875
Well, yes... like me.

127
00:07:36,913 --> 00:07:38,644
Then you'll write the letter.

128
00:07:38,683 --> 00:07:40,654
I'll think about it.

129
00:07:40,688 --> 00:07:42,089
Thank you, Commander.

130
00:07:42,192 --> 00:07:44,686
I know you'll make
the right decision.

131
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,379
Aren't you forgetting something?

132
00:07:55,056 --> 00:07:56,685
Keep it.

133
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,061
Consider it a token
of my appreciation.

134
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,900
Tricorders are useless.

135
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:18,605
The atmospheric ionization
is jamming their transponders.

136
00:08:18,646 --> 00:08:19,876
Are you sure
he's in these caverns?

137
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,476
Well, he wasn't
in the wreckage of his ship

138
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:23,250
and given the weather
conditions on the surface

139
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,920
there's no way anyone
could survive out there

140
00:08:24,961 --> 00:08:26,157
for very long,
so that leaves...

141
00:08:28,168 --> 00:08:30,264
That's the third quake
since we got here.

142
00:08:30,307 --> 00:08:32,004
This moon must be
seismically unstable.

143
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:34,482
The sooner we find our fugitive,
the better off we'll be.

144
00:08:34,517 --> 00:08:36,146
Well, finding him
isn't going to be easy.

145
00:08:36,255 --> 00:08:37,656
These caverns
could go on forever.

146
00:08:37,692 --> 00:08:38,991
And with all this
seismic activity

147
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:41,262
I don't want to stay here
any longer than we have to.

148
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:42,269
I say we split up.

149
00:08:42,303 --> 00:08:43,567
We meet back here in 20 minutes

150
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,839
and if we haven't
found him by then

151
00:08:45,878 --> 00:08:47,040
we may have to leave
without him.

152
00:08:47,081 --> 00:08:48,414
If he's smart,
he'll let us find him.

153
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:49,943
Federation prison
would be paradise

154
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,013
compared to this place.

155
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:52,047
Well, let's hope he's smart.

156
00:08:52,093 --> 00:08:53,722
I'll see you in 20 minutes.

157
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,872
Kira to Odo.
Odo, can you hear me?

158
00:09:00,914 --> 00:09:02,315
This is Odo.
I can barely hear you.

159
00:09:02,351 --> 00:09:04,082
Odo, I'm trapped.
I need your help.

160
00:09:04,122 --> 00:09:05,819
Come quickly.
Odo, do you read me?

161
00:09:05,859 --> 00:09:08,353
Stay where you are, Major.
I'm on my way.

162
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,426
Odo, is that you?

163
00:09:21,463 --> 00:09:23,194
I'm right here, Major.

164
00:09:23,234 --> 00:09:25,432
Odo, I'm glad to see you.

165
00:09:27,244 --> 00:09:28,713
What's wrong?

166
00:09:28,747 --> 00:09:30,581
You're not going to believe
this... my foot is stuck.

167
00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:31,918
Stuck? How?

168
00:09:31,955 --> 00:09:33,219
I don't know.

169
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,228
I must have stepped
in a fissure or something.

170
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:36,798
I can't get it loose.

171
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,325
Let me take a look.

172
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,554
It's not a fissure.

173
00:09:45,588 --> 00:09:46,955
Then what is it?

174
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:51,161
Your foot's been encased
in some kind of crystal.

175
00:09:51,202 --> 00:09:54,506
And from the look of things...

176
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:56,638
the crystal is spreading.

177
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,038
Now, you're sure
you can't pull it loose?

178
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:09,305
Oh, believe me, I've tried.

179
00:10:09,378 --> 00:10:11,645
Maybe if you
slip your foot out of your boot?

180
00:10:11,683 --> 00:10:12,913
I can barely feel

181
00:10:12,953 --> 00:10:15,288
my foot, the crystal is
pressing against it so hard.

182
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:17,022
There's no way
I can get my boot off.

183
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,392
Hold on a minute.

184
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:26,016
This might hurt a bit.

185
00:10:26,051 --> 00:10:27,384
Go ahead.

186
00:10:39,784 --> 00:10:42,586
I fail to see the humor
in this situation.

187
00:10:42,624 --> 00:10:44,093
Come on, Odo.

188
00:10:44,128 --> 00:10:46,622
It's pretty ridiculous,
don't you think

189
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:50,039
the two of us being outsmarted
by a chunk of crystal?

190
00:10:50,076 --> 00:10:51,739
Well, I'm not giving up
just yet.

191
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:52,610
Neither am I.

192
00:10:52,648 --> 00:10:55,280
Hand me my phaser.

193
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,554
You sure this is a good idea?

194
00:10:57,593 --> 00:10:59,085
If you're not careful...

195
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,793
I may blow off my foot
and give Julian

196
00:11:00,835 --> 00:11:03,033
the chance to prove
what a wonderful doctor he is?

197
00:11:03,073 --> 00:11:05,135
Don't worry, I have
no intention of giving him

198
00:11:05,178 --> 00:11:06,146
the opportunity.

199
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,170
Stand back.

200
00:11:15,637 --> 00:11:19,271
I guess that wasn't
such a good idea after all.

201
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:20,942
The crystal formation

202
00:11:20,983 --> 00:11:23,854
seems to have somehow
fed off the energy

203
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,484
from your phaser.

204
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:31,307
Odo to <i>Mekong.</i>

205
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:33,313
Two to beam out.
Energize.

206
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,754
Odo to <i>Mekong.</i>

207
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:42,094
I can't contact the runabout.

208
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,968
There's too much interference.

209
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:46,568
I'll have to walk back
to the landing site

210
00:11:46,611 --> 00:11:48,844
and try to transport
you from there.

211
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,390
Are you worried
about leaving me here?

212
00:11:58,038 --> 00:12:01,102
Now that you mention it, yes.

213
00:12:01,146 --> 00:12:03,140
I'll be fine, Odo.

214
00:12:03,184 --> 00:12:06,784
I promise not to go anywhere.

215
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:24,799
Nog, hand me that
phase matrix recalibrator.

216
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,644
Here you are, Father.

217
00:12:26,682 --> 00:12:28,117
Is it fixed yet?

218
00:12:28,185 --> 00:12:29,654
Not yet, Brother.

219
00:12:29,689 --> 00:12:30,657
What's taking so long?

220
00:12:30,691 --> 00:12:32,320
We're working as fast as we can.

221
00:12:32,362 --> 00:12:34,458
The replicators'
entire power supply grid

222
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:35,629
has been shorted out.

223
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:38,004
I told you, Brother,
if you don't shut down

224
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:40,513
your replicators at least once
a week for routine maintenance

225
00:12:40,548 --> 00:12:42,416
you risk system overloads
like this one.

226
00:12:42,453 --> 00:12:44,481
You said it might
overload the system, might.

227
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:46,051
He tried to warn you,
Uncle Quark.

228
00:12:46,095 --> 00:12:48,157
You should have listened to him.

229
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:49,759
No, it's my fault.

230
00:12:49,804 --> 00:12:51,968
I should have
explained it better.

231
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:53,137
Of course it's your fault.

232
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:55,708
Everything that goes wrong
here is your fault.

233
00:12:55,752 --> 00:12:58,657
It says so in your contract.

234
00:12:58,692 --> 00:13:01,722
Now, this mess had better be
cleaned up before lunchtime

235
00:13:01,766 --> 00:13:04,135
or I'm taking the losses
out of your pay.

236
00:13:04,205 --> 00:13:06,699
Of course, Brother.

237
00:13:08,716 --> 00:13:11,518
Um... I need to get
a replacement power coupling

238
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:13,150
from the storage room.

239
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:14,890
I'll be right back.

240
00:13:23,417 --> 00:13:25,182
Hey, Nog, what's going on?

241
00:13:25,256 --> 00:13:27,284
If you're here to order lunch

242
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:29,560
you'll have to come
back in an hour.

243
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:31,193
Actually, I just ate.

244
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,329
Hey, that was
a pretty funny joke

245
00:13:32,373 --> 00:13:33,501
you pulled on my dad
this morning.

246
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:34,772
What?

247
00:13:34,811 --> 00:13:36,542
You know... about wanting
to join Starfleet.

248
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,847
I wasn't joking.

249
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:39,115
Come on, Nog.

250
00:13:39,155 --> 00:13:41,558
You don't really expect me
to fall for that one.

251
00:13:41,595 --> 00:13:44,591
Did you tell your
father I was joking?

252
00:13:44,635 --> 00:13:46,469
Yeah. Kind of.

253
00:13:46,506 --> 00:13:48,135
How could you do that to me?

254
00:13:48,177 --> 00:13:49,806
I want you
to go back to your father

255
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:51,146
and tell him
that you were wrong.

256
00:13:51,184 --> 00:13:52,676
All right, calm down.

257
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:55,489
I mean, how was I supposed
to know you were serious?

258
00:13:55,528 --> 00:13:58,558
You never said you wanted
to join Starfleet before.

259
00:13:58,602 --> 00:14:00,231
I'm saying it now.

260
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,038
So what brought this on?

261
00:14:02,077 --> 00:14:04,571
I have my reasons.

262
00:14:04,617 --> 00:14:06,417
Okay, name one.

263
00:14:06,454 --> 00:14:07,753
Why should I?

264
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,986
Because I'm your friend

265
00:14:09,027 --> 00:14:10,861
and friends don't keep secrets
from one another.

266
00:14:10,898 --> 00:14:12,663
It's not a secret.

267
00:14:12,702 --> 00:14:15,402
I just don't feel
like talking about it.

268
00:14:15,442 --> 00:14:16,741
Why?

269
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:18,647
Because it's personal.

270
00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:22,154
Now, stop asking me.

271
00:14:22,191 --> 00:14:25,255
All right, but my father's
a pretty smart guy

272
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,702
and if this is
some kind of trick

273
00:14:27,738 --> 00:14:29,800
he's going to figure it out.

274
00:14:29,843 --> 00:14:32,110
There's nothing to figure out.

275
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:34,713
I'm joining Starfleet,
and that's that.

276
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,896
Now, if you don't mind,
I have a lot of work to do.

277
00:15:05,462 --> 00:15:08,492
Computer, lock onto
these coordinates

278
00:15:08,536 --> 00:15:11,202
and initiate transport sequence.

279
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,441
Unable to comply.

280
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:14,780
Explain.

281
00:15:14,818 --> 00:15:17,723
The high level of
atmospheric ionization

282
00:15:17,758 --> 00:15:20,093
is inhibiting transporter lock.

283
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,126
Can you compensate
for the interference

284
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,268
by using pattern enhancers?

285
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,745
Negative.

286
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,013
Pattern enhancers
will not function

287
00:15:29,052 --> 00:15:31,114
in a polarized ionization field.

288
00:15:31,157 --> 00:15:34,096
Is there any way to achieve
a transporter lock

289
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:36,227
in this kind
of ionization field?

290
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,568
Negative.

291
00:15:40,947 --> 00:15:45,583
Computer, send out
a priority one distress signal

292
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,390
to Deep Space 9.

293
00:15:47,496 --> 00:15:48,624
Unable to comply.

294
00:15:48,665 --> 00:15:51,263
Communication systems
are inoperable

295
00:15:51,305 --> 00:15:53,708
due to atmospheric interference.

296
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,808
In that case,
launch a communications probe

297
00:15:56,852 --> 00:15:58,549
and instruct it to begin

298
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:01,528
a continuous broadcast
of our whereabouts

299
00:16:01,563 --> 00:16:04,034
as soon as it clears
the atmosphere.

300
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:05,595
Working.

301
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,742
Probe launch confirmed.

302
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,319
Computer, given ideal conditions

303
00:16:15,363 --> 00:16:19,396
how soon can we expect help
from Deep Space 9?

304
00:16:19,506 --> 00:16:23,345
Deep Space 9 should receive
the probe's distress signal

305
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,113
in approximately two days.

306
00:16:44,366 --> 00:16:46,200
Kira!
I heard phaser fire.

307
00:16:46,237 --> 00:16:47,296
You just missed our friend.

308
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,467
He came out of that tunnel.

309
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:50,844
I think he was
as surprised as I was.

310
00:16:50,881 --> 00:16:52,350
He fired at me from over there

311
00:16:52,385 --> 00:16:54,949
and when I shot back,
he ran off down the tunnel.

312
00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:57,363
Don't worry.

313
00:16:57,397 --> 00:17:00,427
His aim wasn't any better
than mine was.

314
00:17:00,471 --> 00:17:03,444
He didn't miss by much.

315
00:17:03,545 --> 00:17:05,573
My lucky day.

316
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,790
I see you've put in
a request to reassign

317
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,633
Ensign Vilix'pran
from cargo inspection.

318
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:20,867
I think that would be best.

319
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:22,536
Given his condition,
I don't want him

320
00:17:22,578 --> 00:17:24,708
coming into contact
with any hazardous materials.

321
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,912
His condition?

322
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:27,648
Vilix'pran is budding.

323
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,593
His buds are undergoing
individuation

324
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:30,722
in just over a month.

325
00:17:30,764 --> 00:17:32,063
You mean, he's pregnant.

326
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:33,400
Twins.

327
00:17:33,438 --> 00:17:34,873
Ah. Reassignment granted.

328
00:17:34,908 --> 00:17:37,608
I'll have to make sure
I offer my congratulations

329
00:17:37,648 --> 00:17:39,277
to the Ensign
the next time I see him.

330
00:17:39,318 --> 00:17:40,810
Well, O'Brien and I
are throwing him

331
00:17:40,855 --> 00:17:42,290
a baby shower
in a couple of days.

332
00:17:42,325 --> 00:17:44,626
I think it would mean a lot
to him if you were there.

333
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,464
Are you getting him anything?

334
00:17:46,502 --> 00:17:48,973
O'Brien's building him
a hatchling pond

335
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:50,443
and I've put an order
in with Garak

336
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:51,538
for some new baby clothes.

337
00:17:51,581 --> 00:17:52,709
Count me in.

338
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,718
Aye, sir.

339
00:17:53,752 --> 00:17:54,948
Ensign Pran... hmm.

340
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,836
Commander Sisko, have
you made up your mind yet

341
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,344
about my letter?

342
00:18:04,378 --> 00:18:05,847
Not exactly.

343
00:18:05,882 --> 00:18:08,285
What does that mean,
"not exactly"?

344
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:10,815
Look, Nog, I have
to be honest with you.

345
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,924
When I think of candidates
for Starfleet Academy

346
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,370
yours is not the first name
that comes to mind.

347
00:18:16,407 --> 00:18:18,401
Why not?
Because I'm a Ferengi?

348
00:18:18,445 --> 00:18:20,074
Not at all.

349
00:18:20,116 --> 00:18:22,349
The fact is, your reputation
on this station

350
00:18:22,388 --> 00:18:23,823
leaves a lot to be desired.

351
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:26,387
Your school grades
are mediocre at best

352
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,698
and you've had more
than a few run-ins

353
00:18:28,736 --> 00:18:30,171
with Constable Odo.

354
00:18:30,207 --> 00:18:32,201
Okay, okay, so I've
made some mistakes.

355
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,714
I admit that.

356
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:35,377
But I could do better.

357
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:37,116
Just give me a chance.

358
00:18:42,169 --> 00:18:44,299
You wanted to see me, Benjamin?

359
00:18:44,341 --> 00:18:46,038
Lieutenant, I need
a complete inventory

360
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:48,207
of the contents of Cargo Bay 12.

361
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,187
Didn't we inventory
12 last week?

362
00:18:50,221 --> 00:18:51,554
I'd like it done again.

363
00:18:51,591 --> 00:18:53,528
All right, I'll assign
a crew to it immediately.

364
00:18:53,563 --> 00:18:56,935
Actually, I already have
someone in mind for the job.

365
00:18:56,971 --> 00:18:58,839
Really? Who?

366
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:01,973
- Nog.
- Nog.

367
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:04,717
He's asked for a recommendation
to Starfleet Academy.

368
00:19:04,756 --> 00:19:06,157
Nog?

369
00:19:06,192 --> 00:19:08,186
My reaction exactly.

370
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:11,170
I always thought
it would be interesting

371
00:19:11,204 --> 00:19:14,336
to have a Ferengi
in Starfleet... but Nog?

372
00:19:14,379 --> 00:19:15,973
I know it seems unlikely

373
00:19:16,016 --> 00:19:17,781
but before I make up my mind

374
00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:20,292
I want to give him
a chance to prove himself.

375
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:23,528
Commander, there's
a lot of valuable equipment

376
00:19:23,568 --> 00:19:25,037
in Cargo Bay 12.

377
00:19:25,072 --> 00:19:26,371
I know.

378
00:19:26,408 --> 00:19:27,934
Maybe I should assign

379
00:19:27,978 --> 00:19:30,472
a couple of crew members
to assist him.

380
00:19:30,517 --> 00:19:32,988
No, I want him to do it alone...

381
00:19:33,024 --> 00:19:35,018
no help, no interference

382
00:19:35,062 --> 00:19:37,762
no one looking
over his shoulder.

383
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:46,117
I wish I could
analyze this material.

384
00:19:46,188 --> 00:19:48,625
Too bad our tricorders
don't work.

385
00:19:48,661 --> 00:19:51,566
Or our communicators
or the transporter.

386
00:19:51,602 --> 00:19:53,971
Our fugitive
couldn't have chosen

387
00:19:54,007 --> 00:19:55,704
a better place to hide.

388
00:19:55,745 --> 00:19:58,547
Very convenient,
don't you think?

389
00:19:58,585 --> 00:20:01,821
You make it sound like
he planned on trapping us.

390
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:04,730
Well, maybe he did,
but it's not going to work.

391
00:20:04,766 --> 00:20:06,258
I'm going to get you
out of here.

392
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,406
How long do you think
I have, Odo?

393
00:20:10,447 --> 00:20:11,882
Long enough.

394
00:20:11,917 --> 00:20:15,790
I figure at the rate
the crystal's been growing...

395
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:18,459
I'm going to be
completely covered

396
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,698
in less than 12 hours.

397
00:20:23,144 --> 00:20:25,615
Unless this cave
collapses first.

398
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,680
There has got to be a way
to shatter this crystal!

399
00:20:28,724 --> 00:20:30,216
I'm sure there is,
but that doesn't mean

400
00:20:30,328 --> 00:20:32,162
we're going to find it
in less than 12 hours!

401
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:33,691
We'll find it.

402
00:20:40,987 --> 00:20:42,787
Major...

403
00:20:44,227 --> 00:20:47,257
do you ever look
at the criminal activity reports

404
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:49,340
we get
from Starfleet Security?

405
00:20:50,744 --> 00:20:52,213
Not often.

406
00:20:52,247 --> 00:20:53,716
Well, you should.

407
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:55,745
They make fascinating reading.

408
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:58,090
A few months ago,
we got a report

409
00:20:58,128 --> 00:21:00,156
on a theft on Remmil VI.

410
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:03,172
It seems the natives
there spin a kind

411
00:21:03,206 --> 00:21:04,903
of crystalline webbing
that they use

412
00:21:04,944 --> 00:21:06,243
to construct their buildings.

413
00:21:06,347 --> 00:21:10,220
A band of Nausicaan raiders
broke into their Central Museum

414
00:21:10,257 --> 00:21:13,561
by using a high-frequency
ultrasonic generator

415
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,404
to create a sympathetic
vibration inside the webbing

416
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:18,910
and shatter it.

417
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:19,912
So all we need to do

418
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,677
is find a band
of Nausicaan raiders

419
00:21:21,718 --> 00:21:23,278
and ask them to give us a hand?

420
00:21:23,321 --> 00:21:27,889
No, I might be able to put
together a makeshift generator

421
00:21:27,933 --> 00:21:31,738
using the covariant oscillator
on the runabout.

422
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:33,108
Ah, the trick will be

423
00:21:33,145 --> 00:21:35,548
finding the right
frequency to create

424
00:21:35,584 --> 00:21:38,318
a sympathetic vibration
inside this crystal.

425
00:21:38,357 --> 00:21:40,487
I'm going to have
to go back to the runabout

426
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:42,021
start assembling the generator.

427
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:45,472
Keep your phaser handy in case
our friend decides to come back.

428
00:21:45,508 --> 00:21:46,772
I will.

429
00:21:46,811 --> 00:21:49,112
I'll be back as soon as I can.

430
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,619
Constable...

431
00:21:50,653 --> 00:21:52,624
when we get back to the station

432
00:21:52,658 --> 00:21:56,292
I'm going to start reading
those criminal activity reports.

433
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,201
I'll make sure you get them.

434
00:22:06,357 --> 00:22:07,951
Due to a computer error

435
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:10,729
we lost the manifest
on this entire cargo bay.

436
00:22:10,768 --> 00:22:14,470
Commander Sisko would like you
to re-inventory its contents.

437
00:22:14,511 --> 00:22:15,673
The entire cargo bay?

438
00:22:15,713 --> 00:22:16,681
That's right.

439
00:22:16,716 --> 00:22:18,049
By myself?

440
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:23,589
Look, Nog, Starfleet isn't just
about diplomacy, exploration.

441
00:22:23,632 --> 00:22:27,266
A lot of the time,
it's just hard work.

442
00:22:27,308 --> 00:22:29,974
When does Commander
Sisko want it done?

443
00:22:30,014 --> 00:22:32,612
He would like
the manifest on his desk

444
00:22:32,654 --> 00:22:34,488
first thing in the morning.

445
00:22:34,526 --> 00:22:37,363
He'll have it tonight
before he goes off duty.

446
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:39,632
Tomorrow morning
will be fine, Nog.

447
00:22:39,671 --> 00:22:41,835
Now, if you don't mind,
Lieutenant

448
00:22:41,876 --> 00:22:43,744
I'd like to get started.

449
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,804
How long do you think
it's going to be

450
00:22:55,843 --> 00:22:58,816
before the generator
finds the right frequency?

451
00:23:00,654 --> 00:23:02,385
It's hard to say.

452
00:23:03,628 --> 00:23:05,622
It could take hours.

453
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:10,975
I don't suppose there's
any way to speed things up.

454
00:23:12,984 --> 00:23:14,749
I didn't think so.

455
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,263
Don't worry, Major.

456
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:22,671
I have every intention of
getting us back to the station

457
00:23:22,707 --> 00:23:24,199
by tomorrow night.

458
00:23:25,214 --> 00:23:27,447
Chief O'Brien is counting on it.

459
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:29,513
What does O'Brien
have to do with it?

460
00:23:31,228 --> 00:23:34,258
We... have an appointment.

461
00:23:34,302 --> 00:23:36,067
What kind of appointment?

462
00:23:39,113 --> 00:23:41,141
Talk to me, Odo.

463
00:23:41,185 --> 00:23:43,247
It helps pass the time.

464
00:23:45,629 --> 00:23:47,326
The, uh, Chief and I

465
00:23:47,367 --> 00:23:50,169
are supposed to go
kayaking together

466
00:23:50,206 --> 00:23:51,675
in a holosuite.

467
00:23:51,711 --> 00:23:53,909
You're kidding.

468
00:23:53,949 --> 00:23:56,979
How did he talk you
into that one?

469
00:23:57,023 --> 00:24:00,623
He didn't "talk me"
into anything.

470
00:24:00,665 --> 00:24:02,863
It's really quite enjoyable.

471
00:24:02,903 --> 00:24:04,395
You mean, you've done it before?

472
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,373
Twice.

473
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,438
He invited me one evening

474
00:24:07,482 --> 00:24:10,683
and seeing I had no plans,
I accepted.

475
00:24:10,722 --> 00:24:13,091
I'm sorry.
I'm just having trouble

476
00:24:13,129 --> 00:24:16,261
imagining the two of you
together in a boat.

477
00:24:16,302 --> 00:24:17,771
Well, if it helps any

478
00:24:17,806 --> 00:24:19,674
he's the one
who does all the singing.

479
00:24:19,711 --> 00:24:21,078
He sings?

480
00:24:21,114 --> 00:24:22,982
He says it's necessary

481
00:24:23,018 --> 00:24:26,254
to establish
a smooth paddling rhythm.

482
00:24:26,293 --> 00:24:28,230
This gets better and better.

483
00:24:28,265 --> 00:24:29,529
What kinds of songs
does he sing?

484
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:32,472
Ancient human sea chanteys,
mostly.

485
00:24:32,508 --> 00:24:36,883
He's particularly fond
of one called "Louie, Louie."

486
00:24:39,524 --> 00:24:45,493
I never pictured O'Brien
as the nautical type.

487
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:47,703
Next to his work and his family

488
00:24:47,744 --> 00:24:51,014
shooting the rapids
is his favorite activity.

489
00:24:51,053 --> 00:24:55,325
He's had the holo-program
since he was on the <i>Enterprise.</i>

490
00:24:55,363 --> 00:24:58,860
How long do these
boat trips usually take?

491
00:24:58,905 --> 00:25:00,808
That depends.

492
00:25:00,842 --> 00:25:02,607
On what?

493
00:25:02,647 --> 00:25:05,814
On how many times we capsize.

494
00:25:05,854 --> 00:25:08,554
It must be
a very difficult program.

495
00:25:08,594 --> 00:25:11,431
It's extremely difficult.

496
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,498
According to him,
he's dislocated his shoulder

497
00:25:14,542 --> 00:25:18,142
half a dozen times trying
to make it down those rapids.

498
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:20,587
Then why does he keep doing it?

499
00:25:20,623 --> 00:25:22,058
Because he loves it.

500
00:25:22,093 --> 00:25:24,030
And it's been my observation

501
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:26,536
that you humanoids
have a hard time

502
00:25:26,571 --> 00:25:28,599
giving up the things you love

503
00:25:28,642 --> 00:25:31,410
no matter how much
they might hurt you.

504
00:25:31,449 --> 00:25:34,513
I'm glad you're here, Odo.

505
00:25:34,556 --> 00:25:37,154
I'm glad I'm here, too.

506
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,332
Odo!

507
00:25:58,818 --> 00:26:00,014
- Major...
- I'm all right.

508
00:26:00,055 --> 00:26:02,424
What about the generator?

509
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,428
It's fine.

510
00:26:03,463 --> 00:26:05,730
It still hasn't found
the right frequency

511
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:07,068
to shatter the crystal.

512
00:26:07,105 --> 00:26:08,073
Tell it to hurry.

513
00:26:08,107 --> 00:26:10,044
A couple more tremors
like that last one

514
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:12,107
and this whole cave is
going to collapse.

515
00:26:12,151 --> 00:26:13,313
Well, we'll just
have to make sure

516
00:26:13,354 --> 00:26:14,322
that doesn't happen.

517
00:26:14,356 --> 00:26:16,725
After all, we've been
in worse situations

518
00:26:16,761 --> 00:26:18,857
than this one
and come out all right.

519
00:26:18,933 --> 00:26:20,961
Name three.

520
00:26:23,511 --> 00:26:26,005
I can't think of any, either.

521
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,887
No, it... it's not that.

522
00:26:28,991 --> 00:26:31,485
It's just that...

523
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,899
that wasn't
the response I expected.

524
00:26:33,936 --> 00:26:36,500
What do you mean?

525
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:40,108
In the detective novels
Chief O'Brien gives me to read

526
00:26:40,151 --> 00:26:41,552
when the hero says

527
00:26:41,588 --> 00:26:44,720
"we've been in tougher
situations than this one"

528
00:26:44,763 --> 00:26:48,226
his friends always agree.

529
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,673
I never read any of those books.

530
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:55,816
Well, there must be
some humanoid platitude

531
00:26:55,855 --> 00:26:57,826
I can use to cheer you up.

532
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:02,166
I don't have
much use for platitudes, Odo.

533
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,768
I'd rather face the truth
of a situation

534
00:27:04,811 --> 00:27:06,907
and go on from there.

535
00:27:06,949 --> 00:27:08,920
I feel the same way.

536
00:27:08,953 --> 00:27:10,354
I know you do.

537
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:12,861
That's why you and I
get along so well.

538
00:27:12,896 --> 00:27:15,390
I suppose it is.

539
00:27:15,435 --> 00:27:17,906
But, in this case, the truth is

540
00:27:17,942 --> 00:27:21,405
we're going to get
you out of here, Major

541
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,387
and that's no platitude.

542
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:27,725
I must admit,
this is impressive work.

543
00:27:27,765 --> 00:27:29,394
Incredible is more like it.

544
00:27:29,436 --> 00:27:31,407
He inventoried
the whole cargo bay

545
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,876
in under five hours.

546
00:27:32,911 --> 00:27:34,574
You're sure
he didn't have any help?

547
00:27:34,615 --> 00:27:36,643
According
to the internal sensors

548
00:27:36,686 --> 00:27:38,816
no one else entered
that cargo bay

549
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:40,658
the entire time he was there.

550
00:27:40,696 --> 00:27:42,826
I guess he did learn something

551
00:27:42,868 --> 00:27:45,237
working
in his uncle's storeroom.

552
00:27:45,274 --> 00:27:47,711
I assume
that all of our equipment

553
00:27:47,747 --> 00:27:49,809
is where it's supposed to be?

554
00:27:49,852 --> 00:27:52,153
If you're asking
if he stole anything

555
00:27:52,191 --> 00:27:53,592
the answer is no.

556
00:27:53,627 --> 00:27:55,723
He even found some
things we missed

557
00:27:55,766 --> 00:27:57,600
on our last inventory.

558
00:27:57,636 --> 00:28:00,039
Okay. So now we know
he's a hard worker.

559
00:28:00,109 --> 00:28:01,601
The question remains

560
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:05,451
why does he want
to join Starfleet?

561
00:28:05,488 --> 00:28:07,755
I have no idea.

562
00:28:07,795 --> 00:28:09,389
I don't understand it.

563
00:28:09,432 --> 00:28:12,736
I've run through
the entire harmonic spectrum

564
00:28:12,773 --> 00:28:14,710
and none of the frequencies

565
00:28:14,744 --> 00:28:17,113
have had any effect
on the crystal.

566
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,619
It's almost as if

567
00:28:18,654 --> 00:28:21,286
the structure of the crystal
is mutating

568
00:28:21,327 --> 00:28:24,528
to keep us from finding
the right frequency.

569
00:28:24,568 --> 00:28:26,471
Odo?

570
00:28:26,506 --> 00:28:28,704
Yes, Major?

571
00:28:32,587 --> 00:28:36,221
Oh, I wish there was
something else I could do.

572
00:28:36,262 --> 00:28:39,258
Just keep talking to me.

573
00:28:42,444 --> 00:28:44,438
What do you want me to say?

574
00:28:44,482 --> 00:28:46,453
Anything.
Tell me a story.

575
00:28:46,487 --> 00:28:49,358
A story?

576
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,886
I know.

577
00:28:50,931 --> 00:28:53,095
Tell me how you got your name.

578
00:28:53,203 --> 00:28:55,299
My name?

579
00:28:55,342 --> 00:28:56,971
Ah...

580
00:28:57,012 --> 00:29:00,110
now that you mention it,
that is an amusing story.

581
00:29:00,153 --> 00:29:01,850
Tell it to me.

582
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,986
Well...

583
00:29:04,931 --> 00:29:07,927
as you know, when Dr. Mora

584
00:29:07,972 --> 00:29:10,000
first brought me
to his laboratory

585
00:29:10,044 --> 00:29:12,242
it was under
Cardassian supervision.

586
00:29:12,282 --> 00:29:16,281
All specimens had to be
clearly labeled in Cardassian

587
00:29:16,325 --> 00:29:18,592
so the Overseers
would always know

588
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:23,405
what the scientists
were working on.

589
00:29:23,442 --> 00:29:27,714
Since no one was
exactly sure what I was

590
00:29:27,752 --> 00:29:31,625
Mora labeled me
"unknown sample"

591
00:29:31,662 --> 00:29:37,404
which the Overseer translated
into Cardassian as <i>odo'ital.</i>

592
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:41,316
So your name
is "unknown sample"?

593
00:29:41,351 --> 00:29:43,288
No... no.

594
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:49,099
<i>Odo'ital</i> literally means
the word "nothing."

595
00:29:49,137 --> 00:29:52,942
Even after it became
clear that I was sentient

596
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:56,421
the Bajoran scientists
kept calling me that.

597
00:29:56,455 --> 00:30:00,659
As a joke, they split
it into two words

598
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:03,968
like a Bajoran name: "Odo Ital."

599
00:30:04,006 --> 00:30:05,475
Which eventually
got shortened...

600
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,740
To Odo.

601
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:07,769
Ah.

602
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,529
But now the thing is,
for the longest time

603
00:30:15,567 --> 00:30:17,834
whenever anyone
would use my name

604
00:30:17,872 --> 00:30:22,110
the first thing I would think of
was what it meant..."Nothing."

605
00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:24,017
What better way to describe me?

606
00:30:24,054 --> 00:30:27,255
I had no family, no friends,
no place where I belonged.

607
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:29,858
I thought it was
the most appropriate name

608
00:30:29,901 --> 00:30:31,564
anyone could give me...

609
00:30:33,243 --> 00:30:35,271
and then I met you...

610
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:42,724
and the others... Sisko, Dax,
even Quark.

611
00:30:42,765 --> 00:30:44,428
And now...

612
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:48,913
when I hear
one of you call me "Odo"

613
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:51,852
I no longer think of myself
as nothing.

614
00:30:51,887 --> 00:30:54,222
I think of myself as me.

615
00:31:06,422 --> 00:31:08,552
I'm sorry, Major.

616
00:31:08,594 --> 00:31:10,895
I guess that story
wasn't as amusing

617
00:31:10,933 --> 00:31:12,801
as I hoped it would be.

618
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:16,300
No, I liked it very much.

619
00:31:19,621 --> 00:31:23,996
The ultrasonic generator
isn't going to work, is it?

620
00:31:26,303 --> 00:31:30,039
No, I'm afraid it's not.

621
00:31:32,985 --> 00:31:35,456
I don't suppose...

622
00:31:35,492 --> 00:31:38,056
you have any other ideas?

623
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,799
I wish I had.

624
00:31:43,846 --> 00:31:45,543
Neither do I.

625
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:48,989
It doesn't make sense.

626
00:31:49,024 --> 00:31:52,260
The ultrasonic generator
should have worked.

627
00:31:52,298 --> 00:31:54,326
Something's not right here.

628
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,398
Odo...

629
00:31:56,475 --> 00:31:59,004
you've done your best.

630
00:31:59,048 --> 00:32:01,281
It's time for you to go.

631
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,619
Go?

632
00:32:02,657 --> 00:32:05,824
This place is going to collapse
any minute.

633
00:32:05,864 --> 00:32:08,666
The Maquis is probably dead
from one of the cave-ins.

634
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:11,039
There's nothing more
you can do for me.

635
00:32:11,077 --> 00:32:13,845
If you're asking me to leave...

636
00:32:13,884 --> 00:32:16,321
As your superior officer

637
00:32:16,356 --> 00:32:19,329
I'm telling you
to take the runabout

638
00:32:19,363 --> 00:32:23,134
and get the hell off this moon.

639
00:32:23,173 --> 00:32:25,235
That's an order.

640
00:32:38,142 --> 00:32:39,976
Odo, why are you
still standing there?

641
00:32:40,013 --> 00:32:41,448
I told you to get out of here.

642
00:32:41,483 --> 00:32:42,782
I'm not leaving.

643
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:46,386
Constable, I gave you
a direct order.

644
00:32:46,428 --> 00:32:48,262
You can order me all you want.

645
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,635
As of now,
I'm resigning my commission.

646
00:32:50,672 --> 00:32:54,306
Odo, if you stay here,
you'll die.

647
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,841
You don't know that
for certain!

648
00:32:58,424 --> 00:33:02,092
And even if it were true,
I'm not going to abandon you.

649
00:33:05,106 --> 00:33:07,407
I want you to get out of here.

650
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:09,075
Don't you understand?

651
00:33:09,116 --> 00:33:10,346
I can't!

652
00:33:10,386 --> 00:33:12,584
You have to.

653
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:14,619
Odo, please.

654
00:33:18,974 --> 00:33:22,471
No, I won't leave you!

655
00:33:22,582 --> 00:33:23,983
Why?!

656
00:33:24,019 --> 00:33:25,648
Because!

657
00:33:28,998 --> 00:33:30,992
Because...

658
00:33:33,007 --> 00:33:35,308
I'm in love with you.

659
00:33:45,202 --> 00:33:46,865
So...

660
00:33:48,811 --> 00:33:50,576
now you know.

661
00:33:51,651 --> 00:33:53,143
Odo...

662
00:33:56,831 --> 00:33:59,668
I'm in love with you, too.

663
00:34:06,187 --> 00:34:08,351
You wanted to see me,
Commander?

664
00:34:10,864 --> 00:34:12,333
Nog...

665
00:34:12,367 --> 00:34:14,999
I've given your request
a lot of thought.

666
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:17,166
I appreciate that, Commander.

667
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:21,001
But I'm afraid I'm going
to have to turn you down.

668
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:22,408
Turn me down?
Why?

669
00:34:22,445 --> 00:34:24,382
Did I do something wrong?

670
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:26,353
It's not anything you did, Nog.

671
00:34:26,388 --> 00:34:29,384
You're just not
Academy material.

672
00:34:29,428 --> 00:34:31,899
Here...

673
00:34:31,935 --> 00:34:33,564
this belongs to you.

674
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:36,134
Commander, can't we
talk about this?

675
00:34:36,178 --> 00:34:37,704
There's nothing to talk about.

676
00:34:37,749 --> 00:34:40,278
We both know you'd never make it
through the Academy.

677
00:34:40,354 --> 00:34:42,848
You couldn't handle the workload
or the discipline.

678
00:34:42,894 --> 00:34:44,865
You wouldn't last two weeks.

679
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:46,027
That's not true.

680
00:34:46,068 --> 00:34:47,298
I'm a hard worker!

681
00:34:47,338 --> 00:34:48,864
I proved that to you!

682
00:34:48,908 --> 00:34:50,002
It doesn't matter.

683
00:34:50,045 --> 00:34:52,779
And I'm not going to put
my reputation on the line

684
00:34:52,818 --> 00:34:54,755
just to satisfy
some whim of yours.

685
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,157
It's not just a whim.

686
00:34:56,193 --> 00:34:58,323
I'm serious
about joining Starfleet.

687
00:34:58,365 --> 00:35:01,236
I don't have time
for this, Nog.

688
00:35:01,272 --> 00:35:03,904
Now, whatever little scheme
you had, you can forget it.

689
00:35:03,944 --> 00:35:05,915
I'm not giving you that letter.

690
00:35:05,949 --> 00:35:08,045
It's not a joke or a scheme.

691
00:35:08,088 --> 00:35:09,956
I want to join Starfleet.

692
00:35:09,992 --> 00:35:14,298
I want it more than anything
I've ever wanted in my life.

693
00:35:15,806 --> 00:35:18,107
You're a Ferengi.

694
00:35:18,145 --> 00:35:21,449
Why would you want
to be in Starfleet?

695
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:23,958
Where's the profit in it?

696
00:35:23,992 --> 00:35:25,792
I don't care about profit!

697
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,858
Then what do you care about?

698
00:35:27,902 --> 00:35:29,132
Come on, Nog, tell me!

699
00:35:29,172 --> 00:35:32,442
Why is it so damned important
that you get into Starfleet?

700
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:34,039
Why are you doing this?

701
00:35:35,386 --> 00:35:38,223
Because I don't want
to end up like my father!

702
00:35:41,401 --> 00:35:44,898
Your... father.

703
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:46,037
That's right.

704
00:35:46,078 --> 00:35:47,547
My father.

705
00:35:50,155 --> 00:35:52,787
He's been chasing profit
his whole life

706
00:35:52,828 --> 00:35:54,799
and what has it gotten him?

707
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:56,393
Nothing.

708
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,532
And you know why?

709
00:35:59,578 --> 00:36:01,845
Because he doesn't have
the lobes.

710
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:06,524
And neither do I.

711
00:36:10,538 --> 00:36:12,805
And "a Ferengi
without profit..."

712
00:36:12,843 --> 00:36:14,814
"...ls no Ferengi at all."

713
00:36:14,848 --> 00:36:17,980
The 18th Rule of Acquisition.

714
00:36:22,065 --> 00:36:26,371
My father
is a mechanical genius.

715
00:36:26,409 --> 00:36:29,906
He could have been
Chief Engineer of a starship

716
00:36:29,951 --> 00:36:32,184
if he'd had the opportunity.

717
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:36,563
But he went into business,
like a good Ferengi.

718
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,340
The only thing is, he's not
a good Ferengi.

719
00:36:41,378 --> 00:36:43,713
Not when it comes
to acquiring profit.

720
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:46,416
So now, all he has to live for

721
00:36:46,457 --> 00:36:50,023
is the slim chance
that someday, somehow

722
00:36:50,066 --> 00:36:54,806
he might be able
to take over my uncle's bar.

723
00:36:54,843 --> 00:36:58,044
Well, I'm not going to make
the same mistake.

724
00:36:58,085 --> 00:37:00,717
I want to do something
with my life...

725
00:37:00,758 --> 00:37:02,284
something worthwhile.

726
00:37:02,328 --> 00:37:04,128
Like joining Starfleet?

727
00:37:04,165 --> 00:37:08,072
I may not have
an instinct for business

728
00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:10,546
but I have my Father's hands

729
00:37:10,581 --> 00:37:13,213
and my Uncle's tenacity.

730
00:37:13,254 --> 00:37:15,657
I know I've got
something to offer.

731
00:37:15,694 --> 00:37:18,964
I just need the chance
to prove it.

732
00:37:26,753 --> 00:37:28,347
All right.

733
00:37:29,961 --> 00:37:32,330
I'll see
that you get that chance.

734
00:37:34,705 --> 00:37:37,405
You're going to recommend me
to Starfleet Academy?!

735
00:37:37,446 --> 00:37:39,940
I'll send the letter the first
thing tomorrow morning.

736
00:37:41,188 --> 00:37:44,320
Commander, I don't
know how to thank you!

737
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,230
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

738
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:47,997
Don't thank me yet.

739
00:37:48,038 --> 00:37:50,772
You still have a lot
of work ahead of you.

740
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:52,440
Don't worry.

741
00:37:52,482 --> 00:37:54,817
You're never going
to regret this.

742
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,560
Odo?

743
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:04,141
Yes, Major?

744
00:38:04,176 --> 00:38:07,377
You haven't said a word
to me in over an hour.

745
00:38:09,523 --> 00:38:12,861
I've just been going over
a few things in my mind.

746
00:38:15,871 --> 00:38:18,342
I'm sorry I waited so long

747
00:38:18,377 --> 00:38:20,644
to tell you
how I feel about you.

748
00:38:23,389 --> 00:38:25,189
If I'd told you earlier

749
00:38:25,227 --> 00:38:28,029
maybe things would
have been different.

750
00:38:28,067 --> 00:38:30,197
Ah.

751
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:33,677
What are you smiling about?

752
00:38:33,714 --> 00:38:37,177
I think I've finally figured out
what's going on here.

753
00:38:37,222 --> 00:38:38,748
This whole situation

754
00:38:38,793 --> 00:38:40,593
hasn't seemed right
since the beginning.

755
00:38:40,697 --> 00:38:43,066
There have been
too many coincidences

756
00:38:43,103 --> 00:38:46,076
too many unanswered questions.

757
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:48,604
Are you still trying
to prove that this is

758
00:38:48,683 --> 00:38:50,984
all some kind of conspiracy?

759
00:38:51,022 --> 00:38:54,086
You said the Maquis was standing
here when he shot at you?

760
00:38:54,129 --> 00:38:55,325
That's right.

761
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,767
How tall was he?
My height?

762
00:38:58,674 --> 00:39:00,645
No...

763
00:39:00,678 --> 00:39:02,147
maybe shorter.

764
00:39:02,181 --> 00:39:04,049
Like this?

765
00:39:04,086 --> 00:39:05,453
More or less.

766
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:07,961
What does it matter, anyway?

767
00:39:07,996 --> 00:39:10,433
It matters
because, from this position

768
00:39:10,468 --> 00:39:12,701
you're blocking
those phaser hits.

769
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:15,372
There's no way
someone standing here

770
00:39:15,414 --> 00:39:17,214
could hit those rocks

771
00:39:17,252 --> 00:39:19,052
without hitting you first.

772
00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:22,119
Maybe he was standing
somewhere else.

773
00:39:22,163 --> 00:39:24,795
Maybe...

774
00:39:24,836 --> 00:39:27,239
or maybe you were lying to me.

775
00:39:27,276 --> 00:39:30,477
Which makes two times
you've lied to me today.

776
00:39:30,516 --> 00:39:32,885
What are you talking about?

777
00:39:32,922 --> 00:39:35,986
You lied when you said
you were shot at by the Maquis

778
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,365
and you lied
when you said you loved me.

779
00:39:38,402 --> 00:39:40,339
But I do love you.

780
00:39:40,373 --> 00:39:43,643
I wish you did, but you don't.

781
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:47,178
Remember, Major, I pride myself
on my ability to observe

782
00:39:47,223 --> 00:39:50,823
human nature, and I've watched
you for the past three years.

783
00:39:50,866 --> 00:39:52,529
In all that time,
I never saw any indication

784
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:55,337
that you had
those kind of feelings for me.

785
00:39:55,376 --> 00:39:57,176
You like me...

786
00:39:57,213 --> 00:39:59,616
you think of me
as a close friend...

787
00:39:59,653 --> 00:40:01,350
but love?

788
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,825
I'm afraid not.

789
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:07,634
Maybe I told you I loved you
because I thought...

790
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:10,304
it would make you feel better.

791
00:40:10,345 --> 00:40:13,581
Because I thought
that's what you wanted to hear.

792
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,783
You're lying again.

793
00:40:16,928 --> 00:40:19,399
The Kira I know

794
00:40:19,433 --> 00:40:22,065
has far too much regard
for our friendship

795
00:40:22,106 --> 00:40:23,507
to lie to me...

796
00:40:23,543 --> 00:40:25,480
even for the best of reasons.

797
00:40:25,515 --> 00:40:27,543
Odo, I can explain.

798
00:40:27,587 --> 00:40:29,421
Good.

799
00:40:29,457 --> 00:40:32,396
And you can start by telling me

800
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:36,237
who you are and what you've done
with Kira.

801
00:40:52,145 --> 00:40:54,139
Well done, Odo.

802
00:40:54,183 --> 00:40:57,156
You really are
quite a skillful investigator.

803
00:40:58,995 --> 00:41:01,797
And you're quite
a skillful changeling.

804
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:04,467
You still have much to learn.

805
00:41:04,508 --> 00:41:08,507
If you want to share your wisdom
tell me where Major Kira is.

806
00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:10,043
Close by.

807
00:41:10,088 --> 00:41:13,061
You were the fugitive
we were chasing, weren't you?

808
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,085
That's correct.

809
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,504
How did you get your hands
on a Maquis ship?

810
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:21,242
Now, Odo, you really
can't expect me

811
00:41:21,282 --> 00:41:23,378
to give you all the answers.

812
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,220
But why lead us here?

813
00:41:25,257 --> 00:41:27,285
Why replace Major Kira?

814
00:41:29,234 --> 00:41:31,603
I needed to understand
why you chose

815
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:36,207
to live with the solids
rather than your own people.

816
00:41:36,251 --> 00:41:39,714
I suspected it had something
to do with Major Kira.

817
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,631
Now, I'm certain of it.

818
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,400
So your plan was
to let me think she died.

819
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,676
You thought that would take away
my link to the solids?

820
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,844
Then you would return to us.

821
00:41:50,886 --> 00:41:54,759
I assure you nothing
will ever make me do that.

822
00:41:54,796 --> 00:41:56,767
I wouldn't be so sure.

823
00:41:56,801 --> 00:41:59,365
Tell me where she is.

824
00:41:59,406 --> 00:42:02,243
And if I don't, then what?
You'll shoot me?

825
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,586
No changeling has
ever harmed another.

826
00:42:08,261 --> 00:42:10,095
There's always a first time.

827
00:42:14,108 --> 00:42:18,346
Major Kira is down that tunnel,
200 meters south of here.

828
00:42:18,385 --> 00:42:21,119
Save her, if it suits you

829
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:23,893
but it won't make
any difference.

830
00:42:23,932 --> 00:42:26,598
She is never going to love you.

831
00:42:26,638 --> 00:42:28,768
How could she?

832
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:31,749
You are a changeling.

833
00:42:51,631 --> 00:42:52,930
Major, wake up!

834
00:42:52,968 --> 00:42:54,733
Odo, what happened?

835
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:56,242
What am I doing here?

836
00:42:56,276 --> 00:42:57,939
It's a long story.

837
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,247
Right now, we have to get
you back to the <i>Mekong.</i>

838
00:43:07,837 --> 00:43:10,867
There's one thing
I still don't understand.

839
00:43:10,911 --> 00:43:14,043
If that Founder
was trying to test

840
00:43:14,086 --> 00:43:18,654
your allegiance to the solids,
why did she impersonate me?

841
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:20,427
I suppose it's because

842
00:43:20,468 --> 00:43:23,373
you happened to be
with me in the runabout.

843
00:43:23,408 --> 00:43:25,436
It could have
just as easily been

844
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,508
Commander Sisko,
Doctor Bashir...

845
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:29,453
What finally made you
realize the truth?

846
00:43:29,489 --> 00:43:31,015
Well, she eventually
made a mistake.

847
00:43:31,059 --> 00:43:33,394
She said something
I know you would never say.

848
00:43:33,432 --> 00:43:34,560
What was that?

849
00:43:34,601 --> 00:43:36,697
Just a slip of the tongue...

850
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,607
nothing important.

851
00:43:39,847 --> 00:43:42,318
I tell you,
I won't stand for it.

852
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:43,822
No nephew of mine

853
00:43:43,856 --> 00:43:46,454
is going to disgrace
our family name

854
00:43:46,496 --> 00:43:48,990
by joining Starfleet.

855
00:43:49,036 --> 00:43:50,733
But, Uncle Quark...

856
00:43:50,773 --> 00:43:52,835
My mind is made up.

857
00:43:52,878 --> 00:43:54,781
I forbid it.

858
00:43:54,817 --> 00:43:56,286
No, you don't.

859
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,120
Rom, stay out of this.

860
00:43:58,157 --> 00:43:59,626
I will not.

861
00:43:59,727 --> 00:44:02,632
When it comes to the bar,
you may be in charge

862
00:44:02,669 --> 00:44:05,836
but, when it comes to my son,
I make the decisions.

863
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:07,311
Fine.

864
00:44:07,346 --> 00:44:08,975
You tell him he can't go.

865
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:13,222
Nog...

866
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,729
good luck.

867
00:44:14,763 --> 00:44:18,329
I would be proud
to have a son in Starfleet.

868
00:44:18,373 --> 00:44:20,606
You're both insane.

869
00:44:26,124 --> 00:44:29,325
Like father, like son.
