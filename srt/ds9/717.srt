1
00:00:02,597 --> 00:00:05,398
There are a few
wild <i>moba</i> trees here

2
00:00:05,435 --> 00:00:09,876
and a creek that runs through
the meadows and into the forest.

3
00:00:09,911 --> 00:00:11,778
Nice spot, huh?

4
00:00:11,815 --> 00:00:13,044
Bajor, right?

5
00:00:13,084 --> 00:00:15,554
The Kendra Province,
just south of the Yolja River.

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,423
I was there the other day.

7
00:00:17,459 --> 00:00:20,022
I thought you went to a
conference in Rakantha.

8
00:00:20,065 --> 00:00:21,728
I did, but afterwards

9
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:24,400
Vedek Oram wanted me
to visit his monastery.

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,966
We took a transport

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,239
across the mountains.

12
00:00:28,549 --> 00:00:30,519
The sun was
just going down

13
00:00:30,553 --> 00:00:34,584
and the entire valley
was shimmering in the light.

14
00:00:35,763 --> 00:00:38,758
And I said to myself

15
00:00:38,803 --> 00:00:42,105
"This is the place.

16
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,841
This is where I'm going
to build my house."

17
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:48,787
I've... heard you talk
that way before.

18
00:00:48,823 --> 00:00:50,884
Oh, no, this is not just talk.

19
00:00:50,927 --> 00:00:56,701
As of this morning,
all of this land belongs to me.

20
00:00:56,739 --> 00:00:58,470
You're serious.

21
00:00:58,508 --> 00:01:00,068
12 hecapates.

22
00:01:00,112 --> 00:01:03,016
I'm going to start building
as soon as the war is over.

23
00:01:04,821 --> 00:01:07,053
We'll have a place
that we can...

24
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:10,326
visit anytime we want.

25
00:01:10,365 --> 00:01:12,232
Sounds good to me.

26
00:01:12,336 --> 00:01:15,570
Maybe someday, I'll retire here.

27
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,343
Oh, I could see you now...

28
00:01:18,381 --> 00:01:20,851
sitting in your rocking chair

29
00:01:20,887 --> 00:01:24,554
watching the sun set over
the mountains every night...

30
00:01:24,594 --> 00:01:26,621
wondering where you put
your teeth.

31
00:01:26,665 --> 00:01:30,001
Just like
my great-great-grandfather...

32
00:01:30,038 --> 00:01:32,099
in the glass next to the chair.

33
00:01:35,683 --> 00:01:38,153
It's funny how things
turn out, isn't it?

34
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:39,554
What do you mean?

35
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,822
Did you ever think

36
00:01:41,862 --> 00:01:44,128
that you would become
so attached to Bajor

37
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:47,229
that you'd want to spend
the rest of your life there?

38
00:01:47,272 --> 00:01:48,262
Hmm.

39
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:53,307
It wasn't...
part of the master plan

40
00:01:53,351 --> 00:01:55,446
if that's what you mean.

41
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:58,222
But from the moment
I set foot on this station

42
00:01:58,261 --> 00:02:01,597
nothing has turned out
the way I imagined it.

43
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:06,432
This was supposed to be
just a temporary assignment

44
00:02:06,477 --> 00:02:10,315
but it's become
much more than that.

45
00:02:11,922 --> 00:02:15,417
I guess I was meant
to come here.

46
00:02:15,462 --> 00:02:16,896
You see, it's

47
00:02:16,932 --> 00:02:19,300
almost like my... my...

48
00:02:19,336 --> 00:02:20,463
Destiny.

49
00:02:20,505 --> 00:02:22,304
Destiny, yes.

50
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:26,305
I guess when your mother
turns out to be part Prophet

51
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,878
or part wormhole alien

52
00:02:28,923 --> 00:02:31,486
or whatever it is
you want to call her...

53
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:36,595
words like "destiny"
begin to mean something.

54
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:42,045
When I look at the picture
of this woman with my father

55
00:02:42,082 --> 00:02:46,751
I think to myself,
"Yes, that's Sarah, my mother."

56
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,355
But she's not just a woman...
she's more than that.

57
00:02:49,396 --> 00:02:51,366
And when I look at myself
in the mirror...

58
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,272
You don't just see a man...
you see more than that.

59
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:58,677
Does that bother you?

60
00:02:58,716 --> 00:03:01,279
Do I act like
it bothers me?

61
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,790
You're not answering
my question.

62
00:03:03,826 --> 00:03:07,425
I guess when you first
told me about Sarah

63
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:09,629
I was a little surprised.

64
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,638
More than a little.

65
00:03:10,672 --> 00:03:13,769
All right, I was
very surprised.

66
00:03:13,812 --> 00:03:16,180
But... the more
I thought about it

67
00:03:16,217 --> 00:03:19,621
the more I realized what
an amazing thing it was...

68
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,920
is.

69
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,591
I'm glad you think so.

70
00:03:23,631 --> 00:03:26,067
I do.

71
00:03:26,103 --> 00:03:28,666
And...

72
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,703
part-Prophet or not...

73
00:03:34,821 --> 00:03:37,793
you're still
my Benjamin

74
00:03:37,827 --> 00:03:39,490
and I love you.

75
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,417
I bumped into Captain Boday
the other night.

76
00:03:53,491 --> 00:03:55,188
Captain Boday?

77
00:03:55,228 --> 00:03:57,289
The Gallamite.
Jadzia dated him.

78
00:03:57,332 --> 00:04:00,168
Oh! The toothy smile and
the transparent skull?

79
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:01,173
That's him.

80
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:02,607
What's he doing
on the station?

81
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:05,375
The Gallamites are supplying
duranium for the war effort.

82
00:04:05,448 --> 00:04:08,113
Personally, I don't know what
Jadzia ever saw in the man.

83
00:04:08,154 --> 00:04:09,748
Well, his brains.

84
00:04:11,995 --> 00:04:13,258
Did he know who you were?

85
00:04:13,297 --> 00:04:14,060
Not at first.

86
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:15,067
But when he found out

87
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:16,569
I bet he laid on the charm.

88
00:04:16,604 --> 00:04:18,095
You could say that.

89
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:20,008
Ah, the man's insufferable.

90
00:04:20,044 --> 00:04:21,673
He's opinionated
and arrogant...

91
00:04:21,714 --> 00:04:22,682
And charming.

92
00:04:22,716 --> 00:04:24,048
If you say so.

93
00:04:26,825 --> 00:04:28,191
Something wrong?

94
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:30,322
We just got word
from the Klingons.

95
00:04:30,365 --> 00:04:31,560
The <i>Rotarran</i> and the <i>Koraga</i>

96
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,126
were ambushed
by a Dominion patrol

97
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:34,537
near the Badlands.

98
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:35,973
Worf was commanding
the <i>Koraga.</i>

99
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,103
It didn't make it.

100
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:39,708
The <i>Rotarran</i> recovered
six escape pods.

101
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,481
Worf wasn't aboard any of them.

102
00:06:49,296 --> 00:06:51,198
Heard anything
from the <i>Defiant?</i>

103
00:06:52,235 --> 00:06:54,501
I talked to Benjamin
this morning.

104
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,102
He said that, according
to the <i>Koraga's</i> crew

105
00:06:57,145 --> 00:07:00,140
Worf was the last one
to leave the Bridge.

106
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:02,518
No one knows if he made it
to the escape pod.

107
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,388
My money says he did.

108
00:07:05,428 --> 00:07:08,993
We haven't seen the last
of that crazy Klingon.

109
00:07:09,035 --> 00:07:11,700
They've been searching
for three days.

110
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,730
They'll find him.

111
00:07:12,776 --> 00:07:14,541
It's just going
to take a while.

112
00:07:17,085 --> 00:07:19,078
You know what it's
like in the Badlands.

113
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:21,024
There's a lot of
sensor interference.

114
00:07:22,162 --> 00:07:23,323
I should have gone
with them.

115
00:07:23,364 --> 00:07:25,698
And what would you be able
to do that they can't?

116
00:07:25,735 --> 00:07:27,261
Probably nothing,
but it would be easier

117
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:29,298
than just sitting here,
waiting.

118
00:07:32,482 --> 00:07:35,318
He'll be back
before you know it.

119
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:36,549
You really think so?

120
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:39,093
Absolutely.

121
00:07:40,932 --> 00:07:42,332
The night before
he went on patrol

122
00:07:42,368 --> 00:07:43,859
he brought the <i>Koraga's</i>
crew in here

123
00:07:43,904 --> 00:07:46,740
and bought them three
barrels of bloodwine.

124
00:07:46,777 --> 00:07:47,745
And?

125
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:50,181
And he didn't pay the tab.

126
00:07:50,218 --> 00:07:53,588
Do you really think
he'd go to <i>Sto-Vo-Kor</i>

127
00:07:53,624 --> 00:07:54,683
owing me money?

128
00:07:54,726 --> 00:07:56,696
He doesn't even like you.

129
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,028
Exactly!

130
00:07:58,067 --> 00:07:59,832
He couldn't enjoy
the afterlife

131
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,703
knowing I had
something on him.

132
00:08:07,352 --> 00:08:08,878
Thanks, Quark.

133
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:27,614
Ops to Lieutenant Dax.

134
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,296
Go ahead.

135
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,861
You have an incoming
transmission from the <i>Defiant.</i>

136
00:08:33,904 --> 00:08:36,033
Patch it through.

137
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,248
What is it, Benjamin?

138
00:08:41,286 --> 00:08:43,985
I'm afraid we're going to have
to call off the search.

139
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:45,015
You're giving up?

140
00:08:45,061 --> 00:08:46,529
We don't have any choice.

141
00:08:46,563 --> 00:08:48,328
There are
a dozen Jem'Hadar ships

142
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:49,835
closing on our position.

143
00:08:49,869 --> 00:08:51,998
But what if he's still
out there somewhere?

144
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,477
Let's face it...
the odds aren't good.

145
00:08:54,512 --> 00:08:57,484
We don't even know
if he made it off the <i>Koraga.</i>

146
00:08:57,518 --> 00:08:59,613
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:12,345
The <i>Defiant</i> is returning
to Federation space.

148
00:09:12,382 --> 00:09:13,816
I'm ordering our
ships to pursue.

149
00:09:13,851 --> 00:09:17,586
No. Divert them to the Son'a
outpost on Devos II.

150
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:18,991
Why?

151
00:09:19,028 --> 00:09:19,996
We need their help

152
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,624
to protect the new
ketracel-white facility.

153
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:23,362
The Federation...

154
00:09:23,404 --> 00:09:26,935
has been made aware
of its location.

155
00:09:26,977 --> 00:09:28,571
Can't the Son'a
protect it?

156
00:09:28,614 --> 00:09:31,643
Are you questioning
my orders?

157
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:34,920
That would be... foolish.

158
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,305
I wonder what...

159
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:44,072
the <i>Defiant</i>
was doing out there.

160
00:09:44,112 --> 00:09:46,675
Looking for survivors
from the <i>Koraga.</i>

161
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,241
For that long?

162
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,484
Our adversaries
don't view

163
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:53,052
their soldiers
as expendable.

164
00:09:53,097 --> 00:09:54,429
They're not bred

165
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:56,561
in hatcheries
like the Jem'Hadar.

166
00:09:58,407 --> 00:10:01,811
If you have something to say,
Damar, say it.

167
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,047
Do you have any idea

168
00:10:05,086 --> 00:10:07,420
the casualties
Cardassia has taken?

169
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,828
There's not one family that
hasn't lost someone in this war.

170
00:10:10,865 --> 00:10:15,864
Their sacrifices
won't be in vain.

171
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:19,176
We will be victorious.

172
00:10:21,853 --> 00:10:25,520
A bit early, isn't it...
even for you?

173
00:10:25,561 --> 00:10:27,360
Just something
to warm the bones.

174
00:10:27,398 --> 00:10:28,627
It's freezing in here.

175
00:10:30,304 --> 00:10:32,365
The Founder prefers it that way.

176
00:10:32,408 --> 00:10:33,934
I don't see
why we should suffer.

177
00:10:33,977 --> 00:10:35,537
She hasn't been in here
for days.

178
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:38,017
Feel free to dress warmly.

179
00:10:40,357 --> 00:10:44,263
I wonder what she does
in her quarters all day.

180
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:46,964
She didn't look well
the last time I saw her.

181
00:10:47,003 --> 00:10:48,734
I hope she's not ill.

182
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:50,208
How can a God be ill?

183
00:10:50,244 --> 00:10:53,182
Maybe she's not a God.

184
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:59,457
Whether you believe the Founders
are Gods or not is irrelevant.

185
00:10:59,495 --> 00:11:03,230
All they require from you
is obedience.

186
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:11,648
Now, the Founder wants
a subspace com link

187
00:11:11,686 --> 00:11:13,246
installed in her quarters.

188
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,258
I'll see to it.

189
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:15,351
A secure channel...

190
00:11:15,394 --> 00:11:17,193
separately encoded
and isolated

191
00:11:17,231 --> 00:11:19,224
from the main
communication array.

192
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:20,567
Why all the secrecy?

193
00:11:20,604 --> 00:11:21,902
Who's she going
to be talking to?

194
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,274
That doesn't concern you.

195
00:11:30,324 --> 00:11:32,089
No, of course it doesn't.

196
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,865
Computer,
override locking mechanism.

197
00:11:53,901 --> 00:11:54,926
Authorization.

198
00:11:54,969 --> 00:11:57,439
Authorization: Dax-nine-
seven-four-alpha-three.

199
00:11:57,475 --> 00:11:58,807
Confirmed.

200
00:12:05,156 --> 00:12:06,819
This <i>bat'leth</i> belonged
to my father.

201
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,388
I would like you
to have it, Jadzia.

202
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:12,869
Go, I will take care of Yoshi.

203
00:12:12,905 --> 00:12:15,536
Worf, that's very sweet,
but let's face it...

204
00:12:15,578 --> 00:12:17,377
you're not good with babies.

205
00:12:17,415 --> 00:12:20,080
I am a Klingon warrior.

206
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,613
I have stood in battle
against Kelvans twice my size.

207
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:26,427
I courted and won the heart
of the magnificent Jadzia Dax.

208
00:12:26,466 --> 00:12:27,992
If I can do these things

209
00:12:28,035 --> 00:12:30,471
I can make this child
go to sleep.

210
00:12:30,508 --> 00:12:36,214
You come first, before career,
before duty, before anything.

211
00:12:36,252 --> 00:12:37,652
I love you.

212
00:12:37,755 --> 00:12:39,520
And I love you.

213
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,961
Worf, we may never
see each other again

214
00:12:41,997 --> 00:12:43,295
but before you leave,

215
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,565
I want you to know
that the answer is "yes."

216
00:12:45,604 --> 00:12:47,597
Yes. Yes to what?

217
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:49,271
Yes, I will marry you.

218
00:12:49,312 --> 00:12:52,979
You must go to Sirella
and beg her forgiveness.

219
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:55,012
I don't beg.

220
00:12:55,056 --> 00:12:58,051
Jadzia, daughter of Kela

221
00:12:58,095 --> 00:13:01,329
does your heart beat
only for this man?

222
00:13:01,369 --> 00:13:02,803
Yes.

223
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:04,273
And do you swear
to join with him

224
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:08,340
and stand with him against
all who would oppose you?

225
00:13:08,383 --> 00:13:09,646
I swear.

226
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:12,121
And do you swear
to join with him

227
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:15,527
and stand with him against
all who would oppose you?

228
00:13:15,564 --> 00:13:17,261
I swear.

229
00:13:33,901 --> 00:13:35,028
Colonel.

230
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:37,005
Captain, we
have a problem.

231
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,805
It's Ezri.

232
00:13:38,844 --> 00:13:40,244
She's gone.

233
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,407
Gone?

234
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:42,712
There's a runabout missing.

235
00:13:42,785 --> 00:13:44,185
She must have gotten
it into her head

236
00:13:44,221 --> 00:13:45,189
to go looking for Worf.

237
00:13:45,223 --> 00:13:46,248
What could she
be thinking?

238
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,194
She's a Dax.

239
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:51,065
Sometimes they don't think...

240
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:52,228
they just do.

241
00:14:02,725 --> 00:14:04,422
I'm not spacesick.

242
00:14:04,462 --> 00:14:05,930
I'm not spacesick.
I'm not...

243
00:14:08,035 --> 00:14:09,526
Uh-oh.

244
00:14:09,572 --> 00:14:11,508
Sisko to <i>Ganda.</i>

245
00:14:14,147 --> 00:14:15,844
<i>Ganda,</i> respond.

246
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:19,916
<i>Ganda</i> here.

247
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,023
I'm not reading you very well.

248
00:14:23,065 --> 00:14:25,935
There's... interference.

249
00:14:25,971 --> 00:14:28,636
Dax, turn that ship
around and get back here.

250
00:14:28,677 --> 00:14:30,145
What was that, Benjamin?

251
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,418
Cut it out, old man.

252
00:14:33,453 --> 00:14:34,819
I'm not buying it.

253
00:14:38,262 --> 00:14:40,596
I gave you an order,
Lieutenant.

254
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,169
Don't worry, sir.

255
00:14:44,207 --> 00:14:45,334
I'll find him.

256
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,777
We can send the <i>Defiant</i>
to bring her back.

257
00:14:49,886 --> 00:14:51,583
No.

258
00:14:51,623 --> 00:14:53,490
Let her go.

259
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:55,018
Captain?

260
00:14:55,063 --> 00:14:57,796
Send her a copy of the
<i>Defiant's</i> sensor logs.

261
00:14:57,835 --> 00:15:01,468
There's no sense in her
searching the area we did.

262
00:15:03,012 --> 00:15:04,310
Aye, sir.

263
00:15:07,187 --> 00:15:10,216
Sir, do you think
there's any chance

264
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:11,750
she'll be able
to find him?

265
00:15:11,796 --> 00:15:13,993
I wish I could say yes.

266
00:15:14,034 --> 00:15:17,565
Then, may I ask why you're
letting her do this?

267
00:15:17,608 --> 00:15:20,603
Because she needs to...

268
00:15:20,647 --> 00:15:24,280
and because she'd never
forgive me if I stopped her.

269
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:32,766
Computer, show me
the position of the <i>Koraga</i>

270
00:15:32,805 --> 00:15:34,000
at the time it was attacked.

271
00:15:37,313 --> 00:15:39,715
Which escape pods
were recovered?

272
00:15:39,752 --> 00:15:42,724
The six starboard pods
were recovered.

273
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:44,819
Why none from the port side?

274
00:15:44,896 --> 00:15:46,125
Unknown.

275
00:15:49,404 --> 00:15:50,702
Assuming someone made it

276
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,177
to the port escape pod
closest to the Bridge

277
00:15:53,212 --> 00:15:54,646
calculate its trajectory.

278
00:15:58,623 --> 00:15:59,955
Computer, take us
to the coordinates

279
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,483
where it would've entered
the Badlands.

280
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:03,123
Acknowledged.

281
00:16:17,494 --> 00:16:19,487
Computer...

282
00:16:19,532 --> 00:16:21,331
cut all engines.

283
00:16:21,368 --> 00:16:23,770
Warning: Without
maneuvering thrusters

284
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:27,246
the ship may be swept into areas
of plasma-flare activity.

285
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,979
I know, but with any luck,
the currents will take us

286
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:32,012
to the same place
they took Worf.

287
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,086
Cut the engines.

288
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:16,879
Ben...

289
00:17:16,913 --> 00:17:18,108
Hmm?

290
00:17:18,148 --> 00:17:19,879
What are you doing up?

291
00:17:19,952 --> 00:17:22,184
I couldn't sleep.

292
00:17:22,223 --> 00:17:25,354
Oh, it's coming along.

293
00:17:29,204 --> 00:17:31,436
Well, I thought
if I did some work

294
00:17:31,475 --> 00:17:33,672
it would take my mind
off things.

295
00:17:33,713 --> 00:17:36,514
If Worf is out there,
she'll find him.

296
00:17:36,551 --> 00:17:38,111
Hmm.

297
00:17:38,155 --> 00:17:40,752
So, what do you think?

298
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:42,661
It's going to be beautiful.

299
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:48,097
These windows face south
towards the valley.

300
00:17:48,142 --> 00:17:49,805
Be a nice view.

301
00:17:49,845 --> 00:17:51,838
Did you know
there's a running stream

302
00:17:51,883 --> 00:17:53,512
on the property?

303
00:17:53,552 --> 00:17:56,149
And the soil is perfect
for growing <i>kava.</i>

304
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:58,491
I could make
my own spring wine.

305
00:17:58,529 --> 00:18:01,501
The Emissary's
special reserve...

306
00:18:01,535 --> 00:18:02,867
it'll be a big seller.

307
00:18:02,905 --> 00:18:04,134
Hmm.

308
00:18:05,811 --> 00:18:06,836
I can't decide

309
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:11,047
whether I should
open up this wall

310
00:18:11,087 --> 00:18:12,920
or keep
the kitchen separate.

311
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,858
No, open it up.

312
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:16,831
Who wants to be
locked away cooking

313
00:18:16,866 --> 00:18:18,392
when you've got
guests over?

314
00:18:18,435 --> 00:18:20,371
Well, a man needs
to concentrate in the kitchen.

315
00:18:20,406 --> 00:18:22,433
I mean, you can't have
people coming in

316
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,845
and sticking their fingers
in your pots.

317
00:18:24,882 --> 00:18:26,408
It's your house.

318
00:18:29,357 --> 00:18:31,190
I want it to be our house.

319
00:18:44,421 --> 00:18:45,821
Let's get married.

320
00:18:47,928 --> 00:18:49,625
Do you mean it?

321
00:18:49,665 --> 00:18:52,067
I love you.

322
00:18:52,103 --> 00:18:53,264
Oh...

323
00:18:56,712 --> 00:18:58,511
Well, does that mean "yes"?

324
00:18:59,517 --> 00:19:01,111
What do you think?

325
00:19:01,154 --> 00:19:03,056
If you're going
to play hard to get...

326
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:07,228
Aha.

327
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,937
What a beautiful ring.

328
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:21,895
Kasidy Yates...

329
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:24,092
will you marry me?

330
00:19:26,605 --> 00:19:28,700
Yes.

331
00:19:28,743 --> 00:19:30,940
Yes, Mr. Sisko...

332
00:19:30,981 --> 00:19:32,279
I will.

333
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:57,088
Warning: Plasma-flow
activity ahead.

334
00:19:58,502 --> 00:20:00,199
You're not kidding.

335
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:04,577
Re-establishing engine control
is recommended.

336
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:07,215
No.

337
00:20:07,253 --> 00:20:08,619
Let's sit tight.

338
00:20:08,655 --> 00:20:10,284
Our only hope
of finding that escape pod

339
00:20:10,326 --> 00:20:11,817
is to follow the currents.

340
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:15,796
Transfer all available power
to the shields.

341
00:20:15,837 --> 00:20:16,896
Acknowledged.

342
00:20:31,434 --> 00:20:33,267
Computer, hold position.

343
00:20:33,305 --> 00:20:35,673
Activate a tractor beam
and lock on to that pod.

344
00:20:47,066 --> 00:20:48,261
Worf.

345
00:20:53,145 --> 00:20:54,808
Ezri.

346
00:20:54,848 --> 00:20:56,477
You're hurt.

347
00:20:56,518 --> 00:20:58,511
It is nothing.

348
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,596
You are alone.

349
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:24,362
The <i>Defiant</i> was forced
to call off its search

350
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:25,841
because of the Jem'Hadar.

351
00:21:25,877 --> 00:21:27,106
Why would Captain Sisko risk

352
00:21:27,146 --> 00:21:29,343
sending a runabout
to look for me?

353
00:21:29,384 --> 00:21:30,784
He didn't.

354
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,792
I came without his permission.

355
00:21:36,765 --> 00:21:38,826
You're a fellow officer.

356
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,999
I would've done the same
for Kira or Julian.

357
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,372
Of course.

358
00:21:56,438 --> 00:21:58,101
I will do it myself.

359
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:01,974
I'll contact the station

360
00:22:02,016 --> 00:22:03,849
and tell them
we're on our way back.

361
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,532
Founder...
it is an honor

362
00:22:46,571 --> 00:22:48,131
to be summoned
to your presence.

363
00:22:48,174 --> 00:22:51,739
I trust the new communications
system meets your needs.

364
00:22:51,781 --> 00:22:53,683
It's adequate.

365
00:22:53,718 --> 00:22:54,686
I'm glad.

366
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,986
If I can be of any
further assistance...

367
00:22:58,028 --> 00:23:00,021
When the time comes.

368
00:23:02,403 --> 00:23:05,341
The vaccine...
how is it progressing?

369
00:23:06,477 --> 00:23:08,845
I regret that it failed
to stabilize

370
00:23:08,882 --> 00:23:10,852
the latest sample you provided.

371
00:23:10,886 --> 00:23:12,685
I see.

372
00:23:12,723 --> 00:23:14,590
I have a team
of Vorta doctors

373
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:17,029
working night and
day to find a cure.

374
00:23:18,301 --> 00:23:20,966
Have them document their efforts

375
00:23:21,007 --> 00:23:22,943
and then eliminate them.

376
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:25,346
Founder?

377
00:23:25,382 --> 00:23:26,509
Activate their clones

378
00:23:26,551 --> 00:23:29,216
and order them to continue
their predecessors' work.

379
00:23:29,256 --> 00:23:33,720
Perhaps a fresh perspective
will speed matters along.

380
00:23:33,765 --> 00:23:35,667
Of course.

381
00:23:35,702 --> 00:23:38,538
The Cardassians...
what have you told them?

382
00:23:38,575 --> 00:23:40,841
They know nothing.

383
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:42,211
Good.

384
00:23:42,249 --> 00:23:44,583
The sickness that has
infected the Great Link

385
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,590
is none of their concern.

386
00:23:46,624 --> 00:23:51,794
They may be our allies,
but they are not to be trusted.

387
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:55,000
We must not show weakness.

388
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:59,210
This unfortunate malady
will soon be behind us.

389
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:02,416
I won't rest
until a cure is found.

390
00:24:02,456 --> 00:24:05,292
See that you don't.

391
00:24:05,328 --> 00:24:09,564
We'll require... another sample.

392
00:24:09,603 --> 00:24:11,266
Very well.

393
00:24:28,942 --> 00:24:30,844
You may go now.

394
00:24:47,312 --> 00:24:48,644
So you approve?

395
00:24:48,681 --> 00:24:50,241
Approve? I'm the
one who set you up

396
00:24:50,285 --> 00:24:51,719
with Kasidy in
the first place.

397
00:24:51,754 --> 00:24:53,188
Yes, so you did.

398
00:24:53,224 --> 00:24:55,091
Practically had
to twist your arm.

399
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:56,323
"A freighter captain?

400
00:24:56,364 --> 00:24:58,266
You want me to go out
with a freighter captain?"

401
00:24:58,301 --> 00:25:00,328
Yeah, well, you have to admit
that the job description

402
00:25:00,372 --> 00:25:03,037
conjures up a certain image.

403
00:25:03,077 --> 00:25:05,445
Yeah. You shouldn't
have doubted me.

404
00:25:05,482 --> 00:25:06,950
I knew from the
first time I met her

405
00:25:06,984 --> 00:25:08,043
that she was the
woman for you.

406
00:25:08,154 --> 00:25:09,554
If you're going
to take credit

407
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,289
you are also going to have
to take on responsibilities.

408
00:25:12,329 --> 00:25:13,456
Like what?

409
00:25:13,498 --> 00:25:15,058
Like being my best man.

410
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,038
Are you serious?

411
00:25:17,072 --> 00:25:18,803
Absolutely.

412
00:25:18,842 --> 00:25:20,971
I mean, are, are you sure

413
00:25:21,012 --> 00:25:22,275
you don't want to ask
Grandpa or Dax?

414
00:25:22,316 --> 00:25:23,614
No, no.

415
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,813
So what do you say?

416
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:29,989
I'm honored.

417
00:25:33,304 --> 00:25:34,567
Best man, huh?

418
00:25:34,607 --> 00:25:35,768
Yes.

419
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:36,936
Yeah... that means

420
00:25:36,978 --> 00:25:39,073
I get to plan
the bachelor party.

421
00:25:58,388 --> 00:25:59,754
What are you doing?

422
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:03,321
I am realigning
the inertial stabilizers.

423
00:26:03,364 --> 00:26:06,359
But didn't you just do that
a few hours ago?

424
00:26:06,404 --> 00:26:07,429
I want to make sure

425
00:26:07,472 --> 00:26:09,506
the systems are running
at optimal efficiency.

426
00:26:10,508 --> 00:26:11,635
Right.

427
00:26:18,557 --> 00:26:21,495
So... what was it like

428
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,295
being in that escape pod
for so long?

429
00:26:23,334 --> 00:26:25,270
Quiet.

430
00:26:25,304 --> 00:26:27,001
What did you do
to spend the time?

431
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,440
Nothing.

432
00:26:28,477 --> 00:26:30,504
Nothing?

433
00:26:33,821 --> 00:26:36,418
I bet the acoustics in there
were pretty good.

434
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,796
What did you sing?
Klingon opera?

435
00:26:40,901 --> 00:26:42,564
I did not sing.

436
00:26:42,605 --> 00:26:44,096
Which one?

437
00:26:44,142 --> 00:26:47,080
<i>Shevok'tah gish?</i>

438
00:26:48,851 --> 00:26:50,445
No.

439
00:26:50,488 --> 00:26:52,822
<i>Gav'ot toH'va.</i>

440
00:26:52,892 --> 00:26:54,326
Ambitious.

441
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,594
Those solos
are for a tenor.

442
00:26:56,633 --> 00:26:58,728
As you said...

443
00:26:58,771 --> 00:27:01,470
the acoustics
were favorable.

444
00:27:04,649 --> 00:27:07,644
I remember the first night
that you played that for Jadzia.

445
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,620
I'm sorry.

446
00:27:15,504 --> 00:27:17,269
No need to apologize.

447
00:27:17,308 --> 00:27:20,371
Though I would prefer
we not discuss her.

448
00:27:20,414 --> 00:27:22,782
I understand.

449
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:31,965
What about Alexander?

450
00:27:32,003 --> 00:27:33,335
What about him?

451
00:27:33,373 --> 00:27:36,174
Is it all right if I ask
about the son of Worf?

452
00:27:36,213 --> 00:27:39,674
I hear he's been made
weapons officer of the <i>Ya'Vang.</i>

453
00:27:39,719 --> 00:27:41,951
They were shorthanded.

454
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,187
You make it sound
like he didn't deserve it.

455
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:47,798
That was not my intention.

456
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:51,468
Are you ever going
to ease up on him?

457
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,507
My relationship with Alexander
is not your concern.

458
00:27:55,551 --> 00:27:57,714
Oh, that's funny,
because on our wedding night

459
00:27:57,755 --> 00:27:59,554
you told me that...

460
00:27:59,592 --> 00:28:01,323
I'm sorry.

461
00:28:01,363 --> 00:28:03,833
I shouldn't have mentioned
our wedding night...

462
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:06,427
I mean, Jadzia's wedding night.

463
00:28:11,115 --> 00:28:12,744
This is ridiculous.

464
00:28:12,785 --> 00:28:14,253
We can't have
a conversation

465
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:15,689
if you refuse
to talk about the things

466
00:28:15,724 --> 00:28:16,851
that we have in common.

467
00:28:16,927 --> 00:28:19,865
Then perhaps we should not
have a conversation.

468
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:22,871
You have been avoiding me
for the past six months now.

469
00:28:22,905 --> 00:28:25,341
I did not ask you
to come aboard the station.

470
00:28:25,377 --> 00:28:28,747
And I would have left,
but you told me to stay.

471
00:28:28,784 --> 00:28:30,617
And I am beginning to regret it.

472
00:28:32,157 --> 00:28:33,147
If it wasn't for me

473
00:28:33,192 --> 00:28:35,685
you'd still be drifting around
in an escape pod

474
00:28:35,731 --> 00:28:36,960
singing Klingon opera.

475
00:28:40,608 --> 00:28:42,339
Sensors are
detecting two ships

476
00:28:42,378 --> 00:28:43,778
closing on our position.

477
00:28:43,814 --> 00:28:46,046
They're Jem'Hadar fighters.

478
00:28:47,187 --> 00:28:48,450
I'm dropping out of warp.

479
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,460
Is that a good idea?

480
00:28:50,494 --> 00:28:51,928
We cannot outrun them.

481
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:53,933
The Goralis
system is nearby.

482
00:28:53,967 --> 00:28:56,096
We might be able
to lose them there.

483
00:28:59,445 --> 00:29:00,971
They're coming in behind us.

484
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:09,089
Transfer auxiliary
power to aft shields.

485
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:12,497
Shields are down to 30 percent.

486
00:29:12,538 --> 00:29:14,804
I am taking us
into the atmosphere.

487
00:29:17,281 --> 00:29:19,615
Their ships are not designed
for sub-orbital flight.

488
00:29:26,165 --> 00:29:27,565
They are pulling away.

489
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:29,264
Glad to hear it,
but that last hit

490
00:29:29,305 --> 00:29:31,434
took out
our starboard thrusters.

491
00:29:33,012 --> 00:29:35,643
We are losing altitude.

492
00:29:35,684 --> 00:29:37,244
I can't compensate.

493
00:29:39,292 --> 00:29:40,955
We must abandon ship.

494
00:29:55,123 --> 00:29:56,591
Energize.

495
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:14,019
That was a good call.

496
00:30:14,127 --> 00:30:16,461
We may be here
several days.

497
00:30:16,499 --> 00:30:18,332
I will reconnoiter the area.

498
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,806
Set up a com link and try
to contact the station.

499
00:30:20,841 --> 00:30:22,036
Right.

500
00:30:22,077 --> 00:30:24,513
Where's the com unit?

501
00:30:26,953 --> 00:30:29,481
You didn't take one?

502
00:30:29,525 --> 00:30:31,051
I thought you did.

503
00:30:31,161 --> 00:30:32,926
No.

504
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:36,165
Now we have no way of
contacting the station.

505
00:30:36,205 --> 00:30:38,573
Thanks for spelling
it out for me.

506
00:30:40,848 --> 00:30:43,080
Look on the bright side.

507
00:30:43,152 --> 00:30:45,418
We'll have plenty
of time to talk.

508
00:30:59,418 --> 00:31:00,818
No, I-I-I know.

509
00:31:00,854 --> 00:31:03,256
What do you say
we have Bill Ross

510
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:05,057
perform the ceremony?

511
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:06,725
My mother would prefer
her daughter

512
00:31:06,766 --> 00:31:08,064
to be married by a minister

513
00:31:08,102 --> 00:31:10,470
but an Admiral
is the next best thing.

514
00:31:10,507 --> 00:31:12,170
That's good.
I'll talk to him.

515
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:14,442
About the guest list...

516
00:31:14,482 --> 00:31:18,217
I wanted to keep it small,
just family and friends.

517
00:31:18,255 --> 00:31:19,223
Well, that's fine by me.

518
00:31:19,257 --> 00:31:20,520
There's only room
for 30 or 40 people

519
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:22,087
in the Wardroom.

520
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,325
That just leaves the menu.

521
00:31:23,365 --> 00:31:25,767
Do you mind if I ask Quark
to do the catering?

522
00:31:25,804 --> 00:31:27,865
Just make sure
he doesn't overcharge us.

523
00:31:27,908 --> 00:31:29,810
I'll make sure
I can cut a deal.

524
00:31:31,381 --> 00:31:33,851
Kasidy, what else do
we need to talk about?

525
00:31:33,887 --> 00:31:36,586
I have the feeling we're
forgetting something.

526
00:31:36,626 --> 00:31:38,220
You tell me.

527
00:31:38,262 --> 00:31:39,925
You're the one
who's been married before.

528
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:41,366
Well, that's just it.

529
00:31:41,402 --> 00:31:43,872
It was a lot more
complicated before.

530
00:31:43,907 --> 00:31:45,375
People get carried
away with weddings.

531
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:49,407
I... just want it
to be nice and simple.

532
00:31:49,452 --> 00:31:51,980
Excuse me, Emissary.

533
00:31:52,023 --> 00:31:53,959
Hello, Sahgi.

534
00:31:53,994 --> 00:31:55,759
I wanted
to congratulate you...

535
00:31:55,797 --> 00:31:56,924
both of you.

536
00:31:56,966 --> 00:31:58,629
Oh, aren't you sweet.

537
00:31:58,670 --> 00:31:59,763
Thank you.

538
00:31:59,805 --> 00:32:02,402
Um, who told you
we were getting married?

539
00:32:02,444 --> 00:32:04,641
Everybody's talking about it.

540
00:32:04,682 --> 00:32:07,279
Can I be one
of your dais bearers?

541
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,788
My what, honey?

542
00:32:08,823 --> 00:32:10,314
For the bridal procession.

543
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:12,522
I know you
can only choose 51 girls

544
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:14,227
but it would be
such an honor for me.

545
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:16,898
Well, um...

546
00:32:16,939 --> 00:32:18,602
People are saying
it's going to be

547
00:32:18,643 --> 00:32:20,579
the biggest wedding
Bajor's ever seen.

548
00:32:20,614 --> 00:32:21,980
They are?

549
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:24,544
The Emissary's getting married.

550
00:32:25,824 --> 00:32:27,691
Ben?

551
00:32:27,728 --> 00:32:31,828
Kasidy... I think
this is going to be

552
00:32:31,869 --> 00:32:34,203
a little more complicated
than we thought.

553
00:32:50,574 --> 00:32:51,633
What I wouldn't give

554
00:32:51,676 --> 00:32:54,807
to wipe the smirk off
that little Vorta's face.

555
00:32:57,488 --> 00:33:03,729
Still... power does have
its privileges.

556
00:33:06,338 --> 00:33:07,670
Dukat.

557
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,308
Leave us.

558
00:33:24,842 --> 00:33:26,641
Does Weyoun
know you're here?

559
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:30,676
Ah, I see he still
has you under his thumb.

560
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,849
My concern is for you.

561
00:33:32,891 --> 00:33:36,091
The last time you saw him,
you made certain promises...

562
00:33:36,131 --> 00:33:38,033
promises you weren't
able to keep.

563
00:33:38,068 --> 00:33:41,438
I may have failed
to reopen the wormhole

564
00:33:41,475 --> 00:33:46,076
but I assure you,
I have no regrets.

565
00:33:46,117 --> 00:33:51,321
You see, I've come to know
the love of the Pah-wraiths.

566
00:33:52,898 --> 00:33:55,734
You almost sound
as if you believe it.

567
00:33:57,206 --> 00:33:58,903
I do.

568
00:34:01,214 --> 00:34:02,580
What brings you here?

569
00:34:02,618 --> 00:34:04,884
I've come to see you,
old friend.

570
00:34:04,922 --> 00:34:06,858
I need your help.

571
00:34:06,893 --> 00:34:08,954
I'm afraid you have
an exaggerated sense

572
00:34:08,997 --> 00:34:10,295
of my importance.

573
00:34:13,438 --> 00:34:14,804
Damar...

574
00:34:17,547 --> 00:34:19,141
But I'll do what I can.

575
00:34:20,754 --> 00:34:22,621
I knew you would.

576
00:34:46,945 --> 00:34:48,915
Dinner.

577
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:51,044
Why'd you have to kill
a defenseless animal?

578
00:34:51,087 --> 00:34:52,647
We have plenty of field rations.

579
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:55,160
I've been eating field
rations for six days.

580
00:34:55,195 --> 00:34:56,960
I am sick of field rations.

581
00:34:56,999 --> 00:34:58,399
So you traipsed into the jungle

582
00:34:58,435 --> 00:35:00,234
and phasered yourself
something to eat?

583
00:35:00,272 --> 00:35:02,333
I did not use a phaser.

584
00:35:02,376 --> 00:35:04,141
I used this.

585
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,480
Oh. Well, that makes it
all the more sporting.

586
00:35:06,517 --> 00:35:09,148
It took me hours
to track this animal

587
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,819
and while doing so,
I could have easily

588
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,557
been attacked by
a predator myself.

589
00:35:12,596 --> 00:35:16,000
Oh, spare me
the "one with nature" speech.

590
00:35:16,037 --> 00:35:18,600
I killed it, and now
I am going to eat it.

591
00:35:18,642 --> 00:35:20,042
If you do not want any

592
00:35:20,078 --> 00:35:22,275
then have some
more field rations.

593
00:35:22,316 --> 00:35:24,309
Fine.

594
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,993
Jadzia would have understood.

595
00:35:28,027 --> 00:35:30,999
Oh, I thought we weren't
supposed to talk about her.

596
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:33,766
I was merely making
an observation.

597
00:35:37,379 --> 00:35:40,180
Have you been able to
boost the combadge signal?

598
00:35:40,218 --> 00:35:42,883
Not enough to get a message
back to the station.

599
00:35:42,924 --> 00:35:45,828
I'll bet Jadzia
would have been able to do it.

600
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:50,233
I was merely making
an observation.

601
00:35:52,242 --> 00:35:56,478
Perhaps we should both refrain
from making observations.

602
00:35:56,517 --> 00:35:57,678
You're right.

603
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,451
Let's just go about
our own business

604
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,426
and exchange
as few words as possible.

605
00:36:05,268 --> 00:36:06,759
What is it about men?

606
00:36:06,805 --> 00:36:09,606
They either don't talk
at all... like you...

607
00:36:09,643 --> 00:36:12,979
or they talk too much...
like Boday.

608
00:36:13,017 --> 00:36:15,283
Boday?

609
00:36:15,322 --> 00:36:16,347
The Gallamite?

610
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:19,226
We had dinner on the station
before I left.

611
00:36:19,263 --> 00:36:21,062
I see.

612
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,536
If he talks so much

613
00:36:23,571 --> 00:36:25,200
why did you have
dinner with him?

614
00:36:25,242 --> 00:36:27,041
He's interesting

615
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:28,639
and he has
a good sense of humor.

616
00:36:36,364 --> 00:36:39,564
Tell me...

617
00:36:39,603 --> 00:36:41,470
did Jadzia?

618
00:36:45,148 --> 00:36:48,484
She and Boday, uh?

619
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:53,154
I don't have to answer
that question.

620
00:36:55,435 --> 00:36:56,596
She did.

621
00:36:57,907 --> 00:37:00,104
Worf, she didn't
even know you back then.

622
00:37:00,145 --> 00:37:01,113
I do not wish

623
00:37:01,147 --> 00:37:02,707
to hear your excuses.

624
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,347
My excuses?

625
00:37:05,388 --> 00:37:06,982
I'm not the one
who slept with him.

626
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:07,958
You had dinner with him.

627
00:37:07,994 --> 00:37:11,330
Who are you angry with...
me or Jadzia?

628
00:37:11,367 --> 00:37:12,426
Both.

629
00:37:12,469 --> 00:37:13,494
You know what?
You're crazy.

630
00:37:13,538 --> 00:37:14,836
You could make anyone crazy.

631
00:37:14,874 --> 00:37:15,933
Don't turn your back.

632
00:37:15,977 --> 00:37:17,206
Talk to me, you coward.

633
00:37:17,245 --> 00:37:20,308
Do not call me a coward.

634
00:37:21,354 --> 00:37:23,415
I can't believe
I'm stuck here with you.

635
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:24,585
Perhaps you would rather

636
00:37:24,627 --> 00:37:26,597
be back on the station
with Captain Boday

637
00:37:26,631 --> 00:37:28,260
you <i>sli'vak!</i>

638
00:38:22,476 --> 00:38:24,139
Ezri...

639
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,311
Where are we?

640
00:38:29,356 --> 00:38:31,349
I am not certain.

641
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,017
Why would the Breen
take us prisoner?

642
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,996
We are not at war with them.

643
00:38:50,031 --> 00:38:52,867
And what were they
doing on Goralis?

644
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:55,236
That's a long way
from Breen space.

645
00:38:55,275 --> 00:38:56,972
Ow.

646
00:39:00,518 --> 00:39:03,388
You must have gotten hurt
when they stunned us.

647
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:08,230
Actually, I think it
happened last night.

648
00:39:12,709 --> 00:39:15,237
You do not regret what happened
last night, do you?

649
00:39:15,281 --> 00:39:17,581
Why do you say that?

650
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:20,853
Jadzia explained to me
that joined Trill

651
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,868
are not supposed to become...
involved... with anyone

652
00:39:25,903 --> 00:39:28,203
they were intimate with
in a previous life.

653
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:31,806
I bet you've broken a few
Klingon rules in your time.

654
00:39:33,517 --> 00:39:34,883
What's that?

655
00:39:34,988 --> 00:39:37,481
We must be on a Breen ship.

656
00:39:55,957 --> 00:39:59,658
The Federation
has pulled the Sixth Fleet

657
00:39:59,698 --> 00:40:00,893
from the Bolian front.

658
00:40:00,934 --> 00:40:03,029
What do you suppose
they're planning?

659
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,766
Damar.

660
00:40:05,876 --> 00:40:07,367
Yes?

661
00:40:07,413 --> 00:40:08,881
What's wrong with you?

662
00:40:08,917 --> 00:40:10,146
You're distracted.

663
00:40:10,186 --> 00:40:11,586
Am I?

664
00:40:11,621 --> 00:40:13,591
You've been pacing
back and forth all morning.

665
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:15,788
Just trying to stay warm.

666
00:40:15,896 --> 00:40:16,795
Legate Damar.

667
00:40:16,898 --> 00:40:18,332
Please report
to your quarters.

668
00:40:18,368 --> 00:40:19,336
Acknowledged.

669
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:20,497
Excuse me.

670
00:40:20,539 --> 00:40:22,634
If you think I don't know
what you're up to

671
00:40:22,677 --> 00:40:24,647
you're a bigger fool than Dukat.

672
00:40:28,222 --> 00:40:30,317
Dukat?

673
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:33,820
He used to entertain
lady friends, as well.

674
00:40:36,138 --> 00:40:38,404
Guilty as charged.

675
00:40:53,973 --> 00:40:57,743
That surgeon you recommended
does excellent work.

676
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:01,378
What do you think?

677
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:08,492
Let's hope she does as well

678
00:41:08,535 --> 00:41:10,767
when it comes time
to reverse the procedure.

679
00:41:12,643 --> 00:41:15,843
Believe me, Damar,
I have no desire

680
00:41:15,916 --> 00:41:19,116
to remain a Bajoran
the rest of my life

681
00:41:19,157 --> 00:41:23,997
but for now,
I'm afraid it's necessary.

682
00:41:24,033 --> 00:41:28,873
Personal Log, Stardate 52576.2.

683
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:32,040
Dax and Worf
are four days overdue.

684
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:34,417
Dominion activity
at their last known position

685
00:41:34,454 --> 00:41:37,358
has prevented us
from sending a search team.

686
00:41:37,393 --> 00:41:40,490
For the time being,
there's nothing to do but wait

687
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:42,798
and hope
that they're all right.

688
00:41:48,315 --> 00:41:50,308
Why have you brought me here?

689
00:41:53,792 --> 00:41:56,058
Show yourselves.

690
00:41:56,097 --> 00:42:00,265
You are the Sisko.

691
00:42:00,306 --> 00:42:01,866
Sarah?

692
00:42:01,975 --> 00:42:05,506
You must accept your destiny.

693
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,290
Your path is a difficult one.

694
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:14,266
She cannot share it with you.

695
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,167
Are you talking about Kasidy?

696
00:42:16,204 --> 00:42:21,237
She cannot walk
the same path.

697
00:42:21,281 --> 00:42:23,615
You don't understand.

698
00:42:23,652 --> 00:42:25,315
I love her.

699
00:42:25,356 --> 00:42:27,292
We're going to be married.

700
00:42:27,326 --> 00:42:30,389
That is not your destiny.

701
00:42:30,432 --> 00:42:32,732
My destiny is my own.

702
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:34,865
I'm a man.

703
00:42:34,907 --> 00:42:36,672
I have the right
to live my life

704
00:42:36,711 --> 00:42:38,202
without your interference.

705
00:42:39,684 --> 00:42:41,483
I gave you life.

706
00:42:41,521 --> 00:42:44,925
Sarah Sisko was
my mother, not you.

707
00:42:44,961 --> 00:42:50,530
I shared her existence,
guided her to your father

708
00:42:50,572 --> 00:42:53,271
so that you would be born.

709
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:56,944
You must walk the path alone.

710
00:42:56,985 --> 00:42:58,614
You're not listening to me.

711
00:42:58,655 --> 00:43:01,057
I want to spend
my life with her.

712
00:43:01,094 --> 00:43:05,125
If you do, you will know
nothing but sorrow.

713
00:43:07,206 --> 00:43:09,438
You don't care how I feel.

714
00:43:09,477 --> 00:43:12,643
All that matters to you
is that I do what you want.

715
00:43:12,683 --> 00:43:14,083
You are the Sisko.

716
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,147
You are part of me.

717
00:43:17,893 --> 00:43:21,297
If that's true, if you
really do care about me

718
00:43:21,334 --> 00:43:23,429
if you do consider
me your son

719
00:43:23,472 --> 00:43:25,374
then let me have this.

720
00:43:25,409 --> 00:43:27,972
It is not for you to have.

721
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,416
There are still
many tasks ahead of you.

722
00:43:31,454 --> 00:43:34,324
Accept your fate.

723
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:38,300
Your greatest trial
is about to begin.

724
00:43:38,335 --> 00:43:40,805
Don't be afraid.

725
00:43:43,678 --> 00:43:47,982
All will be...
as it should be.

726
00:43:50,091 --> 00:43:51,958
Mother...

727
00:43:55,402 --> 00:43:59,137
Stay on the path, Benjamin.
