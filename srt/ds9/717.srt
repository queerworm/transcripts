1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:05,840
SISKO:
There are a few
wild<i> moba</i> trees here

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,093
and a creek that runs through
the meadows and into the forest.

3
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,303
Nice spot, huh?

4
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:12,888
Bajor, right?

5
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:15,390
The Kendra Province,
just south of the Yolja River.

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,518
I was there the other day.

7
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,812
I thought you went to a
conference in Rakantha.

8
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:21,563
I did, but afterwards

9
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,149
Vedek Oram wanted me
to visit his monastery.

10
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,860
We took a transport

11
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,027
across the mountains.

12
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,197
The sun was
just going down

13
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:34,409
and the entire valley
was shimmering in the light.

14
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:38,580
And I said to myself

15
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,750
<i>"This</i> is the place.

16
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,586
This is where I'm going
to build my house."

17
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:48,590
I've... heard you talk
that way before.

18
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,676
Oh, no, this is not just talk.

19
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:56,473
As of this morning,
all of this land belongs to me.

20
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,225
You're serious.

21
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,101
12 hecapates.

22
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,980
I'm going to start building
as soon as the war is over.

23
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,859
We'll have a place
that we can...

24
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:10,070
visit anytime we want.

25
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,031
Sounds good to me.

26
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:15,367
Maybe someday, I'll retire here.

27
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:18,078
Oh, I could see you now...

28
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,622
sitting in your rocking chair

29
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:24,292
watching the sun set over
the mountains every night...

30
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,336
wondering where you put
your teeth.

31
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,924
Just like
my great-great-grandfather--

32
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:31,926
in the glass next to the chair.

33
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:33,761
(<i> laughing</i> )

34
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,303
(<i> sighing</i> )

35
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,932
It's funny how things
turn out, isn't it?

36
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:39,307
What do you mean?

37
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,560
Did you ever think

38
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,854
that you would become
so attached to Bajor

39
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,941
that you'd want to spend
the rest of your life there?

40
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:48,108
Hmm.

41
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,988
It wasn't...
part of the master plan

42
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,156
if that's what you mean.

43
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,910
But from the moment
I set foot on this station

44
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,455
nothing has turned out
the way I imagined it.

45
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,167
This was supposed to be
just a temporary assignment

46
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:10,130
but it's become
much more than that.

47
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:15,176
I guess I was meant
to come here.

48
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,804
You see, it's

49
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:19,056
almost like my... my...

50
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,223
Destiny.

51
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,101
Destiny, yes.

52
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:26,021
I guess when your mother
turns out to be part Prophet

53
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,690
or part wormhole alien

54
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,192
or whatever it is
you want to call her...

55
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:36,406
words like "destiny"
begin to mean something.

56
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,870
When I look at the picture
of this woman with my father

57
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,374
I think to myself,
"Yes, that's Sarah, my mother."

58
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:49,044
But she's not just a woman--
she's more than that.

59
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,921
And when I look at myself
in the mirror...

60
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:55,174
You don't just see a man--
you see more than that.

61
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,345
Does that bother you?

62
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,973
Do I act like
it bothers me?

63
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,558
You're not answering
my question.

64
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:07,186
I guess when you first
told me about Sarah

65
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,023
I was a little surprised.

66
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:10,607
More than a little.

67
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,527
All right, I was
<i>very</i> surprised.

68
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,904
But... the more
I thought about it

69
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:19,449
the more I realized what
an amazing thing it was...

70
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,784
<i>is.</i>

71
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,411
I'm glad you think so.

72
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,998
I do.

73
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:28,458
And...

74
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,545
part-Prophet or not...

75
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,592
you're still
my Benjamin

76
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,260
and I love you.

77
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:53,150
I bumped into Captain Boday
the other night.

78
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,943
Captain Boday?

79
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,029
The Gallamite.
Jadzia dated him.

80
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:59,531
Oh! The toothy smile and
the transparent skull?

81
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:00,949
That's him.

82
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,035
What's he doing
on the station?

83
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:05,120
The Gallamites are supplying
duranium for the war effort.

84
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,040
Personally, I don't know what
Jadzia ever saw in the man.

85
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,457
Well, his brains.

86
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,459
(<i> chuckling</i> )

87
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,460
Did he know who you were?

88
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,712
Not at first.

89
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,047
But when he
found out

90
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:16,131
I bet he laid on the charm.

91
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:17,716
You could say that.

92
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,551
Ah, the man's insufferable.

93
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,011
He's opinionated
and arrogant...

94
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,262
And charming.

95
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,680
BASHIR:
If you say so.

96
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,768
Something wrong?

97
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,561
We just got word
from the Klingons.

98
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,063
The<i> Rotarran</i> and the<i> Koraga</i>

99
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:32,522
were ambushed
by a Dominion patrol

100
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,024
near the Badlands.

101
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,150
Worf was commanding
the<i> Koraga.</i>

102
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,902
It didn't make it.

103
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,196
The<i> Rotarran</i> recovered
six escape pods.

104
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,989
Worf wasn't aboard any of them.

105
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,870
Heard anything
from the<i> Defiant?</i>

106
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,998
I talked to Benjamin
this morning.

107
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,792
He said that, according
to the<i> Koraga's</i> crew

108
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,503
Worf was the last one
to leave the Bridge.

109
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,131
No one knows if he made it
to the escape pod.

110
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:05,967
My money says he did.

111
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:09,679
We haven't seen the last
of that crazy Klingon.

112
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,266
They've been searching
for three days.

113
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,683
They'll find him.

114
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,143
It's just going
to take a while.

115
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,731
You know what it's
like in the Badlands.

116
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:22,483
There's a lot of
sensor interference.

117
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,236
I should have gone
with them.

118
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:26,321
And what would you be able
to do that they can't?

119
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,031
Probably nothing,
but it would be easier

120
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,033
than just sitting here,
waiting.

121
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:36,039
He'll be back
before you know it.

122
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,165
You really think so?

123
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,751
Absolutely.

124
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:42,921
The night before
he went on patrol

125
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,756
he brought the<i> Koraga's</i>
<i>crew in here</i>

126
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:47,092
and bought them three
barrels of bloodwine.

127
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,593
And...?

128
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,762
<i>And</i> he didn't
pay the tab.

129
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:54,141
Do you really think
he'd go to<i> Sto-Vo-Kor</i>

130
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,267
owing me money?

131
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,269
He doesn't even like you.

132
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:58,686
Exactly!

133
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,439
He couldn't enjoy
the afterlife

134
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,316
knowing I had
something on him.

135
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,569
(<i> chuckling</i> )

136
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,530
Thanks, Quark.

137
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,216
Ops to Lieutenant Dax.

138
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,095
Go ahead.

139
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,431
You have an incoming
transmission from the<i> Defiant.</i>

140
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,683
Patch it through.

141
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,022
What is it, Benjamin?

142
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,358
I'm afraid we're going to have
to call off the search.

143
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:45,608
You're giving up?

144
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,068
We don't have any choice.

145
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,029
There are
a dozen Jem'Hadar ships

146
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,613
closing on our position.

147
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,449
But what if he's still
out there somewhere?

148
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,909
Let's face it--
the odds aren't good.

149
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,996
We don't even know
if he made it off the<i> Koraga.</i>

150
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,248
I'm sorry.

151
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,427
DAMAR:
The<i> Defiant</i> is returning
to Federation space.

152
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,179
I'm ordering our
ships to pursue.

153
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:17,724
No. Divert them to the Son'a
outpost on Devos II.

154
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:18,933
Why?

155
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,477
We need their help

156
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,853
to protect the new
ketracel-white facility.

157
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,646
The Federation...

158
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,941
has been made aware
of its location.

159
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,651
Can't the Son'a
protect it?

160
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,779
Are you questioning
my orders?

161
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:35,116
That would be... foolish.

162
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,540
I wonder what...

163
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,167
the<i> Defiant</i>
<i>was doing out there.</i>

164
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,836
Looking for survivors
from the<i> Koraga.</i>

165
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,338
For that long?

166
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,590
Our adversaries
don't view

167
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,218
their soldiers
as expendable.

168
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,677
They're not bred

169
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,888
in hatcheries
like the Jem'Hadar.

170
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:01,935
If you have something to say,
Damar, say it.

171
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,105
Do you have any idea

172
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,524
the casualties
Cardassia has taken?

173
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,818
There's not one family that
hasn't lost someone in this war.

174
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:15,949
Their sacrifices
won't be in vain.

175
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,369
We will be victorious.

176
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:25,625
A bit early, isn't it--
even for you?

177
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,502
Just something
to warm the bones.

178
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:28,920
It's freezing in here.

179
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,424
The Founder prefers it that way.

180
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:33,967
I don't see
why we should suffer.

181
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,718
She hasn't been in here
for days.

182
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,138
Feel free to dress warmly.

183
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:44,352
I wonder what she does
in her quarters all day.

184
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,980
She didn't look well
the last time I saw her.

185
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,773
I hope she's not ill.

186
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,275
How can a God be ill?

187
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,320
Maybe she's not a God.

188
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,534
Whether you believe the Founders
are Gods or not is irrelevant.

189
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:03,455
All they require from you
is obedience.

190
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:11,796
Now, the Founder wants
a subspace com link

191
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,381
installed in her quarters.

192
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,466
I'll see to it.

193
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:15,758
A secure channel--

194
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,344
separately encoded
and isolated

195
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,429
from the main
communication array.

196
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:20,847
Why all the secrecy?

197
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,140
Who's she going
to be talking to?

198
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,476
That doesn't concern you.

199
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,233
No, of course it doesn't.

200
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,838

209
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,778

210
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,448
WORF:
<i>I am a Klingon warrior.</i>

211
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,867

<i>against Kelvans twice my size.</i>

212
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,829
<i>I courted and won the heart</i>
<i>of the magnificent Jadzia Dax.</i>

213
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,498
<i>If I can do these things</i>

214
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,791
<i>I can make this child</i>
<i>go to sleep.</i>

215
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:36,590
<i>You come first, before career,</i>
<i>before duty, before anything.</i>

216
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,965
JADZIA:
<i>I love you.</i>

217
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,967
WORF:
<i>And I love you.</i>

218
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,053
JADZIA:
<i>Worf, we may never</i>
<i>see each other again</i>

219
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,930
<i>but before you leave,</i>

220
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,764
<i>I want you to know</i>
<i>that the answer is "yes."</i>

221
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,850
WORF:
<i>Yes. Yes to what?</i>

222
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,894
JADZIA:
<i>Yes, I will marry you.</i>

223
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:53,273
WORF:
<i>You must go to Sirella</i>
<i>and beg her forgiveness.</i>

224
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,316
JADZIA:
<i>I don't beg.</i>

225
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:58,319
SIRELLA:
<i>Jadzia, daughter of Kela</i>

226
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:01,239

227
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:03,074

229
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:08,371
<i>and stand with him against</i>
<i>all who would oppose you?</i>

230
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,248
JADZIA: (<i> softly</i> ):
<i>I swear.</i>

231
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,375

Colonel.

235
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,317
Captain, we
have a problem.

236
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,110
It's Ezri.

237
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,612
She's gone.

238
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:41,862
Gone?

239
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,364
There's a runabout missing.

240
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,574
She must have gotten
it into her head

241
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,824
to go looking for Worf.

242
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:46,785
What could she
be thinking?

243
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,536
She's a Dax.

244
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,414
Sometimes they don't think...

245
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,666
they just<i> do.</i>

I'm not reading you very well.

256
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,199
There's... (<i> imitating static)</i>
<i>interference.</i>

257
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,993
Dax, turn that ship
around and get back here.

258
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,578
What was that, Benjamin?

259
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,288
(<i> Dax imitating static</i> )

260
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,832
Cut it out, old man.

261
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,208
I'm not buying it.

262
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,168
(<i> Dax imitating static</i> )

263
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,130
I gave you an

264
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,509
Don't worry, sir.

265
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:45,802
I'll find him.

266
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,181
We can send the<i> Defiant</i>
<i>to bring her back.</i>

267
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,016
No.

268
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,893
Let her go.

269
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,687
Captain?

270
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:57,980
Send her a copy of the
<i>Defiant's</i> sensor logs.

271
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:02,026
There's no sense in her
searching the area we did.

272
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:04,821
Aye, sir.

273
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:10,618
Sir, do you think
there's any chance

274
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,078
she'll be able
to find him?

275
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,330
I wish I could say yes.

276
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,000
Then, may I ask why you're
letting her do this?

277
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,795
Because she needs to...

278
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:24,758
and because she'd
never forgive me
if I stopped her.

279
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,766
Computer, show me
the position of the<i> Koraga</i>

Which escape pods
were recovered?

283
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,734
The six starboard pods
were recovered.

284
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,903
Why none from the port side?

285
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:46,237

What are you
doing up?

Oh, it's coming along.

306
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,592
Well, I thought
if I did some work

307
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,720
it would take my mind
off things.

308
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,723
If Worf is out there,
she'll find him.

309
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,224
Hmm.

310
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,727
So, what do you think?

311
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,896
It's going to
be beautiful.

312
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:48,150
These windows face south
towards the valley.

313
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,819
Be a nice view.

314
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,905
Did you know
there's a running stream

00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,656
on the property?

316
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,200
And the soil is perfect
for growing<i> kava.</i>

317
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,494
I could make
my own spring wine.

318

319
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:02,957
it'll be a big seller.

Hmm.

321
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,086
I can't decide

322
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:11,131
whether I should
open up this wall

323
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,009
or keep
the kitchen separate.

324
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,802
No, open it up.

Well, a man needs
to concentrate in the kitchen.

328
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,518
I mean, you can't have
people coming in

in your pots.

00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,930

00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,049
Transfer all available power
to the shields.

358
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,257
Acknowledged.

359
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,765
(<i> gasping</i> )

360
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,440
Computer, hold position.

361
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,943
Activate a tractor beam
and lock on to that pod.

362
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,414
Worf.

363
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,754
Ezri.

364
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,630
You're hurt.

365
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,716
It is nothing.

366
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,234
(<i> exhausted sigh</i> )

367
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,864
You are alone.

368
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,491
The<i> Defiant</i> was forced
to call off its search

369
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,868
because of the Jem'Hadar.

370
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,327
Why would Captain Sisko risk

371
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,455
sending a runabout
to look for me?

372
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:30,831
He didn't.

373
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:34,043
I came without his permission.

374
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,756
You're a fellow officer.

375
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:41,050
I would've done the same
for Kira or Julian.

376
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,927
Of course.

377
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,192
I will do it myself.

378
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,155
I'll contact the station

379
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,073
and tell them
we're on our way back.

380
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,324
Founder...
it is an honor

381
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:48,450
to be summoned
to your presence.

382
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,912
I trust the new
communications system
meets your needs.

383
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,413
It's adequate.

384
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,082
I'm glad.

385
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,126
If I can be of any
further assistance...

386
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,129
When the time comes.

387
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,551
The vaccine--
how is it progressing?

388
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,971
I regret that it failed
to stabilize

389
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,931
the latest sample you provided.

390
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,933
I see.

391
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,727
I have a team
of Vorta doctors

392
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,146
working night and
day to find a cure.

393
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:21,067
Have them document their efforts

394
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,693
and then eliminate them.

395
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,238
Founder?

396
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,073
Activate their clones

397
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,242
and order them to continue
their predecessors' work.

398
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:33,954
Perhaps a fresh perspective
will speed matters along.

399
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,831
Of course.

400
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,709
The Cardassians--
what have you told them?

401
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,753
They know nothing.

402
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,462
Good.

403
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,757
The sickness that has
infected the Great Link

404
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,759
is none of their concern.

405
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:51,972
They may be our allies,
but they are not to be trusted.

406
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:55,017
We must not show weakness.

407
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:59,146
This unfortunate malady
will soon be behind us.

408
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:02,566
I won't rest
until a cure is found.

409
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,443
See that you don't.

410
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:09,782
We'll require... another sample.

411
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,449
Very well.

412
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,137
You may go now.

413
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:49,613
So you approve?
Approve?

414
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,865
I'm the one who set you up
with Kasidy in
the first place.

415
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,743
Yes, so you did.
Practically had
to twist your arm.

416
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,997
"A freighter captain?
You want me to go out
with a freighter captain?"

417
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:02,584
Yeah, well, you have to admit
that the job description
conjures up a certain image.

418
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,920
Yeah. You shouldn't
have doubted me.

419
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,798
I knew from the first time
I met her that she
was the woman for you.

420
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:09,467
If you're going
to take credit,

421
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:12,428
you are also going to have
to take on responsibilities.

422
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,805
Like what?
Like being my best man.

423
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,851
Are you serious?
Absolutely.

424
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,937
I mean, are, are you sure
you don't want to ask
Grandpa or Dax?

425
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:22,980
No, no.

426
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,109
So what do you say?

427
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,237
I'm honored.

428
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,447
(<i> laughs softly</i> )

429
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:34,658
Best man, huh?

430
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:35,701
Yes.

431
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,203
Yeah... that means

432
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:39,163
I get to plan the
bachelor party.

433
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:40,956
(<i> chuckling</i> )

434
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,967
(<i> console beeping</i> )

435
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,683
What are you doing?

436
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,978
I am realigning
the inertial stabilizers.

437
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,647
But didn't you just do that
a few hours ago?

438
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,441
I want to make sure

439
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:09,735
the systems are running
at optimal efficiency.

440
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:11,904
Right.

441
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,908
(<i> sighs</i> )

442
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,663
So... what was it like

443
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,457
being in that escape pod
for so long?

444
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,376
Quiet.

445
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:27,127
What did you do
to spend the time?

446
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,670
Nothing.

447
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,756
Nothing?

448
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:36,636
I bet the acoustics in there
were pretty good.

449
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,933
What did you sing?
Klingon opera?

450
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,726
I did not sing.

451
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,144
Which one?

452
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:47,189
<i>Shevok'tah gish?</i>

453
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,568
No.

454
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,903
<i>Gav'ot toH'va.</i>

455
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:54,447
Ambitious.

456
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:56,740
Those solos
are for a tenor.

457
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,658
As you said...

458
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:01,745
the acoustics
were favorable.

459
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,960
I remember the first night
that you played that for Jadzia.

460
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,922
I'm sorry.

461
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,344
No need to apologize.

462
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,556
Though I would prefer
we not discuss her.

463
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,975
I understand.

464
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,316
(<i> sighs</i> )

465
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,067
What about Alexander?

466
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,735
What about him?

467
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,155
Is it all right if I ask
about the son of Worf?

468
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:39,783
I hear he's been made
weapons officer of the<i> Ya'Vang.</i>

469
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,868
They were shorthanded.

470
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:44,330
You make it sound
like he didn't deserve it.

471
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,000
That was not my intention.

472
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:51,545
Are you ever going
to ease up on him?

473
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:55,549
My relationship with Alexander
is not your concern.

474
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,843
Oh, that's funny,
because on our wedding night

475
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,677
you told me that...

476
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,430
I'm sorry.

477
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,974
I shouldn't have mentioned
our wedding night...

478
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:06,602
I mean,<i> Jadzia's</i> wedding night.

479
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,395
(<i> sighs</i> )

480
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:14,234
This is ridiculous.
We can't have a conversation

481
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:17,154
if you refuse
to talk about the things
that we have in common.

482
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,906
Then perhaps we should not
<i>have</i> a conversation.

483
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,909
You have been avoiding me
for the past six months now.

484
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,496
I did not ask you
to come aboard the station.

485
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:28,706
And I would have left,
but you told me to stay.

486
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,543
And I am beginning
to regret it.

487
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:33,045
(<i> scoffs</i> )
If it wasn't for me,

488
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:36,923
you'd still be drifting around
in an escape pod
singing Klingon opera.

489
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,134
(<i> console beeping</i> )

490
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,760
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

491
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,805
Sensors are
detecting two ships
closing on our position.

492
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,141
They're Jem'Hadar fighters.

493
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:48,602
I'm dropping out of warp.

494
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:50,604
Is that a good idea?

495
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:52,022
We cannot outrun them.

496
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:53,857
The Goralis
system is nearby.

497
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,193
We might be able
to lose them there.

498
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,114
They're coming in behind us.

499
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:09,248
Transfer auxiliary
power to aft shields.

500
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,710
Shields are down to 30 percent.

501
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,087
I am taking us
into the atmosphere.

502
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,883
Their ships are not designed
for sub-orbital flight.

503
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:27,725
They are pulling away.

504
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:29,393
Glad to hear it,
but that last hit

505
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:31,645
took out
our starboard thrusters.

506
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:35,815
We are losing altitude.

507
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,317
I can't compensate.

508
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,361
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

509
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,113
We must abandon ship.

510
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:51,624
(<i> alarm continues</i> )

511
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,795
Energize.

512
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,104
That was a good call.

513
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:16,607
We may be here
several days.

514
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:18,400
I will reconnoiter the area.

515
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,986
Set up a com link and try
to contact the station.

516
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,821
Right.

517
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,657
Where's the com unit?

518
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,578
You didn't take one?

519
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:31,037
I thought you did.

520
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,872
(<i> sighing</i> ):
No.

521
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:36,168
Now we have no way of
contacting the station.

522
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:38,671
Thanks for spelling
it out for me.

523
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:41,006
(<i> frustrated sigh</i> )

524
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,049
Look on the bright side.

525
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,511
We'll have plenty
of time to talk.

526
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,399
(<i> laughing</i> )

527
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,900
No, I-I-I know.

528
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,320
What do you say
we have Bill Ross

529
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,071
perform the ceremony?

530
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,948
My mother would prefer
her daughter

531
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,408
to be married by a minister

532
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,410
but an Admiral
is the next best thing.

533
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,245
That's good.
I'll talk to him.

534
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,540
About the guest list--

535
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,876
I wanted to keep it small,
just family and friends.

536
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,419
Well, that's fine by me.

537
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,671
There's only room
for 30 or 40 people

538
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:21,839
in the Wardroom.

539
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:23,590
That just leaves the menu.

540
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,884
Do you mind if I ask Quark
to do the catering?

541
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,886
Just make sure
he doesn't overcharge us.

542
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,013
I'll make sure
I can cut a deal.

543
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,975
Kasidy, what else do
we need to talk about?

544
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,729
I have the feeling we're
forgetting something.

545
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:38,146
You tell me.

546
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,023
You're the one
who's been married before.

547
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,608
Well, that's just it.

548
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,027
It was a lot more
complicated before.

549
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,571
People get carried
away with weddings.

550
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:49,491
I... just want it
to be nice and simple.

551
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:52,035
Excuse me, Emissary.

552
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,037
Hello, Sahgi.

553
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,914
I wanted
to congratulate you--

554
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,040
both of you.

555
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,709
Oh, aren't you sweet.

556
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:00,252
Thank you.

557
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,462
Um, who told you
we were getting married?

558
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,715
Everybody's talking about it.

559
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:07,384
Can I be one
of your dais bearers?

560
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:08,968
My what, honey?

561
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,429
For the bridal procession.

562
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:12,598
I know you
can only choose 51 girls

563
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,307
but it would be
such an honor for me.

564
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:17,018
Well, um...

565
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,687
People are saying
it's going to be

566
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,731
the biggest wedding
Bajor's ever seen.

567
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:22,107
They are?

568
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:24,234
The Emissary's getting married.

569
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:25,527
(<i> excited voices approaching)</i>

570
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,738
Ben?

571
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:31,909
Kasidy... I think
this is going to be

572
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:34,286
a little more complicated
than we thought.

573
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:38,415
(<i> excited murmuring</i> )

574
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,887
What I wouldn't give

575
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:54,973
to wipe the smirk off
that little Vorta's face.

576
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:03,941
Still... power does have
its privileges.

577
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,861
Dukat.

578
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,408
Leave us.

579
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:26,755
Does Weyoun
know you're here?

580
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:30,801
Ah, I see he still
has you under his thumb.

581
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:32,928
My concern is for you.

582
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:36,097
The last time you saw him,
you made certain promises--

583
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,057
promises you weren't
able to keep.

584
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:41,394
I may have failed
to reopen the wormhole

585
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:46,065
but I assure you,
I have no regrets.

586
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:51,363
You see, I've come to know
the love of the Pah-wraiths.

587
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:55,868
You almost sound
as if you believe it.

588
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,078
I do.

589
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,999
What brings you here?

590
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:04,417
I've come to see you,
old friend.

591
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,336
I need your help.

592
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:08,505
I'm afraid you have
an exaggerated sense

593
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:09,715
of my importance.

594
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:14,344
Damar...

595
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,724
But I'll do what I can.

596
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,101
I knew you would.

597
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,160
(<i> leaves rustling</i> )

598
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:47,002
(<i> grunting</i> )

599
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:48,837
Dinner.

600
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,172
Why'd you have to kill
a defenseless animal?

601
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,799
We have plenty of field rations.

602
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,260
I've been eating field
rations for six days.

603
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,054
I am sick of field rations.

604
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:58,638
So you traipsed into the jungle

605
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,473
and phasered yourself
something to eat?

606
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,559
I did not use a phaser.

607
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,269
I used this.

608
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,521
Oh. Well, that makes it
all the more sporting.

609
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,274
It took me hours
to track this animal

610
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,817
and while doing so,
I could have easily

611
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,569
been attacked by
a predator myself.

612
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:16,031
Oh, spare me
the "one with nature" speech.

613
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:18,617
I killed it, and now
I am going to eat it.

614
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,118
If you do not want any

615
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,495
then have some
more field rations.

616
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,539
Fine.

617
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:28,043
Jadzia would
have understood.

618
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:31,004
Oh, I thought we weren't
supposed to talk about her.

619
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:33,840
I was merely making
an observation.

620
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:40,221
Have you been able to
boost the combadge signal?

621
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,849
Not enough to get a message
back to the station.

622
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,894
I'll bet Jadzia
would have been able to do it.

623
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,398
I was merely making
an observation.

624
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:56,362
Perhaps we should both refrain
from making observations.

625
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,864
You're right.

626
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,532
Let's just go about
our own business

627
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,701
and exchange
as few words as possible.

628
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:06,957
What is it about men?

629
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:09,626
They either don't talk
at all-- like you--

630
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:13,130
or they talk too much--
like Boday.

631
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,132
Boday?

632
00:36:15,132 --> 00:36:16,800
The Gallamite?

633
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,427
We had dinner on the station
before I left.

634
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,179
I see.

635
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,640
If he talks so much

636
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,350
why did you have
dinner with him?

637
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,060
He's interesting

638
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,854
and he has
a good sense of humor.

639
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:39,656
Tell me...

640
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:41,700
did Jadzia...?

641
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,707
she and Boday, uh...?

642
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:53,294
I don't have to answer
that question.

643
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,673
She did.

644
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:58,175
(<i> sighs</i> )

645
00:36:58,175 --> 00:37:00,259
Worf, she didn't
even know you back then.

646
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,427
I do not wish

647
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,804
to hear your excuses.

648
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:05,515
<i>My</i> excuses?

649
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:06,892
I'm not the one
who slept with him.

650
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:08,351
You had dinner with him.

651
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:11,354
Who are you angry with--
me or Jadzia?

652
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,605
Both.

653
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,024
You know what?
You're crazy.

654
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:15,192
You could make
anyone crazy.

655
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:16,359
Don't turn your back.

656
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,485
Talk to me, you coward.

657
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,279
Do not call me a coward.

658
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,698
(<i> frustrated grunt</i> )

659
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,324
I can't believe
I'm stuck here with you.

660
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,910
Perhaps you would rather

661
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,703
be back on the station
with Captain Boday

662
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,454

Ezri...

667
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,515
Where are we?

668
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,559
I am not certain.

669
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,820
(<i> grunting</i> )

670
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:48,118
Why would the Breen
take us prisoner?

671
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:49,953
We are not at war with them.

672
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:52,831
And what were they
doing on Goralis?

673
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,374
That's a long way
from Breen space.

674
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:57,043
Ow.

675
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,591
You must have gotten hurt
when they stunned us.

676
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:08,429
Actually, I think it
happened last night.

677
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:15,394
You do not regret what happened
last night, do you?

678
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,814
Why do you say that?

679
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:20,984
Jadzia explained to me
that joined Trill

680
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:25,905
are not supposed to become...
involved... with anyone

681
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:28,200
they were intimate with
in a previous life.

682
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,828
I bet you've broken a few
Klingon rules in your time.

683
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:33,663
(<i> engines rumbling</i> )

684
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,040
What's that?

685
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,709
We must be on a Breen ship.

686
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:59,898
The Federation
has pulled the Sixth Fleet

687
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,316
from the Bolian front.

688
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,318
What do you suppose
they're planning?

689
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,071
Damar.

690
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:07,697
Yes?

691
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:09,074
What's wrong with you?

692
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:10,449
You're distracted.

693
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,035
Am I?

694
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:13,786
You've been pacing
back and forth all morning.

to stay warm.

Legate Damar.

697
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:18,375
Please report
to your quarters.

698
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:19,376
Acknowledged.

699
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:21,002
Excuse me.

700
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:22,879
If you think I don't know
what you're up to

701
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,048
you're a bigger fool than Dukat.

702
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,511
Dukat?

703
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:34,099
He used to entertain
lady friends, as well.

704
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:38,728
Guilty as charged.

705
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:58,123
That surgeon you recommended
does excellent work.

706
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,751
What do you think?

707
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,758
Let's hope she does as well

708
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,927
when it comes time
to reverse the procedure.

(<i> laughing</i> )

710
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,974
Believe me, Damar,
I have no desire

to remain a Bajoran
the rest of my life

712
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:24,149
but for now,
I'm afraid it's necessary.

00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:34,617
<i>Dominion activity</i>
<i>at their last known position</i>

716
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:37,495
<i>has prevented us</i>
<i>from sending a search team.</i>

717
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,706
<i>For the time being,</i>
<i>there's nothing to do but wait</i>

718
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:43,168
<i>and hope</i>
<i>that they're all right.</i>

719
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,508
Why have you brought me here?

720
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:54,012
(<i> heartbeat thumping</i> )

721
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,264
Show yourselves.

722
00:41:56,264 --> 00:42:00,559
You are the Sisko.

723
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,145
Sarah?

724
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:05,898
You must accept your destiny.

725
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:11,570
Your path is
a difficult one.

726
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,449
She cannot share it
with you.

727
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:16,409
Are you talking
about Kasidy?

728
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:21,456
She cannot walk
the same path.

729
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:23,958
You don't understand.

730
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,543
I love her.

731
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,586
We're going to be married.

732
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:30,673
That is not your destiny.

733
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,967
My destiny is my own.

734
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,011
I'm a man.

735
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:36,929
I have the right
to live my life

736
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,473
without your
interference.

737
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:41,684
I gave you life.

738
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:45,063
Sarah Sisko was
my mother, not you.

739
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:50,860
I shared her existence,
guided her to your father

740
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:53,488
so that you would be born.

741
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:57,033
You must walk the path alone.

742
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:58,868
You're not listening to me.

743
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:01,246
I want to spend
my life with her.

744
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:05,417
If you do, you will know
nothing but sorrow.

745
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:09,712
You don't care how I feel.

746
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:13,007
All that matters to you
is that I do what you want.

747
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,300
You are the Sisko.

748
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,428
You are part of me.

749
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:21,474
If that's true, if you
really do care about me

750
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:23,726
if you do consider
me your son

751
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,686
then let me have this.

752
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:28,231
It is not for you to have.

753
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:31,359
There are still
many tasks ahead of you.

754
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,945
Accept your fate.

755
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:38,199
Your greatest trial
is about to begin.

756
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:40,701
Don't be afraid.

757
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:47,375
All will be...
as it should be.

758
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:51,421
Mother...

759
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:59,011
Stay on the path, Benjamin.
