1
00:00:05,674 --> 00:00:07,144
What about Captain Boday?

2
00:00:07,178 --> 00:00:08,272
Captain Boday?

3
00:00:08,315 --> 00:00:10,287
You want me to bring
Captain Boday

4
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:11,916
to your quarters for dinner?

5
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,154
It's just a suggestion.

6
00:00:13,195 --> 00:00:14,391
It's a bad suggestion.

7
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:16,962
Number one, you used
to go out with Captain Boday;

8
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:19,536
number two, Worf hates
him; and number three...

9
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:21,608
and we've discussed this
many times...

10
00:00:21,652 --> 00:00:23,954
Captain Boday has
a transparent skull.

11
00:00:23,992 --> 00:00:26,966
And you don't like
to see a man's brains.

12
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:27,992
Ops.

13
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:33,351
What about Dr. Trag'tok?

14
00:00:33,385 --> 00:00:37,853
He's intelligent;
he has a good physique...

15
00:00:37,897 --> 00:00:40,369
and he has
a very opaque cranium.

16
00:00:40,405 --> 00:00:43,072
True,
but his eye bothers me.

17
00:00:43,112 --> 00:00:44,081
Which one?

18
00:00:44,115 --> 00:00:45,141
The middle one.

19
00:00:45,184 --> 00:00:46,848
Oh, really.

20
00:00:46,889 --> 00:00:48,952
You are so obsessed
with appearances.

21
00:00:48,995 --> 00:00:52,493
And sometimes your taste
in men frightens me.

22
00:00:52,538 --> 00:00:54,270
I'll make sure
to tell Worf you said so.

23
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,404
Tell me what?

24
00:00:55,447 --> 00:00:57,145
Don't be so nosy.

25
00:00:57,185 --> 00:01:00,456
Hmm. You could always
invite Odo as a friend.

26
00:01:01,798 --> 00:01:04,499
I'm not ready for that;
Odo's not ready for that.

27
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:07,605
Let's just forget that
you brought that one up.

28
00:01:07,648 --> 00:01:10,247
Two <i>raktajinos,</i>
extra-strong, and a <i>kava</i> roll.

29
00:01:10,288 --> 00:01:12,054
I'm coming to dinner
alone, got it?

30
00:01:12,093 --> 00:01:13,426
I got it.

31
00:01:13,464 --> 00:01:15,459
Three place settings.

32
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:18,232
I'll bring the wine.

33
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:22,412
Captain,
you better get out here.

34
00:01:24,628 --> 00:01:26,223
What is it?

35
00:01:26,266 --> 00:01:28,203
I'm showing a power buildup
in the transporter buffer.

36
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:29,937
Someone's attempting
to beam into Ops.

37
00:01:29,977 --> 00:01:31,572
From where?

38
00:01:31,615 --> 00:01:32,584
I don't know.

39
00:01:32,617 --> 00:01:33,916
There are no ships
within transporter range.

40
00:01:45,587 --> 00:01:47,217
Are you hurt?

41
00:01:48,528 --> 00:01:49,554
No.

42
00:01:49,598 --> 00:01:50,931
But you'll be

43
00:01:50,968 --> 00:01:54,273
unless you do
exactly what I say.

44
00:01:57,587 --> 00:01:59,582
It can't be.

45
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,826
What do you want?

46
00:03:59,307 --> 00:04:00,971
A fast ship would be nice.

47
00:04:05,993 --> 00:04:08,158
Security...

48
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:10,194
we have a hostage situation.

49
00:04:10,238 --> 00:04:12,642
Clear a path to Landing Pad A.

50
00:04:12,678 --> 00:04:16,644
Authorization:
Sisko-seven-one-green.

51
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:19,219
Seven-one-green acknowledged,
Captain.

52
00:04:19,263 --> 00:04:21,360
Your runabout's waiting.

53
00:04:21,403 --> 00:04:23,101
Let's go.

54
00:04:24,211 --> 00:04:25,180
If you hurt her

55
00:04:25,214 --> 00:04:27,014
you will never
leave this station.

56
00:04:27,118 --> 00:04:28,280
I promise you that.

57
00:04:28,322 --> 00:04:30,692
Follow me, and she dies...
I promise you that.

58
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:31,719
Hold it!

59
00:04:45,002 --> 00:04:47,703
Ah-ah.
Not the turbolift.

60
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:51,914
Someone might cut the power,
and we'd be trapped inside.

61
00:04:51,955 --> 00:04:53,322
Then we walk.

62
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:11,408
Your, uh, uniform...

63
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:13,881
I've never seen one like it.

64
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:17,085
You're not with the Alliance,
are you?

65
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,222
There is no Alliance here.

66
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:24,744
Then I have crossed
into the alternate universe.

67
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,307
Tell you one thing.

68
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,116
The food's better.

69
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:30,992
So, I take it you're running
from the Alliance.

70
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:33,526
Now you know
the story of my life.

71
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,462
So, once you get your ship,
what then?

72
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:36,293
Believe me, wherever I end up

73
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,467
is going to be a lot better
than where I've been.

74
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:40,808
I can believe that.

75
00:05:40,846 --> 00:05:43,182
I've spent some time
in your universe.

76
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,023
I'll bet you were
glad to leave it.

77
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:47,360
Now which way?

78
00:05:47,398 --> 00:05:48,662
That way.

79
00:05:53,983 --> 00:05:57,425
How many levels before
we reach the landing pad?

80
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:58,621
Fifty-seven.

81
00:05:58,662 --> 00:06:00,394
Oh...

82
00:06:10,061 --> 00:06:11,622
Here we are.

83
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,296
Landing Pad A.

84
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,105
Open it.

85
00:06:16,145 --> 00:06:18,914
I've got a better idea.

86
00:06:18,953 --> 00:06:21,483
Why don't you hand
over that disruptor?

87
00:06:21,527 --> 00:06:24,524
Oh, you've been
so cooperative up to now.

88
00:06:24,568 --> 00:06:26,129
I'd hate to have to kill you.

89
00:06:26,173 --> 00:06:27,403
You're not going to kill me.

90
00:06:27,443 --> 00:06:28,412
Oh, you sure of that?

91
00:06:28,446 --> 00:06:29,540
You're not going
to kill anyone...

92
00:06:29,582 --> 00:06:31,143
not with that disruptor.

93
00:06:31,187 --> 00:06:33,090
Power cell's cracked.

94
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,463
How long have you known?

95
00:06:37,504 --> 00:06:38,768
Since we left Ops.

96
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:40,838
Then... why
did you come with me?

97
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,284
I needed the exercise.

98
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:45,920
And I have to get away.

99
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:53,308
You all right, Major?

100
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:54,340
I'm fine.

101
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,064
The resemblance to Vedek Bareil
is remarkable.

102
00:07:06,118 --> 00:07:08,785
Well, this is the cleanest
interrogation chamber

103
00:07:08,825 --> 00:07:10,295
I've ever been in.

104
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:13,532
And believe me,
I've been in quite a few.

105
00:07:13,572 --> 00:07:15,065
I'm glad you're comfortable.

106
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,176
Now, do you mind telling me
where you got ahold of this?

107
00:07:18,218 --> 00:07:20,885
A Terran rebel gave it to me.

108
00:07:20,926 --> 00:07:23,627
Hmm. A multidimensional
transporter device... nice gift.

109
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,036
We were very close.

110
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:28,979
So when do I get to meet myself?

111
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,348
Meaning what?

112
00:07:30,385 --> 00:07:32,950
Well, this is
the alternate universe, correct?

113
00:07:32,993 --> 00:07:35,056
Everything's the same
but different

114
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:38,404
which means there's
another Bareil Antos here.

115
00:07:38,442 --> 00:07:39,411
There was.

116
00:07:39,445 --> 00:07:40,675
Was?

117
00:07:40,781 --> 00:07:42,011
He's dead.

118
00:07:43,823 --> 00:07:45,293
You knew him, didn't you?

119
00:07:45,327 --> 00:07:49,031
Then that's why you
seemed to recognize me.

120
00:07:50,943 --> 00:07:52,379
What was he like?

121
00:07:53,651 --> 00:07:55,053
Does that really matter?

122
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,956
He was someone you cared about.

123
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:00,229
Oh...

124
00:08:00,269 --> 00:08:01,100
Major...

125
00:08:04,848 --> 00:08:08,449
I know I have no right
to ask you this

126
00:08:08,492 --> 00:08:12,265
but you could do me a big favor.

127
00:08:12,303 --> 00:08:14,001
Destroy that device.

128
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:17,607
Why?

129
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:20,990
Because then
they can't send me back.

130
00:08:21,027 --> 00:08:23,397
I'm sorry.
I can't do that.

131
00:08:23,434 --> 00:08:24,733
Please, Major.

132
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,208
You've been there.

133
00:08:27,244 --> 00:08:30,150
You know what it's like.

134
00:08:30,186 --> 00:08:32,385
Put me in prison,

135
00:08:32,426 --> 00:08:34,660
in a labor camp,
whatever you want.

136
00:08:34,699 --> 00:08:37,069
Just let me stay.

137
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:40,615
Now, let me
get this straight, Major.

138
00:08:40,648 --> 00:08:42,175
You're refusing
to press charges.

139
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:43,518
That's right.

140
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:45,187
I don't think Bareil
ever intended to hurt me.

141
00:08:45,228 --> 00:08:46,197
Well, I suppose we should

142
00:08:46,231 --> 00:08:47,701
just send him back
where he came from.

143
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,730
No. He doesn't want
to go back to that universe

144
00:08:49,774 --> 00:08:51,769
and I don't blame him.

145
00:08:51,814 --> 00:08:54,583
I know what you're
going through, Major.

146
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:56,957
When I met the other
Jennifer Sisko

147
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,934
it was very confusing,
to say the least.

148
00:08:59,969 --> 00:09:02,407
I knew she wasn't my wife

149
00:09:02,443 --> 00:09:06,751
but sometimes she would smile
at me a certain way...

150
00:09:06,788 --> 00:09:09,421
and then the light
would hit her eyes...

151
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,342
and it was my Jennifer...

152
00:09:14,376 --> 00:09:17,476
at least that's what
I wanted to believe.

153
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,715
Captain

154
00:09:18,755 --> 00:09:20,750
I know this man
is not Vedek Bareil.

155
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:23,666
He doesn't talk like him;
he doesn't act like him.

156
00:09:23,702 --> 00:09:25,570
He's a totally different person.

157
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,977
But you still feel
this connection with him

158
00:09:28,015 --> 00:09:29,314
that you can't explain,
don't you?

159
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:32,319
It's not a problem.

160
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:35,094
Good.

161
00:09:35,134 --> 00:09:37,869
Just make sure
it doesn't become one.

162
00:09:57,831 --> 00:10:00,167
Major.

163
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:04,582
I just wanted to say thank you

164
00:10:04,616 --> 00:10:06,280
for putting in
a good word for me.

165
00:10:06,321 --> 00:10:08,053
What are you going to do now?

166
00:10:08,093 --> 00:10:09,084
I'm not sure.

167
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:11,158
I've been reading up
on your world, and...

168
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:15,075
it's very different
from the Bajor I know.

169
00:10:15,112 --> 00:10:16,673
Is that where you intend to go?

170
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:18,689
Well, I'm thinking...

171
00:10:18,723 --> 00:10:20,125
about it.

172
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,926
Did you see that?

173
00:10:21,965 --> 00:10:23,902
People keep staring at me.

174
00:10:23,937 --> 00:10:26,911
It's because the man
that you look like

175
00:10:26,945 --> 00:10:30,114
was loved and respected
by a lot of people.

176
00:10:30,154 --> 00:10:31,453
He was a vedek.

177
00:10:31,492 --> 00:10:32,894
A vedek.

178
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:34,057
A religious leader.

179
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:38,037
Imagine me a religious leader.

180
00:10:38,111 --> 00:10:39,843
I'm glad you find it funny.

181
00:10:39,882 --> 00:10:42,047
I'm going to be late
for services.

182
00:10:42,088 --> 00:10:44,253
Wait. I didn't
mean to offend you.

183
00:10:44,294 --> 00:10:45,889
It's just the kind
of life I've led

184
00:10:45,932 --> 00:10:48,462
hasn't been very... spiritual.

185
00:10:48,506 --> 00:10:51,537
In fact, I don't think I've
ever been inside a temple.

186
00:10:51,581 --> 00:10:52,572
Well, now's your chance.

187
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:53,746
You're welcome to join me.

188
00:10:54,991 --> 00:10:56,255
In there?

189
00:10:56,294 --> 00:10:58,766
I don't think so.

190
00:10:58,802 --> 00:11:00,636
Besides, if I go in there

191
00:11:00,673 --> 00:11:02,941
people are going
to start believing

192
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:04,643
I really am Vedek Bareil.

193
00:11:04,684 --> 00:11:07,419
That's something
I'd like to avoid.

194
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,431
I can understand that.

195
00:11:51,883 --> 00:11:54,117
What are you doing here?

196
00:11:54,156 --> 00:11:57,187
I figured I could use
a little spiritual guidance.

197
00:11:57,231 --> 00:11:58,530
That's not funny.

198
00:11:58,568 --> 00:12:00,471
It wasn't meant to be.

199
00:12:00,507 --> 00:12:04,348
I plan on making a new
life for myself here.

200
00:12:04,385 --> 00:12:06,857
I'm going to need all
the help I can get.

201
00:12:08,496 --> 00:12:11,596
<i>Tolata impara no takash.</i>

202
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:17,477
With humility and gratitude,
we accept this gift.

203
00:12:20,597 --> 00:12:24,039
<i>Veshanoo yavar ha iktasho.</i>

204
00:12:27,282 --> 00:12:29,618
What's in the box?

205
00:12:29,655 --> 00:12:32,595
The Orb of Prophecy and Change.

206
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,191
Orb?

207
00:12:34,234 --> 00:12:36,502
A gift from the Prophets.

208
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:39,071
It can foresee the future or...

209
00:12:39,115 --> 00:12:41,553
a possible future anyway.

210
00:12:41,588 --> 00:12:42,636
Who are the Prophets?

211
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,505
Our Gods.

212
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:48,075
You do have Gods, don't you?

213
00:12:48,118 --> 00:12:50,420
Of course we do.

214
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,794
You don't sound too sure.

215
00:12:52,832 --> 00:12:55,704
That's because
I leave them alone,

216
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,472
they leave me alone.

217
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:58,502
Shh!

218
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,173
So what'd you think?

219
00:13:11,216 --> 00:13:12,515
I'm not sure.

220
00:13:12,553 --> 00:13:15,527
It... was an interesting
ceremony, but...

221
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:16,928
But what?

222
00:13:16,965 --> 00:13:19,871
Everybody seemed
to take it so seriously.

223
00:13:19,907 --> 00:13:21,970
What's wrong with that?

224
00:13:22,013 --> 00:13:25,717
I suppose it must be nice
to have that kind of faith.

225
00:13:25,757 --> 00:13:28,823
I've always preferred
to believe in nothing.

226
00:13:28,865 --> 00:13:31,099
That way
I'm never disappointed.

227
00:13:31,138 --> 00:13:34,169
Oh, that doesn't sound
like much of a life.

228
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:35,513
Maybe not...

229
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,214
but it's all mine.

230
00:13:40,297 --> 00:13:45,141
Anyway, I'm glad I had
this chance to see you again.

231
00:13:45,178 --> 00:13:47,241
It was...

232
00:13:49,256 --> 00:13:51,022
very enlightening.

233
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,159
Thank you, Major.

234
00:13:56,174 --> 00:13:57,507
Bareil.

235
00:13:58,749 --> 00:14:00,379
Do you like Klingon food?

236
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:02,918
An hour later

237
00:14:02,961 --> 00:14:05,229
the Klingon guard
returns to my cell.

238
00:14:05,267 --> 00:14:08,298
He puts down what's supposed
to be my "last" meal.

239
00:14:08,342 --> 00:14:10,314
I slip his <i>mek'leth</i>
out of its scabbard

240
00:14:10,348 --> 00:14:11,612
hide it in my shirt.

241
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:15,149
That night, I used the blade
to deactivate the sensor alarm

242
00:14:15,195 --> 00:14:17,292
my earring
to open the cell door.

243
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:19,329
By the time
they realized I was gone

244
00:14:19,373 --> 00:14:21,845
I was halfway
to the Ventar system.

245
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:25,856
That's one hell of a story.

246
00:14:25,891 --> 00:14:26,951
And that is all it is...

247
00:14:26,995 --> 00:14:27,964
a story.

248
00:14:27,998 --> 00:14:28,967
Excuse me?

249
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,367
It was well told

250
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:33,811
but there was no truth
to any of it.

251
00:14:33,847 --> 00:14:34,907
Oh, you're sure of that.

252
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,283
You want us to believe

253
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:39,421
that you stole a <i>mek'leth</i>
from a Klingon warrior.

254
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:42,129
Worf, it's not polite to
accuse the guest of lying.

255
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,970
No, it's all right.

256
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,573
Obviously, I was exaggerating.

257
00:14:47,619 --> 00:14:50,457
Would you like to do the honors?

258
00:14:50,493 --> 00:14:54,094
Mmm. Allow me.

259
00:14:57,312 --> 00:14:59,477
I believe...

260
00:14:59,518 --> 00:15:01,386
this is yours?

261
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,069
What do you

262
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,374
think now, Worf?

263
00:15:09,413 --> 00:15:11,476
Obviously,
Bareil is a better thief

264
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,217
than I gave him credit for.

265
00:15:14,728 --> 00:15:16,723
More bloodwine.

266
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:18,634
Why not?

267
00:15:22,315 --> 00:15:23,751
You are a lucky woman.

268
00:15:23,853 --> 00:15:25,152
Why is that?

269
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,162
You have good friends.

270
00:15:27,196 --> 00:15:28,632
They liked you.

271
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:30,000
You think so?

272
00:15:30,037 --> 00:15:33,068
Oh. Well, why do you
sound so surprised?

273
00:15:33,113 --> 00:15:36,144
You must have had
friends back home.

274
00:15:36,188 --> 00:15:38,285
I can think of one.

275
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,901
If you'd rather not
talk about it...

276
00:15:44,946 --> 00:15:47,441
There's not much to say.

277
00:15:47,485 --> 00:15:49,457
She died.

278
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:50,687
I'm sorry.

279
00:15:50,728 --> 00:15:52,665
It's all right.

280
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,501
It happened a long time ago.

281
00:16:06,238 --> 00:16:07,537
This is home.

282
00:16:07,576 --> 00:16:11,349
I'm sorry the evening has
to end on such a sad note.

283
00:16:11,386 --> 00:16:14,292
Would you like to come in?

284
00:16:14,328 --> 00:16:16,664
Have a <i>raktajino?</i>

285
00:16:20,712 --> 00:16:22,546
Her name was Lisea.

286
00:16:23,553 --> 00:16:26,391
I first saw her
on the street in Ilvia.

287
00:16:26,428 --> 00:16:29,300
Oh, I couldn't take
my eyes off of her.

288
00:16:29,337 --> 00:16:32,642
She had the most
attractive little...

289
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:35,653
money sack
hanging from her waist.

290
00:16:35,687 --> 00:16:37,487
Don't tell me you stole it.

291
00:16:37,525 --> 00:16:38,995
She should've known better

292
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,902
than to carry her money
so carelessly in Ilvia.

293
00:16:42,004 --> 00:16:44,637
It's a very dangerous place.

294
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:50,355
Turns out, she'd just arrived
from one of the mining camps

295
00:16:50,395 --> 00:16:52,492
in the hills of Dahkur Province.

296
00:16:52,534 --> 00:16:54,368
I come from Dahkur Province.

297
00:16:54,407 --> 00:16:56,777
Only here it's all farmland.

298
00:16:56,813 --> 00:17:00,881
When I met her, she was working
in an Ilvian pleasure center.

299
00:17:00,924 --> 00:17:03,396
And you decided to take
her away from all that.

300
00:17:03,432 --> 00:17:06,133
I taught her how to be a thief.

301
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:09,410
The funny thing is
she was so grateful.

302
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:12,082
She felt I saved her life.

303
00:17:12,122 --> 00:17:13,489
Maybe you did.

304
00:17:14,997 --> 00:17:17,664
If anyone was saved,
it was me.

305
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:22,947
We were having dinner
in a bar one night.

306
00:17:23,053 --> 00:17:25,082
A fight broke out.

307
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,925
Drunken Cardassian

308
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:30,428
pulled out his disruptor
and started firing.

309
00:17:31,878 --> 00:17:33,815
We were together five years.

310
00:17:36,257 --> 00:17:38,160
And in all that time

311
00:17:38,195 --> 00:17:40,828
I never told her
how much she meant to me.

312
00:17:52,134 --> 00:17:55,006
I know what it's
like to lose someone.

313
00:17:57,014 --> 00:18:00,855
When I activated
that transporter device

314
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:03,958
I had no idea where I'd end up.

315
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:07,671
I never thought
I'd be sitting here...

316
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,579
with you.

317
00:18:09,617 --> 00:18:12,820
Two days ago...

318
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:15,697
all I wanted was to be alone.

319
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:24,851
Major...

320
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:30,567
Don't you think it's
time you called me Nerys?

321
00:18:51,488 --> 00:18:54,485
What did you say
these were called?

322
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:58,268
Alvas.
They grow all over Bajor.

323
00:18:58,307 --> 00:19:00,336
Not my Bajor.

324
00:19:02,753 --> 00:19:06,251
I can't believe
you're still hungry.

325
00:19:06,297 --> 00:19:07,699
After a big Klingon meal

326
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:10,434
I usually don't eat
for two days.

327
00:19:10,474 --> 00:19:12,776
Ever since I got here,
I can't stop eating.

328
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,352
What is it?

329
00:19:17,394 --> 00:19:19,389
Nothing.

330
00:19:27,121 --> 00:19:30,187
This must be
very strange for you.

331
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,205
You and I here together...

332
00:19:35,244 --> 00:19:37,239
me looking like him.

333
00:19:40,392 --> 00:19:45,738
Fortunately, you're
not anything like him.

334
00:19:45,774 --> 00:19:48,178
You mean
he didn't eat in bed?

335
00:19:51,155 --> 00:19:55,497
Antos was very disciplined.

336
00:19:55,534 --> 00:19:58,805
He had a strict routine
he never deviated from.

337
00:19:58,843 --> 00:20:01,077
He only ate two meals a day.

338
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,882
Simple food.

339
00:20:02,921 --> 00:20:05,554
He used to say

340
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:07,897
"When you overindulge
the body..."

341
00:20:07,935 --> 00:20:11,104
"You starve the soul."

342
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:13,139
How did you know that?

343
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,713
I did a little research...

344
00:20:15,824 --> 00:20:17,624
enough to know
that when he died

345
00:20:17,662 --> 00:20:20,134
Bajor suffered a great loss.

346
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:27,382
I would've given...

347
00:20:27,423 --> 00:20:31,491
my life to save his.

348
00:20:31,535 --> 00:20:33,769
But all I could do
was just stand there

349
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:35,870
and watch his slip away.

350
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:49,141
Are you tired?

351
00:20:51,323 --> 00:20:53,659
Not anymore.

352
00:20:53,697 --> 00:20:56,728
Want to get an early breakfast?

353
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,215
Sounds good.

354
00:21:10,844 --> 00:21:13,374
My medical requisitions.

355
00:21:13,418 --> 00:21:14,580
Why didn't you

356
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:16,489
just download them
into the computer?

357
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:18,225
Oh, um, I don't know.

358
00:21:18,265 --> 00:21:20,737
Thought I might stretch my legs.

359
00:21:20,772 --> 00:21:22,139
See what was happening in Ops.

360
00:21:22,176 --> 00:21:24,148
Kira hasn't shown up yet.

361
00:21:24,181 --> 00:21:25,241
Kira?

362
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,050
You are so transparent.

363
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,583
What are you talking about?

364
00:21:28,627 --> 00:21:30,222
Your guilt is quite clear,
Doctor.

365
00:21:30,265 --> 00:21:31,701
Guilt? About what?

366
00:21:31,736 --> 00:21:33,263
About medical requisitions?

367
00:21:33,307 --> 00:21:34,469
Don't be ridiculous.

368
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:38,351
Julian, Kira's personal life
is her own.

369
00:21:38,388 --> 00:21:39,721
We're her friends.

370
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:41,319
We should respect her privacy.

371
00:21:41,363 --> 00:21:42,525
Good morning, Nerys.

372
00:21:42,566 --> 00:21:44,161
How'd it go last night?

373
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:45,366
You mean dinner?

374
00:21:45,408 --> 00:21:47,072
We had a great time. Why?

375
00:21:47,113 --> 00:21:48,446
Uh, she means after dinner

376
00:21:48,483 --> 00:21:50,249
but you don't have
to answer that

377
00:21:50,287 --> 00:21:52,817
because we don't want
to invade your privacy.

378
00:21:52,862 --> 00:21:55,802
But if you want to tell us
about it, we'll listen.

379
00:21:56,973 --> 00:22:00,004
It went... well.

380
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,390
I told you.

381
00:22:03,425 --> 00:22:05,863
I never doubted it.

382
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,896
Well, I, uh...

383
00:22:08,973 --> 00:22:10,773
think I should be getting
back to the Infirmary.

384
00:22:10,812 --> 00:22:14,083
Unless, um, there are
any more details forthcoming.

385
00:22:14,121 --> 00:22:15,249
Good-bye, Doctor.

386
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:16,453
Good-bye.

387
00:22:18,132 --> 00:22:21,301
Worf, any news from
General Martok's scout ships?

388
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:24,714
They report no Dominion activity
along the border.

389
00:22:24,751 --> 00:22:26,483
Let's hope it stays that way.

390
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:32,799
Are you seeing him tonight?

391
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,139
At the Bajoran shrine.

392
00:22:34,177 --> 00:22:36,810
That doesn't sound
very romantic.

393
00:22:36,851 --> 00:22:39,323
He's going to have
his first Orb experience.

394
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,988
Your idea, I suppose?

395
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:42,829
No, actually, it was his.

396
00:22:42,868 --> 00:22:45,170
He's curious about
Bajoran spirituality.

397
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:47,203
It's a new concept for him.

398
00:22:47,247 --> 00:22:50,313
Well, it's not a midnight
swim in the holosuites

399
00:22:50,355 --> 00:22:53,090
but if it makes you happy.

400
00:22:59,347 --> 00:23:01,147
So, where is this vedek?

401
00:23:01,186 --> 00:23:02,155
He'll be here.

402
00:23:02,188 --> 00:23:03,418
Now stop pacing.

403
00:23:03,459 --> 00:23:06,331
This is an Orb experience,
not an execution.

404
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:08,839
I just don't want
to disappoint anyone.

405
00:23:08,874 --> 00:23:11,346
That's sweet, but I'm
not going to judge you.

406
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:12,680
I know that.

407
00:23:12,718 --> 00:23:14,849
I meant the Prophets.

408
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:16,521
What do I say to them?

409
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,693
You don't have
to say or do anything.

410
00:23:18,735 --> 00:23:20,603
I just...

411
00:23:20,641 --> 00:23:22,373
stare into the Orb.

412
00:23:22,412 --> 00:23:25,910
Actually, it's more like
the Orb stares into you.

413
00:23:28,261 --> 00:23:31,725
Welcome, my child.

414
00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:35,839
Are you ready to proceed?

415
00:23:35,883 --> 00:23:37,878
Yes.

416
00:23:40,495 --> 00:23:43,732
Your <i>pagh</i> is strong.

417
00:23:43,771 --> 00:23:47,110
You are ready to face
the will of the Prophets.

418
00:23:49,855 --> 00:23:51,416
Come.

419
00:24:34,714 --> 00:24:36,617
Thank you. I'm...

420
00:24:36,652 --> 00:24:37,780
not hungry.

421
00:24:37,822 --> 00:24:40,853
Well, that's a change.

422
00:24:42,268 --> 00:24:45,003
When you had
your first Orb experience

423
00:24:45,042 --> 00:24:46,637
did you understand it?

424
00:24:48,185 --> 00:24:50,521
I don't know that anyone
fully understands

425
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:52,392
an Orb experience...

426
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,957
not at first anyway.

427
00:24:55,305 --> 00:24:57,972
You have to live
with it for a while.

428
00:24:58,013 --> 00:24:59,745
Absorb it.

429
00:24:59,784 --> 00:25:01,550
And then?

430
00:25:03,494 --> 00:25:07,562
And then one day, it...

431
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,205
becomes a part of you

432
00:25:10,314 --> 00:25:12,251
a part of who you are.

433
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:18,458
I thought I would get
a glimpse of the future.

434
00:25:18,502 --> 00:25:20,497
It was more than that.

435
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,149
It changes you.

436
00:25:25,188 --> 00:25:27,022
There were so many images.

437
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,932
I couldn't keep
track of them all.

438
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:33,102
He was there.

439
00:25:33,144 --> 00:25:35,116
Vedek Bareil.

440
00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:39,719
We were together, talking,
but...

441
00:25:39,763 --> 00:25:41,233
it was all mixed up.

442
00:25:41,266 --> 00:25:42,759
I-I-I was him.

443
00:25:42,804 --> 00:25:45,003
He was me.

444
00:25:47,016 --> 00:25:48,404
It's all very confusing.

445
00:25:48,537 --> 00:25:50,873
I don't think we should
be talking about this.

446
00:25:52,381 --> 00:25:54,410
If I can't tell you about it

447
00:25:54,454 --> 00:25:55,787
who can I tell?

448
00:25:55,824 --> 00:25:56,986
No one.

449
00:25:57,028 --> 00:26:00,561
An Orb experience
isn't meant to be shared.

450
00:26:04,349 --> 00:26:07,084
I feel as if I could
sleep for days.

451
00:26:07,123 --> 00:26:10,998
Well, that's
a very common reaction.

452
00:26:11,034 --> 00:26:12,834
Why don't you get some rest?

453
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:15,174
I will.

454
00:26:15,212 --> 00:26:16,442
Nerys...

455
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:24,533
It's all right.

456
00:26:26,744 --> 00:26:28,909
I'll see you tomorrow.

457
00:26:56,595 --> 00:26:59,067
I was wondering
when you'd get back.

458
00:26:59,101 --> 00:27:01,232
What are you doing here?

459
00:27:01,274 --> 00:27:03,177
I know.

460
00:27:03,213 --> 00:27:04,740
I'm early.

461
00:27:04,784 --> 00:27:07,918
But my curiosity
got the better of me.

462
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:12,438
Besides, the thought
of you pining away for me

463
00:27:12,472 --> 00:27:14,306
was too much to bear.

464
00:27:18,824 --> 00:27:22,095
Now, tell me...

465
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:25,974
how's our little plan
progressing?

466
00:27:26,009 --> 00:27:27,479
Couldn't be better.

467
00:27:27,514 --> 00:27:29,748
Right on schedule.

468
00:27:29,787 --> 00:27:32,522
That's just what
I was hoping to hear.

469
00:27:41,754 --> 00:27:43,018
Now...

470
00:27:43,124 --> 00:27:46,190
tell me everything
that's happened

471
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:47,931
since you got here.

472
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:49,031
Mmm, later.

473
00:27:49,141 --> 00:27:50,543
I'm too tired.

474
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:52,881
Right now, all I want
to do is go to bed.

475
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:54,081
Mmm. Even better.

476
00:27:55,358 --> 00:27:57,796
I said I was tired.

477
00:27:57,833 --> 00:28:00,534
You've never been tired before.

478
00:28:00,574 --> 00:28:02,773
It's been a long day.

479
00:28:06,356 --> 00:28:09,456
I don't think you're pleased
to see me.

480
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,502
Oh, it's her, isn't it?

481
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:20,819
The Major's gotten to you.

482
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,062
Don't be stupid.

483
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:24,970
Oh, I'd be disappointed

484
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:28,348
if you didn't find
the Major intoxicating.

485
00:28:28,385 --> 00:28:30,823
I mean, after all, she is me...

486
00:28:30,858 --> 00:28:33,092
or the next best thing to me.

487
00:28:33,164 --> 00:28:34,964
So...

488
00:28:35,002 --> 00:28:36,734
what did you think of her?

489
00:28:36,775 --> 00:28:38,575
You are crazy.

490
00:28:38,613 --> 00:28:41,610
Oh, we know what I'm like.

491
00:28:41,654 --> 00:28:43,488
What about her?

492
00:28:43,527 --> 00:28:45,361
I am not going to discuss this.

493
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:47,370
Oh, please.

494
00:28:47,404 --> 00:28:48,668
Please.

495
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:50,508
I really want to know.

496
00:28:54,323 --> 00:28:55,918
She's wonderful.

497
00:29:05,822 --> 00:29:07,452
Mmm.

498
00:29:11,538 --> 00:29:13,669
Oh, I knew it...

499
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:16,685
but she's too good for you.

500
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:18,850
We both are.

501
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:22,356
I mean, you're nothing
but a petty thief.

502
00:29:22,402 --> 00:29:24,100
I know what I am.

503
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,542
That's it?

504
00:29:25,577 --> 00:29:27,947
That's all you have to say?

505
00:29:27,984 --> 00:29:29,716
I said I was tired.

506
00:29:29,756 --> 00:29:30,725
Oh, Major Kira must...

507
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:34,166
This has nothing to do
with the Major. I...

508
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:38,675
I looked...

509
00:29:38,714 --> 00:29:40,548
into the Orb today.

510
00:29:40,586 --> 00:29:42,558
You did?

511
00:29:42,592 --> 00:29:46,399
Oh, how very exciting.

512
00:29:50,647 --> 00:29:51,673
So...

513
00:29:51,717 --> 00:29:54,452
how soon can we
get our hands on it?

514
00:29:54,491 --> 00:29:58,229
The vedeks are holding
a 26-hour vigil in the shrine.

515
00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:02,076
Now, I cannot get near the place
until tomorrow night.

516
00:30:02,113 --> 00:30:04,916
The Orb is
behind a force field keyed

517
00:30:04,954 --> 00:30:06,048
to a decryption matrix.

518
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:08,620
Oh, which you can bypass.

519
00:30:08,665 --> 00:30:10,397
That's what thieves do.

520
00:30:10,436 --> 00:30:11,838
Oh...

521
00:30:11,874 --> 00:30:14,541
today you're a thief

522
00:30:14,581 --> 00:30:16,313
but tomorrow...

523
00:30:16,353 --> 00:30:20,559
once we bring our prize home...

524
00:30:20,598 --> 00:30:23,470
you'll be
the Bearer of the Orb...

525
00:30:23,505 --> 00:30:27,973
the holy man who unites
the Bajoran people

526
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:30,514
in a war against the Alliance.

527
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,861
Just call me Vedek Bareil.

528
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:36,169
Think of it...
the wealth, the power.

529
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:38,271
You'll be like a god.

530
00:30:38,314 --> 00:30:41,881
You're putting a lot of faith
in that Orb.

531
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:43,792
So will every other Bajoran.

532
00:30:46,904 --> 00:30:49,103
Oh, we're going to have
such fun.

533
00:30:49,144 --> 00:30:50,408
I can hardly wait.

534
00:30:51,918 --> 00:30:53,080
You do look tired.

535
00:30:53,122 --> 00:30:54,752
You should get some rest.

536
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:04,382
And tomorrow...

537
00:31:04,454 --> 00:31:06,858
when you see the Major...

538
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:15,279
give her that...

539
00:31:15,318 --> 00:31:16,617
for me.

540
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,859
Sleep well.

541
00:31:41,223 --> 00:31:42,750
One more.

542
00:31:42,794 --> 00:31:44,789
Coming right up.

543
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,770
What are you two looking at?

544
00:31:53,557 --> 00:31:55,118
Same goes for the rest of you.

545
00:31:55,162 --> 00:31:57,795
I am not Vedek Bareil.

546
00:32:00,009 --> 00:32:02,208
I just want to be left alone.

547
00:32:02,249 --> 00:32:04,744
You heard the man.
Now, leave him be.

548
00:32:04,788 --> 00:32:06,281
Sorry about that.

549
00:32:06,326 --> 00:32:07,488
People can be so rude.

550
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:10,630
You know, I used to see
the vedek all the time

551
00:32:10,672 --> 00:32:13,806
walking down the Promenade
with Major Kira.

552
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,820
Never came in here, though.

553
00:32:15,853 --> 00:32:19,420
I guess dabo wasn't his game.

554
00:32:19,463 --> 00:32:21,958
It's an amazing resemblance.

555
00:32:22,003 --> 00:32:23,063
Put you in a vedek's robe

556
00:32:23,106 --> 00:32:24,701
and nobody would know
the difference.

557
00:32:24,744 --> 00:32:28,049
Believe me,
there's a difference.

558
00:32:30,595 --> 00:32:32,624
But not to the paying public.

559
00:32:33,769 --> 00:32:36,572
You have a business
proposition for me?

560
00:32:36,645 --> 00:32:38,582
Well, spit it out.

561
00:32:40,088 --> 00:32:41,490
Picture this.

562
00:32:41,524 --> 00:32:43,519
You seated here wearing robes

563
00:32:43,564 --> 00:32:45,968
a long line of Bajorans
waiting patiently

564
00:32:46,004 --> 00:32:48,264
to pay good money
just to meet Vedek Bareil...

565
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:50,232
maybe touch his hand.

566
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:54,236
Like I said,
I'm not Vedek Bareil.

567
00:32:54,281 --> 00:32:56,549
A mere technicality.

568
00:32:56,587 --> 00:32:58,080
You're the closest thing
to Vedek Bareil

569
00:32:58,125 --> 00:32:59,094
they're ever going to see

570
00:32:59,128 --> 00:33:00,621
which is why
they're going to love you.

571
00:33:00,666 --> 00:33:03,002
I wouldn't know what to say.

572
00:33:04,008 --> 00:33:05,945
The less the better.

573
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:10,288
Just nod every once in a while
and smile... benignly.

574
00:33:10,393 --> 00:33:11,760
It's very simple.

575
00:33:11,797 --> 00:33:13,996
Later on, once you get
the hang of it

576
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:16,474
you might even throw in
a blessing or two.

577
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,946
What do you think?

578
00:33:19,284 --> 00:33:23,888
I've known people like
you my whole life...

579
00:33:23,931 --> 00:33:25,731
nasty, greedy little minds

580
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:30,943
willing to do whatever it takes
to make money.

581
00:33:30,983 --> 00:33:33,319
I know just how you think.

582
00:33:33,357 --> 00:33:36,195
That's because you
think the same way.

583
00:33:43,886 --> 00:33:46,655
I suppose I am
a lot more like you

584
00:33:46,694 --> 00:33:49,327
than I'll ever be like...

585
00:33:49,368 --> 00:33:51,032
Vedek Bareil.

586
00:33:51,073 --> 00:33:52,064
Perfect.

587
00:33:52,109 --> 00:33:54,274
Then we have a deal?

588
00:33:56,087 --> 00:33:57,420
I'm afraid not.

589
00:33:57,491 --> 00:33:58,585
Why?

590
00:33:58,628 --> 00:34:00,496
Because right now

591
00:34:00,533 --> 00:34:02,732
I don't like either one of us.

592
00:34:11,263 --> 00:34:12,391
It's a shame to see

593
00:34:12,466 --> 00:34:15,566
such a perfect opportunity
go to waste.

594
00:34:48,266 --> 00:34:52,677
Major, any idea where they put
my shipment of Saurian brandy?

595
00:34:52,712 --> 00:34:54,045
Over there.

596
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:55,713
You heard her.

597
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:01,768
Your new boyfriend
came into my bar today.

598
00:35:01,804 --> 00:35:02,932
Oh, did he?

599
00:35:02,974 --> 00:35:05,812
He's... a little
different, isn't he?

600
00:35:05,849 --> 00:35:07,011
From what?

601
00:35:07,052 --> 00:35:09,890
From some
of your previous choices.

602
00:35:09,927 --> 00:35:11,761
Don't get me wrong.

603
00:35:11,798 --> 00:35:15,103
I had nothing against
Vedek Bareil or Shakaar

604
00:35:15,141 --> 00:35:17,944
but they were
a little too controlled...

605
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:19,817
a little too controlling.

606
00:35:19,855 --> 00:35:22,327
They lacked fire, excitement

607
00:35:22,361 --> 00:35:24,960
but this Bareil...
he's different.

608
00:35:25,002 --> 00:35:26,335
He's full of surprises.

609
00:35:26,373 --> 00:35:28,071
Oh, so I take it
that you like him.

610
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,416
Let's just say

611
00:35:31,454 --> 00:35:34,155
I like the idea of you with him.

612
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:39,373
But let me tell you
something, Major.

613
00:35:39,409 --> 00:35:40,902
You'd better brace yourself.

614
00:35:40,947 --> 00:35:42,440
You're in for a rough ride.

615
00:35:42,485 --> 00:35:44,080
Oh, what are you talking about?

616
00:35:44,122 --> 00:35:47,062
I've been a bartender
for a long time.

617
00:35:47,097 --> 00:35:49,798
I've seen all sorts
of customers...

618
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,745
sad ones, happy ones,
complicated ones.

619
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,775
Uh-huh, and Bareil...
where does he fit in?

620
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,816
He's one of the tormented ones.

621
00:35:57,861 --> 00:35:59,729
Tormented?

622
00:35:59,766 --> 00:36:01,099
No, I don't think so.

623
00:36:01,136 --> 00:36:03,404
Quark, you've had
an Orb experience.

624
00:36:03,443 --> 00:36:05,004
You know what it's like.

625
00:36:05,047 --> 00:36:09,424
Mmm... he had an Orb experience.

626
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,429
Interesting.

627
00:36:10,463 --> 00:36:12,058
Oh, meaning what?

628
00:36:12,101 --> 00:36:13,468
After he left the bar

629
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:16,342
I saw him hanging around
the Bajoran shrine.

630
00:36:16,379 --> 00:36:18,374
He must have been there
a couple of hours.

631
00:36:18,418 --> 00:36:19,717
Well, he has a lot on his mind.

632
00:36:19,756 --> 00:36:21,693
He probably went there
to think things over.

633
00:36:22,697 --> 00:36:24,726
Either that...

634
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:28,007
or he was figuring out a way
to rob the place.

635
00:36:29,582 --> 00:36:31,577
What's this?
A union meeting?

636
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:34,094
Let's get going.

637
00:36:34,128 --> 00:36:36,532
Nice chatting with you, Major.

638
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,369
I hope you two...

639
00:36:38,407 --> 00:36:40,402
are very happy together.

640
00:36:53,717 --> 00:36:56,155
Well, what do you think?

641
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:59,723
Even I'd have trouble
telling you apart.

642
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:02,673
Wearing the Major's clothes...

643
00:37:02,742 --> 00:37:04,542
it feels so intimate.

644
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,575
Oh, admit it.

645
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,683
You've never found me
more exciting.

646
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:12,132
It's like having
the best of both worlds.

647
00:37:12,169 --> 00:37:14,938
Let's try to stay focused,
all right?

648
00:37:14,976 --> 00:37:16,708
We both have jobs to do.

649
00:37:16,748 --> 00:37:17,717
You're right.

650
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,151
We'll celebrate later.

651
00:37:19,188 --> 00:37:20,783
Did you get the com badges?

652
00:37:21,962 --> 00:37:24,332
Ooh, what nimble fingers.

653
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:27,742
Contact me the minute
you have the Orb.

654
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:30,013
Right.

655
00:37:30,052 --> 00:37:33,790
You're going to look
so good wearing a crown.

656
00:38:13,373 --> 00:38:14,569
Everything quiet?

657
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:15,670
Yes, Major.

658
00:38:15,713 --> 00:38:16,909
Good.

659
00:38:16,949 --> 00:38:18,043
I'm sorry.

660
00:38:18,086 --> 00:38:19,750
I need your level-6
authorization code.

661
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:22,126
Oh, is that really necessary?

662
00:38:22,163 --> 00:38:23,997
It's the new protocol...
the war?

663
00:38:24,036 --> 00:38:26,669
Of course.

664
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,575
Is everything all right?

665
00:38:29,618 --> 00:38:32,615
I must've pulled a muscle
exercising in the holosuites.

666
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:36,033
It's been bothering me all day.

667
00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:39,670
Would you mind massaging
my shoulders for me?

668
00:38:40,716 --> 00:38:43,554
I could make it an order.

669
00:38:45,128 --> 00:38:48,729
Mmm. A little harder, please.

670
00:38:48,771 --> 00:38:51,438
Ooh, such strong hands.

671
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:55,217
If only we had
some warm Somata oil.

672
00:38:55,256 --> 00:38:57,124
That would be nice, wouldn't it?

673
00:38:57,161 --> 00:38:58,961
I guess.

674
00:39:02,577 --> 00:39:05,814
You have a lot to learn
about giving a massage.

675
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:39,770
What's that old saying?

676
00:39:39,814 --> 00:39:41,478
Once a thief?

677
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:43,991
What are you doing here?

678
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,555
The question is:
What are you doing here?

679
00:39:48,137 --> 00:39:49,539
Nerys?

680
00:39:53,953 --> 00:39:55,320
How did you know?

681
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:56,851
I didn't.

682
00:39:56,896 --> 00:39:59,631
You had me completely fooled.

683
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:02,040
The thief
in search of redemption.

684
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,876
Who could resist that?

685
00:40:03,915 --> 00:40:06,718
Obviously, not me.

686
00:40:06,756 --> 00:40:09,993
Luckily, Quark didn't
fall for your little act.

687
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,231
Now, step away from the altar.

688
00:40:12,271 --> 00:40:15,610
I wish I could, but I can't.

689
00:40:17,352 --> 00:40:19,084
I've come too far.

690
00:40:19,158 --> 00:40:22,691
Then you came a long way
for nothing.

691
00:40:22,734 --> 00:40:23,778
Nerys.

692
00:40:23,911 --> 00:40:27,684
Oh, you look
as beautiful as ever.

693
00:40:33,572 --> 00:40:35,544
You're just full
of surprises, aren't you?

694
00:40:35,644 --> 00:40:36,840
Well, it's only fair.

695
00:40:36,882 --> 00:40:39,047
You had your Bareil;
I have mine.

696
00:40:39,087 --> 00:40:42,551
You were supposed to wait for me
at the transporter pad.

697
00:40:42,631 --> 00:40:44,192
Oh, don't worry.

698
00:40:44,235 --> 00:40:46,765
I have the transporter
keyed to this control.

699
00:40:46,808 --> 00:40:50,045
All I have to do is tap this key

700
00:40:50,084 --> 00:40:51,884
and we're on our way home.

701
00:40:51,924 --> 00:40:56,996
Besides, I couldn't leave
without saying hello to myself.

702
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,770
The transporter sensors

703
00:40:58,809 --> 00:41:01,145
showed that you weren't
alone in the shrine

704
00:41:01,182 --> 00:41:03,119
and I was hoping
it was you, Nerys.

705
00:41:03,155 --> 00:41:04,317
Bareil's smart

706
00:41:04,358 --> 00:41:05,953
but you're smarter.

707
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:08,264
We really are alike, aren't we?

708
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:09,795
You can't let her have the Orb.

709
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,809
It's too dangerous.

710
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,940
Will you stop
wasting your breath?

711
00:41:12,982 --> 00:41:15,751
Antos and I are a team.

712
00:41:15,789 --> 00:41:18,695
We're destined to do
great things together.

713
00:41:18,732 --> 00:41:20,498
If we're going, let's go.

714
00:41:20,536 --> 00:41:21,800
You don't have to do this.

715
00:41:22,843 --> 00:41:24,711
Oh, isn't that sweet?

716
00:41:24,749 --> 00:41:26,846
She is still trying
to save your soul.

717
00:41:26,887 --> 00:41:29,452
Of course, you don't have one.

718
00:41:29,495 --> 00:41:30,794
She's right.

719
00:41:30,831 --> 00:41:32,928
I'm not worth saving.

720
00:41:32,971 --> 00:41:34,943
You sound pretty certain
of that.

721
00:41:34,977 --> 00:41:36,139
Look at him.

722
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,451
Really... look at him.

723
00:41:39,489 --> 00:41:43,557
It's important that you see him
for what he truly is.

724
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,970
I do.

725
00:41:46,008 --> 00:41:47,774
So...

726
00:41:47,813 --> 00:41:51,118
you were just using me
to get to the Orb.

727
00:41:51,155 --> 00:41:53,491
Is that what I'm supposed
to believe?

728
00:41:53,528 --> 00:41:55,226
Believe anything you want.

729
00:41:55,266 --> 00:41:57,831
Please, Nerys,
don't embarrass yourself.

730
00:41:57,874 --> 00:41:59,937
You made a mistake.

731
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,644
You let Bareil
make a fool of you.

732
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:02,847
That's bad enough.

733
00:42:02,888 --> 00:42:04,985
Don't make it worse
by denying what happened.

734
00:42:05,027 --> 00:42:07,762
Just accept it and move on.

735
00:42:07,802 --> 00:42:09,797
Why should I?

736
00:42:09,841 --> 00:42:11,436
It's not true.

737
00:42:11,478 --> 00:42:13,142
You know that as well as I do.

738
00:42:13,184 --> 00:42:15,679
You may have come here
for the Orb

739
00:42:15,724 --> 00:42:17,855
but you found something else.

740
00:42:17,897 --> 00:42:20,392
And people say
that I have a large ego.

741
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:21,463
Tell her, Antos.

742
00:42:21,506 --> 00:42:23,535
Tell her how you were using her

743
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:25,551
that everything you
told her was a lie

744
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:27,716
that every time you touched her

745
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:30,161
all you could think about
was me.

746
00:42:32,537 --> 00:42:33,528
Oh...

747
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:40,557
When she wakes up, I'll have
a lot of explaining to do.

748
00:42:40,594 --> 00:42:43,568
And if you don't have the Orb,
she'll kill you.

749
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,368
Maybe.

750
00:42:45,406 --> 00:42:48,904
That'll certainly be
her first reaction

751
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:53,327
but I've talked my way back
into her good graces before.

752
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:54,924
I'll be all right.

753
00:42:56,404 --> 00:42:58,899
I guess this is good-bye.

754
00:42:58,945 --> 00:43:01,440
It's for the best.

755
00:43:08,471 --> 00:43:12,380
You know what I saw
when I looked into that Orb?

756
00:43:14,755 --> 00:43:16,157
You and me...

757
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:17,457
together...

758
00:43:17,496 --> 00:43:19,730
on Bajor.

759
00:43:19,769 --> 00:43:22,003
We had a life...

760
00:43:22,042 --> 00:43:23,512
a family.

761
00:43:23,547 --> 00:43:25,519
What's wrong with that?

762
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:29,585
Nothing.

763
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:32,263
Might even work...

764
00:43:32,305 --> 00:43:33,399
for a while.

765
00:43:33,441 --> 00:43:35,845
But eventually,
I'd find some way

766
00:43:35,948 --> 00:43:37,281
to ruin it.

767
00:43:40,293 --> 00:43:42,322
I'm a thief.

768
00:43:45,408 --> 00:43:47,642
I belong with her.

769
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,250
Then you should go.
