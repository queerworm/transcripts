1
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,049
What about Captain Boday?
Captain Boday?

2
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:11,094
You want me to bring
Captain Boday to your
quarters for dinner?

3
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:14,556
It's just a suggestion.
It's a bad suggestion.

4
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,684
Number one,<i> you</i> used
to go out with Captain Boday;

5
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:18,727
number two, Worf hates him;
and number three--

6
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,855
and we've discussed this
<i>many times--</i>

7
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:23,732
Captain Boday has
a transparent skull.

8
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,861
And you don't like
to see a man's brains.

9
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:27,903
Ops.

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,241
What about Dr. Trag'tok?

11
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:36,787
He's intelligent;
he has a good physique...

12
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:40,248
and he has
a very opaque cranium.

13
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,960
True,
but his eye bothers me.

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,961
Which one?

15
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,004
The middle one.

16
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:46,881
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Oh, really.

17
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:48,966
You are so obsessed
with appearances.

18
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:52,302
And sometimes your taste
in men frightens me.

19
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,137
I'll make sure
to tell Worf you said so.

20
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,263
WORF:
Tell me what?

21
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,140
Don't be so nosy.

22
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,227
Hmm. You could always
invite Odo as a friend.

23
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,729
(<i> sighs</i> )

24
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,898
I'm not ready for that;
Odo's not ready for that.

25
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:06,441
Let's just forget that
you brought<i> that</i> one up.

26
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,944
Two<i> raktajinos,</i>
extra-strong, and a<i> kavaroll.</i>

27
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:12,072
I'm coming to dinner
alone, got it?

28
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,534
I got it.
Three place settings.

29
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:16,994
I'll bring the wine.

30
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,247
(<i> console beeping</i> )

31
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,498
Captain,
you better get out here.

32
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:25,586
What is it?

33
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,838
I'm showing a power buildup
in the transporter buffer.

34
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,673
Someone's attempting
to beam into Ops.

35
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:30,632
From where?

36
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,091
I don't know.

37
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,385
There are no ships
within transporter range.

38
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,232
Are you hurt?

39
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,568
No.

40
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,986
But you'll be

41
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,321
unless you do
exactly what I say.

42
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,411
It can't be.

43
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,739
What do you want?

44
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,992
A fast ship
would be nice.

45
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,499
Security...

46
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,585
we have a hostage situation.

47
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,795
Clear a path
to Landing Pad A.

48
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:17,298
Authorization:
Sisko-seven-one-green.

49
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,299
ODO:
<i>Seven-one-green.</i>

50
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,552
<i>Acknowledged, Captain.</i>

51
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,470
Your runabout's waiting.

52
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,098
Let's go.

53
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,391
If you hurt her,

54
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,851
you will never
leave this station.

55
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,519
I promise you that.

56
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,897
Follow me, and she dies--
I promise<i> you</i> that.

57
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:32,898
Hold it!

58
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:49,081
Ah-ah.
Not the turbolift.

59
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:53,127
Someone might cut the power,
and we'd be trapped inside.

60
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,335
Then we walk.

61
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:12,687
Your, uh, uniform...

62
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,023
I've never seen
one like it.

63
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:18,359
You're not with the
Alliance, are you?

64
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:21,155
There is no Alliance here.

65
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:24,158
Then I<i> have</i> crossed
into the alternate universe.

66
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:29,329
Tell you one thing.
The food's better.

67
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,124
So, I take it you're running
from the Alliance.

68
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,876
Now you know the
story of my life.

69
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,253
So, once you get
your ship, what then?

70
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,088
Believe me,
wherever I end up

71
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,798
is going to be
a lot better

72
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,175
than where I've been.

73
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,383
I can believe that.

74
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,886
I've spent some time
in your universe.

75
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,848
I'll bet you were
glad to leave it.

76
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,266
Now which way?

77
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,391
That way.

78
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,276
How many levels before
we reach the landing pad?

79
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:00,568
Fifty-seven.

80
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,154
(<i> groaning</i> )
Oh...

81
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,414
Here we are.

82
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,250
Landing Pad A.

83
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,335
(<i> sighs</i> )

84
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:17,919
Open it.

85
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,922
I've got a better idea.

86
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,883
Why don't you hand
over that disruptor?

87
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,969
Oh, you've been
so cooperative up to now.

88
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,679
I'd<i> hate</i>
to have to kill you.

89
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,223
You're not going
to kill me.

90
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,307
Oh, you sure of that?

91
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,558
You're not going
to kill anyone--

92
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,976
not with that disruptor.

93
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,978
Power cell's cracked.

94
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,691
How long have you known?
Since we left Ops.

95
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,610
Then... why
did you come with me?

96
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,197
I needed the exercise.

97
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:46,740
And I have to get away.

98
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:54,915
You all right, Major?

99
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:55,999
I'm fine.

100
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:00,670
The resemblance
to Vedek Bareil

101
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,256
is remarkable.

102
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:10,055
Well, this is the cleanest
interrogation chamber

103
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,639
I've ever been in.

104
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,684
And believe me,
I've been in quite a few.

105
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,186
I'm glad
you're comfortable.

106
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,771
Now, do you mind
telling me

107
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,273
where you got ahold
of this?

108
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,108
A Terran rebel
gave it to me.

109
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:24,861
Hmm. A multidimensional
transporter device-- nice gift.

110
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,364
We were very close.

111
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,950
So when do I get
to meet myself?

112
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,576
Meaning what?

113
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,121
Well, this<i> is</i>
the alternate
universe, correct?

114
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,164
Everything's the
same but different

115
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:39,584
which means
there's another
Bareil Antos here.

116
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,585
There was.

117
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,962
Was?

118
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,088
He's dead.

119
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,507
You knew him, didn't you?

120
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:50,095
Then that's why you
seemed to recognize me.

121
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,514
What was he like?

122
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,143
Does that really matter?

123
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,980
He was someone you cared about.

124
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,231
Oh...

125
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,274
Major...

126
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:09,697
I know I have no right
to ask you this,

127
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:13,410
but you could do me a big favor.

128
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,120
Destroy that device.

129
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:18,748
Why?

130
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,169
Because then
they can't send me back.

131
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,587
I'm sorry.
I can't do that.

132
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,047
Please, Major.

133
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,342
You've been there.

134
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,051
You know what it's like.

135
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,472
Put me in prison,

136
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:35,890
in a labor camp,
whatever you want.

137
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,267
Just let me stay.

138
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:41,729
Now, let me
get this straight, Major.

139
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,231
You're refusing
to press charges.

140
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,816
That's right.

141
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,276
I don't think Bareil
ever intended to hurt me.

142
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,527
Well, I suppose
we should

143
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,862
just send him back
where he came from.

144
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:49,904
No. He doesn't want

145
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:50,905
to go back
to that universe

146
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,949
and I don't blame him.

147
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,785
I know what you're
going through, Major.

148
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,246
When I met the other
Jennifer Sisko,

149
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:01,166
it was very confusing,
to say the least.

150
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,793
I knew she wasn't my wife,

151
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:07,964
but sometimes she would smile
at me a certain way...

152
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,675
and then the light
would hit her eyes...

153
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,722
and it<i> was</i> my Jennifer--

154
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,725
at least that's what
I wanted to believe.

155
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:19,934
Captain,

156
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,145
I know this man
is not Vedek Bareil.

157
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,981
He doesn't talk like him;
he doesn't act like him.

158
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,774
He's a totally different person.

159
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,194
But you still feel
this connection with him

160
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,529
that you can't explain,
don't you?

161
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,073
It's not a problem.

162
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,326
Good.

163
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,953
Just make sure
it doesn't become one.

164
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:00,934
Major.

165
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:06,064
I just wanted
to say thank you

166
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,732
for putting in
a good word for me.

167
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,150
What are you going to do now?

168
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,610
I'm not sure.

169
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,571
I've been reading up
on your world, and...

170
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,155
(<i> chuckling</i> )

171
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,491
it's very different
from the Bajor I know.

172
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,159
Is that where you intend to go?

173
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,953
Well, I'm thinking...

174
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,538
about it.

175
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,457
Did you see that?

176
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:26,918
People keep
staring at me.

177
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,420
It's because the man
that you look like

178
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,506
was loved and respected
by a lot of people.

179
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:32,924
He was a vedek.

180
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,175
A vedek.

181
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,385
A religious leader.

182
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,262
(<i> laughing</i> )

183
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,389
Imagine me a religious leader.

184
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,266
I'm glad you find it funny.

185
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,601
I'm going to be late
for services.

186
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:45,686
Wait. I didn't
mean to offend you.

187
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,272
It's just the kind
of life I've led

188
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,941
hasn't been very...
spiritual.

189
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,902
In fact, I don't think I've
ever been inside a temple.

190
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:53,903
Well, now's your chance.

191
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,029
You're welcome to join me.

192
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,574
In there?

193
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,243
I don't think so.

194
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,036
Besides, if I go in there,

195
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,289
people are going
to start believing

196
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,040
I really<i> am</i> Vedek Bareil.

197
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,876
That's something
I'd like to avoid.

198
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,878
I can understand that.

199
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,756
(<i> chimes tinkling</i> )

200
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:55,465
(<i> whispering</i> ):
What are you doing here?

201
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:56,591
I figured
I could use

202
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,510
a little spiritual
guidance.

203
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,886
That's not funny.

204
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,013
It wasn't meant to be.

205
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:05,892
I plan on making a new
life for myself here.

206
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,395
I'm going to need all
the help I can get.

207
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,854
(<i> soft music playing</i> )

208
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:13,774
<i>Tolata impara no takash.</i>

209
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:18,737
With humility and gratitude,
we accept this gift.

210
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:25,412
<i>Veshanoo yavar ha iktasho.</i>

211
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,084
What's in the box?

212
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:34,087
The Orb of Prophecy
and Change.

213
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,547
Orb?

214
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,965
A gift from the Prophets.

215
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,634
It can foresee the future or...

216
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,512
a possible future anyway.

217
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,347
Who are the Prophets?

218
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,392
Our Gods.

219
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,936
You<i> do</i> have Gods, don't you?

220
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,272
Of course we do.

221
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,442
You don't sound too sure.

222
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:58,319
That's because
I leave them alone,

223
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,196
they leave me alone.
Shh!

224
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,791
So what'd you think?

225
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,461
I'm not sure.

226
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,338
It... was an interesting
ceremony, but...

227
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,757
But what?

228
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:21,635
Everybody seemed
to take it so seriously.

229
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,802
What's wrong with that?

230
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:27,682
I suppose it must be nice
to have that kind of faith.

231
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,518
I've always preferred
to believe in nothing.

232
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,771
That way
I'm never disappointed.

233
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,774
Oh, that doesn't sound
like much of a life.

234
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,150
Maybe not...

235
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,817
but it's all mine.

236
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:45,575
Anyway, I'm glad I had
this chance to see you again.

237
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,869
It was...

238
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,540
very enlightening.

239
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,710
Thank you, Major.

240
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,130
Bareil.

241
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,966
Do you like Klingon food?

242
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,594
An hour later,

243
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:06,929
the Klingon guard
returns to my cell.

244
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,016
He puts down what's supposed
to be my "last" meal.

245
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,726
I slip his<i> mek'leth</i>
out of its scabbard,

246
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,478
hide it in my shirt.

247
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:16,939
That night, I used the blade
to deactivate the sensor alarm,

248
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,108
my earring
to open the cell door.

249
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,110
By the time
they realized I was gone,

250
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,571
I was halfway
to the Ventar system.

251
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,490
(<i> both laughing</i> )

252
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,617
That's one hell
of a story.

253
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:28,743
And that is<i> all</i> it is--

254
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:29,744
a story.

255
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:30,745
Excuse me?

256
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,121
It was well told

257
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,249
but there was no truth
to any of it.

258
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,250
Oh, you're sure of that.

259
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,960
WORF:
You want us to believe

260
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,130
that you stole a<i> mek'leth</i>
from a Klingon warrior.

261
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,758
Worf, it's not polite
to accuse the guest of lying.

262
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:44,925
BAREIL:
No, it's all right.

263
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:48,262
Obviously,
I was exaggerating.

264
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,099
Would you like
to do the honors?

265
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,143
Mmm. Allow me.

266
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,108
I believe...

267
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,569
this is yours?

268
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,202
What do you
think now, Worf?

269
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,413
Obviously,
Bareil is a better thief

270
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,873
than I gave him credit for.

271
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,543
More bloodwine.

272
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,420
Why not?

273
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,633
You are a
lucky woman.

274
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,926
Why is that?

275
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,053
You have
good friends.

276
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,388
They liked you.

277
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:31,848
You think so?

278
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,934
Oh. Well, why do you
sound so surprised?

279
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,477
You must have had
friends back home.

280
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,980
I can think of one.

281
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:46,696
If you'd rather not
talk about it...

282
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:49,156
There's not much to say.

283
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,117
She died.

284
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,368
I'm sorry.

285
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,621
It's all right.

286
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,205
It happened
a long time ago.

287
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,469
This is home.

288
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,012
I'm sorry the evening has
to end on such a sad note.

289
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:17,143
Would you like to come in?
Have a<i> raktajino?</i>

290
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,317
Her name was Lisea.

291
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,279
I first saw her
on the street in Ilvia.

292
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,198
Oh, I couldn't take
my eyes off of her.

293
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,577
She had the most
attractive little...

294
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,830
money sack
hanging from her waist.

295
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,373
Don't tell me
you stole it.

296
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,041
She should've known better

297
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,753
than to carry her money
so carelessly in Ilvia.

298
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,547
It's a very dangerous place.

299
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:50,885
Turns out, she'd just arrived
from one of the mining camps

300
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,179
in the hills
of Dahkur Province.

301
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,181
I come from
Dahkur Province.

302
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,726
Only here it's all farmland.

303
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:02,396
When I met her, she was working
in an Ilvian pleasure center.

304
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,316
And you decided to take
her away from all that.

305
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,986
I taught her
how to be a thief.

306
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:11,405
The funny thing is
she was so grateful.

307
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,950
She felt I saved her life.

308
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,035
Maybe you did.

309
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,705
If anyone was saved,
it was me.

310
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,709
We were having dinner
in a bar one night.

311
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,212
A fight broke out.

312
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,214
Drunken Cardassian

313
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:31,384
pulled out his disruptor
and started firing.

314
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,804
We were together five years.

315
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,433
And in all that time,

316
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,019
I never told her
how much she meant to me.

317
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,075
I know what it's
like to lose someone.

318
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:02,081
When I activated
that transporter device,

319
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,084
I had no idea where I'd end up.

320
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,755
I never thought
I'd be sitting here...

321
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,882
with you.

322
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:12,258
Two days ago...

323
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,763
all I wanted was to be alone.

324
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,980
Major...

325
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,818
Don't you think it's
time you called me Nerys?

326
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,508
What did you say
these were called?

327
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:59,597
Alvas. They grow
all over Bajor.

328
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,682
Not my Bajor.

329
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:07,688
I can't believe
you're still hungry.

330
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,148
After a big Klingon meal,

331
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,859
I usually don't eat
for two days.

332
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,112
Ever since I got here,
I can't stop eating.

333
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,825
What is it?

334
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,618
Nothing.

335
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:31,504
This must be very
strange for you.

336
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:36,509
You and I here together...

337
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,552
me looking like him.

338
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:47,061
Fortunately, you're
not anything like him.

339
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,438
You mean
he didn't eat in bed?

340
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:56,904
Antos was very
disciplined.

341
00:19:56,904 --> 00:20:00,116
He had a strict routine
he never deviated from.

342
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,242
He only ate
two meals a day.

343
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,953
Simple food.

344
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,747
He used to say

345
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,291
"When you overindulge
the body..."

346
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,252
"You starve the soul."

347
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,338
How did you know that?

348
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,091
I did a little research--

349
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:18,926
enough to know
that when he died,

350
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,261
Bajor suffered a great loss.

351
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:28,561
I would've given...

352
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:32,732
my life to save his.

353
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,151
But all I could do
was just stand there

354
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,986
and watch his slip away.

355
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,290
Are you tired?

356
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,879
Not anymore.

357
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:58,007
Want to get
an early breakfast?

358
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,259
(<i> laughing</i> )

359
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,471
Sounds good.

360
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,274
My medical requisitions.

361
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,735
Why didn't you
just download them
into the computer?

362
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,695
Oh, um, I don't know.

363
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,906
Thought I might
stretch my legs.

364
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,449
See what was
happening in Ops.

365
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,243
Kira hasn't shown up yet.

366
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:26,410
Kira?

367
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,370
You are so transparent.

368
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,747
What are you talking about?

369
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,331
Your guilt is quite clear,
Doctor.

370
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,959
Guilt? About what?

371
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,334
About medical requisitions?

372
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,795
Don't be ridiculous.

373
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:39,465
Julian, Kira's personal life
is her own.

374
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:40,883
We're her friends.

375
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:43,510
We should respect
her privacy.

376
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,055
Good morning, Nerys.
How'd it go last night?

377
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,474
You mean dinner?
We had a great time. Why?

378
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,851
Uh, she means after
dinner but you don't
have to answer that

379
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,980
because<i> we</i> don't want
to invade your privacy.

380
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,857
But if you want to tell us
about it, we'll listen.

381
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,820
It went... well.

382
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,406
I told you.

383
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,742
I never doubted it.

384
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,954
Well, I, uh...

385
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,998
think I should be getting
back to the Infirmary.

386
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:15,209
Unless, um, there are
any more details forthcoming.

387
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:16,169
Good-bye, Doctor.

388
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,461
Good-bye.

389
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:23,134
Worf, any news from
General Martok's scout ships?

390
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:25,970
They report no Dominion activity
along the border.

391
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,429
Let's hope it stays that way.

392
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,811
Are you seeing him tonight?

393
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:35,188
At the Bajoran shrine.

394
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,982
That doesn't sound
very romantic.

395
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:40,234
He's going to have
his first Orb experience.

396
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:41,944
Your idea, I suppose?

397
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:43,946
No, actually,
it was his.

398
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,199
He's curious about
Bajoran spirituality.

399
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,201
It's a new
concept for him.

400
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:51,453
Well, it's not a midnight
swim in the holosuites,

401
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,914
but if it makes you happy.

402
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,964
So, where is this vedek?

403
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,049
He'll be here.

404
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,424
Now stop pacing.

405
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:07,469
This is an Orb experience,
not an execution.

406
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,972
I just don't want
to disappoint anyone.

407
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,308
That's sweet, but I'm
not going to judge you.

408
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:13,726
I know that.

409
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,895
I meant the Prophets.

410
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,521
What do I say to them?

411
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,690
You don't have
to say or do anything.

412
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,525
I just...

413
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,401
stare into the Orb.

414
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:26,072
Actually, it's more like
the Orb stares into you.

415
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:32,703
Welcome, my child.

416
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:36,832
Are you ready to proceed?

417
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,625
Yes.

418
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:44,882
Your<i> pagh</i> is strong.

419
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:47,843
You are ready to face
the will of the Prophets.

420
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,265
Come.

421
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,732
(<i> keypad beeping</i> )

422
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,559
Thank you. I'm...

423
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,685
not hungry.

424
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,855
Well, that's a change.

425
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:45,985
When you had your
first Orb experience

426
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,569
did you understand it?

427
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:51,407
I don't know that
anyone fully understands

428
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:53,491
an Orb experience--

429
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:54,952
not at first anyway.

430
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,998
You have to live
with it for a while.

431
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,707
Absorb it.

432
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:02,460
And then...?

433
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:08,466
And then one day, it...

434
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:11,385
becomes a part of you

435
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:13,095
a part of who you are.

436
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:19,477
I thought I would get
a glimpse of the future.

437
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:21,312
It was more than that.

438
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:26,108
It changes you.

439
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,818
There were so many images.

440
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:30,863
I couldn't keep
track of them all.

441
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,033
He was there.

442
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,951
Vedek Bareil.

443
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:40,538
We were together,
talking, but...

444
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:42,166
it was all mixed up.

445
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,667
I-I-I was him.

446
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,919
He was me.

447
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,882
It's all very confusing.

448
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:52,092
I don't think we should
be talking about this.

449
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,762
If I can't tell
you about it,

450
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,097
who can I tell?

451
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,432
No one.

452
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:01,810
An Orb experience
isn't meant to be shared.

453
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,608
I feel as if I could
sleep for days.

454
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:12,570
Well, that's a very
common reaction.

455
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,156
Why don't you get some rest?

456
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:16,534
I will.

457
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:17,868
Nerys...

458
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,959
It's all right.

459
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,172
I'll see you tomorrow.

460
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:50,109
(<i> sighs</i> )

461
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:00,536
I was wondering
when you'd get back.

462
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,538
What are you
doing here?

463
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,457
I know.

464
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:06,166
I'm early.

465
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:09,169
But my curiosity
got the better of me.

466
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:13,799
Besides, the thought
of you pining away for me

467
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,633
was too much to bear.

468
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:23,559
Now, tell me...

469
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,685
how's our little
plan progressing?

470
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,814
Couldn't be better.

471
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:31,108
Right on schedule.

472
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:33,902
That's just what
I was hoping to hear.

473
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,413
Now...

474
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:47,333
tell me everything
that's happened

475
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,042
since you got here.

476
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,210
Mmm, later.

477
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,795
I'm too tired.

478
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,214
Right now, all I want
to do is go to bed.

479
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,257
Mmm. Even better.

480
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:56,592
(<i> chuckles</i> )

481
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,011
I said I was tired.

482
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,805
You've never
been tired before.

483
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,890
It's been a long day.

484
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,396
I don't think
you're pleased

485
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,814
to see me.

486
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,777
Oh, it's her, isn't it?

487
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,112
(<i> scoffing</i> )

488
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,490
(<i> laughing</i> )

489
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,034
The Major's gotten to you.

490
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,578
Don't be stupid.

491
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,330
Oh, I'd be disappointed

492
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:29,249
if you didn't find
the Major intoxicating.

493
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:32,211
I mean, after all,
she<i> is</i> me...

494
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,380
or the next best
thing to me.

495
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,340
So...

496
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,133
what did you
think of her?

497
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,885
You are crazy.

498
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,888
Oh, we know what<i> I'm</i> like.

499
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,723
What about her?

500
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,475
I am not going to discuss this.

501
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,519
Oh, please.

502
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:49,936
Please.

503
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,730
I really want to know.

504
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,943
She's wonderful.

505
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:08,664
Mmm.

506
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:09,707
(<i> laughing</i> )

507
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,794
Oh, I knew it...

508
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:17,881
but she's too good for you.

509
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,050
We both are.

510
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:23,470
I mean, you're nothing
but a petty thief.

511
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,138
I know what I am.

512
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,682
That's it?

513
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,184
That's all you have to say?

514
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,728
I said I was tired.

515
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:32,062
Oh, Major Kira must...

516
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:35,274
This has nothing to do
with the Major. I...

517
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,819
I looked...

518
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,448
into the Orb today.

519
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:43,741
You did?

520
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:47,536
Oh, how very exciting.

521
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:52,874
So...

522
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,711
how soon can we
get our hands on it?

523
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:59,465
The vedeks are holding
a 26-hour vigil in the shrine.

524
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:01,883
Now, I cannot get near the place
until tomorrow night.

525
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,138
The Orb is
behind a force field keyed

526
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,264
to a decryption matrix.

527
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,683
Oh, which you can bypass.

528
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,435
That's what thieves do.

529
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:12,936
Oh...

530
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,606
today you're a thief

531
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:17,608
but tomorrow--

532
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:20,193
once we bring
our prize home--

533
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:24,657
you'll be the
Bearer of the Orb--

534
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:29,119
the holy man who unites
the Bajoran people

535
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,622
in a war against
the Alliance.

536
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:33,915
Just call me Vedek Bareil.

537
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:37,294
Think of it--
the wealth, the power.

538
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,379
You'll be like a god.

539
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:42,841
You're putting a lot of faith
in that Orb.

540
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,802
So will every
other Bajoran.

541
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:50,182
Oh, we're going
to have such fun.

542
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,350
I can hardly wait.

543
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,102
You<i> do</i> look tired.

544
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,813
You should
get some rest.

545
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,445
And tomorrow...

546
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,949
when you see the Major...

547
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:16,208
give her that...

548
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,626
for me.

549
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,254
Sleep well.

550
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,736
One more.

551
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:45,779
Coming right up.

552
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:50,075
What are you two
looking at?

553
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,164
Same goes
for the rest of you.

554
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,165
I am not

555
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,751
Vedek Bareil.

556
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,213
I just want to be left alone.

557
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:05,758
You heard the man.
Now, leave him be.

558
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:07,259
Sorry about that.

559
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,594
People can be so rude.

560
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:11,764
You know, I used to see
the vedek all the time

561
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:14,767
walking down the Promenade
with Major Kira.

562
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,685
Never came in here, though.

563
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:19,229
I guess dabo
wasn't his game.

564
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,816
It's an amazing resemblance.

565
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,484
Put you in a vedek's robe

566
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,736
and nobody would know
the difference.

567
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:28,947
Believe me, there's
a difference.

568
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,535
But not to the paying public.

569
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:37,372
You have a business
proposition for me?

570
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,374
Well, spit it out.

571
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,502
Picture this.

572
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,546
You seated here
wearing robes,

573
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:47,090
a long line of Bajorans
waiting patiently

574
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,593
to pay good money
just to meet Vedek Bareil--

575
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,428
maybe touch his hand.

576
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:55,599
Like I said,
I'm not Vedek Bareil.

577
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,893
A mere technicality.

578
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,060
You're the closest thing
to Vedek Bareil

579
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,312
they're ever going to see

580
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:01,897
which is why they're
going to love you.

581
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:04,023
I wouldn't know
what to say.

582
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,193
The less the better.

583
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:11,448
Just nod every once in a while
and smile... benignly.

584
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:12,991
It's very simple.

585
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,327
Later on, once you get
the hang of it,

586
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,704
you might even throw in
a blessing or two.

587
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,038
What do you think?

588
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:25,128
I've known people like
you my whole life--

589
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,839
nasty, greedy little minds

590
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:29,675
willing to do
whatever it takes

591
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:31,134
to make money.

592
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,638
I know just
how you think.

593
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:37,265
That's because<i> you</i>
think the same way.

594
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:45,357
(<i> mirthless laugh</i> )

595
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,776
I suppose I<i> am</i>
a lot more like you

596
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,445
than I'll ever be like...

597
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,322
Vedek Bareil.

598
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:53,365
Perfect.

599
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,325
Then we have a deal?

600
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,578
I'm afraid not.

601
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,705
Why?

602
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:01,707
Because right now

603
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,917
I don't like
either one of us.

604
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,423
(<i> sighs</i> )

605
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,176
It's a shame to see

606
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,846
such a perfect opportunity
go to waste.

607
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,506
Major, any idea
where they put

608
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,675
my shipment of
Saurian brandy?

609
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,093
Over there.

610
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,720
You heard her.

611
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,768
Your new boyfriend
came into my bar today.

612
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:04,102
Oh, did he?

613
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,855
He's... a little
different, isn't he?

614
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,147
From what?

615
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,984
From some of your
previous choices.

616
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:13,070
Don't get me wrong.

617
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:16,239
I had nothing against
Vedek Bareil or Shakaar,

618
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,117
but they were
a little too controlled--

619
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,869
a little too controlling.

620
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:23,496
They lacked
fire, excitement,

621
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:26,083
but this Bareil--
he's different.

622
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,459
He's full of surprises.

623
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,252
Oh, so I take it
that you<i> like</i> him.

624
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:32,589
Let's just say

625
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:35,050
I like the idea
of you<i> with</i> him.

626
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:40,555
But let me tell you
something, Major.

627
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,974
You'd better brace yourself.

628
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:43,642
You're in for a rough ride.

629
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,102
Oh, what are you
talking about?

630
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:48,229
I've been a bartender
for a long time.

631
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,983
I've seen all sorts
of customers--

632
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:53,526
sad ones, happy ones,
complicated ones.

633
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,862
Uh-huh, and Bareil--
where does he fit in?

634
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,824
He's one of the
tormented ones.

635
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:00,659
Tormented?

636
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,035
No, I don't think so.

637
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,454
Quark, you've had
an Orb experience.

638
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:06,123
You know what it's like.

639
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:10,669
Mmm... he had an Orb experience.

640
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:11,628
Interesting.

641
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:13,212
Oh, meaning what?

642
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,714
After he left the bar,

643
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,509
I saw him hanging around
the Bajoran shrine.

644
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,385
He must have been there
a couple of hours.

645
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,887
Well, he has
a lot on his mind.

646
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,681
He probably went there
to think things over.

647
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,934
Either that...

648
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,478
or he was figuring out a way
to rob the place.

649
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:32,732
What's this?
A union meeting?

650
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,068
Let's get going.

651
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,696
Nice chatting
with you, Major.

652
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,489
I hope you two...

653
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,158
are very happy together.

654
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:57,256
Well, what do you think?

655
00:36:57,256 --> 00:37:00,052
Even I'd have trouble
telling you apart.

656
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,763
Wearing the
Major's clothes--

657
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,598
it feels so intimate.

658
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,600
Oh, admit it.

659
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,853
You've never found
me more exciting.

660
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,771
It's like having the
best of both worlds.

661
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:15,942
Let's try to stay focused,
all right?

662
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,819
We both have jobs to do.

663
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:18,904
You're right.

664
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:20,155
We'll celebrate later.

665
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:21,740
Did you get the com badges?

666
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:25,284
Ooh, what
nimble fingers.

667
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:28,371
Contact me the minute
you have the Orb.

668
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:31,124
Right.

669
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:34,711
You're going to look
so good wearing a crown.

670
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:04,908
(<i> keypad beeping</i> )

671
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:14,960
Everything quiet?

672
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,919
Yes, Major.

673
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:17,670
Good.
I'm sorry.

674
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,006
I need your level-6
authorization code.

675
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,508
Oh, is that
really necessary?

676
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,427
It's the new protocol--
the war?

677
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:27,013
Of course.

678
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,389
(<i> gasps</i> )

679
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,766
Is everything all right?

680
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:31,184
I must've pulled
a muscle

681
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:32,978
exercising in
the holosuites.

682
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:36,397
It's been bothering
me all day.

683
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,818
Would you mind massaging
my shoulders for me?

684
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,904
I could make it an order.

685
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,490
(<i> chuckles</i> )

686
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,994
Mmm. A little
harder, please.

687
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:51,788
Ooh, such strong hands.

688
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:55,458
If only we had some
warm Somata oil.

689
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,252
That would be nice,
wouldn't it?

690
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,045
I guess.

691
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:05,426
You have a lot to learn
about giving a massage.

692
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,578
(<i> force field deactivates</i> )

693
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:39,836
KIRA:
What's that
old saying?

694
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,504
Once a thief?

695
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:44,132
What are you doing here?

696
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,592
The question is:
What are<i> you</i> doing here?

697
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,554
Nerys?

698
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:55,393
How did you know?

699
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,853
I didn't.

700
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:59,772
You had me completely fooled.

701
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,108
The thief
in search of redemption.

702
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,902
Who could
resist that?

703
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:06,738
Obviously, not me.

704
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:09,908
Luckily, Quark didn't
fall for your little act.

705
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,160
Now, step away from the altar.

706
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,454
I wish I could, but I can't.

707
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:19,000
I've come too far.

708
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,169
Then you came a long way
for nothing.

709
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:23,922
Nerys.

710
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:27,926
Oh, you look
as<i> beautiful</i> as ever.

711
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,934
You're just full
of surprises, aren't you?

712
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,269
Well, it's
only fair.

713
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:39,562
You had your Bareil;
I have mine.

714
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,982
You were supposed to wait for me
at the transporter pad.

715
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,650
Oh, don't worry.

716
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,195
I have the transporter
keyed to this control.

717
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:50,407
All I have to do
is tap this key

718
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:52,242
and we're on
our way home.

719
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:54,827
Besides,
I couldn't leave

720
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,330
without saying
hello to myself.

721
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,957
The transporter sensors

722
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,833
showed that you weren't
alone in the shrine

723
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,253
and I was hoping
it was you, Nerys.

724
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:04,503
Bareil's smart

725
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,214
but you're smarter.

726
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,758
We really are
alike, aren't we?

727
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,051
You can't let her
have the Orb.

728
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,177
It's too dangerous.

729
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,346
Will you stop
wasting your breath?

730
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:15,974
Antos and I are a team.

731
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,977
We're destined to do
great things together.

732
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:21,104
If we're going, let's go.

733
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:23,148
You don't have to do this.

734
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:25,024
Oh, isn't that sweet?

735
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,068
She is still trying
to save your soul.

736
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:29,654
Of course,
you don't have one.

737
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,072
She's right.

738
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:33,241
I'm not worth saving.

739
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,368
You sound pretty certain
of that.

740
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:37,203
Look at him.

741
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:40,123
Really... look at him.

742
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:42,125
It's important
that you see him

743
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,210
for what he truly is.

744
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,463
I do.

745
00:41:46,463 --> 00:41:48,381
So...

746
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:51,717
you were just using me
to get to the Orb.

747
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:54,095
Is that what I'm supposed
to believe?

748
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,888
Believe anything you want.

749
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:58,308
Please, Nerys, don't
embarrass yourself.

750
00:41:58,308 --> 00:41:59,517
You made a mistake.

751
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,686
You let Bareil
make a fool of you.

752
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,229
That's bad enough.

753
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,523
Don't make it worse
by denying what happened.

754
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,151
Just accept it and move on.

755
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:10,362
Why should I?

756
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:11,904
It's not true.

757
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:13,781
You know that as well as I do.

758
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,159
You may have come here
for the Orb,

759
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,370
but you found something else.

760
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,705
And people say that
<i>I</i> have a large ego.

761
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:21,789
Tell her, Antos.

762
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,083
Tell her how you
were using her.

763
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,918
That everything you
told her was a lie.

764
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,129
That every time
you touched her,

765
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:30,465
all you could think about
was me.

766
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:33,843
Oh...

767
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:41,518
When she wakes up, I'll have
a lot of explaining to do.

768
00:42:41,518 --> 00:42:43,728
And if you don't
have the Orb, she'll kill you.

769
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:45,604
Maybe.

770
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:49,275
That'll certainly be
her first reaction,

771
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:53,279
but I've talked my way back
into her good graces before.

772
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,864
I'll be all right.

773
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:59,077
I guess this is good-bye.

774
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,038
It's for the best.

775
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,338
You know what I saw

776
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,340
when I looked
into that Orb?

777
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,010
You and me...

778
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,387
together...

779
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:19,764
on Bajor.

780
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,974
We had a life...

781
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,935
a family.

782
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:25,395
What's wrong with that?

783
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:29,441
Nothing.

784
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:31,817
Might even work...

785
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,361
for a while.

786
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:37,073
But eventually,
I'd find some way
to ruin it.

787
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,994
I'm a thief.

788
00:43:45,582 --> 00:43:47,375
I belong with her.

789
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,463
Then you should go.
