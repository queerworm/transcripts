1
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:07,758
I've never seen
anything like that.

2
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:11,052
Hmm?
I've never seen
anything like that.

3
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:13,388
The woman?
She was dead.

4
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:14,556
The tricorder
clearly showed...

5
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,141
Ah, yes, well,
tricorders--

6
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,309
very accurate
with live people

7
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:18,769
not so accurate
with dead ones.

8
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:21,396
We learned that first
year medical school.

9
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,525
Well, I was
very impressed, Doctor.

10
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:27,611
Hmm, and well you
should have been.

11
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,113
I impressed<i> myself</i>
on that one, actually.

12
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,907
I can't imagine
what other doctor

13
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,826
would even consider examining
the scapular nodes

14
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:35,953
for parasitic infection.

15
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:38,413
I just seem to have a talent,
I suppose.

16
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,917
A vision that sees past
the obvious, around the mundane

17
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,084
right to the target.

18
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:46,171
Fate has granted me a gift,
Major.

19
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,590
A gift to be a healer.

20
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,512
I feel privileged to be
in your presence.

21
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:54,930
Oh, glad to have you along.

22
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,683
Did anyone ever tell you
that you're...?

23
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:00,811
COMPUTER:

25
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:06,274
Our central power linkage
has exploded.

26
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,943
We're losing life-support.

27
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,029
Please respond.

28
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:11,864
Just picking it up
on long-range sensors.

29
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:15,242
Bearing 347
mark 08.

30
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,703
I'm reading
massive energy leakage.

31
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:21,498
Its aft structural integrity
field is failing.

32
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,501
This is the Federation
Ship<i> Rio Grande.</i>

33
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,003
We're on our way.

34
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:34,553
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )

35
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:35,888
(<i> both coughing</i> )

36
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,932
O2 pressure is
dropping rapidly.

37
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:39,808
Toxic gas levels
are rising.

38
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,894
We've got no more
than ten minute's

39
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:43,311
breathing time
left in here.

40
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,898
Automatic fire suppression
must be off-line.

41
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:47,399
I'll check
the central power linkage.

42
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,026
(<i> both coughing</i> )

43
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,911
Relax.

44
00:01:58,911 --> 00:01:59,995
(<i> coughing</i> )

45
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:01,580
I'm a doctor.

46
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,458
What happened?
You lost consciousness.

47
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,294
Now listen, is there anyone else
aboard your ship?

48
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,088
We've got to evacuate it.

49
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:11,131
The pilot is dead.

50
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,466
(<i> coughs</i> )

51
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,969
I'm reading another life-form.

00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,971
(<i> coughing</i> )

53
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:19,681
No, don't open that.

54
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,182
It's sealed.

55
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,811
The prisoner
I was transporting...

56
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,980
he started the fire to escape.

57
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,898
He's dying.
Where is the manual override?

58
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,943
No!

59
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,319
Stop.

60
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,695
Don't!

61
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,158
Wait.
Don't go in there.

62
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,745
He's dangerous.

63
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:47,250
I assure you, in this condition,
he's of no threat to anyone.

64
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,004
KIRA:
Power linkages
are completely shot.

65
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:53,298
Maneuvering subsystems
are out.

66
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,343
I've managed to stabilize
the structural integrity field

67
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,886
but I don't know
how long it's going to last.

68
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,263
We'll have
to tow it in.

69
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,556
His synaptic field
is dissipating.

70
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,391
I can't get a neural reading.

71
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,310
I have to get him
to the emergency unit
on the runabout.

72
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,938
Computer, four
to transport.

73
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,523
(<i> gasping</i> )

74
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,571
Make...

75
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:20,575
me...

76
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,328
live.

77
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,412
(<i> grunts</i> )

78
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:25,914

(<i> long exhalation</i> )

80
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:39,469
This one, I
can't bring back.

81
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,312
(<i> sighs</i> )

82
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:54,855
Where am I?

83
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,607
You're on
Station DS9.

84
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,319
I'm Dr. Julian Bashir.

85
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,071
Ty Kajada.

86
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,282
Kobliad Security.

87
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,204
DS9...

88
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,164
but that's where he was going.

89
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:15,000
Where is he?
Where is Vantika?

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,293
Your prisoner?

91
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:19,004
He's dead.
You're certain?

92
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,714
Yes.
You were the only survivor.

93
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,923
Where is his body?

94
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,675
I have it
in stasis.

95
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,052
I want to see it.

96
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,261
When you're feeling stronger.

97
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,637
<i>Now.</i>

98
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:31,099
BASHIR:
Preliminary examinations
indicated

99
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,392
the subject died
of a massive respiratory failure

100
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,978
brought on by the
pulmonary trauma

101
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,064
suffered during
the fire.

102
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,358
Are you sure
it's the same body?

103
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,068
Quite certain.

104
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:44,029
It's been sealed in here
ever since our arrival.

105
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,993
Have you run
a retinal imaging scan?

106
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,619
What for?

107
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,997
To confirm that there is
no residual activity

108
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,290
in the visual cortex.

109
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:59,086
Miss Kajada, I assure
you, he is dead.

110
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:02,589
He's faked his death
more times than I can tell you.

111
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,759
And the last time
someone thought he was dead,

112
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,011
they didn't live
to regret the mistake.

113
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,888
He was a murderer?

114
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:13,975
That description
doesn't begin to do justice

115
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:18,105
to the horrors he's
responsible for on my world.

116
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:24,986
He's quite brilliant,
in his own way.

117
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,738
A man of science

118
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:30,700
who killed others
to prolong his own life.

119
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,371
I've tracked him for 20 years.

120
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,918
Please perform an autopsy.

121
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,964
I want his identity confirmed
with a DNA reference scan.

122
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,466
Uh... of course.

123
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,929
And have someone
scan my ship.

124
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,847
I want to make sure

125
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:56,184
there are no anomalous
life-forms on board.

126
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,730
Are you sure
that's necessary?

127
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,191
Very sure.

128
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,448
Iced<i> raktajino,</i> extra cream.

129
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:10,865
Thank you, Quark.

130
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,493
At your service,
day or night.

131
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,953
Thanks.

132
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,165
Poor woman.

133
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:21,335
She's obviously
infatuated with me.

134
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,461
(<i> scoffs</i> )

135
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:23,962
You're deluding yourself.

136
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:27,007
There's nothing wrong
with a good delusion.

137
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:30,302
I sell them upstairs to
dozens of people every day.

138
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:33,013
Besides, there
is something
in her eyes

139
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,515
when she looks at me.
Mmm.

140
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,018
An allergic reaction, no doubt.

141
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,479
I think she's lonely.

142
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,191
Dax? She has ten lifetimes'
worth of friends to call on

143
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,026
before she calls you.

144
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,568
And every man on the station

145
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:50,864
would like to be buying her
a<i> raktajino.</i>

146
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:54,242
Ah, but I'm the one with
the<i> raktajino</i> machine.

147
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,036
She seems to prefer

148
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,497
spending most of
her time alone,

149
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,040
which I understand
perfectly.

150
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,418
Then that must make her
the perfect woman for you.

151
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:08,048
I wouldn't intrude
on her privacy as some would.

152
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,549
You're pathetic.

153
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,426
You think
everyone in the galaxy

154
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:14,888
should be as lonely
and as miserable as<i> you</i> are.

155
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,515
As hard as it may be

156
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:20,852
for you to understand,
some of us like company.

157
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:24,272
The sound
of a friendly voice.

158
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,526
The sight
of a familiar face.

159
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:33,073
The feel of smooth,
pliant flesh.

160
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,033
Why do you bother?

161
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,285
It's good to want things.

162
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,871
Even things you can't have?

163
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,290
Especially things I can't have.

164
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,792
Like the deuridium shipment?

165
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,253
QUARK:
Deuridium shipment?

166
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,589
Is there a deuridium shipment
coming here?

167
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,301
I'm watching you, Quark.

168
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:57,472
And I'm watching you, Jadzia.

169
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:11,319
Interesting technique.

170
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,155
Do you always get ready
for an important operation

171
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,325
by leaking word about it
to the local black market?

172
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:22,789
How I handle my business
is none of your concern.

173
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,374
I'm afraid that it is.

174
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:27,544
Lieutenant George Primmin,
Starfleet Security.

175
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,796
And if you don't mind,
I would like to talk to you

176
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,382
about the deuridium shipment
from the Gamma Quadrant.

177
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,925
There's nothing
to discuss.

178
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:35,635
Security is
already in place.

179
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:39,639
I would appreciate it
if we could go over it anyhow.

180
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,224
It took me three weeks
to get here

181
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,435
and I'd hate to think
it was for nothing.

182
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,021
If you insist.

183
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:50,525
Meet me in my office
at 1700 hours.

184
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,946
The autopsy revealed
nothing out
of the ordinary.

185
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,864
Fingerprints, cerebral
cortex scans,

186
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,575
retinal patterns all
matched up perfectly

187
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,076
with the records
Kajada provided.

188
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,287
Vantika may have faked
his death before

189
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,747
but I don't think
he's faking this time.

190
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,082
Why was he coming here?

191
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,208
Well, they're Kobliad.

192
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,793
The deuridium.

193
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,003
I'm sorry...?

194
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,005
SISKO:
The Kobliad
are a dying race.

195
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,549
They need deuridium to stabilize
their cell structure.

196
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,551
It prolongs their life-span.

197
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,846
The Federation's been working
to supply them with deuridium,

198
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,098
but even the new deposits
from the Gamma Quadrant

199
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,351
aren't enough to service
the whole population.

200
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,186
It's so scarce

201
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,063
that some of the Kobliad
have gone underground to get it.

202
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,316
So, he was coming here
to hijack a shipment?

203
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,733
DAX:
Exactly.

204
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,777
Is Kajada satisfied
with your autopsy?

205
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,531
I don't think anything
is going to convince her

206
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,866
he's dead, Commander.

207
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,285
Vantika has been the focus
of Kajada's attention

208
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,662
for most of her adult life.

209
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:46,247
In a way, they were
as intimately connected

210
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,999
as any two beings
could be.

211
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,751
SISKO:
Let's do her the courtesy
of granting her requests

212
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,296
as long as they're not
too far out of line.

213
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:58,051
A quick sweep of her ship
is not too much to ask.

214
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,136
I'm more concerned
that Vantika might have
had help here

215
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,055
waiting to hijack
the shipment.

216
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,848
Ah, Mr. Primmin.
Good. In my office.

217
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,434
I want to brief you
on a security issue
that's arisen.

218
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,895
I'll get Odo
up here.

219
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,398
Uh, that's okay, Major.
I'll fill him in later

220
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,899
on anything
he needs to know.

221
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,370
How<i> are</i> you getting on with
the Constable, Lieutenant?

222
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,455
I'm sure he's very good
at keeping order

223
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,041
down there
on the Promenade.
But...?

224
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,712
Frankly, isn't the security
of a deuridium shipment

225
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:35,129
a little over his head?

226
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,091
I mean, he was chatting about it
in the bar

227
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,967
with that Ferengi, Quark.

228
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:43,346
If I could overhear it,
so could half a dozen others.

229
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,724
It's hard to keep a secret
in a place like this,
Lieutenant.

230
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:48,268
It's not a starship.
I understand that.

231
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,104
I'm sure almost everyone knows
about the shipment by now.

232
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,480
Odo was probably making sure

233
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,982
that Quark knows
we know he knows.

234
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:58,570
It's not the way they taught us
at the Academy, is it, sir?

235
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,197
If you want my opinion...
Actually, I don't.

236
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,743
You and I are guests
of the Bajorans, Lieutenant.

237
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:08,496
You don't have to forget what
you learned at the Academy;

238
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,624
you just don't throw it
in anyone's face here.

239
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,334
If you're really smart,
you might even learn

240
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,712
a few new things
about station security
from our Constable.

241
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:16,755
Clear?

242
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,382
Very clear, sir.

243
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,635
Now, regarding the shipment.

244
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:25,263
We've been made aware
of a possible Kobliad plot

245
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,181
to hijack the deuridium.

246
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:31,144
You and Odo ought to have
a talk with Kajada,

247
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,980
the Kobliad Security Officer
who arrived yesterday.

248
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,505
Um, before we get started,
I want to apologize

249
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:01,466
for us getting off
on the wrong foot.

250
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,176
Think nothing of it.

251
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,720
Listen, I know this
is your bailiwick.

252
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,306
I don't mean to be
throwing my weight around.

253
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,141
No hard feelings.

254
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,143
None at all.

255
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,688
Just because I'm from
Starfleet Security

256
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,190
doesn't mean I don't
respect your opinion.

257
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,108
How about showing
me what you got,

258
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,570
and I'll see if there's
anything we can work with?

259
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,238
(<i> sighs</i> )

260
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:27,200
Lieutenant, you're welcome
to see my plans,

261
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,495
but I assure you,
I've taken every precaution

262
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,288
regarding the shipment.

263
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,457
However, if you have
any suggestions,

264
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,334
I'd be happy to hear them.

265
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:37,418
(<i> beeping</i> )

266
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,754
What?!

267
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,090
Odo to Ops.

268
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,718
KIRA:
Go ahead.

269
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,512
Major, are we having
some sort of computer problem?

270
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:54,477
Everything in active memory
has been accessed and purged.

271
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:57,689
That's impossible.

272
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,482
KAJADA:
Oh, it's possible.

273
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:02,902
Vantika did the exact
same thing on Rigel VII.

274
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,623
I know Vantika.

275
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,292
I've learned
to think as
he thinks.

276
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,420
Kajada, our best
evidence suggests

277
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,005
Vantika stopped
thinking two days ago.

278
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,884
He's alive,
and he's on board
this station.

279
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:27,719
And his first thought
when he came on board

280
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:30,054
was to plan a way
to access your
security files

281
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,264
on the deuridium shipment

282
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,515
which is exactly
what he's done.

283
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,393
PRIMMIN:
Even if he
was alive,

284
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,270
it doesn't make sense

285
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,980
that he would purge
an entire computer memory

286
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,691
to go after a single file.

287
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,610
It makes
perfect sense.

288
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,528
Try to access
the single file,

289
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,113
and you'd be stopped

290
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,407
by a dozen
different lock-outs

291
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,576
that<i> I</i> put in
to protect it.

292
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,077
But you would never
consider locking out

293
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,829
the active memory
of your entire system.

294
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,373
It would make it impossible
to use the computers at all.

295
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,500
So that's where
you're vulnerable.

296
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,628
But how would he gain access?

297
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:02,879
KAJADA:
In the past

298
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,214
he's used a
subspace shunt.

299
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,801
It would be attached
to a secondary system
something that runs

300
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,218
throughout the
entire facility

301
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,637
but isn't covered
by security.

302
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,221
The lighting controls.

303
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,223
Or the replicators.

304
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:18,519
I'm showing an unauthorized tap
into the computer system.

305
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,229
A temperature
control panel,

306
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,774
level 21,
section 10.

307
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,317
Security to level...
Security...

308
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,570
To L-21, S-10.

309
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,947
We're looking

310
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:31,073
for a subspace
crossover link

311
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,700
to the computer system.

312
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,243
Acknowledged.

313
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,287
KAJADA:
Tell them to
be careful.

314
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:37,705
Vantika undoubtedly
equipped the shunt

315
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,707
with an auto-destruct system.

316
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:43,586
You know that for certain,
without having to check?

317
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,421
I know Vantika.

318
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,465
Miss Kajada, I must admit

319
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:50,635
I'm having a tough time
with your theory.

320
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,638
Then you're making
a fatal mistake.

321
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,265
Three passengers
were on your ship.

322
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,434
Two bodies are in our morgue.

323
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,645
Unless the ghost
of Vantika is...

324
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,522
Don't patronize me, Commander!

325
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:06,484
Isn't it more likely
that some accomplice did this?

326
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:10,530
Rao Vantika is obsessed
with his own survival.

327
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,950
He's prolonged his life
through the use of drugs,

328
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,494
cryogenics, transplants.

329
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:20,289
As a medical supervisor
in a high-security penitentiary,

330
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,625
he used prisoners

331
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,169
for his illegal experiments
in cellular longevity.

332
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,755
He's organized raids
on government labs

333
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,257
to steal bio-regenerative
research.

334
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:34,053
I promise you, when he started
that fire on board my ship,

335
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,972
he had a plan to survive.

336
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,098
I'm not sure
what that plan was,

337
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,393
but I'm convinced it succeeded.

338
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,937
Doctor, how soon
before we get the results

339
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,772
of the DNA trace?

340
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,483
I sent it
to Starfleet Command yesterday.

341
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,944
They'll have to coordinate
with Kobliad Security.

342
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,154
I'd say another 12 hours.

343
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:56,659
Until then, we will operate
under the assumption

344
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,745
that Vantika is alive.

345
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,835
Commander.

346
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,423
May I have
a word with you?

347
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,720
What's on your mind?

348
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,764
My resignation.

349
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,098
You're overreacting.

350
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,308
Oh, so you already
know about this.

351
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,227
Yes. Lieutenant Primmin
mentioned to me...

352
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,521
<i>You</i> asked me to stay
in charge of security

353
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,441
when you took command
of this station.
I did not ask you.

354
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,819
Constable, no one knows
this station like you do.

355
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,030
Oh, yes. I've
noticed that.

356
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,407
"Constable." It's very cute.

357
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,742
It's an expression of affection.

358
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,535
I believe Major Kira
was the first...

359
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,370
I don't need anyone's affection.

360
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,916
I do need clear
jurisdiction,
or I am out.

361
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,170
I like you, Odo.

362
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,716
I like to know
where a man stands.

363
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:57,344
There's never been
any question of that with you.

364
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,513
I need you here.

365
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:02,308
No Starfleet officer
can do the job you do.

366
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,726
You've got that straight.

367
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,728
But you have to realize
that Starfleet

368
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,064
is not going to take command
of a station in deep space

369
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,817
without assigning some security
to protect<i> its</i> interests.

370
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,860
Understandable.

371
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,821
You're going to have to work
with Primmin.

372
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,031
The two of you have to find
a way to get along.

373
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:19,033
Tell him that.

374
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,994
I already have.

375
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:22,703
Who's in charge?

376
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:26,833
In joint operations
like this one...

377
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,668
you are.

378
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,047
I can live with
that arrangement.

379
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,515
What have you got, Dax?

380
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,975
I'm not exactly
sure yet.

381
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:45,685
I finished the sweep
of Kajada's ship.

382
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,645
No anomalous readings, but
I did notice one odd thing.

383
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,480
What's that?

384
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,565
Someone tried to break into
the ship's cargo bay.

385
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,233
Since it's been docked?

386
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,111
Kira confirmed that
there was no damage

387
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,030
to the cargo area when
they brought it in.

388
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,115
What do you think
they were after?

389
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,117
This, maybe.

390
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:05,163
I found it in Vantika's
personal belongings.

391
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,246
What is it?

392
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,958
A map
of the humanoid brain.

393
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,943
You call this clean?

394
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,612
I've already found
three coins
on the floor up here.

395
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,198
Who knows what else
there might be.

396
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:42,449
Somebody may have lost
some valuable jewelry

397
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,659
or something.

398
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,037
Fine.

399
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,538
Never mind.

400
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,498
I'll do it myself.

401
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,085
And I'll keep it myself.

402
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,211
Leave!

403
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:00,509
You just can't find
good help anymore.

404
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,517
(<i> chuckling</i> )

405
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,439
(<i> grunting</i> )

406
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,566
(<i> hoarse whisper</i> ):
Have you made

407
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,359
the preparations?

408
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,569
Preparations?

409
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,029
What preparations?

410
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,364
The deuridium
shipment.

411
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:26,577
You were to hire
mercenaries to help me.

412
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,121
Help you...

413
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:31,165
but you can't be Vantika.

414
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:36,170
I told you
to expect me
at this hour.

415
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,671
Yes, and I contacted

416
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,258
some very reliable
soldiers of fortune

417
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:42,551
in anticipation
of your arrival.

418
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:46,139
But I was told
you were dead.

419
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,724
Almost...

420
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,644
but not quite.

421
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:14,458
You wanted to see me?
Kajada.

422
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,794
I'll be right with you.

423
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:18,671
There.

424
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,798
Now, remember, next time,
lift with your back straight

425
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:22,716
and use the anti-gravity
generator.

426
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,844
I'm sorry. Come in.

427
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,595
I have the DNA
scan results.

428
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,806
I thought you might
like to see them.

429
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,643
In fact, I tried
to call you last night.

430
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,728
But you never responded
to the com.

431
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:38,107
Um, I have a little
trouble sleeping.

432
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,109
Last night
was particularly bad,

433
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,736
so I used an alpha wave inducer
to help me.

434
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,488
Oh, you should
be careful with those.

435
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,199
They're only meant
for occasional use.

436
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,992
The scan results, Doctor.

437
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,535
Oh, yeah.

438
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:53,956
There wasn't even a trace
of diploid variation.

439
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:56,042
It's definitely not a clone.

440
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:59,503
Positive identification--
Rao Vantika.

441
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,255
They must have
overlooked something.

442
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:02,464
Dax to Bashir.

443
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,342
Yes, Jadzia?

444
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:05,718
I need some medical advice.

445
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,554
Can you come to my lab?
I'll be right there.

446
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,264
Bashir out.

447
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:13,351
Every conceivable test
has been done, Kajada.

448
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:16,812
DAX:
Here's the hypothesis.

449
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,523
The body dies,
the consciousness lives on.

450
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,567
In another brain?
Possible?

451
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:24,444
Well, the closest thing
I've encountered

452
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,613
is synaptic pattern
displacement,

453
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,657
but that's never been
done by a non-Vulcan.

454
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,784
I'm convinced Vantika
was working on it.

455
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,161
There are over 70 different

456
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,372
computer simulations
in his file.

457
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:36,456
All involve identifying
neural energy patterns

458
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,543
and storing them
in different areas of the brain.

459
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,628
Well, there's plenty of room.

460
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:44,882
A humanoid only uses a
small portion of the brain.

461
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:48,010
What if another entity
shared the unused portion?

462
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,845
Hypothetically...

463
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:53,849
Vantika's consciousness could be
occupying someone else's brain

464
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,852
while he waits for the
deuridium to arrive.

465
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,230
But whose?

466
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,648
Kajada.

467
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,401
They're both Kobliad.

468
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:05,152
What better place to hide

469
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,613
than in the mind
of your worst enemy?

470
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,656
It doesn't make sense.

471
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,658
She's been doing
everything she can

472
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,869
to convince us
that Vantika is alive.

473
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,913
If Vantika's controlling her

474
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:18,332
why would he call
attention to himself?

475
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:20,584
We're not suggesting
he's controlling her.

476
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,378
This is all
theoretical,

477
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,838
but to extend the
logic, there's no
reason to believe

478
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,715
she'd even be aware
of his presence.

479
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,676
Like a stowaway on a ship--
the pilot's at the helm

480
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:32,012
but someone else
is along for the ride.

481
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:35,473
Would an examination of
Kajada confirm any of this?

482
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,977
We don't know what
we're looking for yet.

483
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,729
We still have to identify
a method of transfer first.

484
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,231
I could assign some personnel

485
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:45,567
to maintain continuous
surveillance on Kajada.

486
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,653
We're already stretched
to the limit

487
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:48,904
preparing for
the shipment.

488
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,656
Why don't I just
set the computer

489
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,451
to track her movements
and alert us if she goes

490
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:54,618
near a secured area?

491
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:55,995
ODO:
At the very least

492
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:58,289
she has to be left out
of our security plans.

493
00:24:58,289 --> 00:24:59,665
She won't like that.

494
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:02,084
I'm afraid we
have no choice.

495
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,294
What do we tell her?

496
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:05,379
Nothing.
She'll figure it out.

497
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:08,257
When she does, send her to me.

498
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,431
The computer security
codes have been changed.

499
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:16,765
I've been denied access.

500
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:17,975
Why?

501
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,810
Because I ordered it.

502
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,728
What kind of fool are you?

503
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:24,606
My own special variety.

504
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,859
I'm the only one here
who has experience with Vantika.

505
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,777
I'm sorry.

506
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:32,156
I believe it's necessary
at this point to restrict access

507
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:34,783
to the security files
to four people:

508
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:38,871
myself, Lieutenant Primmin,
Major Kira and Commander Sisko.

509
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,459
When is the shipment
scheduled to arrive?

510
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,961
I can't give you
that information.

511
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,088
(<i> exasperated sigh</i> )

512
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:51,425
What about this
Ferengi-- Quark?

513
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:52,926
What about him?

514
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,512
From what I understand,

515
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:56,722
he has his hands
into everything around here.

516
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,516
Is he under surveillance?

517
00:25:58,516 --> 00:26:00,893
I always keep an eye on<i> him.</i>

518
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,520
I hope so,

519
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,562
because he's
exactly the kind

520
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,732
that Vantika would
use in his plans.

521
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,496
QUARK (<i> whispering):</i>
Everything has been
taken care of.

522
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,998
MAN:
That's what you said about
the job on Vener VII.

523
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,751
QUARK:
You should thank me
for Vener VII.

524
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,461
You got paid,
didn't you?

525
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,629
MAN 2:
We almost got killed.

526
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:32,508
QUARK:
A normal risk
in your line of work.

527
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:35,302
MAN 2:
A normal risk when
we work for you.

528
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,929
That's for certain.

529
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,890
ALIEN:
So, when do we
meet this Kobliad?

530
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,809
When he decides
it's appropriate.

531
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,771
All right, then,
a better question--

532
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,399
when do<i> we</i> get paid?

533
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:51,485
When the job is completed,
of course.

534
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,404
Not acceptable.

535
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,655
We'll require
an advance payment

536
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:56,865
of 70%.

537
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,159
Durg, wake up.

538
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,537
This is Quark
you're talking to, remember?

539
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:05,999
All past debts
have been settled.

540
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,834
They'll never be settled.

541
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:10,254
You'd still be rotting
in a Cardassian jail

542
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,547
if I hadn't...

543
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:12,965
(<i> Kajada screams</i> )

544
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,928
(<i> screams</i> )

545
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,651
Can you speak?

546
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:35,613
Pushed.

547
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:37,823
Vantika.

548
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,909
I can't keep her conscious
any longer, Commander.

549
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,660
If she moves too much,

550
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,955
she could suffer
permanent paralysis.

551
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,249
Did you see anybody
behind her?

552
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:50,877
I just heard the scream
and looked up.

553
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,670
She fell
from the balcony.

554
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,590
What was she doing
up there, anyway?

555
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,592
She had an odd feeling
you might be

556
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,178
helping someone hijack
this deuridium shipment.

557
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,220
I resent the inference.

558
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,472
It's not an inference.

559
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:03,599
It's a definite suspicion.

560
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,724
Was anyone else
in the bar?

561
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,143
QUARK:
Anyone else?

562
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:08,312
At the time of the accident.

563
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:10,272
No, just me.
Just tidying up

564
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:13,317
which, if you'll excuse me,
I really must finish.

565
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:14,818
Not so fast, Quark.

566
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:17,904
I want to take a look
at that third floor

567
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:20,032
before you get rid
of all the evidence.

568
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,617
Be my guest,

569
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:24,744
but I'm telling you,
she was alone up there.

570
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:27,623
And she had no business
invading the privacy

571
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:30,167
of a law-abiding member
of the community.

572
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:33,003
What do you think, Doctor?

573
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,588
Could this have been
a suicide attempt?

574
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,507
Well, I haven't
noticed any
indication

575
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:38,467
of suicidal behavior,
but then, who knows

576
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:41,761
what the effect of sharing
one's brain might be.

577
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,889
I'd still like
some confirmation of that.

578
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,016
I'll have to tend
to her injuries

579
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,018
before I conduct
any brain scan.

580
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,311
But until we find

581
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:51,480
the transfer method
Vantika used

582
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,940
I'm not even sure
what to look for.

583
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,360
Computer, location
of Lieutenant Dax.

584
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,279
Lieutenant Dax
is in the stasis room.

585
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:10,666
(<i> door opening</i> )

586
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:13,586
Find something
under his fingernails?

587
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:14,836
Not yet.

588
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,796
What are you
looking for?

589
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,633
Confirmation of a theory,
I hope.

590
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,594
I've been asking myself,

591
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:24,096
why would anyone induct
a bioelectrical charge

592
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,556
into a glial cell?

593
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:28,016
A question I have
always wondered about.

594
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,602
DAX:
Well, it might make sense

595
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:31,645
if you wanted to send
a bio-coded message

596
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:34,147
along the glial cells
of someone's nervous system

597
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,524
all the way to the brain.

598
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,067
My guess is

599
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:38,818
that's what Vantika
was trying to do.

600
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:40,404
Using his fingernails?

601
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:42,740
Frankly, I can't think
of another way

602
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,075
he could have delivered
the bio-coded message.

603
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:48,245
He must have used
a very weak electrical charge

604
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:51,665
or the sensors on Kajada's ship
would have detected it.

605
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,627
Ideally, he would have injected

606
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:57,796
the bio-coded message directly
into his victim's skin,

607
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,466
but there were
no hyposprays or needles

608
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:02,342
anywhere on the ship.

609
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,766
A microscopic generator.

610
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:11,435
You're suggesting he
stored his consciousness

611
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,228
in that thing?

612
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,440
His neural patterns encoded
as bioelectrical pulses.

613
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,110
He could have placed that device
under his nail months ago

614
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,904
just in case he needed an escape
route in an emergency--

615
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,782
his last resort before death.

616
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:26,992
Will this show up
in Kajada?

617
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,662
Now that we know
what we're looking for,

618
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:31,871
we should be able
to confirm it

619
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,373
with a glial scan.

620
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,042
Do it as soon as Bashir
stabilizes her.

621
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,336
Nice work.

622
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,221
Confirm that each
distribution amplifier

623
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,349
is at 100% efficiency.

624
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,225
If there's more
than a .03% fall-off,

625
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,603
replace it.

626
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,355
And that won't
mean a thing

627
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,148
if the power waveguide
outlets fail.

628
00:30:58,148 --> 00:30:59,941
Double-check them.

629
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,443
ODO:
You better make this
the last check.

630
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:02,611
We've only
got an hour.

631
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:03,779
Where's Primmin?

632
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,197
I thought he was with you.

633
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,366
I sent him to help you make

634
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,576
the final security sweep
of the docking area.

635
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,995
He has not been here
all morning.

636
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:18,627
I won't be going with you.

637
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:21,963
I'm simply a middleman,
a facilitator.

638
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,965
A profit monger.

639
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,759
And proud of it.

640
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,886
How did you get your hands

641
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,389
on a Federation
runabout, Quark?

642
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,683
I can't take credit for that.

643
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:35,435
Your employer
has somehow managed

644
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,688
to arrange security access.

645
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,861
When do we meet
this employer?

646
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:47,823
His message said he'd be
waiting for us on board.

647
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,452
Uh...

648
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,413
uh, I'm terribly sorry.

649
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:57,624
We seem to have made
a wrong turn.

650
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:01,336
We-we didn't mean
to disturb you, Doctor.

651
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:10,136
Not at all, gentlemen.

652
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:13,599
I've been expecting you.

653
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:23,525
Julian?

654
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:29,656
Computer, location
of Dr. Bashir.

655
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:32,701
Dr. Bashir
is in the Infirmary.

656
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:48,049
What the hell are
you doing in there?

657
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,969
I told you to sweep
the docking bay again.

658
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,930
I took a cue from you.

659
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,890
From me?

660
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,935
You understood the logic
of Vantika's MO

661
00:32:57,935 --> 00:33:00,771
when he downloaded
the computer memory--

662
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:03,690
avoid the single file,
attack the system.

663
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,109
I'm not following.

664
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,862
Vantika has to know
that all of our security efforts

665
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:10,697
will be focused
on the docking ring.

666
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:11,907
And...?

667
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,492
I figured,
if he holds true to form

668
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,452
that's not where
he'll try to hurt us.

669
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,621
So I ran a diagnostic
on all the systems

670
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,915
that could shut down
our whole defense array.

671
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,667
I've already done
that twice today.

672
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,961
I know. I didn't find
anything, either.

673
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:25,796
But then I went
to the backup systems

674
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:28,882
and I found a glitch there
I couldn't explain.

675
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:30,425
And I tracked<i> it</i> back

676
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,719
to the waste
reclamation system,

677
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,472
where nobody would ever
think to look

678
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:38,391
because it's considered
nonessential.

679
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,059
And I found this.

680
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,812
Another subspace
crossover shunt

681
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:43,480
just like the
one Vantika used

682
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,315
when he tapped
into the computer.

683
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:46,942
And it's set to feed back

684
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:50,195
into the primary command
and control functions.

685
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:54,950
This would have shut us
down for close to an hour.

686
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,577
Long enough for him
to grab that freighter

687
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,412
and warp it to who knows where.

688
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,547
Yes, Major?

689
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,382
The<i> Norkova's</i> just come
through the wormhole.

690
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:11,925
Requesting permission to dock.

691
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:13,802
Let's go to
a Security Alert Yellow.

692
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:16,013
What bay do you
have assigned in the plan?

693
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:17,347
Number Eight.

694
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:18,431
Odo...

695
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,099
maintain
a visible contingent

696
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,601
of security at Bay Eight.

697
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,144
But I'm sending
the<i> Norkova</i>

698
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,479
to the second
backup.

699
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,856
Bay 12.

700
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:28,149
I'll send additional
forces to 12.

701
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,402
Commander, your
Lieutenant Primmin there

702
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,487
just saved us all
a lot of problems.

703
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,990
Another subspace crossover
that would have crippled us

704
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,659
long enough for them to
escape with your deuridium.

705
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,119
Odo, did you deploy
a runabout

706
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:43,164
to escort the<i> Norkova?</i> 
No.

707
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:46,209
Then how come the<i> Rio Grande's</i>
going out to meet it?

708
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,086
On screen.

709
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:53,592
(<i> door opens</i> )

710
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,512
Benjamin, Julian's missing.
Missing?

711
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,472
His combadge
was in the infirmary.

712
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,099
I can't find him anywhere.

713
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,351
Computer, who authorized access

714
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,604
to the runabout<i> Rio Grande?</i>

715
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:08,440
Authorization:
access code 4-1-2-1.

716
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,525
Dr. Julian Bashir.

717
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:34,049
(<i> grunts</i> )

718
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,302
(<i> yells</i> )

719
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,181
(<i> yells</i> )

720
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,771
It's safe.

721
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,619
Shields up.

722
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:03,829
Done.

723
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,290
Secure the rest
of the ship.

724
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,458
Be sure to account

725
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:11,003
for all 12 members
of the crew.

726
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:13,212
If they resist,
kill them.

727
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,548
Enter the new course.

728
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,342
Aye.

729
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:25,642
The station has locked
a tractor beam on us.

730
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:27,978
But that's not possible.

731
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:30,939
They should be
shut down by now.

732
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:33,150
Well, they're not.

733
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,276
They're hailing us.

734
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,571
Hailing... us?

735
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:41,616
Engage engines,
full impulse.

736
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:45,286
We're not going anywhere
with a tractor beam on us.

737
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,039
Do it!

738
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:50,667
Full impulse engaged.

739
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,210
The tractor beam is holding.

740
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:56,048
But they won't be able
to pull us in.

741
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:59,425
We can't just sit here
and wait.

742
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:02,804
What do you intend to do?

743
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,017
Open a channel.

744
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:11,897
I'm Benjamin Sisko,

745
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:14,191
Commander of DS9.

746
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:18,028
Rao Vantika is my name.

747
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:27,913
But I assume you
know that already.

748
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:31,249
I want to talk to Dr. Bashir.

749
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:36,129
Unfortunately, he's not
available at the moment.

750
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:37,630
Is he all right?

751
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:42,260
His body is--
how do you humans say it?

752
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,846
Fit as a fiddle.

753
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:48,725
Looks rather good on me,
don't you think?

754
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:51,061
What have you done
to his mind, Vantika?

755
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:57,067
It was necessary to render him
unconscious for the time being.

756
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:59,569
However, I
might consider

757
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:04,032
leaving his body
and returning him to you.

758
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,868
But first, you must release

759
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:10,038
your tractor beam.
I can't do that.

760
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:14,918
If you don't,
I'll take this vessel to warp.

761
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:17,003
The tractor beam
would rip apart your ship,

762
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,214
and you and everybody on board
would be killed.

763
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:21,258
Exactly.

764
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:27,346
So if you care at all
about the welfare of your doctor

765
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:30,934
you will release
your hold on us.

766
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:34,187
You have one minute to decide.

767
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:38,691
Can we get
a transporter lock on him?

768
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,986
Negative. Their
shields are up.

769
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:42,361
Suggestions?

770
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,947
A small ship like a runabout

771
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:45,949
might be able
to get close enough

772
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:48,160
to overload
their shield generators

773
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,869
with directed phaser fire.

774
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:52,247
We used to do it to Cardassian
freighters all the time.

775
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,291
But you'd be risking
a hull breach

776
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:56,668
and with all the deuridium
on board...

777
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,628
He's right.

778
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:01,923
We can't risk releasing
deuridium into the system.

779
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:05,010
Every populated area
would have to be evacuated.

780
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,719
Dax, is there
any way to disrupt

781
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,847
Vantika's control
over Bashir?

782
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,223
I have an exact model

783
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:12,725
of Vantika's
neural energy patterns.

784
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,270
If I can design
an electromagnetic pulse

785
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,938
to disrupt those patterns,

786
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:18,315
Julian might emerge.

787
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:21,109
We still need a way
to get it there.

788
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:23,528
Could we run it
along the tractor beam

789
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:26,031
at the same frequency
as their shields?

790
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:28,449
The pulse would resonate
off the shields

791
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,452
and create a reflected EM
field inside the ship.

792
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,038
He's hailing us.

793
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:34,747
I need some time.

794
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:38,001
I'll give you as much as I can.
On screen.

795
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:40,086
Have you decided?

796
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,754
If I permit you
to leave,

797
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,465
what guarantee do I have
that you'll return Dr. Bashir?

798
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:48,970
Oh, you're far too ready
to capitulate, Commander.

799
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,014
Would you be planning

800
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:54,017
a rescue attempt, perhaps?

801
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:56,853
I'm only interested
in the safety of my doctor.

802
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:59,647
You insult my intelligence.

803
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,691
Prepare to go to warp.

804
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:04,527
You've gone to great lengths
to survive, Vantika.

805
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,239
I don't think you're ready
to kill yourself.

806
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:11,534
And I don't think
you are ready

807
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:17,123
to risk spreading deuridium
all over this system.

808
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:24,089
Ready to engage warp engines.

809
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:25,673
You must be crazy!

810
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,759
I want no part of this!

811
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:30,887
(<i> screams</i> )

812
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,892
No more middlemen, Sisko.

813
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,936
No more delays.

814
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,609
What's it to be?

815
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,444
All right.

816
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,863
We're prepared to release
the tractor beam.

817
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,489
Dax?

818
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:51,991
Ready.

819
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,701
Do it!

820
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:05,964
SISKO:
Dr. Bashir!

821
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,548
Answer me.

822
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,883
Bashir!

823
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,802
(<i> panting</i> )

824
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,637
Yes?

825
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:13,763
What?

826
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:16,849
Doctor, lower the shields!

827
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,851
What?

828
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,353
What... what shields?

829
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:21,646
Where am I?

830
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:22,939
I'll explain later.

831
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:25,233
Lower the shields now!

832
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:29,404
(<i> groaning</i> )

833
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,034
The shields are down.

834
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,119
Get him out of there!

835
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:37,203
Energizing.

836
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:47,380
It's okay.

837
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,881
It's...

838
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,508
me.

839
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:05,731
I've programmed
this transporter

840
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:09,986
to isolate any glial cells with
Vantika's neural patterns...

841
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:12,905
and to beam them from Julian

842
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:15,700
into this
micro-containment field.

843
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:25,001
Once they're out,
he should be back to normal.

844
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:05,666
I'm only reading
human neural patterns.

845
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,168
He's clear.

846
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:26,645
Oh, I have<i> the</i> worst headache.

847
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,731
(<i> groaning</i> )

848
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:43,746
Dr. Bashir, I'm so sorry
for all of this.

849
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,873
Well, I suppose we should
have listened to you

850
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,875
when you said he was alive.

851
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,794
There was no way
for you to control

852
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:50,962
what he was doing to you.

853
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:55,007
I'm afraid
I don't remember it.

854
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,010
Actually, I feel
quite humiliated.

855
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,012
No one blames you, Doctor.

856
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,599
It wasn't you.

857
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:04,392
It was that.

858
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:07,770
What do you intend
to do with it?

859
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,356
May I assume that
you've returned custody

860
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,733
of the prisoner to me,
Commander Sisko?

861
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,152
The prisoner?

862
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:15,694
What's left of him.

863
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,238
Good.
