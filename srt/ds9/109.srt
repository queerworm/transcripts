1
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:09,338
I've never seen
anything like that.

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,508
Hmm?

3
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:12,349
I've never seen
anything like that.

4
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:13,446
The woman?

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,618
She was dead.

6
00:00:14,658 --> 00:00:16,127
The tricorder clearly showed...

7
00:00:16,163 --> 00:00:17,462
Ah, yes, well, tricorders...

8
00:00:17,499 --> 00:00:18,968
very accurate with live people

9
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:20,495
not so accurate with dead ones.

10
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,602
We learned that first
year medical school.

11
00:00:22,645 --> 00:00:26,849
Well, I was
very impressed, Doctor.

12
00:00:26,889 --> 00:00:28,860
Hmm, and well you
should have been.

13
00:00:28,893 --> 00:00:31,491
I impressed myself
on that one, actually.

14
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:33,333
I can't imagine
what other doctor

15
00:00:33,371 --> 00:00:36,037
would even consider examining
the scapular nodes

16
00:00:36,076 --> 00:00:37,375
for parasitic infection.

17
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:39,884
I just seem to have a talent,
I suppose.

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,190
A vision that sees past
the obvious, around the mundane

19
00:00:43,227 --> 00:00:45,425
right to the target.

20
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:47,870
Fate has granted me a gift,
Major.

21
00:00:47,905 --> 00:00:49,899
A gift to be a healer.

22
00:00:51,814 --> 00:00:54,787
I feel privileged to be
in your presence.

23
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:56,155
Oh, glad to have you along.

24
00:00:56,192 --> 00:00:58,288
Did anyone ever tell you
that you're?

25
00:00:58,397 --> 00:01:02,031
Priority one
broadband distress signal.

26
00:01:02,073 --> 00:01:05,980
Kobliad Transport Ship <i>Reyab</i>
to any ship.

27
00:01:06,015 --> 00:01:08,043
Our central power linkage
has exploded.

28
00:01:08,087 --> 00:01:09,887
We're losing life-support.

29
00:01:09,925 --> 00:01:11,224
Please respond.

30
00:01:11,262 --> 00:01:14,235
Just picking it up
on long-range sensors.

31
00:01:14,269 --> 00:01:16,570
Bearing 347 mark 08.

32
00:01:16,607 --> 00:01:18,908
I'm reading
massive energy leakage.

33
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:22,751
Its aft structural integrity
field is failing.

34
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:25,762
This is the Federation
Ship <i>Rio Grande.</i>

35
00:01:25,796 --> 00:01:27,322
We're on our way.

36
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,320
O2 pressure is dropping rapidly.

37
00:01:39,362 --> 00:01:41,162
Toxic gas levels are rising.

38
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:43,193
We've got no more
than ten minutes'

39
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:44,831
breathing time left in here.

40
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:47,848
Automatic fire suppression
must be off-line.

41
00:01:47,882 --> 00:01:49,876
I'll check
the central power linkage.

42
00:01:58,073 --> 00:02:00,169
Relax.

43
00:02:01,415 --> 00:02:02,850
I'm a doctor.

44
00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:04,252
What happened?

45
00:02:04,288 --> 00:02:05,757
You lost consciousness.

46
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,629
Now listen, is there anyone else
aboard your ship?

47
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,226
We've got to evacuate it.

48
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:12,433
The pilot is dead.

49
00:02:13,811 --> 00:02:16,146
I'm reading another life-form.

50
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,917
No, don't open that.

51
00:02:20,961 --> 00:02:22,590
It's sealed.

52
00:02:22,632 --> 00:02:25,035
The prisoner
I was transporting...

53
00:02:25,072 --> 00:02:27,202
he started the fire to escape.

54
00:02:27,243 --> 00:02:28,542
He's dying.

55
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,551
Where is the manual override?

56
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:32,385
No!

57
00:02:32,456 --> 00:02:33,652
Stop.

58
00:02:33,692 --> 00:02:34,922
Don't!

59
00:02:37,601 --> 00:02:39,127
Wait.

60
00:02:39,172 --> 00:02:41,770
Don't go in there.

61
00:02:41,811 --> 00:02:43,975
He's dangerous.

62
00:02:45,487 --> 00:02:48,757
I assure you, in this condition,
he's of no threat to anyone.

63
00:02:48,795 --> 00:02:51,427
Power linkages
are completely shot.

64
00:02:51,468 --> 00:02:54,874
Maneuvering subsystems
are out.

65
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,815
I've managed to stabilize
the structural integrity field

66
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,151
but I don't know
how long it's going to last.

67
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:01,624
We'll have to tow it in.

68
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:02,855
His synaptic field
is dissipating.

69
00:03:02,896 --> 00:03:03,990
I can't get a neural reading.

70
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:06,502
I have to get him
to the emergency unit

71
00:03:06,538 --> 00:03:07,506
on the runabout.

72
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,305
Computer, four to transport.

73
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,863
Make...

74
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:21,863
me...

75
00:03:21,907 --> 00:03:24,641
live.

76
00:03:38,447 --> 00:03:40,782
This one, I can't bring back.

77
00:05:55,062 --> 00:05:56,497
Where am I?

78
00:05:56,532 --> 00:05:57,626
You're on Station DS9.

79
00:05:57,668 --> 00:06:01,302
I'm Dr. Julian Bashir.

80
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:03,838
Ty Kajada.

81
00:06:03,883 --> 00:06:06,218
Kobliad Security.

82
00:06:08,728 --> 00:06:11,199
DS9...

83
00:06:11,234 --> 00:06:13,171
but that's where he was going.

84
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,334
Where is he?

85
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,004
Where is Vantika?

86
00:06:16,046 --> 00:06:17,345
Your prisoner?

87
00:06:17,383 --> 00:06:18,682
He's dead.

88
00:06:18,718 --> 00:06:19,846
You're certain?

89
00:06:19,888 --> 00:06:21,722
Yes.
You were the only survivor.

90
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,059
Where is his body?

91
00:06:23,096 --> 00:06:24,565
I have it in stasis.

92
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,933
I want to see it.

93
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,269
When you're feeling stronger.

94
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:28,638
Now.

95
00:06:28,675 --> 00:06:30,578
Preliminary examinations
indicated

96
00:06:30,614 --> 00:06:33,918
the subject died
of a massive respiratory failure

97
00:06:33,955 --> 00:06:36,222
brought on
by the pulmonary trauma

98
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:37,890
suffered during the fire.

99
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:40,563
Are you sure
it's the same body?

100
00:06:40,604 --> 00:06:41,903
Quite certain.

101
00:06:41,941 --> 00:06:44,410
It's been sealed in here
ever since our arrival.

102
00:06:47,952 --> 00:06:50,584
Have you run
a retinal imaging scan?

103
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,094
What for?

104
00:06:52,128 --> 00:06:54,497
To confirm that there is
no residual activity

105
00:06:54,602 --> 00:06:55,901
in the visual cortex.

106
00:06:55,937 --> 00:06:59,503
Miss Kajada, I assure
you, he is dead.

107
00:06:59,547 --> 00:07:03,010
He's faked his death
more times than I can tell you.

108
00:07:03,054 --> 00:07:06,186
And the last time
someone thought he was dead

109
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:09,031
they didn't live
to regret the mistake.

110
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:10,470
He was a murderer?

111
00:07:10,573 --> 00:07:14,378
That description
doesn't begin to do justice

112
00:07:14,415 --> 00:07:18,414
to the horrors he's
responsible for on my world.

113
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:25,338
He's quite brilliant,
in his own way.

114
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:28,838
A man of science,
who killed others

115
00:07:28,884 --> 00:07:31,185
to prolong his own life.

116
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:34,856
I've tracked him for 20 years.

117
00:07:38,506 --> 00:07:40,409
Please perform an autopsy.

118
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:44,547
I want his identity confirmed
with a DNA reference scan.

119
00:07:44,621 --> 00:07:46,956
Uh... of course.

120
00:07:48,564 --> 00:07:51,366
And have someone scan my ship.

121
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,375
I want to make sure

122
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:56,747
there are no anomalous
life-forms on board.

123
00:07:58,688 --> 00:08:01,159
Are you sure that's necessary?

124
00:08:01,194 --> 00:08:03,688
Very sure.

125
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,147
Iced <i>raktajino,</i> extra cream.

126
00:08:10,182 --> 00:08:11,481
Thank you, Quark.

127
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,151
At your service, day or night.

128
00:08:14,192 --> 00:08:15,525
Thanks.

129
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,028
Poor woman.

130
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,066
She's obviously
infatuated with me.

131
00:08:23,214 --> 00:08:24,877
You're deluding yourself.

132
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:27,891
There's nothing wrong
with a good delusion.

133
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:31,195
I sell them upstairs to
dozens of people every day.

134
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:33,865
Besides, there
is something in her eyes

135
00:08:33,905 --> 00:08:35,135
when she looks at me.

136
00:08:35,175 --> 00:08:36,200
Mmm.

137
00:08:36,245 --> 00:08:38,877
An allergic reaction, no doubt.

138
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:41,320
I think she's lonely.

139
00:08:41,357 --> 00:08:44,991
Dax? She has ten lifetimes'
worth of friends to call on

140
00:08:45,032 --> 00:08:46,626
before she calls you.

141
00:08:46,703 --> 00:08:48,901
And every man on the station

142
00:08:48,941 --> 00:08:51,573
would like to be buying her
a <i>raktajino.</i>

143
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:55,021
Ah, but I'm the one
with the <i>raktajino</i> machine.

144
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:59,260
She seems to prefer
spending most of her time alone

145
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,963
which I understand perfectly.

146
00:09:01,004 --> 00:09:04,240
Then that must make her
the perfect woman for you.

147
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:08,619
I wouldn't intrude
on her privacy as some would.

148
00:09:08,689 --> 00:09:09,988
You're pathetic.

149
00:09:10,026 --> 00:09:12,224
You think everyone in the galaxy

150
00:09:12,264 --> 00:09:15,636
should be as lonely
and as miserable as you are.

151
00:09:15,739 --> 00:09:17,231
As hard as it may be

152
00:09:17,276 --> 00:09:21,776
for you to understand,
some of us like company.

153
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,124
The sound
of a friendly voice.

154
00:09:25,162 --> 00:09:28,329
The sight
of a familiar face.

155
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:33,679
The feel of smooth,
pliant flesh.

156
00:09:33,749 --> 00:09:35,913
Why do you bother?

157
00:09:35,954 --> 00:09:38,118
It's good to want things.

158
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:40,688
Even things you can't have?

159
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,100
Especially things I can't have.

160
00:09:43,138 --> 00:09:45,507
Like the deuridium shipment?

161
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:47,138
Deuridium shipment?

162
00:09:47,181 --> 00:09:50,348
Is there a deuridium shipment
coming here?

163
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:54,160
I'm watching you, Quark.

164
00:09:54,198 --> 00:09:58,231
And I'm watching you, Jadzia.

165
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,170
Interesting technique.

166
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:15,045
Do you always get ready
for an important operation

167
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:18,180
by leaking word about it
to the local black market?

168
00:10:18,222 --> 00:10:23,565
How I handle my business
is none of your concern.

169
00:10:23,602 --> 00:10:25,231
I'm afraid that it is.

170
00:10:25,272 --> 00:10:28,404
Lieutenant George Primmin,
Starfleet Security.

171
00:10:28,447 --> 00:10:30,577
And if you don't mind,
I would like to talk to you

172
00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:33,615
about the deuridium shipment
from the Gamma Quadrant.

173
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:34,958
There's nothing to discuss.

174
00:10:34,996 --> 00:10:36,465
Security is already in place.

175
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,465
I would appreciate it
if we could go over it anyhow.

176
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:42,172
It took me three weeks
to get here

177
00:10:42,213 --> 00:10:44,275
and I'd hate to think
it was for nothing.

178
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:47,985
If you insist.

179
00:10:48,027 --> 00:10:51,365
Meet me in my office
at 1700 hours.

180
00:10:53,373 --> 00:10:56,005
The autopsy revealed
nothing out of the ordinary.

181
00:10:56,046 --> 00:10:57,675
Fingerprints,
cerebral cortex scans

182
00:10:57,717 --> 00:10:59,448
retinal patterns
all matched up perfectly

183
00:10:59,488 --> 00:11:01,117
with the records
Kajada provided.

184
00:11:01,158 --> 00:11:03,288
Vantika may have faked
his death before

185
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,494
but I don't think
he's faking this time.

186
00:11:05,535 --> 00:11:06,834
Why was he coming here?

187
00:11:06,872 --> 00:11:08,068
Well, they're Kobliad.

188
00:11:08,108 --> 00:11:09,577
The deuridium.

189
00:11:09,612 --> 00:11:10,979
I'm sorry?

190
00:11:11,015 --> 00:11:12,986
The Kobliad are a dying race.

191
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,959
They need deuridium to stabilize
their cell structure.

192
00:11:15,994 --> 00:11:17,486
It prolongs their life-span.

193
00:11:17,531 --> 00:11:20,663
The Federation's been working
to supply them with deuridium

194
00:11:20,706 --> 00:11:22,870
but even the new deposits
from the Gamma Quadrant

195
00:11:22,944 --> 00:11:25,245
aren't enough to service
the whole population.

196
00:11:25,283 --> 00:11:27,117
It's so scarce

197
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,888
that some of the Kobliad
have gone underground to get it.

198
00:11:29,928 --> 00:11:32,229
So, he was coming here
to hijack a shipment?

199
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:33,566
Exactly.

200
00:11:33,603 --> 00:11:35,631
Is Kajada satisfied
with your autopsy?

201
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:39,241
I don't think anything
is going to convince her

202
00:11:39,284 --> 00:11:40,913
he's dead, Commander.

203
00:11:40,954 --> 00:11:43,187
Vantika has been the focus
of Kajada's attention

204
00:11:43,226 --> 00:11:44,525
for most of her adult life.

205
00:11:44,562 --> 00:11:47,194
In a way, they were
as intimately connected

206
00:11:47,236 --> 00:11:48,865
as any two beings could be.

207
00:11:48,906 --> 00:11:52,871
Let's do her the courtesy
of granting her requests

208
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,853
as long as they're not
too far out of line.

209
00:11:54,887 --> 00:11:57,358
A quick sweep of her ship
is not too much to ask.

210
00:11:57,393 --> 00:11:58,692
I'm more concerned

211
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,133
that Vantika might have
had help here

212
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:03,140
waiting to hijack the shipment.

213
00:12:03,174 --> 00:12:05,145
Ah, Mr. Primmin.
Good. In my office.

214
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:06,409
I want to brief you

215
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:08,477
on a security issue
that's arisen.

216
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,921
I'll get Odo up here.

217
00:12:10,024 --> 00:12:11,323
Uh, that's okay, Major.

218
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,661
I'll fill him in later
on anything he needs to know.

219
00:12:23,623 --> 00:12:26,357
How are you getting on with
the Constable, Lieutenant?

220
00:12:26,396 --> 00:12:28,424
I'm sure he's very good
at keeping order

221
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:29,731
down there on the Promenade.

222
00:12:29,771 --> 00:12:31,104
But?

223
00:12:31,141 --> 00:12:34,547
Frankly, isn't the security
of a deuridium shipment

224
00:12:34,582 --> 00:12:36,142
a little over his head?

225
00:12:36,186 --> 00:12:39,091
I mean, he was chatting about it
in the bar

226
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:40,823
with that Ferengi, Quark.

227
00:12:40,864 --> 00:12:43,335
If I could overhear it,
so could half a dozen others.

228
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,805
It's hard to keep a secret

229
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,674
in a place like this,
Lieutenant.

230
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:48,010
It's not a starship.

231
00:12:48,048 --> 00:12:49,347
I understand that.

232
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:52,655
I'm sure almost everyone knows
about the shipment by now.

233
00:12:52,692 --> 00:12:54,127
Odo was probably making sure

234
00:12:54,162 --> 00:12:55,893
that Quark knows
we know he knows.

235
00:12:55,934 --> 00:12:59,602
It's not the way they taught us
at the Academy, is it, sir?

236
00:12:59,642 --> 00:13:01,043
If you want my opinion...

237
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:02,378
Actually, I don't.

238
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,686
You and I are guests
of the Bajorans, Lieutenant.

239
00:13:05,723 --> 00:13:09,528
You don't have to forget what
you learned at the Academy

240
00:13:09,566 --> 00:13:12,539
you just don't throw it
in anyone's face here.

241
00:13:12,573 --> 00:13:14,407
If you're really smart,
you might even learn

242
00:13:14,445 --> 00:13:16,541
a few new things about station
security from our Constable.

243
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:17,573
Clear?

244
00:13:19,156 --> 00:13:20,284
Very clear, sir.

245
00:13:20,325 --> 00:13:22,626
Now, regarding the shipment.

246
00:13:22,664 --> 00:13:26,196
We've been made aware
of a possible Kobliad plot

247
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,039
to hijack the deuridium.

248
00:13:28,077 --> 00:13:32,213
You and Odo ought to have
a talk with Kajada

249
00:13:32,254 --> 00:13:35,091
the Kobliad Security Officer
who arrived yesterday.

250
00:13:55,337 --> 00:13:58,778
Um, before we get started,
I want to apologize

251
00:13:58,812 --> 00:14:01,580
for us getting off
on the wrong foot.

252
00:14:01,619 --> 00:14:03,248
Think nothing of it.

253
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:05,921
Listen, I know
this is your bailiwick.

254
00:14:05,963 --> 00:14:09,267
I don't mean to be
throwing my weight around.

255
00:14:09,303 --> 00:14:10,772
No hard feelings.

256
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:12,276
None at all.

257
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:14,943
Just because I'm
from Starfleet Security

258
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:17,786
doesn't mean I don't
respect your opinion.

259
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:20,125
How about showing me
what you got

260
00:14:20,163 --> 00:14:22,692
and I'll see if there's
anything we can work with?

261
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:27,471
Lieutenant, you're welcome
to see my plans

262
00:14:27,514 --> 00:14:30,646
but I assure you,
I've taken every precaution

263
00:14:30,688 --> 00:14:32,317
regarding the shipment.

264
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:34,660
However, if you have
any suggestions

265
00:14:34,698 --> 00:14:36,601
I'd be happy to hear them.

266
00:14:37,671 --> 00:14:40,165
What?!

267
00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:43,251
Odo to Ops.

268
00:14:43,285 --> 00:14:44,584
Go ahead.

269
00:14:44,622 --> 00:14:48,461
Major, are we having
some sort of computer problem?

270
00:14:50,602 --> 00:14:54,942
Everything in active memory
has been accessed and purged.

271
00:14:56,516 --> 00:14:57,985
That's impossible.

272
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,717
Oh, it's possible.

273
00:14:59,758 --> 00:15:02,959
Vantika did the exact
same thing on Rigel VII.

274
00:15:14,861 --> 00:15:16,353
I know Vantika.

275
00:15:16,397 --> 00:15:18,891
I've learned to think
as he thinks.

276
00:15:18,937 --> 00:15:21,204
Kajada, our best
evidence suggests

277
00:15:21,243 --> 00:15:23,807
Vantika stopped
thinking two days ago.

278
00:15:23,849 --> 00:15:25,011
He's alive

279
00:15:25,051 --> 00:15:26,577
and he's on board this station.

280
00:15:26,622 --> 00:15:28,525
And his first thought
when he came on board

281
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,656
was to plan a way
to access your security files

282
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:33,364
on the deuridium shipment,
which is exactly what he's done.

283
00:15:33,405 --> 00:15:37,438
Even if he was alive,
it doesn't make sense

284
00:15:37,482 --> 00:15:40,580
that he would purge
an entire computer memory

285
00:15:40,622 --> 00:15:42,456
to go after a single file.

286
00:15:42,494 --> 00:15:44,123
It makes perfect sense.

287
00:15:44,164 --> 00:15:46,260
Try to access the single file

288
00:15:46,303 --> 00:15:47,795
and you'd be stopped

289
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,037
by a dozen
different lock-outs

290
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:52,106
that I put in to protect it.

291
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,779
But you would never
consider locking out

292
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,483
the active memory
of your entire system.

293
00:15:55,558 --> 00:15:58,292
It would make it impossible
to use the computers at all.

294
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,063
So that's where
you're vulnerable.

295
00:16:00,102 --> 00:16:02,232
But how would he gain access?

296
00:16:02,274 --> 00:16:05,578
In the past, he's used
a subspace shunt.

297
00:16:05,616 --> 00:16:07,450
It would be attached
to a secondary system

298
00:16:07,487 --> 00:16:09,822
something that runs
throughout the entire facility

299
00:16:09,859 --> 00:16:11,294
but isn't covered by security.

300
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:13,300
The lighting controls.

301
00:16:13,334 --> 00:16:14,860
Or the replicators.

302
00:16:14,904 --> 00:16:19,040
I'm showing an unauthorized tap
into the computer system.

303
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:23,421
A temperature control panel,
level 21, section 10.

304
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,859
- Security to level...
- Security...

305
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,328
To L-21, S-10.

306
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:31,708
We're looking
for a subspace crossover link

307
00:16:31,745 --> 00:16:33,408
to the computer system.

308
00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:34,508
Acknowledged.

309
00:16:34,551 --> 00:16:36,954
Tell them to be careful.

310
00:16:36,991 --> 00:16:38,426
Vantika undoubtedly
equipped the shunt

311
00:16:38,461 --> 00:16:40,432
with an auto-destruct system.

312
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:44,100
You know that for certain,
without having to check?

313
00:16:44,141 --> 00:16:45,975
I know Vantika.

314
00:16:46,012 --> 00:16:48,074
Miss Kajada, I must admit

315
00:16:48,117 --> 00:16:51,489
I'm having a tough time
with your theory.

316
00:16:51,525 --> 00:16:54,396
Then you're making
a fatal mistake.

317
00:16:54,432 --> 00:16:56,869
Three passengers
were on your ship.

318
00:16:56,905 --> 00:16:59,035
Two bodies are in our morgue.

319
00:16:59,077 --> 00:17:01,446
Unless the ghost
of Vantika is...

320
00:17:01,483 --> 00:17:03,283
Don't patronize me, Commander!

321
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:07,092
Isn't it more likely
that some accomplice did this?

322
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:11,368
Rao Vantika is obsessed
with his own survival.

323
00:17:11,407 --> 00:17:15,109
He's prolonged his life
through the use of drugs

324
00:17:15,149 --> 00:17:17,052
cryogenics, transplants.

325
00:17:17,087 --> 00:17:20,892
As a medical supervisor
in a high-security penitentiary

326
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:22,228
he used prisoners

327
00:17:22,266 --> 00:17:25,832
for his illegal experiments
in cellular longevity.

328
00:17:25,874 --> 00:17:28,540
He's organized raids
on government labs

329
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:30,950
to steal bio-regenerative
research.

330
00:17:30,986 --> 00:17:34,951
I promise you, when he started
that fire on board my ship

331
00:17:34,996 --> 00:17:36,761
he had a plan to survive.

332
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,175
I'm not sure what that plan was,
but I'm convinced it succeeded.

333
00:17:41,212 --> 00:17:45,587
Doctor, how soon before we get
the results of the DNA trace?

334
00:17:45,622 --> 00:17:48,186
I sent it
to Starfleet Command yesterday.

335
00:17:48,228 --> 00:17:51,326
They'll have to coordinate
with Kobliad Security.

336
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:52,998
I'd say another 12 hours.

337
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,243
Until then, we will operate
under the assumption

338
00:17:57,283 --> 00:17:59,277
that Vantika is alive.

339
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:06,293
Commander.

340
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,974
May I have a word with you?

341
00:18:14,825 --> 00:18:16,454
What's on your mind?

342
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,524
My resignation.

343
00:18:18,568 --> 00:18:19,764
You're overreacting.

344
00:18:19,804 --> 00:18:21,934
Oh, so you already
know about this.

345
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,947
Yes. Lieutenant Primmin
mentioned to me...

346
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,247
You asked me to stay
in charge of security

347
00:18:26,286 --> 00:18:27,880
when you took command
of this station.

348
00:18:27,923 --> 00:18:29,051
I did not ask you.

349
00:18:29,093 --> 00:18:32,659
Constable, no one knows
this station like you do.

350
00:18:32,702 --> 00:18:34,673
Oh, yes.
I've noticed that.

351
00:18:34,772 --> 00:18:37,039
"Constable."
It's very cute.

352
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:38,514
It's an expression of affection.

353
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:40,178
I believe Major Kira
was the first...

354
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,156
I don't need anyone's affection.

355
00:18:42,191 --> 00:18:43,854
I do need clear jurisdiction

356
00:18:43,894 --> 00:18:45,420
or I am out.

357
00:18:48,406 --> 00:18:50,877
I like you, Odo.

358
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:54,545
I like to know
where a man stands.

359
00:18:54,587 --> 00:18:57,993
There's never been
any question of that with you.

360
00:18:58,029 --> 00:19:00,159
I need you here.

361
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,196
No Starfleet officer
can do the job you do.

362
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:04,266
You've got that straight.

363
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,281
But you have to realize
that Starfleet

364
00:19:06,315 --> 00:19:08,684
is not going to take command
of a station in deep space

365
00:19:08,788 --> 00:19:11,352
without assigning some security
to protect its interests.

366
00:19:11,394 --> 00:19:13,627
Understandable.

367
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,569
You're going to have to work
with Primmin.

368
00:19:15,604 --> 00:19:17,905
The two of you have to find
a way to get along.

369
00:19:17,943 --> 00:19:19,708
Tell him that.

370
00:19:19,747 --> 00:19:21,718
I already have.

371
00:19:21,752 --> 00:19:23,586
Who's in charge?

372
00:19:23,623 --> 00:19:27,565
In joint operations
like this one...

373
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,502
you are.

374
00:19:31,274 --> 00:19:33,745
I can live
with that arrangement.

375
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:43,262
What have you got, Dax?

376
00:19:43,303 --> 00:19:44,772
I'm not exactly sure yet.

377
00:19:44,807 --> 00:19:46,367
I finished the sweep
of Kajada's ship.

378
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:48,712
No anomalous readings,
but I did notice one odd thing.

379
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,014
What's that?

380
00:19:50,053 --> 00:19:52,217
Someone tried to break
into the ship's cargo bay.

381
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:53,728
Since it's been docked?

382
00:19:53,762 --> 00:19:55,926
Kira confirmed
that there was no damage

383
00:19:55,967 --> 00:19:57,961
to the cargo area
when they brought it in.

384
00:19:58,006 --> 00:19:59,669
What do you think
they were after?

385
00:20:00,879 --> 00:20:02,143
This, maybe.

386
00:20:02,183 --> 00:20:06,090
I found it in Vantika's
personal belongings.

387
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,219
What is it?

388
00:20:07,261 --> 00:20:09,893
A map of the humanoid brain.

389
00:20:34,843 --> 00:20:36,871
You call this clean?

390
00:20:36,915 --> 00:20:39,318
I've already found three coins
on the floor up here.

391
00:20:39,355 --> 00:20:40,984
Who knows what else
there might be.

392
00:20:41,025 --> 00:20:43,121
Somebody may have lost
some valuable jewelry

393
00:20:43,164 --> 00:20:44,497
or something.

394
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,801
Fine.

395
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:48,433
Never mind.

396
00:20:48,476 --> 00:20:50,173
I'll do it myself.

397
00:20:50,214 --> 00:20:52,846
And I'll keep it myself.

398
00:20:52,887 --> 00:20:53,912
Leave!

399
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,166
You just can't find
good help anymore.

400
00:21:14,204 --> 00:21:18,009
Have you made
the preparations?

401
00:21:18,047 --> 00:21:19,175
Preparations?

402
00:21:19,216 --> 00:21:20,845
What preparations?

403
00:21:20,888 --> 00:21:23,121
The deuridium shipment.

404
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27,193
You were to hire
mercenaries to help me.

405
00:21:27,236 --> 00:21:28,865
Help you...

406
00:21:28,907 --> 00:21:32,039
but you can't be Vantika.

407
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,888
I told you to expect me
at this hour.

408
00:21:36,926 --> 00:21:38,327
Yes, and I contacted

409
00:21:38,362 --> 00:21:40,994
some very reliable
soldiers of fortune

410
00:21:41,036 --> 00:21:43,234
in anticipation of your arrival.

411
00:21:43,274 --> 00:21:46,908
But I was told you were dead.

412
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,582
Almost...

413
00:21:49,623 --> 00:21:52,289
but not quite.

414
00:22:11,976 --> 00:22:13,377
You wanted to see me?

415
00:22:13,413 --> 00:22:14,712
Kajada.

416
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,382
I'll be right with you.

417
00:22:17,423 --> 00:22:18,756
There.

418
00:22:18,793 --> 00:22:21,732
Now, remember, next time,
lift with your back straight

419
00:22:21,767 --> 00:22:23,965
and use the anti-gravity
generator.

420
00:22:24,005 --> 00:22:25,474
I'm sorry.
Come in.

421
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:27,742
I have the DNA scan results.

422
00:22:27,781 --> 00:22:30,345
I thought you might
like to see them.

423
00:22:30,387 --> 00:22:33,360
In fact, I tried
to call you last night.

424
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:36,060
But you never responded
to the com.

425
00:22:36,101 --> 00:22:39,074
Um, I have a little
trouble sleeping.

426
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,079
Last night was particularly bad

427
00:22:41,113 --> 00:22:43,813
so I used an alpha wave inducer
to help me.

428
00:22:43,853 --> 00:22:45,447
Oh, you should
be careful with those.

429
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,119
They're only meant
for occasional use.

430
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,960
The scan results, Doctor.

431
00:22:48,998 --> 00:22:50,695
Oh, yeah.

432
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:54,974
There wasn't even a trace
of diploid variation.

433
00:22:55,012 --> 00:22:57,074
It's definitely not a clone.

434
00:22:57,118 --> 00:23:00,650
Positive identification...
Rao Vantika.

435
00:23:00,693 --> 00:23:02,185
They must have
overlooked something.

436
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,358
Dax to Bashir.

437
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,200
Yes, Jadzia?

438
00:23:05,238 --> 00:23:06,537
I need some medical advice.

439
00:23:06,573 --> 00:23:07,701
Can you come to my lab?

440
00:23:07,743 --> 00:23:09,372
I'll be right there.

441
00:23:09,414 --> 00:23:10,747
Bashir out.

442
00:23:10,784 --> 00:23:14,190
Every conceivable test
has been done, Kajada.

443
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,790
Here's the hypothesis.

444
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:20,363
The body dies,
the consciousness lives on.

445
00:23:20,407 --> 00:23:21,637
In another brain?

446
00:23:21,677 --> 00:23:22,702
Possible?

447
00:23:22,746 --> 00:23:25,378
Well, the closest thing
I've encountered

448
00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:27,549
is synaptic pattern
displacement

449
00:23:27,591 --> 00:23:29,585
but that's never been done
by a non-Vulcan.

450
00:23:29,629 --> 00:23:31,600
I'm convinced Vantika
was working on it.

451
00:23:31,634 --> 00:23:32,967
There are over 70 different

452
00:23:33,003 --> 00:23:34,597
computer simulations
in his file.

453
00:23:34,641 --> 00:23:37,341
All involve identifying
neural energy patterns

454
00:23:37,381 --> 00:23:40,548
and storing them
in different areas of the brain.

455
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:42,560
Well, there's plenty of room.

456
00:23:42,594 --> 00:23:45,898
A humanoid only uses
a small portion of the brain.

457
00:23:45,935 --> 00:23:48,999
What if another entity
shared the unused portion?

458
00:23:49,042 --> 00:23:50,910
Hypothetically...

459
00:23:50,981 --> 00:23:54,923
Vantika's consciousness could be
occupying someone else's brain

460
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,861
while he waits
for the deuridium to arrive.

461
00:23:57,897 --> 00:24:00,164
But whose?

462
00:24:00,202 --> 00:24:02,766
Kajada.

463
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:04,277
They're both Kobliad.

464
00:24:04,312 --> 00:24:06,112
What better place to hide

465
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,485
than in the mind
of your worst enemy?

466
00:24:08,556 --> 00:24:09,991
It doesn't make sense.

467
00:24:10,026 --> 00:24:11,997
She's been doing
everything she can

468
00:24:12,031 --> 00:24:14,868
to convince us
that Vantika is alive.

469
00:24:14,904 --> 00:24:16,898
If Vantika's controlling her

470
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:19,310
why would he call
attention to himself?

471
00:24:19,348 --> 00:24:21,444
We're not suggesting
he's controlling her.

472
00:24:21,486 --> 00:24:23,457
This is all theoretical

473
00:24:23,491 --> 00:24:25,928
but to extend the logic,
there's no reason to believe

474
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:27,798
she'd even be aware
of his presence.

475
00:24:27,835 --> 00:24:30,740
Like a stowaway on a ship...
the pilot's at the helm

476
00:24:30,775 --> 00:24:33,076
but someone else
is along for the ride.

477
00:24:33,114 --> 00:24:36,520
Would an examination
of Kajada confirm any of this?

478
00:24:36,556 --> 00:24:39,050
We don't know
what we're looking for yet.

479
00:24:39,096 --> 00:24:41,567
We still have to identify
a method of transfer first.

480
00:24:41,601 --> 00:24:43,195
I could assign some personnel

481
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:46,771
to maintain continuous
surveillance on Kajada.

482
00:24:46,814 --> 00:24:48,614
We're already stretched
to the limit

483
00:24:48,652 --> 00:24:49,985
preparing for the shipment.

484
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:51,753
Why don't I just
set the computer

485
00:24:51,793 --> 00:24:54,357
to track her movements
and alert us if she goes

486
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:55,527
near a secured area?

487
00:24:55,568 --> 00:24:57,003
At the very least

488
00:24:57,072 --> 00:24:59,270
she has to be left out
of our security plans.

489
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,677
She won't like that.

490
00:25:00,714 --> 00:25:03,083
I'm afraid we have no choice.

491
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:04,281
What do we tell her?

492
00:25:04,322 --> 00:25:06,293
Nothing.
She'll figure it out.

493
00:25:06,327 --> 00:25:09,164
When she does, send her to me.

494
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:16,343
The computer security
codes have been changed.

495
00:25:16,385 --> 00:25:17,786
I've been denied access.

496
00:25:17,822 --> 00:25:18,950
Why?

497
00:25:18,991 --> 00:25:20,654
Because I ordered it.

498
00:25:20,695 --> 00:25:22,757
What kind of fool are you?

499
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,534
My own special variety.

500
00:25:25,574 --> 00:25:28,240
I'm the only one here
who has experience with Vantika.

501
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,339
I'm sorry.

502
00:25:29,382 --> 00:25:33,187
I believe it's necessary
at this point to restrict access

503
00:25:33,226 --> 00:25:35,697
to the security files
to four people:

504
00:25:35,731 --> 00:25:39,696
Myself, Lieutenant Primmin,
Major Kira and Commander Sisko.

505
00:25:41,913 --> 00:25:44,715
When is the shipment
scheduled to arrive?

506
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:47,122
I can't give you
that information.

507
00:25:49,164 --> 00:25:52,570
What about this Ferengi... Quark?

508
00:25:52,605 --> 00:25:54,199
What about him?

509
00:25:54,242 --> 00:25:55,711
From what I understand

510
00:25:55,746 --> 00:25:58,047
he has his hands
into everything around here.

511
00:25:58,084 --> 00:25:59,678
Is he under surveillance?

512
00:25:59,722 --> 00:26:02,193
I always keep an eye on him.

513
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:03,720
I hope so

514
00:26:03,765 --> 00:26:05,736
because he's exactly the kind

515
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,764
that Vantika would
use in his plans.

516
00:26:19,469 --> 00:26:21,998
Everything has been
taken care of.

517
00:26:22,042 --> 00:26:24,377
That's what you said
about the job on Vener VII.

518
00:26:24,414 --> 00:26:27,080
You should thank me
for Vener VII.

519
00:26:27,188 --> 00:26:28,885
You got paid, didn't you?

520
00:26:28,925 --> 00:26:31,089
We almost got killed.

521
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:34,001
A normal risk
in your line of work.

522
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:36,532
A normal risk
when we work for you.

523
00:26:36,577 --> 00:26:37,944
That's for certain.

524
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,250
So, when do we
meet this Kobliad?

525
00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:44,126
When he decides
it's appropriate.

526
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:46,861
All right, then,
a better question...

527
00:26:46,902 --> 00:26:49,568
when do we get paid?

528
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:53,310
When the job is completed,
of course.

529
00:26:53,351 --> 00:26:54,718
Not acceptable.

530
00:26:54,753 --> 00:26:58,159
We'll require an advance payment
of 70%.

531
00:26:58,195 --> 00:27:00,462
Durg, wake up.

532
00:27:00,501 --> 00:27:02,995
This is Quark
you're talking to, remember?

533
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:07,574
All past debts
have been settled.

534
00:27:07,617 --> 00:27:09,109
They'll never be settled.

535
00:27:09,189 --> 00:27:11,456
You'd still be rotting
in a Cardassian jail

536
00:27:11,494 --> 00:27:12,724
if I hadn't...

537
00:27:33,117 --> 00:27:34,450
Can you speak?

538
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:37,289
Pushed.

539
00:27:37,327 --> 00:27:38,921
Vantika.

540
00:27:38,964 --> 00:27:41,903
I can't keep her conscious
any longer, Commander.

541
00:27:41,937 --> 00:27:43,737
If she moves too much

542
00:27:43,776 --> 00:27:46,009
she could suffer
permanent paralysis.

543
00:27:46,047 --> 00:27:48,177
Did you see anybody
behind her?

544
00:27:48,219 --> 00:27:51,921
I just heard the scream
and looked up.

545
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,521
She fell from the balcony.

546
00:27:53,566 --> 00:27:55,537
What was she doing
up there, anyway?

547
00:27:55,571 --> 00:27:57,474
She had an odd feeling
you might be

548
00:27:57,508 --> 00:28:00,106
helping someone hijack
this deuridium shipment.

549
00:28:00,148 --> 00:28:01,207
I resent the inference.

550
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,240
It's not an inference.

551
00:28:02,287 --> 00:28:03,517
It's a definite suspicion.

552
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,528
Was anyone else in the bar?

553
00:28:05,561 --> 00:28:07,030
Anyone else?

554
00:28:07,065 --> 00:28:09,195
At the time of the accident.

555
00:28:09,237 --> 00:28:10,205
No, just me.

556
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:11,264
Just tidying up

557
00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:14,214
which, if you'll excuse me,
I really must finish.

558
00:28:14,249 --> 00:28:15,878
Not so fast, Quark.

559
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,892
I want to take a look
at that third floor

560
00:28:18,926 --> 00:28:21,420
before you get rid
of all the evidence.

561
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:22,765
Be my guest

562
00:28:22,803 --> 00:28:25,776
but I'm telling you,
she was alone up there.

563
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:28,476
And she had no business
invading the privacy

564
00:28:28,517 --> 00:28:31,081
of a law-abiding member
of the community.

565
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:33,994
What do you think, Doctor?

566
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:35,794
Could this have been
a suicide attempt?

567
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:37,667
Well, I haven't
noticed any indication

568
00:28:37,704 --> 00:28:39,675
of suicidal behavior,
but then, who knows

569
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:42,807
what the effect of sharing
one's brain might be.

570
00:28:42,884 --> 00:28:45,014
I'd still like
some confirmation of that.

571
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,027
I'll have to tend
to her injuries

572
00:28:47,061 --> 00:28:49,032
before I conduct
any brain scan.

573
00:28:49,065 --> 00:28:50,329
But until we find

574
00:28:50,368 --> 00:28:52,498
the transfer method
Vantika used

575
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,977
I'm not even sure
what to look for.

576
00:28:55,013 --> 00:28:57,382
Computer, location
of Lieutenant Dax.

577
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:00,221
Lieutenant Dax
is in the stasis room.

578
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,422
Find something
under his fingernails?

579
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,827
Not yet.

580
00:29:15,896 --> 00:29:17,833
What are you looking for?

581
00:29:17,901 --> 00:29:20,499
Confirmation of a theory,
I hope.

582
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,511
I've been asking myself

583
00:29:22,545 --> 00:29:25,039
why would anyone induct
a bioelectrical charge

584
00:29:25,085 --> 00:29:26,714
into a glial cell?

585
00:29:26,756 --> 00:29:29,091
A question I have
always wondered about.

586
00:29:29,128 --> 00:29:30,563
Well, it might make sense

587
00:29:30,598 --> 00:29:32,626
if you wanted to send
a bio-coded message

588
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,141
along the glial cells
of someone's nervous system

589
00:29:35,176 --> 00:29:36,440
all the way to the brain.

590
00:29:36,479 --> 00:29:38,108
My guess is

591
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,881
that's what Vantika
was trying to do.

592
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,389
Using his fingernails?

593
00:29:41,425 --> 00:29:43,828
Frankly, I can't think
of another way

594
00:29:43,863 --> 00:29:46,096
he could have delivered
the bio-coded message.

595
00:29:46,135 --> 00:29:49,267
He must have used
a very weak electrical charge

596
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,546
or the sensors on Kajada's ship
would have detected it.

597
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:55,854
Ideally, he would have injected

598
00:29:55,892 --> 00:29:58,888
the bio-coded message directly
into his victim's skin

599
00:29:58,933 --> 00:30:01,404
but there were
no hyposprays or needles

600
00:30:01,438 --> 00:30:03,306
anywhere on the ship.

601
00:30:07,955 --> 00:30:09,926
A microscopic generator.

602
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:12,430
You're suggesting he
stored his consciousness

603
00:30:12,465 --> 00:30:13,934
in that thing?

604
00:30:13,969 --> 00:30:17,432
His neural patterns encoded
as bioelectrical pulses.

605
00:30:17,477 --> 00:30:21,179
He could have placed that device
under his nail months ago

606
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,783
just in case he needed an escape
route in an emergency...

607
00:30:23,826 --> 00:30:25,797
his last resort before death.

608
00:30:25,831 --> 00:30:28,132
Will this show up
in Kajada?

609
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:30,641
Now that we know
what we're looking for

610
00:30:30,675 --> 00:30:34,480
we should be able to confirm it
with a glial scan.

611
00:30:34,518 --> 00:30:37,150
Do it as soon as Bashir
stabilizes her.

612
00:30:37,191 --> 00:30:38,353
Nice work.

613
00:30:46,681 --> 00:30:49,313
Confirm that each
distribution amplifier

614
00:30:49,353 --> 00:30:51,517
is at 100% efficiency.

615
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:54,589
If there's more
than a.03% fall-off

616
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:55,727
replace it.

617
00:30:55,768 --> 00:30:57,499
And that won't mean a thing

618
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,943
if the power waveguide
outlets fail.

619
00:30:59,979 --> 00:31:01,073
Double-check them.

620
00:31:01,148 --> 00:31:02,549
You better make this
the last check.

621
00:31:02,585 --> 00:31:03,644
We've only got an hour.

622
00:31:03,688 --> 00:31:04,747
Where's Primmin?

623
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,259
I thought he was with you.

624
00:31:06,294 --> 00:31:08,390
I sent him to help you make

625
00:31:08,432 --> 00:31:10,562
the final security sweep
of the docking area.

626
00:31:10,604 --> 00:31:12,871
He has not been here
all morning.

627
00:31:17,955 --> 00:31:19,926
I won't be going with you.

628
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,865
I'm simply a middleman,
a facilitator.

629
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,871
A profit monger.

630
00:31:24,905 --> 00:31:26,705
And proud of it.

631
00:31:26,743 --> 00:31:31,483
How did you get your hands
on a Federation runabout, Quark?

632
00:31:31,521 --> 00:31:33,958
I can't take credit for that.

633
00:31:33,994 --> 00:31:36,488
Your employer
has somehow managed

634
00:31:36,533 --> 00:31:38,663
to arrange security access.

635
00:31:41,411 --> 00:31:44,874
When do we meet this employer?

636
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,793
His message said he'd be
waiting for us on board.

637
00:31:51,603 --> 00:31:53,574
Uh...

638
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:55,578
uh, I'm terribly sorry.

639
00:31:55,612 --> 00:31:58,744
We seem to have made
a wrong turn.

640
00:31:58,787 --> 00:32:00,917
We-we didn't mean
to disturb you

641
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:02,428
Doctor.

642
00:32:08,643 --> 00:32:11,241
Not at all, gentlemen.

643
00:32:11,283 --> 00:32:14,587
I've been expecting you.

644
00:32:22,242 --> 00:32:24,440
Julian?

645
00:32:27,622 --> 00:32:30,493
Computer,
location of Dr. Bashir.

646
00:32:30,529 --> 00:32:34,061
Dr. Bashir is in the Infirmary.

647
00:32:46,935 --> 00:32:49,429
What the hell are
you doing in there?

648
00:32:49,474 --> 00:32:52,208
I told you to sweep
the docking bay again.

649
00:32:52,314 --> 00:32:54,217
I took a cue from you.

650
00:32:54,286 --> 00:32:56,086
From me?

651
00:32:56,124 --> 00:32:59,097
You understood the logic
of Vantika's MO

652
00:32:59,131 --> 00:33:01,968
when he downloaded
the computer memory...

653
00:33:02,005 --> 00:33:04,944
avoid the single file,
attack the system.

654
00:33:04,978 --> 00:33:07,415
I'm not following.

655
00:33:07,451 --> 00:33:10,015
Vantika has to know
that all of our security efforts

656
00:33:10,057 --> 00:33:11,857
will be focused
on the docking ring.

657
00:33:11,895 --> 00:33:13,057
And?

658
00:33:13,097 --> 00:33:14,794
I figured,
if he holds true to form

659
00:33:14,835 --> 00:33:16,669
that's not where
he'll try to hurt us.

660
00:33:16,706 --> 00:33:18,802
So I ran a diagnostic
on all the systems

661
00:33:18,844 --> 00:33:21,213
that could shut down
our whole defense array.

662
00:33:21,318 --> 00:33:22,878
I've already done
that twice today.

663
00:33:22,921 --> 00:33:25,119
I know. I didn't find
anything, either.

664
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,222
But then I went
to the backup systems

665
00:33:27,298 --> 00:33:29,998
and I found a glitch there
I couldn't explain.

666
00:33:30,038 --> 00:33:33,945
And I tracked it back
to the waste reclamation system

667
00:33:33,982 --> 00:33:36,784
where nobody would ever
think to look

668
00:33:36,822 --> 00:33:39,659
because it's considered
nonessential.

669
00:33:39,695 --> 00:33:41,187
And I found this.

670
00:33:41,232 --> 00:33:42,997
Another subspace
crossover shunt

671
00:33:43,036 --> 00:33:44,733
just like the one Vantika used

672
00:33:44,774 --> 00:33:46,608
when he tapped
into the computer.

673
00:33:46,645 --> 00:33:48,274
And it's set to feed back

674
00:33:48,383 --> 00:33:51,481
into the primary command
and control functions.

675
00:33:53,395 --> 00:33:56,391
This would have shut us
down for close to an hour.

676
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:58,804
Long enough for him
to grab that freighter

677
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,674
and warp it to who knows where.

678
00:34:08,063 --> 00:34:09,259
Yes, Major?

679
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:11,429
The <i>Norkova's</i> just come
through the wormhole.

680
00:34:11,471 --> 00:34:13,100
Requesting permission to dock.

681
00:34:13,141 --> 00:34:14,975
Let's go to
a Security Alert Yellow.

682
00:34:15,013 --> 00:34:17,280
What bay do you
have assigned in the plan?

683
00:34:17,352 --> 00:34:18,548
Number Eight.

684
00:34:18,588 --> 00:34:19,716
Odo...

685
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:22,856
maintain a visible contingent
of security at Bay Eight.

686
00:34:22,898 --> 00:34:25,700
But I'm sending the <i>Norkova</i>
to the second backup.

687
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:27,072
Bay 12.

688
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:29,273
I'll send
additional forces to 12.

689
00:34:29,314 --> 00:34:32,185
Commander, your
Lieutenant Primmin there

690
00:34:32,221 --> 00:34:33,815
just saved us all
a lot of problems.

691
00:34:33,858 --> 00:34:36,422
Another subspace crossover
that would have crippled us

692
00:34:36,464 --> 00:34:38,958
long enough for them to
escape with your deuridium.

693
00:34:39,004 --> 00:34:41,271
Odo, did you deploy
a runabout

694
00:34:41,309 --> 00:34:42,744
to escort the <i>Norkova?</i>

695
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,340
No.

696
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:47,550
Then how come the <i>Rio Grande's</i>
going out to meet it?

697
00:34:47,591 --> 00:34:49,425
On screen.

698
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:57,944
Benjamin, Julian's missing.

699
00:34:57,982 --> 00:34:59,076
Missing?

700
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,283
His combadge
was in the infirmary.

701
00:35:01,324 --> 00:35:02,452
I can't find him anywhere.

702
00:35:02,493 --> 00:35:04,691
Computer, who authorized access

703
00:35:04,732 --> 00:35:06,896
to the Runabout <i>Rio Grande?</i>

704
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,706
Authorization:
Access code 4-1-2-1.

705
00:35:09,744 --> 00:35:11,738
Dr. Julian Bashir.

706
00:35:46,661 --> 00:35:48,221
It's safe.

707
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:03,129
Shields up.

708
00:36:03,168 --> 00:36:04,296
Done.

709
00:36:05,473 --> 00:36:07,637
Secure the rest of the ship.

710
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:11,644
Be sure to account
for all 12 members of the crew.

711
00:36:11,721 --> 00:36:13,783
If they resist, kill them.

712
00:36:13,827 --> 00:36:16,060
Enter the new course.

713
00:36:16,098 --> 00:36:18,092
Aye.

714
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:26,150
The station has locked
a tractor beam on us.

715
00:36:26,189 --> 00:36:28,490
But that's not possible.

716
00:36:28,529 --> 00:36:31,400
They should be shut down by now.

717
00:36:31,436 --> 00:36:33,703
Well, they're not.

718
00:36:33,808 --> 00:36:35,870
They're hailing us.

719
00:36:35,913 --> 00:36:39,183
Hailing... us?

720
00:36:39,221 --> 00:36:42,194
Engage engines, full impulse.

721
00:36:42,228 --> 00:36:45,691
We're not going anywhere
with a tractor beam on us.

722
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:47,502
Do it!

723
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:51,209
Full impulse engaged.

724
00:36:51,249 --> 00:36:53,220
The tractor beam is holding.

725
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:57,059
But they won't be able
to pull us in.

726
00:36:57,097 --> 00:37:00,264
We can't just sit here
and wait.

727
00:37:00,305 --> 00:37:03,541
What do you intend to do?

728
00:37:05,718 --> 00:37:07,848
Open a channel.

729
00:37:10,663 --> 00:37:15,038
I'm Benjamin Sisko,
Commander of DS9.

730
00:37:15,074 --> 00:37:18,674
Rao Vantika is my name.

731
00:37:23,894 --> 00:37:28,770
But I assume you
know that already.

732
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:32,143
I want to talk to Dr. Bashir.

733
00:37:32,181 --> 00:37:36,989
Unfortunately, he's not
available at the moment.

734
00:37:37,026 --> 00:37:38,495
Is he all right?

735
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:43,098
His body is...
how do you humans say it?

736
00:37:43,141 --> 00:37:45,635
Fit as a fiddle.

737
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:49,520
Looks rather good on me,
don't you think?

738
00:37:49,556 --> 00:37:51,823
What have you done
to his mind, Vantika?

739
00:37:51,861 --> 00:37:57,830
It was necessary to render him
unconscious for the time being.

740
00:37:57,876 --> 00:38:00,440
However, I might consider

741
00:38:00,482 --> 00:38:04,982
leaving his body
and returning him to you.

742
00:38:05,027 --> 00:38:07,795
But first, you must release

743
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,631
your tractor beam.

744
00:38:09,671 --> 00:38:11,072
I can't do that.

745
00:38:11,108 --> 00:38:15,676
If you don't,
I'll take this vessel to warp.

746
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:17,747
The tractor beam
would rip apart your ship.

747
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:20,057
And you and everybody on board
would be killed.

748
00:38:20,096 --> 00:38:22,158
Exactly.

749
00:38:22,201 --> 00:38:28,205
So if you care at all
about the welfare of your doctor

750
00:38:28,249 --> 00:38:31,849
you will release
your hold on us.

751
00:38:31,924 --> 00:38:35,056
You have one minute to decide.

752
00:38:36,201 --> 00:38:39,573
Can we get
a transporter lock on him?

753
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:41,876
Negative.
Their shields are up.

754
00:38:41,948 --> 00:38:43,247
Suggestions?

755
00:38:43,285 --> 00:38:44,982
A small ship like a runabout

756
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:46,890
might be able
to get close enough

757
00:38:46,993 --> 00:38:49,089
to overload
their shield generators

758
00:38:49,132 --> 00:38:50,692
with directed phaser fire.

759
00:38:50,735 --> 00:38:53,264
We used to do it to Cardassian
freighters all the time.

760
00:38:53,309 --> 00:38:55,280
But you'd be risking
a hull breach

761
00:38:55,314 --> 00:38:57,512
and with all the deuridium
on board...

762
00:38:57,619 --> 00:38:58,849
He's right.

763
00:38:58,889 --> 00:39:02,193
We can't risk releasing
deuridium into the system.

764
00:39:02,231 --> 00:39:05,398
Every populated area
would have to be evacuated.

765
00:39:05,438 --> 00:39:07,875
Dax, is there
any way to disrupt

766
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,881
Vantika's control over Bashir?

767
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:11,441
I have an exact model

768
00:39:11,485 --> 00:39:13,786
of Vantika's
neural energy patterns.

769
00:39:13,825 --> 00:39:16,389
If I can design
an electromagnetic pulse

770
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:18,127
to disrupt those patterns

771
00:39:18,168 --> 00:39:19,467
Julian might emerge.

772
00:39:19,505 --> 00:39:22,342
We still need a way
to get it there.

773
00:39:22,379 --> 00:39:24,714
Could we run it
along the tractor beam

774
00:39:24,751 --> 00:39:26,084
at the same frequency

775
00:39:26,121 --> 00:39:27,249
as their shields?

776
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:29,660
The pulse would resonate
off the shields

777
00:39:29,696 --> 00:39:32,601
and create a reflected EM
field inside the ship.

778
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:34,265
He's hailing us.

779
00:39:34,307 --> 00:39:36,107
I need some time.

780
00:39:36,145 --> 00:39:39,243
I'll give you as much as I can.
On screen.

781
00:39:39,285 --> 00:39:41,313
Have you decided?

782
00:39:41,357 --> 00:39:43,122
If I permit you to leave

783
00:39:43,162 --> 00:39:45,726
what guarantee do I have
that you'll return Dr. Bashir?

784
00:39:45,767 --> 00:39:50,233
Oh, you're far too ready
to capitulate, Commander.

785
00:39:50,279 --> 00:39:55,383
Would you be planning
a rescue attempt, perhaps?

786
00:39:55,424 --> 00:39:57,953
I'm only interested
in the safety of my doctor.

787
00:39:57,998 --> 00:40:00,800
You insult my intelligence.

788
00:40:00,837 --> 00:40:02,899
Prepare to go to warp.

789
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,847
You've gone to great lengths
to survive, Vantika.

790
00:40:05,883 --> 00:40:08,583
I don't think you're ready
to kill yourself.

791
00:40:08,622 --> 00:40:12,792
And I don't think you are ready

792
00:40:12,832 --> 00:40:18,369
to risk spreading deuridium
all over this system.

793
00:40:21,954 --> 00:40:25,360
Ready to engage warp engines.

794
00:40:25,396 --> 00:40:26,831
You must be crazy!

795
00:40:26,866 --> 00:40:28,894
I want no part of this!

796
00:40:33,315 --> 00:40:37,222
No more middlemen, Sisko.

797
00:40:37,257 --> 00:40:39,057
No more delays.

798
00:40:43,372 --> 00:40:45,843
What's it to be?

799
00:40:45,878 --> 00:40:47,815
All right.

800
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:50,253
We're prepared to release
the tractor beam.

801
00:40:50,289 --> 00:40:51,758
Dax?

802
00:40:51,793 --> 00:40:53,353
Ready.

803
00:40:53,396 --> 00:40:54,888
Do it!

804
00:41:05,759 --> 00:41:07,092
Dr. Bashir!

805
00:41:07,129 --> 00:41:08,723
Answer me.

806
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,235
Bashir!

807
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:13,837
Yes?

808
00:41:13,879 --> 00:41:15,109
What?

809
00:41:15,182 --> 00:41:18,019
Doctor, lower the shields!

810
00:41:18,055 --> 00:41:20,219
What?

811
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:21,628
What... what shields?

812
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,894
Where am I?

813
00:41:22,934 --> 00:41:24,301
I'll explain later.

814
00:41:24,337 --> 00:41:26,501
Lower the shields now!

815
00:41:35,063 --> 00:41:36,396
The shields are down.

816
00:41:36,433 --> 00:41:37,458
Get him out of there!

817
00:41:37,502 --> 00:41:38,492
Energizing.

818
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:48,688
It's okay.

819
00:41:48,729 --> 00:41:50,096
It's...

820
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,761
me.

821
00:42:04,482 --> 00:42:06,680
I've programmed
this transporter

822
00:42:06,721 --> 00:42:10,993
to isolate any glial cells with
Vantika's neural patterns...

823
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:13,765
and to beam them from Julian

824
00:42:13,804 --> 00:42:16,572
into this
micro-containment field.

825
00:42:22,593 --> 00:42:25,829
Once they're out,
he should be back to normal.

826
00:43:04,059 --> 00:43:06,588
I'm only reading
human neural patterns.

827
00:43:06,631 --> 00:43:07,964
He's clear.

828
00:43:23,806 --> 00:43:27,645
Oh, I have the worst headache.

829
00:43:41,348 --> 00:43:44,720
Dr. Bashir, I'm so sorry
for all of this.

830
00:43:44,756 --> 00:43:46,784
Well, I suppose we should
have listened to you

831
00:43:46,827 --> 00:43:48,855
when you said he was alive.

832
00:43:48,899 --> 00:43:50,767
There was no way
for you to control

833
00:43:50,804 --> 00:43:52,171
what he was doing to you.

834
00:43:52,207 --> 00:43:55,943
I'm afraid I don't remember it.

835
00:43:55,983 --> 00:43:59,287
Actually, I feel
quite humiliated.

836
00:43:59,324 --> 00:44:01,158
No one blames you, Doctor.

837
00:44:01,196 --> 00:44:03,599
It wasn't you.

838
00:44:03,635 --> 00:44:05,538
It was that.

839
00:44:05,573 --> 00:44:08,740
What do you intend to do
with it?

840
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:11,378
May I assume that you've
returned custody

841
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,891
of the prisoner to me,
Commander Sisko?

842
00:44:13,926 --> 00:44:15,259
The prisoner?

843
00:44:15,296 --> 00:44:16,663
What's left of him.

844
00:44:16,699 --> 00:44:18,259
Good.
