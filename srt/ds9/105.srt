1
00:00:11,552 --> 00:00:13,523
Look, save your energy.

2
00:00:13,557 --> 00:00:17,191
We'll have you out of there
as soon as possible.

3
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:19,227
I hope.

4
00:00:21,576 --> 00:00:24,413
Try rerouting
the power coupling.

5
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,820
Mr. O'Brien.

6
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,334
See if you can activate
the interlock servos.

7
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:33,998
Mr. O'Brien.

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,776
Captain Jaheel, those people
have been stuck in that air lock

9
00:00:37,816 --> 00:00:38,944
for over an hour.

10
00:00:38,985 --> 00:00:41,149
Now, if you can wait
till we get that door opened

11
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:43,628
I'll be happy to listen
to any problems you might have.

12
00:00:43,663 --> 00:00:45,257
But I've already
been waiting two days

13
00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:46,529
for your people to readjust

14
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,130
my ship's antimatter
flow converter.

15
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,870
I'm afraid we've
gotten a little behind

16
00:00:49,911 --> 00:00:51,175
in our maintenance schedule.

17
00:00:51,215 --> 00:00:52,878
I'm not interested
in hearing excuses.

18
00:00:52,918 --> 00:00:54,718
I have a shipment
of Tamen Sahsheer

19
00:00:54,757 --> 00:00:56,557
waiting to be
delivered to Largo V

20
00:00:56,594 --> 00:00:58,758
and I'll need to do
better than warp 1

21
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:00,393
to get there
before it spoils.

22
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:03,034
I'll try to get a repair crew
to you by the end of the day.

23
00:01:03,076 --> 00:01:05,844
Now, that's
the best I can do.

24
00:01:05,883 --> 00:01:08,651
Your best, Mr. O'Brien,
hardly seems good enough.

25
00:01:11,563 --> 00:01:13,260
Dax to O'Brien.

26
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:14,803
O'Brien here.

27
00:01:14,838 --> 00:01:16,900
Can you spare a minute, Chief?

28
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:19,848
I have a little problem
here at the lab.

29
00:01:19,883 --> 00:01:21,979
On my way.

30
00:01:27,802 --> 00:01:29,830
Thanks for coming, Chief.

31
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:31,970
What are you doing out here?

32
00:01:38,327 --> 00:01:40,856
Have you checked
the EPS converter?

33
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,335
Yes... first thing.

34
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:44,032
How about the intensity grid?

35
00:01:44,075 --> 00:01:45,169
It's fine.

36
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,910
Then it's probably the secondary
phase modulator.

37
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,818
We had trouble
with them last week

38
00:01:49,855 --> 00:01:51,222
in the main power core.

39
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,722
That should do it.

40
00:02:00,013 --> 00:02:02,280
Anything else
I can do for you?

41
00:02:04,356 --> 00:02:05,882
The navigational computer

42
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:08,228
hasn't worked reliably
for three days.

43
00:02:08,265 --> 00:02:11,295
I ask for the star charts
for the Argosian sector

44
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,334
Glessene sector
comes up instead.

45
00:02:13,377 --> 00:02:16,350
That's when I can coax
this system on line.

46
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:17,752
Uh-huh.

47
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:19,817
Try it now.

48
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:24,897
Ah! That's more like it.

49
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,961
You look like you
could use some sleep.

50
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:37,400
Who has time for sleep?

51
00:02:37,435 --> 00:02:41,969
I'd settle for five minutes
peace and quiet.

52
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:46,417
Chief, I thought you were going

53
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,860
to fix the replicators.

54
00:02:48,896 --> 00:02:51,129
You're absolutely right, sir.

55
00:02:51,168 --> 00:02:53,105
I knew I'd
forgotten something.

56
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,974
Can't have the
Operations Chief

57
00:02:55,011 --> 00:02:56,310
sitting around daydreaming

58
00:02:56,348 --> 00:02:59,014
when there's work
to be done, can we?

59
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,788
Ho, ho, ho, ho.
I'll get right on it.

60
00:03:01,827 --> 00:03:04,925
"Fix the replicators, Chief."

61
00:03:04,968 --> 00:03:07,201
"My console's off-line, Chief."

62
00:03:08,242 --> 00:03:11,113
I should have transferred
to a cargo drone...

63
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,450
no people, no complaints.

64
00:03:53,718 --> 00:03:56,452
Hot coffee...
black, double sweet.

65
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,680
Tell me, Quark.

66
00:06:27,718 --> 00:06:32,184
Am I mistaken, or is business
a little slow today?

67
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:34,530
Slow? It's been
almost nonexistent

68
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:37,336
for the past three days.

69
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,537
Mmm. Who knows?

70
00:06:38,644 --> 00:06:40,204
If things don't improve

71
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:42,345
you may be forced
to close down.

72
00:06:42,387 --> 00:06:44,449
Oh, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

73
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:47,795
Well, let's just say,
without you around

74
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,304
my job would be
considerably easier.

75
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:52,810
Without me around,
you'd be forced

76
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:56,081
to find some other poor
innocent to persecute.

77
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,591
Think about that
while you sit here

78
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,425
gloating at my misfortune.

79
00:07:00,464 --> 00:07:01,797
Quark!

80
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:04,203
You call this Kohlanese stew?

81
00:07:09,218 --> 00:07:11,816
If your meal
isn't satisfactory

82
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:14,558
I'm sure we could,
uh, exchange it

83
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:16,967
for something
more to your liking.

84
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,567
Aren't you the
least bit curious

85
00:07:19,643 --> 00:07:21,705
as to how it tastes?

86
00:07:24,287 --> 00:07:26,953
Ugh! Ugh!

87
00:07:26,994 --> 00:07:28,520
Now...

88
00:07:28,564 --> 00:07:30,033
you served it.

89
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:31,559
You're going to eat it.

90
00:07:31,604 --> 00:07:33,267
All right, that's enough.

91
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:34,903
I said, eat it!

92
00:07:37,653 --> 00:07:40,056
I said...

93
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:41,720
that's enough.

94
00:07:41,763 --> 00:07:43,426
Leave him alone.

95
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:52,287
Well,
another satisfied customer.

96
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:54,258
It's these replicators.

97
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:58,165
If I don't get them fixed soon,
they'll destroy my business.

98
00:07:58,202 --> 00:08:00,639
Why not get O'Brien
to fix them?

99
00:08:00,674 --> 00:08:03,772
He has the replicators on the
command level working perfectly.

100
00:08:03,815 --> 00:08:06,218
I'm on his waiting list.

101
00:08:06,255 --> 00:08:09,627
He assures me he'll get to them
as soon as he can.

102
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:11,064
Mmm...

103
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,629
No telling when that will be.

104
00:08:13,705 --> 00:08:16,176
The Chief's a very busy man.

105
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:23,221
Computer...

106
00:08:23,262 --> 00:08:25,665
display a station layout.

107
00:08:25,734 --> 00:08:30,040
Highlight locations
of all repaired replicators

108
00:08:30,078 --> 00:08:31,946
on command level.

109
00:08:31,983 --> 00:08:33,817
Information restricted

110
00:08:33,853 --> 00:08:36,347
to security clearance 5
and above.

111
00:08:36,393 --> 00:08:38,056
Please enter
security verification.

112
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:56,103
Clearance verified.

113
00:09:06,867 --> 00:09:08,393
There you go, sir.

114
00:09:08,437 --> 00:09:11,569
I think you'll find that
more to your liking.

115
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:14,014
Very much appreciated,
Mr. O'Brien.

116
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,987
Don't mention it, sir.

117
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:18,356
Unfortunately, there
are plenty of replicators

118
00:09:18,394 --> 00:09:20,159
around the station
that still need looking after.

119
00:09:20,198 --> 00:09:23,137
You all right, Chief?

120
00:09:23,172 --> 00:09:24,835
I'm just a bit hot.

121
00:09:24,876 --> 00:09:26,710
The environmental controls

122
00:09:26,747 --> 00:09:27,841
must be acting up again.

123
00:09:27,883 --> 00:09:29,375
Send my regards
to Mrs. O'Brien.

124
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,254
Jake tells me
she's a wonderful teacher.

125
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:32,625
Oh, that's nice to hear, sir.

126
00:09:32,662 --> 00:09:34,599
She's flower units
about the lad herself.

127
00:09:34,632 --> 00:09:36,033
Excuse me?

128
00:09:36,069 --> 00:09:37,436
Sir?

129
00:09:37,473 --> 00:09:39,501
What was that
you just said?

130
00:09:39,544 --> 00:09:44,078
She's... quite fond
of the lad herself.

131
00:09:44,122 --> 00:09:45,557
Oh.

132
00:09:45,593 --> 00:09:47,085
I'm glad to hear it.

133
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,123
Very good, sir.

134
00:09:56,752 --> 00:09:58,517
Ladies.

135
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,824
Hello, Lieutenant.

136
00:10:00,896 --> 00:10:03,630
Oh, I forgot
how different it was.

137
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,572
How different what was?

138
00:10:05,607 --> 00:10:07,133
Being female.

139
00:10:07,177 --> 00:10:09,775
I haven't been one
for over 80 years.

140
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,845
All this attention.

141
00:10:11,922 --> 00:10:14,086
Imagine it must take
some getting used to.

142
00:10:14,128 --> 00:10:15,859
Actually,
I find it quite enjoyable.

143
00:10:15,932 --> 00:10:17,265
Major Kira.

144
00:10:17,302 --> 00:10:18,737
Lieutenant Dax.

145
00:10:18,772 --> 00:10:21,870
I'd be honored to have you
join my little party...

146
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,643
as my guests, of course.

147
00:10:23,684 --> 00:10:25,347
What's all this, Quark?

148
00:10:25,387 --> 00:10:27,985
You cheat your
1,000th customer?

149
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,829
Who says Bajorans
don't have a sense of humor?

150
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:33,704
Actually, uh, we're
celebrating the repair

151
00:10:33,741 --> 00:10:36,212
of the bar's
replicator system.

152
00:10:36,246 --> 00:10:39,550
Perhaps I could interest you

153
00:10:39,588 --> 00:10:43,495
in a nice, double-whipped,
I'danian spice pudding.

154
00:10:43,531 --> 00:10:45,468
Oh, what do you think?

155
00:10:45,502 --> 00:10:47,598
I think I'm due back at Ops

156
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:49,110
but, uh, go on.

157
00:10:49,145 --> 00:10:50,614
Enjoy yourself.

158
00:11:01,775 --> 00:11:03,712
Chief?

159
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,944
How can I help you, Major?

160
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:11,152
Looks like you're the one
who could use a little help.

161
00:11:11,197 --> 00:11:13,726
Oh, no, I'm fine, really.

162
00:11:17,245 --> 00:11:19,580
I suppose this isn't
a good time to tell you

163
00:11:19,617 --> 00:11:22,385
that number three turbolift
has broken down again.

164
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:28,730
Joking, Chief.

165
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:32,509
Major, lark's true pepper.

166
00:11:32,548 --> 00:11:33,881
What?

167
00:11:35,857 --> 00:11:38,887
Let birds go
further loose maybe.

168
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,667
Shout easy play.

169
00:11:42,706 --> 00:11:44,734
Chief, you're not
making any sense.

170
00:11:44,778 --> 00:11:46,942
Round the turbulent quick.

171
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:53,393
Well, close
the reverse harbor.

172
00:11:56,506 --> 00:12:00,539
A-Ankle try sound.

173
00:12:00,582 --> 00:12:02,678
Reset gleaming.

174
00:12:04,993 --> 00:12:07,430
Dinner to bug.

175
00:12:09,304 --> 00:12:11,298
Chief, wait.

176
00:12:11,341 --> 00:12:12,970
When?

177
00:12:13,012 --> 00:12:14,345
Chief.

178
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:30,550
Computer,
continue neural imaging scan

179
00:12:30,587 --> 00:12:32,922
and stimulate visual cortex.

180
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,489
All visual responses normal.

181
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:42,271
Begin auditory stimuli.

182
00:12:42,316 --> 00:12:44,845
No physiological damage.

183
00:12:44,888 --> 00:12:48,420
All brain functions
within normal parameters.

184
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:49,431
Nurse.

185
00:12:49,466 --> 00:12:50,765
Yes?

186
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,363
Will you pull up Mr. O'Brien's

187
00:12:52,407 --> 00:12:54,275
neurophysiological
history, please?

188
00:12:54,312 --> 00:12:55,302
Yes, Doctor.

189
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,009
What is that?

190
00:13:04,043 --> 00:13:05,444
What's he written?

191
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,574
I wish I knew.

192
00:13:06,616 --> 00:13:08,712
Strike limits

193
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,749
flame the dark true salt.

194
00:13:10,793 --> 00:13:12,764
Please, Chief, take a seat.

195
00:13:12,797 --> 00:13:14,266
Way link complete.

196
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,963
Way link!

197
00:13:17,642 --> 00:13:20,274
What's wrong with him?

198
00:13:20,315 --> 00:13:22,786
He appears to suffering
from a form of aphasia.

199
00:13:22,888 --> 00:13:24,791
It's a perceptual
dysfunction

200
00:13:24,826 --> 00:13:26,227
in which aural
and visual stimuli

201
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,926
are incorrectly processed
by the brain.

202
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:30,029
His actual thinking
hasn't been affected

203
00:13:30,073 --> 00:13:32,442
but he's incapable
of expressing himself

204
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,472
or understanding others.

205
00:13:34,516 --> 00:13:38,481
Victory strike
limits frosted wake.

206
00:13:38,525 --> 00:13:42,831
Simple hesitation.

207
00:13:42,902 --> 00:13:45,169
I'm not sure I follow you,
Doctor.

208
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:46,303
You say Mr. O'Brien is aphasiac

209
00:13:46,344 --> 00:13:47,938
but all of his tests
have come up negative.

210
00:13:48,984 --> 00:13:50,317
Isn't aphasia

211
00:13:50,354 --> 00:13:51,413
typically associated

212
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,256
with some kind
of cranial trauma?

213
00:13:53,294 --> 00:13:55,492
Yes. It can occur
as a result of a stroke

214
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:56,695
or a blow to the head

215
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,730
but there's no evidence
of that here.

216
00:13:58,774 --> 00:14:00,038
Did you check
the medical library

217
00:14:00,077 --> 00:14:01,045
for any precedents?

218
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,247
And rechecked...
nothing, so far.

219
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,722
You have any theories?

220
00:14:05,757 --> 00:14:07,226
Not yet.

221
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:09,027
Find one.

222
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:11,502
Major Kira, get ahold of
the Chief's personal duty log.

223
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:12,837
I want to know where he's been

224
00:14:12,908 --> 00:14:14,776
and what he's done
for the past 52 hours.

225
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,441
I've already examined it,
Commander.

226
00:14:16,483 --> 00:14:17,975
He's been
all over this station.

227
00:14:18,021 --> 00:14:21,359
Retrace his steps
and see what you come up with.

228
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:25,360
Dax, you will temporarily assume
Mr. O'Brien's duties.

229
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:27,034
Yes, uh... um...

230
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,707
Is there a problem, Lieutenant?

231
00:14:29,748 --> 00:14:32,380
Lieutenant?

232
00:14:32,422 --> 00:14:35,395
I'm sorry, Benjamin.

233
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:38,733
I'm unable to...

234
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:42,404
foolish assembled regal...

235
00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:44,440
control weather.

236
00:14:54,942 --> 00:14:57,277
Spontaneous development
of aphasia

237
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:58,943
is virtually impossible.

238
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:02,756
Yet we saw Lieutenant Dax
become aphasiac before our eyes.

239
00:15:02,794 --> 00:15:05,358
This told me we were
dealing with a disease

240
00:15:05,401 --> 00:15:07,895
which only mimics aphasia,
so I ran a full

241
00:15:08,006 --> 00:15:10,443
neural synaptic comparison
between Dax and O'Brien

242
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:13,247
and I found this in the
temporal lobes of both patients.

243
00:15:13,286 --> 00:15:14,414
A virus.

244
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,754
It imposes itself

245
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:17,922
within the established
synaptic pathways

246
00:15:17,963 --> 00:15:19,660
and then randomly
reroutes them.

247
00:15:19,702 --> 00:15:22,436
For example, when I look at this

248
00:15:22,475 --> 00:15:24,776
a process occurs within my brain

249
00:15:24,814 --> 00:15:27,616
which connects the stimulus
to the word "tricorder."

250
00:15:27,654 --> 00:15:29,625
This virus
disrupts that process.

251
00:15:29,659 --> 00:15:31,630
I'd see a tricorder

252
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,934
but I'd say something
ridiculous, like "window."

253
00:15:34,971 --> 00:15:36,133
Exactly.

254
00:15:36,174 --> 00:15:38,543
Doctor, I think
you should get over here.

255
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,140
Night the flow trade again.

256
00:15:40,183 --> 00:15:41,277
You lost pile luck.

257
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,949
Away tunnel back the garden.

258
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,357
Doctor, I want this station

259
00:15:44,394 --> 00:15:46,695
put under emergency
quarantine immediately.

260
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:48,464
Yes, sir.

261
00:15:54,351 --> 00:15:55,513
Dabo!

262
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:07,573
Quark,
what is going on here?

263
00:16:07,616 --> 00:16:09,587
What does it look like?

264
00:16:09,621 --> 00:16:11,922
It looks like
business as usual

265
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,259
but that's impossible

266
00:16:13,297 --> 00:16:15,268
because all shops
and businesses

267
00:16:15,302 --> 00:16:17,603
have been closed
until further notice.

268
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,772
Except, of course, for
essential station operations.

269
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,579
For which this place
hardly qualifies.

270
00:16:22,619 --> 00:16:24,111
I don't think they'd agree.

271
00:16:24,156 --> 00:16:27,027
This quarantine has everybody
on edge, Constable.

272
00:16:27,063 --> 00:16:30,401
Would you deprive them
of a little harmless diversion?

273
00:16:33,043 --> 00:16:37,714
They'd be safer
in their quarters.

274
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:41,891
Quark, this Kohlian stew...
magnificent.

275
00:16:41,932 --> 00:16:46,603
Fortunately, my assistant, Rom,
was able to fix the replicators.

276
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:52,687
Yes, very fortunate.

277
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,599
Jake...

278
00:17:10,634 --> 00:17:13,266
I expected you
home an hour ago.

279
00:17:13,307 --> 00:17:15,038
Sorry. I was at Nog's.

280
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:16,946
Dad, about this quarantine...

281
00:17:16,983 --> 00:17:19,284
it's going
to be okay, isn't it?

282
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:21,086
It's just a precaution,
nothing more.

283
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:23,460
I wish I shared your
confidence, Commander.

284
00:17:23,498 --> 00:17:25,092
Go straight home, son.

285
00:17:25,168 --> 00:17:27,105
I'll see you at dinner.

286
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:29,076
Captain Jaheel, all visitors

287
00:17:29,112 --> 00:17:31,106
have been confined
to their ships.

288
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,120
Believe me, there is
no place I'd rather be.

289
00:17:33,187 --> 00:17:34,850
Then what
are you doing here?

290
00:17:34,892 --> 00:17:37,022
Commander, I officially
request permission

291
00:17:37,064 --> 00:17:38,226
to leave this station.

292
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:39,235
Request denied.

293
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:40,397
But none of my crew

294
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:42,376
has been affected
by this virus of yours.

295
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,313
And, unless I depart at once

296
00:17:44,348 --> 00:17:46,410
my whole cargo will be ruined.

297
00:17:46,453 --> 00:17:51,159
Captain, I suggest
you return to your ship now.

298
00:17:51,231 --> 00:17:56,437
Please. I don't want
to get sick.

299
00:17:56,477 --> 00:18:00,943
I'm sorry, but until we can
find a cure for this... thing

300
00:18:00,987 --> 00:18:02,890
no one's going anywhere.

301
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:32,354
Computer, let's start with
one Ferengi starduster, please.

302
00:18:32,396 --> 00:18:34,059
Extra strong.

303
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,218
Perfect.

304
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:49,233
Uh...

305
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,902
I thought the front wheels
were sticking a bit.

306
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:53,538
Unauthorized access

307
00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:56,110
to crew quarters
is a crime, Quark.

308
00:18:56,153 --> 00:18:59,559
You could have just asked
to use the replicators.

309
00:18:59,595 --> 00:19:04,163
There's an old Ferengi saying...
"Never ask when you can take."

310
00:19:04,206 --> 00:19:06,940
Uh, how did you figure it out?

311
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,147
You claimed Rom
fixed your replicators.

312
00:19:10,187 --> 00:19:12,055
- So?
- Rom's an idiot.

313
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:14,724
He couldn't fix a straw
if it was bent.

314
00:19:14,764 --> 00:19:16,758
You're right.

315
00:19:16,802 --> 00:19:17,998
Rom is an idiot.

316
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:21,502
Remind me to get rid
of him tomorrow.

317
00:19:23,853 --> 00:19:26,553
Based on the levels of the virus
found in the patients' blood

318
00:19:26,593 --> 00:19:28,723
I believe it's being
absorbed through ingestion.

319
00:19:28,765 --> 00:19:30,132
You're saying
it's in our food?

320
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:31,262
Well, that's not possible.

321
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:33,502
All the food on this station
is replicated

322
00:19:33,543 --> 00:19:35,605
and all the replicators
use biofilters.

323
00:19:35,648 --> 00:19:37,846
They automatically
screen out contaminants

324
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:39,186
including viruses.

325
00:19:39,223 --> 00:19:41,160
Major, I've analyzed
samples from replicators

326
00:19:41,194 --> 00:19:42,493
all over the station.

327
00:19:42,531 --> 00:19:44,832
Food on the command level
is contaminated.

328
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:47,170
But all of us here have
eaten from those replicators.

329
00:19:47,209 --> 00:19:48,838
How come we're not aphasic?

330
00:19:48,879 --> 00:19:50,508
This virus
is highly adaptable.

331
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,849
Its incubation period

332
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:53,948
seems to vary
within each individual.

333
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,860
According to O'Brien's duty log

334
00:19:55,896 --> 00:19:58,460
the last thing he did
before becoming aphasic

335
00:19:58,503 --> 00:20:00,196
was fix
the command level replicators.

336
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:03,530
Get a repair crew over there
to inspect the site.

337
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:05,200
Let's shut down
those replicators.

338
00:20:05,241 --> 00:20:07,371
Maybe we'll be able
to limit further contamination.

339
00:20:07,413 --> 00:20:09,042
I'm afraid that's
not going to do it, sir.

340
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,054
I've been getting
aphasic patients

341
00:20:11,088 --> 00:20:12,717
from all over the station.

342
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:14,058
How is that possible?

343
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:15,428
You can thank Quark.

344
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:16,991
I caught him
using a replicator

345
00:20:17,036 --> 00:20:18,801
in one of the vacant
crew quarters.

346
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,243
He was producing
his entire menu out of there.

347
00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:25,886
If this virus is present

348
00:20:25,957 --> 00:20:29,762
within a large enough segment
of the population

349
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,998
it could mean...

350
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:34,100
What is it,
Doctor?

351
00:20:34,143 --> 00:20:38,711
I just took an air sample.

352
00:20:38,755 --> 00:20:40,851
The virus...

353
00:20:40,893 --> 00:20:42,796
It's mutated
into an airborne variety.

354
00:20:42,832 --> 00:20:44,392
Which means?

355
00:20:44,435 --> 00:20:48,537
Which means the whole station
is infected.

356
00:20:57,166 --> 00:21:00,698
Station Log, Stardate 46423.7.

357
00:21:00,741 --> 00:21:03,178
Nearly 60% of DS9's population

358
00:21:03,213 --> 00:21:05,184
has now contracted
the aphasia virus.

359
00:21:05,218 --> 00:21:07,587
We've initiated standard
quarantine procedures

360
00:21:07,624 --> 00:21:09,424
and are advising
all incoming ships

361
00:21:09,462 --> 00:21:12,458
to maintain their distance
from the station

362
00:21:12,502 --> 00:21:14,028
until further notice.

363
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:36,384
I found it in the replicator's
pattern generator.

364
00:21:36,426 --> 00:21:39,160
O'Brien must have accidentally
triggered it

365
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:41,102
when he repaired the system.

366
00:21:41,137 --> 00:21:42,937
According to Bashir,
it introduced

367
00:21:42,976 --> 00:21:44,707
an anomalous programming
sequence

368
00:21:44,746 --> 00:21:46,649
into the materialization
subroutine.

369
00:21:46,684 --> 00:21:48,210
In effect, it built the virus

370
00:21:48,255 --> 00:21:49,986
directly into
the replicated food

371
00:21:50,025 --> 00:21:51,187
at a molecular level.

372
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:53,996
So what we have here
is sabotage.

373
00:21:54,035 --> 00:21:55,129
Cardassian sabotage.

374
00:21:55,171 --> 00:21:56,139
How can you be sure?

375
00:21:56,173 --> 00:21:58,702
Has a diboridium core
for a power source.

376
00:21:58,747 --> 00:22:00,615
That is Cardassian
technology.

377
00:22:00,651 --> 00:22:02,679
Bashir to Sisko.

378
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:04,351
Sisko here.

379
00:22:04,394 --> 00:22:07,265
Commander, I think you'd better
get down here to the infirmary

380
00:22:07,301 --> 00:22:08,770
as soon as possible.

381
00:22:08,804 --> 00:22:10,137
On my way.

382
00:22:15,286 --> 00:22:17,757
You wanted to see me, Doctor?

383
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,161
Jake?

384
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,302
Left... become better...

385
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:29,377
control... entire hope.

386
00:22:31,491 --> 00:22:33,587
We've converted
some empty crew quarters

387
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,598
into a hospital ward.

388
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:35,829
He'll be well looked after.

389
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:37,737
I'll take him there myself.

390
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,072
Come on, Jake.

391
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,944
You're going to be all right.

392
00:22:40,981 --> 00:22:43,681
Commander, when
you've got a moment

393
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:46,558
I've found something
I'd like to show you.

394
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:53,476
It'll be all right.
Just lay back.

395
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,146
I know, but just
lay back and relax.

396
00:22:59,158 --> 00:23:02,063
Food... dabo... drinks...

397
00:23:02,098 --> 00:23:05,732
money... hand... mine... give!

398
00:23:05,773 --> 00:23:07,573
Well, Quark, I see even you

399
00:23:07,611 --> 00:23:10,082
couldn't weasel your
way clear of this one.

400
00:23:10,117 --> 00:23:12,919
You underestimate the Ferengi
immune system, Commander.

401
00:23:12,957 --> 00:23:15,521
I'm merely here visiting
my less fortunate customers

402
00:23:15,564 --> 00:23:17,694
to make sure they're
not faking the illness

403
00:23:17,736 --> 00:23:19,103
to avoid paying their bills.

404
00:23:19,206 --> 00:23:21,074
No one could
be that devious.

405
00:23:21,111 --> 00:23:22,740
I am.

406
00:23:22,781 --> 00:23:25,845
You... gold... owe... me!

407
00:23:29,664 --> 00:23:33,127
I... now... give!

408
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,607
Up.

409
00:23:36,447 --> 00:23:39,181
We're doing
everything possible.

410
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,998
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

411
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:54,282
The virus is synthetic,
Commander.

412
00:23:54,323 --> 00:23:56,294
Its nucleotide sequence
is too perfect.

413
00:23:56,328 --> 00:23:57,558
It's clearly not natural.

414
00:23:57,598 --> 00:23:59,033
You're saying the Cardassians

415
00:23:59,068 --> 00:24:00,765
genetically engineered
this thing?

416
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:02,536
Well, that's what
I thought at first

417
00:24:02,577 --> 00:24:04,946
but I've studied Cardassian
genetic engineering.

418
00:24:04,982 --> 00:24:06,417
They always
build distinctive

419
00:24:06,452 --> 00:24:08,115
monoclonial links
into their DNA.

420
00:24:08,157 --> 00:24:09,922
This virus has none
of those features.

421
00:24:09,961 --> 00:24:11,157
All right,
then who made it?

422
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,824
Well, that's what
I wanted to find out.

423
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,602
So I referenced all known
DNA construction techniques

424
00:24:15,641 --> 00:24:17,076
in the Federation records

425
00:24:17,111 --> 00:24:19,173
and this protein
series was the key.

426
00:24:19,216 --> 00:24:20,184
It indicates...

427
00:24:20,252 --> 00:24:22,746
Doctor!
Who created this virus?

428
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:23,781
The Bajorans, sir.

429
00:24:23,827 --> 00:24:26,094
I believe it must have
been a terrorist plot

430
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:28,799
to sabotage the Cardassians
while they were here.

431
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,848
The energy decay
of the power core

432
00:24:35,889 --> 00:24:39,854
indicates it dates back
to the building of the station.

433
00:24:39,899 --> 00:24:42,063
That's 18 years ago.

434
00:24:42,104 --> 00:24:43,904
I suppose
the Bajoran underground

435
00:24:43,943 --> 00:24:46,973
could have smuggled it aboard
during construction...

436
00:24:47,016 --> 00:24:49,580
before I took over
as Head of Security.

437
00:24:49,623 --> 00:24:52,255
But why would the underground
go to all the trouble

438
00:24:52,295 --> 00:24:53,764
of planting a booby trap
and not set it off?

439
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:55,268
Maybe they forgot.

440
00:24:55,302 --> 00:24:57,866
No. More likely,
they were captured

441
00:24:57,909 --> 00:24:59,847
or killed before
they could release it.

442
00:24:59,847 --> 00:25:00,405
Or killed before
they could release it.

443
00:25:00,449 --> 00:25:03,719
We need to find out
who created this virus.

444
00:25:03,756 --> 00:25:05,225
You're our best hope.

445
00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:09,064
18 years is a long time.

446
00:25:09,103 --> 00:25:10,231
Besides, even if she

447
00:25:10,339 --> 00:25:13,643
finds who did this, that's
no guarantee they can help us.

448
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,981
We just have to hope
they remember the antidote.

449
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:18,753
That's assuming they ever
bothered to create one.

450
00:25:26,945 --> 00:25:28,813
It had to be someone
in the underground

451
00:25:28,849 --> 00:25:30,478
familiar
with genetic engineering.

452
00:25:30,521 --> 00:25:32,013
18 years ago?

453
00:25:32,058 --> 00:25:33,152
Sounds like something

454
00:25:33,193 --> 00:25:34,924
Dekon Elig
might have thought up.

455
00:25:34,964 --> 00:25:35,989
How can I find him?

456
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:38,801
The last I heard
he was in a Cardassian prison.

457
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,002
Where was he being held?

458
00:25:40,043 --> 00:25:42,811
The Velos VII Internment Camp

459
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:45,321
but that was nine years ago.

460
00:25:45,423 --> 00:25:49,057
And you have no idea
where he is now?

461
00:25:49,099 --> 00:25:52,335
Think, Galis.
This is important.

462
00:25:52,372 --> 00:25:57,282
I'm sorry, Kira,
but it was all so long ago.

463
00:26:02,564 --> 00:26:03,863
What is it, Jake?

464
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,871
Roll linger when life...

465
00:26:05,905 --> 00:26:07,534
roll linger when...

466
00:26:07,576 --> 00:26:08,909
What?

467
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:19,027
Other support, strong courage...

468
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,917
He's running a high fever.

469
00:26:26,956 --> 00:26:28,927
Open way long.

470
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,623
Open way.

471
00:26:32,302 --> 00:26:35,070
Doctor, we have
an emergency in crew quarters.

472
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:50,912
How is he, Doctor?

473
00:26:50,946 --> 00:26:52,415
Not good, I'm afraid.

474
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:55,423
The virus has attacked
his autonomic nervous system.

475
00:26:55,457 --> 00:26:56,926
Can he be stabilized?

476
00:26:56,961 --> 00:26:59,057
He hasn't responded
to neural stimulation.

477
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,094
I've given him 30cc's
of corophizine

478
00:27:01,137 --> 00:27:02,697
to avoid secondary infection

479
00:27:02,742 --> 00:27:05,476
but so far, I've been unable
to lower his fever.

480
00:27:05,515 --> 00:27:07,109
What are his chances?

481
00:27:07,152 --> 00:27:12,392
Unless I find some way
to counteract the virus

482
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:14,226
he'll be dead in 12 hours.

483
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:16,923
Have you made any progress?

484
00:27:16,966 --> 00:27:18,435
No.

485
00:27:18,469 --> 00:27:21,101
I've tried
base pair destabilizers

486
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:24,944
sequential disruption...
nothing seems to affect it.

487
00:27:24,985 --> 00:27:28,117
Sir, I've got seven
other aphasic patients

488
00:27:28,225 --> 00:27:31,631
displaying the same symptoms
as O'Brien here

489
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:34,799
and I'm afraid
this is only the beginning.

490
00:27:34,842 --> 00:27:36,870
Keep searching, Doctor.

491
00:27:36,913 --> 00:27:38,542
I hope Major Kira finds

492
00:27:38,584 --> 00:27:41,888
whoever's responsible
for creating this virus.

493
00:27:41,925 --> 00:27:44,489
I'd like to meet
that person myself.

494
00:27:44,531 --> 00:27:46,764
This virus
is a work of genius.

495
00:27:46,803 --> 00:27:49,206
I'll try to
arrange it for you.

496
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:02,603
Link established with
the Bajoran Archival Records.

497
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:05,478
Locate files on Velos VII
Internment Camp.

498
00:28:05,515 --> 00:28:06,609
Ready.

499
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:09,020
Do you show a record
of an inmate named Dekon Elig?

500
00:28:09,056 --> 00:28:10,650
Affirmative.

501
00:28:10,694 --> 00:28:12,824
Biographical data.

502
00:28:12,866 --> 00:28:14,894
Dekon Elig, geneticist.

503
00:28:14,938 --> 00:28:17,000
Former member
of the Higa Metar sect

504
00:28:17,043 --> 00:28:18,706
of the Bajoran underground.

505
00:28:18,747 --> 00:28:22,620
Killed while attempting escape,
Stardate 39355.

506
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:25,185
Certificate of Death on file.

507
00:28:25,262 --> 00:28:28,360
No need to ask
how you're doing.

508
00:28:28,403 --> 00:28:29,929
Chasing after ghosts.

509
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:31,774
You have 12 hours
to catch one.

510
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:33,474
And then?

511
00:28:33,516 --> 00:28:35,179
People start dying.

512
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,667
Computer...

513
00:28:45,077 --> 00:28:47,777
display Dekon Elig's
Certificate of Death.

514
00:28:49,621 --> 00:28:51,888
Identify signature of witness.

515
00:28:51,926 --> 00:28:55,264
Certificate of Death
was witnessed by Surmak Ren

516
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:58,136
Bajoran medical assistant.

517
00:28:58,174 --> 00:29:01,842
Show me biographical data
on Surmak Ren.

518
00:29:01,883 --> 00:29:03,182
Dr. Surmak Ren.

519
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,954
Former member
of the Higa Metar sect

520
00:29:05,993 --> 00:29:07,758
of the Bajoran underground.

521
00:29:07,797 --> 00:29:09,995
Repatriated to Bajor
upon closing

522
00:29:10,037 --> 00:29:14,845
of the Velos VII Internment
Camp, Stardate 46302.

523
00:29:14,881 --> 00:29:16,749
Current status unknown.

524
00:29:29,316 --> 00:29:30,649
Dabo.

525
00:29:37,135 --> 00:29:38,627
Any luck?

526
00:29:38,672 --> 00:29:42,238
I haven't won a spin in hours.

527
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,878
Uh, care to place
a friendly wager?

528
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:48,051
If it's your reputation
you're thinking about

529
00:29:48,094 --> 00:29:49,928
no one need ever know.

530
00:29:49,965 --> 00:29:53,907
It has nothing to do
with my reputation.

531
00:29:55,645 --> 00:29:58,675
The truth is, I never...

532
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,554
learned the game.

533
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,823
You mean, you've sat here
for all these years

534
00:30:02,862 --> 00:30:04,765
and you don't even
know how to gamble?

535
00:30:04,801 --> 00:30:06,965
That's correct.

536
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:09,604
No wonder you
always look so bored.

537
00:30:09,646 --> 00:30:13,109
The rules are quite
simple, actually.

538
00:30:13,154 --> 00:30:15,250
I'd be happy to
show them to you.

539
00:30:15,293 --> 00:30:17,526
Some other time, perhaps.

540
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,194
Sisko needs me in Ops.

541
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:21,604
And, since
the entire security force

542
00:30:21,641 --> 00:30:23,805
has been stricken
with aphasia

543
00:30:23,847 --> 00:30:26,820
the Promenade is in
a very vulnerable position.

544
00:30:26,854 --> 00:30:29,257
How unfortunate.

545
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:34,361
Consider it a warning, Quark.

546
00:30:34,405 --> 00:30:37,675
Because I'm holding you
personally responsible

547
00:30:37,713 --> 00:30:40,983
if anything turns up missing.

548
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:43,390
Is that understood?

549
00:30:43,426 --> 00:30:44,918
Perfectly.

550
00:30:44,963 --> 00:30:46,296
Hmm.

551
00:30:54,754 --> 00:30:56,018
Dabo.

552
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,128
Computer,
analyze test sample 37 delta.

553
00:31:01,169 --> 00:31:03,606
Detail effects
on viral containment.

554
00:31:03,641 --> 00:31:05,737
Working. Analysis complete.

555
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,842
Sample 37 delta ineffective.

556
00:31:07,885 --> 00:31:11,850
Viral protein sheath
is unaffected.

557
00:31:11,895 --> 00:31:14,800
Nucleotide sequence
remains intact.

558
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,281
Computer, replay morning.

559
00:31:20,315 --> 00:31:21,614
Command unclear.

560
00:31:21,652 --> 00:31:23,019
Please repeat.

561
00:31:26,764 --> 00:31:30,500
Glass lunch judge a bin
to let it.

562
00:31:30,606 --> 00:31:32,235
Command unclear.

563
00:31:32,277 --> 00:31:33,769
Please repeat.

564
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:50,278
Computer, establish a link
with the Bajoran Medical Index

565
00:31:50,321 --> 00:31:53,887
for the, uh,
Northwestern District.

566
00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:55,558
Link established.

567
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:58,903
Access all information
on Dr. Surmak Ren.

568
00:31:58,941 --> 00:32:01,846
There are no records
matching that name.

569
00:32:01,881 --> 00:32:04,683
Try the Northeastern District...
same search.

570
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:07,193
Dr. Surmak Ren,
currently serving

571
00:32:07,227 --> 00:32:11,066
as Chief Administrator
of the Ilvian Medical Complex.

572
00:32:11,104 --> 00:32:14,476
Computer, open a channel
to the Ilvian Medical Complex

573
00:32:14,512 --> 00:32:17,508
Administrator's office.

574
00:32:17,552 --> 00:32:20,525
This is Dr. Surmak.
And you are?

575
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,119
Major Kira Nerys

576
00:32:22,163 --> 00:32:24,327
Bajoran liaison to Deep Space 9.

577
00:32:24,368 --> 00:32:27,068
Ah, yes, the old Cardassian
mining station.

578
00:32:27,108 --> 00:32:28,577
How can I help you?

579
00:32:28,612 --> 00:32:29,911
It depends.

580
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,247
On what?

581
00:32:31,285 --> 00:32:33,917
On whether or not
you helped Dekon Elig

582
00:32:33,958 --> 00:32:36,760
plant an aphasia virus here
18 years ago.

583
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,863
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

584
00:32:43,314 --> 00:32:45,785
Look, Sisko, I'm a security
officer... a good one...

585
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,483
but that doesn't
make me qualified

586
00:32:47,524 --> 00:32:49,289
to help you run
station operations.

587
00:32:49,328 --> 00:32:51,196
You're probably right,
Constable.

588
00:32:51,233 --> 00:32:53,636
But, as you can see,
you're all I've got.

589
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:55,643
Commander...

590
00:32:55,677 --> 00:32:58,809
Commander, I think
I found our scientist.

591
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,321
Does he have an antidote?

592
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:01,824
I don't know.
He broke the connection

593
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:03,260
the minute
I mentioned the virus.

594
00:33:03,295 --> 00:33:05,698
Major, you mind telling me
where you're going?

595
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:09,072
To continue my conversation
with Dr. Surmak, in person.

596
00:33:09,109 --> 00:33:11,809
Major, I can't allow you
to break quarantine.

597
00:33:11,849 --> 00:33:13,409
We can't risk
spreading the virus to Bajor.

598
00:33:13,453 --> 00:33:14,752
I am well aware
of that, Commander.

599
00:33:14,789 --> 00:33:16,258
As a matter of fact

600
00:33:16,293 --> 00:33:18,628
I don't intend
to step foot on the planet.

601
00:33:18,698 --> 00:33:21,637
Better let her go, Sisko.

602
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,440
She's all we've got.

603
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,367
Let's just hope
there's someone left

604
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,175
to greet her when she returns.

605
00:33:53,582 --> 00:33:54,881
Jake.

606
00:33:56,656 --> 00:33:58,125
How's it going?

607
00:34:11,525 --> 00:34:13,251
I've missed you.

608
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:16,621
I know things don't look
too good right now

609
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:19,291
but they'll get better.

610
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:22,363
You have to believe that

611
00:34:22,406 --> 00:34:26,279
because I'm not going
to lose you, Jake.

612
00:34:26,316 --> 00:34:28,412
You hear me?

613
00:34:28,455 --> 00:34:30,790
I'm not going to lose you.

614
00:34:44,059 --> 00:34:46,087
You better take a look at this.

615
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,762
We have activity
on Docking Port 5.

616
00:34:48,803 --> 00:34:51,104
I think a ship
is about to depart.

617
00:34:51,143 --> 00:34:52,612
Docking Port 5?

618
00:34:52,646 --> 00:34:54,115
That's Jaheel's ship.

619
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,642
Put him on screen.

620
00:34:59,262 --> 00:35:00,595
Captain, your ship

621
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:03,161
has not been cleared
for departure.

622
00:35:03,237 --> 00:35:04,365
The mooring clamps are locked

623
00:35:04,407 --> 00:35:05,842
and I don't intend
to release them.

624
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,614
I suggest you change your mind.

625
00:35:09,653 --> 00:35:12,022
I'm taking aft thrusters
to one half.

626
00:35:15,066 --> 00:35:16,866
Captain, cut your engines

627
00:35:16,904 --> 00:35:19,137
before you rip
your ship apart.

628
00:35:19,176 --> 00:35:21,147
He's not reducing power.

629
00:35:21,181 --> 00:35:24,883
Jaheel, I'm ordering
you to stand down.

630
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:27,326
Your orders
are no concern of mine.

631
00:35:27,362 --> 00:35:30,096
My entire crew has been
confined to your hospital.

632
00:35:30,135 --> 00:35:33,336
I must leave now,
while I can still function.

633
00:35:33,377 --> 00:35:35,348
Look, I understand
that you're frightened

634
00:35:35,381 --> 00:35:37,249
but, believe me,
you're better off here.

635
00:35:37,319 --> 00:35:39,050
You don't want
to be out there alone

636
00:35:39,091 --> 00:35:40,253
and get hit by the virus.

637
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,698
Don't worry about me,
I'm fine.

638
00:35:43,735 --> 00:35:46,206
And I plan to stay that way.

639
00:35:46,241 --> 00:35:47,801
And if you think you're go...

640
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,178
We'll have to
retract the clamps.

641
00:35:52,222 --> 00:35:54,284
Once he's clear
of the station

642
00:35:54,394 --> 00:35:57,026
we can grab him
with a tractor beam.

643
00:36:02,012 --> 00:36:03,481
Damn.

644
00:36:03,516 --> 00:36:04,985
What's wrong?

645
00:36:05,019 --> 00:36:07,013
There's too much stress
on the mooring clamps.

646
00:36:07,058 --> 00:36:08,618
They're not retracting.

647
00:36:14,241 --> 00:36:16,610
His aft isolation
plate buckled.

648
00:36:16,647 --> 00:36:19,084
His main power core's
been ruptured.

649
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,284
If the internal
fuel cells collapse

650
00:36:21,392 --> 00:36:23,157
the whole ship will explode.

651
00:36:23,196 --> 00:36:25,794
And take half
the docking ring with it.

652
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:38,023
Computer, isolate a com line

653
00:36:38,065 --> 00:36:41,528
to the Ilvian Medical Complex
Administrator's office.

654
00:36:41,573 --> 00:36:43,202
Line isolated.

655
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:45,215
Scan office for life-forms.

656
00:36:45,249 --> 00:36:47,720
One life-form present.

657
00:36:47,755 --> 00:36:51,423
Lock on
and stand by to transport.

658
00:36:52,399 --> 00:36:54,062
This is Dr. Surmak.

659
00:36:54,103 --> 00:36:55,937
Hello again, Doctor.

660
00:36:55,974 --> 00:36:57,911
Just checking
to see you're in your office.

661
00:36:57,946 --> 00:36:59,940
I have nothing to say to...

662
00:37:07,837 --> 00:37:09,637
Hello again, Doctor.

663
00:37:09,674 --> 00:37:11,143
This is outrageous.

664
00:37:11,177 --> 00:37:12,771
I demand you return me

665
00:37:12,815 --> 00:37:14,615
to my office immediately.

666
00:37:14,652 --> 00:37:15,848
Relax, Doctor.

667
00:37:15,889 --> 00:37:17,483
You won't be gone long.

668
00:37:22,705 --> 00:37:24,608
Try to reestablish
visual contact

669
00:37:24,643 --> 00:37:25,805
with Jaheel's ship.

670
00:37:27,316 --> 00:37:28,876
No response.

671
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,389
His com lines are down.

672
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:33,361
Bypass communications
through a secondary grid.

673
00:37:33,397 --> 00:37:36,063
See if you can switch
to external pickups.

674
00:37:36,104 --> 00:37:37,437
Got it.

675
00:37:39,846 --> 00:37:43,309
His fire control systems
don't appear to be working.

676
00:37:43,354 --> 00:37:45,416
We have about 15 minutes

677
00:37:45,526 --> 00:37:48,294
before the fuel cells collapse.

678
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:51,306
I hope you feel better
than you look.

679
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,208
Must be that damn virus.

680
00:37:53,245 --> 00:37:54,714
This is Sisko.

681
00:37:54,748 --> 00:37:57,448
Any station personnel
who can understand

682
00:37:57,522 --> 00:38:00,188
what I'm saying, come
to Ops immediately.

683
00:38:00,229 --> 00:38:01,698
We need help up here.

684
00:38:01,732 --> 00:38:04,226
We have to get that ship
away from the station.

685
00:38:04,272 --> 00:38:06,243
Why don't we explode
the mooring clamps?

686
00:38:06,276 --> 00:38:09,113
The blast should push the ship
away from the docking ring.

687
00:38:09,149 --> 00:38:13,216
We'll have to get down there
and blow it manually.

688
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,889
I'll do it.

689
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:17,401
All right.

690
00:38:17,436 --> 00:38:19,407
You can cross barrels.

691
00:38:19,441 --> 00:38:21,605
All job appalled.

692
00:38:21,647 --> 00:38:24,176
What was that?

693
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,452
Bread...

694
00:38:26,558 --> 00:38:28,152
the arrive...

695
00:38:28,195 --> 00:38:30,632
seen earlier.

696
00:38:30,668 --> 00:38:34,735
Oh, I see.

697
00:38:43,532 --> 00:38:45,092
Major, this is kidnapping.

698
00:38:45,136 --> 00:38:48,075
Turn this ship around or,
I swear, you will spend

699
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:50,674
the rest of your life
in Kran-Tobol Prison.

700
00:38:50,716 --> 00:38:53,382
Fine. But first,
we need your help.

701
00:38:53,422 --> 00:38:56,520
The aphasia virus is spreading
through the station.

702
00:38:56,564 --> 00:38:58,158
Why come to me?

703
00:38:58,201 --> 00:39:00,263
You helped create the virus,
didn't you?

704
00:39:00,306 --> 00:39:02,243
No, I had practically
nothing to do with it.

705
00:39:02,277 --> 00:39:04,248
Dekon Elig created the virus.

706
00:39:04,281 --> 00:39:06,411
I was merely
his medical assistant.

707
00:39:06,453 --> 00:39:08,481
That seems
like a lifetime ago now.

708
00:39:08,525 --> 00:39:11,019
I was only in the underground
for six months

709
00:39:11,065 --> 00:39:12,694
before we were captured.

710
00:39:12,735 --> 00:39:14,706
I am not responsible for this.

711
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,904
I am not looking to place blame!

712
00:39:16,945 --> 00:39:18,710
All I want is the antidote.

713
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,983
I don't know of any antidote.

714
00:39:21,022 --> 00:39:23,824
If Dekon created one,
he never told me.

715
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,331
Listen, Surmak.

716
00:39:25,366 --> 00:39:28,168
I have a station
full of dying people

717
00:39:28,206 --> 00:39:30,109
and you are
the closest thing there is

718
00:39:30,144 --> 00:39:31,545
to an expert on this virus.

719
00:39:31,614 --> 00:39:33,140
I sympathize, Major

720
00:39:33,185 --> 00:39:35,554
but I don't think
I can help you.

721
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,560
All right.

722
00:39:37,628 --> 00:39:41,501
Then how about helping yourself?

723
00:39:41,537 --> 00:39:43,097
Meaning what?

724
00:39:43,142 --> 00:39:45,170
Meaning...

725
00:39:45,214 --> 00:39:48,985
I've been infected
with your virus, Doctor

726
00:39:49,022 --> 00:39:53,362
so now you're infected, too.

727
00:39:58,545 --> 00:40:01,313
To anyone who can hear me,
this is Odo.

728
00:40:01,352 --> 00:40:02,616
Sisko's infected.

729
00:40:02,688 --> 00:40:05,354
I could really use
some help here in Ops.

730
00:40:05,395 --> 00:40:08,197
Do I detect a note
of panic in your voice?

731
00:40:08,235 --> 00:40:09,761
Quark.

732
00:40:09,805 --> 00:40:13,644
Am I to believe that you're
volunteering to help?

733
00:40:13,681 --> 00:40:16,210
Who said anything
about volunteering?

734
00:40:16,254 --> 00:40:18,555
We can haggle over price later.

735
00:40:18,593 --> 00:40:20,358
Now, um...

736
00:40:20,398 --> 00:40:23,530
how may I be of use?

737
00:40:23,572 --> 00:40:25,770
I need to get
to Docking Port 5 now.

738
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:28,247
That ship's going to explode
in five minutes.

739
00:40:28,283 --> 00:40:30,048
I'll beam you over.

740
00:40:30,087 --> 00:40:31,215
You?

741
00:40:31,257 --> 00:40:32,521
Relax.

742
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,929
I served on a
Ferengi freighter

743
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:37,335
for eight years.

744
00:40:37,372 --> 00:40:38,431
All right.

745
00:40:38,474 --> 00:40:40,809
I must have witnessed
the procedure

746
00:40:40,846 --> 00:40:42,110
hundreds of times.

747
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:43,345
Witnessed?

748
00:40:43,386 --> 00:40:45,950
You mean to say you never
handled the controls yourself?

749
00:40:47,161 --> 00:40:48,494
Energizing.

750
00:41:06,543 --> 00:41:09,573
Kira to Ops.
Approaching Landing Pad 7.

751
00:41:09,618 --> 00:41:12,956
Request clearance
to initiate docking procedure.

752
00:41:12,992 --> 00:41:14,986
Welcome back.
I could use some help up here.

753
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,522
Quark, what are you

754
00:41:16,567 --> 00:41:18,561
doing in Ops?

755
00:41:23,617 --> 00:41:25,485
First thing I need to see

756
00:41:25,522 --> 00:41:28,689
is your doctor's viral
characterization research.

757
00:41:31,771 --> 00:41:33,674
He was beginning to develop
an antidote series.

758
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:34,802
Let's take a look at that.

759
00:41:34,845 --> 00:41:36,975
Listen, Doctor, um

760
00:41:37,016 --> 00:41:38,144
I'll be in Ops.

761
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:40,987
If you need me,
use this string impact.

762
00:41:41,026 --> 00:41:43,259
Lot show red intense.

763
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,334
I think you'd better
sit down, Major.

764
00:42:06,788 --> 00:42:09,157
Dog fellow distance.

765
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:10,856
Yeah, tell me about it.

766
00:42:10,897 --> 00:42:13,300
Odo, you'd better hurry up.

767
00:42:13,337 --> 00:42:15,706
That ship's going to explode
in one minute.

768
00:42:18,883 --> 00:42:21,549
Virum protein sheath.

769
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:23,458
Nucleotide sequence.

770
00:42:23,494 --> 00:42:24,986
Yes.

771
00:42:25,031 --> 00:42:26,500
That's right.

772
00:42:26,535 --> 00:42:28,972
It's an adaptive,
synaptic inhibitor.

773
00:42:29,008 --> 00:42:30,534
Dekon was brilliant.

774
00:42:30,578 --> 00:42:32,549
No doubt of that.

775
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,554
I think we've found

776
00:42:34,587 --> 00:42:36,421
your antidote, Major.

777
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:40,224
40 seconds.

778
00:42:54,001 --> 00:42:55,493
30 seconds. Hurry!

779
00:42:55,538 --> 00:42:57,805
I know, I know.

780
00:43:01,987 --> 00:43:03,981
20 seconds!

781
00:43:09,471 --> 00:43:11,465
Ten seconds!

782
00:43:36,336 --> 00:43:38,603
Odo? Quark to Odo.

783
00:43:38,641 --> 00:43:40,008
You still with us?

784
00:43:40,045 --> 00:43:42,779
Try not to sound
too disappointed.

785
00:43:42,818 --> 00:43:45,791
Now, about that little matter

786
00:43:45,825 --> 00:43:47,659
of my hazard pay...

787
00:43:47,696 --> 00:43:49,131
Why, you...

788
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:55,210
Come on. Come on.

789
00:43:58,956 --> 00:44:02,921
Station Log, Stardate 46425.8.

790
00:44:02,966 --> 00:44:05,028
With the help
of Dr. Bashir's notes

791
00:44:05,071 --> 00:44:08,477
Dr. Surmak was able to find an
antidote for the aphasia virus.

792
00:44:08,513 --> 00:44:11,783
We are continuing to administer
it throughout the station

793
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,654
and things are slowly
returning to normal.

794
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,993
Good to have you back, Chief.

795
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:17,431
Thank you, sir.

796
00:44:17,467 --> 00:44:18,959
Coffee, black.

797
00:44:25,721 --> 00:44:27,350
O'Brien!
