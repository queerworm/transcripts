1
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,553
[muffled shouting]

2
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,430
Look, save your energy.

3
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,516
We'll have you out of there
as soon as possible.

4
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,310
I hope.

5
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:23,982
Try rerouting
the power coupling.

6
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,779
Mr. O'Brien.

7
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,157
See if you can activate
the interlock servos.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,700
Mr. O'Brien.

9
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:37,454
Captain Jaheel, those people
have been stuck in that air lock

10
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,705
for over an hour.

11
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,166
Now, if you can wait
till we get that door opened

12
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,501
I'll be happy to listen
to any problems you might have.

13
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,379
But I've already been waiting two days
for your people to readjust

14
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,631
my ship's antimatter flow converter.

15
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,760
I'm afraid we've gotten a little behind
in our maintenance schedule.

16
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,553
I'm not interested in hearing excuses.

17
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:56,931
I have a shipment of Tamen Sahsheer
waiting to be delivered to Largo V,

18
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:00,101
and I'll need to do better than warp 1
to get there before it spoils.

19
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:04,022
I'll try to get a repair crew
to you by the end of the day.

20
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,523
Now, that's the best I can do.

21
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,318
Your best, Mr. O'Brien,
hardly seems good enough.

22
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,573
[woman]<i> Dax to O'Brien.</i>

23
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,200
O'Brien here.

24
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,493
<i>Can you spare a minute, Chief?</i>

25
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,244
<i>I have a little problem here at the lab.</i>

26
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,123
On my way.

27
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,297
Thanks for coming, Chief.

28
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,174
What are you doing out here?

29
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,428
[loud whining]

30
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,642
Have you checked the EPS converter?

31
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,268
Yes, first thing.

32
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,729
-How about the intensity grid?
-It's fine.

33
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,607
Then it's probably the secondary
phase modulator.

34
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,860
We had trouble with them last week
in the main power core.

35
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,823
That should do it.

36
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:55,865
[noise stops]

37
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,871
Anything else I can do for you?

38
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,669
The navigational computer
hasn't worked reliably for three days.

39
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:10,505
I ask for the star charts
for the Argosian sector--

40
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,799
Glessene sector
comes up instead.

41
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,760
That's when I can coax
this system on line.

42
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,178
[O'Brien] Uh-huh.

43
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,055
Try it now.

44
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,643
Huh! That's more like it.

45
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,905
You look like you
could use some sleep.

46
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,448
Who has time for sleep?

47
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,327
I'd settle for five minutes
peace and quiet.

48
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,792
Chief, I thought you were going
to fix the replicators.

49
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,879
You're absolutely right, sir.

50
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,422
I knew I'd forgotten something.

51
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,341
Can't have the Operations Chief
sitting around daydreaming

52
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,427
when there's work
to be done, can we?

53
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,929
Ho, ho, ho, ho.
I'll get right on it.

54
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,684
"Fix the replicators, Chief."

55
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,728
"My console's off-line, Chief."

56
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,229
[groaning]

57
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,857
I should have transferred
to a cargo drone--

58
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,234
no people, no complaints.

59
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,175
[sighs]

60
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,851
[instrument humming]

61
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,777
Hot coffee-- black, double sweet.

62
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,977
[beeping]

63
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,137
[Odo] Tell me, Quark.

64
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:32,517
Am I mistaken, or is business
a little slow today?

65
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:36,938
{\an8}Slow? It's been almost nonexistent
for the past three days.

66
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,107
{\an8}Mmm. Who knows?

67
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:43,820
{\an8}If things don't improve
you may be forced to close down.

68
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,530
{\an8}Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

69
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:50,701
{\an8}Well, let's just say, without you around
my job would be considerably easier.

70
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,621
{\an8}Without me around,
you'd be forced to find

71
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,541
{\an8}some other poor innocent to persecute.

72
00:06:56,624 --> 00:07:01,003
{\an8}Think about that while you sit here
gloating at my misfortune.

73
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,171
{\an8}Quark!

74
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,549
{\an8}You call this Kohlian stew?

75
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:15,643
{\an8}If your meal isn't satisfactory
I'm sure we could, uh, exchange it

76
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,270
{\an8}for something more to your liking.

77
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:22,275
{\an8}Aren't you the least bit curious
as to how it tastes?

78
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,447
{\an8}[groaning]

79
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,823
{\an8}Now...

80
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,199
you served it.

81
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,617
You're going to eat it.

82
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,870
All right, that's enough.

83
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,205
I said, eat it!

84
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,667
I said...

85
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,794
{\an8}that's enough.

86
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,963
{\an8}Leave him alone.

87
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:52,305
{\an8}Well, another satisfied customer.

88
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,350
It's these replicators.

89
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,020
If I don't get them fixed soon,
they'll destroy my business.

90
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,980
Why not get O'Brien to fix them?

91
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:04,066
He has the replicators on
the command level working perfectly.

92
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,777
I'm on his waiting list.

93
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,822
He assures me he'll get to them
as soon as he can.

94
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,532
Mmm...

95
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,451
No telling when that will be.

96
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,245
The Chief's a very busy man.

97
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,793
Computer...

98
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,379
display a station layout.

99
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:30,760
Highlight locations
of all repaired replicators

100
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,345
on command level.

101
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,596

There you go, sir.

106
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,718
I think you'll find that
more to your liking.

107
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,304
Very much appreciated, Mr. O'Brien.

108
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,430
Don't mention it, sir.

109
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,391
Unfortunately,
there are plenty of replicators

110
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,142
around the station
that still need looking after.

111
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,895
You all right, Chief?

112
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,106
I'm just a bit hot.

113
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,276
The environmental controls
must be acting up again.

114
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,819
Send my regards to Mrs. O'Brien.

115
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,654
Jake tells me she's a wonderful teacher.

116
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,447
Oh, that's nice to hear, sir.

117
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,241
She's flower units about the lad herself.

118
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,784
Excuse me?

119
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:37,827
Sir?

120
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,453
What was that you just said?

121
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:44,166
She's... quite fond of the lad herself.

122
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,168
Oh.

123
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,837
I'm glad to hear it.

124
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,380
Very good, sir.

125
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,973
[man] Ladies.

126
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,600
Hello, Lieutenant.

127
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,228
Oh, I forgot how different it was.

128
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,938
How different what was?

129
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,857
Being female.

130
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,900
I haven't been one for over 80 years.

131
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,861
All this attention.

132
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,696
Imagine it must take
some getting used to.

133
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,448
Actually, I find it quite enjoyable.

134
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,907
Major Kira.

135
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,492
Lieutenant Dax.

136
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,413
I'd be honored to have you
join my little party--

137
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,040
as my guests, of course.

138
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,708
What's all this, Quark?

139
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,044
You cheat your 1,000th customer?

140
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,838
Who says Bajorans
don't have a sense of humor?

141
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:36,302
Actually, uh, we're celebrating the repair
of the bar's replicator system.

142
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,513
Perhaps I could interest you

143
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:43,434
in a nice, double-whipped,
I'danian spice pudding.

144
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,394
Oh, what do you think?

145
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,563
I think I'm due back at Ops

146
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,065
but, uh, go on.

147
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,399
Enjoy yourself.

148
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,996
Chief?

149
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,165
[slurring] How can I help you, Major?

150
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,753
Looks like you're the one
who could use a little help.

151
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,381
Oh, no, I'm fine, really.

152
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,678
I suppose this isn't
a good time to tell you

153
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,139
that number three turbolift
has broken down again.

154
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,229
Joking, Chief.

155
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,899
Major, lark's true pepper.

156
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,901
What?

157
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,115
Let birds go further loose maybe.

158
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:41,909
Shout easy play.

159
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,703
Chief, you're not making any sense.

160
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,914
Round the turbulent quick.

161
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,337
Well, close the reverse harbor.

162
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,428
A-Ankle try sound.

163
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,847

164
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,475
D-Dinner to bug.

165
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,230
Chief, wait.

166
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,065
When?

167
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,233
Chief.

168
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,583

00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,981
Will you pull up Mr. O'Brien's

176
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:54,982
Yes, Doctor.

177

Strike limits flame the dark true salt.

180
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,625
Please, Chief, take a seat.

181
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,418
Way link complete.

182
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,003
Way link!

183
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,799
What's wrong with him?

184
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,260
He appears to suffering
from a form of aphasia.

185
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,637
It's a perceptual dysfunction

186
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,390
in which aural and visual stimuli
are incorrectly processed by the brain.

187
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,518
His actual thinking hasn't been affected

188
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,561
but he's incapable of expressing himself

189
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,605
or understanding others.

190
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,442
Victory strike limits frosted wake.

191
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,446
Simple hesitation!

192
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,907
I'm not sure I follow you, Doctor.

193
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,450
You say Mr. O'Brien is aphasiac

194
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,993
but all of his tests
have come up negative.

195
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:53,457
Isn't aphasia typically associated
with some kind of cranial trauma?

196
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:57,294
Yes. It can occur as a result of a stroke
or a blow to the head.

197
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,837
But there's no evidence of that here.

198
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,382
Did you check the medical library
for any precedents?

199
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:04,468
And rechecked-- nothing, so far.

200
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,761
You have any theories?

201
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,763
Not yet.

202
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,181
Find one.

203
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:12,101
Major Kira, get a hold
of the Chief's personal duty log.

204
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,104
I want to know where he's been
and what he's done for the past 52 hours.

205
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,524
I've already examined it, Commander.
He's been all over this station.

206
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,235
Retrace his steps and see what
you come up with.

207
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:25,072
Dax, you will temporarily assume
Mr. O'Brien's duties.

208
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,032
Yes, uh... Um...

209
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,951
Is there a problem, Lieutenant?

210
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,662
Lieutenant?

211
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,916
I'm sorry, Benjamin.

212
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,793
I'm unable to...

213
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,131
foolish assembled regal...

214
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,383
control weather.

215
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:59,356
Spontaneous development of aphasia
is virtually impossible.

216
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,818
Yet we saw Lieutenant Dax
become aphasiac before our eyes.

217
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,486
This told me we were
dealing with a disease

218
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,155
which only mimics aphasia,

219
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:10,743
so I ran a full neural synaptic comparison
between Dax and O'Brien

220
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,245
and I found this in the temporal lobes
of both patients.

221
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,663
A virus.

222
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,708
It imposes itself
within the established synaptic pathways

223
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,668
and then randomly reroutes them.

224
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,379
For example, when I look at this,

225
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,007
a process occurs within my brain

226
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,551
which connects the stimulus
to the word "tricorder."

227
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,678
This virus disrupts that process.

228
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,097
I'd see a tricorder

229
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,975
but I'd say something ridiculous,
like "window."

230
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,268
Exactly.

231
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,895
Doctor, I think you should get over here.

232
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,939
-Night the flow trade again.
-You lost pile luck.

233
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,024
Away tunnel back the garden.

234
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,943
Doctor, I want this station

235
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,111
put under emergency quarantine
immediately.

236
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,321
Yes, sir.

237
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,745
[conversation and music]

238
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:55,955
[man] Dabo!

239
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,122
[shouting]

240
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,841
Quark, what is going on here?

241
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,385
What does it look like?

242
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,845
It looks like business as usual

243
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,263
but that's impossible

244
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,809
because all shops and businesses
have been closed until further notice.

245
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,853
Except, of course,
for essential station operations.

246
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,439
For which this place hardly qualifies.

247
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,941
I don't think they'd agree.

248
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,986
This quarantine has everybody
on edge, Constable.

249
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,280
Would you deprive them
of a little harmless diversion?

250
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,746
They'd be safer in their quarters.

251
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,792
Quark, this Kohlian stew-- magnificent.

252
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,713
Fortunately, my assistant, Rom,
was able to fix the replicators.

253
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:52,219
Yes... Very fortunate.

254
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,321
[Sisko] Jake...

255
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,115
I expected you home an hour ago.

256
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,908
Sorry. I was at Nog's.

257
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,119
Dad, about this quarantine--

258
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,620
it's going to be OK, isn't it?

259
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,414
It's just a precaution, nothing more.

260
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,583
[Jaheel] I wish I shared your
confidence, Commander.

261
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,085
Go straight home, son.

262
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,795
I'll see you at dinner.

263
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,216
Captain Jaheel, all visitors
have been confined to their ships.

264
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,427
Believe me,
there is no place I'd rather be.

265
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,720
Then what are you doing here?

266
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,599
Commander, I officially request permission
to leave this station.

267
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,725
Request denied.

268
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,436
But none of my crew
has been affected by this virus of yours.

269
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:46,190
And unless I depart at once
my whole cargo will be ruined!

270
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:50,903
Captain, I suggest
you return to your ship now.

271
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:56,033
Please. I don't want to get sick.

272
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:01,080
I'm sorry, but until we can
find a cure for this... thing,

273
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,581
no one's going anywhere.

274
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,563
Computer,

275
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:32,194
let's start with one
Ferengi Starduster, please.

276
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,821
Extra strong.

277
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,205
Perfect.

278
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:51,880
Uh... I thought the front wheels
were sticking a bit.

279
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:56,260
Unauthorized access
to crew quarters is a crime, Quark.

280
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:59,805
You could have just asked
to use the replicators.

281
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:03,892
There's an old Ferengi saying--
"Never ask when you can take."

282
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,687
Uh, how did you figure it out?

283
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,107
You claimed Rom fixed your replicators.

284
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,984
-So?
-Rom's an idiot.

285
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,444
He couldn't fix a straw if it was bent.

286
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,239
You're right. Rom is an idiot.

287
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,909
Remind me to get rid of him tomorrow.

288
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,748
Based on the levels of the virus
found in the patients' blood,

289
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,959
I believe it's being
absorbed through ingestion.

290
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,919
-You're saying it's in our food?
-Well, that's not possible.

291
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,965
All the food on this station is replicated
and all the replicators use biofilters.

292
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:38,260
They automatically screen out contaminants
including viruses.

293
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:42,014
Major, I've analyzed samples
from replicators all over the station.

294
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,516
Food on the command level is contaminated.

295
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,935
But all of us here have
eaten from those replicators.

296
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,270
How come we're not aphasic?

297
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,105
This virus is highly adaptable.

298
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,525
Its incubation period
seems to vary within each individual.

299
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,069
According to O'Brien's duty log

300
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,363
the last thing he did
before becoming aphasic

301
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,240
was fix the command level replicators.

302
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,619
Get a repair crew over there
to inspect the site.

303
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,537
Let's shut down those replicators.

304
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,081
Maybe we'll be able
to limit further contamination.

305
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,375
I'm afraid that's not going to do it, sir.

306
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,253
I've been getting aphasic patients
from all over the station.

307
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,504
How is that possible?

308
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,714
You can thank Quark.

309
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:19,009
I caught him using a replicator
in one of the vacant crew quarters.

310
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,345
He was producing
his entire menu out of there.

311
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,682
If this virus is present

312
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,269
within a large enough segment
of the population

313
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,396
it could mean...

314
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,107
What is it, Doctor?

315
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,694
I just took an air sample.

316
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,948
[Sisko] The virus...

317
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,033
It's mutated into an airborne variety.

318
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,326
Which means?

319
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,996
Which means the whole station is infected.

320
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,801
[Sisko]<i> Station Log, Stardate 46423.7.</i>

321
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:05,222
<i>Nearly 60% of DS9's population</i>
<i>has now contracted the aphasia virus.</i>

322
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:07,724
<i>We've initiated standard</i>
<i>quarantine procedures</i>

323
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,559
<i>and are advising all incoming ships</i>

324
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,436
<i>to maintain their distance</i>
<i>from the station</i>

325
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,230
<i>until further notice.</i>

326
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,838
I found it in the replicator's
pattern generator.

327
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,799
O'Brien must have accidentally
triggered it when he repaired the system.

328
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:44,928
According to Bashir, it introduced
an anomalous programming sequence

329
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,097
into the materialization subroutine.

330
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,099
In effect, it built the virus

331
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:52,686
directly into the replicated food
at a molecular level.

332
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,397
-So what we have here is sabotage.
-Cardassian sabotage.

333
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,525
-How can you be sure?
-Has a diboridium core for a power source.

334
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,569
That is Cardassian technology.

335
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,113
[man]<i> Bashir to Sisko.</i>

336
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,073
Sisko here.

337
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,284
[man]<i> Commander, I think you'd better</i>
<i>get down here to the infirmary</i>

338
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,452
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

339
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,619
On my way.

340
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,627
You wanted to see me, Doctor?

341
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,131
Jake?

342
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,052
Left... become better...

343
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:28,096
control... entire hope.

344
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,477
[Bashir] We've converted
some empty crew quarters

345
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,603
into a hospital ward.

346
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,729
He'll be well looked after.

347
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,647
I'll take him there myself.

348
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,233
Come on, Jake.
You're going to be all right.

349
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:44,821
Commander, when you've got a moment,
I've found something I'd like to show you.

350
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,577
[people muttering]

351
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,246
[woman] It'll be all right.
Just lay back.

352

353
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,833
[woman] I know,
but just lay back and relax.

354
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:02,464
[Quark] Food... dabo... drinks...

355
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,967
money... hand... mine... give!

356
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,971
Well, Quark, I see even you couldn't
weasel your way clear of this one.

357
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:13,016
You underestimate the Ferengi
immune system, Commander.

358
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,769
I'm merely here visiting
my less fortunate customers

359
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,646
to make sure they're
not faking the illness

360
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,189
to avoid paying their bills.

361
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,774
No one could be that devious.

362
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:21,817
I am.

363
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,737
You... gold... owe... me!

364
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,617
[indistinct conversation]

365
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,286
[Quark] I... now... give...

366
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,288
Up!

367
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,668
We're doing everything possible.

368
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,840
I'll be back as soon as I can.

369
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,724
The virus is synthetic, Commander.

370
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,102
Its nucleotide sequence is too perfect.

371
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,645
It's clearly not natural.

372
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:01,523
You're saying the Cardassians
genetically engineered this thing?

373
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,024
Well, that's what I thought at first,

374
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,235
but I've studied Cardassian
genetic engineering.

375
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:07,946
They always build distinctive
monoclonial links into their DNA.

376
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,698
This virus has none of those features.

377
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,324
All right, then who made it?

378
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,701
Well, that's what I wanted to find out.

379
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,120
So I referenced all known
DNA construction techniques

380
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,663
in the Federation records

381
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,790
and this protein series was the key.

382
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,333
It indicates--

383
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,544
Doctor! Who created this virus?

384
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,045
The Bajorans, sir.

385
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,339
I believe it must have been
a terrorist plot

386
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,425
to sabotage the Cardassians
while they were here.

387
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:36,266
The energy decay of the power core

388
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,644
indicates it dates back
to the building of the station.

389
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,771
[Odo] That's 18 years ago.

390
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,523
I suppose the Bajoran underground

391
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,234
could have smuggled it aboard
during construction...

392
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,196
before I took over as Head of Security.

393
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,740
But why would the underground
go to all the trouble

394
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,575
of planting a booby trap
and not set it off?

395
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,368
Maybe they forgot.

396
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:59,706
No. More likely, they were captured
or killed before they could release it.

397
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,417
We need to find out
who created this virus.

398
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,586
You're our best hope.

399
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:08,924
[sighing] 18 years is a long time.

400
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:13,303
Besides, even if she finds who did this,
that's no guarantee they can help us.

401
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,555
We just have to hope
they remember the antidote.

402
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:18,433
That's assuming they ever
bothered to create one.

403
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,526
It had to be someone
in the underground

404
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,195
familiar with genetic engineering.

405
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,738
[Galis]<i> Eighteen years ago?</i>

406
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,491
<i>Sounds like something Dekon Elig</i>
<i>might have thought up.</i>

407
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:35,825
How can I find him?

408
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,328
<i>The last I heard</i>
<i>he was in a Cardassian prison.</i>

409
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:39,704
Where was he being held?

410
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,207
<i>The Velos VII Internment Camp,</i>

411
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,085
<i>but that was nine years ago.</i>

412
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,923
And you have no idea where he is now?

413
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,967
Think, Galis! This is important.

414
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:56,680
<i>I'm sorry, Kira,</i>
<i>but it was all so long ago.</i>

415
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,728
What is it, Jake?

416
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,730
Roll linger when life.

417
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,232
Roll linger when...

418
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,650
What?

419
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:18,702
Other support, strong courage...

420
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,997
[gasps]

421
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,917
He's running a high fever.

422
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,711
Open way long.

423
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:28,837
Open way.

424
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,301
Doctor, we have an emergency
in crew quarters.

425
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,692
How is he, Doctor?

426
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,402
Not good, I'm afraid.

427
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,988
The virus has attacked
his autonomic nervous system.

428
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,489
Can he be stabilized?

429
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,575
He hasn't responded to neural stimulation.

430
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:02,370
I've given him 30cc's of corophizine
to avoid secondary infection,

431
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,748
but so far, I've been unable
to lower his fever.

432
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,624
What are his chances?

433
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:11,713
Unless I find some way
to counteract the virus,

434
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,049
he'll be dead in 12 hours.

435
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,010
Have you made any progress?

436
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,345
No.

437
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,056
I've tried base pair destabilizers,

438
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:24,768
sequential disruption--
nothing seems to affect it.

439
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,813
Sir, I've got seven other aphasic patients

440
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,524
displaying the same symptoms
as O'Brien here,

441
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,027
and I'm afraid this is only the beginning.

442
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,613
Keep searching, Doctor.

443
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:41,159
I hope Major Kira finds whoever's
responsible for creating this virus.

444
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:44,162
I'd like to meet that person myself.

445

<i>How can I help you?</i>

528
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,489
It depends.

529
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,907
<i>On what?</i>

530
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,451
On whether or not you helped Dekon Elig

531
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,954
plant an aphasia virus here 18 years ago.

532
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:39,040
<i>I have no idea what you're talking about.</i>

533
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,380
Look, Sisko, I'm a security officer--
a good one--

534
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,132
but that doesn't make me qualified
to help you run station operations.

535
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,676
You're probably right, Constable.

536
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,720
But, as you can see,
you're all I've got.

537
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,639
[Kira] Commander...

538
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:59,018
Commander, I think I found our scientist.

539
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,645
-Does he have an antidote?
-I don't know.

540
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,689
He broke the connection
the minute I mentioned the virus.

541
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,857
Major, you mind telling me
where you're going?

542
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:08,444
To continue my conversation
with Dr. Surmak, in person.

543
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,947
Major, I can't allow you
to break quarantine.

544
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,490
We can't risk
spreading the virus to Bajor.

545
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,075
I am well aware of that, Commander.

546
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:17,745
As a matter of fact,
I don't intend to step foot on the planet.

547
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,998
Better let her go, Sisko.

548
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,042
She's all we've got.

549
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:38,182
Let's just hope there's someone left
to greet her when she returns.

550
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,157
Jake.

551
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,368
How's it going?

552
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,675
I've missed you.

553
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:16,054
I know things don't look
too good right now,

554
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,264
but they'll get better.

555
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:21,225
You have to believe that...

556
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:25,063
because I'm not going
to lose you, Jake.

557
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,523
You hear me?

558
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,318
I'm not going to lose you.

559
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,376
You better take a look at this.

560
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,295
We have activity on Docking Port 5.

561
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:50,880
I think a ship is about to depart.

562
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,882
Docking Port 5? That's Jaheel's ship.

563
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,425
Put him on screen.

564
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:02,975
Captain, your ship has
not been cleared for departure.

565
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,435
The mooring clamps are locked,

566
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,646
and I don't intend to release them.

567
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,981
<i>I suggest you change your mind.</i>

568
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,651
<i>I'm taking aft thrusters to one half.</i>

569
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:18,157
Captain, cut your engines
before you rip your ship apart.

570
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,993
He's not reducing power.

571
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,664
Jaheel, I'm ordering you to stand down.

572
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,916
<i>Your orders are no concern of mine.</i>

573
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:29,919
<i>My entire crew has been</i>
<i>confined to your hospital.</i>

574
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,922
<i>I must leave now</i>
<i>while I can still function.</i>

575
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:37,135
Look, I understand that you're frightened
but believe me, you're better off here.

576
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:40,012
You don't want to be out there alone
and get hit by the virus.

577
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,723
<i>Don't worry about me, I'm fine.</i>

578
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,477
<i>And I plan to stay that way.</i>

579
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,563
-And if you think you're go--
-[cuts transmission]

580
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,316
We'll have to retract the clamps.

581
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,487
Once he's clear of the station
we can grab him with a tractor beam.

582
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,662
-Damn.
-What's wrong?

583
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,581
There's too much stress
on the mooring clamps.

584
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,040
They're not retracting.

585
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,877
[groaning]

586
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,462
[console beeping]

587
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,549
His aft isolation plate buckled.

588
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,468
His main power core's been ruptured.

589
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:22,513
If the internal fuel cells collapse,
the whole ship will explode.

590
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,141
And take half the docking ring with it.

591
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,695
Computer, isolate a com line

592
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:41,073
to the Ilvian Medical Complex
Administrator's office.

593
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,992
[female voice on computer]<i> Line isolated.</i>

594
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,994
Scan office for life-forms.

595
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,205
<i>One life-form present.</i>

596
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:50,249
Lock on and stand by to transport.

597
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,504
<i>-This is Dr. Surmak.</i>
-Hello again, Doctor.

598
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,465
Just checking to see
you're in your office.

599
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,467
<i>I have nothing to say to you--</i>

600
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,101
Hello again, Doctor.

601
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,270
This is outrageous.

602
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,023
I demand you return me
to my office immediately.

603
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:16,859
Relax, Doctor. You won't be gone long.

604
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:25,117
Try to reestablish visual contact
with Jaheel's ship.

605
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,914
[Odo] No response. His com lines are down.

606
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,917
Bypass communications
through a secondary grid.

607
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,544
See if you can switch
to external pickups.

608
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,879
Got it.

609
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:42,802
His fire control systems
don't appear to be working.

610
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:47,056
We have about 15 minutes
before the fuel cells collapse.

611
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,851
I hope you feel better than you look.

612
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,854
Must be that damn virus.

613
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,773
This is Sisko.

614
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:59,777
Any station personnel who can understand
what I'm saying, come to Ops immediately.

615
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,404
We need help up here.

616
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,698
We have to get that ship
away from the station.

617
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,992
Why don't we explode
the mooring clamps?

618
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,577
The blast should push the ship
away from the docking ring.

619
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,955
We'll have to get down there
and blow it manually.

620
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,748
[groans]

621
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,166
I'll do it.

622
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,377
All right.

623
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,504
You can cross barrels.

624
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,340
All job appalled.

625
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,259
What was that?

626
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,178
Bread...

627
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,763
the arrive...

628
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,807
seen earlier.

629
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,894
Oh, I see.

630
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,905
Major, this is kidnapping.

631
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,199
Turn this ship around
or I swear you will spend

632
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,827
the rest of your life
in Kran-Tobol Prison.

633
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,205
Fine. But first, we need your help.

634
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,000
The aphasia virus is spreading
through the station.

635
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,543
Why come to me?

636
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,628
You helped create the virus, didn't you?

637
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,672
No, I had practically
nothing to do with it.

638
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,883
Dekon Elig created the virus.

639
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,885
I was merely his medical assistant.

640
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:08,220
That seems like a lifetime ago now.

641
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,681
I was only in the underground
for six months

642
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,224
before we were captured.

643
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,226
I am not responsible for this.

644
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,978
I am not looking to place blame!

645
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,022
All I want is the antidote.

646
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,941
I don't know of any antidote.

647
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,402
If Dekon created one, he never told me.

648
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,779
Listen, Surmak.

649
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,114
I have a station full of dying people

650
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,951
and you are the closest thing there is
to an expert on this virus.

651
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,787
I sympathize, Major,

652
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,955
but I don't think I can help you.

653
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,083
All right.

654
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,878
Then how about helping yourself?

655
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,505
Meaning what?

656
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,131
Meaning...

657
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,761
I've been infected
with your virus, Doctor...

658
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,556
so now you're infected, too.

659
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,940
To anyone who can hear me, this is Odo.

660
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,066
Sisko's infected.

661
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,276
I could really use some help here in Ops.

662
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:08,030
Do I detect a note of panic in your voice?

663
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,281
Quark.

664
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:13,160
Am I to believe that you're
volunteering to help?

665
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,621
Who said anything about volunteering?

666
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:18,207
We can haggle over price later.

667
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,542
Now, um...

668
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,586
how may I be of use?

669
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:25,297
I need to get to Docking Port 5 now.

670
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,591
That ship's going to explode
in five minutes.

671
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,468
I'll beam you over.

672
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,929
-You?
-Relax.

673
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:35,766
I served on a Ferengi freighter
for eight years.

674
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,310
All right.

675
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:42,440
I must have witnessed the procedure
hundreds of times.

676
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:46,318
Witnessed? You mean to say you never
handled the controls yourself?

677
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,778
Energizing!

678
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,745
[sighing]

679
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,258
Kira to Ops. Approaching Landing Pad 7.

680
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,677
Request clearance
to initiate docking procedure.

681
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,555
[Quark]<i> Welcome back.</i>
<i>I could use some help up here.</i>

682
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,266
Quark, what are you doing in Ops?

683
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,310
[laughing]

684
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:24,857
First thing I need to see

685
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,568
is your doctor's viral
characterization research.

686
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,282
He was beginning to develop
an antidote series.

687
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,825
Let's take a look at that.

688
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,702
[Kira] Listen, Doctor, um...

689
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:37,870
I'll be in Ops.

690
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,331
If you need me, use this string impact.

691
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,125
Lot show red intense.

692
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,046
I think you'd better sit down, Major.

693
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,677
[alarm wailing]

694
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:09,235
[Jaheel] Dog fellow distance.

695
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:10,903
[Odo] Yeah, tell me about it.

696
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:13,072
[Quark]<i> Odo, you'd better hurry up.</i>

697
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:15,407
That ship's going to explode
in one minute.

698
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,538
Virum protein sheath.

699
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,374
Nucleotide sequence.

700
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,251
Yes.

701
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,418
That's right.

702
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,754
It's an adaptive, synaptic inhibitor.

703
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,756
Dekon was brilliant.

704
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,424
No doubt of that.

705
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,011
I think we've found your antidote, Major.

[Quark]<i> 40 seconds.</i>

707
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,114
30 seconds. Hurry!

708
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,157
I know, I know.

709
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,706
20 seconds!

710
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,338
Ten seconds!

[Quark]<i> Odo? Quark to Odo.</i>

714
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:39,700
You still with us?

715
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:42,453
Try not to sound too disappointed.

716
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:46,081
Now, about that little matter
of my hazard pay...

717
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,626
Why, you...

718
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,923
Come on. Come on.

[Sisko]<i> Station Log, Stardate 46425.8.</i>

720
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:04,600
<i>With the help of Dr. Bashir's notes,</i>

721
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:08,145
<i>Dr. Surmak was able to find</i>
<i>an antidote for the aphasia virus.</i>

722
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:11,273
<i>We are continuing to administer</i>
<i>it throughout the station</i>

723
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:14,068
<i>and things are slowly</i>
<i>returning to normal.</i>

724
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,736
Good to have you back, Chief.

725
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,279
Thank you, sir.

726
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,656
Coffee, black.

727
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:26,872
O'Brien!
