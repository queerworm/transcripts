1
00:00:15,025 --> 00:00:16,654
Sisko to Dax.

2
00:00:21,806 --> 00:00:23,469
Yes, Captain.

3
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,645
We arrive at Starbase 375
in five minutes.

4
00:00:27,686 --> 00:00:29,212
I'll meet you
in the transporter room.

5
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:30,589
Dax out.

6
00:00:31,795 --> 00:00:35,428
Ooh... now, that's what I call
really bad timing.

7
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,303
I have to go.

8
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:51,603
Jadzia...

9
00:00:51,638 --> 00:00:53,734
there is just one more thing.

10
00:00:53,776 --> 00:00:56,772
As long as it's not
about the wedding.

11
00:00:56,816 --> 00:01:00,119
When we exchange our vows,
you must remember

12
00:01:00,157 --> 00:01:02,594
to present your <i>d'k tahg</i>
to General Martok

13
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:06,228
as a formal request for him
to accept you into our House.

14
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,434
But I don't want
to join his House.

15
00:01:08,475 --> 00:01:09,568
What?

16
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,171
I don't want to get caught up

17
00:01:11,214 --> 00:01:12,478
in all those blood feuds.

18
00:01:12,518 --> 00:01:14,579
Every time a member
of the House of Martok

19
00:01:14,622 --> 00:01:17,025
gets dishonored or killed

20
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,927
I'll have to drop
whatever I'm doing

21
00:01:18,965 --> 00:01:21,596
and rush off on some quest
for vengeance.

22
00:01:21,638 --> 00:01:23,471
It's boring, Worf.

23
00:01:23,508 --> 00:01:26,207
If you refuse,
it will be a grave dishonor.

24
00:01:26,247 --> 00:01:28,480
General Martok
will not understand...

25
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:30,045
Worf.

26
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,558
I'm joking.

27
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:38,166
So you will join our House?

28
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:41,238
Of course I will.

29
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,776
I can see our lives together
will not be easy.

30
00:01:44,822 --> 00:01:46,291
True.

31
00:01:46,325 --> 00:01:48,056
But they'll be fun.

32
00:01:59,822 --> 00:02:01,155
Channel open.

33
00:02:01,191 --> 00:02:04,221
This is General Martok
of the IKS <i>Rotarran</i>

34
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:06,292
requesting permission
to dock.

35
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,636
General, you're cleared
for docking at Bay 11.

36
00:02:08,674 --> 00:02:09,973
Thank God.

37
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:12,608
I never thought I'd miss
Starfleet field rations.

38
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,746
Give me
some freeze-dried peaches

39
00:02:14,788 --> 00:02:15,983
or some powdered carrots...

40
00:02:16,024 --> 00:02:17,323
anything, as long
as it isn't moving.

41
00:02:17,394 --> 00:02:19,023
It's not the food,
it's the singing.

42
00:02:19,064 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh! Till all hours
of the night.

43
00:02:21,035 --> 00:02:22,128
If I have to listen

44
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,662
to another ballad
about the honored dead

45
00:02:23,707 --> 00:02:25,609
I'll go stark-raving mad.

46
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,344
Captain Sisko, Admiral Ross

47
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:30,615
extends his compliments
for a job well done

48
00:02:30,656 --> 00:02:32,558
and requests that you
and your senior staff

49
00:02:32,594 --> 00:02:35,464
beam to his conference room
for debriefing immediately.

50
00:02:35,499 --> 00:02:37,264
Tell the Admiral
we're on our way.

51
00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:38,272
Starbase out.

52
00:02:38,306 --> 00:02:39,467
Once again,

53
00:02:39,508 --> 00:02:41,273
thank you for rescuing us,
General.

54
00:02:41,312 --> 00:02:44,148
Hmm. Try not to get
too comfortable

55
00:02:44,186 --> 00:02:46,019
lounging around the starbase.

56
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:47,958
We need you back in the fight.

57
00:02:47,994 --> 00:02:50,090
Are you a betting man, General?

58
00:02:50,132 --> 00:02:52,626
One of my many pleasures.

59
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:54,641
Then a barrel of bloodwine says

60
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,739
I set foot on Deep
Space 9 before you do.

61
00:03:00,756 --> 00:03:02,225
Done.

62
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:10,667
General, I just received word

63
00:03:10,711 --> 00:03:13,114
the replacements
from the <i>Vor'nak</i> are here.

64
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,345
Good.

65
00:03:14,385 --> 00:03:15,945
Look at this, Worf...

66
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:17,788
barely moving.

67
00:03:17,826 --> 00:03:22,131
I'd give my good eye
for a plate of fresh <i>gagh.</i>

68
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,071
How many replacements?

69
00:03:24,107 --> 00:03:25,234
Five.

70
00:03:25,276 --> 00:03:27,543
Five?

71
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:29,711
I requested 15.

72
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:31,517
General Tanas
could only give us five.

73
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:35,932
We keep falling back.

74
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:39,337
The Dominion
keeps pushing forward.

75
00:03:39,373 --> 00:03:43,108
I tell you, Worf,
war is much more fun

76
00:03:43,148 --> 00:03:44,207
when you're winning!

77
00:03:44,251 --> 00:03:46,848
Defeat makes my wounds ache.

78
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,325
<i>Pat'leH pum tliH-takk!</i>

79
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,761
Oh, the replacements.

80
00:03:59,518 --> 00:04:01,488
I am General Martok.

81
00:04:01,522 --> 00:04:04,289
Welcome to the <i>Rotarran.</i>

82
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,161
May you prove worthy
of this ship

83
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,828
and bring honor to her name.

84
00:04:07,869 --> 00:04:13,108
This is a glorious moment
in the history of the Empire

85
00:04:13,147 --> 00:04:16,552
a chapter that will be written
with your blood.

86
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:20,222
Fight well, and our people
will sing your praises

87
00:04:20,263 --> 00:04:22,928
for a thousand years.

88
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:27,776
Fail, and there will be
no more songs, no more honor

89
00:04:27,813 --> 00:04:30,307
no more Empire.

90
00:04:30,352 --> 00:04:33,484
Who among you hears the cry
of the warrior

91
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:35,996
calling you to glory?

92
00:04:36,031 --> 00:04:37,466
<i>Qapla'!</i>

93
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:42,206
Who offers their life
for the Empire?

94
00:04:42,245 --> 00:04:43,714
N'Garen, daughter of Tse'Dek!

95
00:04:43,748 --> 00:04:47,051
Katogh, son of Ch'Pok!

96
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:48,922
Koth, son of Larna!

97
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,986
Doran, daughter of W'Mar!

98
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:54,835
Alexander Rozhenko.

99
00:04:54,872 --> 00:04:56,842
Alexander.

100
00:04:57,846 --> 00:04:58,939
Rozhenko?

101
00:04:58,981 --> 00:05:01,748
Of what House is Rozhenko?

102
00:05:02,723 --> 00:05:04,659
Of no House, sir.

103
00:05:06,398 --> 00:05:08,665
My honor will be my own.

104
00:05:08,703 --> 00:05:10,195
Well...

105
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,407
there will be plenty of honor
for the taking on this ship...

106
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:15,110
enough for all of you.

107
00:05:15,151 --> 00:05:18,124
I accept your lives
into my hands.

108
00:05:18,157 --> 00:05:20,628
Glory to you,
and to the Empire!

109
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:23,960
<i>Yih-Ghom-HAH!</i>

110
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:34,052
This Alexander Rozhenko...

111
00:05:34,092 --> 00:05:35,755
you know him?

112
00:05:39,103 --> 00:05:41,096
He is my son.

113
00:07:49,934 --> 00:07:53,339
The next thing we need
is a secure way to communicate

114
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,038
with our contacts on Bajor.

115
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,548
Oh...

116
00:07:56,582 --> 00:07:59,247
the Cardassians
are extremely adept

117
00:07:59,356 --> 00:08:00,723
at locating the source

118
00:08:00,758 --> 00:08:03,195
of any illicit
subspace transmission.

119
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,667
Well, we'll just have to
be smarter than they are.

120
00:08:06,705 --> 00:08:08,174
Hi.

121
00:08:09,243 --> 00:08:10,644
Mind if I join you?

122
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,449
You already have.

123
00:08:14,923 --> 00:08:16,050
I want in.

124
00:08:16,093 --> 00:08:17,756
In on what?

125
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,201
Your resistance cell.

126
00:08:21,237 --> 00:08:22,227
What cell?

127
00:08:22,272 --> 00:08:23,331
Come on, Major

128
00:08:23,374 --> 00:08:24,866
I have my sources.

129
00:08:24,911 --> 00:08:26,471
How reassuring.

130
00:08:26,515 --> 00:08:27,814
I can help.

131
00:08:27,852 --> 00:08:28,979
How?

132
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,249
As a reporter

133
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,386
I hear things...
people talk to me.

134
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,829
About what?

135
00:08:35,368 --> 00:08:37,669
Major, all I'm asking for
is a chance.

136
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:42,106
It's time, Major.

137
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,551
Oh...

138
00:08:43,586 --> 00:08:44,953
already?

139
00:08:44,989 --> 00:08:46,390
1457 hours.

140
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,862
The shuttle will be docking
in three minutes.

141
00:08:48,898 --> 00:08:50,663
I better get going.

142
00:08:50,701 --> 00:08:53,468
Don't want to keep him waiting.

143
00:08:53,507 --> 00:08:55,500
I see Gul Dukat's
still having you meet him

144
00:08:55,546 --> 00:08:57,345
every time he returns
to the station.

145
00:08:59,721 --> 00:09:01,851
Like I said, I hear things.

146
00:09:01,892 --> 00:09:03,191
Um...

147
00:09:03,229 --> 00:09:06,396
shouldn't you be wearing
your dress uniform?

148
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,511
You look lovely
just the way you are.

149
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,178
So am I in or not?

150
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,601
You... don't want to get
involved with this.

151
00:09:24,676 --> 00:09:28,309
But... if you are looking
for something to do

152
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:30,253
I could use another waiter.

153
00:09:49,196 --> 00:09:51,029
Ah, Major Kira!

154
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:53,128
So good to see you again.

155
00:09:53,172 --> 00:09:54,903
You're out of uniform, Major.

156
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,312
Bajorans could use
a lesson in respect.

157
00:09:57,348 --> 00:09:58,373
Damar, please.

158
00:09:58,483 --> 00:09:59,975
This is a happy occasion.

159
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,821
Let's not spoil it.

160
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,762
I have a surprise for you.

161
00:10:08,105 --> 00:10:09,506
Nerys!

162
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,875
Ziyal.

163
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:12,938
I am so glad to see you.

164
00:10:12,983 --> 00:10:14,212
What are you doing here?

165
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:15,845
You're supposed
to be on Bajor.

166
00:10:15,888 --> 00:10:18,587
I talked her into taking
a little sabbatical

167
00:10:18,627 --> 00:10:20,153
from the University.

168
00:10:20,198 --> 00:10:22,191
Talked her into it?

169
00:10:22,236 --> 00:10:23,933
It didn't take much convincing.

170
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:25,567
Why don't you and I
have dinner tonight

171
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,909
and I'll tell you all about it?

172
00:10:26,946 --> 00:10:28,039
All right.

173
00:10:28,082 --> 00:10:29,050
Splendid!

174
00:10:29,084 --> 00:10:31,578
We'll dine in my quarters
at 2200 hours.

175
00:10:31,623 --> 00:10:32,922
Wait a minute,
I didn't mean...

176
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,827
I can't tell you
how much I've missed you.

177
00:10:34,864 --> 00:10:36,834
Come along, Ziyal.

178
00:10:36,868 --> 00:10:38,497
I'll see you tonight.

179
00:10:40,275 --> 00:10:41,574
All right.

180
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,235
You sent for me, General.

181
00:10:54,273 --> 00:10:56,038
Orders at last.

182
00:10:56,077 --> 00:10:59,209
We are to escort a convoy
to Donatu V.

183
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,947
The last three convoys
that were sent there

184
00:11:00,987 --> 00:11:02,684
were destroyed by the Jem'Hadar.

185
00:11:02,724 --> 00:11:04,785
Which is why this one
must get through.

186
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,766
How many ships
will form the escort?

187
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,240
The <i>Rotarran</i> is all
the High Council can spare.

188
00:11:10,274 --> 00:11:12,438
A vital mission, impossible odds

189
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,473
and a ruthless enemy.

190
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,851
What more could we ask for?

191
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:19,690
I tell you, Worf,
I feel young again.

192
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:21,962
Here's the briefing.

193
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,833
Start battle drills
immediately.

194
00:11:23,872 --> 00:11:26,503
Train them hard.

195
00:11:26,577 --> 00:11:28,376
By the time we join the convoy

196
00:11:28,414 --> 00:11:31,215
they will have the reflexes
of a Norpin falcon.

197
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:32,484
I expect nothing less.

198
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:36,724
Worf, one moment.

199
00:11:36,766 --> 00:11:39,260
We have shed blood together

200
00:11:39,305 --> 00:11:41,538
escaped from a Jem'Hadar prison
together.

201
00:11:41,644 --> 00:11:44,548
You have pledged yourself
and your life to my House.

202
00:11:44,617 --> 00:11:46,018
Yet in all this time

203
00:11:46,053 --> 00:11:48,854
you have never once mentioned
that you had a son.

204
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,901
It is a... difficult subject
to discuss.

205
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,377
That much is obvious.

206
00:11:59,817 --> 00:12:02,949
Alexander and I
were never close.

207
00:12:02,991 --> 00:12:06,522
His mother was only half-Klingon
and was disdainful of our ways.

208
00:12:06,632 --> 00:12:08,158
I see.

209
00:12:08,202 --> 00:12:10,400
So you allowed her
to raise the boy.

210
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,669
No, General.

211
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,737
She was killed
when he was very young.

212
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,547
He spent a short time with me
aboard the <i>Enterprise</i>

213
00:12:16,621 --> 00:12:18,454
but after that,
I sent him to live

214
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:19,550
with my foster parents on Earth.

215
00:12:19,627 --> 00:12:20,617
Why?

216
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:23,931
He showed...

217
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,909
no interest
in becoming a warrior.

218
00:12:26,943 --> 00:12:29,437
It was difficult,
but I learned to accept it

219
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:32,944
and, in time, encouraged him
to find his own path.

220
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,188
Then why has he joined
the Klingon defense forces?

221
00:12:35,228 --> 00:12:36,595
I do not know.

222
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,601
I have not spoken with him.

223
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,907
This is not good, my friend.

224
00:12:42,944 --> 00:12:45,211
When a father and son
do not speak

225
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,314
it means
there's trouble between them.

226
00:12:50,328 --> 00:12:53,961
General, I prefer to handle this
my own way.

227
00:12:54,003 --> 00:12:55,666
Then do so.

228
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:11,272
Enter.

229
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:19,115
Bekk Alexander Rozhenko
reporting as ordered, sir.

230
00:13:20,128 --> 00:13:21,461
You have grown.

231
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:24,002
So I've been told.

232
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:25,972
How are your grandparents?

233
00:13:26,007 --> 00:13:28,308
Your parents were in good health
when I last saw them.

234
00:13:29,314 --> 00:13:31,045
Do they know you are here?

235
00:13:31,085 --> 00:13:32,918
They weren't pleased
about my decision

236
00:13:32,955 --> 00:13:35,392
but when they realized
I was determined to enlist

237
00:13:35,428 --> 00:13:38,229
they supported me
as they always have.

238
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:41,400
I know we have not seen
each other for some time

239
00:13:41,508 --> 00:13:43,137
but let us talk
as father and son.

240
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:45,412
I am not here to call you
"Father."

241
00:13:45,483 --> 00:13:47,818
I am here to serve the Empire.

242
00:13:47,855 --> 00:13:50,224
Serving the Empire was not
one of your priorities

243
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,353
when last we spoke.

244
00:13:51,396 --> 00:13:54,858
As you say,
that was some time ago.

245
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,071
Did you think enlisting
would please me?

246
00:14:00,115 --> 00:14:03,782
Pleasing you did not enter
into my decision.

247
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,857
With all due respect, sir

248
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:10,200
does this conversation
have any bearing

249
00:14:10,238 --> 00:14:11,969
on my duties aboard this ship?

250
00:14:12,008 --> 00:14:14,206
Stop pretending to be a warrior!

251
00:14:14,247 --> 00:14:16,114
We both know
you do not belong here!

252
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,555
You heard what I expect
from the rest of the crew.

253
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:21,151
Twice that, I expect from you.

254
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:22,755
Do we understand each other?

255
00:14:23,767 --> 00:14:25,293
Perfectly.

256
00:14:27,008 --> 00:14:28,237
You may go.

257
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,619
Come in.

258
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,286
Nerys, you're early.

259
00:14:51,328 --> 00:14:52,922
I've just started the <i>ramufta.</i>

260
00:14:52,965 --> 00:14:54,058
Ziyal...

261
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,128
I'm not having dinner
with you tonight.

262
00:14:56,172 --> 00:14:59,076
Oh.

263
00:14:59,112 --> 00:15:01,173
It's because of
my father, isn't it?

264
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:03,312
That's right.

265
00:15:03,355 --> 00:15:05,451
I thought you might
change your mind.

266
00:15:05,492 --> 00:15:08,259
I was hoping I was wrong.

267
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:10,896
Ziyal, what are you doing
back on the station?

268
00:15:10,938 --> 00:15:12,635
Please don't be upset with me.

269
00:15:12,675 --> 00:15:14,474
I know how hard you worked

270
00:15:14,545 --> 00:15:17,016
to arrange things
for me on Bajor.

271
00:15:17,051 --> 00:15:18,748
I tried.
I really tried.

272
00:15:18,788 --> 00:15:20,485
I'm not upset with you.

273
00:15:20,558 --> 00:15:21,993
I'm...

274
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:23,658
I'm a little confused.

275
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:24,792
What happened?

276
00:15:26,405 --> 00:15:28,501
It wasn't any one thing.

277
00:15:28,576 --> 00:15:30,307
The students
at the University...

278
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:33,080
everybody was... polite.

279
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:37,288
But then I'd see them whispering
in the hallways...

280
00:15:37,328 --> 00:15:39,355
staring at me.

281
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,304
I'm the daughter of Gul Dukat.

282
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:43,933
My father is leading a war

283
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,037
against the Emissary
of the Prophets.

284
00:15:46,082 --> 00:15:48,553
I don't know what made me think
I belonged there.

285
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:53,393
This station is the closest
thing I have to a home.

286
00:15:53,431 --> 00:15:55,492
You're here.

287
00:15:55,535 --> 00:15:57,198
My father is here.

288
00:15:57,239 --> 00:16:01,408
But the last time you defied
him, he left you here to die.

289
00:16:03,219 --> 00:16:05,121
We talked about that.

290
00:16:05,157 --> 00:16:06,751
He admits he overreacted.

291
00:16:06,794 --> 00:16:08,525
But family loyalty is important

292
00:16:08,631 --> 00:16:10,692
to my father
and he felt I betrayed him.

293
00:16:10,735 --> 00:16:12,534
You betrayed him?

294
00:16:12,573 --> 00:16:14,806
I think
it's the other way around!

295
00:16:14,844 --> 00:16:16,336
He misses me.

296
00:16:16,381 --> 00:16:18,579
And I've missed him.

297
00:16:19,755 --> 00:16:22,853
I have to give him a chance.

298
00:16:22,896 --> 00:16:25,231
He's all I have, except for you.

299
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:28,170
I was hoping

300
00:16:28,207 --> 00:16:30,735
you would have dinner
with us tonight because...

301
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,272
well, there's something special

302
00:16:32,316 --> 00:16:33,979
I wanted to share
with both of you.

303
00:16:36,592 --> 00:16:38,619
But I guess that's impossible.

304
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,133
Uh...

305
00:16:45,645 --> 00:16:47,478
All right, I'll be here.

306
00:16:47,517 --> 00:16:49,647
But I won't guarantee
it's going to be any fun.

307
00:16:52,126 --> 00:16:54,062
I promise my father will behave.

308
00:17:29,198 --> 00:17:30,565
Is this seat taken?

309
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,365
Alexander Rozhenko.

310
00:17:32,404 --> 00:17:35,377
We were holding it just for you.

311
00:17:35,411 --> 00:17:37,939
I am honored.

312
00:17:37,983 --> 00:17:40,716
The honor is ours.

313
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,695
Please.

314
00:17:47,437 --> 00:17:52,278
<i>Bregit</i> lung,
an excellent choice!

315
00:17:52,315 --> 00:17:54,752
Would you care
for some <i>grapok</i> sauce?

316
00:17:54,787 --> 00:17:56,780
Uh, no, thank you.

317
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,319
Oh, you must try some.

318
00:17:59,364 --> 00:18:02,268
It brings out the flavor.

319
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:08,709
That's enough.

320
00:18:08,751 --> 00:18:10,345
Thank you.

321
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:13,623
Some bloodwine to wash it down?

322
00:18:15,934 --> 00:18:17,233
Why are you laughing?

323
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:23,004
Or perhaps the son of our
illustrious First Officer

324
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:25,418
would prefer an Earth beverage.

325
00:18:25,454 --> 00:18:29,259
A glass of root beer
with a lump of ice cream?

326
00:18:29,297 --> 00:18:30,492
Mmm...

327
00:18:33,639 --> 00:18:34,938
Are you mocking me?

328
00:18:34,975 --> 00:18:39,178
Now why would I mock you,
son of Worf?

329
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:41,882
I am called Rozhenko.

330
00:18:43,093 --> 00:18:47,398
I will call you
whatever I please.

331
00:18:47,436 --> 00:18:51,241
And you will learn to like it.

332
00:18:56,456 --> 00:18:58,825
Does the son
of Starfleet's finest

333
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:01,458
think he is too good
to eat with us?

334
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:04,807
No.

335
00:19:04,841 --> 00:19:05,934
Have some lung!

336
00:19:13,594 --> 00:19:16,498
I do not like your smile!

337
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:20,166
Perhaps I will
cut you a new one.

338
00:19:51,911 --> 00:19:55,078
He fights like a Ferengi!

339
00:20:06,243 --> 00:20:08,110
<i>Shakk-TAH!</i>

340
00:20:19,204 --> 00:20:21,641
Your combat training
has been sadly neglected

341
00:20:21,676 --> 00:20:23,943
little one.

342
00:20:23,981 --> 00:20:26,248
I will teach you a new lesson...

343
00:20:26,287 --> 00:20:28,690
one that you will
not soon forget!

344
00:20:29,694 --> 00:20:31,129
Enough.

345
00:20:40,216 --> 00:20:42,346
You have no right to interfere!

346
00:20:44,427 --> 00:20:45,794
You will both report

347
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:48,357
to the Medical Ward
immediately

348
00:20:48,401 --> 00:20:49,665
and when they have finished
with you

349
00:20:49,705 --> 00:20:50,695
you will remain in quarters

350
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,935
until your next watch.

351
00:20:51,977 --> 00:20:54,073
The rest of you,
back to your stations!

352
00:20:55,484 --> 00:20:56,713
Now!

353
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:11,612
Are you going to fight
the Jem'Hadar for him as well?

354
00:21:24,948 --> 00:21:27,476
Vedek Nane taught me
to focus intently

355
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:29,457
on the image
that I want to evoke

356
00:21:29,492 --> 00:21:31,725
to allow it to fully form
in my mind

357
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,766
before I even pick up the brush.

358
00:21:35,605 --> 00:21:37,974
Well, what do you think?

359
00:21:38,011 --> 00:21:41,314
They're... very good.

360
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:42,752
You think so?

361
00:21:42,822 --> 00:21:45,920
They remind me
of Vedek Topek's early work.

362
00:21:45,961 --> 00:21:48,057
How ironic.

363
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,364
I was about to say

364
00:21:49,402 --> 00:21:53,901
they're similar in style
to Napart Malor

365
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:56,782
the founder of the Valonnan
School on Cardassia.

366
00:21:56,818 --> 00:21:59,255
The Director of the Cardassian
Institute of Art

367
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,349
said the same thing.

368
00:22:00,393 --> 00:22:02,694
You spoke with the Director?

369
00:22:02,731 --> 00:22:04,827
I sent him some of my drawings.

370
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,499
You should have told me, Ziyal.

371
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,307
I could have arranged
for you to meet him in person.

372
00:22:09,346 --> 00:22:11,282
I know.

373
00:22:11,317 --> 00:22:14,313
I wanted to do this on my own.

374
00:22:14,357 --> 00:22:17,158
He said I have a real gift.

375
00:22:18,266 --> 00:22:20,760
The Institute is having

376
00:22:20,871 --> 00:22:23,434
an exhibition of new artists
next month.

377
00:22:23,477 --> 00:22:25,573
He might want
to include my work.

378
00:22:25,615 --> 00:22:26,914
Wonderful!

379
00:22:26,951 --> 00:22:28,250
It's a chance to show

380
00:22:28,288 --> 00:22:30,418
that both Bajorans
and Cardassians

381
00:22:30,459 --> 00:22:32,555
look at the universe
the same way.

382
00:22:32,597 --> 00:22:35,228
And that's what I want to do
with my work...

383
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:36,568
bring people together.

384
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,820
I guess it sounds
a little silly.

385
00:22:44,924 --> 00:22:47,452
On the contrary, my dear

386
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:51,163
you're quite eloquent.

387
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:55,305
Are you ready for dessert?

388
00:22:55,347 --> 00:22:56,714
Yes!

389
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,014
I'm not going anywhere.

390
00:22:58,053 --> 00:22:59,248
Good.

391
00:23:02,329 --> 00:23:03,889
I don't believe the change.

392
00:23:03,933 --> 00:23:05,527
I have never seen her so...

393
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:06,697
- Happy?
- Yeah.

394
00:23:06,739 --> 00:23:08,072
Neither have I, Major.

395
00:23:08,109 --> 00:23:10,740
I mean, she's finally
found something...

396
00:23:10,781 --> 00:23:12,751
a talent, a direction.

397
00:23:12,785 --> 00:23:14,812
I'm reluctant to admit it

398
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:18,193
but you were right
to send her to Bajor.

399
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:21,295
I'm glad it worked out.

400
00:23:21,338 --> 00:23:27,011
We seldom see eye-to-eye, Major

401
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:29,487
but I know you care
about my daughter

402
00:23:29,522 --> 00:23:32,050
and for that, I'm grateful.

403
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:48,326
There is only one thing I hate
about convoy duty...

404
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:51,239
it's the waiting.

405
00:23:51,275 --> 00:23:55,649
You'd think after all these
years, I'd be used to it.

406
00:23:56,854 --> 00:24:00,191
But nothing breaks
the tension better

407
00:24:00,228 --> 00:24:02,461
than a tankard of <i>warnog.</i>

408
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,632
Except maybe a good brawl.

409
00:24:07,043 --> 00:24:09,310
You heard about the fight
in the mess hall.

410
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:12,344
Yes, but not
from my First Officer.

411
00:24:12,389 --> 00:24:17,196
I lost him the moment his son
stepped aboard this ship.

412
00:24:20,372 --> 00:24:22,468
You think I acted improperly?

413
00:24:24,816 --> 00:24:28,814
It is not an easy thing
to stand aside

414
00:24:28,858 --> 00:24:32,423
and watch someone
injure your son.

415
00:24:32,466 --> 00:24:34,368
Alexander was no match
for Ch'Targh.

416
00:24:34,403 --> 00:24:35,963
He would have killed the boy.

417
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:38,774
Ch'Targh might have
cut him a little

418
00:24:38,813 --> 00:24:41,046
and maybe broken a few bones

419
00:24:41,085 --> 00:24:42,884
but nothing more.

420
00:24:42,922 --> 00:24:46,521
You told me Alexander
never wanted to be a warrior.

421
00:24:46,564 --> 00:24:48,865
Clearly he has changed his mind.

422
00:24:48,902 --> 00:24:52,673
Worf, you are his First Officer.

423
00:24:52,744 --> 00:24:55,272
Teach him to survive.

424
00:24:55,316 --> 00:24:57,081
The Jem'Hadar
will be less forgiving

425
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,885
than Ch'Targh.

426
00:24:58,924 --> 00:25:00,416
Battle stations.

427
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,362
Alert Status 1.
Captain to the Bridge.

428
00:25:03,334 --> 00:25:04,894
Report!

429
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:07,101
Jem'Hadar attack ship

430
00:25:07,142 --> 00:25:09,409
bearing 170 mark 045.

431
00:25:09,447 --> 00:25:13,182
Estimated weapons range
in 22 seconds.

432
00:25:13,222 --> 00:25:14,782
On screen.

433
00:25:17,365 --> 00:25:18,664
Where is it?

434
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,261
I have no target on my sensors.

435
00:25:21,306 --> 00:25:22,274
Switching to manual.

436
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:24,473
Reroute primary sensors
to weapons control.

437
00:25:24,513 --> 00:25:25,503
Aye, sir.

438
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,251
The Jem'Hadar has launched
two torpedoes.

439
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:30,486
At us or the convoy?

440
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:32,621
At us.

441
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:33,929
Impact in ten seconds.

442
00:25:33,968 --> 00:25:36,166
Drop cloak, raise shields,
evasive action.

443
00:25:39,146 --> 00:25:42,210
Torpedoes still locked on to us.

444
00:25:42,252 --> 00:25:44,222
They will hit in four seconds.

445
00:25:44,257 --> 00:25:45,225
Three...

446
00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:46,192
Brace for impact.

447
00:25:46,228 --> 00:25:47,161
Two...

448
00:25:47,196 --> 00:25:48,688
one...

449
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,409
Reinitialize primary sensors.

450
00:26:10,682 --> 00:26:12,618
Sensors reinitialized.

451
00:26:15,726 --> 00:26:17,696
The Jem'Hadar ship is gone.

452
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:18,857
Of course it is gone.

453
00:26:18,899 --> 00:26:21,427
You forgot to erase
the battle simulation program

454
00:26:21,471 --> 00:26:22,804
from the sensor display.

455
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:31,619
Stand down from Alert Status,
resume course.

456
00:26:31,661 --> 00:26:33,894
Reactivate cloak.

457
00:26:44,089 --> 00:26:45,991
Keep a close watch.

458
00:26:46,026 --> 00:26:47,689
There may be more

459
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:51,501
hostile simulation
programs out there.

460
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,280
Wait.

461
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,757
He'll never make
that mistake again.

462
00:27:01,794 --> 00:27:04,664
It's better that we
should be too ready

463
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,363
than not ready enough.

464
00:27:06,404 --> 00:27:09,001
At least you're
keeping us on our toes.

465
00:27:15,691 --> 00:27:19,153
You see, they have accepted him.

466
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:22,502
They have accepted him
as the ship's fool.

467
00:27:32,895 --> 00:27:36,734
In closing,
let me emphasize again

468
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:43,548
that Cardassia's gift of 15
industrial replicators to Bajor

469
00:27:43,586 --> 00:27:49,554
ushers in a new age
of cooperation and understanding

470
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:52,400
between our two peoples.

471
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:56,312
Hand in hand,
we'll march into a new era

472
00:27:56,347 --> 00:27:58,875
of peace and prosperity

473
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:00,980
as Dominion allies.

474
00:28:04,665 --> 00:28:06,464
Thank you, thank you,
that will be all.

475
00:28:08,908 --> 00:28:09,933
Ah, Major Kira

476
00:28:09,977 --> 00:28:13,439
may I have a word
with you, please?

477
00:28:14,454 --> 00:28:16,424
Have you heard?

478
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:18,622
The Cardassian Institute of Art

479
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:22,194
has decided to exhibit
three of Ziyal's drawings.

480
00:28:22,237 --> 00:28:23,797
Really?
Oh, that's wonderful.

481
00:28:23,841 --> 00:28:25,140
She must be excited.

482
00:28:25,177 --> 00:28:27,876
I'm hosting a celebration
for her in my quarters tonight.

483
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,214
I hope you'll join us.

484
00:28:29,253 --> 00:28:30,620
What time?

485
00:28:30,655 --> 00:28:32,682
Uh, 2130...

486
00:28:32,727 --> 00:28:35,700
unless I'm unavoidably delayed.

487
00:28:35,733 --> 00:28:38,466
Ah, the busy life
of an interstellar despot.

488
00:28:44,753 --> 00:28:46,416
This is a <i>kar'takin</i>

489
00:28:46,457 --> 00:28:49,396
a weapon favored
by the Jem'Hadar.

490
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,229
Defend yourself.

491
00:28:52,236 --> 00:28:55,266
No, that is not the proper grip.

492
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,941
The thumbs must be opposed,
so that twisting motions...

493
00:28:58,016 --> 00:28:59,006
I understand!

494
00:29:00,054 --> 00:29:01,489
Then proceed.

495
00:29:07,469 --> 00:29:10,772
No, do not try
to shove my blade away.

496
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,643
Deflect it and then use
your momentum to counter.

497
00:29:12,682 --> 00:29:14,083
I know!

498
00:29:14,117 --> 00:29:15,244
Then do it.

499
00:29:17,626 --> 00:29:20,793
No, do not try to fight
force with force.

500
00:29:20,832 --> 00:29:22,563
You will lose every time.

501
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,449
What did I tell you?

502
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:34,758
Well, pick it up!

503
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,067
If you had kept practicing

504
00:29:38,104 --> 00:29:40,097
what I taught you
when you were a boy

505
00:29:40,142 --> 00:29:42,477
this would be second nature
to you by now.

506
00:29:53,705 --> 00:29:55,140
What is wrong with you?

507
00:29:55,175 --> 00:29:57,305
I knew it would be like this.

508
00:29:57,346 --> 00:29:58,245
Like what?

509
00:29:58,281 --> 00:30:00,514
You must be pleased.

510
00:30:00,553 --> 00:30:01,817
Now you can tell me

511
00:30:01,856 --> 00:30:04,020
what a failure I am
as a Klingon.

512
00:30:04,127 --> 00:30:05,288
Alexander...

513
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:07,232
Or are you just going
to send me away again?

514
00:30:07,268 --> 00:30:09,466
We are not playing
in holosuites now.

515
00:30:09,506 --> 00:30:10,667
This is war.

516
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:13,180
The Jem'Hadar
will cut you to pieces.

517
00:30:13,214 --> 00:30:16,449
Then I will be dead...

518
00:30:16,488 --> 00:30:18,321
and you will be happy.

519
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,089
Now, leave me alone!

520
00:30:45,045 --> 00:30:46,537
Come in.

521
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,786
What do you want?

522
00:30:51,827 --> 00:30:53,022
From Gul Dukat.

523
00:30:53,063 --> 00:30:55,534
For some reason,
he thought you would enjoy

524
00:30:55,568 --> 00:30:57,128
having me deliver it to you.

525
00:30:57,172 --> 00:30:58,299
What is it?

526
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,969
A gift...

527
00:31:00,011 --> 00:31:01,503
for the party tonight.

528
00:31:26,904 --> 00:31:29,375
What the hell am I doing?

529
00:31:36,391 --> 00:31:37,359
Come in.

530
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:43,428
Ah, Major Kira,
what a pleasant surprise.

531
00:31:43,473 --> 00:31:44,942
Come in, come in.

532
00:31:49,453 --> 00:31:50,648
You don't like the dress?

533
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:52,785
The dress is fine.
I don't like you.

534
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,063
Major, that's just not true.

535
00:31:56,101 --> 00:31:58,197
There's a bond between us.

536
00:31:58,239 --> 00:31:59,538
No.

537
00:31:59,576 --> 00:32:01,375
Only in your mind.

538
00:32:01,413 --> 00:32:04,443
You are an opportunistic
power-hungry dictator

539
00:32:04,486 --> 00:32:07,117
and I want nothing more
to do with you.

540
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:12,433
Ziyal would be very disappointed
to hear you say that.

541
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,201
She'll get over it.

542
00:32:15,777 --> 00:32:17,770
Please, Nerys, let's sit down.

543
00:32:17,816 --> 00:32:19,410
We'll talk about it.

544
00:32:19,453 --> 00:32:20,682
No.

545
00:32:20,788 --> 00:32:22,621
We won't.

546
00:32:24,964 --> 00:32:26,297
Nerys.

547
00:32:26,334 --> 00:32:28,635
Nerys...

548
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:45,137
Who was that?

549
00:32:45,175 --> 00:32:47,202
A delivery.

550
00:32:48,784 --> 00:32:53,089
It's a little something for you
to wear to the party tonight.

551
00:32:57,469 --> 00:32:58,870
Do you like it?

552
00:32:58,906 --> 00:33:01,810
It's beautiful.

553
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:07,424
You can be so thoughtful.

554
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:09,793
I try.

555
00:33:27,668 --> 00:33:29,535
Continue.

556
00:33:52,023 --> 00:33:55,987
Hmm... fine blade,
well balanced.

557
00:33:56,031 --> 00:33:58,332
But in the end

558
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:03,335
it is only as good
as the warrior who wields it.

559
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,849
I need more practice.

560
00:34:06,888 --> 00:34:10,328
Tell me, Alexander Rozhenko...

561
00:34:10,362 --> 00:34:13,027
why are you on my ship?

562
00:34:13,069 --> 00:34:15,597
To serve the Empire, General.

563
00:34:15,641 --> 00:34:18,545
That is a slogan, not an answer.

564
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,573
Say what is in your heart.

565
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:23,250
Do you ask every new crewman
this question?

566
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:24,726
I have no need to.

567
00:34:24,761 --> 00:34:28,098
I look in their faces,
and I know why they are here.

568
00:34:28,135 --> 00:34:30,037
They are Klingon warriors.

569
00:34:30,072 --> 00:34:32,065
They have answered the call
of Kahless.

570
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,410
So have I.

571
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,779
Oh...

572
00:34:34,816 --> 00:34:37,846
lie to yourself, if you must,
but not to me.

573
00:34:37,957 --> 00:34:41,294
You do not hear
the warrior's call.

574
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:43,198
I ask again, why are you here?

575
00:34:44,972 --> 00:34:46,601
I'd rather not say.

576
00:34:46,642 --> 00:34:47,610
What?

577
00:34:47,644 --> 00:34:50,445
It's a private matter.

578
00:34:52,922 --> 00:34:55,553
You're as tightlipped
as your father.

579
00:34:55,596 --> 00:34:56,825
I am nothing like him.

580
00:34:56,864 --> 00:35:00,737
Both stubborn,
tiresome <i>qu'vatlh.</i>

581
00:35:00,773 --> 00:35:03,677
The only difference is
I need him.

582
00:35:03,713 --> 00:35:05,683
I do not need you.

583
00:35:05,718 --> 00:35:08,657
All I ask is a chance
to prove myself.

584
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,255
I just gave you one

585
00:35:12,299 --> 00:35:13,825
and you failed.

586
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:18,067
Your father has requested

587
00:35:18,112 --> 00:35:20,413
that you be transferred off
this ship.

588
00:35:20,449 --> 00:35:21,850
He has no right.

589
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:23,856
He has every right

590
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:28,333
both as your superior officer
and as your father.

591
00:35:29,937 --> 00:35:34,470
At 2317, you will transport
to the Cargo Vessel <i>Par'tok.</i>

592
00:35:34,514 --> 00:35:36,951
Collect your gear.

593
00:35:41,363 --> 00:35:42,832
Now.

594
00:35:59,723 --> 00:36:02,320
You are fortunate
that I am your father.

595
00:36:02,362 --> 00:36:05,529
If you had challenged
anyone else in that manner

596
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,437
you would be dead right now.

597
00:36:07,474 --> 00:36:08,943
If you want me off this ship

598
00:36:08,977 --> 00:36:10,674
you're going to have
to kill me.

599
00:36:12,251 --> 00:36:15,554
Alexander, I do not want
to hurt you.

600
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:17,186
I want to help you.

601
00:36:17,229 --> 00:36:18,630
By getting rid of me?

602
00:36:18,664 --> 00:36:21,534
All you've ever done
my whole life is send me away.

603
00:36:21,571 --> 00:36:23,131
I am a Klingon warrior.

604
00:36:23,175 --> 00:36:24,872
I lead a warrior's life.

605
00:36:24,912 --> 00:36:27,008
This is not the path for you.

606
00:36:27,049 --> 00:36:28,916
You told me this yourself.

607
00:36:28,954 --> 00:36:30,981
And I have come to accept it.

608
00:36:31,025 --> 00:36:32,358
You call yourself my father

609
00:36:32,462 --> 00:36:35,059
but you haven't tried to see me
or talk to me in five years.

610
00:36:35,101 --> 00:36:37,470
I wasn't
the kind of son you wanted

611
00:36:37,506 --> 00:36:40,307
so you pretended
that you had no son.

612
00:36:42,317 --> 00:36:44,652
You never accepted me.

613
00:36:46,325 --> 00:36:48,261
You abandoned me.

614
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,393
Battle stations!

615
00:36:51,437 --> 00:36:53,772
Alert Status 1.

616
00:37:09,877 --> 00:37:12,212
Aft Thruster Compartment
fire now contained.

617
00:37:12,249 --> 00:37:13,650
Shields at 60 percent.

618
00:37:13,685 --> 00:37:15,120
ELN and TRC off-line!

619
00:37:15,155 --> 00:37:16,488
And the Jem'Hadar?

620
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:17,720
Which one, sir?

621
00:37:17,761 --> 00:37:19,230
The one shooting at us!

622
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,364
His aft shields are down
to 25... no, 20 percent

623
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:29,409
and he's losing antiprotons
from his starboard nacelle.

624
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,819
Weapons, lock on that nacelle.
Fire at will.

625
00:37:30,857 --> 00:37:32,156
Full pattern.

626
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,026
We've lost target lock.

627
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,437
Switching to manual.

628
00:37:38,507 --> 00:37:42,038
Helm, bring us to 317 mark 045.

629
00:37:42,081 --> 00:37:43,106
Weapons, can you hit him?

630
00:37:43,151 --> 00:37:44,552
Negative, he's out of range.

631
00:37:44,586 --> 00:37:46,112
We've lost internal
communications.

632
00:37:46,157 --> 00:37:48,355
Come to course 020 mark 7...

633
00:37:48,395 --> 00:37:50,365
There's plasma venting
from the primary

634
00:37:50,399 --> 00:37:52,232
impulse injector on deck 5.

635
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,833
Subspace transceiver
array off-line.

636
00:37:54,876 --> 00:37:57,211
Worf, get that plasma leak
under control

637
00:37:57,247 --> 00:37:59,183
before we lose the entire deck.

638
00:38:03,595 --> 00:38:04,688
Status!

639
00:38:04,731 --> 00:38:06,200
Impulse injector temperature
approaching critical.

640
00:38:06,234 --> 00:38:07,794
Injector breach immanent.

641
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:09,102
I can seal the leak.

642
00:38:09,141 --> 00:38:11,339
Reinitializing
matrix sequencer.

643
00:38:11,379 --> 00:38:13,076
I'm of no use to you here.

644
00:38:14,819 --> 00:38:16,618
I will go with him.

645
00:38:16,657 --> 00:38:18,388
It will take
at least two of us

646
00:38:18,428 --> 00:38:20,729
to secure the injector
before it explodes.

647
00:38:23,806 --> 00:38:25,275
Go.

648
00:38:28,517 --> 00:38:29,644
Engineering, reroute

649
00:38:29,685 --> 00:38:31,279
all auxiliary power
to the disrupters.

650
00:38:31,322 --> 00:38:33,816
Disengage overload suppressor.

651
00:38:33,861 --> 00:38:35,160
Worf, put us off

652
00:38:35,198 --> 00:38:36,963
the Jem'Hadar's
starboard quarter.

653
00:38:37,002 --> 00:38:40,339
Weapons, continue to target
his damaged nacelle.

654
00:38:51,968 --> 00:38:53,767
Helm, on my command

655
00:38:53,805 --> 00:38:57,108
reduce impulse power
to one third.

656
00:38:57,146 --> 00:39:01,782
Bring us
to course 355 mark 090.

657
00:39:01,823 --> 00:39:03,018
Weapons...

658
00:39:03,059 --> 00:39:05,360
be ready for him
to pass in front of us.

659
00:39:05,397 --> 00:39:06,490
Course laid in.

660
00:39:06,567 --> 00:39:08,298
Weapons standing by.

661
00:39:08,338 --> 00:39:09,705
Now.

662
00:39:17,892 --> 00:39:19,191
Well done.

663
00:39:19,228 --> 00:39:22,167
Captain, permission
to leave the Bridge?

664
00:39:22,201 --> 00:39:23,260
Go.

665
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:26,707
Stand down from Alert Status.

666
00:39:26,745 --> 00:39:29,273
N'Garen, take the helm.

667
00:39:34,395 --> 00:39:35,522
Report.

668
00:39:35,564 --> 00:39:37,728
We sealed the impulse
injector, Commander.

669
00:39:39,071 --> 00:39:40,870
Where's my son?

670
00:39:40,909 --> 00:39:43,745
Trapped in that corridor, sir.

671
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:45,274
After we secured the injector

672
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:47,289
I sent him in there
to put the tools away

673
00:39:47,323 --> 00:39:51,196
and somehow, he tripped
the emergency lockdown.

674
00:39:51,231 --> 00:39:54,864
We are trying to override it
now.

675
00:40:03,459 --> 00:40:05,589
You locked yourself in?

676
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:10,269
Yes, sir.

677
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,459
Come.

678
00:40:42,521 --> 00:40:44,013
Nerys!

679
00:40:46,462 --> 00:40:48,956
You didn't come
to the party last night.

680
00:40:49,001 --> 00:40:49,969
I'm sorry.

681
00:40:50,003 --> 00:40:51,666
I couldn't.

682
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:54,202
I think you know why.

683
00:40:54,247 --> 00:40:57,186
Please don't ask me
to choose between you.

684
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,712
I'm not.

685
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:01,923
There's no choice...
he's your father.

686
00:41:17,632 --> 00:41:20,103
I cannot change the mistakes
I have made

687
00:41:20,137 --> 00:41:21,902
but from this day forward

688
00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:25,142
I promise I will stand with you.

689
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,983
We'll see if you mean it.

690
00:41:28,021 --> 00:41:30,014
Yes, we will.

691
00:41:30,058 --> 00:41:34,022
What you are about to do
entails a grave obligation.

692
00:41:34,067 --> 00:41:36,937
Do not accept it lightly.

693
00:41:36,974 --> 00:41:39,035
I understand

694
00:41:39,078 --> 00:41:41,413
and I accept.

695
00:41:41,483 --> 00:41:43,385
Good.

696
00:41:43,422 --> 00:41:44,390
I will teach you

697
00:41:44,424 --> 00:41:46,827
what you need to know
to be a warrior.

698
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:51,160
And you will teach me

699
00:41:51,205 --> 00:41:53,676
what I need to know
to be a father.

700
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:58,053
Come.

701
00:42:17,797 --> 00:42:20,428
<i>Martok degh, to-Duq degh</i>

702
00:42:20,503 --> 00:42:22,872
<i>bat-LEH degh, mat-LEH degh.</i>

703

711
00:43:50,032 --> 00:43:54,998
Welcome to the House of Martok,
Alexander...

712
00:43:55,043 --> 00:43:57,606
son of Worf.
