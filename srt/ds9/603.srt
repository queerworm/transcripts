1
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:13,889
(<i> beeping</i> )

2
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,432
Sisko to Dax.

3
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,356
Yes, Captain.

4
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:26,443
SISKO: We arrive at
Starbase 375 in five minutes.

5
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,153
I'll meet you in
the transporter room.

6
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,404
Dax out.

7
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,573
Ooh... now,
that's what I call

8
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,200
really bad timing.

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,118
I have to go.

10
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,257
Jadzia...

11
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,426
there is just
one more thing.

12
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,513
As long as it's not
about the wedding.

13
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:56,306
When we exchange
our vows,

14
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,933
you must remember

15
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:01,186
to present your<i> d'k tahg</i> 
to General Martok

16
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:04,690
as a formal request for him
to accept you into our House.

17
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,067
But I don't want
to join his House.

18
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,109
What?

19
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,820
I don't want
to get caught up

20
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,196
in all those blood feuds.

21
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,240
Every time a member
of the House of Martok

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,701
gets dishonored
or killed,

23
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,661
I'll have to drop
whatever I'm doing

24
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:20,205
and rush off on some quest
for vengeance.

25
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,999
It's boring, Worf.

26
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,752
If you refuse,
it will be a grave dishonor.

27
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:27,128
General Martok will
not understand--

28
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,463
Worf.

29
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,007
I'm joking.

30
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:36,805
So you<i> will</i> join
our House?

31
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:40,059
Of course I will.

32
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:43,228
I can see our lives together
will not be easy.

33
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,897
True.

34
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:46,523
But they'll be fun.

35
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,870
OFFICER:
Channel open.

36
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,790
This is General Martok
of the IKS<i> Rotarran</i>

37
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,917
requesting permission
to dock.

38
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,252
MAN:
General, you're cleared
for docking at Bay 11.

39
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,629
Thank God.

40
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,755
I never thought
I'd miss

41
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,172
Starfleet
field rations.

42
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,216
Give me some
freeze-dried peaches

43
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,635
or some
powdered carrots--

44
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,053
anything, as long
as it isn't moving.

45
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,721
It's not the food,
it's the singing.

46
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,389
Oh! Till all hours
of the night.

47
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,891
If I have to listen

48
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,225
to another ballad
about the honored dead

49
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,061
I'll go stark-raving mad.

50
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,981
MAN:
Captain Sisko, Admiral Ross

51
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:29,066
extends his compliments
for a job well done

52
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,234
and requests that you
and your senior staff

53
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,862
beam to his conference room
for debriefing immediately.

54
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,823
Tell the Admiral
we're on our way.

55
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:36,824
Starbase out.

56
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,117
Once again,

57
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:39,827
thank you for
rescuing us, General.

58
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:42,496
Hmm. Try not to get
too comfortable

59
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,748
lounging around
the starbase.

60
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,416
We need you back
in the fight.

61
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,418
Are you a betting
man, General?

62
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,088
One of my
many pleasures.

63
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,090
Then a barrel
of bloodwine says

64
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,301
I set foot on Deep
Space 9 before you do.

65
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,054
(<i> laughs</i> )

66
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,764
Done.

67
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,188
General, I just received word

68
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,441
the replacements
from the<i> Vor'nak</i> are here.

69
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,901
Good.

70
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,444
Look at this, Worf--

71
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,155
barely moving.

72
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:20,408
I'd give my good eye
for a plate of fresh<i> gagh.</i>

73
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,536
How many replacements?

74
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,704
Five.

75
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,081
Five?

76
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,167
I requested 15.

77
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:30,002
General Tanas
could only give us five.

78
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:31,879
(<i> sighs</i> )

79
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,297
We keep falling back.

80
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,926
The Dominion
keeps pushing forward.

81
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:41,555
I tell you, Worf,
war is much more fun

82
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,806
when you're winning!

83
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,308
Defeat makes
my wounds ache.

84
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,768
<i>pat'leH pum tliH-takk!</i>

85
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,062
Oh, the replacements.

86
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:57,946
(<i> sighs</i> )

87
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,823
I am General Martok.

88
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,743
Welcome to
the<i> Rotarran.</i>

89
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,452
May you prove worthy
of this ship

90
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,163
and bring honor to her name.

91
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:11,710
This is a glorious moment
in the history of the Empire

92
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,880
a chapter that will be written
with your blood.

93
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,633
Fight well, and our people
will sing your praises

94
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,344
for a thousand years.

95
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,930
Fail, and
there will be

96
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,225
no more songs,
no more honor

97
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,852
no more Empire.

98
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,939
Who among you hears the cry
of the warrior

99
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,315
calling you to glory?

100
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,984
ALL:
<i>Qapla'!</i>

101
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:40,697
Who offers their life
for the Empire?

102
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,074
N'Garen, daughter
of Tse'Dek!

103
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:45,452
Katogh,
son of Ch'Pok!

104
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,246
Koth,
son of Larna!

105
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:49,206
Doran, daughter
of W'Mar!

106
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,210
Alexander Rozhenko.

107
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,045
Alexander.

108
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:57,214
MARTOK:
Rozhenko?

109
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,967
Of what House
is Rozhenko?

110
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,886
Of no House, sir.

111
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,015
My honor will be my own.

112
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,683
Well...

113
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,060
there will be
plenty of honor

114
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,770
for the taking
on this ship--

115
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,605
enough for all of you.

116
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:16,566
I accept your lives
into my hands.

117
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,819
Glory to you,
and to the Empire!

118
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,156
<i>yih-Ghom-HAH!</i>

119
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,166
This Alexander
Rozhenko--

120
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,917
you know him?

121
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:39,256
He is my son.

122
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,220
KIRA (<i> quietly</i> ):
The next thing we need

123
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,972
is a secure way
to communicate

124
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,141
with our contacts
on Bajor.

125
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,934
Oh...

126
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,561
the Cardassians
are extremely adept

127
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,980
at locating the source

128
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,357
of any illicit
subspace transmission.

129
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,692
Well, we'll just have to
be smarter than they are.

130
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:05,777
(<i> sighs</i> )

131
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,070
Hi.

132
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,739
Mind if I join you?

133
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,199
(<i> chuckles</i> )

134
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,575
You already have.

135
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,162
I want in.

136
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,663
In on what?

137
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,292
Your resistance cell.

138
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:21,376
What cell?

139
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,419
Come on, Major

140
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,212
I have my sources.

141
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,755
How reassuring.

142
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,090
I can help.

143
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,300
How?

144
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,759
As a reporter

145
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,470
I hear things--
people talk to me.

146
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,846
About what?

147
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,724
Major, all I'm asking for
is a chance.

148
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,188
It's time, Major.

149
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,856
Oh...

150
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,024
already?

151
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,817
1457 hours.

152
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,944
The shuttle will be docking
in three minutes.

153
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,696
I better get going.

154
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,782
Don't want
to keep him waiting.

155
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,826
I see Gul Dukat's still
having you meet him

156
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,244
every time he returns
to the station.

157
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,874
Like I said, I hear things.

158
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,292
Um...

159
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:05,295
shouldn't you be wearing
your dress uniform?

160
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:10,591
You look lovely
just the way you are.

161
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,054
So am I in or not?

162
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:23,230
You... don't want to get
involved with this.

163
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,690
But... if you
are looking

164
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,526
for something to do

165
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:29,110
I could use
another waiter.

166
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,033
(<i> sighs</i> )

167
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,923
Ah, Major Kira!

168
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,092
So good
to see you again.

169
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,801
You're out of uniform, Major.

170
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,096
Bajorans could use
a lesson in respect.

171
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,556
Damar, please.

172
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:58,890
This is a
happy occasion.

173
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,768
Let's not spoil it.

174
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,728
I have a surprise for you.

175
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,275
Nerys!

176
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,776
Ziyal.

177
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,903
I am so glad
to see you.

178
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,071
What are you doing here?

179
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,906
You're supposed
to be on Bajor.

180
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:17,284
I talked her into taking
a little sabbatical

181
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,077
from the University.

182
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,079
<i>Talked</i> her into it?

183
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,914
It didn't take
much convincing.

184
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,541
Why don't you and I
have dinner tonight

185
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,833
and I'll tell you
all about it?

186
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:26,960
All right.

187
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,961
Splendid!

188
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,463
We'll dine in my quarters

189
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:30,547
at 2200 hours.

190
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,006
Wait a minute,
I didn't mean--

191
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,716
I can't tell you
how much I've missed you.

192
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,676
Come along, Ziyal.

193
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,220
I'll see you tonight.

194
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,307
All right.

195
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,153
WORF:
You sent for me,
General.

196
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,821
Orders at last.

197
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:58,074
We are to escort a convoy
to Donatu V.

198
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,784
The last three convoys
that were sent there

199
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,578
were destroyed
by the Jem'Hadar.

200
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,663
Which is why this one
must get through.

201
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,624
How many ships
will form the escort?

202
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,000
The<i> Rotarran</i> is all

203
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,085
the High Council
can spare.

204
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,296
A vital mission,
impossible odds

205
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,465
<i>and</i> a ruthless enemy.

206
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,800
What more
could we ask for?

207
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,512
I tell you, Worf,
I feel young again.

208
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,721
Here's the briefing.

209
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,723
Start battle drills
immediately.

210
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,560
Train them hard.

211
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,103
By the time we join the convoy

212
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,064
they will have the reflexes
of a Norpin falcon.

213
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,149
I expect nothing less.

214
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,570
Worf, one moment.

215
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,989
We have shed blood together

216
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,534
escaped from a Jem'Hadar prison
together.

217
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:43,203
You have pledged yourself
and your life to my House.

218
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,954
Yet in all this time

219
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,706
you have never once mentioned
that you had a son.

220
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:53,712
It is a... difficult subject
to discuss.

221
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:56,007
That much is obvious.

222
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,596
Alexander and I
were never close.

223
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:05,433
His mother was only half-Klingon
and was disdainful of our ways.

224
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,851
I see.

225
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,187
So you allowed her
to raise the boy.

226
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,605
No, General.

227
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,649
She was killed
when he was very young.

228
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,527
He spent a short time with me
aboard the<i> Enterprise</i>

229
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,237
but after that,
I sent him to live

230
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,279
with my foster
parents on Earth.

231
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,489
Why?

232
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,617
He showed...

233
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:25,786
no interest
in becoming a warrior.

234
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:28,122
It was difficult,
but I learned to accept it

235
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,333
and, in time,
encouraged him to find

236
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,834
his own path.

237
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,961
Then why has he joined
the Klingon defense forces?

238
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,547
I do not know.

239
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,382
I have not spoken with him.

240
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,760
This is not good, my friend.

241
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,846
When a father and son
do not speak

242
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,891
it means
there's trouble between them.

243
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:52,689
General, I prefer to handle this
my own way.

244
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,442
Then do so.

245
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,871
(<i> door beeps</i> )

246
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,081
Enter.

247
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,922
Bekk Alexander Rozhenko
reporting as ordered, sir.

248
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,258
You have grown.

249
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,010
So I've been told.

250
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,845
How are your grandparents?

251
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,222
Your parents were
in good health

252
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,307
when I last saw them.

253
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,976
Do they know you are here?

254
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,978
They weren't pleased
about my decision

255
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,522
but when they realized
I was determined to enlist

256
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,150
they supported me
as they always have.

257
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,612
I know we have not seen
each other for some time

258
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:41,988
but let us talk
as father and son.

259
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,574
I am not here to call you
"Father."

260
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,867
I am here to serve the Empire.

261
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,995
Serving the Empire was not
one of your priorities

262
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,246
when last we spoke.

263
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,832
As you say,
that was some time ago.

264
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,005
Did you think enlisting
would please me?

265
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,090
Pleasing you did not enter

266
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,759
into my decision.

267
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,721
With all due respect, sir

268
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,098
does this conversation
have any bearing

269
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,891
on my duties aboard this ship?

270
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,060
Stop pretending to be a warrior!

271
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,979
We both know
you do not belong here!

272
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,064
You heard
what I expect

273
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,650
from the rest of the crew.

274
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,026
Twice that, I expect from you.

275
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,695
Do we understand each other?

276
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,030
Perfectly.

277
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,949
You may go.

278
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,708
(<i> sighs</i> )

279
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:45,926
(<i> door chimes</i> )

280
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,094
Come in.

281
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:49,972
Nerys, you're early.

282
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,599
I've just started
the<i> ramufta.</i>

283
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,851
Ziyal...

284
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,269
I'm not having dinner
with you tonight.

285
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,356
Oh.

286
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,274
It's because of
my father, isn't it?

287
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,318
That's right.

288
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,571
I thought you might
change your mind.

289
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:07,365
I was hoping
I was wrong.

290
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:10,076
Ziyal, what are you doing
back on the station?

291
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,661
Please don't be
upset with me.

292
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,496
I know how hard
you worked

293
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,998
to arrange things
for me on Bajor.

294
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,751
I tried.
I<i> really</i> tried.

295
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,419
I'm not upset
with you.

296
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,045
I'm...

297
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,547
I'm a little confused.

298
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:23,715
What happened?

299
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,510
It wasn't
any one thing.

300
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,429
The students at
the University...

301
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,098
everybody was... polite.

302
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,601
But then I'd see
them whispering

303
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,394
in the hallways...

304
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,396
staring at me.

305
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:41,232
I'm the daughter
of Gul Dukat.

306
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,192
My father is
leading a war

307
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,985
against the Emissary
of the Prophets.

308
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,572
I don't know what made me think
I belonged there.

309
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:52,410
This station is the closest
thing I have to a home.

310
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,537
You're here.

311
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,372
My father is here.

312
00:15:56,372 --> 00:16:00,293
But the last time you defied
him, he left you here to die.

313
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,130
We talked about that.

314
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,673
He admits he overreacted.

315
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,508
But family loyalty
is important

316
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,719
to my father
and he felt I betrayed him.

317
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,471
<i>You</i> betrayed<i> him?</i>

318
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,807
I think
it's the other way around!

319
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,308
He misses me.

320
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,435
And I've missed him.

321
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:22,106
I have to give him a chance.

322
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,275
He's all I have, except for you.

323
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,027
I was hoping

324
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,739
you would have dinner
with us tonight because...

325
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,198
well, there's something special

326
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,826
I wanted to share
with both of you.

327
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,455
But I guess that's impossible.

328
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,166
Uh....

329
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,506
All right, I'll be here.

330
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,466
But I won't guarantee
it's going to be any fun.

331
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,053
I promise my father will behave.

332
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:22,500
(<i> laughing</i> )

333
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,381
(<i> clears throat</i> )

334
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,674
Is this seat taken?

335
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,425
Alexander Rozhenko.

336
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,554
We were holding it
just for you.

337
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,056
I am honored.

338
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,684
The honor is ours.

339
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,647
Please.

340
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,278
<i>Bregit</i> lung,
an excellent choice!

341
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,907
Would you care
for some<i> grapok</i> sauce?

342
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,700
Uh, no, thank you.

343
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,327
Oh, you must
try some.

344
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,372
It brings out
the flavor.

345
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:03,082
(<i> laughing</i> )

346
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,628
That's enough.

347
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,380
Thank you.

348
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,550
Some bloodwine
to wash it down?

349
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,011
(<i> laughing</i> )

350
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,345
Why are you laughing?

351
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:22,060
Or perhaps the son of our
illustrious First Officer

352
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,395
would prefer an Earth beverage.

353
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:28,357
A glass of root beer
with a lump of ice cream?

354
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,609
Mmm...

355
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,528
(<i> laughing</i> )

356
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,905
Are you mocking me?

357
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:38,284
Now why would I mock you,
son of Worf?

358
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,787
I am called Rozhenko.

359
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,666
I will call you
whatever I please.

360
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:50,296
And you will learn
to like it.

361
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,214
(<i> laughing</i> )

362
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,301
(<i> all laughing</i> )

363
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,054
Does the son of
Starfleet's finest

364
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,347
think he is too good
to eat with us?

365
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,643
No.

366
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,019
Have some lung!

367
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,446
I do not like
your smile!

368
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:19,199
Perhaps I will
cut you a new one.

369
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,708
(<i> laughing</i> )

370
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:46,811
(<i> laughing</i> )

371
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:54,110
He fights like a<i> Ferengi!</i>

372
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,402
(<i> all laughing</i> )

373
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:07,081
<i>Shakk-TAH!</i>

374
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,716
(<i> laughter</i> )

375
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,594
Your combat training
has been sadly neglected

376
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,930
little one.

377
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,141
I will teach you a new lesson...

378
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,434
one that you will
not soon forget!

379
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,104
Enough.

380
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:32,815
(<i> growls</i> )

381
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,281
You have no right to interfere!

382
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,618
You will both report

383
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,205
to the Medical Ward
immediately

384
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:48,539
and when they have finished
with you

385
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,582
you will remain in quarters

386
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,042
until your
next watch.

387
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,793
The rest of you,
back to your stations!

388
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,462
Now!

389
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,974
Are you going to fight

390
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:10,310
the Jem'Hadar
for him as well?

391
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:26,953
ZIYAL:
Vedek Nane taught me
to focus intently

392
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,913
on the image
that I want to evoke

393
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:31,040
to allow it to fully form
in my mind

394
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,084
before I even
pick up the brush.

395
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,088
Well, what do you think?

396
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:40,382
They're...
very good.

397
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,926
You think so?

398
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,052
They remind me

399
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,221
of Vedek Topek's
early work.

400
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,223
How ironic.

401
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:48,557
I was about to say

402
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:53,353
they're similar in style
to Napart Malor

403
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:56,190
the founder of the Valonnan
School on Cardassia.

404
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,484
The Director of the Cardassian
Institute of Art

405
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,568
said the same thing.

406
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,946
You spoke with the Director?

407
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:04,073
I sent him some of my drawings.

408
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,825
You should have told me, Ziyal.

409
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,577
I could have arranged
for you to meet him in person.

410
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,496
I know.

411
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:13,540
I wanted to do this on my own.

412
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,210
He said I have a real gift.

413
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,964
The Institute
is having

414
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:22,549
an exhibition of new artists
next month.

415
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,593
He might want
to include my work.

416
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,095
Wonderful!

417
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,429
It's a chance to show

418
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,598
that both Bajorans
and Cardassians

419
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,809
look at the universe
the same way.

420
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:34,394
And that's what I want to do
with my work--

421
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,604
bring people together.

422
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,113
I guess it sounds
a little silly.

423
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,615
On the contrary, my dear

424
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:50,161
you're quite eloquent.

425
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,290
Are you ready
for dessert?

426
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,958
Yes!

427
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,210
I'm not going
anywhere.

428
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,252
Good.

429
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,965
I don't believe
the change.

430
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,466
I have never
seen her so...

431
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,676
Happy?
Yeah.

432
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,094
Neither have I, Major.

433
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,889
I mean, she's finally
found something--

434
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,891
a talent,
a direction.

435
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,185
I'm reluctant to admit it

436
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:17,271
but you were right
to send her to Bajor.

437
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:20,440
I'm glad it worked out.

438
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,113
We seldom see
eye-to-eye, Major

439
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,615
but I know you care
about my daughter

440
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:31,202
and for that, I'm grateful.

441
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,133
There is only
one thing I hate

442
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,885
about convoy duty--

443
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,512
it's the waiting.

444
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,349
You'd think
after all these years

445
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:55,059
I'd be used to it.

446
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:59,479
But nothing breaks
the tension better

447
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,899
than a tankard
of<i> warnog.</i>

448
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:05,069
Except maybe
a good brawl.

449
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,572
You heard about the fight
in the mess hall.

450
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:12,410
Yes, but not from
my First Officer.

451
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,994
I lost him the moment

452
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,414
his son stepped
aboard this ship.

453
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,668
You think I acted improperly?

454
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:28,175
It is not an easy thing
to stand aside

455
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:31,845
and watch someone
injure your son.

456
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,806
Alexander was no match
for Ch'Targh.

457
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,224
He would have
killed the boy.

458
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:38,102
Ch'Targh might have
cut him a little

459
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:40,438
and maybe broken a few bones

460
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:42,315
but nothing more.

461
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:45,692
You told me Alexander
never wanted to be a warrior.

462
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:48,237
Clearly he has changed his mind.

463
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:52,032
Worf, you are his First Officer.

464
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,534
Teach him to survive.

465
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,370
The Jem'Hadar
will be less forgiving

466
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,164
than Ch'Targh.

467
00:24:58,164 --> 00:24:59,665
COM OFFICER:
Battle stations.

468
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,499
Alert Status 1.
Captain to the Bridge.

469
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,003
MARTOK:
Report!

470
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,380
ALEXANDER:
Jem'Hadar
attack ship

471
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,548
bearing 170 mark 045.

472
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:11,051
Estimated weapons range

473
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,303
in 22 seconds.

474
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:14,138
On screen.

475
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,058
Where is it?

476
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,602
I have no target on my sensors.

477
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,937
Switching to manual.

478
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,730
Reroute primary sensors
to weapons control.

479
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,399
Aye, sir.

480
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:26,817
(<i> console beeps</i> )

481
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,526
The Jem'Hadar has launched
two torpedoes.

482
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:29,736
At us or the convoy?

483
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,697
At us.

484
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,115
Impact in ten seconds.

485
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,451
Drop cloak, raise shields,
evasive action.

486
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:41,457
Torpedoes still locked on to us.

487
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:43,292
They will hit in four seconds.

488
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:44,418
Three...

489
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:45,336
Brace for impact.

490
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:46,420
ALEXANDER:
Two...

491
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,005
one...

492
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,484
Reinitialize primary sensors.

493
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,695
Sensors reinitialized.

494
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:16,909
The Jem'Hadar ship is gone.

495
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,452
Of course it is gone.

496
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,662
You forgot to erase
the battle simulation program

497
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,039
from the sensor display.

498
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,753
(<i> sighing</i> )

499
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:30,839
Stand down from Alert Status,
resume course.

500
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,133
Re-activate cloak.

501
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:45,187
Keep a close watch.

502
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,064
There may be more

503
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:50,692
hostile simulation
programs out there.

504
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,319
(<i> all laughing</i> )

505
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:57,408
Wait.

506
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,577
He'll never make
that mistake again.

507
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:02,204
It's better that we
should be too ready

508
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:05,458
than not ready enough.

509
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:08,210
At least you're
keeping us on our toes.

510
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,587
(<i> laughing</i> )

511
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,841
(<i> chuckling</i> )

512
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:18,178
You see, they have accepted him.

513
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:21,474
They have accepted him
as the ship's fool.

514
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:35,488
In closing,
let me emphasize again

515
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:37,406
that Cardassia's gift

516
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:42,328
of 15 industrial replicators
to Bajor

517
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:48,626
ushers in a new age
of cooperation and understanding

518
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:51,378
between our two peoples.

519
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:55,382
Hand in hand,
we'll march into a new era

520
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:58,093
of peace and prosperity

521
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,388
as Dominion allies.

522
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,557
(<i> applause</i> )

523
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,518
Thank you, thank you,
that will be all.

524
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,146
Ah, Major Kira

525
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:12,483
may I have a word
with you, please?

526
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,402
Have you heard?

527
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,988
The Cardassian
Institute of Art

528
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:21,033
has decided to exhibit
three of Ziyal's drawings.

529
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,409
Really?
Oh, that's wonderful.

530
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,077
She must be excited.

531
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:27,080
I'm hosting a celebration
for her in my quarters tonight.

532
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,207
I hope you'll join us.

533
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,833
What time?

534
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,835
Uh, 2130...

535
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,588
unless I'm
unavoidably delayed.

536
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:37,466
Ah, the busy life of
an interstellar despot.

537
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:38,842
(<i> laughing</i> )

538
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,724
This is a<i> kar'takin</i>

539
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,394
a weapon favored
by the Jem'Hadar.

540
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:50,103
Defend yourself.

541
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:54,233
No, that is not
the proper grip.

542
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,901
The thumbs
must be opposed

543
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:56,902
so that twisting motions...

544
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:57,986
I understand!

545
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,489
Then proceed.

546
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,662
(<i> grunting</i> )

547
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:09,623
No, do not try
to shove my blade away.

548
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:11,625
Deflect it and then use
your momentum to counter.

549
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:12,959
I know!

550
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,044
Then do it.

551
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,675
No, do not try to fight
force with force.

552
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,552
You will lose
every time.

553
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,557
(<i> grunting</i> )

554
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,227
What did I tell you?

555
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,731
Well, pick it up!

556
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:36,900
If you had kept
practicing

557
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,944
what I taught you
when you were a boy

558
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,196
this would be second nature
to you by now.

559
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,573
(<i> grunting</i> )

560
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:53,959
What is wrong with you?

561
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,211
I knew it would be
like this.

562
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,212
Like what?

563
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,381
You must be pleased.

564
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:00,633
Now you can tell me

565
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:03,009
what a failure I am
as a Klingon.

566
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,386
Alexander...

567
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,138
Or are you just going
to send me away again?

568
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,181
We are not playing
in holosuites now.

569
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,725
This is war.

570
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,060
The Jem'Hadar
will cut you to pieces.

571
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,522
Then I will be dead...

572
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,232
and you will be happy.

573
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,817
Now, leave me alone!

574
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:33,873

576
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,761
Come in.

577
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,016
What do you want?

578
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,351
From Gul Dukat.

579
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,894
For some reason,
he thought you would enjoy

580
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,271
having<i> me</i> deliver it to you.

581
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,690
What is it?

582
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,399
A gift...

583
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,900
for the party tonight.

584
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:28,721
What the hell am I doing?

585
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:36,687
Come in.

586
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,649
Ah, Major Kira

587
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,776
what a pleasant
surprise.

588
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,069
Come in, come in.

589
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,783
You don't like
the dress?

590
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:52,077
The dress is fine.
I don't like<i> you.</i>

591
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,119
(<i> sighs</i> )

592
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,080
Major, that's just not true.

593
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,415
There's a bond

594
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:57,416
between us.

595
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:58,792
No.

596
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,794
Only in your mind.

597
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:03,714
You are an opportunistic
power-hungry dictator

598
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:06,216
and I want nothing more
to do with you.

599
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:11,638
Ziyal would be very disappointed
to hear you say that.

600
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,306
She'll get over it.

601
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,018
Please, Nerys, let's sit down.

602
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,687
We'll talk about it.

603
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:19,979
No.

604
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,690
We won't.

605
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,569
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Nerys.

606
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:27,696
Nerys...

607
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,129
Who was that?

608
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,256
A delivery.

609
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:52,304
It's a little something for you
to wear to the party tonight.

610
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,059
Do you like it?

611
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,854
It's beautiful.

612
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:06,610
You can be so thoughtful.

613
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,821
I try.

614
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:15,034
(<i> grunting</i> )

615
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:28,757
Continue.

616
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:55,116
Hmm... fine blade,
well balanced.

617
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,577
But in the end

618
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:02,499
it is only as good
as the warrior who wields it.

619
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:03,792
I need
more practice.

620
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:09,255
Tell me, Alexander Rozhenko...

621
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,133
why are you on my ship?

622
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,761
To serve the Empire, General.

623
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,639
That is a slogan, not an answer.

624
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,599
Say what is in your heart.

625
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,352
Do you ask every new crewman
this question?

626
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:23,937
I have no need to.

627
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:27,190
I look in their faces,
and I know why they are here.

628
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,026
They are
Klingon warriors.

629
00:34:29,026 --> 00:34:31,110
They have answered the call
of Kahless.

630
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,445
So have I.

631
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,906
Oh...

632
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:36,909
lie to yourself, if you must,
but not to me.

633
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:40,328
You do not hear
the warrior's call.

634
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,121
I ask again, why are you here?

635
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,667
I'd rather not say.

636
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:46,626
What?

637
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,462
It's a private matter.

638
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,840
(<i> groans</i> )

639
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,593
You're as tightlipped
as your father.

640
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:55,928
I am nothing like him.

641
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:59,681
Both stubborn,
tiresome<i> qu'vatlh.</i>

642
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:02,642
The only difference is
I need him.

643
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,686
I do not need you.

644
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:07,689
All I ask is a chance
to prove myself.

645
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:11,150
I just gave you one

646
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,694
and you failed.

647
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,032
Your father has requested

648
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:19,451
that you be transferred off
this ship.

649
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:20,827
He has no right.

650
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,996
He has<i> every</i> right

651
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:28,126
both as your superior officer
and as your father.

652
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:33,298
At 2317, you will transport
to the Cargo Vessel<i> Par'tok.</i>

653
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,801
Collect your gear.

654
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,681
Now.

655
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:02,035
You are fortunate
that I am your father.

656
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:05,122
If you had challenged
anyone else in that manner

657
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:06,999
you would be dead right now.

658
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:08,583
If you want me off this ship

659
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,085
you're going to have
to kill me.

660
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:15,132
Alexander, I do not want
to hurt you.

661
00:36:15,132 --> 00:36:16,716
I want to help you.

662
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,301
By getting rid of me?

663
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:21,138
All you've ever done
my whole life is send me away.

664
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:22,681
I am a Klingon warrior.

665
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,641
I lead a warrior's life.

666
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,559
This is not the path for you.

667
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,269
You told me this yourself.

668
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,522
And I have come to accept it.

669
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,315
You call yourself my father

670
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,526
but you haven't tried to see me
or talk to me in five years.

671
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,945
I wasn't the
kind of son
you wanted

672
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:39,698
so you pretended
that you had no son.

673
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:44,036
You never accepted me.

674
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:47,831
You abandoned me.

The one shooting at us!

His aft shields are down
to 25... no, 20 percent

685

and he's losing antiprotons
from his starboard nacelle.

to secure the injector
before it explodes.

00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:21,400
Captain, permission
to leave the Bridge?

730
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,568
Go.

731
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,905
Stand down from Alert Status.

732
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:28,325
N'Garen, take the helm.

733
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,831
Report.

734
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:36,791
We sealed the impulse
injector, Commander.

735
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:40,045
Where's my son?

736
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:42,922
Trapped in
that corridor, sir.

737
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,590
After we secured the injector

738
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,467
I sent him in there
to put the tools away

739
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,845
and somehow,
he tripped

740
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,555
the emergency lockdown.

741
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,390
We are trying to override it

742
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,892
now.

743
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,647
(<i> coughing</i> )

744
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,819
You locked yourself in?

745
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:09,448
Yes, sir.

746
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,826
(<i> laughter</i> )

747
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,669
Come.

748
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,358
Nerys!

749
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,196
You didn't come
to the party last night.

750
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,447
I'm sorry.

751
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,116
I couldn't.

752
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:53,659
I think you know why.

753
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:56,704
Please don't ask me
to choose between you.

754
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,123
I'm not.

755
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:01,209
There's no choice--
he's your father.

756
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:19,518
I cannot change the mistakes
I have made

757
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,520
but from this day forward

758
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,607
I promise I will
stand with you.

759
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,444
We'll see if you mean it.

760
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:29,570
Yes, we will.

761
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:33,241
What you are about to do
entails a grave obligation.

762
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:36,369
Do not accept it lightly.

763
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,246
I understand

764
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,873
and I accept.

765
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,459
Good.

766
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:43,709
I will teach you

767
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,087
what you need to know
to be a warrior.

768
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:50,675
And you will teach me

769
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,927
what I need to know
to be a father.

770
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,265
Come.
