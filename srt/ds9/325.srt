1
00:00:02,698 --> 00:00:05,398
The Cardassians
are still closing.

2
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:08,502
They have powered
their weapon systems.

3
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:16,195
They have established
weapons lock.

4
00:00:22,412 --> 00:00:24,474
Weapons lock broken.

5
00:00:25,586 --> 00:00:26,714
Going to warp.

6
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:34,564
Get out of here, Jake!

7
00:00:34,607 --> 00:00:36,008
I'm-I'm in the middle
of a simulation!

8
00:00:37,047 --> 00:00:38,482
I said get out of here!

9
00:00:38,517 --> 00:00:41,980
Computer, end program.

10
00:00:42,026 --> 00:00:43,256
Oh! Oh, oh!

11
00:00:43,296 --> 00:00:44,264
You okay?

12
00:00:44,298 --> 00:00:46,428
Look what you made me do.

13
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,495
Well, you should know

14
00:00:47,538 --> 00:00:49,201
not to end a program
sitting down.

15
00:00:49,243 --> 00:00:50,644
Why did you come in here?

16
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,878
You were supposed to meet
me half an hour ago.

17
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:56,592
Well, I didn't realize
it had gotten so late.

18
00:00:56,627 --> 00:00:57,595
Sorry.

19
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,929
Don't worry about it.

20
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:00,401
How's it going, anyway?

21
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:03,102
Pretty good, I've improved
my reaction time

22
00:01:03,143 --> 00:01:04,407
by almost 20 percent

23
00:01:04,446 --> 00:01:06,975
but I've got to get it up
another five.

24
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:08,078
Is that the cutoff point

25
00:01:08,121 --> 00:01:10,183
for getting into the Academy
Preparatory Program?

26
00:01:10,226 --> 00:01:11,627
Exactly.

27
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,269
Don't worry about it, Nog.

28
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,395
You'll get there.

29
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,407
I'd better.

30
00:01:16,442 --> 00:01:18,709
Because if I don't
get into the program

31
00:01:18,747 --> 00:01:22,051
I'll never be admitted
into the Academy next year.

32
00:01:22,088 --> 00:01:24,389
You think six weeks
of summer classes

33
00:01:24,427 --> 00:01:25,896
will make the difference?

34
00:01:25,931 --> 00:01:27,025
If I do well.

35
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:29,061
I have to show
the admissions committee

36
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:31,907
how determined I am
to become a cadet.

37
00:01:31,946 --> 00:01:34,247
Don't worry so much, Nog.

38
00:01:34,284 --> 00:01:36,084
You'll be a great cadet.

39
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:40,827
In the meantime,
you make a lousy stock boy.

40
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:43,499
Why can't you take after
your friend here?

41
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,912
He knows enough
to stay out of Starfleet.

42
00:01:46,948 --> 00:01:49,010
Even a human can see

43
00:01:49,052 --> 00:01:51,114
there's a lot
more profitable opportunities

44
00:01:51,157 --> 00:01:53,721
out there for a young man
with ambition.

45
00:01:53,764 --> 00:01:56,099
Uncle, he wants to be a writer.

46
00:01:56,136 --> 00:01:58,107
There's no profit in that.

47
00:01:58,141 --> 00:02:02,915
On the contrary,
writing holosuite programs...

48
00:02:02,953 --> 00:02:04,947
especially the more
intimate variety...

49
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:07,292
is very profitable.

50
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,594
I'll bet.

51
00:02:08,633 --> 00:02:09,658
I'll tell you what.

52
00:02:09,702 --> 00:02:11,570
The two of you come up
with a proposal

53
00:02:11,607 --> 00:02:14,444
and I'll put up the latinum
for your first program.

54
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,044
I don't think so, Uncle.

55
00:02:19,058 --> 00:02:21,029
All right, fine...

56
00:02:21,063 --> 00:02:23,034
join Starfleet.

57
00:02:23,068 --> 00:02:25,130
I don't know why I bother
trying to help you anyway.

58
00:02:25,173 --> 00:02:26,973
Go down to the storeroom
and get your father.

59
00:02:27,011 --> 00:02:29,073
Tell him to get behind the bar.

60
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:31,952
Lieutenant Dax has asked me
to join the senior staff

61
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:34,483
for a very important
meeting in the wardroom.

62
00:02:39,707 --> 00:02:40,801
Do you have any idea

63
00:02:40,844 --> 00:02:42,747
what Dax wants
to talk to us about?

64
00:02:42,782 --> 00:02:43,944
No.

65
00:02:43,984 --> 00:02:46,148
Apparently, she asked
Leeta to come as well.

66
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:47,658
Hmm. I've noticed
they've been spending

67
00:02:47,693 --> 00:02:48,787
quite a bit of time together.

68
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:51,893
Do you keep tabs
on everybody, Constable?

69
00:02:51,936 --> 00:02:53,565
Not everyone.

70
00:02:53,608 --> 00:02:54,770
But really, Doctor

71
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,247
two Delvin fluff pastries
for breakfast this morning?

72
00:02:57,283 --> 00:02:58,877
You of all people
should know better

73
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,389
than to start
your day like that.

74
00:03:07,674 --> 00:03:09,109
Major. Chief.

75
00:03:09,144 --> 00:03:10,408
Hello, Leeta

76
00:03:10,448 --> 00:03:11,416
Oh, hello.

77
00:03:11,451 --> 00:03:12,977
And how are you doing?

78
00:03:15,059 --> 00:03:16,426
Thank you all for coming.

79
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:17,431
No problem.

80
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:18,455
What's up?

81
00:03:19,971 --> 00:03:22,637
I'll get right to the point.

82
00:03:22,677 --> 00:03:24,944
You are the seven people
on this station

83
00:03:24,983 --> 00:03:26,282
that I feel closest to

84
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,917
and I want you all to be
a part of my <i>zhian'tara.</i>

85
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,055
<i>Zhian'tara,</i> what's that?

86
00:03:31,097 --> 00:03:33,466
It's the Trill rite of closure.
I've read about it.

87
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:34,870
The <i>zhian'tara</i> is a ritual

88
00:03:34,906 --> 00:03:36,341
where joined Trills
get a chance

89
00:03:36,377 --> 00:03:38,108
to actually meet
their previous hosts.

90
00:03:38,148 --> 00:03:39,811
Meet them... how?

91
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:42,049
That's where you come in.

92
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,758
If you don't mind,
I'd like to borrow your bodies

93
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,030
for a few hours.

94
00:05:52,665 --> 00:05:54,829
What do you mean,
"borrow" our bodies?

95
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,169
Well, if you agree

96
00:05:56,207 --> 00:05:57,608
to participate

97
00:05:57,644 --> 00:05:59,581
the memories of one
of my previous hosts

98
00:05:59,615 --> 00:06:01,609
will be temporarily removed
from the symbiont

99
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:02,713
and imprinted onto you.

100
00:06:02,756 --> 00:06:04,521
You essentially become
one of my hosts

101
00:06:04,561 --> 00:06:06,532
for the duration of the ritual.

102
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:08,194
And how is this accomplished?

103
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:11,141
The memories are transferred
telepathically by a Guardian.

104
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:12,509
A Guardian?

105
00:06:12,546 --> 00:06:14,209
They take care of the symbionts.

106
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,483
Usually, they're unjoined Trill.

107
00:06:16,522 --> 00:06:19,586
Leeta is sort
of an amateur sociologist.

108
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,430
It comes in handy
in my line of work.

109
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:24,964
You never know who you'll meet
at the dabo table.

110
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:25,977
You're asking me

111
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:28,483
to hand my body over
to some dead person.

112
00:06:28,518 --> 00:06:30,546
Only for a few hours.

113
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:33,961
Uh-huh. What happens to me
in the meantime?

114
00:06:33,998 --> 00:06:35,763
You'll remain conscious

115
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:37,566
of everything
that's going on around you.

116
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:40,204
And at any time,
you can reassert yourself

117
00:06:40,246 --> 00:06:41,545
and regain control of your body.

118
00:06:41,582 --> 00:06:42,983
But it's best to relax

119
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:45,252
and let the host's
memories emerge.

120
00:06:45,292 --> 00:06:47,559
The point is to give
Jadzia a chance

121
00:06:47,597 --> 00:06:49,898
to interact
with her previous hosts.

122
00:06:49,936 --> 00:06:52,966
Curzon spoke very fondly
of his <i>zhian'tara.</i>

123
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:54,171
He said it was one

124
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:57,209
of the most powerful
experiences of his life.

125
00:06:57,253 --> 00:07:00,021
I do have one question.

126
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,256
What about Joran?

127
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:06,172
Joran... wasn't he
the, uh, crazy host of yours...

128
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,643
the musician who killed someone?

129
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:11,643
Uh, Commander Sisko has
volunteered to embody Joran.

130
00:07:11,688 --> 00:07:13,180
We've already discussed

131
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:16,357
taking certain precautions
during the transfer.

132
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:18,267
Well, count me in.

133
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:19,705
Me, too.

134
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:22,275
Yes.

135
00:07:22,313 --> 00:07:23,407
Agreed.

136
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:24,439
Chief?

137
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,353
Oh, yes, yeah, I'm in.

138
00:07:33,473 --> 00:07:35,307
Why is everybody looking at me?

139
00:07:35,345 --> 00:07:39,150
Because you're the only one who
hasn't agreed to participate.

140
00:07:41,626 --> 00:07:44,565
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

141
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,972
You're going to have
to find someone else.

142
00:07:48,008 --> 00:07:51,540
I really want you to be
a part of this, Quark.

143
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:55,685
I was hoping that you
would embody Audrid for me.

144
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:57,891
Well...

145
00:07:57,932 --> 00:08:01,168
I think it will make us closer.

146
00:08:01,207 --> 00:08:05,012
Uh... when you put it
that way...

147
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:07,543
I knew I could count on you.

148
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:13,001
Kira, I would like you
to embody Lela, my first host.

149
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,440
We'll start tomorrow
after the Guardian arrives.

150
00:08:16,476 --> 00:08:17,809
It means a lot to me

151
00:08:17,846 --> 00:08:20,444
that all of you are
willing to do this.

152
00:08:20,486 --> 00:08:22,616
Thank you.

153
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:33,614
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but did Quark just agree

154
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:35,588
to embody one
of your female hosts?

155
00:08:35,622 --> 00:08:37,525
Yes, he did.

156
00:08:37,561 --> 00:08:39,429
Hmm.

157
00:08:45,145 --> 00:08:48,483
After that, comes the deductive
reasoning portion of the exam

158
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,718
and then the spatial
orientation test.

159
00:08:50,758 --> 00:08:52,558
The whole thing should
take about four days.

160
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:56,197
Now, I know it must sound
overwhelming to you.

161
00:08:56,305 --> 00:08:58,538
Just try to take it
one day at a time.

162
00:08:58,577 --> 00:09:02,143
One day at a time, right.

163
00:09:02,219 --> 00:09:04,349
And today, all you
have to worry about

164
00:09:04,391 --> 00:09:06,419
is the stress reaction test.

165
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:09,197
Computer, run program delta 59.

166
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,872
I-I thought this was going
to be a runabout simulation.

167
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:15,885
No.

168
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:18,517
But... that's what I practiced.

169
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,826
Well, if we tested you
where you practiced

170
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:23,496
it wouldn't exactly be
stressful, now would it?

171
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:25,838
Man your post.

172
00:09:25,876 --> 00:09:27,847
You're the Operations
Officer on duty.

173
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:39,832
What was that?!

174
00:09:41,246 --> 00:09:42,408
You tell me.

175
00:09:51,304 --> 00:09:54,038
We've been trying to get Dax
back to the homeworld

176
00:09:54,077 --> 00:09:56,548
to perform the <i>zhian'tara</i>
for some time now.

177
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:59,750
She kept putting us off,
so the Symbiosis Commission

178
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:03,129
decided to force the issue
and send me here.

179
00:10:03,165 --> 00:10:05,295
I just haven't had time
to get away.

180
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:06,737
You could have made the time.

181
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:09,268
Where is the <i>zhian'tara</i>
to take place?

182
00:10:09,313 --> 00:10:11,147
I have preparations
to make.

183
00:10:11,184 --> 00:10:12,346
This way.

184
00:10:19,137 --> 00:10:21,769
<i>I'nora, ja'kala Dax...</i>

185
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:25,011
<i>zhian'shee, Lela tanus rem.</i>

186
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:28,115
<i>Gon'dar, Jadzia tor.</i>

187
00:10:28,158 --> 00:10:31,188
<i>Jadzia, zhian'tara vok.</i>

188
00:10:31,232 --> 00:10:34,205
<i>Tu Dax, zhian'tani ress.</i>

189
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,480
<i>Zhian'par, Lela garu'koj...</i>

190
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:05,374
Kira?

191
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,478
No...

192
00:11:08,522 --> 00:11:10,253
Lela.

193
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:17,800
You must be Dax's new host.

194
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:18,973
I'm Jadzia.

195
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:22,077
Oh, what a beautiful name.

196
00:11:22,121 --> 00:11:24,422
I have a few questions
for both of you.

197
00:11:24,527 --> 00:11:25,689
I need to make sure

198
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,997
the memory transference
is complete.

199
00:11:28,035 --> 00:11:29,265
Go ahead.

200
00:11:29,305 --> 00:11:31,640
What is the last thing
you remember?

201
00:11:31,677 --> 00:11:34,844
Talking to Curzon
at his <i>zhian'tara.</i>

202
00:11:34,885 --> 00:11:38,121
Can you tell me
the name of the person

203
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,793
who supervised Lela
when she was an initiate?

204
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,999
No, I can't remember.

205
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,634
Well, that's perfectly
all right.

206
00:11:45,678 --> 00:11:47,170
It just means Lela's memories

207
00:11:47,215 --> 00:11:49,482
have been temporarily
removed from your mind.

208
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,457
It's a little disorienting

209
00:11:51,492 --> 00:11:53,121
like part of me
is suddenly missing.

210
00:11:53,162 --> 00:11:54,859
Not missing...

211
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,029
right here...

212
00:11:57,071 --> 00:12:01,947
and the name of my initiate
supervisor was Jobel.

213
00:12:01,983 --> 00:12:06,153
Excellent, the transference
seems to be complete.

214
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:09,291
Unless either of you
have any questions

215
00:12:09,335 --> 00:12:11,329
I'll leave you alone
for a few hours.

216
00:12:11,372 --> 00:12:12,705
Thank you.

217
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:23,298
Such odd fellows
these Guardians are.

218
00:12:23,334 --> 00:12:25,134
I know.

219
00:12:25,172 --> 00:12:29,171
Well, it's understandable,
I suppose.

220
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,881
They spend most
of their time underground

221
00:12:31,921 --> 00:12:34,758
tending symbiont pools
full of this stuff.

222
00:12:37,903 --> 00:12:40,067
Ah, I love the smell of it.

223
00:12:40,108 --> 00:12:42,251
Don't you?

224
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:53,399
It looks like you've ended up
a long way from home, Jadzia.

225
00:12:57,019 --> 00:12:59,183
What is it?

226
00:12:59,224 --> 00:13:03,860
It's just, uh... I hold
my hands behind my back...

227
00:13:03,902 --> 00:13:05,531
the same way you do.

228
00:13:05,573 --> 00:13:11,213
Ah, it's a habit I picked up
when I was a legislator.

229
00:13:11,253 --> 00:13:15,628
I was one of the first women
to serve as a council member.

230
00:13:15,663 --> 00:13:19,833
When I started out,
I talked with my hands a lot

231
00:13:19,874 --> 00:13:21,845
lots of emphatic gesturing.

232
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,473
I discovered

233
00:13:23,516 --> 00:13:26,786
some of my male colleagues
were imitating me

234
00:13:26,824 --> 00:13:29,456
so I started to do this.

235
00:13:29,497 --> 00:13:31,968
I just thought it was
an unconscious habit.

236
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:34,065
I never realized why I did it.

237
00:13:34,108 --> 00:13:38,483
Ah, that's the point
of a <i>zhian'tara...</i>

238
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:43,553
to discover these things
about yourself.

239
00:13:43,597 --> 00:13:46,126
It's so strange.

240
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,972
It's like you really are Lela.

241
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,913
Well, in a sense, I am.

242
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:56,155
After all, what is a person
but a sum of their memories?

243
00:13:56,194 --> 00:13:59,395
Oh...

244
00:13:59,503 --> 00:14:03,639
I have a feeling that
these next few days

245
00:14:03,678 --> 00:14:08,144
are going to be
extraordinary for you.

246
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:20,680
Tobin, I don't think
Chief O'Brien

247
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:23,624
is going to appreciate
you biting his nails.

248
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,656
Sorry.

249
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:28,729
I guess I'm a little nervous.

250
00:14:29,942 --> 00:14:30,910
That's all right.

251
00:14:30,945 --> 00:14:32,779
I get that way sometimes myself.

252
00:14:32,815 --> 00:14:36,016
And now you know
who you have to thank for it.

253
00:14:36,057 --> 00:14:37,549
Sorry.

254
00:14:37,594 --> 00:14:39,963
Will you please stop
saying you're sorry?

255
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:41,195
Sorry.

256
00:14:41,235 --> 00:14:44,732
I've been working on
finishing your proof

257
00:14:44,777 --> 00:14:46,873
of Fermat's Last Theorem.

258
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,819
You have?!

259
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:52,887
It's the most original
approach to the proof...

260
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,732
since Wiles, over 300 years ago.

261
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,864
Thanks.

262
00:14:56,906 --> 00:15:00,073
I guess I tend to look
for original approaches myself.

263
00:15:00,114 --> 00:15:02,951
I guess I have you
to thank for that as well.

264
00:15:09,937 --> 00:15:11,429
Very nice.

265
00:15:11,508 --> 00:15:13,741
This is an excellent body
you managed to get for me.

266
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:15,684
I'll be sure
to pass that along.

267
00:15:15,718 --> 00:15:18,623
I remember when I first
got the Dax symbiont

268
00:15:18,658 --> 00:15:19,888
I was worried that it might

269
00:15:19,928 --> 00:15:21,454
affect my coordination
in some way.

270
00:15:21,565 --> 00:15:23,125
And hurt your gymnastics career.

271
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,195
As it turned out

272
00:15:24,238 --> 00:15:26,607
being joined
improved my concentration.

273
00:15:26,644 --> 00:15:30,085
Really?
I found that as well.

274
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:31,452
You're a gymnast?

275
00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:34,587
No, but I'm an expert
in Klingon martial arts.

276
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,156
Oh.

277
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,500
Did you take it up

278
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:40,374
before or after
you were joined?

279
00:15:40,411 --> 00:15:41,937
After.

280
00:15:45,222 --> 00:15:47,489
Why am I not surprised?

281
00:15:51,604 --> 00:15:55,306
Sit right here, and I'll
tell you all about it.

282
00:15:58,086 --> 00:16:01,082
The day I was named head
of the Symbiosis Commission

283
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,827
was one of the happiest
of my life.

284
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:07,501
Right behind the day I gave
birth to my first child.

285
00:16:10,215 --> 00:16:11,844
Are you a mother, Jadzia?

286
00:16:11,886 --> 00:16:13,253
No.

287
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:16,856
Oh... I hope you
will be someday.

288
00:16:16,898 --> 00:16:21,808
There's nothing quite like
holding a baby to your breast

289
00:16:21,844 --> 00:16:23,313
nursing it...

290
00:16:26,421 --> 00:16:31,992
The entity that lent me
this body wishes to speak.

291
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:37,580
How much longer am I going
to have to do this?

292
00:16:37,681 --> 00:16:39,709
Another hour at most.

293
00:16:39,753 --> 00:16:41,815
And the sooner
we get back to it

294
00:16:41,858 --> 00:16:43,384
the sooner it'll be over.

295
00:16:43,428 --> 00:16:47,427
Just remember, not a word
about this to anyone.

296
00:16:47,471 --> 00:16:50,103
I promise.

297
00:16:54,656 --> 00:16:57,093
Maybe you should go easy
on those, Torias.

298
00:16:57,128 --> 00:16:58,563
Julian was just telling me
the other day

299
00:16:58,598 --> 00:16:59,862
he's started
to watch what he eats.

300
00:16:59,901 --> 00:17:02,465
Well, you should tell
your friend to live a little.

301
00:17:02,508 --> 00:17:03,476
Life's too short

302
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,039
to deprive yourself
of the simple pleasures.

303
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,484
I should know.

304
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,584
You didn't exactly
deprive yourself.

305
00:17:10,627 --> 00:17:13,498
No, but my life was too short.

306
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:15,299
The accident.

307
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:17,275
Still, I'm lucky.

308
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:21,080
I continue to exist,
as part of you

309
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,919
just as Jadzia
will go on existing

310
00:17:22,956 --> 00:17:25,393
when the symbiont
is passed on to a new host.

311
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:27,923
We're part of something
bigger than any one of us.

312
00:17:27,968 --> 00:17:30,941
I just feel lucky
to have been chosen.

313
00:17:30,975 --> 00:17:32,969
So do I.

314
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:36,213
Come in.

315
00:17:39,864 --> 00:17:41,493
It's late.

316
00:17:41,534 --> 00:17:45,499
I think it's time we returned
Dr. Bashir's body to him.

317
00:17:47,548 --> 00:17:49,815
It was nice meeting you.

318
00:17:58,508 --> 00:17:59,636
I'm ready.

319
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:03,242
Are you sure about this,
Commander?

320
00:18:03,286 --> 00:18:04,585
Don't worry, Odo.

321
00:18:04,622 --> 00:18:06,820
Joran isn't going to be able
to hurt anyone

322
00:18:06,861 --> 00:18:08,455
from inside of a holding cell.

323
00:18:08,499 --> 00:18:10,527
There's just one problem.

324
00:18:10,571 --> 00:18:12,838
You're going to be
in there with him.

325
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:13,935
Hmm.

326
00:18:26,308 --> 00:18:28,472
Activate the force field.

327
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:52,629
Joran.

328
00:18:52,672 --> 00:18:55,908
Hello, Jadzia.

329
00:19:04,266 --> 00:19:07,502
If you need me,
I'll be right outside.

330
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,066
As will I.

331
00:19:14,992 --> 00:19:18,262
It's good to see you again,
Jadzia.

332
00:19:26,953 --> 00:19:31,259
Tell me, have you been
practicing your music?

333
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:34,237
Yes, when I have the time.

334
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,469
Good.

335
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,777
Do you think of me
when you play?

336
00:19:40,687 --> 00:19:41,380
Sometimes.

337
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,714
I'm glad.

338
00:19:44,754 --> 00:19:50,598
You're a very pretty girl,
Jadzia.

339
00:19:50,635 --> 00:19:52,833
Very pretty.

340
00:19:54,912 --> 00:19:59,754
But unfortunately,
that's all you are.

341
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,193
You're nothing

342
00:20:02,263 --> 00:20:05,202
compared to Lela, Torias

343
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,903
or myself.

344
00:20:08,912 --> 00:20:11,383
You're a pretender.

345
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:14,619
You must realize that by now.

346
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:17,028
You don't know
anything about me.

347
00:20:17,065 --> 00:20:20,163
Only what I can see.

348
00:20:20,206 --> 00:20:23,338
A little girl, not worthy

349
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,478
of the noble creature
nestled inside her.

350
00:20:26,521 --> 00:20:29,927
You're overwhelmed by it.

351
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:32,230
You're in over your head.

352
00:20:34,307 --> 00:20:38,773
And they said it was a mistake
choosing me for joining.

353
00:20:42,726 --> 00:20:47,135
But there is one hope
for you, Jadzia

354
00:20:47,171 --> 00:20:50,269
and that's me.

355
00:20:50,311 --> 00:20:53,774
My strength is within you.

356
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,625
You don't have
to be afraid of it.

357
00:20:57,662 --> 00:20:59,690
I'm not.

358
00:20:59,734 --> 00:21:04,200
Then let me show you
how to use it.

359
00:21:04,244 --> 00:21:08,414
Lower the force field, Jadzia.

360
00:21:08,454 --> 00:21:11,291
Lower it...

361
00:21:11,328 --> 00:21:17,435
and you will never have to be
afraid of anything ever again.

362
00:21:19,147 --> 00:21:20,639
No.

363
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,035
Joran!

364
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,806
Stop it.
You're hurting him!

365
00:21:32,846 --> 00:21:34,509
Benjamin, take control!

366
00:21:37,858 --> 00:21:40,956
I think that's enough
of Joran for now.

367
00:21:47,215 --> 00:21:48,445
Are you all right?

368
00:21:53,596 --> 00:21:55,031
Surprise.

369
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:13,502
It's all right, old man.

370
00:22:13,544 --> 00:22:14,638
It's me.

371
00:22:19,157 --> 00:22:20,387
Whoo!

372
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,450
Thanks.

373
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:24,659
For what?

374
00:22:24,704 --> 00:22:28,475
For not breaking any bones.

375
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,660
Dabo!

376
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:02,861
Will you stop doing that?

377
00:23:02,895 --> 00:23:04,125
It's very distracting.

378
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:07,332
I'm trying to do the books.

379
00:23:07,373 --> 00:23:08,774
I can't help it.

380
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:10,974
My son's future is being decided
at this very minute.

381
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:14,113
Well, pacing around
like some Alvanian cave sloth

382
00:23:14,156 --> 00:23:15,750
isn't going to help him.

383
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:30,783
What's that?

384
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,599
Uh... a cadet's uniform.

385
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,802
I got it for Nog.

386
00:23:36,844 --> 00:23:40,843
I had Garak make it to order.

387
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:43,187
It cost five strips of latinum.

388
00:23:43,226 --> 00:23:44,354
Well, you wasted
your money.

389
00:23:44,395 --> 00:23:45,762
He's not going to need it.

390
00:23:45,798 --> 00:23:47,097
Why not?

391
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,510
Because...
he'll be issued a uniform

392
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,044
if and when he gets
to the Academy.

393
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:59,029
Well, now he'll have two.

394
00:24:01,703 --> 00:24:03,697
I keep thinking about Joran.

395
00:24:03,741 --> 00:24:05,370
I heard what he told you.

396
00:24:05,412 --> 00:24:07,815
I can't seem to get
it out of my head.

397
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:11,850
Jadzia, did you put off
having your <i>zhian'tara</i>

398
00:24:11,894 --> 00:24:14,423
because you were afraid
you wouldn't measure up

399
00:24:14,467 --> 00:24:15,526
to the other hosts?

400
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,837
I don't know, maybe I did.

401
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,367
Now that it's almost over

402
00:24:19,412 --> 00:24:21,440
I hope you realize
you were wrong.

403
00:24:21,484 --> 00:24:23,978
I'm not so sure I was.

404
00:24:24,023 --> 00:24:26,085
I don't understand
how you could say that.

405
00:24:26,129 --> 00:24:28,897
You were chosen for joining
because you deserved it

406
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:30,803
just as much
as any of the others.

407
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:32,810
If that's true,
then why did Curzon

408
00:24:32,844 --> 00:24:34,838
wash me
out of the initiate program?

409
00:24:34,883 --> 00:24:36,512
You tell me.

410
00:24:38,424 --> 00:24:39,414
I've always believed

411
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,454
it was because he
wanted to challenge me

412
00:24:41,498 --> 00:24:44,027
so that I would reapply
and try harder.

413
00:24:44,071 --> 00:24:46,372
Now I'm not so sure.

414
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:47,845
Why not?

415
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,874
That's exactly what you did.

416
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,416
Maybe Curzon just didn't
think I was good enough.

417
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,624
I find that hard to believe.

418
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:57,830
But if that's
what you're afraid of

419
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:01,243
why don't you ask him
when you see him?

420
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,808
I will...

421
00:25:03,851 --> 00:25:07,622
but what if he tells me
something I don't want to hear?

422
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:14,433
I have to go.

423
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:24,933
<i>Jadzia, zhian'tara vok.</i>

424
00:25:24,969 --> 00:25:27,202
<i>Tu Dax, zhian'tani ress.</i>

425
00:25:27,241 --> 00:25:30,373
<i>Zhian'par, Odo garu'koj...</i>

426
00:25:59,585 --> 00:26:01,749
I'm going to my office
for a while.

427
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,298
Benjamin!

428
00:26:06,335 --> 00:26:08,670
You do recognize me,
don't you?

429
00:26:08,741 --> 00:26:10,301
Curzon?

430
00:26:10,344 --> 00:26:14,183
Don't tell me,
the nose gave me away, huh?

431
00:26:15,223 --> 00:26:16,213
What's the matter?

432
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:17,785
Aren't you happy to see me?

433
00:26:17,829 --> 00:26:21,292
Of course.
Of course.

434
00:26:23,075 --> 00:26:24,237
So, where's Jadzia?

435
00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:25,246
Ah, it's all right.

436
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,510
I told her I wanted
to come see you.

437
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,712
That we'd meet up later
at Quark's.

438
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:29,951
I'm going to give
that little toad

439
00:26:29,992 --> 00:26:31,461
the scare of his life.

440
00:26:31,495 --> 00:26:33,363
You sound like Odo.

441
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,994
I am Odo.

442
00:26:35,037 --> 00:26:36,472
I don't understand.

443
00:26:36,507 --> 00:26:38,410
I thought you were Curzon.

444
00:26:38,446 --> 00:26:39,676
I'm both.

445
00:26:39,714 --> 00:26:42,744
The, uh, Guardian thinks
it has something to do

446
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:45,056
with my shape-shifting
nature.

447
00:26:45,094 --> 00:26:48,933
It's as if Odo and Curzon
have been joined.

448
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,168
It's proven to be quite
an interesting experience

449
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,543
for both of us.

450
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:56,247
In any case, the Guardian says
it's nothing to worry about.

451
00:26:56,288 --> 00:26:58,316
I like the beard, by the way.

452
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,659
Yeah?

453
00:26:59,696 --> 00:27:00,995
Absolutely.

454
00:27:01,032 --> 00:27:05,999
So... when is Kasidy Yates
coming back, huh?

455
00:27:06,044 --> 00:27:07,012
Huh?

456
00:27:07,047 --> 00:27:08,539
Not you, too.

457
00:27:08,584 --> 00:27:09,129
Well, she's a fine-looking
woman, Ben.

458
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:10,062
Well, she's a fine-looking
woman, Ben.

459
00:27:10,164 --> 00:27:13,001
Reminds me of the girl
you took up with on Pelios...

460
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:14,598
Why don't we join
Jadzia in Quark's?

461
00:27:14,641 --> 00:27:16,737
And let Jake
finish his homework.

462
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,443
I'll tell you
all about it later.

463
00:27:18,484 --> 00:27:19,452
Okay.

464
00:27:19,486 --> 00:27:21,149
Curzon, remember?

465
00:27:34,054 --> 00:27:35,717
Quark!

466
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,560
Odo?

467
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,838
What happened to your face?

468
00:27:43,878 --> 00:27:45,746
Never mind my face.

469
00:27:47,921 --> 00:27:49,390
Did I ever mention

470
00:27:49,425 --> 00:27:51,453
you're a magnificent
scoundrel?

471
00:27:51,497 --> 00:27:53,297
Two <i>tranyas</i> please,
very cold.

472
00:27:54,537 --> 00:27:55,596
Right away.

473
00:28:01,454 --> 00:28:02,980
It's going to take Quark

474
00:28:03,024 --> 00:28:05,052
a little while
to get over that.

475
00:28:05,096 --> 00:28:06,656
Jadzia.

476
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,898
It looks like the two of you
are having a good time.

477
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,909
Well, as good a time as
two gentlemen can have

478
00:28:10,943 --> 00:28:12,880
without the company of a lady.

479
00:28:12,915 --> 00:28:14,043
Please, join us.

480
00:28:16,957 --> 00:28:20,990
Excuse me while I slip into
something more appropriate.

481
00:28:24,007 --> 00:28:25,101
Ah!

482
00:28:26,146 --> 00:28:27,911
I love being a changeling.

483
00:28:27,951 --> 00:28:29,443
Well, if you two

484
00:28:29,488 --> 00:28:31,721
don't mind,
I think I'll be pushing off.

485
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,286
Benjamin, don't go.

486
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,665
I have to finish evaluating
Nog's test results.

487
00:28:35,703 --> 00:28:37,297
He's waiting
to hear how he did.

488
00:28:39,578 --> 00:28:41,947
Thanks for stopping by,
old man.

489
00:28:41,984 --> 00:28:43,681
It was good to see you.

490
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:44,747
Oh!

491
00:28:47,564 --> 00:28:52,599
Well, there goes
the best friend I ever had.

492
00:28:52,643 --> 00:28:54,010
Well?

493
00:29:01,063 --> 00:29:04,469
So... are you enjoying
your <i>zhian'tara?</i>

494
00:29:04,505 --> 00:29:06,476
For the most part.

495
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:10,417
What about that Tobin, huh?

496
00:29:10,452 --> 00:29:13,516
Did he tell you that I got him
drunk for the first time

497
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,756
during my <i>zhian'tara?</i>

498
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:16,129
No.

499
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:18,364
But I can see why you did.

500
00:29:22,883 --> 00:29:25,252
Curzon, there's something
I want to talk to you about.

501
00:29:25,321 --> 00:29:26,915
Oh?

502
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:28,689
Do you remember when
I was an initiate?

503
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:32,672
Do you see
that Ferengi over there?

504
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:35,176
A bulletin came in
on him last week.

505
00:29:35,212 --> 00:29:37,410
He's a <i>tongo</i> hustler.

506
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,421
I'd love to clean him out.

507
00:29:39,455 --> 00:29:41,426
We should get a game going.

508
00:29:52,753 --> 00:29:53,983
<i>Tongo!</i>

509
00:29:58,768 --> 00:30:02,539
I just don't understand
how I could have failed, Father.

510
00:30:02,577 --> 00:30:05,345
You've always been so good
with spatial orientation.

511
00:30:05,384 --> 00:30:07,878
Remember the time
we redid the floors

512
00:30:07,924 --> 00:30:10,157
and you managed
to stack all the chairs

513
00:30:10,196 --> 00:30:11,996
so they fit behind the bar?

514
00:30:12,033 --> 00:30:16,567
Now I won't qualify to take
the Academy Entrance Exam.

515
00:30:16,611 --> 00:30:20,177
My Starfleet career is over
before it even started.

516
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,780
He's right, you know.

517
00:30:21,823 --> 00:30:23,156
And it's not fair.

518
00:30:23,193 --> 00:30:26,394
Starfleet has no idea
who it's passing up.

519
00:30:26,502 --> 00:30:31,002
Nog, you would have
made a good officer.

520
00:30:31,046 --> 00:30:33,746
I want you
to know something.

521
00:30:33,786 --> 00:30:36,019
There will always be
a place for you here...

522
00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:38,359
at Quark's.

523
00:30:50,525 --> 00:30:51,892
Sorry, Lonzo.

524
00:30:51,929 --> 00:30:54,663
Excuse me, folks,
but the bar has been closed

525
00:30:54,702 --> 00:30:57,139
for over an hour now.

526
00:30:57,174 --> 00:30:59,577
I asked you nicely before,
but if you don't leave

527
00:30:59,614 --> 00:31:01,345
I'm going to have
to call Security.

528
00:31:01,384 --> 00:31:03,412
I am Security.

529
00:31:03,523 --> 00:31:04,924
Don't worry, Quark.

530
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,950
We're going.

531
00:31:16,889 --> 00:31:21,389
I confiscated this
from a Yridian smuggler.

532
00:31:21,432 --> 00:31:23,129
Don't you need it for evidence?

533
00:31:23,171 --> 00:31:24,367
Bah!

534
00:31:26,712 --> 00:31:28,842
I still want to talk to you
about what happened

535
00:31:28,884 --> 00:31:30,513
when I was an initiate.

536
00:31:33,328 --> 00:31:34,991
I know you do.

537
00:31:38,908 --> 00:31:40,343
So...

538
00:31:42,917 --> 00:31:45,754
What is it you want to ask me?

539
00:31:47,395 --> 00:31:48,694
Why didn't you object

540
00:31:48,731 --> 00:31:51,533
when you heard I was
reinstated into the program?

541
00:31:51,606 --> 00:31:54,077
I don't know, Jadzia.

542
00:31:54,111 --> 00:31:56,777
Maybe I decided I'd
been too hard on you.

543
00:31:56,818 --> 00:32:00,281
It was your job to be hard
on initiates.

544
00:32:00,326 --> 00:32:01,886
Yes, but...

545
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,236
The truth is

546
00:32:05,272 --> 00:32:06,536
I felt sorry for you.

547
00:32:09,314 --> 00:32:13,620
Well, you wanted
to be joined so badly.

548
00:32:13,658 --> 00:32:17,691
You were so young, so lovely.

549
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:22,205
I guess I've always had
this nagging feeling

550
00:32:22,245 --> 00:32:24,716
I didn't have
your complete confidence.

551
00:32:24,751 --> 00:32:27,086
I-I tried to push it aside

552
00:32:27,123 --> 00:32:28,752
but now it turns out
I was right.

553
00:32:28,794 --> 00:32:31,323
You never thought I was
good enough to be a host.

554
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:34,899
Whatever I may have thought
doesn't matter.

555
00:32:34,942 --> 00:32:35,910
You are a host.

556
00:32:35,944 --> 00:32:36,934
Isn't that enough?

557
00:32:36,981 --> 00:32:38,075
No.

558
00:32:39,787 --> 00:32:42,281
I feel like I don't
have your respect

559
00:32:42,326 --> 00:32:45,527
and I'm afraid when your
memories are restored to me

560
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:48,838
I'm going to feel
like I don't respect myself.

561
00:32:48,876 --> 00:32:52,373
In that case,
you'll be happy to know

562
00:32:52,418 --> 00:32:54,081
that I've come to a decision

563
00:32:54,122 --> 00:32:56,150
that's going to benefit
both of us.

564
00:32:56,193 --> 00:32:57,719
What do you mean?

565
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,409
I've decided to stay
where I am, in this body.

566
00:33:03,444 --> 00:33:05,506
And I'm not just
speaking as Curzon.

567
00:33:05,549 --> 00:33:07,577
This is Odo's decision as well.

568
00:33:07,621 --> 00:33:09,386
We like what we've become

569
00:33:09,425 --> 00:33:12,991
and neither of us wants to go
back to the way things were.

570
00:33:14,704 --> 00:33:15,832
Ahh!

571
00:33:23,124 --> 00:33:26,621
There's no way to remove
Curzon's memories from Odo

572
00:33:26,699 --> 00:33:28,533
without his cooperation.

573
00:33:28,571 --> 00:33:30,974
He has to give
them up willingly.

574
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,641
What'll happen to Jadzia
if we can't persuade him?

575
00:33:33,683 --> 00:33:37,819
It'll take some time for her
to adjust to the new balance

576
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,660
but she'll be fine.

577
00:33:39,764 --> 00:33:42,201
Do you want me
to talk to Curzon?

578
00:33:42,237 --> 00:33:43,934
I know him better than anyone.

579
00:33:43,975 --> 00:33:46,208
I might be able to get him
to cooperate.

580
00:33:47,249 --> 00:33:48,741
I don't think so.

581
00:33:50,924 --> 00:33:53,624
I don't think
I want to do anything.

582
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,654
What do you mean?

583
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,568
I mean I'm fine.

584
00:33:56,604 --> 00:34:00,603
And obviously, Odo and Curzon
are well-suited to each other.

585
00:34:03,254 --> 00:34:04,795
Maybe it's better this way.

586
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:08,767
I'd like to speak to Jadzia
alone for a moment.

587
00:34:18,093 --> 00:34:21,431
Do you really want to leave
things as they are?

588
00:34:21,468 --> 00:34:24,134
Or are you just trying
to avoid a confrontation

589
00:34:24,174 --> 00:34:25,803
with Curzon?

590
00:34:29,487 --> 00:34:31,651
You once told me

591
00:34:31,692 --> 00:34:35,098
that Curzon intimidated you
when you were an initiate.

592
00:34:35,134 --> 00:34:37,503
I looked up to him.

593
00:34:37,539 --> 00:34:39,737
I still do.

594
00:34:40,981 --> 00:34:43,977
Maybe that's why I find it hard
to challenge his decisions.

595
00:34:44,022 --> 00:34:47,827
Let me tell you
something about Curzon.

596
00:34:47,864 --> 00:34:49,128
He was my friend

597
00:34:49,168 --> 00:34:50,535
he was my confidant.

598
00:34:50,571 --> 00:34:53,373
In a way, he was
my teacher as well

599
00:34:53,411 --> 00:34:58,013
but he was also manipulative,
selfish and arrogant.

600
00:34:58,055 --> 00:34:59,820
Most people let him
get away with it

601
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,227
because he was so charming.

602
00:35:01,263 --> 00:35:04,704
Sometimes, I let him
get away with it, too

603
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:09,341
but, from time to time,
he'd push me too far

604
00:35:09,383 --> 00:35:14,761
and I'd have to stand up to him,
tell him he'd crossed the line.

605
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,097
And how would he react?

606
00:35:18,137 --> 00:35:21,634
Sometimes, he'd just laugh
and admit it.

607
00:35:21,678 --> 00:35:24,047
Sometimes, he'd be furious.

608
00:35:24,085 --> 00:35:28,289
But either way, he'd back off
because he knew he was wrong.

609
00:35:29,597 --> 00:35:32,091
And he is wrong now.

610
00:35:32,137 --> 00:35:35,634
He's being selfish,
and he's manipulated you

611
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:38,481
to get you to go along
with what he wants.

612
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:40,079
Now...

613
00:35:40,123 --> 00:35:42,321
are you going to confront him

614
00:35:42,395 --> 00:35:44,298
or let him get away with it?

615
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,696
It's up to you.

616
00:36:04,548 --> 00:36:06,576
I know what you did.

617
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,987
Take it easy.

618
00:36:08,023 --> 00:36:09,458
What's wrong with you?

619
00:36:09,493 --> 00:36:10,461
You know what's wrong.

620
00:36:10,495 --> 00:36:11,759
You reconfigured the holosuite

621
00:36:11,798 --> 00:36:14,498
so that Nog would fail
the spatial orientation test.

622
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:17,775
I did it for his own good, Rom.

623
00:36:17,813 --> 00:36:19,077
I couldn't just stand by

624
00:36:19,116 --> 00:36:21,246
and watch my nephew
throw his life away.

625
00:36:21,289 --> 00:36:23,317
You had no right to interfere!

626
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,193
I've already told Commander
Sisko what you did

627
00:36:25,231 --> 00:36:26,928
and he's going to let
Nog retake the test.

628
00:36:26,968 --> 00:36:27,993
You what?

629
00:36:28,038 --> 00:36:29,063
You heard me.

630
00:36:29,106 --> 00:36:32,603
And if you ever do anything
to hurt Nog again

631
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,379
I'll burn the bar to the ground.

632
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:35,955
You wouldn't dare.

633
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,152
Oh, yes, I would.

634
00:36:37,193 --> 00:36:39,221
My son's happiness
is more important to me

635
00:36:39,265 --> 00:36:40,632
than anything, even latinum!

636
00:36:40,668 --> 00:36:43,300
Remember that, Brother!

637
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:55,431
Jadzia.

638
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,304
Come in, come in.

639
00:36:58,443 --> 00:37:00,744
I was just oozing
around the room.

640
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:03,585
You have no idea
what a liberating

641
00:37:03,623 --> 00:37:07,895
experience it is
to be in a liquid state.

642
00:37:07,933 --> 00:37:10,063
We need to talk.

643
00:37:11,442 --> 00:37:12,741
All right.

644
00:37:12,779 --> 00:37:15,080
What is it you want
to talk about?

645
00:37:15,117 --> 00:37:17,350
I want my memories back.

646
00:37:17,389 --> 00:37:19,154
Ah...

647
00:37:19,193 --> 00:37:21,061
I'm sorry.

648
00:37:21,098 --> 00:37:24,094
I realize this is
difficult for you

649
00:37:24,138 --> 00:37:25,630
but you'll get over it.

650
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:27,670
Trust me, it's better this way.

651
00:37:27,714 --> 00:37:28,876
For you, maybe.

652
00:37:28,917 --> 00:37:30,751
You're both living out a life

653
00:37:30,788 --> 00:37:32,121
you never could have
had otherwise.

654
00:37:32,158 --> 00:37:33,650
But it's my life you're living.

655
00:37:33,695 --> 00:37:35,130
Those should be my memories.

656
00:37:35,165 --> 00:37:37,159
Not anymore.

657
00:37:37,204 --> 00:37:38,730
Maybe they never
should have been.

658
00:37:38,774 --> 00:37:39,833
That's where you're wrong.

659
00:37:39,876 --> 00:37:41,904
I earned the right to be joined.

660
00:37:41,948 --> 00:37:44,442
I am the only person
in our planet's history

661
00:37:44,488 --> 00:37:46,686
who was ever readmitted
to the initiate program

662
00:37:46,726 --> 00:37:47,820
after being washed out.

663
00:37:47,863 --> 00:37:50,266
The only reason you got back in

664
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:52,899
was because I
felt sorry for you.

665
00:37:52,941 --> 00:37:54,638
Curzon was famous
for rejecting initiates.

666
00:37:54,678 --> 00:37:56,079
Why feel sorry for me?

667
00:37:56,115 --> 00:37:59,817
Now don't you use that tone
of voice with me, little girl.

668
00:37:59,857 --> 00:38:03,161
You can't intimidate me, Curzon.

669
00:38:04,836 --> 00:38:07,604
And I'm not
a little girl anymore.

670
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:16,491
No.

671
00:38:16,565 --> 00:38:18,763
I suppose you're not.

672
00:38:20,407 --> 00:38:22,104
The truth is

673
00:38:22,144 --> 00:38:26,644
you weren't a little girl
back when you were an initiate.

674
00:38:26,689 --> 00:38:30,722
You were a brilliant
and beautiful young woman.

675
00:38:42,326 --> 00:38:43,818
Very beautiful.

676
00:38:47,772 --> 00:38:49,469
You were in love with me?

677
00:38:56,059 --> 00:38:57,996
At first...

678
00:38:58,031 --> 00:38:59,796
I thought it was just

679
00:38:59,834 --> 00:39:02,636
an old man's
passing infatuation.

680
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:08,144
After all, I'd always
had an eye for the ladies.

681
00:39:09,925 --> 00:39:12,419
But as we spent
more time together...

682
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:18,537
I started to realize
it was something...

683
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:20,173
deeper.

684
00:39:22,422 --> 00:39:24,825
Then why were you so hard on me?

685
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:28,165
I couldn't let you
know the truth.

686
00:39:28,203 --> 00:39:29,536
You were an initiate.

687
00:39:29,573 --> 00:39:30,974
I was your supervisor.

688
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,481
So you washed me out
of the program.

689
00:39:33,515 --> 00:39:36,716
Later, I realized
that I'd robbed you

690
00:39:36,757 --> 00:39:38,887
of something you'd
wanted all your life.

691
00:39:38,928 --> 00:39:41,331
I felt so guilty,
I nearly retired

692
00:39:41,367 --> 00:39:43,497
from the Symbiosis Commission.

693
00:39:43,539 --> 00:39:46,478
So when I reapplied,
you didn't object.

694
00:39:46,513 --> 00:39:48,484
On the contrary.

695
00:39:48,518 --> 00:39:51,548
I was grateful
when you reapplied.

696
00:39:51,592 --> 00:39:54,326
It let me off the hook.

697
00:39:57,373 --> 00:40:00,437
So, now that you know

698
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,319
you can see that it's best
for both of us

699
00:40:04,355 --> 00:40:07,226
that I stay here in this body.

700
00:40:07,262 --> 00:40:09,358
Why?
Because you loved me?

701
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,078
Because I still love you.

702
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:26,241
There's no shame in that,
Curzon.

703
00:40:26,275 --> 00:40:28,269
Yes, there is.

704
00:40:28,313 --> 00:40:32,449
And if we rejoin,
you'll feel it, too.

705
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,158
No, I won't...

706
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:38,363
because I love you.

707
00:40:38,404 --> 00:40:41,172
You're a part of me,
and I want you back.

708
00:40:41,211 --> 00:40:44,378
That way, Jadzia and
Curzon can be together

709
00:40:44,418 --> 00:40:46,321
the way they should be...

710
00:40:46,356 --> 00:40:47,825
through Dax.

711
00:41:14,585 --> 00:41:16,385
He's coming!

712
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:20,793
He's coming.

713
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:32,122
Ladies and gentlemen

714
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,965
I'd like to introduce
Starfleet's...

715
00:41:36,003 --> 00:41:37,370
future...

716
00:41:37,405 --> 00:41:39,170
my son, Nog.

717
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:49,456
Congratulations, Nog.

718
00:41:49,501 --> 00:41:50,629
Thank you, sir.

719
00:41:50,671 --> 00:41:53,200
Yeah, way to go.

720
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:54,838
I'm afraid
you've jumped the gun

721
00:41:54,881 --> 00:41:56,111
putting on that uniform.

722
00:41:56,151 --> 00:41:59,056
I know I haven't earned
the right to wear it yet

723
00:41:59,091 --> 00:42:01,893
but my father got it for me.

724
00:42:01,931 --> 00:42:03,799
Hopefully,
you'll get to put on

725
00:42:03,835 --> 00:42:05,304
the real one next year.

726
00:42:07,344 --> 00:42:09,406
When you ace the Academy
Entrance Exam.

727
00:42:14,327 --> 00:42:16,195
What's the matter, Chief?

728
00:42:16,232 --> 00:42:18,203
It just occurred to me.

729
00:42:18,237 --> 00:42:20,265
As soon as that kid
graduates from the Academy

730
00:42:20,308 --> 00:42:21,937
I'm going to have
to call him "sir."

731
00:42:23,951 --> 00:42:25,648
Okay.

732
00:42:30,567 --> 00:42:32,561
What can I get you, Nog?

733
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,039
Oh.

734
00:42:36,514 --> 00:42:37,949
A root beer.

735
00:42:39,054 --> 00:42:40,489
It's an Earth drink...

736
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:42,927
something they serve
at the Academy.

737
00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:47,703
A root beer.

738
00:42:47,741 --> 00:42:51,011
This is the end
of Ferengi civilization.

739
00:43:03,712 --> 00:43:06,081
May I join you, Lieutenant?

740
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:07,554
Of course.

741
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:18,170
I'd just like to apologize
for my behavior

742
00:43:18,213 --> 00:43:20,777
while I was joined
with Curzon.

743
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:23,725
There's no need to apologize.

744
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,095
In a way, I'm glad it happened.

745
00:43:26,132 --> 00:43:29,937
It forced me to deal
with some things about myself

746
00:43:29,975 --> 00:43:32,504
I've never really faced.

747
00:43:32,548 --> 00:43:37,116
Besides, you've...
given me a special gift.

748
00:43:38,429 --> 00:43:39,762
Oh?

749
00:43:41,336 --> 00:43:43,934
You see...

750
00:43:43,975 --> 00:43:45,843
now I have Curzon's memories

751
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,444
of what it felt like
to be a changeling.

752
00:43:48,553 --> 00:43:52,723
I never realized
how much joy it gives you.

753
00:43:52,764 --> 00:43:56,831
And I never understood
how much joy

754
00:43:56,873 --> 00:44:02,980
you humanoids experience
in things like eating, drinking

755
00:44:03,021 --> 00:44:06,655
staying up all night
playing <i>tongo.</i>

756
00:44:08,133 --> 00:44:10,263
Frankly, I don't see how Curzon

757
00:44:10,305 --> 00:44:12,869
ever managed to get
any work done.

758
00:44:12,912 --> 00:44:16,444
He always seemed to somehow.

759
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,149
Well...

760
00:44:19,627 --> 00:44:22,464
he must have been
a remarkable man.

761
00:44:23,804 --> 00:44:26,071
Yes, he is.
