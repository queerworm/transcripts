1
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:05,130
COMPUTER: The Cardassians
are still closing.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,175
They have powered
their weapon systems.

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:10,385
(<i> Nog sighing</i> )

4
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:11,804
(<i> console beeping</i> )

5
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:15,766
They have established
weapons lock.

6
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:24,065
Weapons lock broken.

7
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,150
(<i> laughs</i> )

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,360
Going to warp.

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,445
(<i> knocking</i> )

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,034
Get out of here, Jake!

11
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,744
I'm-I'm in the middle
of a simulation!

12
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,038
I said get out of here!

13
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,667
Computer, end program.

14
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:42,751
Oh! Oh, oh!

15
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:43,752
You okay?

16
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,880
Look what you
made me do.

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,046
Well, you should know

18
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,757
not to end a program
sitting down.

19
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,217
Why did you come in here?

20
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,386
You were supposed to meet
me half an hour ago.

21
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:56,181
Well, I didn't realize
it had gotten so late.

22
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,098
Sorry.

23
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,350
Don't worry about it.

24
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,852
How's it going, anyway?

25
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:02,604
Pretty good, I've
improved my reaction time

26
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,981
by almost 20 percent

27
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:06,358
but I've got to get it up
another five.

28
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:07,776
Is that the cutoff point

29
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,778
for getting into the Academy
Preparatory Program?

30
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,279
Exactly.

31
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,866
Don't worry about it, Nog.

32
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:14,867
You'll get there.

33
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,284
I'd better.

34
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,286
Because if I don't
get into the program,

35
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:21,665
I'll never be admitted
into the Academy next year.

36
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,918
You think six weeks
of summer classes

37
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:25,502
will make the difference?

38
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,712
If I do well.

39
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,756
I have to show
the admissions committee

40
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:31,508
how determined I am
to become a cadet.

41
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,969
Don't worry so much, Nog.

42
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,804
You'll be a great cadet.

43
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,973
In the meantime,

44
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:40,350
you make a lousy stock boy.

45
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,978
Why can't you take after
your friend here?

46
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:46,565
He knows enough
to stay<i> out</i> of Starfleet.

47
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:48,567
Even a human can see

48
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,778
there's a lot more
profitable opportunities

49
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:51,946
out there for a young man

50
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:53,280
with ambition.

51
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,699
Uncle, he wants
to be a writer.

52
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,534
There's no profit in that.

53
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:02,497
On the contrary,
writing holosuite programs--

54
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,625
especially the more
intimate variety--

55
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,710
is<i> very</i> profitable.

56
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,003
I'll bet.

57
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,337
I'll tell you what.

58
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,090
The two of you come up
with a proposal,

59
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,466
and I'll put up the latinum

60
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,968
for your
first program.

61
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:18,179
I don't think so, Uncle.

62
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,474
QUARK:
All right, fine...

63
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,350
join Starfleet.

64
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,603
I don't know why I bother
trying to help you anyway.

65
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,438
Go down to the storeroom
and get your father.

66
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,440
Tell him to get
behind the bar.

67
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,359
Lieutenant Dax has asked me
to join the senior staff

68
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,821
for a very important
meeting in the wardroom.

69
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:40,327
Do you have any idea

70
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,037
what Dax wants to
talk to us about?

71
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,413
No.

72
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,332
Apparently, she asked
Leeta to come as well.

73
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,667
Hmm. I've noticed
they've been spending

74
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,043
quite a bit
of time together.

75
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:51,296
Do you keep tabs on
everybody, Constable?

76
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,506
Not everyone.

77
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,008
But really, Doctor,

78
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,677
two Delvin fluff pastries
for breakfast this morning?

79
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,219
You of all people
should know better

80
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,847
than to start
your day like that.

81
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,890
(<i> laughs</i> )

82
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,059
(<i> quiet conversations</i> )

83
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,605
Major. Chief.

84
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,731
Hello, Leeta

85
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,732
Oh, hello.

86
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,442
And how are you doing?

87
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,570
Thank you all for coming.

88
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,571
BASHIR:
No problem.

89
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,781
O'BRIEN:
What's up?

90
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,952
I'll get
right to the point.

91
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,163
You are the seven people
on this station

92
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:25,706
that I feel closest to,

93
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,167
and I want you all to be
a part of my<i> zhian'tara.</i>

94
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:30,335
<i>Zhian'tara,</i>
what's that?

95
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,504
It's the Trill rite of closure.
I've read about it.

96
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,213
DAX:
The<i> zhian'tara</i>
is a ritual

97
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:35,799
where joined Trills
get a chance

98
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,551
to actually meet
their previous hosts.

99
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,094
Meet them-- how?

100
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,346
That's where
you come in.

101
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:45,100
If you don't mind, I'd
like to borrow your bodies

102
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,434
for a few hours.

103
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,604
What do you mean,
"borrow" our bodies?

104
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,106
DAX:
Well, if you agree

105
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,398
to participate,

106
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,358
the memories of one
of my previous hosts

107
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,360
will be temporarily removed
from the symbiont

108
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,612
and imprinted onto you.

109
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,363
You essentially become
one of my hosts

110
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,283
for the duration
of the ritual.

111
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,202
And how is this
accomplished?

112
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,996
The memories are transferred
telepathically by a Guardian.

113
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,413
A Guardian?

114
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,166
LEETA:
They take care of
the symbionts.

115
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,293
Usually, they're unjoined Trill.

116
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:19,338
Leeta is sort of an
amateur sociologist.

117
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,089
It comes in handy
in my line of work.

118
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,843
You never know who you'll meet
at the dabo table.

119
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,136
You're asking me

120
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,347
to hand my body over
to some dead person.

121
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:30,349
Only for a few hours.

122
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:33,727
Uh-huh. What happens
to me in the meantime?

123
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,562
You'll remain
conscious

124
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,356
of everything that's
going on around you.

125
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:40,150
And at any time, you can
reassert yourself

126
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,235
and regain control
of your body.

127
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,736
But it's best to relax

128
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,113
and let the host's
memories emerge.

129
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,324
The point is to give
Jadzia a chance

130
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,784
to interact with
her previous hosts.

131
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,787
Curzon spoke very fondly
of his<i> zhian'tara.</i>

132
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,164
He said it was one

133
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:57,000
of the most powerful
experiences of his life.

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,378
I do have one question.

135
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:00,962
What about Joran?

136
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:06,009
Joran... wasn't he
the, uh, crazy host of yours--

137
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,552
the musician
who killed someone?

138
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:11,472
Uh, Commander Sisko has
volunteered to embody Joran.

139
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,141
We've already discussed

140
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,103
taking certain precautions
during the transfer.

141
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,272
Well, count me in.

142
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,564
Me, too.

143
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,192
Yes.

144
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,193
Agreed.

145
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,152
Chief?

146
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,363
Oh, yes, yeah, I'm in.

147
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,871
Why is everybody looking at me?

148
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:38,875
Because you're the only one who
hasn't agreed to participate.

149
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:44,256
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

150
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:47,717
You're going to have
to find someone else.

151
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,179
I<i> really</i> want you to be
a part of this, Quark.

152
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:55,475
I was hoping that you
would embody Audrid for me.

153
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,602
Well...

154
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:01,064
I think it will
make us closer.

155
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,651
Uh... when you put it
that way...

156
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,112
DAX:
I knew I could
count on you.

157
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:11,158
Kira, I would like
you to embody Lela

158
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,742
my first host.

159
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,077
We'll start tomorrow

160
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,079
after the Guardian
arrives.

161
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,414
It means a lot to me

162
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,083
that all of you are
willing to do this.

163
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,294
Thank you.

164
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:33,138
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but did Quark just agree

165
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,223
to embody one
of your female hosts?

166
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,142
Yes, he did.

167
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,269
Hmm.

168
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:48,445
After that, comes the deductive
reasoning portion of the exam

169
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,238
and then the spatial
orientation test.

170
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,032
The whole thing should
take about four days.

171
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,910
Now, I know it must sound
overwhelming to you.

172
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,121
Just try to take it
one day at a time.

173
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:01,875
One day at a time, right.

174
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,085
And today, all you
have to worry about

175
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,171
is the stress
reaction test.

176
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:09,007
Computer, run
program delta 5 9.

177
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:14,346
I-I thought this was going
to be a runabout simulation.

178
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:15,430
No.

179
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,016
But... that's what I practiced.

180
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,310
Well, if we tested you
where you practiced,

181
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,063
it wouldn't exactly be
stressful, now would it?

182
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,315
Man your post.

183
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,401
You're the Operations
Officer on duty.

184
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,286
(<i> rumbling</i> )

185
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,329
What was that?!

186
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,830
(<i> console beeping</i> )

187
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,082
You tell me.

188
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,050
We've been
trying to get Dax

189
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,510
back to the homeworld

190
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,179
to perform the<i> zhian'tara</i>
for some time now.

191
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,182
She kept putting us off,
so the Symbiosis Commission

192
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:02,561
decided to force the issue
and send me here.

193
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,604
I just haven't had time
to get away.

194
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,147
You could have
made the time.

195
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,816
Where is the<i> zhian'tara</i>
to take place?

196
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,651
I have preparations
to make.

197
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:11,945
This way.

198
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,121
<i>I'nora, ja'kala Dax...</i>

199
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,416
<i>zhian'shee, Lela tanus rem.</i>

00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,586

00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:30,630

00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,789
Kira?

205
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,917
No...

206
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,669
Lela.

207
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,177
You must be Dax's new host.

208
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,470
I'm Jadzia.

209
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,515
Oh, what a<i> beautiful</i> name.

210
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,724
I have a few questions
for both of you.

211
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,018
I need to make sure

212
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,479
the memory transference
is complete.

213
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:28,687
Go ahead.

214
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,898
What is the last thing
you remember?

215
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:34,194
Talking to Curzon
at his<i> zhian'tara.</i>

216
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,572
Can you tell me
the name of the person

217
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:41,117
who supervised Lela
when she was an initiate?

218
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,370
No, I can't remember.

219
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,954
Well, that's
perfectly all right.

220
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,623
It just means Lela's memories

221
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,875
have been temporarily
removed from your mind.

222
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,960
It's a little
disorienting,

223
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,587
like part of me
is suddenly missing.

224
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,214
Not missing--

225
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,341
right here--

226
00:11:56,341 --> 00:12:01,304
and the name of my initiate
supervisor was Jobel.

227
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:05,642
Excellent, the transference
seems to be complete.

228
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,520
Unless either of you
have any questions,

229
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,938
I'll leave you alone
for a few hours.

230
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,106
Thank you.

231
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:18,905
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

232
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:22,617
Such odd fellows
these Guardians are.

233
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,452
I know.

234
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:28,582
Well, it's understandable,
I suppose.

235
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,250
They spend most
of their time underground,

236
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,128
tending symbiont pools
full of this stuff.

237
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,342
Ah, I love the smell of it.

238
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,801
Don't you?

239
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:53,106
It looks like you've ended up
a long way from home, Jadzia.

240
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,695
What is it?

241
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:03,283
It's just, uh... I hold
my hands behind my back...

242
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,951
the same way you do.

243
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:10,789
Ah, it's a habit I picked up
when I was a legislator.

244
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:15,044
I was one of the first women
to serve as a council member.

245
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:19,382
When I started out,
I talked with my hands a lot,

246
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,342
lots of emphatic gesturing.

247
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,885
I discovered

248
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,347
some of my male colleagues
were imitating me,

249
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,891
so I started to do this.

250
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,436
I just thought it was
an unconscious habit.

251
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,354
I never realized why I did it.

252
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:37,858
Ah, that's the point
of a<i> zhian'tara--</i>

253
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:42,989
to discover these<i> things</i>
about yourself.

254
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,659
It's so strange.

255
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,411
It's like you really are Lela.

256
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,413
Well, in a sense, I am.

257
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:55,585
After all, what is a person
but a sum of their memories?

258
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:58,797
Oh...

259
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:03,050
I have a feeling that
these next few days

260
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:07,597
are going to be
extraordinary for you.

261
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,229
(<i> sighs</i> )

262
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,151
Tobin, I don't think
Chief O'Brien

263
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:23,112
is going to appreciate
you biting his nails.

264
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,990
Sorry.

265
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,242
I guess I'm
a little nervous.

266
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,328
That's all right.

267
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,288
I get that way
sometimes myself.

268
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,998
And now you know

269
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,375
who you have
to thank for it.

270
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,793
Sorry.

271
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,379
Will you please stop
saying you're sorry?

272
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,714
Sorry.

273
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:44,050
I've been working on
finishing your proof

274
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,260
of Fermat's Last Theorem.

275
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,095
You have?!

276
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:52,308
It's the most original
approach to the proof...

277
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,102
since Wiles, over 300 years ago.

278
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,062
Thanks.

279
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,564
I guess I
tend to look

280
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,399
for original approaches myself.

281
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,443
I guess I have you
to thank for that as well.

282
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,574
(<i> clapping</i> )

283
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,744
Very nice.

284
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:11,870
This is an
excellent body

285
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,079
you managed
to get for me.

286
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,955
I'll be sure
to pass that along.

287
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,958
I remember when I first
got the Dax symbiont.

288
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,210
I was worried that it might

289
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,879
affect my coordination
in some way.

290
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,171
And hurt your gymnastics career.

291
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,423
As it turned out,

292
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,842
being joined
improved my concentration.

293
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:29,512
Really? I found
that as well.

294
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:30,847
You're a gymnast?

295
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,599
No, but I'm
an expert

296
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,183
in Klingon
martial arts.

297
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,643
Oh.

298
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,019
Did you take it up

299
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,856
before or after
you were joined?

300
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,357
After.

301
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,821
Why am I not surprised?

302
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,788
(<i> in a soft, sweet voice):</i>
Sit right here, and I'll
tell you all about it.

303
00:15:57,415 --> 00:16:00,460
The day I was named head
of the Symbiosis Commission

304
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,087
was one of the happiest
of my life.

305
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:07,091
Right behind the day I gave
birth to my first child.

306
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,137
Are you a mother, Jadzia?

307
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,722
No.

308
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:16,058
Oh... I hope you
will be someday.

309
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:21,188
There's nothing quite like
holding a baby to your breast,

310
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,816
nursing it...

311
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:31,407
The entity that lent me
this body wishes to speak.

312
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,830
(<i> normally</i> ):
How much longer am I
going to have to do this?

313
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,581
Another hour at most.

314
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,667
And the sooner
we get back to it,

315
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,502
the sooner
it'll be over.

316
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:46,673
Just remember, not a word
about this to anyone.

317
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,175
I promise.

318
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,015
Maybe you should go easy
on those, Torias.

319
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,391
Julian was just telling me
the other day

320
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,101
he's started
to watch what he eats.

321
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,228
Well, you should tell
your friend to live a little.

322
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,605
Life's too short

323
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:05,107
to deprive yourself
of the simple pleasures.

324
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,526
I should know.

325
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,779
You didn't exactly
deprive yourself.

326
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,657
No, but my life<i> was</i> too short.

327
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,367
The accident.

328
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,285
Still, I'm lucky.

329
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:20,039
I continue to exist,
as part of you,

330
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,833
just as Jadzia
will go on existing

331
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,418
when the symbiont
is passed on to a new host.

332
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,963
We're part of something
bigger than any one of us.

333
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:30,132
I just feel lucky
to have been chosen.

334
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,010
So do I.

335
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,136
(<i> door chimes</i> )

336
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,388
Come in.

337
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,560
It's late.

338
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,647
I think it's time we returned
Dr. Bashir's body to him.

339
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:49,027
It was nice meeting you.

340
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,786
I'm ready.

341
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,331
Are you sure about this,
Commander?

342
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,791
Don't worry, Odo.

343
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,793
Joran isn't going to be able
to hurt anyone

344
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,545
from inside of a holding cell.

345
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,547
There's just one problem.

346
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,925
<i>You're</i> going to be
in there with him.

347
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,092
Hmm.

348
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,732
Activate the force field.

349
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,589
Joran.

350
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:55,217
(<i> high, melodic voice):</i>
Hello, Jadzia.

351
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:06,145
If you need me,
I'll be right outside.

352
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,605
As will I.

353
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,823
It's good to see you again,
Jadzia.

354
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:30,210
Tell me, have you been
practicing your music?

355
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,172
Yes, when I have the time.

356
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,382
Good.

357
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,635
Do you think of me
when you play?

358
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,930
Sometimes.

359
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:44,350
I'm glad.

360
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,811
You're a very

361
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:50,230
pretty girl, Jadzia.

362
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,525
Very pretty.

363
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:59,323
But unfortunately,
that's all you are.

364
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,826
You're nothing

365
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:04,787
compared to
Lela, Torias,

366
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:07,707
or myself.

367
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,002
You're a pretender.

368
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:14,172
You must realize that by now.

369
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,590
You don't know
anything about me.

370
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,719
Only what I can see.

371
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,930
A little girl, not worthy

372
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,059
of the noble creature
nestled inside her.

373
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:29,603
You're overwhelmed by it.

374
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,856
You're in over your head.

375
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,816
(<i> snickers</i> )

376
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,985
And they said
it was a mistake

377
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,487
choosing<i> me</i> for joining.

378
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:46,579
But there is one hope
for you, Jadzia,

379
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,790
and that's me.

380
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:53,293
My strength is within you.

381
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:57,131
You don't have
to be afraid of it.

382
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,299
I'm not.

383
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,593
Then let me
show you

384
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,763
how to use it.

385
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:07,975
Lower the force field, Jadzia.

386
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,770
Lower it...

387
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:16,943
and you will never have to be
afraid of anything ever again.

388
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,695
No.

389
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,579
Joran!

390
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,250
Stop it.
You're hurting him!

391
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,127
Benjamin,
take control!

392
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,466
(<i> normally</i> ): I think that's
enough of Joran for now.

393
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,890
Are you all right?

394
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,814
JORAN:
Surprise.

395
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:13,082
(<i> normally</i> ):
It's all right, old man.

396
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,083
It's me.

397
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,169
(<i> panting</i> )

398
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:19,797
Whoo!

399
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:20,923
Thanks.

400
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,051
For what?

401
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:27,847
For not breaking any bones.

402
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,037
PATRONS:
Dabo!

403
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,173
Will you stop doing that?

404
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:03,674
It's very distracting.

405
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,719
I'm trying to do the books.

406
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,346
I can't help it.

407
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:10,223
My son's future is being decided
at this very minute.

408
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:13,559
Well, pacing around
like some Alvanian cave sloth

409
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,144
isn't going to help him.

410
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,159
What's that?

411
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,914
Uh... a cadet's uniform.

412
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,165
I got it for Nog.

413
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:40,211
I had Garak make it to order.

414
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,504
It cost five strips of latinum.

415
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,589
Well, you wasted
your money.

416
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,091
He's not going to need it.

417
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:46,508
Why not?

418
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,723
Because...
he'll be issued a uniform

419
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:55,351
if and when he gets
to the Academy.

420
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:58,396
Well, now he'll have two.

421
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,067
I keep thinking about Joran.

422
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,484
I heard what he told you.

423
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:07,113
I can't seem to get
it out of my head.

424
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:11,158
Jadzia, did you put off
having your<i> zhian'tara</i>

425
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,910
because you were afraid
you wouldn't measure up

426
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,661
to the other hosts?

427
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,164
I don't know,
maybe I did.

428
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,582
Now that it's almost over,

429
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,626
I hope you realize
you were wrong.

430
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,296
I'm not so sure I was.

431
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,298
I don't understand
how you could say that.

432
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:28,134
You were chosen for joining
because you deserved it,

433
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:29,927
just as much
as any of the others.

434
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:32,054
If that's true,
then why did Curzon

435
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:34,056
wash me
out of the initiate program?

436
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:35,766
You tell me.

437
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:38,685
I've always believed

438
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,562
it was because he
wanted to challenge me

439
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:43,357
so that I would reapply
and try harder.

440
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:45,818
Now I'm not so sure.

441
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,069
Why not?

442
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,113
That's exactly
what you did.

443
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:52,699
Maybe Curzon just didn't
think I was good enough.

444
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,576
I find that hard to believe.

445
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,870
But if that's
what you're afraid of,

446
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:00,458
why don't you ask him
when you see him?

447
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,960
I will...

448
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,378
but what if he tells me

449
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:06,755
something I don't
want to hear?

450
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,762
I have to go.

451
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:24,148
<i>Jadzia, zhian'tara vok.</i>

452
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,442
<i>Tu Dax, zhian'tani ress.</i>

453
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:29,778
<i>Zhian'par, Odo garu'koj...</i>

454
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:00,600
I'm going to my office
for a while.

455
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:05,356
Benjamin!

456
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:07,774
You do recognize me,
don't you?

457
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,276
Curzon?

458
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:13,239
Don't tell me,
the nose gave me away, huh?

459
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,198
(<i> laughs</i> )

460
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,324
What's the matter?

461
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:16,992
Aren't you happy to see me?

462
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,536
Of course.

463
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:20,413
Of course.

464
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,123
So, where's Jadzia?

465
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,291
Ah, it's all right.

466
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,543
I told her I wanted
to come see you.

467
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:26,877
That we'd meet up later
at Quark's.

468
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:29,213
I'm going to give
that little toad

469
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:30,548
the scare of his life.

470
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:32,466
You sound like Odo.

471
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,176
I am Odo.

472
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:35,469
I don't understand.

473
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,388
I thought you
were Curzon.

474
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:38,805
I'm both.

475
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,892
The, uh, Guardian thinks
it has something to do

476
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:43,977
with my shape-shifting
nature.

477
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:48,107
It's as if Odo and Curzon
have been joined.

478
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,192
It's proven to be quite
an interesting experience

479
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:51,609
for both of us.

480
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:53,571
In any case,
the Guardian says

481
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:55,239
it's nothing
to worry about.

482
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:57,324
I like the beard,
by the way.

483
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,492
Yeah?

484
00:26:58,492 --> 00:26:59,910
Absolutely.

485
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:05,040
So... when is Kasidy Yates
coming back, huh?

486
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,292
Huh?

487
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,625
Not you, too.

488
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,003
Well, she's a fine-looking
woman, Ben.

489
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,672
Reminds me of the girl
you took up with on Pelios...

490
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,341
Why don't we join
Jadzia in Quark's?

491
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,469
And let Jake
finish his homework.

492
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:18,137
I'll tell you
all about it later.

493
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,138
Okay.

494
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,056
Curzon, remember?

495
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,488
(<i> gruffly</i> ):
Quark!

496
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,284
Odo?

497
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:43,454
What happened to your face?

498
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:45,498
Never mind my face.

499
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,209
Did I ever mention

500
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,961
you're a magnificent
scoundrel?

501
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:53,172
Two<i> tranyas</i> please,
very cold.

502
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,299
Right away.

503
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:02,722
It's going to take Quark

504
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,724
a little while
to get over that.

505
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,352
Jadzia.

506
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:08,604
It looks like the two of you
are having a good time.

507
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:10,606
Well, as good a time as
two gentlemen can have

508
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,690
without the
company of a lady.

509
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,900
Please, join us.

510
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:20,824
Excuse me while I slip into
something more appropriate.

511
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:24,911
Ah!

512
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:25,912
(<i> laughs</i> )

513
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,540
I love being a changeling.

514
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,915
SISKO:
Well, if you two

515
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:31,377
don't mind, I think
I'll be pushing off.

516
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,086
Benjamin, don't go.

517
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,297
I have to finish evaluating
Nog's test results.

518
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:37,174
He's waiting
to hear how he did.

519
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:41,720
Thanks for stopping by,
old man.

520
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,389
It was good to see you.

521
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:44,473
Oh!

522
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:52,272
Well, there goes
the best friend I ever had.

523
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,566
Well?

524
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:03,992
So... are you enjoying
your<i> zhian'tara?</i>

525
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,994
For the most part.

526
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:09,873
What about that Tobin, huh?

527
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,751
Did he tell you that I got him
drunk for the first time

528
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,253
during my<i> zhian'tara?</i>

529
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,504
(<i> laughing</i> ):
No.

530
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,839
But I can see why you did.

531
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,846
Curzon, there's something
I want to talk to you about.

532
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,348
Oh?

533
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:28,141
Do you remember when
I was an initiate?

534
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:32,145
Do you see that
Ferengi over there?

535
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,607
A bulletin came in
on him last week.

536
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:36,858
He's a<i> tongo</i> hustler.

537
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,985
I'd love to clean him out.

538
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,946
We should get a game going.

539
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,531
(<i> laughs</i> )

540
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,459
<i>Tongo!</i>

541
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:54,960
(<i> laughs</i> )

542
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,673
I just don't
understand

543
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:02,134
how I could have
failed, Father.

544
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,928
You've always been so good
with spatial orientation.

545
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,347
Remember the time
we redid the floors

546
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,683
and you managed
to stack all the chairs

547
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,435
so they fit
behind the bar?

548
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,437
Now I won't qualify

549
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:16,106
to take the Academy
Entrance Exam.

550
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:18,150
My Starfleet
career is over

551
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,401
before it even started.

552
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,153
QUARK:
He's right,
you know.

553
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,655
And it's not fair.

554
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:26,032
Starfleet has no idea
who it's passing up.

555
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:30,370
Nog, you would have
made a good officer.

556
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,039
I want you
to know something.

557
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,417
There will always be
a place for you here--

558
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,919
at Quark's.

559
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,308
Sorry, Lonzo.

560
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:54,227
Excuse me, folks,
but the bar has been closed

561
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,438
for over an hour now.

562
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:59,024
I asked you nicely before,
but if you don't leave,

563
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,859
I'm going to have
to call Security.

564
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,944
I<i> am</i> Security.

565
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,404
Don't worry,
Quark.

566
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,447
We're<i> going.</i>

567
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,533
(<i> grumbling</i> )

568
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:14,956
(<i> Odo/Curzon sighs</i>
<i>and chuckles</i> )

569
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:20,754
I confiscated this
from a Yridian smuggler.

570
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:22,464
Don't you need it for evidence?

571
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:23,923
Bah!

572
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:28,261
I still want to talk to you
about what happened

573
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,888
when I was an initiate.

574
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,434
I know you do.

575
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,857
So...

576
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,111
What is it you
want to ask me?

577
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,240
Why didn't you object

578
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,826
when you heard I was
reinstated into the program?

579
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:53,119
I don't know, Jadzia.

580
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:56,122
Maybe I decided I'd
been too hard on you.

581
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:59,543
It was your job to be hard
on initiates.

582
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:01,002
Yes, but...

583
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,546
(<i> sighs</i> )

584
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:04,506
The truth is

585
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:05,924
I felt sorry for you.

586
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:12,972
Well, you wanted
to be joined so badly.

587
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:17,102
You were so young, so lovely.

588
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:21,314
I guess I've always had
this nagging feeling

589
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,067
I didn't have
your complete confidence.

590
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,194
I-I tried to push it aside,

591
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,071
but now it turns out
I was right.

592
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,490
You never thought I was
good enough to be a host.

593
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,077
Whatever I may have thought
doesn't matter.

594
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:34,994
You<i> are</i> a host.

595
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,121
Isn't that enough?

596
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,289
No.

597
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:41,460
I feel like I don't
have your respect,

598
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,044
and I'm afraid
when your memories

599
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,588
are restored to me,

600
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:47,966
I'm going to feel
like I don't respect myself.

601
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,428
In that case,
you'll be happy to know

602
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:53,012
that I've come to a decision

603
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:55,390
that's going to benefit
both of us.

604
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,850
What do you mean?

605
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:02,481
I've decided to stay
where I am, in this body.

606
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,858
And I'm not just
speaking as Curzon.

607
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,819
This is Odo's decision as well.

608
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:08,570
We like what we've become,

609
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:12,198
and neither of us wants to go
back to the way things were.

610
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,910
Ahh!

611
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,745
(<i> chuckling</i> )

612
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:25,211
There's no way to remove
Curzon's memories from Odo

613
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,255
without his cooperation.

614
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,174
He has to give
them up willingly.

615
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,425
What'll happen
to Jadzia

616
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,093
if we can't
persuade him?

617
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,762
It'll take
some time for her

618
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:36,348
to adjust
to the new balance,

619
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,141
but she'll be fine.

620
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:41,353
Do you want me to
talk to Curzon?

621
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:42,938
I know him better than anyone.

622
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,398
I might be able to get him
to cooperate.

623
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:47,818
I don't think so.

624
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,781
I don't think
I want to do anything.

625
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:53,824
What do you mean?

626
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:55,868
I mean I'm fine.

627
00:33:55,868 --> 00:34:00,038
And obviously, Odo and Curzon
are well-suited to each other.

628
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,250
Maybe it's better this way.

629
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:08,421
I'd like to speak to Jadzia
alone for a moment.

630
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:21,142
Do you really want to leave
things as they are?

631
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,770
Or are you just trying
to avoid a confrontation

632
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,605
with Curzon?

633
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,361
You once told me

634
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:34,907
that Curzon intimidated you
when you were an initiate.

635
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:37,158
I looked up to him.

636
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,244
I still do.

637
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:40,370
(<i> sighs</i> )

638
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,997
Maybe that's why
I find it hard

639
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,749
to challenge
his decisions.

640
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:47,586
Let me tell you
something about Curzon.

641
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:48,670
He was my friend,

642
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,171
he was
my confidant.

643
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,966
In a way, he was
my teacher as well,

644
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:57,554
but he was also manipulative,
selfish, and arrogant.

645
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,472
Most people let him
get away with it

646
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:00,766
because he was so charming.

647
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:04,185
Sometimes, I let him
get away with it, too,

648
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:08,941
but, from time to time,
he'd push me too far,

649
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:11,693
and I'd have
to stand up to him,

650
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:14,320
tell him he'd
crossed the line.

651
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,490
And how would he react?

652
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,994
Sometimes, he'd just laugh
and admit it.

653
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:23,413
Sometimes, he'd be furious.

654
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:27,626
But either way, he'd back off
because he knew he was wrong.

655
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:31,463
And he is wrong now.

656
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:35,092
He's being selfish,
and he's manipulated you

657
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:36,134
to get you
to go along

658
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,844
with what<i> he</i> wants.

659
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,554
Now...

660
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,640
are you going to confront him

661
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,600
or let him get away with it?

662
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,104
It's up to you.

663
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:06,039
I know what you did.

664
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,499
Take it easy.

665
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:08,834
What's wrong with you?

666
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,085
You know what's wrong.

667
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:11,210
You reconfigured
the holosuite

668
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,378
so that Nog would fail

669
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,922
the spatial
orientation test.

670
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:17,216
I did it for his
own good, Rom.

671
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,593
I couldn't just stand by

672
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,679
and watch my nephew
throw his life away.

673
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,514
You had no right
to interfere!

674
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,599
I've already told Commander
Sisko what you did,

675
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,392
and he's going to let
Nog retake the test.

676
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,352
You what?

677
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,436
You heard me.

678
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,647
And if you ever
do anything

679
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:31,857
to hurt Nog again,

680
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:33,775
I'll burn the bar
to the ground.

681
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,027
You wouldn't dare.

682
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:36,528
Oh, yes, I would.

683
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,655
My son's happiness
is more important to me

684
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:39,990
than anything,
even<i> latinum!</i>

685
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,868
Remember<i> that,</i> Brother!

686
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:54,713
Jadzia.

687
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,673
Come in, come in.

688
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:57,674
(<i> chuckles</i> )

689
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:58,800
I was just oozing

690
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,010
around the room.

691
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,929
You have no idea
what a liberating

692
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:07,266
experience it is
to be in a liquid state.

693
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,477
We need to talk.

694
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:11,938
All right.

695
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,482
What is it you want
to talk about?

696
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,693
I want my memories back.

697
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:18,486
Ah...

698
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,321
I'm sorry.

699
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,408
I realize this is
difficult for you,

700
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:24,826
but you'll get over it.

701
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,953
Trust me, it's
better this way.

702
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,121
For you, maybe.

703
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:29,915
You're both living out a life

704
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,332
you never could have
had otherwise.

705
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,876
But it's<i> my</i> life
you're living.

706
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:34,460
Those should be my memories.

707
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,421
Not anymore.

708
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:37,881
Maybe they never
should have been.

709
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:39,174
That's where
you're wrong.

710
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,134
I earned the right to be joined.

711
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:43,636
I am the only person
in our planet's history

712
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,847
who was ever readmitted
to the initiate program

713
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,015
after being washed out.

714
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:49,559
The only reason
you got back in

715
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:52,145
was because I felt
sorry for you.

716
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:53,479
Curzon was famous
for rejecting initiates.

717
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,232
Why feel sorry for me?

718
00:37:55,232 --> 00:37:59,111
Now don't you use that tone
of voice with me, little girl.

719
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:02,530
You can't intimidate me, Curzon.

720
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,910
And I'm not
a little girl anymore.

721
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,666
(<i> sighs</i> )

722
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,710
No.

723
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,088
I suppose you're not.

724
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,382
The truth is

725
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:25,804
you weren't a little girl
back when you were an initiate.

726
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:30,016
You were a brilliant
and beautiful young woman.

727
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,113
Very beautiful.

728
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,743
You were in love with me?

729
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:57,252
At first...

730
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,878
I thought it was just

731
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,840
an old man's
passing infatuation.

732
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:07,553
After all, I'd always
had an eye for the ladies.

733
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:13,101
But as we spent
more time together,

734
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:17,772
I started to realize
it was something...

735
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,398
deeper.

736
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:24,863
Then why were you
so hard on me?

737
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:27,490
I couldn't let you
know the truth.

738
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,700
You were an initiate.

739
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,243
I was your supervisor.

740
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:32,745
So you washed me out
of the program.

741
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,790
Later, I realized
that I'd robbed you

742
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,043
of something you'd
wanted all your life.

743
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:40,586
I felt so guilty,
I nearly retired

744
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,839
from the Symbiosis
Commission.

745
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,884
So when I reapplied,
you didn't object.

746
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,760
On the contrary.

747
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,930
I was grateful
when you reapplied.

748
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,683
It let me off the hook.

749
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:59,647
So, now that you know,

750
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,108
you can see that it's best
for both of us

751
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:06,238
that I stay here in this body.

752
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:08,531
Why?
Because you loved me?

753
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:14,787
Because I still love you.

754
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:25,298
There's no shame
in that, Curzon.

755
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:27,300
Yes, there is.

756
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:31,596
And if we rejoin,
you'll feel it, too.

757
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:35,225
No, I won't...

758
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:37,394
because I love you.

759
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:40,188
You're a part of me,
and I want you back.

760
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:43,482
That way, Jadzia and
Curzon can be together

761
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,402
the way they should be...

762
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:46,778
through Dax.

763
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:02,961
(<i> dart board beeping</i> )

764
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:16,015
He's coming!

765
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,683
(<i> Rom panting</i> )

766
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,478
He's coming.

767
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,691
(<i> sighs</i> )

768
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:31,656
Ladies and gentlemen,

769
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:35,660
I'd like to introduce
Starfleet's...

770
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,911
future...

771
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,913
my son, Nog.

772
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:49,007
Congratulations, Nog.

773
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,216
Thank you, sir.

774
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,802
Yeah, way to go.

775
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:54,262
I'm afraid
you've jumped the gun

776
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:55,721
putting on that uniform.

777
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:58,683
I know I haven't earned
the right to wear it yet,

778
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:01,436
but my father got it for me.

779
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,396
Hopefully,
you'll get to put on

780
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:04,856
the real one next year.

781
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:10,195
When you ace the Academy
Entrance Exam.

782
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:11,237
Yeah.

783
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,950
What's the matter,
Chief?

784
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,910
It just occurred to me.

785
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,704
As soon as that kid
graduates from the Academy,

786
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:21,622
I'm going to have
to call him "sir."

787
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,251
Okay.

788
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,133
What can I
get you, Nog?

789
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:34,719
Oh.

790
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:38,348
A root beer.

791
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:39,974
It's an Earth drink--

792
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,560
something they serve
at the Academy.

793
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:47,232
A root beer.

794
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:50,485
This is the end
of Ferengi civilization.

795
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:05,750
May I join you,
Lieutenant?

796
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,126
Of course.

797
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,630
(<i> sighs</i> )

798
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:17,845
I'd just like to apologize
for my behavior

799
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,055
while I was joined

800
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:20,181
with Curzon.

801
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:23,101
There's no need to apologize.

802
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,644
In a way, I'm glad it happened.

803
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,063
It forced me to deal

804
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:29,399
with some things
about myself

805
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:31,817
I've never really faced.

806
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:36,531
Besides, you've...
given me a special gift.

807
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,117
Oh?

808
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:43,329
You see...

809
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,164
now I have Curzon's memories

810
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,792
of what it felt like
to be a changeling.

811
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:52,004
I never realized
how much joy it gives you.

812
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:56,217
And I never understood
how much joy

813
00:43:56,217 --> 00:44:02,348
you humanoids experience
in things like eating, drinking,

814
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:06,060
staying up all night playing
<i>tongo.</i>

815
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,562
(<i> chuckling</i> )

816
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,522
Frankly, I don't
see how Curzon

817
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:12,233
ever managed to get
any work done.

818
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:15,861
He always seemed to somehow.

819
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,696
Well...

820
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:21,826
he must have been
a remarkable man.

821
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:25,580
Yes, he is.
