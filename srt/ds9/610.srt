1
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:17,893
Just set them on the bar.

2
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,980
Morn, no touching.

3
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:24,441
You know what this is?

4
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:27,862
Three cases of syrup of squill.

5
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:30,280
I love syrup of squill
on my groatcakes

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,783
but I haven't seen a jar
in over a year.

7
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:33,826
No one has.

8
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:35,035
ODO:
Does that mean

9
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,787
the drought on Balancar
is over?

10
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:38,956
There never<i> was</i> a drought
on Balancar.

11
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,124
It was all a ploy

12
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,002
by their agricultural
consortium.

13
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:44,920
They've been stockpiling
squill

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,714
in order to drive the price up.

15
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,549
That's dishonest.

16
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,300
I couldn't agree more.

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,346
You see, I once did business
with the nephew of the cousin

18
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,264
of the stepsister of a friend

19
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:59,852
of the secretary to the
consortium's chief accountant.

20
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:02,062
Nephew... cousin...
stepsister...

21
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,689
friend...

22
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:04,857
Yeah, that's right.

23
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:07,818
And he told me in passing

24
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:10,070
that the accountant
had bought himself

25
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,322
a very nice pair
of Ferengi rain slippers.

26
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:17,118
And if there was a drought,
he wouldn't need rain slippers.

27
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,704
My thoughts exactly.

28
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:23,208
So, I set up a meeting
with this accountant

29
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:27,504
and I told him
that he either provide me

30
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,590
with a shipment of syrup

31
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,675
or I would expose
their deception

32
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,468
to the entire Quadrant.

33
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:42,101
Tomorrow morning, we are having
a special on groatcakes

34
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:44,563
topped with syrup of squill.

35
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:45,940
(<i> excited murmuring</i> )

36
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,525
That is, for everyone
who can afford it.

37
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,527
What are you standing
around for?

38
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,362
Get these crates
into the storeroom.

39
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:55,824
This stuff is worth
its weight in latinum.

40
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,577
Which reminds me of another

41
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,079
little economic episode
of mine.

42
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,789
It happened say, oh

43
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,040
11 or 12 years ago

44
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,959
shortly before
I came on the station.

45
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,251
Dax! Julian!

46
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,335
You're back.

47
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,545
I was so worried.

48
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,255
DAX:
I told you
we'd be okay.

49
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:13,550
Then why all the secrecy
about your mission?

50
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,344
We weren't supposed
to talk about it.

51
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,638
Ah, but it's okay now.

52
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:18,847
The mission's over.

53
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,348
We've been debriefed.

54
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,810
We took the<i> Defiant</i>
behind enemy lines.

55
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,936
We're the first
reconnaissance mission

56
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,104
into Cardassian space

57
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:26,313
since the
Dominion's retreat.

58
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,731
(<i> sighs</i> )

59
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,817
Well, the first one
to make it back, anyway.

60
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:32,027
And if that isn't reason
to celebrate,

61
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,403
I don't know what is.

62
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,571
Three synthales.

63
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,739
Coming right up.

64
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,702
Something wrong,
Quark?

65
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,287
Yes, something's wrong.

66
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:46,750
A bunch of self-satisfied
Starfleet officers...

67
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,502
just stole my audience.

68
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,379
They're not<i> just</i>
Starfleet officers.

69
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,339
They're heroes.

70
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,841
Let's face it, Quark.

71
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:57,052
There's nothing heroic
about earning profit.

72
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,887
There is on Ferenginar.

73
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,931
We're not on Ferenginar.

74
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,099
(<i> chuckles</i> )

75
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,102
(<i> whispering</i> )

76
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:06,103
The Nagus...

77
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,395
calling me now?

78
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:11,733
Oh, he must have found out
about the squill.

79
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,234
I have to send him
a jar.

80
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,779
No. Better make it
a dozen.

81
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,781
He loves squill.

82
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:28,125
(<i> instrument humming</i> )

83
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,377
Oh, there you are.

84
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,420
I've been looking all over
the station for you.

85
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,381
Well, you found me.

86
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,633
Now you go hide, and
I'll search for you.

87
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,801
(<i> chuckling</i> )

88
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,136
Rom, brace yourself.

89
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,261
I have bad news.

90
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,764
Our mother's been
taken prisoner

91
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,058
by the Dominion.

92
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:46,852
Moogie...

93
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,689
a prisoner?

94
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,941
It gets worse.

95
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,819
The Nagus wants me
to rescue her.

96
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,362
You?

97
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,947
Rescue Moogie?

98
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,782
From the Dominion?

99
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,284
Yep.

100
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,829
Uh-oh.

101
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,372
"Uh-oh" is right.

102
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:11,205
So, how do you plan
on rescuing Moogie?

103
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:15,250
You mean, how do<i> we</i>
plan on rescuing Moogie?

104
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,877
I don't recall you saying
the Nagus

105
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,003
wanted<i> me</i>
to go along.

106
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,339
Maybe he doesn't,
but I do.

107
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:23,424
Besides, Ishka's
your mother, too.

108
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,635
And I love her,
but I can't go with you.

109
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,678
I'm a married man.

110
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,096
I have responsibilities

111
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,140
and my responsibilities
don't want me to die.

112
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,935
I don't want to die either,
so let's just concentrate

113
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,521
on the reward the
Nagus is offering.

114
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,647
Reward?

115
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,317
50 bars of gold-
pressed latinum.

116
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,776
50 bars?!

117
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,444
Ow.

118
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,031
Which I'm willing
to share with you.

119
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,743
An even split?

120
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,578
Absolutely!

121
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:54,622
30 bars for me
and 20 for you.

122
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,166
That's not even.

123
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:59,586
It is when you include
my finder's fee.

124
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,591
Right.

125
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:05,800
ROM:
There's one thing

126
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,302
I still don't
understand.

127
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,679
How did the Dominion
get ahold of Moogie?

128
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,266
They captured the transport ship
she was on.

129
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,558
But she's a female.

130
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,935
They're forbidden
to travel

131
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:15,894
off of Ferenginar.

132
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,271
Moogie's an exception.

133
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,314
The Nagus gave her
special dispensation

134
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:22,150
to travel to Vulcan
for her operation.

135
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,693
What operation?

136
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,529
She wanted to have
her ears raised.

137
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,948
I had no idea.

138
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,490
That she was so vain?

139
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,993
That the Nagus
could be so generous.

140
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,328
He certainly is.

141
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,332
But why is he being
so good to Moogie?

142
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,834
Brother, there's something
I need to tell you.

143
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,711
You mean, that ten
bars of latinum

144
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,005
is an overly generous
finder's fee?

145
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,382
I already know that.

146
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,509
It's about
the Nagus and Moogie.

147
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,636
What about them?

148
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,054
They're lovers.

149
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,932
No...

150
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,767
It's been going on
for over a year.

151
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:56,935
No...!

152
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:57,936
She's his secret

153
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,396
financial advisor.

154
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:02,190
She helps him run
the entire Ferengi Alliance.

155
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,191
No...!

156
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,110
Would you stop saying that?

157
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,446
(<i> sighing</i> )

158
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,284
May I help you, gentlemen?

159
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:15,287
I was following you.

160
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:18,039
We must have taken
a wrong turn.

161
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,624
It looks that way.

162
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,801
Much better.

163
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,178
(<i> groans</i> )

164
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,262
You know, Brother,

165
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,473
I've been
thinking.

166
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:36,016
We can't
rescue Moogie

167
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,892
from a Dominion
internment center.

168
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,644
Not alone, anyway.

169
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,812
You're right.

170
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,063
We'll need help.

171
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,232
We could put together
a commando team--

172
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,943
gather the toughest
mercenaries we can find--

173
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,987
Nausicaans, Breen, Klingon!

174
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,405
Shh!

175
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:53,241
We don't need Nausicaans,
Breen or Klingon.

176
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,159
Hu-mans?

177
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,120
We'll just use Ferengi.

178
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,746
Then we'll all die!

179
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,165
No, we won't!

180
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:02,334
Ferengi can be just
as tough as Klingons.

181
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:03,835
They can?
Of course they can.

182
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,796
They just need
the opportunity,

183
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,089
the training,

184
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,467
and a couple of bars
of latinum as incentive.

185
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:14,095
Coming out of<i> my</i> share,
I suppose.
No!

186
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,432
(<i> softly</i> ):
We'll split the reward
with whoever joins us--

187
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,643
all... 20 bars of it.

188
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,770
But the Nagus offered 50.

189
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,941
As far as anyone else
is concerned, he said 20.

190
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,403
20 it is, then.

191
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:38,286
Now the only question is:
Who's our first recruit?

192
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,662
Not me.

193
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,705
But Nog...

194
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,706
Moogie needs you.

195
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,291
Not to mention
your Nagus.

196
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,001
They need you,
we need you--

197
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,336
say you'll join us!

198
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,337
Please.

199
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,881
I'm a Starfleet Officer.

200
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,591
I can't go
running off with you

201
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,427
on some half-baked
rescue mission.

202
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:54,928
I have duties to perform.

203
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,721
But you know how
to fire a phaser.

204
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:57,805
Forget it, Rom.

205
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,099
Don't beg.

206
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,517
Too bad, though.

207
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,143
We were going
to make you

208
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,853
Strategic Operations
officer.

209
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,606
You mean,
like Commander Worf?

210
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,942
Exactly like
Commander Worf.

211
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,026
Think of it, Nog.

212
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,736
You'll devise
the tactics

213
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,738
come up with
a plan of action.

214
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,282
You could be the team's
drill instructor.

215
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,075
Put us through our paces,
prepare us for combat.

216
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,201
Turn us into soldiers.

217
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,745
That's a big job.

218
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,331
That's why
we need you.

219
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,458
(<i> sighs</i> )

220
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,167
How big is the team?

221
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,710
Right now?

222
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,969
(<i> chuckling</i> )

223
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:49,483
Now, remember, Leck
is not your typical Ferengi.

224
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,776
His priorities are
different than ours.

225
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,153
I understand, Brother.

226
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,779
No, you don't,
but you will.

227
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:59,033
<i>I hope</i>
<i>this is a secure channel.</i>

228
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:02,370
I followed your
instructions
to the letter.

229
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,704
<i>Mmm, very good.</i>

230
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,999
<i>Who do you want eliminated?</i>

231
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,542
It's not that kind of job.

232
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,503
<i>Then why call an Eliminator?</i>

233
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,087
What's an Eliminator?

234
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,257
Shh. I'm putting together
a little rescue mission

235
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:17,051
and I'd like you
to be part of my team.

236
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,346
<i>I work alone.</i>

237
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,679
You'll be paid in latinum.

238
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,682
<i>I don't care about latinum.</i>

239
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:24,976
You're right.

240
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,437
His priorities
are different.

241
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,771
All right.

242
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,357
Forget the latinum.

243
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,899
I've been told you
like the opportunity

244
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:32,984
to test your abilities.

245
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,738
<i>I enjoy a challenge.</i>

246
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,240
Then you should know this--

247
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,535
that the person
we're going to rescue

248
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,328
is being held
by the Dominion.

249
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,954
<i>The Dominion?</i>

250
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,582
Should be<i> quite</i> a challenge.

251
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,125
<i>Hmm.</i>

252
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:04,307
How the mighty have fallen.

253
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,851
Cousin Quark.

254
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,771
I heard you were arrested
on Thalos VI for vagrancy.

255
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,983
It's all your fault.

256
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:19,030
I was a thriving
weapons merchant...

257
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,659
until I went into business
with you.

258
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,203
You ruined me.

259
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:31,668
If I ever get out of here,
Cousin,

260
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:35,213
I'll make you pay
for what you did to me.

261
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,803
Lower the force field.

262
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,684
Now, what exactly is it
you were going to do to me?

263
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:50,186
I don't understand.

264
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,188
Quark paid your fine.

265
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,690
You're a free man.

266
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,237
What do I have
to do in return?

267
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,697
Earn some latinum.

268
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,285
Tell me more.

269
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,217
On the bar you will find a padd

270
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:26,180
with the schematic of
a Dominion internment center.

271
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,267
You may now examine
the schematic.

272
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:46,242
How can we be sure
these schematics are accurate?

273
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,994
Sir.

274
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,538
Oh, no need to stand
on formality here.

275
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,081
Just call me Leck.

276
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,833
No, I meant
<i>you</i> should call<i> me</i> "sir."

277
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,294
Don't be ridiculous.

278
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,463
You mean "Don't be
ridiculous,<i> sir."</i>

279
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,673
Gentlemen,
please.

280
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:00,965
Let's not
squabble.

281
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,134
We're a team, Nog.

282
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,469
We're a team,<i> sir.</i>

283
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,012
Stay out of this.
Listen to me, Nog...

284
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,846
That's it. I quit.

285
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,098
You can't quit.

286
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,850
This is<i> not</i> a game.

287
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,936
How are we
supposed to get

288
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,981
to this "internment
center," anyway?

289
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:17,940
By ship.

290
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,360
Do we have a ship?

291
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,902
We'll get one.

292
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,279
We don't have a ship?

293
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,072
I said, we'll get one!
How?

294
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,157
We'll find one.

295
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,074
Where?

296
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,951
I don't know!

297
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,495
Think of it
as a challenge.

298
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:31,912
(<i> applause</i> )

299
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,377
Liquidator Brunt!

300
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,212
That's ex-Liquidator Brunt.

301
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,755
Thanks to your brother,

302
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:43,758
I'm no longer with
the Ferengi Commerce Authority.

303
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,760
(<i> sinister chuckling</i> )

304
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,807
A child...

305
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,809
a moron...

306
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,227
a failure...

307
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,521
and a psychopath.

308
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:59,649
Quite a little<i> team</i>
you put together.

309
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:00,900
What do you want, Brunt?

310
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,318
I'm here to sign up.

311
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,696
I'm going to help you
rescue your mother.

312
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,364
QUARK:
What?

313
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,408
How do you know
about Moogie?

314
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,035
I know a lot of things.

315
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,580
Ah... you think if you
help save my mother,

316
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,123
the Nagus will give you
your old job back.

317
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,542
When do we leave?

318
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,252
We're not leaving.

319
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,961
Not with you.

320
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,297
That's one thing
we can<i> all</i> agree on.

321
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,717
Nobody likes Liquidators.

322
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:28,177
Or even ex-Liquidators.

323
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,637
The team has spoken.

324
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:33,641
Besides, there's a 20-bar
reward to consider.

325
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,853
Better to split it
five ways than six.

326
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,688
Fine.

327
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:43,359
I'll just get in my ship
and leave.

328
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,782
Did you say ship?

329
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,200
That's right.

330
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,121
Why?

331
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,504
Now we are six.

332
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,523
Don't move!

333
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,191
You're surrounded.

00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,218
I think we're
getting better.

346
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,303
No, you're not.

347
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,972
This is the eighth run-through

348
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:57,141
and you haven't been able
to hit a single Jem'Hadar.

349
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,476
And you shot Moogie!

350
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,728
I saw we weren't
going to rescue her

351
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,647
so I put her out
of her misery.

352
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,273
Who invited him along?

353
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,861
Maybe we should start off
with something easier.

354
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,153
Like what?

355
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,238
Like ambushing
a couple of Bolians.

356
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,657
You couldn't ambush a Bolian

357
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,534
if he was blindfolded
and tied to a tree!

358
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,495
QUARK:
That's enough!

359
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,205
Get out of here,
all of you.

360
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,832
You heard me.

361
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,917
Go.

362
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,967
But, Brother, don't you want
to keep practicing?

363
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,802
We're wasting our time, Rom.

364
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,388
We couldn't get
anywhere near Moogie,

365
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,806
let alone rescue her.

366
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,683
I guess we're
not cut out

367
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,434
to be heroes after all.

368
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,435
And to think,

369
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,063
just a few short days ago,

370
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,734
I was sitting
on top of the world.

371
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,485
The King of Squill.

372
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,779
You should have been there,
Brother.

373
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,740
It was a very delicate
negotiation.

374
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,118
It could've gone either way,
but I took my time,

375
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,955
picked my moment,
and then...

376
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,456
went in for the kill.

377
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,500
It was beautiful
to behold.

378
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,128
Brother...

379
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:11,215
I think we've been going
about this the wrong way.

380
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,717
We're not commandos.

381
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,218
We're negotiators.

382
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,261
We make deals.

383
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,471
That's what we're good at.

384
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,266
The Dominion has something
<i>we</i> want

385
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:23,728
so we need to find something
<i>they</i> want...

386
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,605
And then we make a trade!

387
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,357
That way,
everyone goes home happy.

388
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,109
Happy and alive.

389
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,780
Now, what do we have
to trade?

390
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,994
Captain, I can't thank you
enough for all your help.

391
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,037
Don't thank me.

392
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,246
Thank Major Kira.

393
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,707
She's the one
that convinced me

394
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,459
to talk to Starfleet
on your behalf.

395
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,752
Consider it payback, Quark

396
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,879
for rescuing me
from the Dominion.

397
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:53,091
SISKO: Breaking you out of
the station's holding cell
is one thing.

398
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:55,259
What you're planning to do
is considerably more dangerous.

399
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,846
Every negotiation has
its share of danger, Captain.

400
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,723
If you say so.

401
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,936
I guess it's time for me
to pick up my prisoner.

402
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:08,397
Just be careful you don't
turn your back on him, Quark.

403
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,774
He's not to be trusted.

404
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,776
Neither am I.

405
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:25,665
Excuse me.

406
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,541
Ah!

407
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,459
Sorry.

408
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:29,460
This isn't a ship.

409
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,670
It's a closet.

410
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,964
If you don't like it
here, leave.

411
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:34,590
I'll go.

412
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,926
That way there'll be more room
for the rest of you.

413
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,512
Besides, this isn't
a rescue mission anymore.

414
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,055
It's a simple prisoner exchange.

415
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,016
I don't know why
Quark needs any of us.

416
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,685
Because he doesn't trust
the Dominion.

417
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:46,978
And neither do I.

418
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:48,562
BRUNT:
Why would the Dominion

419
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,065
pick a deserted Cardassian
space station

420
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,817
to make the trade?

421
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,902
They didn't pick it, Quark did.

422
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,195
I've been there.

423
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,364
It's the same design
as Deep Space 9

424
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,615
so we know the layout.

425
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,368
Well, you have nothing
to worry about.

426
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,872
You'll have plenty of places
to run and hide.

427
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,414
(<i> Leck laughs</i> )

428
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,001
Everyone,

429
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,752
this is Keevan.

430
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,379
We're going to trade him
for Ishka.

431
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,840
Hi.

432
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,216
I'm Rom.

433
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,885
This is Nog.

434
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,094
That's Brunt...

435
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,345
QUARK:
Rom...

436
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,889
he doesn't care.

437
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:26,350
Truer words have
never been spoken.

438
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,727
I'll advise you all

439
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,354
to send final messages
to your loved ones

440
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,315
and make sure your
wills are in order.

441
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,608
Why?

442
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,276
Because the moment
we leave this station

443
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,404
you'll have signed
your death warrants.

444
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,532
KEEVAN:
Now if you don't mind

445
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,201
I'm going
to take a nap.

446
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,378
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

447
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,630
All clear!

448
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,381
QUARK:
Are you sure?

449
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:42,885
Tricorder indicates no other
life-forms on the station.

450
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,275
NOG:
All right.

451
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:58,901
Let's head for base camp.

452
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,569
"Base camp"?

453
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,946
He means the Infirmary.

454
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,281
It's right over there.

455
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:05,992
Come on. Let's move it.
On the double!

456
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:09,203
Well, what are
you waiting for?

457
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:10,663
Two slips
of latinum

458
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,331
for the first man
who makes it
to the Infirmary.

459
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,214
I mean "base camp."

460
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:21,632
You don't pay
your soldiers

461
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:22,675
to do their duty.

462
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:25,094
You do if they're Ferengi.

463
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,766
Great! Another closet.

464
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:36,563
NOG:
We've chosen this spot
for a reason.

465
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:39,108
For one thing,
it's a confined area

466
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,027
with only two
ways in or out--

467
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,778
this one, and
that one over there.

468
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,696
Secondly,

469
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:44,905
it's near the airlock

470
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,199
which gives us
access to our ship

471
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,908
and third,
it's on the Promenade

472
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,410
where the prisoner exchange
will take place.

473
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,495
Don't touch that.

474
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,788
Some of this
medical equipment

475
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:53,873
is still functioning.

476
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,083
Anything for
an upset stomach?

477
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,960
What<i> you</i> need
is a new backbone.

478
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,337
GAILA:
Hey!

479
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,630
I'm a weapons dealer,
not a soldier.

480
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,049
Cousin!

481
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:05,301
Sir, may I suggest we set up
our defense perimeter?

482
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,635
Good idea.

483
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,386
How much is this
going to cost me?

484
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:09,972
Don't worry.
No charge.

485
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:11,098
Starfleet
has really

486
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,641
corrupted you,
hasn't it?

487
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,310
You could start by getting

488
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,312
the external sensors
back on line.

489
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,564
I want to know the minute
a Dominion ship

490
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,025
gets within ten million
kilometers of this station.

491
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,069
I'll set up
a transport jamming signal.

492
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:25,029
That way,
the Dominion won't be able

493
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:27,489
to beam our prisoner away
without our say-so.

494
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,492
We certainly wouldn't
want that to happen, would we?

495
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,452
You don't seem
to be too happy

496
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:35,248
at the prospect of
rejoining your people.

497
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,957
Believe me
when I tell you

498
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,918
I have nothing
to be happy about.

499
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,461
Vorta are supposed
to commit suicide

500
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,880
when they're captured.

501
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,093
I failed to follow
that rather... harsh policy.

502
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:48,135
(<i> chuckles</i> )

503
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,096
So they're going to execute you?

504
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:53,307
After what is
surely going to be

505
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:56,143
a most unpleasant
debriefing.

506
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,896
I'm sorry to hear about that,
but it's not my problem.

507
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,731
All I want is my Moogie back.

508
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:03,276
By the time the Dominion
is done with you,

509
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:04,944
all you'll want...

510
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,904
is a quick... death.

511
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:09,823
Take him in the next room
and see that he stays there.

512
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,909
We'll post a guard
on him at all times.

513
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:13,493
Four hour shifts.

514
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,912
You heard him. Move.

515
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:17,039
Perhaps you can help me
clarify something.

516
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,707
What's the most
vulnerable part

517
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,334
of a Jem'Hadar's
body, hmm?

518
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:22,169
All right.
You have your orders.

519
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,587
Let's get to work.

00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:26,924

Who's screaming?

The Vorta--
where is he?

529
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,197
I don't know.

530
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,407
What do you mean
you don't know?

531
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:52,450
You were guarding him!

532
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,409
He must have slipped away

533
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:54,994
while I was sleeping.

534
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,745
Sleeping?!
Who said you could sleep?

535
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:57,830
I couldn't help it.

536
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,039
I was tired.

537
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,540
I couldn't get any rest
on the ship.

538
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,875
The ship...

539
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:05,212
if Keevan gets away,
we're finished!

Going someplace?

00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,083
Apparently not.

I couldn't get
the impulse engines on line.

544
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,880
That's because
I had Rom

545
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,174
disengage the
induction matrix.

546
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,718
Then why did you
bother chasing me?

547
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:56,972
Because sometimes
my brother gets things wrong.

548
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,265
(<i> chuckles</i> )

549
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,558
(<i> panting</i> )

550
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,647
All right,
everyone relax.

551
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,149
No harm done.

552
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,692
We still have
our prisoner.

553
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,027
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

554
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,028
What's that?!

555
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,279
It's the alarm I set up.

556
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,323
It means a Dominion ship
is approaching.

557
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,658
To the
Infirmary!

558
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,784
Let's go!

559
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:35,135
(<i> yells</i> )

560
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,763
(<i> alarm continues</i> )

561
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,575
(<i> alarm stops</i> )

562
00:26:57,575 --> 00:26:59,243
Now what?

563
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:01,579
Someone turned
the alarm off.

564
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:03,581
Maybe it went
off by itself.

565
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,585
Do you hear
something?

566
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:09,587
Someone's out there.

567
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:11,171
BRUNT:
One of us

568
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,299
should go check
to make sure.

569
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:14,841
I nominate Quark.

570
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:15,801
Me?

571
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,011
I'll go.

572
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:41,994
Firing line take aim.

573
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,463
Anybody there?

574
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,132
You could say that.

575
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,190
I wonder what they're
doing out there.

576
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,484
Shh.
I don't hear
anything.

577
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:14,443
Quiet.

578
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:15,611
Why are
we hiding?

579
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,197
There are Jem'Hadar
out there.

580
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,739
Of course
they're out there.

581
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,659
We asked them to come.

582
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,118
He's right.

583
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,996
Everything's going
according to plan.

584
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,623
Now, all you have
to do, Quark,

585
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,500
is negotiate
the prisoner exchange.

586
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,168
Remember,
be firm,<i> strong.</i>

587
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:33,753
But don't get
them angry.

588
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,255
Good luck,
Brother.

589
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,965
Say "Hi" to
Moogie for me.

590
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,467
What if it's a trap?

591
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,344
Of course
it's a trap.

592
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,721
They're not here
to negotiate.

593
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,391
They're here
to kill us all.

594
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:46,350
You think?

595
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,685
BRUNT:
Don't listen to him.

596
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:49,936
He's just trying
to save his own neck.

597
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:52,064
I'm trying to save
all our necks.

598
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:54,149
VORTA:
Ferengi, show yourself.

599
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,569
We're here to trade.

600
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,028
Don't go out there.

601
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,322
We must get
back to the ship.

602
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,575
Our only hope
is to escape.

603
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:05,536
We're not going anywhere--
not without Moogie.

604
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:06,953
Right, Uncle?

605
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:11,375
Right.

606
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:12,543
VORTA:
Ferengi

607
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:14,211
I don't like
to be kept waiting.

608
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:15,962
I'm coming.

609
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,756
I'm coming!

610
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,885
And you two are coming with me.

611
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:25,222
I was afraid he was
going to say that.

612
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:27,182
Rom...

613
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,353
Moogie!

614
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,021
My boys.

615
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,732
I knew you'd come.

616
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:19,151
You look beautiful.

617
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:22,821
My lobes haven't
been this firm
in over a century.

618
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,949
I guess<i> that</i>
makes all<i> this</i> worthwhile.

619
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,702
Don't you start
with me, Quark.

620
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,712
What a touching
and heartfelt reunion.

621
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:41,715
I'm glad I was
here to witness it.

622
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,509
Now, where's Keevan?

623
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:46,970
I wish to conclude
this transaction.

624
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,055
All in good time,

625
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:52,851
but first,
I need some assurances.

626
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,395
What kind of assurances?

627
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,272
Well, for one thing,

628
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,859
I don't want<i> any Jem'Hadar</i>
soldiers on this station.

629
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:04,488
That would leave me
in a very vulnerable position.

630
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:06,657
One Vorta against six Ferengi.

631
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:09,951
If it makes you feel better,
these two can stay.

632
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,662
I feel safer already.

633
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:13,330
Now, where's Keevan?

634
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,374
Hold on, I'm not done yet.

635
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:18,502
Then, you're going to tell
your helmsman

636
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:22,631
to head back to Dominion
territory-- warp nine.

637
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:25,967
That would leave me
stranded here.

638
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,260
For a few days.

639
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,428
I see

640
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,472
and by the time
they return,

641
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:31,931
you'll be long gone.

642
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,433
That's the idea.

643
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,268
VORTA:
On the other hand,

644
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,978
I could have my Jem'Hadar

645
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,231
storm the Infirmary
and kill you all.

646
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,816
I like our plan better.

647
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,234
You attack
the Infirmary,

648
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,319
and Keevan will be
the first to die.

649
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,864
Keevan's fate
has already been sealed.

650
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:52,578
Maybe, but before he dies,
I'll bet you'll want to know

651
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:55,372
what Dominion secrets
he's revealed to the Federation.

652
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,458
He's got you there, Yelgrun.

653
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:07,217
Your people have
a reputation for cunning.

654
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,762
I see that it's well-earned.

655
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:12,639
Perhaps one day,

656
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,349
the Ferengi will
take their place

657
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,477
as valued members
of the Dominion.

658
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:20,021
Anything's possible.

659
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:24,192
I will begin to evacuate
the Jem'Hadar at once.

660
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:27,696
We can exchange the prisoners
in, let's say, half an hour?

661
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,239
We'll be waiting.

662
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:32,618
One more thing.

663
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,119
How do we know

664
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,329
that's really Moogie
and not a changeling?

665
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,499
I think that uniform
is too tight on you, Nog.

666
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,502
It's cutting off circulation
to your brain.

667
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,254
Sounds like Moogie.

668
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:48,842
Only one way
to find out.

669
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:50,719
Wait.

670
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:52,930
This should
be interesting.

671
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,977
Ow!

672
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,146
Yeah. That's blood all right.

673
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,773
I knew it was Moogie.

674
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:06,860
Now let's see if
you're a changeling.

675
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,904
That's no way
to tell if he's a changeling.

676
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:10,447
You're right.

677
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,282
Give me that knife.

678
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:14,367
I don't think so.

679
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,828
Family...

680
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:17,370
you understand.

681
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,538
Not really.

682
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,748
I was cloned.

683
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:22,292
No parents?

684
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:23,961
That explains a lot.

685
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:26,505
No parents, no sweetheart.

686
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,841
No investment portfolio.

687
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:30,091
And no patience.

688
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:33,261
We'll meet back here
in one half hour.

689
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,555
Don't be late.

690
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,223
You heard him, Quark.

691
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,434
Rom, I'm counting on you.

692
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,896
Remember-- Moogie
loves you.

693
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,817
(<i> all laughing</i> )

694
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:50,362
You should have
seen my brother.

695
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:51,697
He was<i> brilliant.</i>

696
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,198
NOG:
In a half hour

697
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:56,827
we'll have Moogie back
and we can all go home.

698
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:58,328
(<i> all sigh</i> )

699
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:03,750
Home... to the torrential rains
of Ferenginar.

700
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,168
You know what
I miss most?

701
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,629
The rotting
vegetation.

702
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:08,672
Yep.

703
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,632
And the dampness.

704
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:15,053
Oh, to stand once more
in those rivers of muck.

705
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,931
Oh, I only wish I
could be there with you.

706
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,517
(<i> all chuckling</i> )

707
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:21,935
I can't believe it.

708
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:24,563
We're actually going
to get the reward money.

709
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:26,773
50 bars of gold-
pressed latinum.

710
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:29,234
50 bars? You said
the reward was 20.

711
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,610
That's what
Rom said. 20.

712
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,153
He said 50.

713
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,948
I thought you said you
didn't care about latinum.

714
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:37,283
I don't! I just don't
like to be cheated.

715
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,869
Everyone
calm down.

716
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:41,955
Calm down? When my dear cousin
is trying to cheat me?

717
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:43,373
I'm not trying
to cheat anyone.

718
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:44,791
Then what about
the other 30 bars?!

719
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,711
There are no other
30 bars... are there?

720
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,295
Uh... no,
not really.

721
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,714
LECK:
He's lying.

722
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:52,131
They're in it together.

723
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,967
You're not going to get
away with this, Quark!

724
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:56,845
I come here, risk my
life, and for what?!

725
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:59,598
You've had this coming
for a long time, Cousin!

726
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,099
(<i> shrieking</i> )

727
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,642
Look out!

728
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:10,025
I hate Ferengi.

729
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:31,337
You idiot.

730
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,062
What are we
going to do?

731
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,106
We can't have
a prisoner exchange

732
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:50,607
without a prisoner.

733
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:51,817
If they find out
Keevan's dead,

734
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:52,985
they're going
to kill us.

735
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:54,069
Will you stop
saying that?

736
00:35:56,237 --> 00:36:00,575
Maybe, if we surrender,
they won't hurt us.

737
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,620
I have a better idea.

738
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,205
Let's sneak back to my ship
and try to escape.

739
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,000
It's a big station...

740
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,208
easy to get lost in.

741
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,086
If we hide,
maybe they won't find us.

742
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,796
No one's hiding
and no one's escaping

743
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,048
and no one's surrendering.

744
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:17,926
What's wrong
with you people?

745
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:20,512
Have you forgotten
the Battle of Prexnak?

746
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,972
Who could forget

747
00:36:21,972 --> 00:36:24,724
the most important battle
in Ferengi history?!

748
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:29,187
Ten Ferengi stood alone
against 273 Lytasians.

749
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:33,483
As I recall, all ten Ferengi
were slaughtered.

750
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:35,110
The point is,

751
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,820
we Ferengi
are just as tough

752
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,237
as anyone
in the galaxy.

753
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:41,282
And this is our chance
to prove it...

754
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,868
once and for all.

755
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,914
LECK:
Quark's right.

756
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,000
Let's do it for Ishka.

757
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,669
Let's do it
for the Grand Nagus.

758
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:55,505
Let's do it
for Ferengis everywhere!

759
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,549
Let's do it
for equal shares

760
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:01,219
of 50 bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

761
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,387
It always comes
down to profit

762
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:04,263
with you people,
doesn't it?

763
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,183
We're Ferengi.

764
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:09,394
And that's why I love you!

765
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:12,731
50 bars it is...

766
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:15,233
minus my usual finder's fee.

767
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,695
Well, there's no doubt about it.

768
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:22,407
According to these readings,
this man is dead.

769
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:24,701
Thank you, Dr. Nog.

770
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:26,870
I just wanted to be sure.

771
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,454
I thought maybe

772
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:31,917
we could revive him,
but I guess not.

773
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:34,586
He's alive!

774
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:35,795
No, he isn't.

775
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,215
It's just the neural stimulator.

776
00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:41,968
It caused a reflexive impulse
in his cerebellum.

777
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,970
I never knew you studied
medicine at the Academy.

778
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,056
I didn't,
but if you think about it,

779
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:48,850
medicine isn't that different
from engineering.

780
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,310
It's all about
keeping things running.

781
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,771
Fixing broken parts.

782
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:56,357
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

783
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,610
Find me more
neural stimulators!

784
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,319
YELGRUN:
It's time, Ferengi.

785
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,114
Bring out
your prisoner.

786
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:03,740
Stall them, Uncle.

787
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,200
I'll try.

788
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:12,249
YELGRUN:
I've done
as you asked.

789
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:13,917
The Jem'Hadar are
on their way

790
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:15,334
back to Dominion
territory.

791
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,087
We are alone
on the station.

792
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:18,296
Wonderful.

793
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,048
Now bring out Keevan

794
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:23,176
and we can conclude
our business.

795
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:25,470
Keevan. Right. Absolutely.

796
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,389
I'm waiting.

797
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,058
He'll be right out.

798
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,601
But first...

799
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:34,479
my brother has to run
some sensor scans

800
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:38,108
to make sure the Jem'Hadar
have really left.

801
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:39,609
That is unnecessary.

802
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:41,527
The Jem'Hadar are gone.

803
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,113
Now bring me Keevan.

804
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:45,115
I will, in a few minutes.

805
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:48,285
No, not in a few minutes.
<i>Now!</i>

806
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:50,120
Or maybe
you've changed your mind

807
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,330
and you don't want
your mother back.

808
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,623
Kill her.

809
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:54,666
No!

810
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,252
Give them what they want, Quark.

811
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,419
I intend to.

812
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,921
Excellent.

813
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:03,967
As soon as my brother completes
his sensor scans.

814
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:08,305
And I thought the Breen
were annoying.

815
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,185
Very well.

816
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:15,478
Five minutes...

817
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:19,858
but I will not tolerate
any more delays.

818
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,734
Neither will I.

819
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:25,113
That goes for me, too.

820
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:28,241
You see, we're all in agreement.

821
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:33,205
Um...

822
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:36,916
one more thing.

823
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:40,086
Why am I not surprised?

824
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,713
The prisoner exchange...

825
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:45,091
I'd like for it to take place
outside Airlock 3.

826
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,593
What's wrong with the Promenade?

827
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,179
Nothing,

828
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:53,183
except my ship is docked
at Airlock 3.

829
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:54,475
You understand.

830
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:57,395
Only too well,

831
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,398
but I must say your lack
of trust saddens me.

832
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,400
Ah, well...

833
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,986
a sign of the times.

834
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:12,660
Nog, you have five minutes.

835
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,246
All right.
Here we go.

836
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,915
(<i> all gasp</i> )

837
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,503
(<i> laughing</i> )

838
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:32,264
7,500 lots of
hypicate futures?

839
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:34,640
The hypicate root
is very versatile.

840
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,809
It's used in
certain medicines,

841
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,103
diffractive optics,

842
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:40,188
and even some
beauty supplies.

843
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,690
Here, feel how
smooth my head is.

844
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:44,859
Cream of hypicate.

845
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,819
I apply it twice a day.

846
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,572
You see, a diversified
financial portfolio

847
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:53,034
can mean greater profits
<i>and</i> healthier-looking skin.

848
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:54,327
Fascinating.

849
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:55,787
I'd love to hear more,

850
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:58,164
but if your son
doesn't show up soon,

851
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:01,042
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to kill you.

852
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,878
QUARK:
Yelgrun!

853
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,922
You ready?

854
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:07,465
I've been ready for hours.

855
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,009
On a count of three,
we release our prisoners.

856
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,177
Agreed?

857
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,012
Agreed.

858
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,806
One...

859
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,933
two...

860
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:18,977
three.

861
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:53,219
What have they done to him?

862
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,931
(<i> quietly</i> ):
Straighten him out.

863
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,516
Straighten him out.

864
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,018
I'm trying.

865
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,625
Stop them!

866
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,252
(<i> grunting</i> )

867
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,337
(<i> door opens</i> )

868
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:37,805
Would you please
turn him off?

869
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:38,973
I can't.

870
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,599
The transceiver
is jammed.

871
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,060
Oh, Quark

872
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,230
the Grand Nagus is going
to be so proud of you.

873
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,647
I know I am.

874
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,441
(<i> approaching footsteps</i> )

875
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:50,360
Moogie...

876
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,950
What do we do
with this one?

877
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,370
We'll take him
with us.

878
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,247
He'll be our gift
to Starfleet.

879
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:03,956
They gave us a Vorta,
we'll give them one.

880
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,666
Ferengi...

881
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,293
I know, I know... you hate us.

882
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,920
All right, you--

883
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,338
get moving!

884
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:17,262
This is the sloppiest,
most amateurish operation

885
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:19,180
I've ever seen.

886
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,434
If you ever do something
like this again,

887
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:23,935
count me in.

888
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:25,895
You'll be the first one I call.

889
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:31,150
If I even<i> think</i> about doing
something like this again,

890
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,693
shoot me.

891
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,574
So, Brother,

892
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:40,535
how does it feel
to be a...<i> hero?</i>

893
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,037
You tell me.

894
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:48,084
It feels...

895
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:49,085
good?

896
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:50,962
(<i> laughing</i> )

897
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:56,468
You<i> bet</i> it does.
