1
00:00:17,198 --> 00:00:19,135
Just set them on the bar.

2
00:00:20,374 --> 00:00:22,242
Morn, no touching.

3
00:00:23,247 --> 00:00:25,685
You know what this is?

4
00:00:25,721 --> 00:00:29,185
Three cases of syrup of squill.

5
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,634
I love syrup of squill
on my groatcakes

6
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,108
but I haven't seen a jar
in over a year.

7
00:00:34,143 --> 00:00:35,134
No one has.

8
00:00:35,178 --> 00:00:36,340
Does that mean

9
00:00:36,382 --> 00:00:38,182
the drought on Balancar is over?

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,248
There never was a drought
on Balancar.

11
00:00:40,325 --> 00:00:42,524
It was all a ploy

12
00:00:42,564 --> 00:00:44,432
by their agricultural
consortium.

13
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:48,070
They've been stockpiling squill
in order to drive the price up.

14
00:00:48,112 --> 00:00:50,140
That's dishonest.

15
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:51,710
I couldn't agree more.

16
00:00:51,755 --> 00:00:55,697
You see, I once did business
with the nephew of the cousin

17
00:00:55,732 --> 00:00:57,703
of the stepsister of a friend

18
00:00:57,737 --> 00:01:01,304
of the secretary to the
consortium's chief accountant.

19
00:01:01,346 --> 00:01:03,340
Nephew... cousin...
stepsister...

20
00:01:03,385 --> 00:01:04,980
friend...

21
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,151
Yeah, that's right.

22
00:01:06,193 --> 00:01:09,190
And he told me in passing

23
00:01:09,234 --> 00:01:11,398
that the accountant
had bought himself

24
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,707
a very nice pair
of Ferengi rain slippers.

25
00:01:13,746 --> 00:01:18,453
And if there was a drought,
he wouldn't need rain slippers.

26
00:01:18,491 --> 00:01:20,121
My thoughts exactly.

27
00:01:20,162 --> 00:01:24,629
So, I set up a meeting
with this accountant

28
00:01:24,673 --> 00:01:28,810
and I told him
that he either provide me

29
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:30,981
with a shipment of syrup

30
00:01:31,023 --> 00:01:32,994
or I would expose
their deception

31
00:01:33,029 --> 00:01:34,761
to the entire Quadrant.

32
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:43,453
Tomorrow morning, we are having
a special on groatcakes

33
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:46,018
topped with syrup of squill.

34
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,964
That is, for everyone
who can afford it.

35
00:01:50,006 --> 00:01:51,943
What are you standing
around for?

36
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:54,348
Get these crates
into the storeroom.

37
00:01:54,384 --> 00:01:57,222
This stuff is worth
its weight in latinum.

38
00:01:57,258 --> 00:01:59,958
Which reminds me of another

39
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:01,400
little economic episode of mine.

40
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:04,443
It happened say, oh,
11 or 12 years ago

41
00:02:04,477 --> 00:02:06,277
shortly before I
came on the station.

42
00:02:06,315 --> 00:02:07,579
Dax! Julian!

43
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:08,815
You're back.

44
00:02:08,855 --> 00:02:10,085
I was so worried.

45
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,119
I told you we'd be okay.

46
00:02:12,163 --> 00:02:15,001
Then why all the secrecy
about your mission?

47
00:02:15,038 --> 00:02:17,670
We weren't supposed
to talk about it.

48
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:19,010
Ah, but it's okay now.

49
00:02:19,048 --> 00:02:20,312
The mission's over.

50
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:21,752
We've been debriefed.

51
00:02:21,788 --> 00:02:24,386
We took the <i>Defiant</i>
behind enemy lines.

52
00:02:24,429 --> 00:02:25,898
We're the first
reconnaissance mission

53
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:28,063
into Cardassian space
since the Dominion's retreat.

54
00:02:29,141 --> 00:02:31,203
Well, the first one
to make it back, anyway.

55
00:02:31,247 --> 00:02:33,411
And if that isn't reason
to celebrate

56
00:02:33,452 --> 00:02:34,751
I don't know what is.

57
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:35,883
Three synthales.

58
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:37,053
Coming right up.

59
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,098
Something wrong, Quark?

60
00:02:42,141 --> 00:02:43,667
Yes, something's wrong.

61
00:02:43,713 --> 00:02:48,089
A bunch of self-satisfied
Starfleet officers...

62
00:02:48,124 --> 00:02:49,992
just stole my audience.

63
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:52,935
They're not just
Starfleet officers.

64
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:53,960
They're heroes.

65
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:55,373
Let's face it, Quark.

66
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:58,406
There's nothing heroic
about earning profit.

67
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,284
There is on Ferenginar.

68
00:03:00,322 --> 00:03:02,293
We're not on Ferenginar.

69
00:03:06,638 --> 00:03:07,607
The Nagus...

70
00:03:07,641 --> 00:03:08,769
calling me now?

71
00:03:08,811 --> 00:03:13,118
Oh, he must have found out
about the squill.

72
00:03:13,156 --> 00:03:14,625
I have to send him a jar.

73
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:17,131
No. Better make it a dozen.

74
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,103
He loves squill.

75
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:31,833
Oh, there you are.

76
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,841
I've been looking all over
the station for you.

77
00:03:33,876 --> 00:03:35,847
Well, you found me.

78
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:37,977
Now you go hide,
and I'll search for you.

79
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:40,488
Rom, brace yourself.

80
00:03:40,526 --> 00:03:41,722
I have bad news.

81
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:45,431
Our mother's been taken prisoner
by the Dominion.

82
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:48,204
Moogie...

83
00:03:50,753 --> 00:03:52,052
a prisoner?

84
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,392
It gets worse.

85
00:03:54,428 --> 00:03:57,230
The Nagus wants me
to rescue her.

86
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,762
You?

87
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:00,401
Rescue Moogie?

88
00:04:00,444 --> 00:04:02,108
From the Dominion?

89
00:04:03,553 --> 00:04:04,613
Yep.

90
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,150
Uh-oh.

91
00:04:07,196 --> 00:04:08,688
"Uh-oh" is right.

92
00:06:07,977 --> 00:06:11,942
So, how do you plan
on rescuing Moogie?

93
00:06:11,987 --> 00:06:15,952
You mean, how do we
plan on rescuing Moogie?

94
00:06:15,998 --> 00:06:17,628
I don't recall you saying
the Nagus

95
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:18,797
wanted me to go along.

96
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,141
Maybe he doesn't, but I do.

97
00:06:21,178 --> 00:06:24,152
Besides, Ishka's your mother,
too.

98
00:06:24,186 --> 00:06:26,658
And I love her,
but I can't go with you.

99
00:06:26,693 --> 00:06:27,662
I'm a married man.

100
00:06:27,695 --> 00:06:28,823
I have responsibilities

101
00:06:28,865 --> 00:06:30,995
and my responsibilities
don't want me to die.

102
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:34,706
I don't want to die either,
so let's just concentrate

103
00:06:34,747 --> 00:06:37,219
on the reward
the Nagus is offering.

104
00:06:37,254 --> 00:06:38,314
Reward?

105
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,022
50 bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

106
00:06:41,097 --> 00:06:42,532
50 bars?!

107
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:44,299
Ow.

108
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:46,810
Which I'm willing
to share with you.

109
00:06:48,448 --> 00:06:50,476
An even split?

110
00:06:50,521 --> 00:06:52,389
Absolutely!

111
00:06:52,426 --> 00:06:55,400
30 bars for me and 20 for you.

112
00:06:55,434 --> 00:06:57,029
That's not even.

113
00:06:57,071 --> 00:07:00,375
It is when you include
my finder's fee.

114
00:07:02,452 --> 00:07:05,392
Right.

115
00:07:05,427 --> 00:07:07,991
There's one thing
I still don't understand.

116
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:10,403
How did the Dominion
get ahold of Moogie?

117
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,038
They captured the transport ship
she was on.

118
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,379
But she's a female.

119
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,888
They're forbidden to travel
off of Ferenginar.

120
00:07:16,923 --> 00:07:18,051
Moogie's an exception.

121
00:07:18,093 --> 00:07:20,064
The Nagus gave her
special dispensation

122
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:22,900
to travel to Vulcan
for her operation.

123
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:24,408
What operation?

124
00:07:24,442 --> 00:07:27,314
She wanted to have
her ears raised.

125
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,683
I had no idea.

126
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,280
That she was so vain?

127
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,728
That the Nagus
could be so generous.

128
00:07:32,764 --> 00:07:34,290
He certainly is.

129
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:38,103
But why is he being
so good to Moogie?

130
00:07:38,145 --> 00:07:40,674
Brother, there's something
I need to tell you.

131
00:07:40,718 --> 00:07:42,689
You mean, that ten
bars of latinum

132
00:07:42,723 --> 00:07:44,785
is an overly generous
finder's fee?

133
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:46,162
I already know that.

134
00:07:47,836 --> 00:07:49,305
It's about the Nagus and Moogie.

135
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:50,469
What about them?

136
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,911
They're lovers.

137
00:07:51,947 --> 00:07:54,853
No...

138
00:07:54,888 --> 00:07:56,620
It's been going on
for over a year.

139
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:57,855
No!

140
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:00,333
She's his secret
financial advisor.

141
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:03,001
She helps him run
the entire Ferengi Alliance.

142
00:08:03,043 --> 00:08:04,012
No!

143
00:08:04,045 --> 00:08:05,879
Would you stop saying that?

144
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:13,063
May I help you, gentlemen?

145
00:08:13,102 --> 00:08:16,099
I was following you.

146
00:08:16,144 --> 00:08:18,844
We must have taken a wrong turn.

147
00:08:18,884 --> 00:08:20,514
It looks that way.

148
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,610
Much better.

149
00:08:32,018 --> 00:08:35,459
You know, Brother,
I've been thinking.

150
00:08:35,493 --> 00:08:38,729
We can't rescue Moogie from
a Dominion internment center.

151
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,535
Not alone, anyway.

152
00:08:40,574 --> 00:08:41,770
You're right.

153
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:42,904
We'll need help.

154
00:08:42,946 --> 00:08:45,110
We could put together
a commando team...

155
00:08:45,152 --> 00:08:47,750
gather the toughest
mercenaries we can find...

156
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:50,196
Nausicaans, Breen, Klingon!

157
00:08:50,232 --> 00:08:51,394
Shh!

158
00:08:51,435 --> 00:08:54,067
We don't need Nausicaans,
Breen or Klingon.

159
00:08:54,108 --> 00:08:55,077
Hu-mans?

160
00:08:55,111 --> 00:08:58,017
We'll just use Ferengi.

161
00:08:58,052 --> 00:09:00,114
Then we'll all die!

162
00:09:00,157 --> 00:09:01,126
No, we won't!

163
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:03,187
Ferengi can be just
as tough as Klingons.

164
00:09:03,232 --> 00:09:04,792
- They can?
- Of course they can.

165
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,938
They just need the opportunity,
the training

166
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,350
and a couple of bars
of latinum as incentive.

167
00:09:11,387 --> 00:09:13,551
Coming out of my share,
I suppose.

168
00:09:13,592 --> 00:09:15,152
No!

169
00:09:15,196 --> 00:09:18,227
We'll split the reward
with whoever joins us...

170
00:09:18,305 --> 00:09:21,438
all... 20 bars of it.

171
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:23,713
But the Nagus offered 50.

172
00:09:23,752 --> 00:09:27,751
As far as anyone else is
concerned, he said 20.

173
00:09:27,796 --> 00:09:30,428
20 it is, then.

174
00:09:33,611 --> 00:09:39,115
Now the only question is:
Who's our first recruit?

175
00:09:39,158 --> 00:09:40,491
Not me.

176
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:41,588
But Nog...

177
00:09:41,632 --> 00:09:42,658
Moogie needs you.

178
00:09:42,701 --> 00:09:44,170
Not to mention your Nagus.

179
00:09:44,205 --> 00:09:45,903
They need you, we need you...

180
00:09:45,943 --> 00:09:47,173
say you'll join us!

181
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:48,239
Please.

182
00:09:48,282 --> 00:09:50,914
I'm a Starfleet Officer.

183
00:09:50,956 --> 00:09:52,551
I can't go running off with you

184
00:09:52,594 --> 00:09:54,326
on some half-baked
rescue mission.

185
00:09:54,364 --> 00:09:55,833
I have duties to perform.

186
00:09:55,869 --> 00:09:57,635
But you know
how to fire a phaser.

187
00:09:57,674 --> 00:09:58,768
Forget it, Rom.

188
00:09:58,810 --> 00:09:59,972
Don't beg.

189
00:10:00,012 --> 00:10:01,504
Too bad, though.

190
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,854
We were going to make you
Strategic Operations officer.

191
00:10:04,892 --> 00:10:07,626
You mean, like Commander Worf?

192
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,934
Exactly like Commander Worf.

193
00:10:09,971 --> 00:10:11,099
Think of it, Nog.

194
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:12,771
You'll devise the tactics

195
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:14,716
come up with a plan of action.

196
00:10:14,751 --> 00:10:16,220
You could be the team's
drill instructor.

197
00:10:16,254 --> 00:10:18,020
Put us through our paces,
prepare us for combat.

198
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:19,187
Turn us into soldiers.

199
00:10:19,229 --> 00:10:21,724
That's a big job.

200
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:24,241
That's why we need you.

201
00:10:25,445 --> 00:10:27,075
How big is the team?

202
00:10:27,117 --> 00:10:28,609
Right now?

203
00:10:46,634 --> 00:10:50,474
Now, remember, Leck is
not your typical Ferengi.

204
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,744
His priorities are
different than ours.

205
00:10:52,783 --> 00:10:54,184
I understand, Brother.

206
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,054
No, you don't, but you will.

207
00:10:57,094 --> 00:11:00,091
I hope this is a secure channel.

208
00:11:00,136 --> 00:11:03,269
I followed your instructions
to the letter.

209
00:11:03,311 --> 00:11:04,644
Mmm, very good.

210
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:07,017
Who do you want eliminated?

211
00:11:07,054 --> 00:11:08,455
It's not that kind of job.

212
00:11:08,524 --> 00:11:10,654
Then why call an Eliminator?

213
00:11:10,696 --> 00:11:11,790
What's an Eliminator?

214
00:11:11,832 --> 00:11:15,330
Shh. I'm putting together
a little rescue mission

215
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,007
and I'd like you
to be part of my team.

216
00:11:18,048 --> 00:11:20,350
I work alone.

217
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,687
You'll be paid in latinum.

218
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:24,665
I don't care about latinum.

219
00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:25,963
You're right.

220
00:11:26,003 --> 00:11:28,407
His priorities are different.

221
00:11:28,442 --> 00:11:29,775
All right.

222
00:11:29,812 --> 00:11:31,338
Forget the latinum.

223
00:11:31,383 --> 00:11:32,875
I've been told you
like the opportunity

224
00:11:32,921 --> 00:11:33,912
to test your abilities.

225
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:38,731
I enjoy a challenge.

226
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:40,364
Then you should know this...

227
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:42,537
that the person
we're going to rescue

228
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:44,344
is being held by the Dominion.

229
00:11:44,383 --> 00:11:45,943
The Dominion?

230
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:48,552
Should be quite a challenge.

231
00:11:48,628 --> 00:11:50,360
Hmm.

232
00:12:01,695 --> 00:12:05,296
How the mighty have fallen.

233
00:12:05,338 --> 00:12:08,506
Cousin Quark.

234
00:12:08,546 --> 00:12:11,782
I heard you were arrested
on Thalos VI for vagrancy.

235
00:12:11,821 --> 00:12:14,920
It's all your fault.

236
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:20,134
I was a thriving
weapons merchant...

237
00:12:20,176 --> 00:12:23,674
until I went into business
with you.

238
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:26,157
You ruined me.

239
00:12:29,868 --> 00:12:32,808
If I ever get out of here,
Cousin

240
00:12:32,843 --> 00:12:36,808
I'll make you pay
for what you did to me.

241
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:43,793
Lower the force field.

242
00:12:46,177 --> 00:12:48,775
Now, what exactly is it
you were going to do to me?

243
00:12:48,817 --> 00:12:51,187
I don't understand.

244
00:12:51,224 --> 00:12:53,252
Quark paid your fine.

245
00:12:53,295 --> 00:12:55,289
You're a free man.

246
00:12:57,707 --> 00:13:00,271
What do I have to do in return?

247
00:13:00,314 --> 00:13:02,285
Earn some latinum.

248
00:13:04,893 --> 00:13:06,921
Tell me more.

249
00:13:19,877 --> 00:13:22,715
On the bar you will find a padd

250
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,556
with the schematic of
a Dominion internment center.

251
00:13:26,593 --> 00:13:29,624
You may now examine
the schematic.

252
00:13:42,836 --> 00:13:46,608
How can we be sure
these schematics are accurate?

253
00:13:46,646 --> 00:13:48,412
Sir.

254
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,048
Oh, no need to stand
on formality here.

255
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:52,583
Just call me Leck.

256
00:13:52,628 --> 00:13:55,362
No, I meant
you should call me "sir."

257
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:56,462
Don't be ridiculous.

258
00:13:56,504 --> 00:13:57,473
You mean

259
00:13:57,507 --> 00:13:58,908
"Don't be ridiculous, sir."

260
00:13:58,944 --> 00:14:00,106
Gentlemen, please.

261
00:14:00,181 --> 00:14:01,445
Let's not squabble.

262
00:14:01,484 --> 00:14:03,752
We're a team, Nog.

263
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,952
We're a team, sir.

264
00:14:04,994 --> 00:14:06,429
Stay out of this.
Listen to me, Nog...

265
00:14:06,464 --> 00:14:08,264
That's it. I quit.

266
00:14:08,302 --> 00:14:10,034
You can't quit.

267
00:14:10,073 --> 00:14:12,341
This is not a game.

268
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,408
How are we supposed to get

269
00:14:14,451 --> 00:14:17,323
to this "internment center,"
anyway?

270
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:18,350
By ship.

271
00:14:18,395 --> 00:14:20,799
Do we have a ship?

272
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:22,303
We'll get one.

273
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:24,105
We don't have a ship?

274
00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:25,112
I said, we'll get one!

275
00:14:25,146 --> 00:14:25,806
How?

276
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:26,816
We'll find one.

277
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:27,545
Where?

278
00:14:27,585 --> 00:14:29,453
I don't know!

279
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,925
Think of it as a challenge.

280
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:37,871
Liquidator Brunt!

281
00:14:37,912 --> 00:14:39,849
That's ex-Liquidator Brunt.

282
00:14:39,884 --> 00:14:41,285
Thanks to your brother

283
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:44,193
I'm no longer with
the Ferengi Commerce Authority.

284
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,544
A child...

285
00:14:51,581 --> 00:14:53,279
a moron...

286
00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:54,652
a failure...

287
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:56,991
and a psychopath.

288
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:00,094
Quite a little team
you put together.

289
00:15:00,137 --> 00:15:01,367
What do you want, Brunt?

290
00:15:01,407 --> 00:15:02,774
I'm here to sign up.

291
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,146
I'm going to help you
rescue your mother.

292
00:15:05,216 --> 00:15:06,880
What?

293
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:09,416
How do you know about Moogie?

294
00:15:09,461 --> 00:15:11,557
I know a lot of things.

295
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:14,037
Ah... you think if you
help save my mother

296
00:15:14,073 --> 00:15:16,545
the Nagus will give you
your old job back.

297
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:18,014
When do we leave?

298
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,680
We're not leaving.

299
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,486
Not with you.

300
00:15:21,525 --> 00:15:24,191
That's one thing
we can all agree on.

301
00:15:24,232 --> 00:15:26,602
Nobody likes Liquidators.

302
00:15:26,638 --> 00:15:28,974
Or even ex-Liquidators.

303
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,709
The team has spoken.

304
00:15:30,749 --> 00:15:34,657
Besides, there's a 20-bar
reward to consider.

305
00:15:34,693 --> 00:15:37,861
Better to split it
five ways than six.

306
00:15:37,901 --> 00:15:39,804
Fine.

307
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,340
I'll just get in my ship
and leave.

308
00:15:47,793 --> 00:15:49,855
Did you say ship?

309
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:52,201
That's right.

310
00:15:54,043 --> 00:15:56,105
Why?

311
00:16:01,496 --> 00:16:04,436
Now we are six.

312
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:22,911
Don't move!

313
00:16:22,951 --> 00:16:24,511
You're surrounded.

314
00:16:32,276 --> 00:16:33,871
Don't shoot!

315
00:16:33,913 --> 00:16:35,075
I surrender!

316
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,063
No, no, no!

317
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:45,701
Computer, freeze program.

318
00:16:45,744 --> 00:16:48,980
Reset Jem'Hadar.

319
00:16:50,623 --> 00:16:52,287
I think we're getting better.

320
00:16:52,328 --> 00:16:53,319
No, you're not.

321
00:16:53,364 --> 00:16:55,028
This is the eighth run-through

322
00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:57,941
and you haven't been able
to hit a single Jem'Hadar.

323
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,103
And you shot Moogie!

324
00:16:59,145 --> 00:17:01,207
I saw we weren't
going to rescue her

325
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,050
so I put her out of her misery.

326
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:04,719
Who invited him along?

327
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,293
Maybe we should start off
with something easier.

328
00:17:08,336 --> 00:17:09,862
Like what?

329
00:17:09,906 --> 00:17:12,140
Like a ambushing
a couple of Bolians.

330
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:13,478
You couldn't ambush a Bolian

331
00:17:13,516 --> 00:17:15,350
if he was blindfolded
and tied to a tree!

332
00:17:15,421 --> 00:17:18,293
That's enough!

333
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,924
Get out of here, all of you.

334
00:17:19,966 --> 00:17:21,596
You heard me.

335
00:17:21,637 --> 00:17:23,836
Go.

336
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:31,721
But, Brother, don't you want
to keep practicing?

337
00:17:31,763 --> 00:17:33,631
We're wasting our time, Rom.

338
00:17:33,668 --> 00:17:36,106
We couldn't get
anywhere near Moogie

339
00:17:36,141 --> 00:17:37,701
let alone rescue her.

340
00:17:37,746 --> 00:17:41,187
I guess we're not cut out
to be heroes after all.

341
00:17:41,221 --> 00:17:44,924
And to think,
just a few short days ago

342
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:48,531
I was sitting
on top of the world.

343
00:17:48,574 --> 00:17:50,340
The King of Squill.

344
00:17:50,378 --> 00:17:52,577
You should have been there,
Brother.

345
00:17:52,617 --> 00:17:54,679
It was a very delicate
negotiation.

346
00:17:54,723 --> 00:17:58,996
It could've gone either way,
but I took my time

347
00:17:59,034 --> 00:18:01,768
picked my moment, and then...

348
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:03,209
went in for the kill.

349
00:18:03,245 --> 00:18:06,276
It was beautiful to behold.

350
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:09,019
Brother...

351
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,034
I think we've been going
about this the wrong way.

352
00:18:12,068 --> 00:18:13,560
We're not commandos.

353
00:18:13,605 --> 00:18:14,972
We're negotiators.

354
00:18:15,009 --> 00:18:16,137
We make deals.

355
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,342
That's what we're good at.

356
00:18:18,385 --> 00:18:21,187
The Dominion has something
we want

357
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,597
so we need to find something
they want...

358
00:18:24,634 --> 00:18:26,571
And then we make a trade!

359
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,170
That way,
everyone goes home happy.

360
00:18:29,212 --> 00:18:31,080
Happy and alive.

361
00:18:31,117 --> 00:18:34,615
Now, what do we have to trade?

362
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,841
Captain, I can't thank you
enough for all your help.

363
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:41,844
Don't thank me.

364
00:18:41,877 --> 00:18:42,971
Thank Major Kira.

365
00:18:43,014 --> 00:18:45,316
She's the one that convinced me

366
00:18:45,353 --> 00:18:47,051
to talk to Starfleet
on your behalf.

367
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,389
Consider it payback, Quark

368
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:50,023
for rescuing me
from the Dominion.

369
00:18:50,065 --> 00:18:51,159
Breaking you out

370
00:18:51,201 --> 00:18:53,799
of the station's holding cell
is one thing.

371
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,971
What you're planning to do
is considerably more dangerous.

372
00:18:56,014 --> 00:18:59,478
Every negotiation has
its share of danger, Captain.

373
00:18:59,523 --> 00:19:01,289
If you say so.

374
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:05,630
I guess it's time for me
to pick up my prisoner.

375
00:19:05,672 --> 00:19:08,908
Just be careful you don't
turn your back on him, Quark.

376
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,348
He's not to be trusted.

377
00:19:10,385 --> 00:19:12,288
Neither am I.

378
00:19:25,256 --> 00:19:26,225
Excuse me.

379
00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:28,253
Ah!

380
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:29,266
Sorry.

381
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,269
This isn't a ship.

382
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,270
It's a closet.

383
00:19:31,339 --> 00:19:33,139
If you don't like it here,
leave.

384
00:19:33,177 --> 00:19:34,476
I'll go.

385
00:19:34,514 --> 00:19:37,647
That way there'll be more room
for the rest of you.

386
00:19:37,688 --> 00:19:40,126
Besides, this isn't
a rescue mission anymore.

387
00:19:40,162 --> 00:19:41,757
It's a simple prisoner exchange.

388
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,737
I don't know
why Quark needs any of us.

389
00:19:43,771 --> 00:19:46,300
Because he doesn't trust
the Dominion.

390
00:19:46,344 --> 00:19:47,643
And neither do I.

391
00:19:47,681 --> 00:19:49,311
Why would the Dominion

392
00:19:49,386 --> 00:19:52,188
pick a deserted Cardassian
space station

393
00:19:52,227 --> 00:19:53,526
to make the trade?

394
00:19:53,564 --> 00:19:55,660
They didn't pick it, Quark did.

395
00:19:55,702 --> 00:19:57,001
I've been there.

396
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,101
It's the same design
as Deep Space 9

397
00:19:59,145 --> 00:20:00,341
so we know the layout.

398
00:20:00,415 --> 00:20:03,183
Well, you have nothing
to worry about.

399
00:20:03,222 --> 00:20:06,560
You'll have plenty of places
to run and hide.

400
00:20:09,671 --> 00:20:12,543
Everyone, this is Keevan.

401
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,071
We're going to trade him
for Ishka.

402
00:20:14,116 --> 00:20:16,588
Hi.

403
00:20:16,623 --> 00:20:17,956
I'm Rom.

404
00:20:17,994 --> 00:20:19,692
This is Nog.

405
00:20:19,731 --> 00:20:20,927
That's Brunt...

406
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:22,095
Rom...

407
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,732
he doesn't care.

408
00:20:23,775 --> 00:20:27,239
Truer words have
never been spoken.

409
00:20:27,285 --> 00:20:28,584
I'll advise you all

410
00:20:28,621 --> 00:20:31,219
to send final messages
to your loved ones

411
00:20:31,261 --> 00:20:33,733
and make sure
your wills are in order.

412
00:20:33,768 --> 00:20:34,964
Why?

413
00:20:35,004 --> 00:20:37,100
Because the moment
we leave this station

414
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:39,273
you'll have signed
your death warrants.

415
00:20:39,316 --> 00:20:41,618
Now if you don't mind

416
00:20:41,654 --> 00:20:43,956
I'm going to take a nap.

417
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,699
All clear!

418
00:21:38,736 --> 00:21:40,366
Are you sure?

419
00:21:40,407 --> 00:21:43,848
Tricorder indicates no other
life-forms on the station.

420
00:21:57,017 --> 00:21:58,350
All right.

421
00:21:58,387 --> 00:21:59,856
Let's head for base camp.

422
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:01,521
"Base camp"?

423
00:22:01,562 --> 00:22:02,963
He means the Infirmary.

424
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:04,366
It's right over there.

425
00:22:04,403 --> 00:22:06,932
Come on. Let's move it.
On the double!

426
00:22:06,976 --> 00:22:09,380
Well, what are you waiting for?

427
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,182
Two slips of latinum

428
00:22:11,221 --> 00:22:13,955
for the first man
who makes it to the Infirmary.

429
00:22:18,974 --> 00:22:20,569
I mean "base camp."

430
00:22:20,645 --> 00:22:23,585
You don't pay your soldiers
to do their duty.

431
00:22:23,652 --> 00:22:25,316
You do if they're Ferengi.

432
00:22:30,003 --> 00:22:31,803
Great! Another closet.

433
00:22:34,681 --> 00:22:36,915
We've chosen this spot
for a reason.

434
00:22:36,954 --> 00:22:39,792
For one thing,
it's a confined area

435
00:22:39,828 --> 00:22:41,890
with only two ways in or out...

436
00:22:41,934 --> 00:22:43,460
this one,
and that one over there.

437
00:22:43,504 --> 00:22:45,634
Secondly, it's near the airlock

438
00:22:45,677 --> 00:22:47,443
which gives us
access to our ship

439
00:22:47,481 --> 00:22:48,950
and third, it's on the Promenade

440
00:22:48,985 --> 00:22:51,081
where the prisoner exchange
will take place.

441
00:22:51,124 --> 00:22:52,650
Don't touch that.

442
00:22:52,762 --> 00:22:55,234
Some of this medical equipment
is still functioning.

443
00:22:55,268 --> 00:22:57,239
Anything for an upset stomach?

444
00:22:57,273 --> 00:22:58,799
What you need is a new backbone.

445
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,143
Hey!

446
00:23:00,181 --> 00:23:02,813
I'm a weapons dealer,
not a soldier.

447
00:23:02,854 --> 00:23:04,050
Cousin!

448
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,325
Sir, may I suggest we set up
our defense perimeter?

449
00:23:06,364 --> 00:23:07,628
Good idea.

450
00:23:07,701 --> 00:23:09,501
How much is this
going to cost me?

451
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:11,008
Don't worry.
No charge.

452
00:23:11,042 --> 00:23:13,640
Starfleet has really
corrupted you, hasn't it?

453
00:23:13,716 --> 00:23:15,482
You could start by getting

454
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,457
the external sensors
back on line.

455
00:23:17,492 --> 00:23:19,656
I want to know the minute
a Dominion ship

456
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,261
gets within ten million
kilometers of this station.

457
00:23:22,305 --> 00:23:24,299
I'll set up
a transport jamming signal.

458
00:23:24,343 --> 00:23:26,211
That way,
the Dominion won't be able

459
00:23:26,248 --> 00:23:28,618
to beam our prisoner away
without our say-so.

460
00:23:28,654 --> 00:23:31,685
We certainly wouldn't
want that to happen, would we?

461
00:23:31,796 --> 00:23:33,699
You don't seem
to be too happy

462
00:23:33,734 --> 00:23:36,400
at the prospect
of rejoining your people.

463
00:23:36,442 --> 00:23:38,072
Believe me when I tell you

464
00:23:38,112 --> 00:23:40,083
I have nothing
to be happy about.

465
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,613
Vorta are supposed
to commit suicide

466
00:23:42,658 --> 00:23:44,994
when they're captured.

467
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:47,798
I failed to follow
that rather... harsh policy.

468
00:23:49,341 --> 00:23:51,312
So they're going to execute you?

469
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:57,454
After what is surely going to be
a most unpleasant debriefing.

470
00:23:57,496 --> 00:24:00,094
I'm sorry to hear about that,
but it's not my problem.

471
00:24:00,137 --> 00:24:01,767
All I want is my Moogie back.

472
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:04,403
By the time the Dominion
is done with you

473
00:24:04,447 --> 00:24:06,077
all you'll want...

474
00:24:06,118 --> 00:24:08,112
is a quick... death.

475
00:24:08,157 --> 00:24:10,995
Take him in the next room
and see that he stays there.

476
00:24:11,031 --> 00:24:13,093
We'll post a guard
on him at all times.

477
00:24:13,136 --> 00:24:14,605
Four hour shifts.

478
00:24:14,641 --> 00:24:16,110
You heard him. Move.

479
00:24:16,144 --> 00:24:18,240
Perhaps you can help me
clarify something.

480
00:24:18,284 --> 00:24:21,486
What's the most vulnerable part
of a Jem'Hadar's body, hmm?

481
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:23,326
All right.
You have your orders.

482
00:24:23,364 --> 00:24:24,697
Let's get to work.

483
00:24:26,337 --> 00:24:28,035
My son the soldier.

484
00:24:29,512 --> 00:24:31,269
They've ruined him.

485
00:24:41,328 --> 00:24:42,797
What was that?

486
00:24:42,832 --> 00:24:44,301
Who's screaming?

487
00:24:44,336 --> 00:24:45,805
It's Gaila!

488
00:24:47,678 --> 00:24:49,238
The Vorta... where is he?

489
00:24:49,282 --> 00:24:50,751
I don't know.

490
00:24:50,786 --> 00:24:51,777
What do you mean you don't know?

491
00:24:51,822 --> 00:24:52,882
You were guarding him!

492
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:55,557
He must have slipped away
while I was sleeping.

493
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:57,570
Sleeping?!
Who said you could sleep?

494
00:24:57,604 --> 00:24:58,469
I couldn't help it.

495
00:24:58,506 --> 00:24:59,668
I was tired.

496
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,145
I couldn't get any rest
on the ship.

497
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,444
The ship...

498
00:25:02,483 --> 00:25:05,616
if Keevan gets away,
we're finished!

499
00:25:05,658 --> 00:25:07,150
Ah!

500
00:25:39,245 --> 00:25:42,047
Going someplace?

501
00:25:42,086 --> 00:25:43,716
Apparently not.

502
00:25:43,757 --> 00:25:46,559
I couldn't get
the impulse engines on line.

503
00:25:46,598 --> 00:25:50,803
That's because I had Rom
disengage the induction matrix.

504
00:25:50,842 --> 00:25:53,371
Then why did you
bother chasing me?

505
00:25:53,415 --> 00:25:57,586
Because sometimes
my brother gets things wrong.

506
00:26:04,577 --> 00:26:06,172
All right, everyone relax.

507
00:26:06,249 --> 00:26:07,718
No harm done.

508
00:26:07,752 --> 00:26:09,221
We still have our prisoner.

509
00:26:10,727 --> 00:26:11,696
What's that?!

510
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:12,858
It's the alarm I set up.

511
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,928
It means a Dominion ship
is approaching.

512
00:26:14,971 --> 00:26:17,205
To the Infirmary!

513
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:18,269
Let's go!

514
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,980
Now what?

515
00:27:00,022 --> 00:27:02,256
Someone turned the alarm off.

516
00:27:02,295 --> 00:27:04,494
Maybe it went off by itself.

517
00:27:06,505 --> 00:27:08,271
Do you hear something?

518
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,281
Someone's out there.

519
00:27:10,348 --> 00:27:13,881
One of us
should go check to make sure.

520
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:15,450
I nominate Quark.

521
00:27:15,495 --> 00:27:16,486
Me?

522
00:27:16,531 --> 00:27:18,593
I'll go.

523
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:42,629
Firing line take aim.

524
00:27:51,455 --> 00:27:53,119
Anybody there?

525
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,428
You could say that.

526
00:28:08,455 --> 00:28:10,392
I wonder what they're
doing out there.

527
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,759
Shh.

528
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:13,028
I don't hear anything.

529
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:14,230
Quiet.

530
00:28:14,271 --> 00:28:15,399
Why are we hiding?

531
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,909
There are Jem'Hadar out there.

532
00:28:16,944 --> 00:28:19,074
Of course they're out there.

533
00:28:19,116 --> 00:28:20,312
We asked them to come.

534
00:28:20,353 --> 00:28:21,822
He's right.

535
00:28:21,857 --> 00:28:24,659
Everything's going
according to plan.

536
00:28:24,697 --> 00:28:26,896
Now, all you have to do, Quark

537
00:28:26,937 --> 00:28:29,535
is negotiate
the prisoner exchange.

538
00:28:29,577 --> 00:28:31,445
Remember, be firm, strong.

539
00:28:31,482 --> 00:28:33,316
But don't get them angry.

540
00:28:33,353 --> 00:28:34,822
Good luck, Brother.

541
00:28:34,857 --> 00:28:36,452
Say "Hi" to Moogie for me.

542
00:28:36,495 --> 00:28:37,964
What if it's a trap?

543
00:28:37,998 --> 00:28:39,832
Of course it's a trap.

544
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:42,308
They're not here to negotiate.

545
00:28:42,343 --> 00:28:44,975
They're here to kill us all.

546
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:45,986
You think?

547
00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:47,215
Don't listen to him.

548
00:28:47,256 --> 00:28:49,490
He's just trying
to save his own neck.

549
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:51,589
I'm trying to save
all our necks.

550
00:28:51,634 --> 00:28:53,662
Ferengi, show yourself.

551
00:28:53,706 --> 00:28:56,110
We're here to trade.

552
00:28:56,145 --> 00:28:57,637
Don't go out there.

553
00:28:57,683 --> 00:28:59,951
We must get back to the ship.

554
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:02,257
Our only hope is to escape.

555
00:29:02,295 --> 00:29:05,029
We're not going anywhere...
not without Moogie.

556
00:29:05,069 --> 00:29:06,402
Right, Uncle?

557
00:29:09,012 --> 00:29:10,174
Right.

558
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:13,783
Ferengi, I don't like
to be kept waiting.

559
00:29:13,825 --> 00:29:15,455
I'm coming.

560
00:29:15,496 --> 00:29:17,160
I'm coming!

561
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:21,340
And you two are coming with me.

562
00:29:23,216 --> 00:29:24,651
I was afraid he was
going to say that.

563
00:29:24,686 --> 00:29:26,589
Rom...

564
00:30:11,173 --> 00:30:13,076
Moogie!

565
00:30:13,112 --> 00:30:14,810
My boys.

566
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,376
I knew you'd come.

567
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:18,893
You look beautiful.

568
00:30:18,928 --> 00:30:22,563
My lobes haven't been this firm
in over a century.

569
00:30:22,604 --> 00:30:25,601
I guess that
makes all this worthwhile.

570
00:30:25,644 --> 00:30:28,412
Don't you start with me, Quark.

571
00:30:36,506 --> 00:30:38,534
What a touching
and heartfelt reunion.

572
00:30:38,578 --> 00:30:41,450
I'm glad I was
here to witness it.

573
00:30:41,486 --> 00:30:43,354
Now, where's Keevan?

574
00:30:43,391 --> 00:30:46,695
I wish to conclude
this transaction.

575
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:48,897
All in good time

576
00:30:48,939 --> 00:30:52,574
but first,
I need some assurances.

577
00:30:52,614 --> 00:30:55,143
What kind of assurances?

578
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:57,182
Well, for one thing

579
00:30:57,227 --> 00:31:00,725
I don't want any Jem'Hadar
soldiers on this station.

580
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:04,210
That would leave me
in a very vulnerable position.

581
00:31:04,245 --> 00:31:06,513
One Vorta against six Ferengi.

582
00:31:06,551 --> 00:31:09,719
If it makes you feel better,
these two can stay.

583
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,524
I feel safer already.

584
00:31:11,564 --> 00:31:13,194
Now, where's Keevan?

585
00:31:13,234 --> 00:31:15,296
Hold on, I'm not done yet.

586
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,371
Then, you're going to tell
your helmsman

587
00:31:18,415 --> 00:31:22,482
to head back to Dominion
territory... warp nine.

588
00:31:22,525 --> 00:31:25,727
That would leave me
stranded here.

589
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:27,066
For a few days.

590
00:31:27,105 --> 00:31:28,301
I see

591
00:31:28,341 --> 00:31:31,747
and by the time they return,
you'll be long gone.

592
00:31:31,783 --> 00:31:33,275
That's the idea.

593
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,784
On the other hand,
I could have my Jem'Hadar

594
00:31:36,863 --> 00:31:38,993
storm the Infirmary
and kill you all.

595
00:31:39,035 --> 00:31:40,630
I like our plan better.

596
00:31:40,672 --> 00:31:42,141
You attack the Infirmary

597
00:31:42,177 --> 00:31:44,171
and Keevan will be
the first to die.

598
00:31:44,215 --> 00:31:46,813
Keevan's fate
has already been sealed.

599
00:31:46,889 --> 00:31:51,800
Maybe, but before he dies,
I'll bet you'll want to know

600
00:31:51,835 --> 00:31:55,470
what Dominion secrets
he's revealed to the Federation.

601
00:31:55,511 --> 00:31:58,313
He's got you there, Yelgrun.

602
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:07,130
Your people have
a reputation for cunning.

603
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,545
I see that it's well-earned.

604
00:32:09,581 --> 00:32:14,322
Perhaps one day, the Ferengi
will take their place

605
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,459
as valued members
of the Dominion.

606
00:32:17,501 --> 00:32:20,030
Anything's possible.

607
00:32:20,075 --> 00:32:24,212
I will begin to evacuate
the Jem'Hadar at once.

608
00:32:24,253 --> 00:32:27,591
We can exchange the prisoners
in, let's say, half an hour?

609
00:32:27,628 --> 00:32:29,063
We'll be waiting.

610
00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:32,435
One more thing.

611
00:32:32,474 --> 00:32:34,104
How do we know

612
00:32:34,145 --> 00:32:36,344
that's really Moogie
and not a changeling?

613
00:32:36,384 --> 00:32:39,483
I think that uniform
is too tight on you, Nog.

614
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:42,431
It's cutting off circulation
to your brain.

615
00:32:42,466 --> 00:32:44,164
Sounds like Moogie.

616
00:32:45,775 --> 00:32:48,715
Only one way to find out.

617
00:32:48,749 --> 00:32:50,686
Wait.

618
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:52,783
This should be interesting.

619
00:32:57,405 --> 00:32:58,874
Ow!

620
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:01,039
Yeah. That's blood all right.

621
00:33:01,082 --> 00:33:02,712
I knew it was Moogie.

622
00:33:02,752 --> 00:33:06,889
Now let's see
if you're a changeling.

623
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,867
That's no way
to tell if he's a changeling.

624
00:33:08,901 --> 00:33:10,370
You're right.

625
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:12,206
Give me that knife.

626
00:33:12,243 --> 00:33:14,237
I don't think so.

627
00:33:14,282 --> 00:33:15,751
Family...

628
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:17,278
you understand.

629
00:33:17,324 --> 00:33:18,486
Not really.

630
00:33:18,527 --> 00:33:19,723
I was cloned.

631
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:22,259
No parents?

632
00:33:22,303 --> 00:33:23,898
That explains a lot.

633
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,435
No parents, no sweetheart.

634
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,782
No investment portfolio.

635
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,119
And no patience.

636
00:33:30,157 --> 00:33:33,290
We'll meet back here
in one half hour.

637
00:33:33,331 --> 00:33:35,495
Don't be late.

638
00:33:35,538 --> 00:33:37,304
You heard him, Quark.

639
00:33:37,342 --> 00:33:39,576
Rom, I'm counting on you.

640
00:33:39,614 --> 00:33:42,850
Remember... Moogie loves you.

641
00:33:46,613 --> 00:33:50,054
You should have
seen my brother.

642
00:33:50,089 --> 00:33:51,524
He was brilliant.

643
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:53,051
In a half hour

644
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:56,538
we'll have Moogie back
and we can all go home.

645
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:03,490
Home... to the torrential rains
of Ferenginar.

646
00:34:03,524 --> 00:34:04,925
You know what I miss most?

647
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:07,399
The rotting vegetation.

648
00:34:07,435 --> 00:34:08,404
Yep.

649
00:34:08,437 --> 00:34:10,408
And the dampness.

650
00:34:10,442 --> 00:34:14,852
Oh, to stand once more
in those rivers of muck.

651
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:18,852
Oh, I only wish I
could be there with you.

652
00:34:20,401 --> 00:34:21,870
I can't believe it.

653
00:34:21,905 --> 00:34:24,434
We're actually going
to get the reward money.

654
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,643
50 bars of gold-pressed latinum.

655
00:34:26,684 --> 00:34:29,179
50 bars?
You said the reward was 20.

656
00:34:29,224 --> 00:34:30,659
That's what Rom said.
20.

657
00:34:30,695 --> 00:34:32,130
He said 50.

658
00:34:32,165 --> 00:34:34,797
I thought you said you
didn't care about latinum.

659
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:37,140
I don't! I just don't
like to be cheated.

660
00:34:37,178 --> 00:34:38,808
Everyone calm down.

661
00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:41,823
Calm down? When my dear cousin
is trying to cheat me?

662
00:34:41,891 --> 00:34:43,258
I'm not trying to cheat anyone.

663
00:34:43,294 --> 00:34:44,729
Then what about
the other 30 bars?!

664
00:34:44,764 --> 00:34:47,566
There are no other 30 bars...
are there?

665
00:34:47,605 --> 00:34:49,303
Uh... no, not really.

666
00:34:49,343 --> 00:34:50,573
He's lying.

667
00:34:50,613 --> 00:34:52,048
They're in it together.

668
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:54,453
You're not going to get
away with this, Quark!

669
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:56,724
I come here, risk my life,
and for what?!

670
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:59,394
You've had this coming
for a long time, Cousin!

671
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,375
Look out!

672
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:09,753
I hate Ferengi.

673
00:35:28,411 --> 00:35:31,249
You idiot.

674
00:35:45,588 --> 00:35:47,057
What are we going to do?

675
00:35:47,093 --> 00:35:48,927
We can't have
a prisoner exchange

676
00:35:48,964 --> 00:35:50,433
without a prisoner.

677
00:35:50,468 --> 00:35:51,698
If they find out Keevan's dead

678
00:35:51,738 --> 00:35:52,798
they're going to kill us.

679
00:35:52,841 --> 00:35:53,867
Will you stop saying that?

680
00:35:55,314 --> 00:36:00,350
Maybe, if we surrender,
they won't hurt us.

681
00:36:01,998 --> 00:36:03,399
I have a better idea.

682
00:36:03,435 --> 00:36:05,907
Let's sneak back to my ship
and try to escape.

683
00:36:05,975 --> 00:36:07,741
It's a big station...

684
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,010
easy to get lost in.

685
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:11,021
If we hide,
maybe they won't find us.

686
00:36:11,055 --> 00:36:12,581
No one's hiding
and no one's escaping

687
00:36:12,626 --> 00:36:14,825
and no one's surrendering.

688
00:36:15,868 --> 00:36:17,702
What's wrong with you people?

689
00:36:17,739 --> 00:36:20,177
Have you forgotten
the Battle of Prexnak?

690
00:36:20,212 --> 00:36:21,681
Who could forget

691
00:36:21,716 --> 00:36:24,554
the most important battle
in Ferengi history?!

692
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:29,091
Ten Ferengi stood alone
against 273 Lytasians.

693
00:36:29,135 --> 00:36:33,272
As I recall, all ten Ferengi
were slaughtered.

694
00:36:33,313 --> 00:36:34,977
The point is

695
00:36:35,017 --> 00:36:38,082
we Ferengi are just as tough
as anyone in the galaxy.

696
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:40,997
And this is our chance
to prove it...

697
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:42,558
once and for all.

698
00:36:46,279 --> 00:36:47,748
Quark's right.

699
00:36:47,784 --> 00:36:49,948
Let's do it for Ishka.

700
00:36:49,989 --> 00:36:52,621
Let's do it
for the Grand Nagus.

701
00:36:52,663 --> 00:36:55,431
Let's do it
for Ferengis everywhere!

702
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,464
Let's do it for equal shares

703
00:36:57,508 --> 00:37:00,310
of 50 bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

704
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:04,156
It always comes down to profit
with you people, doesn't it?

705
00:37:04,193 --> 00:37:06,130
We're Ferengi.

706
00:37:06,164 --> 00:37:09,195
And that's why I love you!

707
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:12,577
50 bars it is...

708
00:37:12,614 --> 00:37:15,018
minus my usual finder's fee.

709
00:37:15,087 --> 00:37:18,585
Well, there's no doubt about it.

710
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:22,231
According to these readings,
this man is dead.

711
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:24,541
Thank you, Dr. Nog.

712
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:26,675
I just wanted to be sure.

713
00:37:26,718 --> 00:37:28,278
I thought maybe

714
00:37:28,323 --> 00:37:31,764
we could revive him,
but I guess not.

715
00:37:33,436 --> 00:37:34,564
He's alive!

716
00:37:34,605 --> 00:37:35,733
No, he isn't.

717
00:37:35,774 --> 00:37:38,212
It's just the neural stimulator.

718
00:37:38,247 --> 00:37:41,187
It caused a reflexive impulse
in his cerebellum.

719
00:37:41,222 --> 00:37:43,990
I never knew you studied
medicine at the Academy.

720
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:46,092
I didn't,
but if you think about it

721
00:37:46,135 --> 00:37:48,903
medicine isn't that different
from engineering.

722
00:37:48,943 --> 00:37:51,245
It's all about
keeping things running

723
00:37:51,281 --> 00:37:52,750
fixing broken parts.

724
00:37:52,786 --> 00:37:56,353
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

725
00:37:56,395 --> 00:37:58,663
Find me more neural stimulators!

726
00:37:58,701 --> 00:38:00,331
It's time, Ferengi.

727
00:38:00,372 --> 00:38:02,002
Bring out your prisoner.

728
00:38:02,043 --> 00:38:03,673
Stall them, Uncle.

729
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,588
I'll try.

730
00:38:09,866 --> 00:38:11,860
I've done as you asked.

731
00:38:11,904 --> 00:38:14,901
The Jem'Hadar are on their way
back to Dominion territory.

732
00:38:14,945 --> 00:38:16,575
We are alone on the station.

733
00:38:16,617 --> 00:38:17,677
Wonderful.

734
00:38:17,786 --> 00:38:19,654
Now bring out Keevan

735
00:38:19,691 --> 00:38:22,688
and we can conclude
our business.

736
00:38:22,766 --> 00:38:24,930
Keevan. Right. Absolutely.

737
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:27,979
I'm waiting.

738
00:38:28,013 --> 00:38:29,643
He'll be right out.

739
00:38:29,684 --> 00:38:31,210
But first...

740
00:38:31,254 --> 00:38:34,126
my brother has to run
some sensor scans

741
00:38:34,162 --> 00:38:37,626
to make sure the Jem'Hadar
have really left.

742
00:38:37,671 --> 00:38:39,231
That is unnecessary.

743
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,075
The Jem'Hadar are gone.

744
00:38:41,113 --> 00:38:42,708
Now bring me Keevan.

745
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,744
I will, in a few minutes.

746
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:47,956
No, not in a few minutes.
Now!

747
00:38:47,998 --> 00:38:49,764
Or maybe you've changed
your mind

748
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,897
and you don't want
your mother back.

749
00:38:51,941 --> 00:38:53,240
Kill her.

750
00:38:53,278 --> 00:38:54,247
No!

751
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:56,879
Give them what they want, Quark.

752
00:38:56,921 --> 00:38:58,356
I intend to.

753
00:38:58,391 --> 00:38:59,587
Excellent.

754
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:03,502
As soon as my brother completes
his sensor scans.

755
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:07,840
And I thought the Breen
were annoying.

756
00:39:11,225 --> 00:39:12,751
Very well.

757
00:39:12,829 --> 00:39:15,097
Five minutes...

758
00:39:15,135 --> 00:39:19,545
but I will not tolerate
any more delays.

759
00:39:19,579 --> 00:39:21,413
Neither will I.

760
00:39:21,451 --> 00:39:24,789
That goes for me, too.

761
00:39:24,827 --> 00:39:27,824
You see, we're all in agreement.

762
00:39:30,174 --> 00:39:32,806
Um...

763
00:39:32,847 --> 00:39:36,516
one more thing.

764
00:39:36,557 --> 00:39:39,690
Why am I not surprised?

765
00:39:39,732 --> 00:39:41,532
The prisoner exchange...

766
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:44,772
I'd like for it to take place
outside Airlock 3.

767
00:39:44,812 --> 00:39:47,216
What's wrong with the Promenade?

768
00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:48,847
Nothing

769
00:39:48,922 --> 00:39:52,864
except my ship is docked
at Airlock 3.

770
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,199
You understand.

771
00:39:54,237 --> 00:39:57,143
Only too well

772
00:39:57,177 --> 00:40:00,151
but I must say your lack
of trust saddens me.

773
00:40:00,185 --> 00:40:02,179
Ah, well...

774
00:40:02,223 --> 00:40:04,695
a sign of the times.

775
00:40:09,376 --> 00:40:12,373
Nog, you have five minutes.

776
00:40:12,417 --> 00:40:13,909
All right.
Here we go.

777
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:32,165
7,500 lots of hypicate futures?

778
00:40:32,201 --> 00:40:34,571
The hypicate root
is very versatile.

779
00:40:34,608 --> 00:40:37,878
It's used in certain medicines,
diffractive optics

780
00:40:37,916 --> 00:40:40,080
and even some beauty supplies.

781
00:40:40,122 --> 00:40:42,252
Here, feel
how smooth my head is.

782
00:40:42,294 --> 00:40:44,766
Cream of hypicate.

783
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,771
I apply it twice a day.

784
00:40:46,806 --> 00:40:49,370
You see, a diversified
financial portfolio

785
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:52,819
can mean greater profits
and healthier-looking skin.

786
00:40:52,855 --> 00:40:54,154
Fascinating.

787
00:40:54,191 --> 00:40:55,660
I'd love to hear more

788
00:40:55,696 --> 00:40:58,032
but if your son
doesn't show up soon

789
00:40:58,102 --> 00:41:00,836
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to kill you.

790
00:41:01,845 --> 00:41:03,645
Yelgrun!

791
00:41:03,684 --> 00:41:05,746
You ready?

792
00:41:05,789 --> 00:41:07,315
I've been ready for hours.

793
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,831
On a count of three,
we release our prisoners.

794
00:41:09,865 --> 00:41:10,993
Agreed?

795
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,835
Agreed.

796
00:41:12,873 --> 00:41:14,673
One...

797
00:41:14,712 --> 00:41:16,774
two...

798
00:41:16,818 --> 00:41:18,789
three.

799
00:41:49,936 --> 00:41:53,104
What have they done to him?

800
00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:58,484
Straighten him out.
Straighten him out.

801
00:41:58,525 --> 00:41:59,892
I'm trying.

802
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,083
Stop them!

803
00:42:36,056 --> 00:42:37,822
Would you please turn him off?

804
00:42:37,861 --> 00:42:38,989
I can't.

805
00:42:39,031 --> 00:42:40,591
The transceiver is jammed.

806
00:42:40,634 --> 00:42:42,103
Oh, Quark

807
00:42:42,139 --> 00:42:45,272
the Grand Nagus is going
to be so proud of you.

808
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:46,783
I know I am.

809
00:42:48,589 --> 00:42:50,389
Moogie...

810
00:42:56,141 --> 00:42:58,135
What do we do with this one?

811
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,649
We'll take him with us.

812
00:42:59,684 --> 00:43:01,450
He'll be our gift to Starfleet.

813
00:43:01,489 --> 00:43:03,961
They gave us a Vorta,
we'll give them one.

814
00:43:03,996 --> 00:43:05,660
Ferengi...

815
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,169
I know, I know... you hate us.

816
00:43:07,271 --> 00:43:08,935
All right, you...

817
00:43:08,975 --> 00:43:10,308
get moving!

818
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:17,185
This is the sloppiest,
most amateurish operation

819
00:43:17,297 --> 00:43:19,200
I've ever seen.

820
00:43:19,235 --> 00:43:22,505
If you ever do something
like this again

821
00:43:22,543 --> 00:43:24,012
count me in.

822
00:43:24,048 --> 00:43:25,916
You'll be the first one I call.

823
00:43:28,292 --> 00:43:31,198
If I even think about doing
something like this again

824
00:43:31,232 --> 00:43:32,724
shoot me.

825
00:43:36,012 --> 00:43:37,642
So, Brother

826
00:43:37,683 --> 00:43:40,589
how does it feel to be a...
hero?

827
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,093
You tell me.

828
00:43:44,868 --> 00:43:48,172
It feels...

829
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:49,179
good?

830
00:43:54,527 --> 00:43:56,464
You bet it does.
