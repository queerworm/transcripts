1
00:00:10,417 --> 00:00:12,011
I didn't expect
to find you here.

2
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:14,025
I thought you'd be
down on the Promenade

3
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:15,893
helping Mardah put up
the decorations

4
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:18,527
for the Bajoran
Gratitude Festival.

5
00:00:18,569 --> 00:00:20,198
That was the plan

6
00:00:20,273 --> 00:00:24,375
but it turns out I don't have
much to be grateful for.

7
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:26,217
Isn't that the earring you?

8
00:00:26,255 --> 00:00:28,158
Bought for Mardah, yeah.
You want it?

9
00:00:28,192 --> 00:00:29,889
Maybe you can give it
to Major Kira

10
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,661
for her next birthday
or something.

11
00:00:32,904 --> 00:00:34,203
All right.

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,732
Tell me about it.

13
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:39,786
Mardah's gone, Dad.

14
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:42,258
She got accepted
to the Science Academy

15
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:43,762
on Regulus III.

16
00:00:43,796 --> 00:00:45,129
That's a good school.

17
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:48,264
It's 300 light-years away.

18
00:00:48,308 --> 00:00:49,572
Jake, you're 16.

19
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,139
Take my word for it,
you'll survive.

20
00:00:52,183 --> 00:00:54,883
Sooner or later,
you'll find someone else.

21
00:00:54,923 --> 00:00:56,222
Who knows?

22
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,854
Maybe you'll find someone
tonight

23
00:00:57,897 --> 00:00:59,230
at the Gratitude Festival.

24
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,395
Yeah, sure.

25
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:01,837
Jake, the whole point
of the festival

26
00:01:01,874 --> 00:01:04,141
is to put
all your troubles behind you

27
00:01:04,179 --> 00:01:05,808
and make a new start.

28
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:08,651
I could use one.

29
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:10,158
Okay, I'll go.

30
00:01:10,193 --> 00:01:11,218
Good.

31
00:01:11,263 --> 00:01:12,231
That's the spirit.

32
00:01:12,265 --> 00:01:15,261
But I'm not going
to have any fun.

33
00:01:15,305 --> 00:01:17,367
Oh.

34
00:01:20,718 --> 00:01:21,708
Nervous, Chief?

35
00:01:24,427 --> 00:01:25,555
What are you talking about?

36
00:01:25,597 --> 00:01:28,126
That's your fifth cup
of coffee in 20 minutes.

37
00:01:28,169 --> 00:01:29,832
I didn't realize you
were keeping track.

38
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:32,038
Oh, nervous and irascible.

39
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,309
If you hadn't seen your wife

40
00:01:33,382 --> 00:01:35,512
and child for two months,
you'd be irascible, too.

41
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:37,023
Oh, believe me,
I'm looking forward

42
00:01:37,058 --> 00:01:39,029
to Keiko and Molly's
visit as much as you are.

43
00:01:39,062 --> 00:01:40,224
I doubt that.

44
00:01:40,265 --> 00:01:41,290
How many games of racquetball

45
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:42,770
have we played
in the last two months?

46
00:01:43,907 --> 00:01:45,775
I don't know.
15, maybe 20.

47
00:01:45,812 --> 00:01:47,042
No, try 70.

48
00:01:47,082 --> 00:01:49,110
I've been keeping track
of that, too.

49
00:01:49,153 --> 00:01:51,921
You know what all those games
have proved to me?

50
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,124
That I'm a poor substitute
for your wife.

51
00:01:54,165 --> 00:01:56,602
I could have told you
that 60 games ago.

52
00:01:56,638 --> 00:01:59,475
Thing is, they're only going
to be here for two days.

53
00:01:59,511 --> 00:02:02,005
That's barely enough
time to say hello.

54
00:02:02,051 --> 00:02:05,787
And they're back to Bajor again
for another four months.

55
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:07,090
Four months?

56
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,533
Why, that's another
150 games of racquetball.

57
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:12,839
I don't think my elbow
can take that kind of abuse.

58
00:02:12,877 --> 00:02:15,314
Maybe you can try
and convince her to stay.

59
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:16,818
No, no, I can't do that.

60
00:02:16,852 --> 00:02:18,982
I mean, I'm the one
who suggested she go

61
00:02:19,024 --> 00:02:21,724
on this agrobiology expedition
in the first place.

62
00:02:21,764 --> 00:02:25,068
No, we'll just have to make the
best of the little time we have.

63
00:02:25,106 --> 00:02:28,740
Which means we can't waste
a second of the next two days.

64
00:02:40,476 --> 00:02:42,538
Ah, <i>peldor joi,</i> Odo.

65
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:45,953
<i>Peldor joi</i> to you, too, Major.

66
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:47,515
Well...

67
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:49,621
it's, uh...

68
00:02:49,665 --> 00:02:51,225
it's hard to believe

69
00:02:51,268 --> 00:02:54,207
the Promenade is
this empty at midday.

70
00:02:54,243 --> 00:02:56,680
Oh, calm before the storm.

71
00:02:56,715 --> 00:02:59,381
In a few hours, this
place will be packed

72
00:02:59,422 --> 00:03:01,951
with Bajorans
celebrating the festival.

73
00:03:01,994 --> 00:03:06,961
Actually, I was thinking
of joining you this year.

74
00:03:07,006 --> 00:03:08,407
Really?

75
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,979
I don't see why not.

76
00:03:10,014 --> 00:03:12,008
None of my Bajoran deputies

77
00:03:12,051 --> 00:03:13,418
work during
the Gratitude Festival.

78
00:03:13,455 --> 00:03:14,822
Why should I?

79
00:03:14,858 --> 00:03:19,324
Besides, if I'm going
to live here with you humanoids

80
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:22,866
I may as well immerse myself
in your rituals.

81
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,679
Well, then, we'll see
each other later.

82
00:03:25,718 --> 00:03:27,449
I'd like that.

83
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:29,254
If you're not too busy

84
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,628
being the Presider
at the festival.

85
00:03:31,665 --> 00:03:33,898
For you, I will
make the time, Odo.

86
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:38,107
Just look for me.
I'll be with Bareil.

87
00:03:38,148 --> 00:03:40,016
Oh...

88
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:44,256
I thought he'd be celebrating
the festival on Bajor.

89
00:03:44,296 --> 00:03:45,925
So did I.
I'm glad I was wrong.

90
00:03:45,966 --> 00:03:47,834
He's arriving
on the next shuttle.

91
00:03:47,871 --> 00:03:50,673
Well... you'd better go.

92
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:52,203
It'll be here soon.

93
00:03:52,248 --> 00:03:53,877
You're right.

94
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,753
I'll see you at the festival.

95
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,780
Ah.

96
00:04:10,558 --> 00:04:12,027
Chief.

97
00:04:12,062 --> 00:04:13,896
Major.

98
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:15,870
Keiko.

99
00:04:15,905 --> 00:04:17,705
Ah... Bareil.

100
00:04:17,742 --> 00:04:19,211
Good luck.

101
00:04:19,246 --> 00:04:20,738
You, too.

102
00:04:26,497 --> 00:04:28,491
Nerys...

103
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,265
I am so glad to see you.

104
00:04:30,306 --> 00:04:31,775
I missed you.

105
00:04:31,809 --> 00:04:33,643
I missed you, too.

106
00:04:40,163 --> 00:04:41,564
Miles.

107
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:43,102
Miles!

108
00:04:43,137 --> 00:04:44,572
Oh, Keiko.

109
00:04:45,843 --> 00:04:47,711
I'm so glad to see you.

110
00:04:47,747 --> 00:04:49,581
I have had the worst trip.

111
00:04:49,652 --> 00:04:51,520
Oh, really?
I'm sorry to hear that.

112
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,083
Now that you're here

113
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:55,030
everything's going
to be great.

114
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:56,501
Hello, sweetie.

115
00:04:56,536 --> 00:04:59,373
You ready to have
a great time with your dad?

116
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:00,878
No.

117
00:05:00,913 --> 00:05:02,507
Why not?

118
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,783
I don't feel so good.

119
00:05:04,822 --> 00:05:06,291
Really?

120
00:05:06,325 --> 00:05:08,296
Aw... tell Daddy what's wrong.

121
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:10,557
Ah!

122
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,732
Oh...

123
00:05:12,774 --> 00:05:15,679
Oh... you poor dear.

124
00:05:15,714 --> 00:05:18,551
I should never have given you
all that candy.

125
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:20,518
I usually make it a point
to drop by Quark's

126
00:07:20,554 --> 00:07:22,889
three or four times a day
at random intervals.

127
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:25,660
Just to let him know
I'm thinking about him

128
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:30,973
but seeing today is a holiday,
he'll be busier than usual.

129
00:07:31,013 --> 00:07:34,454
I suggest you station
a man there full time.

130
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:35,717
I think that about covers it.

131
00:07:35,824 --> 00:07:37,727
If you need me,
I'll be on the Promenade.

132
00:07:37,762 --> 00:07:41,203
But don't call
unless it's an emergency.

133
00:07:41,237 --> 00:07:44,734
The Constable will be occupied.

134
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:47,581
Madam Ambassador.

135
00:07:47,619 --> 00:07:51,116
Oh, do we have to be so formal?

136
00:07:55,805 --> 00:07:57,935
Didn't they teach you
any manners

137
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,640
in Starfleet Academy?

138
00:07:59,681 --> 00:08:01,652
Be a dear, run along.

139
00:08:01,685 --> 00:08:05,057
The Constable and I have
a lot of catching up to do.

140
00:08:05,094 --> 00:08:06,962
Uh, come back in five minutes.

141
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:08,993
Make that half an hour.

142
00:08:11,911 --> 00:08:14,144
So...

143
00:08:14,182 --> 00:08:16,415
what brings you to the station?

144
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,425
Well, officially I'm here

145
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:21,364
as the Betazoid representative
to the Gratitude Festival

146
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,932
but the truth is,
I came to see you

147
00:08:24,975 --> 00:08:27,412
you poor, sweet, tortured man.

148
00:08:27,447 --> 00:08:29,611
Excuse me?

149
00:08:29,653 --> 00:08:33,059
Oh, well, I know the torment
you must be going through.

150
00:08:33,094 --> 00:08:34,928
Well, to spend
your whole life searching

151
00:08:34,966 --> 00:08:36,697
for your people,
only to discover

152
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:40,302
that they're the leaders
of that awful Dominion.

153
00:08:40,345 --> 00:08:42,145
You heard about that.

154
00:08:42,183 --> 00:08:43,618
Odo...

155
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:44,986
don't worry.

156
00:08:45,023 --> 00:08:47,392
I'm here to help you.

157
00:08:47,428 --> 00:08:50,732
What kind of help
do you mean?

158
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,834
Oh, a sympathetic ear...

159
00:08:53,877 --> 00:08:56,577
a shoulder to cry on...

160
00:08:56,617 --> 00:08:58,451
a lap to melt in.

161
00:08:58,489 --> 00:09:00,517
Ah.

162
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,963
Well, that's
very considerate of you

163
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:04,468
but unnecessary.

164
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:06,268
My people are who they are.

165
00:09:06,307 --> 00:09:07,674
I am who I am.

166
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:09,648
I've learned to accept that.

167
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:13,681
Oh, you brave soul.

168
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:16,459
Oh, why don't we go
someplace quiet

169
00:09:16,498 --> 00:09:19,437
and you can tell me
all about it?

170
00:09:19,472 --> 00:09:22,274
Actually, I was planning
to attend the opening

171
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,841
of the Gratitude Festival
this afternoon.

172
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,445
Oh...

173
00:09:26,489 --> 00:09:28,392
well, even better.

174
00:09:28,427 --> 00:09:31,457
First, a little fun
and relaxation

175
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:36,137
and then we can delve
into the depths of your pain.

176
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:40,417
I'll freshen up and meet you
in front of the Bajoran Temple

177
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:42,893
for the Presider's
opening address.

178
00:09:45,134 --> 00:09:49,770
I promise you, Odo,
you'll never be alone again.

179
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,451
Level 23, Section 8.

180
00:10:06,485 --> 00:10:07,475
Oh!

181
00:10:12,432 --> 00:10:14,665
We need to see each other
more often.

182
00:10:14,704 --> 00:10:17,974
Hmm, I wish we both
weren't so busy.

183
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:25,085
I never expected
Kai Winn to make me

184
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:27,191
one of her principal advisors.

185
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:29,138
I think she asks your advice

186
00:10:29,173 --> 00:10:31,805
just so that she can
do the exact opposite

187
00:10:31,845 --> 00:10:33,474
of what you recommend.

188
00:10:33,516 --> 00:10:35,612
I know you don't like Winn

189
00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:38,492
but the office has changed her.

190
00:10:38,528 --> 00:10:41,524
The Prophets chose well.

191
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:43,733
So, why don't we leave

192
00:10:43,774 --> 00:10:47,442
spiritual matters
in their capable hands

193
00:10:47,483 --> 00:10:51,049
and uh, concentrate
on enjoying ourselves?

194
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,594
I have to go.

195
00:10:52,628 --> 00:10:56,330
The festival doesn't start
for an hour.

196
00:10:56,371 --> 00:10:59,903
But I have to set up the Renewal
Scrolls along the Promenade

197
00:10:59,947 --> 00:11:01,473
but it won't take long.

198
00:11:01,517 --> 00:11:03,351
Jadzia's promised to help me.

199
00:11:03,387 --> 00:11:04,856
Hmm. Jadzia, of course.

200
00:11:04,892 --> 00:11:05,986
I've never understood

201
00:11:06,027 --> 00:11:08,795
how the two of you
could be such good friends.

202
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,305
She's so...

203
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:12,810
unpredictable.

204
00:11:12,844 --> 00:11:14,473
And you're so...

205
00:11:14,514 --> 00:11:15,915
Predictable?

206
00:11:15,951 --> 00:11:17,979
I didn't mean it like that.

207
00:11:18,023 --> 00:11:19,458
It's just that she gets to spend

208
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:21,156
so much more time with you
than I do.

209
00:11:21,197 --> 00:11:25,299
Jadzia and I have been doing
this for the past two years.

210
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,311
It's becoming a tradition.

211
00:11:27,345 --> 00:11:30,945
I was hoping we could start
a few traditions of our own.

212
00:11:30,987 --> 00:11:32,684
We will...

213
00:11:32,724 --> 00:11:34,387
later tonight.

214
00:11:55,713 --> 00:11:57,239
Is she asleep?

215
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:58,412
It looks like the medicine

216
00:11:58,453 --> 00:12:00,390
Doctor Bashir prescribed
is working.

217
00:12:00,424 --> 00:12:02,418
Ooh, that's a relief.

218
00:12:06,238 --> 00:12:07,263
Rough trip?

219
00:12:07,308 --> 00:12:10,008
Oh, it was a disaster.

220
00:12:10,048 --> 00:12:13,489
I thought it would never end.

221
00:12:13,522 --> 00:12:15,516
Well...

222
00:12:17,165 --> 00:12:18,725
I'm glad you're home.

223
00:12:18,768 --> 00:12:21,239
Me, too.

224
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:22,868
We should get ready
for the festival.

225
00:12:22,912 --> 00:12:24,677
The baby-sitter will
be here any minute.

226
00:12:24,716 --> 00:12:27,712
Oh, the festival.

227
00:12:27,756 --> 00:12:29,590
On the other hand

228
00:12:29,628 --> 00:12:32,533
we could spend
the rest of the day

229
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:35,005
locked away in our quarters.

230
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:39,177
Miles, what I really
want to do is sleep.

231
00:12:39,285 --> 00:12:41,188
Well... then maybe you should.

232
00:12:41,255 --> 00:12:43,624
Miles, I didn't say
I was going to.

233
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:45,690
I just meant I could use some.

234
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:48,204
That's okay.

235
00:12:48,306 --> 00:12:49,900
If you need to sleep, go ahead.

236
00:12:49,943 --> 00:12:50,933
I'll understand.

237
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,175
No, you won't.

238
00:12:52,216 --> 00:12:53,446
You'll be disappointed

239
00:12:53,484 --> 00:12:54,612
and you'll start brooding

240
00:12:54,654 --> 00:12:56,750
and stomping around
like an Andorian bull.

241
00:12:56,793 --> 00:12:58,194
Look, go or stay

242
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,098
sleep or don't.

243
00:13:00,134 --> 00:13:01,694
It's all the same to me.

244
00:13:01,738 --> 00:13:04,107
Just tell me what you want
to do, and we'll do it.

245
00:13:04,143 --> 00:13:06,637
Miles, I've been making
decisions all day long.

246
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:07,708
You decide.

247
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:10,926
Okay.

248
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,589
We'll go to the festival

249
00:13:12,631 --> 00:13:15,034
but we don't have to go
right away.

250
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,132
I mean, you can take time
to relax and then change

251
00:13:17,174 --> 00:13:18,768
into something nice.

252
00:13:18,812 --> 00:13:20,577
Nice?

253
00:13:20,616 --> 00:13:22,416
Yeah.

254
00:13:22,454 --> 00:13:24,014
Like your red dress.

255
00:13:24,058 --> 00:13:25,687
My red dress?

256
00:13:25,728 --> 00:13:27,220
Really?

257
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,238
Is there something wrong
with your red dress?

258
00:13:30,273 --> 00:13:32,210
No. It's, it's...

259
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:35,013
just a little tight, that's all.

260
00:13:35,051 --> 00:13:37,751
Oh. That's why I like it.

261
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,260
All right.

262
00:13:39,294 --> 00:13:42,358
If it'll make you happy,
I'll wear the red dress.

263
00:13:42,402 --> 00:13:44,236
Look, forget
the red dress, okay?

264
00:13:44,273 --> 00:13:45,902
Just wear whatever you want.

265
00:13:45,944 --> 00:13:48,415
Look...

266
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,548
let's just try
to enjoy the next two days.

267
00:13:51,591 --> 00:13:53,824
I'll change into something nice

268
00:13:53,863 --> 00:13:56,461
and we'll go
to the festival, okay?

269
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,994
Fine.

270
00:14:00,445 --> 00:14:03,316
I can hardly wait.

271
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:44,210
<i>Tesra Peldor impatri bren.</i>

272
00:14:46,183 --> 00:14:52,255
<i>Bentel vetan ullon sten.</i>

273
00:14:58,312 --> 00:15:03,347
And now I have the honor

274
00:15:03,391 --> 00:15:08,529
of placing the first
Renewal Scroll into the fire.

275
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:12,603
As the scrolls burn

276
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:17,488
may our troubles
turn to ashes with them.

277
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:31,290
And now, for the next 26 hours

278
00:15:31,324 --> 00:15:34,890
I expect you all
to enjoy yourselves.

279
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:37,302
I know I will.

280
00:15:39,444 --> 00:15:41,711
May the Prophets walk with us.

281
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:00,888
Ah.

282
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:02,899
Jake, are you all right?

283
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,564
Uh, just felt funny
there for a second.

284
00:16:05,607 --> 00:16:08,705
You're sure you're all right?

285
00:16:08,747 --> 00:16:10,376
Yeah, Dad.

286
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:14,418
Never felt better.

287
00:16:25,621 --> 00:16:26,817
Bareil?

288
00:16:26,858 --> 00:16:28,487
What are you looking for?

289
00:16:28,528 --> 00:16:29,792
Hmm?

290
00:16:29,831 --> 00:16:31,266
Oh, nothing.

291
00:16:31,302 --> 00:16:32,737
Just...

292
00:16:32,772 --> 00:16:33,831
just looking.

293
00:16:33,874 --> 00:16:35,537
Hmm.

294
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:36,673
<i>Peldor joi.</i>

295
00:16:36,714 --> 00:16:38,274
Oh, Jake, how thoughtful.

296
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:39,447
Thank you.

297
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:40,615
Uh, I know you're busy

298
00:16:40,657 --> 00:16:42,457
but can I talk to you
for a second?

299
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,930
Sure.

300
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:46,233
In private.
It's kind of personal.

301
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:47,706
Oh, um...

302
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:50,771
I'll be right back.

303
00:16:50,815 --> 00:16:54,119
Now, Jake,
what can I do for you?

304
00:16:54,156 --> 00:16:56,423
Uh...

305
00:16:56,462 --> 00:16:57,931
I need some advice.

306
00:16:57,965 --> 00:16:59,559
You see, there's
this older woman

307
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,698
and I think we're
perfect for each other.

308
00:17:01,741 --> 00:17:03,974
Ah... and she doesn't.

309
00:17:04,014 --> 00:17:05,848
I don't know what she thinks.

310
00:17:05,884 --> 00:17:09,586
Well, Jake, my advice to you
is to tell Mardah how you feel.

311
00:17:09,626 --> 00:17:11,220
That way you'll know...

312
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:12,995
Mardah and I broke up.

313
00:17:13,035 --> 00:17:14,732
You broke up?

314
00:17:14,773 --> 00:17:16,470
Well, then, who?

315
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,413
You.

316
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,018
Me?

317
00:17:22,357 --> 00:17:25,023
I love you, Nerys.

318
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,624
Want to go out with me?

319
00:17:33,216 --> 00:17:34,651
Morn, it's hard to believe

320
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,315
a handsome, fun-loving
guy like you

321
00:17:36,357 --> 00:17:38,225
could have so many problems.

322
00:17:38,261 --> 00:17:39,821
My advice to you is to burn this

323
00:17:39,866 --> 00:17:42,839
as quickly as possible
and don't look back.

324
00:17:49,555 --> 00:17:51,423
Sage advice.

325
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,554
Vedek Bareil.

326
00:17:52,597 --> 00:17:53,622
It's good to see you.

327
00:17:53,665 --> 00:17:58,473
Oh, you have such
a wise, generous spirit.

328
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,778
I only wish I had
a friend like you.

329
00:18:00,816 --> 00:18:02,342
I think of you as a friend.

330
00:18:02,386 --> 00:18:04,357
You mean that?

331
00:18:04,391 --> 00:18:06,385
Of course.

332
00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:07,955
Oh, I'm glad

333
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,335
because I was hoping
that you and I

334
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:13,504
could get to know each other
a little better.

335
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,160
A lot better.

336
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,669
Excuse me.

337
00:18:50,836 --> 00:18:53,307
I love Bajoran music.

338
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,975
It's so intelligent,
so vital...

339
00:18:57,018 --> 00:18:59,512
It reminds me of you.

340
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:02,290
Oh, dance with me, Odo.

341
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,665
I'm sorry.
I don't dance.

342
00:19:04,702 --> 00:19:06,137
Nonsense.

343
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:08,301
I saw you moving to the music.

344
00:19:08,344 --> 00:19:10,075
That wasn't dancing.

345
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:11,880
That was... swaying.

346
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,013
Oh...

347
00:19:13,056 --> 00:19:15,927
then sway with me, Odo.

348
00:19:15,963 --> 00:19:17,763
Sway with me.

349
00:19:17,801 --> 00:19:19,669
I just remembered.

350
00:19:19,705 --> 00:19:22,176
I'm needed in Security.

351
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:23,908
Oh.

352
00:19:23,948 --> 00:19:26,112
I'll come with you.

353
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,759
Ah, hello, Lieutenant.

354
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,194
Having a good time?

355
00:19:30,297 --> 00:19:31,766
No.

356
00:19:39,452 --> 00:19:41,012
That's right.

357
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:45,431
Genuine latinum-plated
Renewal Scroll inscription pens

358
00:19:45,466 --> 00:19:49,636
blessed by Vedek Redab himself
shortly before he passed away.

359
00:19:49,676 --> 00:19:51,373
Each pen is engraved
with the words

360
00:19:51,415 --> 00:19:55,049
"Deep Space 9's Third Annual
Gratitude Festival"

361
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,995
today's date and a lovely
portrait of the station

362
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,522
by Ermat Zimm.

363
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:01,401
So, get them while you can!

364
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:04,071
They're sure to become
collectors' items.

365
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:15,266
Oh!

366
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:24,420
So...

367
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,986
what do you say we take a walk

368
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,727
around the Promenade
for a while?

369
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:29,567
I'd rather stay here.

370
00:20:29,606 --> 00:20:34,346
I-I never thought I'd say this,
but I kind of miss Quark's.

371
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:36,718
The noise, the excitement...

372
00:20:36,756 --> 00:20:38,350
our table.

373
00:20:40,465 --> 00:20:41,934
You know...

374
00:20:41,968 --> 00:20:44,566
I haven't sat here
since you've been gone.

375
00:20:44,608 --> 00:20:48,481
Oh, that's so sweet.

376
00:20:49,654 --> 00:20:51,522
So, how's the survey been going?

377
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:54,532
Uh... the terrain's
rougher than we expected

378
00:20:54,566 --> 00:20:57,037
and the ecosystem's
a lot more diverse

379
00:20:57,071 --> 00:20:59,635
than it looked from
the orbital scans.

380
00:20:59,678 --> 00:21:02,242
All in all, it's been
pretty grueling.

381
00:21:02,284 --> 00:21:03,878
Really?

382
00:21:03,921 --> 00:21:05,515
Don't get me wrong.

383
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:07,961
I'm having a wonderful time.

384
00:21:07,998 --> 00:21:09,729
That's good.

385
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,174
There is one problem
I have to talk to you about.

386
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:17,083
It looks like the project's
taking longer than we hoped.

387
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,024
What do you mean, "longer"?

388
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,666
You have to understand, Miles

389
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:25,262
every valley has an entirely
different ecosystem.

390
00:21:25,308 --> 00:21:27,745
There's a lot of work
to be done.

391
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,753
But how much longer
is it going to take?

392
00:21:30,788 --> 00:21:32,918
I'm... I'm not sure.

393
00:21:33,026 --> 00:21:34,495
Try a guess.

394
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,124
Uh, you know,
an extra couple of days?

395
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:37,568
A week? Two?

396
00:21:37,604 --> 00:21:40,840
More like two or three months.

397
00:21:40,879 --> 00:21:42,178
You're telling me

398
00:21:42,215 --> 00:21:45,382
you're going to be on Bajor
for another seven months.

399
00:21:45,422 --> 00:21:48,919
It's either that or ask them
to find another botanist.

400
00:21:48,964 --> 00:21:51,299
Maybe that's something
worth considering.

401
00:21:51,336 --> 00:21:53,500
Are you asking me to resign?

402
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:54,841
No...

403
00:21:54,878 --> 00:21:56,712
but seven more months?

404
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,088
I don't like this
any more than you do.

405
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,925
You just said you were
having a great time.

406
00:22:01,995 --> 00:22:03,259
Oh, I'm sorry.

407
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:05,931
I suppose you'd be happier
if I were miserable?

408
00:22:06,005 --> 00:22:08,876
I didn't say that.

409
00:22:11,752 --> 00:22:13,381
Sebarr was right.

410
00:22:13,423 --> 00:22:15,291
I never should've mentioned it.

411
00:22:15,328 --> 00:22:16,957
Who's Sebarr?

412
00:22:17,065 --> 00:22:19,263
He's one of the zoologists
I'm working with.

413
00:22:19,303 --> 00:22:21,969
He warned me
not to talk to you about this

414
00:22:22,077 --> 00:22:24,241
until after
the Gratitude Festival.

415
00:22:24,282 --> 00:22:26,344
And who's he to be
giving you advice?

416
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,152
He's a friend.

417
00:22:28,192 --> 00:22:29,855
A friend?

418
00:22:31,332 --> 00:22:32,961
I thought you were
down there working.

419
00:22:33,004 --> 00:22:34,769
We are working.

420
00:22:34,807 --> 00:22:36,106
Yeah, with time out

421
00:22:36,144 --> 00:22:38,708
for intimate little chats
about our relationship?

422
00:22:38,751 --> 00:22:40,984
What else did you
tell him about us?

423
00:22:42,593 --> 00:22:45,361
Miles, you're behaving
like a child.

424
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,530
What do you want me to say?

425
00:22:47,571 --> 00:22:49,769
I want you to say

426
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,906
that you're not going back...

427
00:22:51,949 --> 00:22:54,284
that you're going
to stay here with me.

428
00:22:55,324 --> 00:22:56,918
Miles, right now

429
00:22:56,961 --> 00:22:59,991
I don't even want to sit
at the same table with you.

430
00:23:00,034 --> 00:23:02,335
Fine.

431
00:23:02,374 --> 00:23:03,673
Well, go on.

432
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,236
Leave.

433
00:23:05,281 --> 00:23:09,280
Go back to Bajor and your plants
and Sebarr.

434
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,797
See if I care!

435
00:23:38,593 --> 00:23:39,994
Whoa!

436
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,001
Slow down.

437
00:23:42,035 --> 00:23:43,368
Hi, Dad.

438
00:23:43,405 --> 00:23:44,897
I've been looking
all over for you.

439
00:23:44,942 --> 00:23:46,673
In case you've forgotten,
we're hosting

440
00:23:46,713 --> 00:23:48,707
a Gratitude Dinner
tonight in the Wardroom.

441
00:23:48,751 --> 00:23:50,654
I could use your help
in getting ready.

442
00:23:50,689 --> 00:23:52,022
I'm kind of busy right now, Dad.

443
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:53,118
I-I have to find someone.

444
00:23:53,196 --> 00:23:54,563
Oh, Major Kira?

445
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,589
How'd you know?

446
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:56,602
I just spoke to her.

447
00:23:56,636 --> 00:23:57,626
Really? Where is she?

448
00:23:57,673 --> 00:23:59,233
Ah, just hold on!

449
00:23:59,276 --> 00:24:00,404
But I have to talk to her.

450
00:24:00,446 --> 00:24:01,847
You know, you were
right about me

451
00:24:01,883 --> 00:24:03,250
meeting someone at the festival.

452
00:24:03,286 --> 00:24:05,280
I did not mean Major Kira.

453
00:24:05,325 --> 00:24:06,624
You like her, don't you?

454
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,095
Well, of course I like her.

455
00:24:08,132 --> 00:24:09,499
Well, so do I.

456
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:14,445
Jake, what you're feeling now
is just a crush.

457
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:16,780
Look, Jake...

458
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:21,286
right now...

459
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:24,131
you are confused,
vulnerable, hurt.

460
00:24:24,203 --> 00:24:25,672
You miss Mardah.

461
00:24:25,706 --> 00:24:27,141
Mardah was a mistake.

462
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,647
She was too young,
too immature for me.

463
00:24:29,683 --> 00:24:31,152
Major Kira is a woman.

464
00:24:31,253 --> 00:24:33,690
Major Kira is in love
with Vedek Bareil.

465
00:24:33,725 --> 00:24:35,992
It won't last.
He's always on Bajor.

466
00:24:36,032 --> 00:24:39,370
She needs someone who can be
with her all the time, like me.

467
00:24:39,406 --> 00:24:43,348
Jake, I don't want
to see you hurt again.

468
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:45,410
I appreciate that.

469
00:24:45,454 --> 00:24:48,826
But this is
between Nerys and me.

470
00:24:48,861 --> 00:24:49,829
Don't worry.

471
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:51,424
Everything's going to be fine.

472
00:24:51,468 --> 00:24:53,666
Thanks.

473
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,774
I really can't accept this.

474
00:24:57,817 --> 00:25:00,015
But I want you to have it.
It's my gift to you.

475
00:25:00,055 --> 00:25:01,855
Well, that's
very thoughtful of you

476
00:25:01,893 --> 00:25:03,955
but I have nothing
to give you in return.

477
00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:07,565
Being with you
is the only present I need.

478
00:25:07,607 --> 00:25:09,099
Now, come on.

479
00:25:09,144 --> 00:25:11,547
Let's go write
our Renewal Scrolls.

480
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:28,322
<i>Peldor joi,</i> Chief.

481
00:25:28,357 --> 00:25:30,225
You look terrible.

482
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:32,892
It's just a little headache,
that's all.

483
00:25:32,934 --> 00:25:36,397
Here.
Have a free pen.

484
00:25:36,443 --> 00:25:38,243
What for?

485
00:25:38,281 --> 00:25:41,015
To write down your problems
on a Renewal Scroll.

486
00:25:41,053 --> 00:25:43,753
There isn't a scroll long enough
for all my problems.

487
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:46,264
Really? I thought
you could sum them up

488
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,100
with one word...

489
00:25:48,137 --> 00:25:50,108
Keiko.

490
00:25:50,142 --> 00:25:51,543
Tell me I'm wrong.

491
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:54,849
If you ask me,
it's your own fault.

492
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,917
You never should have let her
go to Bajor in the first place.

493
00:25:57,961 --> 00:25:59,089
What was I supposed to do?

494
00:25:59,131 --> 00:26:00,464
Force her to stay here with me?

495
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:02,335
That would have been
a good start.

496
00:26:02,371 --> 00:26:04,842
You hu-mans, you never learn.

497
00:26:04,878 --> 00:26:07,247
You let your women
go out in public,

498
00:26:07,283 --> 00:26:10,985
hold jobs, wear clothing

499
00:26:11,025 --> 00:26:13,258
and you wonder why your
marriages fall apart.

500
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:15,268
That's your solution,
Quark, huh?

501
00:26:15,369 --> 00:26:17,363
Treat women like property?

502
00:26:17,407 --> 00:26:21,075
Criticize it all you want,
but on the Ferengi homeworld

503
00:26:21,116 --> 00:26:23,485
husbands and wives never argue.

504
00:26:23,522 --> 00:26:27,190
There's no divorce,
no broken homes

505
00:26:27,231 --> 00:26:31,435
nothing but peaceful
conjugal bliss.

506
00:26:31,475 --> 00:26:34,414
If Ferengi marriages
are so wonderful

507
00:26:34,448 --> 00:26:36,316
why are you still single?

508
00:26:36,353 --> 00:26:39,725
I haven't met
the right woman yet.

509
00:26:39,761 --> 00:26:42,325
Well, I have.

510
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:45,465
She just walked out that door.

511
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:47,844
And out of your life.

512
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,822
Not if I can help it.

513
00:27:05,188 --> 00:27:06,782
Bareil!

514
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:10,266
I was wondering
where you disappeared to.

515
00:27:10,301 --> 00:27:13,035
Come on, you can
do better than that.

516
00:27:13,074 --> 00:27:15,045
Someone might see us.

517
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:17,881
We are the only people here.

518
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,382
Everyone else is
on the Promenade.

519
00:27:25,871 --> 00:27:28,503
We have two hours
before we're supposed

520
00:27:28,545 --> 00:27:30,914
to join Commander Sisko
for dinner.

521
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:34,048
That gives us some time
to be alone together.

522
00:27:34,091 --> 00:27:37,087
I... I can't. Um...

523
00:27:37,132 --> 00:27:38,362
Why not?

524
00:27:38,402 --> 00:27:40,498
I have to find Jadzia.

525
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,602
Jadzia?
Is there something wrong?

526
00:27:42,645 --> 00:27:44,114
No, not at all.

527
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:45,778
Do you know where she is?

528
00:27:45,819 --> 00:27:48,587
She's probably
on the Promenade.

529
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:51,360
She wasn't there
the last time I looked.

530
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,841
Why is it so important
for you to see Jadzia?

531
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:57,575
I'll explain everything later.

532
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,049
Uh...

533
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,456
Thank you, Nerys.

534
00:28:02,589 --> 00:28:03,853
For what?

535
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:06,226
For being such a good friend.

536
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:12,179
Friend?

537
00:28:14,785 --> 00:28:16,254
Dax...

538
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:17,815
what are you doing here?

539
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,523
I thought you might
need some help

540
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:20,897
getting ready for the party.

541
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:23,165
Thanks, but that
won't be necessary.

542
00:28:23,205 --> 00:28:25,335
Wouldn't you rather
be celebrating

543
00:28:25,377 --> 00:28:26,846
on the Promenade?

544
00:28:26,881 --> 00:28:27,849
No, thanks.

545
00:28:27,884 --> 00:28:30,321
I don't want to run
into Vedek Bareil.

546
00:28:30,356 --> 00:28:32,920
Oh, is there
a problem between you?

547
00:28:32,963 --> 00:28:35,902
He can't keep his hands off me.

548
00:28:35,936 --> 00:28:38,568
That doesn't sound
like Vedek Bareil.

549
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:42,552
I couldn't believe it myself,
but he wouldn't leave me alone.

550
00:28:42,585 --> 00:28:45,649
He's probably still out
there looking for me.

551
00:28:45,693 --> 00:28:47,789
Have you told Kira?

552
00:28:47,832 --> 00:28:49,735
I don't know how.

553
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:52,970
It's going to break her heart.

554
00:28:53,011 --> 00:28:55,107
Someone has to tell her.

555
00:28:56,786 --> 00:28:58,757
Do you want me to do it?

556
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:00,283
Would you?

557
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,462
Well...

558
00:29:04,505 --> 00:29:07,843
if you think that's the
best way to handle it.

559
00:29:09,182 --> 00:29:11,676
I'd really appreciate it,
Benjamin.

560
00:29:11,722 --> 00:29:14,388
I mean, this whole thing
is ridiculous.

561
00:29:14,429 --> 00:29:16,832
How could I be
interested in Bareil?

562
00:29:18,271 --> 00:29:19,763
We both know...

563
00:29:19,808 --> 00:29:22,006
it's always been you.

564
00:29:36,147 --> 00:29:37,343
Dax...

565
00:29:37,383 --> 00:29:38,579
Hmm?

566
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,385
What are you doing?

567
00:29:40,424 --> 00:29:42,918
Making myself comfortable.

568
00:29:44,768 --> 00:29:48,174
Have I ever told you
that you smell wonderful?

569
00:29:50,715 --> 00:29:53,186
Oh...

570
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:58,732
Ah, you know, old man,
I have to admit

571
00:29:58,768 --> 00:30:01,536
you had me going there
for a minute.

572
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,081
Benjamin, stop acting so coy.

573
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:08,181
There's no one around.

574
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:09,557
I have an idea.

575
00:30:09,594 --> 00:30:12,932
You cancel the party,
and then, that way

576
00:30:12,969 --> 00:30:15,099
we can spend the evening
alone together.

577
00:30:15,141 --> 00:30:16,804
What do you say?

578
00:30:16,845 --> 00:30:18,041
Oh... uh...

579
00:30:18,081 --> 00:30:19,550
Sisko to Bashir.

580
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:21,077
Go ahead, Commander.

581
00:30:21,121 --> 00:30:23,524
Meet me in the Infirmary
immediately.

582
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,961
Aye, sir.

583
00:30:24,997 --> 00:30:28,129
Her vital signs are normal.

584
00:30:28,205 --> 00:30:30,142
Her brain activity is normal.

585
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:33,149
No sign of infection
or intoxication of any kind.

586
00:30:33,217 --> 00:30:34,982
She's the picture of health.

587
00:30:35,021 --> 00:30:36,388
Told you.

588
00:30:36,424 --> 00:30:38,861
Then why did you put your head
on my chest?

589
00:30:38,898 --> 00:30:40,629
Oh, Julian,
you should have seen his face.

590
00:30:40,668 --> 00:30:42,730
Admit it, you were
this far away from total panic.

591
00:30:42,773 --> 00:30:45,837
I think we've both been
victims of a practical joke.

592
00:30:45,881 --> 00:30:48,786
At least someone around here
has a sense of humor.

593
00:30:48,821 --> 00:30:52,193
Um, see you at the party,
Julian.

594
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,653
I've never been
so embarrassed in all my life...

595
00:31:03,691 --> 00:31:05,559
making me go through
all those tests.

596
00:31:05,594 --> 00:31:07,120
It's your fault, Dax.

597
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,828
You took this one too far.

598
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:10,840
Oh, if I didn't
love you so much

599
00:31:10,874 --> 00:31:12,173
I'd be angry with you.

600
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:13,770
See you at the party.

601
00:31:28,149 --> 00:31:31,521
You look like you could use
a little cheering up.

602
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,684
Jake, do me a favor.

603
00:31:32,726 --> 00:31:34,025
Anything.

604
00:31:34,063 --> 00:31:35,191
Leave me alone.

605
00:31:35,233 --> 00:31:36,725
Uh...

606
00:31:54,244 --> 00:31:55,543
Hi, sweetie.

607
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:56,880
Hi.

608
00:31:56,918 --> 00:31:58,217
Feeling better?

609
00:31:58,254 --> 00:31:59,587
Lots better.

610
00:31:59,624 --> 00:32:01,355
Ah, that's what
I wanted to hear.

611
00:32:02,898 --> 00:32:04,801
Where's Mommy?

612
00:32:04,837 --> 00:32:06,740
In her room, sad.

613
00:32:06,775 --> 00:32:09,680
Oh. Well, listen, why don't you
go and play with Piggy

614
00:32:09,715 --> 00:32:11,446
in your room for a while

615
00:32:11,486 --> 00:32:15,018
and we'll see if Daddy
can cheer Mommy up, huh?

616
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:29,260
Keiko, it's me.

617
00:32:29,295 --> 00:32:30,764
Can I come in?

618
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:32,632
Not now, Miles.

619
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:37,004
You're right.

620
00:32:37,047 --> 00:32:39,041
I'm an idiot... sometimes.

621
00:32:39,085 --> 00:32:41,056
If I don't get my own way

622
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:44,553
I can be selfish
and childish and pigheaded.

623
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:48,267
I said some things to you
that were pretty stupid.

624
00:32:48,308 --> 00:32:50,802
I wish I could take them back.

625
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:01,470
But even if it's too late
for that, I...

626
00:33:01,505 --> 00:33:05,002
There's one thing
I want you to know, Keiko...

627
00:33:05,047 --> 00:33:06,676
I... I love you.

628
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:09,283
I always have,
and I always will.

629
00:33:12,265 --> 00:33:15,329
I want you to know I've left
a letter of resignation

630
00:33:15,406 --> 00:33:17,240
on Commander Sisko's desk.

631
00:33:17,277 --> 00:33:20,250
I'm ready to move down to Bajor
with you tomorrow

632
00:33:20,284 --> 00:33:21,913
if you'll have me.

633
00:33:21,955 --> 00:33:24,951
And after that, if you want
to move back to Earth

634
00:33:24,995 --> 00:33:26,521
that's okay, too.

635
00:33:26,565 --> 00:33:29,367
I'll do whatever it takes.

636
00:33:29,439 --> 00:33:32,139
I just don't want to lose you.

637
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:37,751
Honey, did you hear
what I said?

638
00:33:37,793 --> 00:33:39,558
Yes.

639
00:33:39,596 --> 00:33:42,067
And?

640
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,732
And I need time to think.

641
00:33:43,773 --> 00:33:46,974
Why don't you go
to Commander Sisko's party?

642
00:33:47,015 --> 00:33:49,077
We can talk when you get back.

643
00:33:52,127 --> 00:33:54,121
If that's what you want.

644
00:33:58,676 --> 00:33:59,644
Major...

645
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:00,647
Ah!

646
00:34:00,681 --> 00:34:02,675
Aren't you headed
in the wrong direction?

647
00:34:03,755 --> 00:34:05,054
Commander Sisko's party?

648
00:34:05,091 --> 00:34:06,219
Oh, I'm not going.

649
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:07,730
Why ever not?

650
00:34:07,765 --> 00:34:09,394
Because Bareil will be there.

651
00:34:09,502 --> 00:34:11,735
I thought the two of you
were very happy together.

652
00:34:11,774 --> 00:34:14,611
So did I, but it turns out
he'd rather be with Dax than me.

653
00:34:14,647 --> 00:34:17,586
And to make matters worse,
I have Jake Sisko chasing me

654
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:20,220
around the station
professing his undying love.

655
00:34:20,261 --> 00:34:21,924
Well, that's strange.

656
00:34:21,965 --> 00:34:24,870
A little while ago, Jadzia
had Commander Sisko convinced

657
00:34:24,906 --> 00:34:26,398
that she was
in love with him.

658
00:34:26,443 --> 00:34:29,314
He even had me examine her
to make sure she was all right.

659
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:30,443
Apparently, it was only a joke.

660
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:32,616
Well, are you sure?

661
00:34:32,658 --> 00:34:34,754
People are acting
very strangely today.

662
00:34:34,796 --> 00:34:36,561
Maybe I should
take another look

663
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,263
at Jadzia's test results.

664
00:34:38,305 --> 00:34:39,467
Excuse me.

665
00:34:39,507 --> 00:34:41,375
Constable, would you
tell Commander Sisko

666
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,246
that I'll be a little late?

667
00:34:49,331 --> 00:34:52,669
Oh, I should be getting
to the Infirmary.

668
00:34:52,706 --> 00:34:54,335
I'll join you.

669
00:34:54,376 --> 00:34:56,940
Maybe you should
examine Bareil and Jake

670
00:34:56,983 --> 00:34:58,247
while you're at it.

671
00:34:58,285 --> 00:35:00,119
That wouldn't be a bad idea.

672
00:35:02,596 --> 00:35:05,262
Oh, this won't take long.

673
00:35:17,635 --> 00:35:19,070
Oh, what is it, Odo?

674
00:35:19,105 --> 00:35:20,802
I may not be able
to read your emotions

675
00:35:20,842 --> 00:35:22,243
but I can read your expression.

676
00:35:22,279 --> 00:35:23,338
Something's wrong.

677
00:35:23,382 --> 00:35:24,646
I'm fine.

678
00:35:24,684 --> 00:35:26,655
I wish you'd tell me
what's bothering you.

679
00:35:26,689 --> 00:35:27,885
Maybe it would help you.

680
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:29,327
As soon as something
bothers me

681
00:35:29,362 --> 00:35:30,854
I'll let you know,
I promise.

682
00:35:30,899 --> 00:35:32,893
Why do I find stubborn
men so attractive?

683
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:38,279
Would you please
stop following me?

684
00:35:38,317 --> 00:35:41,313
Oh, gladly, if you'll
just stop running away.

685
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:44,297
I-I-I have something
very important

686
00:35:44,332 --> 00:35:46,132
to talk to you about.

687
00:35:46,169 --> 00:35:47,365
Discuss it with Major Kira.

688
00:35:47,405 --> 00:35:49,034
I'm not interested.

689
00:35:51,081 --> 00:35:53,314
But, Dad, you promised
that Nerys would be here!

690
00:35:53,353 --> 00:35:56,121
She will, and stop
calling her Nerys.

691
00:35:57,296 --> 00:35:59,597
<i>Peldor joi.</i>

692
00:35:59,635 --> 00:36:01,264
Oh, Commander, I didn't realize

693
00:36:01,306 --> 00:36:03,938
that you and Lieutenant Dax
were that close.

694
00:36:03,978 --> 00:36:04,968
We're not.

695
00:36:05,015 --> 00:36:07,282
Sisko to Bashir.

696
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,225
Computer, locate Dr. Bashir.

697
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,996
Dr. Bashir is in the Infirmary.

698
00:36:14,036 --> 00:36:17,670
Constable, go get Dr. Bashir,
and bring him here immediately.

699
00:36:17,712 --> 00:36:19,774
I'll be right back.

700
00:36:19,816 --> 00:36:21,684
I'll go with you.

701
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:24,215
Yes, of course you will.

702
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:29,137
I wonder
what Commander Sisko wanted.

703
00:36:29,173 --> 00:36:30,574
Oh, it can wait.

704
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,546
This is very embarrassing.

705
00:36:35,588 --> 00:36:37,684
Yes, we have to stop.

706
00:36:37,727 --> 00:36:39,253
Definitely.

707
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,933
Doctor!

708
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,952
Commander Sisko needs to see you
in the Wardroom.

709
00:36:49,989 --> 00:36:51,458
Oh, tell him...

710
00:36:51,493 --> 00:36:53,794
Oh, tell him
I'll be there shortly.

711
00:36:53,831 --> 00:36:55,130
Now, Doctor!

712
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,637
You'd better go.

713
00:36:58,275 --> 00:36:59,744
Right.

714
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:05,581
<i>Peldor joi.</i>

715
00:37:09,202 --> 00:37:11,731
Please, Commander, step aside.

716
00:37:11,774 --> 00:37:14,007
I need to speak to Jadzia.

717
00:37:14,046 --> 00:37:16,848
I don't think
she wants to speak with you.

718
00:37:16,953 --> 00:37:18,753
You tell him, Benjamin.

719
00:37:18,791 --> 00:37:21,628
I... I only want
to give her this.

720
00:37:21,665 --> 00:37:23,602
A Bajoran betrothal bracelet?

721
00:37:23,636 --> 00:37:26,200
It's been in my family
for generations.

722
00:37:26,242 --> 00:37:27,768
Can I see that?

723
00:37:30,552 --> 00:37:31,851
I...

724
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:33,792
Nerys! Am I glad to see you.

725
00:37:33,827 --> 00:37:35,126
Doctor...

726
00:37:35,164 --> 00:37:36,428
I need your help!

727
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:37,868
And I need yours, too.

728
00:37:37,904 --> 00:37:40,171
You've got to get me
away from Kira.

729
00:37:40,209 --> 00:37:42,077
I can't, ah, keep
my hands off of her.

730
00:37:42,114 --> 00:37:45,178
What's worse,
I can't keep my hands off him.

731
00:37:52,205 --> 00:37:54,676
I can't explain it either.

732
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:57,877
Oh... oh.

733
00:38:11,852 --> 00:38:13,880
She doesn't love me.

734
00:38:13,923 --> 00:38:15,654
Who?

735
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:17,186
Nerys.

736
00:38:21,241 --> 00:38:22,801
You're better off.

737
00:38:22,844 --> 00:38:25,544
In the end, they only
break your heart.

738
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:31,394
Although,
sometimes it's worth it.

739
00:38:41,523 --> 00:38:43,653
What do you think?

740
00:38:43,695 --> 00:38:45,723
You look beautiful.

741
00:38:45,767 --> 00:38:47,430
Did you really mean it

742
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,668
about turning in
your resignation?

743
00:38:49,709 --> 00:38:51,303
Mm-hmm.

744
00:38:51,346 --> 00:38:56,256
Well, you'd better get it back
before Commander Sisko sees it.

745
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:59,823
It was very nice
of you to offer.

746
00:39:08,153 --> 00:39:11,525
I love you so much.

747
00:39:16,172 --> 00:39:18,609
Hey!

748
00:39:18,644 --> 00:39:20,113
Oh...

749
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:22,017
Ooh...

750
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,752
Commander, here's that
I'danian spice pudding

751
00:39:24,793 --> 00:39:26,262
you ordered.

752
00:39:26,296 --> 00:39:29,896
I want to give this to you
as a token of my affection.

753
00:39:29,938 --> 00:39:31,134
Oh, no, you don't!

754
00:39:31,175 --> 00:39:33,669
Bareil, listen to me...

755
00:39:33,715 --> 00:39:35,378
I'll fight for her

756
00:39:35,419 --> 00:39:37,253
if I have to!

757
00:39:42,803 --> 00:39:44,637
Oh, I'm sorry, Benjamin.

758
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:47,077
He was just starting
to annoy me.

759
00:39:47,146 --> 00:39:48,547
Commander...

760
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:52,251
you throw one hell of a party.

761
00:39:52,293 --> 00:39:53,592
Pudding, anyone?

762
00:39:53,628 --> 00:39:55,656
I've got I'danian spice pudding.

763
00:39:57,003 --> 00:39:59,270
Are you all right?

764
00:40:02,249 --> 00:40:04,117
Pudding, anyone?

765
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:06,125
Doctor?

766
00:40:06,226 --> 00:40:08,060
Pudding, anyone?

767
00:40:08,097 --> 00:40:09,259
No, no, thank you.

768
00:40:09,299 --> 00:40:10,859
Ooh!

769
00:40:10,904 --> 00:40:12,396
Ah!

770
00:40:19,591 --> 00:40:21,494
I'll take one.

771
00:40:21,529 --> 00:40:24,127
Help yourself.

772
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,944
Why did she hit me?

773
00:40:30,384 --> 00:40:32,412
Oh, forget about him.

774
00:40:32,455 --> 00:40:33,822
What about me?

775
00:40:33,859 --> 00:40:35,419
I need you, Keiko.

776
00:40:35,462 --> 00:40:38,435
My ears tingle
at the sight of you.

777
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:39,995
Marry me.

778
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,669
She's taken, Quark!

779
00:40:43,181 --> 00:40:44,650
Easy, Chief.

780
00:40:44,685 --> 00:40:47,122
He doesn't know
what he's doing.

781
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:52,835
What are you looking at me for?

782
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,339
Zanthi fever?

783
00:40:54,374 --> 00:40:55,866
Oh, that's ridiculous.

784
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,244
That, that's impossible.

785
00:40:57,314 --> 00:40:59,547
That only affects
older Betazoids.

786
00:40:59,587 --> 00:41:02,024
Well, that may be, but
according to my tests

787
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:03,859
you show all the symptoms.

788
00:41:03,897 --> 00:41:05,560
Zanthi fever is a virus

789
00:41:05,601 --> 00:41:07,366
which affects
the empathic abilities of...

790
00:41:07,406 --> 00:41:09,604
um... mature Betazoids.

791
00:41:09,645 --> 00:41:12,709
It causes them to project
their emotions onto others.

792
00:41:12,752 --> 00:41:14,517
Then Mrs. Troi's
amorous feelings

793
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:16,185
for... someone on the station

794
00:41:16,227 --> 00:41:18,961
were being passed along
to the people around her?

795
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,333
Well, not everyone.

796
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:22,204
Only those within
close proximity to her

797
00:41:22,241 --> 00:41:23,938
when she had an attack,
and even then

798
00:41:23,979 --> 00:41:25,471
there would have
had to have been

799
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:27,145
some preexisting
latent attraction.

800
00:41:27,186 --> 00:41:29,954
You're saying Dax?

801
00:41:29,993 --> 00:41:31,861
Only on a subconscious level.

802
00:41:31,898 --> 00:41:33,994
Best not think about it
too much, if you ask me.

803
00:41:34,036 --> 00:41:36,668
I am terribly sorry, Commander.

804
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:38,704
I hope I haven't caused
too much trouble.

805
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:42,279
I'm sure no permanent harm
was done... right, Doctor?

806
00:41:42,389 --> 00:41:44,257
Oh, a simple wide-spectrum
antiviral agent

807
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:45,262
should cure Mrs. Troi.

808
00:41:45,297 --> 00:41:46,391
And as for everyone else

809
00:41:46,432 --> 00:41:48,197
well, they'll be back to normal
in a day or two.

810
00:41:48,237 --> 00:41:49,638
Excuse me.

811
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,200
I promised Nerys
that I'd meet her

812
00:41:51,244 --> 00:41:52,611
in her quarters this evening.

813
00:41:52,647 --> 00:41:56,247
I think you ought
to postpone that visit

814
00:41:56,289 --> 00:41:57,883
for a day or two.

815
00:42:00,629 --> 00:42:02,532
Commander's Log, supplemental.

816
00:42:02,568 --> 00:42:05,405
I'm happy to report
that Dr. Bashir's diagnosis

817
00:42:05,441 --> 00:42:06,933
has been proven correct.

818
00:42:06,978 --> 00:42:08,778
My son
and all the others affected

819
00:42:08,882 --> 00:42:12,618
by Mrs. Troi's condition
have made full recoveries.

820
00:42:14,028 --> 00:42:15,793
This is one Gratitude Festival

821
00:42:15,865 --> 00:42:18,029
they'll be talking
about for a long time.

822
00:42:18,071 --> 00:42:20,133
I know I'll never forget it.

823
00:42:20,176 --> 00:42:23,617
I hope everything
works out for you, Odo...

824
00:42:23,651 --> 00:42:25,314
with Major Kira.

825
00:42:25,356 --> 00:42:27,520
I... don't know what you mean.

826
00:42:27,561 --> 00:42:28,757
Oh, don't worry.

827
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,824
Your secret's safe with me.

828
00:42:30,868 --> 00:42:33,237
After all, I know what it's like

829
00:42:33,274 --> 00:42:36,976
to be attracted to someone
who doesn't necessarily

830
00:42:37,017 --> 00:42:38,920
feel the same way.

831
00:42:43,298 --> 00:42:46,135
If you get tired
of waiting for her...

832
00:42:56,496 --> 00:42:58,660
...you know where to find me.

833
00:43:00,406 --> 00:43:02,400
I'll keep that in mind.

834
00:43:08,892 --> 00:43:12,128
So, you're sure Dr. Bashir said
your test results were negative?

835
00:43:12,167 --> 00:43:13,226
That's right.

836
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:14,830
My headache was just a headache.

837
00:43:14,874 --> 00:43:17,004
I never was affected
by Mrs. Troi.

838
00:43:17,046 --> 00:43:18,606
Well, I guess that means
you don't have

839
00:43:18,649 --> 00:43:20,984
a latent attraction
to me, after all.

840
00:43:21,021 --> 00:43:22,889
Nothing latent about it

841
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,626
or weren't you paying
attention last night?

842
00:43:25,666 --> 00:43:27,796
I was paying attention.

843
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:30,606
You still have the touch,
O'Brien.

844
00:43:33,352 --> 00:43:35,687
So do you.

845
00:43:40,134 --> 00:43:42,605
You take good care
of Mommy, honey, okay?

846
00:43:42,641 --> 00:43:44,304
I will.

847
00:43:52,731 --> 00:43:54,634
We'll see you in a few months.

848
00:43:54,669 --> 00:43:56,298
I'll be here.

849
00:44:03,991 --> 00:44:06,589
Chief?
