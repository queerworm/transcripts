1
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:04,337
( door opens )

2
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:07,465
( door closes )

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,886
I didn't expect to find you here.

4
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,180
I thought you'd be down on the Promenade

5
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:17,809
helping Mardah put up the decorations
for the Bajoran Gratitude Festival.

6
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,311
That was the plan

7
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,690
but it turns out I don't have
much to be grateful for.

8
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:28,194
-Isn't that the earring you--
-Bought for Mardah, yeah. You want it?

9
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,197
Maybe you can give it to Major Kira
for her next birthday or something.

10
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:34,242
( sighs ) All right.

11
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:35,869
Tell me about it.

12
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,706
Mardah's gone, Dad.

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,334
She got accepted to the Science Academy
on Regulus III.

14
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:44,836
That's a good school.

15
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,130
It's 300 light-years away.

16
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,174
Jake, you're 16.

17
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,551
Take my word for it, you'll survive.

18
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,345
Sooner or later, you'll find someone else.

19
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:55,680
Who knows?

20
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,641
Maybe you'll find someone tonight
at the Gratitude Festival.

21
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,393
Yeah, sure.

22
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,187
Jake, the whole point of the festival

23
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,523
is to put all your troubles behind you
and make a new start.

24
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,484
I could use one.

25
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,780
-OK, I'll go.
-Good. That's the spirit.

26
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,407
But I'm not going to have any fun.

27
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,576
Oh.

28
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,247
( laughs ) Nervous, Chief?

29
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,625
( laughs )

30
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,001
What are you talking about?

31
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:27,378
That's your fifth cup of coffee
in 20 minutes.

32
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,464
I didn't realize you were keeping track.

33
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,674
Oh, nervous and irascible.

34
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,260
If you hadn't seen your wife
and child for two months,

35
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,428
you'd be irascible, too.

36
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,721
Oh, believe me, I'm looking forward

37
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,431
to Keiko and Molly's visit
as much as you are.

38
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,766
I doubt that.

39
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:43,478
How many games of racquetball
have we played in the last two months?

40
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,897
I don't know. 15, maybe 20.

41
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,398
No, try 70.

42
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,025
I've been keeping track of that, too.

43
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,985
You know what all those games
have proved to me?

44
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,446
That I'm a poor substitute for your wife.

45
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,407
I could have told you that 60 games ago.

46
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:00,453
Thing is, they're only going
to be here for two days.

47
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,247
That's barely enough time to say hello.

48
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,250
And they're back to Bajor again
for another four months.

49
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,502
Four months?

50
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,838
Why, that's another
150 games of racquetball.

51
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,549
I don't think my elbow
can take that kind of abuse.

52
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,759
Maybe you can try
and convince her to stay.

53
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,302
No, no, I can't do that.

54
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,720
I mean, I'm the one who suggested she go

55
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,181
on this agrobiology expedition
in the first place.

56
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:24,102
No, we'll just have to make
the best of the little time we have.

57
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:28,064
Which means we can't waste
a second of the next two days.

58
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:42,120
Ah, <i>peldor joi, </i>Odo.

59
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,956
<i>Peldor joi </i>to you, too, Major.

60
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,333
Well...

61
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,085
It's, uh...

62
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:53,423
It's hard to believe
the Promenade is this empty at midday.

63
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,884
Oh, calm before the storm.

64
00:02:55,967 --> 00:03:00,847
In a few hours, this place will be packed
with Bajorans celebrating the festival.

65
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:06,936
Actually, I was thinking
of joining you this year.

66
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,937
Really?

67
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,564
I don't see why not.

68
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:12,942
None of my Bajoran deputies
work during the Gratitude Festival.

69
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,736
Why should I?

70
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,865
Besides, if I'm going to
live here with you humanoids

71
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:22,785
I may as well immerse myself
in your rituals.

72
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,204
Well, then, we'll see each other later.

73
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,915
I'd like that.

74
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:30,919
If you're not too busy
being the Presider at the festival.

75
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,880
For you, I will make the time, Odo.

76
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,799
Just look for me. I'll be with Bareil.

77
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,801
Oh...

78
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,848
I thought he'd be celebrating
the festival on Bajor.

79
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,725
So did I. I'm glad I was wrong.

80
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,143
He's arriving on the next shuttle.

81
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:51,147
Well... you'd better go.
It'll be here soon.

82
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,066
You're right.

83
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:56,569
-I'll see you at the festival.
-Ah.

84
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,626
Chief.

85
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,461
Major.

86
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,464
-Keiko.
-Ah... Bareil.

87
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,926
-Good luck.
-You, too.

88
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,558
Nerys...`

89
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,644
I am so glad to see you.

90
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,020
I missed you.

91
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,814
I missed you, too.

92
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,780
Miles.

93
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,407
Miles!

94
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,783
Oh, Keiko.

95
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,911
I'm so glad to see you.

96
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,205
I have had the worst trip.

97
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,083
Oh, really? I'm sorry to hear that.

98
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,252
Now that you're here
everything's going to be great.

99
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:56,879
Hello, sweetie.

100
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,007
You ready to have
a great time with your dad?

101
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,133
No.

102
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:01,718
Why not?

103
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,220
I don't feel so good.

104
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,430
Really?

105
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,057
Aw... tell Daddy what's wrong.

106
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,101
-( retching )
-Ah!

107
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,811
( gasps ) Oh...

108
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,355
LWAXANA: Oh... you poor dear.

109
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,817
I should never have given you
all that candy.

110
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,648
I usually make it a point
to drop by Quark's

111
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,317
three or four times a day
at random intervals.

112
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,279
{\an8}Just to let him know
I'm thinking about him

113
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:31,284
{\an8}but seeing today is a holiday
he'll be busier than usual.

114
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,954
{\an8}I suggest you station
a man there full time.

115
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,205
{\an8}I think that about covers it.

116
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,040
{\an8}If you need me, I'll be on the Promenade.

117
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,751
{\an8}LWAXANA: But don't call
unless it's an emergency.

118
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,838
{\an8}The Constable will be occupied.

119
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,716
{\an8}ODO: Madam Ambassador.

120
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:51,095
{\an8}Oh, do we have to be so formal?

121
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:59,353
{\an8}Didn't they teach you any manners
in Starfleet Academy?

122
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,898
{\an8}Be a dear, run along.

123
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,859
{\an8}The Constable and I have
a lot of catching up to do.

124
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,736
{\an8}Uh, come back in five minutes.

125
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,738
{\an8}Make that half an hour.

126
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,493
{\an8}So...

127
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,454
{\an8}what brings you to the station?

128
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,164
Well, officially I'm here

129
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,501
as the Betazoid representative
to the Gratitude Festival

130
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:27,673
but the truth is, I came to see you,
you poor, sweet, tortured man.

131
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,759
Excuse me?

132
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:33,012
Oh, well, I know the torment
you must be going through.

133
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,723
Well, to spend your whole life searching
for your people,

134
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:40,061
only to discover that they're the leaders
of that awful Dominion.

135
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,230
You heard about that.

136
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,564
Odo...

137
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,358
don't worry.

138
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,610
I'm here to help you.

139
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,696
What kind of help do you mean?

140
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:54,158
Oh, a sympathetic ear...

141
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,494
a shoulder to cry on...

142
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,412
a lap to melt in.

143
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,164
Ah.

144
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,377
Well, that's very considerate of you,
but unnecessary.

145
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,754
My people are who they are.

146
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:07,880
I am who I am.

147
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,465
I've learned to accept that.

148
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,635
Oh, you brave soul.

149
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:19,183
Oh, why don't we go someplace quiet
and you can tell me all about it?

150
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,603
Actually, I was planning
to attend the opening

151
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,647
of the Gratitude Festival this afternoon.

152
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,315
Oh...

153
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,234
Well, even better.

154
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,487
First, a little fun and relaxation

155
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:36,534
and then we can delve
into the depths of your pain.

156
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:40,037
I'll freshen up and meet you
in front of the Bajoran Temple

157
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,582
for the Presider's opening address.

158
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:49,505
I promise you, Odo,
you'll never be alone again.

159
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,807
( beep )

160
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,855
Level 23, Section 8.

161
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,481
Oh!

162
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,405
We need to see each other more often.

163
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:17,867
Hmm, I wish we both weren't so busy.

164
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:27,209
I never expected Kai Winn to make me
one of her principal advisors.

165
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,086
I think she asks your advice

166
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,882
just so that she can do the exact opposite
of what you recommend.

167
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:37,428
I know you don't like Winn
but the office has changed her.

168
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,889
The Prophets chose well.

169
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:46,854
So, why don't we leave
spiritual matters in their capable hands

170
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:50,941
and uh, concentrate on enjoying ourselves?

171
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,401
I have to go.

172
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,781
The festival doesn't start
for an hour.

173
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:00,076
But I have to set up the Renewal Scrolls
along the Promenade

174
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,160
but it won't take long.

175
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,370
Jadzia's promised to help me.

176
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,205
Hmm. Jadzia, of course.

177
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:05,831
I've never understood

178
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,250
how the two of you
could be such good friends.

179
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,169
She's so...

180
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,505
Unpredictable.

181
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:13,923
And you're so...

182
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,299
Predictable?

183
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,093
I didn't mean it like that.

184
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,805
It's just that she gets to spend
so much more time with you than I do.

185
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:25,601
Jadzia and I have been doing this
for the past two years.

186
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,603
It's becoming a tradition.

187
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:31,440
I was hoping we could start
a few traditions of our own.

188
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,318
We will... later tonight.

189
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,665
( sighs )

190
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,088
( exhausted sigh )

191
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,757
Is she asleep?

192
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:00,261
It looks like the medicine
Doctor Bashir prescribed is working.

193
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,346
Ooh, that's a relief.

194
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,266
( sighs )

195
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,309
Rough trip?

196
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,645
Oh, it was a disaster.

197
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,648
I thought it would never end.

198
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,733
Well...

199
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,446
I'm glad you're home.

200
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,072
Me, too.

201
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,783
We should get ready for the festival.

202
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,243
The baby-sitter will be here any minute.

203
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,328
Oh, the festival.

204
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,248
On the other hand...

205
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:34,170
We could spend the rest of the day
locked away in our quarters.

206
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,799
Miles, what I really want to do is sleep.

207
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,178
Well... then maybe you should.

208
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,054
Miles, I didn't say I was going to.

209
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,848
I just meant I could use some.

210
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,391
That's OK.

211
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,852
If you need to sleep, go ahead.

212
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,937
-I'll understand.
-No, you won't.

213
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,147
You'll be disappointed

214
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,484
and you'll start brooding
and stomping around like an Andorian bull.

215
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,570
Look, go or stay, sleep or don't.

216
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:00,905
It's all the same to me.

217
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,324
Just tell me what you want to do,
and we'll do it.

218
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:06,076
Miles, I've been making decisions
all day long.

219
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,203
You decide.

220
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,080
OK.

221
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,875
We'll go to the festival

222
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,752
but we don't have to go right away.

223
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:18,214
I mean, you can take time to relax
and then change into something nice.

224
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:19,924
Nice?

225
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:21,759
Yeah.

226
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,719
Like your red dress.

227
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,847
My red dress? Really?

228
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,767
Is there something wrong
with your red dress?

229
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:33,979
No. It's, it's...
Just a little tight, that's all.

230
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,149
Oh. That's why I like it.

231
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,946
All right. If it'll make you happy,
I'll wear the red dress.

232
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,658
Look, forget the red dress, OK?
Just wear whatever you want.

233
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,034
Look...

234
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:50,746
Let's just try to enjoy the next two days.

235
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:55,376
I'll change into something nice
and we'll go to the festival, OK?

236
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,461
Fine.

237
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,588
( door opens, closes )

238
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,424
( sighs ) I can hardly wait.

239
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,474
( indistinct conversations )

240
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,440
( ringing continues )

241
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:42,882
( speaking native language )

242
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,436
( applause )

243
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:03,235
And now I have the honor

244
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:07,948
of placing the first
Renewal Scroll into the fire.

245
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,287
As the scrolls burn

246
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,082
may our troubles turn to ashes with them.

247
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,257
( cheering )

248
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,263
And now, for the next 26 hours

249
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,850
I expect you all to enjoy yourselves.

250
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,852
I know I will.

251
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,190
May the Prophets walk with us.

252
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,158
( woodwinds playing )

253
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,626
( groaning )

254
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,795
Jake, are you all right?

255
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,297
Uh, just felt funny there for a second.

256
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,549
You're sure you're all right?

257
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,802
Yeah, Dad.

258
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,639
Never felt better.

259
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,737
Bareil? What are you looking for?

260
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,281
Hmm? Oh, nothing.

261
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,784
Just... just looking.

262
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,035
Hmm.

263
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,787
<i>Peldor joi.</i>

264
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,540
Oh, Jake, how thoughtful. Thank you.

265
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,543
Uh, I know you're busy
but can I talk to you for a second?

266
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,752
Sure.

267
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,338
In private. It's kind of personal.

268
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,923
Oh, um...

269
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,717
I'll be right back.

270
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,929
Now, Jake, what can I do for you?

271
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,514
Uh...

272
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,100
I need some advice.

273
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,562
You see, there's this older woman
and I think we're perfect for each other.

274
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,064
Ah... and she doesn't.

275
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,025
I don't know what she thinks.

276
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,987
Well, Jake, my advice to you
is to tell Mardah how you feel.

277
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,489
-That way you'll know--
-Mardah and I broke up.

278
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,159
You broke up?

279
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,368
Well, then, who?

280
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,162
You.

281
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,748
Me?

282
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,459
I love you, Nerys.

283
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,046
Want to go out with me?

284
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,303
Morn, it's hard to believe

285
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,973
a handsome, fun-loving guy like you
could have so many problems.

286
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,725
My advice to you is to burn this

287
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,728
as quickly as possible
and don't look back.

288
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,153
Sage advice.

289
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,322
Vedek Bareil. It's good to see you.

290
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:57,242
Oh, you have such a wise, generous spirit.

291
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,496
I only wish I had a friend like you.

292
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,706
I think of you as a friend.

293
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,083
You mean that?

294
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,876
Of course.

295
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:10,005
Oh, I'm glad because I was hoping

296
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,258
that you and I could get
to know each other a little better.

297
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,891
A lot better.

298
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,521
Excuse me.

299
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,608
( music playing )

300
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,840
I love Bajoran music.

301
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,926
It's so intelligent, so vital...

302
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,971
It reminds me of you.

303
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,765
Oh, dance with me, Odo.

304
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,226
I'm sorry. I don't dance.

305
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,644
Nonsense.

306
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,980
I saw you moving to the music.

307
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,982
That wasn't dancing.

308
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,650
That was... swaying.

309
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,776
Oh...

310
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,820
then sway with me, Odo.

311
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,114
Sway with me.

312
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:21,660
I just remembered. I'm needed in Security.

313
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,745
( sighs )

314
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,706
I'll come with you.

315
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,959
Ah, hello, Lieutenant.

316
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,461
-Having a good time?
-No.

317
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,130
( grunts in agreement )

318
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,762
That's right.

319
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:44,892
Genuine latinum-plated
Renewal Scroll inscription pens

320
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:49,146
blessed by Vedek Redab himself
shortly before he passed away.

321
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,023
Each pen is engraved with the words

322
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:54,526
"Deep Space 9's Third Annual
Gratitude Festival,"

323
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:59,072
today's date, and a lovely portrait
of the station by Ermat Zimm.

324
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,283
So, get them while you can!

325
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,077
They're sure to become collectors' items.

326
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,330
( indistinct conversations )

327
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,338
Oh!

328
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:22,930
So...

329
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:27,142
What do you say we take a walk
around the Promenade for a while?

330
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,144
I'd rather stay here.

331
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:33,232
I-I never thought I'd say this
but I kind of miss Quark's.

332
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,693
The noise, the excitement...

333
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:37,819
our table.

334
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,865
You know...

335
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,951
I haven't sat here since you've been gone.

336
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,746
Oh, that's so sweet.

337
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,916
So, how's the survey been going?

338
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,670
Uh... the terrain's
rougher than we expected

339
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,673
and the ecosystem's a lot more diverse

340
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,800
than it looked from the orbital scans.

341
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:02,219
All in all, it's been pretty grueling.

342
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,595
Really?

343
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,932
Don't get me wrong.
I'm having a wonderful time.

344
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,059
That's good.

345
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:12,938
There is one problem
I have to talk to you about.

346
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:16,483
It looks like the project's
taking longer than we hoped.

347
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,569
What do you mean, "longer"?

348
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,030
You have to understand, Miles,

349
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,993
every valley has
an entirely different ecosystem.

350
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,703
There's a lot of work to be done.

351
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,622
But how much longer is it going to take?

352
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,916
I'm... I'm not sure.

353
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,793
Try a guess.

354
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:38,088
Uh, you know, an extra couple of days?
A week? Two?

355
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,757
More like two or three months.

356
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,301
You're telling me

357
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,262
you're going to be on Bajor
for another seven months?

358
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,807
It's either that or ask them
to find another botanist.

359
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,268
Maybe that's something worth considering.

360
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,771
-Are you asking me to resign?
-No...

361
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,441
but seven more months?

362
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,943
I don't like this any more than you do.

363
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,862
You just said you were
having a great time.

364
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,447
Oh, I'm sorry.

365
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,658
I suppose you'd be happier
if I were miserable?

366
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,243
I didn't say that.

367
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:15,083
( sighing ) Sebarr was right.
I never should've mentioned it.

368
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,419
Who's Sebarr?

369
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,588
He's one of the zoologists
I'm working with.

370
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:23,467
He warned me not to talk to you about this
until after the Gratitude Festival.

371
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,594
And who's he to be giving you advice?

372
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,555
He's a friend.

373
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,973
A friend?

374
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,684
I thought you were down there working.

375
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,603
We are working.

376
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:38,440
Yeah, with time out for intimate
little chats about our relationship?

377
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,984
What else did you tell him about us?

378
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,864
Miles, you're behaving like a child.

379
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,574
What do you want me to say?

380
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:51,286
I want you to say
that you're not going back...

381
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,997
that you're going to stay here with me.

382
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:59,961
Miles, right now I don't even want
to sit at the same table with you.

383
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,464
Fine.

384
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,966
Well, go on.
Leave.

385
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,970
Go back to Bajor and your plants
and Sebarr.

386
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,307
See if I care!

387
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,877
Whoa!
Slow down.

388
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,171
Hi, Dad.

389
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,257
I've been looking all over for you.

390
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,383
In case you've forgotten,

391
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,510
we're hosting a Gratitude Dinner
tonight in the Wardroom.

392
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,428
I could use your help in getting ready.

393
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,764
I'm kind of busy right now, Dad.
I-I have to find someone.

394
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,141
Oh, Major Kira?

395
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,226
-How'd you know?
-I just spoke to her.

396
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,603
-Really? Where is she?
-Ah, just hold on!

397
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,230
But I have to talk to her.

398
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,816
You know, you were right about me
meeting someone at the festival.

399
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,152
I did not mean Major Kira.

400
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,696
-You like her, don't you?
-Well, of course I like her.

401
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:08,864
Well, so do I.

402
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:13,535
( sighs ) Jake,
what you're feeling now is just a crush.

403
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,371
Look, Jake...

404
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,459
Right now,

405
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:24,296
you are confused, vulnerable, hurt.

406
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,380
You miss Mardah.

407
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:26,798
Mardah was a mistake.

408
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,259
She was too young, too immature for me.

409
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,011
Major Kira is a woman.

410
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:33,346
Major Kira is in love with Vedek Bareil.

411
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,640
It won't last. He's always on Bajor.

412
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,977
She needs someone who can
be with her all the time, like me.

413
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,981
( sighs ) Jake,
I don't want to see you hurt again.

414
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,983
I appreciate that.

415
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,069
But this is between Nerys and me.

416
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,990
Don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.

417
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,450
Thanks.

418
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,455
I really can't accept this.

419
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,207
But I want you to have it.
It's my gift to you.

420
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,835
Well, that's very thoughtful of you
but I have nothing to give you in return.

421
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,880
Being with you is the only present I need.

422
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,132
Now, come on.

423
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,384
Let's go write our Renewal Scrolls.

424
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,068
<i>Peldor joi, </i>Chief.

425
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,028
You look terrible.

426
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,447
It's just a little headache, that's all.

427
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,367
Here. Have a free pen.

428
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,203
What for?

429
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:41,039
To write down your problems
on a Renewal Scroll.

430
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,375
There isn't a scroll long enough
for all my problems.

431
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:47,337
Really? I thought you could sum them up
with one word...

432
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,838
Keiko.

433
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,299
Tell me I'm wrong.

434
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,678
If you ask me, it's your own fault.

435
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:57,389
You never should have let her
go to Bajor in the first place.

436
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,975
What was I supposed to do?
Force her to stay here with me?

437
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,102
That would have been a good start.

438
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,604
You hu-mans, you never learn.

439
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:09,401
You let your women go out in public,
hold jobs,

440
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,652
wear clothing,

441
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,071
and you wonder why your
marriages fall apart.

442
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,073
That's your solution, Quark, huh?

443
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,117
Treat women like property?

444
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,785
Criticize it all you want,

445
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:23,248
but on the Ferengi homeworld
husbands and wives never argue.

446
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:26,876
There's no divorce, no broken homes...

447
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,172
Nothing but peaceful conjugal bliss.

448
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:36,011
If Ferengi marriages are so wonderful
why are you still single?

449
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,514
I haven't met the right woman yet.

450
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,017
Well, I have.

451
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,186
She just walked out that door.

452
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,605
And out of your life.

453
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,651
Not if I can help it.

454
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,166
Bareil!

455
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,710
I was wondering where you disappeared to.

456
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:12,589
Come on, you can do better than that.

457
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,883
Someone might see us.

458
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,761
We are the only people here.

459
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,930
Everyone else is on the Promenade.

460
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:29,356
We have two hours before we're supposed
to join Commander Sisko for dinner.

461
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,276
That gives us some time
to be alone together.

462
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,904
I... I can't. Um...

463
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:37,781
Why not?

464
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,699
I have to find Jadzia.

465
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,993
Jadzia? Is there something wrong?

466
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,536
No, not at all.

467
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,205
Do you know where she is?

468
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,958
She's probably on the Promenade.

469
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,378
She wasn't there the last time I looked.

470
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:54,297
Why is it so important
for you to see Jadzia?

471
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,300
I'll explain everything later.

472
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,636
Uh...

473
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,347
Thank you, Nerys.

474
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:03,807
For what?

475
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,059
For being such a good friend.

476
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,107
Friend?

477
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:16,861
Dax...

478
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,196
what are you doing here?

479
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,990
I thought you might need some help
getting ready for the party.

480
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,993
Thanks, but that won't be necessary.

481
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,663
Wouldn't you rather be celebrating
on the Promenade?

482
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:29,999
No, thanks. I don't want to run
into Vedek Bareil.

483
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:33,044
Oh, is there a problem between you?

484
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,338
He can't keep his hands off me.

485
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,591
That doesn't sound like Vedek Bareil.

486
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:39,968
I couldn't believe it myself

487
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,095
but he wouldn't leave me alone.

488
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:45,140
He's probably still out there
looking for me.

489
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,267
Have you told Kira?

490
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,436
I don't know how.

491
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,521
It's going to break her heart.

492
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:54,524
( sighs ) Someone has to tell her.

493
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,987
Do you want me to do it?

494
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,196
Would you?

495
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,451
Well...

496
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,079
if you think that's the
best way to handle it.

497
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,539
( sighs )

498
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,499
I'd really appreciate it, Benjamin.

499
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,835
I mean, this whole thing is ridiculous.

500
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,671
How could I be interested in Bareil?

501
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,008
We both know...

502
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,093
It's always been you.

503
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,267
( stammering )

504
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,025
Dax...

505
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,401
Hmm?

506
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:42,155
-What are you doing?
-Making myself comfortable.

507
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,911
Have I ever told you
that you smell wonderful?

508
00:29:54,918 --> 00:30:00,590
Ah, you know, old man, I have to admit
you had me going there for a minute.

509
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:07,514
Benjamin, stop acting so coy.
There's no one around.

510
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,808
I have an idea.

511
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:14,729
You cancel the party, and then, that way
we can spend the evening alone together.

512
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,941
-What do you say?
-Oh... uh...

513
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,693
-Sisko to Bashir.
-BASHIR: <i>Go ahead, Commander.</i>

514
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,530
Meet me in the Infirmary immediately.

515
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:24,572
<i>Aye, sir.</i>

516
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,116
BASHIR: Her vital signs are normal.

517
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,118
Her brain activity is normal.

518
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:32,831
No sign of infection or intoxication
of any kind.

519
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,916
She's the picture of health.

520
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,209
DAX: Told you.

521
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,336
Then why did you put
your head on my chest?

522
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,255
Oh, Julian, you should have seen his face.

523
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,007
Admit it, you were
this far away from total panic.

524
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,510
BASHIR: I think we've both been
victims of a practical joke.

525
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,971
At least someone around here
has a sense of humor.

526
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,433
Um, see you at the party, Julian.

527
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,070
I've never been so embarrassed
in all my life,

528
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,738
making me go through all those tests.

529
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,907
It's your fault, Dax.
You took this one too far.

530
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:11,411
Oh, if I didn't love you so much
I'd be angry with you.

531
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,829
See you at the party.

532
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,177
( sighs )

533
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,598
You look like you could use
a little cheering up.

534
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,017
-Jake, do me a favor.
-Anything.

535
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,226
Leave me alone.

536
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,644
Uh...

537
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,104
( sighs )

538
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:47,071
( door opens )

539
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,247
-Hi, sweetie.
-Hi.

540
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,458
-Feeling better?
-Lots better.

541
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,627
Ah, that's what I wanted to hear.

542
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,086
( snorting )

543
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:06,257
-Where's Mommy?
-In her room, sad.

544
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,677
Oh. Well, listen,
why don't you go and play with Piggy

545
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,262
in your room for a while

546
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:14,223
and we'll see if Daddy
can cheer Mommy up, huh?

547
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,281
Keiko, it's me.
Can I come in?

548
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,158
Not now, Miles.

549
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:39,040
You're right.
I'm an idiot... sometimes.

550
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,458
If I don't get my own way

551
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:43,753
I can be selfish
and childish and pigheaded.

552
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:48,049
I said some things to you
that were pretty stupid.

553
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,593
I wish I could take them back.

554
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,561
But even if it's too late for that, I...

555
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:04,148
There's one thing
I want you to know, Keiko...

556
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,858
I... I love you.

557
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,153
I always have and I always will.

558
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,575
I want you to know
I've left a letter of resignation

559
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,786
on Commander Sisko's desk.

560
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:19,914
I'm ready to move down to Bajor
with you tomorrow

561
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,416
if you'll have me.

562
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,584
And after that,
if you want to move back to Earth

563
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,294
that's OK, too.

564
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,338
I'll do whatever it takes.

565
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,384
I just don't want to lose you.

566
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:37,265
Honey, did you hear what I said?

567
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,225
Yes.

568
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,727
And?

569
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,604
And I need time to think.

570
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,649
Why don't you go
to Commander Sisko's party?

571
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,860
We can talk when you get back.

572
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,781
If that's what you want.

573
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,871
-Major...
-Ah!

574
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:02,206
Aren't you headed in the wrong direction?

575
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,918
-Commander Sisko's party?
-Oh, I'm not going.

576
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,921
-Why ever not?
-Because Bareil will be there.

577
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,632
I thought the two of you
were very happy together.

578
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,844
So did I, but it turns out
he'd rather be with Dax than me.

579
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,680
And to make matters worse,
I have Jake Sisko chasing me

580
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:20,224
around the station
professing his undying love.

581
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,350
BASHIR: Well, that's strange.

582
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,479
A little while ago
Jadzia had Commander Sisko convinced

583
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,605
that she was in love with him.

584
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:28,066
He even had me examine her
to make sure she was all right.

585
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,026
Apparently, it was only a joke.

586
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:31,694
Well, are you sure?

587
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,988
People are acting very strangely today.

588
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:38,159
Maybe I should take another look
at Jadzia's test results.

589
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,243
Excuse me.

590
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:42,622
Constable, would you tell Commander Sisko
that I'll be a little late?

591
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:51,839
Oh, I should be getting to the Infirmary.

592
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,299
I'll join you.

593
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:57,470
( groans ) Maybe you should examine
Bareil and Jake while you're at it.

594
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,347
That wouldn't be a bad idea.

595
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,769
Oh, this won't take long.

596
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,159
Oh, what is it, Odo?

597
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:23,037
I may not be able to read your emotions
but I can read your expression.

598
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,872
-Something's wrong.
-I'm fine.

599
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,708
I wish you'd tell me what's bothering you.
Maybe it would help you.

600
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,670
As soon as something bothers me
I'll let you know, I promise.

601
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,505
Why do I find stubborn men so attractive?

602
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,298
( groans )

603
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,008
( sighs )

604
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,511
Would you please stop following me?

605
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:41,556
Oh, gladly,
if you'll just stop running away.

606
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:46,519
I-I-I have something very important
to talk to you about.

607
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:49,605
Discuss it with Major Kira.
I'm not interested.

608
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,776
But, Dad,
you promised that Nerys would be here!

609
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,945
She will, and stop calling her Nerys.

610
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,572
( gasps )

611
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,198
<i>Peldor joi.</i>

612
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,868
Oh, Commander, I didn't realize

613
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,786
that you and Lieutenant Dax
were that close.

614
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,829
We're not.

615
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,747
Sisko to Bashir.

616
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,334
Computer, locate Dr. Bashir.

617
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,504
COMPUTER: <i>Dr. Bashir is in the Infirmary.</i>

618
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:18,551
( sighs ) Constable, go get Dr. Bashir
and bring him here immediately.

619
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,428
I'll be right back.

620
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,762
I'll go with you.

621
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,931
Yes, of course you will.

622
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,020
I wonder what Commander Sisko wanted.

623
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,605
Oh, it can wait.

624
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,984
This is very embarrassing.

625
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,195
Yes, we have to stop.

626
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,197
Definitely.

627
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,659
Doctor!

628
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:49,790
Commander Sisko needs to see you
in the Wardroom.

629
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,834
Oh, tell him...

630
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,836
Oh, tell him I'll be there shortly.

631
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,004
Now, Doctor!

632
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,631
You'd better go.

633
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,132
( moans amorously )

634
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,009
Right.

635
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,640
<i>Peldor joi.</i>

636
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,146
Please, Commander, step aside.

637
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:15,107
I need to speak to Jadzia.

638
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,193
I don't think she wants to speak with you.

639
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,694
DAX: You tell him, Benjamin.

640
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:21,572
I... I only want to give her this.

641
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:24,075
A Bajoran betrothal bracelet?

642
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,494
It's been in my family for generations.

643
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,703
Can I see that?

644
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,290
I...

645
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:34,377
Nerys! Am I glad to see you.

646
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,128
Doctor... I need your help!

647
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,214
And I need yours, too.

648
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,007
You've got to get me away from Kira.

649
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,176
I can't... ( gasps )
keep my hands off of her.

650
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,720
What's worse
I can't keep my hands off him.

651
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,931
( door opens )

652
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:50,184
( sighs )

653
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,438
I can't explain it either.

654
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,692
( gasps )

655
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,990
( sighs )

656
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,747
( <i>sighs </i>)

657
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,582
She doesn't love me.

658
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,376
Who?

659
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,253
Nerys.

660
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,090
( <i>sighs </i>)

661
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,842
You're better off.

662
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,928
In the end, they only break your heart.

663
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,638
( door opens )

664
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,434
Although, sometimes it's worth it.

665
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,112
What do you think?

666
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,448
You look beautiful.

667
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:50,077
Did you really mean it
about turning in your resignation?

668
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,120
Mm-hmm.

669
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:56,083
Well, you'd better get it back
before Commander Sisko sees it.

670
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,420
It was very nice of you to offer.

671
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,222
I love you so much.

672
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,772
( laughing ) Hey!

673
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:19,940
( lasciviously ) Oh...

674
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,527
Ooh...

675
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,614
Commander, here's that
I'danian spice pudding you ordered.

676
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,408
I want to give this to you
as a token of my affection.

677
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:30,951
Oh, no, you don't!

678
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,704
Bareil, listen to me...

679
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,831
I'll fight for her if I have to!

680
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,542
( grunts )

681
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,840
Oh, I'm sorry, Benjamin.

682
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:47,218
He was just starting to annoy me.

683
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,302
QUARK: Commander...

684
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,597
You throw one hell of a party.

685
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:55,351
Pudding, anyone?
I've got I'danian spice pudding.

686
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:56,769
( Bareil groans )

687
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,230
Are you all right?

688
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,273
( groans )

689
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,859
Pudding, anyone?

690
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,237
Doctor?

691
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,906
-Pudding, anyone?
-No, no, thank you.

692
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,074
Ooh!

693
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,076
( groans )

694
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,460
I'll take one.

695
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,712
Help yourself.

696
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,550
Why did she hit me?

697
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,677
( gasps )

698
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,054
Oh, forget about him.

699
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:35,433
What about me? I need you, Keiko.

700
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,352
My ears tingle at the sight of you.

701
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,854
Marry me.

702
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,647
She's taken, Quark!

703
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,232
( squealing )

704
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:44,900
Easy, Chief.

705
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,861
He doesn't know what he's doing.

706
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,199
What are you looking at me for?

707
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:56,203
Zanthi fever?
Oh, that's ridiculous.

708
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,830
That, that's impossible.

709
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,623
That only affects older Betazoids.

710
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,750
Well, that may be,
but according to my tests

711
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,627
you show all the symptoms.

712
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:07,006
Zanthi fever is a virus
which affects the empathic abilities of...

713
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:09,592
um... mature Betazoids.

714
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:12,303
It causes them to project
their emotions onto others.

715
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:16,891
Then Mrs. Troi's amorous feelings
for... someone on the station

716
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,809
were being passed along
to the people around her?

717
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:19,894
Well, not everyone.

718
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,521
Only those within close proximity to her
when she had an attack,

719
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,064
and even then
there would have had to have been

720
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,442
some preexisting latent attraction.

721
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,863
-You're saying Dax...
-Only on a subconscious level.

722
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,491
Best not think about it too much,
if you ask me.

723
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,410
I am terribly sorry, Commander.

724
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,704
I hope I haven't caused too much trouble.

725
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:41,874
I'm sure no permanent harm
was done, right, Doctor?

726
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:44,835
Oh, a simple wide-spectrum antiviral agent
should cure Mrs. Troi.

727
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,045
And as for everyone else

728
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,546
well, they'll be back to normal
in a day or two.

729
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,714
Excuse me.

730
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,134
I promised Nerys that I'd meet her
in her quarters this evening.

731
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:57,139
I think you ought to postpone that visit
for a day or two.

732
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,391
( sigh )

733
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:03,062
SISKO: <i>Commander's Log, supplemental.</i>

734
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:05,523
<i>I'm happy to report </i>
<i>that Dr. Bashir's diagnosis</i>

735
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,191
<i>has been proven correct.</i>

736
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:10,569
<i>My son and all the others affected</i>
<i>by Mrs. Troi's condition </i>

737
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,738
<i>have made full recoveries.</i>

738
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:13,989
( Troi laughing )

739
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:17,826
This is one Gratitude Festival
they'll be talking about for a long time.

740
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,745
I know I'll never forget it.

741
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:23,832
I hope everything
works out for you, Odo...

742
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,459
with Major Kira.

743
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,503
I... don't know what you mean.

744
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:31,006
Oh, don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.

745
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,551
After all, I know what it's like

746
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:38,138
to be attracted to someone who doesn't
necessarily feel the same way.

747
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,394
( sighs )

748
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:46,021
If you get tired of waiting for her...

749
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:58,367
...you know where to find me.

750
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,079
I'll keep that in mind.

751
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:12,715
So, you're sure Dr. Bashir said
your test results were negative?

752
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:15,175
That's right.
My headache was just a headache.

753
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,261
I never was affected by Mrs. Troi.

754
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:22,016
Well, I guess that means you don't have
a latent attraction to me, after all.

755
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,809
Nothing latent about it

756
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,644
or weren't you paying
attention last night?

757
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,563
I was paying attention.

758
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,524
You still have the touch, O'Brien.

759
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,529
So do you.

760
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,661
You take good care of Mommy, honey, OK?

761
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,455
I will.

762
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,632
We'll see you in a few months.

763
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,091
I'll be here.

764
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,893
Chief?

765
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:10,689
( both laughing )
