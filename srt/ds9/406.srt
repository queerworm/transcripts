1
00:00:12,658 --> 00:00:14,093
It's a trick.

2
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:17,069
Of course, it's a trick,
but how did she do it?

3
00:00:17,102 --> 00:00:20,338
She probably beamed the egg
directly into her mouth

4
00:00:20,378 --> 00:00:22,612
from one of the transporters.

5
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,678
Actually,
one of my previous hosts

6
00:00:24,722 --> 00:00:27,024
used to dabble
in the sleight of hand.

7
00:00:27,062 --> 00:00:28,053
Was it Tobin?

8
00:00:28,098 --> 00:00:29,067
That's right.

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,071
Ah, he sounds like
the right type...

10
00:00:31,106 --> 00:00:34,410
painfully shy, introverted,
a slight lack of confidence...

11
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:37,012
just the kind of person
who might want to dazzle

12
00:00:37,054 --> 00:00:38,991
the world with his
magical abilities.

13
00:00:39,026 --> 00:00:41,624
She swallowed the egg
before she came into the bar

14
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,365
and then
regurgitated it on cue.

15
00:00:43,404 --> 00:00:45,876
Quite disgusting, actually.

16
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,778
Wrong again.

17
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:49,011
Sisko to Dax.

18
00:00:49,052 --> 00:00:51,388
I'd like to see you
in my office, Commander.

19
00:00:51,425 --> 00:00:53,020
On my way, Benjamin.

20
00:00:53,063 --> 00:00:54,430
Don't worry, Quark.

21
00:00:54,466 --> 00:00:56,494
You'll figure it out eventually.

22
00:00:56,538 --> 00:00:58,030
What?

23
00:00:58,076 --> 00:01:01,073
No wonder
you can't figure it out.

24
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:03,110
Your head's full of latinum.

25
00:01:04,124 --> 00:01:08,831
Ladies and gentlemen,
the amazing Jadzia Dax.

26
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:29,254
Have a seat.

27
00:01:30,827 --> 00:01:33,299
A Trill science team
is coming to the station

28
00:01:33,334 --> 00:01:36,240
to conduct field tests
on experimental techniques

29
00:01:36,275 --> 00:01:38,143
for creating
artificial wormholes.

30
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,342
It sounds interesting.

31
00:01:39,383 --> 00:01:43,189
It's an important project,
and I've agreed to let them use

32
00:01:43,226 --> 00:01:45,163
the <i>Defiant</i>
for their experiments.

33
00:01:45,198 --> 00:01:47,362
But I thought you
would want to know

34
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:50,468
that the leader
of the science team

35
00:01:50,512 --> 00:01:52,142
is Dr. Lenara Kahn.

36
00:01:56,694 --> 00:01:58,289
Lenara Kahn.

37
00:01:58,332 --> 00:02:00,098
That's right.

38
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:03,009
Look, you've got
about three months

39
00:02:03,045 --> 00:02:04,480
of leave accumulated.

40
00:02:04,515 --> 00:02:06,714
Why don't you take some of it?

41
00:02:06,753 --> 00:02:09,351
We can afford to do without you
for a while.

42
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:13,870
Am I that dispensable
around here?

43
00:02:13,906 --> 00:02:16,208
We'll never notice you're gone.

44
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,388
No.

45
00:02:22,495 --> 00:02:23,394
I'll stay.

46
00:02:23,497 --> 00:02:25,400
I can handle it.

47
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:26,597
You're sure.

48
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,165
I'm sure.

49
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:31,343
I've never let my past lives
interfere with my job

50
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:33,584
and I'm not going to start now.

51
00:02:33,623 --> 00:02:34,592
I'll be fine.

52
00:02:34,626 --> 00:02:36,620
Okay.

53
00:02:41,845 --> 00:02:43,611
But...

54
00:02:43,649 --> 00:02:46,178
thank you
for giving me the option.

55
00:02:46,223 --> 00:02:48,422
Anytime, old man.

56
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:09,713
I'm Dr. Hanor Pren
of the Trill Science Ministry.

57
00:03:09,751 --> 00:03:11,220
I'm Major Kira Nerys

58
00:03:11,255 --> 00:03:13,955
and I'd like to welcome you
to Deep Space 9.

59
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:17,401
This is our Strategic Operations
Officer, Commander Worf

60
00:03:17,437 --> 00:03:20,205
and this is our Science Officer,
Commander Dax.

61
00:03:20,245 --> 00:03:23,982
Allow me to introduce you
to our team leader

62
00:03:24,021 --> 00:03:30,197
Dr. Lenara Kahn and her brother,
Dr. Bejal Otner.

63
00:03:30,237 --> 00:03:31,501
Major Kira

64
00:03:31,574 --> 00:03:32,975
Commander Worf

65
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:34,743
and Commander Dax.

66
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:43,629
It's been a long time.

67
00:03:43,672 --> 00:03:45,666
Yes, it has.

68
00:03:45,711 --> 00:03:48,047
If you will come with me,
I will show you

69
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,179
to your quarters.

70
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,597
You know that woman.

71
00:03:59,012 --> 00:04:01,211
I know her.

72
00:04:01,251 --> 00:04:03,553
She used to be my wife.

73
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:07,273
So let me get this straight.

74
00:06:07,313 --> 00:06:10,914
Dax's first host
was named Lela, right?

75
00:06:10,956 --> 00:06:11,925
I think so.

76
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,430
Lela Dax.
That's right.

77
00:06:14,465 --> 00:06:15,798
Then Lela dies

78
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:19,834
and the Dax symbiont goes on
to a man named Tobin

79
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,548
and after Tobin dies,
then it's on to Emony

80
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:26,027
then Torias, Audrid...

81
00:06:26,062 --> 00:06:28,398
No, no. Audrid, then Torias.

82
00:06:28,435 --> 00:06:29,927
Sorry.

83
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:35,282
Audrid, Torias, Joran, Curzon
and then eventually, Jadzia.

84
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,758
Right.

85
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:43,033
And this, uh, Dr. Lenara Kahn
person was once married to?

86
00:06:43,073 --> 00:06:45,911
Torias, but, of course, in
those days, she wasn't Lenara.

87
00:06:45,946 --> 00:06:47,472
I knew
it couldn't be that simple.

88
00:06:47,517 --> 00:06:49,989
And the Kahn symbiont,
which is now joined to Lenara

89
00:06:50,024 --> 00:06:52,292
used to be joined
to a woman named Nilani.

90
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,700
And it was Nilani
who married Torias Dax.

91
00:06:54,737 --> 00:06:57,266
But Torias was killed
in a shuttle accident.

92
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,940
And Nilani became a widow.

93
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,381
Years later, when Nilani died

94
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:02,355
the Kahn symbiont
was joined to Lenara.

95
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:07,996
And now, Nilani is Lenara,
and Torias is Jadzia.

96
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:11,810
So that makes Lenara
Jadzia's ex-wife.

97
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:15,015
It's a little more complicated
than that, Quark.

98
00:07:15,056 --> 00:07:16,457
I'm sure it is,
but to be honest,

99
00:07:16,492 --> 00:07:18,156
I'm sorry I brought
the whole thing up.

100
00:07:18,264 --> 00:07:19,894
It's giving me a headache.

101
00:07:19,935 --> 00:07:21,803
It must be all the latinum

102
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,674
rattling around in there.

103
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,457
Oh.

104
00:07:29,493 --> 00:07:30,655
I thought so.

105
00:07:30,696 --> 00:07:32,792
You really should
have that looked at.

106
00:07:36,644 --> 00:07:38,581
Get back to work!

107
00:07:38,617 --> 00:07:41,419
If you'll excuse me...

108
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:48,337
Dax teach you that?

109
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,779
Next time, I'm going to pull
a rabbit out of his ear.

110
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:55,594
The one thing
I don't understand

111
00:07:55,628 --> 00:07:58,123
is why Dax and Lenara
can't just pick up

112
00:07:58,168 --> 00:07:59,728
where they left off...

113
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:03,143
I mean, if they're still
in love with each other.

114
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:04,741
Ah, now there's the rub.

115
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,154
Even if they do harbor
feelings for each other

116
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:09,959
it's strictly against
the rules of Trill society

117
00:08:09,998 --> 00:08:11,969
for them to acknowledge
it in any way.

118
00:08:12,003 --> 00:08:13,029
Rules?

119
00:08:13,073 --> 00:08:16,241
Well, it's more
of a taboo, really.

120
00:08:16,348 --> 00:08:19,048
Having a relationship
with a lover from a past life

121
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:21,059
is called a reassociation.

122
00:08:21,093 --> 00:08:24,899
And the Trill feel very strongly
that it's... unnatural.

123
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:25,906
Unnatural?

124
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,272
How can it be unnatural

125
00:08:27,343 --> 00:08:30,111
for a married couple
to resume their marriage?

126
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,679
Well, the whole point
of joining is for the symbiont

127
00:08:32,724 --> 00:08:36,895
to accumulate experiences
from the span of many lifetimes.

128
00:08:36,935 --> 00:08:38,838
In order to move on
from host to host

129
00:08:38,873 --> 00:08:41,641
the symbiont has to learn
to let go of the past

130
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,591
let go of parents, siblings,
children, even spouses.

131
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,494
I don't understand
how two people

132
00:08:48,531 --> 00:08:52,496
who have fallen in love
and made a life together

133
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:54,741
can be forced to just walk away
from each other

134
00:08:54,781 --> 00:08:56,182
because of a taboo.

135
00:08:56,218 --> 00:08:59,921
No. There must be some Trill
who have reassociated

136
00:08:59,962 --> 00:09:01,990
with people
from their past lives.

137
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:04,004
I asked Dax the same question.

138
00:09:04,038 --> 00:09:06,100
It seems there have been a few.

139
00:09:06,143 --> 00:09:08,080
And what happened?

140
00:09:08,116 --> 00:09:10,280
They were exiled
from the Trill homeworld.

141
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:13,318
That means the symbionts would
never be joined to a new host.

142
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:14,864
Exactly.

143
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:17,701
So when the hosts die,
the symbionts die with them.

144
00:09:17,741 --> 00:09:21,980
So, you see, even if Dax
does harbor feelings for Lenara,

145
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,514
she can't take that risk.

146
00:09:24,558 --> 00:09:25,686
For a joined Trill,

147
00:09:25,728 --> 00:09:27,790
nothing is more important
than to protect

148
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,101
the life of the symbiont.

149
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,906
Nothing.

150
00:09:40,332 --> 00:09:41,562
Come in.

151
00:09:46,782 --> 00:09:49,779
I had the feeling
you weren't going to be ready.

152
00:09:49,824 --> 00:09:52,422
Curzon was never
on time in his life.

153
00:09:52,497 --> 00:09:55,437
He was even late
for his 100th birthday party.

154
00:09:55,505 --> 00:09:57,943
You're never going to let me
forget that, are you?

155
00:09:57,978 --> 00:10:00,348
Do you know how long
it took me to plan that party?

156
00:10:00,384 --> 00:10:01,785
Three months.

157
00:10:01,821 --> 00:10:03,849
I know.

158
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:08,463
You still have time to back
out of the reception, you know.

159
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:12,242
Oh, you know
how I hate to miss a party.

160
00:10:12,282 --> 00:10:14,082
I'm serious.

161
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,284
I know.

162
00:10:16,326 --> 00:10:19,164
And I appreciate
what you're trying to do

163
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,108
but I'm going to be working
with Lenara for the next week.

164
00:10:23,143 --> 00:10:25,411
I have to get used
to being around her.

165
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:28,514
Stop worrying about me,
Benjamin.

166
00:10:28,558 --> 00:10:29,959
I'll be fine.

167
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:55,853
So, in the spirit of friendship,
we welcome you to Deep Space 9

168
00:10:55,896 --> 00:10:57,491
and wish you success

169
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:01,999
in the creation of the galaxy's
first artificial wormhole.

170
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:03,675
Hear, hear.

171
00:11:06,255 --> 00:11:08,158
I understand
you'll be commanding

172
00:11:08,193 --> 00:11:10,096
the <i>Defiant</i> during our research.

173
00:11:10,132 --> 00:11:11,431
Yes.

174
00:11:11,469 --> 00:11:13,737
You must be very excited.

175
00:11:13,775 --> 00:11:14,869
I mean, to be part

176
00:11:14,911 --> 00:11:17,349
of a potentially
history-making project.

177
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:20,790
I am...
Iooking forward to it.

178
00:11:21,963 --> 00:11:24,231
I think Mr. Worf is
less than enthusiastic

179
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:26,035
about heading
a research mission.

180
00:11:26,074 --> 00:11:28,444
It's not exactly
what every Klingon dreams about.

181
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,477
What do Klingons dream about?

182
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,634
Things that would send
cold chills down your spine

183
00:11:36,735 --> 00:11:40,906
and wake you
in the middle of the night.

184
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:43,544
No, no. It is better
you do not know.

185
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:45,352
Excuse me.

186
00:11:48,197 --> 00:11:50,635
I can never tell
when he's joking.

187
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:54,510
Maybe it is better
that we do not know.

188
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,204
Well, this looks wonderful.

189
00:12:20,248 --> 00:12:21,581
Mm-hmm.

190
00:12:21,618 --> 00:12:24,420
I take it most
of this is Bajoran.

191
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,018
<i>Hasperat.</i>

192
00:12:26,063 --> 00:12:28,159
Uh...

193
00:12:28,201 --> 00:12:29,227
No.

194
00:12:29,271 --> 00:12:31,071
<i>Hasperat.</i>

195
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:33,137
<i>Moba</i> fruit

196
00:12:33,181 --> 00:12:35,949
and <i>veklava.</i>

197
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:38,223
Of course, I'm not
the least bit hungry.

198
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:39,925
Neither am I.

199
00:12:43,073 --> 00:12:45,272
But I suppose we should
load up our plates

200
00:12:45,313 --> 00:12:47,113
since the whole room
is watching us.

201
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:53,600
Quite an audience.

202
00:12:53,634 --> 00:12:55,571
Seems a shame
to disappoint them.

203
00:12:55,606 --> 00:12:57,304
Maybe we should do something.

204
00:12:57,344 --> 00:13:00,250
Well, we could get
into a screaming match

205
00:13:00,284 --> 00:13:01,948
and start throwing
things at each other.

206
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,049
Not bad.

207
00:13:03,092 --> 00:13:06,225
Or I suppose we could throw
ourselves at each other

208
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:08,501
profess our undying
love for each other

209
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,708
in complete disregard
for Trill society.

210
00:13:11,748 --> 00:13:15,656
Dr. Pren would probably
have a heart attack.

211
00:13:15,691 --> 00:13:16,717
Forget about him.

212
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:18,629
My brother's head
would explode.

213
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,728
He's been a nervous wreck
ever since we arrived.

214
00:13:20,771 --> 00:13:22,639
I know the feeling.

215
00:13:24,648 --> 00:13:26,984
Well, I'll tell you
what I told him.

216
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:29,303
We're both mature adults,
and we can handle this.

217
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:34,037
I agree completely.

218
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:35,676
It'll be fine.

219
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:43,004
They're watching us again.

220
00:13:43,038 --> 00:13:44,507
I know.

221
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:48,177
I guess we'll probably
have to get used to it.

222
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:50,086
Well...

223
00:13:51,393 --> 00:13:54,299
thank you, Commander Dax.

224
00:13:54,368 --> 00:13:58,276
I appreciate your insightful
commentary on Bajoran cuisine.

225
00:13:58,311 --> 00:14:00,647
My pleasure, Dr. Kahn.

226
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,330
After we launch our target drone

227
00:14:34,372 --> 00:14:35,739
the <i>Defiant</i>
will have to generate

228
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,801
a subspace tensor matrix

229
00:14:36,845 --> 00:14:38,873
in the 25,000 to 30,000
Cochrane range.

230
00:14:38,917 --> 00:14:41,321
Then the drone will send out
a magneton pulse

231
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:43,156
which should
react with the matrix

232
00:14:43,194 --> 00:14:45,723
to create an opening
in the space-time continuum.

233
00:14:45,768 --> 00:14:48,833
How long will we have
to keep generating the matrix?

234
00:14:48,876 --> 00:14:50,311
Two minutes, maybe less.

235
00:14:50,346 --> 00:14:51,337
Once the wormhole forms,

236
00:14:51,382 --> 00:14:52,908
we could shut down
the tensor matrix.

237
00:14:52,953 --> 00:14:54,217
We'll have to reroute

238
00:14:54,257 --> 00:14:56,957
the preignition plasma
from the impulse deck

239
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:59,161
down to the auxiliary intake
to generate that much power

240
00:14:59,202 --> 00:15:01,036
but I think we can do it.

241
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:02,806
Excellent.

242
00:15:02,845 --> 00:15:04,543
We'll also need
to download our parameters

243
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,315
for the matrix
into one of your computers.

244
00:15:06,355 --> 00:15:08,850
I think we'd better use
the main computer, Chief.

245
00:15:08,894 --> 00:15:10,660
I don't think the Engineering
computer can handle it.

246
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:11,793
I agree.

247
00:15:11,836 --> 00:15:14,274
If you'll follow me,
I'll take you up to the Bridge

248
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:16,109
and we can begin
downloading the data.

249
00:15:16,146 --> 00:15:17,137
All right.

250
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,726
Everything looks good here.

251
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:26,637
Dax?

252
00:15:26,674 --> 00:15:28,304
The backup navigation program

253
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,407
is still showing
some calibration drift.

254
00:15:30,483 --> 00:15:32,386
I think some data
may have been lost

255
00:15:32,422 --> 00:15:33,618
in the start-up routine.

256
00:15:33,658 --> 00:15:34,957
Possibly.

257
00:15:34,996 --> 00:15:39,235
Well... that explains
the seven percent falloff

258
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,335
in AFR ratios I keep seeing.

259
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:43,578
Must be a problem
in the diagnostic subroutines.

260
00:15:43,617 --> 00:15:45,417
I have a recalibration
unit in my quarters

261
00:15:45,456 --> 00:15:46,720
that might solve the problem.

262
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:48,696
I'll have someone
bring it here.

263
00:15:48,732 --> 00:15:50,498
Oh, no, no,
I need a break anyway.

264
00:16:00,361 --> 00:16:02,993
Now I'm getting a drop-off
in the triple-R output.

265
00:16:03,034 --> 00:16:06,440
We might have a bigger problem
than the diagnostic subroutines.

266
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:12,319
Don't panic yet.

267
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:13,885
It could just be
transtator failure.

268
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:14,990
It happens all the time.

269
00:16:16,503 --> 00:16:18,167
I wasn't panicking.

270
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,976
It's just an expression.

271
00:16:21,015 --> 00:16:22,348
Sorry.

272
00:16:22,385 --> 00:16:24,356
No, I'm sorry.

273
00:16:26,796 --> 00:16:28,391
Forget it.

274
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:31,499
You know, it's just
that you always used to...

275
00:16:31,576 --> 00:16:33,810
I mean, Torias always
used to tell Nilani

276
00:16:33,849 --> 00:16:35,752
that she was panicking
about things

277
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,519
making a big fuss about nothing.

278
00:16:37,558 --> 00:16:41,625
Well, Torias used to be
insensitive at times.

279
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,400
But you have to admit

280
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,778
Nilani did do her share
of overreacting.

281
00:16:46,815 --> 00:16:48,547
That's because you were a pilot

282
00:16:48,653 --> 00:16:51,217
and it made me nervous...
made her nervous.

283
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,465
Torias being a pilot
made Nilani nervous.

284
00:16:59,314 --> 00:17:01,513
I've never had
quite this much trouble

285
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:05,028
sorting out my feelings
from those of a past host.

286
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:09,105
I know what you mean.

287
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,374
Probably another good reason

288
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:13,817
why we're not supposed
to spend much time together.

289
00:17:13,852 --> 00:17:17,726
We'd probably just
get lost in the past.

290
00:17:30,562 --> 00:17:33,502
Let's try running
the transtator diagnostic again.

291
00:17:33,536 --> 00:17:35,974
Okay.

292
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:40,579
Nilani wasn't panicking
the day before Torias died.

293
00:17:40,621 --> 00:17:42,022
No?

294
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:43,323
No.

295
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:46,062
Torias should have listened
to her.

296
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,546
The shuttle was not ready
for a full impulse test

297
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,987
but Torias had to do it anyway.

298
00:17:56,095 --> 00:17:58,089
And he was wrong

299
00:17:58,133 --> 00:18:01,403
and whatever part of me
is still Torias...

300
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,543
is very sorry...

301
00:18:06,054 --> 00:18:08,686
and wishes he'd listened to you.

302
00:18:16,982 --> 00:18:18,508
Well...

303
00:18:18,553 --> 00:18:21,823
we have a lot of work to do.

304
00:18:23,098 --> 00:18:24,796
Right.

305
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,097
Right.

306
00:18:36,734 --> 00:18:38,364
Would you be interested
in dinner?

307
00:18:38,405 --> 00:18:40,205
I mean

308
00:18:40,243 --> 00:18:42,807
I'm having dinner
with some friends

309
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,881
and I thought
you might like to go along.

310
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:49,366
Oh, I-I wouldn't want
to intrude on your friends.

311
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,134
Actually, it's not
that big of a group.

312
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:55,012
It's just me and...

313
00:18:55,048 --> 00:18:56,039
Julian.

314
00:18:57,321 --> 00:18:58,881
Dr. Bashir?

315
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:03,664
Sure.

316
00:19:03,704 --> 00:19:05,071
That sounds great.

317
00:19:06,143 --> 00:19:07,510
Great.

318
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:08,607
Okay.

319
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,918
Dinner, tonight.

320
00:19:10,956 --> 00:19:11,925
At Quark's.

321
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,154
Great.

322
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:18,607
Tonight?

323
00:19:18,643 --> 00:19:19,737
I can't.

324
00:19:19,812 --> 00:19:21,076
I have plans.

325
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:22,608
Cancel them.

326
00:19:22,653 --> 00:19:27,063
I mean, if you can cancel them,
that would be really nice.

327
00:19:27,097 --> 00:19:28,088
Nice.

328
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:29,103
Yeah.

329
00:19:29,137 --> 00:19:30,767
Because?

330
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,475
Because I invited Lenara
out for dinner and...

331
00:19:34,517 --> 00:19:37,319
And it would be less awkward
if you had a chaperon.

332
00:19:37,358 --> 00:19:38,452
Exactly.

333
00:19:38,494 --> 00:19:40,898
Will you do it?

334
00:19:40,933 --> 00:19:43,805
Something tells me
that I should say no

335
00:19:43,841 --> 00:19:45,937
but you know I won't.

336
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,949
What time?

337
00:19:46,982 --> 00:19:48,612
2200 at Quark's.

338
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,021
Thank you.

339
00:19:51,094 --> 00:19:52,290
I owe you one.

340
00:20:00,818 --> 00:20:03,222
No, it didn't have
a red awning.

341
00:20:03,258 --> 00:20:06,995
It had a big <i>ratana</i> tree
or something out front.

342
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:08,971
Well, you don't mean
the Barros Inn?

343
00:20:09,006 --> 00:20:10,236
Yes, that's it.

344
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:12,247
Curzon was kicked out
of the Barros Inn.

345
00:20:12,282 --> 00:20:15,849
That's one of the wildest bars
in the whole Rigel system.

346
00:20:15,891 --> 00:20:16,860
What did he do?

347
00:20:16,894 --> 00:20:19,093
He sort of set fire to it.

348
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:20,101
Sort of.

349
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,161
All right, he set fire to it

350
00:20:21,205 --> 00:20:22,333
but it wasn't deliberate.

351
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,901
It was part of a bet.

352
00:20:23,978 --> 00:20:26,610
But that's another story.

353
00:20:26,653 --> 00:20:29,593
Curzon was certainly...

354
00:20:29,626 --> 00:20:31,894
different
from most joined Trills.

355
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:34,337
Yeah, he liked to do things
his own way.

356
00:20:34,372 --> 00:20:37,608
He used to say there was
an exception to every rule

357
00:20:37,647 --> 00:20:41,061
and he usually went
out of his way to find it.

358
00:20:41,195 --> 00:20:44,294
I'm actually glad
we never met.

359
00:20:44,337 --> 00:20:46,605
We probably wouldn't have
liked each other very much.

360
00:20:46,642 --> 00:20:49,582
No, he wasn't
that bad, really.

361
00:20:49,617 --> 00:20:51,485
I tend to exaggerate
his rebellious qualities.

362
00:20:51,522 --> 00:20:53,858
But you may have a point.

363
00:20:53,895 --> 00:20:56,094
Curzon never had
much use for scientists.

364
00:20:56,134 --> 00:21:00,601
Well, that's interesting,
considering what you do now.

365
00:21:00,646 --> 00:21:03,084
Curzon would be horrified
to know that I'm a scientist.

366
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:08,064
Oh, the very idea
of doing research made him ill.

367
00:21:08,098 --> 00:21:10,536
Torias wasn't much different.

368
00:21:10,572 --> 00:21:12,942
I can remember talking to him

369
00:21:12,978 --> 00:21:17,319
about my wanting to study
theoretical quantum physics

370
00:21:17,356 --> 00:21:19,520
and his eyes glazing over.

371
00:21:19,561 --> 00:21:23,264
The irony is, you and I
have more in common

372
00:21:23,304 --> 00:21:26,142
than Torias and Nilani ever did.

373
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:28,241
That's right.

374
00:21:28,284 --> 00:21:29,844
Infirmary to Dr. Bashir.

375
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:33,192
Um, Dr. Bashir here.
Go ahead.

376
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,460
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
Doctor

377
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,098
but Ensign Tyler
has broken his leg and...

378
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,473
Oh, I'm on my way.

379
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,706
Um, I'm sorry.

380
00:21:39,747 --> 00:21:41,377
Uh, I must go.

381
00:21:41,485 --> 00:21:42,579
Duty calls.

382
00:21:42,621 --> 00:21:43,715
That's all right.

383
00:21:43,758 --> 00:21:45,091
Thanks for coming.

384
00:21:45,128 --> 00:21:47,760
It was nice to see you again.

385
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:53,648
Now that's a good friend.

386
00:21:53,684 --> 00:21:55,746
I mean, he sat here all night

387
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:58,957
listening to us trade stories
of our former hosts

388
00:21:58,997 --> 00:22:00,695
and never once complained.

389
00:22:00,735 --> 00:22:03,173
I think he enjoyed himself.

390
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,643
Mm-hmm.

391
00:22:04,678 --> 00:22:06,113
Maybe not.

392
00:22:06,148 --> 00:22:07,208
No.

393
00:22:09,223 --> 00:22:11,593
I'll make it up to him.

394
00:22:11,629 --> 00:22:13,395
Yeah.

395
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:15,803
Those are Klingon, aren't they?

396
00:22:15,841 --> 00:22:17,401
Yeah. How did you know?

397
00:22:17,512 --> 00:22:18,606
Curzon.

398
00:22:18,647 --> 00:22:19,741
They're beautiful.

399
00:22:19,784 --> 00:22:20,912
Yeah.

400
00:22:20,954 --> 00:22:24,258
They were given to me
by a, uh, Klingon scientist.

401
00:22:24,295 --> 00:22:26,995
He wanted to give me
one of the swords

402
00:22:27,036 --> 00:22:29,338
they carry around,
but I refused.

403
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,940
Keep them.

404
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,316
Really.

405
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:35,655
I'm not very Klingon.

406
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,801
Thanks.

407
00:22:39,836 --> 00:22:40,862
Well?

408
00:22:40,906 --> 00:22:43,572
They suit you.

409
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,162
It's really good
to see you again, Dax.

410
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:53,433
Oh, that sounds
so strange.

411
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,842
I mean, I'm looking
at a different face

412
00:22:55,878 --> 00:22:57,746
hearing a different voice...

413
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:01,859
but somehow it's still you.

414
00:23:01,893 --> 00:23:03,453
I know.

415
00:23:03,564 --> 00:23:07,472
Every time
I start to think of you

416
00:23:07,575 --> 00:23:11,882
as just Lenara,
you'll smile, or laugh

417
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,156
and suddenly it's you.

418
00:23:21,979 --> 00:23:25,477
I'm really glad you're here.

419
00:23:28,061 --> 00:23:29,827
Me, too.

420
00:23:43,702 --> 00:23:48,112
<i>Defiant</i> Log, Stardate 49195.5.

421
00:23:48,146 --> 00:23:50,550
Lieutenant Commander Worf
reporting.

422
00:23:50,586 --> 00:23:52,580
We have arrived
at the coordinates

423
00:23:52,626 --> 00:23:54,290
to begin preliminary tests

424
00:23:54,329 --> 00:23:56,528
for the artificial
wormhole project.

425
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:59,600
Target drone is in position,
Commander.

426
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,736
Full scan.

427
00:24:03,553 --> 00:24:05,148
No ships in sensor range.

428
00:24:05,191 --> 00:24:06,160
Bridge to Engineering.

429
00:24:06,193 --> 00:24:07,753
Are you ready, Mr. Eddington?

430
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:08,994
We're ready, Commander.

431
00:24:09,035 --> 00:24:12,499
Dr. Kahn... you may proceed.

432
00:24:12,543 --> 00:24:14,343
Energize the focal array

433
00:24:14,381 --> 00:24:18,084
and stand by to initiate
the subspace tensor matrix.

434
00:24:26,413 --> 00:24:30,253
This AQF sequencer
is always causing me problems.

435
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,318
Plasma coil interlocks
are in place.

436
00:24:32,361 --> 00:24:35,597
Deflector grid is charged
and standing by.

437
00:24:35,636 --> 00:24:37,436
They're very friendly today.

438
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:38,842
Hmm?

439
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:41,316
They had dinner
last night... alone.

440
00:24:41,351 --> 00:24:43,447
What are you trying to say?

441
00:24:43,491 --> 00:24:45,655
I shouldn't have
to say anything.

442
00:24:45,696 --> 00:24:47,826
Then don't.

443
00:24:47,869 --> 00:24:54,011
We're ready to generate
the tensor matrix.

444
00:24:54,051 --> 00:24:56,319
The drone is standing by.

445
00:24:56,357 --> 00:24:58,795
Initialize the focal array.

446
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,847
The tensor matrix is forming.

447
00:25:06,918 --> 00:25:08,353
Activate the drone.

448
00:25:08,389 --> 00:25:11,157
The drone is sending out
the magneton pulse.

449
00:25:11,196 --> 00:25:12,756
It's reached the matrix.

450
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,498
I'm picking up
a subspace distortion.

451
00:25:14,537 --> 00:25:16,508
The distortion's
becoming coherent.

452
00:25:16,543 --> 00:25:18,173
It's working.

453
00:25:18,214 --> 00:25:20,516
The magneton pulse
is causing a feedback loop.

454
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:22,421
It'll destroy the drone
in a few seconds.

455
00:25:22,458 --> 00:25:25,398
A few seconds is all we need.

456
00:25:35,927 --> 00:25:39,026
The drone's been destroyed.

457
00:25:39,068 --> 00:25:40,537
But you did it.

458
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,007
Congratulations, Doctor.

459
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,706
Thank you.

460
00:25:43,747 --> 00:25:45,684
That was only the first step

461
00:25:45,718 --> 00:25:47,518
but what a step.

462
00:25:47,556 --> 00:25:48,616
I'm so proud.

463
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,686
Thank you.

464
00:25:49,729 --> 00:25:51,198
I'm so proud.

465
00:26:03,699 --> 00:26:06,730
...the subspace field data,
the quantum readings...

466
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,674
all the telemetry checks out.

467
00:26:08,712 --> 00:26:12,210
The wormhole was
open 23.4 seconds

468
00:26:12,254 --> 00:26:14,054
and during that time,
it was completely coherent.

469
00:26:14,093 --> 00:26:16,429
You couldn't ask
for a better beginning.

470
00:26:16,465 --> 00:26:18,561
But it all comes down
to the next test.

471
00:26:18,604 --> 00:26:21,476
We have to be able to send
an object through the wormhole

472
00:26:21,511 --> 00:26:23,779
to prove that it's stable
for space travel.

473
00:26:23,884 --> 00:26:24,783
Oh, that reminds me.

474
00:26:24,887 --> 00:26:27,086
Dax thinks we should use
a class-4 probe

475
00:26:27,126 --> 00:26:28,721
to make the actual run with.

476
00:26:28,764 --> 00:26:30,359
She says that
the class-4 shielding

477
00:26:30,402 --> 00:26:31,632
will give us a better idea

478
00:26:31,671 --> 00:26:33,801
of how the wormhole
will affect a real ship.

479
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:36,577
I didn't know you'd talked
to Dax since we got back.

480
00:26:36,618 --> 00:26:38,817
Yeah, I saw her last night.

481
00:26:38,856 --> 00:26:40,325
Where?

482
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,026
She came by my quarters.

483
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,540
How long did she stay?

484
00:26:46,744 --> 00:26:49,718
Is there something
you want to ask me?

485
00:26:49,751 --> 00:26:52,816
I don't want to ask you anything

486
00:26:52,859 --> 00:26:55,833
but I'm beginning to wonder
if I should.

487
00:27:00,613 --> 00:27:02,208
I don't believe this.

488
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,465
Believe it.

489
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:05,399
People are starting to notice.

490
00:27:05,437 --> 00:27:06,633
People?

491
00:27:06,674 --> 00:27:09,442
Dr. Pren saw you holding hands
at dinner the other night.

492
00:27:09,481 --> 00:27:10,677
I thought he was overreacting

493
00:27:10,717 --> 00:27:11,686
but then I saw the way

494
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,554
the two of you were acting
on the <i>Defiant.</i>

495
00:27:14,661 --> 00:27:15,755
Lenara.

496
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:21,638
Lenara. Lenara.

497
00:27:25,856 --> 00:27:27,382
I'm sorry.

498
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,035
I'm sorry.

499
00:27:33,576 --> 00:27:35,570
Look, I'm your brother.

500
00:27:37,052 --> 00:27:40,322
You tell me
nothing's going on...

501
00:27:40,361 --> 00:27:42,595
then nothing's going on.

502
00:27:44,305 --> 00:27:46,971
I just want
to hear you say it.

503
00:27:49,652 --> 00:27:52,558
There is nothing going on.

504
00:27:55,066 --> 00:27:56,592
All right?

505
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,206
All right.

506
00:28:24,876 --> 00:28:26,277
Come in.

507
00:28:32,497 --> 00:28:33,932
What's wrong?

508
00:28:35,537 --> 00:28:38,135
I just had the most
unpleasant conversation

509
00:28:38,178 --> 00:28:40,650
with my brother.

510
00:28:40,684 --> 00:28:42,552
He...

511
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:46,463
he thinks that there's something
going on between us.

512
00:28:47,469 --> 00:28:48,904
Oh.

513
00:28:48,939 --> 00:28:51,001
And what did you tell him?

514
00:28:51,044 --> 00:28:52,674
Well, I told him
that that was ridiculous.

515
00:28:52,715 --> 00:28:54,983
That there's nothing
going on between us.

516
00:28:55,022 --> 00:28:56,491
That you and I are just friends.

517
00:28:56,525 --> 00:28:58,689
Well, then,
that should settle that.

518
00:29:00,435 --> 00:29:02,703
Maybe we shouldn't
see each other.

519
00:29:02,775 --> 00:29:05,543
It'll just give people
the wrong idea.

520
00:29:05,582 --> 00:29:08,350
Or give them the right idea.

521
00:29:13,068 --> 00:29:16,133
I don't think we should have
this conversation.

522
00:29:16,176 --> 00:29:18,306
Would it do any good?

523
00:29:18,349 --> 00:29:21,687
Would it change
how either of us feels?

524
00:29:25,668 --> 00:29:27,764
No.

525
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,606
But it would be easier.

526
00:29:29,645 --> 00:29:32,744
You've never been one
for the easy way out.

527
00:29:32,786 --> 00:29:35,020
That's true, but in this case...

528
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:37,657
I'm not the only one involved.

529
00:29:50,131 --> 00:29:53,503
I don't want to do
anything to hurt you.

530
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,104
I did that before.

531
00:29:56,146 --> 00:29:57,615
I climbed into a shuttlecraft

532
00:29:57,651 --> 00:29:58,847
and I made you a widow.

533
00:29:58,954 --> 00:30:00,982
I knew you were a pilot
when I married you.

534
00:30:01,026 --> 00:30:02,256
I knew the risks.

535
00:30:02,296 --> 00:30:05,030
I went into it
with my eyes wide open.

536
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:07,006
And what about now?

537
00:30:07,042 --> 00:30:09,310
Are your eyes open?

538
00:30:09,347 --> 00:30:12,344
Do you know
what the risks are?

539
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:18,463
I thought I'd...

540
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,372
I thought I'd gotten over you.

541
00:30:23,785 --> 00:30:28,526
It's been so long
and so much has happened.

542
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:33,943
And now I know I haven't.

543
00:30:40,261 --> 00:30:41,525
Shh.

544
00:30:41,565 --> 00:30:42,932
Shh, shh.

545
00:30:43,938 --> 00:30:45,373
I've missed you.

546
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:49,115
I've missed you so much.

547
00:31:21,535 --> 00:31:23,665
I'd better go.

548
00:31:24,977 --> 00:31:26,709
Yeah.

549
00:31:50,644 --> 00:31:52,946
I don't know what to do,
Benjamin.

550
00:31:52,983 --> 00:31:55,011
What do you want to do?

551
00:31:55,055 --> 00:31:57,584
Throw myself at her

552
00:31:57,628 --> 00:31:59,360
profess my undying love

553
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,670
and my complete disregard
for Trill society.

554
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:08,656
A joke Lenara made
at the reception.

555
00:32:08,691 --> 00:32:10,719
It doesn't sound so funny
anymore, does it?

556
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,494
Not really.

557
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:15,132
You don't think
I should pursue this, do you?

558
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,979
No.

559
00:32:19,017 --> 00:32:20,647
Okay.

560
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,180
Why?

561
00:32:22,226 --> 00:32:26,829
Because I remember what Curzon
used to say about reassociation

562
00:32:26,871 --> 00:32:30,404
that it didn't matter whether
he agreed with the taboo or not

563
00:32:30,447 --> 00:32:33,615
because the price
for violating it was too high...

564
00:32:33,655 --> 00:32:35,455
exile.

565
00:32:35,494 --> 00:32:36,463
I know what Curzon

566
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,730
used to say...
and I'm not Curzon.

567
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:40,706
And you're not Torias either.

568
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,110
You're Jadzia Dax

569
00:32:43,147 --> 00:32:46,850
and you have a responsibility
as a joined Trill to never...

570
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,758
I didn't come here
to hear a lecture

571
00:32:48,795 --> 00:32:50,162
about my responsibilities.

572
00:32:50,265 --> 00:32:52,533
You came here
for advice from a friend

573
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:54,975
and that's exactly
what you're getting.

574
00:32:56,181 --> 00:32:57,650
You're right.

575
00:32:59,021 --> 00:33:00,581
I'm sorry.

576
00:33:02,965 --> 00:33:05,129
I know this is difficult
for you.

577
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:07,266
I know how you feel
about Lenara

578
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:11,082
but I want you to think
about what will happen

579
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:12,987
if you pursue this.

580
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:16,157
If you're exiled from Trill

581
00:33:16,266 --> 00:33:20,539
there will be no further hosts
for your symbiont.

582
00:33:20,577 --> 00:33:25,112
When Jadzia dies, Dax dies.

583
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,532
That goes against
everything you were taught

584
00:33:29,567 --> 00:33:31,538
during your initiate training.

585
00:33:31,572 --> 00:33:34,410
You've told me again and again

586
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:38,513
that each host
is only a link in a chain...

587
00:33:39,827 --> 00:33:41,593
and that the life
of the symbiont

588
00:33:41,631 --> 00:33:45,072
no matter what happens,
must go on.

589
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:46,873
I know that...

590
00:33:48,482 --> 00:33:50,510
and I believe in that.

591
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,793
But I also know...

592
00:33:56,136 --> 00:33:58,472
I love her, Benjamin.

593
00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:05,555
I know you do.

594
00:34:07,933 --> 00:34:09,733
If I were in your position

595
00:34:09,771 --> 00:34:14,512
I'd probably be just as ready
to throw away everything

596
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,145
for the person I love.

597
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:18,302
But I would also
want to be sure

598
00:34:18,435 --> 00:34:23,210
that I was ready
to pay the price.

599
00:34:23,248 --> 00:34:25,378
You're right.

600
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,756
I need to be sure.

601
00:34:36,716 --> 00:34:38,276
But if you're sure...

602
00:34:39,457 --> 00:34:42,829
if this is what
you really want...

603
00:34:42,865 --> 00:34:46,466
I will back you all the way.

604
00:34:51,588 --> 00:34:54,322
I've lived seven lifetimes

605
00:34:54,362 --> 00:34:58,270
and I have never had
a friend quite like you.

606
00:35:11,105 --> 00:35:12,131
Eddington to Bridge.

607
00:35:12,175 --> 00:35:14,374
We're ready to generate
the tensor matrix.

608
00:35:14,414 --> 00:35:15,474
Understood.
Stand by.

609
00:35:15,517 --> 00:35:16,486
Aye, sir.

610
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,614
Commander Dax.

611
00:35:17,656 --> 00:35:20,151
Subspace field stress is
within normal parameters.

612
00:35:20,196 --> 00:35:21,894
Probe's ready to launch.

613
00:35:21,934 --> 00:35:24,133
Target drone is in position.

614
00:35:24,172 --> 00:35:26,268
Bridge to Engine Room.

615
00:35:26,312 --> 00:35:28,340
Initialize subspace matrix,
Mr. Eddington.

616
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,048
On my mark.

617
00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:31,718
Acknowledged.

618
00:35:36,471 --> 00:35:39,445
The tensor matrix
is starting to form.

619
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:40,971
Activate the drone.

620
00:35:52,814 --> 00:35:55,252
Wormhole neutrino readings
are stable.

621
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:57,816
Subspace field stress
is up by 15 percent

622
00:35:57,927 --> 00:35:59,693
but still within safety margins.

623
00:35:59,732 --> 00:36:01,498
Launch the probe.

624
00:36:17,244 --> 00:36:18,338
Report!

625
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,406
No helm control!

626
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:21,684
There's a hull breach
on deck five.

627
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:24,024
Emergency force fields
are in place.

628
00:36:24,062 --> 00:36:25,258
I'm reading
a massive plasma leak

629
00:36:25,298 --> 00:36:26,289
in the Engine Room.

630
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,839
Bridge to Engine Room!

631
00:36:28,941 --> 00:36:29,840
Mr. Eddington!

632
00:36:29,943 --> 00:36:32,381
Dr. Kahn, can you hear me?

633
00:36:34,221 --> 00:36:36,887
Have a damage control team
meet me down there.

634
00:36:47,857 --> 00:36:49,452
Stand back.

635
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:59,251
It's out of control!

636
00:36:59,286 --> 00:37:02,226
We can't put it out with those!

637
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:05,759
We'll have to vent the entire
compartment out into space.

638
00:37:05,804 --> 00:37:07,798
No! Lenara might still be alive.

639
00:37:07,842 --> 00:37:09,437
There's no way to get to her.

640
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:11,883
How long will a level-A
force field last in here?

641
00:37:11,985 --> 00:37:13,615
Not long with that plasma fire.

642
00:37:13,657 --> 00:37:15,126
Ten, 20 seconds at most.

643
00:37:15,161 --> 00:37:16,859
I think I can get to her.

644
00:37:16,898 --> 00:37:18,231
Dax, if we don't
contain this thing now

645
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:20,263
it's going
to set off the warp core.

646
00:37:20,308 --> 00:37:22,279
I know,
just give me ten seconds

647
00:37:22,313 --> 00:37:23,839
after the force field
goes off

648
00:37:23,883 --> 00:37:25,513
and then vent the compartment.

649
00:37:25,554 --> 00:37:27,582
I need to reconfigure
the field geometry.

650
00:37:27,626 --> 00:37:31,032
I'll try to keep the field
stable as long as I can.

651
00:38:17,924 --> 00:38:20,088
Oh, Dax...

652
00:38:20,129 --> 00:38:21,793
I thought I'd lost you.

653
00:38:21,834 --> 00:38:23,498
Oh, so did I.

654
00:38:23,538 --> 00:38:25,772
I don't want to lose you.

655
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,508
Not again.

656
00:38:27,548 --> 00:38:28,915
Not again.

657
00:38:28,952 --> 00:38:30,285
Never again.

658
00:38:30,323 --> 00:38:32,921
Never again. Never.

659
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:49,402
Come in.

660
00:38:51,545 --> 00:38:53,014
How are you feeling?

661
00:38:53,048 --> 00:38:54,017
Much better.

662
00:38:54,051 --> 00:38:55,611
She's almost fully recovered.

663
00:38:55,655 --> 00:38:57,626
My brother, the nurse.

664
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:01,124
I want to thank you
for what you did.

665
00:39:01,169 --> 00:39:04,473
Lenara means a lot to me.

666
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:06,414
To both of us.

667
00:39:09,257 --> 00:39:11,023
Yes.

668
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,063
I'll leave you two alone.

669
00:39:26,301 --> 00:39:28,465
Risian perfume.

670
00:39:34,322 --> 00:39:36,886
Do they know what happened
to the wormhole yet?

671
00:39:36,929 --> 00:39:39,231
Our best guess is
that the tetryon field

672
00:39:39,268 --> 00:39:42,265
reacted to the probe's
shielding, producing a massive

673
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,745
graviton wave.

674
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,150
The important thing is
no one got killed

675
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:49,022
and we brought the ship back
in one piece.

676
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:52,593
Oh, the ship...
how badly was it damaged?

677
00:39:52,636 --> 00:39:55,804
Chief O'Brien says he'll have it
good as new in two weeks.

678
00:39:55,844 --> 00:39:59,148
Now stop torturing yourself.

679
00:39:59,187 --> 00:40:01,124
It wasn't your fault.

680
00:40:01,158 --> 00:40:03,687
It was my project, my theories.

681
00:40:03,732 --> 00:40:05,498
And you shouldn't forget

682
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:07,005
that your project
and your theories

683
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,342
produced the first
artificially created

684
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,781
wormhole in history.

685
00:40:10,816 --> 00:40:13,152
It's a huge achievement.

686
00:40:13,189 --> 00:40:14,989
You're right.

687
00:40:15,028 --> 00:40:18,765
I am being a little self-
indulgent, aren't I?

688
00:40:18,804 --> 00:40:21,072
Yes, you are.

689
00:40:22,414 --> 00:40:24,408
Well, I guess I'll have
a lot of work to do

690
00:40:24,452 --> 00:40:25,648
when I get back to Trill.

691
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:28,389
Analyzing the telemetry
from the probe alone

692
00:40:28,429 --> 00:40:30,263
will probably take months.

693
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,168
Probably.

694
00:40:36,818 --> 00:40:39,086
Why not do the work
here with me?

695
00:40:41,329 --> 00:40:43,300
With you.

696
00:40:45,206 --> 00:40:48,180
The two of us together, you know
what that would mean.

697
00:40:48,214 --> 00:40:50,914
I know exactly
what that would mean...

698
00:40:50,954 --> 00:40:54,156
but I think
it's worth the price.

699
00:40:57,036 --> 00:40:58,666
That's funny.

700
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:01,510
Bejal just spent
the last half hour

701
00:41:01,548 --> 00:41:04,282
trying to convince me
that it wouldn't be worth it.

702
00:41:04,389 --> 00:41:07,956
He wants me to go back to Trill
with him, tomorrow...

703
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:10,060
try to forget about you.

704
00:41:10,104 --> 00:41:12,147
Well, at least he's consistent.

705
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,046
Don't be too hard on him.

706
00:41:14,085 --> 00:41:17,389
He's only trying to look out
for his big sister.

707
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,466
Everyone is trying
to look out for us...

708
00:41:22,507 --> 00:41:25,709
protect us from ourselves.

709
00:41:27,454 --> 00:41:29,550
But in the end...

710
00:41:29,592 --> 00:41:32,394
all that matters is how we feel

711
00:41:32,433 --> 00:41:34,199
and what we do about it

712
00:41:34,237 --> 00:41:35,638
because either way

713
00:41:35,675 --> 00:41:38,706
we're the ones who have to live
with the consequences.

714
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:42,122
That's the tricky part, though,
isn't it?

715
00:41:42,158 --> 00:41:44,653
Living with the consequences.

716
00:41:44,698 --> 00:41:47,934
When you're not with me

717
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:50,275
when you're not around...

718
00:41:50,313 --> 00:41:53,185
it's like a part of me
is missing.

719
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,658
I want to be with you
more than anything

720
00:41:55,694 --> 00:41:57,996
but I don't think
that I can do this.

721
00:41:58,032 --> 00:42:01,599
Dax, I am not like you.

722
00:42:01,642 --> 00:42:03,545
I don't have
a little Curzon inside me

723
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,950
telling me to be impulsive,
to ignore the rules

724
00:42:05,986 --> 00:42:08,220
to give up everything
that I've worked for.

725
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,925
Can you really walk away
from me?

726
00:42:10,966 --> 00:42:11,957
From us?

727
00:42:12,002 --> 00:42:13,335
After all this time

728
00:42:13,373 --> 00:42:15,641
we're together.

729
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,843
Don't throw that away.

730
00:42:17,884 --> 00:42:19,855
I don't want to!

731
00:42:22,295 --> 00:42:24,790
Maybe I need more time.

732
00:42:24,835 --> 00:42:27,637
Maybe if I go back to Trill
for a while

733
00:42:27,676 --> 00:42:30,274
I-I'll think it over. I...

734
00:42:30,316 --> 00:42:32,184
I can always come back later.

735
00:42:36,131 --> 00:42:39,003
I wish I could believe you.

736
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:43,710
But ultimately
it comes down to this...

737
00:42:43,751 --> 00:42:48,719
if you feel about me
the way I feel about you

738
00:42:48,764 --> 00:42:52,604
you won't go
on that transport tomorrow

739
00:42:52,641 --> 00:42:56,276
and if you do leave,
I think we both know...

740
00:42:57,988 --> 00:43:00,654
you're never coming back again.

741
00:43:28,401 --> 00:43:31,101
Good-bye, Commander.
Thank you.
