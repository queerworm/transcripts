1
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,849
It's a trick.

2
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,892
Of course, it's a trick,
but how did she do it?

3
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:19,979
She probably beamed the egg
directly into her mouth

4
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:22,063
from one of
the transporters.

5
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:24,358
Actually,
one of my previous hosts

6
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,735
used to dabble
in the sleight of hand.

7
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:27,695
Was it Tobin?

8
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:28,946
DAX: That's right.

9
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,531
Ah, he sounds like
the right type--

10
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,157
painfully shy,
introverted,

11
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,075
a slight lack
of confidence--

12
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:36,620
just the kind of person
who might want to dazzle

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,163
the world with his
magical abilities.

14
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,541
She swallowed the egg
before she came into the bar

15
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,002
and then
regurgitated it on cue.

16
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:45,546
Quite disgusting, actually.

17
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:46,547
Wrong again.

18
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:47,548
(<i> beeping</i> )

19
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:48,966
Sisko to Dax.

20
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,718
I'd like to see you
in my office, Commander.

21
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,678
On my way, Benjamin.

22
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:53,846
Don't worry, Quark.

23
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:56,181
You'll figure it out eventually.

24
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,599
What?

25
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,769
No wonder
you can't figure it out.

26
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:02,897
Your head's full
of latinum.

27
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:03,856
(<i> laughs</i> )

28
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:05,524
Ladies and gentlemen,

29
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:08,569
the amazing Jadzia Dax.

30
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,048
Have a seat.

31
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:33,218
A Trill science team
is coming to the station

32
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,387
to conduct field tests
on experimental techniques

33
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,056
for creating
artificial wormholes.

34
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:38,682
It sounds interesting.

35
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,559
It's an important
project,

36
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,061
and I've agreed
to let them use

37
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:45,022
the<i> Defiant</i> for
their experiments.

38
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,857
But I thought you
would want to know

39
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,943
that the leader
of the science team

40
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:51,737
is Dr. Lenara Kahn.

41
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,785
Lenara Kahn.

42
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,703
That's right.

43
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,539
Look, you've got
about three months

44
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,083
of leave accumulated.

45
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,209
Why don't you
take some of it?

46
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:09,004
We can afford to do without you
for a while.

47
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:13,341
Am I that dispensable
around here?

48
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,803
We'll never notice you're gone.

49
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,017
No.

50
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,102
I'll stay.

51
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:24,895
I can handle it.

52
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,063
You're sure.

53
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,815
I'm sure.

54
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:30,901
I've never let my past lives
interfere with my job,

55
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,070
and I'm not going to start now.

56
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,154
I'll be fine.

57
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,031
Okay.

58
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,122
But...

59
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:45,666
thank you
for giving me the option.

60
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,002
Anytime, old man.

61
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:09,314
I'm Dr. Hanor Pren
of the Trill Science Ministry.

62
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,899
I'm Major Kira Nerys,

63
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,234
and I'd like to welcome you
to Deep Space 9.

64
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:16,571
This is our Strategic Operations
Officer, Commander Worf,

65
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,658
and this is our Science Officer,
Commander Dax.

66
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,953
Allow me to introduce you
to our team leader

67
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:29,168
Dr. Lenara Kahn and her brother,
Dr. Bejal Otner.

68
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:30,251
Major Kira,

69
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,420
Commander Worf,

70
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,173
and Commander Dax.

71
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,057
It's been a long time.

72
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:45,017
Yes, it has.

73
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:47,394
If you will come with me,
I will show you

74
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,604
to your quarters.

75
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,029
You know that woman.

76
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,741
I know her.

77
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,993
She used to be my wife.

78
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,366
So let me get this straight.

79
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:11,412
Dax's first host
was named Lela, right?

80
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,413
I think so.

81
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,916
Lela Dax.
That's right.

82
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,626
Then Lela dies

83
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,879
and the Dax symbiont goes on
to a man named Tobin,

84
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:24,051
and after Tobin dies,
then it's on to Emony,

85
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,720
then Torias,
Audrid...

86
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,847
No, no. Audrid, then Torias.

87
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,724
Sorry.

88
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:35,770
Audrid, Torias, Joran, Curzon
and then eventually, Jadzia.

89
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,397
Right.

90
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:43,402
And this, uh, Dr. Lenara Kahn
person was once married to...?

91
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:46,281
Torias, but, of course, in
those days, she wasn't Lenara.

92
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,158
I knew
it couldn't be that simple.

93
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,409
And the Kahn symbiont,
which is now joined to Lenara

94
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,871
used to be joined to
a woman named Nilani.

95
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,332
And it was Nilani who
married Torias Dax.

96
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,167
But Torias was killed
in a shuttle accident.

97
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,417
And Nilani
became a widow.

98
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,419
Years later,
when Nilani died,

99
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,756
the Kahn symbiont
was joined to Lenara.

100
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:08,387
And now, Nilani is Lenara,
and Torias is Jadzia.

101
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:12,224
So that makes Lenara
Jadzia's ex-wife.

102
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:15,143
It's a little more complicated
than that, Quark.

103
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,853
I'm sure it is,
but to be honest,

104
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,646
I'm sorry I brought
the whole thing up.

105
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,274
It's giving me a headache.

106
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,025
It must be
all the latinum

107
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,860
rattling
around in there.

108
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,908
Oh.

109
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,201
I thought so.

110
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,203
You really should
have that looked at.

111
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,959
Get back to work!

112
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,170
If you'll
excuse me...

113
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,593
Dax teach
you that?

114
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,928
Next time, I'm
going to pull

115
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:50,929
a rabbit out
of his ear.

116
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,850
The one thing
I don't understand

117
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,270
is why Dax and Lenara
can't just pick up

118
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,980
where they left off--

119
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,442
I mean,<i> if</i> they're still
in love with each other.

120
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,026
Ah, now there's the rub.

121
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,528
Even if they do harbor
feelings for each other,

122
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,572
it's strictly against
the rules of Trill society

123
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,075
for them to acknowledge
it in any way.

124
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,368
Rules?

125
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,579
Well, it's more
of a taboo, really.

126
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,747
Having a relationship

127
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,249
with a lover
from a past life

128
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,460
is called a reassociation.

129
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,130
And the Trill feel very strongly
that it's... unnatural.

130
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,173
Unnatural?

131
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,590
How can it be unnatural

132
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,093
for a married couple
to resume their marriage?

133
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,511
Well, the
whole point

134
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,180
of joining is for the symbiont

135
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,058
to accumulate experiences
from the span of many lifetimes.

136
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,977
In order to move on
from host to host,

137
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,813
the symbiont has to learn
to let go of the past,

138
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:46,693
let go of parents, siblings,
children, even spouses.

139
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,695
I don't understand
how two people

140
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:52,699
who have fallen in love
and made a life together

141
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,784
can be forced to just walk away
from each other

142
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,328
because of a taboo.

143
00:08:56,328 --> 00:09:00,123
No. There must be some Trill
who have reassociated

144
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,292
with people
from their past lives.

145
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,002
I asked Dax
the same question.

146
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,254
It seems there
have been a few.

147
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,173
And what happened?

148
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,384
They were exiled
from the Trill homeworld.

149
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:13,428
That means the symbionts would
never be joined to a new host.

150
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,971
Exactly.

151
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,891
So when the hosts die,
the symbionts die with them.

152
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:21,895
So, you see, even if Dax
does harbor feelings for Lenara,

153
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,731
she can't take that risk.

154
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,066
For a joined Trill,

155
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,942
nothing is more important
than to protect

156
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,111
the life of the symbiont.

157
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,030
Nothing.

158
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,490
(<i> sighs</i> )

159
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,455
(<i> door chimes</i> )

160
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,540
Come in.

161
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,756
I had the feeling
you weren't going to be ready.

162
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,299
Curzon was never

163
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,009
on time in his life.

164
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,636
He was even late
for his 100th
birthday party.

165
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,972
You're never going to let me
forget that, are you?

166
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,475
Do you know how long
it took me to plan that party?

167
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:01,726
Three months.

168
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,895
I know.

169
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:08,525
You still have time to back
out of the reception, you know.

170
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:12,237
Oh, you know
how I hate to miss a party.

171
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,197
I'm serious.

172
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,491
I know.

173
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,119
And I appreciate
what you're trying to do,

174
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:23,081
but I'm going to be working
with Lenara for the next week.

175
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,542
I have to get used
to being around her.

176
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,586
Stop worrying about me,

177
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:28,545
Benjamin.

178
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,879
I'll be fine.

179
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,559
(<i> conversation and laughter</i> )

180
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:53,194
So, in the spirit of friendship,

181
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,863
we welcome you to Deep Space 9

182
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,324
and wish you success

183
00:10:57,324 --> 00:11:00,827
in the creation
of the galaxy's

184
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:01,869
first artificial wormhole.

185
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,538
Hear, hear.

186
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,084
I understand you'll
be commanding

187
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,919
the<i> Defiant</i>
during our research.

188
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,254
Yes.

189
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,590
You must be very excited.

190
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,841
I mean, to be part

191
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,093
of a potentially
history-making project.

192
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,514
I am...
looking forward to it.

193
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,017
I think Mr. Worf is
less than enthusiastic

194
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,810
about heading
a research mission.

195
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,313
It's not exactly
what every Klingon
dreams about.

196
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,274
What<i> do</i> Klingons
dream about?

197
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:36,779
Things that would send
cold chills down your spine

198
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,615
and wake you

199
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,825
in the middle
of the night.

200
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,495
No, no. It is better
you do not know.

201
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,121
Excuse me.

202
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,544
I can never tell
when he's joking.

203
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:54,214
Maybe it<i> is</i> better
that we do not know.

204
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,965
(<i> both laughing</i> )

205
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,947
Well, this
looks wonderful.

206
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,366
Mm-hmm.

207
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:24,118
I take it most
of this is Bajoran.

208
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,744
<i>Hasperat.</i>

209
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,872
Uh...

210
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:28,956
No.

211
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,791
<i>Hasperat.</i>

212
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,835
<i>Moba</i> fruit

213
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,672
and<i> veklava.</i>

214
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,924
Of course, I'm not
the least bit hungry.

215
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,634
Neither am I.

216
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,098
But I suppose we should
load up our plates

217
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,807
since the whole room
is watching us.

218
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,273
Quite an audience.

219
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,191
Seems a shame
to disappoint them.

220
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,026
Maybe we should
do something.

221
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,987
Well, we could get
into a screaming match

222
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,406
and start throwing
things at each other.

223
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,865
Not bad.

224
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,952
Or I suppose we could throw
ourselves at each other,

225
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,413
profess our undying
love for each other

226
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:11,499
in complete disregard
for Trill society.

227
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:15,128
Dr. Pren would probably
have a heart attack.

228
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,379
Forget about him.

229
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,506
My brother's head
would explode.

230
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,550
He's been a nervous wreck
ever since we arrived.

231
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,260
I know the feeling.

232
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,640
Well, I'll tell you
what I told him.

233
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,643
We're both mature adults,
and we can handle this.

234
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,105
I agree completely.

235
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,856
It'll be fine.

236
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,281
They're watching us again.

237
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,741
I know.

238
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:48,495
I guess we'll probably
have to get used to it.

239
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,246
Well...

240
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,751
thank you, Commander Dax.

241
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:58,630
I appreciate your insightful
commentary on Bajoran cuisine.

242
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,965
My pleasure, Dr. Kahn.

243
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,791
BEJAL: After we launch
our target drone,

244
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,083
the<i> Defiant</i>
will have to generate

245
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,502
a subspace tensor matrix

246
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,546
in the 25,000 to 30,000
Cochrane range.

247
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,922
Then the drone will send out
a magneton pulse,

248
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,758
which should
react with the matrix

249
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:46,427
to create an opening
in the space-time continuum.

250
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,637
How long will we have

251
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,556
to keep generating
the matrix?

252
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,391
Two minutes, maybe less.

253
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,476
Once the wormhole
forms, we could shut
down the tensor matrix.

254
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:54,894
O'BRIEN:
We'll have to reroute

255
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,647
the preignition plasma
from the impulse deck

256
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,899
down to the auxiliary intake
to generate that much power,

257
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,651
but I think we can do it.

258
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,236
Excellent.

259
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,779
We'll also need to
download our parameters

260
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,947
for the matrix into
one of your computers.

261
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,450
I think we'd better use
the main computer, Chief.

262
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,785
I don't think the Engineering
computer can handle it.

263
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,328
I agree.

264
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,914
If you'll follow me,
I'll take you up to the Bridge

265
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,583
and we can begin
downloading the data.

266
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,625
All right.

267
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,425
Everything looks good here.

268
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,301
Dax?

269
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,928
The backup navigation program

270
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,180
is still showing
some calibration drift.

271
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,849
I think some data
may have been lost

272
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,058
in the start-up routine.

273
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,560
Possibly.

274
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,856
Well... that explains
the seven percent falloff

275
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,858
in AFR ratios I keep seeing.

276
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,151
Must be a problem
in the diagnostic subroutines.

277
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,820
I have a recalibration
unit in my quarters

278
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,196
that might
solve the problem.

279
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,198
I'll have someone
bring it here.

280
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,950
Oh, no, no,
I need a break anyway.

281
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:55,037
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

282
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:03,588
Now I'm getting a drop-off
in the triple-R output.

283
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,256
We might have
a bigger problem

284
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,425
than the diagnostic
subroutines.

285
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,889
Don't panic yet.

286
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,307
It could just be
transtator failure.

287
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,558
It happens
all the time.

288
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,603
I wasn't panicking.

289
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:21,355
It's just
an expression.

290
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,690
Sorry.

291
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,692
No, I'm sorry.

292
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,320
(<i> chuckles</i> )

293
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,905
Forget it.

294
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:32,283
You know, it's just
that you always used to...

295
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,327
I mean,<i> Torias</i> always
used to tell Nilani

296
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,787
that she was panicking
about things,

297
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:38,164
making a big fuss
about nothing.

298
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,960
Well, Torias used to be
insensitive at times.

299
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,837
But you have to admit

300
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:47,256
Nilani did do her share
of overreacting.

301
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,800
That's because
you were a pilot,

302
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,719
and it made me nervous...
made<i> her</i> nervous.

303
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,807
Torias being a pilot
made Nilani nervous.

304
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,980
I've never had
quite this much trouble

305
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,358
sorting out my feelings
from those of a past host.

306
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,612
I know what you mean.

307
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,781
Probably another good reason

308
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,241
why we're not supposed
to spend much time together.

309
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:18,037
We'd probably just
get lost in the past.

310
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:33,887
Let's try running
the transtator diagnostic again.

311
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:36,222
Okay.

312
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:40,977
Nilani wasn't panicking
the day before Torias died.

313
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,478
No?

314
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,688
No.

315
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,315
Torias should have listened
to her.

316
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:51,779
The shuttle was not ready
for a full impulse test,

317
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,699
but Torias had to do it anyway.

318
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,494
And he was wrong,

319
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,873
and whatever part of me
is still Torias...

320
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,792
is very sorry...

321
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:08,922
and wishes he'd listened to you.

322
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,890
Well...

323
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,018
we have a lot of work to do.

324
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:24,979
Right.

325
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,648
Right.

326
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,701
Would you be interested
in dinner?

327
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,411
I mean,

328
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,914
I'm having dinner
with some friends,

329
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:46,042
and I thought
you might like to go along.

330
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:49,670
Oh, I-I wouldn't want
to intrude on your friends.

331
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,130
Actually, it's not

332
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,381
that big of a group.

333
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,342
It's just me and...

334
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,510
Julian.

335
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,013
Dr. Bashir?

336
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,768
Sure.

337
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,019
That sounds great.

338
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,772
Great.

339
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:08,856
Okay.

340
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,357
Dinner,

341
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,275
tonight.

342
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,359
At Quark's.

343
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,444
Great.

344
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:18,616
Tonight?

345
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,784
I can't.

346
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,201
I have plans.

347
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,829
Cancel them.

348
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:27,291
I mean, if you can cancel them,
that would be really nice.

349
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,334
Nice.

350
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,293
Yeah.

351
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,211
Because...?

352
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:34,674
Because I invited Lenara
out for dinner and...

353
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,343
And it would be less awkward
if you had a chaperon.

354
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,469
Exactly.

355
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:41,180
Will you do it?

356
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,724
Something tells me
that I should say no,

357
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,935
but you know I won't.

358
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:46,936
What time?

359
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,646
2200 at Quark's.

360
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,023
Thank you.

361
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,316
I owe you one.

362
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:03,369
No, it didn't have
a red awning.

363
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,914
It had a big<i> ratana</i> tree
or something out front.

364
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,875
Well, you don't mean
the Barros Inn?

365
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,376
Yes, that's it.

366
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,545
Curzon was kicked out
of the Barros Inn.

367
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,840
That's one of the wildest bars
in the whole Rigel system.

368
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,883
What did he do?

369
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:19,301
He sort of
set fire to it.

370
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,260
Sort of.

371
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,303
All right,
he set fire to it,

372
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,513
but it wasn't deliberate.

373
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:23,848
It was part of a bet.

374
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,767
But that's another story.

375
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,603
Curzon was certainly...

376
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,065
different from
most joined Trills.

377
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,441
Yeah, he liked to do things
his own way.

378
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:37,695
He used to say there was
an exception to every rule,

379
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:41,657
and he usually went
out of his way to find it.

380
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:45,119
I'm actually glad
we never met.

381
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,329
We probably wouldn't have
liked each other very much.

382
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,332
No, he wasn't
that bad, really.

383
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,043
I tend to exaggerate
his rebellious qualities.

384
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,586
But you may have

385
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,795
a point.

386
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,797
Curzon never had
much use for scientists.

387
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:01,427
Well, that's interesting,
considering what you do now.

388
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,804
Curzon would be horrified
to know that I'm a scientist.

389
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:08,726
Oh, the very idea
of doing research made him ill.

390
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:11,229
Torias wasn't
much different.

391
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:13,564
I can remember talking to him

392
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:17,818
about my wanting to study
theoretical quantum physics

393
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,362
and his eyes glazing over.

394
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,783
The irony is, you and I
have more in common

395
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,869
than Torias and Nilani ever did.

396
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,996
That's right.

397
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,456
MEDICAL OFFICER:
Infirmary to Dr. Bashir.

398
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,751
Um, Dr. Bashir here.
Go ahead.

399
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,294
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
Doctor,

400
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,713
but Ensign Tyler
has broken his leg and...

401
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,881
Oh, I'm on my way.

402
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,382
Um, I'm sorry.

403
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,884
Uh, I must go.

404
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,219
Duty calls.

405
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,428
That's all right.

406
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,638
Thanks for coming.

407
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,431
LENARA:
It was nice

408
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,557
to see you again.

409
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,188
Now, that's a good friend.

410
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,523
I mean,
he sat here all night,

411
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:59,568
listening to us trade stories
of our former hosts

412
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,403
and never once complained.

413
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,572
I think he enjoyed himself.

414
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,283
Mm-hmm.

415
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:06,784
Maybe not.

416
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,035
No.

417
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,787
(<i> both laughing</i> )

418
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,248
I'll make it up to him.

419
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,125
Yeah.

420
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,543
Those are Klingon, aren't they?

421
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:17,920
Yeah. How did you know?

422
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,213
Curzon.

423
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:20,298
They're beautiful.

424
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:21,715
Yeah.

425
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:25,928
They were given to me
by a, uh, Klingon scientist.

426
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,513
He wanted to give me
one of the swords

427
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,765
they carry around,
but I refused.

428
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,350
Keep them.

429
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,644
Really.

430
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:36,063
I'm not very Klingon.

431
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,400
Thanks.

432
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,527
Well?

433
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,988
They suit you.

434
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,620
It's really good
to see you again, Dax.

435
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,873
Oh, that sounds
so strange.

436
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,374
I mean, I'm looking
at a different face,

437
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:58,336
hearing a different voice...

438
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,422
but somehow it's still you.

439
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,799
I know.

440
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:07,970
Every time
I start to think of you

441
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:12,390
as just Lenara,
you'll smile, or laugh,

442
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,519
and suddenly it's you.

443
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,821
I'm<i> really</i> glad you're here.

444
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:29,950
Me, too.

445
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:48,510
WORF:
Defiant<i> Log, Stardate 49195.5.</i>

446
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,222
<i>Lieutenant Commander Worf</i>
<i>reporting.</i>

447
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:53,015
<i>We have arrived</i>
<i>at the coordinates</i>

448
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,516
<i>to begin preliminary tests</i>

449
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,895
<i>for the artificial</i>
<i>wormhole project.</i>

450
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:00,189
Target drone is in position,
Commander.

451
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:01,357
Full scan.

452
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,485
No ships in sensor range.

453
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,695
Bridge to
Engineering.

454
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,197
Are you ready, Mr. Eddington?

455
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:09,531
EDDINGTON:
We're ready, Commander.

456
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:13,077
Dr. Kahn... you may proceed.

457
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:15,037
Energize the focal array

458
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:18,456
and stand by to initiate
the subspace tensor matrix.

459
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,259
This AQF sequencer

460
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:30,719
is always causing
me problems.

461
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,805
Plasma coil interlocks
are in place.

462
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,933
Deflector grid is charged
and standing by.

463
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,768
They're very
friendly today.

464
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:39,312
Hmm?

465
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:41,563
They had dinner
last night... alone.

466
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,066
What are you
trying to say?

467
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:46,110
I shouldn't have
to<i> say</i> anything.

468
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,237
Then don't.

469
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:54,492
We're ready to generate
the tensor matrix.

470
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,578
The drone is standing by.

471
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:59,248
Initialize
the focal array.

472
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:06,130
BEJAL:
The tensor matrix is forming.

473
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:08,715
Activate the drone.

474
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,593
The drone is sending out
the magneton pulse.

475
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,053
It's reached the matrix.

476
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,680
I'm picking up
a subspace distortion.

477
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,889
BEJAL:
The distortion's

478
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:16,849
becoming coherent.

479
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,516
It's working.

480
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:19,643
DAX:
The magneton pulse

481
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,020
is causing a feedback loop.

482
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,813
It'll destroy the drone
in a few seconds.

483
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:25,649
A few seconds is all we need.

484
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:39,455
The drone's
been destroyed.

485
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:40,914
But you did it.

486
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,458
Congratulations, Doctor.

487
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,084
Thank you.

488
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,086
That was only the first step,

489
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,629
but what a step.

490
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,839
I'm so proud.

491
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,007
Thank you.

492
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,384
I'm so proud.

493
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:07,107
LENARA:
...the subspace field data,
the quantum readings--

494
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,901
all the telemetry
checks out.

495
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:12,446
The wormhole was
open 23.4 seconds,

496
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:14,323
and during that time,
it was completely coherent.

497
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,658
You couldn't ask
for a better beginning.

498
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,994
But it all comes down
to the next test.

499
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,663
We have to be able to send
an object through the wormhole

500
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,124
to prove that it's stable
for space travel.

501
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,376
Oh, that reminds me.

502
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:27,378
Dax thinks we should use
a class-4 probe

503
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:28,921
to make the actual run with.

504
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,672
She says that
the class-4 shielding

505
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,091
will give us a better idea

506
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,134
of how the wormhole
will affect a real ship.

507
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,845
I didn't know you'd talked
to Dax since we got back.

508
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,098
Yeah, I saw her last night.

509
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:40,640
Where?

510
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,310
She came by my quarters.

511
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,645
How long did she stay?

512
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,858
Is there something
you want to ask me?

513
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:53,153
I don't<i> want</i>
to ask you anything,

514
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:56,115
but I'm beginning to wonder
if I should.

515
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:02,288
I don't believe this.

516
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:03,956
Believe it.

517
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,958
People are starting to notice.

518
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,543
People?

519
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:09,962
Dr. Pren saw you holding hands
at dinner the other night.

520
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:11,046
I thought he was overreacting,

521
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,465
but then I saw the way

522
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,091
the two of you were acting
on the<i> Defiant.</i>

523
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,427
Lenara.

524
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,807
Lenara. Lenara.

525
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:27,729
I'm sorry.

526
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,358
I'm sorry.

527
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,113
Look, I'm your brother.

528
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:40,576
You tell me
nothing's going on...

529
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:43,120
then nothing's going on.

530
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,291
I just want
to hear you say it.

531
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,838
There is nothing
going on.

532
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:56,883
All right?

533
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,514
All right.

534
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,776
(<i> exhaling</i> )

535
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:25,287
(<i> door chimes</i> )

536
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,539
Come in.

537
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:32,628
(<i> sighs</i> )

538
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,171
What's wrong?

539
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:38,342
I just had the most
unpleasant conversation

540
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:41,053
with my brother.

541
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,055
He...

542
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:46,684
he thinks that there's something
going on between us.

543
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:49,269
Oh.

544
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,313
And what did you tell him?

545
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,148
Well, I told him
that that was ridiculous.

546
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,359
That there's nothing
going on between us.

547
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,818
That you and I are just friends.

548
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,904
Well, then,
that should settle that.

549
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,991
Maybe we shouldn't
see each other.

550
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,869
It'll just give people
the wrong idea.

551
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,539
Or give them the right idea.

552
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:16,463
I don't think we should have
this conversation.

553
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,632
Would it do any good?

554
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:21,843
Would it change
how either of us feels?

555
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:28,141
No.

556
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,768
But it would be easier.

557
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,979
You've never been one
for the easy way out.

558
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,315
That's true,
but in this case...

559
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,776
I'm not the only one involved.

560
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:53,542
I don't want to do
anything to hurt you.

561
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:56,295
I did that before.

562
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,671
I climbed into
a shuttlecraft,

563
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,172
and<i> I</i> made you a widow.

564
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,216
I knew you were a pilot
when I married you.

565
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,468
I knew the risks.

566
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:05,262
I went into it
with my eyes wide open.

567
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:07,222
And what about now?

568
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,475
Are your eyes open?

569
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:12,436
Do you know
what the risks are?

570
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,525
I thought I'd...

571
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,446
I thought I'd gotten over you.

572
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:28,577
It's been so long
and so much has happened.

573
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:33,791
And now I know I haven't.

574
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,507
Shh.

575
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:43,175
Shh, shh.

576
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,385
I've missed you.

577
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:48,930
I've missed you so much.

578
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,632
I'd better go.

579
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,677
Yeah.

580
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,619
DAX: I don't know
what to do, Benjamin.

581
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,830
What do you want to do?

582
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,624
Throw myself at her,

583
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,251
profess my undying love

584
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:02,504
and my complete disregard
for Trill society.

585
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:08,510
A joke Lenara made
at the reception.

586
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,512
It doesn't sound so funny
anymore, does it?

587
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:12,305
Not really.

588
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,473
You don't think

589
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,933
I should pursue this, do you?

590
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:18,729
No.

591
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:20,105
Okay.

592
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,899
Why?

593
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:26,695
Because I remember what Curzon
used to say about reassociation,

594
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:30,323
that it didn't matter whether
he agreed with the taboo or not,

595
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:33,368
because the price
for violating it was too high--

596
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,661
exile.

597
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,037
I know
what Curzon

598
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,624
used to say...
and I'm not Curzon.

599
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,459
And you're not
Torias either.

600
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:43,128
You're Jadzia Dax,

601
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:46,465
and you have a responsibility
as a joined Trill to never...

602
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,508
I didn't come here
to hear a lecture

603
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,885
about my responsibilities.

604
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,095
You came here
for advice from a friend,

605
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,556
and that's exactly
what you're getting.

606
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,225
You're right.

607
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,145
I'm sorry.

608
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,399
I know this is difficult
for you.

609
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,152
I know how you feel
about Lenara,

610
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:10,572
but I want you to think
about what will happen

611
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:12,658
if you pursue this.

612
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:15,744
If you're exiled from Trill,

613
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:18,371
there will be no further hosts

614
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,290
for your symbiont.

615
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,208
When Jadzia dies,

616
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,670
Dax dies.

617
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:29,215
That goes against
everything you were taught

618
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,176
during your
initiate training.

619
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:34,179
You've told me again and again

620
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:37,850
that each host
is only a link in a chain...

621
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,227
and that the life
of the symbiont,

622
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:44,731
no matter what happens,
must go on.

623
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,650
I know that...

624
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,820
and I believe in that.

625
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,281
But I also know...

626
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:58,119
I love her, Benjamin.

627
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,746
(<i> sighs</i> )

628
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,835
I know you do.

629
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:09,255
If I were in your position,

630
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:14,135
I'd probably be just as ready
to throw away<i> everything</i>

631
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,762
for the person I love.

632
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,431
But I would also
want to be sure

633
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:23,395
that I was ready
to pay the price.

634
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,397
You're right.

635
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,816
I need to be sure.

636
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,326
But if you're sure...

637
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,873
if this is what
you really want...

638
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:46,501
I will back you all the way.

639
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:54,509
I've lived seven lifetimes,

640
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:58,555
and I have never had
a friend quite like you.

641
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,569
Eddington to Bridge.

642
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,320
We're ready to generate
the tensor matrix.

643
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,405
Understood.
Stand by.

644
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:16,406
Aye, sir.

645
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:17,866
Commander Dax.

646
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:20,285
Subspace field stress is
within normal parameters.

647
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,037
Probe's ready to launch.

648
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:24,247
Target drone is in position.

649
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,291
Bridge to Engine Room.

650
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,376
Initialize subspace matrix,
Mr. Eddington.

651
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,211
WORF:
On my mark.

652
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,671
Acknowledged.

653
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,554
BEJAL:
The tensor matrix
is starting to form.

654
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,139
Activate the drone.

655
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,236
Wormhole neutrino readings
are stable.

656
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,781
Subspace field stress
is up by 15 percent,

657
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:59,741
but still within safety margins.

658
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,409
Launch the probe.

659
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:15,340
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

660
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,426
Report!

661
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,678
No helm control!

662
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,638
There's a hull breach
on deck five.

663
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,932
Emergency force fields
are in place.

664
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,183
I'm reading
a massive plasma leak

665
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,267
in the Engine Room.

666
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,728
WORF:
Bridge to
Engine Room!

667
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,022
Mr. Eddington!

668
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:32,231
Dr. Kahn, can you hear me?

669
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:36,736
Have a damage control team
meet me down there.

670
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,290
Stand back.

671
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,092
EDDINGTON:
It's out of control!

672
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:02,179
We can't put it
out with those!

673
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:05,724
We'll have to vent the entire
compartment out into space.

674
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:07,642
No! Lenara might
still be alive.

675
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,352
There's no way
to get to her.

676
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,604
How long will a level-A
force field last in here?

677
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,481
Not long with
that plasma fire.

678
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,108
Ten, 20 seconds
at most.

679
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:16,526
I think I can get to her.

680
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:18,028
Dax, if we don't
contain this thing now,

681
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:20,197
it's going
to set off the warp core.

682
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:22,199
I know,
just give me ten seconds

683
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,575
after the force field
goes off,

684
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:24,910
and then vent
the compartment.

685
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,495
I need to reconfigure
the field geometry.

686
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,039
I'll try to
keep the field

687
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:30,790
stable as long as I can.

688
00:37:56,649 --> 00:38:01,613

00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,714
Oh, Dax...

691
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,424
I thought I'd lost you.

692
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,301
Oh, so did I.

693
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,428
I don't want to lose you.

694
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,180
Not again.

695
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,598
Not again.

696
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:30,142
Never again.

697
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:32,602
Never again. Never.

698
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,450
(<i> door chimes</i> )

699
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,827
Come in.

700
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:52,956
How are you
feeling?

701
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:54,040
Much better.

702
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,750
She's almost
fully recovered.

703
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,627
My brother, the nurse.

704
00:38:57,627 --> 00:39:01,006
I want to thank you
for what you did.

705
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:04,550
Lenara means a lot to me.

706
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,344
To both of us.

707
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:10,932
Yes.

708
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,978
I'll leave you two alone.

709
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:28,366
Risian perfume.

710
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,833
Do they know what happened
to the wormhole yet?

711
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,127
Our best guess is
that the tetryon field

712
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:42,297
reacted to the probe's
shielding, producing a massive

713
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:43,673
graviton wave.

714
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:44,757
The important
thing is

715
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,134
no one got killed

716
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:48,928
and we brought the ship back
in one piece.

717
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:52,431
Oh, the ship--
how badly was it damaged?

718
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:53,975
Chief O'Brien says
he'll have it

719
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:55,727
good as new in two weeks.

720
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:59,105
Now stop
torturing yourself.

721
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,107
It wasn't your fault.

722
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,609
It was<i> my</i> project, my theories.

723
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,570
And you
shouldn't forget

724
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,988
that your project
and your theories

725
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,366
produced the first
artificially created

726
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:10,700
wormhole in history.

727
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,911
It's a huge
achievement.

728
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:14,954
You're right.

729
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,456
I am being
a little self-indulgent,

730
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,708
aren't I?

731
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,877
Yes, you are.

732
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:24,214
Well, I guess I'll have
a lot of work to do

733
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:25,590
when I get back to Trill.

734
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,176
Analyzing the telemetry
from the probe alone

735
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,178
will probably take months.

736
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:31,930
Probably.

737
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,853
Why not do the work
here with me?

738
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,066
With you.

739
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:48,029
The two of us together, you know
what that would mean.

740
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:50,698
I know exactly
what that would mean...

741
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,910
but I think
it's worth the price.

742
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,331
That's funny.

743
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:01,459
Bejal just spent
the last half hour

744
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,170
trying to convince me
that it wouldn't be worth it.

745
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:07,882
He wants me to go back to Trill
with him, tomorrow...

746
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,926
try to forget about you.

747
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:12,470
Well, at least he's consistent.

748
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,555
Don't be too hard on him.

749
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,642
He's only trying to look out
for his big sister.

750
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:22,897
Everyone is trying
to look out for us...

751
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,984
protect us from ourselves.

752
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,988
But in the end...

753
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,782
all that matters is how we feel

754
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,284
and what we
do about it,

755
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:35,994
because
either way,

756
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:38,955
we're the ones who have to live
with the consequences.

757
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:42,459
That's the tricky part, though,
isn't it?

758
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:45,044
Living with
the consequences.

759
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:48,047
When you're not with me,

760
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,508
when you're not around...

761
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,594
it's like a part of me
is missing.

762
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,972
I want to be with you
more than anything,

763
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:58,183
but I don't think
that I can do this.

764
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:01,894
Dax, I am not like you.

765
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,813
I don't have
a little Curzon inside me

766
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:06,858
telling me to be impulsive,
to ignore the rules,

767
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,567
to give up everything
that I've worked for.

768
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,279
Can you really walk away
from me?

769
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:12,280
From us?

770
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,656
After all this time,

771
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,908
we're together.

772
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:18,161
Don't throw that away.

773
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:20,621
I don't want to!

774
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:25,126
Maybe I need more time.

775
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:27,962
Maybe if I go back to Trill
for a while,

776
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,631
I-I'll think it over. I...

777
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,342
I can always come back later.

778
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:39,307
I wish I could believe you.

779
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:43,895
But ultimately it
comes down to this--

780
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:48,983
if you feel about me
the way I feel about you,

781
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:52,778
you won't go on that
transport tomorrow,

782
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:56,574
and if you do leave,
I think we both know...

783
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,745
you're never coming back again.

784
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:31,150
Good-bye, Commander.
Thank you.
