1
00:00:02,197 --> 00:00:04,167
Last time on
<i>Star Trek: Deep Space 9...</i>

2
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:15,048
I managed to save
the Dax symbiont.

3
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:16,526
There was...

4
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:18,930
nothing I could do for Jadzia.

5
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:33,961
Federation soldiers
have landed on Cardassian soil

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,939
and now you're telling me
the wormhole is gone?

7
00:00:36,972 --> 00:00:38,065
And with it, any chance

8
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:40,011
of getting reinforcements
from the Gamma Quadrant.

9
00:00:40,046 --> 00:00:42,483
The station's all yours, Major.

10
00:00:44,724 --> 00:00:46,888
Let's go home, Jake.

11
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:52,061
I need a First Officer
for a dangerous mission.

12
00:00:52,106 --> 00:00:53,803
How dangerous?

13
00:00:53,844 --> 00:00:57,147
Dangerous enough to assure
Jadzia a place in <i>Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

14
00:00:57,184 --> 00:00:58,619
I had a vision
from the Prophets.

15
00:00:58,653 --> 00:01:00,783
I was on Tyree in the desert

16
00:01:00,825 --> 00:01:02,226
and I uncovered a face...

17
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:03,822
the face of a woman.

18
00:01:03,866 --> 00:01:05,859
You had a wife before mama?

19
00:01:05,903 --> 00:01:07,896
Sarah was your mother.

20
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,138
You're to begin
an immediate evacuation.

21
00:01:10,179 --> 00:01:11,648
I'm afraid that's impossible.

22
00:01:11,682 --> 00:01:15,281
Either you remove
those weapons, or we will.

23
00:01:20,268 --> 00:01:21,703
Hello, Benjamin.

24
00:01:21,738 --> 00:01:23,731
Do I know you?

25
00:01:23,775 --> 00:01:27,476
It's me... Dax.

26
00:01:27,517 --> 00:01:30,318
And now, the continuation.

27
00:01:31,827 --> 00:01:33,626
Dax.

28
00:01:33,664 --> 00:01:35,395
I can't believe it.

29
00:01:35,434 --> 00:01:39,398
I can hardly believe it myself,
but I'm Dax.

30
00:01:39,443 --> 00:01:41,539
I mean, I'm not Jadzia Dax.

31
00:01:41,582 --> 00:01:42,709
I'm Ezri Dax.

32
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,948
But I have
all of Jadzia's memories...

33
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:48,292
not to mention Lela's,
Tobin's, Emony's, Audrid's

34
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,765
Joran's, Curzon's.

35
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,825
Am I forgetting anyone?

36
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:51,837
Torias?

37
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:53,238
Right, you're probably

38
00:01:53,274 --> 00:01:54,834
asking yourself,
"Who is this person?"

39
00:01:54,878 --> 00:01:56,245
"How did she get the symbiont?"

40
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,011
"Do I even want another Dax
in my life?"

41
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,519
"Does she always talk
this much?"

42
00:01:59,554 --> 00:02:01,387
These are all
very good questions.

43
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:03,589
And I wish I had good answers
for you.

44
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,963
The answers can wait.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,267
Right now, I'm just
glad to see you.

46
00:02:07,305 --> 00:02:08,740
Really?

47
00:02:08,774 --> 00:02:11,075
That is so nice of you to say.

48
00:02:13,685 --> 00:02:15,918
I'm not usually this emotional.

49
00:02:15,957 --> 00:02:17,859
It must be the Emony in me.

50
00:02:17,894 --> 00:02:20,331
At least, I think it's Emony.

51
00:02:20,366 --> 00:02:22,462
Hi, Jake.

52
00:02:22,505 --> 00:02:24,134
Hi.

53
00:02:24,175 --> 00:02:26,236
You seem taller.

54
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,181
Or am I shorter?

55
00:02:28,217 --> 00:02:31,349
Oh... You know, none
of this was my idea.

56
00:02:31,424 --> 00:02:33,053
I never wanted to be joined.

57
00:02:33,094 --> 00:02:35,190
Then how did you get
the symbiont?

58
00:02:35,232 --> 00:02:36,496
It was an accident.

59
00:02:36,536 --> 00:02:38,028
Some accident.

60
00:02:38,072 --> 00:02:39,507
I was on the <i>Destiny</i>
when they brought

61
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:42,013
the Dax symbiont aboard
to be taken back to Trill.

62
00:02:42,047 --> 00:02:43,072
Halfway through the trip

63
00:02:43,117 --> 00:02:44,746
the symbiont took
a turn for the worse

64
00:02:44,787 --> 00:02:47,020
and it needed to be placed
in a host immediately...

65
00:02:47,058 --> 00:02:48,652
And you were
the only Trill onboard.

66
00:02:48,695 --> 00:02:51,964
I laid down on that
operating table one person

67
00:02:52,003 --> 00:02:53,973
and I woke up
a completely different person.

68
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,035
Well, I should say
eight different people.

69
00:02:56,078 --> 00:02:58,549
I was not prepared for this
at all.

70
00:02:58,584 --> 00:03:00,247
I mean, you're supposed
to get years of training

71
00:03:00,287 --> 00:03:01,688
and preparation
before you get joined

72
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:03,284
and all I got was
a 15-minute lecture

73
00:03:03,328 --> 00:03:05,526
from the ship's surgeon,
and he wasn't even a Trill...

74
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:07,900
I'm starting to see the problem.
Please.

75
00:03:13,082 --> 00:03:14,551
You don't know
how much better I feel

76
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:15,849
just being here with you, Ben.

77
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:20,287
What about
the Symbiosis Institute?

78
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:22,267
Weren't they able
to do anything for you?

79
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:25,138
I did meet with the Evaluation
Board several times.

80
00:03:26,144 --> 00:03:27,545
And?

81
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:31,146
They gave me some books to read,
some counseling

82
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:33,387
but once a host
and symbiont are joined

83
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:35,762
there's really not very much
they can do.

84
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,566
My parents, my friends,
my crewmates...

85
00:03:38,605 --> 00:03:41,669
it's like they don't
even know me anymore

86
00:03:41,712 --> 00:03:45,483
which is understandable
since I hardly even know myself.

87
00:03:46,556 --> 00:03:49,392
That's why I took
a leave of absence to come here.

88
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,561
I knew that if there was anyone
who could help me through this

89
00:03:52,603 --> 00:03:53,832
it would be you.

90
00:03:53,872 --> 00:03:55,842
I'll do all I can

91
00:03:55,877 --> 00:03:57,471
but the truth is...

92
00:03:57,547 --> 00:04:01,180
we're leaving for Tyree.

93
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:04,786
Fine.
I'll come with you.

94
00:04:06,032 --> 00:04:08,560
Uh, you don't even
know why we're going.

95
00:04:08,604 --> 00:04:10,437
It doesn't matter.

96
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,809
When do we leave?

97
00:04:12,847 --> 00:04:13,974
Today.

98
00:04:14,016 --> 00:04:15,610
Great.

99
00:04:15,653 --> 00:04:17,817
It'll be just like old times...

100
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,919
except different.

101
00:06:22,025 --> 00:06:28,164
<i>Jadzia Dax Vond Shoo-vwee Dun</i>
<i>maHh-kekh Huh-Qoo-vaHm</i>

102
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:30,836
<i>jeh yin-moj maH-mukh.</i>

103
00:06:30,878 --> 00:06:36,083
<i>Sto-Vo-Kor paH-dahkh-tin</i>
<i>baht'leH</i>

104
00:06:36,123 --> 00:06:39,358
<i>el-eegh-cha yay-moj.</i>

105
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,497
Quark, son of Keldar.

106
00:06:45,444 --> 00:06:46,571
Did I come at a bad time?

107
00:06:46,612 --> 00:06:48,172
What's he doing here?

108
00:06:48,216 --> 00:06:49,845
Same thing you are.

109
00:06:49,886 --> 00:06:52,790
I'm volunteering
for this mission.

110
00:06:52,827 --> 00:06:54,228
Why?

111
00:06:54,263 --> 00:06:56,233
You're a bartender,
not a warrior.

112
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:59,604
True. But I loved Jadzia

113
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:01,805
as much as anyone
in this room...

114
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:04,943
with maybe one or two exceptions

115
00:07:04,986 --> 00:07:07,549
and I am willing
to pledge my life

116
00:07:07,592 --> 00:07:10,997
to see that she gets
into <i>Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

117
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:15,304
Perhaps there is some
Klingon in you after all.

118
00:07:15,343 --> 00:07:17,439
I wouldn't go that far.

119
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,247
So, uh, why all the cutlery?

120
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:26,126
We shed our blood to prove
we are not frightened of death.

121
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,068
Can't you just take
my word for it?

122
00:07:30,776 --> 00:07:34,181
Ow! That hurts.

123
00:07:34,217 --> 00:07:35,481
It's supposed to hurt.

124
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,253
Oh!

125
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:40,262
<i>YuWee-modge.</i>

126
00:07:40,331 --> 00:07:42,802
<i>Baht'leH-modge.</i>

127
00:07:44,205 --> 00:07:45,469
<i>Yay-dodge.</i>

128
00:07:57,068 --> 00:07:58,537
This is so embarrassing.

129
00:07:58,571 --> 00:07:59,539
Well, don't worry.

130
00:07:59,573 --> 00:08:00,940
It's not your fault.

131
00:08:00,976 --> 00:08:03,174
I am a trained
Starfleet Officer.

132
00:08:03,214 --> 00:08:05,685
I have no business
getting spacesick.

133
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,351
But ever since I was
given the symbiont

134
00:08:08,392 --> 00:08:11,091
warp speed does make
me a little queasy.

135
00:08:11,132 --> 00:08:12,259
A little queasy?

136
00:08:12,301 --> 00:08:13,793
Well, the main thing is

137
00:08:13,838 --> 00:08:15,808
the control panel's
all cleaned up.

138
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:17,869
So if one of you'd
like to get back

139
00:08:17,913 --> 00:08:19,280
into the pilot's seat

140
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:22,049
it would sure make me
feel better...

141
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:25,028
not that I don't trust
the computer.

142
00:08:25,062 --> 00:08:27,228
You just prefer the human touch.

143
00:08:27,361 --> 00:08:28,990
Do you need to lie down?

144
00:08:29,032 --> 00:08:30,626
No. I'm fine, really.

145
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:32,571
Hmm. Well...

146
00:08:32,606 --> 00:08:34,200
it's time for my nap.

147
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,949
You sure you're okay?

148
00:08:38,987 --> 00:08:40,752
Mm-hmm, but I just wish

149
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,354
I could stop thinking
about Torias.

150
00:08:43,396 --> 00:08:44,557
Torias Dax?

151
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:46,900
He was one of the previous
hosts, wasn't he?

152
00:08:46,938 --> 00:08:48,771
He died in the shuttle accident.

153
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:49,868
I still remember

154
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:52,041
the last few seconds
before the crash.

155
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:55,648
Maybe I don't belong
in Starfleet anymore.

156
00:08:58,597 --> 00:09:02,093
Aren't you glad
you brought me along?

157
00:09:09,253 --> 00:09:11,486
Actually, I am.

158
00:09:11,525 --> 00:09:15,796
My dad seems a lot happier
ever since you showed up.

159
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:17,098
One iced <i>raktajino.</i>

160
00:09:17,171 --> 00:09:20,542
I know you've been worried
about your father, Jake

161
00:09:20,578 --> 00:09:22,708
but he's going to be all right.

162
00:09:22,749 --> 00:09:24,116
What makes you so sure?

163
00:09:24,219 --> 00:09:26,690
Because I've known
him for a long time.

164
00:09:26,725 --> 00:09:29,356
Besides, it's my job
to know these things.

165
00:09:29,397 --> 00:09:30,661
I'm a Ship's Counselor.

166
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,035
Well, actually,
an Assistant Ship's Counselor.

167
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,131
You're a therapist?

168
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,509
Is it that surprising?

169
00:09:36,547 --> 00:09:38,745
A little.

170
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:41,552
You know, I wasn't
always this confused.

171
00:09:41,591 --> 00:09:43,618
Before I was joined

172
00:09:43,663 --> 00:09:46,362
I was considered to be
a very promising young officer.

173
00:09:48,941 --> 00:09:52,005
Oh, that is horrible.

174
00:09:52,048 --> 00:09:53,016
I hate <i>raktajino.</i>

175
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,417
Then why'd you order it?

176
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:57,619
Because Curzon liked it.

177
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:59,288
Hmm. So did Jadzia.

178
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,095
Well, I don't.

179
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:04,698
I have to learn to control
some of these urges.

180
00:10:04,742 --> 00:10:05,801
Oh.

181
00:10:05,844 --> 00:10:06,937
Uh...

182
00:10:11,055 --> 00:10:13,925
I want you to know, Colonel
that I'm as outraged as you are.

183
00:10:13,962 --> 00:10:16,092
The Romulans have no business
placing weapons on Derna.

184
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:17,226
I'm glad we're in agreement.

185
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,637
What are we going
to do about it?

186
00:10:18,673 --> 00:10:19,868
The Federation has already sent

187
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:21,401
a formal protest
to the Romulan Senate

188
00:10:21,445 --> 00:10:22,846
condemning their actions.

189
00:10:22,882 --> 00:10:24,749
Well, that's a start.
What happens next?

190
00:10:24,786 --> 00:10:28,248
Well, they've already sent
a protest of our protest.

191
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:29,420
Politics.

192
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,455
Well, you still haven't
answered my question.

193
00:10:32,469 --> 00:10:33,768
I don't know, Colonel.

194
00:10:33,806 --> 00:10:35,742
Eventually, the Romulans
will remove the weapons.

195
00:10:35,777 --> 00:10:36,767
When?

196
00:10:36,812 --> 00:10:39,443
Are we talking about days,
weeks, months?

197
00:10:39,484 --> 00:10:41,283
I don't know,
but it will happen.

198
00:10:41,323 --> 00:10:43,760
Now you sound
like a politician, Admiral.

199
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:48,994
Maybe so, but facts are facts,
Colonel, and there's no way

200
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:51,203
the Bajorans can drive
the Romulans off Derna...

201
00:10:51,244 --> 00:10:52,508
not without help, anyway

202
00:10:52,547 --> 00:10:55,417
and the Federation isn't going
to provide that help, not now.

203
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:56,649
Is that clear?

204
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:57,988
We're just not as important

205
00:10:58,026 --> 00:10:59,620
to the war effort
as the Romulans.

206
00:10:59,663 --> 00:11:02,066
That's a harsh way to put it.

207
00:11:02,102 --> 00:11:04,129
The truth often is.

208
00:11:04,172 --> 00:11:05,265
Colonel, I would
like to help you

209
00:11:05,308 --> 00:11:06,276
but my hands are tied.

210
00:11:06,311 --> 00:11:10,082
Well, luckily, mine aren't.

211
00:11:11,489 --> 00:11:12,582
Meaning what?

212
00:11:12,624 --> 00:11:14,891
Our scans show
that the weapons aren't

213
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:16,296
fully operational yet.

214
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,132
They're still missing
launch sequencers.

215
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,195
I'm going to make sure

216
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:21,141
that those sequencers
never reach Derna.

217
00:11:21,176 --> 00:11:22,144
How?

218
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:23,306
I'm going to set up a blockade.

219
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:24,941
If you do that, Colonel

220
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:27,320
you'll have a fight
on your hands...

221
00:11:27,424 --> 00:11:30,225
a fight you can't win.

222
00:11:48,804 --> 00:11:51,275
We're entering orbit.
Prepare to beam down.

223
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,146
Why don't we use the ship's
scanners to find the Orb?

224
00:11:54,182 --> 00:11:56,619
There's too much ionization
in the atmosphere.

225
00:11:56,654 --> 00:11:58,385
It'll interfere
with our sensors.

226
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:01,989
You sure you don't want
to stay here and wait for us?

227
00:12:02,032 --> 00:12:03,797
And miss all the excitement?

228
00:12:03,837 --> 00:12:05,136
Not a chance.

229
00:12:05,173 --> 00:12:07,974
Well, be sure you're carrying
plenty of water packs.

230
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:09,710
That goes for both of you, too.

231
00:12:11,052 --> 00:12:12,453
It's dry down there.

232
00:12:12,489 --> 00:12:15,017
<i>Dr. Wykoff, please report</i>
<i>to Isolation Ward 4.</i>

233
00:12:15,061 --> 00:12:20,266
<i>Dr. Wykoff, please</i>
<i>report to Isolation Ward 4.</i>

234
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:21,832
Did you hear that?

235
00:12:21,876 --> 00:12:23,972
Hear what?

236
00:12:26,754 --> 00:12:28,417
Forget it.

237
00:12:39,381 --> 00:12:41,408
If there is an Orb buried
around here

238
00:12:41,486 --> 00:12:43,285
my tricorder's
not picking it up.

239
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:46,763
I know it's out there someplace.

240
00:12:46,798 --> 00:12:49,737
That's why the Prophets
sent me here.

241
00:12:49,771 --> 00:12:53,267
Did they give you any hint
which way to go?

242
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,176
That way.

243
00:12:58,724 --> 00:13:00,284
The Prophets have spoken.

244
00:13:00,327 --> 00:13:01,990
I hope he heard them right.

245
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:30,452
Once we're close enough

246
00:13:30,527 --> 00:13:32,019
we can fire an EM
pulse at the sun.

247
00:13:32,064 --> 00:13:33,123
The sun?

248
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:34,864
I thought we were trying
to destroy a shipyard.

249
00:13:34,904 --> 00:13:36,305
We are.

250
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,809
Do you understand
what he's talking about?

251
00:13:37,843 --> 00:13:38,811
Always.

252
00:13:38,845 --> 00:13:40,576
Fine. Then you explain it.

253
00:13:40,616 --> 00:13:42,712
We are going to fly toward
the molten heart of the sun

254
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:46,593
so close that our ship will glow
like a flaming comet.

255
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:48,964
Well, hopefully not that close.

256
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:52,134
Just close enough to trigger
a solar plasma ejection.

257
00:13:52,174 --> 00:13:54,475
The explosion should be enough
to incinerate everything

258
00:13:54,513 --> 00:13:56,005
within a hundred
million kilometers.

259
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,317
Including the shipyard.

260
00:13:58,355 --> 00:14:00,291
It will be a glorious firestorm

261
00:14:00,326 --> 00:14:01,294
that will illuminate

262
00:14:01,328 --> 00:14:03,822
the gates of <i>Sto-Vo-Kor</i>
itself, and provide

263
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:05,666
a fitting welcome for Jadzia.

264
00:14:05,705 --> 00:14:07,972
The things we do for love.

265
00:14:13,288 --> 00:14:14,689
Did you see that?

266
00:14:15,927 --> 00:14:17,226
See what?

267
00:14:17,263 --> 00:14:18,755
The way he glared at me.

268
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,995
He always glares at you.

269
00:14:20,036 --> 00:14:21,265
Well, I'm sick of it.

270
00:14:21,305 --> 00:14:22,500
We're risking our lives

271
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:24,512
to help Jadzia
get into <i>Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

272
00:14:24,546 --> 00:14:28,817
The very least Worf could do
is show us some appreciation.

273
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:32,021
Is it so hard to say thank you?

274
00:14:32,062 --> 00:14:33,395
Thank you.

275
00:14:33,432 --> 00:14:34,400
Nice try, Doctor

276
00:14:34,434 --> 00:14:36,199
but I want to hear it from him.

277
00:14:36,238 --> 00:14:38,071
Don't do this, Quark.

278
00:14:38,109 --> 00:14:39,338
Do what?

279
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,043
All I'm asking for
is two little words.

280
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,854
Be quiet!

281
00:14:45,893 --> 00:14:47,522
That's two words, all right

282
00:14:47,563 --> 00:14:49,328
just not the two
I was hoping for.

283
00:14:51,606 --> 00:14:54,510
Why should I feel
any gratitude towards you?

284
00:14:54,545 --> 00:14:56,914
I owe you nothing.

285
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,009
You are not here

286
00:14:58,052 --> 00:15:00,421
to help Jadzia
get into <i>Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

287
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,431
You are here because you wish
to convince yourselves

288
00:15:03,465 --> 00:15:05,025
that you are worthy of her

289
00:15:05,068 --> 00:15:07,061
but the truth is, none of you

290
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,370
could ever hope
to be worthy of her

291
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:11,040
or even understand
the kind of woman she was.

292
00:15:15,257 --> 00:15:18,662
It is you who should be
thanking me, Ferengi

293
00:15:18,698 --> 00:15:20,965
for allowing you
to come on this mission

294
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,404
and pay honor to her memory.

295
00:15:30,277 --> 00:15:31,404
Think we're getting close?

296
00:15:31,445 --> 00:15:32,846
I have no idea.

297
00:15:32,882 --> 00:15:35,012
But we're headed
in the right direction?

298
00:15:35,054 --> 00:15:36,421
I hope so.

299
00:15:36,456 --> 00:15:39,019
Audrid loved to walk.

300
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,965
Of course, she
preferred the woods...

301
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,303
nice shady glens, cool
breezes, cold streams.

302
00:15:44,341 --> 00:15:45,867
Dax, what are you trying to say?

303
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:48,678
You've been keeping
a pretty fast pace.

304
00:15:48,717 --> 00:15:49,742
It might be a good idea

305
00:15:49,786 --> 00:15:51,585
to give your father and Jake
a chance to rest.

306
00:15:51,624 --> 00:15:53,059
If anyone wants to take a break

307
00:15:53,093 --> 00:15:54,528
they can go back
to the runabout.

308
00:15:54,563 --> 00:15:56,396
I think we should
stick together.

309
00:15:56,434 --> 00:15:58,962
Hey, Dad!

310
00:15:59,006 --> 00:16:00,133
How you doing back there?

311
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:01,611
Never better.

312
00:16:16,846 --> 00:16:18,179
It's only a matter of time

313
00:16:18,215 --> 00:16:19,616
until we break through
enemy lines

314
00:16:19,651 --> 00:16:21,484
and when that happens

315
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,959
we can drive
the Federation-Romulan alliance

316
00:16:23,994 --> 00:16:26,021
out of Cardassian territory.

317
00:16:27,503 --> 00:16:29,097
A bit more <i>kanar?</i>

318
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,632
Please.

319
00:16:32,814 --> 00:16:34,716
To victory...

320
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:37,689
on all fronts.

321
00:16:39,896 --> 00:16:41,263
Damar, have you...

322
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:43,532
Weyoun.

323
00:16:43,571 --> 00:16:45,838
This is Siana.

324
00:16:45,876 --> 00:16:49,681
We met at the dinner last night
honoring Legate Hovas.

325
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:53,920
Damar, you and I have things
to discuss...

326
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,024
things that your guest
doesn't want to hear.

327
00:16:57,067 --> 00:16:59,094
And why is that?

328
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:02,944
Because if she does, I'll be
forced to have her executed.

329
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,976
I really should be going.

330
00:17:07,691 --> 00:17:09,388
Until tonight.

331
00:17:15,774 --> 00:17:18,713
What a pleasant woman.

332
00:17:18,748 --> 00:17:20,081
Now.

333
00:17:21,153 --> 00:17:22,622
It's imperative

334
00:17:22,657 --> 00:17:25,458
we increase production
at the Monac shipyard.

335
00:17:25,496 --> 00:17:28,765
We need more assault ships
to retake

336
00:17:28,803 --> 00:17:29,793
the Chin'toka system.

337
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:32,608
Damar

338
00:17:32,646 --> 00:17:34,115
are you listening to me?

339
00:17:36,353 --> 00:17:37,286
Increase production.

340
00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:38,448
Yes, I heard you.

341
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,018
By how much?

342
00:17:40,062 --> 00:17:42,966
15 percent would be ideal.

343
00:17:43,001 --> 00:17:43,991
That won't be easy.

344
00:17:44,037 --> 00:17:45,631
Oh, I'm sure you'll find a way.

345
00:17:45,674 --> 00:17:46,938
You're very resourceful.

346
00:17:55,729 --> 00:17:57,460
A blockade?

347
00:17:57,499 --> 00:18:00,232
How many ships are
we talking about?

348
00:18:00,273 --> 00:18:01,572
12 impulse ships.

349
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:03,135
It's all the Council
of Ministers

350
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:04,204
could spare right now.

351
00:18:04,248 --> 00:18:05,740
And how effective do you think

352
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,447
those 12 ships are going to be

353
00:18:07,488 --> 00:18:10,221
against even one
Romulan warbird?

354
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:11,787
You sound like Admiral Ross.

355
00:18:11,832 --> 00:18:14,930
Well, I was hoping
that our relationship

356
00:18:14,971 --> 00:18:16,964
was going to be
a long and happy one

357
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,536
but I suppose
I'm willing to settle

358
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,277
for short and exciting.

359
00:18:20,317 --> 00:18:21,809
What's that supposed to mean?

360
00:18:21,854 --> 00:18:25,294
I take it you're going to be
commanding the blockade?

361
00:18:25,328 --> 00:18:26,318
That's right.

362
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:27,991
Then I'm going
to be there with you.

363
00:18:28,034 --> 00:18:30,335
You don't have to do that.

364
00:18:30,372 --> 00:18:32,502
Yes, I do.

365
00:18:37,989 --> 00:18:41,554
Well, I wouldn't start writing
our epitaphs just yet.

366
00:18:41,596 --> 00:18:45,537
All right, I'll wait until
the first wave of Romulan ships

367
00:18:45,572 --> 00:18:47,041
decide to run the blockade.

368
00:18:47,076 --> 00:18:48,340
Don't worry.

369
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:50,371
I have no intention
of getting into a firefight

370
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:53,149
with a squadron
of Romulan warbirds.

371
00:18:53,189 --> 00:18:55,091
You mean you're bluffing?

372
00:18:55,127 --> 00:18:57,894
If the Romulans fire on us

373
00:18:57,933 --> 00:19:00,427
they jeopardize their alliance
with the Federation

374
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,565
and I'm hoping

375
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,874
that that's a risk
they don't want to take.

376
00:19:03,912 --> 00:19:08,855
And I'm hoping they
don't call your bluff.

377
00:19:28,432 --> 00:19:30,299
Grandpa, you sure
you don't want to go

378
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,498
back up to the runabout?

379
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:36,073
We started this together
and we'll finish it together.

380
00:19:36,117 --> 00:19:38,850
I owe it to Ben.

381
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,489
I got you.

382
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:53,609
Let's go.

383
00:20:58,297 --> 00:21:02,864
<i>Doctor Wykoff, please come to</i>
<i>Isolation Ward 4 immediately...</i>

384
00:21:02,907 --> 00:21:06,244
<i>to Isolation Ward 4,</i>
<i>Doctor Wykoff.</i>

385
00:21:06,281 --> 00:21:07,944
<i>Doctor Wykoff, please come</i>

386
00:21:07,985 --> 00:21:10,422
<i>to Isolation Ward 4
<i>immediately.</i>

387
00:21:10,457 --> 00:21:11,584
Benjamin.

388
00:21:12,628 --> 00:21:14,963
Benjamin, is this it?

389
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,526
I think so.

390
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,062
You're not sure?

391
00:21:18,107 --> 00:21:20,203
Ben, that's not good enough.

392
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:23,612
Ben.

393
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,635
Are you listening to me?

394
00:21:36,448 --> 00:21:38,077
There.

395
00:21:38,118 --> 00:21:39,245
Where?

396
00:21:40,323 --> 00:21:41,792
That's where
we start digging.

397
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,441
Why there?

398
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:52,004
I wasn't even
aiming at anything.

399
00:21:54,554 --> 00:21:57,253
Ben, maybe my memories
are playing tricks on me

400
00:21:57,293 --> 00:21:58,956
but have you gotten stranger?

401
00:22:04,308 --> 00:22:08,272
Ship's Log, Stardate 52152.6.

402
00:22:08,317 --> 00:22:10,344
We've set up a blockade
around Derna.

403
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:13,556
So far, no Romulan ships
have tried to challenge it.

404
00:22:13,595 --> 00:22:15,565
"Kiss Me Deadly."

405
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,568
Interesting title.

406
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:18,037
Mmm. The book isn't bad, either.

407
00:22:18,072 --> 00:22:20,008
I think you'll enjoy it.

408
00:22:20,043 --> 00:22:21,444
I'm sure I will,
but is this really

409
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,143
the right time
to start reading a book?

410
00:22:23,184 --> 00:22:25,451
Well, maybe not,
but I know how much

411
00:22:25,489 --> 00:22:26,753
you hate all this waiting

412
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:29,262
and Mike Hammer
has certain qualities

413
00:22:29,297 --> 00:22:30,458
I think you'll appreciate.

414
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,468
Hmm...

415
00:22:31,502 --> 00:22:32,663
such as?

416
00:22:32,771 --> 00:22:34,365
He's as tough as they come

417
00:22:34,408 --> 00:22:37,073
and he hates waiting
almost as much as you do.

418
00:22:37,114 --> 00:22:38,241
Oh, I like him already.

419
00:22:38,283 --> 00:22:39,410
Hmm...

420
00:22:39,452 --> 00:22:40,262
Colonel, there's a priority one
transmission from Deep Space 9.

421
00:22:40,262 --> 00:22:42,232
Colonel, there's a priority one
transmission from Deep Space 9.

422
00:22:42,267 --> 00:22:43,736
It's Admiral Ross.

423
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:46,139
Put him through.

424
00:22:46,175 --> 00:22:48,703
Colonel, Senator Cretak
has just informed me

425
00:22:48,748 --> 00:22:51,549
that 14 Romulan warbirds
are on their way to Derna.

426
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:52,886
They'll be arriving
in eight hours

427
00:22:52,924 --> 00:22:54,188
with much-needed
medical supplies

428
00:22:54,226 --> 00:22:55,559
for the hospital complex.

429
00:22:55,596 --> 00:22:58,500
Since when did the Romulans
start using warbirds

430
00:22:58,535 --> 00:23:00,402
to deliver medical supplies?

431
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,137
We want to make sure
they arrive safely.

432
00:23:02,177 --> 00:23:04,238
Well, if they try
to get through the blockade

433
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:05,682
they're not going
to make it at all.

434
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,688
That kind of talk isn't going
to help matters, Colonel.

435
00:23:07,722 --> 00:23:08,690
I'd think you'd want

436
00:23:08,724 --> 00:23:10,854
to avoid a confrontation,
not provoke one.

437
00:23:10,896 --> 00:23:11,989
Well, I wouldn't call

438
00:23:12,031 --> 00:23:14,001
those Romulan ships
a peace offering.

439
00:23:14,036 --> 00:23:16,803
Well, I wasn't exactly happy
to hear about that, either...

440
00:23:16,842 --> 00:23:18,471
but we only have a few hours

441
00:23:18,513 --> 00:23:20,483
to reach some sort
of compromise.

442
00:23:20,518 --> 00:23:22,648
After that, people are
going to start dying.

443
00:23:22,688 --> 00:23:25,718
Well, you can talk about
compromise all you want.

444
00:23:25,762 --> 00:23:28,997
Any ship attempting to
break through that blockade

445
00:23:29,036 --> 00:23:31,269
will be fired upon.

446
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:32,469
Colonel

447
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,569
do you seriously believe

448
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,673
that your antiquated
collection of impulse ships

449
00:23:35,717 --> 00:23:38,518
stands a chance
against our warbirds?

450
00:23:39,525 --> 00:23:41,723
We'll find out soon
enough, won't we?

451
00:23:41,764 --> 00:23:43,427
End transmission.

452
00:23:47,042 --> 00:23:48,636
How'd I do?

453
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:51,344
Mike Hammer
would have been proud.

454
00:23:52,921 --> 00:23:54,652
You're concerned.

455
00:23:55,795 --> 00:23:57,128
Aren't you?

456
00:23:57,165 --> 00:23:59,226
Not really.

457
00:23:59,269 --> 00:24:03,768
The Colonel is a brave woman,
but she's not stupid.

458
00:24:04,915 --> 00:24:06,350
She's bluffing.

459
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,564
Right over there.

460
00:24:15,605 --> 00:24:16,595
Shade.

461
00:24:26,829 --> 00:24:27,819
Here.

462
00:24:27,865 --> 00:24:29,026
Oh.

463
00:24:32,107 --> 00:24:33,770
There you go, Grandpa.

464
00:24:38,355 --> 00:24:41,726
<i>Dr. Wykoff, please come</i>
<i>to Isolation Ward 4.</i>

465
00:24:41,762 --> 00:24:44,233
<i>Dr. Wykoff</i>
<i>to Isolation Ward 4.</i>

466
00:24:44,268 --> 00:24:45,532
I wish he'd get there.

467
00:24:45,571 --> 00:24:46,972
Who?

468
00:24:47,007 --> 00:24:48,202
Dr. Wykoff.

469
00:24:48,243 --> 00:24:50,407
They're waiting for him
in the Isolation Ward.

470
00:24:51,484 --> 00:24:53,317
You have definitely
gotten stranger.

471
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:58,689
What about me, Worf?

472
00:24:58,733 --> 00:25:01,296
Would you rather I hadn't
come on this mission, either?

473
00:25:01,338 --> 00:25:03,240
That is not what I am saying.

474
00:25:03,276 --> 00:25:04,575
With you, it is different.

475
00:25:04,612 --> 00:25:08,177
You are a Klingon and Jadzia
was a member of your House.

476
00:25:08,221 --> 00:25:10,590
And these men were her friends.

477
00:25:10,626 --> 00:25:12,255
They honor her
with their presence.

478
00:25:12,296 --> 00:25:13,286
I don't believe it...

479
00:25:13,332 --> 00:25:14,391
<i>gagh</i> for breakfast

480
00:25:14,434 --> 00:25:16,701
<i>gagh</i> for lunch,
<i>gagh</i> for dinner...

481
00:25:16,739 --> 00:25:18,174
Am I the only one who thinks

482
00:25:18,209 --> 00:25:20,305
Klingon menus need
to have more variety?

483
00:25:20,347 --> 00:25:22,010
You want to complain
about their <i>gagh</i>

484
00:25:22,051 --> 00:25:23,246
that's fine with me

485
00:25:23,287 --> 00:25:25,417
but don't complain about it
when we're in the mess hall

486
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:27,588
sitting at a table surrounded
by a dozen Klingons.

487
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,190
All right, all right,
I get the point.

488
00:25:29,233 --> 00:25:30,201
Good.

489
00:25:30,235 --> 00:25:31,203
But I'm telling you

490
00:25:31,237 --> 00:25:32,797
I think some of those Klingons
agreed with me.

491
00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:35,404
Look, uh, Worf,
if this has anything to do

492
00:25:35,447 --> 00:25:37,007
with what just happened
in the mess hall...

493
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,109
No. No, it does not.

494
00:25:38,153 --> 00:25:39,121
What's the matter?

495
00:25:39,155 --> 00:25:41,319
Come up with a few more insults
to throw at us?

496
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,493
I wish to apologize.

497
00:25:44,567 --> 00:25:46,503
I'm listening.

498
00:25:46,605 --> 00:25:49,270
I know Jadzia meant
a great deal to all of you

499
00:25:49,311 --> 00:25:51,178
and you meant
a great deal to her.

500
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:54,051
Many times, when we
discussed our day

501
00:25:54,088 --> 00:25:55,648
she would repeat
something amusing

502
00:25:55,692 --> 00:25:57,389
that you had told her

503
00:25:57,429 --> 00:25:59,957
or describe, in endless details

504
00:26:00,001 --> 00:26:02,997
the intricacies
of some new scheme of yours.

505
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,307
She often talked
about all of you.

506
00:26:06,949 --> 00:26:10,480
It seemed as though,
even when we were alone

507
00:26:10,524 --> 00:26:13,291
one of you was always with us.

508
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,731
I get it.

509
00:26:14,766 --> 00:26:15,825
You were jealous

510
00:26:15,869 --> 00:26:17,338
because she liked us
better than you.

511
00:26:17,373 --> 00:26:20,835
Quark, would you please
keep quiet.

512
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,115
She was my wife, my <i>par'machkai.</i>

513
00:26:24,154 --> 00:26:28,425
I did not like having
to share her affections.

514
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:29,932
Oh, that's
why you didn't want us

515
00:26:29,967 --> 00:26:31,128
on this mission with you.

516
00:26:32,138 --> 00:26:33,299
You wanted to get her

517
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,208
into <i>Sto-Vo-Kor</i>
without our help.

518
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,216
I wanted it
to be my gift to her.

519
00:26:43,997 --> 00:26:45,124
Go on.

520
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:49,734
There is nothing more to say.

521
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:52,943
Except that I am
pleased you're here.

522
00:26:58,028 --> 00:27:01,092
I have never heard Worf
apologize to anyone.

523
00:27:01,135 --> 00:27:04,802
I don't know about you,
but I was hoping for something

524
00:27:04,843 --> 00:27:07,542
a little more... intriguing.

525
00:27:07,616 --> 00:27:09,051
Such as?

526
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:11,683
You know, like... Jadzia used

527
00:27:11,725 --> 00:27:15,894
to call my name out
when she slept, or...

528
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:18,406
wanted to name
her first child after me.

529
00:27:20,411 --> 00:27:21,846
Chief...

530
00:27:21,881 --> 00:27:24,911
the Monac shipyard.

531
00:27:29,966 --> 00:27:32,096
Impressive.

532
00:27:32,136 --> 00:27:34,369
Display our target.

533
00:27:37,649 --> 00:27:41,020
How close do we have
to get to that?

534
00:27:42,392 --> 00:27:44,362
Too close.

535
00:27:44,397 --> 00:27:45,558
Perfect.

536
00:28:00,232 --> 00:28:01,200
What is it, Dad?

537
00:28:01,234 --> 00:28:02,361
Have you found something?

538
00:28:03,406 --> 00:28:05,137
Stay back.

539
00:28:07,982 --> 00:28:09,849
The Orb of the Emissary.

540
00:28:14,396 --> 00:28:15,695
What are you going to do?

541
00:28:17,637 --> 00:28:18,798
Open it.

542
00:28:19,941 --> 00:28:21,467
Mr. Russell...

543
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:28,051
Mr. Russell, put it down.

544
00:28:28,093 --> 00:28:29,061
Benjamin

545
00:28:29,095 --> 00:28:30,564
what's wrong?

546
00:28:30,598 --> 00:28:31,862
Benjamin.

547
00:28:31,901 --> 00:28:34,338
I said put down the pencil.

548
00:28:37,948 --> 00:28:39,884
Put it down, Mr. Russell.

549
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,891
But I-I haven't finished
my story yet.

550
00:28:42,925 --> 00:28:44,485
Captain Sisko has found

551
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:46,431
the Orb of the Emissary...

552
00:28:48,838 --> 00:28:51,036
but he hasn't opened it yet.

553
00:28:56,355 --> 00:28:59,886
Mr. Russell, you promised
not to write on the walls.

554
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:01,592
No one will give me any paper.

555
00:29:02,903 --> 00:29:04,098
I thought we agreed

556
00:29:04,138 --> 00:29:06,005
that you weren't going
to write at all...

557
00:29:06,043 --> 00:29:07,512
that you needed to rest.

558
00:29:07,547 --> 00:29:08,674
No, I don't need to rest.

559
00:29:08,715 --> 00:29:11,016
I need to tell my stories.

560
00:29:11,054 --> 00:29:14,118
You were doing so well, Benny...
making real progress.

561
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,493
We were all so proud of you.

562
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,363
I-I need to go home.

563
00:29:17,401 --> 00:29:18,630
I don't belong here.

564
00:29:18,671 --> 00:29:20,470
And we're going to send you
home, as soon as you're well.

565
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:21,476
I'm fine.

566
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,478
But you're not fine.

567
00:29:22,512 --> 00:29:24,710
People who are fine
don't write on walls.

568
00:29:24,784 --> 00:29:26,515
Then get me a typewriter.

569
00:29:26,554 --> 00:29:27,544
You're not listening.

570
00:29:27,591 --> 00:29:29,185
The stories have
got to stop, Benny.

571
00:29:29,228 --> 00:29:30,321
They are too dangerous.

572
00:29:30,363 --> 00:29:32,333
But too dangerous to whom?

573
00:29:32,367 --> 00:29:33,494
To you.

574
00:29:33,537 --> 00:29:37,945
This world you've created,
this... Deep Space 9

575
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,747
Captain Sisko and Kira
and the others...

576
00:29:40,785 --> 00:29:42,084
none of it is real.

577
00:29:42,122 --> 00:29:43,716
Oh, it is to me.

578
00:29:45,229 --> 00:29:48,760
If I don't...
finish my story...

579
00:29:48,837 --> 00:29:52,333
if... if Captain Sisko
doesn't open the Orb box

580
00:29:52,378 --> 00:29:55,043
then he cannot contact
the Prophets.

581
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,054
It doesn't matter, Benny.

582
00:29:57,088 --> 00:29:59,389
The Prophets don't exist.

583
00:29:59,427 --> 00:30:01,694
They're all figments
of your imagination.

584
00:30:01,731 --> 00:30:03,257
Get rid of them.

585
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,101
It's the only way
that you're going to get well.

586
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,236
Now, give me the pencil, Benny.

587
00:30:07,277 --> 00:30:08,438
But my story...

588
00:30:09,749 --> 00:30:11,184
It's over.

589
00:30:11,219 --> 00:30:13,155
Just let it go.

590
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,158
Benjamin

591
00:30:14,192 --> 00:30:15,991
what are you waiting for?

592
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,998
Open it.

593
00:30:17,032 --> 00:30:18,159
That's why we're here, right?

594
00:30:18,201 --> 00:30:20,672
He can't hear you.

595
00:30:26,175 --> 00:30:27,143
Jake!

596
00:30:31,653 --> 00:30:33,714
Jake... are you all right?

597
00:30:33,758 --> 00:30:34,783
Yeah.

598
00:30:34,827 --> 00:30:37,298
Ship's Log, supplemental.

599
00:30:37,332 --> 00:30:39,997
Senator Cretak said
that the Romulan warbirds

600
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,598
would be here in eight hours.

601
00:30:41,641 --> 00:30:43,270
She was wrong.

602
00:30:43,312 --> 00:30:44,781
They're two hours early.

603
00:30:45,851 --> 00:30:47,878
They'll be in weapons
range in eight minutes.

604
00:30:47,922 --> 00:30:49,117
Open a channel.

605
00:30:49,158 --> 00:30:50,650
Go ahead.

606
00:30:51,663 --> 00:30:54,134
This is Colonel Kira
of the Bajoran Militia.

607
00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:57,108
Any ship traveling within
transporter range of Derna

608
00:30:57,143 --> 00:31:00,082
will be considered hostile
and fired upon.

609
00:31:05,694 --> 00:31:07,186
They're not responding.

610
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:12,072
Kira to all Bajoran ships.
Prepare to engage.

611
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:14,512
Sir, Admiral Ross
is asking to speak to you.

612
00:31:14,548 --> 00:31:15,675
Put him through.

613
00:31:15,716 --> 00:31:17,983
Colonel, I'm appealing to you

614
00:31:18,022 --> 00:31:19,651
one last time
to end this blockade.

615
00:31:19,692 --> 00:31:21,525
Well, you know
I can't do that, Admiral.

616
00:31:21,563 --> 00:31:22,724
Be aware

617
00:31:22,766 --> 00:31:25,033
that I'm authorized to use
whatever force is necessary

618
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:28,373
to see that our medical supplies
reach their destination.

619
00:31:28,411 --> 00:31:32,716
However, I'm also
authorized to seek

620
00:31:32,754 --> 00:31:34,246
a negotiated settlement.

621
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:37,695
My government has made
its position quite clear.

622
00:31:37,732 --> 00:31:39,531
There are to be no negotiations

623
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:42,473
as long as there are
Romulan weapons on Derna.

624
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:43,738
Damn it, Colonel.

625
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:45,805
If you open fire on those
ships, we all lose.

626
00:31:45,849 --> 00:31:47,078
The only way
to beat the Dominion

627
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:48,816
is to keep our alliance intact.

628
00:31:48,856 --> 00:31:52,296
Besides... I would hate to see
you throw your life away.

629
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,460
Your concern is touching,
Senator...

630
00:31:58,343 --> 00:32:00,245
but I'm not dead yet.

631
00:32:00,282 --> 00:32:01,911
End transmission.

632
00:32:07,463 --> 00:32:11,096
At least not for
another six minutes.

633
00:32:14,813 --> 00:32:16,578
You still think she's
going to back down?

634
00:32:16,617 --> 00:32:18,587
She has to...

635
00:32:18,622 --> 00:32:21,116
because I won't.

636
00:32:29,546 --> 00:32:32,313
Take me out of the oven, Moogie.

637
00:32:32,352 --> 00:32:34,288
I'm cooked.

638
00:32:34,322 --> 00:32:35,621
General, I found it...

639
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:37,525
a magnetic instability
near the sun's equator.

640
00:32:37,563 --> 00:32:39,089
Excellent.
Now, let's trigger

641
00:32:39,133 --> 00:32:41,297
that solar ejection
and get out of here.

642
00:32:41,338 --> 00:32:42,739
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

643
00:32:42,775 --> 00:32:43,765
We have to make sure

644
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,837
the ejection has
the right trajectory

645
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:46,974
to destroy the shipyard.

646
00:32:47,018 --> 00:32:48,510
Well, how do we do that?!

647
00:32:48,553 --> 00:32:50,786
We have to get closer...
much closer.

648
00:32:50,825 --> 00:32:51,952
He's right.

649
00:32:54,934 --> 00:32:56,528
<i>Sto-Vo-Kor...</i>

650
00:32:56,571 --> 00:32:58,598
here we come.

651
00:33:02,051 --> 00:33:03,486
Take it, Benny.

652
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,285
What for?

653
00:33:05,325 --> 00:33:08,195
I'm offering you an opportunity
few people ever get.

654
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,360
You can wipe away
all your mistakes.

655
00:33:10,402 --> 00:33:13,033
You want me
to paint over my story?

656
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:14,408
They're only words.

657
00:33:16,014 --> 00:33:18,451
Meaningless words
that no one cares about.

658
00:33:18,486 --> 00:33:20,650
Get rid of them

659
00:33:20,725 --> 00:33:22,490
and you can walk out
of here a free man.

660
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:27,503
Go ahead.

661
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:28,940
Save yourself.

662
00:33:42,038 --> 00:33:43,028
Ben?

663
00:33:43,074 --> 00:33:44,407
I've got to cover it up;
bury it.

664
00:33:44,443 --> 00:33:46,072
Ben, what are you doing?

665
00:33:57,138 --> 00:33:59,268
It's for your own good, Benny.

666
00:33:59,309 --> 00:34:01,576
Wipe away the words.

667
00:34:01,614 --> 00:34:03,915
Destroy them before
they destroy you.

668
00:34:08,831 --> 00:34:10,664
Ben, stop!

669
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:23,895
The Romulans have
powered their weapons.

670
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:26,424
I think they're
calling your bluff.

671
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:28,872
Auxiliary power
to forward shields.

672
00:34:28,908 --> 00:34:31,573
Kira to all ships.
Hold your positions.

673
00:34:31,614 --> 00:34:35,988
Nerys, if you're going to end
this, I suggest you do it now.

674
00:34:39,698 --> 00:34:41,965
Time to fold, Colonel.

675
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:50,283
Oh, damn it.

676
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:52,291
We're ready, General.

677
00:34:55,165 --> 00:34:58,900
De-cloak and prepare to fire...

678
00:34:58,941 --> 00:35:00,604
on Worf's command.

679
00:35:13,372 --> 00:35:14,807
Fire!

680
00:35:28,505 --> 00:35:30,999
It didn't work.

681
00:35:31,044 --> 00:35:32,809
Oh, well, we tried.

682
00:35:32,848 --> 00:35:34,818
Time to go.

683
00:35:34,886 --> 00:35:37,619
No! Not until we complete
our mission.

684
00:35:37,659 --> 00:35:39,288
We'll have to increase
the magnetic gradient.

685
00:35:39,329 --> 00:35:41,493
I'll recalibrate the deflector.

686
00:35:41,534 --> 00:35:42,695
We might not have time.

687
00:35:42,736 --> 00:35:44,433
There are three Jem'Hadar ships
approaching.

688
00:35:44,473 --> 00:35:48,414
Bearing 005 mark 190.

689
00:35:48,449 --> 00:35:51,285
I suggest
you work quickly, Chief.

690
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:01,202
No!

691
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:03,544
Get out of my way.

692
00:36:03,582 --> 00:36:06,817
Ben, you came here to find
the Prophets, remember?

693
00:36:06,923 --> 00:36:07,982
Move!

694
00:36:08,026 --> 00:36:09,325
No, listen to me!

695
00:36:09,361 --> 00:36:11,958
You promised Jadzia
you would make things right.

696
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,195
Well, now is your chance.

697
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:15,036
Open the box, Ben.

698
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:23,456
No!

699
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:11,022
Colonel...

700
00:37:11,064 --> 00:37:13,091
do we stand down?

701
00:37:13,135 --> 00:37:15,800
Sir, we're getting
a transmission

702
00:37:15,841 --> 00:37:17,333
from Deep Space 9.

703
00:37:17,378 --> 00:37:20,545
The wormhole... it's back.

704
00:37:20,584 --> 00:37:22,247
On screen.

705
00:37:28,728 --> 00:37:30,459
Nerys?

706
00:37:36,044 --> 00:37:38,743
Open a channel
to all Bajoran ships.

707
00:37:39,752 --> 00:37:40,879
Hold your positions

708
00:37:40,922 --> 00:37:42,949
and prepare to fire
on my command.

709
00:37:42,992 --> 00:37:44,221
Lock targets.

710
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,230
Targets locked.

711
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:46,528
Still glad you came along?

712
00:37:46,568 --> 00:37:48,538
I wouldn't have missed it
for anything.

713
00:37:48,572 --> 00:37:52,604
I'm afraid the Colonel
has run out of time.

714
00:38:03,204 --> 00:38:06,371
Well, Worf, did I not promise
you a glorious battle?

715
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,380
It is everything I hoped for.

716
00:38:09,919 --> 00:38:12,117
EM pulse ready, General.

717
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,220
What are you waiting for?

718
00:38:15,264 --> 00:38:16,232
Fire!

719
00:38:16,266 --> 00:38:18,362
By all means, Chief, fire!

720
00:38:26,756 --> 00:38:27,746
It's working!

721
00:38:27,791 --> 00:38:30,992
Great. Now, can we leave?

722
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,131
Full impulse.

723
00:38:57,924 --> 00:38:59,484
<i>Qapla'!</i>

724
00:39:01,098 --> 00:39:03,592
I hope Jadzia
appreciates all this.

725
00:39:03,636 --> 00:39:05,128
I'm sure she does.

726
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:12,583
<i>Lohm-Ict'liHj...</i>

727
00:39:12,623 --> 00:39:15,493
<i>posh-machh-Lodge</i>

728
00:39:15,529 --> 00:39:18,000
<i>Sto-Vo-Kor...</i>

729
00:39:18,035 --> 00:39:21,202
<i>Jadzia Dax...</i>

730
00:39:21,242 --> 00:39:25,775
<i>pay-Lodge pah-doQ-lih Dun.</i>

731
00:39:25,819 --> 00:39:32,357
<i>Shoo-vweee-vahm</i>
<i>baht'leH pay-Lodge.</i>

732
00:39:32,399 --> 00:39:40,908
<i>Pay-Lodge poh'hoqH-vahd</i>
<i>Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

733
00:39:52,143 --> 00:39:55,275
Nerys, they're pulling back.

734
00:39:55,317 --> 00:39:59,190
Colonel, Admiral Ross
would like to speak with you.

735
00:39:59,226 --> 00:40:00,353
Put him through.

736
00:40:01,698 --> 00:40:04,101
You can blink now, Colonel.

737
00:40:04,137 --> 00:40:05,264
You've won.

738
00:40:05,305 --> 00:40:06,466
Senator Cretak has agreed

739
00:40:06,508 --> 00:40:08,171
to remove the weapons
from Derna.

740
00:40:08,211 --> 00:40:09,874
What changed her mind?

741
00:40:09,915 --> 00:40:13,514
I told her, if she didn't
remove them, I would.

742
00:40:13,557 --> 00:40:15,322
Then what changed your mind?

743
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:18,056
You did.

744
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,594
Remind me never to play poker
with you.

745
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:35,906
Show yourselves.

746
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,807
I've come to speak with you.

747
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,316
The Sisko
has completed his task.

748
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:00,188
Sarah?

749
00:41:02,798 --> 00:41:05,771
The Kosst Amojan
no longer threatens us.

750
00:41:05,804 --> 00:41:07,569
You mean the Pah-wraith?

751
00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:09,135
It's no longer in the wormhole?

752
00:41:09,178 --> 00:41:10,807
I have cast it out.

753
00:41:10,883 --> 00:41:13,947
Is that why the Prophets
sent me to Tyree...

754
00:41:13,989 --> 00:41:16,426
to release you from the Orb?

755
00:41:16,461 --> 00:41:20,402
The Kosst Amojan tried
to stop you with a false vision

756
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:22,840
but you did not waver.

757
00:41:22,876 --> 00:41:26,145
You fulfilled your destiny.

758
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:28,016
My destiny?

759
00:41:28,054 --> 00:41:30,389
You talk as if my life was over.

760
00:41:30,426 --> 00:41:34,333
The Sisko
must still face many tasks.

761
00:41:36,072 --> 00:41:38,737
I don't suppose
you'll tell me what they are.

762
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,345
The Emissary is corporeal...

763
00:41:43,387 --> 00:41:44,446
linear.

764
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:47,861
Linear or not,
I need some answers.

765
00:41:47,897 --> 00:41:50,733
The Sisko is intrusive.

766
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:52,467
Are you Sarah Sisko?

767
00:41:52,507 --> 00:41:54,136
Are you my mother?

768
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:59,052
Sarah Sisko was corporeal.

769
00:41:59,088 --> 00:42:02,961
For a time,
I shared her existence.

770
00:42:02,997 --> 00:42:05,366
You took over her body...

771
00:42:05,403 --> 00:42:09,606
made sure
she married my father...

772
00:42:09,645 --> 00:42:14,019
so that she'd give birth to me.

773
00:42:14,054 --> 00:42:16,855
The Sisko is necessary.

774
00:42:16,895 --> 00:42:19,993
And once you didn't need
her anymore, you left her.

775
00:42:20,034 --> 00:42:23,667
No wonder she walked
out on my father.

776
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:27,240
She didn't choose him, you did.

777
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:32,025
The Sisko would prefer
different answers.

778
00:42:32,061 --> 00:42:34,760
What you're telling me
isn't easy to accept.

779
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,633
You arranged my birth.

780
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:39,108
I exist because of you?

781
00:42:39,143 --> 00:42:42,708
The Sisko's path
is a difficult one.

782
00:42:42,751 --> 00:42:44,220
But why me?!

783
00:42:44,254 --> 00:42:47,659
Why did it have to be me?

784
00:42:47,696 --> 00:42:51,797
Because it could be no one else.

785
00:43:02,862 --> 00:43:04,195
Benjamin?

786
00:43:07,105 --> 00:43:10,101
That must have been
some Orb experience.

787
00:43:10,144 --> 00:43:12,513
I'll tell you about it someday.

788
00:43:20,234 --> 00:43:21,726
Bravo.

789
00:43:23,206 --> 00:43:25,039
Emissary, welcome.

790
00:43:31,325 --> 00:43:33,626
Welcome back, Captain.

791
00:43:33,663 --> 00:43:34,653
We missed you, sir.

792
00:43:34,699 --> 00:43:36,396
Thank you for bringing
the Prophets back to us.

793
00:43:36,436 --> 00:43:39,237
I heard you've all been
pretty busy yourselves.

794
00:43:42,582 --> 00:43:46,523
Odo! Nerys, Julian,
it's so good to see you.

795
00:43:46,558 --> 00:43:48,357
Worf, we need to talk.

796
00:43:48,395 --> 00:43:49,488
Who's that?

797
00:43:49,531 --> 00:43:50,499
That's Dax.

798
00:43:50,533 --> 00:43:51,626
Dax?

799
00:43:51,669 --> 00:43:53,605
That's right. Ezri Dax.

800
00:43:53,641 --> 00:43:55,338
Incredible, isn't it?

801
00:43:55,378 --> 00:43:56,904
It cannot be.

802
00:43:56,948 --> 00:43:59,647
She's so much... shorter.

803
00:43:59,687 --> 00:44:01,350
Just when you thought

804
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:04,056
things couldn't get
more interesting.
