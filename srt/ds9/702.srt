1
00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:04,171
<i>Last time on</i>
Star Trek: Deep Space 9...

2
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:08,968
(<i> gasping</i> )

3
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:14,807
I managed to save
the Dax symbiont.

4
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:16,141
There was...

5
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,727
nothing I could
do for Jadzia.

6
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,659
Federation soldiers
have landed on Cardassian soil

7
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:36,620
and now you're telling me
the wormhole is<i> gone?</i>

8
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,623
And with it, any chance
of getting reinforcements
from the Gamma Quadrant.

9
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:42,041
The station's
all yours, Major.

10
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,547
Let's go home, Jake.

11
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:49,216
(<i> grunting</i> )

12
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,677
I need a First Officer
for a dangerous mission.

13
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,387
How dangerous?

14
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,724
Dangerous enough to assure
Jadzia a place in<i> Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

15
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:58,141
I had a vision
from the Prophets.

16
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,394
<i>I was on Tyree in the desert</i>

17
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,812
<i>and I uncovered a face...</i>

18
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,522
<i>the face of a woman.</i>

19
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,524
You had a wife before mama?

20
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:07,526
Sarah<i> was</i> your mother.

21
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,695
You're to begin
an immediate evacuation.

22
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,279
I'm afraid that's impossible.

23
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:14,992
Either you remove
those weapons, or we will.

24
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:21,331
Hello, Benjamin.

25
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,375
Do I know you?

26
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:27,086
It's me... Dax.

27
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:30,131
<i>And now, the continuation.</i>

28
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,176
Dax.

29
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,929
I can't believe it.

30
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:38,933
I can hardly believe it myself,
but I'm Dax.

31
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,893
I mean, I'm not Jadzia Dax.

32
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,227
I'm Ezri Dax.

33
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,479
But I have
all of Jadzia's memories--

34
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,025
not to mention Lela's,
Tobin's, Emony's, Audrid's,

35
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,401
Joran's, Curzon's.

36
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,485
Am I forgetting anyone?

37
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,445
Torias?

38
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,780
Right, you're probably

39
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,364
asking yourself,
"Who is this person?"

40
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,741
"How did she get the symbiont?"

41
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,451
"Do I even want another Dax
in my life?"

42
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,827
"Does she always talk
this much?"

43
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,704
These are all
very good questions.

44
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,998
And I wish I had good answers
for you.

45
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,416
The answers
can wait.

46
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,877
Right now, I'm just
glad to see you.

47
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,462
Really?

48
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,631
That is so nice of you to say.

49
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,385
I'm not usually this emotional.

50
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,262
It must be the Emony in me.

51
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,807
At least, I think it's Emony.

52
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,142
Hi, Jake.

53
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,685
Hi.

54
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,813
You seem taller.

55
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,689
Or am I shorter?

56
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,609
Oh... You know, none
of this was my idea.

57
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,527
I never wanted
to be joined.

58
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,696
Then how did you get
the symbiont?

59
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,031
It was an accident.

60
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,532
Some accident.

61
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,159
I was on the<i> Destiny</i>
when they brought

62
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,369
the Dax symbiont aboard
to be taken back
to Trill.

63
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:44,123
Halfway through
the trip the symbiont
took a turn for the worse,

64
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:46,541
and it needed to be placed
in a host immediately--

65
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,085
And you were
the only Trill onboard.

66
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:51,421
I laid down on that
operating table one person

67
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,465
and I woke up
a completely different person.

68
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,550
Well, I should say
eight different people.

69
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,928
I was not prepared for this
at all.

70
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,805
I mean, you're supposed
to get years of training

71
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,056
and preparation
before you get joined,

72
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,850
and all I got was
a 15-minute lecture

73
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,977
from the ship's surgeon,
and he wasn't even a Trill--

74
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:07,479
I'm starting to see the problem.
Please.

75
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,861
You don't know
how much better I feel

76
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,445
just being here with you, Ben.

77
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:19,867
What about
the Symbiosis Institute?

78
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,660
Weren't they able
to do anything for you?

79
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,621
I did meet with the Evaluation
Board several times.

80
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,041
And?

81
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:30,752
They gave me some books to read,
some counseling,

82
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,921
but once a host
and symbiont are joined

83
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,215
there's really not very much
they can do.

84
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,843
My parents, my friends,
my crewmates--

85
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:41,138
it's like they don't
even know me anymore,

86
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:44,725
which is understandable
since I hardly even know myself.

87
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:48,979
That's why I took
a leave of absence to come here.

88
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,899
I knew that if there was anyone
who could help me through this

89
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,233
it would be you.

90
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,194
I'll do all I can...

91
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,988
but the truth is...

92
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,615
we're leaving for Tyree.

93
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:05,245
Fine.
I'll come with you.

94
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,956
Uh, you don't even
know why we're going.

95
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,000
It doesn't matter.

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,293
When do we leave?

97
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,420
Today.

98
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,963
Great.

99
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,216
It'll be just like old times...

100
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:19,426
except different.

106
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,157
Did I come
at a bad time?

107
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,783
What's he doing here?

108
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,493
Same thing you are.

109
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,538
I'm volunteering
for this mission.

110
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,789
Why?

111
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,125
You're a bartender,
not a warrior.

112
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,212
True.
But I loved Jadzia

113
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:02,256
as much as anyone
in this room...

114
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,466
with maybe one
or two exceptions,

115
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,969
and I am willing
to pledge my life

116
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,722
to see that she gets
into<i> Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

(<i> grunts</i> )

118
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:15,852
Perhaps there<i> is</i> some
Klingon in you after all.

119
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,146
I wouldn't go
that far.

120
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,857
So, uh, why
all the cutlery?

121
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,735
We shed our blood to prove

122
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,613
we are not frightened
of death.

123
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,656
Can't you just take
my word for it?

124
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,783
(<i> growls</i> )

125
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,704
Ow! That hurts.

126
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,039
It's supposed to hurt.

127
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,792
Oh!

131
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,979
This is so
embarrassing.

132
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,356
Well, don't worry.
It's not your fault.

133
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,691
I am a trained
Starfleet Officer.

134
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,403
I have no business
getting spacesick.

135
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,822
But ever since I was
given the symbiont,

136
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,366
warp speed does make
me a little queasy.

137
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,826
A<i> little</i> queasy?

138
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,119
Well, the main thing is

139
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,330
the control panel's
all cleaned up.

140
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,707
So if one of you'd
like to get back
into the pilot's seat,

141
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,461
it would sure make me
feel better...

142
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:25,422
not that I don't trust
the computer.

143
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,882
JAKE:
You just prefer
the human touch.

144
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,592
Do you need
to lie down?

145
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,303
No. I'm fine, really.

146
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:34,931
Hmm. Well...
it's time for my nap.

147
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,560
You sure you're okay?

148
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,771
Mm-hmm, but I just wish

149
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,815
I could stop thinking
about Torias.

150
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:47,486
Torias Dax?
He was one of the previous
hosts, wasn't he?

151
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:50,030
He died in
a shuttle accident.

152
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,699
I still remember
the last few seconds
before the crash.

153
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,701
Maybe I don't belong

154
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,453
in Starfleet anymore.

155
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:02,792
Aren't you glad
you brought me along?

156
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,177
Actually,<i> I</i> am.

157
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:15,472
My dad seems a lot happier
ever since you showed up.

158
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,599
One iced<i> raktajino.</i>

159
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,977
I know you've been worried
about your father, Jake,

160
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,271
but he's going
to be all right.

161
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,772
What makes you so sure?

162
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:27,275
Because I've known
him for a long time.

163
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,486
Besides, it's my job
to know these things.

164
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,154
I'm a Ship's Counselor.

165
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,281
Well, actually,
an Assistant
Ship's Counselor.

166
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,741
You're a therapist?

167
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,077
Is it that surprising?

168
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,246
A little.

169
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:42,165
You know, I wasn't
always this confused.

170
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,125
Before I was joined,

171
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,920
I was considered to be
a very promising young officer.

172
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52,092
Oh, that is horrible.

173
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,593
I hate<i> raktajino.</i>

174
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,095
Then why'd you order it?

175
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,014
Because Curzon liked it.

176
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,849
Hmm. So did Jadzia.

177
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,310
Well, I don't.

178
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,397
I have to learn
to control some of
these urges.

179
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,566
Oh.
Ugh.

180
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:14,531
I want you to know,
Colonel, that I'm as
outraged as you are.

181
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,533
The Romulans have
no business placing
weapons on Derna.

182
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,784
I'm glad
we're in agreement.

183
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,286
What are we going
to do about it?

184
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,579
The Federation
has already sent

185
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:21,996
a formal protest
to the Romulan Senate

186
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,457
condemning their actions.

187
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,292
Well, that's a start.
What happens next?

188
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:28,420
Well, they've already sent
a protest of<i> our</i> protest.

189
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,837
Politics.

190
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,090
Well, you still haven't
answered my question.

191
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,426
I don't know, Colonel.

192
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,428
Eventually, the Romulans
will remove the weapons.

193
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:37,678
When?

194
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,847
Are we talking about days,
weeks, months?

195
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,682
I don't know,
but it<i> will</i> happen.

196
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,144
Now<i> you</i> sound
like a politician, Admiral.

197
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:49,357
Maybe so, but facts are facts,
Colonel, and there's no way

198
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,192
the Bajorans can drive
the Romulans off Derna--

199
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,111
not without help, anyway,

200
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,822
and the Federation isn't going
to provide that help, not now.

201
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,115
Is that clear?

202
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,533
We're just not as important

203
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,076
to the war effort
as the Romulans.

204
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,537
That's a harsh way to put it.

205
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,581
The truth often is.

206
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,625
Colonel, I would
like to help you,
but my hands are tied.

207
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:10,420
Well, luckily, mine aren't.

208
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,256
Meaning what?

209
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:16,675
Our scans show
that the weapons aren't
fully operational yet.

210
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,512
They're still missing
launch sequencers.

211
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:21,431
I'm going to make sure
that those sequencers
never reach Derna.

212
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,557
How?

213
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:23,891
I'm going to set up
a blockade.

214
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,477
If you do that, Colonel,

215
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:28,104
you'll have a fight
on your hands...

216
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,731
a fight you can't win.

217
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,628
We're entering orbit.
Prepare to beam down.

218
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,464
Why don't we use the ship's
scanners to find the Orb?

219
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,883
There's too much ionization
in the atmosphere.

220
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,801
It'll interfere
with our sensors.

221
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,472
You sure you don't want
to stay here and wait for us?

222
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,517
And miss all
the excitement?
Not a chance.

223
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:08,603
Well, be sure you're carrying
plenty of water packs.

224
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,605
That goes for both
of you, too.

225
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,607
It's dry down there.

226
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:15,652
VOICE:<i> Dr. Wykoff, please</i>
<i>report</i> <i> to Isolation Ward 4.</i>

227
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:20,699
<i>Dr. Wykoff, please</i> <i> report</i>
<i>to Isolation Ward 4.</i>

228
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,325
Did you hear that?

229
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,452
Hear what?

230
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,416
Forget it.

231
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,760
If there<i> is</i> an Orb
buried around here,

232
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,598
my tricorder's
not picking it up.

233
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:47,141
I know it's out
there someplace.

234
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,228
That's why the
Prophets sent me here.

235
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:53,690
Did they give you any hint
which way to go?

236
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,027
That way.

237
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,153
(<i> sighs</i> )

238
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,572
The Prophets
have spoken.

239
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,657
I hope he heard
them right.

240
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,686
Once we're close enough,
we can fire an EM
pulse at the sun.

241
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,062
The sun?

242
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,731
I thought we were trying
to destroy a shipyard.

243
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,232
We are.

244
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,692
Do you understand
what he's talking about?

245
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:38,652
Always.

246
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,737
Fine. Then
you explain it.

247
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,905
We are going to fly toward
the molten heart of the sun,

248
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:46,825
so close that our ship will glow
like a flaming comet.

249
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,827
Well, hopefully
not<i> that</i> close.

250
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:52,290
Just close enough
to trigger a solar
plasma ejection.

251
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,668
The explosion should be enough
to incinerate everything

252
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,127
within a hundred
million kilometers.

253
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,546
Including the shipyard.

254
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,423
It will be a glorious firestorm

255
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:04,010
that will illuminate
the gates of<i> Sto-Vo-Kor</i>
itself, and provide

256
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,762
a fitting welcome for Jadzia.

257
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,264
The things we
do for love.

258
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,854
Did you see that?

259
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,231
See what?

260
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,692
The way he
glared at me.

261
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:19,942
He always
glares at you.

262
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,444
Well, I'm sick of it.

263
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:22,821
We're risking our lives

264
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:24,614
to help Jadzia
get into<i> Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

265
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:28,909
The very least Worf could do
is show us some appreciation.

266
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,205
Is it so hard to say thank you?

267
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,748
Thank you.

268
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:36,334
Nice try, Doctor,
but I want to hear
it from him.

269
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,252
Don't do this, Quark.

270
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,462
Do what?

271
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:42,507
All I'm asking for
is two little words.

272
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:45,885
Be quiet!

273
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,554
That's two words,
all right,

274
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,556
just not the two
I was hoping for.

275
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:54,644
Why should I feel
any gratitude towards you?

276
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,937
I owe you nothing.

277
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,189
You are not here

278
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,525
to help Jadzia
get into<i> Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

279
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,695
You are here because you wish
to convince yourselves

280
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,154
that you are worthy of her

281
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,865
but the truth
is, none of you

282
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:08,408
could ever hope to
be worthy of her

283
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,285
or even understand
the kind of woman she was.

284
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,835
It is you who should be
thanking me, Ferengi,

285
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,961
for allowing you
to come on this mission

286
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,505
and pay honor to her memory.

287
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,806
Think we're
getting close?

288
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,182
I have no idea.

289
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,560
But we're headed
in the right direction?

290
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,729
I hope so.

291
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,397
Audrid loved to walk.

292
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,649
Of course, she
preferred the woods--

293
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,652
nice shady glens, cool
breezes, cold streams.

294
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,237
Dax, what are you
trying to say?

295
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,989
You've been keeping
a pretty fast pace.

296
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,910
It might be a good idea
to give your father and Jake
a chance to rest.

297
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,494
If anyone wants
to take a break,

298
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,913
they can go back
to the runabout.

299
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,873
I think we should
stick together.

300
00:15:56,873 --> 00:16:00,627
Hey, Dad!
How you doing
back there?

301
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,253
Never better.

302
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,004
(<i> panting</i> )

303
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,104
It's only a matter of time
until we break through
enemy lines,

304
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,815
and when that happens,

305
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,442
we can drive
the Federation-
Romulan alliance

306
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,569
out of Cardassian
territory.

307
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,656
A bit more<i> kanar?</i>

308
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,073
Please.

309
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,369
To victory...

310
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,080
on all fronts.

311
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,291
(<i> door opens</i> )

312
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,835
Damar, have you--

313
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:43,878
Weyoun.

314
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,881
This is Siana.

315
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:50,050
We met at the dinner last night
honoring Legate Hovas.

316
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:54,263
Damar, you and I have things
to discuss...

317
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,517
things that your guest
doesn't want to hear.

318
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,393
And why is that?

319
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:03,439
Because if she does, I'll be
forced to have her executed.

320
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,484
I really should be going.

321
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,821
Until tonight.

322
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,120
What a pleasant woman.

323
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,332
Now.

324
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:25,753
It's imperative
we increase production
at the Monac shipyard.

325
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,506
We need more assault ships
to retake

326
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,550
the Chin'toka system.

327
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,721
Damar,
are you listening to me?

328
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,891
Increase production.

329
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,099
Yes, I heard you.

330
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,434
By how much?

331
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,770
Fifteen percent
would be ideal.

332
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,480
That won't be easy.

333
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,274
Oh, I'm sure
you'll find a way.
You're very resourceful.

334
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,952
A blockade?

335
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,204
How many ships
are we talking about?

336
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,831
Twelve impulse ships.

337
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,709
It's all the Council
of Ministers could
spare right now.

338
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,210
And how effective
do you think

339
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,046
those 12 ships are going to be

340
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,798
against even<i> one</i>
Romulan warbird?

341
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,174
You sound
like Admiral Ross.

342
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,344
Well, I was hoping
that our relationship

343
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,304
was going to be
a long and happy one,

344
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:20,600
but I suppose I'm
willing to settle
for short and exciting.

345
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,226
What's that
supposed to mean?

346
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,646
I take it
you're going to be
commanding the blockade?

347
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,856
That's right.

348
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,191
Then I'm going to
be there with you.

349
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,193
You don't have to do that.

350
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,362
Yes, I do.

351
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,788
Well, I wouldn't start writing
our epitaphs just yet.

352
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:45,625
All right, I'll wait until
the first wave of Romulan ships

353
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,251
decide to run the blockade.

354
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,669
Don't worry.

355
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,671
I have no intention
of getting into a firefight

356
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,424
with a squadron
of Romulan warbirds.

357
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,384
You mean you're bluffing?

358
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,012
If the Romulans fire on us,

359
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,264
they jeopardize their alliance
with the Federation,

360
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,724
and I'm hoping

361
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,977
that that's a risk
they don't want to take.

362
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:09,148
And I'm hoping they
don't call your bluff.

363
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,754
Grandpa, you sure
you don't want to go
back up to the runabout?

364
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:36,300
We started this together
and we'll finish it together.

365
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,012
I owe it to Ben.

366
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,724
JAKE:
I got you.

367
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:47,394

368
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:03,452

369
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,627
Let's go.

00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,934

Benjamin.

375
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,982
Benjamin, is this it?

376
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,650
I think so.

377
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,069
You're not sure?

378
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,072
Ben, that's not
good enough.

379
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,991
Ben.

380
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,791
Are you listening to me?

381
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,167
(<i> echoing piano music</i> )

382
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,089
There.

383
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,173
Where?

384
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,010
That's where
we start digging.

385
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,725
Why there?

386
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,436
I wasn't even
aiming at anything.

387
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:57,275
Ben, maybe my memories
are playing tricks on me,

388
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:59,193
but have you
gotten stranger?

389
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:07,534

<i>Ship's Log, Stardate 52152.6.</i>

390
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,703
<i>We've set up a blockade</i>
<i>around Derna.</i>

391
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:13,499
<i>So far, no Romulan ships</i>
<i>have tried to challenge it.</i>

392
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,918
KIRA:
<i>"Kiss Me Deadly."</i> 
Interesting title.

393
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:19,379
Mmm. The book isn't bad, either.
I think you'll enjoy it.

394
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,048
I'm sure I will,
but is this really

395
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,009
the right time
to start reading a book?

396
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:26,344
Well, maybe not,
but I know how much
you hate all this waiting,

397
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:30,183
and Mike Hammer
has certain qualities
I think you'll appreciate.

398
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:32,392
Hmm...
such as?

399
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,228
He's as tough as they come,

400
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,814
and he hates waiting
almost as much as you do.

401
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,816
Oh, I like him already.
Hmm...

402
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,567
MAN:
Colonel, there's
a priority one

403
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,569
transmission
from Deep Space 9.

404
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,946
It's Admiral Ross.

405
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,240
Put him through.

406
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,951
ROSS:
Colonel, Senator Cretak
has just informed me

407
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:51,495
that 14 Romulan warbirds
are on their way to Derna.

408
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,331
They'll be arriving
in eight hours

409
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:55,749
with much-needed
medical supplies
for the hospital complex.

410
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,669
Since when did the Romulans
start using warbirds

411
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,713
to deliver
medical supplies?

412
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,215
We want to make sure
they arrive safely.

413
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:04,008
Well, if they try to get
through the blockade,

414
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,885
they're not going
to make it at all.

415
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,803
That kind of talk
isn't going to help
matters, Colonel.

416
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:11,098
I'd think you'd want to
avoid a confrontation,
not provoke one.

417
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:14,143
Well, I wouldn't call
those Romulan ships
a peace offering.

418
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,393
Well, I wasn't
exactly happy

419
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:17,021
to hear about
that, either...

420
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,522
but we only have
a few hours

421
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,566
to reach some sort
of compromise.

422
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,902
After that, people are
going to start dying.

423
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:25,863
Well, you can talk about
compromise all you want.

424
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:29,242
Any ship attempting to
break through that blockade

425
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:31,285
will be fired upon.

426
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:33,662
Colonel,
do you seriously believe

427
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,915
that your antiquated
collection of impulse ships

428
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:39,501
stands a chance
against our warbirds?

429
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,962
We'll find out
soon enough, won't we?

430
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,382
End transmission.

431
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:48,886
How'd I do?

432
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:51,805
Mike Hammer
would have been proud.

433
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,934
You're concerned.

434
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:57,353
Aren't you?

435
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:58,979
Not really.

436
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:04,026
The Colonel is a brave woman,
but she's not stupid.

437
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,071
She's bluffing.

438
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,914
JAKE:
Right over there. Shade.

439
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,841
Here.

440
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,135
Oh.

441
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,472
There you go, Grandpa.

442
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,688
<i>Dr. Wykoff, please come</i>
<i>to Isolation Ward 4.</i>

443
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:44,275
<i>Dr. Wykoff</i>
<i>to Isolation Ward 4.</i>

444
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:45,692
I wish he'd get there.

445
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,194
Who?

446
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,570
Dr. Wykoff.

447
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,572
They're waiting for him
in the Isolation Ward.

448
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:54,576
You have definitely
gotten stranger.

449
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,039
What about me, Worf?

450
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,292
Would you rather<i> I</i> hadn't come
on this mission, either?

451
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,002
That is<i> not</i> what
I am saying.

452
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,628
With you,
it is different.

453
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:08,341
You are a Klingon and Jadzia
was a member of your House.

454
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:10,343
And these men
were her friends.

455
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,345
They honor her
with their presence.

456
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:14,430
QUARK:
I don't believe it--<i> </i>
<i>gagh</i> for breakfast,

457
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,682
<i>gagh</i> for lunch,
<i>gagh</i> for dinner...

458
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,267
Am I the only one
who thinks

459
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,353
Klingon menus need
to have more variety?

460
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:22,980
You want to complain
about their<i> gagh,</i> 
that's fine with me,

461
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,024
but don't complain about it
when we're in the mess hall

462
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,318
sitting at a table surrounded
by a dozen Klingons.

463
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:29,695
All right, all right,
I get the point.
Good.

464
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:32,739
But I'm telling you, I think
some of those Klingons
agreed with me.

465
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:35,451
Look, uh, Worf,
if this has anything to do

466
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:36,910
with what just happened
in the mess hall...

467
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,205
No. No, it does not.
What's the matter?

468
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:41,499
Come up with a few more
insults to throw at us?

469
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,626
I wish to apologize.

470
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,504
I'm listening.

471
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:49,423
I know Jadzia meant
a great deal to all of you,

472
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:51,217
and you meant
a great deal to her.

473
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:54,053
Many times, when we
discussed our day

474
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,595
she would repeat
something amusing

475
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,431
that<i> you</i> had told her

476
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,892
or describe,
in endless detail,

477
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,978
the intricacies of some
new scheme of yours.

478
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,398
She often talked
about all of you.

479
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:10,403
It seemed as though,
even when we were alone...

480
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,197
one of you
was always with us.

481
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:14,781
QUARK:
I get it.

482
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,535
You were jealous
because she liked us
better than you.

483
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:20,871
Quark, would you<i> please</i>
keep quiet.

484
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:24,208
She was my wife,
my<i> par'machkai.</i>

485
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:28,212
I did not like having
to share her affections.

486
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:31,757
Oh, that's why you didn't
want us on this mission
with you.

487
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:35,177
You wanted to get her
into<i> Sto-Vo-Kor</i>
without our help.

488
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:39,348
I wanted it
to be my gift to her.

489
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,271
Go on.

490
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:49,607
There is nothing
more to say,

491
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:52,986
except that I am
pleased you're here.

492
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,036
I have never heard Worf
apologize to anyone.

493
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,580
I don't know
about you,

494
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,748
but I was hoping
for something

495
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,418
a little more...
intriguing.

496
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:08,919
Such as?

497
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:11,505
You know, like...
Jadzia used

498
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:15,884
to call my name out
when she slept, or...

499
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,678
wanted to name
her first child after me.

500
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,848
MARTOK:
Chief...

501
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,977
the Monac shipyard.

502
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,109
Impressive.

503
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:34,403
Display<i> our</i> target.

504
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:40,951
How close do we have
to get to that?

505
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,328
(<i> chuckling</i> )

506
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,371
Too close.

507
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,623
Perfect.

508
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,130
(<i> shovel clinking</i> )

509
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,389
What is it, Dad?
Have you found something?

510
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,390
(<i> panting</i> )

511
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,142
Stay back.

512
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,855
The Orb of the Emissary.

513
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,693
What are you
going to do?

514
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,739
Open it.

515
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:23,118
MAN:

516
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,914
<i>Mr. Russell, put it down.</i>

517
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:30,376
Benjamin,
what's wrong?

518
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:31,669
Benjamin.

519
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:34,338
MAN:
I said put down the pencil.

520
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,677
Put it down, Mr. Russell.

521
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:42,804
But I-I haven't finished
my story yet.

522
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,390

00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,350
the Orb of the Emissary...

524
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:51,771
but he hasn't opened it yet.

525
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,821
Mr. Russell, you promised
not to write on the walls.

526
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,657
No one will give me
any paper.

527
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,201
I thought we agreed

528
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:06,286
that you weren't going
to write at all...

529
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,829
that you needed to rest.

530
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,957
No, I don't need to rest.
I need to tell my stories.

531
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:13,335
You were doing so well, Benny,
making real progress.

532
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:15,128
We were all
so proud of you.

533
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,464
I-I need to go home.
I don't belong here.

534
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,592
And we're going to send you
home, as soon as you're well.

535
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:22,135
I'm fine.
But you're not fine.

536
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,054
People who are fine
don't write on walls.

537
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,599
Then get me a typewriter.
You're not listening.

538
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,601
The stories have
got to stop, Benny.

539
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:30,227
They are
too dangerous.

540
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:33,355
But too dangerous
to whom?
To<i> you.</i>

541
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:37,693
This world you've created,
this... Deep Space 9,

542
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:42,030
Captain Sisko and Kira
and the others...
none of it is real.

543
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,242
Oh, it is to me.

544
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:48,370
If I don't...
finish my story...

545
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,040
if... if Captain Sisko
doesn't open the Orb box,

546
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,752
then he cannot contact
the Prophets.

547
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:56,795
It doesn't
matter, Benny.

548
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,256
The Prophets
don't exist.

549
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:01,592
They're all figments
of your imagination.

550
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:03,176
Get rid of them.

551
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,178
It's the only way
that you're going
to get well.

552
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,180
Now, give me
the pencil, Benny.

553
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,390
But my story!

554
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,435
It's over.

555
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,312
Just let it go.

556
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:14,730
EZRI:
<i>Benjamin,</i>

557
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,649
what are you
waiting for? Open it.

558
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:19,025
That's why
we're here, right?

559
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,860
He can't hear you.

560
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,408
(<i> groaning</i> )

561
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:27,534
Jake!

562
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:33,540
Jake... are you all right?

563
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,833
Yeah.

564
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,252
KIRA:
<i>Ship's Log, supplemental.</i>

565
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,963
<i>Senator Cretak said</i>
<i>that the Romulan warbirds</i>

566
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,590
<i>would be here in eight hours.</i>

567
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,843
<i>She was wrong.</i>
<i>They're two hours early.</i>

568
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:48,013
They'll be in weapons
range in eight minutes.

569
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,306
Open a channel.

570
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:50,849
Go ahead.

571
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:54,269
This is Colonel Kira
of the Bajoran Militia.

572
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,230
Any ship traveling within
transporter range of Derna

573
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,233
will be considered hostile
and fired upon.

574
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,907
They're not responding.

575
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:12,204
Kira to all Bajoran ships.
Prepare to engage.

576
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,707
Sir, Admiral Ross
is asking to speak to you.

577
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:15,791
Put him through.

578
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:18,084
Colonel,
I'm appealing to you

579
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,670
one last time to
end this blockade.

580
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,005
Well, you know
I can't do that, Admiral.

581
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,300
Be aware that
I'm authorized to use
whatever force is necessary

582
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,137
to see that our medical supplies
reach their destination.

583
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:32,891
However, I'm also
authorized to seek

584
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,393
a negotiated settlement.

585
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:37,813
My government has made
its position quite clear.

586
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,398
There are to be no negotiations

587
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,568
as long as there are
Romulan weapons on Derna.

588
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:43,985
Damn it, Colonel.

589
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,863
If you open fire on those
ships, we all lose.

590
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:47,280
The only way to
beat the Dominion

591
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,907
is to keep our
alliance intact.

592
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,411
Besides... I would hate
to see you throw
your life away.

593
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,621
Your concern is
touching, Senator.

594
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,377
But I'm not dead yet.

595
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:02,087
End transmission.

596
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:11,764
At least not for
another six minutes.

597
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,727
You still think she's
going to back down?

598
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:19,438
She has to...

599
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,607
because I won't.

600
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:32,284
Take me out of the oven,
Moogie.

601
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,077
I'm cooked.

602
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,662
General, I found it--

603
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,539
a magnetic instability
near the sun's equator.

604
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,249
Excellent.
Now, let's trigger

605
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:41,418
that solar ejection
and get out of here.

606
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:42,795
I'm afraid it's
not that simple.

607
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:44,045
We have to make sure

608
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,881
the ejection has
the right trajectory

609
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:46,882
to destroy
the shipyard.

610
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:48,425
Well, how do
we do that?!

611
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:50,803
We have to get
closer--<i> much</i> closer.

612
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:52,220
He's right.

613
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:56,475
<i>Sto-Vo-Kor...</i>

614
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,644
here we come.

615
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:00,687
(<i> tapping pencil</i> )

616
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,482
Take it, Benny.

617
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,317
What for?

618
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:08,278
I'm offering you
an opportunity few
people ever get.

619
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:10,530
You can wipe away
all your mistakes.

620
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,991
You want me
to paint over my story?

621
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,576
They're
only words.

622
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:15,994
(<i> laughing</i> )

623
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,122
Meaningless words that
no one cares about.

624
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:22,292
Get rid of them and you
can walk out of here
a free man.

625
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,169
(<i> continues laughing</i> )

626
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,464
Go ahead.

627
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:29,007
Save yourself.

628
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:43,104
Ben?

629
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,356
I've got to cover it up;
bury it.

630
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,065
Ben, what are
you doing?

631
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:59,579
It's for your
own good, Benny.

632
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,039
Wipe away the words.

633
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,083
Destroy them before
they destroy you.

634
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,549
Ben, stop!

635
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:24,354
The Romulans have
powered their weapons.

636
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:25,772
I think they're
calling your bluff.

637
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,483
Auxiliary power
to forward shields.

638
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,737
Kira to all ships.
Hold your positions.

639
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:35,240
Nerys, if you're going to end
this, I suggest you do it now.

640
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:43,498
Time to fold,
Colonel.

641
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,088
Oh, damn it.

642
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,924
We're ready, General.

643
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:58,263
De-cloak and prepare to fire...

644
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:00,348
on Worf's command.

645
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,529
Fire!

646
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:30,587
(<i> sighs</i> ):
It didn't work.

647
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:32,881
Oh, well,
we tried.

648
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:34,382
Time to go.

649
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,094
No! Not until we complete
our mission.

650
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:38,804
We'll have to increase
the magnetic gradient.

651
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,764
I'll recalibrate the deflector.

652
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:42,223
BASHIR:
We might not
have time.

653
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,059
There are three Jem'Hadar ships
approaching.

654
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:48,105
Bearing 005 mark 190.

655
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:50,941
I suggest
you work quickly, Chief.

656
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,284
No!

657
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,202
Get out of my way.

658
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:06,289
Ben, you came here to find
the Prophets, remember?

659
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,290
Move!

660
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,792
No, listen to me!

661
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:11,294
You promised Jadzia
you would make things right.

662
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,754
Well, now is your chance.

663
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:14,714
Open the box, Ben.

664
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:23,556
No!

665
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:57,465
(<i> heartbeat thudding</i> )

666
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,478
Colonel...

667
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,189
do we stand down?

668
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:15,734
Sir, we're getting
a transmission

669
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:16,776
from Deep Space 9.

670
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:20,030
The wormhole...
it's back.

671
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,907
On screen.

672
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,415
Nerys?

673
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:39,465
Open a channel
to all Bajoran ships.

674
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:42,761
Hold your positions
and prepare to fire
on my command.

675
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,763
Lock targets.
CREWMAN:
Targets locked.

676
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,181
Still glad
you came along?

677
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:48,349
I wouldn't have missed it
for anything.

678
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:52,478
I'm afraid the Colonel
has run out of time.

(<i> yelling</i> )

680
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:06,076
Well, Worf, did I not promise
you a glorious battle?

681
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:08,578
It is everything
I hoped for.

682
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:11,998
EM pulse ready, General.

683
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,877
What are you
waiting for? Fire!

684
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:18,255
By all means, Chief, fire!

685
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,346
It's working!

686
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:30,683
Great. Now, can we leave?

687
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,020
Full impulse.

<i>pay-lodge poh'hoqH-vahd</i>

700
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:41,296
<i>Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

701
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:56,102
Nerys,
they're pulling back.

702
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,897
CREWMAN:
Colonel, Admiral Ross
would like to speak with you.

703
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,024
Put him through.

704
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,235
You can blink now, Colonel.

705
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:04,277
You've won.

706
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:05,820
Senator Cretak has agreed

707
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,864
to remove the weapons
from Derna.

708
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:09,490
What changed her mind?

709
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:13,119
I told her if she didn't
remove them, I would.

710
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,080
Then what changed
<i>your</i> mind?

711
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,582
<i>You</i> did.

712
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,668
Remind me never to play poker
with you.

713
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,972
(<i> heartbeat thudding</i> )

714
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:35,600
Show yourselves.

715
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,852
I've come to speak with you.

716
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,437
(<i> piano playing</i> )

717
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:49,030
(<i> ball thumps to ground,</i>
<i>music stops</i> )

718
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:57,914
The Sisko
has completed his task.

719
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:59,999
Sarah?

720
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:05,380
The Kosst Amojan
no longer threatens us.

721
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,048
You mean the Pah-wraith?

722
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:08,716
It's no longer in the wormhole?

723
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,385
I have cast it out.

724
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:13,972
Is that why the Prophets
sent me to Tyree...

725
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,932
to release you from the Orb?

726
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:20,312
The Kosst Amojan tried
to stop you with a false vision,

727
00:41:20,312 --> 00:41:22,814
but you did not waver.

728
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,691
You fulfilled your destiny.

729
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,986
My destiny?

730
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,862
You talk as if my life was over.

731
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:33,950
The Sisko
must still face many tasks.

732
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,537
I don't suppose you'll
tell me what they are.

733
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:44,294
The Emissary
is corporeal, linear.

734
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:45,711
Linear or not,

735
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:48,089
I need some answers.

736
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,300
The Sisko is intrusive.

737
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,884
Are you Sarah Sisko?

738
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,678
Are you my mother?

739
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:58,516
Sarah Sisko was corporeal.

740
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:02,395
For a time,
I shared her existence.

741
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:04,772
You took over her body...

742
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:08,818
made sure she
married my father...

743
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,906
so that she'd
give birth to me.

744
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,825
The Sisko is necessary.

745
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:20,246
And once you didn't need
her anymore, you left her.

746
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:23,375
No wonder she walked
out on my father.

747
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:26,794
She didn't choose
him,<i> you</i> did.

748
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:31,383
The Sisko would prefer
different answers.

749
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:34,010
What you're telling me
isn't easy to accept.

750
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,346
You arranged my birth.

751
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:39,557
I exist because of you?

752
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,101
The Sisko's path
is a difficult one.

753
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,103
But why me?!

754
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:47,982
Why did it have to be me?

755
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:51,361
Because it could be
no one else.

756
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:59,160
(<i> sighs</i> )

757
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,748
Benjamin?

758
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:09,504
That must have been
some Orb experience.

759
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:12,173
I'll tell you about it
someday.

760
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,015
MALE:
Bravo.

761
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,350
(<i> crowd clamoring</i> )

762
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,561
Emissary, welcome.

763
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:33,027
WORF:
Welcome back,
Captain.

764
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,780
We missed you, sir.
Thank you for bringing
the Prophets back to us.

765
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,741
I heard you've all been
pretty busy yourselves.

766
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,873
Odo! Nerys, Julian,
it's so good to see you.

767
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,542
Worf, we need to talk.

768
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:48,543
Who's that?

769
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:50,462
That's Dax.
Dax?

770
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:53,381
That's right.
Ezri Dax.

771
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:54,882
Incredible,
isn't it?

772
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,092
It cannot be.

773
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:58,553
She's so much... shorter.

774
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:00,513
ODO:
Just when you thought

775
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:03,558
things couldn't get
more interesting.
