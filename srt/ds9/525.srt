1
00:00:21,147 --> 00:00:23,141
Did you hear
about the <i>Tian An Men?</i>

2
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:24,849
She was reported
missing last night

3
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,189
near the Cardassian border.

4
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:27,821
That's three
in the last three weeks.

5
00:00:27,864 --> 00:00:29,664
At this rate, we're going
to run out of ships.

6
00:00:29,702 --> 00:00:30,830
Well, that's not funny.

7
00:00:30,871 --> 00:00:32,033
It wasn't meant to be.

8
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:35,744
Unless Starfleet Command
actually starts doing something

9
00:00:35,784 --> 00:00:38,222
about the Dominion threat,
the situation's

10
00:00:38,257 --> 00:00:39,556
only going to get worse.

11
00:00:39,594 --> 00:00:42,796
Well, what do you want, Julian,
a war?

12
00:00:42,836 --> 00:00:45,240
What I want
is to talk about something else.

13
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:47,570
Chief...

14
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:49,107
what about Kirayoshi?

15
00:00:49,153 --> 00:00:50,622
Is he walking yet?

16
00:00:50,656 --> 00:00:52,286
No.

17
00:00:52,328 --> 00:00:54,458
Not yet, no.

18
00:00:55,669 --> 00:00:57,229
Odo, I understand

19
00:00:57,273 --> 00:00:59,905
you're going to Bajor next week.

20
00:00:59,947 --> 00:01:02,181
Do you plan to see Dr. Mora?

21
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,752
Uh... actually,
I've canceled my trip.

22
00:01:05,796 --> 00:01:11,175
There's been a 75 percent jump
in the theft of medical supplies

23
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,546
and food rations on DS9.

24
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:16,215
I haven't seen
such an increase since...

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,956
Since?

26
00:01:20,835 --> 00:01:25,006
Since just before
the Cardassians were forced

27
00:01:25,046 --> 00:01:27,040
to abandon the station.

28
00:01:29,257 --> 00:01:32,527
On that note,
I think I'll turn in.

29
00:01:33,602 --> 00:01:35,664
Oh, me, too.

30
00:01:35,707 --> 00:01:37,337
Thank you for dinner, Captain.

31
00:01:37,378 --> 00:01:38,847
It was wonderful.

32
00:01:38,882 --> 00:01:40,351
It was my pleasure.

33
00:01:40,452 --> 00:01:41,921
Sir.

34
00:01:41,956 --> 00:01:44,052
Good night, everyone.

35
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,233
Mr. Worf.

36
00:01:48,573 --> 00:01:49,667
You've been paroled.

37
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:50,700
The party's over.

38
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:54,381
Thank you, sir.

39
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:56,816
Good night.

40
00:01:59,903 --> 00:02:01,372
Don't bother.

41
00:02:01,407 --> 00:02:02,671
I'll clean the rest up later.

42
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,111
I want to be alone for a while.

43
00:02:04,147 --> 00:02:05,138
Go on.

44
00:02:05,183 --> 00:02:07,177
Okay.

45
00:02:07,221 --> 00:02:08,851
Good night, sir.

46
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,723
Ops to Captain Sisko.

47
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:21,885
Go ahead.

48
00:02:21,927 --> 00:02:24,057
We just received a message
from Bajor, sir.

49
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:26,401
Kai Winn will be coming
to the station tomorrow morning

50
00:02:26,505 --> 00:02:28,567
and she'd like to meet with you.

51
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,444
Acknowledged.

52
00:02:34,961 --> 00:02:36,932
Thanks for
the invitation, Jake.

53
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:39,302
That was a lot of fun.

54
00:02:39,339 --> 00:02:41,105
Did you see
how down my dad was?

55
00:02:41,143 --> 00:02:42,112
He tried to hide it

56
00:02:42,146 --> 00:02:43,672
but I could tell
he was depressed.

57
00:02:43,717 --> 00:02:45,152
He's not the only one.

58
00:02:45,187 --> 00:02:46,315
Look around.

59
00:02:46,357 --> 00:02:48,157
There's something in the air.

60
00:02:48,195 --> 00:02:49,630
People are scared.

61
00:02:49,665 --> 00:02:51,032
Yeah, but he's usually the one

62
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:52,733
who tries to lift
everyone's spirits.

63
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,801
I mean, people go to him
for encouragement.

64
00:02:54,845 --> 00:02:57,147
Where does he go
when he needs it?

65
00:02:57,185 --> 00:03:00,182
I hope I'll be seeing
the two of you tomorrow

66
00:03:00,226 --> 00:03:01,195
at 1200 hours.

67
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:02,562
Why?

68
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,433
Why?
Haven't you heard?

69
00:03:04,504 --> 00:03:06,099
There's going to be an auction

70
00:03:06,141 --> 00:03:10,278
of some of the galaxy's rarest
and most valuable antiquities.

71
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,193
Here.
Find something you like

72
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:15,698
and make a bid
with all that latinum

73
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:17,397
you've got stashed
under your bed.

74
00:03:17,437 --> 00:03:19,032
Shh!

75
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:22,949
Oh, Nog, you don't really
keep it under your bed?

76
00:03:22,985 --> 00:03:25,651
No, of course not.

77
00:03:25,692 --> 00:03:27,390
Where'd you get
all this stuff, Quark?

78
00:03:27,429 --> 00:03:31,462
I'm just conducting the auction
for a modest commission.

79
00:03:31,507 --> 00:03:33,033
The items up for sale

80
00:03:33,077 --> 00:03:35,743
were all aboard
an old derelict freighter

81
00:03:35,785 --> 00:03:39,784
that the Bajorans found adrift
about a light-year from here.

82
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:42,894
The cargo hold was crammed
with valuable items

83
00:03:42,937 --> 00:03:44,532
of every description:

84
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,079
Antiques, paintings, vehicles.

85
00:03:47,114 --> 00:03:49,916
It's all a bunch of junk.

86
00:03:49,955 --> 00:03:51,550
Listen to some of this stuff.

87
00:03:51,593 --> 00:03:56,060
A mid-24th century,
ceramic Romulan water basin...

88
00:03:56,104 --> 00:03:57,539
slightly cracked.

89
00:03:57,575 --> 00:04:00,413
A pair of Tellarite shoes...
date unknown.

90
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,183
A mid-20th century
hu-man baseball card.

91
00:04:03,223 --> 00:04:04,522
A Tholian pedestal...

92
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,531
A baseball card!

93
00:04:06,565 --> 00:04:08,468
A mint condition, 1951

94
00:04:08,503 --> 00:04:10,474
Willie Mays rookie card!

95
00:04:10,508 --> 00:04:11,772
Nog, this is it!

96
00:04:11,811 --> 00:04:12,780
What do you mean?

97
00:04:12,814 --> 00:04:14,113
It's perfect.

98
00:04:14,151 --> 00:04:16,145
This is how I can
cheer up my dad.

99
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,319
You know how much
he loves baseball.

100
00:04:18,362 --> 00:04:20,333
He'll go nuts when he sees this.

101
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:22,737
Tell him to be here
at 1200 hours

102
00:04:22,774 --> 00:04:25,714
and he can bid
along with everyone else.

103
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:28,312
No.
I'm going to bid on this.

104
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:29,722
He's always doing things for me.

105
00:04:29,758 --> 00:04:31,592
I want to do something for him
for a change.

106
00:04:31,663 --> 00:04:33,132
And this is it.

107
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:36,107
All I have to do
is get him this card.

108
00:04:36,141 --> 00:04:38,135
How hard can that be?

109
00:06:39,706 --> 00:06:40,675
Come on, Nog.

110
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:41,573
No.

111
00:06:41,644 --> 00:06:42,577
Why not?

112
00:06:42,646 --> 00:06:43,808
It's my money, Jake.

113
00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:45,409
If you want to bid
at the auction,

114
00:06:45,454 --> 00:06:46,423
use your own money.

115
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:48,586
I'm human...
I don't have any money.

116
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:50,931
It's not my fault
your species decided

117
00:06:50,968 --> 00:06:53,132
to abandon
currency-based economics

118
00:06:53,174 --> 00:06:56,205
in favor of some philosophy
of self-enhancement.

119
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:57,547
Hey, watch it.

120
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:59,613
There's nothing wrong
with our philosophy.

121
00:06:59,724 --> 00:07:01,091
We work to better ourselves

122
00:07:01,128 --> 00:07:02,461
and the rest of humanity.

123
00:07:02,498 --> 00:07:04,492
What does that mean exactly?

124
00:07:04,536 --> 00:07:06,564
It means...

125
00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:09,046
it means we don't need money.

126
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:12,249
Well, if you don't need money

127
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,626
then you certainly
don't need mine.

128
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:20,043
How much latinum do you have?

129
00:07:22,115 --> 00:07:23,209
How much?

130
00:07:23,252 --> 00:07:25,280
Five bars.

131
00:07:25,323 --> 00:07:26,724
Five bars!

132
00:07:26,761 --> 00:07:29,461
Look, it's taken me a lifetime
to save up that much money

133
00:07:29,501 --> 00:07:32,566
and I'm not just going to throw
it away for some baseball card.

134
00:07:40,697 --> 00:07:43,033
Not even for my father...

135
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,665
the man who made it possible

136
00:07:44,774 --> 00:07:47,246
for you to enter
Starfleet Academy?

137
00:07:48,383 --> 00:07:50,183
Oh, no.
That's not fair.

138
00:07:50,222 --> 00:07:52,854
The man who believed in you
when no one else would.

139
00:07:52,895 --> 00:07:55,333
Oh, this is so low.

140
00:07:55,368 --> 00:07:57,704
I can't believe you'd rather
keep your filthy money

141
00:07:57,775 --> 00:07:59,643
locked up in a box
under a bed

142
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:03,782
than use it to give him
endless moments of happiness.

143
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:06,962
All right!
All right!

144
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:08,902
I'll do it.

145
00:08:08,937 --> 00:08:11,671
That's very generous of you,
Nog.

146
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,179
I'm proud of you.

147
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:15,487
Now, let's get that money.

148
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,352
Hu-mans.

149
00:08:33,734 --> 00:08:35,226
Come in.

150
00:08:37,744 --> 00:08:41,208
Welcome back to Deep Space 9,
Your Eminence.

151
00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:43,224
Thank you, Emissary.

152
00:08:43,258 --> 00:08:45,252
You may go now, child.

153
00:08:48,105 --> 00:08:49,597
Thank you.

154
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:55,380
Why don't we take a walk?

155
00:08:55,423 --> 00:08:57,291
A walk?

156
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,094
Yes.
Would you mind?

157
00:09:00,403 --> 00:09:02,705
Something wrong, Eminence?

158
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,210
No, nothing wrong

159
00:09:04,246 --> 00:09:07,048
but there was a shop
down there, as I recall...

160
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:10,391
a woman who sold
Bajoran tapestries and antiques.

161
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:12,400
Ah. Kandra Vilk.

162
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:13,403
Yes.

163
00:09:13,437 --> 00:09:15,671
I believe she moved
to a neutral world

164
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,376
near the Cordon system
about two months ago.

165
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:22,593
So many people have
left Deep Space 9

166
00:09:22,627 --> 00:09:24,495
in the last few months.

167
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:27,004
I'm sure there are times
when you must feel

168
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,375
as if you're
being abandoned here.

169
00:09:29,412 --> 00:09:30,745
Forgive me, Eminence

170
00:09:30,782 --> 00:09:33,016
but I have a very
busy day ahead of me.

171
00:09:35,928 --> 00:09:39,461
I'm here to meet a
representative of the Dominion.

172
00:09:39,505 --> 00:09:41,408
To what end?

173
00:09:41,443 --> 00:09:43,141
I... I don't know.

174
00:09:43,181 --> 00:09:45,653
This meeting is being
held at their request.

175
00:09:45,687 --> 00:09:47,624
You disapprove?

176
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:48,923
I'm concerned.

177
00:09:48,962 --> 00:09:52,426
The Dominion is notorious
for its political intrigue.

178
00:09:52,471 --> 00:09:57,941
Well, I have some experience
in that area, as well.

179
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:04,095
This is a delicate moment
for Bajor.

180
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:07,234
This conflict between the
Federation and the Dominion

181
00:10:07,276 --> 00:10:11,150
could escalate into
open warfare at any moment.

182
00:10:11,186 --> 00:10:15,755
A misstep now could result
in the destruction of our world.

183
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:19,832
For once, I am
in complete agreement with you.

184
00:10:19,876 --> 00:10:21,540
You have my word

185
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,178
I will do whatever it takes
to safeguard Bajor.

186
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,126
Walk with the Prophets.

187
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:45,071
The bid is to you, sir...

188
00:10:45,108 --> 00:10:47,079
one bar, three strips.

189
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:50,110
Don't let the lady
steal this fine example

190
00:10:50,155 --> 00:10:52,559
of post-Eventualistic,
pre-Matoian

191
00:10:52,593 --> 00:10:56,160
bronze and triptin sculpture
for such a pittance.

192
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:58,939
One bar, three strips.

193
00:10:58,978 --> 00:11:01,610
One bar, four strips,
and it's all yours...

194
00:11:01,651 --> 00:11:04,625
an honorable addition
to any Klingon household.

195
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:06,128
Remember...

196
00:11:06,162 --> 00:11:08,133
all the proceeds
from this auction

197
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,331
go to the Bajoran
War Orphans Fund...

198
00:11:10,374 --> 00:11:11,934
minus a modest commission.

199
00:11:11,977 --> 00:11:15,145
Think of those poor,
lonely children

200
00:11:15,186 --> 00:11:17,624
and how much your latinum
will mean to them.

201
00:11:19,296 --> 00:11:21,996
Looks like the kids
will have to make do

202
00:11:22,104 --> 00:11:24,007
with one bar, three strips.

203
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:26,810
Sold to the blue man
in the good shoes.

204
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,323
Lot 48.

205
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:32,023
An Andorian chest

206
00:11:32,064 --> 00:11:34,696
containing a pre-Surak
Vulcan bracelet

207
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:37,175
a sixth century Bajoran mandala

208
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,546
a 23rd century ion-transtator

209
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:44,824
a Willie Mays baseball card
from Earth, dated 1951.

210
00:11:44,863 --> 00:11:47,233
Who will start
the bidding with one bar

211
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:48,704
of gold-pressed latinum?

212
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:51,405
- One bar.
- One bar.

213
00:11:51,446 --> 00:11:53,212
Do I hear one bar, five strips?

214
00:11:53,251 --> 00:11:56,487
One bar, five strips.

215
00:11:56,527 --> 00:11:57,689
Do I hear one bar, ten?

216
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,790
Don't worry.

217
00:11:58,832 --> 00:12:00,462
He'll drop out at two bars.

218
00:12:00,504 --> 00:12:02,030
How do you know that?

219
00:12:02,108 --> 00:12:03,407
I'm still a Ferengi.

220
00:12:03,445 --> 00:12:06,043
- One bar, ten.
- One bar, ten.

221
00:12:06,118 --> 00:12:07,553
One, 15?

222
00:12:09,093 --> 00:12:10,893
One, 15.
One, 20?

223
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:13,162
One, 20.

224
00:12:13,203 --> 00:12:14,399
One, 25?

225
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:15,567
Two bars.

226
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,637
The bid is two bars.

227
00:12:17,681 --> 00:12:20,951
Do I hear two bars, five?

228
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,084
Vedek, are you in?

229
00:12:22,194 --> 00:12:24,530
I told you.

230
00:12:24,566 --> 00:12:26,503
Two bars, five.

231
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:27,666
Three bars.

232
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,472
Four bars.

233
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:32,487
Jake.

234
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,887
Ten bars.

235
00:12:33,923 --> 00:12:36,863
The bid is ten bars

236
00:12:36,898 --> 00:12:38,630
of gold-pressed latinum.

237
00:12:38,669 --> 00:12:40,229
Is there another bid?

238
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:42,073
What do we do now?

239
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,512
Nothing.
We're out of money.

240
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:45,817
Jake, do you want
to make another bid?

241
00:12:49,965 --> 00:12:53,371
Sold to the gentleman
sitting in the aisle.

242
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:56,005
Lot 49.

243
00:12:56,048 --> 00:13:01,791
A rare example of a 20th-century
human art form...

244
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:03,766
acrylic on black velvet.

245
00:13:03,801 --> 00:13:06,273
This image was the inspiration

246
00:13:06,308 --> 00:13:10,513
for the flag of the Martian
Colony in the 22nd...

247
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:16,129
Look, I-I-I know
you wanted that card

248
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:17,636
but we lost it, okay?

249
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,006
So let's come up
with something else

250
00:13:20,043 --> 00:13:21,911
to cheer up your dad, huh?

251
00:13:21,948 --> 00:13:24,078
Uh... like a new pair
of shoes.

252
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:25,181
Shoes?

253
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,623
What's wrong with shoes?

254
00:13:26,661 --> 00:13:28,325
Nothing, except it's stupid.

255
00:13:28,365 --> 00:13:30,336
I want to give
my dad something

256
00:13:30,371 --> 00:13:33,139
that'll bring a little
joy into his life.

257
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:34,510
Something special.

258
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,349
I'm telling you, that
baseball card is the answer.

259
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:38,358
It's kismet.

260
00:13:38,391 --> 00:13:39,860
"Kiss you"?

261
00:13:39,895 --> 00:13:41,228
Kismet... fate.

262
00:13:41,332 --> 00:13:42,824
Destiny.

263
00:13:42,869 --> 00:13:45,866
I was meant to give
that card to my father.

264
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,579
Jake, I think you're taking
this whole baseball card thing

265
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,089
way too seriously.

266
00:13:51,124 --> 00:13:52,822
It's not the card.

267
00:13:52,861 --> 00:13:54,262
It's my dad.

268
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:58,002
This is very important to me.

269
00:13:58,042 --> 00:13:59,808
My father's never let me down.

270
00:13:59,847 --> 00:14:02,844
He's always been there for me
when I needed him

271
00:14:02,887 --> 00:14:06,225
and right now, he needs me.

272
00:14:06,297 --> 00:14:08,131
I don't want to let him down.

273
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,242
Nog, please.

274
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:14,146
Let's get that card.

275
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,523
All right.

276
00:14:18,562 --> 00:14:20,396
What do you want to do?

277
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:29,256
Sir.

278
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,418
Excuse me.

279
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,762
Sir? Could we talk
to you for a minute?

280
00:14:32,798 --> 00:14:33,767
Who sent you?

281
00:14:33,801 --> 00:14:35,031
No one.

282
00:14:35,071 --> 00:14:37,042
We wish to discuss
a business transaction.

283
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,136
Not interested.

284
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:40,082
You don't even know
what it is yet.

285
00:14:40,118 --> 00:14:42,055
We just want to buy
the baseball card.

286
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,058
Listen to me.

287
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:44,493
I haven't done anything wrong

288
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:45,964
and I won't be hounded by you

289
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:47,902
and your soulless minions
of orthodoxy.

290
00:14:47,938 --> 00:14:50,308
I haven't broken any laws

291
00:14:50,344 --> 00:14:52,543
except, perhaps,
the laws of nature...

292
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,215
so stay away from me.

293
00:14:59,401 --> 00:15:01,065
Habitat Ring.

294
00:15:14,741 --> 00:15:16,609
Captain Sisko!

295
00:15:16,645 --> 00:15:19,983
I can't tell you how happy
I am to see you again.

296
00:15:20,021 --> 00:15:21,490
I wish I could say the same.

297
00:15:23,463 --> 00:15:24,830
How delightful!

298
00:15:24,867 --> 00:15:27,864
You feel comfortable enough
around me to make jokes.

299
00:15:27,908 --> 00:15:30,540
I'm so pleased to see
our relationship evolving

300
00:15:30,582 --> 00:15:32,678
beyond
the stale adversarial stage.

301
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:35,593
No, it's not, but before you
twist that into a compliment

302
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:37,897
let me be blunt:
I don't like the Dominion.

303
00:15:37,934 --> 00:15:40,702
I don't like what it stands for
and I don't like you.

304
00:15:40,742 --> 00:15:42,872
So let's dispense
with the hollow pleasantries

305
00:15:42,914 --> 00:15:44,383
and stick to business.

306
00:15:44,418 --> 00:15:46,446
I can't tell you how it pains me

307
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,256
to hear you say that, Captain.

308
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:52,671
You see, I really like
Deep Space 9 and I like you

309
00:15:52,706 --> 00:15:54,506
and after this meeting
with Kai Winn

310
00:15:54,544 --> 00:15:58,452
I think you and I will be seeing
a lot more of each other.

311
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,544
Jake... Jake!

312
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,520
He wants to see us!

313
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:13,253
- Who?
- Dr. Giger...

314
00:16:13,293 --> 00:16:14,626
the man who bought
the baseball card.

315
00:16:14,663 --> 00:16:15,962
He wants us
to come to his quarters.

316
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,096
He says he's willing
to make a deal.

317
00:16:18,172 --> 00:16:19,105
You're kidding.

318
00:16:19,174 --> 00:16:20,438
No.
He left a message for us

319
00:16:20,478 --> 00:16:21,606
about an hour ago.

320
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,744
It said to meet him
at 1800 hours.

321
00:16:23,787 --> 00:16:25,758
That's in ten minutes.
Let's go.

322
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:33,133
Remember... let me
do the talking.

323
00:16:33,178 --> 00:16:34,306
You?!

324
00:16:34,347 --> 00:16:36,318
You had your chance
on the Promenade.

325
00:16:36,353 --> 00:16:37,481
Now, stand aside

326
00:16:37,522 --> 00:16:39,516
and let a professional
handle this.

327
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,566
Step out of the doorway, please

328
00:16:57,608 --> 00:16:58,975
and don't touch anything.

329
00:16:59,012 --> 00:17:01,006
This is very
sensitive equipment.

330
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,766
I did some checking on you two.

331
00:17:07,801 --> 00:17:10,000
It turns out that you are
the Station Commander's son

332
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,407
and you are
the nephew of the man

333
00:17:11,444 --> 00:17:12,606
who owns the bar.

334
00:17:12,647 --> 00:17:14,345
That's right.

335
00:17:14,384 --> 00:17:16,116
Since you are not, in fact

336
00:17:16,156 --> 00:17:18,594
working for the soulless minions
of orthodoxy

337
00:17:18,629 --> 00:17:21,431
that have hounded my work
and plagued my existence

338
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,603
I have decided to open
negotiations regarding the sale

339
00:17:24,645 --> 00:17:26,616
of a mint condition
1951 Willie Mays

340
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,884
rookie card...
without the original

341
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,553
packaging or chewing gum.

342
00:17:30,593 --> 00:17:32,223
Excellent.
We would like to open

343
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:33,926
the negotiations
with a bid...

344
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,667
The card is not for sale.

345
00:17:35,706 --> 00:17:36,732
What?!

346
00:17:36,776 --> 00:17:38,006
But you just said...

347
00:17:38,046 --> 00:17:40,245
I am willing to trade the card

348
00:17:40,285 --> 00:17:42,279
in exchange
for the following items.

349
00:17:46,969 --> 00:17:50,273
Two liters of anaerobic
metabolites suspended

350
00:17:50,378 --> 00:17:52,474
in a hydrosaline solution?

351
00:17:52,517 --> 00:17:53,918
A neodymium power cell?

352
00:17:53,954 --> 00:17:55,948
Where are we supposed
to get all this stuff?

353
00:17:57,329 --> 00:17:59,528
Surely
the Station Commander's son

354
00:17:59,569 --> 00:18:02,235
and a promising young cadet
have access to a wide variety

355
00:18:02,342 --> 00:18:03,402
of equipment and supplies

356
00:18:03,445 --> 00:18:05,439
that would not be available
to someone like myself.

357
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,579
It's a very long list.

358
00:18:07,622 --> 00:18:08,955
It'll take some doing.

359
00:18:08,993 --> 00:18:10,019
Wait a minute.

360
00:18:10,062 --> 00:18:11,999
What are you planning
to do with these things?

361
00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:13,367
Nog...

362
00:18:13,405 --> 00:18:16,277
Look, we can't start
delivering equipment

363
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:17,406
and medical supplies to you

364
00:18:17,448 --> 00:18:19,784
without knowing what you're
going to do with them.

365
00:18:19,821 --> 00:18:21,815
Very well, young man.

366
00:18:23,664 --> 00:18:26,661
Let me ask you both
a simple question.

367
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,310
Do you want to die?

368
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:32,316
No.

369
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,319
Not really.

370
00:18:33,423 --> 00:18:35,485
Of course you don't.
So why should you?

371
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:38,330
Why should any of us end up
as putrefying corpses

372
00:18:38,436 --> 00:18:40,270
in wooden boxes
stuck in the ground?

373
00:18:40,308 --> 00:18:43,305
Or vaporized
into subatomic particles

374
00:18:43,348 --> 00:18:46,550
and vented into the cosmos
like a bad case of gas?

375
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:49,189
No reason that I can think of.

376
00:18:49,231 --> 00:18:55,476
I have devoted my life...
to the study of death

377
00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:57,382
and do you know what I found?

378
00:18:57,485 --> 00:18:59,547
Death is nothing more
than the result

379
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,858
of cellular boredom.

380
00:19:01,897 --> 00:19:03,834
"Boredom?"

381
00:19:03,868 --> 00:19:04,837
Think about it.

382
00:19:04,871 --> 00:19:05,897
The cells in your body

383
00:19:05,941 --> 00:19:07,467
have been doing the same job...

384
00:19:07,511 --> 00:19:10,279
the same dull,
monotonous routine

385
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:12,483
every day
since you were conceived:

386
00:19:12,524 --> 00:19:14,552
Metabolize, divide,
metabolize, divide.

387
00:19:14,596 --> 00:19:15,565
Wouldn't you get bored?

388
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:16,693
Of course you would.

389
00:19:16,736 --> 00:19:20,371
So, at some point, the cells
just say, "That's it."

390
00:19:20,412 --> 00:19:24,753
And you, the unwary victim
of cellular ennui

391
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:28,755
are quite literally...
bored to death.

392
00:19:30,438 --> 00:19:32,306
I never thought about it
that way.

393
00:19:32,343 --> 00:19:35,249
Dr. Bathkin of Andros III
was the first to come up

394
00:19:35,283 --> 00:19:37,413
with the answer
to solving the puzzle of death:

395
00:19:37,456 --> 00:19:39,894
Keep the cells energized.

396
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,091
Keep them in the game

397
00:19:41,132 --> 00:19:44,072
by teaching them
new mitochondrial tricks.

398
00:19:44,107 --> 00:19:46,579
Unfortunately,
before he could finish his work

399
00:19:46,613 --> 00:19:48,881
Dr. Bathkin died
in a shuttle accident.

400
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,085
Or so they say.

401
00:19:52,127 --> 00:19:54,565
And while the soulless
minions of orthodoxy

402
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,594
refuse to follow up
on his important research

403
00:19:56,639 --> 00:20:01,174
I could hear the clarion call
of destiny ringing in my ears.

404
00:20:03,189 --> 00:20:06,322
And now, after 15 years
of tireless effort

405
00:20:06,364 --> 00:20:08,232
after being laughed at

406
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:11,710
and hounded out of the halls of
the scientific establishment...

407
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:14,810
after begging and scrounging
for materials

408
00:20:14,853 --> 00:20:16,756
across half the galaxy...

409
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,229
I have nearly completed work...

410
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,433
on this:

411
00:20:23,475 --> 00:20:29,047
The cellular regeneration...
and entertainment chamber.

412
00:20:30,594 --> 00:20:32,292
What does it do?

413
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:33,996
I'm glad you asked.

414
00:20:34,036 --> 00:20:40,315
It is specially designed
to transmit biogenic energy

415
00:20:40,352 --> 00:20:42,482
on a chromoelectric wavelength

416
00:20:42,525 --> 00:20:47,938
and send uplifting...
and entertaining messages

417
00:20:47,973 --> 00:20:51,106
to the nuclei
of every cell in your body.

418
00:20:51,147 --> 00:20:53,619
Spend eight hours
a day in this machine

419
00:20:53,721 --> 00:20:57,561
and your cells
will never get bored.

420
00:20:57,597 --> 00:20:59,568
You will never grow old...

421
00:20:59,602 --> 00:21:02,370
and most important...

422
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,609
you will never die.

423
00:21:06,453 --> 00:21:08,948
That is the goal of my work...

424
00:21:08,993 --> 00:21:11,659
nothing less
than immortality itself.

425
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:16,373
Excuse us for a moment.

426
00:21:16,413 --> 00:21:17,973
Of course.

427
00:21:26,739 --> 00:21:27,935
What do you think?

428
00:21:27,975 --> 00:21:29,001
I don't know.

429
00:21:29,045 --> 00:21:31,483
I'm no expert
in cellular chemistry

430
00:21:31,518 --> 00:21:34,218
but his theory sounds
a little odd to me.

431
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,355
He had me going there
for a minute

432
00:21:36,398 --> 00:21:38,893
but... a cellular
entertainment machine?

433
00:21:38,938 --> 00:21:40,636
He's crazy, isn't he?

434
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:41,645
Completely.

435
00:21:41,678 --> 00:21:43,238
But he does have
the baseball card.

436
00:21:43,282 --> 00:21:44,215
So?

437
00:21:44,251 --> 00:21:45,220
So, that means

438
00:21:45,254 --> 00:21:46,621
we've got to help him.

439
00:21:46,657 --> 00:21:49,129
I'm not so sure
this is such a good idea.

440
00:21:49,164 --> 00:21:51,432
Nog, I can't let my father down.

441
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,530
Let him down?

442
00:21:52,573 --> 00:21:54,476
Your father doesn't even know
this card exists.

443
00:21:56,183 --> 00:21:58,177
I don't know which of you
is crazier.

444
00:21:58,221 --> 00:22:00,021
I'm not crazy.

445
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:02,155
I'm... just a little obsessed.

446
00:22:02,198 --> 00:22:03,497
"A little"?

447
00:22:03,535 --> 00:22:04,868
Okay, Doctor.

448
00:22:07,712 --> 00:22:09,649
We're in.

449
00:22:11,722 --> 00:22:14,058
Do you how many germs
are transmitted

450
00:22:14,095 --> 00:22:15,394
by a handshake?

451
00:22:15,432 --> 00:22:16,867
You want to kill me?

452
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:18,395
Just nod if we have a deal.

453
00:22:20,545 --> 00:22:22,175
Him, too.

454
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:31,148
Hey, Chief, we need
a neodymium power cell

455
00:22:31,186 --> 00:22:33,316
from a Cardassian
phase-coil inverter.

456
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,692
You think you could help us out?

457
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:36,461
That's an unusual
piece of equipment.

458
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,491
What do you need that for?

459
00:22:37,536 --> 00:22:38,766
We have to trade it for a...

460
00:22:38,806 --> 00:22:40,298
It's kind of a secret.

461
00:22:40,343 --> 00:22:41,505
Well, I'm sure
there's an old cell

462
00:22:41,613 --> 00:22:43,048
lying around here somewhere

463
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:44,177
but I don't have time

464
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,712
to scrounge around for it
at the moment.

465
00:22:45,758 --> 00:22:47,490
What's the matter with you?

466
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:50,526
Just tell him you're trying
to give your father a gift.

467
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:52,939
No! I want it to be a surprise.

468
00:22:52,976 --> 00:22:54,970
You know you can't keep
a secret on this station.

469
00:22:55,015 --> 00:22:57,283
If I tell the Chief, he tells
Keiko, Keiko tells Dax...

470
00:22:57,321 --> 00:22:59,793
But you're not giving him
any reason to help us.

471
00:23:02,535 --> 00:23:05,235
Okay, let me show you
a little something

472
00:23:05,275 --> 00:23:08,511
about incentive-based
economics, huh?

473
00:23:08,616 --> 00:23:11,522
Chief, may I ask you a question?

474
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:12,822
Wouldn't you rather

475
00:23:12,861 --> 00:23:15,095
be doing something
else right now?

476
00:23:15,134 --> 00:23:16,694
Almost anything.

477
00:23:16,738 --> 00:23:18,207
But isn't there
something specific

478
00:23:18,242 --> 00:23:19,837
you'd rather be doing?

479
00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:21,747
Uh... like, uh...

480
00:23:21,784 --> 00:23:23,379
going to the holosuites, maybe?

481
00:23:23,422 --> 00:23:24,391
Sure.

482
00:23:24,424 --> 00:23:26,292
I bet you'd rather
be kayaking right now

483
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,560
wouldn't you?

484
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,574
You probably haven't shot
those rapids in weeks.

485
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,804
No interruptions...

486
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:34,510
no maintenance schedules...

487
00:23:34,551 --> 00:23:37,183
just you and the river.

488
00:23:37,224 --> 00:23:40,026
Hmm... well, that's what
I'd be doing right now

489
00:23:40,064 --> 00:23:41,728
if Decker hadn't gotten sick.

490
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:46,110
But I have to recalibrate
all these EPS regulators

491
00:23:46,147 --> 00:23:47,343
so they don't interfere

492
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,618
with the station's
artificial gravity grid.

493
00:23:49,723 --> 00:23:50,919
What if someone else

494
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,455
recalibrated the regulators
for you, huh?

495
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,440
Someone... like us?

496
00:23:59,114 --> 00:24:00,481
You'd do that for me?

497
00:24:00,518 --> 00:24:01,680
Absolutely!

498
00:24:01,721 --> 00:24:03,385
Don't give it a second thought.

499
00:24:03,426 --> 00:24:05,397
Just go shoot those rapids.

500
00:24:05,431 --> 00:24:07,960
Thanks, thanks a lot.

501
00:24:08,004 --> 00:24:09,564
I owe you one.

502
00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:10,976
Our pleasure, and Chief...

503
00:24:11,012 --> 00:24:13,314
about that power cell?

504
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:15,050
Oh, yeah...

505
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:16,719
I think I know
where there's one.

506
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,594
I'll have it sent up
to your quarters.

507
00:24:18,632 --> 00:24:20,101
Thanks, Chief.

508
00:24:21,506 --> 00:24:22,873
Come on.

509
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,847
You calibrate, I'll scan.

510
00:24:35,742 --> 00:24:37,770
Five liters
of anaerobic metabolites

511
00:24:37,815 --> 00:24:40,379
suspended
in hydrosaline solution.

512
00:24:40,422 --> 00:24:42,792
What could you possibly
want with that?

513
00:24:42,828 --> 00:24:44,822
We can't tell you.

514
00:24:44,866 --> 00:24:46,632
It's a surprise for someone.

515
00:24:46,671 --> 00:24:48,699
They're not going
to drink it, are they?

516
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,143
Oh, no...

517
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,154
At least, I don't know...
is he?

518
00:24:53,188 --> 00:24:54,714
Look, I don't have time
for this.

519
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,092
Uh...

520
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:59,293
Can I ask you one question?

521
00:24:59,337 --> 00:25:02,402
Wouldn't you rather be doing
something else right now?

522
00:25:02,445 --> 00:25:03,573
No.

523
00:25:03,615 --> 00:25:05,313
No?

524
00:25:05,353 --> 00:25:06,617
No. This is the first chance
I've had

525
00:25:06,657 --> 00:25:09,323
to get any research done on my
prion project in five months.

526
00:25:09,363 --> 00:25:11,231
You couldn't drag me
away from here.

527
00:25:11,268 --> 00:25:12,966
Oh.

528
00:25:13,006 --> 00:25:17,313
What Jake is trying to say
is that you seem... unhappy.

529
00:25:17,351 --> 00:25:19,585
I... suppose I have been
feeling a little down

530
00:25:19,624 --> 00:25:20,923
now you come to mention it.

531
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,327
Just out of curiosity

532
00:25:22,364 --> 00:25:24,028
if you had to name one thing

533
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:27,168
that would make you happy
right now, what would it be?

534
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,372
I don't know.

535
00:25:28,413 --> 00:25:29,973
Humor me.
One thing...

536
00:25:30,017 --> 00:25:32,683
anything at all.

537
00:25:32,724 --> 00:25:33,886
Kukalaka.

538
00:25:33,927 --> 00:25:35,021
Excuse me?

539
00:25:35,063 --> 00:25:36,498
That's what I want.

540
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:39,440
Leeta borrowed him...
said he was "cute"...

541
00:25:39,475 --> 00:25:41,446
but she never brought him back.

542
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,847
Kuka-what?

543
00:25:44,054 --> 00:25:45,786
Kukalaka.

544
00:25:45,824 --> 00:25:47,419
You bring him to me

545
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:48,988
and you'll have earned
yourselves

546
00:25:49,032 --> 00:25:52,063
five liters of anaerobic
metabolites suspended

547
00:25:52,107 --> 00:25:53,576
in hydrosaline solution.

548
00:25:53,612 --> 00:25:54,581
Done!

549
00:25:54,614 --> 00:25:56,984
Uh, just one thing, Doctor.

550
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,854
What's a Kukalaka?

551
00:27:07,035 --> 00:27:10,602
Weyoun has made
a startling proposal.

552
00:27:10,645 --> 00:27:13,083
The Dominion wishes to sign

553
00:27:13,118 --> 00:27:16,149
a nonaggression
treaty with Bajor.

554
00:27:16,193 --> 00:27:19,565
They're trying to split Bajor
from the Federation.

555
00:27:19,601 --> 00:27:21,231
Forgive me, Emissary

556
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:23,767
but you've already done that.

557
00:27:23,812 --> 00:27:26,843
It was your advice
six months ago

558
00:27:26,887 --> 00:27:30,123
that kept Bajor
out of the Federation.

559
00:27:30,162 --> 00:27:31,563
How did you put it?

560
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:33,467
"Bajor must stand alone."

561
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:36,272
Well, we are
very much alone now.

562
00:27:36,311 --> 00:27:39,149
Even though you're not a member
of the Federation

563
00:27:39,185 --> 00:27:42,421
Starfleet is committed
to the protection of your world.

564
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:44,295
We're not going to stand
idly by

565
00:27:44,332 --> 00:27:46,462
and watch the Dominion
conquer Bajor.

566
00:27:46,504 --> 00:27:47,803
Can you promise me

567
00:27:47,841 --> 00:27:50,872
that you will not let
one Jem'Hadar soldier

568
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:52,180
set foot on Bajor?

569
00:27:52,219 --> 00:27:54,748
Can you promise me
that you will use

570
00:27:54,792 --> 00:27:57,458
your entire fleet
to protect our planet

571
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,372
even if it means
sacrificing other worlds

572
00:28:00,407 --> 00:28:01,842
like Vulcan

573
00:28:01,878 --> 00:28:03,644
or Andor

574
00:28:03,683 --> 00:28:04,947
or Berengaria...

575
00:28:05,053 --> 00:28:08,118
or perhaps even Earth itself?

576
00:28:08,161 --> 00:28:12,126
I can't make
that kind of promise.

577
00:28:12,171 --> 00:28:14,871
I wouldn't believe you
if you did.

578
00:28:17,184 --> 00:28:19,850
So you see my predicament?

579
00:28:19,891 --> 00:28:22,591
If we ally ourselves
with the Federation

580
00:28:22,632 --> 00:28:24,330
against the Dominion

581
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:28,005
we risk becoming the first
casualty of the next war.

582
00:28:28,113 --> 00:28:31,281
And if you ally yourselves
with the Dominion

583
00:28:31,321 --> 00:28:34,420
you risk becoming
the next conquered world.

584
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:38,165
A most unhappy choice.

585
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:48,866
I have asked
the Prophets to guide me

586
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,706
but they have not
answered my prayers.

587
00:28:52,743 --> 00:28:57,654
I even consulted the Orb
of Wisdom before coming here

588
00:28:57,689 --> 00:29:01,222
and it has told me nothing.

589
00:29:01,266 --> 00:29:03,670
So I come to you, Emissary.

590
00:29:03,704 --> 00:29:06,769
You have heard
the voice of the Prophets.

591
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:08,179
You were sent here

592
00:29:08,217 --> 00:29:10,712
to guide us
through troubled times.

593
00:29:10,757 --> 00:29:13,457
Tell me what to do,
and I will do it.

594
00:29:13,497 --> 00:29:15,867
How can I save Bajor?

595
00:29:15,903 --> 00:29:17,965
You want my advice?

596
00:29:21,618 --> 00:29:23,019
Then, this is it...

597
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:24,524
stall.

598
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,000
Tell Weyoun you have to consult
with the Council of Ministers

599
00:29:28,034 --> 00:29:29,937
or you have to meditate
on your response...

600
00:29:29,972 --> 00:29:32,342
anything you want...
but you have to stall for time.

601
00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:35,353
Time? For what?

602
00:29:35,387 --> 00:29:37,358
I don't know.

603
00:29:37,392 --> 00:29:41,665
But I do know the moment
of crisis isn't here yet

604
00:29:41,703 --> 00:29:44,267
and until that moment arrives

605
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,496
we have to keep
Bajor's options open.

606
00:29:48,235 --> 00:29:51,107
I'm aware that this
is difficult for you

607
00:29:51,142 --> 00:29:53,410
given our past.

608
00:29:53,448 --> 00:29:56,148
But this time,
you have to trust me.

609
00:30:07,517 --> 00:30:10,217
Very well, Emissary.

610
00:30:10,258 --> 00:30:12,856
We put ourselves in your hands.

611
00:30:14,536 --> 00:30:17,008
May we all walk
with the Prophets.

612
00:30:40,938 --> 00:30:42,568
Refreshed...

613
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:44,077
regenerated...

614
00:30:44,113 --> 00:30:45,673
mildly entertained.

615
00:30:45,717 --> 00:30:49,591
I still get a little bored
after the first five hours.

616
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:52,760
I've got half the things
you wanted.

617
00:30:52,802 --> 00:30:54,294
Good, good.

618
00:30:54,339 --> 00:30:56,435
Where's
the hydrosaline solution?

619
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,005
We should have it soon.

620
00:30:58,049 --> 00:30:59,747
Nog just got the bear.

621
00:31:00,857 --> 00:31:02,190
Don't ask.

622
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:04,756
Ah...

623
00:31:14,692 --> 00:31:16,458
Do you know what that is?

624
00:31:16,497 --> 00:31:20,200
It's the sound of immortality.

625
00:31:34,176 --> 00:31:36,910
What's going on down there?

626
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,677
Nog?!

627
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:02,409
Turn that down!

628
00:32:02,449 --> 00:32:03,577
Nog!

629
00:32:03,619 --> 00:32:04,849
I'm working out here!

630
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:06,449
So am I!

631
00:32:06,493 --> 00:32:09,159
I have to listen to all
of Worf's opera recordings

632
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,364
and filter out
the sub-harmonic distortions!

633
00:32:11,406 --> 00:32:12,670
Can you turn that down?!

634
00:32:12,709 --> 00:32:14,680
I'm trying to add a little humor

635
00:32:14,715 --> 00:32:17,780
to Kira's speech
to the Agricultural Delegation!

636
00:32:17,823 --> 00:32:20,591
No! I have to listen
at precisely 82 decibels

637
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:23,296
because that's the volume
Worf listens at.

638
00:32:23,337 --> 00:32:25,399
Of course, if I could
have simply told him

639
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,639
why I needed two meters

640
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:28,843
of electro-plasma conduit
from the <i>Defiant</i>

641
00:32:28,884 --> 00:32:30,718
he probably would have
just given it to me

642
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,885
and things would be a lot
quieter around here!

643
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:35,231
We can't tell anybody, Nog!

644
00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:41,944
Now, listen to this
for a second.

645
00:32:41,985 --> 00:32:44,219
"Thank you
for that kind introduction

646
00:32:44,258 --> 00:32:47,859
"and thank you for inviting me
to address you here tonight.

647
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:49,131
"I've always thought it odd

648
00:32:49,171 --> 00:32:50,697
"that the topic
of water reclamation

649
00:32:50,741 --> 00:32:53,270
was usually treated
as such a dry subject."

650
00:32:54,618 --> 00:32:55,644
Is that funny?

651
00:32:55,687 --> 00:32:56,620
No.

652
00:33:03,307 --> 00:33:05,905
I didn't think so, either.

653
00:33:11,462 --> 00:33:12,761
Would you watch it
with that thing?!

654
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,563
Trying staying out of the way!

655
00:33:20,652 --> 00:33:22,178
He's probably sleeping

656
00:33:22,223 --> 00:33:25,163
in his cellular
entertainment thing again.

657
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:29,571
It's not locked.

658
00:33:52,134 --> 00:33:54,868
No, there is no record
of a Dr. Giger

659
00:33:54,975 --> 00:33:57,003
being assigned
to those quarters.

660
00:33:57,047 --> 00:33:58,711
He was there, Odo.

661
00:33:58,751 --> 00:34:01,246
Maybe the soulless minions
of orthodoxy

662
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:03,057
finally caught up with him.

663
00:34:03,096 --> 00:34:05,534
The who?

664
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:06,833
We don't know who they are

665
00:34:06,872 --> 00:34:08,000
but they were after

666
00:34:08,042 --> 00:34:09,637
Dr. Giger's
cellular regeneration

667
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,943
and entertainment chamber.

668
00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:12,851
His what?

669
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:14,859
It's a device used to keep

670
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,658
the cells in your body
from getting bored.

671
00:34:16,697 --> 00:34:18,395
You see, he was going
to transmit messages

672
00:34:18,435 --> 00:34:20,201
to people's cells

673
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,231
to keep them entertained

674
00:34:21,277 --> 00:34:22,268
so they wouldn't die off

675
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:25,582
and as a result,
these people would...

676
00:34:25,621 --> 00:34:26,920
live forever.

677
00:34:28,796 --> 00:34:30,790
Uh-huh.

678
00:34:33,107 --> 00:34:34,133
Do you really think

679
00:34:34,176 --> 00:34:36,079
he's going to charge us
with filing false reports

680
00:34:36,114 --> 00:34:38,780
obstructing justice,
being public nuisances?

681
00:34:38,822 --> 00:34:40,850
I can't have that
on my Academy record.

682
00:34:40,894 --> 00:34:42,888
I think he was just
trying to scare us.

683
00:34:42,932 --> 00:34:44,960
Nog, look.

684
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,279
It's Kai Winn.

685
00:34:48,313 --> 00:34:50,547
Do you see
who she's talking to?

686
00:34:50,586 --> 00:34:53,184
That's the Vedek
who was bidding against us

687
00:34:53,226 --> 00:34:54,627
at the auction.

688
00:34:54,663 --> 00:34:57,728
Jake, I don't know
what you're thinking

689
00:34:57,771 --> 00:34:59,970
but I'm sure
I'm not going to like it.

690
00:35:00,044 --> 00:35:02,140
Don't you see?

691
00:35:02,182 --> 00:35:03,708
The Vedek was
bidding on that lot

692
00:35:03,754 --> 00:35:06,090
because there was an old
Bajoran mandala in there.

693
00:35:06,126 --> 00:35:08,690
He must have been
working for the Kai.

694
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:12,470
When they lost, the Kai
must have gotten angry

695
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,174
and we all know
how dangerous she is

696
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:15,182
when she's angry.

697
00:35:15,216 --> 00:35:16,515
What are you saying?

698
00:35:16,553 --> 00:35:19,721
That in order to get the
mandala, she kidnapped Giger?

699
00:35:21,064 --> 00:35:22,864
It all makes sense now.

700
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:27,145
Jake, I'm really starting
to worry about you.

701
00:35:27,181 --> 00:35:28,150
Come on.

702
00:35:28,184 --> 00:35:29,244
Where are we going?

703
00:35:29,286 --> 00:35:32,658
Let me introduce you to
a new human expression.

704
00:35:32,695 --> 00:35:35,293
We're going to beard
the lion in its den.

705
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:39,813
Lions, Gigers, bears...

706
00:35:45,662 --> 00:35:47,656
Oh, my.

707
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,050
I hope you've found our talks

708
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,748
as rewarding as I have,
Your Eminence.

709
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:59,558
May I inquire
if you plan on giving

710
00:35:59,598 --> 00:36:03,165
the First Minister
a positive recommendation

711
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:05,338
regarding
the nonaggression pact?

712
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:08,650
I'm afraid I cannot reveal
my recommendations

713
00:36:08,688 --> 00:36:10,157
to the First Minister.

714
00:36:10,192 --> 00:36:11,354
You understand.

715
00:36:11,396 --> 00:36:12,865
Of course, of course.

716
00:36:12,899 --> 00:36:14,870
Forgive me for even asking.

717
00:36:14,904 --> 00:36:16,373
It is enough to know

718
00:36:16,409 --> 00:36:19,873
that you and I have found
so many common interests.

719
00:36:19,917 --> 00:36:22,219
I feel...

720
00:36:22,257 --> 00:36:25,288
that we are very much alike.

721
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:33,081
No, we are nothing alike.

722
00:36:33,118 --> 00:36:34,952
Nothing at all.

723
00:36:48,492 --> 00:36:49,470
What is it, my children?

724
00:36:49,603 --> 00:36:52,337
We need to talk.

725
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:55,043
You accused the Kai
of burglary and kidnapping?!

726
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:57,179
We didn't really
accuse her of anything.

727
00:36:57,223 --> 00:36:58,749
Oh, I see... you just implied it.

728
00:36:58,793 --> 00:36:59,762
Exactly.

729
00:36:59,796 --> 00:37:01,163
Are you trying to be funny,
Cadet?

730
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:02,463
Because I'm not laughing.

731
00:37:02,503 --> 00:37:03,472
No, sir.

732
00:37:03,506 --> 00:37:05,705
I want an explanation
and I want it now.

733
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:07,648
Well, sir, it all began

734
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:09,621
in my Uncle Quark's bar
when we saw this list...

735
00:37:09,655 --> 00:37:10,681
We were in the bar

736
00:37:10,724 --> 00:37:12,695
and I-I guess
we got a little drunk.

737
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,721
Jake!

738
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:16,762
It won't do any good
to lie about it, Nog.

739
00:37:16,807 --> 00:37:17,776
What?!

740
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:20,112
Captain, I would like
to separate myself...

741
00:37:20,149 --> 00:37:21,140
As you were, Cadet.

742
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,394
Drunk.

743
00:37:25,496 --> 00:37:30,771
I see that my faith in the two
of you has sadly been misplaced.

744
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,940
You both are confined
to quarters

745
00:37:32,982 --> 00:37:34,417
until further notice.

746
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:35,819
Dismissed!

747
00:37:39,232 --> 00:37:40,531
What did you say that for?

748
00:37:40,568 --> 00:37:43,200
I didn't want him
to know about the baseball card.

749
00:37:43,242 --> 00:37:44,336
Of course not.

750
00:37:44,378 --> 00:37:46,976
If you tell him about the card
he might forgive us.

751
00:37:47,018 --> 00:37:49,080
He might even be grateful
for all the effort

752
00:37:49,124 --> 00:37:51,323
we've gone through
just to make him happy.

753
00:37:51,363 --> 00:37:52,889
We certainly don't want that.

754
00:37:52,934 --> 00:37:54,164
Habitat Ring.

755
00:37:55,207 --> 00:37:58,409
Once we get the card,
everything will be fine.

756
00:37:58,449 --> 00:38:01,217
Jake, as your friend,
I think I should tell you

757
00:38:01,255 --> 00:38:03,419
you're starting
to go over the edge.

758
00:38:03,462 --> 00:38:06,094
You need to get
some perspective on all this.

759
00:38:06,135 --> 00:38:08,801
You need to get away,
clear your head.

760
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,929
This isn't what I had in mind.

761
00:38:44,534 --> 00:38:46,300
Do you think I'm a fool?

762
00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:52,549
Let's start at the beginning.

763
00:38:52,655 --> 00:38:56,290
What is the nature
of your relationship

764
00:38:56,332 --> 00:38:58,326
with Dr. Elias Giger?

765
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,604
We barely know him.

766
00:39:00,643 --> 00:39:01,737
He had a baseball card

767
00:39:01,779 --> 00:39:04,115
that I wanted to give to
my father to cheer him up.

768
00:39:04,152 --> 00:39:07,524
My father's the Station
Commander, by the way.

769
00:39:07,561 --> 00:39:09,361
I know who your father is.

770
00:39:09,399 --> 00:39:10,959
Go on.

771
00:39:11,004 --> 00:39:12,098
That's it.

772
00:39:12,139 --> 00:39:15,136
We wanted the card,
and so we agreed to help him get

773
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,775
a few things for his research.

774
00:39:16,818 --> 00:39:18,082
We got all the equipment

775
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:20,025
but he disappeared
about three hours ago

776
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,529
and we haven't seen him since.

777
00:39:27,646 --> 00:39:29,446
Do you really expect me
to believe that everything

778
00:39:29,484 --> 00:39:31,512
you've been doing
for the last 22 hours

779
00:39:31,556 --> 00:39:33,356
has been perfectly innocent?

780
00:39:33,394 --> 00:39:35,456
That it was merely a coincidence

781
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,734
that Dr. Giger
has been running experiments

782
00:39:37,772 --> 00:39:39,709
with highly charged
polaric particles

783
00:39:39,745 --> 00:39:41,180
directly below my quarters?

784
00:39:41,215 --> 00:39:44,189
I suppose there's also
an innocent explanation

785
00:39:44,223 --> 00:39:46,160
to the secret meetings
you've been having

786
00:39:46,195 --> 00:39:48,166
with virtually
the entire senior staff

787
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,830
of Deep Space 9

788
00:39:49,871 --> 00:39:54,406
or that Kai Winn met with you
immediately after leaving me?

789
00:39:54,449 --> 00:39:56,648
I suggest that you stop

790
00:39:56,756 --> 00:40:00,493
playing games with me
and tell me the truth...

791
00:40:00,532 --> 00:40:02,162
quickly.

792
00:40:02,202 --> 00:40:04,264
This is all
just a misunderstanding.

793
00:40:04,308 --> 00:40:05,868
Nothing's going on

794
00:40:05,912 --> 00:40:08,646
and we're certainly not involved
in some secret plot against...

795
00:40:16,073 --> 00:40:17,839
You betrayed me.

796
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:21,409
You turned me over to these
soulless minions of orthodoxy.

797
00:40:21,453 --> 00:40:23,253
Well, they won't discover

798
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:25,091
the secret of my work
without a...

799
00:40:27,936 --> 00:40:29,098
fight.

800
00:40:32,715 --> 00:40:34,777
So...

801
00:40:36,158 --> 00:40:38,630
there are secrets after all.

802
00:40:41,471 --> 00:40:45,436
There shouldn't be any secrets
between friends, Jake

803
00:40:45,482 --> 00:40:48,456
and I do want
to be your friend.

804
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:50,084
Do something.

805
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,566
All right.

806
00:40:56,845 --> 00:40:59,249
We'll tell you the truth.

807
00:40:59,285 --> 00:41:00,845
I'm listening.

808
00:41:02,459 --> 00:41:04,897
We weren't supposed
to divulge this

809
00:41:04,933 --> 00:41:07,839
but since
you left us no choice...

810
00:41:10,747 --> 00:41:12,775
we're working
for Starfleet Intelligence.

811
00:41:12,886 --> 00:41:14,048
Oh, no.

812
00:41:14,089 --> 00:41:15,889
Forget about it, Nog.

813
00:41:15,927 --> 00:41:17,226
We have to tell him.

814
00:41:19,503 --> 00:41:20,802
We're investigating the man

815
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,811
whose picture
is in your hand right now.

816
00:41:22,845 --> 00:41:26,810
Until yesterday, that man...
one Willie Mays...

817
00:41:26,856 --> 00:41:29,853
did not exist
in any historical documents.

818
00:41:31,534 --> 00:41:35,408
Then, in the blink of an eye,
that card appeared

819
00:41:35,444 --> 00:41:36,538
on the station.

820
00:41:36,581 --> 00:41:39,851
And at that same moment,
a bust of Willie Mays appeared

821
00:41:39,922 --> 00:41:42,520
at the Hall of Fame
in Cooperstown, New York.

822
00:41:42,563 --> 00:41:44,659
There's only one explanation.

823
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:48,166
We suspect that this man...

824
00:41:48,211 --> 00:41:50,581
is from the future.

825
00:41:50,618 --> 00:41:52,316
A time-traveler?

826
00:41:52,355 --> 00:41:53,483
That's right.

827
00:41:53,525 --> 00:41:58,232
And so far, that card
is the only link we have to him.

828
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,570
We must find out

829
00:41:59,607 --> 00:42:02,581
what he's planning
to do in the past

830
00:42:02,615 --> 00:42:04,586
or what he may
have done already.

831
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,987
We need that card.

832
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:10,091
The entire future of the galaxy
may depend

833
00:42:10,135 --> 00:42:14,806
on us tracking down Willie Mays
and stopping him.

834
00:42:21,531 --> 00:42:23,399
I believe you.

835
00:42:23,436 --> 00:42:25,532
You do?

836
00:42:25,574 --> 00:42:27,169
Yes.

837
00:42:28,182 --> 00:42:30,085
That is,
I believe your first story...

838
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,250
that you're two innocent boys

839
00:42:32,292 --> 00:42:34,992
trying to give a gift
to Captain Sisko.

840
00:42:37,238 --> 00:42:38,764
You are very wise.

841
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:41,248
Which still leaves
the question...

842
00:42:41,283 --> 00:42:44,280
what you were doing
beneath my quarters.

843
00:42:44,323 --> 00:42:45,656
He's harmless.

844
00:42:45,694 --> 00:42:49,227
He's just working on a way
to become immortal.

845
00:42:49,269 --> 00:42:50,670
Really?

846
00:42:50,707 --> 00:42:54,148
I have a background in...
shall we say, creative genetics.

847
00:42:54,182 --> 00:42:57,247
I'd be most interested
in hearing your theories.

848
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:59,819
Well, it may take
some time to explain.

849
00:43:01,401 --> 00:43:04,934
Let me ask you
a simple question.

850
00:43:04,977 --> 00:43:07,073
Do you want to die?

851
00:43:07,116 --> 00:43:09,280
Uh, excuse me.

852
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:10,449
Can we go?

853
00:43:10,491 --> 00:43:12,121
Of course.

854
00:43:12,162 --> 00:43:13,894
Thank you.

855
00:43:13,934 --> 00:43:16,270
Aren't you
forgetting something?

856
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:26,359
Captain's Log, Stardate 50929.4.

857
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,306
Two days ago,
this station felt like a tomb.

858
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,243
I'd never seen
so many of my crew

859
00:43:31,278 --> 00:43:32,645
depressed at the same time.

860
00:43:32,683 --> 00:43:36,386
But for some reason, it now
seems as though a new spirit

861
00:43:36,426 --> 00:43:38,021
has swept through the station

862
00:43:38,096 --> 00:43:39,565
as if someone had opened a door

863
00:43:39,601 --> 00:43:44,045
and let a gust of fresh air
blow through a musty old house.

864
00:43:44,112 --> 00:43:46,914
Why this is happening,
frankly, is a mystery to me.

865
00:43:46,952 --> 00:43:49,322
After all,
nothing has really changed.

866
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,057
The Dominion is still a threat

867
00:43:51,163 --> 00:43:52,758
the Cardassians
are still threatening

868
00:43:52,801 --> 00:43:54,669
to retake the station,
and I can still see

869
00:43:54,706 --> 00:43:56,974
the clouds of war
gathering on the horizon.

870
00:43:57,012 --> 00:43:59,248
So why do I sense a new-found
sense of optimism in the air?

871
00:43:59,248 --> 00:44:00,217
So why do I sense a new-found
sense of optimism in the air?

872
00:44:00,251 --> 00:44:03,089
But maybe I'm
overthinking this.

873
00:44:03,124 --> 00:44:05,358
Maybe the real explanation
is as simple

874
00:44:05,397 --> 00:44:08,530
as something my father
taught me a long time ago.

875
00:44:08,572 --> 00:44:11,978
Even in the darkest moments,
you can always find something

876
00:44:12,014 --> 00:44:14,110
that'll make you smile.
