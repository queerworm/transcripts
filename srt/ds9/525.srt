1
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,773
Did you hear
about the<i> Tian An Men?</i>

2
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,232
She was reported
missing last night

3
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,651
near the Cardassian
border.

4
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,402
That's three
in the last three weeks.

5
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,154
At this rate, we're going
to run out of ships.

6
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,364
Well, that's not funny.

7
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:31,448
It wasn't meant to be.

8
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,617
Unless
Starfleet Command

9
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,285
actually starts
doing something

10
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,788
about the Dominion
threat, the situation's

11
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,039
only going
to get worse.

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,375
Well, what do
you want, Julian,

13
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,877
a war?

14
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:44,920
What<i> I</i> want
is to talk about something else.

15
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:47,214
Chief...

16
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,799
what about
Kirayoshi?

17
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,049
Is he walking yet?

18
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,927
No.

19
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:53,929
Not yet, no.

20
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,807
Odo, I understand

21
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:59,685
you're going
to Bajor next week.

22
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,896
Do you plan
to see Dr. Mora?

23
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:05,232
Uh... actually,
I've canceled my trip.

24
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:08,276
There's been
a 75 percent jump

25
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,779
in the theft
of medical supplies

26
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,114
and food rations
on DS9.

27
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,868
I haven't seen such
an increase since...

28
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,412
Since?

29
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:24,585
Since just before
the Cardassians were forced

30
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,461
to abandon
the station.

31
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:29,924
On that note,

32
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:31,967
I think
I'll turn in.

33
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,220
Oh, me, too.

34
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,889
Thank you for dinner, Captain.

35
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:38,432
It was wonderful.

36
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,975
It was my pleasure.

37
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,476
Sir.

38
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,478
Good night, everyone.

39
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,815
Mr. Worf.

40
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,150
You've been paroled.

41
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,277
The party's over.

42
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,948
Thank you, sir.

43
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,199
Good night.

44
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:00,871
Don't bother.

45
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,247
I'll clean the rest up later.

46
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,415
I want to be alone for a while.

47
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,708
Go on.

48
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,752
Okay.

49
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:08,211
Good night, sir.

50
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,138
(<i> beeping</i> )

51
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,223
OPS OFFICER:
Ops to Captain Sisko.

52
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,892
Go ahead.

53
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,769
OPS OFFICER: We just received
a message from Bajor, sir.

54
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,938
Kai Winn will be coming
to the station tomorrow morning,

55
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:28,065
and she'd like to meet with you.

56
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,984
Acknowledged.

57
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,448
Thanks for
the invitation, Jake.

58
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,784
<i>That</i> was a lot of fun.

59
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,410
Did you see
how down my dad was?

60
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,703
He tried to hide it,

61
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,122
but I could tell
he was depressed.

62
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:44,456
He's not the only one.

63
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,749
Look around.

64
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,459
There's something
in the air.

65
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,836
People are scared.

66
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,337
Yeah, but he's
usually the one

67
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,171
who tries to lift
everyone's spirits.

68
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:54,173
I mean, people go to him
for encouragement.

69
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,718
Where does he go
when<i> he</i> needs it?

70
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,429
I hope I'll be seeing
the two of you tomorrow

71
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,472
at 1200 hours.

72
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:01,849
Why?

73
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,851
Why?
Haven't you heard?

74
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,602
There's going
to be an auction

75
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,729
of some of the
galaxy's rarest

76
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,815
and most valuable
antiquities.

77
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:13,568
Here. Find
something you like

78
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,987
and make a bid
with all that latinum

79
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,864
you've got stashed
under your bed.

80
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,365
Shh!

81
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:22,327
Oh, Nog, you don't really
keep it under your bed?

82
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,955
No, of course not.

83
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,957
Where'd you get
all this stuff, Quark?

84
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:30,752
I'm just conducting the auction
for a modest commission.

85
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,379
The items
up for sale

86
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,256
were all aboard
an old derelict freighter

87
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:39,094
that the Bajorans found adrift
about a light-year from here.

88
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:42,263
The cargo hold was crammed
with valuable items

89
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,974
of every
description:

90
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,393
Antiques, paintings, vehicles.

91
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:49,270
It's all a bunch of junk.

92
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,065
Listen to some
of this stuff.

93
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:55,402
A mid-24th century,
ceramic Romulan water basin--

94
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,862
slightly cracked.

95
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,405
A pair
of Tellarite shoes--

96
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,865
date unknown.

97
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,367
A mid-20th century
hu-man baseball card.

98
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,911
A Tholian pedestal--

99
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,871
A baseball card!

100
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,831
A mint condition, 1951

101
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,833
Willie Mays rookie card!

102
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,085
Nog, this is it!

103
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:12,044
What do you mean?

104
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,378
It's perfect.

105
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,589
This is how I can
cheer up my dad.

106
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,841
You know how much
he loves baseball.

107
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,760
He'll go nuts when he sees this.

108
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,970
Tell him to be here
at 1200 hours,

109
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,890
and he can bid
along with everyone else.

110
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,475
No.
<i>I'm</i> going to bid on this.

111
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,936
He's always doing things for me.

112
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,896
I want to do something for him
for a change.

113
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,397
And this is it.

114
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,400
All I have to do
is get him this card.

115
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,277
How hard can that be?

116
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:40,942
Come on, Nog.

117
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:41,985
No.

118
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:42,986
Why not?

119
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,238
It's<i> my</i> money, Jake.

120
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,280
If you want to bid
at the auction,

121
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,698
use your own money.

122
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,950
I'm human--
I don't<i> have</i> any money.

123
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,328
It's not my fault
your species decided

124
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,663
to abandon
currency-based economics

125
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,249
in favor of
some philosophy

126
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,415
of self-enhancement.

127
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:57,876
Hey, watch it.

128
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,087
There's nothing wrong
with our philosophy.

129
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,420
We work
to better ourselves

130
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,797
and the rest of humanity.

131
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,883
What does that mean exactly?

132
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,885
It means...

133
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,346
it means
we don't need money.

134
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,724
Well, if you don't need money,

135
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,768
then you certainly
don't need mine.

136
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:20,148
How much latinum do you have?

137
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,484
How much?

138
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,570
Five bars.

139
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,406
Five bars!

140
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:29,950
Look, it's taken me a lifetime
to save up that much money,

141
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,869
and I'm not just going to throw
it away for some baseball card.

142
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,338
Not even for my father--

143
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,048
the man who made it possible

144
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,301
for you to enter
Starfleet Academy?

145
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,470
Oh, no.
That's not fair.

146
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,056
The man who believed in you
when no one else would.

147
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,725
Oh, this
is<i> so</i> low.

148
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,019
I can't believe you'd rather
keep your filthy money

149
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,147
locked up in a box
under a bed

150
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:04,025
than use it to give him
endless moments of happiness.

151
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,777
(<i> screams</i> )

152
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,154
All right!
All right!

153
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,030
I'll do it.

154
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,866
That's very generous of you,
Nog.

155
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,368
I'm proud of you.

156
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,703
Now, let's get that money.

157
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,414
Hu-mans.

158
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,930
(<i> door chimes</i> )

159
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,265
Come in.

160
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,936
Welcome back
to Deep Space 9,

161
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,229
Your Eminence.

162
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,231
Thank you, Emissary.

163
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,275
You may go now, child.

164
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,821
Thank you.

165
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,535
Why don't
we take a walk?

166
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,371
A walk?

167
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:58,872
Yes.
Would you mind?

168
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,750
SISKO:
Something wrong, Eminence?

169
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,127
No, nothing wrong,

170
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,963
but there was a shop
down there, as I recall--

171
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:10,133
a woman who sold
Bajoran tapestries and antiques.

172
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,135
Ah. Kandra Vilk.

173
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,428
Yes.

174
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,680
I believe she moved
to a neutral world

175
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,141
near the Cordon system
about two months ago.

176
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,479
So many people have
left Deep Space 9

177
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,605
in the last few months.

178
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,774
I'm sure there are times
when you must feel

179
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,110
as if you're
being abandoned here.

180
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,611
Forgive me, Eminence,

181
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:33,365
but I have a very
busy day ahead of me.

182
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:39,162
I'm here to meet
a representative
of the Dominion.

183
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,039
To what end?

184
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,916
I... I don't know.

185
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,502
This meeting is being
held at their request.

186
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,254
You disapprove?

187
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,796
I'm concerned.

188
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:52,467
The Dominion is notorious
for its political intrigue.

189
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:57,638
Well, I have some experience
in that area, as well.

190
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,020
This is a delicate
moment for Bajor.

191
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,232
This conflict between the
Federation and the Dominion

192
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:11,152
could escalate into open
warfare at any moment.

193
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,113
A misstep now could result

194
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,949
in the destruction
of our world.

195
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,869
For once, I am
in complete agreement with you.

196
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,538
You have my word

197
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,165
I will do whatever it takes
to safeguard Bajor.

198
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,918
Walk with the Prophets.

199
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,019
QUARK:
The bid is to you, sir--

200
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,938
one bar, three strips.

201
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,941
Don't let the lady
steal this fine example

202
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,611
of post-Eventualistic,
pre-Matoian

203
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:55,947
bronze and triptin sculpture
for such a pittance.

204
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,908
One bar, three strips.

205
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,328
One bar, four strips,
and it's all yours--

206
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,996
an honorable addition

207
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,372
to any
Klingon household.

208
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,999
Remember...

209
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,959
all the proceeds
from this auction

210
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,211
go to the Bajoran
War Orphans Fund...

211
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,838
minus a modest commission.

212
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,966
Think of those poor,
lonely children

213
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,344
and how much your latinum
will mean to them.

214
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,721
Looks like the kids
will have to make do

215
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,390
with one bar, three strips.

216
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,685
Sold to the blue man
in the good shoes.

217
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,729
(<i> smattering of applause</i> )

218
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,231
Lot 48.

219
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,899
An Andorian chest

220
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,569
containing a pre-Surak
Vulcan bracelet,

221
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:37,071
a sixth-century
Bajoran mandala,

222
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,407
a 23rd century
ion-transtator,

223
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,618
a Willie Mays
baseball card

224
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:44,703
from Earth,
dated 1951.

225
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:47,123
Who will start
the bidding with one bar

226
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,583
of gold-pressed latinum?

227
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,917
One bar.

228
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,294
One bar.

229
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,129
Do I hear one bar, five strips?

230
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,383
One bar, five strips.

231
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,551
Do I hear one bar, ten?

232
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,677
Don't worry.

233
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:00,303
He'll drop out
at two bars.

234
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,888
How do you know that?

235
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,181
I'm still a Ferengi.

236
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,182
One bar, ten.

237
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,933
One bar, ten.

238
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,185
One, 15?

239
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,771
One, 15.
One, 20?

240
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:12,982
One, 20.

241
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,192
One, 25?

242
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,360
Two bars.

243
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,612
The bid
is two bars.

244
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:20,781
Do I hear
two bars, five?

245
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:21,949
Vedek, are you in?

246
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,369
I told you.

247
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,287
Two bars, five.

248
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,497
Three bars.

249
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,251
Four bars.

250
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,252
Jake.

251
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,628
Ten bars.

252
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,673
The bid
is<i> ten</i> bars

253
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,383
of gold-pressed latinum.

254
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,009
Is there another bid?

255
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,720
What do we do now?

256
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,179
Nothing.
We're out of money.

257
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,305
QUARK:
Jake,

258
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,390
do you want to make another bid?

259
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:53,147
Sold to the gentleman
sitting in the aisle.

260
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,942
Lot 49.

261
00:12:55,942 --> 00:13:01,364
A rare example of a 20th-century
human art form--

262
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,324
acrylic on black velvet.

263
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,993
This image was the inspiration

264
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:10,081
for the flag of the Martian
Colony in the 22nd....

265
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,878
Look, I-I-I know
you wanted that card,

266
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,505
but we lost it, okay?

267
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,758
So let's come up
with something else

268
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,635
to cheer up your dad, huh?

269
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,844
Uh... like a new pair
of shoes.

270
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:24,971
Shoes?

271
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,514
What's wrong with shoes?

272
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,015
Nothing, except it's stupid.

273
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,892
I want to give
my dad something

274
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,894
that'll bring a little
joy into his life.

275
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,980
Something special.

276
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,691
I'm telling you, that
baseball card is the answer.

277
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,025
It's kismet.

278
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,527
"Kiss you"?

279
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,028
Kismet-- fate.

280
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,530
Destiny.

281
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,408
I was<i> meant</i> to give
that card to my father.

282
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:49,036
Jake, I think you're taking
this whole baseball card thing

283
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,705
way too seriously.

284
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,457
It's not the card.

285
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:53,916
It's my dad.

286
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,629
This is very important to me.

287
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:59,547
My father's never let me down.

288
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,425
He's always been there for me
when I needed him,

289
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,844
and right now,
he needs me.

290
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,597
I don't want to let him down.

291
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:11,810
Nog, please.

292
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,770
Let's get that card.

293
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,356
(<i> sighs</i> )

294
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,191
All right.

295
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,859
What do you want to do?

296
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:28,827
Sir.

297
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,036
Excuse me.

298
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,163
Sir? Could we talk
to you for a minute?

299
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,206
Who sent you?

300
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,749
No one.

301
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,668
We wish to discuss
a business transaction.

302
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:37,836
Not interested.

303
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,587
You don't even know
what it is yet.

304
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,464
We just want to buy
the baseball card.

305
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,590
Listen to me.

306
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,008
I haven't done anything wrong,

307
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,635
and I won't be hounded by you

308
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,428
and your soulless minions
of orthodoxy.

309
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,848
I haven't broken any laws,

310
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:51,974
except, perhaps,
the laws of nature...

311
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,645
so stay away from me.

312
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,650
Habitat Ring.

313
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,541
Captain Sisko!

314
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,878
I can't tell you how happy
I am to see you again.

315
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,379
I wish I could say the same.

316
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,130
(<i> laughs</i> )

317
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,841
How delightful!

318
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,967
You feel comfortable enough
around me to make jokes.

319
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,388
I'm so pleased to see
our relationship evolving

320
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,390
beyond
the stale adversarial stage.

321
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,309
No, it's not, but before you
twist<i> that</i> into a compliment,

322
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,604
let me be blunt:
I don't like the Dominion.

323
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,523
I don't like what it stands for,
and I don't like you.

324
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,692
So let's dispense
with the hollow pleasantries

325
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,193
and stick to business.

326
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,986
I can't tell you how it pains me

327
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,781
to hear you say that, Captain.

328
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:52,368
You see, I really<i> like</i>
Deep Space 9 and I like<i> you,</i>

329
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,245
and after this meeting
with Kai Winn,

330
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:57,874
I think you and I will be seeing
a lot more of each other.

331
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:08,968
Jake... Jake!

332
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,304
He wants to see us!

333
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,055
Who?
Dr. Giger--

334
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,223
the man who bought
the baseball card.

335
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,475
He wants us
to come to his quarters.

336
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,685
He says he's willing
to make a deal.

337
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,686
You're kidding.

338
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,187
No. He left
a message for us

339
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,689
about an hour ago.

340
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,316
It said to meet him
at 1800 hours.

341
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,526
That's in ten minutes.
Let's go.

342
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,700
Remember-- let<i> me</i>
do the talking.

343
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,952
You?!

344
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:35,870
You had your chance
on the Promenade.

345
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,330
Now, stand aside

346
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,081
and let a professional
handle this.

347
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:46,756
(<i> equipment buzzing</i>
<i>and beeping</i> )

348
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:57,224
Step out of the doorway, please,

349
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,434
and don't touch anything.

350
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,561
This is very
sensitive equipment.

351
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,527
I did some checking on you two.

352
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,612
It turns out that you are
the Station Commander's son

353
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,071
and you are the
nephew of the man

354
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,072
who owns the bar.

355
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,033
That's right.

356
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,743
Since you are not, in fact,

357
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,371
working for the soulless minions
of orthodoxy

358
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,040
that have hounded my work
and plagued my existence,

359
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,960
I have decided to open
negotiations regarding the sale

360
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,253
of a mint condition
1951 Willie Mays

361
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,548
rookie card--
without the original

362
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,174
packaging or chewing gum.

363
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,718
Excellent.
We would like to open

364
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,594
the negotiations
with a bid--

365
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,346
The card is not for sale.

366
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:36,639
What?!

367
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:37,640
But you just said--

368
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,893
I am willing to trade the card

369
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,978
in exchange for
the following items.

370
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,944
"Two liters of anaerobic
metabolites suspended

371
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,988
"in a hydrosaline
solution...

372
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,656
a neodymium
power cell..."

373
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,616
Where are we supposed
to get all this stuff?

374
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,037
Surely
the Station Commander's son

375
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:00,538
and a promising
young cadet

376
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:01,915
have access
to a wide variety

377
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,457
of equipment and supplies

378
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,043
that would not be available
to someone like myself.

379
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:07,045
It's a very long list.

380
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,546
It'll take
some doing.

381
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:09,964
Wait a minute.

382
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,549
What are you planning
to do with these things?

383
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:12,967
Nog...

384
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,595
Look, we can't start
delivering equipment

385
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,221
and medical supplies to you

386
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,348
without knowing what you're
going to do with them.

387
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,434
Very well, young man.

388
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,064
Let me ask you both
a simple question.

389
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,985
Do you want to die?

390
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,028
No.

391
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,362
Not really.

392
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,948
Of course you don't.
So why should you?

393
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,909
Why should any of us end up
as putrefying corpses

394
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,744
in wooden boxes
stuck in the ground?

395
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,789
Or vaporized
into subatomic particles

396
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:46,084
and vented into the cosmos
like a bad case of gas?

397
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,836
No reason that I can think of.

398
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:54,884
I have devoted my life...
to the study of death,

399
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,928
and do you know
what I found?

400
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:59,055
Death is nothing more
than the result

401
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,390
of cellular boredom.

402
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,309
"Boredom?"

403
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,310
Think about it.

404
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,394
The cells
in your body

405
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,896
have been doing the same job--

406
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,690
the same dull,
monotonous routine

407
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,985
every day
since you were conceived:

408
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,152
Metabolize, divide,

409
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,112
metabolize, divide.

410
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,195
Wouldn't you
get bored?

411
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,405
Of course you would.

412
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,491
So, at some point,
the cells just say

413
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,951
"That's it."

414
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:24,371
And you, the unwary victim
of cellular ennui,

415
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:28,084
are quite literally...
bored to death.

416
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,587
I never thought about it
that way.

417
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:32,922
Dr. Bathkin

418
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,674
of Andros III was
the first to come up

419
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,843
with the answer
to solving the puzzle of death:

420
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,970
Keep the cells energized.

421
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,471
Keep them in the game

422
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:43,474
by teaching them new
mitochondrial tricks.

423
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,977
Unfortunately,
before he could finish his work,

424
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:48,146
Dr. Bathkin died
in a shuttle accident.

425
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,398
Or so they say.

426
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,901
And while the soulless
minions of orthodoxy

427
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,945
refuse to follow up on
his important research,

428
00:19:55,945 --> 00:20:00,616
I could hear the clarion call
of destiny ringing in my ears.

429
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:05,705
And now, after 15 years
of tireless effort,

430
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,832
after being laughed at

431
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:11,002
and hounded out of the halls of
the scientific establishment...

432
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:14,380
after begging and scrounging
for materials

433
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,174
across half the galaxy...

434
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:18,634
I have nearly completed work...

435
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,930
on this:

436
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:28,268
The cellular regeneration...
and entertainment chamber.

437
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,605
What does it do?

438
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,566
I'm glad you asked.

439
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:39,655
It is specially designed
to transmit biogenic energy

440
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,741
on a chromoelectric wavelength

441
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:47,371
and send uplifting...
and entertaining messages

442
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,332
to the nuclei
of every cell in your body.

443
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,002
Spend eight hours
a day in this machine,

444
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,212
and your cells

445
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:56,881
will never get bored.

446
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,883
You will never grow old...

447
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:01,594
and most important...

448
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,304
you will never die.

449
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:08,392
That is the goal of my work--

450
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,395
nothing less
than immortality itself.

451
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,649
Excuse us for a moment.

452
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,110
Of course.

453
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:26,827
What do you think?

454
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,162
I don't know.

455
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:30,664
I'm no expert
in cellular chemistry,

456
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,375
but his theory sounds
a little<i> odd</i> to me.

457
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,711
He had me going there
for a minute,

458
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,047
but... a cellular
entertainment machine?

459
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,882
He's crazy, isn't he?

460
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,092
Completely.

461
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:42,468
But he does have
the baseball card.

462
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,803
So?

463
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,763
So, that means
we've got to help him.

464
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,432
I'm not so sure
this is such a good idea.

465
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,684
Nog, I can't let my father down.

466
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,228
Let him down?

467
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:53,729
Your father doesn't even know
this card exists.

468
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:57,357
I don't know which of you
is crazier.

469
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,193
I'm not crazy.

470
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,195
I'm... just a
little obsessed.

471
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,696
"A little"?

472
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,906
Okay, Doctor.

473
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,702
We're in.

474
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,249
Do you how many germs
are transmitted

475
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:14,500
by a handshake?

476
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,043
You want
to kill me?

477
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,628
Just nod if we have a deal.

478
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,215
Him, too.

479
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,517
JAKE:
Hey, Chief, we need
a neodymium power cell

480
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,435
from a Cardassian
phase-coil inverter.

481
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,812
You think you could
help us out?

482
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,605
That's an unusual
piece of equipment.

483
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:37,690
What do you
need that for?

484
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,858
We have to trade
it for a--

485
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,567
It's kind of a secret.

486
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,694
Well, I'm sure
there's an old cell

487
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,196
lying around here
somewhere,

488
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:44,530
but I don't have time

489
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,739
to scrounge around for it
at the moment.

490
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,491
What's the matter
with you?

491
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,451
Just tell him
you're trying

492
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,703
to give your
father a gift.

493
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,997
No! I want it
to be a surprise.

494
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:55,082
You know you can't keep
a secret on this station.

495
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,459
If I tell the Chief, he tells
Keiko, Keiko tells Dax--

496
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:00,420
But you're not giving him
any reason to help us.

497
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,467
Okay, let me show you
a little something

498
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,679
about incentive-based
economics, huh?

499
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:11,557
Chief, may I ask you
a question?

500
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,600
Wouldn't you rather

501
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,393
be doing something
else right now?

502
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:16,645
(<i> scoffing</i> ):
Almost anything.

503
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,647
But isn't there
something specific

504
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,940
you'd rather
be doing?

505
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,734
Uh... like, uh...

506
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,277
going to the
holosuites, maybe?

507
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:24,653
Sure.

508
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,113
I bet you'd rather
be kayaking right now,

509
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,698
wouldn't you?

510
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:30,659
You probably haven't shot
those rapids in weeks.

511
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,786
No interruptions...

512
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,580
no maintenance
schedules...

513
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,333
just you and the river.

514
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,044
Hmm... well, that's what
I'd be doing right now

515
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:41,754
if Decker hadn't
gotten sick.

516
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:46,342
But I have to recalibrate
all these EPS regulators,

517
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,760
so they don't interfere

518
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,762
with the station's
artificial gravity grid.

519
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,389
What if someone else

520
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:53,974
recalibrated the
regulators for you, huh?

521
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,518
Someone... like us?

522
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,273
You'd do that for me?

523
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:01,481
Absolutely!

524
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,525
Don't give it
a second thought.

525
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,443
Just go shoot
those rapids.

526
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,988
Thanks, thanks a lot.

527
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,489
I owe you one.

528
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,866
Our pleasure,
and, Chief...

529
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,160
about that
power cell...?

530
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,995
Oh, yeah...

531
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,663
I think I know
where there's one.

532
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,582
I'll have it sent up
to your quarters.

533
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,084
Thanks, Chief.

534
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:21,459
(<i> chuckling</i> )

535
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:22,795
(<i> sighing</i> ):
Come on.

536
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,256
You calibrate,
I'll scan.

537
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,977
Five liters
of anaerobic metabolites

538
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,813
suspended
in hydrosaline solution.

539
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:43,065
What could you possibly
want with that?

540
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:45,025
We can't tell you.

541
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,944
It's a surprise
for someone.

542
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,904
They're not going
to drink it, are they?

543
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,239
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
Oh, no...

544
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,284
At least, I don't
know-- is he?

545
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:56,494
Look, I don't have time
for this.

546
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:57,455
Uh...

547
00:24:57,455 --> 00:24:59,581
Can I ask you one question?

548
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,626
Wouldn't you rather be doing
something else right now?

549
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,752
No.

550
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,421
No?

551
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,256
No. This is the first chance
I've had

552
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,633
to get any research done on my
prion project in five months.

553
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,427
You couldn't drag me
away from here.

554
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:13,053
Oh.

555
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:17,641
What Jake is trying to say
is that you seem... unhappy.

556
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,768
I... suppose I have been
feeling a little down,

557
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,103
now you come to mention it.

558
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,480
Just out of
curiosity,

559
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,106
if you had to name one thing

560
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:27,276
that would make you happy
right now, what would it be?

561
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:28,444
I don't know.

562
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,196
Humor me.
One thing--

563
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:32,823
anything at all.

564
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:34,074
Kukalaka.

565
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,117
Excuse me?

566
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:36,743
That's what I want.

567
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,830
Leeta borrowed him--
said he was "cute"--

568
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,539
but she never brought him back.

569
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,833
Kuka-what?

570
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,919
Kukalaka.

571
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,505
You bring him to me,

572
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:49,089
and you'll have earned
yourselves

573
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:52,218
five liters of anaerobic
metabolites suspended

574
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:53,677
in hydrosaline solution.

575
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:54,678
Done!

576
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,056
Uh, just one thing, Doctor.

577
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,016
What's a Kukalaka?

578
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:12,089
Weyoun has made
a startling proposal.

579
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,466
The Dominion wishes to sign

580
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:16,051
a nonaggression
treaty with Bajor.

581
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:19,513
They're trying to split Bajor
from the Federation.

582
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,098
Forgive me, Emissary,

583
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,850
but you've already
done that.

584
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,937
It was your advice
six months ago

585
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:29,982
that kept Bajor
out of the Federation.

586
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,649
How did you put it?

587
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,360
"Bajor must
stand alone."

588
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,113
Well, we<i> are</i>
very much alone now.

589
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:38,449
Even though you're not a member
of the Federation,

590
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:41,952
Starfleet is committed
to the protection of your world.

591
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,829
We're not going to stand
idly by

592
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,415
and watch the Dominion
conquer Bajor.

593
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:47,874
Can you promise me

594
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,794
that you will not let
one Jem'Hadar soldier

595
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,045
set foot on Bajor?

596
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,590
Can you promise me
that you will use

597
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,384
your entire fleet
to protect our planet,

598
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:00,304
even if it means
sacrificing other worlds

599
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:01,721
like Vulcan

600
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,390
or Andor

601
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,933
or Berengaria...

602
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,894
or perhaps even Earth itself?

603
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:11,940
I can't make
that kind of promise.

604
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,818
I wouldn't believe you
if you did.

605
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,865
So you see my predicament?

606
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,284
If we ally ourselves
with the Federation

607
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,119
against the Dominion,

608
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,831
we risk becoming the first
casualty of the next war.

609
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:31,084
And if you ally yourselves
with the Dominion,

610
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:34,296
you risk becoming
the next<i> conquered</i> world.

611
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:37,883
A most unhappy choice.

612
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:48,894
I have asked the
Prophets to guide me,

613
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:52,648
but they have not
answered my prayers.

614
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:57,695
I even consulted the Orb
of Wisdom before coming here,

615
00:28:57,695 --> 00:29:01,031
and it has told me nothing.

616
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:03,617
So I come to you, Emissary.

617
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:06,370
You have heard
the voice of the Prophets.

618
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,871
You were sent here

619
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,416
to guide us through
troubled times.

620
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:13,252
Tell me what to do,
and I will do it.

621
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,671
How can I save Bajor?

622
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,797
You want my advice?

623
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:22,469
Then, this is it--

624
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,263
stall.

625
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:27,933
Tell Weyoun you have to consult
with the Council of Ministers

626
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,851
or you have to meditate
on your response--

627
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,145
anything you want--
but you have to stall for time.

628
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:35,107
Time? For what?

629
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,025
I don't know.

630
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:41,405
But I<i> do</i> know the moment
of crisis isn't here yet,

631
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:43,949
and until that moment arrives,

632
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:46,993
we have to keep
Bajor's options open.

633
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:51,415
I'm aware that this
is difficult for you

634
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,792
given our past.

635
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,170
But this time,
you have to trust me.

636
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,850
Very well, Emissary.

637
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,145
We put ourselves in your hands.

638
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,274
May we all walk
with the Prophets.

639
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:21,320

644
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,929
I still get
a little bored

645
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,889
after the first
five hours.

646
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:53,185
I've got half the things
you wanted.

647
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,770
Good, good.

648
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,855
Where's
the hydrosaline solution?

649
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,357
We should have it soon.

650
00:30:58,357 --> 00:30:59,941
Nog just got the bear.

651
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,528
Don't ask.

652
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:04,946
Ah...

Do you know what that is?

It's the sound of immortality.

668

669
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,765
Can you turn that down?!

670
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:15,058
I'm trying to add

to Kira's speech
to the Agricultural Delegation!

672
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,939
No! I have to listen
at precisely 82 decibels,

673
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,734
because that's the volume
Worf listens at.

674
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:25,318
Of course, if I could
have simply told him

675
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,779
why I needed two meters

676
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,988
of electro-plasma conduit
from the<i> Defiant,</i>

677
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:31,116
he probably would have
just given it to me

678
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,034
and things would be a lot
quieter around here!

679
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,287
We can't tell anybody, Nog!

being assigned
to those quarters.

00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,745
He was there, Odo.

701
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,122
Maybe the soulless minions
of orthodoxy

702
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,124
finally caught up with him.

We don't know who they are,

from getting bored.

to people's cells

714
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,227
to keep them entertained
so they wouldn't die off,

715
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:25,271
and as a result,
these people would...

716
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,732
live forever.

00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,610

he's going to charge us

00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:42,664
I think he was just
trying to scare us.

723
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,750
Nog, look.

724
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:48,003
NOG:
It's Kai Winn.

725
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:49,170
JAKE:
Do you see

726
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,714
who she's talking to?

727
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:52,925
That's the Vedek who
was bidding against us

728
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:54,467
at the auction.

729
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,554
Jake, I don't know
what you're thinking,

730
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,890
but I'm sure
I'm not going to like it.

731
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,100
Don't you see?

732
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,685
The Vedek was
bidding on that lot,

733
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,979
because there was an old
Bajoran mandala in there.

734
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:08,523
He must have been
working for the Kai.

735
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,859
When they lost,
the Kai

736
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,360
must have gotten angry,

737
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,820
and we all know
how dangerous she is

738
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,905
when she's angry.

739
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:16,448
What are you saying?

740
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:19,451
That in order to get the
mandala, she kidnapped Giger?

741
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:22,788
It all makes sense now.

742
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:24,247
(<i> sighs</i> )

743
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:27,084
Jake, I'm really starting
to worry about you.

744
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:28,085
Come on.

745
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:29,586
Where are we going?

746
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:32,464
Let me introduce you to
a new human expression.

747
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:35,216
We're going to beard
the lion in its den.

748
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,718
(<i> sighs</i> )

749
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:39,721
Lions, Gigers, bears...

750
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,431
(<i> sighs</i> )

751
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,562
Oh, my.

752
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,860
I hope you've
found our talks

753
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,488
as rewarding as I have,
Your Eminence.

754
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:59,491
May I inquire if
you plan on giving

755
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,828
the First Minister
a positive recommendation

756
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:05,330
regarding the
nonaggression pact?

757
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,500
I'm afraid I cannot reveal
my recommendations

758
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,002
to the First Minister.

759
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:10,961
You understand.

760
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:12,671
Of course, of course.

761
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,714
Forgive me for even asking.

762
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,299
It is enough to know

763
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:19,719
that you and I have found
so many common interests.

764
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,055
I feel...

765
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:24,933
that we are very much alike.

766
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:32,899
No, we are nothing alike.

767
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,567
Nothing at all.

768
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,000
What is it, my children?

769
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,045
We need to talk.

770
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:54,171
You accused the Kai

771
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:55,714
of burglary
and kidnapping?!

772
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,883
We didn't really
<i>accuse</i> her of anything.

773
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:59,300
Oh, I see-- you
just implied it.

774
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,552
Exactly.

775
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:01,720
Are you trying
to be funny, Cadet?

776
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,013
Because I'm
not laughing.

777
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:04,097
No, sir.

778
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:05,098
I want an
explanation,

779
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:06,183
and I want it<i> now.</i>

780
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:08,101
Well, sir, it all began

781
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:10,145
in my Uncle Quark's bar
when we saw this list--

782
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:11,563
We were in the bar,

783
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:12,772
and I-I guess
we got a little drunk.

784
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,191
Jake!

785
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:17,235
It won't do any good
to lie about it, Nog.

786
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,403
What?!

787
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:19,404
Captain, I would like

788
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:20,572
to separate
myself--

789
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:21,656
As you were, Cadet.

790
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:26,078
Drunk.

791
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:31,124
I see that my faith in the two
of you has sadly been misplaced.

792
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:33,376
You both are confined
to quarters

793
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,878
until further notice.

794
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:36,295
Dismissed!

795
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:40,967
What did you say that for?

796
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,219
I didn't want him

797
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:43,678
to know about
the baseball card.

798
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,846
Of course not.

799
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,305
If you tell him
about the card,

800
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,724
he might forgive us.

801
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,184
He might even be grateful
for all the effort

802
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,476
we've gone through
just to make him happy,

803
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,979
and we certainly
don't want<i> that.</i>

804
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,355
Habitat Ring.

805
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,400
Once we get the card,

806
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,027
everything
will be fine.

807
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:01,780
Jake, as your friend,
I think I should tell you

808
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,032
you're starting
to go over the edge.

809
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,992
You need to get
some perspective on all this.

810
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,619
You need to get away,

811
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,246
clear your head.

812
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,546
This isn't
what I had in mind.

813
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,491
Do you think I'm a fool?

814
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,831
Let's start at the beginning.

815
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:56,417
What is the nature
of your relationship

816
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,628
with Dr. Elias Giger?

817
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,588
We barely know him.

818
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,174
He had a baseball card

819
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:04,467
that I wanted to give to
my father to cheer him up.

820
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:07,804
My father's the Station
Commander, by the way.

821
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:09,639
I know who your father is.

822
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,224
Go on.

823
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:12,267
That's it.

824
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,685
We wanted the card,

825
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,353
and so we agreed
to help him get

826
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,813
a few things
for his research.

827
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:18,273
We got all
the equipment,

828
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:20,192
but he disappeared
about three hours ago

829
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:21,860
and we haven't
seen him since.

830
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:29,659
Do you really expect me
to believe that everything

831
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:31,786
you've been doing
for the last 22 hours

832
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,663
has been perfectly innocent?

833
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,832
That it was merely a coincidence

834
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:37,625
that Dr. Giger
has been running experiments

835
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,252
with highly charged
polaric particles

836
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:41,546
directly below my quarters?

837
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:44,090
I suppose there's also
an innocent explanation

838
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,343
to the secret meetings
you've been having

839
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:48,427
with virtually
the entire senior staff

840
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,055
of Deep Space 9,

841
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,973
or that Kai Winn
met with you

842
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:54,642
immediately after leaving me?

843
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,895
I suggest
that you stop

844
00:39:56,895 --> 00:40:00,732
playing games with me
and tell me the truth...

845
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:02,359
quickly.

846
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:04,236
This is all
just a misunderstanding.

847
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:06,196
Nothing's going on,

848
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:08,907
and we're certainly not involved
in some secret plot against--

849
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:17,999
You betrayed me.

850
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,001
You turned me over
to these

851
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,460
soulless minions of orthodoxy.

852
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,421
Well, they
won't discover

853
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,090
the secret of my work
without a...

854
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:29,094
fight.

855
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,974
So...

856
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:38,811
there are secrets after all.

857
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:45,360
There shouldn't be any secrets
between friends, Jake,

858
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,819
and I do want

859
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,613
to be your friend.

860
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,240
Do something.

861
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,535
All right.

862
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:59,332
We'll tell you
the truth.

863
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01,000
I'm listening.

864
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,963
We weren't supposed
to divulge this,

865
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,799
but since
you left us no choice...

866
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,971
we're working
for Starfleet Intelligence.

867
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,055
Oh, no.

868
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,974
Forget
about it, Nog.

869
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,142
We have to tell him.

870
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,979
We're investigating the man

871
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:22,897
whose picture
is in your hand right now.

872
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,566
Until yesterday,
that man--

873
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,985
one Willie Mays--

874
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,904
did not exist
in any historical documents.

875
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,739
(<i> sighs</i> )

876
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,409
Then, in the blink of an eye,

877
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:35,493
that card appeared

878
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,661
on the station.

879
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:37,829
And at that
same moment,

880
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,831
a bust of Willie
Mays appeared

881
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:42,708
at the Hall of Fame
in Cooperstown, New York.

882
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,710
There's only one explanation.

883
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:48,214
We suspect that this man...

884
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,675
is from the future.

885
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,260
A time-traveler?

886
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,303
That's right.

887
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:55,430
And so far, that card

888
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,308
is the only link
we have to him.

889
00:41:58,308 --> 00:41:59,642
We must find out

890
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,520
what he's planning
to do in the past

891
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,605
or what he may
have done already.

892
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,940
We need that card.

893
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,069
The entire future of the galaxy
may depend

894
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:14,866
on us tracking down Willie Mays
and stopping him.

895
00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:23,416
I believe you.

896
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,543
You do?

897
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,296
Yes.

898
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:30,215
That is,
I believe your first story--

899
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:32,133
that you're
two innocent boys

900
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:35,011
trying to give a gift
to Captain Sisko.

901
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:38,639
You are very wise.

902
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,393
Which still leaves
the question--

903
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:44,312
what you were doing
beneath my quarters.

904
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:45,980
NOG:
He's harmless.

905
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,524
He's just
working on a way

906
00:42:47,524 --> 00:42:49,401
to become immortal.

907
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:51,027
Really?

908
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:54,239
I have a background in...
shall we say, creative genetics.

909
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:57,283
I'd be most interested
in hearing your theories.

910
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,994
Well, it may take
some time to explain.

911
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:05,041
Let me ask you
a simple question.

912
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:07,126
Do you want to die?

913
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,212
NOG:
Uh, excuse me.

914
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:10,422
Can we go?

915
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:12,090
Of course.

916
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,133
Thank you.

917
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,219
WEYOUN:
Aren't you
forgetting something?

918
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:26,396
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 50929.4.</i>

919
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:29,315
<i>Two days ago,</i>
<i>this station felt like a tomb.</i>

920
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,608
<i>I'd never seen</i>
<i>so many of my crew</i>

921
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,444
<i>depressed at the same time.</i>

922
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:36,448
<i>But for some reason it now</i>
<i>seems as though a new spirit</i>

923
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:38,157
<i>has swept through the station,</i>

924
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,451
<i>as if someone had opened a door</i>

925
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:41,035
<i>and let a gust of fresh air</i>

926
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,496
<i>blow through</i>
<i>a musty old house.</i>

927
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:46,916
<i>Why this is happening,</i>
<i>frankly, is a mystery to me.</i>

928
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:49,419
<i>After all,</i>
<i>nothing has really changed.</i>

929
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:50,920
<i>The Dominion is still a threat,</i>

930
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,505
<i>the Cardassians</i>
<i>are still threatening</i>

931
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:54,424
<i>to retake the station,</i>
<i>and I can still see</i>

932
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:56,842
<i>the clouds of war</i>
<i>gathering on the horizon.</i>

933
00:43:56,842 --> 00:44:00,472
<i>So why do I sense a new-found</i>
<i>sense of optimism in the air?</i>

934
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:03,391
<i>But maybe I'm</i>
<i>overthinking this.</i>

935
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,518
<i>Maybe the real explanation</i>
<i>is as simple</i>

936
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:08,563
<i>as something my father</i>
<i>taught me a long time ago.</i>

937
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:12,233
<i>Even in the darkest moments,</i>
<i>you can always find something</i>

938
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:14,360
<i>that'll make you smile.</i>
