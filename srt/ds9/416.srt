1
00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:13,523
Department heads

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,032
prepare reports
for tomorrow's briefing.

3
00:00:16,067 --> 00:00:18,197
All hands dismissed.

4
00:00:18,306 --> 00:00:20,368
I'd say that was
a successful mission.

5
00:00:20,412 --> 00:00:23,716
Five days in the Gamma Quadrant
and no sign of the Jem'Hadar.

6
00:00:23,753 --> 00:00:25,724
Commander...
during our maneuvers

7
00:00:25,758 --> 00:00:28,230
through that asteroid belt
on the Kar-telos system

8
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:30,896
I noticed the <i>Defiant</i>
felt a little... sluggish

9
00:00:30,938 --> 00:00:32,806
when turning hard aport.

10
00:00:32,843 --> 00:00:34,473
The inertial
dampening generators

11
00:00:34,514 --> 00:00:35,813
may need to be realigned.

12
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:38,255
I'll begin drawing up
a schedule immediately.

13
00:00:38,358 --> 00:00:40,796
And while we're at it,
we should recalibrate

14
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:43,703
the targeting scanners
and check the EPS relays.

15
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,767
O'Brien's going to be
a little disappointed.

16
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,648
He thought he finally
had the ship running smoothly.

17
00:00:48,685 --> 00:00:51,214
Well, Chief O'Brien
has done an excellent job.

18
00:00:51,258 --> 00:00:52,922
This is a fine ship.

19
00:00:52,963 --> 00:00:55,527
But it is my duty
to keep her functioning

20
00:00:55,569 --> 00:00:57,301
at peek proficiency.

21
00:00:57,341 --> 00:00:59,813
Mister Worf... you're in love.

22
00:01:01,117 --> 00:01:02,781
With the <i>Defiant.</i>

23
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:04,917
You exaggerate...

24
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,794
as usual.

25
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:21,625
I feel silly.

26
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,402
I like it.

27
00:01:23,441 --> 00:01:25,139
It shows off your legs.

28
00:01:25,179 --> 00:01:28,017
There you see...
your public has spoken.

29
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:29,684
Have fun.

30
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:32,664
What do you call this holosuite
program of yours again?

31
00:01:32,699 --> 00:01:34,329
The Battle of Clontarf...

32
00:01:34,403 --> 00:01:37,001
you, me and a thousand
stalwart Irish warriors

33
00:01:37,043 --> 00:01:39,173
against a ravening
hoard of Vikings.

34
00:01:39,215 --> 00:01:41,015
It's like the Battle of Britain

35
00:01:41,053 --> 00:01:42,352
only with swords.

36
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:44,693
How come you get
to be High King?

37
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,867
I am a direct descendant
of King Brian Boru.

38
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,070
Besides...

39
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:51,546
it's my program.

40
00:01:51,581 --> 00:01:53,745
I suppose that's only fair.

41
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:12,193
Oh...

42
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:17,908
I know exactly how you feel.

43
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:22,721
The Bajoran Time of Cleansing.

44
00:02:22,762 --> 00:02:25,394
Can someone explain to me
why the Bajorans need

45
00:02:25,435 --> 00:02:27,406
to abstain
from worldly pleasures

46
00:02:27,508 --> 00:02:29,376
for an entire month?

47
00:02:29,413 --> 00:02:32,353
I mean, it's not like
they're a bunch of hedonistic

48
00:02:32,387 --> 00:02:34,825
holosuite-obsessed drunkards
to begin with.

49
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,365
No use moaning about it.

50
00:02:38,403 --> 00:02:40,431
It hurts.

51
00:02:40,474 --> 00:02:41,841
Who's that for?

52
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,109
Me.

53
00:02:43,149 --> 00:02:45,451
It's one of Moogie's
home remedies.

54
00:02:45,487 --> 00:02:47,253
Your ear?

55
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,318
Again?

56
00:02:50,835 --> 00:02:52,806
That's disgusting.

57
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,973
You want to drive away
all the rest of my customers?

58
00:02:56,015 --> 00:02:57,314
I feel dizzy.

59
00:02:57,351 --> 00:02:59,481
What else is new?

60
00:02:59,524 --> 00:03:01,962
Go wait on table seven.

61
00:03:01,997 --> 00:03:03,432
Rom, you look terrible.

62
00:03:03,468 --> 00:03:05,200
I think you better lie down.

63
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:06,869
I don't pay you to think.

64
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,881
I pay you to spin
the dabo wheel.

65
00:03:08,915 --> 00:03:10,350
So get spinning.

66
00:03:10,385 --> 00:03:12,015
But nobody's gambling.

67
00:03:12,057 --> 00:03:14,461
How can they when you're not
at the wheel?

68
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,090
I really don't feel good.

69
00:03:16,134 --> 00:03:17,194
Can't you see he's sick?

70
00:03:17,237 --> 00:03:19,367
He needs to lie down.

71
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:20,969
Just because you happen to be

72
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:24,477
intimately acquainted with
Dr. Bashir's bedside manner

73
00:03:24,556 --> 00:03:26,892
doesn't make you
a medical expert.

74
00:03:26,929 --> 00:03:29,493
Brother, am I still standing?

75
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:33,876
What I do during my time off
is no business of yours.

76
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:36,443
If you don't get back
to work this instant

77
00:03:36,487 --> 00:03:38,789
you're going to have
more time off

78
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:41,026
than you know what to do with.

79
00:03:41,065 --> 00:03:42,865
The same goes for you.
Here.

80
00:03:42,903 --> 00:03:44,202
Yes, Brother.

81
00:03:49,454 --> 00:03:51,983
Aren't you going
to do something?

82
00:03:52,027 --> 00:03:54,226
Of course,
I'm going to do something.

83
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:56,568
I'm going to dock his pay.

84
00:03:59,179 --> 00:04:02,347
Briok, clean up this mess.

85
00:04:04,727 --> 00:04:06,891
Oh...

86
00:06:05,838 --> 00:06:09,108
Oh, this is one
stubborn infection.

87
00:06:09,147 --> 00:06:11,141
How long have you had it?

88
00:06:11,186 --> 00:06:13,385
Uh, a couple of weeks.

89
00:06:13,425 --> 00:06:15,259
You mean to tell me
you've been walking around

90
00:06:15,297 --> 00:06:17,735
with a seeping infection
of the tympanic membrane

91
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:19,170
for two weeks?

92
00:06:19,207 --> 00:06:20,871
More like three, actually.

93
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,508
Rom! You could have died.

94
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:24,747
Another 48 hours

95
00:06:24,788 --> 00:06:26,452
and you would have been
bidding for a new life

96
00:06:26,491 --> 00:06:27,551
at the Divine Treasury.

97
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,999
I guess it's a good thing
I fainted when I did.

98
00:06:30,034 --> 00:06:31,766
Why didn't you come
and see me sooner?

99
00:06:31,806 --> 00:06:33,640
I couldn't.
I was busy.

100
00:06:33,677 --> 00:06:34,737
I'm sure your brother

101
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,808
could have spared you
for half an hour.

102
00:06:36,852 --> 00:06:39,222
It would have been
a violation of my contract...

103
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:41,754
paragraph 76, subsection three.

104
00:06:41,798 --> 00:06:44,600
"Employees of Quark's Bar
and Holding Company

105
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,077
"are strictly prohibited from
leaving the work environment

106
00:06:47,112 --> 00:06:48,081
"during business hours

107
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:50,485
"unless ordered to do so
by their employer.

108
00:06:50,521 --> 00:06:53,255
"Any failure to comply
with this provision

109
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:56,666
will result in severe fines
and possible dismissal."

110
00:06:56,704 --> 00:07:00,305
It's a standard provision
in all Ferengi labor contracts.

111
00:07:00,346 --> 00:07:02,978
You mean, you don't get time off

112
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,455
even if you're sick?

113
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,427
It's all part of our...

114
00:07:06,462 --> 00:07:09,230
generous employee
compensation package.

115
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,572
"No sick days, no vacations

116
00:07:11,608 --> 00:07:13,238
no paid overtime."

117
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,775
It sounds to me like
you need a better contract.

118
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,221
There's no such thing.

119
00:07:17,256 --> 00:07:19,626
All Ferengi labor
contracts are the same.

120
00:07:19,663 --> 00:07:22,431
Well, that should do it.

121
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:23,565
But I want you to see me

122
00:07:23,607 --> 00:07:25,806
first thing in the morning
for a follow-up.

123
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:27,976
It'll have to be
before the bar opens.

124
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:30,514
What you people need is a union.

125
00:07:30,558 --> 00:07:32,426
A what?

126
00:07:32,463 --> 00:07:34,229
You know, a trade guild

127
00:07:34,268 --> 00:07:36,832
a collective bargaining
association, a union...

128
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,310
something to keep you
from being exploited.

129
00:07:38,345 --> 00:07:40,145
You don't understand.

130
00:07:40,183 --> 00:07:42,917
Ferengi workers don't want
to stop the exploitation.

131
00:07:42,957 --> 00:07:46,193
We want to find a way
to become the exploiters.

132
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,964
Suit yourself.

133
00:07:48,004 --> 00:07:50,533
But I don't see you
exploiting anyone.

134
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,806
Rom... how'd it go?

135
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:04,814
I'm okay.

136
00:08:04,848 --> 00:08:06,215
Oh. Julian's a wonderful doctor.

137
00:08:06,251 --> 00:08:08,485
Your brother should have
let you see him weeks ago.

138
00:08:08,523 --> 00:08:10,015
It's not Quark's fault
that I got sick.

139
00:08:10,061 --> 00:08:12,329
I forgot to get
my bimonthly ear scan.

140
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,670
And besides, I've probably
been getting too much <i>oo-mox.</i>

141
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:17,977
Really?
Who's the lucky female?

142
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:20,453
No female. Just me.

143
00:08:20,488 --> 00:08:22,322
I'm...

144
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:24,023
sorry.

145
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,835
Sorry enough to do
something about it?

146
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:30,471
I... don't think
Julian would approve.

147
00:08:30,514 --> 00:08:32,678
We could ask him.

148
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,349
All right, everyone...

149
00:08:34,391 --> 00:08:35,724
gather around.

150
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:37,025
What now?

151
00:08:37,064 --> 00:08:39,536
I have an announcement
to make.

152
00:08:39,571 --> 00:08:42,373
I've just been going over
today's receipts

153
00:08:42,412 --> 00:08:44,042
and it's not good.

154
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:45,985
The only thing this Bajoran

155
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,518
Cleansing Ritual has cleansed
is my profit margin.

156
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:52,229
So, starting tomorrow

157
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,711
everyone's salary
gets cut by a third.

158
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,648
No, no, that's not fair.
I'll talk to him.

159
00:08:58,687 --> 00:09:00,088
It's either that

160
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:02,220
or fire half the staff.

161
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:05,570
Don't bother thanking me.

162
00:09:05,605 --> 00:09:07,097
I can't afford a pay cut.

163
00:09:07,142 --> 00:09:09,944
It's either
a pay cut or a layoff.

164
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,316
You decide.

165
00:09:11,353 --> 00:09:14,657
All right, everyone,
let's get back to work.

166
00:09:14,695 --> 00:09:16,325
I want this place cleaned up

167
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:18,303
and the lights off
in ten minutes.

168
00:09:18,338 --> 00:09:20,070
Brother...
this isn't right.

169
00:09:20,109 --> 00:09:22,046
You can't just cut
people's salaries

170
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:23,345
without warning.

171
00:09:23,384 --> 00:09:24,910
Actually, I can.

172
00:09:24,954 --> 00:09:26,754
And I have.

173
00:09:26,793 --> 00:09:28,764
Now, why don't you concentrate

174
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:31,169
on keeping your hands
off your lobes

175
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:33,438
and leave the business
matters to me.

176
00:09:33,477 --> 00:09:35,881
But once the Cleansing
Ritual is over

177
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:38,446
you'll restore
everyone's salary, right?

178
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,122
That depends on next
quarter's fiscal summation.

179
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,499
Brother, I'm asking you...

180
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,635
as a personal favor
to reconsider this pay cut.

181
00:09:46,678 --> 00:09:48,376
Anything for you.

182
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:51,351
Um...

183
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:53,487
There.

184
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:55,159
I've reconsidered it.

185
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,533
My decision stands.

186
00:09:56,604 --> 00:09:57,299
But, Brother...

187
00:09:57,339 --> 00:09:59,503
Don't "Brother" me.

188
00:09:59,545 --> 00:10:02,017
In this bar,
you're not my brother.

189
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:03,543
You're my employee.

190
00:10:03,655 --> 00:10:06,025
And employees have no right
to question

191
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:07,691
the management's decisions.

192
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,202
I'm warning you.

193
00:10:09,236 --> 00:10:11,504
If you don't rescind
the pay cuts...

194
00:10:11,543 --> 00:10:13,207
you're going to regret it.

195
00:10:13,247 --> 00:10:15,981
The only thing I regret

196
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:18,927
is not being an only child.

197
00:10:27,718 --> 00:10:28,982
You know, I think I'm finally

198
00:10:29,021 --> 00:10:30,513
getting the hang
of this <i>mek'leth.</i>

199
00:10:30,558 --> 00:10:31,527
Don't you think?

200
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:32,894
It would seem so.

201
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:34,093
Then why haven't you told me?

202
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,103
A Klingon warrior

203
00:10:35,137 --> 00:10:37,005
does not need the
praise of his teacher.

204
00:10:37,042 --> 00:10:38,740
I'm not a Klingon warrior.

205
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:41,445
I'm a beautiful
and sensitive young woman

206
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:42,581
who thrives on...

207
00:10:43,592 --> 00:10:44,993
What is it?

208
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:46,259
Listen.

209
00:10:57,428 --> 00:10:58,692
Do not move.

210
00:10:58,731 --> 00:11:00,429
Worf?

211
00:11:02,174 --> 00:11:04,270
Isn't this your tooth sharpener?

212
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:17,269
This <i>p'tak</i> just
robbed my quarters.

213
00:11:17,313 --> 00:11:18,748
Take him to a holding cell.

214
00:11:20,087 --> 00:11:21,249
I'll need a statement.

215
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,486
And you will have one.

216
00:11:22,526 --> 00:11:24,690
But what I want to know is
how such a security breach

217
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,702
was allowed to occur
in the first place!

218
00:11:26,804 --> 00:11:28,570
Unfortunately,
these things happen.

219
00:11:28,609 --> 00:11:30,979
They did not happen
on the <i>Enterprise.</i>

220
00:11:32,352 --> 00:11:34,516
Really.

221
00:11:34,558 --> 00:11:36,426
Well, let me see.

222
00:11:38,402 --> 00:11:41,467
"Stardate 46235.7.

223
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:45,247
"Ferengi privateers,
led by DaiMon Lurin, boarded

224
00:11:45,286 --> 00:11:47,588

225
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,758

228
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,655

230
00:12:04,803 --> 00:12:06,329
Shall I continue?

231
00:12:06,373 --> 00:12:08,037
That will not be necessary.

232
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:10,277
I know these incidents
are the exception

233
00:12:10,318 --> 00:12:13,383
rather than the rule,
but if security breaches

234
00:12:13,426 --> 00:12:17,334
like these could happen on
the flagship of the Federation

235
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:20,035
imagine the difficulty
of maintaining security

236
00:12:20,076 --> 00:12:22,104
at an open port such as DS9.

237
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:23,413
I understand.

238
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:26,449
It is just that I find it...

239
00:12:26,492 --> 00:12:27,984
irritating.

240
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,660
So do I.

241
00:12:29,701 --> 00:12:32,641
But I'm afraid you're just
going to have to get used to it.

242
00:12:35,783 --> 00:12:37,811
Attention, please.

243
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:39,324
Thank you all for coming.

244
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:42,458
I know that in the past,
I've always defended my brother

245
00:12:42,501 --> 00:12:45,634
whenever he's taken a stance
that's proven unpopular

246
00:12:45,676 --> 00:12:46,838
with the staff.

247
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:50,713
But I'm not going
to do that today.

248
00:12:50,755 --> 00:12:52,385
You're not?

249
00:12:52,427 --> 00:12:53,953
No. I'm not.

250
00:12:53,997 --> 00:12:57,403
Quark's just using
the Cleansing Ritual...

251
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,739
to increase his profits

252
00:12:58,776 --> 00:12:59,870
at our expense.

253
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,609
It isn't fair.

254
00:13:02,653 --> 00:13:04,921
And we're not going to take it.

255
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:05,529
Since when?

256
00:13:05,662 --> 00:13:07,029
Since... right now.

257
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:09,334
So what are we
going to do about it?

258
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:13,109
We're going to fight back
in the only way we can.

259
00:13:13,148 --> 00:13:15,882
We're going to form a...

260
00:13:17,793 --> 00:13:19,319
a...

261
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:21,829
A what?

262
00:13:21,871 --> 00:13:24,400
We're going to form...

263
00:13:26,684 --> 00:13:28,484
a union.

264
00:13:37,412 --> 00:13:38,608
Are you insane?

265
00:13:38,648 --> 00:13:42,146
You've just destroyed the lives
of every Ferengi in this room.

266
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:45,757
When the FCA finds out we've
even been talking of a...

267
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,928
a...

268
00:13:46,969 --> 00:13:48,199
A union.

269
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:49,834
Don't say that word again.

270
00:13:49,877 --> 00:13:51,871
We're in enough trouble
as it is.

271
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:55,619
The Ferengi Commerce Authority
doesn't have to hear about this.

272
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:57,425
If we all go back to work now

273
00:13:57,464 --> 00:13:59,834
no one else has to know
this ever happened.

274
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,738
No, no!
It's too late for that.

275
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:03,678
The FCA has ears everywhere.

276
00:14:03,713 --> 00:14:06,151
As soon as their lobes
get wind of this

277
00:14:06,186 --> 00:14:07,280
we're all doomed!

278
00:14:08,826 --> 00:14:10,922
All right!

279
00:14:10,965 --> 00:14:13,095
So we're doomed.

280
00:14:13,138 --> 00:14:15,166
FCA liquidators
will probably haunt us

281
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:16,610
for the rest of our lives.

282
00:14:16,646 --> 00:14:20,144
But I say if they're
going to come after us

283
00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:22,457
let's give them a good reason.

284
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:26,905
Every one of you...
Ferengi and non-Ferengi alike...

285
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,846
knows that the way
Quark treats us is unfair.

286
00:14:29,881 --> 00:14:32,011
Frool, don't you
deserve a day off

287
00:14:32,053 --> 00:14:34,081
when your back starts acting up?

288
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,153
Well, uh... I suppose.

289
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:37,292
And Grimp...

290
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:39,965
wouldn't you like
to take a paid vacation?

291
00:14:40,007 --> 00:14:41,476
You're being ridiculous.

292
00:14:41,511 --> 00:14:42,639
Answer the question.

293
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,241
It's not going to happen!

294
00:14:44,285 --> 00:14:45,880
It won't happen

295
00:14:45,922 --> 00:14:48,018
unless you make it happen.

296
00:14:48,062 --> 00:14:49,429
We're Ferengi!

297
00:14:49,465 --> 00:14:51,835
And when a Ferengi
sees an opportunity

298
00:14:51,872 --> 00:14:53,638
what does he do?

299
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:54,975
He seizes it?

300
00:14:55,013 --> 00:14:56,346
That's right!

301
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,583
And I, for one,
intend to grab it.

302
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:03,294
We've been exploited
long enough.

303
00:15:03,401 --> 00:15:05,805
It's time to be strong.

304
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:07,903
Take control of our lives.

305
00:15:07,946 --> 00:15:09,974
Our dignity

306
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:12,457
and our profits!

307
00:15:12,492 --> 00:15:13,483
Yes!

308
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:15,761
Strike a blow against Quark.

309
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,860
Yes.

310
00:15:16,903 --> 00:15:18,737
Strike a blow against the FCA.

311
00:15:18,775 --> 00:15:19,801
Yes!

312
00:15:19,843 --> 00:15:22,007
Strike a blow
against exploitation!

313
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,349
Yes!

314
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,152
Are you with me?

315
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:26,558
Yes!

316
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:27,688
Union!

317
00:15:27,731 --> 00:15:31,764
Union! Union! Union! Union!

318
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:35,376
What you have there
is a sebaceous cyst.

319
00:15:35,484 --> 00:15:37,888
I know it's a cyst,
but it's getting bigger.

320
00:15:37,924 --> 00:15:39,120
There's nothing to worry about.

321
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,154
Dermatologically speaking,
you're perfectly healthy.

322
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,194
Oh, I'm perfectly healthy
except I've got

323
00:15:43,238 --> 00:15:45,266
a disgusting cyst
on the back of my neck.

324
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,406
Now either I paint a nose,
eyes and mouth on it

325
00:15:47,483 --> 00:15:48,850
and pretend I've got two heads

326
00:15:48,886 --> 00:15:49,855
or you take it off.

327
00:15:49,888 --> 00:15:51,414
Well, I'll get you some paint.

328
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,259
Julian, get it off me!

329
00:15:53,297 --> 00:15:54,732
All right, all right.

330
00:15:54,768 --> 00:15:58,232
But you know what they say:
Two heads are better than one.

331
00:15:58,277 --> 00:15:59,405
Julian, I'm waiting.

332
00:16:01,285 --> 00:16:03,085
Dr. Bashir

333
00:16:03,123 --> 00:16:04,387
I'm glad you're in.

334
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,656
I need your help.

335
00:16:05,696 --> 00:16:07,063
Is that ear acting up again?

336
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,069
My ear's fine.

337
00:16:08,102 --> 00:16:09,697
I need some advice about...

338
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,731
unions.

339
00:16:10,776 --> 00:16:11,938
Unions.

340
00:16:11,979 --> 00:16:14,976
You said the other day
I should form a union, so I did.

341
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:17,619
Rom, I was speaking
theoretically.

342
00:16:17,661 --> 00:16:19,791
And I've put
your theory into practice.

343
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,397
All of Quark's employees
have joined.

344
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,934
We're going to force Quark
to treat us better...

345
00:16:24,979 --> 00:16:26,346
I hope.

346
00:16:26,383 --> 00:16:27,647
A union, huh?

347
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:28,656
Good for you.

348
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:30,181
You know about unions?

349
00:16:30,227 --> 00:16:33,167
Who do you think led
the Pennsylvania coal miners

350
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,730
during the anthracite
strike of 1902?

351
00:16:35,774 --> 00:16:37,073
I have no idea.

352
00:16:37,111 --> 00:16:39,345
Sean Aloysius O'Brien.

353
00:16:39,383 --> 00:16:40,875
I didn't know that.

354
00:16:40,921 --> 00:16:44,327
There's a lot of things
about my family you don't know.

355
00:16:44,363 --> 00:16:46,391
11 months those mines
were closed

356
00:16:46,435 --> 00:16:47,995
and they didn't open again

357
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:50,443
until all the miners'
demands were met.

358
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:53,510
You mean, we should force
Quark to close the bar.

359
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,023
Only as a last resort.

360
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:57,325
If he's reasonable
about your requests

361
00:16:57,363 --> 00:16:58,923
there's no need to strike.

362
00:16:58,968 --> 00:17:00,528
Quark reasonable?

363
00:17:00,572 --> 00:17:01,471
Ha!

364
00:17:01,575 --> 00:17:02,942
Unlikely.

365
00:17:02,978 --> 00:17:05,450
You'll have to strike...
mark my words...

366
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:08,150
and when you do,
you'll have to be strong.

367
00:17:08,191 --> 00:17:10,355
Just like Sean O'Brien.

368
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:11,423
Exactly.

369
00:17:11,467 --> 00:17:13,495
You know, he had
the biggest funeral

370
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:15,373
in all of western Pennsylvania.

371
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,210
Funeral?

372
00:17:17,249 --> 00:17:20,519
Hmm. They fished his body
out of the Allegheny River

373
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,754
a week before the strike ended.

374
00:17:22,796 --> 00:17:24,767
32 bullets he had in him.

375
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:27,538
Or was it 34?

376
00:17:27,643 --> 00:17:30,081
Well, he died a hero.

377
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,746
He was more than a hero.

378
00:17:31,786 --> 00:17:33,552
He was a union man.

379
00:17:45,488 --> 00:17:48,360
I see the problem now.

380
00:17:48,396 --> 00:17:51,495
You've got a bad ODN relay here.

381
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:54,444
We'll have to replace
the whole unit.

382
00:17:54,478 --> 00:17:56,038
How long will it take?

383
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,143
Two to three hours.

384
00:17:57,186 --> 00:17:59,054
But after that,
it'll work like a charm.

385
00:17:59,091 --> 00:18:00,857
Until the next time
it breaks down.

386
00:18:00,895 --> 00:18:02,889
Well, that's the problem
when you combine

387
00:18:02,934 --> 00:18:05,498
Cardassian, Bajoran
and Federation technology.

388
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,739
None of it was meant
to work together.

389
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,944
How do you tolerate
working in this environment?

390
00:18:09,985 --> 00:18:12,959
Well, it's a lot easier
than working on the <i>Enterprise.</i>

391
00:18:12,993 --> 00:18:15,761
Easier? The <i>Enterprise</i> never had
these kind of problems.

392
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,292
Tell me about it.

393
00:18:17,338 --> 00:18:19,606
Have you any idea
how bored I used to get

394
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:21,545
sitting in the transporter room

395
00:18:21,582 --> 00:18:23,610
waiting for something
to break down?

396
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:26,319
Here, I've half a dozen
new problems every day.

397
00:18:26,361 --> 00:18:27,625
This station needs me.

398
00:18:27,697 --> 00:18:29,098
Oh, do me a favor.

399
00:18:29,135 --> 00:18:31,607
Hand me down the coil spanner?

400
00:18:46,046 --> 00:18:47,710
Happy cleansing.

401
00:18:57,074 --> 00:19:00,480
If this is
a surprise birthday party

402
00:19:00,517 --> 00:19:01,645
you're a month late.

403
00:19:01,753 --> 00:19:03,154
It's not a party.

404
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:06,062
We're the Guild of Restaurant
and Casino Employees

405
00:19:06,098 --> 00:19:08,262
and we're here
to present our demands.

406
00:19:08,303 --> 00:19:11,675
The Guild of Restaurant
and Casino Employees?

407
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:13,875
What's that supposed to be?

408
00:19:13,918 --> 00:19:15,148
What does it sound like?

409
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:18,184
It sounds like...

410
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:20,667
like a union.

411
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,171
Exactly.

412
00:19:22,206 --> 00:19:25,146
So you'd better take
our demands seriously.

413
00:19:32,499 --> 00:19:35,496
"Increased pay...

414
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,671
"Shorter hours...

415
00:19:37,713 --> 00:19:40,277
Paid sick leave..."

416
00:19:41,991 --> 00:19:43,517
This is no joke.

417
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:45,031
Yes, it is.

418
00:19:45,065 --> 00:19:48,096
And the fact that you
don't know that it is

419
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,077
is what makes it so funny.

420
00:19:51,015 --> 00:19:52,143
Now get back to work

421
00:19:52,183 --> 00:19:53,915
before I fire the lot of you.

422
00:19:53,955 --> 00:19:55,481
You can't fire us.

423
00:19:55,526 --> 00:19:56,654
Why not?

424
00:19:57,866 --> 00:20:00,065
Because as of right now...

425
00:20:01,642 --> 00:20:03,910
we're all on strike.

426
00:20:03,947 --> 00:20:05,084
Yeah!

427
00:20:23,732 --> 00:20:26,000
Thank you for not
patronizing Quark's.

428
00:20:26,105 --> 00:20:28,543
Thanks very much.

429
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:31,747
Thank you for not
patronizing Quark's.

430
00:20:31,787 --> 00:20:34,021
Thank you for not patronizing
Quark's.

431
00:20:34,092 --> 00:20:36,394
Thank you for not
patronizing Quark's.

432
00:20:36,432 --> 00:20:38,768
Thank you for not patronizing
Quark's.

433
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:40,400
I hope Rom's voice holds out.

434
00:20:40,443 --> 00:20:42,277
I hope our latinum holds out.

435
00:20:42,314 --> 00:20:43,340
Ahh...

436
00:20:48,564 --> 00:20:49,999
You wanted to see me?

437
00:20:50,034 --> 00:20:51,560
May I take your order, sir?

438
00:20:51,604 --> 00:20:53,541
Quark, I'm in no mood for games.

439
00:20:53,577 --> 00:20:56,483
There seems to be an opening
at the dabo table

440
00:20:56,517 --> 00:20:59,958
or perhaps I might interest you
in some time in the holosuites.

441
00:21:03,836 --> 00:21:04,998
Not again.

442
00:21:10,086 --> 00:21:11,818
Are you carrying
a tricorder or anything

443
00:21:11,857 --> 00:21:13,190
with a portable energy source?

444
00:21:13,227 --> 00:21:14,753
What are you talking about?

445
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:17,600
I'm still working out the bugs
in these holographic waiters.

446
00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:20,807
The Lissepian
who sold me the program

447
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:23,513
neglected to mention
that certain energy sources

448
00:21:23,554 --> 00:21:25,992
can interfere
with the imaging system.

449
00:21:26,027 --> 00:21:29,433
Sounds like there's no end
to the problems you're facing.

450
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,407
I can take care
of the Lissepian.

451
00:21:31,441 --> 00:21:33,709
I need you to get those...

452
00:21:33,748 --> 00:21:36,881
traitors away
from my front door.

453
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:40,294
They're blocking access
to my place of business

454
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:42,599
causing a disturbance
on the Promenade

455
00:21:42,637 --> 00:21:46,704
and they're probably
a fire hazard.

456
00:21:46,747 --> 00:21:49,549
They belong in a holding cell!

457
00:21:49,588 --> 00:21:51,890
Every last one of them.

458
00:21:51,928 --> 00:21:55,870
Well, I hate to admit this,
but I agree with you.

459
00:21:55,905 --> 00:21:58,343
From what Chief O'Brien
tells me about strikes

460
00:21:58,378 --> 00:22:00,474
they sound like trouble.

461
00:22:00,516 --> 00:22:01,883
I don't like mobs.

462
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:04,827
In my opinion, if you need
one to get what you want

463
00:22:04,861 --> 00:22:06,125
it's not worth getting.

464
00:22:06,232 --> 00:22:08,396
Good.
Then you'll haul them away.

465
00:22:08,437 --> 00:22:09,906
I'll do nothing of the sort.

466
00:22:09,942 --> 00:22:11,104
But you said...

467
00:22:11,144 --> 00:22:12,670
I know what I said

468
00:22:12,715 --> 00:22:15,655
but I have strict orders
from Captain Sisko not to...

469
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:19,496
impinge on your employees'
freedom of expression.

470
00:22:19,533 --> 00:22:21,436
As long as they stay peaceful

471
00:22:21,471 --> 00:22:23,066
and allow your customers access

472
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:24,841
through the second-level
entrance

473
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,475
I'm not allowed to interfere.

474
00:22:26,518 --> 00:22:29,822
In that case, would you mind
serving some drinks?

475
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:31,659
Huh!

476
00:22:31,697 --> 00:22:33,030
I didn't think so.

477
00:22:39,552 --> 00:22:41,182
What about the Vulcan?

478
00:22:41,222 --> 00:22:42,782
With their sense of ethics

479
00:22:42,826 --> 00:22:45,128
definitely on the side of labor.

480
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:47,069
Pass.

481
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:52,780
I say this one's an "enter."

482
00:22:58,066 --> 00:23:00,060
Lucky guess.

483
00:23:01,174 --> 00:23:03,077
Pass.

484
00:23:03,112 --> 00:23:05,641
He barely set foot in there
when there wasn't a strike.

485
00:23:05,686 --> 00:23:07,782
Mmm. Quark isn't exactly
his favorite person.

486
00:23:10,164 --> 00:23:11,463
Wait a minute.

487
00:23:11,501 --> 00:23:12,561
I can't believe it.

488
00:23:12,604 --> 00:23:13,573
He's an "enter."

489
00:23:13,606 --> 00:23:15,132
Not for long.

490
00:23:15,177 --> 00:23:16,237
Where are you going?

491
00:23:16,347 --> 00:23:18,215
To talk some sense into him.

492
00:23:18,252 --> 00:23:20,690
Commander! Hold on!

493
00:23:27,777 --> 00:23:30,181
I cannot believe
what I'm seeing.

494
00:23:30,216 --> 00:23:31,185
Sir.

495
00:23:31,218 --> 00:23:33,086
If I could explain...

496
00:23:33,123 --> 00:23:35,995
Mr. Worf, do I look like
I'm ready for an explanation?

497
00:23:36,031 --> 00:23:38,799
Three of my senior staff,
brawling on the Promenade.

498
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:40,537
With all due respect, sir,
we, we weren't brawling.

499
00:23:40,576 --> 00:23:42,068
Maybe you should take
a closer look

500
00:23:42,114 --> 00:23:43,276
at Dr. Bashir's forehead.

501
00:23:44,721 --> 00:23:46,487
Well, he shouldn't
have got in the way.

502
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:49,089
I was trying... I was trying
to stop the fight.

503
00:23:49,132 --> 00:23:51,103
We were not fighting.

504
00:23:51,137 --> 00:23:52,697
Then what were you doing?

505
00:23:52,742 --> 00:23:53,711
Well, we...

506
00:23:53,744 --> 00:23:55,442
Having a difference
of opinion.

507
00:23:55,482 --> 00:23:56,678
Yeah, I suppose...

508
00:23:56,718 --> 00:23:58,986
towards the end there,
we might have...

509
00:23:59,024 --> 00:24:00,493
done a bit of shoving.

510
00:24:00,528 --> 00:24:01,588
According to Odo

511
00:24:01,631 --> 00:24:03,761
Dr. Bashir was shoved
over a table.

512
00:24:03,803 --> 00:24:06,275
Now, that was an accident.

513
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:09,681
It was just that things
got a little out of hand.

514
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:12,157
Things got more than
a little out of hand.

515
00:24:12,192 --> 00:24:14,994
I suppose I'm going to have
to talk to Quark myself.

516
00:24:15,032 --> 00:24:17,003
Find a way
to settle this strike

517
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,340
get things back
to normal around here.

518
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:20,811
Uh, Captain?

519
00:24:22,251 --> 00:24:23,983
Can we leave now?

520
00:24:24,023 --> 00:24:27,361
I'll tell Constable Odo
to let you go...

521
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:30,030
in the morning.

522
00:24:32,277 --> 00:24:35,718
Well, I hope you're proud
of yourselves.

523
00:24:39,997 --> 00:24:41,398
Captain, believe me...

524
00:24:41,468 --> 00:24:44,202
I want this strike settled
as much as you do.

525
00:24:44,242 --> 00:24:46,179
Then settle it.

526
00:24:46,213 --> 00:24:47,705
It's not that simple.

527
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:48,720
Make it simple.

528
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:50,279
Sit down with your brother

529
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:52,261
and hammer out
an agreement today.

530
00:24:52,296 --> 00:24:56,238
Captain, I'm afraid
you don't understand

531
00:24:56,273 --> 00:24:58,437
what a delicate
situation this is.

532
00:24:58,479 --> 00:25:02,855
Even talking with strikers
would be a violation

533
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:05,864
of the most sacred precepts
of Ferengi culture.

534
00:25:05,898 --> 00:25:08,530
Maybe I don't know much
about Ferengi culture

535
00:25:08,571 --> 00:25:11,409
but I do know who holds
the lease on your bar.

536
00:25:11,445 --> 00:25:13,917
The Federation.

537
00:25:13,952 --> 00:25:15,980
And I couldn't ask
for better landlords.

538
00:25:16,024 --> 00:25:17,084
That's because

539
00:25:17,127 --> 00:25:18,791
we don't ask you
to pay your rent

540
00:25:18,831 --> 00:25:20,961
or to reimburse us
for your maintenance repairs

541
00:25:21,004 --> 00:25:23,442
or the drain
on the station's power supply.

542
00:25:23,544 --> 00:25:26,244
You're a very generous people.

543
00:25:26,284 --> 00:25:27,810
Until today.

544
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:30,719
Let's see.

545
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:33,360
Five years of back rent

546
00:25:33,403 --> 00:25:37,038
plus power consumption,
plus repairs...

547
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:39,778
Do you know
how much latinum that is?

548
00:25:39,819 --> 00:25:40,788
A lot.

549
00:25:40,821 --> 00:25:41,790
That's right.

550
00:25:41,824 --> 00:25:43,384
I'll talk to my brother.

551
00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:45,366
I'm glad we're in agreement.

552
00:25:45,401 --> 00:25:48,500
Labor... Labor...

553
00:25:48,609 --> 00:25:50,078
Where's wages?

554
00:25:50,112 --> 00:25:52,106
Wages are here.
Oh, wages...

555
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,114
Come in.

556
00:25:58,802 --> 00:26:00,328
What do you want?

557
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,074
Here.

558
00:26:04,818 --> 00:26:06,287
What's this?

559
00:26:06,321 --> 00:26:07,916
It's the amount of latinum

560
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:10,625
I'm willing to transfer
into your private account

561
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:13,640
if you'll just end this strike.

562
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,947
Are we talking about slips,
strips

563
00:26:17,985 --> 00:26:18,976
or bars?

564
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,250
Slips.

565
00:26:21,494 --> 00:26:24,468
All right, strips.

566
00:26:24,502 --> 00:26:26,530
It wouldn't matter
if it were bars.

567
00:26:26,608 --> 00:26:31,018
I'm not going to end the strike
unless you meet our demands.

568
00:26:31,052 --> 00:26:33,547
Rom, we shouldn't be fighting...
we're brothers.

569
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:35,426
Not when it comes to business.

570
00:26:35,464 --> 00:26:38,096
We're nothing
but employer and employee.

571
00:26:38,137 --> 00:26:40,165
You've said so yourself.

572
00:26:40,209 --> 00:26:42,180
I was wrong.

573
00:26:42,214 --> 00:26:44,310
No.

574
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:45,879
You weren't.

575
00:26:48,932 --> 00:26:51,028
Rom, can't we talk about this?

576
00:26:51,071 --> 00:26:52,905
There's only one thing
I have to say to you.

577
00:26:56,551 --> 00:27:00,254
"Workers of the world unite.

578
00:27:00,294 --> 00:27:04,236
You have nothing to lose
but your chains."

579
00:27:04,272 --> 00:27:07,907
What's happened to you?

580
00:27:24,592 --> 00:27:26,222
Ah.

581
00:27:26,263 --> 00:27:28,565
It's about time you got back.

582
00:27:28,603 --> 00:27:30,233
Brunt.

583
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:33,247
That's Liquidator Brunt to you.

584
00:27:33,281 --> 00:27:35,685
I see you remember me.

585
00:27:35,721 --> 00:27:37,749
Who could forget?

586
00:27:37,793 --> 00:27:39,730
What do you want?

587
00:27:39,764 --> 00:27:40,824
Quark, don't worry.

588
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,167
I'm here to help.

589
00:27:42,204 --> 00:27:45,440
The Ferengi Commerce Authority
has ordered me to end

590
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,477
this nasty little
labor dispute of yours.

591
00:27:48,521 --> 00:27:50,891
How do you propose to do that?

592
00:27:50,927 --> 00:27:54,596
By any means necessary.

593
00:28:04,161 --> 00:28:08,298
I hear Quark had only
14 customers all day.

594
00:28:08,372 --> 00:28:10,036
And he'll have
even less tomorrow.

595
00:28:10,077 --> 00:28:12,413
I've been talking with people
all over the station

596
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,216
and support
for our cause is growing.

597
00:28:14,254 --> 00:28:16,282
Quark will have to settle...

598
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:18,731
either that
or go out of business.

599
00:28:19,735 --> 00:28:22,333
I don't know.

600
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:24,141
Quark can be awful stubborn.

601
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,948
I think he'd rather lose
the bar than give in to us.

602
00:28:26,988 --> 00:28:28,652
Don't be such a pessimist.

603
00:28:28,692 --> 00:28:30,891
Remember Rule
of Acquisition 263:

604
00:28:30,931 --> 00:28:34,235
"Never allow doubt to tarnish
your lust for latinum."

605
00:28:34,273 --> 00:28:37,645
Your brother can quote
Rules of Acquisition, too.

606
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,846
I believe his favorite is 211:

607
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:43,385
"Employees are the rungs
on the ladder of success.

608
00:28:43,463 --> 00:28:45,731
Don't hesitate to step on them."

609
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,570
My ex-brother

610
00:28:47,608 --> 00:28:49,602
wasn't quoting
the Rules of Acquisition

611
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:51,344
when he came
to see me yesterday.

612
00:28:51,384 --> 00:28:52,751
Hmm. What did he say?

613
00:28:52,788 --> 00:28:54,691
He offered me a bribe

614
00:28:54,726 --> 00:28:56,788
if I would end the strike.

615
00:28:56,831 --> 00:28:57,822
Did you take it?

616
00:28:57,867 --> 00:28:58,893
No, I didn't take it!

617
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,601
Don't you see what that means?

618
00:29:00,642 --> 00:29:01,941
He's getting desperate.

619
00:29:01,978 --> 00:29:04,644
A few more days and we'll get
everything we want.

620
00:29:15,513 --> 00:29:17,108
Brunt.

621
00:29:17,151 --> 00:29:19,555
FCA.

622
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,060
It's not my fault!

623
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:22,826
They made me do it!

624
00:29:22,866 --> 00:29:24,734
It was all his idea!

625
00:29:24,771 --> 00:29:26,070
Forgive me!

626
00:29:26,107 --> 00:29:29,240
If this were Ferenginar...

627
00:29:29,282 --> 00:29:31,777
I'd have you all taken

628
00:29:31,822 --> 00:29:34,386
to the spire
of the Tower of Commerce

629
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:39,101
displayed to the crowds
in the Great Marketplace below

630
00:29:39,141 --> 00:29:42,115
and then shoved off...

631
00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:44,383
one by one!

632
00:29:44,422 --> 00:29:47,054
Small children would bet
on where you would land

633
00:29:47,095 --> 00:29:49,499
and your spattered remains
would be sold

634
00:29:49,602 --> 00:29:51,732
as feed mulch for gree worms.

635
00:29:51,774 --> 00:29:52,936
Spare me.

636
00:29:52,977 --> 00:29:54,276
I'm old.

637
00:29:54,314 --> 00:29:56,114
I'm fragile.

638
00:29:57,322 --> 00:30:00,353
I'll push the rest of them
off myself.

639
00:30:00,396 --> 00:30:03,802
I thought you said you
weren't afraid of the FCA.

640
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:05,935
I lied.

641
00:30:05,978 --> 00:30:07,642
Don't let him intimidate you.

642
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:09,117
We're not on Ferenginar.

643
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,681
Lucky for you.

644
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,894
But the FCA understands

645
00:30:14,934 --> 00:30:18,170
that living
on this station has...

646
00:30:19,613 --> 00:30:22,712
c-corrupted you.

647
00:30:22,755 --> 00:30:26,196
You've been tempted
by unwholesome Bajoran ideals

648
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,828
exposed to the twisted values

649
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:31,366
of the Federation,
and because of that

650
00:30:31,411 --> 00:30:34,145
we are willing to forgive.

651
00:30:34,184 --> 00:30:35,153
Really?

652
00:30:35,187 --> 00:30:38,491
But don't confuse our mercy
with weakness.

653
00:30:38,529 --> 00:30:41,628
If you are not back at your jobs
tomorrow morning

654
00:30:41,737 --> 00:30:44,232
your financial accounts
on Ferenginar

655
00:30:44,277 --> 00:30:47,410
will be confiscated,
your families will be fined

656
00:30:47,452 --> 00:30:50,585
and your trading permits
revoked.

657
00:30:50,627 --> 00:30:53,065
You'll be ruined...

658
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:58,410
reduced to utter destitution.

659
00:30:58,447 --> 00:31:01,387
Am I... understood?

660
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:04,986
Good.

661
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:07,893
I thought so.

662
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:12,041
Don't bother getting up.

663
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:22,934
Would you get up?

664
00:31:24,047 --> 00:31:25,482
Come on.

665
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:27,488
Let him stay there.

666
00:31:27,522 --> 00:31:29,493
That's where he belongs.

667
00:31:29,527 --> 00:31:33,664
The question is:
Where do we belong?

668
00:31:33,705 --> 00:31:36,543
On our knees... like Frool?

669
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,613
Or standing tall
like Sean O'Brien?

670
00:31:40,656 --> 00:31:42,023
Who's Sean O'Brien?

671
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,427
He was a union man...

672
00:31:43,464 --> 00:31:46,336
a man who gave his life
to earn a decent wage

673
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:47,840
for his fellow workers.

674
00:31:47,876 --> 00:31:50,040
Brunt wouldn't have
intimidated him

675
00:31:50,081 --> 00:31:51,847
and he won't intimidate me.

676
00:31:51,886 --> 00:31:53,686
What about our accounts
on Ferenginar?

677
00:31:53,724 --> 00:31:55,923
If your accounts on Ferenginar
were worth anything

678
00:31:55,963 --> 00:31:57,593
you wouldn't be working
as a waiter.

679
00:31:57,634 --> 00:32:00,038
I'm telling you...
nothing has changed.

680
00:32:00,073 --> 00:32:01,941
Victory is within our grasp.

681
00:32:01,978 --> 00:32:05,111
All we have to do is take it.

682
00:32:06,323 --> 00:32:07,690
Now, are you with me?

683
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:09,720
Yes!

684
00:32:09,766 --> 00:32:11,133
I said are you with me?

685
00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:12,433
Yes!

686
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,375
Then let's get back
on that picket line

687
00:32:14,411 --> 00:32:16,245
and show Quark
what we're made of.

688
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:28,711
Can I get up now?

689
00:32:28,848 --> 00:32:30,181
Look sharp now.

690
00:32:30,218 --> 00:32:32,189
No slouching.

691
00:32:32,224 --> 00:32:33,693
Remember...

692
00:32:33,728 --> 00:32:36,600
in unity, there is strength.

693
00:32:36,636 --> 00:32:39,006
So be strong.

694
00:32:45,425 --> 00:32:47,396
Chief, may I speak with you?

695
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,333
Sure.
What's on your mind?

696
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:51,202
I feel I owe you an apology.

697
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,738
I allowed our argument
in Quark's to get out of hand.

698
00:32:54,783 --> 00:32:57,187
I think there was plenty
of blame to spread around.

699
00:32:57,222 --> 00:32:59,626
Nonetheless, we are
Starfleet officers

700
00:32:59,661 --> 00:33:02,931
and Starfleet officers do
not brawl with each other.

701
00:33:02,971 --> 00:33:04,635
It wasn't much of a brawl,
really.

702
00:33:04,674 --> 00:33:06,166
I grabbed you, you shoved me

703
00:33:06,212 --> 00:33:08,980
and Julian was tossed
over a table.

704
00:33:09,019 --> 00:33:10,352
Well, it never
should have happened

705
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,689
and under normal circumstances

706
00:33:11,727 --> 00:33:13,322
it never would have,
but there's something

707
00:33:13,364 --> 00:33:16,668
about this station
I find... unsettling.

708
00:33:16,706 --> 00:33:18,039
You'll get used to it.

709
00:33:18,076 --> 00:33:19,842
Perhaps.

710
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:22,787
But in the meantime,
I think I've found a solution.

711
00:33:22,821 --> 00:33:25,623
I'm going to move my quarters
to the <i>Defiant.</i>

712
00:33:25,662 --> 00:33:27,428
You're going to live
on the <i>Defiant?</i>

713
00:33:27,467 --> 00:33:29,666
I've already discussed
it with Captain Sisko.

714
00:33:29,706 --> 00:33:30,800
And he said yes?

715
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,870
As long as it doesn't
interfere with my duties.

716
00:33:32,915 --> 00:33:36,914
But... you'll be living
out there all by yourself.

717
00:33:38,997 --> 00:33:41,127
I know.

718
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:45,057
That was pretty impressive...

719
00:33:45,092 --> 00:33:46,584
standing up to Brunt
the way you did.

720
00:33:46,629 --> 00:33:49,295
Who'd have thought I had such
natural leadership skills?

721
00:33:49,337 --> 00:33:50,806
Oh, I knew it all along.

722
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,809
Really?

723
00:33:51,843 --> 00:33:53,609
No.

724
00:33:53,648 --> 00:33:55,482
I didn't think so.

725
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,049
Well, you surprised
a lot of people

726
00:33:58,093 --> 00:33:59,289
including me.

727
00:34:00,432 --> 00:34:01,833
I've got to get ready.

728
00:34:01,869 --> 00:34:03,737
I'm having dinner with Julian.

729
00:34:03,774 --> 00:34:06,338
He's a lucky man.

730
00:34:06,381 --> 00:34:09,013
And almost as brave as you are.

731
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,099
Psst.

732
00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:27,159
Rom.

733
00:34:29,307 --> 00:34:31,175
She kissed me.

734
00:34:31,212 --> 00:34:33,376
There's no accounting
for taste.

735
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:34,978
Rom, we have to talk.

736
00:34:35,022 --> 00:34:37,186
Are you ready to give
in to our demands?

737
00:34:37,227 --> 00:34:38,196
Of course not.

738
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,258
Then there's nothing
to talk about.

739
00:34:40,302 --> 00:34:43,174
There's plenty to talk about.

740
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:45,181
The FCA's involved now.

741
00:34:45,215 --> 00:34:46,582
And those Nausicaans
working for Brunt

742
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:47,848
aren't just for show.

743
00:34:47,888 --> 00:34:49,825
I'm not going to let
Brunt intimidate me.

744
00:34:52,501 --> 00:34:54,165
Don't you see, Rom?

745
00:34:54,205 --> 00:34:55,504
You should be intimidated.

746
00:34:55,542 --> 00:34:57,570
There's no telling
what Brunt might do

747
00:34:57,614 --> 00:34:59,882
and I don't want you
to get hurt.

748
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,688
You never cared
what happened to me before.

749
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:04,857
I always cared about you.

750
00:35:04,899 --> 00:35:06,961
I tried to protect you.
Save you from yourself.

751
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:09,945
How? By telling me I was
an idiot my whole life?

752
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,949
I had to be tough on you.

753
00:35:10,982 --> 00:35:12,474
I was trying to make
you a better Ferengi.

754
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,354
What you were trying to do

755
00:35:14,391 --> 00:35:16,555
was make yourself
feel important.

756
00:35:16,596 --> 00:35:19,194
Making me feel dumb
made you feel smart.

757
00:35:19,236 --> 00:35:20,535
But I'm not dumb

758
00:35:20,573 --> 00:35:24,447
and you're not half as smart
as you think you are.

759
00:35:24,484 --> 00:35:26,979
Rom, you have to listen to me.

760
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:29,998
The FCA doesn't have
to answer to anyone.

761
00:35:30,032 --> 00:35:33,769
And if Brunt decides
to get rid of you

762
00:35:33,808 --> 00:35:36,406
I won't be able to stop him.

763
00:35:39,489 --> 00:35:40,981
Look at it this way.

764
00:35:41,026 --> 00:35:43,225
If Brunt gets rid of me

765
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,966
then all your problems
are solved.

766
00:35:46,006 --> 00:35:49,003
You always said you wanted
to be an only child.

767
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,216
Doesn't that hurt?

768
00:36:04,253 --> 00:36:06,487
I'm sure it does.

769
00:36:06,526 --> 00:36:09,728
Most Nausicaan games do.

770
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:12,138
Speaking of pain...

771
00:36:12,174 --> 00:36:14,408
did you talk to your brother?

772
00:36:14,447 --> 00:36:15,643
We talked.

773
00:36:15,684 --> 00:36:16,549
And?

774
00:36:16,585 --> 00:36:18,579
I need more time.

775
00:36:18,624 --> 00:36:21,496
Time, like latinum,
is a highly limited commodity.

776
00:36:21,532 --> 00:36:24,404
Look,
you're here to help me, right?

777
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,568
Wrong.

778
00:36:25,608 --> 00:36:27,272
I'm here to enforce Ferengi law

779
00:36:27,313 --> 00:36:29,045
and to protect Ferengi tradition

780
00:36:29,085 --> 00:36:31,523
and that means putting an end
to this strike.

781
00:36:34,231 --> 00:36:38,003
Now, I can see that we are
going to have to make...

782
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:41,379
an example of someone.

783
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:44,448
What kind of example?

784
00:36:44,492 --> 00:36:47,557
Oh, I'm sure that we'll
come up with something

785
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,098
that will get
people's attention.

786
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:54,914
I, uh... don't want
my brother hurt.

787
00:36:54,985 --> 00:36:57,219
Oh, I wasn't thinking of him.

788
00:36:57,258 --> 00:36:58,693
Attack the leader
of a movement

789
00:36:58,728 --> 00:37:00,027
you risk creating a martyr.

790
00:37:00,065 --> 00:37:03,437
No, Rom must not be touched.

791
00:37:03,474 --> 00:37:06,312
Our target must be someone...

792
00:37:06,347 --> 00:37:08,147
unexpected.

793
00:37:08,186 --> 00:37:10,556
Someone he cares about...

794
00:37:10,592 --> 00:37:12,529
like that dabo girl.

795
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:15,128
Leeta.

796
00:37:15,171 --> 00:37:16,367
But she's not even Ferengi.

797
00:37:16,408 --> 00:37:17,399
I know.

798
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,642
That's what makes it
so memorable.

799
00:37:19,683 --> 00:37:22,019
But she has such...

800
00:37:22,056 --> 00:37:24,118
delicate lobes.

801
00:37:24,161 --> 00:37:27,260
I'm afraid I couldn't bring
myself to give the order.

802
00:37:27,302 --> 00:37:29,432
No, let's see.

803
00:37:29,474 --> 00:37:31,502
Who else...

804
00:37:31,547 --> 00:37:34,885
does Rom care about?

805
00:37:39,433 --> 00:37:40,595
Boys?

806
00:37:45,148 --> 00:37:46,617
Me?

807
00:37:46,653 --> 00:37:48,715
But I'm on your side.

808
00:37:48,758 --> 00:37:50,353
Ironic...

809
00:37:50,396 --> 00:37:51,991
isn't it?

810
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,564
I thought I wasn't allowed
to have any visitors.

811
00:38:07,607 --> 00:38:10,102
Dr. Bashir made an exception.

812
00:38:10,146 --> 00:38:13,815
He said you were almost killed.

813
00:38:13,856 --> 00:38:15,827
It's nothing to smile about.

814
00:38:15,862 --> 00:38:19,303
Those Nausicaans shattered
my left eye socket

815
00:38:19,337 --> 00:38:21,639
broke two of my ascending ribs

816
00:38:21,677 --> 00:38:23,739
and punctured my lower lung.

817
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,025
If Odo hadn't come along
when he did...

818
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,154
Does it hurt?

819
00:38:29,196 --> 00:38:31,725
Of course, it hurts.

820
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,299
Too bad.

821
00:38:34,343 --> 00:38:36,747
If you're going
to stand there and gloat

822
00:38:36,783 --> 00:38:39,051
you can leave right now.

823
00:38:39,089 --> 00:38:40,615
I'm not done gloating.

824
00:38:40,659 --> 00:38:41,889
Don't you get it?

825
00:38:41,929 --> 00:38:44,401
This was a message for you.

826
00:38:44,436 --> 00:38:46,236
Well, it's not going to work.

827
00:38:47,644 --> 00:38:50,812
I wish Brunt had known that.

828
00:38:50,852 --> 00:38:52,652
Odo has him and the Nausicaans
in a holding cell.

829
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:55,288
He says
it's an open-and-shut case.

830
00:38:55,331 --> 00:38:57,268
It's an open-and-shut
case all right

831
00:38:57,303 --> 00:38:59,240
but I'm not going
to press charges.

832
00:38:59,274 --> 00:39:00,265
You're not?

833
00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:01,541
Of course not.

834
00:39:01,581 --> 00:39:03,919
I'm in enough trouble
with the FCA as it is.

835
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:06,181
But then Odo will
have to let them go.

836
00:39:06,224 --> 00:39:07,557
Either way, the FCA

837
00:39:07,594 --> 00:39:10,226
will just send
another Liquidator

838
00:39:10,267 --> 00:39:13,605
and that one will make
an example of you.

839
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:15,807
Then you'll be the one gloating.

840
00:39:15,849 --> 00:39:17,877
I don't want to gloat.

841
00:39:17,921 --> 00:39:20,257
I want to end the strike.

842
00:39:20,293 --> 00:39:21,387
So, give us what we want.

843
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:23,196
Rom, I can't!

844
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:26,141
I'm not going against 10,000
years of Ferengi tradition.

845
00:39:26,176 --> 00:39:28,580
You're just afraid of the FCA.

846
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:31,180
Of course,
I'm afraid of the FCA.

847
00:39:31,222 --> 00:39:33,751
They crushed my eye socket.

848
00:39:33,796 --> 00:39:37,237
And if you had any sense,
you'd be afraid of them, too.

849
00:39:37,272 --> 00:39:40,246
If this strike
doesn't get settled soon

850
00:39:40,279 --> 00:39:42,774
we're both going
to find ourselves

851
00:39:42,886 --> 00:39:45,450
tossed out
of the nearest airlock.

852
00:39:45,493 --> 00:39:47,897
You have to dissolve the union.

853
00:39:54,416 --> 00:39:56,650
At least officially.

854
00:39:58,326 --> 00:39:59,818
What do you mean?

855
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,798
I mean...

856
00:40:05,879 --> 00:40:10,688
I mean, you
dissolve the union...

857
00:40:10,725 --> 00:40:12,855
make it look like I've won...

858
00:40:12,964 --> 00:40:16,633
and I'll give you
everything you want.

859
00:40:16,674 --> 00:40:18,143
You'll meet our demands?

860
00:40:18,178 --> 00:40:20,342
That's what I just said,
you idiot.

861
00:40:20,383 --> 00:40:21,443
Even sick leave?

862
00:40:21,486 --> 00:40:23,754
Even sick leave.

863
00:40:24,929 --> 00:40:26,524
And six months from now

864
00:40:26,566 --> 00:40:29,404
when the FCA isn't
watching my books so closely

865
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,739
you'll get your raises.

866
00:40:30,777 --> 00:40:31,768
Six months!

867
00:40:31,813 --> 00:40:33,305
It's the best I can do!

868
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:34,319
No, it's not.

869
00:40:34,353 --> 00:40:35,549
All you have to do is make up

870
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:37,458
one of your fake
business ledgers for the FCA.

871
00:40:37,494 --> 00:40:39,362
They'll never
know the difference.

872
00:40:39,399 --> 00:40:41,667
Shh!

873
00:40:44,713 --> 00:40:46,581
All right.

874
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:49,558
You'll get your raises
by the end of the week

875
00:40:49,592 --> 00:40:52,964
but the union dies here...

876
00:40:53,002 --> 00:40:55,338
today...

877
00:40:55,374 --> 00:40:58,872
and that's my final offer.

878
00:41:14,992 --> 00:41:16,656
Better?

879
00:41:18,067 --> 00:41:19,502
Much.

880
00:41:19,537 --> 00:41:21,975
I thought about
getting you a plant

881
00:41:22,043 --> 00:41:24,413
but somehow
it didn't seem right.

882
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:25,578
A wise decision.

883
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:28,457
So I brought you this instead.

884
00:41:30,531 --> 00:41:33,664
It's a collection
of my favorite Klingon operas.

885
00:41:33,707 --> 00:41:34,903
Think about it.

886
00:41:34,944 --> 00:41:36,413
You can lie in bed

887
00:41:36,447 --> 00:41:38,885
and pipe them through
the <i>Defiant's</i> com system

888
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,449
and play them
as loud as you like.

889
00:41:41,494 --> 00:41:43,158
A thoughtful gift.

890
00:41:49,448 --> 00:41:51,043
You know, Worf

891
00:41:51,085 --> 00:41:53,284
in the end,
living on the <i>Defiant</i>

892
00:41:53,324 --> 00:41:54,988
isn't going to change anything.

893
00:41:55,029 --> 00:41:56,521
You're still going
to have to get used

894
00:41:56,566 --> 00:41:57,728
to life on the station.

895
00:41:57,769 --> 00:41:59,831
I am not sure I agree.

896
00:41:59,874 --> 00:42:02,871
Sooner or later,
you're going to have to adapt.

897
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:07,954
Perhaps in the end, it'll be all
of you that have to adapt to me.

898
00:42:14,078 --> 00:42:16,642
Come in! Come in!

899
00:42:16,685 --> 00:42:18,052
Welcome back.

900
00:42:18,156 --> 00:42:20,184
Why don't you try your luck
at the dabo wheel?

901
00:42:20,228 --> 00:42:22,392
Remember, every Bajoran
gets one free spin.

902
00:42:22,433 --> 00:42:23,402
You're in a good mood.

903
00:42:23,436 --> 00:42:25,066
I just got a raise.

904
00:42:25,174 --> 00:42:27,874
Major!

905
00:42:27,914 --> 00:42:32,723
I must say you are looking
particularly cleansed today.

906
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,198
Just get me
two mugs of synthale

907
00:42:35,233 --> 00:42:38,001
a double order
of <i>hasperat,</i> and, uh...

908
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,068
hold the conversation?

909
00:42:40,113 --> 00:42:42,677
No wonder I missed you.

910
00:42:45,226 --> 00:42:47,220
Ah! Rom, there you are.

911
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:50,102
Why aren't you
in your waiter's uniform?

912
00:42:50,139 --> 00:42:52,543
I'll have
a large snail juice, please

913
00:42:52,579 --> 00:42:53,673
straight up.

914
00:42:53,714 --> 00:42:55,149
You know there's
no drinking on the job.

915
00:42:55,185 --> 00:42:57,019
That's no way to talk
to a customer.

916
00:42:57,057 --> 00:42:59,085
You're not a customer,
you're an employee.

917
00:42:59,128 --> 00:43:00,654
Not anymore.

918
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,229
I've wiped my last table

919
00:43:03,273 --> 00:43:05,107
and mixed my last Black Hole.

920
00:43:05,144 --> 00:43:07,810
Starting today,
I'm one of the station's

921
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:11,087
diagnostic and repair
technicians, junior grade...

922
00:43:11,126 --> 00:43:13,120
night shift.

923
00:43:16,674 --> 00:43:18,372
You're quitting?

924
00:43:18,412 --> 00:43:20,280
Effective immediately.

925
00:43:22,555 --> 00:43:24,685
I gave you
everything you wanted.

926
00:43:24,728 --> 00:43:27,064
I know, but if the strike
taught me anything

927
00:43:27,101 --> 00:43:29,801
it's that I do a lot better
when you're not around.

928
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:30,935
Don't worry.

929
00:43:30,978 --> 00:43:33,473
I'll keep
your holosuites running

930
00:43:33,518 --> 00:43:35,922
and fix your replicators
when they're broken.

931
00:43:35,957 --> 00:43:37,928
I think this'll be really
good for our relationship.

932
00:43:37,962 --> 00:43:39,090
I don't.

933
00:43:39,132 --> 00:43:42,801
Think about it from
my point of view.

934
00:43:42,842 --> 00:43:45,907
If I keep working for you,
all I have to look forward to

935
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:48,514
is waiting for you to die
so I can inherit the bar.

936
00:43:48,557 --> 00:43:51,531
Well, I don't want you to die.

937
00:43:51,565 --> 00:43:55,632
And besides, I deserve
to have a life of my own now.

938
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:57,909
But without me
looking after you...

939
00:43:57,948 --> 00:43:59,646
I'll do fine.

940
00:44:01,189 --> 00:44:03,160
I suppose you will.

941
00:44:04,799 --> 00:44:06,200
I'll miss you.

942
00:44:06,302 --> 00:44:07,794
No, you won't.

943
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,212
I'll be here all the time,
only I'll be a paying customer.

944
00:44:11,282 --> 00:44:14,586
Now, get me my snail juice...

945
00:44:14,625 --> 00:44:16,927
Brother.

946
00:44:18,066 --> 00:44:20,196
Coming up.
