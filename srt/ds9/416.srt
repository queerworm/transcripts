1
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,182
Department heads,
prepare reports
for tomorrow's briefing.

2
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,976
All hands dismissed.

3
00:00:16,976 --> 00:00:19,394
I'd say that was
a successful mission.

4
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:22,523
Five days in the Gamma Quadrant
and no sign of the Jem'Hadar.

5
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:26,401
Commander...
during our maneuvers

6
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,487
through that asteroid belt
on the Kar-telos system,

7
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:31,156
I noticed the<i> Defiant</i>
felt a little... sluggish

8
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,491
when turning hard aport.

9
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,034
The inertial
dampening generators

10
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,452
may need to be realigned.

11
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:38,246
I'll begin drawing up
a schedule immediately.

12
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,541
And while we're at it,
we should recalibrate

13
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,293
the targeting scanners
and check the EPS relays.

14
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,005
O'Brien's going to be
a little disappointed.

15
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:48,173
He thought he finally
had the ship running smoothly.

16
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,885
Well, Chief O'Brien
has done an excellent job.

17
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:52,887
This is a fine ship.

18
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:55,180
But it<i> is</i> my duty
to keep her functioning

19
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,932
at peek
proficiency.

20
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:59,476
Mister Worf... you're in love.

21
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,437
With the<i> Defiant.</i>

22
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,815
You exaggerate...

23
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,441
as usual.

24
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,955
(<i> laughing</i> )

25
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:21,415
I feel silly.

26
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,124
I like it.

27
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,919
It shows off
your legs.

28
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:27,880
There you see--
your public has spoken.

29
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,757
Have fun.

30
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:32,384
What do you call this holosuite
program of yours again?

31
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,053
The Battle of Clontarf--

32
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:36,680
you, me and a thousand
stalwart Irish warriors

33
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,724
against a ravening
hoard of Vikings.

34
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:41,602
It's like the
Battle of Britain,
only with swords.

35
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,438
How come<i> you</i> get
to be High King?

36
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:48,483
I am a direct descendant
of King Brian Boru.

37
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,735
Besides...

38
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,194
it's my program.

39
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,405
I suppose
that's only fair.

40
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,211
(<i> sighing</i> )

41
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,007
Oh...

42
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,385
(<i> moaning</i> )

43
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,638
I know exactly
how you feel.

44
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,768
The Bajoran Time
of Cleansing.

45
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,937
Can someone explain to me
why the Bajorans need

46
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:28,565
to abstain
from worldly pleasures
for an entire month?

47
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,652
I mean, it's not like
they're a bunch of hedonistic,

48
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,237
holosuite-obsessed drunkards
to begin with.

49
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,197
(<i> moans</i> )

50
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,992
No use moaning about it.

51
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:40,035
It hurts.

52
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,329
Who's that for?
Me.

53
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,915
It's one of Moogie's
home remedies.

54
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,458
Your ear?

55
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,085
Again?

56
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:52,506
That's disgusting.

57
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,342
You want to drive away
all the rest of my customers?

58
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,052
I feel dizzy.

59
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,138
What else is new?

60
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:00,889
Go wait on table seven.

61
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,891
Rom, you look terrible.

62
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,434
I think you
better lie down.

63
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,603
I don't pay you to think.

64
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,814
I pay you to spin
the dabo wheel.

65
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,316
So get spinning.
But nobody's gambling.

66
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,861
How can they when you're not
at the wheel?

67
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,362
I really don't feel good.

68
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,196
LEETA:
Can't you see he's sick?

69
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,573
(<i> echoing</i> ):
He needs to lie down.

70
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,450
Just because
you happen to be

71
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,871
intimately acquainted with
Dr. Bashir's bedside manner

72
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,247
doesn't make you
a medical expert.

73
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,083
Brother, am I still standing?

74
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:33,130
What I do during my time off
is no business of yours.

75
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,132
If you don't get back
to work this instant,

76
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,176
you're going to have
more time off

77
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:38,593
than you know what to do with.

78
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,222
The same goes for you.
Here.

79
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,598
Yes, Brother.

80
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,518
(<i> thud</i> )

81
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,314
Aren't you going
to do something?

82
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,483
Of course,
I'm going to do something.

83
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,944
I'm going to dock his pay.

84
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,324
Briok, clean up this mess.

85
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:05,871
Oh...

86
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:09,828
Oh, this is one
stubborn infection.

87
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,496
How long have you had it?

88
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,124
Uh, a couple of weeks.

89
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,001
You mean to tell me
you've been walking around

90
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,170
with a seeping infection
of the tympanic membrane

91
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,546
for two weeks?

92
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,215
More like three,
actually.

93
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:25,177
Rom! You could have died.
Another 48 hours

94
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:27,888
and you would have been
bidding for a new life
at the Divine Treasury.

95
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,598
I guess it's a good thing
I fainted when I did.

96
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,267
Why didn't you come
and see me sooner?

97
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,393
I couldn't. I was busy.

98
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:37,438
I'm sure your brother
could have spared you
for half an hour.

99
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,566
It would have been
a violation of my contract--

100
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,277
paragraph 76,
subsection three.

101
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,988
"Employees of Quark's Bar
and Holding Company

102
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,657
"are strictly prohibited from
leaving the work environment

103
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:51,203
"during business hours
unless ordered to do so
by their employer.

104
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,788
"Any failure to comply
with this provision

105
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:57,084
will result in severe fines
and possible dismissal."

106
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:00,921
It's a standard provision
in all Ferengi labor contracts.

107
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:04,799
You mean, you don't get time off
even if you're sick?

108
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,593
It's all part of our...

109
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,346
generous employee
compensation package.

110
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,639
"No sick days,
no vacations

111
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,934
no paid overtime."

112
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,894
It sounds to me like
you need a better contract.

113
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,812
There's no such thing.

114
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,774
All Ferengi labor
contracts are the same.

115
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,110
Well, that should do it.

116
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,528
But I want you to see me
first thing in the morning
for a follow-up.

117
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,489
It'll have to be
before the bar opens.

118
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:31,201
What you people
need is a union.

119
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,535
A what?

120
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,913
You know,
a trade guild,

121
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,957
a collective bargaining
association, a union--

122
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,583
something to keep you
from being exploited.

123
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,710
You don't understand.

124
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,380
Ferengi workers don't want
to<i> stop</i> the exploitation.

125
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,466
We want to find a way
to become the exploiters.

126
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,176
Suit yourself.

127
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,804
But I don't see<i> you</i>
exploiting anyone.

128
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,817
Rom... how'd it go?

129
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,694
I'm okay.
Oh. Julian's
a wonderful doctor.

130
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,322
Your brother should have
let you see him weeks ago.

131
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,115
It's not Quark's fault
that I got sick.

132
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,326
I forgot to get
my bimonthly ear scan.

133
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:15,787
And besides, I've
probably been getting
too much<i> oo-mox.</i>

134
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,123
Really?
Who's the lucky female?

135
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,625
No female. Just me.

136
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,087
I'm... sorry.

137
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,090
Sorry enough to do
something about it?

138
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,593
I... don't think
Julian would approve.

139
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,720
We could ask him.

140
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,890
All right, everyone...
gather around.

141
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,309
What now?

142
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,519
I have an announcement
to make.

143
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,563
I've just been going over
today's receipts,

144
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,192
and it's not good.

145
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:49,612
The only thing this Bajoran
Cleansing Ritual has cleansed
is my profit margin.

146
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,073
So, starting tomorrow,

147
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:55,618
everyone's salary
gets cut by a third.

148
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,788
(<i> employees groaning</i> )
No, no, that's not fair.
I'll talk to him.

149
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:02,167
It's either that
or fire half the staff.

150
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,586
Don't bother thanking me.

151
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,588
I can't afford a pay cut.

152
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,716
It's either
a pay cut or a layoff.

153
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,343
You decide.

154
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:14,012
All right, everyone,
let's get back to work.

155
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,596
I want this place
cleaned up

156
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,183
and the lights off
in ten minutes.

157
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,352
Brother...
this isn't right.

158
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:23,104
You can't just cut
people's salaries
without warning.

159
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,816
Actually, I can.
And I have.

160
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,110
Now, why don't
you concentrate

161
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,112
on keeping your hands
off your lobes

162
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,365
and leave the business
matters to me.

163
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,575
But once the Cleansing
Ritual is over,

164
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,078
you'll restore
everyone's salary, right?

165
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,206
That depends on next
quarter's fiscal summation.

166
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,250
Brother, I'm asking you...

167
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,669
as a personal favor
to reconsider this pay cut.

168
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,422
Anything for you.

169
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,216
Um...

170
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,427
There.

171
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,053
I've reconsidered it.

172
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,513
My decision stands.

173
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,349
But, Brother...
Don't "Brother" me.

174
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,893
In this bar,
you're not my brother.

175
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,770
You're my employee.

176
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,022
And employees have no right
to question

I'm warning you.

If you don't rescind
the pay cuts...

180
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,196
you're going to regret it.

181
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,949
The only thing I regret

182
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,952
is not being an only child.

183

finally getting the hang
of this<i> mek'leth.</i>

185
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,340
Don't you think?
It would seem so.

186
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,634
Then why haven't
you told me?
A Klingon warrior

187
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,970
does not need the
praise of his teacher.

188
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,638
I'm not a Klingon warrior.

189
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,349
I'm a beautiful

Take him
to a holding cell.

202
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,265
I'll need a statement.
And you will have one.

203
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,601
But what I want to know is
how such a security breach

204
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,685
was allowed to occur
in the first place!

205
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,522
Unfortunately,
these things happen.

206
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,857
They did not happen
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

207
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,402
Really?

208
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,154
Well, let me see.

That will not

I know these incidents
are the exception

220
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:14,025
rather than the rule,
but if security breaches
like these

221

could happen on the flagship
of the Federation,

222
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,738
imagine the difficulty
of maintaining security

223

at an open port such as DS9.

224
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:26,246
I understand.
It is just that I find it...

00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,788

So do I.

that's proven unpopular
with the staff.

(<i> all agreeing</i> )

233
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:50,437
But I'm not going
to do that today.

You're not?

235
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,772
No. I'm not.

236
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:56,484
Quark's just using

00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,445
to increase his profits

238

(<i> all agreeing</i> )

239
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:04,659
It isn't fair.
And we're not going to take it.

Since... right now.

242
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,205
So what are we going
to do about it?

243
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:13,668
We're going to fight back
in the only way we can.

00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:41,988
Are you insane?
You've just destroyed the lives
of every Ferengi in this room.

251

A union.

Don't say that word again.
We're in enough trouble
as it is.

254
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:55,376
The Ferengi Commerce Authority
doesn't have to hear about this.

255
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,378
If we all go
back to work now,

256
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,798
no one else has
to know this
ever happened.

257
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,924
No, no!
It's too late for that.

258
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,051
The FCA
has ears everywhere.

259
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:07,263
As soon as their lobes
get wind of this,
we're all doomed!

260
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,640
(<i> employees muttering</i> )

261
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,142
All right!

262
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,977
So we're doomed.

But I say if they're
going to come after us,

266
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,445
let's give them a good reason.

Every one of you--
Ferengi and non-Ferengi alike--

268

Quark treats us is unfair.

It won't happen

277
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,804
unless you make it happen.

278
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,472
We're Ferengi!

279
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,808
And when a Ferengi
sees an opportunity,

280
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,393
what does he do?

281
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,728
He seizes it?

282
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,270
That's right!

283
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,148
And I, for one,
intend to grab it.

284
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:03,236
We've been exploited
long enough.

Union! Union!

301
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,393
What you have there
is a sebaceous cyst.

302
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,520
I know it's a cyst,
but it's getting bigger.

303
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,606
There's nothing
to worry about.
Dermatologically speaking,

304
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,148
you're perfectly
healthy.

305
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,025
Oh, I'm perfectly healthy
except I've got

306
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,111
a disgusting cyst
on the back of my neck.

307
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,196
Now either I paint a nose,
eyes and mouth on it

308
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,449
and pretend
I've got two heads,
or you take it off.

309
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,325
Well, I'll get
you some paint.

310
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,911
Julian, get it off me!

311
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:54,913
All right, all right.

312
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:57,206
But you know what they say:
Two heads are better than one.

313
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,250
Julian, I'm waiting.

314
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,922
Dr. Bashir,
I'm glad you're in.

315
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,381
I need your help.

316
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,966
Is that ear
acting up again?

317
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,343
My ear's fine.
I need some
advice about...

318
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,679
unions.
Unions.

319
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,682
You said the other day
I should form a union, so I did.

320
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,184
Rom, I was speaking
theoretically.

321
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,395
And I've put your theory
into practice.

322
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,231
All of Quark's employees
have joined.

323
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,734
We're going to force Quark
to treat us better...

324
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,152
I hope.

325
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,404
A union, huh?
Good for you.

326
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,989
You know about unions?

327
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,616
Who do you think led

328
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,159
the Pennsylvania coal miners

329
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,495
during the anthracite
strike of 1902?

330
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,830
I have no idea.

331
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,123
Sean Aloysius O'Brien.

332
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,959
I didn't know that.

333
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,461
There's a lot of things
about my family you don't know.

334
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:47,131
11 months those mines
were closed, and they
didn't open again

335
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,342
until all the miners'
demands were met.

336
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:53,220
You mean, we should force
Quark to close the bar.

337
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,931
Only as a last resort.

338
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,516
If he's reasonable
about your requests,

339
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,601
there's no
need to strike.

340
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:02,647
Quark reasonable?
Ha! Unlikely.

341
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:05,274
You'll have to strike--
mark my words--

342
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,819
and when you do,
you'll have to be strong.

343
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:11,030
Just like Sean O'Brien.
Exactly.

344
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,407
You know, he had
the biggest funeral

345
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,075
in all of western Pennsylvania.

346
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,911
Funeral?

347
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,914
Hmm. They fished his body
out of the Allegheny River

348
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,416
a week before the strike ended.

349
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,460
32 bullets he had in him.

350
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,380
Or was it 34?

351
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,841
Well, he died a hero.

352
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,425
He was more than a hero.

353
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,260
He was a union man.

354
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:48,108
I see the problem now.

355
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:51,529
You've got a bad ODN relay here.

356
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:54,156
We'll have to replace
the whole unit.

357
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,868
How long will it take?
Two to three hours.

358
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,619
But after that, it'll
work like a charm.

359
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,329
Until the next time
it breaks down.

360
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,331
Well, that's the problem
when you combine

361
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,084
Cardassian, Bajoran
and Federation technology.

362
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,127
None of it was meant
to work together.

363
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,338
How do you tolerate
working in this environment?

364
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,799
Well, it's a lot easier
than working on
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

365
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,344
Easier? The<i> Enterprise</i>
never had these kind
of problems.

366
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,930
Tell me about it.

367
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,057
Have you any idea

368
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:21,434
how bored I used to get
sitting in the transporter room,

369
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,603
waiting for something
to break down?

370
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,439
Here, I've half a dozen
new problems every day.

371
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,608
This station needs me.

372
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:31,986
Oh, do me a favor.
Hand me down the coil spanner?

373
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,418
Happy cleansing.

374
00:18:56,552 --> 00:19:01,265
If this is
a surprise birthday party,
you're a month late.

375
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:05,603
It's not a party.
We're the Guild of Restaurant
and Casino Employees,

376
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,730
and we're here
to present our demands.

377
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,442
The<i> Guild</i> of Restaurant
and Casino Employees?

378
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:13,402
What's that supposed to be?

379
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,654
What does it sound like?

380
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,614
It sounds like...

381
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,200
like a union.

382
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,786
Exactly.

383
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,705
So you'd better take
our demands seriously.

384
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,173
"Increased pay...

385
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,343
"Shorter hours...

386
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,720
(<i> laughing</i> ):
Paid sick leave..."

387
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,555
(<i> guffawing</i> )

388
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,974
This is no joke.

389
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,684
Yes, it is.

390
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,978
And the fact that you
don't know that it is,

391
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:48,562
is what makes it so funny.

392
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,317
Now get back to work
before I fire the lot of you.

393
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,944
You can't fire us.

394
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,112
Why not?

395
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,615
Because as of right now...

396
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,161
we're all on strike.

397
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:04,411
ALL:
Yeah!

398
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,750
(<i> laughing</i> )

399
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,142
ROM:
Thank you for not
patronizing Quark's.

400
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,519
Thanks very much.

401
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,647
Thank you for not
patronizing Quark's.

402
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,983
Thank you for not
patronizing Quark's.

403
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,443
Thank you for not patronizing
Quark's.

404
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,654
Thank you for not
patronizing Quark's.

405
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,531
I hope Rom's
voice holds out.

406
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:42,366
I hope our latinum holds out.

407
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,617
Ahh...

408
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,541
You wanted
to see me?

409
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,043
May I take your order, sir?

410
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,920
Quark, I'm in
no mood for games.

411
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,547
There seems to be an opening
at the dabo table,

412
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,174
or perhaps
I might interest you

413
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,842
in some time
in the holosuites.

414
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,219
(<i> glasses shatter</i> )

415
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,305
Not again.

416
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,979
Are you carrying a
tricorder or anything

417
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,355
with a portable
energy source?

418
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,774
What are you
talking about?

419
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,150
I'm still working
out the bugs

420
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,651
in these holographic
waiters.

421
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:20,654
The Lissepian who
sold me the program

422
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:23,532
neglected to mention
that certain energy sources

423
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,952
can interfere with
the imaging system.

424
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:29,371
Sounds like there's no end
to the problems you're facing.

425
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,457
I can take care
of the Lissepian.

426
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,960
I need you
to get those...

427
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,964
<i>traitors</i> away
from my front door.

428
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,591
They're blocking access
to my place of business,

429
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:43,177
causing a disturbance
on the Promenade,

430
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:46,555
<i>and</i> they're probably
a fire hazard.

431
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,600
They belong
in a holding cell!

432
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,811
Every last one of them.

433
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:55,815
Well, I hate to admit this,
but I agree with you.

434
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,234
From what Chief O'Brien
tells me about strikes,

435
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:01,612
they sound like trouble.
I don't like mobs.

436
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:05,992
In my opinion, if you need one
to get what you want,
it's not worth getting.

437
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:08,286
Good.
Then you'll haul them away.

438
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:10,412
I'll do nothing of the sort.
But you said...

439
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:13,540
I know what I said
but I have strict orders

440
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,459
from Captain Sisko not to...

441
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:19,463
<i>impinge</i> on your employees'
freedom of expression.

442
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,381
As long as they stay peaceful

443
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,967
and allow your customers access

444
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,718
through the second-level
entrance,

445
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,512
I'm not allowed
to interfere.

446
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:29,723
In that case,
would you mind
serving some drinks?

447
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,558
Huh!

448
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:32,935
I didn't think so.

449
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,895
(<i> loud crash</i> )

450
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,191
(<i> sighs</i> )

451
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,110
What about
the Vulcan?

452
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,445
With their sense of ethics,

453
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,281
definitely on the side
of labor.

454
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,991
Pass.

455
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,705
I say this one's
an "enter."

456
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,545
Lucky guess.

457
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,882
O'BRIEN:
Pass.

458
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,259
He barely set foot in there
when there wasn't a strike.

459
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:07,803
Mmm. Quark isn't exactly
his favorite person.

460
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:11,224
BASHIR:
Wait a minute.

461
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:13,100
I can't believe it.
He's an "enter."

462
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,102
Not for long.

463
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,478
Where are you going?

464
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,147
To talk some sense into him.

465
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,524
Commander! Hold on!

466
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:30,076
I cannot believe
what I'm seeing.

467
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,994
Sir. If I
could explain...

468
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:35,164
Mr. Worf, do I look like
I'm ready for an explanation?

469
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:38,458
Three of my senior staff,
brawling on the Promenade.

470
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,253
With all due respect, sir,
we, we weren't brawling.

471
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:41,628
Maybe you should take
a closer look

472
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,130
at Dr. Bashir's forehead.

473
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,508
Well, he shouldn't
have got in the way.

474
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,969
I was trying... I was trying
to<i> stop</i> the fight.

475
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,888
We were<i> not</i> fighting.

476
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,472
Then what were you doing?

477
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,974
Well, we...

478
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,559
Having a difference
of opinion.

479
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,144
Yeah, I suppose...

480
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,645
towards the end there,
we might have...

481
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,647
done a bit
of shoving.

482
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:03,567
According to Odo,
Dr. Bashir was shoved
over a table.

483
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,903
Now,<i> that</i>
was an accident.

484
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:09,365
It was just that things
got a little out of hand.

485
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,951
<i>Things</i> got more than
a little out of hand.

486
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,787
I suppose I'm going to have
to talk to Quark myself.

487
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,538
Find a way
to settle this strike,

488
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:19,166
get things back
to normal around here.

489
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,584
Uh, Captain?

490
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,712
Can we
leave now?

491
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:27,133
I'll tell Constable Odo
to let you go...

492
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,009
in the morning.

493
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,599
Well, I hope you're proud
of yourselves.

494
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,479
Captain, believe me--

495
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:44,024
I want this strike settled
as much as you do.

496
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,943
Then settle it.

497
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:48,904
It's not that simple.
Make it simple.

498
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,865
Sit down with your brother
and hammer out
an agreement today.

499
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:56,036
Captain, I'm afraid
you don't understand

500
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,831
what a delicate
situation this is.

501
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:02,835
Even talking with strikers
would be a violation

502
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:05,379
of the most sacred precepts
of Ferengi culture.

503
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:07,881
Maybe I don't know much
about Ferengi culture,

504
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:11,093
but I do know who holds
the lease on your bar.

505
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,553
The Federation.

506
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,806
And I couldn't ask
for better landlords.

507
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:18,225
That's because
we don't ask you
to pay your rent

508
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,478
or to reimburse us
for your maintenance repairs

509
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:23,105
or the drain
on the station's power supply.

510
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:25,899
You're a very generous people.

511
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,443
Until today.

512
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:30,946
Let's see.

513
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,324
Five years
of back rent,

514
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:36,994
plus power consumption,
plus repairs...

515
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:39,705
Do you know how
much latinum that is?

516
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,332
A lot.
That's right.

517
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:42,624
I'll talk to my brother.

518
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,960
I'm glad we're
in agreement.

519
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,130
Labor... Labor...

520
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,589
Where's wages?

521
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,675
Wages are here.
Oh, wages...

522
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:52,968
(<i> door chimes</i> )

523
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,720
Come in.

524
00:25:58,391 --> 00:25:59,766
What do you want?

525
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:02,728
Here.

526
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,315
What's this?

527
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:08,067
It's the amount of latinum

528
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,236
I'm willing to transfer
into your private account

529
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:12,405
if you'll just
end this strike.

530
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:18,452
Are we talking about
slips, strips or bars?

531
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:19,745
Slips.

532
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,038
(<i> exhales sharply</i> )

533
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:23,916
All right, strips.

534
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,293
It wouldn't matter
if it were bars.

535
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:30,464
I'm not going to end the strike
unless you meet our demands.

536
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:33,092
Rom, we shouldn't be fighting--
we're brothers.

537
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,010
Not when it comes to business.

538
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,679
We're nothing
but employer and employee.

539
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,681
You've said so yourself.

540
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,683
I was wrong.

541
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,769
No.

542
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,438
You weren't.

543
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:50,401
Rom, can't we talk about this?

544
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:52,445
There's only one thing
I have to say to you.

545
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:59,701
"Workers of
the world unite.

546
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:03,705
You have nothing to lose
but your chains."

547
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,917
What's happened to you?

548
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:26,103
Ah.

549
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:28,772
It's about time
you got back.

550
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,524
Brunt.

551
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:33,444
That's Liquidator
Brunt to you.

552
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:35,362
I see you
remember me.

553
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:38,407
Who could forget?
What do you want?

554
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:42,035
Quark, don't worry.
I'm here to help.

555
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,871
The Ferengi Commerce Authority
has ordered me to end

556
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:48,250
this nasty little
labor dispute of yours.

557
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,710
How do you propose to do that?

558
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,465
By any means necessary.

559
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:07,436
I hear Quark had only
14 customers all day.

560
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:09,563
And he'll have
even less tomorrow.

561
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:11,731
I've been talking
with people all over
the station,

562
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,609
and support for our
cause is growing.

563
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,693
Quark will have
to settle--

564
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:18,531
either that or go
out of business.

565
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:19,990
(<i> laughter</i> )

566
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,783
GRIMP:
I don't know.

567
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,701
Quark can be
awful stubborn.

568
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:25,912
I think he'd rather lose
the bar than give in to us.

569
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,623
Don't be such a pessimist.

570
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:30,209
Remember Rule
of Acquisition 263:

571
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:33,671
"Never allow doubt to tarnish
your lust for latinum."

572
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:37,757
Your brother can quote
Rules of Acquisition, too.

573
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,926
I believe his
favorite is 211:

574
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:43,222
"Employees are the rungs
on the ladder of success.

575
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,307
Don't hesitate
to step on them."

576
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,017
My<i> ex-brother</i>

577
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:49,019
wasn't quoting the
Rules of Acquisition

578
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,812
when he came to
see me yesterday.

579
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,314
Hmm. What did he say?

580
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,982
He offered me a bribe

581
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,276
<i>if</i> I would end
the strike.

582
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,237
Did you take it?
No, I didn't take it!

583
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:01,907
Don't you see what that means?
He's getting desperate.

584
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,117
A few more days and we'll get
everything we want.

585
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,619
(<i> electrical humming</i> )

586
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,547
Brunt.

587
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:19,132
FCA.

588
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,718
It's not my fault!

589
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:22,094
They made me do it!

590
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,263
It was all his idea!

591
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:25,514
Forgive me!

592
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:28,850
If this were Ferenginar...

593
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,270
I'd have you all taken

594
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,731
to the spire
of the Tower of Commerce,

595
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:35,399
displayed
to the crowds

596
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,776
in the Great
Marketplace below,

597
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:43,156
and then shoved off...
one by one!

598
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:46,118
Small children would bet
on where you would land,

599
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,245
and your spattered remains
would be sold

600
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:51,123
as feed mulch
for gree worms.

601
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:55,127
Spare me. I'm old.
I'm fragile.

602
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,670
(<i> coughs</i> )

603
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,923
I'll push the rest
of them off myself.

604
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:03,009
I thought you said you
weren't afraid of the FCA.

605
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,637
I lied.

606
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:06,722
Don't let him intimidate you.

607
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,474
We're not on Ferenginar.

608
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:11,226
Lucky for you.

609
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:14,271
But the FCA understands

610
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:17,566
that living
on this station has...

611
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:22,070
c-corrupted you.

612
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,532
You've been tempted
by unwholesome Bajoran ideals,

613
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,076
exposed to the
twisted values

614
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,704
of the Federation,
and because of that,

615
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:33,540
we are willing to forgive.

616
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,125
Really?

617
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:38,462
But don't
confuse our mercy
with weakness.

618
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:41,423
If you are not back at
your jobs tomorrow morning,

619
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,634
your financial accounts
on Ferenginar

620
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:46,720
will be confiscated,
your families will be fined

621
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,889
and your trading
permits revoked.

622
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,142
You'll be ruined...

623
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:55,270
reduced to utter

624
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,648
destitution.

625
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:00,734
Am I...
understood?

626
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,363
Good.

627
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,324
I thought so.

628
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,370
Don't bother getting up.

629
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:22,339
Would you get up?

630
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,008
Come on.

631
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,677
Let him stay there.

632
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:28,679
That's where
he belongs.

633
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:32,641
The question is:
Where do<i> we</i> belong?

634
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:35,977
On our knees... like Frool?

635
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:39,690
Or standing tall
like Sean O'Brien?

636
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,609
Who's Sean O'Brien?
He was a union man--

637
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,821
a man who gave his life
to earn a decent wage

638
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,197
for his fellow workers.

639
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:49,032
Brunt wouldn't have
intimidated him,

640
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,659
and he won't intimidate me.

641
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,828
What about our accounts
on Ferenginar?

642
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,913
If your accounts on Ferenginar
were worth anything,

643
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,540
you wouldn't be working
as a waiter.

644
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,084
I'm telling you--
nothing has changed.

645
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:01,002
Victory is within our grasp.

646
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:04,339
All we have to do is take it.

647
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,465
(<i> mutters of agreement</i> )

648
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:06,925
Now, are you with me?

649
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,134
Yes!

650
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,011
I said are
you with me?

651
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,680
ALL:
Yes!

652
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,432
Then let's get back
on that picket line

653
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,392
and show Quark
what we're made of.

654
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,060
(<i> all cheering</i> )

655
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,863
Can I get up now?

656
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,615
Look sharp now.

657
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,283
No slouching.

658
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,826
Remember...

659
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:35,788
in unity,
there is strength.

660
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:38,123
So be strong.

661
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,924
Chief, may I
speak with you?

662
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:48,759
Sure.
What's on your mind?

663
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:50,761
I feel I owe
you an apology.

664
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:53,931
I allowed our
argument in Quark's
to get out of hand.

665
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:56,516
I think there was plenty
of blame to spread around.

666
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,936
Nonetheless, we<i> are</i>
Starfleet officers,

667
00:32:58,936 --> 00:33:02,021
and Starfleet officers do
not brawl with each other.

668
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,607
It wasn't much
of a brawl, really.

669
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:05,275
I grabbed you,
you shoved me,

670
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,778
and Julian was tossed
over a table.

671
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:09,655
Well, it never
should have happened,

672
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:11,824
and under normal
circumstances
it never would have,

673
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:15,702
but there's something
about this station
I find... unsettling.

674
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:19,038
You'll get used to it.
Perhaps.

675
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,875
But in the meantime, I think
I've found a solution.

676
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,753
I'm going to move my
quarters to the<i>  Defiant.</i>

677
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:26,505
You're going to live
on the<i> Defiant?</i>

678
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,757
I've already discussed it
with Captain Sisko.

679
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:32,594
And he said yes?
As long as it doesn't
interfere with my duties.

680
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:36,055
But... you'll be living
out there all by yourself.

681
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:40,185
I know.

682
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,899
That was pretty impressive--
standing up to Brunt
the way you did.

683
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,443
Who'd have thought
I had such natural
leadership skills?

684
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,153
Oh, I knew it all along.

685
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,404
Really?

686
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,365
No.

687
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,116
I didn't think so.

688
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,118
Well, you surprised
a lot of people,

689
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,578
including me.

690
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,373
I've got to get ready.

691
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,500
I'm having dinner
with Julian.

692
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,711
He's a lucky man.

693
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:08,547
And almost as
brave as you are.

694
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,147
Psst. Rom.

695
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,736
She kissed me.

696
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:32,487
There's no accounting
for taste.

697
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,489
Rom, we have to talk.

698
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,366
Are you ready to give
in to our demands?

699
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:37,701
Of course not.

700
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:40,245
Then there's nothing
to talk about.

701
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,455
There's plenty
to talk about.

702
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,457
The FCA's
involved now.

703
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,877
And those Nausicaans
working for Brunt
aren't just for show.

704
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:49,212
I'm not going to let
Brunt intimidate me.

705
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,174
Don't you see, Rom?

706
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,927
You should be
intimidated.

707
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:56,845
There's no telling
what Brunt might do,

708
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:59,180
and I don't want
you to get hurt.

709
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,808
You never cared what
happened to me before.

710
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,977
I always cared
about you.

711
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:06,145
I tried to protect you.
Save you from yourself.

712
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:08,982
How? By telling me I was
an idiot my whole life?

713
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:11,610
I had to be tough on you.
I was trying to make
you a better Ferengi.

714
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:15,280
What you were trying to do
was make yourself
feel important.

715
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,157
Making me feel dumb
made you feel smart.

716
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:22,203
But I'm<i> not</i> dumb,
and you're not half as smart
as you think you are.

717
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:25,624
Rom, you have
to listen to me.

718
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:28,668
The FCA doesn't have
to answer to anyone.

719
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:33,131
And if Brunt decides
to get rid of you,

720
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,634
I won't be able
to stop him.

721
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,263
Look at it this way.

722
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,515
If Brunt gets rid of me,

723
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,477
then all your problems
are solved.

724
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:48,187
You always said you wanted
to be an only child.

725
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,536
Doesn't that hurt?

726
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,580
I'm sure it does.

727
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,125
Most Nausicaan games do.

728
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:11,753
Speaking of pain...

729
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:13,463
did you talk
to your brother?

730
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:15,632
We talked.
And?

731
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:17,592
I need more time.

732
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,804
Time, like latinum,
is a highly limited commodity.

733
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:23,431
Look, you're here
to help me, right?

734
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,184
Wrong. I'm here
to enforce Ferengi law

735
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,269
and to protect
Ferengi tradition,

736
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,605
and that means putting
an end to this strike.

737
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:37,320
Now, I can see that we are
going to have to make...

738
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,324
an example of someone.

739
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,076
What kind of example?

740
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:46,454
Oh, I'm sure that we'll
come up with something

741
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:50,167
that will get
people's attention.

742
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:54,253
I, uh,... don't want
my brother hurt.

743
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,381
Oh, I wasn't
thinking of him.

744
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:59,342
Attack the leader
of a movement, you risk
creating a martyr.

745
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,804
No, Rom must not be touched.

746
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:05,640
Our target must be someone...

747
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,433
unexpected.

748
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,936
Someone he cares about...

749
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,604
like that dabo girl.

750
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,815
Leeta.

751
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:16,026
But she's not even Ferengi.
I know.

752
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:18,653
That's what makes it
so memorable.

753
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,364
But she has such...

754
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,241
delicate lobes.

755
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,078
I'm afraid I couldn't bring
myself to give the order.

756
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:28,371
No, let's see.

757
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,498
Who else...

758
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:34,169
does Rom care about?

759
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,591
Boys?

760
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:45,555
Me?

761
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,682
But I'm on your side.

762
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,226
Ironic...

763
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:50,977
isn't it?

764
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:06,284
I thought I wasn't allowed
to have any visitors.

765
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,620
Dr. Bashir
made an exception.

766
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:11,706
He said you were
almost killed.

767
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,417
It's nothing to smile about.

768
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,837
Those Nausicaans shattered
my left eye socket,

769
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,298
broke two of my
ascending ribs

770
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,467
and punctured my lower lung.

771
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:26,679
If Odo hadn't come
along when he did...

772
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,764
Does it hurt?

773
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:30,767
Of course it hurts.

774
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,310
Too bad.

775
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,856
If you're going to
stand there and gloat,
you can leave right now.

776
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:40,485
I'm not done gloating.
Don't you get it?

777
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,988
This was a message for you.

778
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:44,781
Well, it's not going to work.

779
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:46,532
(<i> gasping</i> )

780
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:49,494
I wish Brunt
had known that.

781
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,871
Odo has him and the Nausicaans
in a holding cell.

782
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,748
He says it's
an open-and-shut case.

783
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,708
It's an open-and-shut
case, all right,

784
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,710
but I'm not going
to press charges.

785
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,838
You're not?
Of course not.

786
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:02,799
I'm in enough trouble
with the FCA as it is.

787
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:04,676
But then Odo will
have to let them go.

788
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,385
Either way, the FCA

789
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:09,514
will just send
another Liquidator,

790
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:12,433
and that one
<i>will</i> make
an example of you.

791
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,644
Then you'll be
the one gloating.

792
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:17,355
I don't want to gloat.

793
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,065
I want to end the strike.

794
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:22,027
So, give us what we want.
Rom, I can't!

795
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:24,988
I'm not going against 10,000
years of Ferengi tradition.

796
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:27,406
You're just afraid
of the FCA.

797
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:30,035
Of course, I'm afraid
of the FCA.

798
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:32,537
They crushed my eye socket.

799
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:36,749
And if you had any sense,
you'd be afraid of them, too.

800
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,919
If this strike
doesn't get settled soon,

801
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,754
we're both going
to find ourselves

802
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,049
tossed out
of the nearest airlock.

803
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:46,759
You<i> have</i> to
dissolve the union.

804
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,430
(<i> exhales sharply</i> )

805
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,518
At least officially.

806
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,730
What do you mean?

807
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,648
I mean...

808
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,448
I mean, you
dissolve the union--

809
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,868
make it look like I've won--

810
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:15,454
and I'll give you
<i>everything</i> you want.

811
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:17,040
You'll meet our demands?

812
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,666
That's what I just said,
you idiot.

813
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,252
Even sick leave?

814
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:22,461
Even sick leave.

815
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:25,257
And six months
from now,

816
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:27,884
when the FCA isn't
watching my books so closely,

817
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,468
you'll get your raises.

818
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:32,055
Six months!
It's the best I can do!

819
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:34,515
No, it's not.
All you have to do
is make up

820
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,559
one of your fake
business ledgers for the FCA.

821
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,144
They'll never
know the difference.

822
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,562
Shh!

823
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,402
All right.

824
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:48,196
You'll get your raises
by the end of the week,

825
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:51,783
but the union dies here...

826
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,701
today...

827
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:57,663
and that's my final offer.

828
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,556
Better?

829
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,435
Much.

830
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:20,478
I thought about
getting you a plant,

831
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,647
but somehow
it didn't seem right.

832
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,774
A wise decision.

833
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:26,985
So I brought you
this instead.

834
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:33,158
It's a collection of
my favorite Klingon operas.

835
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:35,243
Think about it.
You can lie in bed

836
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,454
and pipe them through
the<i> Defiant's</i> com system

837
00:41:37,454 --> 00:41:40,123
and play them
as loud as you like.

838
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:41,874
A thoughtful gift.

839
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:49,632
You know, Worf,

840
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,968
in the end,
living on the<i> Defiant</i>

841
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:53,594
isn't going to change anything.

842
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,138
You're still going
to have to get used

843
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:56,431
to life on the station.

844
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:58,350
I am not sure I agree.

845
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:01,560
Sooner or later,
you're going to have to adapt.

846
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,064
Perhaps in the end,
it'll be all of you

847
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,565
that have to adapt to me.

848
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:15,283
Come in! Come in!

849
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:16,909
Welcome back.

850
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,744
Why don't you
try your luck
at the dabo wheel?

851
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,872
Remember,
every Bajoran gets
one free spin.

852
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,040
You're in a good mood.

853
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,458
I just got a raise.

854
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:26,627
Major!

855
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,339
I must say
you are looking

856
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:31,341
particularly
cleansed today.

857
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:33,968
Just get me two
mugs of synthale,

858
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,888
a double order
of<i> hasperat,</i> and, uh...

859
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,431
hold the conversation?

860
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,476
No wonder I missed you.

861
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:46,356
Ah! Rom,
there you are.

862
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:48,983
Why aren't you in
your waiter's uniform?

863
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,903
I'll have a large
snail juice, please,
straight up.

864
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:53,571
You know there's no
drinking on the job.

865
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,365
That's no way to talk
to a customer.

866
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:57,658
You're not a customer,
you're an employee.

867
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,202
Not anymore.

868
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,787
I've wiped my last table

869
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,622
and mixed my last Black Hole.

870
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,833
Starting today,
I'm one of the station's

871
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:09,712
diagnostic and repair
technicians, junior grade...

872
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,672
night shift.

873
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:17,011
You're quitting?

874
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,804
Effective immediately.

875
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:23,518
I gave you
everything you wanted.

876
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,437
I know, but if the strike
taught me anything,

877
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:28,022
it's that I do a lot better
when you're not around.

878
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:31,568
Don't worry.
I'll keep your
holosuites running

879
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:33,903
and fix your replicators
when they're broken.

880
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:36,281
I think this'll be really
good for our relationship.

881
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:41,453
I don't.
Think about it from
my point of view.

882
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:44,289
If I keep working for you,
all I have to look forward to

883
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:47,708
is waiting for you to die
so I can inherit the bar.

884
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,002
Well, I don't want you to die.

885
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:54,006
And besides, I deserve
to have a life of my own now.

886
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,800
But without me
looking after you...

887
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,343
I'll do fine.

888
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,722
I suppose you will.

889
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,643
I'll miss you.
No, you won't.

890
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:09,814
I'll be here all the time,
only I'll be a paying customer.

891
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:13,276
Now, get me my snail juice...

892
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:15,403
Brother.

893
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:17,696
Coming up.

894
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:27,415
(<i> sighs</i> )
