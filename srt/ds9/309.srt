1
00:00:01,794 --> 00:00:05,046
Kira, we've got six
Byzatium transports
coming in this afternoon.

2
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:06,799
I've<i> got</i> to have
more cargo space.

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,634
(<i> sighs</i> )
All right, have them off-load

4
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:10,135
into Cargo Bays 3 and 4,
but that's it.

5
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:13,221
We are pushing
our storage capacity as it is.

6
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:15,557
Well, that reminds me--
we got a message last night
saying the Byzallians

7
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,267
want to move their
conference up by a week.

8
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,020
(<i> sighs heavily</i> )

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,731
I haven't had a chance to read
through last night's reports.

10
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,024
Is there anything else
I should know?

11
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:28,654
Well, um...
What?

12
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,240
Starfleet wants
a complete report done

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,368
on our computer
calibration subroutine.

14
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,537
The whole subroutine?

15
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,163
When?

16
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,832
Tomorrow.

17
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,756
(<i> sighs</i> )

18
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:51,134
Major, the scheduled
transport's been delayed,

19
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,387
and I need those medical
supplies by the end of the week.

20
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:54,763
We can't spare a runabout

21
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,765
to go all the way
to Vulcan right now.

22
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,726
I'm supposed to be setting up
a field hospital

23
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,227
for a new colony
on Campor III next week.

24
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,021
And if I don't get
those medical supplies,

25
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:03,689
then the entire
colonization schedule

26
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:04,899
could be set back
by at least...

27
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:06,316
Listen to me!

28
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,736
You can't have
a runabout.

29
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,779
You cannot get
your medical supplies

30
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,407
and I don't give a damn about
the colonization schedule!

31
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,909
Those colonists can make do

32
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,618
with a box of bandages
for all I care.

33
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,787
Stop right there,
Major.

34
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,463
When was your last day off?

35
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,131
I don't know.

36
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,926
What does that have to do
with anything?

37
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:34,929
If you can't remember,
then it's been too long.

38
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,348
You're off duty,
as of this moment.

39
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,351
What do you mean
I'm off duty?

40
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,604
You can't do that.

41
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,564
Oh, yes, I can, and not
even Commander Sisko

42
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:48,067
can overrule my judgment
as Chief Medical Officer.

43
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:53,280
Now... now, wait
a minute, Julian.

44
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,990
Just because I snapped...

45
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,911
My diagnosis is
that you are overworked,

46
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:01,580
and suffering
from extreme stress

47
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,749
and borderline exhaustion.

48
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:06,293
As for my prescription...

49
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:09,212
Follow me.

50
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,558
<i>Karvino</i> juice,

51
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,852
Lorvan crackers,

52
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,854
a holosuite program,

53
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,732
a<i> jumja</i> stick
and gambling tokens.

54
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,151
Now, at least two
of these items

55
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,361
must be used and fully enjoyed
before you leave this facility.

56
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,613
Julian, I...

57
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,281
I'll be giving you
a full report

58
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,783
of her activities, Doctor.

59
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,326
And if I hear you
didn't completely relax

60
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,953
and enjoy yourself
tonight,

61
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,579
we'll do this every
night until you do.

62
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,914
(<i> sighs</i> )

63
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,749
Have fun!

64
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:02,141
MAN:
Looks like you've got
your evening all planned.

65
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:04,893
Hope you've got room
for the unexpected.

66
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,059
Welcome aboard, Commander.
Thank you.

67
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:12,020
Call me Will.

68
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,857
What brings you
to Deep Space 9?
Strictly pleasure.

69
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,776
Actually, I have built up
about three months of leave,

70
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,028
and Dr. Crusher finally insisted
that I take some of it.

71
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,614
She nearly shoved me
out of the airlock.
(<i> laughs</i> )

72
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:25,617
Well, DS9 isn't exactly
known as a vacation spot.

73
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,410
Actually, I was just
passing through

74
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,663
on my way to Risa.
The last time I was here,

75
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,332
I was only able to spend
a couple of hours at Quark's.

76
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,793
But by the time I left,
I had all of his latinum

77
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,544
and a date
with one of his dabo girls,

78
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,546
so I thought
I might try my luck again.

79
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,590
You be careful.

80
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,843
Quark's dabo wheel's been
a little stingy lately

81
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,804
and one of his dabo girls
is dating my son.

82
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,015
In that case, I
think I'd better

83
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,348
spend my time
in the holosuite.

84
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,143
It sounds safer,
all the way around.

85
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,234
Who's in there?

86
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:03,362
What?
Who's in with Benjamin?

87
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:07,575
Oh, it's Will... Commander
Will Riker from the<i> Enterprise.</i>

88
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,411
Will Riker?

89
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,664
You know him?

90
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:13,957
Yeah.

91
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,043
I met him a year ago
at Quark's.

92
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,627
He's, uh, quite
a dabo player.

93
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,046
Hmm.

94
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,964
Do you know him?

95
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,716
Yes, a little.

96
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:26,678
I met him at Quark's last night.

97
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,264
You met him
last night, and...?

98
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,557
And we talked.

99
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,810
And then?

100
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,688
And then we talked.

101
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,440
For three hours.

102
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,776
No, we just talked.

103
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:45,072
And, yes, he's a warm,
charming man...

104
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,324
but I'm involved with someone.

105
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,576
Of course.

106
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:56,250
So why do you keep glancing
back at Sisko's office?

107
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,918
SISKO:
If you can find the time,

108
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,087
you have an open invitation
for dinner with me and Jake.

109
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,172
Thank you. I may
take you up on that.

110
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,091
I hope you're not
here for another loan.

111
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,800
Don't tell me
you've forgotten

112
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,635
who staked you three
strips of latinum

113
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,304
when your winning
streak ran dry.

114
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,098
I'm sorry.
Of course.

115
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,599
Most of that night's
still a blur.

116
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:13,600
How have you been, Dax?

117
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,809
Fine.

118
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:15,936
Well, I'd better
get out of your way.

119
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,520
I know you all
have work to do.

120
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,980
Hope to see
you again.

121
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,981
Major.

122
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,566
Commander.

123
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,170
Oh!
Oh!

124
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,838
I'm sorry.
That's all right.

125
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,840
My mind was a million
light-years away.

126
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,926
I should have been paying
attention to where I was going.

127
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,677
You doing
some shopping?

128
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,512
Well, actually, I was just
exploring the Promenade.

129
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,556
I'd thought about
going into Quark's,

130
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,475
but I wasn't really
in the mood.

131
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,477
Where are you off to?
I'm just getting
off duty.

132
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,605
I was about
to call it a night.
Oh, I see.

133
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,565
Well, good night.

134
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,235
Good night.

135
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,696
Commander?

136
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,159
Would you like a tour
of the station?

137
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,996
I'd love one.
Where should we begin?

138
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,790
We can walk along
the Promenade
for a start.

139
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,583
There's quite a bit
to see here.

140
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,043
You think we might
get a chance

141
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,837
to look at that new
starship of yours?

142
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,922
What do you call it, the...
Oh, the<i> Defiant.</i>

143
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,258
Yes, the<i> Defiant.</i> 
I understand
it's quite a vessel.

144
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,926
I'm sure that
can be arranged.

145
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:44,858
COMPUTER:
Please identify
for access to USS<i> Defiant.</i>

146
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,735
Major Kira Nerys,
Bajoran militia.

147
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:48,987
Identity confirmed.

148
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,241
Commander William Riker,
Starfleet.

149
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,160
Identity confirmed.

150
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,880
(<i> electronic instrument humming)</i>

151
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,842
Chief, I didn't
know anyone else

152
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,344
was on board tonight.

153
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:15,263
Oh, I hadn't planned to.
Ouch!

154
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,432
I was just getting
a little extra work done

155
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,976
on the deflector
targeting arrays.

156
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:25,065
Commander...
I'd heard you were aboard,
but I-I hadn't...

157
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,941
There's nothing to say
to you, O'Brien.

158
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,609
I think you know why.

159
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:33,407
Well, maybe we should
come back another time.

160
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,783
No, no, no, Major,
it's all right.

161
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,702
I was just leaving.

162
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,122
Commander.

163
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,545
What was all that about?

164
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:47,670
Ah, it's a long story.

165
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,256
I'd rather not
get into it.

166
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,883
Let's take a look
at this ship of yours.

167
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:55,011
Okay. I'll, uh, show you
the tactical systems first.

168
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,637
Think you're going
to be surprised

169
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,557
at how big a punch
this little ship has.

170
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,233
Running the plasma conduit

171
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,901
through your primary
phaser coupling

172
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,819
has almost doubled
your phaser power.

173
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,072
Doesn't that cut into
your warp drive efficiency?

174
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:17,909
Not at all, in fact,
it's 30% more efficient.

175
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,327
That's ingenious.

176
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,995
I'd like to see
how it's all routed

177
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,914
through the tactical display.

178
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,710
COMPUTER:
Command authorization required.

179
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,754
New security procedure.

180
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,549
Computer,
release Bridge lockout.

181
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:36,386
Authorization: Kira
Delta-5-4-7-Alpha.

182
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,016
Thank you.

183
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,101
Ah!

184
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,952
(<i> alarm sounding</i> )
What's going on?

185
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,537
DAX:
I'm not sure, but
something happened

186
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,747
to the warp core
on the<i> Defiant.</i>

187
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,666
It looks like it's going
to breach in 57 seconds.

188
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,293
Anyone on board?

189
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,211
O'Brien was working
there this morning

190
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,213
but I don't know if he...

191
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,549
Incoming signal
from the<i> Defiant.</i> 
It's Commander Riker.

192
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,426
On screen.

193
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,136
RIKER:
Commander Sisko,
there's been an accident.

194
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,762
One of the plasma
conduits has exploded.

195
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,515
Major Kira has been injured.

196
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,891
We are 45 seconds
from a core breach.

197
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,852
Release the docking clamps.

198
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,104
I will get us away
from the station.

199
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,857
We'll beam the two of you out of
there as soon as you're clear.

200
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,275
Docking clamps released.

201
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,235
I'm engaging thrusters.

202
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,082
15 seconds.

203
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,750
Lock on and beam them
away, Chief.

204
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,378
I can't get a lock.

205
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:54,047
The<i> Defiant's</i>
shields are up.
What?

206
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,223
She's gone into warp.
I've lost them.

207
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,565
We're beyond
their sensor range.

208
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,024
Lay in a course for the
Badlands, warp seven.

209
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,651
Tamal, secure that conduit.

210
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,194
Right.

211
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,487
Course laid in.

212
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:20,031
We'll be in the Badlands
in six hours.

213
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,294
You did it, Tom.

214
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,380
It's not over yet.

215
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,350
Nine years ago
a transporter accident

216
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,603
created two
William T. Rikers.

217
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,770
One of them returned
to his ship,

218
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,856
the other was marooned
on Nervala IV.

219
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,235
The second Riker was
finally discovered

220
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,486
two years ago.

221
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,863
He chose to use his
middle name, Thomas,

222
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,907
to distinguish himself
from the other Riker.

223
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,993
The two men are physically
identical in all respects,

224
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,829
right down
to their DNA coding.

225
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,749
There was no way
for the security computer

226
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:13,501
to know that it was
Thomas, not William,

227
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,629
who boarded
the<i> Defiant.</i>

228
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:18,423
This is
a very entertaining story,

229
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:21,384
but... why am
I listening to it?

230
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,640
We have reason
to believe

231
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,808
that Thomas Riker is
a member of the Maquis.

232
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,439
What?

233
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,774
ODO:
Thomas Riker

234
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:38,526
was serving aboard
the starship<i> Gandhi.</i>

235
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,028
While he was there,
he began to express

236
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,030
certain political opinions,

237
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:47,118
opinions that supported
the Maquis and their goals.

238
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:50,747
Are you telling me...

239
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:57,128
that one of the most heavily
armed warships in this Quadrant

240
00:13:57,128 --> 00:14:00,839
is now in the hands
of Maquis terrorists?

241
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,096
(<i> sighs</i> )

242
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:14,479
Do you have any idea
what kind of response

243
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,940
this will provoke
from the Central Command?

244
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,984
They'll probably want
to send ships

245
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,778
into the
Demilitarized Zone

246
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,154
to conduct a search.

247
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,947
We understand that,

248
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,784
but any entry into the Zone
must be a joint operation

249
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,745
between Cardassia
and the Federation.

250
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:34,248
The Central Command
will not be interested

251
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:37,418
in any joint operation,
Commander.

252
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,504
They won't believe
your story

253
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:46,553
about transporter duplicates
and security failures.

254
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,848
They will assume
that Starfleet

255
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:53,100
wanted the Maquis
to have the<i> Defiant,</i>

256
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,688
and they will
respond accordingly.

257
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,898
And what does that
mean exactly?

258
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,819
It means they will seize
this opportunity

259
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,864
to finally eliminate
the Maquis.

260
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:09,325
They will send a fleet
into that Zone.

261
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,874
Starfleet will cooperate
in a search for the<i> Defiant,</i>

262
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:18,877
but they will not allow
the Central Command

263
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:22,839
to use this as an excuse
for a full-scale invasion.

264
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,049
Of course not.

265
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,677
So you will send your
own fleet into the Zone

266
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,471
to protect
Federation colonies.

267
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,516
But at some point,
the two fleets will meet,

268
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:37,562
tensions will rise,
nerves will fray,

269
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:41,524
and someone will make
the tiniest mistake.

270
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:44,068
And we'll have a war
on our hands.

271
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:47,363
It is a prospect I do
not relish, Commander.

272
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,698
Neither do we.

273
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,410
That's why we need
to work together

274
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,245
to prevent it
from happening.

275
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:55,914
Well, unless
I can bring

276
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:58,249
something back
to Central Command

277
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,126
to prove your good faith,

278
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:03,379
and your willingness
to help stop the<i> Defiant,</i>

279
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,424
I don't believe anything
can prevent this conflict

280
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,259
from beginning.

281
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,219
Then bring me with you.

282
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,722
I can help you stop
the<i> Defiant</i>

283
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,682
and prove our good faith.

284
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,351
I was in charge
of the shipyard

285
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,561
where the<i> Defiant</i>
was built.

286
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,230
I helped design it.

287
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,190
I know her
vulnerabilities

288
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,776
and her weaknesses.

289
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:28,738
You'll help us destroy
one of your own ships?

290
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,407
I want to try and
disable it first.

291
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,034
Oh, I'm sure you do.

292
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:42,585
But you are in no position
to bargain here, Commander.

293
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,296
You want to prevent a war,

294
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:50,384
you come back to Cardassia
with me, and you help me

295
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:54,138
destroy the<i> Defiant.</i>

296
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:07,109
I don't care who you are
or what your name is.

297
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:11,656
I am sorry about lying to you,
and I'm sorry about using you.

298
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,240
It was an
operational necessity!

299
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,368
You were
a resistance fighter.

300
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,078
You know that certain times
you do things that
you're not proud of

301
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,580
to accomplish the mission.

302
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,042
Well, you accomplished
your mission, so now what?

303
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,711
Everyone's going
to be looking for you.

304
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,462
The Cardassians and Starfleet.

305
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,381
How far do you think you're
going to get with this ship

306
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,632
before they find you?

307
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:32,092
A lot farther
than people anticipate.

308
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,636
Kalita to Riker.

309
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:34,888
We've reached
the rendezvous point.

310
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,890
I'm on my way.

311
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,024
The other Maquis
ships just arrived.

312
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,483
The rest of
the team's ready.

313
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,193
Lower the shields
and beam them aboard.

314
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,823
The Maquis ships

315
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:56,409
are heading
for the border, Tom.
All defense systems

316
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,703
on line and operational.
Warp power standing by.

317
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:03,917
Lay in a course for the
Cardassian border, warp eight.

318
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,335
Course already laid in.

319
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,629
This ship was built to fight.

320
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,424
I think it's time
she got her chance.

321
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,884
Engage.

322
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:20,099
SISKO:
<i>Commander's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 48467.3.</i>

323
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,852
<i>Gul Dukat and I have arrived</i>
<i>on Cardassia Prime.</i>

324
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:25,438
<i>I'm about to do something</i>
<i>which goes against 20 years</i>

325
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,440
<i>of Starfleet training--</i>

326
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,068
<i>help an enemy hunt down</i>
<i>one of our own ships.</i>

327
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:32,236
This is where I'll be
conducting the search

328
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,114
for the<i> Defiant.</i>

329
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,199
From this room,
I can control

330
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,703
every Cardassian
ship, outpost,

331
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,039
and space station
anywhere in our...

332
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,749
(<i> door opening</i> )

333
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:51,171
DUKAT:
Ah, Commander, allow me
to introduce Korinas,

334
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:54,300
our observer from
the Obsidian Order.

335
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,468
Commander Sisko.

336
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,677
Korinas.

337
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,472
Welcome to Cardassia
Prime, Commander.

338
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,640
Thank you.

339
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,101
Excuse me.

340
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:06,604
Secure that console
while the human is here.

341
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:09,816
Anything else classified
level 4 or above

342
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,692
should also be secured.

343
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,322
I'm sure you can understand

344
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,574
that although we all respect
Gul Dukat's decision

345
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:22,328
to bring you here,
we must take some precautions.

346
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,204
Of course.

347
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,498
I would have done the same.

348
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,293
But then...
I would have been
more discreet.

349
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,171
Since you are here

350
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,675
to provide technical expertise
on the<i> Defiant,</i>

351
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,052
I suggest you begin
by briefing us

352
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,638
on the ship's
defensive capabilities.

353
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:44,433
Please, describe for us
in detail

354
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,644
the weapons systems
of the<i> Defiant,</i>

355
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,813
beginning with
the ship's phaser array...

356
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:52,025
Before we discuss weaponry,
there's a more urgent matter

357
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,234
that I think
you should be aware of.

358
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,487
The<i> Defiant</i> is equipped
with a cloaking device.

359
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,281
I wondered if you
were going to share

360
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,283
that little detail with us.

361
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,535
You knew about this?

362
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,996
The Obsidian Order
has known for some time

363
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,539
about the loan
of a cloaking device

364
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,666
from the Romulans
to the Federation.

365
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:12,045
And the Order chose not
to share this intelligence

366
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,880
with the Central Command?

367
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,299
Until now, the Order had not
considered this one cloak

368
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,218
to be a threat
against Cardassia.

369
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,928
(<i> snorts</i> )

370
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,014
Under our terms of agreement
with the Romulans,

371
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:24,640
the cloaking device
was to be used

372
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,518
only in the Gamma Quadrant,
and then only in exchange

373
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:30,270
for all our intelligence
reports on the Dominion.

374
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,940
Well, your Lieutenant
Riker isn't likely

375
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,776
to respect that agreement
with the Romulans,

376
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,570
and there's no way

377
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,488
to locate a ship
under cloak.

378
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,407
There is
one possibility.

379
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:44,535
The Dominion managed
to penetrate the cloak

380
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:47,287
by using some kind
of antiproton beam.

381
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:50,041
Can you give us the
specifications of that beam?

382
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,959
Not precisely,
but I can give you

383
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,545
everything we've learned
from our sensor logs.

384
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,923
It'll give you a chance
to find the<i> Defiant</i>

385
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,382
before she attacks.

386
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,803
(<i> console beeping</i> )

387
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,555
We're approaching
the security perimeter, Tom.

388
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,766
All right, this is it.

389
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,185
Red alert.

390
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,978
Cloak the ship.

391
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,605
Stand by, weapons.

392
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:26,119
Squadron Baker
has arrived

393
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,286
at their checkpoint.

394
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,288
Transmit the
go-ahead signal.

395
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:33,167
We'll be in Cardassian
sensor range in five minutes.

396
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:36,879
There is a perimeter alert
in the Almatha sector.

397
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,756
Put it on the main viewer.

398
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,724
Who's commanding the outpost
nearest that ship?

399
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,977
CREWMAN:
Gul Toran
of the Sixth Order.

400
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,311
And he's identified the vessel.

401
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,395
It's the<i> Defiant.</i>

402
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,689
Order all warships

403
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,276
in that sector
to converge on the<i> Defiant.</i>

404
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,279
Something's wrong.

405
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:05,574
Why wouldn't they
be cloaked?

406
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,244
Can you show me the sensor
information on the<i> Defiant?</i>

407
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,958
The<i> Defiant</i> is
attacking Outpost 61.

408
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,835
DUKAT:
Tell Gul Toran

409
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,045
that he has permission
to pursue the<i> Defiant</i>

410
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,630
into the Demilitarized Zone.

411
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,591
No, don't pull your ships
off the border.

412
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,384
Commander, you don't expect me

413
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,595
to break off pursuit
of the<i> Defiant</i>

414
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,639
simply because the treaty's...

415
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,808
That's<i> not</i> the<i> Defiant.</i>
It's a decoy.

416
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:33,227
They're trying to draw your
patrol ships out of position.

417
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,646
That ship's sending
out a fake warp signature

418
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:37,648
identical to the<i> Defiant's,</i>

419
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:40,276
but the phase variance and
subspace harmonics don't match.

420
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,696
Order Toran
to break off pursuit.

421
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,698
Have him redeploy...

422
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,658
Sir, another perimeter alert.

423
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,327
Outpost 47 has detected

424
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:51,453
a cloaked ship with
their antiproton beam.

425
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,666
Tell Toran to head
for Outpost 47.

426
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,584
The<i> Defiant</i> has de-cloaked

427
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,670
and has begun to
attack the outpost.

428
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:03,090
We've lost contact
with Outpost 47.

429
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,137
Incoming message from Gul Toran.

430
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,555
The<i> Defiant</i> has re-cloaked

431
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,183
and its last known heading
was 148

432
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,101
mark 215.

433
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:20,774
It's headed directly into the
heart of Cardassian territory.

434
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,903
KORINAS:
Commander Sisko,

435
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,779
you should be commended.

436
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,949
I only wish<i> we</i> had someone with
such keen tactical instincts

437
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,244
who could have prevented

438
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:33,704
this invasion of our territory.

439
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:46,466
We're past
the security perimeter,

440
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,927
out of their sensor range.

441
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,470
They're using antiproton
beams to scan for us.

442
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,056
Adjust the cloak's
resonance frequency

443
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,057
so they can't
detect us again.

444
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:54,392
Right.
Damage report.

445
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:56,102
We took six hits
on the port shields.

446
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:58,104
There's been
some minor damage

447
00:23:58,104 --> 00:23:59,939
to the outer hull, but all
systems are operational.

448
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,439
Tough little ship.

449
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,359
Set a course for the
shipyard at Omekla III.

450
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,484
We'll let that be
the place that...

451
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,737
(<i> alarm blares</i> )
Report.

452
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,489
We've lost main power,
and the cloak is off-line.

453
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,700
Looks like two plasma
conduits blew out.

454
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,993
Where?

455
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:16,038
Deck 3, section 15.

456
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,248
Crew quarters.

457
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:22,544
Looks like
Major Kira's been busy.

458
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,052
You crossed the replicator
power converter

459
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,220
with the plasma
manifold, I take it.

460
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,555
That's right.
Nice work.

461
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,808
You know I'll have that thing
bypassed in 30 minutes.

462
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,935
At least that'll be 30 minutes
that we're visible.

463
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:40,271
Fortunately, I was able
to take us into a nebula.

464
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:42,773
No one's going
to see us.

465
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,942
Thanks.

466
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:46,902
You're lucky you
only got singed.

467
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,904
You know, the whole plasma relay
could have exploded.

468
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,240
Yeah, that was the idea.

469
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,409
You've been fighting Cardassians
most of your life.

470
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,911
I know that you sympathize
with what we're doing here.

471
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,414
I fought the Cardassians
because they invaded my home.

472
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,749
You don't live
in the Demilitarized Zone.

473
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,752
You don't have family there.
Why are<i> you</i> in this fight?

474
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,588
Because people are dying
in the Demilitarized Zone

475
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,841
and Starfleet isn't doing
anything about it.

476
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,843
Taking the<i> Defiant</i>
only raises the stakes.

477
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,471
The Cardassians are going
to send a<i> fleet</i> after you.

478
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:15,806
They are going to kill
more people hunting you down

479
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:18,017
than they ever did
during those border raids.

480
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,852
You're assuming
the<i> Defiant</i> is going to stay

481
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,061
in the Demilitarized Zone.

482
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,896
Let's go to the Bridge.

483
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,898
I think we'd all feel better
having you someplace

484
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,109
we can keep an eye on you.

485
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:30,112
15 outposts
have checked in.

486
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,739
No sign of the<i> Defiant.</i>

487
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,409
26 warships have scanned

488
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:38,871
14 cubic light-years of space
with antiproton beams--

489
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,457
no<i> Defiant!</i>

490
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:42,958
What are the possibilities?

491
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,542
They're still under cloak

492
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,379
and heading deeper
into Cardassian space.

493
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:47,713
They're laying low

494
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:51,342
and waiting for
some unknown reason.

495
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:52,343
Dukat.

496
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:53,344
Hmm?

497
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:54,678
Are you listening to me?

498
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,680
Oh, I'm sorry, Commander.

499
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,766
I was thinking
about my son's birthday.

500
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,687
Really?

501
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:07,274
Yes, today is
his 11th birthday.

502
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,234
Oh.

503
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:10,110
I'd promised to take him

504
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,780
to the amusement center
in Lakarian City.

505
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,658
He always wanted to go...

506
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,953
but I never had the time.

507
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:27,378
I told him, "This year
will be different, Mekor.

508
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:31,465
This year,
I will<i> make</i> the time."

509
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:40,224
I had the same
experience with Jake.

510
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:44,144
At that age, they never
understand, do they?

511
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:47,481
You just hope
that, one day later

512
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:48,648
they'll look
back and say

513
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,319
"Now I understand.

514
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,988
Now I know why he did that."

515
00:26:57,116 --> 00:27:02,079
When my son looks back
on this day,

516
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,540
the only thing he'll remember

517
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:08,586
is that a Federation officer,
on a Federation ship

518
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:11,755
invaded his home

519
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:17,344
and kept his father away
from him on his 11th birthday,

520
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,347
and he won't look back
with understanding.

521
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:24,684
He'll look back with hatred...

522
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,855
and that's sad.

523
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,080
The cloak is operating
within normal parameters

524
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,458
but the plasma conduit damage

525
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:49,502
has caused a slight neutrino
leak in the port nacelle.

526
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,878
The Cardassians might
be able to detect it

527
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,255
even through the cloak.

528
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:54,714
A chance
we have to take.

529
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,674
Lay in the course
for Omekla III.

530
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:57,843
Engage at warp eight.

531
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,761
Warp eight.
Aye, sir.

532
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,305
Omekla III?

533
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:03,390
You're headed for the shipyard?

534
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,185
There have to be
half a dozen better targets

535
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,853
in this sector alone.

536
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,314
I hope the Cardassians
have the same reaction.

537
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:12,274
"What is he doing?

538
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:13,567
And why?"

539
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,402
All right, now you're trying

540
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:18,322
to keep them off balance,
keep them guessing.

541
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:20,698
Why?

542
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:24,744
The Maquis have
been hearing rumors

543
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,121
about shifting loyalties

544
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,081
in the Cardassian
government.

545
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,125
Certain hard-line elements
were unsatisfied

546
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,585
with the Federation treaty

547
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,795
and are doing whatever
they can to scrap it.

548
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,425
We got our hands
on an intelligence report

549
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:42,804
outlining suspected military
buildup in the Orias system--

550
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,641
a<i> secret</i> buildup that even the
Central Command isn't aware of.

551
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:49,019
You're telling me
you did all of this

552
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:52,648
to attack some secret base
that may or may not exist?

553
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:55,234
I'm convinced that it does.

554
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,403
They are building
an invasion fleet.

555
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:59,071
If we let them finish it,

556
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:02,324
these renegade Cardassians
are going to use it.

557
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,331
You're really not cut out
for this, are you?

558
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,333
Being a terrorist,
I mean.

559
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:15,588
You're not very good at it.

560
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:17,214
Really?

561
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,798
You're acting more like
a Starfleet officer

562
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:22,052
who's more interested
in intelligence reports

563
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:26,473
and Cardassian politics, than
in actually hurting Cardassians.

564
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,477
You have one
of the most powerful ships

565
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,730
in this Quadrant
under your command.

566
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,774
Why aren't you out attacking
every Cardassian outpost

567
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,067
along the border?

568
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:39,069
Because these stakes
are far greater

569
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,571
than border outposts.

570
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:42,364
Not for the Maquis,
they're not,

571
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,324
because the Maquis
are terrorists,

572
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,243
and the only thing
terrorists care about

573
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,161
is attacking the enemy.

574
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,705
I know--
I was a terrorist

575
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:52,374
and if I had
had this ship then,

576
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,543
I would have destroyed
Deep Space 9.

577
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,253
I would have hit
the Cardassians so hard,

578
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:57,921
they would have
screamed for peace.

579
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,299
But I certainly wouldn't
have gone flying off

580
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,175
into the middle
of Cardassia

581
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,511
on some
wild-goose chase.

582
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:07,180
I guess we're different
kinds of terrorists.

583
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,349
No...

584
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:12,352
you're trying
to be a hero.

585
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,896
Terrorists don't
get to be heroes.

586
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:19,485
We'll see.

587
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:22,362
SISKO:
This is how
your ships were deployed

588
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,822
before the first
<i>Defiant</i> attack.

589
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,658
And this is where
they are now.

590
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,453
Don't you see
what happened?

591
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:31,079
Each<i> Defiant</i> attack
was designed

592
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,457
to draw your ships
away from<i> that</i> sector,

593
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,793
leaving it virtually
defenseless.

594
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:38,796
But there's nothing
of any value<i> in</i> that sector.

595
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:40,297
There<i> must</i> be something.

596
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:42,424
Are there any M-Class
planets there?

597
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:44,259
Well, there's one--

598
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:48,722
Orias III,
but it's uninhabited.
It's desolate.

599
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:51,016
But everything seems to point
to the Orias system.

600
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:54,102
It might be worth your sending
one of your warships there,

601
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,438
just in case
the<i> Defiant</i> does show up.

602
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,941
All right.

603
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,568
Contact Gul Ranor.

604
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,613
Tell him to dispatch
one warship...

605
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:05,739
KORINAS:
No.

606
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,576
You'll send no ships
to the Orias system.

607
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,621
You're here as an observer.
You have no authority.

608
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:16,291
That sector is under direct
control of the Obsidian Order

609
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,710
and you will not enter it.

610
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,877
Why?!

611
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,796
That matter's classified.

612
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,464
Well.

613
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:27,135
You can file a complaint
with the Central Command later.

614
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,805
Open a channel
to Gul Ranor now.

615
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,931
<i>Any</i> warship sent
into the Orias system

616
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,809
will be destroyed.

617
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:36,520
Are you saying
that you will fire

618
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,772
on another Cardassian ship?

619
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,941
What I am saying is
that the Obsidian Order

620
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,695
will take whatever steps
are necessary

621
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:46,572
to protect the Orias system.

622
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:48,407
And so will I.

623
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:12,890
I've spoken to a few friends
in the Central Command.

624
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:15,392
The Obsidian Order isn't giving
them any answers, either.

625
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,853
The Order has
to answer to someone.

626
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,688
In theory, they answer

627
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,232
to the political authority
of the Detapa Council

628
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:24,067
just as the military does.

629
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,820
In practice, we both
run our own affairs.

630
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,447
Not a very
efficient system.

631
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:31,116
It's worked for
over five centuries.

632
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,034
CREWMAN:
There's an incoming message

633
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,579
from the Warship<i> Kraxon.</i>

634
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,831
They say they've found
an unusual neutrino signature

635
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:38,874
in their sector.

636
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,500
It looks
like radiation

637
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,128
from a damaged
warp plasma relay.

638
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,963
Is this signature moving?

639
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,466
No, but they're
scanning their area

640
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,551
with their antiproton beams.

641
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:50,677
Where is the<i> Kraxon?</i>

642
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:58,727
If it is the<i> Defiant,</i>
they're in position

643
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,938
to make a run
for the Orias system.

644
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:03,816
We still don't know
that Orias is the target.

645
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:05,776
Until we do, I can't risk

646
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:08,821
pulling ships away from
other potential targets

647
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:11,406
to chase down
a neutrino signature.

648
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,702
They're coming around
for another pass.

649
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,704
Are there any other ships
nearby?

650
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,373
There are nine
Galor-class cruisers

651
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,792
about six
light-years away.

652
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,710
Any ships between us
and the Orias system?

653
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,712
No.
If you make
a run for it,

654
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,547
that ship out there's
going to see

655
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,007
our neutrino signature
go through a phase change.

656
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,592
They're going to call
their nine friends

657
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,093
and you are going to have
a small fleet

658
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,637
chasing you
all the way to Orias.

659
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:36,974
They can chase me
all they want...

660
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:38,976
as long as they don't catch me.

661
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:40,686
The<i> Kraxon</i> reports

662
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:43,021
that the neutrino signature
has just phase-shifted

663
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,357
and is moving now
at warp speed

664
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,734
directly toward
the Orias system.

665
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,988
Order the<i> Kraxon</i>
to pursue at maximum warp.

666
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:53,782
Order all other ships
in the sector to follow.

667
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:55,701
The<i> Kraxon</i> is pursuing,

668
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:58,704
but they won't catch us
before we reach Orias.
Full scan.

669
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,914
I want to see everything
that's in that system.

670
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:05,585
When you make out your report
for the Obsidian Order,

671
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,045
be sure to mention
the fact

672
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,839
that I could
have prevented

673
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:10,089
the<i> Defiant</i>
from reaching Orias

674
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,383
if you hadn't interfered.

675
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,677
They will never reach Orias.

676
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,721
You can count on that.

677
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,764
CREWMAN:
Three more ships
have just appeared

678
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,057
in the Orias system.

679
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,893
DUKAT:
What kind of ships?

680
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:24,437
Cardassian warships...
Keldon-class.

681
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,190
Whose ships
are those, Korinas?

682
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,108
Why are you asking me?

683
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,444
Because if they
were military ships,

684
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,154
I would know about them.

685
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,741
So that leaves
the Obsidian Order.

686
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:38,410
I thought the Obsidian Order
didn't have any ships.

687
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,912
They're not supposed to.

688
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:42,121
In fact, they are
explicitly forbidden

689
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,874
from having
military equipment

690
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:45,751
of any kind.

691
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:54,927
TOM:
It looks like we're going to
have to fight our way to Orias.

692
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:56,386
Listen to me.

693
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,388
Those three ships
up ahead

694
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:01,058
are going to lock onto our
neutrino leak and open fire.

695
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:03,184
That means you're going
to have to fight back.

696
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,437
With this ship, it'll be a short
fight, I promise you that.

697
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,105
Let's say you disable

698
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,524
or even destroy, those
three ships up ahead of us.

699
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,651
Fighting them at all
is going to slow us down.

700
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,319
And then those ten ships
behind us

701
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,154
are going to catch up.

702
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,990
And not even the<i> Defiant</i>
can win against those odds.

703
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,784
We have come too far
to quit now.

704
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:21,453
You are an experienced
Starfleet officer, Tom.

705
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,038
Analyze the situation.

706
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,915
Going to Orias is suicide.

707
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:28,710
Now, the smart move is to make
a run for it while we still can.

708
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,921
Maybe that's what an experienced
Starfleet officer would do,

709
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,090
maybe that's what
<i>Will</i> Riker would do,

710
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,092
but it's not
what<i> I'm</i> going to do. 

711
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:37,052
I'm going to continue
the mission.

712
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:38,929
It's not the mission you're
thinking about, is it?

713
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:40,889
Or even the colonists
in the Zone.

714
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,307
This is about you, isn't it?

715
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,183
You and that other
Will Riker out there.

716
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,478
The man with your face,
your name, your career.

717
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:49,106
You are looking for a way
to set yourself apart.

718
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:50,690
Some way to be different.

719
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,943
You shouldn't go fishing today.

720
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:54,778
You won't catch anything.

721
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,864
Take us in.

722
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:10,418
You want to know
what's going on

723
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,211
in the Orias system,

724
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,589
I know how
you can find out.

725
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,967
Give Riker a chance
to surrender.

726
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:20,053
The<i> Defiant's</i> scanned
the Orias system by now.

727
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:22,139
Its sensor logs
can tell you

728
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:23,974
everything you
want to know.

729
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:26,726
I'd be happy to accept
his surrender,

730
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,228
but I doubt he'll be willing
to hand over his logs.

731
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,982
He will, if you agree
to release Major Kira,

732
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:34,985
turn the ship and the Maquis
over to the Federation.

733
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:36,569
Impossible!

734
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:39,114
I cannot allow a group
of terrorists

735
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:42,659
to just walk away
after invading our territory...

736
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:45,495
Then you must decide
which is important to you--

737
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,622
your sense of
Cardassian justice,

738
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:51,168
or the information contained
in the<i> Defiant's</i> sensor logs.

739
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:56,173
I<i> do</i> want that information,
Commander,

740
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:59,676
and I would be willing
to return your wayward ship,

741
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:02,179
but someone has to pay
for what's happened here,

742
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:04,639
and I don't want
that someone to be me.

743
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,017
If you return the Maquis
to the Federation,

744
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:09,352
I can promise you
that they will stand trial

745
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,436
for what they've done.

746
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,522
A Federation trial.

747
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:14,024
It's the best I can do.

748
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,735
All right.

749
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:20,864
I would be willing
to hand over

750
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:25,035
Major Kira, the Maquis
and the ship,

751
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:26,661
but not Riker.

752
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,997
He led the mission.

753
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:31,708
If I can bring
him to justice

754
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:35,294
and obtain the
information on Orias,

755
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:38,381
that might be enough
for Central Command.

756
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:53,730
I might be able
to get him to do it

757
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,481
on one condition.

758
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,943
We both know
that Cardassian sentences

759
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:01,154
are determined
well in advance of the trial.

760
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:04,282
I'd like you to arrange
a sentence other than death.

761
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,621
(<i> sighs</i> )

762
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,706
I'll have to clear that

763
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,792
with the Ministry
of Justice.

764
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,878
You'd better make it quick.

765
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:30,058
We're approaching
the first cruiser.

766
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:32,435
They'll be in phaser range
in 15 seconds.

767
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,314
Go to impulse.
De-cloak the ship.

768
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,358
Raise shields and
stand by phasers.

769
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:43,529
Go to heading 118
mark 310.

770
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,991
Lock on phasers.

771
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:47,533
Fire.

772
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:54,499
Direct hit on the cruiser's
port nacelle.

773
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:57,043
Their shields
are down by 30 percent.

774
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,129
TAMAL:
We've been hit on
our starboard shield.

775
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,138
TAMAL:
Shields holding.

776
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:10,223
Quantum torpedoes--
full spread.

777
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:11,599
Torpedoes locked
on target.

778
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,934
Fire!

779
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:19,482
Their defense systems
are off-line,

780
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,776
and they've lost
main power.

781
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:24,321
Tom, three more cruisers
have just appeared
in the Orias system.

782
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:26,114
That makes five ships
ahead of us and ten behind.

783
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,827
Resume our original course
to the Orias system.

784
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:33,038
Stand by emergency
power to the shields.

785
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:35,456
Incoming message
from Cardassia Prime.

786
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,501
It's Gul Dukat
and Commander Sisko.

787
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,547
On screen.

788
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:45,675
This is Gul Dukat
of the Second Order.

789
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:49,387
I am authorized to tell you
that if you surrender your ship,

790
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,472
none of you will be harmed.

791
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,849
Is that right?

792
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,561
Listen to him, Lieutenant.

793
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:59,231
If you surrender,
the<i> Defiant</i> and its crew

794
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:01,858
will be handed over
to a Federation starship

795
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,193
at the Cardassian border.

796
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:04,944
Why the sudden generosity?

797
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,405
He wants the<i> Defiant's</i>
sensor logs

798
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,990
on the Orias system.

799
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,617
They're worth a lot more
to him than Maquis prisoners.

800
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,370
I don't buy it.

801
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:16,455
The Cardassians aren't going
to just let us walk away.

802
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,623
You're right.

803
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:20,335
Someone has
to pay the price.

804
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:24,589
Me.
The deal is,

805
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:27,300
you'll be tried and convicted
in a Cardassian court

806
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,886
and then sentenced
to spend the rest of your life

807
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:32,847
in the Lazon II labor camp.

808
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,350
No death sentence, huh?

809
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,352
That must have taken some doing.

810
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:39,979
Some.

811
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,690
Give me a moment.

812
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,489
Tom.

813
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:56,621
There's no reason
for you to continue.

814
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,872
They're offering
you a way out.

815
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,332
The only reason
not to take it

816
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:00,499
is because you
want to die.

817
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,294
I have a mission to complete.

818
00:41:02,294 --> 00:41:03,669
That mission
is over.

819
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,671
You're never going
to make it to Orias.

820
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,215
You know that, Tom.

821
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,467
There are five ships
out there ahead of you,

822
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,429
but there may be 50 waiting
there, for all we know.

823
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:15,514
Be a Starfleet
officer one last time.

824
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,309
Think of your crew.

825
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:20,103
I know you want Tom Riker
to go out in a blaze of glory

826
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:22,439
that they talk about
for the next ten years.

827
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:25,483
Don't drag them along with you.

828
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:34,826
On screen.

829
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,290
I agree to your terms.

830
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,750
SISKO:
You need to reverse course

831
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,171
and surrender the<i> Defiant</i> 
to one of the ships
that's been following you.

832
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,965
Why?
It will take
too long to explain

833
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:51,843
but the ships coming out
of the Orias system

834
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,719
are not under
Gul Dukat's control.

835
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,638
RIKER:
I see.

836
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,016
I've ordered the<i> Kraxon</i> 
to put her shields
around you

837
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,351
as soon as you arrive.

838
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:01,602
You'll be safe
once you get there.

839
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,937
Understood.

840
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:09,610
Turn us about.

841
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,446
Lay in a course
for the<i> Kraxon.</i>

842
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,240
Do it.

843
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:24,459
DUKAT:
Those are faster than
any Keldon-class ships

844
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,503
I've ever seen.

845
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:30,131
What is going on
in that system?

846
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:32,550
We're 100 million kilometers
from the<i> Kraxon.</i>

847
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,551
TAMAL:
Incoming message.

848
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,969
Let's hear it.

849
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,846
This is Gul Ranor of the<i> Kraxon.</i>

850
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:38,973
Cut your engines
in five seconds,

851
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,184
and we will extend
our shields around you.

852
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:43,061
Acknowledged.

853
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,187
Kalita.

854
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,274
All stop.

855
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,050
DUKAT:
They won't fire

856
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,801
on another Cardassian ship.

857
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:18,430
They can't.

858
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,894
KALITA:
They're moving off.

859
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:27,522
They've set course
back to the Orias system.

860
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:28,731
TOM:
Transmit the Orias III

861
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,691
sensor logs to the<i> Kraxon,</i>

862
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,819
and tell them to prepare
to beam me aboard.

863
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:36,739
I'm turning command over
to Major Kira.

864
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:39,867
She'll get you back
to the Federation.

865
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,953
I'm holding you
personally responsible

866
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:44,122
to see that these people get
a fair trial.

867
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,416
I give you my word.

868
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:51,212
We'll get you
out of there, Tom.

869
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:52,880
I promise you that.

870
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:11,608
Riker to<i> Kraxon.</i>

871
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:12,942
GUL RANOR:
Go ahead.

872
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:14,569
One to beam up.

873
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:24,745
