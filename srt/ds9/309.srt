1
00:00:02,196 --> 00:00:03,927
Kira, we've got
six Byzatium transports

2
00:00:03,966 --> 00:00:05,093
coming in this afternoon.

3
00:00:05,135 --> 00:00:06,296
I've got to have
more cargo space.

4
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:09,004
All right, have them off-load

5
00:00:09,043 --> 00:00:10,774
into Cargo Bays 3 and 4,
but that's it.

6
00:00:10,813 --> 00:00:12,806
We are pushing
our storage capacity as it is.

7
00:00:12,851 --> 00:00:13,944
Well, that reminds me...

8
00:00:13,986 --> 00:00:15,649
we got a message last night
saying the Byzallians

9
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,523
want to move their
conference up by a week.

10
00:00:20,065 --> 00:00:23,401
I haven't had a chance to read
through last night's reports.

11
00:00:23,438 --> 00:00:25,465
Is there anything else
I should know?

12
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:26,670
Well, um...

13
00:00:28,181 --> 00:00:29,080
What?

14
00:00:30,586 --> 00:00:32,579
Starfleet wants
a complete report done

15
00:00:32,624 --> 00:00:34,685
on our computer
calibration subroutine.

16
00:00:34,728 --> 00:00:37,495
The whole subroutine?

17
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:38,523
When?

18
00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:40,232
Tomorrow.

19
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:51,252
Major, the scheduled transport's
been delayed

20
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:53,763
and I need those medical
supplies by the end of the week.

21
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:55,097
We can't spare a runabout

22
00:00:55,135 --> 00:00:57,105
to go all the way
to Vulcan right now.

23
00:00:57,139 --> 00:00:59,006
I'm supposed to be setting up
a field hospital

24
00:00:59,043 --> 00:01:00,706
for a new colony
on Campor III next week.

25
00:01:00,747 --> 00:01:02,410
And if I don't get
those medical supplies

26
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:03,940
then the entire
colonization schedule

27
00:01:03,986 --> 00:01:05,215
could be set back
by at least...

28
00:01:05,322 --> 00:01:06,722
Listen to me!

29
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:09,025
You can't have a runabout.

30
00:01:09,063 --> 00:01:10,828
You cannot get
your medical supplies

31
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:13,703
and I don't give a damn about
the colonization schedule!

32
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:15,139
Those colonists can make do

33
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,077
with a box of bandages
for all I care.

34
00:01:17,112 --> 00:01:18,239
Stop right there!

35
00:01:18,348 --> 00:01:19,373
Major.

36
00:01:27,065 --> 00:01:29,001
When was your last day off?

37
00:01:29,036 --> 00:01:30,004
I don't know.

38
00:01:30,038 --> 00:01:32,235
What does that have to do
with anything?

39
00:01:32,276 --> 00:01:35,305
If you can't remember,
then it's been too long.

40
00:01:36,652 --> 00:01:38,849
You're off duty,
as of this moment.

41
00:01:38,889 --> 00:01:42,055
What do you mean I'm off duty?

42
00:01:42,095 --> 00:01:44,031
You can't do that.

43
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:45,968
Oh, yes, I can,
and not even Commander Sisko

44
00:01:46,003 --> 00:01:48,473
can overrule my judgment
as Chief Medical Officer.

45
00:01:50,378 --> 00:01:53,782
Now... now, wait a minute,
Julian.

46
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:55,550
Just because I snapped...

47
00:01:55,589 --> 00:01:59,552
My diagnosis is
that you are overworked

48
00:01:59,597 --> 00:02:02,160
and suffering
from extreme stress

49
00:02:02,202 --> 00:02:04,263
and borderline exhaustion.

50
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,903
As for my prescription...

51
00:02:08,615 --> 00:02:09,844
Follow me.

52
00:02:20,138 --> 00:02:22,131
<i>Karvino</i> juice

53
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:24,407
Lorvan crackers

54
00:02:24,446 --> 00:02:26,473
a holosuite program

55
00:02:26,517 --> 00:02:29,318
a <i>jumja</i> stick
and gambling tokens.

56
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:31,019
Now, at least two of these items

57
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,157
must be used and fully enjoyed
before you leave this facility.

58
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,326
Julian, I...

59
00:02:35,402 --> 00:02:37,999
I'll be giving you a full report
of her activities, Doctor.

60
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,806
And if I hear you
didn't completely relax

61
00:02:39,844 --> 00:02:41,005
and enjoy yourself tonight

62
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:43,210
we'll do this every night
until you do.

63
00:02:44,486 --> 00:02:46,319
Have fun!

64
00:02:58,448 --> 00:03:02,718
Looks like you've got
your evening all planned.

65
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:05,388
Hope you've got room
for the unexpected.

66
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:07,811
Welcome aboard, Commander.

67
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,682
Thank you.

68
00:05:09,718 --> 00:05:11,347
Call me Will.

69
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:13,859
What brings you to Deep Space 9?

70
00:05:13,894 --> 00:05:15,260
Strictly pleasure.

71
00:05:15,296 --> 00:05:17,630
Actually, I have built up
about three months of leave

72
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:19,159
and Dr. Crusher finally insisted

73
00:05:19,204 --> 00:05:20,433
that I take some of it.

74
00:05:20,473 --> 00:05:21,999
She nearly shoved me
out of the airlock.

75
00:05:23,246 --> 00:05:25,739
Well, DS9 isn't exactly
known as a vacation spot.

76
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,620
Actually, I was just passing
through on my way to Risa.

77
00:05:28,656 --> 00:05:29,817
The last time I was here

78
00:05:29,859 --> 00:05:32,490
I was only able to spend
a couple of hours at Quark's.

79
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:34,933
But, by the time I left,
I had all of his latinum

80
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:36,734
and a date
with one of his dabo girls

81
00:05:36,772 --> 00:05:38,674
so I thought
I might try my luck again.

82
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,441
You be careful.

83
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,780
Quark's dabo wheel's been
a little stingy lately

84
00:05:42,818 --> 00:05:45,722
and one of his dabo girls
is dating my son.

85
00:05:45,757 --> 00:05:49,288
In that case, I think I'd better
spend my time in the holosuite.

86
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:51,392
It sounds safer,
all the way around.

87
00:05:58,449 --> 00:05:59,474
Who's in there?

88
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,579
What?

89
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:03,148
Who's in with Benjamin?

90
00:06:03,192 --> 00:06:07,462
Oh, it's Will... Commander
Will Riker from the <i>Enterprise.</i>

91
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:10,371
Will Riker?

92
00:06:10,406 --> 00:06:12,740
You know him?

93
00:06:12,778 --> 00:06:13,803
Yeah.

94
00:06:13,846 --> 00:06:16,043
I met him a year ago at Quark's.

95
00:06:16,118 --> 00:06:17,712
He's, uh, quite a dabo player.

96
00:06:17,754 --> 00:06:19,052
Hmm.

97
00:06:19,091 --> 00:06:21,027
Do you know him?

98
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:22,621
Yes, a little.

99
00:06:22,664 --> 00:06:26,570
I met him at Quark's last night.

100
00:06:26,605 --> 00:06:29,270
You met him last night, and?

101
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:30,711
And we talked.

102
00:06:32,317 --> 00:06:33,717
And then?

103
00:06:33,753 --> 00:06:36,782
And then we talked.

104
00:06:36,826 --> 00:06:39,423
For three hours.

105
00:06:39,464 --> 00:06:41,798
No, we just talked.

106
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:45,002
And, yes, he's a warm,
charming man...

107
00:06:45,043 --> 00:06:47,571
but I'm involved with someone.

108
00:06:47,614 --> 00:06:49,982
Of course.

109
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:56,563
So why do you keep glancing
back at Sisko's office?

110
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:58,090
If you can find the time

111
00:06:58,135 --> 00:07:00,469
you have an open invitation
for dinner with me and Jake.

112
00:07:00,506 --> 00:07:02,408
Thank you.
I may take you up on that.

113
00:07:02,444 --> 00:07:04,437
I hope you're not here
for another loan.

114
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:05,949
Don't tell me you've forgotten

115
00:07:05,985 --> 00:07:07,887
who staked you
three strips of latinum

116
00:07:07,921 --> 00:07:09,584
when your winning streak
ran dry.

117
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,424
I'm sorry.
Of course.

118
00:07:11,462 --> 00:07:12,760
Most of that night's
still a blur.

119
00:07:12,797 --> 00:07:13,992
How have you been, Dax?

120
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,002
Fine.

121
00:07:15,036 --> 00:07:16,265
Well, I'd better
get out of your way.

122
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:17,739
I know you all have work to do.

123
00:07:17,774 --> 00:07:19,265
Hope to see you again.

124
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:20,301
Major.

125
00:07:20,346 --> 00:07:21,940
Commander.

126
00:07:41,388 --> 00:07:42,583
- Oh!
- Oh!

127
00:07:42,624 --> 00:07:43,683
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:43,726 --> 00:07:45,024
That's all right.

129
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:46,361
My mind was a million
light-years away.

130
00:07:46,398 --> 00:07:48,368
I should have been paying
attention to where I was going.

131
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:49,893
You doing some shopping?

132
00:07:49,938 --> 00:07:51,840
Well, actually, I was just
exploring the Promenade.

133
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,845
I'd thought
about going into Quark's

134
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,849
but I wasn't really in the mood.

135
00:07:55,883 --> 00:07:56,851
Where are you off to?

136
00:07:56,885 --> 00:07:57,853
I'm just getting off duty.

137
00:07:57,887 --> 00:07:59,014
I was about to call it a night.

138
00:07:59,057 --> 00:08:00,993
Oh, I see.

139
00:08:01,028 --> 00:08:02,964
Well, good night.

140
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:05,664
Good night.

141
00:08:08,042 --> 00:08:09,032
Commander?

142
00:08:10,513 --> 00:08:12,608
Would you like a tour
of the station?

143
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:15,784
I'd love one.

144
00:08:15,823 --> 00:08:17,349
Where should we begin?

145
00:08:17,394 --> 00:08:19,591
We can walk along the Promenade
for a start.

146
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:21,260
There's quite a bit to see here.

147
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:22,326
You think we might get a chance

148
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,668
to look at that new starship
of yours?

149
00:08:23,706 --> 00:08:24,674
What do you call it, the...

150
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:25,801
Oh, the <i>Defiant.</i>

151
00:08:25,843 --> 00:08:26,811
Yes, the <i>Defiant.</i>

152
00:08:26,845 --> 00:08:28,576
I understand
it's quite a vessel.

153
00:08:28,616 --> 00:08:30,245
I'm sure that can be arranged.

154
00:08:41,642 --> 00:08:45,207
Please identify
for access to USS <i>Defiant.</i>

155
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,947
Major Kira Nerys,
Bajoran militia.

156
00:08:47,987 --> 00:08:49,513
Identity confirmed.

157
00:08:51,328 --> 00:08:53,560
Commander William Riker,
Starfleet.

158
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,466
Identity confirmed.

159
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,662
Chief, I didn't know anyone else
was on board tonight.

160
00:09:12,704 --> 00:09:13,694
Oh, I hadn't planned to.

161
00:09:13,739 --> 00:09:15,368
Ouch!

162
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:17,709
I was just getting
a little extra work done

163
00:09:17,747 --> 00:09:20,217
on the deflector
targeting arrays.

164
00:09:20,253 --> 00:09:24,216
Commander...
I'd heard you were aboard

165
00:09:24,294 --> 00:09:25,421
but I-I hadn't...

166
00:09:25,463 --> 00:09:27,228
There's nothing to say
to you, O'Brien.

167
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,358
I think you know why.

168
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,737
Well, maybe we should
come back another time.

169
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,976
No, no, no, Major,
it's all right.

170
00:09:36,017 --> 00:09:38,078
I was just leaving.

171
00:09:39,324 --> 00:09:41,419
Commander.

172
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:46,796
What was all that about?

173
00:09:46,838 --> 00:09:47,931
Ah, it's a long story.

174
00:09:47,974 --> 00:09:49,603
I'd rather not get into it.

175
00:09:49,644 --> 00:09:52,172
Let's take a look
at this ship of yours.

176
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:55,280
Okay. I'll, uh, show you
the tactical systems first.

177
00:09:55,323 --> 00:09:56,952
Think you're going
to be surprised

178
00:09:56,992 --> 00:09:58,985
at how big a punch
this little ship has.

179
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,573
Running the plasma conduit

180
00:10:08,616 --> 00:10:10,107
through your primary
phaser coupling

181
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:11,712
has almost doubled
your phaser power.

182
00:10:11,755 --> 00:10:13,850
Doesn't that cut into
your warp drive efficiency?

183
00:10:13,892 --> 00:10:18,333
Not at all, in fact,
it's 30% more efficient.

184
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:19,769
That's ingenious.

185
00:10:19,804 --> 00:10:21,330
I'd like to see
how it's all routed

186
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:23,308
through the tactical display.

187
00:10:24,714 --> 00:10:27,948
Command authorization required.

188
00:10:27,987 --> 00:10:30,048
New security procedure.

189
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:32,927
Computer,
release Bridge lockout.

190
00:10:32,964 --> 00:10:36,904
Authorization:
Kira Delta-5-4-7-Alpha.

191
00:10:41,348 --> 00:10:42,373
Thank you.

192
00:10:42,483 --> 00:10:43,473
Ah!

193
00:11:01,655 --> 00:11:02,623
What's going on?

194
00:11:02,657 --> 00:11:04,684
I'm not sure,
but something happened

195
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:06,026
to the warp core on the <i>Defiant.</i>

196
00:11:06,063 --> 00:11:08,090
It looks like it's going
to breach in 57 seconds.

197
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,193
Anyone on board?

198
00:11:09,237 --> 00:11:11,070
O'Brien was working
there this morning

199
00:11:11,107 --> 00:11:12,336
but I don't know if he...

200
00:11:12,377 --> 00:11:13,971
Incoming signal
from the <i>Defiant.</i>

201
00:11:14,012 --> 00:11:15,037
It's Commander Riker.

202
00:11:15,081 --> 00:11:16,379
On screen.

203
00:11:16,418 --> 00:11:18,388
Commander Sisko,
there's been an accident.

204
00:11:18,422 --> 00:11:20,016
One of the plasma conduits
has exploded.

205
00:11:20,058 --> 00:11:21,891
Major Kira has been injured.

206
00:11:21,928 --> 00:11:24,330
We are 45 seconds
from a core breach.

207
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:26,166
Release the docking clamps.

208
00:11:26,204 --> 00:11:28,401
I will get us away
from the station.

209
00:11:28,442 --> 00:11:31,073
We'll beam the two of you out of
there as soon as you're clear.

210
00:11:31,113 --> 00:11:32,639
Docking clamps released.

211
00:11:32,683 --> 00:11:34,585
I'm engaging thrusters.

212
00:11:47,246 --> 00:11:48,305
15 seconds.

213
00:11:48,348 --> 00:11:50,079
Lock on and beam them away,
Chief.

214
00:11:50,118 --> 00:11:51,849
I can't get a lock.

215
00:11:51,888 --> 00:11:53,448
The <i>Defiant's</i> shields are up.

216
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:54,618
What?

217
00:12:01,675 --> 00:12:03,736
She's gone into warp.
I've lost them.

218
00:12:08,789 --> 00:12:11,693
We're beyond their sensor range.

219
00:12:11,728 --> 00:12:13,425
Lay in a course
for the Badlands, warp seven.

220
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:15,128
Tamal, secure that conduit.

221
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,534
Right.

222
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:17,869
Course laid in.

223
00:12:17,907 --> 00:12:20,400
We'll be in the Badlands
in six hours.

224
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:33,971
You did it, Tom.

225
00:12:34,006 --> 00:12:36,169
It's not over yet.

226
00:12:44,945 --> 00:12:47,644
Nine years ago
a transporter accident

227
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,654
created two William T. Rikers.

228
00:12:49,688 --> 00:12:51,988
One of them returned to his ship

229
00:12:52,025 --> 00:12:54,154
the other was marooned
on Nervala IV.

230
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:58,304
The second Riker was finally
discovered two years ago.

231
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:00,867
He chose to use
his middle name, Thomas

232
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,903
to distinguish himself
from the other Riker.

233
00:13:02,947 --> 00:13:06,113
The two men are physically
identical in all respects

234
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:08,750
right down to their DNA coding.

235
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:10,659
There was no way
for the security computer

236
00:13:10,696 --> 00:13:13,668
to know that it was
Thomas, not William

237
00:13:13,702 --> 00:13:15,604
who boarded the <i>Defiant.</i>

238
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,669
This is
a very entertaining story

239
00:13:18,712 --> 00:13:21,548
but... why am I listening to it?

240
00:13:24,824 --> 00:13:26,657
We have reason to believe

241
00:13:26,695 --> 00:13:30,099
that Thomas Riker
is a member of the Maquis.

242
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:34,669
What?

243
00:13:34,711 --> 00:13:38,515
Thomas Riker was serving
aboard the Starship <i>Gandhi.</i>

244
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:41,080
While he was there,
he began to express

245
00:13:41,123 --> 00:13:42,922
certain political opinions.

246
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,196
Opinions that supported
the Maquis and their goals.

247
00:13:47,235 --> 00:13:50,730
Are you telling me...

248
00:13:50,776 --> 00:13:57,278
that one of the most heavily
armed warships in this Quadrant

249
00:13:57,322 --> 00:14:00,955
is now in the hands
of Maquis terrorists?

250
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:14,517
Do you have any idea
what kind of response

251
00:14:14,557 --> 00:14:17,893
this will provoke
from the Central Command?

252
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,127
They'll probably want
to send ships

253
00:14:20,168 --> 00:14:23,197
into the Demilitarized Zone
to conduct a search.

254
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:24,436
We understand that

255
00:14:24,477 --> 00:14:27,745
but any entry into the Zone
must be a joint operation

256
00:14:27,817 --> 00:14:30,755
between Cardassia
and the Federation.

257
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:34,525
The Central Command
will not be interested

258
00:14:34,564 --> 00:14:37,730
in any joint operation,
Commander.

259
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,569
They won't believe your story

260
00:14:39,607 --> 00:14:47,317
about transporter duplicates
and security failures.

261
00:14:47,355 --> 00:14:49,791
They will assume that Starfleet

262
00:14:49,894 --> 00:14:53,355
wanted the Maquis
to have the <i>Defiant</i>

263
00:14:53,402 --> 00:14:57,035
and they will respond
accordingly.

264
00:14:57,075 --> 00:14:59,170
And what does that mean exactly?

265
00:14:59,213 --> 00:15:03,085
It means they will seize
this opportunity

266
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,149
to finally eliminate the Maquis.

267
00:15:06,193 --> 00:15:09,654
They will send a fleet
into that Zone.

268
00:15:12,138 --> 00:15:16,010
Starfleet will cooperate
in a search for the <i>Defiant</i>

269
00:15:16,046 --> 00:15:19,212
but they will not allow
the Central Command

270
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:23,091
to use this as an excuse
for a full-scale invasion.

271
00:15:23,127 --> 00:15:25,290
Of course not.

272
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:27,996
So you will send your
own fleet into the Zone

273
00:15:28,037 --> 00:15:30,634
to protect Federation colonies.

274
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:33,807
But, at some point,
the two fleets will meet

275
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:37,720
tensions will rise,
nerves will fray

276
00:15:37,757 --> 00:15:41,720
and someone will make
the tiniest mistake.

277
00:15:41,765 --> 00:15:44,328
And we'll have a war
on our hands.

278
00:15:44,369 --> 00:15:47,773
It is a prospect
I do not relish, Commander.

279
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,210
Neither do we.

280
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:52,815
That's why we need
to work together

281
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:54,686
to prevent it from happening.

282
00:15:54,724 --> 00:15:56,090
Well, unless I can bring

283
00:15:56,126 --> 00:16:00,123
something back to Central
Command to prove your good faith

284
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:03,231
and your willingness
to help stop the <i>Defiant</i>

285
00:16:03,274 --> 00:16:04,937
I don't believe anything

286
00:16:04,978 --> 00:16:08,645
can prevent this conflict
from beginning.

287
00:16:08,685 --> 00:16:10,484
Then bring me with you.

288
00:16:10,522 --> 00:16:13,015
I can help you stop the <i>Defiant</i>

289
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,053
and prove our good faith.

290
00:16:15,098 --> 00:16:18,833
I was in charge of the shipyard
where the <i>Defiant</i> was built.

291
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:21,502
I helped design it.

292
00:16:21,544 --> 00:16:25,245
I know her vulnerabilities
and her weaknesses.

293
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:28,849
You'll help us destroy
one of your own ships?

294
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,624
I want to try
and disable it first.

295
00:16:31,664 --> 00:16:34,465
Oh, I'm sure you do.

296
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:42,885
But you are in no position
to bargain here, Commander.

297
00:16:42,987 --> 00:16:45,550
You want to prevent a war

298
00:16:45,592 --> 00:16:50,762
you come back to Cardassia
with me, and you help me

299
00:16:50,803 --> 00:16:54,573
destroy the <i>Defiant.</i>

300
00:17:03,294 --> 00:17:08,168
I don't care who you are
or what your name is.

301
00:17:08,204 --> 00:17:12,042
I am sorry about lying to you,
and I'm sorry about using you.

302
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:13,512
It was an operational necessity!

303
00:17:13,548 --> 00:17:15,518
You were a resistance fighter.

304
00:17:15,552 --> 00:17:16,747
You know that certain times

305
00:17:16,788 --> 00:17:18,519
you do things
that you're not proud of

306
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:19,890
to accomplish the mission.

307
00:17:19,961 --> 00:17:23,365
Well, you accomplished
your mission, so now what?

308
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,029
Everyone's going
to be looking for you.

309
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:26,369
The Cardassians and Starfleet.

310
00:17:26,406 --> 00:17:28,569
How far do you think you're
going to get with this ship

311
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:29,807
before they find you?

312
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:32,317
A lot farther
than people anticipate.

313
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:33,547
Kalita to Riker.

314
00:17:33,588 --> 00:17:34,920
We've reached
the rendezvous point.

315
00:17:34,957 --> 00:17:37,359
I'm on my way.

316
00:17:43,942 --> 00:17:46,344
The other Maquis ships
just arrived.

317
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,746
The rest of the team's ready.

318
00:17:47,783 --> 00:17:49,616
Lower the shields
and beam them aboard.

319
00:17:52,325 --> 00:17:55,456
The Maquis ships
are heading for the border, Tom.

320
00:17:55,498 --> 00:17:57,832
All defense systems on line
and operational.

321
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,031
Warp power standing by.

322
00:18:00,676 --> 00:18:04,137
Lay in a course for the
Cardassian border, warp eight.

323
00:18:04,182 --> 00:18:06,516
Course already laid in.

324
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:08,853
This ship was built to fight.

325
00:18:08,892 --> 00:18:11,762
I think it's time
she got her chance.

326
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:13,324
Engage.

327
00:18:18,077 --> 00:18:21,345
Commander's Log,
Stardate 48467.3.

328
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:23,946
Gul Dukat and I have arrived
on Cardassia Prime.

329
00:18:24,022 --> 00:18:26,550
I'm about to do something
which goes against 20 years

330
00:18:26,593 --> 00:18:28,222
of Starfleet training...

331
00:18:28,264 --> 00:18:31,395
help an enemy hunt down
one of our own ships.

332
00:18:31,436 --> 00:18:35,069
This is where I'll be conducting
the search for the <i>Defiant.</i>

333
00:18:35,111 --> 00:18:41,887
From this room, I can control
every Cardassian ship, outpost

334
00:18:41,924 --> 00:18:44,258
and space station
anywhere in our...

335
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:52,471
Ah, Commander, allow me
to introduce Korinas

336
00:18:52,512 --> 00:18:55,484
our observer
from the Obsidian Order.

337
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:56,816
Commander Sisko.

338
00:18:56,854 --> 00:18:58,015
Korinas.

339
00:18:58,057 --> 00:19:00,824
Welcome to Cardassia Prime,
Commander.

340
00:19:00,862 --> 00:19:01,955
Thank you.

341
00:19:01,998 --> 00:19:04,332
Excuse me.

342
00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:07,705
Secure that console
while the human is here.

343
00:19:07,743 --> 00:19:11,079
Anything else classified
level 4 or above

344
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:12,949
should also be secured.

345
00:19:15,358 --> 00:19:16,812
I'm sure you can understand

346
00:19:16,946 --> 00:19:19,416
that although we all respect
Gul Dukat's decision

347
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:22,651
to bring you here,
we must take some precautions.

348
00:19:22,725 --> 00:19:24,592
Of course.

349
00:19:24,628 --> 00:19:26,028
I would have done the same.

350
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,327
But then...

351
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:29,860
I would have been more discreet.

352
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,475
Since you are here

353
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:36,075
to provide technical expertise
on the <i>Defiant</i>

354
00:19:36,118 --> 00:19:38,384
I suggest you begin
by briefing us

355
00:19:38,422 --> 00:19:41,019
on the ship's
defensive capabilities.

356
00:19:41,061 --> 00:19:44,899
Please, describe for us
in detail

357
00:19:44,936 --> 00:19:47,031
the weapons systems
of the <i>Defiant</i>

358
00:19:47,073 --> 00:19:49,168
beginning with
the ship's phaser array...

359
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:52,307
Before we discuss weaponry,
there's a more urgent matter

360
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,479
that I think
you should be aware of.

361
00:19:54,521 --> 00:19:56,855
The <i>Defiant</i> is equipped
with a cloaking device.

362
00:19:58,195 --> 00:19:59,721
I wondered
if you were going to share

363
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,701
that little detail with us.

364
00:20:01,736 --> 00:20:02,931
You knew about this?

365
00:20:02,972 --> 00:20:05,603
The Obsidian Order
has known for some time

366
00:20:05,643 --> 00:20:07,476
about the loan
of a cloaking device

367
00:20:07,513 --> 00:20:09,107
from the Romulans
to the Federation.

368
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,554
And the Order chose not
to share this intelligence

369
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,287
with the Central Command?

370
00:20:14,327 --> 00:20:17,629
Until now, the Order had
not considered this one cloak

371
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,694
to be a threat
against Cardassia.

372
00:20:21,308 --> 00:20:23,335
Under our terms of agreement
with the Romulans

373
00:20:23,379 --> 00:20:25,042
the cloaking device
was to be used

374
00:20:25,082 --> 00:20:27,952
only in the Gamma Quadrant,
and then only in exchange

375
00:20:27,988 --> 00:20:30,653
for all our intelligence
reports on the Dominion.

376
00:20:30,693 --> 00:20:33,324
Well, your Lieutenant
Riker isn't likely

377
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:36,201
to respect that agreement
with the Romulans

378
00:20:36,238 --> 00:20:39,939
and there's no way
to locate a ship under cloak.

379
00:20:39,979 --> 00:20:41,676
There is one possibility.

380
00:20:41,715 --> 00:20:44,778
The Dominion managed
to penetrate the cloak

381
00:20:44,822 --> 00:20:47,589
by using some kind
of antiproton beam.

382
00:20:47,627 --> 00:20:50,394
Can you give us the
specifications of that beam?

383
00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:52,369
Not precisely,
but I can give you

384
00:20:52,403 --> 00:20:54,839
everything we've learned
from our sensor logs.

385
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,277
It'll give you a chance
to find the <i>Defiant</i>

386
00:20:57,313 --> 00:20:59,044
before she attacks.

387
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:04,955
We're approaching
the security perimeter, Tom.

388
00:21:04,995 --> 00:21:07,295
All right, this is it.

389
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,633
Red Alert.

390
00:21:09,671 --> 00:21:11,265
Cloak the ship.

391
00:21:11,308 --> 00:21:12,971
Stand by, weapons.

392
00:21:25,236 --> 00:21:27,764
Squadron Baker has arrived
at their checkpoint.

393
00:21:27,808 --> 00:21:29,368
Transmit the go-ahead signal.

394
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:33,680
We'll be in Cardassian
sensor range in five minutes.

395
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:37,454
There is a perimeter alert
in the Almatha sector.

396
00:21:37,493 --> 00:21:39,520
Put it on the main viewer.

397
00:21:46,778 --> 00:21:49,477
Who's commanding the outpost
nearest that ship?

398
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,544
Gul Toran of the Sixth Order.

399
00:21:51,588 --> 00:21:53,056
And he's identified the vessel.

400
00:21:53,091 --> 00:21:54,059
It's the <i>Defiant.</i>

401
00:21:54,093 --> 00:21:56,359
Order all warships

402
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:59,165
in that sector to converge
on the <i>Defiant.</i>

403
00:22:00,506 --> 00:22:02,169
Something's wrong.

404
00:22:03,345 --> 00:22:05,976
Why wouldn't they be cloaked?

405
00:22:06,017 --> 00:22:08,887
Can you show me the sensor
information on the <i>Defiant?</i>

406
00:22:12,797 --> 00:22:14,494
The <i>Defiant</i> is
attacking Outpost 61.

407
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:16,470
Tell Gul Toran

408
00:22:16,504 --> 00:22:18,770
that he has permission
to pursue the <i>Defiant</i>

409
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:20,300
into the Demilitarized Zone.

410
00:22:20,346 --> 00:22:23,250
No, don't pull your ships
off the border.

411
00:22:23,285 --> 00:22:25,118
Commander, you don't expect me

412
00:22:25,155 --> 00:22:27,250
to break off pursuit
of the <i>Defiant</i>

413
00:22:27,293 --> 00:22:29,126
simply because the treaty's...

414
00:22:29,163 --> 00:22:31,292
That's not the <i>Defiant.</i>
It's a decoy.

415
00:22:31,334 --> 00:22:33,827
They're trying to draw your
patrol ships out of position.

416
00:22:33,873 --> 00:22:36,309
That ship's sending
out a fake warp signature

417
00:22:36,344 --> 00:22:38,109
identical to the <i>Defiant's</i>

418
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:41,143
but the phase variance and
subspace harmonics don't match.

419
00:22:42,223 --> 00:22:44,318
Order Toran
to break off pursuit.

420
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,330
Have him redeploy...

421
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:48,266
Sir, another perimeter alert.

422
00:22:48,302 --> 00:22:49,896
Outpost 47 has detected

423
00:22:49,938 --> 00:22:52,101
a cloaked ship
with their antiproton beam.

424
00:22:53,512 --> 00:22:56,313
Tell Toran to head
for Outpost 47.

425
00:22:56,351 --> 00:22:58,321
The <i>Defiant</i> has de-cloaked

426
00:22:58,355 --> 00:23:00,484
and has begun
to attack the outpost.

427
00:23:01,896 --> 00:23:03,763
We've lost contact
with Outpost 47.

428
00:23:07,106 --> 00:23:08,837
Incoming message from Gul Toran.

429
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:10,207
The <i>Defiant</i> has re-cloaked

430
00:23:10,245 --> 00:23:14,778
and its last known heading
was 148 mark 215.

431
00:23:16,858 --> 00:23:21,527
It's headed directly into the
heart of Cardassian territory.

432
00:23:23,271 --> 00:23:26,368
Commander Sisko,
you should be commended.

433
00:23:26,411 --> 00:23:29,679
I only wish we had someone with
such keen tactical instincts

434
00:23:29,717 --> 00:23:34,489
who could have prevented
this invasion of our territory.

435
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,313
We're past
the security perimeter

436
00:23:46,351 --> 00:23:47,980
out of their sensor range.

437
00:23:48,021 --> 00:23:50,993
They're using antiproton beams
to scan for us.

438
00:23:51,027 --> 00:23:52,656
Adjust the cloak's
resonance frequency

439
00:23:52,696 --> 00:23:53,857
so they can't detect us again.

440
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:55,094
- Right.
- Damage report.

441
00:23:55,135 --> 00:23:56,764
We took six hits
on the port shields.

442
00:23:56,805 --> 00:23:58,137
There's been some minor damage

443
00:23:58,175 --> 00:24:00,509
to the outer hull,
but all systems are operational.

444
00:24:00,546 --> 00:24:02,106
Tough little ship.

445
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,880
Set a course for the shipyard
at Omekla III.

446
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,114
We'll let that be the place
that...

447
00:24:06,157 --> 00:24:07,216
Report.

448
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:09,958
We've lost main power,
and the cloak is off-line.

449
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,502
Looks like two plasma
conduits blew out.

450
00:24:12,536 --> 00:24:13,526
Where?

451
00:24:13,572 --> 00:24:16,772
Deck 3, section 15.

452
00:24:16,811 --> 00:24:17,904
Crew quarters.

453
00:24:20,853 --> 00:24:23,346
Looks like
Major Kira's been busy.

454
00:24:29,337 --> 00:24:31,432
You crossed the replicator
power converter

455
00:24:31,474 --> 00:24:32,669
with the plasma manifold,
I take it.

456
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:33,769
That's right.

457
00:24:33,812 --> 00:24:34,905
Nice work.

458
00:24:34,947 --> 00:24:37,179
You know I'll have that thing
bypassed in 30 minutes.

459
00:24:37,219 --> 00:24:39,348
At least that'll be 30 minutes
that we're visible.

460
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,656
Fortunately, I was able
to take us into a nebula.

461
00:24:41,694 --> 00:24:42,957
No one's going to see us.

462
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,668
Thanks.

463
00:24:46,504 --> 00:24:48,337
You're lucky
you only got singed.

464
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:50,311
You know, the whole plasma relay
could have exploded.

465
00:24:50,345 --> 00:24:51,745
Yeah, that was the idea.

466
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:54,844
You've been fighting Cardassians
most of your life.

467
00:24:54,887 --> 00:24:57,187
I know that you sympathize
with what we're doing here.

468
00:24:57,226 --> 00:24:59,857
I fought the Cardassians
because they invaded my home.

469
00:24:59,897 --> 00:25:01,867
You don't live
in the Demilitarized Zone.

470
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:03,267
You don't have family there.

471
00:25:03,305 --> 00:25:04,603
Why are you in this fight?

472
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,476
Because people are dying
in the Demilitarized Zone

473
00:25:07,513 --> 00:25:09,642
and Starfleet isn't doing
anything about it.

474
00:25:09,684 --> 00:25:11,654
Taking the <i>Defiant</i>
only raises the stakes.

475
00:25:11,688 --> 00:25:14,158
The Cardassians are going
to send a fleet after you.

476
00:25:14,193 --> 00:25:16,629
They are going to kill
more people hunting you down

477
00:25:16,664 --> 00:25:18,793
than they ever did
during those border raids.

478
00:25:18,835 --> 00:25:20,771
You're assuming
the <i>Defiant</i> is going to stay

479
00:25:20,806 --> 00:25:21,967
in the Demilitarized Zone.

480
00:25:22,008 --> 00:25:23,671
Let's go to the Bridge.

481
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,614
I think we'd all feel better
having you someplace

482
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,708
we can keep an eye on you.

483
00:25:28,054 --> 00:25:30,992
15 outposts have checked in.

484
00:25:31,026 --> 00:25:33,691
No sign of the <i>Defiant.</i>

485
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,066
26 warships have scanned

486
00:25:36,137 --> 00:25:39,838
14 cubic light-years of space
with antiproton beams...

487
00:25:39,877 --> 00:25:42,313
no <i>Defiant!</i>

488
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:43,749
What are the possibilities?

489
00:25:43,785 --> 00:25:45,083
They're still under cloak

490
00:25:45,155 --> 00:25:47,284
and heading deeper
into Cardassian space.

491
00:25:47,326 --> 00:25:48,521
They're laying low

492
00:25:48,561 --> 00:25:52,194
and waiting
for some unknown reason.

493
00:25:52,236 --> 00:25:53,204
Dukat.

494
00:25:53,238 --> 00:25:54,206
Hmm?

495
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,538
Are you listening to me?

496
00:25:55,575 --> 00:25:57,568
Oh, I'm sorry, Commander.

497
00:25:57,613 --> 00:26:00,744
I was thinking
about my son's birthday.

498
00:26:03,057 --> 00:26:04,525
Really?

499
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,584
Yes, today is his 11th birthday.

500
00:26:07,717 --> 00:26:08,514
Oh.

501
00:26:08,586 --> 00:26:10,283
I'd promised to take him

502
00:26:10,323 --> 00:26:14,195
to the amusement center
in Lakarian City.

503
00:26:14,231 --> 00:26:17,067
He always wanted to go...

504
00:26:18,071 --> 00:26:20,303
but I never had the time.

505
00:26:21,612 --> 00:26:27,750
I told him, "This year
will be different, Mekor.

506
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:31,925
This year,
I will make the time."

507
00:26:37,343 --> 00:26:40,440
I had the same experience
with Jake.

508
00:26:40,483 --> 00:26:44,583
At that age, they never
understand, do they?

509
00:26:44,624 --> 00:26:47,824
You just hope that,
one day later

510
00:26:47,864 --> 00:26:49,093
they'll look back and say

511
00:26:50,236 --> 00:26:52,604
"Now I understand.

512
00:26:52,674 --> 00:26:55,373
Now I know why he did that."

513
00:26:57,417 --> 00:27:02,325
When my son looks back
on this day

514
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,728
the only thing he'll remember

515
00:27:04,765 --> 00:27:09,001
is that a Federation officer,
on a Federation ship

516
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,011
invaded his home

517
00:27:12,045 --> 00:27:17,545
and kept his father away
from him on his 11th birthday

518
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:20,824
and he won't look back
with understanding.

519
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:25,094
He'll look back with hatred...

520
00:27:27,075 --> 00:27:29,238
and that's sad.

521
00:27:43,007 --> 00:27:45,273
The cloak is operating
within normal parameters

522
00:27:45,313 --> 00:27:46,873
but the plasma conduit damage

523
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,887
has caused a slight neutrino
leak in the port nacelle.

524
00:27:49,921 --> 00:27:52,323
The Cardassians might
be able to detect it

525
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,623
even through the cloak.

526
00:27:53,662 --> 00:27:54,994
A chance we have to take.

527
00:27:55,031 --> 00:27:56,933
Lay in the course
for Omekla III.

528
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:58,164
Engage at warp eight.

529
00:27:58,205 --> 00:28:00,038
Warp eight.
Aye, sir.

530
00:28:00,075 --> 00:28:01,065
Omekla III?

531
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,843
You're headed for the shipyard?

532
00:28:04,985 --> 00:28:06,511
There have to be
half a dozen better targets

533
00:28:06,555 --> 00:28:08,081
in this sector alone.

534
00:28:08,124 --> 00:28:10,617
I hope the Cardassians
have the same reaction.

535
00:28:10,663 --> 00:28:12,599
"What is he doing?

536
00:28:12,634 --> 00:28:13,863
And why?"

537
00:28:13,903 --> 00:28:15,770
All right, now you're trying

538
00:28:15,806 --> 00:28:18,607
to keep them off balance,
keep them guessing.

539
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,105
Why?

540
00:28:22,453 --> 00:28:24,946
The Maquis
have been hearing rumors

541
00:28:24,991 --> 00:28:28,259
about shifting loyalties
in the Cardassian government.

542
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:30,462
Certain hard-line elements
were unsatisfied

543
00:28:30,503 --> 00:28:31,869
with the Federation treaty

544
00:28:31,905 --> 00:28:34,205
and are doing whatever
they can to scrap it.

545
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:38,617
We got our hands
on an intelligence report

546
00:28:38,652 --> 00:28:42,922
outlining suspected military
buildup in the Orias system...

547
00:28:42,961 --> 00:28:46,024
a secret buildup that even the
Central Command isn't aware of.

548
00:28:46,067 --> 00:28:49,301
You're telling me
you did all of this

549
00:28:49,341 --> 00:28:52,974
to attack some secret base
that may or may not exist?

550
00:28:53,014 --> 00:28:55,484
I'm convinced that it does.

551
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:57,716
They are building
an invasion fleet.

552
00:28:57,757 --> 00:28:59,351
If we let them finish it

553
00:28:59,394 --> 00:29:02,855
these renegade Cardassians
are going to use it.

554
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:09,642
You're really not cut out
for this, are you?

555
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,810
Being a terrorist, I mean.

556
00:29:14,023 --> 00:29:15,822
You're not very good at it.

557
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,953
Really?

558
00:29:16,995 --> 00:29:19,090
You're acting more like
a Starfleet officer

559
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:22,264
who's more interested
in intelligence reports

560
00:29:22,306 --> 00:29:26,941
and Cardassian politics, than
in actually hurting Cardassians.

561
00:29:28,452 --> 00:29:30,718
You have one
of the most powerful ships

562
00:29:30,823 --> 00:29:33,020
in this Quadrant
under your command.

563
00:29:33,061 --> 00:29:36,192
Why aren't you out attacking
every Cardassian outpost

564
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:37,258
along the border?

565
00:29:37,303 --> 00:29:39,432
Because these stakes
are far greater

566
00:29:39,474 --> 00:29:40,965
than border outposts.

567
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,570
Not for the Maquis, they're not

568
00:29:42,613 --> 00:29:44,742
because the Maquis
are terrorists

569
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,617
and the only thing
terrorists care about

570
00:29:46,655 --> 00:29:48,420
is attacking the enemy.

571
00:29:48,459 --> 00:29:49,757
I know...
I was a terrorist

572
00:29:49,794 --> 00:29:52,766
and if I had had this ship then

573
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:54,667
I would have destroyed
Deep Space 9.

574
00:29:54,704 --> 00:29:56,697
I would have hit
the Cardassians so hard

575
00:29:56,741 --> 00:29:57,970
they would have
screamed for peace.

576
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:00,743
But I certainly wouldn't
have gone flying off

577
00:30:00,783 --> 00:30:04,689
into the middle of Cardassia
on some wild-goose chase.

578
00:30:04,724 --> 00:30:07,560
I guess we're different
kinds of terrorists.

579
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,624
No...

580
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:11,660
you're trying to be a hero.

581
00:30:12,673 --> 00:30:15,338
Terrorists don't get
to be heroes.

582
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,675
We'll see.

583
00:30:19,754 --> 00:30:22,317
This is how
your ships were deployed

584
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,387
before the first <i>Defiant</i> attack.

585
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,423
And this is where they are now.

586
00:30:28,672 --> 00:30:30,106
Don't you see what happened?

587
00:30:30,141 --> 00:30:31,804
Each <i>Defiant</i> attack
was designed

588
00:30:31,845 --> 00:30:34,111
to draw your ships
away from that sector

589
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:36,483
leaving it virtually
defenseless.

590
00:30:36,521 --> 00:30:39,357
But there's nothing
of any value in that sector.

591
00:30:39,394 --> 00:30:41,057
There must be something.

592
00:30:41,096 --> 00:30:43,589
Are there any M-Class
planets there?

593
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:45,035
Well, there's one...

594
00:30:45,071 --> 00:30:47,770
Orias III, but it's uninhabited.

595
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:48,869
It's desolate.

596
00:30:48,946 --> 00:30:51,782
But everything seems to point
to the Orias system.

597
00:30:51,818 --> 00:30:55,052
It might be worth your sending
one of your warships there

598
00:30:55,091 --> 00:30:57,288
just in case
the <i>Defiant</i> does show up.

599
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:00,733
All right.

600
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:02,295
Contact Gul Ranor.

601
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:05,402
Tell him to dispatch
one warship...

602
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:06,471
No.

603
00:31:07,683 --> 00:31:10,280
You'll send no ships
to the Orias system.

604
00:31:10,321 --> 00:31:12,018
You're here as an observer.

605
00:31:12,058 --> 00:31:13,492
You have no authority.

606
00:31:13,528 --> 00:31:14,553
That sector is

607
00:31:14,597 --> 00:31:16,965
under direct control
of the Obsidian Order

608
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:18,493
and you will not enter it.

609
00:31:18,538 --> 00:31:19,665
Why?!

610
00:31:19,707 --> 00:31:21,574
That matter's classified.

611
00:31:21,611 --> 00:31:22,874
Well.

612
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:27,719
You can file a complaint
with the Central Command later.

613
00:31:27,757 --> 00:31:30,388
Open a channel
to Gul Ranor now.

614
00:31:30,429 --> 00:31:32,695
Any warship sent
into the Orias system

615
00:31:32,733 --> 00:31:34,464
will be destroyed.

616
00:31:34,504 --> 00:31:37,169
Are you saying
that you will fire

617
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:39,405
on another Cardassian ship?

618
00:31:39,447 --> 00:31:42,544
What I am saying is
that the Obsidian Order

619
00:31:42,586 --> 00:31:45,319
will take whatever steps
are necessary

620
00:31:45,358 --> 00:31:47,419
to protect the Orias system.

621
00:31:47,463 --> 00:31:49,262
And so will I.

622
00:32:10,943 --> 00:32:14,245
I've spoken to a few friends
in the Central Command.

623
00:32:14,282 --> 00:32:16,752
The Obsidian Order isn't giving
them any answers, either.

624
00:32:16,788 --> 00:32:19,122
The Order has to answer
to someone.

625
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:20,525
In theory, they answer

626
00:32:20,562 --> 00:32:23,591
to the political authority
of the Detapa Council

627
00:32:23,635 --> 00:32:25,298
just as the military does.

628
00:32:25,338 --> 00:32:28,105
In practice, we both
run our own affairs.

629
00:32:28,144 --> 00:32:29,841
Not a very efficient system.

630
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:32,614
It's worked
for over five centuries.

631
00:32:32,653 --> 00:32:36,821
There's an incoming message
from the Warship <i>Kraxon.</i>

632
00:32:36,861 --> 00:32:39,297
They say they've found
an unusual neutrino signature

633
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,357
in their sector.

634
00:32:40,401 --> 00:32:41,869
It looks like radiation

635
00:32:41,905 --> 00:32:43,841
from a damaged
warp plasma relay.

636
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:45,572
Is this signature moving?

637
00:32:45,612 --> 00:32:48,105
No, but they're scanning
their area

638
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,177
with their antiproton beams.

639
00:32:50,221 --> 00:32:51,450
Where is the <i>Kraxon?</i>

640
00:32:57,168 --> 00:32:59,536
If it is the <i>Defiant,</i>
they're in position

641
00:32:59,574 --> 00:33:01,601
to make a run
for the Orias system.

642
00:33:01,644 --> 00:33:04,639
We still don't know
that Orias is the target.

643
00:33:04,684 --> 00:33:06,381
Until we do, I can't risk

644
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,620
pulling ships away from
other potential targets

645
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,188
to chase down
a neutrino signature.

646
00:33:14,435 --> 00:33:16,098
They're coming around
for another pass.

647
00:33:16,139 --> 00:33:17,938
Are there any other ships
nearby?

648
00:33:17,976 --> 00:33:20,675
There are nine
Galor-class cruisers

649
00:33:20,715 --> 00:33:22,013
about six light-years away.

650
00:33:22,051 --> 00:33:24,146
Any ships between us
and the Orias system?

651
00:33:24,188 --> 00:33:25,156
No.

652
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,317
If you make a run for it

653
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:27,486
that ship out there's
going to see

654
00:33:27,529 --> 00:33:29,431
our neutrino signature
go through a phase change.

655
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,865
They're going to call
their nine friends

656
00:33:30,902 --> 00:33:32,462
and you are going to have
a small fleet

657
00:33:32,505 --> 00:33:33,871
chasing you
all the way to Orias.

658
00:33:33,908 --> 00:33:37,312
They can chase me
all they want...

659
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,318
as long as they don't catch me.

660
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:40,615
The <i>Kraxon</i> reports

661
00:33:40,655 --> 00:33:43,422
that the neutrino signature
has just phase-shifted

662
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,623
and is moving now at warp speed

663
00:33:45,698 --> 00:33:47,964
directly
toward the Orias system.

664
00:33:48,003 --> 00:33:51,134
Order the <i>Kraxon</i>
to pursue at maximum warp.

665
00:33:51,176 --> 00:33:54,148
Order all other ships
in the sector to follow.

666
00:33:54,182 --> 00:33:56,015
The <i>Kraxon</i> is pursuing

667
00:33:56,052 --> 00:33:57,783
but they won't catch us
before we reach Orias.

668
00:33:57,823 --> 00:33:58,984
Full scan.

669
00:33:59,025 --> 00:34:01,461
I want to see everything
that's in that system.

670
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,835
When you make out your report
for the Obsidian Order

671
00:34:05,872 --> 00:34:09,003
be sure to mention the fact
that I could have prevented

672
00:34:09,045 --> 00:34:11,608
the <i>Defiant</i> from reaching Orias,
if you hadn't interfered.

673
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:14,052
They will never reach Orias.

674
00:34:14,088 --> 00:34:16,024
You can count on that.

675
00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:18,086
Three more ships
have just appeared

676
00:34:18,129 --> 00:34:19,427
in the Orias system.

677
00:34:19,465 --> 00:34:21,094
What kind of ships?

678
00:34:21,135 --> 00:34:24,939
Cardassian warships...
Keldon-class.

679
00:34:24,977 --> 00:34:27,642
Whose ships are those, Korinas?

680
00:34:27,682 --> 00:34:29,652
Why are you asking me?

681
00:34:29,686 --> 00:34:32,054
Because if they
were military ships

682
00:34:32,091 --> 00:34:33,651
I would know about them.

683
00:34:33,761 --> 00:34:36,163
So that leaves
the Obsidian Order.

684
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,069
I thought the Obsidian Order
didn't have any ships.

685
00:34:39,105 --> 00:34:40,471
They're not supposed to.

686
00:34:40,507 --> 00:34:42,636
In fact, they are
explicitly forbidden

687
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:46,312
from having military equipment
of any kind.

688
00:34:52,766 --> 00:34:55,294
It looks like we're going to
have to fight our way to Orias.

689
00:34:55,337 --> 00:34:56,498
Listen to me.

690
00:34:56,539 --> 00:34:58,304
Those three ships up ahead

691
00:34:58,343 --> 00:35:01,645
are going to lock onto our
neutrino leak and open fire.

692
00:35:01,717 --> 00:35:03,584
That means you're going
to have to fight back.

693
00:35:03,621 --> 00:35:05,887
With this ship, it'll be a short
fight, I promise you that.

694
00:35:05,925 --> 00:35:07,451
Let's say you disable

695
00:35:07,494 --> 00:35:09,964
or even destroy, those
three ships up ahead of us.

696
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,266
Fighting them at all
is going to slow us down.

697
00:35:12,304 --> 00:35:13,967
And then those ten ships
behind us

698
00:35:14,008 --> 00:35:15,203
are going to catch up.

699
00:35:15,243 --> 00:35:17,577
And not even the <i>Defiant</i>
can win against those odds.

700
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,083
We have come too far
to quit now.

701
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:22,090
You are an experienced
Starfleet officer, Tom.

702
00:35:22,124 --> 00:35:23,558
Analyze the situation.

703
00:35:23,593 --> 00:35:25,290
Going to Orias is suicide.

704
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:29,168
Now, the smart move is to make
a run for it while we still can.

705
00:35:29,205 --> 00:35:32,575
Maybe that's what an experienced
Starfleet officer would do

706
00:35:32,611 --> 00:35:34,079
maybe that's what
Will Riker would do

707
00:35:34,115 --> 00:35:36,051
but it's not
what I'm going to do.

708
00:35:36,085 --> 00:35:37,519
I'm going to continue
the mission.

709
00:35:37,554 --> 00:35:39,547
It's not the mission
you're thinking about, is it?

710
00:35:39,592 --> 00:35:41,459
Or even the colonists
in the Zone.

711
00:35:41,496 --> 00:35:42,862
This is about you, isn't it?

712
00:35:42,899 --> 00:35:44,732
You and that other Will Riker
out there.

713
00:35:44,803 --> 00:35:47,000
The man with your face,
your name, your career.

714
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:49,638
You are looking for a way
to set yourself apart.

715
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,080
Some way to be different.

716
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:53,517
You shouldn't go fishing today.

717
00:35:53,553 --> 00:35:55,546
You won't catch anything.

718
00:35:57,061 --> 00:35:58,427
Take us in.

719
00:36:08,616 --> 00:36:12,681
You want to know what's going on
in the Orias system

720
00:36:12,726 --> 00:36:14,992
I know how you can find out.

721
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,330
Give Riker a chance
to surrender.

722
00:36:17,367 --> 00:36:20,567
The <i>Defiant's</i> scanned
the Orias system by now.

723
00:36:20,607 --> 00:36:24,604
Its sensor logs can tell you
everything you want to know.

724
00:36:24,648 --> 00:36:27,141
I'd be happy to accept
his surrender

725
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:29,750
but I doubt he'll be willing
to hand over his logs.

726
00:36:29,826 --> 00:36:32,354
He will, if you agree
to release Major Kira

727
00:36:32,397 --> 00:36:35,528
turn the ship and the Maquis
over to the Federation.

728
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:36,663
Impossible!

729
00:36:36,707 --> 00:36:39,474
I cannot allow a group
of terrorists

730
00:36:39,512 --> 00:36:43,145
to just walk away
after invading our territory...

731
00:36:43,186 --> 00:36:46,215
Then you must decide
which is important to you...

732
00:36:46,259 --> 00:36:48,161
your sense of Cardassian justice

733
00:36:48,196 --> 00:36:51,863
or the information contained
in the <i>Defiant's</i> sensor logs.

734
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:56,573
I do want that information,
Commander

735
00:36:56,612 --> 00:37:00,177
and I would be willing
to return your wayward ship

736
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,748
but someone has to pay
for what's happened here

737
00:37:02,826 --> 00:37:05,126
and I don't want
that someone to be me.

738
00:37:05,163 --> 00:37:07,395
If you return the Maquis
to the Federation

739
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,768
I can promise you
that they will stand trial

740
00:37:09,873 --> 00:37:11,068
for what they've done.

741
00:37:11,108 --> 00:37:12,941
A Federation trial.

742
00:37:12,979 --> 00:37:14,710
It's the best I can do.

743
00:37:15,852 --> 00:37:17,378
All right.

744
00:37:17,421 --> 00:37:21,293
I would be willing to hand over

745
00:37:21,329 --> 00:37:25,565
Major Kira, the Maquis
and the ship

746
00:37:25,604 --> 00:37:27,267
but not Riker.

747
00:37:27,307 --> 00:37:29,607
He led the mission.

748
00:37:29,645 --> 00:37:32,378
If I can bring him to justice

749
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:35,787
and obtain the information
on Orias

750
00:37:35,825 --> 00:37:39,025
that might be enough
for Central Command.

751
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:55,628
I might be able to get him
to do it, on one condition.

752
00:37:55,664 --> 00:37:58,329
We both know
that Cardassian sentences

753
00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:01,535
are determined
well in advance of the trial.

754
00:38:01,575 --> 00:38:05,572
I'd like you to arrange
a sentence other than death.

755
00:38:10,293 --> 00:38:14,324
I'll have to clear that
with the Ministry of Justice.

756
00:38:15,537 --> 00:38:17,404
You'd better make it quick.

757
00:38:28,629 --> 00:38:30,690
We're approaching
the first cruiser.

758
00:38:30,734 --> 00:38:33,068
They'll be in phaser range
in 15 seconds.

759
00:38:34,408 --> 00:38:35,569
Go to impulse.

760
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:36,873
De-cloak the ship.

761
00:38:36,913 --> 00:38:39,885
Raise shields
and stand by phasers.

762
00:38:39,953 --> 00:38:43,893
Go to heading 118 mark 310.

763
00:38:43,994 --> 00:38:46,557
Lock on phasers.

764
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,159
Fire.

765
00:38:52,177 --> 00:38:54,910
Direct hit on the cruiser's
port nacelle.

766
00:38:55,016 --> 00:38:57,579
Their shields
are down by 30 percent.

767
00:38:57,621 --> 00:38:59,853
We've been hit
on our starboard shield.

768
00:39:07,007 --> 00:39:08,704
Shields holding.

769
00:39:08,743 --> 00:39:10,713
Quantum torpedoes...
full spread.

770
00:39:10,747 --> 00:39:12,181
Torpedoes locked on target.

771
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:13,446
Fire!

772
00:39:18,296 --> 00:39:19,890
Their defense systems
are off-line

773
00:39:19,966 --> 00:39:22,402
and they've lost main power.

774
00:39:22,437 --> 00:39:23,405
Tom, three more cruisers

775
00:39:23,439 --> 00:39:24,873
have just appeared
in the Orias system.

776
00:39:24,909 --> 00:39:26,811
That makes five ships
ahead of us and ten behind.

777
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:31,281
Resume our original course
to the Orias system.

778
00:39:31,322 --> 00:39:33,417
Stand by emergency
power to the shields.

779
00:39:33,459 --> 00:39:35,929
Incoming message
from Cardassia Prime.

780
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:39,129
It's Gul Dukat
and Commander Sisko.

781
00:39:41,575 --> 00:39:43,066
On screen.

782
00:39:43,112 --> 00:39:46,141
This is Gul Dukat
of the Second Order.

783
00:39:46,185 --> 00:39:49,886
I am authorized to tell you
that if you surrender your ship

784
00:39:49,926 --> 00:39:52,158
none of you will be harmed.

785
00:39:52,197 --> 00:39:53,426
Is that right?

786
00:39:55,503 --> 00:39:56,971
Listen to him, Lieutenant.

787
00:39:57,073 --> 00:39:59,566
If you surrender,
the <i>Defiant</i> and its crew

788
00:39:59,611 --> 00:40:02,208
will be handed over
to a Federation starship

789
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,741
at the Cardassian border.

790
00:40:03,786 --> 00:40:05,380
Why the sudden generosity?

791
00:40:05,423 --> 00:40:08,827
He wants the <i>Defiant's</i> sensor
logs on the Orias system.

792
00:40:08,863 --> 00:40:12,302
They're worth a lot more
to him than Maquis prisoners.

793
00:40:12,337 --> 00:40:13,568
I don't buy it.

794
00:40:13,701 --> 00:40:16,696
The Cardassians aren't going
to just let us walk away.

795
00:40:16,741 --> 00:40:17,834
You're right.

796
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:20,780
Someone has to pay the price.

797
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,087
Me.

798
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:25,114
The deal is

799
00:40:25,158 --> 00:40:27,857
you'll be tried and convicted
in a Cardassian court

800
00:40:27,896 --> 00:40:30,493
and then sentenced
to spend the rest of your life

801
00:40:30,535 --> 00:40:33,473
in the Lazon II labor camp.

802
00:40:33,508 --> 00:40:35,876
No death sentence, huh?

803
00:40:35,912 --> 00:40:38,075
That must have taken some doing.

804
00:40:39,586 --> 00:40:40,611
Some.

805
00:40:40,655 --> 00:40:43,354
Give me a moment.

806
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,206
Tom.

807
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:57,181
There's no reason
for you to continue.

808
00:40:57,222 --> 00:40:58,622
They're offering you a way out.

809
00:40:58,658 --> 00:41:01,255
The only reason not to take it
is because you want to die.

810
00:41:01,297 --> 00:41:02,891
I have a mission to complete.

811
00:41:02,933 --> 00:41:03,992
That mission is over.

812
00:41:04,036 --> 00:41:06,336
You're never going
to make it to Orias.

813
00:41:06,373 --> 00:41:07,500
You know that, Tom.

814
00:41:07,542 --> 00:41:10,012
There are five ships
out there ahead of you

815
00:41:10,048 --> 00:41:13,020
but there may be 50 waiting
there, for all we know.

816
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:16,220
Be a Starfleet
officer one last time.

817
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,923
Think of your crew.

818
00:41:17,963 --> 00:41:20,730
I know you want Tom Riker
to go out in a blaze of glory

819
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,966
that they talk about
for the next ten years.

820
00:41:23,007 --> 00:41:26,173
Don't drag them along with you.

821
00:41:34,396 --> 00:41:35,455
On screen.

822
00:41:39,339 --> 00:41:40,933
I agree to your terms.

823
00:41:40,975 --> 00:41:44,745
You need to reverse course
and surrender the <i>Defiant</i>

824
00:41:44,783 --> 00:41:46,776
to one of the ships
that's been following you.

825
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:47,811
Why?

826
00:41:47,856 --> 00:41:49,621
It will take too long to explain

827
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:52,359
but the ships coming out
of the Orias system

828
00:41:52,399 --> 00:41:54,494
are not
under Gul Dukat's control.

829
00:41:54,536 --> 00:41:55,504
I see.

830
00:41:55,538 --> 00:41:56,870
I've ordered the <i>Kraxon</i>

831
00:41:56,941 --> 00:42:00,038
to put her shields around you
as soon as you arrive.

832
00:42:00,081 --> 00:42:02,108
You'll be safe
once you get there.

833
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:03,586
Understood.

834
00:42:09,066 --> 00:42:10,091
Turn us about.

835
00:42:10,134 --> 00:42:12,127
Lay in a course for the <i>Kraxon.</i>

836
00:42:13,674 --> 00:42:14,801
Do it.

837
00:42:22,392 --> 00:42:25,023
Those are faster
than any Keldon-class ships

838
00:42:25,064 --> 00:42:27,034
I've ever seen.

839
00:42:27,068 --> 00:42:29,631
What is going on in that system?

840
00:42:30,842 --> 00:42:33,074
We're 100 million kilometers
from the <i>Kraxon.</i>

841
00:42:33,114 --> 00:42:34,309
Incoming message.

842
00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:35,578
Let's hear it.

843
00:42:35,618 --> 00:42:37,520
This is Gul Ranor of the <i>Kraxon.</i>

844
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,457
Cut your engines in five seconds

845
00:42:39,493 --> 00:42:41,895
and we will extend
our shields around you.

846
00:42:41,997 --> 00:42:43,864
Acknowledged.

847
00:42:43,901 --> 00:42:44,960
Kalita.

848
00:42:47,876 --> 00:42:49,037
All stop.

849
00:43:13,327 --> 00:43:16,629
They won't fire
on another Cardassian ship.

850
00:43:17,836 --> 00:43:19,134
They can't.

851
00:43:23,748 --> 00:43:25,445
They're moving off.

852
00:43:25,485 --> 00:43:28,048
They've set course
back to the Orias system.

853
00:43:28,089 --> 00:43:31,186
Transmit the Orias III
sensor logs to the <i>Kraxon</i>

854
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:34,532
and tell them to prepare
to beam me aboard.

855
00:43:34,569 --> 00:43:37,336
I'm turning command over
to Major Kira.

856
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:40,404
She'll get you back
to the Federation.

857
00:43:40,448 --> 00:43:42,475
I'm holding you
personally responsible

858
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:44,785
to see that these people get
a fair trial.

859
00:43:44,823 --> 00:43:47,157
I give you my word.

860
00:43:49,733 --> 00:43:51,828
We'll get you out of there, Tom.

861
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:53,533
I promise you that.

862
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:12,369
Riker to <i>Kraxon.</i>

863
00:44:12,412 --> 00:44:13,539
Go ahead.

864
00:44:13,581 --> 00:44:15,244
One to beam up.

865
00:44:23,133 --> 00:44:25,399
Set course for the Federation.

866
00:44:27,575 --> 00:44:28,907
Warp eight.
