1
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:07,966
And I've downloaded

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,980
the new docking procedure
checklist for Bay 6

3
00:00:10,014 --> 00:00:11,175
into the Bay-Prod D-9 file.

4
00:00:11,284 --> 00:00:14,188
That's the only bay
using the new criteria.

5
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:15,522
Got it.

6
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:17,552
And be sure to monitor
the power fluctuations

7
00:00:17,597 --> 00:00:19,032
in the secondary fusion core.

8
00:00:19,067 --> 00:00:21,698
It's got some little kinks in
there I don't like the look of.

9
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:23,470
I will care for the
secondary fusion core

10
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:24,535
like it was my own child.

11
00:00:24,578 --> 00:00:26,377
As soon as I get back,
I'm going to run

12
00:00:26,417 --> 00:00:28,547
a full diagnostic,
to make sure there's no...

13
00:00:28,587 --> 00:00:29,954
Chief! We are perfectly capable

14
00:00:29,991 --> 00:00:32,121
of running this place
by ourselves for a week.

15
00:00:32,163 --> 00:00:34,498
Well, if you have any problems
you can reach me on subspace...

16
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:38,305
Would you please go on vacation
and get out of our hair?

17
00:00:42,452 --> 00:00:43,420
Miles.

18
00:00:43,454 --> 00:00:44,422
Yeah?

19
00:00:44,456 --> 00:00:46,654
Have a good time.

20
00:00:46,694 --> 00:00:47,753
Oh, right.

21
00:00:47,796 --> 00:00:49,265
Thanks, yeah.

22
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,828
I feel relaxed already.

23
00:00:55,547 --> 00:00:56,776
Is he gone?

24
00:00:56,816 --> 00:00:58,285
Finally.

25
00:00:58,353 --> 00:01:00,380
Good. He's been driving me
crazy all day.

26
00:01:00,424 --> 00:01:01,723
You'd think that I was...

27
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:03,162
Commander...

28
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:04,165
I forgot to tell you.

29
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:05,224
I added a new subroutine

30
00:01:05,335 --> 00:01:07,396
to the environmental control
in the Habitat Ring...

31
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,567
Chief O'Brien.

32
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:10,078
Yes, sir?

33
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,581
You're on leave.

34
00:01:11,616 --> 00:01:13,518
Please disembark this station.

35
00:01:13,553 --> 00:01:15,649
Aye, sir.

36
00:01:24,243 --> 00:01:25,712
It's okay.

37
00:01:28,987 --> 00:01:30,479
Boone!

38
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:31,718
O'Brien.

39
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,728
Miles O'Brien.

40
00:01:32,762 --> 00:01:34,163
We served together
on the <i>Rutledge.</i>

41
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:35,463
Of course! O'Brien.

42
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:37,300
Oh, it's been a long time.

43
00:01:37,339 --> 00:01:38,568
How are you doing?

44
00:01:38,608 --> 00:01:39,907
I'm fine, just fine.

45
00:01:39,945 --> 00:01:42,542
I work on this station now.
Chief Engineer.

46
00:01:42,584 --> 00:01:43,677
Is that a fact?

47
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,313
Yeah. How long you been
out of Starfleet?

48
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:47,416
Oh, about eight years now.
I settled on Volon III.

49
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:49,021
Well, that's
on the Cardassian side

50
00:01:49,065 --> 00:01:50,694
of the Demilitarized Zone,
isn't it?

51
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:53,799
Yes. Well, the new treaty, it
really puts us in harm's way.

52
00:01:53,841 --> 00:01:55,470
But I run a ladarium
mining sluice

53
00:01:55,512 --> 00:01:57,608
so as long as the Cardassians
need ladarium

54
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,746
for their warp drives,
they leave me alone.

55
00:01:59,788 --> 00:02:02,589
Well, after what we went
through in the border wars

56
00:02:02,628 --> 00:02:04,895
I don't know
how you can live there.

57
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:06,630
You were there at Setlik III.

58
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,264
That's what got me
out of Starfleet.

59
00:02:08,307 --> 00:02:11,177
Really?
That's why I stayed in.

60
00:02:11,213 --> 00:02:12,807
Listen, my wife
is waiting for me

61
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,786
and she hates it when I'm late,
and I always am.

62
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:15,948
I'm coming back

63
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,516
for another supply pickup
in a month or two.

64
00:02:17,561 --> 00:02:18,654
Okay, let me know when.

65
00:02:37,638 --> 00:02:39,574
O'Brien, Miles O'Brien.

66
00:02:39,609 --> 00:02:41,842
We served together
on the <i>Rutledge.</i>

67
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,284
Miles?

68
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,447
Uh-huh?

69
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,392
Didn't you bring the holo-cam?

70
00:04:49,427 --> 00:04:51,056
Was I supposed to?

71
00:04:51,098 --> 00:04:52,965
You said you were going to.

72
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:54,938
Did I?

73
00:04:54,973 --> 00:04:58,538
Last night, when we were
going over the list in bed.

74
00:04:58,614 --> 00:05:00,083
Not me.

75
00:05:00,118 --> 00:05:03,216
I was dead as soon as my head
hit the pillow.

76
00:05:03,257 --> 00:05:05,956
You talked to me
for half an hour.

77
00:05:05,997 --> 00:05:09,870
No, there must have been
someone else in bed with us.

78
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,243
What's this?

79
00:05:15,284 --> 00:05:18,120
Oh, just some new
technical update manuals.

80
00:05:18,157 --> 00:05:20,390
Our first vacation
in five years

81
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:23,333
and you brought
technical update manuals?

82
00:05:23,369 --> 00:05:26,672
You know, maybe we should
have brought Molly with us.

83
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,649
Do you think she'll be okay
with the Petersons?

84
00:05:29,682 --> 00:05:32,849
She likes the Petersons
more than she likes us.

85
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:34,449
She's fine.

86
00:05:34,493 --> 00:05:38,696
We could swing back, pick up
the holo-cam and Molly

87
00:05:38,736 --> 00:05:41,173
and still only lose
about half a day.

88
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,338
Or we could pick up
the holo-cam

89
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,715
when we get there.

90
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:48,120
How many did you bring?

91
00:05:48,156 --> 00:05:49,591
What?

92
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:52,962
Tech update manuals?

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,765
Just a few.

94
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:06,597
Computer, play something
by... Minezaki.

95
00:06:47,286 --> 00:06:50,657
Do these chairs recline?

96
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:52,526
I wish they did.

97
00:06:52,564 --> 00:06:54,056
You're an engineer.

98
00:06:54,101 --> 00:06:55,661
Do something about it.

99
00:06:55,738 --> 00:06:57,902
I'll make it worth your while.

100
00:06:57,943 --> 00:06:59,172
Mmm...

101
00:06:59,212 --> 00:07:00,613
Vessel approaching.

102
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:03,781
Bearing 191 mark 6.

103
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:06,225
Identify.

104
00:07:06,261 --> 00:07:08,357
Cardassian patrol ship,
Hideki-class.

105
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:11,238
Shields up!

106
00:07:18,422 --> 00:07:21,827
Try to send an emergency
subspace signal to the station.

107
00:07:21,864 --> 00:07:23,527
I... I can't.

108
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,470
They're jamming all
subspace frequencies.

109
00:07:25,505 --> 00:07:26,666
They're hailing us.

110
00:07:28,111 --> 00:07:32,416
This is Miles O'Brien
of Starbase Deep Space 9.

111
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:33,945
State your business.

112
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,823
Mr. O'Brien,
we've spoken before.

113
00:07:35,861 --> 00:07:37,160
My name is Evek.

114
00:07:37,197 --> 00:07:39,794
Shut down your drive,
and come to a full stop.

115
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:42,103
We're beaming
an inspection team aboard.

116
00:07:42,142 --> 00:07:43,941
We're nowhere near
the Cardassian border.

117
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:45,573
You've no authority here.

118
00:07:45,616 --> 00:07:47,483
We'll argue
about authority later.

119
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,012
For now,
you will either comply

120
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,753
or we will take
preemptive action.

121
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:52,457
Warning.

122
00:07:52,497 --> 00:07:55,162
Sensors are reading
photo lock-on activation.

123
00:07:55,204 --> 00:07:56,935
You have ten seconds.

124
00:08:00,215 --> 00:08:01,707
Don't worry.

125
00:08:01,751 --> 00:08:03,448
We haven't done anything.

126
00:08:04,758 --> 00:08:06,455
Thank you
for your cooperation.

127
00:08:06,495 --> 00:08:08,488
I have orders to arrest you,
Mr. O'Brien.

128
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:09,501
Arrest?

129
00:08:09,535 --> 00:08:10,503
Search the ship.

130
00:08:10,537 --> 00:08:11,938
What are the charges?

131
00:08:11,974 --> 00:08:13,807
You have the right to refuse
to answer questions

132
00:08:13,845 --> 00:08:16,373
but such refusal may be
construed as a sign of guilt.

133
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:19,218
I demand to know
what I'm being accused of.

134
00:08:19,256 --> 00:08:21,659
You deny all knowledge
of this crime, then?

135
00:08:21,695 --> 00:08:23,528
How the hell am I supposed
to deny something

136
00:08:23,566 --> 00:08:25,433
when I don't know what
you're talking about?

137
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,495
So you do not
deny all knowledge?

138
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:29,375
We are Federation citizens
and we have rights.

139
00:08:29,412 --> 00:08:30,938
Yes, yes, all your rights

140
00:08:30,982 --> 00:08:34,012
as defined by Cardassian
Articles of Jurisprudence

141
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,148
will be protected.

142
00:08:35,191 --> 00:08:38,562
I demand to speak
to my Commander.

143
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,900
We will contact your Commander

144
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,030
and see that your wife

145
00:08:42,073 --> 00:08:43,872
is returned safely
to your station.

146
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:46,314
You will be taken
to Central Prison

147
00:08:46,349 --> 00:08:48,046
on Cardassia Prime
to await trial.

148
00:08:48,086 --> 00:08:50,284
All right.

149
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:52,694
I'm not going anywhere with you.

150
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,671
Miles!
Miles!

151
00:08:58,042 --> 00:09:00,103
No!

152
00:09:02,117 --> 00:09:06,856
Miles!
Miles!

153
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:12,705
Look to the children.

154
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,541
They are the future
of Cardassia

155
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,211
and they will lead the way.

156
00:09:18,252 --> 00:09:21,088
Invest in their minds.

157
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,890
Teach them carefully...

158
00:09:26,036 --> 00:09:28,507
Remove your clothes.

159
00:09:31,415 --> 00:09:33,716
My name's Miles O'Brien.

160
00:09:33,754 --> 00:09:36,555
My rank, Chief of Operations,
Starfleet.

161
00:09:36,593 --> 00:09:39,394
I'm a Federation citizen.

162
00:09:39,432 --> 00:09:41,026
Remove your clothes.

163
00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:44,137
My name is Miles O'Brien.

164
00:09:44,176 --> 00:09:46,841
My rank is Chief of Operations,
Starfleet.

165
00:09:46,882 --> 00:09:48,351
I'm a Federation citizen.

166
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:06,781
Would you care to make
a confession?

167
00:10:08,697 --> 00:10:10,530
My name is Miles O'Brien.

168
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,632
My rank is Chief of Operations,
Starfleet.

169
00:10:13,675 --> 00:10:16,078
I am a citizen
of the Federation!

170
00:10:16,113 --> 00:10:17,639
Process him.

171
00:10:53,562 --> 00:10:56,466
My name is...

172
00:10:56,502 --> 00:10:58,301
Miles...

173
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:00,742
O'Brien.

174
00:11:04,118 --> 00:11:07,022
My rank is...

175
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:10,932
Chief of...

176
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:17,306
Operations...

177
00:11:32,648 --> 00:11:33,947
Has he been processed?

178
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,351
He has.

179
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:43,500
You were told he was
not to be harmed.

180
00:11:43,538 --> 00:11:44,802
He had to be restrained.

181
00:11:44,841 --> 00:11:46,036
Bring him his clothing.

182
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,650
I apologize for the way

183
00:11:53,694 --> 00:11:56,063
you've been treated,
Mr. O'Brien.

184
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:59,504
I'm Makbar, Chief Archon.

185
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,169
I want your stay here

186
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,271
to be as comfortable
as possible

187
00:12:03,315 --> 00:12:04,944
under the circumstances.

188
00:12:04,986 --> 00:12:09,018
I've scheduled your trial
to begin in two days.

189
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,624
You've been assigned
the venerable Kovat

190
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:13,261
as public conservator.

191
00:12:13,304 --> 00:12:14,329
As what?

192
00:12:14,373 --> 00:12:15,706
Your lawyer.

193
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:19,012
Many feel that he's the best
counsel in all Cardassia.

194
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,783
What do I need a lawyer for?

195
00:12:21,822 --> 00:12:24,020
What am I charged with?

196
00:12:24,061 --> 00:12:25,655
Who's accusing me?

197
00:12:25,698 --> 00:12:29,730
All in good time, Mr. O'Brien.

198
00:12:29,774 --> 00:12:31,801
All in good time.

199
00:12:40,497 --> 00:12:42,730
Starfleet has ordered
the <i>Enterprise</i>

200
00:12:42,768 --> 00:12:44,670
the <i>Prokofiev</i>
and the <i>Valdemar</i>

201
00:12:44,706 --> 00:12:46,539
to the border
of the Demilitarized Zone.

202
00:12:46,577 --> 00:12:48,240
Hopefully,
when the Cardassians see

203
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:50,411
that they are risking the
entire treaty over this...

204
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,617
In the meantime, my husband
is being violated by them.

205
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:55,857
Every shred of his humanity
is being violated.

206
00:12:55,897 --> 00:12:57,264
Isn't that true?

207
00:12:57,301 --> 00:12:58,895
We don't know exactly...

208
00:12:58,938 --> 00:13:00,271
Damn it!
Don't lie to me!

209
00:13:00,307 --> 00:13:03,074
They're torturing him
as we sit here.

210
00:13:03,114 --> 00:13:05,847
It is standard procedure
for the Cardassians

211
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:08,323
to use torture
in their interrogations.

212
00:13:08,358 --> 00:13:09,918
You are correct, Mrs. O'Brien.

213
00:13:12,601 --> 00:13:15,802
You don't know how many times
Miles spoke to me about this...

214
00:13:15,841 --> 00:13:16,900
what the Cardassians did

215
00:13:16,943 --> 00:13:18,810
to the prisoners
they took at Setlik III.

216
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:21,512
What they were like
when they came back.

217
00:13:21,554 --> 00:13:24,584
The thought of it,
it disgusted him.

218
00:13:24,627 --> 00:13:25,788
It scared him.

219
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,028
We can't leave him there.

220
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:31,769
We don't even know where he's
being held on Cardassia Prime.

221
00:13:35,994 --> 00:13:36,893
Keiko, I promise you

222
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,627
as soon as we have
more information

223
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,865
I'll do everything
in my power to...

224
00:13:40,905 --> 00:13:42,738
Commander, you have
a subspace transmission

225
00:13:42,776 --> 00:13:43,766
from Cardassia Prime.

226
00:13:45,114 --> 00:13:46,981
On screen.

227
00:13:49,992 --> 00:13:53,557
I'm Benjamin Sisko,
Commander of Deep Space 9.

228
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,296
My name is Makbar.

229
00:13:55,337 --> 00:13:58,333
I'm the Archon representing
the Cardassian Empire

230
00:13:58,377 --> 00:14:00,780
in its case
against Miles O'Brien.

231
00:14:00,816 --> 00:14:02,183
May I speak with him?

232
00:14:02,218 --> 00:14:03,710
That is not possible.

233
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:04,586
May I see him?

234
00:14:04,623 --> 00:14:05,818
- Commander...
- May I be assured

235
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,727
that he is well
and being treated properly?

236
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:12,364
Mr. O'Brien is being treated
with great care and respect.

237
00:14:12,408 --> 00:14:13,968
Good, because if he is not

238
00:14:14,012 --> 00:14:16,245
I will hold you
personally responsible.

239
00:14:16,282 --> 00:14:18,981
And if that sounds
like a threat, it is.

240
00:14:19,023 --> 00:14:21,756
Gul Dukat's told me about you.

241
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:25,633
You live up
to your reputation, Commander.

242
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,162
That's right, I do.

243
00:14:27,206 --> 00:14:30,441
Now, what are the charges
against Chief O'Brien?

244
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,578
The charges will be announced
when the trial begins

245
00:14:33,621 --> 00:14:36,320
as is customary
in Cardassian jurisprudence.

246
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,490
How can we prepare
for the trial

247
00:14:38,532 --> 00:14:40,502
if we don't know the charges?

248
00:14:40,536 --> 00:14:42,529
Mrs. O'Brien, I take it?

249
00:14:42,574 --> 00:14:43,803
Yes.

250
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,641
Mrs. O'Brien, there's nothing
for you to prepare.

251
00:14:45,681 --> 00:14:48,278
Your husband's verdict
has already been determined.

252
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,288
He is guilty.

253
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:51,019
The trial will reveal

254
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:54,055
how this guilt was proven
by the most efficient

255
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,970
criminal investigation system
in the Quadrant.

256
00:14:57,005 --> 00:15:00,570
You may, if you desire,
attend this trial, which begins

257
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:02,082
in two days' time.

258
00:15:02,117 --> 00:15:03,586
We'll be there.

259
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,987
Oh, I'm sorry, Commander.

260
00:15:05,023 --> 00:15:06,515
This is a privilege

261
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,499
enjoyed solely by the spouse
of an offender.

262
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:10,934
What about his nestor?

263
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,775
His counsel and his nestor
will be assigned by the court.

264
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:16,337
Nestor?

265
00:15:16,381 --> 00:15:18,180
Advisor to the offender.

266
00:15:18,219 --> 00:15:22,320
Madam Archon, I volunteer to
serve as nestor in this trial.

267
00:15:22,362 --> 00:15:23,956
That is not possible.

268
00:15:23,998 --> 00:15:26,265
The nestor must be
an officer of the court.

269
00:15:26,303 --> 00:15:28,205
I am an officer of the court.

270
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:29,733
Chief of Security Odo.

271
00:15:29,777 --> 00:15:33,410
I served Gul Dukat on Terok Nor.

272
00:15:33,452 --> 00:15:35,012
You may check my credentials.

273
00:15:35,056 --> 00:15:38,154
I was designated an officer
of the Cardassian Court

274
00:15:38,196 --> 00:15:41,431
four years ago, in order
to testify in criminal cases.

275
00:15:41,469 --> 00:15:43,405
Very well.

276
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:45,844
If this is true,
you may accompany Mrs. O'Brien

277
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,645
and serve as nestor.

278
00:15:47,684 --> 00:15:51,146
May I ask, what penalty
does Mr. O'Brien face?

279
00:15:51,191 --> 00:15:54,528
His execution is scheduled
for next week.

280
00:15:54,565 --> 00:15:56,695
How can you schedule
an execution

281
00:15:56,737 --> 00:15:58,833
before a trial even begins?

282
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,471
We believe in swift justice.

283
00:16:03,184 --> 00:16:06,646
Mrs. O'Brien, we should
leave immediately.

284
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:10,527
Begin a complete security sweep
of the station

285
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:12,663
and Chief O'Brien's
recent activities.

286
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:16,167
I want to know if there's
anything out of the ordinary

287
00:16:16,213 --> 00:16:18,309
that might begin
to explain this.

288
00:16:18,351 --> 00:16:19,877
Commander, Chief
O'Brien's attitude

289
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,890
towards the Cardassians
is hardly a secret.

290
00:16:21,925 --> 00:16:24,522
What if he actually
has done something?

291
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,837
Then we need to know
that, too, don't we?

292
00:16:47,448 --> 00:16:49,885
Miles O'Brien?

293
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,721
Eh, yes, of course you are.

294
00:17:00,343 --> 00:17:04,307
I'm Conservator Kovat.

295
00:17:04,352 --> 00:17:07,256
I've been told that I've
already been charged

296
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,922
indicted, convicted
and sentenced.

297
00:17:09,998 --> 00:17:12,401
What would I need
with a lawyer?

298
00:17:12,436 --> 00:17:18,713
Ah, Mr. O'Brien, if it sounds
immodest of me, I apologize.

299
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,846
But the role
of public conservator

300
00:17:20,889 --> 00:17:24,853
is key to the productive
functioning of our courts.

301
00:17:24,897 --> 00:17:29,931
I'm here to help you concede
the wisdom of the state

302
00:17:29,974 --> 00:17:35,442
to prepare you to accept the
inevitable with equanimity.

303
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,512
Ha!

304
00:17:40,431 --> 00:17:44,805
There's an old
Cardassian expression:

305
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:47,608
"Confession is good
for the soul."

306
00:17:47,647 --> 00:17:50,586
But it's also good
for the populace to see

307
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,146
people like you confess.

308
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,320
It makes them feel better
about themselves.

309
00:17:54,362 --> 00:17:57,631
It makes them... makes their
lives... more bearable.

310
00:17:57,669 --> 00:18:00,402
So, that's what this
is all about?

311
00:18:00,442 --> 00:18:03,904
Make the people
of Cardassia feel better, huh?

312
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,680
No, no, no, no.

313
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,887
But that's...
that's not a bad side effect.

314
00:18:12,201 --> 00:18:15,606
Now then, we have
your biographical extracts.

315
00:18:15,642 --> 00:18:18,375
We have
your Starfleet records.

316
00:18:18,415 --> 00:18:20,909
All this will be very useful.

317
00:18:20,954 --> 00:18:23,448
What am I being charged with?

318
00:18:23,493 --> 00:18:28,163
Oh, no need to worry about that
at this point.

319
00:18:28,202 --> 00:18:30,035
This is insane!

320
00:18:30,107 --> 00:18:31,906
Now, whatever you've done

321
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:34,314
whatever the charges
against you

322
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:37,448
none of that really matters
in the long run.

323
00:18:37,489 --> 00:18:38,890
What does matter?

324
00:18:38,926 --> 00:18:41,659
This trial is to demonstrate

325
00:18:41,699 --> 00:18:46,038
the futility of behavior
contrary to good order.

326
00:18:46,076 --> 00:18:49,481
Everyone will find it
most uplifting.

327
00:18:49,516 --> 00:18:50,985
Not everyone.

328
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,887
Once again,
justice will be done.

329
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:56,797
Our lives will be reaffirmed,
safe and secure.

330
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,829
Here on Cardassia,
all crimes are solved

331
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:03,813
all criminals are punished,
all endings are happy.

332
00:19:03,848 --> 00:19:08,187
Even the poorest of our subjects
can walk the streets

333
00:19:08,224 --> 00:19:11,197
in the dead of night
in perfect safety.

334
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:15,764
You're only one man,
but your conviction

335
00:19:15,807 --> 00:19:20,750
will be a salutary experience
for millions.

336
00:19:21,821 --> 00:19:24,088
Now then...

337
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:26,186
the trial opens tomorrow.

338
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:30,763
Do you have any questions
anything you want to tell me?

339
00:19:30,807 --> 00:19:33,472
Only that I am not guilty
of any crime

340
00:19:33,513 --> 00:19:36,110
and that I hold
this entire procedure

341
00:19:36,186 --> 00:19:38,122
with nothing but contempt.

342
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,057
That's good, that's good.

343
00:19:40,094 --> 00:19:43,933
Maintain that level
of arrogance in the courtroom

344
00:19:43,969 --> 00:19:46,839
and we shall put on
a very good show, indeed.

345
00:19:46,876 --> 00:19:49,347
Oh, I do have one question.

346
00:19:49,381 --> 00:19:50,941
Yes, certainly.

347
00:19:50,984 --> 00:19:54,617
Have you ever won a case?

348
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:57,894
Winning isn't everything.

349
00:20:18,475 --> 00:20:19,670
Are they all like this?

350
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:20,679
All of them.

351
00:20:20,713 --> 00:20:23,480
There isn't a photon warhead
left in here.

352
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:24,783
How could somebody transport

353
00:20:24,822 --> 00:20:26,382
two dozen warheads
off this station

354
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:29,159
without the perimeter
sensors picking it up?

355
00:20:29,198 --> 00:20:31,031
The metal in these crates

356
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,337
has the same mass
as the warheads.

357
00:20:33,374 --> 00:20:35,470
A transporter
could have been programmed

358
00:20:35,513 --> 00:20:37,005
to switch the two
simultaneously.

359
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,180
The sensors could
have been fooled.

360
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,987
But it would require
a transporter expert.

361
00:20:42,027 --> 00:20:44,430
I know what you're implying,
Major, and I don't like it.

362
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:46,733
Neither do I,
but there is more.

363
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:50,073
According to the logs,
O'Brien was in here

364
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:52,412
just minutes before
his runabout left.

365
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,582
Computer, play
Security Log entry

366
00:20:55,623 --> 00:20:58,994
Stardate 47944.2...
weapons locker.

367
00:20:59,031 --> 00:21:04,270
Request access Weapons Locker 4,
Miles O'Brien

368
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:05,938
Security Level One.

369
00:21:05,979 --> 00:21:08,507
The computer confirmed
his voiceprint ID

370
00:21:08,551 --> 00:21:10,020
and let him in.

371
00:21:10,055 --> 00:21:11,991
As soon as the door opened

372
00:21:12,026 --> 00:21:14,327
some kind of
field saturation device

373
00:21:14,364 --> 00:21:17,462
was activated that froze all the
security scanners in the room.

374
00:21:17,505 --> 00:21:20,306
I want a full analysis
of that voiceprint.

375
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,748
Make absolutely sure
it was O'Brien.

376
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:24,981
But it doesn't make sense.

377
00:21:25,021 --> 00:21:26,854
What would he do
with photon warheads?

378
00:21:26,892 --> 00:21:28,327
Give them to the Maquis.

379
00:21:28,362 --> 00:21:30,161
We had an advisory two weeks ago

380
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:33,172
that a Maquis ship
disabled a Bolian freighter

381
00:21:33,206 --> 00:21:35,643
near the Demilitarized
Zone and stole

382
00:21:35,678 --> 00:21:37,580
a supply of photon launchers.

383
00:21:37,615 --> 00:21:39,141
Launchers but no warheads?

384
00:21:39,186 --> 00:21:41,680
Launchers, but no warheads.

385
00:21:41,724 --> 00:21:44,093
You're suggesting
that Miles O'Brien

386
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,533
took his wife
on a romantic vacation

387
00:21:46,569 --> 00:21:50,202
as an excuse to deliver
warheads to the Maquis?

388
00:21:50,243 --> 00:21:51,542
I don't believe it!

389
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,017
If these warheads were
in the runabout, they'll be used

390
00:21:54,052 --> 00:21:55,020
as evidence in the trial.

391
00:21:55,054 --> 00:21:56,044
Commander!

392
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:57,318
We'll find that out soon enough.

393
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,760
If they were in the runabout

394
00:21:58,796 --> 00:22:00,527
how did the Cardassians
find out?

395
00:22:00,566 --> 00:22:03,299
That's the one question
I want an answer to.

396
00:22:03,339 --> 00:22:06,209
I also want to find out
who the other guy was.

397
00:22:06,246 --> 00:22:07,647
The other guy?

398
00:22:07,681 --> 00:22:10,380
The one who was waiting
to receive these warheads.

399
00:22:10,421 --> 00:22:12,654
I'll have Starfleet Intelligence

400
00:22:12,692 --> 00:22:14,753
begin to pick up Maquis suspects
for questioning.

401
00:22:14,797 --> 00:22:16,893
In the meantime,
let's see if we can ID

402
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,336
any possible Maquis members

403
00:22:18,372 --> 00:22:20,342
who have been
on the station recently.

404
00:22:20,377 --> 00:22:22,142
Dismissed.

405
00:22:33,338 --> 00:22:36,334
Tell me you're here
to take me home.

406
00:22:36,378 --> 00:22:38,314
I'm sorry.

407
00:22:42,191 --> 00:22:43,956
How have they treated you?

408
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:47,533
Not so bad.

409
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:49,665
They did some dental
work when I got here

410
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,405
that wasn't much fun.

411
00:22:51,445 --> 00:22:53,176
All Cardassians are required

412
00:22:53,215 --> 00:22:54,980
to give the Bureau
of Identification

413
00:22:55,052 --> 00:22:56,544
one of their first molars.

414
00:22:56,589 --> 00:22:59,322
It's usually extracted
at age ten.

415
00:23:01,032 --> 00:23:03,469
Keiko... is she all right?

416
00:23:03,504 --> 00:23:05,702
She came with me.

417
00:23:05,743 --> 00:23:07,474
She's here? Now?

418
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:10,680
It's not permitted
for family members

419
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,784
to visit offenders
in confinement.

420
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:17,323
She'll be at the trial tomorrow.

421
00:23:17,368 --> 00:23:20,739
The Cardassians
always invite families

422
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:22,974
to trials and executions

423
00:23:23,014 --> 00:23:25,987
so that the public
can see them weep.

424
00:23:26,054 --> 00:23:27,683
No.

425
00:23:27,724 --> 00:23:29,523
I don't want her there.

426
00:23:29,561 --> 00:23:32,089
I don't want her
to see me like this.

427
00:23:32,134 --> 00:23:34,697
I think that's a mistake.

428
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,973
My lawyer has already told me.

429
00:23:37,011 --> 00:23:39,380
It's all over but the execution.

430
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:42,389
I... I don't even know
what I'm charged with!

431
00:23:42,423 --> 00:23:44,450
Did they tell you anything?

432
00:23:44,494 --> 00:23:47,763
No... but we have an idea.

433
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,897
What?

434
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,471
Have you ever had
any dealings with the Maquis?

435
00:23:53,514 --> 00:23:54,813
Dealings?

436
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:56,844
No. I'm not sure
what you mean.

437
00:23:56,888 --> 00:23:59,052
Do you know anybody
in the Maquis?

438
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,629
No.

439
00:24:00,663 --> 00:24:03,191
Ever supplied
any of them with weapons?

440
00:24:03,236 --> 00:24:04,705
No!

441
00:24:04,739 --> 00:24:07,506
Are you here
to interrogate me, Constable?

442
00:24:07,545 --> 00:24:11,007
Is anyone ever going to tell me
what I'm supposed to have done?

443
00:24:11,052 --> 00:24:13,991
Commander Sisko informed me
a few hours ago

444
00:24:14,026 --> 00:24:17,397
that 24 photon warheads
are missing from the station.

445
00:24:17,433 --> 00:24:21,168
We believe they may have been
in your runabout's cargo bay

446
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:23,041
intended for the Maquis.

447
00:24:24,582 --> 00:24:26,883
The Cardassians did find
something in the hold.

448
00:24:26,921 --> 00:24:27,889
That's true.

449
00:24:27,923 --> 00:24:29,449
But you know nothing about it?

450
00:24:29,493 --> 00:24:30,962
Nothing.

451
00:24:30,996 --> 00:24:33,490
And you didn't transport them
from Weapons Locker 4

452
00:24:33,535 --> 00:24:35,027
just before you left
the station?

453
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,871
No.

454
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:39,437
Were you in Weapons Locker 4
before you left the station?

455
00:24:39,481 --> 00:24:40,642
No.

456
00:24:40,685 --> 00:24:42,518
Then why does the log
say that you were?

457
00:24:42,555 --> 00:24:46,086
Why was it your voice
releasing the security lock?

458
00:24:46,163 --> 00:24:47,792
My voice?

459
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:49,496
Your voice.

460
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:55,004
I don't know.

461
00:24:56,786 --> 00:25:00,955
You don't know me very well,
Constable, but I... I...

462
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:07,072
I've been in service
to the Federation... Starfleet...

463
00:25:07,142 --> 00:25:08,771
all my adult life.

464
00:25:08,812 --> 00:25:12,047
No one has ever questioned
my loyalty.

465
00:25:12,086 --> 00:25:16,289
No one in my entire life
has ever had cause to ask

466
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:19,769
"Miles O'Brien,
are you a criminal?"

467
00:25:21,508 --> 00:25:23,501
I took an oath...

468
00:25:23,545 --> 00:25:27,646
to defend the Federation
and what it stands for.

469
00:25:27,688 --> 00:25:29,749
I don't steal from them.

470
00:25:29,793 --> 00:25:31,422
I don't lie to them.

471
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:34,959
I'm no angel,
but I try to live every day

472
00:25:35,004 --> 00:25:38,341
as the best human being
I know how to be.

473
00:25:38,378 --> 00:25:41,783
I need my little girl
to wake up in the morning

474
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:45,224
and look up at me
and see a man she can respect.

475
00:25:46,896 --> 00:25:49,060
Until now, she always could.

476
00:25:52,909 --> 00:25:57,750
Being accused of a crime
is not a disgrace, Chief.

477
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:02,058
Some of the great figures
of history

478
00:26:02,096 --> 00:26:04,157
have shared the honor with you.

479
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:09,535
I didn't figure
on dying a martyr.

480
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,693
Not all of them were martyrs.

481
00:26:15,727 --> 00:26:17,663
Not all of them died.

482
00:26:17,697 --> 00:26:20,693
Some of them were
just innocent men

483
00:26:20,738 --> 00:26:22,401
like you.

484
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:30,551
Now, I've managed to get myself
named to your defense team.

485
00:26:30,592 --> 00:26:32,186
I'll be there tomorrow.

486
00:26:32,262 --> 00:26:33,925
Your wife will be there,
as well

487
00:26:33,966 --> 00:26:37,064
but she won't be weeping,
and neither will you.

488
00:26:37,107 --> 00:26:38,940
I want the Archon to see

489
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:41,973
the clear, unwavering eyes
of an innocent man.

490
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,919
Is that understood?

491
00:26:43,955 --> 00:26:45,788
Yes, sir.

492
00:26:45,826 --> 00:26:47,659
Guard!

493
00:26:50,302 --> 00:26:52,238
I'll see you tomorrow.

494
00:26:52,306 --> 00:26:53,866
Odo...

495
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:56,404
thanks for being here.

496
00:27:09,444 --> 00:27:11,070
The voice modulation patterns
don't match up.

497
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,596
The voice modulation patterns
don't match up.

498
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,941
See how the peaks here
and here are out of phase?

499
00:27:14,979 --> 00:27:16,744
So, we can prove
it wasn't O'Brien

500
00:27:16,849 --> 00:27:18,478
who entered the weapons locker.

501
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,581
It's O'Brien's voice,
but the sentence

502
00:27:20,624 --> 00:27:22,389
was reconstructed
sound by sound.

503
00:27:23,631 --> 00:27:24,724
I've got our Maquis.

504
00:27:24,766 --> 00:27:26,565
I narrowed the suspects down

505
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:29,235
to 12 people who live
in the Demilitarized Zone

506
00:27:29,277 --> 00:27:31,076
and were on the station
that day.

507
00:27:31,114 --> 00:27:32,879
Raymond Boone, human.
Lives on Volon III.

508
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:33,943
Three merchants
on the Promenade

509
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,956
saw him talking to O'Brien
just before he left.

510
00:27:35,991 --> 00:27:38,326
Talking to him and recording
his voice perhaps?

511
00:27:38,363 --> 00:27:39,331
Recording?

512
00:27:39,365 --> 00:27:41,996
Someone doctored
Chief O'Brien's voice

513
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:43,473
to get
into the weapons locker.

514
00:27:43,508 --> 00:27:46,879
I'll have him picked up.

515
00:27:48,285 --> 00:27:50,950
The offender,
Miles O'Brien, human

516
00:27:50,991 --> 00:27:53,827
officer of
the Federation Starfleet

517
00:27:53,863 --> 00:27:55,457
has been found guilty

518
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,835
of aiding and abetting
seditious acts

519
00:27:57,872 --> 00:28:00,537
against the state.

520
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,047
The sentence is death.

521
00:28:02,082 --> 00:28:03,415
Let the trial begin.

522
00:28:05,456 --> 00:28:07,791
Conservator Kovat,
is the offender

523
00:28:07,861 --> 00:28:09,797
ready to face his judgment?

524
00:28:09,865 --> 00:28:11,425
He is, Madam Archon.

525
00:28:11,469 --> 00:28:12,733
Let him enter.

526
00:28:30,411 --> 00:28:31,937
Mr. O'Brien

527
00:28:31,981 --> 00:28:35,113
you can spare your family
and the Federation

528
00:28:35,155 --> 00:28:38,651
further humiliation by
dispensing with this proceeding

529
00:28:38,696 --> 00:28:40,359
and confessing now.

530
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,335
No, thanks.

531
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,671
Very well.

532
00:28:44,709 --> 00:28:47,374
The Nestor
and Mrs. O'Brien may enter.

533
00:28:51,825 --> 00:28:53,590
Mrs. O'Brien

534
00:28:53,628 --> 00:28:56,065
this court recognizes
the disgrace

535
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,436
your husband has brought to you.

536
00:28:58,473 --> 00:29:01,537
As is prescribed in
the Cardassian Articles

537
00:29:01,579 --> 00:29:04,244
of Jurisprudence,
we hereby offer you

538
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:07,850
the opportunity to disassociate
yourself from his actions

539
00:29:07,926 --> 00:29:09,691
by testifying against him.

540
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:11,359
I have no intention

541
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:14,533
of testifying
against my husband.

542
00:29:16,245 --> 00:29:18,512
Call the first witness.

543
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,853
Madam Archon,
may I confer privately

544
00:29:21,891 --> 00:29:23,987
with the Conservator
before we begin?

545
00:29:25,298 --> 00:29:27,895
I believe
that this is the first time

546
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:31,535
you are serving as nestor,
so perhaps I should explain

547
00:29:31,578 --> 00:29:34,813
that you have no authority
to address this court.

548
00:29:34,852 --> 00:29:37,517
You assist the defendant,
that is all.

549
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,757
I beg the court's indulgence.
I am new at this.

550
00:29:39,796 --> 00:29:43,201
All of Cardassia is watching
these proceedings.

551
00:29:43,237 --> 00:29:45,606
Private conferences
do not make for good viewing.

552
00:29:45,642 --> 00:29:48,945
You should have done this
before we convened.

553
00:29:48,983 --> 00:29:51,853
Very well.
Make it quick.

554
00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:55,821
Please don't ruin this for me.

555
00:29:55,865 --> 00:29:58,268
I'm only a year away
from retirement.

556
00:29:58,303 --> 00:30:01,765
We have new evidence
to prove O'Brien's innocence.

557
00:30:01,812 --> 00:30:03,111
New evidence?

558
00:30:03,147 --> 00:30:04,810
If O'Brien is accused
of stealing warheads

559
00:30:04,851 --> 00:30:06,981
from Deep Space 9, we can
prove that he didn't do it.

560
00:30:07,023 --> 00:30:08,218
Of course he did it.

561
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:09,853
He's been found guilty,
hasn't he?

562
00:30:09,896 --> 00:30:11,456
Someone manipulated
a recording

563
00:30:11,499 --> 00:30:12,866
of his voice to gain entry.

564
00:30:12,903 --> 00:30:15,136
I can produce
that recording here.

565
00:30:15,174 --> 00:30:17,144
No evidence can be submitted

566
00:30:17,178 --> 00:30:18,977
after the verdict
has been reached.

567
00:30:19,016 --> 00:30:20,143
You should know that.

568
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,816
Of course, but I was
hoping that the most

569
00:30:22,858 --> 00:30:25,659
renowned conservator
in all of Cardassia...

570
00:30:25,697 --> 00:30:27,827
You flatter me, sir,
you flatter me.

571
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:29,668
But we want justice

572
00:30:29,706 --> 00:30:32,007
not chaos in this court.

573
00:30:32,045 --> 00:30:34,676
No, I will have
no part of this.

574
00:30:34,717 --> 00:30:36,243
Enough!

575
00:30:36,287 --> 00:30:38,622
Are you ready to proceed,
Conservator?

576
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:39,752
I am.

577
00:30:39,795 --> 00:30:41,389
Madam Archon,
may I address the court?

578
00:30:41,432 --> 00:30:43,733
Didn't I just explain to you
that you may not?

579
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:45,069
But if our Conservator

580
00:30:45,106 --> 00:30:47,076
refuses to bring up
new evidence...

581
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:47,838
Silence!

582
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:48,847
...of a manipulated

583
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:50,076
recording
of the offender's voice

584
00:30:50,117 --> 00:30:51,346
that would prove
his innocence...

585
00:30:51,387 --> 00:30:53,084
You are out of order, sir!

586
00:30:53,191 --> 00:30:54,820
What else am I
supposed to do?

587
00:30:54,861 --> 00:30:58,494
You are supposed to respect
our judicial procedures.

588
00:30:58,536 --> 00:31:01,532
Wouldn't you ask
that we respect your rules

589
00:31:01,576 --> 00:31:02,909
if we were in your court?

590
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:04,882
Which raises my next point,
Madam Archon.

591
00:31:04,916 --> 00:31:07,581
I would like to move for
a change of venue to my court.

592
00:31:07,622 --> 00:31:10,789
No crime has been committed
against Cardassia.

593
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:13,699
It was, in fact, committed
at a Bajoran space station.

594
00:31:13,736 --> 00:31:16,173
Madam Archon,
I am extremely humiliated.

595
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,645
I ask to be relieved
of this assignment.

596
00:31:18,681 --> 00:31:19,649
No!

597
00:31:19,683 --> 00:31:20,912
Sit down!

598
00:31:25,595 --> 00:31:27,189
And you, sir...

599
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:30,637
do not try the patience
of the Cardassian people.

600
00:31:30,673 --> 00:31:33,236
If this court finds you
in contempt

601
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,684
you will find the punishment
very unpleasant.

602
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,659
I regret that I have no teeth

603
00:31:39,693 --> 00:31:42,962
to offer your Bureau
of Identification.

604
00:31:45,171 --> 00:31:49,078
As for new evidence, yes,
I fully expected the Federation

605
00:31:49,114 --> 00:31:51,711
to come up with
remarkable new evidence

606
00:31:51,753 --> 00:31:54,054
in an attempt
to free Mr. O'Brien.

607
00:31:54,091 --> 00:31:55,685
I am sure your experts

608
00:31:55,728 --> 00:31:58,131
can create
all sorts of evidence

609
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:00,160
to confuse the issues.

610
00:32:00,272 --> 00:32:04,111
That may work in your courts,
but not here.

611
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:07,584
There will be no new
evidence considered.

612
00:32:10,294 --> 00:32:12,287
Call the first witness!

613
00:32:15,972 --> 00:32:18,136
Look, we're not
after the Maquis.

614
00:32:18,211 --> 00:32:20,113
We're just trying
to help an innocent man.

615
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:21,879
And I'm telling you.
I don't have

616
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,787
any idea
what you're talking about.

617
00:32:23,824 --> 00:32:26,022
People saw you
talking to O'Brien

618
00:32:26,061 --> 00:32:27,462
just before he left.

619
00:32:27,498 --> 00:32:29,331
Well, since when is
that a crime?

620
00:32:29,368 --> 00:32:31,805
We're old friends
from the <i>Rutledge.</i>

621
00:32:31,841 --> 00:32:32,809
Doesn't it bother you

622
00:32:32,844 --> 00:32:34,677
that an old friend is
about to be executed

623
00:32:34,714 --> 00:32:35,978
by the Cardassians?

624
00:32:36,016 --> 00:32:37,485
Of course, it does.

625
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,513
I wish there was something
I could do to help.

626
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:42,656
He has a wife
and a five-year-old daughter.

627
00:32:42,698 --> 00:32:45,295
If you're worried
we'll turn you over

628
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:49,039
to the Cardassians,
I can assure you that we won't.

629
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:51,106
Well, I haven't done anything.

630
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,849
I don't have anything
to be worried about.

631
00:32:56,328 --> 00:32:58,822
Hold him
for further questioning.

632
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:12,853
Computer, lights.

633
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:29,757
Don't turn around, Doctor.

634
00:33:29,802 --> 00:33:32,035
There's nothing here
you could want.

635
00:33:32,074 --> 00:33:33,737
You have a man in custody

636
00:33:33,777 --> 00:33:36,248
suspected
of arranging the theft

637
00:33:36,316 --> 00:33:39,083
of photon warheads...
Raymond Boone.

638
00:33:39,122 --> 00:33:40,557
That's right.

639
00:33:40,592 --> 00:33:43,223
I'm here to tell you
he is not one of us.

640
00:33:43,264 --> 00:33:44,733
"Not one of us"?

641
00:33:44,768 --> 00:33:47,262
You're from the Maquis.

642
00:33:47,307 --> 00:33:49,403
That's correct.

643
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,004
Why should I believe you?

644
00:33:51,048 --> 00:33:53,713
We knew nothing
about the theft

645
00:33:53,755 --> 00:33:56,283
and this man is not one of us.

646
00:33:56,394 --> 00:33:58,695
And that's all I can tell you.

647
00:33:58,732 --> 00:34:02,696
How do I know you're not
just trying to protect him?

648
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,710
Who else would want photon...

649
00:34:04,745 --> 00:34:06,578
warheads?

650
00:34:09,142 --> 00:34:12,081
The Maquis are savage,
Federation-born killers!

651
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:16,455
They live to terrorize
and murder innocent Cardassians

652
00:34:16,492 --> 00:34:20,227
as evidenced by these weapons we
confiscated from O'Brien's ship.

653
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:24,800
These Maquis are based
in the Demilitarized Zone?

654
00:34:24,877 --> 00:34:27,508
They are all
from Federation settlements

655
00:34:27,549 --> 00:34:30,043
inside Cardassian
occupied territory.

656
00:34:30,088 --> 00:34:33,550
Frankly, the situation
is becoming untenable.

657
00:34:33,596 --> 00:34:36,569
How many more innocent
people must die

658
00:34:36,603 --> 00:34:39,336
before the situation
becomes clear?

659
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:41,846
How do you know
these photon warheads

660
00:34:41,881 --> 00:34:44,284
recovered from
the offender's vessel

661
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,521
were intended for the Maquis?

662
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,399
According to reliable sources,
the Maquis arranged the theft.

663
00:34:51,436 --> 00:34:52,871
I object!

664
00:34:52,939 --> 00:34:55,638
Madam Archon, please!

665
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:58,742
I thought we went over this
yesterday, Mr. Odo.

666
00:34:58,785 --> 00:35:00,812
What is it this time?

667
00:35:00,856 --> 00:35:03,657
Gul Evek has tied the Maquis
to this plot

668
00:35:03,695 --> 00:35:05,825
by quoting reliable sources.

669
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:10,809
I think we deserve to know
who these reliable sources are.

670
00:35:10,845 --> 00:35:12,508
Can you provide
any details, Gul Evek?

671
00:35:12,548 --> 00:35:14,712
I am afraid that information
cannot be revealed

672
00:35:14,754 --> 00:35:17,021
without risk to national
security, Madam Archon.

673
00:35:17,058 --> 00:35:18,618
That's an acceptable answer.

674
00:35:18,661 --> 00:35:20,563
Might we know how Gul Evek

675
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,265
learned the warheads
were in the runabout?

676
00:35:23,305 --> 00:35:24,831
Yes, of course.

677
00:35:24,876 --> 00:35:27,507
We learned about them
from reliable sources.

678
00:35:27,548 --> 00:35:30,213
Are you satisfied, Nestor?

679
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:31,985
Madam Archon...

680
00:35:32,024 --> 00:35:34,894
Enough! This is already
the longest trial

681
00:35:34,964 --> 00:35:37,299
in the history of Cardassia.

682
00:35:37,336 --> 00:35:40,309
Let's try to speed things up,
shall we?

683
00:35:41,946 --> 00:35:44,076
Proceed, Mr. Kovat.

684
00:35:44,118 --> 00:35:47,091
As you wish, Madam Archon.

685
00:35:47,124 --> 00:35:50,655
I'll try to be
as brief as possible.

686
00:35:55,142 --> 00:35:56,110
What is this?

687
00:35:56,144 --> 00:35:57,545
I'd like Dr. Bashir
to give you

688
00:35:57,581 --> 00:35:58,606
a physical examination.

689
00:35:58,649 --> 00:35:59,844
What for?

690
00:35:59,886 --> 00:36:02,187
To help us answer
some questions about you.

691
00:36:02,225 --> 00:36:03,592
What are you talking about?

692
00:36:03,627 --> 00:36:05,894
For example,
why you haven't spoken

693
00:36:05,932 --> 00:36:07,902
to your parents
in eight years.

694
00:36:07,936 --> 00:36:09,997
What's that got to do
with anything?

695
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:11,533
I never got along with them.

696
00:36:11,578 --> 00:36:13,571
That's not what they told us.

697
00:36:13,616 --> 00:36:16,247
You left your wife
about eight years ago.

698
00:36:16,288 --> 00:36:18,315
You'd been married
a long time...

699
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,659
almost 15 years, wasn't it?

700
00:36:19,695 --> 00:36:22,098
Look, this is none
of your business.

701
00:36:22,134 --> 00:36:23,603
And about the same time

702
00:36:23,638 --> 00:36:25,939
you were discharged
from Starfleet

703
00:36:26,043 --> 00:36:28,207
after failing several crew
performance reviews.

704
00:36:28,248 --> 00:36:32,280
All of this seemed to happen
shortly after Setlik III.

705
00:36:34,662 --> 00:36:36,655
Bring him over here.

706
00:36:39,706 --> 00:36:42,177
Some romantic vacation
I took you on, huh?

707
00:36:42,212 --> 00:36:45,276
We'll have other chances.

708
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:48,223
Keiko, I don't want you
to be there next week.

709
00:36:48,259 --> 00:36:49,728
It isn't over yet.

710
00:36:49,762 --> 00:36:51,858
Don't give them
the satisfaction.

711
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,095
Miles, you can't just...

712
00:36:53,136 --> 00:36:54,365
I mean it.

713
00:37:12,011 --> 00:37:14,004
Court will resume.

714
00:37:15,418 --> 00:37:18,880
The offender will
step forward and testify.

715
00:37:18,925 --> 00:37:21,761
I have nothing
to say to this court.

716
00:37:21,799 --> 00:37:25,000
Under Cardassian law,
you are compelled to testify.

717
00:37:25,073 --> 00:37:26,565
Step forward.

718
00:37:32,389 --> 00:37:36,160
This would be a good time
to advise the offender.

719
00:37:36,197 --> 00:37:38,293
Advise him to do what?

720
00:37:38,336 --> 00:37:39,862
To confess.

721
00:37:39,906 --> 00:37:42,673
To throw himself on the mercy
of the court, of course.

722
00:37:42,712 --> 00:37:46,585
I never heard of a Cardassian
court showing mercy.

723
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:50,321
That is not the point.

724
00:37:50,362 --> 00:37:54,998
Think of the children, sir.

725
00:37:55,039 --> 00:38:00,381
Allow them to see
a glimmer of enlightenment.

726
00:38:00,417 --> 00:38:03,390
As the offender realizes

727
00:38:03,424 --> 00:38:06,021
that the end is near

728
00:38:06,063 --> 00:38:11,565
let him use his last breath
to show remorse.

729
00:38:11,609 --> 00:38:13,602
Do you wish
to advise the offender

730
00:38:13,646 --> 00:38:15,206
at this time, Nestor?

731
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,351
No, Madam Archon.

732
00:38:19,592 --> 00:38:21,927
Very well.
Proceed, Mr. Kovat.

733
00:38:28,111 --> 00:38:33,579
Mr. O'Brien,
were you abused as a child?

734
00:38:33,623 --> 00:38:34,591
What?

735
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:38,190
Were your parents
especially abusive?

736
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:41,035
Did you hate them very much?

737
00:38:41,073 --> 00:38:43,772
I loved my parents.

738
00:38:43,812 --> 00:38:46,147
I see.

739
00:38:51,597 --> 00:38:53,590
Spousal abuse, perhaps?

740
00:38:53,634 --> 00:38:58,634
Was your wife causing you
severe psychological stress?

741
00:38:58,678 --> 00:39:00,375
My wife is the most wonderful

742
00:39:00,415 --> 00:39:02,351
supportive person
I've ever known.

743
00:39:02,386 --> 00:39:03,878
Excuse me for asking.

744
00:39:03,923 --> 00:39:06,087
I'm merely trying to establish

745
00:39:06,128 --> 00:39:09,761
why a fine man like you
could turn into a criminal.

746
00:39:09,802 --> 00:39:12,535
Now, perhaps you could help me.

747
00:39:12,576 --> 00:39:15,343
Sorry, no, I can't help,
because I'm no criminal.

748
00:39:17,152 --> 00:39:18,781
Well...

749
00:39:18,822 --> 00:39:20,485
I tried.

750
00:39:21,996 --> 00:39:24,023
Tell me, Mr. O'Brien

751
00:39:24,067 --> 00:39:26,664
how many Cardassians
have you killed?

752
00:39:26,707 --> 00:39:28,142
Killed?

753
00:39:28,176 --> 00:39:29,645
None.

754
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,741
Since the war, that is.

755
00:39:31,785 --> 00:39:33,516
Including the war

756
00:39:33,555 --> 00:39:37,326
how many Cardassians
have you killed?

757
00:39:37,363 --> 00:39:39,596
Madam Archon, what relevance

758
00:39:39,635 --> 00:39:42,836
does Mr. O'Brien's
war experiences have?

759
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:44,845
His past criminal record

760
00:39:44,879 --> 00:39:48,011
is very much relevant
to these proceedings, sir.

761
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:50,183
Answer the question.

762
00:39:50,292 --> 00:39:53,128
I'm not sure.

763
00:39:53,164 --> 00:39:54,758
That many, eh?

764
00:39:54,801 --> 00:39:56,065
It was war.

765
00:39:56,105 --> 00:39:58,201
Both sides did things
they had to do.

766
00:39:58,275 --> 00:40:02,216
Tell me, Mr. O'Brien,
now that we are at peace

767
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:05,587
do you have a warm place
in your heart

768
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:07,595
for your Cardassian
neighbors

769
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:12,596
or are you deeply prejudiced
against Cardassians?

770
00:40:12,641 --> 00:40:15,442
Do you not, in fact,
hate Cardassians?

771
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,917
Have you not
on several occasions

772
00:40:17,952 --> 00:40:21,255
publicly stated
your opposition to the treaty

773
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,262
because, and I quote

774
00:40:23,331 --> 00:40:26,862
"The bloody Cardies
can't be trusted"?

775
00:40:26,906 --> 00:40:28,933
I decline to answer that.

776
00:40:28,976 --> 00:40:30,002
There are no grounds

777
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,334
in Cardassian law
which permit you to decline.

778
00:40:32,374 --> 00:40:33,399
Answer the question.

779
00:40:33,444 --> 00:40:37,886
Is it an accurate quote or not?

780
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,187
It is.

781
00:40:40,225 --> 00:40:42,662
Madam Archon, at this time

782
00:40:42,697 --> 00:40:47,367
it seems the offender's guilt
has been clearly established

783
00:40:47,407 --> 00:40:51,974
and I see no other alternative
but to concede the verdict.

784
00:40:52,084 --> 00:40:53,279
I do not concede!

785
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,755
You may stand down, Mr. O'Brien.

786
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:56,851
I am not guilty!

787
00:40:56,895 --> 00:40:58,626
I've committed no crime

788
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:01,193
and I do not concede
to this court

789
00:41:01,238 --> 00:41:03,299
or the Cardassian Empire!

790
00:41:03,342 --> 00:41:04,936
Madam Archon, I apologize

791
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:07,916
but I appear to have lost
control of my client.

792
00:41:07,952 --> 00:41:09,421
No matter.

793
00:41:09,456 --> 00:41:13,397
You've done your usual
eloquent job on his behalf

794
00:41:13,431 --> 00:41:15,128
Conservator Kovat.

795
00:41:15,169 --> 00:41:16,832
Thank you, Madam Archon.

796
00:41:16,872 --> 00:41:19,173
This has been
a most difficult case

797
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,274
but it is always an honor
to serve your court.

798
00:41:30,735 --> 00:41:31,999
I object to this.

799
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:33,598
Madam Archon

800
00:41:33,642 --> 00:41:37,343
how can you continue
to tolerate these intrusions?

801
00:41:37,383 --> 00:41:40,481
Return to your seat.

802
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:51,574
Once again, the Cardassian
System of Jurisprudence

803
00:41:51,615 --> 00:41:54,018
has worked
to protect its people.

804
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:57,858
A guilty man
has been brought to justice.

805
00:41:57,895 --> 00:42:00,366
But never let it be said

806
00:42:00,401 --> 00:42:05,504
that there is no room
in this system for compassion.

807
00:42:05,545 --> 00:42:10,579
I sense in Mr. O'Brien...
a man with strong family ties...

808
00:42:10,623 --> 00:42:13,892
the potential
for rehabilitation.

809
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:16,128
And I'm sure
that he has gained

810
00:42:16,169 --> 00:42:18,640
a new appreciation
of Cardassian law

811
00:42:18,675 --> 00:42:20,908
through this difficult process.

812
00:42:20,945 --> 00:42:22,642
Therefore, I am pleased

813
00:42:22,684 --> 00:42:27,058
in the spirit of furthering
Cardassian-Federation relations

814
00:42:27,093 --> 00:42:31,398
to hereby set aside the verdict
and to release Mr. O'Brien

815
00:42:31,436 --> 00:42:33,771
into the custody
of his Commander

816
00:42:33,808 --> 00:42:35,641
Benjamin Sisko.

817
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:45,299
What happened?

818
00:42:45,333 --> 00:42:46,301
What...

819
00:42:46,335 --> 00:42:47,462
You won.

820
00:42:47,504 --> 00:42:48,939
I...

821
00:42:53,117 --> 00:42:55,315
They'll kill me.

822
00:43:01,402 --> 00:43:03,600
Then the Maquis
told you about Boone.

823
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,736
When Doctor Bashir
examined him

824
00:43:05,778 --> 00:43:09,081
he discovered that Boone
was missing his first molar.

825
00:43:09,118 --> 00:43:12,285
The DNA analysis confirmed
that he was Cardassian.

826
00:43:12,325 --> 00:43:14,295
He was surgically altered?

827
00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:16,698
Eight years ago, to replace
the real Raymond Boone

828
00:43:16,735 --> 00:43:18,671
who was taken prisoner
at Setlik III

829
00:43:18,706 --> 00:43:20,973
and apparently
killed in detention.

830
00:43:21,011 --> 00:43:22,640
Well, how did you figure it out?

831
00:43:22,681 --> 00:43:24,207
His ex-wife told us

832
00:43:24,251 --> 00:43:26,779
he came back from captivity
a different man.

833
00:43:26,824 --> 00:43:29,261
She blamed it
on the treatment he received

834
00:43:29,296 --> 00:43:32,360
from the Cardassians,
but it started us to thinking.

835
00:43:32,403 --> 00:43:34,670
So, he was spying
for the Cardassians

836
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:37,339
even when he was serving
on the <i>Rutledge</i> with me?

837
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,510
But why would they
want to frame Miles?

838
00:43:39,552 --> 00:43:41,249
This trial was never

839
00:43:41,289 --> 00:43:43,487
about your husband,
Mrs. O'Brien.

840
00:43:43,527 --> 00:43:44,928
It was designed
from the beginning

841
00:43:44,964 --> 00:43:46,159
to discredit the Federation...

842
00:43:46,234 --> 00:43:48,797
to show that the Maquis
had their official sanction.

843
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:51,003
Gul Evek's testimony
made it clear

844
00:43:51,043 --> 00:43:53,674
that the situation
had become untenable.

845
00:43:53,717 --> 00:43:55,414
Next, they would
have been demanding

846
00:43:55,454 --> 00:43:57,515
that the Federation
colonies be disbanded.

847
00:43:57,558 --> 00:43:59,027
Exactly.

848
00:43:59,061 --> 00:44:01,362
When Makbar saw Boone
in the courtroom

849
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,031
she realized that we had
the goods to embarrass

850
00:44:04,072 --> 00:44:06,805
the High Command
in front of the entire populace.

851
00:44:06,845 --> 00:44:09,043
Oh, I'm just glad
it's all over.

852
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:11,144
I'm ready to get back
to work.

853
00:44:11,222 --> 00:44:13,158
Oh, no, no, no.

854
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,322
I had to use
all of my influence

855
00:44:15,364 --> 00:44:18,360
to extend your accommodations
at the lagoon.

856
00:44:18,404 --> 00:44:21,035
We'll drop you off
on our way home.

857
00:44:21,076 --> 00:44:23,547
But we haven't any bags,
no holo-cam.

858
00:44:23,582 --> 00:44:25,883
I've nothing to read.

859
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,412
Perfect.
