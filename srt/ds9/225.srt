1
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:06,757
And I've downloaded

2
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:08,592
the new docking procedure
checklist for Bay 6

3
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:10,051
into the Bay-Prod D-9 file.

4
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:12,721
That's the only bay
using the new criteria.

5
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,181
Got it.

6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,850
And be sure to monitor
the power fluctuations

7
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,726
in the secondary
fusion core.

8
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:20,395
It's got some little kinks in
there I don't like the look of.

9
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,105
I will care for the
secondary fusion core

10
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,524
like it was
my own child.

11
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,192
As soon as I get back,
I'm going to run

12
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,277
a full diagnostic,
to make sure there's no...

13
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,779
Chief! We are
perfectly capable

14
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,656
of running this place
by ourselves for a week.

15
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:31,907
Well, if you have
any problems

16
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,492
you can reach me
on subspace...

17
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:36,745
Would you please go on vacation
and get out of our hair?

18
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,084
Miles.
Yeah?

19
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,337
Have a good time.

20
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,255
Oh, right.

21
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:48,716
Thanks, yeah.

22
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:50,384
I feel relaxed already.

23
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,263
Is he gone?

24
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,057
KIRA:
Finally.

25
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,976
Good. He's been driving me
crazy all day.

26
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,394
You'd think that I was...

27
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,812
O'BRIEN:
Commander...

28
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:02,855
I forgot to tell you.

29
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:04,398
I added a new sub-routine

30
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,066
to the environmental control
in the Habitat Ring...

31
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,317
Chief O'Brien.

32
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,694
Yes, sir?

33
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:10,320
You're on leave.

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,239
Please disembark this station.

35
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,199
Aye, sir.

36
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,251
It's okay.

37
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:29,548
Boone!

38
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,466
O'Brien.
Miles O'Brien.

39
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,718
We served together
on the<i> Rutledge.</i>

40
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:34,093
Of course! O'Brien.

41
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,930
Oh, it's been a long time.

42
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,264
How are you doing?

43
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,682
I'm fine, just fine.

44
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:41,268
I work on this station now.
Chief Engineer.

45
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,519
Is that a fact?

46
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,145
Yeah. How long you been
out of Starfleet?

47
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,981
Oh, about eight years now.
I settled on Volon III.

48
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,691
Well, that's
on the Cardassian side

49
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,651
of the Demilitarized Zone,
isn't it?

50
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,446
Yes. Well, the new treaty, it
really puts us in harm's way.

51
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,031
But I run a ladarium
mining sluice

52
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,199
so as long as the Cardassians
need ladarium

53
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,410
for their warp drives,
they leave me alone.

54
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,246
Well, after what we went
through in the border wars

55
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,415
I don't know
how you can live there.

56
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,250
You were there at Setlik III.

57
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,877
That's what got me
out of Starfleet.

58
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,755
Really?
That's why I stayed in.

59
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,548
Listen, my wife
is waiting for me

60
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,300
and she hates it when I'm late,
and I always am.

61
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,760
I'm coming back

62
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,261
for another supply pickup
in a month or two.

63
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,763
Okay, let me know when.

64
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,156
(<i> static</i> )

65
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,199
O'BRIEN:
O'Brien, Miles O'Brien.

66
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,368
We served together
on the<i> Rutledge.</i>

67
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,034
KEIKO:
Miles?
Uh-huh?

68
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,536
Didn't you bring
the holo-cam?

69
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,371
Was I supposed to?

70
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,998
You said you
were going to.

71
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,126
Did I?

72
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:55,754
Last night, when we were
going over the list in bed.

73
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,380
Not me.

74
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,467
I was dead as soon as my head
hit the pillow.

75
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,303
You talked to me
for half an hour.

76
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,890
No, there must have been
someone else in bed with us.

77
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,646
What's this?

78
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,398
Oh, just some new
technical update manuals.

79
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,734
Our first vacation
in five years

80
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,737
and you brought
technical update manuals?

81
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,865
You know, maybe we should
have brought Molly with us.

82
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,785
Do you think she'll be okay
with the Petersons?

83
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:30,080
She likes the Petersons
more than she likes us.

84
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,623
She's fine.

85
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,458
We could swing back

86
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,919
pick up the holo-cam
<i>and</i> Molly

87
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,505
and still only lose
about half a day.

88
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,465
Or we could pick up
the holo-cam

89
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,884
when we get there.

90
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,179
How many did you bring?

91
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,805
What?

92
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,975
Tech update manuals?

93
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,685
Just a few.

94
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:03,989
Computer, play something
by... Minezaki.

95
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:07,492
(<i> koto playing melody</i> )

96
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,543
(<i> flute joins in</i> )

97
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,800
(<i> sighs</i> )

98
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,817
(<i> laughing</i> )

99
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,824
Do these chairs recline?

100
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,993
I wish they did.

101
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,662
You're an engineer.
Do something about it.

102
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,373
I'll make it
worth your while.

103
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:56,291
Ohh...mmm...

104
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,667
COMPUTER:
Vessel approaching.

105
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:01,004
Bearing 191 mark 6.

106
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,464
Identify.

107
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,466
Cardassian patrol ship,
Hideki-class.

108
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,303
Shields up!

109
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:19,564
Try to send an emergency
subspace signal to the station.

110
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,358
I... I can't.

111
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,402
They're jamming all
subspace frequencies.

112
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:24,485
They're hailing us.

113
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,282
This is Miles O'Brien

114
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,242
of Starbase
Deep Space 9.

115
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:31,618
State your business.

116
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,412
Mr. O'Brien,
we've spoken before.

117
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:34,871
My name is Evek.

118
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,457
Shut down your drive,
and come to a full stop.

119
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,918
We're beaming
an inspection team aboard.

120
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,753
We're nowhere near
the Cardassian border.

121
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,422
You've no authority here.

122
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,382
We'll argue
about authority later.

123
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,841
For now,
you will either comply

124
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,468
or we will take
preemptive action.

125
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,304
COMPUTER:
Warning.

126
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:53,014
Sensors are reading
photo lock-on activation.

127
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,766
You have ten seconds.

128
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,438
Don't worry.

129
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,231
We haven't done anything.

130
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,318
Thank you
for your cooperation.

131
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,153
I have orders to arrest you,
Mr. O'Brien.

132
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,279
KEIKO:
Arrest?

133
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,488
Search the ship.

134
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,031
What are
the charges?

135
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,866
You have the right to refuse
to answer questions

136
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,202
but such refusal may be
construed as a sign of guilt.

137
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,122
I demand to know what
I'm being accused of.

138
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,582
You deny all knowledge
of this crime, then?

139
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,335
How the hell am I supposed
to deny something

140
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,378
when I don't know what
you're talking about?

141
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,421
So you do<i> not</i>
deny all knowledge?

142
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:25,964
We are Federation
citizens

143
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,299
and we have rights.

144
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:28,800
Yes, yes,
all your rights

145
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,052
as defined
by Cardassian Articles

146
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,222
of Jurisprudence
will be protected.

147
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,516
I demand to speak
to my Commander.

148
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,685
We will contact your Commander

149
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,020
and see that your wife

150
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,896
is returned safely
to your station.

151
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,107
You will be taken
to Central Prison

152
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,859
on Cardassia Prime
to await trial.

153
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,153
All right.

154
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,404
I'm not going anywhere with you.

155
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,157
Miles!

156
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,409
Miles!

157
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,954
No!

158
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,749
Miles!

159
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,711
Miles!

160
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,091
CARDASSIAN:
Look to the children.

161
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,969
They are the future
of Cardassia

162
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,805
and they will lead the way.

163
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,725
Invest in their minds.

164
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,185
Teach them carefully...

165
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,940
CARDASSIAN:
Remove your clothes.

166
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,321
My name's Miles O'Brien.

167
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,907
My rank, Chief of Operations,
Starfleet.

168
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,743
I'm a Federation
citizen.

169
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,328
Remove your clothes.

170
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,622
My name is Miles O'Brien.

171
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,251
My rank is Chief of Operations,
Starfleet.

172
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,710
I'm a Federation citizen.

173
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,756
(<i> groaning</i> )

174
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,229
Would you care to make
a confession?

175
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,066
My name is Miles O'Brien.

176
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:11,152
My rank is Chief of Operations,
Starfleet.

177
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,447
I am a citizen
of the Federation!

178
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:14,989
Process him.

179
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:18,159
(<i> groaning</i> )

180
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,248

00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,736
My name is...

183
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,489
Miles...

184
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:58,074
O'Brien.

185
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,456
My rank is...

186
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:08,335
Chief of...

187
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,211
(<i> screaming</i> )

188
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,591
Operations...

189
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,316
Has he been processed?

190
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,609
CARDASSIAN:
He has.

191
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,992
You were told he was
not to be harmed.

192
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,118
He had to be
restrained.

193
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,203
Bring him
his clothing.

194
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,085
I apologize
for the way

195
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,296
you've been treated,
Mr. O'Brien.

196
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:56,966
I'm Makbar,
Chief Archon.

197
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,552
I want your stay here

198
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,719
to be as comfortable
as possible

199
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,305
under the circumstances.

200
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,807
I've scheduled
your trial to begin

201
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,393
in two days.

202
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,978
You've been assigned
the venerable Kovat

203
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,522
as public conservator.

204
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:11,606
As what?

205
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,233
Your lawyer.

206
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,859
Many feel that he's
the best counsel

207
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,319
in all Cardassia.

208
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:19,113
What do I need
a lawyer for?

209
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,366
What am I charged with?

210
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,159
Who's accusing me?

211
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:27,038
All in good time,
Mr. O'Brien.

212
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,165
All in good time.

213
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:40,009
Starfleet has ordered
the<i> Enterprise</i>

214
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,928
the<i> Prokofiev</i>
and the<i> Valdemar</i>

215
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,722
to the border
of the Demilitarized Zone.

216
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,557
Hopefully,
when the Cardassians see

217
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:47,601
that they are risking the
entire treaty over this...

218
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,769
In the meantime, my husband
is being violated by them.

219
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,939
Every shred of his humanity
is being violated.

220
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,274
Isn't that true?

221
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,900
We don't know
exactly...

222
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,360
Damn it!
Don't lie to me!

223
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,695
They're torturing him

224
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,363
as we sit here.

225
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,198
It is standard procedure
for the Cardassians

226
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,534
to use torture
in their interrogations.

227
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,078
You are correct,
Mrs. O'Brien.

228
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,709
You don't know how many times
Miles spoke to me about this--

229
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,168
what the Cardassians did

230
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,878
to the prisoners they
took at Setlik III.

231
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:16,921
What they were like

232
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,548
when they came back.

233
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,174
The thought of it

234
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,635
it disgusted him.

235
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:22,801
It scared him.

236
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,012
We can't leave him there.

237
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:28,849
We don't even know where he's
being held on Cardassia Prime.

238
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:34,855
Keiko, I promise you

239
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,399
as soon as we have
more information

240
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,735
I'll do everything
in my power to...

241
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,654
Commander, you have
a subspace transmission

242
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:41,780
from Cardassia Prime.

243
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,741
On screen.

244
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:51,414
I'm Benjamin Sisko,
Commander of Deep Space 9.

245
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,207
My name is Makbar.

246
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,252
I'm the archon representing
the Cardassian Empire

247
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,672
in its case
against Miles O'Brien.

248
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,424
- May I speak with him?
- That is not possible.

249
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:02,550
May I see him?

250
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,968
Commander...
May I be assured

251
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,844
that he is well
and being treated properly?

252
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:10,224
Mr. O'Brien is being treated
with great care and respect.

253
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,976
Good, because if he is not

254
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,228
I will hold you
personally responsible.

255
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,981
And if that sounds
like a threat, it is.

256
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,651
Gul Dukat's told me about you.

257
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:23,488
You live up
to your reputation, Commander.

258
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,072
That's right, I do.

259
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,451
Now, what are the charges
against Chief O'Brien?

260
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,412
The charges will be announced
when the trial begins

261
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,123
as is customary
in Cardassian jurisprudence.

262
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,334
How can we prepare
for the trial

263
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,336
if we don't know the charges?

264
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,962
Mrs. O'Brien, I take it?

265
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,631
Yes.

266
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,633
Mrs. O'Brien, there's nothing
for you to prepare.

267
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,052
Your husband's verdict
has already been determined.

268
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,053
He is guilty.

269
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,888
The trial will reveal

270
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,974
how this guilt was proven
by the most efficient

271
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,894
criminal investigation system
in the Quadrant.

272
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,398
You may, if you desire,
attend this trial, which begins

273
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,774
in two days' time.

274
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,442
We'll be there.

275
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,736
Oh, I'm sorry, Commander.

276
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,362
This is a privilege

277
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,240
enjoyed solely by the spouse
of an offender.

278
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,991
What about his nestor?

279
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,495
His counsel and his nestor
will be assigned by the court.

280
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,205
Nestor?

281
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:16,123
Advisor to the offender.

282
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:20,127
Madam Archon, I volunteer to
serve as nestor in this trial.

283
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,880
That is not possible.

284
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,882
The nestor must be
an officer of the court.

285
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,966
I am an officer
of the court.

286
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,677
Chief of Security Odo.

287
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:31,222
I served Gul Dukat on Terok Nor.

288
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,932
You may check my credentials.

289
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,102
I was designated an officer
of the Cardassian Court

290
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:39,230
four years ago, in order
to testify in criminal cases.

291
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,357
Very well.

292
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,735
If this is true,
you may accompany Mrs. O'Brien

293
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,653
and serve as nestor.

294
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:49,031
May I ask, what penalty
does Mr. O'Brien face?

295
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:52,326
His execution is scheduled
for next week.

296
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,537
How can you schedule
an execution

297
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,706
before a trial
even begins?

298
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,292
We believe in swift justice.

299
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,338
Mrs. O'Brien, we should
leave immediately.

300
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,468
Begin a complete security sweep
of the station

301
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,762
and Chief O'Brien's
recent activities.

302
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:14,181
I want to know if there's
anything out of the ordinary

303
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,809
that might begin
to explain this.

304
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,727
Commander, Chief
O'Brien's attitude

305
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,729
towards the Cardassians
is hardly a secret.

306
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:22,398
What if he actually
has done something?

307
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:27,528
Then we need to know
that, too, don't we?

308
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,089
Miles O'Brien?

309
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,926
Eh, yes, of course you are.

310
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:01,604
I'm Conservator Kovat.

311
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,607
I've been told that I've
already been charged

312
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:07,234
indicted, convicted
and sentenced.

313
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,737
What would I need
with a lawyer?

314
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:13,741
Ah, Mr. O'Brien,
if it sounds

315
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,076
immodest of me,
I apologize,

316
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,245
but the role of
public conservator

317
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:22,291
is key to the productive
functioning of our courts.

318
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:27,421
I'm here to help you concede
the wisdom of the state,

319
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:32,593
to prepare you to accept the
inevitable with equanimity.

320
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,887
Ha!

321
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,722
(<i> snorts derisively</i> )

322
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:42,144
There's an old
Cardassian expression:

323
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,898
"Confession is good
for the soul."

324
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:49,193
But it's also good
for the populace to see
people like you confess.

325
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,070
It makes them feel better
about themselves.

326
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,532
It makes them--
makes their lives
more bearable.

327
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,284
So, that's
what this is all about?

328
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,830
Make the people
of Cardassia feel better, huh?

329
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,707
No, no, no, no.
But that's...

330
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:05,877
that's not a bad side effect.

331
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:13,217
Now then, we have
your biographical extracts.

332
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,344
We have
your Starfleet records.

333
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,889
All this will be very useful.

334
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:20,600
What am I being charged with?

335
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,394
Oh, no need to worry about that

336
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,229
at this point.

337
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,023
This is insane!

338
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,108
Now, whatever you've done

339
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,318
whatever the charges
against you

340
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,530
none of that really matters
in the long run.

341
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,074
What does matter?

342
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:38,785
This trial is to demonstrate

343
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:43,205
the futility of behavior
contrary to good order.

344
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,542
Everyone will find it
most uplifting.

345
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,086
Not everyone.

346
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,004
Once again, justice
will be done.

347
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:53,841
Our lives will be reaffirmed,
safe and secure.

348
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,886
Here on Cardassia,
all crimes are solved,

349
00:18:56,886 --> 00:19:00,890
all criminals are punished,
all endings are happy.

350
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:05,227
Even the poorest of our subjects
can walk the streets

351
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,397
in the dead of night
in perfect safety.

352
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:12,860
You're only one man,
but your conviction

353
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:17,698
will be a salutary experience
for millions.

354
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,035
Now then...

355
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,121
the trial
opens tomorrow.

356
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,331
Do you have
any questions

357
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,917
anything you
want to tell me?

358
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,544
Only that I am not guilty
of any crime

359
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,131
and that I hold
this entire procedure

360
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:35,049
with nothing
but contempt.

361
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,176
That's good,
that's good.

362
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,303
Maintain that level
of arrogance

363
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,014
in the courtroom

364
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,975
and we shall put on
a very good show, indeed.

365
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:46,352
Oh, I do have
one question.

366
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,104
Yes, certainly.

367
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:51,649
Have you ever won a case?

368
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:54,819
Winning isn't everything.

369
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,369
(<i> sighs</i> )

370
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,800
Are they all like this?
KIRA:
All of them.

371
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,720
There isn't a photon warhead
left in here.

372
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,804
How could somebody transport

373
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,556
two dozen warheads
off this station

374
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,266
without the perimeter
sensors picking it up?

375
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,061
The metal in these crates

376
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,604
has the same mass
as the warheads.

377
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,815
A transporter
could have been programmed

378
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,108
to switch the two
simultaneously.

379
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,318
The sensors could
have been fooled.

380
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,279
But it would require
a transporter expert.

381
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,615
I know what you're
implying, Major,
and I don't like it.

382
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,951
Neither do I,
but there is more.

383
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,163
According to the logs,
O'Brien was in here

384
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,665
just minutes before
his runabout left.

385
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,877
Computer, play
Security Log entry

386
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:56,047
Stardate 47944.2--
weapons locker.

387
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,465
O'BRIEN:
Request access

388
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:01,552
Weapons Locker 4,
Miles O'Brien

389
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,137
Security Level One.

390
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:05,639
The computer confirmed
his voiceprint ID

391
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,225
and let him in.

392
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:09,143
As soon as the door opened

393
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:11,562
some kind of
field saturation device

394
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:14,732
was activated that froze all the
security scanners in the room.

395
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:17,484
I want a full analysis
of that voiceprint.

396
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,862
Make absolutely sure
it was O'Brien.

397
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,115
But it doesn't make sense.

398
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,491
What would he do
with photon warheads?

399
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,077
KIRA:
Give them
to the Maquis.

400
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,121
We had an advisory
two weeks ago

401
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,289
that a Maquis
ship disabled a
Bolian freighter

402
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,875
near the Demilitarized
Zone and stole

403
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,877
a supply of
photon launchers.

404
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,336
Launchers but no warheads.

405
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,839
Launchers, but no warheads.

406
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,175
You're suggesting
that Miles O'Brien

407
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,719
took his wife on
a romantic vacation

408
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,555
as an excuse to deliver
warheads to the Maquis?

409
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,599
I don't believe it!
If these warheads

410
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:51,060
<i>were</i> in the runabout,
they'll be used

411
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,146
as evidence
in the trial.
Commander!

412
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:54,521
We'll find that out
soon enough.

413
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,107
If they were
in the runabout

414
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,691
how did the Cardassians
find out?

415
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,444
That's the one question
I want an answer to.

416
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:03,447
I also want to find out
who the other guy was.

417
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,949
The other guy?

418
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:07,660
The one who was waiting
to receive these warheads.

419
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,996
I'll have Starfleet Intelligence

420
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,039
begin to pick up Maquis suspects
for questioning.

421
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,041
In the meantime,
let's see if we can ID

422
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,542
any possible Maquis members

423
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,628
who have been
on the station recently.

424
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,130
Dismissed.

425
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,519
Tell me you're here
to take me home.

426
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,313
I'm sorry.

427
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:41,110
How have they
treated you?

428
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,780
Not so bad.

429
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,907
They did some dental
work when I got here

430
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,659
that wasn't much fun.

431
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,328
All Cardassians are required

432
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:52,163
to give the Bureau
of Identification

433
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:53,747
one of their first molars.

434
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,292
It's usually extracted
at age ten.

435
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,713
Keiko... is
she all right?

436
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,798
She came with me.

437
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,717
She's here? Now?

438
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:08,012
It's not permitted
for family members

439
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:11,098
to visit offenders
in confinement.

440
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:14,560
She'll be at
the trial tomorrow.

441
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,855
The Cardassians
always invite families

442
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:20,149
to trials and executions

443
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:23,194
so that the public
can see them weep.

444
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:24,945
No.

445
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,739
I don't want her there.

446
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,242
I don't want her
to see me like this.

447
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:31,994
I think that's a mistake.

448
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:34,205
My lawyer has
already told me.

449
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:36,665
It's all over
but the execution.

450
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,585
I... I don't even know
what I'm charged with!

451
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,712
Did they tell
<i>you</i> anything?

452
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:44,840
No... but we have an idea.

453
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,967
What?

454
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,594
Have you ever had

455
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,721
any dealings
with the Maquis?

456
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,056
Dealings?

457
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,058
No. I'm not sure
what you mean.

458
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,269
Do you know anybody
in the Maquis?

459
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,853
No.

460
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,356
Ever supplied any
of them with weapons?

461
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:01,857
No!

462
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,985
Are you here
to interrogate
me, Constable?

463
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:08,364
Is anyone ever going to tell me
what I'm supposed to have done?

464
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:11,325
Commander Sisko informed me
a few hours ago

465
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:14,745
that 24 photon warheads
are missing from the station.

466
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:18,374
We believe they may have been
in your runabout's cargo bay

467
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:21,501
intended for the Maquis.

468
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:24,797
The Cardassians did find
something in the hold.
That's true.

469
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:27,633
But you know nothing about it?
Nothing.

470
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,468
And you didn't transport them
from Weapons Locker 4

471
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:32,721
just before you left
the station?
No.

472
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:36,474
Were you<i> in</i> Weapons Locker 4
before you left the station?

473
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:39,728
No!
Then why does the log
say that you were?

474
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,188
Why was it your voice

475
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,232
releasing
the security lock?

476
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,858
My voice?

477
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,484
Your voice.

478
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,949
I don't know.

479
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:53,909
(<i> laughs</i> )

480
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:58,038
You don't know me very well,
Constable, but I... I...

481
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:04,253
I've been in service
to the Federation-- Starfleet--

482
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:06,005
all my adult life.

483
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:09,383
No one has ever questioned
my loyalty.

484
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:13,387
No one in my entire life
has ever had cause to ask

485
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:16,723
"Miles O'Brien,
are you a criminal?"

486
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,727
I took an oath...

487
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:24,940
to defend the Federation
and what it stands for.

488
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,984
I don't steal from them.

489
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,486
I don't lie to them.

490
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:32,239
I'm no angel,
but I try to live every day

491
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:35,659
as the best human being
I know how to be.

492
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,954
I need my little girl
to wake up in the morning

493
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:42,375
and look up at me
and see a man she can respect.

494
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:46,170
Until now, she always could.

495
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,678
Being accused of a crime
is not a disgrace, Chief.

496
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,141
Some of the great figures
of history

497
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:01,352
have shared the honor with you.

498
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,606
I didn't figure
on dying a martyr.

499
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,988
Not all of them were martyrs.

500
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,907
Not all of them died.

501
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,743
Some of them were
just innocent men

502
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,370
like you.

503
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,792
Now, I've managed
to get myself

504
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,753
named to your
defense team.

505
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,338
I'll be there tomorrow.

506
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,173
Your wife will be there,
as well

507
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:34,176
but she won't be weeping,
and neither will you.

508
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,220
I want the archon to see

509
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,056
the clear, unwavering eyes
of an innocent man.

510
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:40,974
Is that understood?

511
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,601
Yes, sir.

512
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:44,853
Guard!

513
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,358
I'll see you tomorrow.

514
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,110
Odo...

515
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,571
thanks for being here.

516
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,751
DAX:
The voice modulation patterns

517
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,545
don't match up.

518
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,713
See how the peaks here
and here are out of phase?

519
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,631
So, we can prove
it wasn't O'Brien

520
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,301
who entered
the weapons locker.

521
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,303
It's O'Brien's voice,
but the sentence

522
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:19,138
was reconstructed
sound by sound.

523
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:21,557
I've got our Maquis.

524
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,309
I narrowed the suspects down

525
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:26,145
to 12 people who live
in the Demilitarized Zone

526
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,563
and were on the station
that day.

527
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,482
Raymond Boone, human.
Lives on Volon III.

528
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:30,983
Three merchants
on the Promenade

529
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,610
saw him talking to O'Brien
just before he left.

530
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:35,446
Talking to him--
and recording
his voice perhaps?

531
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:37,573
Recording?
DAX:
Someone doctored

532
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:38,824
Chief O'Brien's voice

533
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,117
to get into
the weapons locker.

534
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:43,454
I'll have him
picked up.

535
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,707
The offender,
Miles O'Brien, human

536
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:50,461
officer of
the Federation Starfleet

537
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:52,171
has been found guilty

538
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,465
of aiding and abetting
seditious acts

539
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:57,092
against the state.

540
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,718
The sentence is death.

541
00:27:58,718 --> 00:27:59,970
Let the trial begin.

542
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,181
(<i> bang</i> )

543
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,433
Conservator Kovat,
is the offender

544
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,560
ready to face
his judgment?

545
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,020
He is, Madam Archon.

546
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,188
Let him enter.

547
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:18,738
(<i> knuckles tapping</i> )

548
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,541
MAKBAR:
Mr. O'Brien

549
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:31,793
you can spare your family
and the Federation

550
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:35,255
further humiliation by
dispensing with this proceeding

551
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,965
and confessing now.

552
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,925
No, thanks.

553
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,387
Very well.

554
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:43,930
The Nestor
and Mrs. O'Brien may enter.

555
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:50,062
MAKBAR:
Mrs. O'Brien

556
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,814
this court recognizes
the disgrace

557
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,108
your husband has brought to you.

558
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:58,237
As is prescribed in
the Cardassian Articles

559
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,906
of Jurisprudence,
we hereby offer you

560
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:04,493
the opportunity to disassociate
yourself from his actions

561
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,328
by testifying
against him.

562
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,080
I have no intention

563
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,166
of testifying
against my husband.

564
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,128
Call the first witness.

565
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,130
Madam Archon

566
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,465
may I confer privately

567
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,676
with the Conservator
before we begin?

568
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:21,968
(<i> sigh of annoyance</i> )

569
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:24,513
I believe
that this is the first time

570
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:28,267
you are serving as nestor,
so perhaps I should explain

571
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:31,353
that you have no authority
to address this court.

572
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:34,189
You assist the defendant,
that is all.

573
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,316
I beg the court's indulgence.
I am new at this.

574
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,444
MAKBAR:
All of Cardassia
is watching

575
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,028
these proceedings.

576
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,155
Private conferences
do not make for good viewing.

577
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,365
You should have done this

578
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,492
before we
convened.

579
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:48,245
Very well.
Make it quick.

580
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:52,999
Please don't
ruin this for me.

581
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,752
I'm only a year away
from retirement.

582
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:56,211
We have new evidence

583
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,213
to prove O'Brien's
innocence.

584
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,632
New evidence?

585
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:01,508
If O'Brien is accused
of stealing warheads

586
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,510
from Deep Space 9,
we can prove that
he didn't do it.

587
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,928
KOVAT:
Of course he did it.

588
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,346
He's been found
guilty, hasn't he?

589
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,098
Someone manipulated
a recording

590
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:09,516
of his voice
to gain entry.

591
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,769
I can produce that
recording here.

592
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:13,270
No evidence can
be submitted

593
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,772
after the verdict
has been reached.

594
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:16,898
You should know that.
Of course,

595
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,734
but I was
hoping that the most

596
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:21,194
renowned conservator
in all of Cardassia...

597
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:24,406
You flatter me, sir,
you flatter me.

598
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,199
But we want justice

599
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,577
not chaos in this court.

600
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:31,079
No, I will have
no part of this.

601
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,623
MAKBAR:
Enough!

602
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:35,125
Are you ready to proceed,
Conservator?

603
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,293
I am.

604
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:37,919
Madam Archon, may
I address the court?

605
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,213
Didn't I just explain to you
that you may not?

606
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,548
But if our Conservator

607
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,550
refuses to bring up
new evidence...

608
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,177
Silence!
...of a manipulated

609
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:46,637
recording of the
offender's voice

610
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:47,971
that would prove
his innocence...

611
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,640
You are out of order, sir!

612
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,517
What else am I
supposed to do?

613
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:55,061
You are supposed to respect
our judicial procedures.

614
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:57,897
Wouldn't you ask
that we respect your rules

615
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,608
if we were in
your court?

616
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,568
Which raises my next point,
Madam Archon.

617
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,070
I would like to move for
a change of venue<i> to</i> my court.

618
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,531
No crime has been committed

619
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,491
against
Cardassia.

620
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:10,452
It was, in fact, committed
at a Bajoran space station.

621
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:12,788
Madam Archon,
I am extremely humiliated.

622
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:15,040
I ask to be relieved
of this assignment.

623
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,124
MAKBAR:
No!

624
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,250
Sit down!

625
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,549
And you, sir...

626
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:27,302
do not try the patience
of the Cardassian people.

627
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,805
If this court finds you
in contempt

628
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:33,141
you will find the punishment
very unpleasant.

629
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,728
I regret that I have no teeth

630
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:39,272
to offer your Bureau
of Identification.

631
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:45,612
As for new evidence, yes,
I fully expected the Federation

632
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,281
to come up with
remarkable new evidence

633
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,576
in an attempt
to free Mr. O'Brien.

634
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,285
I am sure
your<i> experts</i>

635
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,663
can create all
sorts of evidence

636
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:56,707
to confuse the issues.

637
00:31:56,707 --> 00:32:00,711
That may work in your courts,
but not here.

638
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:04,089
There will be no new
evidence considered.

639
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,925
(<i> bang</i> )

640
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,719
Call the first witness!

641
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:14,641
Look, we're not
after the Maquis.

642
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,602
We're just trying to
help an innocent man.

643
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:18,353
And I'm telling you.
I don't have

644
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,230
any idea what
you're talking about.

645
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,608
People saw you
talking to O'Brien

646
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,025
just before he left.

647
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,819
Well, since when is
that a crime?

648
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:28,196
We're old friends
from the<i> Rutledge.</i>

649
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,531
Doesn't it bother you

650
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,157
that an old friend is
about to be executed

651
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,492
by the Cardassians?

652
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,035
Of course it does.

653
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,079
I wish there was something
I could do to help.

654
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:39,249
He has a wife
and a five-year-old daughter.

655
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:41,794
If you're worried
we'll turn you over

656
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:45,505
to the Cardassians,
I can assure you that we won't.

657
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,507
Well, I haven't done anything.

658
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:50,343
I don't have anything
to be worried about.

659
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:55,307
Hold him for
further questioning.

660
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:09,404
Computer, lights.

661
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,336
(<i> sigh of frustration</i> )

662
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,379
Don't turn around,
Doctor.

663
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,548
There's nothing here
you could want.

664
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,050
You have a man in custody
suspected of arranging the theft

665
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:35,180
of photon warheads--
Raymond Boone.

666
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,723
That's right.

667
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,184
I'm here to tell you
he is not one of us.

668
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,144
"Not one of us"?

669
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,563
You're from the Maquis.

670
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,024
That's correct.

671
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,484
Why should I believe you?

672
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:50,362
We knew nothing
about the theft

673
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,865
and this man
is not one of us.

674
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:55,074
And that's all
I can tell you.

675
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,618
How do I know

676
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:59,329
you're not just trying
to protect him?

677
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:01,164
Who else would want photon...

678
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,041
warheads?

679
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:08,254
The Maquis are savage,
Federation-born killers!

680
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,882
They live to terrorize

681
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:12,885
and murder innocent Cardassians

682
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:16,680
as evidenced by these weapons we
confiscated from O'Brien's ship.

683
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:21,100
These Maquis are based
in the Demilitarized Zone?

684
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,687
They are all from
Federation settlements

685
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:26,439
inside Cardassian
occupied territory.

686
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:29,609
Frankly, the situation
is becoming untenable.

687
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:32,821
How many more innocent
people must die

688
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:35,532
before the situation
becomes clear?

689
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:38,117
How do you know
these photon warheads

690
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,370
recovered from
the offender's vessel

691
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,540
were intended
for the Maquis?

692
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:47,586
According to reliable sources,
the Maquis arranged the theft.

693
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,212
I object!

694
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,798
Madam Archon,<i> please!</i>

695
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:54,927
I thought we went over this
yesterday, Mr. Odo.

696
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:57,012
What is it
this time?

697
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:59,890
Gul Evek has tied the Maquis
to this plot

698
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,225
by quoting reliable sources.

699
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,061
I think we deserve to know

700
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:06,730
who these reliable
sources are.

701
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,440
Can you provide
any details,
Gul Evek?

702
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,776
I am afraid that information
cannot be revealed

703
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:13,111
without risk to national
security, Madam Archon.

704
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,654
That's an acceptable answer.

705
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,489
Might we know how Gul Evek

706
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:19,242
learned the warheads
were in the runabout?

707
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,827
Yes, of course.

708
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,329
We learned about them
from reliable sources.

709
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:26,165
MAKBAR:
Are you satisfied,
Nestor?

710
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:28,043
Madam Archon...

711
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:31,004
Enough! This is already
the longest trial

712
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:33,339
in the history of Cardassia.

713
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:36,259
Let's try to speed things up,
shall we?

714
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,179
Proceed,
Mr. Kovat.

715
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:43,100
As you wish, Madam Archon.

716
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,436
I'll try to
be as brief
as possible.

717
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:52,067
What is this?

718
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,485
I'd like Dr. Bashir
to give you

719
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:54,569
a physical
examination.

720
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,946
What for?

721
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:58,031
To help us answer some
questions about you.

722
00:35:58,031 --> 00:35:59,491
What are you talking about?

723
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,994
For example,
why you haven't spoken

724
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:03,870
to your parents
in eight years.

725
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,123
What's that got to do
with anything?

726
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:07,499
I never got along with them.

727
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,501
That's not what
they told us.

728
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:12,295
You left your wife
about eight years ago.

729
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,213
You'd been married
a long time--

730
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,590
almost 15 years, wasn't it?

731
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,968
Look, this is none
of your business.

732
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:19,511
And about the same time

733
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:22,014
you were discharged
from Starfleet

734
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:24,099
after failing several crew
performance reviews.

735
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,143
All of this
seemed to happen

736
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:28,227
shortly after
Setlik III.

737
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,440
BASHIR:
Bring him
over here.

738
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:38,155
Some romantic vacation
I took you on, huh?

739
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:41,366
We'll have
other chances.

740
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:44,161
Keiko, I don't want you
to be there next week.

741
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:45,662
It isn't over yet.

742
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,873
Don't give them
the satisfaction.

743
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:48,957
Miles, you can't just...

744
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,375
I mean it.

745
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:53,419
(<i> gong sounds</i> )

746
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,895
Court will resume.

747
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,898
The offender will

748
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,900
step forward and testify.

749
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,694
I have nothing
to say to this court.

750
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:20,864
Under Cardassian law,
you are compelled to testify.

751
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:22,574
Step forward.

752
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,248
This would be a good time

753
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,000
to advise the offender.

754
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,211
Advise him to do what?

755
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:35,879
To confess.

756
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:38,715
To throw himself on the mercy
of the court, of course.

757
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:42,552
I never heard of
a Cardassian court
showing mercy.

758
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:46,223
That is not the<i> point.</i>

759
00:37:46,223 --> 00:37:50,936
Think of the children, sir.

760
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:56,315
Allow them to see
a glimmer of enlightenment.

761
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:59,277
As the offender realizes

762
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,072
that the end is near,

763
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:07,452
let him use
his last breath
to show remorse.

764
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:09,579
Do you wish
to advise the offender

765
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:11,123
at this time, Nestor?

766
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,292
No, Madam Archon.

767
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,754
Very well.
Proceed, Mr. Kovat.

768
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,929
Mr. O'Brien

769
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:29,515
were you abused as a child?

770
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:30,516
What?

771
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,351
Were your parents

772
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,271
especially abusive?

773
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:37,065
Did you hate them very much?

774
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:39,734
I loved my parents.

775
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,987
I see.

776
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:49,410
Spousal abuse, perhaps?

777
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,497
Was your wife
causing you

778
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,540
severe psychological stress?

779
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,375
My wife is the most wonderful

780
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,170
supportive person
I've ever known.

781
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,796
Excuse me for asking.

782
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:02,132
I'm merely trying to establish

783
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:05,802
why a<i> fine</i> man like you
could turn into a criminal.

784
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:08,638
Now, perhaps you could help me.

785
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:11,266
Sorry, no, I can't help,
because I'm no criminal.

786
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:14,811
Well...

787
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,437
I tried.

788
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,066
MAKBAR:
Tell me,
Mr. O'Brien

789
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:22,652
how many Cardassians
have you killed?

790
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:23,945
Killed?

791
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:25,613
None.

792
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,699
Since the war, that is.

793
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,617
Including the war

794
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:33,412
how many Cardassians
have you killed?

795
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,665
Madam Archon,
what relevance

796
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:38,835
does Mr. O'Brien's
war experiences have?

797
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:40,962
His past criminal record

798
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:44,007
is very much relevant
to these proceedings, sir.

799
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:46,009
Answer the question.

800
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:49,137
I'm not sure.

801
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,680
That many, eh?

802
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,015
It was war.

803
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:54,184
Both sides did things
they had to do.

804
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:58,271
Tell me, Mr. O'Brien,
now that we are at peace

805
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:01,566
do you have a warm place
in your heart

806
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,609
for your
Cardassian
neighbors

807
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:08,614
or are you deeply prejudiced
against Cardassians?

808
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:11,409
Do you not, in fact,
hate Cardassians?

809
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,786
Have you not
on several occasions

810
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:17,332
publicly stated
your opposition to the treaty

811
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:19,167
because, and I quote,

812
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:22,754
"The bloody Cardies
can't be trusted"?

813
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,547
I decline to answer that.

814
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,258
There are
no grounds

815
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:28,509
in Cardassian law
which permit you to decline.

816
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,677
Answer the question.

817
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:33,932
Is it an accurate
quote or not?

818
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,475
It is.

819
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:39,020
Madam Archon,
at this time

820
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:43,733
it seems the offender's guilt
has been clearly established

821
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:48,113
and I see no other alternative
but to concede the verdict.

822
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:49,530
I do not concede!

823
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,032
You may stand
down, Mr. O'Brien.

824
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:53,118
I am not guilty!

825
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:54,744
I've committed no crime

826
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:57,330
and I do not concede
to this court

827
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,416
or the Cardassian Empire!

828
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:01,209
Madam Archon, I apologize

829
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:03,962
but I appear to have lost
control of my client.

830
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,755
MAKBAR:
No matter.

831
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:09,592
You've done your usual
eloquent job on his behalf

832
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,303
Conservator Kovat.

833
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:13,054
Thank you, Madam Archon.

834
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:15,473
This has been
a most difficult case

835
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,435
but it is always an honor
to serve your court.

836
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:19,811
(<i> door opens</i> )

837
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:27,860
KOVAT:
I object to this.

838
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,695
Madam Archon

839
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:33,283
how can you continue
to tolerate these intrusions?

840
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:36,494
Return to your seat.

841
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,794
Once again

842
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:47,464
the Cardassian System
of Jurisprudence

843
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:50,008
has worked
to protect its people.

844
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:53,928
A guilty man
has been brought to justice.

845
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,431
But never let it be said

846
00:41:56,431 --> 00:42:01,394
that there is no room
in this system for compassion.

847
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:03,729
I sense in
Mr. O'Brien--

848
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:06,565
a man with strong
family ties--

849
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:09,986
the potential for
rehabilitation.

850
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:12,197
And I'm sure that he has gained

851
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:14,699
a new appreciation
of Cardassian law

852
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:17,035
through this difficult process.

853
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,870
Therefore, I am pleased

854
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:23,082
in the spirit of furthering
Cardassian-Federation relations

855
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:27,337
to hereby set aside the verdict
and to release Mr. O'Brien

856
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:29,797
into the custody
of his Commander

857
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,674
Benjamin Sisko.

858
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:37,180
(<i> bang</i> )

859
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,807
(<i> stammering</i> )

860
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,226
What happened?

861
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:42,227
What...

862
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:43,436
You won.

863
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:44,770
I...

864
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,236
They'll kill me.

865
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:59,536
KEIKO:
Then the Maquis
<i>told</i> you about Boone.

866
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:01,954
When Doctor Bashir
examined him

867
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:05,208
he discovered that Boone
was missing his first molar.

868
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:08,211
The DNA analysis confirmed
that he was Cardassian.

869
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:10,463
He was surgically altered?

870
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,715
Eight years ago, to replace
the real Raymond Boone

871
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,675
who was taken prisoner
at Setlik III

872
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,095
and apparently
killed in detention.

873
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:18,679
Well, how did you figure it out?

874
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,306
His ex-wife told us

875
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,725
he came back from captivity
a different man.

876
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,311
She blamed it
on the treatment he received

877
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,523
from the Cardassians,
but it started us to thinking.

878
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:30,900
So, he was spying
for the Cardassians

879
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,486
even when he was serving
on the<i> Rutledge</i> with me?

880
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:35,447
But why would they
want to frame Miles?

881
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:36,906
ODO:
This trial was never

882
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:39,284
about your husband,
Mrs. O'Brien.

883
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:40,618
It was designed
from the beginning

884
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,161
to discredit the Federation--

885
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,330
to show that the Maquis
had their official sanction.

886
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,624
Gul Evek's testimony
made it clear

887
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,294
that the situation
had become untenable.

888
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:51,212
Next, they would
have been demanding

889
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:53,131
that the Federation
colonies be disbanded.

890
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:54,673
Exactly.

891
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:57,093
When Makbar saw Boone
in the courtroom

892
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:59,720
she realized that we had
the goods to embarrass

893
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,432
the High Command
in front of the entire populace.

894
00:44:02,432 --> 00:44:04,767
Oh, I'm just glad
it's all over.

895
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:07,979
I'm ready to get back
to work.

896
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,522
SISKO:
Oh, no, no, no.

897
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:11,857
I had to use
all of my influence

898
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:14,026
to extend your accommodations
at the lagoon.

899
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,695
We'll drop you off
on our way home.

900
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:19,115
But we haven't any bags,
no holo-cam.

901
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:21,618
I've nothing to read.

902
00:44:21,618 --> 00:44:23,035
Perfect.
