1
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:04,729
What's funny is where
the files were located...

2
00:00:04,768 --> 00:00:06,168
right there in Ops protocols.

3
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:08,741
The encryption system
was extremely easy to break.

4
00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:10,507
So, they wanted us
to find these?

5
00:00:10,546 --> 00:00:12,140
Or they didn't care.

6
00:00:12,182 --> 00:00:14,448
Well, there's nothing
of strategic value here...

7
00:00:14,487 --> 00:00:17,459
just some personal logs

8
00:00:17,493 --> 00:00:19,656
and some files
on Bajoran terrorists

9
00:00:19,698 --> 00:00:22,397
but it is a glimpse
into the Cardassian mind.

10
00:00:22,436 --> 00:00:25,203
You might want to warn Kira
before she sees her file.

11
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:27,006
Warn me?
About what?

12
00:00:27,046 --> 00:00:29,016
Oh, uh...

13
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,644
Dax and Mr. O'Brien

14
00:00:30,687 --> 00:00:34,354
discovered some of the last
Prefect's personal files.

15
00:00:34,393 --> 00:00:36,226
There's a file on you

16
00:00:36,297 --> 00:00:38,426
but you may find it
disappointing.

17
00:00:38,468 --> 00:00:40,028
I'm a big girl, Commander.

18
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:54,666
Bashir to Sisko.

19
00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:55,726
Sisko here.

20
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,102
I'm at Airlock 14, Commander.

21
00:00:57,139 --> 00:00:58,505
I think you better
get down here.

22
00:00:58,541 --> 00:00:59,839
What's the problem, Doctor?

23
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:01,814
Well, I was about to begin
off-loading

24
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:04,412
some medical specimens
from the Bajoran transport

25
00:01:04,453 --> 00:01:05,921
and, well...

26
00:01:05,957 --> 00:01:08,427
the Kai is here.

27
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:10,363
Kai... Opaka.

28
00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:12,426
Why would she be here?

29
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:16,409
She said you once offered her
a tour of the station.

30
00:01:18,314 --> 00:01:20,945
"A minor operative

31
00:01:20,987 --> 00:01:23,355
"whose activities are limited
to running errands

32
00:01:23,391 --> 00:01:24,791
for the terrorist leaders"?!

33
00:01:24,828 --> 00:01:27,527
Major, when you're through
feeling underappreciated

34
00:01:27,566 --> 00:01:30,732
perhaps you'd join me
in welcoming the Kai aboard.

35
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:49,675
You say she's never
been here before?

36
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:52,079
She's never even left
Bajor before.

37
00:01:52,115 --> 00:01:54,678
Well, excuse me
for saying so, Commander

38
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:57,989
but she looks... preoccupied.

39
00:02:09,718 --> 00:02:13,054
Is something wrong, Opaka?

40
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,619
Contemplating prophecy.

41
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:21,302
It's interesting you
chose this viewport.

42
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,708
The wormhole is just out there.

43
00:02:23,746 --> 00:02:26,114
It's a spectacular sight to see.

44
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,484
Unfortunately,
it can only be seen

45
00:02:28,521 --> 00:02:30,684
when a ship enters it or exits

46
00:02:30,726 --> 00:02:33,527
but there's nothing
scheduled for today.

47
00:02:33,565 --> 00:02:35,159
A shame.

48
00:02:39,176 --> 00:02:41,739
Sisko to O'Brien.

49
00:02:41,782 --> 00:02:43,148
Go ahead, Commander.

50
00:02:43,184 --> 00:02:45,279
Prepare the <i>Yangtzee Kiang</i>
for launch, Chief.

51
00:02:45,322 --> 00:02:48,783
Kira and I are taking
the Kai through the wormhole.

52
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,127
Right away, sir.

53
00:02:50,165 --> 00:02:51,497
Thank you.

54
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:58,275
I didn't want to keep you
from your duties, Doctor.

55
00:02:58,314 --> 00:02:59,805
Oh, it's a slow day.

56
00:02:59,851 --> 00:03:01,149
All right.

57
00:03:01,187 --> 00:03:02,450
This way.

58
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,950
Is the ship ready, Chief?

59
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,553
All prepped
and ready for departure

60
00:03:22,596 --> 00:03:23,564
Commander.

61
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:24,566
Ma'am.

62
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,160
After you.

63
00:03:33,117 --> 00:03:35,144
You have a child, don't you?

64
00:03:35,188 --> 00:03:36,383
I do.

65
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,517
I have a little girl, ma'am.

66
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:39,859
Yes.

67
00:03:44,606 --> 00:03:47,772
Would you give this
to her for me?

68
00:06:21,613 --> 00:06:24,176
We'll be entering the wormhole
in about a minute.

69
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,085
Thank you again
for indulging me.

70
00:06:26,122 --> 00:06:27,351
Not at all, Opaka.

71
00:06:27,391 --> 00:06:29,623
You honor us with your presence.

72
00:06:29,662 --> 00:06:31,325
<i>Yangtzee Kiang</i> to DS9.

73
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:33,929
Estimated time of return,
1400 hours.

74
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:36,703
Logged in.
We'll expect you then.

75
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:38,679
Flight stabilization at maximum.

76
00:06:38,714 --> 00:06:41,686
Here we go.

77
00:06:58,186 --> 00:06:59,985
Spectacular, isn't it?

78
00:07:00,023 --> 00:07:01,856
More than I imagined.

79
00:07:01,893 --> 00:07:04,922
My smoothest ride yet, Major.

80
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:07,401
There's Idran,
the closest system.

81
00:07:07,438 --> 00:07:09,169
It's a ternary star.

82
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,939
A doorway into the unknown.

83
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,576
The other side
of the galaxy, to be precise.

84
00:07:13,617 --> 00:07:16,418
The Gamma Quadrant is 70,000
light years from Bajor.

85
00:07:16,456 --> 00:07:18,926
It would take
our fastest starship

86
00:07:18,961 --> 00:07:20,954
over 67 years to get here.

87
00:07:21,032 --> 00:07:23,434
I'm glad I got the chance
to see it.

88
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,565
You'll be seeing
what this wormhole

89
00:07:25,607 --> 00:07:27,668
is worth to Bajor
in a few years.

90
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:32,913
If that is to be my fate,
Commander.

91
00:07:32,956 --> 00:07:34,288
Should I reverse course?

92
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:35,452
So soon?

93
00:07:35,494 --> 00:07:39,093
There's not much else
to show you yet.

94
00:07:39,135 --> 00:07:41,332
Prophecy can often be vague,
Commander.

95
00:07:41,372 --> 00:07:43,501
That's why we must test it.

96
00:07:45,347 --> 00:07:47,749
I don't understand, Opaka.

97
00:07:51,593 --> 00:07:53,859
You may return.

98
00:07:53,897 --> 00:07:56,494
Take us back
to the wormhole, Major.

99
00:07:56,536 --> 00:07:57,970
Coming about.

100
00:07:58,006 --> 00:08:01,810
Sensors are picking up
a narrow band subspace signal.

101
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:03,178
What do you make of it?

102
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:06,313
Just a long stream
of statistical data

103
00:08:06,356 --> 00:08:09,157
followed by a request
for a reply.

104
00:08:09,195 --> 00:08:11,826
Uh, I'm not reading
any response.

105
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,995
Launch a class-2 probe.
We'll follow it up later.

106
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:15,905
You're not going
to investigate it now?

107
00:08:15,941 --> 00:08:18,241
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

108
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,909
Because of my presence?

109
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:21,714
Well, there's no telling
what it may be.

110
00:08:25,093 --> 00:08:26,722
Please, Commander.

111
00:08:26,763 --> 00:08:28,665
I don't get out often.

112
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:34,233
Can you get a fix
on the source, Major?

113
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:38,811
.35 light years,
bearing 229, mark 41.

114
00:08:41,626 --> 00:08:44,154
I guess we'd better take a look.

115
00:08:50,444 --> 00:08:54,043
Well, this is definitely
the origin of the signal.

116
00:08:54,085 --> 00:08:57,057
I'm having trouble
pinpointing the source.

117
00:08:57,091 --> 00:08:59,654
It's not coming
from the surface.

118
00:09:02,534 --> 00:09:04,231
There's your answer.

119
00:09:04,271 --> 00:09:07,266
A network
of artificial satellites.

120
00:09:07,311 --> 00:09:10,181
One of them looks like
it's malfunctioning.

121
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,016
Its orbit is unstable.

122
00:09:12,054 --> 00:09:14,149
I'd bet the signals we picked up

123
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:16,627
were from the system
trying to repair it.

124
00:09:16,663 --> 00:09:19,635
Commander,
sensors indicate life-forms

125
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:22,232
localized
in 12 square kilometers

126
00:09:22,274 --> 00:09:24,005
on the moon's surface.

127
00:09:24,044 --> 00:09:26,071
They may be humanoid, sir.

128
00:09:26,182 --> 00:09:27,947
Humanoid?
Can you verify that?

129
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:30,251
I can't resolve
the bio-patterns.

130
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,317
There's too much interference.

131
00:09:32,361 --> 00:09:34,889
Take us in a little closer.

132
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:38,200
We're being scanned
by one of the satellites.

133
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:40,505
I don't like this.

134
00:09:40,544 --> 00:09:41,910
It's heading toward us.

135
00:09:41,946 --> 00:09:44,007
Shields up.

136
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,849
Reading a massive energy buildup
in the satellite.

137
00:09:45,887 --> 00:09:49,257
600 megawatts... 900.

138
00:09:49,295 --> 00:09:50,354
It's firing.

139
00:09:53,436 --> 00:09:54,904
Shields are down.

140
00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:57,740
Forward thrusters are gone.
We're losing power.

141
00:09:57,778 --> 00:10:00,146
Attempting to compensate
with secondary boosters.

142
00:10:00,217 --> 00:10:01,515
Impulse generator's failing.

143
00:10:01,552 --> 00:10:03,749
Hold on, we're going down.

144
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,457
Check contingency
fuel cell output.

145
00:10:07,498 --> 00:10:09,263
Holding at 65%.

146
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:10,326
Doctor...

147
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,169
- watch the hull temperature.
- Aye, sir.

148
00:10:12,274 --> 00:10:14,369
Stabilizing attitude
control response.

149
00:10:14,411 --> 00:10:15,937
Pitching up to 20 degrees.

150
00:10:15,981 --> 00:10:17,610
Hull temperature 900 C.

151
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:19,712
950, 1,100.

152
00:10:19,755 --> 00:10:21,520
We're holding profile.

153
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,027
1,200 C, 13...

154
00:10:23,061 --> 00:10:25,031
Ejecting antimatter pod.

155
00:10:25,065 --> 00:10:27,467
Pitching up to 60 degrees.

156
00:10:27,504 --> 00:10:29,736
Prepare for final
braking maneuvers.

157
00:10:29,775 --> 00:10:31,472
Brace for impact.

158
00:11:31,832 --> 00:11:32,959
Commander...

159
00:11:34,305 --> 00:11:35,773
Pulmonary collapse.

160
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,677
Her upper thoracic vertebrae
have been crushed.

161
00:11:38,713 --> 00:11:40,273
Stay with us, Opaka.
Stay with us.

162
00:11:52,341 --> 00:11:54,834
I'm sorry.

163
00:12:17,491 --> 00:12:21,761
<i>Ahn-kay ya...</i>

164
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:26,867
<i>ay-ya vasu.</i>

165
00:12:26,909 --> 00:12:30,075
<i>Coh-ma-ra...</i>

166
00:12:30,115 --> 00:12:33,053
<i>di-nay-ya.</i>

167
00:12:33,088 --> 00:12:36,060
<i>Ahn-kay ya...</i>

168
00:12:36,094 --> 00:12:37,323
<i>ay-ya vasu.</i>

169
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:39,333
We've got company.

170
00:12:53,463 --> 00:12:55,558
Still no contact with Sisko?

171
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,829
Not yet.

172
00:12:56,869 --> 00:12:58,839
They're nearly
three hours overdue.

173
00:12:58,873 --> 00:13:00,502
Three and a half.

174
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:03,606
Opaka's people are on subspace
to me every five minutes.

175
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,175
Tell them
one of our runabouts

176
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:07,155
found a trace
of a warp eddy current.

177
00:13:07,189 --> 00:13:08,818
It's got to be
from their ship.

178
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,489
With any luck, we should
be able to determine

179
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,793
which direction
they were headed.

180
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,461
That's not going
to satisfy them on Bajor.

181
00:13:13,503 --> 00:13:15,588
You have no idea
what the Kai means to them.

182
00:13:15,721 --> 00:13:18,659
When they heard Sisko had
taken her into the wormhole...

183
00:13:18,694 --> 00:13:20,926
Constable, tell them we're
doing the best we can, okay?

184
00:13:20,965 --> 00:13:22,594
Runabout Pad C.

185
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,336
Have the Bajorans station
a ship on the Gamma side.

186
00:13:26,376 --> 00:13:29,576
We'll stay in close touch
by subspace.

187
00:13:34,124 --> 00:13:35,592
Move.

188
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:44,068
Our first visitors.

189
00:13:44,144 --> 00:13:46,809
You're not all the same race.

190
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,820
I'm a Bajoran.

191
00:13:48,854 --> 00:13:50,790
I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko.

192
00:13:50,825 --> 00:13:53,695
Major Kira Nerys
and Doctor Julian Bashir.

193
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:55,496
A doctor?

194
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,738
How ironic.

195
00:13:58,774 --> 00:14:01,371
I'm Golin Shel-la,
leader of the Ennis.

196
00:14:01,413 --> 00:14:02,779
Why are you here?

197
00:14:02,815 --> 00:14:05,378
We were attacked
by one of your satellites

198
00:14:05,421 --> 00:14:07,050
Our ship was damaged,
and we crashed.

199
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:10,996
Of course, Commander,
but why did you come here?

200
00:14:11,031 --> 00:14:12,329
We were exploring.

201
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:14,304
We recently discovered
a permanent wormhole

202
00:14:14,338 --> 00:14:16,866
linking our quadrant
of the galaxy with yours.

203
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,711
I command a space station at
the mouth of that wormhole.

204
00:14:19,749 --> 00:14:21,981
You know nothing
of our home planet?

205
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,217
You know nothing
of the punishment?

206
00:14:24,258 --> 00:14:26,991
We're just beginning
to explore this sector.

207
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,193
As I said, our home is on
the other side of the gal...

208
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,204
Major.

209
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:32,206
I'm all right.

210
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,230
The hell you are.

211
00:14:35,313 --> 00:14:38,114
She needs treatment.

212
00:14:40,156 --> 00:14:42,490
I'd like my medical case

213
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:45,864
if you don't mind.

214
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,326
For God's sake!

215
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:11,117
I apologize
for our cautious nature.

216
00:15:11,185 --> 00:15:13,212
If you haven't realized,
we're at war.

217
00:15:13,256 --> 00:15:14,656
Who are you fighting?

218
00:15:14,692 --> 00:15:18,632
A brutal enemy
that attacks at whim.

219
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,662
We maintain a constant vigil.

220
00:15:21,706 --> 00:15:23,835
This is an energy weapon.

221
00:15:23,877 --> 00:15:25,345
Yes.

222
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,546
The Ennis stopped using
directed-energy weapons

223
00:15:28,587 --> 00:15:30,147
centuries ago...

224
00:15:30,256 --> 00:15:31,885
not damaging enough.

225
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:37,867
Your arrival
complicates matters.

226
00:15:37,905 --> 00:15:39,841
We don't plan to be here long.

227
00:15:39,876 --> 00:15:41,869
Oh, you expect
to repair your ship?

228
00:15:41,913 --> 00:15:45,512
No, but a rescue team is
probably on its way right now.

229
00:15:45,554 --> 00:15:46,647
Well, like you

230
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,421
they'll have to deal
with the defense-net

231
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,826
and that is beyond my influence.

232
00:15:49,862 --> 00:15:51,661
You don't control
the satellites?

233
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,501
We're all prisoners
on this moon.

234
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:56,941
Then, this is a penal colony.

235
00:15:56,977 --> 00:16:00,074
My immediate concern
is your partisanship.

236
00:16:00,116 --> 00:16:01,516
By your very presence here

237
00:16:01,553 --> 00:16:03,147
you'll be considered
our allies.

238
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:05,591
All your lives are in danger.

239
00:16:08,232 --> 00:16:10,829
The latest victims
of our enemy...

240
00:16:10,871 --> 00:16:12,271
the Nol-Ennis.

241
00:16:12,307 --> 00:16:14,038
Where are your doctors?

242
00:16:14,077 --> 00:16:15,545
We have none.

243
00:16:15,581 --> 00:16:17,676
You have no medical personnel?

244
00:16:17,718 --> 00:16:19,152
How do you survive without?

245
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,884
We were thrust
into this situation

246
00:16:20,924 --> 00:16:22,187
with few resources.

247
00:16:22,293 --> 00:16:24,160
Since you're here
under similar circumstances

248
00:16:24,197 --> 00:16:26,258
I was hoping we'd be
of some help to each other.

249
00:16:30,109 --> 00:16:32,945
This should make you
feel better.

250
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,921
Major...

251
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,836
I'm so sorry.

252
00:16:46,876 --> 00:16:49,643
I would have done anything.

253
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:54,454
It's all so senseless.

254
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,925
Opaka's always been
a symbol of hope to me.

255
00:17:02,608 --> 00:17:05,944
Her words gave
our struggle meaning.

256
00:17:08,954 --> 00:17:11,424
And now she's dead.

257
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,625
Her life ends
on some unknown moon...

258
00:17:18,974 --> 00:17:21,467
and for what?

259
00:17:21,512 --> 00:17:25,077
Dr. Bashir will give you
any medical assistance he can

260
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,523
but understand, we can't
take sides in your battle.

261
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,826
It doesn't matter
what I understand

262
00:17:30,864 --> 00:17:32,766
if the Nol capture you.

263
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,534
We're in the middle
of a pretty ugly war.

264
00:17:35,574 --> 00:17:37,065
I gathered that.

265
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,273
Shel-la says his people
will protect us from the enemy

266
00:17:39,314 --> 00:17:41,580
in exchange for your services.

267
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:43,282
Well, perhaps I can
train some of them

268
00:17:43,322 --> 00:17:44,620
in the basics of field triage.

269
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:45,627
Do whatever you can.

270
00:17:45,661 --> 00:17:47,027
How's the shoulder, Major?

271
00:17:47,063 --> 00:17:48,463
I'll live.

272
00:17:48,499 --> 00:17:50,298
I still have to run
a neuromuscular scan

273
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:51,463
on her when we get back.

274
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:53,668
Don't count on a quick rescue.

275
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,238
This moon is some kind
of high-security prison colony.

276
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,352
Over here!
Over here!

277
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,561
Major!

278
00:18:33,723 --> 00:18:35,249
Let's go!

279
00:18:35,293 --> 00:18:36,488
Leave him!

280
00:18:36,528 --> 00:18:37,757
Run!

281
00:19:01,713 --> 00:19:03,478
Commander!

282
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:10,062
Put your phaser down, Kira.

283
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,641
Her vital signs
appear to be normal

284
00:19:36,682 --> 00:19:38,675
but I could have sworn
she was...

285
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,383
I... I was there, Doctor.

286
00:19:40,423 --> 00:19:41,618
Opaka...

287
00:19:41,658 --> 00:19:43,389
are you aware of what happened?

288
00:19:46,836 --> 00:19:50,571
The surface was approaching
so quickly.

289
00:19:50,609 --> 00:19:52,408
I must admit, I...

290
00:19:52,513 --> 00:19:55,076
I closed my eyes, Commander.

291
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:57,920
There was a deafening whine.

292
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:01,192
I felt the impact.

293
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:04,567
A wall of heat seemed to...

294
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:06,369
pass through me.

295
00:20:08,746 --> 00:20:11,012
And... and then...

296
00:20:13,756 --> 00:20:15,365
nothing.

297
00:20:15,497 --> 00:20:18,492
After we crashed,
we pulled you from the wreckage

298
00:20:18,537 --> 00:20:20,097
but you were...

299
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,133
Dead.

300
00:20:39,913 --> 00:20:41,974
How do you explain this, Doctor?

301
00:20:42,017 --> 00:20:43,919
Although she appears
to be normal

302
00:20:43,955 --> 00:20:46,118
her physiology
has been radically altered.

303
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,149
How?

304
00:20:47,194 --> 00:20:48,287
I'm not sure.

305
00:20:48,396 --> 00:20:49,990
The tricorder indicates
some kind

306
00:20:50,033 --> 00:20:52,299
of biomechanical presence
at a cellular level.

307
00:20:52,404 --> 00:20:54,465
Biomechanical?
You mean something artificial?

308
00:20:54,509 --> 00:20:56,103
I wish I could tell you.

309
00:20:56,145 --> 00:20:57,842
Whatever it is, it seems to be

310
00:20:57,883 --> 00:21:00,514
directly controlling
her metabolic processes.

311
00:21:00,554 --> 00:21:02,114
Is she in any danger?

312
00:21:02,157 --> 00:21:04,093
I'm sorry to keep saying it,
Commander

313
00:21:04,128 --> 00:21:06,964
but I really don't know.

314
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:10,201
If the runabout's computer
were functional

315
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,044
I might be able to run
a full analysis.

316
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:15,710
Commander.

317
00:21:15,751 --> 00:21:17,380
Over here.

318
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,311
It's okay.
It's all right.

319
00:21:47,581 --> 00:21:49,312
There's still no sign of them

320
00:21:49,352 --> 00:21:51,345
on any
of the long-range scanners.

321
00:21:51,456 --> 00:21:53,585
Not even a transponder signal.

322
00:21:53,627 --> 00:21:55,529
If they went down,
we should at least

323
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,898
be getting something
from their transponder.

324
00:21:57,936 --> 00:22:00,965
The warp eddy has traces
of meson particle emissions.

325
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:02,979
That makes it
a Starfleet power reactor.

326
00:22:03,013 --> 00:22:05,108
The current shows
that their heading

327
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,983
was approximately 230 mark 4.

328
00:22:07,021 --> 00:22:08,820
Anything interesting
in that direction?

329
00:22:08,858 --> 00:22:11,796
An uncharted binary star system.

330
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:14,926
Well,
I guess it's time to chart it.

331
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:18,067
Setting a new course.

332
00:22:21,616 --> 00:22:24,247
His readings are
the same as Opaka's.

333
00:22:24,288 --> 00:22:26,087
Virtually every cell
in his body

334
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,858
shows signs
of this biomechanical presence.

335
00:22:28,898 --> 00:22:31,198
Now, somehow, it has literally
brought him back to life.

336
00:22:31,235 --> 00:22:32,795
You died before?

337
00:22:32,838 --> 00:22:35,240
Many times, too many to count.

338
00:22:35,277 --> 00:22:37,543
Sir, I'd like to return
to the runabout

339
00:22:37,581 --> 00:22:40,576
and try and get the computer
up and running.

340
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,817
Doctor, we're in the middle
of a war.

341
00:22:42,858 --> 00:22:44,258
Sir, this could be
a breakthrough

342
00:22:44,295 --> 00:22:45,524
of unprecedented magnitude.

343
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:46,998
It's too dangerous.

344
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:49,197
I'll see to his protection.

345
00:23:01,362 --> 00:23:05,632
I would like to know more about
this "breakthrough" myself.

346
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:08,972
Your doctor acts as though
he's seen a miracle.

347
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:10,640
He's not alone.

348
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,618
Well, if you'd lived
with it as we have

349
00:23:13,653 --> 00:23:16,146
you'd see it as a curse.

350
00:23:16,192 --> 00:23:18,321
How long have you been here?

351
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,856
It feels like an eternity.

352
00:23:20,902 --> 00:23:23,840
It's all part of the punishment.

353
00:23:25,343 --> 00:23:27,836
What is this punishment,
Shel-la?

354
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:31,514
Everything here is designed
to prolong our suffering.

355
00:23:31,556 --> 00:23:33,526
What was your crime?

356
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:39,801
The Ennis and the Nol-Ennis
are ancient enemies.

357
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,713
Generation after generation,
we fought the same war.

358
00:23:44,748 --> 00:23:48,209
The leaders of our planet
were unable to mediate a peace.

359
00:23:48,256 --> 00:23:50,453
Finally, they sent us all here

360
00:23:50,493 --> 00:23:53,192
and told us that we would serve
as an example

361
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:55,100
for the rest of civilization.

362
00:23:57,207 --> 00:23:59,370
How did your fight begin?

363
00:24:01,449 --> 00:24:03,419
Some say it was water.

364
00:24:03,453 --> 00:24:05,423
Some say it was land.

365
00:24:05,457 --> 00:24:07,723
It's not really
very relevant now.

366
00:24:07,761 --> 00:24:10,129
Then what do you hope to gain
by continuing?

367
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:11,692
Vengeance.

368
00:24:11,736 --> 00:24:14,867
All of us have seen
our families suffer incredibly

369
00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:16,708
at the hands of the Nol.

370
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,613
The Nol can say
the very same thing.

371
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,141
And probably do.

372
00:24:20,186 --> 00:24:22,588
If you must fight your war,
the least you can do

373
00:24:22,624 --> 00:24:24,218
is learn to fight it
more effectively.

374
00:24:24,261 --> 00:24:25,229
Major, this is not our...

375
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:26,629
What do you mean?

376
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,932
There were no guards
at the entrance when we arrived.

377
00:24:28,971 --> 00:24:31,966
You have no system to alert
your forces of an attack.

378
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,741
Your people are obviously
unprepared

379
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,214
for fighting close-quartered.

380
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,218
That's enough, Major.

381
00:24:36,252 --> 00:24:37,584
We're trapped on this moon

382
00:24:37,621 --> 00:24:39,215
with only his forces
between us and damnation.

383
00:24:39,258 --> 00:24:41,091
We have to defend
ourselves to stay alive.

384
00:24:41,128 --> 00:24:42,927
Now, when the Nol
attack again, we...

385
00:24:42,965 --> 00:24:43,933
I said that's enough!

386
00:24:43,967 --> 00:24:45,732
We have to be ready!

387
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,740
This is not your war, Kira.

388
00:24:49,712 --> 00:24:54,050
We used to defend
ourselves better, Major.

389
00:24:54,088 --> 00:24:56,753
Safety perimeters,
counterattacks

390
00:24:56,792 --> 00:24:58,557
preemptive strikes.

391
00:25:00,433 --> 00:25:03,405
And then we realized...

392
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:06,570
that it was all pointless.

393
00:25:09,785 --> 00:25:15,491
When you cease to fear death,
the rules of war change.

394
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:19,503
You'll understand as the years
begin to pass, Major.

395
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:22,338
Listen to me, Shel-la.

396
00:25:22,377 --> 00:25:25,372
Our rescue is not going
to take years.

397
00:25:25,417 --> 00:25:28,412
Days, weeks, maybe,
but they will find us

398
00:25:28,456 --> 00:25:31,189
and then they'll penetrate
the defense-net

399
00:25:31,228 --> 00:25:33,391
and transport us out of here.

400
00:25:33,433 --> 00:25:36,530
Then you will be luckier
than we have been.

401
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:39,975
We'd be willing to transport
all of you away from here

402
00:25:40,012 --> 00:25:41,811
if that's what you want.

403
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,821
Away from here?

404
00:25:47,861 --> 00:25:49,797
To live one life

405
00:25:49,832 --> 00:25:52,804
to die in peace...

406
00:25:52,838 --> 00:25:55,469
to us, this is
an ancient prayer

407
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:58,311
that has never been
answered, Commander.

408
00:26:02,157 --> 00:26:04,127
You would do this for us?

409
00:26:04,161 --> 00:26:05,459
For both sides...

410
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:07,490
the Ennis and the Nol-Ennis.

411
00:26:07,534 --> 00:26:08,968
After you leave

412
00:26:09,003 --> 00:26:11,269
you can go wherever you want,
but end this nightmare.

413
00:26:11,308 --> 00:26:13,005
Stop fighting long enough

414
00:26:13,044 --> 00:26:15,276
for all of us
to get off this moon.

415
00:26:15,316 --> 00:26:17,286
Zlangco, the leader of the Nol

416
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,914
would never agree
to a cease-fire.

417
00:26:18,956 --> 00:26:19,924
Ask him.

418
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:20,926
You don't know them!

419
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,053
All they care about is...

420
00:26:22,097 --> 00:26:23,292
What do you care about?

421
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:25,564
If you want to end
the suffering of your people

422
00:26:25,603 --> 00:26:28,234
then at least try.

423
00:26:28,276 --> 00:26:30,109
Set a meeting with this Zlangco.

424
00:26:30,146 --> 00:26:32,116
Talk about this.

425
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,360
This is hopeless.

426
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:41,027
But I will talk...

427
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:42,969
if he will.

428
00:26:57,534 --> 00:27:00,301
I'm not reading a single
M-Class planet in the system.

429
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,105
If they went down
anywhere around here

430
00:27:02,143 --> 00:27:03,167
they couldn't have survived.

431
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,167
I'm not sure we can believe
the scans, Chief.

432
00:27:05,204 --> 00:27:07,869
The star is putting out abnormal
levels of delta radiation.

433
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:10,813
That would foul up
our long-range scanners.

434
00:27:10,848 --> 00:27:14,082
We'll have to survey each planet
one at a time.

435
00:27:14,121 --> 00:27:17,891
Not to mention...
two dozen or so moons

436
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:20,195
and an asteroid belt.

437
00:27:20,234 --> 00:27:23,297
Bloody needle in a haystack.

438
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:27,110
A needle in a haystack.

439
00:27:27,148 --> 00:27:30,450
What we need is a magnet.

440
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,922
A magnet?

441
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:34,792
Yeah. You want to pick
your piece of metal

442
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:36,195
out of straw, you use a magnet.

443
00:27:36,233 --> 00:27:38,635
I don't think
I'm following you, Chief.

444
00:27:38,671 --> 00:27:41,666
Runabout hulls are made
of metallic composites

445
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:44,112
that interact
with magnetic fields.

446
00:27:44,148 --> 00:27:47,177
We could send out a few probes
to scan the system

447
00:27:47,221 --> 00:27:50,284
for those specific
magnetic resonance patterns.

448
00:27:50,328 --> 00:27:52,764
If Sisko's runabout
is in the system

449
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,260
we might pick up a fluctuation
in the hysteresis curve.

450
00:27:56,306 --> 00:27:57,501
The magnetic deflection

451
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,068
of a runabout's hull
is extremely weak.

452
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:00,808
The probes will never be
able to detect it.

453
00:28:00,848 --> 00:28:04,913
They will if I can outfit them
with a differential magnetomer.

454
00:28:04,956 --> 00:28:06,619
A differential magnetomer?

455
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,992
Mm-hmm.

456
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:10,056
I've never heard
of a differential magnetomer.

457
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,432
How does it work?

458
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:16,105
I'll let you know
as soon as I finish making one.

459
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,912
Nice work, Julian.

460
00:28:40,694 --> 00:28:41,992
I'm surprised.

461
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:45,161
Zlangco has agreed
to listen to your proposals.

462
00:28:45,203 --> 00:28:46,171
Good. When?

463
00:28:46,205 --> 00:28:47,366
Right away.

464
00:28:47,442 --> 00:28:49,742
We'll meet at a neutral site
near your vessel.

465
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:51,749
We've both agreed
to carry no firearms.

466
00:28:51,783 --> 00:28:54,185
What if they use the opportunity
to set a trap?

467
00:28:54,221 --> 00:28:56,749
We've taken the appropriate
precautions, Major

468
00:28:56,793 --> 00:28:58,888
but if you personally
would care

469
00:28:58,931 --> 00:29:01,528
to check the security,
I'm sure your Commander

470
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,631
would allow you
to accompany us...

471
00:29:03,674 --> 00:29:06,544
Major Kira will be staying here
with the Kai.

472
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:10,176
What a shame.

473
00:29:17,702 --> 00:29:19,763
You can't bury it, Kira.

474
00:29:22,244 --> 00:29:23,770
What?

475
00:29:23,814 --> 00:29:26,479
Do you recognize yourself
in these people?

476
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,922
Me?

477
00:29:28,957 --> 00:29:30,586
Oh, not...

478
00:29:30,628 --> 00:29:32,257
not at all, I...

479
00:29:32,298 --> 00:29:34,700
They're content to die.

480
00:29:34,736 --> 00:29:38,140
I've always fought
to stay alive.

481
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:42,242
Oh...

482
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:47,658
I don't want you to have

483
00:29:47,695 --> 00:29:50,188
the wrong impression
of me, Opaka.

484
00:29:54,742 --> 00:29:58,273
Just what impression
do you think I have?

485
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:01,748
That, that...

486
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:05,628
that I enjoy any of this.
I...

487
00:30:05,664 --> 00:30:08,329
I don't enjoy fighting.

488
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,203
Yes, I've...

489
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:13,143
I've fought my entire life,
but for a good cause.

490
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:15,274
For our freedom,
our independence.

491
00:30:15,317 --> 00:30:18,312
And it was... it was brutal
and ugly, and...

492
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,968
but that's over for me now.

493
00:30:26,005 --> 00:30:29,034
That's... that's not who I am.

494
00:30:32,752 --> 00:30:36,920
I-I don't want you to think
that I am this...

495
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,028
violent person without a soul,
without a conscience.

496
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,165
That is not who I am.

497
00:30:55,964 --> 00:30:57,455
Oh!

498
00:30:58,937 --> 00:31:02,707
Don't deny the violence
inside of you, Kira.

499
00:31:02,745 --> 00:31:06,810
Only when you accept it
can you move beyond it.

500
00:31:12,465 --> 00:31:16,769
I've known nothing but violence
since I was a child.

501
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:22,049
In the eyes of the Prophets

502
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:24,553
we're all children.

503
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:28,461
Bajor has much to learn
from peace.

504
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:35,165
I'm afraid the Prophets
won't forgive me.

505
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:41,012
They're just waiting
for you to forgive yourself.

506
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:54,144
22 minutes into launch.

507
00:31:54,181 --> 00:31:56,344
All readings
within normal parameters.

508
00:31:56,385 --> 00:31:59,016
Probe "B" approaching
planet six.

509
00:31:59,057 --> 00:32:00,525
Three moons.

510
00:32:00,561 --> 00:32:02,861
No change
in the hysteresis curve.

511
00:32:02,898 --> 00:32:05,334
Probe "C" approaching
planet seven.

512
00:32:07,474 --> 00:32:08,942
No change.

513
00:32:08,977 --> 00:32:12,108
What the hell would they
be doing here anyway?

514
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,277
It's a waste of time.

515
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:15,255
They could be
20 light-years from here

516
00:32:15,289 --> 00:32:18,261
and we wouldn't have
the first clue.

517
00:32:18,295 --> 00:32:21,233
Probe "A" approaching
planet three. One moon.

518
00:32:21,268 --> 00:32:23,738
Chief...

519
00:32:23,773 --> 00:32:27,234
Probe "A" measuring
a.0012 fluctuation

520
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,250
in the hysteresis curve.

521
00:32:29,284 --> 00:32:30,547
It's the third planet.

522
00:32:30,587 --> 00:32:32,284
No, look, it isn't.

523
00:32:32,323 --> 00:32:34,418
We're picking up something
from its moon.

524
00:32:34,462 --> 00:32:37,901
Laying in a new course,
full impulse.

525
00:33:02,417 --> 00:33:03,385
Any progress, Doctor?

526
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:04,614
Yes, sir.

527
00:33:04,722 --> 00:33:06,248
I've got the computer
up... more or less.

528
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:08,090
It's processing the data now.

529
00:33:08,128 --> 00:33:11,589
I can already confirm that
these microbes are artificial.

530
00:33:11,636 --> 00:33:13,435
Rather like nanites, in a way.

531
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,770
I should have
a complete analysis

532
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:16,209
from the computer
in a few minutes.

533
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,542
What's going on?

534
00:33:17,581 --> 00:33:19,015
Talks about a cease-fire.

535
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,109
No kidding?

536
00:33:20,152 --> 00:33:21,347
How did you arrange that?

537
00:33:21,388 --> 00:33:24,360
I told them we'd transport them
off this moon.

538
00:33:24,394 --> 00:33:26,626
Isn't that a bit like
assisting a jailbreak?

539
00:33:26,666 --> 00:33:28,066
I don't need you to interpret

540
00:33:28,102 --> 00:33:29,799
the Prime Directive
for me, Doctor.

541
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:31,273
Yes, sir, of course.
I only meant...

542
00:33:31,308 --> 00:33:32,640
Whatever crimes
they've committed

543
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:34,204
they've paid for
a hundred times over.

544
00:33:34,247 --> 00:33:35,807
They've been altered somehow

545
00:33:35,851 --> 00:33:37,684
and been abandoned
by their world.

546
00:33:37,721 --> 00:33:40,214
I believe the Federation
would recognize them

547
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:41,888
as separate and unique.

548
00:33:41,929 --> 00:33:44,457
Yes, sir.

549
00:33:44,501 --> 00:33:48,134
Well, I should be checking
on that analysis.

550
00:33:51,248 --> 00:33:52,716
So...

551
00:33:52,785 --> 00:33:56,121
you are the leader
of the aliens.

552
00:33:56,158 --> 00:33:59,597
Benjamin Sisko, Commander
of a Federation space station.

553
00:33:59,632 --> 00:34:00,930
Federation?

554
00:34:00,967 --> 00:34:02,937
What does it matter to us,
Zlangco?

555
00:34:02,971 --> 00:34:04,770
It matters to me.

556
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:05,859
The Federation is made up

557
00:34:05,992 --> 00:34:08,019
of over a hundred planets
who have allied themselves

558
00:34:08,063 --> 00:34:11,058
for mutual scientific, cultural
and defensive benefits.

559
00:34:11,102 --> 00:34:14,404
The mission my people and I
are on is to explore the galaxy.

560
00:34:14,442 --> 00:34:17,642
Such a noble purpose.

561
00:34:17,683 --> 00:34:20,587
There'll be no reward
for our release, you know.

562
00:34:20,622 --> 00:34:22,489
You are being a fool, as usual.

563
00:34:22,525 --> 00:34:25,053
A fool who always manages
to outwit you, Shel-la

564
00:34:25,097 --> 00:34:28,730
as I have proven,
over and over again.

565
00:34:28,771 --> 00:34:31,800
You care to die once again,
all you need to do is ask.

566
00:34:31,844 --> 00:34:34,110
If you've had enough of this

567
00:34:34,148 --> 00:34:37,552
then make your leaders
stop and listen.

568
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:41,996
Your only reason to live is
to make each other suffer.

569
00:34:42,031 --> 00:34:44,696
If you've had enough
of suffering

570
00:34:44,737 --> 00:34:46,707
then make them stop.

571
00:34:46,741 --> 00:34:49,143
I'm not here to be a mediator

572
00:34:49,178 --> 00:34:51,775
but if you ask
for an alternative

573
00:34:51,817 --> 00:34:53,446
I'll give you one.

574
00:34:53,487 --> 00:34:55,423
We're listening.

575
00:34:55,457 --> 00:34:59,363
In a matter of days,
when our rescue party arrives

576
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:02,964
I can arrange
to transport you and your people

577
00:35:03,006 --> 00:35:06,707
off this moon,
if both sides can only cooperate

578
00:35:06,747 --> 00:35:08,546
until then.

579
00:35:08,583 --> 00:35:13,389
Zlangco, they will resettle us
on different planets.

580
00:35:13,427 --> 00:35:15,226
If that's what you wish.

581
00:35:15,297 --> 00:35:18,633
The two of you seem to have
discussed this plan in detail.

582
00:35:18,671 --> 00:35:20,003
Of course.

583
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,839
His crew has been with us
for two days.

584
00:35:21,877 --> 00:35:25,783
Explain why you chose to ally
yourself with the Ennis.

585
00:35:25,819 --> 00:35:27,652
We have allied ourselves
with no one.

586
00:35:27,689 --> 00:35:29,750
One of your people
fired a weapon at us.

587
00:35:29,793 --> 00:35:33,232
We were defending ourselves.

588
00:35:33,266 --> 00:35:35,634
I think you're lying.

589
00:35:35,672 --> 00:35:37,835
I don't know the alien

590
00:35:37,876 --> 00:35:39,037
but I know Shel-la.

591
00:35:39,078 --> 00:35:40,707
I know how his mind works.

592
00:35:40,748 --> 00:35:44,813
I promise you,
this is an Ennis trick

593
00:35:44,857 --> 00:35:47,123
to lure our entire
population out of hiding

594
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:48,527
so they can be slaughtered.

595
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,861
That's not true!

596
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:54,300
Then the Ennis
are surely willing

597
00:35:54,408 --> 00:35:56,674
to make the first
gesture of peace.

598
00:35:56,714 --> 00:35:59,880
Let them bring all of their
people out of hiding first

599
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,288
to prove their
honorable intentions.

600
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:10,128
Do you think
that I would allow

601
00:36:10,174 --> 00:36:14,980
a single Nol to escape
this planet alive?!

602
00:36:15,017 --> 00:36:18,456
No more than I would
let an Ennis go free.

603
00:36:25,805 --> 00:36:26,830
Ah!

604
00:37:00,307 --> 00:37:01,867
I'm sorry, Commander

605
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:04,746
but I've discovered
we can't afford to die here...

606
00:37:04,783 --> 00:37:06,274
not even once.

607
00:37:15,905 --> 00:37:19,504
It's some kind
of artificial satellite system.

608
00:37:19,545 --> 00:37:21,242
That's what our probe
must have picked up.

609
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:22,341
Our sensors are reading

610
00:37:22,451 --> 00:37:23,783
life-forms on the surface,
Chief.

611
00:37:23,821 --> 00:37:25,119
I think some of them
are human.

612
00:37:25,157 --> 00:37:26,523
If the ship's down there

613
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:29,292
why wouldn't the transponder
be sending out a?

614
00:37:29,332 --> 00:37:30,322
We're being scanned.

615
00:37:30,367 --> 00:37:32,337
Increasing orbital altitude.

616
00:37:32,371 --> 00:37:34,170
What are you thinking?

617
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:37,009
Well, the only thing that could
block out a transponder signal

618
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,515
is a broadband damping field.

619
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:41,351
That requires a low-level
satellite system, like this one.

620
00:37:41,389 --> 00:37:44,122
Suddenly, we're being scanned
by those satellites, so...

621
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:47,361
Maybe they had something to do
with our missing runabout.

622
00:37:47,401 --> 00:37:49,929
Exactly. See?

623
00:37:49,973 --> 00:37:52,604
They're putting out
a mutual induction field

624
00:37:52,644 --> 00:37:55,275
that would block out 99%
of all transmissions

625
00:37:55,317 --> 00:37:56,877
to and from the surface.

626
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,790
Is there any way for us to get
a com line through the field?

627
00:37:59,826 --> 00:38:03,664
Well, I've got one percent
to work with, don't I?

628
00:38:25,677 --> 00:38:27,510
The analysis is very clear.

629
00:38:27,548 --> 00:38:30,111
Once the microbes
have restored a body after death

630
00:38:30,153 --> 00:38:32,646
that body then becomes
permanently dependent on them

631
00:38:32,691 --> 00:38:34,057
for all cellular functions.

632
00:38:34,094 --> 00:38:35,119
Permanently?

633
00:38:35,163 --> 00:38:36,426
It gets worse.

634
00:38:36,466 --> 00:38:38,527
The designers made them
environment specific.

635
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:41,872
If the microbes are removed
from this ecosystem

636
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,573
they'll stop functioning.

637
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:46,106
So, if we transport
anyone off this planet

638
00:38:46,152 --> 00:38:48,088
we kill them.

639
00:38:48,122 --> 00:38:50,319
I'm afraid so.

640
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,227
The Kai?

641
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:57,671
<i>Rio Grande</i> to Sisko.

642
00:38:57,708 --> 00:38:58,676
Do you read me?

643
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,201
This is O'Brien.
Come in.

644
00:39:00,247 --> 00:39:01,876
Go ahead, Chief.
I can barely read you.

645
00:39:01,917 --> 00:39:03,887
Is everyone all right?

646
00:39:03,921 --> 00:39:07,382
We're alive, but the <i>Yangtzee</i>
<i>Kiang</i> was destroyed.

647
00:39:07,427 --> 00:39:08,895
Will you be able to beam us up?

648
00:39:08,931 --> 00:39:10,798
Not quite yet, Commander.

649
00:39:10,834 --> 00:39:12,428
We've got to find
a way to penetrate

650
00:39:12,538 --> 00:39:13,767
this network of satellites.

651
00:39:13,806 --> 00:39:15,035
They're making it impossible
for us

652
00:39:15,076 --> 00:39:16,305
to lock on to anything
down there.

653
00:39:16,345 --> 00:39:17,438
Understood.

654
00:39:17,548 --> 00:39:19,541
But those satellites
will come after you

655
00:39:19,585 --> 00:39:20,951
if you get too close.

656
00:39:20,988 --> 00:39:22,422
They're armed.

657
00:39:22,457 --> 00:39:24,586
One of them cut us down
without any trouble at all.

658
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:26,062
Yeah, we figured as much.

659
00:39:26,098 --> 00:39:28,466
Let me know before you're
ready to make an attempt.

660
00:39:28,503 --> 00:39:30,496
Acknowledged. <i>Rio Grande</i> out.

661
00:39:33,313 --> 00:39:35,647
We have to talk to the Kai.

662
00:39:42,999 --> 00:39:44,628
Is there a cease-fire?

663
00:39:44,668 --> 00:39:46,797
Neither side took it seriously.

664
00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:48,775
I'm not at all surprised.

665
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,643
You were right, Kira.

666
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,141
They don't know how to do
anything else but die.

667
00:39:54,188 --> 00:39:56,317
They've forgotten how to live.

668
00:39:56,359 --> 00:39:58,852
The <i>Rio Grande</i> has made contact.

669
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,661
Dax and O'Brien are in orbit.

670
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,970
They're working on a way
to penetrate the defense system.

671
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:07,982
I'll be staying, Commander.

672
00:40:08,016 --> 00:40:09,645
What?

673
00:40:09,685 --> 00:40:12,248
This is the answer
to all the prophecies

674
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:13,519
of my life.

675
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:14,857
It's the wrong answer, Opaka.

676
00:40:14,895 --> 00:40:16,193
You can't stay here.

677
00:40:16,232 --> 00:40:18,532
I didn't know how or why,
but when we came

678
00:40:18,569 --> 00:40:22,509
through the wormhole,
I knew I wouldn't be returning.

679
00:40:22,544 --> 00:40:24,844
You must tell our people, Kira

680
00:40:24,882 --> 00:40:28,377
that I have answered the call
of the Prophets.

681
00:40:28,423 --> 00:40:31,293
I was brought here
because it is time

682
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:35,029
for these people
to begin their healing process

683
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:37,404
just as you were brought here

684
00:40:37,441 --> 00:40:40,607
to begin yours.

685
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,875
You know, all we really
need to do is find a way

686
00:40:42,918 --> 00:40:45,252
to create a gap in the net.

687
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:48,421
Maybe a photon would destroy
one of the satellites.

688
00:40:48,463 --> 00:40:51,026
Maybe, but you think they'd
build a defense network

689
00:40:51,068 --> 00:40:52,434
with that in mind.

690
00:40:52,471 --> 00:40:55,375
You shoot one,
the rest might swarm up

691
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,744
like Vayan horn flies.

692
00:41:00,253 --> 00:41:03,714
We need to go
for something simpler.

693
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,732
All I need is
about a 15% increase

694
00:41:06,766 --> 00:41:09,100
in the opening in the net.

695
00:41:14,782 --> 00:41:16,250
<i>Rio Grande</i> to Sisko.

696
00:41:16,285 --> 00:41:17,753
Go ahead, Chief.

697
00:41:17,788 --> 00:41:19,771
We're going to try
to poke a hole up here, sir.

698
00:41:19,904 --> 00:41:22,306
If you're about ready
to end your stay.

699
00:41:22,343 --> 00:41:24,472
Only three of us
are coming back.

700
00:41:24,514 --> 00:41:26,177
Kai Opaka is remaining.

701
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:28,186
Benjamin, please confirm.

702
00:41:28,255 --> 00:41:31,159
Did you say we're not
transporting the Kai?

703
00:41:31,194 --> 00:41:33,825
That's correct.
I'll explain later.

704
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,529
We need a few minutes,
Commander.

705
00:41:35,569 --> 00:41:36,901
<i>Rio Grande</i> out.

706
00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:41,408
Leaving without us?

707
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,688
My analysis of these microbes
that keep you alive

708
00:41:45,723 --> 00:41:47,852
showed that if you were
to leave this moon

709
00:41:47,894 --> 00:41:49,055
you would die.

710
00:41:49,097 --> 00:41:52,228
Then there is no end.

711
00:41:53,305 --> 00:41:55,241
Commander...

712
00:41:55,309 --> 00:41:57,677
I find myself caught
in a moral dilemma.

713
00:41:57,713 --> 00:42:01,813
As much as I am dedicated
to the preservation of life

714
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,757
I wonder if we shouldn't
help these people

715
00:42:03,792 --> 00:42:05,192
put an end to this torture.

716
00:42:05,229 --> 00:42:06,527
How could you do that?

717
00:42:06,564 --> 00:42:08,158
Anything that can be programmed

718
00:42:08,201 --> 00:42:09,294
can be reprogrammed.

719
00:42:09,337 --> 00:42:10,464
If I could disable

720
00:42:10,506 --> 00:42:12,476
the mechanism
in these microbes

721
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:15,003
they should no longer function
when someone is killed

722
00:42:15,049 --> 00:42:17,212
and these people would
finally be able to die.

723
00:42:20,392 --> 00:42:22,862
You've seen our life here.

724
00:42:22,897 --> 00:42:25,869
Please, it's
the only solution left.

725
00:42:25,903 --> 00:42:28,875
You give us a way
to reprogram these microbes

726
00:42:28,909 --> 00:42:31,379
and we'll put an end
to this war.

727
00:42:31,414 --> 00:42:34,716
You really think the fear of
death will end the fighting?

728
00:42:34,754 --> 00:42:36,781
Never has in any other war.

729
00:42:36,825 --> 00:42:40,059
No.

730
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,569
But it will allow us
to finally win

731
00:42:42,603 --> 00:42:44,971
to wipe out the Nol for good.

732
00:42:45,008 --> 00:42:47,844
On this world, Doctor

733
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,284
your disabled microbes
would be the ultimate weapon.

734
00:42:51,354 --> 00:42:55,658
We could finally
and truly destroy our enemies!

735
00:42:55,696 --> 00:42:57,723
<i>Rio Grande</i> to Sisko.

736
00:42:57,767 --> 00:42:59,760
Stand by for transport.

737
00:43:04,247 --> 00:43:05,715
Ready.

738
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,049
Coordinates set.

739
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:09,887
Launching probe.

740
00:43:09,924 --> 00:43:12,360
12 seconds to intercept.

741
00:43:12,396 --> 00:43:14,924
Go on, go on, go for it.

742
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,530
One of the satellites
is breaking orbit

743
00:43:17,573 --> 00:43:19,041
moving toward the probe.

744
00:43:19,076 --> 00:43:20,807
That's it.

745
00:43:20,846 --> 00:43:24,616
The satellite is showing
a power buildup...

746
00:43:24,654 --> 00:43:26,681
about 800 megawatts.

747
00:43:28,695 --> 00:43:30,528
Probe destroyed.

748
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,160
<i>Rio Grande</i> to Sisko.

749
00:43:32,203 --> 00:43:34,298
Trying to lock on, Commander.

750
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,831
Establishing pattern lock.

751
00:43:35,876 --> 00:43:38,278
You can't leave
without giving us...

752
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:40,581
Energize when ready, Chief.

753
00:43:51,106 --> 00:43:55,444
Opaka, if we can
ever find a way...

754
00:43:55,482 --> 00:43:58,943
My work is here now, Commander.

755
00:44:03,798 --> 00:44:08,433
But your power and mine...

756
00:44:08,475 --> 00:44:11,242
will cross again.

757
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:20,930
Energizing.
