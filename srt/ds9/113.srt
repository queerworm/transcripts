1
00:00:01,543 --> 00:00:03,712
What's funny is where
the files were located--

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:05,923
right there
in Ops protocols.

3
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:08,216
The encryption system
was extremely easy to break.

4
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,093
SISKO:
So, they wanted us
to find these?

5
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,471
DAX:
Or they didn't care.

6
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,849
Well, there's nothing
of strategic value here--

7
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,099
just some personal logs

8
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,602
and some files on
Bajoran terrorists,

9
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:21,355
but it is a glimpse
into the Cardassian mind.

10
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,107
You might want to warn Kira
before she sees her file.

11
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:27,778
Warn me?
About what?

12
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,155
Oh, uh...
Dax and Mr. O'Brien

13
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:33,450
discovered some of the last
Prefect's personal files.

14
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,160
There's a file on you,

15
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,371
but you may find it
disappointing.

16
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,331
I'm a big girl, Commander.

17
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,179
<i>Bashir to Sisko.</i>

18
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,305
Sisko here.

19
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:56,891
<i>I'm at Airlock 14, Commander.</i>

20
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,726
<i>I think you better</i>
<i>get down here.</i>

21
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,185
What's the problem, Doctor?

22
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,770
Well, I was about to begin
off-loading

23
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,981
some medical specimens
from the Bajoran transport

24
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:05,524
<i>and, well...</i>

25
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,943
<i>the Kai is here.</i>

26
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,654
Kai... Opaka.

27
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,280
Why would she be here?

28
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:16,201
<i>She said you once offered her</i>
<i>a tour of the station.</i>

29
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,664
"A<i> minor</i> operative

30
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:23,667
"whose activities are limited
to running<i> errands</i>

31
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,252
for the terrorist leaders"?!

32
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,379
Major, when you're through
feeling underappreciated

33
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:30,549
perhaps you'd join me in
welcoming the Kai aboard.

34
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,109
You say she's
never been here before?

35
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,737
She's never even left
Bajor before.

36
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,447
Well, excuse me
for saying so, Commander,

37
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,033
but she looks...
preoccupied.

38
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:12,841
Is something
wrong, Opaka?

39
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,176
Contemplating prophecy.

40
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,891
It's interesting you
chose this viewport.

41
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,310
The wormhole is
just out there.

42
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,604
It's a spectacular
sight to see.

43
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,815
Unfortunately,
it can only be seen

44
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,858
when a ship enters it
or exits,

45
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,111
but there's nothing
scheduled for today.

46
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,947
A shame.

47
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,829
Sisko to O'Brien.

48
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,246
<i>Go ahead, Commander.</i>

49
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,957
Prepare the<i> Yangtzee Kiang</i>
for launch, Chief.

50
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:45,958
Kira and I are taking

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,918
the Kai through
the wormhole.

52
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,210
<i>Right away, sir.</i>

53
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,212
Thank you.

54
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,051
I didn't want
to keep you

55
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,218
from your duties,
Doctor.

56
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,471
Oh, it's a slow day.

57
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,556
All right.
This way.

58
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,742
Is the ship ready, Chief?

59
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,077
All prepped and
ready for departure

60
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,244
Commander.

61
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,454
Ma'am.

62
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:25,789
After you.

63
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,882
You have a child,
don't you?

64
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,551
I do, ma'am.
I have a little
girl, ma'am.

65
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,178
Yes.

66
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,643
Would you give this
to her for me?

67
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,216
We'll be entering
the wormhole

68
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:23,591
in about a minute.

69
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,677
Thank you again
for indulging me.

70
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,221
Not at all,
Opaka.

71
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,930
You honor us with
your presence.

72
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,516
<i>Yangtzee Kiang</i> to DS9.

73
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,102
Estimated time of
return, 1400 hours.

74
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,021
DAX:
<i>Logged in.</i>
<i>We'll expect you then.</i>

75
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,232
Flight stabilization
at maximum.

76
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,776
Here we go.

77
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,920
Spectacular,
isn't it?

78
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,420
More than I imagined.

79
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:04,423
My smoothest ride yet, Major.

80
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:07,135
There's Idran,
the closest system.

81
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,595
It's a ternary star.

82
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,847
A doorway into the unknown.

83
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,849
The other side of the galaxy,
to be precise.

84
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,727
The Gamma Quadrant is 70,000
light years from Bajor.

85
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,687
It would take our
fastest starship

86
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,232
over 67 years
to get here.

87
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,442
I'm glad I got the chance
to see it.

88
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,444
You'll be seeing
what this wormhole

89
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,863
is worth to Bajor
in a few years.

90
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:32,535
If that is to be
my fate, Commander.

91
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,703
Should I reverse course?

92
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,622
So soon?

93
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,541
There's not much else
to show you yet.

94
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,044
Prophecy can often be vague,
Commander.

95
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,879
That's why we must test it.

96
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,426
I don't understand, Opaka.

97
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:54,308
You may return.

98
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,934
Take us back
to the wormhole, Major.

99
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,312
Coming about.

100
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:01,440
Sensors are picking up
a narrow band subspace signal.

101
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,775
What do you make of it?

102
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,693
Just a long stream
of statistical data

103
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,947
followed by a request
for a reply.

104
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,116
Uh, I'm not reading
any response.

105
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,994
Launch a class-2 probe.
We'll follow it up later.

106
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,579
You're not going to
investigate it now?

107
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,206
I'm not sure
that's a good idea.

108
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,499
Because of my presence?

109
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,126
Well, there's no telling
what it may be.

110
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,256
Please, Commander.

111
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,091
I don't get out often.

112
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,220
Can you get a fix
on the source, Major?

113
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:38,352
.35 light years,
bearing 229, mark 41.

114
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,564
I guess we'd better
take a look.

115
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:54,034
Well, this is definitely
the origin of the signal.

116
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,119
I'm having trouble
pinpointing the source.

117
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,497
It's not coming
from the surface.

118
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,211
SISKO: There's your answer.

119
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,338
A network
of artificial satellites.

120
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,841
One of them looks like
it's malfunctioning.

121
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,219
Its orbit is unstable.

122
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,137
I'd bet the signals
we picked up

123
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,722
were from the system
trying to repair it.

124
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:19,226
Commander,
sensors indicate life-forms

125
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,061
localized
in 12 square kilometers

126
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,730
on the moon's surface.

127
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,273
They may be humanoid, sir.

128
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,941
Humanoid?
Can you verify that?

129
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:30,070
I can't resolve
the bio-patterns.

130
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,406
There's too much interference.

131
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:35,158
Take us in a little closer.

132
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,327
We're being scanned
by one of the satellites.

133
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,620
I don't like this.

134
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,081
It's heading toward us.

135
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,499
Shields up.

136
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,585
Reading a massive energy
buildup in the satellite.

137
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,338
600 megawatts... 900.

138
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,756
It's firing.

139
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,553
Shields are down.

140
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,679
Forward thrusters are gone.
We're losing power.

141
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,266
Attempting to compensate
with secondary boosters.

142
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,184
Impulse generator's failing.

143
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:04,312
Hold on, we're going down.

144
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,565
Check contingency
fuel cell output.

145
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,608
Holding at 65%.

146
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,776
Doctor...

147
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,319
watch the hull
temperature.
Aye, sir.

148
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,405
Stabilizing attitude
control response.

149
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,031
Pitching up to 20 degrees.

150
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:16,657
Hull temperature 900 C.

151
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,743
950, 1,100.

152
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,495
We're holding profile.

153
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:23,164
1,200 C, 13...

154
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,916
Ejecting antimatter pod.

00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,376
KIRA:
Pitching up
to 60 degrees.

156
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,836
Prepare for final
braking maneuvers.

157
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,671
SISKO: Brace for impact.

(<i> frantic gasping</i> )

161
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:34,861
Pulmonary collapse.

162
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,446
Her upper thoracic vertebrae
have been crushed.

163
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:39,073
Stay with us, Opaka.
Stay with us.

164
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:42,410

We've got company.

176
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,275
Still no contact with Sisko?

177
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,526
Not yet.

178
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,361
They're nearly
three hours overdue.

179
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,029
Three and a half.

180
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:03,116
Opaka's people are
on subspace to me
every five minutes.

181
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,409
Tell them
one of our runabouts

182
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,411
found a trace
of a warp eddy current.

183
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:07,870
It's got to be
from their ship.

184
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,456
With any luck, we should
be able to determine

185
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,124
which direction
they were headed.

186
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,667
ODO:
Oh, that's not going
to satisfy them on Bajor.

187
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,753
You have no idea
what the Kai
means to them.

188
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,755
When they heard Sisko had
taken her into the wormhole...

189
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:20,216
Constable, tell them we're
doing the best we can, okay?

190
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,135
Runabout Pad C.

191
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,554
Have the Bajorans station
a ship on the Gamma side.

192
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:27,098
We'll stay in close touch
by subspace.

193
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,231
Move.

194
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,948
MALE:
Our first visitors.

195
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,451
You're not all the same race.

196
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,035
I'm a Bajoran.

197
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,037
I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko.

198
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,957
Major Kira Nerys
and Doctor Julian Bashir.

199
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,542
A doctor?

200
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,921
How ironic.

201
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,048
I'm Golin Shel-la,
leader of the Ennis.

202
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,342
Why are you here?

203
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,802
We were attacked by
one of your satellites.

204
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:06,262
Our ship was damaged,
and we crashed.

205
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:10,224
Of course, Commander,
but why did you come<i> here?</i>

206
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,850
We were exploring.

207
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,687
We recently discovered
a permanent wormhole

208
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,938
linking our quadrant
of the galaxy with yours.

209
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,775
I command a space station at
the mouth of that wormhole.

210
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,319
You know nothing
of our home planet?

211
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,404
You know nothing
of the punishment?

212
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,281
We're just beginning
to explore this sector.

213
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,408
As I said, our home is on
the other side of the gal...

214
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,576
(<i> groans</i> )

215
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:29,661
Major.

216
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:30,829
I'm all right.

217
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,497
The hell you are.

218
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,293
She needs treatment.

219
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,382
I'd like my
medical case

220
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,009
if you don't mind.

221
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,903
For God's sake!

222
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:10,159
SHEL-LA:
I apologize
for our cautious nature.

223
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,370
If you haven't realized,
we're at war.

224
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,747
Who are you fighting?

225
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:17,166
A brutal enemy
that attacks at whim.

226
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,460
We maintain
a constant vigil.

227
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,297
This is an energy weapon.

228
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,674
Yes.

229
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,967
The Ennis stopped using
directed-energy weapons

230
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,887
centuries ago--

231
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,805
not damaging enough.

232
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,978
Your arrival
complicates matters.

233
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,564
We don't plan
to be here long.

234
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,816
Oh, you expect to
repair your ship?

235
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,944
No, but a rescue team is
probably on its way right now.

236
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,280
Well, like you
they'll have to deal
with the defense-net

237
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,031
and that is beyond
my influence.

238
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,367
You don't control
the satellites?

239
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:54,078
We're all prisoners
on this moon.

240
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,289
Then, this is
a penal colony.

241
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,333
My immediate concern
is your partisanship.

242
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,169
By your very presence here
you'll be considered
our allies.

243
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,422
All your lives
are in danger.

244
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,969
The latest victims
of our enemy--

245
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,721
the Nol-Ennis.

246
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:12,764
Where are your doctors?

247
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,682
We have none.

248
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,143
You have no
medical personnel?

249
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,603
How do you survive
without...?

250
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,020
We were thrust
into this situation

251
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,481
with few resources.

252
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,149
Since you're here
under similar circumstances

253
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,610
I was hoping we'd be
of some help to each other.

254
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,241
This should make
you feel better.

255
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:40,750
Major...

256
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,212
I'm so sorry.

257
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,090
I would have
done anything.

258
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,471
It's all so senseless.

259
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:59,602
Opaka's always been
a symbol of hope to me.

260
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,482
Her words gave
our struggle meaning.

261
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,904
And now she's dead.

262
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:15,451
Her life ends
on some unknown moon...

263
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,622
and for what?

264
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,293
Dr. Bashir will give you
any medical assistance he can,

265
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,671
but understand, we can't
take sides in your battle.

266
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,756
It doesn't matter
what I understand

267
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,925
if the Nol capture you.

268
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,054
We're in the middle
of a pretty ugly war.

269
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,764
I gathered that.

270
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,265
SISKO:
Shel-la says his people
will protect us from the enemy

271
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,476
in exchange
for your services.

272
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:41,895
Well, perhaps I can
train some of them

273
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,187
in the basics
of field triage.

274
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,772
Do whatever
you can.

275
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,315
How's the shoulder,
Major?

276
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:47,650
I'll live.

277
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,276
I still have to run
a neuromuscular scan

278
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,444
on her when we get back.

279
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,071
Don't count
on a quick rescue.

280
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,949
This moon is some kind
of high-security prison colony.

281
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,576
(<i> explosion</i> )

282
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,077
(<i> people exclaiming</i> )

283
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,913
(<i> people yelling</i> )

284
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,545
(<i> yells</i> )

285
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,926
(<i> yells</i> )

286
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,886
SOLDIER 1: Over here!
Over here!

287
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,893
(<i> screaming</i> )

288
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:24,771
Major!

289
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,321
SOLDIER 2: Let's go!

290
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,074
Leave him!

291
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,324
Run!

292
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,791
(<i> moaning</i> )

293
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:01,933
WOMAN: Commander!

294
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,230
Put your phaser down, Kira.

295
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,175
Her vital signs
appear to be normal,

296
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,551
but I could
have sworn she was...

297
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,553
I... I was
there, Doctor.

298
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,638
Opaka...

299
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,348
are you aware of what happened?

300
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:48,980
The surface was approaching
so quickly.

301
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,982
I must admit, I...

302
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,109
I closed my eyes, Commander.

303
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,821
There was a deafening whine.

304
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,115
I-I felt the impact.

305
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:02,035
A wall of heat seemed to...

306
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,038
pass through me.

307
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,667
And... and then...

308
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,881
nothing.

309
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,800
After we crashed, we pulled you
from the wreckage,

310
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,886
but you were...

311
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,470
Dead.

312
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,574
SISKO:
How do you explain
this, Doctor?

313
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,076
Although she appears
to be normal,

314
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,244
her physiology
has been radically altered.

315
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,413
How?
I'm not sure.

316
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,123
The tricorder indicates
some kind

317
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,625
of biomechanical presence
at a cellular level.

318
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,794
Biomechanical? You mean
something artificial?

319
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,295
I wish I could tell you.

320
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,048
Whatever it is,
it seems to be

321
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,800
directly controlling
her metabolic processes.

322
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,301
Is she in any danger?

323
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,803
I'm sorry to keep saying it,
Commander,

324
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,513
but I really don't know.

325
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:10,310
If the runabout's computer
were functional,

326
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,313
I might be able to run
a full analysis.

327
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,233
Commander.

328
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,650
Over here.

329
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,574
(<i> weak groaning</i> )

330
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,954
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

331
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,123
BASHIR:
It's okay.
It's all right.

332
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,141
There's still no sign
of them

333
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:50,517
on any of
the long-range scanners.

334
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,478
Not even a transponder signal.

335
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,980
If they went down,
we should at least

336
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,816
be getting something
from their transponder.

337
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,819
The warp eddy has
traces of meson
particle emissions.

338
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,862
That makes it
a Starfleet power reactor.

339
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,281
The current shows
that their heading

340
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,825
was approximately 230 mark 4.

341
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,701
Anything interesting
in that direction?

342
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,663
An uncharted
binary star system.

343
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,874
Well,
I guess it's time to chart it.

344
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:17,253
Setting a new course.

345
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,926
BASHIR:
His readings are
the same as Opaka's.

346
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,636
Virtually every cell
in his body

347
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,888
shows signs of this
biomechanical presence.

348
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,474
Now, somehow, it has literally
brought him back to life.

349
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:31,809
You died before?

350
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:35,021
Many times,
too many to count.

351
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,940
Sir, I'd like to return
to the runabout

352
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,566
and try and get the computer
up and running.

353
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,277
Doctor, we're in the middle
of a war.

354
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,653
Sir, this could be
a breakthrough

355
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,322
of unprecedented magnitude.

356
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:45,948
It's too dangerous.

357
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,034
I'll see to
his protection.

358
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:05,259
I would like to know more about
this "breakthrough" myself.

359
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:08,012
Your doctor acts as though
he's seen a miracle.

360
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,429
He's not alone.

361
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:13,142
Well, if you'd lived
with it as we have,

362
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,853
you'd see it
as a curse.

363
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,395
SISKO: How long have you
been here?

364
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:20,566
It feels like
an eternity.

365
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,818
It's all part
of the punishment.

366
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,780
What is this punishment,
Shel-la?

367
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:30,701
Everything here is designed
to prolong our suffering.

368
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,578
What was your crime?

369
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:38,918
The Ennis and the Nol-Ennis
are ancient enemies.

370
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:42,796
Generation after generation,
we fought the same war.

371
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:47,760
The leaders of our planet
were unable to mediate a peace.

372
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,511
Finally, they sent us all here

373
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,847
and told us that we would serve
as an example

374
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:54,016
for the rest of civilization.

375
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:58,354
How did your fight begin?

376
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:03,734
Some say it was water.
Some say it was land.

377
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,904
It's not really
very relevant now.

378
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,948
Then what do you hope to gain
by continuing?

379
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,200
Vengeance.

380
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:14,161
All of us have seen
our families suffer incredibly

381
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,704
at the hands of the Nol.

382
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,539
The Nol can say
the very same thing.

383
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,292
And probably do.

384
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,085
If you must
fight your war,

385
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:23,503
the least you can do
is learn to fight it
more effectively.

386
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,214
Major, this
is not our...
What do you mean?

387
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,925
There were no guards
at the entrance
when we arrived.

388
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,093
You have no system

389
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,844
to alert your forces
of an attack.

390
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,554
Your people are obviously
unprepared

391
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,098
for fighting close-quartered.

392
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,849
That's enough, Major.
We're trapped
on this moon

393
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,977
with only his forces
between us and damnation.

394
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,062
We have to defend
ourselves to stay alive.

395
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,355
Now, when the Nol
attack again, we...

396
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:42,773
I said that's enough!

397
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,108
We have to be ready!

398
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,444
This is not
your war, Kira.

399
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:48,446
(<i> Shel-la chuckles</i> )

400
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:51,615
We used to defend
ourselves better, Major.

401
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,493
Safety perimeters,
counterattacks

402
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,330
preemptive strikes.

403
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,167
And then we realized...

404
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,129
that it was all pointless.

405
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:11,177
When you cease to fear death,

406
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,847
the rules of
war change.

407
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:18,392
You'll understand as the years
begin to pass, Major.

408
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:22,104
Listen to me, Shel-la.

409
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,773
Our rescue is not going
to take years.

410
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:28,152
Days, weeks, maybe,
but they will find us

411
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:30,446
and then they'll penetrate
the defense-net

412
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:32,365
and transport us out of here.

413
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:36,285
Then you will be luckier
than we have been.

414
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:39,372
We'd be willing to transport
all of you away from here

415
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:40,789
if that's what you want.

416
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,669
Away from here?

417
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:50,716
To live one life
to die in peace...

418
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,178
to us, this is
an ancient prayer

419
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,430
that has never been
answered, Commander.

420
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:02,978
You would do this for us?

421
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,355
For both sides--

422
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:06,357
the Ennis
and the Nol-Ennis.

423
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:11,070
After you leave,
you can go wherever you want,
but end this nightmare.

424
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,238
Stop fighting long enough

425
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,156
for all of us
to get off this moon.

426
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:17,659
Zlangco, the leader of the Nol
would never agree
to a cease-fire.

427
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,036
Ask him.

428
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:21,080
You don't know them!
All they care about is...

429
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,873
What do you care about?

430
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,792
If you want to end
the suffering of your people,
then at least try.

431
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,962
Set a meeting
with this Zlangco.

432
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,714
Talk about this.

433
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:35,094
(<i> laughing</i> )

434
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,388
This is hopeless.

435
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,056
But I<i> will</i> talk...

436
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,641
if he will.

437
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:59,159
I'm not reading a single
M-Class planet in the system.

438
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,787
If they went down
anywhere around here,
they couldn't have survived.

439
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,457
I'm not sure we can believe
the scans, Chief.

440
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:07,751
The star is putting out
abnormal levels
of delta radiation.

441
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,087
That would foul up
our long-range scanners.

442
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,756
We'll have to survey
each planet one at a time.

443
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:17,261
Not to mention...
two dozen or so moons

444
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:19,763
and an asteroid belt.

445
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,848
Bloody needle in a haystack.

446
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,060
A needle in a haystack.

447
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:28,314
What we need is a magnet.

448
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:31,858
A magnet?

449
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,319
Yeah. You want to pick
your piece of metal

450
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,195
out of straw,
you use a magnet.

451
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:38,031
I don't think
I'm following you, Chief.

452
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,200
Runabout hulls are made
of metallic composites

453
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:43,203
that interact
with magnetic fields.

454
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:46,039
We could send out a few probes
to scan the system

455
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:49,460
for those specific
magnetic resonance patterns.

456
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,337
If Sisko's runabout
is in the system,

457
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:54,340
we might pick up a fluctuation
in the hysteresis curve.

458
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:55,673
The magnetic deflection

459
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,593
of a runabout's hull
is extremely weak.

460
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,470
The probes will never be
able to detect it.

461
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:04,433
They will if I can outfit them
with a differential magnetomer.

462
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:05,851
A differential magnetomer?

463
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,311
Mm-hmm.

464
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:09,146
I've never heard of
a differential magnetomer.

465
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,606
How does it work?

466
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:12,774
I'll let you know
as soon as I
finish making one.

467
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,578
(<i> electrical crackling</i> )

468
00:28:30,668 --> 00:28:31,793
(<i> sighs</i> )

469
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,629
Nice work, Julian.

470
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,428
I'm surprised.

471
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,763
Zlangco has agreed
to listen to your proposals.

472
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,057
Good. When?

473
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,475
Right away.

474
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:48,394
We'll meet at a neutral site
near your vessel.

475
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,396
We've both agreed
to carry no firearms.

476
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,981
What if they use
the opportunity
to set a trap?

477
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:55,984
We've taken the appropriate
precautions, Major,

478
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,570
but if you personally
would care

479
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:00,197
to check the security,
I'm sure your Commander

480
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,282
would allow you
to accompany us...

481
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,035
Major Kira will
be staying here
with the Kai.

482
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,497
What a shame.

483
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,507
You can't bury it, Kira.

484
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,761
What?

485
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:25,264
Do you recognize yourself
in these people?

486
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,557
Me?

487
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:31,729
Oh, not...
not at all, I...

488
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,356
They're content to die.

489
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:36,858
I've always fought
to stay alive.

490
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,862
Oh...

491
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:48,412
I don't want you to have
the wrong impression
of me, Opaka.

492
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,836
Just what impression
do you think I have?

493
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,006
That, that...

494
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:05,011
that I enjoy
any of this. I...

495
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,222
I don't enjoy fighting.

496
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:08,848
Yes, I've...

497
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,602
I've fought my entire life,
but for a good cause.

498
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:13,520
For our freedom,
our independence.

499
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:18,150
And it was... it was brutal
and ugly, and... uh...

500
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:23,656
but that's over for me now.

501
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:27,367
That's... that's not who I am.

502
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:35,459
I-I don't want you to think
that I am this...

503
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:40,046
violent person without a soul,
without a conscience.

504
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,382
That-That is not who I am.

505
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,481
Oh!

506
00:30:57,523 --> 00:31:02,110
Don't deny the violence
inside of you, Kira.

507
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:05,113
Only when you accept it
can you move beyond it.

508
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:14,414
I've known nothing but violence
since I was a child.

509
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:21,129
In the eyes
of the Prophets

510
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,549
we're all children.

511
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,051
Bajor has much
to learn from peace.

512
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:33,308
I'm afraid the Prophets
won't forgive me.

513
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,689
They're just waiting for
you to forgive yourself.

514
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:52,327
COMPUTER:
<i>22 minutes into launch.</i>

515
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,788
<i>All readings</i>
<i>within normal parameters.</i>

516
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,582
Probe "B" approaching
planet six.

517
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,751
Three moons.

518
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:01,127
No change
in the hysteresis curve.

519
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,797
Probe "C" approaching
planet seven.

520
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,552
No change.

521
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:10,763
What the hell would they
be doing here anyway?

522
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,681
It's a waste of time.

523
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:14,224
They could be
20 light-years from here

524
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,851
and we wouldn't have
the first clue.

525
00:32:15,893 --> 00:32:19,772
Probe "A" approaching
planet three. One moon.

526
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:20,856
<i>( beeping )</i>

527
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:22,524
Chief...

528
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:26,111
COMPUTER:
<i>Probe "A" measuring</i>
<i>a .0012 fluctuation</i>

529

530
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,072
It's the third planet.

531
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,699
No, look, it isn't.

532
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:32,743
We're picking up something
from its moon.

533
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:35,788
Laying in a new
course, full impulse.

534
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,631
(<i> murmur of voices</i> )

535
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:02,439
Any progress, Doctor?

536
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,608
Yes, sir.
I've got the computer
up... more or less.

537
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,735
It's processing the data now.

538
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:09,863
I can already confirm that
these microbes are artificial.

539
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,740
Rather like
nanites, in a way.

540
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:13,074
I should have a
complete analysis

541
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,534
from the computer
in a few minutes.

542
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,202
What's going on?

543
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,537
Talks about a cease-fire.

544
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,665
No kidding?
How did you
arrange that?

545
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,584
I told them we'd transport them
off this moon.

546
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:25,003
Isn't that a bit like
assisting a jailbreak?

547
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,338
I don't need you to interpret

548
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,047
the Prime Directive
for me, Doctor.

549
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,341
Yes, sir, of course.
I only meant...

550
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,884
Whatever crimes
they've committed,

551
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:32,552
they've paid for
a hundred times over.

552
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:34,179
They've been altered somehow

553
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,306
and been abandoned
by their world.

554
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,308
I believe the Federation
would recognize them

555
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,268
as separate and unique.

556
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:43,396
Yes, sir.

557
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:46,733
Well, I should be checking
on that analysis.

558
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,071
So...

559
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,992
you are the leader
of the aliens.

560
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:58,704
Benjamin Sisko, Commander
of a Federation space station.

561
00:33:58,745 --> 00:33:59,913
Federation?

562
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:01,581
What does it matter
to us, Zlangco?

563
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:03,583
It matters to me.

564
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,084
The Federation
is made up

565
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,837
of over a hundred planets
who have allied themselves

566
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:10,131
for mutual scientific, cultural
and defensive benefits.

567
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:13,760
The mission my people
and I are on
is to explore the galaxy.

568
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:17,180
Such a noble purpose.

569
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,599
There'll be no reward for
our release, you know.

570
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:22,101
You are being a fool,
as usual.

571
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,771
A fool who always manages
to outwit you, Shel-la,

572
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:25,814
as I have proven

573
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:27,566
over and over again.

574
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:30,569
You care to die once again,
all you need to do is ask.

575
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,488
If you've had enough
of this

576
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,449
then make your leaders
stop and listen.

577
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:40,286
Your only reason
to live is to make
each other suffer.

578
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,455
If you've had enough
of suffering,

579
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,457
then make them stop.

580
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:49,421
I'm not here
to be a mediator,

581
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:50,797
but if you ask
for an alternative,

582
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,257
I'll give you one.

583
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,175
We're listening.

584
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:58,304
In a matter of days,
when our rescue party arrives,

585
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,933
I can arrange to transport
you and your people

586
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:05,520
off this moon, if both sides
can only cooperate

587
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:06,980
until then.

588
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:12,151
Zlangco, they will resettle us
on different planets.

589
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,279
If that's what you wish.

590
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,365
The two of you seem to have
discussed this plan in detail.

591
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:20,493
Of course.
His crew has been with us
for two days.

592
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:24,497
Explain why you chose to
ally yourself with the Ennis.

593
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,332
We have allied ourselves
with no one.

594
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,501
One of your people
fired a weapon at us.

595
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,963
We were defending ourselves.

596
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,591
I think you're lying.

597
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,593
I don't know
the alien,

598
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:37,928
but I know Shel-la.

599
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,930
I know how his mind works.

600
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:43,433
I promise you, this
is an Ennis trick

601
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:46,103
to lure our entire
population out of hiding

602
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,186
so they can be slaughtered.

603
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,647
That's not true...!

604
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:52,859
Then the Ennis
are surely willing

605
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,695
to make the first
gesture of peace.

606
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:58,949
Let them bring all of their
people out of hiding first

607
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:01,493
to prove their
honorable intentions.

608
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:05,497
(<i> chuckling</i> )

609
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:08,959
Do you think
that I would allow

610
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:13,588
a single Nol to escape
this planet alive?!

611
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:17,134
No more than I would
let an Ennis go free.

612
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:20,428
(<i> screaming battle cry</i> )

613
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,518
Ah!

614
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:38,864
(<i> grunts</i> )

615
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,949
(<i> yells</i> )

616
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,787
(<i> groans</i> )

617
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:01,553
I'm sorry, Commander,

618
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,013
but I've discovered
we can't afford to die here--

619
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,430
not even once.

620
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,028
O'BRIEN:
It's some kind
of artificial satellite system.

621
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,863
That's what our probe
must have picked up.

622
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:22,824
Our sensors are reading
life-forms
on the surface, Chief.

623
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:24,159
I think some of them
are human.

624
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:25,785
If the ship's down there,

625
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,871
why wouldn't the transponder
be sending out a...?

626
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:28,955
We're being scanned.

627
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,832
Increasing orbital altitude.

628
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:32,542
What are
you thinking?

629
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,961
Well, the only thing that could
block out a transponder signal

630
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:36,880
is a broadband damping field.

631
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:41,426
That requires a low-level
satellite system,
like this one.

632
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,220
Suddenly, we're being scanned
by those satellites, so...

633
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,179
Maybe they had
something to do

634
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:45,972
with our missing runabout.

635
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:49,392
Exactly. See?

636
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,144
They're putting out
a mutual induction field

637
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,813
that would block out 99%
of all transmissions

638
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,481
to and from the surface.

639
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:58,235
Is there any way for us to get
a com line through the field?

640
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,780
Well, I've got one percent
to work with, don't I?

641
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:16,544
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

642
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,846
The analysis is very clear.

643
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:29,307
Once the microbes
have restored a body
after death,

644
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,392
that body then becomes
permanently dependent on them

645
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,685
for all cellular functions.

646
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:33,728
Permanently?

647
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,063
It gets worse.

648
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:37,607
The designers made them
environment specific.

649
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:40,944
If the microbes are removed
from this ecosystem,

650
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:43,280
they'll stop functioning.

651
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,531
So, if we transport
anyone off this planet,

652
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:46,699
we kill them.

653
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,035
I'm afraid so.

654
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,453
The Kai?

655
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:55,792
O'BRIEN:
Rio Grande<i> to Sisko.</i>

656
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:56,835
<i>Do you read me?</i>

657
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,670
<i>This is O'Brien.</i>
<i>Come in.</i>

658
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,797
Go ahead, Chief.
I can barely read you.

659
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,632
DAX:
<i>Is everyone all right?</i>

660
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:06,303
We're alive,
but the<i> Yangtzee Kiang</i>
was destroyed.

661
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,762
Will you be able
to beam us up?

662
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:09,306
O'BRIEN:
<i>Not quite yet, Commander.</i>

663
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,849
We've got to find
a way to penetrate

664
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,184
this network
of satellites.

665
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:13,518
They're making it impossible
for us

666
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,020
to lock on to anything
down there.

667
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,395
<i>Understood.</i>

668
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,064
But those satellites
will come after you

669
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:19,398
if you get too close.

670
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,984
They're armed.

671
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:22,819
One of them cut us down
without any trouble at all.

672
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,487
<i>Yeah, we figured as much.</i>

673
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,239
Let me know before you're
ready to make an attempt.

674
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,658
<i>Acknowledged.</i>
Rio Grande<i> out.</i>

675
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,538
We have to talk to the Kai.

676
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,715
Is there a cease-fire?

677
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,383
Neither side
took it seriously.

678
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,468
I'm not at
all surprised.

679
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,055
You were right, Kira.

680
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,891
They don't know how to do
anything else<i> but</i> die.

681
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,060
They've forgotten how to live.

682
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,270
The<i> Rio Grande</i>
<i>has made contact.</i>

683
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:59,022
Dax and O'Brien
are in orbit.

684
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:02,108
They're working
on a way to penetrate
the defense system.

685
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,193
Uh--

686
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:05,403
I'll be staying,
Commander.

687
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,323
What?

688
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:11,868
This is the answer
to all the prophecies
of my life.

689
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,203
It's the wrong answer,
Opaka.

690
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:14,662
You can't stay here.

691
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:16,789
I didn't know how or why,
but when we came

692
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:21,419
through the wormhole,
I knew I wouldn't be returning.

693
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,171
You must tell our people, Kira

694
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:26,758
that I have answered the call
of the Prophets.

695
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,885
I was brought here
because it is time

696
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:34,473
for these people
to begin their healing process

697
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:35,808
just as you were brought here

698
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,560
to begin yours.

699
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:41,398
You know, all we really
need to do is find a way

700
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,150
to create a gap in the net.

701
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:46,194
Maybe a photon would destroy
one of the satellites.

702
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:49,155
Maybe, but you think they'd
build a defense network

703
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,116
with that in mind.

704
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:54,119
You shoot one,
the rest might swarm up

705
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,371
like Vayan horn flies.

706
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,042
We need to go
for something simpler.

707
00:41:02,419 --> 00:41:05,046
All I need is about
a 15% increase

708
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:06,965
in the opening in the net.

709
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,348
<i>Rio Grande</i> to Sisko.

710
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,891
<i>Go ahead, Chief.</i>

711
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:18,726
We're going to try to
poke a hole up here, sir.

712
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:20,728
If you're about ready
to end your stay.

713
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,730
<i>Only three of us</i>
<i>are coming back.</i>

714
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:26,192
<i>Kai Opaka is remaining.</i>

715
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:27,610
Benjamin, please confirm.

716
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,821
Did you say we're not
transporting the Kai?

717
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,573
<i>That's correct.</i>
<i>I'll explain later.</i>

718
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,575
We need a few minutes,
Commander.

719
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,035
Rio Grande<i> out.</i>

720
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:41,791
Leaving without us?

721
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:45,003
My analysis of these microbes
that keep you alive

722
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,796
showed that if you were
to leave this moon,

723
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,714
you would die.

724
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,467
Then there is no end.

725
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:54,137
Commander...

726
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:57,223
I find myself caught
in a moral dilemma.

727
00:41:57,265 --> 00:42:00,643
As much as I am dedicated
to the preservation of life,

728
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,645
I wonder if we shouldn't
help these people

729
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,147
put an end to this torture.

730
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:05,315
How could you do that?

731
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:06,858
Anything that can be
programmed

732
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,360
can be reprogrammed.

733
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:09,527
If I could disable

734
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,488
the mechanism in
these microbes,

735
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,406
they should no longer function
when someone is killed

736
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:16,034
and these people would
finally be able to die.

737
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:22,123
You've seen our life here.

738
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:25,543
Please,
it's the only solution left.

739
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:28,380
You give us a way
to reprogram these microbes

740
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:30,256
and we'll put an end
to this war.

741
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:33,759
You really think
the fear of death
will end the fighting?

742
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,387
Never has in any other war.

743
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:37,472
No.

744
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:41,309
But it will allow us
to finally win

745
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:43,895
to wipe out the Nol for good.

746
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,564
On this world, Doctor,

747
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:50,360
your disabled microbes
would be the ultimate weapon.

748
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:54,822
We could finally
and truly destroy our enemies!

749
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:57,658
O'BRIEN:
Rio Grande<i> to Sisko.</i>
<i>Stand by for transport.</i>

750
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,499
Ready.

751
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:06,084
Coordinates set.

752
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:09,170
Launching probe.

753
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:11,130
DAX:
12 seconds to intercept.

754
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:14,759
Go on, go on, go for it.

755
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,677
DAX:
One of the satellites
is breaking orbit

756
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:17,720
moving toward the probe.

757
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:20,390
That's it.

758
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:22,225
DAX:
The satellite is showing
a power buildup--

759
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,143
about 800 megawatts.

760
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,148
Probe destroyed.

761
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,316
<i>Rio Grande</i> to Sisko.

762
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:32,110
Trying to lock on, Commander.

763
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:34,820
<i>Establishing pattern lock.</i>

764
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,531
You can't leave
without giving us...

765
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:39,242
Energize when
ready, Chief.

766
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:42,537
(<i> explosions and yelling</i> )

767
00:43:49,586 --> 00:43:54,299
Opaka, if we can
ever find a way...

768
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,135
My work is here now, Commander.

769
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:05,059
But your Pagh and mine...

770
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,314
will cross again.

771
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,199
O'BRIEN:
<i>Energizing.</i>

772
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:28,625
(<i> fighting continues</i> )
