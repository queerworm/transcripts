1
00:00:04,534 --> 00:00:06,664
There it goes again.

2
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:09,975
That's the seventh time
in the last two hours.

3
00:00:10,014 --> 00:00:12,747
Still no idea what's causing it?

4
00:00:12,786 --> 00:00:14,916
It seems to be
opening and closing

5
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:16,552
completely at random.

6
00:00:16,595 --> 00:00:18,360
No unusual readings.

7
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:20,062
No ships coming through.

8
00:00:20,102 --> 00:00:22,198
For all we know,
the Bajorans are right.

9
00:00:22,241 --> 00:00:24,337
Maybe it is a message
from the Prophets.

10
00:00:24,378 --> 00:00:25,972
Emissary.

11
00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:29,512
Hmm. If it is,
they didn't tell me.

12
00:00:29,556 --> 00:00:31,823
Maybe the Prophets
don't recognize you

13
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:33,022
with the new beard.

14
00:00:33,065 --> 00:00:36,470
There must be a scientific
explanation for this.

15
00:00:40,548 --> 00:00:42,211
Here we go.

16
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:45,247
Something funny, old man?

17
00:00:45,324 --> 00:00:47,454
Hmm? No, nothing.

18
00:00:47,496 --> 00:00:49,056
Ops to Captain Sisko.

19
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,159
Sisko here.

20
00:00:50,202 --> 00:00:52,673
Captain, we are receiving
a priority one message

21
00:00:52,707 --> 00:00:53,971
from Starfleet Security.

22
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,639
On my way.

23
00:00:58,955 --> 00:01:03,591
Then the Andorian says,
"That's not my antenna."

24
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,171
Why do I bother?

25
00:01:07,206 --> 00:01:08,333
Quark!

26
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:11,815
What can I do for you,
Constable?

27
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:13,216
Dax... where is she?

28
00:01:13,253 --> 00:01:16,249
She's not here.

29
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,091
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

30
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,658
You find all this very funny,
don't you?

31
00:01:20,702 --> 00:01:22,832
You and Dax
probably planned it together.

32
00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:24,467
Planned what?

33
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,478
Moving my furniture.

34
00:01:25,512 --> 00:01:27,209
Is that what this is all about?

35
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,879
Someone moved your furniture?

36
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:31,017
Not someone... Commander Dax.

37
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:34,122
It's the fourth time
she's done it this past year.

38
00:01:34,165 --> 00:01:36,898
She breaks into my quarters
while I'm regenerating

39
00:01:36,938 --> 00:01:38,703
and moves all my furniture
out of alignment.

40
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:41,839
Shifts one piece
three centimeters to the right

41
00:01:41,882 --> 00:01:44,410
the next
four centimeters to the left.

42
00:01:44,454 --> 00:01:46,652
Not one object in my quarters

43
00:01:46,693 --> 00:01:48,663
is where it's supposed to be.

44
00:01:48,697 --> 00:01:50,724
And... is that a bad thing?

45
00:01:50,768 --> 00:01:54,971
Everything I own is carefully
and painstakingly arranged.

46
00:01:55,011 --> 00:01:56,001
Dax knows this

47
00:01:56,046 --> 00:01:58,609
and yet she takes
a perverse delight

48
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:01,021
in throwing
my quarters into chaos.

49
00:02:01,057 --> 00:02:04,292
I'd hardly call
three centimeters "chaos."

50
00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:06,894
Maybe you wouldn't, but I do.

51
00:02:06,937 --> 00:02:09,933
You humanoids are all alike.

52
00:02:09,977 --> 00:02:11,446
You have no sense of order

53
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:15,684
and Dax is the most
humanoid person I know.

54
00:02:15,723 --> 00:02:17,317
Sisko to Constable Odo.

55
00:02:17,394 --> 00:02:18,589
Odo here.

56
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:19,928
Please report to Ops immediately.

57
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:21,025
Acknowledged.

58
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:23,665
Uh, when you see Dax

59
00:02:23,707 --> 00:02:25,142
say hello to her for me.

60
00:02:30,823 --> 00:02:32,622
How many people were
at the conference?

61
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,031
27, including
the Tholian observer.

62
00:02:36,068 --> 00:02:38,539
27... it's unbelievable.

63
00:02:38,573 --> 00:02:40,669
Federation President

64
00:02:40,712 --> 00:02:44,881
Jaresh-lnyo has declared
a planet-wide day of mourning.

65
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:47,650
Constable, take a seat.

66
00:02:47,693 --> 00:02:48,820
Of course.

67
00:02:48,862 --> 00:02:50,889
Ten minutes ago,
we received a recording

68
00:02:50,934 --> 00:02:52,836
of a high-level
diplomatic conference

69
00:02:52,871 --> 00:02:54,534
that took place
between the Federation

70
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:57,046
and the Romulan Empire
on Earth two days ago.

71
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,488
Computer, begin replay
at time index 5-9-11.

72
00:03:07,036 --> 00:03:08,801
A bomb.

73
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:10,240
Of unknown composition.

74
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:12,839
A crime like this hasn't
been committed on Earth

75
00:03:12,882 --> 00:03:14,181
in over a hundred years.

76
00:03:14,218 --> 00:03:16,883
Go back and show him
what you showed us.

77
00:03:16,924 --> 00:03:20,557
Computer, restart recording
at time index 5-9-1-6.

78
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:22,363
One-tenth normal speed.

79
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,335
Freeze picture.

80
00:03:25,376 --> 00:03:28,007
Enlarge section F-3 and enhance.

81
00:03:30,888 --> 00:03:32,323
Keep your eye
on the piece of pottery.

82
00:03:32,358 --> 00:03:35,627
Computer,
resume at one-tenth speed.

83
00:03:39,207 --> 00:03:40,870
That's a changeling.

84
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,406
No sign of a changeling
was found in the aftermath.

85
00:03:44,451 --> 00:03:47,618
We must assume
that it escaped unharmed.

86
00:03:47,658 --> 00:03:50,459
I was hoping that this
would never happen

87
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:52,969
but it finally has.

88
00:03:53,003 --> 00:03:57,172
The changelings
have reached Earth.

89
00:05:57,811 --> 00:06:00,044
How's that?

90
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,247
Another centimeter to the left.

91
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:04,451
Shouldn't you be on the <i>Lakota?</i>

92
00:06:04,492 --> 00:06:07,097
The <i>Lakota</i> won't depart
for another hour.

93
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,029
Which gives us plenty of time

94
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:11,800
to repair the damage
you've done to my room.

95
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:15,110
And while I'm gone, I want
your solemn word that you'll

96
00:06:15,148 --> 00:06:16,207
stay out of my quarters.

97
00:06:16,317 --> 00:06:17,307
You've got it.

98
00:06:18,822 --> 00:06:19,790
So, how long do you think

99
00:06:19,824 --> 00:06:21,316
you and Captain Sisko
will be on Earth?

100
00:06:21,361 --> 00:06:22,990
I have no idea.

101
00:06:23,032 --> 00:06:26,871
I just hope this trip
isn't a waste of time.

102
00:06:26,907 --> 00:06:29,003
I'm not sure
what Captain Sisko and I

103
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:31,038
can tell Starfleet
about my people

104
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,884
that hasn't already
been in our reports.

105
00:06:33,922 --> 00:06:36,155
Believe me, Odo,
with changelings on Earth

106
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:39,133
Starfleet's going to need
all the help it can get.

107
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,640
There. How's that?

108
00:06:42,675 --> 00:06:45,112
A little more to the left.

109
00:06:45,147 --> 00:06:47,414
Whatever you say, Constable.

110
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:52,062
Wait till you see
the size of the eggplant

111
00:06:52,096 --> 00:06:53,690
I'm getting out
of my garden this year.

112
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:54,792
As big as Crenshaw melons

113
00:06:54,835 --> 00:06:57,774
and twice as heavy.

114
00:06:57,808 --> 00:06:59,107
So, how is Judith?

115
00:06:59,144 --> 00:07:01,615
She still helping out
in the restaurant?

116
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,643
I sent her home to Portland.

117
00:07:03,688 --> 00:07:06,592
Your sister's got
her own life to worry about.

118
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:10,591
Besides, she never puts enough
cayenne pepper in the jambalaya.

119
00:07:10,636 --> 00:07:12,629
Just like Mom.

120
00:07:12,675 --> 00:07:15,773
Which means she has
no business in the kitchen.

121
00:07:15,814 --> 00:07:18,912
It'll be good to have you
home again, Benjamin.

122
00:07:18,954 --> 00:07:20,253
Jake, too.

123
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:24,630
Dad, you know that this
isn't exactly a vacation.

124
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:27,002
I'll be spending most
of my time in San Francisco

125
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,234
at Starfleet Headquarters.

126
00:07:28,275 --> 00:07:31,271
Whatever you do during the day
is your business.

127
00:07:31,315 --> 00:07:32,682
But at dinner time

128
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,952
you better get yourself
down to New Orleans.

129
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:37,722
No son of mine is going
to eat that replicated slop

130
00:07:37,763 --> 00:07:39,494
Starfleet calls food.

131
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:41,936
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

132
00:07:41,972 --> 00:07:43,999
You won't get
any argument from me.

133
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,844
So, Dad...

134
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:50,015
you feeling okay?

135
00:07:50,056 --> 00:07:52,653
Oh, let's not start that again.

136
00:07:52,696 --> 00:07:54,256
It's just a question.

137
00:07:54,298 --> 00:07:56,097
You look a little tired.

138
00:07:56,137 --> 00:07:58,506
How's the new aorta holding up?

139
00:07:58,542 --> 00:08:01,343
The doctors say
I am a medical marvel.

140
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:05,048
At the rate things are going,
in a year or two

141
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:08,551
I won't have an original organ
left in my body.

142
00:08:08,597 --> 00:08:11,433
They'll write me up
in the medical books.

143
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,634
Well, but you're feeling okay?

144
00:08:13,675 --> 00:08:17,206
Just point me in the direction
of a party and a pretty girl

145
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:19,242
and I'll show you
how good I feel.

146
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:24,697
Make sure you call me
as soon as you and Jake get in.

147
00:08:24,732 --> 00:08:27,705
Your rooms are always waiting
and ready for you.

148
00:08:27,739 --> 00:08:29,072
I know that, Dad.

149
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,579
We'll be there
before you know it.

150
00:08:38,362 --> 00:08:39,330
Jake-o.

151
00:08:39,364 --> 00:08:40,389
Dad.

152
00:08:40,434 --> 00:08:42,233
You just missed Grandpa Joe.

153
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,765
Did you tell him we're
staying in San Francisco?

154
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,643
Uh, I didn't quite
get around to it.

155
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,616
Ah. Dad.

156
00:08:49,787 --> 00:08:51,120
You know
if we stay with Grandpa

157
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:53,024
he's going to put me
to work in the kitchen.

158
00:08:53,061 --> 00:08:55,692
Is that so bad?

159
00:08:55,734 --> 00:08:57,363
Well, chopping vegetables
for nine hours a day

160
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:58,703
isn't exactly my idea
of a vacation.

161
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:00,939
Well, Jake, you're
not a child anymore.

162
00:09:00,978 --> 00:09:03,745
Grandpa will not expect you
to chop vegetables.

163
00:09:04,754 --> 00:09:05,983
He'll want you to wait tables.

164
00:09:06,023 --> 00:09:07,082
Oh!

165
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:13,001
Barkeep.

166
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:17,208
So, what can I get
you two flyboys?

167
00:09:17,248 --> 00:09:18,409
A Scotch, neat

168
00:09:18,483 --> 00:09:21,011
and a pint of your finest
bitter for my mate.

169
00:09:21,056 --> 00:09:22,115
Make it quick.

170
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,753
The cabbage crates
will be coming back

171
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,095
over the briny any minute now.

172
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,121
All right, all right.

173
00:09:26,168 --> 00:09:27,865
I'd hate to let the Jerries

174
00:09:27,905 --> 00:09:30,172
strafe that green
and pleasant land of yours

175
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:32,042
while the two of you
were taking time out

176
00:09:32,081 --> 00:09:33,049
to get a drink.

177
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,712
No choice, man.
Ritual, you know.

178
00:09:34,753 --> 00:09:37,452
To Clive, the best bloke

179
00:09:37,525 --> 00:09:39,461
ever to prang his kite
into the Channel.

180
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,626
Ah, got to keep
a stiff upper lip.

181
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:42,795
Hear, hear.

182
00:09:42,838 --> 00:09:44,171
Down the hatch.

183
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:53,719
Ah-ah!

184
00:09:53,762 --> 00:09:56,529
Now, remember what I said
about throwing glasses.

185
00:10:03,382 --> 00:10:05,615
So, you want to go back up

186
00:10:05,654 --> 00:10:08,855
and have another crack
at the Jerries?

187
00:10:08,895 --> 00:10:10,194
Oh, I don't know.

188
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,929
To tell you the truth,
my heart isn't in it.

189
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,102
Aren't you taking Clive's death
a little seriously?

190
00:10:16,143 --> 00:10:17,737
After all, he was just
a holosuite character.

191
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,684
It's not Clive.
It's Earth.

192
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:22,657
You probably wouldn't
understand this, Quark

193
00:10:22,691 --> 00:10:24,992
but when you care
about a place

194
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,998
and it's in trouble

195
00:10:26,032 --> 00:10:27,661
and you want to do
something about it

196
00:10:27,702 --> 00:10:29,331
and you can't

197
00:10:29,372 --> 00:10:30,739
it's very frustrating.

198
00:10:30,776 --> 00:10:32,678
I know exactly what you mean.

199
00:10:32,713 --> 00:10:36,779
When the Great Monetary Collapse
hit Ferenginar

200
00:10:36,822 --> 00:10:38,689
I was hundreds
of light-years away

201
00:10:38,727 --> 00:10:42,189
serving as a ship's cook
on a long-haul freighter.

202
00:10:42,235 --> 00:10:45,697
I can't tell you
the heartbreak I suffered

203
00:10:45,742 --> 00:10:49,615
knowing that rampant inflation
and currency devaluation

204
00:10:49,718 --> 00:10:51,449
were burning like wildfires

205
00:10:51,488 --> 00:10:54,518
through the lush financial
foliage of my home.

206
00:10:54,562 --> 00:10:56,999
It still depresses me
even today.

207
00:10:57,033 --> 00:11:00,529
I remember thinking
my accounts needed me

208
00:11:00,575 --> 00:11:02,067
and there was nothing
I could do.

209
00:11:02,112 --> 00:11:05,951
I-I-I felt so... so helpless.

210
00:11:05,986 --> 00:11:08,355
So you see...

211
00:11:08,392 --> 00:11:10,590
I do understand.

212
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,259
Somehow, you telling me that

213
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:14,932
doesn't make me feel
the least bit better.

214
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,937
Hu-mans.

215
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,953
All you care about
is yourselves.

216
00:11:20,986 --> 00:11:22,455
Odo!

217
00:11:22,489 --> 00:11:23,981
Hang on a second.

218
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:30,332
Well, I take it
the Battle of Britain

219
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:31,466
has been won yet again.

220
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:32,876
There's a Spitfire
with your name on it

221
00:11:32,912 --> 00:11:33,880
waiting in the hangar.

222
00:11:33,915 --> 00:11:34,940
When you get back from Earth

223
00:11:34,984 --> 00:11:36,647
you can take Clive's
place in the squadron.

224
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:38,315
Somehow I doubt it.

225
00:11:38,358 --> 00:11:40,385
Look, Odo, do me a favor.

226
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:41,556
If you get a chance

227
00:11:41,598 --> 00:11:43,796
stop by and visit
my folks in Dublin.

228
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:45,397
Just make sure
they're okay, you know?

229
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,103
I'll try to find the time.

230
00:11:47,144 --> 00:11:49,240
Good. I'll let them know
you might drop by.

231
00:11:49,282 --> 00:11:51,446
Anyone I can look up
for you, Doctor?

232
00:11:51,487 --> 00:11:54,015
Uh, no, no, that'll be fine.

233
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:55,926
Um, just wish I was
coming with you.

234
00:11:55,963 --> 00:11:57,192
Well, to be quite honest, Doctor

235
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:58,702
I wish both of you
were going with me.

236
00:11:58,769 --> 00:11:59,702
I could use the company.

237
00:11:59,772 --> 00:12:02,505
I... I doubt
that a shape-shifter

238
00:12:02,544 --> 00:12:04,811
will be welcome on Earth
at the moment.

239
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,879
No one can hold you responsible
for what your people are doing.

240
00:12:07,922 --> 00:12:09,687
Oh, really?

241
00:12:10,762 --> 00:12:13,997
Well, I'd better get
over to the <i>Lakota.</i>

242
00:12:14,036 --> 00:12:15,665
We'll be leaving shortly.

243
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,836
Good luck.

244
00:12:17,877 --> 00:12:19,779
I don't believe in luck.

245
00:12:19,816 --> 00:12:23,483
But I appreciate the sentiment.

246
00:12:27,232 --> 00:12:29,499
Well, we better get
out of these uniforms.

247
00:12:29,536 --> 00:12:30,869
Ah.

248
00:12:36,084 --> 00:12:38,020
The <i>Lakota's</i> gone to warp.

249
00:12:38,056 --> 00:12:39,958
When was the last time
the wormhole opened?

250
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,154
12 hours ago.

251
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:43,256
Perhaps it has
returned to normal.

252
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,929
I suppose so.

253
00:12:44,971 --> 00:12:47,135
You sound disappointed, Major.

254
00:12:47,176 --> 00:12:48,907
I guess I am.

255
00:12:48,946 --> 00:12:50,939
Part of me was hoping
that the Prophets were behind it

256
00:12:50,984 --> 00:12:52,749
that they were finally
going to show themselves

257
00:12:52,788 --> 00:12:53,881
to the Bajoran people.

258
00:12:53,924 --> 00:12:56,623
I prefer Klingon beliefs.

259
00:12:56,663 --> 00:12:58,707
I supposed your Gods
aren't as cryptic as ours.

260
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,933
Our Gods are dead.

261
00:12:59,977 --> 00:13:03,678
Ancient Klingon warriors
slew them a millennia ago.

262
00:13:03,718 --> 00:13:06,953
They were more trouble
than they were worth.

263
00:13:06,992 --> 00:13:10,625
I don't think I'll ever
understand Klingons.

264
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:12,660
Don't worry about it, Major.

265
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:14,003
Nobody does.

266
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,342
That's the way they like it.

267
00:13:23,662 --> 00:13:24,630
Ben.

268
00:13:24,664 --> 00:13:25,963
Admiral Leyton.

269
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,663
Good to see you again, sir.

270
00:13:27,704 --> 00:13:28,694
Captain Sisko.

271
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,236
This is my adjutant,
Commander Benteen.

272
00:13:32,281 --> 00:13:34,684
Benjamin was
my executive officer

273
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:36,086
aboard the <i>Okinawa</i>

274
00:13:36,122 --> 00:13:37,853
and a damn fine one, too.

275
00:13:37,893 --> 00:13:38,861
I did all right.

276
00:13:38,895 --> 00:13:40,124
Ah, don't be modest.

277
00:13:40,165 --> 00:13:42,432
Admiral Leyton has had his
share of executive officers

278
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,566
and you're the only one
he ever speaks fondly of.

279
00:13:44,608 --> 00:13:46,578
Present company excluded.

280
00:13:46,613 --> 00:13:48,880
Admiral Leyton is the one
who recommended me

281
00:13:48,918 --> 00:13:50,410
for the job on Deep Space 9.

282
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,857
One of my better ideas.

283
00:13:52,893 --> 00:13:54,590
You must be Odo.

284
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,825
That's right.

285
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,306
Forgive me for staring

286
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,404
but you're the first
changeling I've ever met.

287
00:14:02,447 --> 00:14:03,814
That you know of.

288
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,378
I sympathize with your problem.

289
00:14:06,422 --> 00:14:10,591
Uncovering changeling
infiltrators is no easy task.

290
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:13,035
Well, with the help
of the two of you

291
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:15,371
I trust it'll be
a little easier.

292
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:17,436
What exactly do you
want us to do?

293
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,473
We'd like to confer
with you and Odo.

294
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:21,019
See if there's anything
about the Founders

295
00:14:21,055 --> 00:14:23,253
you left out
of your official reports.

296
00:14:23,293 --> 00:14:25,024
I'll help in any way I can

297
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,729
but I think you'll find my
reports were quite thorough.

298
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:31,368
Admiral, I doubt you brought us
all this way

299
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,902
just for a debriefing.

300
00:14:32,947 --> 00:14:34,246
Of course not.

301
00:14:34,284 --> 00:14:38,316
Ben, Earth is in danger...

302
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,695
maybe the greatest
danger it's faced

303
00:14:40,732 --> 00:14:42,395
since the last World War.

304
00:14:42,435 --> 00:14:45,374
Something has to be done
about these shape-shifters

305
00:14:45,408 --> 00:14:47,241
which is why you're here.

306
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,079
You know more about the Dominion
than anyone in Starfleet.

307
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:53,752
And so, effective immediately,
I'm making you acting head

308
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:55,558
of Starfleet Security
here on Earth.

309
00:14:55,597 --> 00:14:58,000
Congratulations, Captain.

310
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,387
This is one beautiful fish.

311
00:15:09,428 --> 00:15:12,127
Seems a shame
to eat a trout this pretty.

312
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:14,297
Why, you should thank me
for the privilege

313
00:15:14,338 --> 00:15:16,240
of simply looking at it.

314
00:15:16,276 --> 00:15:17,335
Well, go on, take a bite.

315
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:18,712
It won't bite you back.

316
00:15:18,748 --> 00:15:20,047
Now, I don't want to see

317
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,422
anybody studying
the dessert menu.

318
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:26,762
If you order anything
but the bread pudding soufflé

319
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:29,498
you'll be making a mistake
you will regret

320
00:15:29,538 --> 00:15:31,064
the rest of your lives.

321
00:15:31,109 --> 00:15:33,410
You should listen to him.

322
00:15:33,447 --> 00:15:35,577
The man knows his bread pudding.

323
00:15:35,618 --> 00:15:36,951
Benjamin!

324
00:15:40,229 --> 00:15:41,197
Dad.

325
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,199
Jake-o.

326
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,566
Hey.

327
00:15:43,603 --> 00:15:45,436
When are you going
to stop growing?

328
00:15:45,473 --> 00:15:48,036
If you keep this up,
you'll be bumping your head

329
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,708
on that alligator
before too long.

330
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:50,944
I remember when
you used to tell me

331
00:15:50,986 --> 00:15:52,455
that alligator
was just in stasis

332
00:15:52,489 --> 00:15:55,290
and you let it out every night
to guard the restaurant.

333
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:57,230
Oh, I had to stop doing that.

334
00:15:57,266 --> 00:15:59,236
It got to be too much trouble

335
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:02,642
wrestling it back up
to the ceiling every morning.

336
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:05,377
Come on, I'll get Nathan
to bring you both

337
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:07,718
something to eat,
and we can catch up.

338
00:16:07,756 --> 00:16:10,421
Nathan, some gumbo
for these fine, young men.

339
00:16:10,461 --> 00:16:11,794
Yes, sir.

340
00:16:11,831 --> 00:16:14,496
So... where's
this shape-shifting fellow

341
00:16:14,537 --> 00:16:16,029
you were coming with?

342
00:16:16,074 --> 00:16:19,605
With things the way they are,
Odo thought it would be better

343
00:16:19,682 --> 00:16:21,983
if he stayed
at Starfleet Headquarters.

344
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,387
I don't blame him.

345
00:16:23,424 --> 00:16:27,490
I haven't seen people so nervous
since the Borg scare.

346
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:31,975
Me, personally,
I'd like to meet him.

347
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:33,444
Though I have to admit

348
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:38,046
I-I'm a little suspicious
about anyone who doesn't eat.

349
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:39,057
Grandpa.

350
00:16:39,091 --> 00:16:40,788
Well, aren't you going
to eat anything?

351
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:43,027
I ate before you got here.

352
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:47,901
Son, don't look at me that way.

353
00:16:47,944 --> 00:16:49,538
You've lost weight.

354
00:16:49,581 --> 00:16:50,948
You think so?

355
00:16:50,984 --> 00:16:53,251
The doctors said you have
to keep your weight up.

356
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:54,553
Don't you start, too.

357
00:16:54,592 --> 00:16:56,961
I have a vat of crayfish
in the back

358
00:16:56,997 --> 00:16:57,965
that needs cleaning

359
00:16:57,999 --> 00:16:59,298
and it's got your name on it.

360
00:16:59,336 --> 00:17:02,969
Now, I'm going to say this
one time and one time only.

361
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:05,379
I am fine.

362
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:10,655
I'm happy, I'm healthy
and I'm planning on celebrating

363
00:17:10,694 --> 00:17:12,493
at least 50 more birthdays.

364
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:14,900
Satisfied?

365
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:25,020
Mmm. Gumbo is as good
as I remember.

366
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:30,266
Starfleet must be taking
the shape-shifters

367
00:17:30,304 --> 00:17:31,465
pretty seriously

368
00:17:31,506 --> 00:17:33,670
to have you come
all the way back here.

369
00:17:33,711 --> 00:17:36,274
It is serious, Dad.

370
00:17:36,317 --> 00:17:40,418
27 people murdered
right here on Earth.

371
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:44,092
Never thought I'd see the day.

372
00:17:44,134 --> 00:17:47,073
But now that my son's
on the case

373
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,974
I feel a lot better.

374
00:17:49,011 --> 00:17:50,878
Jake!

375
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,249
Nog?

376
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,551
Captain Sisko.

377
00:17:56,594 --> 00:17:57,755
What do you think?

378
00:17:57,831 --> 00:17:59,425
You look good, Cadet.

379
00:17:59,468 --> 00:18:00,767
You think so?

380
00:18:00,804 --> 00:18:02,171
Nog, I thought
I was going to see you

381
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:03,402
tomorrow at the Academy.

382
00:18:03,444 --> 00:18:04,412
You are.

383
00:18:04,446 --> 00:18:06,109
I'm just here for dinner.

384
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:07,378
Nathan, the usual.

385
00:18:07,418 --> 00:18:10,254
I didn't know
you liked Creole food.

386
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:11,727
I don't.
I like tube grubs.

387
00:18:11,795 --> 00:18:13,959
And your father is
the only person on this planet

388
00:18:13,999 --> 00:18:15,400
who can get me live ones.

389
00:18:15,436 --> 00:18:18,033
I've been thinking
of adding them to our menu.

390
00:18:18,075 --> 00:18:19,908
Of course, I'll have
to cook them

391
00:18:19,946 --> 00:18:21,279
for our human customers

392
00:18:21,316 --> 00:18:23,183
serve them
with a nice remoulade.

393
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,188
Cook them?

394
00:18:24,222 --> 00:18:25,555
What good are tube grubs

395
00:18:25,592 --> 00:18:27,619
if they don't wiggle
on the way down?

396
00:18:27,663 --> 00:18:29,781
So, how's everything
at the Academy?

397
00:18:29,913 --> 00:18:31,382
Jake, they call it the Academy

398
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:33,182
but what it really is,
is school.

399
00:18:33,221 --> 00:18:34,382
Well, I want to hear about it.

400
00:18:34,424 --> 00:18:35,791
It's a lot of work...

401
00:18:35,826 --> 00:18:38,195
lots of classes,
lots of studying...

402
00:18:38,265 --> 00:18:39,290
I'm doing okay.

403
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:41,806
Now, where are those tube grubs?

404
00:18:47,686 --> 00:18:48,745
Good night.

405
00:18:48,788 --> 00:18:50,382
You come back soon.

406
00:18:50,425 --> 00:18:51,393
Come on, Ben.

407
00:18:51,427 --> 00:18:53,090
I've got a nice bottle of cognac

408
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:55,227
I've been saving
for a special occasion

409
00:18:55,303 --> 00:18:56,670
and I think this qualifies.

410
00:18:56,705 --> 00:18:58,072
I think you're right.

411
00:18:58,109 --> 00:18:59,942
Ah, there's nothing like
a full stomach

412
00:18:59,979 --> 00:19:01,505
to make life worth living.

413
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:04,180
So, you going to tell me
what's on your mind or not?

414
00:19:04,222 --> 00:19:05,383
What do you mean?

415
00:19:05,425 --> 00:19:07,190
I mean, you didn't
stay here until closing

416
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,528
just to get one more root beer.

417
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:09,533
Something's up.

418
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:11,059
My friend, the writer...

419
00:19:11,104 --> 00:19:13,165
always looking for a good story.

420
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,372
If you don't want to tell me,
fine, don't tell me.

421
00:19:15,414 --> 00:19:17,043
It's nothing.

422
00:19:17,084 --> 00:19:18,610
It's stupid.

423
00:19:18,654 --> 00:19:19,622
All right.

424
00:19:19,656 --> 00:19:21,216
Forget about it.

425
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,694
It's just...

426
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,361
the Academy's different
than I thought it would be.

427
00:19:25,402 --> 00:19:26,563
Different how?

428
00:19:26,604 --> 00:19:28,233
Some of the cadets...

429
00:19:28,308 --> 00:19:30,643
they're kind of standoffish

430
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,240
especially the upperclassmen.

431
00:19:32,284 --> 00:19:33,479
Because you're a Ferengi?

432
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,183
That's what I thought at first

433
00:19:35,224 --> 00:19:37,251
but then I heard
some of the other freshmen

434
00:19:37,328 --> 00:19:38,854
complaining
about the same thing.

435
00:19:38,898 --> 00:19:40,231
Complaining about what?

436
00:19:40,268 --> 00:19:41,760
Little things.

437
00:19:41,804 --> 00:19:44,537
For instance, there's this group
called Red Squad

438
00:19:44,578 --> 00:19:46,172
made up of all the top students.

439
00:19:46,215 --> 00:19:47,809
They're always
going off on trips

440
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:49,081
getting special training.

441
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,488
None of them
will even talk to me.

442
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:52,927
You've only been in the Academy
for a month.

443
00:19:52,963 --> 00:19:54,990
You can't expect
to fit in right away.

444
00:19:55,034 --> 00:19:58,633
Who knows? One of these days,
you might even be in Red Squad.

445
00:19:58,675 --> 00:20:00,304
I'm sure if you let them
get to know you

446
00:20:00,346 --> 00:20:02,316
show them you're
a really good guy to be around

447
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,579
everything'll work out.

448
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,718
I am a good guy to be around,
aren't I?

449
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:08,661
I always thought so.

450
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:14,339
Mr. President, I'd like
to introduce Captain Sisko.

451
00:20:14,377 --> 00:20:16,347
Captain, I've seen your record

452
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:17,712
most exemplary.

453
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:19,152
Thank you, sir.

454
00:20:19,187 --> 00:20:21,248
Captain Sisko has
several suggestions

455
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:23,525
on how to combat
Dominion infiltration.

456
00:20:23,564 --> 00:20:25,933
I think you'll find them
very interesting.

457
00:20:25,968 --> 00:20:27,267
Hmm...

458
00:20:27,305 --> 00:20:30,369
I understand the need
for increased security, but...

459
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:32,314
blood screenings, phaser sweeps?

460
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:35,082
They've proven very effective
on Deep Space 9.

461
00:20:35,122 --> 00:20:36,716
I'm sure they have

462
00:20:36,758 --> 00:20:40,061
but I hope you'll keep in mind
that this is Earth

463
00:20:40,099 --> 00:20:42,332
and not a military installation.

464
00:20:42,371 --> 00:20:44,740
Which means it's a
lot more vulnerable.

465
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,405
We have to take precautions.

466
00:20:46,514 --> 00:20:48,211
Precautions may be advisable

467
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:51,281
but I will not disrupt the lives
of the population

468
00:20:51,324 --> 00:20:53,294
despite what happened
at Antwerp.

469
00:20:53,328 --> 00:20:56,927
I believe the changeling threat
to be somewhat less serious

470
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,199
than Starfleet does.

471
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:02,305
Mr. President, I assure you,
the threat is real.

472
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:05,344
For all we know, there was
only one changeling on Earth

473
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,382
and he may not
even be here anymore.

474
00:21:07,493 --> 00:21:10,124
But, if he is here,
we have a problem.

475
00:21:10,165 --> 00:21:12,398
There's no telling
how much damage

476
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,030
one changeling can do.

477
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:16,841
Forgive me
for saying so, Captain

478
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,907
but you sound a little paranoid.

479
00:21:18,952 --> 00:21:20,478
Do I?

480
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:26,958
Forgive the intrusion,
Mr. President

481
00:21:27,003 --> 00:21:28,164
but as you can see

482
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:30,642
Starfleet has every right
to be concerned.

483
00:21:30,677 --> 00:21:34,618
Allow me to introduce Odo,
my Chief of Security.

484
00:21:34,653 --> 00:21:37,888
A very effective entrance,
Mr. Odo.

485
00:21:37,927 --> 00:21:40,831
One that never should
have been allowed to take place.

486
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,394
Admiral Leyton and Captain Sisko
walked in here

487
00:21:43,438 --> 00:21:45,431
without being searched,
without being blood-tested

488
00:21:45,477 --> 00:21:47,413
and without having
their possessions

489
00:21:47,447 --> 00:21:49,611
subjected to phaser sweeps.

490
00:21:49,653 --> 00:21:50,917
If Odo was

491
00:21:50,955 --> 00:21:53,449
a Dominion infiltrator,
he could've killed you.

492
00:21:53,494 --> 00:21:54,587
Or replaced you...

493
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,122
the way security is now

494
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:58,695
a changeling could
get anywhere on Earth

495
00:21:58,739 --> 00:22:00,972
replace anyone, even you.

496
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,309
Mr. President

497
00:22:02,347 --> 00:22:05,148
all we want is your permission
to increase security

498
00:22:05,186 --> 00:22:08,284
at Federation and Starfleet
installations here on Earth.

499
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,819
Blood tests will be limited

500
00:22:09,863 --> 00:22:11,799
to high-ranking
Federation officials

501
00:22:11,834 --> 00:22:13,930
Starfleet officers
and their families.

502
00:22:13,972 --> 00:22:15,031
The average citizen

503
00:22:15,075 --> 00:22:16,772
won't even notice
the difference.

504
00:22:16,812 --> 00:22:19,751
I wish these security measures
were not necessary

505
00:22:19,785 --> 00:22:22,917
but the safety of Earth
and the entire Federation

506
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:24,258
depends on them.

507
00:22:24,295 --> 00:22:27,165
You present
a convincing argument, Captain.

508
00:22:27,202 --> 00:22:30,973
It seems I have no choice
but to accept your proposals.

509
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:32,342
Thank you, sir.

510
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,679
Don't thank me.

511
00:22:33,716 --> 00:22:35,686
If I could think
of another solution

512
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,915
I would use it.

513
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:39,519
It took centuries
for Earth to evolve

514
00:22:39,629 --> 00:22:42,192
into the peaceful haven
it is today.

515
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:47,076
I would hate to be remembered
as the Federation President

516
00:22:47,112 --> 00:22:49,105
who destroyed paradise.

517
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:52,646
We're not looking to destroy
paradise, Mr. President.

518
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,683
We're looking to save it.

519
00:23:01,677 --> 00:23:03,203
Activate the phaser.

520
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,031
That's enough.

521
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,839
How do you feel?

522
00:23:16,877 --> 00:23:18,312
Well...

523
00:23:18,347 --> 00:23:21,411
that time I definitely
experienced discomfort.

524
00:23:21,454 --> 00:23:23,014
What was the setting?

525
00:23:23,058 --> 00:23:24,287
Three point one.

526
00:23:24,327 --> 00:23:26,696
If we set
the phasers at 3.4

527
00:23:26,732 --> 00:23:29,397
we should be able to stun
any changeling we hit

528
00:23:29,438 --> 00:23:31,932
and force them back
into a gelatinous state.

529
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:35,212
I'd push it to 3.5,
just to be on the safe side.

530
00:23:35,251 --> 00:23:37,484
But, if you want to do
any more tests

531
00:23:37,523 --> 00:23:39,858
you'll have to get
another guinea pig.

532
00:23:39,895 --> 00:23:42,868
I've been shot quite enough
for one day.

533
00:23:42,901 --> 00:23:44,393
3.5 it is.

534
00:23:44,437 --> 00:23:45,929
I want these units installed

535
00:23:45,974 --> 00:23:48,605
in every room at Starfleet
and Federation Headquarters.

536
00:23:48,713 --> 00:23:51,116
Then start working
on the orbital stations.

537
00:23:51,152 --> 00:23:53,487
We'll have them in place
by tomorrow night.

538
00:23:53,524 --> 00:23:55,153
I want to thank you, Captain.

539
00:23:55,194 --> 00:23:56,493
Thank me? For what?

540
00:23:56,531 --> 00:23:58,023
For convincing the President

541
00:23:58,068 --> 00:24:00,038
to implement
these security measures.

542
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:02,737
It feels like we're
finally on the right track.

543
00:24:03,881 --> 00:24:07,377
Ha. You'd think she
would have thanked me as well.

544
00:24:07,422 --> 00:24:10,326
I'm the one who got shot
13 times today.

545
00:24:10,361 --> 00:24:11,522
Captain Sisko.

546
00:24:11,564 --> 00:24:13,899
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

547
00:24:13,936 --> 00:24:15,929
We were just about finished.

548
00:24:15,974 --> 00:24:18,343
Can I speak to you for a minute?

549
00:24:18,379 --> 00:24:19,506
In private?

550
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,090
Captain, I just want to say

551
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:26,186
I appreciate everything you've
done for me so far, and...

552
00:24:26,229 --> 00:24:29,361
Jake says you're having
difficulty in school.

553
00:24:29,403 --> 00:24:30,832
He told you that?!

554
00:24:30,965 --> 00:24:32,491
He tells me everything.

555
00:24:32,535 --> 00:24:34,164
I don't want you
to get the wrong idea!

556
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,004
Nog, you and I both knew

557
00:24:36,043 --> 00:24:37,170
that it was going
to take a while

558
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,113
for you to adjust to the Academy

559
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,383
and for the Academy
to adjust to you.

560
00:24:41,422 --> 00:24:43,187
I know, but it turned out to be

561
00:24:43,226 --> 00:24:45,162
even more difficult
than I expected.

562
00:24:45,196 --> 00:24:46,790
You're just going to
have to stick with it.

563
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:47,892
And I intend to.

564
00:24:47,936 --> 00:24:50,203
In fact, I think I've come up
with something

565
00:24:50,274 --> 00:24:52,073
to help me make
some new friends.

566
00:24:52,111 --> 00:24:53,101
- Good.
- But I need your help.

567
00:24:54,885 --> 00:24:56,912
I want to join Red Squad.

568
00:24:58,994 --> 00:25:00,087
Red Squad?

569
00:25:00,129 --> 00:25:01,358
What do you think?

570
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,495
I don't know what to think,
I've never heard of it.

571
00:25:03,537 --> 00:25:05,974
It's an elite squad
of cadets at the Academy.

572
00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:07,706
You know, the best of the best.

573
00:25:07,746 --> 00:25:10,047
They get special classes,
simulated missions

574
00:25:10,085 --> 00:25:12,648
off-campus training sessions,
all kinds of things.

575
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:15,059
A group of elite cadets?

576
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:19,835
They never had anything like
that when I was at the Academy.

577
00:25:19,873 --> 00:25:21,172
Oh, it's pretty new.

578
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:24,376
It's a way of rewarding
excellence among the cadets.

579
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:26,113
I have the grades to qualify

580
00:25:26,153 --> 00:25:29,490
but I need to be sponsored
by a high-ranking officer.

581
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:32,192
Ah, and you want me
to put your name in

582
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:34,032
for consideration?

583
00:25:34,071 --> 00:25:37,978
All I'm asking for
is a chance to prove myself.

584
00:25:38,012 --> 00:25:40,677
I... I'm kind of busy
right now, Nog.

585
00:25:44,093 --> 00:25:47,396
But if I get the chance,
I'll see what I can do.

586
00:25:47,434 --> 00:25:48,767
Thank you, sir!

587
00:25:48,803 --> 00:25:50,397
This means a lot to me.

588
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,739
I can see that.

589
00:25:51,776 --> 00:25:53,473
Dismissed, Cadet.

590
00:25:53,513 --> 00:25:55,574
Yes, sir.

591
00:26:09,081 --> 00:26:10,983
Well, look who's here.

592
00:26:11,018 --> 00:26:13,011
Come in, stranger.

593
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:15,520
Sorry.

594
00:26:15,561 --> 00:26:18,728
I haven't been around
much lately.

595
00:26:18,768 --> 00:26:21,900
Oh, things have gotten
a little busy.

596
00:26:24,781 --> 00:26:27,252
You want to tell me about it?

597
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:28,916
I'm afraid I can't.

598
00:26:28,957 --> 00:26:31,588
You'd think that Admiral
could spare you

599
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,695
for a few hours a day
to visit your father.

600
00:26:34,737 --> 00:26:36,468
With you in San Francisco

601
00:26:36,508 --> 00:26:39,811
and Jake off visiting
that school in New Zealand

602
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:42,650
it's like the two of you
aren't even here.

603
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:45,592
You know, Dad, you
could come and visit us

604
00:26:45,627 --> 00:26:47,688
at the station once in a while.

605
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:49,326
Don't start that again.

606
00:26:49,369 --> 00:26:51,772
Earth's my home,
it's where I belong.

607
00:26:51,808 --> 00:26:54,644
Besides, what would happen
to the restaurant

608
00:26:54,681 --> 00:26:57,346
if I went gallivanting
around the galaxy?

609
00:26:57,454 --> 00:27:00,586
You think Nathan can handle
this place on his own?

610
00:27:00,627 --> 00:27:02,426
Nathan will be running
things around here

611
00:27:02,465 --> 00:27:03,626
sooner than you think

612
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:05,900
if you don't take
better care of yourself.

613
00:27:05,939 --> 00:27:07,203
I had a talk with your doctor.

614
00:27:07,242 --> 00:27:08,267
And he tells me that you

615
00:27:08,311 --> 00:27:10,178
haven't been in to see him
for eight months.

616
00:27:10,215 --> 00:27:11,582
The man's an idiot.

617
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:13,749
He's lived in New Orleans
20 years

618
00:27:13,789 --> 00:27:15,691
and can't tell the difference

619
00:27:15,728 --> 00:27:17,961
between Creole food
and Cajun food.

620
00:27:17,999 --> 00:27:20,300
Maybe not, but he can
tell the difference

621
00:27:20,337 --> 00:27:21,806
between a healthy body

622
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:24,278
and one with progressive
atherosclerosis.

623
00:27:24,313 --> 00:27:26,146
He says that if you
don't come in

624
00:27:26,183 --> 00:27:28,016
for vascular
regeneration therapy

625
00:27:28,054 --> 00:27:31,357
that this restaurant will
be looking for a new owner.

626
00:27:31,395 --> 00:27:37,102
Ben, at my age, staying
healthy is a full-time job

627
00:27:37,141 --> 00:27:41,173
and I am too old
to work two jobs.

628
00:27:41,216 --> 00:27:44,587
Now, how long
until you're due back

629
00:27:44,624 --> 00:27:46,560
at Starfleet Headquarters?

630
00:27:46,595 --> 00:27:48,497
I've got about an hour.

631
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:52,736
Just enough time to take a walk
to Audubon Park.

632
00:27:52,775 --> 00:27:55,372
You up for a stroll
with your old man?

633
00:27:57,118 --> 00:28:00,889
I can't think of anything
I'd rather do.

634
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:06,800
Nathan, don't forget
to stir the gumbo.

635
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,817
Odo.

636
00:28:19,367 --> 00:28:21,064
That was really something.

637
00:28:21,104 --> 00:28:23,632
I've never seen you
imitate a life-form before.

638
00:28:23,676 --> 00:28:26,945
Well, I was just taking
a little aerial tour

639
00:28:26,984 --> 00:28:28,351
of San Francisco.

640
00:28:28,387 --> 00:28:29,788
It's quite nice.

641
00:28:29,823 --> 00:28:31,919
Not as ancient
as the cities on Bajor

642
00:28:31,961 --> 00:28:33,294
but almost as impressive.

643
00:28:33,331 --> 00:28:35,164
Makes me wonder
how many other changelings

644
00:28:35,202 --> 00:28:36,899
might be flying around
up there.

645
00:28:36,939 --> 00:28:40,435
If all they're doing is flying
around imitating sea gulls

646
00:28:40,513 --> 00:28:42,643
we don't have much
to worry about.

647
00:28:42,685 --> 00:28:44,450
I doubt that other changelings

648
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:46,857
are wasting their time
imitating birds.

649
00:28:46,894 --> 00:28:49,331
They don't all share
Odo's lack of skill

650
00:28:49,366 --> 00:28:51,393
when it comes
to mimicking humans.

651
00:28:51,437 --> 00:28:53,270
That's right, they don't.

652
00:28:53,308 --> 00:28:55,939
I'm glad
you're keeping that in mind.

653
00:28:55,981 --> 00:28:57,473
Well, if you ask me

654
00:28:57,518 --> 00:29:00,183
that was a pretty
convincing sea gull.

655
00:29:00,224 --> 00:29:01,625
Thank you.

656
00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:04,894
Though I'm not sure
the gulls would agree.

657
00:29:04,933 --> 00:29:07,427
Commander, I think we've taken
up enough of Mr. Odo's time.

658
00:29:09,244 --> 00:29:10,212
Keep practicing.

659
00:29:10,246 --> 00:29:12,113
You'll have those birds
fooled in no time.

660
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:13,242
- Admiral?
- Yes.

661
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:14,777
I know that Starfleet Command

662
00:29:14,822 --> 00:29:16,416
has always been a little uneasy

663
00:29:16,459 --> 00:29:18,828
about a changeling
working in their midst.

664
00:29:18,864 --> 00:29:21,335
I just wanted to say
how much I appreciate

665
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,841
the trust you've shown in me.

666
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:25,036
Thank you.

667
00:29:25,078 --> 00:29:26,307
You're welcome.

668
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,497
Well done, Odo.

669
00:29:36,771 --> 00:29:37,864
Are you all right?

670
00:29:39,108 --> 00:29:40,577
I'm fine.

671
00:29:47,628 --> 00:29:50,327
How did you know he wasn't me?

672
00:29:50,367 --> 00:29:52,337
Oh, I'm not sure exactly.

673
00:29:52,371 --> 00:29:54,672
It's as if I could feel

674
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,908
the changeling's
hostility toward me.

675
00:29:56,948 --> 00:29:58,281
You're the only changeling

676
00:29:58,317 --> 00:30:00,344
who's ever harmed
one of his own people.

677
00:30:00,389 --> 00:30:02,553
I'm sure that hasn't
made you many friends.

678
00:30:02,661 --> 00:30:06,294
What I'd like to know is
why was he imitating me.

679
00:30:06,335 --> 00:30:08,202
You have access to all
our security procedures

680
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,572
all our protocols,
that makes you

681
00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:10,908
a logical target.

682
00:30:10,946 --> 00:30:12,245
I suppose so.

683
00:30:12,281 --> 00:30:14,411
The bottom line is,
a changeling infiltrated

684
00:30:14,453 --> 00:30:15,752
the grounds
of Starfleet Headquarters

685
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:18,226
imitated the Admiral,
and got away scot-free.

686
00:30:18,261 --> 00:30:19,890
Our security measures
aren't working.

687
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:22,698
We're doing everything
the President will let us do.

688
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:25,039
Maybe that's not enough.

689
00:30:25,076 --> 00:30:27,012
We could talk
to the President again.

690
00:30:27,048 --> 00:30:29,611
I'm afraid that would
be a waste of time.

691
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,624
Jaresh-lnyo would be
a fine President in peacetime

692
00:30:32,694 --> 00:30:34,493
but we have a war on our hands

693
00:30:34,531 --> 00:30:37,298
and he doesn't seem
to understand that.

694
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:41,175
All he cares about
is not upsetting people.

695
00:30:41,212 --> 00:30:45,620
But humans are tougher
than he thinks.

696
00:30:45,655 --> 00:30:47,454
We've created a paradise here

697
00:30:47,492 --> 00:30:49,986
and we're willing to fight
to protect it.

698
00:30:50,031 --> 00:30:52,662
And you think the President
isn't willing to fight.

699
00:30:52,771 --> 00:30:56,678
I think the President
is a long way from home.

700
00:30:56,779 --> 00:30:58,442
This isn't his world.

701
00:30:58,484 --> 00:31:00,717
We can't expect him to care
about it the way we do.

702
00:31:01,824 --> 00:31:03,123
Sisko here.

703
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,461
Captain, your son's trying
to contact you.

704
00:31:05,499 --> 00:31:06,467
He says it's urgent.

705
00:31:06,501 --> 00:31:07,628
Put him through.

706
00:31:11,145 --> 00:31:13,776
Dad, you'd better get down here
right away.

707
00:31:13,817 --> 00:31:14,978
What's wrong?

708
00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:16,146
It's Grandpa.

709
00:31:16,189 --> 00:31:17,624
He's been arrested.

710
00:31:27,546 --> 00:31:28,845
What's going on here?

711
00:31:28,883 --> 00:31:31,013
Captain, we never meant for
things to get out of hand.

712
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,456
What did you think
would happen...

713
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,155
storming in here
and accusing me and my grandson

714
00:31:35,197 --> 00:31:37,167
of being a couple
of shape-shifters?

715
00:31:37,201 --> 00:31:40,174
We never accused you of being
a shape-shifter, Mr. Sisko.

716
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:42,441
We were just carrying out
our orders.

717
00:31:42,479 --> 00:31:44,746
All family members
of Starfleet personnel

718
00:31:44,784 --> 00:31:47,221
are required to submit
to blood screenings.

719
00:31:47,256 --> 00:31:48,725
No exceptions.

720
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,231
That's the most ridiculous thing
I ever heard of.

721
00:31:51,265 --> 00:31:52,734
Do you believe that?

722
00:31:52,769 --> 00:31:54,967
I should.
I signed the orders myself.

723
00:31:55,007 --> 00:31:58,674
Now why would you go and do
a stupid thing like that?

724
00:31:58,715 --> 00:32:00,742
Dad, it has to be done.

725
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:01,754
Grandpa, look.

726
00:32:01,788 --> 00:32:03,189
I'll take the test first.

727
00:32:03,225 --> 00:32:04,386
Go ahead.

728
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:12,769
Now me.

729
00:32:12,813 --> 00:32:14,442
Sir, that's not necessary.

730
00:32:14,483 --> 00:32:15,975
Do it anyway.

731
00:32:30,518 --> 00:32:32,181
It's your turn.

732
00:32:32,222 --> 00:32:35,718
Jake, do you think
I'm a shape-shifter?

733
00:32:35,763 --> 00:32:37,357
Come on, Grandpa.

734
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,302
Answer the question.

735
00:32:39,337 --> 00:32:42,310
No, I don't think
you're a shape-shifter.

736
00:32:42,344 --> 00:32:45,077
At least somebody in my family
has some sense.

737
00:32:45,117 --> 00:32:46,085
Dad!

738
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,247
I don't want to hear about it.

739
00:32:47,288 --> 00:32:49,121
You take these two vampires
and tell them

740
00:32:49,226 --> 00:32:50,786
to either sit down
and grab a menu

741
00:32:50,829 --> 00:32:52,526
or get out of my restaurant.

742
00:32:52,566 --> 00:32:54,297
Jake, get them a menu.

743
00:32:54,337 --> 00:32:55,966
But, sir...

744
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,478
I would recommend
the shrimp creole.

745
00:32:58,513 --> 00:32:59,914
Look, Dad...

746
00:32:59,949 --> 00:33:01,144
I don't want to hear it.

747
00:33:01,186 --> 00:33:02,655
Listen to me...

748
00:33:02,688 --> 00:33:04,658
you have got to take the test.

749
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:06,094
Why should I?

750
00:33:06,197 --> 00:33:08,099
If I was an enemy spy

751
00:33:08,134 --> 00:33:10,799
looking to replace someone,
I think I could

752
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,676
come up with better choices
than an old chef.

753
00:33:13,713 --> 00:33:18,554
Yeah, you're probably right,
but this isn't about you.

754
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:21,323
We've got civilian families
living on starships

755
00:33:21,363 --> 00:33:24,461
and Starfleet installations
all over the Federation.

756
00:33:24,504 --> 00:33:27,135
The only way we can
secure those facilities

757
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:29,043
is to test everyone there

758
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,278
whether they wear
a uniform or not.

759
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:34,120
I'm not living
on a Starfleet installation.

760
00:33:34,158 --> 00:33:36,686
Dad, if we test
the family members

761
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:40,431
of one Starfleet officer,
we must test them all.

762
00:33:40,472 --> 00:33:42,169
You may want to test everyone

763
00:33:42,243 --> 00:33:44,714
but that doesn't mean
we all have to cooperate.

764
00:33:44,748 --> 00:33:47,049
I didn't take
an oath to Starfleet.

765
00:33:47,087 --> 00:33:50,788
Neither did Jake or your sister
or anyone in your family.

766
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:53,629
We have rights, Ben,
including the right

767
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:57,107
to be as stubborn
or thickheaded as we want.

768
00:33:57,142 --> 00:33:58,771
Damn it, Dad!

769
00:33:58,812 --> 00:34:02,617
Can't you cooperate
just one time?

770
00:34:02,654 --> 00:34:04,317
You don't take your medication.

771
00:34:04,357 --> 00:34:05,826
You don't go to the doctor.

772
00:34:05,861 --> 00:34:08,731
You won't let Judith help
you in the restaurant.

773
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:12,264
Just one time, please
do what you're asked.

774
00:34:12,309 --> 00:34:14,746
I wish I could

775
00:34:14,781 --> 00:34:17,913
but what you're
asking me to do is wrong.

776
00:34:17,954 --> 00:34:21,952
You can't go around
making people prove they are

777
00:34:21,996 --> 00:34:23,329
who they say they are.

778
00:34:23,366 --> 00:34:24,665
That's no way to live

779
00:34:24,703 --> 00:34:26,673
and I'm not going
to go along with it.

780
00:34:26,707 --> 00:34:29,942
Now, if you want
to make yourself useful

781
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,577
start some water boiling
for the shrimp.

782
00:34:32,619 --> 00:34:34,646
Come on, Dad.

783
00:34:34,691 --> 00:34:36,593
Don't be this way.

784
00:34:36,628 --> 00:34:39,498
If I have to,
I will get a warrant...

785
00:34:39,534 --> 00:34:40,833
And what?

786
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:44,903
Hold me down and force me
to give you my blood?

787
00:34:44,947 --> 00:34:46,644
Because that's the only way
you'll get...

788
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:48,677
Damn it!

789
00:34:48,721 --> 00:34:50,954
Now look what I've done.

790
00:35:03,454 --> 00:35:04,581
Jake?

791
00:35:05,626 --> 00:35:07,118
Yeah?

792
00:35:07,163 --> 00:35:10,432
I've got a dermal regenerator
under the...

793
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:13,237
Benjamin Lafayette Sisko.

794
00:35:13,309 --> 00:35:16,076
What the hell
has gotten into your head?

795
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:19,350
You actually thought
I was one of them, didn't you?

796
00:35:19,389 --> 00:35:22,692
I don't know.
I wasn't sure.

797
00:35:22,729 --> 00:35:25,530
This business has got you
so twisted around

798
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,472
you, you can't think straight.

799
00:35:27,507 --> 00:35:30,206
You're seeing shape-shifters
everywhere.

800
00:35:30,246 --> 00:35:34,051
Maybe you ought to think
about something for a minute.

801
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:36,286
If I was
a smart shape-shifter...

802
00:35:36,393 --> 00:35:39,491
a really good one...
the first thing I would do

803
00:35:39,533 --> 00:35:42,631
would be to grab
some poor soul off the street

804
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:46,272
absorb every ounce of his blood
and let it out on cue

805
00:35:46,314 --> 00:35:49,218
whenever someone like you
tried to test me.

806
00:35:49,255 --> 00:35:50,815
Don't you see?

807
00:35:50,858 --> 00:35:53,489
There isn't a test
that's been created

808
00:35:53,531 --> 00:35:56,196
a smart man
can't find his way around.

809
00:35:56,236 --> 00:35:59,003
You aren't going
to catch shape-shifters

810
00:35:59,043 --> 00:36:00,672
using some gadget.

811
00:36:00,713 --> 00:36:04,209
The only thing
you can count on in this life...

812
00:36:05,891 --> 00:36:06,756
Grandpa!

813
00:36:13,341 --> 00:36:16,473
The EMTs said he'd be okay
and they were right.

814
00:36:16,515 --> 00:36:18,007
It turns out
it was just a mild stroke

815
00:36:18,052 --> 00:36:20,421
brought on
by his atherosclerosis.

816
00:36:20,456 --> 00:36:22,950
How's Jake handling it?

817
00:36:22,995 --> 00:36:24,794
He is very upset.

818
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:26,062
He knows as well as I do

819
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:29,405
that if my father doesn't
take better care of himself...

820
00:36:30,746 --> 00:36:33,742
I've found that when it comes
to doing what's best for you

821
00:36:33,785 --> 00:36:35,949
you humanoids
have the distressing habit

822
00:36:35,991 --> 00:36:37,545
of doing the exact opposite.

823
00:36:37,678 --> 00:36:39,648
I can't argue with that.

824
00:36:39,682 --> 00:36:43,053
But what bothers me is

825
00:36:43,091 --> 00:36:46,656
that for a few moments there,
I really believed

826
00:36:46,698 --> 00:36:48,794
that my own father
was a changeling.

827
00:36:48,836 --> 00:36:53,141
A reasonable assumption
considering the circumstances.

828
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:58,282
I don't care
if it's reasonable or not...

829
00:36:58,324 --> 00:37:00,921
but when a son
can't trust his own father...

830
00:37:00,963 --> 00:37:03,230
That's why my people
came here...

831
00:37:03,268 --> 00:37:06,969
to undermine the trust
and mutual understanding

832
00:37:07,009 --> 00:37:08,444
the Federation is built on.

833
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:10,575
But what if my father's right?

834
00:37:10,618 --> 00:37:12,885
What if all our precautions
turn out to be useless?

835
00:37:12,922 --> 00:37:16,988
Maybe they will, but that
doesn't mean you should give up.

836
00:37:17,031 --> 00:37:18,330
My people are here

837
00:37:18,368 --> 00:37:21,204
and you've got to fight them
with whatever you've got.

838
00:37:23,779 --> 00:37:27,480
I hope you don't take this
the wrong way, Constable

839
00:37:27,521 --> 00:37:32,989
but there are times I wish
you'd never found your people.

840
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:38,143
Believe me, Captain...

841
00:37:38,178 --> 00:37:41,515
sometimes I feel the same way.

842
00:37:45,494 --> 00:37:47,727
Grandpa, would you
please sit down?

843
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:48,825
Enjoy your meal.

844
00:37:48,868 --> 00:37:51,932
Your food will be right out.

845
00:37:56,919 --> 00:37:59,015
What's that look
supposed to mean?

846
00:37:59,057 --> 00:38:00,856
You sat down.

847
00:38:00,895 --> 00:38:03,128
Damn right I sat down.

848
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:05,103
I feel terrible.

849
00:38:05,137 --> 00:38:06,538
You should be in bed.

850
00:38:06,574 --> 00:38:09,547
Jake, the only time
you should be in bed

851
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,177
is if you're sleeping, dying

852
00:38:12,219 --> 00:38:14,918
or making love
to a beautiful woman.

853
00:38:16,428 --> 00:38:19,161
I'm not tired, I'm not dying

854
00:38:19,202 --> 00:38:23,109
and the truth is,
I'm too old for beautiful women

855
00:38:23,143 --> 00:38:25,637
so I might as well be here.

856
00:38:25,683 --> 00:38:28,747
Your father's the one
you should be worried about.

857
00:38:28,789 --> 00:38:30,418
Dad? Why?

858
00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:32,326
I've never seen him so tense.

859
00:38:32,364 --> 00:38:33,993
It's like he's carrying

860
00:38:34,034 --> 00:38:36,471
the weight of the world
on his shoulders.

861
00:38:36,505 --> 00:38:38,202
He is.

862
00:38:39,713 --> 00:38:42,412
I suppose he is, at that.

863
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:45,015
What happened?

864
00:38:45,058 --> 00:38:46,527
I don't know.

865
00:38:46,562 --> 00:38:48,692
The whole block's dark.

866
00:38:49,735 --> 00:38:51,136
Are you all right?

867
00:38:51,171 --> 00:38:52,298
I'm fine.

868
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,934
Admiral, what's going on?

869
00:38:53,977 --> 00:38:55,810
From what we can tell, Earth's

870
00:38:55,849 --> 00:38:58,343
entire power relay system's
been knocked off line.

871
00:38:58,388 --> 00:39:01,019
Even Starfleet's emergency
backup's been affected.

872
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,757
How could that happen?
I don't know

873
00:39:02,864 --> 00:39:04,925
but if you ask me, there's only
one possible explanation...

874
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:05,937
Sabotage.

875
00:39:05,971 --> 00:39:07,338
The changelings.

876
00:39:07,373 --> 00:39:08,774
Take out the power relays

877
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,677
and you neutralize
sensors, transporters

878
00:39:10,714 --> 00:39:12,707
surface-based defense
installations...

879
00:39:12,752 --> 00:39:16,021
In other words,
Earth is defenseless.

880
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:20,092
If the Dominion attacks now,
we don't stand a chance.

881
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,151
I'm not interested in excuses.

882
00:39:28,186 --> 00:39:29,347
It is imperative

883
00:39:29,389 --> 00:39:32,156
we get the power relay system
functioning again.

884
00:39:35,903 --> 00:39:37,497
Mr. President.

885
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,100
How did you people get here?

886
00:39:39,144 --> 00:39:43,017
We contacted the <i>Lakota</i>
and used their transporters.

887
00:39:43,052 --> 00:39:46,082
Mr. President,
as acting head of Earth Security

888
00:39:46,126 --> 00:39:49,361
I must advise you
to declare a state of emergency.

889
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,871
You're serious.

890
00:39:51,905 --> 00:39:53,738
With the exception
of the Borg incident

891
00:39:53,776 --> 00:39:55,575
there hasn't been
a state of emergency

892
00:39:55,613 --> 00:39:57,139
declared on Earth in a century.

893
00:39:57,183 --> 00:39:58,880
I am aware of that

894
00:39:58,987 --> 00:40:02,290
but I have reason to believe
that a Dominion war fleet

895
00:40:02,327 --> 00:40:04,560
may be in the Alpha Quadrant
headed for Earth.

896
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:06,695
Do you have evidence
to back this up?

897
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,799
Just before we left Deep Space 9

898
00:40:08,842 --> 00:40:11,746
the wormhole was exhibiting
some unusual behavior...

899
00:40:11,782 --> 00:40:14,253
opening and closing
for no apparent reason.

900
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:16,919
We didn't detect any ships
coming through at the time

901
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,827
but the Dominion
might have been using

902
00:40:18,864 --> 00:40:20,731
some kind
of cloaking technology.

903
00:40:20,768 --> 00:40:23,707
I wasn't aware the Dominion
had cloaking technology.

904
00:40:23,741 --> 00:40:26,144
The combined Cardassian
and Romulan fleet

905
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:29,084
that the Dominion destroyed
in the Gamma Quadrant

906
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,353
was equipped
with cloaking devices.

907
00:40:31,391 --> 00:40:34,831
Who knows what my people might
have taken from the wreckage.

908
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:37,360
How long
till the power relays are fixed?

909
00:40:37,404 --> 00:40:39,101
From what we can tell,
the changelings

910
00:40:39,142 --> 00:40:40,668
infected the system
with some kind

911
00:40:40,712 --> 00:40:42,443
of self-replicating
computer protocol.

912
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:44,976
It jumped from one
power relay to the next

913
00:40:45,055 --> 00:40:47,356
disrupting every system
it came in contact with.

914
00:40:47,393 --> 00:40:49,124
The only way
to correct the problem

915
00:40:49,164 --> 00:40:52,626
is to shut down the entire grid,
purge all the operating systems

916
00:40:52,672 --> 00:40:54,471
and restart the relays.

917
00:40:54,509 --> 00:40:56,001
And that could take days.

918
00:40:56,113 --> 00:40:58,015
Which is why it is imperative

919
00:40:58,117 --> 00:41:00,850
that you declare
a state of emergency.

920
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:02,189
What good will that do

921
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:04,459
when we have no way
to defend ourselves?

922
00:41:04,498 --> 00:41:06,525
Mr. President, we can use

923
00:41:06,569 --> 00:41:09,132
the <i>Lakota's</i> transporters
and communications system

924
00:41:09,174 --> 00:41:11,475
to mobilize
every Starfleet officer on Earth

925
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:12,708
in less than 12 hours.

926
00:41:12,749 --> 00:41:13,717
We've been preparing

927
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:15,482
for something like this
for a long time.

928
00:41:15,522 --> 00:41:17,720
We have stockpiles
of phaser rifles

929
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,993
personal force fields,
photon grenades...

930
00:41:20,031 --> 00:41:21,500
enough to equip an entire army.

931
00:41:21,535 --> 00:41:24,234
I can start getting men
on the streets immediately.

932
00:41:24,275 --> 00:41:27,476
What you're asking me to do
is declare martial law.

933
00:41:27,514 --> 00:41:31,010
What I'm asking you to do is
let us defend this planet.

934
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:34,029
We don't know what
the changelings will do next

935
00:41:34,096 --> 00:41:36,397
but we have to be
ready for them.

936
00:41:36,434 --> 00:41:38,028
Ben, tell him.

937
00:41:38,105 --> 00:41:43,709
Sir, the thought of filling
the streets with armed troops

938
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:47,282
is as disturbing to me
as it is to you

939
00:41:47,325 --> 00:41:48,885
but not as disturbing

940
00:41:48,928 --> 00:41:51,058
as the thought
of a Jem'Hadar army

941
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,367
landing on Earth
without opposition.

942
00:41:53,405 --> 00:41:55,466
The Jem'Hadar are
the most brutal

943
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:58,380
and efficient soldiers
I've ever encountered.

944
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:01,217
They don't care about
the conventions of war

945
00:42:01,256 --> 00:42:02,987
or protecting civilians.

946
00:42:03,026 --> 00:42:06,431
They will not limit themselves
to military targets.

947
00:42:06,467 --> 00:42:08,494
They'll be waging
the kind of war

948
00:42:08,539 --> 00:42:12,001
Earth hasn't seen since
the founding of the Federation.

949
00:42:12,046 --> 00:42:14,279
At the same time,
my people will continue

950
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:17,051
to undermine Earth's defenses
in any way they can.

951
00:42:17,091 --> 00:42:19,392
This power outage
is only the beginning.

952
00:42:19,429 --> 00:42:23,200
I never sought this job.

953
00:42:23,237 --> 00:42:26,836
I was content
to simply represent my people

954
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:29,214
on the Federation Council.

955
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:32,086
When they asked me
to submit my name for election

956
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,217
I almost said no.

957
00:42:34,261 --> 00:42:36,664
Today, I wish I had.

958
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,297
We appreciate your feelings,
Mr. President

959
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,504
but we don't have time
for regrets.

960
00:42:41,544 --> 00:42:43,514
You accepted the job
and now it's yours.

961
00:42:43,549 --> 00:42:45,382
Mr. President

962
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,789
there are people
all over this planet right now

963
00:42:47,825 --> 00:42:50,992
huddled in the dark, terrified
about what might happen next.

964
00:42:51,032 --> 00:42:53,663
They're waiting for a sign,
something to reassure them

965
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:55,264
that everything
will be all right

966
00:42:55,308 --> 00:42:57,677
but they won't wait long.

967
00:42:57,713 --> 00:43:00,914
Fear is a powerful
and dangerous thing

968
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:01,943
and if you don't act

969
00:43:01,989 --> 00:43:04,050
if you don't show them
that they're not alone

970
00:43:04,093 --> 00:43:07,624
then fear will surely take over.

971
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:10,367
Give us the authority
we need, Mr. President

972
00:43:10,408 --> 00:43:13,209
and we will take
care of the rest.

973
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:28,340
Earth is in your hands,
gentlemen.

974
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,350
Do what needs to be done.

975
00:43:30,385 --> 00:43:32,014
Thank you, sir.

976
00:43:32,055 --> 00:43:34,458
You've made the right decision.

977
00:43:34,494 --> 00:43:37,364
I hope you're right...

978
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,099
for all our sakes.

979
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:50,658
Grandpa?

980
00:43:50,696 --> 00:43:52,495
Grandpa, wake up!

981
00:43:52,533 --> 00:43:53,832
I'm not sleeping.

982
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:55,840
I'm checking
my eyelids for holes.

983
00:43:55,874 --> 00:43:58,175
You'd better come
take a look at this.

984
00:43:58,212 --> 00:44:00,011
Take a look at what?

985
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:01,245
Come on.
