1
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:05,005
DAX:
There it goes again.

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:09,009
That's the seventh time
in the last two hours.

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,762
Still no idea
what's causing it?

4
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:13,806
It seems to be
opening and closing

5
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:15,641
completely at random.

6
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,392
No unusual readings.

7
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,144
No ships coming through.

8
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:21,355
For all we know,
the Bajorans are right.

9
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,315
Maybe it is a message
from the Prophets.

10
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:24,900
Emissary.

11
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,403
Hmm. If it is,
they didn't tell me.

12
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,656
Maybe the Prophets
don't recognize you

13
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,157
with the new beard.

14
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:35,243
There must be a scientific
explanation for this.

15
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,166
DAX:
Here we go.

16
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,211
Something funny, old man?

17
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,296
Hmm? No, nothing.

18
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,216
WORF:
Ops to Captain Sisko.
Sisko here.

19
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,719
Captain, we are receiving
a priority one message

20
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:52,845
from Starfleet Security.

21
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:54,429
On my way.

22
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:02,437
Then the Andorian says,
"That's<i> not</i> my antenna."

23
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:07,234
Why do I bother?
Quark!

24
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:10,696
What can I do for
you, Constable?

25
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,113
Dax... where is she?

26
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,199
She's not here.

27
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,618
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

28
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,120
You find all this very funny,
don't you?

29
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,081
You and Dax
probably planned it together.

30
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,876
Planned what?
Moving my furniture.

31
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:25,544
Is that what this
is all about?

32
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,462
Someone moved
your furniture?

33
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,464
Not<i> someone--</i> Commander Dax.

34
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,718
It's the fourth time
she's done it this past year.

35
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,470
She breaks into my quarters
while I'm regenerating,

36
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,180
and moves all my furniture
out of alignment.

37
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,350
Shifts one piece
three centimeters to the right,

38
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,853
the next
four centimeters to the left.

39
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,146
Not one object in my quarters

40
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,148
is where
it's supposed to be.

41
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,150
And... is that a bad thing?

42
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,321
Everything I own is carefully
and painstakingly arranged.

43
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,573
Dax knows this,

44
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:57,076
and yet she takes
a perverse delight

45
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:59,453
in throwing
my quarters into chaos.

46
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,623
I'd hardly call three
centimeters "chaos."

47
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,500
Maybe you wouldn't,
but I do.

48
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,962
You humanoids are all alike.

49
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:09,838
You have no sense of order,

50
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:14,259
and Dax is the<i> most</i>
humanoid person I know.

51
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,803
Sisko to Constable Odo.

52
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,012
Odo here.

53
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,263
Please report to Ops
immediately.

54
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,389
Acknowledged.

55
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,225
Uh, when you see Dax,

56
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,560
say hello to her for me.

57
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,110
How many people were
at the conference?

58
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,613
27, including
the Tholian observer.

59
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,991
27... it's unbelievable.

60
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,159
SISKO:
Federation President

61
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,204
Jaresh-Inyo has declared
a planet-wide day of mourning.

62
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,292
Constable, take a seat.
Of course.

63
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,336
WORF:
Ten minutes ago, we
received a recording

64
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,254
of a high-level
diplomatic conference

65
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,881
that took place
between the Federation

66
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,509
and the Romulan Empire
on Earth two days ago.

67
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:59,930
Computer, begin replay
at time index 5-9-11.

68
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,354
A bomb.

69
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,897
Of unknown composition.

70
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,441
A crime like this hasn't
been committed on Earth

71
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,818
in over a hundred years.

72
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,362
Go back and show him
what you showed us.

73
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:19,033
Computer, restart recording
at time index 5-9-1-6.

74
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,826
One-tenth normal speed.

75
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:23,745
Freeze picture.

76
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,373
Enlarge section F-3
and enhance.

77
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,711
Keep your eye on the
piece of pottery.

78
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,129
Computer,

79
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,881
resume at one-tenth speed.

80
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,260
That's a changeling.

81
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,806
WORF:
No sign of a changeling
was found in the aftermath.

82
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,976
We must assume that
it escaped unharmed.

83
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,854
I was hoping that this
would never happen,

84
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:51,439
but it finally has.

85
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,527
The changelings
have reached Earth.

86
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,608
How's that?

87
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,986
Another centimeter
to the left.

88
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,322
Shouldn't you be
on the<i> Lakota?</i>

89
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:06,283
The<i> Lakota</i> won't depart
for another hour.

90
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,202
Which gives us plenty of time

91
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,829
to repair the damage
you've done to my room.

92
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,748
And while I'm gone, I want
your solemn word that you'll

93
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:14,916
stay out of
my quarters.

94
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,544
You've got it.

95
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,005
So, how long do you think
you and Captain Sisko
will be on Earth?

96
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,715
I have no idea.

97
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:25,593
I just hope this trip
isn't a waste of time.

98
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,804
I'm not sure
what Captain Sisko and I

99
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,848
can tell Starfleet
about my people

100
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:32,684
that hasn't already
been in our reports.

101
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,978
Believe me, Odo,
with changelings on Earth,

102
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,689
Starfleet's going to need
all the help it can get.

103
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,276
There. How's that?

104
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,945
A little more
to the left.

105
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,031
Whatever you say,
Constable.

106
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,744
Wait till you see
the size of the eggplant

107
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,329
I'm getting out
of my garden this year.

108
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,496
As big as Crenshaw melons,

109
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:56,457
and twice as heavy.

110
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,834
So, how is Judith?

111
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,254
She still helping out
in the restaurant?

112
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:02,463
I sent her home to Portland.

113
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,550
Your sister's got
her own life to worry about.

114
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,137
Besides, she never puts enough
cayenne pepper in the jambalaya.

115
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,556
Just like Mom.

116
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,434
Which means she has
no business in the kitchen.

117
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,437
It'll be good to have you
home again, Benjamin.

118
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,106
Jake, too.

119
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:23,484
Dad, you know that this
isn't exactly a vacation.

120
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,362
I'll be spending most
of my time in San Francisco

121
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,114
at Starfleet Headquarters.

122
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,866
Whatever you do during the day
is your business.

123
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,368
But at dinner time,

124
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,703
you better get yourself
down to New Orleans.

125
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,415
No son of mine is going
to eat that replicated slop

126
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:38,292
Starfleet calls food.

127
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,501
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

128
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,503
You won't get any
argument from me.

129
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,507
So, Dad...

130
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,427
you feeling okay?

131
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:51,054
Oh, let's not start that again.

132
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,639
It's just a question.

133
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,641
You look a little tired.

134
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,102
How's the new aorta holding up?

135
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,896
The doctors say
I am a medical marvel.

136
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:03,566
At the rate things are going,
in a year or two

137
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:07,154
I won't have an original organ
left in my body.

138
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,823
They'll write me up
in the medical books.

139
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,284
Well, but you're feeling okay?

140
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:15,745
Just point me in the direction
of a party and a pretty girl,

141
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,664
and I'll show you
how good I feel.

142
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,337
Make sure you call me
as soon as you and Jake get in.

143
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:26,089
Your rooms are always waiting
and ready for you.

144
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,424
I know that, Dad.

145
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,968
We'll be there
before you know it.

146
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,642
Jake-o.

147
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,685
Dad.

148
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,603
You just missed
Grandpa Joe.

149
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,148
Did you tell him we're
staying in San Francisco?

150
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,025
Uh, I didn't quite
get around to it.

151
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,110
Ah. Dad.

152
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,488
You know
if we stay with Grandpa,

153
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:51,490
he's going to put me
to work in the kitchen.

154
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,367
Is that so bad?

155
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,743
Well, chopping vegetables
for nine hours a day

156
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,412
isn't exactly my idea
of a vacation.

157
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,331
Well, Jake, you're
not a child anymore.

158
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:01,958
Grandpa will not expect you
to chop vegetables.

159
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,252
He'll want you to wait tables.

160
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,337
Oh!

161
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,422
(<i> laughs</i> )

162
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,385
Barkeep.

163
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:15,596
So, what can I get
you two flyboys?

164
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,015
A Scotch, neat,

165
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,518
and a pint of your finest
bitter for my mate.

166
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,853
Make it quick.
The cabbage crates
will be coming back

167
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,688
over the briny
any minute now.

168
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,274
All right, all right.
I'd hate to let the Jerries

169
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,693
strafe that green
and pleasant land of yours

170
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,571
while the two of you
were taking time out
to get a drink.

171
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,198
No choice, man.
Ritual, you know.

172
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:36,117
To Clive, the best bloke

173
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,036
ever to prang his kite
into the Channel.

174
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:40,080
Ah, got to keep
a stiff upper lip.

175
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,248
Hear, hear.

176
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,499
Down the hatch.

177
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,675
Ah-ah!

178
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,928
Now, remember what I said
about throwing glasses.

179
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,229
So, you want to go back up

180
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,273
and have another crack
at the Jerries?

181
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,108
Oh, I don't know.

182
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:11,111
To tell you the truth,
my heart isn't in it.

183
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:14,281
Aren't you taking
Clive's death
a little seriously?

184
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,823
After all, he was just
a holosuite character.

185
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:19,035
It's not Clive.
It's Earth.

186
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,662
You probably wouldn't
understand this, Quark,

187
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,707
but when you care
about a place,
and it's in trouble,

188
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,627
and you want to do
something about it
and you can't,

189
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,878
it's very frustrating.

190
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,005
I know exactly what you mean.

191
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:34,842
When the Great Monetary Collapse
hit Ferenginar,

192
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,970
I was hundreds
of light-years away,

193
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,348
serving as a ship's cook
on a long-haul freighter.

194
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:44,018
I can't tell you
the heartbreak I suffered,

195
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:47,730
knowing that rampant inflation
and currency devaluation

196
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,649
were burning
like wildfires

197
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,735
through the lush financial
foliage of my home.

198
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,071
It still depresses me
even today.

199
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,741
I remember thinking
my accounts needed me,

200
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,243
and there was nothing
I could do.

201
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:04,164
I-I-I felt so... so helpless.

202
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,458
So you see...

203
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,709
I do understand.

204
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,504
Somehow, you
telling me that

205
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,922
doesn't make me feel
the least bit better.

206
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,343
Hu-mans.

207
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:19,095
All you care about
is yourselves.

208
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,555
O'BRIEN:
Odo!

209
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,307
Hang on a second.

210
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,646
Well, I take it
the Battle of Britain

211
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,147
has been won yet again.

212
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,524
There's a Spitfire
with your name on it

213
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:31,941
waiting in
the hangar.

214
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,568
When you get
back from Earth

215
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,195
you can take Clive's
place in the squadron.

216
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,988
Somehow I doubt it.

217
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,449
Look, Odo,
do me a favor.

218
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,118
If you get a chance,
stop by and visit
my folks in Dublin.

219
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,620
Just make sure
they're okay, you know?

220
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,246
I'll try to find the time.

221
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,415
Good. I'll let them know
you might drop by.

222
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,668
Anyone I can look up
for you, Doctor?

223
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:52,086
Uh, no, no,
that'll be fine.

224
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,963
Um, just wish I was
coming with you.

225
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,465
Well, to be quite
honest, Doctor,

226
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,258
I wish both of you
were going with me.

227
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,717
I could use the company.

228
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,719
I... I doubt
that a shape-shifter

229
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,972
will be welcome on Earth
at the moment.

230
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,932
No one can hold
you responsible

231
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,059
for what your people
are doing.

232
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,603
Oh, really?

233
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:12,148
Well, I'd better get
over to the<i> Lakota.</i>

234
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,816
We'll be
leaving shortly.

235
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,985
Good luck.

236
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,945
I don't believe in luck.

237
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:21,575
But I appreciate the sentiment.

238
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,581
Well, we better get
out of these uniforms.

239
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,040
Ah.

240
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,339
The<i> Lakota's</i>
gone to warp.

241
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,091
When was the last time
the wormhole opened?

242
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,634
12 hours ago.

243
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,469
Perhaps it has
returned to normal.

244
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,054
I suppose so.

245
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,306
You sound
disappointed, Major.

246
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,183
I guess I am.

247
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,269
Part of me was hoping that
the Prophets were behind it,

248
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,811
that they were finally
going to show themselves

249
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:51,979
to the Bajoran people.

250
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,773
I prefer Klingon beliefs.

251
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:57,068
I supposed your gods
aren't as cryptic as ours.

252
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,986
Our gods are dead.

253
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:02,282
Ancient Klingon warriors
slew them a millennia ago.

254
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,368
They were more trouble
than they were worth.

255
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:09,080
I don't think I'll ever
understand Klingons.

256
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,207
Don't worry
about it, Major.

257
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,542
Nobody does.

258
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,793
That's the way
they like it.

259
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,136
Ben.

260
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,512
Admiral Leyton.

261
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,055
Good to see you
again, sir.

262
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,141
Captain Sisko.
(<i> laughs</i> )

263
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,851
This is my adjutant,
Commander Benteen.

264
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,146
Benjamin was
my executive officer

265
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,522
aboard the<i> Okinawa</i>

266
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,899
and a damn
fine one, too.
I did all right.

267
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,693
BENTEEN:
Ah, don't be modest.

268
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:41,028
Admiral Leyton has had his
share of executive officers

269
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,905
and you're the only one
he ever speaks fondly of.

270
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,241
Present company
excluded.

271
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,410
Admiral Leyton is the one
who recommended me

272
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,787
for the job on Deep Space 9.

273
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:51,372
One of my better ideas.

274
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,957
You must be Odo.

275
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,083
That's right.

276
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,045
Forgive me for staring,

277
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,799
but you're the first
changeling I've ever met.

278
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,258
That you know of.

279
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,969
I sympathize
with your problem.

280
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,180
Uncovering changeling
infiltrators

281
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,807
is no easy task.

282
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:11,559
Well, with the help
of the two of you,

283
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,687
I trust it'll be
a little easier.

284
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,647
What exactly do you
want us to do?

285
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,898
We'd like to confer
with you and Odo.

286
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,233
See if there's anything
about the Founders

287
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,402
you left out
of your official reports.

288
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,196
I'll help in
any way I can,

289
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,865
but I think you'll find my
reports were quite thorough.

290
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,826
SISKO:
Admiral,

291
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,452
I doubt you brought us
all this way

292
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,078
just for a debriefing.

293
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,497
Of course not.

294
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:36,459
Ben, Earth is in danger--

295
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,795
maybe the greatest
danger it's faced

296
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,588
since the last World War.

297
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,591
Something has to be done
about these shape-shifters,

298
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,385
which is why
you're here.

299
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,636
You know more
about the Dominion

300
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,388
than anyone in Starfleet.

301
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:52,016
And so, effective immediately,
I'm making you acting head

302
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,643
of Starfleet Security
here on Earth.

303
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,936
Congratulations, Captain.

304
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,906
This is one beautiful fish.

305
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,576
Seems a shame
to eat a trout this pretty.

306
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,578
Why, you should thank me
for the privilege

307
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,496
of simply looking at it.

308
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,581
Well, go on, take a bite.

309
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,040
It won't bite you back.

310
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,417
Now, I don't want to see

311
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,837
anybody studying
the dessert menu.

312
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:24,006
If you order anything
but the bread pudding soufflé,

313
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,801
you'll be making a mistake
you will regret

314
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,095
the rest of your lives.

315
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,514
You should listen
to him.

316
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,558
The man knows
his bread pudding.

317
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:34,975
Benjamin!

318
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,561
(<i> both laugh</i> )

319
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,105
Dad.

320
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,147
Jake-o.

321
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,524
Hey.

322
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,568
When are you going
to stop growing?

323
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:46,112
If you keep this up,
you'll be bumping your head

324
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,614
on that alligator
before too long.

325
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:48,907
I remember when
you used to tell me

326
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,533
that alligator
was just in stasis

327
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,076
and you let it
out every night

328
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,411
to guard the restaurant.

329
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,329
Oh, I had to stop doing that.

330
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,248
It got to be too much trouble

331
00:15:57,248 --> 00:16:00,794
wrestling it back up
to the ceiling every morning.

332
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:03,588
Come on, I'll get Nathan
to bring you both

333
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,757
something to eat,
and we can catch up.

334
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:08,342
Nathan, some gumbo
for these fine, young men.

335
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,094
NATHAN:
Yes, sir.

336
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,472
So... where's
this shape-shifting fellow

337
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,307
you were coming with?

338
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:17,811
With things the way they are,
Odo thought it would be better

339
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,020
if he stayed
at Starfleet Headquarters.

340
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,564
I don't blame him.

341
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,983
I haven't seen people so nervous

342
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,485
since the Borg scare.

343
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,570
Me, personally,

344
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,030
I'd like to meet him.

345
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,074
Though I have to admit

346
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,536
I-I'm a little suspicious
about anyone who doesn't eat.

347
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,037
JAKE:
Grandpa.

348
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,790
Well, aren't you going
to eat anything?

349
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,083
I ate before you got here.

350
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,752
(<i> utensil clatters</i> )

351
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,880
Son, don't look at me that way.

352
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,507
You've lost weight.

353
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,967
You think so?

354
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,302
The doctors said you have
to keep your weight up.

355
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,679
Don't you start, too.

356
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,889
I have a vat of crayfish
in the back

357
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,266
that needs cleaning,
and it's got
your name on it.

358
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,979
Now, I'm going to say this
one time and one time only.

359
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:03,439
I am fine.

360
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:08,569
I'm happy, I'm healthy,
and I'm planning on celebrating

361
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,488
at least 50
more birthdays.

362
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,740
Satisfied?

363
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:22,876
Mmm. Gumbo is as good
as I remember.

364
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,172
Starfleet must be taking
the shape-shifters

365
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,590
pretty seriously

366
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,634
to have you come
all the way back here.

367
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,303
It is serious, Dad.

368
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:38,516
27 people murdered
right here on Earth.

369
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:42,020
Never thought I'd see the day.

370
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,147
But now that my son's
on the case,

371
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,774
I feel a lot better.

372
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:48,902
Jake!

373
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,110
Nog?

374
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,490
Captain Sisko.

375
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,742
What do you think?

376
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,326
You look good, Cadet.

377
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,703
You think so?

378
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,204
Nog, I thought
I was going to see you

379
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,288
tomorrow
at the Academy.

380
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,456
You are.

381
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,250
I'm just here
for dinner.

382
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,418
Nathan, the usual.

383
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,753
SISKO:
I didn't know

384
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,295
you liked Creole food.

385
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,923
I don't.
I like tube grubs.

386
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,008
And your father is
the only person on this planet

387
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,634
who can get me live ones.

388
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,054
I've been thinking
of adding them to our menu.

389
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,972
Of course, I'll have
to cook them

390
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,306
for our human customers,

391
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,225
serve them with
a nice remoulade.

392
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,644
Cook them?
What good are tube grubs

393
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,772
if they don't wiggle
on the way down?

394
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,441
So, how's everything
at the Academy?

395
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,901
Jake, they call it the Academy,

396
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,778
but what it really is,
is school.

397
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:32,946
Well, I want to hear about it.

398
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,447
It's a lot of work--

399
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,783
lots of classes,
lots of studying--

400
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:37,909
I'm doing okay.

401
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:40,286
Now, where are those tube grubs?

402
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,878
Good night.
You come back soon.

403
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,714
Come on, Ben.
I've got a nice
bottle of cognac

404
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,716
I've been saving
for a special occasion

405
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,301
and I think
this qualifies.

406
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,719
I think you're right.

407
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,554
Ah, there's nothing like
a full stomach

408
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,389
to make life
worth living.

409
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,767
So you going to tell me
what's on your mind or not?

410
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,393
What do you mean?

411
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,270
I mean, you didn't
stay here until closing

412
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,272
just to get
one more root beer.
Something's up.

413
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,649
My friend, the writer...

414
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,818
always looking for a good story.

415
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,820
If you don't want to tell me,
fine, don't tell me.

416
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,404
It's nothing.

417
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,156
It's stupid.

418
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,157
All right.

419
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,659
Forget about it.

420
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,452
It's just...

421
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,788
the Academy's different
than I thought it would be.

422
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,039
Different how?

423
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,624
Some of the cadets--

424
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,127
they're kind of standoffish,

425
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:30,586
especially the upperclassmen.

426
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,879
Because you're a Ferengi?

427
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,756
That's what I thought at first,

428
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,591
but then I heard
some of the other freshmen

429
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,426
complaining
about the same thing.

430
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,594
Complaining about what?

431
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,220
Little things.

432
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,016
For instance, there's this group
called Red Squad

433
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,642
made up of all the top students.

434
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:46,310
They're always
going off on trips,

435
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,561
getting special training.

436
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,438
None of them
will even talk to me.

437
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,357
You've only been in the Academy
for a month.

438
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,484
You can't expect
to fit in right away.

439
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:57,030
Who knows? One of these days,
you might even be in Red Squad.

440
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,823
I'm sure if you let them
get to know you,

441
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,658
show them you're
a really good guy to be around,

442
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:02,326
everything'll work out.

443
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,163
I am a good guy to be around,
aren't I?

444
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,873
I always thought so.

445
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,628
Mr. President, I'd like
to introduce Captain Sisko.

446
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:16,174
Captain, I've seen your record,
most exemplary.

447
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:17,591
Thank you, sir.

448
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,760
Captain Sisko has
several suggestions

449
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,846
on how to combat
Dominion infiltration.

450
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,140
I think you'll find them
very interesting.

451
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,725
Hmm...

452
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,602
I understand the need
for increased security, but...

453
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,813
blood screenings,
phaser sweeps?

454
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,273
They've proven very effective
on Deep Space 9.

455
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,234
I'm sure they have,

456
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,529
but I hope you'll keep in mind
that this is Earth,

457
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,823
and not
a military installation.

458
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:43,034
Which means it's a
lot more vulnerable.

459
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,785
We have to take
precautions.

460
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,662
Precautions may be advisable,

461
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,707
but I will not disrupt the lives
of the population,

462
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,751
despite what happened
at Antwerp.

463
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:55,337
I believe the changeling threat
to be somewhat less serious

464
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,463
than Starfleet does.

465
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:57,757
Mr. President,

466
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,718
I assure you,
the threat is real.

467
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:03,846
For all we know, there was
only one changeling on Earth,

468
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,806
and he may not
even be here anymore.

469
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,601
But if he is here,
we have a problem.

470
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,853
There's no telling
how much damage

471
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,230
one changeling can do.

472
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,233
Forgive me
for saying so, Captain,

473
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:17,151
but you sound
a little paranoid.

474
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,861
Do I?

475
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:25,409
Forgive the intrusion,
Mr. President,

476
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,869
but as you can see,

477
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,996
Starfleet has every right
to be concerned.

478
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,665
Allow me
to introduce Odo,

479
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,875
my Chief
of Security.

480
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:36,254
A very effective
entrance, Mr. Odo.

481
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:39,173
One that never should
have been allowed to take place.

482
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,884
Admiral Leyton and Captain Sisko
walked in here

483
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,886
without being searched,
without being blood-tested,

484
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,679
and without having
their possessions

485
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,932
subjected
to phaser sweeps.

486
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,600
SISKO:
If Odo was

487
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,727
a Dominion infiltrator,
he could've killed you.

488
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,937
Or replaced you.

489
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,480
The way security is now,

490
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,024
a changeling could
get anywhere on Earth,

491
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,776
replace anyone,
even you.

492
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,820
SISKO:
Mr. President,

493
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,572
all we want is your permission
to increase security

494
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,575
at Federation and Starfleet
installations here on Earth.

495
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,202
Blood tests will be limited

496
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:10,121
to high-ranking
Federation officials,

497
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,290
Starfleet officers
and their families.

498
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:15,084
The average citizen
won't even notice
the difference.

499
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:18,087
I wish these security measures
were not necessary,

500
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,798
but the safety of Earth
and the entire Federation

501
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:22,466
depends on them.

502
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,552
You present
a convincing argument, Captain.

503
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:29,431
It seems I have no choice
but to accept your proposals.

504
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,557
Thank you, sir.

505
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:31,976
Don't thank me.

506
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,061
If I could think
of another solution,

507
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,604
I would use it.

508
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,898
It took centuries
for Earth to evolve

509
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,567
into the peaceful haven
it is today.

510
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:45,531
I would hate to be remembered
as the Federation President

511
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,200
who destroyed paradise.

512
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,911
We're not looking to destroy
paradise, Mr. President.

513
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,039
We're looking to save it.

514
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:01,547
Activate the phaser.

515
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,514
That's enough.

516
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,269
How do you feel?

517
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:16,979
Well...

518
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,982
that time I definitely
experienced discomfort.

519
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,483
What was the setting?

520
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,776
Three point one.

521
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,279
If we set
the phasers at 3.4,

522
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:28,157
we should be able to stun
any changeling we hit

523
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:30,534
and force them back
into a gelatinous state.

524
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,785
I'd push it to 3.5

525
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,829
just to be on
the safe side.

526
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,123
But if you want to do
any more tests,

527
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,416
you'll have to get
another guinea pig.

528
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:41,461
I've been shot quite enough
for one day.

529
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,922
3.5 it is.

530
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,548
I want these units installed

531
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,218
in every room at Starfleet
and Federation Headquarters.

532
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:49,720
Then start working
on the orbital stations.

533
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,014
We'll have them in place
by tomorrow night.

534
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,557
I want to thank you, Captain.

535
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,975
Thank me? For what?

536
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,643
For convincing
the President

537
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,604
to implement
these security measures.

538
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:02,275
It feels like we're
finally on the right track.

539
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,985
Ha. You'd think she
would have thanked me as well.

540
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:08,406
I'm the one who got shot
13 times today.

541
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:10,116
Captain Sisko.

542
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,118
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

543
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,744
We were just
about finished.

544
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,704
Can I speak to you
for a minute?

545
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,706
In private?

546
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:22,044
Captain, I just want to say

547
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,338
I appreciate everything you've
done for me so far, and...

548
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:27,133
Jake says you're having
difficulty in school.

549
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,135
He told you that?!

550
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,011
He tells me everything.

551
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,888
I don't want you
to get the wrong idea!

552
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,890
Nog, you and I both knew

553
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,183
that it was going
to take a while

554
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:38,102
for you to adjust
to the Academy,

555
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:40,020
<i>and</i> for the Academy
to adjust to you.

556
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,772
I know, but it
turned out to be

557
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,857
even more difficult
than I expected.

558
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,610
You're just going to
have to stick with it.
And I intend to.

559
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,821
In fact, I think I've come up
with something

560
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,614
to help me make
some new friends.

561
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,698
Good.
But I need your help.

562
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,453
I want to join Red Squad.

563
00:24:57,455 --> 00:25:00,082
Red Squad?
What do you think?

564
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,084
I don't know what to think,
I've never heard of it.

565
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,544
It's an elite squad
of cadets at the Academy.

566
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,464
You know,
the best of the best.

567
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:08,882
They get special classes,
simulated missions,

568
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,177
off-campus training sessions,
all kinds of things.

569
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,553
A group of elite cadets?

570
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:16,349
They never had
anything like that

571
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,351
when I was at
the Academy.

572
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:19,977
Oh, it's pretty new.

573
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:23,022
It's a way of rewarding
excellence among the cadets.

574
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,982
I have the grades
to qualify,

575
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:28,068
but I need to be sponsored
by a high-ranking officer.

576
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,779
Ah, and you want me
to put your name in

577
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,781
for consideration?

578
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:36,618
All I'm asking for
is a chance to prove myself.

579
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,163
I... I'm kind of busy
right now, Nog.

580
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:46,045
But if I get the chance,
I'll see what I can do.

581
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,254
Thank you, sir!

582
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,006
This means a lot to me.

583
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,174
I can see that.

584
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,134
Dismissed, Cadet.

585
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:54,220
Yes, sir.

586
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,971
(<i> door opens</i> )

587
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,183
(<i> sighs</i> )

588
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,527
Well, look who's here.

589
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:11,611
Come in, stranger.

590
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,156
Sorry.

591
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:17,368
I haven't been around
much lately.

592
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:20,454
Oh, things have gotten
a little busy.

593
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,751
You want to tell me
about it?

594
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,627
I'm afraid I can't.

595
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:30,256
You'd think that Admiral
could spare you

596
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:33,426
for a few hours a day
to visit your father.

597
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:35,094
With you in San Francisco,

598
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:38,431
and Jake off visiting
that school in New Zealand,

599
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:41,225
it's like the two of you
aren't even here.

600
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:44,228
You know, Dad, you
could come and visit us

601
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:46,355
at the station
once in a while.

602
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:47,856
Don't start that again.

603
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,443
Earth's my home,
it's where I belong.

604
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:53,279
Besides, what would happen
to the restaurant

605
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,989
if I went gallivanting
around the galaxy?

606
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:59,034
You think Nathan can handle
this place on his own?

607
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:02,204
Nathan will be running
things around here
sooner than you think

608
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,582
if you don't take
better care of yourself.

609
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:06,584
I had a talk with your doctor,
and he tells me that you

610
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:08,710
haven't been in to see him
for eight months.

611
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,170
The man's an idiot.

612
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,423
He's lived in New Orleans
20 years

613
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:14,383
and can't tell the difference

614
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,634
between Creole food
and Cajun food.

615
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:18,887
Maybe not, but he can
tell the difference

616
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,514
between a healthy body

617
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:22,724
and one with progressive
atherosclerosis.

618
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,684
He says that if you
don't come in

619
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,686
for vascular
regeneration therapy

620
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:29,982
that this restaurant will
be looking for a new owner.

621
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:35,613
Ben, at my age, staying
healthy is a full-time job,

622
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:39,657
and I am too old
to work two jobs.

623
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:43,203
Now, how long
until you're due back

624
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,122
at Starfleet
Headquarters?

625
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:47,082
I've got about an hour.

626
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,460
Just enough time
to take a walk

627
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,378
to Audubon Park.

628
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,713
You up for a stroll
with your old man?

629
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:59,345
I can't think of anything
I'd rather do.

630
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:05,309
Nathan, don't forget
to stir the gumbo.

631
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,319
Odo.

632
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,781
That was really something.

633
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,201
I've never seen you
imitate a life-form before.

634
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:25,412
Well, I was just taking
a little aerial tour

635
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,913
of San Francisco.

636
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,374
It's quite nice.

637
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:30,042
Not as ancient
as the cities on Bajor,

638
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,835
but almost as impressive.

639
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,671
Makes me wonder
how many other changelings

640
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:35,464
might be flying around
up there.

641
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:38,967
If all they're doing is flying
around imitating sea gulls,

642
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,178
we don't have much
to worry about.

643
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:42,971
I doubt that
other changelings

644
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,432
are wasting their time
imitating birds.

645
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,767
They don't all share
Odo's lack of skill

646
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,853
when it comes to
mimicking humans.

647
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,897
That's right, they don't.

648
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,274
I'm glad
you're keeping that in mind.

649
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,901
Well, if you ask me,

650
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:58,529
that was a pretty
convincing sea gull.

651
00:28:58,529 --> 00:28:59,946
Thank you.

652
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:03,242
Though I'm not sure
the gulls would agree.

653
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:07,287
Commander, I think we've taken
up enough of Mr. Odo's time.

654
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:10,499
Keep practicing.
You'll have those birds
fooled in no time.

655
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:11,667
Admiral?
Yes.

656
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,252
I know that Starfleet Command

657
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,794
has always been
a little uneasy

658
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:17,297
about a changeling
working in their midst.

659
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,717
I just wanted to say
how much I appreciate

660
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:22,135
the trust you've
shown in me.

661
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,387
Thank you.

662
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:24,763
You're welcome.

663
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:32,730
Well done, Odo.

664
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,315
(<i> grunts</i> )

665
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,401
Are you all right?

666
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:38,818
I'm fine.

667
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,704
How did you know
he wasn't me?

668
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,706
Oh, I'm not sure exactly.

669
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:53,041
It's as if I could feel

670
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,419
the changeling's
hostility toward me.

671
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:56,836
You're the only changeling

672
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,880
who's ever harmed
one of his own people.

673
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,007
I'm sure that hasn't
made you many friends.

674
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:04,886
What I'd like to know is
why was he imitating me.

675
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,680
You have access to all
our security procedures,

676
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,973
all our protocols,
that makes you

677
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,182
a logical target.

678
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,726
I suppose so.

679
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,603
The bottom line is, a
changeling infiltrated

680
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:14,605
the grounds of
Starfleet Headquarters,

681
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:16,649
imitated the Admiral,
and got away scot-free.

682
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:18,609
Our security measures
aren't working.

683
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:21,111
We're doing everything
the president will let us do.

684
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,530
Maybe that's not enough.

685
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,365
We could talk
to the president again.

686
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:28,243
I'm afraid that would
be a waste of time.

687
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:31,037
Jaresh-Inyo would be
a fine President in peacetime,

688
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,956
but we have a war on our hands,

689
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,793
and he doesn't seem
to understand that.

690
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:39,630
All he cares about
is not upsetting people.

691
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:43,925
But humans are tougher
than he thinks.

692
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,885
We've created a paradise here,

693
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:48,388
and we're willing to fight
to protect it.

694
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:51,099
And you think the president
<i>isn't</i> willing to fight.

695
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:55,061
I think the president
is a long way from home.

696
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,855
This isn't his world.

697
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,024
We can't expect him to care
about it the way we do.

698
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,360
(<i> combadge chirps</i> )
Sisko here.

699
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,028
MAN:
Captain, your son's trying
to contact you.

700
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:05,823
He says it's urgent.
Put him through.

701
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:11,745
Dad, you'd better get down here
right away.

702
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:13,288
What's wrong?

703
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,791
It's Grandpa.
He's been arrested.

704
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,552
What's going on here?

705
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,679
Captain, we never meant for
things to get out of hand.

706
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:31,056
What did you think
would happen--

707
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,392
storming in here
and accusing me and my grandson

708
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,728
of being a couple
of shape-shifters?

709
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:39,105
We never accused you of being
a shape-shifter, Mr. Sisko.

710
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,441
We were just carrying out
our orders.

711
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,819
All family members
of Starfleet personnel

712
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:45,738
are required to submit
to blood screenings.

713
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:47,280
No exceptions.

714
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,700
That's the most ridiculous thing
I ever heard of.

715
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,243
Do you believe that?

716
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,537
I should. I signed
the orders myself.

717
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:57,290
Now why would you go and do
a stupid thing like that?

718
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,084
Dad, it has to be done.

719
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,293
Grandpa, look.

720
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,670
I'll take the test first.

721
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,296
Go ahead.

722
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,430
Now me.

723
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,014
Sir, that's not necessary.

724
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,474
Do it anyway.

725
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,783
It's your turn.

726
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:34,327
Jake, do you think
I'm a shape-shifter?

727
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,871
Come on, Grandpa.

728
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,873
Answer the question.

729
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:40,751
No, I don't think
you're a shape-shifter.

730
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:43,295
At least somebody in my family
has some sense.

731
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,881
Dad!
I don't want
to hear about it.

732
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:47,549
You take these two
vampires and tell them

733
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,301
to either sit down
and grab a menu

734
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,052
or get out of
my restaurant.

735
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,805
Jake, get them a menu.

736
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:54,514
But, sir...

737
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,975
I would recommend
the shrimp creole.

738
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,268
Look, Dad...

739
00:32:58,268 --> 00:32:59,603
I don't want to hear it.

740
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:01,104
Listen to me...

741
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,231
you have got to
take the test.

742
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,691
Why should I?

743
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,819
If I was an enemy spy,

744
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:09,446
looking to replace someone,
I think I could

745
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:12,198
come up with better choices
than an old chef.

746
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:16,995
Yeah, you're probably right,
but this isn't about you.

747
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,998
We've got civilian families
living on starships

748
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,918
and Starfleet installations
all over the Federation.

749
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:25,629
The only way we can
secure those facilities

750
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:27,631
is to test everyone there

751
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,716
whether they wear
a uniform or not.

752
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,719
I'm not living
on a Starfleet installation.

753
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,180
Dad, if we test
the family members

754
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,934
of one Starfleet officer,
we must test them all.

755
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:40,853
You may want
to test everyone,

756
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:43,229
but that doesn't mean
we all have to cooperate.

757
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,732
I didn't take
an oath to Starfleet.

758
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:49,361
Neither did Jake or your sister
or anyone in your family.

759
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:52,155
We have rights, Ben,
including the right

760
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:55,492
to be as stubborn
or thickheaded as we want.

761
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:57,202
Damn it, Dad!

762
00:33:57,202 --> 00:34:01,080
Can't you cooperate
just<i> one</i> time?

763
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,624
You don't take
your medication.

764
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,751
You don't go
to the doctor.

765
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,212
You won't let Judith help
you in the restaurant.

766
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:10,799
Just one time, please
do what you're asked.

767
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:13,301
I wish I could,

768
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:16,513
but what you're
asking me to do is wrong.

769
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:20,392
You can't go around
making people prove they are

770
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,810
who they say they are.

771
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,186
That's no way to live,

772
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,230
and I'm not going
to go along with it.

773
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,567
Now, if you want
to make yourself useful,

774
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:31,110
start some water boiling
for the shrimp.

775
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,154
Come on, Dad.

776
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,073
Don't be this way.

777
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,035
If I have to,
I will get a warrant...

778
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:40,119
And what?

779
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:43,331
Hold me down and force me
to give you my blood?

780
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,208
Because that's the only way
you'll get...

781
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,210
Damn it!

782
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,337
Now look what I've done.

783
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,851
Jake?

784
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:05,687
Yeah?

785
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:08,982
I've got a dermal regenerator
under the...

786
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:11,902
Benjamin Lafayette Sisko.

787
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:14,613
What the hell
has gotten into your head?

788
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:17,532
You actually thought
I was one of them, didn't you?

789
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,911
I don't know.
I wasn't sure.

790
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:23,997
This business has got you
so twisted around,

791
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:26,083
you, you can't think straight.

792
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:28,877
You're seeing shape-shifters
everywhere.

793
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:32,672
Maybe you ought to think
about something for a minute.

794
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,967
If I was
a smart shape-shifter--

795
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:37,928
a really good one--
the first thing I would do

796
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:41,098
would be to grab
some poor soul off the street,

797
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:44,851
absorb every ounce of his blood
and let it out on cue,

798
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,562
whenever someone like you
tried to test me.

799
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,188
Don't you see?

800
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:52,067
There isn't a test
that's been created

801
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,778
a smart man
can't find his way around.

802
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:57,322
You aren't going
to catch shape-shifters

803
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,116
using some gadget.

804
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:02,535
The only thing
you can count on in this life...

805
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,245
(<i> gasping</i> )

806
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,330
Grandpa!

807
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,999
(<i> groaning</i> )

808
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:14,965
The EMTs said he'd be okay
and they were right.

809
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:16,591
It turns out
it was just a mild stroke,

810
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,844
brought on
by his atherosclerosis.

811
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:21,346
How's Jake handling it?

812
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,389
He is very upset.

813
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,142
He knows as well as I do

814
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:27,894
that if my father doesn't
take better care of himself...

815
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,729
(<i> chuckling</i> )

816
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,231
I've found that when it comes
to doing what's best for you,

817
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:34,526
you humanoids
have the distressing habit

818
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,444
of doing the exact opposite.

819
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,780
I can't argue with that.

820
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,200
But what bothers me is

821
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,954
that for a few moments there,
I really believed

822
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,706
that my own father
was a changeling.

823
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:51,793
A reasonable assumption
considering the circumstances.

824
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:56,840
(<i> sighs</i> ):
I don't care
if it's reasonable or not...

825
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,718
but when a son
can't trust his own father...

826
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,845
That's why my people
came here--

827
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:05,640
to undermine the trust
and mutual understanding

828
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,225
the Federation is built on.

829
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,394
But what if my father's right?

830
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,688
What if all our precautions
turn out to be useless?

831
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:15,108
Maybe they will, but that
doesn't mean you should give up.

832
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:16,902
My people are here,

833
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:20,113
and you've got to fight them
with whatever you've got.

834
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:26,119
I hope you don't take this
the wrong way, Constable,

835
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:31,416
but there are times I wish
you'd never found your people.

836
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,796
Believe me, Captain...

837
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:40,050
sometimes I feel the same way.

838
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:46,305
Grandpa, would you
please sit down?

839
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,599
Enjoy your meal.

840
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,602
Your food will
be right out.

841
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,901
What's that look
supposed to mean?

842
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,694
You sat down.

843
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,072
Damn right I sat down.

844
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:03,990
I feel terrible.

845
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,533
You should be in bed.

846
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,578
Jake, the only time
you should be in bed

847
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:11,081
is if you're sleeping, dying,

848
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:13,625
or making love
to a beautiful woman.

849
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:18,046
I'm not tired, I'm not dying,

850
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:22,050
and the truth is,
I'm too old for beautiful women,

851
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,594
so I might as well be here.

852
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:27,597
Your father's the one
you should be worried about.

853
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:29,390
Dad? Why?

854
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,268
I've never seen him so tense.

855
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:32,852
It's like he's carrying

856
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,230
the weight of the world
on his shoulders.

857
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,940
He is.

858
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:41,111
I suppose he is, at that.

859
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:43,863
(<i> patrons gasp</i> )
What happened?

860
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,531
I don't know.

861
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,533
The whole block's dark.

862
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,036
Are you all right?

863
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,246
I'm fine.

864
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:52,747
Admiral, what's going on?

865
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,749
From what we can tell, Earth's

866
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,584
entire power relay system's
been knocked off line.

867
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,754
Even Starfleet's emergency
backup's been affected.

868
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,756
How could that happen?
I don't know

869
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,675
but if you ask me, there's only
one possible explanation...

870
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:04,801
Sabotage.

871
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,261
The changelings.

872
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,720
Take out the
power relays,

873
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,597
and you neutralize
sensors, transporters,

874
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,683
surface-based defense
installations...

875
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:15,061
In other words,
Earth is defenseless.

876
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:18,731
If the Dominion attacks now,
we don't stand a chance.

877
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,614
I'm not interested
in excuses.

878
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,116
It is imperative

879
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,869
we get the power relay system
functioning again.

880
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:36,082
Mr. President.

881
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,834
How did you people get here?

882
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:41,420
We contacted the<i> Lakota</i>
and used their transporters.

883
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,507
Mr. President,
as acting head of Earth Security

884
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:47,886
I must advise you
to declare a state of emergency.

885
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,429
You're serious.

886
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,224
With the exception
of the Borg incident,

887
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:54,184
there hasn't been
a state of emergency

888
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:55,601
declared on Earth in a century.

889
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,520
I am aware of that,

890
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,690
but I have reason to believe
that a Dominion war fleet

891
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,068
may be in the Alpha Quadrant
headed for Earth.

892
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,195
Do you have evidence
to back this up?

893
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:07,322
Just before we left
Deep Space 9,

894
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:10,242
the wormhole was exhibiting
some unusual behavior--

895
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:12,660
opening and closing
for no apparent reason.

896
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,288
We didn't detect any ships
coming through at the time,

897
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:17,165
but the Dominion
might have been using

898
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,209
some kind
of cloaking technology.

899
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:22,254
I wasn't aware the Dominion
had cloaking technology.

900
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:24,547
The combined Cardassian
and Romulan fleet

901
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:27,466
that the Dominion destroyed
in the Gamma Quadrant

902
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,802
was equipped
with cloaking devices.

903
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:33,390
Who knows what my people might
have taken from the wreckage.

904
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,725
How long
till the power relays are fixed?

905
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,394
From what we can tell,
the changelings

906
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:39,104
infected the system
with some kind

907
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:40,897
of self-replicating
computer protocol.

908
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,649
It jumped from one
power relay to the next,

909
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,777
disrupting every system
it came in contact with.

910
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,737
The only way
to correct the problem

911
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:51,032
is to shut down the entire grid,
purge all the operating systems,

912
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:52,909
and restart
the relays.

913
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:54,411
And that could take days.

914
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:56,413
Which is why
it is imperative

915
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:59,124
that you declare
a state of emergency.

916
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:00,458
What good will that do

917
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,877
when we have no way
to defend ourselves?

918
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,837
Mr. President, we can use

919
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,506
the<i> Lakota's</i> transporters
and communications system

920
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,342
to mobilize
every Starfleet officer on Earth

921
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:11,303
in less than 12 hours.

922
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:13,888
We've been preparing
for something like this
for a long time.

923
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,182
We have stockpiles
of phaser rifles,

924
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,393
personal force fields,
photon grenades--

925
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:19,936
enough to equip an entire army.

926
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:22,814
I can start getting men
on the streets immediately.

927
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,858
What you're asking me to do
is declare martial law.

928
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:29,487
What I'm asking you to do is
let us defend this planet.

929
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,365
We don't know what
the changelings will do next,

930
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:34,826
but we have to be
ready for them.

931
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,661
Ben, tell him.

932
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:42,125
Sir, the thought of filling
the streets with armed troops

933
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:45,670
is as disturbing to
me as it is to you,

934
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,297
but not as disturbing

935
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:49,548
as the thought of
a Jem'Hadar army

936
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,634
landing on Earth
without opposition.

937
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,761
The Jem'Hadar are
the most brutal

938
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,639
and efficient soldiers
I've ever encountered.

939
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,600
They don't care about
the conventions of war

940
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,269
or protecting civilians.

941
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,229
They will not
limit themselves

942
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,689
to military targets.

943
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:06,983
They'll be waging
the kind of war

944
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:08,485
Earth hasn't seen

945
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:10,569
since the founding
of the Federation.

946
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,822
At the same time,
my people will continue

947
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:15,574
to undermine Earth's defenses
in any way they can.

948
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:17,869
This power outage
is only the beginning.

949
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:21,747
I never sought this job.

950
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:25,126
I was content
to simply represent my people

951
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:27,753
on the Federation Council.

952
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:30,507
When they asked me
to submit my name for election,

953
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:32,591
I almost said no.

954
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:35,053
Today, I wish I had.

955
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:37,555
We appreciate your feelings,
Mr. President,

956
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,807
but we don't have time
for regrets.

957
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,851
You accepted the job
and now it's yours.

958
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:43,728
ODO:
Mr. President

959
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:46,189
there are people
all over this planet right now

960
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:49,442
huddled in the dark, terrified
about what might happen next.

961
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:52,070
They're waiting for a sign,
something to reassure them

962
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,571
that everything
will be all right,

963
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,032
<i>but</i> they won't wait long.

964
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:58,117
Fear is a powerful
and dangerous thing,

965
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,286
and if you don't act,

966
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,372
if you don't show them
that they're not alone,

967
00:43:02,372 --> 00:43:05,875
then fear will surely take over.

968
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,545
Give us the authority
we need, Mr. President

969
00:43:08,545 --> 00:43:11,464
and we will take
care of the rest.

970
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:26,563
JARESH-INYO:
Earth is in your hands,
gentlemen.

971
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:28,565
Do what needs to be done.

972
00:43:28,565 --> 00:43:30,316
Thank you, sir.

973
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:32,651
You've made the
right decision.

974
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:35,572
I hope you're right...

975
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:38,283
for all our sakes.

976
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,455
(<i> voices approaching</i> )

977
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,918
Grandpa?

978
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:50,711
Grandpa, wake up!

979
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,880
I'm not sleeping.

980
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,715
I'm checking
my eyelids for holes.

981
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,342
You'd better come
take a look at this.

982
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:57,635
Take a look at what?

983
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,719
Come on.
