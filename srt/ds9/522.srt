00:00:01,836 --> 00:00:05,714
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 50814.2.</i>

2
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:07,925
<i>The</i> Defiant<i> is returning</i>
<i>to Deep Space 9</i>

3
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:10,469
<i>after a week-long</i>
<i>reconnaissance mission</i>

4
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,137
<i>in the Gamma Quadrant.</i>

5
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:15,474
I can't wait to get home
and sleep in my own bed.

6
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:18,393
The bunks on this ship
are so uncomfortable.

7
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:19,812
You know
what I could use?

8
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:21,939
A weekend
at the Golian spa.

9
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:24,859
Mmm... maybe
you and Shakaar

10
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:26,401
can slip away when we get back.

11
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,946
We're not seeing
each other anymore.

12
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,531
When did this happen?

13
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,366
Last week.

14
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:35,202
No wonder you've
been so down lately.

15
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,204
I miss him.

16
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,122
But the last time
we were on Bajor,

17
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,333
we went to the Kenda shrine
and we asked the Prophets

18
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,460
if we were meant
to walk the same path.

19
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,045
And?
We're not.

20
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:48,215
DAX:
You make it sound
so cut-and-dry.

21
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,800
Well, the way I see it,

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,886
people are either
meant to be together

23
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,178
or they're not.

24
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,722
I guess I'd rather believe

25
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,098
that any relationship
can work

26
00:00:57,098 --> 00:01:00,227
as long as both people
really want it to.

27
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:06,233
I'm not sure I have an opinion
on the subject.

28
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,194
Excuse me.
I need to regenerate.

29
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,950
Is he all right?
You know Odo.

30
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,745
This sort of talk
makes him uncomfortable.

31
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:36,805
No, thanks.
I'm trying
to cut down.

32
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,391
O'BRIEN: I'm making
Molly a dollhouse
for her birthday.

33
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,309
Oh. Thank you.

34
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,979
The house itself was easy,
but the furniture--

35
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,189
even with a microlathe,
I'm not sure I'm going

36
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,191
to get it all
finished in time.

37
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,569
I guess her dolls are going
to have to rough it for a while.

38
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,029
Interesting.

39
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,655
I'm getting
some unusual readings

40
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,156
from a nearby solar system.

41
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,700
What kind of readings?

42
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,827
There's some sort
of energy barrier

43
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,495
surrounding the
fourth planet.

44
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,289
It's hard to tell
from the interference,

45
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,291
but there could be life-forms
on the surface.

46
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,794
If there are, I'd be interested
to see how they've adapted

47
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:09,004
to the quantum fluctuations
in the barrier.

48
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,547
O'BRIEN:
Can't we check it out

49
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,132
the next time
we come this way?

50
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,926
It'll be too late.

51
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:16,428
At the rate the interference
is intensifying,

52
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:19,222
in a few weeks,
we won't even be able to
send a probe through it.

53
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,432
Dax...

54
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:24,019
I know everyone wants
to go home,

55
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,771
but if we're going to take
a look at this planet,

56
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,272
it'll be our only chance.

57
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,732
Are you sure it's safe

58
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,484
to pass through
the interference?

59
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:36,782
A few shield modifications,
and it should be smooth sailing.

60
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,871
All right,
we'll make a quick survey,

61
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,624
but if all we detect
is some fungus,

62
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:46,959
we're not beaming down.

63
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,920
What if it's smart fungus?

64
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:00,347
We're approaching the barrier.

65
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,724
All right, old man,
take us in.

66
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,559
(<i> alarm beeping</i> )

67
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:08,229
Adjusting shield harmonics
to compensate.

68
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,609
Quantum fluctuations
are intensifying.

69
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,781
(<i> gasping</i> )

70
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,036
We're through.

71
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,752
Are you all right?
I think so.

72
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,547
Dr. Bashir to the Bridge.
No, I'm fine.

73
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,465
The inertial dampers
are off-line

74
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,677
and the gyromagnetic
stabilizers are depolarized.

75
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,931
We're going to be here
for a few days.

76
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,934
Smooth sailing.

77
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,020
WORF:
Sir, we are being hailed
from the surface.

78
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,897
There are several
scattered settlements

79
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,690
across the southern peninsula.

80
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,818
I am reading approximately...
8,000 inhabitants.

81
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,361
They appear to be human.

82
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,697
On screen.

83
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:02,283
Welcome to Gaia,
Captain Sisko.

84
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,703
You know my name?
We've been expecting you.

85
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,497
It's a long story,
Benjamin. Why don't
you come down

86
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,499
and we'll talk about it
over some<i> raktajino?</i>

87
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,501
Oh, I forgot.

88
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,378
You're trying
to cut down.

89
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,390
(<i> whoosh of</i>
<i>active transport)</i>

90
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,445
Miranda O'Brien.

91
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,447
Yedrin...

92
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,365
Yedrin Dax.

93
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,368
What a coincidence.

94
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,746
Would one of you
mind telling us
what's going on?

95
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:50,457
MIRANDA:
This settlement was
founded by the crew

96
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,459
of a Starfleet
vessel that crashed
on this planet

97
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,419
two centuries ago.

98
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,380
I realize this is
going to be hard
for you to accept,

99
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,841
but that ship
was the<i> Defiant.</i>

100
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,552
Two days from now,
when you leave here

101
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,139
and try to pass through
the energy barrier,

102
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:08,892
you will be thrown
back in time 200 years.

103
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,852
You'll be stranded here

104
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,855
and become the founders
of this settlement.

105
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:17,943
We... are your descendants.

106
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,690
YEDRIN:
Go ahead,
Jadzia, scan me.

107
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,235
You'll find the Dax
symbiont right here.

108
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,281
It's true.

109
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,199
YEDRIN:
The symbiont
has been passed down

110
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,785
to Jadzia's descendants
for three generations.

111
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:35,747
I remember all of you
like it was yesterday.

112
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,999
If you scan Miranda,
you'll find that her DNA

113
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,501
is substantially similar
to that of the Chief's.

114
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,509
She's an O'Brien,
all right.

115
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,886
And a Tannenbaum, too.

116
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,347
You mean
Ensign Tannenbaum?

117
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,932
From Engineering?

118
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,811
You and Rita were married

119
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,981
ten years after
the<i> Defiant</i> crashed.

120
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,691
You were trapped here, Miles,
200 years in the past.

121
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,027
There was no going home.
There was no chance

122
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,904
of ever seeing
your family again.

123
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,489
You were the last
to give up hope

124
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,116
but, eventually,
you had to make

125
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,784
a new life
for yourself here.

126
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,621
Mm-hmm.

127
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,706
I know that face, Benjamin.

128
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,251
You're still not convinced
that we're telling
you the truth.

129
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,044
All right,
if you want,

130
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,754
I could tell
you something

131
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,756
that only Curzon
would know.

132
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,592
Do you remember
that dancer

133
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,261
that you met on
Pelios Station?

134
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,805
The one that...?
That... that'll do.

135
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,265
Thank you.

136
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,227
Are you the son of Mogh?

137
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,398
Yes, I am.

138
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,733
Is it true you
can kill someone

139
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,527
just by looking at them?

140
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,073
Only when I am angry.

141
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,658
(<i> crowd chuckles</i> )

142
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,535
MIRANDA:
Why don't we go inside?

143
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,204
You can meet
some of the others later.

144
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,622
We still have
a lot to talk about.

145
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,005
Ready for the next problem?

146
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,051
Say you have
27 tessipates of land

147
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:14,804
you want to plant with nice,
juicy yelg melons.

148
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,973
This is our meeting hall
which, as you can see,

149
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,850
we sometimes use
as a schoolroom.

150
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,228
...needs one square kerripate
of land to grow in

151
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,356
what is the total number
of melons you can plant?

152
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:27,775
Let me know as soon
as you have an answer.

153
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,653
Jadzia designed it as
an educational program.

154
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,698
She took Quark's image
from the security logs
of the<i> Defiant.</i>

155
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,743
I've always thought
that Quark would make
a great math teacher.

156
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,496
He's so good
with numbers.

157
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,039
I like your spots.

158
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,749
Most people
don't have them

159
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,168
because our ancestors
were mostly human.

160
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,254
My mom says they
make me special.

161
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:52,342
It's just genetics, Lisa,
like... Torvin's ridges.

162
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,594
You're just
jealous, Molly.

163
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,180
Molly?

164
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,099
Oh, yes, you'll find
a lot of them here.

165
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,435
The name has been
passed down through
the O'Brien line.

166
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,686
Molly, this is
your grandfather's

167
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,855
great-great-great-grandfather.

168
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,941
Hello.

169
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,817
Hi.

170
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,696
How much were we...
were<i> you</i>

171
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,032
able to salvage
from the<i> Defiant?</i>

172
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,701
A portable generator,
a replicator

173
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,580
a few phasers, tricorders,
things of that sort.

174
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,332
Did anybody ever try
to send out a distress signal?

175
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,209
To who? It was
200 years ago.

176
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,169
The wormhole hadn't even
been discovered yet.

177
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,004
There was no way back
to the Alpha Quadrant.

178
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,840
Our ancestors decided to
make this their new home.

179
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,094
And they needed
a shelter quickly
before winter came.

180
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:39,180
This is it.
This is the oldest
building there is.

181
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,849
At first, everyone
had to sleep here--

182
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,435
all 48 of them.

183
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,645
Forty-eight?

184
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,730
Ah...

185
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,441
Kira died

186
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,234
a few weeks
after the crash.

187
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,445
The energy discharge
that struck her on the Bridge

188
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:56,030
damaged her
neural pathways.

189
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,865
The<i> Defiant</i> didn't have
the medical equipment

190
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,367
that Julian needed
to treat her.

191
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,244
You want to see
where she was buried?

192
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,955
Maybe later.

193
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,500
Girls, why don't you run along
and help your parents?

194
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,544
It's almost time
for planting, and there's
a lot of work to be done.

195
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:10,837
Bye.

196
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,088
Bye.

197
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,637
Obviously, we need to get Kira

198
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,555
back to the station
for treatment

199
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:24,100
as soon as we can
repair the<i> Defiant.</i>
<i>Of course.</i>

200
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,645
I don't quite know
how to say this,

201
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:29,730
but now that we know
about the accident

202
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:34,110
that sent the ship back in time,
we should be able to avoid it.

203
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,945
WORF:
Well, if we do that

204
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,614
your timeline will collapse

205
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,200
and everything here
will cease to exist.

206
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,285
Not necessarily.

207
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:46,164
I have a plan.

208
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:49,959
And the key is what happened
to Kira on the Bridge.

209
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:54,172
This energy discharge
caused a subspace
doubling effect.

210
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,591
For an instant,
every molecule in her body

211
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,885
had a corresponding
quantum duplicate.

212
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,054
There were literally
two Kiras.

213
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,514
Go on.

214
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,391
If we make
certain modifications

215
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,184
to the<i> Defiant's</i> systems,

216
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,978
we should be able to amplify
this doubling effect

217
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:12,773
and create a quantum duplicate
of the entire ship.

218
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:15,318
When you encounter
the temporal anomaly

219
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:19,239
the duplicate will be
thrown back into the past,
and the original--

220
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,158
you-- will pass through
the barrier unaffected.

221
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,953
O'BRIEN:
So you're saying
we go home,

222
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,039
and your timeline
is preserved.

223
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,083
Exactly.

224
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,460
What do you think?

225
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,128
It might work.

226
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,714
YEDRIN:
Now, according
to the logs

227
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,632
I retrieved
from the wreckage,

228
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:40,468
the<i> Defiant</i> encountered
the anomaly 39 hours

229
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,429
after it
arrived in orbit.

230
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,265
If your plan is to work,
we<i> must</i> do the same.

231
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:49,102
There are almost 8,000 people
living on this planet.

232
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,272
This is
the only chance they have.

233
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:57,485
Dax, I want a
full evaluation

234
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,153
as soon as possible.

235
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,780
<i>If</i> the plan is sound,
start making

236
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,033
the modifications
immediately.

237
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,455
Thank you, Benjamin.

238
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,123
Anything for you...

239
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,709
old man.

240
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,844
Apparently, the planet
is crawling with Bashirs.

241
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,306
Maybe I'll stay up here.
(<i> laughs</i> )

242
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,475
How's Odo?
He's resting comfortably.

243
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,268
He can't hold his shape

244
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,895
because of the quantum
fluctuations inside the barrier.

245
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,855
Sweet dreams, Odo.

246
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,109
But he'll be
as right as rain

247
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,153
as soon as we leave orbit.

248
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,072
<i>You,</i> on the other hand...

249
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,910
are going to have
to undergo a complete
neural pathway induction

250
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,746
as soon as we get back
to the station.

251
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,665
If you say so.
I feel fine.

252
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,166
That's because
your neural tissue

253
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,084
hasn't begun
to deteriorate yet,

254
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,003
but rest assured,

255
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:00,881
you'll be on my operating
table eventually.

256
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,551
Hey...
where you off to?

257
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:08,139
I have to get down there,
meet some of those Bashirs.

258
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,987
Hello, Nerys.

259
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,324
Odo?

260
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,784
I came up from the surface

261
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,869
as soon as I heard
you were here.

262
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,330
How... how are you
holding your shape?

263
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,998
I... I thought...

264
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,667
I learned to counter
the barrier's effects

265
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,084
a long time ago.

266
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,840
It's good to see you.

267
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,426
You look different.

268
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,345
I've gotten better
at shape-shifting

269
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:48,971
over the years.

270
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:55,395
You're as beautiful
as I remember.

271
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,690
You can't know how I've longed

272
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,233
to hear your voice,

273
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,194
see your smile.

274
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:07,114
Odo... what's
gotten into you?

275
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,991
There's something
I want you to know,

276
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,328
something I've wanted
to tell you for 200 years.

277
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,248
I love you, Nerys.

278
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,000
I've always loved you.

279
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:32,432
What do you mean,
you love me?

280
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,560
Is it so hard to believe?

281
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,274
I never knew
you felt that way about me.

282
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,192
I did everything I could

283
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,779
to make sure you
wouldn't find out.

284
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,407
Uh...

285
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:50,784
it worked.

286
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,537
Why didn't you
ever say anything?

287
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,917
I didn't think you
could possibly care for me

288
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,835
the way I care for you.

289
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:03,963
I suppose I was afraid
of ruining what we had.

290
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,133
Our friendship meant
everything to me.
It still does.

291
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,137
Maybe I shouldn't
have said anything.

292
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,597
It's not that.

293
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,183
I was just thinking
about all the times

294
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:20,313
I came to you for advice
about Shakaar and Bareil.

295
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,940
It must have been
very hard for you

296
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,567
to listen to me go on
about another man.

297
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,569
No, I can't say I enjoyed it.

298
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,656
But I wanted to be
a good friend to you.

299
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,283
You were.

300
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:36,245
Nerys, I didn't come
here expecting you

301
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,790
to throw yourself
into my arms.

302
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,541
But you're leaving
here in two days.

303
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,503
I'm never going
to see you again.

304
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,087
All I'm asking

305
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,548
is that you spend
some time with me.

306
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,634
Gaia is a very
beautiful place.

307
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,594
I'd love to show it to you.

308
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,644
I'd like that.

309
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,230
He has your eyes.

310
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,399
Do you think so?
You think so?

311
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,443
Dax to Sisko.
Go ahead.

312
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,111
Good news, Benjamin.

313
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,822
I've gone over the sensor
logs from the crash.

314
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,782
It looks like Yedrin's plan

315
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,201
to create a duplicate
<i>Defiant </i> is going to work.

316
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,870
Di-di-did you hear that?

317
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,122
Yes, everything's going
to be all right.

318
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,082
Yes, yes...
(<i> baby cooing</i> )

319
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,043
Sounds like you have your hands
full down there, Benjamin.

320
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,837
Yes, you could say that.

321
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:27,672
DAX:
We'll keep you posted.

322
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,849
Thirsty?

323
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,893
The Captain asked me
to make a survey

324
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,602
of the settlement's
infrastructure

325
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,521
so we can leave behind
the appropriate supplies.

326
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,314
I've just been doing the
same thing at the clinic.

327
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,274
I met one of my
descendants there--

328
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:51,404
my great-great-great-
great-granddaughter.

329
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:54,991
The doctor. She made
quite a fuss over me.

330
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:58,036
Apparently, my healing
touch is something of
a legend around here.

331
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:00,580
They're here!
They're here!

332
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,081
Who?

333
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,917
The Klingons.

334
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,505
<i>Qapla'.</i>

335
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,050
<i>Qapla'.</i>

336
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,052
We are the Sons of Mogh.

337
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,221
You are my descendants.

338
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,557
Some by blood,
some by choice.

339
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,518
Our hearts are Klingon.
We live as warriors,

340
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,063
just as you taught
our ancestors long ago.

341
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,565
I'm going to be
one of them someday.

342
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,234
I'll ride a wild torga
and go hunting

343
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,736
and only come to the settlement

344
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,487
to trade furs
for the things I need.

345
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,782
When you're older,
you'll have the chance 

346
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,784
to prove yourself.
If you are worthy,

347
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,703
you can take a Klingon name
and live among us.

348
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:44,749
The Sons of Mogh are gathering
to celebrate your return.

349
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,001
It would honor us greatly
if you would feast

350
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,377
with us tonight.

351
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,171
I look forward to it.

352
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,799
We'll come for you at nightfall.

353
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,012
Well, it would appear

354
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,890
that I'm not the only
legend around here.

355
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,106
Once the emitter array
is recalibrated,

356
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,691
we can start synchronizing
the shield generators.

357
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,860
Oh, good.
We're ahead of schedule.

358
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,073
(<i> chuckling</i> )
What?

359
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,616
Tell me.

360
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:21,661
You just reminded me
of something.

361
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,329
The summer after the crash,

362
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,790
it was so hot,
Jadzia cut her hair short.

363
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,458
Worf hated it.

364
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,170
I remember promising
to grow it back

365
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,546
in time for the wedding.

366
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,799
We got married?

367
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,509
Mm-hmm.

368
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,385
The next fall.

369
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,471
Benjamin performed the ceremony.

370
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:44,183
I'll never forget Worf's voice
as he said his vows.

371
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,560
It was shaking.

372
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,812
(<i> laughs</i> )

373
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,982
Were we happy together?

374
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:52,859
Mm-hmm.

375
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,234
He's a good man, Jadzia.

376
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,613
I know.

377
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,533
It's just, sometimes...

378
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,202
he's so hard
to get along with.

379
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,164
Don't worry.
You'll learn to handle him.

380
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,293
BASHIR:
Did I mention
she was a doctor?

381
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,171
Twice.

382
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,173
Well, she showed me
pictures of the family

383
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:17,050
going all the way
back to me.

384
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,259
You know who I ended up with
after the crash?

385
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,970
Angie Kirby.

386
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,140
Who's that?
Yeah, that's what I said.

387
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,934
Apparently, she transferred
aboard last week.
But she's gorgeous.

388
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,728
Congratulations.
You know what?

389
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,479
I think I'm going to ask her out
when we get back.

390
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,024
We obviously
got along well here.

391
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:37,028
So, you and, uh...

392
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:38,821
Rita Tannenbaum.

393
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,656
I don't want to hear
about it, Julian.

394
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,742
I have a wife
and kids back home.

395
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,660
Sorry. I didn't
mean anything.

396
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,038
You know, I'm going to let you
get back on with your work.

397
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,505
(<i> giggling</i> )

398
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,892
(<i> sighs</i> )

399
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,029
Praying over your own grave.

400
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,198
That's got to be a new one.

401
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,200
Yeah.

402
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,369
If the Prophets were listening,
they're probably very confused.

403
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:30,206
Well, I wouldn't blame them.

404
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,959
I've got to tell you, that...

405
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:36,378
this whole quantum duplicate,
two<i> Defiants</i> thing

406
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,297
has me feeling a little strange.

407
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,508
Why? Thanks
to Yedrin's plan,

408
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,343
our timeline
is being preserved.

409
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,054
You're going back
to the station

410
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,430
for the treatment you need.

411
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,307
I know. It...

412
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,811
it's just that I've
always believed

413
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:55,606
that we're all given
one destiny-- one path--

414
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:59,277
and now we're using technology
to get around that.

415
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,905
I'm not sure
how it makes me feel.

416
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:05,283
I know exactly
how it makes<i> me</i> feel.

417
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,494
You can't know
how much it means to me

418
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,412
to know you're
going home, Nerys.

419
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,915
No, it won't change
anything for me.

420
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:17,586
I lost you 200 years ago.

421
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,798
But for the other Odo,
up on the ship,

422
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,884
it changes everything.

423
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,679
He doesn't have to lose you.

424
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,973
And somehow...

425
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:31,058
knowing that...

426
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,351
makes me feel better.

427
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,939
Does that make any sense?

428
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,817
You've changed so much, Odo.

429
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,696
I don't just mean
the way you look.

430
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:48,826
You used to be so closed off.

431
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:51,329
I<i> have</i> changed.

432
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:56,374
And the Odo you know
will change, too.

433
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:01,339
<i>If</i> you're patient with him.

434
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:06,052
Why don't we head back?

435
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,845
Ah.

436
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,829
Nice catch.

437
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,374
Dax.

438
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:38,000
We need to talk.

439
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,335
Uh-huh.

440
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:40,961
I was going over
the sensor logs

441
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,671
from the crash,

442
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,049
and I came across
something odd.

443
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:57,477
The quantum fluctuations
in the barrier
factored out to zero.

444
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:01,190
The chances of that
must be a billion to one.

445
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,691
What are you
getting at?

446
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,568
That Yedrin
faked the logs.

447
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,362
Why would he do that?

448
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,739
So we'd think his plan
was going to work.

449
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:12,285
It's not. There was
never going to be
a duplicate<i> Defiant--</i>

450
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:17,039
just one-- and Yedrin
wanted to make sure
it went back in time.

451
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,584
So that history
would repeat itself.

452
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:23,296
If I hadn't realized
what he had done,

453
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:26,382
we would have
ended up stranded here

454
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,675
and Kira would have died.

455
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,935
You betrayed us.

456
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:39,812
You betrayed<i> me.</i>

457
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:42,731
You call yourself
Yedrin Dax,

458
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,984
but I don't recognize you.

459
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,362
Now that you know,
what are you going
to do about it?

460
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:50,739
What do you think?
Oh, damn it, Ben!

461
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,368
If you don't take
the<i> Defiant</i> back in time,

462
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:56,412
the 8,000 people
on this planet
will cease to exist!

463
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,080
You think I don't care?

464
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,458
Oh, come on, you know
me better than that.

465
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,418
What am I supposed to do?

466
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:05,796
Recreate the accident
and deliberately maroon
my crew?

467
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:08,841
That's what would have happened.
Who's to say that's not
what's<i> supposed</i> to happen?

468
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,469
I'm not going to stand here
and argue philosophy with you.

469
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:13,679
I have a duty
to protect my people.

470
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,556
Look around you, Benjamin.

471
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:19,726
Think of the things that you've
seen since you got here.

472
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,895
<i>This</i> is what your crew

473
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,564
and their descendants
will build if you let
history play itself out.

474
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:27,567
I'm not saying
that it won't be hard at first,

475
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,863
but they will have
good lives here, happy lives.

476
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:35,575
What about Kira?
If we don't get her back
to the station, she'll die.

477
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,246
Is one life too much to ask
if it saves 8,000?

478
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,623
Who are you to decide
who lives or dies?

479
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,376
Who are you to
make that call?!

480
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:45,044
I<i> have</i> to make that call

481
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,087
because I'm responsible
for what happened here.

482
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,134
Jadzia knows what
I'm talking about.

483
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,679
She's the one
who insisted

484
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,349
that the<i> Defiant</i>
<i>investigate this planet.</i>

485
00:25:58,349 --> 00:25:59,892
You know as well as I do

486
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,977
that you should have
been more careful--

487
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,562
you should have seen that
the barrier was unstable

488
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,023
when you scanned it.

489
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:09,276
But I didn't.

490
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:13,780
I was so bent on making
some great discovery...

491
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,282
that I missed it.

492
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,535
And because of you,
because of me,

493
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:21,247
Kira died and 48 people
were stranded here.

494
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,957
You don't know
what it was like

495
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,876
to live with that.

496
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:31,298
For years, Benjamin,
every time I looked at you,

497
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,384
all I could think about
was Jake

498
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:36,720
and how, because of me,
he would never see
his father again.

499
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,764
Eventually, I had
to accept the fact

500
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:42,101
there was nothing
I could do to change things.

501
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,103
I couldn't bring
Kira back.

502
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,897
All I could do was look
to the future, Benjamin,

503
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:49,400
and make sure
that we survived here...

504
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,110
no matter what.

505
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:57,991
This community...
is<i> my</i> responsibility.

506
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:01,412
For two centuries,
I have watched it grow

507
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:04,915
into something to be proud of.

508
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:07,834
For generations,
these people have worked

509
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:10,796
to make a life
for themselves here.

510
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,507
They deserve a chance
to hang on to it.

511
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:16,343
I'm not denying that!

512
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:20,973
I wish there was a way
we could help you,

513
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:24,101
but my people have the right
to return home
to their families,

514
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:26,019
and I will not
ask Kira

515
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,521
to sacrifice
her life

516
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:29,106
for 8,000 people--

517
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,774
for eight million!

518
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,985
No one has the right
to ask that.

519
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:36,071
I'm sorry,
old man,

520
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,949
but there is nothing I can do.

521
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:04,308
Look at them.

522
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:06,893
They have no idea
what's going to happen.

523
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:10,230
It is for the best.
They are children.

524
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,107
They would not
understand.

525
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,527
I'm not sure
I understand.

526
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:17,737
8,000 people, Worf--
they have to die

527
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,697
because I've got to go
back to the station

528
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:22,909
to be treated
for some condition
I can't even tell I have.

529
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,787
That is not the only
reason we are going back.

530
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,333
Do not blame
yourself, Major.

531
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,212
I'm going up to the ship.

532
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:40,010
It would have been
a good crop this year.

533
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,637
Spring came so early.

534
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,431
Miranda...

535
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,225
is something
wrong?

536
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,767
Everyone's so quiet.

537
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:50,479
It's nothing you need
to worry about.

538
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,203
WOMAN:
We came to tell you

539
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:07,871
there will be
no feast tonight.

540
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,666
I understand.

541
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:13,544
This is not a time
for celebration.

542
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:15,713
MAN: Tomorrow,
we will see

543
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:17,590
the sun rise again...

544
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,841
but no one here will see it set.

545
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,262
Join me.
There is something

546
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:24,722
I wish to say.

547
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:40,696
It is... a great honor
to know that my legacy

548
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:43,532
has thrived on your world
for so long.

549
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:48,746
I can see the Klingon heart
beats strong here.

550
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:50,789
You honor us
with your words.

551
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,375
We have tried to live
as you taught us to.

552
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:56,712
We've never plowed fields
or milked chattel.

553
00:29:56,712 --> 00:30:00,257
We've lived as warriors,
hunters.

554
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:03,802
Last year, I slew a yar-bear
three meters tall.

555
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,887
Your<i> mek'leth</i>
<i>was my only weapon.</i>

556
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,515
The beast maimed me,
and for a time,

557
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:11,893
it seemed I would die
from my wounds.

558
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,313
Now I wish I had.

559
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:17,149
It would have been
a warrior's death.

560
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:20,486
He could have taken his place
among the honored dead
in<i> Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

561
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:24,197
Perhaps he will yet.

562
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,575
No.
Ceasing to exist

563
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,910
because my parents
were never born?

564
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,080
That is not a death
worthy of<i> Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

565
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,837
Kill me, Worf.

566
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,424
I have no enemies to fight,
no glory to be won.

567
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:45,010
Give me
an honorable death.

568
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:49,431
Don't make us wait for the end

569
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,850
like farm animals
waiting for slaughter.

570
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,814
I will come to you tomorrow...

571
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:59,232
and do what you ask.

572
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,289
Why did you want
to come back here?

573
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,500
I had to see it again,
so I could be sure.

574
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,293
Sure about what?

575
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:21,087
That this is where I belong.

576
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:24,508
The path the Prophets
laid out for me ends here.

577
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,677
Well, not this time, Nerys.

578
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:28,846
The Captain's taking you
back to DS9.

579
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:30,681
I can't let him do that--

580
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:33,892
not if it's going
to cost 8,000 lives.

581
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,603
No, we have to let
history take its course,

582
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:39,356
even if it means
I have to die here.

583
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,199
What?
Have you lost your mind?

584
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,034
Kira, if we don't go
back to the station,

585
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,661
you'll die within
a few weeks.

586
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,454
There's nothing I
can do for you here.

587
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,832
I know that, Julian,
I've accepted it.

588
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,792
We've got to take
the<i> Defiant</i> back in time.

589
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:01,044
Otherwise,
we're cheating fate.

590
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,296
Well, I wouldn't mind
cheating fate all the way
home to the station.

591
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,923
DAX:
Neither would I,

592
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,884
but if we go home,
8,000 people

593
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:08,719
are going to cease to exist.

594
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:11,054
I don't know those people,

595
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:14,057
but I have a wife and kids
back home who need me.

596
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,017
Your family
will be fine, Miles.

597
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,811
The Prophets
will take care of them.

598
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:21,523
No offense, but I don't
believe in your Prophets.

599
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:23,609
All Major Kira is saying
is our families

600
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:26,403
will survive
no matter what we do.
The colonists will not.

601
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:29,656
If she is willing
to sacrifice her life
to save them,

602
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,658
I am willing
to remain here.

603
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,243
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

604
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:34,870
You hardly ever
see your son.

605
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,080
And you are afraid
to face your destiny.

606
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,793
Look, we can sit here
and argue about destiny

607
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:42,669
till we're blue in the face,

608
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,255
but the bottom line is,
nobody has the right

609
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:47,382
to tell me I can't
go home to my family.

610
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,885
I want to go home
as much as you do, Chief.

611
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,429
I'm just listening to
what everyone has to say.

612
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,765
So we're not actually
considering this?

613
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,227
No, we're not.

614
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,687
Captain?!

615
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:04,733
Major, you've made
your position clear.

616
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:12,157
All right, people,
dismissed.

617
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:36,974
By sunset,
this will all be gone.

618
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,477
Taking a last
look around?

619
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,772
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

620
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,899
Gabriel, where are you going
in such a hurry?

621
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,861
To the fields.
It's time for planting.

622
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,540
Come on, Gabriel.

623
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,500
There isn't
much time.

624
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:06,712
Put some of this
on your face.

625
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,672
The sun is
strong today.

626
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,135
Planting day has always
been important here.

627
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,929
It brings
everyone together.

628
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,765
Somehow it feels right
to see it through.

629
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:48,921
Oh, here's one for you.
Thanks.

630
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:51,631
Molly, take that
from the bottom.

631
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,132
Thank you.

632
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:58,597
Thank you.

633
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,567
The status report
you asked for, sir.

634
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,653
The repairs are finished.

635
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,864
The<i> Defiant's</i> ready
to leave orbit.

636
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,532
Aren't you going to help?

637
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,701
I'm busy.

638
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:20,827
You don't look busy.

639
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,121
(<i> laughing</i> )

640
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,082
She's an O'Brien,
all right.

641
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:27,417
Better get to it, Chief.

642
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,671
(<i> laughing</i> )

643
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,357
You said there was
an enemy for us to fight.

644
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,443
They are attempting
to plant their fields

645
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:55,236
before the sun sets.

646
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,656
Time is their enemy.

647
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,908
We should help them defeat it.

648
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,245
Bring the others.

649
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,476
Oh, great.

650
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,816
You know...

651
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,526
I have a little girl
named Molly, too.

652
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:35,694
Really?
Mm-hmm.

653
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,278
Can I meet her?

654
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,073
We'll see.

655
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,410
By summer, this plant
will be taller than you.

656
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,287
After the harvest,
I'll help my mother

657
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,956
make gelm bread
with it.

658
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,501
WOMAN:
Molly.

659
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,856
Something wrong?

660
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,359
We can't do it.
What?

661
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,904
We can't let
these people die.

662
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,448
(<i> children laughing</i> )

663
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,702
You're it.

664
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,547
The navigational logs
from the original crash--

665
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:39,758
download them
into the ship's autopilot

666
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,384
and it'll match
the original trajectory.

667
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,969
That should send
the<i> Defiant</i> back

668
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,055
to the right
point in time.

669
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,059
I don't know...

670
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:52,187
how to thank you
for what you're doing.

671
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:53,897
We'd better go, Benjamin.

672
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,732
There isn't
much time.

673
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,423
You can't do this.

674
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,550
Please don't make
this any harder
than it already is.

675
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,178
You have to go home,
Nerys-- you have to.
This isn't about me.

676
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,639
This is about the 8,000
people down on that planet,

677
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,432
their children
and their grandchildren.

678
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,184
What about the children
who'll never be born

679
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:32,978
because the<i> Defiant</i>
<i>doesn't return to DS9?</i>

680
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,395
They don't exist yet.

681
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:35,814
These people do.

682
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:38,150
Nerys, just tell
me one thing.

683
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,903
If you'd known how
I felt about you,

684
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,990
if I'd said
something years ago,

685
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,993
do you think things might
have been different?

686
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:50,787
Maybe.

687
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:14,269
Has everyone had a chance

688
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,813
to record a message
to their families?

689
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:19,065
I've downloaded the recordings
into a class-4 probe.

690
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,193
It'll start transmitting
a location signal

691
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:23,236
as soon as it
clears the barrier.

692
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,702
Launch the probe, Chief.

693
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,832
It's time.

694
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:39,002
SISKO:
Transfer helm control
to autopilot.

695
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:44,841
Autopilot engaged.

696
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,467
Raise shields.

697
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,220
DAX:
Aye, sir.

698
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,141
WORF:
We are breaking orbit.

699
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:56,519
Coming around
to 42 mark seven.

700
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:00,190
I'm picking up
an unusual temporal signature.

701
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:03,526
It's the anomaly.
We're headed straight for it.

702
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,120
Ten seconds to impact.

703
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,122
Eight...
seven...

704
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:19,751
six...
five... four...

705
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,586
We're veering away
from the anomaly.

706
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,798
Try to override
the autopilot.

707
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,259
I can't.

708
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:29,261
We're clearing the barrier.

709
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,480
What happened?

710
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,233
Someone changed our flight plan.

711
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,945
It wasn't me.

712
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,115
Scan the surface.

713
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:54,160
No sign of the settlement...

714
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,413
or the inhabitants.

715
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,665
Everything's gone.

716
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,343
Whoever changed
our flight plan

717
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:12,304
knew their way around
the computer system.

718
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:14,222
They bypassed our
security protocols

719
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,807
without leaving a trace.

720
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,850
It must have been
someone from the crew.

721
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,979
Or someone who used to be.

722
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,689
Yedrin?
Hmm.

723
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:26,192
But all he cared about
was the settlement.

724
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,236
What could have
changed his mind?

725
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:30,322
Seeing us again.

726
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:32,157
Perhaps he decided

727
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:34,492
he couldn't let us
go through with it.

728
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,248
Everyone we met...

729
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:43,251
they never existed.

730
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:47,130
They existed.

731
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:52,260
As long as we remember them...
they always will.

732
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,436
(<i> door chimes</i> )

733
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,651
Come in.

734
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:15,992
Odo.

735
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,999
There's something
you should know.

736
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:26,044
The other Odo,
the one from the planet...

737
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,548
came to Sick Bay
before he left the ship.

738
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:32,842
Oh?

739
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:34,969
He linked with me.

740
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,724
(<i> clears throat</i> )

741
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:45,604
Now... I know everything
that happened.

742
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:53,321
The, uh... other day,
when I told you

743
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:56,408
about Shakaar and... me

744
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:58,493
not seeing each other
anymore...

745
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,247
you seemed so uncomfortable.

746
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:04,790
I had come to accept the fact

747
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,502
that you were involved
with someone else.

748
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:12,590
Then suddenly
everything changed.

749
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:16,428
I don't know what to say.

750
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:19,055
I'm still trying
to sort everything out.

751
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:21,807
So am I.

752
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:27,522
I think we both need some time.

753
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:35,821
There's something else the
other Odo wanted you to know.

754
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:42,620
He was responsible for changing
the<i> Defiant's</i> flight plan.

755
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,834
Why?

756
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:52,589
So that you
wouldn't have to die.

757
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,759
I can't believe it.

758
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,513
8,000 people.

759
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:02,640
He did it for you, Nerys.

760
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,476
He loved you.

761
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:06,436
That makes it right?!

762
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,981
I don't know.

763
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,776
He thought so.

764
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,284
I'll see you in the morning.
