1
00:00:02,197 --> 00:00:05,898
Captain's Log, Stardate 50814.2.

2
00:00:05,938 --> 00:00:08,307
The <i>Defiant</i> is returning
to Deep Space 9

3
00:00:08,343 --> 00:00:10,644
after a week-long
reconnaissance mission

4
00:00:10,682 --> 00:00:12,515
in the Gamma Quadrant.

5
00:00:12,552 --> 00:00:15,753
I can't wait to get home
and sleep in my own bed.

6
00:00:15,793 --> 00:00:18,663
The bunks on this ship
are so uncomfortable.

7
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:20,692
You know what I could use?

8
00:00:20,737 --> 00:00:22,935
A weekend at the Golian spa.

9
00:00:22,976 --> 00:00:26,815
Mmm... maybe you and Shakaar
can slip away when we get back.

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,321
We're not seeing
each other anymore.

11
00:00:29,356 --> 00:00:30,916
When did this happen?

12
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:32,758
Last week.

13
00:00:32,797 --> 00:00:35,598
No wonder you've been
so down lately.

14
00:00:35,637 --> 00:00:37,733
I miss him.

15
00:00:37,774 --> 00:00:39,505
But the last time
we were on Bajor

16
00:00:39,545 --> 00:00:41,641
we went to the Kenda shrine
and we asked the Prophets

17
00:00:41,683 --> 00:00:43,881
if we were meant
to walk the same path.

18
00:00:43,922 --> 00:00:45,049
And?

19
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:46,583
We're not.

20
00:00:46,627 --> 00:00:48,597
You make it sound
so cut-and-dry.

21
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,032
Well, the way I see it

22
00:00:50,068 --> 00:00:52,505
people are either
meant to be together

23
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,565
or they're not.

24
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:54,942
I guess I'd rather believe

25
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:57,576
that any relationship
can work as long

26
00:00:57,618 --> 00:01:00,488
as both people
really want it to.

27
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:06,628
I'm not sure I have an opinion
on the subject.

28
00:01:06,671 --> 00:01:07,970
Excuse me.

29
00:01:08,008 --> 00:01:10,069
I need to regenerate.

30
00:01:12,584 --> 00:01:13,951
Is he all right?

31
00:01:13,988 --> 00:01:14,956
You know Odo.

32
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,986
This sort of talk
makes him uncomfortable.

33
00:01:34,365 --> 00:01:35,298
No, thanks.

34
00:01:35,367 --> 00:01:36,836
I'm trying to cut down.

35
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,808
I'm making Molly

36
00:01:38,842 --> 00:01:39,969
a dollhouse for her birthday.

37
00:01:40,011 --> 00:01:41,605
Oh. Thank you.

38
00:01:41,648 --> 00:01:44,587
The house itself was easy,
but the furniture...

39
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:46,717
even with a microlathe,
I'm not sure I'm going

40
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,194
to get it all finished in time.

41
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,793
I guess her dolls are going
to have to rough it for a while.

42
00:01:50,835 --> 00:01:52,236
Interesting.

43
00:01:52,272 --> 00:01:53,901
I'm getting
some unusual readings

44
00:01:53,942 --> 00:01:55,103
from a nearby solar system.

45
00:01:55,144 --> 00:01:56,977
What kind of readings?

46
00:01:57,015 --> 00:01:59,350
There's some sort
of energy barrier

47
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:01,390
surrounding the fourth planet.

48
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:03,258
It's hard to tell
from the interference

49
00:02:03,296 --> 00:02:05,460
but there could be life-forms
on the surface.

50
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,131
If there are, I'd be interested
to see how they've adapted

51
00:02:08,173 --> 00:02:10,109
to the quantum fluctuations
in the barrier.

52
00:02:10,144 --> 00:02:12,411
Can't we check it out
the next time we come this way?

53
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:14,180
It'll be too late.

54
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,953
At the rate the interference
is intensifying

55
00:02:16,992 --> 00:02:19,122
in a few weeks,
we won't even be able to send

56
00:02:19,164 --> 00:02:20,724
- a probe through it.
- Dax...

57
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:24,034
I know everyone wants to go home

58
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:26,342
but if we're going to take
a look at this planet

59
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,780
it'll be our only chance.

60
00:02:27,816 --> 00:02:30,846
Are you sure it's safe to pass
through the interference?

61
00:02:33,162 --> 00:02:37,160
A few shield modifications,
and it should be smooth sailing.

62
00:02:41,312 --> 00:02:43,373
All right,
we'll make a quick survey

63
00:02:43,484 --> 00:02:46,149
but if all we detect
is some fungus

64
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,489
we're not beaming down.

65
00:02:47,526 --> 00:02:50,293
What if it's smart fungus?

66
00:02:58,751 --> 00:03:00,915
We're approaching the barrier.

67
00:03:00,956 --> 00:03:03,257
All right, old man,
take us in.

68
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:09,206
Adjusting shield harmonics
to compensate.

69
00:03:11,378 --> 00:03:13,007
Quantum fluctuations
are intensifying.

70
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:22,402
We're through.

71
00:03:28,283 --> 00:03:29,410
Are you all right?

72
00:03:29,452 --> 00:03:31,388
I think so.

73
00:03:31,422 --> 00:03:32,412
Dr. Bashir to the Bridge.

74
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,224
No, I'm fine.

75
00:03:34,262 --> 00:03:35,423
The inertial dampers
are off-line

76
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:39,836
and the gyromagnetic stabilizers
are depolarized.

77
00:03:40,977 --> 00:03:43,312
We're going to be here
for a few days.

78
00:03:44,151 --> 00:03:46,178
Smooth sailing.

79
00:03:46,222 --> 00:03:49,389
Sir, we are being hailed
from the surface.

80
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,989
There are several
scattered settlements

81
00:03:51,032 --> 00:03:52,296
across the southern peninsula.

82
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:55,638
I am reading approximately...
8,000 inhabitants.

83
00:03:55,675 --> 00:03:56,974
They appear to be human.

84
00:03:57,012 --> 00:03:58,914
On screen.

85
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:01,888
Welcome to Gaia, Captain Sisko.

86
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,291
You know my name?

87
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,523
We've been expecting you.

88
00:04:05,564 --> 00:04:07,397
It's a long story, Benjamin.

89
00:04:07,435 --> 00:04:08,425
Why don't you come down

90
00:04:08,538 --> 00:04:10,132
and we'll talk about it
over some <i>raktajino?</i>

91
00:04:10,175 --> 00:04:12,202
Oh, I forgot.

92
00:04:12,245 --> 00:04:13,839
You're trying to cut down.

93
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:39,061
Miranda O'Brien.

94
00:04:39,105 --> 00:04:41,075
Yedrin...

95
00:04:41,109 --> 00:04:42,908
Yedrin Dax.

96
00:04:43,948 --> 00:04:46,009
What a coincidence.

97
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:47,522
Would one of you
mind telling us

98
00:04:47,557 --> 00:04:48,525
what's going on?

99
00:04:48,626 --> 00:04:51,291
This settlement was
founded by the crew

100
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:53,392
of a Starfleet vessel
that crashed

101
00:04:53,436 --> 00:04:54,803
on this planet
two centuries ago.

102
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:58,335
I realize this is going to be
hard for you to accept

103
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,545
but that ship was the <i>Defiant.</i>

104
00:05:00,652 --> 00:05:03,682
Two days from now,
when you leave here

105
00:05:03,725 --> 00:05:05,718
and try to pass through
the energy barrier

106
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:09,396
you will be thrown
back in time 200 years.

107
00:05:09,438 --> 00:05:11,169
You'll be stranded here

108
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,238
and become the founders
of this settlement.

109
00:05:14,282 --> 00:05:18,485
We... are your descendants.

110
00:07:18,823 --> 00:07:20,315
Go ahead, Jadzia, scan me.

111
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,729
You'll find the Dax
symbiont right here.

112
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:26,736
It's true.

113
00:07:26,773 --> 00:07:28,766
The symbiont
has been passed down

114
00:07:28,811 --> 00:07:31,282
to Jadzia's descendants
for three generations.

115
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:35,224
I remember all of you
like it was yesterday.

116
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:37,229
If you scan Miranda,
you'll find that her DNA

117
00:07:37,263 --> 00:07:39,427
is substantially similar
to that of the Chief's.

118
00:07:45,615 --> 00:07:48,109
She's an O'Brien, all right.

119
00:07:48,154 --> 00:07:49,487
And a Tannenbaum, too.

120
00:07:49,524 --> 00:07:51,859
You mean Ensign Tannenbaum?

121
00:07:51,896 --> 00:07:53,422
From Engineering?

122
00:07:54,435 --> 00:07:57,431
You and Rita were married

123
00:07:57,474 --> 00:07:59,877
ten years
after the <i>Defiant</i> crashed.

124
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,712
You were trapped here, Miles,
200 years in the past.

125
00:08:02,753 --> 00:08:04,052
There was no going home.

126
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,078
There was no chance

127
00:08:05,124 --> 00:08:06,821
of ever seeing
your family again.

128
00:08:06,895 --> 00:08:08,558
You were the last
to give up hope

129
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:11,936
but, eventually, you had to make
a new life for yourself here.

130
00:08:14,712 --> 00:08:16,113
Mm-hmm.

131
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:18,382
I know that face, Benjamin.

132
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,445
You're still not convinced

133
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,857
that we're telling
you the truth.

134
00:08:20,925 --> 00:08:24,626
All right, if you want,
I could tell you something

135
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:26,500
that only Curzon would know.

136
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,872
Do you remember that dancer
that you met on Pelios Station?

137
00:08:30,914 --> 00:08:31,882
The one that?

138
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:33,784
That... that'll do.

139
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:34,811
Thank you.

140
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:38,758
Are you the son of Mogh?

141
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,002
Yes, I am.

142
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:47,073
Is it true you can kill someone
just by looking at them?

143
00:08:49,923 --> 00:08:51,756
Only when I am angry.

144
00:08:53,063 --> 00:08:55,296
Why don't we go inside?

145
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:56,895
You can meet
some of the others later.

146
00:08:56,939 --> 00:08:59,206
We still have
a lot to talk about.

147
00:09:04,488 --> 00:09:06,515
Ready for the next problem?

148
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,562
Say you have 27 tessipates

149
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:14,229
of land you want to plant
with nice, juicy yelg melons.

150
00:09:14,272 --> 00:09:16,299
This is our meeting hall,
which, as you can see

151
00:09:16,344 --> 00:09:17,779
we sometimes use
as a schoolroom.

152
00:09:17,814 --> 00:09:21,549
...needs one square kerripate
of land to grow in

153
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:24,892
what is the total number
of melons you can plant?

154
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:27,264
Let me know as soon
as you have an answer.

155
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:30,102
Jadzia designed it
as an educational program.

156
00:09:30,141 --> 00:09:31,302
She took Quark's image

157
00:09:31,344 --> 00:09:33,246
from the security logs
of the <i>Defiant.</i>

158
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,271
I've always thought

159
00:09:34,316 --> 00:09:36,115
that Quark would make
a great math teacher.

160
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:39,151
He's so good with numbers.

161
00:09:39,194 --> 00:09:40,857
I like your spots.

162
00:09:40,898 --> 00:09:42,390
Most people don't have them

163
00:09:42,435 --> 00:09:44,496
because our ancestors
were mostly human.

164
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,604
My mom says
they make me special.

165
00:09:47,646 --> 00:09:51,815
It's just genetics, Lisa,
like... Torvin's ridges.

166
00:09:51,855 --> 00:09:53,848
You're just jealous, Molly.

167
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:56,194
Molly?

168
00:09:56,232 --> 00:09:58,328
Oh, yes, you'll find
a lot of them here.

169
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:00,738
The name has been passed down
through the O'Brien line.

170
00:10:00,775 --> 00:10:02,142
Molly, this is

171
00:10:02,178 --> 00:10:05,242
your grandfather's
great-great-great-grandfather.

172
00:10:05,284 --> 00:10:07,414
Hello.

173
00:10:07,456 --> 00:10:09,016
Hi.

174
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,397
How much were we...

175
00:10:12,434 --> 00:10:15,498
were you able to salvage
from the <i>Defiant?</i>

176
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,637
A portable generator,
a replicator

177
00:10:17,678 --> 00:10:20,651
a few phasers, tricorders,
things of that sort.

178
00:10:20,685 --> 00:10:23,681
Did anybody ever try
to send out a distress signal?

179
00:10:23,793 --> 00:10:25,228
To who?
It was 200 years ago.

180
00:10:25,262 --> 00:10:27,095
The wormhole hadn't even
been discovered yet.

181
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:29,604
There was no way back
to the Alpha Quadrant.

182
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:32,236
Our ancestors decided
to make this their new home.

183
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:34,180
And they needed
a shelter quickly

184
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:35,650
before winter came.

185
00:10:35,685 --> 00:10:36,653
This is it.

186
00:10:36,687 --> 00:10:38,657
This is the oldest building
there is.

187
00:10:38,692 --> 00:10:41,323
At first, everyone
had to sleep here...

188
00:10:41,364 --> 00:10:42,958
all 48 of them.

189
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:45,165
Forty-eight?

190
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:47,233
Ah...

191
00:10:47,277 --> 00:10:50,512
Kira died
a few weeks after the crash.

192
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:52,988
The energy discharge
that struck her on the Bridge

193
00:10:53,023 --> 00:10:55,551
damaged her neural pathways.

194
00:10:55,596 --> 00:10:57,498
The <i>Defiant</i> didn't have
the medical equipment

195
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:58,866
that Julian needed to treat her.

196
00:10:58,903 --> 00:11:00,600
You want to see
where she was buried?

197
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:03,378
Maybe later.

198
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,610
Girls, why don't you run along
and help your parents?

199
00:11:05,651 --> 00:11:06,846
It's almost time for planting

200
00:11:06,887 --> 00:11:08,823
and there's a lot of work
to be done.

201
00:11:08,858 --> 00:11:11,091
- Bye.
- Bye.

202
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,244
Obviously, we need to get Kira

203
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:20,340
back to the station
for treatment

204
00:11:20,383 --> 00:11:22,718
as soon as we
can repair the <i>Defiant.</i>

205
00:11:22,755 --> 00:11:23,723
Of course.

206
00:11:23,758 --> 00:11:26,195
I don't quite know
how to say this

207
00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:29,030
but now that we know
about the accident

208
00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:33,671
that sent the ship back in time,
we should be able to avoid it.

209
00:11:33,712 --> 00:11:37,174
Well, if we do that,
your timeline will collapse

210
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,714
and everything here
will cease to exist.

211
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,096
Not necessarily.

212
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:44,796
I have a plan.

213
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:49,610
And the key is what happened
to Kira on the Bridge.

214
00:11:49,648 --> 00:11:51,949
This energy discharge

215
00:11:51,986 --> 00:11:53,785
caused a subspace
doubling effect.

216
00:11:53,824 --> 00:11:56,352
For an instant,
every molecule in her body

217
00:11:56,396 --> 00:11:58,560
had a corresponding
quantum duplicate.

218
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,627
There were literally two Kiras.

219
00:12:00,672 --> 00:12:01,765
Go on.

220
00:12:01,807 --> 00:12:03,937
If we make
certain modifications

221
00:12:03,979 --> 00:12:05,778
to the <i>Defiant's</i> systems

222
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,481
we should be able to amplify
this doubling effect

223
00:12:08,522 --> 00:12:12,361
and create a quantum duplicate
of the entire ship.

224
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,368
When you encounter
the temporal anomaly

225
00:12:14,402 --> 00:12:15,962
the duplicate will be thrown

226
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:18,203
back into the past,
and the original...

227
00:12:18,244 --> 00:12:22,015
you... will pass through
the barrier unaffected.

228
00:12:23,522 --> 00:12:25,686
So you're saying we go home

229
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,321
and your timeline is preserved.

230
00:12:27,364 --> 00:12:29,699
Exactly.

231
00:12:29,736 --> 00:12:31,763
What do you think?

232
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:33,777
It might work.

233
00:12:33,811 --> 00:12:37,114
Now, according to the logs
I retrieved from the wreckage

234
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:40,021
the <i>Defiant</i> encountered
the anomaly 39 hours

235
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:41,322
after it arrived in orbit.

236
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:44,994
If your plan is to work,
we must do the same.

237
00:12:45,036 --> 00:12:48,532
There are almost 8,000 people
living on this planet.

238
00:12:48,577 --> 00:12:52,073
This is
the only chance they have.

239
00:12:54,456 --> 00:12:58,795
Dax, I want a full evaluation
as soon as possible.

240
00:12:58,832 --> 00:13:01,497
If the plan is sound,
start making

241
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:04,443
the modifications immediately.

242
00:13:06,215 --> 00:13:08,117
Thank you, Benjamin.

243
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,680
Anything for you...

244
00:13:10,926 --> 00:13:12,225
old man.

245
00:13:21,015 --> 00:13:23,543
Apparently, the planet
is crawling with Bashirs.

246
00:13:23,587 --> 00:13:24,886
Maybe I'll stay up here.

247
00:13:25,926 --> 00:13:27,053
How's Odo?

248
00:13:27,094 --> 00:13:28,358
He's resting comfortably.

249
00:13:28,398 --> 00:13:29,627
He can't hold his shape

250
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:32,537
because of the quantum
fluctuations inside the barrier.

251
00:13:32,574 --> 00:13:34,441
Sweet dreams, Odo.

252
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:39,579
But he'll be as right as rain
as soon as we leave orbit.

253
00:13:39,622 --> 00:13:42,595
You, on the other hand...

254
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:46,030
are going to have to undergo

255
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,596
a complete
neural pathway induction

256
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,337
as soon as we get back
to the station.

257
00:13:49,377 --> 00:13:50,436
If you say so.

258
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:51,469
I feel fine.

259
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:53,144
That's because
your neural tissue

260
00:13:53,186 --> 00:13:54,712
hasn't begun
to deteriorate yet

261
00:13:54,756 --> 00:13:56,248
but rest assured

262
00:13:56,292 --> 00:14:00,563
you'll be on my operating table
eventually.

263
00:14:00,602 --> 00:14:01,901
Hey...

264
00:14:01,971 --> 00:14:03,406
where you off to?

265
00:14:03,441 --> 00:14:07,746
I have to get down there,
meet some of those Bashirs.

266
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:22,605
Hello, Nerys.

267
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,122
Odo?

268
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:29,723
I came up from the surface as
soon as I heard you were here.

269
00:14:29,765 --> 00:14:32,532
How... how are you
holding your shape?

270
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:33,836
I... I thought...

271
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,639
I learned to counter
the barrier's effects

272
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:36,669
a long time ago.

273
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,456
It's good to see you.

274
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:45,289
You look different.

275
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,326
I've gotten better
at shape-shifting

276
00:14:47,372 --> 00:14:48,431
over the years.

277
00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:55,018
You're as beautiful
as I remember.

278
00:14:56,157 --> 00:15:00,030
You can't know how I've longed
to hear your voice

279
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,537
see your smile.

280
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:06,979
Odo...
what's gotten into you?

281
00:15:07,014 --> 00:15:08,483
There's something
I want you to know

282
00:15:08,518 --> 00:15:09,885
something I've wanted
to tell you

283
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:11,185
for 200 years.

284
00:15:12,192 --> 00:15:14,663
I love you, Nerys.

285
00:15:14,697 --> 00:15:17,670
I've always loved you.

286
00:15:29,397 --> 00:15:31,800
What do you mean, you love me?

287
00:15:31,836 --> 00:15:34,740
Is it so hard to believe?

288
00:15:37,915 --> 00:15:40,614
I never knew
you felt that way about me.

289
00:15:40,654 --> 00:15:42,385
I did everything I could

290
00:15:42,426 --> 00:15:44,954
to make sure you
wouldn't find out.

291
00:15:46,935 --> 00:15:48,802
Uh...

292
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:50,068
it worked.

293
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:53,749
Why didn't you
ever say anything?

294
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:58,424
I didn't think you
could possibly care for me

295
00:15:58,461 --> 00:16:00,226
the way I care for you.

296
00:16:00,265 --> 00:16:02,793
I suppose I was afraid
of ruining what we had.

297
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,967
Our friendship meant
everything to me.

298
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:06,478
It still does.

299
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:10,553
Maybe I shouldn't
have said anything.

300
00:16:10,587 --> 00:16:11,886
It's not that.

301
00:16:13,594 --> 00:16:15,963
I was just thinking
about all the times

302
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:19,063
I came to you for advice
about Shakaar and Bareil.

303
00:16:19,106 --> 00:16:21,339
It must have been
very hard for you

304
00:16:21,377 --> 00:16:23,905
to listen to me
go on about another man.

305
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,977
No, I can't say I enjoyed it.

306
00:16:26,021 --> 00:16:28,925
But I wanted to be
a good friend to you.

307
00:16:29,964 --> 00:16:31,695
You were.

308
00:16:31,734 --> 00:16:35,299
Nerys, I didn't come
here expecting you

309
00:16:35,342 --> 00:16:38,109
to throw yourself into my arms.

310
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:40,047
But you're leaving here
in two days.

311
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:42,956
I'm never going
to see you again.

312
00:16:42,992 --> 00:16:44,461
All I'm asking

313
00:16:44,495 --> 00:16:46,932
is that you spend
some time with me.

314
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:48,994
Gaia is a very beautiful place.

315
00:16:49,038 --> 00:16:50,905
I'd love to show it to you.

316
00:16:57,056 --> 00:16:58,958
I'd like that.

317
00:17:00,898 --> 00:17:02,390
He has your eyes.

318
00:17:02,434 --> 00:17:04,837
Do you think so?
You think so?

319
00:17:04,873 --> 00:17:06,240
Dax to Sisko.

320
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,244
Go ahead.

321
00:17:07,278 --> 00:17:08,139
Good news, Benjamin.

322
00:17:08,272 --> 00:17:09,969
I've gone over the sensor
logs from the crash.

323
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,502
It looks like Yedrin's plan

324
00:17:11,546 --> 00:17:14,143
to create a duplicate <i>Defiant</i>
is going to work.

325
00:17:14,186 --> 00:17:15,746
Di-di-did you hear that?

326
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:19,160
Yes, everything's going
to be all right.

327
00:17:19,197 --> 00:17:20,598
Yes, yes...

328
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:22,034
Sounds like you
have your hands full

329
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,038
down there, Benjamin.

330
00:17:23,072 --> 00:17:24,666
Yes, you could say that.

331
00:17:24,775 --> 00:17:26,836
We'll keep you posted.

332
00:17:34,897 --> 00:17:36,696
Thirsty?

333
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:38,865
The Captain asked me
to make a survey

334
00:17:38,906 --> 00:17:40,500
of the settlement's
infrastructure

335
00:17:40,543 --> 00:17:42,878
so we can leave behind
the appropriate supplies.

336
00:17:42,915 --> 00:17:44,714
I've just been doing the
same thing at the clinic.

337
00:17:44,786 --> 00:17:46,312
I met one of my descendants
there...

338
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:50,661
my great-great-great-
great-granddaughter.

339
00:17:50,699 --> 00:17:51,928
The doctor.

340
00:17:51,969 --> 00:17:54,167
She made quite a fuss over me.

341
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:55,402
Apparently, my healing touch

342
00:17:55,443 --> 00:17:57,072
is something of a legend
around here.

343
00:17:57,113 --> 00:17:59,607
They're here!
They're here!

344
00:17:59,652 --> 00:18:01,144
Who?

345
00:18:01,189 --> 00:18:02,818
The Klingons.

346
00:18:06,634 --> 00:18:08,570
<i>Qapla'.</i>

347
00:18:08,605 --> 00:18:11,076
<i>Qapla'.</i>

348
00:18:11,111 --> 00:18:12,978
We are the Sons of Mogh.

349
00:18:13,983 --> 00:18:15,850
You are my descendants.

350
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:18,951
Some by blood,
some by choice.

351
00:18:18,994 --> 00:18:20,554
Our hearts are Klingon.

352
00:18:20,598 --> 00:18:21,691
We live as warriors

353
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:24,205
just as you taught
our ancestors long ago.

354
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:26,608
I'm going to be
one of them someday.

355
00:18:26,644 --> 00:18:29,275
I'll ride a wild torga
and go hunting

356
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:30,844
and only come to the settlement

357
00:18:30,887 --> 00:18:32,652
to trade furs
for the things I need.

358
00:18:32,692 --> 00:18:34,890
When you're older, you'll have
the chance to prove yourself.

359
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:36,956
If you are worthy

360
00:18:37,001 --> 00:18:39,905
you can take a Klingon name
and live among us.

361
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,711
The Sons of Mogh are gathering
to celebrate your return.

362
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:46,084
It would honor us greatly
if you would feast

363
00:18:46,121 --> 00:18:47,316
with us tonight.

364
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,254
I look forward to it.

365
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:51,732
We'll come for you at nightfall.

366
00:18:55,141 --> 00:18:56,804
Well, it would appear

367
00:18:56,912 --> 00:18:59,748
that I'm not the only legend
around here.

368
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,063
Once the emitter array
is recalibrated

369
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,571
we can start synchronizing
the shield generators.

370
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:10,767
Oh, good.

371
00:19:10,808 --> 00:19:11,798
We're ahead of schedule.

372
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:16,142
What?

373
00:19:16,187 --> 00:19:18,054
Tell me.

374
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:20,061
You just reminded me
of something.

375
00:19:20,095 --> 00:19:21,962
The summer after the crash

376
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,973
it was so hot,
Jadzia cut her hair short.

377
00:19:25,006 --> 00:19:26,475
Worf hated it.

378
00:19:27,846 --> 00:19:30,079
I remember promising
to grow it back

379
00:19:30,117 --> 00:19:31,677
in time for the wedding.

380
00:19:31,721 --> 00:19:33,919
We got married?

381
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:35,451
Mm-hmm.

382
00:19:35,496 --> 00:19:37,329
The next fall.

383
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:39,497
Benjamin performed the ceremony.

384
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:43,138
I'll never forget Worf's voice
as he said his vows.

385
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:45,514
It was shaking.

386
00:19:48,424 --> 00:19:50,155
Were we happy together?

387
00:19:50,195 --> 00:19:51,721
Mm-hmm.

388
00:19:51,765 --> 00:19:53,530
He's a good man, Jadzia.

389
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:56,007
I know.

390
00:19:56,042 --> 00:19:59,573
It's just, sometimes...

391
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:02,486
he's so hard
to get along with.

392
00:20:02,522 --> 00:20:03,855
Don't worry.

393
00:20:03,892 --> 00:20:05,191
You'll learn to handle him.

394
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:10,502
Did I mention she was a doctor?

395
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,203
Twice.

396
00:20:12,243 --> 00:20:14,646
Well, she showed me
pictures of the family

397
00:20:14,682 --> 00:20:16,311
going all the way
back to me.

398
00:20:16,353 --> 00:20:18,449
You know who I ended up with
after the crash?

399
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,221
Angie Kirby.

400
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,060
Who's that?

401
00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:23,432
Yeah, that's what I said.

402
00:20:23,468 --> 00:20:25,028
Apparently, she transferred
aboard last week.

403
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:26,039
But she's gorgeous.

404
00:20:26,074 --> 00:20:27,064
Congratulations.

405
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,135
You know what?

406
00:20:28,178 --> 00:20:29,943
I think I'm going to ask her out
when we get back.

407
00:20:29,982 --> 00:20:32,215
We obviously
got along well here.

408
00:20:32,254 --> 00:20:36,218
So, you and, uh...

409
00:20:36,263 --> 00:20:37,960
Rita Tannenbaum.

410
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,970
I don't want to hear
about it, Julian.

411
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:41,904
I have a wife
and kids back home.

412
00:20:41,942 --> 00:20:43,673
Sorry.
I didn't mean anything.

413
00:20:43,713 --> 00:20:46,116
You know, I'm going to let you
get back on with your work.

414
00:21:17,153 --> 00:21:19,123
Praying over your own grave.

415
00:21:19,157 --> 00:21:21,492
That's got to be a new one.

416
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:23,123
Yeah.

417
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:26,662
If the Prophets were listening,
they're probably very confused.

418
00:21:26,707 --> 00:21:29,474
Well, I wouldn't blame them.

419
00:21:29,514 --> 00:21:32,145
I've got to tell you, that...

420
00:21:32,186 --> 00:21:35,591
this whole quantum duplicate,
two <i>Defiants</i> thing

421
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,620
has me feeling a little strange.

422
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,893
Why?

423
00:21:38,934 --> 00:21:42,669
Thanks to Yedrin's plan
our timeline is being preserved.

424
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,337
You're going back
to the station

425
00:21:44,379 --> 00:21:45,746
for the treatment you need.

426
00:21:45,782 --> 00:21:47,775
I know. It...

427
00:21:49,056 --> 00:21:51,026
it's just that I've
always believed

428
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,865
that we're all given
one destiny... one path...

429
00:21:54,902 --> 00:21:58,501
and now we're using technology
to get around that.

430
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,345
I'm not sure
how it makes me feel.

431
00:22:02,385 --> 00:22:04,652
I know exactly
how it makes me feel.

432
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:07,689
You can't know
how much it means to me

433
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,632
to know you're going home,
Nerys.

434
00:22:09,668 --> 00:22:12,265
No, it won't change
anything for me.

435
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:16,947
I lost you 200 years ago.

436
00:22:16,984 --> 00:22:20,185
But for the other Odo,
up on the ship

437
00:22:20,224 --> 00:22:22,320
it changes everything.

438
00:22:22,363 --> 00:22:25,530
He doesn't have to lose you.

439
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:28,064
And somehow...

440
00:22:28,109 --> 00:22:30,011
knowing that...

441
00:22:30,046 --> 00:22:32,574
makes me feel better.

442
00:22:34,088 --> 00:22:36,321
Does that make any sense?

443
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,061
You've changed so much, Odo.

444
00:22:40,101 --> 00:22:43,097
I don't just mean
the way you look.

445
00:22:45,112 --> 00:22:48,108
You used to be so closed off.

446
00:22:48,219 --> 00:22:50,452
I have changed.

447
00:22:52,128 --> 00:22:55,624
And the Odo you know
will change, too.

448
00:22:56,838 --> 00:23:00,573
If you're patient with him.

449
00:23:03,086 --> 00:23:05,421
Why don't we head back?

450
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:06,950
Ah.

451
00:23:31,481 --> 00:23:32,973
Nice catch.

452
00:23:34,154 --> 00:23:35,623
Dax.

453
00:23:35,657 --> 00:23:37,126
We need to talk.

454
00:23:37,161 --> 00:23:38,630
Uh-huh.

455
00:23:38,663 --> 00:23:42,125
I was going over the sensor logs
from the crash

456
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:44,165
and I came across something odd.

457
00:23:52,861 --> 00:23:55,162
The quantum fluctuations
in the barrier

458
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,760
factored out to zero.

459
00:23:56,803 --> 00:24:00,436
The chances of that
must be a billion to one.

460
00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:02,108
What are you getting at?

461
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,778
That Yedrin faked the logs.

462
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:05,288
Why would he do that?

463
00:24:05,322 --> 00:24:08,261
So we'd think his plan
was going to work.

464
00:24:08,295 --> 00:24:09,764
It's not.

465
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:11,166
There was never going to be

466
00:24:11,268 --> 00:24:13,033
a duplicate <i>Defiant...</i>
just one...

467
00:24:13,073 --> 00:24:16,808
and Yedrin wanted to make sure
it went back in time.

468
00:24:16,847 --> 00:24:19,820
So that history
would repeat itself.

469
00:24:19,854 --> 00:24:22,827
If I hadn't realized
what he had done

470
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,833
we would have
ended up stranded here

471
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:27,860
and Kira would have died.

472
00:24:34,754 --> 00:24:36,815
You betrayed us.

473
00:24:36,858 --> 00:24:38,760
You betrayed me.

474
00:24:38,795 --> 00:24:41,164
You call yourself Yedrin Dax

475
00:24:41,201 --> 00:24:43,798
but I don't recognize you.

476
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:45,977
Well, now that you know

477
00:24:46,011 --> 00:24:47,378
what are you going
to do about it?

478
00:24:47,415 --> 00:24:48,405
What do you think?

479
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,679
Oh, damn it, Ben!

480
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,149
If you don't take
the <i>Defiant</i> back in time

481
00:24:53,194 --> 00:24:55,358
the 8,000 people on this planet
will cease to exist!

482
00:24:55,398 --> 00:24:57,265
You think I don't care?

483
00:24:57,303 --> 00:24:59,797
Oh, come on, you know
me better than that.

484
00:24:59,842 --> 00:25:01,402
What am I supposed to do?

485
00:25:01,446 --> 00:25:02,641
Recreate the accident

486
00:25:02,681 --> 00:25:04,480
and deliberately maroon
my crew?

487
00:25:04,518 --> 00:25:05,713
That's what would have happened.

488
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:07,919
Who's to say that's not
what's supposed to happen?

489
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:10,795
I'm not going to stand here
and argue philosophy with you.

490
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:13,031
I have a duty
to protect my people.

491
00:25:13,071 --> 00:25:15,167
Look around you, Benjamin.

492
00:25:15,209 --> 00:25:18,444
Think of the things that you've
seen since you got here.

493
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,920
This is what your crew

494
00:25:20,955 --> 00:25:22,184
and their descendants
will build

495
00:25:22,224 --> 00:25:23,625
if you let history
play itself out.

496
00:25:23,661 --> 00:25:26,657
I'm not saying
that it won't be hard at first

497
00:25:26,701 --> 00:25:29,970
but they will have
good lives here, happy lives.

498
00:25:30,008 --> 00:25:31,443
What about Kira?

499
00:25:31,478 --> 00:25:34,451
If we don't get her back
to the station, she'll die.

500
00:25:35,821 --> 00:25:38,060
Is one life too much to ask
if it saves 8,000?

501
00:25:38,193 --> 00:25:40,289
Who are you to decide
who lives or dies?

502
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:42,028
Who are you to make that call?!

503
00:25:42,068 --> 00:25:43,229
I have to make that call

504
00:25:43,271 --> 00:25:45,606
because I'm responsible
for what happened here.

505
00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:51,452
Jadzia knows
what I'm talking about.

506
00:25:52,391 --> 00:25:54,293
She's the one who insisted

507
00:25:54,328 --> 00:25:56,959
that the <i>Defiant</i>
investigate this planet.

508
00:25:57,034 --> 00:25:58,333
You know as well as I do

509
00:25:58,371 --> 00:26:00,501
that you should have
been more careful...

510
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:03,241
you should have seen that
the barrier was unstable

511
00:26:03,282 --> 00:26:06,015
when you scanned it.

512
00:26:06,054 --> 00:26:08,047
But I didn't.

513
00:26:08,091 --> 00:26:12,396
I was so bent on making
some great discovery

514
00:26:12,435 --> 00:26:14,098
that I missed it.

515
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,633
And because of you,
because of me

516
00:26:16,678 --> 00:26:19,947
Kira died and 48 people
were stranded here.

517
00:26:20,018 --> 00:26:24,460
You don't know what it was like
to live with that.

518
00:26:25,965 --> 00:26:29,530
For years, Benjamin,
every time I looked at you

519
00:26:29,572 --> 00:26:33,068
all I could think about was
Jake, and how, because of me

520
00:26:33,113 --> 00:26:35,482
he would never
see his father again.

521
00:26:35,518 --> 00:26:36,987
Eventually, I had
to accept the fact

522
00:26:37,089 --> 00:26:40,824
there was nothing
I could do to change things.

523
00:26:40,864 --> 00:26:42,561
I couldn't bring Kira back.

524
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,733
All I could do was look
to the future, Benjamin

525
00:26:45,775 --> 00:26:48,303
and make sure
that we survived here...

526
00:26:48,347 --> 00:26:50,784
no matter what.

527
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:56,890
This community...
is my responsibility.

528
00:26:56,932 --> 00:27:00,167
For two centuries,
I have watched it grow

529
00:27:00,206 --> 00:27:03,611
into something to be proud of.

530
00:27:03,647 --> 00:27:06,677
For generations,
these people have worked

531
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:09,318
to make a life
for themselves here.

532
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,299
They deserve a chance
to hang on to it.

533
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:15,134
I'm not denying that!

534
00:27:15,173 --> 00:27:19,512
I wish there was a way
we could help you

535
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:22,989
but my people have the right
to return home to their families

536
00:27:23,023 --> 00:27:26,326
and I will not ask Kira
to sacrifice her life

537
00:27:26,364 --> 00:27:29,496
for 8,000 people...
for eight million!

538
00:27:29,537 --> 00:27:31,872
No one has the right
to ask that.

539
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:34,882
I'm sorry, old man

540
00:27:34,916 --> 00:27:37,547
but there is nothing I can do.

541
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,871
Look at them.

542
00:28:02,911 --> 00:28:05,348
They have no idea
what's going to happen.

543
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:08,287
It is for the best.

544
00:28:08,323 --> 00:28:09,348
They are children.

545
00:28:09,392 --> 00:28:10,861
They would not understand.

546
00:28:10,895 --> 00:28:13,230
I'm not sure I understand.

547
00:28:13,266 --> 00:28:15,703
8,000 people, Worf...

548
00:28:15,738 --> 00:28:16,706
they have to die

549
00:28:16,741 --> 00:28:18,837
because I've got to go
back to the station

550
00:28:18,879 --> 00:28:20,473
to be treated
for some condition

551
00:28:20,516 --> 00:28:21,815
I can't even tell I have.

552
00:28:21,853 --> 00:28:24,518
That is not the only
reason we are going back.

553
00:28:25,627 --> 00:28:28,064
Do not blame yourself, Major.

554
00:28:30,004 --> 00:28:31,803
I'm going up to the ship.

555
00:28:36,284 --> 00:28:38,687
It would have been
a good crop this year.

556
00:28:38,723 --> 00:28:40,716
Spring came so early.

557
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,324
Miranda...

558
00:28:43,367 --> 00:28:45,098
is something wrong?

559
00:28:45,137 --> 00:28:46,697
Everyone's so quiet.

560
00:28:46,741 --> 00:28:49,212
It's nothing you need
to worry about.

561
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:06,809
We came to tell you
there will be no feast tonight.

562
00:29:06,851 --> 00:29:09,550
I understand.

563
00:29:09,591 --> 00:29:12,427
This is not a time
for celebration.

564
00:29:12,463 --> 00:29:16,632
Tomorrow, we will see
the sun rise again...

565
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,166
but no one here will see it set.

566
00:29:20,214 --> 00:29:21,147
Join me.

567
00:29:21,216 --> 00:29:23,380
There is something
I wish to say.

568
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:39,451
It is... a great honor
to know that my legacy

569
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:43,089
has thrived on your world
for so long.

570
00:29:43,131 --> 00:29:47,767
I can see the Klingon heart
beats strong here.

571
00:29:47,808 --> 00:29:49,835
You honor us with your words.

572
00:29:49,879 --> 00:29:52,350
We have tried to live
as you taught us to.

573
00:29:52,384 --> 00:29:55,687
We've never plowed fields
or milked chattel.

574
00:29:55,725 --> 00:29:59,028
We've lived as warriors,
hunters.

575
00:29:59,066 --> 00:30:02,437
Last year, I slew a yar-bear
three meters tall.

576
00:30:02,473 --> 00:30:04,876
Your <i>mek'leth</i>
was my only weapon.

577
00:30:04,912 --> 00:30:07,543
The beast maimed me,
and for a time

578
00:30:07,585 --> 00:30:10,820
it seemed I would die
from my wounds.

579
00:30:10,858 --> 00:30:13,386
Now I wish I had.

580
00:30:13,431 --> 00:30:16,164
It would have been
a warrior's death.

581
00:30:16,204 --> 00:30:17,901
He could have taken his place

582
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,308
among the honored dead
in <i>Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

583
00:30:21,448 --> 00:30:23,247
Perhaps he will yet.

584
00:30:23,285 --> 00:30:24,720
No.

585
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:28,093
Ceasing to exist because
my parents were never born?

586
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,931
That is not a death
worthy of <i>Sto-Vo-Kor.</i>

587
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,613
Kill me, Worf.

588
00:30:37,651 --> 00:30:41,456
I have no enemies to fight,
no glory to be won.

589
00:30:41,492 --> 00:30:45,433
Give me an honorable death.

590
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,701
Don't make us wait for the end

591
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,713
like farm animals
waiting for slaughter.

592
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:55,779
I will come to you tomorrow...

593
00:30:55,824 --> 00:30:58,295
and do what you ask.

594
00:31:11,491 --> 00:31:13,324
Why did you want
to come back here?

595
00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:15,798
I had to see it again,
so I could be sure.

596
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:17,303
Sure about what?

597
00:31:17,338 --> 00:31:19,809
That this is where I belong.

598
00:31:19,843 --> 00:31:23,214
The path the Prophets
laid out for me ends here.

599
00:31:23,251 --> 00:31:24,914
Well, not this time, Nerys.

600
00:31:24,954 --> 00:31:27,790
The Captain's taking you
back to DS9.

601
00:31:27,828 --> 00:31:29,798
I can't let him do that...

602
00:31:29,832 --> 00:31:32,360
not if it's going
to cost 8,000 lives.

603
00:31:32,471 --> 00:31:35,672
No, we have to let
history take its course

604
00:31:35,711 --> 00:31:38,376
even if it means
I have to die here.

605
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:47,563
What?
Have you lost your mind?

606
00:31:47,604 --> 00:31:49,540
Kira, if we don't go
back to the station

607
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:50,976
you'll die within a few weeks.

608
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:53,278
There's nothing
I can do for you here.

609
00:31:53,317 --> 00:31:54,616
I know that, Julian,
I've accepted it.

610
00:31:54,653 --> 00:31:57,181
We've got to take
the <i>Defiant</i> back in time.

611
00:31:57,225 --> 00:31:59,423
Otherwise, we're cheating fate.

612
00:31:59,531 --> 00:32:01,057
Yeah, well, I wouldn't
mind cheating fate

613
00:32:01,101 --> 00:32:02,330
all the way home
to the station.

614
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:03,338
Neither would I

615
00:32:03,372 --> 00:32:05,239
but if we go home,
8,000 people

616
00:32:05,277 --> 00:32:07,076
are going to cease to exist.

617
00:32:07,114 --> 00:32:09,084
I don't know those people

618
00:32:09,118 --> 00:32:12,387
but I have a wife and kids
back home who need me.

619
00:32:12,492 --> 00:32:14,223
Your family will be fine, Miles.

620
00:32:14,262 --> 00:32:16,198
The Prophets
will take care of them.

621
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:20,175
No offense, but I don't
believe in your Prophets.

622
00:32:20,209 --> 00:32:22,202
All Major Kira is saying
is our families

623
00:32:22,247 --> 00:32:23,408
will survive
no matter what we do.

624
00:32:23,449 --> 00:32:24,884
The colonists will not.

625
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:26,218
If she is willing

626
00:32:26,256 --> 00:32:28,158
to sacrifice her life
to save them

627
00:32:28,193 --> 00:32:30,323
I am willing to remain here.

628
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,800
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

629
00:32:31,834 --> 00:32:33,098
You hardly ever see your son.

630
00:32:33,138 --> 00:32:35,268
And you are afraid
to face your destiny.

631
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,610
Look, we can sit here
and argue about destiny

632
00:32:39,652 --> 00:32:40,985
till we're blue in the face

633
00:32:41,021 --> 00:32:43,458
but the bottom line is,
nobody has the right

634
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,861
to tell me I can't
go home to my family.

635
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:48,234
I want to go home
as much as you do, Chief.

636
00:32:48,271 --> 00:32:50,868
I'm just listening
to what everyone has to say.

637
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:53,040
So we're not actually
considering this?

638
00:32:56,355 --> 00:32:57,654
No, we're not.

639
00:32:57,691 --> 00:32:59,160
Captain?!

640
00:32:59,195 --> 00:33:03,000
Major, you've made
your position clear.

641
00:33:08,348 --> 00:33:10,318
All right, people, dismissed.

642
00:33:32,434 --> 00:33:35,201
By sunset,
this will all be gone.

643
00:33:37,312 --> 00:33:39,749
Taking a last look around?

644
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:42,118
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

645
00:33:42,156 --> 00:33:44,787
Gabriel, where are you going
in such a hurry?

646
00:33:44,828 --> 00:33:46,127
To the fields.

647
00:33:46,164 --> 00:33:47,827
It's time for planting.

648
00:33:58,792 --> 00:34:00,557
Come on, Gabriel.

649
00:34:00,596 --> 00:34:02,327
There isn't much time.

650
00:34:02,366 --> 00:34:04,029
Put some of this on your face.

651
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:07,669
The sun is strong today.

652
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:12,248
Planting day has always
been important here.

653
00:34:12,288 --> 00:34:14,087
It brings everyone together.

654
00:34:14,158 --> 00:34:16,755
Somehow it feels right
to see it through.

655
00:34:45,193 --> 00:34:46,822
Oh, here's one for you.

656
00:34:46,863 --> 00:34:47,922
Thanks.

657
00:34:47,966 --> 00:34:49,731
Molly, take that
from the bottom.

658
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:51,103
Thank you.

659
00:34:54,915 --> 00:34:56,680
Thank you.

660
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,570
The status report
you asked for, sir.

661
00:35:09,848 --> 00:35:11,613
The repairs are finished.

662
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:14,088
The <i>Defiant's</i> ready
to leave orbit.

663
00:35:14,124 --> 00:35:15,684
Aren't you going to help?

664
00:35:15,727 --> 00:35:17,891
I'm busy.

665
00:35:17,931 --> 00:35:18,990
You don't look busy.

666
00:35:21,507 --> 00:35:23,443
She's an O'Brien, all right.

667
00:35:23,477 --> 00:35:25,470
Better get to it, Chief.

668
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,594
You said there was
an enemy for us to fight.

669
00:35:49,634 --> 00:35:51,695
They are attempting
to plant their fields

670
00:35:51,739 --> 00:35:53,333
before the sun sets.

671
00:35:53,376 --> 00:35:55,403
Time is their enemy.

672
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:57,975
We should help them defeat it.

673
00:36:00,693 --> 00:36:02,390
Bring the others.

674
00:36:22,908 --> 00:36:24,537
Oh, great.

675
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:31,047
You know...

676
00:36:31,092 --> 00:36:32,686
I have a little girl
named Molly, too.

677
00:36:32,729 --> 00:36:33,697
Really?

678
00:36:33,731 --> 00:36:34,699
Mm-hmm.

679
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:35,793
Can I meet her?

680
00:36:37,307 --> 00:36:39,038
We'll see.

681
00:36:39,077 --> 00:36:42,642
By summer, this plant
will be taller than you.

682
00:36:42,685 --> 00:36:44,712
After the harvest,
I'll help my mother

683
00:36:44,756 --> 00:36:46,089
make gelm bread with it.

684
00:36:47,662 --> 00:36:49,598
Molly.

685
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:11,340
Something wrong?

686
00:37:12,484 --> 00:37:13,885
We can't do it.

687
00:37:13,919 --> 00:37:15,218
What?

688
00:37:15,256 --> 00:37:18,023
We can't let these people die.

689
00:37:22,004 --> 00:37:23,871
You're it.

690
00:37:33,028 --> 00:37:35,693
The navigational logs
from the original crash...

691
00:37:35,735 --> 00:37:37,637
download them
into the ship's autopilot

692
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,198
and it'll match
the original trajectory.

693
00:37:39,242 --> 00:37:41,509
That should send
the <i>Defiant</i> back

694
00:37:41,548 --> 00:37:43,678
to the right point in time.

695
00:37:45,622 --> 00:37:47,558
I don't know...

696
00:37:47,594 --> 00:37:50,122
how to thank you
for what you're doing.

697
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:51,863
We'd better go, Benjamin.

698
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:53,566
There isn't much time.

699
00:38:17,292 --> 00:38:18,351
You can't do this.

700
00:38:18,395 --> 00:38:19,590
Please don't make this
any harder

701
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:20,599
than it already is.

702
00:38:20,633 --> 00:38:22,227
You have to go home, Nerys...
you have to.

703
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,363
This isn't about me.

704
00:38:23,439 --> 00:38:25,842
This is about the 8,000
people down on that planet

705
00:38:25,878 --> 00:38:27,347
their children
and their grandchildren.

706
00:38:27,382 --> 00:38:29,079
What about the children
who'll never be born

707
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,748
because the <i>Defiant</i>
doesn't return to DS9?

708
00:38:30,789 --> 00:38:32,383
They don't exist yet.

709
00:38:32,459 --> 00:38:33,894
These people do.

710
00:38:33,929 --> 00:38:35,990
Nerys, just tell me one thing.

711
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:39,597
If you'd known
how I felt about you

712
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:42,876
if I'd said
something years ago

713
00:38:42,915 --> 00:38:45,854
do you think things might
have been different?

714
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:48,660
Maybe.

715
00:39:10,777 --> 00:39:12,542
Has everyone had a chance

716
00:39:12,581 --> 00:39:14,984
to record a message
to their families?

717
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,887
I've downloaded the recordings
into a class-4 probe.

718
00:39:16,923 --> 00:39:19,224
It'll start transmitting
a location signal

719
00:39:19,262 --> 00:39:21,129
as soon as it
clears the barrier.

720
00:39:26,612 --> 00:39:28,605
Launch the probe, Chief.

721
00:39:31,823 --> 00:39:33,588
It's time.

722
00:39:33,627 --> 00:39:36,794
Transfer helm control
to autopilot.

723
00:39:40,976 --> 00:39:42,969
Autopilot engaged.

724
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:44,677
Raise shields.

725
00:39:44,718 --> 00:39:46,187
Aye, sir.

726
00:39:49,662 --> 00:39:52,065
We are breaking orbit.

727
00:39:52,101 --> 00:39:54,732
Coming around to 42 mark seven.

728
00:39:54,773 --> 00:39:58,372
I'm picking up
an unusual temporal signature.

729
00:39:58,415 --> 00:39:59,714
It's the anomaly.

730
00:39:59,751 --> 00:40:01,482
We're headed straight for it.

731
00:40:09,706 --> 00:40:12,269
Ten seconds to impact.

732
00:40:12,311 --> 00:40:13,279
Eight...

733
00:40:13,314 --> 00:40:14,282
seven...

734
00:40:14,316 --> 00:40:16,218
six...

735
00:40:16,254 --> 00:40:17,553
five...

736
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,583
We're veering away
from the anomaly.

737
00:40:21,598 --> 00:40:23,865
Try to override the autopilot.

738
00:40:23,904 --> 00:40:25,430
I can't.

739
00:40:25,474 --> 00:40:27,273
We're clearing the barrier.

740
00:40:37,366 --> 00:40:39,599
What happened?

741
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:41,232
Someone changed our flight plan.

742
00:40:43,614 --> 00:40:44,947
It wasn't me.

743
00:40:46,688 --> 00:40:47,952
Scan the surface.

744
00:40:50,562 --> 00:40:52,395
No sign of the settlement...

745
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:55,873
or the inhabitants.

746
00:40:55,908 --> 00:40:57,400
Everything's gone.

747
00:41:06,999 --> 00:41:08,491
Whoever changed our flight plan

748
00:41:08,536 --> 00:41:10,506
knew their way around
the computer system.

749
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,407
They bypassed
our security protocols

750
00:41:12,443 --> 00:41:13,742
without leaving a trace.

751
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,513
It must have been
someone from the crew.

752
00:41:16,553 --> 00:41:19,081
Or someone who used to be.

753
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:20,424
Yedrin?

754
00:41:20,461 --> 00:41:22,090
Hmm.

755
00:41:22,132 --> 00:41:24,433
But all he cared about
was the settlement.

756
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,440
What could have
changed his mind?

757
00:41:26,474 --> 00:41:28,103
Seeing us again.

758
00:41:28,145 --> 00:41:30,115
Perhaps he decided

759
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,644
he couldn't let us
go through with it.

760
00:41:36,663 --> 00:41:39,636
Everyone we met...

761
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,264
they never existed.

762
00:41:42,844 --> 00:41:45,475
They existed.

763
00:41:45,516 --> 00:41:50,289
As long as we remember them...
they always will.

764
00:42:04,344 --> 00:42:06,440
Come in.

765
00:42:12,629 --> 00:42:13,790
Odo.

766
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,813
There's something
you should know.

767
00:42:20,846 --> 00:42:25,482
The other Odo,
the one from the planet...

768
00:42:25,523 --> 00:42:28,324
came to Sick Bay
before he left the ship.

769
00:42:28,363 --> 00:42:30,834
Oh?

770
00:42:30,868 --> 00:42:32,701
He linked with me.

771
00:42:38,886 --> 00:42:43,385
Now... I know everything
that happened.

772
00:42:47,405 --> 00:42:51,140
The, uh... other day,
when I told you

773
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,150
about Shakaar and... me

774
00:42:53,184 --> 00:42:56,214
not seeing each other
anymore...

775
00:42:58,262 --> 00:43:00,232
you seemed so uncomfortable.

776
00:43:00,267 --> 00:43:02,704
I had come to accept the fact

777
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:05,210
that you were involved
with someone else.

778
00:43:07,549 --> 00:43:10,579
Then suddenly
everything changed.

779
00:43:10,622 --> 00:43:14,393
I don't know what to say.

780
00:43:14,465 --> 00:43:18,030
I'm still trying
to sort everything out.

781
00:43:18,072 --> 00:43:19,564
So am I.

782
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:25,281
I think we both need some time.

783
00:43:29,931 --> 00:43:33,702
There's something else the
other Odo wanted you to know.

784
00:43:36,212 --> 00:43:40,517
He was responsible for changing
the <i>Defiant's</i> flight plan.

785
00:43:45,633 --> 00:43:46,966
Why?

786
00:43:47,003 --> 00:43:50,499
So that you
wouldn't have to die.

787
00:43:52,648 --> 00:43:54,584
I can't believe it.

788
00:43:56,123 --> 00:43:58,594
8,000 people.

789
00:43:58,628 --> 00:44:00,724
He did it for you, Nerys.

790
00:44:00,766 --> 00:44:02,395
He loved you.

791
00:44:02,436 --> 00:44:04,372
That makes it right?!

792
00:44:06,378 --> 00:44:07,711
I don't know.

793
00:44:10,053 --> 00:44:11,716
He thought so.

794
00:44:16,969 --> 00:44:18,962
I'll see you in the morning.
