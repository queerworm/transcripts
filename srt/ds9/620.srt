(<i> applause</i> )

20
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:31,759
Thank you.

21
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,343
Hey, it's been 400 years

22
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,596
but that little number
still works for me.

23
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:36,764
(<i> audience laughing</i> )

24
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:38,097
Isn't he
terrific?

25
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,683
I prefer
Klingon opera.

26
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,060
Come on, I'll
introduce you.

27
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,310
To a hologram?

28
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,479
Uh, Doctor, is this
really necessary?

29
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,025
Trust me. He's no
ordinary hologram.

30
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,568
BASHIR: Vic.

31
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:51,779
You're terrific,

32
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:52,738
great.

33
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:53,655
Thanks, Doc.

34
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,698
O'BRIEN:
Wonderful.

35
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:55,783
DAX:
Very nice.

36
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,242
I know what you're thinking--

37
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,036
he has pretty sweet pipes
for a light bulb.

38
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,287
Light bulb?

39
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,789
That's what I am, right?

40
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,206
A collection of photons

41
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,166
and force fields--
you know, your basic heuristic

42
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,752
fully interactive hologram.

43
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:08,462
He knows he's a hologram?

44
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,089
Felix designed him
that way.

45
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:12,340
Thought it would give him
the right attitude for the era.

46
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,884
If you're going to
work Vegas in the '60s

47
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,385
you better know the score

48
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,762
otherwise, you're
going to look like a Clyde.

49
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,221
A Clyde?

50
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,347
A Harvey, you know.

51
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:21,809
Harvey?

52
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:22,726
A square.

53
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,896
You know what
a square is, right?

54
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:28,857
It's one side of a cube.

55
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,400
Well, I guess
that answers my question.

56
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,069
Where are
your manners, Julian?

57
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,654
Aren't you going to introduce me
to your entourage?

58
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,072
I am so sorry.

59
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,531
Commanders Dax
and Worf,

60
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,533
this is
Vic Fontaine.

61
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,743
How long you kids
been married?

62
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,913
How did you know
we were married?

63
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,790
When you sing
in as many joints as I have

64
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,583
you become a student
of the human heart.

65
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,087
Don't beat yourself up, pally.

66
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,672
Just because you miss
your wife doesn't mean

67
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,881
you've gone blind.

68
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,717
What's that supposed to mean?

69
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,969
It means there are a lot

70
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,345
of very attractive ladies
in the room

71
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,596
and it's all right
to look at them

72
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,848
as long as you don't touch.

73
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,018
He's good.

74
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,228
And as for you two...

75
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,065
Yes?

76
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,734
Never mind.
Forget I brought it up.

77
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,569
You have time
for another song?

78
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,864
Oh, no, no.
We've got to split, Vic.

79
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,366
Well, you know
where to find me.

80
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,746
By the way, this is
a high-class joint.

81
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,623
That means coat and ties
for the gents

82
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,000
dresses for the ladies.

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,502
You guys look
like a trapeze act.

84
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,672
Catch you
later, baby.

85
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,261
Come on, Julian--

86
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,346
you told him about Keiko.

87
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,723
I didn't say a word.

88
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,349
(<i> chuckling</i> )

89
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,519
So, why don't we all meet here
tomorrow night at 2100?

90
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,396
We can listen to
Vic's whole set

91
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,065
then maybe hit
the casinos

92
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,357
play a little blackjack,
roulette.

93
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,693
We'll be there.
Right?

94
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,820
I still prefer
Klingon operas.

95
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,030
Well, count me out.

96
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,698
I'm leaving for Bajor
in the morning.

97
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,158
Oh, that's right.
I forgot.

98
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,450
Say hi to Shakaar for me.

99
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,869
Sorry.

100
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,412
I forgot.

101
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,372
Pretend you didn't hear that.

102
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,874
She doesn't want
anyone to know

103
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,625
that she's visiting
the First Minister.

104
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,544
Business or pleasure?

105
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,295
Ah, you see what
you started?

106
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,798
I said I was sorry.

107
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,137
So...

108
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,722
what do you think?

109
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:24,973
About what?

110
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,307
About Vic.
Clever, isn't he?

111
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,768
Too clever.

112
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,310
I tell you,
I owe the man, Miles.

113
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,520
If it wasn't for him

114
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,022
I wouldn't be dating
Ensign Walker.

115
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,398
What are you
talking about?

116
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,234
She turned down
three dinner invitations.

117
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:36,484
I talked to Vic

118
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,862
he gave me a few pointers
and, uh, voila.

119
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,363
O'BRIEN:
Julian, are you telling me

120
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,157
that you discussed
your love life

121
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,867
with a hologram?

122
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,536
He's not an ordinary
hologram, Miles.

123
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,289
He knows about love,
life, women.

124
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,708
Three things you know
nothing about.

125
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,293
Now that's a little unfair.

126
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,045
Well, then why are
you asking advice

127
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,880
from a light bulb?

128
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,967
I don't know why
you're so surprised.

129
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,719
What did you expect
was going to happen?

130
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,470
I wasn't expecting anything.

131
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,181
I see.

132
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,432
How long has it been

133
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,768
since Shakaar and
Major Kira broke up?

134
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,811
I don't know.
About a year.

135
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,980
It's been<i> over</i> a year.

136
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,565
You've had plenty of time

137
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,026
to arrange a... "a merger"

138
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,320
with Kira, but in all
that time, have you

139
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,406
even tried to open
negotiations? No.

140
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,785
It's not that simple.

141
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:36,998
Odo, the woman waited a year
for you to make an offer--

142
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,666
any kind of offer.

143
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:42,337
Face it. You've had
plenty of opportunities

144
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,172
and you've let them
all slip away.

145
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,632
Who asked for your opinion?

146
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,008
You did.

147
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,635
I came here to talk
about a missing shipment

148
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,220
of groat clusters.

149
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,846
You're the one who started
talking about the Major.

150
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:52,806
You want my advice?

151
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:53,890
No.

152
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,350
Make it easy
on both of us.

153
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,517
Forget all about her.

154
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,229
Is that the best you can do?

155
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,982
I'd like to see someone
do better.

156
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,566
So would I.

157
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,068
You're not exactly

158
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,612
the most lovable person
in the galaxy.

159
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,030
You're not even

160
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,825
the most lovable person
in this sector

161
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,827
or on the station...

162
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,955
or even in this room.

163
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,790
(<i> soft chuckle</i> )

164
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:23,462
You are cold...
rigid, remote.

165
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,590
Can I leave now?

166
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,802
Please do.

167
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,181
Wait.

168
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:37,142
Odo... make
up your mind.

169
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:40,728
(<i> sighs</i> )

170
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,314
I need a favor from you.

171
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:51,114
It's about... Dr. Bashir's
new holosuite program.

172
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,456
(<i> sighs</i> )

173
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,876
You're up late, Doctor.

174
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,336
Yeah. Can't sleep.

175
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,921
Feeling a bit
tense, actually.

176
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,007
I've got just the thing.

177
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:13,178
One warp core breach...
coming right up.

178
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,432
A few sips of this...

179
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,187
and you'll be relaxed
for the next three days.

180
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,190
I'm not<i> that</i>
tense, Quark.

181
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,650
Look, I think
I'll just go up

182
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,860
to the holosuite
for a bit and--

183
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,195
Holosuite?

184
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,821
Yes. If you could hand
me my new program--

185
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,575
Uh, sorry, Doctor,
all the holosuites are in use.

186
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,784
At this hour?

187
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,870
It's been that kind of a night.

188
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,955
I'm afraid there won't
be one available

189
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,290
for the rest of the evening.

190
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,958
Oh, that's unfortunate.

191
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,960
Maybe I'll go
and wake up Miles...

192
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,962
play a little<i> tongo.</i>

193
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,389
VIC:
I remember back in...

194
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:00,225
must have been '58,
I was playing the Sands.

195
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,769
One night, Frank
and Dean dropped by.

196
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,855
We ended up taking over
one of the blackjack tables.

197
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,981
Between the three of us

198
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,733
we must've dropped
15 big ones

199
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,985
and believe me, back then,
that wasn't chump change.

200
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,779
So Frank goes over
to the pit boss--

201
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,739
what was his name? Uh--

202
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,491
Look, Mr. Fontaine...

203
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:17,784
Vic.

204
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:21,413
Vic... these stories
are all very interesting

205
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:25,417
but I didn't come here
to reminisce about your past.

206
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:29,921
Yesterday, when my friends
and I were here...

207
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,799
you seemed to know things.

208
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,551
I've been around the block
a couple times.

209
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,428
No, you seemed to know
specific things.

210
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:39,806
For instance,
Dax and Worf are married...

211
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,100
the Chief misses his wife.

212
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,518
You don't have to be
an Einstein

213
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,561
to clue into any of that.

214
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:49,816
At one point, you were
going to make an observation

215
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:53,694
about...
Major Kira and myself.

216
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,238
I thought about it

217
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,115
but I didn't want
to embarrass anyone, you know

218
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,326
give away any secrets.

219
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,286
Exactly what secrets
are you talking about?

220
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,913
Come on-- do I really have
to connect the dots?

221
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:07,875
You're crazy about the broad
but you're afraid
to do anything about it.

222
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,628
And she...
well, you know.

223
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,879
No. Go on.

224
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,881
It's the oldest story
in the book.

225
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,425
She thinks of you as a friend.

226
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,675
(<i> rueful laugh</i> )

227
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,637
I wouldn't call that
a secret.

228
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:21,139
<i>But</i> women have been known
to change their minds.

229
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,849
You just have to
give them a reason.

230
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,768
You make it sound so easy.

231
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,770
That's because
it's not that hard.

232
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,230
The girl already
likes you.

233
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,232
That means you're
halfway home.

234
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,735
Well... she's aware
of my feelings toward her

235
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,696
but the truth is,
she prefers Shakaar.

236
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,324
Who?

237
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,075
The First Minister of Bajor.

238
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,495
He's a leader, a hero,
a man with great charisma.

239
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,038
I don't care
if he's JFK.

240
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,456
It's not the other guy
you have to worry about.

241
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,999
It's you.

242
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,125
Me?

243
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,544
That's right.

244
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,629
I mean, for starters,
you've got to lose

245
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,589

247

Well, I mean, you've got

248
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,054
about as much personality
as an icicle.

249
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,264
Cool is one thing,
but you're frozen solid.

250
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,766
You think I have no emotions.

251
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,686
Oh, believe me, I do.

252
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:10,230
I just don't always show them.

253
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,981
And therein lies
the problem.

254
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,608
Come with me.

255
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,151

256
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,987
Look, pally, if you

the surface.

261
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,581
It's time to have some fun.

262
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:31,042
What does fun
have to do with Major Kira?

263
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,920
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

264
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,673
First... let's lose
those threads.

265
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,717
I mean, there's nothing

266
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:41,760
like a tuxedo to make you feel
like... a million bucks.

267
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,432
You mean...
something like this?

268
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,270
Very sharp.

269
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,606
After you.

270
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,857
Oh, uh... I don't sing.

271
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,401
Glad to hear it.

272
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,027
I don't need
the competition.

273
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,947
What I do need is someone to
handle the black and whites.

274
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,240

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,576
ten sevens in a row
at the craps table

276
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,119

277
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,537
So have a seat, my friend.

No. I-I don't play the piano.

00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:50,443
(<i> laughs</i> )

545
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:52,111
They feel good, too.

546
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,322
So do you.

547
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,909
(<i> sighs</i> )

548
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:00,994
I've been waiting
to hold you like this

549
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,620
for as long as I can remember.

550
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:05,082
We just met tonight.

551
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:06,708
I must have
a short memory.

552
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:07,667
You're funny.

553
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,711
Kind of like Victor Borge?

554
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,505
How'd you know?

555
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,345
Ah, I... I can't.

556
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,679
I can't do this.

557
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:20,598
Why not?

558
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:21,807
I'm sorry.

559
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:22,891
It has nothing
to do with you.

560
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,726
Vic? Vic?!

561
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:25,811
(<i> door opens</i> )

562
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:27,980
What's wrong?

563
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,815
This isn't working.

564
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:32,192
I thought you two were
getting along just fine.

565
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,527
Of course, we are.

566
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:35,571
You programmed her
to find me irresistible.

567
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:37,197
I could read her
a criminal activities report.

568
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,907
She'd think it was poetry.

569
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,826
Do you want me to reprogram
her-- make her play hard to get?

570
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,536
ODO:
No. She's nothing like Kira.

571
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:43,703
Who's Kira?

572
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,539
Of course,
she's not Kira.

573
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:46,540
She's a hologram.

574
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,707
A<i> what?</i>

575
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,460
Sweetheart, please,
stay out of this.

576
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,128
Do you know how difficult
it was for me

577
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:53,213
to get a holographic image
of Major Kira?

578
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,466
Lucky for you,
Julian used her image

579
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:56,758
in one of his spy programs--

580
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,385
though it did
take me an hour

581
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,137
to get rid
of the Russian accent.

582
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:02,097
Look, I appreciate
what you've done for me

583
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,475
but I'm afraid
it's all been in vain.

584
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,477
I may be Romeo
in the holosuite

585
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:07,769
but I know the first time

586
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,313
I see the real Kira

587
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:12,483
I'll turn back into
Nanook of the North.

588
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:14,985
At least you're starting
to talk the talk.

589
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:17,029
No, I was hoping for
a bit more than that.

590
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,280
Wait. Wait a minute.

591
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,697
You can't give up now.

592
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:21,325
I'm sorry,
but I am tired

593
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:23,910
of discussing my feelings
with a hologram.

594
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,003
You're a hologram, too?

595
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,141
KIRA: Odo,

596
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,351
hello.

597
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:48,644
Major.

598
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:51,355
Anything interesting
happen while I was gone?

599
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:52,481
Interesting?

600
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,567
No, no. Nothing at all.

601
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:57,277
As a matter of
fact, it's...

602
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,487
been rather dull.

603
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,406
I'm sorry to hear that.

604
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,659
Well, I, uh...

605
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,578
I'd better get
back to work.

606
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,643
Hey, doll face.

607
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:30,686
You asleep?

608
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,648
How the hell
did you get in here?

609
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:36,942
I'm performing next door
for Dax and Worf.

610
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,818
I'm between sets,
so I transferred my matrix

611
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:40,362
from that holosuite to this one.

612
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:41,530
Now, I don't have much time.

613
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,740
What do you want?

614
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,199
We have to talk.

615
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,242
About what?

616
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:46,993
Odo. What else?

617
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,412
Odo.

618
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:49,747
Come on, Major,
don't be coy.

619
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:51,624
We both know
he's nuts about you.

620
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:53,041
He told you that.

621
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,418
He tells me everything.

622
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:56,002
We've been spending
a lot of time together.

623
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:00,758
Odo... spending time
in a holosuite?

624
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:01,800
And loving it.

625
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,385
Uh, I'm sorry.

626
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:05,471
That's just not
the Odo that<i> I</i> know.

627
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,347
Which tells you what?

628
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:10,225
You don't know him
as well as you think you do.

629
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,770
He's not the same
stick-in-the-mud anymore.

630
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,354
That cat can swing.

631
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:17,483
Are we talking
about the same Odo?

632
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:18,776
The one and only.

633
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,193
But let me tell you

634
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,946
the only chick
he wants to swing with is you.

635
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,657
I take it that's a good thing.

636
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:27,075
It's love, baby.

637
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,619
Nothing better than that.

638
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,997
How did you get in here again?

639
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,791
Don't try to change the subject.

640
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,167
We're talking about you and Odo.

641
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,752
No, that's what you're
talking about.

642
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:37,836
I'm trying to meditate.

643
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,421
And I don't
mean to interrupt.

644
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:40,839
Good, then leave.

645
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,719
Talk about your cranky aliens.

646
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:47,596
You two really<i> are</i>

647
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:49,598
made for each other.

648
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,099
Which is why
you've got to come

649
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,518
to the holosuite tonight.

650
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,102
What for?

651
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,771
So you and Odo
can have dinner together.

652
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,648
If Odo wants
to have dinner with me

653
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:59,232
then why doesn't
he ask me himself?

654
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,610
Because I'm asking you for him

655
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,280
and neither one of us
will take no for an answer.

656
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:11,578
Well then I...
better say yes.

657
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,079
(<i> laughs</i> )

658
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,039
Crazy.

659
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,885
(<i> groans</i> )

660
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,846
VIC:
Odo? Can you hear me?

661
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:30,930
Vic?

662
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,141
What are you doing
on the com line?

663
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,560
I need to talk to you.

664
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,395
I want you to come
to the holosuite tonight.

665
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,772
Why?

666
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,274
I've done a complete overhaul
on the Lola hologram--

667
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,901
or should I say
the Kira hologram?

668
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,444
I'm telling you, Odo

669
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,321
you're going to think
she's the real thing.

670
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,532
She walks like Kira;
she talks like Kira.

671
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:50,617
Really?

672
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:54,037
How did you manage
to accomplish that?

673
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,539
I don't have time
to explain now.

674
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:56,749
I'll see you tonight, 9:00--

675
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:58,417
That's 2100 to you.

676
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,085
I know.

677
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,670
VIC: I'll see you then, pally.

678
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,347
I believe
you two know each other.

679
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,268
You look lovely.

680
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,144
Thank you.

681
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,773
So do you.

682
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:22,023
VIC:
Mademoiselle.

683
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,537
I'll be your server
this evening.

684
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:38,415
I'll try not
to spill anything.

685
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:42,085
To begin, a little
Dom Perignon, '55

686
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:45,338
and some
Oysters Rockefeller...

687
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,133
to be followed
by Caesar salad

688
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:51,845
chateaubriand
and cherries jubilee.

689
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:02,147
This is all
very interesting, but, uh...

690
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:07,193
don't you feel a little silly
being here in a holosuite?

691
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:13,283
A bit.

692
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:15,911
VIC:
Let me know when you're
ready for the salad.

693
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:27,130
<i>Bon appetit.</i>

694
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,632
It's French.

695
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,759
An Earth language.

696
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,970
It means "enjoy your meal."

697
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,763
I didn't know you spoke French.

698
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,306
I don't.

699
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:38,934
It's something
I learned from Vic.

700
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:41,102
French is, uh...

701
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,939
(<i> with French accent</i> ):
the language of love.

702
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,318
Vic's a fountain of information.

703
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:51,154
He's certainly a man
of many talents.

704
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,077
But...

705
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:01,414
we're really not here
to talk about Vic, are we?

706
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:06,211
I'm certainly not.

707
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,713
Hmm.

708
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,635
I always wondered
what this would be like.

709
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,598
The two of us having
dinner together?

710
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:21,059
It's certainly
not the way

711
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,936
I pictured it would be.

712
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:24,103
(<i> chuckling</i> )

713
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,480
It<i> is</i> a bit unusual.

714
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,486
Is something wrong?

715
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,321
You haven't touched
your food.

716
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,490
No, it-it looks
delicious.

717
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,867
I-I'm not hungry.

718
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:42,080
Truth is I'm
a little nervous.

719
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,541
You? Nervous?

720
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:46,001
A bit.

721
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:52,549
It<i> is</i> a first date, right?

722
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:54,342
Right.

723
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:00,557
Well, there's nothing wrong

Of enjoying yourself.

727

you enjoy is your work.

Oh, there's nothing wrong.

826
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:10,242
Have you ever had a moment
of pure clarity--

827
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:12,451
a moment where the truth
seems to just leap up

828
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,828
and grab you by the throat?

829
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,580
I bet this has
something to do

830
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,956
with your visit
with Shakaar.

831
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,457
Oh, this has nothing
to do with Shakaar.

832
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:21,002
Now, tell me, have you ever
had a moment like that?

833
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:22,461
One or two,
but, of course

834
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,172
that's over a span
of seven lifetimes.

835
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:26,799
Only two moments
of clarity

836
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,551
in seven lifetimes?

837
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:32,222
Nerys, total clarity
is a very rare thing.

838
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:33,390
I guess so.

839
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,974
And when it comes to you

840
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,601
it's important
that you act on it

841
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,187
because... believe me

842
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,813
confusion and doubt
will take over

843
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,148
before you know it.

844
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:46,945
You're absolutely right.

845
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:50,156
Makes perfect sense.

846
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,490
Don't tell me
you're having another

00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,784

00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,619

00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,046
Major, if you
don't mind

852
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:06,464
I'd like to forget
all about last night.

853

I don't think
that's a good idea.

854

We need to talk
about what happened.

855
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:11,386
Very well, then we can meet
in my office in an hour.

856
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:13,471
No, let's discuss it
over dinner.
Dinner?

857
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,348
Yeah, you can choose
the restaurant. Anywhere
but a holosuite.

858
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:17,683
What about Shakaar?
Do you think he'll approve?

859
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:20,270
Look, I don't care
whether he approves or not.

860
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,980
Shakaar and I are friends.

861

Now, are we going to have
dinner together or not?

866
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,573
And if we do,
then what?

867
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,367
I don't know, maybe we
could go dancing.

868
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:36,369
And after that,
I suppose you'll
expect me to kiss you.

869

Well, it's possible.
Well then, who
needs dinner?

Why don't I just
get it over with
