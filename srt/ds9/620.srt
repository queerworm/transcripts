1
00:00:06,708 --> 00:00:11,311
...so find yourself somebody

2
00:00:11,353 --> 00:00:14,327
Get yourself somebody

3
00:00:14,361 --> 00:00:20,036
You're nobody
till somebody loves you

4
00:00:21,246 --> 00:00:26,351
You're nobody
till somebody cares

5
00:00:28,364 --> 00:00:30,335
Now you may be king

6
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,170
You may possess

7
00:00:32,207 --> 00:00:35,238
The world and its gold

8
00:00:35,282 --> 00:00:38,951
Gold won't bring you happiness

9
00:00:38,991 --> 00:00:41,589
When you're growing old

10
00:00:41,632 --> 00:00:45,038
Now the world is still the same

11
00:00:45,074 --> 00:00:47,569
You'll never change it

12
00:00:48,917 --> 00:00:55,925
As sure as the stars shine above

13
00:00:55,969 --> 00:00:57,701
You're nobody

14
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:02,617
Till somebody loves you

15
00:01:02,653 --> 00:01:06,790
So find yourself somebody

16
00:01:06,831 --> 00:01:10,067
Get yourself somebody

17
00:01:10,106 --> 00:01:15,678
Find yourself somebody

18
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,391
Somebody to love.

19
00:01:32,263 --> 00:01:33,232
Thank you.

20
00:01:33,266 --> 00:01:34,758
Hey, it's been 400 years

21
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,002
but that little number
still works for me.

22
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:39,507
Isn't he terrific?

23
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:41,281
I prefer Klingon opera.

24
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,448
Come on, I'll introduce you.

25
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,686
To a hologram?

26
00:01:43,727 --> 00:01:45,926
Uh, Doctor, is this
really necessary?

27
00:01:45,965 --> 00:01:49,371
Trust me.
He's no ordinary hologram.

28
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:51,275
Vic.

29
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,544
You're terrific.

30
00:01:53,585 --> 00:01:54,554
Great.

31
00:01:54,588 --> 00:01:55,557
Thanks, Doc.

32
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:56,560
Wonderful.

33
00:01:56,593 --> 00:01:57,562
Very nice.

34
00:01:57,596 --> 00:01:58,724
I know what you're thinking...

35
00:01:58,766 --> 00:02:00,396
he has pretty sweet pipes
for a light bulb.

36
00:02:00,503 --> 00:02:01,733
Light bulb?

37
00:02:01,774 --> 00:02:03,209
That's what I am, right?

38
00:02:03,244 --> 00:02:04,645
A collection of photons

39
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:06,652
and force fields...
you know, your basic heuristic

40
00:02:06,686 --> 00:02:08,246
fully interactive hologram.

41
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,988
He knows he's a hologram?

42
00:02:10,028 --> 00:02:11,292
Felix designed him that way.

43
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,031
Thought it would give him
the right attitude for the era.

44
00:02:14,072 --> 00:02:15,541
If you're going to work Vegas
in the '60s

45
00:02:15,576 --> 00:02:16,602
you better know the score

46
00:02:16,645 --> 00:02:18,205
otherwise, you're
going to look like a Clyde.

47
00:02:18,249 --> 00:02:19,616
A Clyde?

48
00:02:19,653 --> 00:02:20,883
A Harvey, you know.

49
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:23,286
Harvey?

50
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:24,298
A square.

51
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:27,369
You know what a square is,
right?

52
00:02:27,406 --> 00:02:29,206
It's one side of a cube.

53
00:02:30,247 --> 00:02:32,241
Well, I guess
that answers my question.

54
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,379
Where are your manners, Julian?

55
00:02:33,422 --> 00:02:35,154
Aren't you going to introduce me
to your entourage?

56
00:02:35,193 --> 00:02:36,662
I am so sorry.

57
00:02:36,697 --> 00:02:38,098
Commanders Dax and Worf.

58
00:02:38,135 --> 00:02:39,969
This is Vic Fontaine.

59
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:41,441
How long you kids been married?

60
00:02:42,613 --> 00:02:44,277
How did you know
we were married?

61
00:02:44,316 --> 00:02:46,184
When you sing
in as many joints as I have

62
00:02:46,222 --> 00:02:48,318
you become a student
of the human heart.

63
00:02:49,364 --> 00:02:51,768
Don't beat yourself up, pally.

64
00:02:51,803 --> 00:02:53,272
Just because you miss
your wife doesn't mean

65
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:54,571
you've gone blind.

66
00:02:56,214 --> 00:02:57,240
What's that supposed to mean?

67
00:02:57,284 --> 00:02:58,275
It means there are a lot

68
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,846
of very attractive ladies
in the room

69
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,223
and it's all right
to look at them

70
00:03:01,261 --> 00:03:02,389
as long as you don't touch.

71
00:03:04,202 --> 00:03:05,637
He's good.

72
00:03:07,343 --> 00:03:08,812
And as for you two...

73
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,684
Yes?

74
00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:14,321
Never mind.
Forget I brought it up.

75
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,956
You have time for another song?

76
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:18,437
Oh, no, no.
We've got to split, Vic.

77
00:03:18,472 --> 00:03:20,944
Well, you know where to find me.

78
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:26,384
By the way,
this is a high-class joint.

79
00:03:26,426 --> 00:03:28,158
That means coat and ties
for the gents

80
00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:29,497
dresses for the ladies.

81
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:32,096
You guys look
like a trapeze act.

82
00:03:33,711 --> 00:03:35,409
Catch you later, baby.

83
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:41,689
Come on, Julian...

84
00:03:41,732 --> 00:03:42,792
you told him about Keiko.

85
00:03:42,835 --> 00:03:44,361
I didn't say a word.

86
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,214
So, why don't we all meet here
tomorrow night at 2100?

87
00:03:49,252 --> 00:03:51,120
We can listen to Vic's whole set

88
00:03:51,157 --> 00:03:52,558
then maybe hit the casinos

89
00:03:52,594 --> 00:03:54,086
play a little blackjack,
roulette.

90
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:56,365
We'll be there.
Right?

91
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:58,568
I still prefer Klingon operas.

92
00:03:58,643 --> 00:03:59,576
Well, count me out.

93
00:03:59,646 --> 00:04:01,206
I'm leaving for Bajor
in the morning.

94
00:04:01,249 --> 00:04:02,616
Oh, that's right.
I forgot.

95
00:04:02,654 --> 00:04:04,021
Say hi to Shakaar for me.

96
00:04:04,057 --> 00:04:05,492
Sorry.

97
00:04:05,527 --> 00:04:07,122
I forgot.

98
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:09,068
Pretend you didn't hear that.

99
00:04:09,104 --> 00:04:10,232
She doesn't want anyone to know

100
00:04:10,273 --> 00:04:12,210
that she's visiting
the First Minister.

101
00:04:12,245 --> 00:04:14,216
Business or pleasure?

102
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,742
Ah, you see what you started?

103
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:18,317
I said I was sorry.

104
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:23,566
So...

105
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:25,305
what do you think?

106
00:04:25,346 --> 00:04:26,542
About what?

107
00:04:26,582 --> 00:04:27,949
About Vic.
Clever, isn't he?

108
00:04:27,986 --> 00:04:29,353
Too clever.

109
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:30,984
I tell you,
I owe the man, Miles.

110
00:04:31,027 --> 00:04:31,996
If it wasn't for him

111
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,762
I wouldn't be dating
Ensign Walker.

112
00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:34,861
What are you talking about?

113
00:04:34,904 --> 00:04:37,103
She turned down
three dinner invitations.

114
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,203
I talked to Vic

115
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,740
he gave me a few pointers
and, uh, voila.

116
00:04:40,786 --> 00:04:42,312
Julian, are you telling me

117
00:04:42,356 --> 00:04:43,848
that you discussed
your love life

118
00:04:43,894 --> 00:04:45,295
with a hologram?

119
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:47,997
He's not an ordinary
hologram, Miles.

120
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,876
He knows about love,
life, women.

121
00:04:50,912 --> 00:04:53,441
Three things you know
nothing about.

122
00:04:53,486 --> 00:04:54,887
Now that's a little unfair.

123
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:56,620
Well, then why are
you asking advice

124
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,654
from a light bulb?

125
00:07:05,256 --> 00:07:07,455
I don't know
why you're so surprised.

126
00:07:07,496 --> 00:07:09,228
What did you expect
was going to happen?

127
00:07:09,267 --> 00:07:11,033
I wasn't expecting anything.

128
00:07:11,072 --> 00:07:12,736
I see.

129
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:13,971
How long has it been

130
00:07:14,013 --> 00:07:16,281
since Shakaar and Major Kira
broke up?

131
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,587
I don't know.
About a year.

132
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,755
It's been over a year.

133
00:07:20,864 --> 00:07:22,299
You've had plenty of time

134
00:07:22,335 --> 00:07:24,899
to arrange a... a merger

135
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:27,209
with Kira,
but in all that time, have you

136
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:29,446
even tried to open negotiations?
No.

137
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,687
It's not that simple.

138
00:07:33,731 --> 00:07:38,938
Odo, the woman waited a year
for you to make an offer...

139
00:07:38,977 --> 00:07:40,503
any kind of offer.

140
00:07:40,549 --> 00:07:44,321
Face it. You've had
plenty of opportunities

141
00:07:44,358 --> 00:07:46,090
and you've let them
all slip away.

142
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,497
Who asked for your opinion?

143
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:48,502
You did.

144
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:50,769
I came here to talk
about a missing shipment

145
00:07:50,808 --> 00:07:51,834
of groat clusters.

146
00:07:51,878 --> 00:07:53,849
You're the one who started
talking about the Major.

147
00:07:53,883 --> 00:07:55,011
You want my advice?

148
00:07:55,053 --> 00:07:56,022
No.

149
00:07:56,055 --> 00:07:57,251
Make it easy on both of us.

150
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,453
Forget all about her.

151
00:07:58,495 --> 00:08:01,195
Is that the best you can do?

152
00:08:01,236 --> 00:08:03,800
I'd like to see someone
do better.

153
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:05,401
So would I.

154
00:08:05,446 --> 00:08:06,938
You're not exactly

155
00:08:06,984 --> 00:08:09,616
the most lovable person
in the galaxy.

156
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:10,921
You're not even

157
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,558
the most lovable person
in this sector

158
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,764
or on the station...

159
00:08:15,807 --> 00:08:18,872
or even in this room.

160
00:08:20,586 --> 00:08:25,531
You are cold... rigid, remote.

161
00:08:28,005 --> 00:08:29,635
Can I leave now?

162
00:08:31,547 --> 00:08:32,811
Please do.

163
00:08:35,157 --> 00:08:36,183
Wait.

164
00:08:36,227 --> 00:08:39,292
Odo... make up your mind.

165
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,444
I need a favor from you.

166
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:53,103
It's about... Dr. Bashir's
new holosuite program.

167
00:09:03,463 --> 00:09:04,898
You're up late, Doctor.

168
00:09:04,968 --> 00:09:06,267
Yeah. Can't sleep.

169
00:09:06,305 --> 00:09:08,903
Feeling a bit tense, actually.

170
00:09:08,978 --> 00:09:10,812
I've got just the thing.

171
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:15,316
One warp core breach...
coming right up.

172
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,528
A few sips of this...

173
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,344
and you'll be relaxed
for the next three days.

174
00:09:25,587 --> 00:09:27,524
I'm not that tense, Quark.

175
00:09:28,662 --> 00:09:29,631
Look, I think I'll just go up

176
00:09:29,665 --> 00:09:30,895
to the holosuite for a bit
and, uh...

177
00:09:30,935 --> 00:09:31,961
Holosuite?

178
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,769
Yes. If you could hand me
my new program...

179
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:37,683
Uh, sorry, Doctor,
all the holosuites are in use.

180
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:38,983
At this hour?

181
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:40,992
It's been that kind of a night.

182
00:09:41,094 --> 00:09:43,088
I'm afraid there won't
be one available

183
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:44,433
for the rest of the evening.

184
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,100
Oh, that's unfortunate.

185
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:48,009
Maybe I'll go
and wake up Miles...

186
00:09:48,112 --> 00:09:50,174
play a little <i>tongo.</i>

187
00:09:57,771 --> 00:09:59,639
I remember back in...

188
00:09:59,676 --> 00:10:02,444
must have been '58,
I was playing the Sands.

189
00:10:02,483 --> 00:10:04,887
One night, Frank and Dean
dropped by.

190
00:10:04,923 --> 00:10:07,988
We ended up taking over
one of the blackjack tables.

191
00:10:08,031 --> 00:10:10,903
Between the three of us
we must've dropped 15 big ones

192
00:10:10,939 --> 00:10:13,343
and believe me, back then,
that wasn't chump change.

193
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:15,076
So Frank goes over
to the pit boss...

194
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,053
what was his name? Uh...

195
00:10:17,088 --> 00:10:18,648
Look, Mr. Fontaine...

196
00:10:18,692 --> 00:10:19,786
Vic.

197
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:23,668
Vic... these stories
are all very interesting

198
00:10:23,705 --> 00:10:27,647
but I didn't come here
to reminisce about your past.

199
00:10:27,682 --> 00:10:32,217
Yesterday, when my friends
and I were here...

200
00:10:32,261 --> 00:10:35,029
you seemed to know things.

201
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,765
I've been around the block
a couple times.

202
00:10:36,805 --> 00:10:38,673
No, you seemed to know
specific things.

203
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,946
For instance,
Dax and Worf are married...

204
00:10:41,986 --> 00:10:44,322
the Chief misses his wife.

205
00:10:44,358 --> 00:10:45,759
You don't have to be
an Einstein

206
00:10:45,796 --> 00:10:46,958
to clue into any of that.

207
00:10:48,603 --> 00:10:52,170
At one point, you were
going to make an observation

208
00:10:52,246 --> 00:10:55,983
about...
Major Kira and myself.

209
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,457
I thought about it

210
00:10:57,492 --> 00:10:59,463
but I didn't want
to embarrass anyone, you know

211
00:10:59,498 --> 00:11:01,560
give away any secrets.

212
00:11:01,604 --> 00:11:03,575
Exactly what secrets
are you talking about?

213
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:06,309
Come on... do I really have
to connect the dots?

214
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:07,477
You're crazy about the broad

215
00:11:07,518 --> 00:11:10,082
but you're afraid to do anything
about it.

216
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,993
And she... well, you know.

217
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:14,265
No. Go on.

218
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,171
It's the oldest story
in the book.

219
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,676
She thinks of you as a friend.

220
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:20,715
I wouldn't call that a secret.

221
00:11:20,753 --> 00:11:23,317
But women have been known
to change their minds.

222
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,194
You just have
to give them a reason.

223
00:11:25,232 --> 00:11:28,104
You make it sound so easy.

224
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:30,167
That's because
it's not that hard.

225
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:31,646
The girl already likes you.

226
00:11:31,682 --> 00:11:33,380
That means you're halfway home.

227
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,953
Well... she's aware
of my feelings toward her

228
00:11:36,995 --> 00:11:40,094
but the truth is,
she prefers Shakaar.

229
00:11:40,136 --> 00:11:41,605
Who?

230
00:11:41,641 --> 00:11:43,236
The First Minister of Bajor.

231
00:11:43,312 --> 00:11:46,184
He's a leader, a hero,
a man with great charisma.

232
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:47,245
I don't care if he's JFK.

233
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,953
It's not the other guy
you have to worry about.

234
00:11:48,993 --> 00:11:50,360
It's you.

235
00:11:50,397 --> 00:11:51,798
Me?

236
00:11:51,834 --> 00:11:52,928
That's right.

237
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,964
I mean, for starters,
you've got to lose

238
00:11:55,008 --> 00:11:56,979
this whole <i>Nanook</i>
<i>of the North</i> thing.

239
00:11:57,013 --> 00:12:00,078
I... I-I don't understand.

240
00:12:00,122 --> 00:12:01,284
Well, I mean, you've got

241
00:12:01,325 --> 00:12:03,228
about as much personality
as an icicle.

242
00:12:03,296 --> 00:12:05,632
Cool is one thing,
but you're frozen solid.

243
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:07,971
You think I have no emotions.

244
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:09,946
Oh, believe me, I do.

245
00:12:09,981 --> 00:12:12,613
I just don't always show them.

246
00:12:12,654 --> 00:12:14,352
And therein lies the problem.

247
00:12:14,392 --> 00:12:15,827
Come with me.

248
00:12:15,862 --> 00:12:17,263
Where to?

249
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:20,239
Look, pally, if you
want to win the girl

250
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:22,075
we got to thaw you
out a little bit.

251
00:12:22,112 --> 00:12:24,276
You know, turn up the heat...

252
00:12:24,351 --> 00:12:26,117
get those emotions
you claim to have

253
00:12:26,156 --> 00:12:27,682
bubbling to the surface.

254
00:12:27,726 --> 00:12:30,062
It's time to have some fun.

255
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:33,505
What does fun
have to do with Major Kira?

256
00:12:34,544 --> 00:12:36,242
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

257
00:12:36,282 --> 00:12:39,154
First...
let's lose those threads.

258
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,161
I mean, there's nothing

259
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:44,260
like a tuxedo to make you feel
like... a million bucks.

260
00:12:44,303 --> 00:12:47,938
You mean...
something like this?

261
00:12:51,054 --> 00:12:52,649
Very sharp.

262
00:12:52,725 --> 00:12:53,887
After you.

263
00:12:54,998 --> 00:12:57,300
Oh, uh... I don't sing.

264
00:12:57,337 --> 00:12:58,806
Glad to hear it.

265
00:12:58,841 --> 00:13:00,276
I don't need the competition.

266
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,514
What I do need is someone
to handle the black and whites.

267
00:13:03,554 --> 00:13:04,648
My piano player just threw

268
00:13:04,689 --> 00:13:06,853
ten sevens in a row
at the craps table

269
00:13:06,895 --> 00:13:08,490
and took off for Reno.

270
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:10,002
So have a seat, my friend.

271
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,809
Crowd's getting restless.

272
00:13:12,844 --> 00:13:13,813
What crowd?

273
00:13:13,846 --> 00:13:15,612
That one.

274
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,771
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

275
00:13:23,806 --> 00:13:26,278
I'm Vic Fontaine.

276
00:13:28,552 --> 00:13:30,922
And tonight
is going to be a gas.

277
00:13:32,863 --> 00:13:33,832
Hit it, Nanook.

278
00:13:33,865 --> 00:13:35,733
No. I-I don't play the piano.

279
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,468
You want to bet?

280
00:13:41,218 --> 00:13:42,414
Stay with me, pally.

281
00:13:43,724 --> 00:13:44,988
Well, you don't need me.

282
00:13:45,028 --> 00:13:46,692
The piano's doing all the work.

283
00:13:46,732 --> 00:13:48,669
That's not the point.
You've got to sell it.

284
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:50,698
Style, baby, style.
Make 'em believe.

285
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:52,406
Style.

286
00:13:54,152 --> 00:13:56,180
Come fly with me

287
00:13:56,223 --> 00:14:00,097
Come fly, let's fly away

288
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:05,737
If you can use some exotic booze

289
00:14:05,781 --> 00:14:09,279
There's a bar in far Bombay

290
00:14:09,324 --> 00:14:11,420
Come fly with me

291
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:14,628
Come fly, let's fly away

292
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:18,408
Come fly with me

293
00:14:18,447 --> 00:14:20,976
Let's take off to Peru

294
00:14:23,628 --> 00:14:28,299
In llama land,
there's a one-man band

295
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,781
And he'll toot his flute for you

296
00:14:31,816 --> 00:14:33,787
Come fly with me

297
00:14:33,821 --> 00:14:35,883
Let's take off in the blue

298
00:14:37,764 --> 00:14:40,670
If I get you up there

299
00:14:40,705 --> 00:14:45,946
Where the air is rarefied

300
00:14:47,088 --> 00:14:51,030
We'll just glide

301
00:14:51,065 --> 00:14:53,333
Starry eyed

302
00:14:53,371 --> 00:14:55,935
Once I get you up there

303
00:14:55,978 --> 00:15:01,185
I'll be holding you so near

304
00:15:01,226 --> 00:15:05,066
You may hear

305
00:15:05,102 --> 00:15:08,635
Angels cheer
'cause we're together

306
00:15:08,678 --> 00:15:10,774
Weather-wise

307
00:15:10,817 --> 00:15:13,916
It's such a lovely day

308
00:15:15,663 --> 00:15:17,793
You just say the words

309
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:19,669
And we'll beat the birds

310
00:15:19,706 --> 00:15:23,409
Down to Acapulco Bay

311
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:28,326
It's perfect
for a flying honeymoon

312
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:30,356
They say

313
00:15:30,401 --> 00:15:32,565
Come fly with me

314
00:15:32,674 --> 00:15:36,707
Let's fly, let's fly away

315
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,590
Once I get you up there

316
00:15:40,628 --> 00:15:46,075
Where the air is rarefied

317
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:49,378
We'll just glide

318
00:15:50,386 --> 00:15:52,289
Starry eyed

319
00:15:52,324 --> 00:15:55,196
Once I get you up there

320
00:15:55,232 --> 00:16:01,613
I'll be holding you so near

321
00:16:01,648 --> 00:16:03,916
You may hear

322
00:16:03,955 --> 00:16:08,592
Angels cheer
'cause we're together

323
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:09,897
Weather-wise

324
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:13,503
It's such a lovely day

325
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,219
Just say the words

326
00:16:17,256 --> 00:16:19,386
And we'll beat the birds

327
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:22,996
Down to Acapulco Bay

328
00:16:23,037 --> 00:16:27,744
It's perfect
for a flying honeymoon

329
00:16:27,783 --> 00:16:30,255
They say

330
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,284
Come fly with me

331
00:16:32,328 --> 00:16:37,273
Let's fly, let's fly away

332
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:39,837
Come fly with me

333
00:16:39,881 --> 00:16:44,222
Pack up, let's fly away.

334
00:17:00,535 --> 00:17:02,563
Whoo!

335
00:17:04,278 --> 00:17:06,580
No, it's... it's nothing.

336
00:17:07,987 --> 00:17:09,115
Cool!

337
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:18,670
Bottoms up.

338
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:20,044
Oh, I don't drink.

339
00:17:20,116 --> 00:17:21,278
Why am I not surprised?

340
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:22,287
It's not real booze.

341
00:17:22,321 --> 00:17:23,381
You're in a holosuite, remember?

342
00:17:23,424 --> 00:17:24,393
Ah.

343
00:17:24,426 --> 00:17:26,556
So, how'd you like
being in the spotlight?

344
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,661
Very bright.

345
00:17:28,704 --> 00:17:30,071
That's all you got to say?

346
00:17:30,142 --> 00:17:33,173
Well, the lights kept me
from seeing the audience.

347
00:17:33,216 --> 00:17:35,586
I suppose that's why
I wasn't nervous.

348
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:37,217
Nothing to be nervous about.

349
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,855
You were too busy having fun.

350
00:17:40,235 --> 00:17:41,602
Well, I suppose I was.

351
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:48,619
I'm just grateful none
of my friends saw me.

352
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:50,388
There you go...
tensing up again.

353
00:17:50,427 --> 00:17:51,589
Look at you.

354
00:17:51,631 --> 00:17:54,001
I mean, you're standing there
like a statue.

355
00:17:54,037 --> 00:17:55,028
I mean, the only things

356
00:17:55,072 --> 00:17:56,507
you're going to attract
are pigeons.

357
00:17:57,546 --> 00:17:58,879
Sit down.

358
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:01,785
Relax.

359
00:18:01,823 --> 00:18:03,953
Take a couple of deep breaths.

360
00:18:03,996 --> 00:18:04,965
You do that

361
00:18:04,998 --> 00:18:07,094
and everything you want
will come to you.

362
00:18:07,138 --> 00:18:08,539
That's all it takes?

363
00:18:08,575 --> 00:18:10,205
Try it.

364
00:18:10,246 --> 00:18:11,237
Go on.

365
00:18:26,254 --> 00:18:27,484
See?

366
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,958
Are you expecting someone?

367
00:18:28,995 --> 00:18:30,328
Let's find out.

368
00:18:35,378 --> 00:18:36,847
Surprise!

369
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:38,180
Well, for crying out
loud, what are you

370
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:39,813
two lovely ladies doing here?

371
00:18:39,856 --> 00:18:41,793
You invited us, remember?

372
00:18:41,827 --> 00:18:43,798
Oh, that's right.
Come on in.

373
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:45,632
Odo, we've got company.

374
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:48,645
Look, it's the piano player.

375
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:51,551
We saw you perform tonight.

376
00:18:51,586 --> 00:18:53,284
Melissa thinks you're adorable.

377
00:18:54,393 --> 00:18:57,629
Would you mind if I
looked at your hands?

378
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,639
Show her your hands.

379
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,157
I knew it.
They're so artistic.

380
00:19:07,194 --> 00:19:09,324
You know, I once played
on the same bill

381
00:19:09,366 --> 00:19:10,733
with Liberace.

382
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:13,105
He has the sweetest dimples.

383
00:19:13,142 --> 00:19:14,942
Are you classically trained?

384
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,540
No, actually, uh...

385
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:21,155
Vic taught me everything I know.

386
00:19:21,196 --> 00:19:22,222
Is he a good student?

387
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,963
Head of his class.

388
00:19:24,003 --> 00:19:26,703
Maybe I can help you
get your diploma.

389
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,853
All right, ladies,
the night is young

390
00:19:30,888 --> 00:19:33,452
and I have a table waiting
for us at the Dunes.

391
00:19:33,495 --> 00:19:35,990
We're going to see Shecky.

392
00:19:36,035 --> 00:19:38,234
Shecky.

393
00:19:38,274 --> 00:19:39,368
Shecky who?

394
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,678
Oh, you didn't tell me
he had a sense of humor.

395
00:19:41,716 --> 00:19:42,685
He plays the piano

396
00:19:42,718 --> 00:19:44,278
and he's funny.

397
00:19:44,356 --> 00:19:46,624
Kind of like Victor Borge.

398
00:19:46,663 --> 00:19:48,293
Who?

399
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,303
I think I'm in love.

400
00:19:50,338 --> 00:19:51,671
After you, ladies.

401
00:19:56,454 --> 00:19:57,650
Uh, I-I don't think...

402
00:19:57,691 --> 00:19:59,160
What are you worried about?

403
00:19:59,195 --> 00:20:01,599
Melissa's a very nice girl.

404
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:02,934
Oh, no, I'm sure she is.

405
00:20:02,972 --> 00:20:04,738
It's just... she's not Kira.

406
00:20:04,776 --> 00:20:06,109
Tell me something.

407
00:20:06,146 --> 00:20:08,117
How do you get to Carnegie Hall?

408
00:20:08,151 --> 00:20:09,120
I have no idea.

409
00:20:09,154 --> 00:20:10,954
Practice, practice, practice.

410
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:11,961
Get it?

411
00:20:11,995 --> 00:20:13,123
No.

412
00:20:13,164 --> 00:20:15,135
Think of this evening
as a trial run.

413
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:17,140
Trust me.
You're going to do great.

414
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,302
All right.

415
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,966
Captain, here's the report

416
00:20:29,005 --> 00:20:31,169
on that smuggling ring
you requested.

417
00:20:31,211 --> 00:20:33,979
Should I forward the information
to the Zevian authorities?

418
00:20:34,018 --> 00:20:35,146
I'll let you know in a minute.

419
00:20:55,407 --> 00:20:58,107
No, no, they

420
00:20:58,148 --> 00:21:02,387
Can't take that away from me

421
00:21:02,426 --> 00:21:06,893
The way your smile just beams...

422
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:10,311
Yes, Captain?

423
00:21:10,346 --> 00:21:12,317
Oh, don't stop on my account.

424
00:21:12,352 --> 00:21:13,844
Stop what?

425
00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:15,153
You were singing.

426
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:16,183
I was singing?

427
00:21:16,228 --> 00:21:17,994
No, no

428
00:21:18,033 --> 00:21:21,132
They can't take that
away from me.

429
00:21:21,175 --> 00:21:22,975
You're right.

430
00:21:23,013 --> 00:21:25,349
I was singing.

431
00:21:26,154 --> 00:21:27,714
They can't

432
00:21:27,758 --> 00:21:29,490
Take that

433
00:21:29,563 --> 00:21:33,403
Away from me

434
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:36,413
We may never

435
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:38,851
- Never meet again
- Never meet again

436
00:21:38,887 --> 00:21:40,117
On the

437
00:21:40,157 --> 00:21:42,391
- Bumpy road
- Bumpy road

438
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,424
- To love.
- To love.

439
00:21:47,075 --> 00:21:48,066
Lieutenant.

440
00:21:53,023 --> 00:21:53,992
Julian.

441
00:21:54,026 --> 00:21:55,017
Morning.

442
00:21:56,466 --> 00:21:58,266
Ops.

443
00:21:58,304 --> 00:21:59,934
I wonder...

444
00:21:59,975 --> 00:22:02,949
should you ask Kira
about Shakaar or should I?

445
00:22:02,982 --> 00:22:04,110
Why don't you do the honors?

446
00:22:04,152 --> 00:22:05,451
But you'll have to wait.

447
00:22:05,489 --> 00:22:07,460
She's staying on Bajor
for two more days.

448
00:22:07,495 --> 00:22:09,797
She and Shakaar must
be having a good time.

449
00:22:09,834 --> 00:22:10,962
That'd be my guess.

450
00:22:11,003 --> 00:22:12,131
Poor Odo.

451
00:22:12,173 --> 00:22:13,973
Odo? What's he got to do
with it?

452
00:22:15,415 --> 00:22:16,679
Not a thing.

453
00:22:18,189 --> 00:22:20,593
That's the problem.

454
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:29,609
Have fun.

455
00:22:45,393 --> 00:22:47,227
Thank you, thank you
for that kind applause.

456
00:22:47,264 --> 00:22:48,426
Keep clapping.

457
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:49,629
There's a fly buzzing the room

458
00:22:49,737 --> 00:22:51,571
and one of you
is bound to nail him.

459
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,459
Why the long face, buddy boy?

460
00:23:02,503 --> 00:23:03,995
You still haven't told me

461
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:06,741
what I'm supposed to do
about Kira and Shakaar.

462
00:23:06,781 --> 00:23:09,049
Shakaar?
Forget about that fink.

463
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:10,250
I'll bet he doesn't look

464
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:11,817
half as good in a tux as you do.

465
00:23:11,861 --> 00:23:14,595
What difference does that make?

466
00:23:14,635 --> 00:23:16,299
You've been coming here
every night for a week.

467
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,331
Have I steered you wrong?

468
00:23:18,345 --> 00:23:20,179
No.

469
00:23:20,217 --> 00:23:21,847
Then you trust your Uncle Vic.

470
00:23:22,857 --> 00:23:24,292
Ladies and gentlemen

471
00:23:24,327 --> 00:23:26,595
we have a very special surprise
for you tonight.

472
00:23:26,633 --> 00:23:28,797
If this babe doesn't raise
your temperature

473
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:30,605
you better check
the obituary column

474
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:32,375
because chances are
you're in it, pally.

475
00:23:33,684 --> 00:23:35,119
Let's have a nice, warm

476
00:23:35,156 --> 00:23:39,121
round of applause
for Miss Lola Chrystal.

477
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:53,269
Never know
how much I love you

478
00:23:53,303 --> 00:23:58,271
Never know how much I care

479
00:23:58,316 --> 00:24:02,281
When you put your arms
around me

480
00:24:02,326 --> 00:24:05,300
I get a feeling
that's so hard to bear

481
00:24:05,334 --> 00:24:07,134
You give me fever...

482
00:24:07,172 --> 00:24:08,802
Remind you of anyone?

483
00:24:08,842 --> 00:24:11,212
When you kiss me

484
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:15,316
Fever when you hold me tight

485
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,488
Fever

486
00:24:18,033 --> 00:24:19,663
In the morning

487
00:24:19,704 --> 00:24:23,145
Fever all through the night

488
00:24:24,516 --> 00:24:26,750
Everybody's

489
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:28,521
Got the fever

490
00:24:28,561 --> 00:24:30,498
That is something

491
00:24:30,532 --> 00:24:32,868
You all know

492
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:36,870
Fever isn't such a new thing

493
00:24:36,915 --> 00:24:39,889
Fever started long, long ago

494
00:24:49,816 --> 00:24:53,417
Sun lights up the daytime

495
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:58,028
Moon lights up the night

496
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:01,842
I light up
when you call my name

497
00:25:01,913 --> 00:25:05,046
'Cause you know
I'm gonna treat you right

498
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:06,922
You give me fever

499
00:25:09,099 --> 00:25:11,070
When you kiss me

500
00:25:11,104 --> 00:25:14,044
Fever, if you live,
you learn

501
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:16,477
Fever

502
00:25:17,621 --> 00:25:19,387
Till you sizzle

503
00:25:19,426 --> 00:25:23,334
What a lovely way to burn

504
00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:27,642
What a lovely way to burn

505
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:35,623
What a lovely way to burn.

506
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,559
Don't look now,
but I think she likes you.

507
00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:02,996
A toast.

508
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,668
As Georgie Jessel once said

509
00:26:06,709 --> 00:26:08,235
"To whatever makes you happy."

510
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:10,307
My thoughts exactly.

511
00:26:13,693 --> 00:26:15,596
I'm going to turn in.

512
00:26:15,631 --> 00:26:19,037
You two lovebirds
can live without me, I trust?

513
00:26:19,073 --> 00:26:20,372
Oh, we'll manage.

514
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:35,246
You have a beautiful voice.

515
00:26:36,385 --> 00:26:38,584
And you...

516
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,296
have beautiful hands.

517
00:26:47,414 --> 00:26:49,476
So I've been told.

518
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:55,600
They feel good, too.

519
00:26:57,105 --> 00:26:58,769
So do you.

520
00:27:02,353 --> 00:27:04,415
I've been waiting
to hold you like this

521
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,088
for as long as I can remember.

522
00:27:07,232 --> 00:27:08,428
We just met tonight.

523
00:27:08,468 --> 00:27:10,098
I must have a short memory.

524
00:27:10,139 --> 00:27:11,165
You're funny.

525
00:27:11,209 --> 00:27:13,203
Kind of like Victor Borge?

526
00:27:13,248 --> 00:27:15,014
How'd you know?

527
00:27:20,266 --> 00:27:21,735
Ah, I... I can't.

528
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,171
I can't do this.

529
00:27:23,207 --> 00:27:24,176
Why not?

530
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,179
I'm sorry.

531
00:27:25,212 --> 00:27:26,374
It has nothing to do with you.

532
00:27:26,415 --> 00:27:28,249
Vic? Vic?!

533
00:27:30,459 --> 00:27:31,485
What's wrong?

534
00:27:31,528 --> 00:27:33,088
This isn't working.

535
00:27:33,133 --> 00:27:35,867
I thought you two were
getting along just fine.

536
00:27:35,906 --> 00:27:36,932
Of course, we are.

537
00:27:36,976 --> 00:27:38,970
You programmed her
to find me irresistible.

538
00:27:39,014 --> 00:27:41,213
I could read her
a criminal activities report.

539
00:27:41,254 --> 00:27:42,223
She'd think it was poetry.

540
00:27:42,256 --> 00:27:43,418
Do you want me
to reprogram her...

541
00:27:43,459 --> 00:27:44,428
make her play hard to get?

542
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:45,954
No. She's nothing like Kira.

543
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:47,298
Who's Kira?

544
00:27:47,336 --> 00:27:48,931
Of course, she's not Kira.

545
00:27:48,974 --> 00:27:50,034
She's a hologram.

546
00:27:50,077 --> 00:27:51,239
A what?

547
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,875
Sweetheart, please,
stay out of this.

548
00:27:52,917 --> 00:27:54,615
Do you know how difficult
it was for me

549
00:27:54,655 --> 00:27:56,649
to get a holographic image
of Major Kira?

550
00:27:56,727 --> 00:27:58,857
Lucky for you,
Julian used her image

551
00:27:58,899 --> 00:28:00,334
in one of his spy programs...

552
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:01,839
though it did take me an hour

553
00:28:01,874 --> 00:28:03,538
to get rid
of the Russian accent.

554
00:28:03,578 --> 00:28:05,742
Look, I appreciate
what you've done for me

555
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,846
but I'm afraid
it's all been in vain.

556
00:28:07,889 --> 00:28:10,259
I may be Romeo in the holosuite

557
00:28:10,295 --> 00:28:12,767
but I know the first time
I see the real Kira

558
00:28:12,802 --> 00:28:15,867
I'll turn back into
Nanook of the North.

559
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:18,348
At least you're starting
to talk the talk.

560
00:28:18,383 --> 00:28:20,479
No, I was hoping
for a bit more than that.

561
00:28:20,522 --> 00:28:21,650
Wait. Wait a minute.

562
00:28:21,758 --> 00:28:23,159
You can't give up now.

563
00:28:23,196 --> 00:28:24,826
I'm sorry, but I am tired

564
00:28:24,866 --> 00:28:27,395
of discussing my feelings
with a hologram.

565
00:28:34,892 --> 00:28:36,487
You're a hologram, too?

566
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:49,656
Odo...

567
00:28:49,698 --> 00:28:50,667
hello.

568
00:28:50,701 --> 00:28:51,931
Major.

569
00:28:51,971 --> 00:28:54,945
Anything interesting
happen while I was gone?

570
00:28:54,979 --> 00:28:55,948
Interesting?

571
00:28:55,981 --> 00:28:58,111
No, no. Nothing at all.

572
00:28:58,154 --> 00:29:00,752
As a matter of fact, it's...

573
00:29:00,827 --> 00:29:01,955
been rather dull.

574
00:29:01,997 --> 00:29:03,991
I'm sorry to hear that.

575
00:29:05,673 --> 00:29:07,142
Well, I, uh...

576
00:29:07,177 --> 00:29:09,148
I'd better get back to work.

577
00:29:31,807 --> 00:29:33,299
Hey, doll face.

578
00:29:33,345 --> 00:29:34,336
You asleep?

579
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:38,049
How the hell
did you get in here?

580
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:40,494
I'm performing next door
for Dax and Worf.

581
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:42,466
I'm between sets,
so I transferred my matrix

582
00:29:42,501 --> 00:29:43,970
from that holosuite to this one.

583
00:29:44,006 --> 00:29:45,270
Now, I don't have much time.

584
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:46,403
What do you want?

585
00:29:46,445 --> 00:29:47,937
We have to talk.

586
00:29:47,982 --> 00:29:48,951
About what?

587
00:29:48,985 --> 00:29:50,751
Odo. What else?

588
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,020
Odo.

589
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,620
Come on, Major, don't be coy.

590
00:29:53,664 --> 00:29:55,362
We both know
he's nuts about you.

591
00:29:55,402 --> 00:29:56,769
He told you that.

592
00:29:56,805 --> 00:29:57,774
He tells me everything.

593
00:29:57,808 --> 00:29:59,642
We've been spending
a lot of time together.

594
00:30:00,648 --> 00:30:04,488
Odo... spending time
in a holosuite?

595
00:30:04,526 --> 00:30:05,620
And loving it.

596
00:30:05,661 --> 00:30:07,062
Uh, I'm sorry.

597
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:09,229
That's just not the Odo
that I know.

598
00:30:09,271 --> 00:30:11,071
Which tells you what?

599
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,981
You don't know him
as well as you think you do.

600
00:30:14,017 --> 00:30:16,512
He's not the same
stick-in-the-mud anymore.

601
00:30:16,557 --> 00:30:18,049
That cat can swing.

602
00:30:18,094 --> 00:30:21,262
Are we talking
about the same Odo?

603
00:30:21,302 --> 00:30:22,828
The one and only.

604
00:30:22,873 --> 00:30:23,899
But let me tell you

605
00:30:23,976 --> 00:30:26,505
the only chick
he wants to swing with is you.

606
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:28,486
I take it that's a good thing.

607
00:30:28,521 --> 00:30:30,789
It's love, baby.

608
00:30:30,827 --> 00:30:32,387
Nothing better than that.

609
00:30:33,734 --> 00:30:35,796
How did you get in here again?

610
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,470
Don't try to change the subject.

611
00:30:37,511 --> 00:30:39,175
We're talking about you and Odo.

612
00:30:39,215 --> 00:30:40,343
No, that's what you're
talking about.

613
00:30:40,385 --> 00:30:41,354
I'm trying to meditate.

614
00:30:41,388 --> 00:30:43,256
And I don't mean to interrupt.

615
00:30:43,293 --> 00:30:44,592
Good, then leave.

616
00:30:47,537 --> 00:30:49,508
Talk about your cranky aliens.

617
00:30:49,543 --> 00:30:53,280
You two really are
made for each other.

618
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:56,384
Which is why you've got to come
to the holosuite tonight.

619
00:30:56,427 --> 00:30:57,657
What for?

620
00:30:57,697 --> 00:30:59,691
So you and Odo
can have dinner together.

621
00:30:59,735 --> 00:31:01,365
If Odo wants
to have dinner with me

622
00:31:01,406 --> 00:31:03,036
then why doesn't
he ask me himself?

623
00:31:03,077 --> 00:31:05,207
Because I'm asking you for him

624
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:09,124
and neither one of us
will take no for an answer.

625
00:31:12,401 --> 00:31:15,432
Well then I... better say yes.

626
00:31:16,813 --> 00:31:17,941
Crazy.

627
00:31:30,818 --> 00:31:32,686
Odo? Can you hear me?

628
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,786
Vic?

629
00:31:34,829 --> 00:31:37,028
What are you doing
on the com line?

630
00:31:37,067 --> 00:31:38,331
I need to talk to you.

631
00:31:38,372 --> 00:31:40,343
I want you to come
to the holosuite tonight.

632
00:31:40,377 --> 00:31:42,541
Why?

633
00:31:42,582 --> 00:31:45,077
I've done a complete overhaul
on the Lola hologram...

634
00:31:45,122 --> 00:31:47,150
or should I say
the Kira hologram?

635
00:31:47,195 --> 00:31:48,221
I'm telling you, Odo

636
00:31:48,263 --> 00:31:50,166
you're going to think
she's the real thing.

637
00:31:50,202 --> 00:31:52,436
She walks like Kira;
she talks like Kira.

638
00:31:52,475 --> 00:31:54,412
Really?

639
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:57,944
How did you manage
to accomplish that?

640
00:31:57,989 --> 00:31:59,515
I don't have time
to explain now.

641
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:00,653
I'll see you tonight, 9:00...

642
00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:02,359
That's 2100 to you.

643
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,892
I know.

644
00:32:03,937 --> 00:32:05,236
I'll see you then, pally.

645
00:32:14,031 --> 00:32:16,401
I believe
you two know each other.

646
00:32:18,074 --> 00:32:20,273
You look lovely.

647
00:32:20,314 --> 00:32:22,114
Thank you.

648
00:32:22,151 --> 00:32:23,985
So do you.

649
00:32:24,023 --> 00:32:26,017
Mademoiselle.

650
00:32:36,656 --> 00:32:39,528
I'll be your server
this evening.

651
00:32:39,563 --> 00:32:42,297
I'll try not to spill anything.

652
00:32:42,338 --> 00:32:45,973
To begin, a little
Dom Perignon, '55

653
00:32:46,014 --> 00:32:49,182
and some Oysters Rockefeller...

654
00:32:49,222 --> 00:32:51,990
to be followed by Caesar salad

655
00:32:52,029 --> 00:32:55,732
chateaubriand
and cherries jubilee.

656
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:06,127
This is all very interesting,
but, uh...

657
00:33:07,636 --> 00:33:11,305
don't you feel a little silly
being here in a holosuite?

658
00:33:15,824 --> 00:33:17,157
A bit.

659
00:33:17,194 --> 00:33:19,758
Let me know when you're ready
for the salad.

660
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,986
<i>Bon appetit.</i>

661
00:33:31,031 --> 00:33:32,557
It's French.

662
00:33:32,601 --> 00:33:34,971
An Earth language.

663
00:33:35,007 --> 00:33:37,171
It means "enjoy your meal."

664
00:33:37,213 --> 00:33:39,013
I didn't know you spoke French.

665
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:40,543
I don't.

666
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:43,118
It's something
I learned from Vic.

667
00:33:43,162 --> 00:33:45,326
French is, uh...

668
00:33:45,367 --> 00:33:48,341
the language of love.

669
00:33:50,448 --> 00:33:52,647
Vic's a fountain of information.

670
00:33:52,686 --> 00:33:55,524
He's certainly a man
of many talents.

671
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:02,405
But...

672
00:34:02,445 --> 00:34:05,886
we're really not here
to talk about Vic, are we?

673
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:10,461
I'm certainly not.

674
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,130
Hmm.

675
00:34:15,412 --> 00:34:18,078
I always wondered
what this would be like.

676
00:34:20,626 --> 00:34:22,928
The two of us having
dinner together?

677
00:34:22,965 --> 00:34:27,170
It's certainly not the way
I pictured it would be.

678
00:34:28,312 --> 00:34:29,976
It is a bit unusual.

679
00:34:34,662 --> 00:34:35,858
Is something wrong?

680
00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:37,767
You haven't touched your food.

681
00:34:37,803 --> 00:34:39,865
No, it-it looks delicious.

682
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,311
I-I'm not hungry.

683
00:34:43,819 --> 00:34:46,383
Truth is I'm a little nervous.

684
00:34:46,426 --> 00:34:48,796
You? Nervous?

685
00:34:48,832 --> 00:34:50,427
A bit.

686
00:34:53,144 --> 00:34:56,847
It is our first date, right?

687
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:58,721
Right.

688
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:04,966
Well, there's nothing wrong
with being a little nervous

689
00:35:05,008 --> 00:35:07,412
as long as
it doesn't get in the way.

690
00:35:07,448 --> 00:35:08,508
Of what?

691
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,384
Of enjoying yourself.

692
00:35:10,421 --> 00:35:13,418
I thought the only thing
you enjoy is your work.

693
00:35:13,463 --> 00:35:15,023
How'd you know that?

694
00:35:16,471 --> 00:35:19,239
You told me yourself.

695
00:35:23,389 --> 00:35:25,326
Well done, Vic.

696
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,454
Vic?

697
00:35:26,497 --> 00:35:28,593
Never mind.

698
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,638
I do...

699
00:35:33,681 --> 00:35:35,116
enjoy my work.

700
00:35:36,589 --> 00:35:40,896
But I'm afraid
I've used it as an excuse

701
00:35:40,934 --> 00:35:44,170
to avoid the rest of my life.

702
00:35:45,947 --> 00:35:47,679
I know the feeling.

703
00:35:54,035 --> 00:35:58,206
I've got you

704
00:35:58,246 --> 00:36:01,379
Under my skin

705
00:36:03,392 --> 00:36:05,887
I've got you

706
00:36:07,002 --> 00:36:10,944
Deep in the heart of me

707
00:36:12,984 --> 00:36:16,585
So deep in my heart

708
00:36:16,627 --> 00:36:20,730
You're really a part of me

709
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:24,042
I've got you

710
00:36:26,386 --> 00:36:28,824
Under my skin...

711
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:30,591
It's a pretty song.

712
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:33,794
It is, isn't it?

713
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:36,572
You're sure you're not hungry?

714
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:38,047
I'm sure.

715
00:36:38,149 --> 00:36:40,883
What do we do now?

716
00:36:42,126 --> 00:36:44,029
Only one thing we can do.

717
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:45,695
Dance with me.

718
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:48,208
I-I'm not sure
I know how to dance

719
00:36:48,243 --> 00:36:49,473
to this kind of music.

720
00:36:49,512 --> 00:36:52,350
Just... stay close.

721
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:56,088
You never can...

722
00:36:56,129 --> 00:36:57,098
Oh, sorry.

723
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,101
No, that's good.

724
00:36:58,134 --> 00:37:03,011
Use your mentality

725
00:37:03,047 --> 00:37:06,648
Wake up to reality...

726
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:07,716
Whoo!

727
00:37:08,762 --> 00:37:10,892
And each time I do

728
00:37:10,934 --> 00:37:15,207
Just the thought of you
makes me stop

729
00:37:15,246 --> 00:37:19,656
Before I begin

730
00:37:19,691 --> 00:37:24,135
'Cause I've got you...

731
00:37:26,074 --> 00:37:28,376
I had no idea you could dance.

732
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:32,412
It's amazing what you can learn
in a holosuite.

733
00:37:32,457 --> 00:37:35,363
I can't believe
we're having our first date

734
00:37:35,398 --> 00:37:36,594
in a holosuite.

735
00:37:40,177 --> 00:37:44,986
'Cause I've got you

736
00:37:45,022 --> 00:37:50,093
Under my skin.

737
00:37:50,136 --> 00:37:51,936
I understand
that you wouldn't be

738
00:37:51,974 --> 00:37:54,469
comfortable at Quark's,
but I know one or two

739
00:37:54,514 --> 00:37:56,884
out-of-the-way
restaurants on the station.

740
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,792
Well, I don't think
that's possible.

741
00:37:59,828 --> 00:38:03,030
You embarrassed
of being seen with me?

742
00:38:03,069 --> 00:38:07,844
No.
No.

743
00:38:07,882 --> 00:38:09,512
I meant...

744
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:11,079
it would be difficult

745
00:38:11,124 --> 00:38:12,423
for you to leave the holosuite.

746
00:38:12,461 --> 00:38:13,760
Why?

747
00:38:15,569 --> 00:38:17,164
Well, it's complicated.

748
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,180
Complicated to leave
a holosuite?

749
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,117
You make it sound
like I'm a hologram.

750
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:24,850
Aren't you?

751
00:38:26,764 --> 00:38:28,462
Is that what you think?

752
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,405
Maybe you'd better tell her.

753
00:38:33,449 --> 00:38:34,918
There's nothing to tell.

754
00:38:34,952 --> 00:38:37,082
I'm good, pally,
but I'm not that good.

755
00:38:38,261 --> 00:38:40,289
You been dancing
with the real McCoy.

756
00:38:43,207 --> 00:38:44,335
You tricked me!

757
00:38:44,377 --> 00:38:45,471
And me.

758
00:38:45,513 --> 00:38:47,381
Hey, I brought
you two lovebirds together.

759
00:38:47,418 --> 00:38:48,978
That was whole the idea,
wasn't it?

760
00:38:50,393 --> 00:38:52,125
Nerys...

761
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:53,964
Kira...

762
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:56,131
Major...

763
00:39:02,825 --> 00:39:04,693
Don't say it.

764
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:06,724
Computer, end program.

765
00:39:18,452 --> 00:39:20,947
Odo? Are you there?

766
00:39:20,993 --> 00:39:22,588
I have nothing to say to you.

767
00:39:22,629 --> 00:39:24,828
Look, I know you think
I sold you down the river.

768
00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:26,361
You lied to me!

769
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:28,036
It was for your own good.

770
00:39:28,077 --> 00:39:30,481
It was time for you to stop
playing around with holograms

771
00:39:30,517 --> 00:39:32,249
and start playing around
with the real thing.

772
00:39:32,288 --> 00:39:34,418
You should have told me
it was really Kira.

773
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,260
Would you have shown up
if I had?

774
00:39:38,972 --> 00:39:40,670
I don't hear an answer, pally.

775
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:43,707
If you think about it, there's
not much to be mad about.

776
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:45,084
I saw the way she looked at you

777
00:39:45,121 --> 00:39:46,853
while the two of you
were dancing.

778
00:39:46,893 --> 00:39:48,453
The lady digs you big time.

779
00:39:48,496 --> 00:39:51,264
She "digs" Shakaar.

780
00:39:51,304 --> 00:39:53,776
I can only imagine
what she thinks of me.

781
00:39:53,811 --> 00:39:56,340
I kept insisting
she was a hologram.

782
00:39:56,384 --> 00:39:57,353
Odo, listen to me.

783
00:39:57,387 --> 00:39:59,859
No! I'm done listening to you!

784
00:39:59,893 --> 00:40:02,127
Computer, end transmission.

785
00:40:07,145 --> 00:40:09,013
Are you going to tell
me what's wrong?

786
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:11,180
Oh, there's nothing wrong.

787
00:40:11,223 --> 00:40:14,197
Have you ever had a moment
of pure clarity...

788
00:40:14,231 --> 00:40:16,533
a moment where the truth
seems to just leap up

789
00:40:16,569 --> 00:40:17,936
and grab you by the throat?

790
00:40:17,974 --> 00:40:21,005
I bet this has something to do
with your visit with Shakaar.

791
00:40:21,047 --> 00:40:22,380
Oh, this has nothing
to do with Shakaar.

792
00:40:22,418 --> 00:40:24,446
Now, tell me, have you ever
had a moment like that?

793
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,429
One or two, but, of course

794
00:40:26,529 --> 00:40:28,363
that's over a span
of seven lifetimes.

795
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,673
Only two moments of clarity
in seven lifetimes?

796
00:40:32,711 --> 00:40:36,414
Nerys, total clarity
is a very rare thing.

797
00:40:36,454 --> 00:40:37,821
I guess so.

798
00:40:37,858 --> 00:40:39,350
And when it comes to you

799
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:40,991
it's important
that you act on it

800
00:40:41,033 --> 00:40:43,471
because... believe me

801
00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:45,271
confusion and doubt
will take over

802
00:40:45,311 --> 00:40:46,644
before you know it.

803
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:51,486
You're absolutely right.

804
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:54,767
Makes perfect sense.

805
00:40:54,802 --> 00:40:55,964
Don't tell me
you're having another

806
00:40:56,005 --> 00:40:57,372
"moment of clarity."

807
00:40:57,409 --> 00:40:59,073
That's two in two days.

808
00:40:59,113 --> 00:41:01,449
That's amazing.

809
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,361
Odo, wait.

810
00:41:08,404 --> 00:41:09,464
Major, if you don't mind

811
00:41:09,507 --> 00:41:11,033
I'd like to forget
all about last night.

812
00:41:11,077 --> 00:41:12,239
I don't think
that's a good idea.

813
00:41:12,281 --> 00:41:13,648
We need to talk
about what happened.

814
00:41:13,685 --> 00:41:15,656
Very well, then we can meet
in my office in an hour.

815
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:16,886
No, let's discuss it
over dinner.

816
00:41:16,926 --> 00:41:17,895
Dinner?

817
00:41:17,928 --> 00:41:19,124
Yeah, you can choose
the restaurant.

818
00:41:19,165 --> 00:41:20,134
Anywhere but a holosuite.

819
00:41:20,168 --> 00:41:21,137
What about Shakaar?

820
00:41:21,171 --> 00:41:22,197
Do you think he'll approve?

821
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,735
Look, I don't care
whether he approves or not.

822
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,340
Shakaar and I are friends.

823
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:28,184
That's all... friends.

824
00:41:28,222 --> 00:41:30,717
The First Minister
asked me to update him

825
00:41:30,762 --> 00:41:32,197
on the war with the Dominion.

826
00:41:32,232 --> 00:41:33,667
My visit was strictly business.

827
00:41:33,704 --> 00:41:36,040
Now, are we going to have
dinner together or not?

828
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,170
And if we do, then what?

829
00:41:37,212 --> 00:41:38,545
I don't know, maybe we
could go dancing.

830
00:41:38,582 --> 00:41:40,553
And after that, I suppose
you'll expect me to kiss you.

831
00:41:40,588 --> 00:41:41,557
Well, it's possible.

832
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:42,650
Well then, who needs dinner?

833
00:41:42,693 --> 00:41:43,787
Why don't I just
get it over with

834
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:44,821
and kiss you right now?

835
00:41:44,865 --> 00:41:45,925
Well, why don't you?

836
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:10,086
You're right.

837
00:42:10,131 --> 00:42:12,034
Who needs dinner?

838
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:13,835
'Cause I've got you

839
00:42:16,146 --> 00:42:18,984
Under my skin

840
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:25,905
'Cause I've got you

841
00:42:25,939 --> 00:42:30,042
Under my skin.

842
00:42:39,941 --> 00:42:41,605
Here in Vegas,
there's only one way

843
00:42:41,646 --> 00:42:43,514
to make sure
you don't lose any money.

844
00:42:43,551 --> 00:42:45,181
The moment
you step off the plane

845
00:42:45,222 --> 00:42:46,817
you walk
right into the propellers.

846
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,867
See you
in a few minutes, folks.

847
00:42:51,872 --> 00:42:55,336
Odo.
Hey, long time no see.

848
00:42:55,382 --> 00:42:56,476
Well, I've been busy.

849
00:42:56,518 --> 00:42:57,578
So I hear.

850
00:42:57,621 --> 00:42:59,649
Julian tells me you and
the Major are quite an item.

851
00:42:59,693 --> 00:43:01,060
Well, for the moment.

852
00:43:01,096 --> 00:43:02,794
Who knows how long it'll last.

853
00:43:02,834 --> 00:43:03,894
That's my Odo...

854
00:43:03,938 --> 00:43:06,172
always ready
to turn victory into defeat.

855
00:43:07,346 --> 00:43:11,517
I... wanted to thank you
for all your help.

856
00:43:11,557 --> 00:43:12,924
Anytime, pally.

857
00:43:12,961 --> 00:43:14,659
Anytime.

858
00:43:14,732 --> 00:43:16,396
Hey, you feel like
sitting in on a number?

859
00:43:16,437 --> 00:43:19,103
Uh... some other time.

860
00:43:20,113 --> 00:43:22,381
Well, say hi
to the Major for me.

861
00:43:23,488 --> 00:43:24,548
Hey, do me a favor.

862
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:26,788
Leave the program running

863
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:28,231
for a few minutes
after you leave.

864
00:43:28,267 --> 00:43:30,397
I feel like singing.

865
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:33,471
Whatever makes you happy.

866
00:43:45,445 --> 00:43:47,313
Come fly with me

867
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:50,324
Come fly, let's fly away

868
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:55,863
If you can use
some exotic booze

869
00:43:55,906 --> 00:43:59,210
There's a bar in far Bombay

870
00:43:59,247 --> 00:44:03,918
It's perfect
for a flying honeymoon

871
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,897
They say

872
00:44:05,932 --> 00:44:08,096
Come fly with me

873
00:44:08,137 --> 00:44:12,980
Come fly, let's fly away

874
00:44:13,016 --> 00:44:15,420
Come fly with me

875
00:44:15,456 --> 00:44:19,489
Pack up, let's fly away.
