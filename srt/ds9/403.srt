1
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:04,135
May I help you?

2
00:01:04,179 --> 00:01:06,582
I'm sorry to bother you.

3
00:01:06,618 --> 00:01:09,420
I just, um... been...

4
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:10,586
You're hurt.

5
00:01:10,628 --> 00:01:14,262
Yeah, I must have
scraped myself on a branch.

6
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,273
Ah, that's what happens
when you go tromping

7
00:01:16,341 --> 00:01:18,278
around the bayou
in the middle of the night.

8
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:20,613
Come on, warm yourself up
by the fire.

9
00:01:20,652 --> 00:01:24,822
Now, I have a first aid kit
around here somewhere.

10
00:01:24,862 --> 00:01:26,525
Where is it?

11
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:30,029
So, what are you
doing out here anyway?

12
00:01:30,074 --> 00:01:32,876
I'm a writer.

13
00:01:32,914 --> 00:01:35,317
At least I want to be.

14
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,225
And the truth is...

15
00:01:39,263 --> 00:01:41,063
I was looking for you.

16
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,071
Oh?

17
00:01:43,105 --> 00:01:45,008
You are Jake Sisko, the writer?

18
00:01:45,043 --> 00:01:46,376
Yes.

19
00:01:48,084 --> 00:01:50,716
I can't believe
I'm really here...

20
00:01:50,757 --> 00:01:52,557
talking to you.

21
00:01:52,594 --> 00:01:56,091
You are my favorite author
of all time.

22
00:01:56,136 --> 00:01:58,938
You should read more.

23
00:01:58,976 --> 00:02:00,138
I mean it.

24
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:04,281
Your books, they're so...
insightful.

25
00:02:04,323 --> 00:02:06,556
I'm glad you like them.

26
00:02:06,595 --> 00:02:08,292
There.

27
00:02:08,332 --> 00:02:09,767
Good as new.

28
00:02:09,802 --> 00:02:10,964
Thank you.

29
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,499
I didn't realize people
still read my books.

30
00:02:13,545 --> 00:02:15,641
Of course they do.

31
00:02:15,684 --> 00:02:17,621
A friend recommended
<i>Anslem</i> to me

32
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:20,593
and I read it straight through
twice in one night.

33
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:22,725
Twice in one night?

34
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,331
It made me want to read
everything you'd ever written

35
00:02:25,373 --> 00:02:26,363
but when I looked

36
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:28,380
all I could find
was your <i>Collected Stories.</i>

37
00:02:28,413 --> 00:02:30,316
I couldn't believe it.

38
00:02:30,352 --> 00:02:34,020
I'd finally found someone
whose writing I really admired

39
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,589
and he'd only published
two books.

40
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:39,766
Not much to show
for a life's work, is it?

41
00:02:39,807 --> 00:02:42,939
I'm going to go get us some tea.

42
00:02:44,954 --> 00:02:47,425
I savored those stories.

43
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,019
I read them slowly,
one each day

44
00:02:49,063 --> 00:02:50,031
and when I was done

45
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:51,866
I wished I hadn't
read them at all.

46
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:56,270
So I could read them again
like it was the first time.

47
00:02:56,313 --> 00:03:00,449
There's only one first time
for everything, isn't there?

48
00:03:00,557 --> 00:03:03,998
And only one last time, too.

49
00:03:04,032 --> 00:03:08,202
You think about such things
when you get to be my age.

50
00:03:08,242 --> 00:03:14,656
That today may be the last time
you sit in your favorite chair

51
00:03:14,691 --> 00:03:17,060
or watch the rain fall

52
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:21,598
or enjoy
a cup of tea by a warm fire.

53
00:03:25,117 --> 00:03:27,088
Can I ask you something?

54
00:03:27,122 --> 00:03:29,218
Of course.

55
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,231
Why did you stop writing?

56
00:03:32,935 --> 00:03:35,338
I lost my favorite pen

57
00:03:35,374 --> 00:03:38,108
and I couldn't get
any work done without it.

58
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:42,588
You're joking.

59
00:03:44,863 --> 00:03:47,461
You weren't even 40
when you stopped writing.

60
00:03:47,503 --> 00:03:49,736
I never understood
why you gave it up.

61
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:54,850
It's a long story.

62
00:03:54,887 --> 00:03:57,120
I have time.

63
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,894
Tell me.

64
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:02,200
Please.

65
00:04:07,785 --> 00:04:11,989
If you had shown up yesterday

66
00:04:12,028 --> 00:04:14,967
or the day before or a week ago

67
00:04:15,003 --> 00:04:19,605
I would have said no
and sent you on your way

68
00:04:19,647 --> 00:04:25,184
but here you are,
today of all days

69
00:04:25,227 --> 00:04:28,291
and somehow it seems like

70
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:32,241
the right time for me
to finally tell this story.

71
00:04:38,793 --> 00:04:43,361
It begins many years ago.

72
00:04:43,404 --> 00:04:46,002
I was 18

73
00:04:46,044 --> 00:04:51,250
and the worst thing
that could happen to a young man

74
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:52,883
happened to me.

75
00:04:56,435 --> 00:04:59,033
My father died.

76
00:07:07,776 --> 00:07:11,980
We were very close,
my father and I

77
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,756
partly because
we'd lost my mother

78
00:07:15,862 --> 00:07:17,525
several years earlier.

79
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:19,230
I know.

80
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,434
I read a biography about you.

81
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:23,310
It said that you stopped writing

82
00:07:23,347 --> 00:07:25,750
so you could conduct
scientific research.

83
00:07:25,786 --> 00:07:28,884
Ah, it's not quite that simple.

84
00:07:28,927 --> 00:07:31,421
You see, just before
my father died

85
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:33,699
I was working on a short story.

86
00:07:33,738 --> 00:07:36,575
I don't remember
what it was about

87
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:39,676
but I do know that I was
taking it very seriously.

88
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,024
I worked on it night
and day for weeks

89
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,531
and I wasn't making any headway.

90
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:47,538
It was making me miserable.

91
00:07:47,572 --> 00:07:50,374
I suppose my father saw
that I needed a break

92
00:07:50,412 --> 00:07:51,813
because he insisted

93
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:54,515
I come with him
to the Gamma Quadrant

94
00:07:54,555 --> 00:07:56,320
to watch the wormhole undergo

95
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:58,694
what they call
"a subspace inversion."

96
00:07:58,731 --> 00:08:00,496
Jake-o, let's go.

97
00:08:03,176 --> 00:08:05,113
Of course,
what he didn't realize

98
00:08:05,147 --> 00:08:07,915
was that I could hide away
on the <i>Defiant</i>

99
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,893
just as easily
as I could on the station.

100
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,795
Yeah?

101
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,672
Jake, this only happens
once every 50 years.

102
00:08:17,711 --> 00:08:20,707
You will never forgive
yourself if you miss it.

103
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,243
Yeah, I'll be right there.

104
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:24,088
Well, that's what you said
ten minutes ago.

105
00:08:24,126 --> 00:08:26,359
I just want to get this
last paragraph right.

106
00:08:26,398 --> 00:08:29,030
I thought you were going
to put that aside for a while.

107
00:08:29,071 --> 00:08:31,542
I tried, but it's all
I can think about.

108
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:35,849
Well... I'm no writer

109
00:08:35,887 --> 00:08:38,051
but if I were

110
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:40,111
it seems to me I'd want
to poke my head up

111
00:08:40,244 --> 00:08:42,408
every once in a while
and take a look around

112
00:08:42,449 --> 00:08:43,748
see what's going on.

113
00:08:43,786 --> 00:08:45,449
It's life, Jake.

114
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:48,589
You can miss it
if you don't open your eyes.

115
00:08:48,631 --> 00:08:52,596
Now... what do you say

116
00:08:52,675 --> 00:08:54,042
you come up
to the Bridge with me

117
00:08:54,078 --> 00:08:56,744
and we'll watch
the wormhole do its thing.

118
00:08:56,784 --> 00:08:58,618
And then I'll read
what you've got

119
00:08:58,722 --> 00:09:00,055
and we'll talk about it.

120
00:09:00,092 --> 00:09:01,652
Deal?

121
00:09:01,696 --> 00:09:03,165
Deal.

122
00:09:06,174 --> 00:09:07,142
Sisko to Bridge.

123
00:09:07,176 --> 00:09:08,144
What happened?

124
00:09:08,178 --> 00:09:09,738
The wormhole's gravimetric field
is surging.

125
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,115
Pull us to a safe distance.

126
00:09:11,152 --> 00:09:13,681
I'm on it, Benjamin,
but we've got another problem.

127
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:15,285
The power output
from the warp core

128
00:09:15,328 --> 00:09:16,558
just jumped off the scale.

129
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,295
Sisko to Engineering.

130
00:09:18,336 --> 00:09:20,204
Engineering, report.

131
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,806
Dax, I'm going to see
what's going on down there.

132
00:09:23,849 --> 00:09:25,045
Stay here, Jake.

133
00:09:27,992 --> 00:09:32,401
Most of the time, I knew enough
to do what my father told me

134
00:09:32,436 --> 00:09:35,273
but that day, for some reason,
I didn't.

135
00:09:36,212 --> 00:09:38,376
Sisko to Sick Bay.

136
00:09:38,418 --> 00:09:40,651
I need a medical team
down here right away.

137
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,989
Dax to Sisko.

138
00:09:42,026 --> 00:09:44,327
The warp coils are locked
into a feedback loop.

139
00:09:44,365 --> 00:09:47,236
You've got to realign them
or the core is going to blow.

140
00:09:47,272 --> 00:09:48,935
I'm on it!

141
00:09:51,749 --> 00:09:54,779
Jake, I need
an interphasic compensator.

142
00:09:54,824 --> 00:09:59,358
Warning. Warp core breach
in 40 seconds.

143
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:02,864
Dax, better stand by
to eject the core.

144
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:04,003
We can't.

145
00:10:04,045 --> 00:10:05,982
The ejection system's off line.

146
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:10,919
Jake, where's that compensator?

147
00:10:10,962 --> 00:10:14,060
It's not here!

148
00:10:14,103 --> 00:10:16,506
Warning. Warp core breach
in 30 seconds.

149
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:18,536
Got it.

150
00:10:26,866 --> 00:10:29,703
I'm going to try shunting
the excess power out through

151
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,209
the deflector array.

152
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:34,149
Warning. Warp core breach
in 20 seconds.

153
00:10:34,185 --> 00:10:36,088
Just a little more.

154
00:10:39,363 --> 00:10:41,094
There.

155
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:53,830
No!

156
00:10:53,865 --> 00:10:56,200
He was gone.

157
00:10:56,237 --> 00:10:59,404
I'm not sure I could
ever get over

158
00:10:59,445 --> 00:11:04,412
losing somebody like that
right in front of my eyes.

159
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:06,360
People do.

160
00:11:06,395 --> 00:11:08,389
Time passes

161
00:11:08,432 --> 00:11:10,630
and they realize
that the person they lost

162
00:11:10,672 --> 00:11:12,802
is really gone...

163
00:11:12,877 --> 00:11:14,677
and they heal.

164
00:11:14,714 --> 00:11:16,878
Is that what happened
to you?

165
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:21,557
No.

166
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,001
I suppose not.

167
00:11:24,037 --> 00:11:27,169
There was a memorial service
aboard the station.

168
00:11:27,211 --> 00:11:32,087
People came forward
and talked about my father...

169
00:11:32,123 --> 00:11:34,356
what they remembered
most about him

170
00:11:34,395 --> 00:11:37,368
and why they would miss him.

171
00:11:37,402 --> 00:11:39,771
Benjamin Sisko

172
00:11:39,808 --> 00:11:43,750
was more
than my commanding officer.

173
00:11:43,784 --> 00:11:47,054
He was the Emissary
to my people

174
00:11:47,093 --> 00:11:48,562
sent by the Prophets

175
00:11:48,596 --> 00:11:53,267
but most importantly,
he was my friend.

176
00:11:53,307 --> 00:11:56,337
I didn't step forward.

177
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,544
I couldn't.

178
00:11:57,584 --> 00:12:00,148
I felt that no matter
what I said about him

179
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,457
I'd be leaving
so much more out

180
00:12:02,496 --> 00:12:04,490
and that didn't seem right.

181
00:12:04,534 --> 00:12:08,407
I'd never felt more alone
in all my life.

182
00:12:08,443 --> 00:12:11,143
Everyone went out of their way
to look after me

183
00:12:11,183 --> 00:12:13,381
especially Dax.

184
00:12:13,422 --> 00:12:15,986
She was my father's
closest friend

185
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:19,126
and I guess she felt
responsible for me.

186
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,910
After a few months, things
started returning to normal...

187
00:12:25,952 --> 00:12:28,219
for everyone else, that is.

188
00:12:28,257 --> 00:12:30,855
Jake, I'm almost done.

189
00:12:30,897 --> 00:12:32,662
We have Holosuite 3
for half an hour.

190
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:33,691
Great.

191
00:12:33,738 --> 00:12:35,230
Nog, get down to the storeroom

192
00:12:35,274 --> 00:12:37,370
and bring up five kegs
of Takarian mead.

193
00:12:37,413 --> 00:12:38,848
Yes, Uncle.

194
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,786
Sorry, looks like

195
00:12:40,821 --> 00:12:42,951
we're going to lose
our holosuite reservation.

196
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:47,435
Uh, you know, Nog, things seem
to be slowing down a bit.

197
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,201
I'll get someone else
to bring up those kegs.

198
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:51,337
You and Jake
go and have some fun.

199
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:52,438
Are you sure?

200
00:12:52,482 --> 00:12:55,387
Go now, before I change my mind.

201
00:13:02,306 --> 00:13:03,775
Next time we go ion surfing

202
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,804
remind me to keep clear
of those whip curls.

203
00:13:05,848 --> 00:13:08,081
I don't know if I really
want to try it again.

204
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,492
You know, Jake,
I'm going to be gone soon.

205
00:13:11,528 --> 00:13:13,965
We probably won't
see each other for a while.

206
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,299
I know.

207
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:18,242
So, what are your plans?

208
00:13:18,277 --> 00:13:21,547
Well, I was thinking of taking
that deferred admission

209
00:13:21,586 --> 00:13:24,150
and going to Pennington
in the fall.

210
00:13:24,191 --> 00:13:25,387
Ah, that would be great!

211
00:13:25,428 --> 00:13:26,988
We'd both be on Earth together.

212
00:13:27,031 --> 00:13:29,595
But maybe I'll just
stick around here.

213
00:13:29,638 --> 00:13:32,007
I don't know.
I haven't decided yet.

214
00:13:34,215 --> 00:13:36,277
It's late.

215
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,414
I think I'll turn in.

216
00:13:37,457 --> 00:13:39,120
Okay.

217
00:14:00,345 --> 00:14:02,316
Jake.

218
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,184
Dad?

219
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,052
What happened?

220
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:20,756
I told Dax
about what had happened...

221
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,387
how it felt so real

222
00:14:22,431 --> 00:14:24,698
not like a dream at all.

223
00:14:24,737 --> 00:14:27,973
And she very kindly
obliged me and did

224
00:14:28,012 --> 00:14:29,983
a very thorough scan of my room.

225
00:14:30,016 --> 00:14:34,482
I felt vaguely ridiculous,
like a child insisting

226
00:14:34,527 --> 00:14:38,093
his parents check under
the bed for monsters.

227
00:14:38,136 --> 00:14:41,007
She tried to tell me it was
probably just a nightmare

228
00:14:41,043 --> 00:14:42,205
and I did my best

229
00:14:42,245 --> 00:14:45,116
to put the entire episode
out of my mind.

230
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:46,951
I puttered around the station

231
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,018
for the next eight
or nine months.

232
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:51,796
Nog was off at Starfleet.

233
00:14:51,835 --> 00:14:55,139
My stories stubbornly refused
to write themselves.

234
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,704
I filled my time playing dom-jot

235
00:14:57,749 --> 00:15:01,520
and tried not to think
about how alone I really felt.

236
00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:04,794
Dax and the others
were worried about me

237
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:09,299
but before long, they had
bigger things to worry about.

238
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:13,079
Tensions with the Klingons
were continuing to rise.

239
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,218
My father was
a kind of religious figure

240
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,824
to the Bajoran people,
and when he died

241
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:21,465
they took it as a sign
from the Prophets

242
00:15:21,506 --> 00:15:23,409
that the Federation
wouldn't be able

243
00:15:23,444 --> 00:15:25,278
to protect them
from the Klingons.

244
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:28,687
Eventually, Bajor entered
into a mutual defense pact

245
00:15:28,723 --> 00:15:30,283
with the Cardassians

246
00:15:30,327 --> 00:15:34,565
and the Klingons
didn't like that at all.

247
00:15:34,604 --> 00:15:36,438
The station's
civilian population

248
00:15:36,475 --> 00:15:37,671
was leaving en masse.

249
00:15:37,711 --> 00:15:40,343
They knew that if war broke out
against the Klingons

250
00:15:40,385 --> 00:15:44,156
Deep Space 9 was going
to be on the front line.

251
00:15:47,402 --> 00:15:48,769
Jake.

252
00:15:48,804 --> 00:15:51,002
Where are you going?

253
00:15:51,044 --> 00:15:53,015
I, uh, I thought I'd watch
the ships leave

254
00:15:53,048 --> 00:15:53,985
from one of the Upper Pylons.

255
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,884
You should be on
one of those ships.

256
00:15:56,926 --> 00:15:58,088
I don't have to go, do I?

257
00:15:58,129 --> 00:15:59,723
No.

258
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,771
It's a voluntary
resettlement

259
00:16:01,805 --> 00:16:03,104
not an evacuation.

260
00:16:03,141 --> 00:16:05,169
But it would be prudent
that you leave at this time.

261
00:16:05,212 --> 00:16:09,587
I suppose I wasn't feeling
very prudent that day

262
00:16:09,623 --> 00:16:12,790
because I ignored their advice.

263
00:16:12,831 --> 00:16:14,198
Jake...

264
00:16:16,072 --> 00:16:18,339
I wanted to talk
to you about something.

265
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,040
I spoke with your grandfather

266
00:16:20,081 --> 00:16:22,952
and he told me that he asked you
to go live with him.

267
00:16:26,363 --> 00:16:29,495
Even if this sector
weren't on the brink of war

268
00:16:29,537 --> 00:16:31,906
I would like to see you
leave this station.

269
00:16:31,943 --> 00:16:34,107
I'm not going anywhere.

270
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:35,516
Oh, Jake...

271
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:40,356
I could order you to go
if I wanted to.

272
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:44,632
Please don't make me leave.

273
00:16:44,674 --> 00:16:46,542
Not yet.

274
00:16:46,578 --> 00:16:48,172
This is my home.

275
00:16:50,488 --> 00:16:52,686
When my dad and I came here

276
00:16:52,726 --> 00:16:55,563
this place was just
an abandoned shell.

277
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,129
He turned it into something.

278
00:17:00,177 --> 00:17:03,447
Everywhere I look,
it's like I see a part of him.

279
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:09,760
If I leave...

280
00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:12,467
I won't have
anything left of him.

281
00:17:16,149 --> 00:17:18,313
Oh...

282
00:17:18,355 --> 00:17:19,949
all right.

283
00:17:19,992 --> 00:17:22,794
You stay a while longer
if you want to

284
00:17:22,865 --> 00:17:24,733
but you have to promise me

285
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:29,406
when the time comes
and I tell you to go

286
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:31,076
you'll do it.

287
00:17:49,763 --> 00:17:51,198
Dad?

288
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,875
It wasn't
until I actually touched him

289
00:17:56,947 --> 00:18:00,912
that I knew
this wasn't a dream.

290
00:18:02,093 --> 00:18:04,587
But something was wrong.

291
00:18:04,631 --> 00:18:07,000
I didn't understand
everything they were saying

292
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:09,509
but Dax and the others seemed
to think that the accident

293
00:18:09,543 --> 00:18:12,380
had somehow knocked
my father's temporal signature

294
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:13,579
out of phase.

295
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,385
Benjamin, what's the last
thing you remember?

296
00:18:15,424 --> 00:18:18,090
I was in Engineering,
on the <i>Defiant.</i>

297
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:20,102
It feels like a few minutes ago.

298
00:18:20,136 --> 00:18:22,836
Dad, it's been over a year
since the accident.

299
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:24,345
A year?

300
00:18:24,379 --> 00:18:25,871
How could that be?

301
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:29,652
We think the warp core discharge
pulled you into subspace.

302
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,160
If we're right,
that would explain

303
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:33,257
why you didn't experience
the passage of time.

304
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,530
According to these readings

305
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,700
unless we can realign
your temporal signature

306
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:37,836
you'll be pulled

307
00:18:37,878 --> 00:18:40,680
back into subspace again
within the next few minutes.

308
00:18:40,718 --> 00:18:42,655
Maybe we can set up
some sort of containment field.

309
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:47,828
Jake, they'll have me
fixed up in no time.

310
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:49,498
How are you doing?

311
00:18:57,558 --> 00:18:59,358
It's all right.

312
00:18:59,396 --> 00:19:02,700
Everything's going
to be all right.

313
00:19:06,714 --> 00:19:08,617
I thought it was a dream.

314
00:19:08,652 --> 00:19:11,648
What was?

315
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:17,336
When I, uh, when I saw you
in my quarters

316
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:21,041
I, uh... I should have
felt you were alive.

317
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:22,915
I should have known it.

318
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,049
It's not your fault, Jake.

319
00:19:25,091 --> 00:19:27,221
I'm here now.

320
00:19:27,263 --> 00:19:29,063
That's what matters.

321
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,937
We're losing him.

322
00:19:31,974 --> 00:19:35,244
Look at me.

323
00:19:35,282 --> 00:19:37,982
I need to know
you're going to be all right.

324
00:19:38,022 --> 00:19:40,493
His temporal signature
is fluctuating.

325
00:19:40,528 --> 00:19:42,795
I need that containment
field now, Chief.

326
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:43,824
Right away.

327
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:45,498
Field active.

328
00:19:47,612 --> 00:19:49,013
It's not working.

329
00:19:49,115 --> 00:19:50,448
Jake...

330
00:19:50,485 --> 00:19:51,384
Dad!

331
00:19:51,421 --> 00:19:52,411
Going to try

332
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:53,983
locking on to him
with the transporter beam.

333
00:19:55,632 --> 00:19:56,931
Don't leave me!

334
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:00,967
Don't leave me.

335
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:09,556
I didn't think
anything could be worse

336
00:20:09,598 --> 00:20:13,004
than losing him that first time
on the <i>Defiant</i>

337
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,534
until I was standing there

338
00:20:15,578 --> 00:20:21,992
staring down at his empty bed,
knowing he was alive

339
00:20:22,027 --> 00:20:27,803
yet trapped somewhere
that existed outside of time.

340
00:20:29,846 --> 00:20:33,412
I can't imagine what that
must have been like for you.

341
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,658
Can I get you something?

342
00:20:36,696 --> 00:20:38,724
No... nothing.

343
00:20:38,768 --> 00:20:40,602
Telling me all this
is hard for you.

344
00:20:40,638 --> 00:20:42,802
Maybe I should come back
some other time.

345
00:20:42,845 --> 00:20:46,012
No. There won't be
any other time.

346
00:20:46,052 --> 00:20:48,616
You see...

347
00:20:48,658 --> 00:20:50,856
I'm dying.

348
00:21:00,721 --> 00:21:02,247
You must understand

349
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:05,629
that when a person
my age says he's dying

350
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:08,034
he's only admitting
to the inevitable.

351
00:21:08,071 --> 00:21:12,138
Besides, we old people
need to remind everyone

352
00:21:12,182 --> 00:21:14,848
to pay special attention to us.

353
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:18,920
If that's what you're up to,
you shouldn't have bothered.

354
00:21:18,964 --> 00:21:23,066
You have my attention already.

355
00:21:23,107 --> 00:21:24,838
You're a good listener.

356
00:21:24,878 --> 00:21:26,906
That's important in a writer.

357
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,482
I'm not a writer yet.

358
00:21:30,525 --> 00:21:32,689
Sounds like you're waiting
for something to happen

359
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,199
that's going
to turn you into one.

360
00:21:34,234 --> 00:21:35,703
I'm not waiting.

361
00:21:35,737 --> 00:21:37,765
I'm doing a lot of reading

362
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:40,110
you know, to see how it's done

363
00:21:40,148 --> 00:21:42,746
and I'm still trying
to figure out

364
00:21:42,787 --> 00:21:44,381
what it is
I want to write about.

365
00:21:44,425 --> 00:21:45,655
I see.

366
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:49,430
So what happened?

367
00:21:49,471 --> 00:21:51,100
With your father, I mean.

368
00:21:51,141 --> 00:21:52,975
Did you ever see him again?

369
00:21:53,013 --> 00:21:54,676
For the next few months

370
00:21:54,716 --> 00:21:58,350
Dax and O'Brien tried
to find a way to locate him.

371
00:21:58,392 --> 00:22:01,889
They even considered
recreating the accident

372
00:22:01,934 --> 00:22:04,201
but that was impossible
since the wormhole

373
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:07,543
wasn't going to undergo
an inversion for decades.

374
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,214
Eventually the situation with
the Klingons came to a head

375
00:22:11,323 --> 00:22:13,852
and the Federation
decided to turn over

376
00:22:13,896 --> 00:22:17,929
control of the station
to the Klingon Empire.

377
00:22:17,973 --> 00:22:21,174
There was nothing I could do.

378
00:22:21,213 --> 00:22:24,551
I had to leave my home
of five years

379
00:22:24,588 --> 00:22:27,082
and give up
whatever hope there was

380
00:22:27,127 --> 00:22:30,568
of seeing my father again.

381
00:22:30,602 --> 00:22:32,003
Did the Klingons
ever contact Starfleet

382
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:33,508
to say that your father
had reappeared?

383
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:35,570
No.

384
00:22:35,614 --> 00:22:37,949
I was left with no choice

385
00:22:37,987 --> 00:22:40,983
but to try
and get on with my life.

386
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:47,203
I went to Earth, drifted around,
and eventually ended up

387
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:50,044
studying writing
at the Pennington School.

388
00:22:50,082 --> 00:22:55,026
After graduation,
I settled here in Louisiana

389
00:22:55,061 --> 00:22:56,964
so I could be near
my grandfather.

390
00:22:56,999 --> 00:22:59,699
He had a restaurant
in the French Quarter, you know.

391
00:22:59,739 --> 00:23:00,798
I've been there.

392
00:23:00,841 --> 00:23:02,641
It's still called Sisko's.

393
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:03,978
And on the wall, there's a copy

394
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:05,542
of the letter
your publisher sent you

395
00:23:05,586 --> 00:23:07,283
when he accepted
your first novel.

396
00:23:07,357 --> 00:23:11,093
Grandpa was always showing off
his famous grandson.

397
00:23:11,133 --> 00:23:15,098
He was just as proud of me
as my father would have been.

398
00:23:15,176 --> 00:23:19,710
You wrote <i>Anslem</i> in this house,
didn't you?

399
00:23:19,753 --> 00:23:22,190
At that desk, right over there.

400
00:23:22,226 --> 00:23:25,667
It came out to generally
favorable reviews

401
00:23:25,701 --> 00:23:27,034
and little by little

402
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:30,135
I began to think
less and less about the past.

403
00:23:30,178 --> 00:23:34,177
After a while, I met a woman...

404
00:23:34,221 --> 00:23:35,554
fell in love

405
00:23:35,591 --> 00:23:40,501
we got married, and for a while,
this house was a happy one.

406
00:23:40,537 --> 00:23:41,311
I'm back!

407
00:23:42,447 --> 00:23:43,541
Nog!

408
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,451
I didn't realize
you were here already.

409
00:23:45,488 --> 00:23:47,048
I was trying
to finish a painting

410
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:48,287
before the light changed

411
00:23:48,328 --> 00:23:50,424
and I guess the time
got away from me.

412
00:23:50,466 --> 00:23:51,434
It's good to see you.

413
00:23:51,468 --> 00:23:52,436
You, too.

414
00:23:52,471 --> 00:23:53,530
Did you start the grill?

415
00:23:53,573 --> 00:23:54,541
Mm-hmm.

416
00:23:54,576 --> 00:23:55,772
Oh, what are we having?

417
00:23:55,879 --> 00:23:57,782
Blackened redfish,
fresh from the bayou.

418
00:23:57,817 --> 00:23:59,116
Fish?!

419
00:23:59,154 --> 00:24:01,888
When these woods are crawling
with perfectly good slugs?

420
00:24:01,927 --> 00:24:04,398
I suppose you're going to ask me
to chew your food for you.

421
00:24:05,469 --> 00:24:07,372
I have to admit I've been
more popular with women

422
00:24:07,407 --> 00:24:09,310
since I stopped
asking them to do that.

423
00:24:09,344 --> 00:24:11,315
I tried to tell you
that 20 years ago.

424
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:12,408
I'm a slow learner.

425
00:24:12,453 --> 00:24:14,356
I'm going to get some champagne.

426
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,757
I'm glad you're here, Nog.

427
00:24:15,793 --> 00:24:17,730
I see you've got another
pip on your collar.

428
00:24:17,765 --> 00:24:19,759
You keep that up,
you're going to make Captain

429
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:20,860
by the time you're 40.

430
00:24:20,905 --> 00:24:22,534
The last time we talked,
you mentioned

431
00:24:22,577 --> 00:24:24,445
you might be heading back
to the Bajoran sector.

432
00:24:26,486 --> 00:24:28,514
The Klingons agreed
to let Starfleet

433
00:24:28,557 --> 00:24:30,790
send an expedition
through the wormhole.

434
00:24:30,896 --> 00:24:33,367
They said it was in the spirit
of scientific exchange.

435
00:24:33,402 --> 00:24:35,464
But I think they were happy
to have us test the waters

436
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:37,205
in the Gamma Quadrant
after all these years.

437
00:24:37,245 --> 00:24:39,182
Find out how
the Dominion would react

438
00:24:39,216 --> 00:24:40,515
to ships coming through.

439
00:24:40,553 --> 00:24:42,318
Did you see the station?

440
00:24:44,529 --> 00:24:47,434
I'm sorry to say it's looking
a little run-down these days.

441
00:24:48,873 --> 00:24:51,367
But you'll never guess
who's still there.

442
00:24:51,412 --> 00:24:52,608
Not your father?

443
00:24:52,649 --> 00:24:54,779
No, no. He and my uncle
left years ago.

444
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,312
Quark finally
got that little moon

445
00:24:56,357 --> 00:24:57,587
he was always talking about

446
00:24:57,627 --> 00:25:00,121
and my father, as usual,
is making sure

447
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,103
it doesn't fall out of orbit

448
00:25:02,138 --> 00:25:06,103
but Morn is still there,
running the bar.

449
00:25:06,148 --> 00:25:07,811
Talking his customers' ears off

450
00:25:07,851 --> 00:25:09,947
and drinking himself
out of business, I'll bet.

451
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,154
Well, why don't we
get to the point

452
00:25:12,195 --> 00:25:13,824
of today's little celebration?

453
00:25:17,742 --> 00:25:20,442
To my dear friend Jake Sisko...

454
00:25:20,482 --> 00:25:22,612
winner of this year's
Betar Prize

455
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,021
for his <i>Collected Stories.</i>

456
00:25:24,057 --> 00:25:27,327
May the years continue
to be good to you

457
00:25:27,365 --> 00:25:31,272
may your muse continue
to inspire you

458
00:25:31,308 --> 00:25:33,438
and may someone
make a holoprogram

459
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,881
out of one of your stories

460
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:36,716
so you can start
raking in the latinum.

461
00:25:43,069 --> 00:25:44,059
Are you all right?

462
00:25:44,105 --> 00:25:45,335
Do you want me to call a doctor?

463
00:25:45,374 --> 00:25:48,610
No.

464
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:49,913
I'll be fine.

465
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:52,115
You should rest.

466
00:25:52,158 --> 00:25:53,752
No, you came a long way

467
00:25:53,795 --> 00:25:56,359
to find out why I
had stopped writing

468
00:25:56,401 --> 00:25:58,429
and you deserve an answer.

469
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:01,537
Later that night,
after Nog had left

470
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,348
I stayed up working.

471
00:26:04,387 --> 00:26:06,483
My new novel was going well

472
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:09,988
and when it's going well,
you don't want to stop.

473
00:26:12,974 --> 00:26:14,307
Coming to bed?

474
00:26:16,048 --> 00:26:17,951
Um... I'm not tired.

475
00:26:21,127 --> 00:26:23,121
Neither am I.

476
00:26:36,197 --> 00:26:39,068
You know, I-I wanted
to ask you something.

477
00:26:39,104 --> 00:26:41,702
How would you feel
about designing the cover

478
00:26:41,743 --> 00:26:43,110
of my new book?

479
00:26:44,516 --> 00:26:46,145
Do you mean it?

480
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:49,758
What was that?

481
00:27:01,156 --> 00:27:02,489
Jake?

482
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:09,260
Did you get through?

483
00:27:09,297 --> 00:27:11,097
I talked to someone
at Starfleet Science.

484
00:27:11,135 --> 00:27:13,106
They're going to get a team
here as soon as they can.

485
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:17,549
This is Korena, my wife.

486
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,355
Your wife?

487
00:27:22,763 --> 00:27:25,327
I never thought I'd have
the pleasure of meeting you.

488
00:27:25,369 --> 00:27:28,137
The pleasure is mine.

489
00:27:28,176 --> 00:27:30,511
How long have you two
been married?

490
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:32,143
Seven years.

491
00:27:33,489 --> 00:27:34,548
Do I have any grandchildren?

492
00:27:34,591 --> 00:27:35,559
Not yet.

493
00:27:35,594 --> 00:27:36,722
We were married

494
00:27:36,763 --> 00:27:39,132
in New Orleans
in your father's restaurant.

495
00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:40,468
He insisted.

496
00:27:40,505 --> 00:27:42,442
Just about everybody came.

497
00:27:42,476 --> 00:27:44,470
Dax, Kira, O'Brien.

498
00:27:44,515 --> 00:27:47,215
That must have been something.

499
00:27:47,255 --> 00:27:49,624
I got to go call Starfleet.

500
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,893
Whoa.

501
00:27:51,932 --> 00:27:53,994
They'll get here
as soon as they can.

502
00:27:54,037 --> 00:27:55,267
Talk to me.

503
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:56,970
I've missed so much.

504
00:27:57,012 --> 00:27:59,381
Let's not waste
what little time we have.

505
00:27:59,417 --> 00:28:03,621
I have a feeling
you might want to see these.

506
00:28:07,637 --> 00:28:09,231
They're Jake's.

507
00:28:09,275 --> 00:28:11,746
You did it.

508
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,215
I always knew you would.

509
00:28:20,301 --> 00:28:21,736
Oh, Jake.

510
00:28:32,831 --> 00:28:34,460
I'm sorry.

511
00:28:34,501 --> 00:28:35,663
For what?

512
00:28:35,705 --> 00:28:38,074
For giving up on you.

513
00:28:38,143 --> 00:28:41,879
No one could be expected
to hold out hope for this long.

514
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,947
No, I-I-I should have
just kept trying

515
00:28:43,991 --> 00:28:47,295
to find you,
and I just went on with my life.

516
00:28:47,332 --> 00:28:50,499
And I'm proud
of what you've accomplished.

517
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:53,068
None of it matters

518
00:28:53,113 --> 00:28:56,349
now that I know that you're
out there lost somewhere.

519
00:28:57,858 --> 00:29:00,990
Of course it matters.

520
00:29:01,032 --> 00:29:03,230
You have a wife

521
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,173
a career.

522
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:08,238
And don't think
because I'm not around much

523
00:29:08,282 --> 00:29:11,654
that I...
don't want grandchildren.

524
00:29:20,144 --> 00:29:24,143
Within a few seconds,
he was gone again.

525
00:29:27,295 --> 00:29:29,732
I don't know what to say.

526
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:32,365
You don't have to say anything.

527
00:29:32,407 --> 00:29:36,143
Just listen,
because there isn't much time

528
00:29:36,249 --> 00:29:38,720
and there's so much more
for me to tell you.

529
00:29:38,755 --> 00:29:41,284
I consulted with Dax,
and we realized

530
00:29:41,328 --> 00:29:43,822
that the accident
must have created

531
00:29:43,868 --> 00:29:47,935
some sort of subspace link
between my father and myself.

532
00:29:47,978 --> 00:29:50,974
That's why he always appeared
somewhere near you

533
00:29:51,018 --> 00:29:53,046
even if you were hundreds
of light years away

534
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:55,288
from where
the accident happened.

535
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:58,130
We also realized that there was
a pattern to his appearances.

536
00:29:58,169 --> 00:30:00,402
They were governed
by fluctuations

537
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,536
in the wormhole subspace field.

538
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:06,213
Dax's calculations also showed
that the next time he appeared

539
00:30:06,288 --> 00:30:07,848
I'd be an old man.

540
00:30:07,892 --> 00:30:10,421
So, I decided
to put aside my novel

541
00:30:10,464 --> 00:30:12,662
and try to find a way
to help him.

542
00:30:12,703 --> 00:30:14,229
And at the age of 37

543
00:30:14,307 --> 00:30:17,474
I went back to school
and started studying

544
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,679
subspace mechanics.

545
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:25,166
At first,
Korena was very patient.

546
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,971
She supported
what I was trying to do

547
00:30:29,009 --> 00:30:31,446
but I got so caught up
in my work

548
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:33,952
I didn't notice
I was losing her.

549
00:30:33,988 --> 00:30:36,859
By the time I became
a graduate student

550
00:30:36,894 --> 00:30:39,526
we were no longer
living together

551
00:30:39,568 --> 00:30:42,541
and by the time I had entered
my doctoral program

552
00:30:42,575 --> 00:30:45,309
it was over between us.

553
00:30:45,415 --> 00:30:49,322
But I pressed on
with what I was doing

554
00:30:49,425 --> 00:30:51,419
and one day years later,
it hit me.

555
00:30:51,462 --> 00:30:54,196
I figured out a way
to recreate the accident.

556
00:30:54,236 --> 00:30:55,865
It had been almost 50 years

557
00:30:55,907 --> 00:31:00,578
and the wormhole would soon
be undergoing another inversion.

558
00:31:00,618 --> 00:31:03,648
There was only one other thing
I needed.

559
00:31:03,693 --> 00:31:06,291
The <i>Defiant.</i>

560
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,393
Nog was a Captain by then

561
00:31:08,437 --> 00:31:11,001
and he helped me round up
the old crew

562
00:31:11,043 --> 00:31:13,514
and get the ship pulled out
of mothballs.

563
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:19,091
Worf threw his weight around
with the Klingon High Council

564
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:23,002
and they gave us permission
to enter the Bajoran system.

565
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,510
Take us out of warp.

566
00:31:25,544 --> 00:31:28,676
I think I remember
how to do that.

567
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:31,122
I haven't worked
a two-dimensional control panel

568
00:31:31,158 --> 00:31:32,126
in a long time.

569
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,128
How did we manage?

570
00:31:33,163 --> 00:31:36,034
We always seemed
to muddle through somehow.

571
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,164
Look.

572
00:31:41,617 --> 00:31:44,215
Maybe after we've got
Captain Sisko back

573
00:31:44,256 --> 00:31:46,750
we can all stop by Morn's
for a drink.

574
00:31:46,796 --> 00:31:49,199
For old time's sake.

575
00:31:50,504 --> 00:31:55,414
I designed
a subspace flux isolator

576
00:31:55,483 --> 00:31:57,545
and we set it up in Engineering.

577
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,726
Are you ready over there, Dax?

578
00:32:01,765 --> 00:32:02,961
As ready as I'll ever be

579
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,905
considering the replicators
were just about the only things

580
00:32:05,942 --> 00:32:07,605
still working
when we came aboard.

581
00:32:07,645 --> 00:32:09,012
It's a lucky thing, too.

582
00:32:09,049 --> 00:32:11,077
Dax isn't any good
to anybody these days

583
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,387
without a cup of coffee
in her hands.

584
00:32:13,426 --> 00:32:14,793
It's the only thing
that's kept me awake

585
00:32:14,829 --> 00:32:17,734
while you've prattled on
about your latest paper

586
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,102
or your new backhand

587
00:32:19,139 --> 00:32:21,610
or your kids' science projects.

588
00:32:21,646 --> 00:32:23,309
We're picking up
temporal distortions

589
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,614
in the subspace field.

590
00:32:24,653 --> 00:32:26,783
The wormhole's
beginning to invert.

591
00:32:26,825 --> 00:32:28,226
According to our readings

592
00:32:28,262 --> 00:32:29,993
it's going to kick out
a gravimetric wave

593
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:32,435
like the one that almost
destroyed the <i>Defiant</i> last time.

594
00:32:32,539 --> 00:32:34,099
Don't worry,
I've modulated the shields

595
00:32:34,142 --> 00:32:36,636
to channel the energy wave
into this apparatus.

596
00:32:36,682 --> 00:32:38,550
Once subspace begins to fragment

597
00:32:38,586 --> 00:32:39,953
we'll try to locate the Captain.

598
00:32:39,989 --> 00:32:41,083
Since the accident

599
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,597
created a subspace link
between him and Jake

600
00:32:43,631 --> 00:32:45,795
there'll be a path
of bread crumbs to follow.

601
00:32:47,206 --> 00:32:49,609
I'd better get back
to the Bridge.

602
00:32:49,646 --> 00:32:50,636
Good luck.

603
00:32:55,894 --> 00:32:57,888
The wormhole wouldn't undergo

604
00:32:57,932 --> 00:33:03,901
another inversion for decades,
so this was my only chance.

605
00:33:08,056 --> 00:33:10,756
Subspace field fragmentation
is beginning.

606
00:33:10,796 --> 00:33:11,821
It's working.

607
00:33:14,773 --> 00:33:17,803
I think I've got
the Captain's signature.

608
00:33:24,964 --> 00:33:26,958
Something's happening.

609
00:33:27,002 --> 00:33:28,369
I'm losing him.

610
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:30,673
We're losing them both.

611
00:33:30,711 --> 00:33:32,648
They're being pulled
into subspace.

612
00:33:39,031 --> 00:33:42,665
Jake... how long has it been?

613
00:33:42,707 --> 00:33:45,076
14 years.

614
00:33:46,348 --> 00:33:48,045
What is this place?

615
00:33:48,086 --> 00:33:49,954
I don't know.

616
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:53,122
We could be inside some sort
of subspace fragment.

617
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,898
Sisko to Dax.

618
00:33:55,938 --> 00:33:58,375
Can you read me?

619
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:01,145
I brought the <i>Defiant</i> back
to the wormhole.

620
00:34:01,184 --> 00:34:03,178
We're trying to rescue you.

621
00:34:03,223 --> 00:34:07,256
Dax, if you can read me,
try to lock onto my signal.

622
00:34:07,298 --> 00:34:09,292
Look at you.

623
00:34:09,337 --> 00:34:12,971
You're older than I am.

624
00:34:14,415 --> 00:34:15,975
Damn it.

625
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:17,922
Why can't they lock onto us?

626
00:34:17,957 --> 00:34:21,295
Jake, they're doing
the best they can.

627
00:34:21,332 --> 00:34:24,271
There's nothing
we can do from here.

628
00:34:26,444 --> 00:34:28,073
It's been so long.

629
00:34:28,115 --> 00:34:30,586
I need to know what I've missed.

630
00:34:30,621 --> 00:34:35,531
What about those grandchildren
we talked about?

631
00:34:35,567 --> 00:34:39,805
Korena and I are...
We're no longer together.

632
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,179
She left me.

633
00:34:42,216 --> 00:34:44,119
I'm sorry.

634
00:34:44,154 --> 00:34:45,851
I shouldn't have let her go

635
00:34:45,891 --> 00:34:48,226
but there was
so much I had to do.

636
00:34:48,263 --> 00:34:50,564
This has taken years
of planning.

637
00:34:50,603 --> 00:34:52,733
What about your writing?

638
00:34:52,774 --> 00:34:56,613
Dax, try boosting
the carrier amplitude.

639
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:59,053
Maybe you can...

640
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:02,531
Jake, what's happened to you?

641
00:35:02,564 --> 00:35:06,437
This is the last chance
I'm ever going to have

642
00:35:06,474 --> 00:35:07,499
to help you.

643
00:35:07,542 --> 00:35:09,570
No!

644
00:35:09,614 --> 00:35:10,582
Jake, it's over.

645
00:35:10,617 --> 00:35:12,018
It's not going to work.

646
00:35:12,054 --> 00:35:13,044
It has to.

647
00:35:13,089 --> 00:35:14,923
Let go, Jake.

648
00:35:14,961 --> 00:35:18,299
If not for yourself,
then for me.

649
00:35:18,336 --> 00:35:22,369
You still have time to make
a better life for yourself.

650
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,440
Promise me you'll do that.

651
00:35:26,957 --> 00:35:28,256
Promise me!

652
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,926
I want you to see something.

653
00:36:06,962 --> 00:36:08,454
Go over to my desk.

654
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,834
Go ahead.

655
00:36:23,468 --> 00:36:26,168
It's a collection
of new stories.

656
00:36:26,207 --> 00:36:29,112
I decided
to honor my father's request

657
00:36:29,148 --> 00:36:31,085
and try to rebuild my life.

658
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,520
Writing those stories

659
00:36:32,622 --> 00:36:34,855
is the best way
I knew to do that.

660
00:36:34,895 --> 00:36:36,866
I'd like you to have a copy.

661
00:36:36,899 --> 00:36:38,927
Let me get you one.

662
00:36:38,971 --> 00:36:40,133
Um...

663
00:36:40,174 --> 00:36:42,236
can I have these instead?

664
00:36:42,279 --> 00:36:43,269
Well, if you'd like

665
00:36:43,315 --> 00:36:45,844
but those have handwritten notes
all over them.

666
00:36:45,888 --> 00:36:46,856
I know.

667
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:47,858
I want to study them

668
00:36:47,893 --> 00:36:49,556
so I can see
the changes you made.

669
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:53,366
Because you want to be
a writer someday.

670
00:36:56,112 --> 00:36:59,176
Can I ask you why you
haven't published these?

671
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,519
Well, I...

672
00:37:00,556 --> 00:37:04,429
I was tinkering with the last
story just this morning.

673
00:37:04,466 --> 00:37:06,960
Besides, if you
publish posthumously

674
00:37:07,005 --> 00:37:09,272
nobody can ask you
for rewrites.

675
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:12,113
I was hoping to finish
another two stories

676
00:37:12,151 --> 00:37:14,554
but there isn't enough time.

677
00:37:14,657 --> 00:37:18,291
You keep on saying
there's no more time.

678
00:37:19,335 --> 00:37:20,497
You see, Melanie

679
00:37:20,537 --> 00:37:24,103
after the last attempt
to rescue my father failed

680
00:37:24,146 --> 00:37:27,244
I spent months trying
to figure out what went wrong.

681
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:29,224
Eventually, I came
to understand the nature

682
00:37:29,259 --> 00:37:30,592
of what was happening to him.

683
00:37:30,628 --> 00:37:33,099
It was as if he
was frozen in time

684
00:37:33,134 --> 00:37:35,264
at the moment of the accident

685
00:37:35,306 --> 00:37:38,143
and the link between us
was like an elastic cord.

686
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:41,017
Every so often, the cord
would grow taut enough

687
00:37:41,053 --> 00:37:43,422
to yank him forward
into my time

688
00:37:43,459 --> 00:37:45,988
but only for a few minutes.

689
00:37:46,032 --> 00:37:47,433
I realized that

690
00:37:47,469 --> 00:37:50,101
if my motion through time
came to a stop

691
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,634
the cord would go slack

692
00:37:51,746 --> 00:37:54,081
and he'd be lost
in subspace forever

693
00:37:54,118 --> 00:37:56,089
but if I could cut the cord

694
00:37:56,123 --> 00:37:57,888
when the link
was at its strongest...

695
00:37:57,927 --> 00:37:59,089
while we were together...

696
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,932
he'd return to the moment
of the accident.

697
00:38:06,147 --> 00:38:09,883
Your father's coming here,
isn't he?

698
00:38:09,922 --> 00:38:11,323
Soon.

699
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:14,697
Yes.

700
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:19,037
You're going to cut the cord,
aren't you?

701
00:38:26,028 --> 00:38:29,264
I want you
to promise me something.

702
00:38:31,675 --> 00:38:33,669
Anything.

703
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,274
While you're studying my stories

704
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:39,156
poke your head up
every once in a while.

705
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:40,684
Take a look around.

706
00:38:40,729 --> 00:38:43,999
See what's going on.

707
00:38:44,037 --> 00:38:47,808
It's life, Melanie.

708
00:38:47,846 --> 00:38:52,346
And you can miss it
if you don't open your eyes.

709
00:39:12,573 --> 00:39:14,703
Thank you...

710
00:39:14,778 --> 00:39:16,509
for everything.

711
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:31,884
It was a pleasure meeting you,
young lady.

712
00:40:52,379 --> 00:40:53,871
Jake.

713
00:41:03,873 --> 00:41:05,604
Mmm...

714
00:41:05,643 --> 00:41:08,616
I've been expecting you.

715
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:15,433
I'm glad to see
you're still in this house.

716
00:41:15,467 --> 00:41:18,668
You seemed happy here.

717
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:22,080
And this...

718
00:41:24,088 --> 00:41:26,925
I-I can't tell you how good

719
00:41:26,961 --> 00:41:30,299
it makes me feel
you got back to writing.

720
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:35,147
Jake, what is it?

721
00:41:36,484 --> 00:41:38,044
Read the dedication.

722
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:46,134
"To my father...

723
00:41:46,174 --> 00:41:48,509
who's coming home."

724
00:41:54,293 --> 00:41:56,024
Thank you, but I...

725
00:41:56,131 --> 00:41:57,896
I don't understand.

726
00:41:57,935 --> 00:42:00,406
It was me.

727
00:42:00,442 --> 00:42:03,347
It was me all along.

728
00:42:03,382 --> 00:42:07,255
I've been dragging you
through time like an anchor

729
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:10,059
and now it's time
to cut you loose.

730
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:14,199
Jake, what are you saying?

731
00:42:28,074 --> 00:42:30,842
It won't be long now.

732
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,544
Jake, no!

733
00:42:36,896 --> 00:42:41,806
When I die, you'll go back
to where this all began.

734
00:42:41,841 --> 00:42:46,876
Just remember
to dodge the energy discharge

735
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,480
from the warp core.

736
00:42:48,523 --> 00:42:54,094
Jake, you could still have
so many years left.

737
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:55,332
No.

738
00:42:55,373 --> 00:42:59,109
We have to be together
when I die.

739
00:43:00,284 --> 00:43:05,662
Jake, you didn't have
to do this...

740
00:43:05,698 --> 00:43:08,169
not for me.

741
00:43:08,203 --> 00:43:13,774
For you and for the boy
that I was.

742
00:43:13,817 --> 00:43:16,288
He needs you...

743
00:43:16,323 --> 00:43:18,385
more than you know.

744
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,334
Don't you see?

745
00:43:21,369 --> 00:43:25,971
We're going to get a second...

746
00:43:27,316 --> 00:43:29,378
chance.

747
00:43:33,932 --> 00:43:35,265
Jake...

748
00:43:36,973 --> 00:43:39,342
my sweet boy.

749
00:43:51,774 --> 00:43:53,266
You okay?

750
00:43:53,311 --> 00:43:55,875
H-How'd you know
that was coming?

751
00:43:55,918 --> 00:44:00,794
I guess we were just
lucky this time.

752
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,810
You okay, Dad?

753
00:44:12,659 --> 00:44:14,322
I am now, Jake.

754
00:44:19,208 --> 00:44:20,871
I am now.
