(<i> rain pattering</i> )

2
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:08,926
(<i> thunder rumbling</i> )

3
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,840
(<i> door chimes</i> )

4
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,938
May I help you?

5
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:05,232
I'm sorry to bother you.

6
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:08,027
I just, um... been...

7
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:09,236
You're hurt.

8
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,738
Yeah, I must have

9
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,239
scraped myself
on a branch.

10
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,867
Ah, that's what happens
when you go tromping

11
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,827
around the bayou
in the middle of the night.

12
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,162
Come on, warm yourself up
by the fire.

13
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:23,500
Now, I have a first aid kit
around here somewhere.

14
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,126
Where is it?

15
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:28,714
So, what are you
doing out here anyway?

16
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:31,466
I'm a writer.

17
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,844
At least I want to be.

18
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:37,890
And the truth is...

19
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,725
I was looking for you.

20
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:41,727
Oh?

21
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,645
You are Jake Sisko, the writer?

22
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,855
Yes.

23
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,276
I can't believe
I'm really here...

24
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,028
talking to you.

25
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,321
You are my favorite author

26
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,698
of all time.

27
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,576
You should read more.

28
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:58,786
I mean it.

29
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:02,790
Your books, they're so...
insightful.

30
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,084
I'm glad you like them.

31
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:06,877
There.

32
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,045
Good as new.

33
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,463
Thank you.

34
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:12,049
I didn't realize people
still read my books.

35
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,093
Of course they do.

36
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:16,053
A friend recommended
<i>Anslem</i> to me,

37
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:19,098
and I read it straight through
twice in one night.

38
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:21,224
Twice in one night?

39
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,852
It made me want to read
everything you'd ever written,

40
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,270
but when I looked,

41
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,814
all I could find
was your<i> Collected Stories.</i>

42
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,899
I couldn't believe it.

43
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:32,527
I'd finally found someone
whose writing I really admired,

44
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:35,114
and he'd only published
two books.

45
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:36,323
Not much to show

46
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,241
for a life's
work, is it?

47
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,536
I'm going to go
get us some tea.

48
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,749
I savored those stories.

49
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,126
I read them slowly,
one each day,

50
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:48,460
and when I was done,

51
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,295
I wished I hadn't
read them at all.

52
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,257
So I could read them again
like it was the first time.

53
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,717
There's only

54
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,971
one first time
for everything, isn't there?

55
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:02,516
And only one last time, too.

56
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:06,854
You think about such things
when you get to be my age.

57
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:10,983
That today may
be the last time

58
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:13,152
you sit in your
favorite chair

59
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:15,696
or watch the rain fall

60
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,156
or enjoy

61
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:20,117
a cup of tea
by a warm fire.

62
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,664
Can I ask you something?

63
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,833
Of course.

64
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,710
Why did you stop writing?

65
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,839
I lost my favorite pen,

66
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,591
and I couldn't get
any work done without it.

67
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,055
You're joking.

68
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:45,392
You weren't even 40
when you stopped writing.

69
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,228
I never understood
why you gave it up.

70
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,274
It's a long story.

71
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,694
I have time.

72
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,405
Tell me.

73
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,657
Please.

74
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:10,584
If you had shown up yesterday

75
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,420
or the day before or a week ago,

76
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,966
I would have said no
and sent you on your way,

77
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:23,471
but here you are,
today of all days,

78
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,558
and somehow
it seems like

79
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:30,854
the right time for me
to finally tell this story.

80
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:41,949
It begins many years ago.

81
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,451
I was 18,

82
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:49,831
and the worst thing
that could happen to a young man

83
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,374
happened to me.

84
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,380
My father died.

85
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:10,097
We were very close,
my father and I,

86
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:13,725
partly because
we'd lost my mother

87
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,769
several years earlier.

88
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,520
I know.

89
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,773
I read a biography
about you.

90
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,608
It said that you
stopped writing

91
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,944
so you could conduct
scientific research.

92
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:27,072
Ah, it's not quite
that simple.

93
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,657
You see, just before
my father died,

94
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,701
I was working
on a short story.

95
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,829
I don't remember
what it was about,

96
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,791
but I do know that I was
taking it very seriously.

97
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,086
I worked on it night
and day for weeks,

98
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,797
and I wasn't making
any headway.

99
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,757
It was making me miserable.

100
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,593
I suppose my father saw
that I needed a break,

101
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,178
<i>because he insisted</i>

102
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,722
<i>I come with him</i>
<i>to the Gamma Quadrant</i>

103
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,515
<i>to watch the wormhole</i>
<i>undergo</i>

104
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,935
<i>what they call</i>
<i>"a subspace inversion."</i>

105
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,728
Jake-o, let's go.

106
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,275
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>what he didn't realize</i>

107
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:06,069
<i>was that I could hide away</i>
<i>on the</i> Defiant

108
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:09,114
<i>just as easily</i>
<i>as I could on the station.</i>

109
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,157
(<i> door chimes</i> )

110
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,366
Yeah?

111
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:16,037
Jake, this only happens
once every 50 years.

112
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,748
You will never forgive
yourself if you miss it.

113
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,459
Yeah, I'll be right there.

114
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,210
Well, that's what you said
ten minutes ago.

115
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,629
I just want to get this
last paragraph right.

116
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,007
I thought you were going
to put that aside for a while.

117
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,759
I tried, but it's all
I can think about.

118
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,888
Well... I'm no writer,

119
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,016
but if I were,

120
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,435
it seems to me I'd want
to poke my head up

121
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,979
every once in a while
and take a look around,

122
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,189
see what's going on.

123
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,690
It's life, Jake.

124
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,943
You can miss it if you
don't open your eyes.

125
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:50,780
Now... what do you say

126
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,366
you come up to
the Bridge with me

127
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,951
and we'll watch the
wormhole do its thing.

128
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,037
And then I'll read
what you've got,

129
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,538
and we'll talk about it.

130
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,040
Deal?

131
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,749
Deal.

132
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:04,461
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

133
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:05,504
Sisko to Bridge.

134
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:06,963
What happened?

135
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,256
The wormhole's gravimetric field
is surging.

136
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,008
SISKO:
Pull us to a safe distance.

137
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,052
I'm on it, Benjamin,
but we've got another problem.

138
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,845
The power output
from the warp core

139
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:14,929
just jumped off the scale.

140
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,890
Sisko to Engineering.

141
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,558
Engineering, report.

142
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:22,270
Dax, I'm going to see
what's going on down there.

143
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,438
Stay here, Jake.

144
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,860
OLD JAKE:<i> Most of the time,</i>
<i>I knew enough</i>

145
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,862
<i>to do what my father told me,</i>

146
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:33,656
<i>but that day, for some reason,</i>
<i>I didn't.</i>

147
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,910
Sisko to Sick Bay.

148
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,703
I need a medical team
down here right away.

149
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,247
Dax to Sisko.

150
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,707
The warp coils are locked
into a feedback loop.

151
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,544
You've got to realign them
or the core is going to blow.

152
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:47,379
I'm on it!

153
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,967
Jake, I need
an interphasic compensator.

154
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:57,597
COMPUTER:
Warning. Warp core breach
in 40 seconds.

155
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:01,101
Dax, better stand by
to eject the core.

156
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,310
DAX:
We can't.

157
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,396
The ejection system's off line.

158
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,192
Jake, where's that compensator?

159
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,319
It's not here!

160
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,864
COMPUTER:
Warning. Warp core breach
in 30 seconds.

161
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,908
Got it.

162
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,961
I'm going to try shunting
the excess power out through

163
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,588
the deflector array.

164
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:32,382
COMPUTER:
Warning. Warp core breach
in 20 seconds.

165
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,384
Just a little more.

166
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,306
There.

167
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,603
(<i> yells</i> )

168
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:51,901
No!

169
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,404
<i>He was gone.</i>

170
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,698
I'm not sure I could
ever get over

171
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:02,787
losing somebody like that
right in front of my eyes.

172
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,705
People do.

173
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,666
Time passes,

174
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,876
and they realize that
the person they lost

175
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,045
is really gone...

176
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,839
and they heal.

177
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,133
Is that what happened
to you?

178
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:18,719
No.

179
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:22,140
I suppose not.

180
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,352
There was a memorial service
aboard the station.

181
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:30,231
<i>People came forward</i>
<i>and talked about my father--</i>

182
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,651
<i>what they remembered</i>
<i>most about him</i>

183
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:35,654
<i>and why they would miss him.</i>

184
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:37,905
Benjamin Sisko

185
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:41,868
was more than
my commanding officer.

186
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:45,288
He was the Emissary
to my people

187
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,873
sent by the Prophets,

188
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:51,419
but most importantly,
he was my friend.

189
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,005
OLD JAKE:
<i>I didn't step forward.</i>

190
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,798
<i>I couldn't.</i>

191
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,259
<i>I felt that no matter</i>
<i>what I said about him,</i>

192
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,679
<i>I'd be leaving</i>
<i>so much more out,</i>

193
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,514
<i>and that didn't seem right.</i>

194
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:06,685
<i>I'd never felt more alone</i>
<i>in all my life.</i>

195
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:09,437
<i>Everyone went out of their way</i>
<i>to look after me,</i>

196
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,606
<i>especially Dax.</i>

197
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,108
<i>She was my father's</i>
<i>closest friend,</i>

198
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,404
<i>and I guess she felt</i>
<i>responsible for me.</i>

199
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,077
<i>After a few months, things</i>
<i>started returning to normal...</i>

200
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,454
<i>for everyone else, that is.</i>

201
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,998
Jake, I'm almost done.

202
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,875
We have Holosuite 3
for half an hour.

203
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,001
Great.

204
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,378
Nog, get down
to the storeroom

205
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,672
and bring up five kegs
of Takarian mead.

206
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,006
Yes, Uncle.

207
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,092
Sorry, looks like

208
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,094
we're going to lose
our holosuite reservation.

209
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:45,599
Uh, you know, Nog, things seem
to be slowing down a bit.

210
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,308
I'll get someone else
to bring up those kegs.

211
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,436
You and Jake
go and have some fun.

212
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,604
Are you sure?

213
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:53,648
Go now, before
I change my mind.

214
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,031
Next time
we go ion surfing,

215
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,782
remind me to keep clear
of those whip curls.

216
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:06,119
I don't know if I really
want to try it again.

217
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:09,623
You know, Jake,
I'm going to be gone soon.

218
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,041
We probably won't
see each other for a while.

219
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,460
I know.

220
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,379
So, what are your plans?

221
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,589
Well, I was thinking

222
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,633
of taking that
deferred admission

223
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,009
and going to Pennington
in the fall.

224
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,470
Ah, that would be great!

225
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,887
We'd both be
on Earth together.

226
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,599
But maybe I'll just
stick around here.

227
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:30,059
I don't know.
I haven't decided yet.

228
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,314
It's late.

229
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,565
I think I'll turn in.

230
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,191
Okay.

231
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,081
(<i> electric crackling</i> )

232
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,333
(<i> whooshing</i> )

233
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,298
Jake.

234
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,216
Dad?

235
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,053
What happened?

236
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,138
(<i> whooshing</i> )

237
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,691
I told Dax
about what had happened--

238
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,192
how it felt so real,

239
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,444
not like a dream at all.

240
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:24,739
And she very kindly
obliged me and did

241
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,783
a very thorough scan of my room.

242
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:31,120
I felt vaguely ridiculous,
like a child insisting

243
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,915
his parents check under
the bed for monsters.

244
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,585
She tried to tell me it was
probably just a nightmare,

245
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,961
and I did my best

246
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,881
to put the entire
episode out of my mind.

247
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,758
I puttered around the station

248
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,885
for the next eight
or nine months.

249
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,513
Nog was off at Starfleet.

250
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:52,099
My stories stubbornly refused
to write themselves.

251
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,394
I filled my time playing dom-jot

252
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:58,189
and tried not to think
about how alone I really felt.

253
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:01,442
Dax and the others
were worried about me,

254
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:05,780
<i>but before long, they had</i>
<i>bigger things to worry about.</i>

255
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,743
<i>Tensions with the Klingons</i>
<i>were continuing to rise.</i>

256
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:12,704
<i>My father was</i>
<i>a kind of religious figure</i>

257
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:15,456
<i>to the Bajoran people,</i>
<i>and when he died,</i>

258
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,917
<i>they took it as a sign</i>
<i>from the Prophets</i>

259
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,753
<i>that the Federation</i>
<i>wouldn't be able</i>

260
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,713
<i>to protect them</i>
<i>from the Klingons.</i>

261
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:24,965
<i>Eventually, Bajor entered</i>
<i>into a mutual defense pact</i>

262
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,676
<i>with the Cardassians,</i>

263
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:31,138
<i>and the Klingons</i>
<i>didn't like that at all.</i>

264
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,473
<i>The station's</i>
<i>civilian population</i>

265
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,267
<i>was leaving en masse.</i>

266
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,811
<i>They knew that if war broke out</i>
<i>against the Klingons,</i>

267
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:40,899
<i>Deep Space 9 was going</i>
<i>to be on the front line.</i>

268
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,403
KIRA:
Jake.

269
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,572
Where are you going?

270
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,490
I, uh, I thought I'd watch
the ships leave

271
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,033
from one of the Upper Pylons.

272
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,993
You should be<i> on</i>
one of those ships.

273
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:53,994
(<i> sighs</i> )

274
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,288
I don't have to go, do I?

275
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,790
No.

276
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,332
It's a voluntary
resettlement,

277
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,918
not an evacuation.

278
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,169
But it would be prudent
that you leave at this time.

279
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:05,590
OLD JAKE:
<i>I suppose I wasn't feeling</i>

280
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,592
<i>very prudent that day,</i>

281
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,928
<i>because I ignored their advice.</i>

282
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,471
KIRA:
Jake...

283
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,224
I wanted to talk
to you about something.

284
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,226
I spoke
with your grandfather,

285
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,146
and he told me that he
asked you to go live with him.

286
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:23,524
(<i> sighing</i> )

287
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,778
Even if this sector
weren't on the brink of war,

288
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,988
I would like to see you
leave this station.

289
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,324
I'm not going anywhere.

290
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,826
Oh, Jake...

291
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,622
I could order you to go
if I wanted to.

292
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,960
Please don't
make me leave.

293
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,837
Not yet.

294
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,379
This is my home.

295
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,884
When my dad
and I came here,

296
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,720
this place was just
an abandoned shell.

297
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,306
He turned it
into something.

298
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:00,770
Everywhere I look, it's
like I see a part of him.

299
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,985
If I leave...

300
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:09,779
I won't have
anything left of him.

301
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,576
Oh...

302
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,077
all right.

303
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:20,206
You stay a while longer
if you want to,

304
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,041
but you have to promise me,

305
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:26,629
when the time comes
and I tell you to go,

306
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,255
you'll do it.

307
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,226
(<i> whooshing</i> )

308
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,359
Dad?

309
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:54,114
<i>It wasn't</i>
<i>until I actually touched him</i>

310
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:58,077
<i>that I knew</i>
<i>this wasn't a dream.</i>

311
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:01,539
<i>But something was wrong.</i>

312
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:04,042
<i>I didn't understand</i>
<i>everything they were saying,</i>

313
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:06,252
<i>but Dax and the others seemed</i>
<i>to think that the accident</i>

314
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,922
<i>had somehow knocked</i>
<i>my father's temporal signature</i>

315
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,464
<i>out of phase.</i>

316
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,508
Benjamin, what's the last
thing you remember?

317
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,094
I was in Engineering,
on the<i> Defiant.</i>

318
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,930
It feels like a few minutes ago.

319
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,016
Dad, it's been over a year
since the accident.

320
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,350
A year?

321
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,977
How could that be?

322
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,645
O'BRIEN: We think
the warp core discharge

323
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,564
pulled you into subspace.

324
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,107
If we're right,
that would explain

325
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,901
why you didn't experience
the passage of time.

326
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,569
According to
these readings,

327
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,195
unless we can realign
your temporal signature,

328
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,739
you'll be pulled

329
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,575
back into subspace again
within the next few minutes.

330
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:40,703
Maybe we can set up some
sort of containment field.

331
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:44,707
Jake, they'll have me
fixed up in no time.

332
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,417
How are you doing?

333
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,176
It's all right.

334
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:59,764
Everything's going
to be all right.

335
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,686
I thought it was a dream.

336
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,773
What was?

337
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:14,236
When I, uh, when I saw you
in my quarters,

338
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:17,865
I, uh... I should have
felt you were alive.

339
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,993
I should have known it.

340
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,911
It's not your fault, Jake.

341
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,122
I'm here now.

342
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:25,915
That's what matters.

343
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,751
DAX:
We're losing him.

344
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:31,921
Look at me.

345
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,674
I need to know
you're going to be all right.

346
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,093
O'BRIEN: His temporal
signature is fluctuating.

347
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,512
I need that containment
field now, Chief.

348
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,680
O'BRIEN:
Right away.

349
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,222
Field active.

350
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,935
It's not working.

351
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,269
Jake...

352
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,187
Dad!

353
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,647
O'BRIEN:
Going to try

354
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:50,857
locking on to him
with the transporter beam.

355
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,818
Don't leave me!

356
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,864
(<i> whispers</i> ):
Don't leave me.

357
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,288
I didn't think
anything could be worse

358
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:09,834
than losing him that first time
on the<i> Defiant,</i>

359
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,170
until I was standing there,

360
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,214
staring down
at his empty bed,

361
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,801
knowing he was alive,

362
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,095
yet trapped somewhere

363
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:24,598
that existed outside of time.

364
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:30,188
I can't imagine what that
must have been like for you.

365
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:31,605
(<i> gasping</i> )

366
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,357
Can I get you something?

367
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,442
No... nothing.

368
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,736
Telling me all this
is hard for you.

369
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,446
Maybe I should come back
some other time.

370
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:42,783
No. There won't be
any other time.

371
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,244
You see...

372
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,621
I'm dying.

373
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,297
You must understand

374
00:20:57,297 --> 00:21:00,634
that when a person
my age says he's dying,

375
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,054
he's only admitting
to the inevitable.

376
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:07,225
Besides, we old people
need to remind everyone

377
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:09,727
to pay special
attention to us.

378
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:13,981
If that's what you're up to,
you shouldn't have bothered.

379
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:18,111
You have my attention already.

380
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:19,779
You're a good listener.

381
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,989
That's important
in a writer.

382
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:25,576
I'm not a writer yet.

383
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,828
Sounds like you're waiting
for something to happen

384
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,329
that's going to
turn you into one.

385
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,957
I'm not waiting.

386
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm doing a lot of reading,

387
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,169
you know, to see
how it's done,

388
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:38,005
and I'm still trying
to figure out

389
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,548
what it is
I want to write about.

390
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,925
I see.

391
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,637
So what happened?

392
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,222
With your father, I mean.

393
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,015
Did you ever see him again?

394
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,767
For the next few months,

395
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:53,479
Dax and O'Brien tried to
find a way to locate him.

396
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:57,066
They even considered
recreating the accident,

397
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:59,152
but that was impossible
since the wormhole

398
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:02,696
wasn't going to undergo
an inversion for decades.

399
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:06,450
Eventually the situation with
the Klingons came to a head,

400
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,078
and the Federation
decided to turn over

401
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:12,915
control of the station
to the Klingon Empire.

402
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:16,252
<i>There was nothing I could do.</i>

403
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:19,672
<i>I had to leave my home</i>
<i>of five years</i>

404
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,175
<i>and give up</i>
<i>whatever hope there was</i>

405
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:25,511
<i>of seeing my father again.</i>

406
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:26,804
Did the Klingons
ever contact Starfleet

407
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,472
to say that your father
had reappeared?

408
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,432
No.

409
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,643
I was left
with no choice

410
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:35,771
but to try and get
on with my life.

411
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:39,900
I went to Earth,
drifted around,

412
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,944
and eventually ended up

413
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,738
studying writing at
the Pennington School.

414
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:49,702
After graduation, I settled
here in Louisiana

415
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,871
so I could be near
my grandfather.

416
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,623
He had a restaurant
in the French Quarter, you know.

417
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,708
I've been there.

418
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,543
It's still called Sisko's.

419
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:58,919
And on the wall, there's a copy

420
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,462
of the letter
your publisher sent you

421
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,131
when he accepted
your first novel.

422
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:05,843
Grandpa was always showing off
his famous grandson.

423
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:09,930
He was just as proud of me
as my father would have been.

424
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:14,685
You wrote<i> Anslem</i> in this house,
didn't you?

425
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:17,104
At that desk, right over there.

426
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:20,691
It came out to generally
favorable reviews,

427
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,109
and little by little,

428
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,071
I began to think less and less
about the past.

429
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:28,908
After a while, I met a woman...

430
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,368
fell in love,

431
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:33,579
we got married,
and for a while,
this house was

432
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,206
a happy one.

433
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:36,749
WOMAN:
<i>I'm back!</i>

434
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,001
Nog!

435
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,794
I didn't realize
you were here already.

436
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,588
I was trying
to finish a painting

437
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:43,839
before the light changed,

438
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,716
and I guess the time
got away from me.

439
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:46,800
It's good to see you.

440
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,801
You, too.

441
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:48,886
Did you start the grill?

442
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:49,929
Mm-hmm.

443
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,264
Oh, what are we having?

444
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:53,182
Blackened redfish,
fresh from the bayou.

445
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,767
Fish?!

446
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,228
When these woods are crawling
with perfectly good slugs?

447
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:59,355
I suppose you're going to ask me
to chew your food for you.

448
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:00,898
(<i> laughs</i> )

449
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,983
I have to admit I've been
more popular with women

450
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,818
since I stopped
asking them to do that.

451
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,695
I tried to tell you
that 20 years ago.

452
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:07,780
I'm a slow learner.

453
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,865
I'm going to get some champagne.

454
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,325
I'm glad you're here, Nog.

455
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,119
I see you've got another
pip on your collar.

456
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,037
You keep that up, you're
going to make Captain

457
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,330
by the time you're 40.

458
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,831
The last time we talked,
you mentioned

459
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,833
you might be heading back
to the Bajoran sector.

460
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,794
(<i> sighs</i> )

461
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,879
The Klingons agreed
to let Starfleet

462
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,299
send an expedition
through the wormhole.

463
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,801
They said it was in the spirit
of scientific exchange.

464
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,803
But I think they were happy
to have us test the waters

465
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,638
in the Gamma Quadrant
after all these years.

466
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,723
Find out how
the Dominion would react

467
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,975
to ships coming through.

468
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,768
Did you see the station?

469
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,898
I'm sorry to say it's looking
a little run-down these days.

470
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,693
But you'll never guess
who's still there.

471
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:47,945
Not your father?

472
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:50,156
No, no. He and my uncle
left years ago.

473
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,698
Quark finally
got that little moon

474
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:52,908
he was always talking about,

475
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,535
and my father, as usual,
is making sure

476
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,537
it doesn't fall
out of orbit,

477
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:01,499
but Morn is still there,
running the bar.

478
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,210
Talking his
customers' ears off

479
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,379
and drinking himself out
of business, I'll bet.

480
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:07,631
Well, why don't we
get to the point

481
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,300
of today's
little celebration?

482
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,889
To my dear friend
Jake Sisko--

483
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,975
winner of this year's
Betar Prize

484
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,393
for his<i> Collected Stories.</i>

485
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:22,813
May the years continue
to be good to you,

486
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:26,733
may your muse continue
to inspire you,

487
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,902
and may someone
make a holoprogram

488
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,237
out of
one of your stories

489
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,031
so you can start
raking in the latinum.

490
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,324
(<i> all chuckling</i> )

491
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:38,329
(<i> gasping</i> )

492
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:39,372
Are you all right?

493
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:40,706
Do you want me to call a doctor?

494
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,709
No.

495
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,336
I'll be fine.

496
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:47,421
You should rest.

497
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:48,922
No, you came a long way

498
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,425
to find out why I
had stopped writing,

499
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:53,635
and you deserve an answer.

500
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,889
<i>Later that night,</i>
<i>after Nog had left,</i>

501
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:59,641
<i>I stayed up working.</i>

502
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,727
<i>My new novel was going well,</i>

503
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:05,314
<i>and when it's going well,</i>
<i>you don't want to stop.</i>

504
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:09,860
Coming to bed?

505
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,239
Um...I'm not tired.

506
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:18,452
Neither am I.

507
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:34,301
You know, I-I wanted
to ask you something.

508
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,887
How would you feel
about designing the cover

509
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,389
of my new book?

510
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,350
Do you mean it?

511
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,227
(<i> whooshing</i> )

512
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:45,020
What was that?

513
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:57,908
Jake?

514
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,748
Did you get through?

515
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,500
I talked to someone
at Starfleet Science.

516
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,668
They're going to get a team
here as soon as they can.

517
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:12,965
This is Korena, my wife.

518
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:17,970
Your wife?

519
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,680
I never thought I'd have
the pleasure of meeting you.

520
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,641
The pleasure is mine.

521
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:26,145
How long have you two
been married?

522
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,605
Seven years.

523
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:29,482
Do I have
any grandchildren?

524
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:30,441
Not yet.

525
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:31,900
We were married

526
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,487
in New Orleans
in your father's restaurant.

527
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:35,862
He insisted.

528
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,781
Just about everybody came.

529
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,866
Dax, Kira, O'Brien.

530
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:42,453
That must have been
something.

531
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:44,830
I got to go
call Starfleet.

532
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,124
Whoa.

533
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:49,251
They'll get here
as soon as they can.

534
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:50,544
Talk to me.

535
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,129
I've missed so much.

536
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:54,672
Let's not waste
what little time we have.

537
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:56,175
I have a feeling

538
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:59,052
you might want
to see these.

539
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,517
They're Jake's.

540
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:06,977
You did it.

541
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:08,479
I always knew
you would.

542
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,274
(<i> crying</i> )

543
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:16,862
Oh, Jake.

544
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,707
I'm sorry.

545
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:30,626
For what?

546
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:33,253
For giving
up on you.

547
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,882
No one could be expected
to hold out hope for this long.

548
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,134
No, I-I-I should have
just kept trying

549
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:42,346
to find you,
and I just went on with my life.

550
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:45,724
And I'm proud
of what you've accomplished.

551
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,060
None of it matters

552
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,564
now that I know that you're
out there lost somewhere.

553
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:56,109
Of course it matters.

554
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,445
You have a wife,

555
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,239
a career.

556
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:03,325
And don't think
because I'm not around much

557
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:06,995
that I...
don't want grandchildren.

558
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,214
OLD JAKE:
<i>Within a few seconds,</i>

559
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,383
he was gone again.

560
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,888
I don't know what to say.

561
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,474
You don't have to say anything.

562
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:31,353
Just listen,
because there isn't much time,

563
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:33,855
and there's so much more
for me to tell you.

564
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,400
I consulted with Dax,
and we realized

565
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,818
that the accident
must have created

566
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:42,948
some sort of subspace link
between my father and myself.

567
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:45,992
That's why he always appeared
somewhere near you,

568
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,078
even if you were hundreds
of light years away

569
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:50,414
from where
the accident happened.

570
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:53,208
We also realized that there was
a pattern to his appearances.

571
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,628
They were governed
by fluctuations

572
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:57,546
in the wormhole subspace field.

573
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,465
Dax's calculations
also showed

574
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:01,300
that the next time
he appeared,

575
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,801
I'd be an old man.

576
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,512
So I decided
to put aside my novel

577
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,889
and try to find a way
to help him.

578
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,266
And at the age of 37,

579
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:12,561
I went back to school
and started studying

580
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,854
subspace mechanics.

581
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:20,193
At first,
Korena was very patient.

582
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:23,905
She supported
what I was trying to do,

583
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,492
but I got so caught up
in my work,

584
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:29,035
I didn't notice
I was losing her.

585
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,830
By the time I became
a graduate student,

586
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,500
we were no longer
living together,

587
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,795
and by the time I had entered
my doctoral program,

588
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:40,506
it was over between us.

589
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:44,510
But I pressed on
with what I was doing,

590
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,470
and one day years later,
it hit me.

591
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,596
I figured out a way

592
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:49,222
to recreate
the accident.

593
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,725
It had been
almost 50 years

594
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:55,688
and the wormhole would soon
be undergoing another inversion.

595
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:58,691
There was only one other thing
I needed.

596
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:01,527
<i>The</i> Defiant.

597
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:03,570
<i>Nog was a Captain by then,</i>

598
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,031
<i>and he helped me round up</i>
<i>the old crew</i>

599
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,325
<i>and get the ship pulled out</i>
<i>of mothballs.</i>

600
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,414
<i>Worf threw his weight around</i>
<i>with the Klingon High Council,</i>

601
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:17,459
<i>and they gave us permission</i>
<i>to enter the Bajoran system.</i>

602
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,504
Take us out of warp.

603
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:23,632
I think I remember
how to do that.

604
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,801
I haven't worked
a two-dimensional control panel

605
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:26,802
in a long time.

606
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,094
How did we manage?

607
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,848
We always seemed
to muddle through somehow.

608
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:32,057
Look.

609
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:39,022
Maybe after we've got
Captain Sisko back,

610
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,734
we can all stop by Morn's
for a drink.

611
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:43,652
For old
time's sake.

612
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:50,325
OLD JAKE:<i> I designed</i>
<i>a subspace flux isolator,</i>

613
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,578
<i>and we set it up</i>
<i>in Engineering.</i>

614
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,206
Are you ready
over there, Dax?

615
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,957
As ready
as I'll ever be,

616
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:01,044
considering the replicators
were just about the only things

617
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,421
still working
when we came aboard.

618
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:03,797
It's a lucky thing, too.

619
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:06,007
Dax isn't any good
to anybody these days

620
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,301
without a cup of coffee
in her hands.

621
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,845
It's the only thing
that's kept me awake

622
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:12,681
while you've prattled on
about your latest paper

623
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:13,891
or your new backhand

624
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:16,518
or your kids'
science projects.

625
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,270
NOG: We're picking up
temporal distortions

626
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,605
in the subspace field.

627
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,732
The wormhole's
beginning to invert.

628
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:23,066
According to our readings,

629
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,860
it's going to kick out
a gravimetric wave

630
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,237
like the one that almost
destroyed the<i> Defiant</i> last time.

631
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:28,906
Don't worry, I've
modulated the shields

632
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:31,533
to channel the energy wave
into this apparatus.

633
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,410
Once subspace begins
to fragment,

634
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,494
we'll try to locate
the Captain.

635
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,954
BASHIR:
Since the accident

636
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,457
created a subspace link
between him and Jake,

637
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,834
there'll be a path of
bread crumbs to follow.

638
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,001
(<i> rumbling</i> )

639
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,504
I'd better get back
to the Bridge.

640
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,672
Good luck.

641
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:52,763
OLD JAKE:
<i>The wormhole wouldn't undergo</i>

642
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:58,977
<i>another inversion for decades,</i>
<i>so this was my only chance.</i>

643
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:05,734
Subspace field fragmentation
is beginning.

644
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:06,902
It's working.

645
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,030
DAX:
I think I've got

646
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,699
the Captain's signature.

647
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,000
Something's happening.

648
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,251
I'm losing him.

649
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,336
We're losing

650
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:25,587
them both.

651
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,506
They're being pulled
into subspace.

652
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,641
Jake... how long
has it been?

653
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:40,143
14 years.

654
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:43,021
What is this place?

655
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,940
I don't know.

656
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,943
We could be inside some sort
of subspace fragment.

657
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:50,779
Sisko to Dax.

658
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:53,114
Can you read me?

659
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,868
I brought the<i> Defiant</i> back
to the wormhole.

660
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:57,911
We're trying to rescue you.

661
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:02,040
Dax, if you can read me,
try to lock onto my signal.

662
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,125
Look at you.

663
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,754
You're older than I am.

664
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,008
Damn it.

665
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:12,801
Why can't they lock onto us?

666
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:16,095
Jake, they're doing
the best they can.

667
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:19,140
There's nothing
we can do from here.

668
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,978
It's been so long.

669
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:25,480
I need to know
what I've missed.

670
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,608
What about those
grandchildren

671
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,360
we talked about?

672
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,781
Korena and I are...
We're no longer together.

673
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,867
She left me.

674
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:39,036
I'm sorry.

675
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,579
I shouldn't have
let her go,

676
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,956
but there was
so much I had to do.

677
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:45,333
This has taken years
of planning.

678
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,419
What about your writing?

679
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:51,464
Dax, try boosting
the carrier amplitude.

680
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,926
Maybe you can...

681
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:57,262
Jake, what's
happened to you?

682
00:34:57,262 --> 00:35:01,307
This is the last chance
I'm ever going to have

683
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,392
to help you.

684
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,436
No!

685
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:05,395
Jake, it's over.

686
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:06,772
It's not going to work.

687
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:07,731
It has to.

688
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:09,816
Let go, Jake.

689
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:13,070
If not for yourself,
then for me.

690
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,113
You still have time to make

691
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,949
a better life
for yourself.

692
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,117
Promise me you'll do that.

693
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,871
Promise me!

694
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:32,798
(<i> whooshing</i> )

695
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:35,884
(<i> Jake sobbing</i> )

696
00:35:56,822 --> 00:36:00,366
I want you to see something.

697
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,910
Go over to my desk.

698
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,370
Go ahead.

699
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:19,427
It's a collection
of new stories.

700
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,139
I decided to honor
my father's request

701
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:24,390
and try to rebuild my life.

702
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,976
Writing those stories

703
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:28,186
is the best way
I knew to do that.

704
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,313
I'd like you to have a copy.

705
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,440
Let me get you one.

706
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,525
Um...

707
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,568
can I have these instead?

708
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,029
Well, if you'd like,

709
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:39,238
but those have handwritten notes
all over them.

710
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,198
I know.

711
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,407
I want to study them,

712
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,868
so I can see
the changes you made.

713
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:46,788
Because you want to be
a writer someday.

714
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:52,210
Can I ask you why you
haven't published these?

715
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,837
Well, I...

716
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:57,757
I was tinkering with the last
story just this morning.

717
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,177
Besides, if you
publish posthumously,

718
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:02,637
nobody can ask you
for rewrites.

719
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,431
I was hoping to finish
another two stories,

720
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,809
but there isn't enough time.

721
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:11,646
You keep on saying
there's no more time.

722
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,066
You see, Melanie,

723
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:17,527
after the last attempt
to rescue my father failed,

724
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:20,697
I spent months trying
to figure out what went wrong.

725
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,699
Eventually, I came
to understand the nature

726
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:23,909
of what was happening to him.

727
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:26,494
It was as if he
was frozen in time

728
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,580
at the moment
of the accident,

729
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,541
and the link between us
was like an elastic cord.

730
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:34,377
Every so often, the cord
would grow taut enough

731
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,755
to yank him forward
into<i> my</i> time,

732
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,298
but only for a few minutes.

733
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:40,675
I realized that

734
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,386
if my motion through time
came to a stop,

735
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,888
the cord would go slack,

736
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:47,432
and he'd be lost
in subspace forever,

737
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,350
but if I could cut the cord

738
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,228
when the link
was at its strongest--

739
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:52,395
while we were together--

740
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,897
he'd return to the moment

741
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,273
of the accident.

742
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:03,240
Your father's coming here,
isn't he?

743
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,574
Soon.

744
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:06,576
Yes.

745
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:12,249
You're going to cut the cord,
aren't you?

746
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:22,508
I want you
to promise me something.

747
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,846
Anything.

748
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,474
While you're studying
my stories,

749
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:32,351
poke your head up
every once in a while.

750
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:33,895
Take a look around.

751
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:37,190
See what's going on.

752
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:40,860
It's life, Melanie.

753
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:45,740
And you can miss it
if you don't open your eyes.

754
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,971
Thank you...

755
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:09,973
for everything.

756
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:23,778
It was a pleasure meeting you,

757
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,155
young lady.

758
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,945
Jake.

759
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,289
Mmm...

760
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,667
I've been expecting you.

761
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,674
I'm glad to see
you're still in this house.

762
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:11,970
You seemed happy here.

763
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:15,098
And this...

764
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:19,894
I-I can't tell
you how good

765
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:23,398
it makes me feel
you got back to writing.

766
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:26,151
(<i> gasping</i> )

767
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:28,194
Jake, what is it?

768
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,072
Read the dedication.

769
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,080
"To my father...

770
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,499
who's coming home."

771
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,007
Thank you, but I...

772
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,842
I don't understand.

773
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:53,428
It was me.

774
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:56,222
It was me all along.

775
00:41:56,222 --> 00:42:00,101
I've been dragging you
through time like an anchor,

776
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:03,104
and now it's time
to cut you loose.

777
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,275
Jake, what are you saying?

778
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,749
It won't be long now.

779
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,626
Jake, no!

780
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:32,800
When I die, you'll go back

781
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,593
to where this all began.

782
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:39,765
Just remember
to dodge the energy discharge

783
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,267
from the warp core.

784
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:46,898
Jake, you could still have
so many years left.

785
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,107
No.

786
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:51,986
We have to be together
when I die.

787
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:58,493
Jake, you didn't have
to do this...

788
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,953
not for me.

789
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:06,959
For you and for the boy
that I was.

790
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:09,295
He needs you...

791
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,214
more than you know.

792
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:14,092
Don't you see?

793
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:18,221
We're going to get a second...

794
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,933
chance.

795
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:28,273
Jake...

796
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:32,318
my sweet boy.

797
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,153
(<i> quiet sob</i> )

798
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:46,165
You okay?

799
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:48,960
H-How'd you know
that was coming?

800
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,881
I guess we were just
lucky this time.

801
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:00,972
You okay, Dad?

802
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,353
I am now, Jake.

803
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:14,110
I am now.
