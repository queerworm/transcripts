1
00:00:08,712 --> 00:00:12,414
Squid...
my favorite human food.

2
00:00:12,454 --> 00:00:15,690
Mmm. Delicious, sir.

3
00:00:15,729 --> 00:00:18,132
Mm-mmm.
Terrific as always, Dad.

4
00:00:18,168 --> 00:00:20,071
I'm glad you like it.

5
00:00:20,106 --> 00:00:24,013
Sir, if I may say so,
this sauce tastes very familiar.

6
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,178
Well, it should.

7
00:00:25,218 --> 00:00:27,314
It's purée of tube grubs.

8
00:00:27,357 --> 00:00:28,325
Oh!

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,886
Tube grubs?

10
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,903
I figured if Nog is
willing to eat squid

11
00:00:32,937 --> 00:00:35,774
it's only fair
that we try tube grubs.

12
00:00:35,811 --> 00:00:37,679
Besides, you said
it was terrific.

13
00:00:37,716 --> 00:00:39,413
That was before I knew
what it was.

14
00:00:39,453 --> 00:00:41,856
Eat. You need more meat
on your bones.

15
00:00:43,463 --> 00:00:44,453
So, tell me, Nog

16
00:00:44,498 --> 00:00:46,526
how do you like
working security?

17
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,473
It's very interesting, sir.

18
00:00:48,508 --> 00:00:50,536
That's not what you told me.

19
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,548
Jake.

20
00:00:51,582 --> 00:00:52,949
Something wrong?

21
00:00:52,985 --> 00:00:53,953
No, sir.

22
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:55,616
Everything's quite satisfactory.

23
00:00:55,658 --> 00:00:57,287
Thank you, sir.

24
00:00:57,362 --> 00:00:58,330
Could've fooled me.

25
00:00:59,835 --> 00:01:03,503
Cadet, if there's a problem,
I want to hear about it.

26
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:07,081
Well, sir...

27
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,645
it's the Klingons, sir.

28
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:09,919
What about them?

29
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:12,488
It's their... attitude, sir.

30
00:01:12,532 --> 00:01:13,500
It's bad.

31
00:01:13,535 --> 00:01:14,503
Bad?

32
00:01:14,537 --> 00:01:15,596
They're loud

33
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,907
obnoxious,
and if I may say so, sir

34
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:19,437
generally intoxicated.

35
00:01:19,482 --> 00:01:21,817
They walk around the station
like they own the place.

36
00:01:21,854 --> 00:01:23,825
And whenever
a station security officer

37
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:25,021
tries to talk to them

38
00:01:25,062 --> 00:01:27,226
say, to ask them to keep
the noise level down

39
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:28,964
on the Promenade,
they ignore him.

40
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:30,337
You mean, they ignore you.

41
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:38,316
They never look me in the eye
when I try to talk to them, sir.

42
00:01:38,361 --> 00:01:41,095
They just stare over my head
and pretend I'm not even there.

43
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:44,565
I hate when they do that.

44
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:48,915
I can see how that might
be annoying.

45
00:01:48,952 --> 00:01:50,444
Not as annoying
as listening to him

46
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:51,822
complain about it
all the time.

47
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:54,525
Here is what I suggest, cadet.

48
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:55,830
The next time the Klingons

49
00:01:55,869 --> 00:01:57,566
refuse to acknowledge
your presence

50
00:01:57,606 --> 00:01:59,873
do what a Klingon would do.

51
00:01:59,913 --> 00:02:01,246
Confront them about it.

52
00:02:01,283 --> 00:02:04,154
If you stand up to them,
you'll earn their respect.

53
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:07,560
Or get your butt kicked,
one or the other.

54
00:02:07,597 --> 00:02:10,434
Either way,
they'll never ignore you again.

55
00:02:11,473 --> 00:02:13,910
Enter.

56
00:02:13,946 --> 00:02:16,144
Captain, I need
to speak with you...

57
00:02:16,184 --> 00:02:18,246
alone.

58
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:20,283
That does it.

59
00:02:21,063 --> 00:02:22,498
Not now, Nog.

60
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:23,501
But, sir...

61
00:02:23,536 --> 00:02:24,869
Come on, Nog.

62
00:02:24,906 --> 00:02:26,398
Let's go...

63
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:31,015
Captain, my crew and I

64
00:02:31,053 --> 00:02:33,388
were patrolling
the Cardassian border.

65
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,954
We intercepted
a very disturbing message.

66
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:37,593
This is a Maquis code.

67
00:02:37,636 --> 00:02:39,766
I was as surprised as you.

68
00:02:39,807 --> 00:02:41,710
I thought the Maquis
were wiped out by Cardassia

69
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:44,878
and their new Dominion allies,
but it would appear...

70
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,914
I was mistaken.

71
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,359
Were you able to decode it?

72
00:02:48,395 --> 00:02:49,420
Mmm...

73
00:02:51,903 --> 00:02:54,569
Michael, I hope you
get this message.

74
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,877
We've launched the missiles.

75
00:02:56,915 --> 00:02:59,444
They should reach Cardassia
in 13 days.

76
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:01,526
It may not bring back our dead

77
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,294
but at least
they'll have a lot of company.

78
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,402
Did you detect any missiles?

79
00:03:07,441 --> 00:03:11,440
No, but that proves nothing.

80
00:03:13,522 --> 00:03:15,425
A few months ago

81
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:20,872
the Klingon High Council
decided to aid the Maquis

82
00:03:20,906 --> 00:03:22,706
in their fight
against Cardassia.

83
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:27,084
We provided them with 30
class-4 cloaking devices.

84
00:03:27,122 --> 00:03:30,027
It was our understanding they
would use them on their ships.

85
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:33,194
But they could've been mounted
on the missiles instead.

86
00:03:33,236 --> 00:03:35,001
You see the problem.

87
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:41,383
The Maquis had access
to tricobalt explosives

88
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:45,124
biogenic weapons,
antimatter warheads...

89
00:03:45,165 --> 00:03:47,659
The death toll could be
in the millions.

90
00:03:48,673 --> 00:03:50,507
I knew that the Maquis
were desperate

91
00:03:50,544 --> 00:03:51,672
but I didn't believe

92
00:03:51,713 --> 00:03:54,242
that they would resort
to something like this.

93
00:03:54,287 --> 00:03:56,315
A sabre bear is most deadly

94
00:03:56,357 --> 00:03:59,159
when it is trapped
with no hope of escape.

95
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:02,035
Cardassia's
under Dominion protection.

96
00:04:02,071 --> 00:04:06,104
If millions of their citizens
are killed by human terrorists

97
00:04:06,148 --> 00:04:07,674
they'll demand revenge.

98
00:04:07,718 --> 00:04:10,714
And their Dominion allies
will see that they get it.

99
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:13,698
They'll launch a counterstrike
against the Federation

100
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,498
the Klingon Empire

101
00:04:15,537 --> 00:04:18,704
and the entire Alpha Quadrant.

102
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:22,710
And start a war
that could destroy us all.

103
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:37,231
Report.

104
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,367
Do the words
"needle in a haystack"

105
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:40,571
mean anything to you?

106
00:06:40,613 --> 00:06:42,481
We spent over 50 hours
searching the Badlands

107
00:06:42,517 --> 00:06:44,886
for signs of the Maquis
missiles without success.

108
00:06:44,923 --> 00:06:46,017
We would've stayed longer

109
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:48,588
but we had a hard time
avoiding the Jem'Hadar patrols.

110
00:06:48,698 --> 00:06:49,723
Let me guess.

111
00:06:49,768 --> 00:06:51,705
They homed in
on your plasma wake.

112
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,004
Even though we were cloaked

113
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:54,602
they were still
able to track us.

114
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:57,016
The <i>Defiant's</i> warp engines
are too powerful.

115
00:06:57,052 --> 00:06:59,684
They ionize the nebular
gasses in the Badlands.

116
00:06:59,725 --> 00:07:03,029
It's like a Ligorian mastodon
moving through the forest.

117
00:07:03,066 --> 00:07:04,729
You may not be able to see it

118
00:07:04,771 --> 00:07:07,403
but it definitely makes
the leaves rustle.

119
00:07:07,444 --> 00:07:09,038
I need answers, people.

120
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:10,984
If those missiles do exist

121
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:12,956
they are only 11 days
from their target.

122
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,984
I need to know where they are
and how to stop them.

123
00:07:15,028 --> 00:07:16,327
We need more information...

124
00:07:16,365 --> 00:07:19,099
a way to narrow our search.

125
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,738
I think I know someone
who can help.

126
00:07:28,794 --> 00:07:31,562
Eddington, wake up.

127
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:36,846
I'm dreaming, right?

128
00:07:36,881 --> 00:07:38,510
This is a nightmare.

129
00:07:38,551 --> 00:07:41,045
This is a nightmare,
all right

130
00:07:41,091 --> 00:07:43,028
but you are wide awake.

131
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:46,400
I was wondering
when you'd show up.

132
00:07:46,437 --> 00:07:49,308
I expected to see you here
weeks ago.

133
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,369
I've been busy.

134
00:07:50,414 --> 00:07:51,815
But now you're here.

135
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,547
So enjoy yourself.

136
00:07:53,587 --> 00:07:55,250
Savor the moment.

137
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:58,321
I know you've been wanting
to gloat over my defeat

138
00:07:58,366 --> 00:07:59,356
for a long time.

139
00:07:59,401 --> 00:08:00,836
I'm not here to gloat.

140
00:08:00,871 --> 00:08:01,839
You deserve to.

141
00:08:01,874 --> 00:08:03,002
You won.

142
00:08:03,043 --> 00:08:06,643
I betrayed Starfleet
by joining the Maquis.

143
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:10,023
You swore you'd track me down
and you did.

144
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,757
You got your revenge.

145
00:08:11,798 --> 00:08:15,865
Actually, that's what I'm here
to talk about... revenge.

146
00:08:15,907 --> 00:08:17,969
One of my favorite topics.

147
00:08:24,461 --> 00:08:26,557
I believe that was
intended for you.

148
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,275
Michael,
I hope you get this message.

149
00:08:32,313 --> 00:08:34,716
We've launched the missiles.

150
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,050
They should reach Carda...

151
00:08:37,527 --> 00:08:39,190
Don't you want to hear
the rest of it?

152
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,724
Why should I?

153
00:08:41,837 --> 00:08:43,933
It has nothing to do with me.

154
00:08:43,975 --> 00:08:46,208
Michael is a very common name.

155
00:08:46,247 --> 00:08:50,349
True, but somehow
I think you're the right one.

156
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:52,521
Guess again.

157
00:08:59,645 --> 00:09:04,453
If those missiles hit Cardassia,
it could start a war.

158
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,657
Billions of people
will be killed.

159
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:10,729
If you expect me to shed a tear

160
00:09:10,772 --> 00:09:12,936
you're going to be disappointed.

161
00:09:12,978 --> 00:09:15,542
I used up all my tears

162
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:17,851
when the Dominion
slaughtered the Maquis.

163
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:19,917
I sat here in this cell
for three days

164
00:09:19,961 --> 00:09:22,057
and listened to the reports
as they came in.

165
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,660
In those three days

166
00:09:23,703 --> 00:09:28,909
everyone and everything
I cared about was wiped out.

167
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:30,783
I heard the same reports.

168
00:09:30,854 --> 00:09:32,153
It was a tragedy.

169
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,288
Your generosity of spirit
touches me.

170
00:09:35,331 --> 00:09:38,737
But you don't give a damn
about what happened to us

171
00:09:38,773 --> 00:09:42,738
and I don't give a damn
about what happens to you.

172
00:09:44,854 --> 00:09:47,052
You may have taken off
the uniform

173
00:09:47,093 --> 00:09:49,291
but you're still
a Starfleet officer.

174
00:09:49,331 --> 00:09:50,732
And you don't want a war

175
00:09:50,768 --> 00:09:52,533
between the Federation
and the Dominion

176
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:53,836
any more than I do.

177
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:56,380
What you want and what I want
doesn't really matter.

178
00:09:57,384 --> 00:09:58,683
There's nothing you can do

179
00:09:58,721 --> 00:10:01,250
to stop those missiles
from hitting their targets.

180
00:10:01,294 --> 00:10:05,760
They're cloaked,
highly maneuverable...

181
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:08,139
programmed to change course
at random.

182
00:10:08,176 --> 00:10:09,509
You'll never find them.

183
00:10:09,546 --> 00:10:11,881
Maybe we can't locate
the missiles

184
00:10:11,953 --> 00:10:14,755
but that doesn't mean
we can't stop them.

185
00:10:14,793 --> 00:10:17,527
You must have programmed
in an abort code...

186
00:10:17,565 --> 00:10:21,233
some way to deactivate
the missiles by remote.

187
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:23,610
Even if there was such a thing

188
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:26,552
you'd have to transmit it
from the launch site.

189
00:10:27,824 --> 00:10:30,022
And I don't think you're
going to find that either.

190
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:35,339
No code, no launch site.

191
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,507
I'm afraid you're
out of luck, Captain.

192
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,648
Looks like
everyone's out of luck.

193
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:53,107
That's it?

194
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:56,523
You're just going to lie there
and do nothing.

195
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:58,324
That's what you do
when you're in prison...

196
00:10:58,363 --> 00:11:00,425
nothing.

197
00:11:00,468 --> 00:11:01,903
Just sit back and wait

198
00:11:01,938 --> 00:11:04,171
for the next
counseling session...

199
00:11:04,211 --> 00:11:06,877
the next
psychological evaluation...

200
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,511
the next rehabilitation
seminar.

201
00:11:08,555 --> 00:11:10,822
What if I could get you
out of here?

202
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,127
Arrange a pardon
in exchange for your helping me?

203
00:11:13,165 --> 00:11:15,967
Oh, you like this,
don't you, Ben?

204
00:11:16,072 --> 00:11:18,441
You like deciding
the fate of others.

205
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:20,313
It makes you feel important.

206
00:11:20,349 --> 00:11:21,875
It's not about me.

207
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,549
Do you want your freedom or not?

208
00:11:23,591 --> 00:11:24,753
Freedom, huh?

209
00:11:24,793 --> 00:11:27,766
Tell me, if they did release me,
where would I go?

210
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:28,895
What would I do?

211
00:11:28,937 --> 00:11:30,167
Anything you want.

212
00:11:30,206 --> 00:11:33,008
What about bringing the Maquis
back from the dead?

213
00:11:33,047 --> 00:11:35,518
Can I do that?

214
00:11:35,552 --> 00:11:36,953
Can you?

215
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,426
Can anyone?

216
00:11:39,462 --> 00:11:40,988
No.

217
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:42,935
I didn't think so.

218
00:11:42,971 --> 00:11:45,876
In that case,
I'll tell you what I want.

219
00:11:45,911 --> 00:11:47,882
I want to lie here

220
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,048
until the Jem'Hadar
blow this place to pieces...

221
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,160
and me along with it.

222
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,158
Ah!

223
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,160
Careful.

224
00:12:07,195 --> 00:12:08,459
That hurts.

225
00:12:08,498 --> 00:12:10,024
I haven't done anything yet.

226
00:12:10,136 --> 00:12:11,537
Well, what are you
waiting for?

227
00:12:11,572 --> 00:12:12,540
I told you it hurts.

228
00:12:12,574 --> 00:12:13,542
You'll survive.

229
00:12:13,577 --> 00:12:14,671
Did you catch him?

230
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:15,943
We caught him.

231
00:12:15,983 --> 00:12:18,512
Or rather, I should say
Major Kira caught him.

232
00:12:18,556 --> 00:12:19,820
I didn't really do anything.

233
00:12:19,858 --> 00:12:22,022
I was in the Bajoran shrine
meditating

234
00:12:22,064 --> 00:12:24,832
and he burst in, stark-naked,
fell to his knees

235
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,341
crying out to the Prophets
for protection.

236
00:12:27,377 --> 00:12:28,676
Morn... of all people.

237
00:12:28,713 --> 00:12:31,515
Who would've thought
he'd just snap like that?

238
00:12:31,554 --> 00:12:32,784
Certainly not me.

239
00:12:32,823 --> 00:12:34,349
Which makes me wonder

240
00:12:34,394 --> 00:12:37,231
what could've pushed
him over the edge?

241
00:12:37,267 --> 00:12:39,967
Why are you looking at me?

242
00:12:40,007 --> 00:12:42,103
I'm the victim here.

243
00:12:42,146 --> 00:12:43,114
Huh.

244
00:12:43,148 --> 00:12:44,515
He hit me with a barstool.

245
00:12:44,551 --> 00:12:46,613
Why did he hit you?

246
00:12:46,656 --> 00:12:48,421
I don't have the faintest idea.

247
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,827
Think harder.

248
00:12:49,864 --> 00:12:51,835
Witnesses say you
were talking to him

249
00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:53,965
right up to the second
he went berserk.

250
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,704
Of course I was talking to him.

251
00:12:55,745 --> 00:12:58,148
That's what bartenders
are supposed to do...

252
00:12:58,251 --> 00:13:00,620
talk to their customers.

253
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:01,715
What exactly was it

254
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:03,730
that you were talking
to him about?

255
00:13:03,764 --> 00:13:05,758
All I said was

256
00:13:05,802 --> 00:13:07,898
that the military personnel
on this station

257
00:13:07,941 --> 00:13:11,677
are starting to look
a little nervous.

258
00:13:11,716 --> 00:13:14,621
And when they get nervous,
I get nervous.

259
00:13:14,657 --> 00:13:17,128
And that's all you said?

260
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,824
Basically.

261
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:22,330
I might have done
a little harmless theorizing.

262
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,901
About what?

263
00:13:24,948 --> 00:13:27,921
Oh, something like...

264
00:13:27,956 --> 00:13:30,393
it was only a matter of time
before the Dominion

265
00:13:30,428 --> 00:13:32,661
launched a full-scale assault
against the Federation

266
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,329
and when that happened

267
00:13:34,371 --> 00:13:37,903
the station would undoubtedly
be their first target.

268
00:13:42,457 --> 00:13:46,159
And I might have
idly suggested...

269
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:47,634
that there wasn't
a chance in hell

270
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:49,537
that any of us
would get out of here alive.

271
00:13:49,574 --> 00:13:51,168
And that's when Morn hit you

272
00:13:51,211 --> 00:13:53,148
with the barstool
and ran onto the Promenade

273
00:13:53,182 --> 00:13:55,449
screaming, "We're all doomed."

274
00:13:55,488 --> 00:13:58,188
Some people just don't
react well to stress.

275
00:13:58,228 --> 00:13:59,196
Ow!

276
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,198
Ops to Major Kira.

277
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:01,497
Go ahead.

278
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:04,100
There's an incoming transmission
from Captain Sisko.

279
00:14:04,142 --> 00:14:05,304
Be right there.

280
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,814
Probably wants to tell us

281
00:14:06,848 --> 00:14:09,434
that the first wave
of Jem'Hadar is on the way.

282
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:10,626
Ha ha ha.

283
00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:12,161
Very funny.

284
00:14:13,476 --> 00:14:14,775
She's joking, right?

285
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:15,781
Ah!

286
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:17,307
Hold still.

287
00:14:17,353 --> 00:14:18,947
My plan is to go
into the Badlands

288
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:21,550
find the launch site
and deactivate those missiles.

289
00:14:21,596 --> 00:14:23,567
You make it sound so easy.

290
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,537
You sure you don't want me
to send the <i>Defiant?</i>

291
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:27,975
The <i>Defiant</i> would just attract
unwanted attention.

292
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:29,946
Maybe, but I'd feel
a hell of a lot better

293
00:14:29,982 --> 00:14:31,417
if you weren't out there alone.

294
00:14:31,452 --> 00:14:32,921
Don't worry, Major.

295
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,186
I'm not alone.

296
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:49,863
Dinner.

297
00:14:49,897 --> 00:14:51,959
What about these?

298
00:14:52,002 --> 00:14:54,371
What about them?

299
00:14:54,407 --> 00:14:56,537
Makes it
a little difficult to eat.

300
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:57,912
You'll manage.

301
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,753
Mmm.

302
00:15:03,797 --> 00:15:07,739
Replicator entrée number 103...
curried chicken and rice

303
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:10,006
with a side order of carrots.

304
00:15:10,112 --> 00:15:13,108
Or at least that's what
they want us to believe.

305
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:16,559
But you and I both know
what we're really eating...

306
00:15:16,594 --> 00:15:18,929
replicated protein molecules
and textured carbohydrates.

307
00:15:20,637 --> 00:15:22,938
Mmm, it's not that bad.

308
00:15:24,847 --> 00:15:26,750
It may look like chicken,
but it still tastes

309
00:15:26,786 --> 00:15:28,517
like replicated protein
molecules to me.

310
00:15:28,556 --> 00:15:30,789
You don't want it,
don't eat it.

311
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,062
Remember
that Thanksgiving dinner

312
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:36,369
you cooked
for the senior staff last year?

313
00:15:36,408 --> 00:15:38,173
How many months did
it take you to grow

314
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:40,343
all those vegetables
in the hydroponic garden?

315
00:15:40,385 --> 00:15:43,358
Every ingredient fresh, real.

316
00:15:43,392 --> 00:15:46,696
Though you did put too much
tarragon in the stuffing.

317
00:15:46,734 --> 00:15:48,830
I wasn't aware
that you were a food critic.

318
00:15:48,872 --> 00:15:50,273
I wasn't

319
00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:53,111
until I joined the Maquis
and started eating real food.

320
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:55,951
Food that I'd grown
with my own hands.

321
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,583
Fresh corn

322
00:15:57,626 --> 00:16:00,120
sweet as a baby's smile,
and tomatoes...

323
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,503
Do you know how hard it is
to grow tomatoes?

324
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,034
There's always too much rain,
or not enough.

325
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,914
It's too hot.
It's too cold.

326
00:16:09,454 --> 00:16:12,724
I wonder what happened
to those tomato plants.

327
00:16:13,831 --> 00:16:16,098
Probably burned to the ground

328
00:16:16,204 --> 00:16:18,334
along with everything else.

329
00:16:18,376 --> 00:16:19,709
If we don't stop
those missiles

330
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:21,683
a lot of things are going
to burn to the ground

331
00:16:21,716 --> 00:16:23,653
and not just on Cardassia.

332
00:16:23,688 --> 00:16:26,593
You never give up,
do you, Ben?

333
00:16:26,628 --> 00:16:28,929
Here we are having a pleasant
conversation about food

334
00:16:28,968 --> 00:16:30,665
and all you're thinking about
is the mission

335
00:16:30,705 --> 00:16:32,869
and how to get me to cooperate.

336
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,778
You're wasting your breath.

337
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,344
As far as I'm concerned,
my life is over.

338
00:16:37,387 --> 00:16:38,822
I'm dead.

339
00:16:41,431 --> 00:16:44,461
For a dead man, you talk a lot.

340
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,771
Then why didn't you
leave me in prison?

341
00:16:48,013 --> 00:16:51,454
Because I have a job to do
and I can't do it without you.

342
00:16:51,488 --> 00:16:52,547
You're going to have to.

343
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:54,721
I told you when you
dragged me out of my cell

344
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,289
that I wasn't going
to help you.

345
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,463
I meant it then
and I mean it now.

346
00:16:58,505 --> 00:17:01,034
I am trying to prevent a war.

347
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:03,345
No, you're the one
who set the ground rules

348
00:17:03,384 --> 00:17:04,876
when you came after me, Ben.

349
00:17:04,921 --> 00:17:07,415
You're the one
who made it personal.

350
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:08,655
You could have looked
the other way.

351
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:10,427
You could have left
the Maquis alone

352
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:11,492
but you didn't do it.

353
00:17:11,536 --> 00:17:13,404
You hunted us, hounded us

354
00:17:13,441 --> 00:17:15,674
fought us
every chance you got

355
00:17:15,713 --> 00:17:18,277
and in the end, you set
us up for the slaughter.

356
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,487
I expected better of you
than that.

357
00:17:21,527 --> 00:17:24,364
So did a lot of people...

358
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,373
people like Cal Hudson.

359
00:17:27,407 --> 00:17:29,207
I bet you haven't heard
that name in a while.

360
00:17:29,245 --> 00:17:30,407
You're right about that.

361
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:33,149
He told me the two of you were
friends at the Academy.

362
00:17:33,188 --> 00:17:34,919
And a long time after.

363
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:36,223
Until he joined the Maquis.

364
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:39,131
He betrayed his oath
to Starfleet.

365
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:41,072
If it makes you
feel any better

366
00:17:41,107 --> 00:17:43,237
he paid for his sins.

367
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,583
He was killed in a skirmish
with the Cardassians.

368
00:17:50,129 --> 00:17:53,501
He was a good man.

369
00:17:53,537 --> 00:17:55,268
He felt the same about you.

370
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:57,812
He thought you were wrong
about the Maquis

371
00:17:57,847 --> 00:17:59,214
but he forgave you

372
00:17:59,251 --> 00:18:03,090
which is ironic considering
you never forgave him.

373
00:18:03,126 --> 00:18:04,493
You can't forgive any of us.

374
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,367
And not because
we betrayed Starfleet

375
00:18:07,403 --> 00:18:08,770
or the Federation

376
00:18:08,807 --> 00:18:11,507
but because we betrayed you.

377
00:18:11,547 --> 00:18:15,044
That's what this is all about...
your ego.

378
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:17,960
Where Benjamin Sisko leads,
all must follow.

379
00:18:17,995 --> 00:18:19,020
Is that what you really believe?

380
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:20,261
It's the truth, isn't it?

381
00:18:20,301 --> 00:18:23,035
The Maquis were never much
of a threat to the Federation

382
00:18:23,074 --> 00:18:24,270
but we were a threat to you.

383
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,148
We were a stain on your record
and you couldn't have that

384
00:18:27,184 --> 00:18:28,278
not when you were so busy

385
00:18:28,354 --> 00:18:30,825
measuring yourself
for an Admiral's uniform.

386
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,159
You want to blame me

387
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:34,599
for what happened
to the Maquis? Fine.

388
00:18:34,635 --> 00:18:35,603
Go ahead.

389
00:18:35,638 --> 00:18:36,606
Blame me.

390
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,608
Blame Starfleet.

391
00:18:37,643 --> 00:18:38,771
Blame the Federation.

392
00:18:38,812 --> 00:18:40,942
Blame everyone except
Michael Eddington.

393
00:18:40,984 --> 00:18:42,749
The Maquis won
its greatest victories

394
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,756
under my leadership.

395
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,884
Your leadership...

396
00:18:44,927 --> 00:18:46,864
your shining moment of glory.

397
00:18:46,898 --> 00:18:49,335
Michael Eddington gets to
take off his gold uniform

398
00:18:49,404 --> 00:18:50,737
and play hero.

399
00:18:50,774 --> 00:18:51,970
That's what you always wanted...

400
00:18:52,011 --> 00:18:54,482
to lead troops
in a glorious cause.

401
00:18:54,516 --> 00:18:56,110
Well, you had your chance

402
00:18:56,153 --> 00:18:57,588
and look where you led them.

403
00:18:57,623 --> 00:18:59,526
Right into their graves.

404
00:18:59,562 --> 00:19:02,296
They died because I wasn't there
when they needed me most!

405
00:19:02,402 --> 00:19:03,666
Because you put me in jail.

406
00:19:03,705 --> 00:19:05,299
They died
because you filled their heads

407
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,308
with false hopes

408
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,474
sold them dreams
of a military victory

409
00:19:08,517 --> 00:19:10,818
when what they needed
was a negotiated peace.

410
00:19:10,855 --> 00:19:12,552
We had the Cardassians
on the run.

411
00:19:12,593 --> 00:19:15,191
And they ran right into the arms
of the Dominion.

412
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:17,101
End of story.

413
00:19:17,137 --> 00:19:19,540
Not quite the end.

414
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:20,544
That's right.

415
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:22,344
A few survivors
of your noble crusade

416
00:19:22,383 --> 00:19:23,875
have decided to launch

417
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,950
a pointless retaliatory
strike against Cardassia.

418
00:19:26,995 --> 00:19:28,658
It's not so pointless.

419
00:19:28,698 --> 00:19:29,860
If you can't have victory

420
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:32,099
sometimes you just have
to settle for revenge.

421
00:19:34,145 --> 00:19:35,580
Is that what you want?

422
00:19:35,615 --> 00:19:37,813
To be remembered as the man

423
00:19:37,854 --> 00:19:39,585
who helped bring about
the worst war

424
00:19:39,624 --> 00:19:41,253
in Federation history?

425
00:19:41,296 --> 00:19:44,394
Not quite the legacy I had
in mind, but I can live with it.

426
00:19:44,469 --> 00:19:45,904
Can you?

427
00:20:17,515 --> 00:20:18,574
No, no, no.

428
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:20,212
You can do better than that.

429
00:20:20,255 --> 00:20:21,952
You're barely making contact.

430
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:24,830
Again!

431
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:29,840
More wine!

432
00:20:29,878 --> 00:20:31,472
I don't care what anyone says.

433
00:20:31,516 --> 00:20:32,506
That's got to hurt.

434
00:20:32,618 --> 00:20:36,525
They're at 65 decibels...
loud, but not loud enough.

435
00:20:36,561 --> 00:20:38,053
What are you talking about?

436
00:20:38,098 --> 00:20:39,088
Five more decibels

437
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:40,727
and they'll be legally
disturbing the peace.

438
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:42,240
And then what?

439
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,542
And then I'm going to escort
them to a holding cell.

440
00:20:44,613 --> 00:20:46,481
You're going
to arrest General Martok

441
00:20:46,518 --> 00:20:47,817
for disturbing the peace?

442
00:20:47,855 --> 00:20:49,655
I am.

443
00:20:49,692 --> 00:20:52,722
Aren't you going to at least
call for backup?

444
00:20:52,766 --> 00:20:54,828
Jake, you heard
what your father said.

445
00:20:54,871 --> 00:20:59,109
They won't respect me until I
stand up to them... alone.

446
00:21:00,418 --> 00:21:02,947
Well, personally,
I think respect is overrated.

447
00:21:03,993 --> 00:21:05,519
That's it... 70 decibels.

448
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:06,655
They're mine.

449
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,549
Whoa!

450
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:13,187
You okay?

451
00:21:13,296 --> 00:21:14,355
I'm fine.

452
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,700
Just tell me
when everyone leaves.

453
00:21:16,738 --> 00:21:17,763
Why?

454
00:21:17,806 --> 00:21:20,073
Because I'm not getting up
until they do.

455
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:31,606
Eddington.

456
00:21:34,614 --> 00:21:36,049
Are we there yet?

457
00:21:36,084 --> 00:21:37,246
Where?

458
00:21:37,287 --> 00:21:40,158
That's the question,
isn't it?

459
00:21:40,194 --> 00:21:42,962
There's something here
I want you to see.

460
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,766
I'll pass, thanks.

461
00:21:45,974 --> 00:21:47,842
Suit yourself.

462
00:21:47,878 --> 00:21:49,712
Maybe it's nothing.

463
00:21:51,053 --> 00:21:54,619
It is hard to get an accurate
sensor reading in the Badlands

464
00:21:54,662 --> 00:21:56,690
but unless I'm mistaken

465
00:21:56,734 --> 00:21:59,400
two Jem'Hadar warships
are headed our way.

466
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:04,813
Yeah. Those are Jem'Hadar
warships all right.

467
00:22:04,853 --> 00:22:07,553
You've got a problem.

468
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:09,256
We both do.

469
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,528
Oh, they're coming closer.

470
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:13,334
One AU away.

471
00:22:15,712 --> 00:22:17,615
Point nine AU.

472
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,248
You said you wanted to be blown
to pieces by the Jem'Hadar?

473
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:23,195
Well, it looks like you're
going to get your wish.

474
00:22:24,366 --> 00:22:26,097
I have faith in you, Captain.

475
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:28,005
You'll get us out of this.

476
00:22:30,381 --> 00:22:32,614
Not me, Mr. Eddington.

477
00:22:33,689 --> 00:22:36,321
I don't know the Badlands
that well

478
00:22:36,395 --> 00:22:38,696
but you do.

479
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:41,239
Where are you going?

480
00:22:41,273 --> 00:22:42,332
To get a <i>raktajino.</i>

481
00:22:42,376 --> 00:22:43,743
Now?

482
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,344
Throat's a little dry.

483
00:22:46,385 --> 00:22:47,979
One <i>raktajino.</i>

484
00:22:48,023 --> 00:22:49,823
You're crazy.

485
00:22:49,861 --> 00:22:51,330
They're almost on top of us.

486
00:22:53,402 --> 00:22:55,669
One thing I will say
about these replicators.

487
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,872
They sure know how
to make Klingon coffee.

488
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,746
They're scanning us.

489
00:23:00,786 --> 00:23:04,227
They should be in firing range
any minute now.

490
00:23:04,262 --> 00:23:06,324
Very clever, Captain,
but it's not going to work.

491
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,735
I am not going to take the helm.

492
00:23:08,773 --> 00:23:10,333
Suit yourself.

493
00:23:12,214 --> 00:23:14,549
That is what you're
trying to do.

494
00:23:14,587 --> 00:23:15,555
Isn't it?

495
00:23:15,589 --> 00:23:16,579
I'm trying to see

496
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:19,325
how serious
your death wish really is.

497
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:22,166
I'm betting
that it doesn't even exist

498
00:23:22,204 --> 00:23:24,938
just like I'm betting that you
won't be able to sit back

499
00:23:24,978 --> 00:23:26,538
and let your friends
start a war

500
00:23:26,581 --> 00:23:28,677
that could destroy
the Alpha Quadrant.

501
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,280
That's an awfully big bet.

502
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,589
I don't think so.

503
00:23:33,766 --> 00:23:35,703
Point seven AU.

504
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:46,292
Can you lose them?

505
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:49,427
I plotted a spiral course
around a plasma filament.

506
00:23:49,537 --> 00:23:51,667
It should dissipate
our warp signature.

507
00:23:51,709 --> 00:23:53,076
Very fancy.

508
00:23:53,113 --> 00:23:55,084
You can take over now.

509
00:23:55,117 --> 00:23:56,882
Hmm.

510
00:23:56,921 --> 00:23:58,185
No.

511
00:23:58,225 --> 00:24:01,255
I don't think so.

512
00:24:01,298 --> 00:24:03,394
Let's get one thing
straight, Captain.

513
00:24:03,437 --> 00:24:05,100
I'll get you to the launch site

514
00:24:05,141 --> 00:24:07,408
and I'll help you deactivate
those missiles.

515
00:24:07,514 --> 00:24:09,417
But then you and I
are going to have it out...

516
00:24:09,518 --> 00:24:10,680
once and for all.

517
00:24:10,721 --> 00:24:12,156
You want a fight, mister...

518
00:24:12,191 --> 00:24:13,353
I will give you one.

519
00:24:13,394 --> 00:24:15,958
I don't intend
to fight you, Captain.

520
00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:18,438
I intend to kill you.

521
00:24:26,592 --> 00:24:28,620
Captain,
when I joined the Maquis

522
00:24:28,664 --> 00:24:31,728
I left some personal items
behind on the station.

523
00:24:31,772 --> 00:24:32,797
As far as I know

524
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:35,074
all your things
were put in storage.

525
00:24:35,113 --> 00:24:37,813
You didn't happen
to see an old Earth coin

526
00:24:37,853 --> 00:24:39,618
about this big...

527
00:24:39,657 --> 00:24:41,286
with a bird on the front?

528
00:24:41,328 --> 00:24:42,627
A bird?

529
00:24:42,664 --> 00:24:44,133
A loon, actually.

530
00:24:44,168 --> 00:24:45,728
My lucky looney.

531
00:24:45,771 --> 00:24:48,174
It's an old Canadian coin.

532
00:24:48,211 --> 00:24:50,375
Been in the family
for over 200 years.

533
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:53,218
It's probably in some locker
in the Assay Office

534
00:24:53,257 --> 00:24:55,728
along with the rest
of your things.

535
00:24:55,762 --> 00:24:57,061
I hope so.

536
00:24:57,099 --> 00:24:59,093
I'd hate to think I'd lost it.

537
00:25:01,176 --> 00:25:03,079
Speaking of things
you thought you'd lost...

538
00:25:09,161 --> 00:25:10,357
There's no way
those Jem'Hadar ships

539
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:11,366
could have tracked us.

540
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,630
Obviously there is.

541
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,162
Can we lose them again?

542
00:25:14,207 --> 00:25:16,736
Dissipating our warp
signature didn't work.

543
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,378
Don't tell me the Maquis
didn't have Plan "B."

544
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:20,718
You're not going to like it.

545
00:25:20,755 --> 00:25:22,817
Half an AU and closing.

546
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,454
If you do have a plan

547
00:25:24,497 --> 00:25:26,297
I guarantee
I'll learn to love it.

548
00:25:26,336 --> 00:25:29,332
We're going to have to realign
the impulse flow regulators.

549
00:25:29,376 --> 00:25:30,868
You mean shut down the engines?

550
00:25:30,913 --> 00:25:32,439
They'll be on us in a second.

551
00:25:32,483 --> 00:25:34,886
Who said anything
about shutting down the engines?

552
00:25:34,923 --> 00:25:36,654
You're thinking about
realigning the emitter

553
00:25:36,693 --> 00:25:37,889
while the engines are engaged...

554
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,524
one wrong move
and the flow regulators

555
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:40,729
will blow up in your face.

556
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,467
You mean, in your face.

557
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:44,569
I'll be piloting the ship.

558
00:25:44,612 --> 00:25:47,210
When you finish, we can
use the impulse exhaust

559
00:25:47,252 --> 00:25:49,052
to detonate the plasma field
behind us.

560
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,459
Even if the Jem'Hadar
survive the blast

561
00:25:51,496 --> 00:25:53,990
the shock wave should wipe out
any trace of our ion wake.

562
00:25:55,506 --> 00:25:57,443
Point four AU and closing.

563
00:25:57,476 --> 00:25:59,379
You'd better get started.

564
00:25:59,415 --> 00:26:02,388
All right,
but hold the ship steady.

565
00:26:02,422 --> 00:26:04,416
I don't want any accidents.

566
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,054
I'll do my best.

567
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:07,760
Hmm.

568
00:26:21,033 --> 00:26:24,975
Warning: Attempting to access
impulse flow regulators

569
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:27,914
while engines are engaged
is not recommended.

570
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,080
Tell me something I don't know.

571
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:32,093
Disengage safeties.

572
00:26:32,127 --> 00:26:35,032
Authorization:
Sisko-A-four-seven-one.

573
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:36,434
Acknowledged.

574
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,566
Safeties disengaged.

575
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:50,061
Damn it, Eddington.

576
00:26:50,103 --> 00:26:52,267
I told you
to hold the ship steady.

577
00:26:52,308 --> 00:26:53,504
Sorry, Captain.

578
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:55,607
We ran into a pocket
of boron gas.

579
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,381
Well, don't do it again.

580
00:27:04,972 --> 00:27:07,102
You still there, Captain?

581
00:27:07,144 --> 00:27:08,443
Disappointed?

582
00:27:08,481 --> 00:27:09,677
Just checking.

583
00:27:10,686 --> 00:27:12,178
Captain, I hate to rush you

584
00:27:12,223 --> 00:27:13,886
but things are going
to get very unpleasant

585
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:15,225
if we don't get
out of here soon.

586
00:27:15,263 --> 00:27:17,564
I'm aware of the problem.

587
00:27:19,507 --> 00:27:20,566
Eddington!

588
00:27:21,612 --> 00:27:23,515
That wasn't me.
They're firing at us.

589
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,678
Well, in that case...

590
00:27:24,752 --> 00:27:27,589
let her rip!

591
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,830
Well, that got
the adrenaline pumping.

592
00:27:46,872 --> 00:27:49,504
No sign of the Jem'Hadar.

593
00:27:49,545 --> 00:27:52,143
Looks like we lost them,
Captain.

594
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:56,793
Captain?

595
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,733
Computer, locate Captain Sisko.

596
00:28:00,772 --> 00:28:03,209
Internal sensors are off-line.

597
00:28:03,244 --> 00:28:04,804
Of course they are.

598
00:28:06,536 --> 00:28:08,769
I told you
to keep the ship steady!

599
00:28:08,808 --> 00:28:09,798
You're alive.

600
00:28:09,844 --> 00:28:11,438
What a pleasant surprise.

601
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:12,450
I'm sure.

602
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:14,546
Now, get us to the launch site!

603
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,351
I understand,
but all I'm saying, Nog

604
00:28:29,391 --> 00:28:31,088
is the next time you know
I have a girl over

605
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:32,563
just call me
before you come home.

606
00:28:32,598 --> 00:28:34,124
The two of you
were only talking.

607
00:28:34,168 --> 00:28:35,262
Well, you never know.

608
00:28:35,305 --> 00:28:37,002
Jake, I know your track record.

609
00:28:37,042 --> 00:28:38,602
You never get past talking.

610
00:28:38,713 --> 00:28:40,182
Now, that's a scurrilous lie.

611
00:28:40,217 --> 00:28:41,185
"Scurrilous"?

612
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,518
Is that worse
than a regular lie?

613
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:44,321
Look, I don't know
what the big deal is.

614
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,852
Just check before
you come home, okay?

615
00:28:45,897 --> 00:28:47,389
Okay. And you do the same.

616
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,905
Nog, you haven't had a date
since you left the Academy...

617
00:28:49,941 --> 00:28:51,274
unless you're
counting holosuites.

618
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:54,374
Now who's being scurrilous?

619
00:28:56,155 --> 00:28:57,590
I don't believe this.

620
00:28:57,625 --> 00:28:58,615
What's wrong?

621
00:28:58,661 --> 00:28:59,994
They're loitering
on the Promenade

622
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:01,364
in our old spot.

623
00:29:01,401 --> 00:29:03,463
I guess they know a good view
when they see one.

624
00:29:03,505 --> 00:29:04,735
Jake, don't you get it?

625
00:29:04,775 --> 00:29:07,110
They know I'm territorial
about that spot.

626
00:29:07,148 --> 00:29:09,746
They're purposely doing
this to insult me.

627
00:29:09,787 --> 00:29:11,552
Nog, you are definitely
getting stranger

628
00:29:11,592 --> 00:29:12,754
as you get older.

629
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,924
I can't let them do this to me.

630
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:16,334
Stay back, Jake.

631
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,101
This could get ugly.

632
00:29:22,551 --> 00:29:25,285
All right, it's time
for you to move along.

633
00:29:25,325 --> 00:29:26,988
We will decide

634
00:29:27,029 --> 00:29:29,193
when it is time to move.

635
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:33,836
Station regulation
82/7-B clearly states

636
00:29:33,879 --> 00:29:35,782
that loitering on the Promenade
is prohibited.

637
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:36,842
Is that so?!

638
00:29:36,886 --> 00:29:39,050
It is! Now, either move

639
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:41,655
or I'm going to have
to place you under arrest.

640
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:44,694
You are either very brave...

641
00:29:44,738 --> 00:29:48,042
or very stupid, Ferengi.

642
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,449
Probably a little of both.

643
00:29:54,929 --> 00:29:56,421
Indeed...

644
00:29:57,569 --> 00:30:00,474
Courage comes in all sizes.

645
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:03,243
But don't tempt fate.

646
00:30:03,282 --> 00:30:06,084
<i>Khi-GOSH.</i>

647
00:30:07,593 --> 00:30:10,191
Nog, I'm impressed.

648
00:30:11,301 --> 00:30:13,431
Klingons...

649
00:30:13,473 --> 00:30:15,740
you just have to know
how to handle them.

650
00:30:31,851 --> 00:30:33,685
Next stop: Athos IV...

651
00:30:33,722 --> 00:30:36,388
a grim little fogbound
piece of rock

652
00:30:36,428 --> 00:30:37,795
in the middle of nowhere.

653
00:30:37,832 --> 00:30:40,634
What better place to hide
a missile launching site?

654
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,232
We thought so.

655
00:30:44,415 --> 00:30:47,081
The sensors aren't
detecting anything.

656
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,649
That's the general idea.

657
00:30:49,694 --> 00:30:52,861
There's too much interference
to detect anything...

658
00:30:52,969 --> 00:30:55,236
but it's there.

659
00:30:55,274 --> 00:30:57,370
We'll never get a transporter
through all that static.

660
00:30:57,412 --> 00:30:58,813
We don't need to.

661
00:30:58,849 --> 00:31:01,822
There's a shuttle pad
not far from the launch site.

662
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,484
Then take us down.

663
00:31:15,389 --> 00:31:16,949
How far?

664
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,291
A few kilometers.

665
00:31:18,329 --> 00:31:20,163
This tunnel will take us
most of the way.

666
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,294
These tunnels are man-made.

667
00:31:21,336 --> 00:31:22,430
I know.

668
00:31:22,472 --> 00:31:23,964
I helped dig them myself.

669
00:31:40,282 --> 00:31:41,581
Now where?

670
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,420
Give me a minute
to get my bearings.

671
00:31:44,459 --> 00:31:45,427
It's been a while.

672
00:31:47,966 --> 00:31:49,960
You hear something?

673
00:31:59,862 --> 00:32:01,765
This area is secure.

674
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:18,204
These barrels are made
of duridium.

675
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:19,503
That should hold them off
for a while.

676
00:32:19,543 --> 00:32:21,639
I thought you said the Jem'Hadar
would never find this place.

677
00:32:21,681 --> 00:32:23,412
I didn't think they would.

678
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,653
I was wrong.

679
00:32:26,325 --> 00:32:27,453
I say we rush them.

680
00:32:27,495 --> 00:32:28,930
In this fog,
they'll have as much chance

681
00:32:28,965 --> 00:32:30,264
of hitting each other
as hitting us.

682
00:32:30,302 --> 00:32:31,065
Too risky.

683
00:32:31,104 --> 00:32:32,198
You never would have made it

684
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:33,833
in the Maquis
with that kind of attitude.

685
00:32:33,877 --> 00:32:35,506
It's not me that I'm worried
about, it's you.

686
00:32:35,547 --> 00:32:37,711
If you get killed, there'll be
no way to stop those missiles.

687
00:32:37,752 --> 00:32:38,846
Take this.

688
00:32:38,889 --> 00:32:40,358
I'll go around,
try to draw their fire.

689
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:41,986
You should be able
to catch them off guard

690
00:32:42,063 --> 00:32:42,996
when they come after me.

691
00:32:43,098 --> 00:32:44,932
I can barely see
two meters in front of me.

692
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,496
How will I know
what I'm aiming at?

693
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,634
I'll be the one holding
the pipe.

694
00:32:47,676 --> 00:32:49,339
Attacking two Jem'Hadar
soldiers with a pipe...

695
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,348
that's a brilliant plan.

696
00:32:50,383 --> 00:32:51,351
It could be worse.

697
00:32:51,385 --> 00:32:52,820
I know... it could be
me holding the pipe.

698
00:32:52,855 --> 00:32:53,949
Exactly.

699
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:41,902
You have sharp eyes.

700
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,908
Not really.

701
00:33:42,942 --> 00:33:43,910
I just waited to see

702
00:33:43,945 --> 00:33:45,073
which of you was
knocked down first

703
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,843
and then I shot the one
still standing.

704
00:33:46,885 --> 00:33:48,753
Thank you for your vote
of confidence.

705
00:33:48,789 --> 00:33:51,056
Now help me drag these
bodies over to the well.

706
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:53,396
Maybe that way, the other
Jem'Hadar will look

707
00:33:53,434 --> 00:33:54,994
for their friends,
and not us.

708
00:34:04,427 --> 00:34:06,830
In a couple of minutes,
this entire settlement

709
00:34:06,866 --> 00:34:08,529
is going to be crawling
with Jem'Hadar.

710
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,541
I suggest you get us
to the launch site now.

711
00:34:10,575 --> 00:34:11,908
That way.

712
00:34:11,945 --> 00:34:13,004
Are you sure?

713
00:34:13,047 --> 00:34:14,380
Reasonably.

714
00:34:34,499 --> 00:34:35,695
We're close.

715
00:34:35,735 --> 00:34:37,034
Then let's keep moving.

716
00:34:41,014 --> 00:34:42,039
Wait.

717
00:34:52,609 --> 00:34:54,169
Vance.

718
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,374
You knew him?

719
00:34:56,852 --> 00:34:58,412
He was a shuttle pilot.

720
00:34:58,457 --> 00:35:00,928
And a friend.

721
00:35:00,962 --> 00:35:01,952
There are more.

722
00:35:27,905 --> 00:35:30,776
This wasn't supposed to happen.

723
00:35:30,812 --> 00:35:33,410
We were winning.

724
00:35:33,452 --> 00:35:37,588
The Cardassian Empire
was falling into chaos.

725
00:35:37,627 --> 00:35:39,655
The Maquis colonies were going

726
00:35:39,699 --> 00:35:42,729
to declare themselves
an independent nation.

727
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:45,303
Eddington, listen to me.

728
00:35:46,716 --> 00:35:48,413
This is not the time...

729
00:35:48,454 --> 00:35:50,117
It's over.

730
00:35:50,158 --> 00:35:51,286
It's not over.

731
00:35:51,328 --> 00:35:53,162
We still have to stop
those missiles.

732
00:35:53,198 --> 00:35:54,895
That's all you care about?

733
00:35:54,936 --> 00:35:56,804
The missiles?

734
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,708
It's too late for us
to help these people

735
00:35:58,745 --> 00:36:00,476
but if we don't stop
the missiles

736
00:36:00,516 --> 00:36:02,247
this will just be the beginning.

737
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:04,087
I was their leader.

738
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:07,566
I was responsible for them
and I failed.

739
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,333
I failed them all.

740
00:36:10,373 --> 00:36:12,367
Maybe we all failed them.

741
00:36:12,411 --> 00:36:14,678
Maybe we could have prevented
this from happening.

742
00:36:14,716 --> 00:36:15,912
I don't know.

743
00:36:15,986 --> 00:36:19,324
It's going to take a long time
and a lot of soul-searching

744
00:36:19,361 --> 00:36:21,594
before I find the answer

745
00:36:21,633 --> 00:36:25,039
but right now, we have
a mission to complete.

746
00:36:28,517 --> 00:36:29,884
I wish I knew for certain

747
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,187
that killing you
would make me feel better

748
00:36:32,226 --> 00:36:35,598
but I suppose that can wait
for another time.

749
00:36:44,688 --> 00:36:45,656
That's it.

750
00:36:45,691 --> 00:36:46,659
Are you sure?

751
00:36:46,693 --> 00:36:48,162
You want to stand here
and argue about it?

752
00:36:48,197 --> 00:36:49,427
Come on, it looks clear.

753
00:36:49,467 --> 00:36:50,457
Wait.

754
00:36:55,749 --> 00:36:58,779
I'm glad one of us remembered
they could do that.

755
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,660
No, wait.

756
00:37:05,706 --> 00:37:07,300
I don't want to damage
any of the equipment.

757
00:37:07,343 --> 00:37:08,333
Let me try something.

758
00:37:21,711 --> 00:37:23,614
Michael...

759
00:37:23,649 --> 00:37:25,050
I wondered when you'd get here.

760
00:37:28,561 --> 00:37:30,224
I came as soon as I could.

761
00:37:32,236 --> 00:37:34,469
Captain Sisko...

762
00:37:34,508 --> 00:37:37,504
I'd like you to meet
Rebecca Sullivan

763
00:37:37,548 --> 00:37:39,211
my wife.

764
00:37:47,105 --> 00:37:48,506
All right, we're
getting out of here.

765
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:50,239
We've got a runabout
hidden at the landing site.

766
00:37:50,279 --> 00:37:52,750
We can still access the tunnels
through the old well.

767
00:37:52,785 --> 00:37:53,753
Stick together.

768
00:37:53,788 --> 00:37:56,625
Try not to lose each other
in the fog, hmm?

769
00:37:57,797 --> 00:37:58,925
Wait a minute.

770
00:37:58,966 --> 00:38:00,492
What about disarming
the missiles?

771
00:38:00,537 --> 00:38:02,234
Look around you, Ben.

772
00:38:02,275 --> 00:38:04,040
Does this look
like a launch site?

773
00:38:04,145 --> 00:38:05,945
Eddington, I want
the truth now.

774
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:07,783
There never were any missiles

775
00:38:07,821 --> 00:38:10,224
no retaliatory strike
against Cardassia.

776
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,786
It was all a ploy,
a way to let

777
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,302
Michael know
that we'd made it here.

778
00:38:14,337 --> 00:38:16,433
This was
our fallback position

779
00:38:16,476 --> 00:38:19,040
but I needed your help
to evacuate these people.

780
00:38:19,081 --> 00:38:20,243
What would you have done

781
00:38:20,284 --> 00:38:22,084
if I hadn't forced
you to come with me?

782
00:38:22,189 --> 00:38:23,886
I would have volunteered.

783
00:38:25,798 --> 00:38:27,792
You should be smiling, Ben.

784
00:38:27,835 --> 00:38:31,298
That Dominion counterstrike
you were so worried about...

785
00:38:32,313 --> 00:38:34,010
it's not going to happen.

786
00:38:35,822 --> 00:38:37,816
Yes, you're right.

787
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:39,488
That is good news

788
00:38:39,531 --> 00:38:43,267
but I still
don't like being lied to.

789
00:38:46,848 --> 00:38:49,149
Well, I hope you're ready
to finish what you started.

790
00:38:49,253 --> 00:38:51,315
Michael, we don't
have time for this.

791
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:53,352
We'll finish this later.

792
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:54,866
All right.

793
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,631
You heard what Michael said.

794
00:38:56,672 --> 00:38:57,662
Stick together.

795
00:39:05,827 --> 00:39:07,262
You should have told me
the truth.

796
00:39:07,297 --> 00:39:09,461
If I had known the Jem'Hadar
were going to be here

797
00:39:09,502 --> 00:39:10,801
I would have brought more men.

798
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:12,707
The Jem'Hadar weren't
supposed to be here.

799
00:39:12,743 --> 00:39:14,737
No one knew
about this base but us.

800
00:39:20,863 --> 00:39:23,096
They landed three days ago.

801
00:39:23,135 --> 00:39:24,103
We tried to fight...

802
00:39:24,137 --> 00:39:25,105
I know.

803
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,507
I saw the bodies.

804
00:39:26,543 --> 00:39:27,671
I thought for a while there...

805
00:39:27,712 --> 00:39:29,272
I didn't think
I'd make it either

806
00:39:29,316 --> 00:39:31,514
but they kept
all the leaders alive.

807
00:39:31,555 --> 00:39:32,956
They were going
to make a present of us

808
00:39:32,992 --> 00:39:34,963
to the Cardassian
government.

809
00:39:34,996 --> 00:39:37,969
Now I guess we'll end up
in a Federation prison.

810
00:39:38,004 --> 00:39:39,371
No, we're not going
to prison...

811
00:39:39,408 --> 00:39:41,208
not if I have anything
to say about it.

812
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,872
Right now, I suggest
you concentrate

813
00:39:42,915 --> 00:39:44,145
on getting off this planet.

814
00:39:44,185 --> 00:39:45,654
We can worry
about the rest later.

815
00:39:45,689 --> 00:39:47,215
There's nothing
to worry about.

816
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:50,357
You're not going to put us
in prison, not this time.

817
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,964
Damn it, you never give up,
do you, Mr. Eddington?

818
00:39:53,007 --> 00:39:54,442
Never.

819
00:39:59,388 --> 00:40:01,119
Move!

820
00:40:04,534 --> 00:40:05,935
Go!

821
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:08,101
Whatever happens, don't stop
until you get to the runabout.

822
00:40:09,513 --> 00:40:10,607
You, too.

823
00:40:10,648 --> 00:40:12,311
I'm staying with you.

824
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,289
I'll be right behind you.

825
00:40:15,327 --> 00:40:16,489
Now get going.

826
00:40:21,709 --> 00:40:22,871
I didn't know you were married.

827
00:40:22,911 --> 00:40:25,144
We held the ceremony two weeks
before you captured me.

828
00:40:25,184 --> 00:40:27,087
Not much of a honeymoon.

829
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,955
I suggest we fall back, now.

830
00:40:30,998 --> 00:40:33,971
For once, you'll get
no argument from me.

831
00:40:37,713 --> 00:40:39,376
Go!

832
00:40:43,394 --> 00:40:44,795
You'd better get
to the runabout.

833
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:45,799
What about you?

834
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:46,801
I'd only slow you down.

835
00:40:46,836 --> 00:40:48,601
Just get Rebecca
and the others to safety.

836
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:50,040
I'm not going to let you just...

837
00:40:50,076 --> 00:40:51,066
Go!

838
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,955
Mr. Eddington, you are
one stubborn, headstrong...

839
00:40:55,991 --> 00:40:56,981
I told you only one of us

840
00:40:57,026 --> 00:40:58,655
would be coming back
from this mission.

841
00:41:06,382 --> 00:41:07,510
Where's Michael?

842
00:41:07,552 --> 00:41:08,714
He's not coming.

843
00:41:08,754 --> 00:41:11,123
What do you mean,
he's not coming?

844
00:41:11,161 --> 00:41:12,562
Rebecca...

845
00:41:14,067 --> 00:41:16,334
we have to go... now.

846
00:41:22,621 --> 00:41:26,357
Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen...
circle around to the left.

847
00:41:26,397 --> 00:41:27,387
Try to hit them from behind.

848
00:41:27,466 --> 00:41:29,903
Stiles, Dimitris...
watch our right flank.

849
00:41:31,777 --> 00:41:33,246
Right.

850
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,547
Seems like a perfect time
for a song.

851
00:41:35,586 --> 00:41:38,286
Wish I could think of one.

852
00:41:38,326 --> 00:41:40,763
Does anyone know a good song?!

853
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:42,529
Something rousing?!

854
00:41:42,569 --> 00:41:44,163
Too bad.

855
00:41:53,997 --> 00:41:55,728
Rebecca...

856
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:29,789
Major.

857
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:33,777
My earring clip.

858
00:42:33,811 --> 00:42:34,779
Where did you find it?

859
00:42:34,814 --> 00:42:36,648
In Maintenance Conduit 33-A.

860
00:42:36,684 --> 00:42:38,381
I guess it fell off
when you were doing

861
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:39,721
the deflector grid inspection.

862
00:42:39,759 --> 00:42:41,593
You must have searched
every crawl space

863
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,929
in the Central Core.

864
00:42:42,966 --> 00:42:44,094
Just doing my job.

865
00:42:44,136 --> 00:42:45,400
And doing it with style.

866
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:46,669
Glad to be of help.

867
00:42:48,847 --> 00:42:49,815
Cadet.

868
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,319
General.

869
00:42:51,353 --> 00:42:53,084
Now that's better.

870
00:42:53,124 --> 00:42:54,753
What was that all about?

871
00:42:54,795 --> 00:42:56,355
Respect.

872
00:42:59,372 --> 00:43:02,470
I'll say this for him,
he was a complicated man.

873
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:04,142
If you ask me, Eddington

874
00:43:04,184 --> 00:43:06,986
couldn't have picked
a better way to go...

875
00:43:07,024 --> 00:43:09,086
at least from his point of view.

876
00:43:10,231 --> 00:43:14,002
He was a romantic,
and what is more romantic

877
00:43:14,041 --> 00:43:17,311
than a glorious death
in defense of a lost cause?

878
00:43:17,382 --> 00:43:20,914
He died fighting
for what he believed in.

879
00:43:20,957 --> 00:43:24,193
I called him a traitor once

880
00:43:24,232 --> 00:43:28,105
but in a way, he was the
most loyal man I ever met.

881
00:43:28,141 --> 00:43:32,675
He was a Maquis...
right up to the bitter end.

882
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:34,815
Is that what this is?

883
00:43:34,858 --> 00:43:36,623
The end of the Maquis?

884
00:43:36,661 --> 00:43:38,632
Who knows?

885
00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:41,366
There could still be
more of them out there

886
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,208
hiding from the Dominion,
biding their time.

887
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:46,718
You almost sound hopeful.

888
00:43:46,752 --> 00:43:50,557
There is something attractive
about a lost cause.

889
00:43:50,595 --> 00:43:52,623
Maybe you have more
in common with Eddington

890
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:54,638
than you want to admit.

891
00:43:54,671 --> 00:43:56,231
Maybe.

892
00:43:57,478 --> 00:43:58,879
Good night, Benjamin.

893
00:43:58,915 --> 00:44:00,749
Get some rest.
