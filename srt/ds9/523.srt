1
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:12,680
Squid--
my favorite human food.

2
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,557
Mmm. Delicious, sir.

3
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,810
Mm-mmm.
Terrific as always, Dad.

4
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,854
I'm glad you like it.

5
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:21,647
Sir, if I may say so,

6
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:23,649
this sauce tastes
very familiar.

7
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:27,110
Well, it should.
It's purée
of tube grubs.

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,488
Oh! Tube grubs?

9
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:32,199
I figured if Nog is
willing to eat squid,

10
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:35,410
it's only fair that
we try tube grubs.

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,371
Besides, you said
it was terrific.

12
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,039
That was before
I knew what it was.

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,583
Eat. You need more meat
on your bones.

14
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,211
So, tell me, Nog,

15
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,087
how do you like
working security?

16
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,632
It's very
interesting, sir.

17
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:51,218
That's not
what you told me.
Jake.

18
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,636
Something wrong?

19
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:53,929
No, sir.

20
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,305
Everything's quite
satisfactory.

21
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,932
Thank you, sir.

22
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,058
Could've fooled me.

23
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:01,520
Cadet, if there's
a problem,

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,188
I want to hear about it.

25
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,857
(<i> sighs</i> )

26
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:06,775
Well, sir...

27
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,318
it's the Klingons, sir.

28
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,528
What about them?

29
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:12,113
It's their... attitude, sir.

30
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,115
It's bad.
Bad?

31
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:17,285
They're loud, obnoxious,
and if I may say so, sir,

32
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,038
generally intoxicated.

33
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:21,289
They walk around the station
like they own the place.

34
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:24,001
And whenever
a station security officer
tries to talk to them,

35
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,670
say, to ask them to keep
the noise level down

36
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,589
on the Promenade,
they ignore him.

37
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:29,965
You mean, they ignore<i> you.</i>

38
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:37,765
They never look me in the eye
when I try to talk to them, sir.

39
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:40,768
They just stare over my head
and pretend I'm not even there.

40
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:44,063
I hate when they do that.

41
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:47,733
I can see how that might
be annoying.

42
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,693
Not as annoying
as listening to him

43
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,236
complain about it
all the time.

44
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,989
Here is what I
suggest, Cadet.

45
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:57,076
The next time the Klingons
refuse to acknowledge
your presence,

46
00:01:57,076 --> 00:02:00,746
do what a Klingon would do.
Confront them about it.

47
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:03,665
If you stand up to them,
you'll earn their respect.

48
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:07,044
(<i> laughs</i> ):
Or get your butt kicked,
one or the other.

49
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,922
Either way,
they'll never ignore you again.

50
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:12,257
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Enter.

51
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,719
Captain, I need
to speak with you...

52
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,846
alone.

53
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:18,973
That does it.

54
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,976
Not now, Nog.

55
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:24,269
But, sir--
Come on, Nog.

56
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,938
Let's go...

57
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,734
Captain, my crew and I

58
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,987
were patrolling
the Cardassian border.

59
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:35,656
We intercepted
a very disturbing message.

60
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,198
This is a Maquis code.

61
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,409
I was as surprised
as you.

62
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,328
I thought the Maquis
were wiped out by Cardassia

63
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:44,581
and their new Dominion allies,
but it would appear...

64
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,291
I was mistaken.

65
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,918
Were you able
to decode it?

66
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,128
Mmm...

67
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:50,420
(<i> padd beeps</i> )

68
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,213
WOMAN:
Michael,

69
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,091
I hope you get this message.

70
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,426
We've launched the missiles.

71
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,013
They should reach Cardassia
in 13 days.

72
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:00,889
It may not bring back our dead,

73
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,809
but at least
they'll have a lot of company.

74
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,895
Did you detect any missiles?

75
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:10,983
No, but that proves nothing.

76
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,945
A few months ago,

77
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:20,492
the Klingon High Council
decided to aid the Maquis

78
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,452
in their fight
against Cardassia.

79
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:26,373
We provided them with
30 class-4 cloaking devices.

80
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,334
It was our understanding they
would use them on their ships.

81
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,629
But they could've been mounted
on the missiles instead.

82
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,464
You see the problem.

83
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,846
The Maquis had access
to tricobalt explosives,

84
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:44,432
biogenic weapons,
antimatter warheads--

85
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,977
The death toll
could be in the millions.

86
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,813
I knew that the Maquis
were desperate,

87
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:53,608
but I didn't believe
that they would resort
to something like this.

88
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,694
A sabre bear
is most deadly

89
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,446
when it is trapped
with no hope of escape.

90
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:01,658
Cardassia's
under Dominion protection.

91
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:05,245
If millions of their citizens
are killed by human terrorists,

92
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,039
they'll demand revenge.

93
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,209
And their Dominion allies
will see that they get it.

94
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:13,294
They'll launch a counterstrike
against the Federation,

95
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,172
the Klingon Empire,

96
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:18,008
and the entire Alpha Quadrant.

97
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:22,221
And start a war
that could destroy us all.

98
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,774
Report.

99
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,442
Do the words
"needle in a haystack"

100
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,111
mean anything to you?

101
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,863
We spent over 50 hours
searching the Badlands

102
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,990
for signs of the Maquis
missiles without success.

103
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,034
We would've stayed longer,
but we had a hard time

104
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,869
avoiding
the Jem'Hadar patrols.

105
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,705
Let me guess. They homed in
on your plasma wake.

106
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,750
Even though we were cloaked,
they were still able
to track us.

107
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,169
The<i> Defiant's</i> warp engines
are too powerful.

108
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,880
They ionize the nebular
gasses in the Badlands.

109
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,092
It's like a Ligorian mastodon
moving through the forest.

110
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,968
You may not be able to see it,

111
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,554
but it definitely makes
the leaves rustle.

112
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,098
I need answers, people.

113
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,016
If those missiles do exist,

114
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,018
they are only 11 days
from their target.

115
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,562
I need to know where they are
and how to stop them.

116
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:21,149
We need more information--
a way to narrow our search.

117
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,527
I think I know someone
who can help.

118
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,578
SISKO:
Eddington, wake up.

119
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,959
I'm dreaming, right?

120
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,668
This is a nightmare.

121
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,879
This is a nightmare,
all right

122
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,048
but you are wide awake.

123
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,509
I was wondering
when you'd show up.

124
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,346
I expected to see you here
weeks ago.

125
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,431
I've been busy.

126
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:53,848
But now you're here.

127
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,642
So enjoy yourself.

128
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,560
Savor the moment.

129
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,771
I know you've been wanting
to gloat over my defeat

130
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,398
for a long time.

131
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,817
I'm not here to gloat.
You deserve to.

132
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:08,822
You won. I betrayed Starfleet
by joining the Maquis.

133
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,741
You swore you'd track me down
and you did.

134
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,576
You got your revenge.

135
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:17,831
Actually, that's what I'm here
to talk about-- revenge.

136
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,000
One of my favorite topics.

137
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,549
I believe that was
intended for you.

138
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:34,514
Michael,
I hope you get this message.

139
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,767
We've launched the missiles.
They should reach Carda--

140
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,311
(<i> shuts off playback</i> )

141
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,146
Don't you want to hear
the rest of it?

142
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,898
Why should I?

143
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,067
It has nothing to do with me.

144
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,028
Michael is a very common name.

145
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:52,324
True, but somehow
I think you're the right one.

146
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,451
Guess again.

147
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:06,463
If those missiles hit Cardassia,
it could start a war.

148
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:09,590
Billions of people
will be killed.

149
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,844
If you expect me to shed a tear,

150
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:15,096
you're going to be disappointed.

151
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,557
I used up all my tears

152
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,726
when the Dominion
slaughtered the Maquis.

153
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,062
I sat here in this cell
for three days

154
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,938
and listened to the reports
as they came in.

155
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,982
In those three days,

156
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:30,778
everyone and everything
I cared about was wiped out.

157
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,948
I heard the same reports.
It was a tragedy.

158
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:37,702
Your generosity of spirit
touches me.

159
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:41,039
But you don't give a damn
about what happened to us,

160
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,709
and I don't give a damn
about what happens to you.

161
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,713
You may have taken off
the uniform,

162
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:52,342
but you're still
a Starfleet officer.
And<i> you</i> don't want a war

163
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:55,554
between the Federation
and the Dominion
any more than I do.

164
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:58,765
What you want and what I want
doesn't really matter.

165
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,641
There's nothing you can do

166
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,686
to stop those missiles
from hitting their targets.

167
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:07,690
They're cloaked,
highly maneuverable...

168
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,484
programmed to change course
at random.

169
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,194
You'll never find them.

170
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,780
Maybe we can't locate
the missiles,

171
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,575
but that doesn't mean
we can't stop them.

172
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:20,203
You must have programmed
in an abort code--

173
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:23,039
some way to deactivate
the missiles by remote.

174
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,417
Even if there was such a thing,

175
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:29,129
you'd have to transmit it
from the launch site.

176
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,965
And I don't think you're
going to find that either.

177
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:37,053
No code, no launch site.

178
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,931
I'm afraid you're
out of luck, Captain.

179
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,477
Looks like
everyone's out of luck.

180
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:51,192
(<i> chuckles</i> )

181
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,988
That's it?

182
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,158
You're just going to lie there
and do nothing.

183
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,701
That's what you do
when you're in prison--

184
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,830
nothing.
Just sit back and wait

185
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,166
for the next
counseling session...

186
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,627
the next
psychological evaluation...

187
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:10,211
the next rehabilitation
seminar.

188
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,172
What if I could get you
out of here?

189
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:15,133
Arrange a pardon
in exchange for your helping me?

190
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:18,178
Oh, you like this,
don't you, Ben?

191
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,973
You like deciding
the fate of others.
It makes you feel important.

192
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:25,393
It's not about me.
Do you want your freedom or not?

193
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:29,439
Freedom, huh? Tell me,
if they did release me,
where would I go?

194
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,774
What would I do?
Anything you want.

195
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,320
What about bringing the Maquis
back from the dead?

196
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,739
Can I do that?
Can you?

197
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,117
Can anyone?

198
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,910
No.

199
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,745
I didn't think so.

200
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,915
In that case,
I'll tell you what I want.

201
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,668
I want to lie here

202
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:52,587
until the Jem'Hadar
blow this place to pieces...

203
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:55,840
and me along with it.

204
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,228
Ah!

205
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,021
Careful. That hurts.

206
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,730
I haven't done
anything yet.

207
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,940
Well, what are you
waiting for?

208
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,192
I told you it hurts.

209
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,569
You'll survive.

210
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,529
Did you catch him?
We caught him.

211
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,114
Or rather, I should say
Major Kira caught him.

212
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,700
I didn't really
do anything.

213
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,784
I was in the Bajoran
shrine meditating,

214
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,996
and he burst in, stark-naked,
fell to his knees,

215
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,956
crying out to the Prophets
for protection.

216
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,709
Morn...
of all people.

217
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:33,127
Who would've thought
he'd just snap like that?

218
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,462
Certainly not me.

219
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,089
Which makes me wonder

220
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,841
what could've pushed
him over the edge.

221
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,553
Why are you looking at me?

222
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:44,347
I'm the victim here.
Huh.

223
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,182
He hit me
with a barstool.

224
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,184
<i>Why</i> did he hit you?

225
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,061
I don't have the faintest idea.

226
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,521
Think harder.

227
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,440
Witnesses say you
were talking to him

228
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,609
right up to the second
he went berserk.

229
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,485
Of course I was talking to him.

230
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,778
That's what bartenders
are supposed to do--

231
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,698
talk to their customers.

232
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:05,159
What exactly was it
that you were talking
to him about?

233
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:09,581
All I said was
that the military personnel
on this station

234
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:13,752
are starting to look
a little nervous.

235
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:16,170
And when they get nervous,
I get nervous.

236
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,797
And that's all you said?

237
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,841
Basically.

238
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:24,137
I might have done a little
harmless theorizing.

239
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,513
About what?

240
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,850
Oh, something like...

241
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,186
it was only a matter of time
before the Dominion

242
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,314
launched a full-scale assault
against the Federation,

243
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,107
and when that happened,

244
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:39,486
the station would undoubtedly
be their first target.

245
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:47,452
And I might have idly
suggested...

246
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,203
that there wasn't
a chance in hell

247
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,789
that any of us
would get out of here alive.

248
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,582
ODO:
And that's
when Morn hit you

249
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,501
with the barstool and
ran onto the Promenade

250
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,919
screaming,
"We're all doomed."

251
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,464
Some people just
don't react well to stress.

252
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,881
Ow!

253
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,134
DAX:
Ops to Major Kira.
Go ahead.

254
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,512
There's an incoming transmission
from Captain Sisko.

255
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,555
Be right there.
Probably wants to tell us

256
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,932
that the first wave
of Jem'Hadar is on the way.

257
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,310
Ha ha ha.

258
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,145
Very funny.

259
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,648
She's joking, right?

260
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:19,025
Ah!
Hold still.

261
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,943
My plan is to go
into the Badlands,

262
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,237
find the launch site
and deactivate those missiles.

263
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,072
You make it sound so easy.

264
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,158
You sure you don't want me
to send the<i> Defiant?</i>

265
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:29,619
The<i> Defiant</i> would just
attract unwanted attention.

266
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,621
Maybe, but I'd feel
a hell of a lot better

267
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,080
if you weren't out there alone.

268
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,708
Don't worry, Major.

269
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,209
I'm not alone.

270
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,058
Dinner.

271
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,227
What about these?

272
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,521
What about them?

273
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,690
Makes it
a little difficult to eat.

274
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,149
You'll manage.

275
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,317
(<i> snorts</i> )

276
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,072
Mmm.

277
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,366
Replicator entrée
number 103--

278
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:09,909
curried chicken and rice

279
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,245
with a side order
of carrots.

280
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,331
Or at least that's what
they want us to believe.

281
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,958
But you and I both know
what we're really eating--

282
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,128
replicated protein molecules
and textured carbohydrates.

283
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,174
Mmm, it's not that bad.

284
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,636
It may look like chicken,
but it still tastes

285
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,555
like replicated protein
molecules to me.

286
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:33,015
You don't want it,
don't eat it.

287
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,310
Remember
that Thanksgiving dinner

288
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,521
you cooked
for the senior staff last year?

289
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,273
How many months did
it take you to grow

290
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,483
all those vegetables
in the hydroponic garden?

291
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,945
Every ingredient fresh, real.

292
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,698
Though you did put too much
tarragon in the stuffing.

293
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:51,367
I wasn't aware
that you were a food critic.

294
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:55,204
I wasn't until I joined
the Maquis and started
eating real food.

295
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,124
Food that I'd grown
with my own hands.

296
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,584
Fresh corn,

297
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:03,421
sweet as a baby's smile,
and tomatoes...

298
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,965
Do you know how hard it is
to grow tomatoes?

299
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,134
There's always too much rain,
or not enough.

300
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,928
It's too hot.
It's too cold.

301
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,056
I wonder what happened
to those tomato plants.

302
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,311
Probably burned to the ground

303
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,020
along with everything else.

304
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,940
If we don't stop
those missiles,

305
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,775
a lot of things are going
to burn to the ground,

306
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:26,026
and not just on Cardassia.

307
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,571
You never give up,
do you, Ben?

308
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,865
Here we are having a pleasant
conversation about food,

309
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:33,075
and all you're thinking about
is the mission

310
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,119
and how to get me to cooperate.

311
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,788
You're wasting your breath.

312
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,415
As far as I'm concerned,
my life is over.

313
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,125
I'm dead.

314
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,506
For a dead man,
you talk a lot.

315
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,800
Then why didn't you
leave me in prison?

316
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,594
Because I have
a job to do,

317
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,304
and I can't do
it without you.

318
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,014
You're going to have to.

319
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,808
I told you when you
dragged me out of my cell

320
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,518
that I wasn't going
to help you.

321
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,645
I meant it then
and I mean it now.

322
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,981
I am trying
to prevent a war.

323
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:05,441
No, you're the one
who set the ground rules

324
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,860
when you came after me, Ben.

325
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,778
You're the one
who made it personal.

326
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,738
You could have looked
the other way.

327
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,867
You could have left
the Maquis alone,
but you didn't do it.

328
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,702
You hunted us, hounded us,

329
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,037
fought us
every chance you got,

330
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,665
and in the end, you set
us up for the slaughter.

331
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,793
I expected better of you
than that.

332
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:29,382
So did a lot of people...
people like Cal Hudson.

333
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,425
I bet you haven't heard
that name in a while.

334
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,386
You're right about that.

335
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,137
He told me the two of you were
friends at the Academy.

336
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,890
And a long time after.

337
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,307
Until he joined the Maquis.

338
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,101
He betrayed his oath
to Starfleet.

339
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,270
If it makes you
feel any better,

340
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,732
he paid for his sins.

341
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,776
He was killed in a skirmish
with the Cardassians.

342
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,032
He was a good man.

343
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,451
He felt the same about you.

344
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,829
He thought you were wrong
about the Maquis,

345
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,789
but he forgave you

346
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:05,001
which is ironic considering
you never forgave him.

347
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,211
You can't forgive
any of us.

348
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,213
And not because
we betrayed Starfleet

349
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,715
or the Federation,

350
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,467
but because
we betrayed<i> you.</i>

351
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,971
That's what this is
all about-- your ego.

352
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:19,766
Where Benjamin Sisko leads,
all must follow.

353
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,184
Is that what you
really believe?
It's the truth, isn't it?

354
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,687
The Maquis were never much
of a threat to the Federation,

355
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,731
but we were a threat to you.

356
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,983
We were a stain on your record,
and you couldn't have that,

357
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:32,695
not when you were so busy
measuring yourself for
an Admiral's uniform.

358
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:36,407
You want to blame me
for what happened
to the Maquis? Fine.

359
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:40,411
Go ahead. Blame me.
Blame Starfleet.
Blame the Federation.

360
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,789
Blame everyone except
Michael Eddington.

361
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,583
The Maquis won its
greatest victories
under<i> my</i> leadership.

362
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,461
Your leadership--
your shining
moment of glory.

363
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:52,006
Michael Eddington gets to
take off his gold uniform
and play hero.

364
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,758
That's what you
always wanted--

365
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:56,135
to lead troops in
a glorious cause.

366
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,346
Well, you had your chance,
and look where you led them.

367
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,307
Right into their graves.

368
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,726
They died because
I wasn't there when
they needed me most!

369
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,519
Because you put me in jail.

370
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,438
They died because
you filled their heads

371
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:10,024
with false hopes,
sold them dreams
of a military victory

372
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,652
when what they needed
was a negotiated peace.

373
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,320
We had the Cardassians
on the run.

374
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,072
And they ran
right into the arms

375
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,950
of the Dominion.
End of story.

376
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,160
Not quite the end.

377
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,371
That's right.
A few survivors of
your noble crusade

378
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:28,918
have decided to launch
a pointless retaliatory
strike against Cardassia.

379
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:31,629
It's not so pointless.
If you can't have victory,

380
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,965
sometimes you just have
to settle for revenge.

381
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:38,177
(<i> laughs</i> ):
Is that what you want?

382
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,346
To be remembered as the man
who helped bring about

383
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,057
the worst war
in Federation history?

384
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:46,268
Not quite the legacy I had
in mind, but I can live with it.

385
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,770
Can you?

386
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:14,130
(<i> grunting and growling</i> )

387
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,427
No, no, no.

388
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,055
You can do better than that.

389
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:23,806
You're barely making contact.

390
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:26,726
Again!

391
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,353
(<i> laughs</i> )

392
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,147
More wine!

393
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:34,358
I don't care
what anyone says.
That's got to hurt.

394
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,945
They're at 65 decibels--
loud, but not loud enough.

395
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,406
What are you
talking about?
Five more decibels,

396
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:43,910
and they'll be legally
disturbing the peace.
And then what?

397
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,120
And then I'm going to escort
them to a holding cell.

398
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,540
You're going
to arrest General Martok
for disturbing the peace?

399
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,250
I am.

400
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,378
Aren't you going to at least
call for backup?

401
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,547
Jake, you heard
what your father said.

402
00:20:56,547 --> 00:21:00,718
They won't respect me until
I stand up to them... alone.

403
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:04,680
(<i> sighs</i> )
Well, personally, I think
respect is overrated.

404
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,890
(<i> raucous laughter</i> )

405
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,391
That's it-- 70 decibels.

406
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,768
They're mine.

407
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,394
Whoa!

408
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:14,065
(<i> all laughing</i> )

409
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:16,567
You okay?
I'm fine.

410
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,485
Just tell me
when everyone leaves.

411
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,071
Why?

412
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,198
Because I'm not getting up
until they do.

413
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,209
SISKO:
Eddington.

414
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:39,173
Are we there yet?
Where?

415
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:42,135
That's the question,
isn't it?

416
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:45,179
There's something here
I want you to see.

417
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,806
I'll pass, thanks.

418
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:49,976
Suit yourself.

419
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:53,104
Maybe it's nothing.
(<i> console beeping</i> )

420
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:56,816
It is hard to get an accurate
sensor reading in the Badlands,

421
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,776
but unless I'm mistaken,

422
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:01,445
two Jem'Hadar warships
are headed our way.

423
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:07,952
Yeah. Those are Jem'Hadar
warships all right.

424
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,787
You've got a problem.

425
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,205
We both do.

426
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,749
Oh, they're coming closer.

427
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,043
One AU away.

428
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,755
Point nine AU.

429
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,008
You said you wanted to be blown
to pieces by the Jem'Hadar?

430
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,927
Well, it looks
like you're going
to get your wish.

431
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,181
I have faith in you, Captain.

432
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:29,974
You'll get us out of this.

433
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,478
Not me, Mr. Eddington.

434
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,774
I don't know the
Badlands that well,

435
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,818
but you do.

436
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,238
Where are you going?
To get a<i> raktajino.</i>

437
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:45,614
Now?

438
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,284
Throat's a little dry.

439
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,203
One<i> raktajino.</i>

440
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:51,662
You're crazy.

441
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,247
They're almost on top of us.

442
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,793
One thing I will say
about these replicators.

443
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,962
They sure know how
to make Klingon coffee.

444
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:02,548
(<i> console beeping</i> )
They're scanning us.

445
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,968
They should be in firing range
any minute now.

446
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:08,346
Very clever, Captain,
but it's not going to work.

447
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:10,681
I am not going to take the helm.

448
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,141
Suit yourself.

449
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,809
(<i> console beeping</i> )

450
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:17,230
That is what you're
trying to do.
Isn't it?

451
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:21,275
I'm trying to see
how serious your
death wish really is.

452
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,819
I'm betting
that it doesn't even exist,

453
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,364
just like I'm betting that you
won't be able to sit back

454
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:28,074
and let your friends
start a war

455
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:30,492
that could destroy
the Alpha Quadrant.

456
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,078
That's an awfully big bet.

457
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,411
I don't think so.

458
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:35,622
(<i> console beeping</i> )

459
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,457
Point seven AU.

460
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:48,052
Can you lose them?

461
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:51,180
I plotted a spiral course
around a plasma filament.

462
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,515
It should dissipate
our warp signature.

463
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,975
Very fancy.

464
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,019
You can take over now.

465
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,729
Hmm.

466
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:01,023
No.

467
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:02,942
I don't think so.

468
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:05,194
Let's get one thing
straight, Captain.

469
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,862
I'll get you to the launch site

470
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,240
and I'll help you deactivate
those missiles.

471
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,410
But then you and I
are going to have it out--
once and for all.

472
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,995
You want a fight, mister--
I will give you one.

473
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,873
I don't intend
to fight you, Captain.

474
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,251
I intend to kill you.

475
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,468
Captain,
when I joined the Maquis,

476
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:33,639
I left some personal items
behind on the station.

477
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:37,435
As far as I know,
all your things
were put in storage.

478
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:41,563
You didn't happen to
see an old Earth coin
about this big...

479
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,523
with a bird on the front?

480
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:44,817
A bird?

481
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,319
A loon, actually.

482
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,820
My lucky looney.

483
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,323
It's an old
Canadian coin.

484
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:52,490
Been in the family
for over 200 years.

485
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,577
It's probably
in some locker
in the Assay Office

486
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,871
along with the rest
of your things.

487
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,123
I hope so.

488
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:01,250
I'd hate to think I'd lost it.

489
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,294
(<i> beeping</i> )

490
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:05,254
Speaking of things
you thought you'd lost...

491
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,595
There's no way
those Jem'Hadar ships
could have tracked us.

492
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,223
Obviously there is.
Can we lose them again?

493
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,976
Dissipating our warp
signature didn't work.

494
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:21,145
Don't tell me the Maquis
didn't have Plan "B."

495
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:23,272
You're not going
to like it.

496
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:26,442
Half an AU and closing.
If you do have a plan,

497
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,361
I guarantee
I'll learn to love it.

498
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:29,695
We're going to have to realign

499
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,489
the impulse flow regulators.

500
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:32,739
You mean shut down the engines?

501
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,532
They'll be on us in a second.

502
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:36,952
Who said anything about
shutting down the engines?

503
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,620
You're thinking about
realigning the emitter

504
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,206
while the engines
are engaged--

505
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,748
one wrong move
and the flow regulators

506
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,083
will blow up
in your face.

507
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,793
You mean, in<i> your</i> face.

508
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,213
I'll be piloting the ship.

509
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:49,256
When you finish, we can
use the impulse exhaust

510
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,050
to detonate the plasma
field behind us.

511
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,593
Even if the Jem'Hadar
survive the blast,

512
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:56,180
the shock wave should wipe out
any trace of our ion wake.

513
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,639
(<i> console beeping</i>
<i>insistently)</i>

514
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,557
Point four AU and closing.

515
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,435
You'd better get started.

516
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:04,562
All right,
but hold the ship steady.

517
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,482
I don't want any accidents.

518
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,108
I'll do my best.

519
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,860
Hmm.

00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,755
while engines are engaged
is not recommended.

522
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:32,258
Tell me something I don't know.

523
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,800
Disengage safeties.

524
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,803
Authorization:
Sisko-A-four-seven-one.

525
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,596
Acknowledged.

526
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,974
Safeties disengaged.

527
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,151
(<i> gasping</i> )

528
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,610
Damn it, Eddington.

529
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,321
I told you
to hold the ship steady.

530
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,822
Sorry, Captain.

531
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,615
We ran into a pocket
of boron gas.

532
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:59,076
Well, don't do it again.

533
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,295
EDDINGTON:
You still there, Captain?

534
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:10,628
Disappointed?

535
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,214
Just checking.

536
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,049
Captain, I hate to rush you,

537
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,633
but things are going
to get very unpleasant

538
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:17,136
if we don't get out
of here soon.

539
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,263
I'm aware of the problem.

540
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:22,391
Eddington!

541
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:25,478
That wasn't me.
They're firing at us.

542
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:27,605
Well, in that case...

543
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:29,607
let her rip!

544
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,949
(<i> groaning</i> )

545
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:49,001
Well, that got
the adrenaline pumping.

546
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,920
No sign of the Jem'Hadar.

547
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,340
Looks like
we lost them, Captain.

548
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,885
Captain?

549
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,889
Computer, locate Captain Sisko.

550
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:05,142
Internal sensors are off-line.

551
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:06,435
Of course they are.

552
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:11,106
I told you
to keep the ship steady!

553
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,066
You're alive.
What a pleasant surprise.

554
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,818
I'm sure.

555
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,654
Now get us
to the launch site!

556
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,575
(<i> sighs</i> )

557
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:31,335
JAKE:
I understand, but all
I'm saying, Nog,

558
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,045
is the next time you know
I have a girl over,

559
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,505
just call me
before you come home.

560
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:36,089
The two of you
were only talking.

561
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,466
Well, you never know.

562
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,092
Jake, I know
your track record.

563
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,802
You<i> never</i> get
past talking.

564
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,804
Now, that's
a scurrilous lie.
"Scurrilous"?

565
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,473
Is that worse
than a regular lie?

566
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,266
Look, I don't know
what the big deal is.

567
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,685
Just check before
you come home, okay?

568
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:49,603
Okay. And you
do the same.

569
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,689
Nog, you haven't had a date
since you left the Academy--

570
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:53,106
unless you're
counting holosuites.

571
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,402
Now who's being
scurrilous?

572
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:57,986
(<i> laughing</i> )

573
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,322
I don't believe this.
What's wrong?

574
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:03,325
They're loitering
on the Promenade
in our old spot.

575
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:05,202
I guess they
know a good view
when they see one.

576
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:06,870
Jake, don't you get it?

577
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,955
They know I'm territorial
about that spot.

578
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:11,584
They're purposely doing
this to insult me.

579
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:14,794
Nog, you are definitely
getting stranger
as you get older.

580
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,838
I can't let them
do this to me.

581
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,340
Stay back, Jake.

582
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,175
This could get ugly.

583
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,430
(<i> chortling</i> )

584
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:27,891
All right, it's time
for you to move along.

585
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:31,103
We will decide
when it is time to move.

586
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:35,524
Station regulation
82/7-B clearly states

587
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,859
that loitering
on the Promenade
is prohibited.

588
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,111
Is that so?!

589
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,154
It is! Now,
either move

590
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,616
or I'm going to have to
place you under arrest.

591
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:47,035
You are either very brave...

592
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,955
or very stupid, Ferengi.

593
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,416
Probably a little of both.

594
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,337
(<i> laughing</i> )

595
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,465
Indeed...

596
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:02,342
Courage comes
in all sizes.

597
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,178
But don't tempt fate.

598
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,389
<i>khi-GOSH.</i>

599
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,851
Nog, I'm impressed.

600
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,230
Klingons--

601
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,733
you just have to know
how to handle them.

602
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:18,942
(<i> laughs</i> )

603
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,361
(<i> sighs</i> )

604
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,793
Next stop: Athos IV...

605
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:37,877
a grim little fogbound
piece of rock

606
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:39,879
in the middle
of nowhere.

607
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:42,508
What better place to hide
a missile launching site?

608
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:44,176
<i>We</i> thought so.

609
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:49,348
The sensors aren't
detecting anything.

610
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,475
That's the general idea.

611
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,352
There's too much
interference

612
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,020
to detect anything...

613
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,147
but it's there.

614
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,191
We'll never get a transporter
through all that static.

615
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,651
We don't need to.

616
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:02,027
There's a shuttle pad

617
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,737
not far from
the launch site.

618
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,280
Then take us down.

619
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,627
How far?

620
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:20,170
A few kilometers.

621
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,880
This tunnel will take us
most of the way.

622
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,256
These tunnels
are man-made.

623
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,424
I know.

624
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,967
I helped dig them myself.

625
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,319
Now where?
(<i> sighs</i> )

626
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,821
Give me a minute
to get my bearings.

627
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,239
It's been a while.

628
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,867
(<i> faint clattering</i> )

629
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:51,785
You hear something?

630
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,338
MALE (<i> faintly</i> ):
This area is secure.

631
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,272
These barrels
are made of duridium.

632
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,274
That should hold them off
for a while.

633
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,526
I thought you said
the Jem'Hadar would never
find this place.

634
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:28,196
I didn't think they would.
I was wrong.

635
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,449
I say we rush them.
In this fog,

636
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:32,534
they'll have as much chance
of hitting each other
as hitting us.

637
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,411
Too risky.
You never would have made it

638
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:35,995
in the Maquis
with that kind of attitude.

639
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,039
It's not me that I'm worried
about, it's you.

640
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,958
If you get killed, there'll be
no way to stop those missiles.

641
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,669
Take this. I'll go around,
try to draw their fire.

642
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,880
You should be able
to catch them off guard
when they come after me.

643
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,548
I can barely see two
meters in front of me.

644
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,091
How will I know
what I'm aiming at?

645
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,843
I'll be the one holding
the pipe.

646
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:51,720
Attacking two Jem'Hadar
soldiers with a pipe--

647
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,639
that's a brilliant plan.
It could be worse.

648
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,515
I know-- it could be
me holding the pipe.

649
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,183
Exactly.

650
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,727
(<i> weapons fire continues</i> )

651
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:03,273
(<i> metallic clink</i> )

652

(<i> grunting</i> )

656
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:45,315
You have sharp eyes.
Not really.

657
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:47,275
I just waited to see
which of you was
knocked down first

658
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,027
and then I shot the one
still standing.

659
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,946
Thank you for your vote
of confidence.

660
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:53,198
Now help me drag these
bodies over to the well.

661
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,200
Maybe that way, the other
Jem'Hadar will look

662
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,202
for their friends,
and not us.

663
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,006
In a couple of minutes,
this entire settlement

664
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:10,674
is going to be crawling
with Jem'Hadar.

665
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:12,676
I suggest you get us
to the launch site now.

666
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:14,219
That way.

667
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,555
Are you sure?
Reasonably.

668
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:37,784
We're close.

669
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,369
Then let's keep moving.

670
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,416
Wait.

671
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,219
Vance.

672
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,554
You knew him?

673
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:01,099
He was a shuttle pilot.

674
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,726
And a friend.

675
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,019
There are more.

676
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,298
This wasn't supposed to happen.

677
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,717
We were winning.

678
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:40,472
The Cardassian Empire
was falling into chaos.

679
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,390
The Maquis colonies
were going

680
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,060
to declare themselves
an independent nation.

681
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,604
Eddington, listen to me.

682
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,732
This is not the time...

683
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:53,318
It's over.
It's not over.

684
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:55,361
We still have to stop
those missiles.

685
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,280
That's all you
care about?

686
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,032
The missiles?

687
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:01,034
It's too late for us
to help these people,

688
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:02,911
but if we don't stop
the missiles,

689
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:04,579
this will just be the beginning.

690
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,748
I was their leader.

691
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:10,043
I was responsible for them
and I failed.

692
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:12,629
I failed them all.

693
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:14,798
Maybe we all failed them.

694
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:18,217
Maybe we could have prevented
this from happening.
I don't know.

695
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,219
It's going
to take a long time

696
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,680
and a lot
of soul-searching

697
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,890
before I find the answer

698
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:27,352
but right now, we have
a mission to complete.

699
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:32,524
I wish I knew for certain

700
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,442
that killing you
would make me feel better,

701
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,904
but I suppose that can wait
for another time.

702
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:48,748
That's it.
Are you sure?

703
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,416
You want to stand here
and argue about it?

704
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,835
Come on, it looks clear.

705
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:52,878
Wait.

706
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,799
(<i> yelling</i> )

707
00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:00,385
I'm glad one of us
remembered they
could do that.

708
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:07,017
(<i> mechanism beeping</i> )

709
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:09,061
No, wait.
I don't want to damage
any of the equipment.

710
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,645
Let me try something.

711
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,535
Michael...

712
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:27,286
I wondered
when you'd get here.

713
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,458
I came as soon
as I could.

714
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,796
Captain Sisko...

715
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:39,591
I'd like you to meet
Rebecca Sullivan,

716
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:41,426
my wife.

717
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,812
We're getting out of here.
We've got a runabout
hidden at the landing site.

718
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,607
We can still
access the tunnels
through the old well.

719
00:37:55,607 --> 00:38:00,486
Stick together.
Try not to lose each other
in the fog, hmm?

720
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:03,364
Wait a minute.
What about disarming
the missiles?

721
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:06,868
Look around you, Ben.
Does this look
like a launch site?

722
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,828
Eddington, I want
the truth<i> now.</i>

723
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,455
There never were any missiles,

724
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,832
no retaliatory strike
against Cardassia.

725
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:16,502
It was all a ploy,
a way to let Michael know
that we'd made it here.

726
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:19,380
This was
our fallback position,

727
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,841
but I needed your help
to evacuate these people.

728
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:25,053
What would you have done
if I hadn't forced
you to come with me?

729
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,805
I would have volunteered.

730
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:31,059
You should be smiling, Ben.

731
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:34,980
That Dominion counterstrike
you were so worried about--

732
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,898
it's not going to happen.

733
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,819
Yes, you're right.

734
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,279
That is good news,

735
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:46,158
but I still don't
like being lied to.

736
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,247
Well, I hope you're ready
to finish what you started.

737
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,291
Michael, we don't
have time for this.

738
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:56,209
We'll finish this later.

739
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:57,669
SULLIVAN:
All right.

740
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,378
You heard what Michael said.

741
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,505
Stick together.

742
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,265
You should have told me
the truth.

743
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,184
If I had known the Jem'Hadar
were going to be here,

744
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:13,810
I would have
brought more men.

745
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,603
The Jem'Hadar weren't
supposed to be here.

746
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,647
No one knew about
this base but us.

747
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:26,114
They landed
three days ago.

748
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:27,699
We tried to fight--
I know.

749
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,034
I saw the bodies.

750
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,451
I thought
for a while there--

751
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,245
I didn't think
I'd make it either,

752
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:34,413
but they kept all
the leaders alive.

753
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,874
They were going to
make a present of us

754
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,917
to the Cardassian
government.

755
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,628
Now I guess we'll end up
in a Federation prison.

756
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,339
No, we're not going
to prison--

757
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:44,049
not if I have anything
to say about it.

758
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:45,633
Right now, I suggest
you concentrate

759
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,135
on getting off this planet.

760
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,553
We can worry
about the rest later.

761
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,429
There's nothing
to worry about.

762
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:53,016
You're not going to put us
in prison, not this time.

763
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:55,977
Damn it, you never give up,
do you, Mr. Eddington?

764
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,436
Never.

765
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,481
(<i> yells</i> )

766
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:03,360
SISKO:
Move!

767
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:10,658
Go! Whatever happens, don't stop
until you get to the runabout.

768
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,285
(<i> weapons fire</i> )

769
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:15,330
You, too.
I'm staying with you.

770
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,957
I'll be right
behind you.

771
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,084
Now get going.

772
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:26,216
I didn't know
you were married.

773
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:28,134
We held the ceremony
two weeks before
you captured me.

774
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,802
Not much of a honeymoon.

775
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,806
I suggest we
fall back, now.

776
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,101
For once, you'll get
no argument from me.

777
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:40,479
(<i> grunts</i> )

778
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,898
Go!

779
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,363
You'd better get
to the runabout.
What about you?

780
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:51,241
I'd only slow you down.
Just get Rebecca
and the others to safety.

781
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:52,700
I'm not going to let you just--

782
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,493
Go!

783
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:58,539
Mr. Eddington, you are
one stubborn, headstrong--

784
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:01,376
I told you only one of us
would be coming back
from this mission.

785
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:11,261
Where's Michael?
He's not coming.

786
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:13,805
What do you mean,
he's not coming?

787
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,265
Rebecca...

788
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:19,018
we have to go-- now.

789
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,653
Okay, Crenshaw, Yuen--
circle around to the left.

790
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,363
Try to hit them from behind.

791
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:32,740
Stiles, Dimitris--
watch our right flank.

792
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,533
(<i> groans</i> )

793
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,161
Right.

794
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:38,455
Seems like a perfect time
for a song.

795
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:41,333
Wish I could think of one.

796
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,376
Does anyone know a good song?!

797
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,170
Something rousing?!

798
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,963
Too bad.

799
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:50,633
(<i> groaning</i> )

800
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,557
Rebecca...

801
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:32,758
Major.

802
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,389
My earring clip.
Where did you find it?

803
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:39,307
In Maintenance
Conduit 33-A.

804
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:40,850
I guess it fell off
when you were doing

805
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,519
the deflector
grid inspection.

806
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:44,396
You must have searched
every crawlspace

807
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:45,730
in the Central Core.

808
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:46,939
Just doing my job.

809
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,358
And doing it
with style.

810
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:49,650
Glad to be of help.

811
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:54,155
Cadet.
General.

812
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:56,074
Now that's better.

813
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:57,783
What was that
all about?

814
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,411
Respect.

815
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,331
DAX:
I'll say this for him

816
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:05,166
he was a complicated man.

817
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,043
If you ask me, Eddington

818
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,712
couldn't have picked
a better way to go...

819
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,924
at least from his point of view.

820
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:16,594
He was a romantic,
and what is more romantic

821
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:20,639
than a glorious death
in defense of a lost cause?

822
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:24,143
He died fighting
for what he believed in.

823
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:27,230
I called him a traitor once,

824
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:31,234
but in a way, he was
the most loyal man I ever met.

825
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:35,321
He was a Maquis...
right up to the bitter end.

826
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,407
Is that what this is?

827
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,284
The end of the Maquis?

828
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:41,327
Who knows?

829
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:44,038
There could still be
more of them out there,

830
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,832
hiding from the Dominion,
biding their time.

831
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:49,252
You almost sound hopeful.

832
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:53,172
There is something attractive
about a lost cause.

833
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,300
Maybe you have more
in common with Eddington

834
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,260
than you want to admit.

835
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,886
Maybe.

836
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:01,639
Good night, Benjamin.

837
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,391
Get some rest.
