1
00:00:08,716 --> 00:00:11,349
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

2
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,862
It's a little quiet in here.

3
00:00:13,897 --> 00:00:16,028
Oh, you just beat the rush.

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,044
Uh, let me get your order
before, uh...

5
00:00:19,078 --> 00:00:20,708
before I get swamped.

6
00:00:20,749 --> 00:00:22,549
I'll have a Til'amin froth.

7
00:00:22,588 --> 00:00:23,887
I'll have a...

8
00:00:25,763 --> 00:00:27,233
What was that?

9
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:28,896
What was what?!

10
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:30,934
Oh, that!
That's, uh...

11
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,686
just my nephew and Chief O'Brien

12
00:00:34,722 --> 00:00:35,713
repairing some conduit.

13
00:00:35,758 --> 00:00:36,749
You'll get used to it.

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,498
The Klingon restaurant.

15
00:00:40,538 --> 00:00:42,304
It would be quieter.

16
00:00:51,335 --> 00:00:53,900
When are you two going
to be done in there?

17
00:00:53,942 --> 00:00:55,572
When the conduit is repaired

18
00:00:55,614 --> 00:00:57,813
and brought back up
to safety specs.

19
00:00:57,853 --> 00:01:00,087
Well, hurry up before I
lose all my customers.

20
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,322
I need to get something.

21
00:01:01,363 --> 00:01:03,358
What?

22
00:01:03,402 --> 00:01:05,168
Two root beers.

23
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,085
Aah...

24
00:01:13,664 --> 00:01:15,659
Hyperspanner.

25
00:01:21,687 --> 00:01:23,682
Optronic coupler.

26
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,851
How did you know
I was going to ask

27
00:01:35,893 --> 00:01:37,363
for a phase decompiler?

28
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:38,890
I was paying attention, sir.

29
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:40,633
That you were, Cadet.

30
00:01:40,673 --> 00:01:42,736
My father says I can
learn a lot from you.

31
00:01:42,779 --> 00:01:44,374
He says you can fix anything.

32
00:01:44,484 --> 00:01:46,479
I'm an engineer.

33
00:01:46,522 --> 00:01:48,083
That's what we do.

34
00:01:48,127 --> 00:01:50,190
There.

35
00:01:50,233 --> 00:01:52,832
Good as new.

36
00:01:52,874 --> 00:01:54,344
Amazing.

37
00:01:56,785 --> 00:01:57,776
Damn!

38
00:01:57,821 --> 00:01:59,188
We repaired
the leak right away

39
00:01:59,224 --> 00:02:00,751
but the problem was
worse than I thought.

40
00:02:00,796 --> 00:02:03,736
The entire plasma distribution
manifold is shot.

41
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:04,932
Can you replicate a new one?

42
00:02:04,975 --> 00:02:09,352
No. Cardassian manifolds
use a beta-matrix compositor

43
00:02:09,386 --> 00:02:11,050
which can't be replicated.

44
00:02:11,092 --> 00:02:12,960
Well, I suppose we could
contact Gul Dukat

45
00:02:12,997 --> 00:02:14,558
and ask him if he has

46
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,575
any spare manifold
systems lying around.

47
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:19,740
I'm sure he'd jump
at the chance to help us.

48
00:02:19,782 --> 00:02:21,309
Any other ideas?

49
00:02:21,353 --> 00:02:23,221
We could send a salvage team

50
00:02:23,258 --> 00:02:24,819
to the abandoned
Cardassian station

51
00:02:24,863 --> 00:02:26,059
in the Trivas system.

52
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,126
Empok Nor.

53
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:28,764
It's the same design
as this station.

54
00:02:28,807 --> 00:02:30,675
The Cardassians
pulled out about a year ago

55
00:02:30,713 --> 00:02:31,807
but there's good chance

56
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:34,414
that the plasma manifold system
is still operational.

57
00:02:34,457 --> 00:02:36,725
What about Dominion activity
in the area?

58
00:02:36,763 --> 00:02:38,894
There hasn't been any
for several months.

59
00:02:38,936 --> 00:02:40,200
Strategically, they seem

60
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,211
to have lost interest
in that sector.

61
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,875
But there is one problem.

62
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:46,482
It's standard
Cardassian procedure

63
00:02:46,523 --> 00:02:49,190
to booby-trap a facility
before abandoning it

64
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:51,830
and a lot of the surprises
they leave behind

65
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:54,778
are specifically keyed
to attack non-Cardassians.

66
00:02:54,813 --> 00:02:57,982
Sounds like you should
take a Cardassian along.

67
00:02:58,022 --> 00:03:00,517
So, what did Captain Sisko do
to persuade you to come along?

68
00:03:00,596 --> 00:03:01,963
How do you know
I didn't volunteer?

69
00:03:03,003 --> 00:03:04,131
He threatened you, didn't he?

70
00:03:04,173 --> 00:03:05,142
Nothing so coarse.

71
00:03:05,176 --> 00:03:06,236
The Captain bribed me.

72
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:07,248
He offered to help me

73
00:03:07,282 --> 00:03:09,254
procure a larger space
for my workshop.

74
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:12,421
The latest dressmaking equipment
is surprisingly bulky.

75
00:03:12,463 --> 00:03:14,526
Well, whatever he did,
I'm glad you're here.

76
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,167
What's the matter?

77
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:18,873
Well, it's just that lately

78
00:03:18,914 --> 00:03:21,386
I've noticed everyone
seems to trust me.

79
00:03:21,421 --> 00:03:22,390
It's quite unnerving.

80
00:03:22,424 --> 00:03:24,088
I'm still trying
to get used to it.

81
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:26,499
Next thing I know, people
are going to be inviting me

82
00:03:26,535 --> 00:03:27,731
to their homes for dinner.

83
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:29,367
Well, if it makes
you feel any better

84
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,040
I promise I will
never have you over.

85
00:03:31,081 --> 00:03:32,209
I appreciate that, Chief.

86
00:03:32,251 --> 00:03:33,242
Ah, don't mention it.

87
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:35,921
Anything to return the favor.

88
00:03:35,962 --> 00:03:37,489
Disarming
Cardassian booby traps

89
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:39,562
is my least favorite
kind of engineering.

90
00:03:39,606 --> 00:03:41,578
I can certainly understand that

91
00:03:41,611 --> 00:03:42,580
but don't worry.

92
00:03:42,614 --> 00:03:44,916
I have some experience
in that area.

93
00:03:44,953 --> 00:03:46,389
Booby traps?

94
00:03:46,424 --> 00:03:48,054
I can't believe
I let you talk me

95
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,463
into volunteering for this.

96
00:03:49,499 --> 00:03:50,468
Well, it beats

97
00:03:50,502 --> 00:03:52,599
working on the waste
extraction system.

98
00:03:52,642 --> 00:03:54,408
Besides, how often
does an engineer

99
00:03:54,446 --> 00:03:55,779
get to wear a phaser?

100
00:03:55,817 --> 00:03:57,310
Hate to disappoint you, Pechetti

101
00:03:57,354 --> 00:03:59,826
but the only thing you're
going to be using that for

102
00:03:59,862 --> 00:04:01,092
is shooting voles.

103
00:04:01,132 --> 00:04:03,400
Empok Nor's been
abandoned so long

104
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:04,464
they're going to be hungry.

105
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,382
Don't worry.

106
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:08,579
You play with your wrenches.

107
00:04:08,653 --> 00:04:10,123
We'll watch your backs.

108
00:04:18,113 --> 00:04:20,517
Can I help you, Cadet?

109
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:22,421
I'm reporting for duty...

110
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:24,795
sir.

111
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:25,994
Welcome aboard, Cadet.

112
00:04:26,035 --> 00:04:27,334
Thank you, sir.

113
00:04:27,372 --> 00:04:29,640
And may I say, it's a privilege
to be here, sir.

114
00:04:29,746 --> 00:04:31,649
You've earned it.

115
00:04:31,684 --> 00:04:33,918
But one more "sir,"
and I'll leave you behind.

116
00:04:33,957 --> 00:04:36,156
Very well, s... Chief.

117
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:39,136
Let's get going.

118
00:04:39,172 --> 00:04:40,334
Next stop: Empok Nor.

119
00:06:47,126 --> 00:06:48,459
What are you doing?

120
00:06:48,496 --> 00:06:49,760
Regrouping.

121
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:51,292
But you're losing.

122
00:06:51,337 --> 00:06:53,639
That's why I need
to protect my assets.

123
00:06:53,676 --> 00:06:55,944
This is not
a financial transaction.

124
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:57,043
Protecting your assets

125
00:06:57,086 --> 00:06:59,081
is what got you into trouble
in the first place.

126
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,120
You have to go on the offensive.

127
00:07:01,198 --> 00:07:02,759
You have to attack.

128
00:07:02,802 --> 00:07:03,828
Your move.

129
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:05,536
Oh, this is maddening.

130
00:07:05,577 --> 00:07:08,814
Asking a Ferengi
to play a Cardassian game

131
00:07:08,853 --> 00:07:10,756
is like asking a Klingon

132
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:13,093
to chew
with his mouth closed.

133
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:16,573
Kotra is not about "regrouping"
or hoarding "assets."

134
00:07:16,607 --> 00:07:20,140
It's about bold strategy
and decisive action.

135
00:07:20,184 --> 00:07:22,554
Chief, would you like
to take on the winner?

136
00:07:22,591 --> 00:07:25,725
I'd love to play kotra
against the hero

137
00:07:25,766 --> 00:07:26,826
of Setlik III.

138
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:28,396
What is that supposed to mean?

139
00:07:28,441 --> 00:07:31,040
Oh, we all know
your distinguished war record...

140
00:07:31,081 --> 00:07:34,352
how you led two dozen men
against the Barrica encampment

141
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,364
and took out an entire
regiment of Cardassians.

142
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:40,100
If you play kotra
with half that brazenness

143
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,507
we'd have quite a match.

144
00:07:41,543 --> 00:07:43,742
I'm not a soldier anymore.

145
00:07:43,783 --> 00:07:44,843
I'm an engineer.

146
00:07:44,886 --> 00:07:46,116
I see.

147
00:07:46,157 --> 00:07:48,892
So when you and Dr. Bashir
go into the holosuites

148
00:07:48,931 --> 00:07:51,666
for hours at a time,
you're just repairing them?

149
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:53,267
What's your point, Garak?

150
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,370
I'm just curious.

151
00:07:54,413 --> 00:07:55,883
Why do you and Dr. Bashir

152
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:59,051
spend hours in the holosuites,
dressed as fighter pilots

153
00:07:59,093 --> 00:08:00,529
reliving ancient battles?

154
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,500
We... do it for fun.

155
00:08:02,536 --> 00:08:04,508
It's a game.

156
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:06,445
And so is kotra.

157
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,590
And I'd love nothing more

158
00:08:11,627 --> 00:08:13,758
than to play
against a man like you.

159
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,772
Maybe some other time.

160
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:22,825
Chief, here's the
wish list you wanted.

161
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,829
Three categories.

162
00:08:23,862 --> 00:08:26,096
"Must-have"...which
includes the manifolds

163
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:27,263
and plasma recoilers.

164
00:08:27,305 --> 00:08:30,302
"Could-use"...things like,
uh, EPS matrix converters.

165
00:08:30,347 --> 00:08:31,475
And "would-be-nice"...

166
00:08:31,517 --> 00:08:33,580
bypass displacers,
polarity maximizers

167
00:08:33,623 --> 00:08:35,720
that sort of thing.

168
00:08:35,762 --> 00:08:38,132
Cardassian emblems
and insignias?

169
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:42,010
Well, a low priority,
but if we happen to find some...

170
00:08:42,046 --> 00:08:44,075
This is a salvage operation,
Pechetti

171
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:47,288
not an opportunity to indulge
your collecting obsession.

172
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:48,557
Right.

173
00:09:03,372 --> 00:09:05,172
Approaching Empok Nor, sir.

174
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,342
Take us out of warp.

175
00:09:07,384 --> 00:09:08,751
Run a full scan.

176
00:09:08,787 --> 00:09:10,451
I'll take the helm.

177
00:09:10,492 --> 00:09:12,224
The station's main power supply

178
00:09:12,264 --> 00:09:14,361
and life-support systems
are off-line.

179
00:09:14,436 --> 00:09:16,270
No life signs.

180
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:17,904
I'll take us
into transporter range.

181
00:09:17,946 --> 00:09:19,918
Oh, I don't think we can
risk beaming aboard.

182
00:09:19,952 --> 00:09:23,121
There are probably pattern
scramblers rigged to go off

183
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:26,227
if they detect a non-Cardassian
transporter signal.

184
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:27,864
That could be messy.

185
00:09:27,907 --> 00:09:29,400
We'll have to dock.

186
00:09:29,512 --> 00:09:31,346
Landing pads are sealed.

187
00:09:31,384 --> 00:09:33,856
We'll have to try
an upper pylon.

188
00:09:33,891 --> 00:09:35,418
Won't the airlock
have booby traps?

189
00:09:35,495 --> 00:09:36,725
You can count on it.

190
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:40,036
And someone's going to have
to disarm them before we dock.

191
00:09:40,075 --> 00:09:41,545
I volunteer, sir.

192
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:44,918
The scanner in the airlock
might mistake your enthusiasm

193
00:09:44,955 --> 00:09:47,656
as Cardassian...
but not your DNA.

194
00:09:47,696 --> 00:09:49,793
No, I'm afraid I'm the only one

195
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:51,203
who has a chance
of getting through.

196
00:11:14,672 --> 00:11:17,305
Ah, welcome to Empok Nor.

197
00:11:17,347 --> 00:11:18,646
Thanks for having us.

198
00:11:18,717 --> 00:11:20,244
Take whatever you need.

199
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:21,952
My house is your house.

200
00:11:22,962 --> 00:11:24,090
All right, listen up.

201
00:11:24,132 --> 00:11:27,163
We're going to break up
into three teams.

202
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,145
Nog and Stolzoff,
you're with me.

203
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:30,581
We'll do the "must-haves."

204
00:11:30,617 --> 00:11:33,216
Pechetti and Amaro,
you'll do the "could-use."

205
00:11:33,258 --> 00:11:36,130
Boq'ta and Garak...
"would-be-nice."

206
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,161
Garak has disabled
the central security net

207
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:39,835
but there could be
booby traps anywhere.

208
00:11:39,877 --> 00:11:42,715
Don't move into an area
until you've scanned it.

209
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,551
If you see something
that isn't right

210
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:46,025
don't touch it.

211
00:11:46,061 --> 00:11:47,325
Call for help.

212
00:11:47,364 --> 00:11:48,355
All right, let's go.

213
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,089
Ugh. What's this?

214
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,770
It's a biogenic compound.

215
00:12:40,813 --> 00:12:44,016
I wonder where it came from.

216
00:12:46,362 --> 00:12:47,855
Follow me.

217
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:08,319
These look like stasis tubes.

218
00:13:31,388 --> 00:13:32,790
Cardassian.

219
00:13:32,825 --> 00:13:34,489
He's been dead for about a year.

220
00:13:35,934 --> 00:13:37,427
Hey, look at this.

221
00:13:40,848 --> 00:13:42,044
Interesting.

222
00:13:42,084 --> 00:13:43,816
A regimental badge.

223
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,155
Third Battalion

224
00:13:45,193 --> 00:13:47,358
First Order,
if I'm not mistaken.

225
00:13:48,469 --> 00:13:50,873
This is going
to make Pechetti's day.

226
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:55,150
Both those tubes have
been activated recently.

227
00:13:57,293 --> 00:13:58,888
Coil spanner.

228
00:14:04,815 --> 00:14:06,479
Flux-coupler.

229
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:10,140
Uh-oh.

230
00:14:10,274 --> 00:14:11,767
Flux-coupler.

231
00:14:11,812 --> 00:14:13,214
I left it on the runabout.

232
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:14,879
I'll go get it right away, sir...

233
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,911
I mean, Chief.

234
00:14:20,169 --> 00:14:22,141
Garak to O'Brien.

235
00:14:22,174 --> 00:14:23,541
Go ahead.

236
00:14:23,578 --> 00:14:25,515
Could you come down
to the Infirmary?

237
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,316
There's something
you should see.

238
00:14:27,355 --> 00:14:29,019
On my way.

239
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:43,760
That's not right.

240
00:14:56,637 --> 00:14:58,130
A runabout doesn't disengage

241
00:14:58,175 --> 00:15:00,272
from its docking clamps
and blow up all on its own.

242
00:15:00,314 --> 00:15:01,442
Which leads me to believe

243
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,718
that the former occupants
of these chambers

244
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,724
are up and about.

245
00:15:04,827 --> 00:15:06,160
If you're telling me

246
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,827
that there are
two Cardassian soldiers

247
00:15:07,868 --> 00:15:09,999
from the Third Battalion
loose on this station

248
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,705
we're in trouble.

249
00:15:11,746 --> 00:15:13,239
"Death to all."

250
00:15:13,283 --> 00:15:14,411
That was their motto.

251
00:15:14,453 --> 00:15:16,083
Three simple words

252
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,894
and they certainly sum up
their credo nicely.

253
00:15:18,932 --> 00:15:21,063
Why would the Cardassians
abandon this station

254
00:15:21,105 --> 00:15:24,045
and leave behind a few soldiers
in stasis tubes?

255
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,071
Why do you think?

256
00:15:25,116 --> 00:15:26,609
To guard it.

257
00:15:26,654 --> 00:15:28,785
The tubes were probably rigged
to wake them up

258
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,263
as soon as someone
came aboard.

259
00:15:30,298 --> 00:15:33,705
Well, that's possible,
but one thing's for sure...

260
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:35,143
they're out there somewhere

261
00:15:35,178 --> 00:15:37,548
and considering
what they did to the runabout

262
00:15:37,585 --> 00:15:38,747
I don't think
they're too friendly.

263
00:15:38,788 --> 00:15:40,760
Maybe they're just upset

264
00:15:40,793 --> 00:15:42,627
because we haven't
introduced ourselves.

265
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:43,828
We should find them.

266
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:45,497
Say hello.

267
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,480
This thing's not working.

268
00:15:50,488 --> 00:15:51,718
Neither is mine.

269
00:15:51,757 --> 00:15:54,595
They must have set up
a dampening field.

270
00:15:54,632 --> 00:15:56,034
We've got to get out of here.

271
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,096
Let's call for help.

272
00:15:57,139 --> 00:15:58,769
How? The station's

273
00:15:58,811 --> 00:16:00,509
subspace transceiver
was ripped out

274
00:16:00,549 --> 00:16:02,042
when the Cardassians
evacuated.

275
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:04,652
Well, we could always
try sending smoke signals.

276
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:07,097
That's not a bad idea.

277
00:16:08,739 --> 00:16:12,340
The deflector grid
is still relatively intact.

278
00:16:12,382 --> 00:16:15,185
If we could modify
the field coils

279
00:16:15,223 --> 00:16:18,357
to emit a series
of covariant pulses...

280
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,561
We could use the station

281
00:16:19,602 --> 00:16:21,470
like an old-fashioned
telegraph

282
00:16:21,508 --> 00:16:22,841
and tap out an S.O.S.

283
00:16:22,878 --> 00:16:24,850
For the pulses
to be strong enough

284
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:26,183
to reach Deep Space 9

285
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,419
we'll have to boost power
to the induction grid.

286
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,594
Pechetti, you go down
to the Habitat Ring

287
00:16:31,636 --> 00:16:34,131
and bring
the microfusion reactor

288
00:16:34,176 --> 00:16:35,646
back on line.

289
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,548
Stolzoff, you go with him.

290
00:16:37,585 --> 00:16:41,722
Boq'ta, realign
the magnetic flow field

291
00:16:41,764 --> 00:16:43,632
in Conduit G-4.

292
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,606
Amaro will watch your back.

293
00:16:45,642 --> 00:16:48,582
Nog and Garak, you're with me.

294
00:16:48,616 --> 00:16:50,382
We'll set up
the signal generator

295
00:16:50,421 --> 00:16:51,617
in Cargo Bay 4.

296
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:53,289
Aye, Chief.

297
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,529
Use your communicators
as little as possible.

298
00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:57,301
We don't want to give away
our positions.

299
00:16:57,341 --> 00:16:58,743
Any questions?

300
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,114
Let's go.

301
00:17:08,706 --> 00:17:10,769
Well, I'm not convinced
Stolzoff was right

302
00:17:10,812 --> 00:17:12,407
about our Cardassian friends.

303
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,083
Why would anyone voluntarily

304
00:17:15,124 --> 00:17:17,119
seal themselves
into a stasis tube...

305
00:17:17,163 --> 00:17:18,462
perhaps for years...

306
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,597
just to guard
an abandoned station?

307
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,579
Even the Third Battalion
isn't that fanatical.

308
00:17:23,614 --> 00:17:26,144
Something else is going on.

309
00:17:26,188 --> 00:17:28,387
Maybe so, but I don't
intend to be here

310
00:17:28,428 --> 00:17:29,864
long enough to find
out what it is.

311
00:17:29,898 --> 00:17:31,562
That's the trouble with humans.

312
00:17:31,603 --> 00:17:33,506
You don't know how to appreciate
a good mystery.

313
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:35,410
I love a good mystery...

314
00:17:35,447 --> 00:17:36,940
the kind I can read in bed...

315
00:17:36,985 --> 00:17:39,321
not the kind that's
trying to kill you.

316
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,691
Don't get me wrong, Chief.

317
00:17:40,729 --> 00:17:42,324
I want to get off this station

318
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:44,201
as much as you do,
but I just know

319
00:17:44,238 --> 00:17:46,210
if I don't figure this out

320
00:17:46,244 --> 00:17:48,216
it's going to nag
at me for days.

321
00:17:48,249 --> 00:17:50,152
All right, now,
let's concentrate

322
00:17:50,189 --> 00:17:52,057
on finishing
the signal modulator

323
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,620
so that we can get out of here.

324
00:17:53,665 --> 00:17:56,765
You have the whole trip home
to sort out your mystery.

325
00:17:58,779 --> 00:17:59,873
Nog?

326
00:17:59,915 --> 00:18:02,012
I need your help
with the phase discriminator.

327
00:18:02,088 --> 00:18:03,820
On my way, Chief.

328
00:18:31,337 --> 00:18:33,775
Do you mind
not aiming that at me?

329
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,308
Don't worry, the safety's on.

330
00:18:49,187 --> 00:18:51,055
Tell me you did that.

331
00:19:32,173 --> 00:19:34,304
Maybe I did activate
the turbolift

332
00:19:34,346 --> 00:19:35,748
without realizing it.

333
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:40,462
I'm going up.

334
00:19:40,497 --> 00:19:42,092
Okay.

335
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,462
Whoa.

336
00:20:14,023 --> 00:20:15,584
Pechetti!

337
00:20:15,628 --> 00:20:17,223
Stolzoff to O'Brien!

338
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:18,235
A Cardass...

339
00:20:21,745 --> 00:20:24,115
Stolzoff?

340
00:20:24,152 --> 00:20:25,713
Stolzoff!

341
00:21:10,777 --> 00:21:13,512
The Cardassians
must've surprised them.

342
00:21:13,551 --> 00:21:15,351
They're probably using
the internal sensors

343
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,359
to track us.

344
00:21:16,392 --> 00:21:17,691
Take it easy.

345
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,667
We're going to get out of here,
you can count on that.

346
00:21:19,702 --> 00:21:21,639
But we've got to stay focused.

347
00:21:23,814 --> 00:21:25,877
Now, it looks like
Pechetti was almost done

348
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,084
getting the microfusion reactor
back on line.

349
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,097
I'll finish that

350
00:21:30,131 --> 00:21:31,965
and then I'll go back down
to the cargo bay.

351
00:21:32,003 --> 00:21:33,199
How are you doing
with the conduits?

352
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,303
I-I'm done.

353
00:21:35,345 --> 00:21:37,213
Good.
Now, you and Amaro

354
00:21:37,251 --> 00:21:38,915
get down to Auxiliary Control

355
00:21:38,956 --> 00:21:40,449
and reconfigure
the pulse generator.

356
00:21:40,494 --> 00:21:41,827
We're going to split up?

357
00:21:41,864 --> 00:21:42,833
We have to.

358
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:44,462
If we don't send out a signal

359
00:21:44,505 --> 00:21:47,035
we're never going
to get off this station.

360
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:48,048
But, Chief, what if we...

361
00:21:48,081 --> 00:21:49,574
I need you, Boq'ta.

362
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:50,849
You can do this.

363
00:21:50,956 --> 00:21:52,859
Don't worry.
I'll watch your back.

364
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,231
Stolzoff was supposed to be
watching Pechetti's back.

365
00:21:55,268 --> 00:21:56,635
Look what happened to them.

366
00:21:56,672 --> 00:21:58,165
What if I send Garak with you,
too?

367
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,976
Would that make you feel better?

368
00:22:01,518 --> 00:22:02,544
I'm flattered.

369
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:04,651
But I'm afraid
I have other plans.

370
00:22:04,694 --> 00:22:06,061
What are you talking about?

371
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:09,803
I don't intend to stand around
waiting to be killed.

372
00:22:09,842 --> 00:22:11,369
Meaning what?

373
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:14,513
Meaning I'm going after
those two Cardassian soldiers...

374
00:22:14,555 --> 00:22:16,321
and neutralize them.

375
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,832
Besides, all this whining

376
00:22:18,868 --> 00:22:20,235
is giving me a headache.

377
00:22:20,271 --> 00:22:22,870
You're going to have
more than a headache

378
00:22:22,945 --> 00:22:25,042
if you don't do
what the Chief wants.

379
00:22:25,085 --> 00:22:26,487
Amaro...

380
00:22:27,993 --> 00:22:31,332
You'd like to shoot me,
wouldn't you?

381
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:33,899
You're dying to kill
a Cardassian...

382
00:22:33,943 --> 00:22:35,538
any Cardassian.

383
00:22:35,581 --> 00:22:36,709
Let him go.

384
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,490
If he thinks he can
neutralize the Cardassians

385
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:43,502
let him try.

386
00:22:43,536 --> 00:22:45,804
He'll be doing us all a favor.

387
00:22:45,843 --> 00:22:47,507
That's the spirit.

388
00:22:47,547 --> 00:22:50,112
Why don't you come with me,
Chief?

389
00:22:50,155 --> 00:22:52,389
Kill a few "Cardies."

390
00:22:52,428 --> 00:22:54,331
It'll be like old times.

391
00:22:54,366 --> 00:22:56,429
Wouldn't you like
to avenge their deaths?

392
00:22:56,472 --> 00:22:58,238
No.

393
00:22:58,277 --> 00:23:00,807
I just want to get
everyone home.

394
00:23:00,851 --> 00:23:03,917
You're fighting your instincts,
I can see it

395
00:23:04,027 --> 00:23:08,095
but the hero of Setlik III is
still inside there somewhere.

396
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:13,142
If you're going to go, go.

397
00:23:19,671 --> 00:23:22,874
Nog, you go with Boq'ta
and Amaro.

398
00:23:22,913 --> 00:23:24,611
Aye, sir.

399
00:23:24,651 --> 00:23:26,121
It's all right, Chief.

400
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:28,219
He can stay with you.

401
00:23:28,261 --> 00:23:29,457
For some reason

402
00:23:29,498 --> 00:23:33,134
knowing Garak's going
after those Cardassians

403
00:23:33,175 --> 00:23:34,873
makes me feel better.

404
00:23:51,426 --> 00:23:54,161
"Access denied."
"Access denied."

405
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,668
Don't you know
how to say anything else?

406
00:23:59,883 --> 00:24:01,182
Apparently not.

407
00:24:05,733 --> 00:24:07,066
"Access denied."

408
00:24:09,076 --> 00:24:10,774
"Access denied."

409
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,322
"Access denied."

410
00:24:15,794 --> 00:24:19,931
"Access denied"...
how monotonous.

411
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:14,581
Looking for me?

412
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,600
Oh, that felt...

413
00:25:21,745 --> 00:25:23,078
good.

414
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:29,525
Chief, why does Garak
keep bringing up Setlik III?

415
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:32,200
Because he wants
to get under my skin.

416
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:34,338
But you were a hero,
weren't you?

417
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,508
That doesn't mean

418
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:38,217
I like thinking about
what happened then.

419
00:25:38,325 --> 00:25:40,159
I was a soldier, Nog.

420
00:25:40,196 --> 00:25:42,600
Sometimes soldiers have to kill.

421
00:25:42,637 --> 00:25:46,979
Come now, Chief,
don't be so modest.

422
00:25:47,016 --> 00:25:48,646
You did a lot of killing.

423
00:25:48,687 --> 00:25:50,248
How did you get in here?

424
00:25:50,325 --> 00:25:51,852
Both doors are secure.

425
00:25:51,895 --> 00:25:54,094
"Secure" is
such a relative term

426
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,867
wouldn't you agree?

427
00:25:55,907 --> 00:25:57,707
I've brought you something.

428
00:25:57,746 --> 00:26:00,150
If you don't mind.

429
00:26:01,523 --> 00:26:03,016
I'm sure Pechetti

430
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,963
would have appreciated it more,
but...

431
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:07,028
Where did you get this?

432
00:26:07,072 --> 00:26:08,474
From its former owner.

433
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:10,070
You killed one of the soldiers?

434
00:26:11,116 --> 00:26:13,247
One down, one to go.

435
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:16,023
By the way, I took a tissue
sample from the soldier's body.

436
00:26:16,064 --> 00:26:18,093
The analysis
was rather fascinating

437
00:26:18,136 --> 00:26:19,503
in a grim sort of way.

438
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,204
It seems the unfortunate soul

439
00:26:21,244 --> 00:26:24,241
had been given a massive dose
of psychotropic drugs.

440
00:26:24,287 --> 00:26:25,848
Why?

441
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,953
I'm not sure,
but I can tell you one thing...

442
00:26:27,996 --> 00:26:30,127
it wasn't to make him amicable.

443
00:26:30,169 --> 00:26:31,833
The drug's protein structure

444
00:26:31,874 --> 00:26:35,977
seems designed to amplify my
people's xenophobic tendencies.

445
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:38,993
My guess is that the soldiers
that were left here

446
00:26:39,027 --> 00:26:41,557
were part of a Cardassian
military experiment.

447
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:44,269
The High Command was probably
looking for a way

448
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:46,338
to further motivate
their troops.

449
00:26:46,448 --> 00:26:48,443
So they gave them a drug

450
00:26:48,487 --> 00:26:51,359
to make them hate
anybody but Cardassians.

451
00:26:51,462 --> 00:26:53,194
Then why did they attack you?

452
00:26:53,234 --> 00:26:54,670
That's a good question.

453
00:26:55,707 --> 00:26:57,975
Maybe it's an experiment
that went wrong.

454
00:26:58,014 --> 00:27:00,009
That's why they were left
in stasis.

455
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:01,352
They were uncontrollable.

456
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,885
I'd love to stay
and hypothesize all afternoon

457
00:27:03,931 --> 00:27:05,799
but once I've set my mind
to a task

458
00:27:05,836 --> 00:27:07,534
I hate to leave it unfinished.

459
00:27:10,983 --> 00:27:13,114
What is it, Chief?

460
00:27:13,156 --> 00:27:14,592
You look different.

461
00:27:14,627 --> 00:27:16,564
How so?

462
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,595
That's not the face of a tailor.

463
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:20,268
I'm not a tailor.

464
00:27:22,415 --> 00:27:24,410
Not for the moment, anyway.

465
00:27:30,906 --> 00:27:32,809
You know...

466
00:27:32,845 --> 00:27:35,317
I once bought a suit from Garak.

467
00:27:35,351 --> 00:27:38,622
Turns out the sleeve
was a little long.

468
00:27:38,661 --> 00:27:40,564
I remember being angry

469
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,540
when I brought it back
to be fixed.

470
00:27:43,574 --> 00:27:45,978
Is there a point to this story?

471
00:27:46,014 --> 00:27:47,951
If I'd known he was so dangerous

472
00:27:47,987 --> 00:27:49,480
I never would've complained.

473
00:27:51,596 --> 00:27:53,864
You think he'll get
the other Cardassian?

474
00:27:53,904 --> 00:27:55,271
I hope not.

475
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:57,609
I want to get him myself.

476
00:27:57,647 --> 00:27:58,707
I don't blame you.

477
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,881
Stolzoff was my friend.

478
00:28:00,923 --> 00:28:04,365
We were
at the Academy together.

479
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,137
She was my sparring partner.

480
00:28:08,176 --> 00:28:10,706
The first time we faced off

481
00:28:10,751 --> 00:28:12,278
I remember thinking
maybe I ought

482
00:28:12,322 --> 00:28:13,484
to take it easy on her.

483
00:28:14,962 --> 00:28:16,295
She ended up taking
me down so hard

484
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:17,826
it knocked
the wind out of me.

485
00:28:21,013 --> 00:28:24,979
That was the last time I ever
pulled a punch with her.

486
00:28:25,025 --> 00:28:27,624
She had this
one-two combination...

487
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:31,733
a feint to the right,
a back-handed chop to the neck...

488
00:28:31,777 --> 00:28:33,680
faked me out every time.

489
00:28:33,715 --> 00:28:35,778
If that spoon-head
gives me the chance

490
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:37,816
maybe I'll just
try that out on him.

491
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,834
I think Stolzoff
would've liked that.

492
00:28:44,445 --> 00:28:46,644
I can't get this loose.

493
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:49,419
Get me the coil spanner,
would you?

494
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,352
What does it look like?

495
00:29:01,393 --> 00:29:02,920
It's got two pointy things
on the end.

496
00:29:31,845 --> 00:29:34,283
He asked me to get
a coil spanner for him.

497
00:29:36,557 --> 00:29:38,688
I just turned my back
for a second.

498
00:29:43,143 --> 00:29:45,206
That's a shame.

499
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:49,123
And the worst part of it is...

500
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,793
this isn't a coil spanner.

501
00:29:54,607 --> 00:29:58,071
It's a flux-coupler.

502
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,591
That should do it.

503
00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:17,570
O'Brien to Boq'ta.

504
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:20,842
Boq'ta, come in.

505
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:24,823
Amaro, what's going on up there?

506
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:40,965
H-he's out there.

507
00:30:41,004 --> 00:30:42,166
Easy now, easy.

508
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:43,301
Who's out there?

509
00:30:43,344 --> 00:30:45,646
Garak!

510
00:30:45,684 --> 00:30:47,051
He stabbed me.

511
00:30:57,083 --> 00:31:00,286
Chief, why would Garak do this?

512
00:31:04,102 --> 00:31:05,538
Come on.

513
00:31:07,511 --> 00:31:09,540
He may still be close by.

514
00:31:31,813 --> 00:31:34,217
It doesn't make any sense.

515
00:31:34,253 --> 00:31:36,121
Garak's on our side.

516
00:31:36,158 --> 00:31:38,153
Not anymore.

517
00:31:44,147 --> 00:31:47,384
The psychotropic drug.

518
00:31:47,423 --> 00:31:50,397
He must have been exposed to it.

519
00:31:50,432 --> 00:31:53,304
It's the only explanation.

520
00:31:53,373 --> 00:31:55,139
I should've seen it earlier.

521
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:59,488
The way he accused Amaro
of wanting to kill him.

522
00:31:59,524 --> 00:32:02,464
The way he insisted on going
after those Cardassians.

523
00:32:03,969 --> 00:32:05,964
He's coming after us, isn't he?

524
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,780
Yes.

525
00:32:09,818 --> 00:32:12,120
Maybe we can reason with him.

526
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,962
Get him to try to understand
that the drug is affecting him.

527
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,302
You saw what he did
to Amaro and the others.

528
00:32:17,407 --> 00:32:18,968
He's not going to listen to us.

529
00:32:19,011 --> 00:32:22,509
Then, we have to finish
setting up the deflector grid.

530
00:32:22,554 --> 00:32:24,184
We've got to get
a distress signal out.

531
00:32:24,225 --> 00:32:26,059
Garak knows
what we're trying to do.

532
00:32:26,098 --> 00:32:27,328
He'll stop us.

533
00:32:27,435 --> 00:32:29,338
Don't we have to try?

534
00:32:29,374 --> 00:32:31,573
Forget it!

535
00:32:31,614 --> 00:32:33,244
I've already lost four crewmen

536
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,188
trying to send out
that bloody signal.

537
00:32:36,995 --> 00:32:38,488
Garak was right.

538
00:32:38,532 --> 00:32:40,731
We should have gone
after those Cardassians

539
00:32:40,772 --> 00:32:42,937
as soon as they attacked us.

540
00:32:42,978 --> 00:32:45,781
You don't wait
for the enemy to come to you.

541
00:32:45,819 --> 00:32:47,015
You go to him.

542
00:32:48,761 --> 00:32:50,254
Come on.

543
00:32:50,298 --> 00:32:53,796
We're going after Garak.

544
00:32:53,842 --> 00:32:56,280
Y-you mean, to kill him?

545
00:32:56,315 --> 00:32:59,779
If that's what it takes
to stop him, yes.

546
00:33:18,411 --> 00:33:21,408
I know you're hiding
somewhere...

547
00:33:22,923 --> 00:33:26,330
Ah. There you are.

548
00:33:30,845 --> 00:33:33,546
Garak to Chief O'Brien.

549
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:38,694
You'll never guess
what I just found.

550
00:33:38,734 --> 00:33:40,729
A kotra board.

551
00:33:40,773 --> 00:33:42,471
The Station Commander
left one in his office.

552
00:33:42,511 --> 00:33:45,485
The pieces
were scattered all over

553
00:33:45,553 --> 00:33:49,496
but I found the last one
hiding under his desk.

554
00:33:49,531 --> 00:33:50,761
I can't help thinking

555
00:33:50,801 --> 00:33:52,898
what a perfect metaphor
this game is

556
00:33:52,941 --> 00:33:54,844
for our present situation, hmm?

557
00:33:54,879 --> 00:33:58,686
Two players, two minds,
two strategies

558
00:33:58,723 --> 00:34:01,390
each trying
to outmaneuver the other...

559
00:34:01,431 --> 00:34:04,998
testing the enemy's defenses,
advancing, retreating.

560
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,009
We split up.

561
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:07,239
Enter Ops
through the main corridor.

562
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,476
I'll go through
the Captain's office.

563
00:34:08,551 --> 00:34:09,485
Wait for my signal.

564
00:34:09,554 --> 00:34:10,921
...that, in the game
we're playing

565
00:34:10,957 --> 00:34:12,986
the stakes are life and death

566
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:15,560
which makes it
so much more interesting.

567
00:34:16,706 --> 00:34:20,113
I haven't had this much fun
in years.

568
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,483
My heart's pounding.

569
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,517
The blood's racing
through my veins.

570
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:26,659
I feel so alive...

571
00:34:26,701 --> 00:34:30,371
and I'd wager, so do you.

572
00:35:21,547 --> 00:35:24,453
It looks like I've captured
your last piece, Chief.

573
00:35:24,488 --> 00:35:26,322
If you want it back

574
00:35:26,361 --> 00:35:28,629
you're going to have
to take it from me.

575
00:35:57,615 --> 00:35:59,313
It's your move, Chief.

576
00:35:59,353 --> 00:36:00,583
What are you going to do?

577
00:36:00,623 --> 00:36:03,153
Attack? Retreat? Surrender?

578
00:36:03,197 --> 00:36:04,724
Listen to me, Garak,
it's the drug.

579
00:36:04,768 --> 00:36:06,032
It's affecting you.

580
00:36:06,105 --> 00:36:07,700
You've got to fight it.

581
00:36:07,743 --> 00:36:08,712
Fight it?

582
00:36:09,749 --> 00:36:11,013
But I'm enjoying myself.

583
00:36:11,052 --> 00:36:13,890
This is the most exciting
game I've played in years.

584
00:36:13,927 --> 00:36:15,055
It's not a game!

585
00:36:15,096 --> 00:36:16,828
Oh, but it is,
and the best thing about it

586
00:36:16,868 --> 00:36:18,897
is that it brings out
the player's true nature.

587
00:36:18,941 --> 00:36:19,910
Where are you, Garak?!

588
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:21,072
I saw the look in your eyes

589
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,652
when I took the Ferengi
away from you.

590
00:36:23,688 --> 00:36:25,090
You wanted to kill me.

591
00:36:25,191 --> 00:36:27,790
You wanted to strangle me
with your bare hands.

592
00:36:27,832 --> 00:36:30,966
I just want my crewman back,
that's all.

593
00:36:31,008 --> 00:36:32,638
You're a killer, admit it.

594
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:34,046
We both are.

595
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:37,114
Behind your Federation mask
of decency and benevolence

596
00:36:37,158 --> 00:36:38,252
you're a predator

597
00:36:38,295 --> 00:36:39,457
just like me.

598
00:36:39,498 --> 00:36:42,667
No, I'm nothing like you.

599
00:36:42,707 --> 00:36:43,903
Oh, but you are.

600
00:36:43,944 --> 00:36:45,505
You proved that on Setlik III.

601
00:36:45,548 --> 00:36:46,984
How many Cardassians
did you kill?

602
00:36:47,019 --> 00:36:47,988
Ten? 20? 100?

603
00:36:48,022 --> 00:36:49,686
I don't remember.

604
00:36:49,726 --> 00:36:51,857
Oh, but you remember
how you felt.

605
00:36:51,899 --> 00:36:53,494
The Cardassians
were killing your men.

606
00:36:53,537 --> 00:36:54,528
You had to stop them.

607
00:36:54,573 --> 00:36:55,735
You had to make them pay.

608
00:36:55,777 --> 00:36:57,749
Blood for blood!

609
00:36:57,783 --> 00:37:01,281
You enjoyed killing them,
didn't you, huh?

610
00:37:01,326 --> 00:37:06,136
You enjoyed watching the life
drain out of their eyes.

611
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:08,302
All right, Garak,
you want to finish this game?

612
00:37:08,346 --> 00:37:10,283
Fine, let's finish it.

613
00:37:10,317 --> 00:37:11,912
You and me, face to face.

614
00:37:11,955 --> 00:37:15,158
Nothing would give me
greater pleasure.

615
00:37:15,198 --> 00:37:17,432
We'll meet on the Promenade.

616
00:37:17,471 --> 00:37:18,838
No weapons!

617
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:21,906
No weapons.

618
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:27,090
You have no idea how hard it is

619
00:37:27,132 --> 00:37:30,973
to keep from pulling
this trigger

620
00:37:31,009 --> 00:37:33,744
but I need you alive.

621
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,585
They've come to cheer you on,
Chief...

622
00:39:00,626 --> 00:39:02,062
your loyal team.

623
00:39:02,096 --> 00:39:05,834
Apparently, they've forgiven you
for getting them all killed.

624
00:39:05,874 --> 00:39:09,281
My supporters
may be fewer in number

625
00:39:09,317 --> 00:39:10,547
but they're no less loyal.

626
00:39:14,497 --> 00:39:17,836
I thought we agreed,
no weapons.

627
00:39:19,813 --> 00:39:21,477
What's that in your hand?

628
00:39:21,517 --> 00:39:24,389
Well, how did this get here?

629
00:39:25,562 --> 00:39:28,263
But we won't be
needing these, will we?

630
00:39:28,303 --> 00:39:30,400
Put yours down.

631
00:39:30,476 --> 00:39:31,912
You first.

632
00:39:31,947 --> 00:39:33,611
Put it down...

633
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:35,782
or say good-bye to the Ferengi.

634
00:39:35,824 --> 00:39:37,419
Don't do it, Chief.

635
00:39:37,529 --> 00:39:39,261
Oh, he has nothing
to worry about.

636
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,602
I'm not going to shoot
an unarmed man.

637
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,110
What fun would that be?

638
00:39:50,933 --> 00:39:53,873
You wouldn't happen to have
another one, would you?

639
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:01,658
Naughty, naughty.

640
00:40:12,393 --> 00:40:14,023
Your turn.

641
00:40:14,065 --> 00:40:17,529
I admit I am tempted

642
00:40:17,641 --> 00:40:19,977
to end this right now.

643
00:40:20,014 --> 00:40:24,926
But that would be depriving
myself of too much enjoyment.

644
00:40:49,496 --> 00:40:50,726
I'm disappointed, Chief.

645
00:40:50,766 --> 00:40:53,000
I expected to see the bloodlust
in your eyes

646
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,236
but all I see is fear.

647
00:41:09,151 --> 00:41:11,419
Maybe it's true.

648
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:14,296
Maybe you're not
a soldier anymore.

649
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:15,735
You're right.

650
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:17,707
I'm an engineer.

651
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:32,474
You okay, Nog?

652
00:41:32,516 --> 00:41:35,319
I'm all right, sir.

653
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,152
Is he dead?

654
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,956
Did you kill him?

655
00:42:04,994 --> 00:42:06,828
No...

656
00:42:06,866 --> 00:42:09,168
I didn't.

657
00:42:17,764 --> 00:42:20,032
He should be all right
in a few days.

658
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,703
I've neutralized
the psychotropic compound

659
00:42:22,744 --> 00:42:25,114
that was affecting
his nervous system.

660
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,852
He looks so peaceful.

661
00:42:27,892 --> 00:42:29,259
It's hard to believe

662
00:42:29,295 --> 00:42:32,634
he's the same man
who attacked us.

663
00:42:32,672 --> 00:42:35,612
In a way, he's not.

664
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:38,314
The drug brought out
the worst parts of him

665
00:42:38,354 --> 00:42:40,349
and allowed them to take over.

666
00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:43,094
He wasn't in control
of his actions.

667
00:42:45,106 --> 00:42:46,576
Can I talk to him?

668
00:42:46,611 --> 00:42:48,411
For a minute.

669
00:43:07,302 --> 00:43:09,467
I thought you might like to know

670
00:43:09,508 --> 00:43:11,946
that we salvaged
the plasma manifold.

671
00:43:11,981 --> 00:43:14,112
It's being installed right now.

672
00:43:14,154 --> 00:43:16,855
Mission accomplished.

673
00:43:18,098 --> 00:43:22,098
I guess it didn't exactly go
the way any of us expected.

674
00:43:24,684 --> 00:43:27,624
You know there's going
to be an inquest.

675
00:43:27,658 --> 00:43:29,630
Yes. I've been told that.

676
00:43:29,664 --> 00:43:34,234
Chief, I was hoping
to ask a favor.

677
00:43:34,277 --> 00:43:36,545
Don't worry,
once they know the facts...

678
00:43:36,616 --> 00:43:38,086
It's not about that.

679
00:43:39,726 --> 00:43:43,533
I'd like you to express my...

680
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:46,943
deepest regrets to Amaro's wife.

681
00:43:46,979 --> 00:43:48,312
I'd talk to her myself

682
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:50,983
but I'm not sure
she'd welcome that.

683
00:43:51,024 --> 00:43:52,585
I'll tell her.

684
00:43:52,661 --> 00:43:54,690
I'd appreciate it.

685
00:43:54,734 --> 00:43:58,073
Julian tells me the blast
broke a couple of your ribs.

686
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:59,580
Well, it could have been worse.

687
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,746
If I'd been any closer
to that phaser

688
00:44:01,788 --> 00:44:03,224
it would have killed me.

689
00:44:03,258 --> 00:44:06,996
Don't take this the wrong way,
but... that was the plan.

690
00:44:07,035 --> 00:44:09,405
I understand.

691
00:44:12,451 --> 00:44:13,442
See you around.
