1
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:11,386
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

2
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,681
It's a little
quiet in here.

3
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:15,641
Oh, you just
beat the rush.

4
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:18,686
Uh, let me get your order
before, uh...

5
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:20,312
before I get swamped.

6
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,314
DAX:
I'll have
a Til'amin froth.

7
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:23,816
I'll have a...

8
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:25,400
(<i> loud drilling noise</i> )

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,986
What was that?

10
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:28,529
What was what?!

11
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,656
Oh,<i> that!</i>
That's, uh...

12
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,073
(<i> noise stops</i> )

13
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,492
just my nephew
and Chief O'Brien

14
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,076
repairing
some conduit.

15
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,370
You'll get
used to it.

16
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,497
(<i> noise resumes</i> )

17
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,248
The Klingon
restaurant.

18
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:41,959
It would be quieter.

19
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,721
When are you two going
to be done in there?

20
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,514
When the conduit
is repaired

21
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,516
and brought back up
to safety specs.

22
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,852
Well, hurry up before I
lose all my customers.

23
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:03,022
I need to get something.
What?

24
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:04,815
Two root beers.

25
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:08,986
(<i> noise resumes</i> )

26
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:10,779
Aah...

27
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,367
Hyperspanner.

28
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,000
Optronic coupler.

29
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:36,638
How did you know
I was going to ask
for a phase decompiler?

30
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,432
I was paying
attention, sir.

31
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,059
That you were, Cadet.

32
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:42,143
My father says I can
learn a lot from you.

33
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,271
He says you can
fix<i> anything.</i>

34
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,147
I'm an engineer.

35
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,942
That's what we do.

36
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:49,526
There.

37
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,613
Good as new.

38
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:53,948
Amazing.

39
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:55,657
(<i> yelling, coughing</i> )

40
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,242
O'BRIEN:
Damn!

41
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,994
We repaired
the leak right away,

42
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:00,913
but the problem was
worse than I thought.

43
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:03,082
The entire plasma distribution
manifold is shot.

44
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:04,541
Can you replicate
a new one?

45
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,961
No. Cardassian manifolds

46
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,754
use a beta-matrix compositor

47
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,380
which can't be replicated.

48
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,549
Well, I suppose we could
contact Gul Dukat

49
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:16,136
and ask him if he has
any spare manifold
systems lying around.

50
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,222
I'm sure he'd jump
at the chance to help us.

51
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,766
Any other ideas?

52
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,726
We could send
a salvage team

53
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:25,395
to the abandoned
Cardassian station
in the Trivas system.

54
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,231
Empok Nor.
It's the same design
as this station.

55
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,525
The Cardassians pulled out
about a year ago,

56
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,779
but there's good chance that
the plasma manifold system
is still operational.

57
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:36,115
What about Dominion activity
in the area?

58
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:38,199
There hasn't been any
for several months.

59
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,244
Strategically, they seem
to have lost interest
in that sector.

60
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,246
But there is
one problem.

61
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,916
It's standard
Cardassian procedure

62
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,209
to booby-trap a facility
before abandoning it,

63
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,712
and a lot of the surprises
they leave behind

64
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:54,091
are specifically keyed
to attack non-Cardassians.

65
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:57,176
Sounds like you should
take a Cardassian along.

66
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,972
O'BRIEN:
So, what did Captain Sisko do
to persuade you to come along?

67
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:01,932
How do you know
I didn't volunteer?

68
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,558
(<i> laughs</i> )
He threatened you,
didn't he?

69
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,769
Nothing so coarse.
The Captain bribed me.

70
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,647
He offered to help me
procure a larger space
for my workshop.

71
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:11,650
The latest dressmaking equipment
is surprisingly bulky.

72
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,902
Well, whatever he did,
I'm glad you're here.

73
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,613
What's the matter?

74
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,115
Well, it's just that lately

75
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,701
I've noticed everyone
seems to trust me.

76
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,662
It's quite unnerving.
I'm still trying
to get used to it.

77
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:26,790
Next thing I know, people
are going to be inviting me
to their homes for dinner.

78
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,542
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

79
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,752
I promise I will
<i>never</i> have you over.

80
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,463
I appreciate that, Chief.
Ah, don't mention it.

81
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,382
Anything to return the favor.

82
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,967
Disarming
Cardassian booby traps

83
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,886
is my least favorite
kind of engineering.

84
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,846
GARAK:
I can certainly
understand that,

85
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:44,141
but don't worry.
I have some experience
in that area.

86
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,809
Booby traps?

87
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,352
I can't believe
I let you talk me

88
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,188
into volunteering
for this.

89
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:51,773
Well, it beats
working on the waste
extraction system.

90
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,985
Besides, how often
does an engineer
get to wear a phaser?

91
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,904
Hate to disappoint
you, Pechetti,

92
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,198
but the only thing you're
going to be using that for

93
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:00,699
is shooting voles.

94
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,450
Empok Nor's been
abandoned so long

95
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,785
they're going to be hungry.

96
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,621
Don't worry.

97
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,998
You play with your wrenches.

98
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,541
We'll watch your backs.

99
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,760
Can I help you, Cadet?

100
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,720
I'm reporting for duty...

101
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,804
sir.

102
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,432
Welcome aboard, Cadet.

103
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,184
Thank you, sir.
And may I say,

104
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,894
it's a privilege
to be here, sir.

105
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,854
You've earned it.

106
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,148
But one more "sir,"
and I'll leave you behind.

107
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,483
Very well, s... Chief.

108
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,112
Let's get going.

109
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:39,654
Next stop: Empok Nor.

110
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,323
(<i> dice clattering</i>
<i>on board</i> )

111
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,118
GARAK:
What are you doing?

112
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,452
NOG:
Regrouping.

113
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,080
But you're losing.

114
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,207
That's why I need
to protect my assets.

115
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,167
This is<i> not</i>
a financial transaction.

116
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,753
Protecting your assets
is what got you into trouble

117
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,756
in the first place.
You have to go on the offensive.

118
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,341
You have to attack.

119
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,219
Your move.
Oh, this is maddening.

120
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:10,305
Asking a Ferengi
to play a Cardassian game

121
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:14,642
is like asking a Klingon to
chew with his mouth closed.

122
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:18,063
Kotra is not about "regrouping"
or hoarding "assets."

123
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,814
It's about bold strategy

124
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,608
and decisive action.

125
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,361
Chief, would you like
to take on the winner?

126
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:28,240
I'd love to play kotra against
the hero of Setlik III.

127
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,950
What is that supposed to mean?

128
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,327
Oh, we all know your
distinguished war record--

129
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:35,622
how you led two dozen men
against the Barrica encampment

130
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,917
and took out an entire
regiment of Cardassians.

131
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,628
If you play kotra
with half that brazenness,

132
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,422
we'd have quite a match.

133
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:46,300
I'm not a soldier anymore.
I'm an engineer.

134
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,719
I see.
So when you and Dr. Bashir
go into the holosuites

135
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,056
for hours at a time,
you're just repairing them?

136
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,891
What's your point, Garak?

137
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,311
I'm just curious.
Why<i> do</i> you and Dr. Bashir

138
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,980
spend hours in the holosuites,
dressed as fighter pilots,

139
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,982
reliving ancient battles?

140
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,067
We... do it for fun.

141
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,986
It's a game.

142
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,904
And so is kotra.

143
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,617
And I'd love nothing more

144
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,203
than to play
against a man like you.

145
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,289
Maybe some other time.

146
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:24,087
Chief, here's the
wish list you wanted.

147
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,048
Three categories.
"Must-have"-- which
includes the manifolds

148
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,009
and plasma recoilers.

149
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,678
"Could-use"-- things like,
uh, EPS matrix converters.

150
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,347
And "would-be-nice"--

151
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,931
bypass displacers,
polarity maximizers,

152
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,641
that sort of thing.

153
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,436
Cardassian emblems
and insignias?

154
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:43,357
Well, a low priority,
but if we happen to find some--

155
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:45,359
This is a salvage operation,
Pechetti,

156
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:48,736
not an opportunity to indulge
your collecting obsession.

157
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,155
Right.

158
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,795
Approaching Empok Nor, sir.

159
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,130
Take us
out of warp.

160
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,924
Run a full scan.

161
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,634
I'll take the helm.

162
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,428
NOG:
The station's
main power supply

163
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,596
and life-support systems
are off-line.

164
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,516
No life signs.

165
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,142
I'll take us
into transporter range.

166
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,102
Oh, I don't think we can
risk beaming aboard.

167
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:24,231
There are probably pattern
scramblers rigged to go off

168
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:27,442
if they detect
a non-Cardassian
transporter signal.

169
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:30,737
That could be messy.
We'll have to dock.

170
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,198
Landing pads are sealed.

171
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,949
We'll have to try
an upper pylon.

172
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,701
Won't the airlock
have booby traps?

173
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,120
You can count on it.
And someone

174
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,248
is going to have
to disarm them
before we dock.

175
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,707
I volunteer, sir.

176
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,459
The scanner
in the airlock

177
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,044
might mistake
your enthusiasm

178
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,838
as Cardassian...
but not your DNA.

179
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,924
No, I'm afraid
I'm the only one

180
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,509
who has a chance
of getting through.

181
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,358
(<i> air hissing, thumping</i> )

182
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,239
(<i> thumping footsteps</i> )

183
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,118
(<i> mechanism clicking</i> )

184
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,463
(<i> clattering</i> )

185
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,508
(<i> keypad beeping</i> )

186
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,302
(<i> equipment</i>
<i>powering up</i> )

187
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,812
(<i> static</i> )

188
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,779
(<i> equipment</i>
<i>beeping softly</i> )

189
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,174
(<i> footsteps</i> )

190
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,345
Ah, welcome to Empok Nor.

191
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,846
Thanks for having us.

192
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,222
Take whatever you need.

193
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,642
My house
is your house.

194
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,768
All right, listen up.

195
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,104
We're going to break up
into three teams.

196
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,023
Nog and Stolzoff,
you're with me.

197
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,608
We'll do the "must-haves."

198
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,901
Pechetti and Amaro,
you'll do the "could-use."

199
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,821
Boq'ta and Garak--
"would-be-nice."

200
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,115
Garak has disabled
the central security net,

201
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,117
but there could be
booby traps anywhere.

202
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,828
Don't move into an area
until you've scanned it.

203
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,998
If you see something
that isn't right,
don't touch it.

204
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,417
Call for help.
All right, let's go.

205
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:35,129
Ugh. What's this?

206
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:43,137
It's a biogenic
compound.

207
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,014
I wonder
where it came from.

208
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,809
Follow me.

209
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,080
These look
like stasis tubes.

210
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,468
(<i> grunting</i> )

211
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,605
Cardassian.

212
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,356
He's been dead
for about a year.

213
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,318
Hey, look at this.

214
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,658
Interesting.
A regimental badge.

215
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:48,202
Third Battalion, First Order,
if I'm not mistaken.

216
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,623
This is going
to make Pechetti's day.

217
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:56,002
Both those tubes have
been activated recently.

218
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,756
Coil spanner.

219
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,305
Flux-coupler.

220
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:12,018
Uh-oh.
Flux-coupler.

221
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,687
I left it on the runabout.

222
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,313
I'll go get it
right away, sir--

223
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,939
I mean, Chief.

224
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,402
(<i> weary exhalation</i> )

225
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,489
Garak to O'Brien.
Go ahead.

226
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,491
Could you come down
to the Infirmary?

227
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,326
There's something
you should see.

228
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,994
On my way.

229
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,801
That's not right.

230
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:47,762
(<i> gasps</i> )

231
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,940
A runabout
doesn't disengage

232
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,193
from its docking
clamps and blow up
all on its own.

233
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,612
Which leads me to believe
that the former occupants
of these chambers

234
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,614
are up and about.

235
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,325
If you're telling me
that there are two
Cardassian soldiers

236
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:13,329
from the Third Battalion
loose on this station,
we're in trouble.

237
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,082
"Death to all."
That was
their motto.

238
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:20,503
Three simple words,
and they certainly sum up
their credo nicely.

239
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,839
Why would the Cardassians
abandon this station

240
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,466
and leave behind a few soldiers
in stasis tubes?

241
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,219
Why do you think?
To guard it.

242
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,054
The tubes were probably
rigged to wake them up

243
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,765
as soon as someone
came aboard.

244
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:35,059
Well, that's possible,
but one thing's for sure--

245
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,936
they're out there somewhere

246
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,730
and considering what
they did to the runabout

247
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,690
I don't think
they're too friendly.

248
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,233
Maybe they're just upset

249
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,984
because we haven't
introduced ourselves.

250
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,780
We should find them.
Say hello.

251
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,199
This thing's not working.

252
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,036
Neither is mine.

253
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,747
They must have set up
a dampening field.

254
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:58,374
We've got to
get out of here.
Let's call for help.

255
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,669
How? The station's
subspace transceiver
was ripped out

256
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,546
when the Cardassians
evacuated.

257
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:06,215
Well, we could always
try sending smoke signals.

258
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,593
That's not a bad idea.

259
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:14,307
The deflector grid
is still relatively intact.

260
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,684
If we could modify
the field coils

261
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,938
to emit a series
of covariant pulses--

262
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:22,649
We could use the station
like an old-fashioned
telegraph

263
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,317
and tap out an S.O.S.

264
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,319
O'BRIEN:
For the pulses to
be strong enough

265
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,613
to reach Deep Space 9
we'll have to boost power

266
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,615
to the induction grid.

267
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,827
Pechetti, you go down
to the Habitat Ring

268
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:37,163
and bring
the microfusion reactor
back on line.

269
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,248
Stolzoff, you go with him.

270
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:45,171
Boq'ta, realign
the magnetic flow field
in Conduit G-4.

271
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,381
Amaro will watch your back.

272
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,884
Nog and Garak, you're with me.

273
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:53,053
We'll set up the
signal generator
in Cargo Bay 4.

274
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,764
NOG:
Aye, Chief.

275
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,808
Use your communicators
as little as possible.

276
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,685
We don't want to give away
our positions.

277
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,353
Any questions?

278
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:04,732
Let's go.

279
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,281
Well, I'm not convinced
Stolzoff was right

280
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,992
about our Cardassian friends.

281
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,410
Why would anyone
voluntarily

282
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,454
seal themselves
into a stasis tube--

283
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,956
perhaps for years--

284
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,166
just to guard an
abandoned station?

285
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,252
Even the Third Battalion
isn't that fanatical.

286
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,380
Something else
is going on.

287
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,757
O'BRIEN:
Maybe so, but I don't
intend to be here

288
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,300
long enough to find
out what it is.

289
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,011
GARAK: That's the trouble
with humans.

290
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:35,013
You don't know how to
appreciate a good mystery.

291
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,764
O'BRIEN:
I love a good mystery...

292
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,683
the kind I can
read in bed--

293
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,518
not the kind that's
trying to kill you.

294
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,061
GARAK:
Don't get me
wrong, Chief.

295
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,563
I want to get
off this station

296
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,481
as much as you do,
but I just know

297
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,525
if I don't
figure this out,

298
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,527
it's going to nag
at me for days.

299
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,779
O'BRIEN: All right, now,
let's concentrate

300
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,489
on finishing the
signal modulator

301
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,366
so that we can
get out of here.

302
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:58,202
You have the whole trip home
to sort out your mystery.

303
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,416
Nog? I need your help
with the phase
discriminator.

304
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,084
On my way, Chief.

305
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,346
(<i> tool whirring</i> )

306
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,239
Do you mind not
aiming that at me?

307
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:38,659
Don't worry,
the safety's on.

308
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:42,663
(<i> sighing</i> )

309
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,465
Tell me you did that.

310
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,178
(<i> turbolift whirring</i> )

311
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,813
(<i> turbolift stopping</i> )

312
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,231
(<i> no audio</i> )

313
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,693
(<i> turbolift opens</i> )

314
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,382
Maybe I did activate
the turbolift

315
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,135
without realizing it.

316
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,722
I'm going up.

317
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,516
Okay.

318
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,707
Whoa.

319
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,628
(<i> yelling</i> )

320
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,799
Pechetti!

321
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,468
Stolzoff to O'Brien!
A Cardass--

322
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,387
(<i> grunting</i> )

323
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,847
(<i> scream, thud</i> )

324
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,183
Stolzoff?

325
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:26,559
Stolzoff!

326
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,830
(<i> sighing</i> )

327
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,590
(<i> glass crunching</i>
<i>underfoot</i> )

328
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,983
BOQ'TA:
The Cardassians
must've surprised them.

329
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,903
They're probably using
the internal sensors
to track us.

330
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,614
Take it easy. We're going
to get out of here,
you can count on that.

331
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,616
But we've got to stay focused.

332
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,578
It looks like
Pechetti was almost done

333
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:30,081
getting the microfusion reactor
back on line.

334
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:33,709
I'll finish that
and then I'll go back down
to the cargo bay.

335
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,335
How are you doing
with the conduits?

336
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,379
I-I'm done.

337
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,381
Good.
Now, you and Amaro

338
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,050
get down
to Auxiliary Control

339
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,593
and reconfigure
the pulse generator.

340
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,971
We're going to split up?
We have to.

341
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,722
If we don't
send out a signal,

342
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,808
we're never going
to get off this station.

343
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,602
But, Chief, what if we--
I need you, Boq'ta.

344
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:52,895
You can do this.

345
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,939
Don't worry.
I'll watch your back.

346
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:57,399
Stolzoff was supposed to be
watching Pechetti's back.

347
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,776
Look what happened to them.

348
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,945
What if I send
Garak with you, too?

349
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:03,447
Would that make
you feel better?

350
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,784
I'm flattered. But I'm afraid
I have other plans.

351
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,119
What are you talking about?

352
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,079
I don't intend to stand around

353
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,457
waiting to be killed.
Meaning what?

354
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,502
Meaning I'm going after
those two Cardassian soldiers...

355
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,462
and neutralize them.

356
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:23,050
Besides, all this whining
is giving me a headache.

357
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,927
AMARO:
You're going to have more
than a headache

358
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,180
if you don't do
what the Chief wants.

359
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,639
Amaro...

360
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:33,269
You'd like to shoot me,
wouldn't you?

361
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:37,648
You're dying
to kill a Cardassian--
any Cardassian.

362
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:38,858
Let him go.

363
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:45,781
If he thinks he can
neutralize the Cardassians,
let him try.

364
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,825
He'll be doing us all
a favor.

365
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:49,994
That's the spirit.

366
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:52,454
Why don't you come
with me, Chief?

367
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,290
Kill a few "Cardies."

368
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,125
It'll be like old times.

369
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,502
Wouldn't you like
to avenge their deaths?

370
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,629
No.

371
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,798
I just want to get
everyone home.

372
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,968
You're fighting your
instincts, I can see it,

373
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:10,223
but the hero of Setlik III is
still inside there somewhere.

374
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:15,228
If you're going to go, go.

375
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,862
Nog, you go with Boq'ta
and Amaro.

376
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:26,488
Aye, sir.

377
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,157
It's all right, Chief.

378
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:30,868
He can stay with you.

379
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:35,164
For some reason,
knowing Garak's going
after those Cardassians

380
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:36,957
makes me feel better.

381
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:53,599
(<i> terminal beeping</i> )

382
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,810
"Access denied."
"Access denied."

383
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,980
Don't you know
how to say anything else?

384
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,775
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Apparently not.

385
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,651
(<i> distant</i>
<i>mechanical thump</i> )

386
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,031
(<i> terminal beeping</i> )
"Access denied."

387
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,410
"Access denied."

388
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,829
"Access denied."

389
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:21,794
"Access denied"--
how monotonous.

390
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:16,890
Looking for me?

391
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,351
(<i> yells</i> )

392
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,561
Oh, that felt...

393
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:24,898
good.

394
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:32,072
Chief, why does Garak
keep bringing up Setlik III?

395
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,367
Because he wants
to get under my skin.

396
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:36,618
But you were a hero,
weren't you?

397
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:40,206
That doesn't mean
I like thinking about
what happened then.

398
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:42,249
I was a soldier, Nog.

399
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,502
Sometimes soldiers
have to kill.

400
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:48,714
GARAK:
Come now, Chief,
don't be so modest.

401
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:51,008
You did a lot
of killing.

402
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,969
How did you get in here?
Both doors are secure.

403
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,888
"Secure" is
such a relative term,

404
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,639
wouldn't you agree?

405
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,641
I've brought you something.

406
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,935
If you don't mind.

407
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,562
I'm sure Pechetti

408
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,732
would've appreciated it
more, but...

409
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,734
Where did you get this?

410
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,194
From its former owner.

411
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:11,778
You killed one of the soldiers?

412
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,948
One down, one to go.

413
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,617
By the way, I took a tissue
sample from the soldier's body.

414
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,786
The analysis
was rather fascinating,

415
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,288
in a grim sort of way.

416
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,207
It seems the unfortunate soul

417
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:25,792
had been given a massive dose
of psychotropic drugs.

418
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,254
Why?
I'm not sure,

419
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:31,757
but I can tell you one thing--
it wasn't to make him amicable.

420
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,759
The drug's protein structure

421
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:37,555
seems designed to amplify my
people's xenophobic tendencies.

422
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:40,391
My guess is that the soldiers
that were left here

423
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:42,935
were part of a Cardassian
military experiment.

424
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,979
The High Command was probably
looking for a way

425
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,107
to further motivate
their troops.

426
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,109
So they gave them a drug

427
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:53,028
to make them hate
anybody but Cardassians.

428
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,780
Then why did they attack<i> you?</i>

429
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,116
That's a good question.

430
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,452
Maybe it's an experiment
that went wrong.

431
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:01,495
That's why they were left
in stasis.

432
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:03,205
They were
uncontrollable.

433
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:05,665
I'd love to stay
and hypothesize all afternoon,

434
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,585
but once I've set my mind
to a task,

435
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:09,711
I hate to leave it unfinished.

436
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,758
What is it, Chief?

437
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,510
You look different.

438
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,304
How so?

439
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:20,139
That's not the
face of a tailor.

440
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,848
I'm not a tailor.

441
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,019
Not for the moment, anyway.

442
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,403
You know...

443
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,863
I once bought a suit from Garak.

444
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:39,617
Turns out the sleeve
was a little long.

445
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:44,997
I remember being angry
when I brought it back
to be fixed.

446
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,374
Is there a point
to this story?

447
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,376
If I'd known
he was so dangerous,

448
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,086
I never would've
complained.

449
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,299
You think he'll get
the other Cardassian?

450
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:58,718
I hope not. I want
to get him myself.

451
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,429
BOQ'TA:
I don't blame you.

452
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,264
AMARO:
Stolzoff was my friend.

453
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,725
We were
at the Academy together.

454
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:09,896
She was my sparring partner.

455
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,065
The first time we faced off,

456
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,860
I remember thinking
maybe I ought to
take it easy on her.

457
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,322
She ended up taking
me down so hard,

458
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:20,199
it knocked
the wind out of me.

459
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,993
(<i> tool buzzing</i> )

460
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:27,039
That was the last
time I ever pulled
a punch with her.

461
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,791
She had this
one-two combination--

462
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,836
a feint to the right,
a back-handed chop
to the neck--

463
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,712
faked me out every time.

464
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:37,757
If that spoon-head
gives me the chance,

465
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,843
maybe I'll just
try that out on him.

466
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,928
I think Stolzoff
would've liked that.

467
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,475
(<i> frustrated grunts</i> )

468
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:49,144
I can't get this loose.

469
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,480
Get me the coil spanner,
would you?

470
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,617
What does it look like?

471
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:04,951
It's got two pointy things
on the end.

472
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,912
(<i> Boq'ta screams</i> )

00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,831

00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:24,012
(<i> Amaro panting</i> )

476
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:36,275
He asked me to get
a coil spanner for him.

477
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,613
I just turned my
back for a second.

478
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:47,119
That's a shame.

479
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,829
And the worst part of it is...

480
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:54,418
this isn't a coil spanner.

481
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:56,420
(<i> gasping</i> )

482
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:00,048
It's a flux-coupler.

483
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,941
That should do it.

484
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,777
O'Brien to Boq'ta.

485
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:22,862
Boq'ta, come in.

486
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:26,992
Amaro, what's
going on up there?

487
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:40,839
(<i> labored gasp</i> )

488
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,800
H-he's out there.

489
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,427
Easy now, easy.
Who's out there?

490
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:49,348
Garak!
He stabbed me.

491
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,685
(<i> labored breathing</i> )

492
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:02,319
Chief, why would
Garak do this?

493
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,700
Come on.

494
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:11,704
He may still be close by.

495
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:36,395
It doesn't make any sense.

496
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,230
Garak's on our side.

497
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,148
Not anymore.

498
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,989
The psychotropic drug.

499
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,452
He must have been exposed to it.

500
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,913
It's the only explanation.

501
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,956
I should've seen it earlier.

502
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,503
The way he accused Amaro
of wanting to kill him.

503
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:04,464
The way he insisted on going
after those Cardassians.

504
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:07,926
He's coming after us,
isn't he?

505
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,847
Yes.

506
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:14,140
Maybe we can reason
with him.

507
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,143
Get him to try to
understand that the drug
is affecting him.

508
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,145
You saw what he did
to Amaro and the others.

509
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,899
He's not going
to listen to us.

510
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:24,401
Then we have to finish
setting up the deflector grid.

511
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:26,152
We've got to get
a distress signal out.

512
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:29,615
Garak knows what
we're trying to do.
He'll stop us.

513
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,950
Don't we have to try?

514
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,660
Forget it!

515
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,328
I've already lost four crewmen

516
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,372
trying to send out
that bloody signal.

517
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,959
Garak was right.

518
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,002
We should have gone
after those Cardassians

519
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,505
as soon as they attacked us.

520
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,716
You don't wait
for the enemy to come to you.

521
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:48,967
You go to him.

522
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,095
Come on.

523
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:55,849
We're going after Garak.

524
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:58,143
Y-you mean, to kill him?

525
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:01,897
If that's what it takes
to stop him, yes.

526
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:23,126
GARAK (<i> sing-songy</i> ):
I know you're hiding
somewhere...

527
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,340
Ah. There you are.

528
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:35,555
Garak to Chief O'Brien.

529
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,602
You'll never guess
what I just found.

530
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,771
A kotra board.

531
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,982
The Station Commander
left one in his office.

532
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:46,775
The pieces
were scattered all over,

533
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:49,903
but I found the last one
hiding under his desk.

534
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:52,906
I can't help thinking

535
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:54,992
what a perfect metaphor
this game is

536
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:56,827
for our present situation, hmm?

537
00:33:56,827 --> 00:34:00,497
Two players, two minds,
two strategies,

538
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:03,208
each trying
to outmaneuver the other--

539
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,712
testing the enemy's defenses,
advancing, retreating.

540
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,839
O'BRIEN: We split up.
Enter Ops through
the main corridor.

541
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:11,008
I'll go through
the Captain's office.
Wait for my signal.

542
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:12,759
...that, in the game
we're playing

543
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,928
the stakes are life and death,

544
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:17,389
which makes it
so much more interesting.

545
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:21,685
(<i> laughing</i> ):
I haven't had
this much fun in years.

546
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,353
My heart's pounding.

547
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:25,939
The blood's racing
through my veins.

548
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:28,358
I feel so alive...

549
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:31,110
and I'd wager, so do you.

550
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,282
(<i> grunts quietly</i> )

551
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,869
(<i> static from monitors</i> )

552
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,094
(<i> rapid breathing</i> )

553
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,906
(<i> grunting</i> )

554
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:17,657
(<i> yelling</i> )

555
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:26,750
It looks like I've captured
your last piece, Chief.

556
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,963
If you want it back,
you're going to have
to take it from me.

557
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,827
GARAK:
It's your move, Chief.

558
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,286
What are you going to do?

559
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,455
Attack? Retreat? Surrender?

560
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:07,373
Listen to me, Garak,
it's the drug.

561
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:10,209
It's affecting you.
You've got to fight it.

562
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,962
Fight it?
(<i> laughs</i> )

563
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:13,839
But I'm enjoying myself.

564
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,091
This is the most exciting
game I've played in years.

565
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:17,843
O'BRIEN:
It's not a game!

566
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:19,678
Oh, but it is,
and the best thing about it

567
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,513
is that it brings out
the player's true nature.

568
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:22,806
Where are you, Garak?!

569
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,349
I saw the look in your eyes

570
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:25,809
when I took the Ferengi
away from you.

571
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,602
You wanted to kill me.

572
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,229
You wanted to strangle me
with your bare hands.

573
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:33,441
I just want my crewman back,
that's all.

574
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,110
You're a killer, admit it.

575
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:38,155
We both are.
Behind your Federation mask

576
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:40,782
of decency and benevolence,
you're a predator,

577
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:43,201
just like me.

578
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,120
No, I'm nothing like you.

579
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,873
Oh, but you are.
You proved that on Setlik III.

580
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:49,541
How many Cardassians
did you kill?

581
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,084
Ten? 20? 100?

582
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:52,627
I don't remember.

583
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,379
Oh, but you remember
how you felt.

584
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,173
The Cardassians
were killing your men.

585
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:58,257
You had to stop them.
You had to make them pay.

586
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:00,719
Blood for blood!

587
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,139
You enjoyed killing them,
didn't you, huh?

588
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:08,560
You enjoyed watching the life
drain out of their eyes.

589
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,854
All right, Garak,
you want to finish this game?

590
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:12,731
Fine, let's finish it.

591
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,440
You and me, face to face.

592
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,736
Nothing would give me
greater pleasure.

593
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,905
We'll meet on the Promenade.

594
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:21,364
No weapons!

595
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,616
No weapons.

596
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:29,664
You have no idea how hard it is

597
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:33,543
to keep from pulling
this trigger,

598
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:36,254
but I need you alive.

599
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:03,049
GARAK:
They've come to cheer
you on, Chief--

600
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,509
your loyal team.

601
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,385
Apparently, they've
forgiven you

602
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,138
for getting
them all killed.

603
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,766
My supporters
may be fewer in number

604
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,476
but they're no less loyal.

605
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:20,150
I thought we agreed,
no weapons.

606
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,736
What's that in your hand?

607
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:26,614
Well, how did this get here?

608
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,662
Put yours down.

609
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:34,122
You first.

610
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:36,082
Put it down...

611
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,959
or say good-bye to the Ferengi.

612
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,669
Don't do it, Chief.

613
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,587
Oh, he has nothing
to worry about.

614
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,673
I'm not going to shoot
an unarmed man.

615
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:45,383
What fun would that be?

616
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:56,144
You wouldn't happen to have
another one, would you?

617
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:04,069
Naughty, naughty.

618
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,164
Your turn.

619
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:19,792
I admit I am tempted

620
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,003
to end this right now.

621
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:26,883
But that would be depriving
myself of too much enjoyment.

622
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,235
(<i> grunting</i> )

623
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,700
I'm disappointed, Chief.

624
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,203
I expected to see the bloodlust
in your eyes

625
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:57,122
but all I see is fear.

626
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,506
(<i> groans loudly</i> )

627
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:13,346
Maybe it's true.

628
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:16,266
Maybe you're<i> not</i>
a soldier anymore.

629
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:18,310
You're right.

630
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,103
I'm an engineer.

631
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:21,438
(<i> combadge beeps</i> )

632
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:23,022
(<i> electronic buzzing</i> )

633
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,565
(<i> grunting</i> )

634
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:35,368
You okay, Nog?

635
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:37,495
I'm all right, sir.

636
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,523
Is he dead?

637
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,275
Did you kill him?

638
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,402
No...

639
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:11,529
I didn't.

640
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:22,290
He should be all right
in a few days.

641
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,583
I've neutralized
the psychotropic compound

642
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,252
that was affecting
his nervous system.

643
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,964
He looks so peaceful.

644
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:33,218
It's hard to believe
he's the same man
who attacked us.

645
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,847
In a way, he's not.

646
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:40,641
The drug brought out
the worst parts of him

647
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,643
and allowed them
to take over.

648
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:45,271
He wasn't in control
of his actions.

649
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:48,983
Can I talk to him?

650
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,651
For a minute.

651
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:11,256
I thought you might like to know

652
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:14,008
that we salvaged
the plasma manifold.

653
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,261
It's being installed right now.

654
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:18,596
Mission accomplished.

655
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:24,269
I guess it didn't exactly go
the way any of us expected.

656
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,107
You know there's going
to be an inquest.

657
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:31,234
Yes. I've been told that.

658
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:36,281
Chief, I was hoping
to ask a favor.

659
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:37,990
Don't worry,
once they know the facts--

660
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,742
It's not about that.

661
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,955
I'd like you
to express my...

662
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,876
deepest regrets
to Amaro's wife.

663
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,587
I'd talk to her myself

664
00:43:50,587 --> 00:43:53,089
but I'm not sure
she'd welcome that.

665
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:54,715
I'll tell her.

666
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,135
I'd appreciate it.

667
00:43:57,135 --> 00:44:00,138
Julian tells me the blast
broke a couple of your ribs.

668
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:01,806
Well, it could have been worse.

669
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,641
If I'd been any closer
to that phaser

670
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,268
it would have killed me.

671
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:07,145
Don't take this
the wrong way,

672
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:09,063
but... that<i> was</i> the plan.

673
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,524
I understand.

674
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,528
See you around.
