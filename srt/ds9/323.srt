00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:04,296
(<i> Sisko humming</i> )

2
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:07,341
(<i> food sizzling</i> )

3
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:24,107
Hey, Dad.

4
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,359
Jake-o.

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,486
Take your seat.
Dinner's almost ready.

6
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:28,570
Hmm. Let me guess.

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,071
You've convinced
the Peljenites

8
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:32,157
to exchange Ambassadors
with the Federation.

9
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,742
How did you know
that? Ah!

10
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:36,036
You're cooking
chicken paprikish.

11
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,078
<i>Paprikash.</i>

12
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,455
You only cook
Hungarian food

13
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,415
when you're in
a really good mood.

14
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:43,210
You know, I always said
that you are a smart child.

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,628
Runs in
the family.

16
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,045
Huh.

17
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,218
You know, I have
some good news, too.

18
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,178
Captain Yates is
back on the station.

19
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,221
Huh.

20
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:56,849
Kasidy Yates.

21
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:58,141
Who?

22
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,060
The freighter captain
I told you about.

23
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,645
The one you want me
to meet.

24
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,355
I could, uh,
invite her over for dinner.

25
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:05,148
How about tomorrow night?

26
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:09,110
Jake, I think we're getting a
little ahead of ourselves here.

27
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,406
I know you want me to meet her,
and I will.

28
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,449
Just let me handle it my way.

29
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,660
You're going
to like her, Dad.

30
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,915
You never know.

31
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,384
The place is packed.

32
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:33,385
Where's Nog?

33
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,803
I gave him
the night off.

34
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,055
You what?

35
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:38,473
He's studying for
his Starfleet exams.

36
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,350
He's a very
dedicated student.

37
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,310
He's a disgrace
to this family

38
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,938
and to Ferengi
everywhere.

39
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,231
He should be here,
helping us earn profit,

40
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,776
not in his room learning
how to be more like a human.

41
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,694
He doesn't want to
be human, Brother.

42
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,529
He just wants to
join Starfleet.

43
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,906
It's the same thing.

44
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:56,742
Don't you see?
That's how it begins.

45
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,953
All it takes is for
one impressionable youngster

46
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:02,081
to join Starfleet,
and the next thing you know,

47
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,665
a whole generation
of Ferengi

48
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,667
will be quoting
the Prime Directive

49
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,920
and abandoning
the pursuit of latinum.

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,881
It's the end of Ferengi
civilization as we know it.

51
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:11,882
And it's all your fault.

52
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,341
Relax, Brother.

53
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,927
Nog isn't going
to destroy

54
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:16,219
the Ferengi way of life.

55
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,513
He just wants a job
with better hours.

56
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,765
(<i> chuckles</i> )

57
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,600
(<i> chuckles</i>
<i>patronizingly</i> )

58
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,939
You must be Quark.

59
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:29,066
That's me.
What can I
do for you?

60
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,234
Brunt, FCA.

61
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,404
The Ferengi
Commerce Authority.

62
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,117
A Writ of
Accountability.

63
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:39,242
We're in trouble.

64
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,577
All right, everyone.

65
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,830
The bar is closed.

66
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,331
Everybody out.

67
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,540
Go, go, go.

68
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,584
Now, everybody.

69
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,920
This way.
Everybody out!

70
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,880
Out.

71
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,133
Everybody out!

72
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:06,974
So, how do
you get to be

73
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,391
an FCA Liquidator,
anyway?

74
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,350
(<i> thud</i> )
(<i> yelps</i> )

75
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,936
Hard work, bribes

76
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,813
sucking up
to the boss--

77
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,731
just like
any other job.

78
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,525
Are these<i> all</i>
your assets?

79
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,652
Yes.
No.

80
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,653
(<i> thud</i> )
(<i> yelps</i> )

81
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,324
Down to the last slip
of latinum.

82
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:29,288
You realize concealing
financial information

83
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:30,872
from the FCA

84
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,083
could result
in severe fines.

85
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,127
I would never
dream of trying

86
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,420
to hide anything
from the FCA.

87
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,505
We'll see.

88
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,302
Uh, can I look over
those figures again?

89
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:44,719
Yes.

90
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:49,683
Wait a minute.

91
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,268
That can't be right.

92
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,978
Rom, you forgot

93
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,938
to include the
profit figures

94
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,815
for the tulaberry
wine franchise.

95
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,025
But you told me...

96
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,734
(<i> thud</i> )
(<i> gasps</i> )

97
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:03,280
Go get them now.

98
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,823
Yes, Brother.

99
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,620
You'll have to excuse Rom.

100
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,292
He means well, but he can be
a lobeless idiot sometimes.

101
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,710
Hmm.

102
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,920
Please, provide a dermal imprint

103
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,756
for FCA records.

104
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,218
But you haven't even told me
what I'm being charged with.

105
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:27,012
No, I haven't.

106
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,723
Oh!

107
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,433
How rude of me.

108
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,810
For your troubles.

109
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,312
You're being charged

110
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,689
with violating
Ferengi Trade Bylaw

111
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,984
Subsection 1,027,
Paragraph Three.

112
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,945
Subsection 1,027,
Paragraph Three?

113
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,780
I'm not sure I'm
familiar with that one.

114
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,367
Well, in that case, you
need a copy of the Bylaws.

115
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:52,037
Which you just happen to have.

116
00:06:55,749 --> 00:07:00,295
Subsection 1,027...

117
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:03,257
Paragraph Three.

118
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,633
"Improper supervision
of a family member."

119
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,802
You are being held accountable

120
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,597
for the criminal activities
of one Ishka

121
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,808
daughter of Adred,
wife of Keldar.

122
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:18,355
Ishka-- you mean
our mother.

123
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,689
What's she done?

124
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:31,243
She's charged
with... earning profit.

125
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,911
Earning profit?

126
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,788
Our Moogie?

127
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,880
Odo, I'm holding you
personally responsible

128
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,090
for the safety
of my bar

129
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,466
and my personal
possessions

130
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,343
for as long as I'm
off the station.

131
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,594
And make sure my
thieving brother

132
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,845
doesn't touch
anything.

133
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:51,805
Going somewhere?

134
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:52,931
Back to the
homeworld

135
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,015
to take care
of some business.

136
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,017
Little trouble
with the FCA?

137
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,061
How'd you know?

138
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,020
Huh.

139
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,188
I won't be gone long.

140
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,522
All I've got to do

141
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,150
is get my mother
to confess to her crimes,

142
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,484
and I'll be
on the next transport

143
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,526
back the station.

144
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,903
Your mother?
What's she done?

145
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,280
It doesn't matter.

146
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,449
The important thing is,
I'm required by law

147
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,284
to get her to admit
her wrongdoing,

148
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,369
make reparations,
and reveal her accomplices.

149
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,455
And that is
what I'm going to do.

150
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,165
Assuming she cooperates.

151
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,210
Well... she'd better.

152
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,879
I have no intention
of spending my latinum

153
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,674
to make restitution
for<i> her</i> crimes.

154
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,593
I will wring that confession
out of her, if I have to.

155
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,263
This is your<i> mother</i>
you're talking about?

156
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,973
Don't remind me.

157
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,518
Ah!

158
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,609
Ah-- Chief O'Brien
wants to know

159
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,694
when you can stop by

160
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,237
and inspect
the new runabout.

161
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,365
I'll be available
at 1400 hours.

162
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:52,366
Tell him that I want

163
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,741
to name it the<i> Rubicon.</i>

164
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,160
The<i> Rubicon</i> it is.

165
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,204
You know, the rate we
go through runabouts,

166
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,372
it's a good thing

167
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,580
the Earth has
so many rivers.

168
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,458
Hmm.

169
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,003
Have you met her yet?

170
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,048
Met who?

171
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,132
Captain Yates.

172
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:12,719
How did you know about her?

173
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,971
Jake introduced us.

174
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,724
So, are you going to
ask her out for dinner?

175
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,809
I'm considering it.

176
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,354
What did you think about her?

177
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,773
Let me just put it this way.

178
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,234
If I were Curzon,

179
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,736
I'd have stolen her
from you by now.

180
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,279
That's one of the reasons

181
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,032
I'm glad you're not
Curzon anymore.

182
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,624
(<i> whispering</i> )

183
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:46,961
Brother, wait!

184
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,463
I'm coming with you.

185
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:49,589
No, you're not.

186
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,965
Yes, I am.

187
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,509
What did I tell you
about contradicting me?

188
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,010
You told me
not to do it.

189
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,720
That's right, so you're
going to stay here

190
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,098
and watch over the
bar while I'm gone.

191
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,516
No, I'm not.
The bar is closed.

192
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,142
There's no reason
why I can't come along.

193
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,144
You want a reason?
I'll give you a reason.

194
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,022
I don't want you to.
And you know why?

195
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,025
Because you'll just
take her side.

196
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,318
You mean Moogie.

197
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,653
Yes, I mean Moogie.

198
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,156
Stop calling her by
that infantile nickname.

199
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,199
But she likes it.

200
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,367
Well, I don't.

201
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,577
Well, she does.

202
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:19,619
You see?

203
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,662
You always take her side.

204
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,747
Somebody has to.

205
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,040
After all, she is our mother.

206
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,375
Now, I'm coming with you,

207
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,334
and that's final.

208
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,919
All right!
Fine.

209
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,798
Come if you want.

210
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,884
Just remember
one thing:

211
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,720
This is between Moog...

212
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,265
Mother and me.

213
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,309
So if you know
what's good for you,

214
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,352
you'll stay out of the way.

215
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:01,495
(<i> thunder rumbling</i> )

216
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,093
(<i> shuddering</i> )

217
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,096
Welcome to our home.

218
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,602
Oh.

219
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,686
Um.

220
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:31,065
Please place your imprint
on the legal waivers

221
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,652
and deposit
your admission fee

222
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:35,862
in the box by the door.

223
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,240
Remember, my house
is my house.

224
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,576
As are its contents.

225
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,706
It's good to be back,
isn't it, Brother?

226
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,376
Now that you
mention it, no.

227
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,336
But you haven't been
here in 20 years.

228
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,712
If I had my way, I would
have been gone another 20.

229
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,215
Oh.

230
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,925
Hmm-- Mother certainly
has been acquiring

231
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,594
quite a few new things.

232
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,723
Uh, doubtless with the generous
stipend you give her.

233
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,726
Look, Brother.

234
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:11,147
The latinum tooth sharpener
I used when we were children.

235
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,773
All I had was

236
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,484
a cheap wooden
chew stick.

237
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,110
Excuse me
for interrupting,

238
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,737
but we do have business
to attend to.

239
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,365
As a registered Liquidator,

240
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,701
it's my duty to present
a formal list

241
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:25,036
of the infractions
committed by your mother.

242
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,329
You have three days
to obtain

243
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,497
an admission of guilt
from the accused.

244
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:28,747
Three days...
is that all?

245
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,833
If you're not able
to obtain

246
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,001
a confession, your mother

247
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,752
will be placed
in indentured servitude

248
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:34,962
and you will be required

249
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,464
to make restitution
for her crimes.

250
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,798
Do you understand
everything I've said to you?

251
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,758
FEMALE:
He understands,
all right.

252
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,636
Not that it matters.

253
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:44,180
I'm not confessing anything.

254
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,224
Moogie.

255
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,894
Oh, it's good
to see you, son.

256
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,021
You look well.

257
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,609
And you look...
dressed.

258
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:56,859
Oh! Now, now...

259
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:00,321
Your mother is wearing clothes.

260
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,324
Mother, get undressed
this instant.

261
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,743
Hello, Quark.

262
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:07,786
You haven't
changed a bit.

263
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,080
Perhaps I should leave.

264
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,457
Perhaps you should.

265
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,293
Wa... was she addressing me?

266
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,586
No, no, not at all.

267
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:16,212
ISHKA:
Of course I was.

268
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,423
This is my home, and I'll
speak to whomever I want.

269
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,759
But, Moogie, he's a stranger,
and you're female.

270
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,970
It's all right, Rom,
I know what I'm doing.

271
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,805
Perhaps you do,
but I will not stand here

272
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,433
and be spoken to by a female.

273
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:31,352
Wait, I'm sure there's
an explanation.

274
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,646
You have three days

275
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,355
to get your house
in order.

276
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,776
(<i> disgusted groans</i> )

277
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,488
Now, see what you've done.

278
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,781
Oh.

279
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,199
Quark, you're
upsetting your brother.

280
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,743
He's not
the only one

281
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,996
who's upset, not that
anyone cares how I feel.

282
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,165
That's not true.

283
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,625
I care.

284
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,711
Then imprint this
and take off those clothes.

285
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:57,712
I'm not doing

286
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,380
anything of the kind.

287
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,799
Yes, you are.

288
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,883
You're going to make
a full confession

289
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,594
so that I can go back to my bar

290
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:06,596
and pretend none of this
has ever happened.

291
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,889
You mean, we're leaving so soon?

292
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,057
Rom, this is your home.

293
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,101
You can stay
as long as you like.

294
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,521
Or leave whenever you like,
it's up to you.

295
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:23,988
Same old Moogie.

296
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,740
Yeah.

297
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,914
Are you sure this
is absolutely necessary?

298
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,291
Well, I
don't know

299
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,126
if I would call
it necessary.

300
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,170
Constable, there's
no telling

301
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,130
how long Quark
could be away.

302
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,923
All we want is
our dart board.

303
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,051
Well, can't you just replicate
another one?

304
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,177
We could.

305
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,679
But we're not going to.

306
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,264
That's our dart board,
and we want it back.

307
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,975
If Quark was going to run off,
the least he could do

308
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,227
is give us some warning

309
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,603
so we could retrieve
our property.

310
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,688
It's the principle
of the thing.

311
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,356
Hmm.

312
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:01,025
Well, getting it back might not
be as simple as you think.

313
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:04,028
This is one of Rom's
special security locks.

314
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,780
I've never seen anything

315
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,741
so convoluted.

316
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,450
SISKO:
Gentlemen...

317
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,951
is there a problem?

318
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,662
Ah, well, it seems that Quark

319
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,956
has locked some of Chief O'Brien
and Dr. Bashir's

320
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,291
personal property

321
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,126
inside the bar.

322
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,170
Ah, let me guess.

323
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,006
Your lucky dart board.

324
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,008
We never said it was
a "lucky" dart board.

325
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,636
We're just used to playing
on it, that's all.

326
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,555
A little defensive,
aren't they?

327
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,932
(<i> scoffs</i> )

328
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,308
Ah, well, it looks like

329
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,977
it's a tripartite
micro-sealing mechanism.

330
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,688
It's going to take
you a long time

331
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,690
to get through that one.

332
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,941
If you want any suggestions

333
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,359
I'll be in
Cargo Bay...
Four.

334
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,152
Huh? Seven.

335
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,030
Oh, uh...

336
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,408
well, I thought...

337
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:51,785
Thought what?

338
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,995
I thought you were going to...

339
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,083
talk to the freighter captain.

340
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,711
You know, uh,
Jake's friend?

341
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,963
Oh.
How do you two know about her?

342
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,715
BASHIR:
The Chief told me.

343
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:14,307
Exactly how many people has
Jake told about this woman?

344
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,769
Everyone.

345
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,731
Huh.

346
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:23,817
(<i> buzzing</i> )

347
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,693
Tube grubs,
extra juicy.

348
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,779
Just the way
you like them.

349
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:28,947
What are you doing?

350
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,030
Serving dinner.

351
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,658
That's
Mother's job.

352
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,242
She's not feeling well.

353
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,787
Not feeling well?

354
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:38,331
Wait a minute.

355
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:42,376
That's not bad.

356
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,587
We could say she's having
emotional problems.

357
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,673
We might even be able
to get the FCA

358
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,633
to drop the charges,
in light of her illness.

359
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,510
Actually, all she has
is a slight rash.

360
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,554
Her skin's still a little
sensitive to clothing.

361
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,933
That's hardly an excuse not
to serve her sons dinner.

362
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,309
Look at this.

363
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,937
She hasn't even softened
the grubs for us.

364
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,229
You know Moogie.

365
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,315
She never liked
chewing our food for us.

366
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,066
Not even when we were children.

367
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,319
Oh, she always had her own way
of doing things.

368
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,363
You remember
how the other children

369
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,698
used to tease us about her?

370
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,115
"Your mother won't chew
your food."

371
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,576
"Your mother
talks to strangers."

372
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,787
It's like she went
out of her way

373
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,247
to embarrass us...

374
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,000
not to mention Father.

375
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,253
Oh, I remember.

376
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,758
There were nights when
I would find him sitting

377
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,259
slumped in this chair.

378
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,345
He'd say to me,
"Quark, I don't know

379
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,597
what I'm going to do
about that female."

380
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:39,141
No wonder he never
earned much profit.

381
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,728
He was too busy
worrying about her.

382
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,062
I thought Father did
all right.

383
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,689
He could have
done a lot better

384
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,274
if she'd just
behaved herself,

385
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,737
showed him the
respect he deserved.

386
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,781
Well, she may have
dragged Father down,

387
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,325
but she's not doing
the same to me.

388
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,495
It's time someone
put her in her place.

389
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,915
Have anyone in mind
for the job?

390
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,469
Mmm...

391
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,889
Dank and musty.

392
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:20,099
I hand-picked them
from the cellar.

393
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,268
Mother, we need to talk.

394
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,519
Forget it, Quark.

395
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,396
I am not imprinting
the confession.

396
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:26,564
Why not?

397
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:27,982
Imprinting the confession

398
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,734
doesn't take away
from your achievement.

399
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,361
Just admit to what you did,
and tell the FCA the name

400
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,614
of any male who might
have helped you.

401
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,532
What exactly did she do,
Brother?

402
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,533
Never mind what she did.

403
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,659
Why don't
you tell him?

404
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,494
Or would you prefer I did?

405
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,329
All right.

406
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,583
She took a part of
the monthly stipend I send her

407
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,461
and invested it
in a Hupyrian beetle farm.

408
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,588
High-quality beetles.

409
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:51,714
The best.

410
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,007
ROM:
Really?

411
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,383
How much did you make, Moogie?

412
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,677
Three bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

413
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,805
ROM:
Three bars

414
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,098
of latinum?

415
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:02,475
Isn't the FCA
overreacting a little?

416
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,727
It doesn't matter
whether it's one slip

417
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,312
or a hundred thousand bars.

418
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:09,899
Females are not allowed
to earn profit!

419
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,484
Why not?!

420
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,820
Because it's the law,
and without law,

421
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,822
society would descend
into chaos.

422
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,574
If you ask me, this
society could use
a little chaos.

423
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,910
Not if I have anything
to say about it!

424
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,912
Gee, I wish Father
were alive.

425
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,872
Then it would be
just like old times,

426
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,500
sitting around the family table,
eating tube grubs,

427
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,003
discussing important issues
of the day.

428
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,966
(<i> sighs</i> )

429
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,052
Mother...

430
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,054
I know you're not

431
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,472
like other females.

432
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,223
You like to think about things.

433
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,558
You have opinions.

434
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,645
Is that a compliment
or an accusation?

435
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:48,646
It's a fact!

436
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,148
But what's also a fact

437
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:52,608
is if you don't imprint
this confession,

438
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,069
you'll be sold
into indentured servitude,

439
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,488
and I'll be forced
to make restitution.

440
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:00,116
But, Brother, it's only
three bars of latinum.

441
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:03,953
And I'm not going to let those
three bars destroy this family.

442
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,204
If our disgrace

443
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,747
is made known,
do you think

444
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,124
we can ever
do business

445
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,001
with another Ferengi again?

446
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:12,336
<i>I</i> wouldn't do business with<i> me.</i>

447
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:14,505
Mother!

448
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,883
Please!

449
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,595
For our family's reputation...

450
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,598
for your sons'
financial future...

451
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:28,352
please, imprint
the confession.

452
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,812
I can't.

453
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:34,150
I wish you could
understand, Quark.

454
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,276
I understand perfectly.

455
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,445
You're a selfish female

456
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,781
who never cared
about this family

457
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,783
about Father

458
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,326
or about me.

459
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:59,258
Oh...

460
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,302
I see you haven't changed
your bedroom, Moogie.

461
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,847
It's still very...
traditional.

462
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,516
I keep it this way
to remind myself

463
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,685
how idiotic Ferengi
tradition can be

464
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,063
when it comes to females.

465
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,106
Oh.

466
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,946
Rom, is something wrong?

467
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,906
Wrong? No.

468
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:24,283
Not... really.

469
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,661
Except... your clothes.

470
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:31,331
Would you feel more comfortable
if I took them off?

471
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:34,334
Well... maybe...

472
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,753
just a little.

473
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:38,338
All right, if it will
make you feel better.

474
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,800
But only for you.

475
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:46,722
Better?

476
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,348
Much!

477
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,271
(<i> sighs</i> )

478
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:54,396
(<i> slaps her leg</i> )

479
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,648
You know, Moogie...

480
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,276
it really would mean
a lot to Quark

481
00:21:58,276 --> 00:22:00,778
if you imprint that confession.

482
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,280
He's made that quite clear.

483
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,990
I know he can be
headstrong

484
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,324
and overbearing,

485
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:10,329
not to mention mean...
and insulting and rude,

486
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,290
but he's not<i> all</i> bad.

487
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,833
He works hard.

488
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,626
You should see
the bar.

489
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:16,752
It's thriving.

490
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,420
I'd like to.

491
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:22,008
But Ferengi tradition doesn't
allow females to travel.

492
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,302
Quark doesn't make the rules.

493
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:26,386
He just lives
by them.

494
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,264
Like a good Ferengi.

495
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:31,349
Like an unenlightened Ferengi.

496
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:37,106
Oh, Moogie, can't you give back
the three bars of latinum?

497
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:40,734
If you don't, you're going
to destroy everything

498
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,028
Quark's
worked for.

499
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,654
You always were a good boy.

500
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:46,240
I don't think Quark knows
how lucky he is

501
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,534
to have a brother
as loyal as you.

502
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:49,952
He knows.

503
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:52,955
He just doesn't like showing it.

504
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:56,209
If you cooperate with the FCA,

505
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:59,503
I bet I can convince him
to increase your stipend.

506
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,255
This isn't about money, Rom.

507
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:05,134
Quark has always been more
than generous with my stipend.

508
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:07,220
I have more than enough
to live on.

509
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,389
If it's not about money,
then what is it about?

510
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:13,809
It's about pride.

511
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:19,315
And knowing I'm just as capable
of earning profit as any male.

512
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:20,398
Don't you see?

513
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:22,109
If I imprint that confession,

514
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,904
I'll be admitting that
what I did was wrong.

515
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,240
I'm not going to do that.

516
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,784
I'd rather be sold
into servitude.

517
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,619
But what about Quark?

518
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,288
He's a
smart boy.

519
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:36,456
He can take care of himself.

520
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,209
Enough about your brother.

521
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:39,668
Let me see your teeth.

522
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:40,878
My teeth?

523
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,046
Why?

524
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,421
They're looking
a little dull.

525
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,715
Why don't you
sit here

526
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:47,467
and I'll sharpen them for you?

527
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,636
Here we are.

528
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,431
Oh, Moogie...

529
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,517
you're the best.

530
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,644
(<i> sharpener buzzing</i> )

531
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,397
(<i> Rom groans with pleasure</i> )

532
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,449
Oh!

533
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,369
Pardshay, don't
be an idiot.

534
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:16,372
Go get an antigrav sled
before you hurt yourself.

535
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:18,456
Why don't you

536
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:21,585
just beam it to your cargo hold?

537
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:24,880
Well, I wish I
could, but it's
unstable biomatter.

538
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,300
Oh, the transporter should
still be able to handle it,

539
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,594
as long as you adjust your
phase-transition inhibitor.

540
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:34,098
Provided I had a Mark
VII transporter.

541
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,852
You're still using
a Mark VI?

542
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:39,853
A Mark V.

543
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,272
Ah, a Mark V.

544
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:43,399
I thought they, ah,
stopped making those things...

545
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:44,858
15 years ago.

546
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,902
But when you're working
for the Petarians,

547
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,989
you have to make due with
what they give you.

548
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,073
Oh, let me guess...

549
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,075
Commander Sisko.

550
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,076
Benjamin.

551
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,244
Kasidy.

552
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:56,745
Kasidy Yates.

553
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:57,955
Yes, I know.

554
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:01,292
My son has told me
a lot about you.

555
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,668
Well, I think Jake

556
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:05,212
fancies himself something
of a matchmaker.

557
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,672
He means well.

558
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:09,842
He does get a little too
enthusiastic now and then.

559
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,718
(<i> crashing</i> )

560
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,887
Oh, damn, that sounds
like the inertium ore.

561
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,348
I better go see
what's going on.

562
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:16,390
I'll give you a hand.

563
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,267
I can take care of it.

564
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,853
Of course.

565
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:23,981
Sorry about Jake.

566
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,653
How about coffee?

567
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,780
Say tomorrow evening,
1800 hours?

568
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,990
Sounds good.

569
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,659
I'll see you tomorrow.

570
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,465
(<i> groaning</i> )

571
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,217
(<i> yawning</i> )

572
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,764
There's nothing like
sleeping in your old room.

573
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:01,227
So, how was
<i>your</i> night?

574
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:02,769
Mother's been busy.

575
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,689
Really? I didn't even know
she was up yet.

576
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:06,857
I mean

577
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:08,442
she's been<i> busy.</i>

578
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:11,237
I've been doing some checking.

579
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,989
This isn't about
three bars of latinum.

580
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,158
You mean
she earned more?

581
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:18,202
A lot more.

582
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,577
So much that I
haven't been able

583
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,455
to track it all down.

584
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:25,751
She's been operating
under dozens

585
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:29,046
of different aliases,
conducting transactions

586
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,507
all over
the Ferengi Alliance.

587
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,634
Do you know what this means?

588
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:37,930
It means Moogie's got
the lobes for business.

589
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:43,060
Even if I sold
everything I have,

590
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:47,814
I couldn't come close to paying
back what she's earned.

591
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,488
I'm ruined.

592
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,417
Brother?

593
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:13,466
I-I-Is everything all right?

594
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:15,593
Mm-hmm.

595
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:16,760
Oh...

596
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:20,347
I'm so proud of you, Quark.

597
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,100
I mean, other people
in your situation

598
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,394
might overreact and
lose their temper,

599
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,563
make a bad situation worse.

600
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,731
But not my brother. Hmm.

601
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,109
You're too smart for that.

602
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:36,155
You're going to sit there
and study the problem,

603
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:40,993
and then come up with
a clear, simple solution.

604
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:43,954
I already have.

605
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,872
Oh, you see?

606
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,707
I told you.

607
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,295
What is it?

608
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:54,756
I'm going to kill her.

609
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:59,052
(<i> yells</i> ):
Moogie!

610
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:01,679
Aha!

611
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,390
Caught you.

612
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,600
Give me that.

613
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,725
Give you what?

614
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,685
That padd you just hid.

615
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:10,230
It's a letter
to your cousin Stol.

616
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,690
Likely story.

617
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:15,486
Mm-hmm, I knew it.

618
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:17,530
You were trying
to hide more profits.

619
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,114
Well, it won't work.

620
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:22,034
I know all about your
little financial empire.

621
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,202
It's not so little.

622
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:24,203
Then you admit it?

623
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,787
Brother, calm down.

624
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,581
I'm sure Moogie has
a perfectly good explanation

625
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:28,582
for what she's done.

626
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:29,625
Don't you, Moogie?

627
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:30,917
Since when
does a Ferengi

628
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,128
have to make excuses
for making profit?

629
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,506
You're a female.

630
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:37,383
And when it comes to profit,

631
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:41,345
this female is a better Ferengi
than you'll ever be!

632
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:42,721
You expect me

633
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,391
to believe you did
all this on your own?

634
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:48,519
Oh, you had help.

635
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,521
Admit it.
Tell me his name.

636
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:52,772
I'll see to it the FCA
hangs him by his lobes

637
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,774
in the Sacred Marketplace.

638
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,278
Quark, sometimes you can be

639
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,697
so thickheaded.

640
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:01,657
Now, Moogie, there's no need
to be insulting.

641
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:02,908
Of course there is.

642
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,202
Insults are
the only thing he understands.

643
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:08,330
He's so blind with jealousy,
he can't even think straight.

644
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,623
Me?

645
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:11,542
Jealous of you?

646
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:12,585
Ho, ho.

647
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:15,128
You're just

648
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,714
like your father.

649
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,550
Why would Father
be jealous of you?

650
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,967
Because he knew

651
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:24,012
I had the lobes for business,
and he didn't.

652
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:27,140
I tried to help him--
give him financial advice--

653
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,519
but he wouldn't listen to me,
because I was a female.

654
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,438
What other reason
did he need?

655
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,147
Females don't belong
in business.

656
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,983
Give me one reason why not.

657
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,736
Because it's wrong.

658
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:41,988
You're going to have
to do better than that.

659
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,449
No I'm not.
It's the law.

660
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:45,451
That was good
enough for Father,

661
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:47,411
and it's good
enough for me.

662
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:50,872
A lot of things were good enough
for your father.

663
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,292
He was a lobeless failure!

664
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,835
And if you're not careful,
you're going to end up

665
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,588
just like him!

666
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:59,089
That does it!

667
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:00,882
ROM:
Brother, where
are you going?

668
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,510
To the FCA.

669
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,053
Let's see

670
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,846
what<i> they</i> 
have to say

671
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:09,808
about your financial empire.

672
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,485
Brother, wait.

673
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:20,736
Out of my way, Rom.

674
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,279
No, I'm not going to
let you hurt Mother.

675
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,697
She's no mother
of mine.

676
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:26,700
Why? Because of what
she said about Father?

677
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,453
Did it ever occur to you
that she might be right?

678
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:31,705
How dare you take her side
against Father's?!

679
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:34,249
Oh, don't tell
me about Father.

680
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,084
I knew him a lot
better than you did.

681
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,294
You went off
as soon as you

682
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:38,671
reached the Age
of Ascension,

683
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:39,838
but I stayed here
for ten more years.

684
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,298
Oh!

685
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:43,550
And you know what I learned
in those ten years?

686
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,762
I learned that Father
was no financial genius.

687
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:47,680
Take that back!

688
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,764
It's the truth!

689
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:49,973
(<i> yells</i> )

690
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,725
He went from one bad
deal to the next...

691
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,811
one failure
after another!

692
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:55,479
He couldn't hold
onto latinum

693
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,732
if you sewed it
into his pants!

694
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:00,150
Take that back!

695
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,401
No!

696
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,362
(<i> yells</i> )

697
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:23,131
Quark, Rom!

698
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,299
That's enough!

699
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,676
Let him

700
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:28,762
go!
But, Moogie!

701
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:29,971
Stop
it!

702
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,224
Stop it,
both of you!

703
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,934
If your brother wants
to go to the FCA,

704
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,228
let him.

705
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,270
But you'll get
in trouble.

706
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,772
I'll worry about that.

707
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,066
Go on. What are you
waiting for?!

708
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:01,127
(<i> thunder cracks</i> )

709
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,466
(<i> panting</i> )

710
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:18,896
That is the steepest
40 flights of stairs

711
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:21,523
I have ever climbed.

712
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:24,693
Seven strips of latinum
to use the elevator.

713
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,904
Talk about inflation.

714
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:28,614
(<i> panting</i> )

715
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:31,491
Huh, refined dilithium

716
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,243
down ten percent?

717
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:34,745
Huh.

718
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,458
The name's Quark.

719
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,835
I'm here to see
Liquidator Brunt.

720
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,798
Of course.

721
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:50,260
I'll tell Liquidator
Brunt you're here.

722
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,554
Have a seat.

723
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,726
How much?

724
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,895
Three slips.

725
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:00,896
I'll stand.

726
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,021
That'll be one slip.

727
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,149
I'll give you two
for the chair.

728
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:12,783
(<i> sighs</i> )

729
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:14,117
If you're here

730
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,077
to deliver
an imprinted confession,

731
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,663
you can leave it with me.

732
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:19,748
I'll see that
Liquidator
Brunt gets it.

733
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,792
Tell Brunt
I need to talk to him now.

734
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,669
I have information
that could shake

735
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:26,254
the very foundation
of the Ferengi Alliance.

736
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,297
Brother,
wait!

737
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:28,841
(<i> panting</i> )

738
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:31,969
I have to
sit down.

739
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:33,345
Uh-uh!

740
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,639
That'll be three slips
of latinum.

741
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:40,018
Brother... can you loan me...?

742
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,187
Yeah, yeah.

743
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:45,983
Here.

744
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:49,194
Now what do you want?

745
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:50,821
I have a message from Moogie.

746
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:52,948
There's nothing she could say
that would interest me.

747
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:55,158
She'll share it with you.

748
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:00,747
What was that?

749
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:04,668
Her profits, 50-50.

750
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:07,253
Tell Brunt I'll
talk to him later.

751
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,338
Come on.

752
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:10,048
Let's try out
that elevator.

753
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,758
But it's so
expensive.

754
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,176
I can afford it.

755
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,805
For your trouble.

756
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,276
Mother, I want
to apologize

757
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,905
for all the terrible
things I said.

758
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:35,657
I was angry and I
got carried away.

759
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,200
I'm sorry.

760
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:41,788
Apology accepted.

761
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:44,875
I'm just glad Rom
was able to catch you

762
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:47,544
before you made
a horrible mistake.

763
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,046
It would have
been a shame

764
00:34:49,046 --> 00:34:50,714
to waste all
of that profit.

765
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:53,132
I'm glad
we agree.

766
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,134
So...

767
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,220
how much latinum have you made?

768
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,889
Does it matter?

769
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:01,892
I just want to make sure that
everything is divided fairly.

770
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:03,142
Divided?!

771
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:05,228
50-50, just like you said.

772
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,022
I never said that.

773
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:08,690
You said he'd let me keep

774
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,484
all the profit
for myself!

775
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,111
I said no such thing.

776
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:17,616
So I lied...
to both of you.

777
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,325
I had no choice.

778
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,577
It was the only way

779
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:21,745
to get the two of
you talking again.

780
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,371
There's nothing to say!

781
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:26,792
Don't get your lobes caught
in the door on your way out!

782
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,126
ROM:
That's enough
bickering!

783
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,921
You're both acting
like children!

784
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,839
BOTH:
Who do you think...?

785
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:35,634
I will not stand by
and let this family fall apart!

786
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,427
Quark, you should be ashamed
of yourself.

787
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:40,889
I've seen you
treat Cardassians
with more respect

788
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,515
than you show
your own mother.

789
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:43,934
And, Moogie...

790
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:47,145
if Quark can uncover
your hidden investments,

791
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:51,108
eventually the FCA will, too!

792
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:54,319
And then all that profit
will be lost.

793
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,154
Think about that
for a moment.

794
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,908
Now, neither of you
is going to leave this room

795
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:02,160
until you've settled things!

796
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,496
Is that
clear?!

797
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:07,040
(<i> shouting</i> ):
And no shouting!

798
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,918
I'm going to take a nap.

799
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:18,093
He's a sweet boy.

800
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,220
That's easy
for you to say.

801
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,515
He doesn't live
next door to you.

802
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,936
You're too hard on him.

803
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,360
You always have been.

804
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,903
I had to be.

805
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,989
You were always too easy on him.

806
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:41,700
Maybe if you pushed him
a little bit harder,

807
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,994
he would have amounted
to something.

808
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:46,121
I doubt it.

809
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:49,749
When it comes to business,
he's a lot like your father.

810
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:53,962
You enjoy insulting Father,
don't you?

811
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,421
I'm not
insulting

812
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,756
anyone.

813
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,717
I'm just being honest.

814
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:01,678
Rom's a lot like his father.

815
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,973
And you...

816
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:08,643
I suppose, are a lot like me.

817
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,647
I never knew you felt like that.

818
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,191
Your father
might have bought you

819
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:18,486
your first copy
of<i> The Rules of Acquisition,</i>

820
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,198
but who helped you
memorize them?

821
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:22,657
You did.

822
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:26,452
I don't think
I've ever been prouder...

823
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:31,249
than the first time you made it
through all 285 Rules

824
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,878
without
a mistake.

825
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:37,630
Rom knows them
just as well as I do.

826
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,883
But<i> you</i> understand them.

827
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,345
Rom never did.

828
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,390
And neither
did his father.

829
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,684
But even if Keldar
didn't know

830
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,728
the first thing
about profit,

831
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:56,315
he knew everything
about family.

832
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:59,485
He was a good
husband...

833
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:02,072
and a wonderful father.

834
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:04,199
And I loved him
for that--

835
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,993
the way
I love Rom...

836
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:10,872
and the way I love you.

837
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,332
You mean that?

838
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:17,129
Yes, I suppose I do.

839
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:21,133
If it'll make you happy...

840
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,219
I'll give back the money.

841
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,263
You'll imprint the confession?

842
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:28,807
You're my son, Quark.
How can I refuse you?

843
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:31,601
You don't know how
much this means to me.

844
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:35,272
I know exactly how
much this means to you.

845
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:38,233
(<i> both laughing</i> )

846
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:42,154
Oh, Moogie...

847
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,825
I love you.

848
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:06,928
There's no place
like New Orleans

849
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:10,431
for simple pleasures--
good food, great music.

850
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,976
Hmm. Sounds like a
great place to grow up.

851
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:14,393
The best.

852
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,772
Can I get you
another<i> raktajino?</i>

853
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,399
Uh, no, I'm... fine.

854
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,655
You seem a little
preoccupied.

855
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:29,951
It's just, when we
made our plans,

856
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:34,580
I forgot, uh... I had
a previous engagement.

857
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,457
I see.

858
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,751
Oh, it's not what you think.

859
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:41,713
It's kind of a
family obligation.

860
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:44,382
You see, my youngest brother,
he's a colonist on Cestus III.

861
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,301
That's on the other side
of the Federation.

862
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:47,969
Well, it's
so far away

863
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:49,554
it takes two weeks
for a subspace transmission

864
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,597
to get here,
and I'm expecting one tonight.

865
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:53,933
I promised my brother
I'd listen to it as it came in.

866
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,144
I hope nothing's wrong.

867
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,729
Oh, not unless he
hurt himself again.

868
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:00,899
Last time, he tore some
ligaments in his knee.

869
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,817
How'd that
happen?

870
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,027
Uh...

871
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:05,403
he was doing something

872
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,322
called "sliding
into second."

873
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,159
S-s...

874
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,370
sliding into second?

875
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,495
Yes.

876
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,373
That sounds like baseball.

877
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:18,499
You know about baseball?

878
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:20,919
It's my favorite sport.

879
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,546
But no one has played it
for 200 years.

880
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,715
Well, they're playing it
on Cestus III.

881
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:28,801
At least, they have been
for the last six months.

882
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:29,761
I had no idea.

883
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:30,970
That's fantastic!

884
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,638
How many teams are there?

885
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:36,559
Uh, six, but they're trying
to organize a couple more.

886
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,396
I... I didn't know
you liked baseball.

887
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:43,024
I didn't know anyone else liked
baseball except me and Jake.

888
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:48,280
Uh, look, this transmission
I mentioned

889
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,031
uh, it's an audio recording
of a game

890
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:52,825
between my brother's team,
the Pike City Pioneers

891
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,160
and the Cestus Comets.

892
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,413
Uh... well, if you'd like,

893
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:59,207
you're welcome to listen
to it with me.

894
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:00,208
Well, I'd...

895
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,334
I'd love to.

896
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:02,335
Oh, great.

897
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:03,336
Well...

898
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:04,545
Oh...

899
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,089
Tell me, does your
brother's league

900
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:07,966
use a designated
hitter rule?

901
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,467
Oh, no, they thought
about it,

902
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,969
but decided
against it.

903
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,845
Ah. Wood bats or
polyduranide?

904
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,097
Wood, of course.

905
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:16,057
Do you think your
brother could use

906
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,350
a right-handed
pitcher?

907
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,018
(<i> laughing</i> ):
Oh, no.

908
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,701
BRUNT:
Everything seems

909
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,745
to be in order.

910
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,873
I'm glad we can finally
put an end to this matter.

911
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,541
I certainly hope<i> you</i>

912
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:43,960
have learned
your lesson.

913
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,754
(<i> sweetly</i> ):
And what would that be?

914
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,383
She's speaking to me again.

915
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:51,717
No, she
wasn't.

916
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:54,012
She's speaking to me.

917
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:58,183
Now, what were you
saying about a lesson?

918
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:00,143
Ah, the lesson is:

919
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:02,937
No one can outsmart
the FCA.

920
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:05,023
I think she's
certainly
learned that.

921
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,942
Your mother's confession
will serve as a warning

922
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,819
to females
all over the Alliance.

923
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:13,239
Oh, I don't think
anyone has to
know about this.

924
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,908
After all, what
would people say

925
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:18,870
if they knew
a female had earned...

926
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,663
that much latinum?

927
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,124
I shudder to think.

928
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:24,209
(<i> laughs</i> )

929
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:26,169
Good-bye.

930
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:32,758
I sincerely hope I never see
any of you again.

931
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,802
The feeling is mutual.

932
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:35,928
(<i> laughs</i> )

933
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,852
(<i> laughing sarcastically</i> )

934
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:44,770
I thought he'd never leave.

935
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:47,440
Mother... must you?

936
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,735
Quark, I've just given
up a sizable fortune.

937
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:53,071
I'm in no mood
for your nagging.

938
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:54,572
You're absolutely right.

939
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,075
If you want to wear clothes,
go ahead.

940
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:57,992
What do I care?

941
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,285
I'm leaving, anyway.

942
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,578
So soon?

943
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,747
I have to reopen the bar.

944
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,916
It's supporting all of us now.

945
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,293
Well, you know, you
could call your mother

946
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:10,088
every once in a while...
maybe even visit.

947
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,551
I will.

948
00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:16,386
I promise.

949
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:24,394
Let's go, Rom.

950
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:26,604
I'll be along
in a moment, Brother.

951
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:38,991
I'm glad to see
you two

952
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,868
are finally
getting along.

953
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:43,079
Yeah, I think
things will be

954
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:45,706
a lot better between
us from now on.

955
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,584
As long as he
doesn't find out

956
00:43:47,584 --> 00:43:49,085
you only gave
the FCA

957
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:50,378
a third
of your profits.

958
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:53,047
If you ask me, a
third was too much.

959
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,507
Well, it's
my own fault

960
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:56,217
for not hiding
it better.

961
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:58,761
You sure the FCA
won't find the rest?

962
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,346
I've got it
hidden so well,

963
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,223
I'll be lucky
if<i> I</i> can find it.

964
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:04,225
(<i> both chuckle</i> )

965
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,149
Oh, Moogie...

966
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:15,194
Now, Rom, don't start crying.
You'll get me doing it.

967
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,529
Go on, go on.

968
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:18,656
Quark's
waiting for you.

969
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:26,372
Take good care of your brother.
