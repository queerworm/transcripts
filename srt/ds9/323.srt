1
00:00:24,354 --> 00:00:25,448
Hey, Dad.

2
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,550
Jake-o.

3
00:00:26,592 --> 00:00:27,652
Take your seat.

4
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:28,789
Dinner's almost ready.

5
00:00:28,832 --> 00:00:29,892
Hmm. Let me guess.

6
00:00:29,935 --> 00:00:31,336
You've convinced the Peljenites

7
00:00:31,372 --> 00:00:33,434
to exchange Ambassadors
with the Federation.

8
00:00:33,477 --> 00:00:35,037
How did you know that? Ah!

9
00:00:35,081 --> 00:00:37,417
You're cooking
chicken paprikish.

10
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:38,515
Paprikash.

11
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:39,788
You only cook Hungarian food

12
00:00:39,828 --> 00:00:41,662
when you're
in a really good mood.

13
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:44,571
You know, I always said
that you are a smart child.

14
00:00:44,606 --> 00:00:45,802
Runs in the family.

15
00:00:45,843 --> 00:00:47,107
Huh.

16
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:52,551
You know, I have
some good news, too.

17
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,497
Captain Yates is
back on the station.

18
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:55,523
Huh.

19
00:00:57,172 --> 00:00:58,141
Kasidy Yates.

20
00:00:58,175 --> 00:00:59,269
Who?

21
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:01,475
The freighter captain
I told you about.

22
00:01:01,517 --> 00:01:03,077
The one you want me to meet.

23
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:04,751
I could, uh,
invite her over for dinner.

24
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:06,558
How about tomorrow night?

25
00:01:06,596 --> 00:01:10,869
Jake, I think we're getting a
little ahead of ourselves here.

26
00:01:10,908 --> 00:01:13,848
I know you want me to meet her,
and I will.

27
00:01:13,882 --> 00:01:15,944
Just let me handle it my way.

28
00:01:15,987 --> 00:01:17,890
You're going to like her, Dad.

29
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:22,270
You never know.

30
00:01:30,826 --> 00:01:33,732
The place is packed.

31
00:01:33,767 --> 00:01:34,736
Where's Nog?

32
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:36,295
I gave him the night off.

33
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:37,332
You what?

34
00:01:37,444 --> 00:01:39,848
He's studying
for his Starfleet exams.

35
00:01:39,883 --> 00:01:41,751
He's a very dedicated student.

36
00:01:41,788 --> 00:01:45,355
He's a disgrace to this family
and to Ferengi everywhere.

37
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,594
He should be here,
helping us earn profit

38
00:01:47,637 --> 00:01:50,166
not in his room learning
how to be more like a human.

39
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,010
He doesn't want
to be human, Brother.

40
00:01:52,048 --> 00:01:53,882
He just wants to join Starfleet.

41
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:55,388
It's the same thing.

42
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,552
Don't you see?
That's how it begins.

43
00:01:57,596 --> 00:02:00,398
All it takes is for
one impressionable youngster

44
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:03,271
to join Starfleet,
and the next thing you know

45
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,940
a whole generation of Ferengi

46
00:02:04,982 --> 00:02:06,953
will be quoting
the Prime Directive

47
00:02:06,987 --> 00:02:09,186
and abandoning
the pursuit of latinum.

48
00:02:09,225 --> 00:02:11,561
It's the end of Ferengi
civilization as we know it.

49
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,124
And it's all your fault.

50
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,196
Relax, Brother.

51
00:02:14,238 --> 00:02:17,337
Nog isn't going to destroy
the Ferengi way of life.

52
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,818
He just wants a job
with better hours.

53
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:28,541
You must be Quark.

54
00:02:28,576 --> 00:02:30,274
That's me.
What can I do for you?

55
00:02:30,314 --> 00:02:32,718
Brunt, FCA.

56
00:02:32,754 --> 00:02:35,887
The Ferengi
Commerce Authority.

57
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,364
A Writ of Accountability.

58
00:02:39,404 --> 00:02:40,634
We're in trouble.

59
00:02:40,674 --> 00:02:42,109
All right, everyone.

60
00:02:42,145 --> 00:02:44,139
The bar is closed.

61
00:02:44,183 --> 00:02:45,743
Everybody out.

62
00:02:45,788 --> 00:02:46,916
Go, go, go.

63
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:48,951
Now, everybody.

64
00:02:48,996 --> 00:02:51,195
This way.
Everybody out!

65
00:02:51,235 --> 00:02:53,172
Out.

66
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:55,371
Everybody out!

67
00:05:06,377 --> 00:05:09,111
So, how do you get to be
an FCA Liquidator, anyway?

68
00:05:10,221 --> 00:05:13,593
Hard work, bribes,
sucking up to the boss...

69
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,533
just like any other job.

70
00:05:15,568 --> 00:05:18,406
Are these all your assets?

71
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,434
- Yes.
- No.

72
00:05:22,051 --> 00:05:25,219
Down to the last slip
of latinum.

73
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:29,931
You realize concealing
financial information

74
00:05:29,972 --> 00:05:33,778
from the FCA
could result in severe fines.

75
00:05:33,815 --> 00:05:38,122
I would never dream of trying
to hide anything from the FCA.

76
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,322
We'll see.

77
00:05:41,435 --> 00:05:44,203
Uh, can I look over
those figures again?

78
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:45,542
Yes.

79
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:50,558
Wait a minute.

80
00:05:50,592 --> 00:05:51,959
That can't be right.

81
00:05:51,996 --> 00:05:55,802
Rom, you forgot
to include the profit figures

82
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,639
for the tulaberry wine
franchise.

83
00:05:57,677 --> 00:05:59,545
But you told me...

84
00:06:00,585 --> 00:06:03,957
Go get them now.

85
00:06:03,993 --> 00:06:05,588
Yes, Brother.

86
00:06:09,341 --> 00:06:11,471
You'll have to excuse Rom.

87
00:06:11,513 --> 00:06:15,980
He means well, but he can be
a lobeless idiot sometimes.

88
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:17,494
Hmm.

89
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:19,286
Please, provide a dermal imprint
for FCA records.

90
00:06:19,286 --> 00:06:22,226
Please, provide a dermal imprint
for FCA records.

91
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,732
But you haven't even told me
what I'm being charged with.

92
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,467
No, I haven't.

93
00:06:28,342 --> 00:06:30,108
Oh!

94
00:06:30,147 --> 00:06:31,777
How rude of me.

95
00:06:33,422 --> 00:06:34,550
For your troubles.

96
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:35,891
You're being charged

97
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,162
with violating
Ferengi Trade Bylaw

98
00:06:38,201 --> 00:06:41,369
Subsection 1,027,
Paragraph Three.

99
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:43,643
Subsection 1,027,
Paragraph Three?

100
00:06:43,682 --> 00:06:46,382
I'm not sure I'm familiar
with that one.

101
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:48,986
Well, in that case, you
need a copy of the Bylaws.

102
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:52,493
Which you just happen to have.

103
00:06:56,582 --> 00:07:00,923
Subsection 1,027...

104
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,728
Paragraph Three.

105
00:07:03,768 --> 00:07:06,240
"Improper supervision
of a family member."

106
00:07:06,274 --> 00:07:08,370
You are being held accountable

107
00:07:08,413 --> 00:07:11,215
for the criminal activities
of one Ishka

108
00:07:11,254 --> 00:07:14,285
daughter of Adred,
wife of Keldar.

109
00:07:15,532 --> 00:07:18,768
Ishka... you mean our mother.

110
00:07:18,807 --> 00:07:20,208
What's she done?

111
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:31,800
She's charged
with... earning profit.

112
00:07:31,841 --> 00:07:33,401
Earning profit?

113
00:07:33,444 --> 00:07:35,312
Our Moogie?

114
00:07:42,735 --> 00:07:44,797
Odo, I'm holding you
personally responsible

115
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:47,211
for the safety of my bar
and my personal possessions

116
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:48,807
for as long as I'm
off the station.

117
00:07:48,851 --> 00:07:50,320
And make sure
my thieving brother

118
00:07:50,355 --> 00:07:51,381
doesn't touch anything.

119
00:07:51,425 --> 00:07:52,553
Going somewhere?

120
00:07:52,594 --> 00:07:54,565
Back to the homeworld
to take care of some business.

121
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,570
Little trouble with the FCA?

122
00:07:56,638 --> 00:07:58,575
How'd you know?

123
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,579
Huh.

124
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,081
I won't be gone long.

125
00:08:01,117 --> 00:08:02,086
All I've got to do

126
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:03,645
is get my mother
to confess to her crimes

127
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,057
and I'll be
on the next transport

128
00:08:05,094 --> 00:08:06,063
back the station.

129
00:08:06,097 --> 00:08:07,430
Your mother?
What's she done?

130
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:08,959
It doesn't matter.

131
00:08:09,003 --> 00:08:11,065
The important thing is,
I'm required by law

132
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,740
to get her to admit
her wrongdoing

133
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,048
make reparations
and reveal her accomplices.

134
00:08:15,086 --> 00:08:16,852
And that is
what I'm going to do.

135
00:08:16,891 --> 00:08:18,794
Assuming she cooperates.

136
00:08:19,664 --> 00:08:22,763
Well... she'd better.

137
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:25,506
I have no intention
of spending my latinum

138
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,487
to make restitution
for her crimes.

139
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:31,393
I will wring that confession
out of her, if I have to.

140
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:33,958
This is your mother
you're talking about?

141
00:08:34,002 --> 00:08:36,098
Don't remind me.

142
00:08:37,511 --> 00:08:39,505
Ah!

143
00:08:45,632 --> 00:08:47,227
Ah... Chief O'Brien
wants to know

144
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:49,867
when you can stop by
and inspect the new runabout.

145
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,938
I'll be available at 1400 hours.

146
00:08:51,982 --> 00:08:54,386
Tell him that I want
to name it the <i>Rubicon.</i>

147
00:08:54,422 --> 00:08:55,755
The <i>Rubicon</i> it is.

148
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:57,820
You know, the rate
we go through runabouts

149
00:08:57,864 --> 00:09:00,234
it's a good thing
the Earth has so many rivers.

150
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,934
Hmm.

151
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,515
Have you met her yet?

152
00:09:06,854 --> 00:09:08,757
Met who?

153
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:09,852
Captain Yates.

154
00:09:09,895 --> 00:09:13,336
How did you know about her?

155
00:09:13,371 --> 00:09:15,866
Jake introduced us.

156
00:09:15,911 --> 00:09:18,509
So, are you going to ask her
out for dinner?

157
00:09:18,551 --> 00:09:20,385
I'm considering it.

158
00:09:20,422 --> 00:09:22,826
What did you think about her?

159
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:26,663
Let me just put it this way.

160
00:09:26,738 --> 00:09:30,578
If I were Curzon, I'd have
stolen her from you by now.

161
00:09:30,616 --> 00:09:32,280
That's one of the reasons

162
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,792
I'm glad you're not
Curzon anymore.

163
00:09:46,323 --> 00:09:47,724
Brother, wait!

164
00:09:47,827 --> 00:09:49,422
I'm coming with you.

165
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:50,559
No, you're not.

166
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,591
Yes, I am.

167
00:09:51,637 --> 00:09:53,505
What did I tell you
about contradicting me?

168
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:54,840
You told me not to do it.

169
00:09:54,878 --> 00:09:56,712
That's right, so you're
going to stay here

170
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,052
and watch over the bar
while I'm gone.

171
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:00,524
No, I'm not.
The bar is closed.

172
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,257
There's no reason
why I can't come along.

173
00:10:02,297 --> 00:10:04,200
You want a reason?
I'll give you a reason.

174
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,936
I don't want you to.
And you know why?

175
00:10:06,977 --> 00:10:09,779
Because you'll just
take her side.

176
00:10:09,884 --> 00:10:11,217
You mean Moogie.

177
00:10:11,254 --> 00:10:12,655
Yes, I mean Moogie.

178
00:10:12,692 --> 00:10:15,962
Stop calling her
by that infantile nickname.

179
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,264
But she likes it.

180
00:10:17,303 --> 00:10:18,329
Well, I don't.

181
00:10:18,373 --> 00:10:19,501
Well, she does.

182
00:10:19,543 --> 00:10:20,512
You see?

183
00:10:20,545 --> 00:10:22,516
You always take her side.

184
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,644
Somebody has to.

185
00:10:23,686 --> 00:10:24,916
After all, she is our mother.

186
00:10:24,956 --> 00:10:27,428
Now, I'm coming with you
and that's final.

187
00:10:27,463 --> 00:10:28,796
All right!
Fine.

188
00:10:31,206 --> 00:10:32,801
Come if you want.

189
00:10:32,844 --> 00:10:35,784
Just remember one thing:

190
00:10:35,818 --> 00:10:38,951
This is between Moog...

191
00:10:38,993 --> 00:10:41,227
Mother and me.

192
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,395
So if you know
what's good for you,

193
00:10:43,438 --> 00:10:45,170
you'll stay out of the way.

194
00:11:18,408 --> 00:11:20,276
Welcome to our home.

195
00:11:23,388 --> 00:11:25,690
Oh.

196
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,788
Um.

197
00:11:27,832 --> 00:11:31,296
Please place your imprint
on the legal waivers

198
00:11:31,341 --> 00:11:35,910
and deposit your admission fee
in the box by the door.

199
00:11:37,323 --> 00:11:39,453
Remember, my house is my house.

200
00:11:39,495 --> 00:11:42,024
As are its contents.

201
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:47,847
It's good to be back,
isn't it, Brother?

202
00:11:47,884 --> 00:11:49,616
Now that you mention it, no.

203
00:11:49,656 --> 00:11:52,128
But you haven't been
here in 20 years.

204
00:11:52,162 --> 00:11:54,691
If I had my way, I would
have been gone another 20.

205
00:11:54,735 --> 00:11:56,227
Oh.

206
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:58,243
Hmm... Mother certainly
has been acquiring

207
00:11:58,277 --> 00:11:59,975
quite a few new things.

208
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,924
Uh, doubtless with the generous
stipend you give her.

209
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,234
Look, Brother.

210
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:12,076
The latinum tooth sharpener
I used when we were children.

211
00:12:12,114 --> 00:12:14,780
All I had was
a cheap wooden chew stick.

212
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:16,485
Excuse me for interrupting

213
00:12:16,526 --> 00:12:18,964
but we do have business
to attend to.

214
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:20,731
As a registered Liquidator

215
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:23,207
it's my duty to present
a formal list

216
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,476
of the infractions
committed by your mother.

217
00:12:25,515 --> 00:12:26,541
You have three days to obtain

218
00:12:26,585 --> 00:12:28,020
an admission of guilt
from the accused.

219
00:12:28,055 --> 00:12:29,251
Three days...
is that all?

220
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:32,425
If you're not able to obtain
a confession, your mother

221
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:34,198
will be placed
in indentured servitude

222
00:12:34,238 --> 00:12:35,207
and you will be required

223
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,504
to make restitution
for her crimes.

224
00:12:36,544 --> 00:12:38,846
Do you understand
everything I've said to you?

225
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,182
He understands, all right.

226
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,986
Not that it matters.

227
00:12:42,024 --> 00:12:44,553
I'm not confessing anything.

228
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,830
Moogie.

229
00:12:47,873 --> 00:12:50,175
Oh, it's good to see you, son.

230
00:12:50,212 --> 00:12:52,446
You look well.

231
00:12:53,455 --> 00:12:55,927
And you look... dressed.

232
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:57,328
Oh! Now, now...

233
00:12:57,365 --> 00:13:00,898
Your mother is wearing clothes.

234
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:03,813
Mother, get undressed
this instant.

235
00:13:03,848 --> 00:13:05,317
Hello, Quark.

236
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:08,224
You haven't changed a bit.

237
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:09,489
Perhaps I should leave.

238
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:10,964
Perhaps you should.

239
00:13:11,969 --> 00:13:13,837
Wa... was she addressing me?

240
00:13:13,874 --> 00:13:15,207
No, no, not at all.

241
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:16,874
Of course I was.

242
00:13:16,915 --> 00:13:19,753
This is my home, and I'll speak
to whomever I want.

243
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,126
But, Moogie, he's a stranger,
and you're female.

244
00:13:22,162 --> 00:13:24,498
It's all right, Rom,
I know what I'm doing.

245
00:13:24,535 --> 00:13:27,064
Perhaps you do,
but I will not stand here

246
00:13:27,108 --> 00:13:28,942
and be spoken to by a female.

247
00:13:28,979 --> 00:13:31,747
Wait, I'm sure there's
an explanation.

248
00:13:31,787 --> 00:13:34,852
You have three days
to get your house in order.

249
00:13:39,707 --> 00:13:41,975
Now, see what you've done.

250
00:13:42,013 --> 00:13:43,312
Oh.

251
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,879
Quark, you're
upsetting your brother.

252
00:13:45,923 --> 00:13:47,358
He's not the only one

253
00:13:47,395 --> 00:13:50,563
who's upset, not that
anyone cares how I feel.

254
00:13:50,603 --> 00:13:52,699
That's not true.

255
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:54,301
I care.

256
00:13:54,346 --> 00:13:57,252
Then imprint this
and take off those clothes.

257
00:13:57,287 --> 00:14:00,125
I'm not doing
anything of the kind.

258
00:14:00,161 --> 00:14:01,528
Yes, you are.

259
00:14:01,564 --> 00:14:03,467
You're going to make
a full confession

260
00:14:03,502 --> 00:14:05,028
so that I can go back to my bar

261
00:14:05,073 --> 00:14:07,203
and pretend none of this
has ever happened.

262
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:09,479
You mean, we're leaving so soon?

263
00:14:09,518 --> 00:14:11,010
Rom, this is your home.

264
00:14:11,056 --> 00:14:12,686
You can stay
as long as you like.

265
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,925
Or leave whenever you like,
it's up to you.

266
00:14:23,221 --> 00:14:24,520
Same old Moogie.

267
00:14:24,557 --> 00:14:26,117
Yeah.

268
00:14:31,675 --> 00:14:34,547
Are you sure this
is absolutely necessary?

269
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,751
Well, I don't know
if I would call it necessary.

270
00:14:37,825 --> 00:14:41,767
Constable, there's no telling
how long Quark could be away.

271
00:14:41,836 --> 00:14:43,636
All we want is our dart board.

272
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,668
Well, can't you just replicate
another one?

273
00:14:45,712 --> 00:14:46,772
We could.

274
00:14:46,815 --> 00:14:48,250
But we're not going to.

275
00:14:48,286 --> 00:14:50,952
That's our dart board,
and we want it back.

276
00:14:50,992 --> 00:14:53,658
If Quark was going to run off,
the least he could do

277
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,794
is give us some warning

278
00:14:54,835 --> 00:14:56,304
so we could retrieve
our property.

279
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,673
It's the principle of the thing.

280
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,043
Hmm.

281
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,712
Well, getting it back might not
be as simple as you think.

282
00:15:01,754 --> 00:15:04,592
This is one of Rom's
special security locks.

283
00:15:04,628 --> 00:15:08,161
I've never seen anything
so convoluted.

284
00:15:08,204 --> 00:15:10,107
Gentlemen...

285
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,668
is there a problem?

286
00:15:11,713 --> 00:15:13,182
Ah, well, it seems that Quark

287
00:15:13,217 --> 00:15:16,350
has locked some of Chief O'Brien
and Dr. Bashir's

288
00:15:16,392 --> 00:15:19,696
personal property
inside the bar.

289
00:15:19,734 --> 00:15:21,898
Ah, let me guess.

290
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,812
Your lucky dart board.

291
00:15:24,847 --> 00:15:27,376
We never said it was
a "lucky" dart board.

292
00:15:27,421 --> 00:15:29,415
We're just used to playing
on it, that's all.

293
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,589
A little defensive, aren't they?

294
00:15:33,369 --> 00:15:34,929
Ah, well, it looks like

295
00:15:34,974 --> 00:15:37,846
it's a tripartite
micro-sealing mechanism.

296
00:15:37,881 --> 00:15:39,316
It's going to take you
a long time

297
00:15:39,352 --> 00:15:40,446
to get through that one.

298
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:42,790
If you want any suggestions

299
00:15:42,827 --> 00:15:44,126
- I'll be in Cargo Bay...
- Four.

300
00:15:44,164 --> 00:15:45,862
Huh? Seven.

301
00:15:47,473 --> 00:15:48,669
Oh, uh...

302
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,182
well, I thought...

303
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:52,480
Thought what?

304
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:55,823
I thought you were going to...

305
00:15:57,298 --> 00:15:59,896
talk to the freighter captain.

306
00:16:00,005 --> 00:16:02,569
You know, uh, Jake's friend?

307
00:16:02,612 --> 00:16:04,846
Oh.
How do you two know about her?

308
00:16:04,884 --> 00:16:06,548
The Chief told me.

309
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:15,043
Exactly how many people has
Jake told about this woman?

310
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,619
Everyone.

311
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:22,586
Huh.

312
00:16:24,736 --> 00:16:26,468
Tube grubs, extra juicy.

313
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:28,603
Just the way you like them.

314
00:16:28,646 --> 00:16:29,740
What are you doing?

315
00:16:29,782 --> 00:16:30,910
Serving dinner.

316
00:16:30,985 --> 00:16:32,386
That's Mother's job.

317
00:16:32,422 --> 00:16:34,052
She's not feeling well.

318
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,691
Not feeling well?

319
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:39,137
Wait a minute.

320
00:16:39,173 --> 00:16:42,011
That's not bad.

321
00:16:43,518 --> 00:16:45,614
We could say she's having
emotional problems.

322
00:16:45,656 --> 00:16:47,422
We might even be able
to get the FCA

323
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:49,591
to drop the charges,
in light of her illness.

324
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,502
Actually, all she has
is a slight rash.

325
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:54,445
Her skin's still a little
sensitive to clothing.

326
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,852
That's hardly an excuse not
to serve her sons dinner.

327
00:16:57,889 --> 00:16:59,256
Look at this.

328
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:01,821
She hasn't even softened
the grubs for us.

329
00:17:01,865 --> 00:17:03,129
You know Moogie.

330
00:17:03,168 --> 00:17:05,071
She never liked
chewing our food for us.

331
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,942
Not even when we were children.

332
00:17:07,046 --> 00:17:09,280
Oh, she always had her own way
of doing things.

333
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:11,152
You remember
how the other children

334
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:12,681
used to tease us about her?

335
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:14,961
"Your mother won't chew
your food."

336
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:16,628
"Your mother
talks to strangers."

337
00:17:16,671 --> 00:17:18,699
It's like she went
out of her way

338
00:17:18,742 --> 00:17:21,078
to embarrass us...

339
00:17:21,115 --> 00:17:22,847
not to mention Father.

340
00:17:23,923 --> 00:17:27,056
Oh, I remember.

341
00:17:28,668 --> 00:17:31,699
There were nights when
I would find him sitting

342
00:17:31,743 --> 00:17:33,212
slumped in this chair.

343
00:17:33,247 --> 00:17:35,275
He'd say to me,
"Quark, I don't know

344
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:37,655
what I'm going to do
about that female."

345
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:40,164
No wonder he never
earned much profit.

346
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:42,569
He was too busy
worrying about her.

347
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:44,039
I thought Father did
all right.

348
00:17:44,142 --> 00:17:48,917
He could have done a lot better
if she'd just behaved herself

349
00:17:48,955 --> 00:17:51,723
showed him
the respect he deserved.

350
00:17:51,762 --> 00:17:54,668
Well, she may have
dragged Father down

351
00:17:54,703 --> 00:17:57,301
but she's not doing
the same to me.

352
00:17:57,343 --> 00:18:00,340
It's time someone
put her in her place.

353
00:18:00,384 --> 00:18:02,856
Have anyone in mind for the job?

354
00:18:14,688 --> 00:18:16,248
Mmm...

355
00:18:16,292 --> 00:18:18,924
Dank and musty.

356
00:18:18,966 --> 00:18:21,062
I hand-picked them
from the cellar.

357
00:18:21,105 --> 00:18:23,269
Mother, we need to talk.

358
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,370
Forget it, Quark.

359
00:18:24,413 --> 00:18:26,350
I am not imprinting
the confession.

360
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:27,580
Why not?

361
00:18:27,621 --> 00:18:28,817
Imprinting the confession

362
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,795
doesn't take away
from your achievement.

363
00:18:30,829 --> 00:18:33,393
Just admit to what you did,
and tell the FCA the name

364
00:18:33,437 --> 00:18:35,636
of any male who might
have helped you.

365
00:18:35,675 --> 00:18:37,509
What exactly did she do,
Brother?

366
00:18:37,547 --> 00:18:38,641
Never mind what she did.

367
00:18:38,683 --> 00:18:39,743
Why don't you tell him?

368
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,518
Or would you prefer I did?

369
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:43,461
All right.

370
00:18:43,496 --> 00:18:46,664
She took a part of
the monthly stipend I send her

371
00:18:46,704 --> 00:18:49,542
and invested it
in a Hupyrian beetle farm.

372
00:18:49,578 --> 00:18:51,640
High-quality beetles.

373
00:18:51,684 --> 00:18:52,948
The best.

374
00:18:52,987 --> 00:18:54,081
Really?

375
00:18:54,124 --> 00:18:55,423
How much did you make, Moogie?

376
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,898
Three bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

377
00:18:57,934 --> 00:19:01,136
Three bars of latinum?

378
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:03,739
Isn't the FCA
overreacting a little?

379
00:19:03,782 --> 00:19:05,616
It doesn't matter
whether it's one slip

380
00:19:05,653 --> 00:19:07,283
or a hundred thousand bars.

381
00:19:07,325 --> 00:19:10,960
Females are not allowed
to earn profit!

382
00:19:11,001 --> 00:19:12,470
Why not?!

383
00:19:12,504 --> 00:19:14,908
Because it's the law,
and without law

384
00:19:14,944 --> 00:19:17,040
society would descend
into chaos.

385
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,521
If you ask me, this society
could use a little chaos.

386
00:19:19,556 --> 00:19:22,051
Not if I have anything
to say about it!

387
00:19:22,096 --> 00:19:24,033
Gee, I wish Father were alive.

388
00:19:24,068 --> 00:19:26,005
Then it would be
just like old times

389
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,808
sitting around the family table
eating tube grubs

390
00:19:28,847 --> 00:19:31,046
discussing important issues
of the day.

391
00:19:38,171 --> 00:19:39,197
Mother...

392
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:42,443
I know you're not
like other females.

393
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:44,544
You like to think about things.

394
00:19:44,587 --> 00:19:45,783
You have opinions.

395
00:19:45,824 --> 00:19:48,855
Is that a compliment
or an accusation?

396
00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:49,868
It's a fact!

397
00:19:49,902 --> 00:19:51,235
But what's also a fact

398
00:19:51,305 --> 00:19:53,709
is if you don't imprint
this confession

399
00:19:53,745 --> 00:19:56,240
you'll be sold
into indentured servitude

400
00:19:56,318 --> 00:19:58,756
and I'll be forced
to make restitution.

401
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,263
But, Brother, it's only
three bars of latinum.

402
00:20:01,331 --> 00:20:04,864
And I'm not going to let those
three bars destroy this family.

403
00:20:04,907 --> 00:20:07,938
If our disgrace
is made known, do you think

404
00:20:07,982 --> 00:20:11,150
we can ever do business
with another Ferengi again?

405
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,389
I wouldn't do business with me.

406
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:15,659
Mother!

407
00:20:15,702 --> 00:20:17,832
Please!

408
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,678
For our family's reputation...

409
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,660
for your son's
financial future...

410
00:20:25,694 --> 00:20:29,466
please, imprint the confession.

411
00:20:29,504 --> 00:20:31,099
I can't.

412
00:20:31,142 --> 00:20:35,279
I wish you could understand,
Quark.

413
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:37,347
I understand perfectly.

414
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:39,555
You're a selfish female

415
00:20:39,597 --> 00:20:42,001
who never cared
about this family

416
00:20:42,037 --> 00:20:43,803
about Father

417
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,437
or about me.

418
00:20:56,963 --> 00:20:59,458
Oh...

419
00:20:59,503 --> 00:21:02,500
I see you haven't changed
your bedroom, Moogie.

420
00:21:02,544 --> 00:21:05,142
It's still very...
traditional.

421
00:21:05,184 --> 00:21:07,816
I keep it this way
to remind myself

422
00:21:07,857 --> 00:21:09,851
how idiotic Ferengi
tradition can be

423
00:21:09,963 --> 00:21:12,401
when it comes to females.

424
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,497
Oh.

425
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,422
Rom, is something wrong?

426
00:21:20,457 --> 00:21:22,394
Wrong? No.

427
00:21:22,429 --> 00:21:24,663
Not... really.

428
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:28,165
Except... your clothes.

429
00:21:28,211 --> 00:21:31,778
Would you feel more comfortable
if I took them off?

430
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,760
Well... maybe...

431
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,320
just a little.

432
00:21:36,365 --> 00:21:39,932
All right, if it will
make you feel better.

433
00:21:39,975 --> 00:21:41,444
But only for you.

434
00:21:45,623 --> 00:21:47,218
Better?

435
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,752
Much!

436
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,207
You know, Moogie...

437
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,916
it really would mean
a lot to Quark

438
00:21:58,957 --> 00:22:01,361
if you imprint that confession.

439
00:22:01,397 --> 00:22:02,923
He's made that quite clear.

440
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,838
I know he can be headstrong
and overbearing

441
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:10,946
not to mention mean...
and insulting and rude

442
00:22:10,988 --> 00:22:12,891
but he's not all bad.

443
00:22:12,926 --> 00:22:14,361
He works hard.

444
00:22:14,397 --> 00:22:16,197
You should see the bar.

445
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:17,397
It's thriving.

446
00:22:17,438 --> 00:22:18,839
I'd like to.

447
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:22,578
But Ferengi tradition doesn't
allow females to travel.

448
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:24,989
Quark doesn't make the rules.

449
00:22:25,058 --> 00:22:26,790
He just lives by them.

450
00:22:26,829 --> 00:22:28,823
Like a good Ferengi.

451
00:22:28,868 --> 00:22:31,774
Like an unenlightened Ferengi.

452
00:22:34,148 --> 00:22:37,954
Oh, Moogie, can't you give back
the three bars of latinum?

453
00:22:37,991 --> 00:22:41,363
If you don't, you're going
to destroy everything

454
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,563
Quark's worked for.

455
00:22:42,604 --> 00:22:44,336
You always were a good boy.

456
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:46,973
I don't think Quark knows
how lucky he is

457
00:22:47,015 --> 00:22:49,145
to have a brother
as loyal as you.

458
00:22:49,187 --> 00:22:50,554
He knows.

459
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:53,496
He just doesn't like showing it.

460
00:22:54,902 --> 00:22:56,964
If you cooperate with the FCA

461
00:22:57,008 --> 00:23:00,210
I bet I can convince him
to increase your stipend.

462
00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:02,049
This isn't about money, Rom.

463
00:23:02,088 --> 00:23:05,723
Quark has always been more
than generous with my stipend.

464
00:23:05,764 --> 00:23:07,963
I have more than enough
to live on.

465
00:23:08,002 --> 00:23:12,035
If it's not about money,
then what is it about?

466
00:23:12,114 --> 00:23:14,450
It's about pride.

467
00:23:14,487 --> 00:23:20,025
And knowing I'm just as capable
of earning profit as any male.

468
00:23:20,068 --> 00:23:21,037
Don't you see?

469
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,870
If I imprint that confession

470
00:23:22,908 --> 00:23:25,506
I'll be admitting that
what I did was wrong.

471
00:23:25,548 --> 00:23:28,020
I'm not going to do that.

472
00:23:28,054 --> 00:23:31,392
I'd rather be sold
into servitude.

473
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,367
But what about Quark?

474
00:23:33,402 --> 00:23:34,997
He's a smart boy.

475
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,942
He can take care of himself.

476
00:23:36,978 --> 00:23:38,744
Enough about your brother.

477
00:23:38,782 --> 00:23:40,274
Let me see your teeth.

478
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,550
My teeth?

479
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,616
Why?

480
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,220
They're looking a little dull.

481
00:23:44,263 --> 00:23:48,137
Why don't you sit here
and I'll sharpen them for you?

482
00:23:48,173 --> 00:23:50,269
Here we are.

483
00:23:52,986 --> 00:23:54,148
Oh, Moogie...

484
00:23:54,189 --> 00:23:56,251
you're the best.

485
00:24:10,265 --> 00:24:12,133
Oh!

486
00:24:12,203 --> 00:24:14,140
Pardshay, don't be an idiot.

487
00:24:14,174 --> 00:24:16,840
Go get an antigrav sled
before you hurt yourself.

488
00:24:18,151 --> 00:24:20,715
Why don't you just beam it
to your cargo hold?

489
00:24:22,396 --> 00:24:25,700
Well, I wish I could,
but it's unstable biomatter.

490
00:24:25,737 --> 00:24:28,471
Oh, the transporter should
still be able to handle it

491
00:24:28,512 --> 00:24:31,452
as long as you adjust your
phase-transition inhibitor.

492
00:24:31,486 --> 00:24:34,654
Provided I had a Mark
VII transporter.

493
00:24:37,501 --> 00:24:39,472
You're still using a Mark VI?

494
00:24:39,506 --> 00:24:40,475
A Mark V.

495
00:24:40,509 --> 00:24:41,808
Ah, a Mark V.

496
00:24:41,846 --> 00:24:44,512
I thought they, ah,
stopped making those things...

497
00:24:44,553 --> 00:24:45,783
15 years ago.

498
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,126
But when you're working
for the Petarians

499
00:24:48,162 --> 00:24:50,634
you have to make due with
what they give you.

500
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:51,831
Oh, let me guess...

501
00:24:51,872 --> 00:24:53,843
Commander Sisko.

502
00:24:53,877 --> 00:24:54,846
Benjamin.

503
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,849
Kasidy.

504
00:24:55,883 --> 00:24:57,443
Kasidy Yates.

505
00:24:57,487 --> 00:24:58,649
Yes, I know.

506
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:02,096
My son has told me
a lot about you.

507
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,329
Well, I think Jake

508
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:06,035
fancies himself something
of a matchmaker.

509
00:25:06,076 --> 00:25:07,511
He means well.

510
00:25:07,546 --> 00:25:10,611
He does get a little too
enthusiastic now and then.

511
00:25:12,492 --> 00:25:14,760
Oh, damn, that sounds
like the inertium ore.

512
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,166
I better go see what's going on.

513
00:25:16,202 --> 00:25:17,228
I'll give you a hand.

514
00:25:17,272 --> 00:25:19,072
I can take care of it.

515
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:21,478
Of course.

516
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,757
Sorry about Jake.

517
00:25:28,033 --> 00:25:29,263
How about coffee?

518
00:25:29,336 --> 00:25:31,466
Say tomorrow evening,
1800 hours?

519
00:25:31,508 --> 00:25:33,844
Sounds good.

520
00:25:33,881 --> 00:25:36,353
I'll see you tomorrow.

521
00:25:55,738 --> 00:25:58,644
There's nothing like
sleeping in your old room.

522
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:02,051
So, how was your night?

523
00:26:02,087 --> 00:26:03,717
Mother's been busy.

524
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:06,493
Really? I didn't even know
she was up yet.

525
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:09,300
I mean, she's been busy.

526
00:26:09,407 --> 00:26:12,245
I've been doing some checking.

527
00:26:12,281 --> 00:26:14,776
This isn't about
three bars of latinum.

528
00:26:14,821 --> 00:26:16,883
You mean she earned more?

529
00:26:16,926 --> 00:26:18,988
A lot more.

530
00:26:19,031 --> 00:26:23,168
So much that I haven't been able
to track it all down.

531
00:26:24,246 --> 00:26:26,616
She's been operating
under dozens

532
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:29,956
of different aliases,
conducting transactions

533
00:26:29,994 --> 00:26:32,364
all over the Ferengi Alliance.

534
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:35,635
Do you know what this means?

535
00:26:35,675 --> 00:26:38,740
It means Moogie's got
the lobes for business.

536
00:26:41,256 --> 00:26:43,956
Even if I sold everything I have

537
00:26:43,996 --> 00:26:48,667
I couldn't come close to paying
back what she's earned.

538
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,419
I'm ruined.

539
00:27:05,318 --> 00:27:06,344
Brother?

540
00:27:11,134 --> 00:27:13,402
L-l-ls everything all right?

541
00:27:14,743 --> 00:27:15,734
Mm-hmm.

542
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:16,839
Oh...

543
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,518
I'm so proud of you, Quark.

544
00:27:20,592 --> 00:27:23,224
I mean, other people
in your situation

545
00:27:23,265 --> 00:27:25,395
might overreact
and lose their temper

546
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:27,705
make a bad situation worse.

547
00:27:27,743 --> 00:27:29,873
But not my brother. Hmm.

548
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:32,286
You're too smart for that.

549
00:27:32,322 --> 00:27:36,287
You're going to sit there
and study the problem

550
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:41,074
and then come up with
a clear, simple solution.

551
00:27:42,749 --> 00:27:43,877
I already have.

552
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,822
Oh, you see?

553
00:27:45,857 --> 00:27:47,691
I told you.

554
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,235
What is it?

555
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:54,735
I'm going to kill her.

556
00:27:56,819 --> 00:27:58,983
Moogie!

557
00:28:00,662 --> 00:28:01,722
Aha!

558
00:28:01,766 --> 00:28:03,292
Caught you.

559
00:28:03,336 --> 00:28:04,464
Give me that.

560
00:28:04,506 --> 00:28:05,668
Give you what?

561
00:28:05,709 --> 00:28:07,771
That padd you just hid.

562
00:28:07,814 --> 00:28:10,116
It's a letter
to your cousin Stol.

563
00:28:10,154 --> 00:28:12,456
Likely story.

564
00:28:14,365 --> 00:28:15,595
Mm-hmm, I knew it.

565
00:28:15,635 --> 00:28:17,572
You were trying
to hide more profits.

566
00:28:17,606 --> 00:28:19,041
Well, it won't work.

567
00:28:19,077 --> 00:28:21,983
I know all about your
little financial empire.

568
00:28:22,018 --> 00:28:23,112
It's not so little.

569
00:28:23,154 --> 00:28:24,214
Then you admit it?

570
00:28:24,256 --> 00:28:25,316
Brother, calm down.

571
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:27,455
I'm sure Moogie has
a perfectly good explanation

572
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:28,468
for what she's done.

573
00:28:28,501 --> 00:28:29,470
Don't you, Moogie?

574
00:28:29,504 --> 00:28:30,530
Since when does a Ferengi

575
00:28:30,574 --> 00:28:33,069
have to make excuses
for making profit?

576
00:28:33,114 --> 00:28:35,552
You're a female.

577
00:28:35,587 --> 00:28:37,353
And when it comes to profit

578
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:41,663
this female is a better Ferengi
than you'll ever be!

579
00:28:41,768 --> 00:28:42,862
You expect me

580
00:28:42,905 --> 00:28:45,309
to believe you did all this
on your own?

581
00:28:45,345 --> 00:28:48,478
Oh, you had help.

582
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,514
Admit it.
Tell me his name.

583
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:52,792
I'll see to it the FCA
hangs him by his lobes

584
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,597
in the Sacred Marketplace.

585
00:28:56,741 --> 00:28:59,715
Quark, sometimes you can be
so thickheaded.

586
00:28:59,749 --> 00:29:01,720
Now, Moogie, there's no need
to be insulting.

587
00:29:01,754 --> 00:29:02,653
Of course there is.

588
00:29:02,757 --> 00:29:05,321
Insults are
the only thing he understands.

589
00:29:05,363 --> 00:29:08,394
He's so blind with jealousy,
he can't even think straight.

590
00:29:08,438 --> 00:29:09,464
Me?

591
00:29:09,508 --> 00:29:11,604
Jealous of you?

592
00:29:11,646 --> 00:29:12,637
Ho, ho.

593
00:29:12,683 --> 00:29:16,750
You're just like your father.

594
00:29:17,862 --> 00:29:19,958
Why would Father
be jealous of you?

595
00:29:20,002 --> 00:29:21,198
Because he knew

596
00:29:21,238 --> 00:29:24,076
I had the lobes for business,
and he didn't.

597
00:29:24,112 --> 00:29:27,177
I tried to help him...
give him financial advice...

598
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,684
but he wouldn't listen to me,
because I was a female.

599
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,394
What other reason did he need?

600
00:29:32,433 --> 00:29:34,301
Females don't belong
in business.

601
00:29:34,338 --> 00:29:37,176
Give me one reason why not.

602
00:29:37,213 --> 00:29:38,945
Because it's wrong.

603
00:29:38,984 --> 00:29:42,322
You're going to have
to do better than that.

604
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,658
No I'm not.
It's the law.

605
00:29:43,696 --> 00:29:45,690
That was good enough for Father

606
00:29:45,735 --> 00:29:47,569
and it's good enough for me.

607
00:29:47,607 --> 00:29:51,447
A lot of things were good enough
for your father.

608
00:29:51,483 --> 00:29:53,545
He was a lobeless failure!

609
00:29:53,588 --> 00:29:56,026
And if you're not careful,
you're going to end up

610
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:57,794
just like him!

611
00:29:57,833 --> 00:29:59,166
That does it!

612
00:29:59,203 --> 00:30:00,969
Brother, where are you going?

613
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:03,503
To the FCA.

614
00:30:03,548 --> 00:30:09,690
Let's see what they have to say
about your financial empire.

615
00:30:18,553 --> 00:30:19,522
Brother, wait.

616
00:30:19,556 --> 00:30:20,855
Out of my way, Rom.

617
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,520
No, I'm not going
to let you hurt Mother.

618
00:30:22,563 --> 00:30:23,862
She's no mother of mine.

619
00:30:23,901 --> 00:30:26,669
Why? Because of what she said
about Father?

620
00:30:26,708 --> 00:30:29,510
Did it ever occur to you
that she might be right?

621
00:30:29,549 --> 00:30:31,713
How dare you take her side
against Father's?!

622
00:30:31,754 --> 00:30:34,318
Oh, don't tell me about Father.

623
00:30:34,361 --> 00:30:36,264
I knew him a lot better
than you did.

624
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:38,737
You went off as soon as you
reached the Age of Ascension

625
00:30:38,772 --> 00:30:40,173
but I stayed here
for ten more years.

626
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,270
Oh!

627
00:30:41,312 --> 00:30:43,580
And you know what I learned
in those ten years?

628
00:30:43,618 --> 00:30:46,922
I learned that Father
was no financial genius.

629
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,929
Take that back!

630
00:30:47,963 --> 00:30:48,954
It's the truth!

631
00:30:49,968 --> 00:30:51,939
He went from one bad
deal to the next...

632
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:54,035
one failure after another!

633
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:58,716
He couldn't hold onto latinum
if you sewed it into his pants!

634
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:00,249
Take that back!

635
00:31:00,295 --> 00:31:01,457
No!

636
00:31:21,016 --> 00:31:23,454
Quark, Rom!

637
00:31:23,489 --> 00:31:24,651
That's enough!

638
00:31:24,692 --> 00:31:27,825
Let him go!

639
00:31:27,867 --> 00:31:28,961
But, Moogie!

640
00:31:29,003 --> 00:31:30,131
Stop it!

641
00:31:30,172 --> 00:31:31,402
Stop it, both of you!

642
00:31:32,512 --> 00:31:36,615
If your brother wants
to go to the FCA, let him.

643
00:31:36,656 --> 00:31:37,920
But you'll get in trouble.

644
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,122
I'll worry about that.

645
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:41,191
Go on.
What are you waiting for?!

646
00:32:13,857 --> 00:32:18,164
That is the steepest
40 flights of stairs

647
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:20,139
I have ever climbed.

648
00:32:20,173 --> 00:32:23,979
Seven strips of latinum
to use the elevator.

649
00:32:24,016 --> 00:32:26,146
Talk about inflation.

650
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,431
Huh, refined dilithium
down ten percent?

651
00:32:32,472 --> 00:32:33,998
Huh.

652
00:32:36,516 --> 00:32:38,646
The name's Quark.

653
00:32:38,688 --> 00:32:40,750
I'm here to see
Liquidator Brunt.

654
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:45,067
Of course.

655
00:32:46,542 --> 00:32:49,310
I'll tell Liquidator Brunt
you're here.

656
00:32:49,349 --> 00:32:51,548
Have a seat.

657
00:32:55,298 --> 00:32:56,733
How much?

658
00:32:56,769 --> 00:32:58,865
Three slips.

659
00:32:58,907 --> 00:33:00,069
I'll stand.

660
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,204
That'll be one slip.

661
00:33:01,247 --> 00:33:03,241
I'll give you two for the chair.

662
00:33:12,008 --> 00:33:15,278
If you're here to deliver
an imprinted confession

663
00:33:15,316 --> 00:33:16,911
you can leave it with me.

664
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:18,788
I'll see that Liquidator Brunt
gets it.

665
00:33:18,826 --> 00:33:20,990
Tell Brunt
I need to talk to him now.

666
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:22,900
I have information
that could shake

667
00:33:22,937 --> 00:33:25,341
the very foundation
of the Ferengi Alliance.

668
00:33:25,376 --> 00:33:26,367
Brother, wait!

669
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,087
I have to sit down.

670
00:33:31,158 --> 00:33:32,525
Uh-uh!

671
00:33:32,561 --> 00:33:34,623
That'll be three slips
of latinum.

672
00:33:35,736 --> 00:33:39,074
Brother... can you loan me?

673
00:33:39,111 --> 00:33:41,275
Yeah, yeah.

674
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,923
Here.

675
00:33:46,732 --> 00:33:48,258
Now what do you want?

676
00:33:48,302 --> 00:33:49,669
I have a message from Moogie.

677
00:33:49,706 --> 00:33:52,076
There's nothing she could say
that would interest me.

678
00:33:52,112 --> 00:33:54,276
She'll share it with you.

679
00:33:58,228 --> 00:33:59,754
What was that?

680
00:33:59,798 --> 00:34:02,738
Her profits, 50-50.

681
00:34:04,076 --> 00:34:06,310
Tell Brunt
I'll talk to him later.

682
00:34:06,349 --> 00:34:07,409
Come on.

683
00:34:07,452 --> 00:34:09,218
Let's try out that elevator.

684
00:34:09,257 --> 00:34:10,726
But it's so expensive.

685
00:34:10,761 --> 00:34:12,253
I can afford it.

686
00:34:13,769 --> 00:34:15,763
For your trouble.

687
00:34:27,471 --> 00:34:29,408
Mother, I want to apologize

688
00:34:29,443 --> 00:34:31,915
for all the terrible
things I said.

689
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:34,717
I was angry and I
got carried away.

690
00:34:34,756 --> 00:34:36,316
I'm sorry.

691
00:34:37,831 --> 00:34:41,135
Apology accepted.

692
00:34:41,173 --> 00:34:43,975
I'm just glad Rom
was able to catch you

693
00:34:44,013 --> 00:34:46,645
before you made
a horrible mistake.

694
00:34:46,687 --> 00:34:50,093
It would have been a shame
to waste all of that profit.

695
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,294
I'm glad we agree.

696
00:34:53,304 --> 00:34:54,330
So...

697
00:34:54,374 --> 00:34:56,402
how much latinum have you made?

698
00:34:56,446 --> 00:34:57,847
Does it matter?

699
00:34:57,883 --> 00:35:00,914
I just want to make sure that
everything is divided fairly.

700
00:35:00,957 --> 00:35:02,324
Divided?!

701
00:35:02,361 --> 00:35:04,423
50-50, just like you said.

702
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:06,301
I never said that.

703
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:08,002
You said he'd let me keep

704
00:35:08,042 --> 00:35:10,640
all the profit for myself!

705
00:35:10,683 --> 00:35:12,243
I said no such thing.

706
00:35:14,192 --> 00:35:16,664
So I lied... to both of you.

707
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,566
I had no choice.

708
00:35:18,603 --> 00:35:19,572
It was the only way

709
00:35:19,606 --> 00:35:21,007
to get the two of you
talking again.

710
00:35:21,043 --> 00:35:22,512
There's nothing to say!

711
00:35:22,547 --> 00:35:26,353
Don't get your lobes caught
in the door on your way out!

712
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,518
That's enough bickering!

713
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,226
You're both acting
like children!

714
00:35:30,267 --> 00:35:32,135
Who do you think?

715
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:34,804
I will not stand by
and let this family fall apart!

716
00:35:34,845 --> 00:35:36,907
Quark, you should be ashamed
of yourself.

717
00:35:36,951 --> 00:35:40,187
I've seen you treat Cardassians
with more respect

718
00:35:40,226 --> 00:35:41,786
than you show your own mother.

719
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,231
And, Moogie...

720
00:35:43,268 --> 00:35:47,301
if Quark can uncover
your hidden investments

721
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:50,317
eventually the FCA will, too!

722
00:35:50,386 --> 00:35:53,519
And then all that profit
will be lost.

723
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,463
Think about that for a moment.

724
00:35:55,499 --> 00:35:59,236
Now, neither of you
is going to leave this room

725
00:35:59,275 --> 00:36:01,543
until you've settled things!

726
00:36:01,581 --> 00:36:03,711
Is that clear?!

727
00:36:03,753 --> 00:36:06,089
And no shouting!

728
00:36:07,263 --> 00:36:08,927
I'm going to take a nap.

729
00:36:14,819 --> 00:36:16,983
He's a sweet boy.

730
00:36:18,328 --> 00:36:20,162
That's easy for you to say.

731
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,330
He doesn't live
next door to you.

732
00:36:24,678 --> 00:36:26,672
You're too hard on him.

733
00:36:32,364 --> 00:36:34,426
You always have been.

734
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,666
I had to be.

735
00:36:35,707 --> 00:36:37,803
You were always too easy on him.

736
00:36:37,845 --> 00:36:40,613
Maybe if you pushed him
a little bit harder

737
00:36:40,652 --> 00:36:42,988
he would have amounted
to something.

738
00:36:43,025 --> 00:36:45,189
I doubt it.

739
00:36:45,231 --> 00:36:48,764
When it comes to business,
he's a lot like your father.

740
00:36:50,344 --> 00:36:53,078
You enjoy insulting Father,
don't you?

741
00:36:53,118 --> 00:36:55,647
I'm not insulting anyone.

742
00:36:55,691 --> 00:36:57,628
I'm just being honest.

743
00:36:57,664 --> 00:37:00,536
Rom's a lot like his father.

744
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,043
And you...

745
00:37:05,049 --> 00:37:07,715
I suppose, are a lot like me.

746
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,825
I never knew you felt like that.

747
00:37:11,867 --> 00:37:14,396
Your father
might have bought you

748
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,710
your first copy
of <i>The Rules of Acquisition</i>

749
00:37:17,749 --> 00:37:20,244
but who helped you
memorize them?

750
00:37:20,289 --> 00:37:21,953
You did.

751
00:37:21,993 --> 00:37:25,730
I don't think
I've ever been prouder...

752
00:37:25,769 --> 00:37:30,476
than the first time you made it
through all 285 Rules

753
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:33,785
without a mistake.

754
00:37:33,823 --> 00:37:36,729
Rom knows them
just as well as I do.

755
00:37:36,765 --> 00:37:39,135
But you understand them.

756
00:37:41,811 --> 00:37:43,577
Rom never did.

757
00:37:43,616 --> 00:37:45,644
And neither did his father.

758
00:37:46,924 --> 00:37:50,923
But even if Keldar didn't know
the first thing about profit

759
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:55,572
he knew everything about family.

760
00:37:55,613 --> 00:37:58,678
He was a good husband...

761
00:37:58,722 --> 00:38:01,422
and a wonderful father.

762
00:38:01,463 --> 00:38:03,457
And I loved him for that...

763
00:38:03,501 --> 00:38:06,065
the way I love Rom...

764
00:38:07,144 --> 00:38:09,912
and the way I love you.

765
00:38:11,154 --> 00:38:12,487
You mean that?

766
00:38:13,995 --> 00:38:16,331
Yes, I suppose I do.

767
00:38:18,172 --> 00:38:20,336
If it'll make you happy...

768
00:38:21,515 --> 00:38:23,452
I'll give back the money.

769
00:38:23,486 --> 00:38:25,582
You'll imprint the confession?

770
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:28,154
You're my son, Quark.
How can I refuse you?

771
00:38:28,198 --> 00:38:30,830
You don't know
how much this means to me.

772
00:38:30,871 --> 00:38:34,540
I know exactly
how much this means to you.

773
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,396
Oh, Moogie...

774
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:46,139
I love you.

775
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:06,723
There's no place
like New Orleans

776
00:39:06,765 --> 00:39:09,705
for simple pleasures...
good food, great music.

777
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:12,042
Hmm. Sounds like a
great place to grow up.

778
00:39:12,078 --> 00:39:13,570
The best.

779
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:17,081
Can I get you another <i>raktajino?</i>

780
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:19,757
Uh, no, I'm... fine.

781
00:39:22,907 --> 00:39:24,969
You seem a little preoccupied.

782
00:39:27,619 --> 00:39:30,183
It's just, when we
made our plans

783
00:39:30,226 --> 00:39:33,963
I forgot, uh... I had
a previous engagement.

784
00:39:34,002 --> 00:39:35,836
I see.

785
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,209
Oh, it's not what you think.

786
00:39:38,247 --> 00:39:41,187
It's kind
of a family obligation.

787
00:39:41,221 --> 00:39:43,785
You see, my youngest brother,
he's a colonist on Cestus III.

788
00:39:43,828 --> 00:39:45,958
That's on the other side
of the Federation.

789
00:39:46,001 --> 00:39:47,368
Well, it's so far away

790
00:39:47,437 --> 00:39:49,271
it takes two weeks
for a subspace transmission

791
00:39:49,309 --> 00:39:51,075
to get here,
and I'm expecting one tonight.

792
00:39:51,114 --> 00:39:53,278
I promised my brother
I'd listen to it as it came in.

793
00:39:53,319 --> 00:39:55,587
I hope nothing's wrong.

794
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:57,391
Oh, not unless
he hurt himself again.

795
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:00,495
Last time, he tore some
ligaments in his knee.

796
00:40:00,538 --> 00:40:02,168
How'd that happen?

797
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:03,575
Uh...

798
00:40:03,613 --> 00:40:04,946
he was doing something

799
00:40:04,983 --> 00:40:06,783
called "sliding into second."

800
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,697
S-s...

801
00:40:10,731 --> 00:40:12,759
sliding into second?

802
00:40:12,803 --> 00:40:13,897
Yes.

803
00:40:13,939 --> 00:40:15,739
That sounds like baseball.

804
00:40:15,777 --> 00:40:17,941
You know about baseball?

805
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:20,555
It's my favorite sport.

806
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:23,062
But no one has played it
for 200 years.

807
00:40:23,097 --> 00:40:25,159
Well, they're playing it
on Cestus III.

808
00:40:25,202 --> 00:40:28,233
At least, they have been
for the last six months.

809
00:40:28,276 --> 00:40:29,404
I had no idea.

810
00:40:29,446 --> 00:40:30,813
That's fantastic!

811
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,217
How many teams are there?

812
00:40:32,253 --> 00:40:36,161
Uh, six, but they're trying
to organize a couple more.

813
00:40:36,197 --> 00:40:38,931
I... I didn't know
you liked baseball.

814
00:40:38,971 --> 00:40:42,435
I didn't know anyone else liked
baseball except me and Jake.

815
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:46,988
Uh, look, this transmission
I mentioned

816
00:40:47,025 --> 00:40:49,019
uh, it's an audio recording
of a game

817
00:40:49,063 --> 00:40:52,299
between my brother's team,
the Pike City Pioneers

818
00:40:52,338 --> 00:40:53,807
and the Cestus Comets.

819
00:40:53,843 --> 00:40:56,042
Uh... well, if you'd like

820
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:58,713
you're welcome to listen
to it with me.

821
00:40:58,756 --> 00:40:59,747
Well, I'd...

822
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:00,760
I'd love to.

823
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:01,763
Oh, great.

824
00:41:01,797 --> 00:41:02,766
Well...

825
00:41:02,799 --> 00:41:04,063
Oh...

826
00:41:04,102 --> 00:41:05,594
Tell me, does
your brother's league

827
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,440
use a designated hitter rule?

828
00:41:07,479 --> 00:41:10,247
Oh, no, they thought about it,
but decided against it.

829
00:41:10,285 --> 00:41:12,279
Ah. Wood bats or polyduranide?

830
00:41:12,324 --> 00:41:13,623
Wood, of course.

831
00:41:13,661 --> 00:41:16,760
Do you think your brother could
use a right-handed pitcher?

832
00:41:16,803 --> 00:41:18,272
Oh, no.

833
00:41:33,512 --> 00:41:37,181
Everything seems to be in order.

834
00:41:37,222 --> 00:41:40,424
I'm glad we can finally
put an end to this matter.

835
00:41:40,463 --> 00:41:43,528
I certainly hope you
have learned your lesson.

836
00:41:43,572 --> 00:41:46,101
And what would that be?

837
00:41:48,016 --> 00:41:49,987
She's speaking to me again.

838
00:41:50,022 --> 00:41:51,150
No, she wasn't.

839
00:41:51,191 --> 00:41:53,355
She's speaking to me.

840
00:41:54,867 --> 00:41:57,635
Now, what were you
saying about a lesson?

841
00:41:57,709 --> 00:41:59,646
Ah, the lesson is:

842
00:41:59,714 --> 00:42:02,688
No one can outsmart the FCA.

843
00:42:02,722 --> 00:42:04,420
I think she's
certainly learned that.

844
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:07,457
Your mother's confession
will serve as a warning

845
00:42:07,501 --> 00:42:09,529
to females
all over the Alliance.

846
00:42:09,573 --> 00:42:12,706
Oh, I don't think anyone
has to know about this.

847
00:42:12,748 --> 00:42:15,312
After all, what would people say

848
00:42:15,354 --> 00:42:18,226
if they knew
a female had earned...

849
00:42:18,262 --> 00:42:20,028
that much latinum?

850
00:42:20,067 --> 00:42:22,403
I shudder to think.

851
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:25,441
Good-bye.

852
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:32,391
I sincerely hope I never see
any of you again.

853
00:42:32,432 --> 00:42:34,528
The feeling is mutual.

854
00:42:42,324 --> 00:42:44,420
I thought he'd never leave.

855
00:42:44,464 --> 00:42:47,198
Mother... must you?

856
00:42:47,237 --> 00:42:50,268
Quark, I've just given
up a sizable fortune.

857
00:42:50,312 --> 00:42:52,648
I'm in no mood for your nagging.

858
00:42:52,685 --> 00:42:54,120
You're absolutely right.

859
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:56,423
If you want to wear clothes,
go ahead.

860
00:42:56,461 --> 00:42:57,430
What do I care?

861
00:42:57,463 --> 00:42:58,727
I'm leaving, anyway.

862
00:42:58,834 --> 00:43:00,235
So soon?

863
00:43:00,271 --> 00:43:02,242
I have to reopen the bar.

864
00:43:02,276 --> 00:43:04,680
It's supporting all of us now.

865
00:43:04,716 --> 00:43:06,846
Well, you know, you could
call your mother

866
00:43:06,888 --> 00:43:09,588
every once in a while...
maybe even visit.

867
00:43:12,169 --> 00:43:13,969
I will.

868
00:43:14,007 --> 00:43:15,841
I promise.

869
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:24,158
Let's go, Rom.

870
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,262
I'll be along in a moment,
Brother.

871
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:40,370
I'm glad to see you two
are finally getting along.

872
00:43:40,408 --> 00:43:42,470
Yeah, I think things will be

873
00:43:42,513 --> 00:43:45,213
a lot better
between us from now on.

874
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:47,089
As long as he doesn't find out

875
00:43:47,126 --> 00:43:49,998
you only gave the FCA
a third of your profits.

876
00:43:50,033 --> 00:43:52,505
If you ask me,
a third was too much.

877
00:43:52,539 --> 00:43:55,809
Well, it's my own fault
for not hiding it better.

878
00:43:55,882 --> 00:43:58,354
You sure the FCA
won't find the rest?

879
00:43:58,389 --> 00:44:01,830
I've got it hidden so well,
I'll be lucky if I can find it.

880
00:44:08,748 --> 00:44:11,050
Oh, Moogie...

881
00:44:11,088 --> 00:44:14,552
Now, Rom, don't start crying.
You'll get me doing it.

882
00:44:14,597 --> 00:44:16,363
Go on, go on.

883
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:18,099
Quark's waiting for you.

884
00:44:23,186 --> 00:44:26,126
Take good care of your brother.
