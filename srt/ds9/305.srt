1
00:00:08,878 --> 00:00:12,512
Why don't you tell
your Uncle Quark all about it?

2
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,354
What are you
talking about, Quark?

3
00:00:14,392 --> 00:00:15,417
You're 15 minutes late

4
00:00:15,461 --> 00:00:17,192
for your appointment
in the holosuites

5
00:00:17,265 --> 00:00:18,393
and, by the look
of that drink

6
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,870
you've been nursing
it for a while.

7
00:00:19,905 --> 00:00:22,206
You got stood up, didn't you?

8
00:00:22,244 --> 00:00:26,346
Well, if you must know,
I'm waiting for Major Kira.

9
00:00:26,387 --> 00:00:28,221
We're supposed to go
antigrav sailing together

10
00:00:28,325 --> 00:00:30,228
but you know how she feels
about the holosuites.

11
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:32,929
She feels they're
a complete waste of time.

12
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:34,438
Anything worth doing
in a holosuite

13
00:00:34,473 --> 00:00:36,067
can be done better
in the real world.

14
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,744
You obviously haven't been
in the right holosuite program.

15
00:00:39,786 --> 00:00:42,588
But, if you'd like, I could...

16
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:43,594
You could

17
00:00:43,628 --> 00:00:45,291
but you'd live to regret it.

18
00:00:47,204 --> 00:00:48,696
Maybe some other time.

19
00:00:50,712 --> 00:00:52,045
I'm sorry I'm late.

20
00:00:52,082 --> 00:00:54,816
Sisko and I had to revise
crew rotations again.

21
00:00:54,856 --> 00:00:55,984
So you're not canceling?

22
00:00:56,024 --> 00:00:57,118
No!

23
00:00:57,161 --> 00:00:59,496
I'm... kind of looking
forward to it

24
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:00,934
except for crashing.

25
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,168
Well, don't worry,
you won't crash.

26
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,772
We'll start out
with an easy simulation

27
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:09,586
like... sailing across
the Great Erg on New Mecca.

28
00:01:09,624 --> 00:01:10,683
You'll see.

29
00:01:10,727 --> 00:01:12,219
It'll be great.

30
00:01:12,264 --> 00:01:13,631
Ops to Major Kira.

31
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:14,761
Kira here.

32
00:01:14,803 --> 00:01:16,740
You have an incoming
communication

33
00:01:16,774 --> 00:01:18,745
from the Bajoran
Central Archives.

34
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:20,271
I'm in the Replimat.

35
00:01:20,316 --> 00:01:21,410
I'll take it down here.

36
00:01:21,452 --> 00:01:23,252
This will only take a minute.

37
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,826
This is Major Kira.

38
00:01:25,863 --> 00:01:26,831
Major.

39
00:01:26,865 --> 00:01:28,266
My name is Alenis Grem.

40
00:01:28,302 --> 00:01:31,139
I'm doing a study on
the Elemspur Detention Center

41
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:32,804
for the Bajoran Central Archives

42
00:01:32,846 --> 00:01:36,811
and, um, I was hoping to ask you
a few questions.

43
00:01:36,855 --> 00:01:39,292
I'd be glad to help,
but why come to me?

44
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:40,855
I was never at Elemspur.

45
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:43,531
Cardassian records
clearly indicate

46
00:01:43,572 --> 00:01:46,568
that a Kira Nerys
was held at Elemspur

47
00:01:46,613 --> 00:01:48,276
for, uh... seven days.

48
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,979
You've got the wrong Kira Nerys.

49
00:01:50,021 --> 00:01:51,115
Believe me.

50
00:01:51,156 --> 00:01:53,958
If I'd been held in a
Cardassian prison, I'd remember.

51
00:01:53,997 --> 00:01:55,364
I don't understand.

52
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,598
I, I have the records
right here.

53
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:59,837
Kira Nerys of Dahkur Province

54
00:01:59,878 --> 00:02:02,749
a member of the Shakaar
resistance cell.

55
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,021
You see?

56
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:10,734
It's you.

57
00:04:17,643 --> 00:04:20,673
If your memory and these
prison records don't agree

58
00:04:20,717 --> 00:04:22,654
then one of them
must be wrong...

59
00:04:22,688 --> 00:04:24,248
either the records, or...

60
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:27,060
My memory is fine.

61
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:30,231
I know exactly
where I was that week.

62
00:04:30,273 --> 00:04:31,263
After ten years?

63
00:04:31,309 --> 00:04:32,869
I spent the entire winter

64
00:04:32,913 --> 00:04:35,384
with my resistance group
in the Dahkur Hills.

65
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:38,517
We had no power cells for
our phasers, very little food

66
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:40,621
and we spent
most of our time in caves

67
00:04:40,664 --> 00:04:42,965
hiding from
the Cardassian sensor sweeps.

68
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:45,407
Believe me,
it was very memorable.

69
00:04:45,443 --> 00:04:47,140
These records are fake.

70
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:52,649
The only question is
who faked them and why.

71
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:56,429
According to this,
you supposedly shared a cell

72
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:58,497
with three other inmates.

73
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,571
Maybe one of them
can help us find out

74
00:05:01,615 --> 00:05:03,346
what's going on here.

75
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:05,988
Elemspur...

76
00:05:06,092 --> 00:05:08,997
I haven't thought about
that place for a long time.

77
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:11,161
I was hoping you could answer
some questions

78
00:05:11,205 --> 00:05:12,572
about your fellow prisoners.

79
00:05:12,608 --> 00:05:15,206
I'll try...

80
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,151
Now, wait...

81
00:05:17,185 --> 00:05:19,622
I remember you.

82
00:05:19,658 --> 00:05:21,822
You were there, too,
weren't you?

83
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:23,026
Kiri something.

84
00:05:25,172 --> 00:05:26,972
Kira.

85
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:28,205
Kira Nerys.

86
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:30,274
Yeah, I almost didn't
recognize you.

87
00:05:30,317 --> 00:05:33,621
You used to wear your hair
differently, didn't you?

88
00:05:33,658 --> 00:05:34,820
Uh... longer?

89
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:39,197
You remember me...

90
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,764
after all this time.

91
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:41,416
When the Cardassians

92
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,580
dragged you out of our cell,
I gave you up for dead.

93
00:05:44,624 --> 00:05:47,688
Glad to see I was wrong.

94
00:05:47,731 --> 00:05:51,833
Those were bad times.

95
00:05:53,245 --> 00:05:54,805
Yes, they were.

96
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:01,620
He could have been lying.

97
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:04,638
Maybe, but the records
and the only surviving witness

98
00:06:04,672 --> 00:06:06,232
both say I was at Elemspur.

99
00:06:06,276 --> 00:06:08,304
My memory
says something different.

100
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:10,044
I got to find out the truth.

101
00:06:10,084 --> 00:06:11,348
I understand.

102
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:13,757
If there's anything you need...

103
00:06:13,794 --> 00:06:15,161
I'll let you know.

104
00:06:15,197 --> 00:06:16,791
This shouldn't take long.

105
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,271
I should only be
on Bajor a few days.

106
00:06:19,307 --> 00:06:22,975
We'll try to manage without you
until you get back.

107
00:06:42,663 --> 00:06:43,631
There you are, Garak.

108
00:06:43,665 --> 00:06:44,633
Ah.

109
00:06:44,668 --> 00:06:47,232
I went past your shop,
but it was closed.

110
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,642
Well, unfortunately,
business has been a bit slow.

111
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,808
I mean, for some reason

112
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:53,184
living under the constant
threat of Dominion attack

113
00:06:53,222 --> 00:06:57,187
has made people less eager
to invest in new clothing.

114
00:06:57,231 --> 00:06:59,634
So how was your trip
to Klaestron IV?

115
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,969
Oh, terrific.

116
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:04,778
The Klaestrons have developed
a new burn treatment technology

117
00:07:04,816 --> 00:07:06,912
which has to be seen
to be believed.

118
00:07:06,954 --> 00:07:08,423
You know, I envy you.

119
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:09,483
How so?

120
00:07:09,527 --> 00:07:10,791
When I was younger

121
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,233
traveling was a bit
of a passion for me.

122
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,741
There are few things in life
that compare

123
00:07:15,775 --> 00:07:17,973
with the thrill
of immersing yourself

124
00:07:18,014 --> 00:07:19,985
in the culture of an alien world

125
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:22,719
meeting the inhabitants,
earning their trust.

126
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:25,357
But, aside from our
brief excursion to Bajor

127
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,802
I don't think I've been
off this station

128
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:29,205
in nearly three years.

129
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:30,505
Well, what's stopping you?

130
00:07:30,544 --> 00:07:33,381
Ships are leaving Deep Space 9
almost every day.

131
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:35,446
Space is dangerous, Doctor.

132
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,961
You never know
what might happen.

133
00:07:37,995 --> 00:07:40,991
Garak, you're being paranoid.

134
00:07:41,036 --> 00:07:42,836
Are you saying

135
00:07:42,874 --> 00:07:45,141
the Cardassian government
would have you killed

136
00:07:45,179 --> 00:07:46,409
if you left this station?

137
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:51,827
My dear doctor, you do have
a vivid imagination.

138
00:07:54,736 --> 00:07:57,334
Commander, we're receiving
a transmission

139
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,243
from Bajoran Central Archives.

140
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,647
I'll take it.

141
00:08:05,093 --> 00:08:06,893
If you're looking
for Major Kira, I'm afraid

142
00:08:06,932 --> 00:08:08,401
she's not on the station
right now.

143
00:08:08,435 --> 00:08:09,425
She's on Bajor.

144
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,907
I know.
That's why I called.

145
00:08:11,944 --> 00:08:14,438
The Major contacted me
before she left.

146
00:08:14,482 --> 00:08:17,216
She was supposed to meet with me
so I could show her

147
00:08:17,256 --> 00:08:19,591
the information
I'd retrieved from Elemspur.

148
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:20,825
She never came.

149
00:08:20,864 --> 00:08:23,393
I tried to contact
the Major to reschedule

150
00:08:23,438 --> 00:08:25,272
but she wasn't
where she said she'd be.

151
00:08:25,308 --> 00:08:28,042
As far as I can tell,
no one's seen her

152
00:08:28,082 --> 00:08:31,112
since she left the spaceport
for Elemspur.

153
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,664
Wake her.

154
00:08:43,987 --> 00:08:45,422
Where am I?

155
00:08:45,457 --> 00:08:47,826
It's all right.
You're safe.

156
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:10,073
What have you done to me?

157
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:13,488
We've brought you back home.

158
00:09:13,524 --> 00:09:15,187
To Cardassia.

159
00:09:32,402 --> 00:09:33,632
Please...

160
00:09:33,672 --> 00:09:35,266
we're here to help you.

161
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:38,545
I don't know who you are
or what you're trying to do

162
00:09:38,584 --> 00:09:39,712
but it won't work.

163
00:09:39,821 --> 00:09:42,385
Whatever you think this
is going to get you

164
00:09:42,426 --> 00:09:43,554
you can forget it.

165
00:09:43,596 --> 00:09:46,330
We don't think it's going
to get us anything.

166
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,067
If all we wanted was information

167
00:09:48,107 --> 00:09:49,201
we'd have it already.

168
00:09:49,243 --> 00:09:51,510
Oh, well, then
what's stopping you?

169
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,577
We have no intention
of hurting you.

170
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,716
Why should we?
You're one of us.

171
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,749
This is absurd.

172
00:09:56,794 --> 00:09:59,699
You can mutilate me,
change my appearance.

173
00:09:59,734 --> 00:10:02,035
You are never going
to convince me

174
00:10:02,074 --> 00:10:03,668
that I am a Cardassian.

175
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:05,773
I know this is difficult
for you.

176
00:10:05,816 --> 00:10:06,784
I'm sorry.

177
00:10:06,852 --> 00:10:08,549
I wish there were a better way
to prepare you

178
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,820
for what you're going through.

179
00:10:11,062 --> 00:10:16,132
Sometimes I question the wisdom
of our infiltration methods.

180
00:10:16,174 --> 00:10:19,637
By altering the memories
of our long-term operatives

181
00:10:19,682 --> 00:10:22,678
we ensure that they'll
never be discovered

182
00:10:22,724 --> 00:10:26,028
but it makes reintegrating them
back into Cardassian society

183
00:10:26,064 --> 00:10:27,192
much more difficult.

184
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,334
Still, it's hard to argue
with success.

185
00:10:31,378 --> 00:10:33,542
You really expect me
to believe all of this?

186
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,952
Oh, of course not.

187
00:10:37,058 --> 00:10:38,721
At least, not yet.

188
00:10:38,762 --> 00:10:42,829
We've given you medication
to reverse your memory loss

189
00:10:42,872 --> 00:10:46,313
but it can take some time
to become effective.

190
00:10:46,347 --> 00:10:49,047
Until your original
memory reemerges

191
00:10:49,086 --> 00:10:52,583
I don't expect you
to believe a word I say.

192
00:10:52,628 --> 00:10:55,192
But it still can be difficult

193
00:10:55,234 --> 00:10:57,501
watching someone
you care about suffer.

194
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,812
Oh. So I suppose you and I
are old friends.

195
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,513
I supervised your training.

196
00:11:03,555 --> 00:11:05,617
Ah...

197
00:11:06,762 --> 00:11:09,233
You are an undercover operative

198
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:12,606
of the Obsidian Order
named Iliana Ghemor.

199
00:11:12,642 --> 00:11:14,875
Ten years ago, you volunteered

200
00:11:14,982 --> 00:11:17,453
for an undercover assignment
on Bajor.

201
00:11:17,488 --> 00:11:19,584
We kidnapped a Bajoran terrorist

202
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:22,063
gave you her memories,
her appearance

203
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:26,098
and placed you back on Bajor
to infiltrate the resistance.

204
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:30,041
I know.

205
00:11:30,085 --> 00:11:31,816
You don't believe me.

206
00:11:31,855 --> 00:11:33,518
But you'll remember.

207
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,963
It will just take some time.

208
00:11:37,135 --> 00:11:39,869
See?
Being here should help.

209
00:11:41,412 --> 00:11:42,938
This place?

210
00:11:43,016 --> 00:11:45,955
It's just another
Cardassian prison.

211
00:11:46,056 --> 00:11:48,391
This is not a prison, Iliana.

212
00:11:48,428 --> 00:11:52,495
This is your room in the house
where you were born.

213
00:11:52,538 --> 00:11:53,973
Your home.

214
00:11:54,042 --> 00:11:58,314
My home is in
the Dahkur Province of Bajor.

215
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:04,095
Here. This contains a personal
statement you recorded

216
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:06,434
before you were sent to Bajor.

217
00:12:06,472 --> 00:12:07,771
Watch it.

218
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:10,748
It should help explain things.

219
00:12:17,732 --> 00:12:20,637
If you have any questions,
just ask.

220
00:12:29,547 --> 00:12:31,347
We've interviewed
all the residents

221
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,982
in the vicinity of the
Elemspur Detention Center.

222
00:12:34,024 --> 00:12:36,427
One of them
thinks he saw Kira

223
00:12:36,531 --> 00:12:39,368
walking up the old Cardassian
road toward the Center.

224
00:12:39,404 --> 00:12:42,070
When we scanned the area,
we found a residual

225
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,944
electrostatic charge.

226
00:12:43,982 --> 00:12:46,614
This could be
a transporter trace.

227
00:12:46,655 --> 00:12:49,651
Do you think
she was beamed away?

228
00:12:51,867 --> 00:12:54,999
All right, I want to know
the name of every ship

229
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:57,275
that was in the area
at the time of the beam-out.

230
00:12:57,314 --> 00:13:00,310
Constable, contact your friends
in the Bajoran militia.

231
00:13:00,354 --> 00:13:02,222
Tell them we need to see
the activity logs

232
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:05,027
of all the ground-based
transporters in the area.

233
00:13:05,066 --> 00:13:07,094
That'll be all.

234
00:13:07,137 --> 00:13:11,979
Benjamin, those residual
electrostatic charges...

235
00:13:12,015 --> 00:13:15,456
they could also have been left
by a disrupter or a phaser

236
00:13:15,557 --> 00:13:17,254
set to kill.

237
00:13:17,295 --> 00:13:18,525
I know.

238
00:13:19,734 --> 00:13:21,465
...to the children.

239
00:13:21,505 --> 00:13:25,344
They are the future
of Cardassia, and they...

240
00:13:52,981 --> 00:13:54,245
Enter!

241
00:13:55,854 --> 00:14:00,422
Ah. There's someone here
who wants to see you.

242
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,196
You took your time about it,
Entek.

243
00:14:02,235 --> 00:14:05,037
I don't appreciate being
kept waiting in my own house.

244
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:06,169
As I explained, Legate

245
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,308
the initial debriefings
can be difficult.

246
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,683
We couldn't allow
any interruptions.

247
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,710
Ah!

248
00:14:21,081 --> 00:14:23,109
It really is you.

249
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,121
Remember

250
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,592
her memory hasn't returned yet.

251
00:14:27,597 --> 00:14:29,659
I understand.

252
00:14:31,472 --> 00:14:33,135
Iliana, I...

253
00:14:33,177 --> 00:14:37,381
I wish I could tell you
how much this means to me.

254
00:14:39,191 --> 00:14:41,253
Am I supposed to know you?

255
00:14:41,296 --> 00:14:44,702
Iliana, this is
Legate Tekeny Ghemor.

256
00:14:44,738 --> 00:14:46,367
He's your father.

257
00:14:46,408 --> 00:14:49,438
My father?

258
00:14:51,721 --> 00:14:56,027
My father died on Bajor
fighting Cardassians.

259
00:14:56,065 --> 00:14:57,193
That's not true.

260
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,403
I'm sorry.

261
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:04,110
I know you don't remember me

262
00:15:04,151 --> 00:15:07,056
but I've been waiting
for this for so long.

263
00:15:08,862 --> 00:15:10,354
Please, leave us.

264
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,395
Are you sure that's wise?

265
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,137
She's my daughter.

266
00:15:15,177 --> 00:15:17,775
She's not going to hurt me.

267
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:19,377
As you wish.

268
00:15:26,004 --> 00:15:27,975
I've missed you, Iliana.

269
00:15:28,008 --> 00:15:30,810
Don't call me that.

270
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,663
It's not my name.

271
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:40,865
And I am not your daughter.

272
00:15:40,905 --> 00:15:43,001
I should let you rest.

273
00:15:44,782 --> 00:15:47,778
You will remember, in time.

274
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,693
Until then, please,
consider yourself

275
00:15:50,796 --> 00:15:52,630
a guest in this house.

276
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:31,055
Oh, good evening, Doctor.

277
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:32,619
If you're finished here

278
00:16:32,663 --> 00:16:36,502
I was wondering if you'd like
to join me for a late snack.

279
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:39,569
Um, actually, all I want
right now is a little sleep.

280
00:16:39,613 --> 00:16:40,581
Maybe tomorrow.

281
00:16:40,615 --> 00:16:42,449
I'm afraid this can't
wait until tomorrow.

282
00:16:42,487 --> 00:16:46,087
I have very important
news about Major Kira.

283
00:16:55,451 --> 00:16:58,117
In the left corner,
above the window.

284
00:17:01,632 --> 00:17:02,726
What?

285
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:05,136
The Obsidian Order
surveillance devices.

286
00:17:05,174 --> 00:17:07,908
That is what you're looking for,
isn't it?

287
00:17:07,947 --> 00:17:09,747
Don't worry.
They're not on.

288
00:17:09,785 --> 00:17:11,482
I'm a member
of the Central Command.

289
00:17:11,522 --> 00:17:14,154
They're only activated
at my request.

290
00:17:14,196 --> 00:17:16,964
I thought you might
want some breakfast.

291
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:20,739
I assumed you'd be used
to Bajoran food by now

292
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:23,910
so I took the liberty
of replicating some <i>hasperat.</i>

293
00:17:23,952 --> 00:17:25,251
I'm not hungry.

294
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,603
You recognize that?

295
00:17:31,637 --> 00:17:34,040
It's the bone carving
you made for me

296
00:17:34,077 --> 00:17:36,514
when I was promoted to Legate.

297
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:39,454
Your daughter was talented.

298
00:17:42,096 --> 00:17:44,090
Yes.

299
00:17:44,134 --> 00:17:46,002
She is.

300
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:48,977
I always thought you
should have been an artist...

301
00:17:49,013 --> 00:17:51,507
you have such a wonderful
eye for detail...

302
00:17:51,552 --> 00:17:54,150
but you were determined
to join the Order.

303
00:17:54,192 --> 00:17:58,065
You thought it was your duty
to Cardassia.

304
00:17:58,101 --> 00:18:02,407
Personally, I think Cardassia
could use a few more artists.

305
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,681
Are you sure you won't try
some <i>hasperat?</i>

306
00:18:07,724 --> 00:18:10,127
It's only good when it's warm.

307
00:18:10,163 --> 00:18:11,222
No.

308
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:13,360
Thank you.

309
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,269
You're as stubborn
as your mother.

310
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:26,163
She could never do anything
the easy way.

311
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:30,304
You don't remember
her, either, do you?

312
00:18:30,344 --> 00:18:37,054
My mother was an icon painter
from Dahkur Province.

313
00:18:37,094 --> 00:18:41,537
She died of malnutrition
at the Singha refugee camp

314
00:18:41,572 --> 00:18:42,905
when I was three.

315
00:18:43,008 --> 00:18:46,950
Your mother was an Inquisitor
at the Central University.

316
00:18:48,622 --> 00:18:50,353
This is my fault.

317
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:54,625
I never should have let
you go on that mission.

318
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:56,298
I could have prevented it.

319
00:18:56,341 --> 00:18:59,645
A well-placed word here,
a favor from a friend there.

320
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:02,050
You never would have known.

321
00:19:02,088 --> 00:19:05,551
But... you were
so determined to go

322
00:19:05,596 --> 00:19:07,897
so proud
that you'd been chosen

323
00:19:08,002 --> 00:19:11,203
that I didn't have
the heart to stop you.

324
00:19:12,412 --> 00:19:14,406
Your mother never forgave me.

325
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,385
You're good.

326
00:19:18,427 --> 00:19:21,059
Really good.

327
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:24,197
The house, the food,
the stories...

328
00:19:24,241 --> 00:19:26,644
it's all very convincing.

329
00:19:27,849 --> 00:19:30,754
But I don't believe
a word of it.

330
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:37,600
Iliana, I just want you
to know... I'm sorry.

331
00:19:45,676 --> 00:19:46,872
Commander, I've already

332
00:19:46,912 --> 00:19:48,940
told the good doctor
everything I know.

333
00:19:48,983 --> 00:19:51,284
I'd like to hear it
again firsthand.

334
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,519
This is pointless.

335
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,961
Believe me, there's
nothing you can do.

336
00:19:54,998 --> 00:19:56,467
If my friend is correct

337
00:19:56,502 --> 00:19:59,669
and Major Kira is being
held by the Obsidian Order

338
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:01,942
retrieving her
would be impossible.

339
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:06,151
Impossible for us maybe,
but not for you.

340
00:20:06,191 --> 00:20:07,888
I'm afraid you overestimate
my abilities.

341
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:09,991
I hope not,
because I intend to put

342
00:20:10,034 --> 00:20:11,560
your abilities to the test.

343
00:20:11,604 --> 00:20:13,905
The three of us
are going to Cardassia.

344
00:20:13,943 --> 00:20:15,173
The three of us?

345
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,883
You can't be serious.

346
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,518
Commander, if I were allowed
on Cardassia

347
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,030
do you really think
I'd be living here?

348
00:20:23,065 --> 00:20:25,434
Which brings up
an interesting point.

349
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,601
There are certain ministers
in the Bajoran government

350
00:20:27,642 --> 00:20:29,111
who are concerned
about your presence

351
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:30,114
on this station.

352
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:31,880
In fact,
they want you removed.

353
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,884
Right now, I see no alternative
but to honor their request.

354
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:38,196
Unless, of course,
I can show them

355
00:20:38,235 --> 00:20:40,433
how you might be valuable to us.

356
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:42,876
Rescuing Kira would
go a long way

357
00:20:42,913 --> 00:20:46,080
toward improving your standing
with the Bajoran government.

358
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,458
Why should I care what the
Bajoran government thinks of me?

359
00:20:49,495 --> 00:20:51,625
I don't know, but it seems to me

360
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:55,609
if someone were in trouble with
the Cardassian Central Command

361
00:20:55,643 --> 00:20:58,707
a Bajoran space station
under Federation control

362
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,622
might just be the safest place
in the galaxy.

363
00:21:01,658 --> 00:21:05,121
Commander, this is extortion.

364
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,863
Mmm.

365
00:21:08,273 --> 00:21:09,640
Yes, it is.

366
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,186
We'll be traveling
under false transit documents

367
00:21:14,221 --> 00:21:15,986
prepared by Starfleet
Intelligence.

368
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,392
Mr. O'Brien has reconfigured

369
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:19,160
the shield harmonics
of the <i>Defiant</i>

370
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:21,693
so that, on long-range
sensors, we'll appear to be

371
00:21:21,806 --> 00:21:23,400
a Kobheerian freighter.

372
00:21:25,248 --> 00:21:27,846
We leave in three hours.

373
00:21:27,888 --> 00:21:30,884
I'll go along
on your fool's errand

374
00:21:30,928 --> 00:21:34,369
but I want one thing
to be perfectly clear:

375
00:21:34,403 --> 00:21:35,393
I have no intention

376
00:21:35,438 --> 00:21:37,432
of sacrificing my life
to save yours.

377
00:21:37,477 --> 00:21:39,971
If it looks like we're
in danger of being captured

378
00:21:40,016 --> 00:21:41,884
if there's any sign
of trouble at all

379
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:43,550
you're on your own.

380
00:21:43,591 --> 00:21:45,562
Mr. Garak, I believe

381
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,499
that's the first
completely honest thing

382
00:21:47,534 --> 00:21:48,696
you've ever said to me.

383
00:21:49,706 --> 00:21:52,270
How perceptive of you,
Commander.

384
00:21:57,258 --> 00:21:59,729
She doesn't remember anything?

385
00:21:59,763 --> 00:22:01,392
Not yet.

386
00:22:01,434 --> 00:22:03,428
That's unfortunate.

387
00:22:03,472 --> 00:22:06,240
It would have made
things easier.

388
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:08,648
I'm afraid I'm going

389
00:22:08,685 --> 00:22:10,918
to have to ask you
some questions.

390
00:22:10,957 --> 00:22:12,085
So soon?

391
00:22:12,126 --> 00:22:15,258
I thought she'd be given time
to regain her memory.

392
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:16,770
She was given time.

393
00:22:16,838 --> 00:22:20,609
The desegranine injections
should have worked by now.

394
00:22:20,647 --> 00:22:22,618
Memories usually
begin to resurface

395
00:22:22,652 --> 00:22:24,019
after only a few hours.

396
00:22:24,055 --> 00:22:26,151
It's been two days.

397
00:22:27,497 --> 00:22:30,061
And what if the injections
never work?

398
00:22:33,511 --> 00:22:38,147
Your daughter has
some information that we need.

399
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:41,755
I'm sure, in time, she'll see
the wisdom of cooperating.

400
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:45,361
So...

401
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:46,875
if you'll excuse us.

402
00:22:49,883 --> 00:22:52,856
I'll be in the next room
if you need me.

403
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,986
Legate, your concerns
are baseless.

404
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:56,760
She's one of our own people.

405
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,794
We have no reason to harm her.

406
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:01,744
And I'll be nearby
to remind you of that...

407
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:03,647
in case you forget.

408
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:06,177
As you wish, Legate.

409
00:23:11,703 --> 00:23:16,169
What were your duties as First
Officer of Deep Space 9?

410
00:23:16,213 --> 00:23:19,345
I told you, the Federation
runs the station.

411
00:23:19,387 --> 00:23:21,688
I wasn't even allowed into Ops.

412
00:23:21,727 --> 00:23:27,105
How many Starfleet personnel
are stationed on Deep Space 9?

413
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,076
Hmm, 30... 40,000.

414
00:23:29,111 --> 00:23:32,050
Don't tell them I told you.

415
00:23:32,084 --> 00:23:33,678
That's enough!

416
00:23:33,721 --> 00:23:34,985
Iliana...

417
00:23:36,996 --> 00:23:38,522
Oh.

418
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:43,370
Don't you understand
what's going on here?

419
00:23:43,412 --> 00:23:46,249
I'm trying to give you a chance.

420
00:23:46,285 --> 00:23:48,722
Even if you don't
remember who I am

421
00:23:48,757 --> 00:23:51,286
you are still
one of my operatives.

422
00:23:51,331 --> 00:23:55,671
Now, I don't want to hurt you,
but if you don't cooperate...

423
00:23:58,581 --> 00:24:01,554
Maybe there is a way
to convince you

424
00:24:01,588 --> 00:24:04,059
to take what I say seriously.

425
00:24:04,095 --> 00:24:05,394
This is Entek.

426
00:24:05,431 --> 00:24:09,840
Send me exhibit S1983I
immediately.

427
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:10,865
Yes, sir.

428
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:20,130
Nothing you can show me
will make any difference.

429
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:23,298
Did you know
that the Obsidian Order

430
00:24:23,341 --> 00:24:27,613
saves everything that comes
into its possession?

431
00:24:27,651 --> 00:24:30,624
You never know
what might prove useful.

432
00:24:30,658 --> 00:24:33,358
We have libraries
of data transcripts

433
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:35,962
vaults of ancient artifacts,
even...

434
00:24:36,005 --> 00:24:38,203
Ah! Here it is.

435
00:24:39,346 --> 00:24:42,513
Even cryogenic chambers
containing biological subjects

436
00:24:42,554 --> 00:24:43,750
like this one here.

437
00:24:47,699 --> 00:24:49,499
That's impossible.

438
00:24:49,536 --> 00:24:53,603
I assure you, when it comes
to the Obsidian Order

439
00:24:53,647 --> 00:24:56,141
nothing is impossible.

440
00:25:04,005 --> 00:25:05,976
It's a fake.

441
00:25:06,044 --> 00:25:09,849
A clone, a hologram.

442
00:25:09,886 --> 00:25:11,914
For all I know, this whole
place is a holosuite.

443
00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:17,994
Do you remember when you were
on long-range reconnaissance

444
00:25:18,072 --> 00:25:20,009
in the Bestri Woods?

445
00:25:20,043 --> 00:25:21,740
You thought you saw
a Cardassian soldier

446
00:25:21,781 --> 00:25:22,806
and opened fire on him.

447
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,581
You hit your target,
only to find out...

448
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,146
I killed a <i>hara</i> cat.

449
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:29,724
Ah. A mother <i>hara</i> cat
who was nursing her young.

450
00:25:32,005 --> 00:25:34,067
How do you know that?

451
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,979
I never told anyone that story.

452
00:25:39,089 --> 00:25:42,187
I know about it,
because we placed that story

453
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,961
in your memories, Iliana

454
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,974
just like we gave you
every other memory you have.

455
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,537
What we couldn't extract
from the real Kira

456
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,884
we got from other prisoners
or just... invented ourselves.

457
00:25:52,922 --> 00:25:57,092
Ask yourself two things, Iliana.

458
00:25:57,199 --> 00:26:01,539
First, is there anything
that I've said we've done

459
00:26:01,576 --> 00:26:04,572
that's beyond the capabilities
of the Obsidian Order?

460
00:26:04,616 --> 00:26:07,920
I assume you know there isn't.

461
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:09,291
Second...

462
00:26:09,328 --> 00:26:11,458
if you're not my operative

463
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,903
if you're not
who I say you are

464
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:16,537
why would I be
playing this game?

465
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:17,569
Believe me...

466
00:26:17,615 --> 00:26:21,351
if I wanted to extract
the information from you

467
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:23,019
I'd have it already.

468
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:25,362
I don't want to do that.

469
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:27,836
I care about you.

470
00:26:30,044 --> 00:26:33,712
And you were one
of my best students.

471
00:26:35,858 --> 00:26:38,922
Watch the recording,
think about what I've said

472
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:41,631
because the Order
won't wait much longer.

473
00:26:59,849 --> 00:27:01,820
I see you haven't forgotten

474
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,983
all of your Obsidian Order
training.

475
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:08,385
Actually, I learned that
in the resistance.

476
00:27:08,518 --> 00:27:11,047
Next time, you might want to
leave a contact wire running

477
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:13,152
between the wall
and the access plate.

478
00:27:13,196 --> 00:27:16,192
You tripped the silent alarm
when you separated them.

479
00:27:16,237 --> 00:27:18,140
I'll keep that in mind.

480
00:27:18,174 --> 00:27:21,774
I suppose if I walk out of here,
you'll try to stop me.

481
00:27:21,816 --> 00:27:23,308
I don't have to.

482
00:27:23,353 --> 00:27:25,118
You wouldn't get
half a kilometer

483
00:27:25,158 --> 00:27:27,652
without being detected
by the Obsidian Order.

484
00:27:27,698 --> 00:27:30,432
Maybe I'm willing
to take that chance.

485
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,939
Iliana...

486
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:33,670
Stop calling me that.

487
00:27:33,712 --> 00:27:37,346
I am not your daughter,
and I never was.

488
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,493
I'm leaving.

489
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,558
You'll never get off Cardassia.

490
00:27:43,602 --> 00:27:47,202
In the end, you'll only make
things worse for yourself.

491
00:27:47,244 --> 00:27:49,215
I can only do so much
to help you.

492
00:27:49,249 --> 00:27:52,985
If you want to help me,
get me off this planet.

493
00:27:53,058 --> 00:27:54,721
I will never cooperate
with the Order.

494
00:27:54,762 --> 00:27:56,630
Eventually, they're going
to realize that.

495
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:59,903
They will interrogate me,
and I won't survive.

496
00:27:59,941 --> 00:28:02,037
I promise you
that will never happen.

497
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,483
I'll never allow the Order
to harm you.

498
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:07,789
No matter what you decide,
I won't let them hurt you.

499
00:28:07,827 --> 00:28:10,664
I only ask one thing.

500
00:28:10,701 --> 00:28:13,674
Before you make your decision,
I beg you

501
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:15,736
watch the recording
Entek gave you.

502
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:19,550
It's the only way you'll
ever really know the truth.

503
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:40,233
Begin playback.

504
00:28:40,271 --> 00:28:41,604
Hello, Iliana.

505
00:28:41,641 --> 00:28:43,406
Welcome home.

506
00:28:43,445 --> 00:28:48,857
I've been asked to make these
recordings for myself, for you

507
00:28:48,892 --> 00:28:51,797
to help my memory recover
when I get back.

508
00:28:51,832 --> 00:28:53,826
I go in for surgery tomorrow.

509
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,601
I'm going to miss Cardassia

510
00:28:55,642 --> 00:28:57,442
but I know
what I'm doing is right.

511
00:28:57,479 --> 00:29:01,045
The terrorism on Bajor
has to be stopped.

512
00:29:01,087 --> 00:29:04,254
Father doesn't want me to go.

513
00:29:04,296 --> 00:29:08,466
Mother... just looks unhappy
all the time.

514
00:29:08,505 --> 00:29:11,741
I hope someday they understand.

515
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:15,482
I want them to be proud of me.

516
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,071
How are the modifications

517
00:29:23,174 --> 00:29:25,270
to the shield harmonics
holding up?

518
00:29:25,312 --> 00:29:26,302
So far, so good.

519
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:28,079
Nobody here but us Kobheerians.

520
00:29:28,152 --> 00:29:30,214
We're well into Cardassian space

521
00:29:30,258 --> 00:29:32,525
so keep a close eye
on that shield modulator.

522
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:36,299
If it breaks down, we could be
in for some unwelcome company.

523
00:29:36,338 --> 00:29:37,705
Commander, I just caught Garak

524
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:39,109
snooping around
the access corridor

525
00:29:39,145 --> 00:29:40,307
outside the main phaser banks.

526
00:29:40,348 --> 00:29:42,512
I was merely taking a stroll
to stretch my legs.

527
00:29:42,554 --> 00:29:46,325
The quarters on this "vessel"
are rather claustrophobic.

528
00:29:46,362 --> 00:29:48,127
Confine him to his cabin
for the rest of the trip

529
00:29:48,167 --> 00:29:50,331
and post a guard at the door.

530
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,137
Commander, I must protest.

531
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,147
You can protest all you like...

532
00:29:54,214 --> 00:29:56,515
Benjamin, I'm detecting
two Galor-class warships

533
00:29:56,554 --> 00:29:57,853
headed this way.

534
00:29:57,891 --> 00:29:58,985
What about the shield harmonics?

535
00:29:59,026 --> 00:29:59,994
Still holding.

536
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:01,430
As far as their scanners
are concerned

537
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,334
we should still look like
a Kobheerian freighter.

538
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:06,776
It's probably just
a routine security check.

539
00:30:06,812 --> 00:30:08,076
They're hailing us.

540
00:30:08,115 --> 00:30:09,140
Drop out of warp.

541
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:11,018
I don't want
to get too close to them.

542
00:30:11,055 --> 00:30:13,549
Is the communications
holo-filter ready?

543
00:30:13,594 --> 00:30:15,428
I can make your com image

544
00:30:15,466 --> 00:30:17,562
look like 3,000-ton
screech rhino

545
00:30:17,604 --> 00:30:18,903
if you want me to.

546
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:21,812
A Kobheerian captain
will do nicely, Lieutenant.

547
00:30:21,848 --> 00:30:23,044
Engage the overlay.

548
00:30:23,084 --> 00:30:24,576
Put them on screen.

549
00:30:24,621 --> 00:30:26,819
This is Gul Benil
of the Eighth Order.

550
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,420
Identify yourself.

551
00:30:28,463 --> 00:30:30,593
This is the Kobheerian
Freighter <i>Rak-Minunis.</i>

552
00:30:30,635 --> 00:30:32,731
I'm Captain Viterian.
How can I help you?

553
00:30:32,774 --> 00:30:34,471
What is your destination?

554
00:30:34,512 --> 00:30:35,811
Cardassia Prime.

555
00:30:35,848 --> 00:30:38,115
We're carrying a shipment
of Kobheerian toranium

556
00:30:38,154 --> 00:30:39,555
intended for military use.

557
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,754
Prepare to be boarded.

558
00:30:41,796 --> 00:30:43,493
They're headed toward us.

559
00:30:43,533 --> 00:30:45,093
If they get any closer

560
00:30:45,137 --> 00:30:47,472
they might be able
to identify us.

561
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:53,521
Gul Benil, our toranium
is urgently needed on Cardassia.

562
00:30:53,557 --> 00:30:56,257
I would hate for you
to have to explain

563
00:30:56,297 --> 00:30:57,766
why it was delayed.

564
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,167
The toranium can wait.

565
00:30:59,204 --> 00:31:01,675
Maquis activity is on the rise
in this sector.

566
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,544
By order of the Central Command

567
00:31:03,581 --> 00:31:06,179
all incoming ships are
to be stopped and searched.

568
00:31:07,924 --> 00:31:09,484
Drop the holo-filter.

569
00:31:09,529 --> 00:31:10,588
Do it.

570
00:31:10,631 --> 00:31:13,867
I can get us out of this
if you let me talk to them.

571
00:31:15,008 --> 00:31:17,138
Please stand by.

572
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,583
Are we within
their weapons range yet?

573
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:21,784
No.

574
00:31:24,532 --> 00:31:25,728
Do as he says

575
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:28,569
but be prepared
to get out of here fast

576
00:31:28,607 --> 00:31:30,042
if it doesn't work.

577
00:31:32,417 --> 00:31:34,650
Gul Benil.

578
00:31:34,689 --> 00:31:37,491
You're not Kobheerians.

579
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:38,862
Very observant of you.

580
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:40,664
Now turn your ships around.

581
00:31:40,703 --> 00:31:42,297
Excuse me?

582
00:31:42,341 --> 00:31:44,744
This is an Alpha Red
Priority Mission

583
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,047
clearance verification:
9218-black.

584
00:31:47,085 --> 00:31:49,352
By authority
of the Central Command

585
00:31:49,424 --> 00:31:52,090
you are ordered
to turn your ships around

586
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:55,366
erase all records of this
encounter from your logs

587
00:31:55,472 --> 00:31:56,805
and talk of it to no one.

588
00:31:56,842 --> 00:31:58,141
Is that clear?

589
00:31:59,749 --> 00:32:04,021
Clearance code verified.

590
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:05,426
My apologies.

591
00:32:05,463 --> 00:32:06,989
I had no idea.

592
00:32:07,033 --> 00:32:08,901
You were doing your duty.

593
00:32:08,938 --> 00:32:10,237
End transmission.

594
00:32:13,883 --> 00:32:16,047
Mr. Garak, I'm impressed.

595
00:32:16,088 --> 00:32:18,082
Ah, it was just
something I overheard

596
00:32:18,127 --> 00:32:20,257
while I was hemming
someone's trousers.

597
00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:22,236
I suggest that we
get away from here

598
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:24,502
as quickly as possible,
in case Gul Benil

599
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:26,672
should decide to show
some initiative.

600
00:32:29,988 --> 00:32:32,391
All right, one more time,
Iliana.

601
00:32:32,461 --> 00:32:35,662
What are the names
of the Starfleet ships

602
00:32:35,702 --> 00:32:38,641
deployed
along the Demilitarized Zone?

603
00:32:42,819 --> 00:32:44,619
I don't know.

604
00:32:44,657 --> 00:32:46,092
That's not acceptable.

605
00:32:46,127 --> 00:32:49,259
As a Bajoran liaison officer,
it's your duty

606
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,772
to help coordinate
Federation activity

607
00:32:51,807 --> 00:32:53,106
near Bajoran space.

608
00:32:54,948 --> 00:32:56,942
Now...

609
00:32:58,122 --> 00:33:00,651
what are the names of the ships

610
00:33:00,695 --> 00:33:03,793
deployed along
the Demilitarized Zone?

611
00:33:08,313 --> 00:33:10,945
Their names, Iliana,
give me their names!

612
00:33:10,986 --> 00:33:13,150
I think you've asked enough
questions for today.

613
00:33:13,192 --> 00:33:14,718
Legate, you can't come in here!

614
00:33:14,762 --> 00:33:16,425
You presume to tell
a member of the Central Command

615
00:33:16,499 --> 00:33:19,028
where he may or may not go
in his own home?

616
00:33:19,073 --> 00:33:20,907
This is Obsidian Order business.

617
00:33:20,943 --> 00:33:21,968
Our autonomy...

618
00:33:22,013 --> 00:33:24,109
Is a privilege granted
by the Central Command

619
00:33:24,151 --> 00:33:26,452
and is revocable at any time.

620
00:33:26,523 --> 00:33:28,994
Don't you agree?

621
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:32,471
Of course, Legate.

622
00:33:32,505 --> 00:33:35,968
Iliana, I'm afraid
the next time we talk

623
00:33:36,012 --> 00:33:38,449
it will have to be
at the Order's facilities.

624
00:33:38,486 --> 00:33:41,015
Good day.

625
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:50,905
Iliana, are you all right?

626
00:34:27,436 --> 00:34:29,270
Iliana...

627
00:34:38,128 --> 00:34:39,962
No...

628
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,769
No!

629
00:34:44,811 --> 00:34:46,440
Iliana...

630
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:52,724
No...

631
00:34:52,764 --> 00:34:54,564
It's all right.

632
00:34:54,601 --> 00:34:56,538
Everything will be all right.

633
00:34:58,377 --> 00:35:00,245
I'm a selfish old man.

634
00:35:00,281 --> 00:35:03,847
I can't keep you here anymore,
no matter how much I want to.

635
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:06,454
Entek will never rest
until he's broken you.

636
00:35:06,496 --> 00:35:08,899
If he takes you
to Order Headquarters...

637
00:35:08,935 --> 00:35:11,840
We must get you away
from Cardassia.

638
00:35:15,184 --> 00:35:17,314
You'd do that for me?

639
00:35:18,459 --> 00:35:20,327
Why?

640
00:35:22,067 --> 00:35:25,097
You're my daughter, Iliana.

641
00:35:25,141 --> 00:35:27,875
There's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

642
00:35:27,914 --> 00:35:30,112
Even...

643
00:35:32,158 --> 00:35:34,652
even if it means
losing you again.

644
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:02,153
Iliana...

645
00:36:06,003 --> 00:36:07,472
here.

646
00:36:07,507 --> 00:36:08,999
For you.

647
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:13,146
It's beautiful.

648
00:36:13,187 --> 00:36:14,918
It was your mother's.

649
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:17,830
I want you to have it...
to remember her by.

650
00:36:17,866 --> 00:36:19,062
I can't take this.

651
00:36:19,101 --> 00:36:21,231
There's no use arguing.

652
00:36:21,274 --> 00:36:23,336
I can be
as stubborn as you.

653
00:36:23,378 --> 00:36:25,007
It runs in the family.

654
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:26,849
Legate.

655
00:36:26,887 --> 00:36:30,293
Iliana, this is Ari.
He's a friend.

656
00:36:30,328 --> 00:36:34,327
He's going to help
get you off Cardassia.

657
00:36:34,372 --> 00:36:36,775
Without the Order's knowledge?

658
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:38,507
How is that possible?

659
00:36:38,548 --> 00:36:41,146
I have friends
who can arrange things.

660
00:36:41,187 --> 00:36:43,658
Friends who think
the same way I do.

661
00:36:43,694 --> 00:36:45,688
The Obsidian Order
and the Central Command

662
00:36:45,732 --> 00:36:48,033
have been given too much power
over our lives.

663
00:36:48,071 --> 00:36:51,169
We're going to change that.

664
00:36:53,383 --> 00:36:54,784
You're a dissident?

665
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,916
Your father is a great man.

666
00:36:56,959 --> 00:36:59,362
He has everything
any Cardassian could want

667
00:36:59,398 --> 00:37:02,030
yet he's willing to risk
his life for what he believes.

668
00:37:02,072 --> 00:37:04,704
People like Ari are the heroes.

669
00:37:04,744 --> 00:37:06,806
My position protects me.

670
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,945
The real risk is theirs.

671
00:37:08,988 --> 00:37:11,289
Legate, I have to get
your daughter

672
00:37:11,326 --> 00:37:12,920
to our next contact.

673
00:37:15,938 --> 00:37:17,407
Good-bye

674
00:37:17,441 --> 00:37:19,571
Iliana.

675
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,385
I love you.

676
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,388
Legate...

677
00:37:23,422 --> 00:37:24,412
Sir, we have to go

678
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:26,223
- now.
- Wait.

679
00:37:26,262 --> 00:37:28,165
This is wrong.

680
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,829
Please, Ari's right.

681
00:37:29,871 --> 00:37:31,135
No, don't you see?

682
00:37:31,174 --> 00:37:33,703
The fact that you're a dissident

683
00:37:33,747 --> 00:37:35,945
that you're willing
to help me...

684
00:37:35,986 --> 00:37:37,387
No, that can't be a coincidence.

685
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:39,417
Iliana, you have to trust me.

686
00:37:39,461 --> 00:37:41,226
We're trying to help you.

687
00:37:41,265 --> 00:37:42,962
No, no, it's Entek
I don't trust.

688
00:37:43,003 --> 00:37:44,734
Why did he go
to so much trouble?

689
00:37:44,773 --> 00:37:49,273
Changing me into a Cardassian,
sending me to you...

690
00:37:52,525 --> 00:37:54,826
It's not me he's after.

691
00:37:54,864 --> 00:37:57,462
What are you talking about?

692
00:37:57,504 --> 00:38:00,774
What if the Order suspects your
involvement with the dissidents?

693
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:02,281
Impossible.

694
00:38:02,316 --> 00:38:03,785
I'm too well-protected.

695
00:38:03,819 --> 00:38:06,724
They couldn't have evidence
of my activities.

696
00:38:06,759 --> 00:38:08,160
But they could still
suspect you.

697
00:38:08,196 --> 00:38:09,221
And without any evidence

698
00:38:09,265 --> 00:38:10,791
they wouldn't dare
interrogate you.

699
00:38:10,836 --> 00:38:11,804
Would they?

700
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:13,467
Central Command
would never allow it.

701
00:38:13,509 --> 00:38:15,844
Which is why they had
to make you betray yourself

702
00:38:15,882 --> 00:38:17,819
which is why they kidnapped me

703
00:38:17,852 --> 00:38:19,846
because I resemble
your daughter.

704
00:38:19,891 --> 00:38:20,859
And they knew you would

705
00:38:20,894 --> 00:38:22,523
never stand by
and watch me be tortured.

706
00:38:22,631 --> 00:38:23,793
They wanted you to do this.

707
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:24,802
They wanted you

708
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:26,670
to try and rescue me.

709
00:38:26,707 --> 00:38:28,301
Very astute, Major.

710
00:38:28,344 --> 00:38:30,976
You couldn't have done any
better if you were one of us.

711
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:32,647
This is Ghemor.

712
00:38:32,688 --> 00:38:35,023
Three to beam out.
Now.

713
00:38:35,061 --> 00:38:36,792
It won't work.

714
00:38:36,831 --> 00:38:38,961
We've got a transporter
suppression field

715
00:38:39,003 --> 00:38:40,370
- over this whole area.
- No!

716
00:38:44,584 --> 00:38:48,047
You don't know how long
I've waited for this day.

717
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:51,589
Imagine... in one bold stroke

718
00:38:51,701 --> 00:38:55,267
the Obsidian Order will unmask
a traitor in the Central Command

719
00:38:55,309 --> 00:38:58,009
and shatter the entire
dissident movement

720
00:38:58,049 --> 00:39:00,043
and we have you
to thank for it.

721
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,457
The movement will survive
without me.

722
00:39:02,493 --> 00:39:07,164
You underestimate
your importance, Legate.

723
00:39:07,204 --> 00:39:09,437
With your help, we'll be able

724
00:39:09,477 --> 00:39:11,505
to purge the government
of all disloyalty.

725
00:39:11,548 --> 00:39:14,544
The enemies of Cardassia
will be destroyed.

726
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:16,992
The enemies of the Order,
you mean.

727
00:39:17,028 --> 00:39:21,095
The Obsidian Order is Cardassia.

728
00:39:26,618 --> 00:39:28,247
What are you doing?

729
00:39:28,288 --> 00:39:29,780
I think you know.

730
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,590
Major.

731
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:34,330
Your testimony would make
for a more dramatic trial

732
00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:36,602
but I'd be willing
to dispense with it

733
00:39:36,642 --> 00:39:38,271
if you give us any trouble.

734
00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:42,845
The Major is the least
of your problems, Entek.

735
00:39:44,126 --> 00:39:45,960
I suggest you lower
your weapons.

736
00:39:46,966 --> 00:39:49,233
Do as he says.

737
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:51,139
Now, Entek!

738
00:39:51,176 --> 00:39:52,577
I'll take that.

739
00:39:52,613 --> 00:39:53,980
Thank you.

740
00:39:57,392 --> 00:39:58,861
Get over with him!

741
00:39:58,895 --> 00:40:01,663
Garak,
what are you doing here?

742
00:40:01,702 --> 00:40:03,502
I got homesick.

743
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:04,838
I think we better be going.

744
00:40:04,876 --> 00:40:06,004
Don't worry.

745
00:40:06,045 --> 00:40:08,711
He's on our side...
I think.

746
00:40:08,752 --> 00:40:09,742
Come on.

747
00:40:11,893 --> 00:40:13,192
Major, I don't think

748
00:40:13,229 --> 00:40:15,861
I've ever seen you
looking so ravishing.

749
00:40:15,903 --> 00:40:16,928
Are you all right?

750
00:40:16,971 --> 00:40:18,099
I'm fine.
How did you...

751
00:40:18,141 --> 00:40:20,078
Suffice it to say, I still
have friends on Cardassia.

752
00:40:20,112 --> 00:40:22,710
You will, no doubt, derive
years of enjoyment

753
00:40:22,752 --> 00:40:24,950
trying to determine
exactly who they are.

754
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,186
Legate, we have a ship waiting.

755
00:40:26,227 --> 00:40:27,195
From the sound of things

756
00:40:27,229 --> 00:40:28,562
I think you better
come with us.

757
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:30,125
Yes, I think that might be wise.

758
00:40:30,169 --> 00:40:32,265
Garak, I don't understand.

759
00:40:32,308 --> 00:40:34,176
Why are you helping
these people?

760
00:40:34,213 --> 00:40:36,116
Ghemor is a traitor,
an enemy of the Order.

761
00:40:36,151 --> 00:40:40,024
Treason, like beauty,
is in the eye of the beholder.

762
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,791
You're making a serious mistake.

763
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:44,028
Up until now,
the Order was satisfied

764
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:46,132
to let you live
in exile, but now...

765
00:40:46,175 --> 00:40:47,143
Come on!

766
00:40:47,177 --> 00:40:48,271
Odo, Garak, let's go!

767
00:40:48,313 --> 00:40:49,942
I'd almost forgotten
what a pleasure it was

768
00:40:49,984 --> 00:40:51,248
to be with my fellow
Cardassians.

769
00:40:51,287 --> 00:40:53,656
And though I'd like to stay
and listen to you bluster

770
00:40:53,692 --> 00:40:55,560
I simply don't have the time.

771
00:41:01,946 --> 00:41:03,917
A pity.

772
00:41:03,951 --> 00:41:05,854
I rather liked him.

773
00:41:15,579 --> 00:41:19,281
So, it was all a lie.

774
00:41:19,321 --> 00:41:20,915
According to Dr. Bashir

775
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:23,795
my genetic structure
is entirely Bajoran.

776
00:41:23,832 --> 00:41:25,803
The alterations were surgical.

777
00:41:25,836 --> 00:41:27,135
What about the man

778
00:41:27,173 --> 00:41:29,144
who said he was
with you at Elemspur?

779
00:41:29,178 --> 00:41:30,306
Gone... completely disappeared.

780
00:41:30,348 --> 00:41:32,182
We suspect he was
a Cardassian agent.

781
00:41:32,218 --> 00:41:33,277
He's probably the one

782
00:41:33,321 --> 00:41:35,349
who changed
the Detention Center records

783
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:36,383
in the first place.

784
00:41:37,397 --> 00:41:39,459
I thought you'd be happy.

785
00:41:39,502 --> 00:41:40,664
I am. It's...

786
00:41:40,705 --> 00:41:42,436
I still don't understand.

787
00:41:42,477 --> 00:41:45,177
If Iliana really was
transformed into a Bajoran

788
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:47,050
then why did Entek
have me kidnapped?

789
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:49,719
Why not bring Iliana
back instead?

790
00:41:49,761 --> 00:41:52,495
Because the desegranine
would have worked on Iliana.

791
00:41:52,534 --> 00:41:54,402
Her memories would have returned

792
00:41:54,438 --> 00:41:56,909
and she would have
cooperated with Entek.

793
00:41:56,944 --> 00:42:01,114
But they knew that you'd resist
and that I'd be forced

794
00:42:01,155 --> 00:42:03,217
to try to get you
off of Cardassia.

795
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,629
Do you think Iliana's
still alive?

796
00:42:05,665 --> 00:42:08,068
I have to.

797
00:42:08,104 --> 00:42:09,869
I'm her father.

798
00:42:09,909 --> 00:42:13,543
For all I know,
she's still on Bajor

799
00:42:13,584 --> 00:42:17,116
and someday, I'll find her.

800
00:42:18,563 --> 00:42:21,034
Are you sure you don't want
to stay on the station?

801
00:42:21,069 --> 00:42:24,441
There's no place for me here.

802
00:42:24,477 --> 00:42:26,539
The Mathenite government

803
00:42:26,582 --> 00:42:29,555
has offered me
political sanctuary.

804
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,389
I'll be safe there.

805
00:42:35,704 --> 00:42:38,336
One more thing before I leave.

806
00:42:38,377 --> 00:42:41,909
Can I give you
some fatherly advice?

807
00:42:41,952 --> 00:42:44,446
For old times' sake.

808
00:42:44,491 --> 00:42:45,824
Of course.

809
00:42:45,861 --> 00:42:50,532
That Garak fellow who helped
you, who helped us

810
00:42:50,573 --> 00:42:52,908
don't trust him, Nerys, ever.

811
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,175
He's a dangerous man

812
00:42:54,215 --> 00:42:56,983
and he'd betray you and all
of your friends in an instant

813
00:42:57,022 --> 00:42:58,548
if he thought
it would help him.

814
00:42:58,592 --> 00:43:01,862
I'll keep my eye on him.

815
00:43:04,439 --> 00:43:08,346
I suppose it's time to go.

816
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:12,417
Here.

817
00:43:12,458 --> 00:43:14,429
It doesn't belong to me.

818
00:43:14,463 --> 00:43:16,366
I can't keep it.

819
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:20,633
No.

820
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:24,950
I want you to have it.

821
00:43:24,989 --> 00:43:29,261
You may not be my daughter,
but, until I find Iliana

822
00:43:29,299 --> 00:43:32,762
you're the closest thing
I have to family.

823
00:43:36,349 --> 00:43:38,513
I want you to know something.

824
00:43:38,554 --> 00:43:40,821
In spite of...

825
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:44,825
whatever I might have said

826
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:47,205
I realize now...

827
00:43:47,242 --> 00:43:50,648
you're an honorable man.

828
00:43:52,989 --> 00:43:59,335
And I think your daughter
must have loved you very much.
