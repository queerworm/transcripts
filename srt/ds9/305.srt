1
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:11,052
Why don't you tell
your Uncle Quark all about it?

2
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:13,263
What are you
talking about, Quark?

3
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,599
You're 15 minutes late
for your appointment
in the holosuites,

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,351
and by the look
of that drink,

5
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,936
you've been nursing
it for a while.

6
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:21,188
You got stood up,
didn't you?

7
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,524
Well, if you must know,

8
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,442
I'm waiting for Major Kira.

9
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,402
We're supposed to go
antigrav sailing together,

10
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,279
but you know how she feels
about the holosuites.

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,365
She feels they're
a complete waste of time.

12
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:32,950
Anything worth doing
in a holosuite

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,869
can be done better
in the real world.

14
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:38,747
You obviously haven't been
in the right holosuite program.

15
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,458
But if you'd like, I could...

16
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,252
You could,
but you'd live to regret it.

17
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,506
Maybe some other time.

18
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,134
I'm sorry I'm late.

19
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,387
Sisko and I had to revise
crew rotations<i> again.</i>

20
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,764
So you're not canceling?
No!

21
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,058
I'm... kind of looking
forward to it,

22
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,393
except for crashing.

23
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,144
Well, don't worry,
you won't crash.

24
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,689
We'll start out
with an easy simulation

25
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,358
like... sailing
across the Great Erg

26
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,027
on New Mecca.

27
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:10,696
You'll see.
It'll be great.

28
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,031
CREWMAN:
Ops to Major Kira.

29
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:13,323
Kira here.

30
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,325
You have an incoming
communication

31
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,369
from the Bajoran
Central Archives.

32
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,746
I'm in the Replimat.

33
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:19,872
I'll take it down here.

34
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,790
This will only
take a minute.

35
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,209
This is Major Kira.

36
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,502
Major.

37
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,170
My name is Alenis Grem.

38
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,548
I'm doing a study on
the Elemspur Detention Center

39
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,425
for the Bajoran
Central Archives,

40
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,260
and, um,
I was hoping to ask you

41
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,387
a few questions.

42
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,806
I'd be glad to help,
but why come to me?

43
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,391
I was never at Elemspur.

44
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,977
Cardassian records
clearly indicate

45
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:45,146
that a Kira Nerys
was held at Elemspur

46
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,607
for, uh... seven days.

47
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,358
You've got the wrong
Kira Nerys.

48
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,444
Believe me.

49
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,529
If I'd been held in a
Cardassian prison, I'd remember.

50
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,281
I don't understand.

51
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,033
I have the records
right here.

52
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,410
Kira Nerys
of Dahkur Province,

53
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,162
a member of the Shakaar
resistance cell.

54
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,500
You see?

55
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,129
It's you.

56
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:18,258
If your memory

57
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,135
and these prison records
don't agree,

58
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,137
then one of them
must be wrong--

59
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,889
either the records, or...

60
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,600
My memory is fine.

61
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,352
I know<i> exactly</i>
where I was that week.

62
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,189
After ten years?
I spent the
entire winter

63
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,524
with my resistance group
in the Dahkur Hills.

64
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,694
We had no power cells for
our phasers, very little food,

65
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,821
and we spent most
of our time in caves,

66
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,990
hiding from
the Cardassian sensor sweeps.

67
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,576
Believe me, it was
very memorable.

68
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,203
These records are fake.

69
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:51,917
The only question is,
who faked them and why.

70
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:55,629
According to this,
you supposedly shared a cell

71
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,714
with three other inmates.

72
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,508
Maybe one of them
can help us find out

73
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,302
what's going on here.

74
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,388
Elemspur...

75
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,142
I haven't thought about
that place for a long time.

76
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:10,310
I was hoping you could answer
some questions

77
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,519
about your fellow prisoners.

78
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,355
I'll try...

79
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,316
Now, wait...

80
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,777
I remember you.

81
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,904
You were there, too,
weren't you?

82
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,114
Kiri something.

83
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,244
Kira.
Kira Nerys.

84
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,370
Yeah, I almost didn't
recognize you.

85
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,582
You used to wear your hair
differently, didn't you?

86
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,834
Uh... longer?

87
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,297
You remember me...

88
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:39,756
after all this time.

89
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,258
When the Cardassians

90
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:44,343
dragged you out of our cell,
I gave you up for dead.

91
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:47,430
Glad to see I was wrong.

92
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,392
Those were bad times.

93
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,353
Yes, they were.

94
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,320
He could have been lying.

95
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,654
Maybe, but the records

96
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,323
and the only
surviving witness

97
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:05,907
both say
I was at Elemspur.

98
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,035
My memory says
something different.

99
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,703
I got to find out the truth.

100
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,996
I understand.

101
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,498
If there's
anything you need...

102
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,749
I'll let you know.

103
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,584
This shouldn't take long.

104
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,879
I should only be
on Bajor a few days.

105
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,298
We'll try to manage
without you

106
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,590
until you get back.

107
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,321
There you are, Garak.
Ah.

108
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,865
I went past your shop,
but it was closed.

109
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:47,991
Well, unfortunately,

110
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,326
business has been
a bit slow.

111
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,036
I mean, for some reason

112
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,913
living under the constant
threat of Dominion attack

113
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:57,000
has made people less eager
to invest in new clothing.

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,502
So how was your trip
to Klaestron IV?

115
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,712
Oh, terrific.

116
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,756
The Klaestrons
have developed

117
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,549
a new burn
treatment technology

118
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,718
which has to be seen
to be believed.

119
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,095
You know, I envy you.

120
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,305
How so?
When I was younger,

121
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:13,016
traveling was a bit
of a passion for me.

122
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,435
There are few things in life
that compare

123
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,687
with the thrill
of immersing yourself

124
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,731
in the culture
of an alien world,

125
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:22,359
meeting the inhabitants,
earning their trust.

126
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,153
But aside from<i> our</i> brief
excursion to Bajor,

127
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,530
I don't think I've been
off this station

128
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,698
in nearly three years.

129
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,325
Well, what's stopping you?

130
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,994
Ships are leaving Deep Space 9
almost every day.

131
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,996
Space is dangerous, Doctor.

132
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,665
You never know
what might happen.

133
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,752
Garak, you're being paranoid.

134
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,254
(<i> chuckles</i> )
Are you saying

135
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,505
the Cardassian government
would have you killed

136
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,174
if you left this station?

137
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:51,305
My dear doctor, you do have
a vivid imagination.

138
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,893
Commander, we're receiving
a transmission

139
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,728
from Bajoran Central Archives.

140
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,063
I'll take it.

141
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,569
If you're looking
for Major Kira, I'm afraid

142
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,989
she's not on the station
right now, she's on Bajor.

143
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,616
I know.
That's why I called.

144
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,077
The Major contacted me
before she left.

145
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,620
She was supposed
to meet with me

146
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,205
so I could show her
the information

147
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,873
I'd retrieved from Elemspur.

148
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,500
She never came.

149
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,128
I tried to contact
the Major to reschedule

150
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,963
but she wasn't
where she said she'd be.

151
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,715
As far as I can tell,
no one's seen her

152
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,677
since she left the spaceport
for Elemspur.

153
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,098
Wake her.

154
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,066
Where am I?

155
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,277
It's all right.
You're safe.

156
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,341
What have you done to me?

157
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:12,719
We've brought
you back home.

158
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,388
To Cardassia.

159
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,323
Please...

160
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,991
we're here to help you.

161
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,744
I don't know who you are
or what you're trying to do,

162
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,454
but it won't work.

163
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,456
Whatever you think<i> this</i>
is going to get you,

164
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,250
you can forget it.

165
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,793
We don't think
it's going to<i> get</i> us anything.

166
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,629
If all we wanted
was information,
we'd have it already.

167
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,132
Oh, well, then
what's stopping you?

168
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,176
We have no intention
of hurting you.

169
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,429
Why should we?
You're one of us.

170
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,804
This is absurd.

171
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,266
You can mutilate me,
change my appearance.

172
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,560
You are never going
to convince me

173
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,311
that I am a Cardassian.

174
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,397
I know this is difficult
for you.

175
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,232
I'm sorry.

176
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,691
I wish there were a better way
to prepare you

177
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,944
for what you're going through.

178
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:15,823
Sometimes I question the wisdom
of our infiltration methods.

179
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,826
By altering the memories
of our long-term operatives,

180
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,203
we ensure that

181
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,497
they'll never
be discovered,

182
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:25,708
but it makes reintegrating them
back into Cardassian society

183
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,835
much more difficult.

184
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,880
Still, it's hard to argue
with success.

185
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,133
You really expect me
to believe all of this?

186
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,385
Oh, of course not.

187
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,513
At least, not yet.

188
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:42,434
We've given you medication
to reverse your memory loss,

189
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:46,020
but it can take some time
to become effective.

190
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,689
Until your original
memory reemerges,

191
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:52,152
I don't expect you
to believe a word I say.

192
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,862
But it still can be difficult

193
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,198
watching someone
you care about suffer.

194
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:01,411
Oh. So I suppose you and I
are old friends.

195
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,079
I supervised your training.

196
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,998
Ah...

197
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,876
You are an undercover operative

198
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:12,172
of the Obsidian Order
named Iliana Ghemor.

199
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,508
Ten years ago,
you volunteered

200
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,884
for an undercover assignment
on Bajor.

201
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,053
We kidnapped
a Bajoran terrorist,

202
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,722
gave you her memories,
her appearance,

203
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,517
and placed you back on Bajor

204
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,560
to infiltrate
the resistance.

205
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,648
I know.

206
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,358
You don't believe me.

207
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,026
But you'll remember.

208
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,362
It will just take some time.

209
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:39,240
See?
Being here should help.

210
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,452
This place?

211
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:45,622
It's just another
Cardassian prison.

212
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,999
This is not a prison, Iliana.

213
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:51,961
This is your room in the house
where you were born.

214
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,505
Your home.

215
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:57,758
My home is in
the Dahkur Province of Bajor.

216
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:03,764
Here. This contains a personal
statement you recorded

217
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,933
before you were sent to Bajor.

218
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,352
Watch it.

219
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,104
It should help explain things.

220
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,529
(<i> sighs</i> )

221
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,198
If you have any questions,
just ask.

222
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,418
We've interviewed
all the residents

223
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,212
in the vicinity of the
Elemspur Detention Center.

224
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,506
One of them<i> thinks</i>
he saw Kira

225
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:39,426
walking up the old
Cardassian road
toward the Center.

226
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:42,053
When we scanned the area,
we found a residual

227
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,138
electrostatic
charge.

228
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,807
This could be
a transporter trace.

229
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,644
Do you think
she was beamed away?

230
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:55,191
All right, I want to know
the name of every ship

231
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,611
that was in the area
at the time of the beam-out.

232
00:12:57,611 --> 00:13:00,363
Constable, contact your friends
in the Bajoran militia.

233
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,490
Tell them we need to see
the activity logs

234
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,118
of all the ground-based
transporters in the area.

235
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,454
That'll be all.

236
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:11,958
Benjamin, those residual
electrostatic charges--

237
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,043
they could also
have been left

238
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,503
by a disrupter
or a phaser

239
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,422
set to kill.

240
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,674
I know.

241
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,551
...to the children.

242
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:25,263
They are the future
of Cardassia, and they...

243
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:31,686
(<i> crackling</i> )

244
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,240
(<i> chime sounds</i> )

245
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:51,956
(<i> chime sounds</i> )

246
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,334
Enter!

247
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,465
Ah. There's someone here
who wants to see you.

248
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,383
You took your time
about it, Entek.

249
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,719
I don't appreciate being
kept waiting in my own house.

250
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,429
As I explained, Legate,

251
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,306
the initial debriefings
can be difficult.

252
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,683
We couldn't allow
any interruptions.

253
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,142
Ah!

254
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,070
It really is you.

255
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,533
Remember,
her memory
hasn't returned yet.

256
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,619
I understand.

257
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,331
Iliana, I...

258
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:37,251
I wish I could tell you
how much this means to me.

259
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,297
Am I supposed
to know you?

260
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,843
Iliana, this is
Legate Tekeny Ghemor.

261
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:46,260
He's your father.

262
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,096
My father?

263
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:55,770
My father died on Bajor
fighting Cardassians.

264
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,021
That's not true.

265
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,192
I'm sorry.

266
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:04,070
I know you don't
remember me,

267
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,906
but I've been waiting
for this for so long.

268
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,243
Please, leave us.

269
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,246
Are you sure that's wise?

270
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,914
She's my daughter.

271
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,542
She's not going to hurt me.

272
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,043
As you wish.

273
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,719
I've missed you, Iliana.

274
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:30,555
Don't call me that.

275
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,562
It's not my name.

276
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,815
And I am<i> not</i> your daughter.

277
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,776
I should let you rest.

278
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,614
You will remember, in time.

279
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,658
Until then, please,
consider yourself

280
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,285
a guest in this house.

281
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,865
Oh, good evening, Doctor.

282
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,450
If you're finished here,

283
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,577
I was wondering if
you'd like to join me

284
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,412
for a late snack.

285
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,915
Um, actually, all I want
right now is a little sleep.

286
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,333
Maybe tomorrow.

287
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,251
I'm afraid this can't
wait until tomorrow.

288
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,922
I have very important
news about Major Kira.

289
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,934
In the left corner,
above the window.

290
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,647
What?

291
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:05,065
The Obsidian Order
surveillance devices.

292
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,777
That is what you're
looking for, isn't it?

293
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,362
Don't worry.
They're not on.

294
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,280
I'm a member
of the Central Command.

295
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,158
They're only activated
at my request.

296
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,911
I thought you might
want some breakfast.

297
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:20,623
I assumed you'd be used
to Bajoran food by now,

298
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,668
so I took the liberty
of replicating some<i> hasperat.</i>

299
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,127
I'm not hungry.

300
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,384
You recognize that?

301
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,053
It's the bone carving
you made for me

302
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,389
when I was promoted to Legate.

303
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,099
Your daughter was talented.

304
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:43,855
Yes.

305
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:46,024
She is.

306
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,860
I always thought you
should have been an artist--

307
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,278
you have such a wonderful
eye for detail--

308
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,990
but you were determined
to join the Order.

309
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,952
You thought it
was your duty
to Cardassia.

310
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:02,081
Personally, I think Cardassia
could use a few more artists.

311
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,545
Are you sure you won't try
some<i> hasperat?</i>

312
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,839
It's only good when it's warm.

313
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,009
No.
Thank you.

314
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:17,137
You're as stubborn
as your mother.

315
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:25,730
She could never do anything
the easy way.

316
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,233
You don't remember
her, either, do you?

317
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:36,032
My mother was an icon painter
from Dahkur Province.

318
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:40,787
She died of malnutrition
at the Singha refugee camp

319
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,455
when I was three.

320
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,624
Your mother
was an Inquisitor

321
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,292
at the Central University.

322
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,796
This is my fault.

323
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,008
I never should have let
you go on that mission.

324
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,593
I could have
prevented it.

325
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,219
A well-placed
word here,

326
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,013
a favor from
a friend there.

327
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,515
You never would
have known.

328
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,936
But... you were so
determined to go,

329
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:07,438
so proud that
you'd been chosen

330
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:10,650
that I didn't have
the heart to stop you.

331
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,903
Your mother
never forgave me.

332
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:17,865
You're good.

333
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,660
Really good.

334
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,579
The house, the food,
the stories--

335
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,915
it's all very convincing.

336
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,044
But I don't believe
a word of it.

337
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:36,843
Iliana, I just want you
to know... I'm sorry.

338
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,936
Commander, I've already

339
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,980
told the good doctor
everything I know.

340
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,190
I'd like to hear it
again firsthand.

341
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,733
This is pointless.

342
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,777
Believe me, there's
nothing you can do.

343
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,362
If my friend
is correct

344
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,573
and Major Kira is being
held by the Obsidian Order,

345
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,993
retrieving her
would be impossible.

346
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:05,955
Impossible for us maybe,
but not for you.

347
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,915
I'm afraid you overestimate
my abilities.

348
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,792
I hope not, because
I intend to put

349
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,502
your abilities
to the test.

350
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,880
The three of us are
going to Cardassia.

351
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,048
The three of us?

352
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,800
You can't be serious.

353
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,302
Commander, if I were
allowed on Cardassia,

354
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,056
do you really think
I'd be living here?

355
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,474
Which brings up
an interesting point.

356
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,476
There are certain ministers
in the Bajoran government

357
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,896
who are concerned
about your presence
on this station.

358
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,898
In fact, they
want you removed.

359
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,774
Right now, I see no alternative

360
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,818
but to honor their request.

361
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,987
Unless, of course,
I can show them

362
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:40,114
how you might be
valuable to us.

363
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,742
ODO:
Rescuing Kira would
go a long way

364
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:46,037
toward improving your standing
with the Bajoran government.

365
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:49,165
Why should I care what the
Bajoran government thinks of me?

366
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,458
I don't know,
but it seems to me,

367
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:55,462
if someone were in trouble with
the Cardassian Central Command,

368
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:58,507
a Bajoran space station
under Federation control

369
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,468
might just be the safest place
in the galaxy.

370
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:04,931
Commander, this is extortion.

371
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,640
Mmm.

372
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:09,351
Yes, it is.

373
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,605
SISKO:
We'll be traveling

374
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:13,981
under false
transit documents

375
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,942
prepared by Starfleet
Intelligence.

376
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,235
Mr. O'Brien
has reconfigured

377
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,153
the shield harmonics
of the<i> Defiant</i>

378
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:21,739
so that, on long-range
sensors, we'll appear to be

379
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,032
a Kobheerian freighter.

380
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,703
We leave
in three hours.

381
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,831
I'll go along on
your fool's errand,

382
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,751
but I want one thing
to be perfectly clear:

383
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,211
I have no intention

384
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,213
of sacrificing my life
to save yours.

385
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,882
If it looks like we're
in danger of being captured,

386
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,550
if there's any sign
of trouble at all,

387
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,427
you're on your own.

388
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,554
Mr. Garak, I believe

389
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,348
that's the first
completely honest thing
you've ever said to me.

390
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,061
How perceptive
of you, Commander.

391
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:59,359
She doesn't remember anything?

392
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,112
Not yet.

393
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,114
That's
unfortunate.

394
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:05,866
It would have made
things easier.

395
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,452
I'm afraid
I'm going

396
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,663
to have to ask you
some questions.

397
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:11,956
So soon?

398
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,624
I thought
she'd be given time

399
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,001
to regain her memory.

400
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,627
She<i> was</i>
given time.

401
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,796
The desegranine
injections

402
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:20,380
should have worked by now.

403
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,466
Memories usually
begin to resurface

404
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,676
after only a few hours.

405
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,928
It's been two days.

406
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,807
And what if the
injections never work?

407
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,814
Your daughter has some
information that we need.

408
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:39,066
I'm sure, in time,

409
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,401
she'll see the wisdom
of cooperating.

410
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,114
So...

411
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,532
if you'll excuse us.

412
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,621
I'll be in the next room
if you need me.

413
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,748
Legate, your concerns
are baseless.

414
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,500
She's one of
our own people.

415
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,585
We have no reason
to harm her.

416
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,588
And I'll be nearby
to remind you of that...

417
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,465
in case you forget.

418
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,968
As you wish, Legate.

419
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,184
What were
your duties

420
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:16,145
as First Officer
of Deep Space 9?

421
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:19,065
I told you, the Federation
runs the station.

422
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:21,441
I wasn't even
allowed into Ops.

423
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:23,903
How many Starfleet
personnel

424
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,822
are stationed
on Deep Space 9?

425
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,949
Hmm, 30... 40,000.

426
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,660
Don't tell them
I told you.

427
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,537
That's enough!

428
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,663
Iliana...

429
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,292
Oh.

430
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:39,835
(<i> sighs</i> )

431
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:43,214
Don't you understand
what's going on here?

432
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:46,050
I'm trying
to give you a chance.

433
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,426
Even if you don't
remember who I am,

434
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:51,097
you are still
one of my operatives.

435
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:53,015
Now, I don't want
to hurt you,

436
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,226
but if you
don't cooperate...

437
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:01,274
Maybe there is a way
to convince you

438
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:03,734
to take what I say seriously.

439
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,069
This is Entek.

440
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:08,739
Send me exhibit S1983I
immediately.

441
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,532
MALE:
Yes, sir.

442
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:19,959
Nothing you can show me
will make any difference.

443
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:23,170
Did you know that
the Obsidian Order

444
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:27,383
saves everything that comes
into its possession?

445
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:30,386
You never know
what might prove useful.

446
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,721
We have libraries
of data transcripts,

447
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,599
vaults of ancient artifacts,
even...

448
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:39,145
Ah! Here it is.

449
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,855
Even cryogenic chambers
containing biological subjects

450
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,316
like this one here.

451
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,238
That's impossible.

452
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,240
I assure you,

453
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,367
when it comes
to the Obsidian Order,

454
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,786
nothing is impossible.

455
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,671
It's a fake.

456
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:09,591
A clone, a hologram.

457
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,927
For all I know, this whole
place is a holosuite.

458
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,429
(<i> laughs</i> )

459
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,681
Do you remember

460
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,391
when you were on
long-range reconnaissance

461
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,517
in the Bestri Woods?

462
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:22,021
You thought you saw
a Cardassian soldier
and opened fire on him.

463
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,772
You hit your target,
only to find out...

464
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,483
I killed a<i> hara</i> cat.

465
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:28,694
Ah. A mother<i> hara</i> cat
who was nursing her young.

466
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:34,200
How do you know that?

467
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,162
I never told
anyone that story.

468
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:41,748
I know about it,
because<i> we</i> placed that story

469
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,792
in your memories, Iliana,

470
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,628
just like we gave you
every other memory you have.

471
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,839
What we couldn't extract
from the real Kira,

472
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:52,426
we got from other prisoners
or just... invented ourselves.

473
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:56,680
Ask yourself
two things, Iliana.

474
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,934
First, is there anything
that I've said we've done

475
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,979
that's beyond the capabilities
of the Obsidian Order?

476
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:07,316
I assume you know
there isn't.

477
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:08,734
Second...

478
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,903
<i>if</i> you're not my operative,

479
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,489
if you're<i> not</i>
who I say you are,

480
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:16,075
why would I be
playing this game?

481
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,826
Believe me...

482
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,787
if I wanted to extract
the information from you,

483
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,373
I'd have it already.

484
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:24,833
I don't want to do that.

485
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,169
I care about you.

486
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:33,008
And you were one
of my best students.

487
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,431
Watch the recording,
think about what I've said,

488
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:40,891
because the Order
won't wait much longer.

489
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:01,287
GHEMOR:
I see you
haven't forgotten

490
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:03,289
all of your Obsidian
Order training.

491
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,252
Actually, I learned that
in the resistance.

492
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:10,670
Next time, you might want to
leave a contact wire running

493
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,048
between the wall
and the access plate.

494
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,884
You tripped the silent alarm
when you separated them.

495
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,970
I'll keep that in mind.

496
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,348
I suppose if I walk out of here,
you'll try to stop me.

497
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,975
I don't have to.

498
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,935
You wouldn't get
half a kilometer

499
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:27,313
without being detected
by the Obsidian Order.

500
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:30,149
Maybe I'm willing
to take that chance.

501
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,609
Iliana...

502
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:33,444
<i>Stop</i> calling me that.

503
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:36,822
I am<i> not</i> your daughter,
and I never was.

504
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,160
I'm leaving.

505
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,078
You'll never get
off Cardassia.

506
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:46,748
In the end,
you'll only make things
worse for yourself.

507
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,084
I can only do so much
to help you.

508
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:52,838
If you want to help me,
get me off this planet.

509
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,423
I will never cooperate
with the Order.

510
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,300
Eventually, they're going
to realize that.

511
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,595
They will interrogate me,
and I won't survive.

512
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,805
I promise you that
will never happen.

513
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,057
I'll never allow the
Order to harm you.

514
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,601
No matter what
you decide,

515
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,353
I won't let
them hurt you.

516
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:10,439
I only ask one thing.

517
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:13,359
Before you make your
decision, I beg you,

518
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,486
watch the recording
Entek gave you.

519
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:17,196
It's the only way

520
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,781
you'll ever really
know the truth.

521
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,921
(<i> electronic beeping</i> )

522
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,843
Begin playback.

523
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,303
Hello, Iliana.

524
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,180
Welcome home.

525
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:48,561
I've been asked to make these
recordings for myself, for you,

526
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:51,522
to help my memory recover
when I get back.

527
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:53,566
I go in for surgery tomorrow.

528
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,192
I'm going to miss Cardassia,

529
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:56,985
but I know
what I'm doing is right.

530
00:28:56,985 --> 00:29:00,780
The terrorism on Bajor
has to be stopped.

531
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,992
Father doesn't want me to go.

532
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:08,121
Mother... just looks unhappy
all the time.

533
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,500
I hope someday
they understand.

534
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,961
I want them to be proud of me.

535
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,886
How are
the modifications

536
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,846
to the shield
harmonics holding up?

537
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,891
So far, so good.
Nobody here
but us Kobheerians.

538
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,976
We're well into
Cardassian space

539
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,895
so keep a close eye on
that shield modulator.

540
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,522
If it breaks down,

541
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,815
we could be in for
some unwelcome company.

542
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,401
ODO:
Commander, I just caught Garak

543
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:38,652
snooping around
the access corridor

544
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:40,153
outside the main
phaser banks.

545
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,155
I was merely taking a stroll
to stretch my legs.

546
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,074
The quarters
on this "vessel"

547
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:46,159
are rather
claustrophobic.

548
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,661
Confine him to his cabin
for the rest of the trip

549
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:49,913
and post a guard
at the door.

550
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,873
Commander,
I must protest.

551
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,917
You can protest
all you like...

552
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,753
Benjamin, I'm detecting
two Galor-class warships

553
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:57,379
headed this way.

554
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,548
What about
the shield harmonics?
Still holding.

555
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:01,174
As far as their scanners
are concerned,

556
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,093
we should still look like
a Kobheerian freighter.

557
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:06,346
It's probably just
a routine security check.

558
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,848
They're hailing us.
Drop out of warp.

559
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,726
I don't want
to get too close to them.

560
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,061
Is the communications
holo-filter ready?

561
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,896
I can make
your com image

562
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,190
look like 3,000-ton
screech rhino

563
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,567
if you want me to.

564
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:21,153
A Kobheerian captain
will do nicely, Lieutenant.

565
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,529
Engage the overlay.

566
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,905
Put them on screen.

567
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,283
This is Gul Benil
of the Eighth Order.

568
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:27,909
Identify yourself.

569
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,828
This is the Kobheerian
Freighter<i> Rak-Minunis.</i>

570
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,122
I'm Captain Viterian.
How can I help you?

571
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:33,832
What is your destination?

572
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,459
Cardassia Prime.

573
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,586
We're carrying a shipment
of Kobheerian toranium

574
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:38,878
intended for military use.

575
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:41,006
Prepare to be boarded.

576
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,800
They're headed
toward us.

577
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,468
If they get any closer

578
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,804
they might be able
to identify us.

579
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,308
Gul Benil,
our toranium

580
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:52,726
is urgently needed on Cardassia.

581
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:55,479
I would hate for you
to have to explain

582
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:57,105
why it was delayed.

583
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,565
The toranium can wait.

584
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,900
Maquis activity is on the rise
in this sector.

585
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,986
By order of
the Central Command,

586
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,489
all incoming ships are
to be stopped and searched.

587
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:10,118
Drop the holo-filter.
Do it.

588
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:13,079
I can get us out of this
if you let me talk to them.

589
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,542
Please stand by.

590
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,711
Are we within their
weapons range yet?

591
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:20,962
No.

592
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,091
Do as he says,

593
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,845
but be prepared to
get out of here fast

594
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:29,262
if it doesn't work.

595
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:33,975
Gul Benil.

596
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,770
You're not Kobheerians.

597
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,230
Very observant of you.

598
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,023
Now turn your ships around.

599
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,734
Excuse me?

600
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:44,027
This is an Alpha Red
Priority Mission,

601
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,363
clearance verification:
9218-black.

602
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:48,824
By authority
of the Central Command,

603
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,451
you are ordered
to turn your ships around,

604
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,663
erase all records of this
encounter from your logs,

605
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:56,122
and talk of it to no one.

606
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,541
Is that clear?

607
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,000
(<i> electronic beeping</i> )

608
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,671
COMPUTER VOICE:
Clearance code verified.

609
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,715
My apologies.

610
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:06,466
I had no idea.

611
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,343
You were doing your duty.

612
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,511
End transmission.

613
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,098
(<i> sighs</i> )

614
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,475
Mr. Garak,
I'm impressed.

615
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,477
Ah, it was just
something I overheard

616
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,730
while I was hemming
someone's trousers.

617
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,690
I suggest that we
get away from here

618
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,776
as quickly as possible,
in case Gul Benil

619
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:25,778
should decide to show
some initiative.

620
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:32,492
All right, one
more time, Iliana.

621
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:35,245
What are the names
of the Starfleet ships

622
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:37,956
deployed along the
Demilitarized Zone?

623
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,837
I don't know.

624
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:45,464
That's not acceptable.

625
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,340
As a Bajoran
liaison officer,

626
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,675
it's your duty

627
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,094
to help coordinate
Federation activity

628
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,262
near Bajoran space.

629
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,057
Now...

630
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:59,895
what are the names
of the ships

631
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:02,856
deployed along
the Demilitarized Zone?

632
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:10,405
Their names, Iliana,
give me their names!

633
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,532
GHEMOR:
I think you've asked enough
questions for today.

634
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,242
Legate, you<i> can't</i>
come in here!

635
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,911
You presume to tell
a member of the Central Command

636
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:18,371
where he may or may not go
in his own home?

637
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:21,207
This is
Obsidian Order business.
Our autonomy...

638
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,460
Is a privilege granted
by the Central Command

639
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,712
and is revocable
at any time.

640
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,381
Don't you agree?

641
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:31,885
Of course, Legate.

642
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:35,263
Iliana, I'm afraid
the next time we talk,

643
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,683
it will have to be
at the Order's facilities.

644
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:40,143
Good day.

645
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,987
Iliana, are you all right?

646
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,441
Iliana...

647
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,036
No...

648
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,041
No!

649
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:45,584
Iliana...

650
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,794
(<i> sobbing</i> )

651
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,924
No...

652
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:53,717
It's all right.

653
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:55,719
Everything will be all right.

654
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,681
I'm a selfish old man.

655
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:03,184
I can't keep you here anymore,
no matter how much I want to.

656
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,896
Entek will never rest
until he's broken you.

657
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:08,147
If he takes you
to Order Headquarters...

658
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:11,150
We must get you away
from Cardassia.

659
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,489
You'd do that for me?

660
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,492
Why?

661
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:24,289
You're my daughter, Iliana.

662
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:27,166
There's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

663
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,210
Even...

664
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,882
even if it means
losing you again.

665
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,867
Iliana...

666
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,331
here.

667
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,749
For you.

668
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,878
It's beautiful.

669
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,297
It was your mother's.

670
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:17,134
I want you to have it...
to remember her by.

671
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:18,217
I can't take this.

672
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,428
There's no use arguing.

673
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,597
I can be
as stubborn as you.

674
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,182
It runs in the family.

675
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,059
Legate.

676
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:29,604
Iliana, this is Ari.
He's a friend.

677
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:33,399
He's going to help
get you off Cardassia.

678
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:36,069
Without the
Order's knowledge?

679
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,737
How is that possible?

680
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,532
I have friends
who can arrange things.

681
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,868
Friends who think
the same way I do.

682
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:44,911
The Obsidian Order
and the Central Command

683
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,330
have been given too much power
over our lives.

684
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:50,333
We're going to change that.

685
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,046
You're a dissident?

686
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:56,131
ARI:
Your father is a great man.

687
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:58,675
He has everything
any Cardassian could want,

688
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:01,344
yet he's willing to risk
his life for what he believes.

689
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,972
People like Ari
are the heroes.

690
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:06,183
My position protects me.

691
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:08,267
The real risk is theirs.

692
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,478
ARI:
Legate, I have to get
your daughter

693
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,064
to our next contact.

694
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:16,651
Good-bye...

695
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,611
Iliana.

696
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,490
I love you.
Legate...

697
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,284
Sir, we have to go<i> </i>
<i>now.</i>
Wait.

698
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,245
This is wrong.

699
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,081
Please, Ari's right.

700
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:30,373
No, don't you see?

701
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,834
The fact that
you're a dissident,

702
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:35,128
that you're willing
to help me...

703
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:36,546
No, that can't be
a coincidence.

704
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:38,548
Iliana, you have to trust me.

705
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:40,425
We're trying to help you.

706
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,177
No, no, it's Entek
I don't trust.

707
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:43,887
Why did he go
to so much trouble?

708
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:48,433
Changing me into a Cardassian,
sending me to you...

709
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:54,064
It's not me he's after.

710
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:56,900
What are you talking about?

711
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,986
What if the Order suspects your
involvement with the dissidents?

712
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,362
Impossible.

713
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:02,864
I'm too well-protected.

714
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,909
They couldn't have evidence
of my activities.

715
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,326
But they could still
suspect you.

716
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,912
And without any evidence,

717
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:11,039
they wouldn't dare
interrogate you, would they?

718
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,832
Central Command
would never allow it.

719
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,127
Which is why they had
to make you betray yourself,

720
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:17,003
which is why they kidnapped me,

721
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,755
because I resemble
your daughter.

722
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:20,048
And they knew you would

723
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,800
never stand by
and watch me be tortured.

724
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,468
They wanted you to do this.

725
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,887
They wanted you
to try and rescue me.

726
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:27,764
ENTEK:
Very astute, Major.

727
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:30,058
You couldn't have done any
better if you were one of us.

728
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,768
This is Ghemor.

729
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:34,271
Three to beam out.
Now.

730
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:35,939
It won't work.

731
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:38,191
We've got a transporter
suppression field

732
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:39,525
over this
whole area.
No!

733
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:46,992
You don't know how long
I've waited for this day.

734
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:50,829
Imagine--
in one bold stroke,

735
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:54,249
the Obsidian Order will unmask
a traitor in the Central Command

736
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:57,002
<i>and</i> shatter the entire
dissident movement,

737
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:59,045
and we have you
to thank for it.

738
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,506
The movement will
survive without me.

739
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:06,219
You underestimate
your importance, Legate.

740
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:08,554
With your help, we'll be able

741
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,640
to purge the government
of all disloyalty.

742
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,476
The enemies of Cardassia
will be destroyed.

743
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,937
The enemies of
the Order, you mean.

744
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:19,941
The Obsidian Order
<i>is</i> Cardassia.

745
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,240
What are you doing?

746
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,741
ENTEK:
I think you know.

747
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,660
Major.

748
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,288
Your testimony would make
for a more dramatic trial,

749
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:35,498
but I'd be willing
to dispense with it

750
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,083
if you give us any trouble.

751
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,668
(<i> door opens</i> )

752
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,419
GARAK:
The Major is the least

753
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,587
of your problems, Entek.

754
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:44,716
I suggest you lower
your weapons.

755
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,011
GARAK:
Do as he says.

756
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:50,138
Now, Entek!

757
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:51,472
I'll take that.

758
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,932
Thank you.

759
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,226
(<i> yells</i> )

760
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,770
Get over with him!

761
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,897
ENTEK:
Garak,

762
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,565
what are you doing here?

763
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,317
I got homesick.

764
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:03,735
I think we
better be going.

765
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,278
Don't worry.

766
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:07,613
He's on our side...
I think.

767
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,448
Come on.

768
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,118
Major, I don't think

769
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,079
I've ever seen you
looking so ravishing.

770
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,288
Are you
all right?

771
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:16,956
I'm fine.
How did you...

772
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,000
Suffice it to say, I still
have friends on Cardassia.

773
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,711
You will, no doubt, derive
years of enjoyment

774
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,755
trying to determine
exactly who they are.

775
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,631
Legate, we have
a ship waiting.

776
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,342
From the sound of things
I think you better
come with us.

777
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:29,010
Yes, I think that
might be wise.

778
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,137
ENTEK:
Garak, I don't understand.

779
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,014
Why are you helping
these people?

780
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,016
Ghemor is a traitor,
an enemy of the Order.

781
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:38,770
Treason, like beauty,
is in the eye of the beholder.

782
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,605
You're making
a serious mistake.

783
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,941
Up until now, the
Order was satisfied

784
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,901
to let you live
in exile, but now...

785
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:47,153
Come on!
Odo, Garak, let's go!

786
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,780
I'd almost forgotten
what a pleasure it was

787
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,531
to be with my
fellow Cardassians.

788
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,409
And though I'd like to stay
and listen to you bluster,

789
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:54,327
I simply don't have the time.

790
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,752
A pity.

791
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,670
I rather liked him.

792
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:18,268
So, it was all a lie.

793
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:19,769
According to Dr. Bashir,

794
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:22,605
my genetic structure
is entirely Bajoran.

795
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,649
The alterations
were surgical.

796
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:25,942
What about the man

797
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:28,027
who said he was
with you at Elemspur?

798
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,237
Gone-- completely
disappeared.

799
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:31,072
We suspect he was
a Cardassian agent.

800
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:32,365
He's probably the one

801
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:34,659
who changed the
Detention Center records

802
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,161
in the first place.

803
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:38,079
I thought
you'd be happy.

804
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,374
I am. It's...
I still don't understand.

805
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:44,043
If Iliana really was
transformed into a Bajoran,

806
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,878
then why did Entek
have me kidnapped?

807
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,714
Why not bring Iliana
back instead?

808
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:51,426
Because the desegranine
would have worked on Iliana.

809
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:53,219
Her memories
would have returned,

810
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,554
and she would have
cooperated with Entek.

811
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:58,475
But they knew
that you'd resist,

812
00:41:58,475 --> 00:41:59,851
and that I'd be forced

813
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:02,020
to try to get you
off of Cardassia.

814
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,314
Do you think Iliana's
still alive?

815
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:06,941
I have to.

816
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,110
I'm her father.

817
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:12,405
For all I know,
she's still on Bajor,

818
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:16,617
and someday,
I'll find her.

819
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:19,829
Are you sure you don't want
to stay on the station?

820
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:23,416
There's no place
for me here.

821
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,502
The Mathenite government

822
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:28,213
has offered me
political sanctuary.

823
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:30,673
I'll be safe there.

824
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:37,138
One more thing before I leave.

825
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:40,683
Can I give you
some fatherly advice?

826
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:43,144
For old times' sake.

827
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:44,729
Of course.

828
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:49,442
That Garak fellow who helped
you, who helped us,

829
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:51,610
don't trust him, Nerys,<i> ever.</i>

830
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,571
He's a dangerous man,

831
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,656
and he'd betray you and all
of your friends in an instant

832
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,450
if he thought
it would help him.

833
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:00,619
I'll keep my eye on him.

834
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:07,043
I suppose it's time to go.

835
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:11,339
Here.

836
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,341
It doesn't belong to me.

837
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:15,051
I can't keep it.

838
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,389
No.

839
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,893
I want you to have it.

840
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:28,064
You may not be my daughter,
but until I find Iliana,

841
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:31,526
you're the closest thing
I have to family.

842
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,198
I want you
to know something.

843
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:39,534
In spite of...

844
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:43,580
whatever I might have said,

845
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,998
I realize now...

846
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:49,335
you're an honorable man.

847
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:57,927
And I think your daughter
must have loved you very much.
