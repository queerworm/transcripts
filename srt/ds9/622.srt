1
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:04,997
How about it?

2
00:00:05,035 --> 00:00:07,028
Can I get some service please?

3
00:00:07,072 --> 00:00:08,404
How long's it take?

4
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:10,172
I've been waiting forever.

5
00:00:10,245 --> 00:00:12,215
This isn't what I wanted.

6
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,193
Having a bad day?

7
00:00:18,261 --> 00:00:20,527
Like you care.

8
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:23,129
Fizz, Froth, Flip,
Finial, Foam and Flare.

9
00:00:23,171 --> 00:00:25,164
What's going on
at that table anyway?

10
00:00:26,444 --> 00:00:29,975
I... take it there's a problem
with your drink replicator?

11
00:00:30,018 --> 00:00:31,715
A problem?

12
00:00:31,755 --> 00:00:34,556
No... can't be.

13
00:00:34,594 --> 00:00:37,157
If there were a problem,
I would have submitted

14
00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:39,727
an emergency maintenance request
this morning.

15
00:00:39,771 --> 00:00:41,866
And if I had done that

16
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:43,343
Chief O'Brien
would have assured me

17
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:45,906
that Rom would fix it
right away.

18
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,420
Then, of course,
Rom would have promised me

19
00:00:48,455 --> 00:00:51,222
that Nog would fix it
before the end of the day.

20
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:54,857
And since this is
the end of the day

21
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:56,734
and there is no Nog in sight

22
00:00:56,772 --> 00:00:59,174
we can only draw
one conclusion...

23
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,680
that I don't have a problem.

24
00:01:01,715 --> 00:01:03,412
Is your drink replicator
broken?

25
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:05,045
You're quick today.

26
00:01:05,088 --> 00:01:06,717
Do you want me
to fix it or not?

27
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:08,227
You?

28
00:01:08,328 --> 00:01:09,489
That's right.

29
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,523
Nog had a chance to take
a trip to Ferenginar

30
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:13,434
and I told him
that I would cover for him

31
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:14,439
while he was away.

32
00:01:14,473 --> 00:01:15,463
Why?

33
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,138
Because he did a favor

34
00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:19,581
for me last week, so I owe him.

35
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:21,247
But...

36
00:01:21,287 --> 00:01:26,093
that's work for a mechanic...
a repairman

37
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,257
a lowly engineer.

38
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,667
I'll tell Chief O'Brien
you said that.

39
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,472
Ugh...

40
00:01:34,313 --> 00:01:38,151
A supernova
and a Silven surprise.

41
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:41,459
She can't do this.

42
00:01:41,494 --> 00:01:42,689
Why not?

43
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:43,891
I...

44
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:45,903
It-it-it's not right.

45
00:01:45,937 --> 00:01:48,305
She's above
that sort of thing.

46
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:49,536
Those hands weren't meant

47
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:53,642
for poking around inside
some filthy drink replicator.

48
00:01:53,686 --> 00:01:56,214
They were meant
for higher pursuits.

49
00:01:57,226 --> 00:01:59,321
You're in love.

50
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:04,598
That's the most ridiculous thing
you've said this year.

51
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:06,109
Really?

52
00:02:06,143 --> 00:02:07,908
Really.

53
00:02:09,016 --> 00:02:12,216
It must kill you
that she's married to Worf.

54
00:02:12,256 --> 00:02:14,749
I don't know
what you're talking about.

55
00:02:14,794 --> 00:02:16,262
Hmm.

56
00:02:16,297 --> 00:02:18,529
And since you're not going
to order something

57
00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:21,699
would you please step aside
so that I can do my job?

58
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:23,302
Of course.

59
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:25,075
By the way, that's not
a Silven surprise.

60
00:02:25,115 --> 00:02:27,678
It's a silken sunrise.

61
00:02:50,432 --> 00:02:51,593
Is that it?

62
00:02:51,634 --> 00:02:52,897
That's right.

63
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:55,268
Hey, can I see it?

64
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,469
No.

65
00:02:57,914 --> 00:02:59,280
Nog.

66
00:02:59,316 --> 00:03:00,284
No.

67
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:02,015
It's an official
diplomatic message

68
00:03:02,055 --> 00:03:03,991
from the Federation Council
to the Grand Nagus.

69
00:03:04,026 --> 00:03:05,825
It's for his eyes only.

70
00:03:05,863 --> 00:03:07,297
Yeah, but you know what's in it.

71
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:08,425
Maybe.

72
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:10,529
It's a proposal for an alliance,
isn't it?

73
00:03:10,572 --> 00:03:13,339
I mean, the Federation sends
the only Ferengi in Starfleet

74
00:03:13,411 --> 00:03:15,881
to personally deliver
a diplomatic message

75
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,077
to the Grand Nagus?

76
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:18,713
Something big is up.

77
00:03:18,756 --> 00:03:21,523
You told me you weren't coming
on this trip as a reporter.

78
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,528
I'm not.

79
00:03:22,562 --> 00:03:24,532
I-I came to see Ferenginar.

80
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:25,966
I've heard a lot about it.

81
00:03:26,003 --> 00:03:28,064
I can't wait to see the-the rain

82
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:29,736
and-and the muck...

83
00:03:29,778 --> 00:03:31,338
Good.

84
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,977
Because while I'm delivering
the message to the Grand Nagus

85
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:35,886
you'll have plenty of time
to play tourist.

86
00:03:35,923 --> 00:03:39,556
<i>Shenandoah,</i>
this is Starbase 257.

87
00:03:39,596 --> 00:03:41,691
You've been cleared
to leave our defense perimeter.

88
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:45,003
Remain at one-half impulse until
you've passed the outer marker.

89
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,407
Acknowledged.

90
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:48,879
I don't get to see the Nagus?

91
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,409
Now why would you want
to see the Grand Nagus?

92
00:03:51,454 --> 00:03:53,822
My father told me to say hello.

93
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:54,827
A-a-and...

94
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:59,165
to... give the Nagus
his best wishes.

95
00:03:59,203 --> 00:04:01,105
You're going to have
to do better than that.

96
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,201
And...

97
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:06,182
because I told the editor
of the Federation News Service

98
00:04:06,217 --> 00:04:08,780
that I could get
an exclusive interview with Zek.

99
00:04:08,822 --> 00:04:09,847
Jake! You promised me

100
00:04:09,891 --> 00:04:11,861
you weren't coming along
as a reporter.

101
00:04:11,895 --> 00:04:13,728
I didn't promise, okay?

102
00:04:13,766 --> 00:04:15,599
I just sort of... you know?

103
00:04:18,307 --> 00:04:19,502
Okay, I promised

104
00:04:19,543 --> 00:04:21,809
but this could be
a really big story, Nog.

105
00:04:21,848 --> 00:04:23,784
The people have a right to know.

106
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:24,912
Forget it.

107
00:04:24,954 --> 00:04:27,186
You're not getting anywhere
near the Grand Nagus.

108
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,422
I have no further comments.

109
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,268
What's that?

110
00:04:32,302 --> 00:04:34,067
I'm not sure.

111
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:37,044
I'm having trouble
with our long-range scanners.

112
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:39,743
Looks like... our sensors
are being jammed.

113
00:04:42,924 --> 00:04:44,187
Uh-oh.

114
00:04:49,838 --> 00:04:51,535
Hang on.

115
00:04:58,187 --> 00:04:59,485
Where'd they come from?

116
00:04:59,523 --> 00:05:00,718
I don't know, but it looks

117
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,557
like they're heading
for the starbase.

118
00:05:02,596 --> 00:05:04,030
We're not sticking around,
are we?

119
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:05,261
Not in a runabout,
we're not.

120
00:05:05,301 --> 00:05:07,396
We're no match for a wing
of Jem'Hadar fighters.

121
00:05:11,915 --> 00:05:14,147
See if you can open a channel
to Deep Space 9.

122
00:05:15,321 --> 00:05:16,414
Something's wrong.

123
00:05:16,457 --> 00:05:18,654
I think they're jamming
our com system.

124
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:20,254
But why would they do that?

125
00:05:20,298 --> 00:05:22,963
Because one of them's
turned around

126
00:05:23,004 --> 00:05:25,474
and now he's coming after us.

127
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,941
You do realize you're taking us

128
00:07:36,978 --> 00:07:38,948
deeper and deeper
into Dominion-held space.

129
00:07:38,982 --> 00:07:40,280
We don't have much choice.

130
00:07:40,318 --> 00:07:42,788
Every time I try to change
course, they gain on us.

131
00:07:42,822 --> 00:07:44,290
They're gaining on us anyway.

132
00:07:44,326 --> 00:07:46,455
We might as well try and head
for the Federation.

133
00:07:46,497 --> 00:07:47,897
If we keep going
in this direction

134
00:07:47,932 --> 00:07:49,161
we'll run into Cardassia Prime

135
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,261
and that won't be
much fun at all.

136
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:51,272
Warning.

137
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:54,142
We are within range
of enemy weapons.

138
00:07:55,848 --> 00:07:57,784
Thanks for the warning.

139
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:00,586
All right, when I go to impulse,
raise the forward shields

140
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,686
and transfer auxiliary power
to the phasers.

141
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:04,323
We're dropping out of warp?

142
00:08:04,366 --> 00:08:06,598
If we have to fight,
I'd rather do it at impulse.

143
00:08:06,637 --> 00:08:08,732
At least we'd have an edge
in maneuverability.

144
00:08:08,774 --> 00:08:09,833
You're a Ferengi.

145
00:08:09,876 --> 00:08:11,470
Why don't you try
making a deal or something?

146
00:08:12,181 --> 00:08:13,649
It doesn't seem

147
00:08:13,684 --> 00:08:16,315
they're very interested
in talking.

148
00:08:16,356 --> 00:08:17,346
Stand by.

149
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,236
Here they come.

150
00:08:36,964 --> 00:08:38,627
Shields down 30 percent.

151
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:39,760
I see it.

152
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:42,798
We're losing main power!

153
00:08:42,842 --> 00:08:44,242
Keep the weapons on line.

154
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:47,251
Everything else is expendable,
including life support.

155
00:08:49,122 --> 00:08:54,429
There's another ship coming in,
bearing 170 mark 215.

156
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:56,095
Jem'Hadar or Cardassian?

157
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:57,604
It's, uh...

158
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,107
it's the <i>Defiant.</i>

159
00:08:59,142 --> 00:09:00,167
What?

160
00:09:03,217 --> 00:09:04,549
That's not the <i>Defiant.</i>

161
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,820
That ship's registry number
is NCC-74...

162
00:09:07,859 --> 00:09:09,556
210.

163
00:09:09,596 --> 00:09:10,928
USS <i>Valiant.</i>

164
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:13,060
<i>Valiant?</i>

165
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,297
Great name!

166
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:17,004
I hope they tear that Jem'Hadar
ship apart piece by...

167
00:09:19,816 --> 00:09:21,011
Jake.

168
00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:23,249
Jake!

169
00:09:32,642 --> 00:09:34,839
Are you all right, sir?

170
00:09:38,487 --> 00:09:40,081
Yeah.

171
00:09:40,124 --> 00:09:41,991
Uh...

172
00:09:42,027 --> 00:09:46,297
it's nothing serious...
Cadet, um...

173
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,702
Chief?

174
00:09:47,739 --> 00:09:50,073
Acting Chief Petty Officer
Dorian Collins.

175
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:51,079
The Captain's
asked me to escort

176
00:09:51,113 --> 00:09:52,081
you both to the Bridge.

177
00:09:52,115 --> 00:09:53,174
If you'll follow me.

178
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:58,384
Main power holding.

179
00:09:58,427 --> 00:09:59,588
Auxiliary power on standby.

180
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,131
Shields holding at 84 percent.

181
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:07,372
Helm, bring us about
to course 215 mark 310.

182
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:09,939
215 mark 310.
Aye, sir.

183
00:10:09,983 --> 00:10:13,319
Set quantum torpedo warheads
to maximum yield, full spread.

184
00:10:15,327 --> 00:10:18,128
Maximum yield, full spread.
Aye, sir.

185
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:21,568
Helm, initiate attack
pattern sierra-four.

186
00:10:21,606 --> 00:10:23,132
Sierra-four.
Aye, sir.

187
00:10:23,177 --> 00:10:24,806
Shields now at 78 percent.

188
00:10:24,846 --> 00:10:26,075
Transfer auxiliary power
to shields.

189
00:10:26,115 --> 00:10:27,208
This is Red Squad.

190
00:10:27,318 --> 00:10:28,786
Red Squad?

191
00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:30,916
It was a group of elite cadets
at the Academy.

192
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,484
They were...

193
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:34,191
the best of the best.

194
00:10:34,232 --> 00:10:35,929
Red Squad received
special training

195
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,804
special quarters,
special everything.

196
00:10:38,841 --> 00:10:40,002
They have their own ship?

197
00:10:40,043 --> 00:10:41,011
I've heard of cadets

198
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:43,949
getting command
of a runabout or a shuttle

199
00:10:43,984 --> 00:10:45,384
but not a starship.

200
00:10:49,896 --> 00:10:51,194
Fire.

201
00:10:58,881 --> 00:11:00,042
As you were.

202
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,113
This is the Captain.

203
00:11:03,155 --> 00:11:04,749
Stand down from Red Alert.

204
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:07,058
All stations submit damage
and casualty report

205
00:11:07,097 --> 00:11:08,691
to the First Officer.

206
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:12,674
Glad to see you made it
in one piece.

207
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,940
I'm Tim Watters,
Commanding Officer.

208
00:11:14,979 --> 00:11:16,174
Welcome aboard.

209
00:11:16,216 --> 00:11:17,776
Thank you... sir?

210
00:11:17,818 --> 00:11:19,150
"Sir" is correct, Ensign.

211
00:11:19,188 --> 00:11:21,090
I was given
a battlefield commission

212
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:24,029
and command of this vessel
by the late Captain Ramirez.

213
00:11:24,064 --> 00:11:26,534
Using that authority, I have
commissioned and promoted

214
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:28,539
other members of Red Squad
as needed.

215
00:11:29,575 --> 00:11:30,770
I see.

216
00:11:30,811 --> 00:11:33,281
Well, I'm Ensign Nog
and this is Jake Sisko.

217
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,818
We're from Deep Space 9.

218
00:11:34,852 --> 00:11:35,945
Sisko.

219
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:37,719
You're Benjamin Sisko's son.

220
00:11:37,758 --> 00:11:39,489
That's right.

221
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:41,692
Ah, I've heard a lot
about your father.

222
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:44,135
I see you're not following
in his footsteps.

223
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:46,539
No. I'm a reporter.

224
00:11:46,576 --> 00:11:48,136
You should really get
that looked at. Chief?

225
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:49,306
Sir?

226
00:11:49,349 --> 00:11:50,817
Escort Mr. Sisko to Sick Bay.

227
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:52,012
Aye, Captain.

228
00:11:52,053 --> 00:11:53,316
This way, sir.

229
00:11:53,357 --> 00:11:55,691
Preliminary damage report, sir.

230
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:57,459
Oh, thank you.

231
00:11:57,498 --> 00:11:59,991
Ensign Nog, Commander Karen
Farris, our First Officer.

232
00:12:00,036 --> 00:12:01,630
Commander.

233
00:12:01,673 --> 00:12:02,641
Ensign.

234
00:12:02,675 --> 00:12:05,272
Sir, the Engine Room
also reports

235
00:12:05,347 --> 00:12:07,283
that we still have power spikes
cropping up all through

236
00:12:07,385 --> 00:12:09,378
the deuterium injector
start-up routine.

237
00:12:09,422 --> 00:12:11,517
I thought we had that
under control.

238
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,891
I did, too, sir.

239
00:12:12,928 --> 00:12:15,866
Have you recalibrated the
lateral impulse control system?

240
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,530
No.

241
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,734
What does that have to do
with the injectors?

242
00:12:19,776 --> 00:12:22,942
Well, the impulse system shares
some of the same power relays

243
00:12:22,982 --> 00:12:24,975
used in the injector start-up
routine.

244
00:12:26,221 --> 00:12:27,211
We'll try it.

245
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,196
Mr. Nog, why don't you wait
in my ready room.

246
00:12:31,231 --> 00:12:32,324
Yes, sir.

247
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,906
The training cruise was
supposed to last three months.

248
00:12:35,941 --> 00:12:39,745
We had seven regular officers
and a crew of 35 cadets.

249
00:12:39,782 --> 00:12:41,945
The plan was for the cadets
to run the ship

250
00:12:41,986 --> 00:12:44,651
while the officers observed
and critiqued our performance.

251
00:12:44,692 --> 00:12:47,528
So, uh, this was
a training ship?

252
00:12:47,565 --> 00:12:49,056
Like the other one, the, um...

253
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,037
uh... the <i>Republic.</i>

254
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,631
Not quite.

255
00:12:52,675 --> 00:12:54,372
The <i>Republic's</i> an old ship.

256
00:12:54,412 --> 00:12:57,316
I don't think she's left
the Terran system in 50 years.

257
00:12:59,121 --> 00:13:01,786
The <i>Valiant's</i>
a state-of-the-art warship.

258
00:13:01,826 --> 00:13:03,489
Our mission was
to circumnavigate

259
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,830
the entire Federation
before returning home.

260
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,499
The entire Federation?

261
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,669
With a ship of cadets?

262
00:13:10,711 --> 00:13:14,242
Not just cadets, Mr. Sisko.

263
00:13:14,284 --> 00:13:16,345
Red Squad cadets.

264
00:13:16,456 --> 00:13:19,292
We were transiting the Kepla
Sector when war broke out.

265
00:13:19,328 --> 00:13:21,093
As you probably know,
a Dominion invasion force

266
00:13:21,131 --> 00:13:23,294
swept through that sector
on the first day.

267
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,704
So you were caught
behind enemy lines.

268
00:13:25,741 --> 00:13:27,004
Correct.

269
00:13:27,043 --> 00:13:29,844
We were trying to make our way
back to Federation-held space

270
00:13:29,882 --> 00:13:33,879
when we encountered a Cardassian
battle cruiser near El Gatark.

271
00:13:33,924 --> 00:13:36,053
That was our first taste
of combat.

272
00:13:36,094 --> 00:13:37,654
In the first 15 minutes

273
00:13:37,698 --> 00:13:39,895
four regular officers
were killed.

274
00:13:39,936 --> 00:13:42,406
Three others were
critically wounded

275
00:13:42,441 --> 00:13:44,001
including Captain Ramirez.

276
00:13:44,044 --> 00:13:46,572
Is that when you took command?

277
00:13:46,616 --> 00:13:48,050
No.

278
00:13:48,085 --> 00:13:49,314
When I got to the Bridge

279
00:13:49,355 --> 00:13:51,154
the Captain was
in pretty bad shape

280
00:13:51,191 --> 00:13:52,216
but he was lucid

281
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,423
and he refused
to go to Sick Bay.

282
00:13:54,465 --> 00:13:58,769
We had lost main power
and we were adrift

283
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:01,540
but the Cardassian cruiser
was no better off.

284
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:03,378
So it was a race
against the clock...

285
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,852
ship that got main power
back on line first

286
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:09,087
would have a decisive advantage.

287
00:14:11,566 --> 00:14:14,834
The... the Captain, he...

288
00:14:14,872 --> 00:14:16,808
he was amazing.

289
00:14:16,843 --> 00:14:19,279
He directed
the entire damage-control effort

290
00:14:19,314 --> 00:14:22,582
with a punctured lung
and massive internal injuries.

291
00:14:22,621 --> 00:14:24,614
He was a great man.

292
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:27,893
And he won the race.

293
00:14:27,931 --> 00:14:30,562
We got weapons
and impulse engines

294
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:32,801
back on line in three hours.

295
00:14:32,841 --> 00:14:34,399
And then we destroyed
that Cardie ship.

296
00:14:34,532 --> 00:14:37,265
The next day,
just before he died

297
00:14:37,304 --> 00:14:41,267
the Captain ordered me
to take command of the <i>Valiant.</i>

298
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,015
It's unbelievable!

299
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:47,991
You've spent eight months
behind enemy lines.

300
00:14:49,328 --> 00:14:51,059
I didn't do it alone.

301
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,829
The crew deserves
the real credit.

302
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:55,337
We have cadets here
as young as 17

303
00:14:55,373 --> 00:14:58,140
who are doing the job
of officers twice their age.

304
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:00,649
But we're also seriously
undermanned.

305
00:15:03,222 --> 00:15:04,748
I could use another officer.

306
00:15:06,061 --> 00:15:08,531
I'd be happy to do
whatever I can, sir.

307
00:15:08,567 --> 00:15:09,557
I see you're familiar

308
00:15:09,602 --> 00:15:11,731
with the operations
of a class-7 warp drive.

309
00:15:11,773 --> 00:15:12,798
Very familiar, sir.

310
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,243
The <i>Defiant</i> has
an identical engine.

311
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,248
Excellent.

312
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,979
As of this moment,
you are Chief Engineer.

313
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:19,453
Congratulations.

314
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:20,752
Chief Engineer?

315
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,454
With rank
of Lieutenant Commander.

316
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:23,963
Your first assignment
is to figure out

317
00:15:23,997 --> 00:15:26,525
why we can't go above warp 3.2.

318
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,560
Mr. Parton believes that...

319
00:15:27,605 --> 00:15:29,165
Excuse me, sir...

320
00:15:29,207 --> 00:15:31,268
I-I don't think
I'm ready for this...

321
00:15:31,312 --> 00:15:32,644
None of us were ready

322
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,779
for the responsibility
thrust upon us, Commander

323
00:15:35,821 --> 00:15:39,260
but each of us found a way
to rise to the occasion...

324
00:15:39,294 --> 00:15:41,093
do the job that had to be done.

325
00:15:41,131 --> 00:15:45,732
Ready or not...
you are Chief Engineer.

326
00:15:47,043 --> 00:15:48,341
You can do this, Mr. Nog.

327
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:51,510
Just have faith in yourself,
faith in your shipmates

328
00:15:51,553 --> 00:15:53,284
and everything'll be fine.

329
00:16:01,338 --> 00:16:02,601
Yes, sir.

330
00:16:02,642 --> 00:16:03,610
I will, sir.

331
00:16:03,644 --> 00:16:04,612
Good man.

332
00:16:04,646 --> 00:16:06,343
That's what I want to hear.

333
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,582
Now, if you can just fix
our warp drive problems

334
00:16:09,622 --> 00:16:11,683
we can get on with our mission.

335
00:16:12,728 --> 00:16:14,196
Our mission?

336
00:16:14,231 --> 00:16:15,529
I don't understand.

337
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:17,696
My orders are to collect
technical data

338
00:16:17,738 --> 00:16:20,801
on a new Dominion battleship
operating in this sector.

339
00:16:20,844 --> 00:16:23,543
We keep picking up
their com traffic

340
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,212
so we know they're in the area

341
00:16:25,253 --> 00:16:28,350
but because we can't go faster
than warp 3.2

342
00:16:28,392 --> 00:16:30,259
we're unable to get
within sensor range.

343
00:16:30,296 --> 00:16:34,100
And Starfleet knows you're
in command of the <i>Valiant.</i>

344
00:16:34,137 --> 00:16:35,332
No.

345
00:16:35,373 --> 00:16:37,741
We've had to maintain
strict radio silence

346
00:16:37,778 --> 00:16:39,873
ever since the war began.

347
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,409
The orders were addressed
to Captain Ramirez.

348
00:16:42,454 --> 00:16:46,019
But since he's dead,
the mission's now mine.

349
00:16:47,263 --> 00:16:51,135
Make no mistake,
I will carry out that mission.

350
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:52,537
Or die trying.

351
00:16:59,822 --> 00:17:01,085
Dismissed.

352
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:22,693
Coffee?

353
00:17:22,735 --> 00:17:24,135
Uh, <i>raktajino,</i> please.

354
00:17:36,563 --> 00:17:37,929
Here you go.

355
00:17:37,965 --> 00:17:39,058
Thanks.

356
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:44,835
So, where are you from?

357
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,548
Me?

358
00:17:48,452 --> 00:17:49,715
Tycho City.

359
00:17:49,755 --> 00:17:52,157
Oh, a Lunar Schooner.

360
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,727
I haven't heard that
in a long time.

361
00:17:55,767 --> 00:17:58,637
Yeah. Picked it up
from my granddad.

362
00:17:58,673 --> 00:18:00,836
Of course, he still calls
Luna "the moon"...

363
00:18:00,878 --> 00:18:02,745
like it's the only one
or something.

364
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,946
Well, nobody who's
ever lived on the moon

365
00:18:06,054 --> 00:18:07,283
calls it Luna either.

366
00:18:07,323 --> 00:18:08,986
That's just something
they say on Earth.

367
00:18:09,996 --> 00:18:11,055
So, what's it like?

368
00:18:11,098 --> 00:18:12,624
You're from Earth, aren't you?

369
00:18:13,803 --> 00:18:15,602
You've never been to the moon?

370
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:18,306
Just never got around to it.

371
00:18:18,345 --> 00:18:19,677
Tell me about it.

372
00:18:21,719 --> 00:18:25,989
Well... people say
it's so barren and harsh

373
00:18:26,061 --> 00:18:29,831
but... it's not.

374
00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:32,568
It's... beautiful.

375
00:18:32,607 --> 00:18:34,440
I mean, Tycho City's just a city

376
00:18:34,477 --> 00:18:37,278
but outside, where
the gravity is still low

377
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:38,683
and there's no air...

378
00:18:40,556 --> 00:18:43,824
You know, the sun only comes up
once a month on the moon.

379
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:49,699
Every lunar morning, my father
and I would put on suits and...

380
00:18:49,742 --> 00:18:52,509
hike out
across the Sea of Clouds.

381
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:57,050
We'd stop at this collection
of boulders on the western rim

382
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:01,531
and... just wait
for the sun to come up.

383
00:19:04,571 --> 00:19:08,944
Dawn is so...
shocking on the moon.

384
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,506
One minute, you're

385
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,019
in the darkest night
you can imagine

386
00:19:13,122 --> 00:19:15,456
and the next instant,
the sun lifts up

387
00:19:15,493 --> 00:19:19,331
and this... glorious pure light

388
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:23,239
just... explodes
across the surface.

389
00:19:27,016 --> 00:19:29,350
I felt
like I met God every morning.

390
00:19:33,262 --> 00:19:35,027
I'm on duty.
Excuse me.

391
00:19:37,603 --> 00:19:39,470
What's your solution,
Commander?

392
00:19:39,507 --> 00:19:42,274
I've taken the safeties
off the plasma intercooler

393
00:19:42,313 --> 00:19:45,183
the flux moderator
and the pressure-control system.

394
00:19:45,219 --> 00:19:46,414
That should
solve the problem.

395
00:19:46,455 --> 00:19:47,650
You do realize
you're violating

396
00:19:47,691 --> 00:19:49,820
about 50 safety regulations?

397
00:19:49,862 --> 00:19:51,353
Yes, sir, I do

398
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,924
but I also know
Chief O'Brien made

399
00:19:52,968 --> 00:19:54,436
the same changes to the <i>Defiant.</i>

400
00:19:54,471 --> 00:19:55,997
She never had a problem.

401
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,102
I don't know, Captain.

402
00:19:58,178 --> 00:19:59,807
This seems kind of risky to me.

403
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:01,580
Mr. Parton?

404
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:04,954
After spending seven months
plodding along at warp 3.2

405
00:20:04,992 --> 00:20:07,121
I'm willing
to try anything, sir.

406
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,368
Watters to Bridge.
Prepare for warp speed.

407
00:20:11,404 --> 00:20:12,429
Aye, sir.

408
00:20:12,473 --> 00:20:15,411
All right, Mr. Nog,
take us to warp 4.

409
00:20:43,235 --> 00:20:44,533
Can I help you, sir?

410
00:20:44,571 --> 00:20:45,766
No.

411
00:20:45,807 --> 00:20:47,333
No, I've got it.

412
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,213
Any problems with Sisko's arm?

413
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:52,845
No, sir.

414
00:21:00,102 --> 00:21:02,265
You got a problem, Chief?

415
00:21:02,306 --> 00:21:03,467
No, sir.

416
00:21:07,884 --> 00:21:09,079
Have you been crying?

417
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:13,188
A little.

418
00:21:13,262 --> 00:21:14,389
About what?

419
00:21:15,934 --> 00:21:18,701
I was... just...

420
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:20,936
thinking about home.

421
00:21:30,362 --> 00:21:31,387
Come in.

422
00:21:31,431 --> 00:21:34,335
Chief, I think you can go now.

423
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,360
Thank you, sir.

424
00:21:47,358 --> 00:21:50,592
Well, Mr. Sisko,
sounds like you and the Chief

425
00:21:50,631 --> 00:21:52,999
had quite a conversation
this afternoon.

426
00:21:53,036 --> 00:21:55,336
Home and family

427
00:21:55,374 --> 00:21:57,606
and the glories
of dawn on the moon.

428
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,309
Does that just about cover it?

429
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,786
Yeah, that's, uh...
that's about it.

430
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:04,155
What's going on?

431
00:22:04,192 --> 00:22:06,959
What's going on, Mr. Sisko,
in case you haven't noticed

432
00:22:06,997 --> 00:22:09,160
is that we are
in the middle of a war.

433
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,192
We can't afford to have

434
00:22:10,237 --> 00:22:11,900
young cadets thinking
about mommy and daddy

435
00:22:11,941 --> 00:22:13,273
when they need
to be concentrating

436
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,437
on their duties.

437
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:15,674
All I did was ask
about her home.

438
00:22:15,714 --> 00:22:16,943
All you did

439
00:22:16,984 --> 00:22:20,150
was plunge a member of this crew
into emotional turmoil.

440
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,887
Jake...

441
00:22:21,927 --> 00:22:24,295
May I call you Jake?

442
00:22:26,035 --> 00:22:28,164
You're a reporter.

443
00:22:28,206 --> 00:22:30,369
Your job is to watch
the way events unfold

444
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:31,878
not participate in them.

445
00:22:31,914 --> 00:22:33,747
Right now, you need
to stand back.

446
00:22:33,783 --> 00:22:35,217
Take a look at where you are...

447
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:36,552
what's going on around you.

448
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:38,889
You're right in the middle
of a great story...

449
00:22:38,928 --> 00:22:40,898
maybe one
of the greatest stories

450
00:22:40,932 --> 00:22:42,629
in the entire Dominion war.

451
00:22:46,776 --> 00:22:49,339
This ship is special, Jake.

452
00:22:49,382 --> 00:22:51,750
This crew is special.

453
00:22:51,786 --> 00:22:53,779
And whatever fates
guide this universe

454
00:22:53,823 --> 00:22:57,159
they've chosen us to achieve
some purpose in this conflict.

455
00:22:57,197 --> 00:22:58,290
I know that.

456
00:22:58,333 --> 00:22:59,824
Just as surely as I know

457
00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:02,362
your presence on this ship
is no coincidence.

458
00:23:02,408 --> 00:23:04,002
You're here to write the story...

459
00:23:04,111 --> 00:23:06,912
to tell people
of the <i>Valiant</i> and her crew.

460
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,114
Don't interfere
with the story, Jake.

461
00:23:10,157 --> 00:23:12,218
Don't become a part of it.

462
00:23:12,261 --> 00:23:14,231
Just let it unfold around you.

463
00:23:14,265 --> 00:23:16,030
Observe, listen

464
00:23:16,102 --> 00:23:18,265
and then write it down.

465
00:23:18,306 --> 00:23:21,939
May I have your word you'll stay
away from Chief Collins?

466
00:23:26,022 --> 00:23:27,354
Okay.

467
00:23:27,391 --> 00:23:29,020
Thank you, Jake.

468
00:23:29,061 --> 00:23:31,031
You're dismissed.

469
00:23:37,911 --> 00:23:40,177
I'm not sure we can trust him.

470
00:23:40,217 --> 00:23:41,743
We'll keep an eye on him.

471
00:23:41,786 --> 00:23:43,983
What about Mr. Nog?

472
00:23:44,025 --> 00:23:46,086
Mr. Nog wears a uniform.

473
00:23:46,129 --> 00:23:47,495
He'll do his duty.

474
00:23:47,531 --> 00:23:50,526
All right.
That'll be all, Commander.

475
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,936
I'll see you at 1800 hours.

476
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:52,964
Yes, sir.

477
00:23:58,853 --> 00:24:00,379
Captain

478
00:24:00,424 --> 00:24:01,858
are you all right?

479
00:24:01,893 --> 00:24:04,261
Yes. Why?

480
00:24:04,298 --> 00:24:05,664
I heard you were on the Bridge

481
00:24:05,701 --> 00:24:07,637
during midwatch
again last night.

482
00:24:07,671 --> 00:24:10,370
You haven't been getting
much sleep lately, sir.

483
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,004
None of us have, Commander.

484
00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:15,349
No, sir, I suppose not.

485
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:19,724
Thank you
for your concern, Karen...

486
00:24:19,762 --> 00:24:23,600
but I'm... I'm fine, really.

487
00:24:24,638 --> 00:24:25,867
Yes, sir.

488
00:24:25,907 --> 00:24:27,398
I'm sorry I even brought it up.

489
00:24:27,444 --> 00:24:29,175
That's all right.

490
00:25:04,985 --> 00:25:06,078
Where've you been?

491
00:25:06,122 --> 00:25:07,283
Engine Room.

492
00:25:07,324 --> 00:25:09,123
I solved their warp problem.

493
00:25:09,161 --> 00:25:10,824
What's that?

494
00:25:10,864 --> 00:25:12,561
My Red Squad insignia.

495
00:25:12,601 --> 00:25:14,127
Oh, and in case
you haven't noticed

496
00:25:14,238 --> 00:25:15,638
this would be my new rank...

497
00:25:15,674 --> 00:25:18,144
Lieutenant Commander Nog,
Chief Engineer.

498
00:25:18,213 --> 00:25:20,683
It has a nice ring to it,
don't you think?

499
00:25:20,717 --> 00:25:21,742
You joined the crew?

500
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,152
Something wrong with that?

501
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,487
It's a little fast.

502
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:25,788
We just got here
and Watters puts you

503
00:25:25,827 --> 00:25:27,022
in charge of the Engine Room?

504
00:25:27,064 --> 00:25:29,934
Captain Watters is used
to making quick decisions.

505
00:25:29,969 --> 00:25:33,169
He felt I was the right man
for the job, so he promoted me.

506
00:25:33,209 --> 00:25:34,177
Red Alert.

507
00:25:34,211 --> 00:25:36,408
All hands to battle stations.

508
00:25:36,449 --> 00:25:38,282
I repeat, all hands
to battle stations.

509
00:25:40,924 --> 00:25:43,326
Range: 1.32 light-years.

510
00:25:43,363 --> 00:25:45,333
Speed: Warp 4.7.

511
00:25:45,367 --> 00:25:47,200
What's going on?

512
00:25:47,304 --> 00:25:49,706
We found our battleship.

513
00:25:49,742 --> 00:25:53,010
Their course is 170 mark 135.

514
00:25:53,048 --> 00:25:55,041
Speed: Warp 3.97.

515
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:56,817
Bridge to phaser control.

516
00:25:56,856 --> 00:25:58,347
You've got a spike
in the 3-L subsystem.

517
00:25:58,393 --> 00:25:59,486
Take care of it.

518
00:25:59,528 --> 00:26:02,557
Sensors show a drop
in gamma radiation...

519
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:04,264
...is losing power.
- I'll reroute

520
00:26:04,305 --> 00:26:05,705
at the auxiliary
power interface.

521
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,106
They've changed course.

522
00:26:07,144 --> 00:26:08,510
Any sign they've detected us?

523
00:26:08,546 --> 00:26:09,605
Negative.

524
00:26:09,648 --> 00:26:11,174
I think we're still
outside their sensor range.

525
00:26:11,218 --> 00:26:12,186
Maintain your distance, Helm.

526
00:26:12,254 --> 00:26:13,483
Match their course and speed.

527
00:26:13,523 --> 00:26:14,548
Aye, sir.

528
00:26:14,591 --> 00:26:16,185
Prepare a class-3 probe
for launch.

529
00:26:16,262 --> 00:26:17,628
Aye, sir.

530
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:20,131
What happens now?

531
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,731
We're going to launch
a sensor probe

532
00:26:23,776 --> 00:26:24,937
to scan the battleship.

533
00:26:24,979 --> 00:26:27,040
That way, the <i>Valiant</i>
won't be picked up

534
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:28,051
on their scanners.

535
00:26:28,085 --> 00:26:30,055
Won't they detect a probe?

536
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,992
Class-3 probes
are designed to be

537
00:26:32,026 --> 00:26:33,324
virtually undetectable.

538
00:26:33,363 --> 00:26:35,731
There's almost no chance
of it being spotted.

539
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:36,928
Almost?

540
00:26:36,969 --> 00:26:40,271
I don't remember anyone
inviting you to the Bridge.

541
00:26:46,455 --> 00:26:50,589
Captain's Log, Stardate 51825.4.

542
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,497
We've been shadowing
the Dominion battleship

543
00:26:52,534 --> 00:26:53,627
for three hours.

544
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:55,263
The data our probe
has gathered so far

545
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,276
has not only been interesting

546
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,280
but it may have given us
a golden opportunity

547
00:26:59,381 --> 00:27:01,442
to strike a blow
for the Federation.

548
00:27:01,485 --> 00:27:03,045
Attention on deck!

549
00:27:06,295 --> 00:27:07,627
Stand at ease.

550
00:27:11,639 --> 00:27:12,868
It's been a long eight months...

551
00:27:12,908 --> 00:27:15,607
a lot of hard work,
a lot of sacrifice.

552
00:27:15,647 --> 00:27:18,140
And now we've accomplished
our mission.

553
00:27:18,186 --> 00:27:21,181
We found the battleship
and obtained a complete scan

554
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:23,092
without being detected...

555
00:27:23,128 --> 00:27:24,825
and we're free to go home.

556
00:27:26,402 --> 00:27:30,843
But that ship out there
is a direct threat

557
00:27:30,877 --> 00:27:33,440
to every Federation outpost
and colony

558
00:27:33,483 --> 00:27:35,282
within 50 light-years.

559
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,021
That ship must be destroyed.

560
00:27:43,402 --> 00:27:45,565
It can be destroyed.

561
00:27:46,575 --> 00:27:47,543
Commander?

562
00:27:47,577 --> 00:27:50,276
We found a flaw in the design

563
00:27:50,316 --> 00:27:52,786
of their antimatter
storage system.

564
00:27:52,821 --> 00:27:56,921
The primary support braces
are made of viterium.

565
00:27:56,962 --> 00:27:59,593
It's a very strong,
very resilient metal alloy

566
00:27:59,635 --> 00:28:02,232
which just happens to become
extremely unstable

567
00:28:02,274 --> 00:28:04,744
when exposed to delta radiation.

568
00:28:04,778 --> 00:28:07,214
A single torpedo, rigged
with a radiogenic warhead

569
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,279
could reduce those braces
to the consistency of wet pasta.

570
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:11,916
As a result, the entire

571
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:15,420
antimatter storage system
would tear itself apart.

572
00:28:16,835 --> 00:28:18,201
Commander Nog.

573
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:19,605
You don't seem convinced.

574
00:28:21,745 --> 00:28:24,740
Well, sir, in-in order
to rig a torpedo

575
00:28:24,785 --> 00:28:27,153
to yield a delta radiation burst

576
00:28:27,189 --> 00:28:29,786
I'll have to remove
most of the guidance systems.

577
00:28:29,828 --> 00:28:31,661
We'll have
to target it manually.

578
00:28:31,699 --> 00:28:33,669
We've trained
for that possibility.

579
00:28:33,703 --> 00:28:35,798
It shouldn't be a problem.

580
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,208
We'll also have to get
very close to the target.

581
00:28:38,246 --> 00:28:39,646
How close?

582
00:28:41,385 --> 00:28:43,355
Within 300 meters.

583
00:28:46,845 --> 00:28:49,338
It's dangerous,
there's no disputing that.

584
00:28:49,384 --> 00:28:51,183
And no one would think
any less of us

585
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,917
if we just turn around
and go home.

586
00:28:52,957 --> 00:28:54,050
But that means

587
00:28:54,093 --> 00:28:56,963
that some other ship
with some other crew

588
00:28:56,999 --> 00:28:59,971
would be asked to finish the job
that we started.

589
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:01,770
I think we can do it.

590
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:05,915
I think we should do it.

591
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:11,024
Can I say something?

592
00:29:11,127 --> 00:29:13,461
You are not a member
of this crew.

593
00:29:13,499 --> 00:29:15,128
Let him speak.

594
00:29:16,638 --> 00:29:19,371
You all probably know
who my father is.

595
00:29:19,411 --> 00:29:20,606
Benjamin Sisko?

596
00:29:20,646 --> 00:29:24,245
So you know I'm not exaggerating
when I say that he's considered

597
00:29:24,287 --> 00:29:27,020
to be one of the best
combat officers in the fleet

598
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:29,587
and I'm telling you right now

599
00:29:29,631 --> 00:29:32,762
that even with the entire crew
of the <i>Defiant</i> with him

600
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:36,938
my father would never try
to pull off something like this.

601
00:29:36,978 --> 00:29:40,850
And if he can't do it,
it can't be done.

602
00:29:40,886 --> 00:29:44,917
We're Red Squad
and we can do anything.

603
00:29:44,961 --> 00:29:46,088
Yeah! Red Squad!

604
00:29:46,163 --> 00:29:48,190
Red Squad! Red Squad!

605
00:29:48,234 --> 00:29:49,965
Red Squad!
Red Squad!

606
00:29:50,004 --> 00:29:52,805
Red Squad! Red Squad!
Red Squad! Red Squad!

607
00:29:52,844 --> 00:29:56,545
Red Squad! Red Squad! Red Squad!

608
00:29:56,585 --> 00:29:58,885
Red Squad! Red Squad!
Red Squad!

609
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,254
Red Squad! Red Squad!

610
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:02,819
Red Squad! Red Squad!
Red Squad!

611
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:08,101
This is suicide.

612
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:10,373
No. It's not.

613
00:30:10,412 --> 00:30:11,573
Nog, listen to me.

614
00:30:11,615 --> 00:30:14,017
We're in
way over our heads here.

615
00:30:14,052 --> 00:30:15,612
Now, someone told me
that ship out there

616
00:30:15,656 --> 00:30:17,751
is twice the size
of a Galaxy-class ship

617
00:30:17,794 --> 00:30:19,593
and three times as strong.

618
00:30:19,631 --> 00:30:21,157
That's accurate.

619
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,965
And you really think we can go
up against a ship like that?

620
00:30:23,004 --> 00:30:24,906
I think
that Captain Watters knows

621
00:30:24,941 --> 00:30:25,909
what he's doing.

622
00:30:25,943 --> 00:30:27,070
Oh, really?

623
00:30:27,112 --> 00:30:30,573
Well, uh, did you know
that Watters has been taking

624
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:32,816
cordafin stimulants
for the past two months?

625
00:30:32,857 --> 00:30:34,018
Where did you hear that?

626
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:35,118
Dorian told me.

627
00:30:35,161 --> 00:30:37,154
You were ordered
to stay away from her.

628
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:38,565
Watters to Shepard.

629
00:30:38,602 --> 00:30:40,196
Please report
to my ready room, Lieutenant.

630
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,504
That's not the way we do
things in Starfleet.

631
00:30:43,311 --> 00:30:44,210
I can't believe

632
00:30:44,313 --> 00:30:46,180
you're buying everything
that Watters is selling.

633
00:30:46,217 --> 00:30:48,585
He's not selling anything.

634
00:30:48,622 --> 00:30:50,649
He's reminding us of our duty.

635
00:30:50,693 --> 00:30:52,890
I feel like
I'm having a conversation

636
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,559
with one of the bulkheads.

637
00:30:55,836 --> 00:30:56,963
You don't understand

638
00:30:57,005 --> 00:30:59,841
because you've never put on
one of these uniforms.

639
00:30:59,878 --> 00:31:03,579
You don't know anything
about sacrifice or honor

640
00:31:03,619 --> 00:31:07,457
or duty or any other things
that make up a soldier's life.

641
00:31:07,493 --> 00:31:11,024
I'm part of something
larger than myself.

642
00:31:11,066 --> 00:31:13,559
All you care about is you.

643
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:15,039
That's right.

644
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:16,634
All I care about is Jake Sisko

645
00:31:16,678 --> 00:31:18,078
and whether or not he's going
to be killed

646
00:31:18,114 --> 00:31:19,207
by a bunch
of delusional fanatics

647
00:31:19,316 --> 00:31:20,682
looking for martyrdom.

648
00:31:21,821 --> 00:31:23,450
Get out.

649
00:31:25,829 --> 00:31:27,526
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

650
00:31:27,566 --> 00:31:31,233
I'm the Chief Engineer
of the Starship <i>Valiant.</i>

651
00:31:32,242 --> 00:31:34,770
I'll have them put that
on your tombstone.

652
00:31:47,974 --> 00:31:49,944
Mr. Sisko!

653
00:31:49,978 --> 00:31:52,141
I'm afraid you'll have
to miss all the fun.

654
00:31:52,182 --> 00:31:54,949
You're going to spend the rest
of this mission in the brig.

655
00:32:52,035 --> 00:32:54,437
All decks report ready, sir.

656
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:56,671
This is the Captain.

657
00:33:01,554 --> 00:33:04,219
We are about to engage
the enemy.

658
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:06,822
For the last eight months

659
00:33:06,865 --> 00:33:09,769
I've told you to stay
focused on one thing...

660
00:33:09,804 --> 00:33:11,102
your duty.

661
00:33:12,342 --> 00:33:14,676
But now I want you
to step back from your duty

662
00:33:14,714 --> 00:33:16,479
and take a look around

663
00:33:16,518 --> 00:33:18,647
and I don't mean
look at the walls.

664
00:33:18,688 --> 00:33:21,421
I want you to look
at this moment in your life.

665
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,485
Take it in.

666
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:24,261
Appreciate the fact
that you are on this ship

667
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:28,672
with this group of people,
at this point in history.

668
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:32,044
But understand one thing
above all else.

669
00:33:32,081 --> 00:33:35,178
This moment
will never come again.

670
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,689
Hold on to it.

671
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:38,717
Savor it for as long as you can.

672
00:33:38,762 --> 00:33:41,825
You're Starfleet,
you're Red Squad

673
00:33:41,868 --> 00:33:43,359
and you're the best.

674
00:33:45,576 --> 00:33:48,012
Now...

675
00:33:48,047 --> 00:33:51,019
let's get that battleship
and we can all go home.

676
00:33:51,053 --> 00:33:52,647
Captain out.

677
00:33:53,725 --> 00:33:54,920
All right then.

678
00:33:54,961 --> 00:33:56,555
Good luck.

679
00:33:58,602 --> 00:34:01,004
Take us to warp 6, Mr. Nog.

680
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,268
Warp six.

681
00:34:02,308 --> 00:34:03,298
Aye.

682
00:34:15,334 --> 00:34:16,393
They've spotted us.

683
00:34:17,873 --> 00:34:19,136
They're dropping out of warp.

684
00:34:19,175 --> 00:34:20,575
Helm, go to impulse.

685
00:34:20,612 --> 00:34:21,739
Aye, sir.

686
00:34:21,781 --> 00:34:23,113
We are in visual range.

687
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,413
On screen.

688
00:34:51,073 --> 00:34:53,236
Lay in a strafing course
along their superstructure

689
00:34:53,277 --> 00:34:54,404
and make it close.

690
00:34:54,446 --> 00:34:56,348
That way, they won't get
a weapons lock on us.

691
00:34:56,383 --> 00:34:58,376
I want to scrape some paint
off their hull, Lieutenant.

692
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,445
Aye, sir.

693
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:02,221
Raise shields, charge phasers,
fire at any targets

694
00:35:02,261 --> 00:35:03,524
of opportunity as we pass.

695
00:35:03,564 --> 00:35:04,532
Aye, sir.

696
00:35:04,566 --> 00:35:05,499
Torpedo status?

697
00:35:05,534 --> 00:35:06,763
Torpedoes ready, sir.

698
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:08,033
Defense system ready.

699
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:09,166
Helm ready.

700
00:35:10,177 --> 00:35:13,445
All right, Mr. Shepard,
take us in.

701
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,705
Shields holding.

702
00:35:27,746 --> 00:35:29,943
Course stable.

703
00:35:29,984 --> 00:35:30,952
Fire at will!

704
00:35:39,169 --> 00:35:40,968
Helm! Hard about!

705
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:42,600
Tactical, get a target lock
on those braces!

706
00:35:48,977 --> 00:35:51,209
Impulse engines at full thrust.

707
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:54,084
They're trying
to jam our sensors.

708
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:55,954
Mr. Nog, initiate
countermeasures.

709
00:35:56,025 --> 00:35:57,084
I'm on it!

710
00:35:57,127 --> 00:35:58,756
I've acquired the target.

711
00:36:00,466 --> 00:36:02,129
Torpedoes locked!

712
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:04,299
Full power to forward shields.

713
00:36:04,341 --> 00:36:07,074
Helm, plot an escape course
down the z-axis.

714
00:36:07,113 --> 00:36:08,138
Ready.

715
00:36:08,182 --> 00:36:09,081
Engage.

716
00:36:14,127 --> 00:36:15,095
They're turning to port.

717
00:36:15,129 --> 00:36:16,119
Match them, Helm.

718
00:36:16,165 --> 00:36:17,428
Keep us on track.

719
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:18,935
Aye, sir.

720
00:36:18,971 --> 00:36:20,804
Hull breach on Deck Two.

721
00:36:20,841 --> 00:36:23,107
Emergency force-fields
are in place.

722
00:36:24,648 --> 00:36:26,116
Steady our course, Helm.

723
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:28,053
I can't maintain targeting lock.

724
00:36:41,248 --> 00:36:42,682
Karen!

725
00:36:42,718 --> 00:36:45,018
It's all yours.
Fire when ready.

726
00:36:46,091 --> 00:36:48,357
Understood.

727
00:36:48,396 --> 00:36:49,864
Just a little closer.

728
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:55,274
We're losing our port shields.

729
00:36:55,309 --> 00:36:57,108
Steady as she goes.

730
00:37:03,526 --> 00:37:05,393
Torpedoes away.

731
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:16,643
Aft view on screen!

732
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:34,987
Did we miss the target?

733
00:37:35,991 --> 00:37:37,654
No, sir.

734
00:37:37,694 --> 00:37:39,755
It was a direct hit.

735
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,598
It just...

736
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:43,103
It didn't work.

737
00:37:46,813 --> 00:37:47,781
Orders, Captain?

738
00:37:49,551 --> 00:37:53,184
Lay in a new course.
127 mark 3...

739
00:38:18,075 --> 00:38:19,738
Hull breach on Deck Two.

740
00:38:19,778 --> 00:38:21,975
Deck Three,
Deck Four...

741
00:38:22,016 --> 00:38:23,484
Evasive maneuvers.

742
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:26,150
Bring us about
to course 127 mark 320!

743
00:38:26,191 --> 00:38:27,591
I've lost helm control!

744
00:38:27,627 --> 00:38:29,061
Main power's off-line!

745
00:38:29,097 --> 00:38:29,962
I'm rerouting the...

746
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:48,295
Auxiliary power's off-line.

747
00:38:51,308 --> 00:38:52,902
But I still have phaser control.

748
00:38:52,945 --> 00:38:54,243
Shall I return fire?

749
00:39:03,933 --> 00:39:04,923
Sir?!

750
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:08,164
No, it's over.

751
00:39:08,208 --> 00:39:09,335
The Captain wanted us...

752
00:39:09,377 --> 00:39:11,472
The Captain is dead, Chief.

753
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,676
They're all dead.

754
00:39:15,356 --> 00:39:17,019
The ship is lost.

755
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,757
There's no need
for us to die here, too.

756
00:39:20,433 --> 00:39:22,300
Abandon ship. Abandon ship.

757
00:39:22,337 --> 00:39:23,703
This is not a drill.

758
00:39:23,739 --> 00:39:26,711
All hands proceed
to emergency escape pods.

759
00:39:26,745 --> 00:39:30,412
Hey!
Somebody let me out of here!

760
00:39:30,453 --> 00:39:31,421
Help!

761
00:39:31,455 --> 00:39:32,753
Jake, Jake!

762
00:39:38,769 --> 00:39:39,737
What happened?

763
00:39:39,771 --> 00:39:41,400
We failed.

764
00:40:16,778 --> 00:40:19,750
Captain, I'm picking up
a Starfleet distress signal.

765
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:25,227
Bearing: 318 mark 005.
Range: Ten light-years.

766
00:40:25,296 --> 00:40:28,234
That location is inside
Dominion-held space.

767
00:40:28,268 --> 00:40:30,831
Can you identify the ship
sending the distress call?

768
00:40:32,143 --> 00:40:35,013
Looks like it's coming
from an escape pod.

769
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:39,478
USS... <i>Valiant.</i>

770
00:40:40,926 --> 00:40:42,828
The <i>Valiant</i>
was reported missing

771
00:40:42,864 --> 00:40:44,230
over eight months ago.

772
00:40:44,267 --> 00:40:47,262
It could be a Dominion ruse
to lure us into their territory.

773
00:40:47,373 --> 00:40:49,866
Then again, it may be genuine.

774
00:40:49,911 --> 00:40:51,038
We have to find out.

775
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:52,846
Cloak the ship
and lay in a course.

776
00:40:52,884 --> 00:40:53,977
Aye, sir.

777
00:41:06,778 --> 00:41:09,875
We scanned the area
for any other escape pods

778
00:41:09,918 --> 00:41:12,013
but it doesn't look like
anyone else made it.

779
00:41:13,258 --> 00:41:14,248
It was a long shot.

780
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,726
I just thought maybe...

781
00:41:34,133 --> 00:41:35,624
How is she, Doctor?

782
00:41:35,669 --> 00:41:37,662
I've managed to repair
her fractured skull

783
00:41:37,707 --> 00:41:39,643
and with a little rest,
she should be fine.

784
00:41:39,677 --> 00:41:40,872
And Nog?

785
00:41:40,913 --> 00:41:42,610
Oh, a few bumps and bruises

786
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:45,417
but he's going
to be fine as well.

787
00:41:45,456 --> 00:41:46,754
Can I talk to him?

788
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:48,054
I don't see why not.

789
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:02,581
Are you okay?

790
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,852
Yeah.

791
00:42:06,564 --> 00:42:08,898
You going to write a story
about all this?

792
00:42:10,773 --> 00:42:12,207
Probably.

793
00:42:14,547 --> 00:42:16,676
What are you going to say?

794
00:42:18,955 --> 00:42:20,857
What do you think I should say?

795
00:42:22,296 --> 00:42:24,664
That it was a good ship...

796
00:42:26,871 --> 00:42:29,843
with a good crew...

797
00:42:29,877 --> 00:42:32,347
that made a mistake.

798
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,444
We...

799
00:42:34,487 --> 00:42:38,154
let ourselves blindly follow
Captain Watters

800
00:42:38,195 --> 00:42:41,429
and he led us over a cliff.

801
00:42:44,407 --> 00:42:45,602
That's not true.

802
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,986
Captain Watters was a great man.

803
00:42:54,393 --> 00:42:55,861
Dorian...

804
00:42:55,896 --> 00:42:57,798
he got everyone killed.

805
00:42:59,804 --> 00:43:02,742
If he failed,
it's because we failed him.

806
00:43:05,415 --> 00:43:07,908
Put that in your story, too.

807
00:43:07,953 --> 00:43:12,657
Let people read it
and decide for themselves.

808
00:43:26,157 --> 00:43:29,527
He may have been a hero...

809
00:43:29,564 --> 00:43:33,402
he may even have been
a great man...

810
00:43:33,505 --> 00:43:36,841
but in the end,
he was a bad Captain.
