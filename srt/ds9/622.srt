1
00:00:01,794 --> 00:00:03,754
MALE:
How about it?

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:05,965
FEMALE:
Can I get some
service please?

3
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:07,132
How long's it take?

4
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:08,884
I've been
waiting forever.

5
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:11,136
This isn't what I wanted.

6
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:16,934
Having a bad day?

7
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:19,311
Like you care.

8
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:20,479
Fizz, Froth, Flip

9
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:21,814
Finial, Foam and Flare.

10
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:25,024
What's going on
at that table anyway?

11
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:28,696
I... take it there's a problem
with your drink replicator?

12
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:30,531
A problem?

13
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:33,283
No... can't be.

14
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:36,036
If there were a problem,
I would have submitted

15
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,413
an emergency maintenance request
this morning.

16
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,415
And if I
had done that

17
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:41,959
Chief O'Brien
would have assured me

18
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,712
that Rom would fix it
right away.

19
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:47,046
Then, of course,
Rom would have promised me

20
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:50,885
that Nog would fix it
before the end of the day.

21
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:53,679
And since this<i> is</i>
the end of the day

22
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,389
and there is no Nog in sight

23
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,892
we can only draw
one conclusion--

24
00:00:57,892 --> 00:01:00,227
that I don't
<i>have</i> a problem.

25
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,062
Is your drink replicator
broken?

26
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,772
You're quick today.

27
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,273
Do you want me
to fix it or not?

28
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:08,151
You?
That's right.

29
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,195
Nog had a chance to take
a trip to Ferenginar,

30
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,113
and I told him
that I would cover for him

31
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,073
while he was away.

32
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,115
Why?

33
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,868
Because he did a favor

34
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:18,245
for me last week,
so I owe him.

35
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,039
But...

36
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:25,753
that's work for a mechanic...
a repairman, a lowly engineer.

37
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:28,296
I'll tell Chief O'Brien
you said that.

38
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:32,843
Ugh...

39
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:38,640
A supernova
and a Silven surprise.

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,141
She can't do this.

41
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,309
Why not?

42
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,561
I...

43
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,396
It-it-it's not right.

44
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:47,232
She's above
that sort of thing.

45
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:50,318
Those hands weren't
meant for poking around
inside some filthy

46
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,153
drink replicator.

47
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,823
They were meant
for higher pursuits.

48
00:01:55,866 --> 00:02:00,412
You're in love.

49
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:03,248
That's the most ridiculous thing
you've said this year.

50
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,750
Really?

51
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,461
Really.

52
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,672
It must kill you
that she's married to Worf.

53
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,341
I don't know
what you're talking about.

54
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,802
Hmm.

55
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,929
And since you're not going
to order something

56
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,931
would you please
step aside

57
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,140
so that I can do
my job?

58
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,600
Of course.

59
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,602
By the way, that's not
a Silven surprise.

60
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:26,063
It's a silken sunrise.

61
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,920
Is that it?

62
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,296
That's right.

63
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,799
Hey, can I see it?

64
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:54,925
No.

65
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,594
Nog.

66
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,762
No.

67
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,388
It's an official
diplomatic message

68
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,516
from the Federation Council
to the Grand Nagus.

69
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,143
It's for his eyes only.

70
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:06,812
Yeah, but you know
what's in it.
Maybe.

71
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,023
It's a proposal for
an alliance, isn't it?

72
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,775
I mean, the Federation sends
the only Ferengi in Starfleet

73
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:15,445
to personally deliver
a diplomatic message
to the Grand Nagus?

74
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,196
Something big is up.

75
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:20,034
You told me you weren't coming
on this trip as a reporter.

76
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:21,035
I'm not.

77
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,953
I-I came to see Ferenginar.

78
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,538
I've heard a lot about it.

79
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,665
I can't wait to see the-the rain

80
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,083
and-and the muck...

81
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,835
Good.

82
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,337
Because while I'm delivering
the message to the Grand Nagus

83
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,297
you'll have plenty of time
to play tourist.

84
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,968
<i>Shenandoah,</i> 
this is Starbase 257.

85
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,137
You've been cleared
to leave our defense perimeter.

86
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:43,557
Remain at one-half impulse until
you've passed the outer marker.

87
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,892
Acknowledged.

88
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,352
I don't get to see the Nagus?

89
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,938
Now why would you want
to see the Grand Nagus?

90
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,149
My father told me to say hello.

91
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,316
A-a-and...

92
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:57,654
to... give the Nagus
his best wishes.

93
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,614
You're going to have
to do better than that.

94
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,658
And...

95
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,786
because I told the editor
of the Federation News Service

96
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,206
that I could get
an exclusive interview with Zek.

97
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:10,333
Jake! You promised me
you weren't coming along
as a reporter.

98
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,169
I didn't promise, okay?

99
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,088
I just sort of... you know?

100
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,841
Okay, I promised,

101
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,301
but this could be
a really big story, Nog.

102
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,179
The people have a right to know.

103
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:25,766
Forget it. You're not
getting anywhere near
the Grand Nagus.

104
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,768
I have no further comments.

105
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,811
(<i> beeping</i> )

106
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,771
What's that?

107
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,564
I'm not sure.

108
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:35,525
I'm having trouble
with our long-range scanners.

109
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,195
Looks like... our sensors
are being jammed.

110
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,322
(<i> alarm blares</i> )

111
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,616
Uh-oh.

112
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,957
Hang on.

113
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,756
Where'd they
come from?

114
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,049
I don't know,
but it looks

115
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,759
like they're heading
for the starbase.

116
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,177
We're not sticking
around, are we?

117
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,762
Not in a runabout,
we're not.

118
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,973
We're no match for a wing
of Jem'Hadar fighters.

119
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:13,563
See if you can open a channel
to Deep Space 9.

120
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,940
Something's wrong.

121
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,025
I think they're jamming
our com system.

122
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,568
But why would they do that?

123
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,280
Because one of them's
turned around

124
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,865
and now he's coming after us.

125
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:34,704
You do realize you're taking us

126
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,664
deeper and deeper
into Dominion-held space.

127
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,208
We don't have much choice.

128
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,460
Every time I try to change
course, they gain on us.

129
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,962
They're gaining on us anyway.

130
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,256
We might as well try
and head for the Federation.

131
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:45,673
If we keep going
in this direction,

132
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:46,883
we'll run into
Cardassia Prime

133
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:47,968
and that won't be
much fun at all.

134
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,219
COMPUTER:
Warning.

135
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,805
We are within range
of enemy weapons.

136
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,556
(<i> explosion</i> )

137
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,475
Thanks for the warning.

138
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,228
All right, when I go to impulse,
raise the forward shields

139
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,314
and transfer auxiliary power
to the phasers.

140
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:01,940
We're dropping out of warp?

141
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,234
If we have to fight,
I'd rather do it at impulse.

142
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,361
At least we'd have an edge
in maneuverability.

143
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:09,197
You're a Ferengi.
Why don't you try
making a deal or something?

144
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,325
It doesn't seem

145
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,868
they're very interested
in talking.

146
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:14,995
Stand by.

147
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,880
Here they come.

148
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,266
Shields down 30 percent.

149
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,392
I see it.

150
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,393
(<i> explosion</i> )

151
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,061
We're losing main power!

152
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,771
Keep the weapons on line.

153
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,774
Everything else is expendable,
including life support.

154
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,609
(<i> explosion</i> )

155
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:52,032
There's another ship coming in,
bearing 170 mark 215.

156
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,574
Jem'Hadar or Cardassian?

157
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,202
It's, uh...

158
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,744
it's the<i> Defiant.</i>

159
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:57,787
What?

160
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,167
That's not the<i> Defiant.</i>

161
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,793
That ship's registry number

162
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,586
is NCC-74...

163
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,255
210.

164
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,589
USS<i> Valiant.</i>

165
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,800
<i>Valiant?</i>

166
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,470
Great name! I hope they tear
that Jem'Hadar ship apart

167
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,138
piece by--

168
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,641
Jake.

169
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,101
Jake!

170
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,573
FEMALE:
Are you all
right, sir?

171
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,076
(<i> groans</i> )

172
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,618
Yeah.

173
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,662
Uh...

174
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:43,875
it's nothing serious...
Cadet, um...

175
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,252
Chief?

176
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,546
Acting Chief Petty Officer
Dorian Collins.

177
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,589
The Captain's asked me
to escort you both
to the Bridge.

178
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,757
If you'll follow me.

179
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,096
FEMALE:
Main power holding.

180
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,306
Auxiliary power
on standby.

181
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,641
Shields holding
at 84 percent.

182
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:05,021
Helm, bring us about
to course 215 mark 310.

183
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,648
215 mark 310.
Aye, sir.

184
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,944
Set quantum torpedo warheads
to maximum yield, full spread.

185
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,820
(<i> explosion</i> )

186
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,490
Maximum yield, full
spread. Aye, sir.

187
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,866
(<i> explosion</i> )

188
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,202
Helm, initiate attack
pattern sierra-four.

189
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:20,661
HELM:
Sierra-four.
Aye, sir.

190
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,497
Shields now at 78 percent.

191
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,790
Transfer auxiliary power
to shields.

192
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,791
This is Red Squad.

193
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,251
Red Squad?

194
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,462
It was a group of elite cadets
at the Academy.

195
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,004
They were...

196
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,506
the best of the best.

197
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,383
Red Squad received
special training

198
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,261
special quarters,
special everything.

199
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,513
They have their own ship?
I've heard of cadets...

200
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:41,475
getting command of
a runabout or a shuttle

201
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:42,892
but not a starship.

202
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:54,112
Fire.

203
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,323
(<i> cheering</i> )

204
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,491
As you were.

205
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:00,452
This is the Captain.

206
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,245
Stand down
from Red Alert.

207
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,664
All stations submit damage
and casualty report

208
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,124
to the First Officer.

209
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,086
Glad to see you made it
in one piece.

210
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,464
I'm Tim Watters,
Commanding Officer.

211
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:13,672
Welcome aboard.

212
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,258
Thank you... sir?

213
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,468
"Sir" is correct, Ensign.

214
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,553
I was given
a battlefield commission

215
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:21,473
and command of this vessel
by the late Captain Ramirez.

216
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,850
Using that authority, I have
commissioned and promoted

217
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,019
other members of Red Squad
as needed.

218
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,188
I see.

219
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,649
Well, I'm Ensign Nog
and this is Jake Sisko.

220
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,233
We're from Deep Space 9.

221
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,360
Sisko.

222
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,111
You're Benjamin Sisko's son.

223
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,821
That's right.

224
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,032
Ah, I've heard a lot
about your father.

225
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,576
I see you're not following
in his footsteps.

226
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,828
No. I'm a reporter.

227
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,580
You should really get
that looked at. Chief?

228
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,540
Sir?

229
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,166
Escort Mr. Sisko
to Sick Bay.

230
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,167
Aye, Captain.

231
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,502
This way, sir.

232
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:53,046
FEMALE:
Preliminary
damage report, sir.

233
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,713
Oh, thank you.

234
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:57,425
Ensign Nog, Commander Karen
Farris, our First Officer.

235
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,093
Commander.

236
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,261
Ensign.

237
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,681
Sir, the Engine Room
also reports

238
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:04,683
that we still have power spikes
cropping up all through

239
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:06,767
the deuterium injector
start-up routine.

240
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:07,977
I thought we had that

241
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:08,936
under control.

242
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,605
FARRIS:
I did, too, sir.

243
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:13,274
Have you recalibrated
the lateral impulse
control system?

244
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,775
No.

245
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,111
What does that have
to do with the injectors?

246
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,281
Well, the impulse system shares
some of the same power relays

247
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,409
used in the injector
start-up routine.

248
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,995
We'll try it.

249
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,582
Mr. Nog, why don't you wait
in my ready room.

250
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,791
Yes, sir.

251
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,794
The training cruise was
supposed to last three months.

252
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,964
We had seven regular officers
and a crew of 35 cadets.

253
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,175
The plan was for the cadets
to run the ship

254
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,510
while the officers
observed

255
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,886
and critiqued
our performance.

256
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,723
So, uh, this was
a training ship?

257
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,391
Like the other one, the, um...

258
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,351
uh... the<i> Republic.</i>

259
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,728
Not quite.

260
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,354
The<i> Republic's</i>
an old ship.

261
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,813
I don't think
she's left

262
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,649
the Terran system
in 50 years.

263
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,945
The<i> Valiant's</i> a state-
of-the-art warship.

264
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,572
Our mission was
to circumnavigate

265
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,157
the entire Federation
before returning home.

266
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,744
The entire Federation?

267
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,954
With a ship of cadets?

268
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:11,625
Not just cadets,
Mr. Sisko.

269
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,710
Red Squad cadets.

270
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,546
We were transiting the Kepla
Sector when war broke out.

271
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,632
As you probably know,
a Dominion invasion force

272
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,550
swept through that sector
on the first day.

273
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,094
So you were caught
behind enemy lines.

274
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,721
Correct.

275
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,223
We were trying to make our way
back to Federation-held space

276
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:31,227
when we encountered a Cardassian
battle cruiser near El Gatark.

277
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,480
That was our first taste
of combat.

278
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,981
In the first 15 minutes

279
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,150
four regular officers
were killed.

280
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,611
Three others were
critically wounded

281
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,362
including
Captain Ramirez.

282
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,822
Is that when
you took command?

283
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:46,534
No.
When I got to the Bridge,

284
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,536
the Captain was
in pretty bad shape,

285
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,581
but he was lucid
and he refused
to go to Sick Bay.

286
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:56,002
We had lost main power
and we were adrift

287
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,755
but the Cardassian cruiser
was no better off.

288
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,590
So it was a race
against the clock--

289
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,301
ship that got main power
back on line first

290
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:06,513
would have a decisive advantage.

291
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:12,268
The... the Captain, he...

292
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,103
he was amazing.

293
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,690
He directed the entire
damage-control effort

294
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,900
with a punctured lung
and massive internal injuries.

295
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,986
He was a great man.

296
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,114
And he won the race.

297
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,784
We got weapons
and impulse engines

298
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,994
back on line in three hours.

299
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,205
And then we destroyed
that Cardie ship.

300
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:35,124
The next day,
just before he died

301
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:39,212
the Captain ordered me
to take command of the<i> Valiant.</i>

302
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,630
(<i> laughs</i> )

303
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,716
It's unbelievable!

304
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,926
You've spent eight months
behind enemy lines.

305
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,847
I didn't do it alone.

306
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,598
The crew deserves
the real credit.

307
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,142
We have cadets here
as young as 17

308
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,895
who are doing the job
of officers twice their age.

309
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,565
But we're also seriously
undermanned.

310
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,862
I could use another officer.

311
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:06,364
I'd be happy to do
whatever I can, sir.

312
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:09,325
I see you're familiar
with the operations
of a class-7 warp drive.

313
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,744
Very familiar, sir.

314
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,912
The<i> Defiant</i> has
an identical engine.

315
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,247
Excellent.

316
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,956
As of this moment,
you are Chief Engineer.

317
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,458
Congratulations.

318
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,626
Chief Engineer?

319
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,503
With rank
of Lieutenant Commander.

320
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:21,713
Your first assignment
is to figure out

321
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:24,465
why we can't go
above warp 3.2.

322
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,592
Mr. Parton
believes that--

323
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:26,967
Excuse me, sir...

324
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,136
I-I don't think
I'm ready for this--

325
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,597
None of us were ready

326
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,558
for the responsibility
thrust upon us, Commander,

327
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:37,144
but each of us found a way
to rise to the occasion--

328
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,855
do the job that had to be done.

329
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:43,693
Ready or not...
you are Chief Engineer.

330
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,195
You can do this, Mr. Nog.

331
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,323
Just have faith in yourself,
faith in your shipmates,

332
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,158
and everything'll be fine.

333
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,502
Yes, sir.
I will, sir.

334
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,503
Good man.

335
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,130
That's what
I want to hear.

336
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,467
Now, if you can just fix
our warp drive problems,

337
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,510
we can get on with our mission.

338
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,012
Our mission?

339
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,347
I don't understand.

340
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,516
My orders are to collect
technical data

341
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,394
on a new Dominion battleship
operating in this sector.

342
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,314
We keep picking up
their com traffic

343
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,899
so we know they're in the area

344
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:26,026
but because we can't go faster
than warp 3.2

345
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,946
we're unable to get
within sensor range.

346
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:31,908
And Starfleet knows you're
in command of the<i> Valiant.</i>

347
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,743
No.

348
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,578
We've had to maintain
strict radio silence

349
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,413
ever since the war began.

350
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,040
The orders were addressed
to Captain Ramirez.

351
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,503
But since he's dead,
the mission's now mine.

352
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:48,758
Make no mistake,
I will carry out that mission.

353
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,344
Or die trying.

354
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,515
(<i> sighs</i> )

355
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,893
Dismissed.

356
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,956
Coffee?

357
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,415
Uh,<i> raktajino,</i> please.

358
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,971
Here you go.

359
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,055
Thanks.

360
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,103
So, where are you from?

361
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,271
Me?

362
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,649
Tycho City.

363
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:49,068
Oh, a Lunar Schooner.

364
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,613
I haven't heard that
in a long time.

365
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,491
Yeah. Picked it up
from my granddad.

366
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,702
Of course, he still calls
Luna "the moon"--

367
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:00,496
like it's the only one
or something.

368
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:04,000
Well, nobody who's
ever lived on the moon
calls it Luna either.

369
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,877
That's just something
they say on Earth.

370
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:07,754
So, what's it like?

371
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,547
You're from Earth,
aren't you?

372
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,508
You've never been
to the moon?

373
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,094
Just never got around to it.

374
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,512
Tell me about it.

375
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:22,727
Well... people say
it's so barren and harsh

376
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:26,689
but... it's not.

377
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,400
It's... beautiful.

378
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,235
I mean, Tycho City's
just a city,

379
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,072
but outside, where
the gravity is still low

380
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:35,531
and there's no air...

381
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:42,830
You know, the sun only comes up
once a month on the moon.

382
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,542
Every lunar morning, my father
and I would put on suits and...

383
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:50,588
hike out
across the Sea of Clouds.

384
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:53,758
We'd stop at this collection
of boulders on the western rim

385
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:58,304
and... just wait
for the sun to come up.

386
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:05,770
Dawn is so...
shocking on the moon.

387
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,480
One minute, you're

388
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,857
in the darkest night
you can imagine

389
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,318
and the next instant,
the sun lifts up

390
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:16,030
and this... glorious pure light

391
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,909
just... explodes
across the surface.

392
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:29,794
I felt like
I met God every morning.

393
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:34,298
I'm on duty.
Excuse me.

394
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,134
WATTERS:
What's your solution,
Commander?

395
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,928
I've taken the safeties
off the plasma intercooler

396
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,722
the flux moderator
and the pressure-control system.

397
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,057
That should
solve the problem.

398
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,391
You do realize
you're violating

399
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,644
about 50 safety
regulations?

400
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:47,937
Yes, sir, I do,

401
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,772
but I also know
Chief O'Brien made

402
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,190
the same changes
to the<i> Defiant.</i>

403
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,608
She never had a problem.

404
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,777
I don't know, Captain.

405
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,612
This seems
kind of risky to me.

406
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,280
Mr. Parton?

407
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,659
After spending seven months
plodding along at warp 3.2,

408
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,870
I'm willing
to try anything, sir.

409
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,707
Watters to Bridge.
Prepare for warp speed.

410
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,042
<i>Aye, sir.</i>

411
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:12,045
All right, Mr. Nog,
take us to warp 4.

412
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,199
COLLINS:
Can I help
you, sir?

413
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:42,491
No.

414
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,035
No, I've got it.

415
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,955
Any problems with Sisko's arm?

416
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,540
No, sir.

417
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,883
You got a problem, Chief?

418
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:00,134
No, sir.

419
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,765
Have you been crying?

420
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,808
(<i> sighs</i> )

421
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,936
A little.

422
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,104
About what?

423
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:15,482
I was... just...

424
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,610
thinking about home.

425
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,079
Come in.

426
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,914
Chief, I think

427
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,040
you can go now.

428
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,251
Thank you, sir.

429
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:46,055
FARRIS:
Well, Mr. Sisko

430
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,556
sounds like you
and the Chief

431
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,809
had quite a conversation
this afternoon.

432
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,228
Home and family

433
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:55,148
and the glories
of dawn on the moon.

434
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,150
Does that just
about cover it?

435
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,318
Yeah, that's, uh...
that's about it.

436
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,987
What's going on?

437
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:03,823
What's going on, Mr. Sisko,
in case you haven't noticed

438
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,033
is that we are
in the middle of a war.

439
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,619
We can't afford to have
young cadets thinking
about mommy and daddy

440
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,289
when they need to
be concentrating
on their duties.

441
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:13,791
All I did was ask
about her home.
All you did...

442
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:17,044
was plunge
a member of this crew
into emotional turmoil.

443
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,796
WATTERS:
Jake...

444
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:21,174
May I call you Jake?

445
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,052
You're a reporter.

446
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,345
Your job is to watch
the way events unfold

447
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:28,681
not participate in them.

448
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,474
Right now, you need
to stand back.

449
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,725
Take a look at
where you are--

450
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,311
what's going
on around you.

451
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:35,771
You're right in the middle
of a great story--

452
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,857
maybe one
of the greatest stories

453
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,441
in the entire Dominion war.

454
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,612
(<i> sighing</i> )

455
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,115
This ship is special, Jake.

456
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:48,534
This crew is special.

457
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,536
And whatever fates
guide this universe

458
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,873
they've chosen us to achieve
some purpose in this conflict.

459
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,082
I know that.

460
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,750
Just as surely
as I know

461
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,918
your presence
on this ship

462
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,212
is no coincidence.

463
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:00,838
You're here to write the story--

464
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:04,382
to tell people
of the<i> Valiant</i> and her crew.

465
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,927
Don't interfere
with the story, Jake.

466
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,096
Don't become a part of it.

467
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,140
Just let it unfold around you.

468
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,808
Observe, listen

469
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,061
and then
write it down.

470
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:18,772
May I have your word you'll stay
away from Chief Collins?

471
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,237
Okay.

472
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:25,738
Thank you, Jake.

473
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,865
You're dismissed.

474
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,957
I'm not sure we can trust him.

475
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,542
We'll keep an eye on him.

476
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,711
What about
Mr. Nog?

477
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:42,755
Mr. Nog wears a uniform.

478
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,215
He'll do his duty.

479
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:47,301
All right.
That'll be all, Commander.

480
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,802
I'll see you
at 1800 hours.

481
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:49,887
Yes, sir.

482
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,186
Captain

483
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,729
are you
all right?

484
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:01,107
Yes. Why?

485
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:02,358
I heard you were
on the Bridge

486
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:04,402
during midwatch
again last night.

487
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:07,154
You haven't been getting
much sleep lately, sir.

488
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,781
None of us have, Commander.

489
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,118
No, sir, I suppose not.

490
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,414
Thank you
for your concern, Karen...

491
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:20,376
but I'm... I'm fine, really.

492
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:22,669
Yes, sir.

493
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,130
I'm sorry I even brought it up.

494
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,839
That's all right.

495
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,732
(<i> sighing</i> )

496
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,168
Where've you been?

497
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,336
Engine Room.

498
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:05,129
I solved their warp problem.

499
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,880
What's that?

500
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,466
My Red Squad insignia.

501
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:10,092
Oh, and in case
you haven't noticed,

502
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:11,635
this would be my new rank--

503
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:14,096
Lieutenant Commander Nog,
Chief Engineer.

504
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,681
It has a nice ring to it...

505
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,766
don't you think?
You joined the crew?

506
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,478
Something wrong with that?
It's a little fast.

507
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:23,022
We just got here
and Watters puts you
in charge of the Engine Room?

508
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,941
<i>Captain</i> Watters is used
to making quick decisions.

509
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,902
He felt I was the right man
for the job, so he promoted me.

510
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:32,198
Red Alert. All hands
to battle stations.

511
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:34,074
I repeat, all hands
to battle stations.

512
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,205
Range: 1.32 light-years.

513
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:41,165
Speed: warp 4.7.

514
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,000
What's going on?

515
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,585
We found our
battleship.

516
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:49,048
HELMSMAN:
Their course is
170 mark 135.

517
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,966
Speed: warp 3.97.

518
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,634
FARRIS:
Bridge to phaser control.

519
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,220
You've got a spike
in the 3-L subsystem.

520
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,513
Take care of it.

521
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:57,223
Sensors show a drop

522
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:58,474
in gamma radiation...

523
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,309
...is losing power.
I'll reroute

524
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:01,477
at the auxiliary
power interface.

525
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:02,686
HELMSMAN:
They've changed course.

526
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,438
Any sign
they've detected us?

527
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:07,149
Negative. I think
we're still outside
their sensor range.

528
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,234
Maintain your
distance, Helm.

529
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:09,443
Match their course and speed.

530
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:10,568
Aye, sir.

531
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,238
Prepare a class-3 probe
for launch.

532
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:13,655
Aye, sir.

533
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,993
What happens now?

534
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,829
We're going to launch
a sensor probe to scan
the battleship.

535
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,040
That way, the<i> Valiant</i>
won't be picked up

536
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,041
on their scanners.

537
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:26,001
Won't they detect a probe?

538
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:29,213
Class-3 probes
are designed to be
virtually undetectable.

539
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:31,298
There's almost
no chance of it
being spotted.

540
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,966
JAKE:
Almost?

541
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:36,136
I don't remember anyone
inviting<i> you</i> to the Bridge.

542
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:46,522
WATTERS:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 51825.4.</i>

543
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:49,567
<i>We've been shadowing</i>
<i>the Dominion battleship</i>
<i>for three hours.</i>

544
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:51,235
<i>The data our probe</i>
<i>has gathered so far</i>

545
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:53,153
<i>has not only been interesting</i>

546
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,197
<i>but it may have given us</i>
<i>a golden opportunity</i>

547
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,408
<i>to strike a blow</i>
<i>for the Federation.</i>

548
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,201
Attention on deck!

549
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,123
Stand at ease.

550
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:08,961
It's been a long
eight months--

551
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,547
a lot of hard work,
a lot of sacrifice.

552
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,966
And now we've
accomplished
our mission.

553
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,009
We found
the battleship

554
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:19,179
and obtained a complete scan
without being detected...

555
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,764
and we're free to go home.

556
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:26,686
But that ship out there
is a direct threat

557
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:29,315
to every Federation outpost
and colony

558
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,191
within 50 light-years.

559
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:34,945
That ship must
be destroyed.

560
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:36,822
(<i> crew murmuring</i> )

561
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:42,244
It can be destroyed.

562
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,454
Commander?

563
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:46,123
We found a flaw in the design

564
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:48,708
of their antimatter
storage system.

565
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:52,712
The primary support braces
are made of viterium.

566
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,424
It's a very strong,
very resilient metal alloy

567
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,968
which just
happens to become
extremely unstable

568
00:27:57,968 --> 00:28:00,596
when exposed to
delta radiation.

569
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,848
A single torpedo, rigged
with a radiogenic warhead

570
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:06,143
could reduce those braces
to the consistency of wet pasta.

571
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,727
WATTERS:
As a result,
the entire

572
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:11,315
antimatter storage system
would tear itself apart.

573
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,026
Commander Nog.

574
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,486
You don't seem convinced.

575
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:20,698
Well, sir, in-in order
to rig a torpedo

576
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,993
to yield
a delta radiation burst,

577
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:25,538
I'll have to remove
most of the guidance systems.

578
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:27,247
We'll have
to target it manually.

579
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,500
FARRIS:
We've trained for
that possibility.

580
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,627
It shouldn't be a problem.

581
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:34,046
We'll also have to get
very close to the target.

582
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:35,548
How close?

583
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:39,218
Within 300 meters.

584
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,679
(<i> crew murmuring</i> )

585
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:45,516
It's dangerous,
there's no disputing that.

586
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:47,309
And no one would think
any less of us

587
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,019
if we just turn around
and go home.

588
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:52,898
But that means
that some other ship
with some other crew

589
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,067
would be asked
to finish the job

590
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,068
that we started.

591
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,819
I think we can do it.

592
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:02,074
I think we<i> should</i> do it.

593
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,162
Can I say something?

594
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,288
You are not a member

595
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,665
of this crew.

596
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,291
Let him speak.

597
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,961
You all probably know
who my father is.

598
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,755
Benjamin Sisko?

599
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,384
So you know I'm not exaggerating
when I say that he's considered

600
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:23,095
to be one of the best
combat officers in the fleet,

601
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,723
and I'm telling you
right now

602
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:28,934
that even with the entire crew
of the<i> Defiant</i> with him,

603
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:33,063
my father would never try
to pull off something like this.

604
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:36,900
And if he can't do it,
it can't be done.

605
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,404
We're Red Squad
and we can do<i> anything.</i>

606
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:42,155
CREW:
Yeah! Red Squad!

607
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,283
(<i> chanting</i> ):
Red Squad! Red Squad!

608
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:45,992
Red Squad!
Red Squad!

609
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,870
Red Squad! Red Squad!
Red Squad! Red Squad!

610
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,416
Red Squad! Red Squad!
Red Squad!

611
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,001
Red Squad! Red Squad!
Red Squad!

612
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,169
Red Squad!
Red Squad!

613
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,880
Red Squad! Red Squad!
Red Squad!

614
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,427
JAKE:
This is suicide.

615
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,763
No. It's not.

616
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:06,972
Nog, listen to me.

617
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,308
We're in way
over our heads here.

618
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,101
Now, someone told me
that ship out there

619
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:12,978
is twice the size
of a Galaxy-class ship...

620
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:16,398
and three times as strong.
That's accurate.

621
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:18,150
And you really think we can go
up against a ship like that?

622
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,110
I<i> think</i> that
Captain Watters knows...

623
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,321
what he's doing.
Oh, really?

624
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:25,198
Well, uh, did you know
that Watters has been taking

625
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,785
cordafin stimulants
for the past two months?

626
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:29,035
Where did you
hear that?

627
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,245
Dorian told me.

628
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,331
You were ordered
to stay away from her.

629
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:33,791
Watters to Shepard.

630
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,292
Please report
to my ready room, Lieutenant.

631
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:38,337
That's not the way we
do things in Starfleet.

632
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:41,340
I can't believe
you're buying everything
that Watters is selling.

633
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,592
He's not<i> selling</i> anything.

634
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:44,843
He's reminding

635
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,094
us of our duty.

636
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,846
I feel like
I'm having a conversation

637
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,723
with one of the bulkheads.

638
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,809
You don't understand

639
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:54,728
because you've never put on
one of these uniforms.

640
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:56,104
You don't know

641
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,649
anything about
sacrifice or honor

642
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:02,486
or duty or any other things
that make up a soldier's life.

643
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:06,114
I'm part of something
larger than myself.

644
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,701
All you care about is you.

645
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:10,076
That's right.

646
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,745
All I care about is Jake Sisko

647
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:13,079
and whether or not he's going
to be killed

648
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,414
by a bunch
of delusional fanatics

649
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,874
looking for martyrdom.

650
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:20,754
Get out.

651
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:22,589
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

652
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:27,135
I'm the Chief Engineer
of the Starship<i> Valiant.</i>

653
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,888
I'll have them put that
on your tombstone.

654
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,778
Mr. Sisko!

655
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:47,072
I'm afraid you'll have
to miss all the fun.

656
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:50,075
You're going to spend the rest
of this mission in the brig.

657
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,509
FARRIS:
All decks report
ready, sir.

658
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,762
This is the Captain.

659
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:59,311
We are about
to engage the enemy.

660
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,647
For the last eight months,

661
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:04,858
I've told you to stay
focused on one thing--

662
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:07,193
your duty.

663
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,780
But now I want you
to step back from your duty

664
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,406
and take a look around,

665
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,659
and I don't mean
look at the walls.

666
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:15,953
I want you to look
at this moment in your life.

667
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:17,454
Take it in.

668
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:19,164
Appreciate the fact
that you are on this ship

669
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:23,710
with this group of people,
at this point in history.

670
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:27,005
But understand one thing
above all else.

671
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:30,216
This moment
will never come again.

672
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,885
Hold on to it.

673
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,720
Savor it for as long as you can.

674
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,849
You're Starfleet,
you're Red Squad,

675
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:39,392
and you're the best.

676
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,771
Now...

677
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:45,899
let's get that battleship
and we can all go home.

678
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,693
Captain out.

679
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:48,735
(<i> com beep</i> )

680
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:49,987
All right then.

681
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:51,571
Good luck.

682
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,868
Take us to warp 6, Mr. Nog.

683
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:57,160
Warp six.

684
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,537
Aye.

685
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,758
They've spotted us.

686
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,134
They're dropping
out of warp.

687
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,594
Helm, go to impulse.

688
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,762
Aye, sir.

689
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,096
We are in visual range.

690
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,390
On screen.

691
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,919
Lay in a strafing course
along their superstructure

692
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:48,378
and make it close.

693
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:50,255
That way, they won't get
a weapons lock on us.

694
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,049
I want to scrape some paint
off their hull, Lieutenant.

695
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:53,508
Aye, sir.

696
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,219
Raise shields, charge phasers,
fire at any targets

697
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,262
of opportunity as we pass.

698
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,471
Aye, sir.

699
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,724
Torpedo status?
Torpedoes ready, sir.

700
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:01,892
Defense system ready.

701
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:03,894
Helm ready.

702
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:07,564
All right, Mr. Shepard,
take us in.

703
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,661
Shields holding.

704
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,872
Course stable.

705
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,582
Fire at will!

WATTERS:
Helm! Hard about!

708
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:37,010
Tactical, get a target lock
on those braces!

709
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,645

00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,605
They're trying
to jam our sensors.

711
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:50,482
WATTERS:
Mr. Nog, initiate
countermeasures.

712
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:51,524
I'm on it!

713
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,234
I've acquired the target.

714
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,571
Torpedoes locked!

715
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,782
Full power to forward shields.

716
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:01,493
Helm, plot an escape course
down the z-axis.

717
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:02,619
Ready.

718
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,245
Engage.

719
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,542
They're turning to port.

720
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,585
Match them, Helm.

721
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,795
Keep us on track.

722
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,421
Aye, sir.

723
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,214
Hull breach on Deck Two.

724
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,509
Emergency force-fields
are in place.

725
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:20,553
FARRIS:
Steady our course, Helm.

726
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,472
I can't maintain targeting lock.

727
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,029
Karen!

728
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:39,405
It's all yours.
Fire when ready.

729
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,825
Understood.

730
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,243
Just a little closer.

731
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:49,624
We're losing our port shields.

732
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,501
Steady as she goes.

733
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,634
Torpedoes away.

734
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:13,565
Aft view on screen!

735
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,650
(<i> cheering</i> )

736
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:30,248
Did we miss the target?

737
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,917
No, sir.

738
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:34,002
It was a direct hit.

739
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,795
It just...

740
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,463
It didn't work.

741
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:42,886
Orders, Captain?

742
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:48,266
Lay in a new course.
127 mark 3--

743
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,042
Hull breach on Deck Two.

744
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,377
Deck Three,
Deck Four...

745
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,046
Evasive maneuvers.

746
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,465
Bring us about to
course 127 mark 320!

747
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:21,967
I've lost helm control!

748
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,342
Main power's off-line!

749
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:24,343
I'm rerouting the...

750
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,387
(<i> yelling</i> )

751
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:45,698
Auxiliary power's off-line.

752
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,200
But I still have phaser control.

753
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,493
Shall I return fire?

754
00:38:58,295 --> 00:39:00,255
Sir?!

755
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,381
No, it's over.

756
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,883
The Captain wanted us--

757
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,761
The Captain
is dead, Chief.
They're all dead.

758
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,057
The ship is lost.

759
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,767
There's no need
for us to die here, too.

760
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,519
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

761
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,104
COMPUTER:
Abandon ship. Abandon ship.

762
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:17,605
This is not a drill.

763
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:20,859
All hands proceed
to emergency escape pods.

764
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:24,737
Hey!
Somebody let me out of here!

765
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,948
Help!
Jake, Jake!

766
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:33,997
What happened?

767
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,581
We failed.

768
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:13,828
Captain, I'm picking up
a Starfleet distress signal.

769
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:19,542
Bearing: 318 mark 005.
Range: ten light-years.

770
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,461
That location is inside
Dominion-held space.

771
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:25,006
Can you identify the ship
sending the distress call?

772
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:30,262
Looks like it's coming
from an escape pod.

773
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:35,183
USS...<i> Valiant.</i>

774
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:38,019
The<i> Valiant</i> 
was reported missing
over eight months ago.

775
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,562
It could be
a Dominion ruse

776
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,189
to lure us
into their territory.

777
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:43,649
Then again,
it may be genuine.

778
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:44,817
We have to find out.

779
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,444
Cloak the ship
and lay in a course.

780
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,654
KIRA:
Aye, sir.

781
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,628
We scanned the area
for any other escape pods,

782
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:06,047
but it doesn't look like
anyone else made it.

783
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,968
It was a long shot.
I just thought maybe...

784
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:21,313
(<i> door opens</i> )

785
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,321
How is she, Doctor?

786
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,406
I've managed to repair
her fractured skull

787
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:33,450
and with a little rest,
she should be fine.

788
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:34,451
And Nog?

789
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:36,411
Oh, a few bumps
and bruises,

790
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:39,205
but he's going
to be fine as well.

791
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,665
Can I talk to him?

792
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:42,167
I don't see why not.

793
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,681
Are you okay?

794
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,057
Yeah.

795
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:05,023
You going to write
a story about all this?

796
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,732
Probably.

797
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:11,488
What are you
going to say?

798
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:16,284
What do you think
I should say?

799
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:18,995
That it was a good ship...

800
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,958
with a good crew...

801
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,378
that made a mistake.

802
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:28,463
We...

803
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:32,758
let ourselves blindly follow
Captain Watters...

804
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:35,261
and he led us
over a cliff.

805
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:40,308
That's not true.

806
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:46,022
Captain Watters was a great man.

807
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:49,942
Dorian...

808
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,819
he got everyone killed.

809
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:56,741
If he failed,
it's because<i> we</i> failed<i> him.</i>

810
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:02,080
Put that in your story, too.

811
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:06,667
Let people read it
and decide for themselves.

812
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:22,767
He may have been a hero...

813
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:27,897
he may even have been
a great man...

814
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:30,816
but in the end,
he was a bad Captain.
