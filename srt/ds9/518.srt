1
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:07,468
I risk eight strips

2
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:11,041
with a purchase at six
and a sale of ten.

3
00:00:11,084 --> 00:00:13,055
Quark, it's your move.

4
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:15,390
Um, just a moment.

5
00:00:17,033 --> 00:00:19,665
Oh, I can't believe it.

6
00:00:19,706 --> 00:00:21,198
You beg me
to play <i>tongo</i> with you

7
00:00:21,276 --> 00:00:23,440
and then you don't
pay attention to the game.

8
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:25,075
I'll be right there.

9
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:26,849
Let me put it another way.

10
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,729
If you don't finish this hand,
I'm going to call it a night.

11
00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:32,394
Okay, okay.

12
00:00:32,436 --> 00:00:36,104
Who'd have dreamed
they'd strike feldomite

13
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:37,546
on Parsion III?

14
00:00:37,582 --> 00:00:40,019
The Sepian Commodities
Exchange is in chaos...

15
00:00:40,054 --> 00:00:41,854
everybody's selling,
prices falling.

16
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:42,860
Evade.

17
00:00:42,894 --> 00:00:45,127
Are you sure?

18
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:46,601
You heard me.
Evade!

19
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:48,629
Okay.

20
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:50,771
Confront.

21
00:00:50,813 --> 00:00:53,284
You owe me 15 strips
of latinum.

22
00:00:56,995 --> 00:00:59,057
Take it.

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,469
That's all I've got left.

24
00:01:07,788 --> 00:01:12,528
My antimonium options,
my quadrotriticale futures...

25
00:01:12,565 --> 00:01:15,629
my powdered newt supplements...

26
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:19,171
all wiped out.

27
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:23,017
That's it.
I'm finished.

28
00:01:23,057 --> 00:01:24,822
It can't be as bad as all that.

29
00:01:24,862 --> 00:01:25,830
It can and it is.

30
00:01:25,864 --> 00:01:27,390
I'm up to my lobes in debt.

31
00:01:27,434 --> 00:01:30,134
I put the bar up as collateral
to three different brokers.

32
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:32,304
The loans are due in a week.

33
00:01:32,346 --> 00:01:34,317
If I don't come up
with the latinum

34
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:35,684
there'll be nothing left of me

35
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:37,247
but a greasy spot
on the Promenade.

36
00:01:38,428 --> 00:01:39,418
Here?

37
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:42,436
Now?

38
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,038
Tell him I'm gone.

39
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,916
If that's the best lie
you can come up with

40
00:01:48,952 --> 00:01:50,855
no wonder you're broke!

41
00:01:50,891 --> 00:01:51,859
Gaila!

42
00:01:51,893 --> 00:01:54,228
What a pleasant surprise.

43
00:01:54,266 --> 00:01:55,701
I doubt it.

44
00:01:55,736 --> 00:01:58,300
A clothed female...

45
00:01:59,846 --> 00:02:01,783
how titillating.

46
00:02:03,353 --> 00:02:06,326
Isn't this the cousin
that tried to kill you?

47
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:08,764
I see you've heard of me.

48
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,297
Now, if you don't mind

49
00:02:12,342 --> 00:02:15,543
I'd like to talk
to my dear cousin...

50
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:17,110
alone.

51
00:02:21,898 --> 00:02:23,801
If you've come for your latinum

52
00:02:23,836 --> 00:02:25,932
you've come a long way
for nothing

53
00:02:25,975 --> 00:02:28,914
because that's all
I can give you... nothing.

54
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,315
Spare me the sad story.

55
00:02:30,352 --> 00:02:32,846
I'm well aware
of your financial situation

56
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:34,190
and I'm here to help.

57
00:02:34,228 --> 00:02:37,292
What are you going to do,
loan me some exploding latinum?

58
00:02:37,335 --> 00:02:39,806
I can understand
your skepticism

59
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:42,814
but I know a way
that can help the both of us.

60
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:45,082
I'm offering you a job.

61
00:02:46,524 --> 00:02:49,760
You'd defy the FCA ban
on doing business with me?

62
00:02:49,798 --> 00:02:51,598
What's family for?

63
00:02:51,636 --> 00:02:55,304
Besides, I won't tell
if you don't.

64
00:02:56,481 --> 00:02:59,045
You want me to sell weapons,
don't you?

65
00:02:59,087 --> 00:03:00,681
That's what I do.

66
00:03:00,725 --> 00:03:02,388
Now, I know
you've had reservations

67
00:03:02,462 --> 00:03:04,933
about entering
this lucrative field.

68
00:03:04,968 --> 00:03:05,936
"It's dangerous."

69
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,200
"It's too technical."

70
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,937
"It's not a people business."

71
00:03:08,977 --> 00:03:11,541
But let me tell you
something, Cousin.

72
00:03:11,584 --> 00:03:14,284
Nothing could be further
from the truth.

73
00:03:14,324 --> 00:03:15,884
I've told you before.

74
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:17,796
I can't smuggle weapons
through this station.

75
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,393
Odo would be onto me
in a second.

76
00:03:19,436 --> 00:03:22,238
Who said anything
about bringing weapons here?

77
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:23,540
Then what do you need me for?

78
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,456
I need you, Quark, to do
the things you do best...

79
00:03:28,558 --> 00:03:30,586
public relations...

80
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:33,933
showing our clients
a good time...

81
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:37,172
providing an atmosphere
conducive to closing deals.

82
00:03:37,212 --> 00:03:38,806
I can do that.

83
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:40,409
Of course you can.

84
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:43,483
And you'll earn five percent
off every sale.

85
00:03:43,528 --> 00:03:44,518
Ten.

86
00:03:48,272 --> 00:03:50,368
You'll take five.

87
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,902
I had no idea.

88
00:03:51,947 --> 00:03:54,920
Weapons is a growth industry.

89
00:03:54,954 --> 00:03:57,859
In a month,
all your debts will be paid.

90
00:03:57,895 --> 00:04:00,093
In six months,
the Ferengi Commerce Authority

91
00:04:00,134 --> 00:04:02,367
will be begging
to reinstate you.

92
00:04:02,406 --> 00:04:05,847
In a year,
you'll have your own moon.

93
00:04:05,881 --> 00:04:06,940
My own moon?

94
00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:11,392
Success... or failure?

95
00:04:11,428 --> 00:04:13,763
What's it going to be,
Cousin?

96
00:04:18,645 --> 00:04:21,048
What have I got to lose?

97
00:06:24,826 --> 00:06:25,920
Come in.

98
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:28,893
Morning, Chief.

99
00:06:28,936 --> 00:06:30,200
Shh.

100
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:32,301
Quiet.

101
00:06:32,344 --> 00:06:33,574
You'll wake him.

102
00:06:33,647 --> 00:06:35,880
He only dropped off
about an hour ago.

103
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,050
You look terrible.

104
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:40,324
I didn't get much sleep.

105
00:06:40,363 --> 00:06:43,495
He woke up every hour or two.

106
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,565
Every time I tried to put
him back in his crib

107
00:06:45,609 --> 00:06:46,703
he started crying again.

108
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:48,613
He misses his mother.

109
00:06:48,683 --> 00:06:50,950
Oh, when is Professor O'Brien
due back from Bajor?

110
00:06:50,989 --> 00:06:52,322
I don't know.

111
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:53,554
A week, maybe two...

112
00:06:53,594 --> 00:06:54,562
however long it takes

113
00:06:54,597 --> 00:06:55,964
to get that blight
under control.

114
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:57,026
That long?

115
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,300
Mm-hmm.

116
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,639
On top of that

117
00:06:59,676 --> 00:07:01,806
Annel had some kind
of family emergency

118
00:07:01,848 --> 00:07:03,819
so I'm stuck
without a baby-sitter.

119
00:07:03,853 --> 00:07:05,049
Don't worry about it, Chief.

120
00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:06,388
Everything's going to be fine.

121
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,519
I'll take care of Yoshi.

122
00:07:07,562 --> 00:07:08,552
Yeah?

123
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:09,565
Yeah, absolutely.

124
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,590
You sure you're up to it?

125
00:07:10,635 --> 00:07:11,603
Absolutely.

126
00:07:11,671 --> 00:07:13,265
I've baby-sat
Ensign Pran's hatchlings

127
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:14,437
a couple of times.

128
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:16,972
Made sure their little wings
didn't get all tangled.

129
00:07:17,986 --> 00:07:20,116
Kirayoshi doesn't
have little wings.

130
00:07:20,158 --> 00:07:22,095
Even better.

131
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,627
I think he's worn himself out.

132
00:07:25,705 --> 00:07:27,869
He should sleep now.

133
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,972
If he wakes, give him
one of his bottles.

134
00:07:30,015 --> 00:07:31,314
There's diapers
in the bag over there.

135
00:07:31,352 --> 00:07:33,152
Don't worry, Chief.
I know the drill.

136
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,161
Now, go to work.

137
00:07:35,194 --> 00:07:36,162
You need the rest.

138
00:07:36,197 --> 00:07:37,928
I'll be fine.

139
00:07:37,967 --> 00:07:39,995
I went through the same thing
with Molly.

140
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:41,599
It's just a phase.

141
00:07:41,643 --> 00:07:43,511
He'll grow out of it
sooner or later.

142
00:07:45,753 --> 00:07:47,017
Gently now.

143
00:07:50,932 --> 00:07:52,299
Yeah.

144
00:07:52,335 --> 00:07:53,804
You see?

145
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:55,172
No problem.

146
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:57,203
I'll check in with you at lunch.

147
00:07:57,247 --> 00:07:59,913
If you need me,
I'm just a com line away.

148
00:08:03,964 --> 00:08:06,562
He... he...

149
00:08:06,603 --> 00:08:08,095
Give him to me.

150
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,370
Shh.

151
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:10,503
There, there. Shh.

152
00:08:10,546 --> 00:08:12,346
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

153
00:08:12,383 --> 00:08:13,682
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

154
00:08:15,223 --> 00:08:16,988
You're good.

155
00:08:17,028 --> 00:08:19,431
He feels safe with me.

156
00:08:21,438 --> 00:08:22,702
Give me the bag.

157
00:08:22,775 --> 00:08:24,244
I'm taking him with me.

158
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,441
To work?

159
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:27,476
What choice do I have?

160
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,445
Would you stop doing that?

161
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,473
Shh. I'm just being careful.

162
00:08:40,518 --> 00:08:42,147
Odo could be anywhere...

163
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,682
or anything.

164
00:08:44,728 --> 00:08:46,631
Quark...

165
00:08:46,665 --> 00:08:50,037
we saw him walk down
the Promenade five minutes ago.

166
00:08:50,074 --> 00:08:51,543
He's very tricky.

167
00:08:54,484 --> 00:08:55,646
There he is.

168
00:08:55,687 --> 00:08:57,316
Where?

169
00:08:58,761 --> 00:09:00,823
How good to see you again.

170
00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:02,734
The pleasure's all mine.

171
00:09:02,804 --> 00:09:07,510
Quark, this is
my associate, Hagath.

172
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:08,744
Quark.

173
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:12,293
My companion, Talura.

174
00:09:12,327 --> 00:09:16,770
Your cousin speaks
very highly of you.

175
00:09:16,837 --> 00:09:20,243
I've always said my cousin is
an excellent judge of character.

176
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,773
I admire confidence in a man.

177
00:09:22,886 --> 00:09:26,156
In fact, I demand it
of my salesmen.

178
00:09:26,194 --> 00:09:27,561
But in business

179
00:09:27,597 --> 00:09:31,801
one must be careful
not to grow too confident.

180
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,904
That can be a fatal mistake.

181
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:39,414
I believe the phrase you used
to bring me here

182
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:42,922
was "an opportunity
of a lifetime."

183
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:45,336
An accurate description.

184
00:09:45,373 --> 00:09:46,672
Hmm...

185
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:48,042
show me.

186
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:01,472
Very nice.

187
00:10:06,156 --> 00:10:08,354
Mmm...

188
00:10:13,306 --> 00:10:17,840
Its weight and balance
appears just right.

189
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:21,049
Ah, we have a wide

190
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:23,859
range of targets
for you to choose from.

191
00:10:23,898 --> 00:10:26,700
Well, that won't be necessary.

192
00:10:26,738 --> 00:10:28,230
Ah!

193
00:10:28,275 --> 00:10:30,941
A perfect replica.

194
00:10:30,982 --> 00:10:33,044
It even pulls
a little to the right

195
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,556
just like the real ones.

196
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:37,393
These are the finest
holosuites in the sector.

197
00:10:37,431 --> 00:10:38,764
I believe it.

198
00:10:38,801 --> 00:10:41,102
Remember, we sold 150,000
of those to the Manchovites.

199
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:43,976
And we sold another
100,000 to the other side.

200
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,712
Now, there was
a beautiful little war.

201
00:10:46,753 --> 00:10:47,847
Too bad about the armistice.

202
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:51,194
Well, all good things
must come to an end.

203
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,224
You sell weapons
to opposing sides?

204
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:54,237
On occasion.

205
00:10:54,272 --> 00:10:56,334
It's very dangerous.

206
00:10:56,377 --> 00:10:58,814
If either side realizes
what you're doing

207
00:10:58,849 --> 00:11:01,549
it could be most unpleasant.

208
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:02,956
But as they say

209
00:11:02,992 --> 00:11:06,296
"the riskier the road,
the greater the profit."

210
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:07,928
True.

211
00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:12,745
Well, I'm glad I came.

212
00:11:12,783 --> 00:11:15,312
This solves
many of our problems.

213
00:11:15,355 --> 00:11:16,517
It certainly does.

214
00:11:16,558 --> 00:11:18,927
No actual weapons
coming in or out

215
00:11:18,964 --> 00:11:21,528
so we don't break
any local laws.

216
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,372
All shipping happens
outside Federation space

217
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,383
so Starfleet can't touch us.

218
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:30,015
And since all we're
demonstrating are holograms

219
00:11:30,124 --> 00:11:33,758
we can even show off
the specialty items.

220
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:36,032
Gaila... well done.

221
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:38,133
It was all Quark's idea.

222
00:11:39,446 --> 00:11:41,075
Quark...

223
00:11:43,957 --> 00:11:46,896
you really are quite a find.

224
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,058
I'm sure we're going

225
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,569
to accomplish
great things together.

226
00:11:49,604 --> 00:11:50,629
I can't wait.

227
00:11:50,674 --> 00:11:52,007
Uh, just one thing...

228
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:54,276
don't cross me, Quark.

229
00:11:54,315 --> 00:11:58,086
Don't ever cross me.

230
00:11:58,124 --> 00:11:59,092
Understood?

231
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:00,094
Completely.

232
00:12:00,163 --> 00:12:01,427
Right.

233
00:12:01,466 --> 00:12:02,901
Now, if it's not
too much trouble

234
00:12:02,936 --> 00:12:04,405
I'd, uh, like
to see my quarters.

235
00:12:07,413 --> 00:12:09,316
If he were a bit shorter

236
00:12:09,351 --> 00:12:12,347
and his teeth
were a little sharper

237
00:12:12,392 --> 00:12:14,761
he'd make a perfect Ferengi.

238
00:12:14,797 --> 00:12:16,357
Why'd you tell him
this was my idea?

239
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,464
I want him to like you.

240
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:29,321
The Breen CRM-114
works equally well

241
00:12:29,366 --> 00:12:33,102
against moving vessels
and surface emplacements.

242
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:36,842
It's guaranteed to cut
through reactive armor

243
00:12:36,884 --> 00:12:39,618
in the six through 15
centimeters range

244
00:12:39,657 --> 00:12:42,128
and shields to 4.6 gigajoules.

245
00:12:42,164 --> 00:12:43,861
It's light.

246
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:45,393
Here we go.

247
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:50,806
Oh. Nice.

248
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,641
The quick recharge is one
of its most popular features.

249
00:13:01,677 --> 00:13:03,773
I'll take 2,000.

250
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,119
It's a pleasure doing business

251
00:13:07,224 --> 00:13:10,356
with someone
who appreciates a fine weapon.

252
00:13:15,008 --> 00:13:16,477
How did I do?

253
00:13:16,512 --> 00:13:18,881
You're a natural salesman.

254
00:13:18,918 --> 00:13:20,353
I am, aren't I?

255
00:13:20,388 --> 00:13:22,986
It's no different
than selling sandwiches.

256
00:13:23,028 --> 00:13:24,258
What did I tell you?

257
00:13:24,297 --> 00:13:27,031
I always like to celebrate
a job well done.

258
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,505
To Quark.

259
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,374
Quark.

260
00:13:32,784 --> 00:13:35,085
I'm going to like
doing this job.

261
00:13:41,475 --> 00:13:42,671
You wanted to see me?

262
00:13:42,711 --> 00:13:44,010
Just a minute.

263
00:13:44,048 --> 00:13:48,354
Who would have thought
that so much money can be made

264
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:50,556
from Andarian glass beads?

265
00:13:52,268 --> 00:13:54,569
How did things go
with the Proxcinians?

266
00:13:54,607 --> 00:13:55,837
He purchased 7,000

267
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,246
tritanium-plated
assault skimmers.

268
00:13:58,282 --> 00:14:01,518
Good, and he'll
be back for more.

269
00:14:01,557 --> 00:14:04,121
The Proxcinian War
is just heating up.

270
00:14:04,163 --> 00:14:05,792
Lucky us.

271
00:14:07,036 --> 00:14:08,130
I suppose you're wondering

272
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:10,337
when you'll start seeing
your share of the profits.

273
00:14:10,411 --> 00:14:13,179
It had crossed my mind.

274
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:15,655
I'm afraid it won't be, uh...

275
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,658
soon.

276
00:14:16,693 --> 00:14:18,162
I don't understand.

277
00:14:18,197 --> 00:14:20,566
I took the liberty
of transferring

278
00:14:20,602 --> 00:14:23,131
your earnings directly
to your creditors.

279
00:14:23,175 --> 00:14:26,581
You'll be happy to know
they were most appreciative.

280
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:29,054
I would have paid
them their money.

281
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:32,221
I don't doubt your intentions

282
00:14:32,263 --> 00:14:35,567
but money does
strange things to people.

283
00:14:35,605 --> 00:14:38,737
I can't afford to have
one of my associates

284
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,548
distracted
with financial difficulties

285
00:14:41,586 --> 00:14:44,423
so, until your debt is paid

286
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:48,060
you won't be seeing
any profit.

287
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,612
And once
my debts are paid?

288
00:14:53,648 --> 00:14:56,746
Your earnings will be yours
to do with as you will

289
00:14:56,789 --> 00:14:59,660
as long as you remain solvent.

290
00:14:59,696 --> 00:15:01,325
Quark!

291
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,429
Do forgive me.

292
00:15:07,382 --> 00:15:11,586
You see, my associates
are like family to me

293
00:15:11,624 --> 00:15:13,595
and I feel it's my duty

294
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:16,933
to keep them from getting
into trouble...

295
00:15:16,971 --> 00:15:19,705
and to shower them
with affection.

296
00:15:21,615 --> 00:15:22,879
Go on.

297
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:24,148
Open it.

298
00:15:28,765 --> 00:15:30,462
Andarian glass beads!

299
00:15:30,503 --> 00:15:31,802
These must be worth!

300
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,813
An absolute fortune.

301
00:15:34,847 --> 00:15:38,083
A small token of my esteem.

302
00:15:38,122 --> 00:15:40,457
Look!

303
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:44,970
Go ahead.
Beat that, Chief.

304
00:15:45,004 --> 00:15:46,496
Come on, Yoshi.

305
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,035
It may not seem fair
forcing the good doctor

306
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,018
to throw from further away,
but...

307
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:53,958
he is genetically
engineered.

308
00:15:53,993 --> 00:15:57,525
Uh, Chief... don't you think
you should put the baby down?

309
00:15:57,568 --> 00:15:59,801
I haven't put Yoshi down
for a week.

310
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,369
If I can carry him at work,
I can carry him here.

311
00:16:02,412 --> 00:16:03,972
There must be some
baby-sitter on the station

312
00:16:04,017 --> 00:16:04,985
that can pacify him.

313
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:05,987
You want to bet?

314
00:16:06,022 --> 00:16:08,586
But... you can't
hold him forever.

315
00:16:08,628 --> 00:16:10,462
You've already got
one bad shoulder.

316
00:16:10,499 --> 00:16:11,900
Okay.

317
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:13,998
You want me to put
the baby down?

318
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,035
Fine.
I'll put the baby down.

319
00:16:22,495 --> 00:16:23,691
Happy?

320
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,097
That's amazing.

321
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:27,162
No, no, this is amazing.

322
00:16:31,817 --> 00:16:32,842
Yes.

323
00:16:35,426 --> 00:16:37,454
Ah. Now, if you'll excuse me

324
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,661
it's my turn to throw.

325
00:16:39,703 --> 00:16:41,002
That's right.

326
00:16:41,038 --> 00:16:42,439
Keep going.

327
00:16:42,476 --> 00:16:43,775
Uh-huh.

328
00:16:43,812 --> 00:16:45,338
Don't stop until you see smoke.

329
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:47,353
Oh...

330
00:16:47,387 --> 00:16:48,549
Come in.

331
00:16:54,772 --> 00:16:56,902
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

332
00:16:56,944 --> 00:17:00,680
I believe you know the way
to the security office.

333
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,553
None of these charges
are going to stick.

334
00:17:02,624 --> 00:17:03,854
I haven't broken any laws.

335
00:17:03,893 --> 00:17:06,228
I have a license
to run holosuites.

336
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:09,570
But you don't have a license
to sell weapons, do you?

337
00:17:09,607 --> 00:17:11,475
I defy you to prove
that I brought

338
00:17:11,512 --> 00:17:13,449
a single weapon
onto this station.

339
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:14,577
It's a mere technicality.

340
00:17:14,652 --> 00:17:15,882
We both know what you're doing.

341
00:17:15,922 --> 00:17:17,016
I promise you

342
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:18,585
you're going to face
the consequences.

343
00:17:18,696 --> 00:17:20,359
Not today he isn't.

344
00:17:21,436 --> 00:17:22,598
Let him go.

345
00:17:23,741 --> 00:17:24,869
Let him go?!

346
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,039
Major

347
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,572
tell the Constable
what you told me.

348
00:17:27,617 --> 00:17:29,781
The Bajoran government
insists that Deep Space 9

349
00:17:29,823 --> 00:17:31,794
not interfere
with the lawful transactions

350
00:17:31,827 --> 00:17:33,730
of Hagath or his associates.

351
00:17:33,765 --> 00:17:36,499
Hagath supplied arms
to the resistance.

352
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:39,272
Without him or people like him,
we'd all be dead.

353
00:17:39,312 --> 00:17:41,510
The Cardassians
would still be in power.

354
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,544
We owe him.

355
00:17:43,589 --> 00:17:44,579
Captain!

356
00:17:44,624 --> 00:17:46,993
I don't like it
any more than you do.

357
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:48,398
Better luck next time.

358
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:51,305
You better hope there
isn't a next time, Mister.

359
00:17:51,341 --> 00:17:53,106
I have cut you a lot
of slack in the past.

360
00:17:53,145 --> 00:17:54,637
I even looked away once or twice

361
00:17:54,681 --> 00:17:56,412
when I could have
come down hard on you

362
00:17:56,453 --> 00:17:57,888
but those days are over.

363
00:17:57,923 --> 00:17:59,290
Now we may not be
able to get you

364
00:17:59,326 --> 00:18:00,316
for selling weapons

365
00:18:00,362 --> 00:18:02,526
but you so much as litter
on the Promenade

366
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:04,538
and I will nail you
to the wall.

367
00:18:06,277 --> 00:18:08,271
Something to look forward to.

368
00:18:19,441 --> 00:18:21,810
I'll never forget
how many people told us

369
00:18:21,847 --> 00:18:23,407
we were making a mistake.

370
00:18:23,451 --> 00:18:26,983
Sell weapons to the Bajorans?

371
00:18:27,026 --> 00:18:29,794
"What chance do they have?

372
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:30,961
"Invest in a winner.

373
00:18:31,002 --> 00:18:32,870
Sell to the Cardassians."

374
00:18:32,907 --> 00:18:36,211
But why did you sell weapons
to the Bajorans?

375
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:38,014
They couldn't
have had any money.

376
00:18:38,052 --> 00:18:39,146
My dear Quark

377
00:18:39,189 --> 00:18:41,660
not every deal is
about making money.

378
00:18:41,694 --> 00:18:44,826
Sometimes you have to look
at the big picture

379
00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:47,842
and at times, gaining a friend

380
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,974
is more important
than making profit.

381
00:18:51,017 --> 00:18:54,287
I admit,
it's not the Ferengi way

382
00:18:54,325 --> 00:18:57,629
but it's good business,
nonetheless.

383
00:18:57,667 --> 00:19:01,005
I knew the Cardassians
would eventually lose

384
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:03,012
and you know why?

385
00:19:03,046 --> 00:19:04,983
Because they were
overly confident.

386
00:19:05,017 --> 00:19:07,181
Exactly!

387
00:19:07,223 --> 00:19:11,563
They underestimated
the Bajoran thirst for freedom.

388
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,762
I didn't.

389
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,741
You want me to handle this?

390
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,752
No.

391
00:19:19,853 --> 00:19:20,981
Come in.

392
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:26,333
Ah, Farrakk.

393
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:29,342
How nice of you to join us.

394
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,936
What was so important

395
00:19:30,979 --> 00:19:32,278
that you had to see me
in person?

396
00:19:32,316 --> 00:19:34,787
I was about to close
that deal with the Verillians.

397
00:19:34,855 --> 00:19:36,324
Oh, really?

398
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:39,731
I heard they had no longer
any need of our services.

399
00:19:39,767 --> 00:19:41,704
Since when?

400
00:19:41,738 --> 00:19:45,577
Since they signed an agreement
with Metron Consortium!

401
00:19:45,615 --> 00:19:47,779
I also heard

402
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,486
that you hadn't even
opened negotiations

403
00:19:50,526 --> 00:19:51,825
with the Verillian.

404
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:52,658
That's a lie.

405
00:19:52,698 --> 00:19:53,666
And that

406
00:19:53,701 --> 00:19:56,937
instead of doing your job...

407
00:19:56,974 --> 00:20:01,349
you were off enjoying yourself
on Risa.

408
00:20:01,386 --> 00:20:02,319
I can explain.

409
00:20:02,355 --> 00:20:05,761
I don't want any explanations!

410
00:20:05,796 --> 00:20:10,467
I put my faith in you
and you let me down.

411
00:20:10,507 --> 00:20:15,349
As from now,
our relationship is terminated.

412
00:20:15,386 --> 00:20:18,257
Hagath, can't we
just talk this over?

413
00:20:19,596 --> 00:20:20,826
I made a mistake.

414
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:23,668
An expensive mistake.

415
00:20:23,706 --> 00:20:25,141
Good-bye.

416
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,068
Are you still there?

417
00:20:40,612 --> 00:20:43,380
Now, that was a most
unpleasant experience.

418
00:20:45,124 --> 00:20:48,929
Shall we, uh, get back
to what we were talking about?

419
00:20:58,489 --> 00:21:00,220
Evening, Cousin.

420
00:21:02,732 --> 00:21:05,705
Business always this good?

421
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,374
I haven't had a single
Starfleet customer all day.

422
00:21:09,415 --> 00:21:10,782
Come to think of it

423
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:14,818
nobody from the Federation
has come through those doors.

424
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:16,490
I must be off limits.

425
00:21:16,533 --> 00:21:19,974
Quark, as long as we keep
the holosuite busy

426
00:21:20,008 --> 00:21:22,377
you've got nothing
to worry about.

427
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:23,882
Which reminds me...

428
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:27,084
we have a very special client
arriving next week...

429
00:21:27,124 --> 00:21:28,684
the Regent of Palamar.

430
00:21:28,728 --> 00:21:30,254
Never heard of him.

431
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:31,996
He's very, very wealthy.

432
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:33,629
Can't wait to meet him.

433
00:21:33,674 --> 00:21:37,673
He's also very particular
about how he's treated.

434
00:21:37,716 --> 00:21:38,498
As well he should be.

435
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:41,298
After all, he's a Regent.

436
00:21:42,341 --> 00:21:44,870
I have to say, Cousin,
you've done well.

437
00:21:44,913 --> 00:21:46,850
And it couldn't come
at a better time...

438
00:21:46,885 --> 00:21:48,184
for both of us.

439
00:21:48,221 --> 00:21:50,192
Why is that?

440
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,288
I'm thinking
about stepping back...

441
00:21:52,332 --> 00:21:54,998
taking it easy for a change.

442
00:21:55,037 --> 00:21:58,534
You could take my place...
run things with Hagath.

443
00:21:58,579 --> 00:22:01,245
You'd be earning a bigger
share of the profit.

444
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:05,193
Have you spoken to Hagath
about that?

445
00:22:05,229 --> 00:22:06,721
He likes you, Quark.

446
00:22:06,766 --> 00:22:08,634
And I like him.

447
00:22:08,671 --> 00:22:11,872
I'd also like a bigger share
of the profits.

448
00:22:11,911 --> 00:22:14,109
Then everyone's happy.

449
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,950
Except for Farrakk.

450
00:22:15,988 --> 00:22:17,480
What about Farrakk?
Didn't you hear?

451
00:22:17,525 --> 00:22:21,524
His ship blew up shortly
after he left the station.

452
00:22:21,568 --> 00:22:23,299
Warp core breach!

453
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:25,937
That Hagath... what a temper.

454
00:22:25,979 --> 00:22:28,143
What are you saying?

455
00:22:28,184 --> 00:22:30,246
Hagath killed him?

456
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:32,226
You heard what he said, Cousin.

457
00:22:32,261 --> 00:22:35,497
He doesn't like to be crossed.

458
00:22:36,604 --> 00:22:39,668
Just make sure
you don't forget that.

459
00:22:50,972 --> 00:22:54,242
Double snail juice,
extra smooth.

460
00:23:02,065 --> 00:23:04,002
Good morning, Commander.

461
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,873
Mind if I join you?

462
00:23:08,915 --> 00:23:10,578
Actually, I do.

463
00:23:10,652 --> 00:23:11,585
That's okay.

464
00:23:11,655 --> 00:23:13,489
I won't take it personally.

465
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:14,688
Quark, I'm busy.

466
00:23:14,729 --> 00:23:18,568
I have to admit, I'm
a little disappointed in you.

467
00:23:18,604 --> 00:23:20,267
I thought you of all people
would understand.

468
00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:21,505
Understand what?

469
00:23:21,545 --> 00:23:24,712
That you've finally shown
how despicable you truly are?

470
00:23:24,753 --> 00:23:26,815
That you don't care
how many people die

471
00:23:26,858 --> 00:23:28,327
as long as you make a profit?

472
00:23:28,361 --> 00:23:30,264
Who said anything
about people dying?

473
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,498
The weapons I sell
are strictly defensive.

474
00:23:32,538 --> 00:23:34,873
To be well armed
is a deterrent to war.

475
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:37,576
Don't you know anything
about the balance of power?

476
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:40,818
Quark, you don't really believe
any of that, do you?

477
00:23:40,858 --> 00:23:46,600
Jadzia... there was
nothing else I could do.

478
00:23:46,639 --> 00:23:48,576
I was drowning.

479
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,672
The waters were closing
over my head

480
00:23:50,748 --> 00:23:52,844
and just as my lungs
were about to burst

481
00:23:52,887 --> 00:23:55,154
my cousin threw me
a lifeline.

482
00:23:55,192 --> 00:23:57,790
How could I possibly refuse?

483
00:23:57,832 --> 00:24:00,566
Feeling a little guilty, Quark?

484
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,008
Guilty? Me?

485
00:24:04,447 --> 00:24:06,680
I don't have anything
to feel guilty about.

486
00:24:07,856 --> 00:24:11,319
Then why come to me
asking for forgiveness?

487
00:24:18,448 --> 00:24:19,678
I've got good news, Chief.

488
00:24:19,718 --> 00:24:21,085
Your son is fine.

489
00:24:21,121 --> 00:24:23,354
Except he cries constantly
unless I'm holding him.

490
00:24:23,393 --> 00:24:26,298
I've done every imaginable
test... eyes, ears

491
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:28,669
digestive, pulmonary
and nervous system.

492
00:24:28,706 --> 00:24:30,836
There's nothing
medically wrong with him.

493
00:24:30,877 --> 00:24:33,075
What are you telling me?
My baby's just sad?

494
00:24:33,116 --> 00:24:35,553
Perhaps he's become
prematurely aware

495
00:24:35,589 --> 00:24:38,153
of life's
existential isolation.

496
00:24:38,196 --> 00:24:39,722
You're sure it's not a rash?

497
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:41,166
Look on the bright side.

498
00:24:41,203 --> 00:24:42,934
He'll probably be
a great poet.

499
00:24:42,973 --> 00:24:44,944
There's nothing
I can do for you, Chief.

500
00:24:44,978 --> 00:24:47,040
Yes, there is.

501
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:48,073
What's wrong?

502
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,452
My neck.

503
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:50,685
Hold on.

504
00:24:50,725 --> 00:24:51,955
I'll get a neural modulator.

505
00:24:55,002 --> 00:24:57,566
Palamarian sea urchin

506
00:24:57,609 --> 00:25:01,482
lightly sautéed with garlic
and moon grass.

507
00:25:03,556 --> 00:25:07,896
Matopin rock fungi,
tossed on a bed of tartoc

508
00:25:07,933 --> 00:25:12,900
and seasoned...
with clavisoa berries.

509
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:17,479
And, for the main course...

510
00:25:17,523 --> 00:25:20,690
stuffed Wentlian congor snake.

511
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,998
All the Regent's
favorite dishes.

512
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:28,037
I obtained the recipes
through his palace chefs

513
00:25:28,081 --> 00:25:30,177
in exchange
for a small gratuity.

514
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,991
Quark, may I ask you a question?

515
00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:35,225
Go ahead.

516
00:25:35,265 --> 00:25:38,295
Are you trying
to ruin me on purpose

517
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,245
or is this sheer incompetence?

518
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,647
Ruin you?
I don't want to ruin you.

519
00:25:42,683 --> 00:25:45,212
Here we are, about
to open negotiations

520
00:25:45,256 --> 00:25:47,159
with an important new client

521
00:25:47,194 --> 00:25:50,930
and this is the welcome
you're prepared to give him?

522
00:25:50,969 --> 00:25:52,598
They told me he'd like it.

523
00:25:52,641 --> 00:25:57,277
This?
He's going to like this?!

524
00:25:57,318 --> 00:25:58,787
Yes.

525
00:26:04,235 --> 00:26:06,604
Hmm... well, he should.

526
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,804
It's delicious.

527
00:26:08,879 --> 00:26:11,146
We had you going
there, didn't we?

528
00:26:11,185 --> 00:26:12,586
Oh, you had him.

529
00:26:12,622 --> 00:26:13,921
You definitely had him.

530
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:16,829
Quark, I love you.

531
00:26:16,932 --> 00:26:20,429
It's magnificent.

532
00:26:20,474 --> 00:26:21,807
All of it.

533
00:26:21,843 --> 00:26:24,178
So glad you approve.

534
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:26,119
Well, that's enough fun
for now.

535
00:26:26,154 --> 00:26:28,057
The Regent will be here shortly

536
00:26:28,092 --> 00:26:33,059
and tonight, we are going
to make some money.

537
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:39,751
Nassuc was the finest officer
I ever had.

538
00:26:39,787 --> 00:26:42,521
I took her out of the ranks
and made her a General.

539
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:47,230
In time, she would have
inherited my entire army.

540
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,774
And how does she pay me back?

541
00:26:52,818 --> 00:26:55,518
By declaring independence
for her homeworld.

542
00:26:55,558 --> 00:27:00,366
Betrayal...
it's the one unforgivable sin

543
00:27:00,402 --> 00:27:02,600
especially when it's committed

544
00:27:02,642 --> 00:27:05,547
by someone
you trusted implicitly.

545
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,780
Most arms dealers
wouldn't understand

546
00:27:07,821 --> 00:27:09,381
such considerations.

547
00:27:09,424 --> 00:27:11,395
They have no ideals,
no passions

548
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:13,662
except for lining
their own pockets.

549
00:27:13,701 --> 00:27:16,265
I always felt
you were a man of honor.

550
00:27:17,778 --> 00:27:20,181
You're all men of honor.

551
00:27:20,217 --> 00:27:22,518
How very perceptive of you,
Regent.

552
00:27:22,555 --> 00:27:26,189
Now... how can we help you?

553
00:27:26,232 --> 00:27:29,103
I want to make an example
of Nassuc

554
00:27:29,139 --> 00:27:30,540
and her followers.

555
00:27:30,575 --> 00:27:32,773
I intend to eradicate
her entire city.

556
00:27:32,814 --> 00:27:35,183
What kind of casualties
are you looking for?

557
00:27:35,219 --> 00:27:37,190
Seven or eight million.

558
00:27:37,224 --> 00:27:39,958
We can help you there.

559
00:27:40,064 --> 00:27:41,829
But that's just the beginning.

560
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:44,169
Over the next couple of months

561
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:46,236
I would like
the death toll to rise

562
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,342
slowly but steadily.

563
00:27:48,384 --> 00:27:49,409
Can you give us a figure?

564
00:27:49,454 --> 00:27:53,396
About... 20 million.

565
00:27:56,102 --> 00:28:00,306
Now, what would be
the most effective?

566
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,111
Prions?

567
00:28:02,151 --> 00:28:05,181
Either that
or a mutagenic retrovirus.

568
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,722
What do you think, Quark?

569
00:28:07,856 --> 00:28:10,658
28 million dead?

570
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:14,767
Can't we just wound
some of them?

571
00:28:14,806 --> 00:28:16,469
I am here to buy weapons.

572
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,036
Are you here to sell them?

573
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,880
Absolutely.

574
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,949
Quark was just trying
to make a little joke

575
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:27,560
but unfortunately, Ferengi humor
doesn't translate too well.

576
00:28:27,603 --> 00:28:30,542
So let's forgo
any further attempts

577
00:28:30,577 --> 00:28:33,048
at, uh, jocularity, shall we?

578
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:35,247
And get down to the business.

579
00:28:42,807 --> 00:28:45,712
Quark...

580
00:28:45,747 --> 00:28:48,345
maybe I didn't
make myself clear.

581
00:28:48,386 --> 00:28:51,986
I've been in the weapons
business 40 years.

582
00:28:52,028 --> 00:28:53,554
I want to retire.

583
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:55,091
I don't blame you.

584
00:28:55,136 --> 00:28:57,300
But I'm not going
to be able to retire

585
00:28:57,341 --> 00:29:01,146
if my hand-picked successor
can't control his conscience.

586
00:29:01,183 --> 00:29:02,846
The Regent is insane.

587
00:29:02,888 --> 00:29:05,918
Stop being so judgmental.

588
00:29:05,962 --> 00:29:09,698
It's his bank account,
not his mental health

589
00:29:09,804 --> 00:29:11,501
you should be concerned with.

590
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:14,276
But 28 million people...
that just seems wrong.

591
00:29:14,316 --> 00:29:16,719
If Hagath heard you
talk that way

592
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:20,320
he would toss you out
the nearest airlock.

593
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:24,338
Look out there.

594
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:29,208
Millions and millions of stars.

595
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:32,223
Millions upon millions
of worlds...

596
00:29:32,258 --> 00:29:36,894
and right now, half of them
are fanatically dedicated

597
00:29:36,936 --> 00:29:39,534
to destroying the other half.

598
00:29:39,576 --> 00:29:43,210
Now, do you think

599
00:29:43,251 --> 00:29:46,714
if one of those
twinkling little lights

600
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,998
suddenly went out,
anybody would notice?

601
00:29:55,882 --> 00:29:58,912
Suppose I offered you

602
00:29:58,955 --> 00:30:04,161
ten million bars
of gold-pressed latinum

603
00:30:04,201 --> 00:30:09,077
to help turn out
one of those lights...

604
00:30:10,383 --> 00:30:13,880
would you really tell me
to keep my money?

605
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,504
Hello, Quark.

606
00:30:37,548 --> 00:30:40,680
You don't look so good.

607
00:30:40,722 --> 00:30:42,716
That's because I'm dead.

608
00:30:44,164 --> 00:30:45,964
Way to go, Quark.

609
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,043
I had my whole life ahead of me.

610
00:30:50,077 --> 00:30:51,808
I didn't do anything!

611
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:53,820
You killed us all.

612
00:30:53,854 --> 00:30:55,221
Now, hold on.

613
00:30:55,257 --> 00:30:56,726
You can't blame me.

614
00:30:56,761 --> 00:30:58,390
Deny it all you want.

615
00:30:58,431 --> 00:31:00,162
You're responsible.

616
00:31:00,203 --> 00:31:01,672
I hope it was worth it.

617
00:31:01,706 --> 00:31:03,836
How much latinum
did they pay you?

618
00:31:03,878 --> 00:31:05,746
Enough to buy a new conscience?

619
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:06,579
Why, Quark?

620
00:31:06,618 --> 00:31:08,589
Why did you kill my baby?

621
00:31:12,632 --> 00:31:14,967
This isn't my fault.

622
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:22,890
You lose.

623
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,517
No...

624
00:31:24,561 --> 00:31:26,395
no.

625
00:31:26,431 --> 00:31:30,931
No!

626
00:31:35,453 --> 00:31:37,549
What have I done?

627
00:31:42,136 --> 00:31:44,904
Chief, why is
the baby in the pit?

628
00:31:45,979 --> 00:31:47,813
It's kind of hard
to explain, sir.

629
00:31:47,849 --> 00:31:48,817
Try.

630
00:31:48,852 --> 00:31:50,014
As soon as I took him

631
00:31:50,055 --> 00:31:52,026
down there with me,
he fell asleep.

632
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,224
Could be the pattern
of the lights

633
00:31:54,265 --> 00:31:56,736
the hum
of the optronic emitters

634
00:31:56,771 --> 00:31:58,742
the vibrations
of the ODN relays...

635
00:31:58,776 --> 00:32:00,405
I'm not sure.

636
00:32:00,447 --> 00:32:03,181
But the point is,
he's not crying.

637
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,245
Yes.

638
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,918
Chief, why don't you take off

639
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,933
for a few days
until Keiko gets back?

640
00:32:08,967 --> 00:32:12,271
I think we can manage
without you for that long.

641
00:32:12,308 --> 00:32:13,607
That won't be necessary, sir.

642
00:32:13,644 --> 00:32:15,615
I have the situation
well in hand.

643
00:32:15,649 --> 00:32:19,283
What I'm trying to say is that
keeping Kirayoshi in the pit

644
00:32:19,325 --> 00:32:20,954
is not an acceptable solution.

645
00:32:20,996 --> 00:32:22,465
Find another one.

646
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,799
Yes, sir.

647
00:32:23,836 --> 00:32:25,135
Sir?

648
00:32:25,172 --> 00:32:26,641
Yes, Chief?

649
00:32:26,676 --> 00:32:30,139
Could we wait till he wakes up
before we move him?

650
00:32:30,184 --> 00:32:32,018
He only just dropped off.

651
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:36,498
Very well.

652
00:32:36,533 --> 00:32:39,335
And then I want him
out of there.

653
00:32:39,373 --> 00:32:40,706
Yes, sir.

654
00:32:42,046 --> 00:32:44,540
Don't you people
have work to do?

655
00:32:59,822 --> 00:33:02,055
What the hell
are you doing in here?

656
00:33:02,127 --> 00:33:03,357
I want you to have this.

657
00:33:03,397 --> 00:33:06,370
You broke into my quarters
to give me a <i>tongo</i> wheel?

658
00:33:06,404 --> 00:33:09,776
Get out before I call security.

659
00:33:09,813 --> 00:33:10,838
I'm going.

660
00:33:10,882 --> 00:33:12,647
And take that thing with you.

661
00:33:12,686 --> 00:33:13,985
I can't.

662
00:33:14,023 --> 00:33:15,788
It's a gift.

663
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,923
Think you can buy back
my friendship?

664
00:33:17,965 --> 00:33:19,229
It's not a bribe.

665
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:22,835
Chances are,
I won't be needing it anymore.

666
00:33:24,214 --> 00:33:25,683
Good-bye, Dax.

667
00:33:25,717 --> 00:33:28,052
Don't let the door hit you
on the way out.

668
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,492
Don't you want to know
where it is I'm going?

669
00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:33,263
Not really.

670
00:33:34,538 --> 00:33:37,375
What if I said it was dangerous?

671
00:33:37,412 --> 00:33:39,246
Figures.

672
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:41,447
Doesn't matter.

673
00:33:41,488 --> 00:33:44,552
Where I'm going,
you can't follow.

674
00:33:44,596 --> 00:33:47,900
What I have to do,
I have to do alone.

675
00:33:47,937 --> 00:33:50,170
One man who's had enough

676
00:33:50,276 --> 00:33:52,747
who's going
to stand up and say...

677
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:54,582
Good-bye, Quark.

678
00:34:12,797 --> 00:34:14,791
Nervous?

679
00:34:17,642 --> 00:34:19,943
The worst Hagath can do

680
00:34:19,981 --> 00:34:21,644
is kill you.

681
00:34:23,155 --> 00:34:24,624
What's one life

682
00:34:24,658 --> 00:34:28,497
compared to the lives
of 28 million people?

683
00:34:39,762 --> 00:34:42,394
What do you mean,
you can't get your hands

684
00:34:42,434 --> 00:34:44,199
on the mutagenic retrovirus?

685
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,871
Our supplier sold all he had
to the Minnobia

686
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,815
for their war against the Vek.

687
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,149
This isn't good.

688
00:34:50,186 --> 00:34:52,248
I've just been
telling the Regent

689
00:34:52,325 --> 00:34:56,164
that his shipment will be
delivered within a week.

690
00:34:56,201 --> 00:34:58,172
He is leaving right now.

691
00:34:58,205 --> 00:35:01,839
He is not going to be happy,
Quark!

692
00:35:01,882 --> 00:35:03,853
I know.

693
00:35:03,886 --> 00:35:06,153
He'll be stuck
with 28 million people

694
00:35:06,192 --> 00:35:07,684
and no way to kill them.

695
00:35:07,729 --> 00:35:09,700
I'm glad you're amused, Quark.

696
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:10,861
Lucky for us

697
00:35:10,903 --> 00:35:12,802
I can get hold
of some Varaxian LM-7.

698
00:35:12,802 --> 00:35:13,770
I can get hold
of some Varaxian LM-7.

699
00:35:13,804 --> 00:35:14,829
Never heard of it.

700
00:35:14,874 --> 00:35:16,343
It's a new biogenic weapon

701
00:35:16,377 --> 00:35:18,211
still in the experimental stage.

702
00:35:18,248 --> 00:35:19,478
Is it effective?

703
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:21,488
They'll be dropping like flies.

704
00:35:21,522 --> 00:35:24,222
Only trouble is...

705
00:35:24,263 --> 00:35:25,664
I don't know
how much of it I can get.

706
00:35:25,766 --> 00:35:28,534
Do you think the Regent
would be satisfied

707
00:35:28,573 --> 00:35:30,567
with only 17 million people
killed?

708
00:35:30,611 --> 00:35:35,920
Well, 17 million, um...

709
00:35:35,957 --> 00:35:37,187
it's better than nothing.

710
00:35:37,227 --> 00:35:38,628
Then what you

711
00:35:38,664 --> 00:35:42,105
have to do is tell him
there's been a change of plans.

712
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:45,203
Tell him we have something new
to show him.

713
00:35:45,246 --> 00:35:49,119
Might take a little longer
to get the results he wants

714
00:35:49,156 --> 00:35:52,619
but we'll give him
a 20 percent discount.

715
00:35:52,664 --> 00:35:54,635
In the meantime

716
00:35:54,668 --> 00:35:57,470
I'll have a sample
of Varaxian LM-7 sent here

717
00:35:57,508 --> 00:36:00,846
and we'll arrange
for a small demonstration.

718
00:36:00,883 --> 00:36:01,977
We'll find a planet

719
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,686
with some low-level life-forms
on it nobody will miss.

720
00:36:04,759 --> 00:36:09,669
I'll speak to the Regent,
try to keep him from leaving.

721
00:36:09,704 --> 00:36:12,700
You make sure
you get this sample here

722
00:36:12,779 --> 00:36:14,339
as soon as possible.

723
00:36:14,383 --> 00:36:16,981
Don't fail me, Quark.

724
00:36:17,023 --> 00:36:19,358
Believe me, I want
this deal to go through

725
00:36:19,395 --> 00:36:20,523
more than anybody.

726
00:36:20,564 --> 00:36:22,033
I'm finally out of debt.

727
00:36:22,068 --> 00:36:25,041
These are the first profits
I get to keep.

728
00:36:25,075 --> 00:36:26,567
Get going.

729
00:36:44,154 --> 00:36:45,453
Don't look so unhappy.

730
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,458
The dabo tables

731
00:36:46,493 --> 00:36:48,122
will still be there
when you get back.

732
00:36:48,163 --> 00:36:49,131
But I was winning!

733
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:50,567
What could be
more important than that?

734
00:36:50,603 --> 00:36:52,665
I told you there's somebody
I want you to meet.

735
00:36:56,417 --> 00:36:57,818
Gaila

736
00:36:57,887 --> 00:37:00,655
meet General Nassuc,
head of the Palamarian

737
00:37:00,694 --> 00:37:02,027
Freedom Brigade.

738
00:37:02,064 --> 00:37:03,556
Pleased to meet you.

739
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:05,936
We need to talk.

740
00:37:09,615 --> 00:37:11,609
Will you excuse us
for just a moment?

741
00:37:11,653 --> 00:37:14,387
What is that female
doing on the station?

742
00:37:14,426 --> 00:37:15,918
I invited her.

743
00:37:15,963 --> 00:37:16,988
Are you crazy?

744
00:37:17,032 --> 00:37:18,695
She's the Regent's mortal enemy.

745
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,104
Does he know she's here?

746
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,108
Does Hagath?

747
00:37:21,142 --> 00:37:22,132
Of course not.

748
00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:24,116
You are scaring me, Cousin.

749
00:37:24,149 --> 00:37:26,052
Relax.

750
00:37:26,087 --> 00:37:29,584
I know selling weapons
to opposing sides is dangerous

751
00:37:29,629 --> 00:37:33,035
but as you said yourself,
"The riskier the road..."

752
00:37:33,071 --> 00:37:35,042
Don't quote the Rules
of Acquisition to me!

753
00:37:35,076 --> 00:37:37,708
If Hagath finds out
we're doing this behind his back

754
00:37:37,748 --> 00:37:39,582
we'll wind up
as dead as Farrakk!

755
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:42,422
Only if we fail,
and we're not going to fail.

756
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,829
We're going to sell
Varaxian LM-7

757
00:37:44,865 --> 00:37:48,032
to both the Regent
and the General.

758
00:37:48,074 --> 00:37:49,270
Is she interested?

759
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,007
Oh, she jumped at the chance.

760
00:37:51,047 --> 00:37:52,778
She's as crazy as the Regent.

761
00:37:52,818 --> 00:37:55,757
Both sides will poison
each other

762
00:37:55,792 --> 00:37:57,455
we'll double our profits

763
00:37:57,496 --> 00:38:00,469
and Hagath...
will be very happy.

764
00:38:00,503 --> 00:38:02,474
But what if they
see one another?

765
00:38:02,508 --> 00:38:03,977
Realize what we're doing?

766
00:38:04,012 --> 00:38:05,379
It's a busy station.

767
00:38:05,415 --> 00:38:07,180
We'll keep them far apart.

768
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:10,683
Just think of all that latinum.

769
00:38:12,031 --> 00:38:15,004
What do you want me to do?

770
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:18,012
Keep the General occupied
for 20 minutes.

771
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:21,714
Then take her to Cargo Bay 5.

772
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,723
I'll meet you there.

773
00:38:28,537 --> 00:38:30,200
Open it!

774
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:31,574
You heard him.

775
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,056
That's odd.

776
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:41,568
What's wrong?

777
00:38:41,602 --> 00:38:43,937
Nothing.

778
00:38:43,974 --> 00:38:46,241
Right, Quark?

779
00:38:46,279 --> 00:38:48,182
The code sequencer
isn't working.

780
00:38:48,218 --> 00:38:50,918
Then fix it.

781
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,526
Right away.

782
00:38:55,568 --> 00:38:58,097
I just need to get
a descrambler.

783
00:38:58,142 --> 00:39:01,013
And then, while I'm at it

784
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:02,517
I'll get a bottle
of champagne...

785
00:39:02,552 --> 00:39:03,520
to celebrate.

786
00:39:03,554 --> 00:39:04,921
Forget about the champagne.

787
00:39:05,024 --> 00:39:07,052
Just get here
as quickly as possible.

788
00:39:07,096 --> 00:39:08,793
Whatever you say.

789
00:39:15,116 --> 00:39:17,587
He'll be back shortly.

790
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,929
Quark, where are you going?

791
00:39:20,963 --> 00:39:22,364
Um, I'll be right back.

792
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,462
I just have to get
a descrambler.

793
00:39:25,975 --> 00:39:27,137
After you.

794
00:39:37,536 --> 00:39:39,837
Hagath!
What's she doing here?

795
00:39:49,397 --> 00:39:51,595
Attention, all personnel.

796
00:39:51,637 --> 00:39:54,508
There are reports of phaser fire
in Cargo Bay 5!

797
00:39:54,544 --> 00:39:55,843
Seal the area!

798
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,147
You're with me!
Double-time!

799
00:40:12,753 --> 00:40:14,747
Good afternoon, Commander.

800
00:40:14,792 --> 00:40:15,988
Chief, my schedule shows

801
00:40:16,028 --> 00:40:17,896
you were supposed
to begin modifying

802
00:40:17,932 --> 00:40:20,301
the deflector array
aboard the <i>Defiant</i> today.

803
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:21,433
I'm sorry, sir.

804
00:40:21,474 --> 00:40:23,638
The Captain thought
I could use a few days' leave

805
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:25,205
so I decided
to take him up on it.

806
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,913
To care for your son.

807
00:40:28,324 --> 00:40:30,922
Looking after a baby
can be a full-time job.

808
00:40:33,403 --> 00:40:35,897
Here, do me a favor.

809
00:40:35,943 --> 00:40:37,606
Just hold him for a minute.

810
00:40:37,647 --> 00:40:40,347
I, uh, have to get his bottle.

811
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,990
Now, he-he may cry
for a bit, but it's okay.

812
00:40:44,029 --> 00:40:45,293
There's nothing wrong with him.

813
00:40:45,332 --> 00:40:46,631
But, Chief, I-I need to...

814
00:40:46,669 --> 00:40:48,263
Just be a minute.

815
00:41:09,522 --> 00:41:12,016
What is the matter?

816
00:41:12,062 --> 00:41:14,626
The baby.

817
00:41:14,669 --> 00:41:16,833
He's not crying.

818
00:41:19,848 --> 00:41:21,944
He's not crying.

819
00:41:30,373 --> 00:41:32,241
Here.

820
00:41:43,204 --> 00:41:44,935
Shh.

821
00:41:50,187 --> 00:41:54,562
I never saw my son
when he was this age.

822
00:41:54,598 --> 00:41:57,696
It is something
I will always regret.

823
00:41:59,743 --> 00:42:01,577
You are a fortunate man,
Chief.

824
00:42:03,625 --> 00:42:05,596
Chief?

825
00:42:20,131 --> 00:42:22,329
You're facing some serious
charges here, Quark...

826
00:42:22,369 --> 00:42:25,639
incitement to riot,
endangering the public safety

827
00:42:25,678 --> 00:42:26,646
disregard...

828
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,808
How was I supposed to know

829
00:42:27,916 --> 00:42:29,647
everyone was going
to start shooting?

830
00:42:29,688 --> 00:42:32,718
I just wanted them
to cross paths

831
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:35,096
so that the deal
would fall through.

832
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:36,727
It fell through, all right.

833
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:40,074
Hagath and Gaila barely managed
to get off the station alive.

834
00:42:40,112 --> 00:42:44,818
I hear General Nassuc sent a
purification squad after them.

835
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:48,195
I wouldn't count on seeing your
former business partners again.

836
00:42:48,231 --> 00:42:50,293
I can live with that.

837
00:42:50,336 --> 00:42:52,773
What about the Regent's death?

838
00:42:52,809 --> 00:42:54,301
The Regent's dead?

839
00:42:54,346 --> 00:42:57,444
A purification squad caught up
with him this morning.

840
00:42:57,487 --> 00:42:59,651
I can live with that, too.

841
00:42:59,693 --> 00:43:03,134
And I can think
of 28 million other people

842
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:05,001
who won't mind, either.

843
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:07,739
28 million and one.

844
00:43:07,779 --> 00:43:13,053
So... about those charges.

845
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:16,623
Surely we can come up
with some sort of accommodation.

846
00:43:16,666 --> 00:43:18,295
That depends.

847
00:43:18,338 --> 00:43:19,705
On what?

848
00:43:21,745 --> 00:43:23,682
This is what it's going

849
00:43:23,717 --> 00:43:25,745
to cost to repair
the cargo bay.

850
00:43:27,593 --> 00:43:28,892
That much?

851
00:43:28,929 --> 00:43:30,421
That much.

852
00:43:31,769 --> 00:43:35,175
Well... maybe we could come up

853
00:43:35,211 --> 00:43:37,079
with some sort
of installment plan?

854
00:43:39,956 --> 00:43:42,052
Works for me.

855
00:43:46,137 --> 00:43:47,868
Retreat.

856
00:43:47,908 --> 00:43:50,277
Acquire.

857
00:43:50,313 --> 00:43:52,614
Confront.

858
00:43:52,653 --> 00:43:54,418
Evade.

859
00:43:57,064 --> 00:43:58,761
The risk is at ten

860
00:43:58,801 --> 00:44:02,743
with a purchase of seven
and a sale of 14.

861
00:44:02,777 --> 00:44:05,750
Ah, nice move.

862
00:44:05,784 --> 00:44:08,723
But then you always had a knack
for getting out of tight spots.

863
00:44:08,758 --> 00:44:11,356
It's a gift.

864
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:12,731
Mm-hmm.

865
00:44:12,768 --> 00:44:16,174
Now, about my <i>tongo</i> wheel...

866
00:44:16,209 --> 00:44:18,544
It's not your <i>tongo</i> wheel.

867
00:44:18,582 --> 00:44:20,074
You gave it to me, remember?

868
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:23,092
I know that I gave it to you,
but at the time, I...

869
00:44:23,126 --> 00:44:25,154
I'm not giving it back...

870
00:44:25,197 --> 00:44:26,723
and that's final.

871
00:44:28,806 --> 00:44:30,207
Confront.

872
00:44:30,243 --> 00:44:31,302
Retreat.
