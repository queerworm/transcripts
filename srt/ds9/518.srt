1
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:07,257
I risk eight strips

2
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:10,761
with a purchase at six
and a sale of ten.

3
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,847
Quark, it's your move.

4
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:15,182
Um, just a moment.

5
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:19,478
Oh, I can't believe it.

6
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,104
You beg me
to play<i> tongo</i> with you

7
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,190
and then you don't
pay attention to the game.

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,859
I'll be right there.

9
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:26,777
Let me put it another way.

10
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:30,572
If you don't finish this hand,
I'm going to call it a night.

11
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,115
Okay, okay.

12
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:35,828
Who'd have dreamed
they'd strike feldomite

13
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:37,579
on Parsion III?

14
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,790
The Sepian Commodities
Exchange is in chaos--

15
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,709
everybody's selling,
prices falling.

16
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:42,668
Evade.

17
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,753
Are you sure?

18
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,338
You heard me.
Evade!

19
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:47,381
(<i> terminal beeping</i> )

20
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,423
Okay.

21
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,551
Confront.

22
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,052
You owe me 15 strips
of latinum.

23
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,767
Take it.

24
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:01,269
That's all I've got left.

25
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,609
(<i> sighs</i> )

26
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:12,280
My antimonium options,
my quadrotriticale futures...

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,450
my powdered newt supplements--

28
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:19,079
all wiped out.

29
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,875
That's it.
I'm finished.

30
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:24,334
It can't be as bad as all that.

31
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,627
It can and it is.

32
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,838
I'm up to my
lobes in debt.

33
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,882
I put the bar up as collateral
to three different brokers.

34
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:31,884
The loans are due in a week.

35
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:33,928
If I don't come up
with the latinum

36
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:35,512
there'll be nothing left of me

37
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,931
but a greasy spot
on the Promenade.

38
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:37,973
(<i> whispering</i> )

39
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,140
Here?

40
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,143
Now?

41
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,898
Tell him I'm gone.

42
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:48,692
MALE:
If that's the best lie
you can come up with

43
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,652
no wonder you're broke!

44
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,862
Gaila!

45
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,906
What a pleasant surprise.

46
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:55,407
I doubt it.

47
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:58,118
A clothed female...

48
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,622
how titillating.

49
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:05,960
Isn't this the cousin
that tried to kill you?

50
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,503
I see you've
heard of me.

51
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,882
Now, if you don't mind

52
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:15,260
I'd like to talk
to my dear cousin...

53
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,012
alone.

54
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,518
If you've come
for your latinum

55
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,687
you've come a long way
for nothing

56
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,398
because that's all
I can give you-- nothing.

57
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,025
Spare me the sad story.

58
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,235
I'm well aware of your
financial situation

59
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,195
and I'm here to help.

60
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,949
What are you going to do,
loan me some exploding latinum?

61
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:39,534
I can understand
your skepticism

62
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,496
but I know a way that
can help the both of us.

63
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,915
I'm offering you a job.

64
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,461
You'd defy the FCA ban
on doing business with me?

65
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,170
What's family for?

66
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:56,093
Besides, I won't tell
if you don't.

67
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,804
You want me to sell
weapons, don't you?

68
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,388
That's what I do.

69
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,099
Now, I know
you've had reservations

70
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,726
about entering
this lucrative field.

71
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,811
"It's dangerous."

72
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,062
"It's too technical."

73
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,772
"It's not a people business."

74
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:11,232
But let me tell you
something, Cousin.

75
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,944
Nothing could be further
from the truth.

76
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,696
I've told you before.

77
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,531
I can't smuggle weapons
through this station.

78
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,198
Odo would be onto me
in a second.

79
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,785
Who said anything
about bringing weapons here?

80
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,495
Then what do
you need me for?

81
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:28,207
I need you, Quark, to do
the things you do best--

82
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:30,251
public relations...

83
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,672
showing our clients
a good time...

84
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:36,967
providing an atmosphere
conducive to closing deals.

85
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,552
I can do that.

86
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,095
Of course you can.

87
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:43,057
And you'll earn five percent
off every sale.

88
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:44,224
Ten.

89
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,022
You'll take five.

90
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,606
I had no idea.

91
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,609
Weapons is
a growth industry.

92
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,529
In a month,
all your debts will be paid.

93
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:59,823
In six months,
the Ferengi Commerce Authority

94
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,076
will be begging
to reinstate you.

95
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:03,952
In a year

96
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,620
you'll have
your own moon.

97
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,747
My own moon?

98
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:11,001
Success... or failure?

99
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,503
What's it going to be,
Cousin?

100
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:20,844
What have I got to lose?

101
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,219
(<i> door chimes</i> )

102
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,385
(<i> whispers</i> ):
Come in.

103
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,264
Morning, Chief.

104
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,640
Shh.

105
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,726
Quiet.

106
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,353
You'll wake him.

107
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:36,271
He only dropped off
about an hour ago.

108
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,397
You look terrible.

109
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,775
I didn't get much sleep.

110
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,904
He woke up every
hour or two.

111
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,073
Every time I tried to put
him back in his crib

112
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,199
he started crying again.

113
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,117
He misses his mother.

114
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,245
Oh, when is Professor O'Brien
due back from Bajor?

115
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,495
I don't know.

116
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,663
A week, maybe two--

117
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,165
however long it takes

118
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,291
to get that blight
under control.

119
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,376
That long?

120
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:58,668
Mm-hmm.

121
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,337
On top of that

122
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,172
Annel had some kind
of family emergency

123
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,258
so I'm stuck
without a baby-sitter.

124
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,633
Don't worry
about it, Chief.

125
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,801
Everything's
going to be fine.

126
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:07,844
I'll take care of Yoshi.

127
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:08,845
Yeah?

128
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,138
Yeah, absolutely.

129
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,306
You sure you're
up to it?

130
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,724
Absolutely.

131
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:13,850
I've baby-sat
Ensign Pran's hatchlings

132
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,643
a couple of times.

133
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,812
Made sure their little wings
didn't get all tangled.

134
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,148
Kirayoshi doesn't
have little wings.

135
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,318
Even better.

136
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,820
I think he's
worn himself out.

137
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,864
He should sleep now.

138
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,824
If he wakes, give him
one of his bottles.

139
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,410
There's diapers in
the bag over there.

140
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,161
Don't worry, Chief.
I know the drill.

141
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,163
Now, go to work.

142
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,081
You need the rest.

143
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,874
I'll be fine.

144
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,834
I went through the
same thing with Molly.

145
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,586
It's just a phase.

146
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,546
He'll grow out of it
sooner or later.

147
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,092
Gently now.

148
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,264
Yeah.

149
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,890
You see?

150
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,267
No problem.

151
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,060
I'll check in
with you at lunch.

152
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,896
If you need me,
I'm just a com line away.

153
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,107
(<i> Yoshi cries</i> )

154
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,235
He...

155
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,653
he...

156
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,071
Give him to me.

157
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,406
Shh.

158
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:10,657
There, there. Shh.

159
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,367
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

160
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,785
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

161
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,120
(<i> crying stops</i> )

162
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,955
You're good.

163
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,458
He feels safe with me.

164
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:22,794
Give me the bag.

165
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,212
I'm taking him with me.

166
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,464
To work?

167
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,507
What choice do I have?

168
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,352
Would you stop
doing that?

169
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,479
Shh. I'm just being careful.

170
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,022
Odo could be anywhere...

171
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,732
or anything.

172
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,567
Quark...

173
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,904
we saw him walk down
the Promenade five minutes ago.

174
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,531
He's very tricky.

175
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:55,618
There he is.

176
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,245
Where?

177
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,790
How good
to see you again.

178
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,750
The pleasure's
all mine.

179
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,506
Quark, this is
my associate, Hagath.

180
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:08,923
Quark.

181
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,758
My companion

182
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,302
Talura.

183
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:16,806
Your cousin speaks
very highly of you.

184
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:20,060
I've always said my cousin is
an excellent judge of character.

185
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,854
I admire confidence
in a man.

186
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:26,066
In fact, I demand it
of my salesmen.

187
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,775
But in business

188
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:31,863
one must be careful
not to grow too confident.

189
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,866
That<i> can</i> be a fatal mistake.

190
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,827
I believe
the phrase you used

191
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,287
to bring me here

192
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,957
was "an opportunity
of a lifetime."

193
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,252
An accurate
description.

194
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,669
Hmm...

195
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,129
show me.

196
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,393
Very nice.

197
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,233
Mmm...

198
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:17,825
Its weight and balance
appears just right.

199
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,037
Ah, we have a wide

200
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,748
range of targets for
you to choose from.

201
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,585
Well, that won't be necessary.

202
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:28,044
Ah!

203
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,797
A perfect replica.

204
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,799
It even pulls
a little to the right

205
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,509
just like the real ones.

206
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:37,220
These are the finest
holosuites in the sector.

207
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,013
I believe it.

208
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,974
Remember, we sold 150,000
of those to the Manchovites.

209
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,893
And we sold another
100,000 to the other side.

210
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,146
Now, there was a
beautiful little war.

211
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,814
Too bad about the armistice.

212
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:51,025
Well, all good things
must come to an end.

213
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,111
You sell weapons
to opposing sides?

214
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,154
On occasion.

215
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,030
It's very dangerous.

216
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,699
If either side realizes
what you're doing

217
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,411
it could be most unpleasant.

218
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,079
But as they say

219
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,124
"the riskier the road,
the greater the profit."

220
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,750
True.

221
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:12,547
Well, I'm glad
I came.

222
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,091
This solves
many of our problems.

223
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,343
It certainly does.

224
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,511
No actual weapons

225
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:18,886
coming in or out

226
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,306
so we don't break
any local laws.

227
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,017
All shipping happens
outside Federation space

228
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,020
so Starfleet
can't touch us.

229
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,981
And since all we're
demonstrating are holograms

230
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:33,318
we can even show off
the specialty items.

231
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,945
Gaila... well done.

232
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,114
It was all Quark's idea.

233
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,034
Quark...

234
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:46,705
you really are
quite a find.

235
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,291
I'm sure we're going

236
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,376
to accomplish
great things together.

237
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,460
I can't wait.

238
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,836
Uh, just one thing--

239
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,130
don't cross me, Quark.

240
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,509
Don't<i> ever</i> cross me.

241
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:58,552
Understood?

242
00:11:58,552 --> 00:11:59,553
Completely.

243
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:00,887
Right.

244
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,305
Now, if it's not
too much trouble

245
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,890
I'd, uh, like
to see my quarters.

246
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,687
If he were a bit shorter

247
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:11,690
and his teeth
were a little sharper

248
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,025
he'd make a perfect Ferengi.

249
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,734
Why'd you tell him
this was my idea?

250
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,904
I want him to like you.

251
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,623
The Breen CRM-114
works equally well

252
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:32,502
against moving vessels
and surface emplacements.

253
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:36,130
It's guaranteed to cut
through reactive armor

254
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,841
in the six through 15
centimeters range

255
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,553
and shields to
4.6 gigajoules.

256
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,221
It's light.

257
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:44,931
Here we go.

258
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,186
Oh. Nice.

259
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,988
The quick recharge is one
of its most popular features.

260
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,199
I'll take 2,000.

261
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,827
It's a pleasure
doing business

262
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,914
with someone
who appreciates a fine weapon.

263
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,754
How did I do?

264
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:18,256
You're a natural salesman.

265
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,840
I am, aren't I?

266
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,427
It's no different
than selling sandwiches.

267
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,970
What did I tell you?

268
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,473
I always like to celebrate
a job well done.

269
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:27,766
To Quark.

270
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:29,892
Quark.

271
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,522
I'm going to like
doing this job.

272
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,489
You wanted
to see me?

273
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,324
Just a minute.

274
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:48,369
Who would have thought
that so much money can be made

275
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,664
from Andarian glass beads?

276
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:54,626
How did things go
with the Proxcinians?

277
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,127
He purchased 7,000

278
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,171
tritanium-plated
assault skimmers.

279
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,633
Good, and he'll
be back for more.

280
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:04,010
The Proxcinian War
is just heating up.

281
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,844
Lucky us.

282
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,515
I suppose you're wondering

283
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,350
when you'll start seeing
your share of the profits.

284
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,102
It had crossed
my mind.

285
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,814
I'm afraid
it won't be, uh...

286
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:16,897
soon.

287
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,316
I don't understand.

288
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,652
I took the liberty
of transferring

289
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:23,070
your earnings directly
to your creditors.

290
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,574
You'll be happy to know
they were most appreciative.

291
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,951
I would have paid
them their money.

292
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,205
I don't doubt
your intentions

293
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:35,583
but money does
strange things to people.

294
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,837
I can't afford to have
one of my associates

295
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:41,631
distracted
with financial difficulties

296
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,384
so, until your debt is paid

297
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:48,054
you won't be seeing
any profit.

298
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,808
And once

299
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,643
my debts are paid...?

300
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:56,813
Your earnings will be yours
to do with as you will

301
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,691
as long as you remain solvent.

302
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,359
Quark!

303
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,528
Do forgive me.

304
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:11,619
You see, my associates
are like family to me

305
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,580
and I feel it's my duty

306
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,791
to keep them from getting
into trouble...

307
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,836
and to shower them
with affection.

308
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,922
Go on.

309
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,131
Open it.

310
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,513
Andarian glass beads!

311
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:31,931
These must be worth...!

312
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,809
An absolute fortune.

313
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:38,020
A small token
of my esteem.

314
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,274
Look!

315
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,692
(<i> dartboard beeps</i> )

316
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,944
Go ahead.
Beat that, Chief.

317
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,613
Come on, Yoshi.

318
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,907
It may not seem fair
forcing the good doctor

319
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,825
to throw from
further away,<i> but...</i>

320
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,787
he is genetically
engineered.

321
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,622
Uh, Chief...
don't you think

322
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,457
you should put
the baby down?

323
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,834
I haven't put Yoshi down
for a week.

324
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,295
If I can carry him at work,
I can carry him here.

325
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,630
There must be some
baby-sitter on the station

326
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,631
that can pacify him.

327
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,048
You want to bet?

328
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,509
But... you can't
hold him forever.

329
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,511
You've already got
one bad shoulder.

330
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,930
Okay.

331
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,890
You want me to put
the baby down?

332
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,142
Fine. I'll put
the baby down.

333
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:22,482
(<i> Yoshi crying</i> )

334
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,691
Happy?

335
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,067
That's amazing.

336
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,153
No, no,<i> this</i> is amazing.

337
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,783
(<i> cooing softly</i> )

338
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:32,951
Yes.

339
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,413
Ah. Now,
if you'll excuse me

340
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,624
it's my turn to throw.

341
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,000
QUARK:
That's right.

342
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,418
Keep going.

343
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,795
Uh-huh.

344
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:45,296
Don't stop until you see smoke.

345
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,255
(<i> door chimes</i> )

346
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,298
Oh...

347
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,549
Come in.

348
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,891
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

349
00:16:56,891 --> 00:17:00,645
I believe you know the way
to the security office.

350
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,563
None of these charges
are going to stick.

351
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,731
I haven't broken any laws.

352
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,732
I have a license

353
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,484
to run holosuites.

354
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:09,487
But you don't have a license
to sell weapons, do you?

355
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,405
I defy you to prove
that I brought

356
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,366
a single weapon
onto this station.

357
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,701
It's a mere technicality.

358
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:15,952
We both know what you're doing.

359
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,411
I promise you

360
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,621
you're going to face
the consequences.

361
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,331
Not today he isn't.

362
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:22,625
Let him go.

363
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,627
Let him go?!

364
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,128
Major

365
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,380
tell the Constable
what you told me.

366
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,631
The Bajoran
government

367
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,299
insists that Deep Space 9

368
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,801
not interfere
with the lawful transactions

369
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,636
of Hagath
or his associates.

370
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,347
Hagath supplied arms
to the resistance.

371
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:39,141
Without him or people like him,
we'd all be dead.

372
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,477
The Cardassians
would still be in power.

373
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,521
We owe him.

374
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:44,522
Captain!

375
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:45,773
I don't like it

376
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,025
any more
than you do.

377
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,776
Better luck next time.

378
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,070
You better hope there
isn't a next time, Mister.

379
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,947
I have cut you a lot
of slack in the past.

380
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,657
I even looked away
once or twice

381
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,116
when I could have
come down hard on you

382
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,577
but those days are over.

383
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:58,828
Now we may not be
able to get you

384
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,496
for selling weapons

385
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,415
but you so much as<i> litter</i>
<i>on the Promenade</i>

386
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,542
and I will nail you
to the wall.

387
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,254
Something
to look forward to.

388
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,809
I'll never forget
how many people told us

389
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,310
we were making a mistake.

390
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:27,023
Sell weapons
to the Bajorans?

391
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,817
"What chance
do they have?

392
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,069
"Invest in a winner.

393
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,862
Sell to the Cardassians."

394
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:36,032
But why<i> did</i> you sell weapons
to the Bajorans?

395
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,034
They couldn't
have had any money.

396
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,619
My dear Quark

397
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,495
not every deal is
about making money.

398
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,791
Sometimes you have to look
at the big picture

399
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,794
and at times,
gaining a friend

400
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,922
is more important
than making profit.

401
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:54,008
I admit,
it's not the Ferengi way

402
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:57,428
but it's good business,
nonetheless.

403
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:01,057
I knew the Cardassians
would eventually lose

404
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,059
and you know why?

405
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,061
Because they were
overly confident.

406
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,063
Exactly!

407
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:11,484
They underestimated
the Bajoran thirst for freedom.

408
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,777
I didn't.

409
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,029
(<i> door chimes</i> )

410
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,739
You want me to handle this?

411
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,742
No.

412
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,035
Come in.

413
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:25,456
Ah, Farrakk.

414
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:28,626
How nice of you to join us.

415
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,086
What was so important

416
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,295
that you had to see me
in person?

417
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,713
I was about to close

418
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,840
that deal with
the Verillians.

419
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,675
Oh, really?

420
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:39,053
I heard they had no longer
any need of our services.

421
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,055
(<i> laughing</i> ):
Since when?

422
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:44,976
Since they signed an agreement
with Metron Consortium!

423
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:47,061
I also heard

424
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,814
that you hadn't even
opened negotiations

425
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:50,982
with the Verillian.

426
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:52,066
That's a lie.

427
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,317
And that

428
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,320
instead of doing your job...

429
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,658
you were off enjoying yourself
on Risa.

430
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:01,951
I can explain.

431
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:05,038
I don't want any explanations!

432
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,709
I put my faith in you
and you let me down.

433
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:14,588
As from now,
our relationship is terminated.

434
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,675
Hagath, can't we
just talk this over?

435
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:18,843
(<i> chuckles</i> )

436
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,178
I made a mistake.

437
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:22,972
An expensive mistake.

438
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,598
Good-bye.

439
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,485
Are you still there?

440
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,700
Now, that was a most
unpleasant experience.

441
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,451
(<i> laughs</i> )

442
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,328
Shall we, uh, get back

443
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,288
to what we were
talking about?

444
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,633
GAILA:
Evening, Cousin.

445
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,972
Business always
this good?

446
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:08,768
I haven't had a single
Starfleet customer all day.

447
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,603
Come to think of it

448
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:14,190
nobody from the Federation
has come through those doors.

449
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,775
I must be off limits.

450
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,317
Quark

451
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,278
as long as we keep
the holosuite busy

452
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,571
you've got nothing

453
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:21,739
to worry about.

454
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,574
Which reminds me--

455
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:26,452
we have a very special client
arriving next week--

456
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:27,954
the Regent of Palamar.

457
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,538
Never heard of him.

458
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,373
He's very,
very wealthy.

459
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,833
Can't wait to meet him.

460
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,376
He's also

461
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,963
very particular
about how he's treated.

462
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,297
As well he should be.

463
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,968
After all, he's a Regent.

464
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,720
I have to say, Cousin,
you've done well.

465
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,764
And it couldn't come
at a better time...

466
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:47,932
for both of us.

467
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,809
Why is that?

468
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,061
I'm thinking about
stepping back--

469
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,353
taking it easy

470
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,148
for a change.

471
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:58,109
You could take my place--
run things with Hagath.

472
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:00,987
You'd be earning a bigger
share of the profit.

473
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:05,032
Have you spoken to Hagath
about that?

474
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,700
He likes you, Quark.

475
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,452
And I like him.

476
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,747
I'd also like a bigger share
of the profits.

477
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,874
Then everyone's happy.

478
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,751
Except for Farrakk.

479
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,628
What about Farrakk?
Didn't you hear?

480
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:21,381
His ship blew up shortly
after he left the station.

481
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,092
Warp core breach!

482
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,803
That Hagath--
what a temper.

483
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,888
What are you saying?

484
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,849
Hagath killed him?

485
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,934
You heard what he said, Cousin.

486
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:35,353
He doesn't like to be crossed.

487
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:39,566
Just make sure
you don't forget that.

488
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:53,706
Double snail juice,
extra smooth.

489
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,465
Good morning, Commander.

490
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:08,262
Mind if I join you?

491
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:09,930
Actually, I do.

492
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,140
That's okay.

493
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,850
I won't take it personally.

494
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,392
Quark, I'm busy.

495
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,562
I have to admit,
I'm a little disappointed

496
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,189
in you.

497
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:19,232
I thought you of all people
would understand.

498
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:21,192
Understand what?

499
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:23,903
That you've finally shown
how despicable you truly are?

500
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,072
That you don't care
how many people die

501
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,781
as long as you
make a profit?

502
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,700
Who said anything
about people dying?

503
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,869
The weapons I sell
are strictly defensive.

504
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:34,163
To be well armed
is a deterrent to war.

505
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,832
Don't you know anything
about the balance of power?

506
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,918
Quark, you don't
really believe

507
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,502
any of that, do you?

508
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:45,925
Jadzia... there was
nothing else I could do.

509
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,885
I was drowning.

510
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,970
The waters were closing
over my head

511
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,139
and just as my lungs
were about to burst

512
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,516
my cousin threw me
a lifeline.

513
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,061
How could I
possibly refuse?

514
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:59,939
Feeling a little
guilty, Quark?

515
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,440
Guilty? Me?

516
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,778
I don't have anything
to feel guilty about.

517
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,824
Then why come to me
asking for forgiveness?

518
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:18,999
BASHIR:
I've got good news, Chief.

519
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,376
Your son is fine.

520
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,627
Except he cries
constantly

521
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,296
unless I'm
holding him.

522
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,631
I've done every imaginable
test-- eyes, ears

523
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,841
digestive, pulmonary
and nervous system.

524
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,052
There's nothing
medically wrong with him.

525
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:32,388
What are you telling me?
My baby's just sad?

526
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:34,890
Perhaps he's become
prematurely aware

527
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,435
of life's
existential isolation.

528
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:39,061
You're sure
it's not a rash?

529
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:40,478
Look on the bright side.

530
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:42,189
He'll probably be
a great poet.

531
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,233
There's nothing
I can do for you, Chief.

532
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:46,360
Yes, there is.

533
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,445
What's wrong?

534
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:48,904
My neck.

535
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,114
Hold on.

536
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:51,407
I'll get
a neural modulator.

537
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,912
Palamarian sea urchin

538
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:01,000
lightly sautéed with garlic
and moon grass.

539
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:07,173
Matopin rock fungi,
tossed on a bed of tartoc

540
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:12,219
and seasoned...
with clavisoa berries.

541
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:16,932
And, for the main course...

542
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:20,186
stuffed Wentlian congor snake.

543
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:24,273
All the Regent's
favorite dishes.

544
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:27,318
I obtained the recipes
through his palace chefs

545
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:29,527
in exchange for
a small gratuity.

546
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:33,324
Quark, may I ask
you a question?

547
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:34,741
Go ahead.

548
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:37,661
Are you trying
to ruin me on purpose

549
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,456
or is this
sheer incompetence?

550
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,124
Ruin you? I don't
want to ruin you.

551
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,584
Here we are, about
to open negotiations

552
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:46,504
with an important new client

553
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:50,049
and this is the<i> welcome</i>
<i>you're prepared to give him?</i>

554
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,967
They told me
he'd like it.

555
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:56,638
<i>This?</i> He's going
to like<i> this?!</i>

556
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,224
Yes.

557
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,981
Hmm... well,
he should.

558
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,983
It's delicious.

559
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,528
We had you going
there, didn't we?

560
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:12,071
Oh, you had him.

561
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,197
You definitely had him.

562
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:16,116
Quark, I love you.

563
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:19,828
It's magnificent.

564
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,080
All of it.

565
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,457
So glad you approve.

566
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,334
Well, that's enough fun
for now.

567
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,253
The Regent will
be here shortly

568
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:32,383
and tonight, we are going
to make some money.

569
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:39,056
Nassuc was the finest officer
I ever had.

570
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:41,850
I took her out of the ranks
and made her a General.

571
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:46,564
In time, she would have
inherited my entire army.

572
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,069
And how does she pay me back?

573
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:54,738
By declaring independence
for her homeworld.

574
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:59,617
Betrayal--
it's the one unforgivable sin

575
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,995
especially when it's committed

576
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,831
by someone
you trusted implicitly.

577
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,126
Most arms dealers
wouldn't understand

578
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,752
such considerations.

579
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,754
They have no ideals,
no passions

580
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,048
except for lining
their own pockets.

581
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,633
I always felt
you were a man of honor.

582
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,430
You're all men of honor.

583
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,890
How very perceptive of you,
Regent.

584
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,394
Now... how can we help you?

585
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:28,355
I want to make an example
of Nassuc

586
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,023
and her followers.

587
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,109
I intend to eradicate
her entire city.

588
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:34,487
What kind of casualties
are you looking for?

589
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:36,447
Seven or eight million.

590
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:39,199
We can help you there.

591
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,118
But that's just the beginning.

592
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:43,329
Over the next couple of months

593
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,414
I would like
the death toll to rise

594
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:47,625
slowly
but steadily.

595
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:48,792
Can you give us a figure?

596
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:52,712
About... 20 million.

597
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:59,595
Now, what would be
the most effective?

598
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,305
Prions?

599
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:04,475
Either that
or a mutagenic retrovirus.

600
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:07,311
What do you think, Quark?

601
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:11,231
28 million dead?

602
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,900
Can't we just wound
some of them?

603
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,693
I am here to buy weapons.

604
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,237
Are you here to sell them?

605
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,947
Absolutely.

606
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:22,034
Quark was just trying
to make a little joke

607
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,453
but unfortunately,
Ferengi humor

608
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,580
doesn't translate
too well.

609
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,707
So let's forgo
any further attempts

610
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:32,211
at, uh, jocularity, shall we?

611
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,505
And get down to the business.

612
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,640
Quark...

613
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,518
maybe I didn't
make myself clear.

614
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:51,104
I've been in the weapons
business 40 years.

615
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,772
I want to retire.

616
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,191
I don't blame you.

617
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:56,402
But I'm not going
to be able to retire

618
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:58,111
if my hand-picked
successor

619
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,406
can't control
his conscience.

620
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:01,907
The Regent is insane.

621
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,951
Stop being
so judgmental.

622
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:08,788
It's his bank account,
not his mental health

623
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,749
you should be
concerned with.

624
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,419
But 28 million people--
that just seems wrong.

625
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,754
If Hagath heard you
talk that way

626
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,592
he would toss you out
the nearest airlock.

627
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,596
Look out there.

628
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,392
Millions and
millions of stars.

629
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:31,395
Millions upon millions
of worlds...

630
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:35,982
and right now, half of them
are fanatically dedicated

631
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,818
to destroying
the other half.

632
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:42,364
Now, do you think

633
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:45,784
if<i> one</i> of those
twinkling little lights

634
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:50,122
suddenly went out,
anybody would notice?

635
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,963
Suppose I offered you

636
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:03,260
ten million bars
of gold-pressed latinum

637
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:08,181
to help turn out
one of those lights...

638
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:13,019
would you really tell me
to keep my money?

639
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,543
Hello, Quark.

640
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:39,713
You don't look so good.

641
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:41,840
That's because I'm dead.

642
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,135
JAKE:
Way to go, Quark.

643
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,014
I had my whole life ahead of me.

644
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,890
I didn't do anything!

645
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,892
<i>You</i> killed us all.

646
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,102
Now, hold on.

647
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,813
You can't blame me.

648
00:30:55,813 --> 00:30:57,356
Deny it all you want.

649
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,149
You're responsible.

650
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,776
I hope it was worth it.

651
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:02,902
How much latinum
did they pay you?

652
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,530
Enough to buy
a new conscience?

653
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,823
O'BRIEN:
Why, Quark?

654
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:07,700
Why did you kill my baby?

655
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:11,537
(<i> wheel clicking</i> )

656
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:14,122
This isn't
my fault.

657
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,375
(<i> wheel stops</i> )

658
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,005
You lose.

659
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,549
No...

660
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,300
no.

661
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:30,096
(<i> screaming</i> ):
No!

662
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,603
What have I done?

663
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:44,027
(<i> whispering</i> ):
Chief, why is
the baby in the pit?

664
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:46,905
It's kind of hard
to explain, sir.

665
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:47,989
Try.

666
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,408
As soon as I took him

667
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,034
down there with me,
he fell asleep.

668
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,119
Could be the pattern
of the lights

669
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,664
the hum
of the optronic emitters

670
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:57,708
the vibrations
of the ODN relays...

671
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:59,251
I'm not sure.

672
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:02,170
But the point is,
he's not crying.

673
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,380
Yes.

674
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,048
Chief, why don't
you take off

675
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,967
for a few days until
Keiko gets back?

676
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,845
I think we can
manage without you

677
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,179
for that long.

678
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,806
That won't
be necessary, sir.

679
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,516
I have the situation
well in hand.

680
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,560
What I'm trying
to say is that

681
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,228
keeping Kirayoshi
in the pit

682
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:20,063
is not an
acceptable solution.

683
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,440
Find another one.

684
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,858
Yes, sir.

685
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,150
Sir?

686
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,611
Yes, Chief?

687
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,654
Could we wait
till he wakes up

688
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,155
before we move him?

689
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,157
He only just dropped off.

690
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,579
Very well.

691
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:38,248
And then I want him
out of there.

692
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:39,750
Yes, sir.

693
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,545
Don't you people
have work to do?

694
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:01,104
What the hell
are you doing in here?

695
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,439
I want you
to have this.

696
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,941
You broke
into my quarters

697
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:05,317
to give me
a<i> tongo</i> wheel?

698
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:08,528
Get out before
I call security.

699
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,071
I'm going.

700
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,657
And take that<i> thing</i> with you.

701
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,032
I can't.

702
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,743
It's a gift.

703
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,620
Think you can buy back
my friendship?

704
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,246
It's not a bribe.

705
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,917
Chances are,
I won't be needing it anymore.

706
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,795
Good-bye, Dax.

707
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:27,046
Don't let the door hit you
on the way out.

708
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,466
Don't you want to know
where it is I'm going?

709
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:32,427
Not really.

710
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:36,306
What if I said
it was dangerous?

711
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:38,224
Figures.

712
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,226
Doesn't matter.

713
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:43,480
Where I'm going,
you can't follow.

714
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,064
What I have to do

715
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,900
I have to do alone.

716
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,194
One man who's had enough

717
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,738
who's going
to stand up and say...

718
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,532
Good-bye, Quark.

719
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,844
Nervous?

720
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,974
The worst Hagath can do

721
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:20,642
is kill you.

722
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:23,645
What's one life

723
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:27,482
compared to the lives
of 28 million people?

724
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,871
What do you mean, you
can't get your hands

725
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:42,622
on the mutagenic
retrovirus?

726
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:45,291
Our supplier sold all he had
to the Minnobia

727
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,293
for their war
against the Vek.

728
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,712
This isn't good.

729
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,630
I've just been
telling the Regent

730
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,174
that his shipment
will be delivered

731
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,467
within a week.

732
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,469
He is leaving
right now.

733
00:34:56,469 --> 00:35:00,348
He is not going
to be happy,<i> Quark!</i>

734
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,267
I know.

735
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,644
He'll be stuck
with 28 million people

736
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,104
and no way to kill them.

737
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,106
I'm glad you're
amused, Quark.

738
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,566
Lucky for us

739
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:12,861
I can get hold
of some Varaxian LM-7.

740
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,071
Never heard of it.

741
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:15,447
It's a new
biogenic weapon

742
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,365
still in the experimental stage.

743
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,617
Is it effective?

744
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,493
They'll be dropping like flies.

745
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:23,204
Only trouble is...

746
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,915
I don't know
how much of it I can get.

747
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:27,500
Do you think the Regent
would be satisfied

748
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,628
with only 17 million people
killed?

749
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:34,716
Well, 17 million, um...

750
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:35,968
it's better
than nothing.

751
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:37,803
QUARK:
Then what you

752
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:41,139
have to do is tell him
there's been a change of plans.

753
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,267
Tell him we have something new
to show him.

754
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:48,105
Might take a little longer
to get the results he wants

755
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:51,650
but we'll give him
a 20 percent discount.

756
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,485
In the meantime

757
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:56,279
I'll have a sample
of Varaxian LM-7 sent here

758
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,491
and we'll arrange
for a small demonstration.

759
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,409
We'll find a planet

760
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,662
with some low-level life-forms
on it nobody will miss.

761
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:08,667
I'll speak to the Regent,
try to keep him from leaving.

762
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,837
You make sure
you get this sample here

763
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:13,379
as soon as possible.

764
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:16,008
Don't fail me, Quark.

765
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:18,384
Believe me, I want
this deal to go through

766
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:19,552
more than anybody.

767
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,262
I'm finally
out of debt.

768
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:24,182
These are the first
profits I get to keep.

769
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,600
Get going.

770
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,862
(<i> sighs</i> )

771
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,036
Don't look so unhappy.

772
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:45,578
The dabo tables

773
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:46,955
will still be there
when you get back.

774
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:48,456
But I was winning!

775
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,208
What could be
more important than that?

776
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,668
I told you there's somebody
I want you to meet.

777
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,090
Gaila

778
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,634
meet General Nassuc,
head of the Palamarian

779
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,178
Freedom Brigade.

780
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:02,637
Pleased to meet you.

781
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,057
(<i> whispering</i> ):
We need to talk.

782
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,520
Will you excuse us
for just a moment?

783
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,481
What is that female
doing on the station?

784
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,733
I invited her.

785
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,068
Are you crazy?

786
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:17,652
She's the Regent's
mortal enemy.

787
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,237
Does he know
she's here?

788
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,197
Does Hagath?

789
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:21,489
Of course not.

790
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,241
You are scaring me, Cousin.

791
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,118
Relax.

792
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:28,538
I know selling weapons
to opposing sides is dangerous

793
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:31,958
but as you said yourself,
"The riskier the road..."

794
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,086
Don't quote the Rules
of Acquisition to me!

795
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:35,420
If Hagath finds out

796
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,796
we're doing this
behind his back

797
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,464
we'll wind up as
dead as Farrakk!

798
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:41,426
Only if we fail,
and we're not going to fail.

799
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,803
We're going to sell
Varaxian LM-7

800
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:47,057
to both the Regent
<i>and</i> the General.

801
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,349
Is she interested?

802
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,976
Oh, she jumped
at the chance.

803
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,770
She's as crazy
as the Regent.

804
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,688
Both sides will poison

805
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,814
each other

806
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,524
we'll double our profits

807
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:59,485
and Hagath...
will be very happy.

808
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,446
But what if they
see one another?

809
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,031
Realize what we're doing?

810
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,449
It's a busy station.

811
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,284
We'll keep them
far apart.

812
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,704
Just think of all
that latinum.

813
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:14,042
What do you
want me to do?

814
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:17,045
Keep the General occupied
for 20 minutes.

815
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:20,715
Then take her
to Cargo Bay 5.

816
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:24,719
I'll meet you there.

817
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,307
Open it!

818
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,725
You heard him.

819
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,942
That's odd.

820
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:40,568
REGENT:
What's wrong?

821
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,904
Nothing.

822
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:45,157
Right, Quark?

823
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:47,242
The code sequencer
isn't working.

824
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:49,911
Then<i> fix</i> it.

825
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,540
Right away.

826
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,043
I just need to get
a descrambler.

827
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,921
And then,
while I'm at it

828
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:01,256
I'll get a bottle
of champagne--

829
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:02,548
to celebrate.

830
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,217
Forget about
the champagne.

831
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:06,136
Just get<i> here</i> as
quickly as possible.

832
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:07,804
Whatever you say.

833
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,563
He'll be back shortly.

834
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,941
Quark, where are
you going?

835
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,359
Um, I'll be right back.

836
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,611
I just have to get
a descrambler.

837
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,198
After you.

838
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,751
REGENT:
Hagath!
What's she doing here?

839
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:42,047
(<i> yelling and weapons fire</i> )

840
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,596
ODO:
Attention, all personnel.

841
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:53,599
There are reports of phaser fire
in Cargo Bay 5!

842
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,060
Seal the area!

843
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,145
MAN:
You're with me!
Double-time!

844
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:04,819
(<i> sighs</i> )

845
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,370
Good afternoon,
Commander.

846
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,871
Chief,<i> my</i> schedule shows

847
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,831
you were supposed
to begin modifying

848
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,042
the deflector array
aboard the<i> Defiant</i> today.

849
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,210
I'm sorry, sir.

850
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,586
The Captain thought

851
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,213
I could use
a few days' leave

852
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:24,463
so I decided
to take him up on it.

853
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:26,591
To care for your son.

854
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:29,844
Looking after a baby
can be a full-time job.

855
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:34,640
Here, do me a favor.

856
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,517
Just hold him
for a minute.

857
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:39,312
I, uh, have to
get his bottle.

858
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:42,732
Now, he-he may cry for
a bit, but it's okay.

859
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,192
There's nothing
wrong with him.

860
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,610
But, Chief, I-I need to...

861
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,195
Just be a minute.

862
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,452
(<i> Yoshi gurgling</i> )

863
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,546
(<i> gurgling</i> )

864
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:10,509
What is the matter?

865
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:13,221
The baby.

866
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:15,473
He's not crying.

867
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:20,478
He's not crying.

868
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,738
Here.

869
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,501
Shh.

870
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:48,923
(<i> sighs</i> )

871
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:53,011
I never saw my son
when he was this age.

872
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:56,264
It is something
I will always regret.

873
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,101
You are a fortunate man,
Chief.

874
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:02,479
(<i> snoring softly</i> )

875
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:04,522
Chief?

876
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,331
You're facing some serious
charges here, Quark--

877
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:22,748
incitement to riot

878
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,292
endangering the
public safety

879
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,502
disregard...

880
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:27,045
How was I supposed to know

881
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,587
everyone was going
to start shooting?

882
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:31,549
I just wanted them
to cross paths

883
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,759
so that the deal
would fall through.

884
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,803
It fell through, all right.

885
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,931
Hagath and Gaila barely managed
to get off the station alive.

886
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:43,644
I hear General Nassuc sent a
purification squad after them.

887
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:47,148
I wouldn't count on seeing your
former business partners again.

888
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:49,275
I can live with that.

889
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,569
What about the Regent's death?

890
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,488
The Regent's dead?

891
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:56,366
A purification squad caught up
with him this morning.

892
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:59,077
I can live with that, too.

893
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:02,121
And I can think
of 28 million other people

894
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,956
who won't mind, either.

895
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:06,625
28 million and one.

896
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:11,964
So... about those charges.

897
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:15,468
Surely we can come up
with some sort of accommodation.

898
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:17,345
That depends.

899
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:18,596
On what?

900
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:22,434
This is what it's going

901
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:24,643
to cost to repair
the cargo bay.

902
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:27,772
That much?

903
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,482
That much.

904
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:34,028
Well... maybe we could come up

905
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,030
with some sort
of installment plan?

906
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,993
Works for me.

907
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,749
Retreat.

908
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:49,210
Acquire.

909
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,421
Confront.

910
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:53,381
Evade.

911
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:55,883
(<i> laughing</i> )

912
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,510
The risk is at ten

913
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:01,598
with a purchase of seven
and a sale of 14.

914
00:44:01,598 --> 00:44:04,517
Ah, nice move.

915
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:06,102
But then you
always had a knack

916
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:07,562
for getting out
of tight spots.

917
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:10,398
It's a gift.

918
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:11,774
Mm-hmm.

919
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:14,986
Now, about<i> my tongo</i> wheel...

920
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:17,363
It's not your
<i>tongo</i> wheel.

921
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,365
You gave it to me,
remember?

922
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,867
I know that I<i> gave</i> it to you,
but at the time, I...

923
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:24,036
I'm not giving
it back...

924
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,663
and that's final.

925
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:29,041
Confront.

926
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,002
Retreat.
