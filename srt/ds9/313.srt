1
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:13,931
Jake!

2
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:15,724
Hi!

3
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:18,101
Leanne, I thought
you were on Bajor.

4
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,562
I came back early.

5
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:24,065
You know, I was just
thinking about you.

6
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,275
Really?

7
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:27,402
Yeah, I passed the
Klingon restaurant

8
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,404
where you and I and Orak
were eating dinner...

9
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:30,698
And you ordered
the<i> gagh.</i>

10
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,073
Yeah. How is Orak?

11
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,909
I haven't talked
to him in a while.

12
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:37,078
We, uh, stopped seeing
each other a few weeks ago.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,080
Oh.
Yeah.

14
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:46,296
So, are... you doing
anything tomorrow night?

15
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:49,216
Well, I'm supposed
to play dom-jot with Nog.

16
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,634
Oh.

17
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,469
But they're not
really firm plans.

18
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,555
In fact, I was thinking
of canceling them.

19
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,556
Really?

20
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,932
If you do cancel

21
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,893
would you be interested
in dinner?

22
00:00:58,934 --> 00:00:59,977
Sure.

23
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:01,353
Great.

24
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,271
How about 1800 at the
Klingon restaurant?

25
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,356
I'll be there.

26
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:07,026
But this time,
we'll skip the<i> gagh.</i>

27
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,277
Definitely.

28
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,030
I'll see you then.

29
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,531
Okay.

30
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,494
O'BRIEN:
Move aside!

31
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:18,746
ODO:
Look out!

32
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,957
Move! Move!

33
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,169
(alarm blaring)

34
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,839
What have we got?

35
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:30,382
Bajoran transport
coming in.

36
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,884
They had some kind
of accident on board.

37
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:32,843
They got casualties.

38
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:33,969
They're docking.

39
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,012
We should have
beamed the wounded

40
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:36,055
directly to the infirmary.

41
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,264
They have
a loose plasma coil.

42
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,139
We couldn't beam
through the radiation.

43
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,349
Docking clamps secure.

44
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,976
I'm opening the airlock.
Stand back.

45
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:50,611
Come on.

46
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,653
This way.

47
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:52,780
This way.

48
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:53,948
(coughing)

49
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:54,782
It's all right.

50
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:55,950
Here, I've
got you.

51
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:56,992
ODO:
It's all right.

52
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,827
Come along now.
Come on.

53
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,996
This way, Eminence.

54
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,915
Kai Winn.

55
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:06,043
The Vedek-- take care
of the Vedek.

56
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,968
Odo to Kira.

57
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,803
<i>Kira here.</i>

58
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,679
I think you should meet us
in the Infirmary, Major.

59
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,848
<i>Vedek Bareil</i>
<i>was on the transport.</i>

60
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,725
<i>He's been injured.</i>

61
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,606
The report
from the transport, sir.

62
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,024
Give me the
short version.

63
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,442
There was
a molecular fracture

64
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,985
in one of the
plasma conduits.

65
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,820
It was only a matter of time
before it gave way.

66
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,114
Once it collapsed

67
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,740
the entire relay
system exploded.

68
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,408
Was it sabotage?

69
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,826
I don't think so.

70
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,079
Why would you
suspect sabotage?

71
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:51,750
I would prefer to discuss that
with the Emissary in private.

72
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,390
Put a pressor field
on that artery.

73
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,601
The arterial disruption
is too severe.

74
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,937
The pressor can't stop
the hemorrhaging.

75
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,688
All right, clamp
off the artery

76
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,732
and then increase the
plasma level to maximum.

77
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:16,942
(steady tone sounding)

78
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,401
Cardiac arrest.

79
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,780
Clear.

80
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,240
Clear.

81
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,242
He can't take
much more of that.

82
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:27,119
The arterial pressure
is falling.

83
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,495
I see it.

84
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,789
The neurotransmitter levels
are falling, too.

85
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,207
Two cc's cordrazine.

86
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,583
Doctor?

87
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,376
Do it.

88
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:39,798
(alarm beeping)

89
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,300
Synaptic failure.

90
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,468
Apply direct neurostimulation
to the brain stem.

91
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,810
Thank you.

92
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,981
Vedek Bareil
and I were on our way

93
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,774
to a secret meeting
with a member

94
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:00,401
of the Cardassian
Central Command.

95
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,445
It was my intention
to open talks

96
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:06,033
between Bajor and Cardassia
that would lead to a treaty

97
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,036
and a final
peace settlement.

98
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:12,289
<i>You</i> have been negotiating
peace with Cardassia?

99
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:13,707
The Prophets teach us

100
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:17,460
that while violence
may keep an enemy at bay

101
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,505
only peace can
make him a friend.

102
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,965
How long has this
been going on?

103
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,092
Vedek Bareil has
been working to set up

104
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,802
this meeting
with Legate Turrel

105
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,804
for the past
five months.

106
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,056
They've discussed issues

107
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,766
ranging from
war reparations

108
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,144
to the exchange of Ambassadors.

109
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,771
There's even
the possibility

110
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,190
that the Cardassians

111
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:41,276
will issue
a formal apology

112
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:44,821
for the pain and suffering
inflicted on the Bajoran people

113
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,740
during the occupation.

114
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,991
I was on my way

115
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,285
to our first
face-to-face meeting

116
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:53,080
when we had
the accident.

117
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,414
Please, don't take this
the wrong way

118
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:58,710
but I never would have guessed
that<i> you</i> would be the one

119
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:02,505
to bring such a bold vision
of peace to Bajor.

120
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:06,218
A large share of the credit
goes to Vedek Bareil.

121
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,763
Without him, the talks could
have never come this far.

122
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,723
It sounds like you've developed

123
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,642
a deeper appreciation
for Vedek Bareil.

124
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:19,647
I must admit, he has been
a loyal and trustworthy aide

125
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,067
since the election.

126
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:25,528
I'm not sure I could have been
as... forgiving

127
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,697
had I been
in his place.

128
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:28,865
These talks

129
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,367
were Bareil's idea.

130
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,493
He's guided me through them

131
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,496
and without him,
in the future,

132
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,333
these talks may never resume.

133
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,846
I'm sorry.

134
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,390
The radiation
severely damaged

135
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:55,267
his neural pathways.

136
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:58,519
I did everything I could.

137
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,730
I know you did.

138
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,899
Did he ever regain
consciousness?

139
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:06,236
No, I don't think he suffered.

140
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:07,737
Thank you, Doctor.

141
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,364
I'm... on duty in Ops.

142
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,532
Excuse me.
Kira...

143
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,954
I think they can get along
without you in Ops today.

144
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,706
Maybe, but I need to be there.

145
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,001
I appreciate your concern

146
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:24,545
but I'll grieve in my own way,
in my own time.

147
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,684
We're ready to begin
the autopsy, Doctor.

148
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,857
Release
the stasis field.

149
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,039
Let's begin
with a neural scan.

150
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,458
I want to map his
central axonal pathways.

151
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,835
Find out where
the breakdown began.

152
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,718
Shall I begin taking
neural tissue samples?

153
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,517
Looks like the damage began
in the parietal lobe.

154
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,228
Spread through the rest of the
brain in a retrograde manner.

155
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,024
Wait a minute.

156
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,109
A neuron
just fired

157
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,652
in his cerebral cortex.

158
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,409
There it is again.

159
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,411
His nerves, his nerves
are still transmitting

160
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,329
electrical impulses
to his brain.

161
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,580
How can that be?

162
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,541
His brain activity is zero.

163
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,583
His nervous system

164
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,959
should be
completely inactive.

165
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,753
I don't know,
but it means his body's

166
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,505
still capable of sending
messages to the brain

167
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:51,632
even though the brain
can't process them.

168
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,468
The radiation he was exposed to

169
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,970
might have fortified
his peripheral cell membranes.

170
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:01,059
If we can regenerate
his pathways

171
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,520
with his own
neuron cells

172
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,355
we might be able
to revive him.

173
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,023
What about brain damage?

174
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,901
There's been no oxygen to his
brain for almost 40 minutes.

175
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,778
But he's been in stasis
for most of that time.

176
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,447
That, combined
with the strengthening

177
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:16,074
of his cell membranes might
buy us the time we need.

178
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,078
We'll have to direct a
burst of electrical energy

179
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,955
into his cerebral cortex.

180
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:28,669
If the burst is
the proper intensity

181
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,756
it should create a cascade
effect within the brain

182
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,301
and the neurons might resume

183
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,471
their normal
firing pattern.

184
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,680
Okay.

185
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,016
Let's close up
the cranial cavity.

186
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,248
The neurogenic stimulator
is in place.

187
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,916
Let's try a 50-millivolt burst.

188
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,376
(buzzing)

189
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,339
Increase it to 60.

190
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,591
(buzzing)

191
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,429
Seventy.

192
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:20,555
That's five millivolts

193
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,182
above what normal
tissue can stand.

194
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,766
It'll burn out
his cerebral cortex.

195
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,102
If I'm right, the
inaprovaline drug

196
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,271
that I gave him should
provide additional resistance

197
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,814
against the excess
electrostimulation.

198
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:30,731
Seventy!

199
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,150
(buzzing)

200
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,193
(inhales)

201
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,444
Doctor!

202
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,580
Well, it's
a little early to tell

203
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,707
but I'm hoping
he'll make a full recovery.

204
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,709
He should be back on his feet
again in a few weeks.

205
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,711
You say that
so calmly.

206
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:53,963
But it's not every doctor

207
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,465
that can lose a patient,
and then have him

208
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,175
back on his feet
in a few weeks.

209
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,844
WINN:
Indeed, you are too modest.

210
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:03,306
You've performed nothing
less than a miracle here.

211
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,892
The Prophets must walk
with you, Doctor.

212
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,186
Well, I and the Prophets
were lucky

213
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,690
that the ionizing radiation
left a residual signature

214
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,316
on Bareil's axonal pathways.

215
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,193
That's what really
made this possible.

216
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:20,907
Whoever deserves the credit,
Doctor, I am grateful.

217
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,492
WINN:
And I am grateful

218
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:25,286
you were not taken
from us, Vedek Bareil.

219
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,746
My work here
is not yet finished.

220
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:28,707
No...

221
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,500
it is not.

222
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:34,295
We must resume
the negotiations immediately.

223
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:37,756
We can't risk losing
the momentum we've established.

224
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,758
I would like to send
a coded message

225
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,555
to Legate Turrel,
and invite him to come to DS9

226
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,056
to continue
the talks.

227
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,765
Wait a minute.

228
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,519
Bareil's in no condition
to conduct negotiations.

229
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:52,272
Bareil will simply
be advising me.

230
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,275
<i>I</i> will conduct
the actual talks.

231
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,987
Then I'll allow it as long
as your visits don't tire him.

232
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,449
Agreed.

233
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,619
Vedek, we will
talk again soon.

234
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,911
Eminence.

235
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,294
So...

236
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:19,924
are we going to be playing
springball next month?

237
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:26,222
You bet, although I'm afraid I
might have an unfair advantage.

238
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:29,309
You mean, playing
against a dead man?

239
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,311
No.

240
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,438
I've been practicing.

241
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,948
My dad said that you
were looking for me.

242
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,409
Yeah, um, it's about
tomorrow night.

243
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,619
Don't worry.

244
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,078
I've all ready
taken care of that.

245
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,080
I met these three Terrellians

246
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:54,292
who were bragging about
how great they are at dom-jot.

247
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,211
So I arranged a game--
us against them.

248
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,421
(laughs)

249
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,922
Look, Nog, we have
a-a little problem.

250
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:00,965
No, we don't.

251
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,592
I guarantee we'll beat them.

252
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,469
It's not that.

253
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,304
I just can't make it
tomorrow night.

254
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,681
But it has to be

255
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,516
tomorrow night--
they're leaving the next day.

256
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,018
I-I made other plans.

257
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:15,188
What could be more
important than dom-jot?

258
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,565
I have a date.

259
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:21,611
Oh, well, (laughs)
that's different.

260
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:22,696
It is?

261
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:25,323
Yeah. Money is money

262
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:29,118
but women are better.

263
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,870
Is that a Rule of Acquisition?

264
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,246
It's a personal rule.

265
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,791
So, who is she?

266
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:35,709
Leanne.

267
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,126
Ah, Leanne!

268
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,462
Ah!
Way to go, Jake!

269
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,339
So, what is the name of my
date?

270
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,257
I hope she's
as cute as Leanne.

271
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,300
<i>Your</i> date?

272
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,219
She has a friend, right?

273
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,804
I'm sure
she does.

274
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:50,014
Then tell her
to bring her along.

275
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,016
Nog, that's not
what I had in mind.

276
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,935
That's because
you were confused.

277
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,188
Would you rather
the three of us go out?

278
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,524
When you put it
that way...

279
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:00,817
Exactly.

280
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,820
Just one
thing, Jake.

281
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:07,407
You're still pretty new
at this dating business.

282
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:11,369
Just promise me you won't
do anything to embarrass me.

283
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:13,913
I'll do my best.

284
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,833
Ah, this'll be great.

285
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,627
Maybe I'll even wash my lobes.

286
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:20,961
(chuckles)

287
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,048
I suggest we put off discussion

288
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,133
of the Cardassians
returning the Orbs

289
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:30,096
until diplomatic relations
have been established.

290
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:33,391
That would only delay
an inevitable argument.

291
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,518
But it will give
the peace process

292
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,270
a chance to grow.

293
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,231
Once the Cardassians
are invested in the process

294
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,401
it, it may be easier
to discuss these matters.

295
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:49,365
Very well.

296
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,659
A wise decision,
Eminence.

297
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,829
I hope so,
Vedek Bareil.

298
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,873
The first meeting
with Turrel

299
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:59,876
is scheduled
for tomorrow afternoon.

300
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,878
I will see you
before then.

301
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,883
(chuckles)

302
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:08,092
I take it
you're not here

303
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,887
to deliver a good
report, Doctor.

304
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,891
In order to revive you...

305
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,017
I had to flood
your nervous system

306
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,895
with neurogenic radiation.

307
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,939
Unfortunately,
this has caused

308
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,482
some kind of selective

309
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,901
vasoconstriction
of your arteries.

310
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:27,570
The result is
an inadequate blood flow

311
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,071
to your internal organs.

312
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,198
So what do we do?

313
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,993
We'd like to place you back
into stasis...

314
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,496
do some research
on your condition.

315
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,290
For how long?

316
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,959
I don't know yet.

317
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,335
Days, weeks...

318
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,003
even months.

319
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,296
Maybe even years?

320
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,589
Maybe.

321
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,716
I'm sorry, Doctor,
that's not acceptable.

322
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,092
I can't
allow myself

323
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,219
to be put
in storage

324
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,638
when my people need me.

325
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,183
I don't want to wake
to a Bajor still haunted

326
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,602
by the memory of the
occupation.

327
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:03,481
I realize how important
these talks are to Bajor

328
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:07,986
but, as your physician,
my duty is to you first.

329
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,571
And I have a duty to Bajor.

330
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:15,702
Please, help me heal my people.

331
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,287
It's the only thing
that matters to me.

332
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,543
There is...

333
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:30,049
an experimental drug...

334
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,926
called vasokin

335
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,053
which would increase
the blood flow to your organs

336
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,347
and<i> might...</i> enable you

337
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,225
to function normally
for a while.

338
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:43,103
But there is a great
deal of risk attached.

339
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,898
What sort of risk?

340
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:50,361
In 22 percent of cases,
vasokin has severely damaged

341
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:54,448
patients' lungs,
kidneys, even heart...

342
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,158
sometimes the brain.

343
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,370
In your condition,
it could be fatal.

344
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,708
But it would allow me
to function normally

345
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,710
for the next few days?

346
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,670
Yes.

347
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,715
But why risk your life
for a few days?

348
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,592
(chuckles)

349
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:16,054
I have no great desire to die,
Doctor

350
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,933
but I am determined
to carry out
the will of the Prophets

351
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,559
as long as I am able

352
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,311
and I cannot
carry out their will

353
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:29,316
if I am unconscious
in some stasis tube.

354
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,819
Please...

355
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,323
begin the vasokin
treatments.

356
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,708
All right.

357
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,919
We'll start this afternoon.

358
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,799
I only hope
we don't regret this.

359
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,302
So do I.

360
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:09,565
SISKO:
<i>Station Log, Stardate 48498.4.</i>

361
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,026
<i>Legate Turrel</i>
<i>has arrived aboard the station</i>

362
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,736
<i>to resume the negotiations.</i>

363
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,613
<i>Vedek Bareil suggested</i>

364
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,616
<i>that I sit in on the talks</i>
<i>as an impartial observer</i>

365
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,119
<i>and Kai Winn has agreed.</i>

366
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,954
Perhaps you
didn't hear me.

367
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,247
There<i> are</i> no Bajoran
prisoners left

368
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,583
in Cardassian hands.

369
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,086
Maybe we should redefine
our terms.

370
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:33,047
Perhaps there are
no<i> official</i> prisoners

371
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,675
but are there a number
of, shall we say...

372
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,052
detainees?

373
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:41,639
There are of course people
being detained at
the Justice Ministry

374
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:42,932
for crimes against the state

375
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:45,518
but that is a discussion
for another time.

376
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,228
Now, I would
like to discuss

377
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,356
what you've called
"war reparations."

378
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,566
We would be willing to
pay for the destruction

379
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:56,112
of all Bajoran property
incurred during
our occupation

380
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:59,991
as long as<i> you</i> would be
willing to return to us

381
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,952
all Cardassian
property and equipment

382
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:05,997
left behind on Bajor.

383
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,248
What... sort of property?

384
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,250
I can provide
you with lists

385
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,336
of material, equipment...

386
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,883
as long as we have
an agreement in principle

387
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:20,219
that anything
of Cardassian origin

388
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,639
does still belong
to the Cardassian people.

389
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,810
I... will consider your offer.

390
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:28,978
Good.

391
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,313
Shall we take a recess?

392
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,454
He's up to something.

393
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,293
That much
seems clear.

394
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,462
But what?

395
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:59,717
Why is he insisting on
this principle of his?

396
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,970
I need Bareil.

397
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:07,016
He's the only one who knows
the entire negotiating record.

398
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,769
Bareil has been talking
with Turrel for months.

399
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,562
He understands him...

400
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,813
respects him...

401
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,066
I think he even
likes him.

402
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,401
I'm afraid you may have
to face the possibility

403
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:21,447
that Bareil may not be able
to help you much longer.

404
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,493
I was chosen
by the Prophets

405
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:29,080
to lead our people
into a new era.

406
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,664
I know that!

407
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,541
But I was not meant
to be in a room

408
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,168
with a Cardassian

409
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,047
debating legalisms
and diplomatic nuances.

410
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:46,430
I can't do this
without Bareil.

411
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,390
If he dies...

412
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,727
then peace with Cardassia
dies with him.

413
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,651
(people speaking indistinctly)

414
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,447
LEANNE:
My father used
to take me

415
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,699
to the wilderness
preserves on Vulcan.

416
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,201
So for years

417
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,953
I thought that's what
their planet was like--

418
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,704
animals and plants
everywhere.

419
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,040
I had no idea there
were people on Vulcan.

420
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,583
(laughter)

421
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,878
Boy, Jake, she talks
a lot for a female.

422
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,672
Excuse me!

423
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,216
Riska, weren't
you telling me

424
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,051
your uncle runs a bar
on Osinar VI?

425
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:27,054
You know, Nog's uncle
runs this bar.

426
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,597
Is that right?

427
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,391
Let's not make
foolish conversation.

428
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,770
Just sit thereand look
beautiful.

429
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,897
Nog, what do you
think you're doing?

430
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,399
I think I know
how to handle females.

431
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,821
Jake, you know,
I've been thinking...

432
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,614
after we're done eating

433
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,783
we could take the females
to the holosuites.

434
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:51,996
I've borrowed one of my
uncle's private programs.

435
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:52,997
(chuckles)

436
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,582
"The massacre
on Ferris VI."

437
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,126
We could spend an hour

438
00:22:57,168 --> 00:23:00,462
pillaging and looting
the frightened townspeople.

439
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,964
I don't think so.

440
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:04,675
NOG:
No one's<i> asking you</i>
<i>to think,</i> my dear.

441
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,636
Here, make
yourself useful.

442
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,387
Cut up my food
for me.

443
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,140
You must be joking.

444
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:15,477
(laughs)

445
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,522
(all laugh)

446
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:25,403
She's so dumb!

447
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,198
She's perfect!

448
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,741
That's it.

449
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,370
(sighs)

450
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,662
JAKE: Wait.

451
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,164
You're not leaving?

452
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:36,749
I suppose you want me
to sit here

453
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,167
and cut your food for you, too?

454
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:39,960
I never said anything
about cutting...

455
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:44,257
I hope you and your friend
enjoy your holosuite.

456
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:46,300
Come on.

457
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:53,766
Nog!

458
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,184
Don't say
another word, Jake.

459
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,685
I think you've done enough
damage for one night!

460
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:57,853
Me?

461
00:23:57,895 --> 00:23:59,272
Yeah, you--
you were treating

462
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,607
my female
as if she was an equal!

463
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,276
And you were behaving
like an idiot.

464
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,527
This is the last time
I'll ever do a favor for you.

465
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,196
From now on,
you get your own dates.

466
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:09,907
And you can find someone else
to play dom-jot with!

467
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,284
Fine!

468
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:12,492
Good!

469
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:25,547
Turrel... is trying to get
a concession from you

470
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,801
that I already rejected.

471
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,261
Tell him...

472
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,263
that the question

473
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:35,057
of Cardassian
property on Bajor

474
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,726
was already dealt with...

475
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:39,979
in the armistice talks
four years ago.

476
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,105
I--

477
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,481
Don't... don't worry.

478
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:47,111
He'll... he'll still
pay the reparations.

479
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:50,239
What about this question
of mining rights?

480
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:52,825
(gasping)

481
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,660
His attention
is wandering.

482
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:55,911
He's in pain.

483
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:57,495
Give him more of the drug.

484
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:58,872
He's had enough.

485
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,833
Then you'll need to give
him something else.

486
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,335
The negotiations resume

487
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:06,255
in less than six hours
and we still have 40 pages!

488
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:07,714
BASHIR:
Listen to me.

489
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,383
I don't care
about your negotiations

490
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,677
and I don't care
about your treaty.

491
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,429
All I care about
is my patient

492
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:16,140
and at the moment,
he needs more
treatment and less politics.

493
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:17,933
Now, you can either
leave here willingly

494
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,101
or I'll call
Security

495
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:20,894
and have you
thrown out.

496
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,980
You won't need
to call them.

497
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,398
I'll do it
myself.

498
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,614
Put yourself in the hands
of the Prophets, Bareil.

499
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,658
They will not forsake you.

500
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,370
Yes, Eminence.

501
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,379
Is there anything
I can do?

502
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,882
Just be here.

503
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:57,014
(sighs)

504
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,807
I'm beginning
to dislike

505
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:01,810
seeing that look
on your face, Doctor.

506
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,230
As I feared

507
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:07,024
the vasokin has already
damaged your internal organs.

508
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,444
What happens now?

509
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:14,114
I can replace
the damaged organs
with artificial implants

510
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,699
but as long
as you're taking the drug

511
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,993
I can't guarantee
that the damage
won't spread.

512
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,328
I think you
should reconsider

513
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,871
letting me put you
in stasis.

514
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,418
I'm afraid my mind's made up.

515
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,839
Just get me through
the negotiations.

516
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,174
I must carry out

517
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:34,093
the will of
the Prophets.

518
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,303
Please...

519
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,182
whatever it takes...

520
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,309
just do it.

521
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,447
(door opens)

522
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,915
Are you going
to call Security

523
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:05,958
and have me removed

524
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,668
from<i> this</i> room
now, Doctor?

525
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,547
It hadn't occurred
to me... yet.

526
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,384
How is Bareil?

527
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:17,553
The organ replacement
surgery went well.

528
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:18,720
He's still unconscious

529
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,473
but he should be awake
within the hour.

530
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:22,475
Oh, good.

531
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:24,310
There are still
several points

532
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,643
I have to discuss
with him

533
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:28,522
before the next
negotiating session.

534
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,399
That's why I'm here.

535
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,028
When you see Bareil

536
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,948
I want you to tell him
that you don't need him.

537
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,576
That you can complete these
negotiations without him.

538
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:42,578
But I<i> do</i> need him, Doctor.

539
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,121
I realize that.

540
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,999
But I want you to tell him
that you don't.

541
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,919
You seem to be
asking me to lie.

542
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:54,423
I'm asking you to free Bareil
of his obligations to you.

543
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:55,799
The only way
he'll accept that

544
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,926
is if you tell him
he's no longer needed--

545
00:27:57,968 --> 00:28:00,513
that you can go on without him.

546
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:04,850
Now, if that's a lie,
then so be it.

547
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:09,855
That doesn't sound
like a...<i> Starfleet</i> officer.

548
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,565
I'm a doctor first.

549
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:12,858
And right now, I'm trying

550
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,277
to give my patient
his best chance to live.

551
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,613
The only way to do that
is to put him in stasis.

552
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:19,281
Bareil knows that

553
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:22,034
but his desire to complete
these negotiations is so strong

554
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,828
that he's forcing me
to keep him conscious
and mentally alert

555
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,455
even though it may kill him.

556
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:28,957
None of us wants that
to happen, Doctor.

557
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,337
But, if I'm not mistaken

558
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:37,174
the decision regarding
Bareil's treatment
is up to him.

559
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,717
Yes.

560
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:42,762
As the patient, it is his right
to make that choice

561
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:47,309
but I am asking you
to help me change his mind.

562
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,820
Eminence...

563
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,824
you're the Kai.

564
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,743
These are your
negotiations.

565
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,537
Let this be your
moment in history.

566
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,121
Finish the talks
on your own

567
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:11,791
and you won't have to share
the credit with anyone.

568
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:15,629
You say that as though success
is guaranteed.

569
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,007
Of course...

570
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:24,012
if the talks fail, you'll need
someone to accept the blame--

571
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,265
a scapegoat.

572
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,308
You're a coward.

573
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,144
You're afraid
to stand alone.

574
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,607
Bareil's already made
his decision, Doctor.

575
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:36,942
I won't interfere.

576
00:29:39,737 --> 00:29:41,280
And, Doctor...

577
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,704
I won't forget
what you've said here.

578
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,415
Neither will I.

579
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,257
So, you never told me
about your double date.

580
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,509
Not much to tell.

581
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:03,885
That's not what I hear.

582
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,220
Quark tells me that you
and Nog aren't speaking

583
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:06,555
to each other.

584
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:08,474
You should have seen
the way he acted, Dad.

585
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,643
He was acting
like a spoiled brat.

586
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:13,186
I've never been so embarrassed.

587
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,564
I don't think Leanne
will ever speak to me again.

588
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:17,107
Hmm, so what did he do?

589
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,025
All kinds of
stupid things.

590
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,360
Riska couldn't even
say two words

591
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,362
without him telling her
to be quiet.

592
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:25,907
And he insisted that she cut up
his food for him.

593
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,910
He was treating her
like she was
some kind of slave.

594
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,789
It sounds like he's acting
like a Ferengi to me.

595
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,332
You can't blame him for that.

596
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,542
Well, in that case, maybe
you were right all along.

597
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:36,752
About what?

598
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:38,211
You once said that
humans and Ferengis

599
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,298
are too different to ever
really be friends.

600
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,051
I remember saying that,
and you know what?

601
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,179
I was wrong.

602
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,514
You and Nog proved that.

603
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,307
Sure, you have
your cultural differences

604
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,225
but there's a real bond
between you.

605
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:55,479
Well, I know one thing.

606
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,230
I'm never going to set him up
on a date again.

607
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,359
I think the two of you
should talk this over

608
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,028
before it becomes
too big a problem.

609
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:06,865
I'm not sure Nog is going to be
willing to talk to me so soon.

610
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:11,161
Well, I guess you'll have to do
something to get his attention.

611
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,960
(gasping and groaning)

612
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,004
What happened?

613
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,506
I don't know.

614
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:23,757
Two cc's morphenolog.

615
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:24,966
It's all right.

616
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,218
It's all right.
You're getting help.

617
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,344
You're getting help.

618
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:28,970
I thought I made it clear

619
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,013
there were to be no visitors
for the next three hours!

620
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,390
It's not her fault, Doctor.

621
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,266
Bareil called me himself.

622
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,810
He said he had some ideas
on the treaty.

623
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:36,269
And you just
couldn't wait

624
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,646
to hear them,
could you?

625
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,566
His left temporal lobe

626
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,941
is showing signs
of massive synaptic failure.

627
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,026
Well, I hope you got
all the advice

628
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,778
you needed, Eminence

629
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,363
because the vasokin
has damaged his brain

630
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,448
and that damage
is irreversible.

631
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,381
Will he regain
consciousness?

632
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,966
Not in his
present condition.

633
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,427
You were able
to replace

634
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,846
some of his
internal organs

635
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:12,806
with artificial implants.

636
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:15,100
Could you do
something similar

637
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,394
with the damaged
parts of his brain?

638
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,354
It's hard to say
with any certainty.

639
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:20,939
There's still a great deal

640
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,483
about the way
the brain operates
we don't understand.

641
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,944
One of my professors
at medical school used to say

642
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:29,281
that the brain has a "spark of
life" that can't be replicated.

643
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:32,367
If we begin to replace
parts of Bareil's brain

644
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:36,496
with artificial implants,
that spark may be lost.

645
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,498
But you're saying,
if you don't do it,

646
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,376
Bareil will never regain
consciousness and he'll die.

647
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,129
SISKO: I think
we should consider

648
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,715
what Bareil
would want us to do.

649
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:48,007
WINN:
Bareil wanted

650
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,927
these negotiations
to be completed

651
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,804
no matter
what the cost.

652
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:54,431
BASHIR:
With all due respect,
Your Eminence

653
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,642
you're hardly
an impartial observer here.

654
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,102
You have a personal interest
in these talks.

655
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:00,771
(sighs)

656
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:04,524
There is more at stake
than one man's life.

657
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:09,571
One man's life is all I'm
concerned with at the moment.

658
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:11,865
I think she's right, Julian.

659
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,159
I think Bareil

660
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,202
would want
the positronic implants.

661
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,080
Kira, if I go through with this

662
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,500
the man who wakes up may not be
the man you used to know.

663
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:25,712
I realize that... but I know
how important this is to him

664
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,631
and I know he wouldn't want

665
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:30,342
to just be put
in stasis indefinitely

666
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:34,554
waiting for some medical
solution that may never come.

667
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,640
Do the surgery, Julian.

668
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:38,725
Let him finish what he started.

669
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:48,527
Mr. Sisko?

670
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,445
Odo, I'd like you
to do me a favor.

671
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:51,571
Hmm?

672
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:52,990
I want to be arrested.

673
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:57,953
Ah! This is outrageous!

674
00:33:57,995 --> 00:33:59,037
I didn't steal anything

675
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,455
from the Tholian
Ambassador!

676
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:01,915
Just another innocent man

677
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:04,417
arrested for a crime
he didn't commit.

678
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,878
What is<i> he</i> doing here?

679
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,921
As if you didn't know.

680
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,674
Your accomplice here
has also denied involvement

681
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:13,092
but I have an eyewitness
who saw both of you

682
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,970
breaking into
the Tholian Ambassador's

683
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:16,304
quarters last night.

684
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:18,849
I don't even know
what a Tholian looks like!

685
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,394
Tell it
to the magistrate.

686
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,854
(yells)

687
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:25,564
At least put me
in my own cell!

688
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,107
I'm sorry the quarters
aren't to your liking.

689
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:31,444
Please feel free to submit
a complaint to the management.

690
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,989
(hisses)

691
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,539
The positronic implant
is functioning normally.

692
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:46,043
And the midbrain interface
is on line and he's awake.

693
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:54,968
Bareil.

694
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,263
Yes, Major?

695
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,681
How are you feeling?

696
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,434
Awake.

697
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,772
Everything is different.

698
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,066
Different?

699
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,484
In what way?

700
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,405
It's hard to explain...

701
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,243
but when you touch me

702
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,121
it doesn't seem real.

703
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,794
It's more like
the distant memory of a touch.

704
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:36,093
Vedek, do you remember
the negotiations?

705
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,428
I have some
questions for you.

706
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,555
BAREIL: Of course,
Eminence.

707
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,557
I will do all that I can.

708
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,239
Something's wrong.

709
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,574
No kidding.

710
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,868
That's not what I mean.

711
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:05,413
My father told me that if I
got caught stealing again

712
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:07,040
he would send me back

713
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:09,459
to live on the Ferengi
homeworld
with my grandmother.

714
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,252
(scoffs)

715
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:14,006
So where is he?

716
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:17,467
I mean, why isn't he here
yelling and threatening me?

717
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,805
And where's Uncle Quark?

718
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,389
Now, I'm late for work.

719
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,896
And come to think of it,
what are<i> you</i> doing here?

720
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,315
Ask Odo.

721
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,359
No, no, no,
throwing you in here

722
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,112
wasn't Odo's idea.

723
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:40,949
You don't just arrest
the Station Commander's son

724
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:44,077
without some
really strong evidence.

725
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:46,579
And I know there
is no evidence

726
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:50,375
because<i> I</i> know we
didn't do anything.

727
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,918
So why are we in here, Jake?

728
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,503
All right,
I put Odo up to this

729
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:54,921
because I wanted
to talk to you.

730
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,297
In<i> here?</i>

731
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,216
I didn't think you'd
listen to me otherwise.

732
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:00,802
Well, this better be good.

733
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:03,889
2I wanted to say
I'm sorry.

734
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,141
I guess I just forgot
you were a Ferengi.

735
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:07,475
You forgot?

736
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:10,311
To most people, the lobes
are a dead giveaway.

737
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,437
What I mean is

738
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,106
we spend so much
time together

739
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,358
and we seem so much alike

740
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,611
I, I sometimes forget
we're different.

741
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:23,116
I know we're different.

742
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:25,035
I mean, anyone
who talks to a female

743
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:27,996
with fawning respect
is no Ferengi.

744
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:30,456
It made me sick.

745
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,626
You want to talk
about sick?

746
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:37,214
Sick is making Riska
cut up your food for you.

747
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,882
Well, at least I didn't
have her chew it.

748
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:39,716
Chew it!

749
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:40,967
That's right.

750
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,930
In traditional
Ferengi homes

751
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,473
the females soften the
food with their teeth

752
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:50,060
before they give it
to the males.

753
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:51,686
That is disgusting.

754
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:53,312
I knew you would
react that way

755
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,607
which is why I did
not have her do it.

756
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,109
Well, do you have
any other

757
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,317
disgusting Ferengi customs

758
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,318
I should know about?

759
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,862
Plenty.

760
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:03,823
And I know plenty of human
customs which disgust me.

761
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,494
Great, so we both
disgust each other.

762
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,746
You know, as we get older

763
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,957
this is just going
to get worse.

764
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,416
But I know one thing

765
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,086
I don't want to lose you
as a friend.

766
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,422
Well, in that case

767
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,591
double-dating
is definitely out.

768
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:22,717
Agreed.

769
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:24,219
And I guess
we'll just have to deal

770
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:26,345
with the rest
of our disgusting habits

771
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,639
as they come up.

772
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,015
I guess so.

773
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,602
You feel better?

774
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:33,519
Yeah.

775
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,729
Good.

776
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,233
Now can we get
out of here?

777
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:39,484
Sure.

778
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:43,321
Odo?

779
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,740
Odo.

780
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,534
He-He's just playing around.

781
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,164
Odo?
Odo!

782
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:55,167
SISKO:
<i>Station Log, supplemental.</i>

783
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,709
<i>Kai Winn has announced</i>

784
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,586
<i>that Legate Turrel has signed</i>
<i>the peace treaty.</i>

785
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:01,923
<i>The news has sent a shockwave</i>
<i>throughout the quadrant.</i>

786
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,134
<i>And although there is</i>
<i>still some opposition</i>

787
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:07,595
<i>from hard-line elements</i>
<i>on both Bajor and Cardassia</i>

788
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,722
<i>it looks as though</i>
<i>they are finally willing</i>

789
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,642
<i>to put their long conflict</i>
<i>behind them.</i>

790
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:22,277
Remind me not to invite
you to my next party.

791
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,403
I'm sorry.

792
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:27,240
I guess I'm sort of casting
a pall over this gathering.

793
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,117
Julian, no one's
expecting you

794
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:30,910
to provide
entertainment

795
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,662
but you should try
to enjoy yourself.

796
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:33,788
After all, the celebration

797
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,123
is for you, too.

798
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:38,417
Well, frankly,
I can't imagine

799
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,338
what I've done...
deserves a celebration.

800
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:45,175
You kept him alive
against incredible odds.

801
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:46,718
No matter what happens

802
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,012
you should always
be proud of that.

803
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,811
Hi...

804
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,437
Excuse me.

805
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:59,647
Your Eminence.

806
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,066
Yes?

807
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:06,029
Kai Winn, allow me to
introduce "Kai Winn."

808
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:07,947
WINN:
I don't understand.

809
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,490
QUARK:
In honor of the occasion

810
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:13,494
I've named my latest
creation after you.

811
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:17,415
It's a chocolate
soufflé with...

812
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,586
Haligian tongue sauce.

813
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:24,172
Well, I'm very honored.

814
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:29,261
Mmm... mmm.

815
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:31,221
And you're also
very popular.

816
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:33,056
Believe me,
I can't keep up

817
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:34,599
with the orders
so far!

818
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,808
(chuckling)

819
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,645
NURSE ON PA:
<i>Medical emergency.</i>

820
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,856
<i>Dr. Bashir to the Infirmary.</i>

821
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,944
Please excuse me.

822
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:50,031
KIRA: It's the other half
of his brain, isn't it?

823
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:51,783
But you can still help him,
can't you?

824
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,952
You can replace
the other half of his brain

825
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:56,162
with a positronic matrix.

826
00:40:56,204 --> 00:41:00,166
I'm sorry, Nerys,
but this is where it ends.

827
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,626
What do you mean?

828
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,211
I won't remove whatever

829
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:05,964
last shred of humanity
Bareil has left.

830
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:08,591
But you<i> can</i> do it.

831
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:09,968
Perhaps, child

832
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,553
it is time to listen
to Dr. Bashir.

833
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:15,223
Sure. You got
your peace treaty

834
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:16,933
your place in history.

835
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:19,685
You don't need
Bareil anymore.

836
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:23,189
Believe me, child,
I share your pain...

837
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,693
but I think the Prophets
are calling to Bareil.

838
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:31,697
I will see to it that
Bajor never forgets him.

839
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,076
Doctor.

840
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:50,008
Julian... you can't
give up now.

841
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,843
You have to keep going.

842
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:55,763
Nerys...

843
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:59,976
if I remove
the rest of his brain

844
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,978
and replace it with a machine

845
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:08,818
he may look like Bareil,
he may even talk like Bareil

846
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,404
but he won't be Bareil.

847
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,323
That "spark of life"
will be gone.

848
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:14,699
He'll be dead.

849
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,869
And I'll be the one
who killed him.

850
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,332
But if we do nothing,
he'll die.

851
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,751
That's right, he will.

852
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:29,088
But he'll die like a man,
not a machine.

853
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,300
Please...

854
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:35,594
don't make me
fight you on this one.

855
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,806
Just let him go.

856
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,981
How much time?

857
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:51,110
All brain activity should cease
within the next three hours.

858
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,782
I'd like to stay
with him till then.

859
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,118
Of course.

860
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,882
You got your peace treaty.

861
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:18,971
I just wish
that we'd had more time for us.

862
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:22,350
There's so much
I never told you, but...

863
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:29,399
this is the time we have left,
so I'd better say it now.

864
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,079
(sniffles)

865
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:51,629
I'll... I'll never forget
the first time I saw you

866
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:55,300
the day you came
to the station.

867
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:59,011
You had... such a...

868
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:02,681
serenity about you
I thought you had
all the answers.

869
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:06,478
It really got on my nerves
for a while.

870
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,231
Then I got to know you and I...

871
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:15,236
realized you were
just as confused
as the rest of us.

872
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,491
You just accepted
your confusion

873
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:22,910
better than anyone
I've ever known.

874
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:27,873
That's when I realized
I loved you.

875
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:41,137
(music playing)
