1
00:00:13,826 --> 00:00:15,090
Jake!

2
00:00:15,196 --> 00:00:16,791
Hi!

3
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:19,306
Leanne, I thought
you were on Bajor.

4
00:00:19,341 --> 00:00:21,745
I came back early.

5
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:25,450
You know, I was just
thinking about you.

6
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,584
Really?

7
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,598
Yeah, I passed
the Klingon restaurant

8
00:00:28,632 --> 00:00:30,569
where you and I and Orak
were eating dinner...

9
00:00:30,603 --> 00:00:32,129
And you ordered the <i>gagh.</i>

10
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:33,140
Yeah. How is Orak?

11
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:34,712
I haven't talked
to him in a while.

12
00:00:34,748 --> 00:00:38,281
We, uh, stopped seeing
each other a few weeks ago.

13
00:00:38,323 --> 00:00:40,123
- Oh.
- Yeah.

14
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:47,474
So, are... you doing
anything tomorrow night?

15
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:50,420
Well, I'm supposed
to play dom-jot with Nog.

16
00:00:50,455 --> 00:00:51,754
Oh.

17
00:00:51,792 --> 00:00:53,626
But they're not
really firm plans.

18
00:00:53,663 --> 00:00:55,657
In fact, I was thinking
of canceling them.

19
00:00:55,702 --> 00:00:56,671
Really?

20
00:00:56,705 --> 00:00:58,106
If you do cancel

21
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,078
would you be interested
in dinner?

22
00:01:00,113 --> 00:01:01,582
Sure.

23
00:01:01,617 --> 00:01:02,586
Great.

24
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,318
How about 1800
at the Klingon restaurant?

25
00:01:04,358 --> 00:01:05,622
I'll be there.

26
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:08,156
But this time,
we'll skip the <i>gagh.</i>

27
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,364
Definitely.

28
00:01:10,406 --> 00:01:12,172
I'll see you then.

29
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:13,544
Okay.

30
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:18,694
Move aside!

31
00:01:18,728 --> 00:01:19,719
Look out!

32
00:01:21,402 --> 00:01:22,894
Move! Move!

33
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,216
What have we got?

34
00:01:30,258 --> 00:01:31,420
Bajoran transport coming in.

35
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:33,159
They had some kind
of accident on board.

36
00:01:33,199 --> 00:01:34,168
They got casualties.

37
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:35,170
They're docking.

38
00:01:35,204 --> 00:01:36,230
We should have
beamed the wounded

39
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:37,240
directly to the infirmary.

40
00:01:37,276 --> 00:01:38,245
They have
a loose plasma coil.

41
00:01:38,312 --> 00:01:39,611
We couldn't beam
through the radiation.

42
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:40,743
Docking clamps secure.

43
00:01:40,785 --> 00:01:42,619
I'm opening the airlock.
Stand back.

44
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,879
Come on.

45
00:01:51,914 --> 00:01:52,883
This way.

46
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,215
This way.

47
00:01:55,356 --> 00:01:56,289
It's all right.

48
00:01:56,393 --> 00:01:57,623
Here, I've got you.

49
00:01:57,663 --> 00:01:58,723
It's all right.

50
00:01:58,766 --> 00:02:00,133
Come along now.
Come on.

51
00:02:00,169 --> 00:02:02,698
This way, Eminence.

52
00:02:02,742 --> 00:02:04,645
Kai Winn.

53
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:07,119
The Vedek... take care
of the Vedek.

54
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:15,497
Odo to Kira.

55
00:02:15,543 --> 00:02:16,876
Kira here.

56
00:02:16,913 --> 00:02:19,147
I think you should meet us
in the Infirmary, Major.

57
00:02:19,185 --> 00:02:21,247
Vedek Bareil
was on the transport.

58
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,851
He's been injured.

59
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:33,210
The report
from the transport, sir.

60
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,446
Give me the short version.

61
00:04:34,553 --> 00:04:37,459
There was a molecular fracture
in one of the plasma conduits.

62
00:04:37,493 --> 00:04:39,464
It was only a matter of time
before it gave way.

63
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:40,627
Once it collapsed

64
00:04:40,668 --> 00:04:42,263
the entire relay
system exploded.

65
00:04:42,306 --> 00:04:44,004
Was it sabotage?

66
00:04:44,044 --> 00:04:45,308
I don't think so.

67
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:47,616
Why would you suspect sabotage?

68
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:52,361
I would prefer to discuss that
with the Emissary in private.

69
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,972
Put a pressor field
on that artery.

70
00:05:08,006 --> 00:05:10,136
The arterial disruption
is too severe.

71
00:05:10,178 --> 00:05:12,480
The pressor can't stop
the hemorrhaging.

72
00:05:12,518 --> 00:05:14,044
All right, clamp off the artery

73
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:16,653
and then increase the
plasma level to maximum.

74
00:05:17,698 --> 00:05:18,860
Cardiac arrest.

75
00:05:20,037 --> 00:05:21,438
Clear.

76
00:05:22,544 --> 00:05:23,638
Clear.

77
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,310
He can't take
much more of that.

78
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:27,983
The arterial pressure
is falling.

79
00:05:28,025 --> 00:05:29,255
I see it.

80
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,289
The neurotransmitter levels
are falling, too.

81
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,734
Two cc's cordrazine.

82
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:34,104
Doctor?

83
00:05:34,141 --> 00:05:35,701
Do it.

84
00:05:40,357 --> 00:05:41,417
Synaptic failure.

85
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:43,988
Apply direct neurostimulation
to the brain stem.

86
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,281
Thank you.

87
00:05:54,293 --> 00:05:56,788
Vedek Bareil
and I were on our way

88
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,895
to a secret meeting
with a member

89
00:05:58,938 --> 00:06:01,206
of the Cardassian
Central Command.

90
00:06:01,244 --> 00:06:03,181
It was my intention
to open talks

91
00:06:03,216 --> 00:06:06,554
between Bajor and Cardassia
that would lead to a treaty

92
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:09,497
and a final peace settlement.

93
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:12,870
You have been negotiating
peace with Cardassia?

94
00:06:12,908 --> 00:06:14,400
The Prophets teach us

95
00:06:14,445 --> 00:06:18,080
that while violence
may keep an enemy at bay

96
00:06:18,121 --> 00:06:21,425
only peace
can make him a friend.

97
00:06:21,463 --> 00:06:23,491
How long has this been going on?

98
00:06:23,536 --> 00:06:25,062
Vedek Bareil has
been working to set up

99
00:06:25,106 --> 00:06:28,570
this meeting with Legate Turrel
for the past five months.

100
00:06:28,616 --> 00:06:32,251
They've discussed issues
ranging from war reparations

101
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,594
to the exchange of Ambassadors.

102
00:06:34,631 --> 00:06:37,263
There's even the possibility

103
00:06:37,305 --> 00:06:41,874
that the Cardassians
will issue a formal apology

104
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:45,653
for the pain and suffering
inflicted on the Bajoran people

105
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,229
during the occupation.

106
00:06:47,264 --> 00:06:50,865
I was on my way to our first
face-to-face meeting

107
00:06:50,906 --> 00:06:53,606
when we had the accident.

108
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:56,119
Please, don't take this
the wrong way

109
00:06:56,154 --> 00:06:59,926
but I never would have guessed
that you would be the one

110
00:06:59,963 --> 00:07:03,096
to bring such a bold vision
of peace to Bajor.

111
00:07:03,138 --> 00:07:06,636
A large share of the credit
goes to Vedek Bareil.

112
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:10,623
Without him, the talks could
have never come this far.

113
00:07:10,658 --> 00:07:12,652
It sounds like you've developed

114
00:07:12,696 --> 00:07:15,168
a deeper appreciation
for Vedek Bareil.

115
00:07:15,203 --> 00:07:20,582
I must admit, he has been
a loyal and trustworthy aide

116
00:07:20,617 --> 00:07:22,554
since the election.

117
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:26,588
I'm not sure I could have been
as... forgiving

118
00:07:26,632 --> 00:07:28,158
had I been in his place.

119
00:07:28,203 --> 00:07:31,143
These talks
were Bareil's idea.

120
00:07:31,178 --> 00:07:33,707
He's guided me through them

121
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:39,323
and without him, in the future,
these talks may never resume.

122
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:52,457
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,442
The radiation severely damaged
his neural pathways.

124
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,914
I did everything I could.

125
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,286
I know you did.

126
00:08:01,323 --> 00:08:03,487
Did he ever regain
consciousness?

127
00:08:03,528 --> 00:08:06,593
No, I don't think he suffered.

128
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:08,196
Thank you, Doctor.

129
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:10,178
I'm... on duty in Ops.

130
00:08:10,212 --> 00:08:11,272
Excuse me.

131
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:12,682
Kira...

132
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:16,991
I think they can get along
without you in Ops today.

133
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,163
Maybe, but I need to be there.

134
00:08:20,205 --> 00:08:22,039
I appreciate your concern

135
00:08:22,076 --> 00:08:25,517
but I'll grieve in my own way,
in my own time.

136
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,180
We're ready to begin
the autopsy, Doctor.

137
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,198
Release the stasis field.

138
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,233
Let's begin with a neural scan.

139
00:09:00,275 --> 00:09:02,713
I want to map
his central axonal pathways.

140
00:09:02,749 --> 00:09:05,347
Find out where
the breakdown began.

141
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:13,003
Shall I begin taking
neural tissue samples?

142
00:09:16,418 --> 00:09:19,722
Looks like the damage began
in the parietal lobe.

143
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,597
Spread through the rest of the
brain in a retrograde manner.

144
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:26,875
Wait a minute.

145
00:09:26,945 --> 00:09:30,614
A neuron just fired
in his cerebral cortex.

146
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:36,333
There it is again.

147
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:38,898
His nerves, his nerves
are still transmitting

148
00:09:38,943 --> 00:09:40,743
electrical impulses
to his brain.

149
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:41,772
How can that be?

150
00:09:41,816 --> 00:09:43,514
His brain activity is zero.

151
00:09:43,554 --> 00:09:46,722
His nervous system
should be completely inactive.

152
00:09:46,762 --> 00:09:48,163
I don't know,
but it means his body's

153
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,932
still capable of sending
messages to the brain

154
00:09:50,038 --> 00:09:52,806
even though the brain
can't process them.

155
00:09:52,845 --> 00:09:54,337
The radiation he was exposed to

156
00:09:54,382 --> 00:09:56,877
might have fortified
his peripheral cell membranes.

157
00:09:58,861 --> 00:10:02,633
If we can regenerate
his pathways

158
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:06,477
with his own neuron cells,
we might be able to revive him.

159
00:10:06,514 --> 00:10:08,074
What about brain damage?

160
00:10:08,118 --> 00:10:11,456
There's been no oxygen to his
brain for almost 40 minutes.

161
00:10:11,494 --> 00:10:13,522
But he's been in stasis
for most of that time.

162
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:15,161
That, combined
with the strengthening

163
00:10:15,204 --> 00:10:17,540
of his cell membranes might
buy us the time we need.

164
00:10:19,047 --> 00:10:21,246
We'll have to direct a burst
of electrical energy

165
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:23,279
into his cerebral cortex.

166
00:10:25,998 --> 00:10:30,237
If the burst is
the proper intensity

167
00:10:30,276 --> 00:10:33,148
it should create a cascade
effect within the brain

168
00:10:33,183 --> 00:10:39,028
and the neurons might resume
their normal firing pattern.

169
00:10:39,065 --> 00:10:40,432
Okay.

170
00:10:40,469 --> 00:10:43,375
Let's close up
the cranial cavity.

171
00:11:03,762 --> 00:11:06,257
The neurogenic stimulator
is in place.

172
00:11:06,302 --> 00:11:08,398
Let's try a 50-millivolt burst.

173
00:11:11,248 --> 00:11:13,743
Increase it to 60.

174
00:11:18,434 --> 00:11:19,733
Seventy.

175
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:23,109
That's five millivolts above
what normal tissue can stand.

176
00:11:23,213 --> 00:11:25,515
It'll burn out
his cerebral cortex.

177
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:27,021
If I'm right,
the inaprovaline drug

178
00:11:27,057 --> 00:11:29,325
that I gave him should
provide additional resistance

179
00:11:29,362 --> 00:11:31,026
against the excess
electrostimulation.

180
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:32,058
Seventy!

181
00:11:34,576 --> 00:11:36,479
Doctor!

182
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,167
Well, it's
a little early to tell

183
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:48,339
but I'm hoping
he'll make a full recovery.

184
00:11:48,381 --> 00:11:51,081
He should be back on his feet
again in a few weeks.

185
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:52,989
You say that so calmly.

186
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:54,256
But it's not every doctor

187
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,358
that can lose a patient,
and then have him

188
00:11:56,401 --> 00:11:58,099
back on his feet
in a few weeks.

189
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:00,634
Indeed, you are too modest.

190
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:04,051
You've performed nothing
less than a miracle here.

191
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:06,618
The Prophets must walk
with you, Doctor.

192
00:12:06,662 --> 00:12:08,896
Well, I and the Prophets
were lucky

193
00:12:08,934 --> 00:12:12,398
that the ionizing radiation
left a residual signature

194
00:12:12,443 --> 00:12:13,878
on Bareil's axonal pathways.

195
00:12:13,914 --> 00:12:15,851
That's what really
made this possible.

196
00:12:15,886 --> 00:12:21,458
Whoever deserves the credit,
Doctor, I am grateful.

197
00:12:21,501 --> 00:12:23,404
And I am grateful

198
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:26,037
you were not taken from us,
Vedek Bareil.

199
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,551
My work here
is not yet finished.

200
00:12:28,585 --> 00:12:29,713
No...

201
00:12:29,755 --> 00:12:30,985
it is not.

202
00:12:31,025 --> 00:12:33,965
We must resume
the negotiations immediately.

203
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:37,532
We can't risk losing
the momentum we've established.

204
00:12:37,575 --> 00:12:40,047
I would like to send
a coded message

205
00:12:40,082 --> 00:12:44,185
to Legate Turrel,
and invite him to come to DS9

206
00:12:44,226 --> 00:12:45,593
to continue the talks.

207
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:46,928
Wait a minute.

208
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:50,236
Bareil's in no condition
to conduct negotiations.

209
00:12:50,274 --> 00:12:53,112
Bareil will simply
be advising me.

210
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:55,987
I will conduct the actual talks.

211
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,532
Then I'll allow it as long
as your visits don't tire him.

212
00:13:00,568 --> 00:13:02,664
Agreed.

213
00:13:02,707 --> 00:13:06,171
Vedek, we will talk again soon.

214
00:13:06,216 --> 00:13:07,948
Eminence.

215
00:13:14,104 --> 00:13:15,699
So...

216
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:20,883
are we going to be playing
springball next month?

217
00:13:20,921 --> 00:13:26,459
You bet, although I'm afraid I
might have an unfair advantage.

218
00:13:26,502 --> 00:13:30,137
You mean, playing
against a dead man?

219
00:13:30,178 --> 00:13:32,149
No.

220
00:13:32,183 --> 00:13:34,382
I've been practicing.

221
00:13:42,143 --> 00:13:44,945
My dad said that you
were looking for me.

222
00:13:44,984 --> 00:13:47,479
Yeah, um, it's
about tomorrow night.

223
00:13:47,524 --> 00:13:48,493
Don't worry.

224
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,555
I've all ready
taken care of that.

225
00:13:50,598 --> 00:13:52,330
I met these three Terrellians

226
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,674
who were bragging about
how great they are at dom-jot.

227
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:58,206
So I arranged a game...
us against them.

228
00:13:59,254 --> 00:14:00,587
Look, Nog, we have
a-a little problem.

229
00:14:00,624 --> 00:14:01,752
No, we don't.

230
00:14:01,794 --> 00:14:03,594
I guarantee we'll beat them.

231
00:14:03,632 --> 00:14:04,601
It's not that.

232
00:14:04,634 --> 00:14:06,764
I just can't make it
tomorrow night.

233
00:14:06,807 --> 00:14:08,037
But it has to be

234
00:14:08,077 --> 00:14:10,276
tomorrow night...
they're leaving the next day.

235
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,686
I-I made other plans.

236
00:14:12,755 --> 00:14:16,025
What could be more
important than dom-jot?

237
00:14:16,065 --> 00:14:18,299
I have a date.

238
00:14:18,337 --> 00:14:22,302
Oh, well, that's different.

239
00:14:22,348 --> 00:14:23,374
It is?

240
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:26,288
Yeah. Money is money

241
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:29,321
but women are better.

242
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:31,861
Is that a Rule of Acquisition?

243
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:33,272
It's a personal rule.

244
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:35,679
So, who is she?

245
00:14:35,715 --> 00:14:36,945
Leanne.

246
00:14:36,985 --> 00:14:38,147
Ah, Leanne!

247
00:14:38,188 --> 00:14:39,487
Ah!
Way to go, Jake!

248
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:42,157
So, what is the name of my date?

249
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:44,169
I hope she's as cute as Leanne.

250
00:14:44,203 --> 00:14:45,331
Your date?

251
00:14:45,373 --> 00:14:47,139
She has a friend, right?

252
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,408
I'm sure she does.

253
00:14:48,448 --> 00:14:50,784
Then tell her
to bring her along.

254
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:53,452
Nog, that's not
what I had in mind.

255
00:14:53,494 --> 00:14:55,658
That's because
you were confused.

256
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:58,299
Would you rather
the three of us go out?

257
00:14:58,341 --> 00:15:00,107
When you put it that way...

258
00:15:00,145 --> 00:15:02,013
Exactly.

259
00:15:02,785 --> 00:15:05,314
Just one thing, Jake.

260
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:08,527
You're still pretty new
at this dating business.

261
00:15:08,567 --> 00:15:12,202
Just promise me you won't
do anything to embarrass me.

262
00:15:13,814 --> 00:15:15,010
I'll do my best.

263
00:15:15,051 --> 00:15:17,580
Ah, this'll be great.

264
00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:20,689
Maybe I'll even wash my lobes.

265
00:15:22,002 --> 00:15:24,440
I suggest we put off discussion

266
00:15:24,475 --> 00:15:27,347
of the Cardassians
returning the Orbs

267
00:15:27,382 --> 00:15:31,256
until diplomatic relations
have been established.

268
00:15:31,293 --> 00:15:34,529
That would only delay
an inevitable argument.

269
00:15:34,568 --> 00:15:38,135
But it will give the peace
process a chance to grow.

270
00:15:38,178 --> 00:15:41,380
Once the Cardassians
are invested in the process

271
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:44,359
it, it may be easier
to discuss these matters.

272
00:15:47,936 --> 00:15:50,568
Very well.

273
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,740
A wise decision, Eminence.

274
00:15:52,782 --> 00:15:55,881
I hope so, Vedek Bareil.

275
00:15:55,957 --> 00:15:58,121
The first meeting with Turrel

276
00:15:58,163 --> 00:16:01,035
is scheduled
for tomorrow afternoon.

277
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,406
I will see you before then.

278
00:16:07,921 --> 00:16:09,653
I take it you're not here

279
00:16:09,692 --> 00:16:12,096
to deliver a good report,
Doctor.

280
00:16:14,271 --> 00:16:15,866
In order to revive you...

281
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:18,141
I had to flood
your nervous system

282
00:16:18,181 --> 00:16:19,879
with neurogenic radiation.

283
00:16:19,952 --> 00:16:23,553
Unfortunately, this has caused
some kind of selective

284
00:16:23,595 --> 00:16:26,124
vasoconstriction
of your arteries.

285
00:16:26,168 --> 00:16:28,606
The result is
an inadequate blood flow

286
00:16:28,641 --> 00:16:30,201
to your internal organs.

287
00:16:30,246 --> 00:16:32,376
So what do we do?

288
00:16:32,418 --> 00:16:35,186
We'd like to place you back
into stasis...

289
00:16:35,225 --> 00:16:37,493
do some research
on your condition.

290
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:40,365
For how long?

291
00:16:40,405 --> 00:16:41,931
I don't know yet.

292
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,411
Days, weeks...

293
00:16:43,447 --> 00:16:44,939
even months.

294
00:16:45,017 --> 00:16:46,384
Maybe even years?

295
00:16:46,421 --> 00:16:47,651
Maybe.

296
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:49,821
I'm sorry, Doctor,
that's not acceptable.

297
00:16:49,863 --> 00:16:53,361
I can't allow myself
to be put in storage

298
00:16:53,406 --> 00:16:54,898
when my people need me.

299
00:16:54,943 --> 00:16:57,781
I don't want to wake
to a Bajor still haunted

300
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,947
by the memory of the occupation.

301
00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:04,592
I realize how important
these talks are to Bajor

302
00:17:04,635 --> 00:17:09,204
but, as your physician,
my duty is to you first.

303
00:17:09,247 --> 00:17:12,950
And I have a duty to Bajor.

304
00:17:13,023 --> 00:17:16,760
Please, help me heal my people.

305
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,865
It's the only thing
that matters to me.

306
00:17:23,216 --> 00:17:24,708
There is...

307
00:17:27,729 --> 00:17:31,364
an experimental drug...

308
00:17:31,405 --> 00:17:32,772
called vasokin

309
00:17:32,808 --> 00:17:35,508
which would increase
the blood flow to your organs

310
00:17:35,548 --> 00:17:37,519
and might... enable you

311
00:17:37,553 --> 00:17:40,321
to function normally
for a while.

312
00:17:40,361 --> 00:17:44,235
But there is a great
deal of risk attached.

313
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,831
What sort of risk?

314
00:17:45,876 --> 00:17:51,653
In 22 percent of cases,
vasokin has severely damaged

315
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,496
patients' lungs,
kidneys, even heart...

316
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:57,368
sometimes the brain.

317
00:17:57,405 --> 00:18:01,142
In your condition,
it could be fatal.

318
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:05,123
But it would allow me
to function normally

319
00:18:05,158 --> 00:18:06,684
for the next few days?

320
00:18:06,729 --> 00:18:08,963
Yes.

321
00:18:09,002 --> 00:18:12,067
But why risk your life
for a few days?

322
00:18:13,949 --> 00:18:17,584
I have no great desire to die,
Doctor

323
00:18:17,624 --> 00:18:22,592
but I am determined to carry out
the will of the Prophets

324
00:18:22,637 --> 00:18:24,369
as long as I am able

325
00:18:24,408 --> 00:18:27,246
and I cannot
carry out their will

326
00:18:27,283 --> 00:18:30,747
if I am unconscious
in some stasis tube.

327
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,990
Please...

328
00:18:35,337 --> 00:18:37,673
begin the vasokin treatments.

329
00:18:44,862 --> 00:18:46,992
All right.

330
00:18:47,034 --> 00:18:49,404
We'll start this afternoon.

331
00:18:51,211 --> 00:18:54,049
I only hope
we don't regret this.

332
00:18:55,891 --> 00:18:57,828
So do I.

333
00:19:06,306 --> 00:19:10,112
Station Log, Stardate 48498.4.

334
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,485
Legate Turrel
has arrived aboard the station

335
00:19:12,522 --> 00:19:14,652
to resume the negotiations.

336
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,028
Vedek Bareil suggested

337
00:19:16,065 --> 00:19:19,062
that I sit in on the talks
as an impartial observer

338
00:19:19,106 --> 00:19:21,510
and Kai Winn has agreed.

339
00:19:21,546 --> 00:19:23,676
Perhaps you didn't hear me.

340
00:19:23,718 --> 00:19:28,287
There are no Bajoran prisoners
left in Cardassian hands.

341
00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:30,767
Maybe we should redefine
our terms.

342
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:33,536
Perhaps there are
no official prisoners

343
00:19:33,577 --> 00:19:36,551
but are there a number
of, shall we say...

344
00:19:36,585 --> 00:19:37,952
detainees?

345
00:19:37,988 --> 00:19:41,452
There are of course people being
detained at the Justice Ministry

346
00:19:41,497 --> 00:19:43,331
for crimes against the state

347
00:19:43,368 --> 00:19:46,034
but that is a discussion
for another time.

348
00:19:46,076 --> 00:19:49,016
Now, I would like to discuss

349
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,714
what you've called
"war reparations."

350
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:53,785
We would be willing to pay
for the destruction

351
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:56,735
of all Bajoran property
incurred during our occupation

352
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:00,644
as long as you would be
willing to return to us

353
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,779
all Cardassian
property and equipment

354
00:20:03,822 --> 00:20:05,656
left behind on Bajor.

355
00:20:05,693 --> 00:20:08,895
What... sort of property?

356
00:20:08,935 --> 00:20:14,746
I can provide you with lists
of material, equipment...

357
00:20:14,784 --> 00:20:18,156
as long as we have
an agreement in principle

358
00:20:18,192 --> 00:20:20,756
that anything
of Cardassian origin

359
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,137
does still belong
to the Cardassian people.

360
00:20:25,478 --> 00:20:28,280
I... will consider your offer.

361
00:20:28,318 --> 00:20:29,412
Good.

362
00:20:29,455 --> 00:20:31,984
Shall we take a recess?

363
00:20:46,365 --> 00:20:48,359
He's up to something.

364
00:20:51,044 --> 00:20:53,950
That much seems clear.

365
00:20:53,985 --> 00:20:56,115
But what?

366
00:20:56,158 --> 00:21:00,032
Why is he insisting on
this principle of his?

367
00:21:00,068 --> 00:21:02,302
I need Bareil.

368
00:21:02,341 --> 00:21:07,720
He's the only one who knows
the entire negotiating record.

369
00:21:07,754 --> 00:21:10,420
Bareil has been talking
with Turrel for months.

370
00:21:10,461 --> 00:21:12,056
He understands him...

371
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:13,534
respects him...

372
00:21:13,637 --> 00:21:15,505
I think he even likes him.

373
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:18,538
I'm afraid you may have
to face the possibility

374
00:21:18,616 --> 00:21:22,080
that Bareil may not be able
to help you much longer.

375
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:27,561
I was chosen by the Prophets

376
00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:30,168
to lead our people
into a new era.

377
00:21:30,212 --> 00:21:31,442
I know that!

378
00:21:31,482 --> 00:21:34,182
But I was not meant
to be in a room

379
00:21:34,222 --> 00:21:35,555
with a Cardassian

380
00:21:35,593 --> 00:21:38,931
debating legalisms
and diplomatic nuances.

381
00:21:44,616 --> 00:21:47,488
I can't do this without Bareil.

382
00:21:47,524 --> 00:21:49,518
If he dies...

383
00:21:49,563 --> 00:21:52,628
then peace with Cardassia
dies with him.

384
00:22:02,563 --> 00:22:04,397
My father used to take me

385
00:22:04,435 --> 00:22:06,599
to the wilderness preserves
on Vulcan.

386
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:08,199
So for years

387
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:09,840
I thought that's what
their planet was like...

388
00:22:09,882 --> 00:22:11,442
animals and plants everywhere.

389
00:22:11,486 --> 00:22:14,118
I had no idea there
were people on Vulcan.

390
00:22:15,496 --> 00:22:18,937
Boy, Jake, she talks
a lot for a female.

391
00:22:18,972 --> 00:22:20,636
Excuse me!

392
00:22:20,744 --> 00:22:22,647
Riska, weren't you telling me

393
00:22:22,749 --> 00:22:25,221
your uncle runs a bar
on Osinar VI?

394
00:22:25,255 --> 00:22:28,127
You know, Nog's uncle
runs this bar.

395
00:22:28,163 --> 00:22:29,427
Is that right?

396
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:32,099
Let's not make
foolish conversation.

397
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,669
Just sit there
and look beautiful.

398
00:22:35,749 --> 00:22:37,549
Nog, what do you
think you're doing?

399
00:22:37,588 --> 00:22:39,525
I think I know
how to handle females.

400
00:22:41,531 --> 00:22:44,369
Jake, you know,
I've been thinking...

401
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:46,639
after we're done eating

402
00:22:46,677 --> 00:22:48,705
we could take the females
to the holosuites.

403
00:22:48,783 --> 00:22:52,920
I've borrowed one of my
uncle's private programs.

404
00:22:53,963 --> 00:22:56,561
"The massacre on Ferris VI."

405
00:22:56,603 --> 00:22:58,072
We could spend an hour

406
00:22:58,107 --> 00:23:01,411
pillaging and looting
the frightened townspeople.

407
00:23:01,449 --> 00:23:02,918
I don't think so.

408
00:23:02,953 --> 00:23:05,482
No one's asking you
to think, my dear.

409
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,592
Here, make yourself useful.

410
00:23:08,634 --> 00:23:10,332
Cut up my food for me.

411
00:23:10,372 --> 00:23:11,898
You must be joking.

412
00:23:23,941 --> 00:23:26,413
She's so dumb!

413
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:28,214
She's perfect!

414
00:23:28,253 --> 00:23:29,620
That's it.

415
00:23:33,432 --> 00:23:34,867
Wait.

416
00:23:34,902 --> 00:23:36,098
You're not leaving?

417
00:23:36,139 --> 00:23:37,665
I suppose you want me
to sit here

418
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,202
and cut your food for you, too?

419
00:23:39,247 --> 00:23:41,081
I never said anything
about cutting...

420
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:45,256
I hope you and your friend
enjoy your holosuite.

421
00:23:45,297 --> 00:23:47,291
Come on.

422
00:23:53,518 --> 00:23:54,487
Nog!

423
00:23:54,521 --> 00:23:55,785
Don't say another word, Jake.

424
00:23:55,824 --> 00:23:57,988
I think you've done enough
damage for one night!

425
00:23:58,029 --> 00:23:58,998
Me?!

426
00:23:59,032 --> 00:24:00,365
Yeah, you...
you were treating

427
00:24:00,402 --> 00:24:02,704
my female
as if she was an equal!

428
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:04,372
And you were behaving
like an idiot.

429
00:24:04,412 --> 00:24:06,542
This is the last time
I'll ever do a favor for you.

430
00:24:06,585 --> 00:24:08,488
From now on,
you get your own dates.

431
00:24:08,523 --> 00:24:10,995
And you can find someone else
to play dom-jot with!

432
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,260
Fine!

433
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,633
Good!

434
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:26,457
Turrel... is trying to get
a concession from you

435
00:24:26,504 --> 00:24:29,706
that I already rejected.

436
00:24:29,745 --> 00:24:31,078
Tell him...

437
00:24:31,115 --> 00:24:33,451
that the question

438
00:24:33,488 --> 00:24:35,858
of Cardassian
property on Bajor

439
00:24:35,928 --> 00:24:37,728
was already dealt with...

440
00:24:37,766 --> 00:24:40,831
in the armistice talks
four years ago.

441
00:24:40,874 --> 00:24:41,843
I...

442
00:24:41,876 --> 00:24:44,508
Don't... don't worry.

443
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:48,185
He'll... he'll still
pay the reparations.

444
00:24:48,226 --> 00:24:51,028
What about this question
of mining rights?

445
00:24:53,841 --> 00:24:55,607
His attention is wandering.

446
00:24:55,645 --> 00:24:56,807
He's in pain.

447
00:24:56,849 --> 00:24:58,649
Give him more of the drug.

448
00:24:58,687 --> 00:24:59,656
He's had enough.

449
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,159
Then you'll need to give
him something else.

450
00:25:01,193 --> 00:25:02,662
The negotiations

451
00:25:02,697 --> 00:25:07,073
resume in less than six hours
and we still have 40 pages!

452
00:25:07,109 --> 00:25:08,669
Listen to me.

453
00:25:08,713 --> 00:25:10,650
I don't care
about your negotiations

454
00:25:10,684 --> 00:25:12,587
and I don't care
about your treaty.

455
00:25:12,623 --> 00:25:14,719
All I care about
is my patient

456
00:25:14,762 --> 00:25:17,030
and at the moment, he needs more
treatment and less politics.

457
00:25:17,067 --> 00:25:18,867
Now, you can either
leave here willingly

458
00:25:18,906 --> 00:25:22,039
or I'll call Security
and have you thrown out.

459
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,880
You won't need to call them.

460
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,081
I'll do it myself.

461
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:34,177
Put yourself in the hands
of the Prophets, Bareil.

462
00:25:34,212 --> 00:25:36,240
They will not forsake you.

463
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:38,448
Yes, Eminence.

464
00:25:45,308 --> 00:25:48,146
Is there anything I can do?

465
00:25:49,318 --> 00:25:51,312
Just be here.

466
00:25:58,442 --> 00:26:00,002
I'm beginning to dislike

467
00:26:00,113 --> 00:26:02,847
seeing that look
on your face, Doctor.

468
00:26:02,887 --> 00:26:04,585
As I feared

469
00:26:04,624 --> 00:26:08,088
the vasokin has already
damaged your internal organs.

470
00:26:09,972 --> 00:26:11,305
What happens now?

471
00:26:11,342 --> 00:26:14,110
I can replace the damaged organs
with artificial implants

472
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,246
but as long
as you're taking the drug

473
00:26:16,288 --> 00:26:18,156
I can't guarantee
that the damage

474
00:26:18,193 --> 00:26:19,287
won't spread.

475
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:21,528
I think you
should reconsider

476
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,802
letting me put you in stasis.

477
00:26:23,841 --> 00:26:26,507
I'm afraid my mind's made up.

478
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,992
Just get me through
the negotiations.

479
00:26:31,027 --> 00:26:35,403
I must carry out
the will of the Prophets.

480
00:26:35,438 --> 00:26:38,844
Please...

481
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,512
whatever it takes...

482
00:26:41,553 --> 00:26:43,547
just do it.

483
00:27:04,453 --> 00:27:06,721
Are you going to call Security

484
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,258
and have me removed
from this room now, Doctor?

485
00:27:10,301 --> 00:27:13,639
It hadn't occurred
to me... yet.

486
00:27:14,646 --> 00:27:16,276
How is Bareil?

487
00:27:16,317 --> 00:27:18,619
The organ replacement
surgery went well.

488
00:27:18,657 --> 00:27:19,785
He's still unconscious

489
00:27:19,827 --> 00:27:22,129
but he should be awake
within the hour.

490
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:24,137
Oh, good.

491
00:27:24,171 --> 00:27:27,772
There are still several points
I have to discuss with him

492
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:30,150
before the next
negotiating session.

493
00:27:30,187 --> 00:27:32,181
That's why I'm here.

494
00:27:34,866 --> 00:27:36,564
When you see Bareil

495
00:27:36,603 --> 00:27:38,437
I want you to tell him
that you don't need him.

496
00:27:38,475 --> 00:27:41,847
That you can complete these
negotiations without him.

497
00:27:41,884 --> 00:27:44,186
But I do need him, Doctor.

498
00:27:44,224 --> 00:27:45,659
I realize that.

499
00:27:45,694 --> 00:27:48,634
But I want you to tell him
that you don't.

500
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:51,072
You seem to be
asking me to lie.

501
00:27:51,108 --> 00:27:55,883
I'm asking you to free Bareil
of his obligations to you.

502
00:27:55,953 --> 00:27:57,422
The only way
he'll accept that

503
00:27:57,458 --> 00:27:59,486
is if you tell him
he's no longer needed...

504
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:02,436
that you can go on without him.

505
00:28:02,471 --> 00:28:05,809
Now, if that's a lie,
then so be it.

506
00:28:05,846 --> 00:28:11,350
That doesn't sound
like a... Starfleet officer.

507
00:28:11,394 --> 00:28:13,126
I'm a doctor first.

508
00:28:13,165 --> 00:28:14,498
And right now, I'm trying

509
00:28:14,535 --> 00:28:16,871
to give my patient
his best chance to live.

510
00:28:16,908 --> 00:28:18,811
The only way to do that
is to put him in stasis.

511
00:28:18,846 --> 00:28:20,042
Bareil knows that

512
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:23,650
but his desire to complete
these negotiations is so strong

513
00:28:23,693 --> 00:28:26,393
that he's forcing me to keep him
conscious and mentally alert

514
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:27,800
even though it may kill him.

515
00:28:27,836 --> 00:28:30,434
None of us wants that
to happen, Doctor.

516
00:28:32,782 --> 00:28:34,377
But, if I'm not mistaken

517
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,260
the decision regarding
Bareil's treatment is up to him.

518
00:28:38,297 --> 00:28:39,698
Yes.

519
00:28:39,734 --> 00:28:44,405
As the patient, it is his right
to make that choice

520
00:28:44,446 --> 00:28:48,719
but I am asking you
to help me change his mind.

521
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,944
Eminence...

522
00:29:02,292 --> 00:29:03,761
you're the Kai.

523
00:29:03,797 --> 00:29:05,495
These are your negotiations.

524
00:29:05,534 --> 00:29:07,733
Let this be
your moment in history.

525
00:29:07,773 --> 00:29:09,505
Finish the talks on your own

526
00:29:09,545 --> 00:29:12,542
and you won't have to share
the credit with anyone.

527
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:17,121
You say that as though success
is guaranteed.

528
00:29:18,334 --> 00:29:20,636
Of course...

529
00:29:20,674 --> 00:29:25,483
if the talks fail, you'll need
someone to accept the blame...

530
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:27,649
a scapegoat.

531
00:29:27,692 --> 00:29:29,720
You're a coward.

532
00:29:29,764 --> 00:29:32,670
You're afraid to stand alone.

533
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:36,169
Bareil's already made
his decision, Doctor.

534
00:29:36,213 --> 00:29:38,777
I won't interfere.

535
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:42,654
And, Doctor...

536
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:50,846
I won't forget
what you've said here.

537
00:29:50,885 --> 00:29:53,255
Neither will I.

538
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,707
So, you never told me
about your double date.

539
00:30:01,746 --> 00:30:03,740
Not much to tell.

540
00:30:03,785 --> 00:30:04,811
That's not what I hear.

541
00:30:04,855 --> 00:30:06,985
Quark tells me that you
and Nog aren't speaking

542
00:30:07,027 --> 00:30:08,087
to each other.

543
00:30:08,129 --> 00:30:10,066
You should have seen
the way he acted, Dad.

544
00:30:10,102 --> 00:30:12,198
He was acting
like a spoiled brat.

545
00:30:12,241 --> 00:30:14,269
I've never been so embarrassed.

546
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:17,046
I don't think Leanne
will ever speak to me again.

547
00:30:17,087 --> 00:30:18,819
Hmm, so what did he do?

548
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,886
All kinds of stupid things.

549
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,331
Riska couldn't even
say two words

550
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:23,927
without him telling her
to be quiet.

551
00:30:23,971 --> 00:30:27,104
And he insisted that she cut up
his food for him.

552
00:30:27,146 --> 00:30:29,675
He was treating her
like she was some kind of slave.

553
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:33,559
It sounds like he's acting
like a Ferengi to me.

554
00:30:33,596 --> 00:30:34,963
You can't blame him for that.

555
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,267
Well, in that case, maybe
you were right all along.

556
00:30:37,306 --> 00:30:38,434
About what?

557
00:30:38,475 --> 00:30:40,674
You once said
that humans and Ferengis

558
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:42,514
are too different
to ever really be friends.

559
00:30:42,552 --> 00:30:47,189
I remember saying that,
and you know what?

560
00:30:47,231 --> 00:30:48,963
I was wrong.

561
00:30:49,003 --> 00:30:50,131
You and Nog proved that.

562
00:30:50,173 --> 00:30:52,041
Sure, you have
your cultural differences

563
00:30:52,078 --> 00:30:53,776
but there's a real bond
between you.

564
00:30:53,815 --> 00:30:57,221
Well, I know one thing.

565
00:30:57,257 --> 00:30:59,160
I'm never going to set him up
on a date again.

566
00:30:59,196 --> 00:31:01,896
I think the two of you
should talk this over

567
00:31:01,936 --> 00:31:04,135
before it becomes
too big a problem.

568
00:31:04,175 --> 00:31:08,380
I'm not sure Nog is going to be
willing to talk to me so soon.

569
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:13,331
Well, I guess you'll have to do
something to get his attention.

570
00:31:21,788 --> 00:31:22,779
What happened?

571
00:31:22,824 --> 00:31:23,815
I don't know.

572
00:31:23,859 --> 00:31:25,226
Two cc's morphenolog.

573
00:31:25,297 --> 00:31:26,391
It's all right.

574
00:31:26,433 --> 00:31:27,697
It's all right.
You're getting help.

575
00:31:27,737 --> 00:31:28,706
You're getting help.

576
00:31:28,739 --> 00:31:29,901
I thought I made it clear

577
00:31:29,942 --> 00:31:31,742
there were to be no visitors
for the next three hours!

578
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,044
It's not her fault, Doctor.

579
00:31:33,084 --> 00:31:34,644
Bareil called me himself.

580
00:31:34,688 --> 00:31:37,126
He said he had some ideas
on the treaty.

581
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:39,291
And you just couldn't wait
to hear them, could you?

582
00:31:40,636 --> 00:31:41,605
His left temporal lobe

583
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:43,269
is showing signs
of massive synaptic failure.

584
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,281
Well, I hope you got
all the advice

585
00:31:45,316 --> 00:31:46,478
you needed, Eminence

586
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:48,615
because the vasokin
has damaged his brain

587
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,321
and that damage is irreversible.

588
00:32:04,699 --> 00:32:06,693
Will he regain consciousness?

589
00:32:06,738 --> 00:32:08,732
Not in his present condition.

590
00:32:08,776 --> 00:32:12,718
You were able to replace
some of his internal organs

591
00:32:12,753 --> 00:32:14,621
with artificial implants.

592
00:32:14,659 --> 00:32:16,995
Could you do something similar

593
00:32:17,031 --> 00:32:19,299
with the damaged
parts of his brain?

594
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,433
It's hard to say
with any certainty.

595
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:22,739
There's still a great deal

596
00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:25,411
about the way the brain operates
we don't understand.

597
00:32:25,453 --> 00:32:27,891
One of my professors
at medical school used to say

598
00:32:27,926 --> 00:32:31,025
that the brain has a "spark of
life" that can't be replicated.

599
00:32:31,068 --> 00:32:34,133
If we begin to replace
parts of Bareil's brain

600
00:32:34,176 --> 00:32:38,279
with artificial implants,
that spark may be lost.

601
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:40,347
But you're saying,
if you don't do it

602
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:43,160
Bareil will never regain
consciousness and he'll die.

603
00:32:44,202 --> 00:32:45,364
I think we should

604
00:32:45,405 --> 00:32:48,379
consider what Bareil
would want us to do.

605
00:32:48,412 --> 00:32:49,540
Bareil wanted

606
00:32:49,582 --> 00:32:51,816
these negotiations
to be completed

607
00:32:51,855 --> 00:32:53,723
no matter what the cost.

608
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,232
With all due respect,
Your Eminence

609
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:58,602
you're hardly
an impartial observer here.

610
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:01,237
You have a personal interest
in these talks.

611
00:33:02,382 --> 00:33:06,256
There is more at stake
than one man's life.

612
00:33:06,292 --> 00:33:11,237
One man's life is all I'm
concerned with at the moment.

613
00:33:11,272 --> 00:33:13,368
I think she's right, Julian.

614
00:33:13,477 --> 00:33:18,856
I think Bareil would want
the positronic implants.

615
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:20,862
Kira, if I go through with this

616
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:23,368
the man who wakes up may not be
the man you used to know.

617
00:33:23,403 --> 00:33:27,540
I realize that... but I know
how important this is to him

618
00:33:27,581 --> 00:33:29,552
and I know he wouldn't want

619
00:33:29,586 --> 00:33:32,218
to just be put
in stasis indefinitely

620
00:33:32,259 --> 00:33:36,201
waiting for some medical
solution that may never come.

621
00:33:36,237 --> 00:33:38,401
Do the surgery, Julian.

622
00:33:38,442 --> 00:33:40,710
Let him finish what he started.

623
00:33:48,535 --> 00:33:49,561
Mr. Sisko?

624
00:33:49,604 --> 00:33:52,270
Odo, I'd like you
to do me a favor.

625
00:33:52,312 --> 00:33:53,576
Hmm?

626
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,586
I want to be arrested.

627
00:33:57,588 --> 00:33:58,614
This is outrageous!

628
00:33:58,658 --> 00:34:01,757
I didn't steal anything
from the Tholian Ambassador!

629
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:03,291
Just another innocent man

630
00:34:03,336 --> 00:34:05,672
arrested for a crime
he didn't commit.

631
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:07,110
What is he doing here?

632
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:09,448
As if you didn't know.

633
00:34:09,486 --> 00:34:11,924
Your accomplice here
has also denied involvement

634
00:34:12,026 --> 00:34:14,328
but I have an eyewitness
who saw both of you

635
00:34:14,365 --> 00:34:16,359
breaking
into the Tholian Ambassador's

636
00:34:16,404 --> 00:34:17,600
quarters last night.

637
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,306
I don't even know
what a Tholian looks like!

638
00:34:21,985 --> 00:34:23,751
Tell it to the magistrate.

639
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,131
At least put me in my own cell!

640
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:29,535
I'm sorry the quarters
aren't to your liking.

641
00:34:29,571 --> 00:34:32,977
Please feel free to submit
a complaint to the management.

642
00:34:41,702 --> 00:34:44,231
The positronic implant
is functioning normally.

643
00:34:44,276 --> 00:34:47,546
And the midbrain interface
is on line and he's awake.

644
00:34:55,037 --> 00:34:56,597
Bareil.

645
00:34:57,944 --> 00:34:59,608
Yes, Major?

646
00:34:59,649 --> 00:35:01,118
How are you feeling?

647
00:35:02,524 --> 00:35:04,016
Awake.

648
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,934
Everything is different.

649
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:11,468
Different?

650
00:35:11,513 --> 00:35:13,108
In what way?

651
00:35:14,922 --> 00:35:19,423
It's hard to explain...

652
00:35:19,468 --> 00:35:21,667
but when you touch me

653
00:35:21,706 --> 00:35:24,908
it doesn't seem real.

654
00:35:26,419 --> 00:35:30,418
It's more like
the distant memory of a touch.

655
00:35:33,537 --> 00:35:36,943
Vedek, do you remember
the negotiations?

656
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,509
I have some questions for you.

657
00:35:39,553 --> 00:35:41,787
Of course, Eminence.

658
00:35:41,825 --> 00:35:44,093
I will do all that I can.

659
00:35:58,134 --> 00:36:00,002
Something's wrong.

660
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,066
No kidding.

661
00:36:01,108 --> 00:36:02,942
That's not what I mean.

662
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:06,386
My father told me that if I
got caught stealing again

663
00:36:06,423 --> 00:36:07,790
he would send me back

664
00:36:07,826 --> 00:36:11,267
to live on the Ferengi homeworld
with my grandmother.

665
00:36:13,207 --> 00:36:14,608
So where is he?

666
00:36:14,644 --> 00:36:18,985
I mean, why isn't he here
yelling and threatening me?

667
00:36:20,192 --> 00:36:23,030
And where's Uncle Quark?

668
00:36:23,065 --> 00:36:25,299
Now, I'm late for work.

669
00:36:28,213 --> 00:36:32,155
And come to think of it,
what are you doing here?

670
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:33,691
Ask Odo.

671
00:36:33,726 --> 00:36:36,096
No, no, no,
throwing you in here

672
00:36:36,133 --> 00:36:37,534
wasn't Odo's idea.

673
00:36:38,673 --> 00:36:42,672
You don't just arrest
the Station Commander's son

674
00:36:42,717 --> 00:36:45,623
without some
really strong evidence.

675
00:36:45,657 --> 00:36:48,152
And I know there
is no evidence

676
00:36:48,197 --> 00:36:51,137
because I know
we didn't do anything.

677
00:36:51,172 --> 00:36:53,440
So why are we in here, Jake?

678
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:54,913
All right,
I put Odo up to this

679
00:36:54,948 --> 00:36:56,474
because I wanted
to talk to you.

680
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:57,749
In here?

681
00:36:57,789 --> 00:36:59,988
I didn't think you'd
listen to me otherwise.

682
00:37:00,028 --> 00:37:01,760
Well, this better be good.

683
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:05,707
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

684
00:37:05,744 --> 00:37:07,715
I guess I just forgot
you were a Ferengi.

685
00:37:07,749 --> 00:37:09,184
You forgot?

686
00:37:09,219 --> 00:37:12,021
To most people, the lobes
are a dead giveaway.

687
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,794
What I mean is,
we spend so much time together

688
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,997
and we seem so much alike

689
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:20,070
I, I sometimes forget
we're different.

690
00:37:21,851 --> 00:37:23,685
I know we're different.

691
00:37:23,723 --> 00:37:26,561
I mean, anyone
who talks to a female

692
00:37:26,597 --> 00:37:30,471
with fawning respect
is no Ferengi.

693
00:37:30,507 --> 00:37:33,105
It made me sick.

694
00:37:33,147 --> 00:37:34,947
You want to talk about sick?

695
00:37:34,985 --> 00:37:38,050
Sick is making Riska
cut up your food for you.

696
00:37:38,093 --> 00:37:40,725
Well, at least I didn't
have her chew it.

697
00:37:40,767 --> 00:37:41,793
Chew it!

698
00:37:41,837 --> 00:37:42,863
That's right.

699
00:37:42,906 --> 00:37:46,780
In traditional Ferengi homes

700
00:37:46,816 --> 00:37:49,186
the females soften the food
with their teeth

701
00:37:49,223 --> 00:37:51,787
before they give it
to the males.

702
00:37:51,829 --> 00:37:53,093
That is disgusting.

703
00:37:53,132 --> 00:37:55,035
I knew you would react that way

704
00:37:55,071 --> 00:37:56,974
which is why I did
not have her do it.

705
00:37:57,009 --> 00:37:58,308
Well, do you have

706
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,975
any other disgusting
Ferengi customs

707
00:38:00,017 --> 00:38:00,986
I should know about?

708
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,421
Plenty.

709
00:38:02,457 --> 00:38:05,829
And I know plenty of human
customs which disgust me.

710
00:38:07,136 --> 00:38:10,201
Great, so we both
disgust each other.

711
00:38:10,244 --> 00:38:11,577
You know, as we get older

712
00:38:11,614 --> 00:38:13,278
this is just going
to get worse.

713
00:38:13,386 --> 00:38:16,188
But I know one thing

714
00:38:16,226 --> 00:38:18,026
I don't want to lose you
as a friend.

715
00:38:19,835 --> 00:38:20,895
Well, in that case

716
00:38:20,939 --> 00:38:23,537
double-dating is definitely out.

717
00:38:23,578 --> 00:38:24,547
Agreed.

718
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,312
And I guess
we'll just have to deal

719
00:38:26,385 --> 00:38:28,322
with the rest
of our disgusting habits

720
00:38:28,357 --> 00:38:29,326
as they come up.

721
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,024
I guess so.

722
00:38:33,203 --> 00:38:34,172
You feel better?

723
00:38:34,206 --> 00:38:35,175
Yeah.

724
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:36,234
Good.

725
00:38:38,784 --> 00:38:40,185
Now can we get out of here?

726
00:38:40,221 --> 00:38:41,212
Sure.

727
00:38:44,065 --> 00:38:45,125
Odo?

728
00:38:46,204 --> 00:38:47,366
Odo.

729
00:38:47,407 --> 00:38:50,404
He-He's just playing around.

730
00:38:52,353 --> 00:38:53,707
- Odo?
- Odo!

731
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,404
Station Log, supplemental.

732
00:38:56,447 --> 00:38:57,848
Kai Winn has announced

733
00:38:57,885 --> 00:39:00,084
that Legate Turrel has signed
the peace treaty.

734
00:39:00,123 --> 00:39:03,621
The news has sent a shock wave
throughout the quadrant.

735
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:05,569
And although there is
still some opposition

736
00:39:05,604 --> 00:39:09,171
from hard-line elements
on both Bajor and Cardassia

737
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:11,310
it looks as though
they are finally willing

738
00:39:11,352 --> 00:39:13,916
to put their long conflict
behind them.

739
00:39:20,843 --> 00:39:23,407
Remind me not to invite
you to my next party.

740
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:25,786
I'm sorry.

741
00:39:25,823 --> 00:39:28,661
I guess I'm sort of casting
a pall over this gathering.

742
00:39:28,698 --> 00:39:32,299
Julian, no one's expecting you
to provide entertainment

743
00:39:32,341 --> 00:39:34,141
but you should try
to enjoy yourself.

744
00:39:34,179 --> 00:39:36,309
After all, the celebration
is for you, too.

745
00:39:36,351 --> 00:39:39,918
Well, frankly, I can't imagine

746
00:39:39,994 --> 00:39:42,900
what I've done...
deserves a celebration.

747
00:39:42,935 --> 00:39:46,034
You kept him alive
against incredible odds.

748
00:39:46,076 --> 00:39:48,378
No matter what happens

749
00:39:48,415 --> 00:39:50,683
you should always
be proud of that.

750
00:39:57,706 --> 00:39:59,677
Excuse me.

751
00:39:59,711 --> 00:40:00,680
Your Eminence.

752
00:40:00,714 --> 00:40:01,944
Yes?

753
00:40:01,984 --> 00:40:07,659
Kai Winn, allow me
to introduce "Kai Winn."

754
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:09,636
I don't understand.

755
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,436
In honor of the occasion

756
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:14,209
I've named my latest creation
after you.

757
00:40:14,249 --> 00:40:19,890
It's a chocolate soufflé with...

758
00:40:19,931 --> 00:40:23,030
Haligian tongue sauce.

759
00:40:23,072 --> 00:40:25,772
Well, I'm very honored.

760
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,649
Mmm... mmm.

761
00:40:30,692 --> 00:40:32,629
And you're also very popular.

762
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:36,104
Believe me, I can't keep up
with the orders so far!

763
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,680
Medical emergency.

764
00:40:40,718 --> 00:40:43,282
Dr. Bashir to the Infirmary.

765
00:40:45,296 --> 00:40:47,358
Please excuse me.

766
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,576
It's the other half
of his brain, isn't it?

767
00:40:51,612 --> 00:40:53,344
But you can still help him,
can't you?

768
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:55,378
You can replace
the other half of his brain

769
00:40:55,422 --> 00:40:57,120
with a positronic matrix.

770
00:40:57,194 --> 00:41:01,604
I'm sorry, Nerys,
but this is where it ends.

771
00:41:01,638 --> 00:41:03,073
What do you mean?

772
00:41:03,143 --> 00:41:04,669
I won't remove whatever

773
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:07,447
last shred of humanity
Bareil has left.

774
00:41:07,487 --> 00:41:09,857
But you can do it.

775
00:41:09,894 --> 00:41:11,022
Perhaps, child

776
00:41:11,063 --> 00:41:13,935
it is time to listen
to Dr. Bashir.

777
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:18,574
Sure. You got your peace treaty,
your place in history.

778
00:41:18,616 --> 00:41:21,111
You don't need Bareil anymore.

779
00:41:21,223 --> 00:41:24,595
Believe me, child,
I share your pain

780
00:41:24,632 --> 00:41:28,973
but I think the Prophets
are calling to Bareil.

781
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:33,420
I will see to it that
Bajor never forgets him.

782
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,956
Doctor.

783
00:41:47,357 --> 00:41:51,424
Julian... you can't give up now.

784
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:53,906
You have to keep going.

785
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:57,941
Nerys...

786
00:41:57,985 --> 00:42:01,426
if I remove
the rest of his brain

787
00:42:01,461 --> 00:42:04,594
and replace it with a machine

788
00:42:04,635 --> 00:42:10,173
he may look like Bareil,
he may even talk like Bareil

789
00:42:10,283 --> 00:42:12,778
but he won't be Bareil.

790
00:42:12,823 --> 00:42:15,125
That "spark of life"
will be gone.

791
00:42:15,163 --> 00:42:17,100
He'll be dead.

792
00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:20,132
And I'll be the one
who killed him.

793
00:42:20,176 --> 00:42:24,118
But if we do nothing, he'll die.

794
00:42:24,153 --> 00:42:27,184
That's right, he will.

795
00:42:27,227 --> 00:42:32,104
But he'll die like a man,
not a machine.

796
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:35,046
Please...

797
00:42:35,082 --> 00:42:38,454
don't make me
fight you on this one.

798
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:41,054
Just let him go.

799
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,841
How much time?

800
00:42:47,881 --> 00:42:53,351
All brain activity should cease
within the next three hours.

801
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:58,469
I'd like to stay
with him till then.

802
00:42:59,512 --> 00:43:00,845
Of course.

803
00:43:12,444 --> 00:43:15,316
You got your peace treaty.

804
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:19,792
I just wish
that we'd had more time for us.

805
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:24,069
There's so much
I never told you, but...

806
00:43:26,047 --> 00:43:31,653
this is the time we have left,
so I'd better say it now.

807
00:43:46,967 --> 00:43:52,778
I'll... I'll never forget
the first time I saw you

808
00:43:52,816 --> 00:43:56,656
the day you came to the station.

809
00:43:56,693 --> 00:44:00,966
You had...
such a serenity about you.

810
00:44:01,004 --> 00:44:04,946
I thought you had
all the answers.

811
00:44:04,981 --> 00:44:09,618
It really got on my nerves
for a while.

812
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,824
Then I got to know you

813
00:44:11,865 --> 00:44:18,246
and I... realized you were just
as confused as the rest of us.

814
00:44:18,282 --> 00:44:22,385
You just accepted your confusion

815
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,057
better than anyone
I've ever known.

816
00:44:27,038 --> 00:44:30,103
That's when I realized
I loved you.
