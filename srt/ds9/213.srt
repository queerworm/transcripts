00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,712
BASHIR:<i> Chief Medical</i>
<i>Officer's Log,</i>

2
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:05,547
<i>supplemental.</i>

3
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,758
<i>Chief O'Brien and I are</i>
<i>on board a T'Lani cruiser</i>

4
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:09,551
<i>helping the T'Lani</i>
<i>and the Kelleruns</i>

5
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:12,011
<i>eliminate their stockpiles</i>
<i>of harvesters--</i>

6
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:14,723
<i>deadly biomechanical</i>
<i>gene disrupters</i>

7
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:18,853
<i>used by both sides</i>
<i>in their centuries-long war.</i>

8
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:21,814
Dr. Nydrom, how's
our muon charge?

9
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:23,524
Coming up
to full power.

10
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,738
Go ahead.

11
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:37,913
Computer...

12
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:40,123
this is harvester
test sequence

13
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,750
number 375.

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,585
Muon generator
now at full power.

15
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,379
Once more unto
the breach.

16
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,006
I hope this works

17
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:49,424
because, quite frankly,
I'm running out of ideas.

18
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,593
It took ten years to
<i>perfect</i> the harvesters.

19
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,637
We've only been trying to
eliminate them for a week.

20
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:55,263
Is that all it's been?

21
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,933
It feels like we've been
working for more than a month.

22
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,810
I've never seen
a nano-biogenic weapon

23
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,145
so resistant
to broad-spectrum radiation.

24
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:05,273
It's just a matter
of finding the right combination

25
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,525
of muon frequencies.

26
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:08,276
It should be simple,
but it's not.

27
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,111
O'BRIEN:
Doctor?

28
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,364
Start the sequence,
or we<i> will</i> be here for a month.

29
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:14,616
Right, Chief.

30
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:21,248
I'm introducing the harvester
into the genetic bath.

31
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,500
Beginning muon influx now.

32
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:42,477
Doctor, please check
for any gene-disrupter phasing.

33
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:50,027
The genetic integrity
of the sample is holding steady.

34
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,988
I'm not reading
any genetic disruption at all.

35
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,615
Are you sure?

36
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,283
Check the sequence
again.

37
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,412
The results are identical.

38
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:01,997
O'BRIEN:
What?

39
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,085
It worked, didn't it?

40
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:07,962
Would somebody

41
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:09,421
say something?

42
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:14,175
It worked, all right.

43
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,762
The harvesters
have been destroyed.

44
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,388
(<i> murmuring voices</i> )

45
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,683
Good news, I take it.

46
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,060
Ambassador Sharat,
I am pleased

47
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,812
to inform you
that we have found a way

48
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,271
to eliminate
the harvesters.

49
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,023
Excellent.

50
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,441
Well done.

51
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:32,402
I knew if our people
stopped killing each other

52
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,862
and worked together

53
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:38,283
we could put an end
to these horrible weapons.

54
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,201
This is a symbol

55
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,870
of the new future
we have embarked upon.

56
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,580
Yes, and let's
not forget

57
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,958
we couldn't
have done it

58
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,042
without the help
of our friends

59
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,460
from the Federation.

60
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,296
At first, we questioned
Dr. Nydrom's decision

61
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,965
to bring in outside help.

62
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:55,300
Obviously, it was
the right thing to do.

63
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,053
We're all very grateful
for your assistance.

64
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,763
It was our pleasure,
we assure you.

65
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,598
SHARAT:
But eliminating
the harvesters

66
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,017
is only half the task.

67
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:05,144
We must make certain
all scientific data

68
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:07,312
concerned with them
is wiped out, as well.

69
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,605
I've purged every file

70
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,691
in the T'Lani
and Kellerun data banks

71
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,191
pertaining
to the harvesters.

72
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,861
If anyone gets it
in their head

73
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,445
to build these things again,

74
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,156
they'll have to start
from scratch.

75
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:18,323
Then it's finished.

76
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,407
Not quite.

77
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,451
We shouldn't rest

78
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:27,624
until the entire Kellerun
and T'Lani supply of harvesters

79
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,793
has been destroyed.

80
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,962
We will begin
immediately.

81
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,849
KIRA:
Commander

82
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,018
I have Dr. Bashir
for you on subspace.

83
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,477
In here.

84
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,687
BASHIR:
Commander

85
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,522
we have some good news
to report.

86
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,898
I've already heard.

87
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,192
You have?

88
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,027
Yes, I received a message
from both

89
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,945
the T'Lani and Kellerun
Ambassadors, informing me

90
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,822
of your success
in neutralizing the harvesters.

91
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,449
Congratulations, gentlemen.

92
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,534
Thank you, sir

93
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,077
but the Doctor
here deserves

94
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,120
the bulk of the credit.

95
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,496
Actually, it was
a team effort.

96
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,372
The Doctor's just
being modest, sir.

97
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:16,043
He was the one who
came up with muon rays

98
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,544
as a possible solution.

99
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,462
Luckily, it worked.

100
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,797
When can we expect you back?

101
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,007
Soon, I hope.

102
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,550
The Ambassador said something

103
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,510
about a celebration
on T'Lani Prime.

104
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,304
BASHIR:
Yes, it's set for tonight

105
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,181
but the Chief
is quite anxious

106
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,016
to return back
to the station.

107
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,600
It's been
a long week.

108
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,269
Still...

109
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:37,105
I think we can spare you
for another day.

110
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,192
I agree... if that's okay
with you, Chief.

111
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:42,944
I suppose another
day won't kill me.

112
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:43,987
That's the spirit.

113
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,697
Then we'll expect you back

114
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:46,865
day after tomorrow.

115
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,033
BASHIR:
Yes, sir.

116
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,284
Enjoy yourselves, gentlemen.

117
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,245
You've earned it.

118
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,342
The last cylinder.

119
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,261
I believe that
you should have

120
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,804
the honor, Doctor.

121
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,847
My pleasure.

122
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,391
It's ironic, isn't it

123
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:15,727
that the war should finally
come to an end up here

124
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,271
above T'Lani III?

125
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,273
A planet whose entire population

126
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:22,025
was decimated
by harvesters.

127
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:25,820
I hope this will be
a lasting peace.

128
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,409
What is this?

129
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,911
Weapons aren't allowed up here.

130
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,297
They're all dead.

131
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:26,340
We will be, too

132
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,175
if we don't
get out of here.

133
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,802
O'Brien to<i> Ganges.</i>

134
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:34,055
Computer, activate remote
transporter sequence.

135
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,475
O'Brien to<i> Ganges!</i>

136
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,018
They must be jamming
communications

137
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,060
with the runabout.

138
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,561
(<i> shots firing</i> )

139
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,563
We sure as hell
can't stay here.

140
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,899
We'll have to beam down
to the surface.

141
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,360
But they'll be able
to follow us.

142
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,944
I'm programming the system
to overload

143
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,364
30 seconds
after we transport.

144
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,408
Let's go.

145
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,626
SISKO:
I'll have a cup
of Alterian chowder,

146
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,337
uttaberry crepes...

147
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:06,838
Ah, and a slice of...

148
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,173
KIRA:
Kira to Sisko.

149
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,632
Go ahead, Major.

150
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,468
The T'Lani
and Kellerun Ambassadors

151
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,178
have just arrived
on the station.

152
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,595
They're asking to see you.

153
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,597
Are O'Brien
and Dr. Bashir with them?

154
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,683
No, Commander,
and the Ambassadors refuse

155
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,185
to speak to anyone but you.

156
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,479
Show them to my office.
I'll be right there.

157
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,980
Yes, sir.

158
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,440
I'll have to cancel that order.

159
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,907
Are you saying both of
my officers are dead?

160
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,326
Along with some
of our greatest scientists.

161
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,618
SHARAT:
We're sorry

162
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,662
you had to share in
our misfortune.

163
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,248
What happened?

164
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,542
It was...

165
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:46,545
It was a terrible accident.

166
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,671
It appears one
of your officers--

167
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,798
a Chief O'Brien,
I believe--

168
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,552
inadvertently tripped
a security device.

169
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,387
A lethal pulse
of radiation

170
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,680
flooded the room
killing everyone.

171
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,559
Ambassador Sharat
transported off the ship

172
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,103
just minutes before
the accident occurred.

173
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,229
This security device?

174
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,022
It was built

175
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,899
into the lab's computers
decades ago.

176
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,359
We didn't even know it existed.

177
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,944
If there were no survivors

178
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,947
how do you know that Chief
O'Brien caused the accident?

179
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,615
SHARAT:
I was able to return
to the ship

180
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,367
almost immediately
after the accident.

181
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,743
The first thing I did

182
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,870
was to check
the internal security sensors.

183
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,956
They recorded
the entire incident.

184
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,916
We assumed...

185
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,961
you'd want to see
for yourself.

186
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,715
Thank you.

187
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,386
WOMAN:
Commander, I...

188
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,845
I just want you to know

189
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,973
we don't blame Chief O'Brien
for what happened.

190
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,849
On the contrary.

191
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,394
Both he and Dr. Bashir
will always be considered heroes

192
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,979
to both the Kellerun
and the T'Lani.

193
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,606
Without their help

194
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:50,108
we never could have
destroyed the harvesters.

195
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:53,236
Please extend our sympathies
to their families.

196
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,614
I'll do that.

197
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,585
(<i> whispering</i> ):
Chief. Chief.

198
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,753
In here.

199
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,589
Wait!

200
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,591
Don't touch anything.
But why not?

201
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:57,967
There's food
and medical supplies.

202
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,718
Yeah, they could
be booby-trapped.

203
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:02,138
The Cardassians used
to rig the supplies

204
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,475
they left behind with
pressure grenades.

205
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:06,809
I've seen more
than one soldier

206
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,145
permanently lose
his appetite that way.

207
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,606
Well, did you find anything?

208
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,400
Looks all right.

209
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,693
Good.

210
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,864
At least we won't starve.

211
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,117
Here.

212
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,494
No.

213
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,744
Why not, Chief?

214
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:26,913
I thought you loved
military rations.

215
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,665
Yeah, Federation rations.

216
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,958
I've had enough T'Lani food
this past week

217
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,293
to last me a lifetime.

218
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,093
Well, we've got
to keep our strength up.

219
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,678
We're going to have to find
some way

220
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,722
of warning the T'Lani
that the Kelleruns

221
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:44,847
have broken
the treaty.

222
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,140
I still can't figure it.

223
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,392
Why would the Kelleruns wait

224
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,310
till the harvesters
were destroyed

225
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,478
before they made their move?

226
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,523
Maybe they didn't hand over

227
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:54,733
all the harvesters
for destruction.

228
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,359
Maybe they're convinced

229
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,570
they can defeat the T'Lani
with conventional weapons.

230
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,113
I suppose,
but that might mean

231
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,365
continuing the war
for another hundred years.

232
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,076
Well, whatever the reason,
we'd better keep moving.

233
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,620
Wait! Listen to me, Julian.

234
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,787
The Kelleruns are
going to expect us

235
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,415
to be on the move.

236
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,417
We start running, their
sensors will pick us up

237
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,792
before we've
gone a kilometer.

238
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,754
If we stay still
maybe, just<i> maybe</i>

239
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:18,172
it'll take them longer
to find us.

240
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,966
The way I see it, we
have only one chance

241
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,051
to survive this thing,

242
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,428
and that's to stay alive

243
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,054
long enough for
Commander Sisko to find us.

244
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,265
But that won't be
for at least another day.

245
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,976
He still thinks we're
celebrating on T'Lani Prime.

246
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,562
I said it was our only chance.

247
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,232
I didn't say it was a good one.

248
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,159
What have we here?

249
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:51,331
Looks like some
kind of com system.

250
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,626
Maybe we can contact
the T'Lani from here.

251
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:57,003
Do you think
you can get it working?

252
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,255
Well, I'll have
to open it up--

253
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,924
see if there's a
backup power supply.

254
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:10,433
Why don't you take
a seat, Doctor?

255
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,186
Well, I thought
maybe I could help.

256
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,730
I took the engineering
extension courses

257
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,231
at Starfleet Medical.

258
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,650
Extension courses?

259
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,777
They were actually
quite informative.

260
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:21,902
Julian?

261
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,070
Hmm?

262
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,656
Do you really
want to help me?

263
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:25,615
Yes.

264
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,367
Then let me do my job.

265
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,453
Of course.

266
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,707
I'll, uh, I'll inventory
the supplies, then.

267
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:36,710
Fine. Why don't
you do that?

268
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,467
NYDROM:
The last cylinder.

269
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:45,719
I believe that
you should have

270
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,595
the honor, Doctor.

271
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,472
BASHIR:
My pleasure.

272
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:08,074
NYDROM:
The harvesters
have been destroyed.

273
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,325
Congratulations.

274
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,160
Thank you.

275
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,037
We must make certain
that all records

276
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,748
of their existence
are wiped out.

277
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,374
O'BRIEN:
I've purged
every file

278
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:17,792
in the T'Lani
and Kellerun
data banks

279
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,669
pertaining to
the harvesters.

280
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,504
If anyone gets
it in their head

281
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:22,881
to build these
things again

282
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,090
they'll have to
start from scratch.

283
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,467
NYDROM:
Then it's
finished.

284
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,139
Hold on.
What's this?

285
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,182
Chief?

286
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,809
I don't know.

287
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,186
Closing the last file
seems to have activated

288
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,730
some kind of
security program.

289
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,064
It looks like
it was part

290
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,274
of the original
operating system.

291
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,525
I can't shut it down.

292
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,026
Do you know
anything about this?

293
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,528
NYDROM:
No.

294
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,822
Maybe you should try
cutting the power.

295
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,533
It's not
responding.

296
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,498
I've heard of security
weapons like this--

297
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,418
a radiation pulse that
vaporizes any intruder

298
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,837
who doesn't enter
the proper code.

299
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,589
I'm surprised the Chief
didn't detect it.

300
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,467
It must have been buried
very deep in the system.

301
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,718
I'd like to talk

302
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,596
to the Chief of Security
for that ship.

303
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,514
So would I.

304
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,433
Remember, they lost people, too.

305
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,101
But the T'Lani
were responsible

306
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,519
for O'Brien and
Bashir's safety.

307
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,020
They should have known
about that device

308
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,147
and deactivated it.

309
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,649
That will do, Major.

310
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:27,528
I'd like for you to contact
Bajoran medical officials.

311
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,238
We'll need a doctor

312
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,698
to be temporarily assigned
to the station

313
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,992
until Starfleet can send us
a replacement

314
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:33,993
for Dr. Bashir.

315
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,703
Dax,

316
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,205
inform Starfleet
of the accident.

317
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,375
Tell them we'll need
a new Medical Officer

318
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,086
and a new Chief of Operations.

319
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:49,008
Would you like me to go
with you to see Mrs. O'Brien?

320
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:53,012
No, I'll take care of it.

321
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,599
Find out how I can contact
Julian's family.

322
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:02,730
Major, inform the crew we'll
be holding a memorial service

323
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,858
tomorrow evening at 1800 hours.

324
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,276
Yes, sir.

325
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,946
All right, people

326
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,782
I know the next few days
are going to be hard

327
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,535
but we all have jobs to do.

328
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,538
Dismissed.

329
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,922
(<i> sighing</i> )

330
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,806
So, having any luck?

331
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:39,475
I wish you'd stop
asking me that.

332
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,894
I'm sorry.

333
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,229
It's just all this
standing around.

334
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,024
At least you're doing
something constructive.

335
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,859
You just keep
your eyes open

336
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:49,569
for any
Kellerun soldiers.

337
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:52,655
Don't worry, I will.

338
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,411
It's such a mess in here.

339
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,162
You'll make
it work, Chief.

340
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,498
This is the kind
of challenge
you live for.

341
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,917
You know, I was
looking forward

342
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,878
to the celebrations
on T'Lani Prime.

343
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:09,005
I don't know
if you've noticed

344
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,340
but T'Lani women
are quite attractive.

345
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,593
I'm not blind, you know.

346
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:14,844
Of course not.

347
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,220
But you are married.

348
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,180
Just 'cause you're married

349
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,307
doesn't mean you stop
looking at women.

350
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,518
Just as long as you don't
let your wife<i> see</i> you look.

351
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,105
For me, tonight's
celebrations

352
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,066
would have been
an adventure.

353
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,192
The most you could
have hoped for

354
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,485
was a good meal.

355
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,238
Women--
that's all you think about.

356
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,198
No, it isn't.

357
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,077
Although I do think
about them a lot.

358
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:43,957
Yeah, well, one of these days
you'll fall in love with one.

359
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,208
I did once.

360
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,419
Not work out?

361
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,505
Not quite.

362
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,424
Close.

363
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,885
Oh, I don't know.

364
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:59,973
Somehow, marriage
just doesn't seem fair.

365
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:01,515
Fair?

366
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,225
Fair... to them.

367
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,477
I mean, look at us.

368
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,604
Our lives are constantly
in danger.

369
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,815
There's enough to worry about

370
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,776
without worrying about
the wife and kids at home

371
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:12,902
worrying about us.

372
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,532
I'm sorry, Chief.

373
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,494
I just feel that way.

374
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,288
A lot of career officers
feel that way.

375
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:28,960
Well, you career officers
don't know what you're missing.

376
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,253
Really?

377
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,841
That may be so.

378
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:38,678
I just look at you
and Mrs. O'Brien, and I...

379
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,807
What about me and Mrs. O'Brien?

380
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:45,768
Nothing.

381
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,561
What?

382
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,605
Nothing, absolutely nothing.

383
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:59,281
It's no secret that your
assignment to this station

384
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,242
hasn't been conducive
to your marriage.

385
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,453
Say that again?

386
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:08,541
Why don't we just forget it?

387
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,544
That's the first
intelligent thing you've said

388
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,046
since we got here.

389
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,315
Are you cold?

390
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,775
Yes, aren't you?

391
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,987
No. Actually, it's
quite warm in here.

392
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:40,698
You're looking
a little pale.

393
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,158
I'm fine.

394
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,078
Your blood
pressure's low

395
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,787
and you're
running a fever.

396
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,122
You better sit down.

397
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,623
I don't want to sit down.

398
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,042
I've got work to do.

399
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,210
Roll up your sleeve.

400
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,211
Why?

401
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:54,461
Do it.

402
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,671
Please.

403
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,929
You were behind
the genetic bath

404
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,598
when it shattered,
weren't you?

405
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,434
You have something
to tell me, Doctor?

406
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:11,062
You've been infected
by the harvesters.

407
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,291
(<i> door chimes</i> )

408
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,334
Come in.

409
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,839
Commander Sisko.

410
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,516
Keiko.

411
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,854
Something's happened to Miles.

412
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,856
There was an accident.

413
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,484
Both your husband
and Dr. Bashir

414
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,694
were involved.

415
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,404
They're dead.

416
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,407
I'm sorry.

417
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:10,204
Tell me what happened.

418
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,372
The T'Lani
security sensors

419
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,583
recorded the
entire incident.

420
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,509
I want to see it.

421
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,219
I'll have it
sent to you.

422
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,890
Miles was
a fine officer

423
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,725
and a fine man.

424
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,269
I'll miss him.

425
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,730
Thank you, Commander.

426
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,943
I would like to be alone now.

427
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:44,030
If there's
anything you need

428
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,115
just let me know.

429
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,257
Chief?

430
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:04,758
It's my eyes.

431
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,220
They're...
getting fuzzy.

432
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,387
You better sit down.
I'll take over from here.

433
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:11,389
What makes you think
you can fix this?

434
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:13,351
Because you're going
to talk me through it.

435
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:15,102
Now take a seat.

436
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,481
Maybe...

437
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,444
just for a minute...

438
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,533
or two.

439
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,204
Now, tell me
where you left off.

440
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:37,541
You see the dark blue coil
in the upper right-hand corner?

441
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,501
No.

442
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,045
It's there...

443
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:42,796
beside the...

444
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,007
the green cylinder.

445
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,218
Just... just below it.

446
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:49,929
Yeah, I see it.

447
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,056
You have to...

448
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:57,603
you have to lock
the base of the coil

449
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:02,024
into the tiny receptor...
just below it.

450
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,989
You know, I
just remembered

451
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:12,410
I still have Julian's
medical school diaries.

452
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,328
He let you read them?

453
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:18,040
He felt they would help me
understand him better.

454
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,710
How? By reading about
all the women he went out with?

455
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,712
That's not what they were about.

456
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,547
When he gave them to me

457
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:29,135
he told me that they were about
his innermost thoughts...

458
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:33,180
his struggle to graduate
top of his class,

459
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,809
his dream of having a career
in Starfleet.

460
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:40,396
His constant fear of failure.

461
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,607
Really.

462
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,859
And did you?

463
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,153
Understand him better?

464
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:52,532
I never got around
to reading them.

465
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:58,080
I suppose I should send them
to his parents.

466
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,749
You could keep them.

467
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,252
Really?

468
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:05,796
I think he'd like that.

469
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,798
He cared a great deal
about you.

470
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:11,760
I know.

471
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,846
I cared about him, too.

472
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:23,814
These, um... are
on the house.

473
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:25,983
How come?

474
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:27,734
I thought we'd have a toast

475
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:30,821
to the memory of Chief
O'Brien and Dr. Bashir.

476
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:33,366
That's very thoughtful, Quark.

477
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,329
I can<i> be</i> thoughtful.

478
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:44,960
To our dear,
departed comrades.

479
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,215
We may have had our differences,
but I'll say this for them--

480
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:52,634
and it's the highest
tribute I can think of--

481
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,594
they were good customers.

482
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:55,888
They always paid

483
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:59,058
their bar bills
on time.

484
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,267
That's it?

485
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,353
I'm not done yet.

486
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:05,939
At times like this,
I'm reminded of

487
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,859
the 57th Rule
of Acquisition:

488
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:12,321
"Good customers are
as rare as latinum."

489
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,492
"Treasure them."

490
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,273
Mrs. O'Brien...

491
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:49,442
Major, I need to see
Commander Sisko.

492
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:50,692
It's very important.

493
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,403
I'll tell him
you're here.

494
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:55,155
I just wanted you to know
how sorry I am--

495
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,782
how sorry
we all are.

496
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,367
Thank you.

497
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,162
O'BRIEN:
If anyone gets
it in their head

498
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,914
to build these
things again...

499
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:06,250
KEIKO:
Watch. It's coming up
in just a few seconds.

500
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,752
NYDROM:
Then it's finished.

501
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,837
Computer,
freeze image.

502
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,381
There. Do you see it?

503
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,049
I see the Chief
drinking coffee.

504
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:17,219
Exactly. Now look
at the time index.

505
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:18,345
KIRA:
1500 hours.

506
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,513
That's right.

507
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:20,638
Late afternoon.

508
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:22,558
Miles never
drinks coffee

509
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:23,892
late in the
afternoon.

510
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,311
It keeps him up
all night.

511
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:26,812
Maybe he made an
exception this time--

512
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,646
working long hours,
under a lot of stress...

513
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:30,023
I know my husband.

514
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,359
He<i> never</i> drinks coffee
late in the day.

515
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,069
Maybe he isn't
drinking coffee.

516
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,154
Maybe it's tea.

517
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,614
I checked the
data clip.

518
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:38,865
It contained a
spectroscopic
analysis.

519
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,909
The liquid in Miles's
cup consists

520
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,036
of vegetable-based
oils and caffeine.

521
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:43,996
It's coffee, all right.

522
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,289
You're suggesting

523
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:46,915
someone tampered
with this recording?

524
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,959
Yes, I am, and I want
to know the reason why.

525
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,044
Lieutenant, when
were you planning

526
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,130
on bringing the<i> Ganges</i>
back from T'Lani III?

527
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,465
Tomorrow.

528
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:56,883
I don't see any reason
to wait, do you?

529
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,218
I'll leave
right away.

530
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,429
Good. I'll come
with you.

531
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,390
Mrs. O'Brien,

532
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,934
if this recording
has been altered,

533
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,561
we'll find out why.

534
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:20,782
BASHIR:
You were right,
Chief.

535
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:21,992
The contacts
on the sub-processor

536
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,785
are corroded.

537
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,039
Yeah.

538
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,541
They need to be cleaned.

539
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,876
Oh, um, I think
there are some sterile pads

540
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,086
in the med kit.

541
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,426
Here we go.

542
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:46,808
Don't leave me, Chief.

543
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:47,893
I still need you.

544
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,689
Don't worry.

545
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:53,357
I'm not going anywhere.

546
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,905
So, who was she?

547
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:02,700
Who?

548
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,285
"Not quite. Close."

549
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:08,830
Palis. Palis Delon.

550
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,166
She was a dancer-- a ballerina.

551
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,793
She had the most exquisite feet.

552
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:16,004
(<i> laughs</i> )
I'm serious.

553
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:20,050
It's very important for a dancer
to have good arches.

554
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,720
She was gorgeous,

555
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,346
not to mention brilliant.

556
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,432
I used to watch her onstage.

557
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:29,560
I couldn't believe how anyone
could be so graceful.

558
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,730
And she was crazy
about you, huh?

559
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:36,316
We were crazy about each other.

560
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:39,278
I used to think,
"Julian, you lucky devil.

561
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,656
You found the perfect woman."

562
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:45,534
We used to finish
each other's thoughts.

563
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,536
There.

564
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,459
What do you
think?

565
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:56,462
Good... good.

566
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,797
Put it back in the com panel.

567
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:17,065
Looks like we have
some power, anyway.

568
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,739
<i>( beeping )</i>

569
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:29,077
Still no response
from the transmitter, though.

570
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:32,122
Try re-tuning
the R-F oscillators.

571
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:36,794
So what happened

572
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:39,087
with you and Palis?

573
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,381
What happened is I graduated.

574
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,176
Her father was
the top administrator

575
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,679
at a medical complex in Paris.

576
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,347
He offered me a job.

577
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:52,351
Promised I'd be Chief of Surgery
within five years.

578
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:56,271
But you would have to give up
your Starfleet career.

579
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:59,775
I can't tell you
how close I came.

580
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:03,069
But... here I am.

581
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,781
You made your choice.

582
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:07,282
Yeah.

583
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:10,452
Sometimes, I wake up
in the middle of the night

584
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:12,329
and I think to myself...

585
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:16,208
will I ever find anyone
that wonderful again?

586
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,377
The oscillator's working

587
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,671
but the frequency's
still fluctuating.

588
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,050
Let me take a look.

589
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,093
Oh!

590
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:33,433
What is it?

591
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,812
It's... my legs.

592
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:39,022
I can't feel them.

593
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:47,155
DAX:
We're approaching
T'Lani III.

594
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,866
Establishing
a synchronous orbit

595
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:50,826
alongside the<i> Ganges.</i>

596
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,661
Open a channel
to the T'Lani cruiser.

597
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:56,832
WOMAN:
Commander Sisko,
what a pleasant surprise.

598
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,709
I take it you're here
for your runabout?

599
00:31:58,709 --> 00:31:59,918
That's correct.

600
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,336
We were about to leave

601
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,714
for the memorial service
on T'Lani Prime.

602
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:05,257
You're welcome to accompany us.

603
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,966
Perhaps we will, but first

604
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:09,636
I'd like to see for myself
where the accident took place.

605
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,639
Of course.

606
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,224
While you're
on the cruiser

607
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:15,642
I think I'll beam
over to the<i> Ganges</i>

608
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:16,685
and take a
look around.

609
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:18,771
Good idea.

610
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,070
Chief.

611
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,239
Chief, it's working.

612
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,241
Signal's very faint.

613
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:35,328
You'll have to switch to a
higher-carrier frequency.

614
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,832
Reset the actuators
on the chambers coil.

615
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,751
That's better.
It's still pretty weak, though.

616
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,168
I'm sending a distress signal.

617
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,003
It's set to repeat
every two minutes.

618
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,506
Let's hope the T'Lani find us
before the Kelleruns do.

619
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:49,217
They better get here soon.

620
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,512
Don't worry, Chief.

621
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,264
I'm going
to get you home.

622
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:57,517
In a box, maybe.

623
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,685
Nonsense.

624
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,521
Don't go giving up
on me now.

625
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,607
I'm not giving up.

626
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:04,900
I'm dying.

627
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,237
Listen to me...
listen to me, Julian.

628
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,906
(<i> labored breathing</i> )

629
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:13,742
You must tell
Keiko and Molly...

630
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,911
You tell them
yourself.

631
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:22,167
You were wrong,
you know...

632
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,752
about marriage.

633
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,754
Whatever you say, Chief.

634
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,881
Listen to me, Julian!

635
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:29,424
You're the one

636
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:33,094
who's always talking
about adventure.

637
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,847
Ha... adventure.

638
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:39,392
Marriage is the greatest
adventure of them all.

639
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:43,480
It's filled with
pitfalls and setbacks

640
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,440
and mistakes and...

641
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,694
but it's a journey
worth taking...

642
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:51,697
because you
take it together.

643
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:54,199
I know Keiko's been unhappy

644
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:57,703
about us coming
to the station.

645
00:33:57,703 --> 00:33:59,997
We still argue about it.

646
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:01,999
But that's all right

647
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:04,918
because at the
end of the day

648
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:07,671
we both know we
love each other.

649
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:09,297
Chief...

650
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,841
And that's all that matters.

651
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:11,800
Chief...

652
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,801
Huh?

653
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,344
You better
get some rest.

654
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:27,399
The T'Lani
will be here soon.

655
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:35,574
I see there's still
some residual traces

656
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:36,909
of the radiation pulse.

657
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,326
Well, that's
to be expected

658
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,286
given the pulse's
intensity

659
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,663
but it poses
no danger.

660
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,122
Tell me, Ambassador

661
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,958
have you been able to
learn anything else

662
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:48,169
about the fail-safe
device that caused
the accident?

663
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,630
Not yet, Commander,
but we're working on it.

664
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,925
It was Ambassador
Sharat that brought
you the data clip?

665
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:54,342
That's right.

666
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,719
And I suppose he
showed it to you

667
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,845
as soon as you arrived?

668
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:59,138
Of course.

669
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:02,141
Could the clip have been
altered before you saw it?

670
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:05,979
Why would Ambassador
Sharat alter

671
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:08,982
the data clip?

672
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:10,316
I have no idea.

673
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,069
DAX:
Dax to Sisko.

674
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:13,612
Sisko.

675
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:15,196
Commander,
when you're through there

676
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,823
could you join me
on the<i> Ganges?</i>

677
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:20,159
Yes, I'll be here
a few more minutes.

678
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,620
Commander, the T'Lani
and the Kellerun

679
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,747
have finally made peace.

680
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:25,331
That peace cannot survive

681
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,208
unless both sides
trust each other.

682
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:38,762
What have you got, Dax?

683
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:40,555
It looks like someone
erased five seconds

684
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,975
from the<i> Ganges'</i>
computer log.
Show me.

685
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:45,435
At first, I thought
it was just some kind
of power fluctuation.

686
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,312
but when I checked
the log's memory core

687
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:50,107
it showed traces of a
remote transport command.

688
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:51,441
Did you find any indication

689
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,192
of transport activity
at that time?

690
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,319
No.

691
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,737
And you're saying

692
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,447
somebody erased it
later on?

693
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:59,449
Look at the time index when
the call for transport came in.

694
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,451
1534-- that's a full
three minutes

695
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,870
after the accident
on the T'Lani cruiser.

696
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,665
Which means if either
Chief O'Brien or Julian

697
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,000
made that request...

698
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,208
They would have been alive

699
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,128
after the fail-safe
device went off.

700
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:12,462
Good work, Lieutenant.

701
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,092
(<i> coughing</i> )

702
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,259
Chief...

703
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,218
Chief!

704
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:21,304
Don't leave
me now.

705
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,472
Breathe.

706
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:23,765
That's better.

707
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,809
Now you're doing it.

708
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:28,103
(<i> wheezing</i> )

709
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,777
Tell me, Julian...

710
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:39,698
ever talk to that
ballerina of yours?

711
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:42,951
Not since
I left Earth.

712
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:45,662
Well, maybe...
maybe you should.

713
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,747
Well, maybe
one day I will.

714
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:51,001
(<i> footsteps nearing</i> )

715
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:07,809
BASHIR:
Ambassador
E'Tyshra.

716
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,268
Am I glad to see you.

717
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,937
Chief O'Brien was infected
by the harvesters

718
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,731
when the Kelleruns
attacked your ship.

719
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,273
They killed
all of the scientists.

720
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,193
Not all of them.

721
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:17,777
You're too late,
Sharat.

722
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,779
No, Doctor, he's
right on time.

723
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:20,780
But why kill

724
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,657
Nydrom and the others?

725
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,825
To ensure that the
peace agreement

726
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:25,326
between our two
races will last.

727
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,204
But we'd already destroyed
the harvesters.

728
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:30,207
There was no reason
for more killings, unless...

729
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:32,876
It's not enough to simply
destroy the harvesters.

730
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:35,545
We have to be sure
no one can ever recreate them.

731
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,464
The only way to do that
was to eliminate everyone

732
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:41,927
who possessed such knowledge,
including the two of you.

733
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:44,721
But we have no use
for such horrible weapons.

734
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:48,934
As long as the knowledge exists,
there's a danger it may be used.

735
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:51,061
That's a risk
we refuse to live with.

736
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:52,645
I truly am sorry, Doctor

737
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,023
but at least you
have the consolation

738
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:58,151
of knowing that your deaths
will be for a noble cause.

739
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:22,341
Wait.

740
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,302
Let him speak.

741
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,638
Help me...
help me up.

742
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:34,187
(<i> breathing heavily</i> )

743
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:35,855
I want to die
on my feet.

744
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:41,820
I'm sorry I didn't
get us home, Chief.

745
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,404
You did your best.

746
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,409
It's been an honor...
serving with you.

747
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,454
Thank you, Chief.

748
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:55,374
That means a lot.

749
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,803
Commander, am I glad
to see you!

750
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:08,638
(<i> groans</i> )

751
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:10,682
Chief O'Brien is
going to be dead
within the hour

752
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,517
if we don't get him back
to the station.

753
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,768
What happened?

754
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,603
He was exposed
to the harvesters.

755
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,563
That should stabilize him
for now.

756
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,857
They told us
you were both dead, Julian.

757
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,399
We would have been

758
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,734
if the T'Lani and Kelleruns
had had their way.

759
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,819
They're killing
everyone involved

760
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,154
with the harvesters
project.

761
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:26,323
The T'Lani cruiser's
coming this way.

762
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:29,117
They're hailing us.
Ignore them.

763
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,451
Send a general distress signal

764
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,620
on all Federation
subspace frequencies.

765
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,456
They're blocking
all subspace communication

766
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,209
with a broadband inversion.

767
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:39,294
They're hailing us again.

768
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:43,298
Is the inversion field
affecting sensors as well?

769
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,925
All short-range
sensors are useless.

770
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,635
Which means...

771
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,262
theirs are useless, too.

772
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:03,360
MAN:
Ambassador

773
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,403
Commander Sisko is
attempting to escape.

774
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,445
We are in pursuit.

775
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,114
Can we overtake them?

776
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,699
Their runabout
is no match for this ship.

777
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,743
Fire a warning shot.

778
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:15,247
Confirmed.

779
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:17,916
Commander Sisko
is hailing us.

780
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,125
I thought he would.

781
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,336
SISKO:
By firing on this vessel

782
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,421
you've committed an act of war
against the Federation.

783
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,716
Commander, we have
no quarrel with the
Federation or with you.

784
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:28,134
But we must insist

785
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,428
you turn over Dr. Bashir
and Chief O'Brien.

786
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,055
Why?
So you can murder them?

787
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,973
Unfortunately, Commander,
your officers

788
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,434
are the only two people left
who have seen the data

789
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,811
concerning the development
of the harvesters.

790
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:41,022
They have no intention
of using that information.

791
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:42,481
You have my word.

792
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,609
Their intentions are irrelevant.

793
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:48,029
The fact is, the threat remains
as long as the knowledge exists.

794
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:49,655
Commander, I know this
is painful for you.

795
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,241
It wasn't easy for us

796
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:53,492
to order the deaths
of our own people

797
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,036
but it<i> is</i> necessary.

798
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,871
And if I refuse
to turn them over?

799
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,540
You can't outrun us
and you can't fight us.

800
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,377
We can destroy your runabout
at any time.

801
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:04,754
Lieutenant Dax and I have
no knowledge of the harvesters.

802
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:06,339
Are you willing to kill us, too?

803
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:09,384
We'll do whatever we have to do
to ensure our safety.

804
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:11,094
Commander,
you are running out of options.

805
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,470
You have one minute

806
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,680
to turn over Dr. Bashir
and Chief O'Brien.

807
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,266
You want them?

808
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:18,310
You're going to have
to take us all.

809
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,396
He leaves us no choice.

810
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:22,897
The runabout
is turning.

811
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,899
It's heading back
in our direction.

812
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,401
Full stop.

813
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:29,904
He's preparing
to fire.

814
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,030
Employ shields.

815
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,074
Shields employed.

816
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,285
Put the runabout on screen.

817
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:39,289
He must know his phasers
can't hurt us.

818
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,626
He's aiming
his vessel

819
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:44,794
straight for us.

820
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:46,796
The man must be crazy.

821
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:48,756
Fire phasers.

822
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:57,890
It's over.

823
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:03,521
Head back to T'Lani III.

824
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,107
Prepare to take the
other runabout in tow.

825
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:09,819
Ambassador...

826
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:12,655
sensors indicate
the other runabout

827
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,991
is no longer
in orbit.

828
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:16,826
Well, then, where is it?

829
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:17,785
I don't know.

830
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,287
It's gone.

831
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:21,289
It can't just
have disappeared.

832
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:23,749
I'm picking up a warp signature.

833
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,835
Sisko.

834
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,507
Maybe he and the others weren't
on that runabout we destroyed.

835
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:32,758
They could have transported
to the other runabout

836
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,302
while our sensors were down.

837
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:37,389
And then piloted the first ship
by remote navigation.

838
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,683
But we saw them die.

839
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:43,728
Did we?

840
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,528
O'BRIEN:
What's this?

841
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:53,029
KEIKO:
Something Molly
made for you.

842
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,989
She painted it
herself.

843
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:58,701
Oh, it's lovely.
She has real talent.

844
00:42:58,701 --> 00:42:59,827
How's my patient?

845
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,620
Better.
Can I go home now?

846
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,956
You should be out of here
by tomorrow.

847
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,750
I just wanted to let you know

848
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,754
how much I appreciated what
you said back on T'Lani III.

849
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,548
What did I say?

850
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:13,966
That it was an honor
serving with me.

851
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:16,469
Oh... right.

852
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:17,887
And I'd like
to return

853
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,556
the compliment,
if I may.

854
00:43:19,556 --> 00:43:22,559
It's been an honor
serving with you, too, Chief.

855
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:25,937
You know, Mrs. O'Brien, they say

856
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:28,814
that when two people face death
together, it creates a bond

857
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,275
that cannot
be broken.

858
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:31,901
I never believed that
until I went...

859
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:32,944
Julian...

860
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:34,237
Hmm?

861
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:38,199
Oh.

862
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:40,410
Um, of course
you'd like to be alone.

863
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,744
I understand.

864
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,252
(<i> sighing</i> )

865
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:51,421
Miles, he saved
your life, you know.

866
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:54,090
Mmm. He's never going
to let me forget it.

867
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,341
So, what was it like

868
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,760
spending all that time
alone with him?

869
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,637
It was<i> hell.</i>

870
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,223
You can see for yourself.
The man never stops talking.

871
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:07,812
You know, I wouldn't mind
a cup of coffee right now.

872
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:10,856
Miles, you never
drink coffee in the afternoon.

873
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:12,191
Well, sure I do.

874
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,859
You do?
