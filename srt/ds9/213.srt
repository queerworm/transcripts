1
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,172
Chief Medical Officer's Log,
supplemental.

2
00:00:06,205 --> 00:00:08,870
Chief O'Brien and I are
on board a T'Lani cruiser

3
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:10,881
helping the T'Lani
and the Kelleruns

4
00:00:10,915 --> 00:00:13,045
eliminate their stockpiles
of harvesters...

5
00:00:13,087 --> 00:00:15,080
deadly biomechanical
gene disrupters

6
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:19,294
used by both sides
in their centuries-long war.

7
00:00:19,334 --> 00:00:22,204
Dr. Nydom,
how's our muon charge?

8
00:00:22,241 --> 00:00:24,108
Coming up to full power.

9
00:00:28,387 --> 00:00:30,357
Go ahead.

10
00:00:36,405 --> 00:00:38,341
Computer...

11
00:00:38,376 --> 00:00:42,249
this is harvester test sequence
number 375.

12
00:00:42,318 --> 00:00:44,151
Muon generator
now at full power.

13
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:45,920
Once more unto the breach.

14
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:47,258
I hope this works

15
00:00:47,296 --> 00:00:49,767
because, quite frankly,
I'm running out of ideas.

16
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:51,999
It took ten years
to perfect the harvesters.

17
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,567
We've only been trying
to eliminate them for a week.

18
00:00:54,611 --> 00:00:55,704
Is that all it's been?

19
00:00:55,748 --> 00:00:58,413
It feels like we've been
working for more than a month.

20
00:00:58,453 --> 00:01:00,286
I've never seen
a nano-biogenic weapon

21
00:01:00,324 --> 00:01:02,557
so resistant
to broad-spectrum radiation.

22
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:05,592
It's just a matter
of finding the right combination

23
00:01:05,636 --> 00:01:06,797
of muon frequencies.

24
00:01:06,838 --> 00:01:08,831
It should be simple,
but it's not.

25
00:01:08,877 --> 00:01:10,471
Doctor?

26
00:01:10,514 --> 00:01:12,849
Start the sequence,
or we will be here for a month.

27
00:01:12,885 --> 00:01:15,049
Right, Chief.

28
00:01:17,094 --> 00:01:21,593
I'm introducing the harvester
into the genetic bath.

29
00:01:21,638 --> 00:01:23,973
Beginning muon influx now.

30
00:01:38,274 --> 00:01:42,979
Doctor, please check
for any gene-disrupter phasing.

31
00:01:46,726 --> 00:01:50,325
The genetic integrity
of the sample is holding steady.

32
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:53,431
I'm not reading
any genetic disruption at all.

33
00:01:53,474 --> 00:01:55,137
Are you sure?

34
00:01:55,178 --> 00:01:56,841
Check the sequence again.

35
00:01:59,187 --> 00:02:00,952
The results are identical.

36
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:02,551
What?

37
00:02:04,465 --> 00:02:06,435
It worked, didn't it?

38
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,910
Would somebody say something?

39
00:02:11,313 --> 00:02:14,616
It worked, all right.

40
00:02:14,654 --> 00:02:17,251
The harvesters
have been destroyed.

41
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:22,036
Good news, I take it.

42
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,097
Ambassador Sharat, I am pleased
to inform you

43
00:02:24,142 --> 00:02:26,579
that we have found a way
to eliminate the harvesters.

44
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:28,447
Excellent.

45
00:02:28,484 --> 00:02:29,851
Well done.

46
00:02:29,888 --> 00:02:32,952
I knew if our people
stopped killing each other

47
00:02:32,994 --> 00:02:35,021
and worked together

48
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:38,631
we could put an end
to these horrible weapons.

49
00:02:38,673 --> 00:02:39,698
This is a symbol

50
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,373
of the new future
we have embarked upon.

51
00:02:42,415 --> 00:02:45,479
Yes, and let's not forget,
we couldn't have done it

52
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:48,790
without the help of our friends
from the Federation.

53
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:51,699
At first, we questioned
Dr. Nydom's decision

54
00:02:51,736 --> 00:02:53,296
to bring in outside help.

55
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,776
Obviously, it was
the right thing to do.

56
00:02:55,811 --> 00:02:58,510
We're all very grateful
for your assistance.

57
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,213
It was our pleasure,
we assure you.

58
00:03:00,254 --> 00:03:03,284
But eliminating the harvesters
is only half the task.

59
00:03:03,328 --> 00:03:05,355
We must make certain
all scientific data

60
00:03:05,432 --> 00:03:07,665
concerned with them
is wiped out as well.

61
00:03:07,704 --> 00:03:08,899
I've purged every file

62
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,966
in the T'Lani
and Kellerun data banks

63
00:03:11,011 --> 00:03:12,571
pertaining to the harvesters.

64
00:03:12,615 --> 00:03:15,816
If anyone gets it in their head
to build these things again

65
00:03:15,855 --> 00:03:17,791
they'll have to start
from scratch.

66
00:03:17,826 --> 00:03:19,055
Then it's finished.

67
00:03:19,096 --> 00:03:20,155
Not quite.

68
00:03:20,198 --> 00:03:22,065
We shouldn't rest

69
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:28,344
until the entire Kellerun
and T'Lani supply of harvesters

70
00:03:28,383 --> 00:03:30,410
has been destroyed.

71
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,787
We will begin immediately.

72
00:05:47,637 --> 00:05:51,338
Commander, I have Dr. Bashir
for you on subspace.

73
00:05:51,378 --> 00:05:52,779
In here.

74
00:05:52,815 --> 00:05:55,548
Commander, we have
some good news to report.

75
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,056
I've already heard.

76
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:58,355
You have?

77
00:05:58,394 --> 00:06:00,023
Yes, I received a message
from both

78
00:06:00,065 --> 00:06:02,035
the T'Lani and Kellerun
Ambassadors, informing me

79
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:03,971
of your success
in neutralizing the harvesters.

80
00:06:04,006 --> 00:06:05,099
Congratulations, gentlemen.

81
00:06:05,143 --> 00:06:06,202
Thank you, sir

82
00:06:06,245 --> 00:06:09,480
but the Doctor here deserves
the bulk of the credit.

83
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,455
Actually, it was a team effort.

84
00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:13,687
The Doctor's just
being modest, sir.

85
00:06:13,728 --> 00:06:16,256
He was the one
who came up with muon rays

86
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,769
as a possible solution.

87
00:06:17,804 --> 00:06:19,137
Luckily, it worked.

88
00:06:19,173 --> 00:06:20,540
When can we expect you back?

89
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:21,770
Soon, I hope.

90
00:06:21,813 --> 00:06:23,248
The Ambassador said something

91
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:25,218
about a celebration
on T'Lani Prime.

92
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:27,018
Yes, it's set for tonight

93
00:06:27,057 --> 00:06:28,924
but the Chief is quite anxious

94
00:06:28,961 --> 00:06:30,828
to return back to the station.

95
00:06:30,865 --> 00:06:32,232
It's been a long week.

96
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:33,760
Still...

97
00:06:33,805 --> 00:06:36,709
I think we can spare you
for another day.

98
00:06:36,745 --> 00:06:39,843
I agree... if that's okay
with you, Chief.

99
00:06:39,885 --> 00:06:42,550
I suppose another day
won't kill me.

100
00:06:42,592 --> 00:06:43,821
That's the spirit.

101
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:46,492
Then we'll expect you back
day after tomorrow.

102
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:47,592
Yes, sir.

103
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:49,104
Enjoy yourselves, gentlemen.

104
00:06:49,138 --> 00:06:51,199
You've earned it.

105
00:07:03,704 --> 00:07:04,933
The last cylinder.

106
00:07:04,973 --> 00:07:09,415
I believe that you should have
the honor, Doctor.

107
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,543
My pleasure.

108
00:07:10,586 --> 00:07:11,919
It's ironic, isn't it

109
00:07:11,956 --> 00:07:15,418
that the war should finally
come to an end up here

110
00:07:15,463 --> 00:07:16,796
above T'Lani III?

111
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:21,606
A planet whose entire population
was decimated by harvesters.

112
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,651
I hope this will be
a lasting peace.

113
00:07:28,526 --> 00:07:30,155
What is this?

114
00:07:30,196 --> 00:07:32,724
Weapons aren't allowed up here.

115
00:08:22,644 --> 00:08:25,115
They're all dead.

116
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:28,019
We will be, too,
if we don't get out of here.

117
00:08:28,056 --> 00:08:30,550
O'Brien to <i>Ganges.</i>

118
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:33,864
Computer, activate remote
transporter sequence.

119
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:36,233
O'Brien to <i>Ganges!</i>

120
00:08:36,274 --> 00:08:37,834
They must be jamming
communications

121
00:08:37,878 --> 00:08:38,903
with the runabout.

122
00:08:40,383 --> 00:08:42,114
We sure as hell can't stay here.

123
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,682
We'll have to beam down
to the surface.

124
00:08:44,726 --> 00:08:46,856
But they'll be able
to follow us.

125
00:08:46,898 --> 00:08:49,369
I'm programming the system
to overload

126
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,339
30 seconds after we transport.

127
00:08:51,374 --> 00:08:52,775
Let's go.

128
00:09:00,327 --> 00:09:03,494
I'll have a cup
of Alterian chowder

129
00:09:03,534 --> 00:09:05,265
uttaberry crepes...

130
00:09:05,305 --> 00:09:06,706
Ah, and a slice of...

131
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:08,140
Kira to Sisko.

132
00:09:08,178 --> 00:09:09,407
Go ahead, Major.

133
00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:11,246
The T'Lani
and Kellerun Ambassadors

134
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:13,016
have just arrived
on the station.

135
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:14,422
They're asking to see you.

136
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,394
Are O'Brien
and Dr. Bashir with them?

137
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:18,593
No, Commander,
and the Ambassadors refuse

138
00:09:18,634 --> 00:09:20,069
to speak to anyone but you.

139
00:09:20,103 --> 00:09:22,438
Show them to my office.
I'll be right there.

140
00:09:22,475 --> 00:09:23,842
Yes, sir.

141
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,371
I'll have to cancel that order.

142
00:09:30,794 --> 00:09:33,595
Are you saying both
of my officers are dead?

143
00:09:33,634 --> 00:09:36,367
Along with some
of our greatest scientists.

144
00:09:36,406 --> 00:09:39,573
We're sorry you had
to share in our misfortune.

145
00:09:39,614 --> 00:09:41,243
What happened?

146
00:09:41,284 --> 00:09:43,517
It was...

147
00:09:43,555 --> 00:09:46,391
It was a terrible accident.

148
00:09:46,428 --> 00:09:48,661
It appears one
of your officers...

149
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,602
a Chief O'Brien, I believe...

150
00:09:50,638 --> 00:09:53,405
inadvertently tripped
a security device.

151
00:09:53,443 --> 00:09:55,276
A lethal pulse of radiation

152
00:09:55,315 --> 00:09:57,650
flooded the room
killing everyone.

153
00:09:57,686 --> 00:10:00,351
Ambassador Sharat
transported off the ship

154
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:03,092
just minutes before
the accident occurred.

155
00:10:03,132 --> 00:10:04,361
This security device?

156
00:10:04,401 --> 00:10:06,064
It was built

157
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:07,937
into the lab's computers
decades ago.

158
00:10:07,976 --> 00:10:09,502
We didn't even know it existed.

159
00:10:09,546 --> 00:10:10,981
If there were no survivors

160
00:10:11,015 --> 00:10:14,011
how do you know that Chief
O'Brien caused the accident?

161
00:10:14,056 --> 00:10:15,787
I was able to return
to the ship

162
00:10:15,826 --> 00:10:17,318
almost immediately
after the accident.

163
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:18,524
The first thing I did

164
00:10:18,565 --> 00:10:20,866
was to check
the internal security sensors.

165
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,963
They recorded
the entire incident.

166
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:25,070
We assumed...

167
00:10:25,113 --> 00:10:28,177
you'd want to see for yourself.

168
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,786
Thank you.

169
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,327
Commander, I...

170
00:10:36,372 --> 00:10:37,533
I just want you to know

171
00:10:37,574 --> 00:10:40,011
we don't blame Chief O'Brien
for what happened.

172
00:10:40,046 --> 00:10:41,743
On the contrary.

173
00:10:41,783 --> 00:10:44,584
Both he and Dr. Bashir
will always be considered heroes

174
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:46,388
to both the Kellerun
and the T'Lani.

175
00:10:46,427 --> 00:10:47,760
Without their help

176
00:10:47,796 --> 00:10:50,199
we never could have
destroyed the harvesters.

177
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:53,470
Please extend our sympathies
to their families.

178
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:55,912
I'll do that.

179
00:11:49,265 --> 00:11:50,700
Chief. Chief.

180
00:11:50,735 --> 00:11:52,865
In here.

181
00:11:52,906 --> 00:11:54,808
Wait!

182
00:11:54,844 --> 00:11:56,108
Don't touch anything.

183
00:11:56,146 --> 00:11:57,307
But why not?

184
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,513
There's food
and medical supplies.

185
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:01,251
Yeah, they could
be booby-trapped.

186
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:03,593
The Cardassians used
to rig the supplies

187
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:05,930
they left behind
with pressure grenades.

188
00:12:05,968 --> 00:12:07,733
I've seen more than one soldier

189
00:12:07,772 --> 00:12:09,970
permanently lose
his appetite that way.

190
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:11,219
Well, did you find anything?

191
00:12:11,353 --> 00:12:13,050
Looks all right.

192
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,251
Good.

193
00:12:17,366 --> 00:12:19,599
At least we won't starve.

194
00:12:21,676 --> 00:12:22,644
Here.

195
00:12:22,678 --> 00:12:24,113
No.

196
00:12:24,148 --> 00:12:25,116
Why not, Chief?

197
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,517
I thought you loved
military rations.

198
00:12:26,586 --> 00:12:28,215
Yeah, Federation rations.

199
00:12:28,257 --> 00:12:30,785
I've had enough T'Lani food
this past week

200
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:32,230
to last me a lifetime.

201
00:12:38,112 --> 00:12:39,979
Well, we've got
to keep our strength up.

202
00:12:40,016 --> 00:12:41,679
We're going to have to find
some way

203
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,553
of warning the T'Lani
that the Kelleruns

204
00:12:43,657 --> 00:12:44,716
have broken the treaty.

205
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,955
I still can't figure it.

206
00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:47,430
Why would the Kelleruns wait

207
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,095
till the harvesters
were destroyed

208
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:50,605
before they made their move?

209
00:12:52,109 --> 00:12:53,270
Maybe they didn't hand over

210
00:12:53,312 --> 00:12:54,804
all the harvesters
for destruction.

211
00:12:54,849 --> 00:12:56,044
Maybe they're convinced

212
00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:58,885
they can defeat the T'Lani
with conventional weapons.

213
00:12:58,924 --> 00:13:00,325
I suppose, but that might mean

214
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,524
continuing the war
for another hundred years.

215
00:13:02,565 --> 00:13:04,763
Well, whatever the reason,
we'd better keep moving.

216
00:13:04,804 --> 00:13:06,467
Wait! Listen to me, Julian.

217
00:13:06,508 --> 00:13:10,107
The Kelleruns are going to
expect us to be on the move.

218
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:12,176
We start running,
their sensors will pick us up

219
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,519
before we've gone a kilometer.

220
00:13:13,556 --> 00:13:15,549
If we stay still,
maybe, just maybe

221
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,859
it'll take them longer
to find us.

222
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:19,698
The way I see it,
we have only one chance

223
00:13:19,737 --> 00:13:21,764
to survive this thing

224
00:13:21,808 --> 00:13:23,402
and that's to stay alive
long enough

225
00:13:23,445 --> 00:13:24,880
for Commander Sisko to find us.

226
00:13:24,915 --> 00:13:27,079
But that won't be
for at least another day.

227
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:29,716
He still thinks we're
celebrating on T'Lani Prime.

228
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:32,560
I said it was our only chance.

229
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:36,097
I didn't say it was a good one.

230
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,054
What have we here?

231
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,131
Looks like some
kind of com system.

232
00:13:51,172 --> 00:13:54,270
Maybe we can contact
the T'Lani from here.

233
00:13:54,312 --> 00:13:56,875
Do you think
you can get it working?

234
00:13:56,918 --> 00:13:59,014
Well, I'll have to open it up...

235
00:13:59,056 --> 00:14:01,823
see if there's
a backup power supply.

236
00:14:07,408 --> 00:14:10,073
Why don't you take
a seat, Doctor?

237
00:14:10,114 --> 00:14:12,881
Well, I thought
maybe I could help.

238
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,483
I took the engineering
extension courses

239
00:14:15,525 --> 00:14:16,892
at Starfleet Medical.

240
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:18,262
Extension courses?

241
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:20,532
They were actually
quite informative.

242
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,629
Julian?

243
00:14:21,673 --> 00:14:22,800
Hmm?

244
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:24,435
Do you really want to help me?

245
00:14:24,478 --> 00:14:25,446
Yes.

246
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,211
Then let me do my job.

247
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:30,189
Of course.

248
00:14:30,224 --> 00:14:33,629
I'll, uh, I'll inventory
the supplies, then.

249
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:36,501
Fine. Why don't you do that?

250
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:44,348
The last cylinder.

251
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:47,487
I believe that you should have
the honor, Doctor.

252
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:49,328
My pleasure.

253
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:07,764
The harvesters
have been destroyed.

254
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,208
Congratulations.

255
00:15:09,244 --> 00:15:10,907
Thank you.

256
00:15:10,947 --> 00:15:12,849
We must make certain
that all records

257
00:15:12,885 --> 00:15:14,548
of their existence
are wiped out.

258
00:15:14,588 --> 00:15:18,050
I've purged every file in the
T'Lani and Kellerun data banks

259
00:15:18,096 --> 00:15:19,588
pertaining to the harvesters.

260
00:15:19,633 --> 00:15:22,902
If anyone gets it in their head
to build these things again

261
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,842
they'll have to start
from scratch.

262
00:15:24,878 --> 00:15:26,404
Then it's finished.

263
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:32,186
Hold on.
What's this?

264
00:15:32,227 --> 00:15:33,252
Chief?

265
00:15:33,297 --> 00:15:34,732
I don't know.

266
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,100
Closing the last file
seems to have activated

267
00:15:37,138 --> 00:15:38,732
some kind of security program.

268
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:39,936
It looks like it was part

269
00:15:39,978 --> 00:15:41,538
of the original
operating system.

270
00:15:41,582 --> 00:15:42,572
I can't shut it down.

271
00:15:42,617 --> 00:15:44,109
Do you know
anything about this?

272
00:15:44,154 --> 00:15:45,315
No.

273
00:15:45,356 --> 00:15:47,850
Maybe you should try
cutting the power.

274
00:15:47,895 --> 00:15:50,492
It's not responding.

275
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,375
I've heard of security
weapons like this...

276
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,355
a radiation pulse that
vaporizes any intruder

277
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:02,587
who doesn't enter
the proper code.

278
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,225
I'm surprised the Chief
didn't detect it.

279
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:07,431
It must have been buried
very deep in the system.

280
00:16:07,472 --> 00:16:08,633
I'd like to talk

281
00:16:08,674 --> 00:16:11,510
to the Chief of Security
for that ship.

282
00:16:11,547 --> 00:16:13,380
So would I.

283
00:16:13,418 --> 00:16:15,411
Remember, they lost people, too.

284
00:16:15,455 --> 00:16:18,222
But the T'Lani were responsible
for O'Brien and Bashir's safety.

285
00:16:18,262 --> 00:16:20,061
They should have known
about that device

286
00:16:20,099 --> 00:16:21,158
and deactivated it.

287
00:16:21,202 --> 00:16:22,933
That will do, Major.

288
00:16:24,944 --> 00:16:27,711
I'd like for you to contact
Bajoran medical officials.

289
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:28,739
We'll need a doctor

290
00:16:28,785 --> 00:16:30,881
to be temporarily assigned
to the station

291
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:34,226
until Starfleet can send us
a replacement for Dr. Bashir.

292
00:16:34,264 --> 00:16:38,330
Dax, inform Starfleet
of the accident.

293
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:41,574
Tell them we'll need
a new Medical Officer

294
00:16:41,613 --> 00:16:44,016
and a new Chief of Operations.

295
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,986
Would you like me to go
with you to see Mrs. O'Brien?

296
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:53,164
No, I'll take care of it.

297
00:16:53,205 --> 00:16:56,736
Find out how I can contact
Julian's family.

298
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:02,786
Major, inform the crew we'll
be holding a memorial service

299
00:17:02,826 --> 00:17:05,093
tomorrow evening at 1800 hours.

300
00:17:05,132 --> 00:17:07,228
Yes, sir.

301
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:09,763
All right, people

302
00:17:09,808 --> 00:17:12,781
I know the next few days
are going to be hard

303
00:17:12,815 --> 00:17:15,412
but we all have jobs to do.

304
00:17:16,891 --> 00:17:18,417
Dismissed.

305
00:17:35,064 --> 00:17:36,727
So, having any luck?

306
00:17:36,768 --> 00:17:39,467
I wish you'd stop
asking me that.

307
00:17:39,507 --> 00:17:40,668
I'm sorry.

308
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:42,873
It's just all this
standing around.

309
00:17:42,981 --> 00:17:45,885
At least you're doing
something constructive.

310
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:49,520
You just keep your eyes open
for any Kellerun soldiers.

311
00:17:49,562 --> 00:17:52,558
Don't worry, I will.

312
00:17:56,677 --> 00:17:58,306
It's such a mess in here.

313
00:17:58,348 --> 00:18:00,045
You'll make it work, Chief.

314
00:18:00,086 --> 00:18:02,284
This is the kind
of challenge you live for.

315
00:18:02,323 --> 00:18:04,658
You know, I was looking forward

316
00:18:04,695 --> 00:18:06,859
to the celebrations
on T'Lani Prime.

317
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:08,734
I don't know if you've noticed

318
00:18:08,771 --> 00:18:11,106
but T'Lani women
are quite attractive.

319
00:18:11,143 --> 00:18:13,512
I'm not blind, you know.

320
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:14,676
Of course not.

321
00:18:14,717 --> 00:18:16,380
But you are married.

322
00:18:16,421 --> 00:18:18,084
Just 'cause you're married

323
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,494
doesn't mean you stop
looking at women.

324
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,933
Just as long as you don't
let your wife see you look.

325
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:28,246
For me, tonight's celebrations
would have been an adventure.

326
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,811
The most you could have hoped
for was a good meal.

327
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:34,589
Women...
that's all you think about.

328
00:18:34,628 --> 00:18:36,393
No, it isn't.

329
00:18:36,432 --> 00:18:39,336
Although I do think
about them a lot.

330
00:18:39,372 --> 00:18:44,338
Yeah, well, one of these days
you'll fall in love with one.

331
00:18:44,383 --> 00:18:46,547
I did once.

332
00:18:46,587 --> 00:18:48,717
Not work out?

333
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:51,789
Not quite.

334
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,769
Close.

335
00:18:53,803 --> 00:18:56,172
Oh, I don't know.

336
00:18:56,209 --> 00:19:00,173
Somehow, marriage
just doesn't seem fair.

337
00:19:00,218 --> 00:19:01,710
Fair?

338
00:19:01,754 --> 00:19:03,314
Fair... to them.

339
00:19:03,357 --> 00:19:04,758
I mean, look at us.

340
00:19:04,794 --> 00:19:06,855
Our lives are constantly
in danger.

341
00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:08,835
There's enough to worry about

342
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,934
without worrying about
the wife and kids at home

343
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,239
worrying about us.

344
00:19:15,865 --> 00:19:18,166
I'm sorry, Chief.

345
00:19:18,204 --> 00:19:21,177
I just feel that way.

346
00:19:21,211 --> 00:19:23,876
A lot of career officers
feel that way.

347
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:28,484
Well, you career officers
don't know what you're missing.

348
00:19:28,527 --> 00:19:30,930
Really?

349
00:19:32,602 --> 00:19:34,538
That may be so.

350
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:38,275
I just look at you
and Mrs. O'Brien, and I...

351
00:19:39,952 --> 00:19:42,583
What about me and Mrs. O'Brien?

352
00:19:42,624 --> 00:19:45,391
Nothing.

353
00:19:45,431 --> 00:19:47,230
What?

354
00:19:47,268 --> 00:19:49,238
Nothing, absolutely nothing.

355
00:19:54,718 --> 00:19:58,921
It's no secret that your
assignment to this station

356
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,956
hasn't been conducive
to your marriage.

357
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,994
Say that again?

358
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:08,139
Why don't we just forget it?

359
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,244
That's the first
intelligent thing you've said

360
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:12,814
since we got here.

361
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,098
Are you cold?

362
00:20:33,135 --> 00:20:34,502
Yes, aren't you?

363
00:20:34,605 --> 00:20:37,669
No. Actually,
it's quite warm in here.

364
00:20:37,712 --> 00:20:40,411
You're looking a little pale.

365
00:20:40,452 --> 00:20:41,944
I'm fine.

366
00:20:43,257 --> 00:20:46,458
Your blood pressure's low
and you're running a fever.

367
00:20:46,498 --> 00:20:47,762
You better sit down.

368
00:20:47,801 --> 00:20:49,361
I don't want to sit down.

369
00:20:49,404 --> 00:20:50,668
I've got work to do.

370
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,006
Roll up your sleeve.

371
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:53,012
Why?

372
00:20:53,046 --> 00:20:54,207
Do it.

373
00:20:54,248 --> 00:20:55,375
Please.

374
00:21:00,629 --> 00:21:05,299
You were behind the genetic bath
when it shattered, weren't you?

375
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,005
You have something
to tell me, Doctor?

376
00:21:08,046 --> 00:21:10,847
You've been infected
by the harvesters.

377
00:21:32,732 --> 00:21:34,725
Come in.

378
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:39,139
Commander Sisko.

379
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,895
Keiko.

380
00:21:51,073 --> 00:21:53,567
Something's happened to Miles.

381
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,605
There was an accident.

382
00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:00,457
Both your husband and Dr. Bashir
were involved.

383
00:22:00,494 --> 00:22:02,123
They're dead.

384
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:05,130
I'm sorry.

385
00:22:07,676 --> 00:22:10,045
Tell me what happened.

386
00:22:10,081 --> 00:22:14,489
The T'Lani security sensors
recorded the entire incident.

387
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,306
I want to see it.

388
00:22:23,344 --> 00:22:25,211
I'll have it sent to you.

389
00:22:26,918 --> 00:22:31,623
Miles was a fine officer
and a fine man.

390
00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:33,255
I'll miss him.

391
00:22:34,903 --> 00:22:36,634
Thank you, Commander.

392
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:40,738
I would like to be alone now.

393
00:22:40,782 --> 00:22:45,953
If there's anything you need,
just let me know.

394
00:23:01,795 --> 00:23:03,094
Chief?

395
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,567
It's my eyes.

396
00:23:04,602 --> 00:23:06,869
They're... getting fuzzy.

397
00:23:06,906 --> 00:23:09,173
You better sit down.
I'll take over from here.

398
00:23:09,211 --> 00:23:11,010
What makes you think
you can fix this?

399
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:13,110
Because you're going
to talk me through it.

400
00:23:13,154 --> 00:23:14,919
Now take a seat.

401
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,227
Maybe...

402
00:23:21,572 --> 00:23:24,203
just for a minute...

403
00:23:27,819 --> 00:23:29,482
or two.

404
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:33,094
Now, tell me where you left off.

405
00:23:33,131 --> 00:23:37,698
You see the dark blue coil
in the upper right-hand corner?

406
00:23:37,774 --> 00:23:39,539
No.

407
00:23:39,578 --> 00:23:41,138
It's there...

408
00:23:41,181 --> 00:23:42,707
beside the...

409
00:23:42,785 --> 00:23:45,120
the green cylinder.

410
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:47,458
Just... just below it.

411
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:50,058
Yeah, I see it.

412
00:23:50,101 --> 00:23:52,197
You have to...

413
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,685
you have to lock
the base of the coil

414
00:23:57,718 --> 00:24:02,057
into the tiny receptor...
just below it.

415
00:24:06,938 --> 00:24:08,965
You know, I just remembered

416
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:12,415
I still have Julian's
medical school diaries.

417
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,421
He let you read them?

418
00:24:14,455 --> 00:24:17,951
He felt they would help me
understand him better.

419
00:24:17,995 --> 00:24:21,662
How? By reading about
all the women he went out with?

420
00:24:21,704 --> 00:24:23,834
That's not what they were about.

421
00:24:23,876 --> 00:24:25,368
When he gave them to me

422
00:24:25,412 --> 00:24:29,217
he told me that they were about
his innermost thoughts...

423
00:24:29,254 --> 00:24:33,127
his struggle to graduate
top of his class

424
00:24:33,163 --> 00:24:36,762
his dream of having a career
in Starfleet

425
00:24:36,804 --> 00:24:40,609
his constant fear of failure.

426
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:43,774
Really.

427
00:24:43,852 --> 00:24:45,788
And did you?

428
00:24:45,857 --> 00:24:47,417
Understand him better?

429
00:24:50,267 --> 00:24:52,738
I never got around
to reading them.

430
00:24:54,676 --> 00:24:58,172
I suppose I should send them
to his parents.

431
00:24:59,387 --> 00:25:00,913
You could keep them.

432
00:25:02,227 --> 00:25:03,286
Really?

433
00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:05,766
I think he'd like that.

434
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:07,895
He cared a great deal about you.

435
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,669
I know.

436
00:25:11,714 --> 00:25:13,947
I cared about him, too.

437
00:25:21,034 --> 00:25:23,938
These, um... are on the house.

438
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,137
How come?

439
00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:27,808
I thought we'd have a toast

440
00:25:27,849 --> 00:25:30,788
to the memory of Chief
O'Brien and Dr. Bashir.

441
00:25:30,823 --> 00:25:33,386
That's very thoughtful, Quark.

442
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:38,365
I can be thoughtful.

443
00:25:42,715 --> 00:25:44,948
To our dear, departed comrades.

444
00:25:44,987 --> 00:25:49,156
We may have had our differences,
but I'll say this for them...

445
00:25:49,196 --> 00:25:52,658
and it's the highest
tribute I can think of...

446
00:25:52,704 --> 00:25:54,606
they were good customers.

447
00:25:54,641 --> 00:25:59,208
They always paid
their bar bills on time.

448
00:25:59,252 --> 00:26:00,379
That's it?

449
00:26:00,421 --> 00:26:02,357
I'm not done yet.

450
00:26:02,392 --> 00:26:05,832
At times like this,
I'm reminded of

451
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,804
the 57th Rule of Acquisition:

452
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:12,540
"Good customers are
as rare as latinum."

453
00:26:14,986 --> 00:26:16,683
"Treasure them."

454
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:47,004
Mrs. O'Brien...

455
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,341
Major, I need to see
Commander Sisko.

456
00:26:49,379 --> 00:26:50,678
It's very important.

457
00:26:50,716 --> 00:26:52,185
I'll tell him you're here.

458
00:26:52,218 --> 00:26:55,122
I just wanted you to know
how sorry I am...

459
00:26:55,158 --> 00:26:56,752
how sorry we all are.

460
00:26:56,829 --> 00:26:58,264
Thank you.

461
00:27:00,971 --> 00:27:04,103
If anyone gets it in their head
to build these things again...

462
00:27:04,145 --> 00:27:06,241
Watch. It's coming up
in just a few seconds.

463
00:27:06,283 --> 00:27:08,618
Then it's finished.

464
00:27:08,655 --> 00:27:10,625
Computer, freeze image.

465
00:27:10,659 --> 00:27:12,720
There.
Do you see it?

466
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,265
I see the Chief drinking coffee.

467
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:15,428
Exactly.

468
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:17,166
Now look at the time index.

469
00:27:17,206 --> 00:27:18,231
1500 hours.

470
00:27:18,276 --> 00:27:19,369
That's right.

471
00:27:19,412 --> 00:27:20,539
Late afternoon.

472
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,678
Miles never drinks coffee
late in the afternoon.

473
00:27:23,721 --> 00:27:25,088
It keeps him up all night.

474
00:27:25,124 --> 00:27:26,616
Maybe he made
an exception this time...

475
00:27:26,661 --> 00:27:28,460
working long hours,
under a lot of stress...

476
00:27:28,498 --> 00:27:29,727
I know my husband.

477
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:32,295
He never drinks coffee
late in the day.

478
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,037
Maybe he isn't drinking coffee.

479
00:27:34,078 --> 00:27:35,171
Maybe it's tea.

480
00:27:35,213 --> 00:27:36,580
I checked the data clip.

481
00:27:36,616 --> 00:27:38,780
It contained
a spectroscopic analysis.

482
00:27:38,821 --> 00:27:40,791
The liquid in Miles's
cup consists

483
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,024
of vegetable-based
oils and caffeine.

484
00:27:43,063 --> 00:27:44,031
It's coffee, all right.

485
00:27:44,065 --> 00:27:45,033
You're suggesting

486
00:27:45,068 --> 00:27:46,731
someone tampered
with this recording?

487
00:27:46,772 --> 00:27:48,799
Yes, I am, and I want
to know the reason why.

488
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:50,937
Lieutenant, when
were you planning

489
00:27:50,981 --> 00:27:53,475
on bringing the <i>Ganges</i>
back from T'Lani III?

490
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,545
Tomorrow.

491
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:56,753
I don't see any reason
to wait, do you?

492
00:27:56,794 --> 00:27:58,286
I'll leave right away.

493
00:27:58,331 --> 00:28:00,529
Good.
I'll come with you.

494
00:28:01,738 --> 00:28:05,907
Mrs. O'Brien, if this recording
has been altered,

495
00:28:05,947 --> 00:28:07,576
we'll find out why.

496
00:28:18,842 --> 00:28:20,607
You were right, Chief.

497
00:28:20,646 --> 00:28:23,778
The contacts on the
sub-processor are corroded.

498
00:28:25,323 --> 00:28:26,792
Yeah.

499
00:28:26,827 --> 00:28:28,558
They need to be cleaned.

500
00:28:28,597 --> 00:28:30,830
Oh, um, I think
there are some sterile pads

501
00:28:30,902 --> 00:28:33,032
in the med kit.

502
00:28:38,251 --> 00:28:39,515
Here we go.

503
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:46,800
Don't leave me, Chief.

504
00:28:46,837 --> 00:28:47,896
I still need you.

505
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:51,580
Don't worry.

506
00:28:51,614 --> 00:28:53,277
I'm not going anywhere.

507
00:28:58,396 --> 00:28:59,922
So, who was she?

508
00:29:01,536 --> 00:29:02,526
Who?

509
00:29:02,572 --> 00:29:05,169
"Not quite. Close."

510
00:29:07,048 --> 00:29:08,608
Palis. Palis Delon.

511
00:29:08,652 --> 00:29:11,089
She was a dancer... a ballerina.

512
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,721
She had the most exquisite feet.

513
00:29:14,865 --> 00:29:16,164
I'm serious.

514
00:29:16,201 --> 00:29:20,142
It's very important for a dancer
to have good arches.

515
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:22,580
She was gorgeous

516
00:29:22,616 --> 00:29:24,279
not to mention brilliant.

517
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,256
I used to watch her onstage.

518
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:29,730
I couldn't believe how anyone
could be so graceful.

519
00:29:29,764 --> 00:29:32,794
And she was crazy
about you, huh?

520
00:29:32,838 --> 00:29:36,539
We were crazy about each other.

521
00:29:36,579 --> 00:29:40,110
I used to think,
"Julian, you lucky devil.

522
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:42,887
You found the perfect woman."

523
00:29:42,927 --> 00:29:45,866
We used to finish
each other's thoughts.

524
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,870
There.

525
00:29:52,214 --> 00:29:53,649
What do you think?

526
00:29:53,684 --> 00:29:56,657
Good... good.

527
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,093
Put it back in the com panel.

528
00:30:14,663 --> 00:30:17,328
Looks like we have some power,
anyway.

529
00:30:26,622 --> 00:30:29,321
Still no response
from the transmitter, though.

530
00:30:29,362 --> 00:30:32,665
Try re-tuning
the R-F oscillators.

531
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:39,477
So what happened
with you and Palis?

532
00:30:39,518 --> 00:30:41,785
What happened is I graduated.

533
00:30:41,823 --> 00:30:44,556
Her father was
the top administrator

534
00:30:44,596 --> 00:30:46,965
at a medical complex in Paris.

535
00:30:47,001 --> 00:30:48,561
He offered me a job.

536
00:30:48,605 --> 00:30:52,569
Promised I'd be Chief of Surgery
within five years.

537
00:30:52,613 --> 00:30:56,520
But you would have to give up
your Starfleet career.

538
00:30:56,555 --> 00:31:00,051
I can't tell you
how close I came.

539
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:03,433
But... here I am.

540
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:06,203
You made your choice.

541
00:31:06,243 --> 00:31:07,472
Yeah.

542
00:31:07,512 --> 00:31:10,713
Sometimes, I wake up
in the middle of the night

543
00:31:10,753 --> 00:31:12,484
and I think to myself...

544
00:31:12,523 --> 00:31:16,555
will I ever find anyone
that wonderful again?

545
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:18,797
The oscillator's working

546
00:31:18,838 --> 00:31:21,105
but the frequency's
still fluctuating.

547
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,407
Let me take a look.

548
00:31:26,421 --> 00:31:27,446
Oh!

549
00:31:32,702 --> 00:31:33,761
What is it?

550
00:31:33,804 --> 00:31:37,107
It's... my legs.

551
00:31:37,144 --> 00:31:39,411
I can't feel them.

552
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:48,290
We're approaching T'Lani III.

553
00:31:48,335 --> 00:31:50,863
Establishing a synchronous orbit
alongside the <i>Ganges.</i>

554
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:53,539
Open a channel
to the T'Lani cruiser.

555
00:31:53,581 --> 00:31:57,021
Commander Sisko,
what a pleasant surprise.

556
00:31:57,055 --> 00:31:58,922
I take it you're here
for your runabout?

557
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,086
That's correct.

558
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:01,255
We were about to leave

559
00:32:01,298 --> 00:32:03,667
for the memorial service
on T'Lani Prime.

560
00:32:03,703 --> 00:32:05,536
You're welcome to accompany us.

561
00:32:05,573 --> 00:32:06,940
Perhaps we will, but first

562
00:32:06,977 --> 00:32:10,041
I'd like to see for myself
where the accident took place.

563
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:12,953
Of course.

564
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,619
While you're on the cruiser

565
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,391
I think I'll beam
over to the <i>Ganges</i>

566
00:32:16,431 --> 00:32:17,798
and take a look around.

567
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:19,029
Good idea.

568
00:32:25,684 --> 00:32:27,449
Chief.

569
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:29,549
Chief, it's working.

570
00:32:29,593 --> 00:32:31,460
Signal's very faint.

571
00:32:31,497 --> 00:32:35,768
You'll have to switch to
a higher-carrier frequency.

572
00:32:35,806 --> 00:32:39,143
Reset the actuators
on the chambers coil.

573
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,173
That's better.
It's still pretty weak, though.

574
00:32:41,252 --> 00:32:42,619
I'm sending a distress signal.

575
00:32:42,654 --> 00:32:44,283
It's set to repeat
every two minutes.

576
00:32:44,325 --> 00:32:46,796
Let's hope the T'Lani find us
before the Kelleruns do.

577
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,734
They better get here soon.

578
00:32:51,541 --> 00:32:52,840
Don't worry, Chief.

579
00:32:52,878 --> 00:32:54,780
I'm going to get you home.

580
00:32:56,852 --> 00:32:57,979
In a box, maybe.

581
00:32:58,022 --> 00:32:58,990
Nonsense.

582
00:32:59,024 --> 00:33:02,054
Don't go giving up on me now.

583
00:33:02,098 --> 00:33:03,965
I'm not giving up.

584
00:33:04,002 --> 00:33:04,605
I'm dying.

585
00:33:06,542 --> 00:33:08,979
Listen to me...
listen to me, Julian.

586
00:33:10,785 --> 00:33:13,552
You must tell Keiko and Molly...

587
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,857
You tell them yourself.

588
00:33:19,771 --> 00:33:21,901
You were wrong, you know...

589
00:33:21,942 --> 00:33:23,536
about marriage.

590
00:33:23,579 --> 00:33:25,572
Whatever you say, Chief.

591
00:33:25,617 --> 00:33:27,713
Listen to me, Julian!

592
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,156
You're the one

593
00:33:29,192 --> 00:33:32,825
who's always talking
about adventure.

594
00:33:32,867 --> 00:33:34,461
Ha... adventure.

595
00:33:34,504 --> 00:33:39,209
Marriage is the greatest
adventure of them all.

596
00:33:39,247 --> 00:33:43,188
It's filled with
pitfalls and setbacks

597
00:33:43,223 --> 00:33:45,216
and mistakes and...

598
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,427
but it's a journey
worth taking...

599
00:33:48,467 --> 00:33:51,406
because you take it together.

600
00:33:51,441 --> 00:33:57,353
I know Keiko's been unhappy
about us coming to the station.

601
00:33:57,387 --> 00:33:59,824
We still argue about it.

602
00:33:59,859 --> 00:34:01,829
But that's all right

603
00:34:01,863 --> 00:34:04,494
because at the end of the day

604
00:34:04,537 --> 00:34:07,476
we both know
we love each other.

605
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:09,001
Chief...

606
00:34:09,046 --> 00:34:10,606
And that's all that matters.

607
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:11,618
Chief...

608
00:34:11,652 --> 00:34:12,620
Huh?

609
00:34:12,654 --> 00:34:14,214
You better get some rest.

610
00:34:24,881 --> 00:34:27,284
The T'Lani will be here soon.

611
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:35,230
I see there's still
some residual traces

612
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,830
of the radiation pulse.

613
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:40,041
Well, that's to be expected
given the pulse's intensity

614
00:34:40,081 --> 00:34:41,550
but it poses no danger.

615
00:34:41,584 --> 00:34:42,711
Tell me, Ambassador

616
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,722
have you been able
to learn anything else

617
00:34:44,758 --> 00:34:47,993
about the fail-safe device
that caused the accident?

618
00:34:48,032 --> 00:34:50,265
Not yet, Commander,
but we're working on it.

619
00:34:50,303 --> 00:34:52,740
It was Ambassador Sharat that
brought you the data clip?

620
00:34:52,808 --> 00:34:54,107
That's right.

621
00:34:54,145 --> 00:34:55,614
And I suppose
he showed it to you

622
00:34:55,649 --> 00:34:56,708
as soon as you arrived?

623
00:34:56,751 --> 00:34:59,086
Of course.

624
00:34:59,123 --> 00:35:02,324
Could the clip have been
altered before you saw it?

625
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:09,007
Why would Ambassador Sharat
alter the data clip?

626
00:35:09,045 --> 00:35:10,571
I have no idea.

627
00:35:10,615 --> 00:35:12,278
Dax to Sisko.

628
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:13,652
Sisko.

629
00:35:13,688 --> 00:35:15,282
Commander,
when you're through there

630
00:35:15,325 --> 00:35:16,726
could you join me on the <i>Ganges?</i>

631
00:35:16,795 --> 00:35:20,291
Yes, I'll be here
a few more minutes.

632
00:35:20,336 --> 00:35:22,466
Commander, the T'Lani
and the Kellerun

633
00:35:22,507 --> 00:35:23,874
have finally made peace.

634
00:35:23,911 --> 00:35:25,346
That peace cannot survive

635
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,407
unless both sides
trust each other.

636
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,773
What have you got, Dax?

637
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:40,642
It looks like someone
erased five seconds

638
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:42,048
from the <i>Ganges'</i> computer log.

639
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:43,780
Show me.

640
00:35:43,855 --> 00:35:46,349
At first, I thought it was just
some kind of power fluctuation.

641
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,023
But when I checked
the log's memory core

642
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:50,034
it showed traces
of a remote transport command.

643
00:35:50,068 --> 00:35:51,367
Did you find any indication

644
00:35:51,405 --> 00:35:53,102
of transport activity
at that time?

645
00:35:53,142 --> 00:35:54,235
No.

646
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,541
And you're saying

647
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,809
somebody erased it later on?

648
00:35:56,916 --> 00:35:59,410
Look at the time index when
the call for transport came in.

649
00:35:59,455 --> 00:36:01,425
1534... that's
a full three minutes

650
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,897
after the accident
on the T'Lani cruiser.

651
00:36:03,932 --> 00:36:06,631
Which means if either
Chief O'Brien or Julian

652
00:36:06,671 --> 00:36:07,900
made that request...

653
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,500
They would have been alive

654
00:36:09,544 --> 00:36:11,708
after the fail-safe device
went off.

655
00:36:11,749 --> 00:36:13,150
Good work, Lieutenant.

656
00:36:17,094 --> 00:36:18,289
Chief...

657
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,320
Chief!

658
00:36:19,365 --> 00:36:21,232
Don't leave me now.

659
00:36:21,269 --> 00:36:22,430
Breathe.

660
00:36:22,473 --> 00:36:23,806
That's better.

661
00:36:23,876 --> 00:36:25,869
Now you're doing it.

662
00:36:33,931 --> 00:36:35,662
Tell me, Julian...

663
00:36:35,702 --> 00:36:39,666
ever talk to that
ballerina of yours?

664
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:43,013
Not since I left Earth.

665
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:45,647
Well, maybe...
maybe you should.

666
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:47,561
Well, maybe one day I will.

667
00:36:47,561 --> 00:36:48,051
Well, maybe one day I will.

668
00:37:06,168 --> 00:37:07,831
Ambassador E'Tyshra.

669
00:37:07,905 --> 00:37:09,134
Am I glad to see you.

670
00:37:09,175 --> 00:37:11,042
Chief O'Brien was infected
by the harvesters

671
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:12,673
when the Kelleruns
attacked your ship.

672
00:37:12,716 --> 00:37:14,185
They killed
all of the scientists.

673
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,213
Not all of them.

674
00:37:16,257 --> 00:37:17,851
You're too late, Sharat.

675
00:37:17,927 --> 00:37:19,829
No, Doctor, he's right on time.

676
00:37:19,865 --> 00:37:22,804
But why kill
Nydom and the others?

677
00:37:22,838 --> 00:37:24,137
To ensure
that the peace agreement

678
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:25,439
between our two races will last.

679
00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:27,344
But we'd already destroyed
the harvesters.

680
00:37:27,382 --> 00:37:30,149
There was no reason
for more killings, unless...

681
00:37:30,188 --> 00:37:32,887
It's not enough to simply
destroy the harvesters.

682
00:37:32,927 --> 00:37:35,626
We have to be sure
no one can ever recreate them.

683
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:38,571
The only way to do that
was to eliminate everyone

684
00:37:38,606 --> 00:37:41,875
who possessed such knowledge,
including the two of you.

685
00:37:41,913 --> 00:37:45,444
But we have no use
for such horrible weapons.

686
00:37:45,488 --> 00:37:48,928
As long as the knowledge exists,
there's a danger it may be used.

687
00:37:48,996 --> 00:37:51,160
That's a risk
we refuse to live with.

688
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,669
I truly am sorry, Doctor

689
00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:55,039
but at least you
have the consolation

690
00:37:55,076 --> 00:37:58,447
of knowing that your deaths
will be for a noble cause.

691
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:22,702
Wait.

692
00:38:22,737 --> 00:38:24,502
Let him speak.

693
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,875
Help me...
help me up.

694
00:38:34,262 --> 00:38:36,061
I want to die on my feet.

695
00:38:37,603 --> 00:38:42,068
I'm sorry I didn't
get us home, Chief.

696
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:43,706
You did your best.

697
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:48,723
It's been an honor...
serving with you.

698
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,756
Thank you, Chief.

699
00:38:54,005 --> 00:38:55,702
That means a lot.

700
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,059
Commander, am I glad to see you!

701
00:39:08,604 --> 00:39:10,768
Chief O'Brien is going
to be dead within the hour

702
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:12,608
if we don't get him back
to the station.

703
00:39:12,646 --> 00:39:13,875
What happened?

704
00:39:13,915 --> 00:39:15,714
He was exposed
to the harvesters.

705
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:17,250
That should stabilize him
for now.

706
00:39:17,382 --> 00:39:19,352
They told us
you were both dead, Julian.

707
00:39:19,387 --> 00:39:20,616
We would have been

708
00:39:20,656 --> 00:39:22,649
if the T'Lani and Kelleruns
had had their way.

709
00:39:22,695 --> 00:39:24,164
They're killing
everyone involved

710
00:39:24,198 --> 00:39:25,223
with the harvesters project.

711
00:39:25,267 --> 00:39:26,702
The T'Lani cruiser's
coming this way.

712
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:27,703
They're hailing us.

713
00:39:27,772 --> 00:39:28,865
Ignore them.

714
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,038
Send a general distress signal

715
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,711
on all Federation
subspace frequencies.

716
00:39:33,819 --> 00:39:36,586
They're blocking
all subspace communication

717
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:38,424
with a broadband inversion.

718
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:40,456
They're hailing us again.

719
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,464
Is the inversion field
affecting sensors, as well?

720
00:39:44,509 --> 00:39:47,140
All short-range
sensors are useless.

721
00:39:47,181 --> 00:39:48,912
Which means...

722
00:39:48,952 --> 00:39:50,615
theirs are useless, too.

723
00:40:01,947 --> 00:40:05,250
Ambassador, Commander Sisko
is attempting to escape.

724
00:40:05,288 --> 00:40:06,278
We are in pursuit.

725
00:40:06,323 --> 00:40:07,792
Can we overtake them?

726
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,354
Their runabout
is no match for this ship.

727
00:40:10,399 --> 00:40:11,698
Fire a warning shot.

728
00:40:13,005 --> 00:40:14,941
Confirmed.

729
00:40:14,975 --> 00:40:17,674
Commander Sisko is hailing us.

730
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:18,808
I thought he would.

731
00:40:18,918 --> 00:40:21,914
By firing on this vessel

732
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:24,259
you've committed an act of war
against the Federation.

733
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,666
Commander, we have no quarrel
with the Federation or with you.

734
00:40:26,702 --> 00:40:30,403
But we must insist you turn over
Dr. Bashir and Chief O'Brien.

735
00:40:30,443 --> 00:40:32,106
Why?
So you can murder them?

736
00:40:32,147 --> 00:40:34,049
Unfortunately, Commander,
your officers

737
00:40:34,084 --> 00:40:36,612
are the only two people left
who have seen the data

738
00:40:36,656 --> 00:40:38,854
concerning the development
of the harvesters.

739
00:40:38,962 --> 00:40:41,229
They have no intention
of using that information.

740
00:40:41,267 --> 00:40:42,531
You have my word.

741
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,700
Their intentions are irrelevant.

742
00:40:44,741 --> 00:40:48,112
The fact is, the threat remains
as long as the knowledge exists.

743
00:40:48,148 --> 00:40:49,777
Commander, I know this
is painful for you.

744
00:40:49,819 --> 00:40:51,288
It wasn't easy for us

745
00:40:51,322 --> 00:40:53,623
to order the deaths
of our own people

746
00:40:53,661 --> 00:40:55,096
but it is necessary.

747
00:40:55,131 --> 00:40:57,033
And if I refuse
to turn them over?

748
00:40:57,068 --> 00:40:59,733
You can't outrun us,
and you can't fight us.

749
00:40:59,774 --> 00:41:02,371
We can destroy your runabout
at any time.

750
00:41:02,413 --> 00:41:04,941
Lieutenant Dax and I have
no knowledge of the harvesters.

751
00:41:04,985 --> 00:41:06,420
Are you willing to kill us, too?

752
00:41:06,455 --> 00:41:09,519
We'll do whatever we have to do
to ensure our safety.

753
00:41:09,563 --> 00:41:11,260
Commander,
you are running out of options.

754
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,529
You have one minute

755
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,871
to turn over Dr. Bashir
and Chief O'Brien.

756
00:41:14,974 --> 00:41:16,273
You want them?

757
00:41:16,311 --> 00:41:19,682
You're going to have
to take us all.

758
00:41:19,718 --> 00:41:21,517
He leaves us no choice.

759
00:41:21,555 --> 00:41:22,888
The runabout is turning.

760
00:41:22,992 --> 00:41:25,088
It's heading back
in our direction.

761
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,690
Full stop.

762
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:30,101
He's preparing to fire.

763
00:41:30,141 --> 00:41:31,234
Employ shields.

764
00:41:31,277 --> 00:41:33,270
Shields employed.

765
00:41:33,314 --> 00:41:35,410
Put the runabout on screen.

766
00:41:37,557 --> 00:41:39,618
He must know his phasers
can't hurt us.

767
00:41:42,234 --> 00:41:44,865
He's aiming his vessel
straight for us.

768
00:41:44,906 --> 00:41:46,876
The man must be crazy.

769
00:41:46,911 --> 00:41:49,007
Fire phasers.

770
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,127
It's over.

771
00:42:01,911 --> 00:42:03,540
Head back to T'Lani III.

772
00:42:03,581 --> 00:42:06,246
Prepare to take
the other runabout in tow.

773
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:09,855
Ambassador...

774
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:12,731
sensors indicate
the other runabout

775
00:42:12,768 --> 00:42:15,171
is no longer in orbit.

776
00:42:15,207 --> 00:42:16,870
Well, then, where is it?

777
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:18,072
I don't know.

778
00:42:18,113 --> 00:42:19,342
It's gone.

779
00:42:19,383 --> 00:42:21,444
It can't just have disappeared.

780
00:42:21,487 --> 00:42:23,958
I'm picking up a warp signature.

781
00:42:24,026 --> 00:42:26,053
Sisko.

782
00:42:27,935 --> 00:42:30,702
Maybe he and the others weren't
on that runabout we destroyed.

783
00:42:30,741 --> 00:42:32,974
They could have transported
to the other runabout

784
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:34,446
while our sensors were down.

785
00:42:34,483 --> 00:42:37,888
And then piloted the first ship
by remote navigation.

786
00:42:39,259 --> 00:42:41,126
But we saw them die.

787
00:42:42,934 --> 00:42:44,163
Did we?

788
00:42:50,384 --> 00:42:51,477
What's this?

789
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,012
Something Molly made for you.

790
00:42:53,056 --> 00:42:55,220
She painted it herself.

791
00:42:55,262 --> 00:42:56,822
Oh, it's lovely.

792
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,858
She has real talent.

793
00:42:58,903 --> 00:42:59,996
How's my patient?

794
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:01,905
Better.
Can I go home now?

795
00:43:01,943 --> 00:43:04,244
You should be out of here
by tomorrow.

796
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:05,978
I just wanted to let you know

797
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:09,892
how much I appreciated what
you said back on T'Lani III.

798
00:43:09,927 --> 00:43:11,760
What did I say?

799
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:14,234
That it was an honor
serving with me.

800
00:43:15,506 --> 00:43:16,701
Oh... right.

801
00:43:16,741 --> 00:43:19,805
And I'd like to return
the compliment, if I may.

802
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:22,913
It's been an honor
serving with you, too, Chief.

803
00:43:24,526 --> 00:43:26,018
You know, Mrs. O'Brien, they say

804
00:43:26,096 --> 00:43:29,035
that when two people face death
together, it creates a bond

805
00:43:29,102 --> 00:43:30,366
that cannot be broken.

806
00:43:30,405 --> 00:43:32,204
I never believed that
until I went...

807
00:43:32,243 --> 00:43:33,268
Julian...

808
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:34,678
Hmm?

809
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,353
Oh.

810
00:43:38,389 --> 00:43:40,860
Um, of course
you'd like to be alone.

811
00:43:40,895 --> 00:43:42,090
I understand.

812
00:43:49,581 --> 00:43:51,779
Miles, he saved
your life, you know.

813
00:43:51,818 --> 00:43:54,381
Mmm. He's never going
to let me forget it.

814
00:43:54,425 --> 00:43:55,620
So, what was it like

815
00:43:55,661 --> 00:43:57,996
spending all that time
alone with him?

816
00:43:58,033 --> 00:43:59,058
It was hell.

817
00:43:59,101 --> 00:44:00,798
You can see for yourself.

818
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:02,831
The man never stops talking.

819
00:44:04,046 --> 00:44:07,953
You know, I wouldn't mind
a cup of coffee right now.

820
00:44:07,988 --> 00:44:11,189
Miles, you never drink coffee
in the afternoon.

821
00:44:11,228 --> 00:44:12,423
Well, sure I do.

822
00:44:12,464 --> 00:44:14,018
You do?
