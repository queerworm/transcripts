1
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,092
<i>Peldor joi,</i> Emissary.

2
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:10,845
<i>Peldor joi</i>
to you, too.

3
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:12,429
(<i> laughing</i> )

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:15,474
Well, it looks like the festival
was a big success.

5
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,309
Oh, everyone
seemed to enjoy it.

6
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:20,103
Thank you, Captain.
For what?

7
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,063
For insisting that the
festival take place

8
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:24,608
in spite of the fact that
we're in the middle of a war.

9
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,193
Well, war or no war,

10
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,195
we have a lot
to be grateful for

11
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,071
and we must remember that.

12
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:31,907
Yes, we must.

13
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,909
Shouldn't you be heading
over to the Wardroom

14
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,118
for the ceremony?

15
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,328
On my way.

16
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,371
Let's go.

17
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,539
Come on, you guys.

18
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,248
(<i> children laughing</i> )

19
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:41,249
Mommy, look!

20
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,501
Isn't it pretty?

21
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:44,085
Captain.

22
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,464
Nerys, I've been
looking for you.

23
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,966
Yeah, well, I really
don't feel

24
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,467
like talking
to you right now.

25
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,219
Don't you want to hear
my side of the story?

26
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,345
No.

27
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:54,680
Well, someone has
to maintain order

28
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,931
on the Promenade.

29
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:57,474
You arrested a vedek.

30
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,852
I'd hardly call it an arrest.

31
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:02,103
He wasn't in the holding
cell for more than an hour.

32
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,146
Besides, he broke the law.

33
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,024
Fund-raising
on the Promenade

34
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,026
without a license
is strictly forbidden.

35
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:09,069
Station Regulation
1526, paragraph 7--

36
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,321
Vedek Solis was
raising funds

37
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,407
for Bajoran
flood victims.

38
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,950
A very worthy cause.

39
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,118
Nevertheless, station
regulations are quite clear--

40
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,873
I don't care about
station regulations.

41
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:22,165
(<i> clears throat</i> )

42
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,419
Is-is-is that the Orb
of Contemplation?

43
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,170
Good-bye, Odo.

44
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,136
To Captain Benjamin
Lafayette Sisko

45
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:38,057
in recognition of your
remarkable leadership

46
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:41,142
and meritorious conduct
against the enemy

47
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:44,063
and in particular, for
personal acts of bravery

48
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:47,066
displayed during the battle
to retake Deep Space 9,

49
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:49,985
Starfleet Command is
proud to present you

50
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,988
the Christopher Pike
Medal of Valor.

51
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,489
Congratulations, Ben.

52
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,157
Thank you, Admiral.

53
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,452
And to think I knew him
when he was just a callow youth.

54
00:01:58,452 --> 00:01:59,578
Oh, I bet even then

55
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,413
he showed signs
of greatness.

56
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:02,581
I'm proud of you, Dad.

57
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,500
Now if you would
all excuse us,

58
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,920
I'd like a few words
with the Captain.

59
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,299
(<i> door opens</i> )

60
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:15,010
(<i> door closes</i> )

61
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,219
Good news, Ben.

62
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,013
Starfleet Command
has decided

63
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:20,432
we've been waging
a defensive war long enough.

64
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,267
They figure we're never
going to win this thing

65
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,727
unless we take the fight
into Dominion territory.

66
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,896
No, I know, I know
you've been saying that

67
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,272
since the Romulans

68
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,190
opened a second front
with the Dominion.

69
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,735
Well, it took a while

70
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,570
but your message
finally got through.

71
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,363
Well, when do we go?

72
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,740
That all depends on you.

73
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,699
Me?

74
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,242
That's right, Ben.

75
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,120
Starfleet has chosen you

76
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,664
to plan the invasion
of Cardassia.

77
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,207
BASHIR:
Oh,<i> finally.</i>

78
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,084
I've been waiting
20 minutes for you two

79
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,501
to get out
of that holosuite.

80
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,295
I'm sorry, Julian.
We lost track of time.

81
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,588
Doing what?

82
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:59,507
You were supposed
to be up there exercising.

83
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,342
I don't see any sweat.

84
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,343
Where are all the bruises?

85
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,511
The-the, the broken bones

86
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,180
the blood?
We were talking.

87
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,099
For an hour
and 45 minutes?

88
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,853
It is a private matter.

89
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:15,065
We're thinking
about having a baby.

90
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:18,193
It<i> was</i> a private matter.

91
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,695
<i>Kira to Worf.</i>
<i>Report to Ops immediately.</i>

92
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,572
WORF:
Acknowledged.

93
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,496
(<i> sighs</i> )

94
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,790
Well, you two are awfully quiet.

95
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,294
Uh, look, um,
I-I-I don't want

96
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:36,670
to dampen your
spirits, Jadzia

97
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,546
but I told you before
you were married

98
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,841
that from a medical
point of view,

99
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,425
it wouldn't be easy
for a Trill

100
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,303
and a Klingon
to have a child.

101
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,888
And I'm worried
the kid'll end up
looking like his father.

102
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,308
Well, I hope she does.

103
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:50,600
(<i> sniffs</i> )

104
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,522
A baby?

105
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,524
It's bad enough she married
that Klingon psychopath.

106
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,650
A baby?

107
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,401
Do you have any idea
what that means?

108
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,654
That their marriage
is going to last

109
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,948
a lot longer
than we thought.

110
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:12,289
SISKO:
Five squadrons
of Jem'Hadar attack ships.

111
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,041
At the moment, that's
the entire Dominion fleet

112
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,501
protecting
the Chin'toka system.

113
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,297
Only five squadrons.

114
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,465
It appears you've
found the weak spot

115
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,967
we've been
looking for.

116
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,468
Now, all we have to do

117
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,637
is to convince
the Romulans to join us.

118
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,515
(<i> skeptical growl</i> )

119
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,768
That will not be an easy task.

120
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:37,522
They're an arrogant
and untrustworthy people.

121
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,399
Without their help, we have
little chance of success.

122
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,569
We<i> will</i> succeed!

123
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,945
Mark my words.

124
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,906
By this time next year,

125
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,449
the three of us
will drink bloodwine

126
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,619
in the halls of Cardassia's
Central Command.

127
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,044
You're worrying over nothing.
Am I?

128
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,880
It's a mistake to underestimate
our enemy, Damar.

129
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,924
You're spreading
our forces too thinly.

130
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:07,386
Until we find a way
to bring reinforcements
from the Gamma Quadrant

131
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:08,678
we have to make do
with what we have.

132
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,971
Besides, we
needed new ships

133
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,848
on the Romulan front,
so I sent them.

134
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:16,436
And in doing so
you left the Chin'toka
system vulnerable.

135
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,022
Not as vulnerable
as you think.

136
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,858
We don't need starships
to protect Chin'toka.

137
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,068
Not anymore.

138
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:29,490
These are our new, unmanned,
orbital weapon platforms.

139
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,992
Their hulls are protected
by regenerative

140
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,412
force fields,
and their arsenals consist

141
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,622
of a thousand
plasma torpedoes.

142
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:36,623
I like them.

143
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,874
I thought you would.

144
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,543
I've already ordered
their deployment.

145
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,755
Legate Damar, excuse
the interruption

146
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:44,839
but we have
a problem.

147
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,925
What kind of a problem?

148
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,594
Me.

149
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:56,393
Well, isn't anyone
going to welcome me home?

150
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,896
Heroes get welcomed home, Dukat,
not failures,

151
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,482
or have you forgotten
that under your leadership

152
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,859
the Dominion
nearly lost this war?

153
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,486
As I recall, Weyoun,

154
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,738
you were standing
right by my side

155
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,074
agreeing with every decision
I made.

156
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,160
If you're here because of what
happened to your daughter--

157
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,286
Damar...

158
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,789
you disappoint me.

159
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,541
I would have thought you,
of all people

160
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,837
would be glad
to see your old mentor.

161
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:27,590
I don't hold you responsible
for Ziyal's death.

162
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,592
You may have
fired the phaser

163
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:33,430
but it was Benjamin Sisko
who forced your hand,

164
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,849
and that's why I'm here.

165
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,517
The time has come

166
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:41,646
for me to take my revenge
against the good Captain.

167
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,483
(<i> chuckling</i> )

168
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:47,694
We're in the middle
of a life-and-death struggle

169
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,988
for the control
of the entire Alpha Quadrant

170
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,572
and all you care about

171
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:55,118
is quenching your petty thirst
for revenge.

172
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,787
You haven't changed
a bit, have you?

173
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,957
On the contrary, I'm a new man.

174
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,919
I no longer have a need
for conquest or power.

175
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,507
I'm far beyond all that.

176
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:14,804
I exist in a state
of complete clarity--

177
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:20,394
a clarity I intend to share
with the universe.

178
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,022
You're right, Dukat,
you have changed.

179
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:27,775
You've gone from being
a self-important egotist

180
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,111
to a self-deluded madman.

181
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,572
I hardly call that
an improvement.

182
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,034
I don't have<i> time</i> for this.

183
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:36,993
Remove him.

184
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,286
DAMAR:
Wait.

185
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,622
Why did you come?

186
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,708
Isn't that obvious?

187
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,754
To give you what you desire
above all else--

188
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,423
the Alpha Quadrant.

189
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:50,924
(<i> chuckles</i> )

190
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,175
All I need

191
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,553
is a certain Bajoran artifact--

192
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:58,098
one of the many
the Cardassians appropriated

193
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,891
during the occupation.

194
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:03,144
And how is this artifact
going to help us?

195
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,106
Let's just say,
it will make it possible

196
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:09,901
for Dominion reinforcements
to come through that wormhole

197
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:14,489
and destroy
Captain Benjamin Sisko

198
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:19,327
and the Federation,
once and for all.

199
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,969
Really, Captain
I see no reason why
I should sit here

200
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,721
and allow this
Klingon jackal

201
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,014
to call me a coward.

202
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:43,560
Apparently, this "jackal"
has more courage

203
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,728
than the entire
Romulan Senate.

204
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,813
There, you see my point?

205
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,022
WORF:
General,
you must

206
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,065
try to remain calm.

207
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,776
This is not
the time for calm.

208
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,613
It's time to strike the enemy
and strike them hard!

209
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:55,738
We have found
their weak point.

210
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,698
Now we need
to exploit it.

211
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,160
But this<i> p'tagh</i>
would rather sit home

212
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,286
and count his dead.

213
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,538
If we invade Cardassia now,

214
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:06,333
all we'll do is count our dead.

215
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,459
Gentlemen, please.

216
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,294
We're allies, remember that.

217
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:13,047
What good is an ally
who'll stab you in the back?

218
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,674
Notice the primitive rage
in his eye,

219
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,760
the uncontrolled brutality?

220
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,013
Klingons can be
quite entertaining

221
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,306
can't they?

222
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,392
Every Romulan zoo
should have a pair.

223
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,477
(<i> growls</i> )

224
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,312
Sit down, General!

225
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:33,318
Save your anger
for the Dominion.

226
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,371
Senator...

227
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,207
you've studied
our invasion plans.

228
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,833
Yes, I have,

229
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,671
and I continue
to find them premature.

230
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:56,341
Let the Dominion continue
to send its fleets against us

231
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,260
and we will annihilate them
one by one.

232
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,512
ROSS:
And they'll continue

233
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,639
to rebuild their ships
and send more.

234
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,309
The Dominion breed Jem'Hadar
faster than we can destroy them.

235
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,603
The only way to achieve
a lasting victory

236
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:11,606
is to demolish their shipyards,

237
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,359
their weapons plants,

238
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,320
to force them to retreat
deeper and deeper

239
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,113
into their own territory

240
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,658
until our ships
can surround their headquarters

241
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,243
on Cardassia Prime

242
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,705
and they will have no choice
but to surrender.

243
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,792
I know it won't be easy.

244
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:36,172
I know that we will pay
a heavy price

245
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,426
for every system
we take from them,

246
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,801
but in the end,

247
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,345
that's the only way

248
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,556
to drive the Dominion
out of the Alpha Quadrant

249
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:47,350
and<i> that</i> is the goal
we all share!

250
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,728
Klingons, humans...

251
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,689

That was great, Vic.

277
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,622
It's not one of the most

Ah, it's a long story, friend.

A very smart one.

It's simple.

286
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,766
You take one beautiful,
happily married filly,

287
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:54,394
add the possibility
of her giving birth to a foal,

288
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,353

It's time to move on

It's tough to lose
a woman like Dax.

I hate to break
it to you, pally

296
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:11,786
but you lost her
a long time ago.

297
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:12,829
You both did.

298
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,914
But lucky for you, space is big.

to depress the band.

Well, thanks, Vic.

00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,611
We appreciate the advice.

Well, that may be true,
but you're not going, Jake.

320
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:13,514
But, Dad, we're talking about
the invasion of Cardassia--

321
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,475
a savage thrust
into the very heart

322
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,976
of the Dominion.

323
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,771
Well, I mean, that's not
how I would write it.

324
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:22,649
That's a relief,
but you're still not going, son.

325
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,694
I have to go.
It's my job.

326
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,447
Now, if you don't want
me on the<i> Defiant,</i> fine.

327
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,449
I'll go
with General Martok.

328
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:34,994
Hey, get the story
from a Klingon perspective.

329
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:41,125
All right, Jake,
the<i> Defiant</i> it is.

330
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,795
So, when<i> do</i> we leave?

331
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:46,506
Just keep your bags packed.

332
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,007
Yes, sir.

333
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,561
Don't worry, Dad.

334
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,229
We'll watch out
for each other.

00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:13,574
The Sisko is of Bajor.

337
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,286
It is where he belongs.

338
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,831
It is where he
is meant to be.

339

Are you telling me
not to go to Cardassia?

340
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,420
The Sisko is of Bajor.

341
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,383
It is dangerous
to walk a different path.

342
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,343
Dangerous? In what way?

343
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:36,430
The Sisko must
not leave the
chosen path.

344
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,099
The Sisko is of Bajor.

345
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,101
It is where he belongs.

346
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:44,022
Why is it
dangerous
to leave?

347
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:47,608
And how will it
affect Bajor?

348
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,652
You have to tell me.

349
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:07,879
The Cardassians call them
orbital weapon platforms.

350
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,213

indicate

351
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,757

placed hundreds of them

throughout
the Chin'toka system.

353

Are they operational?

No, not yet.

How much time

355
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:17,680
do we have
before they are?

Two, maybe three days.

357
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:21,559
So, it would appear
that your weak spot

358
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,644
is about to become
much stronger.

359
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,146
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
Leave it to a Romulan

360
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,148
to run at the first sign
of trouble.

361
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,483
SENATOR:
And leave it

362
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,612
to a Klingon to leap
to the wrong conclusion.

363
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,196
The Romulan Empire

364
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,574
has agreed to join
the invasion of Cardassia,

365
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:40,536
and we live up
to our agreements.

366
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,414
The only question is:
Can the invasion

367
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:46,208
be launched before
the defensive grid is activated?

368
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,920
We'll have to leave
first thing in the morning.

369
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,463
ROSS:
Then it's settled.

370
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,505
Good luck, gentlemen.

371
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,758
Good luck to all of us.

372
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:57,095
Romulans don't believe in luck.

373
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:58,304
All the better!

374
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:02,558
It leaves more
for the rest of us.

375
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,394
(<i> door opens</i> )

376
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,896
You've been, uh, quiet, Ben.

377
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,482
Those weapon platforms
have you worried?

378
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,484
It's not about that, sir.

379
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,321
It's about the Prophets.

380
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,364
The wormhole aliens--

381
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,158
they spoke to me last night.

382
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,662
I hope they gave
the mission their blessing.

383
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:26,165
They told me not
to go to Cardassia.

384
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,084
That I should stay here.

385
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,336
Did they give you a reason?

386
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,005
Nothing concrete.

387
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,882
Just that it's too dangerous.

388
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:35,967
In what way?

389
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,844
Dangerous to you?
To the mission?

390
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:38,886
To Bajor?

391
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,680
I'm not sure.

392
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,016
What is it
you're telling me, Ben?

393
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,267
You want permission
to stay behind?

394
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,978
It's not about what<i> I</i> want.

395
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:49,563
It's about what
the Prophets want.

396
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,898
That's not
a good enough answer--

397
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,900
not from
a Starfleet Captain.

398
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,654
The Prophets don't see me
as a Starfleet Captain.

399
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,823
They see me as their Emissary.

400
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,658
That's the problem, isn't it?

401
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:03,661
For the past six years,
you've tried to be both,

402
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:04,912
and up to now,
I've been patient.

403
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:05,997
I've indulged you.

404
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,874
I've gone out on
a limb for you

405
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,249
many times,
but this is it.

406
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,793
You've got to make
a decision.

407
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,713
You are either the Emissary
or a Starfleet Captain.

408
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,966
You can't be both.

409
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,681
I'll...

410
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:32,272
I'll be on the<i> Defiant</i> bridge
at 0500.

411
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,822
The combined fleet
at Deep Space 9?

412
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,992
Composed of Federation,
Klingon and Romulan ships.

413
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,244
You think they'll head
for the Chin'toka system?

414
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,537
I would.

415
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:49,123
Well, then
we have nothing
to worry about.

416
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:53,044
The weapon platforms
will be operational
in time to greet them.

417
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,670
That's a very
comforting thought

418
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,963
if it's accurate.

419
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,090
I'll make sure
that it is.

420
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,591
(<i> door opens</i> )

421
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:03,096
Gentlemen, I hope
I'm not interrupting.

422
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,680
What is it now, Dukat?

423
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,015
I've found it.

424
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,474
Behold...

425
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,769
the key to victory.

426
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,648
Oh, I see you remain skeptical.

427
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,860
Well, you won't be for long.

428
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,864
Over the past few months,
I've immersed myself

429
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:25,409
in the study
of the Bajoran ancient texts

430
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,829
and I've come to realize
that the wormhole

431
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:32,959
is much more than the gateway
to the Gamma Quadrant.

432
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,796
It's the Temple of the Prophets.

433
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:41,842
It's from there
that they smile
benevolently down on Bajor.

434
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,886
It's from there

435
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:48,141
that they protect that world
and its people.

436
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,184
The sad truth is,

437
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:54,188
we wasted our time
fighting the Bajorans

438
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:58,276
when we should have been
fighting their gods.

439
00:21:58,276 --> 00:22:00,987
How do you fight a god?

440
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,113
DUKAT:
I'll show you.

441
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,489
You see...

442
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:08,119
we have an ally
we never knew we had.

443
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,579
You may want to step back.

444
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,791
(<i> chanting</i> ):
<i>Dorrah</i>

445
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:17,170
<i>tolka betri...</i>

446
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,879
<i>pah'rahn</i>

447
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,589
<i>meedor.</i>

448
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:26,846
<i>Dorrah tolka... ullkess</i>

449
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:30,016
<i>pah'rahn!</i>

450
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,350
(<i> grunts</i> )

451
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,228
DAMAR:
Dukat!

452
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,863
(<i> voice reverberating</i> ):
Your concern is touching...

453
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,781
but unnecessary.

454
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,124
Busy?

455
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:59,128
Uh... a little.

456
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:00,754
Well, I'm leaving
with the task force

457
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,131
first thing
in the morning.

458
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:03,257
I heard.

459
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:05,634
And?

460
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,886
And...

461
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,012
I'm sorry I arrested him.

462
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,180
I was simply

463
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,140
trying to do my duty,
but I can see

464
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,726
how it might have
seemed excessive.

465
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,728
What are you talking about?

466
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,313
Vedek Solis.

467
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:18,564
That's why you're here,
isn't it?

468
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,066
No...

469
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,318
but now I know
why you've been avoiding me

470
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:23,694
for the past few days.

471
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,529
I haven't been avoiding you.

472
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:29,242
I've been helping<i> you</i>
to avoid<i> me.</i>

473
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:30,910
Why would I want to do that?

474
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:35,164
Because... you don't want us
to be together anymore?

475
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:37,875
Is that what you've
been thinking?

476
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:43,089
Odo, we had an argument.

477
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,965
People have them
all the time.

478
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,508
Look at Dax and Worf.

479
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,552
They love each other, but
they fight all the time.

480
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,803
Are you saying
that you love me?

481
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:50,846
Don't change
the subject.

482
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:51,931
Which is?

483
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,724
I don't even
know anymore.

484
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:55,935
But you're no longer angry
with me?

485
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,979
No, but you were wrong
to arrest the vedek.

486
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,856
I see.
And I thought

487
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,276
that we could spend my last
night on the station together.

488
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,695
That's a wonderful idea.

489
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,365
Then I will
see you later.

490
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:12,118
I look forward to that.

491
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,869
Good.

492
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,547
You know, Nerys...

493
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:31,637
observing humanoid relationships
and being in one...

494
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:34,890
are very different things.

495
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,934
Like night and day.

496
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,231
If you ask me, it's an
ungodly hour to go to war.

497
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,481
You can quote me on that.

498
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:44,442
I will.

499
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:45,818
Oh, Jadzia, will
you look in

500
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,361
on Keiko and the kids
while I'm gone?

501
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,612
You can count on it.

502
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,864
And try to keep
Julian out of trouble.

503
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,158
Now, that's pushing.

504
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,077
It's your station,
old man.

505
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,412
I'll take
good care of her.

506
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,291
Give my best
to the Jem'Hadar.

507
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,708
Oh, I'll do that.

508
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,669
I said a prayer
at the shrine last night

509
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:04,795
for the two of you.

510
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,088
About having a baby?

511
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,799
The Prophets can be
helpful in such matters.

512
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,426
I hope they're listening.

513
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:14,763
Did you hear that?

514
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,349
We have the Prophets
on our side.

515
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,142
According to Dr. Bashir

516
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:19,977
we need all the
help we can get.

517
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,770
Just remember
when you get back,

518
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,189
we have a lot of work to do.

519
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:26,900
I don't consider
that work.

520
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,821
Wish I was
going with you.

521
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:32,990
You are...

522
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,159
in here.

523
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:38,454
I love it
when you get romantic.

524
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:58,974
Captain on the Bridge!

525
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,226
SISKO:
As you were.

526
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:02,769
You got
here early.

527
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,022
GARAK:
This is a momentous
occasion.

528
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:08,650
It's not every day
I embark on a journey
to liberate my homeworld.

529
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,985
That's one way to put it.

530
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,905
<i>This is General Martok</i>
<i>to all ships.</i>

531
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,198
<i>Assume tactical formation.</i>

532
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:16,075
<i>We are moving out.</i>

533
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,202
Take us to Cardassia,
Mr. Nog.

534
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,370
Aye, sir.

535
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:31,424
The enemy fleet
is approaching

536
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:32,799
the Chin'toka system.

537
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,344
What's the status
of our weapon platforms?

538
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:38,805
Still off line.

539
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:43,018
It pains me to say this
but you Cardassians are proving
to be quite a disappointment.

540
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,439
I'll remind you
that you said that.

541
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,663
Looks like we're in luck,
Captain.

542
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,749
The defensive grid's
still off line.

543
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,376
Jem'Hadar fighters approaching.

544
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:10,212
Bearing 059 mark 031.

545
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,089
They must know
they don't stand a chance

546
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,673
against a fleet this size.

547
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,427
That will not matter
to the Jem'Hadar.

548
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:19,388
Sit down, Jake.

549
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,515
Right.

550
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,810
<i>Martok to Sisko.</i>
Go ahead.

551
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,687
<i>My attack wing is closest</i>
<i>to those Jem'Hadar fighters.</i>

552
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,273
<i>Preparing to engage.</i>

553
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:30,899
Good luck, General.

554
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,962
I always thought
the Jem'Hadar were crazy.

555
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:54,047
There's method
to their madness.

556
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:57,009
They're inflicting considerable
damage on the Klingons.

557
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:00,012
And buying time to get their
weapon platforms operational.

558
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,721
Sisko to Martok.

559
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,724
<i>The Jem'Hadar have managed</i>
<i>to cripple or destroy</i>

560
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,310
<i>15 of my ships.</i>

561
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,978
Do you need any assistance?

562
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:09,313
<i>That won't be necessary.</i>

563
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:12,232
<i>Commence firing</i>
<i>on the weapon platforms.</i>

564
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,980
I believe you owe
me an apology.

565
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,273
I believe you're right.

566
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,858
Now, if Dukat can get

567
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,485
our reinforcements
through the wormhole--

568
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:59,446
I'm not sure how much faith
I have in this...

569
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,489
What did he call it?

570
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,032
Pah-wraith.

571
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:04,660
Pah-wraiths and Prophets?

572
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,328
All this talk
of gods strikes me

573
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:10,040
as nothing more than
superstitious nonsense.

574
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,918
You believe that the Founders
are gods, don't you?

575
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:13,960
That's different.

576
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,379
(<i> laughing</i> ):
In what way?

577
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:16,963
The Founders<i> are</i> Gods.

578
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,633
(<i> sighs</i> )

579
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,480
WORF:
We are unable
to penetrate their force fields.

580
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,068
GARAK: Captain, I've just noted
something odd about
those platforms.

581
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:41,071
Well, don't keep it to yourself,
Mr. Garak.

582
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:44,575
Not one of them seems to have
a power generator on board.

583
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:45,867
O'BRIEN:
He's right.

584
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,077
Each one seems to be
getting its power

585
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:48,412
from a central source.

586
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:50,956
We got to find that source
and destroy it.

587
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,165
Chief?

588
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,333
I'm on it.

589
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:02,301
According to the DNA
scans I did this morning

590
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,386
the ovarian resequencing
enzymes I gave you

591
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,096
appear to be working.

592
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:07,180
You mean, Worf and I
can have a baby?

593
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,099
It certainly
looks that way.

594
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:11,810
I must say, I didn't expect
such positive results so early.

595
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,312
It's quite amazing, actually.

596
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,147
Oh, thank you, Julian!

597
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,816
It's all part
of being a doctor.

598
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,234
Oh, no, it's more
than that.

599
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,945
You're a good friend--
you always have been.

600
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,322
And I always will be.

601
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,827
(<i> sighing</i> ):
I'd better
get back to work.

602
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,705
But first I'm going to stop by
the Bajoran shrine.

603
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:33,165
What for?

604
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,751
Kira said a prayer
for me and Worf last night.

605
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,877
She told the Prophets how much
we wanted a baby.

606
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:39,171
Well, I'd say
they've been listening.

607
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:42,382
That is, if you believe
in the Prophets.

608
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,176
Oh, well, I do today.

609
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,552
(<i> laughing</i> )

610
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:03,403
(<i> nervous sigh</i> )

611
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,447
I'm not sure
if I'm doing this correctly.

612
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:08,659
I... I don't come here a lot.

613
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,537
And to be perfectly honest,

614
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:15,332
I feel more comfortable thinking
of you as wormhole aliens

615
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:17,083
but, um...

616
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:21,296
Kira believes
you're much more than that.

617
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,590
Maybe she's right.

618
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,800
I don't know.

619
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,426
(<i> sighing</i> )

620
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:30,472
But if you<i> are</i> Prophets
and you're listening,

621
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,182
I just want to say...

622
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,351
(<i> air whooshing</i> )

623
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:40,649
Dukat.

624
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,201
(<i> gasping</i> )

625
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,063
(<i> screaming</i> )

626
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:26,278
(<i> panting</i> )

627
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,544
Dad, what is it?

628
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:43,670
Captain!

629
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,926
I'm not sure.

630
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:51,720
I think I felt
the Prophets

631
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,930
reaching out to me.

632
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:56,182
Something's wrong.

633
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,519
O'BRIEN:
Sir, I found it.

634
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,648
There's a subspace
power generator
on a small moon

635
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,650
orbiting the far planet.

636
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,778
It's transmitting energy
to the weapon platforms.

637
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:09,112
Captain?

638
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,448
Take us there, Mr. Nog.

639
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:12,449
Aye, sir.

640
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:13,992
Get him back
to his quarters.

641
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,034
Don't worry, Captain.

642
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,328
We'll get
the job done.

643
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,638
I know this is small comfort,

644
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:38,809
but I never intended<i> you</i>
any harm.

645
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:07,295
Approaching the target.

646
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,797
On screen.

647
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,220
Target locked.

648
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,680
Fire.

649
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,773
We are unable to penetrate
the moon's

650
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:27,983
defensive grid.

651
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:30,819
Sir, I have an idea.

652
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,362
Go ahead.

653
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:35,574
Maybe<i> we</i> can't destroy
that power generator,

654
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,951
but I bet
those weapon platforms could.

655
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:41,246
Why would they fire
on their own power source?

656
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,498
We'd have to fool
the platform's

657
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,958
targeting systems

658
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,793
into thinking
the generator's an enemy ship.

659
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:49,629
We can use our deflector array
to imprint a Federation

660
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,841
warp signature on the
generator's energy matrix.

661
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:55,427
It is worth a try.

662
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:03,018
Evasive maneuvers, Mr. Nog.

663
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:04,895
Pattern theta.

664
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,611
Induction stabilizers set.

665
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,654
Booster modulators
synchronized.

666
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,865
Ready to activate deflector.

667
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,575
Do it.

668
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,424
Yes!

669
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:37,719
We did it.

670
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,072
<i>Martok to</i> Defiant.

671
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,031
Go ahead, General.

672
00:35:58,031 --> 00:35:59,491
<i>Well done, Major.</i>

673
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,451
<i>We will begin</i>
<i>transporting ground troops</i>

674
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,912
<i>to both planets immediately.</i>

675
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,125
O'BRIEN:
Major, we're receiving
a priority one

676
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:10,085
transmission from Deep Space 9.

677
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:11,962
It's from Julian.

678
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:18,802
This is a disaster.

679
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:21,638
Federation soldiers
have landed on Cardassian soil

680
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:24,474
and now you're telling me
the wormhole is<i> gone?</i>

681
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:28,145
And with it, any chance
of getting reinforcements
from the Gamma Quadrant.

682
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:30,480
<i>I'm well aware</i>
<i>things didn't turn out</i>

683
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,815
<i>quite the way I planned,</i>

684
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,859
<i>but I assure you,</i>
<i>we still achieved</i>

685
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,694
<i>a great victory.</i>

686
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,779
Forgive me if I don't
share your euphoria.

687
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,447
<i>Well, you should.</i>

688
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:43,910
<i>The Bajoran people have been</i>
<i>cut off from their Gods,</i>

689
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,911
<i>perhaps forever.</i>

690
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,663
How does that help us?

691
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:50,375
<i>Because Sisko has been cut off</i>
<i>from the Prophets as well,</i>

692
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,793
<i>and without the Prophets,</i>

693
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,963
<i>he's just another</i>
<i>Starfleet Captain.</i>

694
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,882
And that's supposed
to make me feel better?

695
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,925
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
<i>Oh...</i>

696
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:02,804
<i>believe me... it will.</i>

697
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,859
(<i> agitated conversation</i> )

698
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,819
Emissary,
Emissary.

699
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:20,113
(<i> all talking</i> )

700
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,326
GIRL:
Emissary!

701
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,537
My mother says all
the Orbs are dark,

702
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,831
that the Prophets
have abandoned us.

703
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,750
You have to find
them, Emissary.

704
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,211
You have to ask them
to come back.

705
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,801
I will try.

706
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,872
I managed to save
the Dax symbiont.

707
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:14,667
We have to get it to Trill
as soon as possible.

708
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,588
There was, um...

709
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,882
nothing I could
do for Jadzia.

710
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:34,646
(<i> softly</i> ):
I'm... I'm sorry.

711
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,277
Save your strength.

712
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:54,582
Our baby...

713
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:58,044
would have been
so beautiful.

714
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:20,150
(<i> roaring</i> )

715
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:35,290
<i>neH taH Qo'noS.</i>

716
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:39,961
<i>Hegh bat'lhqu Hoch nej maH.</i>

717
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:43,422
<i>neH taH Qo'noS.</i>

718
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:50,596
<i>yay je bat'lh manob Hegh.</i>

719
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:10,575
The funeral service is due to
begin in a few minutes, Jadzia,

720
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:13,995
but I need to talk to you
one last time.

721
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:17,374
When I first met you,

722
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:21,378
you told me that my relationship
with Jadzia Dax

723
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:23,088
wouldn't be any different

724
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:26,007
than the one I had
with Curzon Dax.

725
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,510
Things didn't work out that way.

726
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:34,640
I had a hell of a lot of fun
with both of you.

727
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:38,353
But Curzon was my mentor.

728
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:43,441
You... you were my friend,

729
00:40:44,401 --> 00:40:46,152
and I am going to miss you.

730
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:51,616
I should've listened
to the Prophets

731
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,452
and not gone to Cardassia.

732
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,747
Then maybe you'd still be alive.

733
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:00,833
Damn it!

734
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,213
Why aren't you still here,
Jadzia?

735
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:08,591
I need you to help me
sort things out.

736
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,635
Something's happened
to the Prophets...

737
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:13,972
something that's made them
turn their backs on Bajor,

738
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,807
and I'm responsible,

739
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,892
and I don't know
what to do about it,

740
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:22,855
how to make... it right again.

741
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,651
I've failed as the Emissary...

742
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,903
and for the first time
in my life,

743
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:32,949
I've failed in my duty
as a Starfleet officer.

744
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,912
I need time to think...

745
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,833
clear my head...

746
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:44,419
but I can't do it here,

747
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,587
not on the station,

748
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,131
not now.

749
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:51,843
I need to get away.

750
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,767
And find a way to figure out
how to make things right again.

751
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:04,022
And I have to make things
right again, Jadzia.

752
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:07,566
I have to.

753
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:20,455
The station's
all yours, Major.

754
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:22,874
She'll be here
when you get back.

755
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,459
This leave of absence
you're taking, sir,

756
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,127
how long do you think
you'll be gone?

757
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:27,837
I don't know exactly.

758
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:29,088
ODO:
We'll be waiting.

759
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,633
Good luck, sir.

760
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,097
Thanks, Chief.

761
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,311
My thanks to all of you.

762
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,235
Let's go home, Jake.

763
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:02,747
Landing Pad C.

764
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,892
(<i> sighs</i> )

765
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:24,936
I was afraid of that.

766
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,397
He's not sure
he's coming back.

767
00:43:27,397 --> 00:43:29,148
What makes you say that?

768
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,067
His baseball--

769
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:32,944
he took it with him.

770
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:57,051
JAKE:
Dad...

771
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,720
Grandpa's ready to close
up the restaurant.

772
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,056
He wants to know when
you're coming in.

773
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:04,850
In a little while.
