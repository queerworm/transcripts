1
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:09,545
<i>Peldor joi,</i> Emissary.

2
00:00:09,581 --> 00:00:11,175
<i>Peldor joi</i> to you, too.

3
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:16,021
Well, it looks like the festival
was a big success.

4
00:00:16,063 --> 00:00:17,760
Oh, everyone seemed to enjoy it.

5
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:19,498
Thank you, Captain.

6
00:00:19,538 --> 00:00:20,528
For what?

7
00:00:20,574 --> 00:00:22,442
For insisting that the festival
take place

8
00:00:22,478 --> 00:00:25,007
in spite of the fact that we're
in the middle of a war.

9
00:00:25,052 --> 00:00:26,521
Well, war or no war

10
00:00:26,555 --> 00:00:28,492
we have a lot to be grateful for

11
00:00:28,527 --> 00:00:30,361
and we must remember that.

12
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,231
Yes, we must.

13
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:34,240
Shouldn't you be heading
over to the Wardroom

14
00:00:34,274 --> 00:00:35,436
for the ceremony?

15
00:00:35,477 --> 00:00:36,673
On my way.

16
00:00:36,713 --> 00:00:37,703
Let's go.

17
00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:39,013
Come on, you guys.

18
00:00:40,622 --> 00:00:41,590
Mommy, look!

19
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:42,923
Isn't it pretty?

20
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:44,260
Captain.

21
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:47,895
Nerys, I've been
looking for you.

22
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,936
Yeah, well, I really don't feel
like talking to you right now.

23
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,780
Don't you want to hear
my side of the story?

24
00:00:52,818 --> 00:00:53,912
No.

25
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:56,289
Well, someone has to maintain
order on the Promenade.

26
00:00:56,327 --> 00:00:57,956
You arrested a vedek.

27
00:00:57,997 --> 00:01:00,264
I'd hardly call it an arrest.

28
00:01:00,302 --> 00:01:02,364
He wasn't in the holding
cell for more than an hour.

29
00:01:02,408 --> 00:01:03,376
Besides, he broke the law.

30
00:01:03,411 --> 00:01:05,382
Fund-raising on the Promenade

31
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:07,386
without a license
is strictly forbidden.

32
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,357
Station Regulation
1526, paragraph 7...

33
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:13,857
Vedek Solis was raising funds
for Bajoran flood victims.

34
00:01:13,902 --> 00:01:15,235
A very worthy cause.

35
00:01:15,272 --> 00:01:17,436
Nevertheless, station
regulations are quite clear.

36
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,812
I don't care about
station regulations.

37
00:01:22,556 --> 00:01:25,826
Is-is-is that the Orb
of Contemplation?

38
00:01:25,864 --> 00:01:27,356
Good-bye, Odo.

39
00:01:33,215 --> 00:01:35,584
To Captain Benjamin
Lafayette Sisko

40
00:01:35,621 --> 00:01:38,458
in recognition
of your remarkable leadership

41
00:01:38,495 --> 00:01:41,525
and meritorious conduct
against the enemy

42
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:44,473
and in particular,
for personal acts of bravery

43
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:47,346
displayed during the battle
to retake Deep Space 9

44
00:01:47,449 --> 00:01:50,320
Starfleet Command
is proud to present you

45
00:01:50,356 --> 00:01:53,329
the Christopher Pike
Medal of Valor.

46
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,128
Congratulations, Ben.

47
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:56,534
Thank you, Admiral.

48
00:01:56,571 --> 00:01:59,135
And to think I knew him
when he was just a callow youth.

49
00:01:59,177 --> 00:02:01,741
Oh, I bet even then,
he showed signs of greatness.

50
00:02:01,783 --> 00:02:02,808
I'm proud of you, Dad.

51
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:05,920
Now if you would all excuse us

52
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,261
I'd like a few words
with the Captain.

53
00:02:15,382 --> 00:02:16,681
Good news, Ben.

54
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,313
Starfleet Command has decided

55
00:02:18,356 --> 00:02:20,920
we've been waging
a defensive war long enough.

56
00:02:20,963 --> 00:02:22,626
They figure we're never
going to win this thing

57
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,295
unless we take the fight
into Dominion territory.

58
00:02:24,338 --> 00:02:26,332
No, I know, I know
you've been saying that

59
00:02:26,376 --> 00:02:29,543
since the Romulans opened a
second front with the Dominion.

60
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,249
Well, it took a while

61
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,987
but your message
finally got through.

62
00:02:34,027 --> 00:02:35,690
Well, when do we go?

63
00:02:35,732 --> 00:02:37,224
That all depends on you.

64
00:02:37,268 --> 00:02:38,236
Me?

65
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,534
That's right, Ben.

66
00:02:39,574 --> 00:02:41,408
Starfleet has chosen you

67
00:02:41,512 --> 00:02:43,983
to plan the invasion
of Cardassia.

68
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,584
Oh, finally.

69
00:04:50,654 --> 00:04:52,591
I've been waiting
20 minutes for you two

70
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,061
to get out of that holosuite.

71
00:04:54,096 --> 00:04:56,033
I'm sorry, Julian.
We lost track of time.

72
00:04:56,068 --> 00:04:57,093
Doing what?

73
00:04:57,136 --> 00:04:59,938
You were supposed to be up there
exercising.

74
00:04:59,977 --> 00:05:01,674
I don't see any sweat.

75
00:05:01,715 --> 00:05:02,705
Where are all the bruises?

76
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,912
The-the, the broken bones

77
00:05:03,953 --> 00:05:05,513
- the blood?
- We were talking.

78
00:05:05,557 --> 00:05:07,494
For an hour and 45 minutes?

79
00:05:09,299 --> 00:05:11,030
It is a private matter.

80
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,511
We're thinking
about having a baby.

81
00:05:14,545 --> 00:05:16,948
It was a private matter.

82
00:05:18,822 --> 00:05:21,293
Kira to Worf.
Report to Ops immediately.

83
00:05:21,328 --> 00:05:22,854
Acknowledged.

84
00:05:29,448 --> 00:05:31,817
Well, you two are awfully quiet.

85
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:37,299
Uh, look, um, I-I-I don't want
to dampen your spirits, Jadzia

86
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,098
but I told you
before you were married

87
00:05:39,137 --> 00:05:40,629
that from a medical
point of view

88
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,871
it wouldn't be easy for a Trill

89
00:05:42,913 --> 00:05:44,747
and a Klingon to have a child.

90
00:05:44,784 --> 00:05:45,752
And I'm worried

91
00:05:45,786 --> 00:05:47,278
the kid'll end up
looking like his father.

92
00:05:48,293 --> 00:05:49,785
Well, I hope she does.

93
00:05:54,441 --> 00:05:55,500
A baby?

94
00:05:55,543 --> 00:05:58,175
It's bad enough she married
that Klingon psychopath.

95
00:05:58,217 --> 00:05:59,185
A baby?

96
00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:00,848
Do you have any idea
what that means?

97
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,123
That their marriage
is going to last

98
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:05,326
a lot longer than we thought.

99
00:06:09,477 --> 00:06:12,644
Five squadrons
of Jem'Hadar attack ships.

100
00:06:12,718 --> 00:06:14,586
At the moment, that's
the entire Dominion fleet

101
00:06:14,623 --> 00:06:16,617
protecting the Chin'toka system.

102
00:06:18,498 --> 00:06:20,765
Only five squadrons.

103
00:06:20,803 --> 00:06:22,899
It appears you've
found the weak spot

104
00:06:22,942 --> 00:06:24,468
we've been looking for.

105
00:06:24,513 --> 00:06:25,914
Now, all we have to do

106
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,217
is to convince
the Romulans to join us.

107
00:06:29,592 --> 00:06:34,400
That will not be an easy task.

108
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:38,002
They're an arrogant
and untrustworthy people.

109
00:06:38,045 --> 00:06:39,708
Without their help, we have
little chance of success.

110
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:42,586
We will succeed!

111
00:06:42,623 --> 00:06:44,526
Mark my words.

112
00:06:44,561 --> 00:06:46,555
By this time next year

113
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:48,968
the three of us
will drink bloodwine

114
00:06:49,005 --> 00:06:51,910
in the halls of Cardassia's
Central Command.

115
00:06:57,592 --> 00:06:58,651
You're worrying over nothing.

116
00:06:58,694 --> 00:06:59,719
Am I?

117
00:06:59,764 --> 00:07:02,794
It's a mistake to underestimate
our enemy, Damar.

118
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:04,638
You're spreading
our forces too thinly.

119
00:07:04,676 --> 00:07:05,701
Until we find a way

120
00:07:05,778 --> 00:07:07,908
to bring reinforcements
from the Gamma Quadrant

121
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,180
we have to make do
with what we have.

122
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,621
Besides, we needed new ships

123
00:07:10,657 --> 00:07:12,560
on the Romulan front,
so I sent them.

124
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:13,723
And in doing so

125
00:07:13,764 --> 00:07:16,828
you left the Chin'toka
system vulnerable.

126
00:07:16,872 --> 00:07:19,504
Not as vulnerable as you think.

127
00:07:19,545 --> 00:07:22,347
We don't need starships
to protect Chin'toka.

128
00:07:22,384 --> 00:07:23,478
Not anymore.

129
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:29,997
These are our new, unmanned,
orbital weapon platforms.

130
00:07:30,036 --> 00:07:31,528
Their hulls are protected
by regenerative

131
00:07:31,573 --> 00:07:33,771
force fields,
and their arsenals consist

132
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:36,077
of a thousand plasma torpedoes.

133
00:07:36,118 --> 00:07:37,246
I like them.

134
00:07:37,287 --> 00:07:38,449
I thought you would.

135
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,859
I've already ordered
their deployment.

136
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:44,401
Legate Damar,
excuse the interruption

137
00:07:44,437 --> 00:07:45,405
but we have a problem.

138
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,343
What kind of a problem?

139
00:07:48,547 --> 00:07:49,914
Me.

140
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:56,831
Well, isn't anyone
going to welcome me home?

141
00:07:56,901 --> 00:08:00,501
Heroes get welcomed home, Dukat,
not failures

142
00:08:00,543 --> 00:08:02,878
or have you forgotten
that under your leadership

143
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:05,352
the Dominion
nearly lost this war?

144
00:08:05,388 --> 00:08:06,948
As I recall, Weyoun

145
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:09,293
you were standing
right by my side

146
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,733
agreeing with every decision
I made.

147
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,707
If you're here because of what
happened to your daughter...

148
00:08:13,741 --> 00:08:14,731
Damar...

149
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:18,416
you disappoint me.

150
00:08:18,453 --> 00:08:21,051
I would have thought you,
of all people

151
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:24,498
would be glad
to see your old mentor.

152
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:28,065
I don't hold you responsible
for Ziyal's death.

153
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,136
You may have fired the phaser

154
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,848
but it was Benjamin Sisko
who forced your hand

155
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:36,726
and that's why I'm here.

156
00:08:36,762 --> 00:08:38,095
The time has come

157
00:08:38,132 --> 00:08:41,817
for me to take my revenge
against the good Captain.

158
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,826
We're in the middle
of a life-and-death struggle

159
00:08:47,865 --> 00:08:50,132
for the control
of the entire Alpha Quadrant

160
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,662
and all you care about

161
00:08:51,707 --> 00:08:55,375
is quenching your petty thirst
for revenge.

162
00:08:55,417 --> 00:08:57,911
You haven't changed
a bit, have you?

163
00:08:57,956 --> 00:09:00,325
On the contrary, I'm a new man.

164
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:04,895
I no longer have a need
for conquest or power.

165
00:09:06,008 --> 00:09:08,640
I'm far beyond all that.

166
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:15,153
I exist in a state
of complete clarity...

167
00:09:15,197 --> 00:09:20,471
a clarity I intend to share
with the universe.

168
00:09:21,646 --> 00:09:24,210
You're right, Dukat,
you have changed.

169
00:09:24,252 --> 00:09:27,818
You've gone from being
a self-important egotist

170
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:30,332
to a self-deluded madman.

171
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,668
I hardly call that
an improvement.

172
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:36,169
I don't have time for this.

173
00:09:36,215 --> 00:09:37,183
Remove him.

174
00:09:37,217 --> 00:09:38,413
Wait.

175
00:09:40,424 --> 00:09:41,757
Why did you come?

176
00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:43,856
Isn't that obvious?

177
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:47,898
To give you what you desire
above all else...

178
00:09:47,942 --> 00:09:49,571
the Alpha Quadrant.

179
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,682
All I need
is a certain Bajoran artifact...

180
00:09:54,725 --> 00:09:58,325
one of the many
the Cardassians appropriated

181
00:09:58,368 --> 00:10:00,099
during the occupation.

182
00:10:00,138 --> 00:10:03,408
And how is this artifact
going to help us?

183
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:06,420
Let's just say,
it will make it possible

184
00:10:06,454 --> 00:10:10,225
for Dominion reinforcements
to come through that wormhole

185
00:10:10,262 --> 00:10:14,637
and destroy
Captain Benjamin Sisko

186
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:19,513
and the Federation,
once and for all.

187
00:10:33,552 --> 00:10:34,520
Really, Captain

188
00:10:34,554 --> 00:10:36,354
I see no reason
why I should sit here

189
00:10:36,392 --> 00:10:40,357
and allow this Klingon jackal
to call me a coward.

190
00:10:40,401 --> 00:10:43,705
Apparently, this "jackal"
has more courage

191
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,838
than the entire Romulan Senate.

192
00:10:45,881 --> 00:10:47,111
There, you see my point?

193
00:10:47,151 --> 00:10:49,452
General, you must
try to remain calm.

194
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,122
This is not the time for calm.

195
00:10:52,163 --> 00:10:54,965
It's time to strike the enemy
and strike them hard!

196
00:10:55,003 --> 00:10:56,472
We have found
their weak point.

197
00:10:56,507 --> 00:10:57,601
Now we need to exploit it.

198
00:10:57,642 --> 00:10:59,738
But this <i>p'tagh</i>
would rather sit home

199
00:10:59,847 --> 00:11:01,009
and count his dead.

200
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:03,215
If we invade Cardassia now

201
00:11:03,256 --> 00:11:06,161
all we'll do is count our dead.

202
00:11:06,196 --> 00:11:07,164
Gentlemen, please.

203
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,102
We're allies, remember that.

204
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:12,702
What good is an ally
who'll stab you in the back?

205
00:11:12,813 --> 00:11:15,445
Notice the primitive rage
in his eye

206
00:11:15,485 --> 00:11:17,649
the uncontrolled brutality?

207
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:21,131
Klingons can be quite
entertaining, can't they?

208
00:11:21,165 --> 00:11:24,195
Every Romulan zoo
should have a pair.

209
00:11:25,242 --> 00:11:26,836
Sit down, General!

210
00:11:30,154 --> 00:11:32,854
Save your anger
for the Dominion.

211
00:11:41,982 --> 00:11:44,215
Senator...

212
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,784
you've studied
our invasion plans.

213
00:11:46,894 --> 00:11:48,728
Yes, I have

214
00:11:48,765 --> 00:11:52,604
and I continue
to find them premature.

215
00:11:52,641 --> 00:11:56,207
Let the Dominion continue
to send its fleets against us

216
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:59,017
and we will annihilate them
one by one.

217
00:11:59,056 --> 00:12:00,423
And they'll continue

218
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,454
to rebuild their ships
and send more.

219
00:12:02,498 --> 00:12:06,030
The Dominion breed Jem'Hadar
faster than we can destroy them.

220
00:12:06,073 --> 00:12:08,340
The only way to achieve
a lasting victory

221
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:11,375
is to demolish their shipyards

222
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,086
their weapons plants

223
00:12:14,126 --> 00:12:16,997
to force them to retreat
deeper and deeper

224
00:12:17,032 --> 00:12:18,797
into their own territory

225
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:21,435
until our ships
can surround their headquarters

226
00:12:21,477 --> 00:12:23,037
on Cardassia Prime

227
00:12:23,081 --> 00:12:26,351
and they will have no choice
but to surrender.

228
00:12:29,095 --> 00:12:31,464
I know it won't be easy.

229
00:12:33,706 --> 00:12:35,836
I know that we will pay
a heavy price

230
00:12:35,945 --> 00:12:39,181
for every system
we take from them

231
00:12:39,219 --> 00:12:40,620
but in the end

232
00:12:40,656 --> 00:12:42,148
that's the only way

233
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,563
to drive the Dominion
out of the Alpha Quadrant

234
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:47,093
and that is the goal
we all share!

235
00:12:47,138 --> 00:12:50,408
Klingons, humans...

236
00:12:50,446 --> 00:12:52,349
and Romulans.

237
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,091
Here's to those
who love not wisely

238
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:14,797
No, not wisely, but too well

239
00:13:14,838 --> 00:13:17,868
To the girl who sighs with envy

240
00:13:17,913 --> 00:13:21,319
When she hears
that wedding bell

241
00:13:21,353 --> 00:13:24,383
To the guy who'd throw a party

242
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:27,766
If he knew someone to call

243
00:13:27,802 --> 00:13:31,072
Here's to the losers

244
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,639
Bless them all

245
00:13:33,684 --> 00:13:37,352
Hey, Tom, Dick and Harry

246
00:13:37,392 --> 00:13:40,628
Come in out of the rain

247
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,503
Those torches you carry

248
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,276
Must be drowned in champagne

249
00:13:47,316 --> 00:13:51,315
Here's the last toast
of the evening

250
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:54,629
Here's to those
who still believe

251
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,663
All the losers will be winners

252
00:13:57,707 --> 00:14:01,239
All the givers shall receive

253
00:14:01,282 --> 00:14:04,586
Here's to trouble-free tomorrows

254
00:14:04,624 --> 00:14:07,654
May your sorrows all be small

255
00:14:07,698 --> 00:14:10,934
Here's to the losers

256
00:14:10,973 --> 00:14:14,744
Here's
to the losers

257
00:14:14,782 --> 00:14:18,154
Here's to the losers

258
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:23,362
Bless them all.

259
00:14:29,116 --> 00:14:30,312
That was great, Vic.

260
00:14:30,352 --> 00:14:32,550
It's not one of the most
requested songs

261
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:34,755
in my repertoire,
but I'm glad you liked it.

262
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,592
So, why the long face, pally?

263
00:14:37,636 --> 00:14:40,507
Ah, it's a long story, friend.

264
00:14:40,543 --> 00:14:42,308
This wouldn't be
about Dax's baby, would it?

265
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,976
What is he, a telepath?

266
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,353
No, I'm a hologram.

267
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,224
A very smart one.

268
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,595
It's simple.

269
00:14:49,632 --> 00:14:51,762
You take one beautiful,
happily married filly

270
00:14:51,804 --> 00:14:54,241
add the possibility
of her giving birth to a foal

271
00:14:54,276 --> 00:14:55,335
and what's it leave you?

272
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:56,678
Couple of lovesick stallions

273
00:14:56,716 --> 00:14:58,550
that never got out
of the starting gate.

274
00:14:58,586 --> 00:15:00,819
You have any idea
what he's talking about?

275
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,692
Hey, I got news for you guys.

276
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,328
It's time to move on
to greener pastures.

277
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,671
It's tough to lose
a woman like Dax.

278
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,645
I hate to break it to you, pally

279
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,651
but you lost her
a long time ago.

280
00:15:11,685 --> 00:15:12,675
You both did.

281
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,850
But lucky for you, space is big.

282
00:15:14,892 --> 00:15:17,922
There are a lot of other
nice girls out there...

283
00:15:17,966 --> 00:15:20,028
with or without spots, <i>capisce?</i>

284
00:15:20,104 --> 00:15:21,037
That's it?

285
00:15:21,107 --> 00:15:23,739
That's supposed to cheer us up?

286
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:27,050
"The truth shall set you free."

287
00:15:28,993 --> 00:15:30,827
You feel any better?

288
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:32,265
A little.

289
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,498
How about you?

290
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,066
I guess.

291
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:40,552
Good, 'cause you were starting
to depress the band.

292
00:15:40,587 --> 00:15:42,649
Well, thanks, Vic.

293
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,423
We appreciate the advice.

294
00:15:44,463 --> 00:15:45,693
I like this place.

295
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:47,430
I may drop by more often.

296
00:15:47,471 --> 00:15:49,305
Anytime, pally, anytime.

297
00:15:55,323 --> 00:15:57,887
Nice guys...

298
00:15:57,929 --> 00:16:00,846
but absolutely clueless.

299
00:16:00,979 --> 00:16:02,278
So, when do we leave?

300
00:16:02,316 --> 00:16:03,842
We?

301
00:16:03,887 --> 00:16:06,154
I'm a journalist, Dad, remember?

302
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:09,256
Well, that may be true,
but you're not going, Jake.

303
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,866
But, Dad, we're talking about
the invasion of Cardassia...

304
00:16:12,908 --> 00:16:14,879
a savage thrust
into the very heart

305
00:16:14,913 --> 00:16:16,473
of the Dominion.

306
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,183
Well, I mean, that's not
how I would write it.

307
00:16:19,223 --> 00:16:22,355
That's a relief,
but you're still not going, son.

308
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:26,171
I have to go.
It's my job.

309
00:16:26,207 --> 00:16:28,771
Now, if you don't want
me on the <i>Defiant,</i> fine.

310
00:16:28,813 --> 00:16:30,807
I'll go with General Martok.

311
00:16:30,851 --> 00:16:35,021
Hey, get the story
from a Klingon perspective.

312
00:16:37,601 --> 00:16:40,438
All right, Jake,
the <i>Defiant</i> it is.

313
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,239
So, when do we leave?

314
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:45,879
Just keep your bags packed.

315
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,050
Yes, sir.

316
00:16:58,785 --> 00:16:59,947
Don't worry, Dad.

317
00:16:59,988 --> 00:17:02,152
We'll watch out for each other.

318
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:13,279
The Sisko is of Bajor.

319
00:17:14,957 --> 00:17:17,190
It is where he belongs.

320
00:17:17,229 --> 00:17:21,194
It is where he is meant to be.

321
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:24,269
Are you telling me
not to go to Cardassia?

322
00:17:24,313 --> 00:17:26,341
The Sisko is of Bajor.

323
00:17:26,384 --> 00:17:30,189
It is dangerous
to walk a different path.

324
00:17:30,227 --> 00:17:32,391
Dangerous? In what way?

325
00:17:32,432 --> 00:17:36,237
The Sisko must not leave
the chosen path.

326
00:17:36,275 --> 00:17:38,804
The Sisko is of Bajor.

327
00:17:38,847 --> 00:17:41,080
It is where he belongs.

328
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,887
Why is it dangerous to leave?

329
00:17:43,926 --> 00:17:47,526
And how will it affect Bajor?

330
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:49,403
You have to tell me.

331
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,707
The Cardassians call them
orbital weapon platforms.

332
00:18:06,814 --> 00:18:08,978
Intelligence reports indicate

333
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:10,648
the Dominion has
placed hundreds of them

334
00:18:10,691 --> 00:18:12,719
throughout
the Chin'toka system.

335
00:18:12,762 --> 00:18:14,527
Are they operational?

336
00:18:14,566 --> 00:18:16,195
- No, not yet.
- How much time

337
00:18:16,238 --> 00:18:17,571
do we have before they are?

338
00:18:17,608 --> 00:18:18,941
Two, maybe three days.

339
00:18:18,977 --> 00:18:21,506
So, it would appear
that your weak spot

340
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,646
is about to become
much stronger.

341
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:25,955
Leave it to a Romulan

342
00:18:25,994 --> 00:18:28,090
to run at the first sign
of trouble.

343
00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:29,328
And leave it

344
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:32,501
to a Klingon to leap
to the wrong conclusion.

345
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:34,068
The Romulan Empire

346
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,643
has agreed to join
the invasion of Cardassia

347
00:18:36,686 --> 00:18:39,591
and we live up
to our agreements.

348
00:18:39,626 --> 00:18:42,531
The only question is:
Can the invasion

349
00:18:42,566 --> 00:18:45,802
be launched before
the defensive grid is activated?

350
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:48,541
We'll have to leave
first thing in the morning.

351
00:18:48,581 --> 00:18:49,948
Then it's settled.

352
00:18:49,985 --> 00:18:50,953
Good luck, gentlemen.

353
00:18:50,987 --> 00:18:53,322
Good luck to all of us.

354
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:56,731
Romulans don't believe in luck.

355
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:57,826
All the better!

356
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:01,879
It leaves more
for the rest of us.

357
00:19:04,854 --> 00:19:06,483
You've been, uh, quiet, Ben.

358
00:19:06,524 --> 00:19:08,995
Those weapon platforms
have you worried?

359
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,830
It's not about that, sir.

360
00:19:12,672 --> 00:19:14,768
It's about the Prophets.

361
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,781
The wormhole aliens...

362
00:19:16,815 --> 00:19:18,615
they spoke to me last night.

363
00:19:19,923 --> 00:19:22,326
I hope they gave
the mission their blessing.

364
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:25,768
They told me
not to go to Cardassia.

365
00:19:25,804 --> 00:19:27,707
That I should stay here.

366
00:19:27,742 --> 00:19:29,804
Did they give you a reason?

367
00:19:29,846 --> 00:19:31,680
Nothing concrete.

368
00:19:31,718 --> 00:19:34,452
Just that it's too dangerous.

369
00:19:34,491 --> 00:19:35,585
In what way?

370
00:19:35,628 --> 00:19:37,393
Dangerous to you?
To the mission?

371
00:19:37,432 --> 00:19:38,526
To Bajor?

372
00:19:38,568 --> 00:19:40,231
I'm not sure.

373
00:19:40,272 --> 00:19:42,641
What is it you're telling me,
Ben?

374
00:19:42,677 --> 00:19:44,841
You want permission
to stay behind?

375
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,751
It's not about what I want.

376
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:49,156
It's about what the Prophets
want.

377
00:19:49,194 --> 00:19:50,527
That's not
a good enough answer...

378
00:19:50,563 --> 00:19:52,625
not from a Starfleet Captain.

379
00:19:52,668 --> 00:19:56,302
The Prophets don't see me
as a Starfleet Captain.

380
00:19:56,344 --> 00:19:58,372
They see me as their Emissary.

381
00:19:58,415 --> 00:20:00,249
That's the problem, isn't it?

382
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:02,918
For the past six years,
you've tried to be both

383
00:20:03,026 --> 00:20:04,427
and up to now,
I've been patient.

384
00:20:04,463 --> 00:20:05,659
I've indulged you.

385
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,163
I've gone out on a limb for you
many times, but this is it.

386
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,472
You've got to make a decision.

387
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:13,143
You are either the Emissary
or a Starfleet Captain.

388
00:20:14,287 --> 00:20:16,451
You can't be both.

389
00:20:21,771 --> 00:20:23,104
I'll...

390
00:20:27,986 --> 00:20:32,122
I'll be on the <i>Defiant</i> Bridge
at 0500.

391
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:38,927
The combined fleet
at Deep Space 9?

392
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:42,172
Composed of Federation,
Klingon and Romulan ships.

393
00:20:42,213 --> 00:20:44,343
You think they'll head
for the Chin'toka system?

394
00:20:44,384 --> 00:20:45,580
I would.

395
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,320
Well, then,
we have nothing to worry about.

396
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,231
The weapon platforms
will be operational

397
00:20:51,267 --> 00:20:52,292
in time to greet them.

398
00:20:52,337 --> 00:20:53,704
That's a very comforting thought

399
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,039
if it's accurate.

400
00:20:55,077 --> 00:20:56,444
I'll make sure that it is.

401
00:20:57,749 --> 00:21:01,212
Gentlemen, I hope
I'm not interrupting.

402
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,686
What is it now, Dukat?

403
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:05,132
I've found it.

404
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:06,431
Behold...

405
00:21:06,504 --> 00:21:08,702
the key to victory.

406
00:21:10,914 --> 00:21:13,682
Oh, I see you remain skeptical.

407
00:21:13,721 --> 00:21:16,022
Well, you won't be for long.

408
00:21:17,163 --> 00:21:21,105
Over the past few months,
I've immersed myself

409
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:24,477
in the study
of the Bajoran ancient texts

410
00:21:24,547 --> 00:21:28,044
and I've come to realize
that the wormhole

411
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:31,996
is much more than the gateway
to the Gamma Quadrant.

412
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:35,972
It's the Temple of the Prophets.

413
00:21:36,008 --> 00:21:37,170
It's from there

414
00:21:37,211 --> 00:21:40,947
that they smile
benevolently down on Bajor.

415
00:21:40,986 --> 00:21:43,082
It's from there

416
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:47,295
that they protect that world
and its people.

417
00:21:47,335 --> 00:21:49,431
The sad truth is

418
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:53,439
we wasted our time
fighting the Bajorans

419
00:21:53,483 --> 00:21:57,482
when we should have been
fighting their gods.

420
00:21:57,526 --> 00:22:00,192
How do you fight a god?

421
00:22:00,233 --> 00:22:01,258
I'll show you.

422
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:04,502
You see...

423
00:22:04,576 --> 00:22:07,105
we have an ally
we never knew we had.

424
00:22:08,352 --> 00:22:09,514
You may want to step back.

425
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:12,955
<i>Dorrah</i>

426
00:22:12,997 --> 00:22:16,460
<i>tolka betri...</i>

427
00:22:16,504 --> 00:22:18,064
<i>pah'rahn</i>

428
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:19,738
<i>meedor.</i>

429
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:26,091
<i>Dorrah tolka... ullkess</i>

430
00:22:26,128 --> 00:22:29,067
<i>pah'rahn!</i>

431
00:22:31,608 --> 00:22:33,339
Dukat!

432
00:22:39,727 --> 00:22:42,928
Your concern is touching...

433
00:22:42,968 --> 00:22:44,699
but unnecessary.

434
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:54,253
Busy?

435
00:22:54,295 --> 00:22:58,431
Uh... a little.

436
00:22:58,472 --> 00:22:59,941
Well, I'm leaving
with the task force

437
00:22:59,975 --> 00:23:01,274
first thing in the morning.

438
00:23:01,312 --> 00:23:02,245
I heard.

439
00:23:03,317 --> 00:23:04,581
And?

440
00:23:04,654 --> 00:23:05,953
And...

441
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,152
I'm sorry I arrested him.

442
00:23:07,192 --> 00:23:08,320
I was simply

443
00:23:08,362 --> 00:23:10,424
trying to do my duty,
but I can see

444
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:12,734
how it might have
seemed excessive.

445
00:23:12,773 --> 00:23:14,801
What are you talking about?

446
00:23:14,844 --> 00:23:16,541
Vedek Solis.

447
00:23:16,582 --> 00:23:17,983
That's why you're here,
isn't it?

448
00:23:18,018 --> 00:23:19,317
No...

449
00:23:19,355 --> 00:23:21,553
but now I know
why you've been avoiding me

450
00:23:21,594 --> 00:23:22,790
for the past few days.

451
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,824
I haven't been avoiding you.

452
00:23:24,868 --> 00:23:28,536
I've been helping you
to avoid me.

453
00:23:28,577 --> 00:23:30,137
Why would I want to do that?

454
00:23:30,181 --> 00:23:34,521
Because... you don't want us
to be together anymore?

455
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,860
Is that what you've
been thinking?

456
00:23:39,571 --> 00:23:42,373
Odo, we had an argument.

457
00:23:42,411 --> 00:23:44,609
People have them all the time.

458
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:45,675
Look at Dax and Worf.

459
00:23:45,785 --> 00:23:47,688
They love each other,
but they fight all the time.

460
00:23:47,757 --> 00:23:49,226
Are you saying that you love me?

461
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,285
Don't change the subject.

462
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,298
Which is?

463
00:23:51,332 --> 00:23:52,961
I don't even know anymore.

464
00:23:53,002 --> 00:23:55,269
But you're no longer angry
with me?

465
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:58,304
No, but you were wrong
to arrest the vedek.

466
00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:00,149
- I see.
- And I thought

467
00:24:00,186 --> 00:24:02,623
that we could spend my last
night on the station together.

468
00:24:04,329 --> 00:24:05,923
That's a wonderful idea.

469
00:24:05,967 --> 00:24:08,599
Then I will see you later.

470
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,340
I look forward to that.

471
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,906
Good.

472
00:24:22,072 --> 00:24:24,670
You know, Nerys...

473
00:24:24,712 --> 00:24:30,716
observing humanoid relationships
and being in one...

474
00:24:30,826 --> 00:24:34,164
are very different things.

475
00:24:34,201 --> 00:24:36,001
Like night and day.

476
00:24:39,347 --> 00:24:41,545
If you ask me, it's an
ungodly hour to go to war.

477
00:24:41,585 --> 00:24:42,747
You can quote me on that.

478
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:43,951
I will.

479
00:24:43,992 --> 00:24:45,120
Oh, Jadzia, will you look in

480
00:24:45,161 --> 00:24:46,721
on Keiko and the kids
while I'm gone?

481
00:24:46,765 --> 00:24:47,859
You can count on it.

482
00:24:47,901 --> 00:24:50,099
And try to keep
Julian out of trouble.

483
00:24:50,139 --> 00:24:51,574
Now, that's pushing.

484
00:24:52,646 --> 00:24:54,343
It's your station, old man.

485
00:24:54,383 --> 00:24:55,647
I'll take good care of her.

486
00:24:57,991 --> 00:24:59,791
Give my best to the Jem'Hadar.

487
00:24:59,896 --> 00:25:00,886
Oh, I'll do that.

488
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,732
I said a prayer
at the shrine last night

489
00:25:02,837 --> 00:25:03,931
for the two of you.

490
00:25:03,973 --> 00:25:05,306
About having a baby?

491
00:25:05,343 --> 00:25:07,941
The Prophets can be helpful
in such matters.

492
00:25:07,982 --> 00:25:09,576
I hope they're listening.

493
00:25:12,527 --> 00:25:13,894
Did you hear that?

494
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,661
We have the Prophets
on our side.

495
00:25:15,701 --> 00:25:19,142
According to Dr. Bashir,
we need all the help we can get.

496
00:25:19,176 --> 00:25:20,770
Just remember when you get back

497
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,440
we have a lot of work to do.

498
00:25:22,483 --> 00:25:25,889
I don't consider that work.

499
00:25:28,097 --> 00:25:29,897
Wish I was going with you.

500
00:25:29,935 --> 00:25:32,133
You are...

501
00:25:32,173 --> 00:25:34,235
in here.

502
00:25:35,548 --> 00:25:37,644
I love it
when you get romantic.

503
00:25:57,267 --> 00:25:58,235
Captain on the Bridge!

504
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,398
As you were.

505
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:02,310
You got here early.

506
00:26:02,346 --> 00:26:04,476
This is a momentous occasion.

507
00:26:04,517 --> 00:26:05,576
It's not every day

508
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:08,023
I embark on a journey
to liberate my homeworld.

509
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:09,426
That's one way to put it.

510
00:26:09,463 --> 00:26:12,129
This is General Martok
to all ships.

511
00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:13,536
Assume tactical formation.

512
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:15,476
We are moving out.

513
00:26:15,511 --> 00:26:17,505
Take us to Cardassia, Mr. Nog.

514
00:26:17,548 --> 00:26:18,573
Aye, sir.

515
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,331
The enemy fleet is approaching
the Chin'toka system.

516
00:26:31,377 --> 00:26:33,941
What's the status
of our weapon platforms?

517
00:26:33,982 --> 00:26:36,146
Still off line.

518
00:26:37,357 --> 00:26:38,587
It pains me to say this

519
00:26:38,627 --> 00:26:41,623
but you Cardassians are proving
to be quite a disappointment.

520
00:26:42,904 --> 00:26:44,932
I'll remind you
that you said that.

521
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:02,142
Looks like we're in luck,
Captain.

522
00:27:02,217 --> 00:27:04,154
The defensive grid's
still off line.

523
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,022
Jem'Hadar fighters approaching.

524
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:08,793
Bearing 059 mark 031.

525
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:10,667
They must know
they don't stand a chance

526
00:27:10,704 --> 00:27:12,139
against a fleet this size.

527
00:27:12,175 --> 00:27:14,909
That will not matter
to the Jem'Hadar.

528
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:17,951
Sit down, Jake.

529
00:27:17,988 --> 00:27:19,982
Right.

530
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,324
Martok to Sisko.

531
00:27:22,365 --> 00:27:23,527
Go ahead.

532
00:27:23,569 --> 00:27:26,201
My attack wing is closest
to those Jem'Hadar fighters.

533
00:27:26,275 --> 00:27:27,835
Preparing to engage.

534
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,280
Good luck, General.

535
00:27:48,394 --> 00:27:50,524
I always thought
the Jem'Hadar were crazy.

536
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:52,663
There's method to their madness.

537
00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:55,769
They're inflicting considerable
damage on the Klingons.

538
00:27:55,812 --> 00:27:58,580
And buying time to get their
weapon platforms operational.

539
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:00,419
Sisko to Martok.

540
00:28:00,456 --> 00:28:03,190
The Jem'Hadar have managed
to cripple or destroy

541
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,927
15 of my ships.

542
00:28:04,968 --> 00:28:06,962
Do you need any assistance?

543
00:28:07,006 --> 00:28:08,065
That won't be necessary.

544
00:28:08,108 --> 00:28:10,740
Commence firing
on the weapon platforms.

545
00:28:48,706 --> 00:28:50,471
I believe you owe me an apology.

546
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,877
I believe you're right.

547
00:28:51,913 --> 00:28:53,348
Now, if Dukat can get

548
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,284
our reinforcements
through the wormhole...

549
00:28:55,321 --> 00:28:58,192
I'm not sure how much faith
I have in this...

550
00:28:58,228 --> 00:28:59,196
What did he call it?

551
00:28:59,231 --> 00:29:00,632
Pah-wraith.

552
00:29:00,668 --> 00:29:03,300
Pah-wraiths and Prophets?

553
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,140
All this talk of god strikes me

554
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:08,642
as nothing more
than superstitious nonsense.

555
00:29:08,687 --> 00:29:11,489
You believe that the Founders
are gods, don't you?

556
00:29:11,527 --> 00:29:12,655
That's different.

557
00:29:12,696 --> 00:29:14,188
In what way?

558
00:29:14,233 --> 00:29:15,600
The Founders are Gods.

559
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:31,599
We are unable to penetrate
their force fields.

560
00:29:31,642 --> 00:29:32,906
Captain

561
00:29:32,945 --> 00:29:36,750
I've just noted something odd
about those platforms.

562
00:29:36,787 --> 00:29:39,692
Well, don't keep it to yourself,
Mr. Garak.

563
00:29:39,728 --> 00:29:43,396
Not one of them seems to have
a power generator on board.

564
00:29:43,503 --> 00:29:44,402
He's right.

565
00:29:44,506 --> 00:29:45,770
Each one seems to be
getting its power

566
00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:47,506
from a central source.

567
00:29:47,547 --> 00:29:49,609
We got to find that source
and destroy it.

568
00:29:49,652 --> 00:29:50,848
Chief?

569
00:29:50,888 --> 00:29:51,878
I'm on it.

570
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:01,042
According to the DNA
scans I did this morning

571
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:03,141
the ovarian resequencing
enzymes I gave you

572
00:30:03,184 --> 00:30:05,155
appear to be working.

573
00:30:05,189 --> 00:30:06,453
You mean, Worf and I
can have a baby?

574
00:30:06,526 --> 00:30:07,893
It certainly looks that way.

575
00:30:07,929 --> 00:30:10,458
I must say, I didn't expect
such positive results so early.

576
00:30:10,501 --> 00:30:12,061
It's quite amazing, actually.

577
00:30:12,105 --> 00:30:13,836
Oh, thank you, Julian!

578
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,706
It's all part of being a doctor.

579
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,014
Oh, no, it's more than that.

580
00:30:18,053 --> 00:30:20,685
You're a good friend...
you always have been.

581
00:30:20,726 --> 00:30:21,956
And I always will be.

582
00:30:24,802 --> 00:30:27,502
I'd better get back to work.

583
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:30,639
But first I'm going to stop by
the Bajoran shrine.

584
00:30:30,683 --> 00:30:32,517
What for?

585
00:30:32,588 --> 00:30:34,525
Kira said a prayer
for me and Worf last night.

586
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,530
She told the Prophets how much
we wanted a baby.

587
00:30:36,631 --> 00:30:37,895
Well, I'd say
they've been listening.

588
00:30:37,934 --> 00:30:41,135
That is, if you believe
in the Prophets.

589
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:42,906
Oh, well, I do today.

590
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:04,196
I'm not sure
if I'm doing this correctly.

591
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:07,260
I... I don't come here a lot.

592
00:31:07,305 --> 00:31:10,301
And to be perfectly honest

593
00:31:10,345 --> 00:31:14,047
I feel more comfortable thinking
of you as wormhole aliens

594
00:31:14,087 --> 00:31:15,579
but, um...

595
00:31:17,462 --> 00:31:20,026
Kira believes
you're much more than that.

596
00:31:20,068 --> 00:31:22,471
Maybe she's right.

597
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:23,841
I don't know.

598
00:31:25,481 --> 00:31:29,320
But if you are Prophets
and you're listening

599
00:31:29,357 --> 00:31:31,054
I just want to say...

600
00:31:38,512 --> 00:31:39,377
Dukat.

601
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:41,426
Dad, what is it?

602
00:32:41,463 --> 00:32:42,431
Captain!

603
00:32:45,975 --> 00:32:47,672
I'm not sure.

604
00:32:47,712 --> 00:32:52,952
I think I felt the Prophets
reaching out to me.

605
00:32:52,991 --> 00:32:54,825
Something's wrong.

606
00:32:56,666 --> 00:32:58,637
Sir, I found it.

607
00:32:58,671 --> 00:33:01,439
There's a subspace power
generator on a small moon

608
00:33:01,478 --> 00:33:03,506
orbiting the far planet.

609
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:06,613
It's transmitting energy
to the weapon platforms.

610
00:33:06,656 --> 00:33:07,784
Captain?

611
00:33:07,826 --> 00:33:10,297
Take us there, Mr. Nog.

612
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:11,266
Aye, sir.

613
00:33:11,301 --> 00:33:12,702
Get him back to his quarters.

614
00:33:12,738 --> 00:33:13,706
Don't worry, Captain.

615
00:33:13,807 --> 00:33:14,969
We'll get the job done.

616
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:33,647
I know this is small comfort

617
00:33:33,688 --> 00:33:37,527
but I never intended you
any harm.

618
00:34:04,266 --> 00:34:05,565
Approaching the target.

619
00:34:05,603 --> 00:34:07,095
Onscreen.

620
00:34:11,951 --> 00:34:13,477
Target locked.

621
00:34:13,522 --> 00:34:14,957
Fire.

622
00:34:23,646 --> 00:34:26,244
We are unable to penetrate
the moon's defensive grid.

623
00:34:28,491 --> 00:34:29,459
Sir, I have an idea.

624
00:34:29,493 --> 00:34:30,860
Go ahead.

625
00:34:30,896 --> 00:34:34,028
Maybe we can't destroy
that power generator

626
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:35,768
but I bet
those weapon platforms could.

627
00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:39,214
Why would they fire
on their own power source?

628
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,850
We'd have to fool the platform's
targeting systems

629
00:34:42,892 --> 00:34:44,988
into thinking
the generator's an enemy ship.

630
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,798
We can use our deflector array
to imprint a Federation

631
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:50,867
warp signature on the
generator's energy matrix.

632
00:34:52,114 --> 00:34:53,378
It is worth a try.

633
00:34:59,131 --> 00:35:01,193
Evasive maneuvers, Mr. Nog.

634
00:35:01,236 --> 00:35:02,865
Pattern theta.

635
00:35:09,656 --> 00:35:10,784
Induction stabilizers set.

636
00:35:10,825 --> 00:35:12,693
Booster modulators synchronized.

637
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:15,031
Ready to activate deflector.

638
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:16,561
Do it.

639
00:35:31,408 --> 00:35:32,398
Yes!

640
00:35:34,749 --> 00:35:35,739
We did it.

641
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,425
Martok to <i>Defiant.</i>

642
00:35:55,499 --> 00:35:56,432
Go ahead, General.

643
00:35:56,535 --> 00:35:57,902
Well done, Major.

644
00:35:57,938 --> 00:35:59,772
We will begin
transporting ground troops

645
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:02,008
to both planets immediately.

646
00:36:04,521 --> 00:36:06,321
Major, we're receiving
a priority one

647
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:08,330
transmission from Deep Space 9.

648
00:36:08,363 --> 00:36:10,026
It's from Julian.

649
00:36:15,246 --> 00:36:16,943
This is a disaster.

650
00:36:16,984 --> 00:36:19,786
Federation soldiers
have landed on Cardassian soil

651
00:36:19,824 --> 00:36:21,521
and now you're telling me

652
00:36:21,562 --> 00:36:22,587
the wormhole is gone?

653
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,826
And with it, any chance

654
00:36:23,867 --> 00:36:26,396
of getting reinforcements
from the Gamma Quadrant.

655
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,934
I'm well aware
things didn't turn out

656
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:30,209
quite the way I planned

657
00:36:30,249 --> 00:36:33,883
but I assure you, we still
achieved a great victory.

658
00:36:33,924 --> 00:36:36,293
Forgive me if I don't
share your euphoria.

659
00:36:36,331 --> 00:36:37,800
Well, you should.

660
00:36:37,834 --> 00:36:42,300
The Bajoran people have been
cut off from their Gods

661
00:36:42,345 --> 00:36:43,473
perhaps forever.

662
00:36:43,515 --> 00:36:45,109
How does that help us?

663
00:36:45,151 --> 00:36:48,614
Because Sisko has been cut off
from the Prophets as well

664
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,254
and without the Prophets

665
00:36:50,297 --> 00:36:53,327
he's just another
Starfleet Captain.

666
00:36:53,371 --> 00:36:55,433
And that's supposed
to make me feel better?

667
00:36:55,476 --> 00:36:57,344
Oh...

668
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,844
believe me... it will.

669
00:37:14,322 --> 00:37:16,190
Emissary, Emissary.

670
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:23,676
Emissary!

671
00:37:23,711 --> 00:37:25,909
My mother says
all the Orbs are dark

672
00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:28,182
that the Prophets
have abandoned us.

673
00:37:28,221 --> 00:37:30,192
You have to find them, Emissary.

674
00:37:30,226 --> 00:37:33,256
You have to ask them
to come back.

675
00:37:38,379 --> 00:37:39,973
I will try.

676
00:38:06,714 --> 00:38:09,312
I managed to save
the Dax symbiont.

677
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:13,352
We have to get it to Trill
as soon as possible.

678
00:38:14,866 --> 00:38:16,996
There was, um...

679
00:38:17,038 --> 00:38:19,100
nothing I could do for Jadzia.

680
00:38:30,738 --> 00:38:32,766
I'm... I'm sorry.

681
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:38,579
Save your strength.

682
00:38:49,917 --> 00:38:52,981
Our baby...

683
00:38:53,025 --> 00:38:56,295
would have been so beautiful.

684
00:39:28,944 --> 00:39:33,684
<i>NeH taH Qo'noS.</i>

685
00:39:33,722 --> 00:39:38,496
<i>Hegh bat'lhqu Hoch nej maH.</i>

686
00:39:38,533 --> 00:39:41,803
<i>NeH taH Qo'noS.</i>

687
00:39:41,841 --> 00:39:50,124
<i>Yay je bat'lh manob Hegh.</i>

688
00:40:03,852 --> 00:40:08,352
The funeral service is due to
begin in a few minutes, Jadzia

689
00:40:08,396 --> 00:40:11,632
but I need to talk to you
one last time.

690
00:40:13,107 --> 00:40:15,078
When I first met you

691
00:40:15,111 --> 00:40:19,076
you told me that my relationship
with Jadzia Dax

692
00:40:19,121 --> 00:40:20,989
wouldn't be any different

693
00:40:21,026 --> 00:40:23,658
than the one I had
with Curzon Dax.

694
00:40:24,802 --> 00:40:27,331
Things didn't work out that way.

695
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:32,217
I had a hell of a lot of fun
with both of you.

696
00:40:33,522 --> 00:40:36,086
But Curzon was my mentor.

697
00:40:36,129 --> 00:40:42,133
You... you were my friend

698
00:40:42,243 --> 00:40:43,974
and I am going to miss you.

699
00:40:47,155 --> 00:40:49,456
I should've listened
to the Prophets

700
00:40:49,494 --> 00:40:52,160
and not gone to Cardassia.

701
00:40:52,267 --> 00:40:55,468
Then maybe you'd still be alive.

702
00:40:57,212 --> 00:40:58,613
Damn it!

703
00:41:00,721 --> 00:41:03,455
Why aren't you still here,
Jadzia?

704
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:06,490
I need you to help me
sort things out.

705
00:41:06,535 --> 00:41:08,563
Something's happened
to the Prophets...

706
00:41:08,606 --> 00:41:11,876
something that's made them
turn their backs on Bajor

707
00:41:11,915 --> 00:41:13,749
and I'm responsible

708
00:41:13,785 --> 00:41:15,813
and I don't know
what to do about it

709
00:41:15,857 --> 00:41:20,597
how to make... it right again.

710
00:41:21,972 --> 00:41:24,570
I've failed as the Emissary...

711
00:41:24,612 --> 00:41:26,845
and for the first time
in my life

712
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:30,689
I've failed in my duty
as a Starfleet officer.

713
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,664
I need time to think...

714
00:41:37,008 --> 00:41:39,742
clear my head...

715
00:41:39,782 --> 00:41:42,219
but I can't do it here

716
00:41:42,287 --> 00:41:44,451
not on the station

717
00:41:44,492 --> 00:41:45,984
not now.

718
00:41:47,801 --> 00:41:49,635
I need to get away.

719
00:41:52,779 --> 00:41:57,814
And find a way to figure out
how to make things right again.

720
00:41:57,858 --> 00:42:02,062
And I have to make things
right again, Jadzia.

721
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:05,303
I have to.

722
00:42:16,302 --> 00:42:18,432
The station's all yours, Major.

723
00:42:18,474 --> 00:42:20,945
She'll be here
when you get back.

724
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,449
This leave of absence
you're taking, sir

725
00:42:22,484 --> 00:42:24,113
how long do you think
you'll be gone?

726
00:42:24,155 --> 00:42:25,784
I don't know exactly.

727
00:42:25,825 --> 00:42:26,953
We'll be waiting.

728
00:42:28,865 --> 00:42:30,357
Good luck, sir.

729
00:42:34,612 --> 00:42:35,979
Thanks, Chief.

730
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:41,585
My thanks to all of you.

731
00:42:46,107 --> 00:42:48,169
Let's go home, Jake.

732
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:00,534
Landing Pad C.

733
00:43:20,957 --> 00:43:23,155
I was afraid of that.

734
00:43:23,195 --> 00:43:25,291
He's not sure he's coming back.

735
00:43:25,334 --> 00:43:27,271
What makes you say that?

736
00:43:27,306 --> 00:43:29,140
His baseball...

737
00:43:29,177 --> 00:43:30,840
he took it with him.

738
00:43:53,469 --> 00:43:55,166
Dad...

739
00:43:55,206 --> 00:43:57,906
Grandpa's ready to close
up the restaurant.

740
00:43:57,946 --> 00:44:00,008
He wants to know when
you're coming in.

741
00:44:01,186 --> 00:44:02,587
In a little while.
