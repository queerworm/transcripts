1
00:00:06,475 --> 00:00:10,315
I found 27 voles
in his storeroom.

2
00:00:10,352 --> 00:00:12,688
Vole infestations are not
uncommon on this station.

3
00:00:12,724 --> 00:00:14,718
If you don't believe me,
ask Chief O'Brien.

4
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:16,199
When I came in

5
00:00:16,301 --> 00:00:20,368
he and Morn were painting
numbers on the voles' backs.

6
00:00:20,412 --> 00:00:25,687
We were just... counting them
to see how many we'd caught.

7
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:27,855
You were getting ready
to stage a vole fight.

8
00:00:27,898 --> 00:00:30,234
A vole fight?

9
00:00:30,303 --> 00:00:32,001
I'm appalled.

10
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:35,710
Do you really think that was
what Morn was up to?

11
00:00:35,751 --> 00:00:37,517
Constable, I want the voles
confiscated

12
00:00:37,556 --> 00:00:38,957
and removed from the station.

13
00:00:38,992 --> 00:00:41,464
You can't confiscate
Morn's voles.

14
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,866
They're like his pets.

15
00:00:42,903 --> 00:00:46,002
I'll see if I can
get him some goldfish.

16
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,879
Now, gentlemen,
if you will excuse me

17
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:50,890
it's late.

18
00:00:52,127 --> 00:00:53,494
Poor Morn.

19
00:00:53,531 --> 00:00:55,833
This is going
to break his hearts.

20
00:00:58,844 --> 00:01:00,747
Ops is yours, Lieutenant.

21
00:01:04,124 --> 00:01:06,095
You going somewhere, Chief?

22
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,932
Sir, I need to talk to you.

23
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,941
It's kind of private.

24
00:01:10,975 --> 00:01:12,639
We were just leaving.

25
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,649
Come on.

26
00:01:13,683 --> 00:01:15,586
Let's go break the news to Morn.

27
00:01:15,621 --> 00:01:17,957
Do you want to talk
in my office?

28
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,726
Actually, I thought
we might go to my place.

29
00:01:19,765 --> 00:01:21,064
Commander!

30
00:01:21,102 --> 00:01:22,732
Stand down.

31
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:25,645
Get on the transporter pad.

32
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:26,672
Move!

33
00:01:48,506 --> 00:01:50,636
Computer...

34
00:01:51,714 --> 00:01:53,480
energize on my command.

35
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,639
Energize.

36
00:02:13,171 --> 00:02:15,005
Where are we?

37
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:16,272
I guess you could say

38
00:02:16,312 --> 00:02:18,876
we just stepped through
the looking glass.

39
00:04:21,014 --> 00:04:23,852
Sit down, make yourself
comfortable.

40
00:04:23,956 --> 00:04:26,190
Right now, I'm not feeling
very comfortable.

41
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,772
There, that's better.

42
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,516
That was a pretty nice move.

43
00:04:36,555 --> 00:04:38,458
I'm glad you liked it.

44
00:04:38,493 --> 00:04:40,053
Of course, it doesn't
change anything.

45
00:04:40,097 --> 00:04:41,066
You can't go home

46
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,196
unless I reconfigure
the transporter

47
00:04:43,238 --> 00:04:45,540
and I'm not about to do that.

48
00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:49,149
I guess you have
a lot of questions.

49
00:04:49,187 --> 00:04:51,215
Not as many as you think.

50
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:52,751
You know where we are?

51
00:04:52,797 --> 00:04:53,925
If I had to guess

52
00:04:54,034 --> 00:04:56,529
I'd say that this is
the same parallel universe

53
00:04:56,573 --> 00:04:59,102
that two of my crew members
visited a year ago.

54
00:04:59,147 --> 00:05:00,981
Oh, you're quick...

55
00:05:01,018 --> 00:05:03,148
just like our Sisko.

56
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,289
That saves me having to give you
a history lesson

57
00:05:06,331 --> 00:05:10,434
but I better update you
on current events.

58
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,348
Since your officers left here,
we've started a rebellion

59
00:05:13,384 --> 00:05:16,324
against the Klingon-
Cardassian alliance.

60
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,453
We're fighting for our lives.

61
00:05:18,497 --> 00:05:19,796
I wish you luck

62
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:22,500
but I don't see
what that has to do with me.

63
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,534
It has everything
to do with you.

64
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:26,311
You were the leader
of the Terran rebellion.

65
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,879
At least,
our Benjamin Sisko was.

66
00:05:28,923 --> 00:05:30,392
Was?

67
00:05:30,428 --> 00:05:32,957
Captain Sisko's dead.

68
00:05:33,034 --> 00:05:34,971
The Cardassians
blew up his ship.

69
00:05:35,006 --> 00:05:39,211
Ah, so you want me
to take his place.

70
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:40,983
Like I said, you're quick.

71
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:42,719
Well, I've got a better idea.

72
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,994
We're going to walk back
to the transporter pad

73
00:05:45,065 --> 00:05:47,093
and you're going
to send me home.

74
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:50,271
Wait. Hear me out.

75
00:05:50,313 --> 00:05:52,409
I'm not asking
for a lifetime commitment.

76
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:53,545
All I need is for you

77
00:05:53,588 --> 00:05:55,354
to finish the mission
Sisko was on

78
00:05:55,393 --> 00:05:56,623
when he was killed.

79
00:05:56,663 --> 00:05:58,965
I'm sorry, but you're going
to have to find someone else.

80
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:00,027
I don't belong here

81
00:06:00,071 --> 00:06:01,335
and I'm not about to interfere

82
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:02,969
with events going on
in this universe.

83
00:06:03,046 --> 00:06:05,382
At least let me tell
you about the mission.

84
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:08,484
Then, if you decide not to help,
I'll send you home.

85
00:06:11,702 --> 00:06:15,508
There's a Terran scientist
working for the Alliance.

86
00:06:15,545 --> 00:06:18,849
Our sources tell us
she's close to completing

87
00:06:18,886 --> 00:06:23,296
a new transpectral sensor array
that will allow the Alliance

88
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:25,461
to locate our bases
in the Badlands.

89
00:06:25,504 --> 00:06:28,501
Without a safe place to hide,
the Alliance will be able

90
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:30,641
to track us down
and kill us all.

91
00:06:30,684 --> 00:06:33,817
So, you want me
to prevent this scientist

92
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:36,058
from finishing her project?

93
00:06:36,098 --> 00:06:38,866
Captain Sisko was convinced
he could change her mind...

94
00:06:38,905 --> 00:06:40,603
get her to work for us instead.

95
00:06:40,643 --> 00:06:42,546
How did he plan to do that?

96
00:06:42,581 --> 00:06:44,381
She was his wife.

97
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,075
Jennifer.

98
00:06:58,356 --> 00:07:00,156
You know her?

99
00:07:00,194 --> 00:07:02,165
She was my wife, too

100
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,264
but, in my universe,
she's dead.

101
00:07:05,307 --> 00:07:08,713
Not here she isn't...
not yet, anyway.

102
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,550
What do you mean "not yet"?

103
00:07:10,588 --> 00:07:13,790
Unless you can persuade
Professor Sisko

104
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:15,264
to join our cause

105
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:16,632
we'll have no choice
but to kill her.

106
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,003
Kill her?

107
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,071
We cannot let her finish
the sensor array.

108
00:07:21,115 --> 00:07:22,983
It'd mean the end
of the rebellion.

109
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:30,229
I can't let her die...

110
00:07:30,272 --> 00:07:32,710
not again.

111
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:35,479
You're the only one
who can save her.

112
00:07:52,028 --> 00:07:55,902
Mmm. Delectable.

113
00:08:00,383 --> 00:08:01,545
And so are you.

114
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,252
Enter.

115
00:08:09,474 --> 00:08:12,072
Mr. Garak said
you wanted to see me.

116
00:08:12,114 --> 00:08:14,176
Yes.

117
00:08:15,957 --> 00:08:18,954
Come.

118
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,730
Join us.

119
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,470
If you're wondering
when the new sensor array

120
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,538
will be finished,
the answer is...

121
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,213
"As soon as possible."

122
00:08:27,253 --> 00:08:28,552
I know.

123
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,220
Will that be all?

124
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:32,357
I have to get back to work.

125
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,933
I have news of your husband.

126
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:41,185
Nothing you could tell me
about Ben would interest me.

127
00:08:41,223 --> 00:08:43,491
I haven't even seen him
in five years.

128
00:08:43,528 --> 00:08:45,158
Oh, I know that

129
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,903
and I hope that will make this
easier for you.

130
00:08:48,943 --> 00:08:50,344
You see...

131
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:55,157
Benjamin is dead.

132
00:08:57,999 --> 00:08:59,629
Can I go now?

133
00:09:03,514 --> 00:09:06,682
You must have
loved him very much

134
00:09:06,722 --> 00:09:10,220
to be so angry with him,
to become so cold.

135
00:09:10,265 --> 00:09:14,002
Were there other Terrans
killed with him?

136
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:17,915
Oh, a whole ship full.

137
00:09:17,951 --> 00:09:20,423
All of this killing...
it has to stop.

138
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,486
Mmm.

139
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,125
And it will.

140
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:26,833
As soon as you complete
your transpectral sensors

141
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,937
we'll be able locate
the rebel bases

142
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,179
disarm them

143
00:09:31,219 --> 00:09:35,025
and put an end
to all this bloodshed

144
00:09:35,063 --> 00:09:39,336
and I will be able to resume
pressing the Alliance

145
00:09:39,374 --> 00:09:44,753
to become more reasonable
to its Terran population.

146
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:53,141
You do believe me, don't you?

147
00:10:06,744 --> 00:10:07,713
So it's agreed.

148
00:10:07,747 --> 00:10:09,650
I help you get Jennifer
away from the Alliance

149
00:10:09,686 --> 00:10:10,746
and then you get me home.

150
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:13,159
You get us Jennifer,
you can have anything you want.

151
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:16,431
I just hope you can convince her
to leave Terok Nor.

152
00:10:16,537 --> 00:10:18,235
I don't understand
what Jennifer is doing

153
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:19,939
helping the Alliance
in the first place.

154
00:10:19,979 --> 00:10:21,278
I mean, didn't she know

155
00:10:21,316 --> 00:10:23,412
that Sisko was leading
the rebellion?

156
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:25,689
She knew, all right.

157
00:10:25,728 --> 00:10:27,254
The truth is,
she and Captain Sisko

158
00:10:27,298 --> 00:10:28,460
didn't get along too well.

159
00:10:28,534 --> 00:10:30,129
Then again, the Captain
didn't really

160
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:31,300
get along with anyone.

161
00:10:31,342 --> 00:10:34,144
In some ways, the rebellion's
better off without him.

162
00:10:34,182 --> 00:10:35,982
Don't get me wrong.

163
00:10:36,021 --> 00:10:37,081
The Captain knew how to fight.

164
00:10:37,124 --> 00:10:39,528
But that's about all he knew.

165
00:10:40,532 --> 00:10:41,831
Ready?

166
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:43,806
You don't look
very confident, Chief.

167
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,504
Well, you better start
calling me "Smiley."

168
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:46,878
That's what the Captain
called me.

169
00:10:46,915 --> 00:10:50,356
All right, Smiley.

170
00:10:51,928 --> 00:10:54,902
I just wish we had more
time to get you ready.

171
00:10:54,936 --> 00:10:57,842
I probably haven't told you
half of what you need to know.

172
00:10:57,877 --> 00:11:00,976
I hope you don't run up
against too many surprises.

173
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:06,557
If I do, I guess I'll
just have to improvise.

174
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:21,769
I told Sisko he'd never
get close to Terok Nor

175
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,278
and I was right.

176
00:11:24,312 --> 00:11:26,374
I say we teach
the Alliance a lesson...

177
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,322
throw everything
we've got at Terok Nor

178
00:11:28,357 --> 00:11:29,417
and rip it to pieces.

179
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:31,089
I disagree.

180
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,497
Following your suggestion

181
00:11:32,534 --> 00:11:34,528
would do nothing
to enhance our goals

182
00:11:34,573 --> 00:11:36,124
and would result
in a significant loss of life.

183
00:11:36,257 --> 00:11:37,624
That's easy for you to say.

184
00:11:37,661 --> 00:11:39,895
Those Cardassian pigs
didn't kill your brother.

185
00:11:39,934 --> 00:11:42,736
We've all suffered losses
at the hands of the Alliance.

186
00:11:42,775 --> 00:11:44,712
Nonetheless,
logic dictates caution

187
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,546
in the face of a superior enemy.

188
00:11:46,585 --> 00:11:49,149
Logic isn't going
to win us our freedom.

189
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:50,160
We have to take action.

190
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:52,597
And we will.

191
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:55,162
But this time, we do it my way.

192
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:56,973
And what do you propose we do?

193
00:11:57,011 --> 00:11:59,643
We smuggle explosives
aboard the station

194
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:03,822
plant them in her quarters
and detonate them.

195
00:12:03,862 --> 00:12:05,833
You realize it is
highly unlikely

196
00:12:05,868 --> 00:12:08,340
that anyone assigned to such
a mission would survive.

197
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,474
I say it's worth the risk.

198
00:12:11,516 --> 00:12:14,854
Does that mean
you're volunteering for the job?

199
00:12:18,366 --> 00:12:19,335
Captain, you're alive.

200
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:20,429
Of course he's alive.

201
00:12:20,472 --> 00:12:22,306
You can't kill the Captain.

202
00:12:22,344 --> 00:12:23,506
He's too ornery.

203
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:27,044
I hope that doesn't
disappoint anyone.

204
00:12:29,462 --> 00:12:32,664
We're glad you're all right.

205
00:12:32,704 --> 00:12:34,903
I'm sure you are.

206
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,472
We heard your fighter
was destroyed.

207
00:12:37,516 --> 00:12:39,453
The Alliance said you were dead.

208
00:12:39,488 --> 00:12:43,591
Just their propaganda
machine working overtime.

209
00:12:43,632 --> 00:12:46,606
But you know what
all that tells me?

210
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:49,235
They're scared.

211
00:12:51,152 --> 00:12:53,248
And we're going to give them

212
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:56,195
plenty of reason to stay...
scared.

213
00:12:57,301 --> 00:13:00,503
Well, well, well...

214
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,981
it's about time you came back.

215
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:11,903
That's to let you
know I missed you.

216
00:13:13,811 --> 00:13:16,147
And that's for letting
me think you were dead.

217
00:13:16,184 --> 00:13:18,554
I'm glad to see you still care.

218
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,493
You coming or not?

219
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:25,196
I thought you told me
I was married.

220
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,678
Well, you are, technically

221
00:13:27,713 --> 00:13:28,875
but she's your mistress.

222
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,320
I see what you meant
by surprises.

223
00:13:41,315 --> 00:13:43,913
I'm really glad you're alive.

224
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:02,503
And I'm going to make you
glad you're alive.

225
00:14:04,107 --> 00:14:06,636
We have a lot of planning to do.

226
00:14:06,682 --> 00:14:09,314
It can wait.

227
00:14:12,897 --> 00:14:14,868
I suppose it can at that.

228
00:14:19,816 --> 00:14:22,015
Well, these progress
reports are unacceptable.

229
00:14:22,054 --> 00:14:24,856
Productivity
in the ore processing center

230
00:14:24,895 --> 00:14:26,525
is down 15 percent.

231
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,126
You have got to do better.

232
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,196
Or are you purposely

233
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,370
trying to make me look
bad to Sector Command?

234
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,381
Not at all!

235
00:14:32,415 --> 00:14:34,113
I've done everything
I can think of

236
00:14:34,152 --> 00:14:35,314
to motivate the workers.

237
00:14:35,355 --> 00:14:36,324
Such as?

238
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:37,988
Bribes, uh, torture...

239
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,001
I've even given
overseers permission

240
00:14:40,035 --> 00:14:42,029
to execute any worker
not meeting the quota.

241
00:14:42,073 --> 00:14:45,070
Well, I'm sure that
pleases the overseers

242
00:14:45,114 --> 00:14:47,552
but it is not
getting the job done.

243
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:48,578
Follow me.

244
00:14:54,973 --> 00:14:59,144
Let's start with, uh...
him, him and her.

245
00:14:59,184 --> 00:15:00,244
And do what?

246
00:15:00,287 --> 00:15:01,620
Execute them.

247
00:15:01,657 --> 00:15:04,391
I think you'll find that random
and unprovoked executions

248
00:15:04,465 --> 00:15:06,801
will keep your workforce
alert and motivated.

249
00:15:06,838 --> 00:15:09,778
I bow to your brilliance.

250
00:15:11,483 --> 00:15:12,679
Let's go.

251
00:15:12,719 --> 00:15:13,710
You, too.

252
00:15:15,292 --> 00:15:17,992
Though I do hope
your mood improves

253
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:19,559
before we run out of workers.

254
00:15:19,604 --> 00:15:21,906
What does my mood have
to do with anything?

255
00:15:21,943 --> 00:15:25,281
If you don't mind my saying,
I have noticed a certain amount

256
00:15:25,318 --> 00:15:27,152
of ill humor
on your part lately.

257
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,594
I don't know
what you're talking about.

258
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,726
As I recall,
it began about the time

259
00:15:31,768 --> 00:15:33,967
you learned
of Captain Sisko's death.

260
00:15:34,008 --> 00:15:36,880
Now, why would I be upset
by such delightful news?

261
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,317
Well, I was

262
00:15:38,352 --> 00:15:41,850
under the impression that you
were rather fond of him.

263
00:15:41,895 --> 00:15:43,866
Well, then you were mistaken.

264
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,392
Well, I will say this for him...

265
00:15:45,437 --> 00:15:47,807
he did have spirit.

266
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:52,287
Too much spirit can be
a dangerous thing.

267
00:15:52,322 --> 00:15:55,626
Tends to... infect others.

268
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:57,224
Well, that's something

269
00:15:57,268 --> 00:16:00,070
we won't have to worry
about, at least.

270
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:02,604
With Sisko's death
and the imminent completion

271
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:05,247
of the transpectral
sensor array, the rebellion

272
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:07,385
is certain to collapse.

273
00:16:07,427 --> 00:16:09,364
You seem very sure of yourself.

274
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,333
I am.

275
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,340
I'll remember that.

276
00:16:12,374 --> 00:16:15,678
If the rebellion continues,
I'll know who to blame.

277
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,785
Are you sure these Alliance
patrol patterns are accurate?

278
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,388
You tell me.
You gathered the information.

279
00:16:34,432 --> 00:16:36,096
Hmm?

280
00:16:37,773 --> 00:16:39,037
Oh, that's right.

281
00:16:39,077 --> 00:16:40,239
Are you okay?

282
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,251
You seem a little distracted.

283
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:43,413
Just thinking.

284
00:16:43,455 --> 00:16:45,426
I've been thinking, too.

285
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,260
You know we've been fighting
against the Alliance

286
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,030
for almost a year now.

287
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:51,975
And what has it gotten us?

288
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,879
Nothing.

289
00:16:53,915 --> 00:16:55,475
Sometimes I think
we were better off

290
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,855
when we were collecting
tribute for the Intendant.

291
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,556
Those days are gone.

292
00:16:59,597 --> 00:17:03,198
Maybe... but I'm tired
of living like this.

293
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,008
The rebellion's a lost cause
and we both know it.

294
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,519
Don't you want to see
the Terrans gain their freedom?

295
00:17:08,553 --> 00:17:11,025
Have you taken a good look
at your troops lately?

296
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,932
They're nothing but ex-slaves
with delusions of grandeur.

297
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:17,431
They'll never overthrow
the Alliance.

298
00:17:17,476 --> 00:17:19,914
Let's just get a ship and go.

299
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:22,079
Forget all about the rebellion.

300
00:17:22,122 --> 00:17:25,153
I'm not ready
to give up just yet.

301
00:17:25,197 --> 00:17:28,194
It's not like you're going
to have much choice.

302
00:17:29,207 --> 00:17:30,871
Once that witch you married

303
00:17:30,911 --> 00:17:32,643
finishes
her new sensor array

304
00:17:32,716 --> 00:17:36,054
Alliance ships are going
to be all over these Badlands.

305
00:17:36,091 --> 00:17:38,655
We're going to have
no place to hide.

306
00:17:38,698 --> 00:17:43,108
Then I guess we'll just have
to make sure she doesn't finish.

307
00:17:46,151 --> 00:17:50,994
Trying to reach Terok Nor
using small fighters didn't work

308
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,160
but we need to get
Jennifer off that station

309
00:17:53,202 --> 00:17:55,366
and we need to get
her off there soon!

310
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:59,214
We have been meaning
to talk to you about that.

311
00:17:59,251 --> 00:18:00,983
Mr. Bashir is not convinced

312
00:18:01,023 --> 00:18:02,926
that you can persuade
your former mate

313
00:18:02,961 --> 00:18:03,930
to join our cause.

314
00:18:03,964 --> 00:18:07,336
I can be very persuasive.

315
00:18:07,372 --> 00:18:08,864
Look!

316
00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:11,279
I don't even know why we're
bothering to discuss this.

317
00:18:11,316 --> 00:18:13,310
The Cardassians
destroyed your ship

318
00:18:13,355 --> 00:18:15,383
way before it got even
close to Terok Nor...

319
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,396
Hit him.

320
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,864
That's what the Captain
would do.

321
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,096
Go on, hit him!

322
00:18:19,136 --> 00:18:20,400
...convince your wife
of anything!

323
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,989
Let's face it, Captain,
the woman hates you.

324
00:18:30,575 --> 00:18:35,282
What my wife thinks of me
is none of your concern.

325
00:18:35,321 --> 00:18:38,261
Anyone else want to disagree
with the Captain?

326
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,430
Put it away, Dax.

327
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,100
Go on!

328
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:45,044
Put it away!

329
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:51,820
No one is questioning
your authority, Captain

330
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,994
but we have to stop her

331
00:18:54,036 --> 00:18:56,166
before she finishes
the sensor array.

332
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,236
And there's only one
sure way to do that.

333
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:02,245
We have to kill her.

334
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:05,197
You've been saying
that all along.

335
00:19:05,231 --> 00:19:08,866
Well, maybe it's time...
he listened.

336
00:19:08,908 --> 00:19:10,742
Killing her would
be a lot easier

337
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:13,115
than trying to get her
away from the Alliance.

338
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,123
Easier, but not smarter.

339
00:19:15,157 --> 00:19:17,425
If she's that important
to the Alliance

340
00:19:17,463 --> 00:19:19,491
think how important
she could be to us.

341
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:23,774
We could use a scientist
on our side.

342
00:19:23,813 --> 00:19:24,941
You tell them, Smiley.

343
00:19:24,983 --> 00:19:27,079
At least someone here
is using his brain.

344
00:19:27,121 --> 00:19:28,556
Oh, think about it.

345
00:19:28,593 --> 00:19:31,863
Who knows what other weapons
the Alliance is developing?

346
00:19:31,901 --> 00:19:33,838
Someone like Professor Sisko

347
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:37,005
could counteract anything
they come up with.

348
00:19:37,047 --> 00:19:39,383
She's valuable.

349
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,015
We need her!

350
00:19:41,058 --> 00:19:43,553
All right...

351
00:19:46,305 --> 00:19:48,971
does anyone disagree?

352
00:19:52,554 --> 00:19:54,023
Good.

353
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:56,086
Now let's get to work.

354
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:08,923
Tell the Intendant
what you told me.

355
00:20:12,072 --> 00:20:13,736
It's about Captain Sisko.

356
00:20:13,776 --> 00:20:15,006
Sisko?

357
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:16,379
He's alive.

358
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,444
He was able to get off his ship
before it exploded.

359
00:20:20,627 --> 00:20:23,965
I suppose it's possible.

360
00:20:24,002 --> 00:20:26,338
It's more than possible.
It's true.

361
00:20:26,376 --> 00:20:30,683
But I can tell you how
to get your hands on him...

362
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,420
if you're interested.

363
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,895
Ah.

364
00:20:44,689 --> 00:20:46,319
Don't do that.

365
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:50,133
Can't help it... it itches.

366
00:20:52,075 --> 00:20:53,739
I hope this works.

367
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,150
It'll work,
just stop scratching.

368
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:03,170
You know, you did
pretty good back there.

369
00:21:03,205 --> 00:21:06,611
I don't think anyone suspected
you weren't Captain Sisko.

370
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:11,420
At least,
not once you hit Bashir.

371
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:15,593
But you and I both know
that was just a warm-up.

372
00:21:15,637 --> 00:21:18,509
Jennifer is the one
I really have to convince.

373
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:21,312
I guess seeing her
isn't going to be easy for you.

374
00:21:21,352 --> 00:21:24,018
How long's it been
since your wife died?

375
00:21:24,058 --> 00:21:25,152
Five years.

376
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:29,033
Well, just remember

377
00:21:29,071 --> 00:21:32,877
Jennifer may look like her,
but she's not.

378
00:21:32,915 --> 00:21:34,749
She's a completely
different person.

379
00:21:34,786 --> 00:21:38,090
I'll try to remember that.

380
00:21:38,129 --> 00:21:40,066
Do you have any idea
what went wrong

381
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,764
between her and Captain Sisko?

382
00:21:41,805 --> 00:21:43,104
From what I heard

383
00:21:43,142 --> 00:21:45,204
they never should have been
together in the first place.

384
00:21:45,247 --> 00:21:48,585
She came from one of the few
privileged Terran families.

385
00:21:48,622 --> 00:21:51,322
People who cooperated
with the Alliance.

386
00:21:51,363 --> 00:21:53,527
The Captain fought his way up
from the mines.

387
00:21:53,568 --> 00:21:55,368
What is she like, this Jennifer?

388
00:21:55,406 --> 00:21:57,104
I don't know.

389
00:21:57,144 --> 00:22:00,312
They'd separated by the time
I got to know the Captain.

390
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:02,324
What was your Jennifer like?

391
00:22:03,962 --> 00:22:07,266
She was the kindest,
most caring person I ever knew.

392
00:22:09,477 --> 00:22:11,881
I wouldn't get my hopes up.

393
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,476
Oh.

394
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,057
Hold on.

395
00:22:17,163 --> 00:22:20,627
I'm reading a slight energy
distortion in subspace.

396
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,040
What are the coordinates?

397
00:22:22,076 --> 00:22:23,671
It's coming from all around us.

398
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,646
You know, Captain Sisko

399
00:22:37,683 --> 00:22:39,985
would try to fight
his way out of this.

400
00:22:40,023 --> 00:22:42,587
Be glad I'm not him.

401
00:22:48,478 --> 00:22:50,004
Well...

402
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:52,783
if it isn't
the notorious Captain Sisko

403
00:22:52,822 --> 00:22:54,952
and his friend, the Tinkerer.

404
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,708
I'm glad to see you,
too, Intendant.

405
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,294
Still the same old Benjamin.

406
00:23:10,101 --> 00:23:12,095
You wouldn't have it
any other way.

407
00:23:12,139 --> 00:23:13,108
Um, perhaps not

408
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,440
but I'm still going to kill you.

409
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:16,643
Maybe, but not right away.

410
00:23:16,684 --> 00:23:18,621
You flatter yourself.

411
00:23:18,656 --> 00:23:21,528
Not unjustly, I hope.

412
00:23:21,564 --> 00:23:22,794
Intendant!

413
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,706
Please, let me teach him
some manners.

414
00:23:25,741 --> 00:23:27,975
All in good time.

415
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,656
But first...

416
00:23:33,695 --> 00:23:38,834
whatever shall we do
about O'Brien?

417
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:41,975
I remember the first time
I saw you, Tinkerer

418
00:23:42,017 --> 00:23:43,316
you were fixing something.

419
00:23:43,354 --> 00:23:46,192
You were always fixing things,
making things better

420
00:23:46,227 --> 00:23:48,061
and everyone loved you for it.

421
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:49,329
Even me.

422
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:52,810
But that just wasn't
enough for you, was it?

423
00:23:52,845 --> 00:23:56,115
You couldn't be happy
staying here, being loved.

424
00:23:56,153 --> 00:23:58,317
You had to lash out
and betray everyone

425
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:00,125
who was ever good to you.

426
00:24:00,164 --> 00:24:01,463
Why?

427
00:24:03,606 --> 00:24:05,668
I wanted to be free.

428
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:08,047
Free.

429
00:24:09,321 --> 00:24:11,189
You're a Terran.

430
00:24:11,225 --> 00:24:13,093
You were born a slave,
and you'll die a slave.

431
00:24:13,164 --> 00:24:16,297
Take him to ore processing.

432
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:19,073
Remind him where he belongs.

433
00:24:19,113 --> 00:24:20,377
And what about Sisko?

434
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:23,288
Take me
to the Intendant's quarters.

435
00:24:23,324 --> 00:24:26,024
Then she'll decide
what do with me.

436
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:27,728
Of all the impudent!

437
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:30,241
Do as he says.

438
00:24:30,275 --> 00:24:32,975
Intendant, I demand
that this man be...

439
00:24:33,016 --> 00:24:33,985
Ooh!

440
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:37,255
You... demand?

441
00:24:37,293 --> 00:24:40,597
You promised me he'd die.

442
00:24:40,635 --> 00:24:44,338
And he will...
when I say...

443
00:24:44,378 --> 00:24:46,612
and not a moment before.

444
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,677
Shall we?

445
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:49,453
After you.

446
00:24:57,847 --> 00:25:01,812
I really don't know
what to do with you.

447
00:25:01,857 --> 00:25:03,487
I sympathize.

448
00:25:03,528 --> 00:25:05,396
It's a difficult decision

449
00:25:05,433 --> 00:25:09,273
but I'm sure you'll
come up with something.

450
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,805
The only reason I can think of

451
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:14,618
to keep you alive
is to infuriate Garak.

452
00:25:14,657 --> 00:25:16,594
What better reason do you need?

453
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,589
Well, suppose...

454
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:25,092
I let you live.

455
00:25:25,129 --> 00:25:26,155
Hmm?

456
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:31,208
What will I get in return?

457
00:25:31,245 --> 00:25:33,615
What do you want?

458
00:25:34,988 --> 00:25:37,050
Your loyalty.

459
00:25:37,093 --> 00:25:39,189
That's all I've ever wanted.

460
00:25:40,502 --> 00:25:44,000
For you to be at my side,
my strong right arm.

461
00:25:44,045 --> 00:25:48,250
But I'm afraid I can
never trust you again.

462
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:51,992
Which means...
that I will have

463
00:25:52,032 --> 00:25:55,530
to dispose of you eventually.

464
00:25:55,575 --> 00:26:01,615
The question is should
it be sooner or later?

465
00:26:01,657 --> 00:26:03,355
Do I get a vote?

466
00:26:03,394 --> 00:26:05,730
Of course you do.

467
00:26:05,768 --> 00:26:07,739
It just doesn't count.

468
00:26:13,187 --> 00:26:14,383
No.

469
00:26:15,527 --> 00:26:17,863
I've got to think about this.

470
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,566
You will let me know
what you decide.

471
00:26:20,606 --> 00:26:24,378
I wouldn't dream
of keeping it a secret.

472
00:26:27,224 --> 00:26:28,922
Hmm.

473
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:45,896
Jennifer.

474
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,602
Hello, Ben.

475
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:52,213
Please, leave us.

476
00:26:52,255 --> 00:26:56,163
What, and miss this
touching reunion?

477
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:57,293
You heard her.

478
00:26:57,335 --> 00:26:59,272
If you need anyone

479
00:26:59,307 --> 00:27:00,833
to beat him
into submission for you

480
00:27:00,877 --> 00:27:03,874
please don't hesitate
to call me.

481
00:27:10,937 --> 00:27:13,205
All right, I'm here.

482
00:27:13,243 --> 00:27:14,735
What did you want
to see me about?

483
00:27:14,847 --> 00:27:17,581
I was hoping we could talk.

484
00:27:17,621 --> 00:27:19,957
Really?
You never seemed interested

485
00:27:19,994 --> 00:27:22,660
in talking to me
while we were married.

486
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,170
I made a lot of mistakes
back then.

487
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,308
Save the apologies, Ben.

488
00:27:29,352 --> 00:27:30,878
They're not going to work.

489
00:27:30,922 --> 00:27:34,021
You are, without a doubt

490
00:27:34,063 --> 00:27:38,564
the most insensitive,
self-absorbed, egotistical...

491
00:27:38,609 --> 00:27:39,805
You've made your point.

492
00:27:39,879 --> 00:27:41,314
I doubt it.

493
00:27:41,349 --> 00:27:43,115
You never listened to me before.

494
00:27:43,154 --> 00:27:45,250
You were always too busy
trying to impress

495
00:27:45,292 --> 00:27:46,990
every woman
who crossed your path.

496
00:27:47,031 --> 00:27:49,435
Were there really that many?

497
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,837
There were enough.

498
00:27:50,874 --> 00:27:55,011
And if it wasn't women,
then it was that ship of yours.

499
00:27:55,052 --> 00:27:59,189
Sometimes I think it was
the only thing you ever loved.

500
00:27:59,228 --> 00:28:01,324
Maybe I loved you both.

501
00:28:01,368 --> 00:28:03,305
Then why did you leave me

502
00:28:03,339 --> 00:28:06,711
to go run and play pirate
for the Intendant?

503
00:28:06,748 --> 00:28:10,246
That's a good question.

504
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:16,469
Now this rebellion of yours.

505
00:28:19,482 --> 00:28:21,954
Do you know
how many deaths you've caused?

506
00:28:21,988 --> 00:28:24,620
How much destruction?

507
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,860
I'm fighting
to help free our people.

508
00:28:26,901 --> 00:28:28,200
You're fighting

509
00:28:28,238 --> 00:28:30,106
because you like to fight,
Benjamin.

510
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:31,703
The only thing
you've accomplished

511
00:28:31,746 --> 00:28:33,272
is to give the Alliance
an excuse

512
00:28:33,317 --> 00:28:35,755
to treat the Terrans
worse than before.

513
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:38,992
I just hope that,
with your capture

514
00:28:39,032 --> 00:28:41,561
this rebellion
can be ended peacefully.

515
00:28:41,605 --> 00:28:43,097
Who said I'd been captured?

516
00:28:43,143 --> 00:28:45,615
Oh, I suppose you came here
just to see me.

517
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:49,490
Actually, I came here
to rescue you.

518
00:28:55,976 --> 00:28:57,206
Rescue me?

519
00:28:57,246 --> 00:28:58,613
That's what I said.

520
00:28:58,649 --> 00:29:00,415
I'm not going anywhere with you.

521
00:29:00,454 --> 00:29:01,718
You can't stay here.

522
00:29:01,757 --> 00:29:03,226
I have a job to finish.

523
00:29:03,262 --> 00:29:04,595
You mean the sensor array?

524
00:29:04,632 --> 00:29:06,033
That's right.

525
00:29:06,069 --> 00:29:07,629
If you finish the array,
you'll destroy

526
00:29:07,673 --> 00:29:09,507
any hope our people have
for a better future.

527
00:29:09,545 --> 00:29:10,707
I don't think you want that.

528
00:29:10,748 --> 00:29:14,554
All I want to do is put an end
to all this fighting

529
00:29:14,591 --> 00:29:16,927
to force the rebels to seek
a peaceful settlement

530
00:29:17,031 --> 00:29:18,330
with the Alliance.

531
00:29:18,368 --> 00:29:19,894
It's not that simple.

532
00:29:19,938 --> 00:29:22,502
The Alliance isn't interested
in a peaceful settlement.

533
00:29:22,545 --> 00:29:24,675
If we lay down our arms,
we'll all be killed.

534
00:29:24,717 --> 00:29:27,246
The rebellion
is killing people every day.

535
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:28,955
It has to stop.

536
00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:30,589
Not this way.

537
00:29:30,632 --> 00:29:33,230
Not while the Terrans are still
at the mercy of the Alliance.

538
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:37,147
They're your own people,
Jennifer.

539
00:29:37,183 --> 00:29:39,211
You have no right
to talk to me like that.

540
00:29:39,255 --> 00:29:42,229
Since when do you care about
what happens to our people?

541
00:29:42,263 --> 00:29:45,237
You've never cared about anyone
but yourself.

542
00:29:47,142 --> 00:29:50,241
Maybe I've changed
in the past few years.

543
00:29:50,284 --> 00:29:54,421
Oh, how many times
have I heard you say that?

544
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,062
I guess I was
a pretty lousy husband.

545
00:30:10,136 --> 00:30:13,008
You guess?

546
00:30:13,042 --> 00:30:15,514
Look, I know it's too late
for an apology.

547
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:17,452
You're right about that.

548
00:30:17,487 --> 00:30:19,823
But for what it's worth...

549
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,455
I'm sorry.

550
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:24,937
What is it?

551
00:30:26,277 --> 00:30:30,117
For a second,
I almost believed you.

552
00:30:33,663 --> 00:30:35,566
You know what I wish?

553
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:38,439
I wish I'd never met you.

554
00:30:38,476 --> 00:30:42,441
And I wish things could have
been better between us

555
00:30:42,486 --> 00:30:47,021
but this isn't about us...

556
00:30:47,065 --> 00:30:48,660
or is it?

557
00:30:48,702 --> 00:30:52,269
Why are you working
for the Alliance?

558
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:54,613
Is it because you believe
in what they're doing

559
00:30:54,651 --> 00:30:55,847
or is it something else?

560
00:30:55,888 --> 00:30:59,694
I don't know
what you're talking about.

561
00:30:59,731 --> 00:31:03,332
I think the two of us have been
fighting each other so long

562
00:31:03,374 --> 00:31:07,043
that you've gotten used to us
being on opposite sides

563
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:11,493
but I'm not the enemy
this time, Jennifer.

564
00:31:11,528 --> 00:31:12,827
The Alliance is.

565
00:31:12,865 --> 00:31:15,463
The Alliance is your enemy,
not mine.

566
00:31:15,505 --> 00:31:17,135
That's where you're wrong.

567
00:31:17,176 --> 00:31:18,702
Don't you see?

568
00:31:18,746 --> 00:31:20,614
You're no different
than the slaves

569
00:31:20,651 --> 00:31:22,679
working
in the ore processing center.

570
00:31:22,724 --> 00:31:25,026
In fact, you may
even be worse off.

571
00:31:25,063 --> 00:31:27,467
At least they know
they're prisoners.

572
00:31:27,502 --> 00:31:29,666
What if I am a prisoner?

573
00:31:29,709 --> 00:31:30,905
You don't have to be.

574
00:31:30,945 --> 00:31:32,916
Fight back.

575
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,112
Come with me.

576
00:31:34,153 --> 00:31:36,215
You want me to join
the rebellion?

577
00:31:36,325 --> 00:31:37,624
The way I see it

578
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:41,195
freedom is a whole lot better
than slavery.

579
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,215
Think about it.

580
00:31:55,442 --> 00:31:56,934
Took him long enough.

581
00:31:58,282 --> 00:31:59,717
What are you doing?

582
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:01,279
Sending a message.

583
00:32:01,323 --> 00:32:03,191
You have a subdermal
communicator?

584
00:32:03,228 --> 00:32:06,134
Courtesy of the Ferengi.

585
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,843
Jennifer, I need an answer!

586
00:32:51,952 --> 00:32:54,116
Are you coming with me or not?

587
00:32:55,761 --> 00:32:57,060
Do I have a choice?

588
00:32:57,098 --> 00:32:59,832
Of course you do.

589
00:32:59,873 --> 00:33:02,003
If you want, you can
go back to your quarters

590
00:33:02,044 --> 00:33:03,708
and forget we ever spoke.

591
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:04,809
It's up to you.

592
00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:08,026
All right

593
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:11,034
but let's get one thing clear.

594
00:33:11,068 --> 00:33:12,264
What's that?

595
00:33:12,305 --> 00:33:13,672
I still hate you.

596
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:15,542
I know.

597
00:33:19,723 --> 00:33:20,953
Terran!

598
00:33:20,993 --> 00:33:22,360
What are you doing down there?

599
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:27,105
I'm rerouting
the central ODN processor.

600
00:33:27,143 --> 00:33:28,977
The Intendant's orders.

601
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:36,495
I don't recall receiving
clearance for any repairs.

602
00:33:39,943 --> 00:33:41,071
You don't say.

603
00:33:46,593 --> 00:33:47,653
Hey!

604
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:52,336
Get him!

605
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:57,588
All right!

606
00:33:57,622 --> 00:34:00,562
Anyone who wants to get
out of here, follow me!

607
00:34:00,597 --> 00:34:01,588
Come on!

608
00:34:04,206 --> 00:34:06,770
You still haven't told me
where we're going.

609
00:34:06,813 --> 00:34:07,907
Airlock 7.

610
00:34:07,948 --> 00:34:09,885
There should be a ship
waiting there for us

611
00:34:09,921 --> 00:34:11,117
providing we can get there

612
00:34:11,158 --> 00:34:13,026
before the security
systems reactivate.

613
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:15,802
Did you look in there?

614
00:34:15,836 --> 00:34:16,827
Get back.

615
00:34:38,294 --> 00:34:39,422
Now what?

616
00:34:39,464 --> 00:34:41,332
Uh, I'll think of something.

617
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,421
Hey!

618
00:34:56,508 --> 00:34:57,534
Good work, Smiley.

619
00:34:57,578 --> 00:34:58,547
Yeah, the only problem is

620
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,742
there's 30 more
of them behind us.

621
00:34:59,783 --> 00:35:01,252
Then we better get
to the airlock.

622
00:35:01,288 --> 00:35:02,883
Come on.

623
00:35:11,882 --> 00:35:14,856
Something tells me
that's not part of your plan.

624
00:35:19,935 --> 00:35:22,373
We'd better find
another way out of here.

625
00:35:22,408 --> 00:35:24,744
Got any suggestions?

626
00:35:24,781 --> 00:35:26,513
Fall back!

627
00:35:46,471 --> 00:35:48,101
That was very clever, Benjamin...

628
00:35:48,143 --> 00:35:50,707
having one of your own men
betray you, so you could

629
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:52,048
get aboard the station.

630
00:35:52,086 --> 00:35:53,487
I was completely fooled.

631
00:35:53,523 --> 00:35:55,357
Fortunately, Mr. Garak

632
00:35:55,394 --> 00:35:57,524
is somewhat more cynical
than I am.

633
00:35:57,567 --> 00:36:00,769
Your Ferengi friend
informed us of your entire plan.

634
00:36:00,809 --> 00:36:02,643
With a little persuasion
of course.

635
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,879
I'm afraid there's no escape.

636
00:36:04,919 --> 00:36:06,013
Your ship's locked down.

637
00:36:06,055 --> 00:36:07,422
Your pilot's dead.

638
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:08,951
There's no way out.

639
00:36:08,997 --> 00:36:10,193
You might as well surrender.

640
00:36:10,233 --> 00:36:12,067
If we surrender, she'll kill us.

641
00:36:12,105 --> 00:36:13,267
Maybe us...

642
00:36:13,308 --> 00:36:15,678
but not Jennifer.

643
00:36:15,714 --> 00:36:18,084
What if we offer her a trade?

644
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,284
I stay here
and she lets you live.

645
00:36:20,326 --> 00:36:24,736
Benjamin, you know
how I hate to be kept waiting.

646
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,709
I came a long way
to get you out of here

647
00:36:28,747 --> 00:36:31,983
and I'm not going
to leave without you.

648
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:32,992
What is it?

649
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:34,620
Nothing.

650
00:36:35,632 --> 00:36:38,104
Smiley...

651
00:36:38,138 --> 00:36:40,166
how far is the ore
processing center?

652
00:36:40,211 --> 00:36:41,875
Only a couple of levels.

653
00:36:43,419 --> 00:36:45,948
Time's up, Benjamin.

654
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:54,774
Benjamin!

655
00:36:55,852 --> 00:36:57,344
Pursue!

656
00:37:08,551 --> 00:37:11,684
He always has
to make things difficult.

657
00:37:11,726 --> 00:37:14,392
It's one of his least
endearing qualities.

658
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:36,216
Smiley, seal the door!

659
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:37,988
Sure...

660
00:37:38,027 --> 00:37:39,360
it's easy for you to say.

661
00:37:54,336 --> 00:37:56,034
I'm going to get you
out of here.

662
00:37:56,074 --> 00:37:57,065
I promise.

663
00:37:57,111 --> 00:37:58,706
I believe you.

664
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,441
I don't know
what you're up to, Captain

665
00:38:09,475 --> 00:38:11,035
but there's no way
out of this room

666
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,276
except through that door.

667
00:38:12,317 --> 00:38:14,447
Don't worry, I know
what I'm doing.

668
00:38:14,488 --> 00:38:16,926
I just hope your
Terok Nor was designed

669
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,935
by the same Cardassian
that built my Terok Nor.

670
00:38:21,273 --> 00:38:23,301
Are you sure they're in there?

671
00:38:23,345 --> 00:38:25,475
Good.
Then we've got them.

672
00:38:25,517 --> 00:38:27,647
Use the manual override
to open the doors.

673
00:38:27,689 --> 00:38:29,090
This time, Intendant

674
00:38:29,127 --> 00:38:32,033
I trust you're not
going to be so lenient

675
00:38:32,067 --> 00:38:33,331
on our dear Mr. Sisko.

676
00:38:33,371 --> 00:38:34,704
Don't worry.

677
00:38:34,742 --> 00:38:36,804
He's disappointed me
for the last time.

678
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,090
Oh, Jennifer.

679
00:38:55,161 --> 00:39:00,631
Ah, I was so worried about you

680
00:39:00,675 --> 00:39:02,943
but you're safe now.

681
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,082
In fact...

682
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:09,654
I can assure you

683
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:15,544
that your husband will
never annoy you again.

684
00:39:15,581 --> 00:39:16,914
Actually...

685
00:39:16,951 --> 00:39:18,477
for the first time

686
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:21,792
since I've met him,
he's not annoying me.

687
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:25,294
In fact,
he's making a lot of sense.

688
00:39:29,383 --> 00:39:32,881
Well, he can be very persuasive
when he wants to be.

689
00:39:37,538 --> 00:39:38,973
I suppose this means

690
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:42,073
you won't be finishing
the sensor array.

691
00:39:46,995 --> 00:39:49,297
I'm a Terran.

692
00:39:52,443 --> 00:39:53,639
Keep her alive.

693
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,910
Kill the others.

694
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:55,919
Oh, I wouldn't.

695
00:39:55,952 --> 00:39:57,650
You'd be making a mistake.

696
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:59,320
The only mistake I made

697
00:39:59,361 --> 00:40:01,847
was not executing you
in the first place.

698
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,350
You don't know
how right you are.

699
00:40:04,387 --> 00:40:07,418
I have activated the station's
self-destruct sequence.

700
00:40:07,461 --> 00:40:08,452
Unless I disarm it

701
00:40:08,497 --> 00:40:11,095
this whole place will
blow up in nine minutes.

702
00:40:14,847 --> 00:40:16,545
That's impossible.

703
00:40:16,584 --> 00:40:18,578
There's no way you could know

704
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,858
the station's
command access code.

705
00:40:20,896 --> 00:40:24,497
Alpha-9-1-7-5-blue.

706
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:30,647
Computer, disengage
self-destruct sequence.

707
00:40:30,688 --> 00:40:35,929
Authorization Kira
Alpha-9-1-7-5-blue.

708
00:40:35,968 --> 00:40:39,569
Authorization denied.

709
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:41,080
I changed it.

710
00:40:46,429 --> 00:40:49,927
You have eight minutes
and 30 seconds to let us go.

711
00:40:49,972 --> 00:40:52,810
Otherwise, we all die.

712
00:40:52,845 --> 00:40:54,405
Don't listen to him.

713
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:55,441
He's bluffing.

714
00:41:00,633 --> 00:41:01,693
He's not bluffing.

715
00:41:01,735 --> 00:41:03,034
How do you know?

716
00:41:03,073 --> 00:41:04,064
I know.

717
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:10,148
Give me the new access code...

718
00:41:10,191 --> 00:41:12,459
and I'll let you go.

719
00:41:12,497 --> 00:41:15,596
I will give you the access code
once my friends and I

720
00:41:15,638 --> 00:41:18,737
are safely away
from the station.

721
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:21,048
Do we have a deal?

722
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:26,226
This isn't over, Benjamin.

723
00:41:26,266 --> 00:41:28,795
I'll hunt you down.

724
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:31,209
I swear it.

725
00:41:32,248 --> 00:41:35,245
You're welcome to try.

726
00:42:06,002 --> 00:42:07,232
Well, I'm glad to see

727
00:42:07,272 --> 00:42:08,798
the two of you
are getting along.

728
00:42:08,843 --> 00:42:10,711
We have a lot in common.

729
00:42:10,748 --> 00:42:12,308
He's all yours.

730
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,705
Dax tells me you're leaving.

731
00:42:21,743 --> 00:42:25,241
I thought I'd pay
the Romulans a visit

732
00:42:25,286 --> 00:42:27,485
see if I can convince
them to help us.

733
00:42:29,362 --> 00:42:32,997
Then I guess this is good-bye.

734
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:35,341
Jennifer...

735
00:42:35,378 --> 00:42:38,318
there's so much
I want to tell you.

736
00:42:38,353 --> 00:42:41,087
I just don't know
where to start.

737
00:42:41,126 --> 00:42:42,721
Why don't you start

738
00:42:42,764 --> 00:42:46,365
by telling me
what happened to my husband.

739
00:42:53,225 --> 00:42:55,025
He's dead, isn't he?

740
00:42:55,063 --> 00:42:57,399
I'm sorry.

741
00:42:57,435 --> 00:42:59,167
Don't be.

742
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,475
Who are you...

743
00:43:03,518 --> 00:43:05,352
really?

744
00:43:08,096 --> 00:43:10,864
It's a long story.

745
00:43:10,904 --> 00:43:13,308
But ask Smiley.

746
00:43:13,344 --> 00:43:16,112
He can fill you in
on the details.

747
00:43:16,151 --> 00:43:18,555
He seems like a good man.

748
00:43:19,627 --> 00:43:21,291
He does at that.

749
00:43:22,668 --> 00:43:24,536
So...

750
00:43:24,573 --> 00:43:26,567
what are you going to do now?

751
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:33,823
Oh, I'm sure Smiley will find
something to keep me busy.

752
00:43:37,774 --> 00:43:41,272
You're not really going to visit
the Romulans, are you?

753
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:45,285
The deal was that I get you
off the station

754
00:43:45,327 --> 00:43:47,993
and then I go home.

755
00:43:50,173 --> 00:43:52,441
Will I see you again?

756
00:43:52,478 --> 00:43:54,073
I don't know.

757
00:43:58,962 --> 00:44:03,201
Thank you for rescuing me.

758
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:05,039
It was my pleasure.

759
00:44:07,818 --> 00:44:09,812
Ready, Captain?

760
00:44:15,271 --> 00:44:16,866
You'd better go.

761
00:44:19,616 --> 00:44:21,780
Take me home, Smiley.
