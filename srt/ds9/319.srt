1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,010
I found 27 voles
in his storeroom.

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,054
Vole infestations are not
uncommon on this station.

3
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:15,098
If you don't believe me,
ask Chief O'Brien.

4
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,976
When I came in,
he and Morn

5
00:00:16,976 --> 00:00:20,103
were painting numbers
on the voles' backs.

6
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:25,442
We were just... counting them
to see how many we'd caught.

7
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,736
You were getting ready
to stage a vole fight.

8
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,947
A vole fight?

9
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,073
I'm appalled.

10
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,618
Do you really think that was
what Morn was up to?

11
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:37,287
Constable, I want the voles
confiscated

12
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,706
and removed from the station.

13
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:41,124
You can't confiscate
Morn's voles.

14
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,668
They're like his pets.

15
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:45,337
I'll see if I can
get him some goldfish.

16
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:48,423
Now, gentlemen,
if you will excuse me,

17
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,718
it's late.

18
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:53,136
(<i> sighs</i> )
Poor Morn.

19
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,639
This is going
to break his hearts.

20
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:56,932
(<i> snorts</i> )

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,519
Ops is yours,
Lieutenant.

22
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:06,274
You going
somewhere, Chief?

23
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,777
Sir, I need to talk to you.

24
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,738
It's kind of
private.

25
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,865
We were just leaving.
Come on.

26
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:15,367
Let's go break
the news to Morn.

27
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,494
Do you want to talk
in my office?

28
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,580
Actually, I thought
we might go to my place.

29
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,956
Commander!

30
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,000
Stand down.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,126
Get on the
transporter pad.

32
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,378
Move!

33
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,902
Computer...

34
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,238
energize on my command.

35
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,329
Energize.

36
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,052
Where are we?

37
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:18,597
I guess you could say
we just stepped through
the looking glass.

38
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,515
Sit down, make
yourself comfortable.

39
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,102
Right now, I'm not
feeling very comfortable.

40
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:29,269
(<i> groaning</i> )

41
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,690
There, that's better.

42
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,361
That was a pretty nice move.

43
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,905
I'm glad you liked it.

44
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,907
Of course, it doesn't
change anything.

45
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,993
You can't go home
unless I reconfigure
the transporter,

46
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,412
and I'm not about
to do that.

47
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,958
I guess you have
a lot of questions.

48
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,001
Not as many as you think.

49
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,712
You know where we are?
If I had to guess,

50
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,339
I'd say that this is
the same parallel universe

51
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,926
that two of my crew members
visited a year ago.

52
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,137
Oh, you're quick...

53
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:04,972
just like our Sisko.

54
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:08,100
That saves me having to
give you a history lesson,

55
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,353
but I better update you
on current events.

56
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:15,857
Since your officers left here,
we've started a rebellion

57
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,193
against the Klingon-
Cardassian alliance.

58
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,279
We're fighting for our lives.

59
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:23,490
I wish you luck, but I don't see
what that has to do with me.

60
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,533
It has everything
to do with you.

61
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,245
<i>You</i> were the leader
of the Terran rebellion.

62
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,705
At least,<i> our</i>
Benjamin Sisko was.

63
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,166
Was?

64
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,002
Captain Sisko's dead.

65
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,711
The Cardassians
blew up his ship.

66
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:40,924
Ah, so you want me
to take his place.

67
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,093
Like I said,
you're quick.

68
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,220
Well, I've got
a better idea.

69
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,722
We're going to walk back
to the transporter pad

70
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,516
and you're going
to send me home.

71
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,476
Wait. Hear me out.

72
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,104
I'm not asking
for a lifetime commitment.

73
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:57,858
All I need is for you
to finish the mission
Sisko was on when he was killed.

74
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:01,820
I'm sorry, but you're going
to have to find someone else.
I don't belong here,

75
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,362
and I'm not
about to interfere

76
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,032
with events going on
in this universe.

77
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,242
At least let me tell
you about the mission.

78
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,119
Then, if you decide
not to help,

79
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,453
I'll send you home.

80
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:17,627
There's a Terran scientist
working for the Alliance.

81
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,714
Our sources tell us
she's close to completing

82
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,342
a new transpectral
sensor array

83
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:24,968
that will allow
the Alliance

84
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,054
to locate our bases
in the Badlands.

85
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:28,805
Without a safe
place to hide,

86
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,182
the Alliance
will be able

87
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,267
to track us down
and kill us all.

88
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:35,562
So, you want me
to prevent this scientist

89
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,689
from finishing her project?

90
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,650
Captain Sisko was convinced
he could change her mind--

91
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,277
get her to work for us instead.

92
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,196
How did he plan to do that?

93
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,114
She was his wife.

94
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,752
Jennifer.

95
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,963
You know her?

96
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,506
She was my wife, too

97
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,551
but, in my universe,
she's dead.

98
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:10,430
Not here she isn't...
not yet, anyway.

99
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,557
What do you mean
"not yet"?

100
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,310
Unless you can persuade
Professor Sisko

101
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,728
to join our cause,

102
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,188
we'll have no choice
but to kill her.

103
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,773
Kill her?

104
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,734
We cannot let her finish
the sensor array.

105
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,652
It'd mean the end
of the rebellion.

106
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:32,077
I can't let her die...

107
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,746
not again.

108
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:37,124
You're the only one
who can save her.

109
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:57,477
Mmm. Delectable.

110
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,233
And so are you.

111
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,360
(<i> door chimes</i> )

112
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,987
Enter.

113
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,618
Mr. Garak said
you wanted to see me.

114
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,870
Yes.

115
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,915
Come.

116
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,085
Join us.

117
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:25,046
If you're wondering
when the new sensor array

118
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,007
will be finished,
the answer is...

119
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:30,010
"As soon as possible."
I know.

120
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,886
Will that be all?

121
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,888
I have to get
back to work.

122
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,434
I have news
of your husband.

123
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,271
Nothing you could
tell me about Ben

124
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,856
would interest me.

125
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,774
I haven't even seen him
in five years.

126
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,609
Oh, I know that,

127
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:50,571
and I hope<i> that</i> will
make this easier for you.

128
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,990
You see...

129
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,661
Benjamin is dead.

130
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,082
Can I go now?

131
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,588
You must have
loved him very much

132
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:11,676
to be so angry with him,
to become so cold.

133
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,430
Were there other Terrans
killed with him?

134
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,267
Oh, a whole ship full.

135
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,853
All of this killing--
it has to stop.

136
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,813
Mmm.

137
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,565
And it will.

138
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,109
As soon as you complete
your transpectral sensors,

139
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,154
we'll be able locate
the rebel bases,

140
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,572
disarm them,

141
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,410
and put an end
to all this bloodshed,

142
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,747
and I will be able to resume
pressing the Alliance

143
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:46,169
to become more reasonable
to its Terran population.

144
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,553
You do believe me,
don't you?

145
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,061
(<i> chuckles</i> )

146
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,610
So it's agreed.
I help you get Jennifer
away from the Alliance

147
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,903
and then you get me home.

148
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,196
You get us Jennifer,

149
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,240
you can have
anything you want.

150
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,825
I just hope you
can convince her
to leave Terok Nor.

151
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,536
I don't understand
what Jennifer is doing

152
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,162
helping the Alliance
in the first place.

153
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,622
I mean, didn't she know

154
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,749
that Sisko was leading
the rebellion?

155
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,252
She knew, all right.

156
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:30,255
The truth is,
she and Captain Sisko
didn't get along too well.

157
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,673
Then again, the
Captain didn't really
get along with anyone.

158
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,176
In some ways,
the rebellion's
better off without him.

159
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,846
Don't get me wrong.
The Captain knew
how to fight.

160
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,765
But that's about
all he knew.

161
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,184
Ready?

162
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,894
You don't look
very confident, Chief.

163
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,687
Well, you better start
calling me "Smiley."

164
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,356
That's what the
Captain called me.

165
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,942
All right,<i> Smiley.</i>

166
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,989
I just wish we had more
time to get you ready.

167
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:59,242
I probably haven't told you
half of what you need to know.

168
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:02,078
I hope you don't run up
against too many surprises.

169
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:07,834
If I do, I guess I'll
just have to improvise.

170
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:23,642
I told Sisko he'd never
get close to Terok Nor,

171
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,519
and I was right.

172
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,562
I say we teach
the Alliance a lesson--

173
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:30,689
throw everything
we've got at Terok Nor
and rip it to pieces.

174
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,275
I disagree.

175
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,901
Following your suggestion

176
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,736
would do nothing
to enhance our goals

177
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,656
and would result
in a significant loss of life.

178
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,366
That's easy for you to say.

179
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,493
Those Cardassian pigs
didn't kill your brother.

180
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:44,287
We've all suffered losses
at the hands of the Alliance.

181
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,456
Nonetheless,
logic dictates caution

182
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,124
in the face
of a superior enemy.

183
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,418
Logic isn't going
to win us our freedom.

184
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,878
We have to take action.

185
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,214
BASHIR:
And we will.

186
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,924
But this time,
we do it my way.

187
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,552
And what do you propose we do?

188
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:01,221
We smuggle explosives
aboard the station,

189
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:05,433
plant them in her quarters
and detonate them.

190
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,519
You realize it is
highly unlikely

191
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,896
that anyone assigned to such
a mission would survive.

192
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,982
I say it's worth the risk.

193
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:16,486
Does that mean
you're volunteering
for the job?

194
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,363
(<i> excited murmurs</i>
<i>and comments)</i>

195
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,115
Captain, you're alive.

196
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,534
Of course
he's alive.

197
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:23,784
You can't kill
the Captain.

198
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:24,911
He's too ornery.

199
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,371
(<i> laughter</i> )

200
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,665
I hope that doesn't
disappoint anyone.

201
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,170
We're glad you're all right.

202
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,464
I'm sure you are.

203
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,050
We heard your fighter
was destroyed.

204
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,968
The Alliance
said you were dead.

205
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:45,139
Just their propaganda
machine working overtime.

206
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:48,142
But you know what
all that tells me?

207
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:50,937
They're scared.

208
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,397
(<i> laughing</i> )

209
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,107
And we're going
to give them

210
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:57,611
plenty of reason
to stay... scared.

211
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:01,155
DAX:
Well, well, well...

212
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,324
it's about time
you came back.

213
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,205
(<i> everyone oohing</i> )

214
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,460
That's to let you
know I missed you.

215
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,796
And that's for letting
me think you were dead.

216
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:20,007
I'm glad to see
you still care.

217
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,009
You coming or not?

218
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,473
I thought you told me
I was married.

219
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,016
Well, you are,
technically,

220
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,477
but she's your mistress.

221
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,937
I see what you meant
by surprises.

222
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,992
I'm really glad you're alive.

223
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,885
And I'm going to make<i> you</i>
glad you're alive.

224
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,724
We have a lot
of planning to do.

225
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,643
It can wait.

226
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,315
I suppose it can at that.

227
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,113
Well, these progress
reports are unacceptable.

228
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,783
Productivity
in the ore processing center

229
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:30,161
is down 15 percent.
You have got to do better.

230
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:33,373
Or are you purposely
trying to make me look
bad to Sector Command?

231
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,250
Not at all!
I've done everything
I can think of

232
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,419
to motivate the workers.
Such as?

233
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,129
Bribes, uh, torture...

234
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,215
I've even given
overseers permission

235
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,718
to execute any worker
not meeting the quota.

236
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,136
Well, I'm sure that
pleases the overseers,

237
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,681
but it is not
getting the job done.

238
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:50,849
Follow me.

239
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:01,192
INTENDANT:
Let's start with, uh...
him, him and her.

240
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,695
And do what?
Execute them.

241
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:06,447
I think you'll find that random
and unprovoked executions

242
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,991
will keep your workforce
alert and motivated.

243
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,661
I bow to your
brilliance.

244
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,873
GUARD:
Let's go.

245
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:15,956
You, too.

246
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,919
Though I do hope
your mood improves

247
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,588
before we run
out of workers.

248
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,048
What does my mood have
to do with anything?

249
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,675
If you don't mind
my saying,

250
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,218
I have noticed a certain amount

251
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,136
of ill humor
on your part lately.

252
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,971
I don't know
what you're talking about.

253
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,808
As I recall,
it began about the time

254
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:36,018
you learned
of Captain Sisko's death.

255
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:39,439
Now, why would I be upset
by such delightful news?

256
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,943
Well, I was under
the impression that you
were rather fond of him.

257
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,904
Well, then you were mistaken.

258
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:49,949
Well, I will say
this for him--
he did have spirit.

259
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,534
(<i> sighs</i> )

260
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,287
Too much spirit can be
a dangerous thing.

261
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:58,249
Tends to... infect others.

262
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:02,044
Well, that's something
we won't have to worry
about, at least.

263
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,631
With Sisko's death
and the imminent completion

264
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,258
of the transpectral
sensor array, the rebellion

265
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,385
is certain
to collapse.

266
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,304
You seem very sure
of yourself.

267
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,265
I am.
I'll remember that.

268
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,183
If the rebellion
continues,

269
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,685
I'll know who to blame.

270
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:33,701
Are you sure these Alliance
patrol patterns are accurate?

271
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,370
You tell me.
You gathered the information.

272
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,747
Hmm?

273
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,000
Oh, that's right.

274
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,335
Are you okay?

275
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,211
You seem a little distracted.

276
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,463
Just thinking.

277
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,256
I've been
thinking, too.

278
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,342
We've been fighting
against the Alliance

279
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,594
for almost a year now.

280
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,096
And what has it gotten us?

281
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,849
Nothing.

282
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:57,725
Sometimes I think
we were better off

283
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,811
when we were collecting
tribute for the Intendant.

284
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,437
Those days are gone.

285
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:05,024
Maybe... but I'm tired
of living like this.

286
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,861
The rebellion's a lost cause
and we both know it.

287
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,237
Don't you want to see
the Terrans gain their freedom?

288
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,824
Have you taken a good look
at your troops lately?

289
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,283
They're nothing
but ex-slaves

290
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,035
with delusions
of grandeur.

291
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,288
They'll never overthrow
the Alliance.

292
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,082
Let's just get
a ship and go.

293
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,877
Forget all about
the rebellion.

294
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,921
I'm not ready
to give up just yet.

295
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:30,008
It's not like you're going
to have much choice.

296
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:32,426
Once that witch
you married

297
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,470
finishes her new
sensor array,

298
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,807
Alliance ships are going to
be all over these Badlands.

299
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:40,476
We're going to have
no place to hide.

300
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:45,023
Then I guess we'll just have
to make sure she doesn't finish.

301
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,944
Trying to reach
Terok Nor

302
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,488
using small fighters
didn't work,

303
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,949
but we need to get
Jennifer off that station

304
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,493
and we need to get
her off there soon!

305
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:01,080
<i>We</i> have been meaning
to talk to you about that.

306
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,999
Mr. Bashir is
not convinced

307
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,710
that you can persuade
your former mate
to join our cause.

308
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:09,088
I can be very
persuasive.

309
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:13,217
Look! I don't even know
why we're bothering
to discuss this.

310
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,219
The Cardassians
destroyed your ship

311
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,221
way before it got even
close to Terok Nor...

312
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,433
Hit him. That's what
the Captain would do.
Go on, hit him!

313
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,101
...convince your wife
of anything!

314
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,311
Let's face it, Captain,
the woman hates you.

315
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:37,283
What my wife thinks of me
is none of your concern.

316
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:40,327
Anyone else want to disagree
with the Captain?

317
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,456
Put it away, Dax.

318
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,124
Go on!

319
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,043
Put it away!

320
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:53,841
No one is questioning
your authority,<i> Captain,</i>

321
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,010
but we have to stop her

322
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,096
before she finishes
the sensor array.

323
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,222
And there's only one
sure way to do that.

324
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,392
We have to kill her.

325
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,979
You've been saying
that all along.

326
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:10,733
Well, maybe it's time...
he listened.

327
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,069
DAX:
Killing her would
be a lot easier

328
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,071
than trying to get her
away from the Alliance.

329
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,073
O'BRIEN:
Easier, but not smarter.

330
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,033
If she's that important
to the Alliance

331
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,327
think how important
she could be to us.

332
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:24,914
We could use a scientist
on our side.

333
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,707
You tell them, Smiley.

334
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,751
At least someone here
is using his brain.

335
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,377
O'BRIEN:
Oh, think about it.

336
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,212
Who knows what
other weapons

337
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,756
the Alliance
is developing?

338
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,925
Someone like
Professor Sisko

339
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:38,845
could counteract anything
they come up with.

340
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,347
She's valuable.

341
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,724
We need her!

342
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,392
All right...

343
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,857
does anyone disagree?

344
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,945
Good.

345
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,989
Now let's get to work.

346
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,751
Tell the Intendant
what you told me.

347
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,506
It's about Captain Sisko.

348
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:18,176
Sisko?
He's alive.

349
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:20,302
He was able to get off his ship
before it exploded.

350
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,932
I suppose
it's possible.

351
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,643
It's more than possible.
It's true.

352
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:32,481
But I can tell you how
to get your hands on him...

353
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,359
if you're interested.

354
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,652
Ah.

355
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,456
Don't do that.

356
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,335
Can't help it--
it itches.

357
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,797
I hope this works.

358
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,841
It'll work, just
stop scratching.

359
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,553
(<i> sighs</i> )

360
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,348
You know, you did
pretty good back there.

361
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,767
I don't think
anyone suspected

362
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,435
you weren't
Captain Sisko.

363
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:14,190
At least,
not once you hit Bashir.

364
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,983
(<i> chuckles</i> )

365
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,318
But you and I both know
that was just a warm-up.

366
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:21,197
Jennifer is the one
I really have to convince.

367
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,950
I guess seeing her
isn't going to be easy for you.

368
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,619
How long's it been
since your wife died?

369
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:27,954
Five years.

370
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,665
Well, just remember

371
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:35,586
Jennifer may look like her,
but she's not.

372
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,463
She's a completely
different person.

373
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:40,716
I'll try to remember that.

374
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,010
Do you have any idea
what went wrong

375
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,929
between her and Captain Sisko?

376
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,513
From what I heard,
they never should
have been together 

377
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,390
in the first place.

378
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,269
She came from one of the few
privileged Terran families.

379
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:53,896
People who cooperated
with the Alliance.

380
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,274
The Captain fought his
way up from the mines.

381
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:57,775
What is she like, this Jennifer?

382
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,735
I don't know.

383
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:03,322
They'd separated by the time
I got to know the Captain.

384
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,074
What was your Jennifer like?

385
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,119
She was the kindest,

386
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,996
most caring person I ever knew.

387
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,583
I wouldn't get my hopes up.

388
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,169
Oh.

389
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,461
(<i> console beeping</i> )

390
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,755
Hold on.

391
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:23,301
I'm reading a slight energy
distortion in subspace.

392
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:24,802
What are
the coordinates?

393
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,344
It's coming from
all around us.

394
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,651
You know, Captain Sisko

395
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:43,070
would try to fight
his way out of this.

396
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,281
Be glad I'm not him.

397
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,454
Well...

398
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:55,499
if it isn't the notorious
Captain Sisko

399
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,626
and his friend,
the Tinkerer.

400
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:07,385
I'm glad to see you,
too, Intendant.

401
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,973
Still the same
old Benjamin.

402
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,392
You wouldn't have it
any other way.

403
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,854
Um, perhaps not,
but I'm still
going to kill you.

404
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:19,273
SISKO:
Maybe, but not
right away.

405
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:21,317
You flatter yourself.

406
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:24,028
Not unjustly, I hope.

407
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:28,324
Intendant! Please,
let me teach him some manners.

408
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,326
All in good time.

409
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:31,577
(<i> tsking)</i>

410
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,165
But first...

411
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:41,419
whatever shall we do
about O'Brien?

412
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:44,131
I remember the first time
I saw you, Tinkerer,

413
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,716
you were fixing
something.

414
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,343
You were always
fixing things,

415
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:48,802
making things better,

416
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,637
and everyone
loved you for it.

417
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:53,099
Even me.

418
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:55,142
But that just wasn't
enough for you, was it?

419
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:58,520
You couldn't be happy
staying here,
being loved.

420
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,856
You had to lash out
and betray everyone

421
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,775
who was ever
good to you.

422
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:03,901
Why?

423
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:09,115
I wanted to be free.

424
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,699
Free.

425
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,825
(<i> scoffs</i> )

426
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,702
You're a Terran.

427
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:16,414
You were born a slave,
and you'll die a slave.

428
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:18,040
Take him to
ore processing.

429
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,459
Remind him
where he belongs.

430
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:22,878
And what about Sisko?

431
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,798
Take me to
the Intendant's quarters.

432
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:28,508
Then she'll decide
what do with me.

433
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,177
Of all the impudent..!

434
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,846
Do as he says.

435
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:35,224
Intendant, I demand
that this man be...

436
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,600
Ooh!

437
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,686
You... demand?

438
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:43,065
You promised me he'd die.

439
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:46,902
And he will...
when<i> I</i> say...

440
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,570
and not a moment before.

441
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,197
Shall we?

442
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,949
After you.

443
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,337
I really don't know
what to do with you.

444
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:05,921
I sympathize.

445
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,798
It's a difficult decision,

446
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:12,470
but I'm sure you'll
come up with something.

447
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,347
The only reason
I can think of

448
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:16,890
to keep you alive
is to infuriate Garak.

449
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,059
What better reason
do you need?

450
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,020
(<i> both laugh</i> )

451
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:25,565
Well, suppose...

452
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,943
I let you live.

453
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,403
Hmm?

454
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:34,867
What will I
get in return?

455
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,494
What do you want?

456
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,705
Your loyalty.

457
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,957
That's all I've
ever wanted.

458
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,462
For you to be at my side,
my strong right arm.

459
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:51,800
But I'm afraid I can
never trust you again.

460
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,595
Which means...
that I will have

461
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:58,765
to dispose of
you eventually.

462
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:04,562
The question is should
it be sooner or later?

463
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,273
Do I get a vote?

464
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,650
Of course you do.

465
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,694
It just doesn't count.

466
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,570
(<i> laughing</i> )

467
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:17,201
No.

468
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:20,704
I've got to think about this.

469
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:24,208
You will let me know
what you decide.

470
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:27,169
I wouldn't dream of
keeping it a secret.

471
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,298
Hmm.

472
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:48,774
Jennifer.

473
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,484
Hello, Ben.

474
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,030
Please, leave us.

475
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,992
What, and miss this
touching reunion?

476
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,160
You heard her.

477
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,037
If you need anyone

478
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,705
to beat him into
submission for you,

479
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,792
please don't hesitate
to call me.

480
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,968
All right, I'm here.

481
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,678
What did you want
to see me about?

482
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,347
I was hoping we could talk.

483
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,267
Really?
You never seemed interested

484
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:25,519
in talking to me
while we were married.

485
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,316
I made a lot of mistakes
back then.

486
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,067
Save the apologies, Ben.

487
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,528
They're not going to work.

488
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,696
You are, without a doubt,

489
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:41,368
the most insensitive,
self-absorbed, egotistical...

490
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,786
You've made your point.

491
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,121
I doubt it.

492
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:45,789
You never listened to me before.

493
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,916
You were always too busy
trying to impress

494
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,751
every woman
who crossed your path.

495
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,254
Were there really that many?

496
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,089
There were enough.

497
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,799
And if it wasn't women,

498
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,385
then it was that ship of yours.

499
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:01,972
Sometimes I think it was
the only thing you ever loved.

500
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:04,057
Maybe I loved you both.

501
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,767
Then why did you leave me

502
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:09,396
to go run and play pirate
for the Intendant?

503
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:13,192
That's a good question.

504
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,365
Now this rebellion of yours.

505
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,828
Do you know
how many deaths you've caused?

506
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,206
How much destruction?

507
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,667
I'm fighting
to help free our people.

508
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:32,503
You're fighting
because you like
to fight, Benjamin.

509
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:34,171
The only thing
you've accomplished

510
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,964
is to give the Alliance
an excuse

511
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,425
to treat the Terrans
worse than before.

512
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,178
I just hope that
with your capture

513
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:44,181
this rebellion
can be ended peacefully.

514
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:45,807
Who said I'd been captured?

515
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:48,185
Oh, I suppose you came
here just to see me.

516
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:52,147
Actually, I came here
to rescue you.

517
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:00,656
Rescue me?

518
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,074
That's what I said.

519
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,783
I'm not going
anywhere with you.

520
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,077
You can't stay here.

521
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,620
I have a job to finish.

522
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,539
You mean the sensor array?
That's right.

523
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:11,041
If you finish the array,
you'll destroy any hope

524
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:14,002
our people have
for a better future.
I don't think you want that.

525
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:17,506
All I want to do is put an end
to all this fighting,

526
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:21,260
to force the rebels to seek
a peaceful settlement
with the Alliance.

527
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,136
It's not that simple.

528
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,889
The Alliance isn't interested
in a peaceful settlement.

529
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,933
If we lay down our arms,
we'll all be killed.

530
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,644
The rebellion
is killing people every day.

531
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,312
It has to stop.

532
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,481
Not this way.
Not while the Terrans

533
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,276
are still at the mercy
of the Alliance.

534
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,570
They're your own people,
Jennifer.

535
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:42,448
You have no right
to talk to me like that.

536
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:45,451
Since when do you care about
what happens to<i> our</i> people?

537
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:48,579
You've never cared about anyone
but yourself.

538
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:53,542
Maybe I've changed
in the past few years.

539
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:57,463
Oh, how many times
have I heard you say that?

540
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,561
I guess I was
a pretty lousy husband.

541
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,148
You guess?

542
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,817
Look, I know it's too late
for an apology.

543
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,694
You're right about that.

544
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:22,904
But for what it's worth...

545
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,740
I'm sorry.

546
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:26,866
(<i> sighs</i> )

547
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,243
What is it?

548
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,415
For a second, I
almost believed you.

549
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,754
You know
what I wish?

550
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:41,674
I wish I'd never met you.

551
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:45,678
And I wish things could have
been better between us,

552
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:48,639
but this isn't about us...

553
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,891
or is it?

554
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:55,395
Why are you working
for the Alliance?

555
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,272
Is it because you believe
in what they're doing,

556
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,982
or is it something else?

557
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,735
I don't know
what you're talking about.

558
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:06,532
I think the two of us have been
fighting each other so long

559
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:10,118
that you've gotten used to us
being on opposite sides.

560
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:14,206
But I'm not the enemy
this time, Jennifer.

561
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,999
The Alliance is.

562
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,627
The Alliance is<i> your</i>
enemy, not mine.

563
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:20,295
That's where
you're wrong.

564
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,963
Don't you see?

565
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,507
You're no different
than the slaves

566
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,967
working in the ore
processing center.

567
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,053
In fact, you may
even be worse off.

568
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,639
At least they know
they're prisoners.

569
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,891
What if I am a prisoner?

570
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:37,145
You don't have to be.
Fight back. Come with me.

571
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,439
You want me to join
the rebellion?

572
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,066
The way I see it,

573
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:44,361
freedom is a whole lot
better than slavery.

574
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:52,369
Think about it.

575
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,126
Took him long enough.

576
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,838
What are you doing?

577
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,381
Sending a message.

578
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,341
You have a subdermal
communicator?

(<i> grunts</i> )

581
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,432
Jennifer, I need an answer!

582
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,392
Are you coming
with me or not?

583
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,562
Do I have a choice?

584
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:03,231
Of course you do.

585
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,942
If you want, you can
go back to your quarters

586
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:07,569
and forget we ever spoke.
It's up to you.

587
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,657
All right,

588
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:14,493
but let's get
one thing clear.

589
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:15,744
What's that?

590
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:17,162
I still hate you.

591
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:19,038
I know.

592
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,712
Terran! What are you
doing down there?

593
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:29,424
I'm rerouting
the central ODN processor.

594
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,468
The Intendant's orders.

595
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:39,935
I don't recall
receiving clearance
for any repairs.

596
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,687
(<i> grunts</i> )

597
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,606
You don't say.

Hey!

00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:55,534
Get him!

O'BRIEN:
All right!

603
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,667
Anyone who wants to get
out of here, follow me!

604
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,043
Come on!

605
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:10,089
JENNIFER:
You still haven't told me
where we're going.

606
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:13,134
Airlock 7.
There should be a ship
waiting there for us,

607
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,429
providing we can get there
before the security
systems reactivate.

608
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,224
MALE:
Did you look in there?

609
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:20,266
Get back.

610
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:42,873
Now what?

611
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:44,708
Uh, I'll think
of something.

612
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:53,967
O'BRIEN:
Hey!

613
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,224
Good work, Smiley.

614
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,184
Yeah, the only problem is
there's 30 more of them
behind us.

615
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,686
Then we better get
to the airlock.

616
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,354
Come on.

617
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,199
Something tells me
that's not part
of your plan.

618
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:26,708
We'd better find
another way out of here.

619
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:29,502
Got any suggestions?

620
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,004
Fall back!

621
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,134
(<i> yells</i> )

622
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,733
That was very clever,
Benjamin--

623
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,526
having one of your
own men betray you

624
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,320
so you could
get aboard the station.

625
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,196
I was completely fooled.

626
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:59,032
Fortunately, Mr. Garak

627
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:01,200
is somewhat more
cynical than I am.

628
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,496
GARAK: Your Ferengi friend
informed us of
your entire plan.

629
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,247
With a little persuasion,
of course.

630
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,333
I'm afraid there's no escape.

631
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:11,003
Your ship's locked down.
Your pilot's dead.

632
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:12,629
There's no way out.

633
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:14,131
You might as well
surrender.

634
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:16,257
If we surrender,
she'll kill us.

635
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,177
Maybe us...
but not Jennifer.

636
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,596
What if we offer
her a trade?

637
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,099
I stay here and
she lets you live.

638
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:28,394
Benjamin, you know how
I hate to be kept waiting.

639
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:32,149
I came a long way
to get you out of here,

640
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:35,360
and I'm not going
to leave without you.

641
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,569
What is it?

642
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,113
Nothing.

643
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,658
Smiley...

644
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:43,785
how far is the ore
processing center?

645
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:45,578
Only a couple of levels.

646
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:49,082
Time's up, Benjamin.

647
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,300
Benjamin!

648
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,136
Pursue!

649
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:15,067
He always has
to make things difficult.

650
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:17,944
It's one of his least
endearing qualities.

651
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:40,008
Smiley, seal the door!

652
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,342
O'BRIEN:
Sure...

653
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,178
it's easy
for you to say.

654
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:00,528
I'm going to get you
out of here. I promise.

655
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,197
I believe you.

656
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:13,374
I don't know what
you're up to, Captain,

657
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,752
but there's no way
out of this room
except through that door.

658
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:17,754
Don't worry, I know
what I'm doing.

659
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:20,006
I just hope your
Terok Nor was designed

660
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,508
by the same Cardassian
that built
<i>my</i> Terok Nor.

661
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,721
Are you sure
they're in there?

662
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,723
Good.
Then we've got them.

663
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:32,060
Use the manual override
to open the doors.

664
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:35,272
This time, Intendant,
I trust you're not
going to be so lenient

665
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:36,689
on our dear Mr. Sisko.

666
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,191
Don't worry.

667
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:40,318
He's disappointed me
for the last time.

668
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,418
Oh, Jennifer.

669
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:03,925
Ah, I was so worried
about you,

670
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:06,385
but you're
safe now.

671
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,598
In fact...

672
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,392
I can assure you

673
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:18,857
that your husband will
never annoy you again.

674
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:22,360
Actually...
for the first time
since I've met him,

675
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,446
he's<i> not</i>
annoying me.

676
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:28,741
In fact, he's making
a lot of sense.

677
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,996
(<i> sighs</i> )

678
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:34,580
Well, he can be
very persuasive

679
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,291
when he wants to be.

680
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,466
I suppose this means
you won't be finishing
the sensor array.

681
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,682
I'm a Terran.

682
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:58,104
Keep her alive.
Kill the others.

683
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,899
Oh, I wouldn't.
You'd be making
a mistake.

684
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:05,528
The only mistake I made
was not executing you
in the first place.

685
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,031
You don't know
how right you are.

686
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:11,201
I have activated
the station's
self-destruct sequence.

687
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:14,829
Unless I disarm it,
this whole place will
blow up in nine minutes.

688
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,455
(<i> laughs</i> )

689
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,210
That's impossible.

690
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:22,212
There's no way
you could know

691
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:24,547
the station's
command access code.

692

696
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:44,776
I changed it.

697

You have eight minutes
and 30 seconds to let us go.

698
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:56,288
Otherwise, we all die.

699
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:59,582
Don't listen to him.
He's bluffing.

700
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,297
He's not bluffing.

701
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:06,756
GARAK:
How do you know?

702
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:07,840
I know.

703
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:13,888
Give me the new access code...

704
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,015
and I'll let you go.

705
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:19,102
I will give you the access code
once my friends and I

706
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:21,062
are safely away
from the station.

707
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:24,690
Do we have a deal?

708
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:30,238
This isn't over, Benjamin.

709
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:32,449
I'll hunt you down.

710
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:34,826
I swear it.

711
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,996
You're welcome to try.

712
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:12,238
Well, I'm glad to see
the two of you
are getting along.

713
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,366
We have a lot
in common.

714
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:15,992
He's all yours.

715
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,335
Dax tells me
you're leaving.

716
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:28,963
I thought I'd pay
the Romulans a visit,

717
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,049
see if I can convince
them to help us.

718
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:36,513
Then I guess
this is good-bye.

719
00:42:36,513 --> 00:42:38,973
Jennifer...

720
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:42,185
there's so much
I want to tell you.

721
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:44,521
I just don't know
where to start.

722
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:46,689
Why don't you start

723
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,859
by telling me
what happened to my husband.

724
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:58,410
He's dead, isn't he?

725
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,786
I'm sorry.

726
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,663
Don't be.

727
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:05,833
Who are you...

728
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:08,420
really?

729
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:14,217
It's a long story.

730
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:16,469
But ask Smiley.

731
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:19,556
He can fill you in
on the details.

732
00:43:19,556 --> 00:43:22,016
He seems like a good man.

733
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,643
He does at that.

734
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,022
So...

735
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,982
what are you going to do now?

736
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:37,240
Oh, I'm sure Smiley will find
something to keep me busy.

737
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,663
You're not really going to visit
the Romulans, are you?

738
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,626
The deal was that I get you
off the station

739
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,296
and then I go home.

740
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,800
Will I see you again?

741
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,302
I don't know.

742
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:05,435
Thank you
for rescuing me.

743
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:08,313
It was my pleasure.

744
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:13,276
Ready, Captain?

745
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:20,325
You'd better go.

746
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:25,204
Take me home, Smiley.
