1
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:04,167
That's it?

2
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:05,795
That's it.

3
00:00:05,838 --> 00:00:07,102
"The City of B'hala"

4
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:09,168
painted nearly 20,000 years ago.

5
00:00:09,212 --> 00:00:10,305
Hmm.

6
00:00:10,347 --> 00:00:12,545
Jadzia.

7
00:00:12,586 --> 00:00:13,747
You're looking

8
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:16,283
at the most important
Bajoran icon ever painted...

9
00:00:16,328 --> 00:00:19,563
the only known proof
that B'hala ever existed...

10
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:22,870
and all you have to say
is "hmm"?

11
00:00:22,908 --> 00:00:24,810
No.

12
00:00:24,846 --> 00:00:27,181
It's just that you both
gave it such a buildup

13
00:00:27,218 --> 00:00:31,489
I thought it would be
a lot... bigger.

14
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:34,056
We've been trying to force
the Cardassian government

15
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,731
to return this to us
since the end of the occupation.

16
00:00:36,772 --> 00:00:39,243
It's good to have it back.

17
00:00:39,278 --> 00:00:40,542
I thought you said
it was going

18
00:00:40,581 --> 00:00:42,414
to be returned
to the State Museum in Ilvia.

19
00:00:42,452 --> 00:00:44,923
It will be... tomorrow

20
00:00:44,957 --> 00:00:49,228
but I couldn't let it pass
without stealing a look.

21
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:53,105
Sometimes, being the Emissary
isn't such a bad thing.

22
00:00:53,142 --> 00:00:54,577
You see this?

23
00:00:54,611 --> 00:00:57,276
It's a <i>bantaca</i> spire.

24
00:00:57,318 --> 00:01:00,291
Ancient Bajoran cities
were built around them.

25
00:01:00,324 --> 00:01:02,226
They were all
about 11 meters high

26
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,231
made from hundreds of stones

27
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:06,601
carved and fitted
so tightly together

28
00:01:06,638 --> 00:01:07,971
they didn't need mortar.

29
00:01:08,008 --> 00:01:10,673
It's said they marked
the city's place in the cosmos.

30
00:01:10,714 --> 00:01:12,377
Beautiful markings.

31
00:01:12,418 --> 00:01:16,257
Supposedly, they're
the coordinates of the lost city

32
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,023
but because we can't see

33
00:01:18,063 --> 00:01:20,056
the markings
on the other two sides

34
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:21,866
they're impossible to decipher.

35
00:01:21,905 --> 00:01:25,812
Which is why B'hala
is likely to remain lost.

36
00:01:27,384 --> 00:01:31,051
Before you pack it up, have it
scanned into the computer.

37
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,560
You're going to study it?

38
00:01:32,595 --> 00:01:34,793
Maybe see if you can find
the lost city?

39
00:01:34,834 --> 00:01:38,569
I was just thinking
about Zocal's Third Prophecy.

40
00:01:38,608 --> 00:01:40,043
It said only someone

41
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,643
who had been touched
by the Prophets...

42
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:46,590
could find the ruins of B'hala.

43
00:01:46,626 --> 00:01:48,323
No pressure.

44
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:55,276
Computer, magnify grid C-4.

45
00:02:07,338 --> 00:02:09,331
It's a reflection.

46
00:02:11,514 --> 00:02:14,487
Magnify D-2.

47
00:02:18,696 --> 00:02:19,960
Hmm.

48
00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:38,062
Computer, process
Sisko image file 3-7-6.

49
00:02:38,105 --> 00:02:40,770
Reduce in size 75 percent.

50
00:02:42,582 --> 00:02:45,247
Oh.

51
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,423
Yes.

52
00:02:56,278 --> 00:02:59,911
Superimpose grid D-2.

53
00:03:03,093 --> 00:03:05,997
Reverse image and enhance.

54
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:22,569
Sorry to disturb you,
Captain, but...

55
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:23,730
But what?

56
00:03:23,772 --> 00:03:25,639
It's after 3:00 in the morning.

57
00:03:25,677 --> 00:03:27,910
3:00? Already?

58
00:03:27,948 --> 00:03:29,884
Time flies
when you're having fun.

59
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,230
Quark, I want you
to save this program for me.

60
00:03:35,264 --> 00:03:36,733
What is it?

61
00:03:36,768 --> 00:03:38,032
An ancient puzzle.

62
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,564
You know, Captain,
if you like puzzles

63
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:43,445
I have a wide assortment
of pleasure mazes...

64
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:46,784
and they all come
with a surprise in the center.

65
00:03:46,823 --> 00:03:48,554
Never mind, Quark.

66
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:51,658
I'll save the program myself.

67
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:01,150
Computer, Quark to Infirmary.

68
00:04:01,188 --> 00:04:03,989
Medical emergency
in Holosuite 4.

69
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:06,045
You said yourself
the Captain's all right.

70
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,616
Lucky for you.

71
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,425
Then why am I being arrested?

72
00:06:09,464 --> 00:06:12,631
I already told you
it was an accident...

73
00:06:12,671 --> 00:06:15,268
a minor technical difficulty.

74
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,609
You can't arrest someone

75
00:06:16,646 --> 00:06:18,513
for a minor
technical difficulty.

76
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:21,148
No, but I can arrest you
for negligence.

77
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,089
Your own records show
your holosuites

78
00:06:23,127 --> 00:06:24,994
are in desperate need
of maintenance.

79
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:26,364
Which is what

80
00:06:26,401 --> 00:06:29,568
I've been telling Chief O'Brien
for the past week.

81
00:06:29,608 --> 00:06:31,441
I begged him
to have Rom fix them

82
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:33,005
but you know what he said?

83
00:06:33,049 --> 00:06:36,079
"Rom's too busy upgrading
the sensor array."

84
00:06:36,123 --> 00:06:38,184
Can you believe that?

85
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,854
Anyone can fix the sensor array

86
00:06:39,897 --> 00:06:41,024
but no one can fix
the holosuites

87
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,037
like that idiot
brother of mine.

88
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:44,870
So, you see...

89
00:06:44,908 --> 00:06:48,404
if anyone should be
arrested for negligence

90
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,783
it's Chief O'Brien.

91
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:52,586
Tell it to the magistrate.

92
00:06:58,137 --> 00:07:00,233
Well, there's no sign
of any permanent neural damage.

93
00:07:00,276 --> 00:07:03,738
Although, I am reading
some odd synaptic potentials.

94
00:07:03,783 --> 00:07:04,876
Let me ask you something.

95
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:08,359
Does my uniform look
any brighter to you?

96
00:07:08,393 --> 00:07:12,459
Yes. Everything does.

97
00:07:12,502 --> 00:07:16,033
Colors seem more intense
and shapes more focused.

98
00:07:16,077 --> 00:07:17,774
It's called "post-neural
shock syndrome."

99
00:07:17,814 --> 00:07:18,873
Your neural pathways

100
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,215
were overloaded
by the plasma burst.

101
00:07:20,286 --> 00:07:23,225
All external stimuli are
going to seem more pronounced.

102
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:24,558
It's going to take
a little while

103
00:07:24,596 --> 00:07:25,895
for things to settle down,
though

104
00:07:25,931 --> 00:07:27,867
so I'm going to put you
on restricted duty

105
00:07:27,903 --> 00:07:29,064
for the next three days

106
00:07:29,105 --> 00:07:31,906
and if you experience
any other side effects

107
00:07:31,945 --> 00:07:34,678
such as headaches,
dizziness, even nausea

108
00:07:34,718 --> 00:07:36,187
let me know immediately.

109
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:37,815
Yes.

110
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:40,022
In the meantime, enjoy the show.

111
00:07:50,586 --> 00:07:53,490
So, did dinner meet with
the Sisko stamp of approval?

112
00:07:53,526 --> 00:07:55,997
Oh, Grandpa would be
so proud of you.

113
00:07:56,032 --> 00:07:58,799
I was a little worried
I overcooked the <i>lingta</i> roast

114
00:07:58,838 --> 00:08:01,674
but, uh... I'm glad
you liked it anyway.

115
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:05,242
Can I get you anything else?

116
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,914
Oh, no, I'm fine.

117
00:08:06,956 --> 00:08:10,920
I guess, uh... you'll
be cooking tomorrow night.

118
00:08:10,964 --> 00:08:12,490
Why is that?

119
00:08:13,737 --> 00:08:17,701
To welcome back Kasidy Yates
to the station...

120
00:08:17,746 --> 00:08:19,682
maybe cook
some of that jambalaya

121
00:08:19,717 --> 00:08:21,118
that she likes so much.

122
00:08:21,153 --> 00:08:22,246
We'll see.

123
00:08:23,826 --> 00:08:26,525
Dad, Kasidy spent
the last six months in prison

124
00:08:26,565 --> 00:08:27,932
for helping the Maquis.

125
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:30,132
She's paid the price
for what she did.

126
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:31,732
I suppose so.

127
00:08:33,748 --> 00:08:36,345
I just hope you give her
a chance, that's all.

128
00:08:37,555 --> 00:08:39,457
You two had something together.

129
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,142
Dad.

130
00:08:49,348 --> 00:08:51,250
Dad, what is it?

131
00:08:51,286 --> 00:08:54,691
These shapes...
I know what they are.

132
00:09:11,364 --> 00:09:12,958
Ops to Captain Sisko.

133
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:14,334
Go ahead.

134
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,637
Sorry to disturb you, Captain
but I have Admiral Whatley

135
00:09:16,675 --> 00:09:18,942
calling
from Starfleet Headquarters.

136
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,415
I'll take it in here.

137
00:09:22,989 --> 00:09:24,014
Hello, Ben.

138
00:09:24,058 --> 00:09:25,026
Admiral.

139
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,495
How've you been?

140
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,691
Never better.

141
00:09:27,732 --> 00:09:29,224
Glad to hear it.

142
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,362
I know you've been waiting

143
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:31,840
for this news for a long time.

144
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,039
I'm glad to be the one
who tells you.

145
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,381
Bajor's petition
to join the Federation

146
00:09:36,485 --> 00:09:37,612
has been approved.

147
00:09:37,654 --> 00:09:38,781
It's about time.

148
00:09:38,824 --> 00:09:40,316
Congratulations, Ben.

149
00:09:40,361 --> 00:09:43,060
You've done a hell of a job
out there.

150
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,261
Thank you.

151
00:09:44,302 --> 00:09:46,363
And we're not the only ones
who think so.

152
00:09:46,407 --> 00:09:48,878
The Bajorans requested
that the signing ceremony

153
00:09:48,913 --> 00:09:50,314
take place on your station.

154
00:09:50,349 --> 00:09:51,682
So make sure you spruce up

155
00:09:51,718 --> 00:09:53,620
that floating bicycle wheel
of yours.

156
00:09:53,657 --> 00:09:55,524
Count on me,
and a lot of other brass

157
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,463
showing up for this one,
Captain.

158
00:09:58,901 --> 00:10:01,099
Shh! Shh!

159
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,973
Shhhh!

160
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,313
Computer, spotlight.

161
00:10:09,558 --> 00:10:10,526
Drumroll!

162
00:10:15,036 --> 00:10:16,938
"Welcome Klingons."

163
00:10:17,977 --> 00:10:19,503
Not that one.

164
00:10:27,364 --> 00:10:29,460
I see you're prepared
for anything.

165
00:10:29,501 --> 00:10:31,836
Never hurts.

166
00:10:31,873 --> 00:10:34,777
I take it you think
the, uh, Federation membership

167
00:10:34,813 --> 00:10:36,373
is going to be good
for business?

168
00:10:36,417 --> 00:10:38,080
Of course it is.

169
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:40,752
This station is going to be
busier than an Alvanian beehive.

170
00:10:40,793 --> 00:10:42,126
I'm expecting to do

171
00:10:42,163 --> 00:10:45,694
five times the volume
in root beer alone.

172
00:10:45,737 --> 00:10:47,935
You see...

173
00:10:47,976 --> 00:10:50,504
it's all about foot traffic.

174
00:10:50,548 --> 00:10:52,381
The more people come in,
the more they drink.

175
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,048
The more they drink,
the more they talk.

176
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:55,250
The more they talk

177
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,524
the more they let slip
things that I shouldn't know

178
00:10:57,563 --> 00:11:03,270
and that... oh, that
always leads to latinum.

179
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:05,279
Perhaps so, but
there is one problem.

180
00:11:05,313 --> 00:11:06,976
What's that?

181
00:11:07,017 --> 00:11:09,113
There is an ancient
Klingon proverb that says

182
00:11:09,155 --> 00:11:11,558
"You cannot loosen a man's
tongue with root beer."

183
00:11:17,874 --> 00:11:20,402
It is wonderful news,
Vedek Mera.

184
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,916
I'll see you
at the signing ceremony.

185
00:11:24,088 --> 00:11:26,218
Enjoying the celebration?

186
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,559
As far as I'm concerned

187
00:11:27,596 --> 00:11:30,466
Starfleet should accept
a new member every week.

188
00:11:30,503 --> 00:11:33,670
And you, Major,
are you celebrating?

189
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:35,736
You know, five years ago,
I wouldn't have been.

190
00:11:35,781 --> 00:11:38,252
I didn't think
Federation membership

191
00:11:38,286 --> 00:11:41,190
was right for Bajor.

192
00:11:41,225 --> 00:11:44,095
It hadn't been that long
since the occupation.

193
00:11:44,132 --> 00:11:45,601
I thought it was important

194
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:47,902
for us to learn
to stand on our own two feet.

195
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,808
And what changed your mind?

196
00:11:49,845 --> 00:11:51,109
A lot of things.

197
00:11:51,147 --> 00:11:55,282
My time on the station,
my dealings with Starfleet...

198
00:11:55,323 --> 00:11:57,920
but mostly the Captain.

199
00:11:57,963 --> 00:12:00,434
He can be very persuasive.

200
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,234
No doubt about it.

201
00:12:02,272 --> 00:12:04,402
He made me a believer.

202
00:12:04,443 --> 00:12:06,242
Well, I'll drink to that.

203
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,011
Where is the Captain?

204
00:12:08,052 --> 00:12:09,954
I'd like to congratulate him.

205
00:12:09,989 --> 00:12:12,187
Well, he was here
for a little while

206
00:12:12,228 --> 00:12:13,993
but I think he went back
to the holosuite.

207
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,404
Don't worry, I fixed it.

208
00:12:22,383 --> 00:12:24,148
Captain?

209
00:12:35,178 --> 00:12:36,841
Sir?

210
00:12:39,353 --> 00:12:41,346
Is something wrong?

211
00:12:46,035 --> 00:12:47,698
Captain!

212
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,996
Benjamin!

213
00:12:56,999 --> 00:12:58,969
Major.

214
00:12:59,004 --> 00:13:00,974
Are you all right?

215
00:13:01,008 --> 00:13:03,809
I was there.

216
00:13:03,847 --> 00:13:05,316
Sir?

217
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,820
B'hala.

218
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:09,827
It was the eve
of the Peldor Festival.

219
00:13:09,861 --> 00:13:13,323
I could hear them
ringing the temple chimes.

220
00:13:13,369 --> 00:13:14,496
You were dreaming.

221
00:13:14,537 --> 00:13:16,336
No.

222
00:13:16,376 --> 00:13:18,107
I was there.

223
00:13:18,213 --> 00:13:22,849
I could smell
the burning <i>bateret</i> leaves

224
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:26,351
taste the incense on the wind.

225
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:31,229
I was standing in front
of the obelisk

226
00:13:31,274 --> 00:13:33,370
and as I looked up,
for one moment

227
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,144
I understood it all...

228
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:40,159
B'hala, the Orbs, the occupation

229
00:13:40,261 --> 00:13:45,068
the discovery of the wormhole...

230
00:13:45,105 --> 00:13:47,668
the coming war
with the Dominion.

231
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:50,547
You could see the future
as well as the past?

232
00:13:50,584 --> 00:13:51,848
For one moment

233
00:13:51,886 --> 00:13:55,189
I could see the pattern
that held it all together.

234
00:13:55,227 --> 00:13:58,689
You were having
a <i>pagh'tem'far...</i>

235
00:13:58,735 --> 00:14:00,534
a sacred vision.

236
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:04,141
Hell, I don't know what I had

237
00:14:04,247 --> 00:14:07,414
but it felt... wonderful.

238
00:14:07,454 --> 00:14:08,923
The Prophets chose well

239
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,088
when they made you
their Emissary.

240
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:13,156
So how does it all fit together?

241
00:14:13,267 --> 00:14:15,568
I wish I knew.

242
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,803
Someone woke me up.

243
00:14:19,948 --> 00:14:22,385
I was worried about you.

244
00:14:22,421 --> 00:14:24,084
I understand.

245
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:27,097
If I found you
in the middle of a <i>pagh'tem'far</i>

246
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,727
I'd be worried about you, too.

247
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,762
O'Brien to Captain Sisko.

248
00:14:31,808 --> 00:14:32,776
Go ahead.

249
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,575
Sir, I've just received word

250
00:14:34,613 --> 00:14:37,312
that Kai Winn is on her way
to the station.

251
00:14:37,353 --> 00:14:39,414
She should arrive
in less than two hours.

252
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,585
Thank you, Chief.

253
00:14:40,626 --> 00:14:42,790
Major Kira will greet her
at the airlock.

254
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:43,800
Make my apologies.

255
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:45,463
Tell the Kai

256
00:14:45,504 --> 00:14:48,477
that I am busy today,
but I'll meet with her tomorrow.

257
00:14:48,511 --> 00:14:49,479
Tell...

258
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,483
Make something up.

259
00:14:51,518 --> 00:14:52,645
Where are you going to be?

260
00:14:56,127 --> 00:14:57,926
Right here.

261
00:14:57,965 --> 00:15:00,266
The answer is in this spire.

262
00:15:00,303 --> 00:15:02,296
I know it.

263
00:15:17,007 --> 00:15:19,137
Kai Winn.

264
00:15:19,178 --> 00:15:21,148
Greetings, my child.

265
00:15:21,182 --> 00:15:24,246
You look... very sweet.

266
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,689
Looks can be deceiving.

267
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:27,993
But you don't need me
to tell you that.

268
00:15:28,031 --> 00:15:30,400
Why isn't the Emissary
here to greet me?

269
00:15:30,436 --> 00:15:33,067
I'm afraid Captain Sisko's
busy at the moment.

270
00:15:33,108 --> 00:15:36,275
Still basking in the adulation
of Starfleet Command.

271
00:15:36,382 --> 00:15:37,851
Well, something like that.

272
00:15:37,886 --> 00:15:39,150
I'm sure the Federation

273
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,285
is very pleased
with the job he's done.

274
00:15:41,393 --> 00:15:42,862
I thought everyone was.

275
00:15:42,897 --> 00:15:45,528
Well, not everyone.

276
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:49,202
You know, our culture
has had only five short years

277
00:15:49,244 --> 00:15:51,408
to recover from the occupation.

278
00:15:51,449 --> 00:15:54,046
Only five years of freedom.

279
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:56,025
It hardly seems
enough time, does it?

280
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:57,619
Well, Bajor's still
going to be free.

281
00:15:57,663 --> 00:15:59,861
Joining the Federation
isn't going to change that.

282
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:03,842
I see working beside Captain
Sisko all these years

283
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:06,074
has had quite
an influence on you.

284
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:07,641
I have to give you credit.

285
00:16:07,685 --> 00:16:09,746
You just never give up.

286
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:11,281
I'm sure the Emissary

287
00:16:11,326 --> 00:16:12,818
will consider everything
you have to say

288
00:16:12,863 --> 00:16:15,733
and then Bajor's admittance
can go forward...

289
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,433
unobstructed.

290
00:16:17,473 --> 00:16:19,603
I await the will
of the Prophets.

291
00:16:37,249 --> 00:16:39,618
Yes.

292
00:16:44,132 --> 00:16:46,125
Hello, Ben.

293
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:49,367
Kasidy.

294
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:51,641
Jake said I could
find you here...

295
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,390
Something wrong?

296
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,195
Uh, no, not at all.

297
00:17:00,234 --> 00:17:01,794
I'm just a little surprised.

298
00:17:01,837 --> 00:17:04,138
I didn't know
you'd be happy to see me.

299
00:17:04,176 --> 00:17:06,477
What are you doing
for the next few hours?

300
00:17:06,514 --> 00:17:07,743
I don't know.

301
00:17:07,784 --> 00:17:09,276
I just got here.

302
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,812
Why don't you come
to Bajor with me?

303
00:17:11,893 --> 00:17:13,020
Right now?

304
00:17:13,061 --> 00:17:15,589
I think I know
where to find B'hala...

305
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,365
the sacred lost city
of Bajor.

306
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:20,102
You see these markings here?

307
00:17:20,144 --> 00:17:23,208
They're a coordinate system
keyed to mark

308
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,951
the position of stars
at a certain time of night.

309
00:17:26,992 --> 00:17:28,723
You don't have
the faintest idea

310
00:17:28,763 --> 00:17:30,630
of what I'm talking about,
do you?

311
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:31,760
Uh, not a clue.

312
00:17:31,803 --> 00:17:35,402
Well, why don't you come
to Bajor and I will show you.

313
00:17:35,511 --> 00:17:38,176
I'm not even sure
where I'm staying yet.

314
00:17:38,217 --> 00:17:40,313
You can have your old quarters.

315
00:17:40,355 --> 00:17:43,328
If you want them.

316
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:44,831
They're still available?

317
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:47,132
Everything is just
as you left it.

318
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,869
I have some pull
with the station's C.O.

319
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:51,674
Ben...

320
00:17:51,714 --> 00:17:53,343
I've missed you.

321
00:17:53,384 --> 00:17:55,445
I'm glad you're back.

322
00:17:55,555 --> 00:17:57,788
Now, what do you say
we go find B'hala?

323
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:01,028
Somehow, I don't think
you'll take no for an answer.

324
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,193
This way.

325
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:37,209
Uh, we must be
200 meters underground.

326
00:18:37,246 --> 00:18:39,148
I don't want to be negative, Ben

327
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:41,712
but this doesn't look
like a lost city to me.

328
00:18:41,756 --> 00:18:45,218
You're looking at 20,000
years of sediment here.

329
00:18:45,264 --> 00:18:46,493
Come on. Stay close.

330
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,730
We're not far from...

331
00:18:48,772 --> 00:18:50,742
Oh, what's the matter?

332
00:18:50,776 --> 00:18:51,903
It's nothing.

333
00:18:51,946 --> 00:18:54,417
I'll be all right in a second.

334
00:18:54,451 --> 00:18:56,353
Julian said that headaches

335
00:18:56,389 --> 00:18:59,190
might be a side effect
of the accident.

336
00:18:59,228 --> 00:19:02,463
Or obsessing over
an ancient Bajoran city...

337
00:19:02,568 --> 00:19:04,367
is that a side effect, too?

338
00:19:04,407 --> 00:19:06,377
You're being negative again.

339
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:07,379
Come on.

340
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:09,406
It's just around the bend.

341
00:19:25,786 --> 00:19:26,754
What is it?

342
00:19:26,788 --> 00:19:29,419
B'hala.

343
00:19:29,462 --> 00:19:33,426
Ben, it's a wall of stone.

344
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,805
But what's behind the wall?

345
00:20:10,633 --> 00:20:12,432
These quarters
are not appropriate

346
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:13,461
for Admiral Colti.

347
00:20:13,506 --> 00:20:14,975
She outranks Admiral Veta.

348
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:17,378
Then we'll put her in H-2

349
00:20:17,415 --> 00:20:20,148
Veta in D-9,
and Rifkin in K-4.

350
00:20:20,187 --> 00:20:21,520
That will not do.

351
00:20:21,557 --> 00:20:23,151
Rifkin commands a starship.

352
00:20:23,194 --> 00:20:25,529
Protocol requires
he be given equal quarters.

353
00:20:25,566 --> 00:20:27,001
But he's only a Captain.

354
00:20:27,036 --> 00:20:28,733
It is naval tradition.

355
00:20:28,774 --> 00:20:30,904
So is keelhauling,
but right now

356
00:20:30,944 --> 00:20:33,211
we should focus
on accommodations.

357
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,847
Don't you agree, Major?

358
00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:36,857
Major?

359
00:20:36,891 --> 00:20:37,824
Hmm?

360
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,329
I'm sorry.

361
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:42,267
I didn't mean
to interrupt your reverie.

362
00:20:42,303 --> 00:20:45,435
I was just thinking about
Captain Sisko finding B'hala.

363
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:48,005
Bajoran archaeologists
have been searching

364
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:50,247
for the sacred city
for 10,000 years.

365
00:20:50,288 --> 00:20:52,087
He found it in just a few days.

366
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,995
Your gods have granted the
Captain a powerful vision.

367
00:20:55,031 --> 00:20:57,935
Or else he made
a very lucky guess.

368
00:20:57,971 --> 00:20:59,338
It's a sign.

369
00:20:59,373 --> 00:21:01,400
A sign from the Prophets.

370
00:21:01,445 --> 00:21:03,973
I wonder if the Prophets
can help us

371
00:21:04,017 --> 00:21:06,386
find quarters
for Captain Rifkin.

372
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,893
I hope I'm not interrupting.

373
00:21:08,928 --> 00:21:13,097
I was wondering, could I have
a word with you, Major?

374
00:21:13,137 --> 00:21:14,731
Of course.

375
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,334
Good luck.

376
00:21:16,411 --> 00:21:18,746
I was about to say
the same to you.

377
00:21:27,435 --> 00:21:29,064
Child

378
00:21:29,106 --> 00:21:32,375
you and the Emissary
are close, are you not?

379
00:21:32,446 --> 00:21:35,316
I consider Captain Sisko
a friend.

380
00:21:35,353 --> 00:21:37,084
So you know his mind

381
00:21:37,124 --> 00:21:41,088
how he thinks, how he reacts
in certain situations.

382
00:21:41,132 --> 00:21:44,765
I'm not really sure
what you're asking.

383
00:21:44,807 --> 00:21:48,908
I'm asking if you think the
Emissary will forgive me.

384
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,717
Forgive you?

385
00:21:51,755 --> 00:21:54,226
For doubting him.

386
00:21:54,261 --> 00:21:57,428
He must have been
aware that I never

387
00:21:57,535 --> 00:22:00,736
truly believed
he was the Emissary.

388
00:22:00,775 --> 00:22:02,745
I'm sure it crossed his mind.

389
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,182
Well, I was wrong.
I know that now.

390
00:22:05,218 --> 00:22:07,689
Only someone touched
by the Prophets

391
00:22:07,724 --> 00:22:09,387
could have found B'hala.

392
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:12,160
Does that mean you're not
going to try to block

393
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:14,399
Bajor's admittance
into the Federation?

394
00:22:14,472 --> 00:22:16,135
I'm going to follow the path

395
00:22:16,175 --> 00:22:18,669
the Emissary has
laid out for us.

396
00:22:21,488 --> 00:22:24,119
I...

397
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:29,433
I-I must admit
I'm surprised to hear that.

398
00:22:29,505 --> 00:22:32,444
It takes a lot of courage
to admit you're wrong.

399
00:22:32,545 --> 00:22:35,950
And you think I lack courage?

400
00:22:35,986 --> 00:22:38,423
I didn't say that.

401
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:41,157
But it is what you think.

402
00:22:41,197 --> 00:22:44,466
Those of you who were
in the resistance

403
00:22:44,538 --> 00:22:46,303
you're all the same.

404
00:22:46,342 --> 00:22:51,445
You think you're the only ones
who fought the Cardassians.

405
00:22:51,487 --> 00:22:53,788
That you saved Bajor
single-handedly.

406
00:22:53,826 --> 00:22:55,455
Perhaps you forget, Major

407
00:22:55,496 --> 00:22:58,297
the Cardassians arrested
any Bajoran found

408
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,636
to be teaching
the word of the Prophets.

409
00:23:00,674 --> 00:23:04,843
I was in a Cardassian
prison camp for five years

410
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:10,088
and I can remember each
and every beating I suffered

411
00:23:10,128 --> 00:23:13,863
and while you had your weapons
to protect you

412
00:23:13,903 --> 00:23:16,374
all I had was my faith

413
00:23:16,408 --> 00:23:18,207
and my courage.

414
00:23:20,851 --> 00:23:23,414
Walk with the Prophets, child.

415
00:23:23,457 --> 00:23:25,222
I know I will.

416
00:23:45,606 --> 00:23:47,075
Hello, Admiral.

417
00:23:47,108 --> 00:23:51,277
Ben. So this is
the ancient city of Balla.

418
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:52,480
B'hala.

419
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:57,525
Missing for 20,000 years,
and you found it.

420
00:23:57,565 --> 00:24:00,538
Pretty impressive.

421
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:03,943
Sure as hell
impressed the Bajorans.

422
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,609
How'd you know where to look?

423
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,951
You might say
it came to me in a vision.

424
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:10,859
I know that's
what the Bajorans think

425
00:24:10,895 --> 00:24:14,062
but just between me and you,
what really happened?

426
00:24:15,605 --> 00:24:17,974
I know it's hard to understand

427
00:24:18,011 --> 00:24:20,141
but it really was a vision.

428
00:24:20,181 --> 00:24:24,555
For the past few days, I've had
these moments of insights...

429
00:24:24,624 --> 00:24:27,425
flashes of understanding.

430
00:24:27,464 --> 00:24:29,765
And they started
after that accident.

431
00:24:31,272 --> 00:24:32,433
I don't know, Ben.

432
00:24:32,475 --> 00:24:34,104
This is a little strange.

433
00:24:34,146 --> 00:24:37,016
You didn't come here to see
B'hala, did you, Admiral?

434
00:24:37,052 --> 00:24:38,578
No.

435
00:24:38,655 --> 00:24:41,149
I came to see you

436
00:24:41,194 --> 00:24:43,597
and I was surprised
you weren't on the station

437
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:46,331
when I arrived.

438
00:24:48,677 --> 00:24:50,841
I'm sorry about that.

439
00:24:50,882 --> 00:24:52,476
Not sorry enough

440
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:55,981
to return my com signals...
all three of them.

441
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:59,592
That could get an officer
in a lot of trouble.

442
00:24:59,634 --> 00:25:02,265
Look, Ben...

443
00:25:02,308 --> 00:25:04,871
I need to know
that I can count on you.

444
00:25:04,913 --> 00:25:07,943
Now, Bajor's admission
is only the beginning.

445
00:25:07,986 --> 00:25:09,751
Now comes the hard part.

446
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:12,592
Federation Council members
have to be chosen.

447
00:25:12,697 --> 00:25:14,132
The Bajoran militia

448
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:16,263
has to be absorbed
into Starfleet.

449
00:25:16,304 --> 00:25:17,603
There are thousands

450
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,771
of details
that have to be overseen

451
00:25:19,813 --> 00:25:21,715
and you're our point man here.

452
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,951
That means we need to depend
on you more than ever.

453
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:26,186
Don't worry.

454
00:25:26,226 --> 00:25:28,128
I won't let you down.

455
00:25:28,165 --> 00:25:29,464
I'm glad to hear that.

456
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,630
Now what do you say we get
back up to the station?

457
00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:35,008
I can't go back to the station,
not just yet.

458
00:25:35,046 --> 00:25:37,313
Why not? I'm sure the Bajorans
can take it from here.

459
00:25:37,351 --> 00:25:40,084
Or were you thinking
of digging up this entire city

460
00:25:40,124 --> 00:25:41,353
all by yourself?

461
00:25:41,393 --> 00:25:42,760
Charlie...

462
00:25:42,796 --> 00:25:45,860
I just need a little more time.

463
00:25:45,903 --> 00:25:47,236
For what?

464
00:25:47,273 --> 00:25:48,674
For answers.

465
00:25:48,776 --> 00:25:51,806
There's... there's clarity here.

466
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,914
I-I wish
I could explain it better

467
00:25:54,957 --> 00:25:56,392
but I can't!

468
00:25:56,426 --> 00:25:59,125
You're scaring me
with this, Ben.

469
00:26:00,168 --> 00:26:03,232
I'm a little scared, too,
Admiral.

470
00:26:06,381 --> 00:26:07,816
All right.

471
00:26:07,851 --> 00:26:10,790
I'll give you some time

472
00:26:10,825 --> 00:26:13,992
but I want you back on the
station by 0700 hours tomorrow.

473
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:17,062
You're to report to Dr. Bashir
for a complete physical.

474
00:26:18,408 --> 00:26:19,900
I'll be there.

475
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:21,072
Good.

476
00:26:45,033 --> 00:26:46,627
It's 0715.

477
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,934
Where the hell is he?

478
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:50,034
His runabout only docked
25 minutes ago, sir.

479
00:26:50,078 --> 00:26:51,342
I'm sure he's on his way.

480
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,507
When he gets here

481
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,917
I want you to give
him a full workup.

482
00:26:53,952 --> 00:26:55,683
I examined him
before he left for Bajor.

483
00:26:55,724 --> 00:26:57,660
He didn't complain
of any new symptoms

484
00:26:57,694 --> 00:27:00,724
but my scan still showed the
same odd synaptic potentials.

485
00:27:00,768 --> 00:27:03,239
I was hoping the problem
would have cured itself by now.

486
00:27:03,274 --> 00:27:04,240
But it hasn't.

487
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:05,967
Isn't there something
you can do to help?

488
00:27:08,516 --> 00:27:11,386
I could try
neuropolaric induction

489
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:13,985
but that's
a very serious operation

490
00:27:14,027 --> 00:27:15,496
and I'd rather not do that

491
00:27:15,597 --> 00:27:17,830
unless it were
absolutely necessary.

492
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:21,172
So in the meantime, he's going
to keep having visions.

493
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,306
I knew we were
headed for trouble

494
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:25,513
the minute
he allowed the Bajorans

495
00:27:25,553 --> 00:27:27,045
to call him "Emissary."

496
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,992
He didn't have much choice.

497
00:27:29,027 --> 00:27:30,997
The Bajorans
are deeply committed

498
00:27:31,032 --> 00:27:32,091
to their spirituality

499
00:27:32,134 --> 00:27:33,967
not to mention
incredibly stubborn.

500
00:27:34,004 --> 00:27:36,669
They believe that Captain Sisko
is the Emissary

501
00:27:36,711 --> 00:27:38,340
and nothing's going
to change their minds.

502
00:27:51,443 --> 00:27:53,937
I told you he'd be here, sir.

503
00:27:58,325 --> 00:28:00,421
There's no need to worry.

504
00:28:00,463 --> 00:28:04,302
The katterpod harvest will
be much better this year.

505
00:28:10,652 --> 00:28:12,987
You don't belong here.

506
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,151
Go home.

507
00:28:18,736 --> 00:28:20,103
Captain.

508
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,769
What's wrong?

509
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,039
I'm fine.

510
00:28:26,654 --> 00:28:27,815
Admiral.

511
00:28:27,857 --> 00:28:29,953
What is it, Ben?

512
00:28:29,995 --> 00:28:31,464
Your son.

513
00:28:31,498 --> 00:28:34,596
You can stop worrying
about him.

514
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,538
He forgives you.

515
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:43,186
How the hell did he know

516
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:45,626
that Kevin and I
weren't getting along?

517
00:28:45,695 --> 00:28:47,187
He's the Emissary.

518
00:28:57,187 --> 00:28:58,656
That should do it.

519
00:28:58,691 --> 00:29:00,958
I'll have the test results
in a few minutes.

520
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:07,100
Well, that wasn't so bad,
was it?

521
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,451
Captain?

522
00:29:12,722 --> 00:29:14,351
Cardassia.

523
00:29:14,392 --> 00:29:16,021
Sir?

524
00:29:17,332 --> 00:29:20,099
That's where it was going...
the cloud.

525
00:29:20,138 --> 00:29:21,607
What cloud?

526
00:29:21,641 --> 00:29:23,372
I was on Bajor.

527
00:29:23,412 --> 00:29:24,847
B'hala had been rebuilt.

528
00:29:24,881 --> 00:29:27,648
The people were in the streets
celebrating

529
00:29:27,755 --> 00:29:30,386
but then,
a shadow covered the sun.

530
00:29:30,427 --> 00:29:33,662
We looked up
and saw a cloud filling the sky.

531
00:29:33,768 --> 00:29:36,900
It was a swarm of locusts...
billions of them.

532
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,072
They hovered above the city.

533
00:29:39,113 --> 00:29:40,844
The noise was deafening.

534
00:29:40,883 --> 00:29:43,787
But, just as quickly
as they came, they moved on.

535
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:47,263
Now I know where
they were going... Cardassia.

536
00:29:47,297 --> 00:29:48,926
What do you think it means?

537
00:29:48,968 --> 00:29:50,197
I don't know.

538
00:29:50,238 --> 00:29:52,971
At least the swarm
was moving away from Bajor.

539
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:56,006
That's a good sign...
isn't it?

540
00:29:56,051 --> 00:29:58,044
But what do the locusts
represent?

541
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,387
And why Cardassia?

542
00:29:59,425 --> 00:30:00,552
You were dreaming

543
00:30:00,593 --> 00:30:02,119
and dreams don't always
make sense.

544
00:30:02,164 --> 00:30:04,191
This was no dream.

545
00:30:04,234 --> 00:30:05,533
Captain,
why didn't you tell me

546
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:06,870
about these headaches
of yours?

547
00:30:06,908 --> 00:30:09,038
I guess I was too busy.

548
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:12,314
Well, if you'd stayed...
busy much longer

549
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,981
you could have died.

550
00:30:14,023 --> 00:30:16,756
The area of unusual
neural activity

551
00:30:16,796 --> 00:30:19,233
has increased
another eight percent.

552
00:30:19,268 --> 00:30:21,637
As a result, your basal ganglia
are starting to depolarize.

553
00:30:21,673 --> 00:30:23,108
I'm going to have to operate...

554
00:30:23,143 --> 00:30:26,480
try to repolarize
your neural sheaths.

555
00:30:26,517 --> 00:30:28,647
How will that affect my visions?

556
00:30:28,689 --> 00:30:30,785
That's not really
the issue here, is it?

557
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,261
It is to me.

558
00:30:32,296 --> 00:30:33,525
Doctor?

559
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:36,698
Well, there's no way
to tell for sure

560
00:30:36,739 --> 00:30:40,440
but I assume if I can complete
the procedure

561
00:30:40,481 --> 00:30:43,921
your brain activity
will return to normal

562
00:30:43,955 --> 00:30:46,222
and the visions will stop.

563
00:30:49,701 --> 00:30:51,534
Then you can't do it.

564
00:30:51,572 --> 00:30:53,405
Ben, that's ridiculous.

565
00:30:53,442 --> 00:30:59,183
If I don't operate,
sir...

566
00:30:59,222 --> 00:31:01,089
you could die.

567
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:04,031
I understand that

568
00:31:04,066 --> 00:31:07,528
but something
is happening to me...

569
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,068
something extraordinary.

570
00:31:12,418 --> 00:31:15,585
I have to see it through.

571
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:16,958
What do you mean
you're not going

572
00:31:16,995 --> 00:31:18,328
to let Dr. Bashir
operate on you?

573
00:31:18,364 --> 00:31:19,354
You have to.

574
00:31:20,369 --> 00:31:21,804
Don't you see?

575
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,808
These visions are gifts.

576
00:31:23,843 --> 00:31:25,608
I can't refuse them.

577
00:31:25,647 --> 00:31:28,448
I cannot believe
what I'm hearing.

578
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:31,755
Listen to yourself, Ben,
sitting there telling us

579
00:31:31,793 --> 00:31:34,857
that this mystical journey
of yours is more important

580
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,836
than watching your son grow up.

581
00:31:37,908 --> 00:31:41,747
Dad, please think
about what you're doing.

582
00:31:41,782 --> 00:31:43,752
These visions...

583
00:31:43,787 --> 00:31:46,350
they're not worth dying for.

584
00:31:47,395 --> 00:31:49,331
I remember...

585
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:52,702
the first time
I held you in my hands...

586
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,373
you were only a few minutes old

587
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:59,216
and I looked down at your face

588
00:31:59,254 --> 00:32:02,055
and it was almost
as if I could see

589
00:32:02,094 --> 00:32:06,433
your whole life stretched out
in front of you...

590
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:10,103
all the joys it would bring

591
00:32:10,144 --> 00:32:13,345
and the bruises...

592
00:32:13,385 --> 00:32:15,583
it was all there

593
00:32:15,623 --> 00:32:19,496
hidden in that
scrunched-up little face.

594
00:32:19,532 --> 00:32:27,472
The baby that I'm holding
in my hands now...

595
00:32:27,516 --> 00:32:31,582
is the universe itself

596
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:36,591
and I need time
to study its face.

597
00:32:36,636 --> 00:32:39,233
Look at the face of your son now

598
00:32:39,275 --> 00:32:42,942
and then tell me
you're doing the right thing.

599
00:32:44,888 --> 00:32:46,585
Come in.

600
00:32:50,834 --> 00:32:54,501
It's time, Emissary,
if you're ready.

601
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,513
I am.

602
00:32:57,549 --> 00:32:58,676
Ready for what?

603
00:32:58,718 --> 00:33:01,919
The Emissary has asked
for help in his journey.

604
00:33:02,026 --> 00:33:03,586
I'm providing it.

605
00:33:04,598 --> 00:33:06,329
And you trust her?

606
00:33:06,368 --> 00:33:07,928
Since when?

607
00:33:09,542 --> 00:33:12,515
Jake...

608
00:33:12,548 --> 00:33:15,213
it'll be all right.

609
00:33:24,074 --> 00:33:26,545
I love you...

610
00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:28,105
both of you.

611
00:33:45,053 --> 00:33:46,920
I've never seen the temple
so crowded.

612
00:33:46,957 --> 00:33:48,426
Seemed like every Bajoran
on the station

613
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,157
was there to pray
for the Emissary.

614
00:33:50,198 --> 00:33:51,497
Glad to hear it.

615
00:33:51,534 --> 00:33:53,527
He's going to need
all the help he can get

616
00:33:53,572 --> 00:33:55,041
if he's going to survive this.

617
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,544
The Captain is not going to die.

618
00:33:56,579 --> 00:33:57,547
He is the Emissary.

619
00:33:57,581 --> 00:33:59,642
The Prophets will take
care of him.

620
00:33:59,686 --> 00:34:01,121
With all due respect, Major

621
00:34:01,155 --> 00:34:03,251
I'd rather see Julian
take care of him.

622
00:34:03,293 --> 00:34:06,094
Chief, I know you're worried

623
00:34:06,132 --> 00:34:08,968
but the Prophets are leading
the Emissary

624
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:10,360
on this path for a reason.

625
00:34:10,493 --> 00:34:12,156
Do not attempt to convince them,
Major.

626
00:34:12,197 --> 00:34:13,666
They cannot understand.

627
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:15,897
Since when did you believe
in the Prophets?

628
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,770
What I believe in...

629
00:34:21,384 --> 00:34:23,514
is faith.

630
00:34:23,555 --> 00:34:25,616
Without it,
there can be no victory.

631
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:29,191
If the Captain's faith is
strong, he will prevail.

632
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,330
That's not much
to bet his life on.

633
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:34,640
You're wrong.

634
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,513
It's everything.

635
00:34:38,688 --> 00:34:40,453
I hope you're right, Major.

636
00:34:40,493 --> 00:34:41,894
I hope you're right.

637
00:34:44,267 --> 00:34:46,864
He asks for your guidance.

638
00:34:46,906 --> 00:34:50,311
Let him see with your eyes.

639
00:34:50,347 --> 00:34:54,048
Lift the veil of darkness
that obscures his path.

640
00:34:57,964 --> 00:35:00,128
Emissary?

641
00:35:02,641 --> 00:35:04,201
I'm ready.

642
00:35:11,594 --> 00:35:14,567
The Orb of Prophecy
is very powerful.

643
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,730
It taxes even the healthy.

644
00:35:16,772 --> 00:35:19,209
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

645
00:35:19,244 --> 00:35:21,511
I have to.

646
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,593
I need to bring
the visions into focus...

647
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:28,563
tie them together.

648
00:35:28,598 --> 00:35:31,069
I can't do it alone.

649
00:35:31,103 --> 00:35:33,005
But you're very weak.

650
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:36,014
Perhaps it would be better
to wait till after the signing.

651
00:35:36,047 --> 00:35:38,382
I may not have time.

652
00:35:38,419 --> 00:35:41,016
I need to do it now.

653
00:35:41,058 --> 00:35:43,028
As you wish.

654
00:35:43,063 --> 00:35:47,061
May the Prophets reveal
their wisdom to you, Emissary.

655
00:36:11,826 --> 00:36:14,822
He's already an hour late.

656
00:36:14,866 --> 00:36:17,599
He's still consulting
the Orb of Prophecy.

657
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:20,543
How long do these
Orb experiences last?

658
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:24,452
Minutes. Hours.
Sometimes days.

659
00:36:24,487 --> 00:36:26,457
Then maybe we shouldn't
wait for him.

660
00:36:26,492 --> 00:36:28,257
Do you have any objections
to proceeding

661
00:36:28,296 --> 00:36:29,993
without Captain Sisko?

662
00:36:30,033 --> 00:36:33,529
I'm sure the Emissary
would want to be here...

663
00:36:33,574 --> 00:36:36,375
but under
the circumstances...

664
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,268
May I have your attention?

665
00:36:49,308 --> 00:36:52,975
I've been looking forward
to this day for many years

666
00:36:53,016 --> 00:36:54,952
as I'm sure all of you have.

667
00:36:54,988 --> 00:36:57,721
Welcoming a new planet
to the Federation

668
00:36:57,827 --> 00:37:00,458
is the happiest assignment
an Admiral could hope for.

669
00:37:00,499 --> 00:37:02,970
The Federation is not just
a union of planets.

670
00:37:03,005 --> 00:37:04,304
It's much more.

671
00:37:04,341 --> 00:37:06,140
It...

672
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,572
Emissary!

673
00:37:08,617 --> 00:37:10,416
Get him to the Infirmary.

674
00:37:10,454 --> 00:37:12,687
No. I have to tell them.

675
00:37:12,793 --> 00:37:14,285
What is it, Emissary?

676
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,961
Have the Prophets
revealed something to you?

677
00:37:19,041 --> 00:37:20,943
Locusts...

678
00:37:20,978 --> 00:37:22,345
they'll destroy Bajor

679
00:37:22,381 --> 00:37:23,907
unless it stands alone.

680
00:37:23,952 --> 00:37:26,617
Ben, what the hell
are you talking about?

681
00:37:26,657 --> 00:37:28,286
It's too soon!

682
00:37:28,328 --> 00:37:31,824
Bajor must not join
the Federation.

683
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:35,240
If it does,
it will be destroyed.

684
00:37:46,968 --> 00:37:49,872
His entire central nervous
system is depolarizing.

685
00:37:49,909 --> 00:37:51,776
We have to operate
immediately.

686
00:37:51,846 --> 00:37:53,315
Then what are you waiting for?

687
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:56,288
Captain Sisko made it clear
he didn't want surgery.

688
00:37:56,322 --> 00:37:58,623
What are you suggesting, Major?

689
00:37:58,661 --> 00:38:00,255
We stand around
and let him die?

690
00:38:00,298 --> 00:38:02,963
It isn't about what I want
or what you want.

691
00:38:03,003 --> 00:38:04,734
It's about Captain Sisko

692
00:38:04,841 --> 00:38:07,312
and he told us that he
doesn't want anything

693
00:38:07,347 --> 00:38:09,750
interfering with his visions.

694
00:38:09,785 --> 00:38:11,550
Major, these visions
may be important

695
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,525
but I think
we're all in agreement here

696
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,295
that they are not as important
as Captain Sisko's life.

697
00:38:17,335 --> 00:38:18,634
Start the procedures.

698
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:19,970
It's not that simple.

699
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:22,172
Captain Sisko refused surgery

700
00:38:22,212 --> 00:38:24,342
and I can't go against
the decision of my patient...

701
00:38:24,384 --> 00:38:28,223
not without the express consent
of his closest relative.

702
00:38:32,034 --> 00:38:34,631
I guess that means
it's up to me.

703
00:38:43,393 --> 00:38:45,660
Dad...

704
00:38:45,697 --> 00:38:48,966
I know you want to see
this thing to the end...

705
00:38:52,211 --> 00:38:53,372
but...

706
00:38:56,054 --> 00:38:57,614
I need you.

707
00:39:12,022 --> 00:39:13,651
I'm sorry.

708
00:39:21,209 --> 00:39:23,646
Do what you have to do.

709
00:39:23,681 --> 00:39:24,808
Prepare for surgery.

710
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:27,185
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to ask you all to leave.

711
00:39:28,525 --> 00:39:29,515
Nurse.

712
00:39:49,404 --> 00:39:51,306
Any news about the Emissary?

713
00:39:51,341 --> 00:39:52,970
He's still in surgery.

714
00:39:54,415 --> 00:39:56,385
I hope the Prophets
will forgive us.

715
00:39:56,419 --> 00:39:59,392
We never should have allowed
the Federation to interfere

716
00:39:59,426 --> 00:40:00,918
with the Emissary's visions.

717
00:40:00,963 --> 00:40:02,592
It wasn't the Federation.

718
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,432
It was his son
and he had every right

719
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,597
to make that decision.

720
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:07,472
It was a selfish act.

721
00:40:07,511 --> 00:40:09,208
He's an 18-year-old boy

722
00:40:09,248 --> 00:40:11,549
who doesn't want
to lose his father.

723
00:40:11,586 --> 00:40:14,114
What would you have
done in his place?

724
00:40:16,396 --> 00:40:18,423
I would trust the Prophets.

725
00:40:18,468 --> 00:40:21,737
Maybe we're the ones who need
to trust the Prophets.

726
00:40:21,775 --> 00:40:24,542
For all we know,
this is part of their plan.

727
00:40:24,581 --> 00:40:27,144
Maybe... maybe they've told
Captain Sisko

728
00:40:27,187 --> 00:40:29,248
everything
they want him to know.

729
00:40:29,292 --> 00:40:31,388
Perhaps.

730
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,989
I suppose you heard

731
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,164
that Bajor will
not join the Federation today.

732
00:40:36,207 --> 00:40:37,608
The Council

733
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:40,013
of Ministers has voted
to delay acceptance

734
00:40:40,116 --> 00:40:41,915
of Federation membership.

735
00:40:41,953 --> 00:40:44,186
You must be very pleased.

736
00:40:44,225 --> 00:40:45,922
I wish I were

737
00:40:45,962 --> 00:40:50,028
but things are not that simple,
not anymore.

738
00:40:50,071 --> 00:40:56,210
Before Captain Sisko found
B'hala, my path was clear.

739
00:40:56,251 --> 00:40:58,552
I knew who my enemies were.

740
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:02,352
But now...
now, nothing is certain.

741
00:41:02,484 --> 00:41:05,753
Makes life interesting,
doesn't it?

742
00:41:14,411 --> 00:41:16,244
No...

743
00:41:16,282 --> 00:41:19,687
No! You took them away!

744
00:41:19,722 --> 00:41:22,023
We had no choice.

745
00:41:22,061 --> 00:41:23,894
You were dying.

746
00:41:23,932 --> 00:41:27,030
I almost had it.

747
00:41:27,072 --> 00:41:30,068
Almost understood it all.

748
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:33,449
Now it's gone.

749
00:41:55,401 --> 00:41:56,734
Yes.

750
00:42:00,445 --> 00:42:02,005
How are you feeling?

751
00:42:02,049 --> 00:42:05,079
I'm fine, Admiral.

752
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:08,221
Look, Ben, it's not too late.

753
00:42:08,262 --> 00:42:11,098
You could contact
the Chamber of Ministers...

754
00:42:11,136 --> 00:42:13,072
tell them you were wrong.

755
00:42:13,106 --> 00:42:15,942
Convince them to accept
Federation membership.

756
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:19,751
I can't do that.

757
00:42:19,788 --> 00:42:22,589
The visions may have faded.

758
00:42:22,627 --> 00:42:25,566
Everything I said,
everything I did

759
00:42:25,601 --> 00:42:26,796
still feels right.

760
00:42:26,837 --> 00:42:28,136
When I said

761
00:42:28,173 --> 00:42:31,476
that Bajor should wait
before it joins the Federation

762
00:42:31,513 --> 00:42:34,884
I have never felt so certain
about anything in my life.

763
00:42:34,988 --> 00:42:37,984
I was afraid
you would say that, Ben.

764
00:42:39,465 --> 00:42:41,993
I could have
your commission for this.

765
00:42:42,037 --> 00:42:43,836
I know.

766
00:42:43,874 --> 00:42:46,539
But considering
how the Bajorans feel about you

767
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,778
if I pulled you from this post

768
00:42:48,818 --> 00:42:50,948
we'd probably
lose Bajor forever.

769
00:42:52,961 --> 00:42:55,592
Admiral, for what it's worth

770
00:42:55,633 --> 00:42:58,503
I wish things
had turned out differently.

771
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,032
So do I.

772
00:43:00,076 --> 00:43:01,875
But it's not over.

773
00:43:01,914 --> 00:43:04,545
One day, Bajor will join
the Federation.

774
00:43:04,586 --> 00:43:06,488
That I'm sure of.

775
00:43:07,994 --> 00:43:10,295
Are you speaking
as a Starfleet Captain

776
00:43:10,332 --> 00:43:12,496
or as the Emissary
of the Prophets?

777
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,537
Both.

778
00:43:15,577 --> 00:43:17,137
In that case

779
00:43:17,181 --> 00:43:19,448
I'll keep the champagne on ice.

780
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,567
Just in time, Dad.

781
00:43:32,547 --> 00:43:34,608
What's this all about?

782
00:43:34,652 --> 00:43:36,087
It's about jambalaya.

783
00:43:37,391 --> 00:43:40,455
We never had that "welcome back"
dinner for Kasidy.

784
00:43:42,102 --> 00:43:44,038
Welcome back...

785
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:47,503
the both of us.

786
00:43:51,356 --> 00:43:55,491
Ben, I can't say I understand
what you've gone through.

787
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:58,003
I know you feel you've lost
something important

788
00:43:58,104 --> 00:44:00,337
and maybe you have.

789
00:44:00,376 --> 00:44:01,902
But believe me...

790
00:44:05,052 --> 00:44:09,221
you've held on
to something important as well.
