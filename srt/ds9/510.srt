1
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:04,171
DAX:
That's it?

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:05,673
SISKO:
That's it.

3
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:07,048
"The City of B'hala"

4
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:09,176
painted nearly
20,000 years ago.

5
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,344
Hmm.

6
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,220
Jadzia.

7
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,764
You're looking

8
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:16,391
at the most important
Bajoran icon ever painted--

9
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:19,603
the only known proof
that B'hala ever existed--

10
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:22,731
and all you have
to say is "hmm"?

11
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,817
No.

12
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:27,068
It's just that you both
gave it such a buildup

13
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:30,906
I thought it would be
a lot... bigger.

14
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:32,908
We've been trying to force
the Cardassian government

15
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:36,787
to return this to us
since the end of the occupation.

16
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:38,956
It's good to have it back.

17
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,457
I thought you said
it was going

18
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,376
to be returned
to the State Museum in Ilvia.

19
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,879
It will be... tomorrow

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,257
but I couldn't let it pass
without stealing a look.

21
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:52,970
Sometimes, being the Emissary
isn't such a bad thing.

22
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,555
You see this?

23
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:57,224
It's a<i> bantaca</i> spire.

24
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,350
Ancient Bajoran cities

25
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,685
were built
around them.

26
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:02,229
They were all
about 11 meters high

27
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,314
made from hundreds of stones

28
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,484
carved and fitted
so tightly together
they didn't need mortar.

29
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:10,696
It's said they marked
the city's place in the cosmos.

30
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,280
Beautiful markings.

31
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,284
Supposedly, they're
the coordinates of the lost city

32
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,828
but because we can't see

33
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:19,371
the markings
on the other two sides

34
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,373
they're impossible
to decipher.

35
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:25,210
Which is why B'hala
is likely to remain lost.

36
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,214
Before you pack it up,
have it scanned

37
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,424
into the computer.

38
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,009
You're going to study it?

39
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,302
Maybe see if you can find
the lost city?

40
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,637
KIRA:
I was just thinking

41
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,097
about Zocal's Third Prophecy.

42
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,600
It said
only someone

43
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,062
who had been touched
by the Prophets...

44
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:46,105
could find
the ruins of B'hala.

45
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,816
No pressure.

46
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,778
(<i> laughs dismissively</i> )

47
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:54,740
Computer, magnify grid C-4.

48
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:08,879
It's a reflection.

49
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,801
Magnify D-2.

50
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,389
Hmm.

51
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:37,449
Computer, process
Sisko image file 3-7-6.

52
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,119
Reduce in size 75 percent.

53
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:44,706
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
Oh.

54
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,921
(<i> softly</i> ):
Yes.

55
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:59,262
Superimpose grid D-2.

56
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:05,435
Reverse image and enhance.

57
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,077
Sorry to disturb you,
Captain, but...

58
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,244
But what?

59
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,164
It's after 3:00
in the morning.

60
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:27,415
3:00? Already?

61
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,250
Time flies
when you're having fun.

62
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,631
Quark, I want you
to save this program for me.

63
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,257
What is it?

64
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,425
An ancient puzzle.

65
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,719
You know, Captain,

66
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,054
if you like puzzles,

67
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:42,973
I have a wide assortment
of pleasure mazes--

68
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:46,309
and they all come
with a surprise in the center.

69
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,978
Never mind, Quark.

70
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,939
I'll save the program myself.

71
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,528
(<i> groans</i> )

72
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,699
Computer, Quark to Infirmary.

73
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,410
Medical emergency
in Holosuite 4.

74
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:06,407
You said yourself
the Captain's all right.

75
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,076
Lucky for you.

76
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,911
Then why am I
being arrested?

77
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:13,081
I already told you
it was an accident--

78
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,709
a minor technical
difficulty.

79
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,044
You can't
arrest someone

80
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,004
for a minor
technical difficulty.

81
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,840
No, but I can arrest you
for negligence.

82
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,675
Your own records show
your holosuites

83
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:26,427
are in desperate need
of maintenance.

84
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,973
Which is what I've been telling
Chief O'Brien for the past week.

85
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,850
I begged him
to have Rom fix them

86
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,476
but you know what he said?

87
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,646
"Rom's too busy upgrading
the sensor array."

88
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,857
Can you believe that?

89
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,317
Anyone can fix the sensor array

90
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,609
but no one can fix
the holosuites

91
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,570
like that idiot
brother of mine.

92
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,322
So, you see...

93
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:48,700
if anyone should be
arrested for negligence

94
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,285
it's Chief O'Brien.

95
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,996
Tell it to the magistrate.

96
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,754
Well, there's no sign
of any permanent neural damage.

97
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:04,174
Although, I am reading
some odd synaptic potentials.

98
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,466
Let me ask you something.

99
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:09,012
Does my uniform look
any brighter to you?

100
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:13,183
Yes. Everything does.

101
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:16,603
Colors seem more intense
and shapes more focused.

102
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,021
It's called "post-neural
shock syndrome."

103
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,231
Your neural pathways

104
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:20,815
were overloaded
by the plasma burst.

105
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,484
All external stimuli are
going to seem more pronounced.

106
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,819
It's going to take
a little while

107
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,238
for things
to settle down, though,

108
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,073
so I'm going to put you
on restricted duty

109
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,490
for the next three days

110
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,286
and if you experience
any other side effects

111
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:35,122
such as headaches,
dizziness, even nausea

112
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,497
let me know immediately.

113
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,250
Yes.

114
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,627
In the meantime,
enjoy the show.

115
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,929
(<i> sighs</i> )

116
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:51,972
So, did dinner meet

117
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,057
with the Sisko
stamp of approval?

118
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,602
Oh, Grandpa would be
so proud of you.

119
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,146
I was a little worried
I overcooked the<i> lingta</i> roast

120
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:02,149
but, uh... I'm glad
you liked it anyway.

121
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,693
Can I get you
anything else?

122
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,362
Oh, no, I'm fine.

123
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:11,450
I guess, uh...<i> you'll</i>
be cooking tomorrow night.

124
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,909
Why is that?

125
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:18,123
To welcome back Kasidy Yates
to the station--

126
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,125
maybe cook some
of that jambalaya

127
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,460
that she likes so much.

128
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,585
We'll see.

129
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,923
Dad, Kasidy spent
the last six months in prison

130
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,342
for helping the Maquis.

131
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,635
She's paid the price
for what she did.

132
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,179
I suppose so.

133
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:36,683
I just hope you give her
a chance, that's all.

134
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,811
You two had something together.

135
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,402
Dad.

136
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,698
Dad, what is it?

137
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:56,036
These shapes...
I know what they are.

138
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,053
DAX:
<i>Ops to Captain Sisko.</i>

139
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,846
Go ahead.

140
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,224
<i>Sorry to disturb you, Captain,</i>
<i>but I have Admiral Whatley</i>

141
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,351
<i>calling</i>
<i>from Starfleet Headquarters.</i>

142
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,768
I'll take it in here.

143
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,523
<i>Hello, Ben.</i>

144
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:25,482
Admiral.

145
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:26,774
<i>How've you been?</i>

146
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,694
Never better.<i> </i>
<i>Glad to hear it.</i>

147
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,197
<i>I know you've been waiting</i>
<i>for this news for a long time.</i>

148
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,449
<i>I'm glad to be the one</i>
<i>who tells you.</i>

149
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,784
<i>Bajor's petition</i>
<i>to join the Federation</i>

150
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:37,952
<i>has been approved.</i>

151
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,204
It's about time.

152
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,788
<i>Congratulations, Ben.</i>

153
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,083
<i>You've done a hell of a job</i>
<i>out there.</i>

154
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,625
Thank you.

155
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,794
<i>And we're not the only ones</i>
<i>who think so.</i>

156
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,755
<i>The Bajorans requested</i>
<i>that the signing ceremony</i>

157
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,715
<i>take place on your station.</i>

158
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,175
<i>So make sure you spruce up</i>

159
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,177
<i>that floating bicycle wheel</i>
<i>of yours.</i>

160
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,054
<i>Count on me,</i>
<i>and a lot of other brass</i>

161
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,764
<i>showing up for this one,</i>
<i>Captain.</i>

162
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,560
QUARK:
Shh! Shh!

163
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,395
Shhhh!

164
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:06,565
Computer, spotlight.

165
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,027
Drumroll!

166
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:14,406
(<i> drumroll sounds</i> )

167
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,407
(<i> cymbal crash</i> )

168
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,325
"Welcome Klingons."

169
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,786
Not that one.

170
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,042
(<i> crowd aahs and applauds</i> )

171
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,712
I see you're prepared
for anything.

172
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,382
Never hurts.

173
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:35,302
I take it you think
the, uh, Federation membership

174
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,844
is going to be good
for business?

175
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,638
Of course it is.

176
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,057
This station is going to be
busier than an Alvanian beehive.

177
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:45,979
I'm expecting to do
five times the volume
in root beer alone.

178
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,231
You see...

179
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,900
it's all about foot traffic.

180
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,693
The more people come in,
the more they drink.

181
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,112
The more they drink,
the more they talk.

182
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,738
The more they talk,

183
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,907
the more they let slip
things that I shouldn't know,

184
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:03,622
and that... oh, that
always leads to latinum.

185
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:05,665
Perhaps so, but
there is one problem.

186
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,542
What's that?

187
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,252
There is an ancient
Klingon proverb that says

188
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,838
"You cannot loosen a man's
tongue with root beer."

189
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,763
It is wonderful news,
Vedek Mera.

190
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,265
I'll see you
at the signing ceremony.

191
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,603
Enjoying the
celebration?

192
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,021
As far as I'm concerned,

193
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,857
Starfleet should accept
a new member every week.

194
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:34,027
And you, Major,
are you celebrating?

195
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,112
You know, five years ago,
I wouldn't have been.

196
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,615
I didn't think
Federation membership

197
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,700
was right for Bajor.

198
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,412
It hadn't been that long
since the occupation.

199
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,039
I thought it was important

200
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,166
for us to learn
to stand on our own two feet.

201
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,084
And what changed
your mind?

202
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,628
A lot of things.

203
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:55,674
My time on the station,
my dealings with Starfleet...

204
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:58,218
but mostly the Captain.

205
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,803
He can be very persuasive.

206
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,639
No doubt about it.

207
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,849
He made me a believer.

208
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,643
Well, I'll drink to that.

209
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,311
Where is the Captain?

210
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,271
I'd like to congratulate him.

211
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,566
Well, he was here
for a little while,

212
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,359
but I think he went back
to the holosuite.

213
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,613
Don't worry,
I fixed it.

214
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,536
Captain?

215
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,131
Sir?

216
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,511
Is something wrong?

217
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,934
Captain!

218
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,276
Benjamin!

219
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,195
Major.

220
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,322
Are you all right?

221
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,117
I was there.

222
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,702
Sir?

223
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,328
B'hala.

224
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,331
It was the eve
of the Peldor Festival.

225
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,585
I could hear them
ringing the temple chimes.

226
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:17,547
You were dreaming.
No.

227
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,049
I was there.

228
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,136
I could smell
the burning<i> bateret</i> leaves

229
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,514
taste the incense on the wind.

230
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,561
I was standing in front
of the obelisk

231
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,772
and as I looked up,
for one moment

232
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:36,691
I understood it all--

233
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:41,780
B'hala, the Orbs,
the occupation,

234
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,532
the discovery of the wormhole...

235
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,578
the coming war
with the Dominion.

236
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:51,080
You could see the future
as well as the past?

237
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,582
For one moment

238
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:55,918
I could see the pattern
that held it all together.

239
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,172
You were having
a<i> pagh'tem'far...</i>

240
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,048
a sacred vision.

241
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,843
Hell, I don't know what I had,

242
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:08,139
but it felt... wonderful.

243
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,683
The Prophets chose well

244
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,685
when they made you
their Emissary.

245
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,852
So how does it all
fit together?

246
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:16,272
I wish I knew.

247
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,358
Someone woke me up.

248
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,029
I was worried about you.

249
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,781
I understand.

250
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,617
If I found you
in the middle of a<i> pagh'tem'far,</i>

251
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,411
I'd be worried about you, too.

252
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,246
<i>O'Brien to Captain Sisko.</i>

253
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,456
Go ahead.

254
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,208
<i>Sir, I've just received word</i>

255
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,877
<i>that Kai Winn is on her way</i>
<i>to the station.</i>

256
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,879
<i>She should arrive</i>
<i>in less than two hours.</i>

257
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,214
Thank you, Chief.

258
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,257
Major Kira will greet her
at the airlock.

259
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,300
Make my apologies.

260
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,260
Tell the Kai

261
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,138
that I am busy today,
but I'll meet with her tomorrow.

262
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,097
Tell...

263
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,016
Make something up.

264
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,100
Where are you going to be?

265
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,606
Right here.

266
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,817
The answer
is in this spire.

267
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,985
I know it.

268
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,753
Kai Winn.

269
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,629
Greetings, my child.

270
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,965
You look...
very sweet.

271
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,342
Looks can be deceiving.

272
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,636
But you don't need me
to tell you that.

273
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,180
Why isn't the Emissary
here to greet me?

274
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,600
I'm afraid Captain Sisko's
busy at the moment.

275
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,435
Still basking
in the adulation

276
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,977
of Starfleet Command.

277
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,396
Well, something like that.

278
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:39,814
I'm sure the Federation

279
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,982
is very pleased
with the job he's done.

280
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,568
I thought everyone was.

281
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:46,153
Well, not<i> everyone.</i>

282
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,614
You know, our culture

283
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,908
has had only
five short years

284
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,910
to recover from
the occupation.

285
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,704
Only five years
of freedom.

286
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,664
It hardly seems
enough time, does it?

287
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,207
Well, Bajor's still
going to be free.

288
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,460
Joining the Federation
isn't going to change that.

289
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,589
I see working beside
Captain Sisko all these years

290
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,674
has had quite
an influence on you.

291
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,384
I have to give you credit.

292
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,470
You just never give up.

293
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,888
I'm sure the Emissary

294
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,514
will consider everything
you have to say

295
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,476
and then Bajor's admittance
can go forward--

296
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,060
unobstructed.

297
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,062
I await the will
of the Prophets.

298
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,860
(<i> sighs</i> )

299
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,040
Yes.

300
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,673
Hello, Ben.

301
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:49,968
Kasidy.

302
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,052
Jake said I could
find you here--

303
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,977
Something wrong?

304
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:00,687
Uh, no, not at all.

305
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,480
I'm just a little surprised.

306
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,481
I didn't know

307
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:04,858
you'd be happy
to see me.

308
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,109
What are you doing
for the next few hours?

309
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,486
I don't know.

310
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:09,988
I just got here.

311
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,365
Why don't you come
to Bajor with me?

312
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,741
Right now?

313
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,243
I think I know where
to find B'hala--

314
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,954
the sacred lost city
of Bajor.

315
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,832
You see these
markings here?

316
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,750
They're a coordinate system

317
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,836
keyed to mark
the position of stars

318
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:27,547
at a certain time
of night.

319
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,256
You don't have
the faintest idea

320
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,009
of what I'm talking
about, do you?

321
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,218
Uh, not a clue.

322
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,470
Well, why don't you
come to Bajor

323
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,222
and I will show you.

324
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,850
I'm not even sure
where I'm staying yet.

325
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,852
You can have
your old quarters.

326
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:43,855
If you want them.

327
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:45,439
They're still available?

328
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,734
Everything is just
as you left it.

329
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,319
I have some pull
with the station's C.O.

330
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,279
Ben...

331
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,781
I've missed you.

332
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,034
I'm glad you're back.

333
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:58,327
Now, what do you say
we go find B'hala?

334
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,581
Somehow, I don't think
you'll take no for an answer.

335
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,765
This way.

336
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:37,825
Uh, we must be 200
meters underground.

337
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,744
I don't want
to be negative, Ben

338
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,288
but this doesn't look
like a lost city to me.

339
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:45,750
You're looking at 20,000
years of sediment here.

340
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,126
Come on. Stay close.

341
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,295
We're not far from...

342
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,338
Oh, what's the matter?

343
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,506
It's nothing.

344
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,926
I'll be all right
in a second.

345
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:57,095
Julian said
that headaches

346
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,806
might be a side effect
of the accident.

347
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:03,142
Or obsessing over
an ancient Bajoran city--

348
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,894
is that a side effect, too?

349
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,980
You're being
negative again.

350
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,939
Come on.

351
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:10,024
It's just around the bend.

352
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,374
What is it?

353
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,919
B'hala.

354
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,923
Ben, it's a wall
of stone.

355
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,216
But what's
behind the wall?

356
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:12,670
These quarters are
not appropriate

357
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,880
for Admiral Colti.

358
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,214
She outranks
Admiral Veta.

359
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,758
Then we'll put her
in H-2,

360
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,553
Veta in D-9,
and Rifkin in K-4.

361
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,929
That will not do.

362
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,556
Rifkin commands
a starship.

363
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,017
Protocol requires he
be given equal quarters.

364
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:27,351
But he's only a Captain.

365
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,020
It is naval tradition.

366
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,230
So is keelhauling,
but right now,

367
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,607
we should focus
on accommodations.

368
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,110
Don't you agree, Major?

369
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,111
Major?

370
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,112
Hmm?

371
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,697
I'm sorry.

372
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:42,783
I didn't mean
to interrupt your reverie.

373
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,870
I was just thinking about
Captain Sisko finding B'hala.

374
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,247
Bajoran archaeologists
have been searching

375
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,541
for the sacred city
for 10,000 years.

376
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,585
He found it
in just a few days.

377
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,295
Your gods have granted the
Captain a powerful vision.

378
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,174
Or else he made
a very lucky guess.

379
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,717
It's a sign.

380
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,802
A sign from the Prophets.

381
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,346
I wonder if the Prophets
can help us

382
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,640
find quarters
for Captain Rifkin.

383
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,435
I hope I'm not
interrupting.

384
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:13,522
I was wondering, could I have
a word with you, Major?

385
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,066
Of course.

386
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,776
Good luck.

387
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,570
I was about to say
the same to you.

388
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,329
Child,

389
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:32,792
you and the Emissary
are close, are you not?

390
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,711
I consider Captain Sisko
a friend.

391
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,337
So you know his mind,

392
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,673
how he thinks,
how he reacts

393
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,341
in certain situations.

394
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:45,054
I'm not really sure
what you're asking.

395
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:49,225
I'm asking if you
think the Emissary
will forgive me.

396
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,936
Forgive you?

397
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:54,480
For doubting him.

398
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,817
He must have been
aware that I never

399
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:01,154
truly believed he
was the Emissary.

400
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,197
I'm sure
it crossed his mind.

401
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:05,574
Well, I was wrong.
I know that now.

402
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,952
Only someone touched
by the Prophets

403
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,829
could have found B'hala.

404
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,498
Does that mean you're not
going to try to block

405
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,750
Bajor's admittance
into the Federation?

406
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,502
I'm going
to follow the path

407
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,963
the Emissary has
laid out for us.

408
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,510
I...

409
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,096
I-I must admit,

410
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,765
I'm surprised to hear that.

411
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,852
It takes a lot of courage
to admit you're wrong.

412
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:36,230
And you think
I lack courage?

413
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,816
I didn't say that.

414
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:41,401
But it is
what you think.

415
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:44,905
Those of you who were
in the resistance,

416
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,615
you're all the same.

417
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,366
You think you're
the only ones

418
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,286
who fought the Cardassians.

419
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:54,165
That you saved Bajor
single-handedly.

420
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:55,833
Perhaps you
forget, Major

421
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:58,544
the Cardassians arrested
any Bajoran found

422
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,963
to be teaching the
word of the Prophets.

423
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:05,301
I was in a Cardassian
prison camp for five years

424
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:10,681
and I can remember each and
every beating I suffered,

425
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:14,143
and while you had
your weapons to protect you,

426
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:16,770
all I had was my faith

427
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,356
and my courage.

428
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,819
Walk with the Prophets, child.

429
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,363
I know I will.

430
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,343
Hello, Admiral.

431
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:51,555
Ben. So this is
the ancient city of Balla.

432
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:52,639
B'hala.

433
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,895
Missing for 20,000 years,
and you found it.

434
00:23:57,895 --> 00:23:59,688
Pretty impressive.

435
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:04,193
Sure as hell
impressed the Bajorans.

436
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,986
How'd you know
where to look?

437
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,239
You might say
it came to me in a vision.

438
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,531
I know that's

439
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,284
what the Bajorans think,

440
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:14,412
but just between me and you,
what really happened?

441
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:18,249
I know it's hard to understand,

442
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:20,418
but it really was a vision.

443
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:22,502
For the past few
days, I've had

444
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,005
these moments of insights...

445
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,800
flashes of understanding.

446
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,010
And they started
after that accident.

447
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,763
I don't know, Ben.

448
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:34,472
This is a little strange.

449
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:37,268
You didn't come here to see
B'hala, did you, Admiral?

450
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:39,019
No.

451
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,563
I came to see you

452
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,816
and I was surprised
you weren't on the station

453
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,109
when I arrived.

454
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,073
I'm sorry about that.

455
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:52,825
Not sorry enough

456
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,244
to return my com signals--
all three of them.

457
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:58,372
That could get an officer
in a lot of trouble.

458
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,626
Look, Ben...

459
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,338
I need to know
that I can count on you.

460
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:08,257
Now, Bajor's admission
is only the beginning.

461
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:10,217
Now comes the hard part.

462
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:13,137
Federation Council members
have to be chosen.

463
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:14,430
The Bajoran militia

464
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,640
has to be absorbed
into Starfleet.

465
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,017
There are thousands

466
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,186
of details
that have to be overseen,

467
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,146
and you're
our point man here.

468
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:25,191
That means we need to depend
on you more than ever.

469
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:26,442
Don't worry.

470
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,361
I won't let you down.

471
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:29,820
I'm glad to hear that.

472
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,947
Now what do you say we get
back up to the station?

473
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:35,034
I can't go back to the
station, not just yet.

474
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,619
Why not? I'm sure the Bajorans
can take it from here.

475
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,373
Or were you thinking
of digging up this entire city

476
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:41,707
all by yourself?

477
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,209
Charlie...

478
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:46,045
I just need a little more time.

479
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,505
For what?

480
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:49,089
For answers.

481
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:52,176
There's... there's clarity here.

482
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:55,095
I-I wish
I could explain it better

483
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,638
but I can't!

484
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,392
You're scaring me
with this, Ben.

485
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:02,395
I'm a little scared,
too, Admiral.

486
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,275
All right.

487
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,528
I'll give you some time,

488
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:14,448
but I want you back on the
station by 0700 hours tomorrow.

489
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:17,243
You're to report to Dr. Bashir
for a complete physical.

490
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,162
I'll be there.

491
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,372
Good.

492
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,980
It's 0715.

493
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,399
Where the hell is he?

494
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,317
His runabout only docked
25 minutes ago, sir.

495
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,360
I'm sure he's on his way.

496
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,610
When he gets here

497
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,071
I want you to give
him a full workup.

498
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:55,948
I examined him
before he left for Bajor.

499
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,783
He didn't complain
of any new symptoms

500
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:01,078
but my scan still showed the
same odd synaptic potentials.

501
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:03,205
I was hoping the problem
would have cured itself by now.

502
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:04,664
But it hasn't.

503
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,166
Isn't there something
you can do to help?

504
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,922
I could try
neuropolaric induction

505
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:14,467
but that's
a very serious operation

506
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,135
and I'd rather not do that

507
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,471
unless it were
absolutely necessary.

508
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:21,639
So in the meantime, he's going
to keep having visions.

509
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,850
I knew we were
headed for trouble

510
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,186
the minute
he allowed the Bajorans

511
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,521
to call him "Emissary."

512
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:29,689
He didn't have much choice.

513
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,525
The Bajorans
are deeply committed

514
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:32,610
to their spirituality,

515
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,694
not to mention
incredibly stubborn.

516
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,281
They believe that Captain Sisko
is the Emissary

517
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:38,907
and nothing's going
to change their minds.

518
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,034
(<i> clamoring outside</i> )

519
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,423
I told you he'd
be here, sir.

520
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,887
There's no need to worry.

521
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:04,391
The katterpod harvest will
be much better this year.

522
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:13,526
You don't belong here.

523
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:14,734
Go home.

524
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,071
(<i> gasping</i> )

525
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,156
(<i> crowd murmuring</i> )

526
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:20,616
Captain.

527
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,159
What's wrong?

528
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,577
I'm fine.

529
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,290
Admiral.

530
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,417
What is it, Ben?

531
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,960
Your son.

532
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,047
You can stop worrying
about him.

533
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,923
He forgives you.

534
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,639
How the hell did he know

535
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:46,225
that Kevin and I
weren't getting along?

536
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,726
He's the Emissary.

537
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:58,529
That should do it.

538
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:00,822
I'll have the test results
in a few minutes.

539
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:06,786
Well, that wasn't so bad,
was it?

540
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,208
Captain?

541
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,086
Cardassia.

542
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,671
Sir?

543
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:20,008
That's where it was going--
the cloud.

544
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,343
What cloud?

545
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,303
I was on Bajor.

546
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,804
B'hala had been rebuilt.

547
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,641
The people were in the streets
celebrating,

548
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:30,269
but then,
a shadow covered the sun.

549
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:33,480
We looked up
and saw a cloud filling the sky.

550
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,357
It was a swarm of locusts--

551
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:36,609
billions of them.

552
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,944
They hovered
above the city.

553
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,779
The noise was deafening.

554
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,741
But, just as quickly
as they came, they moved on.

555
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:47,035
Now I know where
they were going, Cardassia.

556
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,662
What do you
think it means?

557
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:49,955
I don't know.

558
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,248
At least the swarm

559
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:52,666
was moving away
from Bajor.

560
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:55,753
That's a good sign--
isn't it?

561
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:57,837
But what do the locusts
represent?

562
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,256
And why Cardassia?

563
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:00,424
You were dreaming

564
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:01,925
and dreams don't always
make sense.

565
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,927
This was no dream.

566
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,345
Captain,
why didn't you tell me

567
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,639
about these headaches
of yours?

568
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:08,766
I guess I was too busy.

569
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:12,144
Well, if you'd stayed...
busy much longer,

570
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,062
you could have died.

571
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,690
The area of unusual
neural activity

572
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,234
has increased
another eight percent.

573
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,487
As a result, your basal ganglia
are starting to depolarize.

574
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:22,862
I'm going to have to operate--

575
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,948
try to repolarize

576
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,366
your neural sheaths.

577
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,494
How will that affect my visions?

578
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:30,496
That's not really
the issue here, is it?

579
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:32,038
It is to me.

580
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,290
Doctor?

581
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:36,502
Well, there's no way
to tell for sure,

582
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:40,172
but I assume if I can complete
the procedure,

583
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:43,592
your brain activity
will return to normal,

584
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:45,761
and the visions will stop.

585
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,350
Then you can't do it.

586
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,059
Ben, that's ridiculous.

587
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:58,940
<i>If</i> I don't operate,
sir...

588
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,776
you could die.

589
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:03,696
I understand that,

590
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:07,449
but something
is happening to me--

591
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:09,868
something extraordinary.

592
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:15,415
I have to see it through.

593
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,667
What do you mean
you're not going

594
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:17,917
to let Dr. Bashir
operate on you?

595
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,086
You have to.

596
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,630
Don't you see?

597
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,465
These visions
are gifts.

598
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,384
I can't refuse them.

599
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:28,261
I cannot believe
what I'm hearing.

600
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:31,557
Listen to yourself, Ben,
sitting there telling us

601
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:34,727
that this mystical journey
of yours is more important

602
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:37,646
than watching
your son grow up.

603
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:41,400
Dad, please think
about what you're doing.

604
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,610
These visions...

605
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,904
they're not worth dying for.

606
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,990
I remember...

607
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,578
the first time
I held you in my hands...

608
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:56,122
you were only a few minutes old

609
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,834
and I looked down at your face,

610
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,628
and it was almost
as if I could see

611
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:04,381
your whole life
stretched out

612
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,258
in front of you--

613
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:09,845
all the joys it would bring,

614
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:13,181
and the bruises...

615
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,350
it was all there,

616
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:20,146
hidden in that
scrunched-up little face.

617
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:27,279
The baby that I'm holding
in my hands now...

618
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,324
is the universe itself

619
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:36,455
and I need time
to study its face.

620
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,998
Look at the face of your son now

621
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,125
and then tell me

622
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,628
you're doing the right thing.

623
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,504
(<i> door chimes</i> )

624
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,172
Come in.

625
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:54,055
It's time, Emissary,
if you're ready.

626
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:57,309
I am.

627
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,435
Ready for what?

628
00:32:58,435 --> 00:32:59,603
WINN:
The Emissary

629
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:01,563
has asked for help
in his journey.

630
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,231
I'm providing it.

631
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,151
And you trust her?

632
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,653
Since when?

633
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:12,282
Jake...

634
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:14,993
it'll be all right.

635
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:26,379
I love you--

636
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,840
both of you.

637
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,775
I've never seen the temple
so crowded.

638
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,151
Seemed like every Bajoran
on the station

639
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,778
was there to pray
for the Emissary.

640
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,154
Glad to hear it.

641
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,239
He's going to need
all the help he can get

642
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,825
if he's going to survive this.

643
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:56,284
The Captain is not
going to die.

644
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,285
He is the Emissary.

645
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,453
The Prophets will take

646
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,454
care of him.

647
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,956
With all due respect, Major,

648
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:02,958
I'd rather see Julian
take care of him.

649
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,961
Chief, I know you're worried,

650
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:08,630
but the Prophets are leading
the Emissary

651
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,882
on this path for a reason.

652
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:12,551
Do not attempt
to convince them, Major.

653
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,093
They cannot understand.

654
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,971
Since when did you believe
in the Prophets?

655
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:20,058
What I believe in...

656
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:23,854
is faith.

657
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:26,023
Without it, there
can be no victory.

658
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:27,733
If the Captain's
faith is strong,

659
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,442
he will prevail.

660
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,486
That's not much
to bet his life on.

661
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,823
You're wrong.

662
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:36,700
It's everything.

663
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,579
I hope you're right, Major.

664
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:41,914
I hope you're right.

665
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,126
He asks for your guidance.

666
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:50,630
Let him see with your eyes.

667
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:54,092
Lift the veil of darkness
that obscures his path.

668
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,181
Emissary?

669
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:04,352
I'm ready.

670
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,024
(<i> cries out</i> )

671
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:14,780
The Orb of Prophecy
is very powerful.

672
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,198
It taxes even the healthy.

673
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,325
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

674
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,703
I have to.

675
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:26,750
I need to bring
the visions into focus...

676
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,710
tie them together.

677
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,337
I can't do it alone.

678
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,465
But you're very weak.

679
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:36,301
Perhaps it would be better
to wait 'till after the signing.

680
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,511
I may not have time.

681
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:41,306
I need to do it now.

682
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,266
As you wish.

683
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:47,104
May the Prophets reveal
their wisdom to you, Emissary.

684
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:15,173
He's already an hour late.

685
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,010
He's still consulting
the Orb of Prophecy.

686
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,846
How long do these
Orb experiences last?

687
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:24,766
Minutes. Hours.
Sometimes days.

688
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,810
Then maybe we shouldn't
wait for him.

689
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,603
Do you have any objections
to proceeding

690
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,188
without Captain Sisko?

691
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,900
I'm sure the Emissary
would want to be here...

692
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,486
but under
the circumstances...

693
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,415
May I have your attention?

694
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:53,128
I've been looking forward
to this day for many years

695
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:55,296
as I'm sure all of you have.

696
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:58,091
Welcoming a new planet
to the Federation

697
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:00,677
is the happiest assignment
an Admiral could hope for.

698
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:04,097
The Federation is not just
a union of planets.

699
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,224
It's much more. It--

700
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,977
Emissary!

701
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,687
Get him
to the Infirmary.

702
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,939
No. I have
to tell them.

703
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,566
What is it, Emissary?

704
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,235
Have the Prophets
revealed something to you?

705
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,114
Locusts...

706
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:22,657
they'll destroy Bajor

707
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,283
unless it stands alone.

708
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,703
Ben, what the hell
are you talking about?

709
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,538
It's too soon!

710
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:30,874
Bajor must not join
the Federation.

711
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:34,335
If it does,
it will be destroyed.

712
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,642
His entire central
nervous system
is depolarizing.

713
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,561
We have to operate
immediately.

714
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:53,105
Then what are
you waiting for?

715
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,355
Captain Sisko
made it clear

716
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,066
he didn't
want surgery.

717
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:58,235
What are you
suggesting, Major?

718
00:37:58,235 --> 00:38:00,319
We stand around
and let him die?

719
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:04,574
It isn't about what
I want or what you want.
It's about Captain Sisko.

720
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:06,993
And he told us that
he doesn't want anything

721
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,495
interfering with his visions.

722
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,414
Major, these visions
may be important,

723
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,416
but I think
we're all in agreement here

724
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:16,962
that they are<i> not</i> as important
as Captain Sisko's life.

725
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:18,337
Start
the procedures.

726
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,798
It's not that simple.

727
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:22,008
Captain Sisko refused surgery

728
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,010
and I can't go against
the decision of my patient--

729
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,429
not without
the express consent

730
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,889
of his closest relative.

731
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:34,146
I guess that means
it's up to me.

732
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,364
Dad...

733
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:48,534
I know you want to see
this thing to the end...

734
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:53,039
but...

735
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,335
I need you.

736
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,185
I'm sorry.

737
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,361
Do what you have to do.

738
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,988
Prepare for surgery.

739
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:26,823
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to ask
you all to leave.

740
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:29,242
Nurse.

741
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,097
Any news
about the Emissary?

742
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,765
He's still in surgery.

743
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,226
(<i> sighs</i> )

744
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:56,769
I hope the Prophets
will forgive us.

745
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:01,233
We never should have allowed
the Federation to interfere
with the Emissary's visions.

746
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:02,525
It wasn't the Federation.

747
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,027
It was his son and
he had every right

748
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:06,238
to make that decision.

749
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:07,989
It was a selfish act.

750
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,615
He's an 18-year-old boy

751
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,076
who doesn't want
to lose his father.

752
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:12,911
What would you have
done in his place?

753
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:18,208
I would trust the Prophets.

754
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:21,669
Maybe we're the ones who need
to trust the Prophets.

755
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,339
For all we know,
this is part of their plan.

756
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:26,883
Maybe... maybe they've told
Captain Sisko

757
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:29,261
everything
they<i> want</i> him to know.

758
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:31,012
Perhaps.

759
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,805
I suppose you heard

760
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:36,601
that Bajor will
not join the Federation today.

761
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:37,936
The Council

762
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,854
of Ministers has voted
to delay acceptance

763
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,814
of Federation membership.

764
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,109
You must be very pleased.

765
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:45,610
I wish I were

766
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:49,906
but things are not that simple,
not anymore.

767
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:55,995
Before Captain Sisko found
B'hala, my path was clear.

768
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,373
I knew who my enemies were.

769
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:02,335
But now...
now, nothing is certain.

770
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:05,588
Makes life interesting,
doesn't it?

771
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:16,391
No...

772
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:19,727
(<i> voice breaking</i> ):
No! You took them away!

773
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,105
We had no choice.

774
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:23,982
You were dying.

775
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:26,109
I almost had it.

776
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:29,904
Almost understood it all.

777
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,615
Now it's gone.

778
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,221
(<i> door chimes</i> )

779
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,473
Yes.

780
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:01,978
How are you feeling?

781
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:04,689
I'm fine, Admiral.

782
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:08,276
Look, Ben, it's
not too late.

783
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:11,196
You could contact the
Chamber of Ministers--

784
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:13,072
tell them you were wrong.

785
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,992
Convince them to accept
Federation membership.

786
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:19,787
I can't do that.

787
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,499
The visions may have faded.

788
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:27,337
Everything I said,
everything I did
still feels right.

789
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:31,007
When I said that Bajor
should wait before it
joins the Federation,

790
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:34,927
I have never felt so certain
about anything in my life.

791
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,805
I was afraid
you would say that, Ben.

792
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,809
I could have
your commission for this.

793
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,811
I know.

794
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:46,439
But considering
how the Bajorans feel about you,

795
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:48,649
if I pulled you from this post,

796
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,943
we'd probably
lose Bajor forever.

797
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,862
(<i> sighs</i> )

798
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:55,656
Admiral, for what it's worth,

799
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:58,410
I wish things
had turned out differently.

800
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,994
So do I.

801
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,829
But it's not over.

802
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,457
One day, Bajor<i> will</i> join
the Federation.

803
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:06,459
<i>That</i> I'm sure of.

804
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,380
Are you speaking
as a Starfleet Captain,

805
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,465
or as the Emissary
of the Prophets?

806
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,468
Both.

807
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:17,220
In that case,

808
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,389
I'll keep the champagne on ice.

809
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:26,271
(<i> door opens</i> )

810
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,525
Just in time, Dad.

811
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,487
What's this all about?

812
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:35,905
It's about jambalaya.

813
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:40,368
We never had that "welcome back"
dinner for Kasidy.

814
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,829
Welcome back...

815
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:47,417
the both of us.

816
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,672
Ben, I can't say
I understand

817
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:55,550
what you've gone through.

818
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,094
I know you feel you've lost
something important

819
00:43:58,094 --> 00:44:00,179
and maybe you have.

820
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,639
But believe me...

821
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:09,105
you've held on
to something important as well.
