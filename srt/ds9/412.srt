1
00:00:01,376 --> 00:00:04,296
<i>Last time on</i>
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...

2
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:07,007
It'll be good to have
you home again, Benjamin.

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:11,345
Dad, you know that this
isn't exactly a vacation.

4
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,472
I'll be spending most of my time
in San Francisco

5
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:14,849
at Starfleet Headquarters.

6
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,101
Ben, Earth is in danger.

7
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,603
Something has
to be done

8
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:21,188
about these
shape-shifters.

9
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,397
You know more
about the Dominion

10
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,149
than anyone in Starfleet.

11
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:27,778
And so, effective immediately,
I'm making you acting head

12
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,571
of Starfleet Security
here on Earth.

13
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,536
Forgive the intrusion,
Mr. President,

14
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,204
but as you can see, Starfleet

15
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,789
has every right
to be concerned.

16
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,457
SISKO:
If Odo was
a Dominion infiltrator

17
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,501
he could've killed you.

18
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:45,170
You actually thought I was
one of them, didn't you?

19
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,507
I don't know.
I wasn't sure.

20
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:51,176
This business has got you
so twisted around,

21
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,178
you, you can't think straight.

22
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,722
A changeling
infiltrated

23
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,515
the grounds of
Starfleet Headquarters,

24
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,058
imitated the Admiral,
and got away scot-free.

25
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,185
Our security measures
aren't working.

26
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,980
We're doing everything
the president will let us do.

27
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,857
Maybe that's not enough.

28
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:06,692
Earth's entire
power relay system's

29
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,694
been knocked
off line.

30
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:11,321
In other words,
Earth is defenseless.

31
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,324
What you're asking me to do
is declare martial law.

32
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,952
What I'm asking you to do
is let us defend this planet.

33
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,328
You'd better come
take a look at this.

34
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,831
Take a look at what?
Come on.

35
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:29,048
<i>And now, the conclusion.</i>

36
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,764
I don't like this.

37
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:38,515
The more I read
Starfleet's reports

38
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,517
on the sabotage
of the power relays,

39
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,770
the more unanswered
questions I have.

40
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,230
How were the changelings
able to infiltrate

41
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,441
the Division
of Planetary Operations?

42
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:48,901
Where did they get the codes

43
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:51,695
for the division's
computer control network?

44
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,906
And how did
they manage to disable

45
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:56,909
every power relay on Earth
at the same time?

46
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,244
Captain, have
you ever heard

47
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,538
of a group
called Red Squad?

48
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,874
They're an elite team
of Starfleet cadets.

49
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,209
According to Nog,
every student at the Academy

50
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,377
wants to be a part of it.

51
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,796
Oh.

52
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,380
Well, that explains it.

53
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,633
Explains what?

54
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:15,010
Well, according
to this transporter log,

55
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,220
a group called "Red Squad"
was beamed back

56
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,598
to Starfleet Academy,
26 minutes

57
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,559
after the state of
emergency was declared.

58
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,853
That's strange.

59
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,106
During the blackout,
Starfleet mobilized
hundreds of units.

60
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:28,816
Why would they
demobilize Red Squad?

61
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,859
That's why I
brought it up.

62
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,945
But if they're cadets,
I suppose Starfleet

63
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:34,696
wanted to get them
out of harm's way.

64
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,366
(<i> keypad beeping</i> )

65
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,201
If that's true,
how do you explain this?

66
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:43,122
Three hours later,
Starfleet Command
issued an order

67
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:46,333
assigning the entire corps
of cadets to field duty.

68
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:50,129
Which means they weren't
bringing Red Squad home

69
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:51,797
for their protection.

70
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,298
So the question is,

71
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,717
why would they
demobilize Red Squad,

72
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,846
only to mobilize them
again three hours later?

73
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:04,225
Lights.

74
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,561
Are you sure reopening
the restaurant is a good idea?

75
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,272
Jake, it's been
four days since
the power outage.

76
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:13,652
Have you seen
any Dominion invasion fleet?

77
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,362
No.

78
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:18,239
Neither have I.
Besides, at my age

79
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,869
I don't have time to waste
sitting at home being bored.

80
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,662
You know, there's hardly anyone
on the streets.

81
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,413
You're not going
to have any customers.

82
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,374
Oh, I've got plenty
of customers.

83
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,667
Just look outside.

84
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,678
All I see are security officers.

85
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,471
And I bet not one of them

86
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,640
has had a good meal
in four days.

87
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,392
(<i> chuckling</i> )

88
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,644
Now, you do your grandfather
a favor

89
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,771
and start chopping up the okra.

90
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:55,694
Captain Sisko, is there
something I can do for you?

91
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,155
I need to talk to you
about Red Squad.

92
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,823
Go on.

93
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,534
Are you aware there's
a transporter record

94
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,244
of Red Squad
being returned

95
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,997
to the Academy
not long after the power outage?

96
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:10,209
Are you saying that's
in the<i> official</i> records?

97
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,459
That's right.

98
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,587
Is this a secure line?

99
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,047
It is at my end.

100
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:16,631
One moment.

101
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,720
Sorry, Captain,
but I think

102
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,431
you'll agree that this is
a time for caution.

103
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,933
Absolutely.

104
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,143
Does Admiral Leyton
know about this report?

105
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,853
He hasn't mentioned it to me.

106
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,688
Listen to me, Captain.

107
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,941
I want that record erased

108
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,650
before anyone else
can see it.

109
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,152
Is that understood?

110
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:39,654
I'll take care of it
immediately.

111
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,990
Good. That report
could cause us a lot of trouble.

112
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,618
I'm glad you spotted it.
So am I.

113
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,411
I'd hate to see
the members of Red Squad

114
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,704
get into any trouble.

115
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,330
They're fine
young men and women.

116
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,542
When Leyton talked to me
about using them,

117
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,253
I thought it was a mistake,

118
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:57,422
but I must admit, they performed
their mission admirably.

119
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,967
I appreciate
your call, Captain.

120
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,843
I'm in your debt.

121
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:09,101
Well...

122
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:13,730
that certainly raised more
questions than it answered.

123
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,482
(<i> sighs</i> )

124
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,396
What did I tell you?

125
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,606
As human as I ever was.

126
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,782
SISKO:
You seem pretty
jovial today.

127
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,326
Well, is there
a problem with that?

128
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,745
It's just...

129
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,455
Well, you didn't
seem too happy

130
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,457
about being tested
a few days ago.

131
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,793
Well, that was before
the changelings

132
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,586
sabotaged the power grid.

133
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,879
I know, but you
have to admit

134
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,505
you were pretty
adamant about it.

135
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,217
I don't understand you.

136
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:50,304
When I didn't want to be tested,
you made it an issue.

137
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:54,141
Now that I'm cooperating,
you're still not satisfied.

138
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,517
It's not you, Dad.

139
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,395
Then what is it?

140
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,521
I'm not sure.

141
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,649
Maybe I'm just
being paranoid.

142
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,776
Uh, Captain, Jake said
you wanted to see me.

143
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,446
Yes, I do.

144
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:08,738
Uh, you two talk.

145
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,949
I'll go chill some tube grubs.

146
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,371
What can I do for you, sir?

147
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,248
It's about Red Squad.

148
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,292
Red Squad?
Did you get me in?

149
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:21,835
Not just yet.

150
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,711
Oh, too bad.
Those guys are the best.

151
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,255
They're the only people I know

152
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,132
who aren't afraid
of the Dominion.

153
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,675
Why is that?

154
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,678
I don't know.

155
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,847
They're not scared
of anything, I guess.

156
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,723
You seem to know
them pretty well.

157
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,977
Jake told me I should try
to get to know them better--

158
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,937
show them that I'm a good guy.

159
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,315
And so far,
it seems to be working.

160
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:46,234
The truth is, I think
they only like me
because I know you.

161
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,819
Is that so?

162
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,489
You're kind of their hero--
the man at the front line

163
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,032
in the war with the Dominion.

164
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,409
I'd like to meet
some of these cadets.

165
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,454
You think you could
introduce me to one of them?

166
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,664
I'm sorry.
I can't do that, sir.

167
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:03,377
The names of Red Squad members
are supposed to be secret.

168
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,003
But you know who they are.

169
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:08,465
It's not easy keeping
secrets from a Ferengi.

170
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,925
But I feel funny
telling anyone else.

171
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,802
Besides, if they found out
I told you who they were,

172
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,929
I'd never get in.

173
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,765
Cadet, you are obviously
under the mistaken impression

174
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,351
that I am asking a favor.

175
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:22,312
I want a name, and I want it
now, and that is an order.

176
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,646
Understood, Mr. Nog?

177
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,149
Yes, sir.

178
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,364
Cadet Shepard reporting
as ordered, Captain.

179
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,032
Riley Aldrin Shepard...

180
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:39,079
Starfleet service
number C953O4699427,

181
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,331
a third-year student
at Starfleet Academy

182
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,208
with a specialty
in tactical operations.

183
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,085
Yes, sir.

184
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,380
Cadet, I have been
reviewing a record

185
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,882
of Red Squad activities
on the night of the 23rd--

186
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,675
the night of
the power outage.

187
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,344
Record, sir?
We were told

188
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,762
there was not going to be
any written record.

189
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,222
Are you contradicting me, Cadet?

190
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,307
No, sir.

191
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,268
Good. Now who told you there
wasn't to be a written record?

192
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,936
The briefing officer, sir.

193
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,563
I want that officer's name.

194
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:06,398
She didn't give us
her name, sir,

195
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,525
but she did say there would be
no record of our actions,

196
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,819
and that our role would
have to go unrecognized,
at least for now.

197
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,739
Maybe if you'd done your
job better, it would have.

198
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:15,907
But you fouled it up,
didn't you?

199
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,826
You cadets did
some sloppy work--

200
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,912
some<i> damn</i> sloppy work.

201
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,747
With all due respect, sir...
that's not true, sir.

202
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,583
The mission went
perfectly.

203
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,960
If anything, it was easier
than the simulations.

204
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,003
Now, son, if you think
by lying to me,

205
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:32,048
you're going to save your own
hide, you'd better forget it.

206
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,135
Mistakes were made, and I will
find out who's responsible.

207
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,471
I'm not lying to you, sir.

208
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,055
I was there.

209
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,182
I was at Planetary
Operations the whole time.

210
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,351
If anything had gone wrong,
I would have known about it.

211
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,353
Is that so?

212
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:49,023
All right, Cadet,
let's go over this step by step,

213
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:52,068
from the time
of your mission deployment

214
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,988
to your return to base
at 1947 hours PST

215
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,157
on the night of the 23rd.

216
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,658
Yes, sir.

217
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,952
We assembled
on the eastern quad

218
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,788
at 1700 hours on
the evening of the 23rd.

219
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,166
I assume by "we,"
you mean Red Squad.

220
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:10,420
Yes, sir. After assembly, we
were beamed aboard the<i> Lakota.</i>

221
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,255
Once aboard,
we received our equipment

222
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,673
and the necessary
codes and were
transported directly

223
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:16,384
to the Division of Planetary
Operations in Lisbon.

224
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,885
At what time?

225
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:21,097
0400 hours, exactly--
local time, of course.

226
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,642
Go on, Cadet.

227
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,310
Our contact inside the DPO

228
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,646
gave us access to their
computer control network.

229
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:30,398
From there, we used the access
codes we were given,

230
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,108
bypassed
the security lockouts

231
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,818
and downloaded the
disordering protocols

232
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,029
into the network.

233
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,947
And from there,
the protocols spread

234
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,659
to every power relay
on the planet.

235
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,619
It was a pretty
impressive sight, sir,

236
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:45,330
watching those relays wink out
one after another.

237
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,831
Sorry I missed it.

238
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,210
After that, all
we had to do was

239
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,046
sabotage the restart sequencers
and get out.

240
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,965
Like I said, sir,
it was all by the numbers.

241
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,926
And are you sure
that this cadet

242
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,470
is telling
the truth?

243
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,139
He admitted to committing
acts of treason

244
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,516
against the Federation.

245
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,351
If he was going to lie,

246
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,229
I think he would have
made up a better story.

247
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,523
I take it that you gave
him a blood screening.

248
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,066
I tested him myself.

249
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,068
He's human.

250
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,695
Well, then let's say

251
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:18,405
he is telling
the truth--

252
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,408
that his superior
officers ordered him

253
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,868
to sabotage
the power relays.

254
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:28,707
That still doesn't rule
out Dominion involvement.

255
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:31,543
For all we know,
his superiors

256
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,712
have been replaced
by changelings.

257
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:35,380
I thought about that.

258
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:41,219
But if it were changelings,
what have they accomplished?

259
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:44,222
There's been no invasion
and power's been restored.

260
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,391
And Starfleet has
fortified Earth.

261
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:47,892
I see your point, Captain.

262
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,895
So, let's say you're right.

263
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:56,025
Starfleet officers have
sabotaged the power grid.

264
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,902
What are you going
to do about it?

265
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:03,491
That<i> is</i> the bottom line,
isn't it?

266
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,827
What am I going to do?

267
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,913
(<i> sighs</i> )

268
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:12,125
These aren't evil people, Odo.

269
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,087
These are people I worked with.

270
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,673
They're my friends...

271
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:21,342
people I respect.

272
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:25,054
How can I turn against them?

273
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,348
It seems to me...

274
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:31,060
if they<i> have</i> committed treason
against the Federation--

275
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,563
the Federation
that you swore to protect--

276
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,149
you won't be turning
against them.

277
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,026
<i>They</i> will have turned
against you.

278
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,953
Captain, I've been in
politics for 70 years.

279
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,790
I'm no stranger to overstatement
and exaggeration,

280
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,416
but the idea that Starfleet

281
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,419
would plot to overthrow
the Federation government

282
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,631
is the single most astonishing
accusation I have ever heard.

283
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,508
Sir, if you'll hear us out--

284
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,551
As I intend to,

285
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:07,263
but you'll forgive me
if I remain somewhat skeptical.

286
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,767
Now, you should start
at the beginning.

287
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,894
Several months
ago, I learned

288
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,105
from one of my people,
that changelings

289
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,940
had infiltrated
the Federation.

290
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,360
Not long after I gave
this information

291
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,028
to Starfleet,
reports indicate

292
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,322
that Admiral Leyton
led a contingent

293
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:26,700
of high-ranking officers
to meet with you

294
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,076
and recommend
implementation

295
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,830
of sweeping security measures
meant to protect Earth.

296
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,415
And I rejected their suggestions
as extreme.

297
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,125
It's no secret
that Leyton

298
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,253
disagreed with you,
and despite your calls for calm,

299
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,423
his concern about the Dominion
threat continued to grow.

300
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,842
When the Antwerp
Conference

301
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:46,010
was bombed,
Leyton became convinced

302
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,971
that the changelings posed
a greater threat to Earth

303
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,057
than you were prepared to admit.

304
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,310
And so Admiral Leyton
approached me again,

305
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,146
this time
with you two at his side,

306
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,774
and I agreed to his proposals.

307
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,108
To<i> some</i> of his proposals.

308
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,569
We believe that
Admiral Leyton

309
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,571
and his supporters
weren't satisfied

310
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:07,657
with the limited security
procedures you authorized.

311
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:10,034
They were convinced that
extraordinary measures

312
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,537
were needed to counter
the changeling threat.

313
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:13,830
More than that,
they were determined

314
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,998
to prove to you
and to everyone else

315
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:19,043
how vulnerable Earth was
to a Dominion takeover.

316
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,546
So they sabotaged
the global power grid...

317
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,841
Starfleet officers
committing sabotage?!

318
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,427
I know exactly how you feel,
but it's the truth.

319
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,599
I find that
difficult to believe.

320
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,934
Admiral Leyton
may be somewhat grating

321
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,519
and inflexible at times,

322
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,313
but for a man of
his accomplishments,

323
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,691
a man of his distinguished
record to commit treason?

324
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:44,485
I'm sure the Admiral
doesn't see it as treason.

325
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,405
He would probably defend it as
a desperate act of patriotism.

326
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,282
He and his supporters think

327
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,159
that their actions
are both necessary
and justified.

328
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,327
ODO:
Not to mention
effective.

329
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,328
Think about it.

330
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,247
The power grid fails,

331
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,416
and the next thing you know,
Starfleet security officers

332
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,586
are on the streets of every
city, armed with phaser rifles,

333
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,463
blood testing citizens
at random.

334
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,591
Your story has a certain logic
to it, gentlemen,

335
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,217
but what it lacks is proof.

336
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,052
You want proof?

337
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,388
Order Admiral Leyton to withdraw
his troops from the streets.

338
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,932
See what he does.

339
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,810
You think he would refuse
a direct order

340
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,311
from his Commander-in-Chief?

341
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,146
If he orders his troops
to stand down,

342
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:23,775
then I'm wrong,
and I'll offer my resignation,

343
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:26,026
but I don't think
that's going to happen.

344
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:29,447
With those troops in place,
Admiral Leyton controls Earth,

345
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,449
and he's not going
to give up that control

346
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:34,994
until he's convinced that he
has ended the Dominion threat.

347
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,455
He may not have
to give up anything.

348
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,290
If what you say is true--

349
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,835
if the power outage
was part of Leyton's plan--

350
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,377
then it's worked perfectly.

351
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,672
Right now, the public
overwhelmingly

352
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,674
supports the
increased security.

353
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,091
If I try to remove
those troops

354
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,593
over Leyton's
objection,

355
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:53,220
I'll have a planetwide
riot on my hands.

356
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,349
What if we bring you the proof?

357
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,852
Hard evidence linking Leyton

358
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,728
to the sabotage
of the power grid?

359
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,730
ODO:
With that, you
could force Leyton

360
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,024
to stand down,
<i>make</i> him withdraw the troops.

361
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:09,362
If what you say is true,
I'll have his resignation.

362
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:13,950
Bring me the evidence,
I promise I'll use it.

363
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,494
Sorry I'm late.

364
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:17,871
Where's Cadet
Shepard?

365
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,372
That's a good question.

366
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,915
I couldn't find him
anywhere.

367
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:23,001
What do you mean
you couldn't find him?

368
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,836
I mean, he's gone.

369
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:27,171
As far as I can tell, so is
every other member of Red Squad.

370
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,965
Uh, the rumor is
they've all been sent

371
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,800
on some kind
of training exercise.

372
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,760
(<i> door slams</i> )

373
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,428
I'm afraid Cadet Shepard

374
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,306
won't be returning to Earth
any time soon.

375
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,599
Admiral Leyton, it's...

376
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,810
Return to your quarters,
Cadet.

377
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,525
Ben...

378
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:50,069
I think you and I
have to talk...

379
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,112
in private.

380
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:55,282
I'll be in the next
room if you need me.

381
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,788
Mind if I get
a cup of coffee?

382
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,206
Help yourself.

383
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:07,253
I haven't been getting
a lot of sleep lately.

384
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,546
Too much to do.

385
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,965
Maybe you need
a vacation.

386
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,800
(<i> chuckling</i> )

387
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,639
Mmm.

388
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:23,143
Somehow, replicated coffee
never tastes this good.

389
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,068
(<i> sighs</i> )

390
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,657
I'm afraid I owe you
an apology, Ben.

391
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,284
The way I see it

392
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,286
you owe a lot of
people an apology.

393
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,580
I wish I could've told you
the truth from the beginning,

394
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,832
but somehow I suspected

395
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,543
we wouldn't see eye to eye
on this thing.

396
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,253
Then why did you
bring me here?

397
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,048
Because I needed someone
who knew how to fight

398
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,968
shape-shifters,
and that's you.

399
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,844
And I suppose on some level,

400
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,973
I hoped that when you saw
what we were accomplishing,

401
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:01,432
you'd join us.

402
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:04,978
You've always had
a strong sense of duty.

403
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,521
My duty is to protect
the Federation.

404
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,149
That's what we're trying to do.

405
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,444
What you're trying to do
is to seize control of Earth

406
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,863
and place it
under military rule.

407
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,866
If that's what it takes
to stop the Dominion.

408
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,327
So you're willing
to destroy paradise

409
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,578
in order to save it?

410
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,084
Remember when we were
on the<i> Okinawa</i>

411
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,710
fighting the Tzenkethi?

412
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,046
That time when I wanted
to take the ship

413
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:34,841
into an asteroid belt to chase
down those three raiders?

414
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,176
And I said it was
an unnecessary risk.

415
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,845
You spoke your mind.

416
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,430
Which is exactly
what a good executive officer

417
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,182
is supposed to do.

418
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,892
But I overruled you.

419
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,686
(<i> chuckling</i> )

420
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,730
After the staff meeting,
you followed me

421
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,733
into my ready room
and tried to argue

422
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,318
your point again.

423
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,403
That's right, I did.

424
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,197
And remember what I told you?

425
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:03,536
That a good officer must respect
the chain of command.

426
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,913
That there comes a time

427
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:09,291
when you must accept the orders
of a superior officer

428
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,960
and carry out those orders

429
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,420
whether you agree with them
or not.

430
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,049
I also told you
that when you became a CO,

431
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,466
you'd feel the same way.

432
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,510
And you were right--

433
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,639
about going after the Tzenkethi
and about me.

434
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,975
Without the chain of command,

435
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,811
Starfleet would cease
to function

436
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,939
and we wouldn't stand a chance
against our enemies.

437
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,447
I'm still
your commanding officer,

438
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,742
and now, more than ever,

439
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,494
I need you to respect
my authority.

440
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,788
And I cannot do that!

441
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,289
Not this time.

442
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:55,046
Then as of now, I'm relieving
you of your post

443
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:57,840
as temporary head
of Earth Security,

444
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,801
and sending you back
to Deep Space 9.

445
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,472
Go home, Ben.

446
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,725
You don't belong here.

447
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,608
Beautiful evening,
isn't it?

448
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:18,152
Chief, how'd
you get here?

449
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,737
You don't look so good.

450
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:22,281
You've a lot
on your mind, I bet.

451
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,075
How is your father?

452
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:26,660
There's no way the<i> Defiant</i>
could get here so soon.

453
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,413
I didn't say I came
on the<i> Defiant.</i>

454
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,915
Tell me the truth.

455
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:34,376
Do you really believe
that phaser rifles

456
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,546
will do any good
against shape-shifters?

457
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,298
You're not O'Brien.

458
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,674
Oh, luckily no.

459
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,135
The thought
of being locked

460
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:44,553
into one shape all the time,
it's, ooh...

461
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,555
it's unnatural.

462
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,808
Ah, don't bother
calling for help.

463
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,018
It'll only cut short
our conversation

464
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,937
and I do enjoy
your company.

465
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:56,023
If you have something
to say to me, say it.

466
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,943
Oh, you solids,
you are so impatient.

467
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:01,737
I-I thought we could
sit here for a while.

468
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,657
Maybe go to a bar, have a pint,
throw some darts.

469
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:05,992
I don't think so.

470
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:09,287
Let me ask you a question.

471
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:14,416
How many changelings do
you think are here on Earth

472
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,002
right at this moment?

473
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:19,130
I'm not going to play
any guessing games with you.

474
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,173
Ah.

475
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,091
What if I were
to tell you

476
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:26,220
that there are only four
on this entire planet?

477
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,680
Huh?

478
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,099
Not counting Constable Odo,
of course.

479
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,349
Think of it.

480
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,144
Just<i> four</i> of us,

481
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:36,063
and look at the havoc
we've wrought.

482
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:39,233
How do I know
you're telling me the truth?

483
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,735
Oh, four is more than enough.

484
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,030
We're smarter than solids.

485
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,200
We're better than you,
and most importantly,

486
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,288
<i>we</i> do not fear you
the way you fear<i> us.</i>

487
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:55,582
In the end, it's your fear
that will destroy you.

488
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:56,959
Are you finished?

489
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,418
Finished?

490
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,087
(<i> laughing</i> )

491
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,548
We've barely begun.

492
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,092
I'll be seeing you.

493
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:21,817
I recognize that look.

494
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,777
What look?

495
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,487
The one you're wearing--

496
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,573
the one that says,
"something's bothering me

497
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,783
and I don't know
what to do about it."

498
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,409
Oh. That look.

499
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:34,205
Do you want to
tell me about it?

500
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:35,622
I wish I could.

501
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,083
Oh, I see.

502
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,877
It's a Neffie Beumont-
kind of thing.

503
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,716
Neffie Beumont... whoo!

504
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,634
What a crush I had on her.

505
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,845
Not that you'd admit it.

506
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,098
You just sat
around for weeks

507
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:56,310
brooding and pining away,
trying to sort it all out

508
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,563
until your old man finally
sat you down one day

509
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,565
and gave you some advice.

510
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,110
"There comes a time
in every man's life

511
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,071
when he must stop thinking
and start doing."

512
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:10,032
And the next day,
you finally went over

513
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,492
to young Neffie's house
and asked her out.

514
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,412
And she turned me down.

515
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:17,290
But at least you weren't
brooding anymore.

516
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:20,542
And when Zoey Phillips
moved into the neighborhood

517
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,296
a few weeks later,
you asked her out

518
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:26,299
before her parents were done
beaming in the furniture.

519
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,508
And dated her for three years.

520
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,056
I guess what
you're telling me is

521
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:36,683
that I must stop brooding
and make a decision.

522
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,769
Exactly.

523
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:40,604
Thank you, Dad.

524
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,940
Don't mention it.

525
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,610
(<i> sighs</i> )

526
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,658
Make sure you turn
out the lights

527
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,743
on your way out.

528
00:24:57,163 --> 00:25:00,791
I wonder whatever happened
to Zoey Phillips?

529
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,966
(<i> whispering</i> ):
Zoey Phillips.

530
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,510
Captain, why are
you transmitting

531
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,679
on a Bajoran frequency?

532
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,140
We have things
we need to discuss

533
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,516
that I don't want
anyone else to hear.

534
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,978
What's your status?
Everything here is fine.

535
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,855
There's been no sign
of Dominion activity.

536
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,273
What about the wormhole?

537
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:26,108
It's acting normally again.

538
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,943
It stopped opening
and closing at random

539
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,320
not long after you left.

540
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,821
If any Dominion ships
did sneak through,

541
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:32,031
they're not giving us
any trouble.

542
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,407
Listen closely.

543
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,909
There's something
I need for you to do.

544
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,127
It's all yours.
I suggest you hurry.

545
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,962
I doubt it'll
take them very long

546
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,255
to discover
that we're here.

547
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,798
I never knew
it was so easy

548
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,342
to break into classified
Starfleet files.

549
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:53,844
ODO:
Everything I know
I learned from Quark.

550
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,846
SISKO:
Looks like Leyton's
been a busy man.

551
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:57,848
He's personally reassigned
over 400 officers

552
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:59,016
in the past three weeks.

553
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:01,310
Do you recognize
any of these names?

554
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,270
A lot of them.

555
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,981
Daneeka, McWatt...
Snowden, Orr, Moodus.

556
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,608
All of them were officers
on the<i> Okinawa</i>

557
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,610
when I was
Leyton's X.O.

558
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,447
As far as I can tell,
every officer on this list

559
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,573
served under Leyton
at one time or another.

560
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:18,744
And now they're all
in key positions here on Earth.

561
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,705
Or commanding ships
somewhere in this sector.

562
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:25,959
It says here, he's ordered
another set of transfers.

563
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,087
Take a look at these dates.

564
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,714
ODO:
They all take effect
on the 14th.

565
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:34,009
A day before
the president's speech.

566
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,303
Do you think
there's any connection?

567
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,637
(<i> sighs</i> )

568
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:40,140
Maybe Admiral Leyton
doesn't intend

569
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,768
for the president
to make his speech.

570
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,478
Hmm.

571
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,772
I better get
a copy of this.

572
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:51,651
Odo, if Admiral Leyton
is planning

573
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,695
some kind of takeover
on the 14th,

574
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,532
I want to make sure
that Jake and
my father are safe.

575
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:59,076
We should get them off Earth
as soon as possible.

576
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:00,494
(<i> door chimes</i> )

577
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,747
Come in.

578
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,250
Captain.

579
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,668
I'm surprised
to find you here.

580
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,504
Just cleaning out
some of my files.

581
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:13,299
I'll see you later,
Constable.

582
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,217
Good night, Captain.

583
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,764
I hear congratulations
are in order.

584
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,683
Your promotion--

585
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,311
Captain of the<i> Lakota.</i>

586
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:28,355
Thanks, but it's
still a few days away.

587
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,732
The<i> Lakota</i> won't be
done with its refit

588
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,192
until the 14th.

589
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,237
I guess that will make
the 14th a special day.

590
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:37,906
I'm looking
forward to it.

591
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,534
Too bad you won't be around
for the ceremony.

592
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:41,868
Oh, who knows?

593
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,954
I might be able
to fit it in.

594
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:47,500
I thought Admiral Leyton ordered
you back to Deep Space 9.

595
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,918
He did, but I've got
some leave coming,

596
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,962
and I've decided
to take it.

597
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:55,466
After all, I don't get
much time to spend on Earth

598
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:58,844
and it<i> is</i> so
pleasant here.

599
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:02,055
With a Starfleet officer
on every corner,

600
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:07,311
paradise has never
seemed so well armed.

601
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:10,648
You're a very
interesting man, Captain.

602
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:14,401
I'm sorry we didn't get
to work together longer.

603
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:25,412
Admiral. I didn't expect
to see you here.

604
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,665
I'm sure you didn't.

605
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:30,083
Captain,
your arm, please.

606
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,754
Do as she asks.

607
00:28:56,985 --> 00:29:00,322
Just as I said, Mr. President.

608
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,282
He's a shape-shifter.

609
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,966
You going to tell me how
you faked the blood test?

610
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:22,261
Does it matter?

611
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,597
I suppose not.

612
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:27,807
You know, Ben...

613
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,478
I stand here looking at you...

614
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:35,982
the best officer
who ever served under me...

615
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,112
trapped in this holding cell...

616
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,782
and I think...

617
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,994
life can be damn cruel.

618
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,871
Let me out.

619
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,708
Maybe life will look
a little better.

620
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,298
I don't think
I can do that just now.

621
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,467
So what<i> are</i> you
going to do?

622
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:04,219
Keep me here forever?

623
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,512
(<i> chuckling</i> )

624
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:08,557
You'll be free
to go in a few days.

625
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:10,183
Let me guess.

626
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,936
After the
president's speech.

627
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:18,817
The president won't
be making a speech.

628
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,068
I will.

629
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,070
I assume you'll
be explaining

630
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,406
to the public
why it's necessary

631
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:27,284
for Starfleet to
seize control of Earth.

632
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:29,202
Temporarily, of course--

633
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:33,666
until the changeling threat
has been neutralized.

634
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,875
And how long will that be?

635
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,503
Months? Years?

636
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:38,712
Decades?

637
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,839
However long it takes.

638
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:44,593
The people deserve
strong leadership--

639
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:47,387
someone who can protect them.

640
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,598
In other words...

641
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,099
you.

642
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,859
If you need anything...

643
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:04,780
food, something to read...

644
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,866
just tell the guards.

645
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,751
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

646
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:29,888
Well, if it isn't
my favorite vampire.

647
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,931
Vampires come out at night.

648
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,933
I've been pushing
this cart all day.

649
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,644
Look, I'm getting
a little tired

650
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,020
of all these
blood screenings.

651
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,105
Believe me, I'm as tired
of giving them

652
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,440
as you are
of taking them.

653
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,775
Why don't
you give me

654
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,652
one of those
while you're at it?

655
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:45,696
You don't really expect me
to let down that force field

656
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:47,781
and go in there
with you?

657
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:48,782
(<i> grunting</i> )

658
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:49,949
Sisko's not the one

659
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,452
you should be worried about--
I am.

660
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:55,205
Come here.

661
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,503
Nicely done,
Constable.

662
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:03,505
Well, it wasn't
that difficult, considering

663
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:06,132
I helped you revise the security
measures for this building.

664
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,427
Lucky for me.
Have you contacted Major Kira?

665
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:11,388
The<i> Defiant</i> is
on its way to Earth.

666
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:14,057
That must mean they found
what we were looking for.

667
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,851
Ah, it was just as you
suspected.

668
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,311
They even found
the officer responsible--

669
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,479
Lieutenant Arriaga.

670
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,565
They've put him on the<i> Defiant.</i>

671
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:23,191
You have to get
to the president.

672
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,485
Tell him everything
we know and warn him

673
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,446
that Leyton is going
to make his move

674
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:28,488
some time today.

675
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,073
What about you?

676
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,700
I've got some business
to take care of.

677
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,201
Right.

678
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,835
BENTEEN:
I understand the situation,
Admiral.

679
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:43,545
I'll do my best.

680
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,380
Good luck, Captain Benteen.

681
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,466
Leyton out.

682
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,723
Are you planning on using that?

683
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,809
Against a fellow officer?

684
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:58,644
I hope not.

685
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:01,229
But I<i> will</i> have to ask
for your resignation.

686
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,689
You'll forgive me

687
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,983
if I don't leap
at the opportunity.

688
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:08,069
I have enough evidence
to convict you of treason.

689
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,448
Do you?

690
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:13,909
We have Lieutenant
Arriaga in custody.

691
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,202
He is prepared to admit
that under your orders,

692
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,996
he attached a
subspace modulator

693
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,456
to the relay satellite

694
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,291
on the far side
of the wormhole.

695
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:24,586
That is why it was opening
and closing at random.

696
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,505
Why would anyone
want to do that?

697
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,214
To make it look like

698
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:31,217
a cloaked Dominion fleet
was entering Federation space,

699
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:34,304
so that when the Earth's
power relays were sabotaged

700
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:37,349
the people would think
that an invasion was imminent.

701
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,434
(<i> laughing</i> )

702
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,645
That's a very
interesting theory,

703
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:44,272
but it's not going
to do you much good.

704
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:47,526
Lieutenant Arriaga
isn't going to get to Earth.

705
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:50,821
I've sent the<i> Lakota</i>
to intercept the<i> Defiant.</i>

706
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:52,990
You think that one
Starfleet ship

707
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:55,492
is going to fire on another?

708
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:58,996
As far as Captain Benteen's crew
is concerned,

709
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:01,707
the<i> Defiant</i> isn't
a Starfleet ship.

710
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:04,877
They've been told
everyone on the<i> Defiant</i>

711
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:07,420
has been replaced
by shape-shifters.

712
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,304
DAX:
Commander, we're being hailed
by the<i> Lakota.</i>

713
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:19,349
They're ordering us
to drop out of warp
and prepare to be boarded.

714
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:21,309
They raised their shields
and powered up their phasers.

715
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,811
Looks like they won't
take no for an answer.

716
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,445
Admiral, do you realize
what's going on here?

717
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,573
Even if you win,
even if you manage

718
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:37,242
to oust Jaresh-Inyo,
you still lose.

719
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:39,036
We<i> all</i> lose.

720
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,875
I can't say I agree with you.

721
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:47,126
Do you think other
Federation worlds

722
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,046
are going to sit back
and let their president

723
00:34:49,046 --> 00:34:51,548
be replaced
by a military dictatorship?

724
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:53,383
Hardly a dictatorship, Ben.

725
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:54,885
(<i> sighs</i> )

726
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:58,805
Overthrowing
a legitimately elected president

727
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:02,976
and giving Starfleet direct
control over the government?

728
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:05,687
It sounds
like a dictatorship to me.

729
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:08,314
And I'm sure I'm not
the only one who thinks so.

730
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,861
There will be some dissenters
at first.

731
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,487
But they'll fall in line

732
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,281
once they realize
that strengthening Earth

733
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:19,409
is the first step toward
strengthening the Federation.

734
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:22,203
And what if they don't agree?
What then?

735
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,957
Are you willing
to risk a civil war?

736
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:26,875
If the<i> Lakota</i> fires
on the<i> Defiant</i>

737
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,086
you will be opening up
a Pandora's box

738
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:31,170
that may never be closed.

739
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:35,050
Then contact the<i> Defiant</i>
and tell them to stand down.

740
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:39,554
I won't do that.

741
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,725
I didn't think so.

742
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:46,061
But don't kid yourself, Ben.

743
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:49,773
This Pandora's box of yours...

744
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:52,275
we're opening it together.

745
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:05,497
The<i> Lakota's</i> targeting
their weapons
on our warp engines.

746
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,206
They're bluffing.
That's a Federation ship.

747
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,834
They're not going
to fire on us.

748
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,585
I hope you're right
about that, Chief.

749
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,837
Continue on course.

750
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:14,506
We're in weapons range.

751
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:15,966
Raise shields.

752
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,890
(<i> loud crashing</i> )

753
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,811
Damage report.

754
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,813
Port shields are at 60 percent.

755
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:32,149
Someone's been upgrading
the<i> Lakota's</i> weapons.

756
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:34,734
That's a lot of fire power
for an Excelsior-class ship.

757
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,653
Can we cloak?

758
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,196
We would have to lower shields.

759
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,991
I wouldn't
advise it.

760
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:43,535
Do we make a run for it?

761
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,203
If they've been tinkering
with the weapons

762
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,788
who knows what they've done
to the warp drive.

763
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:47,914
Hail them.

764
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,711
No answer.
(<i> yells</i> )

765
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:53,879
KIRA:
They're trying

766
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,463
to disable
our engines.

767
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,090
Let's go.

768
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,967
We've got to get you
to the medical bay.

769
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,179
What do we do,
Commander?

770
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,850
We fight.

771
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,269
Target their weapons.

772
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,897
Fire phasers.

773
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:27,954
Want some?

774
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,289
It's Bolian tonic water--
calms the nerves.

775
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,416
No, thank you.

776
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,845
Ironic, isn't it?

777
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,889
When you came on board
the<i> Okinawa,</i>

778
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,849
you were more interested

779
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:51,103
in engineering and ship design
than command.

780
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:53,855
But I promoted you
to lieutenant commander.

781
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:56,524
Gave you the post
of executive officer

782
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:59,485
and taught you everything I knew
about being a leader.

783
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,529
You were a good teacher.

784
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,199
Mm-hmm.

785
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:08,369
I only wish I'd taught you more
about the importance of loyalty.

786
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,875
You want to talk to<i> me</i>
about loyalty?

787
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:17,003
After you broke your oath
with the Federation,

788
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,714
lied to the people of Earth?

789
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,800
Ordered one of
our own starships

790
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,885
to fire on another!

791
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:27,889
You don't have the right.

792
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,892
You don't understand me
at all, do you?

793
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:32,936
I used to think I did.

794
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:35,563
I used to think that you
were a man of principles,

795
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,482
a man of honor.

796
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,442
I see that I was mistaken.

797
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:42,154
I'm sorry you feel that way.

798
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:45,323
So am I.

799
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:49,661
COM:
Admiral, we're receiving
a message from the<i> Lakota.</i>

800
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:52,914
Put it through.

801
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:54,958
We've been unable to stop
the<i> Defiant.</i>

802
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:57,919
Someone has equipped her
with ablative armor

803
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:01,006
and neglected to inform
Starfleet Operations.

804
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:03,800
Under no circumstances is
that ship to reach Earth.

805
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,511
The<i> Lakota's</i> carrying
quantum torpedoes, isn't she?

806
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:07,637
Yes, sir.

807
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,055
Then use them.

808
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,850
Admiral...

809
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,977
my orders were to disable
the<i> Defiant,</i>

810
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,270
not destroy her.

811
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,563
Your orders are to
keep the<i> Defiant</i>

812
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:20,066
from reaching Earth by any means
necessary, is that understood?

813
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:22,610
Yes, it is.

814
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,362
Captain, you know
as well as I do

815
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,323
that there aren't any
shape-shifters on the<i> Defiant.</i>

816
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:28,158
Use those quantum torpedoes,

817
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:31,536
and you will be killing
50 Starfleet officers.

818
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,788
Captain Benteen knows
where her duty lies.

819
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,124
You have your orders.

820
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,959
Yes, sir.

821
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,714
Shields are almost gone.

822
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,632
We have major systems failures
on decks 1, 3 and 4.

823
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,842
What about the<i> Lakota?</i>

824
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:47,260
KIRA:
They're in
worse shape.

825
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,137
One good hit
will probably finish them.

826
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,347
And kill everyone on board.

827
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:51,806
That is not an option.

828
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,432
It's either them or us.

829
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:54,934
(<i> console beeping</i> )

830
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,728
Mr. Worf, I think
you should look at this.

831
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,317
They have powered down
their weapons.

832
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,236
Hold your fire.

833
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:06,612
Commander!
They're hailing us.

834
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:10,950
On screen.

835
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,911
COM:
Admiral Leyton,
we are receiving a message

836
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:15,163
for Captain Sisko
from the<i> Defiant.</i>

837
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:17,540
Put him through.

838
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:20,418
Do as he says.

839
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,087
Patching it in, sir.

840
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:26,674
I apologize for the delay,
Captain.

841
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,509
What's your status,
Mr. Worf?

842
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,636
The<i> Lakota</i> has powered
down its weapons

843
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,555
and is allowing us
to proceed to Earth.

844
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,182
Casualties?

845
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:36,393
Bartlett and Ramsey
are dead, sir.

846
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:38,228
Seven others seriously injured.

847
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:41,356
Captain Benteen thinks there
may be as many as 24 casualties

848
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:42,607
on the<i> Lakota.</i>

849
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,442
Get here as soon as you can.

850
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,194
The president's expecting you.

851
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:47,987
Aye, sir.

852
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,160
That was a mistake, Ben--

853
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,037
talking to your ship
from my office.

854
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,373
Now that security
knows you're here,

855
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,333
you'll never make it
past that door.

856
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,252
It doesn't matter

857
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:03,962
whether I get out
of here or not.

858
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:08,174
By now, Odo is talking
to Jaresh-Inyo.

859
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:11,719
The president will have
all the evidence he needs

860
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,805
to stop you.
It's over.

861
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,890
It's not over!

862
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,605
I have enough loyal officers
to make a fight of it.

863
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,940
Who will you fight?

864
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,484
Starfleet?
The Federation?

865
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,195
Don't you see, Admiral?

866
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,530
You're fighting the wrong war.

867
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,244
And as for
your loyal officers,

868
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:38,704
Benteen's
already abandoned you.

869
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:41,374
And she was closer
to you than anyone.

870
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:43,501
You've lost.

871
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:47,046
Don't make anyone else
pay for your mistakes.

872
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:10,195
I hope...

873
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:12,905
you're not the one
making the mistake.

874
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,647
The streets are going to
seem emptier with them gone.

875
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,816
Would you be happier
if they'd stayed?

876
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,235
Oh, if they'd stayed,

877
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:53,196
it wouldn't be Earth
anymore, would it?

878
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:57,283
It didn't seem right--
all those phasers everywhere.

879
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,496
Something wrong, Odo?

880
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:03,706
Am I the only one who's worried

881
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,958
that there are still
changelings here on Earth?

882
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,626
Worried?

883
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:10,004
I'm scared to death,
but I'll be damned

884
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,839
if I'm going to let them change
the way I live my life.

885
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,632
SISKO:
If the changelings

886
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,134
want to destroy
what we've built here

887
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,635
they're going to have
to do it themselves.

888
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:18,971
We will not do it for them.

889
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:22,434
I'm going to miss you, son.

890
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,481
You too, Jake-o.

891
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,776
Feels like you just got here.

892
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,986
You sure
we can't convince you

893
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,405
to come back
to the station with us?

894
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:36,864
A Creole restaurant
would be a big hit

895
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,157
on the Promenade.

896
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,410
Then you'll just have
to open one.

897
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:42,370
This is my home.

898
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:45,706
Well, we'd better get going.

899
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,666
Now, don't forget...

900
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,377
Take my medicine.
I know.

901
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:51,546
Is he always such a mother hen?

902
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:52,964
He means well.

903
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,510
Take care of yourselves.

904
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:58,928
I'll do my best.

905
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:00,846
That's all I can ask.

906
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,850
Three to beam up.

907
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,654
Well, what are you
waiting for?

908
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,406
Come in. Have a seat.

909
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:20,699
Today I'm recommending
the pasta boudin.

910
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:23,953
It's got a bit of a kick,
but it will make you smile.
