1
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:05,668
Last time on
<i>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...</i>

2
00:00:05,703 --> 00:00:08,266
It'll be good to have
you home again, Benjamin.

3
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:12,715
Dad, you know that this
isn't exactly a vacation.

4
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:14,983
I'll be spending most of my time
in San Francisco

5
00:00:15,022 --> 00:00:16,183
at Starfleet Headquarters.

6
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:19,559
Ben, Earth is in danger.

7
00:00:19,598 --> 00:00:22,593
Something has to be done
about these shape-shifters.

8
00:00:22,637 --> 00:00:25,438
You know more about the Dominion
than anyone in Starfleet.

9
00:00:25,475 --> 00:00:29,108
And so, effective immediately,
I'm making you acting head

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,052
of Starfleet Security
here on Earth.

11
00:00:34,828 --> 00:00:36,855
Forgive the intrusion,
Mr. President

12
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,596
but as you can see, Starfleet

13
00:00:38,636 --> 00:00:40,104
has every right
to be concerned.

14
00:00:40,138 --> 00:00:42,005
If Odo was
a Dominion infiltrator

15
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,909
he could've killed you.

16
00:00:43,946 --> 00:00:46,713
You actually thought I was
one of them, didn't you?

17
00:00:46,752 --> 00:00:49,918
I don't know.
I wasn't sure.

18
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:52,623
This business has got you
so twisted around

19
00:00:52,664 --> 00:00:54,600
you, you can't think straight.

20
00:00:54,634 --> 00:00:55,761
A changeling infiltrated

21
00:00:55,803 --> 00:00:57,397
the grounds
of Starfleet Headquarters

22
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:59,602
imitated the Admiral,
and got away scot-free.

23
00:00:59,644 --> 00:01:01,443
Our security measures
aren't working.

24
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:04,385
We're doing everything
the President will let us do.

25
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,413
Maybe that's not enough.

26
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:08,154
Earth's entire
power relay system's

27
00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:09,993
been knocked off line.

28
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:12,730
In other words,
Earth is defenseless.

29
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:15,572
What you're asking me to do
is declare martial law.

30
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,411
What I'm asking you to do
is let us defend this planet.

31
00:01:18,448 --> 00:01:19,882
You'd better come
take a look at this.

32
00:01:19,918 --> 00:01:21,409
Take a look at what?

33
00:01:21,454 --> 00:01:22,444
Come on.

34
00:01:28,468 --> 00:01:30,631
And now, the conclusion.

35
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:37,810
I don't like this.

36
00:01:37,854 --> 00:01:39,847
The more I read
Starfleet's reports

37
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,918
on the sabotage
of the power relays

38
00:01:41,962 --> 00:01:44,091
the more unanswered
questions I have.

39
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:46,603
How were the changelings
able to infiltrate

40
00:01:46,638 --> 00:01:48,767
the Division
of Planetary Operations?

41
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:50,403
Where did they get the codes

42
00:01:50,445 --> 00:01:53,008
for the division's
computer control network?

43
00:01:53,051 --> 00:01:55,317
And how did
they manage to disable

44
00:01:55,422 --> 00:01:58,451
every power relay on Earth
at the same time?

45
00:01:58,495 --> 00:02:02,936
Captain, have you ever heard
of a group called Red Squad?

46
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:05,168
They're an elite team
of Starfleet cadets.

47
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,576
According to Nog,
every student at the Academy

48
00:02:07,613 --> 00:02:08,911
wants to be a part of it.

49
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:10,212
Oh.

50
00:02:10,252 --> 00:02:11,915
Well, that explains it.

51
00:02:11,955 --> 00:02:13,925
Explains what?

52
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,259
Well, according
to this transporter log

53
00:02:16,297 --> 00:02:18,665
a group called "Red Squad"
was beamed back

54
00:02:18,702 --> 00:02:20,968
to Starfleet Academy,
26 minutes

55
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:24,070
after the state of emergency
was declared.

56
00:02:24,113 --> 00:02:25,308
That's strange.

57
00:02:25,382 --> 00:02:28,479
During the blackout, Starfleet
mobilized hundreds of units.

58
00:02:28,521 --> 00:02:30,184
Why would they
demobilize Red Squad?

59
00:02:30,225 --> 00:02:31,318
That's why I brought it up.

60
00:02:31,394 --> 00:02:34,298
But if they're cadets,
I suppose Starfleet

61
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,166
wanted to get them
out of harm's way.

62
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:41,539
If that's true,
how do you explain this?

63
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:44,553
Three hours later, Starfleet
Command issued an order

64
00:02:44,587 --> 00:02:47,753
assigning the entire corps
of cadets to field duty.

65
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:51,564
Which means they weren't
bringing Red Squad home

66
00:02:51,601 --> 00:02:53,264
for their protection.

67
00:02:53,304 --> 00:02:54,704
So the question is

68
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,041
why would they
demobilize Red Squad

69
00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:00,313
only to mobilize them
again three hours later?

70
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:05,320
Lights.

71
00:03:05,428 --> 00:03:08,025
Are you sure reopening
the restaurant is a good idea?

72
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:10,664
Jake, it's been four days
since the power outage.

73
00:03:10,706 --> 00:03:15,113
Have you seen
any Dominion invasion fleet?

74
00:03:15,148 --> 00:03:16,981
No.

75
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:18,282
Neither have I.

76
00:03:18,321 --> 00:03:19,721
Besides, at my age

77
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:23,162
I don't have time to waste
sitting at home being bored.

78
00:03:23,197 --> 00:03:25,030
You know, there's hardly anyone
on the streets.

79
00:03:25,068 --> 00:03:26,867
You're not going
to have any customers.

80
00:03:26,905 --> 00:03:28,738
Oh, I've got plenty
of customers.

81
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:29,801
Just look outside.

82
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:41,199
All I see are security officers.

83
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:42,896
And I bet not one of them

84
00:03:42,937 --> 00:03:45,169
has had a good meal
in four days.

85
00:03:46,845 --> 00:03:48,940
Now, you do your grandfather
a favor

86
00:03:48,982 --> 00:03:51,248
and start chopping up the okra.

87
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:57,057
Captain Sisko, is there
something I can do for you?

88
00:03:57,099 --> 00:03:59,592
I need to talk to you
about Red Squad.

89
00:03:59,636 --> 00:04:01,230
Go on.

90
00:04:01,273 --> 00:04:03,904
Are you aware there's
a transporter record

91
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:05,643
of Red Squad being returned

92
00:04:05,682 --> 00:04:08,279
to the Academy
not long after the power outage?

93
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:11,816
Are you saying that's
in the official records?

94
00:04:11,862 --> 00:04:13,194
That's right.

95
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:15,258
Is this a secure line?

96
00:04:15,301 --> 00:04:16,861
It is at my end.

97
00:04:16,905 --> 00:04:18,499
One moment.

98
00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:23,308
Sorry, Captain, but I think

99
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:26,187
you'll agree that this is
a time for caution.

100
00:04:26,223 --> 00:04:27,384
Absolutely.

101
00:04:27,425 --> 00:04:29,793
Does Admiral Leyton
know about this report?

102
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:31,425
He hasn't mentioned it to me.

103
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:33,403
Listen to me, Captain.

104
00:04:33,437 --> 00:04:35,669
I want that record erased

105
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,371
before anyone else can see it.

106
00:04:37,412 --> 00:04:38,437
Is that understood?

107
00:04:38,514 --> 00:04:41,213
I'll take care of it
immediately.

108
00:04:41,253 --> 00:04:43,723
Good. That report
could cause us a lot of trouble.

109
00:04:43,758 --> 00:04:45,192
I'm glad you spotted it.

110
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:46,196
So am I.

111
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,200
I'd hate to see
the members of Red Squad

112
00:04:48,234 --> 00:04:49,259
get into any trouble.

113
00:04:49,303 --> 00:04:50,932
They're fine
young men and women.

114
00:04:50,973 --> 00:04:54,309
When Leyton talked to me
about using them

115
00:04:54,346 --> 00:04:55,872
I thought it was a mistake

116
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:59,013
but I must admit, they performed
their mission admirably.

117
00:04:59,056 --> 00:05:01,687
I appreciate your call, Captain.

118
00:05:01,727 --> 00:05:03,663
I'm in your debt.

119
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,433
Well...

120
00:05:10,545 --> 00:05:15,783
that certainly raised more
questions than it answered.

121
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:20,235
What did I tell you?

122
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:22,605
As human as I ever was.

123
00:07:29,122 --> 00:07:31,524
You seem pretty jovial today.

124
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,327
Well, is there
a problem with that?

125
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:36,598
It's just...

126
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,400
Well, you didn't seem too happy

127
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,958
about being tested
a few days ago.

128
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:42,391
Well, that was before
the changelings

129
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:44,058
sabotaged the power grid.

130
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:45,499
I know, but you have to admit

131
00:07:45,535 --> 00:07:47,095
you were
pretty adamant about it.

132
00:07:47,205 --> 00:07:49,573
I don't understand you.

133
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,912
When I didn't want to be tested,
you made it an issue.

134
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:56,719
Now that I'm cooperating,
you're still not satisfied.

135
00:07:56,757 --> 00:07:59,125
It's not you, Dad.

136
00:07:59,196 --> 00:08:00,927
Then what is it?

137
00:08:00,965 --> 00:08:03,026
I'm not sure.

138
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,064
Maybe I'm just being paranoid.

139
00:08:05,108 --> 00:08:07,340
Uh, Captain, Jake said
you wanted to see me.

140
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:10,078
Yes, I do.

141
00:08:10,118 --> 00:08:11,347
Uh, you two talk.

142
00:08:11,387 --> 00:08:13,687
I'll go chill some tube grubs.

143
00:08:17,532 --> 00:08:19,058
What can I do for you, sir?

144
00:08:19,103 --> 00:08:20,697
It's about Red Squad.

145
00:08:20,738 --> 00:08:22,765
Red Squad?
Did you get me in?

146
00:08:22,809 --> 00:08:23,834
Not just yet.

147
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,314
Oh, too bad.
Those guys are the best.

148
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,750
They're the only people I know

149
00:08:27,786 --> 00:08:29,619
who aren't afraid
of the Dominion.

150
00:08:29,656 --> 00:08:31,285
Why is that?

151
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:34,094
I don't know.

152
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:36,262
They're not scared
of anything, I guess.

153
00:08:36,303 --> 00:08:38,102
You seem to know
them pretty well.

154
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:41,545
Jake told me I should try
to get to know them better...

155
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,482
show them that I'm a good guy.

156
00:08:43,518 --> 00:08:45,784
And so far,
it seems to be working.

157
00:08:45,822 --> 00:08:47,849
The truth is, I think
they only like me

158
00:08:47,893 --> 00:08:48,918
because I know you.

159
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:50,156
Is that so?

160
00:08:50,265 --> 00:08:52,930
You're kind of their hero...
the man at the front line

161
00:08:52,969 --> 00:08:54,460
in the war with the Dominion.

162
00:08:54,506 --> 00:08:56,874
I'd like to meet
some of these cadets.

163
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,974
You think you could
introduce me to one of them?

164
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:02,078
I'm sorry.
I can't do that, sir.

165
00:09:02,122 --> 00:09:05,823
The names of Red Squad members
are supposed to be secret.

166
00:09:05,862 --> 00:09:07,330
But you know who they are.

167
00:09:07,365 --> 00:09:10,860
It's not easy keeping
secrets from a Ferengi.

168
00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:13,239
But I feel funny
telling anyone else.

169
00:09:13,277 --> 00:09:16,044
Besides, if they found out
I told you who they were

170
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,278
I'd never get in.

171
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:20,348
Cadet, you are obviously
under the mistaken impression

172
00:09:20,391 --> 00:09:21,825
that I am asking a favor.

173
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,832
I want a name, and I want it
now, and that is an order.

174
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:26,300
Understood, Mr. Nog?

175
00:09:26,337 --> 00:09:28,865
Yes, sir.

176
00:09:32,215 --> 00:09:34,846
Cadet Shepard reporting
as ordered, Captain.

177
00:09:34,886 --> 00:09:36,617
Riley Aldrin Shepard...

178
00:09:36,657 --> 00:09:41,656
Starfleet service
number C953O4699427

179
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,863
a third-year student
at Starfleet Academy

180
00:09:43,904 --> 00:09:45,771
with a specialty
in tactical operations.

181
00:09:45,808 --> 00:09:47,675
Yes, sir.

182
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,912
Cadet, I have been
reviewing a record

183
00:09:50,952 --> 00:09:53,515
of Red Squad activities
on the night of the 23rd...

184
00:09:53,557 --> 00:09:55,220
the night of the power outage.

185
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,229
Record, sir?
We were told

186
00:09:56,297 --> 00:09:58,199
there was not going to be
any written record.

187
00:09:58,234 --> 00:09:59,760
Are you contradicting me, Cadet?

188
00:09:59,803 --> 00:10:01,237
No, sir.

189
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,833
Good. Now who told you there
wasn't to be a written record?

190
00:10:03,878 --> 00:10:05,609
The briefing officer, sir.

191
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:07,379
I want that officer's name.

192
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:08,751
She didn't give us her name, sir

193
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:11,088
but she did say there would be
no record of our actions

194
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:13,096
and that our role would
have to go unrecognized

195
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,257
at least for now.

196
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:17,429
Maybe if you'd done your
job better, it would have.

197
00:10:17,472 --> 00:10:19,442
But you fouled it up,
didn't you?

198
00:10:19,476 --> 00:10:21,469
You cadets did
some sloppy work...

199
00:10:21,513 --> 00:10:23,415
some damn sloppy work.

200
00:10:23,451 --> 00:10:25,250
With all due respect, sir...
that's not true, sir.

201
00:10:25,288 --> 00:10:26,848
The mission went perfectly.

202
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,487
If anything, it was easier
than the simulations.

203
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,522
Now, son, if you think
by lying to me

204
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:34,539
you're going to save your own
hide, you'd better forget it.

205
00:10:34,573 --> 00:10:37,807
Mistakes were made, and I will
find out who's responsible.

206
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,214
I'm not lying to you, sir.

207
00:10:40,251 --> 00:10:41,583
I was there.

208
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,613
I was at Planetary
Operations the whole time.

209
00:10:43,657 --> 00:10:46,127
If anything had gone wrong,
I would have known about it.

210
00:10:46,163 --> 00:10:47,826
Is that so?

211
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:51,567
All right, Cadet,
let's go over this step by step

212
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:54,602
from the time
of your mission deployment

213
00:10:54,646 --> 00:10:57,675
to your return to base
at 1947 hours PST

214
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:59,780
on the night of the 23rd.

215
00:10:59,823 --> 00:11:01,223
Yes, sir.

216
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,457
We assembled on the eastern quad

217
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:06,298
at 1700 hours
on the evening of the 23rd.

218
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,636
I assume by "we,"
you mean Red Squad.

219
00:11:08,674 --> 00:11:13,047
Yes, sir. After assembly, we
were beamed aboard the <i>Lakota.</i>

220
00:11:13,082 --> 00:11:14,881
Once aboard,
we received our equipment

221
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,081
and the necessary codes

222
00:11:16,122 --> 00:11:17,181
and were
transported directly

223
00:11:17,225 --> 00:11:19,161
to the Division of Planetary
Operations in Lisbon.

224
00:11:19,196 --> 00:11:20,425
At what time?

225
00:11:20,465 --> 00:11:23,733
0400 hours, exactly...
local time, of course.

226
00:11:23,771 --> 00:11:26,173
Go on, Cadet.

227
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,941
Our contact inside the DPO

228
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,245
gave us access to their
computer control network.

229
00:11:30,284 --> 00:11:32,949
From there, we used the access
codes we were given

230
00:11:32,989 --> 00:11:34,754
bypassed
the security lockouts

231
00:11:34,793 --> 00:11:36,524
and downloaded the
disordering protocols

232
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,533
into the network.

233
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:40,696
And from there,
the protocols spread

234
00:11:40,738 --> 00:11:43,231
to every power relay
on the planet.

235
00:11:43,277 --> 00:11:45,247
It was a pretty
impressive sight, sir

236
00:11:45,281 --> 00:11:47,912
watching those relays wink out
one after another.

237
00:11:47,952 --> 00:11:49,546
Sorry I missed it.

238
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:52,686
After that, all we had to do was

239
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:55,599
sabotage the restart sequencers
and get out.

240
00:11:55,635 --> 00:11:58,664
Like I said, sir,
it was all by the numbers.

241
00:11:58,707 --> 00:12:03,080
And are you sure that this cadet
is telling the truth?

242
00:12:03,116 --> 00:12:05,713
He admitted to committing
acts of treason

243
00:12:05,755 --> 00:12:07,223
against the Federation.

244
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:08,921
If he was going to lie

245
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,694
I think he would have
made up a better story.

246
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:14,226
I take it that you gave
him a blood screening.

247
00:12:14,272 --> 00:12:15,706
I tested him myself.

248
00:12:15,741 --> 00:12:17,711
He's human.

249
00:12:17,745 --> 00:12:20,979
Well, then let's say
he is telling the truth...

250
00:12:21,018 --> 00:12:24,047
that his superior
officers ordered him

251
00:12:24,091 --> 00:12:26,391
to sabotage the power relays.

252
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:31,234
That still doesn't rule
out Dominion involvement.

253
00:12:31,273 --> 00:12:33,833
For all we know, his superiors

254
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:36,026
have been replaced
by changelings.

255
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:37,766
I thought about that.

256
00:12:39,777 --> 00:12:43,342
But if it were changelings,
what have they accomplished?

257
00:12:43,385 --> 00:12:46,551
There's been no invasion
and power's been restored.

258
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:48,618
And Starfleet has
fortified Earth.

259
00:12:48,662 --> 00:12:50,291
I see your point, Captain.

260
00:12:50,332 --> 00:12:53,065
So, let's say you're right.

261
00:12:53,137 --> 00:12:58,205
Starfleet officers have
sabotaged the power grid.

262
00:12:58,247 --> 00:13:00,217
What are you going
to do about it?

263
00:13:02,923 --> 00:13:05,656
That is the bottom line,
isn't it?

264
00:13:05,696 --> 00:13:09,157
What am I going to do?

265
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:14,541
These aren't evil people, Odo.

266
00:13:16,116 --> 00:13:18,382
These are people I worked with.

267
00:13:18,421 --> 00:13:20,823
They're my friends...

268
00:13:20,859 --> 00:13:23,558
people I respect.

269
00:13:23,598 --> 00:13:27,333
How can I turn against them?

270
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:29,400
It seems to me...

271
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:33,213
if they have committed treason
against the Federation...

272
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,847
the Federation
that you swore to protect...

273
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:38,291
you won't be turning
against them.

274
00:13:38,328 --> 00:13:41,300
They will have turned
against you.

275
00:13:48,548 --> 00:13:52,852
Captain, I've been
in politics for 70 years.

276
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,691
I'm no stranger to overstatement
and exaggeration

277
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:57,220
but the idea that Starfleet

278
00:13:57,265 --> 00:14:00,066
would plot to overthrow
the Federation government

279
00:14:00,104 --> 00:14:03,565
is the single most astonishing
accusation I have ever heard.

280
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:05,843
Sir, if you'll hear us out...

281
00:14:05,882 --> 00:14:07,316
As I intend to

282
00:14:07,352 --> 00:14:11,087
but you'll forgive me
if I remain somewhat skeptical.

283
00:14:11,126 --> 00:14:14,793
Now, you should start
at the beginning.

284
00:14:15,936 --> 00:14:17,599
Several months ago, I learned

285
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,973
from one of my people,
that changelings

286
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,843
had infiltrated the Federation.

287
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:24,113
Not long after I gave
this information

288
00:14:24,152 --> 00:14:25,917
to Starfleet, reports indicate

289
00:14:25,956 --> 00:14:28,085
that Admiral Leyton
led a contingent

290
00:14:28,127 --> 00:14:30,597
of high-ranking officers
to meet with you

291
00:14:30,632 --> 00:14:32,727
and recommend implementation

292
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:35,707
of sweeping security measures
meant to protect Earth.

293
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:38,339
And I rejected their suggestions
as extreme.

294
00:14:38,381 --> 00:14:39,975
It's no secret that Leyton

295
00:14:40,017 --> 00:14:42,921
disagreed with you,
and despite your calls for calm

296
00:14:42,956 --> 00:14:46,156
his concern about the Dominion
threat continued to grow.

297
00:14:46,229 --> 00:14:47,755
When the Antwerp Conference

298
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,735
was bombed,
Leyton became convinced

299
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,799
that the changelings posed
a greater threat to Earth

300
00:14:52,843 --> 00:14:54,779
than you were prepared to admit.

301
00:14:54,813 --> 00:14:58,149
And so Admiral Leyton
approached me again

302
00:14:58,187 --> 00:15:00,988
this time
with you two at his side

303
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:03,657
and I agreed to his proposals.

304
00:15:03,698 --> 00:15:04,961
To some of his proposals.

305
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,366
We believe that Admiral Leyton

306
00:15:06,403 --> 00:15:08,339
and his supporters
weren't satisfied

307
00:15:08,373 --> 00:15:11,345
with the limited security
procedures you authorized.

308
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:13,713
They were convinced that
extraordinary measures

309
00:15:13,751 --> 00:15:16,244
were needed to counter
the changeling threat.

310
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:17,484
More than that,
they were determined

311
00:15:17,526 --> 00:15:19,621
to prove to you
and to everyone else

312
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:22,897
how vulnerable Earth was
to a Dominion takeover.

313
00:15:22,936 --> 00:15:25,338
So they sabotaged
the global power grid...

314
00:15:25,374 --> 00:15:28,540
Starfleet officers
committing sabotage?!

315
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:31,348
I know exactly how you feel,
but it's the truth.

316
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:36,352
I find that
difficult to believe.

317
00:15:36,396 --> 00:15:38,764
Admiral Leyton
may be somewhat grating

318
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:40,201
and inflexible at times

319
00:15:40,304 --> 00:15:43,174
but for a man
of his accomplishments

320
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,544
a man of his distinguished
record to commit treason?

321
00:15:45,582 --> 00:15:48,110
I'm sure the Admiral
doesn't see it as treason.

322
00:15:48,153 --> 00:15:51,718
He would probably defend it as
a desperate act of patriotism.

323
00:15:51,761 --> 00:15:53,127
He and his supporters think

324
00:15:53,163 --> 00:15:55,030
that their actions
are both necessary

325
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:56,035
and justified.

326
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:57,094
Not to mention effective.

327
00:15:57,138 --> 00:15:58,106
Think about it.

328
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,871
The power grid fails

329
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,073
and the next thing you know,
Starfleet security officers

330
00:16:02,114 --> 00:16:05,348
are on the streets of every
city, armed with phaser rifles

331
00:16:05,387 --> 00:16:07,482
blood testing citizens
at random.

332
00:16:07,526 --> 00:16:10,293
Your story has a certain logic
to it, gentlemen

333
00:16:10,331 --> 00:16:11,960
but what it lacks is proof.

334
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:13,367
You want proof?

335
00:16:13,403 --> 00:16:16,807
Order Admiral Leyton to withdraw
his troops from the streets.

336
00:16:16,844 --> 00:16:18,005
See what he does.

337
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:20,482
You think he would refuse
a direct order

338
00:16:20,518 --> 00:16:22,112
from his Commander in Chief?

339
00:16:22,154 --> 00:16:24,056
If he orders his troops
to stand down

340
00:16:24,092 --> 00:16:27,553
then I'm wrong,
and I'll offer my resignation

341
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:29,728
but I don't think
that's going to happen.

342
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:33,231
With those troops in place,
Admiral Leyton controls Earth

343
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,246
and he's not going
to give up that control

344
00:16:35,347 --> 00:16:38,878
until he's convinced that he
has ended the Dominion threat.

345
00:16:38,921 --> 00:16:41,221
He may not have
to give up anything.

346
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:42,727
If what you say is true...

347
00:16:42,763 --> 00:16:45,564
if the power outage
was part of Leyton's plan...

348
00:16:45,602 --> 00:16:47,231
then it's worked perfectly.

349
00:16:47,271 --> 00:16:49,468
Right now, the public
overwhelmingly

350
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,480
supports the increased security.

351
00:16:51,514 --> 00:16:54,452
If I try to remove those troops
over Leyton's objection

352
00:16:54,485 --> 00:16:57,013
I'll have a planetwide
riot on my hands.

353
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:00,154
What if we bring you the proof?

354
00:17:00,197 --> 00:17:02,599
Hard evidence linking Leyton

355
00:17:02,636 --> 00:17:03,831
to the sabotage
of the power grid?

356
00:17:03,871 --> 00:17:06,468
With that,
you could force Leyton

357
00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:09,140
to stand down,
make him withdraw the troops.

358
00:17:09,182 --> 00:17:13,783
If what you say is true,
I'll have his resignation.

359
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:17,959
Bring me the evidence,
I promise I'll use it.

360
00:17:19,035 --> 00:17:20,264
Sorry I'm late.

361
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,736
Where's Cadet Shepard?

362
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,174
That's a good question.

363
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,678
I couldn't find him anywhere.

364
00:17:24,713 --> 00:17:26,876
What do you mean
you couldn't find him?

365
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:28,283
I mean, he's gone.

366
00:17:28,353 --> 00:17:31,018
As far as I can tell, so is
every other member of Red Squad.

367
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:33,086
Uh, the rumor is
they've all been sent

368
00:17:33,129 --> 00:17:34,928
on some kind
of training exercise.

369
00:17:36,904 --> 00:17:38,498
I'm afraid Cadet Shepard

370
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,307
won't be returning to Earth
any time soon.

371
00:17:41,346 --> 00:17:42,780
Admiral Leyton, it's...

372
00:17:42,816 --> 00:17:44,877
Return to your quarters,
Cadet.

373
00:17:49,362 --> 00:17:51,491
Ben...

374
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:54,096
I think you and I
have to talk...

375
00:17:54,138 --> 00:17:56,199
in private.

376
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,476
I'll be in the next room
if you need me.

377
00:18:02,622 --> 00:18:04,854
Mind if I get a cup of coffee?

378
00:18:04,893 --> 00:18:06,361
Help yourself.

379
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:11,196
I haven't been getting
a lot of sleep lately.

380
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:12,730
Too much to do.

381
00:18:12,776 --> 00:18:15,008
Maybe you need a vacation.

382
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:22,557
Mmm.

383
00:18:22,595 --> 00:18:27,333
Somehow, replicated coffee
never tastes this good.

384
00:18:38,393 --> 00:18:40,761
I'm afraid I owe you
an apology, Ben.

385
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:41,959
The way I see it

386
00:18:42,001 --> 00:18:44,130
you owe a lot of people
an apology.

387
00:18:44,171 --> 00:18:47,541
I wish I could've told you
the truth from the beginning

388
00:18:47,578 --> 00:18:48,978
but somehow I suspected

389
00:18:49,015 --> 00:18:51,253
we wouldn't see eye to eye
on this thing.

390
00:18:51,386 --> 00:18:52,980
Then why did you bring me here?

391
00:18:53,023 --> 00:18:55,859
Because I needed someone
who knew how to fight

392
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:58,732
shape-shifters, and that's you.

393
00:18:58,768 --> 00:19:00,465
And I suppose on some level

394
00:19:00,504 --> 00:19:03,772
I hoped that when you saw
what we were accomplishing

395
00:19:03,812 --> 00:19:05,041
you'd join us.

396
00:19:05,147 --> 00:19:08,586
You've always had
a strong sense of duty.

397
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,421
My duty is to protect
the Federation.

398
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,057
That's what we're trying to do.

399
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:17,469
What you're trying to do
is to seize control of Earth

400
00:19:17,505 --> 00:19:19,634
and place it
under military rule.

401
00:19:19,677 --> 00:19:22,706
If that's what it takes
to stop the Dominion.

402
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,084
So you're willing
to destroy paradise

403
00:19:25,187 --> 00:19:26,553
in order to save it?

404
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,962
Remember when we were
on the <i>Okinawa</i>

405
00:19:32,001 --> 00:19:33,492
fighting the Tzenkethi?

406
00:19:33,537 --> 00:19:35,769
That time when I wanted
to take the ship

407
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:38,872
into an asteroid belt to chase
down those three raiders?

408
00:19:38,915 --> 00:19:41,078
And I said it was
an unnecessary risk.

409
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,348
You spoke your mind.

410
00:19:42,388 --> 00:19:45,451
Which is exactly
what a good executive officer

411
00:19:45,494 --> 00:19:47,054
is supposed to do.

412
00:19:47,098 --> 00:19:48,863
But I overruled you.

413
00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:53,802
After the staff meeting,
you followed me

414
00:19:53,845 --> 00:19:56,715
into my ready room
and tried to argue

415
00:19:56,751 --> 00:19:58,242
your point again.

416
00:19:58,287 --> 00:20:00,280
That's right, I did.

417
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,953
And remember what I told you?

418
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:07,563
That a good officer must respect
the chain of command.

419
00:20:07,605 --> 00:20:09,734
That there comes a time

420
00:20:09,777 --> 00:20:13,181
when you must accept the orders
of a superior officer

421
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,981
and carry out those orders

422
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,354
whether you agree with them
or not.

423
00:20:17,391 --> 00:20:20,022
I also told you
that when you became a CO

424
00:20:20,064 --> 00:20:21,555
you'd feel the same way.

425
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,433
And you were right...

426
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:27,672
about going after the Tzenkethi
and about me.

427
00:20:27,712 --> 00:20:29,978
Without the chain of command

428
00:20:30,017 --> 00:20:32,750
Starfleet would cease
to function

429
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:36,125
and we wouldn't stand a chance
against our enemies.

430
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:44,542
I'm still
your Commanding Officer

431
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:46,811
and now, more than ever

432
00:20:46,851 --> 00:20:49,618
I need you to respect
my authority.

433
00:20:49,656 --> 00:20:51,853
And I cannot do that!

434
00:20:51,894 --> 00:20:53,420
Not this time.

435
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:59,068
Then as of now, I'm relieving
you of your post

436
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:01,909
as temporary head
of Earth Security

437
00:21:01,948 --> 00:21:04,977
and sending you back
to Deep Space 9.

438
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,388
Go home, Ben.

439
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:11,729
You don't belong here.

440
00:21:17,378 --> 00:21:19,780
Beautiful evening, isn't it?

441
00:21:19,817 --> 00:21:22,117
Chief, how'd you get here?

442
00:21:22,154 --> 00:21:23,817
You don't look so good.

443
00:21:23,858 --> 00:21:26,386
You've a lot
on your mind, I bet.

444
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:27,955
How is your father?

445
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,563
There's no way the <i>Defiant</i>
could get here so soon.

446
00:21:30,604 --> 00:21:33,269
I didn't say I came
on the <i>Defiant.</i>

447
00:21:33,343 --> 00:21:34,937
Tell me the truth.

448
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,282
Do you really believe
that phaser rifles

449
00:21:38,353 --> 00:21:41,723
will do any good
against shape-shifters?

450
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,228
You're not O'Brien.

451
00:21:43,263 --> 00:21:44,561
Oh, luckily no.

452
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:46,159
The thought of being locked

453
00:21:46,202 --> 00:21:48,672
into one shape all the time,
it's, ooh...

454
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,506
it's unnatural.

455
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:52,707
Ah, don't bother
calling for help.

456
00:21:52,748 --> 00:21:55,048
It'll only cut short
our conversation

457
00:21:55,087 --> 00:21:56,852
and I do enjoy your company.

458
00:21:56,891 --> 00:22:00,022
If you have something
to say to me, say it.

459
00:22:00,064 --> 00:22:03,002
Oh, you solids,
you are so impatient.

460
00:22:03,036 --> 00:22:05,564
I-I thought we could
sit here for a while.

461
00:22:05,607 --> 00:22:08,738
Maybe go to a bar, have a pint,
throw some darts.

462
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,941
I don't think so.

463
00:22:09,983 --> 00:22:13,387
Let me ask you a question.

464
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,491
How many changelings do
you think are here on Earth

465
00:22:18,533 --> 00:22:19,899
right at this moment?

466
00:22:19,937 --> 00:22:23,068
I'm not going to play
any guessing games with you.

467
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,135
Ah.

468
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:26,080
What if I were to tell you

469
00:22:26,116 --> 00:22:30,318
that there are only four
on this entire planet?

470
00:22:30,424 --> 00:22:31,619
Huh?

471
00:22:31,659 --> 00:22:34,095
Not counting Constable Odo,
of course.

472
00:22:34,132 --> 00:22:35,259
Think of it.

473
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,236
Just four of us

474
00:22:37,271 --> 00:22:39,970
and look at the havoc
we've wrought.

475
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:43,210
How do I know
you're telling me the truth?

476
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,313
Oh, four is more than enough.

477
00:22:46,356 --> 00:22:48,155
We're smarter than solids.

478
00:22:48,193 --> 00:22:51,188
We're better than you,
and most importantly

479
00:22:51,232 --> 00:22:53,566
we do not fear you

480
00:22:53,603 --> 00:22:56,166
the way you fear us.

481
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:59,511
In the end, it's your fear
that will destroy you.

482
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:01,017
Are you finished?

483
00:23:01,052 --> 00:23:02,418
Finished?

484
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,662
We've barely begun.

485
00:23:06,696 --> 00:23:09,224
I'll be seeing you.

486
00:23:24,632 --> 00:23:26,932
I recognize that look.

487
00:23:26,971 --> 00:23:28,941
What look?

488
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:30,273
The one you're wearing...

489
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:33,009
the one that says,
"something's bothering me

490
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:35,383
and I don't know
what to do about it."

491
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,513
Oh. That look.

492
00:23:36,556 --> 00:23:39,255
Do you want to tell me about it?

493
00:23:39,295 --> 00:23:40,821
I wish I could.

494
00:23:40,864 --> 00:23:42,298
Oh, I see.

495
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:45,204
It's a Neffie Beumont-
kind of thing.

496
00:23:48,246 --> 00:23:50,716
Neffie Beumont... whoo!

497
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:52,846
What a crush I had on her.

498
00:23:52,888 --> 00:23:55,017
Not that you'd admit it.

499
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,087
You just sat around for weeks

500
00:23:57,131 --> 00:24:01,435
brooding and pining away,
trying to sort it all out

501
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:04,603
until your old man finally
sat you down one day

502
00:24:04,645 --> 00:24:06,581
and gave you some advice.

503
00:24:06,616 --> 00:24:09,179
"There comes a time
in every man's life

504
00:24:09,221 --> 00:24:12,216
when he must stop thinking
and start doing."

505
00:24:12,261 --> 00:24:14,994
And the next day,
you finally went over

506
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:17,401
to young Neffie's house
and asked her out.

507
00:24:17,504 --> 00:24:19,406
And she turned me down.

508
00:24:19,508 --> 00:24:22,412
But at least you weren't
brooding anymore.

509
00:24:22,448 --> 00:24:25,614
And when Zoey Phillips
moved into the neighborhood

510
00:24:25,654 --> 00:24:28,147
a few weeks later,
you asked her out

511
00:24:28,193 --> 00:24:31,324
before her parents were done
beaming in the furniture.

512
00:24:31,366 --> 00:24:33,700
And dated her for three years.

513
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:38,970
I guess
what you're telling me is

514
00:24:39,015 --> 00:24:41,851
that I must stop brooding
and make a decision.

515
00:24:41,886 --> 00:24:43,913
Exactly.

516
00:24:43,957 --> 00:24:45,645
Thank you, Dad.

517
00:24:45,778 --> 00:24:47,873
Don't mention it.

518
00:24:55,364 --> 00:24:57,664
Make sure you turn
out the lights

519
00:24:57,702 --> 00:24:59,729
on your way out.

520
00:25:02,011 --> 00:25:05,712
I wonder whatever happened
to Zoey Phillips?

521
00:25:11,563 --> 00:25:13,863
Zoey Phillips.

522
00:25:15,872 --> 00:25:17,501
Captain, why are you
transmitting

523
00:25:17,542 --> 00:25:18,737
on a Bajoran frequency?

524
00:25:18,778 --> 00:25:20,941
We have things
we need to discuss

525
00:25:20,982 --> 00:25:23,418
that I don't want
anyone else to hear.

526
00:25:23,454 --> 00:25:24,717
What's your status?

527
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:25,815
Everything here is fine.

528
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,794
There's been no sign
of Dominion activity.

529
00:25:27,829 --> 00:25:29,161
What about the wormhole?

530
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:30,828
It's acting normally again.

531
00:25:30,868 --> 00:25:32,861
It stopped opening
and closing at random

532
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,272
not long after you left.

533
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:35,709
If any Dominion ships
did sneak through

534
00:25:35,745 --> 00:25:36,974
they're not giving us
any trouble.

535
00:25:37,014 --> 00:25:38,175
Listen closely.

536
00:25:38,217 --> 00:25:41,018
There's something
I need for you to do.

537
00:25:47,769 --> 00:25:49,067
It's all yours.

538
00:25:49,105 --> 00:25:50,095
I suggest you hurry.

539
00:25:50,141 --> 00:25:51,770
I doubt
it'll take them very long

540
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,244
to discover that we're here.

541
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,339
I never knew it was so easy

542
00:25:54,382 --> 00:25:56,352
to break into classified
Starfleet files.

543
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,720
Everything I know
I learned from Quark.

544
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:00,750
Looks like Leyton's
been a busy man.

545
00:26:00,795 --> 00:26:02,822
He's personally reassigned
over 400 officers

546
00:26:02,866 --> 00:26:04,027
in the past three weeks.

547
00:26:04,069 --> 00:26:06,164
Do you recognize
any of these names?

548
00:26:06,206 --> 00:26:08,005
A lot of them.

549
00:26:08,042 --> 00:26:10,980
Daneeka, McWatt...
Snowden, Orr, Moodus.

550
00:26:11,015 --> 00:26:14,044
All of them were officers
on the <i>Okinawa</i>

551
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:15,683
when I was Leyton's X.O.

552
00:26:15,725 --> 00:26:18,322
As far as I can tell,
every officer on this list

553
00:26:18,364 --> 00:26:20,266
served under Leyton
at one time or another.

554
00:26:20,301 --> 00:26:24,036
And now they're all
in key positions here on Earth.

555
00:26:24,074 --> 00:26:27,046
Or commanding ships
somewhere in this sector.

556
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,350
It says here, he's ordered
another set of transfers.

557
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,485
Take a look at these dates.

558
00:26:33,527 --> 00:26:36,260
They all take effect
on the 14th.

559
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,363
A day before
the President's speech.

560
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:41,874
Do you think
there's any connection?

561
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,582
Maybe Admiral Leyton
doesn't intend

562
00:26:45,618 --> 00:26:48,181
for the President
to make his speech.

563
00:26:48,223 --> 00:26:50,056
Hmm.

564
00:26:50,093 --> 00:26:51,561
I better get a copy of this.

565
00:26:53,834 --> 00:26:57,204
Odo, if Admiral Leyton
is planning

566
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,074
some kind of takeover
on the 14th

567
00:26:59,111 --> 00:27:00,101
I want to make sure

568
00:27:00,147 --> 00:27:01,912
that Jake and my father
are safe.

569
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,649
We should get them off Earth
as soon as possible.

570
00:27:07,729 --> 00:27:09,323
Come in.

571
00:27:10,368 --> 00:27:11,666
Captain.

572
00:27:11,703 --> 00:27:14,173
I'm surprised to find you here.

573
00:27:14,209 --> 00:27:15,872
Just cleaning out
some of my files.

574
00:27:15,911 --> 00:27:18,781
I'll see you later, Constable.

575
00:27:18,817 --> 00:27:20,719
Good night, Captain.

576
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,359
I hear congratulations
are in order.

577
00:27:27,735 --> 00:27:29,135
Your promotion...

578
00:27:29,172 --> 00:27:30,698
Captain of the <i>Lakota.</i>

579
00:27:30,741 --> 00:27:33,770
Thanks, but it's
still a few days away.

580
00:27:33,814 --> 00:27:36,182
The <i>Lakota</i> won't be
done with its refit

581
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:37,551
until the 14th.

582
00:27:37,588 --> 00:27:40,685
I guess that will make
the 14th a special day.

583
00:27:40,728 --> 00:27:43,359
I'm looking forward to it.

584
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,270
Too bad you won't be around
for the ceremony.

585
00:27:46,306 --> 00:27:47,365
Oh, who knows?

586
00:27:47,408 --> 00:27:49,378
I might be able to fit it in.

587
00:27:49,412 --> 00:27:52,851
I thought Admiral Leyton ordered
you back to Deep Space 9.

588
00:27:52,885 --> 00:27:55,378
He did, but I've got
some leave coming

589
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,291
and I've decided to take it.

590
00:27:57,328 --> 00:28:01,063
After all, I don't get
much time to spend on Earth

591
00:28:01,102 --> 00:28:04,302
and it is so pleasant here.

592
00:28:04,342 --> 00:28:07,405
With a Starfleet officer
on every corner

593
00:28:07,515 --> 00:28:12,651
paradise has never
seemed so well armed.

594
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:15,960
You're a very
interesting man, Captain.

595
00:28:15,998 --> 00:28:19,870
I'm sorry we didn't get
to work together longer.

596
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,758
Admiral. I didn't expect
to see you here.

597
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:33,128
I'm sure you didn't.

598
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:35,636
Captain, your arm, please.

599
00:28:38,142 --> 00:28:40,374
Do as she asks.

600
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:05,726
Just as I said, Mr. President.

601
00:29:05,764 --> 00:29:07,757
He's a shape-shifter.

602
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,167
You going to tell me how
you faked the blood test?

603
00:29:27,207 --> 00:29:29,370
Does it matter?

604
00:29:29,412 --> 00:29:31,314
I suppose not.

605
00:29:32,618 --> 00:29:34,052
You know, Ben...

606
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:37,793
I stand here looking at you...

607
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:42,394
the best officer
who ever served under me...

608
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:46,504
trapped in this holding cell...

609
00:29:48,517 --> 00:29:50,043
and I think...

610
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,258
life can be damned cruel.

611
00:29:54,295 --> 00:29:55,992
Let me out.

612
00:29:56,031 --> 00:29:59,003
Maybe life will look
a little better.

613
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:05,572
I don't think
I can do that just now.

614
00:30:05,617 --> 00:30:07,587
So what are you going to do?

615
00:30:07,688 --> 00:30:10,421
Keep me here forever?

616
00:30:11,763 --> 00:30:14,929
You'll be free
to go in a few days.

617
00:30:14,969 --> 00:30:16,529
Let me guess.

618
00:30:16,573 --> 00:30:19,204
After the President's speech.

619
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:25,122
The President won't
be making a speech.

620
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,454
I will.

621
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:30,729
I assume you'll be explaining
to the public why it's necessary

622
00:30:30,768 --> 00:30:33,501
for Starfleet
to seize control of Earth.

623
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,533
Temporarily, of course...

624
00:30:35,577 --> 00:30:39,603
until the changeling threat
has been neutralized.

625
00:30:39,736 --> 00:30:41,968
And how long will that be?

626
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,636
Months? Years?

627
00:30:43,678 --> 00:30:44,839
Decades?

628
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,009
However long it takes.

629
00:30:47,051 --> 00:30:50,752
The people deserve
strong leadership...

630
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:53,593
someone who can protect them.

631
00:30:53,631 --> 00:30:55,760
In other words...

632
00:30:55,802 --> 00:30:57,328
you.

633
00:31:04,386 --> 00:31:06,879
If you need anything...

634
00:31:08,894 --> 00:31:10,830
food, something to read...

635
00:31:12,134 --> 00:31:13,899
just tell the guards.

636
00:31:33,811 --> 00:31:35,974
Well, if it isn't
my favorite vampire.

637
00:31:36,015 --> 00:31:37,848
Vampires come out at night.

638
00:31:37,886 --> 00:31:40,118
I've been pushing
this cart all day.

639
00:31:40,157 --> 00:31:43,129
Look, I'm getting a little tired
of all these blood screenings.

640
00:31:43,163 --> 00:31:45,156
Believe me, I'm as tired
of giving them

641
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,463
as you are of taking them.

642
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:49,134
Why don't you give me
one of those while you're at it?

643
00:31:49,175 --> 00:31:51,840
You don't really expect me
to let down that force field

644
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,009
and go in there with you?

645
00:31:54,953 --> 00:31:56,046
Sisko's not the one

646
00:31:56,088 --> 00:31:58,115
you should be worried about...
I am.

647
00:31:58,661 --> 00:32:01,428
Come here.

648
00:32:06,142 --> 00:32:07,167
Nicely done, Constable.

649
00:32:07,211 --> 00:32:09,272
Well, it wasn't
that difficult, considering

650
00:32:09,315 --> 00:32:12,219
I helped you revise the security
measures for this building.

651
00:32:12,254 --> 00:32:13,222
Lucky for me.

652
00:32:13,256 --> 00:32:14,656
Have you contacted Major Kira?

653
00:32:14,693 --> 00:32:17,631
The <i>Defiant</i> is
on its way to Earth.

654
00:32:17,665 --> 00:32:20,364
That must mean they found
what we were looking for.

655
00:32:20,403 --> 00:32:22,168
Ah, it was just as you
suspected.

656
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:24,473
They even found
the officer responsible...

657
00:32:24,546 --> 00:32:25,844
Lieutenant Arriaga.

658
00:32:25,882 --> 00:32:27,784
They've put him on the <i>Defiant.</i>

659
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:29,413
You have to get
to the President.

660
00:32:29,456 --> 00:32:31,653
Tell him everything
we know and warn him

661
00:32:31,693 --> 00:32:33,788
that Leyton is going
to make his move

662
00:32:33,831 --> 00:32:34,821
sometime today.

663
00:32:34,866 --> 00:32:35,834
What about you?

664
00:32:35,868 --> 00:32:37,667
I've got some business
to take care of.

665
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:38,695
Right.

666
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,157
I understand the situation,
Admiral.

667
00:32:48,192 --> 00:32:49,923
I'll do my best.

668
00:32:49,963 --> 00:32:51,796
Good luck, Captain Benteen.

669
00:32:51,833 --> 00:32:53,826
Leyton out.

670
00:32:58,747 --> 00:33:01,081
Are you planning on using that?

671
00:33:01,118 --> 00:33:03,111
Against a fellow officer?

672
00:33:03,156 --> 00:33:04,488
I hope not.

673
00:33:04,592 --> 00:33:07,621
But I will have to ask
for your resignation.

674
00:33:07,665 --> 00:33:09,031
You'll forgive me

675
00:33:09,068 --> 00:33:11,265
if I don't leap
at the opportunity.

676
00:33:11,305 --> 00:33:14,471
I have enough evidence
to convict you of treason.

677
00:33:16,482 --> 00:33:17,677
Do you?

678
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:20,053
We have Lieutenant
Arriaga in custody.

679
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:22,492
He is prepared to admit
that under your orders

680
00:33:22,528 --> 00:33:25,625
he attached a subspace modulator
to the relay satellite

681
00:33:25,668 --> 00:33:27,535
on the far side of the wormhole.

682
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:30,941
That is why it was opening
and closing at random.

683
00:33:30,978 --> 00:33:32,845
Why would anyone
want to do that?

684
00:33:32,882 --> 00:33:34,282
To make it look like

685
00:33:34,318 --> 00:33:37,518
a cloaked Dominion fleet
was entering Federation space

686
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:40,553
so that when the Earth's
power relays were sabotaged

687
00:33:40,631 --> 00:33:43,762
the people would think
that an invasion was imminent.

688
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:47,904
That's a very interesting theory

689
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:50,576
but it's not going
to do you much good.

690
00:33:50,651 --> 00:33:53,817
Lieutenant Arriaga
isn't going to get to Earth.

691
00:33:53,857 --> 00:33:57,023
I've sent the <i>Lakota</i>
to intercept the <i>Defiant.</i>

692
00:33:57,064 --> 00:33:59,296
You think that one
Starfleet ship

693
00:33:59,334 --> 00:34:01,770
is going to fire on another?

694
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:05,211
As far as Captain Benteen's crew
is concerned

695
00:34:05,246 --> 00:34:07,877
the <i>Defiant</i> isn't
a Starfleet ship.

696
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,016
They've been told
everyone on the <i>Defiant</i>

697
00:34:11,058 --> 00:34:13,757
has been replaced
by shape-shifters.

698
00:34:20,343 --> 00:34:22,245
Commander, we're being hailed
by the <i>Lakota.</i>

699
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,373
They're ordering us

700
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:25,579
to drop out of warp
and prepare to be boarded.

701
00:34:25,654 --> 00:34:27,590
They raised their shields
and powered up their phasers.

702
00:34:27,658 --> 00:34:29,287
Looks like they won't
take no for an answer.

703
00:34:36,843 --> 00:34:39,838
Admiral, do you realize
what's going on here?

704
00:34:39,883 --> 00:34:41,944
Even if you win,
even if you manage

705
00:34:41,987 --> 00:34:44,618
to oust Jaresh-Inyo,
you still lose.

706
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:46,652
We all lose.

707
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:52,437
I can't say I agree with you.

708
00:34:52,474 --> 00:34:54,410
Do you think other
Federation worlds

709
00:34:54,444 --> 00:34:56,573
are going to sit back
and let their President

710
00:34:56,616 --> 00:34:58,916
be replaced
by a military dictatorship?

711
00:34:58,954 --> 00:35:00,981
Hardly a dictatorship, Ben.

712
00:35:02,027 --> 00:35:06,195
Overthrowing
a legitimately elected president

713
00:35:06,235 --> 00:35:10,266
and giving Starfleet direct
control over the government?

714
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:13,111
It sounds
like a dictatorship to me.

715
00:35:13,149 --> 00:35:15,848
And I'm sure I'm not
the only one who thinks so.

716
00:35:17,925 --> 00:35:20,327
There will be some dissenters
at first.

717
00:35:20,363 --> 00:35:21,558
But they'll fall in line

718
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,626
once they realize
that strengthening Earth

719
00:35:23,737 --> 00:35:26,868
is the first step toward
strengthening the Federation.

720
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,609
And what if they don't agree?
What then?

721
00:35:29,649 --> 00:35:32,416
Are you willing
to risk a civil war?

722
00:35:32,454 --> 00:35:34,219
If the <i>Lakota</i> fires
on the <i>Defiant</i>

723
00:35:34,258 --> 00:35:36,524
you will be opening up
a Pandora's box

724
00:35:36,562 --> 00:35:38,395
that may never be closed.

725
00:35:38,432 --> 00:35:42,668
Then contact the <i>Defiant</i>
and tell them to stand down.

726
00:35:44,411 --> 00:35:47,076
I won't do that.

727
00:35:49,154 --> 00:35:51,283
I didn't think so.

728
00:35:51,325 --> 00:35:53,557
But don't kid yourself, Ben.

729
00:35:53,596 --> 00:35:57,331
This Pandora's box of yours...

730
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:59,863
we're opening it together.

731
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,043
The <i>Lakota's</i> targeting
their weapons

732
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,105
on our warp engines.

733
00:36:13,149 --> 00:36:14,709
They're bluffing.
That's a Federation ship.

734
00:36:14,752 --> 00:36:15,947
They're not going to fire on us.

735
00:36:15,988 --> 00:36:17,617
I hope you're right
about that, Chief.

736
00:36:17,657 --> 00:36:19,057
Continue on course.

737
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:21,759
We're in weapons' range.

738
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,326
Raise shields.

739
00:36:33,356 --> 00:36:34,824
Damage report.

740
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,954
Port shields are at 60 percent.

741
00:36:36,997 --> 00:36:39,229
Someone's been upgrading
the <i>Lakota's</i> weapons.

742
00:36:39,268 --> 00:36:42,001
That's a lot of fire power
for an Excelsior-class ship.

743
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,703
Can we cloak?

744
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:45,543
We would have to lower shields.

745
00:36:46,549 --> 00:36:48,178
I wouldn't advise it.

746
00:36:48,219 --> 00:36:50,712
Do we make a run for it?

747
00:36:50,758 --> 00:36:52,284
If they've been tinkering
with the weapons

748
00:36:52,327 --> 00:36:54,024
who knows what they've done
to the warp drive.

749
00:36:54,064 --> 00:36:55,123
Hail them.

750
00:36:57,337 --> 00:36:59,170
No answer.

751
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,606
They're trying
to disable our engines.

752
00:37:02,647 --> 00:37:03,876
Let's go.

753
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:06,387
We've got to get you
to the medical bay.

754
00:37:07,691 --> 00:37:09,490
What do we do, Commander?

755
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:14,025
We fight.

756
00:37:15,707 --> 00:37:17,404
Target their weapons.

757
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:19,073
Fire phasers.

758
00:37:33,276 --> 00:37:34,642
Want some?

759
00:37:34,678 --> 00:37:37,650
It's Bolian tonic water...
calms the nerves.

760
00:37:37,684 --> 00:37:38,913
No, thank you.

761
00:37:48,739 --> 00:37:51,175
Ironic, isn't it?

762
00:37:51,211 --> 00:37:53,306
When you came on board
the <i>Okinawa</i>

763
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:55,182
you were more interested

764
00:37:55,219 --> 00:37:58,555
in engineering and ship design
than command.

765
00:37:58,592 --> 00:38:01,393
But I promoted you
to Lieutenant Commander.

766
00:38:01,432 --> 00:38:03,868
Gave you the post
of Executive Officer

767
00:38:03,904 --> 00:38:07,001
and taught you everything I knew
about being a leader.

768
00:38:07,043 --> 00:38:08,979
You were a good teacher.

769
00:38:09,014 --> 00:38:11,382
Mm-hmm.

770
00:38:11,418 --> 00:38:15,859
I only wish I'd taught you more
about the importance of loyalty.

771
00:38:17,497 --> 00:38:21,096
You want to talk to me
about loyalty?

772
00:38:21,138 --> 00:38:24,406
After you broke your oath
with the Federation

773
00:38:24,444 --> 00:38:27,041
lied to the people of Earth?

774
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:31,285
Ordered one of our own starships
to fire on another!

775
00:38:33,162 --> 00:38:35,359
You don't have the right.

776
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,338
You don't understand me
at all, do you?

777
00:38:38,372 --> 00:38:40,171
I used to think I did.

778
00:38:40,209 --> 00:38:43,045
I used to think that you
were a man of principles

779
00:38:43,082 --> 00:38:44,779
a man of honor.

780
00:38:44,818 --> 00:38:46,811
I see that I was mistaken.

781
00:38:46,856 --> 00:38:49,726
I'm sorry you feel that way.

782
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:52,824
So am I.

783
00:38:52,868 --> 00:38:57,138
Admiral, we're receiving
a message from the <i>Lakota.</i>

784
00:38:58,646 --> 00:39:00,012
Put it through.

785
00:39:00,049 --> 00:39:02,451
We've been unable to stop
the <i>Defiant.</i>

786
00:39:02,487 --> 00:39:05,425
Someone has equipped her
with ablative armor

787
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,330
and neglected to inform
Starfleet Operations.

788
00:39:08,365 --> 00:39:11,166
Under no circumstances is
that ship to reach Earth.

789
00:39:11,205 --> 00:39:14,006
The <i>Lakota's</i> carrying
quantum torpedoes, isn't she?

790
00:39:14,044 --> 00:39:15,103
Yes, sir.

791
00:39:15,146 --> 00:39:16,444
Then use them.

792
00:39:16,482 --> 00:39:19,352
Admiral...

793
00:39:19,387 --> 00:39:21,357
my orders were to disable
the <i>Defiant</i>

794
00:39:21,391 --> 00:39:22,359
not destroy her.

795
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,226
Your orders are
to keep the <i>Defiant</i>

796
00:39:24,264 --> 00:39:27,464
from reaching Earth by any means
necessary, is that understood?

797
00:39:27,504 --> 00:39:29,940
Yes, it is.

798
00:39:29,976 --> 00:39:31,809
Captain,
you know as well as I do

799
00:39:31,845 --> 00:39:34,817
that there aren't any
shape-shifters on the <i>Defiant.</i>

800
00:39:34,851 --> 00:39:36,377
Use those quantum torpedoes

801
00:39:36,421 --> 00:39:38,914
and you will be killing
50 Starfleet officers.

802
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,260
Captain Benteen knows
where her duty lies.

803
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:43,632
You have your orders.

804
00:39:43,669 --> 00:39:45,662
Yes, sir.

805
00:39:48,612 --> 00:39:49,910
Shields are almost gone.

806
00:39:49,949 --> 00:39:52,249
We have major systems failures
on decks 1, 3 and 4.

807
00:39:52,287 --> 00:39:53,482
What about the <i>Lakota?</i>

808
00:39:53,522 --> 00:39:54,820
They're in worse shape.

809
00:39:54,858 --> 00:39:56,657
One good hit
will probably finish them.

810
00:39:56,695 --> 00:39:57,822
And kill everyone on board.

811
00:39:57,864 --> 00:39:59,390
That is not an option.

812
00:39:59,434 --> 00:40:00,902
It's either them or us.

813
00:40:02,373 --> 00:40:04,309
Mr. Worf, I think
you should look at this.

814
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,654
They have powered down
their weapons.

815
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:11,851
Hold your fire.

816
00:40:11,892 --> 00:40:13,019
Commander!

817
00:40:13,062 --> 00:40:14,223
They're hailing us.

818
00:40:15,766 --> 00:40:17,497
On screen.

819
00:40:17,637 --> 00:40:20,370
Admiral Leyton,
we are receiving a message

820
00:40:20,409 --> 00:40:22,879
for Captain Sisko
from the <i>Defiant.</i>

821
00:40:22,914 --> 00:40:25,180
Put him through.

822
00:40:26,788 --> 00:40:28,120
Do as he says.

823
00:40:28,158 --> 00:40:29,821
Patching it in, sir.

824
00:40:32,233 --> 00:40:34,430
I apologize for the delay,
Captain.

825
00:40:34,471 --> 00:40:35,997
What's your status,
Mr. Worf?

826
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:38,102
The <i>Lakota</i> has powered
down its weapons

827
00:40:38,145 --> 00:40:40,240
and is allowing us
to proceed to Earth.

828
00:40:40,282 --> 00:40:41,750
Casualties?

829
00:40:41,852 --> 00:40:43,879
Bartlett and Ramsey are dead,
sir.

830
00:40:43,922 --> 00:40:45,619
Seven others seriously injured.

831
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,860
Captain Benteen thinks there
may be as many as 24 casualties

832
00:40:48,899 --> 00:40:50,060
on the <i>Lakota.</i>

833
00:40:50,102 --> 00:40:52,004
Get here as soon as you can.

834
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,771
The President's expecting you.

835
00:40:53,809 --> 00:40:54,868
Aye, sir.

836
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,751
That was a mistake, Ben...

837
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,694
talking to your ship
from my office.

838
00:41:03,729 --> 00:41:05,961
Now that security
knows you're here

839
00:41:06,001 --> 00:41:07,937
you'll never make it
past that door.

840
00:41:07,971 --> 00:41:09,838
It doesn't matter

841
00:41:09,874 --> 00:41:11,605
whether I get out
of here or not.

842
00:41:11,645 --> 00:41:15,585
By now, Odo is talking
to Jaresh-Inyo.

843
00:41:15,619 --> 00:41:18,934
The President will have
all the evidence he needs

844
00:41:19,068 --> 00:41:19,899
to stop you.

845
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:20,961
It's over.

846
00:41:21,006 --> 00:41:23,169
It's not over!

847
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:29,785
I have enough loyal officers
to make a fight of it.

848
00:41:29,822 --> 00:41:31,085
Who will you fight?

849
00:41:31,126 --> 00:41:33,494
Starfleet?
The Federation?

850
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:36,297
Don't you see, Admiral?

851
00:41:36,336 --> 00:41:38,704
You're fighting the wrong war.

852
00:41:40,711 --> 00:41:45,744
And as for your loyal officers,
Benteen's already abandoned you.

853
00:41:45,788 --> 00:41:48,624
And she was closer
to you than anyone.

854
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,630
You've lost.

855
00:41:50,664 --> 00:41:54,331
Don't make anyone else
pay for your mistakes.

856
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,316
I hope...

857
00:42:17,384 --> 00:42:19,981
you're not the one
making the mistake.

858
00:42:50,918 --> 00:42:53,754
The streets are going to
seem emptier with them gone.

859
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:55,987
Would you be happier
if they'd stayed?

860
00:42:56,028 --> 00:42:57,394
Oh, if they'd stayed

861
00:42:57,464 --> 00:43:00,197
it wouldn't be Earth
anymore, would it?

862
00:43:00,237 --> 00:43:04,541
It didn't seem right...
all those phasers everywhere.

863
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,480
Something wrong, Odo?

864
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,717
Am I the only one who's worried

865
00:43:10,757 --> 00:43:13,354
that there are still
changelings here on Earth?

866
00:43:13,396 --> 00:43:14,591
Worried?

867
00:43:14,632 --> 00:43:16,932
I'm scared to death,
but I'll be damned

868
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:19,498
if I'm going to let them change
the way I live my life.

869
00:43:19,542 --> 00:43:20,669
If the changelings

870
00:43:20,711 --> 00:43:22,111
want to destroy
what we've built here

871
00:43:22,147 --> 00:43:23,810
they're going to have
to do it themselves.

872
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:26,047
We will not do it for them.

873
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:29,618
I'm going to miss you, son.

874
00:43:33,803 --> 00:43:37,173
You too, Jake-o.

875
00:43:37,211 --> 00:43:39,010
Feels like you just got here.

876
00:43:39,047 --> 00:43:41,142
You sure
we can't convince you

877
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:42,517
to come back
to the station with us?

878
00:43:42,554 --> 00:43:44,022
A Creole restaurant
would be a big hit

879
00:43:44,057 --> 00:43:45,355
on the Promenade.

880
00:43:45,394 --> 00:43:47,626
Then you'll just have
to open one.

881
00:43:47,665 --> 00:43:49,430
This is my home.

882
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:52,736
Well, we'd better get going.

883
00:43:52,775 --> 00:43:54,904
Now, don't forget...

884
00:43:54,945 --> 00:43:56,413
Take my medicine.
I know.

885
00:43:56,449 --> 00:43:58,749
Is he always such a mother hen?

886
00:43:58,787 --> 00:44:00,278
He means well.

887
00:44:03,128 --> 00:44:04,757
Take care of yourselves.

888
00:44:04,799 --> 00:44:06,233
I'll do my best.

889
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:07,932
That's all I can ask.

890
00:44:09,642 --> 00:44:12,808
Three to beam up.

891
00:44:22,167 --> 00:44:24,103
Well, what are you waiting for?

892
00:44:24,137 --> 00:44:25,435
Come in. Have a seat.

893
00:44:25,507 --> 00:44:28,308
Today I'm recommending
the pasta boudin.

894
00:44:28,346 --> 00:44:31,477
It's got a bit of a kick,
but it will make you smile.
