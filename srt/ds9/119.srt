1
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:09,259
We never cared what we did as long
as it annoyed the grown-ups.

2
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:13,096
All inner deflector shield subsystems
are showing equal intensity.

3
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:18,560
Power balance levels are reading normal.
I was a champion window breaker.

4
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:22,647
On a dark night
with a few rocks I was deadly.

5
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,400
Um, which 'you' are you talking about?

6
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,236
( console beeping )

7
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:30,572
We're being hailed
by an incoming freighter.

8
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,157
Open a channel.

9
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:37,829
On screen. Welcome to DS9.
I'm Major Kira Nerys.

10
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,081
<i>This is the Kobheerian Freighter</i>
Rak-Miunis

11
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,708
<i>requesting permission to dock.</i>

12
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:45,003
Docking Port 6 is clear for approach.

13
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,839
<i>Thank you. We have a passenger on board</i>

14
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,549
<i>requiring medical assistance.</i>

15
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,885
Can you tell us what's wrong
with your passenger?

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,429
<i>He says it's a condition</i>
<i>called Kalla-Nohra.</i>

17
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:57,223
<i>It's apparently chronic</i>
<i>but he doesn't have his medication.</i>

18
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,559
Beam him directly to our Infirmary.

19
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,227
We'll have our doctor standing by.

20
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,272
<i>Thank you, Commander.</i> Rak-Miunis<i> out.</i>

21
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,107
Dax to Infirmary.

22
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,109
<i>This is Bashir. Go ahead.</i>

23
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,779
A Kobheerian transport
is about to beam a patient to you.

24
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:13,782
He's suffering from something
called Kalla-Nohra.

25
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,868
<i>I'm not aware of it.</i>
<i>I'll check the computer.</i>

26
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,957
Commander, I'd like to go down
to the Infirmary and meet that patient.

27
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,459
Of course. Why?

28
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:29,047
The only cases of Kalla-Nohra I know
of were the result of a mining accident

29
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,800
at a Bajoran forced labor camp
that I helped liberate.

30
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:36,513
The survivors of Gallitep have always been
a symbol to us of strength and courage.

31
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:39,891
By all means, Major.
Take as much time as you want.

32
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,534
Ah, Major. I'll be right with you.

33
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,624
-Kira to Odo.
<i>-Go ahead.</i>

34
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:07,669
I'm in the Infirmary.
I need security here on the double.

35
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:08,837
<i>I'm on my way, Major.</i>

36
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,543
What's the matter, Major?

37
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,545
Your patient is a criminal.

38
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,885
( grunts )

39
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,014
Good afternoon.

40
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,685
{\an8}I assume this is the problem.

41
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,478
{\an8}-MARRITZA: Problem?
-Lock him up.

42
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,730
{\an8}This is outrageous. On what charge?

43
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,192
{\an8}Will somebody tell me what's going on?
This man needs medical care.

44
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,445
{\an8}-Then give it to him in his cell.
-I haven't done anything.

45
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,738
{\an8}Then why did you run?

46
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,408
{\an8}I'm trying to get away
from this Bajoran fanatic.

47
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,536
{\an8}The look of hate in her eyes,
she'd like to kill me.

48
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,997
{\an8}Oh? And why would that be?

49
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,165
{\an8}Well, it's obvious. I'm a Cardassian.

50
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:55,628
{\an8}He's not just any Cardassian.
He's a war criminal.

51
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,638
{\an8}So you're saying this man...
what's his name?

52
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,682
{\an8}Marritza. Aamin Marritza.

53
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:10,018
{\an8}You're saying
Marritza's on the Bajorans' list

54
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,894
{\an8}for Cardassians wanted for war crimes?

55
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,188
{\an8}He's not on any list

56
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,816
{\an8}I've seen, Commander,
and I've got them all.

57
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,943
{\an8}I don't care whether he's listed or not...

58
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:19,986
{\an8}Hold on, Major.

59
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,405
{\an8}Marritza is traveling
on a Federation ship.

60
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,783
{\an8}He comes here for a medical emergency
and we throw him into a security cell.

61
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,618
{\an8}I, for one, hope he's listed.

62
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,621
{\an8}Commander, I know
what I've done isn't exactly policy

63
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,540
{\an8}and may not even be legal, but it's right.

64
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,292
{\an8}All right, Major, what do we charge
him with?

65
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,295
{\an8}I'm charging him
with having contracted Kalla-Nohra.

66
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,172
{\an8}Do you want to explain that to me?

67
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,591
{\an8}The only way he could have
contracted that condition

68
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,760
{\an8}was to have served
at the Gallitep labor camp

69
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,386
{\an8}at the time of the mining accident.

70
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:48,014
{\an8}So, that makes him a war
criminal, just being there?

71
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,976
{\an8}Commander,
if you'd been there 12 years ago

72
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,855
{\an8}when we liberated that camp
if you'd seen the things I saw

73
00:05:56,522 --> 00:06:00,735
all those Bajoran bodies,
starved, brutalized...

74
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,112
Do you know what Cardassian policy was?

75
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,906
Oh, I'm not even talking about the murder.

76
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,449
Murder was just the end
of the fun for them.

77
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,867
First came the humiliation.

78
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,037
Mothers raped in front of their children,

79
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,123
husbands beaten until their wives
couldn't recognize them,

80
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:17,293
old people buried alive,
because they couldn't work anymore.

81
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,387
I think I'll have a talk with our guest.

82
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,015
-I'll come with you.
-No, Major.

83
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,142
It'd be better if I spoke to him alone.

84
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,572
How do you feel?

85
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,658
Better, thank you.

86
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,370
I'm Benjamin Sisko.
I'm in charge of this station.

87
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,456
Oh, finally. The Federation to the rescue.

88
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,334
Are you going to get me out of here?

89
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,919
I hope so.

90
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,840
Tell me, how did you contract
Kalla-Nohra Syndrome?

91
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:07,426
I don't have Kalla-Nohra.
I have Pottrik Syndrome.

92
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,720
The freighter captain
said it was Kalla-Nohra.

93
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,514
A very similar condition.

94
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,183
Take the same medication,
as a matter of fact.

95
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,602
Then you didn't serve
at the Gallitep labor camp?

96
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,896
Labor camp? ( chuckles )

97
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:25,361
No. I've never been to Bajor.
I was a military file clerk.

98
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:30,700
I reside now on Kora II
where I boarded a freighter

99
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,578
which, unfortunately for me, came here.

100
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,164
Now, Commander,
if you have no more questions

101
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,373
I'd like to be on my way.

102
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,833
Am I still drunk

103
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,212
or am I in jail with a Cardassian?

104
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,714
Odo!

105
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:48,176
You're not keeping me in here
with one of those.

106
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:49,844
Odo!

107
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,013
Odo!

108
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:55,099
I put myself in your hands, Commander.

109
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,569
Let me get this straight.

110
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,321
You're saying Marritza
does have Kalla-Nohra?

111
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,948
BASHIR: There's no doubt about it.
He has all the symptoms.

112
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,743
And when I ran a lower pulmonary
bio-probe, he read positive.

113
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,078
And you're sure
he doesn't have Pottrik Syndrome?

114
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:20,458
Yes, absolutely. If he had Pottrik's
the bio-probe would have been negative.

115
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,461
Then he was at the Gallitep labor camp.

116
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:24,712
Definitely.

117
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,590
I've cross-checked all Bajoran
and Federation medical records

118
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,384
and there's simply no other way
he could have gotten this condition.

119
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,302
<i>Kira to Sisko.</i>

120
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:32,553
Yes, Major?

121
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,765
<i>Commander, there's an incoming</i>
<i>transmission for you from Bajor.</i>

122
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,308
<i>It's the Minister of State.</i>

123
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,228
Thank you. If you'll excuse me, Doctor.

124
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,151
Minister Kaval. Good day, sir.

125
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,779
<i>And to you, Commander.</i>
<i>I trust you're in good health.</i>

126
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,322
<i>Things are going well on the station?</i>

127
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,615
Quite well, thank you.

128
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,451
<i>That's wonderful.</i>
<i>I'm told you've performed</i>

129
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,578
<i>a special service for Bajor today.</i>

130
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:58,996
<i>Congratulations to you.</i>

131
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,873
I don't quite follow.

132
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,418
<i>You're not holding</i>
<i>a certain Cardassian for us?</i>

133
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,588
We are holding a Cardassian temporarily.

134
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,633
<i>By temporarily, you mean, </i>
<i>until you are satisfied</i>

135
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,177
<i>that a verified identification</i>
<i>has been made.</i>

136
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,347
Minister, I'm not sure
we have the grounds to hold him that long.

137
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:20,726
<i>I fully understand your concerns, </i>
<i>Commander but since our Major Kira</i>

138
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,313
<i>has accepted responsibility in this matter</i>
<i>the burden is off your shoulders.</i>

139
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,356
I don't agree.

140
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:30,861
<i>Commander if this Marritza was at Gallitep</i>
<i>we want him, and we will have him.</i>

141
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,405
<i>Is that clear?</i>

142
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,198
It is.

143
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:35,908
<i>Good.</i>

144
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,037
<i>We'll chat again soon.</i>
<i>Good day, Commander.</i>

145
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,019
SISKO: May I join you?

146
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,231
Actually, I was just about to pay a visit
to our friend, Marritza.

147
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,734
That's what I want to talk
to you about, Major.

148
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,737
I'd like Odo to handle this investigation.

149
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:14,989
Why?

150
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,033
He's our Chief of Security.

151
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:22,538
-Minister Kaval put me in charge.
-Minister Kaval doesn't run this station.

152
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:26,000
And the Federation has no right
telling us how to deal with our criminals.

153
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,960
If it turns out that he is a criminal

154
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,421
then he'll be yours,
and you're welcome to him.

155
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,758
Until then,
he's just a traveler under suspicion.

156
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,177
( sighs )

157
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:43,059
You think this is all some personal
vendetta on my part, don't you?

158
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,728
I think you're too close
to be objective, yes.

159
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,688
You're right. I'm not objective.

160
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:54,070
But I'm your First Officer,
and I give you my word

161
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,238
I will conduct myself accordingly.

162
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:07,208
You once said we were friends.
I'm asking you now, as a friend,

163
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,837
please, let me conduct this investigation.

164
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,048
I owe it to them.

165
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,969
-You mean the victims.
-That's right.

166
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,682
The ones who moved too slowly
and never moved again.

167
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,898
I'm asking for all the Bajorans
who can't ask.

168
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,235
Let a Bajoran do this.

169
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,453
Sisko to Odo.

170
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,579
ODO:<i> Go ahead.</i>

171
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:52,253
Constable, Major Kira will be in charge
of the Marritza investigation.

172
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,588
ODO: <i>I understand.</i>

173
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,635
Thank you.

174
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,275
KIRA: Constable.

175
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,985
It's about time you let me out.

176
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,530
Try to stay out of trouble
for a day or two, will you?

177
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,990
I'll do my best.

178
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:26,662
Oh, and Odo, let me know
when you hang the Cardassian.

179
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,294
I've begun a background check on Marritza.

180
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,921
So far he is what he says he is.

181
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,383
He boarded that Kobheerian
freighter at Kora II

182
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:40,926
where he's worked as an instructor

183
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,929
at a military academy
for the past five years.

184
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,639
Keep looking.

185
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,392
Don't worry, Major, I intend to.

186
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,479
I'll be with the prisoner if you need me.

187
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,737
MARRITZA: My compliments
on your replicators, Major.

188
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:04,825
But the <i>sem'hal </i>stew
could use a little <i>yamoksauce.</i>

189
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,037
-I'm glad you're enjoying it.
-I doubt that, Major.

190
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,580
I doubt it very much.

191
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,459
I hope it won't disturb your dinner
if I ask you a few questions.

192
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,670
-If I refuse to answer?
-I'll ask them anyway.

193
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,172
Of course.

194
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,133
This is my job.

195
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,512
Persecuting Cardassians goes far beyond
your job, Major.

196
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:25,638
It's your passion.

197
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,852
You claim you were never at Gallitep.

198
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,854
MARITZZA: I missed that honor.

199
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,692
-And that your illness is not Kalla-Nohra.
-Again, true.

200
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,110
Again, false.

201
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,239
Our doctor confirmed
you do have Kalla-Nohra

202
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,199
which means you were at Gallitep.

203
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,036
If your lies are going
to be this transparent

204
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,497
it's going to be a very
short interrogation.

205
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,252
Well, in that case, I'll try to make
my lies more opaque.

206
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,758
What was your rank at Gallitep?
What were your duties?

207
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,260
You don't want to know.

208
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,012
-Just answer the question.
-You'll be disappointed.

209
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,391
I'll risk it.

210
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:17,398
I had the distinction of serving
in the exalted position of filing clerk.

211
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,567
Filing clerk?

212
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,735
I told you you'd be disappointed.

213
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,073
Actually, I would have preferred
to avoid military service altogether

214
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:29,952
but I had the good fortune to be posted
to the records office at Gallitep

215
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,829
and I turned out
to be an exemplary file clerk.

216
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,914
In 14 units of service

217
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:38,043
I never misplaced or lost a record.
I received numerous commendations.

218
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,963
Gul Darhe'el, himself,
called my computer filing system,

219
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,049
"a masterpiece of meticulous exactitude."

220
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,136
Well, there you are. My secret's out.

221
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,305
My crimes laid bare.

222
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,348
I await execution.

223
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,643
I hope we don't keep you waiting long.

224
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,902
You know, I never heard of a filing clerk

225
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,696
becoming an instructor
at a military academy.

226
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,324
-Until now.
-What did you teach?

227
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,368
-Believe it or not, filing.
-I can verify that.

228
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,536
Be my guest.

229
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,414
I still think you're a liar.

230
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,878
So much for our search
for the truth. Now we trade insults.

231
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,798
You admit you worked under Gul Darhe'el.

232
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:26,884
We all did.

233
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,303
I take it, then, you witnessed
the atrocities.

234
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,429
Atrocities?

235
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,681
What atrocities?

236
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,647
Oh, I vaguely recall hearing
a scream from time to time.

237
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,650
Atrocities? No.

238
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:48,113
You expect me to believe you knew nothing
of the murders, the tortures?

239
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,659
-You never saw the bodies?
-Of course I saw bodies.

240
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,577
People died all the time at Gallitep

241
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,747
mining accidents, illnesses,
feuds among the workers.

242
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,168
-You're saying Bajorans killed each other?
-At times.

243
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,506
Over food, a blanket, a woman.

244
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,426
The conditions were harsh.
It was a labor camp, Major.

245
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:14,181
I helped liberate that camp.
I saw the bodies.

246
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,641
I know how they died.

247
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,851
You saw what we wanted you to see.

248
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,605
Who do you think started the rumors
about brutality at Gallitep?

249
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,691
It was Gul Darhe'el himself.

250
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,152
Now, there was a leader.
Brilliant, extraordinary man.

251
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:30,364
He knew that to rule by fear
was to rule completely.

252
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:35,035
Why bother with actual mass murders
when just the reports of such incidents

253
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,538
would have the same effect?

254
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,123
Which was?

255
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,083
You know as well as I do, Major.

256
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,585
To keep you Bajorans thinking
of yourselves as victims.

257
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,295
To keep you afraid and helpless.

258
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:51,468
Turns out we weren't so helpless.
We did get rid of you.

259
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:58,559
Leaving was a political decision, Major.
I've enjoyed reminiscing with you.

260
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,145
Now I think it's time
you let me out of here.

261
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,646
KIRA: I can't do that.

262
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,441
Oh, no, no, no, no, of course not.

263
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,901
No, you see, you're the one
who's lying now, Major.

264
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,779
It's not the truth you're interested in.
All you want is vengeance.

265
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:29,298
<i>Commander, I was led to believe</i>
<i>the Federation guarantees</i>

266
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,134
<i>the safe and unrestricted passage </i>
<i>of all travelers</i>

267
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,261
<i>visiting your station.</i>

268
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,430
-That's correct.
<i>-Then, how do you explain</i>

269
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,849
<i>the detention of a Cardassian citizen?</i>

270
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,727
Marritza came here seeking
medical attention.

271
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,645
Right now, he's under our doctor's care.

272
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,899
All we're trying
to do is to verify his identity.

273
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,526
A simple matter, if you'll give us
some assistance.

274
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,697
<i>I assure you, Commander,</i>
<i>you don't need our assistance.</i>

275
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:59,244
<i>If this patient says his name is Marritza</i>
<i>then that's who he is.</i>

276
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,372
<i>I hope you're not suggesting</i>
<i>you don't trust him</i>

277
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,500
<i>simply because he's Cardassian.</i>

278
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,668
I don't trust him
because he's already lied

279
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,878
about being at Gallitep.

280
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,881
<i>Is that what you're charging</i>
<i>him with, Commander?</i>

281
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:12,758
<i>Lying?</i>

282
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,427
So far, we haven't charged him
with anything.

283
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,096
<i>Then let him go.</i>

284
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,555
I'd like nothing better.

285
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,183
But first, I need to know
who it is I'm letting go.

286
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:27,481
<i>I do appreciate the awkwardness </i>
<i>of your position here, Commander.</i>

287
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:33,904
<i>This Bajoran obsession</i>
<i>with alleged Cardassian improprieties</i>

288
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:38,242
<i>during the occupation</i>
<i>is really quite distasteful.</i>

289
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:41,537
I suppose, if you're a Bajoran,
so was the occupation.

290
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:45,207
<i>I might remind you</i>
<i>that neither one</i> <i>of us is Bajoran</i>

291
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,502
<i>and I would hate their bitterness</i>

292
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:52,673
<i>to cause conflict between</i>
<i>Cardassia and the Federation.</i>

293
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,552
I hope to avoid that, too with your help.

294
00:18:56,718 --> 00:19:02,141
<i>You don't need my help to safeguard </i>
<i>one Cardassian citizen on your station.</i>

295
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,937
<i>If any of these Bajoran hate mongers </i>
<i>get their hands on him</i>

296
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,483
<i>I'll hold you personally responsible.</i>

297
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,043
What are you looking for?

298
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,714
Answers.

299
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,632
Found any yet?

300
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:41,555
Marritza says I don't care
about the truth.

301
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:46,810
-That all I want is vengeance.
-Are you worried that maybe he's right?

302
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,899
All I want is to see him punished.

303
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,695
Even if he is just a file clerk?

304
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,907
That's just it.
I don't want him to be just a file clerk.

305
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:04,494
I want him to be...
I don't know... something worse.

306
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,498
You want him to be guilty.

307
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,544
As far as I'm concerned
if he was at Gallitep, he is guilty.

308
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:13,879
They're all guilty.

309
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:20,260
His punishment will let Bajor feel some...

310
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,596
Satisfaction.

311
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:29,102
It sounds like you're trying too hard
to believe what you're saying

312
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,523
You already know
if you punish him without reason

313
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:37,319
it won't mean anything.
And you already know vengeance...

314
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,571
Isn't enough.

315
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:02,010
Reroute the signal enhancement module
to the main sensor array.

316
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,220
Aye, sir.

317
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,101
How's it look?

318
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:12,688
Just give me a second.
I'll run a diagnostic.

319
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:19,278
I've checked with the Bajoran Archives
and they do have a Marritza on record

320
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,405
as being a filing clerk at Gallitep.

321
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,574
I've also checked with the military
academy on Kora II.

322
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,786
Marritza has been teaching filing there
just as he claims.

323
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,288
O'BRIEN: All set, Commander.

324
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,082
Major, how many images were sent
from the Bajoran archives?

325
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,417
Only one.

326
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,918
It's the only picture
they could find of Gallitep

327
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,128
that had Marritza in it.

328
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,797
The Cardassians destroyed
almost all records of the occupation.

329
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,300
The image enhancement
and transformation functions

330
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,260
are patched directly into your console.

331
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:47,764
Major, what if this image confirms
that Marritza was a file clerk?

332
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,850
What do you expect us to do then?

333
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:54,646
-I suppose you'll let him go.
-I'm glad we understand each other.

334
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,773
-DAX: I've got it.
-On screen.

335
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,484
SISKO: Which one is Marritza?

336
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,528
DAX: Let's see... according to the caption

337
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,197
he's the one in the background
in the far right.

338
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,657
Isolate and magnify.

339
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,996
You're going
to have to do better than that.

340
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,123
Give me a minute.

341
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,875
I'm running an image
enhancement sequence.

342
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,173
It's not him.

343
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:24,176
Are you sure
we're looking at the right man?

344
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:27,554
Background, far right, Aamin Marritza.

345
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,972
It can't be.

346
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,517
If that's Marritza,
then who are we holding here?

347
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:41,109
Lieutenant, isolate the Cardassians
in the foreground.

348
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,822
SISKO: The one in profile on the left
what can you give us?

349
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,375
That's him. That's Marritza.

350
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,670
-Not according to the caption.
-What do you mean?

351
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,590
According to this, it's Gul Darhe'el.

352
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:11,807
Let me guess.

353
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,392
You've come back to learn the secret
of my filing system.

354
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,062
I know all your secrets now.

355
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,564
-Is that so?
-What did you do?

356
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,567
Did you kill the real Marritza
so you could take his place?

357
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:28,740
Well, you'll pay for that death
and all the others you're responsible for.

358
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,159
Oh, I don't think I could pay
for all of them, Major

359
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,829
there were so many
and you can only execute me once.

360
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,498
That's my only regret.

361
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:42,337
But... I'll settle for knowing that Bajor
will finally have the satisfaction

362
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,297
of punishing the Butcher of Gallitep.

363
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:49,177
Tell me, Major.
Did you figure this out all by yourself?

364
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,556
Or did you have help
from your Federation masters?

365
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:57,102
I'll let you wonder about that.
It'll keep you occupied

366
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,728
while we're waiting
for the provisional government

367
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,814
to prepare your war crimes tribunal.

368
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,023
War crimes?

369
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,944
How could there be war crimes
when there hasn't been a war?

370
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:10,157
I can understand your wish
that there had been a war.

371
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,868
Your need to indulge some pathetic fantasy

372
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,829
about brave Bajoran soldiers
marching to honorable defeat.

373
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:19,416
But, in fact, Major
you and I know there was no war, no glory.

374
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,126
Bajor didn't resist.

375
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,129
It surrendered.

376
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,965
The Bajorans were a peaceful
people before you came.

377
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,592
We offered no threat to you.

378
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,219
We could never understand
why you had to be so brutal.

379
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,389
Well, we can't have that, Major.
I want no more secrets between us.

380
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:35,974
Anything you don't understand
I'll explain to you.

381
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,560
Thank you, but I think I've heard enough
of your lies.

382
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:39,519
What lies?

383
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,897
You mean my failure
to divulge my true identity?

384
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,065
Believe me, Major I yearned to tell you

385
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,359
but I knew how much more
satisfaction you would have

386
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,945
if you found out for yourself.
And that was my only deception.

387
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:53,408
Marritza was a magnificent file clerk
and I, Gul Darhe'el

388
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:56,077
I hope you'll not think it immodest
of me to say so,

389
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,163
but I was a magnificent leader.

390
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,582
Oh, you never saw Gallitep at its height.

391
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,753
For a labor camp it was the very model
of order and efficiency.

392
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:05,879
And why?

393
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:09,007
For that,
you have to look to the top. To me!

394
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,551
My word, my every glance was law

395
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:14,095
and the verdict was always
the same, guilty.

396
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,513
You're insane.

397
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,140
Oh, no, no, Major.

398
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:21,811
You can't dismiss me that easily.
I did what had to be done.

399
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,397
My men understood that,
and that's why they loved me.

400
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:27,359
I would order them to go out
and kill Bajoran scum

401
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,819
and they'd do it, they'd murder them

402
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:33,448
and they'd come back covered
in blood, but they felt clean.

403
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,326
Now, why did they feel
that way, Major?

404
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:40,288
-Because they were clean.
-You admit your atrocities.

405
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:42,374
I admit everything.

406
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,920
Why not? I was the best at what I did.
My accomplishments speak for themselves.

407
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,421
Can you say the same?

408
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,508
You and that little Shakaar
resistance cell

409
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:54,552
that you belonged to.
All you did was annoy Cardassians

410
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,554
while I was out exterminating Bajorans.

411
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,723
Make sure you tell that to the tribunal.

412
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,726
-Oh, I will.
-Then they'll sentence you to death.

413
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,852
Let them.

414
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,896
Don't you see, it doesn't change anything?

415
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:09,484
Kill me, torture me it doesn't matter.
You've already lost, Major.

416
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,444
You can never undo what I've accomplished.

417
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,071
The dead will still be dead.

418
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:19,828
What will you do now, Major?
Withhold my medicine?

419
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,351
Here. This will help.

420
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,771
-What is it?
-Maraltian <i>seev-ale</i>

421
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,523
from Quark's private stock.

422
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,070
Better?

423
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,240
You know, Odo

424
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:00,910
I wonder how many others like Darhe'el
are still out there...

425
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,288
Still free, unpunished.

426
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,665
Quite a few, no doubt

427
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,461
but thanks to you,
there's one less out there now.

428
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:11,629
You should have heard him.

429
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:18,428
He bragged about what happened at Gallitep
the torture, the murders, the humiliation.

430
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,764
He's proud about what he did to us.

431
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:25,143
Why don't you go to your quarters
and lie down for a while?

432
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:29,064
We'll leave him alone
with his Cardassian pride.

433
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,732
I don't want to lie down.

434
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:34,944
No, that's what he'd like another Bajoran
hiding in a corner.

435
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,448
He's probably in there laughing
at me right now.

436
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,492
He won't be laughing very long.

437
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:42,702
I hate him, Odo.

438
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:47,123
I hate his smirking,
superior Cardassian face.

439
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:52,962
When I was fighting with the resistance
we used to lie awake at night

440
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,465
plotting the assassination
of men like Darhe'el.

441
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,425
Now I have to stand there
and listen to him

442
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,053
belittle the Shakaar
and everything it stood for.

443
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:04,057
Perhaps you should avoid
discussing your personal history

444
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,266
with a creature like that.

445
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,018
I didn't.

446
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,816
Then how did he know
you were with the Shakaar?

447
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,238
I don't know...
he was an important military leader.

448
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:20,949
That doesn't explain it.

449
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:25,620
If he'd been in charge
of quelling Bajoran resistance

450
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:30,291
then he might have had your name on file
but he commanded a forced labor camp.

451
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,877
Something's not right here.

452
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,049
Where are you going?

453
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,719
To have another little chat
with Gul Darhe'el.

454
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:52,814
Computer, review all off-station requests
for information regarding Major Kira Nerys

455
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,649
within the last eight months.

456
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,942
COMPUTER: <i>Working.</i>

457
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,655
Oh, back to see the Butcher.
Am I really so fascinating?

458
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,657
How did you know I was with the Shakaar?

459
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,492
( chuckling )

460
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:08,371
This provisional government of yours
certainly moves slowly.

461
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,623
They should have dragged me
away in chains by now.

462
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,791
KIRA: Just answer the question!

463
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,836
Oh, my, my, you are a strutting
little egotist.

464
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,798
You forget the brilliance
of Marritza's filing system.

465
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,426
He made sure that I was provided
with information

466
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,219
on all your little terrorist bands.

467
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,389
What I particularly enjoyed
were the termination reports.

468
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:27,974
( chuckling )

469
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,644
Yes, life in a forced labor camp
can be so isolating.

470
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,772
At times, I felt that I alone

471
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,399
bore the burden of cleansing
Bajor of its rabble

472
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:39,819
but those reports reassured me,
I was not alone.

473
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,156
And I'm supposed to believe
you remembered my name

474
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,533
from some report you read years ago?

475
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,455
At the risk of bruising
your vanity even further, Major

476
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,958
I didn't remember you at all
until I heard your name here.

477
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,627
I can see that disturbs you.

478
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:56,628
Hardly.

479
00:29:57,003 --> 00:30:00,089
You know, Major,
they will be coming for me soon

480
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,091
so before we say good-bye

481
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:05,136
there are a few little questions
I should like to ask you.

482
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:09,557
-Your questions don't interest me.
-How can you be so sure?

483
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,851
Or are you just afraid to hear them?

484
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,002
Who are they?

485
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:42,674
Survivors of Gallitep.
They arrived early this morning.

486
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,468
I suppose they are waiting for justice.

487
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,386
Gallitep.

488
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,305
Imagine living through that hellhole.

489
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:53,017
The pain... the sorrow...

490
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,187
Do you think they like to gamble?

491
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:10,159
-Doctor, I need your help.
-Of course.

492
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,496
Three months ago
a request came from Kora II

493
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,915
for information concerning Kira Nerys.

494
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,126
-To what purpose?
-I'm not sure.

495
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:22,088
But the name on the request
was Aamin Marritza.

496
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:26,092
I've established a subspace link
with Kora II

497
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,177
and I'd like you to access
his medical history there.

498
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,013
<i>Dax to Odo.</i>

499
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,640
<i>Gul Dukat is responding</i>
<i>to your subspace transmission.</i>

500
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,684
Could you route it to my office?

501
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:35,685
<i>Aye, sir.</i>

502
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:44,485
<i>I do miss working with you, Odo.</i>
<i>I miss our games of Kalevian montar.</i>

503
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:47,697
As I recall, Gul Dukat, we played one game

504
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,907
and you cheated.

505
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,868
( chuckling )

506
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:57,832
<i>The same old Odo like a blunt instrument.</i>

507
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,251
<i>But now to your question.</i>

508
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:04,797
<i>I regret that I cannot give you</i>
<i>access to any of the files</i>

509
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,799
<i>pertaining to Gul Darhe'el.</i>

510
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,927
<i>But I assure you,</i>

511
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,055
<i>the files would only tell you</i>
<i>what I am telling you.</i>

512
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:15,058
<i>Gul Darhe'el is dead.</i>

513
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:17,852
That's not possible.

514
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:23,900
<i>I attended his funeral myself.</i>
<i>As a matter of fact, he's buried</i>

515
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,570
<i>under one of the largest</i>
<i>military monuments on Cardassia.</i>

516
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,615
Then who are we holding here?

517
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:36,120
<i>Some innocent Cardassian citizen</i>
<i>as I explained to your Commander Sisko.</i>

518
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:41,209
<i>-And we want him released.</i>
-That innocent citizen

519
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,878
has admitted he is Gul Darhe'el.

520
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,508
<i>What... are you saying?</i>

521
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:53,680
He says his name is Gul Darhe'el.

522
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,598
<i>Then he's lying.</i>

523
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,434
Well, if he is, it's the most foolish lie
he could have invented.

524
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:01,521
It's likely to get him executed.
Why would anyone do such a thing?

525
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:02,730
<i>I don't know</i>

526
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:06,859
<i>but I tell you I attended </i>
<i>Darhe'el's funeral.</i>

527
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:10,947
You're sure the man
you saw buried was Gul Darhe'el?

528
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,825
<i>Half of Cardassia viewed his body.</i>

529
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:18,329
I saw a photograph of Gul Darhe'el
taken at the Gallitep labor camp.

530
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,581
It certainly appears
to be the man we're holding.

531
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,501
<i>-You're mistaken.</i>
-Am I?

532
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:27,672
<i>This is obviously some plot</i>
<i>to embarrass the Cardassian Empire.</i>

533
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,383
It's possible.

534
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:35,054
Give me access to your files
and perhaps I can find some proof

535
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:38,349
to support your claim
that Gul Darhe'el is dead.

536
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,018
( sighs )

537
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:47,483
I suppose I could grant you
limited access to the files.

538
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,821
I think that's wise.

539
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,037
I was 12 when I started fighting

540
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,205
but I've heard of some
who were even younger than that.

541
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:04,125
Yes, yes, let's get to the real issue!

542
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,045
How many Cardassians did you kill?

543
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,755
I mean personally.

544
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:13,217
-I didn't keep count.
-Oh, I think you did.

545
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:16,888
And I'm sure your total wasn't limited
to military personnel.

546
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:21,184
After all, the most effective
terrorist weapon was random violence.

547
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,853
Don't leave now, Major.
It's just getting good.

548
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,522
How many Cardassian
civilians did you kill?

549
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:29,400
Look! I regret a lot of what I had to do.

550
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,693
MARITZZA: How convenient of you.

551
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,279
We had no choice!
We were fighting for survival.

552
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,324
So were we. We had an Empire to protect.

553
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:41,412
We needed your resources. Everything I did
was for the greater glory of Cardassia!

554
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:46,167
And if you spineless scum
had to be ground under so much the better.

555
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,253
All that mattered was Cardassia.
I loved my homeland.

556
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:52,799
That's what justified my actions.
That's what gave me strength.

557
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,968
Nothing justifies genocide.

558
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,931
What you call genocide,
I call a day's work.

559
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,895
Major, could I have a word with you?

560
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,410
Dr. Bashir and I have done some checking.

561
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,663
I don't know why yet

562
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:27,667
but the man in that cell
wanted to be caught.

563
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:45,643
This certificate of death
was in the file sent to me by Gul Dukat.

564
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:49,647
According to this, Gul Darhe'el
died in his sleep six years ago.

565
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,316
"Cause of death,
massive coleibric hemorrhage."

566
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,444
Commander, I guarantee you
that is a forged document.

567
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,655
I think it's pretty clear
what's going on here.

568
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:00,825
The Cardassians are trying to trick us
into letting him go.

569
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,494
I wouldn't put it past
our friend Gul Dukat.

570
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,663
Nor would I, however...

571
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,416
The man in there confessed
he is Gul Darhe'el.

572
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:12,003
Major, the man
in there has Kalla-Nohra syndrome.

573
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:13,838
Of course he does.

574
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,132
According to the evidence I've been sent

575
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,302
Gul Darhe'el never contracted
that condition.

576
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,388
More evidence
from our trustworthy Gul Dukat.

577
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,684
What have you got, Constable?

578
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,395
Darhe'el's progress reports from Gallitep

579
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,898
show that,
when the mining accident occurred

580
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,733
he was back on Cardassia

581
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:36,277
being awarded the Proficient
Service Medallion.

582
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,614
If he wasn't at Gallitep
on the day on the accident

583
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,074
then he couldn't have
contracted Kalla-Nohra.

584
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,367
Correct.

585
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,787
But the man we're holding does have it.

586
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,373
I can't believe I'm listening to this.

587
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,417
I'm afraid there's more, Major.

588
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:55,546
I inquired about
this man's last two weeks on Kora II.

589
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,299
He resigned his position
at the military academy

590
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,967
put all his affairs in order

591
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,595
and even provided handsomely
for his housekeeper

592
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:03,638
I understand.

593
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,097
All right, all right.

594
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,725
So, like any criminal,
he wanted to move on

595
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,644
before somebody traced his whereabouts.

596
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,271
He specifically requested passage

597
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:16,317
on a vessel that was scheduled
to stop here at a Bajoran station.

598
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,904
Rather unusual request
for a Cardassian war criminal.

599
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,157
SISKO: Unless he wanted to be captured.

600
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:27,536
Wait a minute.
Let's be clear about one thing.

601
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,956
This evidence may raise
some interesting questions.

602
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:33,876
Nevertheless, Darhe'el is going
to be sent back to Bajor

603
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,504
to stand trial
for the atrocities he committed.

604
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,589
Major, that is still to be determined.

605
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,424
Well, then go talk to him.

606
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:44,303
If you still have any doubts,
listen to what he has to say.

607
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,890
He was there. He did it.
He'll tell you about it.

608
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,142
( door opens )

609
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,688
Constable, I've checked
on Marritza's medical record.

610
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,314
What have we got?

611
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,484
He's under treatment
for Kalla-Nohra syndrome, of course,

612
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:01,028
and a few other minor ailments
most relating to his age.

613
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:04,448
It's all pretty standard,
really, except for one thing.

614
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,491
Which is?

615
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:11,455
Five years ago after arriving on Kora II
he started taking massive doses

616
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:15,042
of dermatiraelian plastiscine
which is a dermal regenerative agent

617
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:19,922
used to maintain skin resilience
after cosmetic alteration.

618
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:26,387
You're saying he changed his face
to look like Gul Darhe'el.

619
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,431
It certainly appears that way.

620
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:43,195
How are you feeling?

621
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:47,033
I was starting to get a little bored
but seeing you again brightens my day.

622
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,827
I was referring
to your Kalla-Nohra Syndrome.

623
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,955
Would you like to see Dr. Bashir?

624
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:54,457
Oh, so that's it.

625
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,209
You want to see me writhing
around the floor in pain.

626
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:01,005
A Cardassian would never
put on such a deplorable display

627
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:01,964
in front of a Bajoran.

628
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,591
You just don't understand us at all.

629
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,552
I'm beginning to understand
a great deal about you.

630
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,804
One thing does puzzle me.

631
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:10,348
And what would that be?

632
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,351
How you contracted Kalla-Nohra Syndrome.

633
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:17,271
Do you think that the mining accident
affected only the Bajoran laborers

634
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,023
and not their Cardassian masters?

635
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:20,608
That would be very nice.

636
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:23,903
So you're saying you were at Gallitep
when that mining accident occurred.

637
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,530
Of course.
Why are we going over this again?

638
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,074
Because your own progress report

639
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:31,243
shows you were back on Cardassia
at the time of the accident.

640
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:32,620
That's ridiculous.

641
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,539
Receiving your Proficient
Service Medallion.

642
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,792
-The reports are wrong.
-I can show them to you.

643
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,169
That won't be necessary.
I know where I was.

644
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:43,339
Why were you taking a dermal regenerative?

645
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,592
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Then let me help you.

646
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,678
Five years ago,
when you first got to Kora II--

647
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:50,721
All right, that's enough!

648
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,681
Your presence no longer
amuses me. Get out!

649
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,266
Why did you have your face altered?

650
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,143
Security, get this woman out of here!

651
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,604
Why are you pretending to be Gul Darhe'el?

652
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,856
Why don't you ask me
something intelligent?

653
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:05,152
As for instance, how did I feel
when we were withdrawing from Bajor?

654
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,570
The answer is I was furious.

655
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:08,697
The thought of leaving
any survivors behind

656
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,157
was repulsive to me.

657
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:13,994
So while our useless office clerks
were packing their precious files

658
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:15,746
I ordered my overseers

659
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,416
to begin slaughtering the laborers.

660
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,252
If you felt that way
about your filing clerks

661
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,003
why did you take Marritza's name?

662
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:27,216
My plan was to do nothing less
than kill every Bajoran in the camp

663
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:30,678
and, to this day, my one regret
is that I was not able

664
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,721
to accomplish this honorable goal.

665
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,891
You're Marritza, aren't you?

666
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:40,312
You mistake me for that bug?
That whimpering nothing?

667
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:43,649
Oh, you stupid Bajoran girl.
Don't you know who I am?

668
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,819
I'm your nemesis. I'm your nightmare.

669
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:49,238
I'm the Butcher of Gallitep.

670
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:52,616
The Butcher of Gallitep
died six years ago.

671
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,453
You're Aamin Marritza, his filing clerk.

672
00:40:55,703 --> 00:41:00,124
That's not true. I am alive.
I will always be alive!

673
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,835
It's Marritza who is dead.

674
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,713
Marritza, who was good for nothing

675
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:09,425
but cowering under his bunk
and weeping like a woman.

676
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:15,556
Who, every night, covered his ears
because he couldn't bear to hear

677
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:19,310
the screaming for mercy of the Bajorans.

678
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,521
( weeping )

679
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,370
Covered my ears every night, but...

680
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,832
I couldn't bear to hear
those horrible screams.

681
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,711
You have no idea
what it's like to be a coward...

682
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,923
To see these horrors...

683
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,091
And do nothing.

684
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:54,303
Marritza's dead. He deserves to be dead.

685
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:02,811
What are you doing?

686
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:04,939
I'm letting you go.

687
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,442
( weakly )<i> </i>Security?

688
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,069
Get in here.

689
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:18,494
You didn't commit those crimes
and you couldn't stop them.

690
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,287
You were only one man.

691
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,290
No, no, don't you see?
I have to be punished.

692
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,042
We all have to be punished.

693
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:29,588
Major, you have to go out and tell them
I'm Gul Darhe'el. It's the only way.

694
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,384
Why are you doing this?

695
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,554
For Cardassia. Cardassia will only survive

696
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:39,181
if it stands in front of Bajor
and admits the truth.

697
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:44,061
My trial will force Cardassia
to acknowledge its guilt

698
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:45,854
and we're guilty, all of us.

699
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:48,691
My death is necessary.

700
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:59,076
What you're asking for is another murder.
Enough good people have already died.

701
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,038
I won't help kill another.

702
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:22,474
You should be back on Kora II
in three days.

703
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,227
Well, there's nothing
for me to go back to.

704
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,854
We've contacted officials there.

705
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,480
They'll be waiting to help you.

706
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,234
If they believed that I was Gul Darhe'el

707
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:35,321
then my trial might have helped
to bring about a new Cardassia.

708
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,283
Now you've told them
I was just a file clerk.

709
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:42,036
What you tried to do was very honorable.

710
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,248
If Cardassia is going to change
it's going to need people like you.

711
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,671
( groans )

712
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:02,723
Why?

713
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,683
He wasn't Darhe'el! Why?

714
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:08,228
He's a Cardassian! That's reason enough.

715
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:09,563
No!

716
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,526
It's not.
