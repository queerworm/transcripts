1
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:09,112
We never cared what we did

2
00:00:09,146 --> 00:00:11,515
as long as it annoyed
the grown-ups.

3
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:13,613
All inner deflector
shield subsystems

4
00:00:13,656 --> 00:00:15,250
are showing equal intensity.

5
00:00:15,293 --> 00:00:17,857
Power balance levels
are reading normal.

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,064
I was a champion window breaker.

7
00:00:20,105 --> 00:00:23,807
On a dark night with a few
rocks, I was deadly.

8
00:00:23,847 --> 00:00:27,185
Um, which you are
you talking about?

9
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:31,791
We're being hailed
by an incoming freighter.

10
00:00:31,834 --> 00:00:34,432
Open a channel.

11
00:00:34,473 --> 00:00:35,999
On screen.

12
00:00:36,043 --> 00:00:37,706
Welcome to DS9.

13
00:00:37,748 --> 00:00:38,842
I'm Major Kira Nerys.

14
00:00:38,883 --> 00:00:41,184
This is the Kobheerian Freighter
<i>Rak-Miunis</i>

15
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,919
requesting permission to dock.

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,592
Docking Port 6
is clear for approach.

17
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:46,863
Thank you.

18
00:00:46,903 --> 00:00:50,469
We have a passenger on board
requiring medical assistance.

19
00:00:50,512 --> 00:00:53,144
Can you tell us what's wrong
with your passenger?

20
00:00:53,184 --> 00:00:55,553
He says it's a condition
called Kalla-Nohra.

21
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:57,083
It's apparently chronic

22
00:00:57,127 --> 00:00:59,121
but he doesn't have
his medication.

23
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,034
Beam him directly
to our Infirmary.

24
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,767
We'll have our doctor
standing by.

25
00:01:02,808 --> 00:01:04,539
Thank you, Commander.

26
00:01:04,578 --> 00:01:06,172
<i>Rak-Miunis</i> out.

27
00:01:06,216 --> 00:01:07,344
Dax to Infirmary.

28
00:01:07,385 --> 00:01:09,082
This is Bashir.
Go ahead.

29
00:01:09,123 --> 00:01:11,994
A Kobheerian transport is
about to beam a patient to you.

30
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,003
He's suffering from something
called Kalla-Nohra.

31
00:01:15,037 --> 00:01:16,404
I'm not aware of it.

32
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,638
I'll check the computer.

33
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:23,019
Commander, I'd like to go
down to the Infirmary

34
00:01:23,056 --> 00:01:24,115
and meet that patient.

35
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,560
Of course. Why?

36
00:01:25,596 --> 00:01:28,398
The only cases
of Kalla-Nohra I know of

37
00:01:28,436 --> 00:01:30,498
were the result
of a mining accident

38
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:33,605
at a Bajoran forced labor camp
that I helped liberate.

39
00:01:33,648 --> 00:01:35,242
The survivors of Gallitep

40
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:38,224
have always been a symbol
to us of strength and courage.

41
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:39,751
By all means, Major.

42
00:01:39,797 --> 00:01:42,234
Take as much time as you want.

43
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,803
Ah, Major.

44
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,743
I'll be right with you.

45
00:02:03,654 --> 00:02:04,622
Kira to Odo.

46
00:02:04,656 --> 00:02:05,624
Go ahead.

47
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:06,787
I'm in the Infirmary.

48
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:07,955
I need security here

49
00:02:07,997 --> 00:02:08,965
on the double.

50
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:09,989
I'm on my way, Major.

51
00:04:11,286 --> 00:04:13,257
What's the matter, Major?

52
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,091
Your patient is a criminal.

53
00:04:23,983 --> 00:04:26,615
Good afternoon.

54
00:04:26,657 --> 00:04:29,289
I assume this is the problem.

55
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,424
Problem?

56
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:31,662
Lock him up.

57
00:04:31,702 --> 00:04:33,194
This is outrageous.
On what charge?

58
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,936
Will somebody tell me
what's going on?

59
00:04:34,976 --> 00:04:36,309
This man needs medical care.

60
00:04:36,346 --> 00:04:38,214
Then give it to him
in his cell.

61
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:39,948
I haven't done anything.

62
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,480
Then why did you run?

63
00:04:41,593 --> 00:04:45,090
I'm trying to get away
from this Bajoran fanatic.

64
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:47,072
The look of hate in her eyes...
she'd like to kill me.

65
00:04:47,105 --> 00:04:49,599
Oh? And why would that be?

66
00:04:49,645 --> 00:04:51,946
Well, it's obvious.
I'm a Cardassian.

67
00:04:51,984 --> 00:04:54,513
He's not just any Cardassian.

68
00:04:54,557 --> 00:04:56,551
He's a war criminal.

69
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:06,475
So you're saying this man...
what's his name?

70
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:08,182
Marritza.
Aamin Marritza.

71
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,490
You're saying Marritza's
on the Bajorans' list

72
00:05:10,562 --> 00:05:13,091
for Cardassians wanted
for war crimes?

73
00:05:13,135 --> 00:05:14,764
He's not on any list

74
00:05:14,805 --> 00:05:17,403
I've seen, Commander,
and I've got them all.

75
00:05:17,445 --> 00:05:19,473
I don't care
whether he's listed or not...

76
00:05:19,517 --> 00:05:20,507
Hold on, Major.

77
00:05:20,552 --> 00:05:22,648
Marritza is traveling
on a Federation ship.

78
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:25,185
He comes here
for a medical emergency

79
00:05:25,231 --> 00:05:26,723
and we throw him
into a security cell.

80
00:05:26,767 --> 00:05:27,929
I, for one, hope he's listed.

81
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:30,705
Commander, I know what I've
done isn't exactly policy

82
00:05:30,743 --> 00:05:32,873
and may not even be legal,
but it's right.

83
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,977
All right, Major,
what do we charge him with?

84
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,891
I'm charging him with having
contracted Kalla-Nohra.

85
00:05:37,927 --> 00:05:39,761
Do you want to explain
that to me?

86
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,235
The only way he could have
contracted that condition

87
00:05:42,272 --> 00:05:44,368
was to have served
at the Gallitep labor camp

88
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:46,038
at the time
of the mining accident.

89
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,574
So, that makes him a war
criminal, just being there?

90
00:05:48,619 --> 00:05:51,786
Commander, if you'd been
there 12 years ago

91
00:05:51,827 --> 00:05:54,128
when we liberated that camp...

92
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,730
if you'd seen the things I saw...

93
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:01,079
all those Bajoran bodies,
starved, brutalized...

94
00:06:01,116 --> 00:06:03,748
Do you know
what Cardassian policy was?

95
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,453
Oh, I'm not even talking
about the murder.

96
00:06:05,493 --> 00:06:07,396
Murder was just the end
of the fun for them.

97
00:06:07,432 --> 00:06:08,765
First came the humiliation.

98
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:11,570
Mothers raped in front
of their children

99
00:06:11,609 --> 00:06:13,842
husbands beaten
until their wives

100
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,076
couldn't recognize them

101
00:06:15,116 --> 00:06:18,021
old people buried alive because
they couldn't work anymore.

102
00:06:25,976 --> 00:06:29,074
I think I'll have a talk
with our guest.

103
00:06:29,117 --> 00:06:30,609
I'll come with you.

104
00:06:30,687 --> 00:06:31,746
No, Major.

105
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,253
It'd be better
if I spoke to him alone.

106
00:06:46,024 --> 00:06:47,550
How do you feel?

107
00:06:47,594 --> 00:06:49,394
Better, thank you.

108
00:06:49,432 --> 00:06:51,528
I'm Benjamin Sisko.

109
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,164
I'm in charge of this station.

110
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,507
Oh, finally.

111
00:06:54,545 --> 00:06:56,242
The Federation to the rescue.

112
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:59,278
Are you going to get
me out of here?

113
00:06:59,322 --> 00:07:00,916
I hope so.

114
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,366
Tell me, how did you contract
Kalla-Nohra Syndrome?

115
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:06,565
I don't have Kalla-Nohra.

116
00:07:06,606 --> 00:07:08,269
I have Pottrik Syndrome.

117
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:10,407
The freighter captain said
it was Kalla-Nohra.

118
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:12,009
A very similar condition.

119
00:07:12,053 --> 00:07:15,083
Take the same medication,
as a matter of fact.

120
00:07:15,127 --> 00:07:17,496
Then you didn't serve
at the Gallitep labor camp?

121
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:18,866
Labor camp?

122
00:07:20,205 --> 00:07:21,504
No.

123
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,513
I've never been to Bajor.

124
00:07:23,547 --> 00:07:26,543
I was a military file clerk.

125
00:07:26,587 --> 00:07:31,554
I reside now on Kora II
where I boarded a freighter

126
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,697
which, unfortunately
for me, came here.

127
00:07:34,741 --> 00:07:37,144
Now, Commander, if you have
no more questions

128
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,547
I'd like to be on my way.

129
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,280
Am I still drunk

130
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:44,057
or am I in jail
with a Cardassian?

131
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,497
Odo!

132
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:49,338
You're not keeping me
in here with one of those.

133
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:52,838
Odo! Odo!

134
00:07:52,884 --> 00:07:57,327
I put myself in your hands,
Commander.

135
00:08:05,982 --> 00:08:07,041
Let me get this straight.

136
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:08,953
You're saying
Marritza does have Kalla-Nohra?

137
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,391
There's no doubt about it.

138
00:08:10,426 --> 00:08:11,690
He has all the symptoms.

139
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:14,861
And when I ran a lower pulmonary
bio-probe, he read positive.

140
00:08:14,904 --> 00:08:17,468
And you're sure he doesn't
have Pottrik Syndrome?

141
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,478
Yes, absolutely.

142
00:08:18,512 --> 00:08:19,571
If he had Pottrik's

143
00:08:19,614 --> 00:08:21,208
the bio-probe
would have been negative.

144
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:24,590
Then he was
at the Gallitep labor camp.

145
00:08:24,626 --> 00:08:25,925
Definitely.

146
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,457
I've cross-checked all Bajoran
and Federation medical records

147
00:08:28,503 --> 00:08:29,767
and there's simply no other way

148
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,308
he could have gotten
this condition.

149
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:32,505
Kira to Sisko.

150
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:33,776
Yes, Major?

151
00:08:33,815 --> 00:08:36,379
Commander, there's an incoming
transmission for you from Bajor.

152
00:08:36,422 --> 00:08:38,416
It's the Minister of State.

153
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,194
Thank you.
If you'll excuse me, Doctor.

154
00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:46,642
Minister Kaval.

155
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,978
Good day, sir.

156
00:08:48,016 --> 00:08:49,645
And to you, Commander.

157
00:08:49,687 --> 00:08:50,917
I trust you're in good health.

158
00:08:50,956 --> 00:08:52,448
Things are going well
on the station?

159
00:08:52,493 --> 00:08:53,518
Quite well, thank you.

160
00:08:53,563 --> 00:08:54,759
That's wonderful.

161
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,564
I'm told you've performed

162
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,767
a special service
for Bajor today.

163
00:08:58,808 --> 00:09:00,334
Congratulations to you.

164
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:02,008
I don't quite follow.

165
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,456
You're not holding
a certain Cardassian for us?

166
00:09:05,492 --> 00:09:08,465
We are holding a Cardassian
temporarily.

167
00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:11,495
By temporarily, you mean
until you are satisfied

168
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:14,010
that a verified identification
has been made.

169
00:09:14,046 --> 00:09:16,017
Minister, I'm not sure
we have the grounds

170
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,109
to hold him that long.

171
00:09:17,153 --> 00:09:19,785
I fully understand
your concerns, Commander

172
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,125
but since our Major Kira

173
00:09:21,163 --> 00:09:23,464
has accepted responsibility
in this matter

174
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:25,266
the burden
is off your shoulders.

175
00:09:25,305 --> 00:09:26,295
I don't agree.

176
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:27,366
Commander

177
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,711
if this Marritza was at Gallitep

178
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,244
we want him,
and we will have him.

179
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:33,588
Is that clear?

180
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,687
It is.

181
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,701
Good.

182
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:39,763
We'll chat again soon.

183
00:09:39,807 --> 00:09:41,470
Good day, Commander.

184
00:10:01,776 --> 00:10:03,405
May I join you?

185
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:05,248
Actually, I was just about

186
00:10:05,285 --> 00:10:07,756
to pay a visit to our friend,
Marritza.

187
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,423
That's what I want
to talk to you about, Major.

188
00:10:10,464 --> 00:10:13,301
I'd like Odo to handle
this investigation.

189
00:10:13,337 --> 00:10:15,308
Why?

190
00:10:15,376 --> 00:10:17,506
He's our Chief of Security.

191
00:10:17,548 --> 00:10:20,646
Minister Kaval put me in charge.

192
00:10:20,689 --> 00:10:23,253
Minister Kaval
doesn't run this station.

193
00:10:23,295 --> 00:10:24,628
And the Federation has no right

194
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,294
telling us how to deal
with our criminals.

195
00:10:26,336 --> 00:10:28,466
If it turns out
that he is a criminal

196
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:31,242
then he'll be yours,
and you're welcome to him.

197
00:10:31,281 --> 00:10:34,220
Until then, he's just a traveler
under suspicion.

198
00:10:39,099 --> 00:10:40,466
You think this is all

199
00:10:40,502 --> 00:10:43,373
some personal vendetta
on my part, don't you?

200
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:46,713
I think you're too close
to be objective, yes.

201
00:10:46,751 --> 00:10:49,747
You're right.
I'm not objective.

202
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:54,393
But I'm your First Officer,
and I give you my word

203
00:10:54,503 --> 00:10:57,101
I will conduct myself
accordingly.

204
00:11:00,985 --> 00:11:03,286
You once said we were friends.

205
00:11:03,324 --> 00:11:07,630
I'm asking you now,
as a friend...

206
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:12,635
please, let me conduct
this investigation.

207
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,742
I owe it to them.

208
00:11:14,785 --> 00:11:17,917
You mean the victims.

209
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:19,930
That's right.

210
00:11:19,964 --> 00:11:24,464
The ones who moved too slowly
and never moved again.

211
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,947
I'm asking for all the Bajorans
who can't ask.

212
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:35,364
Let a Bajoran do this.

213
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:44,990
Sisko to Odo.

214
00:11:45,024 --> 00:11:46,459
Go ahead.

215
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:49,467
Constable, Major Kira

216
00:11:49,535 --> 00:11:53,169
will be in charge
of the Marritza investigation.

217
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,873
I understand.

218
00:11:58,991 --> 00:12:00,483
Thank you.

219
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:14,661
Constable.

220
00:12:14,695 --> 00:12:16,666
It's about time you let me out.

221
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,334
Try to stay out of trouble
for a day or two, will you?

222
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,175
I'll do my best.

223
00:12:22,214 --> 00:12:27,557
Oh, and Odo, let me know
when you hang the Cardassian.

224
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:33,703
I've begun a background check
on Marritza.

225
00:12:33,741 --> 00:12:35,871
So far he is what he says he is.

226
00:12:35,913 --> 00:12:39,045
He boarded that Kobheerian
freighter at Kora II

227
00:12:39,087 --> 00:12:41,388
where he's worked
as an instructor

228
00:12:41,426 --> 00:12:44,399
at a military academy
for the past five years.

229
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:46,062
Keep looking.

230
00:12:46,104 --> 00:12:48,804
Don't worry, Major, I intend to.

231
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:52,280
I'll be with the prisoner
if you need me.

232
00:12:57,197 --> 00:13:00,329
My compliments
on your replicators, Major.

233
00:13:00,371 --> 00:13:05,509
But the <i>sem'hal</i> stew
could use a little <i>yamok</i> sauce.

234
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,144
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

235
00:13:07,188 --> 00:13:08,521
I doubt that, Major.

236
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:10,185
I doubt it very much.

237
00:13:10,228 --> 00:13:12,461
I hope it won't disturb
your dinner

238
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,403
if I ask you a few questions.

239
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:15,840
If I refuse to answer?

240
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,276
I'll ask them anyway.

241
00:13:17,312 --> 00:13:19,910
Of course.

242
00:13:19,951 --> 00:13:21,888
This is my job.

243
00:13:21,923 --> 00:13:25,295
Persecuting Cardassians goes
far beyond your job, Major.

244
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:26,664
It's your passion.

245
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,945
You claim you were never
at Gallitep.

246
00:13:32,983 --> 00:13:34,954
I missed that honor.

247
00:13:34,987 --> 00:13:38,017
And that your illness
is not Kalla-Nohra.

248
00:13:38,062 --> 00:13:39,326
Again, true.

249
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:40,595
Again, false.

250
00:13:40,701 --> 00:13:43,833
Our Doctor confirmed
you do have Kalla-Nohra

251
00:13:43,876 --> 00:13:46,313
which means
you were at Gallitep.

252
00:13:46,348 --> 00:13:49,321
If your lies are going to be
this transparent

253
00:13:49,355 --> 00:13:52,328
it's going to be
a very short interrogation.

254
00:13:52,363 --> 00:13:56,829
Well, in that case, I'll try
to make my lies more opaque.

255
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,910
What was your rank at Gallitep?

256
00:14:01,952 --> 00:14:03,421
What were your duties?

257
00:14:03,456 --> 00:14:04,857
You don't want to know.

258
00:14:04,892 --> 00:14:06,293
Just answer the question.

259
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:07,821
You'll be disappointed.

260
00:14:09,804 --> 00:14:11,296
I'll risk it.

261
00:14:13,046 --> 00:14:15,347
I had the distinction of serving

262
00:14:15,384 --> 00:14:18,357
in the exalted position
of filing clerk.

263
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:20,419
Filing clerk?

264
00:14:20,463 --> 00:14:22,627
I told you
you'd be disappointed.

265
00:14:22,702 --> 00:14:24,764
Actually, I would have preferred

266
00:14:24,807 --> 00:14:26,641
to avoid military service
altogether

267
00:14:26,678 --> 00:14:28,740
but I had the good fortune
to be posted

268
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,276
to the records office
at Gallitep

269
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,814
and I turned out to be
an exemplary file clerk.

270
00:14:32,859 --> 00:14:34,351
In 14 units of service

271
00:14:34,396 --> 00:14:36,663
I never misplaced
or lost a record.

272
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:38,831
I received
numerous commendations.

273
00:14:38,874 --> 00:14:41,574
Gul Darhe'el, himself, called
my computer filing system

274
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,815
"a masterpiece
of meticulous exactitude."

275
00:14:44,855 --> 00:14:46,484
Well, there you are.

276
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:47,824
My secret's out.

277
00:14:47,862 --> 00:14:50,664
My crimes laid bare.

278
00:14:50,702 --> 00:14:53,196
I await execution.

279
00:14:53,242 --> 00:14:55,713
I hope we don't
keep you waiting long.

280
00:15:00,693 --> 00:15:03,325
You know, I never heard
of a filing clerk

281
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:06,339
becoming an instructor
at a military academy.

282
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:07,501
Until now.

283
00:15:07,543 --> 00:15:08,842
What did you teach?

284
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,783
Believe it or not, filing.

285
00:15:10,817 --> 00:15:12,286
I can verify that.

286
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,619
Be my guest.

287
00:15:13,657 --> 00:15:16,425
I still think you're a liar.

288
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,466
So much for our search
for the truth.

289
00:15:20,507 --> 00:15:22,067
Now we trade insults.

290
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:25,847
You admit
you worked under Gul Darhe'el.

291
00:15:25,886 --> 00:15:27,720
We all did.

292
00:15:27,824 --> 00:15:30,295
I take it, then,
you witnessed the atrocities.

293
00:15:30,331 --> 00:15:31,891
Atrocities?

294
00:15:31,935 --> 00:15:33,929
What atrocities?

295
00:15:35,576 --> 00:15:41,045
Oh, I vaguely recall hearing
a scream from time to time.

296
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,756
Atrocities? No.

297
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,767
You expect me to believe

298
00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:49,331
you knew nothing of the murders,
the tortures?

299
00:15:49,376 --> 00:15:51,347
You never saw the bodies?

300
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:52,907
Of course I saw bodies.

301
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:54,614
People died all the time
at Gallitep...

302
00:15:54,656 --> 00:15:57,892
mining accidents, illnesses,
feuds among the workers.

303
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,097
You're saying
Bajorans killed each other?

304
00:16:01,138 --> 00:16:02,607
At times.

305
00:16:02,641 --> 00:16:05,911
Over food, a blanket, a woman.

306
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:08,420
The conditions were harsh.

307
00:16:08,455 --> 00:16:10,926
It was a labor camp, Major.

308
00:16:10,961 --> 00:16:13,432
I helped liberate that camp.

309
00:16:13,467 --> 00:16:15,267
I saw the bodies.

310
00:16:15,305 --> 00:16:17,139
I know how they died.

311
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,409
You saw
what we wanted you to see.

312
00:16:19,448 --> 00:16:21,248
Who do you think
started the rumors

313
00:16:21,286 --> 00:16:22,778
about brutality at Gallitep?

314
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,884
It was Gul Darhe'el himself.

315
00:16:24,928 --> 00:16:26,261
Now, there was a leader.

316
00:16:26,298 --> 00:16:28,269
Brilliant, extraordinary man.

317
00:16:28,303 --> 00:16:31,276
He knew that to rule by fear
was to rule completely.

318
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,804
Why bother
with actual mass murders

319
00:16:33,849 --> 00:16:36,720
when just the reports
of such incidents

320
00:16:36,757 --> 00:16:38,785
would have the same effect?

321
00:16:38,828 --> 00:16:39,956
Which was?

322
00:16:39,997 --> 00:16:41,626
You know as well as I do, Major.

323
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,539
To keep you Bajorans thinking
of yourselves as victims.

324
00:16:44,575 --> 00:16:46,340
To keep you afraid and helpless.

325
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:50,481
Turns out
we weren't so helpless.

326
00:16:50,523 --> 00:16:52,494
We did get rid of you.

327
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:56,401
Leaving was
a political decision, Major.

328
00:16:56,437 --> 00:16:58,670
I've enjoyed
reminiscing with you.

329
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:02,013
Now I think it's time
you let me out of here.

330
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,519
I can't do that.

331
00:17:03,554 --> 00:17:05,457
Oh, no, no, no, no,
of course not.

332
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:08,465
No, you see, you're the one
who's lying now, Major.

333
00:17:08,499 --> 00:17:10,766
It's not the truth
you're interested in.

334
00:17:10,804 --> 00:17:12,364
All you want is vengeance.

335
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:29,599
Commander, I was led to believe
the Federation guarantees

336
00:17:29,636 --> 00:17:32,940
the safe and unrestricted
passage of all travelers

337
00:17:32,978 --> 00:17:34,277
visiting your station.

338
00:17:34,381 --> 00:17:35,406
That's correct.

339
00:17:35,451 --> 00:17:36,681
Then, how do you explain

340
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,284
the detention
of a Cardassian citizen?

341
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:42,298
Marritza came here seeking
medical attention.

342
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,200
Right now, he's
under our Doctor's care.

343
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:46,710
All we're trying to do
is to verify his identity.

344
00:17:46,744 --> 00:17:50,207
A simple matter... if you'll
give us some assistance.

345
00:17:50,253 --> 00:17:54,160
I assure you, Commander,
you don't need our assistance.

346
00:17:54,196 --> 00:17:57,967
If this patient says
his name is Marritza

347
00:17:58,005 --> 00:17:59,976
then that's who he is.

348
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,710
I hope you're not suggesting
you don't trust him

349
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,948
simply because he's Cardassian.

350
00:18:04,988 --> 00:18:07,084
I don't trust him
because he's already lied

351
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,289
about being at Gallitep.

352
00:18:08,363 --> 00:18:11,895
Is that what you're charging him
with, Commander?

353
00:18:11,939 --> 00:18:13,238
Lying?

354
00:18:13,274 --> 00:18:16,111
So far, we haven't charged him
with anything.

355
00:18:16,148 --> 00:18:17,447
Then let him go.

356
00:18:17,484 --> 00:18:19,113
I'd like nothing better.

357
00:18:19,156 --> 00:18:21,890
But first, I need to know
who it is I'm letting go.

358
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:24,230
I do appreciate

359
00:18:24,268 --> 00:18:27,970
the awkwardness of your position
here, Commander.

360
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,847
This Bajoran obsession

361
00:18:30,883 --> 00:18:34,449
with alleged
Cardassian improprieties

362
00:18:34,492 --> 00:18:38,958
during the occupation
is really quite distasteful.

363
00:18:39,003 --> 00:18:42,101
I suppose, if you're a Bajoran,
so was the occupation.

364
00:18:42,144 --> 00:18:43,613
I might remind you

365
00:18:43,648 --> 00:18:46,177
that neither one
of us is Bajoran

366
00:18:46,221 --> 00:18:49,023
and I would hate
their bitterness

367
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:53,366
to cause conflict between
Cardassia and the Federation.

368
00:18:53,405 --> 00:18:57,141
I hope to avoid that, too...
with your help.

369
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,740
You don't need my help

370
00:18:58,784 --> 00:19:03,022
to safeguard one Cardassian
citizen on your station.

371
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:05,898
If any of these
Bajoran hate mongers

372
00:19:05,934 --> 00:19:08,566
get their hands on him

373
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:12,640
I'll hold you
personally responsible.

374
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:30,953
What are you looking for?

375
00:19:32,966 --> 00:19:34,435
Answers.

376
00:19:34,469 --> 00:19:36,633
Found any yet?

377
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:42,150
Marritza says I don't care
about the truth.

378
00:19:42,188 --> 00:19:44,820
That all I want is vengeance.

379
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,825
Are you worried
that maybe he's right?

380
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:53,837
All I want
is to see him punished.

381
00:19:53,882 --> 00:19:57,345
Even if he is just a file clerk?

382
00:19:57,391 --> 00:19:58,485
That's just it.

383
00:19:58,561 --> 00:20:01,193
I don't want him
to be just a file clerk.

384
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,395
I want him to be...

385
00:20:02,436 --> 00:20:04,532
I don't know...
something worse.

386
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,511
You want him to be guilty.

387
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:11,216
As far as I'm concerned

388
00:20:11,257 --> 00:20:13,728
if he was at Gallitep,
he is guilty.

389
00:20:13,763 --> 00:20:15,392
They're all guilty.

390
00:20:15,434 --> 00:20:22,076
His punishment
will let Bajor feel some...

391
00:20:22,117 --> 00:20:24,919
satisfaction.

392
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,930
It sounds like
you're trying too hard

393
00:20:27,964 --> 00:20:30,435
to believe what you're saying.

394
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:34,104
You already know,
if you punish him without reason

395
00:20:34,145 --> 00:20:35,774
it won't mean anything.

396
00:20:35,816 --> 00:20:39,382
And you already know
vengeance...

397
00:20:39,425 --> 00:20:41,259
isn't enough.

398
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:01,342
Reroute the signal
enhancement module

399
00:21:01,377 --> 00:21:03,006
to the main sensor array.

400
00:21:03,048 --> 00:21:04,540
Aye, sir.

401
00:21:08,662 --> 00:21:10,291
How's it look?

402
00:21:10,332 --> 00:21:11,961
Just give me a second.

403
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:13,997
I'll run a diagnostic.

404
00:21:16,113 --> 00:21:18,414
I've checked
with the Bajoran Archives

405
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:20,581
and they do have
a Marritza on record

406
00:21:20,623 --> 00:21:22,924
as being a filing clerk
at Gallitep.

407
00:21:22,963 --> 00:21:25,264
I've also checked with the
military academy on Kora II.

408
00:21:25,301 --> 00:21:27,602
Marritza has been
teaching filing there

409
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,768
just as he claims.

410
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:29,972
All set, Commander.

411
00:21:30,012 --> 00:21:32,483
Major, how many images were sent
from the Bajoran archives?

412
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:33,647
Only one.

413
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:35,990
It's the only picture
they could find of Gallitep

414
00:21:36,027 --> 00:21:37,155
that had Marritza in it.

415
00:21:37,197 --> 00:21:38,393
The Cardassians destroyed

416
00:21:38,433 --> 00:21:40,164
almost all records
of the occupation.

417
00:21:40,204 --> 00:21:42,175
The image enhancement
and transformation functions

418
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:43,769
are patched directly
into your console.

419
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,281
Major, what if this image
confirms

420
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:48,915
that Marritza was a file clerk?

421
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:51,361
What do you expect us
to do then?

422
00:21:51,397 --> 00:21:53,459
I suppose you'll let him go.

423
00:21:53,502 --> 00:21:55,370
I'm glad we understand
each other.

424
00:21:55,407 --> 00:21:56,375
I've got it.

425
00:21:56,409 --> 00:21:58,209
On screen.

426
00:21:58,247 --> 00:21:59,682
Which one is Marritza?

427
00:21:59,717 --> 00:22:01,517
Let's see... according
to the caption

428
00:22:01,555 --> 00:22:03,583
he's the one
in the background

429
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:04,925
in the far right.

430
00:22:04,963 --> 00:22:06,900
Isolate and magnify.

431
00:22:10,008 --> 00:22:12,343
You're going to have
to do better than that.

432
00:22:12,381 --> 00:22:13,349
Give me a minute.

433
00:22:13,383 --> 00:22:15,820
I'm running an image
enhancement sequence.

434
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:22,127
It's not him.

435
00:22:22,171 --> 00:22:25,303
Are you sure
we're looking at the right man?

436
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:28,250
Background, far right,
Aamin Marritza.

437
00:22:28,286 --> 00:22:30,484
It can't be.

438
00:22:30,524 --> 00:22:33,520
If that's Marritza,
then who are we holding here?

439
00:22:37,808 --> 00:22:40,610
Lieutenant,
isolate the Cardassians

440
00:22:40,648 --> 00:22:42,174
in the foreground.

441
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:46,423
The one in profile on the left...
what can you give us?

442
00:22:56,553 --> 00:22:58,456
That's him.
That's Marritza.

443
00:22:58,491 --> 00:23:00,359
Not according to the caption.

444
00:23:00,396 --> 00:23:01,421
What do you mean?

445
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:04,871
According to this,
it's Gul Darhe'el.

446
00:23:11,455 --> 00:23:12,651
Let me guess.

447
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:15,722
You've come back to learn
the secret of my filing system.

448
00:23:15,766 --> 00:23:18,033
I know all your secrets now.

449
00:23:18,072 --> 00:23:19,040
Is that so?

450
00:23:19,074 --> 00:23:20,042
What did you do?

451
00:23:20,076 --> 00:23:22,240
Did you kill the real Marritza

452
00:23:22,281 --> 00:23:24,309
so you could take his place?

453
00:23:24,353 --> 00:23:26,654
Well, you'll pay for that death

454
00:23:26,693 --> 00:23:29,791
and all the others
you're responsible for.

455
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:32,337
Oh, I don't think I could pay
for all of them, Major...

456
00:23:32,373 --> 00:23:34,810
there were so many... and you
can only execute me once.

457
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,042
That's my only regret.

458
00:23:37,084 --> 00:23:41,424
But... I'll settle for knowing
that Bajor will finally have

459
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:45,426
the satisfaction of punishing
the Butcher of Gallitep.

460
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:47,271
Tell me, Major.

461
00:23:47,308 --> 00:23:50,110
Did you figure this out
all by yourself?

462
00:23:50,148 --> 00:23:53,782
Or did you have help
from your Federation masters?

463
00:23:53,824 --> 00:23:56,057
I'll let you
wonder about that.

464
00:23:56,096 --> 00:23:57,190
It'll keep you occupied

465
00:23:57,232 --> 00:23:59,328
while we're waiting
for the provisional government

466
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,773
to prepare
your war crimes tribunal.

467
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,245
War crimes?

468
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,751
How could there be war crimes

469
00:24:05,786 --> 00:24:07,689
when there hasn't been a war?

470
00:24:07,724 --> 00:24:11,187
I can understand your wish
that there had been a war.

471
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:14,034
Your need to indulge
some pathetic fantasy

472
00:24:14,073 --> 00:24:18,038
about brave Bajoran soldiers
marching to honorable defeat.

473
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,050
But, in fact, Major

474
00:24:19,085 --> 00:24:21,056
you and I know
there was no war, no glory.

475
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:23,722
Bajor didn't resist.

476
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,562
It surrendered.

477
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,628
The Bajorans were a peaceful
people before you came.

478
00:24:27,672 --> 00:24:28,834
We offered no threat to you.

479
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:32,145
We could never understand
why you had to be so brutal.

480
00:24:32,182 --> 00:24:33,583
Well, we can't have that, Major.

481
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:35,088
I want no more secrets
between us.

482
00:24:35,123 --> 00:24:37,356
Anything you don't understand
I'll explain to you.

483
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:39,627
Thank you, but I think
I've heard enough of your lies.

484
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:40,726
What lies?

485
00:24:40,769 --> 00:24:42,899
You mean my failure
to divulge my true identity?

486
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:45,105
Believe me, Major,
I yearned to tell you

487
00:24:45,147 --> 00:24:47,881
but I knew how much more
satisfaction you would have

488
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,287
if you found out for yourself.

489
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:50,758
And that was my only deception.

490
00:24:50,793 --> 00:24:52,456
Marritza was
a magnificent file clerk

491
00:24:52,498 --> 00:24:53,831
and I, Gul Darhe'el...

492
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:57,068
I hope you'll not think it
immodest of me to say so...

493
00:24:57,109 --> 00:24:59,137
but I was a magnificent leader.

494
00:24:59,181 --> 00:25:01,618
Oh, you never saw Gallitep
at its height.

495
00:25:01,653 --> 00:25:02,883
For a labor camp

496
00:25:02,923 --> 00:25:05,326
it was the very model
of order and efficiency.

497
00:25:05,362 --> 00:25:06,490
And why?

498
00:25:06,531 --> 00:25:08,661
For that, you have
to look to the top.

499
00:25:08,703 --> 00:25:09,728
To me!

500
00:25:09,773 --> 00:25:12,610
My word,
my every glance was law

501
00:25:12,646 --> 00:25:15,244
and the verdict
was always the same... guilty.

502
00:25:15,285 --> 00:25:16,584
You're insane.

503
00:25:16,622 --> 00:25:18,091
Oh, no, no, Major.

504
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:20,255
You can't dismiss me
that easily.

505
00:25:20,297 --> 00:25:22,097
I did what had to be done.

506
00:25:22,135 --> 00:25:25,735
My men understood that,
and that's why they loved me.

507
00:25:25,777 --> 00:25:28,409
I would order them to go out
and kill Bajoran scum

508
00:25:28,451 --> 00:25:30,854
and they'd do it,
they'd murder them

509
00:25:30,889 --> 00:25:34,854
and they'd come back covered
in blood, but they felt clean.

510
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:37,701
Now, why did they feel
that way, Major?

511
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,540
Because they were clean.

512
00:25:39,577 --> 00:25:41,240
You admit your atrocities.

513
00:25:41,282 --> 00:25:43,378
I admit everything.

514
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,120
Why not?
I was the best at what I did.

515
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,427
My accomplishments
speak for themselves.

516
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:49,661
Can you say the same?

517
00:25:49,702 --> 00:25:52,504
You and that little Shakaar
resistance cell

518
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:53,670
that you belonged to.

519
00:25:53,711 --> 00:25:55,511
All you did was
annoy Cardassians

520
00:25:55,549 --> 00:25:57,679
while I was out
exterminating Bajorans.

521
00:25:57,721 --> 00:25:59,817
Make sure you tell that
to the tribunal.

522
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,123
Oh, I will.

523
00:26:01,163 --> 00:26:02,826
Then they'll sentence you
to death.

524
00:26:02,866 --> 00:26:03,834
Let them.

525
00:26:03,868 --> 00:26:06,339
Don't you see, it doesn't
change anything?

526
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:08,973
Kill me, torture me...
it doesn't matter.

527
00:26:09,015 --> 00:26:10,644
You've already lost, Major.

528
00:26:10,685 --> 00:26:13,249
You can never undo
what I've accomplished.

529
00:26:13,292 --> 00:26:15,092
The dead will still be dead.

530
00:26:17,234 --> 00:26:19,705
What will you do now, Major?

531
00:26:19,741 --> 00:26:21,735
Withhold my medicine?

532
00:26:42,131 --> 00:26:43,259
Here.

533
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:44,598
This will help.

534
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:45,764
What is it?

535
00:26:45,806 --> 00:26:47,435
Maraltian <i>seev-ale</i>

536
00:26:47,476 --> 00:26:49,811
from Quark's private stock.

537
00:26:53,257 --> 00:26:56,389
Better?

538
00:26:56,432 --> 00:26:58,266
You know, Odo

539
00:26:58,302 --> 00:27:01,002
I wonder how many others
like Darhe'el

540
00:27:01,042 --> 00:27:02,568
are still out there...

541
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,309
still free, unpunished.

542
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,253
Quite a few, no doubt

543
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:10,595
but thanks to you,
there's one less out there now.

544
00:27:10,699 --> 00:27:12,863
You should have heard him.

545
00:27:12,904 --> 00:27:16,504
He bragged about
what happened at Gallitep...

546
00:27:16,546 --> 00:27:19,987
the torture, the murders,
the humiliation.

547
00:27:20,021 --> 00:27:22,892
He's proud
about what he did to us.

548
00:27:22,928 --> 00:27:24,899
Why don't you go
to your quarters

549
00:27:24,933 --> 00:27:26,927
and lie down for a while?

550
00:27:26,972 --> 00:27:29,911
We'll leave him alone
with his Cardassian pride.

551
00:27:29,945 --> 00:27:31,642
I don't want to lie down.

552
00:27:31,749 --> 00:27:33,617
No, that's what he'd like...

553
00:27:33,654 --> 00:27:36,125
another Bajoran
hiding in a corner.

554
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,132
He's probably in there
laughing at me right now.

555
00:27:39,167 --> 00:27:41,434
He won't be laughing very long.

556
00:27:41,473 --> 00:27:43,341
I hate him, Odo.

557
00:27:43,377 --> 00:27:48,185
I hate his smirking,
superior Cardassian face.

558
00:27:48,222 --> 00:27:50,693
When I was fighting
with the resistance

559
00:27:50,728 --> 00:27:52,631
we used to lie awake at night

560
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:55,798
plotting the assassination
of men like Darhe'el.

561
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,141
Now I have to stand there
and listen to him

562
00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:00,845
belittle the Shakaar
and everything it stood for.

563
00:28:00,886 --> 00:28:04,851
Perhaps you should avoid
discussing your personal history

564
00:28:04,896 --> 00:28:06,365
with a creature like that.

565
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,370
I didn't.

566
00:28:10,408 --> 00:28:13,780
Then how did he know
you were with the Shakaar?

567
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,381
I don't know...

568
00:28:16,423 --> 00:28:19,693
he was an important
military leader.

569
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,599
That doesn't explain it.

570
00:28:21,636 --> 00:28:25,806
If he'd been in charge
of quelling Bajoran resistance

571
00:28:25,846 --> 00:28:29,013
then he might have had
your name on file

572
00:28:29,053 --> 00:28:31,890
but he commanded
a forced labor camp.

573
00:28:31,926 --> 00:28:34,090
Something's not right here.

574
00:28:36,605 --> 00:28:38,576
Where are you going?

575
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,606
To have another little chat
with Gul Darhe'el.

576
00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:50,027
Computer, review
all off-station requests

577
00:28:50,071 --> 00:28:53,238
for information regarding
Major Kira Nerys

578
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:55,545
within the last eight months.

579
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:56,745
Working.

580
00:28:56,786 --> 00:28:58,757
Oh, back to see the Butcher.

581
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:00,522
Am I really so fascinating?

582
00:29:00,562 --> 00:29:03,934
How did you know
I was with the Shakaar?

583
00:29:05,675 --> 00:29:07,578
This provisional
government of yours

584
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,013
certainly moves slowly.

585
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:11,384
They should have dragged me
away in chains by now.

586
00:29:11,422 --> 00:29:12,755
Just answer the question!

587
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:16,095
Oh, my, my, you are
a strutting little egotist.

588
00:29:16,133 --> 00:29:20,040
You forget the brilliance
of Marritza's filing system.

589
00:29:20,076 --> 00:29:22,138
He made sure that I was provided
with information

590
00:29:22,181 --> 00:29:24,448
on all your little
terrorist bands.

591
00:29:24,486 --> 00:29:27,618
What I particularly enjoyed
were the termination reports.

592
00:29:29,164 --> 00:29:32,730
Yes, life in a forced labor camp
can be so isolating.

593
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:34,435
At times, I felt that I alone

594
00:29:34,477 --> 00:29:37,279
bore the burden of cleansing
Bajor of its rabble

595
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:41,259
but those reports reassured me,
I was not alone.

596
00:29:41,293 --> 00:29:44,232
And I'm supposed to believe
you remembered my name

597
00:29:44,266 --> 00:29:46,464
from some report
you read years ago?

598
00:29:48,109 --> 00:29:51,481
At the risk of bruising
your vanity even further, Major

599
00:29:51,518 --> 00:29:55,050
I didn't remember you at all
until I heard your name here.

600
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,189
I can see that disturbs you.

601
00:29:57,232 --> 00:29:58,701
Hardly.

602
00:29:58,735 --> 00:30:01,606
You know, Major,
they will be coming for me soon

603
00:30:01,642 --> 00:30:03,111
so before we say good-bye

604
00:30:03,145 --> 00:30:05,982
there are a few little questions
I should like to ask you.

605
00:30:06,019 --> 00:30:08,320
Your questions
don't interest me.

606
00:30:08,358 --> 00:30:10,625
How can you be so sure?

607
00:30:10,663 --> 00:30:13,693
Or are you just
afraid to hear them?

608
00:30:37,828 --> 00:30:39,297
Who are they?

609
00:30:39,332 --> 00:30:41,896
Survivors of Gallitep.

610
00:30:41,938 --> 00:30:43,909
They arrived early this morning.

611
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:46,643
I suppose they are waiting
for justice.

612
00:30:46,683 --> 00:30:47,811
Gallitep.

613
00:30:47,852 --> 00:30:50,825
Imagine living
through that hellhole.

614
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,090
The pain...

615
00:30:52,129 --> 00:30:55,433
the sorrow...

616
00:30:55,471 --> 00:30:58,137
Do you think
they like to gamble?

617
00:31:08,836 --> 00:31:10,203
Doctor, I need your help.

618
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,299
Of course.

619
00:31:11,342 --> 00:31:14,474
Three months ago,
a request came from Kora II

620
00:31:14,517 --> 00:31:16,988
for information
concerning Kira Nerys.

621
00:31:17,056 --> 00:31:17,989
To what purpose?

622
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:19,187
I'm not sure.

623
00:31:19,227 --> 00:31:22,497
But the name on the request
was Aamin Marritza.

624
00:31:22,536 --> 00:31:25,908
I've established
a subspace link with Kora II

625
00:31:25,944 --> 00:31:29,476
and I'd like you to access
his medical history there.

626
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:30,886
Dax to Odo.

627
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:34,523
Gul Dukat is responding
to your subspace transmission.

628
00:31:34,565 --> 00:31:35,864
Could you route it
to my office?

629
00:31:35,901 --> 00:31:36,891
Aye, sir.

630
00:31:38,707 --> 00:31:41,874
I do miss working with you, Odo.

631
00:31:41,915 --> 00:31:45,686
I miss our games
of Kalevian montar.

632
00:31:45,724 --> 00:31:48,891
As I recall, Gul Dukat,
we played one game

633
00:31:48,932 --> 00:31:50,265
and you cheated.

634
00:31:53,076 --> 00:31:56,072
The same old Odo...

635
00:31:56,183 --> 00:31:59,521
like a blunt instrument.

636
00:31:59,558 --> 00:32:01,688
But now to your question.

637
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:06,196
I regret that I cannot give you
access to any of the files

638
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,541
pertaining to Gul Darhe'el.

639
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:09,912
But I assure you

640
00:32:09,949 --> 00:32:13,891
the files would only tell you
what I am telling you.

641
00:32:13,926 --> 00:32:16,397
Gul Darhe'el is dead.

642
00:32:16,431 --> 00:32:19,165
That's not possible.

643
00:32:19,205 --> 00:32:21,608
I attended his funeral myself.

644
00:32:21,644 --> 00:32:24,242
As a matter of fact, he's buried

645
00:32:24,283 --> 00:32:28,954
under one of the largest
military monuments on Cardassia.

646
00:32:28,995 --> 00:32:31,763
Then who are we holding here?

647
00:32:31,802 --> 00:32:34,798
Some innocent
Cardassian citizen

648
00:32:34,842 --> 00:32:37,815
as I explained
to your Commander Sisko.

649
00:32:37,849 --> 00:32:39,945
And we want him released.

650
00:32:39,988 --> 00:32:41,685
That innocent citizen

651
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:45,258
has admitted he is Gul Darhe'el.

652
00:32:45,301 --> 00:32:50,041
What... are you saying?

653
00:32:50,078 --> 00:32:55,148
He says
his name is Gul Darhe'el.

654
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,990
Then he's lying.

655
00:32:57,029 --> 00:32:58,726
Well, if he is,
it's the most foolish lie

656
00:32:58,766 --> 00:32:59,734
he could have invented.

657
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,170
It's likely to get him executed.

658
00:33:01,205 --> 00:33:02,936
Why would anyone
do such a thing?

659
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,104
I don't know

660
00:33:04,212 --> 00:33:08,017
but I tell you
I attended Darhe'el's funeral.

661
00:33:08,055 --> 00:33:12,088
You're sure the man
you saw buried was Gul Darhe'el?

662
00:33:12,131 --> 00:33:15,697
Half of Cardassia
viewed his body.

663
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,677
I saw a photograph
of Gul Darhe'el

664
00:33:17,712 --> 00:33:19,683
taken at the Gallitep
labor camp.

665
00:33:19,717 --> 00:33:21,984
It certainly appears to be
the man we're holding.

666
00:33:22,022 --> 00:33:23,321
You're mistaken.

667
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:24,384
Am I?

668
00:33:24,427 --> 00:33:26,330
This is obviously some plot

669
00:33:26,366 --> 00:33:28,895
to embarrass
the Cardassian Empire.

670
00:33:28,939 --> 00:33:31,776
It's possible.

671
00:33:31,812 --> 00:33:34,283
Give me access to your files

672
00:33:34,318 --> 00:33:36,186
and perhaps I can find
some proof

673
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:39,856
to support your claim
that Gul Darhe'el is dead.

674
00:33:42,905 --> 00:33:49,649
I suppose I could grant you
limited access to the files.

675
00:33:49,688 --> 00:33:53,892
I think that's wise.

676
00:33:58,443 --> 00:34:00,414
I was 12
when I started fighting

677
00:34:00,448 --> 00:34:02,942
but I've heard of some
who were even younger than that.

678
00:34:02,986 --> 00:34:05,480
Yes, yes,
let's get to the real issue!

679
00:34:05,526 --> 00:34:08,522
How many Cardassians
did you kill?

680
00:34:08,567 --> 00:34:10,196
I mean personally.

681
00:34:10,237 --> 00:34:12,835
I didn't keep count.

682
00:34:12,877 --> 00:34:14,073
Oh, I think you did.

683
00:34:14,113 --> 00:34:16,346
And I'm sure your total
wasn't limited

684
00:34:16,385 --> 00:34:17,718
to military personnel.

685
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:20,489
After all, the most effective
terrorist weapon

686
00:34:20,529 --> 00:34:21,759
was random violence.

687
00:34:21,798 --> 00:34:23,097
Don't leave now, Major.

688
00:34:23,134 --> 00:34:24,501
It's just getting good.

689
00:34:24,538 --> 00:34:27,067
How many Cardassian
civilians did you kill?

690
00:34:27,111 --> 00:34:30,574
Look! I regret a lot
of what I had to do.

691
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,816
How convenient of you.

692
00:34:31,856 --> 00:34:34,089
We had no choice!
We were fighting for survival.

693
00:34:34,128 --> 00:34:35,153
So were we.

694
00:34:35,197 --> 00:34:37,259
We had an Empire to protect.

695
00:34:37,302 --> 00:34:38,931
We needed your resources.

696
00:34:38,972 --> 00:34:40,100
Everything I did

697
00:34:40,142 --> 00:34:42,613
was for the greater glory
of Cardassia!

698
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:45,622
And if you spineless scum
had to be ground under

699
00:34:45,656 --> 00:34:46,886
so much the better.

700
00:34:46,926 --> 00:34:49,022
All that mattered was Cardassia.

701
00:34:49,064 --> 00:34:50,294
I loved my homeland.

702
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:52,167
That's what justified
my actions.

703
00:34:52,204 --> 00:34:54,266
That's what gave me strength.

704
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:57,306
Nothing justifies genocide.

705
00:34:57,417 --> 00:35:01,416
What you call genocide,
I call a day's work.

706
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:07,634
Major, could I have
a word with you?

707
00:35:19,971 --> 00:35:23,275
Dr. Bashir and I have
done some checking.

708
00:35:23,312 --> 00:35:24,941
I don't know why yet

709
00:35:24,983 --> 00:35:30,087
but the man in that cell
wanted to be caught.

710
00:35:41,794 --> 00:35:43,628
This certificate of death

711
00:35:43,666 --> 00:35:46,605
was in the file sent
to me by Gul Dukat.

712
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:50,604
According to this, Gul Darhe'el
died in his sleep six years ago.

713
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:53,451
"Cause of death...
massive coleibric hemorrhage."

714
00:35:53,489 --> 00:35:56,519
Commander, I guarantee you
that is a forged document.

715
00:35:56,563 --> 00:35:58,625
I think it's pretty clear
what's going on here.

716
00:35:58,668 --> 00:36:00,969
The Cardassians
are trying to trick us

717
00:36:01,007 --> 00:36:02,237
into letting him go.

718
00:36:02,277 --> 00:36:04,305
I wouldn't put it past
our friend Gul Dukat.

719
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:06,616
Nor would I, however...

720
00:36:06,654 --> 00:36:10,117
The man in there confessed
he is Gul Darhe'el.

721
00:36:10,162 --> 00:36:13,432
Major, the man in there
has Kalla-Nohra syndrome.

722
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,963
Of course he does.

723
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:17,377
According to the evidence
I've been sent

724
00:36:17,413 --> 00:36:20,147
Gul Darhe'el
never contracted that condition.

725
00:36:20,186 --> 00:36:23,592
More evidence
from our trustworthy Gul Dukat.

726
00:36:25,399 --> 00:36:27,563
What have you got, Constable?

727
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:30,202
Darhe'el's progress reports
from Gallitep

728
00:36:30,244 --> 00:36:32,944
show that, when
the mining accident occurred

729
00:36:32,984 --> 00:36:34,510
he was back on Cardassia

730
00:36:34,554 --> 00:36:37,391
being awarded the Proficient
Service Medallion.

731
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:40,492
If he wasn't at Gallitep
on the day on the accident

732
00:36:40,535 --> 00:36:43,201
then he couldn't have contracted
Kalla-Nohra.

733
00:36:43,241 --> 00:36:44,209
Correct.

734
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:47,946
But the man we're holding
does have it.

735
00:36:47,986 --> 00:36:50,618
I can't believe
I'm listening to this.

736
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,858
I'm afraid there's more, Major.

737
00:36:52,898 --> 00:36:56,600
I inquired about this man's
last two weeks on Kora II.

738
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,511
He resigned his position
at the military academy

739
00:36:59,547 --> 00:37:01,016
put all his affairs in order

740
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:03,488
and even provided handsomely
for his housekeeper

741
00:37:03,524 --> 00:37:04,823
I understand.

742
00:37:04,927 --> 00:37:06,157
All right, all right.

743
00:37:06,196 --> 00:37:08,497
So, like any criminal,
he wanted to move on

744
00:37:08,536 --> 00:37:10,837
before somebody traced
his whereabouts.

745
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:13,108
He specifically
requested passage

746
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:16,245
on a vessel that was scheduled
to stop here...

747
00:37:16,287 --> 00:37:17,756
at a Bajoran station.

748
00:37:17,792 --> 00:37:21,494
Rather unusual request
for a Cardassian war criminal.

749
00:37:21,534 --> 00:37:24,598
Unless he wanted to be captured.

750
00:37:24,641 --> 00:37:25,871
Wait a minute.

751
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:27,847
Let's be clear about one thing.

752
00:37:27,882 --> 00:37:31,014
This evidence may raise
some interesting questions.

753
00:37:31,056 --> 00:37:34,519
Nevertheless, Darhe'el is going
to be sent back to Bajor

754
00:37:34,565 --> 00:37:37,470
to stand trial
for the atrocities he committed.

755
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,533
Major, that is still
to be determined.

756
00:37:39,577 --> 00:37:41,377
Well, then go talk to him.

757
00:37:41,415 --> 00:37:45,653
If you still have any doubts,
listen to what he has to say.

758
00:37:45,692 --> 00:37:47,492
He was there.
He did it.

759
00:37:47,529 --> 00:37:49,158
He'll tell you about it.

760
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,045
Constable, I've checked
on Marritza's medical record.

761
00:37:55,081 --> 00:37:56,311
What have we got?

762
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,444
He's under treatment

763
00:37:57,486 --> 00:37:59,354
for Kalla-Nohra
syndrome, of course

764
00:37:59,391 --> 00:38:02,421
and a few other minor ailments,
most relating to his age.

765
00:38:02,465 --> 00:38:05,404
It's all pretty standard,
really, except for one thing.

766
00:38:05,438 --> 00:38:06,566
Which is?

767
00:38:06,608 --> 00:38:10,174
Five years ago,
after arriving on Kora II

768
00:38:10,217 --> 00:38:14,387
he started taking massive doses
of dermatiraelian plastiscine

769
00:38:14,427 --> 00:38:16,364
which is a dermal
regenerative agent

770
00:38:16,398 --> 00:38:18,163
used to maintain
skin resilience

771
00:38:18,202 --> 00:38:21,472
after cosmetic alteration.

772
00:38:23,683 --> 00:38:25,847
You're saying
he changed his face

773
00:38:25,888 --> 00:38:27,688
to look like Gul Darhe'el.

774
00:38:27,725 --> 00:38:29,992
It certainly appears that way.

775
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:44,262
How are you feeling?

776
00:38:44,298 --> 00:38:45,562
I was starting to get
a little bored

777
00:38:45,601 --> 00:38:48,095
but seeing you again
brightens my day.

778
00:38:48,141 --> 00:38:51,012
I was referring
to your Kalla-Nohra Syndrome.

779
00:38:51,048 --> 00:38:54,021
Would you like to see
Dr. Bashir?

780
00:38:54,055 --> 00:38:55,217
Oh, so that's it.

781
00:38:55,258 --> 00:38:58,425
You want to see me writhing
around the floor in pain.

782
00:38:58,465 --> 00:39:00,265
A Cardassian would never put on

783
00:39:00,303 --> 00:39:02,797
such a deplorable display
in front of a Bajoran.

784
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:04,745
You just don't
understand us at all.

785
00:39:04,781 --> 00:39:08,313
I'm beginning to understand
a great deal about you.

786
00:39:08,356 --> 00:39:10,121
One thing does puzzle me.

787
00:39:10,161 --> 00:39:11,721
And what would that be?

788
00:39:11,764 --> 00:39:14,737
How you contracted
Kalla-Nohra Syndrome.

789
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:16,765
Do you think
that the mining accident

790
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:18,644
affected only
the Bajoran laborers

791
00:39:18,681 --> 00:39:20,446
and not
their Cardassian masters?

792
00:39:20,485 --> 00:39:21,818
That would be very nice.

793
00:39:21,855 --> 00:39:23,449
So you're saying
you were at Gallitep

794
00:39:23,492 --> 00:39:25,018
when that mining accident
occurred.

795
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:26,030
Of course.

796
00:39:26,065 --> 00:39:27,659
Why are we going over
this again?

797
00:39:27,702 --> 00:39:29,673
Because your own progress report

798
00:39:29,707 --> 00:39:32,305
shows you were back on Cardassia
at the time of the accident.

799
00:39:32,347 --> 00:39:33,611
That's ridiculous.

800
00:39:33,649 --> 00:39:36,554
Receiving your
Proficient Service Medallion.

801
00:39:36,591 --> 00:39:38,026
The reports are wrong.

802
00:39:38,061 --> 00:39:39,428
I can show them to you.

803
00:39:39,464 --> 00:39:40,660
That won't be necessary.

804
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,896
I know where I was.

805
00:39:41,936 --> 00:39:44,568
Why were you taking
a dermal regenerative?

806
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:46,911
I don't know
what you're talking about.

807
00:39:46,948 --> 00:39:48,212
Then let me help you.

808
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:51,658
Five years ago,
when you first got to Kora II...

809
00:39:51,693 --> 00:39:52,661
All right, that's enough!

810
00:39:52,695 --> 00:39:54,358
Your presence no longer
amuses me. Get out!

811
00:39:54,399 --> 00:39:55,732
Why did you have
your face altered?

812
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:57,204
Security, get this woman
out of here!

813
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:59,939
Why are you pretending
to be Gul Darhe'el?

814
00:39:59,979 --> 00:40:02,577
Why don't you ask me
something intelligent?!

815
00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:03,747
As for instance, how did I feel

816
00:40:03,789 --> 00:40:05,885
when we were withdrawing
from Bajor?

817
00:40:05,928 --> 00:40:07,625
The answer is I was furious.

818
00:40:07,665 --> 00:40:10,229
The thought of leaving
any survivors behind

819
00:40:10,271 --> 00:40:11,467
was repulsive to me.

820
00:40:11,507 --> 00:40:13,535
So while our useless
office clerks

821
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:15,242
were packing
their precious files

822
00:40:15,283 --> 00:40:17,151
I ordered my overseers

823
00:40:17,187 --> 00:40:20,126
to begin slaughtering
the laborers.

824
00:40:20,161 --> 00:40:22,759
If you felt that way
about your filing clerks

825
00:40:22,801 --> 00:40:24,270
why did you take
Marritza's name?

826
00:40:24,304 --> 00:40:26,172
My plan was to do nothing less

827
00:40:26,243 --> 00:40:28,441
than kill every Bajoran
in the camp

828
00:40:28,481 --> 00:40:31,887
and, to this day, my one regret
is that I was not able

829
00:40:31,923 --> 00:40:34,053
to accomplish
this honorable goal.

830
00:40:34,095 --> 00:40:37,193
You're Marritza, aren't you?

831
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:39,867
You mistake me for that bug?

832
00:40:39,908 --> 00:40:41,537
That whimpering nothing?

833
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:43,516
Oh, you stupid Bajoran girl.

834
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,213
Don't you know who I am?

835
00:40:45,255 --> 00:40:46,747
I'm your nemesis.

836
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:48,352
I'm your nightmare.

837
00:40:48,396 --> 00:40:50,697
I'm the Butcher of Gallitep.

838
00:40:50,734 --> 00:40:53,798
The Butcher of Gallitep
died six years ago.

839
00:40:53,842 --> 00:40:56,815
You're Aamin Marritza,
his filing clerk.

840
00:40:56,849 --> 00:40:58,079
That's not true.

841
00:40:58,119 --> 00:40:59,144
I am alive.

842
00:40:59,188 --> 00:41:01,717
I will always be alive!

843
00:41:01,761 --> 00:41:04,198
It's Marritza who is dead.

844
00:41:04,267 --> 00:41:06,899
Marritza,
who was good for nothing

845
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:11,144
but cowering under his bunk
and weeping like a woman.

846
00:41:11,184 --> 00:41:14,385
Who, every night,
covered his ears

847
00:41:14,424 --> 00:41:17,363
because he couldn't bear to hear

848
00:41:17,399 --> 00:41:21,033
the screaming for mercy
of the Bajorans.

849
00:41:37,714 --> 00:41:40,049
Covered my ears every night,
but...

850
00:41:40,086 --> 00:41:44,085
I couldn't bear to hear
those horrible screams.

851
00:41:44,129 --> 00:41:48,265
You have no idea
what it's like to be a coward...

852
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:51,438
to see these horrors...

853
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,074
and do nothing.

854
00:41:53,117 --> 00:41:54,416
Marritza's dead.

855
00:41:54,454 --> 00:41:56,482
He deserves to be dead.

856
00:42:02,807 --> 00:42:04,778
What are you doing?

857
00:42:04,812 --> 00:42:07,546
I'm letting you go.

858
00:42:07,586 --> 00:42:09,784
Security?

859
00:42:09,824 --> 00:42:11,487
Get in here.

860
00:42:15,671 --> 00:42:17,835
You didn't commit those crimes

861
00:42:17,877 --> 00:42:19,848
and you couldn't stop them.

862
00:42:19,882 --> 00:42:21,613
You were only one man.

863
00:42:21,652 --> 00:42:23,087
No, no, don't you see?

864
00:42:23,122 --> 00:42:24,557
I have to be punished.

865
00:42:24,592 --> 00:42:26,323
We all have to be punished.

866
00:42:26,397 --> 00:42:28,926
Major, you have
to go out and tell them

867
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:30,064
I'm Gul Darhe'el.

868
00:42:30,106 --> 00:42:31,302
It's the only way.

869
00:42:31,342 --> 00:42:34,748
Why are you doing this?

870
00:42:34,784 --> 00:42:36,219
For Cardassia.

871
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:38,157
Cardassia will only survive

872
00:42:38,191 --> 00:42:41,825
if it stands in front of Bajor
and admits the truth.

873
00:42:41,868 --> 00:42:45,970
My trial will force Cardassia
to acknowledge its guilt

874
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:48,676
and we're guilty, all of us.

875
00:42:48,717 --> 00:42:51,987
My death is necessary.

876
00:42:53,929 --> 00:42:57,563
What you're asking for
is another murder.

877
00:42:57,606 --> 00:43:02,573
Enough good people
have already died.

878
00:43:02,618 --> 00:43:04,929
I won't help kill another.

879
00:43:19,898 --> 00:43:23,134
You should be back on Kora II
in three days.

880
00:43:23,172 --> 00:43:25,940
Well, there's nothing
for me to go back to.

881
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:28,109
We've contacted officials there.

882
00:43:28,151 --> 00:43:30,213
They'll be waiting to help you.

883
00:43:30,256 --> 00:43:32,956
If they believed
that I was Gul Darhe'el

884
00:43:32,996 --> 00:43:37,166
then my trial might have helped
to bring about a new Cardassia.

885
00:43:37,206 --> 00:43:40,236
Now you've told them
I was just a file clerk.

886
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,014
What you tried to do
was very honorable.

887
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:45,320
If Cardassia is going to change

888
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:47,761
it's going to need
people like you.

889
00:44:02,499 --> 00:44:03,627
Why?!

890
00:44:03,669 --> 00:44:05,697
He wasn't Darhe'el!
Why?!

891
00:44:05,741 --> 00:44:07,267
He's a Cardassian!

892
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,145
That's reason enough.

893
00:44:09,183 --> 00:44:10,777
No!

894
00:44:13,894 --> 00:44:16,365
It's not.
