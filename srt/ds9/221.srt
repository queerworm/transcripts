1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,087
<i>Last time on</i>
Deep Space Nine...

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:07,299
A number of Admirals
at Starfleet Command are worried

3
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:09,050
the destruction
of the<i> Bok'nor</i>

4
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:11,094
might jeopardize the treaty.
Oh, are they really?

5
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:14,055
As the two ranking officers
along the Cardassian border,

6
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:17,100
we've been asked to assess
the potential risk.

7
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,811
I wish to procure weapons.

8
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:20,938
I beg your pardon?

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,858
Guns, phaser banks,
photon torpedoes...

10
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,234
Shh.
...troop transports,

11
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,196
and a number of
cobalt-thorium devices.

12
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:30,489
You're a gun runner?

13
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,240
I'm here unofficially

14
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,827
to help you find out
the truth about the<i> Bok'nor.</i>

15
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:36,328
Why would you want to help me?

16
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,497
Because I already know
the truth.

17
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,582
I've got people out there
killing people, Major.

18
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,751
You suggest I turn
a blind eye to that?

19
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:45,337
They don't have a right
to defend themselves?
They've crossed the line!

20
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,381
If Starfleet is unwilling
to defend their people...

21
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,508
They chose to live
with the Cardassians!

22
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,636
Well, I didn't!
But I lived with them
for 26 years

23
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:56,181
before the liberation came.
Every Bajoran lived with them
in constant fear.

24
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,433
I know what those colonists
are going through.

25
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:05,315
We just received
a general subspace
transmission

26
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:07,275
from somewhere in the
Demilitarized Zone.

27
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,652
A group there
is taking credit

28
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:10,111
for the kidnapping
of Dukat.

29
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,739
They're calling
themselves...

30
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,782
"the Maquis."

31
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:21,874
HUDSON:
I'm glad to see you had
no trouble finding us, Ben.

32
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:25,544
It seems that one disaster
after another

33
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:28,338
keeps bringing us
back together again.

34
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,008
<i>And now,</i>
<i>for the conclusion.</i>

35
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:43,228
You should have seen
the look on your face

36
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,814
when you saw me
standing there, Ben.

37
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:49,192
I hardly recognized you
without your uniform.

38
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:53,655
Well, it's been feeling
a little tight lately.

39
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,450
Just like that.

40
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,452
It's just a uniform, Ben.

41
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,079
Is that all it is?

42
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,163
I remember when
you first put it on.

43
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:06,334
Yes-- graduation day
at the Academy.

44
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,254
We both swore
that we'd be starship captains

45
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,048
by the time we were 30.

46
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,134
And admirals by 40.
Yes.

47
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:17,888
I think we've both done
pretty well for ourselves.

48
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,598
Yes, we have, haven't we?

49
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,143
But now, I've got
something better.

50
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:25,646
These settlers, Ben--

51
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,898
if you saw all they
have accomplished

52
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,484
without any help
from the Federation

53
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,570
then you'd fight
along with them.

54
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,405
I don't think so.

55
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,871
HUDSON:
They've traveled out here
to the back of the beyond

56
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:45,082
and built homes
out of the wilderness.

57
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:48,710
Now, maybe the Federation
can turn their backs on them,
but I can't.

58
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,005
I'm not asking you to,
but your joining
the Maquis

59
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,756
isn't helping anyone.

60
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,925
Your actions have only
endangered the treaty

61
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:57,011
and put millions
of lives at risk.

62
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,304
The Federation believes
that it can solve

63
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:03,725
every problem with a treaty,
but out here, on the frontier,

64
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,520
without the power
of the Federation
to back them up,

65
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,314
a treaty is only
a piece of paper.

66
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:13,234
Do you have evidence
that the Central Command
has violated the treaty?

67
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,194
Not yet, but we will.

68
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,989
If you're depending
on Gul Dukat for proof,

69
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:18,323
you're going to be
disappointed.

70
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,241
We'll find out, won't we?

71
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,369
I want him back, Cal.

72
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,121
He's not here.

73
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:26,040
Then where is he?

74
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,958
I never thought
I'd see the day

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,462
when you'd side
with a Cardassian
against me.

76
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,589
Damn it, Cal,
I'm on your side.

77
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,341
You've got a funny way
of showing it, Ben.

78
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,093
I'm trying to stop
you from making

79
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,761
one of the biggest
mistakes of your life.

80
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,388
The Federation
believes in the treaty.

81
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,973
If you destroy it,

82
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:45,059
Starfleet will
come after you,

83
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,686
and they won't be satisfied
until you're behind bars.

84
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:51,148
If we work together
to end the violence...

85
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,942
The violence will never end
as long as Central Command

86
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,945
continues to smuggle weapons
to their colonies.

87
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:00,032
I wish there were
a better way to
handle this thing.

88
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:01,700
I really do.

89
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,911
Nobody wants peace any
more than the Maquis.

90
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,747
And you're willing
to blow up Cardassian ships
to get it?

91
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,457
The<i> Bok'nor</i>
will never smuggle
weapons again.

92
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,460
And its crew members
won't be returning home
to their families either.

93
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,257
Look, you say
the Central Command

94
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,843
is behind the smuggling.
Fine, let's prove it.

95
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,845
How?
We'll go to Cardassia,

96
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,056
find the evidence
you need to back
up your claim,

97
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:26,225
and when we do, we'll
take it to the Federation.

98
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,728
No, the Federation
abandoned us.

99
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,939
Told us to take care
of ourselves.

100
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,357
Well, that's what we
intend to do, Ben,

101
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,861
but you--
you could be invaluable to us.

102
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,781
Let us use
your station.
For what?

103
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,574
A maintenance facility
for our ships.

104
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,284
I can't allow that.

105
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,245
Every week, innocent people

106
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,496
are murdered by the Cardassians.

107
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,750
I will not allow those deaths
to go unpunished.

108
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,294
You don't want peace, Cal.

109
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,504
You want revenge.

110
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:03,053
I prefer to call it retaliation.

111
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:06,389
I am sorry we won't be
working together, Benjamin.

112
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,268
It would have been nice.

113
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:15,274
Like... old times.

114
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,117
Commander!

115
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:26,743
Sorry, Benjamin.

116
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:27,869
No!

117
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,832
Okay, let's go.
Knowing Ben's temper

118
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,583
when he wakes up,
we won't want to be here.

119
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,752
Come on, let's move out.

120
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,545
Come on, here we go.

121
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,298
Let's go, come on.

122
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:51,430
Lieutenant, I want to speak with
the Cardassian Central Command.

123
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,225
Then you're in luck.
Legate Parn will be arriving
within the hour.

124
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,144
A Legate?
I feel honored.

125
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,062
While I'm waiting,
I want to speak with Starfleet.

126
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,356
Admiral Necheyev's
already here.

127
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,820
Chief, the Maquis must have
transferred Dukat off their ship

128
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,488
before they reached
that asteroid.

129
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,990
I want to know
where they've hid him.

130
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,699
I can retrace
their warp trail.

131
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,410
See if they met up
with any other ships.

132
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:14,577
Do it.

133
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,081
Admiral.

134
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,874
Commander, the Cardassian
Central Command

135
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,626
has gone on military alert

136
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,462
in response to the kidnapping
of Gul Dukat.

137
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,422
I'm not surprised.

138
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:28,258
This Security Chief of yours,
this shape-shifter...

139
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,843
Odo.
Odo.

140
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,678
Are you sure you
wouldn't be better off

141
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,721
with a Starfleet officer
heading your security team?

142
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,058
Admiral, I have complete
faith in Odo's ability
to do his job.

143
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,519
If you say so, Commander.
I do.

144
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,813
And as for Gul Dukat,
I assure you

145
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,441
we are taking all possible
steps to locate him.

146
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,818
Good. Keep me informed
of your progress.

147
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,029
I will. But, Admiral,

148
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,781
there is a bigger issue
here than rescuing Dukat.

149
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,575
And what is that?
The Maquis.

150
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,829
The Maquis are a bunch
of irresponsible hotheads.

151
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,707
These hotheads are
responsible for the
bombing of the<i> Bok'nor.</i>

152
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,625
I'm aware of that,
Commander.

153
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,253
We never should have allowed
those colonists to remain

154
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,214
on the Cardassian side
of the Demilitarized Zone.

155
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,841
Well, they're there, Admiral,
and they're not leaving.

156
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,426
What about
Commander Hudson?

157
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,927
He's lived with these people.

158
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,637
What's his analysis
of the situation?

159
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,432
I'll... have to ask him.

160
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,809
You do that.

161
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:26,191
And, Commander,
I want you to find the Maquis.

162
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:30,237
Talk to them. Remind them
that they're citizens
of the Federation.

163
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,364
That it is imperative
that we preserve

164
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,032
the treaty with
the Cardassians.

165
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,034
A treaty the Cardassians
may not be honoring.

166
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,912
Are you questioning
Federation policy, Commander?

167
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,540
All I know
is that the situation

168
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,543
in the Demilitarized Zone
is deteriorating rapidly.

169
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,921
Personally, I think
you're overstating
the problem.

170
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,881
Establish a dialogue
with the Maquis.

171
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,466
They're still
Federation citizens.

172
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:54,010
I'm sure they'll
listen to reason.

173
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,595
Good luck, Commander.

174
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,975
"Establish a dialogue."
What the hell does she think
I've been trying to do?

175
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,478
Commander.
Just because
a group of people

176
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,897
belong to the Federation,
that does not mean
that they are saints.

177
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,108
Excuse me.
Do you know
what the trouble is?

178
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,443
No.

179
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,819
The trouble is Earth.
Really?

180
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:15,782
On Earth, there is no poverty,
no crime, no war.

181
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:19,869
You look out the window
of Starfleet headquarters
and you see paradise.

182
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,414
Well, it's easy to be
a saint in paradise,

183
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:25,833
but the Maquis do not
live in paradise.

184
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,835
Out there,
in the Demilitarized Zone,

185
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,046
all the problems
haven't been solved yet.

186
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:33,925
Out there, there are no saints,
just people--

187
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,136
angry, scared,
determined people

188
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,555
who are going to do
whatever it takes to survive,

189
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:41,349
whether it meets with the
Federation's approval or not.

190
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,351
Makes sense to me.

191
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,274
Well, I'm glad
someone understands.

192
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,986
Legate Parn's ship just put in
at Docking Bay 5.

193
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:56,656
Maybe you'd like to give
the same speech to him.

194
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,409
I just might do that.

195
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:00,994
Odo to Sisko.

196
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,621
Go ahead, Constable.

197
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,372
I think you'd better
get down to Security.

198
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,083
I've caught one
of the Vulcan's accomplices.

199
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,296
I assure you, I had no idea

200
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,798
Sakonna was planning
to kidnap Gul Dukat.

201
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,926
Really? Then perhaps
you could explain
why the two of you

202
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:19,095
were spending
so much time together.

203
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,556
Surely it's no crime

204
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,808
keeping company
with a beautiful female.

205
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,020
You ought to try it, Odo.
It might improve
your disposition.

206
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,105
Do you expect us to believe
that a Vulcan

207
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,690
would be interested in you
for your lobes?

208
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:36,363
Vulcans are a species
that appreciate good ears.

209
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,698
Commander,
this is very embarrassing,

210
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,869
having to discuss my personal
life in such surroundings.

211
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,330
Embarrassment is going to be
the least of your problems

212
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:49,334
unless you tell me what kind
of business arrangement
you had with this woman.

213
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:53,754
All right, but first
I want to make it clear

214
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,508
that I was led astray
by Sakonna's feminine wiles.

215
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,637
Save the excuses, Quark.
Just tell us what
you were up to.

216
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,682
Sakonna was in the market
for certain items

217
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:06,100
which I was able to obtain.

218
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,436
At a considerable discount,
I might add.

219
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,230
What items?

220
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,527
We're waiting.

221
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:20,031
Let's see... where to begin?

222
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,243
She wanted
some deflector shields,

223
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:26,246
navigational arrays,

224
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,416
maybe a couple hundred
photon torpedoes...

225
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,292
Photon torpedoes!

226
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:34,837
And pulse cannons,
and some high-energy
disrupters.

227
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,299
Weapons! You sold weapons
to a terrorist group.

228
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:42,011
I did not. The Pygorians
sold them the weapons.

229
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:45,599
I merely...
made some introductions.

230
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,269
Besides, I hadn't even heard
of the Maquis until after
Dukat was kidnapped.

231
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,439
I want a complete list
of every weapon she purchased.

232
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,441
Of course,
and if you need someone

233
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,359
to testify against Sakonna
in court,

234
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:59,279
I'd be more than willing.
Would you?

235
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,489
In a second, and let me know

236
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,075
if there's anyone else
who needs testifying against.

237
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,993
I'll tell you one thing,
Commander.

238
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,329
Sakonna was on a tight clock.

239
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,206
Whatever she needed
those weapons for,

240
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,959
it's going to happen
within the next few days.

241
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,419
Just get me the list.

242
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,463
Sir, I assume
you'll be going out

243
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,172
to search
for Dukat again.

244
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,007
As soon as O'Brien
tells us where to look.

245
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,968
As Chief of Security,
I'd like to go along.

246
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,137
I'll be happy
to have you along.

247
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:28,767
And one other thing--
how long do I keep him here?

248
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,393
Forever.

249
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,440
Odo...

250
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,401
This isn't funny.

251
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,153
Odo!

252
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,613
This is Legate Parn.

253
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,406
He insisted on
seeing you immediately.

254
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,659
Because my business
here is crucial,

255
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,077
it demands
immediate attention.

256
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,497
And as a member of
the Cardassian Central Command,

257
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,290
I must assure you, Commander,

258
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,543
that what we have to discuss
is most crucial, indeed.

259
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,962
I understand.
I assure you

260
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,632
we are doing everything we can
to find Gul Dukat.

261
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:03,009
Please, Commander,
your efforts
are appreciated

262
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,803
but unnecessary.

263
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:07,888
You see, Central Command
has learned that Gul Dukat

264
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,351
was the leader of a small group
of misguided officers

265
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,645
who were funneling
weapons to our colonies

266
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,438
in the Demilitarized Zone.

267
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,524
Then the Maquis
were right.

268
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,234
The Cardassian settlers
are being supplied
by Central Command.

269
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:24,905
Dukat and the others
were operating entirely
without our knowledge.

270
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,367
Central Command would
never sanction anything

271
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,869
that would
violate our treaty
with the Federation.

272
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:35,041
We've arrested
Dukat's co-conspirators

273
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,418
and they shall be
dealt with accordingly.

274
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,961
Where does that
leave Dukat?

275
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,798
With the Maquis,
where he belongs.

276
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,342
Are you saying
you don't want him back?

277
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,387
I assume the Maquis
will execute him
for his crimes.

278
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,055
I wouldn't
be surprised.

279
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,765
Well, then I don't see
what difference it makes

280
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,809
whether we do it
or they do it.

281
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,935
How do we know
they won't use Dukat's death

282
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,104
as an excuse to send troops
into the Demilitarized Zone?

283
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,815
I can assure
you, Commander,

284
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,900
that there shall
be no retaliation.

285
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:08,658
The Cardassians have no
desire to go to war again
with the Federation.

286
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,411
You have my word.
Your word.

287
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,079
Major.

288
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,832
I found our little
talk very enlightening.

289
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:18,501
I hoped you would.
Unfortunately,

290
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,378
I have some business
to attend to,

291
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,255
but I do hope you'll
take the time

292
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,840
to enjoy the station.

293
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,425
Thank you, Commander,

294
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,802
but I, too,
must attend to my business.

295
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:38,938
Besides, I am afraid
this place has lost its charm

296
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,148
since the last time
I was here.

297
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,657
I don't believe
a word he said.

298
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:52,076
Neither do I.
But he did tell me
something

299
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:55,329
that I needed to know.
Cal was right.

300
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,791
The Central Command
<i>is</i> smuggling weapons

301
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,167
into the Demilitarized Zone.

302
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:11,679
We just received a report
that three Federation settlers

303
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,347
were killed on Hakton VII.

304
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,683
The Cardassians claim
it was in response

305
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,644
to the destruction
of the<i> Bok'nor.</i>

306
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,813
Which gives the Maquis
a new excuse to strike back.

307
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,022
Chief, what have
you found?

308
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,692
Based on the residual
subspace distortion
of their warp drive,

309
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:29,238
I was able to plot the course
of the Maquis ship
that took Dukat.

310
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,616
As you can see,
long-range sensors
show no signs

311
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,785
of any other vessels
traveling along that route.

312
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,370
All right, they didn't transfer
him to another ship.

313
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,706
What about a planet?
It's possible.

314
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:41,542
Their course took them
past five M-Class planets.

315
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:44,838
I've downloaded
their coordinates into
the<i> Rio Grande's</i> computer.

316
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,422
Good work.

317
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,508
Sisko to Odo.
ODO: Yes, Commander.

318
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,927
Find Dr. Bashir
and meet me immediately
at Landing Pad C.

319
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,929
On our way.
Commander,

320
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,889
you know
there's no reason
to go after Dukat.

321
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,308
You heard Legate Parn.
They don't want him back.

322
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,477
Are you suggesting
we leave him to the Maquis?

323
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,731
Why risk our lives over someone
who's caused so many deaths?

324
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,734
The way I see it,
he's getting exactly
what he deserves.

325
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,823
The Central Command
wants him dead.

326
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,367
That's reason enough
for us to want him alive.

327
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,285
Landing Pad C.

328
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:30,257
My mind to your mind.

329
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:34,512
Your thoughts to my thoughts.

330
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:38,808
My mind to your mind.

331
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:42,729
Your thoughts to my thoughts.

332
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:47,191
My mind to your mind...

333
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:50,028
MAN:
What is wrong?

334
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,946
It's not working.

335
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,615
That is what's wrong.

336
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,911
This is quite puzzling.

337
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,747
I am unable to establish
a mind-meld.

338
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,249
It would appear
he has the ability

339
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,626
to shield his thoughts.

340
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,712
Simply a matter of discipline.

341
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,589
<i>Now</i> what do we do?

342
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,173
I will rest awhile

343
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,926
and then I will try again.

344
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,635
(<i> Dukat chuckles</i> )

345
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:17,847
You people really do not
do this very well, do you?

346
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:22,226
Now, on Cardassia
we know how to
extract information,

347
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:25,479
though it can get
a bit... unpleasant

348
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:29,859
and we all know
how the Federation
dislikes unpleasantness.

349
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:32,653
I share very few sentiments
with the Federation.

350
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:37,658
Ooh, that's right.
You're renegades,
aren't you?

351
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,744
(<i> laughing</i> )

352
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,162
Or so you'd like to think.

353
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:46,793
Unfortunately, the Federation
has taught you your lessons
all too well.

354
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:53,299
You simply lack
the commitment it takes
to do what is necessary.

355
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,094
You tell that to the crew
of the<i> Bok'nor.</i>

356
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,680
Oh, anyone
can blow up a ship.

357
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,515
(<i> derisive laugh</i> )

358
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,602
But to look your enemy
in the eye

359
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,562
knowing you'll
remember his face

360
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,481
for the rest
of your life,

361
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,441
now, that takes...

362
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:16,823
a stomach much stronger
than you'll ever have.

363
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,616
We'll see
about that.

364
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,200
No.

365
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,245
He's right.
We do not possess

366
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,248
the Cardassian gift
for inflicting pain.

367
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,708
(<i> laughing</i> )

368
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,418
There. You see?

369
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,921
Nor would we want
such a gift.

370
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,381
But we do need to know
when the Central Command

371
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,968
is sending
its next weapons shipment.

372
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,846
So, if it's all the same
to you, Sakonna,

373
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,181
I'll take over
this interrogation.

374
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:45,101
Then we can find out
just how committed I am.

375
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,812
SISKO: I don't think
anyone's that interested.

376
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,564
Put down your weapons.
We're not here to fight you.

377
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,650
If that is true, then you will
let us go about our business.

378
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,194
I'm not leaving
without Dukat.
Then you're not leaving.

379
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,446
BASHIR:
Look, we're all on
the same side here.

380
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:00,282
We all want to stop
the arms shipments.
Why not work together?

381
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,494
Will you stop talking
and shoot them?

382
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,621
No, that's not
what we want.

383
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,331
What are you waiting for?

384
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,208
Put down your weapons.

385
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,335
ODO:
Do as he says.

386
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,295
Shoot them!

387
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:21,679
(<i> yells</i> )

388
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,851
(<i> groans</i> )

389
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,025
(<i> yelling</i> )

390
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,572
Let him go!

391
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,574
I said let him go!

392
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,951
Odo, get these people
secured on the runabout.

393
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,370
With pleasure, Commander.
Except this one.

394
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,040
You mean I'm free to go?

395
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,792
Tell Cal Hudson
I haven't told Starfleet
anything yet.

396
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:56,422
Tell him, we can still
solve this thing together,
but we're running out of time.

397
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:59,759
Tell him, I still
have his uniform.

398
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,302
He can have it back
anytime he wants.

399
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,621
Ah.

400
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,546
(<i> door chimes</i> )

401
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,006
Enter.

402
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,677
I just came by to see
how you were doing.

403
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:47,556
I find a good meal
extremely relaxing,

404
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,600
especially
after a difficult day.

405
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,351
So do I.
Really?

406
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,605
I wonder what else
we have in common.

407
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,941
Very little, I imagine.

408
00:21:56,983 --> 00:22:00,027
(<i> laughing</i> )
Other than the fact

409
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,362
that you have my office.

410
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:12,331
Tell me,
what's going to happen
with your prisoners?

411
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,041
They'll be tried
for their crimes

412
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,210
under the Federation
Code of Justice.

413
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,337
And if they're
found innocent?

414
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,757
I doubt that they will,
but if they are,
they'll be set free.

415
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:26,386
How barbaric. In Cardassia,
the verdict is always known

416
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:29,849
before the trial begins,
and it's always the same.

417
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,101
In that case, why bother
with a trial at all?

418
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:35,771
Because the people demand it.

419
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:42,736
They enjoy watching justice
triumph over evil every time.

420
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,198
They find it
comforting.

421
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:48,868
Isn't there ever a chance
you might try an innocent man
by mistake?

422
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:52,079
Cardassians don't
make mistakes.

423
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,498
I'll have to remember that.

424
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,046
Commander...

425
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,634
one thing does puzzle me.

426
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:09,972
Surely the Central Command
was informed of my kidnapping.

427
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:12,474
They learned about it
almost as soon as it happened.

428
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,144
Then why was I
rescued by you?

429
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:20,900
Why wasn't the station
surrounded by Cardassian ships
demanding my release?

430
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:24,611
We did receive a visit
from Legate Parn.

431
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:28,949
Ah! I'm sure he made some rather
ugly threats on my behalf, hmm?

432
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,785
He said that you
were the one responsible

433
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:35,122
for smuggling weapons
into the Demilitarized Zone.

434
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:37,375
That if the Maquis
did not execute you,

435
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,252
then the Central
Command would...

436
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:43,130
after a comforting trial,
I'm sure.

437
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,635
(<i> sighing</i> )

438
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,430
Well...

439
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:56,310
it seems my relationship
with the Central Command

440
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,271
has somewhat deteriorated.

441
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:03,984
I knew this was inevitable
the moment we withdrew
from Bajor.

442
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:06,695
Are you saying
they blamed you
for the withdrawal?

443
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,698
Ha! There are those
who believe

444
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:14,578
I should have killed
every last Bajoran
while I had the chance.

445
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,790
Oh, well.

446
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,793
It's too late for that,
I'm afraid.

447
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,795
Commander,
it seems I was mis...

448
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,880
Mistaken about
the arms shipment?

449
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:31,095
It appears
I was misinformed.

450
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:35,641
I'm beginning to believe
the Central Command
is indeed smuggling weapons

451
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:39,228
into the Demilitarized Zone
after all.

452
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,855
Then you really
didn't know, did you?

453
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,441
No.

454
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,445
They never bothered
to tell me.

455
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:55,577
If I help you
stop the smuggling,

456
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,789
will you help me
stop the Maquis?

457
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:06,255
You have a deal.

458
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,426
I've scheduled
a staff meeting for 0900.

459
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:12,261
I'll be there.
Commander...

460
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:17,975
thank you for coming
to my rescue.

461
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,894
I'm sure you would have done
the same for me.

462
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,276
(<i> chuckles</i> )

463
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,494
(<i> sighs</i> )

464
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:41,832
Constable, do you have
the list of weapons
Sakonna bought from Quark?

465
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:44,542
I do, and quite a list it is.

466
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:47,587
Six ship-mounted
high-energy disrupters,

467
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,383
three particle accelerators,
200 photon torpedoes,

468
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,343
and a dozen pulse cannons.

469
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:54,887
With that kind of firepower,
the Bajorans could have launched

470
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,847
a full-scale assault
on Cardassia.

471
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,932
And lost.

472
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,185
Sounds like the Maquis
have had their fill
of border skirmishes.

473
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:03,896
They're ready for
something bigger.
According to Quark,

474
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,106
they're planning their
first attack any day now.

475
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:08,359
Have you been able to make
any headway with Sakonna?

476
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:11,404
Have you ever tried
to interrogate a Vulcan,
Lieutenant?

477
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,780
No.
Neither had I,
until today.

478
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,533
I wouldn't advise it.

479
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:18,494
That calm, measured voice
that tells you nothing,

480
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:21,497
that impassive stare--
it can be quite frustrating.

481
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:24,041
Perhaps I could
question her.

482
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,501
I don't think so.

483
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:27,503
Pity.
I like a challenge.

484
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:30,130
You want a challenge?
Find out how
the Central Command

485
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,550
is getting weapons into
the Demilitarized Zone.

486
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,928
My guess would be by way
of a Xepolite free trader.

487
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,637
Why the Xepolites?

488
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,181
Because the Xepolites
have often served

489
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:41,183
as intermediaries for us
in the past.

490
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:42,851
So have the Lissepians.

491
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:47,022
Ah, but the Xepolites
have never been caught.

492
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,864
The Xepolite ship isn't
responding to our hails, sir.

493
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:58,492
DUKAT: Of course
they're not responding.
Would you respond

494
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:02,162
to a Federation hail
if your cargo bays were
full of Cardassian weapons?

495
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,831
Scan their ship, Major.
Let's see what
they're carrying.

496
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,960
Our scanners can't
penetrate their hull.

497
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,711
O'BRIEN:
No wonder.

498
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,922
It's composed of
a sensor-reflective material.

499
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,007
They obviously value
their privacy.

500
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,427
Chief, you and Gul
Dukat remain here.

501
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:18,011
Major, you're with me.

502
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,846
Let's go see
if it's their privacy

503
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,557
or their guilt they're
trying to protect.

504
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,601
Sorry, Commander,
you can't transport over.

505
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,352
They just raised
their shields.

506
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,980
You're wasting time.

507
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:31,733
Xepolite ships can reach
a maximum speed of warp 9.8.

508
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:34,027
If they decide to run,
we'll never catch them.

509
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,653
Well, what would
you suggest?

510
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,990
I would breach their shields
with my phasers

511
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,117
and destroy their bridge.
Killing everyone there.

512
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,496
That's correct.
Then I would lock onto
the ship with my tractor beam

513
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:45,872
and tow it, and its cargo,
back to the station.

514
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,583
Very simple, very effective.

515
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,293
And needlessly bloody.

516
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:51,878
Sounds like a Cardassian
plan to me.

517
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,131
Chief, fire a phaser
over their bow.

518
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,799
Let's see if we can
get their attention.

519
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,551
Yes, sir.

520
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,514
(<i> console beeping</i> )

521
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:03,974
That woke them up.
They're hailing us.

522
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,268
On my monitor, Chief.

523
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:09,355
I am Drofo Awa,
Hetman of this vessel.

524
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,440
What do you want from us?

525
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:12,941
I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko

526
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:15,110
of the United Federation
of Planets.

527
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:16,945
We believe you're carrying
Cardassian weapons

528
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:19,198
to their colonies
in the Demilitarized Zone.

529
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:23,243
Well, then, you believe wrong,
Commander.

530
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:26,246
My ship is carrying
five kilotons

531
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:29,041
of Regrean wheat husks,
nothing more.

532
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:32,044
Five kilotons--
that's a lot of wheat husks.

533
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:35,673
With your permission,
I'd like to come aboard
and see what that looks like.

534
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,508
Permission denied.

535
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:40,135
And if there's any attempt
to board my vessel,

536
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:43,805
I will consider it an act
of piracy. Is that clear?

537
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,765
You can call it
anything you like,

538
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:48,310
but you're not going anywhere
until we search your ship.

539
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:50,020
In that case, Commander...

540
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:54,066
In that case, you will do
exactly as you're told.

541
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,569
You will allow us
free access to your ship

542
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,654
so that we can verify
you are indeed smuggling

543
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:01,073
Cardassian weapons
into the Demilitarized Zone.

544
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,742
You will then follow us back
to Deep Space 9

545
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:06,161
where your cargo
will be confiscated

546
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:09,248
and you will make
a full confession
detailing everything you know

547
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,251
about smuggling weapons
into the Demilitarized Zone.

548
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,920
Then you will sign
that confession,

549
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:18,131
after which,
you and your ship will be
allowed on your way.

550
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,759
Is that clear?
I don't understand.

551
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,135
You're a Cardassian.

552
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:26,139
I'm not just
any Cardassian.

553
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,435
I'm Gul Dukat, Commander
of the Second Order.

554
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:33,689
You have 15 seconds
to lower your shields
or we'll destroy you.

555
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:35,524
No, wait!
Ten seconds.

556
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:37,568
No, it's not that simple!
Seven seconds.

557
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,778
I've already been paid!
Four seconds.

558
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,531
Stop counting!
Stop counting!

559
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:44,824
He's lowering
his shields.

560
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,999
I'll await your arrival,
Commander.

561
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,588
I think you can
handle it from here.

562
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,488
I hope you're happy.

563
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,616
I am a Vulcan.
My emotional state
is irrelevant.

564
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:29,620
Well, I'm a Ferengi,
and my emotional state
is very relevant,

565
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:31,705
and right now,
I'm miserable,

566
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,999
and it's all your fault.

567
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,376
You were well paid
for your assistance.

568
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,128
Not well enough.

569
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,256
Look, I know the Cardassians
can't be trusted.

570
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,719
I know the Central Command
would like nothing better

571
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:49,222
than to destroy
the Federation colonies
in the Demilitarized Zone.

572
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,475
Then you agree
with our position?

573
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,519
Not for a second.
Why not?

574
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,855
Because your position
is illogical.

575
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:59,899
Do you propose
to lecture<i> me</i> on logic?

576
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:04,112
I don't want to, but
you leave me no choice.

577
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,494
It all comes down
to the Third Rule
of Acquisition.

578
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:12,871
You don't know
that one, do you?

579
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:15,582
I am not well-versed
in Ferengi philosophy.

580
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,250
Remind me to give you
a copy of the Rules.

581
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,712
You never know when
they'll come in handy.

582
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:23,674
Now, the Third Rule
clearly states

583
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:26,218
"Never spend more
for an acquisition

584
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,761
than you have to."

585
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,929
Logical,
but I fail to see

586
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,057
how that applies
to my situation.

587
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:35,268
You want to acquire peace.

588
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,230
Fine. Peace is good.

589
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:42,067
But how much are you
willing to pay for it?
Whatever it costs.

590
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,236
That's the kind of
irresponsible spending

591
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:46,071
that causes so many
business ventures to fail.

592
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,906
You're forgetting
the Third Rule.

593
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:51,326
Right now, peace
could be bought
at a bargain price

594
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:53,662
and you don't
even realize it.

595
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:55,914
I find this
very confusing.

596
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,916
(<i> sighs</i> )

597
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,293
Then I'll make it so simple

598
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:03,171
that even a Vulcan
can understand.

599
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:06,675
The Central Command has
been caught red-handed

600
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:08,968
smuggling weapons
to their settlers.

601
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,555
So, every ship
that approaches the
Demilitarized Zone

602
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:13,390
will be searched.

603
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:16,142
Without the support
of the Central Command,

604
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,562
the Cardassian settlers
won't be so eager to fight.

605
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:21,398
You forget the weapons
they already have.

606
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,318
They have weapons.
You have weapons.

607
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,531
Everyone has weapons,
but right now, no one
has a clear advantage.

608
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:33,786
So, the price of peace
is at an all-time low.

609
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:36,747
This is the perfect time
to sit down

610
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:40,834
and hammer out an agreement.
Don't you get it?

611
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:44,671
Attacking the Cardassians now
will only escalate the conflict

612
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:48,467
and make peace more expensive
in the long run.

613
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,889
Now, I ask you,
is that logical?

614
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,101
A concealed weapons depot

615
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:01,688
located within
a civilian population center?

616
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,524
According to Sakonna,
the Maquis are going
to attack the depot

617
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:06,860
sometime within
the next 52 hours.

618
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:10,405
But she didn't tell you
on which colony
the depot is hidden.

619
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,991
She says she doesn't know.
How convenient.

620
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,952
I believe her.
Why?

621
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,996
Because Vulcans don't lie?
As a rule, they don't.

622
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:20,707
They don't blow up
ships either, as a rule.

623
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:24,294
But let's assume she's
telling the truth.

624
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:27,881
I take it you haven't
shared this information
with the Central Command?

625
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,716
No, I haven't.
Good.

626
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:31,259
Because they
would never trust you

627
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:32,928
to handle
this matter alone.

628
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,596
But they would be able

629
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:36,556
to tell me where
the weapons depot is located.

630
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,642
Leave that to me.

631
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:42,270
I may no longer
be a favorite with
Central Command,

632
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,523
but I know
people who are.

633
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,485
In the meantime,
I'll go to Volon III

634
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,236
and try to talk some sense
into the Maquis.

635
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:53,365
And if you can't?
Don't worry, Dukat.

636
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:58,411
I said I would stop the Maquis,
and, one way or another, I will.

637
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:14,720
I've also
been recently informed

638
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,972
that 35 people
had to be hospitalized

639
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:21,142
on Umoth VIII after eating
from public food replicators.

640
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,728
Sabotage is suspected.

641
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,855
Then from now on,
guards should be posted

642
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:27,024
at all public replicators
throughout the colonies.

643
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,859
Thank you.

644
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:30,610
Now, about the new curfew...

645
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,612
(<i> door opens</i> )

646
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:35,824
Commander Sisko,
what a pleasant surprise.

647
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:39,411
If you'll just wait a moment,
I'll finish up this meeting
and we can talk privately.

648
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:44,708
That won't be necessary.
I want everyone to hear
what I have to say.

649
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,376
I don't know
how many of you here

650
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,628
actually belong
to the Maquis.

651
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:52,173
Those of you who don't
probably have friends who do.

652
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:55,385
So, please make sure
you pass along

653
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,220
what I'm about to tell you.

654
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,931
There is a treaty
currently in place

655
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:00,640
with Cardassia
and the Federation.

656
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:03,476
If you make yourself
an enemy of Cardassia,

657
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,104
you make yourself an enemy
of the Federation.

658
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:09,524
That is outrageous.
Agreed.

659
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:13,779
I know the Maquis
is planning to attack
a Cardassian weapons depot.

660
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:18,241
My advice to them and to you
is to call it off,

661
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:22,203
because I'll be waiting there,
and I<i> will</i> stop you.

662
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,956
(<i> door opens</i> )

663
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:32,965
A very rousing speech, Ben.

664
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:36,342
I suppose my best rebuttal
would be to kill you.

665
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,095
But you won't.

666
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,642
What is this?

667
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,769
Your uniform.

668
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:48,146
You always were an optimist.

669
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,065
I have every
reason to be.

670
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:52,692
The way I see it,
now that we've stopped

671
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,736
the shipments
of Cardassian weapons,

672
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:57,739
there's no longer any need
for the Maquis.

673
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:01,576
You and I can work together
to reach a peace agreement

674
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:03,578
with the Cardassian colonies.

675
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,622
It's too late for that.

676
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,206
Is it?

677
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:10,961
We're in a war here,
and I intend to win it.

678
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:13,672
I could use
your help, Ben,

679
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,466
and I'm asking you as a friend.

680
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,217
As a friend...

681
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:22,305
I have to say no.

682
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:25,391
If you attack
the depot,

683
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:28,520
you'll have
to get through me first.

684
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:32,482
I hope not.
I truly hope not.

685
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,893
The Bryma colony--
according to my sources,

686
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,936
that's the location
of the weapons depot.

687
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:11,980
SISKO:
Then our objective
is simple--

688
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:14,399
prevent the Maquis ships
from reaching Bryma.

689
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,401
We're going
to have to intercept them

690
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,820
before they're picked up
by the colony's sensors.
Good point.

691
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:21,614
If the Cardassian settlers
even suspect they might
come under attack,

692
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,367
they'll send a message
to Cardassia asking
for reinforcements.

693
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,828
I don't care how much
the Cardassians care
about the treaty,

694
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,497
if the Maquis launch an assault
against a civilian target,

695
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,457
the Central Command
will have to respond.

696
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,127
We could wind up with
a full-scale war on our hands.

697
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:37,589
We have to stop the Maquis.

698
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,008
Our runabouts will take up
a defensive position

699
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,594
just outside the Bryma
colony's sensor range.

700
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,763
The best way to
detect incoming ships

701
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,472
would be to hide
a couple dozen sensor probes

702
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,100
in the system's Oort cloud.

703
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:49,809
That way,
we could spot the Maquis

704
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,436
no matter what route they take.

705
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,105
How many Maquis ships
are we expecting?

706
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:54,856
According to Sakonna,
they only have two ships

707
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,649
capable of mounting
the weapons she purchased.

708
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,610
So, we'll have three ships,
and they'll have two.

709
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,361
The odds are in
our favor, anyway.

710
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,781
That won't
give us much of an
advantage, Julian.

711
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,991
The colonists are used
to being outnumbered.

712
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,202
They'll fight just
that much harder.

713
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:08,870
How do you propose
to stop them?

714
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:10,914
What's that human expression?

715
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:12,540
"Shoot to kill."

716
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:15,043
SISKO:
We'll try to stop
them with words,

717
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:18,004
if possible;
with force, if necessary.

718
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,339
So, if they fire at us,
we have orders
to shoot back.

719
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:24,343
That's correct.
We'll target their warp engines
and weapons arrays--

720
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,471
try to disable them.
DUKAT: How noble.

721
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:30,016
I hope the Maquis will be
as obliging to you.

722
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:39,234
<i>Rio Grande</i> to
<i>Mekong</i> and<i> Orinoco.</i>
How do you read me?

723
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:41,278
<i>Orinoco</i> here.
You're loud and clear.

724
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,113
<i>Mekong</i> here.
Our communications channel

725
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:45,573
is fully operational
and secure.

726
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:47,909
The remote sensor
probes I set up

727
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:50,411
still haven't detected
any sign of the Maquis ships.

728
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,289
Do you really think
they're coming?

729
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,291
They know we're waiting
for them, after all.

730
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,584
It's possible they changed
the time frame of their attack--

731
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:57,836
postponed it
a day or a week.

732
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,587
SISKO:
They'll be here.

733
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,673
The longer they wait,
the greater the chance

734
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,425
the weapons depot will be
moved to another location.

735
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,604
O'BRIEN:
Commander, I'm picking up

736
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,982
two Federation ships
headed our way.

737
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:21,026
Sisko to Hudson.

738
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,569
This isn't going
to work, Cal.

739
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,364
Turn those ships around
before someone gets hurt.

740
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:30,618
Please, Ben,
don't make me open fire on you.

741
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,207
He's not going to listen.

742
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:37,500
Initiating
evasive maneuvers.

743
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,627
Signal Niles to
follow my lead.

744
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,129
Right.

745
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:51,890
Commander, they're
making a run for it.

746
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,892
Lock on tractor beams.

747
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,938
Damn it!

748
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,481
They've got Niles, too.

749
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:02,984
Let us go, Ben.

750
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:05,070
You know I can't do that.

751
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,445
Then I suggest you duck.

752
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,824
Fire on their beam emitter.

753
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,746
(<i> console beeping</i>
<i>insistently</i> )

754
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,124
What are you
waiting for?

755
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,667
O'BRIEN:
We're losing tractor lock.

756
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:21,211
KIRA:
They're breaking away.

757
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:22,879
Commence firing.

758
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:29,552
Niles' propulsion system
is down.

759
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:30,887
He's drifting.

760
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,597
We'll have to
even the odds.

761
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,771
They've hit
our navigational array.

762
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:42,857
I've lost attitude control.

763
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,984
Attempting to compensate
with manual thrusters.

764
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,945
KIRA: It's not working.
Thrusters are still locked.

765
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:50,198
Hang on. Chief,
you go after
the<i> Orinoco.</i>

766
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,367
I'll handle Hudson.
O'BRIEN: Right.

767
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:54,160
Major.
Yes, Chief?

768
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:56,121
Lower your shields.
We'll beam you
out of there.

769
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:58,456
They're coming back around.

770
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,625
(<i> console beeping</i> )

771
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,961
It's just you and me, Ben.

772
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,963
I can't let you start a war.

773
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,048
I'm not turning back.

774
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,800
And you're not going forward.

775
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,726
We're hit.

776
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:20,228
Our photon torpedo tubes
are out.

777
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,729
Switch to phasers.

778
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:26,567
Come about, heading
115 mark 326.

779
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,902
Got it.

780
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:41,624
We've taken a direct hit
on our primary fusion core.

781
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:44,043
Initiating emergency
core shutdown.

782
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:47,630
The port nacelle is flooded
with ionized deuterium.

783
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:50,633
We've lost both warp
and impulse engines.

784
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:53,136
We still have
maneuvering thrusters.

785
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,808
They're coming back around.
Use the phasers.

786
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,478
I can't.
They've knocked out
the power couplings

787
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,604
to our weapons array.

788
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,690
What do we do?

789
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,275
The only thing we can do.

790
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:09,694
We get the hell out of here.

791
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:16,075
He's turning away.
Now's your chance-- fire.

792
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:18,077
It's over, Cal.

793
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,455
For now, anyway.
Next time,

794
00:42:20,497 --> 00:42:22,540
tell Starfleet
to send someone else.

795
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,501
It doesn't feel right, you and I
shooting at each other.

796
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,878
There won't be a next time.
Stand down!

797
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,838
I don't think so, Ben.

798
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,423
He's getting away!

799
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,925
You run now,
I won't be able to protect you.

800
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:36,179
Starfleet will track you down.
You won't be safe anywhere--

801
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:37,805
not even in the colonies.

802
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:40,350
Don't be so sure. I have
a lot of friends here.

803
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:44,145
Besides, I've got to help
the Maquis finish this thing.

804
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:46,523
You'll be an outlaw--
a hunted man.

805
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,107
Maybe.

806
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,984
You're throwing away
your entire life.

807
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:52,028
And beginning a new one.

808
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,072
What are you
waiting for?

809
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,533
He's helpless.
Finish him.

810
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,035
I'm going to miss you, Ben.

811
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:01,287
You've been a good friend.

812
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,753
So have you.

813
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:10,213
No!

814
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:18,096
I thought you were strong,
Commander.

815
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,889
You're not.

816
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:21,807
You're a fool.

817
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,976
A sentimental fool.

818
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,438
I said I'd stop the
Maquis, and I have,

819
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:30,567
but I will not
kill a good man
for defending his home.

820
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,944
You disappoint me.

821
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:35,905
Don't expect me to lose
any sleep over it.

822
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,990
Mr. O'Brien,
when you get a chance,

823
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,867
I could use some help
with these engines.

824
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:41,327
Yes, sir.

825
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:52,297
Commander, Gul Dukat
has left the station.

826
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,715
I'm sure he's glad
to be going home.

827
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:57,135
Chief O'Brien says
that the<i> Orinoco</i>
and the<i> Rio Grande</i>

828
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,137
will be up and running
in a few days.

829
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,805
Thank you, Major.

830
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:03,558
I just got
a communiqué
from Starfleet

831
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,977
congratulating me
on my good work

832
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:09,897
and thanking me for preserving
the peace with the Cardassians.

833
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:12,108
You deserve it.

834
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,901
You prevented a war.

835
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:16,279
Did I?

836
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:19,865
Or did I just
delay the inevitable?
