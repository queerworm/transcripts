1
00:00:03,866 --> 00:00:05,426
Last time on <i>Deep Space Nine...</i>

2
00:00:05,469 --> 00:00:08,669
A number of Admirals
at Starfleet Command are worried

3
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:11,179
the destruction of the <i>Bok'nor</i>
might jeopardize the treaty.

4
00:00:11,247 --> 00:00:12,510
Oh, are they really?

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,488
As the two ranking officers
along the Cardassian border

6
00:00:15,523 --> 00:00:18,393
we've been asked to assess
the potential risk.

7
00:00:18,428 --> 00:00:20,125
I wish to procure weapons.

8
00:00:20,165 --> 00:00:22,192
I beg your pardon?

9
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:25,207
Guns, phaser banks,
photon torpedoes...

10
00:00:25,242 --> 00:00:27,576
- Shh.
...troop transports

11
00:00:27,614 --> 00:00:30,518
and a number
of cobalt-thorium devices.

12
00:00:30,553 --> 00:00:31,851
You're a gun runner?

13
00:00:31,889 --> 00:00:33,221
I'm here unofficially

14
00:00:33,258 --> 00:00:36,196
to help you find out
the truth about the <i>Bok'nor.</i>

15
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,698
Why would you want to help me?

16
00:00:37,734 --> 00:00:39,966
Because I already know
the truth.

17
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:42,498
I've got people out there
killing people, Major.

18
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:44,104
You suggest I turn
a blind eye to that?

19
00:00:44,146 --> 00:00:45,843
They don't have a right
to defend themselves?

20
00:00:45,883 --> 00:00:47,010
They've crossed the line!

21
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:49,079
If Starfleet is unwilling
to defend their people...

22
00:00:49,123 --> 00:00:50,752
They chose to live
with the Cardassians!

23
00:00:50,793 --> 00:00:51,818
Well, I didn't!

24
00:00:51,862 --> 00:00:53,627
But I lived with them
for 26 years

25
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,134
before the liberation came.

26
00:00:55,168 --> 00:00:57,434
Every Bajoran lived with them
in constant fear.

27
00:00:57,473 --> 00:00:59,739
I know what those colonists
are going through.

28
00:01:04,453 --> 00:01:06,981
We just received
a general subspace transmission

29
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,688
from somewhere
in the Demilitarized Zone.

30
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:11,222
A group there is taking credit
for the kidnapping of Dukat.

31
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,133
They're calling themselves...

32
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:15,107
"the Maquis."

33
00:01:18,949 --> 00:01:23,253
I'm glad to see you had
no trouble finding us, Ben.

34
00:01:23,358 --> 00:01:26,626
It seems that one disaster
after another

35
00:01:26,665 --> 00:01:29,762
keeps bringing us
back together again.

36
00:01:29,805 --> 00:01:32,333
And now, for the conclusion.

37
00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:44,594
You should have seen
the look on your face

38
00:01:44,634 --> 00:01:47,504
when you saw me
standing there, Ben.

39
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:51,536
I hardly recognized you
without your uniform.

40
00:01:51,581 --> 00:01:55,020
Well, it's been feeling
a little tight lately.

41
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,858
Just like that.

42
00:01:57,894 --> 00:01:59,830
It's just a uniform, Ben.

43
00:01:59,865 --> 00:02:01,494
Is that all it is?

44
00:02:01,534 --> 00:02:03,663
I remember
when you first put it on.

45
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,678
Yes... graduation day
at the Academy.

46
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:10,151
We both swore
that we'd be starship captains

47
00:02:10,185 --> 00:02:12,553
by the time we were 30.

48
00:02:12,589 --> 00:02:14,616
And admirals by 40.

49
00:02:14,661 --> 00:02:15,993
Yes.

50
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,196
I think we've both done
pretty well for ourselves.

51
00:02:19,236 --> 00:02:21,399
Yes, we have, haven't we?

52
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,412
But now,
I've got something better.

53
00:02:24,446 --> 00:02:26,075
These settlers, Ben...

54
00:02:26,117 --> 00:02:29,283
if you saw all they
have accomplished

55
00:02:29,323 --> 00:02:32,318
without any help
from the Federation

56
00:02:32,429 --> 00:02:35,230
then you'd fight
along with them.

57
00:02:35,268 --> 00:02:37,261
I don't think so.

58
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:44,512
They've traveled out here
to the back of the beyond

59
00:02:44,553 --> 00:02:46,750
and built homes
out of the wilderness.

60
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,921
Now, maybe the Federation
can turn their backs on them

61
00:02:48,963 --> 00:02:50,192
but I can't.

62
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:51,358
I'm not asking you to

63
00:02:51,434 --> 00:02:54,133
but your joining the Maquis
isn't helping anyone.

64
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,643
Your actions have only
endangered the treaty

65
00:02:56,678 --> 00:02:58,614
and put millions
of lives at risk.

66
00:02:58,648 --> 00:03:01,176
The Federation believes
that it can solve

67
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,092
every problem with a treaty,
but out here, on the frontier

68
00:03:05,128 --> 00:03:07,964
without the power of the
Federation to back them up

69
00:03:08,001 --> 00:03:10,666
a treaty is only
a piece of paper.

70
00:03:10,706 --> 00:03:11,833
Do you have evidence

71
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,711
that the Central Command
has violated the treaty?

72
00:03:14,748 --> 00:03:16,114
Not yet, but we will.

73
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,448
If you're depending

74
00:03:17,486 --> 00:03:19,888
on Gul Dukat for proof,
you're going to be disappointed.

75
00:03:19,924 --> 00:03:21,689
We'll find out, won't we?

76
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,891
I want him back, Cal.

77
00:03:23,932 --> 00:03:25,868
He's not here.

78
00:03:25,903 --> 00:03:28,032
Then where is he?

79
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:30,476
I never thought I'd see the day

80
00:03:30,512 --> 00:03:34,577
when you'd side with a
Cardassian against me.

81
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,020
Damn it, Cal, I'm on your side.

82
00:03:36,057 --> 00:03:38,050
You've got a funny way
of showing it, Ben.

83
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:39,494
I'm trying to stop you
from making

84
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,261
one of the biggest
mistakes of your life.

85
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,894
The Federation
believes in the treaty.

86
00:03:42,937 --> 00:03:46,103
If you destroy it,
Starfleet will come after you

87
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:49,309
and they won't be satisfied
until you're behind bars.

88
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:52,719
If we work together
to end the violence...

89
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:55,888
The violence will never end
as long as Central Command

90
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,663
continues to smuggle weapons
to their colonies.

91
00:03:58,701 --> 00:04:01,571
I wish there were a better way
to handle this thing.

92
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:02,597
I really do.

93
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:05,273
Nobody wants peace
any more than the Maquis.

94
00:04:05,315 --> 00:04:06,374
And you're willing

95
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,386
to blow up Cardassian ships
to get it?

96
00:04:08,421 --> 00:04:11,052
The <i>Bok'nor</i> will never
smuggle weapons again.

97
00:04:11,093 --> 00:04:12,220
And its crew members

98
00:04:12,262 --> 00:04:14,425
won't be returning home
to their families either.

99
00:04:16,604 --> 00:04:18,836
Look, you say
the Central Command

100
00:04:18,876 --> 00:04:20,105
is behind the smuggling.

101
00:04:20,145 --> 00:04:21,238
Fine, let's prove it.

102
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,407
How?

103
00:04:22,516 --> 00:04:24,247
We'll go to Cardassia,
find the evidence

104
00:04:24,286 --> 00:04:25,584
you need to back up your claim

105
00:04:25,622 --> 00:04:27,819
and when we do, we'll
take it to the Federation.

106
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,094
No, the Federation abandoned us.

107
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:33,569
Told us to take care
of ourselves.

108
00:04:33,604 --> 00:04:35,938
Well, that's what we
intend to do, Ben

109
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:39,437
but you...
you could be invaluable to us.

110
00:04:39,516 --> 00:04:40,950
Let us use your station.

111
00:04:40,986 --> 00:04:42,454
For what?

112
00:04:42,489 --> 00:04:44,220
A maintenance facility
for our ships.

113
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:45,888
I can't allow that.

114
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,870
Every week, innocent people
are murdered by the Cardassians.

115
00:04:49,904 --> 00:04:53,399
I will not allow those deaths
to go unpunished.

116
00:04:53,444 --> 00:04:55,937
You don't want peace, Cal.

117
00:04:55,983 --> 00:04:58,044
You want revenge.

118
00:05:00,993 --> 00:05:04,694
I prefer to call it retaliation.

119
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:07,967
I am sorry we won't be
working together, Benjamin.

120
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:10,808
It would have been nice.

121
00:05:13,017 --> 00:05:16,821
Like... old times.

122
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:26,705
Commander!

123
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,373
Sorry, Benjamin.

124
00:05:28,414 --> 00:05:30,907
No!

125
00:05:30,953 --> 00:05:31,921
Okay, let's go.

126
00:05:31,955 --> 00:05:33,150
Knowing Ben's temper

127
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,821
when he wakes up,
we won't want to be here.

128
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:37,354
Come on, let's move out.

129
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:39,198
Come on, here we go.

130
00:05:39,236 --> 00:05:40,899
Let's go, come on.

131
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:50,848
Lieutenant, I want to speak

132
00:07:50,884 --> 00:07:52,786
with the Cardassian
Central Command.

133
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:54,289
Then you're in luck.

134
00:07:54,325 --> 00:07:56,853
Legate Parn will be arriving
within the hour.

135
00:07:56,896 --> 00:07:58,798
A Legate?
I feel honored.

136
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,769
While I'm waiting,
I want to speak with Starfleet.

137
00:08:00,804 --> 00:08:03,001
Admiral Necheyev's already here.

138
00:08:05,847 --> 00:08:08,410
Chief, the Maquis must have
transferred Dukat off their ship

139
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:09,921
before they reached
that asteroid.

140
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:11,754
I want to know
where they've hid him.

141
00:08:11,793 --> 00:08:13,125
I can retrace their warp trail.

142
00:08:13,163 --> 00:08:14,860
See if they met up
with any other ships.

143
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:16,128
Do it.

144
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:19,434
Admiral.

145
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:21,535
Commander, the Cardassian
Central Command

146
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:22,877
has gone on military alert

147
00:08:22,915 --> 00:08:25,351
in response to the kidnapping
of Gul Dukat.

148
00:08:25,387 --> 00:08:26,548
I'm not surprised.

149
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,823
This Security Chief of yours,
this shape-shifter...

150
00:08:29,862 --> 00:08:31,422
- Odo.
- Odo.

151
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:33,436
Are you sure you
wouldn't be better off

152
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,135
with a Starfleet officer
heading your security team?

153
00:08:36,175 --> 00:08:38,703
Admiral, I have complete faith
in Odo's ability to do his job.

154
00:08:38,747 --> 00:08:39,942
If you say so, Commander.

155
00:08:39,982 --> 00:08:41,143
I do.

156
00:08:41,185 --> 00:08:43,052
And as for Gul Dukat,
I assure you

157
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,993
we are taking all possible
steps to locate him.

158
00:08:46,028 --> 00:08:48,430
Good. Keep me informed
of your progress.

159
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:49,491
I will.

160
00:08:49,602 --> 00:08:50,900
But, Admiral

161
00:08:50,937 --> 00:08:53,305
there is a bigger issue
here than rescuing Dukat.

162
00:08:53,343 --> 00:08:54,834
And what is that?

163
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,177
The Maquis.

164
00:08:56,215 --> 00:09:00,178
The Maquis are a bunch
of irresponsible hotheads.

165
00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:02,922
These hotheads are responsible
for the bombing of the <i>Bok'nor.</i>

166
00:09:02,961 --> 00:09:04,224
I'm aware of that, Commander.

167
00:09:04,265 --> 00:09:07,237
We never should have allowed
those colonists to remain

168
00:09:07,271 --> 00:09:08,934
on the Cardassian side
of the Demilitarized Zone.

169
00:09:08,973 --> 00:09:11,307
Well, they're there, Admiral,
and they're not leaving.

170
00:09:11,345 --> 00:09:13,076
What about Commander Hudson?

171
00:09:13,116 --> 00:09:14,949
He's lived with these people.

172
00:09:14,985 --> 00:09:16,283
What's his analysis
of the situation?

173
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:19,055
I'll... have to ask him.

174
00:09:20,497 --> 00:09:22,296
You do that.

175
00:09:24,405 --> 00:09:27,866
And Commander,
I want you to find the Maquis.

176
00:09:27,911 --> 00:09:29,038
Talk to them.

177
00:09:29,081 --> 00:09:30,744
Remind them

178
00:09:30,784 --> 00:09:32,515
that they're citizens
of the Federation.

179
00:09:32,588 --> 00:09:34,285
That it is imperative
that we preserve

180
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:35,759
the treaty with the Cardassians.

181
00:09:35,794 --> 00:09:37,821
A treaty the Cardassians
may not be honoring.

182
00:09:37,865 --> 00:09:40,632
Are you questioning
Federation policy, Commander?

183
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,799
All I know
is that the situation

184
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:46,109
in the Demilitarized Zone
is deteriorating rapidly.

185
00:09:46,148 --> 00:09:49,713
Personally, I think you're
overstating the problem.

186
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,189
Establish a dialogue
with the Maquis.

187
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:53,354
They're still
Federation citizens.

188
00:09:53,396 --> 00:09:55,730
I'm sure
they'll listen to reason.

189
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:57,258
Good luck, Commander.

190
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:00,367
"Establish a dialogue."

191
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,812
What the hell does she think
I've been trying to do?

192
00:10:02,848 --> 00:10:03,816
Commander.

193
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,079
Just because a group of people

194
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,919
belong to the Federation
that does not mean

195
00:10:06,956 --> 00:10:07,924
that they are saints.

196
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:08,926
Excuse me.

197
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,189
Do you know
what the trouble is?!

198
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,198
No.

199
00:10:11,232 --> 00:10:12,758
The trouble is Earth.

200
00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:13,860
Really?

201
00:10:13,903 --> 00:10:17,502
On Earth, there is no poverty,
no crime, no war.

202
00:10:17,544 --> 00:10:20,107
You look out the window
of Starfleet headquarters

203
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,277
and you see paradise.

204
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:23,255
Well, it's easy to be a saint

205
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,920
in paradise,
but the Maquis do not live

206
00:10:25,961 --> 00:10:27,760
in paradise.

207
00:10:27,798 --> 00:10:29,631
Out there,
in the Demilitarized Zone

208
00:10:29,735 --> 00:10:31,967
all the problems
haven't been solved yet.

209
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:35,605
Out there, there are no saints,
just people...

210
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,981
angry, scared, determined people

211
00:10:38,018 --> 00:10:40,352
who are going to do
whatever it takes to survive

212
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,123
whether it meets with the
Federation's approval or not.

213
00:10:43,162 --> 00:10:45,064
Makes sense to me.

214
00:10:47,704 --> 00:10:51,143
Well, I'm glad
someone understands.

215
00:10:51,178 --> 00:10:54,879
Legate Parn's ship just put in
at Docking Bay 5.

216
00:10:54,918 --> 00:10:58,449
Maybe you'd like to give
the same speech to him.

217
00:10:58,493 --> 00:11:01,192
I just might do that.

218
00:11:01,232 --> 00:11:02,861
Odo to Sisko.

219
00:11:02,901 --> 00:11:04,369
Go ahead, Constable.

220
00:11:04,405 --> 00:11:06,272
I think you'd better
get down to Security.

221
00:11:06,308 --> 00:11:08,801
I've caught one
of the Vulcan's accomplices.

222
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,617
I assure you, I had no idea

223
00:11:12,654 --> 00:11:15,285
Sakonna was planning
to kidnap Gul Dukat.

224
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:16,760
Really?

225
00:11:16,796 --> 00:11:19,164
Then perhaps you could explain
why the two of you

226
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:20,932
were spending
so much time together.

227
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,498
Surely it's no crime

228
00:11:23,543 --> 00:11:25,672
keeping company
with a beautiful female.

229
00:11:25,714 --> 00:11:27,046
You ought to try it, Odo.

230
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,916
It might improve
your disposition.

231
00:11:28,953 --> 00:11:30,421
Do you expect us to believe

232
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:32,324
that a Vulcan
would be interested in you

233
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,555
for your lobes?

234
00:11:33,596 --> 00:11:37,400
Vulcans are a species
that appreciate good ears.

235
00:11:37,437 --> 00:11:41,537
Commander,
this is very embarrassing

236
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:44,710
having to discuss my personal
life in such surroundings.

237
00:11:44,785 --> 00:11:47,450
Embarrassment is going to be
the least of your problems

238
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:50,019
unless you tell me what kind
of business arrangement

239
00:11:50,062 --> 00:11:51,257
you had with this woman.

240
00:11:51,298 --> 00:11:55,568
All right, but first
I want to make it clear

241
00:11:55,607 --> 00:11:58,477
that I was led astray
by Sakonna's feminine wiles.

242
00:11:58,513 --> 00:12:00,346
Save the excuses, Quark.

243
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,580
Just tell us
what you were up to.

244
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,559
Sakonna was in the market
for certain items

245
00:12:05,593 --> 00:12:07,495
which I was able to obtain.

246
00:12:07,531 --> 00:12:10,298
At a considerable discount,
I might add.

247
00:12:10,336 --> 00:12:11,999
What items?

248
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,316
We're waiting.

249
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,090
Let's see... where to begin?

250
00:12:22,126 --> 00:12:25,223
She wanted
some deflector shields

251
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:27,099
navigational arrays

252
00:12:27,136 --> 00:12:31,304
maybe a couple hundred
photon torpedoes...

253
00:12:31,345 --> 00:12:33,474
Photon torpedoes!

254
00:12:33,516 --> 00:12:35,577
And pulse cannons

255
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,715
and some high-energy disrupters.

256
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,250
Weapons! You sold weapons
to a terrorist group.

257
00:12:40,296 --> 00:12:41,662
I did not.

258
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:44,101
The Pygorians
sold them the weapons.

259
00:12:44,136 --> 00:12:47,597
I merely...
made some introductions.

260
00:12:47,644 --> 00:12:49,637
Besides, I hadn't even heard
of the Maquis

261
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:51,241
until after Dukat was kidnapped.

262
00:12:51,285 --> 00:12:55,282
I want a complete list
of every weapon she purchased.

263
00:12:55,326 --> 00:12:56,760
Of course,
and if you need someone

264
00:12:56,795 --> 00:12:58,321
to testify against Sakonna
in court

265
00:12:58,366 --> 00:13:00,097
I'd be more than willing.

266
00:13:00,135 --> 00:13:01,160
Would you?

267
00:13:01,204 --> 00:13:03,174
In a second, and let me know

268
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:06,442
if there's anyone else
who needs testifying against.

269
00:13:06,482 --> 00:13:08,315
I'll tell you one thing,
Commander.

270
00:13:08,352 --> 00:13:09,912
Sakonna was on a tight clock.

271
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,152
Whatever she needed
those weapons for

272
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:14,959
it's going to happen
within the next few days.

273
00:13:14,998 --> 00:13:16,524
Just get me the list.

274
00:13:16,568 --> 00:13:18,561
Sir, I assume
you'll be going out

275
00:13:18,606 --> 00:13:20,166
to search for Dukat again.

276
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,075
As soon as O'Brien
tells us where to look.

277
00:13:22,112 --> 00:13:24,082
As Chief of Security,
I'd like to go along.

278
00:13:24,116 --> 00:13:26,052
I'll be happy to have you along.

279
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:30,620
And one other thing...
how long do I keep him here?

280
00:13:30,663 --> 00:13:32,257
Forever.

281
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:36,900
Odo...

282
00:13:37,978 --> 00:13:40,346
This isn't funny.

283
00:13:40,383 --> 00:13:42,046
Odo!

284
00:13:42,086 --> 00:13:43,577
This is Legate Parn.

285
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,524
He insisted
on seeing you immediately.

286
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,257
Because my business
here is crucial

287
00:13:47,296 --> 00:13:49,727
it demands immediate attention.

288
00:13:49,861 --> 00:13:52,560
And as a member of the
Cardassian Central Command

289
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,229
I must assure you, Commander

290
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:57,174
that what we have to discuss
is most crucial, indeed.

291
00:13:57,209 --> 00:13:58,677
I understand.

292
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,648
I assure you
we are doing everything we can

293
00:14:00,683 --> 00:14:02,015
to find Gul Dukat.

294
00:14:02,052 --> 00:14:04,522
Please, Commander,
your efforts are appreciated

295
00:14:04,558 --> 00:14:06,289
but unnecessary.

296
00:14:06,327 --> 00:14:09,561
You see, Central Command
has learned that Gul Dukat

297
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:13,005
was the leader of a small group
of misguided officers

298
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,569
who were funneling
weapons to our colonies

299
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:17,412
in the Demilitarized Zone.

300
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:19,077
Then the Maquis were right.

301
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:20,816
The Cardassian settlers
are being supplied

302
00:14:20,857 --> 00:14:21,984
by Central Command.

303
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:23,084
Dukat and the others

304
00:14:23,127 --> 00:14:25,655
were operating entirely
without our knowledge.

305
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,193
Central Command would
never sanction anything

306
00:14:28,238 --> 00:14:31,369
that would violate our treaty
with the Federation.

307
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:36,317
We've arrested
Dukat's coconspirators

308
00:14:36,354 --> 00:14:38,985
and they shall be
dealt with accordingly.

309
00:14:39,026 --> 00:14:40,859
Where does that leave Dukat?

310
00:14:40,897 --> 00:14:43,333
With the Maquis,
where he belongs.

311
00:14:43,368 --> 00:14:45,896
Are you saying
you don't want him back?

312
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,471
I assume the Maquis
will execute him for his crimes.

313
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:50,641
I wouldn't be surprised.

314
00:14:50,683 --> 00:14:52,209
Well, then I don't see
what difference it makes

315
00:14:52,252 --> 00:14:54,586
whether we do it
or they do it.

316
00:14:54,624 --> 00:14:56,423
How do we know
they won't use Dukat's death

317
00:14:56,461 --> 00:14:58,897
as an excuse to send troops
into the Demilitarized Zone?

318
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:00,299
I can assure you, Commander

319
00:15:00,335 --> 00:15:02,362
that there shall
be no retaliation.

320
00:15:06,548 --> 00:15:09,748
The Cardassians have no
desire to go to war again

321
00:15:09,788 --> 00:15:11,256
with the Federation.

322
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,553
You have my word.

323
00:15:12,593 --> 00:15:13,720
Your word.

324
00:15:13,762 --> 00:15:15,230
Major.

325
00:15:15,265 --> 00:15:17,565
I found our little
talk very enlightening.

326
00:15:17,603 --> 00:15:20,096
I hoped you would.

327
00:15:20,141 --> 00:15:22,202
Unfortunately, I have
some business to attend to

328
00:15:22,245 --> 00:15:24,112
but I do hope
you'll take the time

329
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:25,617
to enjoy the station.

330
00:15:25,653 --> 00:15:27,144
Thank you, Commander

331
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:30,025
but I, too,
must attend to my business.

332
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,978
Besides, I am afraid
this place has lost its charm

333
00:15:41,017 --> 00:15:43,989
since the last time I was here.

334
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:50,893
I don't believe a word he said.

335
00:15:50,936 --> 00:15:52,427
Neither do I.

336
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:56,004
But he did tell me something
that I needed to know.

337
00:15:56,047 --> 00:15:57,538
Cal was right.

338
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,282
The Central Command
is smuggling weapons

339
00:16:00,321 --> 00:16:02,587
into the Demilitarized Zone.

340
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:11,909
We just received a report

341
00:16:11,945 --> 00:16:15,145
that three Federation settlers
were killed on Hakton VII.

342
00:16:15,185 --> 00:16:17,451
The Cardassians claim
it was in response

343
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,392
to the destruction
of the <i>Bok'nor.</i>

344
00:16:19,426 --> 00:16:21,989
Which gives the Maquis
a new excuse to strike back.

345
00:16:22,032 --> 00:16:23,295
Chief, what have you found?

346
00:16:23,334 --> 00:16:25,361
Based on the residual
subspace distortion

347
00:16:25,405 --> 00:16:28,707
of their warp drive,
I was able to plot the course

348
00:16:28,745 --> 00:16:31,045
of the Maquis ship
that took Dukat.

349
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,643
As you can see,
long-range sensors

350
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:34,247
show no signs
of any other vessels

351
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:35,552
traveling along that route.

352
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:38,223
All right, they didn't transfer
him to another ship.

353
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:39,732
What about a planet?

354
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:41,167
It's possible.

355
00:16:41,203 --> 00:16:43,366
Their course took them
past five M-Class planets.

356
00:16:43,407 --> 00:16:45,274
I've downloaded
their coordinates

357
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,008
into the <i>Rio Grande's</i> computer.

358
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,175
Good work.

359
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:49,378
Sisko to Odo.

360
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:50,444
Yes, Commander.

361
00:16:50,488 --> 00:16:51,547
Find Dr. Bashir

362
00:16:51,591 --> 00:16:53,220
and meet me immediately
at Landing Pad C.

363
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:54,229
On our way.

364
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,754
Commander, you know
there's no reason

365
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:56,767
to go after Dukat.

366
00:16:56,801 --> 00:16:57,962
I mean, you heard Legate Parn.

367
00:16:58,004 --> 00:16:59,029
They don't want him back.

368
00:16:59,072 --> 00:17:01,304
Are you suggesting
we leave him to the Maquis?

369
00:17:01,343 --> 00:17:05,408
Why risk our lives over someone
who's caused so many deaths?

370
00:17:05,451 --> 00:17:06,419
The way I see it

371
00:17:06,453 --> 00:17:08,389
he's getting exactly
what he deserves.

372
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,491
The Central Command
wants him dead.

373
00:17:13,535 --> 00:17:16,530
That's reason enough
for us to want him alive.

374
00:17:16,575 --> 00:17:18,066
Landing Pad C.

375
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:31,898
My mind to your mind.

376
00:17:31,938 --> 00:17:36,140
Your thoughts to my thoughts.

377
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,781
My mind to your mind.

378
00:17:40,823 --> 00:17:44,422
Your thoughts to my thoughts.

379
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:48,961
My mind to your mind...

380
00:17:49,006 --> 00:17:51,876
What is wrong?

381
00:17:51,911 --> 00:17:53,813
It's not working.

382
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:56,285
That is what's wrong.

383
00:17:57,957 --> 00:17:59,654
This is quite puzzling.

384
00:17:59,727 --> 00:18:02,426
I am unable to establish
a mind-meld.

385
00:18:02,465 --> 00:18:04,993
It would appear
he has the ability

386
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:07,338
to shield his thoughts.

387
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,504
Simply a matter of discipline.

388
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,311
Now what do we do?

389
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:15,085
I will rest awhile
and then I will try again.

390
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,725
You people really do not
do this very well, do you?

391
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:24,140
Now, on Cardassia, we know
how to extract information

392
00:18:24,176 --> 00:18:27,342
though it can get
a bit... unpleasant

393
00:18:27,382 --> 00:18:30,548
and we all know
how the Federation

394
00:18:30,588 --> 00:18:32,421
dislikes unpleasantness.

395
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:34,827
I share very few sentiments
with the Federation.

396
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,663
Ooh, that's right.

397
00:18:36,768 --> 00:18:39,604
You're renegades,
aren't you?

398
00:18:41,543 --> 00:18:44,140
Or so you'd like to think.

399
00:18:44,182 --> 00:18:46,049
Unfortunately, the Federation

400
00:18:46,086 --> 00:18:48,683
has taught you your lessons
all too well.

401
00:18:48,725 --> 00:18:52,688
You simply lack
the commitment it takes

402
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:55,226
to do what is necessary.

403
00:18:55,271 --> 00:18:58,972
You tell that to the crew
of the <i>Bok'nor.</i>

404
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,380
Oh, anyone can blow up a ship.

405
00:19:03,287 --> 00:19:06,623
But to look your enemy
in the eye

406
00:19:06,661 --> 00:19:08,654
knowing you'll
remember his face

407
00:19:08,765 --> 00:19:14,106
for the rest of your life,
now, that takes...

408
00:19:14,142 --> 00:19:18,880
a stomach much stronger
than you'll ever have.

409
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:20,616
We'll see about that.

410
00:19:20,655 --> 00:19:22,123
No.

411
00:19:22,158 --> 00:19:23,456
He's right.

412
00:19:23,494 --> 00:19:24,928
We do not possess

413
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:28,130
the Cardassian gift
for inflicting pain.

414
00:19:29,841 --> 00:19:31,674
There. You see?

415
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,908
Nor would we want such a gift.

416
00:19:33,949 --> 00:19:36,978
But we do need to know
when the Central Command

417
00:19:37,021 --> 00:19:39,389
is sending
its next weapons shipment.

418
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:41,919
So, if it's all the same
to you, Sakonna

419
00:19:41,965 --> 00:19:44,094
I'll take over
this interrogation.

420
00:19:44,135 --> 00:19:46,834
Then we can find out
just how committed I am.

421
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,870
I don't think
anyone's that interested.

422
00:19:49,914 --> 00:19:51,041
Put down your weapons.

423
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,551
We're not here to fight you.

424
00:19:52,585 --> 00:19:54,714
If that is true, then you will
let us go about our business.

425
00:19:54,757 --> 00:19:56,556
I'm not leaving without Dukat.

426
00:19:56,593 --> 00:19:57,754
Then you're not leaving.

427
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,459
Look, we're all
on the same side here.

428
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:01,230
We all want to stop
the arms shipments.

429
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,260
Why not work together?

430
00:20:02,305 --> 00:20:06,177
Will you stop talking
and shoot them?

431
00:20:06,213 --> 00:20:07,579
No, that's not what we want.

432
00:20:07,615 --> 00:20:09,244
What are you waiting for?

433
00:20:09,286 --> 00:20:11,188
Put down your weapons.

434
00:20:11,223 --> 00:20:12,796
Do as he says.

435
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:14,660
Shoot them!

436
00:20:39,649 --> 00:20:41,015
Let him go!

437
00:20:41,052 --> 00:20:42,452
I said let him go!

438
00:20:42,488 --> 00:20:45,255
Odo, get these people
secured on the runabout.

439
00:20:45,294 --> 00:20:46,489
With pleasure, Commander.

440
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:47,827
Except this one.

441
00:20:47,866 --> 00:20:49,665
You mean I'm free to go?

442
00:20:49,702 --> 00:20:51,501
Tell Cal Hudson

443
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:53,236
I haven't told Starfleet
anything yet.

444
00:20:53,276 --> 00:20:54,608
Tell him, we can still

445
00:20:54,645 --> 00:20:57,913
solve this thing together,
but we're running out of time.

446
00:20:57,953 --> 00:21:00,652
Tell him, I still
have his uniform.

447
00:21:00,691 --> 00:21:03,686
He can have it back
anytime he wants.

448
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:30,907
Ah.

449
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:40,469
Enter.

450
00:21:42,274 --> 00:21:45,839
I just came by to see
how you were doing.

451
00:21:45,882 --> 00:21:49,116
I find a good meal
extremely relaxing

452
00:21:49,155 --> 00:21:51,091
especially
after a difficult day.

453
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,958
- So do I.
- Really?

454
00:21:52,996 --> 00:21:56,127
I wonder what else
we have in common.

455
00:21:56,169 --> 00:21:58,435
Very little, I imagine.

456
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:03,849
Other than the fact
that you have my office.

457
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:13,324
Tell me, what's going to happen
with your prisoners?

458
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:15,601
They'll be tried
for their crimes

459
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,906
under the Federation
Code of Justice.

460
00:22:17,946 --> 00:22:19,813
And if they're found innocent?

461
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:20,977
I doubt that they will

462
00:22:21,018 --> 00:22:23,284
but, if they are,
they'll be set free.

463
00:22:23,323 --> 00:22:24,621
How barbaric.

464
00:22:24,658 --> 00:22:27,926
In Cardassia,
the verdict is always known

465
00:22:27,966 --> 00:22:29,868
before the trial begins

466
00:22:29,903 --> 00:22:31,394
and it's always the same.

467
00:22:31,472 --> 00:22:33,669
In that case, why bother
with a trial at all?

468
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:37,149
Because the people demand it.

469
00:22:37,184 --> 00:22:44,290
They enjoy watching justice
triumph over evil every time.

470
00:22:44,331 --> 00:22:46,130
They find it comforting.

471
00:22:46,169 --> 00:22:47,968
Isn't there ever a chance

472
00:22:48,006 --> 00:22:50,442
you might try
an innocent man by mistake?

473
00:22:50,544 --> 00:22:53,710
Cardassians don't make mistakes.

474
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,016
I'll have to remember that.

475
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,957
Commander...

476
00:23:03,904 --> 00:23:07,605
one thing does puzzle me.

477
00:23:07,644 --> 00:23:11,641
Surely the Central Command
was informed of my kidnapping.

478
00:23:11,686 --> 00:23:15,125
They learned about it
almost as soon as it happened.

479
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,426
Then why was I rescued by you?

480
00:23:17,464 --> 00:23:20,995
Why wasn't the station
surrounded by Cardassian ships

481
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:22,529
demanding my release?

482
00:23:22,574 --> 00:23:26,275
We did receive a visit
from Legate Parn.

483
00:23:26,315 --> 00:23:30,653
Ah! I'm sure he made some rather
ugly threats on my behalf, hmm?

484
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,389
He said that you
were the one responsible

485
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:36,765
for smuggling weapons
into the Demilitarized Zone.

486
00:23:36,802 --> 00:23:39,204
That if the Maquis
did not execute you

487
00:23:39,241 --> 00:23:41,006
then the Central Command
would...

488
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:44,644
after a comforting trial,
I'm sure.

489
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,799
Well...

490
00:23:53,836 --> 00:23:57,936
it seems my relationship
with the Central Command

491
00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:00,279
has somewhat deteriorated.

492
00:24:00,317 --> 00:24:02,617
I knew this was inevitable

493
00:24:02,654 --> 00:24:05,592
the moment we withdrew
from Bajor.

494
00:24:05,627 --> 00:24:08,394
Are you saying they blamed you
for the withdrawal?

495
00:24:08,433 --> 00:24:11,633
Ha! There are those who believe

496
00:24:11,672 --> 00:24:15,442
I should have killed
every last Bajoran

497
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,473
while I had the chance.

498
00:24:17,517 --> 00:24:19,384
Oh, well.

499
00:24:19,421 --> 00:24:22,484
It's too late for that,
I'm afraid.

500
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,929
Commander, it seems I was mis...

501
00:24:24,966 --> 00:24:28,963
Mistaken
about the arms shipment?

502
00:24:29,007 --> 00:24:31,500
It appears I was misinformed.

503
00:24:31,612 --> 00:24:33,741
I'm beginning to believe

504
00:24:33,783 --> 00:24:37,883
the Central Command
is indeed smuggling weapons

505
00:24:37,924 --> 00:24:41,260
into the Demilitarized Zone
after all.

506
00:24:41,298 --> 00:24:43,768
Then you really
didn't know, did you?

507
00:24:43,803 --> 00:24:44,896
No.

508
00:24:46,575 --> 00:24:49,240
They never bothered to tell me.

509
00:24:53,956 --> 00:24:57,053
If I help you stop the smuggling

510
00:24:57,097 --> 00:25:00,365
will you help me
stop the Maquis?

511
00:25:06,415 --> 00:25:09,751
You have a deal.

512
00:25:09,788 --> 00:25:12,351
I've scheduled
a staff meeting for 0900.

513
00:25:12,394 --> 00:25:13,657
I'll be there.

514
00:25:13,696 --> 00:25:17,191
Commander... thank you

515
00:25:17,237 --> 00:25:19,800
for coming to my rescue.

516
00:25:19,842 --> 00:25:23,008
I'm sure you would have done
the same for me.

517
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,752
Constable, do you have
the list of weapons

518
00:25:42,787 --> 00:25:44,313
Sakonna bought from Quark?

519
00:25:44,358 --> 00:25:46,828
I do, and quite a list it is.

520
00:25:46,862 --> 00:25:49,264
Six ship-mounted
high-energy disrupters

521
00:25:49,301 --> 00:25:52,364
three particle accelerators,
200 photon torpedoes

522
00:25:52,407 --> 00:25:54,070
and a dozen pulse cannons.

523
00:25:54,111 --> 00:25:55,443
With that kind of firepower

524
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,971
the Bajorans
could have launched

525
00:25:57,016 --> 00:25:58,610
a full-scale assault
on Cardassia.

526
00:25:58,653 --> 00:25:59,780
And lost.

527
00:25:59,821 --> 00:26:02,121
Sounds like the Maquis
have had their fill

528
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,128
of border skirmishes.

529
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:04,722
They're ready
for something bigger.

530
00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:05,733
According to Quark

531
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:07,862
they're planning
their first attack any day now.

532
00:26:07,904 --> 00:26:10,705
Have you been able to make
any headway with Sakonna?

533
00:26:10,743 --> 00:26:11,711
Have you ever tried

534
00:26:11,745 --> 00:26:13,236
to interrogate a Vulcan,
Lieutenant?

535
00:26:13,282 --> 00:26:14,250
No.

536
00:26:14,284 --> 00:26:15,547
Well, neither had I,
until today.

537
00:26:15,587 --> 00:26:17,055
I wouldn't advise it.

538
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:20,119
That calm, measured voice
that tells you nothing

539
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:21,860
that impassive stare...

540
00:26:21,899 --> 00:26:23,698
it can be quite frustrating.

541
00:26:23,736 --> 00:26:25,831
Perhaps I could question her.

542
00:26:25,873 --> 00:26:27,000
I don't think so.

543
00:26:27,042 --> 00:26:28,169
Pity.

544
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:29,441
I like a challenge.

545
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:30,471
You want a challenge?

546
00:26:30,516 --> 00:26:32,042
Find out how the Central Command

547
00:26:32,086 --> 00:26:34,352
is getting weapons
into the Demilitarized Zone.

548
00:26:34,391 --> 00:26:37,625
My guess would be by way
of a Xepolite free trader.

549
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:39,530
Why the Xepolites?

550
00:26:39,568 --> 00:26:41,265
Because the Xepolites
have often served

551
00:26:41,305 --> 00:26:42,934
as intermediaries for us
in the past.

552
00:26:42,974 --> 00:26:45,571
So have the Lissepians.

553
00:26:45,613 --> 00:26:48,744
Ah, but the Xepolites
have never been caught.

554
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,793
The Xepolite ship isn't
responding to our hails, sir.

555
00:26:57,837 --> 00:26:59,305
Of course
they're not responding.

556
00:26:59,341 --> 00:27:01,675
Would you respond
to a Federation hail

557
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:04,147
if your cargo bays
were full of Cardassian weapons?

558
00:27:04,184 --> 00:27:05,243
Scan their ship, Major.

559
00:27:05,286 --> 00:27:06,777
Let's see what they're carrying.

560
00:27:06,822 --> 00:27:09,623
Our scanners can't
penetrate their hull.

561
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:10,914
No wonder.

562
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:13,678
It's composed of
a sensor-reflective material.

563
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,883
They obviously value
their privacy.

564
00:27:15,924 --> 00:27:18,258
Chief, you and Gul
Dukat remain here.

565
00:27:18,296 --> 00:27:19,856
Major, you're with me.

566
00:27:19,898 --> 00:27:21,332
Let's go see
if it's their privacy

567
00:27:21,369 --> 00:27:23,202
or their guilt,
they're trying to protect.

568
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:25,141
Sorry, Commander,
you can't transport over.

569
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:26,508
They just raised their shields.

570
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:29,142
You're wasting time.

571
00:27:29,184 --> 00:27:32,783
Xepolite ships can reach
a maximum speed of warp 9.8.

572
00:27:32,824 --> 00:27:35,317
If they decide to run,
we'll never catch them.

573
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:36,695
Well, what would you suggest?

574
00:27:36,732 --> 00:27:38,793
I would breach their shields
with my phasers

575
00:27:38,836 --> 00:27:39,997
and destroy their Bridge.

576
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:41,132
Killing everyone there.

577
00:27:41,175 --> 00:27:42,404
That's correct.

578
00:27:42,444 --> 00:27:45,143
Then I would lock onto the ship
with my tractor beam

579
00:27:45,183 --> 00:27:47,016
and tow it, and its cargo,
back to the station.

580
00:27:47,086 --> 00:27:48,783
Very simple, very effective.

581
00:27:48,823 --> 00:27:50,452
And needlessly bloody.

582
00:27:50,493 --> 00:27:53,021
Sounds like a Cardassian
plan to me.

583
00:27:53,098 --> 00:27:54,863
Chief, fire a phaser
over their bow.

584
00:27:54,902 --> 00:27:57,270
Let's see if we can
get their attention.

585
00:27:57,307 --> 00:27:58,639
Yes, sir.

586
00:28:02,684 --> 00:28:04,152
That woke them up.

587
00:28:04,188 --> 00:28:05,156
They're hailing us.

588
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,490
On my monitor, Chief.

589
00:28:07,527 --> 00:28:10,590
I am Drofo Awa,
Hetman of this vessel.

590
00:28:10,633 --> 00:28:12,694
What do you want from us?

591
00:28:12,737 --> 00:28:14,137
I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko

592
00:28:14,173 --> 00:28:16,109
of the United Federation
of Planets.

593
00:28:16,144 --> 00:28:18,171
We believe you're carrying
Cardassian weapons

594
00:28:18,216 --> 00:28:20,345
to their colonies
in the Demilitarized Zone.

595
00:28:20,386 --> 00:28:24,417
Well, then, you believe wrong,
Commander.

596
00:28:24,461 --> 00:28:26,328
My ship is carrying

597
00:28:26,365 --> 00:28:30,328
five kilotons of Regrean
wheat husks, nothing more.

598
00:28:30,373 --> 00:28:33,368
Five kilotons...
that's a lot of wheat husks.

599
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:35,541
With your permission,
I'd like to come aboard

600
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:36,881
and see what that looks like.

601
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:38,353
Permission denied.

602
00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:41,054
And if there's any attempt
to board my vessel

603
00:28:41,161 --> 00:28:43,563
I will consider it
an act of piracy.

604
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,067
Is that clear?

605
00:28:45,102 --> 00:28:46,628
You can call it
anything you like

606
00:28:46,672 --> 00:28:49,371
but you're not going anywhere
until we search your ship.

607
00:28:49,411 --> 00:28:51,040
In that case, Commander...

608
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,180
In that case, you will do
exactly as you're told.

609
00:28:55,222 --> 00:28:57,819
You will allow us
free access to your ship

610
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,455
so that we can verify
you are indeed smuggling

611
00:28:59,498 --> 00:29:02,334
Cardassian weapons
into the Demilitarized Zone.

612
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:05,035
You will then follow us back
to Deep Space 9

613
00:29:05,142 --> 00:29:07,044
where your cargo
will be confiscated

614
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,912
and you will make
a full confession

615
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,476
detailing everything you know

616
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,888
about smuggling weapons
into the Demilitarized Zone.

617
00:29:12,924 --> 00:29:15,190
Then you will sign
that confession

618
00:29:15,229 --> 00:29:19,499
after which, you and your ship
will be allowed on your way.

619
00:29:19,538 --> 00:29:20,699
Is that clear?

620
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,403
I don't understand.

621
00:29:22,444 --> 00:29:24,175
You're a Cardassian.

622
00:29:24,213 --> 00:29:27,310
I'm not just any Cardassian.

623
00:29:27,354 --> 00:29:30,793
I'm Gul Dukat, Commander
of the Second Order.

624
00:29:30,827 --> 00:29:33,765
You have 15 seconds
to lower your shields

625
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:34,960
or we'll destroy you.

626
00:29:35,002 --> 00:29:35,992
No, wait!

627
00:29:36,037 --> 00:29:37,005
Ten seconds.

628
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,029
No, it's not that simple!

629
00:29:38,074 --> 00:29:39,042
Seven seconds.

630
00:29:39,076 --> 00:29:40,305
I've already been paid!

631
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:41,837
Four seconds.

632
00:29:41,882 --> 00:29:43,852
Stop counting!
Stop counting!

633
00:29:43,886 --> 00:29:46,049
He's lowering his shields.

634
00:29:51,669 --> 00:29:55,302
I'll await your arrival,
Commander.

635
00:29:55,343 --> 00:29:58,804
I think you can
handle it from here.

636
00:30:21,829 --> 00:30:23,958
I hope you're happy.

637
00:30:23,999 --> 00:30:25,058
I am a Vulcan.

638
00:30:25,102 --> 00:30:26,833
My emotional state
is irrelevant.

639
00:30:26,872 --> 00:30:28,170
Well, I'm a Ferengi

640
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:30,975
and my emotional state
is very relevant

641
00:30:31,013 --> 00:30:33,006
and right now, I'm miserable

642
00:30:33,051 --> 00:30:34,953
and it's all your fault.

643
00:30:34,988 --> 00:30:38,154
You were well paid
for your assistance.

644
00:30:38,194 --> 00:30:39,526
Not well enough.

645
00:30:39,564 --> 00:30:44,438
Look, I know the Cardassians
can't be trusted.

646
00:30:44,474 --> 00:30:46,603
I know the Central Command
would like nothing better

647
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:48,239
than to destroy
the Federation colonies

648
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:50,183
in the Demilitarized Zone.

649
00:30:50,218 --> 00:30:52,245
Then you agree
with our position?

650
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:53,655
Not for a second.

651
00:30:53,692 --> 00:30:54,990
Why not?

652
00:30:55,028 --> 00:30:58,228
Because your position
is illogical.

653
00:30:58,268 --> 00:31:01,240
Do you propose
to lecture me on logic?

654
00:31:01,274 --> 00:31:07,344
I don't want to,
but you leave me no choice.

655
00:31:07,387 --> 00:31:09,016
It all comes down

656
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,926
to the Third Rule
of Acquisition.

657
00:31:11,962 --> 00:31:14,398
You don't know that one, do you?

658
00:31:14,434 --> 00:31:17,804
I am not well-versed
in Ferengi philosophy.

659
00:31:17,841 --> 00:31:19,504
Remind me to give you
a copy of the Rules.

660
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,241
You never know
when they'll come in handy.

661
00:31:21,314 --> 00:31:25,084
Now, the Third Rule
clearly states

662
00:31:25,121 --> 00:31:27,614
"Never spend more
for an acquisition

663
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,630
than you have to."

664
00:31:29,664 --> 00:31:31,258
Logical, but I fail to see

665
00:31:31,334 --> 00:31:33,429
how that applies
to my situation.

666
00:31:33,472 --> 00:31:36,672
You want to acquire peace.

667
00:31:36,712 --> 00:31:39,205
Fine. Peace is good

668
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:42,086
but how much are you
willing to pay for it?

669
00:31:42,122 --> 00:31:43,590
Whatever it costs.

670
00:31:43,626 --> 00:31:45,755
That's the kind
of irresponsible spending

671
00:31:45,796 --> 00:31:48,266
that causes so many
business ventures to fail.

672
00:31:48,301 --> 00:31:49,998
You're forgetting
the Third Rule.

673
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:53,010
Right now, peace could be bought
at a bargain price

674
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:54,946
and you don't even realize it.

675
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:57,281
I find this very confusing.

676
00:31:59,424 --> 00:32:01,724
Then I'll make it so simple

677
00:32:01,762 --> 00:32:04,632
that even a Vulcan
can understand.

678
00:32:04,668 --> 00:32:08,038
The Central Command has
been caught red-handed

679
00:32:08,074 --> 00:32:09,873
smuggling weapons
to their settlers.

680
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:13,783
So, every ship that approaches
the Demilitarized Zone

681
00:32:13,819 --> 00:32:14,912
will be searched.

682
00:32:14,955 --> 00:32:17,187
Without the support
of the Central Command

683
00:32:17,225 --> 00:32:19,992
the Cardassian settlers
won't be so eager to fight.

684
00:32:20,031 --> 00:32:22,832
You forget the weapons
they already have.

685
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,897
They have weapons.

686
00:32:24,941 --> 00:32:26,740
You have weapons.

687
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,611
Everyone has weapons

688
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:32,144
but right now, no one
has a clear advantage.

689
00:32:32,189 --> 00:32:35,684
So, the price of peace
is at an all-time low.

690
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:38,600
This is the perfect time
to sit down

691
00:32:38,636 --> 00:32:40,799
and hammer out an agreement.

692
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,308
Don't you get it?

693
00:32:42,342 --> 00:32:46,146
Attacking the Cardassians now
will only escalate the conflict

694
00:32:46,183 --> 00:32:51,558
and make peace more expensive
in the long run.

695
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:55,262
Now, I ask you, is that logical?

696
00:32:57,674 --> 00:32:59,576
A concealed weapons depot

697
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:02,606
located within
a civilian population center?

698
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,176
According to Sakonna

699
00:33:04,219 --> 00:33:06,850
the Maquis are going
to attack the depot

700
00:33:06,892 --> 00:33:09,124
sometime
within the next 52 hours.

701
00:33:09,163 --> 00:33:10,826
But she didn't tell you
on which colony

702
00:33:10,866 --> 00:33:12,334
the depot is hidden.

703
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:13,337
She says she doesn't know.

704
00:33:13,371 --> 00:33:14,339
How convenient.

705
00:33:14,373 --> 00:33:15,432
I believe her.

706
00:33:15,475 --> 00:33:18,072
Why?
Because Vulcans don't lie?

707
00:33:18,114 --> 00:33:19,548
As a rule, they don't.

708
00:33:19,584 --> 00:33:22,249
They don't blow up
ships either, as a rule.

709
00:33:22,289 --> 00:33:24,817
But let's assume
she's telling the truth.

710
00:33:24,861 --> 00:33:27,662
I take it you haven't
shared this information

711
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,465
with the Central Command?

712
00:33:29,503 --> 00:33:31,302
No, I haven't.

713
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,105
Good, because they
would never trust you

714
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:34,373
to handle this matter alone.

715
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,607
But they would be able

716
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:38,085
to tell me where
the weapons depot is located.

717
00:33:38,121 --> 00:33:39,750
Leave that to me.

718
00:33:39,791 --> 00:33:44,027
I may no longer be a favorite
with Central Command

719
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:45,968
but I know people who are.

720
00:33:47,774 --> 00:33:50,337
In the meantime,
I'll go to Volon III

721
00:33:50,378 --> 00:33:52,177
and try to talk some sense
into the Maquis.

722
00:33:52,215 --> 00:33:53,274
And if you can't?

723
00:33:53,317 --> 00:33:55,253
Don't worry, Dukat.

724
00:33:55,288 --> 00:34:00,026
I said I would stop the Maquis,
and, one way or another, I will.

725
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:15,980
I've also
been recently informed

726
00:34:16,023 --> 00:34:18,425
that 35 people
had to be hospitalized

727
00:34:18,461 --> 00:34:20,226
on Umoth VIII after eating

728
00:34:20,264 --> 00:34:22,291
from public food replicators.

729
00:34:22,335 --> 00:34:23,998
Sabotage is suspected.

730
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:26,509
Then from now on,
guards should be posted

731
00:34:26,543 --> 00:34:28,740
at all public replicators
throughout the colonies.

732
00:34:28,815 --> 00:34:29,748
Thank you.

733
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,411
Now, about the new curfew...

734
00:34:33,658 --> 00:34:36,960
Commander Sisko,
what a pleasant surprise.

735
00:34:36,998 --> 00:34:39,093
If you'll just wait a moment,
I'll finish up this meeting

736
00:34:39,136 --> 00:34:40,536
and we can talk privately.

737
00:34:40,571 --> 00:34:42,564
That won't be necessary.

738
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:45,673
I want everyone to hear
what I have to say.

739
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:48,152
I don't know
how many of you here

740
00:34:48,187 --> 00:34:50,419
actually belong to the Maquis.

741
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:53,897
Those of you who don't
probably have friends who do.

742
00:34:53,932 --> 00:34:56,232
So, please make sure
you pass along

743
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,240
what I'm about to tell you.

744
00:34:58,274 --> 00:35:00,141
There is a treaty
currently in place

745
00:35:00,178 --> 00:35:01,578
with Cardassia
and the Federation.

746
00:35:01,614 --> 00:35:04,415
If you make yourself
an enemy of Cardassia

747
00:35:04,453 --> 00:35:07,152
you make yourself an enemy
of the Federation.

748
00:35:07,192 --> 00:35:08,319
That is outrageous.

749
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,557
Agreed.

750
00:35:10,598 --> 00:35:13,434
I know the Maquis
is planning to attack

751
00:35:13,471 --> 00:35:15,703
a Cardassian weapons depot.

752
00:35:15,742 --> 00:35:19,203
My advice to them and to you
is to call it off

753
00:35:19,249 --> 00:35:23,087
because I'll be waiting there,
and I will stop you.

754
00:35:30,939 --> 00:35:33,934
A very rousing speech, Ben.

755
00:35:33,979 --> 00:35:37,349
I suppose my best rebuttal
would be to kill you.

756
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,048
But you won't.

757
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,556
What is this?

758
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:46,728
Your uniform.

759
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:49,071
You always were an optimist.

760
00:35:49,109 --> 00:35:51,170
I have every reason to be.

761
00:35:51,213 --> 00:35:53,741
The way I see it,
now that we've stopped

762
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:56,051
the shipments
of Cardassian weapons

763
00:35:56,089 --> 00:35:58,822
there's no longer any need
for the Maquis.

764
00:35:58,862 --> 00:36:02,427
You and I can work together
to reach a peace agreement

765
00:36:02,468 --> 00:36:04,563
with the Cardassian colonies.

766
00:36:04,606 --> 00:36:06,633
It's too late for that.

767
00:36:06,678 --> 00:36:08,238
Is it?

768
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,050
We're in a war here,
and I intend to win it.

769
00:36:12,088 --> 00:36:14,685
I could use your help, Ben

770
00:36:14,727 --> 00:36:17,460
and I'm asking you as a friend.

771
00:36:17,498 --> 00:36:21,063
As a friend...

772
00:36:21,106 --> 00:36:23,303
I have to say no.

773
00:36:23,344 --> 00:36:26,475
If you attack the depot

774
00:36:26,516 --> 00:36:29,647
you'll have
to get through me first.

775
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:34,428
I hope not.
I truly hope not.

776
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:09,129
The Bryma colony...
according to my sources

777
00:37:09,169 --> 00:37:11,196
that's the location
of the weapons depot.

778
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:13,038
Then our objective is simple...

779
00:37:13,077 --> 00:37:15,513
prevent the Maquis ships
from reaching Bryma.

780
00:37:15,548 --> 00:37:17,450
We're going
to have to intercept them

781
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,352
before they're picked up
by the colony's sensors.

782
00:37:19,389 --> 00:37:20,357
Good point.

783
00:37:20,391 --> 00:37:21,985
If the Cardassian
settlers even suspect

784
00:37:22,028 --> 00:37:23,121
they might come under attack

785
00:37:23,163 --> 00:37:24,563
they'll send a message
to Cardassia

786
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:25,624
asking for reinforcements.

787
00:37:25,668 --> 00:37:26,636
I don't care how much

788
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,230
the Cardassians
care about the treaty

789
00:37:28,273 --> 00:37:30,801
if the Maquis launch an assault
against a civilian target

790
00:37:30,846 --> 00:37:32,645
the Central Command
will have to respond.

791
00:37:32,682 --> 00:37:35,245
We could wind up with
a full-scale war on our hands.

792
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:37,780
We have to stop the Maquis.

793
00:37:38,962 --> 00:37:41,559
Our runabouts will take up
a defensive position

794
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,093
just outside the Bryma colony's
sensor range.

795
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:45,938
The best way
to detect incoming ships

796
00:37:45,976 --> 00:37:47,946
would be to hide
a couple dozen sensor probes

797
00:37:48,046 --> 00:37:49,275
in the system's Oort cloud.

798
00:37:49,315 --> 00:37:50,909
That way,
we could spot the Maquis

799
00:37:50,952 --> 00:37:52,546
no matter what route they take.

800
00:37:52,588 --> 00:37:54,751
How many Maquis ships
are we expecting?

801
00:37:54,794 --> 00:37:56,525
According to Sakonna,
they only have two ships

802
00:37:56,563 --> 00:37:58,328
capable of mounting
the weapons she purchased.

803
00:37:58,367 --> 00:38:00,234
So, we'll have three ships,
and they'll have two.

804
00:38:00,271 --> 00:38:01,569
The odds are in our favor,
anyway.

805
00:38:01,606 --> 00:38:05,376
That's not going to give us
much of an advantage, Julian.

806
00:38:05,414 --> 00:38:07,008
The colonists are used
to being outnumbered.

807
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,349
They'll fight just
that much harder.

808
00:38:08,387 --> 00:38:10,016
How do you propose to stop them?

809
00:38:10,057 --> 00:38:12,050
What's that human expression?

810
00:38:12,094 --> 00:38:13,893
"Shoot to kill."

811
00:38:13,932 --> 00:38:16,198
We'll try to stop
them with words

812
00:38:16,236 --> 00:38:18,729
if possible;
with force, if necessary.

813
00:38:18,774 --> 00:38:21,610
So, if they fire at us,
we have orders to shoot back.

814
00:38:21,646 --> 00:38:23,046
That's correct.

815
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:25,451
We'll target their warp engines
and weapons arrays...

816
00:38:25,488 --> 00:38:26,456
try to disable them.

817
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,685
How noble.

818
00:38:27,725 --> 00:38:31,061
I hope the Maquis will be
as obliging to you.

819
00:38:36,643 --> 00:38:39,136
<i>Rio Grande</i> to
<i>Mekong</i> and <i>Orinoco.</i>

820
00:38:39,182 --> 00:38:40,514
How do you read me?

821
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:41,917
<i>Orinoco</i> here.
You're loud and clear.

822
00:38:41,954 --> 00:38:43,115
<i>Mekong</i> here.

823
00:38:43,156 --> 00:38:46,458
Our communications channel
is fully operational and secure.

824
00:38:46,496 --> 00:38:48,090
The remote sensor
probes I set up

825
00:38:48,133 --> 00:38:50,696
still haven't detected
any sign of the Maquis ships.

826
00:38:50,738 --> 00:38:52,469
Do you really think
they're coming?

827
00:38:52,508 --> 00:38:54,671
They know we're waiting
for them, after all.

828
00:38:54,712 --> 00:38:57,946
It's possible they changed
the time frame of their attack...

829
00:38:57,986 --> 00:38:59,512
postponed it a day or a week.

830
00:38:59,556 --> 00:39:00,751
They'll be here.

831
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:02,886
The longer they wait,
the greater the chance

832
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:05,493
the weapons depot will be
moved to another location.

833
00:39:16,323 --> 00:39:17,917
Commander, I'm picking up

834
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,691
two Federation ships
headed our way.

835
00:39:20,731 --> 00:39:22,257
Sisko to Hudson.

836
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:23,998
This isn't going to work, Cal.

837
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:27,671
Turn those ships around
before someone gets hurt.

838
00:39:27,712 --> 00:39:31,812
Please, Ben,
don't make me open fire on you.

839
00:39:34,292 --> 00:39:36,159
He's not going to listen.

840
00:39:36,196 --> 00:39:38,359
Initiating evasive maneuvers.

841
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,768
Signal Niles to follow my lead.

842
00:39:40,804 --> 00:39:42,433
Right.

843
00:39:51,493 --> 00:39:53,053
Commander, they're
making a run for it.

844
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:55,066
Lock on tractor beams.

845
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,076
Damn it!

846
00:40:00,144 --> 00:40:01,635
They've got Niles, too.

847
00:40:02,882 --> 00:40:04,350
Let us go, Ben.

848
00:40:04,385 --> 00:40:06,252
You know I can't do that.

849
00:40:06,289 --> 00:40:07,587
Then I suggest you duck.

850
00:40:09,228 --> 00:40:10,993
Fire on their beam emitter.

851
00:40:17,877 --> 00:40:19,540
What are you waiting for?

852
00:40:19,581 --> 00:40:21,107
We're losing tractor lock.

853
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,483
They're breaking away.

854
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,046
Commence firing.

855
00:40:28,899 --> 00:40:30,801
Niles' propulsion system
is down.

856
00:40:30,837 --> 00:40:32,135
He's drifting.

857
00:40:32,173 --> 00:40:33,870
We'll have to even the odds.

858
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:40,985
They've hit
our navigational array.

859
00:40:41,025 --> 00:40:43,018
I've lost attitude control.

860
00:40:43,062 --> 00:40:45,089
Attempting to compensate

861
00:40:45,133 --> 00:40:46,465
with manual thrusters.

862
00:40:46,502 --> 00:40:47,595
It's not working.

863
00:40:47,637 --> 00:40:49,003
Thrusters are still locked.

864
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:50,134
Hang on.

865
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,610
Chief, you go after
the <i>Orinoco.</i>

866
00:40:51,645 --> 00:40:52,670
I'll handle Hudson.

867
00:40:52,714 --> 00:40:53,739
Right. Major.

868
00:40:53,783 --> 00:40:55,115
- Yes, Chief?
- Lower your shields.

869
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:56,382
We'll beam you out of there.

870
00:40:56,422 --> 00:40:57,390
You got it.

871
00:40:57,424 --> 00:40:59,724
They're coming back around.

872
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,300
It's just you and me, Ben.

873
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:06,307
I can't let you start a war.

874
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:08,402
I'm not turning back.

875
00:41:08,446 --> 00:41:10,006
And you're not going forward.

876
00:41:17,864 --> 00:41:19,925
We're hit.

877
00:41:19,968 --> 00:41:21,699
Our photon torpedo tubes
are out.

878
00:41:21,738 --> 00:41:22,933
Switch to phasers.

879
00:41:22,974 --> 00:41:27,780
Come about,
heading 115 mark 326.

880
00:41:27,817 --> 00:41:29,149
Got it.

881
00:41:39,207 --> 00:41:42,874
We've taken a direct hit
on our primary fusion core.

882
00:41:42,914 --> 00:41:45,407
Initiating emergency
core shutdown.

883
00:41:45,453 --> 00:41:48,914
The port nacelle is flooded
with ionized deuterium.

884
00:41:48,959 --> 00:41:51,897
We've lost both warp
and impulse engines.

885
00:41:51,932 --> 00:41:54,402
We still have
maneuvering thrusters.

886
00:41:57,944 --> 00:41:59,207
They're coming back around.

887
00:41:59,247 --> 00:42:00,215
Use the phasers.

888
00:42:00,249 --> 00:42:01,809
I can't.

889
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,719
They've knocked out
the power couplings

890
00:42:03,756 --> 00:42:04,781
to our weapons array.

891
00:42:04,824 --> 00:42:06,885
What do we do?

892
00:42:06,929 --> 00:42:08,796
The only thing we can do.

893
00:42:08,832 --> 00:42:10,995
We get the hell out of here.

894
00:42:15,046 --> 00:42:16,014
He's turning away.

895
00:42:16,048 --> 00:42:17,448
Now's your chance... fire.

896
00:42:17,483 --> 00:42:18,951
It's over, Cal.

897
00:42:18,986 --> 00:42:21,081
For now, anyway.

898
00:42:21,124 --> 00:42:23,219
Next time, tell Starfleet
to send someone else.

899
00:42:23,262 --> 00:42:24,753
It doesn't feel right,
you and I

900
00:42:24,798 --> 00:42:25,891
shooting at each other.

901
00:42:25,933 --> 00:42:27,231
There won't be a next time.

902
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:28,236
Stand down!

903
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:30,241
I don't think so, Ben.

904
00:42:30,276 --> 00:42:31,608
He's getting away!

905
00:42:31,645 --> 00:42:34,446
You run now,
I won't be able to protect you.

906
00:42:34,484 --> 00:42:36,113
Starfleet will track you down.

907
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:37,588
You won't be safe anywhere...

908
00:42:37,624 --> 00:42:39,992
not even in the colonies.

909
00:42:40,028 --> 00:42:41,018
Don't be so sure.

910
00:42:41,064 --> 00:42:42,590
I have a lot of friends here.

911
00:42:42,634 --> 00:42:45,572
Besides, I've got to help
the Maquis finish this thing.

912
00:42:45,606 --> 00:42:47,074
You'll be an outlaw...

913
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:48,169
a hunted man.

914
00:42:48,212 --> 00:42:49,510
Maybe.

915
00:42:49,547 --> 00:42:51,278
You're throwing away
your entire life.

916
00:42:51,385 --> 00:42:54,152
And beginning a new one.

917
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,955
What are you waiting for?

918
00:42:55,993 --> 00:42:57,963
He's helpless.
Finish him.

919
00:42:57,997 --> 00:43:00,297
I'm going to miss you, Ben.

920
00:43:00,336 --> 00:43:02,636
You've been a good friend.

921
00:43:07,383 --> 00:43:09,376
So have you.

922
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:11,550
No!

923
00:43:16,501 --> 00:43:19,405
I thought you were strong,
Commander.

924
00:43:19,441 --> 00:43:21,104
You're not.

925
00:43:21,144 --> 00:43:22,578
You're a fool.

926
00:43:22,613 --> 00:43:25,278
A sentimental fool.

927
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:28,291
I said I'd stop the Maquis,
and I have

928
00:43:28,325 --> 00:43:31,456
but I will not kill a good man
for defending his home.

929
00:43:31,498 --> 00:43:34,265
You disappoint me.

930
00:43:34,304 --> 00:43:37,470
Don't expect me to lose
any sleep over it.

931
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:39,275
Mr. O'Brien,
when you get a chance

932
00:43:39,314 --> 00:43:41,477
I could use some help
with these engines.

933
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:42,508
Yes, sir.

934
00:43:50,903 --> 00:43:53,898
Commander, Gul Dukat
has left the station.

935
00:43:53,942 --> 00:43:55,809
I'm sure he's glad
to be going home.

936
00:43:55,846 --> 00:43:56,814
Chief O'Brien says

937
00:43:56,848 --> 00:43:58,647
that the <i>Orinoco</i>
and the <i>Rio Grande</i>

938
00:43:58,685 --> 00:44:00,484
will be up and running
in a few days.

939
00:44:00,523 --> 00:44:02,049
Thank you, Major.

940
00:44:02,092 --> 00:44:05,087
I just got a communiqué
from Starfleet

941
00:44:05,131 --> 00:44:07,226
congratulating me
on my good work

942
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:11,301
and thanking me for preserving
the peace with the Cardassians.

943
00:44:11,344 --> 00:44:13,211
You deserve it.

944
00:44:13,248 --> 00:44:15,309
You prevented a war.

945
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:17,947
Did I?

946
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:21,258
Or did I just
delay the inevitable?
