1
00:00:02,196 --> 00:00:04,325
Can I interest you
in some more Yigrish cream pie?

2
00:00:04,367 --> 00:00:06,496
No, thank you, Doctor.
I'm quite full.

3
00:00:06,538 --> 00:00:08,667
But you've hardly
touched your food.

4
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:11,009
Well, the truth is I'm trying
to lose a little weight.

5
00:00:11,047 --> 00:00:12,676
Hemming women's dresses

6
00:00:12,717 --> 00:00:14,880
may provide me
with a modest income

7
00:00:14,921 --> 00:00:17,187
but it offers very little
in the way of exercise.

8
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:18,285
Well, if you like

9
00:00:18,328 --> 00:00:19,957
I can help you set up
an exercise program

10
00:00:19,998 --> 00:00:21,023
in one of the holosuites.

11
00:00:21,067 --> 00:00:23,698
I might just take you up on that

12
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:26,506
and, uh, speaking
of holosuites...

13
00:00:26,545 --> 00:00:28,013
happy birthday.

14
00:00:28,048 --> 00:00:30,109
I know it's a few days off

15
00:00:30,152 --> 00:00:33,318
but I wanted to give you
your present early.

16
00:00:33,358 --> 00:00:35,921
It's a Cardassian
holosuite program.

17
00:00:35,963 --> 00:00:39,424
An adaptation of one
of Shoggoth's enigma tales.

18
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,938
Is it? I see.

19
00:00:40,973 --> 00:00:43,239
Well, you sound disappointed.

20
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:46,340
I thought you enjoyed
mystery novels.

21
00:00:46,384 --> 00:00:47,682
I do.

22
00:00:47,721 --> 00:00:49,350
Human mystery novels.

23
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,260
The trouble
with Cardassian enigma tales

24
00:00:52,296 --> 00:00:54,859
is that they all end
the same way...

25
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:57,873
all the suspects
are always guilty.

26
00:00:57,907 --> 00:01:00,538
Yes, but the challenge
is determining

27
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,709
exactly who is guilty of what.

28
00:01:06,658 --> 00:01:09,425
Is Lieutenant Dax
throwing one of her

29
00:01:09,463 --> 00:01:12,230
surprise parties
for you this year?

30
00:01:12,302 --> 00:01:13,862
Oh. So I'm told.

31
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:16,571
Well, you don't sound
enthusiastic about that either.

32
00:01:16,612 --> 00:01:18,548
Well, it's not
that I don't appreciate

33
00:01:18,582 --> 00:01:20,848
all the trouble she goes to
and everything.

34
00:01:20,887 --> 00:01:24,223
It's just that... this year
is a little different.

35
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,455
How so?

36
00:01:25,495 --> 00:01:27,965
This will be my 30th birthday.

37
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:29,868
And?

38
00:01:29,905 --> 00:01:31,271
Well...

39
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:33,037
in many human cultures

40
00:01:33,077 --> 00:01:36,881
the 30th birthday is considered
a sort of landmark.

41
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:38,980
It marks the end of youth

42
00:01:39,023 --> 00:01:42,793
and the beginning of the slow
march into middle age.

43
00:01:42,831 --> 00:01:46,065
And that's considered bad?

44
00:01:46,103 --> 00:01:48,631
No. It's just
that when you hit 30

45
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:52,776
it becomes harder and harder
to ignore the passage of time.

46
00:01:52,817 --> 00:01:54,308
I wasn't aware

47
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,758
that humans saw growing old
as a negative experience.

48
00:01:58,796 --> 00:02:00,425
On Cardassia

49
00:02:00,465 --> 00:02:04,200
advanced age is seen
as a sign of power, dignity.

50
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,401
Well, I am aware that aging

51
00:02:05,442 --> 00:02:07,139
is part of the natural
process of life.

52
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:09,912
It's just that I don't want to
be reminded of it, that's all.

53
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:11,614
And look, Garak,
in two days, I turn 30.

54
00:02:11,655 --> 00:02:14,991
If I choose to be grumpy
about it, that's my prerogative.

55
00:02:15,028 --> 00:02:17,625
By all means, Doctor,
be as grumpy as you like.

56
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:19,569
Well, thank you for the support.

57
00:02:19,603 --> 00:02:20,901
Excuse me, Doctor.

58
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,534
What?!

59
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,603
Oh, Quark, I'm sorry.

60
00:02:24,648 --> 00:02:26,481
How can I help you?

61
00:02:26,517 --> 00:02:30,457
Um... my friend Altovar here

62
00:02:30,492 --> 00:02:34,023
is looking to purchase
a small quantity of...

63
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:35,660
bio-mimetic gel.

64
00:02:35,703 --> 00:02:37,935
And I was wondering
if, uh, you might be able

65
00:02:37,974 --> 00:02:39,534
to tell him where he can find

66
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:43,745
let's say, uh... a few
hundred milliliters.

67
00:02:43,786 --> 00:02:46,154
Bio-mimetic gel
is a restricted substance.

68
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,128
Its sale is strictly prohibited
by Federation law.

69
00:02:49,163 --> 00:02:50,894
I thought so.

70
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:52,903
You see?
I told you.

71
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:59,606
I'm willing to pay
whatever's necessary.

72
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,054
Name your price.

73
00:03:03,091 --> 00:03:05,061
Why do you need it?

74
00:03:05,095 --> 00:03:07,794
That's my business.

75
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:11,535
Oh. Well, I am sorry,
but bio-mimetic gel

76
00:03:11,574 --> 00:03:14,239
can be hazardous
if handled incorrectly.

77
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:17,342
It's not for sale...
at any price.

78
00:03:17,386 --> 00:03:19,549
Well... we tried.

79
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,683
Thank you, Doctor.

80
00:03:20,726 --> 00:03:22,024
Quark...

81
00:03:22,062 --> 00:03:25,000
you might want
to warn your friend

82
00:03:25,035 --> 00:03:27,666
that even attempting
to obtain bio-mimetic gel

83
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:29,539
is a felony
under Federation law.

84
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:30,601
I know.

85
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:32,808
I told him that, but he
insisted I ask you anyway.

86
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,947
Letheans can be
incredibly stubborn.

87
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,791
I... hope

88
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:40,127
you'll forgive the interruption.

89
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:41,258
Of course.

90
00:03:45,776 --> 00:03:47,405
You know...

91
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:51,010
we just introduced
a new lunch menu at the bar...

92
00:03:51,053 --> 00:03:52,351
Good-bye, Quark.

93
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:54,586
Don't take it personally.

94
00:03:54,626 --> 00:03:56,117
He's turning 30.

95
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,241
Lights.

96
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:05,747
What do you think
you're doing here?

97
00:06:28,742 --> 00:06:30,473
Bashir to Security.

98
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,817
Oh...

99
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:42,827
Bashir to Ops.

100
00:06:46,511 --> 00:06:48,481
This is Doctor Bashir.

101
00:06:48,515 --> 00:06:50,382
Can anyone read me?

102
00:06:53,225 --> 00:06:56,288
Computer,
locate Commander Sisko.

103
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,163
Computer, respond.

104
00:07:04,147 --> 00:07:06,083
Computer...

105
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,794
Hello?

106
00:07:20,412 --> 00:07:22,006
Is somebody there?

107
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:30,292
Hello?

108
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,878
Is there anybody there?

109
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:47,458
Where is everybody?

110
00:08:24,173 --> 00:08:25,402
Who's there?

111
00:08:36,865 --> 00:08:38,528
Quark?

112
00:08:45,048 --> 00:08:46,642
It's all right.

113
00:08:46,684 --> 00:08:48,244
It's me, Bashir.

114
00:08:48,288 --> 00:08:49,688
Okay. What is it?

115
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,886
What's going on?
Tell me.

116
00:08:51,928 --> 00:08:54,559
He's going to kill us.

117
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,968
He's going to kill us all.

118
00:08:57,005 --> 00:08:59,032
Who?
Who are you so afraid of?

119
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:03,618
Well, where's Sisko?

120
00:09:03,652 --> 00:09:05,485
What happened
to the rest of the crew?

121
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:08,991
Why don't you come with me?

122
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:11,626
We'll go and try to find them.

123
00:09:11,668 --> 00:09:13,365
No...

124
00:09:13,405 --> 00:09:15,170
don't you see?

125
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:18,704
If we move, he'll find us.

126
00:09:20,886 --> 00:09:23,551
If we stay here

127
00:09:23,592 --> 00:09:25,653
we might be safe.

128
00:09:25,696 --> 00:09:27,689
Safe?

129
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,861
From whom?

130
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:33,035
Quark, you have got to tell me.

131
00:09:37,219 --> 00:09:38,551
He's here.

132
00:09:38,588 --> 00:09:41,321
We've got to find a way
to put these lights back on.

133
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:44,162
It's too late.
He's found us.

134
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,691
We've got to get out.

135
00:09:46,738 --> 00:09:47,728
Wait!

136
00:09:48,742 --> 00:09:49,903
Who's there?

137
00:09:49,944 --> 00:09:50,912
Show yourself!

138
00:09:59,297 --> 00:10:00,788
Quark?

139
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:03,801
Quark.

140
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:22,905
Tarkalean tea.

141
00:10:26,684 --> 00:10:28,449
Constable?

142
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,847
Garak!

143
00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:48,622
Doctor!
What are you doing here?

144
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:50,597
I was about to ask you
the same question.

145
00:10:50,632 --> 00:10:51,861
I was looking for Constable Odo.

146
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,962
Everyone on this station
seems to have disappeared.

147
00:10:54,005 --> 00:10:54,973
Not everyone.

148
00:10:55,007 --> 00:10:56,373
I just saw Quark
cowering behind his bar.

149
00:10:56,411 --> 00:10:58,244
He believes that someone
is terrorizing the station

150
00:10:58,281 --> 00:10:59,613
and I'm not sure
I disagree with him.

151
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,709
What do you mean?

152
00:11:00,752 --> 00:11:02,015
Tell me, what's going on?

153
00:11:02,055 --> 00:11:04,116
There is some thing in Quark's
tearing up the place.

154
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:06,322
I didn't get a really good look
at it, but believe me

155
00:11:06,364 --> 00:11:07,332
it was not friendly.

156
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:08,334
Computer...

157
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:09,336
It's no use.

158
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,736
As far as I can tell

159
00:11:10,772 --> 00:11:13,140
the station has suffered
a massive systems failure.

160
00:11:13,178 --> 00:11:15,410
Aside from life support
and simple functions

161
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:17,977
like turbolifts and doors,
nothing seems to work.

162
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,651
It's been like that for hours.

163
00:11:20,692 --> 00:11:23,026
I was up late, programming
some replicator patterns

164
00:11:23,063 --> 00:11:25,499
for a suit I'm designing,
when everything went dead.

165
00:11:25,535 --> 00:11:27,869
I can't believe
that you, Quark and I

166
00:11:27,906 --> 00:11:30,537
are the only people
left on this station.

167
00:11:30,579 --> 00:11:32,981
Sisko and the others
must be around somewhere.

168
00:11:33,016 --> 00:11:34,314
Maybe.

169
00:11:34,353 --> 00:11:37,655
Or maybe they've fallen victim
to some kind of rampant virus.

170
00:11:37,693 --> 00:11:39,595
Or space anomaly,
or Dominion plot.

171
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,000
All the more reason
to try and locate them.

172
00:11:45,442 --> 00:11:47,309
Wait...

173
00:11:47,346 --> 00:11:49,043
do you hear that?

174
00:11:51,254 --> 00:11:52,381
Hear what?

175
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:55,519
That sound...

176
00:11:55,562 --> 00:11:57,589
it's like voices...

177
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,658
whispering.

178
00:11:58,701 --> 00:12:00,728
I don't hear anything.

179
00:12:00,772 --> 00:12:04,803
But then, Cardassian hearing
is not quite as acute as humans.

180
00:12:04,847 --> 00:12:06,510
Doctor, are you
feeling all right?

181
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:07,849
You look...

182
00:12:07,886 --> 00:12:09,412
different somehow.

183
00:12:09,456 --> 00:12:10,424
What is it?

184
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,225
Your hair...
it seems to be turning gray.

185
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:14,357
So I've noticed.

186
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,390
I guess you had reason

187
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,064
to feel worried
about turning 30, after all.

188
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:18,299
Either that

189
00:12:18,341 --> 00:12:20,573
or your job is even more
stressful than I'd thought.

190
00:12:20,612 --> 00:12:22,411
Look, Garak, we haven't
got time for this.

191
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:24,316
We've got to find out
what's going on here.

192
00:12:24,353 --> 00:12:25,321
I agree.

193
00:12:25,355 --> 00:12:26,687
Perhaps we should split up.

194
00:12:26,724 --> 00:12:28,215
I can search the Docking Ring

195
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:29,924
while you look around
the Habitat Ring

196
00:12:29,997 --> 00:12:31,022
and the Central Core.

197
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:32,933
I'll meet you back
on the Promenade in an hour.

198
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:33,938
Be careful.

199
00:12:33,972 --> 00:12:34,940
You, too.

200
00:12:34,974 --> 00:12:37,467
And, Doctor, try to relax.

201
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,814
Level H-1, section A.

202
00:14:06,528 --> 00:14:08,623
Look, what are we doing
standing around here?

203
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,467
What do you want to do,
rush out and get us all killed?

204
00:14:11,505 --> 00:14:13,975
It's better than doing nothing.
Let's go.

205
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:16,479
Or follow you right into a trap.

206
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:17,642
Is that what you want?

207
00:14:17,684 --> 00:14:18,845
You're all crazy.

208
00:14:18,886 --> 00:14:21,483
None of this is helping us
deal with the Lethean.

209
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:23,688
Well, I don't see you
coming up with anything.

210
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:27,533
If you'd all stop talking and
give me some time to think

211
00:14:27,604 --> 00:14:28,697
maybe I would.

212
00:14:28,739 --> 00:14:30,732
I say we do nothing
until we get reinforcements...

213
00:14:30,776 --> 00:14:32,336
Julian, there you are.
Where have you been?

214
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,348
Looking for you.

215
00:14:33,382 --> 00:14:35,545
Well, I'm glad you're here.

216
00:14:35,586 --> 00:14:37,556
...the communications
system back on line.

217
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,558
It'll take hours.

218
00:14:38,592 --> 00:14:40,562
Too many systems
have been sabotaged.

219
00:14:40,596 --> 00:14:41,859
All my work crews are missing.

220
00:14:41,898 --> 00:14:43,059
And I cannot make new parts

221
00:14:43,101 --> 00:14:44,730
until we get
the replicators fixed.

222
00:14:44,771 --> 00:14:48,266
The first thing we need to do
is neutralize the Lethean.

223
00:14:48,311 --> 00:14:50,076
The Lethean?
You mean Altovar?

224
00:14:50,115 --> 00:14:51,083
You know him?

225
00:14:51,117 --> 00:14:52,085
We've met.

226
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:53,246
He attacked me in the Infirmary.

227
00:14:53,288 --> 00:14:54,586
Oh, well, now he's
trying to kill us all

228
00:14:54,624 --> 00:14:55,592
by destroying the station.

229
00:14:55,626 --> 00:14:56,719
What are we waiting for?

230
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:58,595
Let's get some phasers
and hunt him down.

231
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:01,695
If you ask me, none of us
are safe until he is dead.

232
00:15:01,738 --> 00:15:03,104
If we go looking for the Lethean

233
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:04,473
we're the ones
who'll end up dead.

234
00:15:04,511 --> 00:15:06,310
I'll tell you what...
if we find the Lethean

235
00:15:06,347 --> 00:15:07,747
maybe we can find you
a backbone!

236
00:15:07,784 --> 00:15:10,118
Maybe he doesn't want us
to find the Lethean.

237
00:15:10,155 --> 00:15:11,715
Maybe he's in league with him.

238
00:15:11,758 --> 00:15:13,557
Computer.

239
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:17,397
Scan the occupants of this room
for any anomalies.

240
00:15:17,437 --> 00:15:19,270
Doctor, what are you doing?

241
00:15:19,306 --> 00:15:22,905
You're all acting very strangely
and I intend to find out why.

242
00:15:22,947 --> 00:15:23,937
Computer!

243
00:15:23,982 --> 00:15:25,007
Don't bother, Doctor.

244
00:15:25,051 --> 00:15:26,884
For some reason,
the computer isn't working.

245
00:15:26,922 --> 00:15:29,392
Don't go blaming me for that,
Constable.

246
00:15:29,426 --> 00:15:32,057
None of this would be happening
if Security had done its job.

247
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,226
That's enough.

248
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,795
Where is Sisko?

249
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,331
Where are O'Brien's work crews?

250
00:15:37,376 --> 00:15:39,710
I've been wandering
around this station for hours

251
00:15:39,748 --> 00:15:42,379
and the only two people
I've seen are Quark and Garak.

252
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:44,855
Where is everybody else?

253
00:15:44,891 --> 00:15:46,952
There's something
very wrong here.

254
00:15:46,995 --> 00:15:48,828
I'd say there is.

255
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:50,699
Have you looked
in a mirror lately?

256
00:15:51,738 --> 00:15:52,637
Hold on.

257
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,074
Does anybody else hear that?

258
00:15:55,111 --> 00:15:56,443
What?

259
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:57,915
I don't hear anything.

260
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,647
Garak didn't either.

261
00:15:59,687 --> 00:16:01,919
Julian, what are
you talking about?

262
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:05,021
I know, I know it sounds odd,
but I keep hearing voices.

263
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,159
And he says we're
acting peculiar?

264
00:16:07,202 --> 00:16:09,799
What are these so-called
voices saying?

265
00:16:09,841 --> 00:16:11,606
That's just the problem.

266
00:16:11,645 --> 00:16:13,706
I can't make out the words.

267
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:16,949
Oh, I think you're the one
who needs help, Doctor, not us.

268
00:16:16,988 --> 00:16:18,251
Maybe you should lie down.

269
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,261
I'm fine.

270
00:16:20,295 --> 00:16:22,731
Except... you're hearing voices.

271
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:26,468
And you've aged about 30 years
in the last few hours.

272
00:16:26,508 --> 00:16:28,944
There must be
some logical explanation.

273
00:16:28,979 --> 00:16:31,507
Maybe there's a virus
or a subspace anomaly

274
00:16:31,551 --> 00:16:34,352
a neural inversion field,
an anaphasic parasite.

275
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:36,018
You keep thinking, Julian.

276
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,189
And while you try
to figure it out

277
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:39,665
I'll find the Lethean
and stop him

278
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:41,634
from sabotaging
any of the other systems.

279
00:16:41,671 --> 00:16:43,641
And what good will that do?

280
00:16:43,675 --> 00:16:45,041
You have no idea where he is.

281
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:47,207
We don't know what we're up
against, how strong he is

282
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:49,048
if he can be hurt
by phaser fire.

283
00:16:49,086 --> 00:16:50,111
Don't worry, Chief.

284
00:16:50,154 --> 00:16:52,147
I wasn't asking
for any of your help.

285
00:16:52,192 --> 00:16:53,991
If he's here, I'll find him

286
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:55,965
even if I have to do it
all by myself.

287
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,968
Calm down, Dax.

288
00:16:57,002 --> 00:16:58,436
You're not going anywhere.

289
00:16:58,471 --> 00:16:59,439
No one is.

290
00:16:59,473 --> 00:17:00,907
There are
too many strange things

291
00:17:00,943 --> 00:17:02,070
going on on this station...

292
00:17:02,112 --> 00:17:04,207
my aging, O'Brien's
missing crew members

293
00:17:04,249 --> 00:17:06,515
sabotage to the station,
your abnormal behavior.

294
00:17:06,555 --> 00:17:08,525
You think it's
all connected somehow?

295
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,756
I think we should find out.

296
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:15,294
Is there any way of getting
the internal sensors on line?

297
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:18,903
There's a computer processing
junction near here.

298
00:17:18,946 --> 00:17:22,282
I might be able to repair
the internal sensors from there.

299
00:17:24,389 --> 00:17:25,880
But I'm not going alone.

300
00:17:25,926 --> 00:17:27,623
Oh, what a surprise.

301
00:17:27,663 --> 00:17:29,690
Don't worry, I'm not letting you
out of my sight.

302
00:17:29,734 --> 00:17:31,363
We'll all go together.

303
00:17:31,403 --> 00:17:32,530
Let's move.

304
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:48,359
It's even worse than I thought.

305
00:17:48,404 --> 00:17:49,429
The entire sensor array

306
00:17:49,473 --> 00:17:51,705
is burnt out and there's
extensive damage

307
00:17:51,745 --> 00:17:53,840
to the computer's
central processor.

308
00:17:53,882 --> 00:17:55,977
The only system
that looks salvageable

309
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,081
is the subspace
communications relay.

310
00:17:58,124 --> 00:18:00,390
Well, that would at least
let us contact Bajor.

311
00:18:00,428 --> 00:18:02,227
See what you can do, Chief.

312
00:18:02,265 --> 00:18:04,360
Constable, would you
stop doing that?

313
00:18:04,403 --> 00:18:05,371
Doing what?

314
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:06,373
Looking around like that.

315
00:18:06,407 --> 00:18:07,375
It's getting on my nerves.

316
00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:10,006
There's no harm
in keeping both eyes open.

317
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:12,211
I don't remember
asking your opinion.

318
00:18:12,252 --> 00:18:14,119
If the Lethean's around,
I want to know it.

319
00:18:14,156 --> 00:18:16,626
Last time I saw him,
he was in the Central Core.

320
00:18:16,661 --> 00:18:17,993
The Central Core?
What level were you on?

321
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,863
Level 5,
but I doubt he's still there.

322
00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:20,869
I think I lost him.

323
00:18:20,903 --> 00:18:22,497
You think?

324
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:23,939
Just keep working, Chief.

325
00:18:23,975 --> 00:18:24,943
For all we know

326
00:18:24,977 --> 00:18:26,674
he could be
right outside the door.

327
00:18:26,715 --> 00:18:29,448
And if he is,
then you'll have led him here.

328
00:18:29,486 --> 00:18:31,012
Hold on, Lieutenant.

329
00:18:31,056 --> 00:18:33,322
I think I've got the
communications relay working.

330
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,957
Open hailing frequencies.
Try to contact Bajor.

331
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:38,664
Hold on.
Ah, it's not working.

332
00:18:38,705 --> 00:18:40,766
But I'm receiving a signal.

333
00:18:40,843 --> 00:18:42,311
Audio only.

334
00:18:42,345 --> 00:18:43,939
Well, let's hear it.

335
00:18:43,982 --> 00:18:45,348
I'm patching it through.

336
00:18:45,384 --> 00:18:47,684
...four cc's of cordrazine,
but there was no response.

337
00:18:47,723 --> 00:18:49,955
That sounds like you,
Lieutenant.

338
00:18:49,994 --> 00:18:52,989
There has to be something
we can do.

339
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:54,798
Well, that's Sisko's voice.

340
00:18:54,837 --> 00:18:55,805
We've tried everything

341
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:57,171
we can think of,
but we haven't been able

342
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,676
to counteract
the telepathic damage.

343
00:18:58,712 --> 00:19:00,511
His motor functions
are minimal...

344
00:19:00,548 --> 00:19:01,743
Where's this signal coming from?

345
00:19:01,818 --> 00:19:02,751
I don't know.

346
00:19:02,853 --> 00:19:05,221
Somewhere outside the station.

347
00:19:05,258 --> 00:19:06,453
Give me the bottom line.

348
00:19:06,493 --> 00:19:08,656
The bottom line is
that Julian's in some kind

349
00:19:08,698 --> 00:19:10,098
of telepathically-induced coma.

350
00:19:10,134 --> 00:19:11,694
And unless we can
get him out of it

351
00:19:11,738 --> 00:19:13,469
he'll be dead
in less than three hours.

352
00:19:13,507 --> 00:19:14,770
I'll be in my office.

353
00:19:14,811 --> 00:19:16,644
Keep me informed.

354
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:18,674
What the hell's going on here?

355
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,931
Delta waves.

356
00:19:30,174 --> 00:19:32,907
When I scan myself
for brain activity

357
00:19:32,947 --> 00:19:35,976
all I get are
low-frequency delta waves.

358
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:37,682
And what's that
supposed to mean?

359
00:19:37,723 --> 00:19:40,820
It means that the voices
were telling the truth.

360
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,698
I'm... in a coma.

361
00:19:56,493 --> 00:19:58,292
How can you stand there

362
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,357
and say that you're in a coma?

363
00:20:00,401 --> 00:20:01,391
That's crazy.

364
00:20:01,436 --> 00:20:03,235
Not necessarily, Major.

365
00:20:03,274 --> 00:20:06,041
I suppose the next thing
you're going to tell us

366
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,810
is that we're unconscious.

367
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,252
Not according to these readings.

368
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:11,551
Glad to hear it.

369
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:16,054
Actually, I'm not picking up
any life signs from you at all.

370
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:18,194
Let me see that.

371
00:20:21,677 --> 00:20:23,806
You want to know
what this means?

372
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,182
This tricorder is broken.

373
00:20:26,219 --> 00:20:27,380
That's what it means.

374
00:20:27,422 --> 00:20:28,856
I don't think so.

375
00:20:28,892 --> 00:20:29,917
What are you saying, Doctor?

376
00:20:30,027 --> 00:20:30,926
That we don't exist?

377
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:33,090
Oh, I've had enough of this.

378
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:36,299
I am not some figment
of your imagination.

379
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,638
But don't you see?

380
00:20:37,675 --> 00:20:40,203
That is why you are all
behaving so strangely.

381
00:20:40,247 --> 00:20:41,944
I'm not behaving strangely.

382
00:20:42,018 --> 00:20:43,111
Am I?

383
00:20:43,153 --> 00:20:45,056
You all are.

384
00:20:45,189 --> 00:20:47,455
Dax, you're not usually
the sort of person

385
00:20:47,494 --> 00:20:50,898
to solve her problems by
running around with a phaser.

386
00:20:50,934 --> 00:20:54,567
And, Chief, you aren't
usually so pessimistic.

387
00:20:54,608 --> 00:20:55,667
Look, we are wasting time.

388
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,270
The Lethean could
be here any minute.

389
00:20:57,313 --> 00:21:00,946
So if you're in a coma,
and we're not real

390
00:21:00,988 --> 00:21:02,354
then what are we doing here?

391
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:05,157
Or maybe we're just here
to give him someone to talk to.

392
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:11,268
A paranoid, a coward,
a hothead and me?

393
00:21:11,308 --> 00:21:13,437
Oh, you'd think he'd pick
some better company.

394
00:21:13,512 --> 00:21:16,040
I haven't picked any of you.

395
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:17,815
I'm in a coma.

396
00:21:17,855 --> 00:21:20,793
I'm the only one
who's really here.

397
00:21:20,827 --> 00:21:22,854
Which means
when I'm talking to you

398
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:25,300
I'm really
only talking to myself.

399
00:21:25,336 --> 00:21:27,306
I wish you wouldn't say that.

400
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,105
It's the only
possible explanation.

401
00:21:29,144 --> 00:21:32,082
So...

402
00:21:32,116 --> 00:21:35,020
you're saying I'm you?

403
00:21:35,056 --> 00:21:36,319
In a manner of speaking.

404
00:21:36,358 --> 00:21:38,385
And I suppose he's you, too.

405
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:39,829
You all are.

406
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:44,203
You all embody different aspects
of my personality...

407
00:21:44,241 --> 00:21:47,509
different voices inside my head.

408
00:21:47,614 --> 00:21:49,880
I don't believe
we're having this discussion.

409
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,482
If I were to guess, Chief

410
00:21:52,523 --> 00:21:55,495
I would say that you
represent my doubt...

411
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:56,519
and my disbelief.

412
00:21:56,632 --> 00:21:58,100
No, I don't!

413
00:21:58,135 --> 00:22:00,196
I knew you were going
to say that.

414
00:22:00,239 --> 00:22:04,111
Major... you're
the perfect choice

415
00:22:04,147 --> 00:22:06,117
for my aggression.

416
00:22:06,151 --> 00:22:07,642
And, Odo...

417
00:22:07,687 --> 00:22:12,094
you represent my sense
of suspicion and fear.

418
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,759
Dax...

419
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:21,514
to me, you've always
represented my confidence...

420
00:22:21,581 --> 00:22:23,141
and sense of adventure.

421
00:22:23,185 --> 00:22:24,153
Ha!

422
00:22:24,187 --> 00:22:25,212
Thank you, Julian.

423
00:22:25,256 --> 00:22:26,919
You're forgetting something,
Doctor.

424
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:28,052
What about the Lethean?

425
00:22:28,095 --> 00:22:30,361
What is he supposed
to represent?

426
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:34,533
I suppose he represents
the telepathic damage

427
00:22:34,574 --> 00:22:37,239
that the real Lethean
did to my mind.

428
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,150
So why is this Lethean
running around

429
00:22:40,186 --> 00:22:42,418
sabotaging the station?

430
00:22:42,457 --> 00:22:46,659
It's not the station
he's sabotaging.

431
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,861
It's my mind!

432
00:22:50,272 --> 00:22:53,767
The station represents my mind.

433
00:22:53,812 --> 00:22:57,582
Just as you represent different
aspects of my personality.

434
00:22:57,687 --> 00:22:59,019
Think about it!

435
00:22:59,057 --> 00:23:01,620
When the Chief fixed
the communications relay

436
00:23:01,661 --> 00:23:04,929
we could hear what was happening
in the real world.

437
00:23:04,969 --> 00:23:06,403
It's like he restored
your hearing.

438
00:23:06,438 --> 00:23:07,736
Exactly.

439
00:23:07,774 --> 00:23:10,371
So if we could repair
the station...

440
00:23:10,413 --> 00:23:12,542
You'd wake up.

441
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:15,714
But if you wake up,
what happens to us?

442
00:23:15,756 --> 00:23:18,785
Julian!
Julian!

443
00:23:18,829 --> 00:23:20,662
Jadzia!

444
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:21,894
Help me, Julian!

445
00:23:22,971 --> 00:23:24,439
Jadzia.

446
00:23:25,409 --> 00:23:26,399
Jadzia!

447
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:35,283
How did I get here?

448
00:23:35,329 --> 00:23:37,094
Oh, don't ask me.

449
00:23:37,133 --> 00:23:39,866
After all, we're
inside your mind.

450
00:23:39,904 --> 00:23:44,038
It's a pity
about Lieutenant Dax.

451
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,608
How do you know about her?

452
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:48,449
I'm a part of you, remember?

453
00:23:48,489 --> 00:23:49,821
I know what you know.

454
00:23:49,858 --> 00:23:50,917
Well...

455
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:52,259
maybe a little more.

456
00:23:52,296 --> 00:23:53,925
Still the man of mystery?

457
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:56,495
Oh, you wouldn't have me
any other way.

458
00:23:57,941 --> 00:24:00,538
Oh, I'm getting
a little too old for this game.

459
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:02,481
Yes, apparently so.

460
00:24:02,517 --> 00:24:07,687
You... or should I say "we"?...
are running out of time.

461
00:24:07,727 --> 00:24:10,324
Your service, Doctor.

462
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:11,800
I can't stay here.

463
00:24:11,835 --> 00:24:13,930
I have to get the main computer
back on line.

464
00:24:13,973 --> 00:24:15,840
Then you'd better get to Ops.

465
00:24:15,876 --> 00:24:19,714
If there are repairs to be done,
that's the place to do them.

466
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:21,277
You're right.

467
00:24:21,321 --> 00:24:23,154
Try to find Kira,
Odo and O'Brien.

468
00:24:23,191 --> 00:24:24,785
Tell them to meet me in Ops.

469
00:24:24,827 --> 00:24:26,125
I'd be delighted.

470
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:29,227
I wonder if any of them
plays tennis?

471
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,972
Doctor, help us.

472
00:24:51,047 --> 00:24:53,040
I'll handle this, Doctor.

473
00:24:55,689 --> 00:24:58,286
She's suffering cranial trauma.

474
00:24:58,328 --> 00:25:00,764
Treat the fracture with
an osteogenic stimulator

475
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,826
and then follow it up with...

476
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,965
Two cc's of inpedrezine.

477
00:25:06,077 --> 00:25:08,104
How did you know that?

478
00:25:10,085 --> 00:25:11,280
Just doing my job.

479
00:25:11,321 --> 00:25:12,289
No, you're not.

480
00:25:12,323 --> 00:25:13,382
You're doing my job.

481
00:25:13,425 --> 00:25:15,988
And what's more, you're doing it
as well as I could.

482
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:19,630
Give him a coagulation activator
to stop the bleeding.

483
00:25:19,671 --> 00:25:22,939
You represent
my professionalism...

484
00:25:22,977 --> 00:25:24,571
and my skill.

485
00:25:24,614 --> 00:25:26,516
I'm flattered.

486
00:25:27,553 --> 00:25:29,386
Come on.

487
00:25:29,424 --> 00:25:31,417
You're going to come with me

488
00:25:31,461 --> 00:25:32,861
to Ops.

489
00:25:32,897 --> 00:25:34,331
But I'm needed here.

490
00:25:36,003 --> 00:25:39,568
I can't repair the station
without your help.

491
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,443
I suppose you're right.

492
00:25:41,481 --> 00:25:43,178
Look after things here.

493
00:25:43,218 --> 00:25:44,186
I won't be long.

494
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,985
Yes, sir.

495
00:25:46,424 --> 00:25:48,257
No!

496
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,699
You're not going anywhere,
Doctor.

497
00:26:16,684 --> 00:26:20,020
You're staying right here,
trapped on this station

498
00:26:20,057 --> 00:26:22,927
watching while I destroy you
piece by piece.

499
00:26:22,963 --> 00:26:26,026
And when all the best parts
of you are gone

500
00:26:26,069 --> 00:26:29,200
when there's nothing left
but the withered shell

501
00:26:29,243 --> 00:26:33,981
then, and only then, will I
put you out of your misery.

502
00:26:37,726 --> 00:26:39,923
You can't escape, Doctor!

503
00:26:39,964 --> 00:26:43,802
You can run if you want to,
but you can't outrun death.

504
00:26:58,802 --> 00:27:00,567
Major.

505
00:27:00,606 --> 00:27:01,835
Doctor...

506
00:27:12,663 --> 00:27:14,963
Odo...

507
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:16,435
what happened?

508
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:18,771
The Lethean.

509
00:27:18,842 --> 00:27:20,402
He came out of nowhere.

510
00:27:20,445 --> 00:27:24,579
He's trying to rob me
of my confidence.

511
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,148
My intelligence.

512
00:27:27,192 --> 00:27:29,823
My strength.

513
00:27:32,303 --> 00:27:33,617
I have to get to Ops.

514
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,413
Use the conduits.

515
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,515
They're your best chance.

516
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:41,089
I have to get there
while I still can.

517
00:28:04,345 --> 00:28:05,711
Chief.

518
00:28:05,748 --> 00:28:07,547
Julian.

519
00:28:07,618 --> 00:28:09,451
What the hell
are you doing here?

520
00:28:09,489 --> 00:28:11,152
I've got to get to Ops.

521
00:28:11,192 --> 00:28:13,059
You'll never make it.

522
00:28:13,095 --> 00:28:14,563
Well, I-I got to do something.

523
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:16,432
I can't just let
the Lethean kill me.

524
00:28:16,469 --> 00:28:19,236
The Lethean's too strong,
too fast.

525
00:28:19,275 --> 00:28:20,607
He's going to kill us all.

526
00:28:21,746 --> 00:28:24,377
You sound awfully sure of that.

527
00:28:24,418 --> 00:28:26,513
Well, I know you're
not going to stop him.

528
00:28:26,556 --> 00:28:27,956
Well, look at you!

529
00:28:27,992 --> 00:28:30,623
You look like you've got
one foot in the grave already.

530
00:28:32,066 --> 00:28:33,592
I'll tell you something...

531
00:28:33,703 --> 00:28:35,730
I like the real Chief
better than you.

532
00:28:40,216 --> 00:28:41,377
Where are you going?

533
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:43,889
I'm going to try and find
a way out of these conduits.

534
00:28:43,924 --> 00:28:46,019
It's hard enough
to for me to walk

535
00:28:46,061 --> 00:28:47,029
let alone crawl.

536
00:28:47,063 --> 00:28:48,190
Mind if I come along?

537
00:28:48,233 --> 00:28:49,964
I thought you said
I didn't have a chance.

538
00:28:50,002 --> 00:28:52,302
Well, I'm hoping I was wrong.

539
00:28:52,341 --> 00:28:53,832
So am I.

540
00:28:53,877 --> 00:28:55,676
But somehow, I doubt it.

541
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:17,450
How did we get back here?

542
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:18,618
You tell me.

543
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,889
It's your mind.

544
00:29:22,835 --> 00:29:24,771
This monitor...

545
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:26,638
it's displaying my vital signs.

546
00:29:26,676 --> 00:29:28,942
And what's the prognosis?

547
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,948
Pulse is thready.

548
00:29:29,982 --> 00:29:32,545
Blood pressure
is dropping steadily.

549
00:29:33,924 --> 00:29:36,156
I'm dying.

550
00:29:36,194 --> 00:29:38,164
I could have told you that
just by looking at you.

551
00:29:38,198 --> 00:29:39,188
Ha!

552
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:49,821
Pardon me.

553
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:51,722
Excuse me, excuse me.
Pardon.

554
00:29:56,134 --> 00:29:59,573
Can I offer you gentlemen
a drink?

555
00:29:59,608 --> 00:30:02,705
Quark, where did all
these people come from?

556
00:30:02,781 --> 00:30:04,410
Just goes to show...

557
00:30:04,452 --> 00:30:08,722
give the people what they want
and they'll show up in droves.

558
00:30:08,793 --> 00:30:11,127
Now, care to place a wager?

559
00:30:11,164 --> 00:30:13,327
A wager? On what?

560
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,272
You name it.

561
00:30:15,306 --> 00:30:17,742
On how much longer
you have to live.

562
00:30:17,778 --> 00:30:19,441
What organ will fail first.

563
00:30:19,482 --> 00:30:21,179
Ultimate cause of death.

564
00:30:21,218 --> 00:30:23,620
The house is covering all bets.

565
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:27,255
What if I want to bet
that I will survive?

566
00:30:27,296 --> 00:30:30,632
Hmm. It's a long shot

567
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,867
but if you want
to throw your money away

568
00:30:32,908 --> 00:30:34,537
who am I to stop you?

569
00:30:34,578 --> 00:30:36,069
Dabo!

570
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,924
Uh-oh.

571
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:45,363
It looks like all bets are off.

572
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,165
No! No!

573
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,350
Everyone loses.

574
00:31:08,847 --> 00:31:12,981
Oh, Garak, the Lethean
is in Quark's.

575
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:15,457
Well, he hasn't caught
you yet, Doctor.

576
00:31:15,494 --> 00:31:17,259
Let's get you out of here.

577
00:31:17,296 --> 00:31:19,061
I've got to get to Ops.

578
00:31:20,737 --> 00:31:22,035
What's wrong?

579
00:31:22,073 --> 00:31:23,940
I don't believe it.

580
00:31:23,977 --> 00:31:26,642
I've broken my hip.

581
00:31:26,682 --> 00:31:28,515
I can't walk.

582
00:31:33,696 --> 00:31:37,568
Well, Doctor, it was a good game
while it lasted.

583
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,597
I've got to keep moving.

584
00:31:39,642 --> 00:31:42,044
And how do you propose
doing that, hmm?

585
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:44,379
You're going to help me.

586
00:31:45,787 --> 00:31:48,816
I admire your tenacity,
Doctor, but it's over.

587
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,021
Look at yourself.

588
00:31:50,062 --> 00:31:52,055
Your bones are
as brittle as twigs.

589
00:31:52,099 --> 00:31:53,796
You can't catch your breath.

590
00:31:53,836 --> 00:31:56,967
You can't even stand,
let alone walk.

591
00:31:57,009 --> 00:32:00,574
But other than that,
I feel wonderful.

592
00:32:00,617 --> 00:32:04,021
Now, are you going
to give me a hand, or not?

593
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:05,959
It would be my privilege.

594
00:32:05,994 --> 00:32:07,793
Now, what would
you like me to do?

595
00:32:07,831 --> 00:32:09,265
Get me up!

596
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,963
Of course... come on.

597
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:16,043
All right?
Let's go.

598
00:32:16,081 --> 00:32:17,413
Okay, come on.

599
00:32:30,644 --> 00:32:32,807
Anybody home?

600
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,654
All right, Doctor, here we go.

601
00:32:36,689 --> 00:32:39,354
Easy, now.

602
00:32:39,394 --> 00:32:41,193
That's it.

603
00:32:41,231 --> 00:32:43,064
Good.

604
00:32:52,386 --> 00:32:54,822
Surprise!

605
00:32:54,858 --> 00:32:57,421
What is this?

606
00:32:57,463 --> 00:33:02,167
Happy birthday to you

607
00:33:02,206 --> 00:33:06,773
Happy birthday
to you

608
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:14,161
Happy birthday, dear Julian

609
00:33:14,197 --> 00:33:19,971
Happy birthday to you

610
00:33:21,111 --> 00:33:25,108
And many more.

611
00:33:25,152 --> 00:33:27,588
I really must
congratulate you, Doctor.

612
00:33:27,624 --> 00:33:29,924
You have a fascinating mind.

613
00:33:29,962 --> 00:33:34,927
I'm sorry, but I really
haven't got time for this.

614
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:37,671
But it's a party
and it's all for you.

615
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:40,342
You must try to enjoy yourself.

616
00:33:40,382 --> 00:33:42,045
It's your birthday.

617
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:43,145
Garak...

618
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:47,629
get me over
to the engineering station.

619
00:33:47,664 --> 00:33:49,258
Now!

620
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,894
Sorry, dear.

621
00:33:50,937 --> 00:33:53,373
Come along, Doctor.

622
00:33:55,045 --> 00:33:56,674
That's it.

623
00:33:58,018 --> 00:33:59,452
Good.

624
00:34:01,224 --> 00:34:04,219
There must be a way
to reactivate

625
00:34:04,263 --> 00:34:05,930
the central computer network.

626
00:34:06,063 --> 00:34:08,933
Any ideas on how to go
about doing that?

627
00:34:10,372 --> 00:34:13,003
My engineering
extension courses

628
00:34:13,044 --> 00:34:15,014
at Starfleet Medical...

629
00:34:15,048 --> 00:34:21,084
focused mainly on...
Starship operations.

630
00:34:21,127 --> 00:34:26,035
But I think if I can...
can reroute...

631
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:30,010
reroute the...

632
00:34:30,045 --> 00:34:32,573
central command processor

633
00:34:32,617 --> 00:34:37,058
I might be able
to bypass the disabled systems

634
00:34:37,092 --> 00:34:41,659
and... get it operational.

635
00:34:41,768 --> 00:34:46,676
So what panel accesses
the computer?

636
00:34:46,778 --> 00:34:51,482
If you were really Garak,
you could tell me.

637
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,551
In fact, you could
fix this computer

638
00:34:55,596 --> 00:34:56,928
without my help.

639
00:34:56,965 --> 00:34:59,265
But I'm not really Garak, am I?

640
00:34:59,303 --> 00:35:01,500
I'm just another part of you.

641
00:35:03,377 --> 00:35:05,643
Help me get this panel...

642
00:35:05,716 --> 00:35:06,843
this panel off.

643
00:35:12,897 --> 00:35:15,767
My... tennis balls.

644
00:35:15,803 --> 00:35:19,402
Well, this station is in worse
condition than we thought.

645
00:35:19,443 --> 00:35:21,037
Garak...

646
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:26,045
the computer controls are
behind one of these panels.

647
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,583
I just have to find
the right ones.

648
00:35:28,629 --> 00:35:29,927
Face it, Doctor...

649
00:35:29,964 --> 00:35:32,366
there's no way to repair
all this damage.

650
00:35:32,402 --> 00:35:33,870
It's much too extensive.

651
00:35:35,074 --> 00:35:36,440
Here.

652
00:35:36,477 --> 00:35:42,115
If you won't help me...
I'll do it myself.

653
00:35:42,155 --> 00:35:43,852
I'd be more than willing
to help you

654
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,885
if I thought it would
accomplish anything

655
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:50,268
but you're only delaying
the inevitable.

656
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:03,090
That doesn't sound
like the Garak I know.

657
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:04,690
We've been through this, Doctor.

658
00:36:04,767 --> 00:36:07,067
I'm not Garak.
I'm you.

659
00:36:07,105 --> 00:36:11,877
Well, it doesn't sound
like me either.

660
00:36:26,443 --> 00:36:29,347
I've been thinking.

661
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:36,429
Why did the Lethean
let you live, hmm?

662
00:36:36,463 --> 00:36:42,533
He killed everyone else
who could have helped me.

663
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:49,283
Exactly what part of me
do you represent?

664
00:36:49,323 --> 00:36:50,952
Is it my conscience?

665
00:36:50,993 --> 00:36:55,697
My curiosity?
Hmm? Is it?

666
00:36:55,736 --> 00:36:59,608
Is it my... sense of humor?

667
00:37:04,854 --> 00:37:06,585
You tell me.

668
00:37:06,623 --> 00:37:11,656
I don't think
that you are any part of me.

669
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:18,875
In fact, I don't even think
you belong here... at all.

670
00:37:20,551 --> 00:37:24,787
Which leaves me
with just one question.

671
00:37:24,861 --> 00:37:28,801
Who are you?

672
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,381
You've put up an entertaining
struggle, Doctor.

673
00:37:37,419 --> 00:37:40,414
Well, I'm glad you
enjoyed yourself.

674
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,951
Now it's time to make things
easy on yourself.

675
00:37:42,997 --> 00:37:45,229
Oh, you mean just give up?

676
00:37:45,268 --> 00:37:46,759
I don't think so.

677
00:37:46,805 --> 00:37:48,638
Why not?

678
00:37:48,674 --> 00:37:51,305
Isn't that what
you've always done?

679
00:37:51,346 --> 00:37:54,182
Remember, Doctor...

680
00:37:54,219 --> 00:37:57,954
I am inside your head.

681
00:37:57,993 --> 00:38:00,556
I know all about you.

682
00:38:02,735 --> 00:38:04,671
When you were younger...

683
00:38:04,706 --> 00:38:08,544
you wanted to be a tennis
player, didn't you?

684
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,285
I wasn't good enough
to play professionally.

685
00:38:16,063 --> 00:38:18,260
Don't lie to me.

686
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,632
Not in here.

687
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:22,804
You were good enough

688
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:25,610
but you knew your parents
wouldn't approve of it.

689
00:38:25,648 --> 00:38:28,211
So you gave up.

690
00:38:28,254 --> 00:38:32,251
And you became a doctor instead.

691
00:38:32,295 --> 00:38:34,128
I love medicine.

692
00:38:38,875 --> 00:38:41,711
But you loved tennis more.

693
00:38:44,252 --> 00:38:46,780
And what about medical school?

694
00:38:47,927 --> 00:38:50,660
You should have been
first in your class.

695
00:38:50,698 --> 00:38:52,668
What went wrong?

696
00:38:52,702 --> 00:38:55,070
I made a mistake.

697
00:38:55,107 --> 00:38:56,906
In the final exam.

698
00:38:56,945 --> 00:38:59,074
You mistook
a preganglionic fiber

699
00:38:59,115 --> 00:39:00,914
for a postganglionic nerve.

700
00:39:00,953 --> 00:39:03,219
That's right.

701
00:39:05,595 --> 00:39:08,624
But preganglionic fibers
and postganglionic nerves

702
00:39:08,667 --> 00:39:10,033
aren't anything alike.

703
00:39:10,071 --> 00:39:14,375
Any first-year medical student
could tell them apart.

704
00:39:14,412 --> 00:39:16,814
You purposely answered
the question wrong.

705
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:19,686
That's...
that's ridiculous.

706
00:39:24,532 --> 00:39:27,129
You didn't want to be
first in your class.

707
00:39:27,171 --> 00:39:28,902
You couldn't take the pressure.

708
00:39:28,975 --> 00:39:30,842
That's not true.

709
00:39:30,879 --> 00:39:33,008
Isn't it?

710
00:39:35,421 --> 00:39:38,222
Then let's talk
about Lieutenant Dax.

711
00:39:40,498 --> 00:39:43,129
You like her, don't you?

712
00:39:44,172 --> 00:39:46,769
She's my friend.

713
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:49,475
But she could have
been a lot more

714
00:39:49,516 --> 00:39:52,147
if you'd tried a little harder.

715
00:39:52,188 --> 00:39:55,592
But you'd rather
give up than fight

716
00:39:55,628 --> 00:39:56,960
wouldn't you?

717
00:39:57,031 --> 00:40:00,197
We'll see about that.

718
00:40:00,237 --> 00:40:03,471
Wait.
Where are you going?

719
00:40:12,528 --> 00:40:14,657
What do you think you're doing?

720
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:16,828
The mistake I made...

721
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,772
was trying...

722
00:40:18,807 --> 00:40:22,440
to repair the station from Ops.

723
00:40:22,482 --> 00:40:26,013
It may be the nerve center
of the real world

724
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:30,029
but this is the center
of my world.

725
00:40:30,131 --> 00:40:31,998
Get away from that panel.

726
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:37,234
Or what? Hmm?

727
00:40:37,278 --> 00:40:39,248
You'll kill me?

728
00:40:39,282 --> 00:40:40,716
Go ahead.

729
00:40:40,751 --> 00:40:44,486
You've had plenty
of opportunities so far.

730
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:51,195
I don't think that it
is as easy for you...

731
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:53,802
as you say it is.

732
00:40:53,844 --> 00:40:57,944
Ah...

733
00:40:57,986 --> 00:41:04,956
You know, you don't look half
as threatening in normal light.

734
00:41:06,837 --> 00:41:08,684
Take a close look, Doctor.

735
00:41:08,817 --> 00:41:11,287
You're dying.

736
00:41:11,323 --> 00:41:12,986
Why can't you just accept it?

737
00:41:13,026 --> 00:41:16,989
Because that
is what you want me to do.

738
00:41:17,034 --> 00:41:21,942
You may be inside my head,
but you don't know me

739
00:41:21,977 --> 00:41:24,744
half as well
as you think you do.

740
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:30,121
Take Dax...
I do have feelings for her.

741
00:41:32,398 --> 00:41:36,395
But the important thing is
she's my friend.

742
00:41:36,439 --> 00:41:39,775
You know? Friend? Hmm?

743
00:41:39,846 --> 00:41:44,287
And I wouldn't exchange
that friendship for anything.

744
00:41:44,322 --> 00:41:46,792
As far as my career is concerned

745
00:41:46,827 --> 00:41:49,560
I may have been
a good tennis player

746
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,366
but I am a great doctor.

747
00:41:52,405 --> 00:41:55,809
Maybe I could have been
first in my class

748
00:41:55,911 --> 00:42:00,079
but it wouldn't have changed
anything in my life.

749
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,524
I still would have chosen
this assignment.

750
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,691
This is where I belong.

751
00:42:09,004 --> 00:42:15,940
Computer... activate
quarantine field 3-J.

752
00:42:19,993 --> 00:42:22,429
You can't do this.

753
00:42:22,465 --> 00:42:26,132
I can do anything I want.

754
00:42:26,172 --> 00:42:28,608
It is my mind.

755
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:34,484
Begin sterilization.

756
00:42:47,214 --> 00:42:49,207
Julian.

757
00:42:50,421 --> 00:42:51,514
He's awake.

758
00:42:51,556 --> 00:42:53,617
His vital signs have stabilized.

759
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,220
His brain wave activity's
normal.

760
00:42:55,264 --> 00:42:57,291
Welcome back, Doctor.

761
00:43:01,676 --> 00:43:05,548
You will never believe
where I've been.

762
00:43:08,757 --> 00:43:11,820
As for the real Altovar,
he tripped a security alert

763
00:43:11,863 --> 00:43:13,560
when he broke
into the Infirmary.

764
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,663
Barely got two meters
before Odo arrested him.

765
00:43:16,706 --> 00:43:19,610
Well, it sounds as if he were
more dangerous in your mind

766
00:43:19,645 --> 00:43:20,840
than he was in the real world.

767
00:43:20,948 --> 00:43:22,781
Actually, I did
some checking on Letheans.

768
00:43:22,818 --> 00:43:25,585
Their telepathic attacks
are almost always fatal.

769
00:43:25,624 --> 00:43:26,717
I guess I was lucky.

770
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,789
Cardassians don't believe
in luck, Doctor.

771
00:43:29,832 --> 00:43:32,633
You survived
because you're strong.

772
00:43:32,671 --> 00:43:34,470
One thing's for sure, you know...

773
00:43:34,509 --> 00:43:37,413
after experiencing life
at a hundred plus

774
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,716
turning 30 doesn't seem
that bad anymore.

775
00:43:40,754 --> 00:43:43,247
In that case, happy birthday.

776
00:43:46,766 --> 00:43:50,638
You know, Doctor,
what I find most fascinating

777
00:43:50,674 --> 00:43:55,241
about this entire incident
is how your unconscious mind

778
00:43:55,284 --> 00:43:57,481
chose people you know
to represent

779
00:43:57,521 --> 00:43:59,650
the various parts
of your personality.

780
00:43:59,692 --> 00:44:02,060
Yeah, it did make
things interesting.

781
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:05,592
And what I find interesting
is how your mind ended up

782
00:44:05,637 --> 00:44:07,971
casting me
in the role of the villain.

783
00:44:08,008 --> 00:44:11,003
Oh, I wouldn't read
too much into that, Garak.

784
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:12,984
Oh, how can I not?

785
00:44:13,018 --> 00:44:17,083
To think, after all this time,
all our lunches together

786
00:44:17,127 --> 00:44:19,029
you still don't trust me.

787
00:44:21,936 --> 00:44:24,840
There's hope for you yet,
Doctor.
