1
00:00:01,794 --> 00:00:03,671
Can I interest you in some
more Yigrish cream pie?

2
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:05,923
No, thank you, Doctor.
I'm quite full.

3
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:07,842
But you've hardly
touched your food.

4
00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:10,636
Well, the truth is I'm trying
to lose a little weight.

5
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:12,220
Hemming women's dresses

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,181
may provide me
with a modest income,

7
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:17,184
but it offers very little
in the way of exercise.

8
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,102
Well, if you like,
I can help you set up
an exercise program

9
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,562
in one of the holosuites.

10
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:23,022
I might just take
you up on that.

11
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:26,318
And, uh, speaking
of holosuites...

12
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:27,569
happy birthday.

13
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,947
I know it's a few days off,

14
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,783
but I wanted to give you
your present early.

15
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:35,703
It's a Cardassian
holosuite program.

16
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:39,039
An adaptation of one
of Shoggoth's enigma tales.

17
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,749
Is it? I see.

18
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,793
Well, you sound
disappointed.

19
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:45,921
I thought you enjoyed
mystery novels.

20
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,506
I do.

21
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,842
<i>Human</i> mystery novels.

22
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:52,511
The trouble
with Cardassian enigma tales

23
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,262
is that they all end
the same way--

24
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,557
all the suspects
are always guilty.

25
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,434
Yes, but the challenge
is determining

26
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,312
exactly who is guilty of what.

27
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:08,151
(<i> sighs</i> )
Is Lieutenant Dax

28
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:11,530
throwing one of her
surprise parties
for you this year?

29
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,365
Oh. So I'm told.

30
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,951
Well, you don't sound
enthusiastic about that either.

31
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,995
Well, it's not
that I don't appreciate

32
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,830
all the trouble she goes to
and everything.

33
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,792
It's just that... this year
is a little different.

34
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,044
How so?

35
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:27,504
This will be my 30th birthday.

36
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,297
And?

37
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:32,259
Well...
in many human cultures

38
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,012
the 30th birthday is considered
a sort of landmark.

39
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,681
It marks the end of youth

40
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:42,269
and the beginning of
the slow march into middle age.

41
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,605
And that's considered bad?

42
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,524
No. It's just
that when you hit 30,

43
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:52,153
it becomes harder and harder
to ignore the passage of time.

44
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:57,284
I wasn't aware
that humans saw growing old
as a negative experience.

45
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,078
On Cardassia,

46
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:03,665
advanced age is seen
as a sign of power, dignity.

47
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,835
Well, I am aware that aging
is part of the natural
process of life.

48
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,088
It's just that I don't want to
be reminded of it, that's all.

49
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:11,799
And look, Garak,
in two days, I turn 30.

50
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,926
If I choose to be
grumpy about it,
that's my prerogative.

51
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:17,137
By all means, Doctor,
be as grumpy as you like.

52
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,098
Well, thank you
for the support.

53
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:20,432
Excuse me, Doctor.

54
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,516
What?!

55
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,144
Oh, Quark, I'm sorry.

56
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,896
How can I help you?

57
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:29,817
Um... my friend
Altovar here

58
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:32,903
is looking to purchase
a small quantity of...

59
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,780
<i>(quietly):</i>
bio-mimetic gel.

60
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,324
And I was wondering if,
uh, you might be able

61
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,076
to tell him
where he can find

62
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:43,163
let's say, uh... a few
hundred milliliters.

63
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,874
Bio-mimetic gel
is a restricted substance.

64
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,585
Its sale is strictly prohibited
by Federation law.

65
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,629
I thought so.

66
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,547
You see?
I told you.

67
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,138
I'm willing to pay
whatever's necessary.

68
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:02,516
Name your price.

69
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,476
Why do you need it?

70
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,520
That's my business.

71
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,314
Oh. Well, I am sorry,

72
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,025
but bio-mimetic gel

73
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:13,401
can be hazardous
if handled incorrectly.

74
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:16,780
It's not for sale...
at any price.

75
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,240
Well... we tried.

76
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,408
Thank you, Doctor.

77
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,536
Quark...

78
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,371
you might want
to warn your friend

79
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,915
that even attempting
to obtain bio-mimetic gel

80
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,876
is a felony
under Federation law.

81
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,418
I know.
I told him that,

82
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,546
but he insisted
I ask you anyway.

83
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,298
Letheans can be
incredibly stubborn.

84
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,177
I... hope

85
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:39,553
you'll forgive
the interruption.

86
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:40,721
Of course.

87
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,643
You know...

88
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:50,147
we just introduced
a new lunch menu at the bar...

89
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,857
Good-bye, Quark.

90
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,984
Don't take
it personally.

91
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,569
He's turning 30.

92
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,493
Lights.

93
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,037
What do you think
you're doing here?

94
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,163
(<i> growling</i> )

95
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,378
(<i> groaning</i> )

(<i> groans</i> )

97
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,141
Bashir to Security.

98
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,728
Oh...

99
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,903
Bashir to Ops.

100
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,784
This is Doctor Bashir.
Can anyone read me?

101
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:57,751
Computer,
locate Commander Sisko.

102
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,296
Computer, respond.

103
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,967
Computer...

104
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,019
(<i> eerie</i>
<i>whispering voices</i> )

105
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,271
Hello?

106
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,192
Is somebody there?

107
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,409
Hello?

108
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:39,584
(<i> whispering continues</i> )

109
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,628
Is there anybody there?

110
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,550
Where is everybody?

Quark?

121
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:48,611
It's all right.
It's me, Bashir.

122
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,864
Okay. What is it?

123
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,199
What's going on?
Tell me.

124
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,784
He's going to kill us.

125
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,995
He's going to
kill us all.

126
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,456
Who?
Who are you so afraid of?

127
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,837
Where's Sisko? What happened
to the rest of the crew?

128
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,088
(<i> crashing</i> )

129
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,299
Why don't you
come with me?

130
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,968
We'll go and try
to find them.

131
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,720
No...

132
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,472
don't you see?

133
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:19,142
If we move, he'll find us.

134
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,894
(<i> panting</i> )

135
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,980
If we stay here,

136
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,149
we might be safe.

137
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,068
Safe?

138
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,404
From whom?

139
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:33,614
Quark, you have got to tell me.

140
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:37,452
(<i> louder crashing</i> )

141
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:38,870
He's here.

142
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,455
We've got to find a way

143
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,706
to put these lights back on.

144
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,000
It's too late.
He's found us.

145
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,960
We've got to get out.

146
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,628
(<i> yelling</i> )
Wait!

147
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,258
Who's there?
Show yourself!

Quark?

151
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,145
Quark.

152
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,955
Tarkalean tea.

153
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,999
(<i> scraping noise</i> )

154
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,336
Constable?

155
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,396
Garak!

156
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,482
Doctor! What are
you doing here?

157
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,484
I was about to ask you
the same question.

158
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,235
I was looking
for Constable Odo.

159
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,112
Everyone on this station
seems to have disappeared.

160
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,531
Not everyone.
I just saw Quark
cowering behind his bar.

161
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,241
He believes that someone
is terrorizing the station,

162
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,951
and I'm not sure
I disagree with him.

163
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,953
What do you mean?
Tell me, what's going on?

164
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,872
There is some
<i>thing</i> in Quark's
tearing up the place.

165
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,584
I didn't get a really good look
at it, but believe me,
it was not friendly.

166
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,461
Computer...
It's no use.

167
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,796
As far as I can tell,
the station has suffered

168
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,465
a massive systems failure.

169
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:16,009
Aside from life support
and simple functions

170
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,178
like turbolifts and doors,
nothing seems to work.

171
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,054
It's been like that for hours.

172
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,099
I was up late, programming
some replicator patterns

173
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,394
for a suit I'm designing,
when everything went dead.

174
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,938
I can't believe
that you, Quark and I

175
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,815
are the only people
left on this station.

176
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,067
Sisko and the others
must be around somewhere.

177
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:37,405
Maybe. Or maybe they've
fallen victim to some kind
of rampant virus.

178
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,659
Or space anomaly,
or Dominion plot.

179
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,869
All the more reason
to try and locate them.

180
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,579
(<i> eerie whispering voices</i> )

181
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,541
Wait...

182
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,250
do you hear that?

183
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:52,629
Hear what?

184
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,965
That sound...

185
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,135
it's like voices...
whispering.

186
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,845
I don't hear
anything.

187
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,639
But then,
Cardassian hearing

188
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,141
is not quite as
acute as humans.

189
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,767
Doctor, are you
feeling all right?

190
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,103
You look...
different somehow.

191
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,814
What is it?
Your hair...

192
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,316
it seems to be turning gray.

193
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,610
So I've noticed.
I guess you had reason

194
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,363
to feel worried about
turning 30, after all.

195
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,823
Either that, or your job
is even more stressful
than I'd thought.

196
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,950
Look, Garak, we haven't
got time for this.

197
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,661
We've got to find out
what's going on here.

198
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,621
I agree. Perhaps
we should split up.

199
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,289
I can search
the Docking Ring

200
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,748
while you look around
the Habitat Ring

201
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,376
and the Central Core.

202
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,294
I'll meet you back
on the Promenade in an hour.

203
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,921
Be careful.
You, too.

204
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,424
And, Doctor,
try to relax.

205
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:02,240
(<i> machinery</i>
<i>powering down</i> )

206
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,972

(<i> pounding continues</i> )

213
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,473
DAX (<i> faintly</i> ):
Look, what are we doing
standing around here?

214
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,309
O'BRIEN:
What do you want to do,
rush out and get us all killed?

215
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:14,437
DAX:
It's better than doing nothing.
Let's go.

216
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:17,940
ODO: Or follow you
right into a trap.
Is that what you want?

217
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,900
KIRA:
You're all crazy.

218
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,028
None of this is helping us
deal with the Lethean.

219
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:25,365
DAX:
Well, I don't see you
coming up with anything.

220
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:28,242
KIRA:
If you'd all stop talking and
give me some time to think...

221
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,161
(<i> louder</i> ):
maybe I would.

222
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,830
O'BRIEN: I say we do
nothing until we get
reinforcements...

223
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,373
Julian, there you are.
Where have you been?

224
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,792
Looking for you.
Well, I'm glad you're here.

225
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,544
...the communications
system back on line.

226
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,420
It'll take hours.

227
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,963
Too many systems
have been sabotaged.

228
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,382
All my work crews
are missing.

229
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,966
And I cannot
make new parts

230
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,468
until we get the
replicators fixed.

231
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,428
The first thing
we need to do

232
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,222
is neutralize
the Lethean.

233
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,558
The Lethean?
You mean Altovar?
You know him?

234
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,643
We've met. He attacked me
in the Infirmary.

235
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,770
Well, now he's trying
to kill us all by
destroying the station.

236
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,313
What are we waiting for?

237
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,315
Let's get some phasers
and hunt him down.

238
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,068
If you ask me, none of us
are safe until he is dead.

239
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,404
If we go looking
for the Lethean, we're
the ones who'll end up dead.

240
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,239
I'll tell you what--
if we find the Lethean

241
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,990
maybe we can find you
a backbone!

242
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,577
Maybe he doesn't want us
to find the Lethean.

243
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:11,745
Maybe he's in league with him.

244
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,621
BASHIR:
Computer.

245
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,540
Scan the occupants
of this room

246
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,417
for any anomalies.

247
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,419
Doctor, what are you doing?

248
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,672
You're all acting very strangely
and I intend to find out why.

249
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,883
Computer!
Don't bother, Doctor.

250
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:27,552
For some reason, the
computer isn't working.

251
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,095
Don't go blaming me
for that, Constable.

252
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,764
None of this
would be happening

253
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:31,931
if Security
had done its job.

254
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,182
That's enough.

255
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,394
Where is Sisko?

256
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,229
Where are O'Brien's work crews?

257
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,273
I've been wandering
around this station for hours

258
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,776
and the only two people
I've seen are Quark and Garak.

259
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,069
Where is everybody else?

260
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,447
There's something
very wrong here.

261
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,532
I'd say
there is.

262
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,325
Have you looked
in a mirror lately?

263
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,327
(<i> whispering voices</i> )
Hold on.

264
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,995
Does anybody
else hear that?

265
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,664
What?

266
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,332
I don't hear
anything.

267
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,959
Garak didn't either.

268
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,253
Julian,<i> what</i> are
you talking about?

269
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:05,256
I know, I know it sounds odd,
but I keep hearing voices.

270
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,592
And he says<i> we're</i>
acting peculiar?

271
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:10,428
What are these so-called
voices saying?

272
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,513
That's just
the problem.

273
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,557
I can't make
out the words.

274
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:17,101
I think you're
the one who needs help,
Doctor, not us.

275
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,145
Maybe you
should lie down.

276
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,855
I'm fine.

277
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,107
Except... you're hearing voices.

278
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:26,694
And you've aged about 30 years
in the last few hours.

279
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,363
There must be some
logical explanation.

280
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,783
Maybe there's a virus
or a subspace anomaly

281
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:35,495
a neural inversion field,
an anaphasic parasite.

282
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,246
You keep thinking, Julian.

283
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,706
And while you try
to figure it out,

284
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,500
I'll find the Lethean
and stop him

285
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,084
from sabotaging any
of the other systems.

286
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,670
And what good will that do?

287
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,588
You have no idea
where he is.

288
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,757
We don't know what we're up
against, how strong he is,

289
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,676
if he can be hurt
by phaser fire.

290
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,261
Don't worry, Chief.
I wasn't asking for
any of your help.

291
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,305
If he's here,
I'll find him,

292
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,349
even if I have to
do it all by myself.

293
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,768
Calm down, Dax.
You're not going
anywhere.

294
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,561
No one is.
There are too many
strange things

295
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,229
going on
on this station--

296
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,565
my aging, O'Brien's
missing crew members,

297
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,860
sabotage to the station,
your abnormal behavior.

298
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,903
You think it's all
connected somehow?

299
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,280
I think we
should find out.

300
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,033
Is there any
way of getting

301
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,536
the internal
sensors on line?

302
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,747
There's a computer processing
junction near here.

303
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,917
I might be able to repair
the internal sensors from there.

304
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,588
But I'm not going alone.
Oh, what a surprise.

305
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,716
Don't worry, I'm
not letting you
out of my sight.

306
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,300
We'll all go
together.

307
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,593
Let's move.

308
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,724
(<i> sighs</i> )

309
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,609
It's even worse
than I thought.

310
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,739
The entire sensor array
is burnt out and there's
extensive damage

311
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,281
to the computer's
central processor.

312
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,450
The only system
that looks salvageable

313
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,452
is the subspace
communications relay.

314
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,747
Well, that would at least
let us contact Bajor.

315
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,665
See what you
can do, Chief.

316
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,542
Constable, would you
stop doing that?

317
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:05,919
Doing what?
Looking around like that.

318
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,712
It's getting
on my nerves.

319
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,381
There's no harm
in keeping both eyes open.

320
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,508
I don't remember
asking your opinion.

321
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,468
If the Lethean's around,
I want to know it.

322
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,554
Last time I saw him,
he was in the Central Core.

323
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,305
The Central Core?
What level were you on?

324
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,266
Level 5,
but I doubt he's still there.

325
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,393
I think I lost him.
You think?

326
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,311
Just keep working, Chief.

327
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,023
For all we know,
he could be right
outside the door.

328
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,734
And if he is,
then you'll have
led him here.

329
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,485
O'BRIEN:
Hold on, Lieutenant.

330
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,654
I think I've got the
communications relay working.

331
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,323
Open hailing frequencies.
Try to contact Bajor.

332
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,035
Hold on.
Ah, it's not working.

333
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,287
But I'm receiving
a signal.

334
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,663
Audio only.

335
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,041
Let's hear it.
I'm patching it through.

336
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:48,086
DAX:
...four cc's of cordrazine,
but there was no response.

337
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,671
That sounds like you,
Lieutenant.

338
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,548
SISKO:
There has to be something
we can do.

339
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,341
Well, that's
Sisko's voice.

340
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,469
NURSE: we've tried everything
we can think of,

341
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,972
but we haven't been able
to counteract
the telepathic damage.

342
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,723
His motor functions
are minimal...

343
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,182
Where's this signal coming from?

344
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,517
I don't know.

345
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,061
Somewhere outside
the station.

346
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,105
SISKO:
Give me the bottom line.

347
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:09,065
DAX:
The bottom line is
that Julian's in some kind

348
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,608
of telepathically-induced coma.

349
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,276
And unless we can
get him out of it,

350
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,736
he'll be dead
in less than three hours.

351
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,154
SISKO:
I'll be in my office.

352
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,948
Keep me informed.

353
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:19,033
What the hell's
going on here?

354
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,334
Delta waves.

355
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,713
When I scan myself
for brain activity,

356
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:36,258
all I get are
low-frequency delta waves.

357
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,094
O'BRIEN:
And what's that
supposed to mean?

358
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,805
It means that the voices
were telling the truth.

359
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:48,062
I'm... in a coma.

360
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:01,826
How can you stand there
and say that you're
in a coma? That's crazy.

361
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:04,078
Not necessarily, Major.

362
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:06,455
I suppose the next thing
you're going to tell us

363
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,166
is that<i> we're</i>
unconscious.

364
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,501
Not according
to these readings.

365
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:11,919
Glad to hear it.

366
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,796
Actually, I'm
not picking up

367
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,799
any life signs
from you at all.

368
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,718
Let me see that.

369
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,306
You want to know
what this means?

370
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,560
This tricorder is broken.
That's what it means.

371
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,936
I don't think so.

372
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,104
What are you
saying, Doctor?

373
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,898
That we don't exist?

374
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,274
Oh, I've had
enough of this.

375
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,235
I am not some figment
of your imagination.

376
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,945
But don't you see?

377
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,322
That is why you are all
behaving so strangely.

378
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,116
I'm not behaving
strangely.

379
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,993
Am I?

380
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,786
You all are.

381
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,081
Dax, you're not usually
the sort of person

382
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:51,542
to solve her problems by
running around with a phaser.

383
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:54,921
And, Chief,
you aren't usually
so pessimistic.

384
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,422
Look, we are
wasting time.

385
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,799
The Lethean could
be here any minute.

386
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,385
So if you're in a coma,
and we're not real,

387
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,262
then what are
we doing here?

388
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,099
Or maybe we're just here
to give him someone to talk to.

389
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,308
(<i> laughing</i> )

390
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,729
A paranoid, a coward,
a hothead and me?

391
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:14,190
Oh, you'd think he'd pick
some better company.

392
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,901
I haven't<i> picked</i>
any of you.

393
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,986
I'm in a coma.

394
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,530
I'm the only one
who's really here.

395
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,866
Which means
when I'm talking to you,

396
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,952
I'm really only
talking to myself.

397
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,870
I wish you
wouldn't say that.

398
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,915
It's the only
possible explanation.

399
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:33,417
KIRA:
So...

400
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,836
you're saying
I'm you?

401
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,046
In a manner of speaking.

402
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,173
And I suppose
he's you, too.

403
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,008
You all are.

404
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,804
You all embody different aspects
of my personality...

405
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:48,182
different voices inside my head.

406
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:51,393
I don't believe we're
having this discussion.

407
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,687
If I were to guess, Chief,

408
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,232
I would say that you
represent my doubt...

409
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:57,483
and my disbelief.

410
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,318
No, I don't!

411
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,029
I knew you were
going to say that.

412
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,074
Major... you're
the perfect choice

413
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:06,700
for my aggression.

414
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,286
And, Odo...

415
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:13,040
you represent my sense
of suspicion and fear.

416
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,500
Dax...

417
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:22,341
to me, you've always
represented my confidence...

418
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,884
and sense of adventure.

419
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:24,927
Ha!

420
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,344
Thank you, Julian.

421
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:27,721
You're forgetting
something, Doctor.

422
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,182
What about the Lethean?

423
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:31,475
What is he supposed
to represent?

424
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:35,729
I suppose he represents
the telepathic damage

425
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,107
that the real Lethean
did to my mind.

426
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,860
So why is<i> this</i> Lethean
running around

427
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,987
sabotaging
the station?

428
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:47,658
It's not the station
he's sabotaging.

429
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:50,619
It's my mind!

430
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:54,498
The station represents my mind.

431
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:58,127
Just as you represent different
aspects of my personality.

432
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:02,422
Think about it! When the Chief
fixed the communications relay,

433
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:05,509
we could hear what was happening
in the real world.

434
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,053
It's like he restored
your hearing.

435
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:08,554
Exactly.

436
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,973
So if we could repair
the station...

437
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,142
You'd wake up.

438
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:16,270
But if you wake up,
what happens to us?

439
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,105
DAX:
Julian!

440
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,565
(<i> growling</i> )
Julian!

441
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,275
Jadzia!

442
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,651
DAX:
Help me, Julian!

443
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,112
Jadzia.

444
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,114
Jadzia!

445
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,372
(<i> grunts with effort</i> )

446
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:36,040
How did I get here?

447
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,624
Oh, don't ask me.

448
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,544
After all, we're
inside<i> your</i> mind.

449
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:44,715
It's a pity
about Lieutenant Dax.

450
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:47,218
How do you know about her?

451
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:50,846
I'm a part of you, remember?
I know what you know.

452
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,973
Well...
maybe a little more.

453
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,516
Still the man
of mystery?

454
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,061
Oh, you wouldn't have me
any other way.

455
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,357
Oh, I'm getting
a little too old
for this game.

456
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,317
Yes, apparently so.

457
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:08,364
You-- or should I say "we"?--
are running out of time.

458
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,783
Your service, Doctor.

459
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,534
I can't stay here.

460
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,536
I have to get the main
computer back on line.

461
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,622
Then you'd better get to Ops.

462
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:20,293
If there are repairs to be done,
that's the place to do them.

463
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:21,961
You're right.

464
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:24,171
Try to find Kira,
Odo and O'Brien.

465
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,381
Tell them to meet me in Ops.

466
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,966
I'd be delighted.

467
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,885
I wonder if any of them
plays tennis?

468
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:39,645
(<i> people moaning</i>
<i>and coughing)</i>

469
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:47,611
MAN:
Doctor, help us.

470
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,617
SISKO:
I'll handle this,
Doctor.

471
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,998
She's suffering
cranial trauma.

472
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,334
Treat the fracture with
an osteogenic stimulator

473
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:02,835
and then follow it up with...

474
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:05,587
BOTH:
Two cc's of inpedrezine.

475
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,715
How did you know that?

476
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,678
Just doing my job.
No, you're not.

477
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,430
You're doing<i> my</i> job.
And what's more,

478
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,514
you're doing it
as well as I could.

479
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:20,102
Give him a coagulation activator
to stop the bleeding.

480
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:23,605
You represent
my professionalism...

481
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,107
and my skill.

482
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,733
I'm flattered.

483
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:30,029
Come on.

484
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:33,449
You're going to come
with me to Ops.

485
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:34,908
But I'm needed here.

486
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:40,080
I can't repair the station
without your help.

487
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,041
I suppose you're right.

488
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,751
Look after things here.
I won't be long.

489
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:45,878
Yes, sir.

490
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:48,546
No!

491
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,278
You're not going
anywhere, Doctor.

492
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,827
You're staying right here

493
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,454
trapped on this station,

494
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:23,541
watching while I destroy you
piece by piece.

495
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:26,502
And when all the best parts
of you are gone,

496
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:29,046
when there's nothing left
but the withered shell,

497
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:34,510
then, and only then, will I
put you out of your misery.

498
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,433
You can't escape, Doctor!

499
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:44,311
You can run if you want to,
but you can't outrun death.

500
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,953
Major.

501
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,329
ODO:
Doctor...

502
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,426
Odo...

503
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:17,052
what happened?

504
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,555
The Lethean.

505
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,014
He came out of nowhere.

506
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:25,685
He's trying to rob me
of my confidence.

507
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:28,355
My intelligence.

508
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,441
My strength.

509
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,445
I have to get to Ops.

510
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:36,280
Use the conduits.

511
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,282
They're your best chance.

512
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:42,077
I have to get there
while I still can.

513
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,768
Chief.

514
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,562
Julian.

515
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:10,356
What the hell
are you doing here?

516
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:12,065
I've got to get to Ops.

517
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,026
You'll never make it.

518
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,777
Well, I-I got
to do something.

519
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,737
I can't just let
the Lethean kill me.

520
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,781
The Lethean's too strong,
too fast.

521
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,408
He's going to kill us all.

522
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,742
(<i> gasping</i> )

523
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,953
You sound awfully sure of that.

You look like you've got one

527
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,588
I'll tell you something--

528

I like the real Chief
better than you.

Where are you going?

530
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,264
I'm gonna try
and find a way out
of these conduits.

531
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:47,267
It's hard enough
to for me to walk,
let alone crawl.

532
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,977

come along?

533
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,937
I thought you said
I didn't have a chance.

00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:53,190
Well, I'm hoping
I was wrong.

535

00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,610
But somehow, I doubt it.

But I'm not really
Garak, am I?

the right ones.

Face it, Doctor--

655
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,090
there's no way to repair
all this damage.

656
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,967
It's much too extensive.

If you won't help me...

00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,793
Is it my conscience?

that you are

In fact, I don't even think
you belong here... at all.

Which leaves me with
just one question.

Well, I'm glad you
enjoyed yourself.

Now it's time to make things
easy on yourself.

just give up?

but you knew your parents
wouldn't approve of it.

700
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,141
So you gave up.

701
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:32,978
And you became
a doctor instead.

00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:42,487
But you loved
tennis more.

704
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:47,242
And what about
medical school?

705
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:51,788
You should have been
first in your class.

706
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:53,748
What went wrong?

707
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,001
I made a mistake.

708
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:57,961
In the final exam.

709
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,671
You mistook
a preganglionic fiber

710
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,590
for a postganglionic nerve.

711
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,176
That's right.

712
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:08,805
But preganglionic fibers
and postganglionic nerves

713
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:10,640
aren't anything alike.

714
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,143
Any first-year
medical student

715
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:15,228
could tell them apart.

716
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,897
You purposely answered
the question wrong.

717
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,733
That's...
that's ridiculous.

718
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,991
You didn't want to be
first in your class.

719
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:29,993
You couldn't take
the pressure.

720
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,953
That's not true.

721
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:34,080
Isn't it?

722
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:39,044
Then let's talk
about Lieutenant Dax.

723
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:43,340
You like her, don't you?

724
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,802
She's my friend.

725
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,471
But she could have
been a lot more

726
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,849
if you'd tried
a little harder.

727
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:57,603
But you'd rather
give up than fight,
wouldn't you?

728
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:00,481
We'll see about that.

729
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:04,319
Wait. Where
are you going?

730
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,780
(<i> panting</i> )

731
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,747
What do you think
you're doing?

732
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,916
The mistake I made...

733
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,751
was trying...

734
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:24,089
to repair the
station from Ops.

735
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:27,050
It may be the nerve center
of the real world,

736
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,887
but<i> this</i> is
the center of my world.

737
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,847
sGet away from that panel.

738
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,936
Or what? Hmm?

739
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,729
You'll kill me?

740
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:41,356
Go ahead.

741
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:45,068
You've had plenty
of opportunities so far.

742
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:50,448
I don't think that it
is as easy for you...

743
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,410
as you say it is.

744
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:56,621
Ah...

745
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:03,711
You know, you don't look
half as threatening

746
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,755
in normal light.

747
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,675
Take a close look, Doctor.

748
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:12,137
You're dying.

749
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:14,013
Why can't you
just accept it?

750
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:18,851
Because that
is what you want me to do.

751
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,354
You may be inside my head,

752
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:22,897
but you don't know me

753
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,817
half as well as
you think you do.

754
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:31,364
Take Dax--
I do have feelings for her.

755
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:33,616
(<i> panting</i> )

756
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:37,203
But the important thing is
she's my friend.

757
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:40,706
You know? Friend? Hmm?

758
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:45,253
And I wouldn't exchange
that friendship for anything.

759
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,964
As far as my career
is concerned,

760
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:50,258
I may have been
a good tennis player,

761
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:53,345
but I am a great doctor.

762
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:57,015
Maybe I could have been
first in my class,

763
00:41:57,015 --> 00:42:01,269
but it wouldn't have changed
anything in my life.

764
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:04,356
I still would have chosen
this assignment.

765
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:08,067
This is where I belong.

766
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:16,993
Computer... activate
quarantine field 3-J.

767
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,416
You can't do this.

768
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:26,961
I can do anything I want.

769
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,547
It is<i> my</i> mind.

770
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:35,470
Begin sterilization.

771
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,847
(<i> groaning</i> )

772
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:50,026
DAX:
Julian.

773
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:52,778
He's awake.

774
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,239
His vital signs
have stabilized.

775
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,241
His brain wave
activity's normal.

776
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,117
Welcome back, Doctor.

777
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:06,543
You will never believe
where I've been.

778
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,214
As for the real Altovar,

779
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:12,798
he tripped
a security alert

780
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,592
when he broke
into the Infirmary.

781
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,136
Barely got two meters
before Odo arrested him.

782
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:19,764
Well, it sounds as if he were
more dangerous in your mind

783
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,640
than he was
in the real world.

784
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,851
Actually, I did
some checking on Letheans.

785
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,062
Their telepathic attacks
are almost always fatal.

786
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:27,564
I guess I was lucky.

787
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:30,733
Cardassians don't believe
in luck, Doctor.

788
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,611
You survived
because you're strong.

789
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,363
One thing's for
sure, you know--

790
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:38,032
after experiencing life
at a hundred plus,

791
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:41,619
turning 30 doesn't seem
that bad anymore.

792
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,080
In that case,
happy birthday.

793
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:51,670
You know, Doctor, what
I find most fascinating

794
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,214
about this entire incident

795
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:55,758
is how your
unconscious mind

796
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:58,177
chose people you know
to represent

797
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,346
the various parts
of your personality.

798
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,348
Yeah, it did make
things interesting.

799
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:06,269
And what I find interesting
is how your mind ended up

800
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:08,729
casting me
in the role of the villain.

801
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:11,941
Oh, I wouldn't read
too much into that, Garak.

802
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:13,818
Oh, how can I not?

803
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:17,947
To think, after all this time,
all our lunches together,

804
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:19,949
you still don't trust me.

805
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:27,415
There's hope for
you yet, Doctor.

806
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:29,083
(<i> chuckles</i> )
