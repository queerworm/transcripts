1
00:00:02,197 --> 00:00:03,290
Okay, that's 12 spins

2
00:00:03,332 --> 00:00:04,801
and not a single dabo so far.

3
00:00:04,836 --> 00:00:05,804
The pot is growing

4
00:00:05,838 --> 00:00:08,036
and someone's going
to be a big winner...

5
00:00:16,895 --> 00:00:18,558
Today's the day, Brother.

6
00:00:18,599 --> 00:00:20,159
I'm really going
to do it this time.

7
00:00:20,202 --> 00:00:22,069
You've been saying
that for weeks.

8
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:23,541
I've been waiting
for the right moment

9
00:00:23,576 --> 00:00:24,703
and this is it.

10
00:00:24,746 --> 00:00:25,714
Now?

11
00:00:25,748 --> 00:00:26,977
It's perfect.

12
00:00:27,017 --> 00:00:29,147
She's about to go on a break,
and when she does

13
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:31,091
she'll come over here
and say "Hi" to me...

14
00:00:31,126 --> 00:00:33,359
like she always does

15
00:00:33,398 --> 00:00:36,735
and that's when I'll do it.

16
00:00:36,772 --> 00:00:37,603
Okay, let's hear it.

17
00:00:38,844 --> 00:00:41,008
I... uh...

18
00:00:41,048 --> 00:00:43,246
Leeta, would you like...

19
00:00:43,287 --> 00:00:46,920
maybe... to... one night...

20
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:49,991
soon... to... maybe?

21
00:00:50,035 --> 00:00:51,196
Rom.

22
00:00:51,237 --> 00:00:52,729
You're a regular poet.

23
00:00:52,774 --> 00:00:54,175
I can do better.

24
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:55,976
Prove it.

25
00:00:59,021 --> 00:01:00,285
Hi, Rom.

26
00:01:00,357 --> 00:01:03,296
Hello, Leeta.

27
00:01:13,553 --> 00:01:14,988
Bye.

28
00:01:23,408 --> 00:01:25,777
I must be doing
something wrong.

29
00:01:25,814 --> 00:01:27,147
I don't know, Leeta.

30
00:01:27,183 --> 00:01:29,620
Maybe he's just not
interested in you.

31
00:01:29,655 --> 00:01:31,990
Well, I know he likes me.

32
00:01:32,027 --> 00:01:35,592
Likes you, yes,
but he's an engineer.

33
00:01:35,635 --> 00:01:37,070
A problem solver.

34
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:41,043
He needs a woman
with a body and brains.

35
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,483
I have brains.

36
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,284
Sure you do, honey.

37
00:01:45,323 --> 00:01:47,419
That's why I hired you.

38
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:51,060
Now, eat up,
and then take those brains

39
00:01:51,102 --> 00:01:52,435
back to the dabo wheel

40
00:01:52,472 --> 00:01:55,273
where the customers can get
a good, long look at them.

41
00:02:02,828 --> 00:02:04,320
Triple 20!

42
00:02:07,238 --> 00:02:10,039
Oh, he's back in the zone today.

43
00:02:10,077 --> 00:02:11,842
I never really left it.

44
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,648
Just been giving you
a chance to get even.

45
00:02:14,687 --> 00:02:17,124
Thank you,
but I don't need your charity.

46
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,856
Another game?

47
00:02:18,896 --> 00:02:20,229
Maybe one.

48
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:21,427
I promised Molly

49
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:23,336
I'd do some coloring
with her this afternoon.

50
00:02:23,373 --> 00:02:25,104
With all this attention
focused on the baby

51
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:26,670
I don't want her
to start feeling

52
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:27,739
that we've forgotten
about her.

53
00:02:27,783 --> 00:02:29,275
A father's work is never done.

54
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,755
You said it.

55
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,227
Still, it's worth it.

56
00:02:33,262 --> 00:02:35,631
You should give it
a try sometime.

57
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:37,000
Me? No.

58
00:02:37,036 --> 00:02:38,369
Why not?

59
00:02:38,406 --> 00:02:39,966
I bet you'd make a great father.

60
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,177
I'm not exactly a family type.

61
00:02:43,217 --> 00:02:44,948
Dr. Bashir, I presume?

62
00:02:44,988 --> 00:02:46,821
That's me.

63
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:47,826
I'm Louis Zimmerman

64
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,093
director of holographic imaging
and programming

65
00:02:50,132 --> 00:02:53,071
at the Jupiter Research Station,
and I'm here to make you...

66
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:54,472
immortal.

67
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,602
You're familiar, of course

68
00:04:59,646 --> 00:05:02,413
with the Emergency
Medical Holographic program.

69
00:05:02,453 --> 00:05:03,421
I've heard of it.

70
00:05:03,455 --> 00:05:05,448
It's a hologram designed
to provide assistance

71
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:07,087
during emergencies
in Sick Bay.

72
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,226
It does much more
than provide assistance.

73
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,361
A holographic doctor

74
00:05:10,404 --> 00:05:12,841
can literally replace
a starship's medical officer

75
00:05:12,876 --> 00:05:13,969
during an emergency.

76
00:05:14,011 --> 00:05:16,847
I'm surprised you don't
have one on the station.

77
00:05:16,885 --> 00:05:19,482
The station facilities
are Cardassian in origin.

78
00:05:19,524 --> 00:05:21,494
Most of our equipment
is incompatible

79
00:05:21,561 --> 00:05:23,053
with Federation technology.

80
00:05:23,098 --> 00:05:24,191
How unfortunate for you.

81
00:05:24,234 --> 00:05:26,204
In any case,
the original EMH program

82
00:05:26,238 --> 00:05:27,969
was designed
for short-term use only

83
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:30,070
but now Starfleet
has requested a program

84
00:05:30,114 --> 00:05:32,210
designed to operate
as a full-time doctor.

85
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:33,652
Full time?

86
00:05:33,688 --> 00:05:36,889
You're not talking
about replacing real doctors?

87
00:05:36,929 --> 00:05:37,919
No, no, of course not.

88
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:39,228
Why is everyone so worried

89
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:41,294
about holograms taking
over the universe?

90
00:05:41,338 --> 00:05:43,536
There are many situations
where a holo-doctor

91
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:45,547
could be more beneficial
than a humanoid.

92
00:05:45,647 --> 00:05:46,706
Research outposts

93
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,689
subspace communication stations

94
00:05:49,723 --> 00:05:51,249
long-range exploratory vessels.

95
00:05:51,293 --> 00:05:53,092
In short,
anywhere that life support

96
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,291
or living space is at a premium

97
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:55,393
and where the primary mission

98
00:05:55,436 --> 00:05:57,235
does not require the doctor
to leave Sick Bay.

99
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,434
I see.

100
00:05:58,476 --> 00:06:00,970
And they want to model
this new EMH program

101
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:02,142
after Dr. Bashir.

102
00:06:02,184 --> 00:06:03,710
Technically, it is an LMH...

103
00:06:03,754 --> 00:06:05,690
Long-term Medical
Holographic program.

104
00:06:05,725 --> 00:06:08,390
And, yes, Starfleet Medical
has selected Dr. Bashir

105
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:09,764
to provide the template.

106
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,827
Who was the template
for the EMH?

107
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:12,965
Me.

108
00:06:13,008 --> 00:06:14,443
It was my program after all.

109
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:17,143
It only seemed logical
to use myself as a model.

110
00:06:17,183 --> 00:06:18,812
Of course.

111
00:06:18,854 --> 00:06:20,756
This must be quite an honor.

112
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:21,759
Yes, it... is

113
00:06:21,794 --> 00:06:24,664
quite a feather in my cap, sir.

114
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,570
It is nothing less than
a shot at immortality.

115
00:06:27,674 --> 00:06:29,303
The original EMH program
will probably

116
00:06:29,344 --> 00:06:30,938
still be in use
for decades to come.

117
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:34,386
The LMH will undoubtedly
last far longer than that.

118
00:06:34,422 --> 00:06:37,827
That is, if I can work out
certain technical problems.

119
00:06:37,862 --> 00:06:41,267
Now, I'll need to remain here
for at least three weeks.

120
00:06:41,303 --> 00:06:43,547
I'll need quarters,
access to your main computer

121
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,274
a technician
to install my equipment

122
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:47,014
a high-speed data link
with my lab...

123
00:06:47,054 --> 00:06:49,081
Doctor, my First Officer,
Major Kira

124
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,685
will see to all your needs.

125
00:06:52,032 --> 00:06:53,433
Congratulations, Doctor.

126
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:55,997
I know I speak
for everyone on the station

127
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,239
when I say we're really
very proud of you.

128
00:06:58,278 --> 00:06:59,337
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

129
00:06:59,448 --> 00:07:00,609
Let's go.

130
00:07:06,196 --> 00:07:08,599
This is a long questionnaire.

131
00:07:08,635 --> 00:07:11,402
I pride myself
on my attention to detail.

132
00:07:11,441 --> 00:07:13,776
Let's see...
"compare and contrast

133
00:07:13,813 --> 00:07:17,150
"your eating habits at age five
with those of ten

134
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,416
15, 20 and 25."

135
00:07:18,457 --> 00:07:21,658
It will be necessary
for the holo-doctor

136
00:07:21,697 --> 00:07:23,998
to interact naturally
with patients for weeks

137
00:07:24,035 --> 00:07:25,196
possibly even months.

138
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:28,211
The doctor will be expected
to share amusing anecdotes

139
00:07:28,244 --> 00:07:30,943
extend sympathy,
swap dirty jokes

140
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,854
and even have culinary opinions
formed by experience.

141
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,986
You mean this program
is going to include

142
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:37,896
all his personal
likes and dislikes?

143
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:39,994
That is why we bother to choose

144
00:07:40,037 --> 00:07:42,372
a human template
in the first place.

145
00:07:42,476 --> 00:07:44,139
Wow.
Think of it, Julian.

146
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:46,912
If this thing works,
you'll be able to irritate

147
00:07:46,953 --> 00:07:49,356
hundreds of people
you've never even met.

148
00:07:50,694 --> 00:07:51,993
If you two could suspend

149
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,194
your oh-so-amusing banter
for the moment

150
00:07:54,235 --> 00:07:56,729
I'd like to begin
the optical parameter scans.

151
00:07:56,774 --> 00:07:58,403
What do you want me to do?

152
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,938
Just stand there
and look like a doctor.

153
00:08:01,952 --> 00:08:03,945
If you can.

154
00:08:06,295 --> 00:08:07,628
Dabo!

155
00:08:10,271 --> 00:08:11,934
We don't have
anything like this

156
00:08:11,974 --> 00:08:12,999
on Jupiter Station.

157
00:08:13,043 --> 00:08:14,170
Or like her.

158
00:08:14,212 --> 00:08:15,647
She's beautiful, isn't she?

159
00:08:15,682 --> 00:08:16,843
Who is she?

160
00:08:16,885 --> 00:08:18,184
Her name's Leeta.

161
00:08:18,221 --> 00:08:19,781
My ex-girlfriend.

162
00:08:22,297 --> 00:08:23,526
Who broke it off?

163
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:24,762
She did.

164
00:08:24,802 --> 00:08:28,503
Oh. I like her already.

165
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:38,997
I think I'll have to add her
name to my list of interviews.

166
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:40,160
Interviews?

167
00:08:40,202 --> 00:08:42,298
I'll be conducting
in-depth interviews

168
00:08:42,341 --> 00:08:44,904
with your friends,
colleagues, family members

169
00:08:44,946 --> 00:08:47,042
in order to build
a more rounded

170
00:08:47,085 --> 00:08:49,454
psychological profile
for the LMH.

171
00:08:49,523 --> 00:08:51,459
I see.

172
00:08:51,527 --> 00:08:54,466
Well, regarding
my family members, um...

173
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,834
would you refrain from...

174
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,669
Excuse me
for interrupting, Doctor.

175
00:08:57,707 --> 00:08:58,732
Doctor.

176
00:08:58,777 --> 00:09:00,440
The Antidean transport

177
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:02,314
wishes to leave
the station a day early.

178
00:09:02,351 --> 00:09:04,082
Their cargo is still
under quarantine.

179
00:09:04,122 --> 00:09:05,921
If you could issue
a health certificate...

180
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:06,927
Now?

181
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:08,363
It would expedite matters.

182
00:09:08,398 --> 00:09:09,697
All right. Um...

183
00:09:09,734 --> 00:09:13,037
I'll meet you in Cargo Bay 3
in ten minutes.

184
00:09:13,075 --> 00:09:14,704
Thank you, Doctor.

185
00:09:14,745 --> 00:09:16,078
Doctor.

186
00:09:17,117 --> 00:09:18,814
Well, duty calls.

187
00:09:19,823 --> 00:09:21,452
I wonder if you
could do me a favor

188
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,793
and consider
not interviewing my parents?

189
00:09:23,832 --> 00:09:25,426
Why?

190
00:09:25,469 --> 00:09:27,302
Well, to be blunt, um...

191
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,308
we're not close

192
00:09:28,342 --> 00:09:29,641
and we haven't been
for many years

193
00:09:29,678 --> 00:09:31,477
and I would consider it
a personal favor

194
00:09:31,582 --> 00:09:34,383
if you would sort of
leave my parents out of it.

195
00:09:34,421 --> 00:09:36,323
I see.

196
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,589
Well, I certainly understand.

197
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:38,892
Well, thank you.

198
00:09:38,932 --> 00:09:41,403
Um... I-I'll see you tomorrow.

199
00:09:41,437 --> 00:09:42,770
Hmm.

200
00:09:46,715 --> 00:09:52,388
Note: Contact subject's parents
immediately.

201
00:09:57,907 --> 00:10:01,074
Computer, activate
LMH Test Program 1.

202
00:10:04,454 --> 00:10:07,518
Does it meet
with your... approval?

203
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:08,688
Yeah, it looks all right.

204
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:10,792
Except for the eyes...
they seem a little dead.

205
00:10:10,835 --> 00:10:12,737
They don't have
that certain sparkle...

206
00:10:12,772 --> 00:10:14,298
the zest for life
that greets me

207
00:10:14,342 --> 00:10:15,709
in the mirror every morning.

208
00:10:16,781 --> 00:10:18,010
This is a test run.

209
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:20,579
I can assure you that
the final product will be...

210
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:21,921
"zesty."

211
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,360
- Does it talk?
- Not yet.

212
00:10:23,396 --> 00:10:24,695
First, I have to load the LMH

213
00:10:24,732 --> 00:10:26,999
with the basic database
and software configurations

214
00:10:27,038 --> 00:10:28,165
of the original program.

215
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:32,238
Computer.
Activate the EMH.

216
00:10:32,282 --> 00:10:34,378
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

217
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,980
This is a level-3 diagnostic.

218
00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:37,424
I understand.

219
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,590
Diagnostics look good.

220
00:10:39,632 --> 00:10:42,160
Beginning data transferal.

221
00:10:42,204 --> 00:10:43,867
Data transferal?

222
00:10:46,514 --> 00:10:47,949
Am I being replaced?

223
00:10:47,984 --> 00:10:51,048
You're being supplemented
by a new long-term program.

224
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,787
By him?

225
00:10:52,827 --> 00:10:54,524
There.
Transfer's complete.

226
00:10:54,565 --> 00:10:56,968
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

227
00:10:57,003 --> 00:10:58,404
Well, that's original.

228
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:01,002
He doesn't even look old
enough to be a doctor.

229
00:11:01,045 --> 00:11:02,104
If you'd like my advice

230
00:11:02,148 --> 00:11:03,617
you should delete this program.

231
00:11:03,684 --> 00:11:05,620
Now that I'm here,
why would you need

232
00:11:05,689 --> 00:11:07,716
an archaic piece
of software like him?

233
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,252
Archaic?

234
00:11:09,297 --> 00:11:11,928
We can discuss this
at another time.

235
00:11:11,969 --> 00:11:13,302
Listen...

236
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,206
He doesn't sound much like me.

237
00:11:15,243 --> 00:11:16,211
I'm sorry.

238
00:11:16,246 --> 00:11:18,011
Too zesty for you?

239
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,351
Actually, he sounds
more like you.

240
00:11:20,387 --> 00:11:23,291
As I said, I've loaded the LMH

241
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:26,267
with the basic EMH
software package.

242
00:11:26,301 --> 00:11:28,328
We'll have to build
a new set of algorithms

243
00:11:28,372 --> 00:11:31,003
based on your
scintillating personality.

244
00:11:31,044 --> 00:11:34,108
I hope you're more interesting
than you seem.

245
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,315
I'd hate to be boring.

246
00:11:36,357 --> 00:11:38,020
There may be no preventing that.

247
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,831
But we'll see
what his friends have to say.

248
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:44,600
What were your initial
impressions of Dr. Bashir?

249
00:11:44,642 --> 00:11:46,703
Good and bad.

250
00:11:46,812 --> 00:11:48,714
Young, eager, ambitious.

251
00:11:48,784 --> 00:11:50,481
He was fresh out
of medical school.

252
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:51,956
Looking forward
to his first taste

253
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,051
of "frontier medicine."

254
00:11:54,095 --> 00:11:56,623
Sometimes, he let
that natural impulse

255
00:11:56,668 --> 00:11:58,832
override his sense of decorum.

256
00:11:58,873 --> 00:12:01,208
You mean he was...
difficult.

257
00:12:01,244 --> 00:12:03,841
No, but sometimes he could...

258
00:12:03,884 --> 00:12:06,549
well, give you
way too much information.

259
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:08,218
Could you elaborate on that?

260
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,253
Sometimes, he just...

261
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:12,530
didn't know when to shut up.

262
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:14,163
Are you implying
he harassed you

263
00:12:14,206 --> 00:12:16,473
with unwanted advances?

264
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:20,680
No, but he was very persistent.

265
00:12:20,721 --> 00:12:22,190
I see.

266
00:12:22,224 --> 00:12:23,419
Could you be more specific?

267
00:12:24,528 --> 00:12:26,624
You're not being very helpful.

268
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:28,364
I do not like doctors.

269
00:12:28,404 --> 00:12:30,033
Any doctors.

270
00:12:30,074 --> 00:12:31,042
You can rest assured

271
00:12:31,076 --> 00:12:32,409
that I will keep
anything you say

272
00:12:32,446 --> 00:12:34,507
in the strictest confidence.

273
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,677
You're sure about that?

274
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,884
I wouldn't want this
to get back to Julian.

275
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,587
You have my word.

276
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:44,264
Well, the truth is,
he's... an extraordinary person.

277
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,141
A real sense of honor
and integrity...

278
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:48,478
great sense of humor...

279
00:12:48,515 --> 00:12:50,645
warm, caring...

280
00:12:51,789 --> 00:12:53,759
You're sure
he's not going to read this?

281
00:12:53,793 --> 00:12:54,761
Positive.

282
00:12:54,796 --> 00:12:56,425
So, is that all?

283
00:13:00,374 --> 00:13:02,845
Uh... there is one other thing.

284
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:07,622
Would you have dinner
with me this evening?

285
00:13:36,286 --> 00:13:38,814
Oh, well, that I'm
not going to tell you...

286
00:13:38,892 --> 00:13:40,293
Well, I think you should...

287
00:13:40,328 --> 00:13:43,129
Times like this, I think
I'm the happiest person...

288
00:13:43,168 --> 00:13:44,831
Stroll along the promenade...

289
00:13:44,872 --> 00:13:47,070
You want a real game,
try dom-jot.

290
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,670
If I ran this place

291
00:13:48,713 --> 00:13:51,652
we'd have three dom-jot tables
and two prayko alleys.

292
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:54,751
And I'd make sure the customers
had a lot more fun.

293
00:13:54,794 --> 00:13:57,163
Quark is a lot of things,
but he's not fun.

294
00:13:57,198 --> 00:13:58,325
I'm fun.

295
00:13:58,368 --> 00:13:59,701
I bet you are.

296
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:04,339
You're a fascinating woman,
Leeta.

297
00:14:04,381 --> 00:14:05,907
For a dabo girl.

298
00:14:05,952 --> 00:14:07,319
Not at all.

299
00:14:07,355 --> 00:14:10,351
You're charming
intelligent, witty...

300
00:14:10,394 --> 00:14:13,025
and extraordinarily beautiful.

301
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:14,559
Thank you.

302
00:14:15,572 --> 00:14:17,064
Excuse me!

303
00:14:18,546 --> 00:14:19,818
I need to talk to you.

304
00:14:21,989 --> 00:14:23,925
It's very important.

305
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,953
All right.

306
00:14:28,637 --> 00:14:30,106
Will you excuse me?

307
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,473
Of course.

308
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,130
What is it, Rom?

309
00:14:41,164 --> 00:14:43,157
I want to ask you if you...

310
00:14:44,171 --> 00:14:46,802
I want to...

311
00:14:46,843 --> 00:14:48,506
I... oh...

312
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:52,987
I wanted to ask if...

313
00:14:53,023 --> 00:14:55,016
tomorrow morning
would be a good time

314
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:56,793
for me to fix your replicator.

315
00:14:57,801 --> 00:14:59,030
Oh.

316
00:15:00,473 --> 00:15:01,772
Sure.

317
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,439
That would be fine.

318
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,607
Okay.

319
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:06,950
Tomorrow morning, then.

320
00:15:06,988 --> 00:15:09,653
Enjoy the rest of your evening.

321
00:15:11,631 --> 00:15:13,157
Thanks.

322
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:22,414
I'm a little concerned
about the amount of argonite

323
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,824
that's seeping into
the station's air supply.

324
00:15:24,861 --> 00:15:26,296
17 parts per million.

325
00:15:26,363 --> 00:15:28,630
That's well within
safety margins.

326
00:15:28,668 --> 00:15:31,196
Yes, but it's on the rise,
and I'd like to...

327
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:34,040
I'm sorry to interrupt, sir

328
00:15:34,081 --> 00:15:36,108
but there are a couple of
visitors here looking for Julian

329
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:39,125
and I thought he might
want to see them right away.

330
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:41,392
Well, send them in.

331
00:15:48,412 --> 00:15:50,041
Oh...

332
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,484
my God.

333
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:53,044
Hello, Jules.

334
00:16:02,777 --> 00:16:05,305
Uh, Captain...

335
00:16:05,349 --> 00:16:09,484
allow me to introduce
Amsha and...

336
00:16:09,525 --> 00:16:12,326
Richard Bashir, my parents.

337
00:16:19,547 --> 00:16:21,574
I'm Captain Benjamin Sisko.

338
00:16:21,619 --> 00:16:23,680
Welcome to Deep Space 9.

339
00:16:23,723 --> 00:16:24,952
Thank you, Captain.

340
00:16:24,993 --> 00:16:27,692
It's a pleasure to finally see
where Jules works.

341
00:16:27,732 --> 00:16:29,065
We wanted to come before

342
00:16:29,101 --> 00:16:31,538
but my schedule's
been so busy up until now.

343
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,372
I'm sure you know
what it's like.

344
00:16:33,444 --> 00:16:35,175
All too well, I'm afraid.

345
00:16:35,215 --> 00:16:37,743
What is it you do, Mr. Bashir?

346
00:16:37,787 --> 00:16:40,350
Oh... I've done many things.

347
00:16:40,393 --> 00:16:42,864
At the moment, I'm involved
in landscape architecture

348
00:16:42,898 --> 00:16:44,697
designing public spaces,
parks mostly.

349
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:47,229
I love the idea
of working on projects

350
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:49,244
that thousands of people
will enjoy

351
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,406
long after I'm gone.

352
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:51,814
They're my... my legacy

353
00:16:51,851 --> 00:16:53,718
my gift to succeeding
generations.

354
00:16:53,755 --> 00:16:56,522
Aside from Jules here,
of course.

355
00:16:56,561 --> 00:16:58,360
You must be
very proud of your son.

356
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,663
Oh, yes.

357
00:16:59,702 --> 00:17:02,572
He's a very...
gifted young man.

358
00:17:02,609 --> 00:17:04,306
I hope you're putting
all his talents

359
00:17:04,346 --> 00:17:05,336
to good use, Captain.

360
00:17:05,381 --> 00:17:06,371
We try.

361
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,577
Well, sometimes

362
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,055
you have to push him a little.

363
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:10,057
It took quite a while

364
00:17:10,092 --> 00:17:11,618
to talk him
into taking up medicine.

365
00:17:11,662 --> 00:17:12,630
But he did.

366
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:13,654
So you're the reason

367
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,032
he went to medical school.

368
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,037
That's right.

369
00:17:16,071 --> 00:17:17,300
He wanted to become...

370
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,313
Perhaps we should save that
until another time, Richard.

371
00:17:20,347 --> 00:17:22,875
I'm sure the Captain
is a very busy man.

372
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:23,887
Oh...

373
00:17:23,921 --> 00:17:24,946
of course.

374
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,926
Maybe after our interviews
are over.

375
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,397
Interviews?

376
00:17:28,432 --> 00:17:30,699
Yes, with a Dr. Um... Zimmerman.

377
00:17:30,736 --> 00:17:31,863
Didn't he tell you?

378
00:17:31,906 --> 00:17:33,899
No, he didn't.

379
00:17:33,943 --> 00:17:35,310
He said it was urgent.

380
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:36,907
That the two of you
were working together

381
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,145
on a very important project

382
00:17:38,186 --> 00:17:40,657
and that we had
to come here right away.

383
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,025
Yes.
Well, why don't I see

384
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,829
if I can find you some
accommodations for this evening.

385
00:17:44,867 --> 00:17:45,892
Yeah.

386
00:17:45,937 --> 00:17:47,736
It was a pleasure
to meet you both.

387
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:49,870
I hope we get a chance
to see you again.

388
00:17:49,912 --> 00:17:51,643
I can't wait
to hear some stories

389
00:17:51,682 --> 00:17:53,117
about Julian as a little boy.

390
00:17:53,152 --> 00:17:54,621
Oh, lord, there are so many.

391
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,786
You know, from the time
he was this high

392
00:17:56,828 --> 00:17:58,855
we knew he was destined
for greatness.

393
00:17:58,898 --> 00:18:02,338
The Captain, Father,
is a very busy man.

394
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:03,568
We'll talk later.

395
00:18:19,778 --> 00:18:22,808
Oh, we're just
working out a few bugs.

396
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,320
Chief, if you'll excuse us

397
00:18:24,355 --> 00:18:26,986
I'd like a moment or two
alone with Dr. Zimmerman.

398
00:18:27,027 --> 00:18:28,360
Of course.

399
00:18:28,396 --> 00:18:30,059
You brought my parents
to this station

400
00:18:30,101 --> 00:18:31,262
against my explicit wishes

401
00:18:31,303 --> 00:18:33,034
that you keep them
out of this project.

402
00:18:33,073 --> 00:18:35,510
I'm sorry it upsets you,
but their input is...

403
00:18:35,612 --> 00:18:37,479
You had no right
to bring them here.

404
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:38,643
I did not bring them here.

405
00:18:38,686 --> 00:18:40,451
I simply issued an invitation.

406
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,050
You said it was urgent.

407
00:18:42,093 --> 00:18:43,254
It is urgent... to me.

408
00:18:43,296 --> 00:18:44,457
Like it or not

409
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,800
they're an important
part of your background

410
00:18:46,838 --> 00:18:48,330
and I need to interview them.

411
00:18:48,373 --> 00:18:49,672
Now, if you'll excuse me

412
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,339
I have a delivery to make.

413
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,843
Have I caught you at a bad time?

414
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,453
It's never a bad time
for flowers.

415
00:19:13,496 --> 00:19:14,725
Come on in.

416
00:19:14,765 --> 00:19:17,464
Could you find a place
for those while I change?

417
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:18,996
Of course.

418
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,812
By the way, if you're
trying to impress me...

419
00:19:24,854 --> 00:19:26,847
you've succeeded.

420
00:19:28,729 --> 00:19:30,893
I spoke to some of my colleagues

421
00:19:30,934 --> 00:19:33,337
at the Jupiter Station
this morning.

422
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:37,039
It seems that the manager
of our station café

423
00:19:37,081 --> 00:19:38,983
has decided to quit.

424
00:19:39,018 --> 00:19:40,111
Really?

425
00:19:40,154 --> 00:19:42,819
They're still looking
for a new manager.

426
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,489
Someone with experience

427
00:19:44,531 --> 00:19:47,732
in both food service
and entertainment.

428
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:49,604
Someone like you.

429
00:19:49,642 --> 00:19:51,441
Me?

430
00:19:52,716 --> 00:19:54,618
Y-yes. I've already
taken the liberty

431
00:19:54,686 --> 00:19:57,625
of speaking to our station's
commanding officer about you

432
00:19:57,659 --> 00:19:58,958
and she's amenable to the idea.

433
00:19:58,996 --> 00:20:01,365
The café is yours
if you want it.

434
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:04,340
My own café?

435
00:20:07,214 --> 00:20:09,047
Oh.

436
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:10,143
Sorry.

437
00:20:10,186 --> 00:20:11,746
Not at all.

438
00:20:13,762 --> 00:20:14,889
It's not very big.

439
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,991
Less than half the size
of Quark's.

440
00:20:17,036 --> 00:20:18,335
Really?

441
00:20:18,371 --> 00:20:20,842
But there's room enough
for a couple of dom-jot tables.

442
00:20:20,877 --> 00:20:22,870
But I've never run a restaurant

443
00:20:22,915 --> 00:20:24,042
or any kind of business.

444
00:20:24,084 --> 00:20:26,783
I barely even know
how to tend bar.

445
00:20:26,823 --> 00:20:29,887
That puts you one step ahead
of our last bartender.

446
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,832
But where would I stay?

447
00:20:31,867 --> 00:20:34,361
I don't even know anybody there.

448
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:35,706
You know me...

449
00:20:35,743 --> 00:20:38,807
and I was hoping you would
consider staying with me.

450
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,683
But Louis...

451
00:20:40,721 --> 00:20:42,122
I just met you.

452
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,150
I mean, I like you...

453
00:20:44,195 --> 00:20:46,723
You see? You're warming up
to me already.

454
00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:49,102
Given time,
you might begin to feel more.

455
00:20:50,776 --> 00:20:52,211
Just as I do.

456
00:20:53,181 --> 00:20:55,550
Besides, you said
you liked cerebral men

457
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,318
and, at the risk
of sounding immodest

458
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:58,758
I have a towering intellect.

459
00:21:01,533 --> 00:21:04,700
Come with me, Leeta.
Please.

460
00:21:04,807 --> 00:21:06,868
I promise you won't regret it.

461
00:21:06,911 --> 00:21:08,904
I know I won't.

462
00:21:12,157 --> 00:21:14,321
I need to think about that.

463
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,966
Take all the time you need.

464
00:21:37,011 --> 00:21:40,678
Captain Sisko seems
like a very nice man, Jules.

465
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:42,621
Not like the Captain
of the transport

466
00:21:42,656 --> 00:21:43,989
that brought us here.

467
00:21:44,026 --> 00:21:46,759
I've never met a ruder,
more abrasive man in my life.

468
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,769
I tell you, when I
used to run shuttles

469
00:21:48,804 --> 00:21:51,298
I never would've tolerated
that kind of behavior

470
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:52,607
towards my passengers.

471
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,615
Dad, you're talking
to me now.

472
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:58,351
You were a third-class steward
for all of six months.

473
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:02,431
That's right...
and I was required

474
00:22:02,467 --> 00:22:04,130
to have daily contact
with the passengers.

475
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,437
And you can bet that if I even
looked at them the wrong way

476
00:22:06,476 --> 00:22:07,877
I would've been discharged
on the spot.

477
00:22:07,913 --> 00:22:09,746
I thought you were.

478
00:22:09,783 --> 00:22:11,116
No.

479
00:22:11,152 --> 00:22:12,621
I resigned.

480
00:22:14,794 --> 00:22:16,924
Are you still doing research,
Jules?

481
00:22:16,965 --> 00:22:18,058
Yes.

482
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:20,299
Right now, I'm working
on two studies

483
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,249
of prion replication
in ganglionic cell clusters.

484
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,080
You could've done research
back on Earth.

485
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,589
I told you that five years ago.

486
00:22:26,624 --> 00:22:29,255
But you insisted
on taking this position

487
00:22:29,296 --> 00:22:32,792
because you wanted to work in,
um... frontier medicine.

488
00:22:32,837 --> 00:22:35,969
On DS9, I can do both.

489
00:22:37,548 --> 00:22:41,512
So, you're doing
"landscape architecture" now.

490
00:22:41,557 --> 00:22:43,026
It's all he can talk about.

491
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,793
You should see the stacks
of drawings in our house.

492
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:47,860
It's like living
in a drafting studio.

493
00:22:47,904 --> 00:22:49,305
Some, uh, very important people

494
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,641
have expressed interest
in my park designs.

495
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,344
I have some very good prospects
on the horizon.

496
00:22:54,385 --> 00:22:56,652
Oh, you always have
very good prospects

497
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:59,287
and they were always
just over that horizon.

498
00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:02,562
Um... maybe you should tell us

499
00:23:02,603 --> 00:23:05,336
about the interviews
we're doing tomorrow, Jules.

500
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:07,277
What kind of questions
will they ask?

501
00:23:07,313 --> 00:23:09,306
Well, Dr. Zimmerman,
as I understand it

502
00:23:09,351 --> 00:23:12,483
is trying to compile a complete
psychological profile of me.

503
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:15,190
He's going to be asking you
all sorts of questions.

504
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,927
Try to keep your answers
as brief

505
00:23:16,967 --> 00:23:19,666
and to the point as you can.

506
00:23:19,707 --> 00:23:21,871
You don't want to give him
any openings

507
00:23:21,912 --> 00:23:23,005
to probe into any...

508
00:23:23,048 --> 00:23:24,608
awkward areas.

509
00:23:24,652 --> 00:23:26,885
I'm sure we can handle it.

510
00:23:26,923 --> 00:23:28,483
Try not to take this
too lightly.

511
00:23:28,526 --> 00:23:30,861
He's going to be asking detailed
questions about my childhood

512
00:23:30,898 --> 00:23:31,923
and if you're not careful...

513
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:33,026
You don't trust us?

514
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,471
He didn't say that, Richard.

515
00:23:34,506 --> 00:23:36,442
No, but that's what he meant,
isn't it?

516
00:23:36,478 --> 00:23:37,742
You think we're going to slip up

517
00:23:37,847 --> 00:23:39,646
say the wrong thing,
get us all in trouble?

518
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:41,450
Look, I've got
a lot at stake here.

519
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:43,220
My whole career
could be destroyed

520
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:45,753
if Dr. Zimmerman gets wind
of our little secret.

521
00:23:45,798 --> 00:23:47,324
You've got a lot at stake?

522
00:23:47,368 --> 00:23:48,495
Well, what about us?

523
00:23:48,537 --> 00:23:50,336
We could go to prison, Jules.

524
00:23:50,374 --> 00:23:51,775
Have you ever thought
about that?

525
00:23:51,811 --> 00:23:53,542
Of course I've thought
about that!

526
00:23:53,581 --> 00:23:56,018
That's why I want you
to take this seriously!

527
00:23:56,053 --> 00:23:57,716
Ah, so now we're not
taking it seriously.

528
00:23:57,757 --> 00:23:59,124
We're not as bright as he is.

529
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,993
We don't have
your gifted intellect

530
00:24:01,031 --> 00:24:03,001
so we can't see
the perfectly obvious.

531
00:24:03,036 --> 00:24:05,564
This is exactly why I haven't
been home in three years.

532
00:24:05,608 --> 00:24:07,578
- Jules, please...
- No, let him go.

533
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,514
He can barely stand to be

534
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,985
in the same room with us!

535
00:24:22,478 --> 00:24:25,041
I haven't made up my mind, yet.

536
00:24:25,084 --> 00:24:27,054
I mean, this could be
a big opportunity

537
00:24:27,088 --> 00:24:29,321
but that's no reason
to rush into anything.

538
00:24:31,498 --> 00:24:33,799
What do you think I should do?

539
00:24:33,904 --> 00:24:34,894
I...

540
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:37,343
I...

541
00:24:37,378 --> 00:24:38,938
I don't know.

542
00:24:40,517 --> 00:24:44,686
If I had a reason to stay,
I'd stay.

543
00:24:47,467 --> 00:24:50,303
Do I have a reason to stay?

544
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:51,774
I...

545
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:55,049
I don't know.

546
00:24:57,956 --> 00:24:59,185
Well, I...

547
00:24:59,226 --> 00:25:01,459
guess I better take the job.

548
00:25:01,498 --> 00:25:03,434
Great.

549
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:04,801
Is that all you can say?

550
00:25:04,905 --> 00:25:06,932
I... I...

551
00:25:06,976 --> 00:25:08,001
l...

552
00:25:08,045 --> 00:25:09,172
You don't know.

553
00:25:10,851 --> 00:25:12,821
Thanks, Rom.

554
00:25:12,889 --> 00:25:15,087
You've been a big help.

555
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,030
You're welcome.

556
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:31,522
Is there something
I can do for you?

557
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:34,195
Your father has something
he wants to say.

558
00:25:34,236 --> 00:25:36,103
Richard?

559
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,606
It's a... stressful time
for all of us

560
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:44,648
and maybe I said some things
I... shouldn't have.

561
00:25:44,692 --> 00:25:46,890
What he's trying to say is

562
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:49,800
we would never do anything
to jeopardize your career.

563
00:25:49,837 --> 00:25:51,898
And just so there's
no misunderstanding

564
00:25:51,975 --> 00:25:53,877
I give you my word
that, at no time

565
00:25:53,912 --> 00:25:55,905
in our interview
with Dr. Zimmerman

566
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,353
will we ever mention,
or even hint at the fact

567
00:25:58,389 --> 00:26:00,917
that you were genetically
enhanced as a child.

568
00:26:00,961 --> 00:26:02,225
Jules, you can trust us.

569
00:26:02,264 --> 00:26:03,357
Your father and I

570
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,530
kept the secret
of your DNA resequencing

571
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:07,200
for almost 25 years

572
00:26:07,241 --> 00:26:08,710
and we're not going
to let it out now.

573
00:26:08,745 --> 00:26:11,376
But I would just add

574
00:26:11,417 --> 00:26:12,852
that, despite
what the authorities

575
00:26:12,887 --> 00:26:14,151
would like us to believe

576
00:26:14,191 --> 00:26:16,754
genetic engineering is nothing
to be ashamed of.

577
00:26:16,796 --> 00:26:19,233
You're not any less human
than anyone else.

578
00:26:19,268 --> 00:26:21,033
In fact, you're a little more.

579
00:26:21,072 --> 00:26:23,635
We didn't come here
to start another fight.

580
00:26:23,678 --> 00:26:25,774
Let's just try
to get through this.

581
00:26:25,816 --> 00:26:27,308
All right?

582
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:31,252
All right.

583
00:26:57,886 --> 00:27:00,050
Who are those people?

584
00:27:14,323 --> 00:27:16,122
I can't believe
you set them up like that!

585
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,424
We didn't set them up.

586
00:27:17,463 --> 00:27:20,595
They just happened to walk in
while the program was running.

587
00:27:20,636 --> 00:27:22,834
Zimmerman thought it
would be a good idea

588
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:24,434
to test the program's ability

589
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:26,471
to cope
with an unexpected situation.

590
00:27:26,515 --> 00:27:27,574
And you let them go on?

591
00:27:27,618 --> 00:27:30,146
You let them stand there
and make fools of themselves

592
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:32,127
while the two of you
sat in the back room

593
00:27:32,161 --> 00:27:33,151
and laughed?!

594
00:27:33,197 --> 00:27:34,928
Look, I'm sorry about this.

595
00:27:34,968 --> 00:27:36,938
I wish it had never happened.

596
00:27:36,972 --> 00:27:38,999
But it has, and now
we've got a problem.

597
00:27:39,111 --> 00:27:41,639
I don't want to talk about it.

598
00:27:41,683 --> 00:27:43,653
Julian, Zimmerman
is going to file a report

599
00:27:43,687 --> 00:27:45,520
saying that Dr. Bashir

600
00:27:45,557 --> 00:27:47,288
is unsuitable
for computer modeling

601
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:51,861
because of his suspected
genetically enhanced background.

602
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:54,775
Do you know what's going
to happen when that report

603
00:27:54,811 --> 00:27:56,678
gets back to Starfleet Medical?

604
00:27:58,286 --> 00:28:00,347
There's going to be
a formal investigation.

605
00:28:03,196 --> 00:28:06,169
Which will lead
to my eventual dismissal

606
00:28:06,203 --> 00:28:08,800
from the service.

607
00:28:08,842 --> 00:28:10,175
Then it's true?

608
00:28:11,715 --> 00:28:12,808
You're...

609
00:28:12,851 --> 00:28:15,915
The word you're looking for

610
00:28:15,958 --> 00:28:18,019
is "unnatural"

611
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:21,399
meaning "not from nature."

612
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,022
"Freak"

613
00:28:27,057 --> 00:28:28,686
or "monster"

614
00:28:28,728 --> 00:28:31,256
would also be acceptable.

615
00:28:35,944 --> 00:28:38,279
I was six.

616
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:41,152
Small for my age, a bit
awkward, physically

617
00:28:41,188 --> 00:28:42,748
not very bright.

618
00:28:42,792 --> 00:28:44,091
In the first grade

619
00:28:44,128 --> 00:28:45,427
when the other children
were learning

620
00:28:45,498 --> 00:28:47,662
how to read and write
and use the computer

621
00:28:47,703 --> 00:28:52,111
I was still trying
to tell a dog from a cat

622
00:28:52,146 --> 00:28:54,310
and a tree from a house.

623
00:28:54,351 --> 00:28:57,620
I didn't really understand
what was happening.

624
00:28:57,658 --> 00:29:01,325
I knew that I wasn't doing
as well as my classmates.

625
00:29:02,903 --> 00:29:05,534
There were so many concepts
that they took for granted

626
00:29:05,575 --> 00:29:08,912
that... I couldn't
begin to master

627
00:29:08,949 --> 00:29:11,614
and I didn't know why.

628
00:29:11,655 --> 00:29:15,756
All I knew... was that I

629
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:18,291
was a great disappointment
to my parents.

630
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,909
I don't remember
when they made the decision

631
00:29:23,949 --> 00:29:28,585
but just before
my seventh birthday...

632
00:29:30,697 --> 00:29:33,932
we left Earth for Adigeon Prime.

633
00:29:33,971 --> 00:29:37,810
At first, I remember
being really excited

634
00:29:37,846 --> 00:29:40,079
at seeing all the aliens
in the hospital

635
00:29:40,118 --> 00:29:45,027
and then they gave me a room
and... began the treatments

636
00:29:45,062 --> 00:29:48,969
and my entire world
began to change.

637
00:29:50,307 --> 00:29:52,505
What were the treatments?

638
00:29:52,579 --> 00:29:55,346
Some kind of DNA recoding?

639
00:29:56,687 --> 00:29:58,122
The technical term

640
00:29:58,157 --> 00:30:02,428
is "accelerated critical
neural pathway formation."

641
00:30:02,466 --> 00:30:04,527
Over the course
of the next two months

642
00:30:04,572 --> 00:30:06,542
my genetic structure
was manipulated

643
00:30:06,576 --> 00:30:08,546
to accelerate the growth
of neuronal networks

644
00:30:08,581 --> 00:30:10,483
in my cerebral cortex

645
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:15,051
and a whole new Julian Bashir
was born.

646
00:30:15,095 --> 00:30:18,557
In what way did they...

647
00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:20,366
change you?

648
00:30:20,406 --> 00:30:23,436
Well, my mental abilities
were top priority, of course.

649
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,851
My IQ jumped five points a day
for over two weeks.

650
00:30:26,888 --> 00:30:30,055
Followed by improvements
in my hand/eye coordination

651
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:34,126
stamina, vision, reflexes,
weight, height.

652
00:30:34,169 --> 00:30:36,402
In the end,
everything but my name

653
00:30:36,441 --> 00:30:38,104
was altered in some way.

654
00:30:38,145 --> 00:30:39,409
When we returned to Earth

655
00:30:39,448 --> 00:30:41,247
we even moved
to a different city.

656
00:30:41,286 --> 00:30:44,851
I was enrolled in a new school
using falsified records

657
00:30:44,893 --> 00:30:47,023
my parents obtained somewhere.

658
00:30:47,065 --> 00:30:50,163
Instead of being
the slowest learner

659
00:30:50,205 --> 00:30:52,403
I was the star pupil.

660
00:30:52,443 --> 00:30:54,641
And no one ever suspected?

661
00:30:54,748 --> 00:30:57,652
Oh, there's no stigma
attached to success, Chief.

662
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,525
After the treatments,
I never looked back

663
00:31:00,561 --> 00:31:04,126
but the truth is, I'm a fraud.

664
00:31:04,169 --> 00:31:05,866
You're not a fraud.

665
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:08,002
I don't care
how many enhancements

666
00:31:08,044 --> 00:31:09,445
your parents had done.

667
00:31:09,481 --> 00:31:11,952
Genetic recoding
can't give you ambition

668
00:31:11,987 --> 00:31:14,048
or a personality or compassion

669
00:31:14,091 --> 00:31:17,964
or any of the things
that make a person truly human.

670
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,437
Well, Starfleet Medical
won't see it that way.

671
00:31:20,472 --> 00:31:22,101
DNA resequencing for any reason

672
00:31:22,142 --> 00:31:24,978
other than repairing serious
birth defects is illegal.

673
00:31:25,015 --> 00:31:26,814
Any genetically enhanced
human being

674
00:31:26,853 --> 00:31:28,652
is barred from serving
in Starfleet

675
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,923
or practicing medicine.

676
00:31:30,961 --> 00:31:33,455
I don't think
there's been a case

677
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,630
dealing with any of this
in a hundred years.

678
00:31:35,671 --> 00:31:38,302
You can't be sure
how they'll react.

679
00:31:38,344 --> 00:31:40,246
Oh, I am sure.

680
00:31:40,282 --> 00:31:41,911
Once the truth comes out

681
00:31:41,952 --> 00:31:45,119
I'll be cashiered
from the service.

682
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:46,184
It's that simple.

683
00:31:46,228 --> 00:31:47,663
There must be
something we can do.

684
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:48,687
We can't just give up.

685
00:31:50,471 --> 00:31:52,669
There is something I can do.

686
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:54,041
Resign

687
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,571
before Dr. Zimmerman
files his report.

688
00:31:55,615 --> 00:31:57,517
Oh, Julian...

689
00:31:57,553 --> 00:31:58,578
It's over, Miles.

690
00:31:58,622 --> 00:32:00,615
I always knew this could happen.

691
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,220
Now it has.

692
00:32:02,263 --> 00:32:05,327
Now, if you'll excuse me

693
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:07,340
I'd like to be alone.

694
00:32:25,948 --> 00:32:28,112
I should have told her
how I felt.

695
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,056
Thank the Nagus
that you didn't.

696
00:32:30,091 --> 00:32:31,617
Remember what happened
with Nog's mother?

697
00:32:34,133 --> 00:32:35,659
Yeah...

698
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:38,266
don't want to think
about her, do you?

699
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:41,339
Let me refresh your memory.

700
00:32:41,383 --> 00:32:43,980
You signed a standard
five-year marriage contract

701
00:32:44,022 --> 00:32:45,012
with Prinadora's father

702
00:32:45,057 --> 00:32:46,617
because you wanted
to have a child...

703
00:32:46,661 --> 00:32:48,757
a simple everyday business deal.

704
00:32:48,832 --> 00:32:52,363
But then, you fell in love
with your wife

705
00:32:52,407 --> 00:32:54,742
and wanted to extend
the contract.

706
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:56,146
And you were so in love

707
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,278
that you never bothered
to read the extension

708
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,721
before signing it.

709
00:32:59,756 --> 00:33:01,191
So, in the end

710
00:33:01,227 --> 00:33:04,131
her father swindled you
out of all of your money.

711
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:08,232
Prinadora left you
for a richer man.

712
00:33:08,275 --> 00:33:10,712
And you got stuck with Nog.

713
00:33:10,747 --> 00:33:12,843
Hooray for romance.

714
00:33:12,885 --> 00:33:15,721
Leeta is not Prinadora.

715
00:33:15,758 --> 00:33:17,956
She's a female, Rom

716
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:19,660
and the one constant
in the universe is

717
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,067
females are trouble.

718
00:33:24,477 --> 00:33:27,575
Look, if you're lonely...

719
00:33:27,617 --> 00:33:30,988
I've got
a new holosuite program.

720
00:33:32,495 --> 00:33:36,162
"Vulcan Love Slave, Part II:
The Revenge."

721
00:33:37,706 --> 00:33:39,403
Give it a try.

722
00:33:39,443 --> 00:33:41,242
After a couple hours...

723
00:33:41,281 --> 00:33:43,183
you'll forget all about Leeta.

724
00:33:55,111 --> 00:33:57,241
We're not going to just
take this lying down

725
00:33:57,283 --> 00:33:58,444
that's for sure.

726
00:33:58,485 --> 00:34:00,421
I'll arrange for legal counsel.

727
00:34:00,457 --> 00:34:02,290
We're going to fight this
all the way

728
00:34:02,327 --> 00:34:03,626
to the Federation Supreme Court.

729
00:34:03,663 --> 00:34:04,790
We can't fight this.

730
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:06,462
You better change that attitude
right now

731
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:08,667
if you want to hang on
to your career.

732
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:09,972
Jules, listen to your father.

733
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,069
He's trying to help you.

734
00:34:11,113 --> 00:34:12,810
Neither of you
is listening to me.

735
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:15,013
I don't want to drag this
through the courts.

736
00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:18,085
We're a little beyond worrying
about your wants, Jules.

737
00:34:18,129 --> 00:34:21,466
We have a serious problem here
and we have to stop the whining

738
00:34:21,503 --> 00:34:23,974
and concentrate
on coming up with a new plan.

739
00:34:24,008 --> 00:34:25,807
A new plan.

740
00:34:25,845 --> 00:34:27,144
Yes!

741
00:34:27,182 --> 00:34:29,175
Let's come up with a new plan!

742
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,779
That's the way we do things
in this family, isn't it?

743
00:34:30,823 --> 00:34:32,315
We don't face our problems.

744
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,829
We come up with new plans.

745
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:34,831
Don't like your job?

746
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:36,026
Well, move along
to the next one.

747
00:34:36,067 --> 00:34:37,035
Don't like the law?

748
00:34:37,069 --> 00:34:38,196
Well, find a way
to get around it.

749
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,229
But whatever you do

750
00:34:39,275 --> 00:34:42,840
do not accept responsibility.

751
00:34:42,882 --> 00:34:44,784
All those gifts...

752
00:34:44,821 --> 00:34:47,088
all those accomplishments...

753
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,791
and you still want to behave
like a spoiled child.

754
00:34:49,832 --> 00:34:51,734
Well, you better grow up
right now

755
00:34:51,769 --> 00:34:53,762
or you're going
to lose everything.

756
00:34:53,807 --> 00:34:55,606
You mean, you're going
to lose everything.

757
00:34:55,644 --> 00:34:57,877
You're going to lose
your only

758
00:34:57,915 --> 00:35:00,216
real accomplishment
in this life...

759
00:35:00,254 --> 00:35:01,587
me.

760
00:35:01,624 --> 00:35:03,857
You said before, I'm your legacy

761
00:35:03,896 --> 00:35:05,957
your proud gift to the world.

762
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,135
Well, Father, your gift
is about to be revealed...

763
00:35:10,176 --> 00:35:11,975
as a fraud.

764
00:35:12,013 --> 00:35:13,642
Just like you.

765
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,116
I'm still your father, Jules

766
00:35:17,158 --> 00:35:20,131
and I will not have you
talk to me like that.

767
00:35:20,164 --> 00:35:21,325
No.

768
00:35:21,368 --> 00:35:24,569
You used to be my father.

769
00:35:24,607 --> 00:35:27,842
Now... you're my architect.

770
00:35:27,881 --> 00:35:30,854
The man who designed
a better son

771
00:35:30,888 --> 00:35:35,763
to replace the defective one
he was given.

772
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:39,239
Well, your design...
has a built-in flaw.

773
00:35:39,273 --> 00:35:41,140
It's illegal.

774
00:35:41,177 --> 00:35:42,476
You're so smart.

775
00:35:42,514 --> 00:35:45,281
You know so much you can
sit there and judge us

776
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,621
but you're still
not smart enough to see

777
00:35:47,658 --> 00:35:50,688
that we saved you from a life
of remedial education

778
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:51,961
and underachievement!

779
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:53,469
You don't know that.

780
00:35:53,504 --> 00:35:55,497
You didn't give me a chance.

781
00:35:55,543 --> 00:35:57,240
You were falling behind.

782
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,715
I was six years old.

783
00:35:58,749 --> 00:36:02,018
You decided I was a failure
in the first grade.

784
00:36:02,056 --> 00:36:03,525
You don't understand, Jules.

785
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,824
You never did.

786
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:06,162
No, you don't understand!

787
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:07,930
I stopped calling myself
Jules when I was 15

788
00:36:08,037 --> 00:36:09,666
and I'd found out
what you'd done to me.

789
00:36:09,707 --> 00:36:10,675
I'm Julian!

790
00:36:10,709 --> 00:36:12,269
What difference
does that make?!

791
00:36:12,313 --> 00:36:13,714
It makes every difference!

792
00:36:13,749 --> 00:36:14,944
Because I'm different!

793
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:16,318
Can't you see?!

794
00:36:16,354 --> 00:36:17,948
Jules Bashir died
in that hospital

795
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:20,052
because you couldn't
live with the shame

796
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,484
of having a son
who didn't measure up!

797
00:36:21,617 --> 00:36:22,778
That's not true.

798
00:36:22,819 --> 00:36:24,789
We were never ashamed of you...
never.

799
00:36:24,824 --> 00:36:26,191
I'm sorry, Mother,
but the truth is...

800
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:27,195
You don't know.

801
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,097
You've never had a child.

802
00:36:29,134 --> 00:36:31,605
You don't know what it's like
to watch your son...

803
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:35,978
to watch him fall a little
further behind every day.

804
00:36:36,015 --> 00:36:37,040
You know he's trying

805
00:36:37,084 --> 00:36:39,419
but something's
holding him back.

806
00:36:39,523 --> 00:36:42,359
You don't know what it's like
to stay up every night

807
00:36:42,396 --> 00:36:45,027
worrying that maybe
it's your fault.

808
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:47,939
Maybe you did something wrong
during the pregnancy

809
00:36:47,975 --> 00:36:50,776
or maybe you weren't
careful enough

810
00:36:50,815 --> 00:36:52,808
or maybe there's something wrong
with you.

811
00:36:52,852 --> 00:36:54,047
Maybe you passed on

812
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:56,253
a genetic defect
without even knowing it.

813
00:36:56,293 --> 00:36:57,592
Amsha...

814
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,190
No, this is important.

815
00:36:59,233 --> 00:37:01,704
You can condemn us
for what we did.

816
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:03,140
You can say
it's illegal or immoral

817
00:37:03,175 --> 00:37:04,404
or whatever you want to say...

818
00:37:04,444 --> 00:37:06,915
but you have to understand

819
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:10,355
that we didn't do it
because we were ashamed...

820
00:37:10,391 --> 00:37:13,090
but because you were our son

821
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:14,691
and we loved you.

822
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,597
What do you want us to do?

823
00:37:32,873 --> 00:37:34,433
Nothing.

824
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:41,588
I'm going to visit Captain Sisko
in the morning

825
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,859
and explain the situation to him

826
00:37:43,897 --> 00:37:46,391
and tender
my Starfleet resignation.

827
00:37:46,436 --> 00:37:49,203
Are you certain
this is what you want?

828
00:37:49,243 --> 00:37:50,576
Yes.

829
00:37:54,154 --> 00:37:57,925
I just... want to leave
the station quietly.

830
00:38:19,376 --> 00:38:20,675
Come in, Doctor.

831
00:38:20,712 --> 00:38:22,511
We were just talking about you.

832
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:25,282
Admiral, allow me to introduce
Dr. Julian Bashir.

833
00:38:25,322 --> 00:38:26,621
Doctor, this is

834
00:38:26,659 --> 00:38:29,153
Rear Admiral Bennett,
Judge Advocate General.

835
00:38:29,198 --> 00:38:30,325
Admiral.

836
00:38:30,366 --> 00:38:31,527
Doctor.

837
00:38:31,636 --> 00:38:33,538
May I ask what's going on?

838
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,111
Your parents came
to see me this morning.

839
00:38:36,146 --> 00:38:39,278
They explained the situation
about your genetic background.

840
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,791
I contacted Admiral Bennett
a short time ago.

841
00:38:41,825 --> 00:38:43,192
We've just reached an agreement

842
00:38:43,229 --> 00:38:44,562
which will allow you
to retain

843
00:38:44,664 --> 00:38:46,760
both your commission
and your medical practice.

844
00:38:46,803 --> 00:38:49,776
I'm going to prison.

845
00:38:49,809 --> 00:38:51,176
What?!

846
00:38:51,212 --> 00:38:52,373
Two years.

847
00:38:52,415 --> 00:38:54,852
It's a minimum security penal
colony in New Zealand.

848
00:38:54,888 --> 00:38:56,289
You can't do this.

849
00:38:56,323 --> 00:38:58,590
It was your father's
suggestion, Doctor.

850
00:38:58,695 --> 00:39:01,223
He pleads guilty
to illegal genetic engineering

851
00:39:01,268 --> 00:39:03,329
and in exchange,
you stay in the service.

852
00:39:03,373 --> 00:39:04,363
Well, I want no part of it.

853
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:06,071
I'm not going to stand
here while my father...

854
00:39:06,112 --> 00:39:07,479
Jules...

855
00:39:07,515 --> 00:39:09,542
Julian.

856
00:39:09,619 --> 00:39:10,552
Listen to me.

857
00:39:10,621 --> 00:39:11,920
This is my decision.

858
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:14,555
I'm the one who took you
to Adigeon Prime.

859
00:39:15,867 --> 00:39:19,933
I'm the one who should, uh...
take responsibility for it.

860
00:39:22,113 --> 00:39:24,277
Let him do this, Julian.

861
00:39:25,922 --> 00:39:27,357
Two years?

862
00:39:27,391 --> 00:39:29,487
Isn't that a bit harsh?

863
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,759
I don't think so.

864
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,601
200 years ago,
we tried to improve the species

865
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:35,803
through DNA resequencing.

866
00:39:35,844 --> 00:39:38,372
And what did we get
for our trouble?

867
00:39:38,416 --> 00:39:40,614
The Eugenics Wars.

868
00:39:40,654 --> 00:39:43,387
For every Julian Bashir
that can be created

869
00:39:43,427 --> 00:39:45,625
there's a Khan Singh
waiting in the wings...

870
00:39:45,698 --> 00:39:47,133
a superhuman...

871
00:39:47,168 --> 00:39:48,728
whose ambition
and thirst for power

872
00:39:48,772 --> 00:39:52,041
have been enhanced
along with his intellect.

873
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,209
The law
against genetic engineering

874
00:39:54,251 --> 00:39:56,449
provides a firewall
against such men

875
00:39:56,489 --> 00:40:00,054
and it's my job
to keep that firewall intact.

876
00:40:02,435 --> 00:40:04,405
I've made my offer.

877
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,000
Do you accept?

878
00:40:08,849 --> 00:40:10,318
Yes.

879
00:40:10,353 --> 00:40:12,346
Then report to my office
at Starfleet Headquarters

880
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,449
once you arrive on Earth.

881
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,374
Take your time.

882
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,551
Good-bye, Julian.

883
00:40:44,595 --> 00:40:45,928
Good-bye, Mother.

884
00:40:47,501 --> 00:40:51,134
Well... I guess I'll see you
in a couple of years.

885
00:40:51,176 --> 00:40:53,146
Oh, I'm sure they have, uh...

886
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,740
visiting hours at your facility.

887
00:40:54,783 --> 00:40:56,082
Maybe I could...

888
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,919
That would be most welcome.

889
00:41:05,541 --> 00:41:07,443
Father...

890
00:41:08,447 --> 00:41:10,508
thank you.

891
00:41:11,788 --> 00:41:13,257
Here, just think...

892
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:15,762
I may usher in a new renaissance
in landscape architecture.

893
00:41:15,796 --> 00:41:18,427
I'll certainly have time
to work on my designs.

894
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,787
Do you hear something?

895
00:41:30,862 --> 00:41:33,129
What is that?

896
00:41:33,168 --> 00:41:34,660
It's getting closer.

897
00:41:34,705 --> 00:41:38,270
Wait!

898
00:41:39,282 --> 00:41:40,717
Wait.

899
00:41:40,751 --> 00:41:42,812
We heard you the first time.

900
00:41:42,856 --> 00:41:44,416
Leeta...

901
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,761
don't go.

902
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:49,269
Why not?

903
00:41:49,304 --> 00:41:50,603
Because...

904
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,579
I love you.

905
00:41:53,613 --> 00:41:55,811
And I want you to stay.

906
00:41:58,356 --> 00:42:01,089
I love you, too, Rom.

907
00:42:09,381 --> 00:42:11,374
Oh.

908
00:42:11,419 --> 00:42:13,389
Doctor...

909
00:42:13,423 --> 00:42:14,722
I'm...

910
00:42:14,759 --> 00:42:15,727
sorry.

911
00:42:15,761 --> 00:42:17,492
No. Don't be.

912
00:42:17,532 --> 00:42:19,730
True love should always win.

913
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:22,264
I'm... happy for you.

914
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:23,608
Really.

915
00:42:23,646 --> 00:42:26,585
You're a sweet, wonderful
and brilliant man.

916
00:42:26,618 --> 00:42:29,454
There's someone out there
for you, Doctor.

917
00:42:29,492 --> 00:42:31,622
I know it.

918
00:42:31,663 --> 00:42:33,360
I don't think so.

919
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,239
Perhaps I'm better suited
to a life of solitary research.

920
00:42:39,748 --> 00:42:42,880
And dedication
to my chosen field of study.

921
00:42:42,921 --> 00:42:44,116
Don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.

922
00:42:44,157 --> 00:42:45,216
Good-bye.

923
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,559
Bye.

924
00:42:46,596 --> 00:42:47,825
Excuse me, are you familiar

925
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:50,064
with the ancient text
known as the <i>Kama Sutra?</i>

926
00:42:50,103 --> 00:42:51,595
You remind me of an etching...

927
00:42:52,609 --> 00:42:54,272
Dabo!

928
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:03,363
Oh, not my day.

929
00:43:03,399 --> 00:43:05,369
Not your week.

930
00:43:05,404 --> 00:43:06,372
You know what, Chief?

931
00:43:06,406 --> 00:43:08,171
I never got a chance
to thank you

932
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,200
for what you said...

933
00:43:09,245 --> 00:43:10,270
Ah. None of that.

934
00:43:10,315 --> 00:43:13,048
Especially not
in the middle of a game.

935
00:43:13,087 --> 00:43:15,057
Ooh.

936
00:43:15,091 --> 00:43:16,059
Yes!

937
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,688
Looks like it's your game again.

938
00:43:17,731 --> 00:43:19,132
What's that?
Five in a row?

939
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,466
At least.

940
00:43:22,776 --> 00:43:24,370
Wait a minute.

941
00:43:24,413 --> 00:43:27,784
You haven't been letting
me win, have you?

942
00:43:29,757 --> 00:43:31,784
What makes you think that?

943
00:43:31,828 --> 00:43:34,493
You said your hand/eye
coordination

944
00:43:34,535 --> 00:43:36,836
had been genetically enhanced.

945
00:43:36,873 --> 00:43:39,937
Well, maybe I have been
letting you win...

946
00:43:40,013 --> 00:43:41,346
a little bit.

947
00:43:41,383 --> 00:43:42,818
I don't believe it.

948
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:45,620
I don't need you
to patronize me.

949
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:47,926
I can... play at your level.

950
00:43:47,964 --> 00:43:49,193
I never said you couldn't.

951
00:43:49,233 --> 00:43:51,203
Well, play then.

952
00:43:51,238 --> 00:43:52,832
Really play.

953
00:44:16,493 --> 00:44:18,292
All right.

954
00:44:18,331 --> 00:44:19,492
From now on...

955
00:44:21,338 --> 00:44:23,171
you play from over here.

956
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:25,144
I play from up here.

957
00:44:25,179 --> 00:44:26,374
And if that doesn't work...

958
00:44:27,651 --> 00:44:30,088
we'll try a blindfold.
