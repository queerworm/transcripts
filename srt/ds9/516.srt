1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,253
Okay, that's 12 spins,

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,672
and not a single dabo
so far.

3
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:06,173
The pot is growing

4
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,008
and someone's going
to be a big winner...

5
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:18,560
Today's the day,
Brother.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,228
I'm really going
to do it this time.

7
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,189
You've been saying
that for weeks.

8
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,565
I've been waiting
for the right moment,

9
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,526
and this is it.
Now?

10
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,068
It's perfect.

11
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:29,279
She's about to go on a break,
and when she does,

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,031
she'll come over here
and say hi to me,

13
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,283
like she always does,

14
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:36,411
and that's when I'll<i> do it.</i>

15
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,288
Okay, let's hear it.

16
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,541
I... uh...

17
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,793
Leeta, would you like...

18
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:46,421
maybe... to...
one night...

19
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,508
soon... to... maybe...?

20
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:50,676
Rom.

21
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,177
You're a regular poet.

22
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,721
I can do better.

23
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,472
Prove it.

24
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,894
Hi, Rom.

25
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:02,938
Hello, Leeta.

26
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,533
Bye.

27
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,831
(<i> sighing</i> )

28
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,460
I must be doing
something wrong.

29
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,795
I don't know, Leeta.

30
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,297
Maybe he's just not
interested in you.

31
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,592
Well, I know he likes me.

32
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:35,220
Likes you, yes, but
he's an engineer.

33
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,597
A problem solver.

34
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,559
He needs a woman with
a body and brains.

35
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:43,062
I have brains.

36
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:44,772
Sure you do, honey.

37
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:46,899
That's why I hired you.

38
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,401
Now, eat up, and then
take those brains

39
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:52,153
back to the
dabo wheel,

40
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,823
where the customers can get
a good, long look at them.

41
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,497
(<i> dartboard beeps</i> )

42
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,958
BASHIR:
Triple 20!

43
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,588
Oh, he's back
in the zone today.

44
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,548
I never really left it.

45
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,549
Just been giving you

46
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,175
a chance
to get even.

47
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,678
Thank you,
but I don't need your charity.

48
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,346
Another game?

49
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,807
Maybe one.

50
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,182
I promised Molly

51
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,102
I'd do some coloring
with her this afternoon.

52
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:24,812
With all this attention
focused on the baby,

53
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,313
I don't want her
to start feeling

54
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,815
that we've forgotten
about her.

55
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:30,400
A father's work
is never done.
You said it.

56
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,736
Still, it's worth it.

57
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:35,238
You should give it
a try sometime.

58
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,490
Me? No.

59
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,866
Why not?

60
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,618
I bet you'd make
a great father.

61
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:42,746
I'm not exactly a family type.

62
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,372
MAN:
Dr. Bashir,
I presume?

63
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,416
That's me.

64
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,876
I'm Louis Zimmerman

65
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,711
director of holographic imaging
and programming

66
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,506
at the Jupiter Research Station,
and I'm here to make you...

67
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,049
immortal.

68
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,758
You're familiar, of course,

69
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,969
with the Emergency
Medical Holographic program.

70
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,553
I've heard of it.

71
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,639
It's a hologram designed
to provide assistance

72
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,348
during emergencies
in Sick Bay.

73
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,684
It does much more than
provide assistance.

74
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,854
A holographic doctor
can literally replace
a starship's medical officer

75
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,648
during an emergency.

76
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,025
I'm surprised you don't
have one on the station.

77
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,611
The station facilities
are Cardassian in origin.

78
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,655
Most of our equipment
is incompatible

79
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,115
with Federation technology.

80
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:24,283
How unfortunate for you.

81
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:26,201
In any case, the
original EMH program

82
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,162
was designed for
short-term use only

83
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:30,289
but now Starfleet
has requested a program

84
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,249
designed to operate
as a full-time doctor.

85
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,042
Full time?

86
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,837
You're not talking
about replacing real doctors?

87
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:37,879
No, no, of course not.

88
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,547
Why is everyone so worried

89
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,382
about holograms taking
over the universe?

90
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,677
There are many situations
where a holo-doctor

91
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,344
could be more beneficial
than a humanoid.

92
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,805
Research outposts,

93
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,348
subspace communication
stations,

94
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,226
long-range exploratory
vessels.

95
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,853
In short, anywhere
that life support,

96
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,104
or living space
is at a premium

97
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,190
and where the
primary mission

98
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,441
does not require the
doctor to leave Sick Bay.
I see.

99
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,028
And they want to model
this new EMH program

100
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,154
after Dr. Bashir.

101
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:03,947
Technically, it
is an LMH--

102
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,824
long-term medical
holographic program.

103
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,451
And, yes, Starfleet Medical
has selected Dr. Bashir

104
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,911
to provide
the template.

105
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,663
Who was the template
for the EMH?

106
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,499
Me.
It was my program
after all.

107
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,169
It only seemed logical
to use myself as a model.

108
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,004
Of course.

109
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,714
This must be quite an honor.

110
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,965
Yes, it... is

111
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,759
quite a feather in my cap, sir.

112
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,346
It is nothing less than
a shot at immortality.

113
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,223
The original EMH program
will probably

114
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,765
still be in use
for decades to come.

115
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:34,311
The LMH will undoubtedly
last far longer than that.

116
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,605
That is, if<i> I</i> can work out
certain technical problems.

117
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,274
Now, I'll need
to remain here

118
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,026
for at least
three weeks.

119
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,486
I'll need quarters,
access to your main computer,

120
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,197
a technician to
install my equipment,

121
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:46,948
a high-speed data
link with my lab--

122
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,034
Doctor, my First Officer,
Major Kira

123
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,577
will see
to all your needs.

124
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,454
Congratulations,
Doctor.

125
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:56,124
I know I speak
for everyone on the station

126
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,168
when I say we're really
very proud of you.

127
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,378
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

128
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:00,545
Let's go.

129
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,929
BASHIR:
This is a long
questionnaire.

130
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,348
ZIMMERMAN:
I pride myself
on my attention to detail.

131
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,850
Let's see...
"compare and contrast

132
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,852
"your eating habits
at age five

133
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,187
"with those of ten,

134
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,356
15, 20 and 25."

135
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,775
ZIMMERMAN:
It will be necessary
for the holo-doctor

136
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,985
to interact naturally
with patients for weeks,

137
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,653
possibly even months.

138
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:28,198
The doctor will be expected
to share amusing anecdotes,

139
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,867
extend sympathy,
swap dirty jokes,

140
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,535
and even have
culinary opinions

141
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,912
formed by experience.

142
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,872
You mean this program
is going to include

143
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,832
all his personal
likes and dislikes?

144
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,876
That is why we bother to choose

145
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,254
a human template
in the first place.

146
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,214
O'BRIEN:
Wow. Think
of it, Julian.

147
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,925
If this thing works,
you'll be able to irritate

148
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,344
hundreds of people
you've never even met.

149
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,762
(<i> laughs</i> )

150
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,139
If you two could suspend

151
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,099
your oh-so-amusing banter
for the moment,

152
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,810
I'd like to begin
the optical parameter scans.

153
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,395
What do you want me to do?

154
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,939
Just stand there
and look like a doctor.

155
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,942
If you can.

156
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:07,528
Dabo!

157
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,908
We don't have
anything like this

158
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:12,993
on Jupiter Station.

159
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,077
Or like her.

160
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,536
She's beautiful,
isn't she?

161
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,746
Who is she?

162
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,206
Her name's Leeta.

163
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,707
My ex-girlfriend.

164
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,378
Who broke it off?

165
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,796
She did.

166
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:28,342
Oh. I like her
already.

167
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,850
I think I'll have
to add her name

168
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,935
to my list
of interviews.

169
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,228
Interviews?

170
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,189
I'll be conducting
in-depth interviews

171
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,941
with your friends,
colleagues, family members,

172
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,110
in order to build
a more rounded

173
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,279
psychological profile
for the LMH.

174
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,490
I see.

175
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,700
Well, regarding
my family members, um...

176
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,743
would you refrain from--

177
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,496
ODO:
Excuse me
for interrupting, Doctor.

178
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:58,788
Doctor.

179
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,415
The Antidean transport

180
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,250
wishes to leave
the station a day early.

181
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,252
Their cargo is still
under quarantine.

182
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,879
If you could issue
a health certificate...

183
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,838
Now?

184
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,423
It would expedite matters.

185
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,757
All right. Um...

186
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:13,011
I'll meet you in Cargo Bay 3
in ten minutes.

187
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,595
Thank you, Doctor.

188
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,056
Doctor.

189
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,725
Well, duty calls.

190
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,561
I wonder if you
could do me a favor

191
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,688
and consider
not interviewing my parents?

192
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,482
Why?

193
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,150
Well, to be blunt, um...

194
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,694
we're not close,
and we haven't been
for many years,

195
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,571
and I would consider it
a personal favor

196
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,408
if you would sort of
leave my parents out of it.

197
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,201
I see.

198
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,660
Well, I certainly
understand.

199
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,953
Well, thank you.

200
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,415
Um... I-I'll see you
tomorrow.

201
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,623
Hmm.

202
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:52,133
Note: Contact subject's parents
immediately.

203
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,767
ZIMMERMAN:
Computer, activate
LMH Test Program 1.

204
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:06,481
Does it meet
with your... approval?

205
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,066
Yeah, it looks all right.

206
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,068
Except for the eyes--
they seem a little dead.

207
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,611
They don't have
that certain sparkle...

208
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,321
the zest for life
that greets me

209
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,739
in the mirror
every morning.

210
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,367
(<i> sighs</i> )
This is a test run.

211
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,744
I can assure you that
the final product will be...

212
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,079
"zesty."

213
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,622
Does it talk?
Not yet.

214
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,374
First, I have to load the LMH

215
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,209
with the basic database
and software configurations

216
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,420
of the original program.

217
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,381
Computer.
Activate the EMH.

218
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,633
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

219
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,135
This is a level-3
diagnostic.

220
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,719
I understand.

221
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,888
Diagnostics look good.

222
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,391
Beginning
data transferal.

223
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,017
Data transferal?

224
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,188
Am I being replaced?

225
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,191
You're being supplemented
by a new long-term program.

226
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,026
By<i> him?</i>

227
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,778
ZIMMERMAN:
There.
Transfer's complete.

228
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,030
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

229
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,574
Well, that's original.

230
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,076
He doesn't even look old
enough to be a doctor.

231
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,328
If you'd
like<i> my</i> advice,

232
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,954
you should delete
this program.

233
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,998
Now that<i> I'm</i> here,
why would you need

234
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,874
an archaic piece
of software like him?

235
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,460
Archaic?

236
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,129
We can discuss this
at another time.

237
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,506
Listen--

238
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:14,424
He doesn't sound
much like me.

239
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,467
I'm sorry.

240
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,344
<i>Too</i> zesty for you?

241
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,554
Actually, he sounds
more like<i> you.</i>

242
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:22,516
As I said,
I've loaded the LMH

243
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:25,435
with the basic EMH
software package.

244
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,562
We'll have to build
a new set of algorithms

245
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:30,106
based on<i> your</i>
scintillating personality.

246
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,732
I hope you're
more interesting

247
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,276
than you seem.

248
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,570
I'd hate to be boring.

249
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,364
There may be
no preventing that.

250
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:41,034
But we'll see
what his friends have to say.

251
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,078
ZIMMERMAN:
What were your initial
impressions of Dr. Bashir?

252
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,122
Good<i> and</i> bad.

253
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,666
Young, eager, ambitious.

254
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,334
He was fresh out
of medical school.

255
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,751
Looking forward
to his first taste

256
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,004
of "frontier medicine."

257
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,549
Sometimes, he let
that natural impulse

258
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,800
override his sense of decorum.

259
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,011
You mean he was...
difficult.

260
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,805
No, but sometimes he could...

261
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,517
well, give you
<i>way</i> too much information.

262
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,101
Could you
elaborate on that?

263
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,103
Sometimes, he just...

264
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,523
didn't know when to shut up.

265
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,024
Are you implying
he harassed you

266
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,652
with unwanted
advances?

267
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:19,447
No, but he was<i> </i>
<i>very</i> persistent.

268
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,032
I see.

269
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,701
Could you be
more specific?

270
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,828
You're not being
very helpful.

271
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,497
I do not like doctors.

272
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,040
<i>Any</i> doctors.

273
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,543
You can rest assured
that I will keep
anything you say

274
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,670
in the strictest
confidence.

275
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,338
You're sure about that?

276
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,340
I wouldn't want this
to get back to Julian.

277
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,342
You have my word.

278
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:43,304
Well, the truth is,
he's... an extraordinary person.

279
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,224
A real sense of honor
and integrity...

280
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,642
great sense of humor...

281
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:49,768
warm, caring...

282
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:52,731
You're sure
he's not going to read this?

283
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:53,981
Positive.

284
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,316
So, is that all?

285
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,906
Uh... there<i> is</i>
one other thing.

286
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,620
Would you have dinner
with me this evening?

287
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,900
WOMAN:
Oh, well,<i> that</i> I'm
not going to tell you--

288
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,902
MAN:
Well, I think
you should--

289
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,155
WOMAN 2:
Times like this, I think
I'm the happiest person--

290
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,864
MAN 2:
Stroll along the promenade--

291
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,117
LEETA:
You want a real
game, try dom-jot.

292
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,702
If<i> I</i> ran this place,

293
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,412
we'd have three
dom-jot tables

294
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,289
and two prayko alleys.

295
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,874
And I'd make sure
the customers
had a lot more fun.

296
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,169
Quark is a lot of things,
but he's<i> not</i> fun.

297
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,420
I'm fun.

298
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,630
I bet you are.

299
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:03,510
You're a fascinating
woman, Leeta.

300
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,927
For a dabo girl.

301
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,429
ZIMMERMAN:
Not at all.

302
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,846
You're charming,

303
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,474
intelligent,
witty...

304
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:12,059
and extraordinarily
beautiful.

305
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,520
Thank you.

306
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,147
ROM:
Excuse me!

307
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,317
I need to talk to you.

308
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,738
It's very important.

309
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,532
All right.

310
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,703
Will you excuse me?

311
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,162
Of course.

312
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,963
What is it, Rom?

313
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,757
I want to ask you if you...

314
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,553
I want to...

315
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,179
I... oh...

316
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,726
I wanted to ask if...

317
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,769
tomorrow morning
would be a good time

318
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,270
for me to fix
your replicator.

319
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,565
Oh.

320
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,526
Sure.

321
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,152
That would be fine.

322
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,362
Okay.

323
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,740
Tomorrow morning, then.

324
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,409
Enjoy the rest
of your evening.

325
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,787
Thanks.

326
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:22,213
I'm a little concerned
about the amount of argonite

327
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,549
that's seeping into
the station's air supply.

328
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,050
17 parts per million.

329
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,469
That's well within
safety margins.

330
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,805
Yes, but it's on the rise,
and I'd like to--

331
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,767
I'm sorry to interrupt, sir,

332
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,894
but there are a couple of
visitors here looking for Julian

333
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:37,103
and I thought he might

334
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,897
want to see them
right away.

335
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:41,023
Well, send them in.

336
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,824
Oh...

337
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,117
my God.

338
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,577
Hello, Jules.

339
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,089
Uh, Captain...

340
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:09,302
allow me to introduce
Amsha and...

341
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,971
Richard Bashir,
my parents.

342
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,563
I'm Captain Benjamin Sisko.

343
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,982
Welcome to Deep Space 9.

344
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,651
Thank you, Captain.

345
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,694
It's a pleasure to finally see
where Jules works.

346
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,070
We wanted to come before,

347
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,364
but my schedule's
been so busy up until now.

348
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,450
I'm sure you know
what it's like.

349
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,160
SISKO:
All too well,
I'm afraid.

350
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,663
What is it you do,
Mr. Bashir?

351
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,332
Oh... I've done many things.

352
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,793
At the moment, I'm involved
in landscape architecture,

353
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,544
designing public spaces,
parks mostly.

354
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,213
I love the idea of
working on projects

355
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,048
that thousands of
people will enjoy

356
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,300
long after I'm gone.

357
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,677
They're my... my legacy,

358
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,637
my gift to succeeding
generations.

359
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,556
Aside from Jules
here, of course.

360
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,224
You must be very
proud of your son.

361
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,434
Oh, yes.

362
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,562
He's a very...
gifted young man.

363
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,230
I hope you're putting
all his talents

364
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,649
to good use, Captain.

365
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:05,692
We try.

366
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:06,901
Well, sometimes

367
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,695
you have to push
him a little.

368
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,947
It took quite a while
to talk him into
taking up medicine.

369
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:11,948
But he did.

370
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,032
So<i> you're</i> the reason

371
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,325
he went to medical school.

372
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,786
That's right.
He wanted to become--

373
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,747
Perhaps we should save that
until another time, Richard.

374
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,916
I'm sure the Captain
is a very busy man.

375
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,335
Oh...
of course.

376
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,295
Maybe after our
interviews are over.

377
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,630
Interviews?

378
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,966
Yes, with a Dr.
um... Zimmerman.

379
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,175
Didn't he tell you?

380
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,302
No, he didn't.

381
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,762
He said it was urgent.

382
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:35,972
That the two of you
were working together

383
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,473
on a very important project,

384
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,809
and that we had to
come here right away.

385
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,020
Yes.
Well, why don't I see

386
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,980
if I can find you some
accommodations for this evening.

387
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,025
Yeah.
It was a pleasure
to meet you both.

388
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,151
I hope we get a chance
to see you again.

389
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,904
I can't wait
to hear some stories

390
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,405
about Julian
as a little boy.

391
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,032
Oh, lord,
there are so many.

392
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,992
You know, from the time
he was this high,

393
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,160
we knew he was destined
for greatness.

394
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,539
The captain, Father,
is a very busy man.

395
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:02,916
We'll talk later.

396
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,973
(<i> chuckling</i> )

397
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:22,101
Oh, we're just
working out a few bugs.

398
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,728
Chief, if you'll
excuse us,

399
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:26,355
I'd like a moment or two
alone with Dr. Zimmerman.

400
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,857
Of course.

401
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,483
You brought my parents
to this station

402
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,693
against my explicit wishes

403
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,361
that you keep them
out of this project.

404
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,822
I'm sorry it upsets you,
but their input is--

405
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,449
You had no right
to bring them here.

406
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,825
I did not bring
them here.

407
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,702
I simply issued
an invitation.

408
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,412
You said it was urgent.

409
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:42,413
It<i> is</i> urgent-- to me.

410
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,206
Like it or not,

411
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,000
they're an important
part of your background

412
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,835
and I need
to interview them.

413
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,546
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a delivery to make.

414
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,265
(<i> door chimes</i> )

415
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,066
Have I caught you
at a bad time?

416
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,693
It's never a bad time
for flowers.

417
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,194
Come on in.

418
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,697
Could you find a place
for those while I change?

419
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,157
Of course.

420
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:24,080
By the way, if you're
trying to impress me...

421
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,957
you've succeeded.

422
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,128
I spoke to some of my colleagues

423
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,672
at the Jupiter Station
this morning.

424
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:36,342
It seems that the manager
of our station café

425
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:39,637
has decided to quit.
Really?

426
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,140
They're still looking
for a new manager.

427
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,850
Someone with experience

428
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,978
in both food service
and entertainment.

429
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:48,813
Someone like you.

430
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,648
Me?

431
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,985
Y-yes. I've already
taken the liberty

432
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:56,821
of speaking to our station's
commanding officer about you,

433
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,238
and she's amenable to the idea.

434
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,491
The café is yours
if you want it.

435
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:03,494
My own café?

436
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,332
Oh.

437
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,500
Sorry.

438
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,002
Not at all.

439
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,881
It's not very big.

440
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,884
Less than half the size
of Quark's.
Really?

441
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:20,053
But there's room enough
for a couple of dom-jot tables.

442
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:22,138
But I've never run a restaurant

443
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,263
or<i> any</i> kind of business.

444
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,725
I barely even know
how to tend bar.

445
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,728
That puts you one step ahead
of our last bartender.

446
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,604
But where would I stay?

447
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,066
I don't even know anybody there.

448
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,608
You know<i> me...</i>

449
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,570
and I was hoping you would
consider staying with me.

450
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,446
But Louis...

451
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:40,948
I just met you.

452
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,867
I mean, I like you--

453
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,619
You see? You're warming up
to me already.

454
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,705
Given time,
you might begin to feel more.

455
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,209
Just as I do.

456
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:54,420
Besides, you said
you liked cerebral men,

457
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,172
and, at the risk
of sounding immodest,

458
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,506
I have a towering intellect.

459
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,512
Come with me, Leeta.
Please.

460
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,681
I promise
you won't regret it.

461
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,767
I know I won't.

462
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,022
I need to think about that.

463
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,818
Take all the time you need.

464
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,632
Captain Sisko seems
like a very nice man, Jules.

465
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,300
Not like the Captain
of the transport

466
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,927
that brought us here.

467
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:45,721
I've never met a ruder,
more abrasive man in my life.

468
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,681
I tell you, when I
used to run shuttles,

469
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,184
I never would've tolerated
that kind of behavior

470
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,685
towards my passengers.

471
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,437
Dad, you're talking
to<i> me</i> now.

472
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,439
You were
a third-class steward

473
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,983
for all of six months.

474
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,279
That's right...
and I was required

475
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,239
to have daily contact
with the passengers.

476
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,324
And you can bet that if I even
looked at them the wrong way,

477
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,659
I would've been discharged
on the spot.

478
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,494
I thought you were.

479
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:09,954
No.

480
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,371
I resigned.

481
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,668
Are you still doing research,
Jules?

482
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:19,172
Yes. Right now, I'm working
on two studies

483
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:22,216
of prion replication
in ganglionic cell clusters.

484
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,135
You could've done research
back on Earth.

485
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:25,636
I told you that five years ago.

486
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:28,264
But you insisted
on taking this position

487
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:31,725
because you wanted to work in,
um... frontier medicine.

488
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,728
On DS9, I can do both.

489
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:38,565
So, you're doing

490
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,567
"landscape architecture" now.

491
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,486
It's all he can talk about.

492
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,822
You should see the stacks
of drawings in our house.

493
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,824
It's like living
in a drafting studio.

494
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,326
Some, uh, very important people

495
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:50,744
have expressed interest
in my park designs.

496
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,289
I have some very good prospects
on the horizon.

497
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,666
Oh, you always have
very good prospects

498
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,085
and they were always
just<i> over</i> that horizon.

499
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,505
Um... maybe you should tell us

500
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,342
about the interviews
we're doing tomorrow, Jules.

501
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:06,260
What kind of questions
will they ask?

502
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,346
Well, Dr. Zimmerman,
as I understand it,

503
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:11,515
is trying to compile a complete
psychological profile of me.

504
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:14,227
He's going to be asking you
all sorts of questions.

505
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:15,895
Try to keep your answers
as brief

506
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,689
and to the point
as you can.

507
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,816
You don't want to give him
any openings

508
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:21,984
to probe into any...

509
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,694
awkward areas.

510
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,738
I'm sure we can handle it.

511
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,865
Try not to take this
too lightly.

512
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,575
He's going to be asking detailed
questions about my childhood,

513
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,869
and if you're
not careful--
You don't trust us?

514
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,662
He didn't say
that, Richard.

515
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,413
No, but that's what he meant,
isn't it?

516
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:36,874
You think we're
going to slip up,

517
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:38,625
say the wrong thing,
get us all in trouble?

518
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,460
Look, I've got
a lot at stake here.

519
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,129
My whole career
could be destroyed

520
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,590
if Dr. Zimmerman gets wind
of<i> our</i> little secret.

521
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,342
<i>You've</i> got a lot at stake?

522
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,467
Well, what about us?

523
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,262
We could go
to prison, Jules.

524
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:50,763
Have you ever thought
about that?

525
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,514
Of course I've thought
about that!

526
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:55,059
That's why I want you
to<i> take this seriously!</i>

527
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:56,769
Ah, so now we're not
taking it seriously.

528
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,020
We're not as bright as he is.

529
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,855
We don't have
your gifted intellect

530
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,024
so we can't see
the perfectly obvious.

531
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,693
This is exactly why I haven't
been home in three years.

532
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,695
Jules, please--
No, let him go.

533
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,614
He can barely stand to be

534
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:09,990
in the same room
with us!

535
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,491
(<i> door closes</i> )

536
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,161
(<i> sighs</i> )

537
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:23,461
I haven't made up my mind, yet.

538
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:25,423
I mean, this could be
a big opportunity,

539
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:27,674
but that's no reason
to rush into anything.

540
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,096
What do you think I should do?

541
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,139
I...

542
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:35,641
I...

543
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,435
I don't know.

544
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:38,936
(<i> sighing</i> )

545
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:42,856
If I had a reason to stay,
I'd stay.

546
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,612
Do I have a reason to stay?

547
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,947
I...

548
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,284
I don't know.

549
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,663
Well, I...

550
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,790
guess I better take the job.

551
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,834
Great.

552
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,127
Is that all you can say?

553
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:04,170
I...

554
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,087
I...

555
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,505
I--
You don't know.

556
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,302
Thanks, Rom.

557
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:13,387
You've been a big help.

558
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,310
You're welcome.

559
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:30,070
Is there something
I can do for you?

560
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,490
Your father has something
he wants to say.

561
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,616
Richard?

562
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,118
(<i> clearing throat</i> )

563
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:39,163
It's a... stressful time
for all of us,

564
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:42,916
and maybe I said some things
I... shouldn't have.

565
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,211
AMSHA:
What he's trying
to say is

566
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:48,130
we would never do anything
to jeopardize your career.

567
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,341
And just so there's
no misunderstanding,

568
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,259
I give you my word
that, at no time

569
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,303
in our interview
with Dr. Zimmerman

570
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,847
will we ever mention,
or even hint at the fact

571
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:59,308
that you were genetically
enhanced as a child.

572
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:00,476
AMSHA:
Jules, you can trust us.

573
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:01,768
Your father and I

574
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,896
kept the secret of
your DNA resequencing

575
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,605
for almost 25 years

576
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,149
and we're not going
to let it out now.

577
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:09,902
RICHARD:
But I would just add

578
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,654
that, despite what
the authorities
would like us to believe,

579
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,115
genetic engineering is nothing
to be ashamed of.

580
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,701
You're not any less human
than anyone else.

581
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,370
In fact,
you're a little more.

582
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,122
We didn't come here
to start another fight.

583
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,166
Let's just try to
get through this.

584
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,625
All right?

585
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,547
All right.

586
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,242
Who are<i> those</i> people?

587
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,085
(<i> sighing</i> )

588
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:14,550
I can't believe
you set them up like that!

589
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,842
We didn't set them up.

590
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,261
They just happened to walk in

591
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:19,179
while the program
was running.

592
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,098
Zimmerman thought it
would be a good idea

593
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:22,891
to test the
program's ability

594
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,810
to cope with an
unexpected situation.

595
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,520
And you let them go on?

596
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,564
You let them stand there
and make fools of themselves

597
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:31,567
while the two of you
sat in the back room
and laughed?!

598
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,319
Look, I'm sorry about this.

599
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,195
I wish it had never happened.

600
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,448
But it has, and now
we've got a problem.

601
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:40,117
I don't want to talk about it.

602
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:41,868
Julian, Zimmerman
is going to file a report

603
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,954
saying that
Dr. Bashir

604
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,747
is unsuitable
for computer modeling

605
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:50,377
because of his suspected
genetically enhanced background.

606
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:53,005
Do you know what's going
to happen when that report

607
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,007
gets back to
Starfleet Medical?

608
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,594
There's going to be
a formal investigation.

609
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:04,642
Which will lead
to my eventual dismissal

610
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:06,977
from the service.

611
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:08,228
Then it's true?

612
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:10,939
You're...

613
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:14,109
The word you're looking for

614
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,278
is "unnatural,"

615
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:19,490
meaning "not from nature."

616
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:27,623
"Freak"
or "monster"

617
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:30,543
would also be acceptable.

618
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:37,007
I was six.

619
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:39,968
Small for my age, a bit
awkward, physically

620
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,428
not very bright.

621
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,888
In the first grade

622
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,473
when the other children
were learning

623
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,559
how to read and write
and use the computer,

624
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,896
I was still trying
to tell a dog from a cat

625
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:53,273
and a tree from a house.

626
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:56,360
I didn't really understand
what was happening.

627
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,905
I knew that I wasn't doing
as well as my classmates.

628
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:04,326
There were so many concepts
that they took for granted

629
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:07,621
that... I couldn't
begin to master,

630
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:10,583
and I didn't know why.

631
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:14,628
All I knew... was that I

632
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:16,922
was a great disappointment
to my parents.

633
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:22,802
I don't remember when
they made the decision,

634
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:27,266
but just before
my seventh birthday...

635
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:32,896
we left Earth
for Adigeon Prime.

636
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:36,650
At first, I remember
being really excited

637
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,069
at seeing all the
aliens in the hospital,

638
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:43,907
and then they gave me a room
and... began the treatments,

639
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:47,703
and my entire world
began to change.

640
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,373
What were
the treatments?

641
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:54,126
Some kind
of DNA recoding?

642
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,502
(<i> sighing</i> )

643
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,463
The technical term

644
00:29:57,463 --> 00:30:01,216
is "accelerated critical
neural pathway formation."

645
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,343
Over the course of
the next two months,

646
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,345
my genetic structure
was manipulated

647
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,347
to accelerate the growth
of neuronal networks

648
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,182
in my cerebral cortex

649
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:12,311
and a whole new
Julian Bashir

650
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:13,771
was born.

651
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:17,065
In what way did they...

652
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,942
change you?

653
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:22,028
Well, my mental abilities
were top priority, of course.

654
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:25,324
My IQ jumped five points a day
for over two weeks.

655
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:28,535
Followed by improvements
in my hand/eye coordination,

656
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:32,623
stamina, vision, reflexes,
weight, height.

657
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:34,833
In the end, everything
but my name

658
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,418
was altered in some way.

659
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,711
When we returned
to Earth,

660
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:39,588
we even moved to
a different city.

661
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,465
I was enrolled
in a new school

662
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,258
using falsified records

663
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,552
my parents obtained
somewhere.

664
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,472
Instead of being
the slowest learner,

665
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,766
I was the star pupil.

666
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,018
And no one ever suspected?

667
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:55,979
Oh, there's no stigma
attached to success, Chief.

668
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,898
After the treatments,
I never looked back,

669
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:02,444
but the truth is, I'm a fraud.

670
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,279
You're not a fraud.

671
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,323
I don't care
how many enhancements

672
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:07,825
your parents had done.

673
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:10,494
Genetic recoding
can't give you ambition

674
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,579
or a personality or compassion

675
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:16,416
or any of the things
that make a person truly human.

676
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,877
Well, Starfleet Medical
won't see it that way.

677
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,587
DNA resequencing for any reason

678
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:23,465
other than repairing serious
birth defects is illegal.

679
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,217
Any genetically enhanced
human being

680
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:27,135
is barred from serving
in Starfleet

681
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,262
or practicing medicine.

682
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,807
I don't think
there's been a case

683
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,892
dealing with any of this
in a hundred years.

684
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,687
You can't be sure
how they'll react.

685
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:38,605
Oh, I<i> am</i> sure.

686
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,399
Once the truth comes out,

687
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,609
I'll be cashiered
from the service.

688
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,528
It's that simple.

689
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,905
There must be
something we can do.
We can't just give up.

690
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,117
There is something I can do.

691
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,536
Resign

692
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:53,995
before Dr. Zimmerman
files his report.

693
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,873
Oh, Julian--

694
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:56,998
It's over, Miles.

695
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,042
I always knew this could happen.

696
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,502
Now it has.

697
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:03,714
Now, if you'll excuse me,

698
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:05,758
I'd like to be alone.

699
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,804
(<i> sighs</i> )

700
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:25,944
I should have told her
how I felt.

701
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,029
Thank the Nagus
that you didn't.

702
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,365
Remember what happened
with Nog's mother?

703
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,619
Yeah...

704
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,954
don't want to think
about her, do you?

705
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,249
Let me refresh
your memory.

706
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:41,794
You signed a standard
five-year marriage contract

707
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:43,253
with Prinadora's father

708
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,589
because you wanted
to have a child--

709
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,800
a simple everyday
business deal.

710
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,260
But then, you fell in love
with your wife,

711
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,512
and wanted to extend
the contract.

712
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,972
And you were<i> so</i> in love

713
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,182
that you never bothered
to read the extension

714
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,476
before signing it.

715
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,018
So, in the end,

716
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:02,021
her father swindled you
out of all of your money.

717
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:06,151
Prinadora left you
for a<i> richer</i> man.

718
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,528
And you got stuck
with Nog.

719
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,656
Hooray for romance.

720
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,492
Leeta is not Prinadora.

721
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,786
She's a female, Rom,

722
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:17,454
and the one constant
in the universe is

723
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:18,956
females are trouble.

724
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:25,504
Look, if you're lonely...

725
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,841
I've got
a new holosuite program.

726
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,385
"Vulcan Love Slave:
Part Two--

727
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,804
The Revenge."

728
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,349
Give it a try.

729
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,058
After a couple hours...

730
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,478
you'll forget
all about Leeta.

731
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,116
We're not going to just
take this lying down,

732
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,285
that's for sure.
I'll arrange for legal counsel.

733
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,162
We're going to fight this
all the way

734
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,664
to the Federation
Supreme Court.

735
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:02,916
We can't fight this.

736
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,459
You better change that attitude
right now

737
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,795
if you want to hang on
to your career.

738
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:07,880
Jules, listen
to your father.

739
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,047
He's trying
to help you.

740
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,008
Neither of you
is listening to me.

741
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:13,092
I don't want to drag this
through the courts.

742
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,594
We're a little
beyond worrying

743
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,513
about your wants, Jules.

744
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:19,474
We have a serious problem here
and we have to stop the whining

745
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,101
and concentrate
on coming up with a new plan.

746
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,687
A new plan.

747
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,063
Yes!

748
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,357
Let's come up with a new plan!

749
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:29,192
That's the way we do things
in this family, isn't it?

750
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,611
We don't face our problems.
We come up with new plans.

751
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,864
Don't like your job?
Well, move along
to the next one.

752
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:36,199
Don't like the law?
Well, find a way
to get around it.

753
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,200
But whatever you do,

754
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,704
do not accept responsibility.

755
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:42,873
All those gifts...

756
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:45,166
all those accomplishments...

757
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,836
and you still want to behave
like a spoiled child.

758
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,713
Well, you better grow up
right now

759
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,715
or you're going
to lose<i> everything.</i>

760
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:53,592
You mean,<i> you're</i> going
to lose everything.

761
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,886
You're going to lose
your only

762
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:58,137
real accomplishment
in this life--

763
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,556
<i>me.</i>

764
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:01,934
You said before,
I'm your legacy,

765
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:04,102
your proud gift to the world.

766
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:08,106
Well, Father, your gift
is about to be revealed...

767
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,900
as a fraud.

768
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,526
Just like you.

769
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:15,280
I'm still your father, Jules,

770
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,075
and I will not have you
talk to me like that.

771
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:19,325
No.

772
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:22,579
You<i> used</i> to be my father.

773
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:25,874
Now... you're my architect.

774
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:28,877
The man who designed
a better son

775
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:33,757
to replace the defective one
he was given.

776
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:37,135
Well, your design...
has a built-in flaw.

777
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,178
It's illegal.

778
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,014
You're so smart.

779
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:43,182
You know so much you can
sit there and judge us,

780
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,560
but you're still
not smart enough to see

781
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,730
that we saved you from a life
of remedial education

782
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,898
and underachievement!

783
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,399
You don't know that.

784
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,401
You didn't give me a chance.

785
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,194
You were
falling behind.

786
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,738
I was six years old.

787
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,740
You decided
I was a failure

788
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,075
in the first grade.

789
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:01,493
You don't understand, Jules.

790
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:02,953
You never did.

791
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:04,370
No,<i> you</i> don't understand!

792
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,998
I stopped calling myself
Jules when I was 15,

793
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:07,624
and I'd found out
what you'd done to me.

794
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:10,251
I'm Julian!
What difference
does that make?!

795
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,753
It makes every difference!

796
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:12,838
Because<i> I'm</i> different!

797
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,213
Can't you see?!

798
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:16,133
Jules Bashir died
in that hospital

799
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:18,093
because you couldn't
live with the shame

800
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:19,928
of having a son
who didn't measure up!

801
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,346
That's not true.

802
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,222
We were never
ashamed of you-- never.

803
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,599
I'm sorry, Mother,
but the truth is--

804
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,809
You don't know.

805
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,560
You've never had a child.

806
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,271
You don't know what it's like
to watch your son...

807
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:34,026
to watch him fall a little
further behind every day.

808
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:35,610
You know he's trying,

809
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,030
but something's
holding him back.

810
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,949
You don't know what it's like
to stay up every night

811
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:43,618
worrying that maybe
it's your fault.

812
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,454
Maybe you did something wrong
during the pregnancy,

813
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:49,457
or maybe you weren't
careful enough,

814
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,334
or maybe there's something wrong
with you.

815
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,627
Maybe you passed on

816
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,671
a genetic defect
without even knowing it.

817
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:56,089
Amsha...

818
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:57,799
No, this is important.

819
00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:00,135
You can condemn us
for what we did.

820
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:01,720
You can say
it's illegal or immoral

821
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,888
or whatever you want
to say...

822
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:05,473
but you have
to understand

823
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:09,061
that we didn't do it
because we were ashamed...

824
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:11,771
but because
you were our son,

825
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,272
and we loved you.

826
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,122
What do you want us to do?

827
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,918
Nothing.

828
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:39,966
I'm going to visit Captain Sisko
in the morning

829
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,301
and explain
the situation to him,

830
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,971
and tender
my Starfleet resignation.

831
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,557
Are you certain
this is what you want?

832
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,059
Yes.

833
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:56,233
I just... want to leave
the station quietly.

834
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:04,241
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

835
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,089
Come in, Doctor.

836
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:21,174
We were just
talking about you.

837
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:22,842
Admiral, allow me
to introduce

838
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:23,927
Dr. Julian Bashir.

839
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,344
Doctor, this is

840
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,555
Rear Admiral Bennett,
Judge Advocate General.

841
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,765
Admiral.

842
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:30,016
Doctor.

843
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,310
May I ask
what's going on?

844
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,687
Your parents came
to see me this morning.

845
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:37,941
They explained the situation
about your genetic background.

846
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:40,443
I contacted Admiral Bennett
a short time ago.

847
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,694
BENNETT:
We've just reached
an agreement

848
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,238
which will allow you
to retain

849
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,240
both your commission
and your medical practice.

850
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,201
I'm going to prison.

851
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:50,870
What?!
Two years.

852
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,290
It's a minimum security penal
colony in New Zealand.

853
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,250
You can't do this.

854
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,127
BENNETT:
It was your father's
suggestion, Doctor.

855
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:58,336
He pleads guilty

856
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,796
to illegal genetic engineering

857
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:01,840
and in exchange,
you stay in the service.

858
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,800
Well, I want
no part of it.

859
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,052
I'm not going to stand
here while my father--
Jules...

860
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,680
Julian.
Listen to me.

861
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,431
This is my decision.

862
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:14,477
<i>I'm</i> the one who took you
to Adigeon Prime.

863
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:18,273
I'm the one who should, uh...
take responsibility for it.

864
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,694
Let him do this, Julian.

865
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,823
Two years?

866
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:29,075
Isn't that a bit harsh?
BENNETT:
I don't think so.

867
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,661
200 years ago,
we tried to improve the species

868
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:33,872
through DNA resequencing.

869
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:36,624
And what did we get
for our trouble?

870
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,918
The Eugenics Wars.

871
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,587
For every Julian Bashir
that can be created,

872
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,756
there's a Khan Singh
waiting in the wings--

873
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,217
a superhuman--

874
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:46,968
whose ambition
and thirst for power

875
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:50,138
have been enhanced
along with his intellect.

876
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,349
The law
against genetic engineering

877
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:54,600
provides a firewall
against such men,

878
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,979
and it's my job
to keep that firewall intact.

879
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,608
I've made my offer.

880
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,152
Do you accept?

881
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,489
Yes.

882
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,158
Then report to my office
at Starfleet Headquarters

883
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,450
once you arrive on Earth.

884
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:21,336
(<i> whispers</i> ):
Take your time.

885
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,774
Good-bye, Julian.

886
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:43,983
Good-bye, Mother.

887
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:49,155
Well... I guess I'll see you
in a couple of years.

888
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,116
Oh, I'm sure
they have, uh...

889
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:52,700
visiting hours
at your facility.

890
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,119
Maybe I could--

891
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,954
That would be
most welcome.

892
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,422
Father.

893
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,507
Thank you.

894
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,303
Here, just think--

895
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:12,762
I may usher in
a new renaissance

896
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:14,680
in landscape
architecture.

897
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,100
I'll certainly have time
to work on my designs.

898
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,819
(<i> distant wailing yell</i> )

899
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:28,861
Do you hear something?

900
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:31,197
What<i> is</i> that?

901
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,865
It's getting closer.

902
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:36,161
ROM (<i> yelling</i> ):
Wait!

903
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:38,830
Wait.

904
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,832
We heard you
the first time.

905
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,500
Leeta...

906
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,752
don't go.

907
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,339
Why not?

908
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:48,547
Because...

909
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:51,634
I love you.

910
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,803
And I want you
to stay.

911
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:59,142
I love you, too, Rom.

912
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,568
Oh.

913
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,529
Doctor...

914
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,656
I'm... sorry.

915
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,658
No. Don't be.

916
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,910
True love should
always win.

917
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,372
I'm... happy for you.

918
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:21,747
Really.

919
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:24,709
You're a sweet, wonderful
and brilliant man.

920
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:27,628
There's someone out there
for you, Doctor.

921
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,755
I know it.

922
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,341
I don't think so.

923
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:33,176
Perhaps I'm
better suited

924
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:35,720
to a life of
solitary research.

925
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:41,017
And dedication
to my chosen field of study.

926
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:42,143
Don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.

927
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,311
Good-bye.

928
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:44,687
Bye.

929
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,398
Excuse me,
are you familiar

930
00:42:46,398 --> 00:42:48,066
with the ancient text
known as the<i> Kama Sutra?</i>

931
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:49,526
You remind me of an etching...

932
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,320
ALL:
Dabo!

933
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,155
(<i> cheering</i> )

934
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,413
Oh, not my day.

935
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:02,830
Not your week.

936
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,499
You know what,
Chief?

937
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:06,251
I never got a chance
to thank you

938
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:08,378
for what you said--<i> </i>
<i>Ah.</i> None of that.

939
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:11,130
Especially not
in the middle of a game.

940
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,632
Ooh. Yes!

941
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,760
Looks like it's
your game again.

942
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,220
What's that?
Five in a row?

943
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,388
At least.

944
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,392
Wait a minute.

945
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:25,770
You haven't been<i> letting</i>
me win, have you?

946
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,941
What makes you think that?

947
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:32,527
You said your hand/eye
coordination

948
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:34,987
had been
genetically enhanced.

949
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,949
Well, maybe I have been
letting you win...

950
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,367
a little bit.

951
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:40,952
I don't believe it.

952
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:43,662
I don't need you
to patronize me.

953
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:46,082
I can... play
at your level.

954
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:47,250
I never said
you couldn't.

955
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,210
Well, play then.

956
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,795
<i>Really</i> play.

957
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:59,845
(<i> dartboard beeping</i> )

958
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:16,362
All right.

959
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,947
From now on...

960
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:21,242
you play from over here.

961
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:23,161
I play from up here.

962
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:24,579
And if that doesn't work...

963
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,915
we'll try a blindfold.
