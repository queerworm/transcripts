1
00:00:11,351 --> 00:00:13,845
Good morning, Constable.

2
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:16,693
And what can I do for you...
today?

3
00:00:16,764 --> 00:00:18,461
It's my back.

4
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:20,438
Let's take a look.

5
00:00:20,473 --> 00:00:21,703
Oh...

6
00:00:21,743 --> 00:00:24,979
It happened this morning
when I got out of bed.

7
00:00:25,017 --> 00:00:26,042
Hmm.

8
00:00:27,356 --> 00:00:30,261
I have Alvanian
spine mites, don't I?

9
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:31,596
Actually...

10
00:00:31,633 --> 00:00:33,934
I'll be in pain
for the rest of my life.

11
00:00:33,972 --> 00:00:35,875
Odo...

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,040
you have a pinched nerve.

13
00:00:38,082 --> 00:00:40,315
Really?

14
00:00:40,354 --> 00:00:41,755
It comes from bad posture.

15
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:42,885
Me? Ridiculous.

16
00:00:42,926 --> 00:00:45,558
You've never seen
anyone sit so straight.

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,694
Exactly.

18
00:00:46,736 --> 00:00:48,570
You carry yourself too rigidly.

19
00:00:48,607 --> 00:00:51,877
This is how
I've always carried myself.

20
00:00:51,915 --> 00:00:54,786
You haven't always
had a spinal column.

21
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:57,089
You're not a changeling anymore.

22
00:00:57,127 --> 00:01:00,499
Now that you're a humanoid,
you have to learn to relax.

23
00:01:00,535 --> 00:01:02,438
Well, that's what
you said last week.

24
00:01:02,474 --> 00:01:03,464
And?

25
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:05,480
And it helped.

26
00:01:05,514 --> 00:01:07,576
That and the prune juice.

27
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,590
There. You see?

28
00:01:09,624 --> 00:01:10,592
Uh-huh.

29
00:01:10,626 --> 00:01:11,925
I know what I'm talking about.

30
00:01:11,963 --> 00:01:12,931
Well...

31
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:14,264
Back trouble?

32
00:01:14,302 --> 00:01:16,773
It's none of your concern,
Quark.

33
00:01:16,808 --> 00:01:18,779
Bad posture.

34
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,111
Will you get out of here?

35
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:22,678
What you need is
a good stretching regimen.

36
00:01:22,722 --> 00:01:25,286
Worf's morning exercise class
should be just the thing.

37
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:26,491
Forget that.

38
00:01:26,531 --> 00:01:29,368
I've got a holosuite program
that'll take care of him.

39
00:01:29,404 --> 00:01:32,275
Three Orion slave girls
strap you...

40
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:33,575
Quark...

41
00:01:33,614 --> 00:01:36,212
Go ahead... suffer.

42
00:01:36,254 --> 00:01:37,587
What do you want?

43
00:01:37,624 --> 00:01:40,825
A Yridian I've been dealing with

44
00:01:40,932 --> 00:01:43,734
sold me something
that might interest you.

45
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:45,207
I don't think so.

46
00:01:45,242 --> 00:01:46,677
You don't even know what it is.

47
00:01:46,712 --> 00:01:48,706
I know I don't want it.

48
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:50,414
In that case, can you tell me

49
00:01:50,455 --> 00:01:52,722
how to get in touch
with the Founders?

50
00:01:52,761 --> 00:01:55,028
I know they'll want it.

51
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:56,763
What are you talking about?

52
00:02:03,853 --> 00:02:06,690
It's a changeling...

53
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:09,461
or it was anyway.

54
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,935
Since it's dead

55
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,534
I'll let you have it
for five slips of latinum.

56
00:02:13,577 --> 00:02:15,046
It's not dead.

57
00:02:15,081 --> 00:02:16,641
In that case, make it ten.

58
00:02:16,684 --> 00:02:18,244
It's sick.

59
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:20,123
Eight and we'll call it even.

60
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,209
It's a pleasure
doing business with you.

61
00:02:34,093 --> 00:02:35,790
If that is a changeling

62
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,496
maybe we should get it
into a security field.

63
00:02:38,537 --> 00:02:40,268
That won't be necessary.

64
00:02:40,307 --> 00:02:41,640
But if it gets
out of that container

65
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:42,645
it could be dangerous.

66
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,414
It's not going anywhere, Doctor.

67
00:02:45,454 --> 00:02:47,789
It doesn't know how.

68
00:02:47,826 --> 00:02:50,297
It's just a baby.

69
00:04:50,947 --> 00:04:52,712
A baby changeling?

70
00:04:52,785 --> 00:04:54,653
Mmm. Centuries ago,
my people sent

71
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:56,660
a hundred of us
out into the galaxy

72
00:04:56,694 --> 00:04:58,961
so we could learn
about other races.

73
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,597
When I was found, I looked
very much like this.

74
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,439
You were this small?

75
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:04,674
Mm-hmm.

76
00:05:04,713 --> 00:05:07,207
Like a humanoid child,
it will grow.

77
00:05:07,253 --> 00:05:09,247
Its mass will increase

78
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,592
as its shape-shifting
abilities develop.

79
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,430
As far as I can tell,
it was exposed

80
00:05:13,468 --> 00:05:15,530
to a massive amount
of tetryon radiation.

81
00:05:15,572 --> 00:05:17,440
I'm going to have
to purge the isotopes

82
00:05:17,477 --> 00:05:19,037
with an electrophoretic
diffuser.

83
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:20,243
Get on it.

84
00:05:26,098 --> 00:05:29,732
Are you sure it poses
no danger to us, Constable?

85
00:05:29,773 --> 00:05:33,009
When I was first discovered,
I didn't know what I was.

86
00:05:33,048 --> 00:05:35,246
I had no memory
of where I was from.

87
00:05:35,287 --> 00:05:37,554
I didn't even know
I had the ability

88
00:05:37,592 --> 00:05:38,993
to mimic other forms.

89
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:40,498
Why would the Founders send

90
00:05:40,532 --> 00:05:42,628
such helpless creatures
out into space?

91
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:43,867
To find out if the species

92
00:05:43,907 --> 00:05:46,037
they encountered
posed any threat.

93
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,346
What better way
to gauge another race

94
00:05:48,384 --> 00:05:50,878
than to see how it treats
the weak and vulnerable.

95
00:05:50,924 --> 00:05:52,587
I see your point.

96
00:05:54,232 --> 00:05:57,638
How long before it is able
to take humanoid form?

97
00:05:57,673 --> 00:05:59,302
Several months.
Why?

98
00:05:59,345 --> 00:06:00,473
Well, there's still

99
00:06:00,513 --> 00:06:02,848
a lot we don't know
about your people.

100
00:06:02,886 --> 00:06:05,129
The changeling could
provide Starfleet

101
00:06:05,262 --> 00:06:07,529
with invaluable information
about the Dominion.

102
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,103
Well, that being the case

103
00:06:09,138 --> 00:06:11,473
I'd like to be allowed
to work with it...

104
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:13,003
to teach it how to shape-shift.

105
00:06:13,048 --> 00:06:15,542
Oh, I can't think of
anyone better qualified.

106
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,459
You might just want
a little help.

107
00:06:19,496 --> 00:06:21,490
Maybe you should
contact Dr. Mora.

108
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,673
Mora? Why?

109
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:26,976
Well, he managed to find a way
to communicate with you.

110
00:06:27,014 --> 00:06:28,483
He obviously knows
what he's doing.

111
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,822
Maybe so, but...

112
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,727
I prefer to do this alone.

113
00:06:33,764 --> 00:06:34,789
It's your call.

114
00:06:37,172 --> 00:06:40,977
But it's, uh, always nice
to have someone around

115
00:06:41,015 --> 00:06:42,575
to help change the diapers.

116
00:06:42,618 --> 00:06:45,557
I'll keep that in mind.

117
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:58,514
The purge was almost
100 percent effective.

118
00:06:58,556 --> 00:07:02,429
The concentration of isotopes
is nearly negligible.

119
00:07:02,466 --> 00:07:04,403
Well, it certainly
looks healthier.

120
00:07:04,438 --> 00:07:06,909
Well, I better go
and check on Kira.

121
00:07:06,943 --> 00:07:08,572
Did you hear?

122
00:07:08,614 --> 00:07:09,604
She's in labor.

123
00:07:09,683 --> 00:07:11,620
Mm-hmm.

124
00:07:13,993 --> 00:07:16,989
But I guess
you have your own baby

125
00:07:17,034 --> 00:07:18,834
to think about.

126
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,845
There is still a small
degree of instability

127
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,348
in its morphogenic matrix.

128
00:07:23,383 --> 00:07:25,046
I'm hoping it'll level out.

129
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:28,185
I've set the computer to monitor
for biomimetic fluctuations

130
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:29,527
just in case.

131
00:07:29,564 --> 00:07:31,158
Thank you, Doctor.

132
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,636
Good luck.

133
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:43,692
How do you feel?

134
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:45,029
Better?

135
00:07:50,714 --> 00:07:54,416
I realize you can't understand
a word I'm saying

136
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:57,158
but that doesn't matter.

137
00:07:57,197 --> 00:08:00,329
I know you're aware of me.

138
00:08:00,371 --> 00:08:04,142
You see, I was once like you.

139
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:10,156
I spent months in a lab
being prodded and poked

140
00:08:10,195 --> 00:08:12,793
by a scientist
who didn't recognize

141
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:14,771
I was a life-form.

142
00:08:18,515 --> 00:08:21,283
He thought I was a specimen...

143
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:24,955
a mystery that needed
to be unraveled.

144
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:31,268
He never talked to me.

145
00:08:32,882 --> 00:08:34,910
It didn't occur to him.

146
00:08:36,424 --> 00:08:38,657
I didn't know what I was...

147
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:42,502
or what I was supposed to do.

148
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:45,042
I was lost.

149
00:08:46,114 --> 00:08:47,310
Alone.

150
00:08:52,663 --> 00:08:55,795
But it's not going
to be that way with you.

151
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,367
No, I'm not going
to make the same mistakes

152
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:01,576
that were made with me.

153
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,428
Come on.

154
00:09:10,573 --> 00:09:13,102
I want to show you something.

155
00:09:38,038 --> 00:09:39,439
I'm sorry.

156
00:09:54,444 --> 00:09:56,175
Something's wrong.

157
00:09:56,216 --> 00:09:58,483
Kira said this would
only take about an hour.

158
00:09:59,691 --> 00:10:01,388
For Bajoran women

159
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:04,162
giving birth is
all about being relaxed.

160
00:10:04,201 --> 00:10:05,534
He's right, Miles.

161
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,633
That's why
it's so important for us

162
00:10:07,676 --> 00:10:10,079
to keep the rhythm.

163
00:10:10,115 --> 00:10:12,552
She's not going to relax
until Shakaar gets here.

164
00:10:12,588 --> 00:10:16,188
I called him
almost six hours ago.

165
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,930
Only takes half that time
to make the trip from Bajor.

166
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,462
He's the First Minister
of Bajor...

167
00:10:20,507 --> 00:10:21,497
he's a very busy man.

168
00:10:21,543 --> 00:10:23,035
And so am I.

169
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:25,550
I have three surgeries
scheduled this afternoon.

170
00:10:25,586 --> 00:10:28,354
I'll try and pop by later.

171
00:10:38,115 --> 00:10:40,450
Y'Pora

172
00:10:40,488 --> 00:10:42,253
the baby is moving.

173
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:44,286
Relax.

174
00:10:44,331 --> 00:10:45,960
Breathe.

175
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:47,904
It won't be long now.

176
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,376
Sorry I'm late.

177
00:10:50,412 --> 00:10:51,437
How are you?

178
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:52,950
All right.

179
00:10:57,228 --> 00:10:58,663
I threw you off, didn't I?

180
00:10:58,698 --> 00:11:00,635
It's all right.
I'll get back on track.

181
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,798
I'm glad you're here.

182
00:11:06,384 --> 00:11:08,184
This is the Replimat.

183
00:11:08,222 --> 00:11:10,352
Humanoids come here to eat.

184
00:11:10,394 --> 00:11:12,091
They...

185
00:11:12,131 --> 00:11:16,437
we, rather, need
to ingest nutrients.

186
00:11:16,474 --> 00:11:18,000
This is my home.

187
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:19,843
It's a space station.

188
00:11:19,883 --> 00:11:23,688
People of many different
species live here together.

189
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:27,029
After you've learned
to take humanoid shape

190
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,296
I'll show you everything.

191
00:11:28,337 --> 00:11:30,866
You can live here, too,
if you want.

192
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:32,743
It's a fascinating place.

193
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,719
Constable, why are you talking
to your beverage?

194
00:11:37,191 --> 00:11:38,751
It's not a beverage.

195
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,601
It's a changeling.

196
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,938
Excuse me, Commander.

197
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,097
There we go, huh?

198
00:11:57,172 --> 00:11:59,666
Now, doesn't that feel better?

199
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:01,705
Nothing like spreading
yourself out

200
00:12:01,749 --> 00:12:03,811
after being cooped up
in a jar, huh?

201
00:12:06,795 --> 00:12:11,796
You have no idea of the marvels
that are in store for you.

202
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,741
Do you know what you are?

203
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:16,877
You're a changeling...

204
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,258
a shape-shifter.

205
00:12:20,294 --> 00:12:22,458
You can be anything...

206
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:26,635
a Tarkalean hawk
soaring through the sky

207
00:12:26,676 --> 00:12:31,484
or a Filian python burrowing
deep beneath the ground.

208
00:12:31,521 --> 00:12:33,822
It's all yours for the taking.

209
00:12:37,803 --> 00:12:43,875
I was never
a very good shape-shifter.

210
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:45,785
If you could see
the face I'm stuck with

211
00:12:45,822 --> 00:12:47,189
you'd know what I mean.

212
00:12:49,397 --> 00:12:52,564
But I think I can be
a good teacher.

213
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,478
You'll be better
than I ever was.

214
00:12:56,514 --> 00:13:00,957
And I promise I'll never treat
you the way I was treated.

215
00:13:00,991 --> 00:13:02,324
Never.

216
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,231
Odo!

217
00:13:06,271 --> 00:13:08,674
Dr. Mora.

218
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,512
What are you doing here?

219
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,042
Well, I heard
about the changeling.

220
00:13:14,524 --> 00:13:16,255
I came to help.

221
00:13:22,294 --> 00:13:23,991
Remarkable.

222
00:13:24,031 --> 00:13:27,494
You know, i-i-it's
much larger than you were.

223
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,670
What is that...
about a quarter of a liter?

224
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:31,374
I suppose so.

225
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,045
You didn't measure it?

226
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:36,390
What difference does
it make how large it is?

227
00:13:36,428 --> 00:13:39,664
It could make a great
deal of difference.

228
00:13:39,702 --> 00:13:42,368
Size could be
an indication that it's

229
00:13:42,409 --> 00:13:45,177
already exercised
its ability to shape-shift.

230
00:13:47,354 --> 00:13:51,159
I thought you were on Earth
working with Starfleet

231
00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:54,396
on new ways to detect
changeling infiltrators.

232
00:13:54,438 --> 00:13:58,140
Mmm. Fortunately, I was visiting
my parents on Bajor

233
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,549
when I got the news
of your find.

234
00:14:00,585 --> 00:14:02,613
How are you, Odo?

235
00:14:02,657 --> 00:14:04,126
I've been worried.

236
00:14:04,228 --> 00:14:05,629
Worried?

237
00:14:05,665 --> 00:14:06,895
I heard that your people

238
00:14:06,934 --> 00:14:08,837
took away your ability
to shape-shift.

239
00:14:08,872 --> 00:14:12,608
Thank you for your
concern, but I'm fine.

240
00:14:12,648 --> 00:14:14,413
I knew you were going
to say that.

241
00:14:14,452 --> 00:14:16,650
You never want
to give anything away

242
00:14:16,691 --> 00:14:19,823
even though it's all
right there in your face.

243
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:25,940
Well, let's get started, hmm?

244
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,609
We have a lot of work
ahead of us.

245
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:28,846
Actually, Doctor...

246
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:30,322
I told Starfleet
I wouldn't be coming back

247
00:14:30,357 --> 00:14:31,325
for a couple of weeks.

248
00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:32,487
That may have been premature.

249
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:34,089
No, it'll take
at least that long

250
00:14:34,132 --> 00:14:36,160
to get the changeling
to respond.

251
00:14:36,204 --> 00:14:37,901
Don't do that!

252
00:14:41,316 --> 00:14:43,013
Well, I see you
still have trouble

253
00:14:43,054 --> 00:14:44,318
controlling your temper.

254
00:14:44,357 --> 00:14:47,763
I was just trying
to determine its mass.

255
00:14:47,798 --> 00:14:50,430
Dr. Mora, I understand
that you want to help

256
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,536
but I'm going to do this alone.

257
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,710
Alone?

258
00:14:55,752 --> 00:14:57,723
Odo, you don't know
the first thing

259
00:14:57,756 --> 00:15:00,354
about teaching a changeling
how to shape-shift.

260
00:15:00,395 --> 00:15:03,699
Well, then, I'll just
muddle through somehow.

261
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,571
You did.

262
00:15:14,897 --> 00:15:17,027
It's too warm in here.

263
00:15:17,068 --> 00:15:18,435
You know, a changeling's

264
00:15:18,472 --> 00:15:20,841
morphogenic matrix
is most malleable

265
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,111
at 17 degrees Celsius.

266
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,449
I used to be able
to change shape

267
00:15:24,487 --> 00:15:26,081
in almost any temperature.

268
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:32,265
That's true, but why not
make it easy for the changeling?

269
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:37,182
It took me weeks to figure out
the optimal temperature

270
00:15:37,218 --> 00:15:40,282
the humidity,
even the light levels.

271
00:15:40,325 --> 00:15:43,457
Now, don't you think that's
information you could use?

272
00:15:45,437 --> 00:15:46,963
Well, I...

273
00:15:47,007 --> 00:15:49,605
suppose I could look
at your reports.

274
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:51,481
Oh, well, feel free
to, of course...

275
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:53,955
except I was never one
to keep extensive records.

276
00:15:53,991 --> 00:15:56,224
I always wanted to move
on to the next test.

277
00:15:56,263 --> 00:16:00,034
Oh, believe me,
I remember your tests

278
00:16:00,072 --> 00:16:01,268
very well.

279
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:03,370
Oh.

280
00:16:03,413 --> 00:16:05,782
So that's what this is about.

281
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:08,724
You still resent
the things I did to you

282
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,289
in order to induce you
to shape-shift.

283
00:16:11,332 --> 00:16:13,428
Well, I know they weren't
pleasant for you

284
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,600
but really, Odo, I would hope

285
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:18,136
that you would get
past that by now.

286
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:20,050
I am disappointed.

287
00:16:20,087 --> 00:16:22,285
I have my own ideas

288
00:16:22,326 --> 00:16:24,422
about how to teach
the changeling.

289
00:16:24,464 --> 00:16:26,058
I imagine they're less invasive.

290
00:16:26,101 --> 00:16:27,069
Exactly.

291
00:16:27,103 --> 00:16:28,333
Hmm.

292
00:16:28,373 --> 00:16:30,469
You don't think
that I can do it, do you?

293
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:31,570
I didn't say that.

294
00:16:31,614 --> 00:16:32,913
As a matter of fact

295
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,186
I'd be fascinated to see
what you have in mind.

296
00:16:36,225 --> 00:16:39,461
Well, in that case, why don't
you stay... and observe?

297
00:16:41,537 --> 00:16:43,006
If you insist.

298
00:16:52,598 --> 00:16:53,726
What's wrong?

299
00:16:53,768 --> 00:16:55,169
I... I don't know.

300
00:16:55,204 --> 00:16:57,402
It was like a cramp
or something.

301
00:16:57,443 --> 00:16:59,174
You shouldn't
be feeling any pain.

302
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,181
Well... it appears
you're not going

303
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:05,353
to be having the baby today.

304
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:06,192
What?!

305
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,722
You were in labor too long.

306
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:10,799
I wonder why.

307
00:17:10,841 --> 00:17:12,812
For whatever reason

308
00:17:12,846 --> 00:17:14,543
you weren't able to fully relax.

309
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:16,953
Your system had to stop
producing endorphins

310
00:17:16,989 --> 00:17:19,791
before they accumulated
to toxic levels.

311
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,265
When will she have the baby?

312
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,068
It could be a few more days...

313
00:17:24,107 --> 00:17:25,907
or a few more weeks.

314
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,414
Weeks?

315
00:17:27,482 --> 00:17:29,419
Oh, if I don't have
this baby soon,

316
00:17:29,487 --> 00:17:31,252
I'm going to go out of my mind.

317
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:35,129
Well, if you want, you can go
see Dr. Bashir and have him...

318
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,601
No, no, I...

319
00:17:36,637 --> 00:17:40,408
I want to have this baby
the traditional Bajoran way.

320
00:17:40,446 --> 00:17:43,112
We're a hundred percent
behind you, Nerys.

321
00:17:43,153 --> 00:17:44,452
Right, Miles?

322
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:46,551
Absolutely.

323
00:17:47,663 --> 00:17:48,996
Can you stay?

324
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:51,870
I'll have to rearrange
my schedule

325
00:17:51,907 --> 00:17:53,274
but I think so.

326
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:56,044
Nerys, return to your quarters
and rest.

327
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,350
I'll come by and see you later.

328
00:17:58,389 --> 00:18:00,292
You.

329
00:18:00,327 --> 00:18:04,895
Be punctual next time
or don't come at all.

330
00:18:06,709 --> 00:18:08,076
And you?

331
00:18:08,112 --> 00:18:09,137
Practice.

332
00:18:15,697 --> 00:18:19,297
This... is a sphere.

333
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:23,338
It's one of the most basic forms
in nature.

334
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,848
See how it rolls?

335
00:18:32,303 --> 00:18:35,470
Interesting, isn't it?

336
00:18:35,511 --> 00:18:37,675
You're in my light.

337
00:18:42,428 --> 00:18:44,422
Now...

338
00:18:45,735 --> 00:18:48,104
this won't hurt a bit.

339
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:50,439
Here we are.

340
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,949
Here we go.

341
00:18:51,984 --> 00:18:55,652
Yeah. Yeah.

342
00:18:55,693 --> 00:18:57,128
Yeah-yeah.

343
00:18:57,163 --> 00:18:59,396
Now...

344
00:18:59,435 --> 00:19:02,272
this is also a sphere.

345
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,110
Huh?

346
00:19:05,148 --> 00:19:08,212
Feel... its symmetry

347
00:19:08,256 --> 00:19:10,523
the softness of its shape?

348
00:19:10,562 --> 00:19:12,533
The sameness, huh?

349
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,468
Now...

350
00:19:14,504 --> 00:19:15,529
you try.

351
00:19:23,927 --> 00:19:26,057
Ah...

352
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:28,093
There we are.

353
00:19:30,777 --> 00:19:32,941
I understand

354
00:19:32,982 --> 00:19:35,078
that you prefer
to remain shapeless.

355
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,526
Believe me, I remember
how relaxing it could be.

356
00:19:38,562 --> 00:19:42,902
But you have to learn
to take other forms.

357
00:19:42,939 --> 00:19:44,807
That's what changelings do.

358
00:19:44,844 --> 00:19:46,974
It can be immensely rewarding.

359
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:51,790
I remember the first time
Dr. Mora here coerced me

360
00:19:51,828 --> 00:19:53,958
into taking the shape
of a cube

361
00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:57,063
with one of his electrostatic
gadgets.

362
00:19:57,106 --> 00:20:00,273
Once I did it, and he turned
the infernal thing off

363
00:20:00,314 --> 00:20:03,914
I was perfectly content
to stay a cube for hours.

364
00:20:03,956 --> 00:20:07,294
It was fascinating...
all those right angles.

365
00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:11,305
Of course, he had other plans.

366
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:12,640
Before I knew it

367
00:20:12,677 --> 00:20:16,209
he had me spinning
around in a centrifuge.

368
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,854
Well...

369
00:20:20,897 --> 00:20:24,862
if you're not interested
in a sphere right now

370
00:20:24,907 --> 00:20:27,174
we can always try...

371
00:20:27,212 --> 00:20:27,934
a cube.

372
00:20:28,067 --> 00:20:30,504
What do you think?

373
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,479
All right. Now...

374
00:20:33,514 --> 00:20:36,214
this is a pyramid.

375
00:20:36,321 --> 00:20:40,787
It's one of the most
mysterious shapes in nature.

376
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,554
What are you doing?

377
00:21:20,126 --> 00:21:22,290
I'm measuring its volume.

378
00:21:24,369 --> 00:21:27,935
It's been here a week,
and it's only grown 17 percent.

379
00:21:27,978 --> 00:21:30,951
After three days in my lab,
you were twice that size.

380
00:21:30,985 --> 00:21:33,583
Well, maybe I was
anxious to grow up

381
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,823
so I could get out of there.

382
00:21:35,863 --> 00:21:38,198
My point is,
you've made no progress.

383
00:21:38,235 --> 00:21:40,638
By this time,
I'd already gotten you

384
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:42,976
to mimic half a dozen
simple forms.

385
00:21:43,014 --> 00:21:45,212
I am trying to gain
its confidence

386
00:21:45,252 --> 00:21:46,448
not teach it tricks.

387
00:21:46,489 --> 00:21:48,983
It's a shame
you're not a changeling anymore.

388
00:21:49,028 --> 00:21:50,463
You could link with it

389
00:21:50,498 --> 00:21:52,799
and teach it everything
it needs to know.

390
00:21:52,837 --> 00:21:56,141
You make it sound
like it's my fault.

391
00:21:56,178 --> 00:21:57,477
It might very well be.

392
00:21:57,515 --> 00:21:58,677
Let's face it, Odo.

393
00:21:58,718 --> 00:22:01,121
Your shape-shifting ability
was somewhat limited.

394
00:22:01,157 --> 00:22:03,994
Maybe that's why your people
were able to force you

395
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,761
to take a humanoid form.

396
00:22:05,802 --> 00:22:07,670
That is pure speculation.

397
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:09,506
Let's run a few tests
and find out.

398
00:22:09,544 --> 00:22:11,275
Oh! You are just dying to get me

399
00:22:11,315 --> 00:22:13,445
into one of your contraptions,
aren't you?

400
00:22:13,487 --> 00:22:14,477
I'm trying to help.

401
00:22:14,522 --> 00:22:16,287
I am not about to submit myself

402
00:22:16,327 --> 00:22:18,491
to another round
of your experiments.

403
00:22:18,532 --> 00:22:21,904
Everything I did to you
was for your own good.

404
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,102
Ha!

405
00:22:23,143 --> 00:22:26,584
True, some of the tests
that I subjected you to

406
00:22:26,618 --> 00:22:28,953
proved inconclusive.

407
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:31,895
The vacuum chamber
springs to mind.

408
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,094
The cytoplasmic separator...

409
00:22:34,136 --> 00:22:37,542
Come to think of it,
the protein decompiler as well.

410
00:22:37,577 --> 00:22:39,980
How could I know
until I tried?

411
00:22:40,017 --> 00:22:41,179
By the Prophets, Odo

412
00:22:41,219 --> 00:22:44,386
I wasn't even sure
you were a life-form.

413
00:22:44,428 --> 00:22:46,193
I wasn't sure about you either.

414
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:48,361
Once I realized
you were sentient

415
00:22:48,403 --> 00:22:50,397
oh, the Cardassians
wanted to know

416
00:22:50,442 --> 00:22:51,741
everything about you.

417
00:22:51,778 --> 00:22:53,908
I was under enormous pressure

418
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:57,413
to come up with results,
and I did.

419
00:22:57,525 --> 00:22:59,256
My technique worked.

420
00:22:59,297 --> 00:23:02,567
The fact that you are standing
here, whining about it

421
00:23:02,604 --> 00:23:03,766
proves it.

422
00:23:03,807 --> 00:23:06,108
You enjoyed watching me suffer.

423
00:23:06,146 --> 00:23:07,740
You really believe that?

424
00:23:07,783 --> 00:23:09,811
How pathetic.

425
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,051
If it wasn't for me

426
00:23:11,091 --> 00:23:13,585
you'd still be sitting
on a shelf somewhere

427
00:23:13,631 --> 00:23:16,331
in a beaker labeled
"unknown sample."

428
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:19,002
If it wasn't for me,
you'd be a nobody.

429
00:23:19,043 --> 00:23:22,141
Starfleet wouldn't hire you
to judge a science fair.

430
00:23:22,185 --> 00:23:24,383
I'm getting a little tired
of sitting around watching you

431
00:23:24,424 --> 00:23:26,622
but I can't seem
to pull myself away.

432
00:23:26,662 --> 00:23:29,726
I can't wait to see what
next preposterous thing

433
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:31,637
you're going to try.

434
00:23:31,674 --> 00:23:34,203
Who knows?
Maybe in a couple of months

435
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,652
it may get so tired
of your incessant chatter

436
00:23:37,688 --> 00:23:39,659
that it might
actually do something.

437
00:23:39,693 --> 00:23:41,960
Oh, you'd just love
to get your hands on it

438
00:23:41,998 --> 00:23:42,966
wouldn't you?

439
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:44,904
You could sell tickets
on the Promenade.

440
00:23:44,939 --> 00:23:48,402
"Dr. Mora's Chamber of Horrors...
open for business.

441
00:23:48,447 --> 00:23:49,939
Right this way!"

442
00:23:50,954 --> 00:23:51,922
Captain.

443
00:23:51,956 --> 00:23:54,325
How's it going, gentlemen?

444
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,266
Making progress, sir.

445
00:23:59,307 --> 00:24:02,144
I'm glad to hear it.

446
00:24:02,181 --> 00:24:05,052
I was just talking
with Starfleet Command.

447
00:24:05,088 --> 00:24:06,751
They want you
to establish communication

448
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:09,285
with the changeling as soon
as possible.

449
00:24:09,331 --> 00:24:13,136
At the rate we're going,
that is still a long way off.

450
00:24:13,173 --> 00:24:14,699
Better not be too long.

451
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,612
Otherwise,
Starfleet is going to want

452
00:24:16,649 --> 00:24:17,982
to take over the project.

453
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:19,283
Sir...

454
00:24:19,321 --> 00:24:20,950
As long as you're
making progress

455
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,361
there's nothing to worry about.

456
00:24:25,202 --> 00:24:27,105
Oh, by the way...

457
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,603
Starfleet wants you to file
daily reports for their review.

458
00:24:30,648 --> 00:24:33,485
Understood, sir.

459
00:24:33,522 --> 00:24:36,620
Carry on.

460
00:24:47,255 --> 00:24:49,989
Now you understand
the kind of pressure

461
00:24:50,028 --> 00:24:52,261
I was going through.

462
00:24:54,773 --> 00:24:57,575
I brought my old equipment
from Bajor.

463
00:24:57,613 --> 00:25:00,643
Maybe it's time
we started unpacking.

464
00:25:18,596 --> 00:25:20,863
Anytime you're ready.

465
00:25:34,635 --> 00:25:36,036
Don't worry.

466
00:25:36,072 --> 00:25:38,305
You're going to get
through this all right.

467
00:25:41,886 --> 00:25:43,549
Oh, no... no, no.

468
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,891
I'm just an observer here.

469
00:26:02,402 --> 00:26:05,204
Odo, the changeling
won't respond

470
00:26:05,242 --> 00:26:07,713
to anything less
than six millivolts.

471
00:26:09,418 --> 00:26:11,855
There must be some other way.

472
00:26:13,662 --> 00:26:16,294
Spare the rod, spoil the child.

473
00:26:16,335 --> 00:26:18,738
Odo, without discomfort

474
00:26:18,774 --> 00:26:21,975
the changeling will be
perfectly comfortable

475
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:24,486
to remain
in its gelatinous state.

476
00:26:24,522 --> 00:26:25,957
It'll just lie there...

477
00:26:25,992 --> 00:26:30,435
never realizing it has the
ability to mimic other forms...

478
00:26:30,469 --> 00:26:32,906
never living up
to its potential.

479
00:26:32,941 --> 00:26:35,505
Odo, six millivolts
is not going to hurt it.

480
00:26:35,548 --> 00:26:38,350
Once it realizes there's
no charge in the center

481
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,484
the procedure will be finished.

482
00:26:55,696 --> 00:26:58,692
Checking to see
if I'm enjoying myself?

483
00:27:04,785 --> 00:27:05,775
That's it.

484
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,255
You've found it.

485
00:27:09,262 --> 00:27:12,634
I smiled the first time
you did that.

486
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:17,671
Little did I realize you would
end up hating me for it.

487
00:27:19,286 --> 00:27:20,949
Well, shall we move on?

488
00:27:22,494 --> 00:27:23,484
Why not?

489
00:27:36,136 --> 00:27:38,130
Edon.

490
00:27:42,718 --> 00:27:44,119
How you feeling?

491
00:27:44,155 --> 00:27:45,123
I'm all right.

492
00:27:45,157 --> 00:27:46,922
My feet are a little swollen.

493
00:27:46,962 --> 00:27:47,987
A little?

494
00:27:48,031 --> 00:27:49,728
They've never been this bad.

495
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:52,172
Well, there's a zero-grav
tumbling performance

496
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:53,575
on the Promenade tonight.

497
00:27:53,644 --> 00:27:54,806
Do you want to go?

498
00:27:54,848 --> 00:27:56,112
Well, maybe.

499
00:27:56,151 --> 00:27:58,588
You can't go standing around
for an hour.

500
00:27:58,656 --> 00:28:02,290
Chief, would you mind
leaving us alone for a minute?

501
00:28:02,332 --> 00:28:04,097
I'm almost done.

502
00:28:04,136 --> 00:28:05,799
Well, I'll take over.

503
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,674
I think it's time.

504
00:28:07,712 --> 00:28:09,306
You got to do it harder.

505
00:28:09,349 --> 00:28:10,511
I know what I'm doing.

506
00:28:10,552 --> 00:28:12,420
- It's time.
- And you got to work

507
00:28:12,456 --> 00:28:13,287
up the legs.

508
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:14,817
It's time!

509
00:28:26,189 --> 00:28:29,755
Now, if I were you,
I'd hold this shape.

510
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:32,930
Otherwise, you'll be
in for a little shock.

511
00:28:35,912 --> 00:28:37,074
Ah.

512
00:28:42,394 --> 00:28:43,988
Wait a minute.

513
00:28:47,975 --> 00:28:51,507
I had to try that three times
before you caught on.

514
00:28:53,288 --> 00:28:55,384
Actually, the first two times

515
00:28:55,426 --> 00:28:57,897
I didn't hold my shape
on purpose.

516
00:28:59,235 --> 00:29:00,864
You're not serious.

517
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:05,473
I suppose I didn't want
to give you the satisfaction.

518
00:29:09,126 --> 00:29:11,860
Well, someday,
if you're very lucky...

519
00:29:13,636 --> 00:29:15,230
this changeling...

520
00:29:15,273 --> 00:29:17,802
will give you
the satisfaction of saying

521
00:29:17,846 --> 00:29:19,338
"Thank you very much.

522
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:21,581
You did so much for me."

523
00:29:22,925 --> 00:29:25,260
Then again...

524
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:26,766
it may leave...

525
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,599
the way you did.

526
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:31,076
It will announce

527
00:29:31,111 --> 00:29:32,979
that it's striking out
on its own

528
00:29:33,016 --> 00:29:35,078
and you will never...

529
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:36,647
hear from it again.

530
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,401
I'm going to get something
to eat.

531
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:26,032
Oh...

532
00:30:31,356 --> 00:30:33,156
- I mean, the eyes...
- When he rose up...

533
00:30:33,193 --> 00:30:35,164
...the eyes are incredible.
...for a minute there

534
00:30:35,198 --> 00:30:36,667
I thought he was going
to say something.

535
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:39,173
Oh, put that down.
We're celebrating.

536
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:41,270
Oh, uh, it's just that
I've fallen behind

537
00:30:41,313 --> 00:30:43,614
in my security reports
over these last few days.

538
00:30:43,652 --> 00:30:45,053
Well, you can catch up later.

539
00:30:45,089 --> 00:30:46,752
Aren't you excited
by what happened?

540
00:30:46,792 --> 00:30:48,159
Of course, I'm excited.

541
00:30:48,196 --> 00:30:50,998
You know, tomorrow, we
can expose the changeling

542
00:30:51,036 --> 00:30:52,870
to some simple life-forms

543
00:30:52,941 --> 00:30:56,005
so it can mimic them...
some algae, some fungus.

544
00:30:56,048 --> 00:30:58,246
In a few more days,
maybe even an invertebrate.

545
00:30:58,287 --> 00:31:01,728
I can't wait until I can
actually communicate with it.

546
00:31:01,762 --> 00:31:03,493
There's so much
I want it to see

547
00:31:03,533 --> 00:31:04,968
so much I want to share.

548
00:31:05,003 --> 00:31:07,440
Well, you may get that chance
sooner than you think.

549
00:31:07,475 --> 00:31:10,039
The changeling is developing
far faster than you did.

550
00:31:11,485 --> 00:31:13,285
I-I-I don't mean that
as a criticism.

551
00:31:13,323 --> 00:31:14,849
If anything, it's a compliment.

552
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,623
I mean, I was wrong.

553
00:31:16,664 --> 00:31:20,469
Your approach to communicating
to the changeling was sound.

554
00:31:20,506 --> 00:31:21,805
I mean, don't you see?

555
00:31:21,843 --> 00:31:23,369
It's reaching out to you.

556
00:31:23,413 --> 00:31:25,680
It's curious about you.

557
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,714
The first time
you ever did anything

558
00:31:27,757 --> 00:31:30,160
like that was when you
formed a tentacle

559
00:31:30,197 --> 00:31:32,566
to slap my hand
away from the control panel.

560
00:31:32,602 --> 00:31:33,661
I remember.

561
00:31:33,705 --> 00:31:37,168
I wanted you to stop zapping me.

562
00:31:40,454 --> 00:31:44,088
You formed a connection
with this changeling.

563
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:48,232
That is something I was
never able to do with you.

564
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:49,742
That's not true.

565
00:31:51,347 --> 00:31:53,112
I respected you.

566
00:31:53,152 --> 00:31:55,180
You feared me.

567
00:31:55,223 --> 00:31:57,194
You didn't know what I was.

568
00:31:57,228 --> 00:31:58,925
You were experimenting

569
00:31:58,965 --> 00:32:01,904
on what looked like
a lump of organic residue.

570
00:32:01,972 --> 00:32:05,104
That's what I'd still be
if it weren't for you.

571
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:10,923
You don't know
how much it means to me

572
00:32:10,994 --> 00:32:12,657
to hear you say that.

573
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,438
I'm sorry.

574
00:32:15,472 --> 00:32:18,878
I know this kind of talk
makes you uncomfortable.

575
00:32:18,913 --> 00:32:20,678
But I suppose it's all my fault.

576
00:32:20,718 --> 00:32:22,951
If I hadn't poked
and prodded you so much

577
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:25,656
you may have grown up with
a less forbidding disposition.

578
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,234
Well, something tells me

579
00:32:29,271 --> 00:32:32,244
no matter what we do
to that changeling

580
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:35,981
it's going to have a more
pleasant disposition than mine.

581
00:32:36,021 --> 00:32:38,083
It's just the way I am.

582
00:32:40,431 --> 00:32:42,402
Well...

583
00:32:42,436 --> 00:32:43,700
I'll leave you to your work.

584
00:32:45,845 --> 00:32:47,212
Dr. Mora?

585
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,836
Two glasses of champagne,
please.

586
00:32:58,074 --> 00:32:59,600
We're celebrating.

587
00:33:27,478 --> 00:33:28,947
The baby has turned.

588
00:33:28,981 --> 00:33:30,678
It's time.

589
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,993
Awake, child.

590
00:33:37,034 --> 00:33:38,937
We await you with love.

591
00:33:38,972 --> 00:33:41,170
And welcome you into the world.

592
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:42,804
Why don't you stay there?

593
00:33:42,847 --> 00:33:44,077
I can't see from here.

594
00:33:44,117 --> 00:33:44,914
Exactly.

595
00:33:44,952 --> 00:33:46,216
It's my baby.

596
00:33:46,256 --> 00:33:48,090
Shh.

597
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:49,528
I think it would make
Nerys uncomfortable.

598
00:33:49,564 --> 00:33:50,726
What are you talking about?

599
00:33:50,766 --> 00:33:52,669
She's been living in my home
for the last five months.

600
00:33:52,705 --> 00:33:53,867
Be quiet.

601
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:54,876
What's that supposed to mean?

602
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,379
Look, I missed Molly's birth.

603
00:33:56,413 --> 00:33:57,848
I am not going to miss this one.

604
00:33:57,883 --> 00:33:59,546
I'm trying to have a baby.

605
00:33:59,588 --> 00:34:02,186
I am sick

606
00:34:02,227 --> 00:34:05,064
of this ridiculous
little competition

607
00:34:05,134 --> 00:34:06,968
between the two of you.

608
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:09,910
Now, if one of you
says one more word

609
00:34:09,946 --> 00:34:12,383
you're going to have to leave.

610
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:14,788
- Fine, just tell him to...
- Just tell him to...

611
00:34:14,824 --> 00:34:16,418
All right, that's it.
Out, both of you.

612
00:34:16,461 --> 00:34:17,794
- Kira...
- Nerys...

613
00:34:17,831 --> 00:34:19,596
Go.

614
00:34:19,636 --> 00:34:20,969
You're joking.

615
00:34:21,006 --> 00:34:23,911
Does it look like she's joking?

616
00:34:23,946 --> 00:34:25,005
Out.

617
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:33,294
Nice going.

618
00:34:33,335 --> 00:34:34,804
Oh, do me a favor.

619
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:36,776
Next time you have a baby

620
00:34:36,811 --> 00:34:39,146
leave my girlfriend
out of it, huh?

621
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:47,802
Comes to...

622
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:50,675
three hundred and twenty-four.

623
00:34:50,712 --> 00:34:54,153
I'm going to have to start
watering the drinks again.

624
00:34:56,192 --> 00:34:57,525
Constable?

625
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,429
Quark!

626
00:35:00,469 --> 00:35:02,132
What are you doing back there?

627
00:35:02,172 --> 00:35:03,607
What does it look
like I'm doing?

628
00:35:03,642 --> 00:35:04,770
We're closed.

629
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:06,042
Have a seat.

630
00:35:06,082 --> 00:35:08,246
You're in a good mood.

631
00:35:08,287 --> 00:35:09,916
Yes, I am.

632
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:13,125
Which means you're probably
about to arrest me

633
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:15,034
on some trumped-up charge.

634
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,132
Not at all.

635
00:35:17,175 --> 00:35:19,646
I am buying you a drink.

636
00:35:25,227 --> 00:35:26,423
Why?

637
00:35:26,464 --> 00:35:30,030
Dr. Mora has gone to sleep,
and I...

638
00:35:30,072 --> 00:35:33,102
still feel like celebrating.

639
00:35:33,147 --> 00:35:34,548
What are you up to?

640
00:35:34,584 --> 00:35:36,748
I am happy, Quark.

641
00:35:36,789 --> 00:35:38,258
Can't you just accept that?

642
00:35:38,293 --> 00:35:39,318
No.

643
00:35:39,361 --> 00:35:40,386
It doesn't fit.

644
00:35:40,431 --> 00:35:41,399
If you're happy

645
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:43,233
there's something
very wrong in the world.

646
00:35:43,271 --> 00:35:45,903
The center cannot hold.

647
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:47,480
There we go.

648
00:35:48,484 --> 00:35:49,817
I've got it.

649
00:35:49,854 --> 00:35:51,153
You're getting back at me

650
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,127
for selling you
that sick changeling.

651
00:35:53,162 --> 00:35:56,067
Actually, I should thank you.

652
00:35:56,102 --> 00:35:58,700
If you want the money back,
just say so.

653
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:00,939
It changed my life.

654
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,745
Here's to you, Quark.

655
00:36:05,023 --> 00:36:06,857
All right, all right,
I confess.

656
00:36:06,895 --> 00:36:09,629
I don't know what I did,
but I did it.

657
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,935
Just stop.
I can't take it anymore.

658
00:36:13,844 --> 00:36:16,408
Do you ever think
about having children?

659
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,885
Huh?

660
00:36:17,921 --> 00:36:19,584
See, I never did.

661
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:21,892
It just seemed like
too much trouble

662
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:24,232
but then fate...

663
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:26,331
dropped one into my lap...

664
00:36:26,374 --> 00:36:28,071
and I couldn't be happier.

665
00:36:29,315 --> 00:36:30,283
Cheers.

666
00:36:32,455 --> 00:36:33,924
Strange.

667
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,863
Over the past few months,
I came to accept the fact

668
00:36:35,897 --> 00:36:37,925
that I'd never have any contact
with my people again.

669
00:36:37,969 --> 00:36:39,461
They rejected me.

670
00:36:39,505 --> 00:36:42,672
They turned me
into a humanoid and...

671
00:36:42,714 --> 00:36:44,912
part of me was lost forever.

672
00:36:50,432 --> 00:36:52,494
But that...

673
00:36:52,537 --> 00:36:56,741
little ball of goo
back in the lab

674
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,717
changed everything.

675
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:02,623
I feel as if I'm...

676
00:37:02,662 --> 00:37:05,396
experiencing what it is...

677
00:37:05,435 --> 00:37:07,929
to be a changeling again.

678
00:37:09,344 --> 00:37:10,973
And somehow...

679
00:37:11,048 --> 00:37:15,684
being a solid
doesn't seem so bad anymore.

680
00:37:20,103 --> 00:37:22,006
Fill me up.

681
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:25,311
Computer to Security Chief Odo,
please acknowledge.

682
00:37:25,348 --> 00:37:26,442
Go ahead.

683
00:37:26,485 --> 00:37:29,014
The life-form being monitored
is displaying

684
00:37:29,058 --> 00:37:31,656
biomimetic fluctuations
beyond stated parameters.

685
00:37:31,697 --> 00:37:34,636
Have Dr. Mora meet me
in the Science Lab.

686
00:37:34,671 --> 00:37:35,765
Acknowledged.

687
00:37:40,218 --> 00:37:41,243
What's happened?

688
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,791
Its morphogenic matrix
is destabilizing.

689
00:37:48,137 --> 00:37:50,165
It's dying.

690
00:37:59,631 --> 00:38:00,964
Its life signs are fading.

691
00:38:01,001 --> 00:38:02,904
The radiation must have
damaged its cytoplasm

692
00:38:02,939 --> 00:38:04,408
in a way we weren't
able to detect.

693
00:38:04,442 --> 00:38:06,036
There must be something
you can do.

694
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,141
You might try
an enzymatic induction.

695
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:10,953
That might stabilize
the biomimetic fluctuations.

696
00:38:10,991 --> 00:38:11,959
It's worth a shot.

697
00:38:11,994 --> 00:38:13,361
It has to work.
It has to...

698
00:38:13,398 --> 00:38:14,924
Odo, please, wait outside.

699
00:38:14,968 --> 00:38:16,597
We'll do everything we can.

700
00:38:22,352 --> 00:38:24,152
I feel...

701
00:38:25,861 --> 00:38:27,387
so good.

702
00:38:27,431 --> 00:38:29,527
You're doing great, Nerys.

703
00:38:37,789 --> 00:38:39,953
Here he comes.

704
00:38:39,995 --> 00:38:42,466
Keiko...

705
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,129
would you do me a favor?

706
00:38:47,045 --> 00:38:49,482
Kira said you can
both come back in

707
00:38:49,517 --> 00:38:51,750
if you promise to behave.

708
00:38:53,928 --> 00:38:54,918
Oh, after you.

709
00:38:54,964 --> 00:38:56,160
Oh, no. After you.

710
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:57,167
Please...

711
00:38:57,202 --> 00:38:58,170
Will you two get in here?

712
00:38:58,238 --> 00:38:59,707
You're going to miss everything.

713
00:39:07,593 --> 00:39:09,564
That's it, Nerys.

714
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:11,124
Relax.

715
00:39:11,235 --> 00:39:13,206
Let it come.

716
00:39:14,243 --> 00:39:15,906
That's right.
Breathe.

717
00:39:38,034 --> 00:39:39,697
Oh.

718
00:39:39,737 --> 00:39:41,935
Look at him, Miles.

719
00:39:41,976 --> 00:39:43,707
He's beautiful.

720
00:39:54,339 --> 00:39:56,640
There's nothing we could do.

721
00:39:56,678 --> 00:39:58,375
I'm sorry, Odo.

722
00:39:58,415 --> 00:40:00,852
It won't be very long now.

723
00:40:28,688 --> 00:40:30,659
Please...

724
00:40:30,693 --> 00:40:32,493
don't die.

725
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:34,764
There's so much
I want to show you.

726
00:40:34,802 --> 00:40:39,108
I was going to teach you
how to be a Tarkalean hawk

727
00:40:39,146 --> 00:40:40,136
remember?

728
00:40:46,898 --> 00:40:48,367
What happened?
Where did it go?

729
00:40:48,402 --> 00:40:50,896
It somehow integrated itself
into Odo's body.

730
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,376
Odo, what's wrong?

731
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:57,116
It can't be!

732
00:40:57,157 --> 00:40:58,056
What?

733
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:51,725
This, uh, might be a good time

734
00:41:51,763 --> 00:41:54,930
to take some leave
and come down to Bajor.

735
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,100
Mmm... maybe in a few weeks.

736
00:41:57,142 --> 00:41:59,944
Right now, I feel
like staying here.

737
00:41:59,982 --> 00:42:02,476
So you can be close
to the baby.

738
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:10,237
He's a good-looking boy.

739
00:42:10,274 --> 00:42:11,573
He is, isn't he?

740
00:42:11,611 --> 00:42:17,080
Shuttle 4709 for Bajor
now departing.

741
00:42:17,123 --> 00:42:18,456
You'd better go.

742
00:42:20,632 --> 00:42:22,728
I have a few minutes left.

743
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:34,531
How does it feel
to be yourself again?

744
00:42:36,403 --> 00:42:40,276
I just... wish it hadn't
happened the way it did.

745
00:42:40,313 --> 00:42:43,115
I am sorry.

746
00:42:43,153 --> 00:42:45,124
If it helps...

747
00:42:45,158 --> 00:42:47,026
think of it as a gift...

748
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:51,371
something the changeling
wanted you to have.

749
00:42:57,253 --> 00:42:59,724
I think...

750
00:42:59,759 --> 00:43:04,361
I finally understand
how much I meant to you...

751
00:43:04,403 --> 00:43:07,844
and what you must have
gone through when I left.

752
00:43:09,282 --> 00:43:13,554
You had to find
your own way in the world.

753
00:43:13,592 --> 00:43:16,998
I should have included
you in my life.

754
00:43:17,034 --> 00:43:18,868
You still can.

755
00:43:31,602 --> 00:43:33,367
Take care of yourself, Odo.

756
00:43:47,106 --> 00:43:50,238
Uh, I thought the O'Briens
were having a party.

757
00:43:50,281 --> 00:43:51,910
Shakaar and I stopped by.

758
00:43:51,951 --> 00:43:54,252
I didn't feel much
like celebrating.

759
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:55,987
Oh?

760
00:43:56,028 --> 00:43:59,400
I got into this
because the O'Briens

761
00:43:59,435 --> 00:44:00,529
needed my help.

762
00:44:00,572 --> 00:44:02,543
I never wanted a baby.

763
00:44:02,577 --> 00:44:04,480
But now?

764
00:44:06,085 --> 00:44:09,024
I just wish I could
hold him in my arms...

765
00:44:10,762 --> 00:44:13,131
and never let him go.

766
00:44:14,271 --> 00:44:16,937
I think I know
how you feel, Nerys.

767
00:44:20,118 --> 00:44:22,089
Want to take a walk?

768
00:44:22,156 --> 00:44:23,523
Uh-huh.
