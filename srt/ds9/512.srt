1
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:10,845
(<i> groaning</i> )

2
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:13,263
Good morning,
Constable.

3
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:16,183
And what can I do
for you...<i> today?</i>

4
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,810
It's my back.

5
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,854
Let's take a look.

6
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:21,438
Oh...

7
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:24,274
It happened this morning
when I got out of bed.

8
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,609
Hmm.

9
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,194
(<i> groaning</i> )

10
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,571
I have Alvanian
spine mites, don't I?

11
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,198
Actually...

12
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:33,116
I'll be in pain
for the rest of my life.

13
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,035
Odo...

14
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,287
you have a pinched nerve.

15
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,581
Really?

16
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:40,916
It comes from bad posture.

17
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,376
Me? Ridiculous.

18
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,670
You've never seen
anyone sit so straight.

19
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,838
Exactly.

20
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,756
You carry yourself too rigidly.

21
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,968
This is how
I've always carried myself.

22
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,762
You haven't<i> always</i>
had a spinal column.

23
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,223
You're not a
changeling anymore.

24
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,850
Now that you're a humanoid,

25
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,727
you have to learn to relax.

26
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,562
Well, that's what
you said last week.

27
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:02,604
And...?

28
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,606
And it helped.

29
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,650
That and the prune juice.

30
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,778
There. You see?
Uh-huh.

31
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,113
I know what I'm
talking about.
Well...

32
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,407
QUARK:
Back trouble?

33
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,910
It's none of your
concern, Quark.

34
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,619
Bad posture.

35
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,162
Will you get out of here?

36
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,916
What you need is
a good stretching
regimen.

37
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,208
Worf's morning
exercise class

38
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,292
should be just
the thing.

39
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,045
Forget that.

40
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:28,589
I've got a holosuite program
that'll take care of him.

41
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:31,299
Three Orion slave girls
strap you...

42
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,634
Quark...

43
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,429
Go ahead-- suffer.

44
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,847
What do you want?

45
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:40,017
A Yridian I've been
dealing with

46
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,770
sold me something
that might interest you.

47
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,354
I don't think so.

48
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,731
You don't even know
what it is.

49
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,775
I know I don't want it.

50
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,651
In that case,
can you tell me

51
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,779
how to get in touch
with the Founders?

52
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:54,073
I know<i> they'll</i> want it.

53
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:55,866
What are you
talking about?

54
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:05,834
It's a changeling...

55
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,503
or it was anyway.

56
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,047
Since it's dead,

57
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,549
I'll let you have it
for five slips of latinum.

58
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,259
It's not dead.

59
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,677
In that case, make it ten.

60
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,471
It's sick.

61
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,306
Eight and we'll call it even.

62
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,308
(<i> sighs</i> )

63
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:27,188
It's a pleasure
doing business with you.

64
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,114
If that is a changeling,

65
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:37,616
maybe we should get it
into a security field.

66
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,409
That won't be
necessary.

67
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,787
But if it gets
out of that container,
it could be dangerous.

68
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,623
It's not going
anywhere, Doctor.

69
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,792
It doesn't know how.

70
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,252
It's just a baby.

71
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,709
A baby changeling?

72
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,586
Mmm. Centuries ago,
my people sent

73
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:56,671
a hundred of us
out into the galaxy

74
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,049
so we could learn
about other races.

75
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,676
When I was found, I looked
very much like this.

76
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,470
You were<i> this</i> small?

77
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,763
Mm-hmm.

78
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,182
Like a humanoid child,
it will grow.

79
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,226
Its mass will increase

80
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,561
as its shape-shifting
abilities develop.

81
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,396
As far as I can tell,
it was exposed

82
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,440
to a massive amount
of tetryon radiation.

83
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,400
I'm going to have
to purge the isotopes

84
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,902
with an electrophoretic
diffuser.

85
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,154
Get on it.

86
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,786
Are you sure it poses

87
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,746
no danger to us,
Constable?

88
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,125
When I was first discovered,
I didn't know what I was.

89
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,127
I had no memory
of where I was from.

90
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,545
I didn't even know
I had the ability

91
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,047
to mimic other forms.

92
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,799
Why would the Founders send

93
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,634
such helpless creatures
out into space?

94
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:43,927
To find out if the species

95
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,138
they encountered
posed any threat.

96
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:48,515
What better way
to gauge another race

97
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,642
than to see how it treats
the weak and vulnerable.

98
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,269
I see your point.

99
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:57,607
How long before it is able
to take humanoid form?

100
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,109
Several months.
Why?

101
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,694
Well, there's still

102
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,863
a lot we don't know
about your people.

103
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,364
The changelings could
provide Starfleet

104
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,868
with invaluable information
about the Dominion.

105
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,161
Well, that being the case,

106
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,663
I'd like to be allowed
to work with it--

107
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,290
to teach it
how to shape-shift.

108
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,709
Oh, I can't think of
anyone better qualified.

109
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:19,546
You<i> might</i> just want
a little help.

110
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,464
Maybe you should
contact Dr. Mora.

111
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,843
Mora? Why?

112
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:27,179
Well, he managed to find a way
to communicate with you.

113
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:28,429
He obviously knows
what he's doing.

114
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,059
Maybe so, but...

115
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,894
I prefer to do this alone.

116
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,020
It's your call.

117
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:41,026
But it's, uh, always nice
to have someone around

118
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,443
to help change the diapers.

119
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:45,197
I'll keep that in mind.

120
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:58,335
BASHIR:
The purge was almost
100 percent effective.

121
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:02,214
The concentration of isotopes
is nearly negligible.

122
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,258
Well, it certainly
looks healthier.

123
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,593
Well, I better go
and check on Kira.

124
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,346
Did you hear?
She's in labor.

125
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,306
Mm-hmm.

126
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,770
But I guess
you have your own baby

127
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,813
to think about.

128
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,775
There is still a small
degree of instability

129
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,068
in its morphogenic matrix.

130
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,945
I'm hoping it'll level out.

131
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,989
I've set the computer to monitor
for biomimetic fluctuations

132
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,366
just in case.

133
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,909
Thank you, Doctor.

134
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,286
Good luck.

135
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,038
(<i> grunts</i> )

136
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,422
How do you feel?

137
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,465
Better?

138
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:54,182
I realize you can't understand
a word I'm saying,

139
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,810
but that doesn't matter.

140
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,063
I<i> know</i> you're aware of me.

141
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:03,942
You see, I was once like you.

142
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,031
I spent months in a lab
being prodded and poked

143
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,700
by a scientist
who didn't recognize

144
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,453
I was a life-form.

145
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,001
He thought I was a specimen--

146
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:24,671
a mystery that needed
to be unraveled.

147
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,052
He never talked to me.

148
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,597
It didn't occur to him.

149
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,268
I didn't know what I was...

150
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,063
or what I was supposed to do.

151
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,732
I was lost.

152
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,068
Alone.

153
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:55,535
But it's not going
to be that way with you.

154
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:59,122
No, I'm not going
to make the same mistakes

155
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,208
that were made with me.

156
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,007
Come on.

157
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,802
I want to show you something.

158
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,804
(<i> rattling</i> )

159
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,015
(<i> rhythmic scraping</i> )
(<i> metallic clank</i> )

160
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,020
(<i> rhythmic scraping</i> )

161
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,105
(<i> metallic clank</i> )

162
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,744
(<i> sneezes</i> )

163
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,204
(<i> whispers</i> ):
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,054
Something's wrong.

165
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,223
Kira said this would
only take about an hour.

166
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,059
For Bajoran women,

167
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,728
giving birth is
all about being relaxed.

168
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,355
He's right, Miles.

169
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,357
That's why
it's so important for us

170
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,859
to keep the rhythm.

171
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,153
She's not going to relax
until Shakaar gets here.

172
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:15,949
I called him almost
six hours ago.

173
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,618
Only takes half that time
to make the trip from Bajor.

174
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,078
He's the First Minister
of Bajor--

175
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,204
he's a very busy man.

176
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,830
And so am I.

177
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,208
I have three surgeries
scheduled this afternoon.

178
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,002
I'll try and pop by later.

179
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,056
Y'Pora,

180
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,808
the baby is moving.

181
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,893
Relax.

182
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,645
Breathe.

183
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,564
It won't be long now.

184
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,983
Sorry I'm late.

185
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,067
How are you?

186
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,444
All right.

187
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,865
I threw you off,
didn't I?

188
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,201
It's all right.
I'll get back on track.

189
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,578
I'm glad you're here.

190
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,330
(<i> loud clang</i> )

191
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,001
ODO:
This is the Replimat.

192
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,003
Humanoids come here to eat.

193
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,879
They...

194
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:16,092
we, rather, need
to ingest nutrients.

195
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,802
This is my home.

196
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,554
It's a space station.

197
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:23,308
People of many different
species live here together.

198
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:26,769
After you've learned
to take humanoid shape,

199
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,062
I'll show you everything.

200
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,524
You can live here, too,
if you want.

201
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,108
It's a fascinating place.

202
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,153
Constable, why are you talking
to your beverage?

203
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,198
It's not a beverage.

204
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,244
It's a changeling.

205
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,412
Excuse me, Commander.

206
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:56,799
There we go, huh?

207
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,177
Now, doesn't that feel better?

208
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,304
Nothing like spreading
yourself out

209
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,515
after being cooped up
in a jar, huh?

210
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:06,643
(<i> chuckles and sighs</i> )

211
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:11,272
You have no idea of the marvels
that are in store for you.

212
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,359
Do you know what you are?

213
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,611
You're a changeling--

214
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:19,614
a shape-shifter.

215
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,866
You can<i> be</i> anything--

216
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:26,037
a Tarkalean hawk
soaring through the sky,

217
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:30,833
or a Filian python burrowing
deep beneath the ground.

218
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,835
It's all yours for the taking.

219
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:43,054
I was never
a very good shape-shifter.

220
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,972
If you could see
the face I'm stuck with,

221
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,891
you'd know what I mean.

222
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:51,730
But I think I can be
a good teacher.

223
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,692
You'll be better
than I ever was.

224
00:12:55,692 --> 00:13:00,154
And I promise I'll never treat
you the way I was treated.

225
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,448
Never.

226
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,699
(<i> door opens</i> )

227
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,368
Odo!

228
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,912
Dr. Mora.

229
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,831
What are you doing here?

230
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,125
Well, I heard
about the changeling.

231
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,378
I came to help.

232
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,428
MORA:
Remarkable.

233
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:27,098
You know, i-i-it's much
larger than you were.

234
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,183
What is that-- about
a quarter of a liter?

235
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,727
I suppose so.

236
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,604
You didn't measure it?

237
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:35,982
What difference does
it make how large it is?

238
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:39,068
It could make a great
deal of difference.

239
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,904
Size could be an
indication that it's

240
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,532
already exercised its
ability to shape-shift.

241
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,578
I thought you were

242
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,747
on Earth working
with Starfleet

243
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,958
on new ways to detect
changeling infiltrators.

244
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,671
Mmm. Fortunately, I was visiting
my parents on Bajor

245
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,964
when I got the news
of your find.

246
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,091
How are<i> you,</i> Odo?

247
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,593
I've been worried.

248
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,136
Worried?

249
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,429
I heard that your people

250
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,222
took away your ability
to shape-shift.

251
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:12,059
Thank you for your
concern, but I'm fine.

252
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,812
I knew you were going
to say that.

253
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:16,314
You never want
to give anything away,

254
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:19,108
even though it's all
right there in your face.

255
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,573
Well, let's get started, hmm?

256
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,201
We have a lot of work
ahead of us.
Actually, Doctor...

257
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,661
I told Starfleet I
wouldn't be coming back

258
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:30,704
for a couple of weeks.

259
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:31,996
That may have been premature.

260
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,540
No, it'll take
at least that long

261
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,416
to get the changeling
to respond.

262
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,168
Don't do that!

263
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,549
Well, I see you
still have trouble

264
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,425
controlling your temper.

265
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,094
I was just trying
to determine its mass.

266
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,889
Dr. Mora, I understand
that you want to help,

267
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,933
but I'm going
to do this alone.

268
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,061
Alone?

269
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,104
Odo, you don't know
the first thing

270
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,774
about teaching a changeling
how to shape-shift.

271
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:03,194
Well, then, I'll just
muddle through somehow.

272
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,029
You did.

273
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:16,416
It's too warm
in here.

274
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,958
You know,
a changeling's

275
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,211
morphogenic matrix
is most malleable

276
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,630
at 17 degrees
Celsius.

277
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,840
I used to be able
to change shape

278
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,592
in almost any temperature.

279
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:29,178
That's true, but why not

280
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,598
make it easy for
the changeling?

281
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,892
It took me weeks

282
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:36,603
to figure out the
optimal temperature,

283
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,230
the humidity, even
the light levels.

284
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,981
Now, don't you think

285
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,817
that's information
you could use?

286
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,404
Well, I...

287
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:49,115
suppose I could look
at your reports.

288
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,950
Oh, well, feel free
to, of course--

289
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,286
except I was never one
to keep extensive records.

290
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,705
I always wanted to move
on to the next test.

291
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:59,500
Oh, believe me,
I remember your<i> tests</i>

292
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,627
very well.

293
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,837
Oh.

294
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,214
So that's what
this is about.

295
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:08,050
You still resent the
things I did to you

296
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,720
in order to induce
you to shape-shift.

297
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,764
Well, I know they
weren't pleasant for you,

298
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:15,141
but really, Odo,
I would hope

299
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,644
that you would get
past that by now.

300
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,562
I<i> am</i> disappointed.

301
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,815
I have my own ideas

302
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,858
about how to teach
the changeling.

303
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,318
I imagine they're
less invasive.

304
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,319
Exactly.

305
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,821
Hmm.

306
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,739
You don't think that
I can do it, do you?

307
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:30,949
I didn't say that.

308
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:32,867
As a matter of fact,

309
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:35,620
I'd be fascinated to see
what you have in mind.

310
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,790
Well, in that case, why don't
you stay... and observe?

311
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,794
If you insist.

312
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:51,803
(<i> gasps</i> )

313
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,053
What's wrong?

314
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,597
I... I don't know.

315
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,850
It was like a cramp
or something.

316
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,392
You shouldn't
be feeling any pain.

317
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,689
Well... it appears
you're not going

318
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,691
to be having the baby today.

319
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:05,692
What?!

320
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,151
You were in labor too long.

321
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,154
I wonder why.

322
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,990
Y'PORA:
For<i> whatever</i> reason,

323
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,074
you weren't able to fully relax.

324
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,369
Your system had to stop
producing endorphins

325
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,163
before they accumulated
to toxic levels.

326
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,748
When<i> will</i> she have the baby?

327
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,543
It could be a few more days--

328
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,294
or a few more weeks.

329
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,880
Weeks?

330
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,381
Oh, if I don't have
this baby soon,

331
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,341
I'm going to go out of my mind.

332
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:33,678
Well, if you want, you can go
see Dr. Bashir and have him...

333
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,221
No, no, I...

334
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,975
I want to have this baby
the traditional Bajoran way.

335
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,686
We're 100 percent
behind you, Nerys.

336
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:42,812
Right, Miles?

337
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,981
Absolutely.

338
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,026
Can you stay?

339
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:50,361
I'll have to rearrange
my schedule,

340
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,821
but I think so.

341
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:55,658
Nerys, return to
your quarters and rest.

342
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,535
I'll come by
and see you later.

343
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,537
You.

344
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:04,291
Be punctual next time
or don't come at all.

345
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,337
And you?
Practice.

346
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:18,639
This... is a sphere.

347
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:22,560
It's one of<i> the</i> most basic forms
in nature.

348
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,189
See how it rolls?

349
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,906
Interesting, isn't it?

350
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:36,950
You're in my light.

351
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,827
(<i> scoffs</i> )

352
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,623
Now...

353
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,209
this won't hurt a bit.

354
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,213
Here we are.
Here we go.

355
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,842
Yeah. Yeah.

356
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,469
Yeah-yeah.

357
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,763
Now...

358
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,432
this is also a sphere.

359
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:04,477
Huh?

360
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,271
Feel... its symmetry,

361
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,440
the softness
of its shape.

362
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,442
The sameness, huh.

363
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:13,360
Now...

364
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,445
you try.

365
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,039
Ah...

366
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,874
There we are.

367
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,669
(<i> sighs</i> )

368
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,838
I understand

369
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,214
that you prefer
to remain shapeless.

370
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,510
Believe me, I remember
how relaxing it could be.

371
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,764
But you have to learn
to take other forms.

372
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,683
That's what changelings do.

373
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,102
It can be immensely rewarding.

374
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:50,940
I remember the first time
Dr. Mora here coerced me

375
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,859
into taking the shape
of a cube

376
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:56,154
with one of his
electrostatic gadgets.

377
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:59,198
Once I did it, and he turned
the infernal thing off,

378
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,994
I was perfectly content
to stay a cube for hours.

379
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:06,039
It was fascinating--
all those right angles.

380
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:10,292
Of course, he had other plans.

381
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,669
Before I knew it,

382
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:14,922
he had me spinning
around in a centrifuge.

383
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:19,844
Well...

384
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:23,681
if you're not interested
in a sphere right now,

385
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,100
we can always try...

386
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,393
a cube.

387
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,854
What do you think?

388
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,815
All right. Now...

389
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:35,776
this is a pyramid.

390
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,196
It's one of the most

391
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,989
mysterious shapes
in nature.

392
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,944
What are you doing?

393
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,614
I'm measuring
its volume.

394
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:27,369
It's been here a week,
and it's only grown 17 percent.

395
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:30,289
After three days in my lab,
you were twice that size.

396
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,833
Well, maybe I was
anxious to grow up

397
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,169
so I could get
out of there.

398
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:38,756
My point is,
you've made no progress.

399
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:39,966
By this time,
I'd already gotten you

400
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,301
to mimic half a dozen
simple forms.

401
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,303
I am trying to gain
its confidence,

402
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,846
not teach it tricks.

403
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,390
It's a shame
you're not a changeling anymore.

404
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,976
You could link with it

405
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:52,270
and teach it everything
it needs to know.

406
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,606
You make it sound
like it's my fault.

407
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:56,690
It might very well be.

408
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,567
Let's face it, Odo.

409
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,402
Your shape-shifting ability
was somewhat limited.

410
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,489
Maybe that's why your people
were able to force you

411
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,158
to<i> take</i> a humanoid form.

412
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:07,160
That is pure speculation.

413
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,869
Let's run a few tests
and find out.

414
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,663
Oh! You are just dying to get me

415
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,706
into one of your contraptions,
aren't you?

416
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:13,791
I'm trying to help.

417
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,793
I am not about
to submit myself

418
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,045
to another round
of your experiments.

419
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:21,340
Everything I did to you
was for your own good.

420
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,050
Ha!

421
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,928
True, some of the tests
that I subjected you to

422
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:28,306
proved inconclusive.

423
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:31,309
The vacuum chamber
springs to mind.

424
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:33,519
The cytoplasmic separator...

425
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,814
Come to think of it,
the protein decompiler as well.

426
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:39,357
How could I know
until I tried?

427
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:41,068
By the Prophets, Odo,

428
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,863
I wasn't even sure
you were a life-form.

429
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,531
I wasn't sure about you either.

430
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,741
Once I realized
you were sentient,

431
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,869
oh, the Cardassians
wanted to know

432
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,369
everything about you.

433
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,164
I was under
enormous pressure

434
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:56,709
to come up with
results, and I did.

435
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,585
<i>My</i> technique worked.

436
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,880
The fact that you
are standing here

437
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,132
whining about it
proves it.

438
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,592
You enjoyed
watching me suffer.

439
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,094
You really believe that?

440
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,138
How pathetic.

441
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,723
If it wasn't for me,

442
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,059
you'd still be sitting
on a shelf somewhere

443
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,728
in a beaker labeled
"unknown sample."

444
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,356
If it wasn't for<i> me,</i>
you'd be a nobody.

445
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:21,692
Starfleet wouldn't hire you
to judge a science fair.

446
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,777
I'm getting a little tired
of sitting around watching you,

447
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,113
but I can't seem
to pull myself away.

448
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,574
I can't wait to see what
next<i> preposterous</i> thing

449
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,743
you're going to try.

450
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:33,204
Who knows? Maybe
in a couple of months,

451
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:36,749
it may get so tired
of your incessant chatter

452
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,709
that it might
actually do something.

453
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:41,879
Oh, you'd just love
to get your hands on it,
wouldn't you?

454
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:43,756
You could sell tickets
on the Promenade.

455
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,966
"Dr. Mora's Chamber
of Horrors--

456
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,301
"open for business.

457
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,969
Right this way!"

458
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:53,391
Captain.
How's it going,
gentlemen?

459
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:56,434
(<i> clears throat</i> )

460
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,271
Making progress, sir.

461
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:01,232
I'm glad to hear it.

462
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:04,026
I was just talking
with Starfleet Command.

463
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,652
They want you
to establish communication

464
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:08,364
with the changeling as soon
as possible.

465
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:09,782
At the rate
we're going,

466
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,243
that is still
a long way off.

467
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:13,827
Better not be too long.

468
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,537
Otherwise,
Starfleet is going to want

469
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,039
to take over the project.

470
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,291
Sir...

471
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,959
As long as you're
making progress,

472
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,253
there's nothing to worry about.

473
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,340
Oh, by the way...

474
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,760
Starfleet wants you to file
daily reports for their review.

475
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,346
Understood, sir.

476
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:34,974
Carry on.

477
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,988
Now you understand
the kind of pressure

478
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,073
I was going through.

479
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:56,620
I brought my old
equipment from Bajor.

480
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,539
Maybe it's time
we started unpacking.

481
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:20,060
Any time you're ready.

482
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:22,480
(<i> sighs</i> )

483
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:34,658
Don't worry.

484
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,619
You're going to get
through this all right.

485
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:41,957
Oh, no... no, no.

486
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:45,002
I'm just an
observer here.

487
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,012
(<i> clears throat</i> )

488
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,896
Odo, the changeling
won't respond

489
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,815
to anything less
than six millivolts.

490
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,986
There must be some other way.

491
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:15,449
Spare the rod, spoil the child.

492
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,868
Odo, without discomfort,

493
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:21,205
the changeling will be
perfectly comfortable

494
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:23,623
to remain
in its gelatinous state.

495
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,667
It'll just lie there...

496
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:29,547
never realizing it has the
ability to mimic other forms--

497
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:32,132
never living up
to its potential.

498
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,843
Odo, six millivolts
is not going to hurt it.

499
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,430
Once it realizes there's
no charge in the center,

500
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,639
the procedure
will be finished.

501
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:44,019
(<i> clears throat</i> )

502
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,063
(<i> sighs</i> )

503
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,986
(<i> gasps</i> )

504
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,615
Checking to see
if I'm enjoying myself?

505
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,333
That's it.
You've found it.

506
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,502
(<i> chuckling</i> )

507
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:12,005
<i>I</i> smiled the first time
you did that.

508
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:16,634
Little did I realize
you would end up
hating me for it.

509
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,972
Well, shall we move on?

510
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:22,640
Why not?

511
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,404
(<i> clearing throat</i> )

512
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:37,448
Edon.

513
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,329
How you feeling?

514
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:44,538
I'm all right.

515
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:46,123
My feet are
a little swollen.

516
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,416
A little?

517
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,084
They've never been this bad.

518
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,462
Well, there's a zero-grav
tumbling performance

519
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:53,005
on the Promenade tonight.

520
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,006
Do you want to go?

521
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:55,466
Well, maybe.

522
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:57,968
You can't go standing around
for an hour.

523
00:27:57,968 --> 00:28:01,472
Chief, would you mind
leaving us alone for a minute?

524
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:03,390
I'm almost done.

525
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,225
Well, I'll take over.

526
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,060
I think it's time.

527
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,687
You got to do it harder.
I know what I'm doing.

528
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,649
It's time.
And you
got to work

529
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:14,067
<i>up</i> the legs.
It's time!

530
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,200
(<i> grunts</i> )

531
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,247
ODO:
Now, if I were you,

532
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,124
I'd hold this shape.

533
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:32,169
Otherwise, you'll be
in for a little shock.

534
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,340
Ah.

535
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:43,222
ODO:
Wait a minute.

536
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,854
I had to try that three times
before you caught on.

537
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,774
Actually, the first two times,

538
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:57,069
I didn't hold my shape
on purpose.

539
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:00,155
You're not serious.

540
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:04,577
I suppose I didn't want
to give you the satisfaction.

541
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:11,083
Well, someday,
if you're very lucky...

542
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,670
this changeling...

543
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,214
will give you
the satisfaction of saying,

544
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,549
"Thank you very much.

545
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:20,718
You did so
much for me."

546
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,555
Then again...

547
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:25,931
it may leave...

548
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:28,975
the way you did.

549
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,394
It will announce

550
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:32,396
that it's striking
out on its own,

551
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,523
and you will never...

552
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:35,774
hear from it again.

553
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,697
I'm going to get something
to eat.

554
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:47,369
(<i> rustling</i> )

555
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:23,113
(<i> both laughing quietly</i> )

556
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:25,157
Oh...

557
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,164
I mean, the eyes...
When he rose up...

558
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,082
...the eyes are incredible.
...for a minute there

559
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,751
I thought he was going
to say something.

560
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,003
Oh, put that down.
We're celebrating.

561
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:40,213
Oh, uh, it's just that
I've fallen behind

562
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,716
in my security reports
over these last few days.

563
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:43,967
Well, you can
catch up later.

564
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,594
Aren't you excited
by what happened?

565
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,137
Of course, I'm excited.

566
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:49,973
You know, tomorrow, we
can expose the changeling

567
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,058
to some simple life-forms

568
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:55,187
so it can mimic them--
some algae, some fungus.

569
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,189
In a few more days,
maybe even an invertebrate.

570
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:58,649
I can't wait
until I can

571
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:00,693
actually communicate
with it.

572
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,653
There's so much
I want it to see,

573
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:04,196
so much I want to share.

574
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,532
Well, you may get that chance
sooner than you think.

575
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:08,826
The changeling is developing
far faster than you did.

576
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:12,204
I-I-I don't mean that
as a criticism.

577
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,872
If anything,
it's a compliment.

578
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,749
I mean, I was wrong.

579
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:19,503
Your approach to communicating
to the changeling was sound.

580
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:20,671
I mean, don't you see?

581
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:22,297
It's reaching out to you.

582
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,800
It's curious
about you.

583
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,510
The first time you
ever did anything

584
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,846
like that was when you
formed a tentacle

585
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:31,139
to slap my hand
away from the control panel.

586
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,558
I remember.

587
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,686
I wanted you to stop zapping me.

588
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:42,984
You formed a connection
with this changeling.

589
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:46,946
That is something I was
never able to do with you.

590
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,365
That's not true.

591
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,785
I respected you.

592
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:53,829
You feared me.

593
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:55,873
You didn't know what I was.

594
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:57,708
You were experimenting

595
00:31:57,708 --> 00:32:00,627
on what looked like
a lump of organic residue.

596
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,630
That's what I'd still be
if it weren't for you.

597
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,636
You don't know
how much it means to me

598
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,304
to hear you say that.

599
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,558
I'm sorry.

600
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:17,519
I know this kind of talk
makes you uncomfortable.

601
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,438
But I suppose it's all my fault.

602
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,774
If I hadn't poked
and prodded you so much,

603
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:24,276
you may have grown up with
a less forbidding disposition.

604
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,863
Well, something tells me

605
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:31,116
no matter what we do
to that changeling,

606
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:34,494
it's going to have a more
pleasant disposition than mine.

607
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,789
It's just
the way I am.

608
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:41,084
Well...

609
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,294
I'll leave you
to your work.

610
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,005
Dr. Mora?

611
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,761
(<i> clears throat</i> )

612
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:55,432
Two glasses of champagne,
please.

613
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,143
We're celebrating.

614
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:24,002
(<i> breathing deeply</i> )

615
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,506
The baby has turned.

616
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,257
It's time.

617
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,597
Awake, child.

618
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:37,766
We await you
with love.

619
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,810
And welcome you
into the world.

620
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,269
Why don't you stay there?

621
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,480
I can't see from here.
Exactly.

622
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,190
It's my baby.

623
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,275
Shh.
I think it would make
Nerys uncomfortable.

624
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,402
What are you
talking about?

625
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,070
She's been living in my home
for the last five months.

626
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,657
Be quiet.
What's that supposed to mean?

627
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,074
Look, I missed Molly's birth.

628
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,576
I am not going to miss this one.

629
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,286
I'm trying to have a baby.

630
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,956
I am sick

631
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:03,792
of this ridiculous
little competition

632
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,752
between the two of you.

633
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,714
Now, if one of you
says one more word,

634
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:11,090
you're going to have to leave.

635
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,468
Fine, just tell him to...
Just tell him to...

636
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,136
All right, that's it.
Out, both of you.

637
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,346
Kira...
Nerys...

638
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:18,139
Go.

639
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,432
You're joking.

640
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:22,519
Does it look like
she's joking?

641
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:23,645
Out.

642
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:31,945
Nice going.

643
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:33,572
Oh, do me a favor.

644
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,490
Next time you have a baby,

645
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,784
leave my girlfriend
out of it, huh?

646
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,710
Comes to...

647
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,755
three hundred and twenty-four.

648
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:53,132
I'm going to have to start
watering the drinks again.

649
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,176
(<i> clanking</i> )

650
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,386
Constable?

651
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,472
Quark!

652
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:00,974
What are you doing
back there?

653
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:02,475
What does it look
like I'm doing?

654
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,062
We're closed.
Have a seat.

655
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:07,313
You're in a good mood.

656
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,148
Yes, I am.

657
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:12,193
Which means you're probably
about to arrest me

658
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,029
on some trumped-up charge.

659
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,155
Not at all.

660
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:18,575
<i>I</i> am buying<i> you</i> a drink.

661
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,498
Why?

662
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,792
Dr. Mora has gone

663
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:29,044
to sleep, and<i> I...</i>

664
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:32,130
still feel like celebrating.

665
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,381
What are you up to?

666
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,425
I am happy, Quark.

667
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:36,969
Can't you just accept that?

668
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:39,304
No.
It doesn't fit.

669
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:42,265
If you're happy,
there's something
very wrong in the world.

670
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,935
The center cannot hold.

671
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:46,311
There we go.

672
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:48,688
I've got it.

673
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,107
You're getting back at me

674
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:51,984
for selling you
that sick changeling.

675
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:54,987
Actually, I
should thank you.

676
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:57,530
If you want the money back,
just say so.

677
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,783
It changed my life.

678
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,701
Here's to you, Quark.

679
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:05,998
All right, all right,
I confess.

680
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:08,708
I don't know what I did,
but I did it.

681
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,919
Just stop.
I can't take it anymore.

682
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,214
Do you ever think
about having children?

683
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,800
Huh?

684
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,635
See, I never did.

685
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,846
It just seemed like
too much trouble,

686
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:23,222
but then fate...

687
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,308
dropped one into my lap...

688
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,977
and I couldn't be happier.

689
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:29,270
(<i> laughs</i> )
Cheers.

690
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,230
(<i> chuckling</i> )

691
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,025
Strange.

692
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:34,901
Over the past few months,
I came to accept the fact

693
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,820
that I'd never have any contact
with my people again.

694
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,738
They rejected me.

695
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,741
They turned me
into a humanoid and...

696
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,827
part of me was lost forever.

697
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:51,459
But that...

698
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:55,547
little ball of goo
back in the lab

699
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,549
changed everything.

700
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:01,636
I feel as if I'm...

701
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,430
experiencing what it is...

702
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,892
to be a changeling again.

703
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,062
And somehow...

704
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:14,816
being a solid
doesn't seem so bad anymore.

705
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:17,736
(<i> both laughing</i> )

706
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:21,114
Fill me up.

707
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,867
Computer to Security Chief Odo,
please acknowledge.

708
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,660
Go ahead.

709
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,121
The life-form being monitored
is displaying

710
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:30,707
biomimetic fluctuations
beyond stated parameters.

711
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:32,167
Have Dr. Mora meet me

712
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,418
in the Science Lab.

713
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:34,627
Acknowledged.

714
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:41,551
What's happened?

715
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:44,637
Its morphogenic matrix
is destabilizing.

716
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,101
It's dying.

717
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,360
Its life signs are fading.

718
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,238
The radiation must have
damaged its cytoplasm

719
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:02,948
in a way we weren't
able to detect.

720
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,532
There must be something
you can do.

721
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,659
You might try an
enzymatic induction.

722
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,412
That might stabilize the
biomimetic fluctuations.

723
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,413
It's worth a shot.

724
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,831
It has to work.
It has to--

725
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,250
Odo, please,
wait outside.

726
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,001
We'll do everything
we can.

727
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,425
I feel...

728
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:25,804
so good.

729
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,889
You're doing
great, Nerys.

730
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:38,399
Here he comes.

731
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,777
Keiko...

732
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:42,361
would you do me a favor?

733
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,742
Kira said you can
both come back in

734
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,120
if you promise to behave.

735
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,248
Oh, after you.

736
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,500
Oh, no. After you.<i> </i>
<i>Please...</i>

737
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,044
Will you two get in here?
You're going to miss everything.

738
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,887
That's it, Nerys.

739
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,472
Relax.

740
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,474
Let it come.

741
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,352
That's right.
Breathe.

742
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,855
(<i> baby crying</i> )

743
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,001
Oh.

744
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:40,295
Look at him, Miles.

745
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,047
He's beautiful.

746
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:44,924
(<i> crying</i> )

747
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,893
There's nothing
we could do.

748
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,811
I'm sorry, Odo.

749
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,189
It won't be very long now.

750
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,801
Please...

751
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,803
don't die.

752
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,181
There's so much
I want to show you.

753
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:36,976
I was going to teach you
how to be a Tarkalean hawk,

754
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,228
remember?

755
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:45,068
(<i> gasping</i> )

756
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:46,652
What happened?
Where did it go?

757
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:49,114
It somehow integrated itself
into Odo's body.

758
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:51,366
(<i> gasping</i> )

759
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:52,491
Odo, what's wrong?

760
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,288
It can't be!
What?

761
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:59,332
(<i> gasping</i> )

762
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,312
(<i> hawk screeches</i> )

763
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,508
This, uh,
might be a good time

764
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,678
to take some leave
and come down to Bajor.

765
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,888
Mmm... maybe
in a few weeks.

766
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:58,766
Right now, I feel
like staying here.

767
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,227
So you can be close
to the baby.

768
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,943
He's a good-looking boy.

769
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,278
He is, isn't he?

770
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:15,741
Shuttle 4709 for Bajor
now departing.

771
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,243
You'd better go.

772
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:21,331
I have a few minutes left.

773
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:33,301
How does it feel
to be yourself again?

774
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:38,973
I just... wish it hadn't
happened the way it did.

775
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,767
I<i> am</i> sorry.

776
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:44,020
If it helps...

777
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,646
think of it as a gift...

778
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:50,068
something the changeling
wanted you to have.

779
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:58,617
I think...

780
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:03,248
I finally understand
how much I meant to you...

781
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:06,459
and what you must have
gone through when I left.

782
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:12,465
You had to find
your own way in the world.

783
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:15,885
I should have included
you in my life.

784
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:17,470
You still can.

785
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,817
Take care of yourself, Odo.

786
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,364
(<i> clears throat</i> )

787
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,625
Uh, I thought
the O'Briens

788
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,127
were having a party.

789
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:50,628
Shakaar and I stopped by.

790
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,880
I didn't feel much
like celebrating.

791
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,715
Oh?

792
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:58,052
I got into this
because the O'Briens

793
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,220
needed my help.

794
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,222
I never wanted a baby.

795
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:03,224
But now?

796
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,645
I just wish I could
hold him in my arms...

797
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:11,774
and never let him go.

798
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:15,528
I think I know
how you feel, Nerys.

799
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:20,699
Want to take a walk?

800
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,243
Uh-huh.
