1
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:08,076
Captain's Personal Log,
Stardate 517...

2
00:00:08,112 --> 00:00:10,174
3, uh...

3
00:00:10,283 --> 00:00:12,778
517...

4
00:00:12,823 --> 00:00:13,985
4?

5
00:00:14,026 --> 00:00:15,690
Computer, what day is it?

6
00:00:15,731 --> 00:00:18,864
Stardate 51721.3.

7
00:00:19,909 --> 00:00:21,675
It's only been two weeks.

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,923
I need to talk about this.

9
00:00:28,965 --> 00:00:34,070
I have to justify what's
happened, what I've done...

10
00:00:34,112 --> 00:00:36,641
at least to myself.

11
00:00:36,686 --> 00:00:39,592
I can't talk to anyone else...

12
00:00:39,626 --> 00:00:41,928
not even to Dax.

13
00:00:41,966 --> 00:00:44,130
Maybe if I

14
00:00:44,172 --> 00:00:50,485
just lay it all out in my log,
it'll finally make sense.

15
00:00:50,522 --> 00:00:53,188
I can see
where it all went wrong...

16
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:55,132
where I went wrong.

17
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:00,177
I suppose
it started two weeks ago

18
00:01:00,213 --> 00:01:04,554
while I was posting the weekly
casualty list in the Wardroom.

19
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:07,029
Every Friday morning
for the past three months

20
00:01:07,064 --> 00:01:08,533
I've posted the official list

21
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:12,876
of Starfleet personnel killed,
wounded or missing in the war.

22
00:01:12,913 --> 00:01:16,012
It's become something
of a grim ritual around here.

23
00:01:16,054 --> 00:01:18,150
Not a week goes by

24
00:01:18,193 --> 00:01:20,495
that someone doesn't find
the name of a loved one

25
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:25,170
a friend or an acquaintance
on that damned list.

26
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:27,979
I've grown to hate Fridays.

27
00:01:32,497 --> 00:01:33,898
Who is it, Dax?

28
00:01:33,934 --> 00:01:36,098
Leslie Wong.

29
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,202
The Skipper of the <i>Cairo?</i>

30
00:01:38,245 --> 00:01:40,513
She was an instructor
at the Academy

31
00:01:40,552 --> 00:01:41,885
when I was a sophomore.

32
00:01:41,922 --> 00:01:43,950
Do you know what happened
to the <i>Cairo?</i>

33
00:01:43,994 --> 00:01:46,762
No, just that she
disappeared on patrol

34
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:48,327
in the Romulan Neutral Zone.

35
00:01:48,372 --> 00:01:49,363
I'll look into it.

36
00:01:49,408 --> 00:01:51,003
Don't bother... I'm sure

37
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:52,207
it's the same old story.

38
00:01:52,248 --> 00:01:54,310
The Jem'Hadar crossed
the Romulan border

39
00:01:54,354 --> 00:01:56,052
and caught them by surprise.

40
00:01:56,091 --> 00:01:58,757
It's only about the hundredth
time it's happened.

41
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,531
I can't believe
the Romulans allow them

42
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,370
to violate their territory
so brazenly.

43
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:03,742
Why do they get away with it?

44
00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:04,975
The Romulans have a treaty

45
00:02:05,015 --> 00:02:07,853
of nonaggression and friendship
with the Dominion.

46
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:11,022
So they're willing to turn
a blind eye to almost anything

47
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,328
in the name of friendship.

48
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:14,304
What we need to do is
bring the Romulans

49
00:02:14,339 --> 00:02:15,603
into the war on our side.

50
00:02:15,643 --> 00:02:16,805
With the combined forces

51
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:18,783
of the Federation,
the Klingons and the Romulans

52
00:02:18,818 --> 00:02:20,310
we could finally
go on the offensive.

53
00:02:20,354 --> 00:02:22,656
That's the last thing
the Romulans want.

54
00:02:22,694 --> 00:02:23,822
Think about it.

55
00:02:23,864 --> 00:02:25,698
They're in
the perfect position.

56
00:02:25,736 --> 00:02:27,103
They get to sit back and watch

57
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:29,407
as their biggest rivals
slug it out

58
00:02:29,512 --> 00:02:30,981
in a long, bloody war.

59
00:02:31,015 --> 00:02:33,043
No one's threatening
their interests.

60
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,922
Why should
they risk their necks?

61
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,429
There's simply
no reason for them

62
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,931
to get involved in our war...

63
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:40,337
no reason at all.

64
00:02:40,373 --> 00:02:42,743
That was the moment
I made the decision.

65
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,979
It was like I had stepped
through a door

66
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:46,352
and locked it behind me.

67
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:49,363
I was going to bring
the Romulans into the war.

68
00:04:47,294 --> 00:04:49,596
It's in their own best
interests to join the war.

69
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:50,659
That's the key.

70
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:53,537
That's the reason the Romulans
will finally take action

71
00:04:53,577 --> 00:04:54,671
not to do us any favors

72
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,378
but to protect themselves
from the Dominion.

73
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,690
Okay, let's say
I'm the Romulan Proconsul.

74
00:05:00,728 --> 00:05:01,822
From where I'm sitting

75
00:05:01,865 --> 00:05:03,597
the Dominion isn't
a threat to me.

76
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,835
I have a nonaggression pact
with them.

77
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:07,311
They are my allies.

78
00:05:07,346 --> 00:05:08,815
You're not going
to put your faith

79
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:10,284
in some piece of paper, are you?

80
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,018
Not at all.

81
00:05:12,057 --> 00:05:13,652
I've been watching them
very closely

82
00:05:13,695 --> 00:05:15,096
since the beginning of the war

83
00:05:15,132 --> 00:05:18,470
and so far, they've kept
their part of the bargain.

84
00:05:18,508 --> 00:05:20,878
They're violating your territory
almost every day.

85
00:05:20,915 --> 00:05:22,647
What kind of an ally is that?

86
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:24,953
So they're crossing my backyard

87
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,962
to give the Federation
a bloody nose.

88
00:05:26,996 --> 00:05:28,933
I can't say that makes me feel
very sad.

89
00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:30,701
You can't be naive enough
to think

90
00:05:30,739 --> 00:05:33,177
that the Dominion is going
to stop with the Federation.

91
00:05:33,213 --> 00:05:35,947
When they're finished with us,
they're coming after you.

92
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:37,981
That's speculation.

93
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:39,517
The Founders see it
as their sacred duty

94
00:05:39,562 --> 00:05:41,260
to bring order to the galaxy...
their order.

95
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,895
Do you think they'll sit idly by

96
00:05:42,938 --> 00:05:44,636
while you keep
your chaotic empire

97
00:05:44,676 --> 00:05:47,080
right next
to their perfect order? No.

98
00:05:47,115 --> 00:05:49,644
If you watch us go under,
then what you're really doing

99
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:51,249
is signing
your own death warrant.

100
00:05:51,293 --> 00:05:54,061
But before I plunge my people
into a conflict

101
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:57,634
that will kill millions
of loyal Romulan citizens

102
00:05:57,676 --> 00:06:00,205
I need something more concrete

103
00:06:00,249 --> 00:06:04,089
than the self-serving argument
of a Starfleet officer.

104
00:06:04,127 --> 00:06:06,725
I need proof
of Dominion duplicity.

105
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,262
Not more words...

106
00:06:09,307 --> 00:06:10,640
proof.

107
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,023
Very good, old man.

108
00:06:18,063 --> 00:06:19,795
You would have made
a decent Romulan.

109
00:06:21,237 --> 00:06:24,439
I prefer the spots
to the pointed ears.

110
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,252
Okay, you've convinced me.

111
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:29,987
They're going to need evidence.

112
00:06:32,165 --> 00:06:34,193
But if there is evidence

113
00:06:34,238 --> 00:06:37,235
of a Dominion plan
to attack Romulus

114
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:39,774
it's probably buried
deep in the bowels

115
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:42,451
of their headquarters
on Cardassia Prime.

116
00:06:42,493 --> 00:06:45,193
Not exactly the most accessible
place in the galaxy.

117
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,265
Hmm...

118
00:06:50,246 --> 00:06:54,120
Not for us, maybe, but there is
someone on this station

119
00:06:54,157 --> 00:06:56,356
who specializes
in gaining access

120
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:58,697
to places
where he is not welcome.

121
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:01,401
I must say I'm flattered,
Captain.

122
00:07:01,442 --> 00:07:05,441
I had no idea you held such
a lofty opinion of me.

123
00:07:05,486 --> 00:07:07,514
Your faith in my ability

124
00:07:07,558 --> 00:07:09,495
to retrieve
classified information

125
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,058
from my former homeland
is most gratifying.

126
00:07:12,102 --> 00:07:15,042
Mr. Garak, let's dispense
with the usual repartee

127
00:07:15,077 --> 00:07:17,311
and concentrate
on the issue at hand.

128
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,876
Can you do it or not?

129
00:07:20,658 --> 00:07:24,600
No one wants to see the Dominion
destroyed more than I do

130
00:07:24,635 --> 00:07:26,799
but to go to Cardassia Prime

131
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:29,143
penetrate one of the most
heavily guarded facilities

132
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:32,314
in the Quadrant,
steal top secret war plans

133
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:34,486
and then return them
safely to you

134
00:07:34,528 --> 00:07:36,590
is not just another job.

135
00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:38,661
It's more like a suicide mission

136
00:07:38,705 --> 00:07:44,050
and that is well outside
my field of expertise.

137
00:07:45,857 --> 00:07:49,195
I didn't say you had
to go there yourself.

138
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:52,230
I have to believe
that a man like you

139
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:55,111
still has a few contacts
at home...

140
00:07:55,148 --> 00:07:58,554
a colleague
from the Obsidian Order...

141
00:07:58,591 --> 00:08:01,155
an old friend...

142
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:03,897
a reliable informant...

143
00:08:03,937 --> 00:08:06,671
someone who might owe you
a favor.

144
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:08,614
Perhaps.

145
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,022
Then I'd say it's time
to call in a favor.

146
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:15,795
It would mean calling in
all my favors, Captain.

147
00:08:15,835 --> 00:08:18,364
To do what you're asking
would use up

148
00:08:18,408 --> 00:08:23,479
every resource I have left
on Cardassia.

149
00:08:23,521 --> 00:08:25,651
And it may be...

150
00:08:25,694 --> 00:08:28,964
a very messy,
very bloody business.

151
00:08:29,036 --> 00:08:31,804
Are you prepared for that?

152
00:08:34,617 --> 00:08:37,989
I posted my 14th casualty
list this morning.

153
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,690
I'm already involved

154
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:43,638
in a very messy,
very bloody business.

155
00:08:44,643 --> 00:08:47,172
And the only way
I can see to end it

156
00:08:47,216 --> 00:08:49,688
is to bring the Romulans
into the war.

157
00:08:49,723 --> 00:08:52,127
I am prepared to do
whatever it takes

158
00:08:52,162 --> 00:08:55,660
to accomplish that goal,
but I can't do it alone.

159
00:08:55,705 --> 00:08:57,904
I need help.

160
00:08:57,944 --> 00:08:59,812
Now...

161
00:08:59,849 --> 00:09:02,253
are you in or out?

162
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:07,326
I'm in.

163
00:09:07,368 --> 00:09:09,567
My father used to say
that the road to hell

164
00:09:09,608 --> 00:09:12,046
is paved with good intentions.

165
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:16,414
I laid the first stone
right there.

166
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:19,595
I'd committed myself.

167
00:09:19,634 --> 00:09:22,733
I'd pay any price,
go to any lengths

168
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:25,043
because my cause was righteous.

169
00:09:26,485 --> 00:09:30,222
My... intentions were good.

170
00:09:31,933 --> 00:09:35,203
In the beginning,
that seemed like enough.

171
00:09:40,765 --> 00:09:43,397
If there's one thing
I've learned over the years

172
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:45,535
it's that bad news
invariably comes

173
00:09:45,577 --> 00:09:47,548
in the middle of the night.

174
00:09:47,616 --> 00:09:49,416
Kira to Captain Sisko.

175
00:09:51,593 --> 00:09:53,530
Go ahead, Major.

176
00:09:53,565 --> 00:09:55,433
We just received a priority one
communication

177
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,441
from Starfleet Command.

178
00:09:57,475 --> 00:09:59,446
The Dominion
has invaded Betazed.

179
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:05,552
According to initial reports,
the invasion force

180
00:10:05,596 --> 00:10:08,194
must have come from somewhere
in the Calandra Sector.

181
00:10:08,237 --> 00:10:11,177
Did Starfleet Intelligence
know anything about the buildup?

182
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,512
No. They believed
Calandra was too far

183
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,453
from the Dominion supply lines
to be a threat.

184
00:10:15,488 --> 00:10:17,618
There's plenty of blame
to go around.

185
00:10:17,661 --> 00:10:20,099
The Tenth Fleet was supposed
to be protecting Betazed

186
00:10:20,134 --> 00:10:21,364
and its outlying colonies.

187
00:10:21,404 --> 00:10:24,172
But it was caught out of
position on a training exercise.

188
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:26,775
What's worse, Betazed's
own defense systems

189
00:10:26,818 --> 00:10:28,082
are obsolete and undermanned.

190
00:10:28,121 --> 00:10:31,654
The planet was theirs
in less than ten hours.

191
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,063
With Betazed in the hands

192
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,504
of the Jem'Hadar,
the Dominion is in a position

193
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,482
to threaten Vulcan,
Andor, Tellar, Alpha Centauri.

194
00:10:39,518 --> 00:10:43,255
If we ever needed a new ally,
it's right now.

195
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:51,878
Mr. Garak.

196
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,146
It's been three days.

197
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:54,712
Have you made any progress?

198
00:10:54,824 --> 00:10:57,296
Well, I suppose that depends
on how you look at it.

199
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,594
This is how I look at it:

200
00:10:58,634 --> 00:11:00,730
Betazed has just fallen
to the Dominion

201
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:02,368
and we need to get
this operation underway.

202
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,848
I share your desire
for swift action, Captain.

203
00:11:04,883 --> 00:11:07,117
In fact,
after our last conversation

204
00:11:07,156 --> 00:11:10,187
I made a few discreet inquiries
among my former associates

205
00:11:10,231 --> 00:11:11,861
still living on Cardassia.

206
00:11:11,901 --> 00:11:13,200
As I anticipated

207
00:11:13,238 --> 00:11:16,303
they shared my loathing
for the current government

208
00:11:16,346 --> 00:11:18,374
and were willing to take on
any assignment

209
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:20,287
aimed at its destruction.

210
00:11:20,324 --> 00:11:22,056
That sounds like progress to me.

211
00:11:22,095 --> 00:11:23,064
Doesn't it?

212
00:11:23,097 --> 00:11:26,003
Unfortunately,
they're all dead now.

213
00:11:26,038 --> 00:11:27,007
What?

214
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,305
Yes.

215
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:31,285
All killed within one day
of speaking with me.

216
00:11:31,318 --> 00:11:33,380
I suppose that's a testament

217
00:11:33,424 --> 00:11:35,896
to the effectiveness
of Dominion Security.

218
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:38,928
One should admire
such efficiency.

219
00:11:38,972 --> 00:11:40,032
Oh.

220
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,569
I'm sorry.

221
00:11:42,614 --> 00:11:44,608
I hope you're not
giving up that easily.

222
00:11:44,654 --> 00:11:48,095
After all, the stakes
are much higher

223
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:49,530
than a few dead operatives.

224
00:11:49,565 --> 00:11:53,063
The fate of the entire Quadrant
hangs in the balance...

225
00:11:53,108 --> 00:11:56,572
or at least that's the case
you made to me.

226
00:11:56,618 --> 00:11:58,110
Do you have another plan?

227
00:11:58,155 --> 00:12:01,927
As a matter of fact, I do

228
00:12:01,964 --> 00:12:05,029
but I suspect
you won't like it.

229
00:12:05,073 --> 00:12:06,269
Try me.

230
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,577
If you want to guarantee
that we obtain evidence

231
00:12:08,615 --> 00:12:11,110
of a Dominion plot to attack
the Romulans

232
00:12:11,155 --> 00:12:16,966
I suggest that we manufacture
that evidence ourselves.

233
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,099
Maybe I should have put a stop
to it right there.

234
00:12:19,143 --> 00:12:20,203
Maybe I should have said

235
00:12:20,246 --> 00:12:22,514
"Thank you very much
for your input, Mr. Garak.

236
00:12:22,551 --> 00:12:25,046
I will take your suggestion
under advisement"

237
00:12:25,091 --> 00:12:27,825
and gone back to my office
and forgotten the whole thing

238
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:29,665
but I didn't...

239
00:12:29,704 --> 00:12:35,049
because in my heart, I knew
what he was saying made sense.

240
00:12:35,084 --> 00:12:36,850
His name is Vreenak.

241
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,851
He's been a key member

242
00:12:39,963 --> 00:12:42,162
of the Romulan Senate
for the past 14 years.

243
00:12:42,203 --> 00:12:44,607
He's Secretary
of the War Plans Council

244
00:12:44,642 --> 00:12:46,043
Vice Chairman of the Tal Shiar

245
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,885
and one of the most trusted
advisors to Proconsul Neral.

246
00:12:49,989 --> 00:12:51,721
He's also the man
that negotiated

247
00:12:51,761 --> 00:12:54,097
the nonaggression pact
with the Dominion.

248
00:12:54,134 --> 00:12:55,501
Since you're familiar with him

249
00:12:55,537 --> 00:12:57,303
I'll skip the rest
of his biography.

250
00:12:57,342 --> 00:13:00,510
What's important is that he
continues to be one of the most

251
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,352
ardently pro-Dominion voices
in the Senate.

252
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:06,296
If we can convince him
that the Dominion is a threat

253
00:13:06,332 --> 00:13:08,360
the rest of the Senate
will follow.

254
00:13:08,403 --> 00:13:10,340
All right. How?

255
00:13:10,376 --> 00:13:11,402
Ten days from now

256
00:13:11,445 --> 00:13:14,213
Senator Vreenak will be
making a trip to Soukara

257
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:16,417
for a diplomatic
meeting with Weyoun.

258
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,896
I am certain
that he can be persuaded

259
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,301
to make a secret detour to DS9

260
00:13:21,337 --> 00:13:25,302
if he were invited
by one Captain Benjamin Sisko.

261
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,683
How do you know
he'll be visiting Soukara?

262
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,284
There are some things
I'd rather not discuss.

263
00:13:30,327 --> 00:13:31,455
May I continue?

264
00:13:31,497 --> 00:13:32,557
Please.

265
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,072
When Senator Vreenak arrives,
you will show him

266
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,738
a holographic recording
of a secret meeting

267
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,774
held at the highest
level of the Dominion

268
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,587
in which the planned
invasion of Romulus

269
00:13:42,626 --> 00:13:43,925
is being discussed.

270
00:13:43,963 --> 00:13:44,954
You will tell the Senator

271
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,060
that this information
was obtained

272
00:13:47,104 --> 00:13:48,802
through various covert means

273
00:13:48,842 --> 00:13:50,779
at great cost
to the Federation.

274
00:13:50,814 --> 00:13:53,252
At least ten good
men lost their lives

275
00:13:53,287 --> 00:13:55,725
bringing it across the line...
that sort of thing.

276
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,994
He will immediately
suspect it's a forgery

277
00:13:58,066 --> 00:13:59,160
but you will assure him

278
00:13:59,203 --> 00:14:01,265
that such a thing
would be impossible.

279
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:02,402
"You see, Senator

280
00:14:02,444 --> 00:14:05,042
"this is an official Cardassian
transcript.

281
00:14:05,084 --> 00:14:08,456
"It was recorded on a one-time
optolythic data rod

282
00:14:08,493 --> 00:14:10,361
"used for official
record keeping.

283
00:14:10,398 --> 00:14:12,927
"These rods are manufactured
only as needed

284
00:14:12,972 --> 00:14:14,441
"on Cardassia Prime.

285
00:14:14,475 --> 00:14:17,175
"Information can only be
transcribed on them once

286
00:14:17,215 --> 00:14:19,483
and then cannot be altered."

287
00:14:19,522 --> 00:14:21,117
He'll want to examine it.

288
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,151
Of course.

289
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,394
And he will discover,
to his amazement

290
00:14:24,435 --> 00:14:28,343
that it is completely genuine,
at least, so it will appear.

291
00:14:28,378 --> 00:14:30,144
But in reality?

292
00:14:30,183 --> 00:14:32,951
You will have handed him
a genuine optolythic data rod

293
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,396
but it will contain one
of the most perfect forgeries

294
00:14:36,432 --> 00:14:37,958
ever fashioned.

295
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,373
I'm still working
on obtaining the data rod

296
00:14:40,409 --> 00:14:44,044
but I have found the man who
will create the holo-recording.

297
00:14:44,085 --> 00:14:46,957
You realize I can't authorize
a thing like this on my own.

298
00:14:46,993 --> 00:14:48,691
I have to clear it
with Starfleet Command.

299
00:14:48,731 --> 00:14:51,967
Of course, but I suspect
that with the fall of Betazed

300
00:14:52,006 --> 00:14:54,068
they'll be ready to do
whatever it takes

301
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:56,413
to bring the Romulans
into the war.

302
00:15:00,161 --> 00:15:01,791
I'll let you know.

303
00:15:01,832 --> 00:15:03,530
Uh, one last thing, Captain.

304
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,511
The man we need to forge
this holo-program

305
00:15:07,547 --> 00:15:09,450
is currently sitting
in a Klingon prison

306
00:15:09,485 --> 00:15:10,579
awaiting execution.

307
00:15:10,621 --> 00:15:13,355
To save time
and, incidentally, his life

308
00:15:13,395 --> 00:15:15,731
I thought that perhaps
you could contact

309
00:15:15,768 --> 00:15:19,266
Chancellor Gowron today
and arrange a pardon?

310
00:15:19,311 --> 00:15:20,780
What's his name?

311
00:15:20,814 --> 00:15:23,082
Grathon Tolar.

312
00:15:23,154 --> 00:15:27,655
I cannot tell you
how grateful I am, Captain.

313
00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:31,105
The Klingons were going
to execute me tomorrow.

314
00:15:31,174 --> 00:15:33,304
Of course, they say
that every day.

315
00:15:33,347 --> 00:15:35,443
It's one of the little
games they like to play.

316
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:39,117
You do understand the terms
of your parole.

317
00:15:39,195 --> 00:15:40,528
Oh, yes.

318
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:43,802
I have to promise to stay
away from the Klingon Empire.

319
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:46,005
That'll be tough.

320
00:15:47,082 --> 00:15:48,381
And I have to create

321
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:53,262
some kind of a special
holo-program for you.

322
00:15:54,368 --> 00:15:55,667
Well, I can hardly wait.

323
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,075
I've never worked
for Starfleet before.

324
00:15:58,111 --> 00:15:59,979
Let's be very clear about this.

325
00:16:00,016 --> 00:16:02,078
You're not working
for Starfleet.

326
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:04,525
This entire matter
is off the record.

327
00:16:04,561 --> 00:16:07,626
As far as you're concerned,
you're working for me.

328
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:09,401
Oh, a personal matter.

329
00:16:10,711 --> 00:16:13,981
Something special,
for your eyes only?

330
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:16,013
Something with, perhaps

331
00:16:16,057 --> 00:16:20,090
five or six Orion slave girls
and... oh...

332
00:16:20,135 --> 00:16:21,126
Mr. Tolar.

333
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:24,771
I suggest you go
and wait in your quarters.

334
00:16:24,813 --> 00:16:26,305
Mr. Garak will provide you
with all

335
00:16:26,351 --> 00:16:27,911
the information you need.

336
00:16:27,955 --> 00:16:30,450
Garak... is here?

337
00:16:30,495 --> 00:16:32,159
That's right.

338
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,001
Oh... oh...

339
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,005
Well... that's different.

340
00:16:41,857 --> 00:16:44,193
I'll wait in my quarters.

341
00:16:46,202 --> 00:16:47,364
Why I didn't listen

342
00:16:47,405 --> 00:16:49,069
to the voice
in the back of my mind

343
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,240
telling me not to believe
a word he said

344
00:16:51,316 --> 00:16:52,580
I'll never know.

345
00:16:52,619 --> 00:16:55,251
But it didn't take long
for me to come face-to-face

346
00:16:55,326 --> 00:16:58,198
with the fact
that I'd made a mistake.

347
00:16:58,234 --> 00:17:00,137
Odo to the Captain.

348
00:17:00,172 --> 00:17:01,505
Go ahead, Constable.

349
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:02,806
I'm sorry to disturb you

350
00:17:02,846 --> 00:17:05,375
but do you know a man
named Grathon Tolar?

351
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:07,117
Yes. Why do you ask?

352
00:17:07,157 --> 00:17:09,652
Because he just tried
to kill Quark.

353
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:19,633
Sit still, Quark.
You'll be fine.

354
00:17:21,312 --> 00:17:23,146
All right, keep an eye on him.

355
00:17:24,755 --> 00:17:26,156
What happened?

356
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:29,656
As I understand it, Mr. Tolar
over there came in

357
00:17:29,701 --> 00:17:30,761
about two hours ago

358
00:17:30,804 --> 00:17:32,068
ordered a bottle
of Whelan bitters.

359
00:17:32,108 --> 00:17:35,549
15 minutes later,
he ordered a second bottle

360
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,109
and then a third.

361
00:17:37,154 --> 00:17:38,784
Halfway through
his fourth bottle

362
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:42,060
he decided to dance
with M'Pella.

363
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,436
She was otherwise
engaged, running

364
00:17:44,472 --> 00:17:46,443
the dabo wheel,
declined his invitation.

365
00:17:46,478 --> 00:17:48,346
He decided to force the issue.

366
00:17:48,383 --> 00:17:52,827
A brief struggle ensued,
and Quark

367
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,459
in an uncharacteristic
display of chivalry

368
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:59,204
attempted to intervene,
so Tolar stabbed him.

369
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,804
Normally, he'd be

370
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:02,945
sitting in a holding
cell, but he claims

371
00:18:02,987 --> 00:18:04,651
he's a friend of yours.

372
00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:06,218
He's no friend of mine...

373
00:18:06,262 --> 00:18:08,096
but he is working for me.

374
00:18:08,134 --> 00:18:10,298
It's an extremely
sensitive matter

375
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,334
concerning Federation security.

376
00:18:12,378 --> 00:18:15,750
I can't have any record
of him being on the station.

377
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,850
I see.

378
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,794
I am certainly aware
of the need

379
00:18:21,836 --> 00:18:24,708
for special security measures
during wartime

380
00:18:24,744 --> 00:18:26,578
but, as a matter of law

381
00:18:26,616 --> 00:18:30,353
if Quark chooses
to press charges against Tolar

382
00:18:30,392 --> 00:18:33,126
I have no choice
but to make an arrest.

383
00:18:33,165 --> 00:18:34,657
May I speak to Quark?

384
00:18:38,913 --> 00:18:39,882
How is he?

385
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:40,885
How do I look?

386
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,890
I'm a man who just
had a brush with death.

387
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,052
He'll be fine.

388
00:18:44,094 --> 00:18:46,224
His ribs deflected the knife
from his major organs.

389
00:18:46,266 --> 00:18:47,758
Bleeding was superficial.

390
00:18:47,804 --> 00:18:48,898
Superficial?

391
00:18:48,939 --> 00:18:51,377
Do you know how much
this shirt cost?

392
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:53,647
Will you excuse us
for a moment, Doctor?

393
00:18:53,686 --> 00:18:54,950
I'll check on you tomorrow.

394
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:03,469
Do you intend to press charges?

395
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:05,243
You bet I do.

396
00:19:05,283 --> 00:19:08,121
What will it take, um...

397
00:19:09,994 --> 00:19:12,728
to, uh, convince you otherwise?

398
00:19:12,768 --> 00:19:14,864
Are you offering me...

399
00:19:14,907 --> 00:19:16,069
a bribe?

400
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,654
I knew it.

401
00:19:21,692 --> 00:19:24,564
Captain, I've always liked you.

402
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:27,094
I suspected that somewhere deep
down in your heart of hearts

403
00:19:27,139 --> 00:19:29,201
there was a tiny bit of Ferengi
just waiting to get out.

404
00:19:29,245 --> 00:19:30,475
What's your price?

405
00:19:30,515 --> 00:19:34,355
Well... let's start
with replacing my clothes

406
00:19:34,391 --> 00:19:35,519
and M'Pella's clothes.

407
00:19:35,561 --> 00:19:36,894
All right.

408
00:19:36,931 --> 00:19:38,868
I'm not finished.

409
00:19:38,903 --> 00:19:41,501
I think I should be compensated

410
00:19:41,543 --> 00:19:43,571
for the loss of business
I suffered today

411
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:47,614
which I calculate
as no less than...

412
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:51,065
five bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

413
00:19:52,805 --> 00:19:54,001
Done.

414
00:19:54,042 --> 00:19:58,007
I'm also having a problem
with Station Security.

415
00:19:58,086 --> 00:20:01,458
They're holding
some cargo containers

416
00:20:01,495 --> 00:20:02,691
which I've been waiting for

417
00:20:02,731 --> 00:20:06,868
because of some missing
import license or something.

418
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:08,139
I'll handle it.

419
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:09,979
A-anything else?

420
00:20:10,017 --> 00:20:10,986
No.

421
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:15,157
I think we can call it a bribe.

422
00:20:15,197 --> 00:20:17,065
And thank you, Captain.

423
00:20:17,135 --> 00:20:21,511
Thank you for restoring my faith
in the 98th Rule of Acquisition.

424
00:20:21,547 --> 00:20:24,749
"Every man has his price."

425
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:33,502
That was my first moment
of real doubt...

426
00:20:33,545 --> 00:20:36,109
when I started to wonder...

427
00:20:36,218 --> 00:20:39,522
if this whole thing
was a mistake.

428
00:20:42,267 --> 00:20:45,241
So then I went back
to my office...

429
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:49,148
and there...

430
00:20:49,186 --> 00:20:53,289
was a new casualty list
waiting for me.

431
00:20:56,537 --> 00:21:00,913
People are dying
out there every day!

432
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,919
Entire worlds are struggling
for their freedom

433
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,592
and here I am, still worrying

434
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:10,607
about the finer points
of morality.

435
00:21:10,641 --> 00:21:15,244
No, I... I had to keep my eye
on the ball.

436
00:21:15,286 --> 00:21:17,485
Winning the war,
stopping the bloodshed...

437
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,656
those were the priorities!

438
00:21:19,698 --> 00:21:21,430
So I pushed on

439
00:21:21,469 --> 00:21:23,440
and every time another doubt
appeared before me

440
00:21:23,474 --> 00:21:26,346
I just found another way
to shove it aside.

441
00:21:26,382 --> 00:21:28,478
Mind if I join you?

442
00:21:29,657 --> 00:21:30,819
Be my guest.

443
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:36,033
Ops.

444
00:21:36,073 --> 00:21:37,474
Hold. The less I'm seen

445
00:21:37,511 --> 00:21:39,505
parading through Ops,
the better.

446
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:41,213
I couldn't agree more.

447
00:21:41,321 --> 00:21:42,881
You seem angry.

448
00:21:42,924 --> 00:21:44,519
Who's watching Tolar?

449
00:21:44,562 --> 00:21:45,997
I've locked him in his quarters.

450
00:21:46,032 --> 00:21:48,128
I've also left him
with the distinct impression

451
00:21:48,172 --> 00:21:50,075
that if he attempts
to force the door open

452
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,206
it may explode.

453
00:21:52,249 --> 00:21:53,582
I hope that's
just an impression.

454
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:57,060
It's best not to dwell
on such minutiae.

455
00:21:57,095 --> 00:22:00,867
In any case, we have far more
important matters to discuss.

456
00:22:00,905 --> 00:22:03,069
I've located a gentleman
willing to sell us

457
00:22:03,111 --> 00:22:05,777
a genuine optolythic data rod.

458
00:22:05,818 --> 00:22:07,219
How do you know it's genuine?

459
00:22:07,288 --> 00:22:09,384
I trust the source,
but rest assured

460
00:22:09,427 --> 00:22:11,922
I will confirm
the rod's authenticity

461
00:22:11,967 --> 00:22:15,773
before I make payment,
which brings me to you.

462
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,245
How much does he want?

463
00:22:17,314 --> 00:22:20,881
I'm afraid he's not
interested in latinum.

464
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,553
The gentleman in question

465
00:22:22,595 --> 00:22:25,067
has requested
to be compensated with...

466
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:29,101
200 liters of biomimetic gel.

467
00:22:29,144 --> 00:22:30,272
What?!

468
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,547
I don't know why, exactly.

469
00:22:32,587 --> 00:22:34,581
One would assume
it has something to do

470
00:22:34,626 --> 00:22:36,186
with genetic experimentation.

471
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,825
Offer him something else.

472
00:22:37,867 --> 00:22:40,066
Believe me, I wouldn't
be relaying this request

473
00:22:40,107 --> 00:22:42,636
if I thought
he'd take something else.

474
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,711
Biomimetic gel is strictly
controlled by the Federation

475
00:22:45,755 --> 00:22:47,749
and not for sale at any price.

476
00:22:47,793 --> 00:22:50,665
Find someone else
who's willing to sell us a rod.

477
00:22:50,701 --> 00:22:51,863
I wasn't exaggerating

478
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,172
when I told you
about the near impossibility

479
00:22:54,209 --> 00:22:57,707
of obtaining a genuine
Cardassian data rod.

480
00:22:57,752 --> 00:22:59,347
It's something
of a minor miracle

481
00:22:59,424 --> 00:23:01,760
that I was able
to locate this one source.

482
00:23:01,796 --> 00:23:05,260
I'm virtually certain
I won't find another.

483
00:23:05,305 --> 00:23:08,872
I'm afraid we either
give him what he wants

484
00:23:08,915 --> 00:23:12,789
or forget the whole enterprise.

485
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:15,955
Then let's forget about it.

486
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,991
Ops.

487
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,073
Hold.

488
00:23:20,111 --> 00:23:22,345
200 liters is
out of the question.

489
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:26,324
There's not that much gel
in the entire sector.

490
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,895
I believe that the quantity
is open to negotiation.

491
00:23:36,085 --> 00:23:38,284
Ops.

492
00:23:38,324 --> 00:23:39,520
Captain, biomimetic gel

493
00:23:39,561 --> 00:23:41,589
is an extremely dangerous
compound, as you know.

494
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:43,501
I can't release it
without at least some idea

495
00:23:43,538 --> 00:23:44,507
of where it's going.

496
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:46,033
In the wrong hands,
it could be used

497
00:23:46,078 --> 00:23:48,710
to make biogenic weapons,
or for illegal

498
00:23:48,751 --> 00:23:50,722
replication experiments or to
develop organic explosives...

499
00:23:50,757 --> 00:23:52,694
Perhaps I didn't
make myself clear, Doctor.

500
00:23:52,728 --> 00:23:54,858
This is not a request;
it's an order.

501
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,338
You will package
85 liters of biomimetic gel

502
00:23:57,373 --> 00:24:00,871
for interstellar transport,
and deliver them to Cargo Bay 3.

503
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:02,180
Is that understood?

504
00:24:03,122 --> 00:24:04,752
Yes.

505
00:24:04,793 --> 00:24:07,322
I'd like this order
in writing, please, sir.

506
00:24:11,109 --> 00:24:12,773
I thought you might.

507
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,415
You should know
that I shall note this in my log

508
00:24:17,492 --> 00:24:20,398
and file an official protest
with Starfleet Medical.

509
00:24:20,433 --> 00:24:22,427
That is your right,
but I want the gel

510
00:24:22,472 --> 00:24:23,668
by the end of the day.

511
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:24,699
Dismissed.

512
00:24:30,942 --> 00:24:32,104
The Founders have decided

513
00:24:32,145 --> 00:24:34,879
to implement stage two
ahead of schedule.

514
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:36,719
The invasion of Romulus?

515
00:24:36,757 --> 00:24:38,785
It's too soon.

516
00:24:38,829 --> 00:24:40,595
We're engaged in heavy fighting

517
00:24:40,634 --> 00:24:42,628
all along the border
with the Federation.

518
00:24:42,672 --> 00:24:44,700
The Klingons are preparing
to go on the offensive, and...

519
00:24:44,745 --> 00:24:45,771
Fortunately, the Founders

520
00:24:45,814 --> 00:24:47,512
have better vision than you do.

521
00:24:47,551 --> 00:24:49,921
They can see the opportunities
before us

522
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:51,222
even when you cannot.

523
00:24:51,261 --> 00:24:53,665
Consider...

524
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:58,042
the Romulans don't expect
an attack from Cardassia.

525
00:24:58,146 --> 00:25:01,211
The bulk of the Romulan fleet
is still deployed

526
00:25:01,254 --> 00:25:03,590
along the Neutral Zone
with the Federation.

527
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,225
The Founders estimate
we could be on Romulus itself

528
00:25:06,267 --> 00:25:07,999
in less than three weeks.

529
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:09,507
Three weeks?

530
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:11,513
I heard
the same kind of estimates

531
00:25:11,548 --> 00:25:13,519
before we attacked
the Federation.

532
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:14,783
Those plans were ruined

533
00:25:14,823 --> 00:25:17,352
by the incompetency
of your predecessor.

534
00:25:17,396 --> 00:25:19,390
Gul Dukat is a great man.

535
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:22,431
Gul Dukat is a preening egotist
and a fool.

536
00:25:22,476 --> 00:25:23,945
We offered him
unchallenged control

537
00:25:23,979 --> 00:25:25,539
of the Alpha Quadrant, and all

538
00:25:25,584 --> 00:25:27,646
he could think about
was his daughter.

539
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:35,835
Now, shall we get back
to the business at hand?

540
00:25:35,877 --> 00:25:36,846
That's it.

541
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,247
Freeze program.

542
00:25:40,489 --> 00:25:41,958
That's all the new material.

543
00:25:41,993 --> 00:25:45,024
The rest of the program plays
exactly as you saw before.

544
00:25:45,067 --> 00:25:46,297
What do you think?

545
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:48,467
It's, uh, better.

546
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,843
They seem more real.

547
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,874
Yes, and all I had to do
was add

548
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,687
a little petty bickering
and mutual loathing.

549
00:25:54,726 --> 00:25:57,221
So, you are happy.

550
00:25:58,436 --> 00:26:01,136
It's... satisfactory.

551
00:26:01,176 --> 00:26:04,514
You may record the program
onto the data rod now.

552
00:26:09,431 --> 00:26:11,595
I received a message.

553
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:13,699
Senator Vreenak is on the way.

554
00:26:13,742 --> 00:26:14,733
Excellent.

555
00:26:18,889 --> 00:26:19,858
Done.

556
00:26:21,763 --> 00:26:23,393
Who gets it?

557
00:26:23,433 --> 00:26:27,877
Just... put it in the case.

558
00:26:27,913 --> 00:26:28,882
Ah.

559
00:26:34,897 --> 00:26:38,338
Well... it has been a pleasure

560
00:26:38,372 --> 00:26:40,776
doing business
with you gentlemen.

561
00:26:40,812 --> 00:26:42,304
Call me again if you ever...

562
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,945
You're not going anywhere.

563
00:26:43,987 --> 00:26:46,425
What?
What do you mean?

564
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,861
I mean, you're not leaving

565
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:50,770
until your work is accepted
by our client.

566
00:26:50,805 --> 00:26:52,365
Well, that isn't fair.

567
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:54,505
You can't keep me here
against my will.

568
00:26:54,548 --> 00:26:56,212
I haven't done anything wrong.

569
00:26:56,286 --> 00:26:58,724
We had an agreement!

570
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:00,228
I'm making a new agreement.

571
00:27:00,329 --> 00:27:03,394
If that program passes
inspection, you walk free

572
00:27:03,437 --> 00:27:06,275
but if there is even
the slightest flaw

573
00:27:06,312 --> 00:27:09,046
then I will send you back
to that Klingon prison

574
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:12,686
and tell Gowron to take his
time while he executes you.

575
00:27:12,728 --> 00:27:15,200
All right. It will pass.

576
00:27:15,268 --> 00:27:16,328
You'll see.

577
00:27:17,608 --> 00:27:20,878
It... will... pass.

578
00:27:20,916 --> 00:27:22,887
I sincerely hope so.

579
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:25,655
Now, why don't you go back
to your quarters?

580
00:27:25,695 --> 00:27:29,535
I'll be along shortly
to say... hello.

581
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:43,733
Maybe I was under more pressure
than I realized.

582
00:27:43,776 --> 00:27:46,340
Maybe it was really starting
to get to me.

583
00:27:47,953 --> 00:27:51,052
But I was off the hook.

584
00:27:51,094 --> 00:27:55,299
Starfleet Command had given
the plan their blessing

585
00:27:55,405 --> 00:27:58,207
and I thought
that would make things easier.

586
00:28:02,157 --> 00:28:06,601
But I was the one
who had to make it happen.

587
00:28:06,635 --> 00:28:13,210
I was the one who had to look
Senator Vreenak in his eye...

588
00:28:13,252 --> 00:28:16,693
and convince him that a lie...

589
00:28:16,727 --> 00:28:18,891
was the truth.

590
00:28:18,934 --> 00:28:22,272
So while you're entertaining
the Senator in the Wardroom

591
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:23,278
I'll take the opportunity

592
00:28:23,312 --> 00:28:24,872
to make a quick search
of his ship's database.

593
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:25,942
For what?

594
00:28:25,985 --> 00:28:27,511
Well, for any intelligence
information

595
00:28:27,556 --> 00:28:30,120
he may have picked up
on the Dominion in Soukara.

596
00:28:30,163 --> 00:28:31,462
What if you get caught?

597
00:28:31,499 --> 00:28:32,695
Oh, I think
that's highly unlikely.

598
00:28:32,736 --> 00:28:34,707
I doubt the Senator
will be traveling

599
00:28:34,741 --> 00:28:37,077
with more than four bodyguards
at the most.

600
00:28:37,114 --> 00:28:39,348
Two will stand watch
outside the Wardroom

601
00:28:39,387 --> 00:28:41,358
and two will stay
in the landing bay.

602
00:28:41,459 --> 00:28:44,831
I assure you, they'll never know
I was even near their ship.

603
00:28:44,867 --> 00:28:47,465
Just make sure
you don't get caught.

604
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,990
Report.

605
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,694
Sections 52 Baker
through 62 Baker

606
00:28:57,734 --> 00:28:58,760
have been secured.

607
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:01,368
I have posted armed guards
at every entry point

608
00:29:01,411 --> 00:29:03,645
and I have personally scanned
all compartments

609
00:29:03,683 --> 00:29:05,152
for signs
of surveillance equipment.

610
00:29:05,187 --> 00:29:06,554
Very good, Commander.

611
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:10,293
Maintain current security
measures until further notice.

612
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:13,365
No one is to enter this area
except Mr. Garak and myself.

613
00:29:13,408 --> 00:29:14,377
Aye, sir.

614
00:29:14,411 --> 00:29:16,177
Always a pleasure
to see you, Mr. Worf.

615
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,389
Ops to Captain Sisko.

616
00:29:21,496 --> 00:29:22,522
Go ahead, Major.

617
00:29:22,566 --> 00:29:24,594
We've just received
the coded subspace signal

618
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:25,799
you were waiting for.

619
00:29:25,841 --> 00:29:26,810
Should I reply?

620
00:29:26,843 --> 00:29:28,403
No reply, Major.

621
00:29:28,447 --> 00:29:29,473
Sisko out.

622
00:30:11,325 --> 00:30:13,797
I'll take my leave of you now,
Captain.

623
00:30:13,831 --> 00:30:15,825
Oh, and one last thing.

624
00:30:15,871 --> 00:30:18,343
Vreenak believes
he's on the winning side

625
00:30:18,377 --> 00:30:20,541
so until you can prove otherwise

626
00:30:20,616 --> 00:30:23,715
you may have to put up
with a certain...

627
00:30:23,757 --> 00:30:24,726
acerbic attitude.

628
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,127
Uh, Mr. Garak

629
00:30:26,163 --> 00:30:28,431
after having spent
a week with you

630
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:32,071
I have developed
a very, very thick skin.

631
00:30:32,113 --> 00:30:34,084
Good luck.

632
00:30:46,517 --> 00:30:48,181
Welcome aboard, Senator.

633
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,954
I'm Captain Benjamin Sisko.

634
00:30:50,995 --> 00:30:55,770
So, you're the Commander
of Deep Space 9...

635
00:30:55,808 --> 00:30:57,904
and the Emissary
to the Prophets

636
00:30:57,946 --> 00:31:02,413
decorated combat officer,
widower, father, mentor.

637
00:31:02,458 --> 00:31:04,088
And, oh, yes...

638
00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:06,624
the man who started the war
with the Dominion.

639
00:31:08,139 --> 00:31:10,269
Somehow I thought
you'd be taller.

640
00:31:10,312 --> 00:31:11,781
Sorry to disappoint you.

641
00:31:11,815 --> 00:31:12,977
To be honest

642
00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:16,118
my opinion of Starfleet officers
is so low

643
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,962
you'd have to work very hard
indeed to disappoint me.

644
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:21,873
If you'll come with me,
I'll show you to your quarters.

645
00:31:21,908 --> 00:31:23,902
I look forward
to seeing your station...

646
00:31:23,946 --> 00:31:25,644
while it's still here, that is.

647
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:28,384
The way the war's going
with the Federation

648
00:31:28,426 --> 00:31:30,294
it may not be around
much longer.

649
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:42,023
Mmm.

650
00:31:42,062 --> 00:31:44,432
A fair approximation, but...

651
00:31:44,468 --> 00:31:47,168
somewhat lacking in aroma.

652
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:51,482
Real <i>kali-fal</i> should forcibly
open one's sinuses

653
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,514
well before the first sip.

654
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:55,359
We don't have much experience

655
00:31:55,397 --> 00:31:57,801
in replicating
Romulan beverages.

656
00:31:57,837 --> 00:32:00,001
Of course, all of that
would change

657
00:32:00,042 --> 00:32:03,278
if we became allies
instead of cold warriors.

658
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,018
You are persistent, Captain.

659
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:07,424
I'll grant you that.

660
00:32:07,461 --> 00:32:10,025
But dogged determination
isn't enough

661
00:32:10,101 --> 00:32:12,733
to change the reality
of your situation.

662
00:32:12,776 --> 00:32:17,721
Time is definitely
not on your side.

663
00:32:17,754 --> 00:32:19,554
The Dominion shipyards
are operating

664
00:32:19,592 --> 00:32:21,152
at 100 percent capacity.

665
00:32:21,197 --> 00:32:23,726
Yours are still being rebuilt.

666
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:29,844
The Dominion is breeding legions
of Jem'Hadar soldiers every day.

667
00:32:29,886 --> 00:32:33,350
You're experiencing
a manpower shortage.

668
00:32:33,395 --> 00:32:35,924
But most important...

669
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:44,217
the Dominion is resolved
to win the war at any cost.

670
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,754
You and I both know

671
00:32:46,797 --> 00:32:49,737
the Federation has already
put out peace feelers.

672
00:32:49,772 --> 00:32:52,040
Now, in all candor

673
00:32:52,077 --> 00:32:55,415
if you were in my position,
which side would you choose?

674
00:32:55,453 --> 00:32:58,255
I'd pick the side
most likely to leave us in peace

675
00:32:58,293 --> 00:32:59,991
when the dust settles.

676
00:33:00,031 --> 00:33:02,697
Maybe you're right.

677
00:33:02,738 --> 00:33:05,644
Maybe the Dominion will win
in the end.

678
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,710
Then the Founders will control
what we now call Cardassia

679
00:33:08,754 --> 00:33:11,751
the Klingon Empire
and the Federation.

680
00:33:11,795 --> 00:33:14,928
So, instead of facing
three separate opponents

681
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:18,707
with three separate agendas,
you'll find yourselves facing

682
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,480
the same opponent on every side.

683
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,320
There's a word for that...

684
00:33:23,358 --> 00:33:24,953
surrounded.

685
00:33:26,032 --> 00:33:29,165
It really is a good replica.

686
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,406
The aroma's
starting to grow on me.

687
00:33:31,446 --> 00:33:33,680
For a moment there, I almost
forgot it wasn't the real thing

688
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:35,815
but only for a moment.

689
00:33:35,857 --> 00:33:39,127
You make
some very good points, Captain

690
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:42,768
but it's still
all speculation and theory...

691
00:33:42,808 --> 00:33:46,214
nothing that would warrant
abrogating our treaty

692
00:33:46,251 --> 00:33:48,381
and plunging the Empire
into war.

693
00:33:51,264 --> 00:33:53,235
What if I told you

694
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:56,141
that the Dominion
is planning a sneak attack

695
00:33:56,177 --> 00:33:59,208
on the Romulan Empire
at this very moment?

696
00:33:59,252 --> 00:34:02,226
Mmm...

697
00:34:02,259 --> 00:34:04,493
I'd want proof.

698
00:34:07,975 --> 00:34:09,809
And with the Cardassian
Fourth Order

699
00:34:09,846 --> 00:34:11,110
protecting their flank

700
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:13,747
the 23rd Jem'Hadar division
will begin its thrust

701
00:34:13,789 --> 00:34:15,555
across the Glintara Sector.

702
00:34:15,594 --> 00:34:17,758
They should begin
the invasion of Romulus

703
00:34:17,799 --> 00:34:19,234
on the following day.

704
00:34:19,337 --> 00:34:21,571
Once we've taken the homeworld

705
00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:23,239
organized resistance
will crumble

706
00:34:23,347 --> 00:34:25,250
when outlying
systems and colonies

707
00:34:25,286 --> 00:34:27,450
begin looking out
for themselves.

708
00:34:27,492 --> 00:34:29,052
Consolidation
of the entire empire

709
00:34:29,095 --> 00:34:30,496
will take three months at most.

710
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:31,832
What if the Romulan fleet

711
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,500
reacts faster
than you're anticipating?

712
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,907
What if they pull
all of their forces

713
00:34:34,944 --> 00:34:38,112
away from the Federation border
at the first sign of our attack?

714
00:34:38,153 --> 00:34:40,283
I place my faith
in the Founders.

715
00:34:40,325 --> 00:34:43,197
They say the Romulans
are not ready for war

716
00:34:43,232 --> 00:34:46,000
and will not react fast enough
once it begins.

717
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:49,309
Now, do you wish
to dispute their judgment?

718
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,884
No, of course not.

719
00:34:54,295 --> 00:34:57,326
I serve the Founders.

720
00:34:57,369 --> 00:34:59,203
As do we all.

721
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,006
Meeting adjourned.

722
00:35:07,596 --> 00:35:09,726
I'd like to examine...

723
00:35:09,768 --> 00:35:12,138
that data rod.

724
00:35:29,352 --> 00:35:32,885
So all I could do was wait...

725
00:35:32,928 --> 00:35:38,671
and see how masterful
Tolar's forgery really was.

726
00:35:42,419 --> 00:35:44,789
So I waited.

727
00:35:44,825 --> 00:35:48,061
Tried to catch up
on my paperwork.

728
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:55,108
But I-I found it very difficult
to focus on...

729
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:57,681
criminal activity reports, ha?

730
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:03,267
Cargo manifests.

731
00:36:03,307 --> 00:36:05,541
So I went back to pacing...

732
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:07,847
and staring out of the window.

733
00:36:12,698 --> 00:36:15,068
I'm not an impatient man.

734
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:20,846
I'm not one to agonize over
decisions once they're made.

735
00:36:20,886 --> 00:36:23,518
I got that from my father.

736
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:26,088
He always says...

737
00:36:26,132 --> 00:36:27,796
"Worry and doubt

738
00:36:27,837 --> 00:36:32,440
"are the greatest enemies
of a great chef.

739
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:37,587
"The soufflé will either rise
or it won't.

740
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:40,570
"There's not a damn thing
you can do about it

741
00:36:40,603 --> 00:36:43,475
"so you might as well
just sit back and wait

742
00:36:43,544 --> 00:36:45,515
and see what happens."

743
00:36:54,807 --> 00:36:56,471
But this time...

744
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,350
the cost of failure
was so high...

745
00:37:03,563 --> 00:37:06,469
I found it difficult
to take his advice.

746
00:37:06,538 --> 00:37:10,446
If Vreenak discovered that
the data rod was a forgery

747
00:37:10,481 --> 00:37:11,814
if he realized
that we were trying

748
00:37:11,851 --> 00:37:14,483
to trick them into the war,
it could push the Romulans

749
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:16,827
even farther
into the enemy camp.

750
00:37:16,864 --> 00:37:19,496
They could start
to openly help the Dominion.

751
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:21,098
If worse came to worst

752
00:37:21,142 --> 00:37:23,637
they could actually join
the war against us.

753
00:37:23,682 --> 00:37:25,151
I had the distinct feeling

754
00:37:25,186 --> 00:37:27,054
that victory or defeat
would be decided

755
00:37:27,091 --> 00:37:28,287
in the next few minutes.

756
00:37:39,256 --> 00:37:41,318
It's a fake!

757
00:37:49,549 --> 00:37:52,853
So, it all blew up in my face.

758
00:37:54,797 --> 00:37:59,799
And all the lies
and compromises...

759
00:37:59,843 --> 00:38:02,077
the inner doubts
and rationalizations...

760
00:38:02,116 --> 00:38:04,384
all for nothing.

761
00:38:04,421 --> 00:38:08,022
Vreenak was furious.

762
00:38:08,064 --> 00:38:10,228
I can't say I blamed him.

763
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,366
I'd have reacted the same way.

764
00:38:15,049 --> 00:38:17,544
After telling me
in no uncertain terms

765
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:20,289
that he would expose
this "vile deception"

766
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,301
to the entire Alpha Quadrant

767
00:38:22,335 --> 00:38:25,309
he got back in his shuttle
and headed home.

768
00:38:27,481 --> 00:38:30,387
There didn't seem
to be anything more to do.

769
00:38:30,423 --> 00:38:32,622
So, I went back to work.

770
00:38:32,661 --> 00:38:35,499
Two days later, I got the news.

771
00:38:39,312 --> 00:38:40,645
No one for me today.

772
00:38:40,682 --> 00:38:41,742
I had one.

773
00:38:41,785 --> 00:38:43,551
Maria Tatalia,
wounded in action.

774
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,254
Friend?

775
00:38:45,295 --> 00:38:46,696
Friend of a friend.

776
00:38:46,731 --> 00:38:47,961
Actually, I only met her once.

777
00:38:48,001 --> 00:38:49,699
I don't think she'd remember me.

778
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:51,710
Friend of a friend
between the two of us.

779
00:38:51,744 --> 00:38:53,476
Well, I know
it sounds a bit strange

780
00:38:53,516 --> 00:38:56,011
but I'd say we're off
to a pretty good start today.

781
00:38:56,056 --> 00:38:57,491
Captain, we just received word

782
00:38:57,526 --> 00:39:00,226
from Starfleet Intelligence
that a Romulan shuttlecraft

783
00:39:00,266 --> 00:39:03,138
carrying a high-ranking Senator
has just been destroyed.

784
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,143
Which Senator?

785
00:39:04,177 --> 00:39:05,669
Senator Vreenak.

786
00:39:05,714 --> 00:39:07,309
He was returning to Romulus

787
00:39:07,352 --> 00:39:09,482
from a diplomatic mission
to Soukara

788
00:39:09,524 --> 00:39:10,618
when his shuttle exploded.

789
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,292
The Tal Shiar are investigating

790
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:15,304
but preliminary reports
point to sabotage.

791
00:39:15,339 --> 00:39:18,438
They believe that the Dominion
is responsible.

792
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:22,514
The Dominion assassinated
a Romulan Senator.

793
00:39:22,558 --> 00:39:24,392
On a diplomatic mission.

794
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:26,127
That changes everything.

795
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:29,403
It could even bring the Romulans
into the war.

796
00:39:30,612 --> 00:39:32,640
Excuse me.

797
00:39:52,402 --> 00:39:53,598
Get up!

798
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:56,203
You killed him!

799
00:39:56,245 --> 00:39:56,974
That's right.

800
00:39:57,014 --> 00:39:57,983
That's what you

801
00:39:58,017 --> 00:39:59,316
planned to do all along,
isn't it?

802
00:39:59,353 --> 00:40:01,347
You knew the data rod
wouldn't hold up to scrutiny.

803
00:40:01,392 --> 00:40:03,488
You just wanted
to get him on the station

804
00:40:03,531 --> 00:40:05,161
so that you could plant a bomb
on his shuttle!

805
00:40:05,201 --> 00:40:06,727
It wasn't quite that simple.

806
00:40:06,773 --> 00:40:10,009
I did have hopes that the rod
would somehow pass inspection

807
00:40:10,048 --> 00:40:11,483
but I suspected that Tolar

808
00:40:11,518 --> 00:40:13,284
may not have been
up to the task.

809
00:40:13,323 --> 00:40:15,487
And what about Tolar?
Did you kill him, too?!

810
00:40:15,529 --> 00:40:19,130
Think of them both
as tragic victims of war.

811
00:40:21,077 --> 00:40:23,845
If you can allow your anger
to subside for a moment

812
00:40:23,883 --> 00:40:26,583
you'll see
that they did not die in vain!

813
00:40:26,623 --> 00:40:28,787
The Romulans will enter the war!

814
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,528
There's no guarantee of that!

815
00:40:30,568 --> 00:40:32,402
Oh, but I think that there is.

816
00:40:32,439 --> 00:40:34,877
You see, when the Tal Shiar
finishes examining

817
00:40:34,912 --> 00:40:36,472
the wreckage
of Vreenak's shuttle

818
00:40:36,516 --> 00:40:38,214
they'll find
the burnt remnants

819
00:40:38,254 --> 00:40:40,225
of a Cardassian
optolythic data rod

820
00:40:40,259 --> 00:40:43,233
which somehow miraculously
survived the explosion.

821
00:40:43,267 --> 00:40:45,865
After painstaking
forensic examination

822
00:40:45,907 --> 00:40:48,779
they'll discover that the rod
contains a recording

823
00:40:48,815 --> 00:40:50,786
of a high-level Dominion meeting

824
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,953
at which the invasion of Romulus
was being planned.

825
00:40:53,995 --> 00:40:56,627
And then they'll discover
that it is a fraud!

826
00:40:56,668 --> 00:40:58,434
Oh, I don't think they will

827
00:40:58,473 --> 00:41:01,071
because any imperfections
in the forgery

828
00:41:01,113 --> 00:41:04,417
will appear to be a result
of the explosion.

829
00:41:04,456 --> 00:41:08,262
So, with a seemingly legitimate
rod in one hand

830
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,330
and a dead Senator
in the other...

831
00:41:11,373 --> 00:41:13,310
I ask you, Captain

832
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,339
what conclusion would you draw?

833
00:41:16,888 --> 00:41:21,423
That Vreenak obtained the rod
on Soukara

834
00:41:21,466 --> 00:41:24,268
and that the Dominion killed him

835
00:41:24,307 --> 00:41:27,109
to prevent him from returning
to Romulus with it.

836
00:41:27,147 --> 00:41:28,673
Precisely.

837
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:31,317
And the more the Dominion
protests its innocence

838
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,923
the more the Romulans
will believe they're guilty

839
00:41:33,965 --> 00:41:35,959
because it's exactly
what the Romulans

840
00:41:36,004 --> 00:41:38,134
would have done in their place.

841
00:41:40,148 --> 00:41:42,677
That's why you came to me...

842
00:41:42,721 --> 00:41:44,692
isn't it, Captain?

843
00:41:44,726 --> 00:41:46,856
Because you knew

844
00:41:46,899 --> 00:41:48,802
I could do those things

845
00:41:48,837 --> 00:41:51,435
that you weren't capable
of doing.

846
00:41:51,477 --> 00:41:53,972
Well, it worked,
and you'll get what you want...

847
00:41:54,017 --> 00:41:56,319
a war between the Romulans
and the Dominion

848
00:41:56,357 --> 00:41:58,453
and if your conscience
is bothering you

849
00:41:58,495 --> 00:42:01,024
you should soothe it
with the knowledge

850
00:42:01,069 --> 00:42:02,903
that you may have just saved

851
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:06,312
the entire Alpha Quadrant,
and all it cost

852
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,982
was the life
of one Romulan Senator

853
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:11,359
one criminal...

854
00:42:11,396 --> 00:42:17,572
and the self-respect
of one Starfleet Officer.

855
00:42:17,612 --> 00:42:20,312
I don't know about you

856
00:42:20,352 --> 00:42:24,192
but I'd call that a bargain.

857
00:42:24,229 --> 00:42:29,004
At 0800 hours, station time...

858
00:42:29,042 --> 00:42:31,880
the Romulan Empire
formally declared war

859
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:33,944
against the Dominion.

860
00:42:33,988 --> 00:42:36,552
They have already struck
15 bases

861
00:42:36,594 --> 00:42:39,864
along the Cardassian border.

862
00:42:39,903 --> 00:42:41,270
So...

863
00:42:41,374 --> 00:42:44,815
this is a huge victory
for the good guys.

864
00:42:44,849 --> 00:42:49,794
This may even be the turning
point of the entire war.

865
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:52,701
There is even
a "welcome to the fight" party

866
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,297
tonight in the Wardroom.

867
00:42:54,373 --> 00:42:56,105
So...

868
00:42:58,585 --> 00:43:01,114
I lied.

869
00:43:01,158 --> 00:43:02,559
I cheated.

870
00:43:04,768 --> 00:43:09,645
I bribed men to cover the crimes
of other men.

871
00:43:12,822 --> 00:43:15,762
I am an accessory to murder.

872
00:43:17,534 --> 00:43:20,166
But the most damning thing
of all...

873
00:43:21,945 --> 00:43:24,179
I think I can live with it.

874
00:43:26,123 --> 00:43:28,595
And if I had to do it
all over again...

875
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:31,399
I would.

876
00:43:33,242 --> 00:43:36,444
Garak was right about one thing.

877
00:43:36,483 --> 00:43:40,016
A guilty conscience
is a small price

878
00:43:40,059 --> 00:43:44,126
to pay for the safety
of the Alpha Quadrant

879
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:47,042
so I will learn...

880
00:43:47,078 --> 00:43:48,810
to live with it.

881
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:58,303
Because I can live with it.

882
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,449
I can live with it.

883
00:44:13,313 --> 00:44:14,407
Computer...

884
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,945
erase that entire personal log.
