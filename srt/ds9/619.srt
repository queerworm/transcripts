1
00:00:01,752 --> 00:00:06,799
Captain's Personal Log,
Stardate 517...

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,217
3, uh...

3
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:11,637
517...

4
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:12,721
4?

5
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,181
Computer, what day is it?

6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:17,559
(<i> computer beeps</i> )
Stardate 51721.3.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,521
It's only been two weeks.

8
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,903
I need to talk about this.

9
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:32,950
I have to justify what's
happened, what I've done...

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,619
at least to myself.

11
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,622
I can't talk to anyone else...

12
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,749
not even to Dax.

13
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,126
Maybe if I

14
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:49,341
just lay it all out in my log,
it'll finally make sense.

15
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:52,051
I can see
where it all went wrong...

16
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,013
where<i> I</i> went wrong.

17
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:59,267
I suppose
it started two weeks ago

18
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:03,522
<i>while I was posting the weekly</i>
<i>casualty list in the Wardroom.</i>

19
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,816
<i>Every Friday morning</i>
<i>for the past three months</i>

20
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,776
<i>I've posted the official list</i>

21
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:11,864
<i>of Starfleet personnel killed,</i>
<i>wounded or missing in the war.</i>

22
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:14,867
<i>It's become something</i>
<i>of a grim ritual around here.</i>

23
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:17,160
<i>Not a week goes by</i>

24
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,663
<i>that someone doesn't find</i>
<i>the name of a loved one</i>

25
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:24,001
<i>a friend or an acquaintance</i>
<i>on that damned list.</i>

26
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,837
<i>I've grown to hate Fridays.</i>

27
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:32,676
Who is it, Dax?

28
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,929
Leslie Wong.

29
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:37,222
The Skipper of the<i> Cairo?</i>

30
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,474
She was an instructor
at the Academy

31
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,809
when I was a sophomore.

32
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,895
Do you know what happened
to the<i> Cairo?</i>

33
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:45,773
No, just that she
disappeared on patrol

34
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,024
in the Romulan Neutral Zone.

35
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,149
I'll look into it.

36
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,777
DAX:
Don't bother-- I'm sure

37
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,152
it's the same old story.

38
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,154
The Jem'Hadar crossed
the Romulan border

39
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,907
and caught them by surprise.

40
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:57,659
It's only about the hundredth
time it's happened.

41
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,327
I can't believe
the Romulans allow them

42
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,288
to violate their territory
so brazenly.

43
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,748
Why do they get away with it?

44
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,249
The Romulans
have a treaty

45
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,752
of nonaggression and friendship
with the Dominion.

46
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:10,047
So they're willing to turn
a blind eye to almost anything

47
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,381
in the name of friendship.

48
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,174
What we need to do is
bring the Romulans

49
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,426
into the war on our side.

50
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,011
With the combined forces

51
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,721
of the Federation,
the Klingons<i> and</i> the Romulans

52
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,306
we could finally
go on the offensive.

53
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,642
That's the last thing
the Romulans want.

54
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,768
Think about it.

55
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,645
They're in
the perfect position.

56
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,105
They get to sit back and watch

57
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:28,398
as their biggest rivals
slug it out

58
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,942
in a long, bloody war.

59
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:32,069
No one's threatening
their interests.

60
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,779
Why should
they risk their necks?

61
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,363
There's simply
no reason for them

62
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,698
to get involved in<i> our</i> war...

63
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,284
no reason at all.

64
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,620
SISKO:
<i>That was the moment</i>
<i>I made the decision.</i>

65
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,789
<i>It was like I had stepped</i>
<i>through a door</i>

66
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,499
<i>and locked it behind me.</i>

67
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,209
<i>I was going to bring</i>
<i>the Romulans into the war.</i>

68
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,123
It's in their own best
interests to join the war.

69
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:50,791
That's the key.

70
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,043
That's the reason the Romulans
will finally take action

71
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,502
not to do<i> us</i> any favors

72
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,588
but to protect themselves
from the Dominion.

73
00:04:56,588 --> 00:05:00,175
Okay, let's say
I'm the Romulan Proconsul.

74
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,551
From where I'm sitting

75
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,386
the Dominion isn't
a threat to me.

76
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,472
I have a nonaggression pact
with them.

77
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,015
They are my allies.

78
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,475
You're not going
to put your faith

79
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,768
in some piece of paper, are you?

80
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,645
Not at all.

81
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,105
I've been watching them
very closely

82
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,731
since the beginning of the war

83
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,692
and so far, they've kept
their part of the bargain.

84
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,987
They're violating your territory
almost every day.

85
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,863
What kind of an ally is that?

86
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,032
So they're crossing
my backyard

87
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,993
to give the Federation
a bloody nose.

88
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,995
I can't say that makes me
feel very sad.

89
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,955
You can't be naive enough
to think

90
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,457
that the Dominion is going
to stop with the Federation.

91
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,002
When they're finished with us,
they're coming after you.

92
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,045
That's speculation.

93
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,755
The Founders see it
as their sacred duty

94
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,423
to bring order
to the galaxy--<i> their</i> order.

95
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,925
Do you think they'll sit idly by

96
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,844
while you keep
your chaotic empire

97
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,345
right next to their
perfect order? No.

98
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,890
If you watch us go under,
then what you're really doing

99
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,391
is signing
your own death warrant.

100
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:53,145
But before I plunge my people
into a conflict

101
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:56,857
that will kill millions
of loyal Romulan citizens

102
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,276
I need something more concrete

103
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,569
than the
self-serving argument

104
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,197
of a Starfleet
officer.

105
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,782
I need proof
of Dominion duplicity.

106
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,202
Not more words...

107
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,661
proof.

108
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,169
Very good, old man.

109
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,837
You would have made
a decent Romulan.

110
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:23,382
I prefer the spots
to the pointed ears.

111
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:24,926
(<i> sighs</i> )

112
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,386
Okay, you've convinced me.

113
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,056
They're going to need evidence.

114
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,185
But if there<i> is</i> evidence

115
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:36,188
of a Dominion plan
to attack Romulus

116
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,899
it's probably buried
deep in the bowels

117
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,526
of their headquarters
on Cardassia Prime.

118
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,029
Not exactly the most accessible
place in the galaxy.

119
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,115
Hmm...

120
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:53,080
Not for us, maybe, but there<i> is</i>
someone on this station

121
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,374
who specializes
in gaining access

122
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,709
to places
where he is not welcome.

123
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,379
I must say I'm
flattered, Captain.

124
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,672
I had no idea
you held such

125
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,507
a lofty opinion of me.

126
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,593
Your faith
in my ability

127
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,678
to retrieve
classified information

128
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,637
from my former homeland

129
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,265
is most gratifying.

130
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:14,017
Mr. Garak, let's dispense
with the usual repartee

131
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,395
and concentrate
on the issue at hand.

132
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:17,896
Can you do it or not?

133
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:23,735
No one wants to see the Dominion
destroyed more than I do

134
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,904
but to go to Cardassia Prime

135
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,115
penetrate one of the most
heavily guarded facilities

136
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:31,368
in the Quadrant,
steal top secret war plans

137
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,369
and then return them

138
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,578
safely to you

139
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,580
is not just
another job.

140
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,832
It's more like
a suicide mission

141
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,752
and<i> that</i> is well outside

142
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,046
my field
of expertise.

143
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,093
I didn't say you had
to go there yourself.

144
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:51,138
I have to believe
that a man like you

145
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:54,224
still has a few
contacts at home--

146
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,644
a colleague from
the Obsidian Order...

147
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,105
an old friend...

148
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:03,066
a reliable informant...

149
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,693
someone who<i> might</i> 
owe you a favor.

150
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,570
Perhaps.

151
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,199
Then I'd say it's time
to call in a favor.

152
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,911
It would mean calling in
<i>all</i> my favors, Captain.

153
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,331
To do what you're asking
would use up

154
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:22,543
every resource I have left
on Cardassia.

155
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,671
And it may be....

156
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,924
a very messy,
very bloody business.

157
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,718
Are you prepared for that?

158
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,933
I posted my 14th casualty
list this morning.

159
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,685
I'm already involved

160
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:43,564
in a very messy,
very bloody business.

161
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,109
And the only way
I can see to end it

162
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,653
is to bring the Romulans
into the war.

163
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,239
I am prepared to do
whatever it takes

164
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,701
to accomplish that goal,
but I can't do it alone.

165
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,744
I need help.

166
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,621
Now...

167
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,291
are you in or out?

168
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,421
I'm in.

169
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,673
SISKO:
<i>My father used to say</i>
<i>that the road to hell</i>

170
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,009
<i>is paved with good intentions.</i>

171
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:15,222
I laid the first stone
right there.

172
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,517
I'd committed myself.

173
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:21,853
I'd pay any price,
go to any lengths

174
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,980
because my cause was righteous.

175
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,194
My... intentions were good.

176
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:34,157
In the beginning,
that seemed like enough.

177
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,956
SISKO:
<i>If there's one thing</i>
<i>I've learned over the years</i>

178
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,125
<i>it's that bad news</i>
<i>invariably comes</i>

179
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,420
<i>in the middle of the night.</i>

180
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,255
Kira to Captain Sisko.

181
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:51,925
Go ahead, Major.

182
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,261
KIRA: We just received
a priority one communication

183
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,137
from Starfleet Command.

184
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,265
The Dominion
has invaded Betazed.

185
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:04,104
According to initial reports,
the invasion force

186
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,731
must have come from somewhere
in the Calandra Sector.

187
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,066
Did Starfleet
Intelligence

188
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,526
know anything
about the buildup?

189
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:10,444
No. They
believed

190
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:11,945
Calandra
was too far

191
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,572
from the Dominion supply lines
to be a threat.

192
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,865
SISKO:
There's plenty of blame
to go around.

193
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,243
The Tenth Fleet was supposed
to be protecting Betazed

194
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,786
and its outlying colonies,

195
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,456
but it was caught out of
position on a training exercise.

196
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:25,041
What's worse, Betazed's
own defense systems

197
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,334
are obsolete
and undermanned.

198
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,669
The planet
was theirs

199
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,921
in less than ten hours.

200
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,506
KIRA:
With Betazed
in the hands

201
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,841
of the Jem'Hadar,
the Dominion is in a position

202
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:37,845
to threaten Vulcan,
Andor, Tellar, Alpha Centauri.

203
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:41,391
If we ever needed a new ally,
it's right now.

204
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,730
(<i> door opens</i> )

205
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,066
Mr. Garak.

206
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,443
It's been three days.

207
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:52,902
Have you made any progress?

208
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,446
Well, I suppose
that depends

209
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:55,405
on how you look at it.

210
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,739
This is how I look at it:

211
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,908
Betazed has just fallen
to the Dominion

212
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,619
and we need to get
this operation underway.

213
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:03,079
I share your desire
for swift action, Captain.

214
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,415
In fact,
after our last conversation

215
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,543
I made a few discreet inquiries
among my former associates

216
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,003
still living on Cardassia.

217
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,671
As I anticipated,

218
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,508
they shared my loathing
for the current government

219
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:18,553
and were willing to take on
any assignment aimed
at its destruction.

220
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,305
That sounds like
progress to me.

221
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:24,392
Doesn't it? Unfortunately,
they're all dead now.

222
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,393
What?

223
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,853
Yes.

224
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,564
All killed within one day
of speaking with me.

225
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,650
I suppose that's a testament

226
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,068
to the effectiveness
of Dominion Security.

227
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:37,322
One should admire
such efficiency.

228
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,281
Oh.

229
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,825
I'm sorry.

230
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,910
I hope you're not
giving up that easily.

231
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,414
After all, the stakes
are much higher

232
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,999
than a few dead operatives.

233
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:51,211
The fate of the entire Quadrant
hangs in the balance...

234
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,922
or at least that's the case
you made to me.

235
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,424
Do you have another plan?

236
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,969
As a matter of fact, I do

237
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:03,097
but I suspect
you won't like it.

238
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,599
Try me.

239
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,893
If you want to guarantee
that we obtain evidence

240
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,354
of a Dominion plot
to attack the Romulans

241
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:15,151
I suggest that we manufacture
that evidence ourselves.

242
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,404
Maybe I should have put a stop
to it right there.

243
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,821
Maybe I should have said

244
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,781
"Thank you very much
for your input, Mr. Garak.

245
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,201
I will take your suggestion
under advisement,"

246
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:26,037
and gone back to my office
and forgotten the whole thing

247
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,955
but I didn't...

248
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:33,336
because in my heart, I knew
what he was saying made sense.

249
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,795
His name is Vreenak.

250
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,174
He's been a key member

251
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,260
of the Romulan Senate
for the past 14 years.

252
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,679
He's Secretary of
the War Plans Council

253
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,389
Vice Chairman
of the Tal Shiar

254
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:48,101
and one of the most trusted
advisors to Proconsul Neral.

255
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,977
He's also the man
that negotiated

256
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,272
the nonaggression pact
with the Dominion.

257
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,648
Since you're familiar with him

258
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,483
I'll skip the rest
of his biography.

259
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,695
What's important is that he
continues to be one of the most

260
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,615
ardently pro-Dominion voices
in the Senate.

261
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:04,492
If we can convince<i> him</i>
that the Dominion is a threat

262
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,453
the rest of the Senate
will follow.

263
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,538
All right. How?

264
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,956
Ten days from now

265
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,459
Senator Vreenak will be
making a trip to Soukara

266
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,628
for a diplomatic
meeting with Weyoun.

267
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:17,046
I am certain that
he can be persuaded

268
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,549
to make a secret
detour to DS9

269
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:23,470
<i>if</i> he were invited by
one Captain Benjamin Sisko.

270
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,722
How do you know he'll
be visiting Soukara?

271
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,308
There are some things
I'd rather not discuss.

272
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,309
May I continue?

273
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,769
Please.

274
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,146
When Senator Vreenak arrives,
you will show him

275
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,982
a holographic recording
of a secret meeting

276
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,858
held at the highest
level of the Dominion

277
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,612
in which the planned
invasion of Romulus

278
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:41,988
is being discussed.

279
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,281
You will tell
the Senator

280
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:45,116
that this information
was obtained

281
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,785
through various
covert means

282
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,827
at great cost
to the Federation.

283
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:51,331
At least ten good
men lost their lives

284
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,874
bringing it across the
line-- that sort of thing.

285
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,127
He will immediately
suspect it's a forgery

286
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,337
but you will assure him

287
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,213
that such a thing
would be impossible.

288
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,548
"You see, Senator

289
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,134
"this is an official Cardassian
transcript.

290
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:06,680
"It was recorded on a one-time
optolythic data rod

291
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,515
"used for official
record keeping.

292
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,058
"These rods are manufactured
only as needed

293
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,686
"on Cardassia Prime.

294
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:15,355
"Information can only be
transcribed on them once

295
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,565
and then cannot be altered."

296
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,275
He'll want to examine it.

297
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,443
Of course.

298
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,612
And he will discover,
to his amazement

299
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:26,449
that it is completely genuine,
at least, so it will appear.

300
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,201
But in reality?

301
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,287
You will have handed him
a genuine optolythic data rod

302
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,374
but it will contain one
of the most perfect forgeries

303
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,000
ever fashioned.

304
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,545
I'm still working
on obtaining the data rod

305
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:42,256
but I have found the man who
will create the holo-recording.

306
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,176
You realize I can't authorize
a thing like this on my own.

307
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,886
I have to clear it
with Starfleet Command.

308
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,139
Of course, but I suspect
that with the fall of Betazed

309
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,058
they'll be ready to do
whatever it takes

310
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,352
to bring the Romulans
into the war.

311
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,816
I'll let you know.

312
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,776
Uh, one last thing, Captain.

313
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:05,739
The man we need to forge
this holo-program

314
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,448
is currently sitting
in a Klingon prison

315
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,825
awaiting execution.

316
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,536
To save time
and, incidentally, his life

317
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,996
I thought that perhaps
you could contact

318
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,417
Chancellor Gowron today
and arrange a pardon?

319
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,835
What's his name?

320
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,087
Grathon Tolar.

321
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:25,800
I cannot tell you how
<i>grateful</i> I am, Captain.

322
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,136
The Klingons were going
to execute me tomorrow.

323
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,389
Of course, they say
that every day.

324
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,600
It's one of the little
games they like to play.

325
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,934
(<i> laughs</i> )

326
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,977
You do understand the terms
of your parole.

327
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,605
Oh, yes.

328
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,775
I have to promise to stay
away from the Klingon Empire.

329
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:42,734
(<i> dry chuckle</i> )

330
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,026
That'll be tough.

331
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,111
(<i> laughs</i> )

332
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,487
And I have to create

333
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:51,367
some kind of a special
holo-program for you.

334
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,368
(<i> chuckles</i> )

335
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,703
Well, I can hardly wait.

336
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,038
I've never worked
for Starfleet before.

337
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,082
Let's be very clear about this.

338
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,000
You're not working
for Starfleet.

339
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,545
This entire matter
is off the record.

340
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:05,548
As far as you're concerned,
you're working for me.

341
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,508
Oh, a personal matter.

342
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,802
(<i> laughs</i> )

343
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:11,930
Something special,
for your eyes only?

344
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,265
Something with,
perhaps

345
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:18,144
five or six Orion
slave girls and... oh...

346
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,228
Mr. Tolar.

347
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,939
I suggest you go

348
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,941
and wait in your quarters.

349
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:24,400
Mr. Garak will
provide you with all

350
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,902
the information
you need.

351
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,529
Garak... is here?

352
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,239
That's right.

353
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,951
Oh... oh...

354
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:37,037
Well... that's different.

355
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,001
I'll wait in my quarters.

356
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,338
SISKO:
<i>Why I didn't listen</i>

357
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,214
<i>to the voice</i>
<i>in the back of my mind</i>

358
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,258
<i>telling me not to believe</i>
<i>a word he said</i>

359
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,093
<i>I'll never know.</i>

360
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,429
<i>But it didn't take long</i>
<i>for me to come face-to-face</i>

361
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,182
<i>with the fact</i>
<i>that I'd made a mistake.</i>

362
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,100
Odo to the Captain.

363
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,477
Go ahead, Constable.

364
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:00,854
I'm sorry to disturb you

365
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,523
but do you know a man
named Grathon Tolar?

366
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,065
Yes. Why do you ask?

367
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,610
Because he just tried
to kill Quark.

368
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,620
BASHIR:
Sit still, Quark.
You'll be fine.

369
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,123
All right,
keep an eye on him.

370
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,210
What happened?

371
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,588
As I understand it, Mr. Tolar
over there came in

372
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,840
about two hours ago

373
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,717
ordered a bottle
of Whelan bitters.

374
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,427
15 minutes later,
he ordered a second bottle

375
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,095
and then a third.

376
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,681
Halfway through
his fourth bottle

377
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,851
he decided to dance
with M'Pella.

378
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:42,269
She was otherwise
engaged, running

379
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,230
the dabo wheel,
declined his invitation.

380
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,357
He decided
to force the issue.

381
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:50,695
A brief struggle ensued,
and Quark

382
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:53,280
in an uncharacteristic
display of chivalry

383
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,159
attempted to intervene,
so Tolar stabbed him.

384
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,619
Normally, he'd be

385
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,914
sitting in a holding
cell, but he claims

386
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,498
he's a friend of yours.

387
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,250
He's no friend of mine...

388
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,960
but he is working for me.

389
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,379
It's an extremely
sensitive matter

390
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,464
concerning Federation security.

391
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:13,133
I can't have any record
of him being on the station.

392
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,428
I see.

393
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,849
I am certainly aware
of the need

394
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,602
for special security measures
during wartime

395
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,604
but, as a matter of law

396
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:28,315
if Quark chooses
to press charges against Tolar

397
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,902
I have no choice
but to make an arrest.

398
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:32,486
May I speak to Quark?

399
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,992
How is he?

400
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,620
How do I look? I'm a man who
just had a brush with death.

401
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,746
He'll be fine.

402
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,122
His ribs deflected
the knife

403
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,164
from his major organs.

404
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,625
Bleeding was superficial.

405
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,751
Superficial?

406
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,336
Do you know how much
this shirt cost?

407
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,547
Will you excuse us
for a moment, Doctor?

408
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,590
I'll check on
you tomorrow.

409
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,265
Do you intend to press charges?

410
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,267
You bet I do.

411
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,853
What will it take, um...

412
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,441
to, uh, convince you otherwise?

413
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,693
Are you offering me...

414
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,778
(<i> whispers</i> ):
a bribe?

415
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,450
I knew it.

416
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,536
Captain, I've always liked you.

417
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,622
I suspected that somewhere deep
down in your heart of hearts

418
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,833
there was a tiny bit of Ferengi
just waiting to get out.

419
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,417
What's your price?

420
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:32,212
Well... let's start with
replacing my clothes

421
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,589
and M'Pella's clothes.

422
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,674
All right.

423
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,717
I'm not finished.

424
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,470
I think I should be compensated

425
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,472
for the loss of business
I suffered today

426
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:45,559
which I calculate
as no<i> less</i> than...

427
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,688
five bars
of gold-pressed latinum.

428
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,066
Done.

429
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:55,778
I'm also having a problem
with Station Security.

430
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:59,032
They're holding
some cargo containers

431
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,616
which I've been waiting for

432
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:04,620
because of some missing
import license or something.

433
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,997
I'll handle it.

434
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,623
A-anything else?

435
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,791
No.

436
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:13,004
I think we can call it a bribe.

437
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,797
And thank you, Captain.

438
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,966
Thank you for
restoring my faith

439
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:19,385
in the 98th Rule
of Acquisition.

440
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,471
"Every man has his price."

441
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:31,355
That was my first moment
of real doubt...

442
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,858
when I started to wonder...

443
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:37,153
if this whole thing
was a mistake.

444
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,783
So then I went back
to my office...

445
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,871
and there...

446
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:50,833
was a new casualty list
waiting for me.

447
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:58,591
People are dying
out there every day!

448
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:02,636
Entire worlds are struggling
for their freedom

449
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,389
and here<i> I</i> am, still worrying

450
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,392
about the finer points
of morality.

451
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:13,022
No, I... I had to keep my eye
on the ball.

452
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:15,315
Winning the war,
stopping the bloodshed--

453
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,193
<i>those</i> were the priorities!

454
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,153
<i>So I pushed on</i>

455
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:21,155
<i>and every time another doubt</i>
<i>appeared before me</i>

456
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:24,158
<i>I just found another way</i>
<i>to shove it aside.</i>

457
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:26,077
Mind if I join you?

458
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:28,495
Be my guest.

459
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,709
Ops.

460
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,253
Hold. The less I'm seen

461
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,255
parading through Ops,
the better.

462
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:39,048
I couldn't agree more.

463
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:40,466
You seem angry.

464
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,260
Who's watching Tolar?

465
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,844
I've locked him
in his quarters.

466
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,805
I've also left him
with the distinct impression

467
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,765
that if he attempts
to force the door open

468
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,100
it may explode.

469
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,310
I hope that's
just an impression.

470
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,939
It's best not to dwell
on such minutiae.

471
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:58,651
In any case, we have far more
important matters to discuss.

472
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,778
I've located a gentleman
willing to sell us

473
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:03,072
a genuine
optolythic data rod.

474
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,991
How do you know
it's genuine?

475
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,118
I trust the source,
but rest assured

476
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:09,829
I will confirm
the rod's authenticity

477
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:13,207
before I make payment,
which brings me to you.

478
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:14,917
How much does he want?

479
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:18,504
I'm afraid he's not
interested in latinum.

480
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:19,880
The gentleman in question

481
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,716
has requested
to be compensated with...

482
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:27,013
200 liters of biomimetic gel.

483
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,014
What?!

484
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,723
I don't know
why, exactly.

485
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,684
One would assume
it has something to do

486
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,560
with genetic experimentation.

487
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,146
Offer him something else.

488
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:37,439
Believe me, I wouldn't
be relaying this request

489
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,942
if I thought
he'd take something else.

490
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:43,070
Biomimetic gel is strictly
controlled by the Federation

491
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,031
and not for sale at any price.

492
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,992
Find someone else
who's willing to sell us a rod.

493
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,327
I wasn't exaggerating

494
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:51,369
when I told you
about the near impossibility

495
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:54,999
of obtaining a genuine
Cardassian data rod.

496
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,625
It's something
of a minor miracle

497
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,003
that I was able
to locate this one source.

498
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:02,506
I'm virtually certain
I won't find another.

499
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:06,302
I'm afraid we either
give him what he wants

500
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:09,972
or forget
the whole enterprise.

501
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,309
Then let's forget
about it.

502
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:14,352
Ops.

503
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,313
Hold.

504
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,815
200 liters is out
of the question.

505
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:23,569
There's not that much gel
in the entire sector.

506
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:28,074
I believe that the quantity
is open to negotiation.

507
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:35,581
Ops.

508
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,208
Captain, biomimetic gel

509
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,126
is an<i> extremely</i> dangerous
compound, as you know.

510
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,045
I can't release it
without at least some idea

511
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:42,255
of where it's going.

512
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:43,630
In the wrong hands,
it could be used

513
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,008
to make biogenic weapons,
or for illegal

514
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,927
replication experiments or to
develop organic explosives--

515
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,845
Perhaps I didn't
make myself clear, Doctor.

516
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,972
This is not a request;
it's an order.

517
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,099
You will package

518
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,516
85 liters of
biomimetic gel

519
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,102
for interstellar
transport

520
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:58,187
and deliver them
to Cargo Bay 3.

521
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,355
Is that understood?

522
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,024
Yes.

523
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,610
I'd like this order
in writing, please, sir.

524
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:09,907
I thought you might.

525
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:13,493
You should know

526
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,703
that I shall note
this in my log

527
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,163
and file an
official protest

528
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,623
with Starfleet Medical.

529
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,708
That is your right,
but I want the gel

530
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:20,751
by the end of the day.

531
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:21,794
Dismissed.

532
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:30,510
The Founders
have decided

533
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,554
to implement stage two
ahead of schedule.

534
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,348
The invasion
of Romulus?

535
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,392
It's too soon.

536
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:38,436
We're engaged
in heavy fighting

537
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:40,104
all along the border
with the Federation.

538
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,147
The Klingons
are preparing

539
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,189
to go on the offensive, and--

540
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,399
Fortunately,
the Founders

541
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,234
have better
vision than you do.

542
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,569
They can see the
opportunities before us

543
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,946
even when you cannot.

544
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:51,365
Consider...

545
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:55,702
the Romulans don't expect
an attack from Cardassia.

546
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,831
The bulk of the Romulan fleet
is still deployed

547
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:01,375
along the Neutral Zone
with the Federation.

548
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:04,003
The Founders estimate
we could be on Romulus itself

549
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,712
in less
than three weeks.

550
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,298
Three weeks?

551
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:09,300
I heard the same
kind of estimates

552
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,177
before we attacked
the Federation.

553
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:12,594
Those plans were ruined

554
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,972
by the incompetency
of your predecessor.

555
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:17,183
Gul Dukat
is a great man.

556
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:18,934
Gul Dukat is a
preening egotist

557
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,227
and a fool.

558
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,603
We offered him
unchallenged control

559
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,356
of the Alpha
Quadrant, and all

560
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:25,274
he could think about
was his daughter.

561
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,321
(<i> chuckles</i> )

562
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,365
Now, shall
we get back

563
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:33,407
to the business
at hand?

564
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,742
That's it.
Freeze program.

565
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:39,830
That's all
the new material.

566
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,708
The rest of the program plays
exactly as you saw before.

567
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:43,959
What do you think?

568
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,253
It's, uh, better.

569
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,421
They seem more real.

570
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:49,715
Yes, and all
I had to do was add

571
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:52,218
a little petty bickering
and mutual loathing.

572
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:54,678
So, you are happy.

573
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,807
It's... satisfactory.

574
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,767
You may record the program

575
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,102
onto the
data rod now.

576
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,318
(<i> quietly</i> ):
I received a message.

577
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:11,278
Senator Vreenak
is on the way.

578
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,321
Excellent.

579
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,451
Done.

580
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:19,286
(<i> chuckles</i> )

581
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,954
Who gets it?

582
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:25,376
Just... put it in the case.

583
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:26,460
Ah.

584
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,546
(<i> chuckling</i> )

585
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:36,011
Well... it has been
a<i> pleasure</i>

586
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,305
doing business
with you gentlemen.

587
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,890
Call me again
if you ever--

588
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,392
You're not going
anywhere.

589
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:43,852
What...?
What do you mean?

590
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,312
I mean, you're not leaving

591
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:48,232
until your work is accepted
by our client.

592
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:49,649
Well, that isn't fair.

593
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,860
You can't keep me here
against my will.

594
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,611
I haven't done anything wrong.

595
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:56,115
<i>We</i> had an agreement!

596
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,657
I'm making a new agreement.

597
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:00,827
If that program passes
inspection, you walk free

598
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:03,581
but if there is even
the slightest flaw

599
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:06,542
then I will send you back
to that Klingon prison

600
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:09,962
and tell Gowron to take his
time while he executes you.

601
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:12,590
All right. It will pass.

602
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,507
You'll see.

603
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,137
It... will... pass.

604
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,264
I sincerely hope so.

605
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:23,016
Now, why don't you go back
to your quarters?

606
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:26,728
I'll be along shortly
to say... hello.

607
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:36,113
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

608
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:37,490
(<i> pounds fist</i> )

609
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:41,076
Maybe I was under more pressure
than I realized.

610
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,454
Maybe it was<i> really</i> 
starting to get to me.

611
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:48,501
But I was off the hook.

612
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:52,630
Starfleet Command had given
the plan their blessing

613
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,508
and I thought
<i>that</i> would make things easier.

614
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:03,932
But I was the one
who had to make it happen.

615
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:10,523
I was the one who had to look
Senator Vreenak in his eye...

616
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:13,859
and convince him that a lie...

617
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,195
was the truth.

618
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,989
So while you're entertaining
the Senator in the Wardroom

619
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:20,407
I'll take the opportunity

620
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,326
to make a quick search
of his ship's database.

621
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,494
For what?

622
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:24,953
Well, for any intelligence
information

623
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,247
he may have picked up
on the Dominion in Soukara.

624
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,624
What if you get caught?

625
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:29,958
Oh, I think
that's highly unlikely.

626
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,960
I doubt the Senator
will be traveling

627
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,338
with more than
four bodyguards at the most.

628
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:36,423
Two will stand watch
outside the Wardroom

629
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,758
and two will stay
in the landing bay.

630
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:41,970
I assure you, they'll never know
I was even<i> near</i> their ship.

631
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,431
Just make sure
you don't get caught.

632
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,232
Report.

633
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:54,900
Sections 52 Baker
through 62 Baker

634
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,942
have been secured.

635
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:56,985
I have posted
armed guards

636
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,571
at every
entry point

637
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:00,822
and I have personally scanned
all compartments

638
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,408
for signs
of surveillance equipment.

639
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:04,076
Very good, Commander.

640
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:07,538
Maintain current security
measures until further notice.

641
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:09,289
<i>No one</i> is
to enter this area

642
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,541
except Mr. Garak
and myself.

643
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:11,875
Aye, sir.

644
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,752
Always a pleasure
to see you, Mr. Worf.

645
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,674
KIRA:
Ops to Captain Sisko.

646
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,133
Go ahead, Major.

647
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,801
We've just received
the coded subspace signal

648
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:22,844
you were waiting for.

649
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:23,845
Should I reply?

650
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,556
No reply, Major.

651
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:26,640
Sisko out.

652
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:35,107
(<i> warning Klaxon sounds</i> )

653
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,976
I'll take my leave
of you now, Captain.

654
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,936
Oh, and one last thing.

655
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,397
Vreenak believes
he's on the winning side

656
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:17,608
so until you can prove otherwise

657
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:20,902
you may have to put up
with a certain...

658
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:21,903
acerbic attitude.

659
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,238
Uh, Mr. Garak,

660
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,616
after having spent
a week with you

661
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:29,035
I have developed a
very, very thick skin.

662
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,037
Good luck.

663
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,218
Welcome aboard,
Senator.

664
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:48,013
I'm Captain
Benjamin Sisko.

665
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:52,810
So, you're the Commander
of Deep Space Nine...

666
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,978
and the Emissary
to the Prophets

667
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:59,358
decorated combat officer,
widower, father, mentor.

668
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,193
And, oh, yes--

669
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,487
the man who started the war
with the Dominion.

670
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,366
Somehow I thought
you'd be taller.

671
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:08,784
Sorry to disappoint you.

672
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,118
To be honest,

673
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:13,205
my opinion of
Starfleet officers is so low

674
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:16,041
you'd have to work very hard
indeed to disappoint<i> me.</i>

675
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,292
If you'll
come with me

676
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,918
I'll show you
to your quarters.

677
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,004
I look forward
to seeing your station--

678
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,631
while it's still here, that is.

679
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:25,509
The way the war's going
with the Federation

680
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:27,260
it may not be around
much longer.

681
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,606
Mmm.

682
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,859
A fair approximation, but...

683
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:44,695
somewhat lacking in aroma.

684
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:48,907
Real<i> kali-fal</i> should forcibly
open one's sinuses

685
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,034
well before the first sip.

686
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,870
We don't have
much experience

687
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,163
in replicating
Romulan beverages.

688
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,416
Of course, all of
that would change

689
00:31:57,416 --> 00:32:00,711
if we became allies
instead of cold warriors.

690
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,630
You are persistent, Captain.

691
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,006
I'll grant you that.

692
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,551
But dogged determination
isn't enough

693
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:10,136
to change the reality
of your situation.

694
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:14,933
Time is definitely
not on your side.

695
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,018
The Dominion shipyards
are operating

696
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,478
at 100 percent capacity.

697
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,479
Yours are still

698
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,314
being rebuilt.

699
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:27,028
The Dominion is breeding legions
of Jem'Hadar soldiers every day.

700
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:30,532
You're experiencing
a manpower shortage.

701
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:33,034
But most important...

702
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:41,376
the Dominion is resolved
to win the war at any cost.

703
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,170
You and I both know

704
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,924
the Federation has already
put out peace feelers.

705
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:49,092
Now, in all candor

706
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:52,721
if you were in my position,
which side would you choose?

707
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:55,599
I'd pick the side
most likely to leave us in peace

708
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,225
when the dust settles.

709
00:32:57,225 --> 00:33:00,061
Maybe you're right.

710
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:03,064
Maybe the Dominion<i> will</i> win
in the end.

711
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,901
Then the Founders will control
what we now call Cardassia

712
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:09,237
the Klingon Empire
and the Federation.

713
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,031
So, instead of facing
three separate opponents

714
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,033
with three
separate agendas

715
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,869
you'll find
yourselves facing

716
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:18,497
the same opponent on every side.

717
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,332
There's a word for that--

718
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,917
surrounded.

719
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:26,296
It<i> really</i> is a good replica.

720
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,590
The aroma's
starting to grow on me.

721
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,759
For a moment there, I almost
forgot it wasn't the real thing

722
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,845
but only for a moment.

723
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:36,181
You make some
very good points, Captain

724
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:40,018
but it's still
all speculation and theory--

725
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,355
nothing that would warrant
abrogating our treaty

726
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,398
and plunging the Empire
into war.

727
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,320
What if I told you

728
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,198
that the Dominion
is planning a sneak attack

729
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:56,284
on the Romulan Empire
at this very moment?

730
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:59,496
Mmm...

731
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,581
I'd want proof.

732
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:06,795
WEYOUN:
And with the Cardassian
Fourth Order

733
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,380
protecting their flank

734
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,757
the 23rd Jem'Hadar division
will begin its thrust

735
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,676
across the Glintara Sector.

736
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:14,720
They should begin
the invasion of Romulus

737
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,346
on the following day.

738
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:18,557
Once we've taken the homeworld

739
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,392
organized resistance
will crumble

740
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,227
when outlying
systems and colonies

741
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,479
begin looking out
for themselves.

742
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,981
Consolidation of
the entire empire

743
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,357
will take three
months at most.

744
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:28,734
DAMAR:
What if the
Romulan fleet

745
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,402
reacts faster than
you're anticipating?

746
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:31,778
What if they pull
all of their forces

747
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,238
away from the
Federation border

748
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,073
at the first sign
of our attack?

749
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,075
WEYOUN:
I place my faith
in the Founders.

750
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,243
They say

751
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,203
the Romulans
are not ready for war

752
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,788
and will not react fast enough

753
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,206
once it begins.

754
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:46,125
Now, do you wish to
dispute their judgment?

755
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,838
No, of course not.

756
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:54,300
I serve the Founders.

757
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,135
As do we all.

758
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,721
Meeting adjourned.

759
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:06,646
I'd like to examine...

760
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,941
that data rod.

761
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:30,211
So all I could do was wait...

762
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:35,425
and see how masterful
Tolar's forgery really was.

763
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,640
So I waited.

764
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,643
Tried to catch up
on my paperwork.

765
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:51,900
But I-I found it
very difficult to focus on...

766
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,402
criminal activity reports? Ha.

767
00:35:56,863 --> 00:36:00,158
Cargo manifests.

768
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,494
So I went back to pacing...

769
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,663
and staring out of the window.

770
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,670
I'm not an impatient man.

771
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:17,592
I'm not one to agonize over
decisions once they're made.

772
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,428
I got that from my father.

773
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,931
He always says...

774
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,724
"Worry and doubt

775
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:29,187
"are the greatest enemies
of a great chef.

776
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:34,359
"The soufflé will either rise
or it won't.

777
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:37,362
"There's not a damn thing
you can do about it

778
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:40,365
"so you might as well
just sit back and wait

779
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,159
and see what happens."

780
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,086
But this time...

781
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,924
the cost of failure
was so high...

782
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:03,180
I found it difficult
to take his advice.

783
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,808
<i>If Vreenak discovered that</i>
<i>the data rod was a forgery</i>

784
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,685
<i>if he realized</i>
<i>that we were trying</i>

785
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:11,354
<i>to trick them into the war,</i>
<i>it could push the Romulans</i>

786
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,732
<i>even farther</i>
<i>into the enemy camp.</i>

787
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:16,401
<i>They could start</i>
<i>to openly help the Dominion.</i>

788
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,070
<i>If worse came to worst</i>

789
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,363
<i>they could actually join</i>
<i>the war against us.</i>

790
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,865
<i>I had the distinct feeling</i>

791
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:23,783
<i>that victory or defeat</i>
<i>would be decided</i>

792
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,744
<i>in the next few minutes.</i>

793
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,881
It's a fake!

794
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:49,184
So, it all blew up in my face.

795
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:56,315
And all the lies
and compromises...

796
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,526
the inner doubts
and rationalizations--

797
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,862
all for nothing.

798
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:04,365
Vreenak was furious.

799
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,618
I can't say I blamed him.

800
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,954
I'd have reacted the same way.

801
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:13,959
After telling me
in no uncertain terms

802
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:16,711
that he would expose
this "vile deception"

803
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,671
to the entire Alpha Quadrant

804
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:21,758
he got back in his shuttle
and headed home.

805
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,097
There didn't seem
to be anything more to do.

806
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:29,432
<i>So, I went back to work.</i>

807
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:32,018
<i>Two days later, I got the news.</i>

808
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:37,190
No one for me today.

809
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,441
I had one.

810
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,235
Maria Tatalia,
wounded in action.

811
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,945
BASHIR:
Friend?

812
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:43,362
Friend of a friend.

813
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,781
Actually, I only met her once.

814
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:46,283
I don't think she'd remember me.

815
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:48,326
Friend of a friend
between the two of us.

816
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,162
Well, I know
it sounds a bit strange

817
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:52,747
but I'd say we're off
to a pretty good start today.

818
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,415
Captain, we just
received word

819
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,793
from Starfleet Intelligence
that a Romulan shuttlecraft

820
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:58,503
carrying a high-ranking Senator

821
00:38:58,503 --> 00:38:59,712
has just
been destroyed.

822
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:00,755
Which Senator?

823
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,423
Senator Vreenak.

824
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,925
He was returning to Romulus

825
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:06,136
from a diplomatic mission
to Soukara

826
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:07,304
when his shuttle exploded.

827
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:09,931
The Tal Shiar
are investigating

828
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,517
but preliminary reports
point to sabotage.

829
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,978
They believe that the Dominion
is responsible.

830
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:19,191
The Dominion assassinated
a Romulan Senator.

831
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:21,067
On a diplomatic mission.

832
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,861
That changes everything.

833
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:26,031
It could even bring the Romulans
into the war.

834
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,075
Excuse me.

835
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:47,635
(<i> yelling</i> )

836
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,970
(<i> grunting</i> )

837
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,013
Get up!

838
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,391
You killed him!
That's right.

839
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,935
That's what you
planned to do all
along, isn't it?

840
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,021
You knew the data rod
wouldn't hold up to scrutiny.

841
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:00,232
You just wanted to
get him on the station

842
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:01,733
so that you could plant a bomb
on his shuttle!

843
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,360
It wasn't quite that simple.

844
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,696
I did have hopes that the rod
would somehow pass inspection

845
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:07,989
but I suspected that Tolar

846
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,741
may not have been
up to the task.

847
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:12,035
And what about Tolar?
Did you kill him, too?!

848
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:15,580
Think of them both
as tragic victims of war.

849
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:18,958
If you can allow your anger

850
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,293
to subside for a moment

851
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:23,129
you'll see that they
did not die in vain!

852
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,257
The Romulans will enter the war!

853
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:27,050
There's no guarantee of that!

854
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,094
Oh, but I think that there is.

855
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:31,263
You see, when the Tal Shiar
finishes examining

856
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:32,931
the wreckage
of Vreenak's shuttle

857
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,849
they'll find
the burnt remnants

858
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,684
of a Cardassian
optolythic data rod

859
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,729
which somehow miraculously
survived the explosion.

860
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:42,232
After painstaking
forensic examination

861
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:45,318
they'll discover that the rod
contains a recording

862
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:47,237
of a high-level Dominion meeting

863
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:50,323
at which the invasion of Romulus
was being planned.

864
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:53,034
And then they'll discover
that it is a fraud!

865
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:54,994
Oh, I don't think they will

866
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,538
because any imperfections
in the forgery

867
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:01,126
will appear to be a result
of the explosion.

868
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:04,879
So, with a seemingly legitimate
rod in one hand

869
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,757
and a dead Senator
in the other...

870
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,968
I ask you, Captain

871
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,803
what conclusion would<i> you</i> draw?

872
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:17,892
That Vreenak obtained
the rod on Soukara

873
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,812
and that the Dominion killed him

874
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,522
to prevent him from returning
to Romulus with it.

875
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,358
Precisely.

876
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27,819
And the more the Dominion
protests its innocence

877
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:30,322
the more the Romulans
will believe they're guilty

878
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:32,531
because it's
<i>exactly</i> what the Romulans

879
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,492
would have done in their place.

880
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,080
That's why you came to me...

881
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,166
isn't it, Captain?

882
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,335
Because you knew

883
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,170
I could do those things

884
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,964
that you weren't capable
of doing.

885
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:50,425
Well, it worked,
and you'll get what you want--

886
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,844
a war between the Romulans
and the Dominion

887
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,054
and if your conscience
is bothering you

888
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:57,432
you should soothe it
with the knowledge

889
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:59,225
that you may
have just saved

890
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,854
the entire Alpha Quadrant,
and all it cost

891
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,564
was the life
of one Romulan Senator

892
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:07,900
one criminal...

893
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:13,906
and the self-respect
of one Starfleet Officer.

894
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:16,617
I don't know about you

895
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:19,454
but I'd call<i> that</i> a bargain.

896
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:25,418
At 0800 hours, station time...

897
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:28,338
the Romulan Empire
formally declared war

898
00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:30,382
against the Dominion.

899
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:32,925
They have already
struck 15 bases

900
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:36,221
along the Cardassian border.

901
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:37,555
So...

902
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:41,184
this is a huge victory
for the good guys.

903
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:46,105
This may even be<i> the</i> turning
point of the entire war.

904
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,900
There is even
a "welcome to the fight" party

905
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,360
tonight in the Wardroom.

906
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,111
So...

907
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,325
I lied.

908
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:58,743
I cheated.

909
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:05,833
I bribed men to cover
the crimes of other men.

910
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,671
I am an accessory

911
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:11,964
to murder.

912
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:16,219
But the most damning
thing of all...

913
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,223
I think I can live with it.

914
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:24,727
And if I had to do it
all over again...

915
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:27,480
I would.

916
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:32,693
Garak was right about one thing.

917
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:36,155
A guilty conscience
is a small price

918
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:40,326
to pay for the safety
of the Alpha Quadrant

919
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:43,246
so I will learn...

920
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:44,956
to live with it.

921
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,299
Because I<i> can</i> live with it.

922
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:00,555
I<i> can</i> live with it.

923
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:10,482
Computer...

924
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:14,819
erase that entire personal log.
