1
00:00:07,943 --> 00:00:10,039
Hey, welcome!

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,743
Well, I, for one,
never doubted

3
00:00:11,784 --> 00:00:12,843
that you'd be back.

4
00:00:12,886 --> 00:00:13,854
Neither did I.

5
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:14,857
Don't listen to him.

6
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:16,086
He was Mr. Doom and Gloom

7
00:00:16,127 --> 00:00:17,619
the entire time you were gone.

8
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:19,099
Well, I must admit,
I was a bit concerned.

9
00:00:19,134 --> 00:00:20,501
We were all concerned.

10
00:00:20,537 --> 00:00:23,373
Your well-being was a constant
source of conversation

11
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,674
and speculation.

12
00:00:24,713 --> 00:00:27,207
You see? I told you
they'd miss us.

13
00:00:27,252 --> 00:00:28,881
So, who won
the betting pool?

14
00:00:28,922 --> 00:00:30,687
Morn. He managed to guess
the day you'd be back.

15
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:32,389
Only missed the time
of your arrival by two hours.

16
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,398
He's amazing.

17
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:34,400
Don't know how he does it.

18
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,424
Mr. Worf.

19
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,597
Captain.

20
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:38,006
I know
what you're going to say.

21
00:00:38,042 --> 00:00:39,944
The answer is yes,
I did leave the station

22
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:43,077
without your permission, and
yes, I lost a runabout, but...

23
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,179
We'll evaluate

24
00:00:44,222 --> 00:00:45,782
your actions later, old man.

25
00:00:45,826 --> 00:00:47,887
Right now, I'd like to know
everything you learned

26
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,399
about
this Breen-Dominion alliance.

27
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:50,732
I'm afraid

28
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,241
we have very little information
to share with you, Captain.

29
00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:55,142
Weyoun and the others
were more interested

30
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:57,480
in asking questions
than they were answering them.

31
00:00:57,518 --> 00:01:00,719
Why do you think Damar decided
to help you escape?

32
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:03,663
I'm not sure, but I can
tell you one thing.

33
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:04,791
He hates Weyoun.

34
00:01:04,834 --> 00:01:06,633
The Cardassians
are a proud people

35
00:01:06,671 --> 00:01:09,735
but the Dominion treats them
like second-class citizens.

36
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:10,747
I think Damar is worried

37
00:01:10,781 --> 00:01:12,148
that this new alliance
with the Breen

38
00:01:12,184 --> 00:01:14,485
is going to weaken
Cardassia's status

39
00:01:14,522 --> 00:01:16,253
with the Dominion even more

40
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:20,198
but, whatever his reasons,
we owe him our lives.

41
00:01:20,234 --> 00:01:22,797
Maybe one day, you'll be able
to return the favor.

42
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,503
Uh, Doctor

43
00:01:24,544 --> 00:01:27,141
I'd like a complete medical
workup on both of them.

44
00:01:27,183 --> 00:01:29,984
Can't tell you how glad I am
to see you again.

45
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:33,694
Uh, both...
both... both of you.

46
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,495
Kira to Sisko.

47
00:01:35,535 --> 00:01:36,628
Go ahead.

48
00:01:36,671 --> 00:01:38,698
We just received
a priority-one transmission

49
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:40,267
from Starfleet Command.

50
00:01:40,312 --> 00:01:42,145
The Breen have attacked Earth.

51
00:03:47,851 --> 00:03:51,256
I had a lot of friends
in those buildings.

52
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:53,319
Starfleet was able
to destroy most

53
00:03:53,364 --> 00:03:54,993
of the Breen attack force

54
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,471
but by then, most of
the damage had been done.

55
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:00,102
We must give
the enemy credit.

56
00:04:00,145 --> 00:04:03,585
To launch an attack
on Starfleet Headquarters...

57
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:07,150
even my people
never attempted that.

58
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:11,191
We've learned one thing
about the Breen today, Captain.

59
00:04:11,236 --> 00:04:13,935
They're a race of warriors.

60
00:04:13,975 --> 00:04:15,170
That's about

61
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:16,578
all we know.

62
00:04:16,615 --> 00:04:19,713
Our intelligence reports
are sketchy at best.

63
00:04:19,754 --> 00:04:24,629
Captain, every species
has its weakness.

64
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:27,102
They're no exception.

65
00:04:27,137 --> 00:04:30,269
Let's hope you're right.

66
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:33,250
But whatever the weakness is

67
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:36,189
we better find it soon.

68
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:43,602
There. Do you see that?

69
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,907
The news from Earth
keeps getting better.

70
00:04:45,946 --> 00:04:47,609
The Federation casualty report

71
00:04:47,649 --> 00:04:50,382
is being revised
upward once again.

72
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:53,661
Well put.

73
00:04:53,696 --> 00:04:56,897
The casualties are
merely a bonus.

74
00:04:56,936 --> 00:05:00,603
What matters is that we
have struck fear

75
00:05:00,644 --> 00:05:04,015
into the heart of our enemy
and made them feel weak

76
00:05:04,052 --> 00:05:05,783
and vulnerable.

77
00:05:05,823 --> 00:05:08,386
General

78
00:05:08,429 --> 00:05:11,630
please congratulate
your troops for us.

79
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:13,161
They've done a superb job.

80
00:05:13,205 --> 00:05:14,538
Don't you agree, Damar?

81
00:05:15,644 --> 00:05:17,170
Superb.

82
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:21,352
It's unfortunate
so few of your ships

83
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,449
survived the assault.

84
00:05:22,493 --> 00:05:23,860
Leave it to you, Damar

85
00:05:23,895 --> 00:05:26,230
to point out
the one cloud in the sky.

86
00:05:27,637 --> 00:05:29,539
My thought exactly.

87
00:05:29,575 --> 00:05:31,374
It is a very small price

88
00:05:31,412 --> 00:05:33,542
for such
an important victory.

89
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,417
Now, if you'll excuse me

90
00:05:36,456 --> 00:05:38,950
I must make my report
to the Founder.

91
00:05:44,207 --> 00:05:48,581
By the way, in case Weyoun
neglected to mention it

92
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,378
the Dominion once sang
Cardassia's praises as well.

93
00:05:52,981 --> 00:05:54,678
It's really quite simple.

94
00:05:54,718 --> 00:05:57,087
They expected the war
to be over long ago.

95
00:05:57,124 --> 00:06:00,097
It's not,
and for that they blame us.

96
00:06:00,131 --> 00:06:03,400
Now, if the war
isn't ended soon

97
00:06:03,438 --> 00:06:05,169
they'll shift
the blame to you.

98
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:10,680
Well, maybe so,
but win or lose...

99
00:06:12,057 --> 00:06:14,358
I wouldn't turn my back
on Weyoun if I were you.

100
00:06:36,811 --> 00:06:38,713
Kasidy, what happened?

101
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:40,947
Uh, that's what I'm
trying to find out.

102
00:06:42,456 --> 00:06:43,720
Ow.

103
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,750
What are you... you doing?

104
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:45,763
You don't cook.

105
00:06:45,797 --> 00:06:48,360
I-I know.
I was just making sure.

106
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,602
Oh, my... my peppers.

107
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:54,477
I-I know how you like

108
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:56,544
roasted peppers
in your casserole.

109
00:06:56,588 --> 00:06:58,581
Took me three months
to grow them.

110
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:02,031
Nobody touches my peppers.

111
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:04,538
I'm so sorry.

112
00:07:07,378 --> 00:07:09,542
With all the bad
news about Earth

113
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,522
I wanted to do
something nice for you.

114
00:07:12,556 --> 00:07:14,925
But from now on

115
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:17,797
you wear the apron
in the family.

116
00:07:17,835 --> 00:07:19,828
You know, that's a good idea.

117
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:22,173
Glad you're not mad.

118
00:07:22,211 --> 00:07:23,304
Wouldn't want anything

119
00:07:23,346 --> 00:07:25,248
to ruin our last
few nights together.

120
00:07:25,284 --> 00:07:27,653
Our last few nights together?

121
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,851
My cargo run.

122
00:07:28,892 --> 00:07:30,361
I leave early next week.

123
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:31,831
No, you're not going anywhere.

124
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:32,993
It's too dangerous.

125
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,937
Ben, the Breen attacked Earth.

126
00:07:34,972 --> 00:07:36,839
That's not exactly next door.

127
00:07:36,877 --> 00:07:39,212
We don't know where they're
going to attack next.

128
00:07:39,248 --> 00:07:41,776
I would feel better
if you were closer to me.

129
00:07:41,821 --> 00:07:43,381
Well, that's sweet.

130
00:07:43,424 --> 00:07:44,585
But I'm going anyway.

131
00:07:46,164 --> 00:07:48,567
I can't talk you out of it?

132
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:50,435
Not a chance.

133
00:07:53,714 --> 00:07:54,978
Enter.

134
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:03,965
The information you requested.

135
00:08:04,002 --> 00:08:05,528
Excellent.

136
00:08:05,573 --> 00:08:06,940
Sit down.

137
00:08:06,976 --> 00:08:09,949
I'm not sure it's
wise for me to stay.

138
00:08:09,982 --> 00:08:12,180
What if the Vorta decides
to pay you a visit?

139
00:08:12,221 --> 00:08:13,588
And what if he does?

140
00:08:13,624 --> 00:08:16,289
He'll see me conferring
with one of my officers.

141
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,298
There's nothing suspicious

142
00:08:17,332 --> 00:08:18,631
about that.

143
00:08:21,006 --> 00:08:25,642
Doesn't seem right...
all this plotting and secrecy.

144
00:08:25,683 --> 00:08:27,619
What are we... Romulans?

145
00:08:27,654 --> 00:08:29,385
No, we're Cardassians

146
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,990
but right now, Cardassia's
an occupied territory

147
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:34,593
and to defeat an occupying army

148
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:36,368
takes careful planning
and secrecy.

149
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:38,970
Can we really hope
to defeat the Dominion?

150
00:08:39,013 --> 00:08:41,348
With the Breen on their side,
they're stronger than ever.

151
00:08:41,385 --> 00:08:43,913
But we will be fighting
to win back our homes

152
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:47,158
and our freedom, and that
will make us even stronger.

153
00:08:49,268 --> 00:08:51,170
I remember the day
I heard the news

154
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:53,804
that Cardassia had
joined the Dominion.

155
00:08:53,846 --> 00:08:57,753
Like everyone else,
I rejoiced.

156
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,191
We were going to be rulers
of the entire Alpha Quadrant.

157
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:06,706
Instead, we're a
conquered people...

158
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,075
servants in our own land.

159
00:09:09,112 --> 00:09:11,082
All that will soon end.

160
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,821
Now, are you sure we can trust
these officers?

161
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,329
And the troops
under their command.

162
00:09:17,364 --> 00:09:21,305
Still, it's not a
very long list, is it?

163
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:22,672
It will get longer.

164
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,234
With a victory or two

165
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:26,842
all Cardassia
will rise up with us.

166
00:09:28,588 --> 00:09:30,387
We'll need to know
the exact location

167
00:09:30,426 --> 00:09:32,328
of the Dominion
weapon emplacements

168
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,662
on Rondac III.

169
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,135
Leave that to me.

170
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:38,974
Now, I want you
to get a message

171
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,878
to every one
of these officers.

172
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:48,931
Regarding your
scheduled retreat

173
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:50,459
to the Calash Monastery?

174
00:09:50,503 --> 00:09:52,667
Cancel it.

175
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:53,972
Very good.

176
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:55,104
Now, about your appearance

177
00:09:55,146 --> 00:09:57,481
before the Vedek Assembly?

178
00:09:57,518 --> 00:09:59,545
Cancel that, too.

179
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:03,086
Cancel an appearance
before the Vedek Assembly?

180
00:10:03,131 --> 00:10:04,600
Just do it.

181
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:06,297
Cancel everything.

182
00:10:06,338 --> 00:10:08,103
As you wish.

183
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:10,613
May I ask what, exactly,
you will be doing?

184
00:10:10,714 --> 00:10:13,846
You certainly may not.

185
00:10:13,888 --> 00:10:18,490
But if you must know,
I'll be devoting most of my time

186
00:10:18,531 --> 00:10:20,364
to study and meditation.

187
00:10:23,743 --> 00:10:25,406
I see.

188
00:10:25,447 --> 00:10:26,540
Solbor

189
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:30,022
I'll have my breakfast
on the balcony this morning.

190
00:10:30,057 --> 00:10:33,224
Eminence, is there
anything you would like?

191
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:34,858
I'm not hungry.

192
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,495
Oh, but you
really should eat.

193
00:10:36,538 --> 00:10:40,445
After all, Bajor
is only as strong as its Kai.

194
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,815
I said, I'm not hungry.

195
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,618
Do as he asks.

196
00:10:45,658 --> 00:10:49,029
And please...
write a note to the vedeks

197
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,967
expressing my apologies

198
00:10:51,002 --> 00:10:52,869
for having
to postpone our meeting.

199
00:10:52,907 --> 00:10:55,140
I'll see to it immediately.

200
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,690
What a tiresome little man.

201
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:07,202
Sometimes I think you
forget your place, Anjohl.

202
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:11,681
Oh, forgive me
if I've offended you in any way.

203
00:11:11,748 --> 00:11:18,925
I am but a moon made warm
by the light of your sun.

204
00:11:18,964 --> 00:11:21,731
I hope you're a better farmer
than you are a poet.

205
00:11:26,213 --> 00:11:28,582
Something is wrong.

206
00:11:28,618 --> 00:11:32,855
Tell me...
what's bothering you?

207
00:11:34,131 --> 00:11:39,200
Everything... the prayers,
the rituals, these robes.

208
00:11:39,242 --> 00:11:43,547
I can't keep pretending I follow
the path of the Prophets.

209
00:11:43,585 --> 00:11:46,216
You won't have to.

210
00:11:46,257 --> 00:11:49,492
The Pah-wraiths
are waiting to embrace you.

211
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:50,760
So you keep saying.

212
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:52,736
But when is that
going to happen?

213
00:11:52,771 --> 00:11:55,972
As soon as we release them
from the fire caves.

214
00:11:56,012 --> 00:11:57,572
Release them?

215
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,712
But the Prophecies.

216
00:11:59,754 --> 00:12:01,280
What about them?

217
00:12:01,324 --> 00:12:02,314
Well, they warn

218
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,920
that the release
of the Pah-wraiths

219
00:12:03,963 --> 00:12:05,660
will mean the end of Bajor.

220
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,696
The old Bajor, perhaps.

221
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,945
But from its ashes
a new Bajor will arise

222
00:12:13,985 --> 00:12:16,548
and the Restoration will begin.

223
00:12:16,591 --> 00:12:18,652
Who will be left to see it?

224
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:21,132
Those the Gods find worthy.

225
00:12:22,136 --> 00:12:26,009
It will be the dawn
of paradise

226
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:30,715
and you, Adami,
are destined to rule it.

227
00:12:32,192 --> 00:12:33,661
You're sure of that?

228
00:12:33,695 --> 00:12:35,392
It is meant to be.

229
00:12:35,432 --> 00:12:37,596
And what will become of you?

230
00:12:37,637 --> 00:12:43,378
Oh, I will be at your side
for as long as you need me.

231
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:47,414
But first, we have
to release the Pah-wraiths.

232
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:49,692
But how do we do that?

233
00:12:49,731 --> 00:12:53,102
The answer is in the text
of the <i>Kosst Amojan.</i>

234
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,733
Oh...

235
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:58,978
It is forbidden for anyone
to open that book.

236
00:12:59,017 --> 00:13:02,958
Yes... anyone except the Kai.

237
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:06,022
It is said
to contain great evil.

238
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,068
You have nothing to fear.

239
00:13:10,108 --> 00:13:12,602
I'll be right there with you.

240
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:15,950
Did I say I was afraid?

241
00:13:28,382 --> 00:13:30,683
Here, this palisade
in the south wall...

242
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,813
if only we could make

243
00:13:31,856 --> 00:13:34,089
this part of the compound
less vulnerable.

244
00:13:34,128 --> 00:13:35,323
What are you talking about?

245
00:13:35,363 --> 00:13:36,855
The south wall
isn't the problem.

246
00:13:36,934 --> 00:13:39,998
They came over the north wall,
by Travis's position.

247
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,102
I know where they came from,
Miles.

248
00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:44,446
I am Travis, remember?

249
00:13:44,484 --> 00:13:46,477
And I say we strengthen
the south wall, the north wall

250
00:13:46,522 --> 00:13:48,686
and any other place that helps
us keep the enemy out.

251
00:13:48,726 --> 00:13:50,890
Then it wouldn't be the battle
of the Alamo, would it?

252
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:52,159
I don't care.

253
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,571
I just want to win once.

254
00:13:53,704 --> 00:13:54,797
Be Santa Anna.

255
00:13:54,841 --> 00:13:56,070
He wins every time.

256
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,237
What if we put cannons

257
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,010
along the long barracks
like this?

258
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,351
Hey, hey, what do you think
you're doing?!

259
00:14:01,388 --> 00:14:03,153
Do you know how long it took me
to build this thing?

260
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:04,957
I don't believe the two of you.

261
00:14:04,996 --> 00:14:06,795
Your homeworld has been attacked

262
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,359
the Breen have joined forces
with the Dominion

263
00:14:08,404 --> 00:14:11,274
and here you are,
calmly playing games.

264
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,746
Haven't you ever heard
of grace under pressure, Quark?

265
00:14:13,782 --> 00:14:16,049
Shouldn't you be doing something
more productive?

266
00:14:16,087 --> 00:14:18,388
I just spent 14 hours

267
00:14:18,426 --> 00:14:20,863
recalibrating the station's
weapons array.

268
00:14:20,898 --> 00:14:22,162
And I just did
a complete run-through

269
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,136
of the emergency support team
protocols.

270
00:14:24,172 --> 00:14:27,873
So... you do expect
an attack on the station.

271
00:14:27,913 --> 00:14:29,439
Anything's possible.

272
00:14:29,483 --> 00:14:31,146
What about a moat?

273
00:14:31,187 --> 00:14:33,681
A moat?
Around the Alamo?

274
00:14:33,726 --> 00:14:34,694
Yes. Here, look.

275
00:14:34,728 --> 00:14:35,821
We could widen this stream

276
00:14:35,864 --> 00:14:36,991
maybe make it
a little deeper.

277
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:39,334
I say we build a moat
around the station.

278
00:14:46,821 --> 00:14:48,586
He is a child.

279
00:14:50,062 --> 00:14:52,533
Miles does have a certain...
cherubic quality.

280
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:53,535
I was talking

281
00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:55,436
about Dr. Bashir
and you know it.

282
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:02,310
Are you certain he's the one?

283
00:15:03,758 --> 00:15:06,059
I'm not certain about anything.

284
00:15:07,634 --> 00:15:08,967
But he is handsome.

285
00:15:09,003 --> 00:15:11,873
You deserve more than handsome.

286
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,473
He gets excited
playing with toys.

287
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:16,782
He knows
how to have a good time.

288
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:18,985
Besides, it's not exactly a toy.

289
00:15:19,026 --> 00:15:21,691
You heard the Chief.
He spent hours making that.

290
00:15:24,304 --> 00:15:27,539
I see it is hopeless
to try to reason with you.

291
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,650
I know.

292
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:33,245
Maybe I am in love with him.

293
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,420
Do you think I should tell him
how I feel?

294
00:15:36,598 --> 00:15:38,865
If it will make you happy, yes.

295
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,070
You're a good friend, Worf.

296
00:15:43,111 --> 00:15:44,910
I know.

297
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,930
They are wasting their time.

298
00:15:51,964 --> 00:15:53,957
No matter how much planning
they do

299
00:15:54,002 --> 00:15:56,098
there is no way that they
can defend that mission

300
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,509
against an enemy that numbers
in the thousands

301
00:15:58,545 --> 00:15:59,980
not without more men.

302
00:16:00,016 --> 00:16:02,579
You know, if you want to go
down there and help them...

303
00:16:04,892 --> 00:16:06,759
Just a thought.

304
00:16:21,697 --> 00:16:22,824
Damar.

305
00:16:22,865 --> 00:16:24,732
You're up early.

306
00:16:25,772 --> 00:16:26,705
Am I?

307
00:16:26,808 --> 00:16:28,175
Yes, you are

308
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,237
or you haven't
been to bed yet.

309
00:16:32,152 --> 00:16:34,248
Actually,
I had a very restful sleep.

310
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,350
Did you?

311
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:39,534
How nice.

312
00:16:39,569 --> 00:16:41,436
I had no idea
the Breen could mobilize

313
00:16:41,473 --> 00:16:43,443
such a large fleet
so quickly.

314
00:16:43,478 --> 00:16:45,175
Our new allies
are full of surprises

315
00:16:45,215 --> 00:16:46,240
aren't they?

316
00:16:46,283 --> 00:16:47,251
Hmm.

317
00:16:47,285 --> 00:16:49,950
You know those refrigeration
suits they wear?

318
00:16:49,992 --> 00:16:51,017
What about them?

319
00:16:51,061 --> 00:16:52,928
I'm sure you've read
the intelligence reports

320
00:16:52,965 --> 00:16:55,766
that say that their homeworld
is a frozen wasteland.

321
00:16:55,872 --> 00:16:57,273
Well, it's not.

322
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:00,940
The climate on their home
planet is quite comfortable.

323
00:17:00,983 --> 00:17:03,044
Then why do they wear
refrigeration suits?

324
00:17:03,087 --> 00:17:04,077
They won't say.

325
00:17:04,122 --> 00:17:05,181
You see what I mean?

326
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:06,990
They're full of surprises.

327
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:13,570
There's something...

328
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,877
different
about you today, Damar.

329
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,715
I can't quite put
my finger on it.

330
00:17:17,753 --> 00:17:19,883
It's almost as if
you're only...

331
00:17:19,924 --> 00:17:21,621
half-dressed.

332
00:17:21,661 --> 00:17:23,494
What are you talking about?

333
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:26,664
You don't have a
bottle in your hand.

334
00:17:26,706 --> 00:17:29,143
Don't you have anything
better to do than to?

335
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:31,479
You've regained your confidence.

336
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:34,683
I wasn't aware that I'd lost it.

337
00:17:34,723 --> 00:17:36,249
Come now, Damar.

338
00:17:36,293 --> 00:17:39,026
You thought you backed
the wrong side.

339
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:42,528
You thought the Dominion
was going to lose this war

340
00:17:42,574 --> 00:17:44,807
and drag Cardassia
down with it.

341
00:17:44,879 --> 00:17:49,048
I must admit,
things were looking rather grim.

342
00:17:49,088 --> 00:17:51,321
Perhaps, for a moment or two.

343
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,831
That's no excuse
to lose faith in oneself

344
00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:55,425
or one's allies.

345
00:17:55,469 --> 00:17:57,838
But now...

346
00:17:57,874 --> 00:18:02,316
it's as if you've groped
your way through a dark tunnel

347
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,517
and stepped back out
into the light once again.

348
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:07,528
You know what
that light's told you?

349
00:18:07,563 --> 00:18:10,559
That the Dominion
will prevail...

350
00:18:10,602 --> 00:18:13,130
that the Federation

351
00:18:13,174 --> 00:18:14,403
will be conquered

352
00:18:14,444 --> 00:18:16,346
and a new era
of peace and prosperity

353
00:18:16,381 --> 00:18:18,750
will blanket the
Alpha Quadrant.

354
00:18:18,787 --> 00:18:21,224
You know me so well.

355
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:23,958
Really, Damar...

356
00:18:23,998 --> 00:18:25,365
I hope you won't let

357
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:27,838
that Cardassian-
sized ego of yours

358
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,136
spoil our victory...

359
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:31,112
and I do mean our victory.

360
00:18:31,147 --> 00:18:32,514
Yours, mine...

361
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,518
And the Breen.

362
00:18:33,553 --> 00:18:35,079
Yes, and the Breen.

363
00:18:35,123 --> 00:18:37,754
We're just one big,
happy family, aren't we?

364
00:18:38,964 --> 00:18:41,960
I like it so much
better when we agree.

365
00:18:42,005 --> 00:18:43,838
Don't you?

366
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:54,892
The text

367
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:58,200
of the <i>Kosst Amojan,</i>
as you requested.

368
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,176
Very good.

369
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,282
Well...

370
00:19:04,321 --> 00:19:06,018
put it on my desk.

371
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:08,689
Eminence, may I speak frankly?

372
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,359
If you must.

373
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,498
This book has not been removed
from the Archives

374
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:16,571
not for 700 years.

375
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,674
Your point being?

376
00:19:19,954 --> 00:19:22,448
The knowledge it contains...

377
00:19:22,493 --> 00:19:25,158
about the Pah-wraiths...

378
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,471
it is said to be
very dangerous.

379
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:31,172
Knowledge is
never dangerous

380
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:33,012
in the right hands.

381
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,610
There is an old saying...

382
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:37,751
he who studies evil...

383
00:19:37,794 --> 00:19:41,063
is studied by evil.

384
00:19:41,101 --> 00:19:43,766
I will keep that in mind.

385
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,905
Now give me the book.

386
00:19:49,386 --> 00:19:54,091
Your concern for her Eminence
is appreciated

387
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:56,293
and acknowledged.

388
00:19:56,334 --> 00:19:59,307
Nevertheless, you
must do as she says.

389
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,836
I will see to it that
no harm comes to her.

390
00:20:02,882 --> 00:20:05,217
There. That should make you
feel better.

391
00:20:05,254 --> 00:20:09,093
I wish it could,
but this man...

392
00:20:09,129 --> 00:20:11,794
one day he comes
onto Deep Space 9

393
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:12,803
and the next

394
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:16,005
he's become
your closest advisor.

395
00:20:16,111 --> 00:20:18,674
What do we know of him?

396
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,382
Where did he come from?

397
00:20:21,423 --> 00:20:23,325
What does he want?

398
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,027
I want only to serve the Kai.

399
00:20:27,135 --> 00:20:29,936
This is his idea, isn't it?

400
00:20:29,975 --> 00:20:32,572
To study this hateful book.

401
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:36,179
Anjohl was sent to me
by the Prophets.

402
00:20:36,222 --> 00:20:37,953
That's all I need to know

403
00:20:37,993 --> 00:20:40,966
and that's all anyone
needs to know.

404
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:43,766
I have no idea why I was chosen

405
00:20:43,805 --> 00:20:49,044
but who are we to question
the ways of the Prophets?

406
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,019
Perhaps you should go
to the temple

407
00:20:51,054 --> 00:20:53,184
and ask
the Prophets' forgiveness

408
00:20:53,226 --> 00:20:55,219
for questioning their wisdom.

409
00:21:10,864 --> 00:21:13,529
Solbor does not approve of me.

410
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:17,237
He has served me
well for many years.

411
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:20,411
And he may serve you well
for many more

412
00:21:20,453 --> 00:21:22,446
if the Pah-wraiths
find him worthy.

413
00:21:24,962 --> 00:21:27,058
Well?

414
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:29,094
Aren't you going to open it?

415
00:21:35,552 --> 00:21:39,994
The Pah-wraiths are not evil

416
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:42,694
but they are powerful

417
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:46,071
and they're willing to share
that power with you.

418
00:21:46,108 --> 00:21:49,650
The question is:
Do you want it?

419
00:21:59,205 --> 00:22:00,434
Yes.

420
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,501
This can't be.

421
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:32,204
This is a trick.

422
00:22:35,518 --> 00:22:37,454
It's not a trick.

423
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,425
Well, then Solbor brought
the wrong book.

424
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:42,363
He doesn't make those
kinds of mistakes.

425
00:22:46,174 --> 00:22:47,541
The words are here.

426
00:22:47,578 --> 00:22:49,708
They're just
hidden, that's all.

427
00:22:49,749 --> 00:22:52,585
It's up to us to find them.

428
00:23:01,342 --> 00:23:03,939
These are the new security
protocols you requested.

429
00:23:03,981 --> 00:23:05,575
Very good.

430
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:07,087
Although, frankly,
I'm not sure

431
00:23:07,121 --> 00:23:09,319
how effective they'll
be against the Breen.

432
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:10,851
Neither am I.

433
00:23:10,896 --> 00:23:12,798
I just hope we don't
have to find out.

434
00:23:13,802 --> 00:23:14,701
Benjamin?

435
00:23:14,804 --> 00:23:16,774
You mind explaining this?

436
00:23:18,445 --> 00:23:20,916
Constable, do you mind if we use
your office for a moment?

437
00:23:20,951 --> 00:23:22,443
Not at all.

438
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:29,393
Well, it looks like

439
00:23:29,436 --> 00:23:31,566
the Bajoran Freight
and Shipping Authority

440
00:23:31,608 --> 00:23:33,134
wants you to take
a vacation.

441
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,376
A month's paid vacation?

442
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:36,851
This is your doing,
isn't it?

443
00:23:36,886 --> 00:23:38,549
Let me guess.

444
00:23:38,589 --> 00:23:40,559
The Emissary asked
for a little favor.

445
00:23:40,594 --> 00:23:43,157
I never once mentioned
the word "Emissary."

446
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,863
But you did arrange this.

447
00:23:44,904 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm just trying to keep you
out of harm's way.

448
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:49,774
Is that such a terrible thing
for a husband to do?

449
00:23:49,848 --> 00:23:50,873
I told you.

450
00:23:50,917 --> 00:23:52,910
I don't need or want
that kind of protection.

451
00:23:52,954 --> 00:23:54,890
I want you to call
whoever you called

452
00:23:54,926 --> 00:23:56,725
and have them put me
back on the active list.

453
00:23:56,763 --> 00:23:57,788
Kasidy, it's only for a month.

454
00:23:57,898 --> 00:23:58,797
I don't care

455
00:23:58,901 --> 00:24:00,530
if it's only for a day.

456
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:03,841
How would you like it if I
called Admiral Ross and said

457
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:05,746
"Oh, do me a favor.
Please don't send

458
00:24:05,783 --> 00:24:07,947
my husband on any dangerous
missions this month"?

459
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,753
Look, that's not the same thing.

460
00:24:09,792 --> 00:24:11,990
It is from where I'm standing.

461
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:16,199
My job is just as important
to me as your job is to you.

462
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:17,229
I know that.

463
00:24:25,794 --> 00:24:27,764
What's so funny?

464
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:32,673
Marriage...
it changes everything.

465
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:35,077
If you're not careful

466
00:24:35,114 --> 00:24:37,175
that could be you and Kira.

467
00:24:37,219 --> 00:24:38,483
Huh.

468
00:24:58,499 --> 00:25:00,526
Here are the other volumes

469
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,765
you wanted.

470
00:25:01,806 --> 00:25:02,933
Thank you, Solbor.

471
00:25:02,975 --> 00:25:03,965
You may go now.

472
00:25:04,946 --> 00:25:06,039
Eminence

473
00:25:06,082 --> 00:25:07,311
I must inform you

474
00:25:07,352 --> 00:25:08,787
that the archivists
are very...

475
00:25:08,821 --> 00:25:10,347
You heard the Kai.

476
00:25:11,193 --> 00:25:12,161
Leave us.

477
00:25:12,195 --> 00:25:13,322
They're wondering

478
00:25:13,365 --> 00:25:18,604
why you need to consult
so many of these dark texts.

479
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:22,812
You may tell them that their Kai
works for the good of Bajor.

480
00:25:22,852 --> 00:25:24,047
Now leave me.

481
00:25:24,088 --> 00:25:25,955
I have work to do.

482
00:25:35,781 --> 00:25:38,082
Why are you still here?

483
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,611
What would you like me to do?

484
00:25:39,655 --> 00:25:41,648
Go away.

485
00:25:41,694 --> 00:25:43,493
I don't understand.

486
00:25:43,531 --> 00:25:45,330
I must concentrate.

487
00:25:45,368 --> 00:25:46,393
But, Your Eminence...

488
00:25:46,438 --> 00:25:48,909
Not another word.

489
00:25:48,943 --> 00:25:51,312
Very well.

490
00:26:03,742 --> 00:26:05,507
They're beautiful.

491
00:26:05,545 --> 00:26:07,139
Then you forgive me?

492
00:26:07,182 --> 00:26:08,776
Uh, that depends.

493
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:11,986
Have you talked to Bajoran
Freight and Shipping?

494
00:26:12,027 --> 00:26:13,222
You're back on the active list.

495
00:26:13,263 --> 00:26:15,598
Then I forgive you.

496
00:26:15,634 --> 00:26:16,898
But, from here on in...

497
00:26:16,937 --> 00:26:18,166
I'm not to interfere
with your work

498
00:26:18,207 --> 00:26:20,006
unless you tell me to.

499
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:23,710
Or it's absolutely
necessary.

500
00:26:23,752 --> 00:26:25,153
I'm just joking.

501
00:26:25,189 --> 00:26:26,818
You'd better be.

502
00:26:31,837 --> 00:26:33,170
What's that for?

503
00:26:33,207 --> 00:26:34,506
The flowers.

504
00:26:34,543 --> 00:26:39,248
And for being big enough
to admit when you're wrong.

505
00:26:40,389 --> 00:26:43,658
Ah, that must be Quark
with the necklace.

506
00:26:43,696 --> 00:26:44,789
The necklace?

507
00:26:44,832 --> 00:26:47,303
Just in case
the flowers didn't work.

508
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:52,080
Ben, the Breen have launched

509
00:26:52,115 --> 00:26:53,982
a counteroffensive
against our forces

510
00:26:54,086 --> 00:26:55,350
in the Chin'toka system.

511
00:26:55,389 --> 00:26:56,550
Have they broken through?

512
00:26:56,592 --> 00:26:58,391
In two places.

513
00:27:02,438 --> 00:27:04,841
When do I leave?

514
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:17,704
This is bad... very bad.

515
00:27:17,738 --> 00:27:20,905
You say that every time we take
the <i>Defiant</i> into battle

516
00:27:20,945 --> 00:27:23,416
Impulse manifold
purged and clear.

517
00:27:23,451 --> 00:27:25,080
If we lose the
Chin'toka system

518
00:27:25,121 --> 00:27:28,390
we lose our only foothold
in the Dominion territory.

519
00:27:28,428 --> 00:27:30,091
I think that
qualifies as bad.

520
00:27:30,132 --> 00:27:31,692
Well, we haven't lost it yet.

521
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:34,229
Initiating impulse
pre-start sequence.

522
00:27:34,274 --> 00:27:36,370
Microfusion
generators on line.

523
00:27:36,412 --> 00:27:39,316
But the Breen, they
seem unstoppable.

524
00:27:39,352 --> 00:27:41,151
First Earth, now Chin'toka?

525
00:27:41,189 --> 00:27:43,956
Ensign, no one is unstoppable.

526
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,862
Collimate
the nadion emitters.

527
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,201
Collimation sequence
in progress.

528
00:27:48,238 --> 00:27:50,607
What more can I say, Miles,
but I'm sorry?

529
00:27:50,643 --> 00:27:53,639
Dilithium matrix
is aligned and calibrated.

530
00:27:53,683 --> 00:27:55,277
Just be a bit more careful.

531
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,687
That's all I ask.

532
00:27:56,724 --> 00:27:59,195
Opening antimatter
injector ports.

533
00:27:59,229 --> 00:28:00,994
Trouble in paradise?

534
00:28:01,033 --> 00:28:02,092
It was nothing.

535
00:28:02,135 --> 00:28:03,695
Emergency life-support
and damage control systems

536
00:28:03,739 --> 00:28:04,707
standing by.

537
00:28:04,741 --> 00:28:06,506
I wouldn't call it nothing.

538
00:28:06,545 --> 00:28:08,709
Autonomous guidance system
initialized and active.

539
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,014
He lost Travis.

540
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,589
Hmm. Sounds serious.

541
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,616
Verify astrometric database.

542
00:28:13,661 --> 00:28:16,030
Miles built this Alamo model

543
00:28:16,066 --> 00:28:17,660
replete with small figures.

544
00:28:17,703 --> 00:28:19,434
Quite spectacular, actually.

545
00:28:19,473 --> 00:28:21,637
Datasets loaded and verified.

546
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,980
Anyway, he was showing it to me
in Quark's when we...

547
00:28:24,016 --> 00:28:27,251
rather, l... accidentally
misplaced Colonel Travis.

548
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,021
Phaser safeties engaged.

549
00:28:29,061 --> 00:28:30,826
Can't you make another one?

550
00:28:30,865 --> 00:28:32,698
What, so he can
lose it again?

551
00:28:32,736 --> 00:28:35,037
Field stabilizers on line.

552
00:28:35,075 --> 00:28:38,014
Well, that's what happens
when you share your toys.

553
00:28:38,047 --> 00:28:39,015
Synchronizing

554
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:40,017
warp plasma flow.

555
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,281
It's not a toy.

556
00:28:41,321 --> 00:28:43,052
It's a model built to scale.

557
00:28:43,092 --> 00:28:45,188
He really did
a fantastic job.

558
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,599
Nacelles holding
at pre-warp threshold.

559
00:28:47,636 --> 00:28:48,763
Miles, look...

560
00:28:48,804 --> 00:28:50,467
He plays with toys.

561
00:28:50,508 --> 00:28:51,943
It's a model.

562
00:28:51,978 --> 00:28:53,277
With little figures.

563
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,952
Captain on the Bridge!

564
00:28:56,989 --> 00:28:58,686
Commander.

565
00:28:58,726 --> 00:29:00,059
Weapons array is on line.

566
00:29:00,096 --> 00:29:01,622
Phasers are fully charged.

567
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:04,764
Quantum torpedo launchers
are loaded and standing by.

568
00:29:04,806 --> 00:29:07,403
Colonel, set a course
to rendezvous

569
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:09,472
with the Federation
Assault Fleet.

570
00:29:10,485 --> 00:29:12,079
Course set.

571
00:29:12,122 --> 00:29:13,785
Take us out.

572
00:29:13,826 --> 00:29:15,728
Airlocks are sealed.

573
00:29:15,763 --> 00:29:18,462
Releasing docking clamps.

574
00:29:53,747 --> 00:29:55,225
Where are you going
with those?

575
00:29:55,358 --> 00:29:57,761
I'm returning these
books to the Archives.

576
00:29:57,797 --> 00:29:58,787
On whose authority?

577
00:29:58,832 --> 00:29:59,800
I believe

578
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:01,861
her Eminence has finished.

579
00:30:01,906 --> 00:30:03,135
Put them back.

580
00:30:03,175 --> 00:30:05,373
How dare you use
that tone with me...

581
00:30:19,378 --> 00:30:21,007
I'll put them back.

582
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:48,671
Wake up, my love.

583
00:30:48,709 --> 00:30:51,306
There's work to be done.

584
00:30:51,348 --> 00:30:53,181
Oh, Anjohl.

585
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,689
I must have dozed off.

586
00:30:55,724 --> 00:30:57,125
You're tired.

587
00:30:57,161 --> 00:30:58,425
It's understandable.

588
00:31:00,468 --> 00:31:02,666
I haven't made
much progress.

589
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:06,580
You'll find the answers
we're looking for.

590
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,277
It's just a matter of time.

591
00:31:08,318 --> 00:31:11,314
Oh, I'm so glad
you're here.

592
00:31:11,358 --> 00:31:12,691
Hmm.

593
00:31:12,728 --> 00:31:15,963
I'll see that you're
brought something to eat.

594
00:31:16,002 --> 00:31:17,095
Hmm?

595
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,532
According to the latest
battle reports

596
00:31:30,567 --> 00:31:32,264
it looks as if the Dominion
is going to retake

597
00:31:32,304 --> 00:31:33,431
Chin'toka.

598
00:31:33,473 --> 00:31:36,913
A few months ago,
the thought of the Federation

599
00:31:36,948 --> 00:31:38,349
being driven
from Cardassian soil

600
00:31:38,384 --> 00:31:40,149
would've been a cause
for celebration

601
00:31:40,188 --> 00:31:43,593
but the Dominion victories
are no longer our victories.

602
00:31:46,569 --> 00:31:49,633
Now, are our troops
in position?

603
00:31:49,676 --> 00:31:52,170
They're awaiting your command.

604
00:31:52,215 --> 00:31:53,183
Excellent.

605
00:31:53,217 --> 00:31:54,846
We attack in seven hours.

606
00:31:57,693 --> 00:32:01,224
We're going to lose
many fine soldiers.

607
00:32:02,604 --> 00:32:04,574
At least they'll be dying
for Cardassia

608
00:32:04,609 --> 00:32:06,876
and not the Dominion.

609
00:32:14,965 --> 00:32:16,992
The Federation reinforcements

610
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:18,869
are approaching Chin'toka.

611
00:32:18,907 --> 00:32:21,208
The more of them, the better.

612
00:32:21,245 --> 00:32:24,218
Founder, it concerns me

613
00:32:24,251 --> 00:32:26,187
to have you this
close to the front.

614
00:32:26,223 --> 00:32:29,526
You're concern is noted.

615
00:32:29,564 --> 00:32:33,403
But this is one battle
I intend to see firsthand.

616
00:32:33,438 --> 00:32:35,067
Yes.

617
00:32:35,142 --> 00:32:37,112
It should be
most gratifying.

618
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,490
Romulan attack wings
three and nine

619
00:32:45,532 --> 00:32:47,365
have reached the line
of deployment.

620
00:32:47,403 --> 00:32:49,236
Federation fighter squadrons

621
00:32:49,273 --> 00:32:51,106
seven and ten,
break into sections

622
00:32:51,145 --> 00:32:53,012
and stand by to begin
reconnaissance sweep.

623
00:32:54,418 --> 00:32:57,288
Lead units
assume attack positions.

624
00:32:57,324 --> 00:32:58,657
Advance to contact.

625
00:33:29,428 --> 00:33:30,897
Sir, they've locked weapons
on us.

626
00:33:30,931 --> 00:33:33,425
All auxiliary power
to forward shields.

627
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,737
Colonel, attack pattern delta.

628
00:33:35,776 --> 00:33:36,744
Aye, sir.

629
00:33:36,778 --> 00:33:38,543
Mr. Worf, quantum torpedoes.

630
00:33:38,581 --> 00:33:39,982
Target locked.

631
00:33:41,755 --> 00:33:43,247
Fire.

632
00:33:54,717 --> 00:33:56,118
Target locked.

633
00:33:56,153 --> 00:33:58,020
Launchers one
and two standing by.

634
00:33:58,058 --> 00:33:59,151
Fire.

635
00:34:20,674 --> 00:34:22,268
What the hell is?!

636
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:31,828
We've lost power to the helm.

637
00:34:31,865 --> 00:34:33,094
The com's out.

638
00:34:33,135 --> 00:34:34,103
So are weapons.

639
00:34:34,137 --> 00:34:36,198
Primary computer systems
are off-line.

640
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,473
Manual controls are frozen.

641
00:34:40,518 --> 00:34:42,215
Chief.

642
00:34:42,322 --> 00:34:43,312
I can't get anything

643
00:34:43,357 --> 00:34:44,518
back on line.

644
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:46,586
Somehow, they're draining
all our power.

645
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:55,611
The fire-suppression system's
off-line!

646
00:34:55,651 --> 00:34:57,177
Use the manual extinguishers.

647
00:34:57,221 --> 00:34:58,416
I'm on it.

648
00:34:58,457 --> 00:35:00,826
We're venting plasma coolant

649
00:35:00,862 --> 00:35:03,026
from over eight
separate EPS ruptures.

650
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:04,935
The air's becoming toxic,
Captain.

651
00:35:04,972 --> 00:35:06,669
Sir, the ablative armor
is starting to buckle.

652
00:35:06,709 --> 00:35:07,699
We have hull breaches

653
00:35:07,744 --> 00:35:09,179
on decks 3 and 4.

654
00:35:09,214 --> 00:35:10,843
Without power for the
emergency force fields

655
00:35:10,884 --> 00:35:12,011
there's no way to seal them.

656
00:35:13,825 --> 00:35:15,124
Abandon ship.

657
00:35:18,401 --> 00:35:19,369
You heard me.

658
00:35:19,403 --> 00:35:22,706
Everyone get to the escape pods.
Now.

659
00:35:37,142 --> 00:35:38,269
Captain...

660
00:35:41,352 --> 00:35:42,685
She's a fine ship.

661
00:35:42,721 --> 00:35:44,020
No one will argue
with that.

662
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,891
But like you say,
it's time to go.

663
00:36:15,426 --> 00:36:17,020
Poor Captain Sisko.

664
00:36:17,063 --> 00:36:19,933
I believe he was quite fond
of that ship.

665
00:36:22,809 --> 00:36:25,303
Founder, I'm happy to report

666
00:36:25,381 --> 00:36:28,616
that the Chin'toka system
is ours once again.

667
00:36:28,655 --> 00:36:31,491
A step in the right direction.

668
00:36:31,529 --> 00:36:34,559
Send my compliments
to the Breen.

669
00:36:34,601 --> 00:36:36,731
I'm certain
that will please them greatly.

670
00:36:36,773 --> 00:36:38,606
Really?

671
00:36:38,644 --> 00:36:41,981
I have no idea what would please
the Breen, nor do I care

672
00:36:42,018 --> 00:36:44,683
as long as they fight and win.

673
00:36:44,723 --> 00:36:47,696
I will not tolerate
defeat any longer.

674
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:48,925
Nor will I.

675
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:53,638
All those escape pods...

676
00:36:53,677 --> 00:36:58,085
so small... so vulnerable.

677
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,557
I'll order their destruction
immediately.

678
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:01,822
No.

679
00:37:01,861 --> 00:37:04,128
Let them return
to the Federation.

680
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:08,632
Those pods are filled with
frightened, demoralized troops.

681
00:37:08,676 --> 00:37:12,481
Troops that will spread fear
throughout the Federation

682
00:37:12,518 --> 00:37:15,012
with tales
of what happened here today.

683
00:37:15,057 --> 00:37:18,087
The Founder is wise.

684
00:37:29,522 --> 00:37:30,751
There...

685
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,956
now, don't you feel better?

686
00:37:32,996 --> 00:37:34,761
Much.

687
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:36,668
Thank you, Anjohl.

688
00:37:36,705 --> 00:37:40,669
I'm here to serve
you any way I can.

689
00:37:45,457 --> 00:37:46,686
Get away from her.

690
00:37:46,727 --> 00:37:47,786
What?

691
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:51,078
Eminence, that man
is not Anjohl Tennan.

692
00:37:52,046 --> 00:37:53,447
What are you talking about?

693
00:37:53,483 --> 00:37:54,451
Anjohl Tennan

694
00:37:54,485 --> 00:37:56,512
died nine years ago

695
00:37:56,557 --> 00:37:58,618
in the labor camp at Batal.

696
00:37:58,661 --> 00:38:02,101
I warned you
not to trust him.

697
00:38:02,135 --> 00:38:03,729
I had a sample

698
00:38:03,772 --> 00:38:05,503
of his DNA sequenced.

699
00:38:05,543 --> 00:38:08,413
He's not even a Bajoran.

700
00:38:08,449 --> 00:38:11,046
He's a Cardassian.

701
00:38:12,759 --> 00:38:15,230
We were brought
together for a cause.

702
00:38:15,264 --> 00:38:17,565
A great cause.

703
00:38:17,603 --> 00:38:19,596
Our destinies are linked.

704
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,077
Don't listen to him.

705
00:38:22,112 --> 00:38:23,239
Look at him.

706
00:38:23,282 --> 00:38:26,083
Don't you recognize the face

707
00:38:26,121 --> 00:38:27,750
of your enemy?

708
00:38:29,562 --> 00:38:31,795
It's Gul Dukat.

709
00:38:31,867 --> 00:38:33,598
Oh, it can't be.

710
00:38:33,638 --> 00:38:36,577
He lied to you... used you.

711
00:38:36,612 --> 00:38:38,206
It's not true.

712
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,618
I don't know why
you wanted to do this...

713
00:38:40,653 --> 00:38:42,817
for what evil purpose...

714
00:38:42,858 --> 00:38:44,521
but it's not going to work.

715
00:38:44,562 --> 00:38:47,193
He doesn't understand, Adami.

716
00:38:47,234 --> 00:38:52,075
He couldn't possibly understand
the love of the Pah-wraiths.

717
00:38:52,112 --> 00:38:55,279
The love of the Pah-wraiths...

718
00:38:55,319 --> 00:38:58,417
you're trying to release them.

719
00:38:58,459 --> 00:39:00,520
That's why
you wanted the text

720
00:39:00,563 --> 00:39:02,055
of the <i>Kosst Amojan.</i>

721
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,070
Solbor, listen to me.

722
00:39:04,105 --> 00:39:07,408
All I want is to bring about
the Restoration.

723
00:39:07,446 --> 00:39:10,476
You've betrayed the Prophets.

724
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:12,820
You've betrayed us all.

725
00:39:12,924 --> 00:39:15,191
Try to understand.

726
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:18,293
The Pah-wraiths...
they are the true Gods.

727
00:39:18,337 --> 00:39:20,570
You must be stopped.

728
00:39:20,607 --> 00:39:23,705
Solbor... I beg you... no!

729
00:39:29,962 --> 00:39:31,295
It'll be all right.

730
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:32,891
Don't touch me.

731
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,636
My life is over.

732
00:39:36,677 --> 00:39:39,308
The Pah-wraiths sent you
to destroy me.

733
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:42,652
On the contrary,
they sent me to save you.

734
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,182
Lies.

735
00:39:44,227 --> 00:39:47,063
Nothing but Cardassian lies.

736
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:50,038
And to think I let you touch me.

737
00:39:53,714 --> 00:39:54,682
The book.

738
00:39:54,716 --> 00:39:56,049
I must destroy it.

739
00:40:05,473 --> 00:40:06,600
There!

740
00:40:06,643 --> 00:40:08,876
You see?

741
00:40:08,914 --> 00:40:13,948
The Pah-wraiths have judged you
and found you worthy.

742
00:40:14,025 --> 00:40:17,966
Their secrets
are now your secrets

743
00:40:18,034 --> 00:40:20,335
to do with as you please.

744
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:27,043
Take their gift and use it.

745
00:40:28,824 --> 00:40:31,387
Seize the power they're

746
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,922
offering you.

747
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,553
What about Solbor?

748
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:48,291
I'll take care of the body.

749
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,848
The <i>Defiant</i> was the finest ship
I ever commanded.

750
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:59,653
There'll never be
another one like her.

751
00:40:59,692 --> 00:41:01,286
It may take a while, Ben

752
00:41:01,329 --> 00:41:03,698
but I'll get you another ship,
I promise you that.

753
00:41:03,734 --> 00:41:06,832
I just wish I knew
how we were going to neutralize

754
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:08,742
the Breen energy dissipaters.

755
00:41:08,779 --> 00:41:11,376
We need to buy some time.

756
00:41:11,418 --> 00:41:14,585
Time may be the one thing
we don't have.

757
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:16,892
Captain, we're monitoring

758
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:19,299
a transmission
from Cardassian space.

759
00:41:19,336 --> 00:41:21,603
I think you're going
to find it interesting.

760
00:41:23,445 --> 00:41:24,971
...and so two years ago

761
00:41:25,014 --> 00:41:27,713
our government signed a treaty
with the Dominion.

762
00:41:27,754 --> 00:41:29,690
In it, the Dominion
promised to extend

763
00:41:29,725 --> 00:41:32,424
Cardassia's influence
throughout the Alpha Quadrant.

764
00:41:32,464 --> 00:41:35,027
In exchange,
we pledged ourselves

765
00:41:35,069 --> 00:41:36,971
to join the war
against the Federation

766
00:41:37,008 --> 00:41:38,307
and its allies.

767
00:41:38,343 --> 00:41:40,473
Cardassians have never
been afraid of war.

768
00:41:40,515 --> 00:41:43,818
A fact we've proven time and
again over these past two years.

769
00:41:43,856 --> 00:41:46,760
Seven million of our brave
soldiers have given their lives

770
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:49,097
to fulfill our part
of the agreement.

771
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,261
And what has the Dominion
done in return?

772
00:41:51,305 --> 00:41:52,638
Nothing.

773
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,373
We've gained no new territories.

774
00:41:54,413 --> 00:41:55,905
In fact, our influence

775
00:41:55,949 --> 00:41:57,782
throughout the Quadrant
has diminished.

776
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,981
And to make matters worse

777
00:41:59,022 --> 00:42:01,687
we are no longer masters
in our own home.

778
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:04,291
Travel anywhere in Cardassia
and what do you find?

779
00:42:04,334 --> 00:42:08,776
Jem'Hadar... Vorta...
and now Breen.

780
00:42:08,811 --> 00:42:12,080
Instead of the invaders,
we have become the invaded.

781
00:42:12,151 --> 00:42:16,593
Our allies have conquered us
without firing a single shot.

782
00:42:16,627 --> 00:42:18,894
Well, no longer.

783
00:42:18,933 --> 00:42:20,698
This morning, detachments
of the Cardassian First

784
00:42:20,737 --> 00:42:22,104
Third and Ninth Orders

785
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,577
attacked a Dominion outpost
on Rondac III.

786
00:42:24,612 --> 00:42:26,776
This assault marks
the first step

787
00:42:26,817 --> 00:42:28,218
toward the liberation
of our homeland...

788
00:42:28,253 --> 00:42:30,349
Colonel, see if you can get
confirmation on that.

789
00:42:30,391 --> 00:42:33,090
...from the true oppressors
of the Alpha Quadrant.

790
00:42:33,131 --> 00:42:35,694
I call upon Cardassians
everywhere...

791
00:42:35,736 --> 00:42:37,900
resist.

792
00:42:37,941 --> 00:42:39,843
Resist today.

793
00:42:39,879 --> 00:42:41,849
Resist tomorrow.

794
00:42:41,884 --> 00:42:45,848
Resist till the last Dominion
soldier has been driven

795
00:42:45,892 --> 00:42:47,452
from our soil.

796
00:42:53,141 --> 00:42:55,806
It's confirmed.

797
00:42:55,847 --> 00:42:59,082
Our cloning facility
on Rondac III

798
00:42:59,121 --> 00:43:00,488
has been destroyed.

799
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:06,134
I could be the last Weyoun.

800
00:43:06,204 --> 00:43:10,043
That's why he picked
that target.

801
00:43:10,078 --> 00:43:12,845
I want Damar and the rest
of these traitors

802
00:43:12,885 --> 00:43:15,949
found and eliminated.

803
00:43:15,991 --> 00:43:17,927
I'll see to it immediately.

804
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:27,176
I don't care how many
Cardassians you have to kill.

805
00:43:27,283 --> 00:43:28,843
Find Damar.

806
00:43:28,887 --> 00:43:29,912
Is that clear?

807
00:43:32,862 --> 00:43:34,456
I'm going to hold
you to that.

808
00:43:43,753 --> 00:43:45,746
Captain, our listening posts

809
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,555
have confirmed the
attack on Rondac.

810
00:43:47,594 --> 00:43:50,692
Damar may have just bought
us some precious time...

811
00:43:50,734 --> 00:43:52,932
if the Dominion doesn't
track him down too quickly.

812
00:43:52,973 --> 00:43:55,240
We need to find a way
to help him.

813
00:43:55,345 --> 00:43:58,785
Legate Damar may be the key
to saving the Alpha Quadrant.
