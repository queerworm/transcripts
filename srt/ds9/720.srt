1
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:09,593
Hey, welcome!

2
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:11,052
Well, I, for one,
never doubted

3
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:12,095
that you'd be back.

4
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,054
Neither did I.

5
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:14,222
Don't listen
to him.

6
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:15,432
He was Mr. Doom
and Gloom

7
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:16,976
the entire time
you were gone.

8
00:00:16,976 --> 00:00:18,435
Well, I must admit,
I was a bit concerned.

9
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,145
We were all
concerned.

10
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:23,148
Your well-being was a constant
source of conversation

11
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,358
and speculation.

12
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,944
You see? I told you
they'd miss us.

13
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,654
So, who won
the betting pool?

14
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,322
Morn. He managed to guess
the day you'd be back.

15
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:31,824
Only missed the time
of your arrival by two hours.

16
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:32,992
He's amazing.

17
00:00:32,992 --> 00:00:34,159
Don't know how
he does it.

18
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,160
Mr. Worf.

19
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,244
Captain.

20
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:37,663
I know what you're
going to say.

21
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,748
The answer is yes,
I did leave the station

22
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,584
without your permission, and
yes, I lost a runabout, but...

23
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:43,836
We'll evaluate

24
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:45,462
your actions later, old man.

25
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:46,881
Right now, I'd like to know
everything you learned

26
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:48,590
about
this Breen-Dominion alliance.

27
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,384
WORF:
I'm afraid

28
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,845
we have very little information
to share with you, Captain.

29
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:54,722
Weyoun and the others
were more interested

30
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,057
in asking questions
than they were answering them.

31
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,310
Why do you think Damar decided
to help you escape?

32
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,022
I'm not sure, but I can
tell you one thing.

33
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:04,398
He hates Weyoun.

34
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,233
The Cardassians
are a proud people

35
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,194
but the Dominion treats them
like second-class citizens.

36
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,362
I think
Damar is worried

37
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:11,655
that this new alliance
with the Breen

38
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,949
is going to weaken
Cardassia's status

39
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,868
with the Dominion even more

40
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:19,705
but, whatever his reasons,
we owe him our lives.

41
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:22,041
Maybe one day, you'll be able
to return the favor.

42
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:24,083
Uh, Doctor

43
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,670
I'd like a complete medical
workup on both of them.

44
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,631
Can't tell you how glad I am
to see you again.

45
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,218
Uh, both--
both... both of you.

46
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,136
(<i> on com</i> )
Kira to Sisko.

47
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,471
Go ahead.

48
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,181
We just received
a priority-one transmission

49
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,683
from Starfleet Command.

50
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:42,811
The Breen have attacked Earth.

51
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:52,315
SISKO:
I had a lot of friends
in those buildings.

52
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,359
Starfleet was able
to destroy most

53
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,944
of the Breen
attack force

54
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,530
but by then, most of
the damage had been done.

55
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,241
We must give
the enemy credit.

56
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,494
To launch an attack
on Starfleet Headquarters--

57
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,956
even my people
never attempted that.

58
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:11,919
We've learned one thing
about the Breen today, Captain.

59
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,504
They're a race of warriors.

60
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,630
That's about

61
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,216
all we know.

62
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:20,385
Our intelligence reports
are sketchy at best.

63
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:25,224
Captain, every species
has its weakness.

64
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:27,851
They're no exception.

65
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,854
Let's hope you're right.

66
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,690
But whatever the weakness is

67
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,568
we better find it soon.

68
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,076
WEYOUN:
There. Do you
see that?

69
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:46,453
The news from Earth
keeps getting better.

70
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,163
The Federation
casualty report

71
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:51,166
is being revised
upward once again.

72
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,542
(<i> electronically</i>
<i>distorted voice</i> )

73
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,169
Well put.

74
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,505
The casualties are
merely a bonus.

75
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:01,135
What matters is that we
have struck fear

76
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:04,429
into the heart of our enemy
and made them feel weak

77
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,181
and vulnerable.

78
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,767
General

79
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:12,187
please congratulate
your troops for us.

80
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,563
They've done a superb job.

81
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,940
Don't you agree, Damar?

82
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,525
Superb.

83
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,819
(<i> distorted voice</i> )

84
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,905
It's unfortunate
so few of your ships

85
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,031
survived the assault.

86
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,449
Leave it to you, Damar

87
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,534
to point out
the one cloud in the sky.

88
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,162
(<i> distorted voice</i> )

89
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:30,122
My thought exactly.

90
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,957
It is a very small price

91
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:34,126
for such
an important victory.

92
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:36,962
Now, if you'll excuse me

93
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,298
I must make my report
to the Founder.

94
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:49,224
By the way, in case Weyoun
neglected to mention it

95
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,893
the Dominion once sang
Cardassia's praises as well.

96
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,436
(<i> distorted voice</i> )

97
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,314
It's really quite simple.

98
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,899
They expected the war
to be over long ago.

99
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,902
It's not,
and for that they blame us.

100
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,989
Now, if the war
isn't ended soon

101
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,907
they'll shift
the blame to you.

102
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,784
(<i> distorted voice</i> )

103
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,912
Well, maybe so,
but win or lose...

104
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,125
I wouldn't turn my back
on Weyoun if I were you.

105
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,769
(<i> coughing</i> )

106
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,437
(<i> clanging</i> )

107
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,480
(<i> sighing</i> )

108
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,316
Kasidy,
what happened?

109
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,400
Uh, that's what I'm
trying to find out.

110
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,153
(<i> sighing</i> )

111
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,321
Ow.

112
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,364
What are you...
you doing?

113
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:46,573
You don't cook.

114
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,034
I-I know.
I was just making sure.

115
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:52,120
(<i> sighing</i> ):
Oh, my... my peppers.

116
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,123
I-I know how you like

117
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,209
roasted peppers
in your casserole.

118
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,169
Took me three months
to grow them.

119
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:02,463
Nobody touches
my peppers.

120
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,050
I'm so sorry.

121
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,097
With all the bad
news about Earth

122
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:13,141
I wanted to do
something nice for you.

123
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,476
But from now on

124
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,397
<i>you</i> wear the apron
in the family.

125
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,481
You know, that's
a good idea.

126
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,734
Glad you're not mad.

127
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:23,944
Wouldn't want anything

128
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,695
to ruin our last
few nights together.

129
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,073
Our last few nights together?

130
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,199
My cargo run.

131
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,700
I leave early
next week.

132
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,202
No, you're
not going anywhere.

133
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,412
It's too dangerous.

134
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,414
Ben, the Breen
attacked Earth.

135
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,165
That's not
exactly next door.

136
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,793
We don't know where they're
going to attack next.

137
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,129
I would feel better
if you were closer to me.

138
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,755
Well, that's sweet.

139
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,006
But I'm going anyway.

140
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,969
I can't talk you out of it?

141
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,845
Not a chance.

142
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:52,847
(<i> door chimes</i> )

143
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,225
Enter.

144
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,318
The information
you requested.

145
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,860
Excellent.

146
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,237
Sit down.

147
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,407
I'm not sure it's
wise for me to stay.

148
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,409
What if the Vorta decides
to pay you a visit?

149
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,910
And what if he does?

150
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,621
He'll see me conferring
with one of my officers.

151
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,705
There's nothing suspicious

152
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:18,999
about that.

153
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:26,214
Doesn't seem right--
all this plotting and secrecy.

154
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,924
What are we-- Romulans?

155
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,968
No, we're Cardassians

156
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:33,554
but right now, Cardassia's
an occupied territory

157
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,015
and to defeat an occupying army

158
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,641
takes careful planning
and secrecy.

159
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,977
Can we really hope
to defeat the Dominion?

160
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,646
With the Breen on their side,
they're stronger than ever.

161
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,024
But we will be fighting
to win back our homes

162
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:47,110
and our freedom, and that
will make us even stronger.

163
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,490
I remember the day
I heard the news

164
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,825
that Cardassia had
joined the Dominion.

165
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:57,954
Like everyone else,
I rejoiced.

166
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,790
We were going to be rulers
of the entire Alpha Quadrant.

167
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:06,796
Instead, we're a
conquered people...

168
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,424
servants in our own land.

169
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,426
All that will soon end.

170
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,306
Now, are you sure we can trust
these officers?

171
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,891
And the troops
under their command.

172
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:21,811
Still, it's not a
very long list, is it?

173
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,188
It will get longer.

174
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,981
With a victory or two

175
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,192
all Cardassia
will rise up with us.

176
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,445
We'll need to know
the exact location

177
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,780
of the Dominion
weapon emplacements

178
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,157
on Rondac III.

179
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,783
Leave that to me.

180
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:39,454
Now, I want you
to get a message

181
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,206
to every one
of these officers.

182
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,755
SOLBOR:
Regarding your
scheduled retreat

183
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,924
to the Calash Monastery?

184
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,467
Cancel it.

185
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,135
Very good.

186
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,470
Now, about your appearance

187
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,972
before the
Vedek Assembly?

188
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,100
Cancel that, too.

189
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,353
Cancel an appearance
before the Vedek Assembly?

190
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,105
Just do it.

191
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,565
Cancel everything.

192
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,525
As you wish.

193
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,902
May I ask what, exactly,
you<i> will</i> be doing?

194
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:14,197
You certainly may not.

195
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:18,743
But if you must know,
I'll be devoting most of my time

196
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,661
to study and meditation.

197
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,372
(<i> door opening</i> )

198
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,666
I see.

199
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,168
Solbor

200
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:30,464
I'll have my breakfast
on the balcony this morning.

201
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:33,633
Eminence, is there
anything you would like?

202
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,093
I'm not hungry.

203
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,636
Oh, but you
really should eat.

204
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,681
After all, Bajor
is only as strong as its Kai.

205
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,226
I said, I'm not hungry.

206
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,770
Do as he asks.

207
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,232
And please...
write a note to the vedeks

208
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,359
expressing my apologies

209
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,027
for having
to postpone our meeting.

210
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,405
I'll see to it immediately.

211
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,911
What a tiresome little man.

212
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,250
Sometimes I think you
forget your place, Anjohl.

213
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:12,088
Oh, forgive me
if I've offended you in any way.

214
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,342
I am but a moon

215
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,970
made warm
by the light of your sun.

216
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,889
I hope you're a better farmer
than you are a poet.

217
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,647
Something is wrong.

218
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:32,900
Tell me... what's
bothering you?

219
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:39,240
Everything-- the prayers,
the rituals, these robes.

220
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,620
I can't keep pretending I follow
the path of the Prophets.

221
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,331
You won't have to.

222
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:49,376
The Pah-wraiths
are waiting to embrace you.

223
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,877
So you keep saying.

224
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,046
But when is that
going to happen?

225
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:56,049
As soon as we release them
from the fire caves.

226
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,676
Release them?

227
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:59,844
But the Prophecies.

228
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,388
What about them?

229
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:02,639
Well, they warn

230
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,015
that the release
of the Pah-wraiths

231
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,724
will mean the end of Bajor.

232
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,769
The old Bajor, perhaps.

233
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:14,067
But from its ashes
a new Bajor will arise

234
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,611
and the Restoration will begin.

235
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,779
Who will be left to see it?

236
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,032
Those the Gods find worthy.

237
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:26,079
It will be the dawn
of paradise

238
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,833
and you, Adami,
are destined to rule it.

239
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,752
You're sure of that?

240
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,463
It is meant to be.

241
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,591
And what will become of you?

242
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:43,430
Oh, I will be at your side
for as long as you need me.

243
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,434
But first, we have
to release the Pah-wraiths.

244
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,728
But how do we do that?

245
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:53,147
The answer is in the text
of the<i> Kosst Amojan.</i>

246
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,858
Oh...

247
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,986
It is forbidden for<i> anyone</i>
to open that book.

248
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:02,865
Yes... anyone
except the Kai.

249
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:06,077
It is said
to contain great evil.

250
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:07,870
(<i> laughing</i> )

251
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,081
You have nothing to fear.

252
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,459
I'll be right there with you.

253
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,794
Did I say I was afraid?

254
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,924
(<i> laughs</i> )

255
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:30,059
Here, this palisade
in the south wall--

256
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,436
if only we could make

257
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,896
this part of the compound
less vulnerable.

258
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,148
What are you talking about?

259
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,857
The south wall
isn't the problem.

260
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,736
They came over the north wall,
by Travis's position.

261
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,904
I know where they came from,
Miles.

262
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,198
I<i> am</i> Travis, remember?

263
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,159
And I say we strengthen
the south wall, the north wall

264
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,411
and any other place that helps
us keep the enemy out.

265
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,705
Then it wouldn't be the battle
of the Alamo, would it?

266
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:51,956
I don't care.

267
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,667
I just want to win once.

268
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:54,917
Be Santa Anna.

269
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,169
He wins every time.

270
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,378
What if we put cannons

271
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,046
along the long barracks
like this?

272
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,424
Hey, hey, what do you think
you're doing?!

273
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,259
Do you know how long it took me
to build this thing?

274
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,094
I don't believe the two of you.

275
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,929
Your homeworld has been attacked

276
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,348
the Breen have joined forces
with the Dominion

277
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,267
and here you are,
calmly playing games.

278
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,978
Haven't you ever heard
of grace under pressure, Quark?

279
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,147
Shouldn't you be doing something
more productive?

280
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,316
I just spent 14 hours

281
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,860
recalibrating the station's
weapons array.

282
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,278
And I just did
a complete run-through

283
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,113
of the emergency support team
protocols.

284
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,908
So... you do expect
an attack on the station.

285
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,285
Anything's possible.

286
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,162
What about a moat?

287
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,665
A moat?
Around the Alamo?

288
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:34,666
Yes. Here, look.

289
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,875
We could widen this stream

290
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,251
maybe make it
a little deeper.

291
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,420
I say we build a moat
around the station.

292
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,680
He is a child.

293
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,350
Miles does have a certain...
cherubic quality.

294
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,518
I was talking

295
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,520
about Dr. Bashir,
and you know it.

296
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,360
Are you certain he's the one?

297
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,737
(<i> sighing</i> )

298
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,905
I'm not certain about anything.

299
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,949
But he is handsome.

300
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,870
WORF:
You deserve more than handsome.

301
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,497
He gets excited
playing with toys.

302
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,791
He knows
how to have a good time.

303
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,085
Besides, it's not exactly a toy.

304
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,755
You heard the Chief.
He spent hours making that.

305
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,552
I see it is hopeless
to try to reason with you.

306
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:28,636
(<i> sighing</i> )

307
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,680
I know.

308
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,140
Maybe I am in love with him.

309
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,476
Do you think I should tell him
how I feel?

310
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,897
If it will make you happy, yes.

311
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,109
You're a good friend, Worf.

312
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,944
I know.

313
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,826
They are wasting their time.

314
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,912
No matter how much planning
they do

315
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:55,996
there is no way that they
can defend that mission

316
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,124
against an enemy that numbers
in the thousands

317
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,834
not without more men.

318
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,378
You know, if you want to go
down there and help them...

319
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,758
Just a thought.

320
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:22,732
Damar.

321
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,484
You're up early.

322
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,736
Am I?

323
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,028
Yes, you are

324
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,989
or you haven't
been to bed yet.

325
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,243
Actually,
I had a very restful sleep.

326
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,453
Did you?

327
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,415
How nice.

328
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,334
I had no idea
the Breen could mobilize

329
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,210
such a large fleet
so quickly.

330
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,087
WEYOUN:
Our new allies
are full of surprises

331
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,130
aren't they?

332
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,465
Hmm.

333
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,550
You know those
refrigeration
suits they wear?

334
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,010
What about them?

335
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,929
I'm sure you've read
the intelligence reports

336
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:55,389
that say that their homeworld
is a frozen wasteland.

337
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,141
Well, it's not.

338
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:01,020
The climate on their home
planet is<i> quite</i> comfortable.

339
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,897
Then why do they wear
refrigeration suits?

340
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:03,982
They won't say.

341
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,024
You see what I mean?

342
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,901
They're full of surprises.

343
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,366
There's something...

344
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,827
different about you
today, Damar.

345
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,620
I can't quite put
my finger on it.

346
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,747
It's almost as if
you're only...

347
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,541
half-dressed.

348
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,334
What are you talking about?

349
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:26,462
You don't have a
bottle in your hand.

350
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,007
Don't you have anything
better to do than to...?

351
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:31,300
You've regained your confidence.

352
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,345
I wasn't aware that I'd lost it.

353
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,055
Come now, Damar.

354
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,058
You thought you backed
the wrong side.

355
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,395
You thought the Dominion
was going to lose this war

356
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,647
and drag Cardassia
down with it.

357
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:48,902
I must admit,
things were looking rather grim.

358
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:51,111
Perhaps, for a moment or two.

359
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,489
That's no excuse
to lose faith in oneself

360
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,282
or one's allies.

361
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,744
But now...

362
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:01,956
it's as if you've groped
your way through a dark tunnel

363
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:05,209
and stepped back out
into the light once again.

364
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,294
You know what
that light's told you?

365
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:10,339
That the Dominion
will prevail...

366
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,926
that the Federation

367
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,176
will be conquered

368
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,136
and a new era of
peace and prosperity

369
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,598
will blanket the
Alpha Quadrant.

370
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,059
You know me so well.

371
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,728
Really, Damar...

372
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,063
I hope you won't let

373
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,481
that Cardassian-
sized ego of yours

374
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,900
spoil our victory--

375
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,860
and I do mean<i> our</i> victory.

376
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,319
Yours, mine...

377
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,279
And the Breen.

378
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,781
Yes, and the Breen.

379
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,366
We're just one big,
happy family, aren't we?

380
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,704
I like it so much
better when we agree.

381
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,456
Don't you?

382
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,634
The text

383
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,929
of the<i> Kosst Amojan,</i>
as you requested.

384
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,973
Very good.

385
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,018
Well...

386
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,728
put it on my desk.

387
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,439
Eminence, may I speak frankly?

388
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,024
(<i> sighing</i> ):
If you must.

389
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:13,235
This book has not been removed
from the Archives

390
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,322
not for 700 years.

391
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,449
Your point being?

392
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,202
The knowledge it contains...

393
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,872
about the Pah-wraiths--

394
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:29,085
it is said to be
very dangerous.

395
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,878
Knowledge is
never dangerous

396
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,755
in the right hands.

397
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,298
There is an old saying--

398
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,426
he who studies evil...

399
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,763
is studied by evil.

400
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:43,432
I will keep that in mind.

401
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,435
Now give me the book.

402
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:53,776
Your concern for her Eminence
is appreciated

403
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,945
and acknowledged.

404
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:59,073
Nevertheless, you
must do as she says.

405
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:02,451
I will see to it that
no harm comes to her.

406
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,871
There. That should make you
feel better.

407
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:08,916
I wish it could,
but this man...

408
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,251
one day he comes
onto Deep Space 9

409
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,419
and the next

410
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,756
he's become
your closest advisor.

411
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,342
What do we know of him?

412
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,054
Where did he come from?

413
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,014
What does he want?

414
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:26,684
I<i> want</i> only to serve the Kai.

415
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:29,770
This is his idea, isn't it?

416
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,148
To study this hateful book.

417
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:35,776
Anjohl was sent to me
by the Prophets.

418
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,653
That's all I need to know

419
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,614
and that's all<i> anyone</i> 
needs to know.

420
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,283
I have no idea why I was chosen

421
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:48,581
but who are we to question
the ways of the Prophets?

422
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,750
Perhaps you should go
to the temple

423
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,793
and ask
the Prophets' forgiveness

424
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,879
for questioning their wisdom.

425
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:08,434
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

426
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,394
(<i> sighing</i> )

427
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,106
Solbor does not approve of me.

428
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:17,026
He has served me
well for many years.

429
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,987
And he may serve you well
for many more

430
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,864
if the Pah-wraiths
find him worthy.

431
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,577
Well...?

432
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,495
Aren't you going to open it?

433
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:39,715
The Pah-wraiths are not evil

434
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,093
but they are powerful

435
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:45,805
and they're willing to share
that power with you.

436
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:49,475
The question is:
Do you want it?

437
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,319
Yes.

438
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,557
DUKAT:
This can't be.

439
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,018
This is a trick.

440
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,439
It's not a trick.

441
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,275
Well, then Solbor brought
the wrong book.

442
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:42,195
He doesn't make those
kinds of mistakes.

443
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,325
The words are here.

444
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:49,827
They're just
hidden, that's all.

445
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:52,955
It's up to us to find them.

446
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,632
These are the new
security protocols
you requested.

447
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,009
Very good.

448
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,635
Although, frankly,
I'm not sure

449
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,804
how effective they'll
be against the Breen.

450
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,472
Neither am I.

451
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,432
I just hope we don't
have to find out.

452
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,391
(<i> door opens</i> )

453
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:14,434
KASIDY:
Benjamin?

454
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,478
You mind explaining this?

455
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:20,607
Constable, do you
mind if we use your
office for a moment?

456
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:21,942
Not at all.

457
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,158
Well, it looks like

458
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,327
the Bajoran Freight
and Shipping Authority

459
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:32,786
wants you to take
a vacation.

460
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,164
A month's<i> paid</i> vacation?

461
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:36,540
This is your doing,
isn't it?

462
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,292
Let me guess.

463
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:40,127
The Emissary asked
for a little favor.

464
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,796
I never once mentioned
the word "Emissary."

465
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,506
But you did arrange this.

466
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,550
I'm just trying to keep you
out of harm's way.

467
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,469
Is that such a terrible thing
for a husband to do?

468
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:50,846
I told you.

469
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,430
I don't need or want
that kind of protection.

470
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,432
I want you to call
whoever you called

471
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:56,269
and have them put me
back on the active list.

472
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,477
Kasidy, it's only for a month.

473
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,478
I don't care

474
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,231
if it's only for a day.

475
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:03,441
How would you like it if I
called Admiral Ross and said

476
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,361
"Oh, do me a favor.
Please don't send

477
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,529
my husband on any dangerous
missions this month"?

478
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,365
Look, that's not the same thing.

479
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,575
It is from where I'm standing.

480
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:15,788
My job is just as important
to me as your job is to you.

481
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:16,872
I know that.

482
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,339
(<i> chuckles</i> )

483
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,258
What's so funny?

484
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:32,263
Marriage-- it changes
everything.

485
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:34,640
If you're not careful

486
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,516
that could be you and Kira.

487
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,893
Huh.

488
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,412
(<i> door opens</i> )

489
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,124
Here are the other volumes

490
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:01,292
you wanted.

491
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,418
Thank you, Solbor.

492
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:03,585
You may go now.

493
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:05,587
Eminence

494
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:06,839
I must inform you

495
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,299
that the archivists
are very...

496
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,259
You heard the Kai.

497
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,218
Leave us.

498
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,803
They're wondering

499
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:18,267
why you need to consult
so many of these dark texts.

500
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:22,313
You may tell them that their Kai
works for the good of Bajor.

501
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:23,563
Now leave me.

502
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,316
I have work to do.

503
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,577
Why are you still here?

504
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,163
What would you like me to do?

505
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:41,123
Go away.

506
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,000
I don't understand.

507
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,044
I must concentrate.

508
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,128
But, Your Eminence...

509
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:48,381
Not another word.

510
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:50,883
Very well.

511
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,897
They're beautiful.

512
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,773
Then you forgive me?

513
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,526
Uh, that depends.

514
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:11,404
Have you talked to Bajoran
Freight and Shipping?

515
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:12,738
You're back on the active list.

516
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,948
Then I forgive you.

517
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,367
But, from here on in...

518
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:17,617
I'm not to interfere
with your work

519
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:20,287
unless you tell me to.

520
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:23,207
Or it's absolutely
necessary.

521
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:24,666
I'm just joking.

522
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,377
You'd better be.

523
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,299
What's that for?

524
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,842
The flowers.

525
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:38,722
And for being big enough
to admit when you're wrong.

526
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,015
(<i> door chimes</i> )

527
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,976
Ah, that must be Quark
with the necklace.

528
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,395
The necklace?

529
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:46,730
Just in case
the flowers didn't work.

530
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,482
(<i> laughing</i> )

531
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,569
Ben, the Breen have launched

532
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:53,446
a counteroffensive
against our forces

533
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:54,738
in the Chin'toka system.

534
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,989
SISKO:
Have they broken through?

535
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,699
In two places.

536
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,331
When do I leave?

537
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:16,469
This is bad... very bad.

538
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:19,805
You say that every time we take
the<i> Defiant</i> into battle.

539
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:22,141
Impulse manifold
purged and clear.

540
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,976
If we lose the
Chin'toka system

541
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:27,062
we lose our only foothold
in the Dominion territory.

542
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,022
I think that
qualifies as bad.

543
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,399
Well, we haven't lost it yet.

544
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,901
Initiating impulse
pre-start sequence.

545
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,028
Microfusion
generators on line.

546
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,948
But the Breen, they
seem unstoppable.

547
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:39,908
First Earth,
now Chin'toka?

548
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,911
Ensign, no one
is unstoppable.

549
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,497
Collimate
the nadion emitters.

550
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:46,999
Collimation sequence
in progress.

551
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,335
What more can I say, Miles,
but I'm sorry?

552
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:52,296
Dilithium matrix
is aligned and calibrated.

553
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:53,964
Just be a bit
more careful.

554
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,424
That's all I ask.

555
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,926
Opening antimatter
injector ports.

556
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,761
Trouble in paradise?

557
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,221
It was nothing.

558
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,473
Emergency life-support
and damage control systems

559
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:03,474
standing by.

560
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:05,184
I wouldn't call it nothing.

561
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,436
Autonomous guidance system
initialized and active.

562
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,646
He lost Travis.

563
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:10,272
Hmm. Sounds serious.

564
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,316
Verify astrometric
database.

565
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,776
BASHIR:
Miles built this Alamo model

566
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,362
replete with small figures.

567
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:18,113
Quite spectacular, actually.

568
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,240
Datasets loaded and verified.

569
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,826
Anyway, he was showing it to me
in Quark's when we--

570
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:25,996
rather, I-- accidentally
misplaced Colonel Travis.

571
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,914
Phaser safeties engaged.

572
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,416
Can't you make another one?

573
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,293
What, so he can
lose it again?

574
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,587
Field stabilizers
on line.

575
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:36,465
Well, that's what happens
when you share your toys.

576
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,757
Synchronizing

577
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:38,717
warp plasma flow.

578
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:39,926
It's not a toy.

579
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,679
It's a model built to scale.

580
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,847
BASHIR:
He really did
a fantastic job.

581
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,183
O'BRIEN:
Nacelles holding
at pre-warp threshold.

582
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,434
BASHIR:
Miles, look...

583
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,102
He plays with toys.

584
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,604
It's a model.

585
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:51,980
With little figures.

586
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,609
Captain on the Bridge!

587
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,319
Commander.

588
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:58,737
WORF:
Weapons array is on line.

589
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,406
Phasers are fully charged.

590
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:03,367
Quantum torpedo launchers
are loaded and standing by.

591
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:06,078
Colonel, set a course
to rendezvous

592
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,080
with the Federation
Assault Fleet.

593
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,749
Course set.

594
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,418
Take us out.

595
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:14,461
Airlocks are sealed.

596
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,256
Releasing docking clamps.

597
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,000
Where are you going
with those?

598
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,336
I'm returning these
books to the Archives.

599
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,337
On whose authority?

600
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,714
I believe

601
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,799
her Eminence has finished.

602
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,050
Put them back.

603
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,094
How dare you use
that tone with me...

604
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:05,220
(<i> groans</i> )

605
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,943
<i>I'll</i> put them back.

606
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,346
(<i> whispering</i> ):
Wake up, my love.

607
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,973
There's work to be done.

608
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,850
Oh, Anjohl.

609
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,311
I must have dozed off.

610
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,729
You're tired.

611
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,606
It's understandable.

612
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:02,736
I haven't made
much progress.

613
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:05,197
You'll find the answers
we're looking for.

614
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,782
It's just a matter of time.

615
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:09,743
Oh, I'm so glad
you're here.

616
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:11,411
Hmm.

617
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:14,414
I'll see that you're
brought something to eat.

618
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,791
Hmm?

619
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:29,221
According to the latest
battle reports

620
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,014
it looks as if the Dominion
is going to retake

621
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,558
Chin'toka.

622
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,602
A few months ago,
the thought of the Federation

623
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,062
being driven
from Cardassian soil

624
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,938
would've been a cause
for celebration

625
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:42,234
but the Dominion victories
are no longer our victories.

626
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,365
Now, are our troops
in position?

627
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:50,992
They're awaiting your command.

628
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:51,951
Excellent.

629
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,662
We attack in seven hours.

630
00:31:56,289 --> 00:32:00,043
We're going to lose
many fine soldiers.

631
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,255
At least they'll be dying
for Cardassia

632
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,465
and not the Dominion.

633
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,809
WEYOUN:
The Federation
reinforcements

634
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:17,603
are approaching
Chin'toka.

635
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,855
The more of them,
the better.

636
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:23,066
Founder,
it concerns me

637
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,902
to have you this
close to the front.

638
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:28,238
You're concern is noted.

639
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:32,158
But this is one battle
I intend to see firsthand.

640
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,619
Yes.

641
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:36,121
It should be
most gratifying.

642
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,962
ROMULAN (<i> on com</i> ): 
Romulan attack wings
three and nine

643
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,005
have reached the line
of deployment.

644
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:47,883
FEDERATION OFFICER:
Federation fighter squadrons

645
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,760
seven and ten,
break into sections

646
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,762
and stand by to begin
reconnaissance sweep.

647
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,808
MARTOK:
Lead units
assume attack positions.

648
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,392
Advance to contact.

649
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,132
Sir, they've locked weapons
on us.

650
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,384
All auxiliary power
to forward shields.

651
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:34,179
Colonel, attack pattern delta.

652
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:35,180
Aye, sir.

653
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,974
Mr. Worf, quantum torpedoes.

654
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:38,266
Target locked.

655
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,561
Fire.

656
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,533
WORF:
Target locked.

657
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,451
Launchers one
and two standing by.

658
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,577
Fire.

659
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,047
(<i> alarm beeping</i> )

660
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:20,517
What the hell is...?!

661
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:25,689
(<i> yelling</i> )

662
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,817
(<i> alarm beeping</i> )

663
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,151
We've lost power to the helm.

664
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,486
The com's out.

665
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,696
So are weapons.

666
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:34,447
Primary computer systems
are off-line.

667
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:36,783
(<i> yelling</i> )

668
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,702
Manual controls are frozen.

669
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,537
Chief.

670
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:41,663
I can't get
anything

671
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,081
back on line.

672
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,000
Somehow, they're draining
all our power.

673
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:54,092
NOG:
The fire-suppression system's
off-line!

674
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,427
WORF:
Use the manual extinguishers.

675
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,887
NOG:
I'm on it.

676
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:59,180
EZRI:
We're venting
plasma coolant

677
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,516
from over eight
separate EPS ruptures.

678
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,226
The air's becoming toxic,
Captain.

679
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,978
Sir, the ablative armor
is starting to buckle.

680
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,063
We have hull breaches

681
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:07,731
on decks 3 and 4.

682
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:09,190
O'BRIEN:
Without power for the
emergency force fields

683
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,358
there's no way to seal them.

684
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,319
Abandon ship.

685
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,155
(<i> alarm blares</i> )

686
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,616
SISKO:
You heard me.

687
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:21,078
Everyone get to the escape pods.
<i>Now.</i>

688
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,170
(<i> alarm continues</i> )

689
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,593
Captain...

690
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,973
She's a fine ship.

691
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:42,223
No one will argue
with that.

692
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,225
But like you say,
it's time to go.

693
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,714
Poor Captain Sisko.

694
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:18,176
I believe he was quite fond
of that ship.

695
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,682
Founder, I'm happy to report

696
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:26,852
that the Chin'toka system
is ours once again.

697
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:30,063
A step in the right direction.

698
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:32,691
Send my compliments
to the Breen.

699
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,985
I'm certain
that will please them greatly.

700
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:36,987
Really?

701
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:40,157
I have no idea what would please
the Breen, nor do I care

702
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:42,993
as long as they fight and win.

703
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:45,871
I will not tolerate
defeat any longer.

704
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:47,164
Nor will I.

705
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,626
All those escape pods...

706
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:56,131
so small... so vulnerable.

707
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:58,508
I'll order their destruction
immediately.

708
00:36:58,508 --> 00:36:59,968
No.

709
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:02,428
Let them return
to the Federation.

710
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:06,725
Those pods are filled with
frightened, demoralized troops.

711
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:10,729
Troops that will spread fear
throughout the Federation

712
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:13,148
with tales
of what happened here today.

713
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:16,068
The Founder is wise.

714
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,955
There...

715
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,083
now, don't you
feel better?

716
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,876
Much.

717
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:34,878
Thank you, Anjohl.

718
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:39,298
I'm here to serve
you any way I can.

719
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,553
(<i> door opens</i> )

720
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:44,554
Get away from her.

721
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,056
DUKAT:
What?

722
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:49,684
Eminence, that man
is not Anjohl Tennan.

723
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:52,270
What are you talking about?

724
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,230
Anjohl Tennan

725
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,314
died nine years ago

726
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,400
in the labor camp
at Batal.

727
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,904
I warned you
not to trust him.

728
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:02,488
I had a sample

729
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,241
of his DNA sequenced.

730
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:07,160
He's not even a Bajoran.

731
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,662
He's a Cardassian.

732
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:14,000
We were brought
together for a cause.

733
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,253
A great cause.

734
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:18,337
Our destinies
are linked.

735
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,799
SOLBOR:
Don't listen to him.

736
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:21,967
Look at him.

737
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,844
Don't you recognize the face

738
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,512
of your enemy?

739
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:30,600
It's Gul Dukat.

740
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,351
Oh, it can't be.

741
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:35,272
He lied to you...
used you.

742
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:37,107
It's not true.

743
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:39,358
I don't know why
you wanted to do this--

744
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,527
for what evil purpose--

745
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,196
but it's not going to work.

746
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:45,824
He doesn't understand, Adami.

747
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:50,787
He couldn't possibly
understand the love
of the Pah-wraiths.

748
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:53,748
The love of the Pah-wraiths...

749
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:57,085
you're trying to release them.

750
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,212
That's why
you wanted the text

751
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:00,755
of the<i> Kosst Amojan.</i>

752
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,882
Solbor, listen to me.

753
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:06,094
All I want is to bring about
the Restoration.

754
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:09,139
You've betrayed the Prophets.

755
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:11,557
You've betrayed us all.

756
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:14,019
Try to understand.

757
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,938
The Pah-wraiths--
they<i> are</i> the true Gods.

758
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:19,232
You must be stopped.

759
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:22,360
Solbor... I beg you... no!

760
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,946
(<i> yells</i> )

761
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:29,951
It'll be all right.

762
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:31,577
Don't touch me.

763
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,248
My life is over.

764
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:37,917
The Pah-wraiths sent you
to destroy me.

765
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:41,296
On the contrary,
they sent me to save you.

766
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:42,630
Lies.

767
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,925
Nothing but Cardassian lies.

768
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,511
And to think I let you touch me.

769
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:53,350
The book.

770
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,726
I must destroy it.

771
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:05,237
There!

772
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:07,488
You see?

773
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:12,577
The Pah-wraiths have judged you
and found you worthy.

774
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:16,622
Their secrets
are now your secrets

775
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,958
to do with as you please.

776
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:25,464
Take their gift and use it.

777
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,011
Seize the power they're

778
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:31,346
offering you.

779
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,148
What about Solbor?

780
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:47,279
I'll take care
of the body.

781
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,121
The<i> Defiant</i> was the finest ship
I ever commanded.

782
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:58,039
There'll never be
another one like her.

783
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,707
It may take a while, Ben

784
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:02,168
but I'll get you another ship,
I promise you that.

785
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:05,171
I just wish I knew
how we were going to neutralize

786
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,965
the Breen energy dissipaters.

787
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:09,842
We need to buy
some time.

788
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:12,762
Time may be the one thing
we don't have.

789
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:15,098
KIRA:
Captain, we're monitoring

790
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:17,725
a transmission
from Cardassian space.

791
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,936
I think you're going
to find it interesting.

792
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,440
...and so two years ago

793
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,192
our government signed a treaty
with the Dominion.

794
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,111
In it, the Dominion
promised to extend

795
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:31,072
Cardassia's influence
throughout the Alpha Quadrant.

796
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:33,532
In exchange,
we pledged ourselves

797
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,534
to join the war
against the Federation

798
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:36,953
and its allies.

799
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:39,122
Cardassians have never
been afraid of war.

800
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:42,500
A fact we've proven time and
again over these past two years.

801
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,211
Seven million of our brave
soldiers have given their lives

802
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,630
to fulfill our part
of the agreement.

803
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,632
And what has the Dominion
done in return?

804
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,134
Nothing.

805
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:52,677
We've gained no new territories.

806
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,429
In fact, our influence

807
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,306
throughout the Quadrant
has diminished.

808
00:41:56,306 --> 00:41:57,598
And to make matters worse

809
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,310
we are no longer masters
in our own home.

810
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,854
Travel anywhere in Cardassia
and what do you find?

811
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:07,484
Jem'Hadar... Vorta...
and now Breen.

812
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:10,528
Instead of the invaders,
we have become the invaded.

813
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:15,116
Our allies have conquered us
without firing a single shot.

814
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:17,327
Well, no longer.

815
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:19,162
This morning, detachments
of the Cardassian First

816
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:20,538
Third and Ninth Orders

817
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,957
attacked a Dominion outpost
on Rondac III.

818
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,917
This assault marks
the first step

819
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,585
toward the liberation
of our homeland...

820
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,921
Colonel, see if you can get
confirmation on that.

821
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,508
...from the true oppressors
of the Alpha Quadrant.

822
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:34,219
I call upon Cardassians
everywhere...

823
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,346
resist.

824
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:38,348
Resist today.

825
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:40,475
Resist tomorrow.

826
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:44,312
Resist till the last Dominion
soldier has been driven

827
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:45,771
from our soil.

828
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:54,155
It's confirmed.

829
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:57,534
Our cloning facility
on Rondac III

830
00:42:57,534 --> 00:42:59,369
has been destroyed.

831
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,416
I could be the last Weyoun.

832
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:08,461
That's why he picked
that target.

833
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:11,256
I want Damar and the rest
of these traitors

834
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:14,342
found and eliminated.

835
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:16,177
I'll see to it immediately.

836
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,478
I don't care how
many Cardassians
you have to kill.

837
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:27,063
Find Damar.

838
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:28,147
Is that clear?

839
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,109
(<i> distorted voice</i> )

840
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:32,651
I'm going to hold
you to that.

841
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:34,487
(<i> distorted voice</i> )

842
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:44,038
Captain, our listening posts

843
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,082
have confirmed the
attack on Rondac.

844
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:49,127
Damar may have just bought
us some precious time...

845
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:51,212
if the Dominion doesn't
track him down too quickly.

846
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:53,590
We need to find a way
to help him.

847
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:57,552
Legate Damar may be the key
to saving the Alpha Quadrant.
