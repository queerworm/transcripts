1
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:09,305
Computer. Time.

2
00:00:09,347 --> 00:00:11,580
1821 hours.

3
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:24,845
Can I help you?

4
00:00:24,885 --> 00:00:26,047
I think so.

5
00:00:26,087 --> 00:00:27,077
What are you doing?

6
00:00:31,767 --> 00:00:32,861
Where is it?

7
00:00:32,904 --> 00:00:34,066
Where is what?

8
00:00:34,107 --> 00:00:36,203
I don't even know
what you're looking for.

9
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:37,475
Yes, you do.

10
00:00:37,514 --> 00:00:38,504
Well?

11
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:39,713
It's not here.

12
00:00:39,754 --> 00:00:41,155
That's not good.

13
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:43,458
Is it possible we
have the wrong man?

14
00:00:43,496 --> 00:00:45,159
It's starting to look that way.

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,137
This is very embarrassing.

16
00:00:49,577 --> 00:00:50,876
Now, listen to me.

17
00:00:50,913 --> 00:00:52,041
We know why you're here

18
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:53,245
we know who you came to meet

19
00:00:53,285 --> 00:00:55,188
and we know what you
are going to give her.

20
00:00:55,224 --> 00:00:57,822
So for the last time,
where is it?

21
00:00:57,864 --> 00:00:59,664
All right...

22
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:01,261
I'll take you to it.

23
00:01:01,305 --> 00:01:03,139
You see?
It was him all along.

24
00:01:09,124 --> 00:01:11,595
I thought it was on stun.

25
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,598
Huh.

26
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:13,601
Hmm.

27
00:01:13,635 --> 00:01:16,199
Look what you did
to the carpet.

28
00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:17,437
What do we do now?

29
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,448
We don't have time
to search the whole station.

30
00:01:19,482 --> 00:01:20,678
We wait for the woman.

31
00:01:20,718 --> 00:01:23,748
She might know
where he hid it.

32
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:27,796
You wanted to see us?

33
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:31,308
Is that the new
holosuite program?

34
00:01:31,377 --> 00:01:32,402
<i>Queen's Gambit.</i>

35
00:01:32,446 --> 00:01:34,417
It came this morning.

36
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:36,547
Finally... that friend of yours

37
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,059
promised to send it
two months ago.

38
00:01:38,093 --> 00:01:39,824
According to Felix,
it's worth the wait.

39
00:01:39,865 --> 00:01:42,336
He said it's the most elaborate
program he's ever designed.

40
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:43,838
What parts do we get to play?

41
00:01:43,874 --> 00:01:45,537
Well, you get to play
Lady Wantsomore

42
00:01:45,578 --> 00:01:47,481
a beautiful socialite
who's brainwashed

43
00:01:47,516 --> 00:01:49,008
to assassinate
the Queen of England.

44
00:01:49,052 --> 00:01:51,046
Ooh... somebody stop me.

45
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:52,355
What about me?

46
00:01:52,461 --> 00:01:53,794
Odo plays Nigel Dunlap

47
00:01:53,831 --> 00:01:55,859
a former agent
who comes out of retirement

48
00:01:55,903 --> 00:01:57,634
to help me foil
this diabolical plot.

49
00:01:57,674 --> 00:01:58,699
Perfect.

50
00:01:58,743 --> 00:01:59,802
And I play...

51
00:01:59,846 --> 00:02:02,079
Julian, we know who you play.

52
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:03,246
What about me?

53
00:02:03,287 --> 00:02:05,315
Well, you're Falcon, of course.

54
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,328
Falcon? Again?

55
00:02:07,397 --> 00:02:10,302
I'm tired of being the bad guy.

56
00:02:10,337 --> 00:02:12,171
But you do it so well.

57
00:02:13,445 --> 00:02:16,179
So... is everybody all right
for Saturday?

58
00:02:16,217 --> 00:02:17,481
Fine.

59
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:18,888
No problem.

60
00:02:18,924 --> 00:02:20,621
Odo?

61
00:02:20,662 --> 00:02:24,535
Uh... what, what do you
want me to do again?

62
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:25,870
Save the Queen.

63
00:02:25,908 --> 00:02:27,070
Not only that

64
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:29,605
you get to drive around
in fancy automobiles

65
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,518
and go to posh parties.

66
00:02:31,555 --> 00:02:32,580
Ah...

67
00:02:32,624 --> 00:02:34,618
And steal her away from Falcon.

68
00:02:34,662 --> 00:02:36,690
He steals my girl?

69
00:02:36,734 --> 00:02:37,930
Um...

70
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:41,000
maybe you'd better get
another Nigel Dunlap.

71
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:42,172
Are you kidding?

72
00:02:42,214 --> 00:02:43,308
Look at her.

73
00:02:45,488 --> 00:02:47,652
I'm... I'm busy on Saturday.

74
00:02:47,693 --> 00:02:49,721
We'll do it
when you're not busy.

75
00:02:49,765 --> 00:02:51,132
I don't think so.

76
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,106
I'm sorry.

77
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,769
I... never
should have agreed

78
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,370
to be part of this
in the first place.

79
00:02:56,415 --> 00:02:58,283
Sorry.

80
00:02:59,422 --> 00:03:00,789
Well, it looks like
we'll have to find

81
00:03:00,825 --> 00:03:02,192
someone else to play Odo's part.

82
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:06,294
I'll do it.

83
00:03:12,186 --> 00:03:14,123
I've already told you...

84
00:03:14,156 --> 00:03:16,856
I don't want to play dabo,
I don't want a holosuite

85
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,299
and I don't want
anything to eat.

86
00:03:19,336 --> 00:03:20,703
Can I interest you

87
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,577
in my collection
of Risean tapestries?

88
00:03:23,613 --> 00:03:25,641
Why don't you leave her alone,
Quark?

89
00:03:25,685 --> 00:03:27,450
Can't you see
she's not interested?

90
00:03:27,555 --> 00:03:29,856
How do I know
she's not interested...

91
00:03:29,894 --> 00:03:31,762
unless I ask?

92
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:34,431
Maybe you should spend
less time

93
00:03:34,472 --> 00:03:35,998
bothering your customers

94
00:03:36,042 --> 00:03:38,708
and more time keeping an eye
on your business?

95
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:40,879
Don't worry.

96
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:44,362
I can keep my eyes on more
than one thing at a time.

97
00:03:44,396 --> 00:03:45,490
Really?

98
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:47,329
What about him?

99
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,776
He's got a graviton emitter
hidden in his ring.

100
00:03:50,812 --> 00:03:53,910
He's manipulating the table
for his friend over there.

101
00:03:53,952 --> 00:03:55,251
- Dabo!
- Dabo!

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,028
You're very observant.

103
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:04,236
Thanks.

104
00:04:05,914 --> 00:04:08,385
Are you waiting for someone?

105
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:12,020
You.

106
00:04:12,062 --> 00:04:14,226
Where have you been all my life?

107
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:15,463
Pardon me?

108
00:04:15,503 --> 00:04:17,440
Isn't that what you
were hoping I'd say?

109
00:04:17,475 --> 00:04:20,642
No, it's just that you
keep glancing at the door.

110
00:04:20,682 --> 00:04:22,949
I'm waiting for someone.

111
00:04:24,224 --> 00:04:25,784
That's all I meant.

112
00:04:26,797 --> 00:04:28,323
Sorry.

113
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:31,604
I thought you had other things
on your mind.

114
00:04:32,845 --> 00:04:36,149
Must be those bedroom eyes
of yours.

115
00:04:36,186 --> 00:04:38,248
Bedroom eyes?

116
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:41,356
You probably get that
all the time.

117
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:43,632
Not really.

118
00:04:45,575 --> 00:04:49,175
If anyone bothers you again...

119
00:04:49,217 --> 00:04:50,584
let me know.

120
00:04:50,654 --> 00:04:51,782
I'm Security Chief Odo.

121
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,820
My office is
just across the Promenade.

122
00:04:56,368 --> 00:04:58,065
I'll be all right.

123
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:00,769
Well...

124
00:05:00,813 --> 00:05:02,305
I have to go...

125
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,391
to work...

126
00:05:06,425 --> 00:05:07,985
in my office.

127
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,556
Across the Promenade.

128
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,092
Exactly.

129
00:07:21,753 --> 00:07:22,949
Look at this.

130
00:07:22,989 --> 00:07:25,256
I was checking the contents
of one of those crates.

131
00:07:25,295 --> 00:07:27,232
A tentacle grabbed my hand.

132
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:28,291
<i>Gagh.</i>

133
00:07:28,335 --> 00:07:30,066
Klingons have been getting
regular shipments of it

134
00:07:30,106 --> 00:07:31,336
since the day
they were posted here.

135
00:07:31,376 --> 00:07:32,606
I can't believe
they eat that stuff.

136
00:07:32,646 --> 00:07:33,614
Hmm.

137
00:07:33,648 --> 00:07:34,616
What are you doing?

138
00:07:34,651 --> 00:07:35,676
Nothing.

139
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:36,687
What are you looking at?

140
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:37,690
Well, I'm...

141
00:07:38,928 --> 00:07:41,867
Actually, I'm...

142
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:42,869
Never mind.

143
00:07:42,903 --> 00:07:43,871
What?

144
00:07:43,906 --> 00:07:46,104
Ah... it's embarrassing.

145
00:07:46,145 --> 00:07:47,808
Would you just tell me?

146
00:07:47,848 --> 00:07:51,414
Well, last night...
a woman in Quark's

147
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,429
told me I have...
bedroom eyes.

148
00:07:54,531 --> 00:07:56,468
I'm trying to see if it's true.

149
00:07:57,572 --> 00:07:59,337
Tell me about this woman.

150
00:07:59,376 --> 00:08:03,181
She thought I was trying
to seduce her.

151
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:05,690
It was all just
a misunderstanding.

152
00:08:05,725 --> 00:08:08,196
If you say so.

153
00:08:08,231 --> 00:08:10,795
You going to see her again?

154
00:08:10,837 --> 00:08:12,397
I have no idea. Why?

155
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:14,275
Obviously,
she's very perceptive.

156
00:08:14,312 --> 00:08:16,545
Meaning what?

157
00:08:16,584 --> 00:08:18,076
Meaning...

158
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,029
you should see her again.

159
00:08:38,135 --> 00:08:40,106
Hello again.

160
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,304
What's this all about?

161
00:08:45,352 --> 00:08:47,152
You tried to break
into the station computer.

162
00:08:47,191 --> 00:08:48,717
Why?

163
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:50,321
My friend never
showed up last night.

164
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,893
I wanted to check
the passenger manifests

165
00:08:52,938 --> 00:08:54,772
to find out if he came aboard.

166
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:56,176
Why didn't you come to me?

167
00:08:56,213 --> 00:08:58,377
I could've checked
the manifests for you.

168
00:08:58,418 --> 00:09:00,787
When you grow up on Finnea Prime

169
00:09:00,823 --> 00:09:02,919
you learn
not to trust policemen.

170
00:09:06,035 --> 00:09:07,835
Dataport bothering you?

171
00:09:09,712 --> 00:09:12,480
The security protocols
protecting your computer

172
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,818
generated some nasty feedback.

173
00:09:14,857 --> 00:09:15,916
I know.

174
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,727
I designed them that way.

175
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,065
Nice job.

176
00:09:20,103 --> 00:09:21,367
I couldn't stay interfaced

177
00:09:21,406 --> 00:09:24,676
long enough to break
past the encryption lockouts.

178
00:09:24,713 --> 00:09:26,239
That was the idea.

179
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:33,532
Tell me, Arissa...

180
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:36,907
what's a nice woman like you
doing with a dataport?

181
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:38,277
They're not illegal.

182
00:09:38,314 --> 00:09:39,544
They ought to be.

183
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:42,143
People tend to use them
to access information

184
00:09:42,189 --> 00:09:44,387
other people don't want them
to access.

185
00:09:44,428 --> 00:09:46,422
I've heard that.

186
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:49,303
This Idanian you were
waiting for in Quark's...

187
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,866
Tauvid Rem...

188
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,938
what were you meeting him about?

189
00:09:52,982 --> 00:09:54,747
A personal matter.

190
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:59,586
Well, I suppose I could just
go to his quarters and ask him.

191
00:09:59,697 --> 00:10:01,531
I'd rather you didn't.

192
00:10:02,805 --> 00:10:04,776
It's a delicate situation.

193
00:10:06,614 --> 00:10:08,208
I'm listening.

194
00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:12,889
Tauvid's well-known for...

195
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:14,558
finding people...

196
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,664
people who don't necessarily
want to be found.

197
00:10:20,314 --> 00:10:22,751
He's helping me
locate my daughter.

198
00:10:22,787 --> 00:10:27,389
I gave her up
when she was born 15 years ago.

199
00:10:27,431 --> 00:10:29,664
I see.

200
00:10:29,736 --> 00:10:32,470
He told me he had information
about her.

201
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:34,069
That's all I know.

202
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:39,350
I've been looking for her
for a long time.

203
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,861
Please...

204
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:44,701
let me talk to him.

205
00:10:47,045 --> 00:10:48,207
All right.

206
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:52,383
I'll take you to him.

207
00:10:52,424 --> 00:10:54,895
We'll sort out the rest later.

208
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,126
Thank you.

209
00:11:04,686 --> 00:11:06,850
Maybe he's not in.

210
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:10,264
According to the access log,
he's inside.

211
00:11:14,444 --> 00:11:15,936
It's Security.

212
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:18,546
Hello?

213
00:11:32,753 --> 00:11:34,245
He's not here.

214
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:38,431
Oh, yes, he is...

215
00:11:38,467 --> 00:11:40,232
what's left of him.

216
00:11:48,492 --> 00:11:52,798
The residue we found
contains Idanian DNA.

217
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:55,968
I think it's safe to assume
that it came from Tauvid Rem.

218
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,274
Do you have any idea

219
00:11:57,313 --> 00:11:59,341
why someone would want
to kill him?

220
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,917
No, but considering
what he did for a living

221
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,691
he probably had dealings

222
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,894
with all sorts
of marginal characters.

223
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:09,440
Maybe it was a robbery.

224
00:12:09,475 --> 00:12:11,275
What makes you say that?

225
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:14,776
I didn't see any personal
belongings in his quarters.

226
00:12:14,854 --> 00:12:17,348
Did your deputies find anything?

227
00:12:17,394 --> 00:12:18,920
No.

228
00:12:20,335 --> 00:12:22,135
Well, whatever happened

229
00:12:22,173 --> 00:12:24,440
I doubt it had anything
to do with me or my daughter.

230
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:27,042
Now, that depends.

231
00:12:27,084 --> 00:12:30,490
It's possible someone doesn't
want you to find your daughter.

232
00:12:30,525 --> 00:12:32,689
Tauvid didn't give me
any indication of that

233
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:33,790
when we spoke.

234
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:35,133
When was that?

235
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,469
About three days ago.

236
00:12:38,177 --> 00:12:39,669
Oh, I can't believe this.

237
00:12:39,714 --> 00:12:41,149
I was so close to finding her

238
00:12:41,184 --> 00:12:43,212
and now I'm going to have
to start all over again.

239
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:46,691
That's if you'll let me.

240
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:47,825
If?

241
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,269
In case you'd forgotten

242
00:12:49,304 --> 00:12:52,436
I'm facing charges for trying
to break into your computer.

243
00:12:53,915 --> 00:12:56,513
Considering you weren't
able to access

244
00:12:56,555 --> 00:12:58,992
any secured information...

245
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:02,023
I've decided
to drop those charges.

246
00:13:02,068 --> 00:13:05,200
I appreciate that very much.

247
00:13:06,746 --> 00:13:08,511
You're free to go.

248
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,079
Thank you.

249
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,185
You're a very kind man.

250
00:13:13,228 --> 00:13:15,324
I hope you find your daughter.

251
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:10,880
Morn!

252
00:14:13,155 --> 00:14:15,058
We're closed.

253
00:14:16,764 --> 00:14:18,199
Go home.

254
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,772
I'm afraid the Assay Office
is closed for the evening.

255
00:14:38,516 --> 00:14:41,353
If you want to secure
any valuables

256
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:43,519
you'll have to come back
in the morning.

257
00:14:43,561 --> 00:14:45,691
Thanks.
I'll do that.

258
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:48,638
I didn't realize
I tripped an alarm.

259
00:14:48,673 --> 00:14:49,641
You didn't.

260
00:14:49,676 --> 00:14:51,202
You're good.

261
00:14:51,246 --> 00:14:53,547
I still got caught.

262
00:14:53,585 --> 00:14:55,316
I've been following you.

263
00:14:55,356 --> 00:14:56,381
I didn't know.

264
00:14:56,425 --> 00:14:57,985
I'm good, too.

265
00:15:00,134 --> 00:15:01,660
So...

266
00:15:01,705 --> 00:15:04,906
did you find anything
in Tauvid's locker?

267
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,440
Would you believe me
if I said no?

268
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:10,516
Actually, I'd have
you strip searched.

269
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:12,051
That might be fun.

270
00:15:12,096 --> 00:15:14,694
But in the interest
of saving time...

271
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:19,107
I've never seen a data crystal
quite like this.

272
00:15:19,147 --> 00:15:22,211
Looks like it has a phase
inverter embedded inside it.

273
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,452
It's not going to be easy
to decode.

274
00:15:24,492 --> 00:15:26,986
Given that all it contains
is information

275
00:15:27,032 --> 00:15:28,262
about a missing girl

276
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,036
Tauvid went to great lengths
to secure it.

277
00:15:31,075 --> 00:15:32,806
You know how Idanians are.

278
00:15:32,846 --> 00:15:34,338
They're a secretive race.

279
00:15:34,383 --> 00:15:36,513
You realize it would
be a simple matter

280
00:15:36,555 --> 00:15:38,788
for me to have you
examined by a doctor

281
00:15:38,828 --> 00:15:41,231
to determine if you've
ever been pregnant.

282
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:45,105
You keep threatening to have me
stripped down and examined.

283
00:15:45,142 --> 00:15:47,876
I'm trying not to read
too much into that.

284
00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:50,011
You don't have a daughter,
do you?

285
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,862
No.

286
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:58,305
That's probably the first true
statement I've heard you make.

287
00:15:58,341 --> 00:15:59,935
Not quite.

288
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:02,538
I meant what I said
about your eyes.

289
00:16:06,026 --> 00:16:07,620
What's on the crystal?

290
00:16:07,663 --> 00:16:10,568
I don't know,
but I need to find out.

291
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:11,593
Why?

292
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,008
Because if I don't, I'm dead.

293
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:22,791
Maybe you'd better start
at the beginning.

294
00:16:24,971 --> 00:16:27,101
I work for a man named Draim.

295
00:16:27,143 --> 00:16:28,373
Ah.

296
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:30,316
I see you've heard of him.

297
00:16:30,351 --> 00:16:32,379
He's with the Orion Syndicate.

298
00:16:32,422 --> 00:16:33,721
If I'm not mistaken

299
00:16:33,758 --> 00:16:36,697
he specializes in blackmail
and extortion.

300
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:39,762
How do you fit in
with his organization?

301
00:16:39,807 --> 00:16:44,182
I access computer systems
and steal information for him...

302
00:16:44,217 --> 00:16:48,182
government data, business
plans... whatever he asks for.

303
00:16:48,227 --> 00:16:49,662
I hope you're well paid.

304
00:16:49,697 --> 00:16:51,759
It's a very dangerous
line of work.

305
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,966
Trigger the wrong
security protocol

306
00:16:54,008 --> 00:16:56,502
you could end up
with permanent brain damage.

307
00:16:56,546 --> 00:16:59,017
I think about that
from time to time

308
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,854
but there's not much
I can do about it.

309
00:17:01,893 --> 00:17:04,126
You don't quit
the Orion Syndicate

310
00:17:04,165 --> 00:17:05,725
unless they say you can.

311
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:08,435
Do you want to quit?

312
00:17:08,475 --> 00:17:10,878
That's why I came
to meet Tauvid.

313
00:17:10,914 --> 00:17:12,110
Who was he?

314
00:17:12,151 --> 00:17:13,745
I don't know.

315
00:17:13,788 --> 00:17:16,157
Then why did you
come to meet him?

316
00:17:16,194 --> 00:17:17,891
He told me
he had information...

317
00:17:17,931 --> 00:17:20,164
information I could use
to break away

318
00:17:20,203 --> 00:17:21,934
from Draim free and clear.

319
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,411
What made you believe
that he was telling the truth?

320
00:17:24,447 --> 00:17:25,848
I don't know.

321
00:17:25,883 --> 00:17:27,375
I just did.

322
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:31,122
I'm not even sure how he knew
I wanted to get out.

323
00:17:31,163 --> 00:17:33,532
Did he tell you
what this information was?

324
00:17:33,569 --> 00:17:35,038
No.

325
00:17:35,106 --> 00:17:39,446
But for some reason,
I decided to trust him.

326
00:17:39,483 --> 00:17:42,183
Oh, I know this sounds insane.

327
00:17:42,223 --> 00:17:44,387
I guess I was desperate.

328
00:17:44,428 --> 00:17:46,831
Did you tell anyone
you were coming here?

329
00:17:46,868 --> 00:17:49,898
No, but Draim must have
monitored my communication.

330
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:52,846
How else could he have
gotten his people here

331
00:17:52,882 --> 00:17:53,976
before I arrived?

332
00:17:54,018 --> 00:17:56,684
So you think
Draim had Tauvid killed

333
00:17:56,724 --> 00:17:58,957
to stop you
from getting this crystal.

334
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:02,334
And whoever he hired is
probably still on the station.

335
00:18:02,371 --> 00:18:04,706
You can be sure that Draim
wants to know

336
00:18:04,744 --> 00:18:07,079
what's on that crystal
as much as I do.

337
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:10,386
What are you smiling about?

338
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:14,627
Oh, I'm just picturing myself
trying to explain all this

339
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:17,299
to the authorities
back on Finnea...

340
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,832
not that they'll listen.

341
00:18:18,877 --> 00:18:21,406
They'll just send me to prison.

342
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:24,754
I'm not turning this over
to the Finneans.

343
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:26,386
You're not?

344
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:28,662
I'm placing you
in protective custody

345
00:18:28,701 --> 00:18:31,538
while I have someone
try to access the crystal.

346
00:18:31,574 --> 00:18:33,100
In the meantime, I want you

347
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,206
to look at security recordings
made at the airlocks.

348
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,052
Draim was probably careful
not to send anyone

349
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,118
you'd recognize,
but you never know.

350
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:42,496
Why are you doing this?

351
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:44,093
Doing what?

352
00:18:44,138 --> 00:18:45,128
Helping me.

353
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,539
Why not?

354
00:18:46,577 --> 00:18:48,012
You mean, you're just doing this

355
00:18:48,047 --> 00:18:49,607
out of the kindness
of your heart?

356
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,123
I... don't have a heart.

357
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:56,132
You could have fooled me.

358
00:19:00,811 --> 00:19:02,782
What'd you get?

359
00:19:02,816 --> 00:19:05,812
It's called <i>hasperat.</i>

360
00:19:07,026 --> 00:19:08,393
Where is she?

361
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:15,333
She's with that changeling
Security Chief.

362
00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:17,042
Spicy.

363
00:19:17,084 --> 00:19:18,280
Mmm.

364
00:19:19,957 --> 00:19:21,688
They have the crystal.

365
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:25,169
We've got to make sure
she doesn't access it.

366
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:26,465
She's so pretty.

367
00:19:26,506 --> 00:19:30,140
I was hoping
we wouldn't have to kill her.

368
00:19:30,181 --> 00:19:32,550
You'll get over it.

369
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:38,858
Nice room.

370
00:19:38,902 --> 00:19:40,428
Don't get too used to it.

371
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:41,771
You're not staying here.

372
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:43,506
Odo to Security.

373
00:19:43,547 --> 00:19:45,210
Begin transport.

374
00:19:53,336 --> 00:19:54,566
There.

375
00:19:54,606 --> 00:19:55,734
Now, if anyone was watching

376
00:19:55,776 --> 00:19:57,974
they'll think you're still
in the other quarters.

377
00:19:58,015 --> 00:19:59,109
Hmm. Good trick.

378
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,209
Hope it works.

379
00:20:00,253 --> 00:20:02,451
Interesting furniture.

380
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:06,092
I use these things
to practice shape-shifting.

381
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:08,863
These are your quarters?

382
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,969
I thought this would
be the last place

383
00:20:11,012 --> 00:20:13,074
anyone would look for you.

384
00:20:13,117 --> 00:20:15,783
There's a bed in the other room.

385
00:20:15,824 --> 00:20:20,028
I was planning to stay out here,
so I could keep an eye on you...

386
00:20:20,068 --> 00:20:21,936
if that's all right.

387
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:24,239
I could use the company.

388
00:20:24,278 --> 00:20:26,978
I have two deputies

389
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,920
stationed outside
in the corridor

390
00:20:28,955 --> 00:20:32,156
posing as a maintenance
crew doing repairs.

391
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:34,726
And where are you
going to sleep?

392
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:37,104
I don't need a bed.

393
00:20:37,142 --> 00:20:40,947
I regenerate by reverting
to a gelatinous state.

394
00:20:40,984 --> 00:20:42,510
Mmm. Sounds relaxing.

395
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,691
It is actually.

396
00:20:47,935 --> 00:20:50,031
I'm so tired, I wouldn't mind

397
00:20:50,073 --> 00:20:52,705
being in a gelatinous
state myself.

398
00:20:52,745 --> 00:20:56,710
I understand you haven't
been able to identify anyone

399
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,022
from the security recordings.

400
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:02,161
No.

401
00:21:02,202 --> 00:21:05,334
I haven't had much luck
identifying Tauvid either.

402
00:21:05,443 --> 00:21:07,003
It's not his real name.

403
00:21:07,046 --> 00:21:09,347
He took
three different transports

404
00:21:09,453 --> 00:21:12,324
to get to the station... used
a different identity each time.

405
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,195
I've transmitted

406
00:21:13,328 --> 00:21:15,629
a picture of him
to the Idanian authorities.

407
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:17,604
I'm not sure we'll get a reply.

408
00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:20,339
As you said before,
they're a very secretive race.

409
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:21,780
What about the crystal?

410
00:21:21,815 --> 00:21:23,182
Dax and Chief O'Brien

411
00:21:23,219 --> 00:21:26,921
are still trying to get
past the encryption lockouts.

412
00:21:26,961 --> 00:21:28,726
I could try to interface
with it.

413
00:21:28,766 --> 00:21:31,237
No, that's not a good idea.

414
00:21:31,271 --> 00:21:33,606
The first time
they attempted to access it

415
00:21:33,644 --> 00:21:35,774
the feedback
shorted out the computer.

416
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:38,721
I'd hate to see what that
would do to your dataport.

417
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:41,992
Oh, I can't believe
what I got myself into...

418
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:45,231
walking out on Draim to meet
someone I don't even know.

419
00:21:45,272 --> 00:21:46,331
I must have been out of my mind.

420
00:21:46,374 --> 00:21:47,364
You said you were desperate.

421
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,606
Why do you think

422
00:21:48,647 --> 00:21:50,982
I got involved with Draim
in the first place?

423
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:54,391
I know life on Finnea isn't easy

424
00:21:54,427 --> 00:21:57,491
but you must have had
other options.

425
00:21:57,534 --> 00:21:59,265
Have you ever been there?

426
00:21:59,305 --> 00:22:01,070
No.

427
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,479
It's not like a Federation world

428
00:22:03,515 --> 00:22:06,009
where everything
is handed to you.

429
00:22:06,088 --> 00:22:08,652
You know
how I ended up with this?

430
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:12,936
I was a net-girl.

431
00:22:12,972 --> 00:22:16,310
I told myself I wasn't selling

432
00:22:16,346 --> 00:22:19,547
my body since there
was no actual contact...

433
00:22:19,587 --> 00:22:21,558
but I was.

434
00:22:21,592 --> 00:22:24,622
I let men
into my mind for money.

435
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,363
Draim was one of them.

436
00:22:26,403 --> 00:22:28,306
That's how we first met.

437
00:22:28,341 --> 00:22:31,508
Before I knew it,
I was working for him.

438
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,682
He paid me more
than I'd ever seen before.

439
00:22:37,229 --> 00:22:39,097
I was so far removed

440
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:41,696
from the consequences
of what I was doing

441
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:45,773
it was easy to pretend
that I wasn't hurting anyone.

442
00:22:45,816 --> 00:22:48,948
I'd hear things now and then.

443
00:22:48,991 --> 00:22:53,593
Some businessman Draim had me
investigate would disappear.

444
00:22:53,635 --> 00:22:57,440
I tried to convince myself
it had nothing to do with me

445
00:22:57,478 --> 00:23:00,748
but after a while,
I couldn't pretend anymore.

446
00:23:00,785 --> 00:23:02,619
I wanted out.

447
00:23:03,793 --> 00:23:07,427
I guess I'm finally going
to get my wish.

448
00:23:09,072 --> 00:23:11,806
Only problem is I'll be dead.

449
00:23:11,846 --> 00:23:14,717
Oh, I don't want to cry.

450
00:23:14,753 --> 00:23:16,986
The dead don't cry.

451
00:23:17,025 --> 00:23:19,657
Arissa...

452
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:22,227
I'm not going to let
anyone harm you.

453
00:23:24,008 --> 00:23:26,002
You have to trust me.

454
00:23:27,584 --> 00:23:29,748
I do trust you.

455
00:23:31,526 --> 00:23:34,294
But you can't
protect me forever.

456
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:37,534
Sooner or later,
Draim will get to me.

457
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:41,807
I've got to find out
what's on that crystal.

458
00:23:41,851 --> 00:23:43,719
I don't think you can
count on whatever's

459
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,589
on that crystal
to get you out of this.

460
00:23:45,627 --> 00:23:47,894
If that's true,
I don't have a chance.

461
00:23:47,932 --> 00:23:49,458
Yes, you do.

462
00:23:49,503 --> 00:23:51,166
If you testified against Draim

463
00:23:51,207 --> 00:23:54,203
you could put him in prison
for the rest of his life.

464
00:23:54,247 --> 00:23:56,845
You could get immunity
for any past crimes

465
00:23:56,887 --> 00:23:58,481
you may have committed...
start a new life.

466
00:23:58,524 --> 00:24:00,221
Testify against Draim?

467
00:24:00,329 --> 00:24:02,163
I would never make it
to the witness stand.

468
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:04,169
I will take personal
responsibility

469
00:24:04,238 --> 00:24:05,366
for your safety.

470
00:24:05,408 --> 00:24:07,311
I don't care how long it takes.

471
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:10,045
If I have to ask
for a leave of absence, I will.

472
00:24:10,085 --> 00:24:12,181
You'd do that for me?

473
00:24:13,527 --> 00:24:14,586
Why?

474
00:24:17,335 --> 00:24:21,869
I've done things in my life
I'm not proud of, too.

475
00:24:21,914 --> 00:24:24,682
You worked for Draim.

476
00:24:24,721 --> 00:24:27,717
I worked for the Cardassians.

477
00:24:27,761 --> 00:24:31,167
I never had the courage
to walk away.

478
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,934
You did.

479
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:34,465
I admire that.

480
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,877
Oh... wait a minute.

481
00:24:35,913 --> 00:24:38,442
You're going to have
to give me a minute

482
00:24:38,487 --> 00:24:39,786
to get used to this.

483
00:24:39,823 --> 00:24:42,260
I've never been admired
for anything

484
00:24:42,295 --> 00:24:43,992
other than the way I look.

485
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:46,436
Most people can't see
past the surface...

486
00:24:46,472 --> 00:24:49,309
especially when what they see
is so beautiful.

487
00:24:52,052 --> 00:24:55,288
I'm... I-I'm sorry.
I merely meant...

488
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:57,332
Don't apologize.

489
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:03,676
Well...

490
00:25:03,713 --> 00:25:05,114
I'm going to see

491
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:08,613
if they've made any progress
decoding the crystal.

492
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:10,459
Make yourself comfortable.

493
00:25:10,497 --> 00:25:12,468
I'll check in on you later.

494
00:25:12,502 --> 00:25:14,405
I'm not going anywhere.

495
00:25:27,671 --> 00:25:29,642
Let me help you with that.

496
00:25:31,413 --> 00:25:33,577
Extraordinary.

497
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:37,082
You just jumped out of
an airplane at 20,000 feet

498
00:25:37,127 --> 00:25:41,000
and yet, there's not a hair
on your head out of place.

499
00:25:47,786 --> 00:25:49,620
Odo.

500
00:25:49,657 --> 00:25:51,855
I'm sorry to interrupt.

501
00:25:51,896 --> 00:25:53,992
I need to talk to you.

502
00:25:54,035 --> 00:25:55,595
Alone.

503
00:25:57,509 --> 00:26:00,073
Um, driver, stop the car.

504
00:26:00,115 --> 00:26:02,952
Uh, we'll just be a minute.

505
00:26:11,676 --> 00:26:15,447
Uh, isn't that the woman
I was supposed to steal

506
00:26:15,486 --> 00:26:16,716
away from Falcon?

507
00:26:16,755 --> 00:26:19,284
Well, uh, yes, but since
you didn't show up...

508
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,128
You swept her off her feet.

509
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:23,467
Sort of.

510
00:26:23,505 --> 00:26:25,168
Tell me...

511
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:27,544
how did you know
she was interested?

512
00:26:27,582 --> 00:26:29,176
It's that kind of program.

513
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:31,122
What is this all about, Odo?

514
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:34,130
You didn't come here
to talk to me about women...

515
00:26:34,164 --> 00:26:35,394
Did you?

516
00:26:35,467 --> 00:26:37,404
Ah...

517
00:26:37,505 --> 00:26:40,809
This is about bedroom eyes,
isn't it?

518
00:26:40,846 --> 00:26:42,406
Who told you about her?
Kira?

519
00:26:42,483 --> 00:26:43,416
Nope.

520
00:26:43,486 --> 00:26:44,419
Dax.

521
00:26:44,488 --> 00:26:45,718
Actually, it was Miles.

522
00:26:45,758 --> 00:26:46,852
Oh...

523
00:26:46,895 --> 00:26:49,298
If people are talking,
it's only because they care.

524
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:50,802
You put on a good front

525
00:26:50,837 --> 00:26:53,172
but anyone who really knows you
can tell that you're lonely.

526
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:54,974
If you're interested
in this woman

527
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:56,108
you have to let her know.

528
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:57,117
Oh, I can't.

529
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,142
Why not?

530
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,888
What if I?

531
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,125
What if she?

532
00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:05,604
Rejects you?

533
00:27:05,639 --> 00:27:08,703
She might... but you
can't go through life

534
00:27:08,746 --> 00:27:10,944
trying to avoid
getting a broken heart.

535
00:27:10,985 --> 00:27:13,787
If you do, it'll break
from loneliness anyway.

536
00:27:13,825 --> 00:27:16,092
So you might as well
take a chance.

537
00:27:16,131 --> 00:27:17,566
If you don't, she'll move on

538
00:27:17,601 --> 00:27:20,004
and you'll never know
what you might have had

539
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,104
and living with that is worse
than having a broken heart.

540
00:27:23,148 --> 00:27:24,617
Believe me.

541
00:27:26,756 --> 00:27:27,850
We're nearly finished, darling.

542
00:27:29,831 --> 00:27:32,029
Car trouble, Mr. Bashir?

543
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:33,059
Hi, Odo.

544
00:27:34,073 --> 00:27:35,474
I-I should go.

545
00:27:35,578 --> 00:27:37,013
Thank you, Doctor.

546
00:27:37,048 --> 00:27:39,246
Odo...

547
00:27:39,287 --> 00:27:40,346
This isn't fair.

548
00:27:40,389 --> 00:27:41,983
Odo and I were talking.

549
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,257
Didn't anyone ever tell you

550
00:27:43,296 --> 00:27:45,358
you shouldn't stop
for hitchhikers?

551
00:27:53,955 --> 00:27:56,928
- Hello.
- Hello.

552
00:27:59,335 --> 00:28:02,467
I... didn't expect
to find you awake.

553
00:28:02,508 --> 00:28:04,205
I couldn't sleep.

554
00:28:04,247 --> 00:28:06,981
Uh, if the bed
is uncomfortable, I...

555
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:07,785
The bed is fine.

556
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:11,684
I guess you have no news for me?

557
00:28:11,727 --> 00:28:14,791
Chief O'Brien
is going to run a quantum scan

558
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,770
on the crystal in the morning.

559
00:28:16,806 --> 00:28:18,469
I'd like to be there.

560
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,447
I might be able to help.

561
00:28:20,481 --> 00:28:22,007
I'll arrange it.

562
00:28:23,723 --> 00:28:25,717
I'm not in your way, am I?

563
00:28:25,761 --> 00:28:27,230
No.

564
00:28:28,635 --> 00:28:30,629
No, not at all.

565
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,812
I, uh...

566
00:28:34,849 --> 00:28:37,913
I usually read
for an hour or two.

567
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:41,587
What are you reading?

568
00:28:43,336 --> 00:28:45,739
It's a detective novel.

569
00:28:45,776 --> 00:28:49,376
Oh. Have you figured out
who did it yet?

570
00:28:49,418 --> 00:28:51,355
By the third page.

571
00:28:51,389 --> 00:28:52,790
Well...

572
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,594
I should let you
get back to your book.

573
00:28:57,637 --> 00:29:00,131
I...

574
00:29:00,177 --> 00:29:02,775
don't really feel like reading.

575
00:29:05,289 --> 00:29:07,921
Perhaps we could
talk for a while.

576
00:29:10,669 --> 00:29:13,369
What do you want to talk about?

577
00:29:36,329 --> 00:29:39,029
Hmm. Tell me more.

578
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:50,896
I could swear that
when we first met...

579
00:29:50,932 --> 00:29:53,928
your nose had
a little curve right here.

580
00:29:53,972 --> 00:29:54,962
Hmm.

581
00:29:55,075 --> 00:29:59,381
Oh, I tend to look
a little different every day.

582
00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:03,759
But you always manage
to make these the same.

583
00:30:03,796 --> 00:30:07,738
Well, I pay special
attention to my scowl.

584
00:30:07,771 --> 00:30:10,573
An air of stern suspicion

585
00:30:10,612 --> 00:30:12,845
is very important
in my line of work.

586
00:30:18,497 --> 00:30:20,627
What?

587
00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:23,106
Why are you looking
at me that way?

588
00:30:25,046 --> 00:30:27,210
I'm...

589
00:30:27,252 --> 00:30:29,850
just trying to figure
something out.

590
00:30:29,891 --> 00:30:32,385
Tell me.

591
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:33,923
Maybe I can help.

592
00:30:36,942 --> 00:30:39,972
You're the first woman
I've ever been...

593
00:30:40,015 --> 00:30:41,484
close with.

594
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:46,562
I've never been able
to let down my guard.

595
00:30:48,236 --> 00:30:50,868
I was just wondering...

596
00:30:50,909 --> 00:30:53,312
what makes you different.

597
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:58,316
Wait a minute.

598
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,823
Have you never been
with anyone else before?

599
00:31:03,405 --> 00:31:05,273
Not with a humanoid.

600
00:31:06,412 --> 00:31:08,406
Well, once...

601
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,944
on my homeworld, I...

602
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,461
had an experience
you might consider...

603
00:31:15,134 --> 00:31:16,797
sexual.

604
00:31:17,806 --> 00:31:20,370
But never with a woman before.

605
00:31:21,749 --> 00:31:23,982
Could you tell?

606
00:31:24,021 --> 00:31:25,581
No.

607
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:28,724
Good.

608
00:31:47,378 --> 00:31:50,442
I don't ever want
to leave this room.

609
00:31:50,485 --> 00:31:52,888
Can we stay here forever?

610
00:31:52,923 --> 00:31:55,691
Oh, I wish we could.

611
00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:00,965
Arissa?

612
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,979
Everything...

613
00:32:04,017 --> 00:32:06,386
is going to work out.

614
00:32:06,423 --> 00:32:09,453
I want to believe that

615
00:32:09,497 --> 00:32:11,934
but I know
what the Orion Syndicate

616
00:32:11,969 --> 00:32:14,406
does to people
who turn against them.

617
00:32:14,442 --> 00:32:17,712
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life

618
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,812
looking over my shoulder.

619
00:32:24,232 --> 00:32:25,200
Oh, I'm sorry.

620
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,229
I shouldn't have brought it up.

621
00:32:29,745 --> 00:32:31,579
Let's just be together.

622
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:34,445
All right.

623
00:32:46,953 --> 00:32:50,120
Tell me more about
this encounter you had

624
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,595
on your homeworld.

625
00:32:51,631 --> 00:32:52,793
Hmm?

626
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:56,171
It was with another changeling.

627
00:32:57,913 --> 00:32:59,644
Our bodies...

628
00:32:59,684 --> 00:33:01,621
became...

629
00:33:01,655 --> 00:33:03,751
intermingled...

630
00:33:03,793 --> 00:33:06,891
Mmm. Sounds nice.

631
00:33:06,935 --> 00:33:07,925
Hmm.

632
00:33:09,507 --> 00:33:12,708
Too bad I'm not a changeling.

633
00:33:12,748 --> 00:33:15,778
Oh, we shouldn't
let that stop us.

634
00:33:33,063 --> 00:33:35,695
She spent the night
in his quarters.

635
00:33:35,737 --> 00:33:38,403
He had her
under protective custody.

636
00:33:38,443 --> 00:33:39,411
Come on, Nerys.

637
00:33:39,445 --> 00:33:41,176
He could have put
her somewhere else.

638
00:33:41,217 --> 00:33:44,418
You know how Odo is...
he likes to be thorough.

639
00:33:44,457 --> 00:33:45,983
It was more than that.

640
00:33:46,028 --> 00:33:46,996
Commander...

641
00:33:47,031 --> 00:33:48,159
What makes you say that?

642
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,225
Instinct.

643
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:50,328
Jadzia.

644
00:33:50,439 --> 00:33:52,273
What?

645
00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:55,441
You asked to be told when the
sensor array became available.

646
00:33:55,484 --> 00:33:57,010
Thank you.

647
00:33:57,055 --> 00:33:58,319
Odo and a woman...

648
00:33:58,358 --> 00:34:00,922
it was bound to happen
sooner or later, right?

649
00:34:00,963 --> 00:34:02,626
I suppose.

650
00:34:02,668 --> 00:34:04,662
You can begin your experiment
at any time.

651
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:07,646
I'm talking to Kira.

652
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,015
You're not talking.
You're gossiping.

653
00:34:10,052 --> 00:34:12,319
And besides,
Odo is quite capable

654
00:34:12,357 --> 00:34:13,724
of taking care of himself.

655
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:15,595
Don't shout across the room.

656
00:34:15,632 --> 00:34:17,967
If you want to...
gossip with us

657
00:34:18,004 --> 00:34:19,337
then come down here.

658
00:34:19,441 --> 00:34:21,435
Where's Odo?

659
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,474
He asked me to arrange
a conference

660
00:34:23,518 --> 00:34:25,682
with Starfleet Intelligence
at 0800.

661
00:34:25,723 --> 00:34:27,454
I guess he's running late.

662
00:34:27,494 --> 00:34:28,758
He's never late.

663
00:34:28,797 --> 00:34:31,497
He's never spent the night
with a woman before.

664
00:34:31,537 --> 00:34:32,836
A woman?

665
00:34:32,874 --> 00:34:34,537
That's nice.

666
00:34:35,881 --> 00:34:37,350
Isn't it?

667
00:34:37,384 --> 00:34:39,081
Constable.

668
00:34:41,327 --> 00:34:42,887
Good morning.

669
00:34:42,931 --> 00:34:46,394
Starfleet Intelligence
is ready when you are.

670
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:56,956
Did you see the look
on Odo's face?

671
00:34:56,998 --> 00:34:59,835
I am telling you,
something happened.

672
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,836
I talked to Draim.

673
00:35:26,948 --> 00:35:28,851
The woman asked to make a deal.

674
00:35:28,952 --> 00:35:33,418
She gives us the crystal,
Draim lets her go.

675
00:35:33,463 --> 00:35:35,434
So we don't have to kill her.

676
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:36,834
Don't be stupid.

677
00:35:36,871 --> 00:35:40,141
As soon as we get
the crystal, she dies.

678
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,082
Oh.

679
00:35:42,117 --> 00:35:43,677
Makes sense.

680
00:35:49,033 --> 00:35:51,334
You can release the Talarian
as soon as he's sober

681
00:35:51,373 --> 00:35:53,776
but tell him to stay
away from the <i>raktajino.</i>

682
00:35:53,812 --> 00:35:55,372
It obviously doesn't
agree with him.

683
00:35:55,415 --> 00:35:57,112
I'll be in Science Lab 4.

684
00:35:58,423 --> 00:35:59,687
Can I help you?

685
00:35:59,726 --> 00:36:01,161
You're Security Chief Odo?

686
00:36:01,196 --> 00:36:02,563
Yes.

687
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:04,000
I'm here about the communication

688
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,562
you sent
to the Idanian government.

689
00:36:05,607 --> 00:36:07,338
- Go on.
- Where's Arissa?

690
00:36:07,378 --> 00:36:08,403
Is she safe?

691
00:36:09,416 --> 00:36:10,510
You know her?

692
00:36:10,552 --> 00:36:12,489
Better than she knows herself.

693
00:36:12,523 --> 00:36:14,049
What does that mean?

694
00:36:14,093 --> 00:36:16,064
She's not who she seems to be.

695
00:36:16,098 --> 00:36:18,866
She's an intelligence agent
with my government.

696
00:36:18,905 --> 00:36:22,037
She was sent to infiltrate
Draim's organization.

697
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,379
That's not possible.

698
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:24,886
She would have told me.

699
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,287
She doesn't know.

700
00:36:26,324 --> 00:36:28,055
I-I don't understand.

701
00:36:28,094 --> 00:36:31,033
We gave her a new identity
before we sent her in.

702
00:36:31,068 --> 00:36:32,196
All her previous memories

703
00:36:32,237 --> 00:36:34,265
were removed and stored
on the data crystal.

704
00:36:35,713 --> 00:36:37,946
If you take me to her,
I'll explain the rest.

705
00:36:51,182 --> 00:36:52,982
Chief, are you all right?

706
00:36:53,021 --> 00:36:54,320
The data crystal...
where is it?

707
00:36:54,357 --> 00:36:56,590
Forget about the crystal...
we've got to find Arissa.

708
00:36:56,629 --> 00:36:59,261
That crystal is Arissa.

709
00:36:59,302 --> 00:37:00,828
She took the crystal.

710
00:37:00,873 --> 00:37:02,673
I don't know where she went.

711
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,373
It generates
a distinctive signal.

712
00:37:04,415 --> 00:37:05,645
We might be able to track it.

713
00:37:13,302 --> 00:37:14,862
Is anyone here?

714
00:37:14,906 --> 00:37:16,843
Just me.

715
00:37:34,787 --> 00:37:36,484
What's wrong?

716
00:37:36,525 --> 00:37:37,824
I've lost it.

717
00:37:37,862 --> 00:37:39,525
The crystal's quantum signature

718
00:37:39,565 --> 00:37:41,502
starts to fade
after a few minutes.

719
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:46,343
Do you have it?

720
00:37:46,381 --> 00:37:47,349
Maybe.

721
00:37:47,384 --> 00:37:48,853
I thought we had a deal...

722
00:37:48,888 --> 00:37:51,189
your life for the crystal.

723
00:37:51,226 --> 00:37:54,598
I just want to make sure
that you live up to your end.

724
00:38:12,778 --> 00:38:14,509
Your turn.

725
00:38:14,549 --> 00:38:16,486
Do you really think
I'd be stupid enough

726
00:38:16,521 --> 00:38:17,922
to come here with a weapon?

727
00:38:19,628 --> 00:38:21,599
Indulge me.

728
00:38:32,425 --> 00:38:33,894
Very smart.

729
00:38:51,738 --> 00:38:55,144
Do you have any idea
what's on this?

730
00:38:55,213 --> 00:38:56,614
No.

731
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:59,782
You're going to have
to figure that out for yourself.

732
00:38:59,824 --> 00:39:01,658
Oh, don't go yet.

733
00:39:01,696 --> 00:39:04,065
You haven't met my associate.

734
00:39:08,011 --> 00:39:09,378
How are you?

735
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:11,111
Fine, thank you.

736
00:39:11,185 --> 00:39:14,124
Draim and I had a deal.

737
00:39:14,192 --> 00:39:17,655
He was in a very emotional state
when he agreed to it.

738
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,135
The truth is...

739
00:39:19,237 --> 00:39:22,142
you really hurt his
feelings when you left.

740
00:39:22,211 --> 00:39:24,011
He liked you.

741
00:39:24,049 --> 00:39:27,785
Maybe you should
close your eyes.

742
00:39:35,978 --> 00:39:37,881
You were supposed
to secure the doors.

743
00:39:37,915 --> 00:39:39,407
I did.

744
00:39:53,954 --> 00:39:55,013
Don't move!

745
00:39:59,668 --> 00:40:00,796
Are you all right?

746
00:40:00,837 --> 00:40:01,805
Yes.

747
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,645
I just wish I knew
what this is all about.

748
00:40:11,462 --> 00:40:14,026
The memory transfer
will take a few minutes.

749
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,234
How long was she undercover?

750
00:40:17,276 --> 00:40:19,976
She volunteered
for the operation two years ago.

751
00:40:20,016 --> 00:40:22,955
After we altered her memories,
we placed her on Finnea.

752
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,152
She woke up the next morning

753
00:40:24,193 --> 00:40:25,753
believing she was
a different person.

754
00:40:25,796 --> 00:40:29,032
With no memory of her former
life as an intelligence agent.

755
00:40:29,071 --> 00:40:30,974
That was crucial to the plan.

756
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,035
Draim employs telepaths

757
00:40:32,078 --> 00:40:33,638
to scan everyone
who works for him.

758
00:40:33,682 --> 00:40:35,311
It was the only way
to get past them.

759
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,288
We left her in place long enough

760
00:40:37,324 --> 00:40:40,422
to become a trusted member
of Draim's organization.

761
00:40:40,465 --> 00:40:44,031
When we were ready to recall
her, we had Tauvid make contact.

762
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:45,908
We'd imprinted a trace memory

763
00:40:45,946 --> 00:40:48,144
designed to make her feel
she could trust him.

764
00:40:48,184 --> 00:40:49,346
That way, she'd agree to meet.

765
00:40:49,453 --> 00:40:52,723
With what she knows about Draim,
we're going to be able

766
00:40:52,761 --> 00:40:54,492
to cripple
his entire organization.

767
00:40:54,533 --> 00:40:56,127
As soon as she's debriefed

768
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:58,107
we plan to issue
the indictments.

769
00:40:58,141 --> 00:41:01,114
You make it sound as if it all
went according to plan.

770
00:41:01,148 --> 00:41:02,617
She was nearly killed.

771
00:41:02,652 --> 00:41:04,144
She knew the risks
when she volunteered.

772
00:41:04,189 --> 00:41:05,852
We did everything we could
to minimize them.

773
00:41:05,892 --> 00:41:07,954
Every stage of this operation
was meticulously planned.

774
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:10,469
Including what just happened
in the cargo bay?

775
00:41:10,504 --> 00:41:12,532
Why didn't you tell us
what was going on

776
00:41:12,576 --> 00:41:14,011
when you found out Tauvid
had been killed?

777
00:41:14,046 --> 00:41:16,040
If Draim's people had
monitored the transmission

778
00:41:16,084 --> 00:41:18,021
it would've compromised
the entire operation.

779
00:41:18,055 --> 00:41:19,045
We couldn't risk it.

780
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:22,924
All that matters
is that she's safe...

781
00:41:22,967 --> 00:41:27,535
and that Draim is going
to prison for a long time.

782
00:41:30,585 --> 00:41:32,647
The transfer's complete.

783
00:41:32,691 --> 00:41:34,183
I'm going to take her
to surgery.

784
00:41:45,455 --> 00:41:46,822
Yes?

785
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,549
Arissa?

786
00:42:08,175 --> 00:42:09,769
That's...

787
00:42:09,813 --> 00:42:12,269
not even your name, is it?

788
00:42:16,379 --> 00:42:19,216
There's something
you need to know.

789
00:42:21,725 --> 00:42:24,357
I'm married.

790
00:42:24,398 --> 00:42:26,835
I have a husband.

791
00:42:30,078 --> 00:42:32,174
I see.

792
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:34,347
I'm so sorry.

793
00:42:34,389 --> 00:42:36,257
Don't be.

794
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:40,262
You didn't know.

795
00:42:43,778 --> 00:42:46,045
It's not your fault.

796
00:42:46,117 --> 00:42:50,219
I fell in love with a woman
who never really existed.

797
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,356
She did exist.

798
00:42:53,768 --> 00:42:56,069
She was real.

799
00:42:57,778 --> 00:42:59,772
And she loved you.

800
00:43:03,392 --> 00:43:05,386
In a way...

801
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:07,663
she still does.

802
00:43:17,626 --> 00:43:20,292
Will I ever see you again?

803
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:33,088
I... don't know.

804
00:43:36,003 --> 00:43:38,372
I'll never forget you, Odo.

805
00:43:39,411 --> 00:43:41,348
Never.
