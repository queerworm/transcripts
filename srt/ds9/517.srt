1
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,301
Computer. Time.

2
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:11,679
1821 hours.

3
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:16,224
(<i> door chimes</i> )

4
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:24,775
Can I help you?

5
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:25,860
I think so.

6
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,027
What are you doing?

7
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,571
(<i> grunts</i> )

8
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,532
(<i> groaning</i> )

9
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:32,491
Where is it?

10
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,034
Where is what?

11
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,161
I don't even know
what you're looking for.

12
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,496
Yes, you do.

13
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:38,497
Well?

14
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:39,748
It's not here.

15
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,333
That's not good.

16
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,377
Is it possible we
have the wrong man?

17
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:44,962
It's starting
to look that way.

18
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:47,046
This is very
embarrassing.

19
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,718
Now, listen to me.

20
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,219
We know why
you're here

21
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,971
we know who you
came to meet

22
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,556
and we know what you
are going to give her.

23
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,850
So for the last
time, where is it?

24
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,601
All right...

25
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,144
I'll take you to it.

26
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,104
You see? It<i> was</i>
<i>him all along.</i>

27
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:11,655
I thought it was on stun.

28
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:12,656
Huh.

29
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,074
Hmm.

30
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,159
Look what you did
to the carpet.

31
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,745
What do we do now?

32
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,413
We don't have time
to search the whole station.

33
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:20,748
We wait for the woman.

34
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:23,834
She might know
where he hid it.

35
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:27,880
You wanted to see us?

36
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,216
Is that the new
holosuite program?

37
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,426
BASHIR:
<i>Queen's Gambit.</i>

38
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,261
It came this morning.

39
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,430
O'BRIEN:
Finally-- that
friend of yours

40
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,015
promised to send it
two months ago.

41
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,725
According to Felix,
it's worth the wait.

42
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:41,060
He said it's the most
elaborate program

43
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,436
he's ever designed.

44
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,021
What parts do
we get to play?

45
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,731
Well, you get to play
Lady Wantsomore

46
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,357
a beautiful socialite
who's brainwashed

47
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,943
to assassinate the
Queen of England.

48
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:50,903
Ooh... somebody stop me.

49
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:52,320
What about me?

50
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,073
BASHIR:
Odo plays Nigel Dunlap

51
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:55,866
a former agent who
comes out of retirement

52
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,451
to help me foil this
diabolical plot.

53
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,702
Perfect.

54
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,287
BASHIR:
And<i> I</i> play--

55
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,956
Julian, we know
who<i> you</i> play.

56
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:03,248
What about me?

57
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,333
Well, you're Falcon,
of course.

58
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,294
Falcon? Again?

59
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:10,213
I'm tired of being the bad guy.

60
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:13,050
But you do it so well.

61
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,053
So... is everybody all right
for Saturday?

62
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,429
Fine.

63
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:18,973
No problem.

64
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,599
Odo?

65
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:24,519
Uh... what, what do you
want me to do again?

66
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,646
Save the Queen.

67
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,355
Not only that

68
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,483
you get to drive around
in fancy automobiles

69
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,485
and go to
posh parties.

70
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,987
Ah...

71
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:34,571
And steal<i> her</i>
<i>away from Falcon.</i>

72
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,698
He steals my girl?

73
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,283
Um...

74
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,953
maybe you'd better get
another Nigel Dunlap.

75
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,037
BASHIR:
Are you kidding?

76
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,204
Look at her.

77
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,499
(<i> sighs</i> )

78
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,501
I'm... I'm busy on Saturday.

79
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,670
We'll do it
when you're not busy.

80
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,964
I don't think so.

81
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,256
I'm sorry.

82
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,758
I... never
should have agreed

83
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,217
to be part of this
in the first place.

84
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:59,096
Sorry.

85
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,681
Well, it looks like
we'll have to find

86
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,181
someone else
to play Odo's part.

87
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:06,687
I'll do it.

88
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,819
WOMAN:
I've already told you--

89
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,822
I don't want to play dabo,
I don't want a holosuite

90
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,158
and I don't want
anything to eat.

91
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:20,742
Can I interest you

92
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,370
in my collection of
Risean tapestries?

93
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,413
Why don't you leave her alone,
Quark?

94
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,290
Can't you see she's
not interested?

95
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,835
How do I know she's
not interested...

96
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,712
unless I ask?

97
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,339
Maybe you should spend
less time

98
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,008
bothering your customers

99
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:37,968
and more time keeping an eye
on your business?

100
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,762
Don't worry.

101
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,139
I can keep my eyes

102
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,224
on more than one
thing at a time.

103
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,475
Really?

104
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,102
What about him?

105
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,270
He's got a
graviton emitter

106
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,065
hidden in his ring.

107
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:53,817
He's manipulating the table
for his friend over there.

108
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,235
Dabo!
Dabo!

109
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,034
You're very observant.

110
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:04,244
Thanks.

111
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,289
Are you waiting for someone?

112
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,086
You.

113
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:13,837
Where have you been all my life?

114
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,380
Pardon me?

115
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,298
Isn't that what you
were hoping I'd say?

116
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,552
No, it's just that you
keep glancing at the door.

117
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,971
I'm waiting for someone.

118
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,433
That's all I meant.

119
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,143
Sorry.

120
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:31,063
I thought you had other things
on your mind.

121
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:36,068
Must be those bedroom eyes
of yours.

122
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:37,986
Bedroom eyes?

123
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,156
You probably get that
all the time.

124
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,533
Not really.

125
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:49,081
If anyone bothers you again...

126
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:50,457
let me know.

127
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,458
I'm Security Chief Odo.

128
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,793
My office is

129
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,753
just across
the Promenade.

130
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,465
I'll be all right.

131
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,717
Well...

132
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,302
I have to go...

133
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,265
to work...

134
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:07,975
in my office.

135
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,476
Across the Promenade.

136
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,145
Exactly.

137
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,860
Look at this.

138
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,112
I was checking
the contents

139
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,405
of one of those crates.

140
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:27,572
A tentacle
grabbed my hand.

141
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,324
<i>Gagh.</i>

142
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,909
Klingons have been getting
regular shipments of it

143
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,411
since the day they
were posted here.

144
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:33,412
I can't believe
they eat that stuff.

145
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:34,495
Hmm.

146
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,496
What are you doing?

147
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,623
Nothing.

148
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,582
What are you looking at?

149
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,666
Well, I'm...

150
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,667
(<i> sighs</i> )

151
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,254
Actually, I'm...

152
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,255
Never mind.

153
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:44,339
What?

154
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,549
Ah... it's embarrassing.

155
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,135
Would you just tell me?

156
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:51,930
Well, last night...
a woman in Quark's

157
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,849
told me I have...
bedroom eyes.

158
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,935
I'm trying to see
if it's true.

159
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,813
Tell me about this woman.

160
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:03,691
She thought I was trying
to seduce her.

161
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,027
It was all just
a misunderstanding.

162
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,696
If you say so.

163
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,199
You going to see her again?

164
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,909
I have no idea. Why?

165
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,744
Obviously,
she's very perceptive.

166
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,955
Meaning what?

167
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,498
Meaning...

168
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,419
you should see her again.

169
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,479
Hello again.

170
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,730
What's this all about?

171
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,568
You tried to break
into the station computer.

172
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,154
Why?

173
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,822
My friend never
showed up last night.

174
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,074
I wanted to check
the passenger manifests

175
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,993
to find out if
he came aboard.

176
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,536
Why didn't you come to me?

177
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,746
I could've checked
the manifests for you.

178
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,999
When you grow up
on Finnea Prime

179
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,293
you learn not
to trust policemen.

180
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,173
Dataport bothering you?

181
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,927
The security protocols
protecting your computer

182
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,138
generated some nasty feedback.

183
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,348
I know.

184
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,975
I designed them that way.

185
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,268
Nice job.

186
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,229
I couldn't
stay interfaced

187
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,981
long enough to break
past the encryption lockouts.

188
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,649
That was the idea.

189
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,823
Tell me, Arissa...

190
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:37,118
what's a nice woman like you
doing with a dataport?

191
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,661
They're not illegal.

192
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,330
They ought to be.

193
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,332
People tend to use them
to access information

194
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,751
other people don't want them
to access.

195
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,711
I've heard that.

196
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,630
This Idanian you were
waiting for in Quark's--

197
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,132
Tauvid Rem--

198
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,176
what were you meeting him about?

199
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,263
A personal matter.

200
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:59,891
Well, I suppose I could just
go to his quarters and ask him.

201
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,935
I'd rather you didn't.

202
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,188
It's a delicate situation.

203
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,525
I'm listening.

204
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,113
Tauvid's well-known for...

205
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,781
finding people--

206
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:18,076
people who don't necessarily
want to be found.

207
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,997
He's helping me
locate my daughter.

208
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,874
I gave her up

209
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,668
when she was born 15 years ago.

210
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,921
I see.

211
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,715
He told me he had information
about her.

212
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,301
That's all I know.

213
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,639
I've been looking for her
for a long time.

214
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,017
Please...

215
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,061
let me talk to him.

216
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,440
All right.

217
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,569
I'll take you to him.

218
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:55,029
We'll sort out the rest later.

219
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,323
Thank you.

220
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,916
Maybe he's not in.

221
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,545
According to the access log,
he's inside.

222
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:16,259
It's Security.

223
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:18,886
Hello?

224
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,486
He's not here.

225
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,615
Oh, yes, he is...

226
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,450
what's left of him.

227
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:52,379
The residue we found
contains Idanian DNA.

228
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,047
I think it's
safe to assume

229
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,674
that it came
from Tauvid Rem.

230
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,175
Do you have any idea

231
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,052
why someone would
want to kill him?

232
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:02,681
No, but considering
what he did for a living

233
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:04,307
he probably had dealings

234
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,185
with all sorts
of marginal characters.

235
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,145
Maybe it was a robbery.

236
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,064
What makes you say that?

237
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,526
I didn't see any personal
belongings in his quarters.

238
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:17,111
Did your deputies find anything?

239
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,573
No.

240
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,408
Well, whatever happened

241
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,118
I doubt it had anything
to do with me or my daughter.

242
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,621
Now, that depends.

243
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,999
It's possible someone doesn't
want you to find your daughter.

244
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,293
Tauvid didn't give me
any indication of that

245
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,420
when we spoke.

246
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,837
When was that?

247
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,297
About three days ago.

248
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,300
Oh, I can't believe this.

249
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,968
I was so close to finding her

250
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,346
and now I'm going to have
to start all over again.

251
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,848
That's if you'll let me.

252
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:46,974
If?

253
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,935
In case you'd forgotten

254
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:52,230
I'm facing charges for trying
to break into your computer.

255
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,816
Considering you weren't
able to access

256
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,152
any secured information...

257
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:01,406
I've decided
to drop those charges.

258
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,659
I appreciate that very much.

259
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,828
You're free to go.

260
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,457
Thank you.

261
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,584
You're a very kind man.

262
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,628
I hope you find your daughter.

263
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,494
(<i> rhythmic beeping</i> )

264
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,931
(<i> pounding on door</i> )

265
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,433
Morn!

266
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:14,646
We're closed.

267
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,816
Go home.

268
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,235
(<i> sighs</i> )

269
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,541
ODO:
I'm afraid the
Assay Office

270
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,250
is closed for the evening.

271
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:40,880
If you want to secure
any valuables

272
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,841
you'll have to come back
in the morning.

273
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,009
Thanks.
I'll do that.

274
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,970
I didn't realize
I tripped an alarm.

275
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:48,971
You didn't.

276
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,724
You're good.

277
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,933
I still got caught.

278
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,811
I've been following you.

279
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:55,895
I didn't know.

280
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,480
I'm good, too.

281
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,192
So...

282
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:04,404
did you find anything
in Tauvid's locker?

283
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,823
Would you believe me
if I said no?

284
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,992
Actually, I'd have
you strip searched.

285
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,578
That might be fun.

286
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,163
But in the interest
of saving time...

287
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:18,543
I've never seen a data crystal
quite like this.

288
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:21,629
Looks like it has a phase
inverter embedded inside it.

289
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,882
It's not going to be easy
to decode.

290
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:26,467
Given that all it contains
is information

291
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,135
about a missing girl

292
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,555
Tauvid went to great lengths
to secure it.

293
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,223
You know how Idanians are.

294
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,892
They're a secretive race.

295
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,976
You realize it would
be a simple matter

296
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,062
for me to have you
examined by a doctor

297
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,732
to determine if you've
ever been pregnant.

298
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:44,444
You keep threatening to have me
stripped down and examined.

299
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,863
I'm trying not to read
too much into that.

300
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,490
You don't have a daughter,
do you?

301
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,787
No.

302
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:57,248
That's probably the first true
statement I've heard you make.

303
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,833
Not quite.

304
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,669
I meant what I said
about your eyes.

305
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,507
What's on the crystal?

306
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,469
I don't know,
but I need to find out.

307
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,762
Why?

308
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,972
Because if I don't, I'm dead.

309
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,689
Maybe you'd better start
at the beginning.

310
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,026
I work for a man named Draim.

311
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,320
Ah.

312
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,238
I see you've heard of him.

313
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,949
He's with the
Orion Syndicate.

314
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:32,659
If I'm not mistaken

315
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,411
he specializes in blackmail
and extortion.

316
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,581
How do you fit in
with his organization?

317
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,500
I access
computer systems

318
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,085
and steal information
for him--

319
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,546
government data,
business plans

320
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,089
whatever he asks for.

321
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,591
I hope you're well paid.

322
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,468
It's a very dangerous
line of work.

323
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,720
Trigger the wrong
security protocol

324
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,473
you could end up with
permanent brain damage.

325
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,892
I think about that
from time to time

326
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,687
but there's not much
I can do about it.

327
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,147
You don't quit
the Orion Syndicate

328
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,607
unless they say you can.

329
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:07,401
Do you<i> want</i> to quit?

330
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,779
That's why I came
to meet Tauvid.

331
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,030
Who was he?

332
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,573
I don't know.

333
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,075
Then why did you
come to meet him?

334
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,744
He told me
he had information--

335
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,121
information I could use
to break away

336
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,999
from Draim free and clear.

337
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,376
What made you believe that
he was telling the truth?

338
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,711
I don't know.

339
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,462
I just did.

340
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,924
I'm not even sure how
he knew I wanted to get out.

341
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:32,552
Did he tell you what
this information was?

342
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,136
No.

343
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:38,391
But for some reason,
I decided to trust him.

344
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,101
Oh, I know this sounds insane.

345
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,229
I guess I was desperate.

346
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,648
Did you tell anyone
you were coming here?

347
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,274
No, but Draim
must have monitored

348
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,902
my communication.

349
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:51,654
How else could he have
gotten his people here

350
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:52,780
before I arrived?

351
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,990
So you think

352
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,575
Draim had Tauvid killed

353
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,785
to stop you
from getting this crystal.

354
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,245
And whoever he hired

355
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,288
is probably still
on the station.

356
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,457
You can be sure that
Draim wants to know

357
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,002
what's on that crystal
as much as I do.

358
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,547
What are you
smiling about?

359
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:13,509
Oh, I'm just picturing myself
trying to explain all this

360
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,220
to the authorities
back on Finnea...

361
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,680
not that they'll listen.

362
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,266
They'll just send
me to prison.

363
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:23,561
I'm not turning this over
to the Finneans.

364
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,271
You're not?

365
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,648
I'm placing you
in protective custody

366
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,526
while I have someone
try to access the crystal.

367
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,319
In the meantime, I want you

368
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,072
to look at security recordings
made at the airlocks.

369
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,824
Draim was probably careful
not to send anyone

370
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,993
you'd recognize,
but you never know.

371
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,412
Why are you doing this?

372
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:42,914
Doing what?

373
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:44,082
Helping me.

374
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:45,458
Why not?

375
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,960
You mean, you're just doing this

376
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,586
out of the kindness
of your heart?

377
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,923
I... don't have a heart.

378
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:54,968
You could have fooled me.

379
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,599
What'd you get?

380
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,852
It's called<i> hasperat.</i>

381
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,354
Where is she?

382
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:14,278
She's with that changeling
Security Chief.

383
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,905
Spicy.

384
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,197
Mmm.

385
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,576
They have the crystal.

386
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:24,080
We've got to make sure
she doesn't access it.

387
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,414
She's so pretty.

388
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,041
I was hoping

389
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,960
we wouldn't have
to kill her.

390
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,504
You'll get over it.

391
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,593
Nice room.

392
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,970
Don't get too
used to it.

393
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,262
You're not
staying here.

394
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,931
Odo to Security.

395
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,808
Begin transport.

396
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,067
There.

397
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,861
Now, if anyone
was watching

398
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,487
they'll think you're still
in the other quarters.

399
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:57,655
Hmm. Good trick.

400
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:58,739
Hope it works.

401
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,367
Interesting furniture.

402
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,620
I use these things to
practice shape-shifting.

403
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,289
These are your quarters?

404
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,333
I thought this would
be the last place

405
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,418
anyone would
look for you.

406
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:14,172
There's a bed
in the other room.

407
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,716
I was planning
to stay out here

408
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,467
so I could keep
an eye on you...

409
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,386
if that's all right.

410
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,763
I could use the company.

411
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,391
I have two deputies

412
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,309
stationed outside
in the corridor

413
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,521
posing as a maintenance
crew doing repairs.

414
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:33,066
And where are you
going to sleep?

415
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,568
I don't need a bed.

416
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,778
I regenerate by reverting

417
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,321
to a gelatinous state.

418
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,948
Mmm. Sounds relaxing.

419
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,036
It is actually.

420
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:48,330
I'm so tired,
I wouldn't mind

421
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,917
being in a gelatinous
state myself.

422
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:55,004
I understand you haven't
been able to identify anyone

423
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,423
from the security recordings.

424
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,634
No.

425
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,928
I haven't had much luck

426
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,763
identifying Tauvid either.

427
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,389
It's not his real name.

428
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,767
He took
three different transports

429
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,770
to get to the station-- used a
different identity each time.

430
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,438
I've transmitted

431
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,440
a picture of him
to the Idanian authorities.

432
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,275
I'm not sure we'll get a reply.

433
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,112
As you said before,
they're a very secretive race.

434
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,279
What about the crystal?

435
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,198
Dax and
Chief O'Brien

436
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:25,785
are still trying to get
past the encryption lockouts.

437
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,536
I could try to interface
with it.

438
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,829
No, that's not

439
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,372
a good idea.

440
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,374
The first time
they attempted to access it

441
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,543
the feedback
shorted out the computer.

442
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,463
I'd hate to see what that
would do to your dataport.

443
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:40,758
Oh, I can't believe
what I got myself into--

444
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:43,886
walking out on Draim to meet
someone I don't even know.

445
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,138
I must have been
out of my mind.

446
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:46,139
You said you were desperate.

447
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,848
Why do you think

448
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,809
I got involved with Draim
in the first place?

449
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,979
I know life on Finnea isn't easy

450
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:56,190
but you must have had
other options.

451
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,942
Have you ever been there?

452
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,777
No.

453
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,155
It's not like a
Federation world

454
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,740
where everything
is handed to you.

455
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,493
You know how I
ended up with this?

456
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:11,747
I was a net-girl.

457
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:15,001
I told myself
I wasn't selling

458
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:18,337
my body since there
was no actual contact...

459
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,214
but I was.

460
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:23,383
I let men into
my mind for money.

461
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,927
Draim was
one of them.

462
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,971
That's how
we first met.

463
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:30,099
Before I knew it, I
was working for him.

464
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:33,393
He paid me more than
I'd ever seen before.

465
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,815
I was so far removed

466
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:40,318
from the consequences
of what I was doing

467
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:44,488
it was easy to pretend
that I wasn't hurting anyone.

468
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:47,658
I'd hear things now and then.

469
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:52,205
Some businessman Draim had me
investigate would disappear.

470
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:55,958
I tried to convince myself
it had nothing to do with me

471
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:59,461
but after a while,
I couldn't pretend anymore.

472
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,421
I wanted out.

473
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,133
I guess I'm
finally going

474
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,177
to get my wish.

475
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:10,597
Only problem is I'll be dead.

476
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,433
Oh, I don't want to cry.

477
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,811
The dead don't cry.

478
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,314
Arissa...

479
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:21,108
I'm not going to let
anyone harm you.

480
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,862
You have to trust me.

481
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,532
I do trust you.

482
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:33,495
But you can't
protect me forever.

483
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,249
Sooner or later,
Draim will get to me.

484
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:40,378
I've got to find out
what's on that crystal.

485
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:42,338
I don't think you can
count on whatever's

486
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,131
on that crystal
to get you out of this.

487
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,675
If that's true,
I don't have a chance.

488
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,094
Yes, you do.

489
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,012
If you testified
against Draim

490
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:52,848
you could put him in prison
for the rest of his life.

491
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,559
You could get immunity
for any past crimes

492
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,144
you may have committed--
start a new life.

493
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,938
Testify against Draim?

494
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,981
I would never make it
to the witness stand.

495
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,816
I will take personal
responsibility

496
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,151
for your safety.

497
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,070
I don't care
how long it takes.

498
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,864
If I have to ask for a
leave of absence, I will.

499
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,075
You'd do that for me?

500
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,327
Why?

501
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:20,626
I've done things in my
life I'm not proud of, too.

502
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,379
You worked for Draim.

503
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,340
I worked for
the Cardassians.

504
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:30,010
I never had the
courage to walk away.

505
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,720
You did.

506
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,097
I admire that.

507
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:34,681
Oh... wait a minute.

508
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:37,059
You're going to have
to give me a minute

509
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,518
to get used to this.

510
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,980
I've never been admired
for anything

511
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,648
other than the way I look.

512
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,984
Most people can't see
past the surface--

513
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:48,154
especially when what they see
is so beautiful.

514
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,993
I'm... I-I'm sorry.
I merely meant...

515
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,162
Don't apologize.

516
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,376
Well...

517
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,086
I'm going to see

518
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:07,340
if they've made any progress
decoding the crystal.

519
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,049
Make yourself comfortable.

520
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,093
I'll check in on you later.

521
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,220
I'm not going anywhere.

522
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,277
Let me help
you with that.

523
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,029
(<i> car horn honks in passing</i> )

524
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,114
Extraordinary.

525
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:35,701
You just jumped out of
an airplane at 20,000 feet

526
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:39,705
and yet, there's not a hair
on your head out of place.

527
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:42,082
(<i> knock at window</i> )

528
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:48,172
Odo.

529
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,508
I'm sorry to interrupt.

530
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:52,718
I need to talk to you.

531
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:54,261
Alone.

532
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,724
Um, driver,
stop the car.

533
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:01,727
Uh, we'll just
be a minute.

534
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:14,073
Uh, isn't that the woman
I was supposed to steal

535
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,699
away from Falcon?

536
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,077
Well, uh, yes, but since
you didn't show up...

537
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,912
You swept her off her feet.

538
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,122
Sort of.

539
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,832
Tell me...

540
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,126
how did you know
she was interested?

541
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,961
It's that kind of program.

542
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,796
What<i> is</i> this all about, Odo?

543
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:32,883
You didn't come here
to talk to me about women...

544
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,134
Did you?

545
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,136
Ah...

546
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,264
This is about bedroom eyes

547
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:39,639
isn't it?

548
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,141
Who told you about her?
Kira?

549
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,142
Nope.

550
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,269
Dax.

551
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,311
Actually, it was Miles.

552
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,021
Oh...

553
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,107
If people are talking,
it's only because they care.

554
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,942
You put on a good front

555
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:51,818
but anyone who really knows you
can tell that you're lonely.

556
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,653
If you're interested
in this woman

557
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:54,654
you have to let her know.

558
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:55,697
Oh, I can't.

559
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:56,865
Why not?

560
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:00,618
What if I...?

561
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:02,913
What if she...?

562
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:04,415
Rejects you?

563
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:07,334
She might... but you
can't go through life

564
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,587
trying to avoid
getting a broken heart.

565
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:12,423
If you do, it'll break
from loneliness anyway.

566
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:14,716
So you might as well
take a chance.

567
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,427
If you don't,
she'll move on

568
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:18,678
and you'll never know
what you might have had

569
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:21,848
and living with that is worse
than having a broken heart.

570
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,183
Believe me.

571
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,269
(<i> knock at window</i> )

572
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:26,520
We're nearly finished,
darling.

573
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:30,608
Car trouble, Mr. Bashir?

574
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:31,775
Hi, Odo.

575
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,153
I-I should go.

576
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:35,653
Thank you, Doctor.

577
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,948
Odo...

578
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:39,116
This isn't fair.

579
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:40,618
Odo and I were talking.

580
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:41,994
Didn't anyone ever tell you

581
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,870
you shouldn't stop
for hitchhikers?

582
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,205
(<i> evil chuckle</i> )

583
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,373
(<i> groan of frustration</i> )

584
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,502
(<i> door opening</i> )

585
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:54,173
Hello.

586
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,549
Hello.

587
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,804
I... didn't expect
to find you awake.

588
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,515
I couldn't sleep.

589
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:05,351
Uh, if the bed
is uncomfortable, I...

590
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:06,935
The bed is fine.

591
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,772
I guess you have no news for me?

592
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,191
Chief O'Brien

593
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,859
is going to run a quantum scan

594
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,819
on the crystal in the morning.

595
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,571
I'd like to be there.

596
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:19,490
I might be able to help.

597
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,074
I'll arrange it.

598
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,870
I'm not in your way, am I?

599
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,246
No.

600
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:29,749
No, not at all.

601
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:33,795
I, uh...

602
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:37,090
I usually read
for an hour or two.

603
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,678
What are you reading?

604
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,806
It's a detective novel.

605
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:48,352
Oh. Have you figured out
who did it yet?

606
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:50,354
By the third page.

607
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:51,897
Well...

608
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:56,652
I should let you
get back to your book.

609
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,904
I...

610
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,448
don't really feel
like reading.

611
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,120
Perhaps we could
talk for a while.

612
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:11,750
What do you want
to talk about?

613
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,151
Hmm. Tell me more.

614
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,871
ARISSA:
I could swear that
when we first met...

615
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,458
your nose had a<i> little</i>
<i>curve right here.</i>

616
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,251
Hmm.

617
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:58,213
Oh, I tend to look
a<i> little</i> different every day.

618
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:02,760
But you always manage
to make these the same.

619
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,764
Well, I pay special
attention to my scowl.

620
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:09,516
An air of stern suspicion

621
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,727
is very important
in my line of work.

622
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:12,936
(<i> growls</i> )

623
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,485
What?

624
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:22,195
Why are you looking
at me that way?

625
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,032
I'm...

626
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,868
just trying to figure
something out.

627
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,246
Tell me.

628
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,956
Maybe I can help.

629
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:39,004
You're the first woman
I've ever been...

630
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:40,380
close with.

631
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:45,469
I've never been able
to let down my guard.

632
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,848
I was just wondering...

633
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,225
what makes you different.

634
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,105
Wait a minute.

635
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,859
Have you never been
with anyone else before?

636
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,237
Not with a humanoid.

637
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,324
Well, once...

638
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:09,951
on my homeworld, I...

639
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,371
had an experience
you might consider...

640
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,791
sexual.

641
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,252
But never with
a woman before.

642
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:23,006
Could you tell?

643
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,508
No.

644
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,678
Good.

645
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,570
(<i> groans</i> )

646
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:49,282
I don't ever want
to leave this room.

647
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,827
Can we stay here forever?

648
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:54,580
Oh, I wish we could.

649
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,918
Arissa?

650
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:03,004
Everything...

651
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,215
is going to work out.

652
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:08,218
I want to believe that

653
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,804
but I know what
the Orion Syndicate

654
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:13,098
does to people who
turn against them.

655
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:16,602
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life

656
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:18,771
looking over my shoulder.

657
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,401
Oh, I'm sorry.

658
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:26,278
I shouldn't have
brought it up.

659
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,449
Let's just be together.

660
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,326
All right.

661
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:49,050
Tell me more about
this encounter you had

662
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,427
on your homeworld.

663
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:51,678
Hmm?

664
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:55,140
It was with
another changeling.

665
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:58,477
Our bodies...

666
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,520
became...

667
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,648
intermingled...

668
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:05,734
Mmm. Sounds nice.

669
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:06,902
Hmm.

670
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:11,531
Too bad I'm not
a changeling.

671
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,701
Oh, we shouldn't
let that stop us.

672
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:26,087
(<i> gasps</i> )

673
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:34,429
DAX:
She spent the night
in his quarters.

674
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,723
KIRA:
He had her under
protective custody.

675
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,308
Come on, Nerys.

676
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:40,101
He could have put
her somewhere else.

677
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,729
You know how Odo is--
he likes to be thorough.

678
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,397
It was more than that.

679
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,649
Commander...

680
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:46,608
What makes you
say that?

681
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:47,734
Instinct.

682
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:48,777
Jadzia.

683
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,779
What?

684
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:53,782
You asked to be told when the
sensor array became available.

685
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:55,450
Thank you.

686
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,076
Odo and a woman--

687
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:59,287
it was bound to happen
sooner or later, right?

688
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,998
I suppose.

689
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:03,082
You can begin your experiment
at any time.

690
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,836
I'm talking to Kira.

691
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:08,463
You're not talking.
You're gossiping.

692
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,757
And besides, Odo
is quite capable

693
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,050
of taking care of himself.

694
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,927
Don't shout
across the room.

695
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:16,429
If you want to...
<i>gossip</i> with us

696
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,723
then come down here.

697
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:19,683
SISKO:
Where's Odo?

698
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:21,727
He asked me to arrange
a conference

699
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:23,896
with Starfleet Intelligence
at 0800.

700
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:25,772
I guess he's
running late.

701
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,106
He's never late.

702
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,567
He's never
spent the night

703
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:29,818
with a woman
before.

704
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:31,152
A woman?

705
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,988
That's nice.

706
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,824
Isn't it?

707
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,534
Constable.

708
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,454
Good morning.

709
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:44,917
Starfleet Intelligence
is ready when you are.

710
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:55,218
Did you see the look
on Odo's face?

711
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:58,179
I am telling you,
something happened.

712
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,832
I talked to Draim.

713
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,834
The woman asked
to make a deal.

714
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:32,338
She gives us the crystal,
Draim lets her go.

715
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,382
So we don't have
to kill her.

716
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,926
Don't be stupid.

717
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:39,054
As soon as we get
the crystal, she dies.

718
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,973
Oh.

719
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:42,724
Makes sense.

720
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:50,231
You can release the Talarian
as soon as he's sober

721
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,692
but tell him to stay
away from the<i> raktajino.</i>

722
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,235
It obviously doesn't
agree with him.

723
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,071
I'll be in Science Lab 4.

724
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,615
Can I help you?

725
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:00,117
You're
Security Chief Odo?

726
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:01,576
Yes.

727
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,036
I'm here about the communication

728
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:04,537
you sent
to the Idanian government.

729
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,164
Go on.
Where's Arissa?

730
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,415
Is she safe?

731
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,668
You know her?

732
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,503
Better than she knows herself.

733
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:12,921
What does that mean?

734
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,881
She's not who she seems to be.

735
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,843
She's an intelligence agent
with my government.

736
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:20,887
She was sent to infiltrate
Draim's organization.

737
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,305
That's not possible.

738
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,890
She would have told me.

739
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,142
She doesn't know.

740
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:26,893
I-I don't understand.

741
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,646
We gave her a new identity
before we sent her in.

742
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,230
All her previous memories

743
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,191
were removed and stored
on the data crystal.

744
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,029
If you take me to her,
I'll explain the rest.

745
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,916
(<i> groaning</i> )

746
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,334
Chief, are you all right?

747
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,252
The data crystal--
where is it?

748
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,421
Forget about the crystal--
we've got to find Arissa.

749
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:58,133
That crystal
<i>is</i> Arissa.

750
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,759
She took the crystal.

751
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,594
I don't know
where she went.

752
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,304
It generates a
distinctive signal.

753
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,681
We might be able
to track it.

754
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:13,940
Is anyone here?

755
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,901
Just me.

756
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:34,961
What's wrong?

757
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,295
I've lost it.

758
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,964
The crystal's
quantum signature

759
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,050
starts to fade
after a few minutes.

760
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:44,846
Do you have it?

761
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,014
Maybe.

762
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,265
I thought we
had a deal--

763
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,601
your life for the crystal.

764
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:53,146
I just want to make sure
that you live up to your end.

765
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:12,874
Your turn.

766
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:15,001
Do you really think
I'd be stupid enough

767
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,335
to come here with a weapon?

768
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,173
Indulge me.

769
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:32,560
Very smart.

770
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:53,539
Do you have any idea
what's on this?

771
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,374
No.

772
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:58,003
You're going to have to
figure that out for yourself.

773
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:00,005
Oh, don't go yet.

774
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,507
You haven't met
my associate.

775
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,887
How are you?

776
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,597
Fine, thank you.

777
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,558
Draim and I had a deal.

778
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,644
He was in a very
emotional state

779
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,104
when he agreed to it.

780
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:17,689
The truth is...

781
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:20,566
you really hurt his
feelings when you left.

782
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,360
He liked you.

783
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,072
Maybe you should
close your eyes.

784
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,449
(<i> doors opening</i> )

785
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:36,208
You were supposed
to secure the doors.

786
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,876
I did.

787
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,350
Don't move!

788
00:39:58,063 --> 00:39:59,147
Are you all right?

789
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:00,690
Yes.

790
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:04,110
I just wish I knew
what this is all about.

791
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:12,327
The memory transfer
will take a few minutes.

792
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,538
How long was she undercover?

793
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:18,166
She volunteered
for the operation two years ago.

794
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,835
After we altered her memories,
we placed her on Finnea.

795
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,461
She woke up the next morning

796
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,547
believing she was
a different person.

797
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:27,259
With no memory of her former
life as an intelligence agent.

798
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:28,843
That was crucial to the plan.

799
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,345
Draim employs telepaths

800
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,055
to scan everyone
who works for him.

801
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,598
It was the only way
to get past them.

802
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,516
We left her in
place long enough

803
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:38,644
to become a trusted member
of Draim's organization.

804
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:40,563
When we were ready
to recall her

805
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,107
we had Tauvid
make contact.

806
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:44,150
We'd imprinted
a trace memory

807
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,319
designed to make her feel
she could trust him.

808
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,820
That way, she'd
agree to meet.

809
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,447
With what she
knows about Draim

810
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,074
we're going to be able

811
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:52,658
to cripple his
entire organization.

812
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,327
As soon as
she's debriefed

813
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,246
we plan to issue
the indictments.

814
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:59,040
You make it sound as if it all
went according to plan.

815
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,666
She was nearly killed.

816
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,460
She knew the risks
when she volunteered.

817
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,920
We did everything we could
to minimize them.

818
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,255
Every stage of
this operation

819
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:06,923
was meticulously planned.

820
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,674
Including what just happened
in the cargo bay?

821
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,509
Why didn't you tell us
what was going on

822
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,304
when you found out Tauvid
had been killed?

823
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:14,139
If Draim's people had
monitored the transmission

824
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:16,182
it would've compromised
the entire operation.

825
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,392
We couldn't risk it.

826
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:21,146
All that matters
is that she's safe...

827
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:25,900
and that Draim is going
to prison for a long time.

828
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,863
The transfer's complete.

829
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,449
I'm going to take
her to surgery.

830
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,668
(<i> door chimes</i> )

831
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:45,170
Yes?

832
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,046
(<i> door opens</i> )

833
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,095
(<i> door closes</i> )

834
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:58,850
Arissa?

835
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:06,316
(<i> gasps</i> )

836
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:08,151
That's...

837
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:11,070
not even your name, is it?

838
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:18,036
There's something
you need to know.

839
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:23,166
I'm married.

840
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,543
I have a husband.

841
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,882
I see.

842
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:33,092
I'm so sorry.

843
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,053
Don't be.

844
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,057
You didn't know.

845
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,687
It's not your fault.

846
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:48,983
I fell in love with a woman
who never really existed.

847
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,152
She did exist.

848
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,780
She was real.

849
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:58,493
And she loved you.

850
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,249
In a way...

851
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,501
she still does.

852
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:19,097
Will I ever
see you again?

853
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,817
I... don't know.

854
00:43:34,571 --> 00:43:37,156
I'll never forget you, Odo.

855
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:40,118
Never.
