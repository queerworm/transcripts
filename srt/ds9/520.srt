1
00:00:13,735 --> 00:00:15,833
Who's winning the war?

2
00:00:15,876 --> 00:00:18,076
It's too early to tell.

3
00:00:18,116 --> 00:00:19,609
It's been three days.

4
00:00:19,654 --> 00:00:21,181
Don't remind me.

5
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:24,725
They found a nest.

6
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:25,864
Well, that's good.

7
00:00:25,908 --> 00:00:27,435
It's not the main nest.

8
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:29,075
That's not so good.

9
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:31,250
I thought Chief O'Brien

10
00:00:31,292 --> 00:00:34,530
trapped the last vole
on the station months ago.

11
00:00:34,569 --> 00:00:36,268
Well, obviously,
he missed a couple...

12
00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:38,644
a married couple.

13
00:00:38,682 --> 00:00:39,879
They breed like tribbles.

14
00:00:39,919 --> 00:00:42,485
But they're not as cute.

15
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:44,762
They're disgusting
hairy little creatures

16
00:00:44,801 --> 00:00:47,070
with ravenous appetites,
and I want them gone.

17
00:00:47,108 --> 00:00:48,305
Oh, Quark.

18
00:00:48,346 --> 00:00:49,680
I know, I know...

19
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,244
this is just
a temporary setback.

20
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:54,059
The bar will open again,
and I can get back to my life.

21
00:00:54,098 --> 00:00:55,466
I'm glad you realize that.

22
00:00:55,502 --> 00:00:57,474
The only trouble is,
I hate my life.

23
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:06,994
Come in.

24
00:01:08,176 --> 00:01:09,669
Hello, Brother.

25
00:01:09,714 --> 00:01:11,481
What do you want?

26
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,424
You have every right
to be depressed, Brother.

27
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:15,090
Ever since you were blacklisted

28
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:16,830
by the Ferengi
Commerce Authority

29
00:01:16,871 --> 00:01:19,174
it's been one thing
after another, but...

30
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:22,780
I have some news
that's going to cheer you up.

31
00:01:22,823 --> 00:01:23,792
I doubt it.

32
00:01:23,826 --> 00:01:25,627
Trust me on this one, Brother.

33
00:01:25,665 --> 00:01:29,005
I'm about to make you
very, very happy.

34
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:30,033
Really?

35
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,070
Really.

36
00:01:31,116 --> 00:01:32,781
Come on in.

37
00:01:38,339 --> 00:01:39,935
What's she doing here?

38
00:01:39,977 --> 00:01:42,416
We're getting married!

39
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,754
Oh... I wish I was dead.

40
00:01:44,793 --> 00:01:47,529
He's been a little depressed
lately.

41
00:01:47,568 --> 00:01:49,369
I don't want to live.

42
00:01:49,407 --> 00:01:52,007
I think you need someone
to talk to...

43
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,714
someone to pamper you.

44
00:01:53,755 --> 00:01:56,160
I think I need to be alone.

45
00:01:56,196 --> 00:01:58,864
You know who I talk to
when I'm feeling a little low?

46
00:01:58,904 --> 00:02:00,204
Yeah, me.

47
00:02:00,242 --> 00:02:01,838
Not when it's something
really important.

48
00:02:01,881 --> 00:02:04,982
Let me guess...
Chief O'Brien?

49
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:06,517
That's not a bad guess.

50
00:02:06,562 --> 00:02:09,264
Rom... just tell me
who it is.

51
00:02:09,304 --> 00:02:13,043
Then you can leave, and I
can go back to my brooding.

52
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,816
There's only one person
in my life

53
00:02:14,855 --> 00:02:16,189
who's always been there for me

54
00:02:16,226 --> 00:02:17,925
who's never too busy to listen

55
00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:20,565
who reassures me when I'm scared

56
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,340
comforts me when I'm sad

57
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,284
and who showers me
with endless love

58
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,815
without ever asking anything
in return.

59
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,060
I'd like to meet this person.

60
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:30,161
So would I.

61
00:02:30,205 --> 00:02:31,870
You already know her.

62
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:34,212
And she'll always be
there for you, Brother

63
00:02:34,251 --> 00:02:36,588
with open arms.

64
00:02:54,615 --> 00:02:55,915
Quark?

65
00:02:55,953 --> 00:02:57,480
Mother.

66
00:03:00,635 --> 00:03:03,542
Moogie...

67
00:03:03,578 --> 00:03:06,246
hold me.

68
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:10,917
Of all the Bajoran prophecies

69
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:13,789
I think my favorite
is Horran's Seventh...

70
00:05:13,828 --> 00:05:16,394
The one that starts:
"He will come to the palace

71
00:05:16,436 --> 00:05:18,773
"carrying a chalice..."

72
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,178
"Bearing no malice..."

73
00:05:20,215 --> 00:05:22,347
"Overflowing
with sweet spring wine."

74
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,360
Someone's been studying
the ancient texts.

75
00:05:24,394 --> 00:05:25,557
It's important to Leeta.

76
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:27,628
She wants
a traditional Bajoran wedding.

77
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:28,868
And you've agreed to it?

78
00:05:29,745 --> 00:05:31,444
Oh, that's very sweet, Rom.

79
00:05:31,484 --> 00:05:33,388
Is she doing the same for you?

80
00:05:33,423 --> 00:05:35,989
I mean, learning
to be a Ferengi woman?

81
00:05:36,032 --> 00:05:38,004
Memorizing
the Rules of Acquisition...

82
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:39,268
Not likely.

83
00:05:39,309 --> 00:05:41,714
No, Leeta's not the type
of woman to quit her job

84
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,810
stop wearing clothes

85
00:05:42,854 --> 00:05:44,655
and never go out
in public again.

86
00:05:44,693 --> 00:05:45,662
That's okay.

87
00:05:45,696 --> 00:05:47,361
I just want her to be happy.

88
00:05:47,402 --> 00:05:49,875
That's a very enlightened
attitude, Rom.

89
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:52,543
Rom is not your traditional
Ferengi male.

90
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,785
I... guess not.

91
00:05:54,825 --> 00:05:57,527
You're probably the least
Ferengi-like Ferengi

92
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:58,536
I've ever met.

93
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,542
I... guess so.

94
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:03,016
Oh, that's not a bad thing, Rom.

95
00:06:03,085 --> 00:06:05,149
No traditional Ferengi male

96
00:06:05,192 --> 00:06:08,658
could ever marry a
non-Ferengi and be happy.

97
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,175
Well, he could never trust her.

98
00:06:17,798 --> 00:06:20,294
So you see, Moogie, the voles
aren't the real problem.

99
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,971
They're just a symbol
for everything else

100
00:06:22,012 --> 00:06:23,346
that's gone wrong in my life.

101
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,014
You've had a tough year, Quark.

102
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:26,491
That's an understatement.

103
00:06:26,526 --> 00:06:28,521
I see all these great
opportunities out there

104
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:30,093
and I can't do anything
about them.

105
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:32,702
Without a Ferengi
business license

106
00:06:32,746 --> 00:06:35,242
it's like I don't exist.

107
00:06:35,288 --> 00:06:37,123
I understand
why you felt the need

108
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:39,497
to escape for a while,
but why come here?

109
00:06:39,534 --> 00:06:41,472
I had no place else to go.

110
00:06:41,507 --> 00:06:43,342
Are you sure about that?

111
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:45,614
Oh, now, don't
give me that look.

112
00:06:45,653 --> 00:06:48,788
You and I both know
we've never really gotten along.

113
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,962
You disapprove of me, Quark.

114
00:06:51,004 --> 00:06:52,304
You always have.

115
00:06:52,342 --> 00:06:54,406
"Moogie, stop wearing clothes."

116
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:56,353
"Moogie, stop earning profit."

117
00:06:56,388 --> 00:06:57,824
You have stopped, haven't you?

118
00:06:57,859 --> 00:06:59,193
I mean, earning profit.

119
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,963
Wearing clothes is bad enough,
but profit...

120
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,804
You see what I mean?

121
00:07:02,842 --> 00:07:05,315
I know the two of us
living under the same roof

122
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,823
isn't going to be easy,
but you're my mother...

123
00:07:07,858 --> 00:07:09,260
and I love you.

124
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:12,135
And I love you, too, Quark.

125
00:07:12,172 --> 00:07:15,113
But when you say
"living together"

126
00:07:15,148 --> 00:07:16,915
what are we talking about...

127
00:07:16,954 --> 00:07:18,390
a day, a week?

128
00:07:18,425 --> 00:07:19,725
Two weeks?

129
00:07:19,762 --> 00:07:21,289
I don't know.

130
00:07:21,335 --> 00:07:23,672
I guess
until I start feeling better...

131
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,374
unless, of course,
you don't want me.

132
00:07:25,414 --> 00:07:27,717
You're my son.

133
00:07:27,755 --> 00:07:29,853
How could I refuse you?

134
00:07:29,896 --> 00:07:32,369
Then you'll remove
all that unnecessary clothing?

135
00:07:32,403 --> 00:07:34,774
Don't push your luck.

136
00:07:37,552 --> 00:07:39,079
Where are you going?

137
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,097
To my room.
I'm exhausted.

138
00:07:41,131 --> 00:07:44,597
What you need is some
of your mother's cooking...

139
00:07:44,642 --> 00:07:46,740
some nice, juicy tube grubs.

140
00:07:46,783 --> 00:07:48,983
I never liked your tube grubs.

141
00:07:49,023 --> 00:07:51,292
I'll pre-chew them for you.

142
00:07:51,364 --> 00:07:52,800
Maybe later.

143
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:02,822
Hello, room.

144
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:07,208
Where's all my stuff?

145
00:08:07,248 --> 00:08:11,523
If she's thrown out
my Marauder Mo action figures...

146
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:22,690
Grand Nagus?

147
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:24,829
Quark, what are you doing here?

148
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,343
Uh... I'm visiting my mother.

149
00:08:27,446 --> 00:08:28,677
That's no excuse!

150
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,053
You've been banned by the FCA.

151
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:33,587
You must leave
Ferenginar at once!

152
00:08:35,104 --> 00:08:36,232
Got to go.

153
00:08:36,273 --> 00:08:38,746
The Nagus, he knows I'm here.

154
00:08:38,782 --> 00:08:40,252
Wait a minute.

155
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:44,094
What's the Nagus doing
in my closet?

156
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:45,227
The Nagus?

157
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:46,900
Moogie?

158
00:08:48,145 --> 00:08:49,342
Zekkie!

159
00:08:49,382 --> 00:08:51,514
You might as well come out!

160
00:08:51,556 --> 00:08:52,525
"Zekkie"?

161
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,029
What's going on?

162
00:08:54,063 --> 00:08:55,431
The next time you visit

163
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:59,207
I'd really appreciate it
if you called first.

164
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,547
That doesn't answer my question.

165
00:09:01,821 --> 00:09:07,066
"Sometimes the only thing
more dangerous than a question

166
00:09:07,105 --> 00:09:09,544
is an answer."

167
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,811
Rule of Acquisition 208.

168
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,549
You're in trouble
again, aren't you?

169
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,787
What have you done now?

170
00:09:13,827 --> 00:09:15,765
Whatever it is, I had
nothing to do with it.

171
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,769
Tell him, Moogie.

172
00:09:16,803 --> 00:09:17,931
Tell him I'm innocent.

173
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,881
Relax, Quark.
I'm not in any trouble.

174
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:21,885
You're not?

175
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,257
Why would she be in trouble?

176
00:09:24,294 --> 00:09:25,559
I don't know.

177
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:28,334
I-I-I just thought,
since you're here...

178
00:09:28,374 --> 00:09:31,840
Uh... I don't...
I don't know what I thought.

179
00:09:31,884 --> 00:09:33,320
I'm so confused.

180
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:35,089
About what?

181
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:38,595
It's all really quite simple.

182
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:41,512
You see, Quark, uh...

183
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:44,183
your mother and I, uh...

184
00:09:44,223 --> 00:09:46,492
are in love.

185
00:09:57,099 --> 00:09:59,938
How did you two... meet?

186
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:03,577
We met at the global
<i>tongo</i> championships.

187
00:10:03,619 --> 00:10:04,679
That's right.

188
00:10:04,722 --> 00:10:07,857
I was playing in the Golden
Masters Division.

189
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,199
And I was tucked away

190
00:10:09,237 --> 00:10:12,543
in the subbasement playing
in the Female Division.

191
00:10:12,581 --> 00:10:16,856
Anyway, word leaked down to us
that the Grand Nagus was having

192
00:10:16,895 --> 00:10:19,334
a little difficulty
with his game.

193
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,738
Well, for some reason

194
00:10:20,774 --> 00:10:24,548
my purchases
kept exceeding my sales.

195
00:10:24,586 --> 00:10:26,786
So I wrote him a note

196
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:31,068
offering some helpful pointers
on how to firm up his game.

197
00:10:31,106 --> 00:10:32,576
And they worked.

198
00:10:32,612 --> 00:10:34,048
I made a spectacular comeback

199
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,686
and won the tournament
for the 27th year in a row.

200
00:10:37,795 --> 00:10:41,797
Zekkie sent me a very nice
"thank you" note.

201
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,680
Before I knew it, we were
corresponding regularly.

202
00:10:44,717 --> 00:10:48,958
Your mother's letters became
the highlight of each day.

203
00:10:48,998 --> 00:10:50,867
It was clear we had to meet.

204
00:10:50,904 --> 00:10:54,473
Imagine his surprise
when he found out I was a female

205
00:10:54,515 --> 00:10:57,855
and your mother, no less.

206
00:10:57,892 --> 00:11:00,263
I almost had a stroke

207
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,900
but, uh... I recovered.

208
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:05,644
And we've been seeing
each other ever since.

209
00:11:08,092 --> 00:11:10,087
Does anyone know about this?

210
00:11:10,131 --> 00:11:11,727
Of course, no one knows

211
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,438
and you're going
to keep it that way.

212
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:15,539
My lips are sealed.

213
00:11:15,582 --> 00:11:17,143
They'd better be.

214
00:11:17,188 --> 00:11:20,289
Oh, jellied gree worms.

215
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,032
Maihar'du, you are
too good to me.

216
00:11:23,072 --> 00:11:25,774
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

217
00:11:25,814 --> 00:11:28,219
He treats me like a queen.

218
00:11:28,256 --> 00:11:31,494
That's because
you deserve no less.

219
00:11:32,837 --> 00:11:36,782
Zekkie, they don't come
any sweeter than you.

220
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:39,357
I don't believe it.

221
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,827
What's that, Quark?

222
00:11:40,863 --> 00:11:42,835
Uh, nothing.

223
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,708
I've never seen you
looking happier.

224
00:11:45,745 --> 00:11:49,553
That's because
I've never felt happier.

225
00:11:51,664 --> 00:11:52,998
Well, my dear

226
00:11:53,035 --> 00:11:55,669
time to get back
to running the Empire.

227
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,876
Try not to miss me too much.

228
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,548
I miss you already.

229
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,654
That's my girl.

230
00:12:04,906 --> 00:12:07,472
Oh, Lobekins...

231
00:12:07,515 --> 00:12:09,954
don't forget
your appointment calendar.

232
00:12:10,993 --> 00:12:12,965
Thank you, my prize.

233
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:18,004
Your mother
is a rare jewel, Quark.

234
00:12:18,048 --> 00:12:20,385
Worship her...

235
00:12:20,422 --> 00:12:21,413
as I do.

236
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,430
Incredible.

237
00:12:33,464 --> 00:12:34,798
Quark...

238
00:12:34,835 --> 00:12:37,331
if you're going to give me
a hard time about this...

239
00:12:37,377 --> 00:12:40,821
Give you a hard time?

240
00:12:40,854 --> 00:12:42,952
You and the Nagus?

241
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,834
I couldn't be happier...

242
00:12:47,008 --> 00:12:48,980
for all of us.

243
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,704
No sign of a single vole.

244
00:12:58,747 --> 00:13:00,982
I think we got them all.

245
00:13:01,021 --> 00:13:03,494
Chief, is it all right
if I take

246
00:13:03,563 --> 00:13:05,296
a slightly longer
lunch than usual?

247
00:13:05,336 --> 00:13:06,636
I need Leeta to sign this.

248
00:13:06,673 --> 00:13:10,117
The Waiver of Property
and Profit.

249
00:13:10,151 --> 00:13:13,491
Ferengi females aren't allowed
to own property or earn profit.

250
00:13:13,528 --> 00:13:14,862
The WP&P states

251
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:16,530
that, in the event
the marriage ends

252
00:13:16,638 --> 00:13:19,876
the female gives up all claim
to her husband's estate.

253
00:13:19,915 --> 00:13:22,047
And you expect Leeta
to agree to this?

254
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:24,562
I agreed to wear the earring.

255
00:13:24,663 --> 00:13:27,570
So either Leeta signs this
or the wedding's off.

256
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,374
I may not be
a traditional Ferengi

257
00:13:29,413 --> 00:13:30,678
but I'm still a Ferengi.

258
00:13:30,717 --> 00:13:31,708
It's your life

259
00:13:31,753 --> 00:13:33,384
but I think you're making
a big mistake.

260
00:13:33,426 --> 00:13:37,268
I think I'd be making
a bigger mistake if I didn't.

261
00:13:37,304 --> 00:13:39,071
Besides, Leeta loves me.

262
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,603
You'll see, Chief.

263
00:13:40,648 --> 00:13:42,050
She'll sign it.

264
00:13:42,086 --> 00:13:44,024
Are you crazy?

265
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:45,620
I'm not going to sign this.

266
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:47,031
Why not?

267
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:50,307
Because a marriage is
about sharing everything

268
00:13:50,346 --> 00:13:51,816
including money.

269
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:53,412
Not on Ferenginar.

270
00:13:53,456 --> 00:13:55,759
We're not on Ferenginar.

271
00:13:55,797 --> 00:13:57,267
But I'm a Ferengi.

272
00:13:57,301 --> 00:13:58,601
And I'm not.

273
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,273
"Females and finances
don't mix."

274
00:14:01,314 --> 00:14:03,343
Rule of Acquisition 94.

275
00:14:03,387 --> 00:14:05,256
That's a stupid rule.

276
00:14:06,798 --> 00:14:08,098
It's true.

277
00:14:08,136 --> 00:14:09,606
You're just like her.

278
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,272
You're after my money.

279
00:14:11,313 --> 00:14:12,647
Like who?

280
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,051
My first wife...

281
00:14:14,088 --> 00:14:15,615
pretending
that you care about me

282
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,153
but, all the time,
it's my profits

283
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:18,463
that you really care about.

284
00:14:18,503 --> 00:14:20,669
Rom...

285
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:23,913
I love you...

286
00:14:23,954 --> 00:14:25,515
not your latinum.

287
00:14:25,558 --> 00:14:26,686
Then prove it.

288
00:14:26,796 --> 00:14:28,894
Sign the WP&P.

289
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:29,926
Never.

290
00:14:29,973 --> 00:14:32,071
Then the marriage is off.

291
00:14:32,112 --> 00:14:33,446
You bet it is.

292
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:41,070
My dear, you reek of tube grubs.

293
00:14:42,111 --> 00:14:43,239
So do you, Lobekins.

294
00:14:43,281 --> 00:14:45,014
Are your ears tingling?

295
00:14:45,054 --> 00:14:46,753
Mine, too.

296
00:14:47,796 --> 00:14:49,631
So tell me, Nagus...

297
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:51,300
how was your day?

298
00:14:51,341 --> 00:14:53,405
Oh, you know how it is.

299
00:14:53,447 --> 00:14:56,183
Arcybite ore futures
are continuing to increase

300
00:14:56,222 --> 00:14:58,320
and the Bolians
have finally agreed

301
00:14:58,363 --> 00:15:00,495
to allow the Ferengi
Gaming Commission to take over

302
00:15:00,537 --> 00:15:02,270
all their gambling emporiums.

303
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:04,304
And... and...

304
00:15:04,348 --> 00:15:06,343
Huh? Mm... Oh!

305
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:10,494
I have decided to allocate
extra funds for research

306
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:13,237
on a new breed
of Hupyrian beetles.

307
00:15:13,277 --> 00:15:16,914
Those little fellows
are going to revolutionize

308
00:15:16,956 --> 00:15:19,658
the entire beetle snuff
industry.

309
00:15:19,698 --> 00:15:22,571
Now that's what I call
a busy and productive day.

310
00:15:22,607 --> 00:15:26,916
No wonder the Ferengi economy
is growing at a record pace.

311
00:15:26,954 --> 00:15:29,120
Costs are down,
profits are up...

312
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:33,107
And opportunity is
around every corner.

313
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,375
Zekkie, you've done quite a job.

314
00:15:35,414 --> 00:15:37,283
And your people love you
for it...

315
00:15:37,321 --> 00:15:39,852
your business acumen,
your negotiation skills

316
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:42,996
your kindness and generosity.

317
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,008
Forget it, Quark.

318
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:46,174
I'm not going to reverse
the FCA's decision.

319
00:15:46,216 --> 00:15:48,451
They revoked
your business license

320
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,985
and they're the ones who are
going to have to reinstate it.

321
00:15:51,031 --> 00:15:53,665
But you're the most powerful man
on Ferenginar.

322
00:15:53,707 --> 00:15:56,044
You can do whatever you want.

323
00:15:56,081 --> 00:16:00,151
True, but contracts are
the very basis of our society

324
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:03,729
and you broke a contract
with another Ferengi.

325
00:16:03,772 --> 00:16:06,611
If I were to intervene
on your behalf

326
00:16:06,648 --> 00:16:10,251
I would be encouraging others
to violate the law!

327
00:16:10,293 --> 00:16:12,265
And that I will not do!

328
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:13,998
Moogie...

329
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:15,771
talk to him.

330
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,908
He makes a very good point,
Quark.

331
00:16:17,951 --> 00:16:19,421
What you did was wrong.

332
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,621
Thanks.
I knew I could count on you.

333
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:25,204
And I'd watch my tone
of voice if I were you.

334
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,120
Well, my dear, shall we
take a stroll in your garden?

335
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,356
Oh, and, Quark,
will you do me a favor?

336
00:16:32,396 --> 00:16:34,265
Help Maihar'du clear the table.

337
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,640
He's not as young
as he used to be.

338
00:16:58,915 --> 00:17:01,754
Brunt, FCA.

339
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:09,378
What are you doing
in my closet?!

340
00:17:09,415 --> 00:17:12,185
Conducting official
FCA business.

341
00:17:12,224 --> 00:17:13,820
In my closet?

342
00:17:13,863 --> 00:17:16,302
I didn't want the "happy couple"
to see me.

343
00:17:16,337 --> 00:17:17,830
Happy couple?

344
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:21,283
Oh, don't play innocent with me.

345
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:27,830
I know all about their
perverted little love affair.

346
00:17:27,874 --> 00:17:29,242
I had nothing to do with it.

347
00:17:29,278 --> 00:17:30,475
They met playing <i>tongo.</i>

348
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,511
I only found out about it today.

349
00:17:32,556 --> 00:17:34,893
She's your mother, Quark

350
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,028
and that makes you responsible.

351
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,939
And right now, she's endangering

352
00:17:38,977 --> 00:17:42,477
the very foundation
of Ferengi society.

353
00:17:44,026 --> 00:17:46,933
I can see her now,
whispering in the Nagus' ear

354
00:17:46,968 --> 00:17:49,032
contaminating
his very thoughts

355
00:17:49,075 --> 00:17:51,480
with her twisted
female philosophies.

356
00:17:51,516 --> 00:17:52,884
I tell you, Quark...

357
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,416
if we don't put an end
to their relationship

358
00:17:55,462 --> 00:17:57,400
you're going to see
clothed females

359
00:17:57,435 --> 00:17:59,567
walking down the streets
of Ferenginar

360
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:01,102
in broad daylight.

361
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:02,515
If I had my way

362
00:18:02,551 --> 00:18:05,755
I'd climb to the top
of the Tower of Commerce

363
00:18:05,796 --> 00:18:09,170
and denounce your mother
to the crowd below

364
00:18:09,273 --> 00:18:16,354
but... we must spare the Nagus
even a hint of public disgrace.

365
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:20,033
We've got to put an end
to their relationship but...

366
00:18:20,074 --> 00:18:21,408
privately.

367
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,211
Quietly.

368
00:18:24,321 --> 00:18:26,122
So, what are you going to do?

369
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,825
I'm not going to do anything.

370
00:18:27,866 --> 00:18:28,994
You are.

371
00:18:29,036 --> 00:18:30,005
Me?

372
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:31,167
Who else?

373
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:33,341
She's your mother,
and the Nagus...

374
00:18:33,383 --> 00:18:35,720
for reasons that
elude me completely...

375
00:18:35,757 --> 00:18:37,022
likes you.

376
00:18:37,061 --> 00:18:40,196
You're in the perfect position
to poison their relationship.

377
00:18:40,238 --> 00:18:43,943
Why should I help you?

378
00:18:43,983 --> 00:18:46,719
You revoked
my business license.

379
00:18:48,431 --> 00:18:50,734
I'll give you a new one.

380
00:18:50,772 --> 00:18:53,007
You've got a deal.

381
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:02,097
Once again, O Nagus,
you have proven

382
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:07,283
that you have the wisest lobes
in all of Ferenginar.

383
00:19:07,325 --> 00:19:10,027
That's what they pay me for, eh?

384
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:32,801
I need to speak to the Nagus.

385
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,831
It's a personal matter...

386
00:19:33,876 --> 00:19:35,210
nothing for you to worry about.

387
00:19:35,247 --> 00:19:36,615
What do you want, Quark?

388
00:19:36,652 --> 00:19:38,818
I just dropped by
to pay my respects.

389
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:40,524
Well, in that case, pay them.

390
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:42,795
Oh.

391
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:47,719
Feel better?

392
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:48,882
Now go.

393
00:19:48,924 --> 00:19:50,052
Before I do

394
00:19:50,094 --> 00:19:51,564
I just want to say
how proud I am

395
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,576
that you consider my home
your home.

396
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:57,345
My mother is a very lucky woman.

397
00:19:57,384 --> 00:19:59,083
And I am a very lucky man.

398
00:19:59,123 --> 00:20:01,689
I guess the only one around here

399
00:20:01,732 --> 00:20:03,796
who isn't lucky is you, Quark.

400
00:20:05,845 --> 00:20:09,289
I just think it's great
that she's found someone

401
00:20:09,323 --> 00:20:12,629
who cares for her so deeply
that he can ignore

402
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:15,163
all those vicious rumors
about her.

403
00:20:15,209 --> 00:20:19,017
Oh, you mean the rumors
about her earning profit?

404
00:20:19,054 --> 00:20:20,958
I know that whole story.

405
00:20:20,993 --> 00:20:23,057
The FCA made her give up

406
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,935
every strip of latinum
she made.

407
00:20:26,144 --> 00:20:27,546
I'm talking about
the other rumors.

408
00:20:27,581 --> 00:20:29,816
The ones that say that she
hasn't given it all back.

409
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:31,291
Oh, nonsense.

410
00:20:31,326 --> 00:20:35,396
Of course, it is,
and the wildest rumor has to be

411
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:37,240
what she plans to do
with her fortune...

412
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:39,217
that she's going to fund
a political revolution

413
00:20:39,251 --> 00:20:41,987
to end the male domination
on Ferenginar.

414
00:20:42,027 --> 00:20:43,588
You mean...

415
00:20:43,632 --> 00:20:46,573
equal rights for females?

416
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:48,707
It's crazy, isn't it?

417
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:52,351
I mean, so what
if she wears clothing

418
00:20:52,393 --> 00:20:54,388
or that she's managed
to worm her way into the heart

419
00:20:54,434 --> 00:20:56,532
of the most influential
Ferengi alive.

420
00:20:56,573 --> 00:20:58,043
Those aren't crimes, are they?

421
00:20:58,079 --> 00:20:59,640
Absolutely not.

422
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:05,029
And what if she's as cunning
and ruthless as any male?

423
00:21:05,067 --> 00:21:08,271
That doesn't mean
that she's not to be trusted...

424
00:21:08,311 --> 00:21:09,439
does it?

425
00:21:10,451 --> 00:21:13,586
The important thing is
that she loves you

426
00:21:13,628 --> 00:21:15,327
and that you're not some pawn

427
00:21:15,367 --> 00:21:17,362
in her plans
for world domination.

428
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:19,778
World domination?

429
00:21:19,814 --> 00:21:21,479
By a female?!

430
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,792
It's a horrifying thought.

431
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,396
Luckily, they're just rumors.

432
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:29,411
Rumors.

433
00:21:29,446 --> 00:21:32,445
Well, time to go.

434
00:21:32,488 --> 00:21:34,187
I'll see you tonight, Nagus.

435
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:35,823
I know Moogie can hardly wait.

436
00:21:35,866 --> 00:21:37,029
For what?

437
00:21:38,307 --> 00:21:40,006
For you to get home.

438
00:21:43,591 --> 00:21:46,293
Now that he mentions it

439
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:49,434
she really has no business
wearing clothes

440
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:52,076
i-in front of her Nagus.

441
00:22:00,411 --> 00:22:01,881
I should start dinner.

442
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,477
Zekkie'll be here any minute.

443
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,461
What do you say
to some nice slug steaks?

444
00:22:06,497 --> 00:22:08,332
I'm not hungry.

445
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,273
Quark, the power cells
are empty.

446
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:13,376
I must have been
too depressed to notice.

447
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:15,391
It's the FCA ban, isn't it?

448
00:22:15,425 --> 00:22:16,485
It's awful.

449
00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:17,760
You don't know what it's like

450
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,737
to be denied the opportunity
to earn profit.

451
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,003
Oh, yes, I do.

452
00:22:21,043 --> 00:22:22,137
I know exactly what it's like.

453
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,776
It's worse for a male.

454
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:24,786
Is it?

455
00:22:24,889 --> 00:22:26,382
Moogie...

456
00:22:26,427 --> 00:22:28,023
I'm...

457
00:22:28,065 --> 00:22:31,565
in no mood to argue
politics right now.

458
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,080
I'm too distressed.

459
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,023
All right, Quark.

460
00:22:36,058 --> 00:22:37,528
I'll talk to the Nagus.

461
00:22:37,563 --> 00:22:39,661
I'll see if I can
convince him

462
00:22:39,703 --> 00:22:41,538
to intercede on your behalf.

463
00:22:41,576 --> 00:22:44,346
Oh, Moogie.

464
00:22:44,384 --> 00:22:48,123
You're a manipulative,
self-centered conniver.

465
00:22:48,163 --> 00:22:49,463
Thank you.

466
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,131
Now, Zek'll be here any minute.

467
00:22:51,173 --> 00:22:52,473
I'll make myself scarce.

468
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,810
Good luck.

469
00:22:53,848 --> 00:22:55,683
I'm counting on you.

470
00:23:06,421 --> 00:23:08,860
Commander, I'm sorry
if the Klingons are unhappy

471
00:23:08,896 --> 00:23:10,629
but station rules
are station rules.

472
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:12,470
I am well aware of station rules

473
00:23:12,508 --> 00:23:14,480
but General Martok
is a great warrior.

474
00:23:14,514 --> 00:23:16,885
And he has no business
being in a holding cell.

475
00:23:16,955 --> 00:23:18,756
He threw one of his men
off that crossway.

476
00:23:18,795 --> 00:23:20,231
That was
a disciplinary measure.

477
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:21,235
Oh.

478
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:22,500
Besides, K'retok
was not injured.

479
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,566
He was barely shaken up.

480
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:25,136
As opposed
to the Bolian Ambassador.

481
00:23:25,182 --> 00:23:26,915
K'retok only missed her
by a centimeter.

482
00:23:26,987 --> 00:23:28,321
But he did miss her.

483
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:30,925
Constable...
release General Martok.

484
00:23:30,966 --> 00:23:31,935
Sir...

485
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,338
Mr. Worf, tell the General

486
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:35,541
that this is not
a Klingon space station.

487
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,108
If he can't abide
by the regulations

488
00:23:37,153 --> 00:23:40,323
I'm sure Chancellor Gowron
will send us someone who can.

489
00:23:40,363 --> 00:23:42,495
Understood.

490
00:23:42,537 --> 00:23:43,528
Constable?

491
00:23:43,573 --> 00:23:44,599
Understood.

492
00:23:46,081 --> 00:23:47,381
Do you hear that?

493
00:23:57,076 --> 00:23:58,204
Rom?

494
00:23:58,246 --> 00:23:59,716
Are you all right?

495
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,050
I'm fine Captain.

496
00:24:01,088 --> 00:24:02,558
Thanks for asking.

497
00:24:04,098 --> 00:24:06,834
The wedding is off.

498
00:24:06,873 --> 00:24:07,864
I'm sorry.

499
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,745
Don't be, Captain.

500
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:12,759
These are tears of joy.

501
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,534
Carry on.

502
00:24:22,657 --> 00:24:23,626
I hate him.

503
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,629
No, you don't.

504
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:25,791
All he loves is latinum.

505
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:26,803
No, he doesn't.

506
00:24:26,837 --> 00:24:28,536
Canceling that wedding
was the best thing

507
00:24:28,576 --> 00:24:29,670
that ever happened to me.

508
00:24:29,713 --> 00:24:30,682
No, it isn't.

509
00:24:30,716 --> 00:24:33,155
I am so glad
he's out of my life.

510
00:24:33,191 --> 00:24:34,160
No, you're not.

511
00:24:34,194 --> 00:24:36,394
Major... you haven't
been listening to me.

512
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:37,995
Yes, I have.

513
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,377
It's how I know you love him.

514
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,901
Moogie! I'm home!

515
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,252
So, how'd it go?

516
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,851
Am I reinstated?

517
00:25:07,233 --> 00:25:08,202
What's wrong?

518
00:25:08,236 --> 00:25:09,867
Did the Nagus say no?

519
00:25:11,078 --> 00:25:14,418
Don't you think about
anyone but yourself?

520
00:25:14,455 --> 00:25:15,755
Of course, I do.

521
00:25:15,793 --> 00:25:18,096
I just think
about myself first.

522
00:25:18,135 --> 00:25:20,199
Now tell me, what's wrong?

523
00:25:20,241 --> 00:25:22,646
He left me.

524
00:25:22,749 --> 00:25:26,021
All I asked him was to
reinstate your license

525
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:28,932
and the next thing I
know, he's accusing me

526
00:25:28,968 --> 00:25:30,769
of plotting to overthrow
the government.

527
00:25:30,808 --> 00:25:31,868
That's ridiculous.

528
00:25:31,912 --> 00:25:33,679
He said I didn't
really love him

529
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:35,449
that I was just using him

530
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:39,264
that I was a scheming,
profit-hungry female

531
00:25:39,302 --> 00:25:41,331
who couldn't keep
her clothes off.

532
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:42,469
The nerve.

533
00:25:42,512 --> 00:25:43,709
Oh, Quark...

534
00:25:43,816 --> 00:25:46,085
I don't know what I'm
going to do without him.

535
00:25:46,123 --> 00:25:50,068
I don't know what he's
going to do without me.

536
00:25:50,103 --> 00:25:53,307
Moogie, I'm sorry,
but these things happen.

537
00:25:53,347 --> 00:25:56,813
It's probably better this way.

538
00:25:57,895 --> 00:25:59,365
No, it isn't.

539
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:00,995
It's a disaster...

540
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:02,372
for all of us.

541
00:26:13,578 --> 00:26:14,638
Brunt, FCA.

542
00:26:14,682 --> 00:26:17,019
I hope you've had
a productive day.

543
00:26:17,056 --> 00:26:18,891
I certainly have.

544
00:26:18,928 --> 00:26:20,593
You're smiling, Quark.

545
00:26:20,634 --> 00:26:22,937
Therefore, I assume
your mother is not.

546
00:26:22,975 --> 00:26:25,711
It's hard to smile
when you have a broken heart.

547
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,783
Now, about
my business license...

548
00:26:28,827 --> 00:26:31,495
As of this moment,
it's as valid as my own.

549
00:26:31,535 --> 00:26:33,028
Congratulations, Quark.

550
00:26:33,073 --> 00:26:35,137
You're a Ferengi again.

551
00:26:35,849 --> 00:26:38,950
I always was.

552
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,531
Breakfast.

553
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,766
I'm not hungry.

554
00:26:53,807 --> 00:26:55,973
Moogie, you have
to eat something.

555
00:26:56,013 --> 00:26:57,347
Why?

556
00:26:57,384 --> 00:26:58,877
Because... life goes on.

557
00:26:58,989 --> 00:27:01,155
There are other slugs
in the sea.

558
00:27:02,266 --> 00:27:03,827
You're leaving, aren't you?

559
00:27:03,905 --> 00:27:05,809
You're going back
to Deep Space 9.

560
00:27:05,845 --> 00:27:07,145
How did you know that?

561
00:27:07,182 --> 00:27:09,211
You spent all morning
jellying gree worms

562
00:27:09,255 --> 00:27:11,957
which tells me that your
conscience is bothering you.

563
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:14,871
You feel guilty
about leaving me alone.

564
00:27:14,907 --> 00:27:16,845
Well, don't.
I don't need you.

565
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,818
I don't need anyone.

566
00:27:18,853 --> 00:27:21,292
Okay.
Then, I'll go pack.

567
00:27:23,535 --> 00:27:25,530
Who could that be?

568
00:27:27,548 --> 00:27:29,018
Hello, Rom.

569
00:27:29,052 --> 00:27:30,078
It's Quark.

570
00:27:30,122 --> 00:27:31,592
Quark... that's what I said.

571
00:27:31,627 --> 00:27:34,397
I want to see you in the Tower
of Commerce right away.

572
00:27:34,436 --> 00:27:35,804
Don't keep me waiting.

573
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,942
Why is the Nagus calling you?

574
00:27:38,984 --> 00:27:40,511
I have no idea.

575
00:27:40,555 --> 00:27:42,356
I bet it's about me.

576
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:43,728
I doubt it.

577
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:46,136
But then... it could be.

578
00:27:46,174 --> 00:27:48,409
Either way,
I'll do all I can

579
00:27:48,448 --> 00:27:51,184
to straighten things out
between the two of you.

580
00:27:51,223 --> 00:27:52,591
That's a promise.

581
00:27:56,171 --> 00:27:59,945
You want me to be
First Clerk to the Nagus?

582
00:27:59,984 --> 00:28:01,215
That's right, Quark...

583
00:28:01,255 --> 00:28:03,193
my own personal
financial assistant.

584
00:28:03,228 --> 00:28:04,528
What do you say?

585
00:28:04,565 --> 00:28:05,693
Why me?

586
00:28:05,735 --> 00:28:08,574
Consider it a reward
for saving me

587
00:28:08,612 --> 00:28:10,847
from that wretched
mother of yours.

588
00:28:10,886 --> 00:28:12,585
What about my bar?

589
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:15,098
Do you want to be a bartender
all your life?

590
00:28:15,132 --> 00:28:16,967
I'm offering you
something more...

591
00:28:17,005 --> 00:28:19,707
the chance to participate
in the major decisions

592
00:28:19,747 --> 00:28:22,586
that shape this glorious
financial empire of ours.

593
00:28:22,623 --> 00:28:24,926
Well, when you
put it that way...

594
00:28:24,964 --> 00:28:26,560
Good. Then you can begin

595
00:28:26,602 --> 00:28:29,075
by briefing me
on today's petitioners.

596
00:28:32,521 --> 00:28:35,291
I need your access code.

597
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:38,066
3-7-4 slash 1-5-5.

598
00:28:38,106 --> 00:28:39,234
It's not working.

599
00:28:39,276 --> 00:28:42,947
You must have put them in wrong.

600
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:44,926
3-7-4 slash 1-5-5.

601
00:28:44,961 --> 00:28:46,295
Nope.

602
00:28:46,332 --> 00:28:48,932
Maybe it's 1-5-4.

603
00:28:51,382 --> 00:28:53,377
No, that isn't it either.

604
00:28:53,421 --> 00:28:55,690
But I don't understand.

605
00:28:55,728 --> 00:28:59,536
What did I say
those first numbers were?

606
00:28:59,575 --> 00:29:01,068
3-7-4.

607
00:29:01,113 --> 00:29:03,085
Three, seven, four?

608
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:04,750
Are those right?

609
00:29:04,791 --> 00:29:06,889
You're confusing me!

610
00:29:06,931 --> 00:29:08,333
I-I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

611
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,259
Oh! It was a six.

612
00:29:16,294 --> 00:29:18,095
What was?

613
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:19,535
The last number.

614
00:29:19,572 --> 00:29:21,875
Well, isn't that
what I just said?!

615
00:29:21,913 --> 00:29:23,474
A lifetime of numbers...

616
00:29:23,517 --> 00:29:25,888
you can't blame me
for forgetting a few.

617
00:29:27,095 --> 00:29:28,656
Let's get down to business.

618
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:30,262
Who's the first petitioner?

619
00:29:30,306 --> 00:29:32,335
Um...

620
00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:33,747
DaiMon Igel.

621
00:29:33,784 --> 00:29:35,152
He wants to know

622
00:29:35,188 --> 00:29:37,423
whether he should sell
his duranium interests

623
00:29:37,462 --> 00:29:39,935
on the open market
or on the Futures Exchange.

624
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,942
An interesting question.

625
00:29:45,588 --> 00:29:47,219
Well, don't just stand there!

626
00:29:47,293 --> 00:29:49,459
Let's see
how duranium's been doing.

627
00:29:51,908 --> 00:29:54,245
Over the last three
trading cycles

628
00:29:54,316 --> 00:29:57,987
there's been an increase
of seven and three-quarters

629
00:29:58,028 --> 00:30:01,733
a decrease of two and an eighth,
and another increase

630
00:30:01,773 --> 00:30:03,438
of 11 and three-eighths.

631
00:30:03,478 --> 00:30:05,713
Oh. That's a gain of 18 points.

632
00:30:05,752 --> 00:30:07,884
Actually, that's 17.

633
00:30:07,926 --> 00:30:09,659
What are you talking about?!

634
00:30:09,699 --> 00:30:11,192
Seven and three-quarters

635
00:30:11,236 --> 00:30:13,972
minus two and one-ninth

636
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:15,745
is seven...

637
00:30:15,784 --> 00:30:18,657
Oh, who cares
about duranium anyway?

638
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:20,324
DaiMon Igel.

639
00:30:20,432 --> 00:30:22,496
DaiMon Igel? Who's he?

640
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:24,944
Do I like him?

641
00:30:35,748 --> 00:30:38,085
Come in.

642
00:30:38,122 --> 00:30:39,285
Hello, Chief.

643
00:30:39,326 --> 00:30:42,700
I need that phase calibrator
I leant you the other day.

644
00:30:42,737 --> 00:30:44,766
It's in my tool kit
by the door.

645
00:30:44,811 --> 00:30:46,338
Rom, what are you doing?

646
00:30:46,382 --> 00:30:49,882
These are my profits, Chief...
my entire fortune.

647
00:30:49,927 --> 00:30:52,127
It may be small, but it's mine.

648
00:30:53,638 --> 00:30:55,439
Why the two piles?

649
00:30:55,511 --> 00:30:58,042
I'm thinking of giving
this pile to Leeta.

650
00:30:58,086 --> 00:31:00,788
That way, maybe she'll
sign the WP&P.

651
00:31:00,828 --> 00:31:02,389
You're offering her a bribe?

652
00:31:02,501 --> 00:31:04,234
Bribes can be very effective.

653
00:31:04,272 --> 00:31:07,544
But if she signs the waiver,
then she can't own anything

654
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:10,149
so, she'll have to give
it all back to you.

655
00:31:10,191 --> 00:31:11,593
Right.

656
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,933
That's not going to work, is it?

657
00:31:15,508 --> 00:31:17,412
Rom, I don't think
there's any way

658
00:31:17,447 --> 00:31:20,423
you're going to convince
Leeta to sign that waiver.

659
00:31:20,457 --> 00:31:22,258
Have you ever looked
at latinum?

660
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,030
I mean, really looked at it?

661
00:31:24,069 --> 00:31:26,007
It's so beautiful...

662
00:31:26,042 --> 00:31:28,642
not to mention,
smooth to the touch.

663
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:32,224
Do you want Leeta back or not?

664
00:31:32,262 --> 00:31:34,701
"Latinum lasts longer
than lust."

665
00:31:34,736 --> 00:31:36,503
Rule of Acquisition 229.

666
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:39,381
Maybe, but lust can
be a lot more fun.

667
00:31:39,418 --> 00:31:41,253
Now, answer the question.

668
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:43,457
Do you want her back or not?

669
00:31:43,498 --> 00:31:47,033
I'd give anything
to hold her in my arms again.

670
00:31:50,587 --> 00:31:52,354
Anything?

671
00:32:01,756 --> 00:32:02,263
One <i>jumja</i> stick, please.

672
00:32:02,263 --> 00:32:03,289
One <i>jumja</i> stick, please.

673
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,136
What flavor?

674
00:32:07,178 --> 00:32:08,478
Actually...

675
00:32:08,515 --> 00:32:10,453
I don't like <i>jumja</i> sticks.

676
00:32:10,489 --> 00:32:13,123
Then what do you want, Rom?

677
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:14,999
I want you to marry me.

678
00:32:16,608 --> 00:32:18,637
I'm not signing that waiver.

679
00:32:18,682 --> 00:32:20,483
You don't have to...
not anymore.

680
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:22,892
I don't have
any profit left to protect.

681
00:32:22,962 --> 00:32:24,056
I don't understand.

682
00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:25,364
I gave all my latinum

683
00:32:25,403 --> 00:32:29,040
to Major Kira for the Bajoran
War Orphans Fund.

684
00:32:29,082 --> 00:32:30,883
She kissed me.

685
00:32:31,891 --> 00:32:33,522
Oh, Rom!

686
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:36,931
You did that for me?

687
00:32:37,007 --> 00:32:38,740
I did it for us.

688
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:41,846
Now we have nothing
but our love.

689
00:32:41,889 --> 00:32:44,956
That's all we need.

690
00:32:45,033 --> 00:32:46,059
That...

691
00:32:46,102 --> 00:32:48,906
and my salary from Quark's.

692
00:33:01,585 --> 00:33:02,953
Well done, Chief...

693
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:05,189
or should I call you Cupid?

694
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,895
What can I say?

695
00:33:06,936 --> 00:33:09,375
I'm just
an incurable romantic.

696
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,755
Quark, where have
you been all day?

697
00:33:14,794 --> 00:33:15,957
With the Nagus.

698
00:33:15,998 --> 00:33:17,491
He made me his First Clerk.

699
00:33:17,536 --> 00:33:18,664
I see.

700
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:20,177
Well, then you've
had a miserable day

701
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:21,180
haven't you?

702
00:33:21,214 --> 00:33:22,684
The worst day of my life.

703
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:24,189
How'd you know?

704
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:27,564
The Market Exchange
is down 199 points.

705
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,710
I don't know
if I should tell you this

706
00:33:30,745 --> 00:33:31,805
but I have to tell someone.

707
00:33:31,848 --> 00:33:33,045
The Nagus, he is...

708
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:34,053
I know.

709
00:33:34,122 --> 00:33:36,060
His memory isn't
what it used to be.

710
00:33:36,162 --> 00:33:37,827
Did you try
stroking his lobes?

711
00:33:37,868 --> 00:33:39,669
No, I didn't stroke his lobes.

712
00:33:39,707 --> 00:33:41,007
It helps focus him.

713
00:33:41,045 --> 00:33:44,078
It's also not a bad idea
if you repeat what you say

714
00:33:44,121 --> 00:33:45,386
to him.

715
00:33:45,425 --> 00:33:47,762
Sometimes it takes two,
even three times

716
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:49,395
before he'll retain it.

717
00:33:50,676 --> 00:33:52,648
You two weren't just lovers.

718
00:33:52,682 --> 00:33:54,917
You were helping him run things.

719
00:33:54,955 --> 00:33:58,056
You're the power
behind the throne?

720
00:33:58,099 --> 00:34:00,071
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

721
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:02,841
I just helped him a little...
guided him.

722
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,441
A leveraged buyout here

723
00:34:04,486 --> 00:34:06,458
some momentum investing
there...

724
00:34:06,492 --> 00:34:07,792
Why didn't you tell me?

725
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,806
If I'd known what was going on,
I never would have...

726
00:34:11,976 --> 00:34:13,378
Never would have what?

727
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,320
Oh, Quark.

728
00:34:16,357 --> 00:34:18,626
You turned Zek against me,
didn't you?

729
00:34:18,664 --> 00:34:21,663
You filled his head
with all those lies about me.

730
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:23,577
I didn't know.

731
00:34:23,614 --> 00:34:25,141
Who put you up to this?

732
00:34:25,253 --> 00:34:26,347
Who do you think?

733
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,693
Brunt.

734
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,531
What did he offer you?

735
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,701
Your business license back?

736
00:34:32,743 --> 00:34:35,080
"A Ferengi without profit
is no Ferengi at all."

737
00:34:35,117 --> 00:34:36,417
You taught me that.

738
00:34:36,454 --> 00:34:37,548
The Rules of Acquisition

739
00:34:37,592 --> 00:34:39,188
aren't going to help
you now, Quark.

740
00:34:39,297 --> 00:34:40,893
A 199-point slide.

741
00:34:40,936 --> 00:34:43,068
And that's just the beginning.

742
00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:44,808
Congratulations, Quark.

743
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:48,384
You've not only destroyed
my life and Zek's life

744
00:34:48,426 --> 00:34:51,128
you may have triggered
the destruction

745
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:53,334
of the entire Ferengi economy.

746
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:55,814
I hope it was worth it.

747
00:35:06,891 --> 00:35:09,992
My, aren't we early today.

748
00:35:10,034 --> 00:35:15,712
But I suppose
after yesterday's fiasco...

749
00:35:15,752 --> 00:35:18,693
we have no alternative.

750
00:35:18,728 --> 00:35:23,904
A 199-point plummet!

751
00:35:24,949 --> 00:35:27,982
Haven't seen that steep
a market slide

752
00:35:28,024 --> 00:35:29,928
since Grand Nagus Smeet

753
00:35:29,965 --> 00:35:31,766
and you know
what happened to him?

754
00:35:31,804 --> 00:35:32,773
The only Grand Nagus

755
00:35:32,807 --> 00:35:34,472
to be assassinated
while in office.

756
00:35:34,512 --> 00:35:37,545
What was the name
of his First Clerk?

757
00:35:37,588 --> 00:35:39,993
I believe they buried
them together.

758
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,831
I'm sure we'll do better today.

759
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:43,237
No, you won't.

760
00:35:43,273 --> 00:35:46,944
The Market Exchange
will remain closed today.

761
00:35:46,985 --> 00:35:50,622
The FCA Board of Liquidators
has called

762
00:35:50,664 --> 00:35:53,400
an emergency meeting
with the Grand Nagus.

763
00:35:53,439 --> 00:35:57,144
We have some...
questions to ask him.

764
00:35:57,184 --> 00:35:59,179
And by the time we're through

765
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:01,824
you'll both be out of a job.

766
00:36:01,866 --> 00:36:03,599
Why are you picking on me?

767
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:06,078
I've done everything
you asked, haven't I?

768
00:36:06,113 --> 00:36:07,778
Everything.

769
00:36:09,725 --> 00:36:13,362
Oh...

770
00:36:13,403 --> 00:36:16,504
Grand Nagus...

771
00:36:16,546 --> 00:36:18,177
Brunt.

772
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:19,850
Daddy will be so proud.

773
00:36:21,228 --> 00:36:24,636
You knew the truth about the
Nagus all along, didn't you?

774
00:36:24,672 --> 00:36:26,838
You mean,
about Zek's failing memory?

775
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,715
Let me think.

776
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:30,119
Hmm...

777
00:36:30,157 --> 00:36:33,133
Well, you know,
now that you mention it...

778
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:35,868
yes, I did.

779
00:36:35,908 --> 00:36:37,937
That's why you wanted
to destroy his relationship

780
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:40,113
with my mother,
not to protect him...

781
00:36:40,155 --> 00:36:42,651
but to expose him.

782
00:36:42,696 --> 00:36:44,691
I couldn't have done it
without you.

783
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:47,506
I feel almost... grateful

784
00:36:47,545 --> 00:36:49,882
which is why I'm going
to let you keep

785
00:36:49,919 --> 00:36:51,550
your new business license.

786
00:36:51,592 --> 00:36:55,092
Now, put down those padds,
pack your things

787
00:36:55,136 --> 00:36:58,408
and scurry on back
to that little bar of yours.

788
00:37:01,256 --> 00:37:03,251
So, how come you're still here,
Quark?

789
00:37:03,296 --> 00:37:04,995
After all, Brunt is right.

790
00:37:05,034 --> 00:37:07,405
You should be back
on Deep Space 9

791
00:37:07,442 --> 00:37:09,107
celebrating your victory.

792
00:37:09,147 --> 00:37:11,586
You've proven yourself
a true Ferengi.

793
00:37:11,622 --> 00:37:13,788
You've betrayed friends
and family

794
00:37:13,863 --> 00:37:15,459
for personal gain.

795
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:17,770
It sounds so good
when you say it.

796
00:37:17,808 --> 00:37:19,473
But?

797
00:37:21,253 --> 00:37:25,996
I think I've been hanging around
hu-mans too long.

798
00:37:26,034 --> 00:37:28,702
I think I'm developing a...

799
00:37:28,743 --> 00:37:30,236
Conscience?

800
00:37:32,088 --> 00:37:34,323
It's been coming
for a long time.

801
00:37:34,362 --> 00:37:37,736
I've fought against it,
I really have.

802
00:37:37,772 --> 00:37:41,614
But living with those people
day in and day out

803
00:37:41,651 --> 00:37:44,718
being exposed to their ethics,
their morality...

804
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:48,397
It's like I've been brainwashed.

805
00:37:50,111 --> 00:37:51,912
You poor boy.

806
00:37:51,984 --> 00:37:53,386
Moogie, I'm serious.

807
00:37:53,423 --> 00:37:54,893
Oh, I know you are

808
00:37:54,927 --> 00:37:58,393
and I know how important
your problems are to you

809
00:37:58,439 --> 00:38:00,605
but frankly, Quark, right now

810
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,982
I don't give a damn about them!

811
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:06,121
We've got much bigger
problems to deal with.

812
00:38:06,163 --> 00:38:08,659
Do you want Brunt
to become Nagus?

813
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:10,197
Of course not.

814
00:38:10,242 --> 00:38:12,442
He was willing to throw our
entire economy into chaos

815
00:38:12,483 --> 00:38:13,680
just so he could grab power.

816
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,320
Sounds like a true Ferengi
to me.

817
00:38:16,362 --> 00:38:18,357
A Ferengi maybe...

818
00:38:18,401 --> 00:38:20,032
but not a Nagus.

819
00:38:20,074 --> 00:38:22,947
A Nagus has to be
better than that.

820
00:38:22,983 --> 00:38:24,579
His personal greed

821
00:38:24,622 --> 00:38:26,822
has to reflect
the public's greed.

822
00:38:26,862 --> 00:38:27,831
Like Zek.

823
00:38:27,865 --> 00:38:28,959
Exactly.

824
00:38:29,036 --> 00:38:32,012
So what are we going
to do about it?

825
00:38:37,931 --> 00:38:39,664
Did you see their faces?

826
00:38:39,703 --> 00:38:43,169
They thought they had me,
but we showed them.

827
00:38:43,215 --> 00:38:47,285
I answered all their questions,
didn't I?

828
00:38:47,328 --> 00:38:48,628
You certainly did!

829
00:38:48,665 --> 00:38:51,766
The state of the trade
negotiations with the Breen

830
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:54,248
why I dumped
our <i>lokar</i> bean investments

831
00:38:54,283 --> 00:38:55,776
why I insisted we buy up

832
00:38:55,822 --> 00:38:58,855
every bit of jevonite
we could get our hands on.

833
00:38:58,897 --> 00:39:00,162
You were brilliant!

834
00:39:00,202 --> 00:39:02,003
You know, for a moment there

835
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:04,445
I actually thought
that Brunt's head

836
00:39:04,483 --> 00:39:07,014
was going to explode
with frustration!

837
00:39:07,057 --> 00:39:09,223
By the time
I'm finished with him

838
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:10,495
he'll wish it had!

839
00:39:10,535 --> 00:39:11,903
Blam!

840
00:39:13,444 --> 00:39:15,005
Blam!

841
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:21,493
He underestimated me.

842
00:39:21,537 --> 00:39:23,703
And he underestimated
you, too.

843
00:39:23,744 --> 00:39:25,443
Me?

844
00:39:25,483 --> 00:39:26,851
I did nothing.

845
00:39:26,887 --> 00:39:27,981
Nonsense.

846
00:39:28,024 --> 00:39:30,395
I might have fooled
those Liquidators

847
00:39:30,432 --> 00:39:32,199
but I'm not fooling myself.

848
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:33,730
I'm becoming forgetful.

849
00:39:33,776 --> 00:39:35,805
At times,
my memory betrays me.

850
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:38,619
I hear the Vulcans
have been very successful

851
00:39:38,658 --> 00:39:40,219
at treating memory loss.

852
00:39:40,263 --> 00:39:41,928
Vulcans?

853
00:39:41,969 --> 00:39:43,462
Never liked them.

854
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:45,810
No appreciation of profit.

855
00:39:45,847 --> 00:39:49,382
But they do make good doctors,
don't they?

856
00:39:49,426 --> 00:39:52,299
Make an appointment for me.

857
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:58,749
I'll never forget
what you did for me, Rom.

858
00:39:58,789 --> 00:39:59,952
It's Quark.

859
00:39:59,992 --> 00:40:01,326
Ha-ha! Got you!

860
00:40:02,768 --> 00:40:05,139
I may have lost my memory

861
00:40:05,176 --> 00:40:07,376
but not my sense of humor!

862
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:13,329
As far as I'm concerned,
you're still my First Clerk.

863
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,638
Oh, I'm honored, O shrewd one

864
00:40:15,676 --> 00:40:19,084
but I'm afraid your confidence
in me is misplaced.

865
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,980
Maihar'du?

866
00:40:20,114 --> 00:40:23,888
Quark, I must say
I find your newfound modesty

867
00:40:23,926 --> 00:40:25,795
very annoying.

868
00:40:25,832 --> 00:40:28,899
I need a financial advisor,
and you're it.

869
00:40:28,942 --> 00:40:30,880
If you insist.

870
00:40:30,915 --> 00:40:33,252
But first...

871
00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:35,158
let me introduce to you...

872
00:40:35,196 --> 00:40:37,191
my financial advisor.

873
00:40:39,877 --> 00:40:42,077
Don't tell me.

874
00:40:44,592 --> 00:40:46,119
Zekkie.

875
00:40:46,164 --> 00:40:48,535
Why'd you bring
that female here?

876
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,874
Because the Nagus
deserves to have

877
00:40:50,912 --> 00:40:53,181
the best financial
advisor there is

878
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:54,519
and that's my Moogie.

879
00:40:54,557 --> 00:40:57,361
All the advice I gave
you today came from her.

880
00:40:57,399 --> 00:40:59,804
I'm not going to lie
to you, Zekkie.

881
00:40:59,841 --> 00:41:02,942
I believe in equal rights
for females.

882
00:41:04,322 --> 00:41:06,055
And someday,
I hope you will, too

883
00:41:06,093 --> 00:41:08,157
but I'd never do anything
to hurt you.

884
00:41:10,073 --> 00:41:11,669
But...

885
00:41:11,712 --> 00:41:14,847
what about all those rumors
that Quark told me?

886
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,450
They were lies.

887
00:41:16,493 --> 00:41:18,054
Tell him, Quark.

888
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:20,801
I guess I stretched the truth,
here and there.

889
00:41:20,841 --> 00:41:22,209
Yah!

890
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:25,050
Quark, you're fired!

891
00:41:25,088 --> 00:41:27,654
Now the question is:

892
00:41:27,696 --> 00:41:30,695
What am I going to do with you?

893
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,009
Anything you want.

894
00:41:34,217 --> 00:41:38,823
What man could resist
an offer like that?

895
00:41:40,404 --> 00:41:41,532
Ooh!

896
00:41:41,573 --> 00:41:44,572
Let's go home,
and I'll make dinner.

897
00:41:44,617 --> 00:41:45,917
No! You won't.

898
00:41:45,954 --> 00:41:47,983
Maihar'du will make dinner.

899
00:41:48,028 --> 00:41:50,467
I've got other plans for you!

900
00:41:50,502 --> 00:41:52,063
Oh, Zekkie!

901
00:41:56,923 --> 00:41:58,918
Quark, dinner's on the table.

902
00:41:58,963 --> 00:42:00,263
I'll be right there.

903
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,705
Leave some room.

904
00:42:02,742 --> 00:42:04,042
For what?

905
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,880
For these.

906
00:42:07,122 --> 00:42:08,422
Oh!

907
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:12,164
My Marauder Mo action figures.

908
00:42:12,205 --> 00:42:14,143
I thought you'd
thrown these out.

909
00:42:14,178 --> 00:42:15,147
All these years

910
00:42:15,181 --> 00:42:17,313
I've been keeping them
in storage for you.

911
00:42:17,355 --> 00:42:18,346
I figured you'd want

912
00:42:18,391 --> 00:42:20,455
to take them back
to Deep Space 9 with you.

913
00:42:20,498 --> 00:42:21,832
I sure do.

914
00:42:21,936 --> 00:42:24,604
Do you have any idea
how much these are worth?

915
00:42:24,645 --> 00:42:27,644
Not as much as if you'd kept
them in the original packaging

916
00:42:27,688 --> 00:42:29,957
which is what I told you
at the time.

917
00:42:29,995 --> 00:42:34,134
Even then, you were handing out
sound financial advice.

918
00:42:34,175 --> 00:42:36,512
Thanks, Moogie.

919
00:42:36,549 --> 00:42:38,350
No.

920
00:42:38,388 --> 00:42:40,452
Thank you, Quark.

921
00:42:50,293 --> 00:42:52,459
Brunt, FCA.

922
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,438
But for how much longer?

923
00:42:54,473 --> 00:42:57,847
Don't worry about me, Quark.

924
00:42:57,884 --> 00:42:59,515
I'm a survivor.

925
00:43:01,763 --> 00:43:05,571
So, the happy couple
are back together.

926
00:43:05,609 --> 00:43:08,311
If the people only knew.

927
00:43:08,351 --> 00:43:09,651
But they don't

928
00:43:09,689 --> 00:43:11,524
and you're not going
to tell them.

929
00:43:11,561 --> 00:43:12,689
Really?

930
00:43:12,731 --> 00:43:13,700
Why shouldn't I?

931
00:43:13,735 --> 00:43:15,205
Because the Nagus
is ready for you.

932
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:19,116
If you go against him,
you'll lose

933
00:43:19,152 --> 00:43:20,645
and you know it.

934
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,632
I hate losing.

935
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:25,798
What Ferengi doesn't?

936
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,979
I may not be able
to destroy the Nagus, but...

937
00:43:30,054 --> 00:43:32,186
you are a different story.

938
00:43:32,227 --> 00:43:35,693
You're going to revoke
my business license?

939
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,737
I don't think the Nagus
will like that.

940
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:42,921
On the contrary, I want you
back in business...

941
00:43:42,961 --> 00:43:45,264
gives me an opportunity
to keep my eye on you

942
00:43:45,302 --> 00:43:47,775
because one day you are
going to make a mistake

943
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:49,748
and on that day,
you're going to lose

944
00:43:49,783 --> 00:43:51,448
more than your license!

945
00:43:51,489 --> 00:43:53,553
But that day is not today.

946
00:43:53,595 --> 00:43:56,571
Now, back in the closet,
where you belong.

947
00:43:57,608 --> 00:44:00,081
It's not over, Quark!

948
00:44:01,253 --> 00:44:03,419
Don't make me come in there
after you.

949
00:44:05,399 --> 00:44:08,843
Quark, your tube grubs
are getting warm!

950
00:44:08,878 --> 00:44:10,405
Coming, Moogie!
