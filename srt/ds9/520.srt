1
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:04,546
(<i> phaser fire</i>
<i>and yelled commands</i> )

2
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,641
Who's winning the war?

3
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,768
It's too early to tell.

4
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,353
It's been three days.

5
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,062
Don't remind me.

6
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,441
They found a nest.

7
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,651
Well, that's good.

8
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,068
It's not the main nest.

9
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,696
That's not so good.

10
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:30,781
I thought
Chief O'Brien

11
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:34,201
trapped the last vole
on the station months ago.

12
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,953
Well, obviously,
he missed a couple--

13
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:38,372
a married couple.

14
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,623
They breed like tribbles.

15
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:42,083
But they're not as cute.

16
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,461
They're disgusting
hairy little creatures

17
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,797
with ravenous appetites,
and I want them gone.

18
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:47,840
Oh, Quark.

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,174
I know, I know--

20
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,010
this is just
a temporary setback.

21
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,679
The bar will open again,
and I can get back to my life.

22
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,389
I'm glad you
realize that.

23
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,098
The only trouble is,
I<i> hate</i> my life.

24
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,188
(<i> door chimes</i> )

25
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,773
(<i> sighs</i> )

26
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,817
Come in.

27
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:09,403
<i>Hello,</i> Brother.

28
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,112
What do you want?

29
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:13,073
You have every right
to be depressed, Brother.

30
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,783
Ever since you were blacklisted

31
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,535
by the Ferengi
Commerce Authority

32
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,787
it's been one thing
after another,<i> but...</i>

33
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:22,249
I have some news
that's going to cheer you up.

34
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,584
I doubt it.

35
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,293
Trust me on this
one, Brother.

36
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:28,756
I'm about to make you
very,<i> very</i> happy.

37
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:29,757
Really?

38
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:30,799
Really.

39
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,467
Come on in.

40
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,558
What's she doing here?

41
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:42,061
We're getting married!

42
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:44,229
Oh... I wish I was dead.

43
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,024
He's been a little
depressed lately.

44
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,901
I don't want to live.

45
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:51,695
I think you need someone
to talk to...

46
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,321
someone to pamper you.

47
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,824
I think I need to be alone.

48
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,158
You know who
I talk to

49
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,493
when I'm feeling
a little low?

50
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,079
Yeah, me.

51
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,455
Not when it's something
really important.

52
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:04,666
Let me guess--
Chief O'Brien?

53
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,085
That's not a bad guess.

54
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:08,921
Rom... just tell me
who it is.

55
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:12,633
Then you can leave, and I
can go back to my brooding.

56
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,301
There's only one person
in my life

57
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,803
who's always
been there for me

58
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,512
who's never too busy
to listen

59
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:20,099
who reassures me
when I'm scared

60
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,850
comforts me when I'm sad

61
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,852
and who showers me
with endless love

62
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,396
without ever asking anything
in return.

63
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,732
I'd like to meet
this person.

64
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:29,858
So would I.

65
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,485
You already know her.

66
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,904
And she'll always be
there for you, Brother

67
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,156
with open arms.

68
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:50,504
(<i> doorbell buzzes repeatedly)</i>

69
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,467
Quark?

70
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,176
Mother.

71
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,933
Moogie...

72
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,936
(<i> voice breaks</i> ):
hold me.

73
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,478
Of all the Bajoran prophecies

74
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,355
I think my favorite
is Horran's Seventh--

75
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,109
The one that starts:
"He will come to the palace

76
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,278
"carrying a chalice..."

77
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:20,779
"Bearing no malice..."

78
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,031
"Overflowing
with sweet spring wine."

79
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,658
Someone's been studying
the ancient texts.

80
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,326
It's important
to Leeta.

81
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,162
She wants
a traditional Bajoran wedding.

82
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:30,497
And you've agreed to it?

83
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,166
Oh, that's
very sweet, Rom.

84
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,001
Is she doing
the same for you?

85
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,586
I mean, learning to
be a Ferengi woman?

86
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,337
Memorizing
the Rules of Acquisition...

87
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:40,048
Not likely.

88
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,217
No, Leeta's not the type
of woman to quit her job

89
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,593
stop wearing clothes

90
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,053
and never go out
in public again.

91
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,345
That's okay.

92
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,056
I just want her to be happy.

93
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,391
That's a very
enlightened
attitude, Rom.

94
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:53,228
Rom is not your
traditional Ferengi male.

95
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,147
I... guess not.

96
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:58,108
You're probably the least
Ferengi-like Ferengi

97
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,151
I've ever met.

98
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,111
I... guess so.

99
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,571
Oh, that's not
a bad thing, Rom.

100
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,699
No traditional
Ferengi male

101
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,244
could ever marry a
non-Ferengi and be happy.

102
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:11,746
Well, he could
never trust her.

103
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,881
So you see, Moogie, the voles
aren't the real problem.

104
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,465
They're just a symbol
for everything else

105
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,967
that's gone wrong in my life.

106
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,510
You've had a tough
year, Quark.

107
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,221
That's an understatement.

108
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,139
I see all these great
opportunities out there

109
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,682
and I can't do anything
about them.

110
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:33,185
Without a Ferengi
business license

111
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,729
it's like I don't exist.

112
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,647
I understand why
you felt the need

113
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,108
to escape for a while,
but why come here?

114
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,069
I had no place else to go.

115
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,778
Are you sure
about that?

116
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,947
Oh, now, don't
give me that look.

117
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,406
You and I both know

118
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,201
we've never really
gotten along.

119
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:51,410
You disapprove
of me, Quark.

120
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,871
You always have.

121
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,956
"Moogie, stop
wearing clothes."

122
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,833
"Moogie, stop
earning profit."

123
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,293
You<i> have</i> stopped,
haven't you?

124
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,920
I mean, earning profit.

125
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,462
Wearing clothes is bad enough,
but profit--

126
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,298
You see what I mean?

127
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,800
I know the two of us
living under the same roof

128
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,262
isn't going to be easy,
but you're my mother...

129
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:09,721
and I love you.

130
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,515
And I love you, too, Quark.

131
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,518
But when you say
"living together"

132
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,271
what are we talking about--

133
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,855
a day, a week?

134
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,190
Two weeks?

135
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,775
I don't know.

136
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,069
I guess
until I start feeling better--

137
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,779
unless, of course,
you don't want me.

138
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,282
You're my son.

139
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,117
How could I refuse you?

140
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,744
Then you'll remove
all that unnecessary clothing?

141
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:35,330
Don't push your luck.

142
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,293
Where are you going?

143
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,295
To my room.
I'm exhausted.

144
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:45,090
What you need is some
of your mother's cooking--

145
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,259
some nice, juicy tube grubs.

146
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,219
I never liked your tube grubs.

147
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,721
I'll pre-chew them for you.

148
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,598
Maybe later.

149
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,400
Hello, room.

150
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,695
Where's all my stuff?

151
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:11,992
If she's thrown out
my Marauder Mo action figures...

152
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,044
Grand Nagus?

153
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,255
Quark, what are
you doing here?

154
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,715
Uh... I'm visiting my mother.

155
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,134
That's no excuse!

156
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,219
You've been banned
by the FCA.

157
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:34,014
You must leave
Ferenginar at once!

158
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:36,641
Got to go.

159
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,186
The Nagus,
he knows I'm here.

160
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,645
Wait a minute.

161
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:44,358
What's the Nagus doing
in my closet?

162
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:45,525
The Nagus?

163
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,361
Moogie?

164
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:49,612
Zekkie!

165
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,614
You might as well come out!

166
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,074
"Zekkie"?

167
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,368
(<i> whispering</i> ):
What's going on?

168
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:55,952
The next time you visit

169
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:59,414
I'd really appreciate it
if you called first.

170
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,957
That doesn't answer my question.

171
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,544
"Sometimes the only thing

172
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,381
"more dangerous
than a question

173
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,924
is an answer."

174
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,343
Rule of Acquisition 208.

175
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:12,886
You're in trouble
again, aren't you?

176
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,595
What have you done now?

177
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,139
Whatever it is, I had
nothing to do with it.

178
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,265
Tell him, Moogie.

179
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,808
Tell him I'm innocent.

180
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,228
Relax, Quark.
I'm not in any trouble.

181
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,312
You're not?

182
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,355
Why would she

183
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:24,439
be in trouble?

184
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,066
I don't know.

185
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,443
I-I-I just thought,
since you're here...

186
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:32,197
Uh... I don't...
I don't know what I thought.

187
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,532
I'm so confused.

188
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,367
About what?

189
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:38,870
It's all really quite simple.

190
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,789
You see, Quark, uh...

191
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,418
your mother and I, uh...

192
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,753
are in love.

193
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,849
How did you
two... meet?

194
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:03,144
We met at the global
<i>tongo</i> championships.

195
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,812
That's right.

196
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,815
I was playing in the Golden
Masters Division.

197
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,568
And I was tucked away

198
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:12,320
in the subbasement playing
in the Female Division.

199
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,073
Anyway, word
leaked down to us

200
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:16,699
that the Grand Nagus
was having

201
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,411
a little difficulty
with his game.

202
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:20,828
Well, for some reason

203
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:24,416
my purchases
kept exceeding my sales.

204
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,667
So I wrote him a note

205
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,878
offering some
helpful pointers

206
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,047
on how to firm
up his game.

207
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,466
And they worked.

208
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,175
I made a spectacular comeback

209
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,596
and won the tournament
for the 27th year in a row.

210
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:40,432
ISHKA:
Zekkie sent me a very nice

211
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:41,682
"thank you" note.

212
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,101
Before I knew it

213
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,978
we were corresponding
regularly.

214
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:48,856
Your mother's letters became
the highlight of each day.

215
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,733
It was clear we had to meet.

216
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,193
Imagine his surprise

217
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,446
when he found out
I was a female

218
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:57,698
and<i> your</i> mother,
no less.

219
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,201
I almost had a<i> stroke</i>

220
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,662
but, uh... I recovered.

221
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,499
And we've been seeing
each other ever since.

222
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:06,916
(<i> both cooing</i> )

223
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,044
Does anyone know about this?

224
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,546
Of course, no one knows

225
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:14,424
and you're going
to keep it that way.

226
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,467
My lips are sealed.

227
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,051
They'd better be.

228
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:20,180
Oh, jellied gree worms.

229
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,431
Maihar'du

230
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,932
you are
too good to me.

231
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,560
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

232
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,062
He treats me like a queen.

233
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:31,483
That's because
you deserve no less.

234
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:36,571
Zekkie, they don't come
any sweeter than you.

235
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:37,656
(<i> laughing</i> )

236
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,199
I don't believe it.

237
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,575
What's that, Quark?

238
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,494
Uh, nothing.

239
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:45,413
I've never seen you
looking happier.

240
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:49,501
That's because
I've never felt happier.

241
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,545
(<i> giggling</i> )

242
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,004
Well, my dear

243
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,507
time to get back
to running the Empire.

244
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,592
Try not to miss me
too much.

245
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,427
I miss you already.

246
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,680
That's my girl.

247
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:07,268
Oh, Lobekins...

248
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,770
don't forget
your appointment calendar.

249
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,773
Thank you, my prize.

250
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,651
Your mother

251
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,820
is a rare jewel, Quark.

252
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,114
Worship her...

253
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,199
as I do.

254
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,367
(<i> blows kiss</i> )

255
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,294
Incredible.

256
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,004
Quark...

257
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,131
if you're going to give me
a hard time about this--

258
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:40,552
Give you a hard time?

259
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,637
You and the Nagus?

260
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:45,764
I couldn't be happier...

261
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,767
for<i> all</i> of us.

262
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,777
No sign of
a single vole.

263
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,197
I think we
got them all.

264
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,449
ROM:
Chief

265
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,908
is it all right
if I take

266
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,619
a slightly longer
lunch than usual?

267
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,078
I need Leeta to sign this.

268
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:10,373
The Waiver of Property
and Profit.

269
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:11,790
Ferengi females
aren't allowed

270
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,668
to own property
or earn profit.

271
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,086
The WP&amp;P states

272
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,755
that, in the event
the marriage ends

273
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,757
the female gives up
all claim

274
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:20,341
to her husband's estate.

275
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,302
And you expect Leeta
to agree to this?

276
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,721
I agreed to wear the earring.

277
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,599
So either Leeta signs this
or the wedding's off.

278
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,267
I may not be
a traditional Ferengi

279
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,226
but I'm still a Ferengi.

280
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,852
It's your life

281
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,688
but I think you're making
a big mistake.

282
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:37,108
I think I'd be making
a bigger mistake if I didn't.

283
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,277
Besides, Leeta loves me.

284
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,695
You'll see, Chief.

285
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,280
She'll sign it.

286
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,157
Are you crazy?

287
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,824
I'm not going
to sign this.

288
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,535
Why not?

289
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,580
Because a marriage is
about sharing everything

290
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,914
including money.

291
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,625
Not on Ferenginar.

292
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,794
We're not<i> on</i> Ferenginar.

293
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,462
But I'm a Ferengi.

294
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,422
And I'm not.

295
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,591
"Females and finances
don't mix."

296
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,593
Rule of Acquisition 94.

297
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,553
That's a stupid rule.

298
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,306
It's true.

299
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,683
You're just like her.

300
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,559
You're after my money.

301
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,851
Like who?

302
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,228
My first wife...

303
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,647
pretending that
you care about me

304
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,398
but, all the time,
it's my profits

305
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,692
that you
really care about.

306
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,735
Rom...

307
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:24,030
I love<i> you...</i>

308
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,699
not your latinum.

309
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:26,866
Then prove it.

310
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,035
Sign the WP&amp;P.

311
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,203
Never.

312
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,205
Then the marriage is off.

313
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,707
You bet it is.

314
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,214
My dear, you reek
of tube grubs.

315
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,298
(<i> sniffing</i> )

316
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,550
So do you, Lobekins.

317
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,092
Are your ears
tingling?

318
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,761
Mine, too.

319
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:47,887
(<i> both laughing</i> )

320
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,681
So tell me, Nagus--

321
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,432
how was your day?

322
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,476
Oh, you know how it is.

323
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,229
Arcybite ore futures
are continuing to increase

324
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,398
<i>and</i> the Bolians
have finally agreed

325
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,567
to allow the Ferengi
Gaming Commission to take over

326
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,443
all their
gambling emporiums.

327
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,487
And... and...

328
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,489
Huh? Mm... Oh!

329
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:10,702
I have decided to allocate
extra funds for research

330
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:13,287
on a new breed
of Hupyrian beetles.

331
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,916
Those little fellows
are going to revolutionize

332
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,586
the entire beetle snuff
industry.

333
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,672
Now that's what I call
a busy and productive day.

334
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,091
QUARK:
No wonder
the Ferengi economy

335
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,885
is growing at a record pace.

336
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,178
Costs are down,
profits are up...

337
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:33,015
And opportunity is
around every corner.

338
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,476
Zekkie, you've done
quite a job.

339
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,311
And your people love you
for it--

340
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,814
your business acumen,
your negotiation skills

341
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,609
your kindness and generosity.

342
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,193
Forget it, Quark.

343
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,112
I'm not going to reverse
the FCA's decision.

344
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,406
They revoked your
business license

345
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,867
and they're the ones who are
going to have to reinstate it.

346
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,745
But you're the most powerful man
on Ferenginar.

347
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:55,996
You can do whatever you want.

348
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,624
True, but contracts

349
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,126
are the very basis
of our society

350
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:03,671
and you broke a contract
with another Ferengi.

351
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,674
If I were to intervene
on your behalf

352
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,760
I would be
encouraging others

353
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,303
to violate the law!

354
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,305
And that I will not do!

355
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,973
Moogie...

356
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,767
talk to him.

357
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,894
He makes a very
good point, Quark.

358
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,437
What you did was wrong.

359
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,355
Thanks.
I knew I could count on<i> you.</i>

360
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,065
(<i> slurping</i> )

361
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,192
And I'd watch my tone
of voice if I were you.

362
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:28,279
Well, my dear, shall
we take a stroll

363
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,072
in your garden?

364
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,325
Oh, and, Quark, will
you do me a favor?

365
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,118
Help Maihar'du
clear the table.

366
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,746
He's not as young
as he used to be.

367
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,802
(<i> sighs heavily</i> )

368
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,013
(<i> whir of active transport</i> )

369
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,896
Brunt, FCA.

370
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,821
What are you doing
in my closet?!

371
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:12,782
Conducting official
FCA business.

372
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,325
In my closet?

373
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,828
I didn't want the "happy
couple" to see me.

374
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,287
Happy couple?

375
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,833
Oh, don't play innocent
with me.

376
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:28,214
I know all about their
<i>perverted</i> little love affair.

377
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,799
I had nothing
to do with it.

378
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,175
They met playing<i> tongo.</i>

379
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,886
I only found out
about it today.

380
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:35,346
She's your mother, Quark

381
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,473
and that makes
<i>you</i> responsible.

382
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,392
And right now,
she's endangering

383
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:43,062
the very<i> foundation</i>
<i>of Ferengi society.</i>

384
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,358
I can see her now,
whispering in the Nagus' ear

385
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,485
contaminating
his very thoughts

386
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,905
with her twisted
female philosophies.

387
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,447
I tell you, Quark--

388
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,825
if we don't put an end
to their relationship

389
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,869
you're going to see
clothed females

390
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:59,913
walking down the streets
of Ferenginar

391
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,664
in broad daylight.

392
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,207
If I had my way

393
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,168
I'd climb to the top
of the Tower of Commerce

394
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,756
and<i> denounce</i> your mother
to the crowd below

395
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:13,051
<i>but...</i> we must
spare the Nagus

396
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:16,846
even a<i> hint</i> of
public disgrace.

397
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:20,474
We've got to put an end
to their relationship but...

398
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,976
(<i> whispering</i> ):
privately.

399
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,771
Quietly.

400
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,439
So, what are you
going to do?

401
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,232
<i>I'm</i> not going
to do anything.

402
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,442
You are.

403
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,443
Me?

404
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,861
Who else?

405
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,738
She's your mother,
and the Nagus--

406
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,074
for reasons that
elude me completely--

407
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:37,324
likes you.

408
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,826
You're in the
perfect position

409
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,661
to poison their
relationship.

410
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:44,290
Why should I help you?

411
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,126
You revoked
my business license.

412
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,005
I'll give you a new one.

413
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,382
You've got a deal.

414
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:02,433
Once again, O Nagus,
you have proven

415
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:07,730
that you have the wisest lobes
in all of Ferenginar.

416
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,399
That's what they<i> pay</i> me for, eh?

417
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,151
(<i> chuckling</i> )

418
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,006
I need to speak to the Nagus.

419
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,423
It's a personal
matter--

420
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,591
nothing for you
to worry about.

421
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,135
What do you want, Quark?

422
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,053
I just dropped by
to pay my respects.

423
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,972
Well, in that case, pay them.

424
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:43,182
Oh.

425
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,021
Feel better?

426
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,147
Now go.

427
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:50,564
Before I do

428
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,191
I just want to say
how proud I am

429
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,986
that you consider<i> my</i> home
your home.

430
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,697
My mother is a very lucky woman.

431
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,323
And I am a very lucky man.

432
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,951
I guess the only one
around here

433
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,037
who<i> isn't</i> lucky
is you, Quark.

434
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,913
(<i> snickering</i> )

435
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:09,458
I just think it's great
that she's found someone

436
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,920
who cares for her so deeply
that he can ignore

437
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,381
all those vicious rumors
about her.

438
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:19,218
Oh, you mean the rumors
about her earning profit?

439
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,137
I know that whole story.

440
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,222
The FCA made her give up

441
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,807
every strip of latinum
she made.

442
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,266
(<i> sneezing</i> )

443
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,352
I'm talking about
the other rumors.

444
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,063
The ones that say that she
<i>hasn't</i> given it all back.

445
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,814
Oh, nonsense.

446
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:35,526
Of course, it is,
and the wildest rumor has to be

447
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,319
what she plans to<i> do</i>
<i>with her fortune--</i>

448
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,279
that she's going to fund
a political revolution

449
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:42,116
to end the male domination
on Ferenginar.

450
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,826
You mean...

451
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,704
equal rights for females?

452
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,915
It's crazy, isn't it?

453
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:52,376
I mean, so what
if she wears clothing

454
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,503
or that she's managed
to worm her way into the heart

455
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,672
of the most influential
Ferengi alive.

456
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,132
Those aren't crimes, are they?

457
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,967
Absolutely not.

458
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:05,014
And what if she's as cunning
and ruthless as any male?

459
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:08,475
That doesn't mean
that she's not to be trusted...

460
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,144
does it?

461
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:12,021
The important thing is

462
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,773
that she loves you

463
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,399
and that you're not some pawn

464
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,526
in her plans
for world domination.

465
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,029
World domination?

466
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,614
By a female?!

467
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,992
It's a horrifying thought.

468
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,578
Luckily, they're just rumors.

469
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,538
Rumors.

470
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,541
Well, time to go.

471
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,252
I'll see you tonight, Nagus.

472
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:36,045
I know Moogie can hardly wait.

473
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,296
For what?

474
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,299
For you to get home.

475
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,305
Now that he mentions it

476
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,558
she really has no business
wearing clothes

477
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,311
i-in front of her Nagus.

478
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,816
(<i> Ishka humming</i> )

479
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,570
I should start dinner.

480
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,322
Zekkie'll be here
any minute.

481
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,159
What do you say to
some nice slug steaks?

482
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,994
I'm not hungry.

483
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:09,912
Quark, the power
cells are empty.

484
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:12,873
I must have been
too depressed to notice.

485
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,042
It's the FCA
ban, isn't it?

486
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,294
It's awful.

487
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:18,045
You don't know what it's like

488
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,213
to be denied the opportunity
to earn profit.

489
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:20,673
Oh, yes, I do.

490
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:21,799
I know<i> exactly</i>
<i>what it's like.</i>

491
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,634
It's worse for a male.

492
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:24,635
Is it?

493
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,012
Moogie...

494
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:27,721
I'm...

495
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:31,225
in no mood to argue
politics right now.

496
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:32,893
I'm too distressed.

497
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:35,688
All right, Quark.

498
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,106
I'll talk to the Nagus.

499
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,233
I'll see if I can
convince him

500
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,194
to intercede
on your behalf.

501
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:43,779
Oh, Moogie.

502
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:47,783
You're a manipulative,
self-centered conniver.

503
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,035
Thank you.

504
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,744
Now, Zek'll be
here any minute.

505
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,079
I'll make myself scarce.

506
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,455
Good luck.

507
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,333
I'm counting on you.

508
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,470
ODO:
Commander, I'm sorry if
the Klingons are unhappy

509
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,264
but station rules
are station rules.

510
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:12,058
I am well aware
of station rules

511
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,060
but General Martok
is a great warrior.

512
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,520
<i>And</i> he has no business
being in a holding cell.

513
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,314
He threw one of his
men off that crossway.

514
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,357
That was
a disciplinary measure.

515
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:20,649
Oh.

516
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:21,859
Besides, K'retok
was not injured.

517
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:23,361
He was barely shaken up.

518
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:24,945
As opposed to the
Bolian Ambassador.

519
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,655
K'retok only missed
her by a centimeter.

520
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,115
But he did miss her.

521
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,576
Constable...
release General Martok.

522
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:31,827
Sir...

523
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,371
Mr. Worf, tell the General

524
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:34,955
that this is not
a Klingon space station.

525
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,999
If he can't abide
by the regulations

526
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:39,835
I'm sure Chancellor Gowron
will send us someone who can.

527
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,046
Understood.

528
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,089
Constable?

529
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,173
Understood.

530
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:45,716
(<i> sobbing</i> )

531
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,009
Do you hear that?

532
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,428
(<i> sobbing continues</i> )

533
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,271
Rom?

534
00:23:58,271 --> 00:23:59,772
Are you all right?

535
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,107
I'm fine Captain.

536
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:02,649
Thanks for asking.

537
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,110
(<i> continues</i>
<i>sobbing</i> )

538
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,820
The wedding is off.

539
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,863
I'm sorry.

540
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,823
Don't be, Captain.

541
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,993
These are tears of joy.

542
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,707

Did the Nagus say no?

Don't you think about
anyone but yourself?

All I asked him was to

that I was just using him

573
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:39,038
that I was a scheming,

signs the waiver

then she can't
own anything

it all back to you.

to hold her in my arms again.

722
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,451
Anything?

723
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:03,046
One<i> jumja</i> stick, please.

724
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,800
What flavor?

725
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,218
Actually...

726
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,178
I don't like<i> jumja</i> sticks.

727
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,806
Then what<i> do</i> you want, Rom?

728
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,641
I want you to marry me.

729
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,270
I'm not signing that waiver.

730
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,146
You don't have to--
not anymore.

731
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,482
I don't have
any profit left to protect.

732
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,692
I don't understand.

733
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,360
I gave all my latinum

734
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,655
to Major Kira for the Bajoran
War Orphans Fund.

735
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,156
She kissed me.

736
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:33,243
Oh, Rom!

737
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,538
You did that for me?

738
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,331
I did it for us.

739
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:41,293
Now we have nothing
but our love.

740
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:44,212
That's all we need.

741
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,672
That...

742
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,550
<i>and</i> my salary
from Quark's.

743
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,522
Well done, Chief--

744
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,817
or should I
call you Cupid?

745
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:06,359
What can I say?

746
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,028
I'm just
an incurable romantic.

747
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,572
(<i> laughing</i> )

748
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,409
Quark, where have
you been all day?

749
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,619
With the Nagus.

750
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:16,954
He made me his First Clerk.

751
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:18,455
I see.

752
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:19,706
Well, then you've
had a miserable day

753
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:20,916
haven't you?

754
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,334
The worst day of my life.

755
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,002
How'd you know?

756
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:27,213
The Market Exchange
is down 199 points.

757
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,342
I don't know
if I should tell you this

758
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:31,468
but I have to tell someone.

759
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:32,594
The Nagus, he is...

760
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:34,053
I know.

761
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:35,639
His memory isn't
what it used to be.

762
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,265
Did you try
stroking his lobes?

763
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,976
No, I didn't stroke
his lobes.

764
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:40,727
It helps focus him.

765
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,563
It's also not a bad idea
if you repeat what you say

766
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,106
to him.

767
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,359
Sometimes it takes two,
even three times

768
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,944
before he'll retain it.

769
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,238
You two weren't just lovers.

770
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,282
You were helping him run things.

771
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:57,410
<i>You're</i> the power
behind the throne?

772
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,371
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

773
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:02,457
I just helped him a little--
guided him.

774
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,001
A leveraged buyout here

775
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:05,752
some momentum
investing there....

776
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,587
Why didn't you tell me?

777
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:10,465
If I'd known what was going on,
I never would have...

778
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:12,926
Never would have what?

779
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,929
Oh, Quark.

780
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,097
<i>You</i> turned Zek against me,
didn't you?

781
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:21,184
You filled his head
with all those lies about me.

782
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,144
I didn't know.

783
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,646
Who put you up to this?

784
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,147
Who do you think?

785
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,233
Brunt.

786
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,068
What did he offer you?

787
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,153
Your business license back?

788
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,447
"A Ferengi without profit
is no Ferengi at all."

789
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,908
You taught me that.

790
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:37,283
The Rules of Acquisition

791
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,660
aren't going to help
you now, Quark.

792
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,412
A 199-point slide.

793
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,497
And that's just
the beginning.

794
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,249
Congratulations, Quark.

795
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:47,794
You've not only destroyed
my life and Zek's life

796
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,463
you may have triggered
the destruction

797
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,758
of the entire
Ferengi economy.

798
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:55,343
I hope it was worth it.

799
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:09,816
My, aren't we early today.

800
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:15,530
But I suppose
after yesterday's<i> fiasco...</i>

801
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,533
we have no alternative.

802
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:23,413
A 199-point<i> plummet!</i>

803
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:24,831
(<i> chuckling</i> )

804
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,793
Haven't seen that steep
a market slide

805
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:29,669
since Grand Nagus Smeet

806
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,212
and you know
what happened to him?

807
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,672
The only Grand Nagus

808
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,340
to be assassinated
while in office.

809
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,427
What was the name
of his First Clerk?

810
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:39,638
I believe they buried
them together.

811
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,514
I'm sure we'll
do better today.

812
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,182
No, you won't.

813
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:46,645
The Market Exchange
will remain closed today.

814
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:50,523
The FCA Board of Liquidators
has called

815
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,192
an emergency meeting
with the Grand Nagus.

816
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:56,822
We have some...
questions to ask him.

817
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,865
And by the time
we're through

818
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,451
you'll both be
out of a job.

819
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,328
Why are you
picking on me?

820
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,831
I've done everything
you asked, haven't I?

821
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:07,540
Everything.

822
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,542
(<i> inhales deeply</i> )

823
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:13,171
Oh...

824
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,341
Grand Nagus...

825
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,968
Brunt.

826
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,804
Daddy will be so proud.

827
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:24,349
You knew the truth about the
Nagus all along, didn't you?

828
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,559
You mean,
about Zek's failing memory?

829
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,353
Let me think.

830
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:29,980
Hmm...

831
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,816
Well, you know,
now that you mention it...

832
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:35,443
yes, I did.

833
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,529
That's why you wanted
to destroy his relationship

834
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,781
with my mother,
not to protect him...

835
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:42,367
but to expose him.

836
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,494
I couldn't have done it
without you.

837
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:47,164
I feel almost... grateful

838
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:49,582
which is why I'm going
to let you keep

839
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,292
your new business license.

840
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:54,629
Now, put down those padds,
pack your things

841
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:58,133
and scurry on back
to that little bar of yours.

842
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,971
ISHKA:
So, how come you're
still here, Quark?

843
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:04,597
After all, Brunt is right.

844
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,142
You should be back
on Deep Space 9

845
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:08,685
celebrating your victory.

846
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:11,270
You've proven yourself
a true Ferengi.

847
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,606
You've betrayed friends
and family

848
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,192
for personal gain.

849
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:16,943
It sounds so good
when you say it.

850
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,695
But...?

851
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:25,118
I think I've been hanging around
hu-mans too long.

852
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:27,996
I think I'm developing a...

853
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,455
Conscience?

854
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:33,418
It's been coming
for a long time.

855
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:36,922
I've fought against it,
I<i> really</i> have.

856
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:40,759
But living with those people
day in and day out

857
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:43,970
being exposed to their ethics,
their morality...

858
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:47,599
It's like I've been brainwashed.

859
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,186
You poor boy.

860
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,520
Moogie, I'm serious.

861
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,231
Oh, I know you are

862
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:57,442
and I know how important
your problems are to you

863
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,736
but frankly, Quark,
right now

864
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:02,072
I don't give a
damn about them!

865
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:05,158
We've got much bigger
problems to deal with.

866
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:07,827
Do you want Brunt
to become Nagus?

867
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,621
Of course not.

868
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,664
he was willing to throw our
entire economy into chaos

869
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,125
just so he could grab power.

870
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:15,460
Sounds like a true Ferengi
to me.

871
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,545
A Ferengi maybe...

872
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,131
but not a Nagus.

873
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:22,217
A Nagus has to be
better than that.

874
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:23,760
His personal greed

875
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,845
<i>has</i> to reflect
the public's greed.

876
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:26,846
Like Zek.

877
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,431
Exactly.

878
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,309
So what are<i> we</i> going
to do about it?

879
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,065
(<i> laughter</i> )

880
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,858
ZEK:
Did you see their faces?

881
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:42,154
They thought they had me,
but we showed them.

882
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:46,324
I answered all their questions,
didn't I?

883
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,076
You certainly did!

884
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,912
The state of the trade
negotiations with the Breen

885
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:53,290
why I dumped
our<i> lokar</i> bean investments

886
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,000
why I insisted we buy up

887
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,003
every bit of jevonite
we could get our hands on.

888
00:38:58,003 --> 00:38:59,378
You were brilliant!

889
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:01,089
You know, for
a moment there

890
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:03,549
I actually thought
that Brunt's head

891
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:06,219
was going to explode
with frustration!

892
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:08,263
By the time
I'm finished with him

893
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:09,639
he'll wish it had!

894
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,099
Blam!

895
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,517
(<i> both laughing</i> )

896
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,269
Blam!

897
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,188
(<i> all laughing</i> )

898
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:20,566
He underestimated me.

899
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,819
And he underestimated
you, too.

900
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,487
Me?

901
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,031
I did nothing.

902
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:27,490
Nonsense.

903
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,408
I might have fooled
those Liquidators

904
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:31,286
but I'm not fooling myself.

905
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,829
I'm becoming forgetful.

906
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,831
At times,
my memory betrays me.

907
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:37,709
I hear the Vulcans
have been very successful

908
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,336
at treating memory loss.

909
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:41,087
Vulcans?

910
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,505
Never liked them.

911
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,924
No appreciation of profit.

912
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:47,052
But they do make good doctors

913
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:48,386
don't they?

914
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,514
Make an appointment for me.

915
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,310
I'll never forget

916
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,729
what you did
for me, Rom.

917
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,064
It's Quark.

918
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:00,315
Ha-ha! Got you!

919
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,774
(<i> cackling</i> )

920
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,236
I may have lost my memory

921
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:06,321
but not my sense of humor!

922
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,447
(<i> laughs</i> )

923
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:12,285
As far as I'm concerned,
you're still my First Clerk.

924
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,453
Oh, I'm honored, O shrewd one

925
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:18,083
but I'm afraid your confidence
in me is misplaced.

926
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,792
Maihar'du?

927
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:23,504
Quark, I must say
I find your newfound modesty

928
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,215
very annoying.

929
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:28,467
I need a financial advisor,
and you're it.

930
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,428
If you insist.

931
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,889
But first...

932
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,766
let me introduce to you...

933
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,851
<i>my</i> financial advisor.

934
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:41,689
Don't tell me.

935
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:45,693
Zekkie.

936
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,113
Why'd you bring
that female here?

937
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:50,282
Because the Nagus
deserves to have

938
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:52,700
the best financial
advisor there is

939
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,411
and that's my Moogie.

940
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:56,913
All the advice I gave
you today came from her.

941
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:59,374
I'm not going to lie
to you, Zekkie.

942
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:01,042
I believe
in equal rights

943
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:02,501
for females.

944
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,962
(<i> scoffs</i> )

945
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,588
And someday,
I hope you will, too

946
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,799
but I'd never do anything
to hurt you.

947
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,386
But...

948
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:14,431
what about all those rumors
that Quark told me?

949
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:16,141
They were lies.

950
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:17,516
Tell him, Quark.

951
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:19,394
I guess I stretched
the truth

952
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:20,437
here and there.

953
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:21,771
Yah!

954
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:24,649
Quark, you're fired!

955
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:27,319
Now the question is:

956
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:30,363
What am I going to do
with you?

957
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:32,615
Anything you want.

958
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:38,455
What man could resist
an offer like that?

959
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:39,956
(<i> cackling</i> )

960
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:41,291
Ooh!

961
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:44,127
Let's go home,
and I'll make dinner.

962
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:45,503
No! You won't.

963
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,297
Maihar'du
will make dinner.

964
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:50,049
<i>I've</i> got other
plans for<i> you!</i>

965
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,509
Oh, Zekkie!

966
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,804
(<i> both laughing</i> )

967
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,389
(<i> gasps</i> )

968
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:58,391
ISHKA:
Quark, dinner's on the table.

969
00:41:58,391 --> 00:41:59,767
I'll be right there.

970
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,354
Leave some room.

971
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:03,562
For what?

972
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,606
For these.

973
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:07,984
Oh!

974
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:11,529
My Marauder Mo
action figures.

975
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,323
I thought you'd
thrown these out.

976
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:14,824
All these years

977
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,493
I've been keeping them
in storage for you.

978
00:42:16,493 --> 00:42:18,244
I figured you'd want

979
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,996
to take them back
to Deep Space 9 with you.

980
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,747
I sure do.

981
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:24,042
Do you have any idea
how much these are worth?

982
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:27,170
Not as much as if you'd kept
them in the original packaging

983
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,464
which is what I told you
at the time.

984
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:33,592
Even then, you were handing out
sound financial advice.

985
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:36,054
Thanks, Moogie.

986
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:37,847
No.

987
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:39,974
Thank<i> you,</i> Quark.

988
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,815
(<i> whir of active transport</i> )

989
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,944
Brunt, FCA.

990
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,821
But for how much longer?

991
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:57,367
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
Don't worry about me, Quark.

992
00:42:57,367 --> 00:42:58,993
I'm a survivor.

993
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:05,124
So, the happy couple
are back together.

994
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,710
If the people only knew.

995
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,128
But they don't

996
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,880
and you're not going
to tell them.

997
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,839
Really?

998
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,383
Why shouldn't I?

999
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:14,926
Because the Nagus
is ready for you.

1000
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:18,555
If you go against
him, you'll lose

1001
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:20,181
and you know it.

1002
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,101
I hate losing.

1003
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,228
What Ferengi doesn't?

1004
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:29,524
I may not be able to
destroy the Nagus, but...

1005
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,484
you are a different story.

1006
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:35,113
You're going to revoke
my business license?

1007
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:38,199
I don't think the Nagus
will like that.

1008
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:40,868
On the contrary,
I want you

1009
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,620
back in business--

1010
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,497
gives me an opportunity
to keep my eye on you

1011
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:47,166
because one day you are
going to make a mistake

1012
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,168
and on that day,
you're going to lose

1013
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,836
more than your license!

1014
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,922
But that day is not today.

1015
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:55,967
Now, back in the closet,
where you belong.

1016
00:43:56,926 --> 00:44:00,472
It's not over, Quark!

1017
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:02,807
Don't make me come in there
after you.
