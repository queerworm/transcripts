00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:05,631
SISKO:
<i>Station Log, Stardate 46729.1.</i>

2
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:07,048
<i>The Bajoran government</i>
<i>has asked me</i>

3
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:09,092
<i>to mediate a disagreement</i>

4
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:12,179
<i>between two rival factions,</i>
<i>the Paqu and the Navot.</i>

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,806
<i>At issue is a land dispute</i>

6
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:16,851
<i>which could trigger</i>
<i>a civil war.</i>

7
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:20,020
Commander, the Paqu delegation
has arrived at Docking Port 6.

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,814
Let's welcome them aboard.

9
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:23,357
Dax, any word on the Navot?

10
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,400
They should be here
within the hour.

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,194
Excuse me, Commander.

12
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,655
Chief, I thought you'd be
on your way to Bajor by now.

13
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,657
We're due to leave
any moment.

14
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:33,241
But, sir,
I was wondering

15
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:36,077
if, perhaps, Ensign Boyer
might replace me

16
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,830
on this particular mission.

17
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,874
After all, I'd be little more
than a chauffeur

18
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,166
and Boyer can pilot
a runabout

19
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,334
just as well as I can.

20
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:44,169
Has something come up

21
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,171
that requires your presence
on the station, Chief?

22
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,841
No, sir. Everything's
running smoothly for a change.

23
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:50,801
But around here,
you never know.

24
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,803
Ah, Chief, there you are.
All set to go?

25
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,596
Yes, sir.

26
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,724
Commander, did the Magistrate
give any indication

27
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:58,767
as to the nature
of this medical emergency?

28
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,310
Only that
his village

29
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,270
was in danger of extinction.

30
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,147
In that case,
we'd better be on our way.

31
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,566
I agree.

32
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:06,608
Yes, sir.

33
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,818
Docking Port 6.

34
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,361
You know, Chief,
in a way

35
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,946
I'm really looking forward
to this mission.

36
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,447
And why is that?

37
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,866
Well, I see it
as a wonderful opportunity

38
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:14,950
for us to get
to know each other.

39
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,744
Oh.

40
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,167
I'd like you to set
a preliminary meeting

41
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,879
with both sides for
later this afternoon.

42
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,715
Make sure they know that
this is an informal session.

43
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:33,052
I just want to get them
talking to each other.

44
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:35,637
Just getting them to sit down
at the same table

45
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,431
will be an accomplishment.

46
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,809
Sir, about
these negotiations...

47
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,436
You have some
advice for me?

48
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,899
There's an old saying
on Bajor.

49
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,276
"The land and the people
are one."

50
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:52,738
Well, the land inhabited
by the Paqu and the Navot

51
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,907
is some of the harshest
on the planet.

52
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:56,575
Relax, Major.

53
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,994
This is not my first
time up at the plate.

54
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:00,913
Sir...

55
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:03,290
Besides, I'll have
you by my side

56
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,626
to help me avoid
making mistakes.

57
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,545
Tell me what you know
about the Paqu Tetrarch.

58
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,213
Not much.

59
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:13,383
The Paqu choose to avoid
contact with outsiders.

60
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,555
Commander Sisko?

61
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,057
Yes?

62
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:23,518
I am Varis Sul,
Tetrarch of the Paqu.

63
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:42,532
Chief, may I ask
you a question?

64
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,909
Of course.

65
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,660
And I'd like
an honest answer.

66
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,454
You'll get one.

67
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,957
Do I...

68
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,084
annoy you?

69
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,543
Annoy me?

70
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,045
What sort of a question
is that?

71
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,089
Well, the thing is,
we've just spent

72
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:59,174
the last two hours
alone together in
this runabout

73
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,135
and you've hardly
said a word to me
the whole time.

74
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,678
Really?
I hadn't noticed.

75
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,889
Oh, I see.

76
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,016
I suppose it's because
I was too busy thinking.

77
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,017
Thinking?

78
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,018
That's right.

79
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,103
About what?

80
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,520
What?

81
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,064
What were you
thinking about?

82
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,190
I'm just curious.

83
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,901
Well, let's see, um...

84
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,779
I was thinking that when
we get back to the station

85
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,031
I'll have to run
a level-1 diagnostic

86
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,659
on the phase coil generators.

87
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,368
Satisfied?

88
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,870
I suppose so.

89
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,455
Glad to hear it.

90
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,207
I mean, the only reason
I bring it up

91
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,792
is because your opinion
means a lot to me

92
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,418
and I'm aware that
I have a tendency

93
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,461
to run off at the
mouth sometimes.

94
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,921
Is that a fact?

95
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,547
I suppose it's just
a nervous habit.

96
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,175
I hope you don't
hold it against me.

97
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,509
Oh, not at all, sir.

98
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,637
And one more thing.

99
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,346
What's that, sir?

100
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:50,142
I don't think it's
really necessary

101
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:52,186
to call me "sir."

102
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,645
What should I call you?

103
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,272
You're my superior officer.

104
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,107
How about Julian?

105
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,609
Is that an order?

106
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,028
Oh, no, of course not.

107
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,071
It's just that I'd
simply prefer it

108
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,491
if you called me
by my first name.

109
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,535
All right.

110
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,629
We've achieved
stable orbit around Bajor.

111
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:23,050
We can beam down any time...

112
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,801
Julian.

113
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,693
BASHIR:
No sign
of any airborne infections.

114
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,820
The soil appears to be
free of pollutants

115
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,281
and the groundwater clear
of bacterial contamination.

116
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,824
Gentlemen.

117
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,035
I am Faren Kag,
the village magistrate.

118
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,620
I'm Dr. Bashir.
This is Chief O'Brien.

119
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,915
This village
is in great jeopardy.

120
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,251
I only hope
you're not too late.

121
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,259
Has he shown
any sign of improvement?

122
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,052
None.

123
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,847
You must help him.

124
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,473
How many others
are sick?

125
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,767
Others?

126
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,685
You said
the entire village

127
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:16,895
was in jeopardy.

128
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,688
It is.

129
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,441
If he dies,
we all die.

130
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,950
I'll say this
for the Cardassians--

131
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,953
their replicators
make a fine<i> larish</i> pie.

132
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,495
I didn't come here
to eat, Commander.

133
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,373
Then let's talk.

134
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,042
The official negotiations
don't begin until tonight

135
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,336
but I thought it
might be a good idea

136
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,880
that we meet informally
to see where we all stand.

137
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,673
According to the treaty

138
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,135
that has existed between you
for the past 90 years

139
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:51,179
"the border separating
the Paqu and the Navot

140
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,514
shall forever be
the river Glyrhond."

141
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,475
That's correct.

142
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,728
Well, at least
we all agree on something.

143
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,106
SISKO:
Now, as I understand it,
during the occupation

144
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,150
the Cardassians
diverted the river

145
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,235
for use
in their mining operations.

146
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,237
As a result,
the Glyrhond now flows

147
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,906
20 kilometers west
of its former position.

148
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,326
20 kilometers into
Navot territory.

149
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,328
That's Paqu territory now.

150
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:15,620
You read the treaty, Commander.

151
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,538
The river is
our common border.

152
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:20,417
The treaty says nothing
about stealing land.

153
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,169
If your father was alive

154
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:25,255
he would give us back
what is ours.

155
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,174
My father would do
no such thing.

156
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:30,218
Besides, I'm Tetrarch now.

157
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,221
I will not be pressured
into betraying my people.

158
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,765
QUARK:
Let's see...

159
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,352
two Bajoran synthales.

160
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:41,313
A glass of Gamzian wine

161
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:46,151
and a Trixian bubble juice
for the little lady.

162
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:49,529
I'm not a little lady.

163
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,289
I'm still charging her
for that drink.

164
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,599
Oh.

165
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,021
Nog, we've been sitting
here over an hour.

166
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,814
Let's go play some ball
in the holosuite.

167
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,024
No!

168
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,442
Why not?

169
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:28,860
Because baseball
is slow and boring.

170
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,320
And you can't hit
my curve ball.

171
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,155
It's a stupid game

172
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:35,116
that even humans stopped playing
hundreds of years ago.

173
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,660
Maybe, but you still
can't hit my curve ball.

174
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,414
Mr. Sisko, Nog,
I thought I told you

175
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:43,041
no dangling
over the Promenade.

176
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,043
We're not going
to fall, Odo.

177
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,087
We can see things
better from down here.

178
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,048
And what, may I ask,
is so interesting?

179
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,301
(<i> sighing</i> ):
Nothing.

180
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,803
In that case,
you can see "nothing"

181
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,597
just as well from up here.

182
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,600
Now, on your feet.

183
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,023
Thank you.

184
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,281
Are you going to come

185
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,199
to the holosuite
with me, or not?

186
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,909
Come on, we could have Buck
Bokai hit a few out to us.

187
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,370
He was the greatest
hitter of all time.

188
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,622
I'll even let you
use my glove.

189
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:26,460
I have never seen anything
so beautiful.

190
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,253
JAKE:
She's all right.

191
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,463
All right?

192
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,839
I have to meet her.

193
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,899
Ah! The Dal'Rok.

194
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,109
Easy now.

195
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,653
Try not
to exert yourself.

196
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,904
Huh? Hovath...

197
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,030
I'm here.
I'm right here.

198
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,574
The time...

199
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,493
It's still two hours
before nightfall.

200
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,369
You should have
wakened me.

201
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,037
Help me
to get dressed.

202
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:06,958
I'm afraid you're
in no shape to go anywhere.

203
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,295
The Prophets sent
you, didn't they?

204
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,213
I beg your pardon?

205
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,594
No, there's
something wrong.

206
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:20,888
It must be
your companion.

207
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,723
You mean Chief O'Brien?

208
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,309
Bring him to me.

209
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,644
Why?

210
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:28,229
Because you
are not the one

211
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,315
I have been waiting for.

212
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,941
Chief?

213
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,319
He wants to see you.

214
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,279
Come.

215
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:40,325
(<i> panting heavily</i> )

216
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,494
Closer.

217
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,876
Oh, I knew.

218
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:54,922
I knew the Prophets
would not fail us.

219
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,676
You may leave now.

220
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:59,844
Both of you.

221
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,516
See that he
stays in bed.

222
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,313
What was that
all about?

223
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:11,523
I haven't a clue.

224
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,191
The Sirah,
how is he?

225
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:14,693
I wish I had better news.

226
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,777
He's suffering
from systemic organ failure

227
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,322
brought on by an accelerated
rate of cellular decay.

228
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,616
His body is surrendering
to old age.

229
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:22,950
Is there anything
you can do?

230
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,244
I can keep him
comfortable

231
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,828
and relatively
free of pain.

232
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,288
Other than that,
it's just a matter of time.

233
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,373
I'm sorry.

234
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,624
But we need him.

235
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,501
The Dal'Rok will
be here soon.

236
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,045
O'BRIEN:
What's the Dal'Rok?

237
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,880
It's a terrible creature

238
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,716
that lives in the woods
just north of the village.

239
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:39,676
Every year at the end
of harvest, it appears.

240
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,053
And you say
it's coming here tonight?

241
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,555
Yes, it always comes
for five nights.

242
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:45,390
This will be the fourth--

243
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,101
and only the Sirah is
strong enough to defeat it.

244
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,728
Well, right now

245
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:52,939
the Sirah isn't strong enough
to get out of bed.

246
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,191
If what you say
is true

247
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,111
this village will be
destroyed tonight.

248
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,457
You're sure
this is the place?

249
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:11,832
You saw the readout.

250
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,876
There's only
one female her age

251
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,420
visiting the station

252
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,131
and these are
her quarters.

253
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,138
Well, go ahead.

254
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,139
What?

255
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,682
Ring the bell.

256
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,059
Me? You are the one
who wants to meet her.

257
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,185
Are you afraid?

258
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,228
Of a girl?

259
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,187
Then ring.

260
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,355
You ring!

261
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,814
You<i> are</i> afraid.

262
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,858
No, I'm not, you are.

263
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:41,780
What are
you doing?

264
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,907
My name's Jog...

265
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,701
I mean Jake.

266
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,119
I...

267
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,455
He's Nog.
I'm Jake Sisko.

268
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,875
Sisko...

269
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,586
JAKE:
We're kind of

270
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,713
the unofficial welcoming
committee around here.

271
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:01,382
That's right.

272
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,594
Welcome to DS9.

273
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,138
Thank you.
I'm Varis Sul.

274
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,182
JAKE:
Would you like a tour
of the station?

275
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,225
There's a Klingon freighter
leaving for the Gamma Quadrant

276
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,769
in a little while.

277
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,479
We could watch it
go through the wormhole.

278
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,230
Good-good-good idea.

279
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,856
Thanks.

280
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,233
So, how about it?

281
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,735
You want to go?

282
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,237
I've never seen
the wormhole.

283
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,947
Then you're in luck

284
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,367
'cause we know the best
spot on the station

285
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,076
for wormhole-watching.

286
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,371
Unless you're busy
or something.

287
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,414
Not at the moment.

288
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,884
BASHIR:
Listen to me, Sirah.

289
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,261
You must return to bed.

290
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:51,224
To be out here,
in your condition...

291
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,393
SIRAH:
Your concern touches me, Doctor

292
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:58,398
but I am now in the hands
of the Prophets.

293
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,774
WOMAN:
We believe in you.

294
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,108
MAN:
Help us, Sirah.

295
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,444
(<i> crowd murmuring</i> )

296
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,304
(<i> murmuring continues</i> )

297
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,931
Strange...

298
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,976
I'm not registering
any atmospheric disturbance.

299
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:39,856
The Dal'Rok wakes...

300
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:43,401
(<i> yelling</i> )

301
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:47,447
but we are ready.

302
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:51,200
(<i> yelling</i> )

303
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,246
In the shadow of the night,
he hungers.

304
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:59,292
With a hatred of the ancients,
he rages.

305
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:04,088
From the twisted pit of chaos,
he approaches.

306
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:08,259
(<i> ominous rumbling</i> )

307
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,180
Is it alive?

308
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,267
The tricorder's still
not picking up anything.

309
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,436
BASHIR:
Could it be some kind

310
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,438
of holographic image?

311
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:21,815
No.

312
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:25,985
I'm not picking up
any power source.

313
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,154
The Dal'Rok's anger

314
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:32,408
is like a wave crashing down
upon the village.

315
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:38,372
The weight of its fury
threatens to crush us all.

316
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:43,336
The Dal'Rok thinks the village
is powerless to defend itself...

317
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,547
(<i> yelling</i> )

318
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:53,387
but the Dal'Rok is mistaken.

319
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,140
The village is strong--

320
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:01,187
much stronger than the Dal'Rok
can ever imagine.

321
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,605
(<i> yelling in agreement</i> )

322
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,231
The village is strong!

323
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,361
The village is strong!

324
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,786
With our strength, our unity

325
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:20,164
we shall drive the Dal'Rok...

326
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,291
(<i> Sirah groans</i> )

327
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,460
(<i> crowd screaming and shouting)</i>

328
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,630
(<i> screaming</i> )

329
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,263
Bloody hell!

330
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:45,189
(<i> screaming</i> )

331
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,607
Chief!

332
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,276
Help us get him
down from here!

333
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,990
Where is my successor?

334
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,449
Sirah...

335
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,411
No. The one whom
the Prophets sent.

336
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,788
Yes, you.

337
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,957
W-wait a second.

338
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,125
I think you got
the wrong guy.

339
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,253
Say what I say.

340
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:11,049
The village shall
not be destroyed.

341
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,008
What?!

342
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,593
SIRAH:
Quickly.

343
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,470
The village
shall not be destroyed.

344
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,516
Louder, so they
can all hear.

345
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,351
The village

346
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,897
shall not
be destroyed!

347
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,774
Despite our fears

348
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,276
we shall
stand our ground

349
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,820
and face the Dal'Rok.

350
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,113
Despite our fears

351
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,867
we shall
stand our ground

352
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,369
and face the Dal'Rok.

353
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,372
(<i> yelling</i> )

354
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:47,418
SIRAH:
The village is strong.

355
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,378
(<i> shouting agreement</i> )

356
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,172
More powerful
than the Dal'Rok.

357
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:01,557
Together, we use that power

358
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,351
to drive it away.

359
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:11,358
CROWD:
Drive it away!
Drive it away!

360
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:20,952
(<i> whispering</i> )

361
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:22,829
The Dal'Rok is defeated.

362
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:26,916
(<i> cheering</i> )

363
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,502
The village is safe.

364
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,254
(<i> moans softly</i> )

365
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,098
He's dead.

366
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:52,984
The Sirah has left us

367
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,777
but the Prophets
have sent us

368
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,863
his successor.

369
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,035
A new Sirah
to tell the story.

370
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:04,037
(<i> cheering</i> )

371
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,705
Story, the story!

372
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,124
A new Sirah
to protect the village.

373
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:24,515
So I sold them a whole herd
of Klingon<i> targs.</i>

374
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:27,101
Major, what
a pleasant surprise.

375
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,477
I always look forward

376
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,730
to one of your
infrequent visits.

377
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,190
Spare me
the small talk

378
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,233
and get me
a stardrifter.

379
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,069
So, uh...

380
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,154
how are the negotiations
coming along?

381
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,491
Better make it
a double.

382
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,284
Ah.

383
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,166
You asked to see me?

384
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,127
Please, sit down.

385
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:56,047
I just spent
the last five hours sitting.

386
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:59,592
Yes, five long,
unproductive hours.

387
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,260
Woban is an obstinate fool.

388
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,762
Woban is here
to talk.

389
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,346
What are you
here for?

390
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,432
I would think
that was obvious--

391
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,893
to protect the interests
of my people.

392
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,310
How, by starting a war?

393
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,854
I object to your tone,
Commander.

394
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,564
Because if that's
what you're here for--

395
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,566
if you'd rather
fight than talk--

396
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,151
then we're just
wasting our time.

397
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,903
That land belongs to the Paqu.

398
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,529
The Navot don't agree.

399
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,199
Then they'd better be ready
to die for it.

400
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,534
I am.

401
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,078
Or don't you believe me?

402
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:28,871
I believe in people
working together

403
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,582
to find reasonable solutions
to their problems.

404
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,167
I hope you do as well.

405
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:36,003
What<i> you</i> hope
is no concern of mine.

406
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,756
Now, anything else
you wish to say to me

407
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:41,801
can be said tomorrow
across a conference table.

408
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,510
Varis...

409
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,639
are you sure your people
are as ready as you are

410
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,182
to die for that land?

411
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,445
NOG:
Where do you think she is?

412
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,031
I guess if she's not here,
we'll try again at her quarters.

413
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,825
When we find her,
let me do the talking.

414
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,701
She asked me questions,
I answered them.

415
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,036
What's wrong with that?

416
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,871
Just remember,
I saw her first.

417
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,623
She's mine.

418
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,792
Then how come you can barely
say two words to her

419
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:15,835
without getting
tongue-tied?

420
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,211
That's a lie!

421
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,088
I've never seen you
so nervous.

422
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,798
You must really like her.

423
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:22,800
I never said that!

424
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,718
All I said was...

425
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,887
(<i> stammering</i> )

426
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,848
We were just...

427
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,474
Looking for you.

428
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,726
I've been busy.

429
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,312
Is something
wrong?

430
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:37,231
You seem a little
depressed.

431
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:40,400
It's nothing, really.

432
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,778
It's just...

433
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:46,448
there are these people
who want something I have

434
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,868
and I refuse to give it to them.

435
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,954
How badly do they want it?

436
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,789
Very badly.

437
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,876
Is there anything they have
that you want?

438
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,669
That<i> I</i> want.

439
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,214
Maybe this isn't
a problem.

440
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,340
Maybe...

441
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,718
it's an opportunity.

442
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,261
Maybe.

443
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:10,223
When I have a problem
I can't figure out

444
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,640
I ask my dad.

445
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,351
I ask my dad, too.

446
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:16,103
It helps, doesn't it?

447
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,355
Yeah.

448
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:18,731
No.

449
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:19,899
My dad's

450
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,901
a pretty smart guy.

451
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:25,279
Mine, too...

452
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,365
in his own way.

453
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:30,326
My parents are dead.

454
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:33,704
They were killed
by the Cardassians.

455
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:36,123
I'm sorry.

456
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,624
My mom was killed

457
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,418
during an attack
by the Borg.

458
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:42,880
Isn't there someone
you can talk to?

459
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,131
Someone you trust?

460
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,799
I don't trust many people.

461
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,301
My dad says...

462
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,886
Could we please talk
about something

463
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:50,096
besides your father?

464
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:54,808
You admire him very much,
don't you?

465
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:55,935
I trust him.

466
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,353
ODO:
Mr. Sisko...

467
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:59,479
Odo.

468
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,481
We were
just leaving.

469
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:11,242
I wonder what was controlling
those energy creatures.

470
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:13,369
One thing's certain--
it wasn't me.

471
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,121
Try telling the villagers that.

472
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:17,081
They saw the Sirah choose you
as his successor.

473
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,874
Well, he made
a mistake.

474
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,542
You saw the way he greeted you
when we arrived.

475
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,836
It was as if he
was expecting you.

476
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,380
But I'll tell you this, Chief

477
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,672
I'm glad you came along
on this mission

478
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,425
because if it wasn't for you

479
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:28,968
I'd have done what I could
for the Sirah and left

480
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,719
and look what I
would have missed.

481
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,013
Well, I'm glad you're
enjoying yourself,<i> Julian.</i>

482
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,641
Don't worry, Chief,
I have faith in you.

483
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:36,767
Oh,<i> do</i> you?!

484
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:39,061
I mean, for all we know

485
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,063
you really were sent
by the Prophets.

486
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:43,565
I was sent by
Commander Sisko.

487
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:46,110
This Dal'Rok, or whatever

488
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,903
will be returning this evening

489
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,197
and everybody's counting
on me to be able to stop it.

490
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,116
The only trouble is

491
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:55,619
I don't have the slightest idea
how I'm supposed to do that.

492
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,912
(<i> door opens</i> )

493
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,915
These gifts are for you, Sirah.

494
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,792
Well, look,
tell them I don't want them.

495
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,085
Oh, bring them in.

496
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:04,837
Put them wherever you like.

497
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,176
Now, look, Julian...

498
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:11,927
We have visitors
here, Chief.

499
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,720
It would be impolite
to refuse our hosts.

500
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,265
MAN:
Thank you, Sirah.

501
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:22,688
How can I help you,
ladies?

502
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:27,485
I think they're the ones
offering services, Chief.

503
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:29,445
Now, look,
t-there's been

504
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,155
a serious
misunderstanding.

505
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:33,073
Is there a
problem, Sirah?

506
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,616
No! They're not...

507
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,743
Well, yes...

508
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,497
I mean,
they're quite...

509
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:42,958
Look, I have a wife
and daughter back on DS9.

510
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,877
Of course.

511
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,672
You must send for them.

512
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:49,965
Why?

513
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:53,344
So they can live
here with you.

514
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:54,678
No, you're missing
the point.

515
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,138
I'm not staying.

516
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:58,391
Then, who will tell the story?

517
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:02,311
Well, you'll just
have to find someone else.

518
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,729
But there is no one else.

519
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:04,980
The Sirah chose you.

520
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,232
He made a mistake.

521
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,067
But what about
the Dal'Rok?

522
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,776
Without your protection,
it will kill us all.

523
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,696
Faren, I would like
to help, really I would

524
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,698
but I don't know how.

525
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,700
You must tell the story.

526
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,911
Simple as that,
is it?

527
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:24,041
May the Prophets
grant you victory, Sirah.

528
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:25,876
Let's hope so.

529
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:40,766
(<i> sighs</i> )

530
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,060
Now what are we
going to do?

531
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,728
The way I see it

532
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,688
the only way
out of this mess

533
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:50,650
is to find out exactly
what this Dal'Rok is

534
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:54,447
and destroy it
before it destroys us.

535
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:00,411
SISKO:
<i>Station Log, supplemental.</i>

536
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:02,538
<i>We have completed</i>
<i>a second day of talks</i>

537
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,373
<i>between the Paqu and the Navot.</i>

538
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,833
<i>So far, we're no closer</i>
<i>to finding a solution</i>

539
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:10,045
<i>than we were</i>
<i>when negotiations began.</i>

540
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,507
(<i> door chimes</i> )

541
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:15,633
Enter.

542
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:18,929
Hi. You want
to do something?

543
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,432
Sorry, not right now.

544
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:26,270
Okay, we'll
stop by later.

545
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,481
Is there anything
we can do

546
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:30,316
to cheer you up?

547
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,526
I don't think so.

548
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,487
You sure?

549
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:36,530
Let's go before
you embarrass yourself.

550
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,573
Wait.

551
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,158
Yes?

552
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:43,912
Do you remember
that opportunity

553
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,582
we were discussing
yesterday?

554
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,208
Yes.

555
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,793
How can you be sure

556
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,630
that an opportunity
is worth the risk?

557
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,215
Ah. Instinct.

558
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:58,051
The Ninth Rule of Acquisition
clearly states

559
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:02,556
that opportunity plus instinct
equals profit.

560
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,766
Instinct...

561
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,186
That's not going
to help.

562
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,062
I think it does.

563
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,064
Thank you, Nog.

564
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,316
Good!

565
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:15,027
Let's celebrate.

566
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,570
Celebrate?

567
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,280
I took one
of my uncle's security rods.

568
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,698
What are we going
to do with that?

569
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,034
I don't know.

570
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,286
We could swipe
Odo's bucket.

571
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:25,245
Are you kidding?

572
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,539
A bucket?

573
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:27,705
Yeah.
We'll give it back.

574
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:28,666
Yeah, but...

575
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,083
It'll be funny.

576
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,751
But we can't just walk
into Security.

577
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,504
Watch me.

578
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:35,631
(<i> laughing</i> )

579
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:50,521
Wait over there.

580
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:54,233
I still don't understand
what's so funny about a bucket.

581
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,359
Odo lives in it.

582
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,443
He's a shape-shifter.

583
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,153
Every 16 hours

584
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,447
he has to change back
to his original form.

585
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,823
Inside a bucket?

586
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,743
He turns into
some kind of liquid.

587
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,250
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

588
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,585
Watch the front door.

589
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:13,877
I'll be right back.

590
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:22,511
Jake, are you sure
this is all right?

591
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:26,265
Well, it's not like we're
really stealing anything.

592
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,642
NOG:
Found it.

593
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:30,310
Oops!

594
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,104
Odo!

595
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:34,732
Odo!

596
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,444
It's oatmeal.

597
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:41,614
I filled it
from the replicator.

598
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:44,366
Very funny!

599
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,912
You should have seen your face.

600
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:11,184
I believe that belongs to me.

601
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,068
What's the rush?

602
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,805
There's some residual
neutrino levels

603
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:49,473
in the microstructure
of these rocks.

604
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,183
But if the Dal'Rok has
no physical substance

605
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,268
how can it leave
a neutrino trace?

606
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,771
I didn't say it made sense,
but this rock face

607
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:58,315
didn't just spontaneously
blow itself to pieces.

608
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:00,275
Lucky for us, you
managed to stop it

609
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,985
before it did
any more damage.

610
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,655
All I did was repeat
what the Sirah told me.

611
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:06,782
In that case, how did the
Sirah manage to stop it?

612
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,826
Good question.

613
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:11,244
Maybe there's
a control mechanism

614
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,287
hidden somewhere.

615
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,622
Excuse me, miss.

616
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,248
Please, Sirah,
for my daughter.

617
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,916
What about her?

618
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:20,587
It looks like
she wants you to
bless her child.

619
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:21,797
Me?!

620
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:24,883
It would mean so much.

621
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:34,643
I'm sure she'll make
you very proud.

622
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:35,769
Oh, thank you.

623
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:36,770
Thank you.

624
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:37,855
MAN:
There he is.

625
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:39,356
You're quite welcome.

626
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:40,691
Looks like more
of your followers

627
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:41,817
are requesting an audience.

628
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,360
Oh, no.
This won't do.

629
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,737
Um, you continue
looking around here.

630
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:46,655
I'm going to check
the Sirah's room.

631
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:47,656
Please, please.

632
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:48,990
I'm afraid the Sirah

633
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,785
is busy at the moment.

634
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:53,704
Perhaps I could be
of service.

635
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:55,163
MAN:
Sirah, come back!

636
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,749
WOMAN:
Please, Sirah, a moment.

637
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,298
(<i> sighs</i> )

638
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:28,572
Look, I could use
some privacy.

639
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:32,158
There are more gifts
outside for you.

640
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,953
All right, bring them in.

641
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,747
Hold on.

642
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:39,165
Didn't you work
for the Sirah?

643
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,667
Mm-hmm.

644
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,210
I, um...

645
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,045
I was his apprentice.

646
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:48,801
Oh. Did he ever reveal
any of his secrets?

647
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:52,053
How he controlled the Dal'Rok
and that sort of thing?

648
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,555
Why ask me?

649
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:56,349
Surely, the Sirah
must have taught you

650
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,935
all you need to know.

651
00:32:57,935 --> 00:32:59,060
Oh, all right!

652
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,395
Have it your way.

653
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,106
Don't blame me
when that creature

654
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:06,151
goes rampaging
through your village.

655
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:14,785
Chief!

656
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,580
Careful.

657
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,081
Don't hurt him.

658
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,083
I'll try not to.

659
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,253
That's enough.

660
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,588
Tell him that.

661
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,800
I said, that's enough!

662
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:37,975
Now, you mind explaining
why you tried to kill me?

663
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:45,315
You are not the true Sirah.

664
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:48,026
You won't get any
argument from me.

665
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:51,029
If he isn't, who is?

666
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,406
I am.

667
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:08,254
For nine years,
I studied with the Sirah

668
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:11,299
learning the secrets
of the storyteller

669
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:18,181
only to have you come
along and take my place.

670
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,308
Look, friend,
as far as I'm concerned

671
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,894
the job's yours.

672
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:23,603
But if you were
supposed to take over

673
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,063
how come the Sirah
chose him?

674
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,732
It was his way
of punishing me.

675
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:29,192
Punishing you?

676
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,777
Three nights ago

677
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,030
the Sirah allowed me
to tell the story

678
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:36,909
but when the Dal'Rok appeared,
I was unable to control it.

679
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,118
Several people were injured.

680
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,747
Control it, how?

681
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,707
With this.

682
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:46,001
This stone is said to be
a fragment of an Orb

683
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:47,794
from the Celestial Temple.

684
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,338
We had one of those Orbs
aboard our station.

685
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,216
We're aware
of how powerful they are.

686
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:57,136
Many years ago, this village
was deeply divided

687
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,972
by hate and mistrust.

688
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:02,267
The first Sirah knew
that unless he could find a way

689
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:03,936
to unite the people

690
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:05,645
the village
would destroy itself

691
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:09,066
so he used the Orb fragment
as a catalyst

692
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:11,944
to give their fears
a physical form.

693
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:15,447
So the villagers' thoughts
create the Dal'Rok.

694
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:18,575
Yes, but they don't know that.

695
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:22,829
It's a secret which is passed
from Sirah to Sirah.

696
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,373
Why do they need
a storyteller?

697
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,293
The story helps to focus
the villagers' thoughts.

698
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,963
And that enables them
to defeat the Dal'Rok

699
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:33,090
by creating
the shimmering lights.

700
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:38,303
I know, if I had another chance,
I could control the Dal'Rok.

701
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,431
Well, son

702
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:43,058
it looks like tonight

703
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,102
you are going
to get that chance.

704
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:47,020
(<i> chuckling</i> )

705
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,945
What is this?

706
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:56,947
You have no right
to wear those clothes.

707
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:58,531
I have every right.

708
00:35:58,531 --> 00:35:59,825
You had your chance
to prove yourself.

709
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:00,909
You failed.

710
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,201
It won't happen again.

711
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,495
That's right--

712
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,038
because you won't be allowed

713
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:06,957
to endanger the village
a second time.

714
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:08,625
Now take off those robes!

715
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,298
Now, hold on.

716
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,800
Sirah...

717
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,136
it's time you were
getting ready.

718
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:20,679
The people will be assembling
soon to hear the story.

719
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,557
(<i> sighs</i> )

720
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:38,571
I want you to know,
Commander,

721
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,281
that I take
complete responsibility

722
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,408
for what happened
in the Security Office.

723
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,828
I think that there's
more than enough blame

724
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,079
to spread around.

725
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,747
Jake should have known better.

726
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,415
I'm afraid he and Nog

727
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:52,502
were just trying
to impress me.

728
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:55,172
That's not much
of an excuse.

729
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:57,007
Didn't you ever do
anything foolish

730
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:58,424
to impress a girl?

731
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,385
I may have.

732
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,220
Jake's a nice boy.

733
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,307
So is Nog... in his own way.

734
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,351
I enjoy their company.

735
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,562
I suppose you don't get
much of a chance

736
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,271
to be with people your age.

737
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:15,316
True, but...

738
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,444
that's not why I wanted
to be with them.

739
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:23,075
I wanted to learn about you.

740
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:24,868
And?

741
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:28,246
Jake speaks very
highly of you.

742
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,664
He trusts you.

743
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,209
That's always nice to hear.

744
00:37:34,044 --> 00:37:36,379
Hearing Jake speak of you...

745
00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:41,676
reminded me of how much
I miss my own parents.

746
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,513
My father was a great man.

747
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,390
A<i> great</i> leader.

748
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,642
I'm sure he'd be
very proud of you.

749
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,394
I try to be strong

750
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:54,355
the way he was strong, but...

751
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,526
it's difficult.

752
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,570
From what I've learned
of your father

753
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,321
he wasn't afraid to compromise.

754
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:05,742
That's because he knew
the Navot feared him.

755
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:09,079
If I were to make concessions,
Woban would think I was weak.

756
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:11,123
I doubt he would be
that foolish

757
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:13,750
but he is determined
to get that land back.

758
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:17,462
I am<i> not</i> afraid
of Woban<i> or</i> the Navot.

759
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:19,589
I never said you were.

760
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:23,843
So your answer is still no.

761
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,512
You don't lose by saying no.

762
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,973
Maybe

763
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:30,892
but a great leader
like your father

764
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:34,687
is one who's willing
to risk saying yes.

765
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:47,700
Commander...

766
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,829
I believe I know of...

767
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,580
an opportunity...

768
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:56,501
that could allow both sides
to say yes.

769
00:38:56,501 --> 00:39:00,713
(<i> crowd murmuring excitedly</i> )

770
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:10,389
MAN:
Sirah, you'll save us.

771
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,267
I thought you
wanted this job.

772
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,685
I do.

773
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:16,604
Then, why don't you
fight for it?

774
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,523
No, Faren is right.

775
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:22,401
These people will never
accept me as Sirah.

776
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:24,279
Without their support

777
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:27,406
I could never control
the Dal'Rok.

778
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,575
You think I can?

779
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:32,162
You have to.

780
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:33,997
Oh, Chief.

781
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,458
Good luck.

782
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:53,099
(<i> crowd clamoring</i> )

783
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,726
Tell us the story!

784
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,937
Sirah, the story!

785
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,773
(<i> clamoring continues</i> )

786
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:06,196
Once upon a time...

787
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:08,907
there was a Dal'Rok

788
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:13,245
and it lives there, in the woods

789
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:16,581
and he hated
the village

790
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,542
and all of the villagers

791
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:24,047
and he wanted
to see them destroyed.

792
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:26,549
The Dal'Rok is here!

793
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:31,012
Yes! The Dal'Rok is here

794
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:33,598
and it's hungry

795
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:37,269
but the village
is prepared to fight

796
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:39,854
like it has always fought--

797
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,982
with the lights,
the shimmering lights.

798
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,985
Something's wrong.

799
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:50,031
What's wrong is
that O'Brien is
not the Sirah--

800
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:51,366
you are.

801
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:52,617
O'BRIEN:
Come on, you can do it!

802
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:55,703
The village is strong

803
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:59,624
and unafraid...
and... powerful

804
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:03,211
and ready to face the Dal'Rok.

805
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:06,547
Do you think that maybe
the Sirah planned all this?

806
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,634
He knew the villagers
had lost confidence in you

807
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:11,886
so he chose O'Brien
as his successor

808
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,721
knowing that you would
have to rescue him.

809
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,473
Don't you see--

810
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,976
this is your chance to
prove once and for all

811
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,144
that you are
the true Sirah.

812
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,853
All right now...

813
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:24,565
let's really focus
and send this one out, okay?

814
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:28,069
Let's really send
the Dal'Rok a message.

815
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:31,781
Where the hell are those lights?

816
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,078
(<i> groans</i> )

817
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:40,165
(<i> crowd screaming</i> )

818
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:48,673
Wait!

819
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:50,925
There is no need
to run!

820
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,760
A new voice appears

821
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,472
to challenge the Dal'Rok!

822
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:56,889
It's about time.

823
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:59,476
The Dal'Rok
is a fearsome enemy.

824
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:01,853
The mountains tremble
with its fury

825
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:06,649
but our prosperity
is its misery

826
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:09,902
our unity is its vulnerability

827
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:13,531
and our strength
is its doom.

828
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:17,952
Look-- the Dal'Rok trembles!

829
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:21,539
It fears our strength.

830
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,834
It fears
our determination.

831
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:29,922
It knows
it cannot stand against us

832
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:32,758
because the village
is united.

833
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,760
We are as one.

834
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,565
You see

835
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,401
for yourselves.

836
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:52,487
The Dal'Rok is defeated.

837
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:55,573
This village is safe
for another year.

838
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,492
(<i> crowd cheering</i> )

839
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,536
The Sirah! The Sirah!

840
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:04,332
Let's get out of here
before they change their minds.

841
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:06,418
Sirah!
Sirah!
Sirah!

842
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:11,214
(<i> crowd clamor continues</i> )

843
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:13,632
Hail the Sirah.

844
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,764
Nervous?

845
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:22,225
Not at all.

846
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:23,809
Maybe a little.

847
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,062
Do you think Woban
will accept my proposal?

848
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:27,605
It's very possible.

849
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,982
It would give the Navot
back their land.

850
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:33,027
And free trade access
to both sides of the river

851
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,820
would mean a lot
to my people.

852
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,822
It's a reasonable
compromise.

853
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,412
We thought we'd wish you luck
with your meeting.

854
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:44,247
Thank you...

855
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:53,172
...for all your help.

856
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:58,886
All right, let's go.

857
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:02,140
You two are going
to clean the Security Office

858
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,975
until it shines.

859
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,644
You know, Chief

860
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,187
this is going to make
a fantastic story

861
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,397
to tell around the station.

862
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:11,107
Not for me.

863
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:13,276
I've had my fill of storytelling
for the time being.

864
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:15,445
Well, I hope you don't
mind if I mention it.

865
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:17,947
Suit yourself... Julian.

866
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:20,283
Oh, and, Chief,
on second thought...

867
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:23,620
you don't really have
to call me Julian.

868
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:27,624
Right you are... sir.
