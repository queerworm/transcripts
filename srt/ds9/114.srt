1
00:00:02,196 --> 00:00:05,829
Station Log, Stardate 46729.1.

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,601
The Bajoran government
has asked me

3
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:08,904
to mediate a disagreement

4
00:00:08,943 --> 00:00:12,438
between two rival factions,
the Paqu and the Navot.

5
00:00:12,483 --> 00:00:14,180
At issue is a land dispute

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,315
which could trigger
a civil war.

7
00:00:16,357 --> 00:00:20,354
Commander, the Paqu delegation
has arrived at Docking Port 6.

8
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:21,959
Let's welcome them aboard.

9
00:00:22,002 --> 00:00:23,665
Dax, any word on the Navot?

10
00:00:23,706 --> 00:00:25,869
They should be here
within the hour.

11
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,208
Excuse me, Commander.

12
00:00:27,313 --> 00:00:29,876
Chief, I thought you'd be
on your way to Bajor by now.

13
00:00:29,918 --> 00:00:31,854
We're due to leave any moment.

14
00:00:31,889 --> 00:00:33,518
But, sir, I was wondering

15
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:36,360
if, perhaps, Ensign Boyer
might replace me

16
00:00:36,397 --> 00:00:38,230
on this particular mission.

17
00:00:38,268 --> 00:00:40,238
After all, I'd be little more
than a chauffeur

18
00:00:40,272 --> 00:00:42,903
and Boyer can pilot a runabout
just as well as I can.

19
00:00:42,944 --> 00:00:44,242
Has something come up

20
00:00:44,347 --> 00:00:46,510
that requires your presence
on the station, Chief?

21
00:00:46,552 --> 00:00:49,045
No, sir. Everything's
running smoothly for a change.

22
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,117
But around here, you never know.

23
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,460
Ah, Chief, there you are.
All set to go?

24
00:00:53,498 --> 00:00:54,591
Yes, sir.

25
00:00:54,634 --> 00:00:57,002
Commander, did the Magistrate
give any indication

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,202
as to the nature
of this medical emergency?

27
00:00:59,243 --> 00:01:02,613
Only that his village
was in danger of extinction.

28
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,381
In that case,
we'd better be on our way.

29
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,752
I agree.

30
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:06,758
Yes, sir.

31
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:07,885
Docking Port 6.

32
00:01:07,927 --> 00:01:08,986
You know, Chief, in a way

33
00:01:09,029 --> 00:01:11,226
I'm really looking forward
to this mission.

34
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:12,428
And why is that?

35
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:13,960
Well, I see it
as a wonderful opportunity

36
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:15,235
for us to get
to know each other.

37
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,766
Oh.

38
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,526
I'd like you to set
a preliminary meeting

39
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,053
with both sides
for later this afternoon.

40
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:29,969
Make sure they know that this
is an informal session.

41
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:32,533
I just want to get them
talking to each other.

42
00:01:32,576 --> 00:01:35,810
Just getting them to sit down
at the same table

43
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,683
will be an accomplishment.

44
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,056
Sir, about these negotiations...

45
00:01:41,093 --> 00:01:42,561
You have some advice for me?

46
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,070
There's an old saying on Bajor.

47
00:01:47,105 --> 00:01:49,575
"The land and the people
are one."

48
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:52,947
Well, the land inhabited
by the Paqu and the Navot

49
00:01:52,984 --> 00:01:55,477
is some of the harshest
on the planet.

50
00:01:55,522 --> 00:01:56,683
Relax, Major.

51
00:01:56,725 --> 00:01:59,322
This is not my first time
up at the plate.

52
00:01:59,363 --> 00:02:01,333
Sir...

53
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:03,530
Besides, I'll have you
by my side

54
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:05,803
to help me avoid
making mistakes.

55
00:02:05,843 --> 00:02:09,009
Tell me what you know
about the Paqu Tetrarch.

56
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:10,278
Not much.

57
00:02:10,352 --> 00:02:13,483
The Paqu choose to avoid
contact with outsiders.

58
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:18,896
Commander Sisko?

59
00:02:18,936 --> 00:02:20,029
Yes?

60
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:23,602
I am Varis Sul,
Tetrarch of the Paqu.

61
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:43,091
Chief, may I ask you a question?

62
00:04:43,128 --> 00:04:44,289
Of course.

63
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,232
And I'd like an honest answer.

64
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:48,066
You'll get one.

65
00:04:48,105 --> 00:04:50,473
Do I...

66
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:52,502
annoy you?

67
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,516
Annoy me?

68
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,213
What sort of a question
is that?

69
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,688
Well, the thing is,
we've just spent

70
00:04:57,723 --> 00:04:59,693
the last two hours alone
together in this runabout

71
00:04:59,727 --> 00:05:01,754
and you've hardly said
a word to me the whole time.

72
00:05:01,798 --> 00:05:03,631
Really?
I hadn't noticed.

73
00:05:03,668 --> 00:05:06,367
Oh, I see.

74
00:05:06,408 --> 00:05:08,640
I suppose it's because
I was too busy thinking.

75
00:05:08,678 --> 00:05:09,771
Thinking?

76
00:05:09,815 --> 00:05:10,908
That's right.

77
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,918
About what?

78
00:05:11,952 --> 00:05:12,920
What?

79
00:05:12,954 --> 00:05:14,480
What were you thinking about?

80
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,751
I'm just curious.

81
00:05:15,793 --> 00:05:18,356
Well, let's see, um...

82
00:05:18,398 --> 00:05:21,302
I was thinking that when
we get back to the station

83
00:05:21,337 --> 00:05:23,466
I'll have to run
a level-1 diagnostic

84
00:05:23,508 --> 00:05:26,173
on the phase coil generators.

85
00:05:26,214 --> 00:05:27,979
Satisfied?

86
00:05:28,018 --> 00:05:29,350
I suppose so.

87
00:05:29,387 --> 00:05:31,254
Glad to hear it.

88
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,782
I mean, the only reason
I bring it up

89
00:05:32,827 --> 00:05:34,524
is because your opinion
means a lot to me

90
00:05:34,564 --> 00:05:35,964
and I'm aware
that I have a tendency

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,366
to run off at the mouth
sometimes.

92
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,371
Is that a fact?

93
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,068
I suppose it's just
a nervous habit.

94
00:05:40,109 --> 00:05:41,806
I hope you don't
hold it against me.

95
00:05:41,846 --> 00:05:43,007
Oh, not at all, sir.

96
00:05:44,852 --> 00:05:46,252
And one more thing.

97
00:05:46,287 --> 00:05:48,154
What's that, sir?

98
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:50,684
I don't think
it's really necessary

99
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:52,699
to call me "sir."

100
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:54,259
What should I call you?

101
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,966
You're my superior officer.

102
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:57,498
How about Julian?

103
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,248
Is that an order?

104
00:06:00,282 --> 00:06:01,375
Oh, no, of course not.

105
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:03,785
It's just that I'd
simply prefer it

106
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,122
if you called me
by my first name.

107
00:06:06,161 --> 00:06:09,497
All right.

108
00:06:16,714 --> 00:06:20,175
We've achieved
stable orbit around Bajor.

109
00:06:20,222 --> 00:06:23,524
We can beam down any time...

110
00:06:23,562 --> 00:06:25,225
Julian.

111
00:06:38,792 --> 00:06:41,764
No sign
of any airborne infections.

112
00:06:41,798 --> 00:06:44,395
The soil appears to be
free of pollutants

113
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,238
and the groundwater clear
of bacterial contamination.

114
00:06:47,276 --> 00:06:48,403
Gentlemen.

115
00:06:48,445 --> 00:06:50,847
I am Faren Kag,
the village magistrate.

116
00:06:50,882 --> 00:06:53,250
I'm Dr. Bashir.
This is Chief O'Brien.

117
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,520
This village
is in great jeopardy.

118
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:57,620
I only hope you're not too late.

119
00:07:03,241 --> 00:07:05,872
Has he shown
any sign of improvement?

120
00:07:05,912 --> 00:07:07,403
None.

121
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:11,388
You must help him.

122
00:07:11,424 --> 00:07:13,223
How many others are sick?

123
00:07:13,261 --> 00:07:14,229
Others?

124
00:07:14,263 --> 00:07:17,394
You said the entire village
was in jeopardy.

125
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:19,235
It is.

126
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,938
If he dies, we all die.

127
00:07:28,224 --> 00:07:30,524
I'll say this
for the Cardassians...

128
00:07:30,562 --> 00:07:33,591
their replicators
make a fine <i>larish</i> pie.

129
00:07:33,635 --> 00:07:35,366
I didn't come here
to eat, Commander.

130
00:07:35,405 --> 00:07:36,999
Then let's talk.

131
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:39,570
The official negotiations
don't begin until tonight

132
00:07:39,613 --> 00:07:42,015
but I thought it
might be a good idea

133
00:07:42,052 --> 00:07:44,649
that we meet informally
to see where we all stand.

134
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:46,225
According to the treaty

135
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,662
that has existed between you
for the past 90 years

136
00:07:48,698 --> 00:07:51,761
"the border separating
the Paqu and the Navot

137
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,172
shall forever be
the river Glyrhond."

138
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,873
That's correct.

139
00:07:57,516 --> 00:07:59,247
Well, at least
we all agree on something.

140
00:07:59,286 --> 00:08:01,586
Now, as I understand it,
during the occupation

141
00:08:01,624 --> 00:08:03,617
the Cardassians
diverted the river

142
00:08:03,695 --> 00:08:05,756
for use
in their mining operations.

143
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:07,894
As a result,
the Glyrhond now flows

144
00:08:07,936 --> 00:08:10,499
20 kilometers west
of its former position.

145
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:13,012
20 kilometers
into Navot territory.

146
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:14,778
That's Paqu territory now.

147
00:08:14,817 --> 00:08:16,080
You read the treaty, Commander.

148
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,286
The river is our common border.

149
00:08:19,326 --> 00:08:22,298
The treaty says nothing
about stealing land.

150
00:08:22,332 --> 00:08:23,995
If your father was alive

151
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,665
he would give us back
what is ours.

152
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,674
My father would do
no such thing.

153
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:30,681
Besides, I'm Tetrarch now.

154
00:08:30,749 --> 00:08:33,983
I will not be pressured
into betraying my people.

155
00:08:34,023 --> 00:08:36,323
Let's see...

156
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,991
two Bajoran synthales

157
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:41,834
a glass of Gamzian wine

158
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:46,677
and a Trixian bubble juice
for the little lady.

159
00:08:46,714 --> 00:08:50,050
I'm not a little lady.

160
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:59,666
I'm still charging her
for that drink.

161
00:09:17,743 --> 00:09:19,075
Oh.

162
00:09:21,951 --> 00:09:23,648
Nog, we've been sitting
here over an hour.

163
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,351
Let's go play some ball
in the holosuite.

164
00:09:25,392 --> 00:09:26,519
No!

165
00:09:26,561 --> 00:09:27,859
Why not?

166
00:09:27,896 --> 00:09:29,525
Because baseball
is slow and boring.

167
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:31,196
And you can't hit
my curve ball.

168
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,535
It's a stupid game

169
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:35,670
that even humans stopped playing
hundreds of years ago.

170
00:09:35,712 --> 00:09:38,548
Maybe, but you still
can't hit my curve ball.

171
00:09:38,585 --> 00:09:41,318
Mr. Sisko, Nog,
I thought I told you

172
00:09:41,357 --> 00:09:43,885
no dangling over the Promenade.

173
00:09:43,928 --> 00:09:45,761
We're not going to fall, Odo.

174
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:48,065
We can see things
better from down here.

175
00:09:48,104 --> 00:09:52,408
And what, may I ask,
is so interesting?

176
00:09:52,446 --> 00:09:54,245
Nothing.

177
00:09:54,283 --> 00:09:56,583
In that case,
you can see "nothing"

178
00:09:56,621 --> 00:09:58,420
just as well from up here.

179
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,294
Now, on your feet.

180
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,631
Thank you.

181
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,122
Are you going to come

182
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:15,716
to the holosuite
with me, or not?

183
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:18,754
Come on, we could have Buck
Bokai hit a few out to us.

184
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:21,361
He was the greatest
hitter of all time.

185
00:10:21,404 --> 00:10:23,465
I'll even let you use my glove.

186
00:10:23,508 --> 00:10:26,186
I have never seen anything
so beautiful.

187
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:28,516
She's all right.

188
00:10:28,557 --> 00:10:29,786
All right?

189
00:10:29,826 --> 00:10:31,989
I have to meet her.

190
00:10:48,363 --> 00:10:50,162
Ah! The Dal'Rok.

191
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,327
Easy now.

192
00:10:51,369 --> 00:10:54,000
Try not to exert yourself.

193
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,339
Huh? Hovath...

194
00:10:55,377 --> 00:10:56,675
I'm here.
I'm right here.

195
00:10:56,713 --> 00:10:57,772
The time...

196
00:10:57,815 --> 00:10:59,944
It's still two hours
before nightfall.

197
00:10:59,986 --> 00:11:01,785
You should have wakened me.

198
00:11:01,823 --> 00:11:03,291
Help me to get dressed.

199
00:11:03,327 --> 00:11:07,290
I'm afraid you're
in no shape to go anywhere.

200
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:10,466
The Prophets sent you,
didn't they?

201
00:11:10,507 --> 00:11:11,770
I beg your pardon?

202
00:11:14,182 --> 00:11:17,986
No, there's something wrong.

203
00:11:18,022 --> 00:11:21,153
It must be your companion.

204
00:11:21,196 --> 00:11:22,995
You mean Chief O'Brien?

205
00:11:23,032 --> 00:11:24,500
Bring him to me.

206
00:11:24,535 --> 00:11:26,003
Why?

207
00:11:26,038 --> 00:11:30,673
Because you are not the one
I have been waiting for.

208
00:11:30,714 --> 00:11:32,182
Chief?

209
00:11:32,218 --> 00:11:34,688
He wants to see you.

210
00:11:34,722 --> 00:11:36,715
Come.

211
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:42,727
Closer.

212
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,051
Oh, I knew.

213
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:55,222
I knew the Prophets
would not fail us.

214
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:57,997
You may leave now.

215
00:11:58,035 --> 00:12:00,028
Both of you.

216
00:12:02,043 --> 00:12:04,536
See that he stays in bed.

217
00:12:09,358 --> 00:12:10,690
What was that all about?

218
00:12:10,727 --> 00:12:11,854
I haven't a clue.

219
00:12:11,896 --> 00:12:13,364
The Sirah, how is he?

220
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,029
I wish I had better news.

221
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:17,062
He's suffering
from systemic organ failure

222
00:12:17,106 --> 00:12:19,669
brought on by an accelerated
rate of cellular decay.

223
00:12:19,712 --> 00:12:22,046
His body is surrendering
to old age.

224
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,312
Is there anything you can do?

225
00:12:23,353 --> 00:12:24,378
I can keep him comfortable

226
00:12:24,422 --> 00:12:25,583
and relatively free of pain.

227
00:12:25,624 --> 00:12:27,423
Other than that,
it's just a matter of time.

228
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:28,553
I'm sorry.

229
00:12:28,597 --> 00:12:29,724
But we need him.

230
00:12:29,765 --> 00:12:31,530
The Dal'Rok will be here soon.

231
00:12:33,172 --> 00:12:34,698
What's the Dal'Rok?

232
00:12:34,742 --> 00:12:36,142
It's a terrible creature

233
00:12:36,178 --> 00:12:38,011
that lives in the woods
just north of the village.

234
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,041
Every year at the end
of harvest, it appears.

235
00:12:40,086 --> 00:12:42,386
And you say
it's coming here tonight?

236
00:12:42,424 --> 00:12:43,915
Yes, it always comes
for five nights.

237
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,451
This will be the fourth...

238
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,661
and only the Sirah is
strong enough to defeat it.

239
00:12:48,703 --> 00:12:49,966
Well, right now

240
00:12:50,006 --> 00:12:53,274
the Sirah isn't strong enough
to get out of bed.

241
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:55,442
If what you say is true

242
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:58,251
this village will be
destroyed tonight.

243
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,771
You're sure this is the place?

244
00:13:10,814 --> 00:13:12,146
You saw the readout.

245
00:13:12,183 --> 00:13:15,782
There's only one female her age
visiting the station

246
00:13:15,824 --> 00:13:18,226
and these are her quarters.

247
00:13:23,907 --> 00:13:25,467
Well, go ahead.

248
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,705
What?

249
00:13:26,746 --> 00:13:27,839
Ring the bell.

250
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:30,283
Me? You are the one
who wants to meet her.

251
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,618
Are you afraid?

252
00:13:31,656 --> 00:13:32,624
Of a girl?

253
00:13:32,658 --> 00:13:33,626
Then ring.

254
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,650
You ring!

255
00:13:34,695 --> 00:13:36,163
You are afraid.

256
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:38,031
No, I'm not, you are.

257
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,974
What are you doing?

258
00:13:43,312 --> 00:13:45,179
My name's Jog...

259
00:13:45,216 --> 00:13:47,015
I mean Jake.

260
00:13:47,053 --> 00:13:48,682
I...

261
00:13:48,723 --> 00:13:50,716
He's Nog.
I'm Jake Sisko.

262
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,232
Sisko...

263
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:56,829
We're kind of

264
00:13:56,873 --> 00:13:59,970
the unofficial welcoming
committee around here.

265
00:14:00,012 --> 00:14:01,503
That's right.

266
00:14:03,018 --> 00:14:04,988
Welcome to DS9.

267
00:14:05,022 --> 00:14:07,492
Thank you.
I'm Varis Sul.

268
00:14:07,528 --> 00:14:09,623
Would you like a tour
of the station?

269
00:14:09,665 --> 00:14:11,862
There's a Klingon freighter
leaving for the Gamma Quadrant

270
00:14:11,903 --> 00:14:12,871
in a little while.

271
00:14:12,905 --> 00:14:14,807
We could watch it
go through the wormhole.

272
00:14:14,842 --> 00:14:16,471
Good-good-good idea.

273
00:14:16,512 --> 00:14:18,106
Thanks.

274
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,446
So, how about it?

275
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:21,114
You want to go?

276
00:14:21,154 --> 00:14:23,682
I've never seen the wormhole.

277
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:25,195
Then you're in luck

278
00:14:25,229 --> 00:14:27,757
'cause we know
the best spot on the station

279
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:29,361
for wormhole-watching.

280
00:14:29,405 --> 00:14:31,773
Unless you're busy or something.

281
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:33,472
Not at the moment.

282
00:14:42,998 --> 00:14:45,161
Listen to me, Sirah.

283
00:14:45,202 --> 00:14:47,695
You must return to bed.

284
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:51,579
To be out here,
in your condition...

285
00:14:51,616 --> 00:14:53,882
Your concern touches me, Doctor

286
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,828
but I am now in the hands
of the Prophets.

287
00:14:58,863 --> 00:15:00,161
We believe in you.

288
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,292
Help us, Sirah.

289
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,257
Strange...

290
00:15:32,296 --> 00:15:36,293
I'm not registering
any atmospheric disturbance.

291
00:15:36,338 --> 00:15:40,176
The Dal'Rok wakes...

292
00:15:43,853 --> 00:15:47,850
but we are ready.

293
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:55,541
In the shadow of the night,
he hungers.

294
00:15:55,577 --> 00:15:59,642
With a hatred of the ancients,
he rages.

295
00:15:59,718 --> 00:16:04,319
From the twisted pit of chaos,
he approaches.

296
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:13,440
Is it alive?

297
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:16,713
The tricorder's still
not picking up anything.

298
00:16:16,752 --> 00:16:21,626
Could it be some kind
of holographic image?

299
00:16:21,662 --> 00:16:23,291
No.

300
00:16:23,332 --> 00:16:26,327
I'm not picking up
any power source.

301
00:16:26,371 --> 00:16:28,466
The Dal'Rok's anger

302
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:32,973
is like a wave crashing down
upon the village.

303
00:16:33,018 --> 00:16:38,826
The weight of its fury
threatens to crush us all.

304
00:16:38,863 --> 00:16:43,737
The Dal'Rok thinks the village
is powerless to defend itself...

305
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:53,653
but the Dal'Rok is mistaken.

306
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:56,494
The village is strong...

307
00:16:56,532 --> 00:17:01,251
much stronger than the Dal'Rok
can ever imagine.

308
00:17:02,687 --> 00:17:04,053
The village is strong!

309
00:17:05,793 --> 00:17:08,161
The village is strong!

310
00:17:15,144 --> 00:17:17,945
With our strength, our unity

311
00:17:17,983 --> 00:17:21,251
we shall drive the Dal'Rok...

312
00:17:34,349 --> 00:17:36,842
Bloody hell!

313
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,139
Chief!

314
00:17:47,175 --> 00:17:49,577
Help us get him down from here!

315
00:17:52,318 --> 00:17:54,083
Where is my successor?

316
00:17:54,122 --> 00:17:55,887
Sirah...

317
00:17:55,926 --> 00:17:58,396
No. The one
whom the Prophets sent.

318
00:17:58,431 --> 00:18:01,267
Yes, you.

319
00:18:01,303 --> 00:18:03,364
W-wait a second.

320
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:05,707
I think you got the wrong guy.

321
00:18:05,746 --> 00:18:07,875
Say what I say.

322
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:11,412
The village shall
not be destroyed.

323
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:12,425
What?!

324
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:14,088
Quickly.

325
00:18:14,129 --> 00:18:17,067
The village
shall not be destroyed.

326
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:21,007
Louder, so they can all hear.

327
00:18:21,043 --> 00:18:22,979
The village

328
00:18:23,013 --> 00:18:26,349
shall not be destroyed!

329
00:18:26,386 --> 00:18:28,219
Despite our fears

330
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:30,888
we shall stand our ground

331
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:33,263
and face the Dal'Rok.

332
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,700
Despite our fears

333
00:18:34,737 --> 00:18:38,336
we shall stand our ground

334
00:18:38,377 --> 00:18:40,940
and face the Dal'Rok.

335
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:47,952
The village is strong.

336
00:18:50,736 --> 00:18:54,437
More powerful than the Dal'Rok.

337
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,122
Together, we use that power

338
00:19:02,158 --> 00:19:04,628
to drive it away.

339
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:11,634
Drive it away!
Drive it away!

340
00:19:22,532 --> 00:19:24,399
The Dal'Rok is defeated.

341
00:19:27,175 --> 00:19:31,138
The village is safe.

342
00:19:41,771 --> 00:19:43,205
He's dead.

343
00:19:50,154 --> 00:19:53,058
The Sirah has left us

344
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:57,557
but the Prophets have sent us
his successor.

345
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,708
A new Sirah to tell the story.

346
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,752
Story, the story!

347
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,122
A new Sirah
to protect the village.

348
00:20:21,784 --> 00:20:25,245
So I sold them a whole herd
of Klingon <i>targs.</i>

349
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,761
Major, what a pleasant surprise.

350
00:20:27,796 --> 00:20:29,230
I always look forward

351
00:20:29,265 --> 00:20:31,497
to one
of your infrequent visits.

352
00:20:31,536 --> 00:20:34,997
Spare me the small talk
and get me a stardrifter.

353
00:20:35,044 --> 00:20:36,775
So, uh...

354
00:20:36,814 --> 00:20:41,312
how are the negotiations
coming along?

355
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:43,223
Better make it a double.

356
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,854
Ah.

357
00:20:49,739 --> 00:20:51,504
You asked to see me?

358
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,536
Please, sit down.

359
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,281
I just spent
the last five hours sitting.

360
00:20:57,321 --> 00:21:00,623
Yes, five long,
unproductive hours.

361
00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:02,460
Woban is an obstinate fool.

362
00:21:02,498 --> 00:21:03,932
Woban is here to talk.

363
00:21:03,968 --> 00:21:05,402
What are you here for?

364
00:21:05,437 --> 00:21:07,464
I would think that was obvious...

365
00:21:07,508 --> 00:21:10,036
to protect the interests
of my people.

366
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,173
How, by starting a war?

367
00:21:11,216 --> 00:21:13,083
I object to your tone,
Commander.

368
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,680
Because if that's
what you're here for...

369
00:21:14,722 --> 00:21:16,692
if you'd rather
fight than talk...

370
00:21:16,726 --> 00:21:18,217
then we're just
wasting our time.

371
00:21:18,263 --> 00:21:20,096
That land belongs to the Paqu.

372
00:21:20,134 --> 00:21:21,534
The Navot don't agree.

373
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,269
Then they'd better be ready
to die for it.

374
00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:26,575
I am.

375
00:21:26,613 --> 00:21:28,139
Or don't you believe me?

376
00:21:28,183 --> 00:21:30,050
I believe in people
working together

377
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:32,615
to find reasonable solutions
to their problems.

378
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:34,149
I hope you do as well.

379
00:21:34,195 --> 00:21:37,167
What you hope
is no concern of mine.

380
00:21:37,201 --> 00:21:39,832
Now, anything else
you wish to say to me

381
00:21:39,874 --> 00:21:43,142
can be said tomorrow
across a conference table.

382
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,478
Varis...

383
00:21:44,515 --> 00:21:47,681
are you sure your people
are as ready as you are

384
00:21:47,722 --> 00:21:49,190
to die for that land?

385
00:22:00,314 --> 00:22:02,341
Where do you think she is?

386
00:22:02,385 --> 00:22:04,855
I guess if she's not here,
we'll try again at her quarters.

387
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,985
When we find her,
let me do the talking.

388
00:22:07,028 --> 00:22:08,691
She asked me questions,
I answered them.

389
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:09,720
What's wrong with that?

390
00:22:09,766 --> 00:22:12,236
Just remember, I saw her first.

391
00:22:12,271 --> 00:22:13,432
She's mine.

392
00:22:13,473 --> 00:22:15,739
Then how come you can barely
say two words to her

393
00:22:15,845 --> 00:22:17,211
without getting tongue-tied?

394
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:18,238
That's a lie!

395
00:22:18,283 --> 00:22:20,219
I've never seen you so nervous.

396
00:22:20,254 --> 00:22:21,917
You must really like her.

397
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:23,860
I never said that!

398
00:22:23,895 --> 00:22:25,762
All I said was...

399
00:22:28,103 --> 00:22:29,868
We were just...

400
00:22:29,907 --> 00:22:31,536
Looking for you.

401
00:22:31,576 --> 00:22:33,739
I've been busy.

402
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,477
Is something wrong?

403
00:22:35,517 --> 00:22:38,387
You seem a little depressed.

404
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:41,520
It's nothing, really.

405
00:22:41,563 --> 00:22:43,897
It's just...

406
00:22:43,935 --> 00:22:47,500
there are these people
who want something I have

407
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,977
and I refuse to give it to them.

408
00:22:50,014 --> 00:22:52,041
How badly do they want it?

409
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:55,022
Very badly.

410
00:22:55,057 --> 00:22:57,824
Is there anything they have
that you want?

411
00:22:57,929 --> 00:22:59,762
That I want.

412
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:02,327
Maybe this isn't a problem.

413
00:23:02,371 --> 00:23:03,430
Maybe...

414
00:23:03,473 --> 00:23:05,943
it's an opportunity.

415
00:23:05,979 --> 00:23:08,449
Maybe.

416
00:23:08,483 --> 00:23:11,284
When I have a problem
I can't figure out

417
00:23:11,322 --> 00:23:12,620
I ask my dad.

418
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:14,423
I ask my dad, too.

419
00:23:14,462 --> 00:23:17,195
It helps, doesn't it?

420
00:23:17,234 --> 00:23:18,429
Yeah.

421
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,733
No.

422
00:23:19,772 --> 00:23:20,797
My dad's

423
00:23:20,874 --> 00:23:22,901
a pretty smart guy.

424
00:23:22,946 --> 00:23:25,509
Mine, too...

425
00:23:25,551 --> 00:23:27,817
in his own way.

426
00:23:27,923 --> 00:23:31,418
My parents are dead.

427
00:23:31,463 --> 00:23:34,765
They were killed
by the Cardassians.

428
00:23:34,802 --> 00:23:37,272
I'm sorry.

429
00:23:37,308 --> 00:23:41,612
My mom was killed
during an attack by the Borg.

430
00:23:41,649 --> 00:23:44,017
Isn't there someone
you can talk to?

431
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:45,284
Someone you trust?

432
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:47,123
I don't trust many people.

433
00:23:47,161 --> 00:23:48,322
My dad says...

434
00:23:48,363 --> 00:23:49,854
Could we please talk
about something

435
00:23:49,933 --> 00:23:50,923
besides your father?

436
00:23:52,471 --> 00:23:55,807
You admire him very much,
don't you?

437
00:23:55,844 --> 00:23:57,142
I trust him.

438
00:23:57,181 --> 00:23:58,479
Mr. Sisko...

439
00:23:58,517 --> 00:24:00,646
Odo.

440
00:24:00,687 --> 00:24:02,452
We were just leaving.

441
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:12,228
I wonder what was controlling
those energy creatures.

442
00:24:12,266 --> 00:24:14,236
One thing's certain...
it wasn't me.

443
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,899
Try telling the villagers that.

444
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,308
They saw the Sirah choose you
as his successor.

445
00:24:18,345 --> 00:24:19,540
Well, he made a mistake.

446
00:24:19,581 --> 00:24:21,551
You saw the way he greeted you
when we arrived.

447
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,919
It was as if he
was expecting you.

448
00:24:23,956 --> 00:24:25,219
But I'll tell you this, Chief

449
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:26,990
I'm glad you came along
on this mission

450
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:28,327
because if it wasn't for you

451
00:24:28,365 --> 00:24:30,267
I'd have done what I could
for the Sirah and left

452
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,600
and look what I
would have missed.

453
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:34,108
Well, I'm glad you're
enjoying yourself, Julian.

454
00:24:34,144 --> 00:24:36,614
Don't worry, Chief,
I have faith in you.

455
00:24:36,648 --> 00:24:37,707
Oh, do you?!

456
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,118
I mean, for all we know

457
00:24:40,156 --> 00:24:42,058
you really were sent
by the Prophets.

458
00:24:42,093 --> 00:24:44,461
I was sent by Commander Sisko.

459
00:24:44,564 --> 00:24:47,365
This Dal'Rok, or whatever

460
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:48,769
will be returning this evening

461
00:24:48,806 --> 00:24:51,403
and everybody's counting
on me to be able to stop it.

462
00:24:51,445 --> 00:24:53,039
The only trouble is

463
00:24:53,081 --> 00:24:56,520
I don't have the slightest idea
how I'm supposed to do that.

464
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:01,058
These gifts are for you, Sirah.

465
00:25:01,097 --> 00:25:02,794
Well, look,
tell them I don't want them.

466
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:03,927
Oh, bring them in.

467
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,666
Put them wherever you like.

468
00:25:09,881 --> 00:25:11,110
Now, look, Julian...

469
00:25:11,151 --> 00:25:12,916
We're visitors here, Chief.

470
00:25:12,954 --> 00:25:15,447
It would be impolite
to refuse our hosts.

471
00:25:15,526 --> 00:25:17,393
Thank you, Sirah.

472
00:25:20,903 --> 00:25:23,841
How can I help you, ladies?

473
00:25:23,876 --> 00:25:28,409
I think they're the ones
offering services, Chief.

474
00:25:28,452 --> 00:25:32,187
Now, look, t-there's been
a serious misunderstanding.

475
00:25:32,226 --> 00:25:34,059
Is there a problem, Sirah?

476
00:25:34,097 --> 00:25:35,463
No! They're not...

477
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:37,833
Well, yes...

478
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,965
I mean, they're quite...

479
00:25:40,008 --> 00:25:43,971
Look, I have a wife
and daughter back on DS9.

480
00:25:44,016 --> 00:25:45,781
Of course.

481
00:25:47,857 --> 00:25:49,520
You must send for them.

482
00:25:49,561 --> 00:25:50,859
Why?

483
00:25:50,896 --> 00:25:53,128
So they can live here with you.

484
00:25:53,168 --> 00:25:55,638
No, you're missing the point.

485
00:25:55,673 --> 00:25:57,107
I'm not staying.

486
00:25:57,143 --> 00:25:59,375
Then, who will tell the story?

487
00:25:59,414 --> 00:26:03,218
Well, you'll just
have to find someone else.

488
00:26:03,255 --> 00:26:04,587
But there is no one else.

489
00:26:04,624 --> 00:26:05,922
The Sirah chose you.

490
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,223
He made a mistake.

491
00:26:07,263 --> 00:26:08,857
But what about the Dal'Rok?

492
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:10,493
Without your protection,
it will kill us all.

493
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,735
Faren, I would like
to help, really I would

494
00:26:13,775 --> 00:26:15,506
but I don't know how.

495
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:17,606
You must tell the story.

496
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,745
Simple as that, is it?

497
00:26:21,391 --> 00:26:25,024
May the Prophets
grant you victory, Sirah.

498
00:26:25,064 --> 00:26:26,555
Let's hope so.

499
00:26:41,865 --> 00:26:44,028
Now what are we going to do?

500
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:47,873
The way I see it,
the only way out of this mess

501
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:51,782
is to find out exactly
what this Dal'Rok is

502
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:55,257
and destroy it
before it destroys us.

503
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,828
Station Log, supplemental.

504
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:03,704
We have completed
a second day of talks

505
00:27:03,742 --> 00:27:05,712
between the Paqu and the Navot.

506
00:27:05,746 --> 00:27:08,148
So far, we're no closer
to finding a solution

507
00:27:08,185 --> 00:27:11,123
than we were
when negotiations began.

508
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,930
Enter.

509
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,438
Hi. You want to do something?

510
00:27:19,474 --> 00:27:22,446
Sorry, not right now.

511
00:27:23,648 --> 00:27:26,950
Okay, we'll stop by later.

512
00:27:26,988 --> 00:27:31,156
Is there anything we can do
to cheer you up?

513
00:27:31,197 --> 00:27:33,760
I don't think so.

514
00:27:33,802 --> 00:27:35,795
You sure?

515
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:37,809
Let's go before
you embarrass yourself.

516
00:27:37,843 --> 00:27:38,868
Wait.

517
00:27:38,912 --> 00:27:40,244
Yes?

518
00:27:42,653 --> 00:27:45,250
Do you remember
that opportunity

519
00:27:45,292 --> 00:27:47,626
we were discussing yesterday?

520
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,427
Yes.

521
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:50,958
How can you be sure

522
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,975
that an opportunity
is worth the risk?

523
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:56,479
Ah. Instinct.

524
00:27:56,514 --> 00:27:59,315
The Ninth Rule of Acquisition
clearly states

525
00:27:59,353 --> 00:28:03,726
that opportunity plus instinct
equals profit.

526
00:28:03,762 --> 00:28:06,062
Instinct...

527
00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:08,331
That's not going to help.

528
00:28:08,371 --> 00:28:10,273
I think it does.

529
00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:12,279
Thank you, Nog.

530
00:28:12,313 --> 00:28:13,508
Good!

531
00:28:13,548 --> 00:28:16,247
Let's celebrate.

532
00:28:16,287 --> 00:28:17,482
Celebrate?

533
00:28:17,523 --> 00:28:19,459
I took one
of my uncle's security rods.

534
00:28:19,493 --> 00:28:22,021
What are we going
to do with that?

535
00:28:22,065 --> 00:28:23,294
I don't know.

536
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:25,498
We could swipe Odo's bucket.

537
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:26,802
Are you kidding?

538
00:28:26,841 --> 00:28:27,866
A bucket?

539
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:28,969
Yeah.
We'll give it back.

540
00:28:29,012 --> 00:28:29,980
Yeah, but...

541
00:28:30,014 --> 00:28:30,982
It'll be funny.

542
00:28:31,016 --> 00:28:33,043
But we can't just walk
into Security.

543
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:34,681
Watch me.

544
00:28:48,418 --> 00:28:51,822
Wait over there.

545
00:28:51,858 --> 00:28:55,559
I still don't understand
what's so funny about a bucket.

546
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:57,067
Odo lives in it.

547
00:28:57,101 --> 00:28:58,296
He's a shape-shifter.

548
00:28:58,338 --> 00:28:59,363
Every 16 hours

549
00:28:59,407 --> 00:29:01,604
he has to change back
to his original form.

550
00:29:01,644 --> 00:29:03,044
Inside a bucket?

551
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,677
He turns
into some kind of liquid.

552
00:29:10,362 --> 00:29:12,423
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

553
00:29:12,466 --> 00:29:13,764
Watch the front door.

554
00:29:13,802 --> 00:29:14,997
I'll be right back.

555
00:29:21,016 --> 00:29:23,681
Jake, are you sure
this is all right?

556
00:29:23,755 --> 00:29:27,525
Well, it's not like we're
really stealing anything.

557
00:29:27,563 --> 00:29:28,758
Found it.

558
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,497
Oops!

559
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:33,200
Odo!

560
00:29:34,944 --> 00:29:36,971
Odo!

561
00:29:38,017 --> 00:29:39,680
It's oatmeal.

562
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,715
I filled it
from the replicator.

563
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,559
Very funny!

564
00:29:48,237 --> 00:29:50,834
You should have seen your face.

565
00:30:10,114 --> 00:30:12,311
I believe that belongs to me.

566
00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:21,235
What's the rush?

567
00:30:47,623 --> 00:30:49,114
There's some residual
neutrino levels

568
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:50,685
in the microstructure
of these rocks.

569
00:30:50,729 --> 00:30:52,562
But if the Dal'Rok has
no physical substance

570
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:54,592
how can it leave
a neutrino trace?

571
00:30:54,637 --> 00:30:57,200
I didn't say it made sense,
but this rock face

572
00:30:57,241 --> 00:30:59,677
didn't just spontaneously
blow itself to pieces.

573
00:30:59,713 --> 00:31:01,580
Lucky for us,
you managed to stop it

574
00:31:01,617 --> 00:31:03,348
before it did any more damage.

575
00:31:03,388 --> 00:31:05,916
All I did was repeat
what the Sirah told me.

576
00:31:05,959 --> 00:31:07,986
In that case, how did the
Sirah manage to stop it?

577
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,523
Good question.

578
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:12,596
Maybe there's
a control mechanism

579
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:13,664
hidden somewhere.

580
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:14,676
Excuse me, miss.

581
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,383
Please, Sirah, for my daughter.

582
00:31:16,516 --> 00:31:17,643
What about her?

583
00:31:17,685 --> 00:31:21,648
It looks like she wants you
to bless her child.

584
00:31:21,693 --> 00:31:22,718
Me?!

585
00:31:22,829 --> 00:31:25,767
It would mean so much.

586
00:31:32,949 --> 00:31:35,682
I'm sure she'll make
you very proud.

587
00:31:35,721 --> 00:31:36,746
Oh, thank you.

588
00:31:36,857 --> 00:31:38,018
Thank you.

589
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:39,027
There he is.

590
00:31:39,061 --> 00:31:40,029
You're quite welcome.

591
00:31:40,063 --> 00:31:41,554
Looks like more
of your followers

592
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,898
are requesting an audience.

593
00:31:42,935 --> 00:31:44,096
Oh, no.
This won't do.

594
00:31:44,137 --> 00:31:45,902
Um, you continue
looking around here.

595
00:31:45,941 --> 00:31:47,706
I'm going to check
the Sirah's room.

596
00:31:47,745 --> 00:31:48,713
Please, please.

597
00:31:48,747 --> 00:31:52,778
I'm afraid the Sirah
is busy at the moment.

598
00:31:52,889 --> 00:31:54,882
Perhaps I could be of service.

599
00:31:54,926 --> 00:31:56,326
Sirah, come back!

600
00:31:56,362 --> 00:31:57,694
Please, Sirah, a moment.

601
00:32:26,656 --> 00:32:29,651
Look, I could use some privacy.

602
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:33,295
There are more gifts
outside for you.

603
00:32:33,336 --> 00:32:36,137
All right, bring them in.

604
00:32:36,175 --> 00:32:37,804
Hold on.

605
00:32:37,878 --> 00:32:40,314
Didn't you work for the Sirah?

606
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,716
Mm-hmm.

607
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:43,382
I, um...

608
00:32:43,422 --> 00:32:45,255
I was his apprentice.

609
00:32:45,293 --> 00:32:49,997
Oh. Did he ever reveal
any of his secrets?

610
00:32:50,036 --> 00:32:53,270
How he controlled the Dal'Rok
and that sort of thing?

611
00:32:53,309 --> 00:32:54,504
Why ask me?

612
00:32:54,545 --> 00:32:57,517
Surely, the Sirah
must have taught you

613
00:32:57,551 --> 00:32:59,145
all you need to know.

614
00:32:59,187 --> 00:33:00,246
Oh, all right!

615
00:33:00,289 --> 00:33:01,587
Have it your way.

616
00:33:01,626 --> 00:33:04,291
Don't blame me
when that creature

617
00:33:04,331 --> 00:33:07,167
goes rampaging
through your village.

618
00:33:14,017 --> 00:33:15,680
Chief!

619
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:19,691
Careful.

620
00:33:19,729 --> 00:33:21,289
Don't hurt him.

621
00:33:21,331 --> 00:33:23,028
I'll try not to.

622
00:33:25,373 --> 00:33:26,398
That's enough.

623
00:33:26,442 --> 00:33:27,535
Tell him that.

624
00:33:28,714 --> 00:33:30,707
I said, that's enough!

625
00:33:35,828 --> 00:33:38,857
Now, you mind explaining
why you tried to kill me?

626
00:33:43,744 --> 00:33:46,545
You are not the true Sirah.

627
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:50,216
You won't get
any argument from me.

628
00:33:50,256 --> 00:33:52,249
If he isn't, who is?

629
00:33:52,293 --> 00:33:54,422
I am.

630
00:34:05,486 --> 00:34:09,790
For nine years,
I studied with the Sirah

631
00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:15,467
learning the secrets
of the storyteller

632
00:34:15,506 --> 00:34:19,708
only to have you come
along and take my place.

633
00:34:19,749 --> 00:34:21,981
Look, friend,
as far as I'm concerned

634
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,181
the job's yours.

635
00:34:23,222 --> 00:34:25,089
But if you were
supposed to take over

636
00:34:25,126 --> 00:34:26,594
how come the Sirah chose him?

637
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:28,223
It was his way of punishing me.

638
00:34:28,265 --> 00:34:30,896
Punishing you?

639
00:34:30,938 --> 00:34:32,031
Three nights ago

640
00:34:32,073 --> 00:34:34,670
the Sirah allowed me
to tell the story

641
00:34:34,712 --> 00:34:39,552
but when the Dal'Rok appeared,
I was unable to control it.

642
00:34:39,589 --> 00:34:41,923
Several people were injured.

643
00:34:41,993 --> 00:34:43,359
Control it, how?

644
00:34:43,395 --> 00:34:45,194
With this.

645
00:34:45,233 --> 00:34:48,228
This stone is said to be
a fragment of an Orb

646
00:34:48,272 --> 00:34:49,935
from the Celestial Temple.

647
00:34:50,042 --> 00:34:53,071
We had one of those Orbs
aboard our station.

648
00:34:53,115 --> 00:34:55,608
We're aware
of how powerful they are.

649
00:34:55,654 --> 00:34:58,888
Many years ago, this village
was deeply divided

650
00:34:58,927 --> 00:35:00,395
by hate and mistrust.

651
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:04,028
The first Sirah knew
that unless he could find a way

652
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:07,304
to unite the people, the village
would destroy itself

653
00:35:07,343 --> 00:35:10,645
so he used the Orb fragment
as a catalyst

654
00:35:10,684 --> 00:35:13,622
to give their fears
a physical form.

655
00:35:13,657 --> 00:35:17,256
So the villagers' thoughts
create the Dal'Rok.

656
00:35:17,297 --> 00:35:20,098
Yes, but they don't know that.

657
00:35:20,136 --> 00:35:24,634
It's a secret which is passed
from Sirah to Sirah.

658
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:26,512
Why do they need a storyteller?

659
00:35:26,548 --> 00:35:29,816
The story helps to focus
the villagers' thoughts.

660
00:35:29,855 --> 00:35:32,520
And that enables them
to defeat the Dal'Rok

661
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,496
by creating
the shimmering lights.

662
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:39,663
I know, if I had another chance,
I could control the Dal'Rok.

663
00:35:41,011 --> 00:35:42,878
Well, son

664
00:35:42,915 --> 00:35:44,612
it looks like tonight

665
00:35:44,652 --> 00:35:47,283
you are going
to get that chance.

666
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:56,200
What is this?

667
00:35:56,241 --> 00:35:58,711
You have no right
to wear those clothes.

668
00:35:58,747 --> 00:35:59,942
I have every right.

669
00:35:59,982 --> 00:36:01,450
You had your chance
to prove yourself.

670
00:36:01,485 --> 00:36:02,453
You failed.

671
00:36:02,487 --> 00:36:03,955
It won't happen again.

672
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:04,958
That's right...

673
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,460
because you won't be allowed

674
00:36:06,495 --> 00:36:08,488
to endanger the village
a second time.

675
00:36:08,532 --> 00:36:09,898
Now take off those robes!

676
00:36:15,413 --> 00:36:16,779
Now, hold on.

677
00:36:16,816 --> 00:36:18,479
Sirah...

678
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:20,716
it's time you were
getting ready.

679
00:36:20,757 --> 00:36:23,193
The people will be assembling
soon to hear the story.

680
00:36:39,027 --> 00:36:40,427
I want you to know, Commander

681
00:36:40,463 --> 00:36:42,023
that I take
complete responsibility

682
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:44,501
for what happened
in the Security Office.

683
00:36:44,537 --> 00:36:46,769
I think that there's
more than enough blame

684
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:47,799
to spread around.

685
00:36:47,845 --> 00:36:49,781
Jake should have known better.

686
00:36:49,815 --> 00:36:53,949
I'm afraid he and Nog
were just trying to impress me.

687
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:56,222
That's not much of an excuse.

688
00:36:56,261 --> 00:36:58,960
Didn't you ever do
anything foolish

689
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,434
to impress a girl?

690
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:01,801
I may have.

691
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,105
Jake's a nice boy.

692
00:37:04,144 --> 00:37:07,548
So is Nog... in his own way.

693
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:10,282
I enjoy their company.

694
00:37:10,322 --> 00:37:12,519
I suppose you don't get
much of a chance

695
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,028
to be with people your age.

696
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:17,261
True, but...

697
00:37:17,303 --> 00:37:20,834
that's not why I wanted
to be with them.

698
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,946
I wanted to learn about you.

699
00:37:24,985 --> 00:37:26,818
And?

700
00:37:26,856 --> 00:37:30,056
Jake speaks very highly of you.

701
00:37:30,162 --> 00:37:31,653
He trusts you.

702
00:37:31,698 --> 00:37:33,964
That's always nice to hear.

703
00:37:35,974 --> 00:37:40,176
Hearing Jake speak of you...

704
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:44,088
reminded me of how much
I miss my own parents.

705
00:37:45,392 --> 00:37:47,555
My father was a great man.

706
00:37:47,597 --> 00:37:49,533
A great leader.

707
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,662
I'm sure he'd be
very proud of you.

708
00:37:51,705 --> 00:37:53,265
I try to be strong

709
00:37:53,308 --> 00:37:56,644
the way he was strong, but...

710
00:37:58,953 --> 00:38:00,616
it's difficult.

711
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:02,626
From what I've learned
of your father

712
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,721
he wasn't afraid to compromise.

713
00:38:03,855 --> 00:38:06,418
That's because he knew
the Navot feared him.

714
00:38:06,527 --> 00:38:10,331
If I were to make concessions,
Woban would think I was weak.

715
00:38:10,368 --> 00:38:12,361
I doubt he would be
that foolish

716
00:38:12,405 --> 00:38:15,138
but he is determined
to get that land back.

717
00:38:15,178 --> 00:38:18,617
I am not afraid
of Woban or the Navot.

718
00:38:18,651 --> 00:38:20,712
I never said you were.

719
00:38:20,755 --> 00:38:23,556
So your answer is still no.

720
00:38:23,594 --> 00:38:27,864
You don't lose by saying no.

721
00:38:27,903 --> 00:38:29,269
Maybe

722
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:32,301
but a great leader
like your father

723
00:38:32,345 --> 00:38:35,876
is one who's willing
to risk saying yes.

724
00:38:46,473 --> 00:38:48,875
Commander...

725
00:38:50,181 --> 00:38:52,174
I believe I know of...

726
00:38:52,218 --> 00:38:54,051
an opportunity...

727
00:38:54,089 --> 00:38:57,722
that could allow both sides
to say yes.

728
00:39:09,352 --> 00:39:11,584
Sirah, you'll save us.

729
00:39:11,623 --> 00:39:13,820
I thought you wanted this job.

730
00:39:13,862 --> 00:39:14,989
I do.

731
00:39:15,031 --> 00:39:17,935
Then, why don't you
fight for it?

732
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,701
No, Faren is right.

733
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:23,509
These people will never
accept me as Sirah.

734
00:39:23,614 --> 00:39:25,516
Without their support

735
00:39:25,584 --> 00:39:28,522
I could never control
the Dal'Rok.

736
00:39:28,624 --> 00:39:30,924
You think I can?

737
00:39:30,963 --> 00:39:33,433
You have to.

738
00:39:33,467 --> 00:39:35,164
Oh, Chief.

739
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:38,538
Good luck.

740
00:39:54,409 --> 00:39:55,775
Tell us the story!

741
00:39:58,017 --> 00:39:59,007
Sirah, the story!

742
00:40:03,761 --> 00:40:07,531
Once upon a time...

743
00:40:07,568 --> 00:40:10,233
there was a Dal'Rok

744
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:14,544
and it lives there, in the woods

745
00:40:14,582 --> 00:40:17,884
and he hated the village

746
00:40:17,923 --> 00:40:20,861
and all of the villagers

747
00:40:20,895 --> 00:40:25,393
and he wanted
to see them destroyed.

748
00:40:25,438 --> 00:40:28,001
The Dal'Rok is here!

749
00:40:28,043 --> 00:40:32,416
Yes! The Dal'Rok is here

750
00:40:32,452 --> 00:40:34,922
and it's hungry

751
00:40:34,957 --> 00:40:38,590
but the village
is prepared to fight

752
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:41,329
like it has always fought...

753
00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:44,341
with the lights,
the shimmering lights.

754
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:47,575
Something's wrong.

755
00:40:47,615 --> 00:40:51,680
What's wrong is that O'Brien
is not the Sirah...

756
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:52,815
you are.

757
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:53,884
Come on, you can do it!

758
00:40:53,927 --> 00:40:57,229
The village is strong

759
00:40:57,268 --> 00:41:01,072
and unafraid...
and... powerful

760
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:04,640
and ready to face the Dal'Rok.

761
00:41:04,682 --> 00:41:07,984
Do you think that maybe
the Sirah planned all this?

762
00:41:08,023 --> 00:41:11,154
He knew the villagers
had lost confidence in you

763
00:41:11,196 --> 00:41:13,325
so he chose O'Brien
as his successor

764
00:41:13,367 --> 00:41:15,166
knowing that you would
have to rescue him.

765
00:41:15,204 --> 00:41:16,229
Don't you see...

766
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:19,575
this is your chance
to prove once and for all

767
00:41:19,612 --> 00:41:20,875
that you are the true Sirah.

768
00:41:20,915 --> 00:41:22,008
All right now...

769
00:41:22,051 --> 00:41:25,923
let's really focus
and send this one out, okay?

770
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:29,397
Let's really send
the Dal'Rok a message.

771
00:41:29,432 --> 00:41:32,871
Where the hell are those lights?

772
00:41:48,637 --> 00:41:50,071
Wait!

773
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:52,339
There is no need to run!

774
00:41:52,378 --> 00:41:54,245
A new voice appears

775
00:41:54,282 --> 00:41:56,752
to challenge the Dal'Rok!

776
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,981
It's about time.

777
00:41:58,023 --> 00:42:00,859
The Dal'Rok is a fearsome enemy.

778
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:03,364
The mountains tremble
with its fury

779
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:07,807
but our prosperity
is its misery

780
00:42:07,842 --> 00:42:11,281
our unity is its vulnerability

781
00:42:11,316 --> 00:42:14,811
and our strength is its doom.

782
00:42:14,856 --> 00:42:19,297
Look... the Dal'Rok trembles!

783
00:42:19,332 --> 00:42:22,863
It fears our strength.

784
00:42:22,905 --> 00:42:26,309
It fears our determination.

785
00:42:26,346 --> 00:42:31,379
It knows
it cannot stand against us

786
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:34,190
because the village is united.

787
00:42:34,228 --> 00:42:35,857
We are as one.

788
00:42:47,555 --> 00:42:50,789
You see for yourselves.

789
00:42:50,894 --> 00:42:53,923
The Dal'Rok is defeated.

790
00:42:53,967 --> 00:42:56,996
This village is safe
for another year.

791
00:42:58,977 --> 00:43:01,209
The Sirah! The Sirah!

792
00:43:01,249 --> 00:43:05,747
Let's get out of here
before they change their minds.

793
00:43:05,824 --> 00:43:07,851
Sirah! Sirah!
Sirah!

794
00:43:12,671 --> 00:43:14,868
Hail the Sirah.

795
00:43:18,917 --> 00:43:21,514
Nervous?

796
00:43:21,556 --> 00:43:23,890
Not at all.

797
00:43:23,927 --> 00:43:25,395
Maybe a little.

798
00:43:25,431 --> 00:43:27,994
Do you think Woban
will accept my proposal?

799
00:43:28,035 --> 00:43:29,230
It's very possible.

800
00:43:29,272 --> 00:43:31,742
It would give the Navot
back their land.

801
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,748
And free trade access
to both sides of the river

802
00:43:34,782 --> 00:43:36,615
would mean a lot to my people.

803
00:43:36,653 --> 00:43:38,452
It's a reasonable compromise.

804
00:43:41,129 --> 00:43:44,226
We thought we'd wish you luck
with your meeting.

805
00:43:44,268 --> 00:43:45,794
Thank you...

806
00:43:52,952 --> 00:43:54,751
...for all your help.

807
00:43:58,897 --> 00:44:00,526
All right, let's go.

808
00:44:00,567 --> 00:44:03,801
You two are going
to clean the Security Office

809
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:05,536
until it shines.

810
00:44:07,046 --> 00:44:08,309
You know, Chief

811
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:09,818
this is going to make
a fantastic story

812
00:44:09,886 --> 00:44:10,979
to tell around the station.

813
00:44:11,021 --> 00:44:12,786
Not for me.

814
00:44:12,825 --> 00:44:15,193
I've had my fill of storytelling
for the time being.

815
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:17,223
Well, I hope you don't mind
if I mention it.

816
00:44:17,268 --> 00:44:19,670
Suit yourself... Julian.

817
00:44:19,705 --> 00:44:22,073
Oh, and, Chief,
on second thought...

818
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:25,105
you don't really have
to call me Julian.

819
00:44:26,753 --> 00:44:29,223
Right you are... sir.
