1
00:00:07,072 --> 00:00:09,099
Can't you ever just let go?

2
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:10,441
Let go?

3
00:00:10,479 --> 00:00:12,472
The place is almost deserted.

4
00:00:12,517 --> 00:00:15,182
There hasn't been a ship in
for three days

5
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:16,757
and yet you sit there

6
00:00:16,792 --> 00:00:19,525
like a Baneriam hawk
looking for prey.

7
00:00:19,564 --> 00:00:21,761
This is your chance to relax.

8
00:00:21,802 --> 00:00:23,202
I could set you up

9
00:00:23,238 --> 00:00:25,208
with a terrific
holosuite program.

10
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,336
Thank you,
but I don't accept gifts

11
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:28,711
from the likes of you.

12
00:00:28,749 --> 00:00:30,719
Who said anything about gifts?

13
00:00:30,753 --> 00:00:32,689
You pay like everyone else.

14
00:00:32,724 --> 00:00:34,717
I'm just trying to get
you into the tent.

15
00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:36,458
I have no time for fantasies.

16
00:00:36,497 --> 00:00:37,988
No imagination, huh?

17
00:00:38,034 --> 00:00:39,229
A waste of time.

18
00:00:39,337 --> 00:00:41,637
Too many people dream
of places they'll never go

19
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:43,907
wish for things
they'll never have

20
00:00:43,946 --> 00:00:45,813
instead of paying
adequate attention

21
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,250
to their real lives.

22
00:00:47,353 --> 00:00:49,414
I could create

23
00:00:49,457 --> 00:00:52,224
a shape-shifter playmate
for you.

24
00:00:52,262 --> 00:00:56,362
The two of you could,
uh... intermingle.

25
00:00:56,404 --> 00:00:57,930
You're disgusting.

26
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,878
It's a living.

27
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:07,187
You're not allowing
young Mr. Sisko

28
00:01:07,226 --> 00:01:09,059
in your holosuites, I hope.

29
00:01:09,096 --> 00:01:10,564
It's not what you think.

30
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,898
It better not be.

31
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:13,905
You see that thing on his hand?

32
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:16,136
It's a baseball mitten.

33
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:19,115
Every afternoon,
the boy goes up to play.

34
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,179
His father brought a program
with famous players.

35
00:01:22,222 --> 00:01:24,249
You ever hear of Tris Speaker

36
00:01:24,326 --> 00:01:27,765
or Ted Williams or Buck Bokai?

37
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:29,099
Afraid not.

38
00:01:29,136 --> 00:01:30,434
Neither did I

39
00:01:30,472 --> 00:01:33,205
until I made it my business
to find out.

40
00:01:33,244 --> 00:01:35,875
With all these humans coming now

41
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:37,944
the true entrepreneur

42
00:01:37,987 --> 00:01:41,620
knows how to...
sniff the wind.

43
00:01:41,662 --> 00:01:43,062
Try it.

44
00:01:43,097 --> 00:01:44,224
Go ahead.

45
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:46,634
I have no sense of smell.

46
00:01:46,672 --> 00:01:49,769
You don't need one
to detect the scent

47
00:01:49,811 --> 00:01:52,304
of op-por-tunity.

48
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:54,649
Opportunity.

49
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,626
Family entertainment.

50
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,323
That's the future, Odo.

51
00:01:59,363 --> 00:02:01,299
There's a fortune to be made.

52
00:02:01,334 --> 00:02:03,770
Little holocreatures
running around.

53
00:02:03,806 --> 00:02:06,038
Rides and games for the kiddies.

54
00:02:06,077 --> 00:02:08,274
Ferengis standing
in every doorway

55
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:10,818
selling... useless souvenirs.

56
00:02:10,853 --> 00:02:14,816
You're going to replace
all your sexual holoprograms

57
00:02:14,861 --> 00:02:16,592
with family entertainment?

58
00:02:16,631 --> 00:02:17,621
No, no.

59
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:19,296
No. I'm expanding.

60
00:02:19,336 --> 00:02:22,069
I'm negotiating
to lease the space next door

61
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:24,409
so I can use
the same hologenerators.

62
00:02:24,446 --> 00:02:26,313
Well, you're still disgusting.

63
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,786
Till the day I die.

64
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:32,495
I'm sure you're exaggerating.

65
00:02:32,529 --> 00:02:34,829
You are constantly
in my thoughts.

66
00:02:34,868 --> 00:02:36,166
I can't even...

67
00:02:36,203 --> 00:02:39,664
That was two <i>raktajinos,</i>
extra strong.

68
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:42,274
I can't even concentrate.

69
00:02:42,316 --> 00:02:45,686
You seemed to be
concentrating just fine

70
00:02:45,723 --> 00:02:49,288
on the Junior Lieutenant
at the reception

71
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,993
for Captain Stadius.

72
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:54,564
She was a poor substitute
for you.

73
00:02:54,607 --> 00:03:00,245
And the Betazoid envoy
who was here last week.

74
00:03:00,285 --> 00:03:03,746
A... barely...

75
00:03:03,792 --> 00:03:06,764
adequate substitute for you.

76
00:03:06,798 --> 00:03:11,171
Julian, you are
a wonderful friend.

77
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:16,108
I enjoy the time
we spend together.

78
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,641
Stop.

79
00:03:17,686 --> 00:03:20,920
You're driving a stake
through my heart.

80
00:03:23,431 --> 00:03:27,872
Try a high-pitched sonic shower.

81
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,740
It will make you feel better.

82
00:03:29,778 --> 00:03:32,375
No, it won't.

83
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,750
I've already tried it.

84
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,738
Sorry I'm late.

85
00:03:45,776 --> 00:03:47,905
I was having dinner with Julian.

86
00:03:47,947 --> 00:03:49,814
How is our young doctor?

87
00:03:49,851 --> 00:03:51,514
Young.

88
00:03:51,554 --> 00:03:53,045
Anything going on?

89
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:55,892
We were just looking
at an unusual energy reading.

90
00:03:57,466 --> 00:04:00,336
Elevated thoron emissions
in the plasma field.

91
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:02,637
We thought it might be
an environmental byproduct

92
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,873
created by the increased
traffic in this area.

93
00:04:04,914 --> 00:04:06,212
It could be.

94
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,881
Ships have always avoided
the Denorios Belt.

95
00:04:08,922 --> 00:04:10,949
And we have no idea
how the presence

96
00:04:10,993 --> 00:04:13,156
of so many warp
and impulse engines

97
00:04:13,197 --> 00:04:14,222
might affect it.

98
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:15,393
The question is...

99
00:04:15,435 --> 00:04:17,905
is this going
to cause us any problems?

100
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,242
We were hoping
you could tell us.

101
00:04:24,753 --> 00:04:26,244
"...and the messenger
from the queen

102
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,751
"watched the little man as he
danced and sang and laughed.

103
00:04:29,798 --> 00:04:33,168
"How he would soon have
the daughter he always wanted

104
00:04:33,204 --> 00:04:36,574
because they would never guess
that his name was?"

105
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,375
Rumpelstiltskin.

106
00:04:38,414 --> 00:04:40,043
"Rumpelstiltskin."

107
00:04:40,084 --> 00:04:41,575
Right.

108
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,111
"And the next day

109
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,024
"when the little man
came and asked

110
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:49,434
"'Now, Mrs. Queen,
what is my name? '

111
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:55,243
"She said, at first, 'Well,
are you called, um... Jack? '

112
00:04:55,281 --> 00:04:57,308
"'No,' he answered.

113
00:04:57,352 --> 00:05:00,483
"'Are you called Harry? '

114
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:03,325
"'No,' he answered.

115
00:05:03,364 --> 00:05:06,768
"And then she said,
'Then perhaps

116
00:05:06,804 --> 00:05:08,204
'your name is?"'

117
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,436
Rumpelstiltskin!

118
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,910
"'Rumpelstiltskin.'

119
00:05:10,946 --> 00:05:13,782
"And, at the sound
of his own name

120
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:16,085
"the old man was so furious

121
00:05:16,123 --> 00:05:20,029
"that he stamped his foot,
shaking the entire kingdom

122
00:05:20,064 --> 00:05:23,366
"and he broke in two
and disappeared

123
00:05:23,404 --> 00:05:26,342
"and the king and the queen
and their daughter

124
00:05:26,377 --> 00:05:29,816
lived happily ever after."

125
00:05:29,851 --> 00:05:31,319
Good night, little one.

126
00:05:33,859 --> 00:05:35,157
Sweet dreams.

127
00:05:35,194 --> 00:05:36,788
I'm not tired.

128
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,093
Ah, ah, ah.

129
00:05:38,134 --> 00:05:39,466
None of that.

130
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,705
Good night, sweetheart.

131
00:05:51,895 --> 00:05:55,767
Now, then, shall I tuck you in
with a bedtime story, too?

132
00:05:55,802 --> 00:05:58,272
Mmm! Only if you're
tucked in with me.

133
00:05:58,307 --> 00:06:00,038
Mmm. Naturally.

134
00:06:03,184 --> 00:06:04,847
Mommy?

135
00:06:04,887 --> 00:06:07,357
What is it, honey?

136
00:06:07,392 --> 00:06:09,055
He's in my room.

137
00:06:09,096 --> 00:06:11,123
Who?

138
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,136
Rumpelstiltskin.

139
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:17,275
Sweetheart...

140
00:06:17,312 --> 00:06:19,875
that was just make-believe.

141
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:23,516
Rumpelstiltskin
isn't real, okay?

142
00:06:23,557 --> 00:06:25,117
All right.

143
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:28,463
I'll come in and check,
but then it's bedtime.

144
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:30,368
Why do we tell her stories

145
00:06:30,405 --> 00:06:34,072
about evil dwarfs
that want to steal children?

146
00:06:38,587 --> 00:06:40,955
Well, don't look so distraught.

147
00:06:40,993 --> 00:06:43,897
I'm only here
to offer you my services

148
00:06:43,932 --> 00:06:46,495
if you should need them.

149
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:49,879
Take her out of here.

150
00:08:49,913 --> 00:08:51,279
What's wrong?

151
00:08:53,187 --> 00:08:54,382
Miles, what?

152
00:08:54,423 --> 00:08:55,914
Please, just go.

153
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:00,324
A pity you're sending
the ladies away.

154
00:09:00,368 --> 00:09:03,967
It's as if all the life
just went out of the room.

155
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:06,640
O'Brien to Security.

156
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,648
Go ahead.

157
00:09:07,682 --> 00:09:08,672
Intruder alert.

158
00:09:08,751 --> 00:09:10,219
Send a team to my quarters
immediately.

159
00:09:10,255 --> 00:09:11,245
On our way, Chief.

160
00:09:22,445 --> 00:09:24,312
So where's the straw?

161
00:09:24,349 --> 00:09:27,719
I assume you want gold
spun from straw.

162
00:09:27,822 --> 00:09:29,348
What are you?

163
00:09:29,393 --> 00:09:32,058
Well, surely you must know.

164
00:09:32,098 --> 00:09:34,695
You were just telling
the little one all about me.

165
00:09:34,736 --> 00:09:38,676
I know what you look like,
but you're not...

166
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,111
Ah! Don't say it.

167
00:09:40,148 --> 00:09:42,641
I don't like the sound of it,
you know.

168
00:09:42,686 --> 00:09:44,315
Rumpelstiltskin.

169
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,427
Now, you didn't think

170
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,993
that would make me break in two
and disappear, did you?

171
00:09:51,035 --> 00:09:52,664
Not this time.

172
00:09:52,706 --> 00:09:55,405
I learned my lesson
back in the kingdom.

173
00:09:55,445 --> 00:09:58,008
I don't make deals
like that anymore.

174
00:09:59,853 --> 00:10:01,789
Ah, the local constabularies.

175
00:10:01,857 --> 00:10:04,795
Gents, show me
a small bit of courtesy

176
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,800
and I'll be very pleasant

177
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:09,805
but try and lay a hand on me
and you'll soon regret it.

178
00:10:09,906 --> 00:10:13,242
Besides,
I'm much too fast for you.

179
00:10:15,318 --> 00:10:16,947
And now, my good host

180
00:10:16,987 --> 00:10:18,820
if gold is not your pleasure

181
00:10:18,891 --> 00:10:21,954
tell me your needs
and I'll tell you my price.

182
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,830
O'Brien to Sisko.

183
00:10:23,901 --> 00:10:25,199
Go ahead, Chief.

184
00:10:25,238 --> 00:10:27,835
I need you in my quarters
on the double.

185
00:10:27,876 --> 00:10:29,367
I'm on my way.

186
00:10:30,748 --> 00:10:32,615
Dad, I've got to talk to you.

187
00:10:32,652 --> 00:10:34,713
Now, Jake, I don't have time.
I'm...

188
00:10:37,662 --> 00:10:39,130
Hello, Ben.

189
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:42,138
He followed me home
from the holosuite.

190
00:10:57,602 --> 00:10:59,834
Mmm...

191
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,655
Jadzia!

192
00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:13,724
Hello, Julian.

193
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:15,396
What are you doing here?

194
00:11:15,438 --> 00:11:16,406
Watching you.

195
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,205
Waiting for you to wake up.

196
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:19,542
I'm awake.

197
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:20,979
Is something wrong?

198
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:24,181
Funny, I was about
to ask you the same question.

199
00:11:24,222 --> 00:11:25,987
It... it...

200
00:11:26,025 --> 00:11:29,829
must be this Larosian virus
that's been going around.

201
00:11:29,866 --> 00:11:31,392
How do you feel?

202
00:11:31,436 --> 00:11:33,030
Wonderful.

203
00:11:33,072 --> 00:11:34,131
Um...

204
00:11:34,175 --> 00:11:35,165
Mmm...

205
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:36,908
No... no fever.

206
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,347
Uh... must be me.

207
00:11:38,384 --> 00:11:40,616
Must be me.
Must be me.

208
00:11:40,655 --> 00:11:42,818
Uh... must be
an allergic reaction

209
00:11:42,859 --> 00:11:45,922
to the replicated antipasto
I had at lunch.

210
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:47,193
Perhaps...

211
00:11:47,235 --> 00:11:48,932
I must be hallucinating.

212
00:11:49,004 --> 00:11:50,940
Why are you fighting this?

213
00:11:51,008 --> 00:11:53,069
Why am I fighting this?

214
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,582
Why... am I fighting this?

215
00:11:57,956 --> 00:12:03,422
I have no good answer
to that question.

216
00:12:05,504 --> 00:12:08,601
All senior officers
report to Ops immediately.

217
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:09,669
Okay.

218
00:12:09,713 --> 00:12:11,478
I get it.

219
00:12:11,516 --> 00:12:12,745
Very funny.

220
00:12:12,785 --> 00:12:14,618
Did O'Brien put you up to this?

221
00:12:14,656 --> 00:12:17,058
I don't know
what you're talking about.

222
00:12:17,094 --> 00:12:18,723
"Senior officers to Ops."

223
00:12:18,764 --> 00:12:19,925
We all walk in

224
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:22,698
everybody has a good laugh
at my expense.

225
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:24,504
This is not a joke, Julian.

226
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:26,205
We'll see.

227
00:12:31,256 --> 00:12:32,485
Ah. Good.

228
00:12:32,525 --> 00:12:35,691
It seems we have
a small mystery on our hands.

229
00:12:35,731 --> 00:12:37,894
Lieutenant Jadzia Dax
and Dr. Julian Bashir

230
00:12:37,935 --> 00:12:39,598
I'd like you
to meet Harmon Bokai

231
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:42,406
a baseball player from the
London Kings who's been dead

232
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:43,971
for 200 years.

233
00:12:44,048 --> 00:12:45,175
Don't look at me.

234
00:12:45,216 --> 00:12:46,981
I can't figure it out either.

235
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,217
And a medieval
fairy tale character

236
00:12:49,258 --> 00:12:50,658
named Rumpelstiltskin.

237
00:12:50,695 --> 00:12:51,663
Oh, fine.

238
00:12:51,697 --> 00:12:53,667
Now everyone knows my name.

239
00:12:53,701 --> 00:12:56,901
Until today, he only
existed in storybooks.

240
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,842
A pleasure, I'm... I'm sure.

241
00:12:58,877 --> 00:13:00,311
Could this be related

242
00:13:00,348 --> 00:13:02,477
to the increased
thoron emissions

243
00:13:02,518 --> 00:13:03,884
in the plasma field?

244
00:13:05,658 --> 00:13:07,525
Thoron emissions?

245
00:13:07,562 --> 00:13:10,864
I think you'd better ask me,
Benjamin.

246
00:13:29,138 --> 00:13:30,971
I was hitting a few to the boy.

247
00:13:31,008 --> 00:13:34,310
He's really been moving well
under the ball lately, Ben.

248
00:13:34,349 --> 00:13:36,717
We would have worked
on some baserunning

249
00:13:36,753 --> 00:13:39,155
except, uh... well,
he was getting hungry

250
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:40,659
and I realized I was, too.

251
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,323
A hologram with an appetite?

252
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:44,426
Hologram?

253
00:13:44,469 --> 00:13:46,029
On the contrary, Major.

254
00:13:46,138 --> 00:13:47,436
He's quite real.

255
00:13:47,475 --> 00:13:49,604
They all seem to be.

256
00:13:49,646 --> 00:13:51,240
What the hell
they talking about, Ben?

257
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:59,663
You.
You're not actually Buck Bokai.

258
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:02,262
So how come
I'm wearing his uniform?

259
00:14:02,304 --> 00:14:05,003
You're a holographic image
of Buck Bokai that I created

260
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:06,945
so Jake and I could
play ball with you.

261
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,973
But I remember.

262
00:14:09,017 --> 00:14:10,987
I remember all the games.

263
00:14:11,021 --> 00:14:12,718
All the opening days.

264
00:14:12,758 --> 00:14:15,889
The homer
that won the '42 World Series.

265
00:14:15,931 --> 00:14:18,801
The squeaker that went
under Eddie Newson's glove.

266
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:21,809
The day I broke
DiMaggio's consecutive streak.

267
00:14:21,843 --> 00:14:24,313
I programmed it
into the computer...

268
00:14:24,348 --> 00:14:27,013
all of it... every statistic.

269
00:14:27,053 --> 00:14:29,923
What foreign tongue
are they speaking?

270
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:33,329
This one didn't come out
of any holosuite.

271
00:14:33,366 --> 00:14:35,529
But he did come out
of your imagination

272
00:14:35,571 --> 00:14:37,473
just as Buck came out of Jake's.

273
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:39,637
His imagination?

274
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,280
Then, I must have come out
of your imagination, Julian.

275
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:46,952
Uh... not necessarily.

276
00:14:46,993 --> 00:14:48,724
Well...

277
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:49,959
maybe.

278
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:53,403
How could this sort of thing
possibly happen?

279
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,410
A subspace disruption.

280
00:14:55,444 --> 00:14:58,416
Maybe some kind
of dimensional shift.

281
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,251
I didn't see an anomaly
when I scanned the plasma field

282
00:15:01,288 --> 00:15:04,158
but it could have been so small
the sensors missed it.

283
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,664
Julian, let's go
to your quarters.

284
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,034
Please.
I haven't got time for this.

285
00:15:11,308 --> 00:15:13,278
Odo to Sisko.

286
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,439
Go ahead.

287
00:15:14,482 --> 00:15:16,611
Is there something
you want to tell me?

288
00:15:16,653 --> 00:15:18,213
I'm in no mood for games,
Constable.

289
00:15:18,255 --> 00:15:19,553
What do you need?

290
00:15:19,592 --> 00:15:22,085
Are the environmental controls
broken down?

291
00:15:22,163 --> 00:15:23,928
It's snowing on the Promenade.

292
00:15:23,967 --> 00:15:25,094
Snowing?

293
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:27,366
We're looking at five
or six centimeters down here.

294
00:15:27,407 --> 00:15:29,240
Bring in
all available security, Odo.

295
00:15:29,277 --> 00:15:31,076
We're going to Yellow Alert.

296
00:15:31,115 --> 00:15:32,413
What's going on?

297
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:34,921
It seems we're letting
our imaginations run wild.

298
00:15:34,956 --> 00:15:37,792
As soon as I have an
explanation, I'll give you one.

299
00:15:37,828 --> 00:15:39,126
Sisko out.

300
00:15:39,164 --> 00:15:40,462
Yellow Alert?

301
00:15:40,501 --> 00:15:42,061
Against our own imaginations?

302
00:15:42,103 --> 00:15:44,073
You have a better idea?

303
00:15:44,107 --> 00:15:47,842
I think I've got something.

304
00:15:47,882 --> 00:15:50,854
Look at the wave patterns
of the plasma field.

305
00:15:50,888 --> 00:15:53,154
The wave fronts are converging
toward a single point.

306
00:15:53,225 --> 00:15:56,629
The particle density rises
as you get closer to the center

307
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,829
but then it looks like it
just drops off completely.

308
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,168
You're right.

309
00:16:00,273 --> 00:16:02,431
I'm not getting any particulate
readings from the core.

310
00:16:02,565 --> 00:16:03,897
What does that mean?

311
00:16:03,934 --> 00:16:07,533
Whatever falls in there
is just gone.

312
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:08,804
You were right.

313
00:16:08,911 --> 00:16:11,474
It is some kind
of subspace disruption.

314
00:16:11,517 --> 00:16:13,316
I want a full analysis.

315
00:16:13,353 --> 00:16:15,516
Chief,
get a class-4 probe ready.

316
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:16,821
Aye, sir.

317
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:19,387
Is there anything
I can do to help?

318
00:16:22,304 --> 00:16:23,830
Odo to Ops.

319
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,638
Go ahead.

320
00:16:25,678 --> 00:16:27,146
The snow's disappeared

321
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:31,416
but now there's a Gunji jackdaw
running loose around here.

322
00:16:31,455 --> 00:16:34,086
Just try to keep things
under control, Odo.

323
00:16:34,128 --> 00:16:35,562
We're working on it.

324
00:16:35,598 --> 00:16:37,261
Understood.

325
00:16:39,606 --> 00:16:41,735
Come along now.
Come along.

326
00:16:41,777 --> 00:16:43,268
There we go.

327
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:00,609
Ladies and gentlemen

328
00:17:00,648 --> 00:17:03,484
may I have your attention,
please?

329
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,551
Ladies and gentlemen

330
00:17:07,595 --> 00:17:10,226
and all androgynous creatures

331
00:17:10,266 --> 00:17:11,734
your attention, please.

332
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,569
As you may have noticed

333
00:17:13,607 --> 00:17:15,873
we're experiencing
some difficulties.

334
00:17:15,945 --> 00:17:19,384
I'm going to have to ask you all
to please refrain

335
00:17:19,418 --> 00:17:21,183
from using your imaginations.

336
00:17:21,222 --> 00:17:23,658
Just because you
don't have an imagination

337
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:28,762
don't ruin it
for the rest of us.

338
00:17:28,804 --> 00:17:31,001
Let me guess.

339
00:17:31,042 --> 00:17:35,449
Another clever Federation
experiment has gone awry

340
00:17:35,483 --> 00:17:38,512
and you've turned
the whole station

341
00:17:38,556 --> 00:17:40,719
into one vast holosuite.

342
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:44,599
The phenomenon is being
investigated as we speak.

343
00:17:44,636 --> 00:17:46,127
Uh-huh.

344
00:17:46,172 --> 00:17:49,201
Well, uh, tell them
to take their time.

345
00:17:49,244 --> 00:17:52,614
I haven't had a chance
to show the ladies

346
00:17:52,652 --> 00:17:55,852
my collection
of Tartaran landscapes yet.

347
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:59,125
I'm surprised
by your attitude, Quark.

348
00:17:59,164 --> 00:18:00,564
Ah, yes.

349
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:04,632
Well, you simply don't have
the same appreciation for...

350
00:18:06,646 --> 00:18:08,673
art as I do.

351
00:18:08,717 --> 00:18:10,710
Dabo.

352
00:18:13,627 --> 00:18:17,624
I'm surprised because every one
of your customers is winning.

353
00:18:17,668 --> 00:18:18,795
What?

354
00:18:18,837 --> 00:18:21,069
They're taking you
to the poorhouse.

355
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:22,941
Dabo. Another winner!

356
00:18:23,012 --> 00:18:24,948
No.
No, that's not possible.

357
00:18:24,983 --> 00:18:26,953
Let me through.

358
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,481
Lose. Lose...

359
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,090
One cross...

360
00:18:33,132 --> 00:18:34,761
Two cross.

361
00:18:37,107 --> 00:18:40,136
No! No!

362
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,979
You're outnumbered, Quark.

363
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,715
Pardon me.
Pardon me.

364
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,951
I was afraid of this.

365
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:05,496
The proximity of the wormhole
is amplifying the rupture.

366
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,796
The proton counts
are going through the roof.

367
00:19:07,835 --> 00:19:08,803
Dax to O'Brien.

368
00:19:08,837 --> 00:19:10,932
How are you coming
with that probe, Chief?

369
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,808
I'll have
the subspace scanners programmed

370
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:13,813
in less than an hour.

371
00:19:13,847 --> 00:19:16,375
Keep me informed.
Dax out.

372
00:19:16,418 --> 00:19:18,752
I have the wave
intensity analysis.

373
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,622
Computer, scan all data files

374
00:19:21,663 --> 00:19:23,656
for comparable wave
intensity patterns.

375
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,861
Stand by.

376
00:19:28,744 --> 00:19:30,873
Jadzia...

377
00:19:30,915 --> 00:19:33,010
I find this difficult to say

378
00:19:33,085 --> 00:19:35,555
but I want you to know,
I would...

379
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,756
Julian, there's really
no need to apologize.

380
00:19:38,797 --> 00:19:40,026
In a way

381
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:42,433
I feel as if we've
invaded your privacy.

382
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:46,308
We all have fantasies and dreams
we keep to ourselves...

383
00:19:46,345 --> 00:19:49,715
thoughts
that should remain private.

384
00:19:49,752 --> 00:19:51,220
I'm glad you understand.

385
00:19:51,255 --> 00:19:53,020
Of course I do.

386
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:55,895
I was a young man... once.

387
00:19:55,931 --> 00:19:58,994
So we can put
all this behind us?

388
00:19:59,037 --> 00:20:00,505
Of course.

389
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,701
Good.

390
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:04,236
The computer seems
to be having trouble

391
00:20:04,281 --> 00:20:05,579
finding a match.

392
00:20:05,616 --> 00:20:08,086
She really is submissive,
isn't she?

393
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:10,092
Is that how you want
me to be, Julian?

394
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,755
So submissive?

395
00:20:11,796 --> 00:20:13,789
I am not submissive.

396
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:15,063
Am I?

397
00:20:15,103 --> 00:20:16,970
Uh, no.

398
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,808
Um, uh...
well, I don't think so.

399
00:20:19,846 --> 00:20:22,977
I'm just not the cold fish
you are.

400
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:26,048
Cold fish?

401
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:29,120
Now, I, uh, never said that.

402
00:20:29,231 --> 00:20:32,328
If you'd get down
off your high horse

403
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,772
you'd start
to appreciate Julian.

404
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:36,779
She has a sense of humor

405
00:20:36,813 --> 00:20:38,578
as I've always imagined you do.

406
00:20:38,616 --> 00:20:41,018
I could use one about now.

407
00:20:41,055 --> 00:20:42,148
Come on, Lieutenant.

408
00:20:42,257 --> 00:20:44,625
Stop denying all those
yearnings you feel.

409
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,631
Yearnings?

410
00:20:46,665 --> 00:20:47,997
If you don't

411
00:20:48,035 --> 00:20:50,369
you'll never know
what you missed.

412
00:20:50,406 --> 00:20:51,874
Pattern match found.

413
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,709
Just in the nick of time.

414
00:20:55,483 --> 00:20:57,851
A similar subspace rupture
was reported

415
00:20:57,888 --> 00:21:00,655
in the Hanoli system
in the mid-23rd century.

416
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:01,922
The Hanoli system.

417
00:21:01,963 --> 00:21:03,397
I don't believe
I know where that is.

418
00:21:03,432 --> 00:21:05,402
There's no reason you should.

419
00:21:05,436 --> 00:21:09,467
When the rupture expanded,
the system was destroyed.

420
00:21:19,297 --> 00:21:23,670
Station Log, Stardate 46853.2.

421
00:21:23,706 --> 00:21:26,576
We have launched a probe
to study the subspace anomaly.

422
00:21:26,612 --> 00:21:29,277
Meanwhile, more than half
the people aboard DS9

423
00:21:29,317 --> 00:21:32,483
have reported manifestations
of their imagined thoughts.

424
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:35,462
All probe systems
are reading normal.

425
00:21:35,496 --> 00:21:38,332
Calibrating sensors
for subspace.

426
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:40,601
Three minutes to coordinates.

427
00:21:41,876 --> 00:21:46,146
Wave patterns should begin
fluctuating any time now.

428
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,213
There.

429
00:21:48,322 --> 00:21:51,351
The probe is penetrating
the thoron field.

430
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:54,196
Two and a half minutes
to coordinates.

431
00:21:55,203 --> 00:21:57,605
Ah, for simpler times, eh?

432
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,074
Go away.

433
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,046
I only want to help.

434
00:22:02,317 --> 00:22:05,448
You're in the way.

435
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:11,727
A farmer from Derry
once tried to chase me off

436
00:22:11,768 --> 00:22:15,333
until I saved his crops...
from locusts.

437
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:17,846
Two minutes to coordinates.

438
00:22:17,881 --> 00:22:20,409
Thoron emissions are stable.

439
00:22:20,453 --> 00:22:23,653
You know what I find
most intriguing

440
00:22:23,692 --> 00:22:25,855
about you, my good host?

441
00:22:25,897 --> 00:22:27,388
You're afraid.

442
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,042
Of me.

443
00:22:33,078 --> 00:22:34,546
Look, figment

444
00:22:34,581 --> 00:22:38,612
I'm not afraid of anybody,
least of all you.

445
00:22:38,656 --> 00:22:41,126
90 seconds to coordinates.

446
00:22:41,161 --> 00:22:42,527
Figment, am I?

447
00:22:42,563 --> 00:22:46,002
A figment of my imagination,
that's all.

448
00:22:46,038 --> 00:22:48,601
And yet, you can't deny

449
00:22:48,642 --> 00:22:51,546
how this imagination of yours
empowers me, can you?

450
00:22:51,581 --> 00:22:53,983
Empowers me in a way

451
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,922
that somehow terrifies you.

452
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:59,293
You should be getting
some primary data, Commander.

453
00:22:59,397 --> 00:23:01,867
They're coming in now, Chief.

454
00:23:01,903 --> 00:23:02,962
Stand by.

455
00:23:03,005 --> 00:23:07,002
She is your firstborn,
isn't she?

456
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,489
30 seconds to coordinates.

457
00:23:16,531 --> 00:23:18,609
Thoron emission
patterns unstable.

458
00:23:18,742 --> 00:23:21,008
Probe hull temperature
dropping rapidly.

459
00:23:21,048 --> 00:23:22,539
Ten seconds.

460
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:26,318
The probe's approaching
the perimeter of the anomaly.

461
00:23:26,358 --> 00:23:27,587
That's strange.

462
00:23:27,627 --> 00:23:28,720
What is it?

463
00:23:28,762 --> 00:23:31,495
Negative readings
on all sensors.

464
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:35,498
We may be looking
at some sort of folded space.

465
00:23:35,543 --> 00:23:37,342
Let's see
what the optical scanner

466
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,643
on the probe gives us.

467
00:23:43,192 --> 00:23:47,462
It's drawing in all the matter
from the surrounding space.

468
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,766
Benjamin, it's getting larger.

469
00:23:54,314 --> 00:23:56,443
Feel like taking
a few ground balls?

470
00:23:56,485 --> 00:23:57,714
Look, I tried to tell you

471
00:23:57,754 --> 00:24:00,317
you're on a space station
in the 24th century.

472
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:03,695
The only ball field around
is a holographic simulation.

473
00:24:03,732 --> 00:24:05,634
It's not real,
and neither are you.

474
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:07,639
Oh, you see, I don't get it.

475
00:24:07,673 --> 00:24:09,905
I can pinch myself
and it hurts

476
00:24:09,944 --> 00:24:11,344
and I am here with you,
aren't I?

477
00:24:11,381 --> 00:24:14,012
Right now you are,
but, in a minute, who knows?

478
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:16,250
I hope when we get this thing
figured out, you'll...

479
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:17,782
Disappear for good?

480
00:24:17,827 --> 00:24:18,795
I hope so.

481
00:24:18,896 --> 00:24:19,989
Oh, you do, huh?

482
00:24:20,032 --> 00:24:22,525
Well, so let's just say
for a moment I don't.

483
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,004
So what am I supposed to do,
huh?

484
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,406
You got room on your team

485
00:24:25,442 --> 00:24:27,435
for a switch-hitting
third baseman

486
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,448
with good power?

487
00:24:28,482 --> 00:24:30,315
Good power from the left side.

488
00:24:30,352 --> 00:24:33,347
Left side?
Ben, hey.

489
00:24:33,392 --> 00:24:34,621
Hey, Ben.

490
00:24:34,661 --> 00:24:36,255
What are you talking about?

491
00:24:36,298 --> 00:24:37,824
I hit over 20 homers
right-handed

492
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:40,029
in each of my first three years
in the majors.

493
00:24:40,072 --> 00:24:41,837
And never more
than ten after that.

494
00:24:41,908 --> 00:24:44,641
That was because Old Crow
moved me to second in the order.

495
00:24:44,681 --> 00:24:47,049
I wish I had more time for this.

496
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:51,493
Well, that was baseball's
epitaph, wasn't it?

497
00:24:51,528 --> 00:24:54,364
Nobody seemed to have
time for us anymore.

498
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,529
You know, I could have
played five more years

499
00:24:56,571 --> 00:24:58,507
if they hadn't killed the game.

500
00:24:58,542 --> 00:25:00,671
You were the best
that ever played.

501
00:25:00,713 --> 00:25:01,681
I know.

502
00:25:01,715 --> 00:25:03,480
I've played with them all.

503
00:25:04,988 --> 00:25:06,617
I've got work to do.

504
00:25:06,658 --> 00:25:09,060
Hey, Ben.

505
00:25:09,097 --> 00:25:11,090
It really meant a lot to me...

506
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,432
how much you cared.

507
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,702
That day we won the World Series

508
00:25:14,741 --> 00:25:17,542
there were only 300 people
in the stands.

509
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,846
301 in my version.

510
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,285
I heard you cheering.

511
00:25:22,323 --> 00:25:24,316
Meant a lot to me.

512
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,824
I just thought
you should know, you know

513
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:32,400
in case I do finally disappear.

514
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,783
Ops.

515
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,163
We don't know any more
than when we started.

516
00:25:47,206 --> 00:25:50,701
Why would mine create
a woman and then reject her?

517
00:25:50,746 --> 00:25:54,481
Why would mine create a dwarf
that could terrify him?

518
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,820
We should abandon
the whole thing.

519
00:25:56,858 --> 00:25:57,826
Not yet.

520
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,696
I made a connection with mine.

521
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:01,860
A curious one.

522
00:26:01,901 --> 00:26:03,427
I sense a feeling from him...

523
00:26:03,472 --> 00:26:05,101
an affection for this ballplayer

524
00:26:05,142 --> 00:26:07,578
who died 200 years
before he was even born.

525
00:26:07,613 --> 00:26:08,603
And how much longer

526
00:26:08,648 --> 00:26:10,641
do you suggest
we devote to this?

527
00:26:10,686 --> 00:26:13,351
As long as it takes.

528
00:26:13,392 --> 00:26:17,355
It ain't over till it's over.

529
00:26:25,983 --> 00:26:28,146
Station Log, supplemental.

530
00:26:28,188 --> 00:26:31,024
The subspace anomaly
continues to expand.

531
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:34,898
As of yet, we've been unable
to find a way to contain it.

532
00:26:34,934 --> 00:26:36,095
As a precaution

533
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:38,266
we have diverted
all incoming ships

534
00:26:38,308 --> 00:26:39,640
away from the station.

535
00:26:39,677 --> 00:26:42,205
A Vulcan science mission
to the Hanoli rift

536
00:26:42,249 --> 00:26:45,950
detonated a pulse wave torpedo
at the coordinates of the tear.

537
00:26:45,989 --> 00:26:48,961
Five minutes after they did,
the rupture expanded radically.

538
00:26:49,062 --> 00:26:50,189
They were wiped out

539
00:26:50,232 --> 00:26:52,361
along with the entire
Hanoli system.

540
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:54,839
What happened
to the rupture after that?

541
00:26:54,874 --> 00:26:56,103
It's not still there?

542
00:26:56,144 --> 00:26:58,741
It reached a critical mass point
and imploded

543
00:26:58,782 --> 00:27:01,777
and then disappeared
from normal space altogether.

544
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:03,484
Were there any reports
from the Vulcans

545
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:04,857
about hallucinations on board?

546
00:27:04,894 --> 00:27:07,491
Anything similar
to what we're experiencing?

547
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:09,662
No, sir, but they were
only within range

548
00:27:09,704 --> 00:27:11,195
of the anomaly for 12 hours.

549
00:27:11,241 --> 00:27:14,042
And Vulcans don't have
the most active imaginations.

550
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:15,878
Were there
any explanations offered

551
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:18,148
for the initial cause
of the rupture?

552
00:27:18,188 --> 00:27:19,451
Dozens, nothing confirmed.

553
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,323
But we do know
there were no wormholes

554
00:27:21,361 --> 00:27:23,160
and very little starship
activity

555
00:27:23,198 --> 00:27:24,461
in the area before it formed.

556
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,097
We've looked high and low
for some common ground...

557
00:27:27,138 --> 00:27:30,167
something to give us a fix
on how to attack this thing

558
00:27:30,212 --> 00:27:32,580
and frankly, sir,
as funny as it sounds

559
00:27:32,616 --> 00:27:35,554
we think pulse wave torpedoes
may still be the best approach.

560
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:36,852
Wait a minute.

561
00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:38,793
If it didn't work
very well last time, why...

562
00:27:38,828 --> 00:27:41,162
The Vulcans were using
a primitive device.

563
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,727
In the past 200 years

564
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,901
we've developed far better ways
of controlling the flux density.

565
00:27:45,943 --> 00:27:49,279
We should be able to contain
the internal reaction this time.

566
00:27:49,317 --> 00:27:52,289
And if we can't, we destroy
the whole Bajoran system.

567
00:27:52,323 --> 00:27:54,225
Major, the rupture
is already expanding.

568
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,558
We have to seal it

569
00:27:55,596 --> 00:27:58,032
or it's going to destroy
this system anyway.

570
00:27:58,133 --> 00:28:00,866
The smaller it is,
the better chance we have.

571
00:28:00,906 --> 00:28:03,537
How long will it take to create
one of these torpedoes?

572
00:28:03,578 --> 00:28:06,071
We could have one ready
by 2200 hours.

573
00:28:06,116 --> 00:28:08,679
If the rift expands at all
before imploding

574
00:28:08,722 --> 00:28:10,156
we have to be prepared.

575
00:28:10,192 --> 00:28:12,162
Route auxiliary power
to shields.

576
00:28:12,196 --> 00:28:13,596
Major, I'd like for you

577
00:28:13,632 --> 00:28:16,000
to coordinate evacuation
of the pylons.

578
00:28:16,103 --> 00:28:17,128
Odo can help you.

579
00:28:17,171 --> 00:28:18,902
Dismissed.

580
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,545
Kira to Odo.

581
00:28:25,589 --> 00:28:26,750
What is it, Major?

582
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:29,354
I need you to do a security
sweep through the pylons.

583
00:28:29,397 --> 00:28:30,763
We're going to evacuate them.

584
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:34,205
I'll get on it
as soon as possible.

585
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,731
I've got my hands full
right now.

586
00:28:35,776 --> 00:28:36,744
Clear the way!

587
00:28:36,778 --> 00:28:38,543
Get out of the corridor.
Let them through.

588
00:28:38,581 --> 00:28:39,879
Clear the way now!

589
00:28:51,307 --> 00:28:52,536
Kira to Ops.

590
00:28:52,576 --> 00:28:54,341
Lower Pylon 1 is gone.

591
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,814
I need emergency...

592
00:29:04,266 --> 00:29:06,031
Sisko to Kira.
Report.

593
00:29:06,103 --> 00:29:07,936
Kira, can you read me?

594
00:29:11,714 --> 00:29:14,413
Major Kira, report.

595
00:29:17,693 --> 00:29:19,629
Disregard, Commander.

596
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,772
False alarm.

597
00:29:24,807 --> 00:29:26,470
Kira out.

598
00:29:45,348 --> 00:29:50,381
All personnel in Lower Pylon 1,
report to Outer Ring Airlock.

599
00:29:50,425 --> 00:29:52,361
Prepare for evacuation.

600
00:29:54,098 --> 00:29:55,123
Clear the way now.

601
00:29:55,234 --> 00:29:56,133
Clear the way.

602
00:29:56,236 --> 00:29:57,465
Please stay inside.

603
00:29:57,506 --> 00:29:58,474
This isn't a show.

604
00:29:58,508 --> 00:29:59,476
Odo!

605
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,478
You, get out of the way!

606
00:30:00,512 --> 00:30:02,345
Odo! Odo!

607
00:30:02,382 --> 00:30:03,501
Odo!

608
00:30:03,634 --> 00:30:04,499
Odo! Odo!

609
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:05,765
Thank goodness.

610
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:07,536
I want to report
two missing persons...

611
00:30:07,576 --> 00:30:08,737
a blonde and a brunette.

612
00:30:08,778 --> 00:30:09,746
Can't you see I'm busy?

613
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,975
Don't scare them.

614
00:30:11,015 --> 00:30:14,215
One minute, they're whispering
sweet nothings in my ear.

615
00:30:14,255 --> 00:30:16,589
The next minute,
the sweet nothings are gone.

616
00:30:16,627 --> 00:30:18,494
Will you get off
the street, before...

617
00:30:21,503 --> 00:30:22,835
Girls!

618
00:30:22,872 --> 00:30:26,903
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

619
00:30:26,947 --> 00:30:30,317
Don't ever do that to me again.

620
00:30:30,355 --> 00:30:32,587
So, Odo, what have you

621
00:30:32,626 --> 00:30:35,962
conjured up
during all this, hmm?

622
00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:37,866
Me?

623
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:39,963
I should have guessed...
nothing at all.

624
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:42,239
I've spent all my time

625
00:30:42,277 --> 00:30:45,808
chasing incarnations
of the Prophets

626
00:30:45,852 --> 00:30:48,881
long-dead lovers,
Gunji jackdaws

627
00:30:48,924 --> 00:30:51,087
blizzards, trollops...

628
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:52,529
Ah!

629
00:30:52,565 --> 00:30:56,403
As I always said,
a man without any imagination.

630
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,171
Come along, my dears.

631
00:30:58,209 --> 00:31:02,343
I'll show you what
a fertile imagination can do.

632
00:31:09,198 --> 00:31:10,188
Imagination...

633
00:31:12,505 --> 00:31:16,843
Computer, run a level-1
personnel sweep of all pylons.

634
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,909
Requested function will take
approximately three minutes.

635
00:31:24,896 --> 00:31:30,807
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!

636
00:31:30,842 --> 00:31:32,903
Get the Nagus on subspace.

637
00:31:32,946 --> 00:31:35,918
I want to talk to him,
and I mean now!

638
00:31:37,422 --> 00:31:40,826
I'm not spending another minute
in this cell.

639
00:31:40,862 --> 00:31:42,661
How did you get in there?

640
00:31:42,699 --> 00:31:45,364
How did I get in here?

641
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,703
You put me in here.

642
00:31:47,742 --> 00:31:50,407
Oh...

643
00:31:50,448 --> 00:31:52,350
I guess I did, didn't I?

644
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,479
Yeah.

645
00:31:56,994 --> 00:31:59,898
No imagination indeed. Ha!

646
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:21,207
Heads up, Jake.

647
00:32:21,242 --> 00:32:22,973
So, what are you doing here?

648
00:32:23,012 --> 00:32:24,879
I can't go.
I've got homework to do.

649
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:26,852
But you'd rather be
at the ballpark.

650
00:32:26,887 --> 00:32:27,980
You don't understand.

651
00:32:28,022 --> 00:32:30,458
If I go to the holosuite
without finishing my homework

652
00:32:30,494 --> 00:32:31,462
my dad'll kill me.

653
00:32:31,496 --> 00:32:32,555
Kill you?

654
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:33,794
Yeah.

655
00:32:33,834 --> 00:32:36,465
You really believe
he'd kill you?

656
00:32:36,506 --> 00:32:38,237
I know he would.

657
00:32:38,276 --> 00:32:39,539
Well, if that's true

658
00:32:39,579 --> 00:32:41,811
why you still thinking
about going?

659
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,547
I'm trying not to.

660
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:45,489
But you're wondering

661
00:32:45,524 --> 00:32:47,721
if you can get away with it,
aren't you?

662
00:32:47,762 --> 00:32:49,459
Well?

663
00:32:49,499 --> 00:32:53,200
I couldn't understand
the directions.

664
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:58,648
The computer accidentally erased
the instruction page.

665
00:32:58,684 --> 00:33:02,419
You really expect me
to believe that?

666
00:33:02,457 --> 00:33:05,122
No, I guess not.

667
00:33:07,969 --> 00:33:10,668
I've really got homework to do.

668
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:28,935
I need to see you, Benjamin.

669
00:33:30,514 --> 00:33:31,914
What do you have, Dax?

670
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:35,583
In the last hour alone,
the rupture's expanded 27%.

671
00:33:35,624 --> 00:33:37,890
The rate of expansion
is increasing.

672
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:40,696
Can we gain any time
by moving the station?

673
00:33:40,735 --> 00:33:42,067
If the rift collapses

674
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:45,304
the implosion would overtake us
almost immediately.

675
00:33:45,343 --> 00:33:47,472
How soon can you
be ready, Chief?

676
00:33:47,514 --> 00:33:49,211
I'm installing
pulse wave devices

677
00:33:49,251 --> 00:33:50,948
in the torpedoes now,
Commander.

678
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:52,456
Six, seven minutes.

679
00:33:52,491 --> 00:33:55,930
The rift's gotten large enough
to pick up on visual scanners.

680
00:33:55,965 --> 00:33:56,955
On screen.

681
00:34:00,073 --> 00:34:02,373
Magnify.

682
00:34:52,577 --> 00:34:53,704
All pylons are secured.

683
00:34:53,747 --> 00:34:55,717
Everyone's been moved
to the Habitat Ring

684
00:34:55,751 --> 00:34:57,516
for the time being.

685
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:58,715
You're worried.

686
00:34:58,757 --> 00:34:59,884
You bet I am.

687
00:34:59,926 --> 00:35:01,155
If this doesn't work

688
00:35:01,195 --> 00:35:04,326
nothing real or imagined
is going to survive.

689
00:35:04,401 --> 00:35:07,100
Hold me.

690
00:35:08,777 --> 00:35:10,268
Please.

691
00:35:12,584 --> 00:35:13,882
Torpedoes ready.

692
00:35:13,921 --> 00:35:15,788
Status of shields?

693
00:35:15,824 --> 00:35:18,523
All available power's
been transferred.

694
00:35:18,563 --> 00:35:21,763
Reading shield strength
at 158% above normal.

695
00:35:21,803 --> 00:35:23,602
Let's hope it's enough.

696
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,938
Red Alert.

697
00:35:24,976 --> 00:35:26,342
Fire!

698
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,786
All systems functioning
properly.

699
00:35:33,827 --> 00:35:36,628
Torpedo guidance
is on nominal track.

700
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:38,966
30 seconds to coordinates.

701
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:41,669
Impulse sustainer
throttling down.

702
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,907
Arming pulse wave initiator.

703
00:35:43,947 --> 00:35:46,315
Torpedo hull temperature
dropping.

704
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,912
Activating pulse waves.

705
00:35:47,955 --> 00:35:51,018
Compression level at 1,400
and rising.

706
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:52,552
20 seconds.

707
00:35:52,597 --> 00:35:55,090
Compression at 2,900.

708
00:35:55,136 --> 00:35:56,627
3,000.

709
00:35:56,673 --> 00:35:58,734
Terminal targeting spread
confirmed.

710
00:35:58,777 --> 00:36:00,542
3,500.

711
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,946
Holding compression.

712
00:36:01,983 --> 00:36:03,110
Ten seconds.

713
00:36:03,152 --> 00:36:04,381
Ready to detonate.

714
00:36:04,488 --> 00:36:05,683
Ready, sir.

715
00:36:05,724 --> 00:36:07,090
Five seconds.

716
00:36:07,127 --> 00:36:08,288
Now.

717
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:15,873
Wave intensity
from the rift is dropping.

718
00:36:15,911 --> 00:36:18,974
The thoron field boundary
is shrinking.

719
00:36:19,017 --> 00:36:20,782
Particle energy is rising.

720
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:23,752
Wait a minute.
What's this?

721
00:36:23,794 --> 00:36:25,057
Wave emissions are fluctuating.

722
00:36:25,096 --> 00:36:27,157
We're not getting
a controlled collapse.

723
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,361
Chief?

724
00:36:28,402 --> 00:36:31,067
Damn it, we're picking up
an exothermic reaction pattern.

725
00:36:31,108 --> 00:36:33,340
It may be neutralizing
the pulse waves.

726
00:36:33,379 --> 00:36:34,677
Stand by.

727
00:36:34,716 --> 00:36:37,381
Perimeter sensors are picking up
a subspace oscillation.

728
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,820
What the hell does that mean?

729
00:36:38,857 --> 00:36:40,952
Proton counts have tripled.

730
00:36:40,994 --> 00:36:43,115
Residual pulse wave activity
from our torpedoes

731
00:36:43,248 --> 00:36:44,477
is down to 14%.

732
00:36:44,517 --> 00:36:47,512
The flux density readings
inside the rupture

733
00:36:47,557 --> 00:36:49,186
are off the scale.

734
00:37:00,349 --> 00:37:03,810
Odo to Ops!

735
00:37:03,856 --> 00:37:06,019
Ops! Ops!

736
00:37:10,035 --> 00:37:12,666
Com circuits are down.

737
00:37:12,707 --> 00:37:15,338
I'll try to reroute pathways.

738
00:37:15,379 --> 00:37:17,008
Life support is normal.

739
00:37:17,049 --> 00:37:18,108
Shields.

740
00:37:18,218 --> 00:37:19,089
A generator's down.

741
00:37:19,222 --> 00:37:20,713
Section Four is exposed.

742
00:37:20,826 --> 00:37:22,124
Odo to Ops.

743
00:37:22,162 --> 00:37:23,289
There we go.

744
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:25,266
Constable, check for casualties.

745
00:37:25,301 --> 00:37:28,171
Have your deputies move
everybody out of Section Four.

746
00:37:28,207 --> 00:37:29,402
We have shield damage.

747
00:37:29,442 --> 00:37:30,467
Acknowledged.

748
00:37:30,511 --> 00:37:31,945
What are we getting
from the rift?

749
00:37:31,981 --> 00:37:33,746
Sensors aren't operating.

750
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:35,446
Stand by, sir.

751
00:37:37,793 --> 00:37:39,763
I can't feel my hands.

752
00:37:39,864 --> 00:37:41,629
Lie still, lie still.

753
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:46,005
There's an emergency medical kit
in the cabinet there.

754
00:37:46,043 --> 00:37:47,204
Get it.

755
00:37:48,581 --> 00:37:50,175
I'm sorry...

756
00:37:50,218 --> 00:37:52,085
Shh.

757
00:37:52,121 --> 00:37:54,148
Here you go.

758
00:37:54,192 --> 00:37:56,959
I never meant to bother you.

759
00:37:56,998 --> 00:37:58,797
No, no.

760
00:37:58,835 --> 00:38:01,203
You didn't bother me.

761
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,644
I can't keep my eyes open.

762
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:06,478
Don't close your eyes.

763
00:38:06,516 --> 00:38:07,745
I want you awake.

764
00:38:07,853 --> 00:38:10,346
You have a nasty concussion.

765
00:38:12,528 --> 00:38:14,760
I can't help it.

766
00:38:14,867 --> 00:38:16,165
Dax.

767
00:38:16,203 --> 00:38:17,330
Dax!

768
00:38:17,372 --> 00:38:18,772
Sensors are back on line.

769
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:20,173
The rupture is continuing

770
00:38:20,211 --> 00:38:23,342
to widen... 340 times larger
than before.

771
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,251
Is it showing
any signs of collapsing?

772
00:38:25,288 --> 00:38:28,283
Wave emissions from the rift
are still fluctuating.

773
00:38:28,327 --> 00:38:30,763
I can't make any sense
out of these readings.

774
00:38:30,798 --> 00:38:32,893
Proton counts are lower
than before.

775
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,803
And now
they're beginning to rise again.

776
00:38:34,907 --> 00:38:36,934
The pulse waves
from our torpedoes

777
00:38:36,978 --> 00:38:38,344
have been completely
neutralized.

778
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,473
It's just a matter of time

779
00:38:39,516 --> 00:38:41,179
before the rift
starts expanding again.

780
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:42,380
How much time?

781
00:38:42,422 --> 00:38:43,549
Minutes.

782
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,888
Suggestions.

783
00:38:49,102 --> 00:38:52,837
Run out of ideas, friend?

784
00:38:52,943 --> 00:38:54,606
I have a suggestion.

785
00:38:54,646 --> 00:38:56,275
Maybe I can help.

786
00:38:56,316 --> 00:38:57,215
You?

787
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,221
You created me with powers

788
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:01,248
beyond those of mortal men

789
00:39:01,293 --> 00:39:05,700
and I would be more than happy
to use them to assist you.

790
00:39:05,735 --> 00:39:07,398
For a price.

791
00:39:12,715 --> 00:39:15,083
I've always wanted a daughter.

792
00:39:15,121 --> 00:39:16,555
Miles?

793
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,024
Perimeter sensors are picking up

794
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,825
subspace oscillations again.

795
00:39:19,897 --> 00:39:22,333
You're telling me you can seal
that rupture out there?

796
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:25,135
I can spin straw into gold,
my friend.

797
00:39:25,174 --> 00:39:27,235
This seems no more difficult.

798
00:39:27,278 --> 00:39:29,009
Well, do it, damn it!

799
00:39:29,048 --> 00:39:31,143
Will you meet my price?

800
00:39:31,186 --> 00:39:33,851
This is crazy.

801
00:39:33,958 --> 00:39:38,194
You're out of a storybook,
a fairy tale.

802
00:39:38,233 --> 00:39:41,866
Are you willing to give her up
to save so many others?

803
00:39:41,974 --> 00:39:43,534
No.

804
00:39:43,577 --> 00:39:44,875
He doesn't have to.

805
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,781
Dax, when did our sensors

806
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:49,789
first pick up traces
of the rupture?

807
00:39:49,823 --> 00:39:50,882
You were there, Benjamin.

808
00:39:50,959 --> 00:39:52,393
When we were first
trying to figure

809
00:39:52,428 --> 00:39:53,396
this whole thing out.

810
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,728
And if I remember correctly

811
00:39:54,766 --> 00:39:56,668
you said
that your previous scans

812
00:39:56,703 --> 00:39:58,696
hadn't picked up
any anomalies at all.

813
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,676
I thought whatever was out there

814
00:40:00,711 --> 00:40:03,308
was too small for the scanners
to identify.

815
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:06,151
So you imagined
that we had a subspace rupture

816
00:40:06,189 --> 00:40:08,888
and that's exactly
what it turned out to be.

817
00:40:08,928 --> 00:40:11,661
That is what I imagined.

818
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,670
And once you'd learned
about the rift

819
00:40:13,704 --> 00:40:15,674
that destroyed the Hanoli system

820
00:40:15,708 --> 00:40:18,942
we all imagined that we might
have another just like it.

821
00:40:18,982 --> 00:40:20,849
Mr. O'Brien, drop the shields.

822
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:21,944
Sir?

823
00:40:22,054 --> 00:40:23,751
There is no rupture.

824
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:27,855
There is no threat
to this station, or this system.

825
00:40:27,899 --> 00:40:30,369
End Red Alert
and drop the shields.

826
00:40:30,404 --> 00:40:32,967
Aye, sir.

827
00:40:33,076 --> 00:40:35,239
And believe it, Mr. O'Brien.

828
00:40:35,281 --> 00:40:37,717
It's important
that you believe it.

829
00:40:37,752 --> 00:40:39,688
Aye, sir.

830
00:40:39,722 --> 00:40:42,626
Are your sensors picking up
any magnetic shock waves, Major?

831
00:40:42,662 --> 00:40:43,891
Yes, sir.

832
00:40:43,931 --> 00:40:45,992
Perimeter readings still show...

833
00:40:46,102 --> 00:40:48,095
No shock waves at all.

834
00:40:50,444 --> 00:40:51,639
None at all.

835
00:40:55,721 --> 00:40:57,850
Lieutenant, proton counts.

836
00:40:57,892 --> 00:41:00,089
Normal.

837
00:41:04,138 --> 00:41:05,572
It's gone.

838
00:41:05,608 --> 00:41:09,708
You're going to be fine.

839
00:41:09,749 --> 00:41:11,878
Of course I am.

840
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,086
I have the best doctor
in the galaxy.

841
00:41:21,906 --> 00:41:24,240
None of this makes any sense.

842
00:41:24,278 --> 00:41:28,013
I mean, why did they appear
in the first place?

843
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:29,349
It might still be related

844
00:41:29,389 --> 00:41:31,154
to the elevated thoron emissions
in the plasma field.

845
00:41:31,192 --> 00:41:33,789
The readings still
haven't returned to normal.

846
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,766
Continue your analysis, Dax

847
00:41:35,801 --> 00:41:38,534
but, this time, no speculations

848
00:41:38,573 --> 00:41:39,939
just facts.

849
00:41:39,976 --> 00:41:41,308
Yes, Benjamin.

850
00:41:41,346 --> 00:41:44,443
Major, keep us on Yellow Alert
for the next 26 hours

851
00:41:44,485 --> 00:41:48,050
till we see that everything
is back to normal.

852
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,064
Chief, take your family home.

853
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:52,429
That's an order.

854
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,165
Aye, sir.

855
00:42:27,338 --> 00:42:29,672
This imagination of yours...

856
00:42:29,709 --> 00:42:31,177
it's a tough concept

857
00:42:31,212 --> 00:42:33,512
for us to get a handle on, Ben.

858
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:36,545
You're not simply a figment
of my imagination, are you?

859
00:42:36,589 --> 00:42:39,993
We're on an extended mission
exploring the galaxy.

860
00:42:40,029 --> 00:42:42,090
A while back,
we followed one of your ships

861
00:42:42,201 --> 00:42:43,932
through that hole in space
out there.

862
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:45,404
We've been watching you.

863
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,535
Trying to figure out
the rules of your game.

864
00:42:47,578 --> 00:42:50,675
Why didn't you just
talk to us like this?

865
00:42:50,717 --> 00:42:52,117
Well, we've learned
that you can never tell

866
00:42:52,221 --> 00:42:54,589
how someone will treat
the visiting team.

867
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:56,618
I understand.

868
00:42:56,663 --> 00:42:59,133
That's what this has been
all about...

869
00:42:59,168 --> 00:43:00,728
learning to understand.

870
00:43:00,771 --> 00:43:02,570
Was it really necessary

871
00:43:02,608 --> 00:43:05,478
to put the whole station
in jeopardy?

872
00:43:05,514 --> 00:43:08,486
But we didn't, Ben.

873
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,353
It was you.

874
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:13,658
It was your imaginations
that created everything.

875
00:43:13,697 --> 00:43:16,828
We were just watching
to see where it took you.

876
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:19,238
Oh, this imagination of yours.

877
00:43:19,275 --> 00:43:22,111
We have never seen
anything like it.

878
00:43:22,214 --> 00:43:24,343
It's very real to all of you

879
00:43:24,385 --> 00:43:26,014
but yet it's not.

880
00:43:26,054 --> 00:43:28,524
At first, it seemed to us
to be a curse

881
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,858
an irritation.

882
00:43:29,896 --> 00:43:32,868
That Odo fellow
even called it a waste of time.

883
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:34,531
I disagree with him.

884
00:43:34,572 --> 00:43:36,040
I knew you would.

885
00:43:36,074 --> 00:43:37,907
I learned that about you.

886
00:43:37,945 --> 00:43:40,040
That you could have
such an affection

887
00:43:40,082 --> 00:43:41,448
for someone you never even met.

888
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:44,321
I wonder if you appreciate

889
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:48,526
how unique that imagination
of yours really is.

890
00:43:50,938 --> 00:43:52,771
Not always.

891
00:43:52,808 --> 00:43:54,539
We got to go.

892
00:43:54,578 --> 00:43:58,484
But you haven't told us anything
about your species.

893
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,854
I'd like to.

894
00:44:00,891 --> 00:44:02,884
Maybe next year.
