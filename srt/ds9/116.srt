1
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,884
Can't you ever
just let go?

2
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,260
Let go?

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,179
The place is almost deserted.

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,015
There hasn't been a ship in
for three days

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,642
and yet you sit there

6
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:19,353
like a Baneriam hawk
looking for prey.

7
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,647
This is your chance to relax.

8
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:23,148
I could set you up

9
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,942
with a terrific
holosuite program.

10
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:27,152
Thank you,
but I don't accept gifts

11
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,529
from the likes of you.

12
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,489
Who said anything
about gifts?

13
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,407
You pay like
everyone else.

14
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,576
I'm just trying to get
you into the tent.

15
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,161
I have no time
for fantasies.

16
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,913
No imagination,
huh?

17
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,540
A waste of time.

18
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,416
Too many people dream
of places they'll never go

19
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,794
wish for things
they'll never have

20
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,713
instead of paying
adequate attention

21
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,046
to their real lives.

22
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,090
I could create

23
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,844
a shape-shifter
playmate for you.

24
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:56,097
The two of you could,
uh... intermingle.

25
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,766
You're disgusting.

26
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,728
It's a living.

27
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,942
You're not allowing
young Mr. Sisko

28
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:08,861
in your holosuites, I hope.

29
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,445
It's not
what you think.

30
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,822
It better not be.

31
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:13,782
You see that thing
on his hand?

32
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,910
It's a baseball mitten.

33
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,913
Every afternoon,
the boy goes up to play.

34
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:21,832
His father brought a program
with famous players.

35
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,959
You ever hear
of Tris Speaker

36
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:27,671
or Ted Williams
or Buck Bokai?

37
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:28,923
Afraid not.

38
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:30,549
Neither did I

39
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,843
until I made it my
business to find out.

40
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:35,763
With all these
humans coming now

41
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,765
the true entrepreneur

42
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:41,476
knows how to...
sniff the wind.

43
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,978
Try it.

44
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,145
Go ahead.

45
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,314
I have no sense of smell.

46
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:49,651
You don't need one
to detect the scent

47
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,946
of op-por-tunity.

48
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:54,489
(<i> derisively</i> ):
Opportunity.

49
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,409
Family entertainment.

50
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:58,994
That's the future, Odo.

51
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,080
There's a fortune
to be made.

52
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,665
Little holocreatures
running around.

53
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,960
Rides and games
for the kiddies.

54
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,087
Ferengis standing
in every doorway

55
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:10,672
selling...
useless souvenirs.

56
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,091
You're going
to replace

57
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:14,635
all your sexual
holoprograms

58
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,470
with family
entertainment?

59
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,471
No, no.

60
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,056
No. I'm expanding.

61
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,976
I'm negotiating
to lease the space next door

62
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:24,061
so I can use
the same hologenerators.

63
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,063
Well, you're
still disgusting.

64
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,565
Till the day I die.

65
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:31,944
I'm sure
you're exaggerating.

66
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:34,446
You are constantly
in my thoughts.

67
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,281
I can't even...

68
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,200
WAITER:
That was two<i> raktajinos,</i>
extra strong.

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,829
I can't even concentrate.

70
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:45,332
You seemed to be
concentrating just fine

71
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,877
on the Junior Lieutenant
at the reception

72
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,629
for Captain Stadius.

73
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:54,173
She was a poor
substitute for you.

74
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:59,888
And the Betazoid envoy
who was here last week.

75
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:03,182
A... barely...

76
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:06,269
adequate substitute
for you.

77
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:10,691
Julian, you are
a wonderful friend.

78
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,901
(<i> groaning</i> )

79
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,696
I enjoy the time
we spend together.

80
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,280
Stop.

81
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,367
You're driving a stake
through my heart.

82
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,457
Try a high-pitched
sonic shower.

83
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,292
It will make
you feel better.

84
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,795
No, it won't.

85
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,213
I've already tried it.

86
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,308
Sorry I'm late.

87
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,310
I was having dinner with Julian.

88
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,396
SISKO:
How is our
young doctor?

89
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,898
Young.

90
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,691
Anything going on?

91
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,360
We were just looking
at an unusual
energy reading.

92
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:59,823
Elevated thoron emissions
in the plasma field.

93
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,242
We thought it might be
an environmental byproduct

94
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,369
created by the increased
traffic in this area.

95
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,080
It could be.

96
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,498
Ships have always avoided
the Denorios Belt.

97
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,584
And we have no idea
how the presence

98
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,878
of so many warp
and impulse engines

99
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:13,921
might affect it.

100
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,547
The question is--

101
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,340
is this going
to cause us any problems?

102
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,761
We were hoping
you could tell us.

103
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,183
O'BRIEN:
"...and the messenger
from the queen

104
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:29,186
"watched the little man as he
danced and sang and laughed.

105
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,689
"How he would soon have
the daughter he always wanted

106
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:36,026
because they would never guess
that his name was...?"

107
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,778
Rumpelstiltskin.

108
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,571
"Rumpelstiltskin."

109
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:40,989
Right.

110
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,574
"And the next day

111
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,367
"when the little man
came and asked

112
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:48,622
"'Now, Mrs. Queen,
what is my name?'

113
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:54,669
"She said, at first, 'Well,
are you called, um... Jack?'

114
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,713
"'No,' he answered.

115
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,967
"'Are you called Harry?'

116
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,636
"'No,' he answered.

117
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:06,223
"And then she said,
'Then perhaps

118
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,808
'your name is...?'"

119
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:08,809
Rumpelstiltskin!

120
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,435
"'Rumpelstiltskin.'

121
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,812
"And, at the sound

122
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,272
"of his own name

123
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:15,565
"the old man was so furious

124
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:19,569
"that he stamped his foot,
shaking the entire kingdom

125
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,697
"and he broke in two
and disappeared

126
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,784
"and the king and the queen
and their daughter

127
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:29,329
lived happily ever after."

128
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,831
Good night, little one.

129
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,668
Sweet dreams.

130
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,170
I'm not tired.

131
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,629
Ah, ah, ah.

132
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:38,880
None of that.

133
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,051
Good night,
sweetheart.

134
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,352
Now, then,
shall I tuck you in

135
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,147
with a bedtime
story, too?

136
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,816
Mmm! Only if you're
tucked in with me.

137
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,442
Mmm. Naturally.

138
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,239
Mommy?

139
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,700
What is it, honey?

140
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,493
He's in my room.

141
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,495
Who?

142
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,497
Rumpelstiltskin.

143
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,710
Sweetheart...

144
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,213
that was just
make-believe.

145
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:22,841
Rumpelstiltskin
isn't real, okay?

146
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,467
All right.

147
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,762
I'll come in and check,
but then it's bedtime.

148
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,723
Why do we tell her stories

149
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:33,392
about evil dwarfs
that want to steal children?

150
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,234
Well, don't look so distraught.

151
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:43,278
I'm only here
to offer you my services

152
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,822
if you should need them.

153
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,654
Take her out of here.

154
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,072
What's wrong?

155
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,284
Miles, what...?

156
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,618
Please, just go.

157
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:00,081
A pity you're sending
the ladies away.

158
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,710
It's as if all the life
just went out of the room.

159
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,421
O'Brien to Security.

160
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:07,464
Go ahead.

161
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,132
Intruder alert.

162
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,384
Send a team
to my quarters
immediately.

163
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:11,968
On our way, Chief.

164
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,105
So where's the straw?

165
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:27,484
I assume you want gold
spun from straw.

166
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,110
What are you?

167
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,696
Well, surely you must know.

168
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,408
You were just telling
the little one all about me.

169
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:38,412
I know what you look like,
but you're<i> not...</i>

170
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,038
Ah! Don't say it.

171
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,457
I don't like the sound of it,
you know.

172
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,502
Rumpelstiltskin.

173
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,462
Now, you didn't think

174
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,798
that would make me break in two
and disappear, did you?

175
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,551
Not this time.

176
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:55,178
I learned my lesson
back in the kingdom.

177
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,764
I don't make deals
like that anymore.

178
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,516
(<i> door opening</i> )

179
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,601
Ah, the local
constabularies.

180
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,604
Gents, show me
a small bit of courtesy

181
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,523
and I'll be very pleasant

182
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,066
but try and lay
a hand on me

183
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,609
and you'll soon
regret it.

184
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,904
Besides, I'm much
too fast for you.

185
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:16,657
And now, my good host

186
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,618
if gold is not your pleasure

187
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,621
tell me your needs
and I'll tell you my price.

188
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,706
O'Brien to Sisko.

189
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,333
Go ahead, Chief.

190
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,668
I need you in my quarters
on the double.

191
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,045
I'm on my way.

192
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,340
Dad, I've got
to talk to you.

193
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,509
Now, Jake, I don't
have time. I'm...

194
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,843
(<i> clearing throat</i> )

195
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,846
Hello, Ben.

196
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,724
He followed me home
from the holosuite.

197
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,734
(<i> moaning</i> )

198
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,618
Mmm...

199
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:02,329
(<i> chuckling</i> )

200
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,463
(<i> gasps</i> )

201
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:12,506
Jadzia!

202
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:13,672
Hello, Julian.

203
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,175
What are you doing here?

204
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,551
Watching you.

205
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,927
Waiting for you
to wake up.

206
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,346
I'm awake.

207
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,055
Is something wrong?

208
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,933
Funny, I was about
to ask you the same question.

209
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,684
It... it...

210
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:29,772
must be this Larosian virus
that's been going around.

211
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,191
How do you feel?

212
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,733
Wonderful.

213
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,860
Um...

214
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,902
Mmm...

215
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,737
No... no fever.

216
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,114
Uh... must be me.

217
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,115
Must be me.

218
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,534
Must be me.

219
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,661
Uh... must be
an allergic reaction

220
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:45,746
to the replicated antipasto
I had at lunch.

221
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,914
Perhaps...

222
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,625
I must be hallucinating.

223
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,751
Why are you
fighting this?

224
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,753
Why am I fighting this?

225
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,256
Why... am I fighting this?

226
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:03,139
I have no good answer
to that question.

227
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,269
KIRA:
All senior officers
report to Ops immediately.

228
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,354
Okay.

229
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,147
I get it.

230
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,524
Very funny.

231
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,192
Did O'Brien
put you up to this?

232
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,570
I don't know what
you're talking about.

233
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,405
"Senior officers to Ops."

234
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,114
We all walk in

235
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,367
everybody has
a good laugh
at my expense.

236
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,118
This is not
a joke, Julian.

237
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,662
We'll see.

238
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,419
SISKO:
Ah. Good.

239
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:35,338
It seems we have
a small mystery on our hands.

240
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,549
Lieutenant Jadzia Dax
and Dr. Julian Bashir

241
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:39,467
I'd like you
to meet Harmon Bokai

242
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,011
a baseball player
from the London Kings
who's been dead

243
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,555
for 200 years.

244
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:44,931
Don't look at me.

245
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,600
I can't figure it out
either.

246
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,767
And a medieval
fairy tale character

247
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,270
named Rumpelstiltskin.

248
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,563
Oh, fine.

249
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:53,314
Now everyone knows my name.

250
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,484
Until today, he only
existed in storybooks.

251
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,528
A pleasure,
I'm... I'm sure.

252
00:12:58,528 --> 00:12:59,862
Could this be related

253
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,156
to the increased
thoron emissions

254
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,533
in the plasma field?

255
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,078
Thoron emissions?

256
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:10,498
I think you'd better ask me,
Benjamin.

257
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,518
I was hitting a few to the boy.

258
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,854
He's really been moving well
under the ball lately, Ben.

259
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,107
We would have worked
on some baserunning

260
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,652
except, uh... well,
he was getting hungry

261
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,069
and I realized
I was, too.

262
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,862
A hologram
with an appetite?

263
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,948
Hologram?

264
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,575
BASHIR:
On the contrary,
Major.

265
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,034
He's quite real.

266
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,036
They all seem to be.

267
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,664
What the hell
they talking about, Ben?

268
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:59,005
You. You're not
actually Buck Bokai.

269
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,758
So how come
I'm wearing his uniform?

270
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,427
You're a holographic image
of Buck Bokai that I created

271
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,471
so Jake and I could
play ball with you.

272
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,473
But I remember.

273
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,475
I remember all the games.

274
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,059
All the opening days.

275
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:15,313
The homer
that won the '42 World Series.

276
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:18,149
The squeaker that went
under Eddie Newson's glove.

277
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:21,194
The day I broke
DiMaggio's consecutive streak.

278
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,863
I programmed it
into the computer--

279
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,491
all of it-- every statistic.

280
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,243
What foreign tongue
are they speaking?

281
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,371
This one
didn't come out

282
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,997
of any holosuite.

283
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,999
But he did come out
of your imagination

284
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,001
just as Buck
came out of Jake's.

285
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,128
<i>His</i> imagination?

286
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:43,800
Then I must have come out
of<i> your</i> imagination, Julian.

287
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,427
Uh... not necessarily.

288
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,179
Well...

289
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,514
maybe.

290
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,432
How could this
sort of thing

291
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,933
possibly happen?

292
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,894
A subspace disruption.

293
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,731
Maybe some kind
of dimensional shift.

294
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,692
I didn't see an anomaly
when I scanned the plasma field

295
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:03,570
but it could have been so small
the sensors missed it.

296
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,072
Julian, let's go
to your quarters.

297
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,449
Please.
I haven't got time for this.

298
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,746
Odo to Sisko.

299
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,372
Go ahead.

300
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,956
Is there something
you want to tell me?

301
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,667
I'm in no mood
for games, Constable.

302
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,335
What do you need?

303
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,504
Are the environmental controls
broken down?

304
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,339
It's snowing on the Promenade.

305
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,132
Snowing?

306
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,760
We're looking at five
or six centimeters down here.

307
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,636
Bring in
all available security, Odo.

308
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,471
We're going to Yellow Alert.

309
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,265
What's going on?

310
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,141
It seems we're letting
our imaginations run wild.

311
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:37,103
As soon as I have an
explanation, I'll give you one.

312
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,563
Sisko out.

313
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:39,980
Yellow Alert?

314
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,357
Against our own
imaginations?

315
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,359
You have
a better idea?

316
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,071
DAX:
I think I've
got something.

317
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,074
Look at the wave patterns
of the plasma field.

318
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,535
The wave fronts are converging
toward a single point.

319
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,914
The particle density rises
as you get closer to the center

320
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,832
but then it looks like it
just drops off completely.

321
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,834
O'BRIEN:
You're right.

322
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,044
I'm not getting any particulate
readings from the core.

323
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,588
What does that mean?

324
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:07,133
Whatever falls in
there is just gone.

325
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,635
You were right.

326
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,178
It is some kind
of subspace disruption.

327
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,972
I want a full analysis.

328
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,057
Chief,
get a class-4 probe ready.

329
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,517
Aye, sir.

330
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,061
Is there anything
I can do to help?

331
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,524
Odo to Ops.

332
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,192
Go ahead.

333
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,069
The snow's disappeared

334
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,990
but now there's a Gunji jackdaw
running loose around here.

335
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,701
Just try to keep things
under control, Odo.

336
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,119
We're working on it.

337
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,871
Understood.

338
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,334
Come along now.
Come along.

339
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,877
There we go.

340
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:48,549
(<i> yelling and laughing</i> )

341
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:00,436
Ladies and gentlemen

342
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,147
may I have your
attention, please?

343
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,026
Ladies and gentlemen

344
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,946
and all androgynous
creatures

345
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,322
your attention, please.

346
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,991
As you may
have noticed

347
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:15,409
we're experiencing
some difficulties.

348
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,704
I'm going to have
to ask you all

349
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,121
to please refrain

350
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,915
from using your
imaginations.

351
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:23,167
QUARK:
Just because you
don't have an imagination

352
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:28,339
don't ruin it
for the rest of us.

353
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,591
Let me guess.

354
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:34,971
Another clever Federation
experiment has gone awry

355
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:38,140
and you've turned
the whole station

356
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,184
into one vast holosuite.

357
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,729
The phenomenon
is being investigated

358
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,146
as we speak.

359
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,773
Uh-huh.

360
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,776
Well, uh, tell them
to take their time.

361
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:52,030
I haven't had a chance
to show the ladies

362
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,324
my collection
of Tartaran landscapes yet.

363
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:58,661
I'm surprised
by your attitude, Quark.

364
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,538
Ah, yes.

365
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:04,208
Well, you simply don't have
the same appreciation for...

366
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,170
art as I do.

367
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,297
WOMAN:
Dabo.

368
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:13,051
(<i> cheering</i> )

369
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:17,221
I'm surprised because every one
of your customers is winning.

370
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,681
What?

371
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,725
They're taking you
to the poorhouse.

372
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,518
WOMAN:
Dabo. Another winner!

373
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,604
No.
No, that's not possible.

374
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,606
Let me through.

375
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:30,192
Lose. Lose...

376
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,779
One cross...

377
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,280
Two cross.

378
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,741
(<i> cheering</i> )

379
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:39,619
No! No!

380
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,537
You're outnumbered, Quark.

381
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,248
Pardon me.
Pardon me.

382
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,837
(<i> whimpers</i> )

383
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,766
I was afraid of this.

384
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:05,185
The proximity of the wormhole
is amplifying the rupture.

385
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,354
The proton counts
are going through the roof.

386
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,107
Dax to O'Brien.

387
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,733
How are you coming
with that probe, Chief?

388
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,401
I'll have
the subspace scanners programmed

389
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,736
in less than an hour.

390
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,114
Keep me informed.
Dax out.

391
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:19,450
I have the wave
intensity analysis.

392
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,160
Computer, scan
all data files

393
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,121
for comparable wave
intensity patterns.

394
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:24,371
COMPUTER:
Stand by.

395
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,461
Jadzia...

396
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:32,588
I find this
difficult to say

397
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,174
but I want you
to know, I would...

398
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,260
Julian, there's really
no need to apologize.

399
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,846
In a way

400
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,889
I feel as if we've
invaded<i> your</i> privacy.

401
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,810
We all have fantasies and dreams
we keep to ourselves--

402
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,147
thoughts
that should remain private.

403
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:50,815
I'm glad you understand.

404
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,525
Of course I do.

405
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,277
I was a young man... once.

406
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,489
So we can put
all this behind us?

407
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,158
Of course.

408
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:01,617
Good.

409
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,828
The computer seems
to be having trouble

410
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,204
finding a match.

411
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,581
She really is submissive,
isn't she?

412
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,625
Is that how you want
me to be, Julian?

413
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,169
So submissive?

414
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:13,212
I am not submissive.

415
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,547
Am I?

416
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,340
Uh, no.

417
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,135
Um, uh...
well, I don't think so.

418
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:22,429
I'm just not the cold fish
you are.

419
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,558
Cold fish?

420
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,561
Now, I, uh, never said that.

421
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,188
DAX 2:
If you'd get down

422
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:31,731
off your high horse

423
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,233
you'd start to
appreciate Julian.

424
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,152
She has a sense of humor

425
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,154
as I've always
imagined you do.

426
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,364
I could use one about now.

427
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,116
Come on,
Lieutenant.

428
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,035
Stop denying all those
yearnings you feel.

429
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:46,204
Yearnings?

430
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:47,663
If you don't

431
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,790
you'll never know
what you missed.

432
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,291
COMPUTER:
Pattern match found.

433
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,211
Just in the nick of time.

434
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,131
A similar subspace rupture
was reported

435
00:20:57,131 --> 00:21:00,009
in the Hanoli system
in the mid-23rd century.

436
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,510
The Hanoli system.

437
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,887
I don't believe
I know where that is.

438
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,764
There's no reason you should.

439
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:08,768
When the rupture expanded,
the system was destroyed.

440
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:23,199
SISKO:
<i>Station Log, Stardate 46853.2.</i>

Calibrating sensors

Three minutes to coordinates.

447
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,094
Wave patterns should begin

448
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:45,512
fluctuating any time now.

449
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,307
There.

450
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,517
The probe is penetrating
the thoron field.

451
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:53,395
Two and a half minutes
to coordinates.

452
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,816
Ah, for simpler times, eh?

453
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,358
Go away.

454
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,319
I only want to help.

00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,612
(<i> beeping</i> )

456
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:04,698
You're in the way.

457
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:10,329
A farmer from Derry
once tried to chase me off

458
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:14,625
until I saved his crops...
from locusts.

459
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,170
Two minutes to coordinates.

460
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,630
Thoron emissions are stable.

461
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,925
You know what I find
most intriguing

462
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:25,136
about you, my good host?

463
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,720
You're afraid.

464
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,434
Of me.

465
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,187
Look, figment

466
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:37,940
I'm not afraid of anybody,
least of all you.

467
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,442
90 seconds to coordinates.

468
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,902
Figment, am I?

469
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:45,323
A figment of my
imagination, that's all.

470
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:46,532
And yet

471
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,450
you can't deny

472
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,744
how this imagination of yours
empowers me, can you?

473
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,247
Empowers me in a way

474
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,124
that somehow terrifies you.

475
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:58,544
You should be getting
some primary data, Commander.

476
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,088
SISKO:
They're coming in now, Chief.

477
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,548
Stand by.

478
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:06,260
She is your firstborn,
isn't she?

479
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,765
(<i> sighs</i> )

480
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:15,602
30 seconds to coordinates.

481
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:18,356
Thoron emission

Ten seconds.

00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:25,988
DAX:
The probe's approaching
the perimeter of the anomaly.

485
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,323
That's strange.

486
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:28,741
What is it?

487
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,202
Negative readings
on all sensors.

488
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:35,081
We may be looking
at some sort of folded space.

489
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,999
Let's see what
the optical scanner

490
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,292
on the probe gives us.

491
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:47,218
It's drawing in all the matter
from the surrounding space.

492
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:49,511
Benjamin, it's getting larger.

493
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,185
Feel like taking
a few ground balls?

494
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:57,895
Look, I tried to tell you

495
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:00,022
you're on a space station
in the 24th century.

496
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:03,525
The only ball field around
is a holographic simulation.

497
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,443
It's not real,
and neither are you.

498
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,487
Oh, you see,
I don't get it.

499
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,656
I can pinch myself
and it hurts

500
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,491
and I am here with you,
aren't I?

501
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,577
Right now you are, but,
in a minute, who knows?

502
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,038
I hope when we get this thing
figured out, you'll...

503
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,664
Disappear for good?

504
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,749
I hope so.

505
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:20,293
Oh, you do, huh?

506
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:22,336
Well, so let's just say
for a moment I don't.

507
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:23,754
So what am I supposed
to do, huh?

508
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,172
You got room on your team

509
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,258
for a switch-hitting
third baseman

510
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:28,634
with good power?

511
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,052
Good power from
the left side.

512
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:33,097
Left side?
Ben, hey.

513
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:34,432
Hey, Ben.

514
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:35,891
What are you talking about?

515
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,684
I hit over 20 homers
right-handed

516
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,728
in each of my first three years
in the majors.

517
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,730
And never more
than ten after that.

518
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,442
That was because Old Crow
moved me to second in the order.

519
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:46,568
I wish I had
more time for this.

520
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:51,157
Well, that was baseball's
epitaph, wasn't it?

521
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,993
Nobody seemed to have
time for us anymore.

522
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,245
You know, I could have
played five more years

523
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,247
if they hadn't
killed the game.

524
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,498
You were the best
that ever played.

525
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:01,625
I know.

526
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,210
I've played with them all.

527
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,464
I've got work to do.

528
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:08,757
Hey, Ben.

529
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,801
It really meant a lot to me--

530
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,261
how much you cared.

531
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,512
That day we won the World Series

532
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:17,141
there were only 300 people
in the stands.

533
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:19,601
301 in my version.

534
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,021
I heard you cheering.

535
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,023
Meant a lot to me.

536
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:28,735
I just thought
you should know, you know

537
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:32,072
in case I do finally disappear.

538
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:38,536
Ops.

539
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:46,586
We don't know any more
than when we started.

540
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:50,299
Why would mine create a
woman and then reject her?

541
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:54,011
Why would mine create a dwarf
that could terrify him?

542
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:56,472
We should abandon
the whole thing.

00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:57,806
BOKAI:
Not yet.

544
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,309
I made a connection with mine.

545
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:01,601
A curious one.

546
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,103
I sense a feeling from him--

547
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,646
an affection for this ballplayer

548
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,233
who died 200 years
before he was even born.

549
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,734
And how much longer

550
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,319
do you suggest
we devote to this?

551
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,863
As long as it takes.

552
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:16,867
It ain't over till it's over.

555
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:30,214

00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:34,009

<i>away from the station.</i>

560
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,016
O'BRIEN:
A Vulcan science mission
to the Hanoli rift

561
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,893
detonated a pulse
wave torpedo

562
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,978
at the coordinates
of the tear.

563
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:48,232
Five minutes after they did,
the rupture expanded radically.

564
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:49,733
They were wiped out

565
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,444
along with the entire
Hanoli system.

566
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:53,820
What happened
to the rupture after that?

567
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,531
It's not still there?

568
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,657
It reached a critical mass point
and imploded

569
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:00,702
and then disappeared
from normal space altogether.

570
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,413
Were there any reports
from the Vulcans

571
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:03,997
about hallucinations on board?

572
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,459
Anything similar
to what we're experiencing?

573
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,710
No, sir, but they were
only within range

574
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,463
of the anomaly for 12 hours.

575
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:12,965
And Vulcans don't have
the most active imaginations.

576
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,925
Were there
any explanations offered

577
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:17,052
for the initial cause
of the rupture?

578
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,554
Dozens, nothing confirmed.

579
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,180
But we do know
there were no wormholes

580
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,057
and very little starship
activity

581
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,850
in the area before it formed.

582
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,936
We've looked high and low
for some common ground--

583
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:28,981
something to give us a fix
on how to attack this thing

584
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,567
and frankly, sir,
as funny as it sounds

585
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:34,528
we think pulse wave torpedoes
may still be the best approach.

586
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,238
Wait a minute.

587
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,031
If it didn't work
very well last time, why...

588
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,033
The Vulcans were using
a primitive device.

589
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,035
In the past 200 years

590
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,955
we've developed far better ways
of controlling the flux density.

591
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:48,041
We should be able to contain
the internal reaction this time.

592
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,128
And if we can't, we destroy
the whole Bajoran system.

593
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:53,088
Major, the rupture
is already expanding.

594
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,672
We have to seal it

595
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:57,050
or it's going to destroy
this system anyway.

596
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,886
The smaller it is,
the better chance we have.

597
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,180
How long will it take
to create

598
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,640
one of these torpedoes?

599
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,058
We could have one
ready by 2200 hours.

600
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,769
If the rift expands at all
before imploding

601
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,146
we have to be prepared.

602
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,064
Route auxiliary power
to shields.

603
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,650
Major, I'd like for you

604
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,110
to coordinate evacuation
of the pylons.

605
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,069

609
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:28,666
I need you to do a security
sweep through the pylons.

610
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:29,833
We're going to evacuate them.

You don't understand.

All pylons are secured.

722
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,051
Everyone's been moved
to the Habitat Ring

723
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:55,761
for the time being.

724
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,095
You're worried.

725
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,137
You bet I am.

726
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,765
If this doesn't work

727
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:02,642
nothing real or imagined
is going to survive.

728
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,228
Hold me.

729
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,481
Please.

730
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:12,151
Torpedoes ready.

731
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,029
Status of shields?

732
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,823
All available power's
been transferred.

733
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:20,118
Reading shield strength
at 158% above normal.

734
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,954
Let's hope it's enough.

735
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:23,162
Red Alert.

736
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,664
Fire!

737
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:32,089
All systems functioning
properly.

738
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:34,967
Torpedo guidance
is on nominal track.

739
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:37,176
30 seconds to coordinates.

740
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:40,013
Impulse sustainer
throttling down.

741
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:42,140
Arming pulse wave
initiator.

742
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,559
Torpedo hull temperature
dropping.

743
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,185
Activating
pulse waves.

744
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:49,188
Compression level at 1,400
and rising.

745
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,857
20 seconds.

746
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:53,276
Compression at 2,900.

747
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,861
3,000.

748
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,072
Terminal targeting spread
confirmed.

749
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,865
3,500.

750
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,199
Holding compression.

751
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,284
Ten seconds.

752
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,744
Ready to detonate.

753
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:03,996
Ready, sir.

754
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:05,330
Five seconds.

755
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,539
Now.

756
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:14,131
Wave intensity
from the rift is dropping.

757
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:17,216
The thoron field boundary
is shrinking.

758
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,136
Particle energy is rising.

759
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:20,720
(<i> console beeping</i> )

760
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,180
Wait a minute.
What's this?

761
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,222
Wave emissions are fluctuating.

762
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,390
We're not getting

763
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,433
a controlled collapse.

764
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,559
Chief?

765
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,978
Damn it,
we're picking up

766
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:29,521
an exothermic
reaction pattern.

767
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,648
It may be neutralizing
the pulse waves.

768
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:33,483
Stand by.

769
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:35,652
Perimeter sensors are picking up
a subspace oscillation.

770
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,195
What the hell does that mean?

771
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,197
Proton counts have tripled.

772
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,700
Residual pulse wave activity
from our torpedoes

773
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,326
is down to 14%.

774
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,745
The flux density readings
inside the rupture

775
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,747
are off the scale.

776
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:02,345
Odo to Ops!

777
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,597
Ops! Ops!

778
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,229
Com circuits are down.

779
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:14,107
I'll try to reroute pathways.

780
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:15,692
Life support is normal.

781
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:16,860
Shields.

782
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,236
O'BRIEN:
A generator's down.

783
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,863
Section Four is exposed.

784
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:21,322
Odo to Ops.

785
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,615
There we go.

786
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,450
Constable, check for casualties.

787
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,286
Have your deputies move
everybody out of Section Four.

788
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,371
We have shield damage.

789
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,873
Acknowledged.

790
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,166
What are we getting
from the rift?

791
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,751
Sensors aren't operating.

792
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,377
O'BRIEN:
Stand by, sir.

793
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,882
I can't feel my hands.

794
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,592
Lie still, lie still.

795
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:43,344
There's an emergency
medical kit

796
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,138
in the cabinet there.

797
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:46,264
Get it.

798
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,350
I'm sorry...

799
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,019
Shh.

800
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:53,146
Here you go.

801
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:55,899
I never meant to bother you.

802
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:57,609
No, no.

803
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:00,153
You didn't bother me.

804
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:03,406
I can't keep my eyes open.

805
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,324
Don't close your eyes.

806
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:06,743
I want you awake.

807
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:09,246
You have a nasty
concussion.

808
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,792
I can't help it.

809
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,210
Dax.

810
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,377
Dax!

811
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,754
Sensors are back on line.

812
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,172
KIRA:
The rupture is continuing

813
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:21,216
to widen... 340 times larger

814
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:22,717
than before.

815
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,594
Is it showing
any signs of collapsing?

816
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:27,055
Wave emissions from the rift
are still fluctuating.

817
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,599
I can't make any sense
out of these readings.

818
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,768
Proton counts are lower
than before.

819
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:33,770
And now
they're beginning to rise again.

820
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,855
The pulse waves
from our torpedoes

821
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,149
have been completely
neutralized.

822
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:38,733
It's just
a matter of time

823
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,152
before the rift
starts expanding again.

824
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:41,236
How much time?

825
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:42,361
Minutes.

826
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,696
Suggestions.

827
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:51,704
Run out of ideas, friend?

828
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,456
I have a suggestion.

829
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,125
Maybe I can help.

830
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,375
You?

831
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,086
You created me with powers

832
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:00,880
beyond those of mortal men

833
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,425
and I would be more than happy
to use them to assist you.

834
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,219
For a price.

835
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,977
I've always wanted a daughter.

836
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,520
Miles?

837
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,896
KIRA:
Perimeter sensors
are picking up

838
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,564
subspace oscillations again.

839
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,066
O'BRIEN:
You're telling me
you can seal

840
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,609
that rupture out there?

841
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,945
I can spin straw into gold,
my friend.

842
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,072
This seems
no more difficult.

843
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,824
Well, do it, damn it!

844
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:29,951
Will you meet my price?

845
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:32,578
This is crazy.

846
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:36,958
You're out of a storybook,
a fairy tale.

847
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,751
RUMPELSTILTSKIN:
Are you willing
to give her up

848
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,586
to save so many others?

849
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,214
SISKO:
No.

850
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:43,673
He doesn't have to.

851
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:46,384
Dax, when did our sensors

852
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,386
first pick up traces
of the rupture?

853
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,971
You were there,
Benjamin.

854
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,223
When we were first
trying to figure

855
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:52,515
this whole thing out.

856
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,808
And if I remember correctly

857
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,352
you said
that your previous scans

858
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:57,478
hadn't picked up
any anomalies at all.

859
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,314
I thought whatever was out there

860
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:02,192
was too small for the scanners
to identify.

861
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:04,944
So you imagined
that we had a subspace rupture

862
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,697
and that's exactly
what it turned out to be.

863
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:10,242
That<i> is</i> what I imagined.

864
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:12,327
And once you'd learned
about the rift

865
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:14,329
that destroyed
the Hanoli system

866
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:17,665
we all imagined that we might
have another just like it.

867
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,625
Mr. O'Brien, drop the shields.

868
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:20,793
Sir?

869
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,628
There is no rupture.

870
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:26,507
There is no threat
to this station, or this system.

871
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,261
End Red Alert
and drop the shields.

872
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:31,679
Aye, sir.

873
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,932
And believe it,
Mr. O'Brien.

874
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,434
It's important
that you believe it.

875
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,395
Aye, sir.

876
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:41,273
Are your sensors picking up
any magnetic shock waves, Major?

877
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:42,690
Yes, sir.

878
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,734
Perimeter readings still show...

879
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,778
No shock waves
at all.

880
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:50,407
None at all.

881
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,579
Lieutenant, proton counts.

882
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,831
Normal.

883
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,212
It's gone.

884
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:08,466
You're going
to be fine.

885
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,551
Of course I am.

886
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:13,805
I have the best doctor
in the galaxy.

887
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,981
None of this makes any sense.

888
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:26,818
I mean, why did they appear
in the first place?

889
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,653
It might still be related

890
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,447
to the elevated thoron emissions
in the plasma field.

891
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:32,490
The readings still
haven't returned to normal.

892
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,451
Continue your analysis, Dax

893
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:35,701
but this time

894
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,329
no speculations

895
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:38,704
just facts.

896
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:40,539
Yes, Benjamin.

897
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:43,293
Major, keep us on Yellow Alert
for the next 26 hours

898
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:44,710
till we see

899
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,838
that everything
is back to normal.

900
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:49,715
Chief, take your family home.

901
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,092
That's an order.

902
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,844
Aye, sir.

903
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:15,450
(<i> sighs</i> )

904
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,338
BOKAI:
This imagination
of yours--

905
00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:29,839
it's a tough concept

906
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,050
for us to get a handle on, Ben.

907
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:35,053
You're not simply a figment
of my imagination, are you?

908
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:38,473
We're on an extended mission
exploring the galaxy.

909
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,766
A while back,
we followed one of your ships

910
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,477
through that hole in space
out there.

911
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:44,103
We've been watching you.

912
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,064
Trying to figure out
the rules of your game.

913
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:49,192
Why didn't you just
talk to us like this?

914
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:50,902
Well, we've learned
that you can never tell

915
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:53,196
how someone will treat
the visiting team.

916
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:55,073
I understand.

917
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:57,742
That's what this has been
all about--

918
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:59,244
learning to understand.

919
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:01,120
Was it really necessary

920
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,082
to put the whole station
in jeopardy?

921
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:07,252
But we didn't, Ben.

922
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:09,045
It was<i> you.</i>

923
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:12,215
It was your imaginations
that created everything.

924
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:15,385
We were just watching
to see where it took you.

925
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:17,887
Oh, this imagination
of yours.

926
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,765
We have never seen
anything like it.

927
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:23,017
It's very real
to all of you

928
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,602
but yet it's not.

929
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,272
At first, it seemed to us
to be a curse

930
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:28,940
an irritation.

931
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,443
That Odo fellow
even called it a waste of time.

932
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:33,278
I disagree with him.

933
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:34,653
I knew you would.

934
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,448
I learned that about you.

935
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:38,616
That you could have
such an affection

936
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,992
for someone
you never even met.

937
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,954
I wonder if you appreciate

938
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:47,125
how unique that imagination
of yours really is.

939
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:51,296
Not always.

940
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:53,923
We got to go.

941
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:55,216
But you haven't
told us anything

942
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,009
about<i> your</i> species.

943
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,387
I'd like to.

944
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:01,347
Maybe next year.
