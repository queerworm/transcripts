1
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,592
KIRA:
Now, remember.

2
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:11,386
I want him treated
like a visiting head of state.

3
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,722
Full communications
and computer access

4
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:17,267
any assistance he may need
from the station's crew.

5
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:18,936
You should have told us
he was coming sooner.

6
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:20,354
I think we have
a red carpet

7
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,730
in storage somewhere.

8
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,900
Dax, this is important.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,027
Tekeny Ghemor led
the dissident movement

10
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,904
against Cardassia's
Central Command

11
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:31,281
and now that Dukat
and the Dominion have taken over

12
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,284
there is<i> no one</i> better qualified
to lead the opposition.

13
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,328
Besides, he's practically
your father.

14
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,746
Your father?

15
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:40,708
Ghemor<i> is</i>
<i>a Cardassian.</i>

16
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:41,750
(<i> sighs</i> )

17
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,377
It's a long story.

18
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:44,920
DAX:
The Cardassians
once kidnapped Kira.

19
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,254
And surgically
altered her to look

20
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:47,673
like Ghemor's
missing daughter.

21
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,132
KIRA:
It was part of a plan

22
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,467
to expose him
as the leader

23
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,051
of the dissident movement.

24
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,846
Cardassian politics
are very complex.

25
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:56,306
I think they
like it that way.

26
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,851
Ghemor may be the only hope
left for Cardassia.

27
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:00,227
He deserves our help.

28
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:04,064
That's a lot of faith
to put in one man.

29
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,233
I hope I won't prove

30
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,277
too great a
disappointment.

31
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,320
Legate Ghemor.

32
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,031
It's good to see you.

33
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:14,700
How many times must
I tell you, Nerys...

34
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,869
if you won't
call me father,

35
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:19,246
Tekeny will do.

36
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,875
Welcome to Deep Space 9,
Tekeny.

37
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:29,590
Um, this is
our Science Officer--

38
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,551
Lieutenant Commander
Jadzia Dax

39
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,636
and our
Strategic Operations Officer

40
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,137
Lieutenant Commander Worf.

41
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:44,772
That's quite a reception
for an old man.

42
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:49,651
Ah... I see
you're wearing the bracelet

43
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,070
I gave you.

44
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,238
Uh, not<i> exactly</i> permitted

45
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,241
under the uniform code, but...

46
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,785
It looks good on you.

47
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:02,372
Well, it was a pleasure
meeting both of you

48
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,291
but if you don't mind

49
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,168
I'm afraid the journey here
was a little... draining.

50
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,880
Oh, I'll show you
to your quarters.

51
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,972
Major Kira-- friends
with a Cardassian.

52
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:20,015
It seems wrong.

53
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,017
You should
have known her

54
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,351
five years ago.

55
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,812
Back then, I
never thought

56
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,605
she'd be friends
with anyone.

57
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,702
I've had the replicator
programmed

58
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,412
with a<i> complete</i> Cardassian menu.

59
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:46,500
You've got 26-hour-a-day
computer access.

60
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,210
A private subspace com channel

61
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,006
and if there is anything
else that you need

62
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:53,172
you just ask me.

63
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:55,174
I wish I had your energy.

64
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,513
I am sorry.

65
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,180
I, uh...

66
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,058
I just wanted you
to feel at home.

67
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,935
You've been very kind.

68
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,354
I thought you should know.

69
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,857
I checked with Bajoran Security.

70
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,275
There's still no leads
on your daughter.

71
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,945
She's dead, isn't she?

72
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,822
We don't know that.

73
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:20,492
Now, if Iliana is still alive,
she's been undercover

74
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,119
on Bajor for over
a decade now.

75
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,704
It's very hard
to find

76
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,580
someone
who's been hiding that long.

77
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,416
I know you're trying
to keep my hopes up

78
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,752
but it's time I face the facts.

79
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,212
I'm alone.

80
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:36,175
You are the closest thing
to family

81
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:38,052
that I have left.

82
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:41,013
Bajoran Security
has not given up hope.

83
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:42,347
Neither should you.

84
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,058
You just...

85
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:46,060
you just have
to be patient.

86
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,687
I'm afraid<i> patience</i>
<i>is for the young.</i>

87
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,983
But what about you, Nerys?

88
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,818
How is life treating you?

89
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:57,320
Oh, I've got
no complaints.

90
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,240
Now, did you read the
proposal I sent you?

91
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,243
It was very ambitious

92
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,038
but I'm afraid
you'll have to find

93
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:08,790
another person
to lead the effort.

94
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,002
No. You are the<i> perfect</i>
<i>person for the job.</i>

95
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,962
You're still popular
on Cardassia.

96
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,172
The people
respect you.

97
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,715
They'll listen
to you.

98
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,178
It's not that simple.

99
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,931
We can make it work.

100
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,100
We'll set up a
government in exile

101
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,601
here on the station.

102
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,061
You could make
regular transmissions

103
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,562
into Cardassia.

104
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,814
Issue corrections
to their propaganda.

105
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,525
Mobilize your old friends
in the dissident movement.

106
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,484
Nerys...

107
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,028
it's a good plan

108
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,239
but I can't help you.

109
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,907
Why?

110
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:48,122
I have Yarim Fel syndrome.

111
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:50,791
It's terminal, Nerys.

112
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,585
I'm dying.

113
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,873
I'm afraid the prognosis
isn't good.

114
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,376
The disease has already spread
throughout your digestive tract

115
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:59,460
your circulatory
and respiratory systems

116
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,588
and your cartilaginous
tissue.

117
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,464
How much time
do I have left?

118
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,217
I'm not sure.

119
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:07,719
There are still
some treatments we can try--

120
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,179
hexadrin therapy

121
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,847
or neuroregeneration
procedures.

122
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,474
I appreciate
anything you can do.

123
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,520
I'm sorry, Nerys.

124
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,357
I'm afraid this isn't going
the way you planned.

125
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,109
Oh, don't
worry about me.

126
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,069
The important thing
is to get you well.

127
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,122
Begin Captain's Log.

128
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,373
Stardate--

129
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,540
O'BRIEN:
Ops to Sisko.

130
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,251
Go ahead.

131
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:41,086
We've got an incoming message
from Cardassia.

132
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,421
It's from Gul Dukat.

133
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:45,048
He's demanding to speak to you.

134
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,216
Put him through.

135
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,141
Ah, Captain Sisko,
always a pleasure.

136
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,435
Still calling yourself<i> Gul?</i>

137
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,812
I'm surprised
you haven't promoted yourself

138
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,063
back to Legate by now.

139
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:03,150
I prefer the title "Gul."

140
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:07,112
So much more hands-on
than Legate. Hmm?

141
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:10,115
And less pretentious
than the other alternatives--

142
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:15,120
President, Emperor,
First Minister... Emissary.

143
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,247
How about Dominion Puppet?

144
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:20,541
(<i> laughs</i> )

145
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:24,212
Captain, such comments
only reveal

146
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,048
a deep misunderstanding
of the intricacies

147
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,967
of the Dominion
political system.

148
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:32,846
Under our new administration,
Cardassia enjoys

149
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,140
unparalleled autonomy, and--

150
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,851
You can justify yourself
later, Dukat.

151
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,144
I'm a busy man.

152
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,938
Very well.

153
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,815
We have reason to believe

154
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,818
you have one of our citizens
aboard your station--

155
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,611
a certain Tekeny Ghemor

156
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:52,407
formerly a Legate in the
Cardassian Central Command.

157
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:53,783
And if we do?

158
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:57,704
Well, we want him back.

159
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:01,958
To put it mildly...
he has a lot to answer for.

160
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,045
I will take your request
under advisement.

161
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,547
But considering the Federation

162
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,549
doesn't recognize
your government

163
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,551
and that Cardassia
has never agreed

164
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,846
to an extradition treaty
with Bajor<i> or</i> the Federation

165
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,098
you shouldn't get your hopes up.

166
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,989
What a beautiful baby you are.

167
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,033
Yes.

168
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,910
You must be
very proud.

169
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,537
He's Miles and Keiko's baby.

170
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:40,663
I just carried him
to term for them.

171
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,123
(<i> groans</i> )

172
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,126
Maybe you'd better...

173
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,294
Yeah.

174
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,093
Are you...?

175
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,761
It'll pass.

176
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,142
It's silly...

177
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:04,687
but I almost feel
like a grandfather.

178
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:09,025
After all, you're the closest
thing I have to a daughter.

179
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,863
Yoshi's the closest thing
I have to a son.

180
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,699
You'd make
a terrific grandfather.

181
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,622
And what about you, Nerys?

182
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,250
Have you ever thought
about having one of your own?

183
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:29,254
Maybe... with that Shakaar

184
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,256
fellow of yours.

185
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,758
You know about me and Shakaar?

186
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:38,263
I've...
I've been keeping an eye on you.

187
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,643
It made me feel
like I still had family.

188
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,605
What did you do, hire someone
to follow me around?

189
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:49,816
Credit an old man
with some restraint.

190
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,318
I just had people tell me

191
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,403
when they heard anything
about you.

192
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:59,075
Like it or not,
you're a public figure, Nerys.

193
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,869
First Officer on one
of the most important

194
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,872
military installations
in the Quadrant.

195
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,791
Your feud with Kai Winn

196
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,919
has become already
something of a legend.

197
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,380
Did you know that you have
your own section

198
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,715
in the Cardassian
Central Archives?

199
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,598
You've made an impression
on people, Nerys.

200
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,142
A good one.

201
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,519
You should be proud

202
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,937
of everything
you've accomplished.

203
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,106
I am.

204
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:38,990
You know, I've kept my ears open
for news about you, too.

205
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,741
I was worried about you.

206
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:44,329
Opposing the Cardassian
government...

207
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,664
it's dangerous business.

208
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:48,667
I enjoyed it while it lasted.

209
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,709
I have a
fondness

210
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,671
for hopeless causes.

211
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,341
It runs in the family.

212
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,099
Dukat called the station.

213
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,935
He wants you extradited
to Cardassia.

214
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,690
I'm not surprised.

215
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,652
He knows
that as long as I'm alive

216
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,820
I'm still a threat to him.

217
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,033
We won't let him get
his hands on you. Mm-mm.

218
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,453
Nerys...

219
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:40,759
Nerys, I know more
about the Cardassian government

220
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,430
than anyone alive--
names, alliances, plots.

221
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,306
Things that
could do

222
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,309
a lot of good
in the right hands.

223
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:52,313
There's a Cardassian tradition--
<i>shri-tal.</i>

224
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,692
The dying give their secrets
to their family

225
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,776
to use against their enemies

226
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:03,283
but I have no one left
to carry my secrets.

227
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,202
No one but you.

228
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,870
Me?

229
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:14,252
Be my daughter
one last time, Nerys.

230
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:20,383
Hear what I know,
and use it as you see fit.

231
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,388
I hate to
sound callous

232
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,181
but we have a tremendous
opportunity here.

233
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,643
Ghemor is basically
volunteering to give us

234
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,311
more intelligence
on Cardassia

235
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,938
than we've been able
to gather in five years.

236
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,065
That's exactly what he's doing.

237
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,233
It's quite a
responsibility

238
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,318
he's handing you.

239
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,486
(<i> sighs</i> )

240
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,656
I know.

241
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,618
I... I can't help wondering

242
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:50,079
if he's chosen
the right person.

243
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,873
What if I get
too involved or...

244
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,376
I don't ask
the right questions?

245
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:00,590
Maybe...

246
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,883
maybe I can convince Ghemor

247
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,303
to talk to a counselor,
or Constable Odo.

248
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,846
I mean, he questions
people every day.

249
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:08,973
Maybe.

250
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,849
But Ghemor
just doesn't

251
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,310
want to be
debriefed.

252
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,312
He wants someone
to talk to.

253
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,482
Someone to be with
until the end.

254
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:26,282
And that someone... is me.

255
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,702
(<i> distant voices clamoring</i> )

256
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,834
(<i> groaning</i> )

257
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,130
(<i> groaning loudly</i> )

258
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,759
Nerys!

259
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,266
Father.

260
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,439
(<i> man gasping</i> )

261
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,153
Father, can you hear me?

262
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:15,039
SISKO:
Are you up to it?

263
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,550
I have no choice.

264
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,554
I'm all he's got.

265
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,816
If Ghemor's pain
gets too severe

266
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,443
push this.

267
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,653
It'll administer a small
dose of triptacedrine.

268
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,655
If you want to replenish
the medication

269
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,907
be sure and turn this valve

270
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,366
disconnect it from here

271
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,992
and replace it
with a new supply.

272
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,912
If you don't want
to do it yourself

273
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:55,204
you can always call
for a nurse to help.

274
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,247
I can manage.

275
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,165
I hope you're right.

276
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,710
Looking after someone with
a terminal condition isn't easy.

277
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,962
Especially in this case,
where you'll be acting

278
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,005
as Ghemor's only source
of emotional support.

279
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,133
I-I know what I'm
getting myself into.

280
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,051
I'm sure you do.

281
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,305
Well, let me know
if you need anything.

282
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,363
(<i> sighs</i> )

283
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,580
(<i> whispering</i> ):
Tekeny...

284
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,419
Nerys...

285
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,256
No... d-don't try to move.

286
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,883
Mouth's dry.

287
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,469
I'll get you some water.

288
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,268
Oh, damn it.

289
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,478
Oh...

290
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,439
I'm sorry.

291
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,567
It's all right.

292
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,405
You're doing fine.

293
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,784
Maybe we should get started.

294
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,754
Session one...

295
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:30,090
Stardate 50712.5.

296
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,552
Whenever
you're ready.

297
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,930
Probably Dukat's
most powerful enemy

298
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,932
is Gul Trepar

299
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,184
the head of the Fourth Order.

300
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,268
He's...

301
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,269
(<i> gasps</i> )

302
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,188
What is it?

303
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,316
Button.

304
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,700
(<i> breathing again</i> )

305
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,117
Better?

306
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,912
You know, maybe
I can ask Dr. Bashir

307
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,496
to get you something
stronger.

308
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,040
No.

309
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,876
Anything stronger
and I'd be unconscious.

310
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:09,380
And you and I
have a lot to talk about.

311
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,131
Where were we?

312
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,058
(<i> sighs</i> )

313
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,642
Trepar.

314
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,686
Trepar.

315
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:28,399
Trepar used to outrank Dukat

316
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,151
and he's not happy
to be taking orders

317
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,905
from one of his
former subordinates.

318
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:39,201
Trepar's aide is a man
named Glinn Borven

319
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,956
a political opportunist
with all the loyalty...

320
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,040
Medic!

321
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,042
We need a medic!

322
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,419
What the hell's
taking them so long?

323
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,337
Nerys...

324
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,632
Nerys, don't leave me.

325
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:56,010
I was such a fool.

326
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,386
When the Cardassians

327
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,680
started setting fire
to the village

328
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,265
I tried to talk to them

329
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,683
to reason with them.

330
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,852
Look what they've done to me.

331
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:08,689
I'm going to make them
pay for this, I promise you.

332
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,484
They burned my garden...

333
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,694
set fire to everything.

334
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,321
I worked for years

335
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,157
planning and caring for it.

336
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,076
Now it's gone.

337
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,036
We'll plant another one.

338
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,537
Together, you and I.

339
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,790
I wish I had your strength,
Nerys

340
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,500
your confidence.

341
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,210
I'm so afraid.

342
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,213
Where's that damn medic?

343
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,008
Don't go. Stay with me.

344
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,968
The medic can wait.

345
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:39,470
I don't want to be alone.

346
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:05,830
(<i> sighs</i> )

347
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,624
The subject is asleep.

348
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,502
I'm concluding the
interview for the day.

349
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:14,172
(<i> groaning softly</i> )

350
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,634
Cold... cold...

351
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,314
It's a good start.

352
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,734
Starfleet Intelligence
will be very pleased.

353
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,070
And there's more
where that came from.

354
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,072
Ghemor seems to know
every politician

355
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,074
and bureaucrat
on Cardassia.

356
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,368
You look tired.

357
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,453
I've been up
for 30 hours straight.

358
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,081
You should get some rest.

359
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,165
Bashir to Major Kira.

360
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,875
Go ahead.

361
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,128
Please report to Ghemor's
quarters immediately.

362
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:09,143
He's not responding
to the hexadrin therapy anymore.

363
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,310
Nerys...

364
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,314
I'm here.

365
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,613
Ask me questions, Nerys.

366
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,573
We don't have much time.

367
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,537
You were talking about
the Supreme Tribunal.

368
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,470
Status report.

369
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,889
A Jem'Hadar battleship
is approaching the station.

370
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,474
Its weapons are armed

371
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:49,892
and its targeting systems
are active.

372
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,560
Red Alert.

373
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,020
All crew members report
to battle stations.

374
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,147
They're hailing us.

375
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,356
On screen.

376
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,068
Captain Sisko.

377
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,694
SISKO:
Gul Dukat

378
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,029
what's the meaning of this?

379
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,073
You said you'd take my request

380
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:07,076
for Ghemor's extradition
under advisement.

381
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,619
They've locked weapons
on the station.

382
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:12,248
I eagerly await your decision.

383
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,015
Captain Sisko.

384
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:31,433
Thank you
for the kind invitation.

385
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:36,230
This is one of my
Dominion advisors--

386
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,732
Weyoun.

387
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,484
We've met.

388
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:44,030
I saw you die.

389
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,405
That wasn't me.

390
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,116
At least, not exactly.

391
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:50,828
The Vorta are experts
at cloning.

392
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,830
It tends to mitigate
the risk involved

393
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,414
in so much of our work.

394
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,542
My predecessor was
the fourth incarnation

395
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:57,918
of our noble progenitor.

396
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:58,961
I'm the fifth.

397
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,378
Immortality.

398
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:01,339
Of a sort.

399
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:03,007
Interested?

400
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:05,218
Dukat, you said
you wanted to talk to me.

401
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:07,220
Now is your chance.

402
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,263
Then, I'll make it simple,
Captain.

403
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:11,182
Tekeny Ghemor is not a well man.

404
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:14,227
He would be better off under
the care of his own people.

405
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:15,269
We want him to know

406
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:16,520
he can come home.

407
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,314
To attend his own execution.

408
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,233
No, not at all.

409
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:23,443
Ghemor's case has been reviewed
by the new judicial system

410
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:26,197
and he's been cleared
of any wrongdoing.

411
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:29,033
Dominion courts
are renowned for their honesty

412
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,201
and equanimity.

413
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:31,451
DUKAT:
So, as you can see

414
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,995
there's no reason why Ghemor

415
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,580
can't return to Cardassia.

416
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,999
I don't think
he would agree with you.

417
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:39,085
Perhaps, we should find out.

418
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,795
GHEMOR:
Dukat, I have a week
to live-- maybe less.

419
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,505
Do you really
expect me

420
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,174
to trade my silence
for a few short days

421
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:47,176
under
the Cardassian sun?

422
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:49,387
It is where you
belong, Ghemor.

423
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:51,347
And it's where I'd be
at this very moment

424
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:53,473
if you hadn't betrayed
our people to the Dominion.

425
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,770
Good day, Dukat.

426
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,564
He doesn't seem
to like you very much.

427
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,233
We're going to have
to do something

428
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:03,192
about your public image.

429
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:04,860
Gentlemen...

430
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,987
DUKAT:
You haven't heard
my entire offer.

431
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,865
We do have something else
I think might interest you.

432
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:10,908
Your daughter.

433
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:12,785
Iliana?

434
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:16,205
Iliana... I... I...

435
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,291
Don't listen to him.

436
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,457
DUKAT:
Your daughter

437
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:20,709
is alive, Ghemor.

438
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,378
I know where to find her.

439
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:28,092
I want to believe you, Dukat,
but...

440
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,927
even if I did

441
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:34,181
let's just say, I don't like
the company you're keeping.

442
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:37,184
You and I might have
come to an agreement

443
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,186
one Cardassian
to another

444
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,147
but now,
dealing with you

445
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,357
means dealing with them

446
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:45,985
and that makes the price
too high.

447
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,404
All right, you have your answer.

448
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:51,449
My ship will be docked
here a few days longer...

449
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:53,700
In case you
change your mind.

450
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,119
I won't.

451
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:27,318
(<i> speaking indistinctly</i> )

452
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:48,172
(<i> moaning</i> )

453
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:03,979
What can I get
for you, Major?

454
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:07,107
A frosty Bajoran
ale, perhaps?

455
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,692
Or something stronger?

456
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,152
How about a Black Hole?

457
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:12,779
(<i> sighs</i> )

458
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,656
Whatever.

459
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,992
You look terrible.

460
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,452
Not that I mind.

461
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,162
I like my women
a little rumpled.

462
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,747
Quark, just get me my drink.

463
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:26,001
I know just the thing--
warm Enyak's milk.

464
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,212
It'll help you sleep.

465
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:37,179
(<i> door chimes</i> )

466
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:38,347
Come in.

467
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,272
Major.

468
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:48,524
Sorry to
disturb you.

469
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:50,276
Sorry enough to leave?

470
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:55,114
Your defense of Ghemor
is admirable.

471
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,990
But did it ever occur to you

472
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,743
that you may be fighting
the wrong battle?

473
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:03,080
Do you recall
the massacre

474
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,373
at the Kiessa Monastery?

475
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:06,917
Kiessa.

476
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,336
What's that got to do
with Ghemor?

477
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,092
See for yourself.

478
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:18,011
That is his official
military record.

479
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:22,099
You can verify anything on there
with Bajoran Intelligence

480
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:23,392
if you like.

481
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:30,399
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
You are really enjoying this

482
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,942
aren't you?

483
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,737
Hmm?

484
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,656
All your sick little games.

485
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:42,744
(<i> chuckling</i> )

486
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:49,709
I must admit, I do get a
certain... perverse pleasure

487
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,003
out of it.

488
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,754
Read it or not

489
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,298
it's up to you.

490
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,395
I promise you, Dukat

491
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:11,857
I will make you pay
for all of this one day.

492
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,984
Maybe...

493
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:16,111
but not today.

494
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:34,087
(<i> sighing</i> )

495
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,858
(<i> straining grunt</i> )

496
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,319
Nerys!

497
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,029
KIRA:
I'll be right there.

498
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,449
<i>Now</i> what?

499
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,368
I... I was thirsty.

500
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:06,579
Just sit back.

501
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,581
You're all tangled up.

502
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,332
I'm... I'm sorry.

503
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,292
Well, it's a little late
for that now, isn't it?

504
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,753
Nerys, is
something wrong?

505
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:15,837
Yes, there's
something wrong.

506
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:16,880
You lied to me.

507
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,923
About what?

508
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,466
About everything.

509
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,301
But let's start
with Kiessa Monastery.

510
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,595
Kiessa.

511
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:24,096
You were there,
weren't you?

512
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,972
Dukat told you.

513
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:29,727
The Cardassian army
burned Kiessa to the ground.

514
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:31,061
17 monks were killed.

515
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,312
But they were
hiding weapons

516
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,022
for the resistance.

517
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,775
Weapons that were being
used to kill my friends.

518
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,194
It, it was...
it was<i> war.</i>

519
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,238
It was easy to despise you.

520
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:44,157
But you... you weren't
the monsters.

521
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,867
<i>We</i> were.

522
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,788
I wish I'd never
joined the military.

523
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,915
Never have volunteered
for duty on Bajor.

524
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,375
But I did.

525
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:54,834
And I can't change that

526
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,170
no matter how much
I might want to.

527
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,590
So instead you hid
the truth from me.

528
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,258
No... Nerys...

529
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:03,385
I didn't want you
to hate me.

530
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:04,886
It's what you deserve.

531
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,472
Nerys!

532
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,231
Dabo!

533
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,650
(<i> laughing</i> )

534
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,025
That<i> is</i> dabo,
isn't it?

535
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,444
Uh-huh.

536
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,862
I don't know why
you insist on playing

537
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,615
this ridiculous game.

538
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,325
I like games.

539
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,328
Ah, Captain!

540
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,788
Can I help you?

541
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:32,539
I thought we should talk.

542
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:35,917
I realize I haven't been
much of a host.

543
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,383
Here.

544
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,843
Have some<i> kanar.</i>

545
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,595
Ah! No, thank you.

546
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,054
I'm not...

547
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,223
particularly thirsty
right now.

548
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,309
I insist.

549
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:58,440
I said, no thank you.

550
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,611
I never touch<i> kanar</i>
<i>on an empty stomach, Captain.</i>

551
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,822
It's bad for the digestion.

552
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:08,450
In this case, that's something
of an understatement.

553
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:11,911
Because in that bottle,
there's enough voraxna poison

554
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:14,289
to kill at least
a dozen Cardassians.

555
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,874
It was delivered

556
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,084
to Tekeny Ghemor
less than 20 minutes ago.

557
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,294
Fascinating.

558
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,046
What's wrong,
Dukat?

559
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,131
Are you afraid Ghemor's
going to say something

560
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,884
that might undermine
your new cozy position?

561
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,972
Tread with care, Captain.

562
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:34,601
You're coming dangerously close
to accusing the head

563
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,979
of the Cardassian government
of attempted murder.

564
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,273
Is that what I'm doing?

565
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,110
(<i> chuckling</i> )

566
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,822
How delightful.

567
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:49,949
The mysterious plots,
the subtle innuendo

568
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,827
the veiled threats.

569
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:53,704
It's all so
entertaining.

570
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:55,622
(<i> chuckling</i> )

571
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:56,832
Wha...?

572
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,211
Oh, my...

573
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:04,047
that is quite toxic, isn't it?

574
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,258
Are you insane?

575
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,510
Vorta are immune
to most forms of poison.

576
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,345
Comes in handy
when you're a diplomat.

577
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,222
(<i> laughs</i> )

578
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:15,434
Especially when you're working
with the Cardassians.

579
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,018
You can keep

580
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,687
the<i> kanar,</i> Dukat.

581
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:21,106
Ghemor won't be drinking it.

582
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:46,882
It's a little late
for services, Major.

583
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:49,968
I needed a quiet
place to think.

584
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:54,389
You got something to say
to me, Constable, say it.

585
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:58,811
I understand you've stopped
visiting Ghemor.

586
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:00,061
He lied to me.

587
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,605
I thought
he was different

588
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,315
but he's just like
the rest of them.

589
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,358
Is he? Really?

590
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:09,362
I've seen his file,
too, Major.

591
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:12,031
He was 19 when Kiessa
was destroyed.

592
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,117
He'd been
in the military

593
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,911
for less than a year

594
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:18,580
and was only one of 400 soldiers
at the Monastery.

595
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,667
There's no way of knowing
if he even fired a shot.

596
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,042
Well, he shouldn't have
been there at all.

597
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,127
This isn't about

598
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,337
Ghemor's war record.

599
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,130
If it really mattered

600
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,132
you wouldn't have waited
for Dukat to hand it to you.

601
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,217
You would have looked it up
yourself.

602
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,719
What are you trying to say?

603
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,554
That I should go back
down there?

604
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,973
Ah...

605
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:40,560
No, I wasn't saying that at all.

606
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,312
Are<i> you?</i>

607
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,442
(<i> yelling in pain</i> )

608
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,735
Father.

609
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,111
Father.

610
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,571
Father...
hold still.

611
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,114
You'll tear
your bandages.

612
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,783
My garden. They
burned my garden.

613
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,368
I know. I know.

614
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:59,705
I can hear the Prophets
calling me, Nerys.

615
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:03,041
I can feel my<i> pagh</i>
<i>slipping away.</i>

616
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,877
FUREL:
Nerys!

617
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:06,503
We found them.

618
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:09,047
It's a Cardassian
heavy weapons unit.

619
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,258
Third assault group.
Ninth Order.

620
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,426
Hold on.

621
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,054
I'll be right back.

622
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,180
How far?

623
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,182
Just outside of Tempasa.

624
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,475
I'll go with you.

625
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,770
Are you sure?

626
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,146
I know the area.

627
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,523
So does Gantt.

628
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:28,191
They didn't shoot
Gantt's father.

629
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,359
They shot mine.

630
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,571
All right. Go!

631
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:38,076
We found the soldiers
that did this to you.

632
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,870
I'm going
to make them pay

633
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,162
just like I promised.

634
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,831
The others... let them.

635
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,583
You don't have to go.

636
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,209
Yes, I do.

637
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,460
Yes, I do.

638
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,379
I won't be long.

639
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,382
Let's go!

640
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:08,231
(<i> door chimes</i> )

641
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,233
Come in.

642
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:16,489
Um, I thought you should know
that, uh...

643
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:19,158
Ghemor's condition
has deteriorated.

644
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,661
He'll be dead within the hour.

645
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:33,465
Thank you for the information,
Doctor.

646
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,258
Is that it?

647
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:40,305
"Thank you for the information"?

648
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,307
Ghemor is dying.

649
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:43,558
I heard you.

650
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,185
Major,
he wants to see you.

651
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:48,855
Well, I don't want to see him.

652
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,899
Major, please.

653
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,901
It's almost over.

654
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,654
There's no more questions to ask

655
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,781
no more work to be done.

656
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:59,825
Just go to his quarters

657
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,242
and sit with him.

658
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,202
I said no.

659
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,038
Don't ask me again.

660
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,792
Fine.

661
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:12,504
You must do what you want...

662
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,631
but I think
you're making a mistake.

663
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:17,258
Regardless of what Ghemor's
done in the past

664
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,594
he doesn't deserve to die alone.

665
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,307
Nobody does.

666
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,482
(<i> people laughing</i> )

667
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:36,611
All four mortar rounds
right in the central compound.

668
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,237
And the way they ran--

669
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,073
it was like kicking over
a mound of barrowbugs.

670
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:41,116
What was the count?

671
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:42,742
Five skimmers

672
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:45,120
and at least, at least
15 Cardassian dead.

673
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,580
Now, that's not
a bad day's work.

674
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,290
We should celebrate, huh?

675
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,250
Yeah, they kill us,
we kill them.

676
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,670
It's nothing
worth celebrating.

677
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,838
(<i> sighs</i> )

678
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:56,339
Nerys.

679
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,383
Your father.

680
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:13,439
He died
calling your name.

681
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,905
Get another raiding party
together.

682
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:22,991
I want to hit
those Cardassians again

683
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:25,493
as soon as we have a chance.

684
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:51,269
Would you, uh, like me
to call everyone together?

685
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,355
Have Prylar Quen
say a few words.

686
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,442
There's nothing left to say.

687
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:25,595
I didn't think you would come.

688
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:28,598
Well, for a while
there, neither did I.

689
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,788
Cause of death
was CNS failure

690
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:54,207
brought on
by Yarim Fel syndrome.

691
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:55,834
One witness was present--

692
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,628
a Major Kira Nerys
of the Bajoran Militia.

693
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:01,422
Witness's statement is attached.

694
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:08,471
Major, we're done here.

695
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,808
That's it?

696
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:13,101
A quick post-mortem

697
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,894
a statement
from the witness

698
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,438
and... a little paperwork?

699
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:21,901
Seems so straightforward.

700
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,403
It never is.

701
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:28,491
He got so quiet...

702
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:31,286
toward the end.

703
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:34,831
I-I could hear him
whispering things--

704
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:38,668
his wife's name,
Iliana's, even mine.

705
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:43,381
Then the pain
just got too much for him

706
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,883
and he just lay there...

707
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:48,053
breathing...

708
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:52,473
And at the end
of every exhale...

709
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:55,434
there was this pause,
and I thought, "That's it.

710
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,729
It's over."

711
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:03,276
Then he'd force
another breath...

712
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:05,237
and another.

713
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,784
I started counting them.

714
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:14,329
One hundred...

715
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,622
two hundred...

716
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,042
three hun...

717
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:25,590
He fought for every last second.

718
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:31,137
I don't think he even knew
that I was there.

719
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,514
He knew.

720
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,641
You gave him what he needed.

721
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,643
He didn't die alone.

722
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:43,149
Maybe he gave me
something I needed.

723
00:40:47,404 --> 00:40:50,323
I missed my father's death
by less than an hour.

724
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:52,533
Did you know that?

725
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,535
Less than an hour.

726
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:59,916
I always told myself
that it was...

727
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:03,586
bad luck, bad timing...

728
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:06,631
the will of the Prophets.

729
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:12,637
But the truth is...

730
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:16,641
I didn't have to go when I did.

731
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:19,311
I could have stayed
a while longer.

732
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:22,814
I saw my chance
to get out

733
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,066
and I took it.

734
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:26,734
(<i> sighing</i> )

735
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:30,571
I saw so much death
during the occupation.

736
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:33,491
I felt so much pain that...

737
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,870
But my father...

738
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,296
he was my strength

739
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:51,801
and I, I couldn't stand to see
that strength slipping away.

740
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,597
So, I ran.

741
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:59,934
Just like you tried to run
from Ghemor.

742
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:04,522
He reminded me so much
of my father.

743
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,317
Going through it again, I-I...

744
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:09,652
I just couldn't face it.

745
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,654
But in the end, you did.

746
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:14,199
You were there for Ghemor.

747
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,617
I owed it to him.

748
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,786
I owed it to my father...

749
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:23,582
to get it right this time.

750
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:31,007
(ragged inhale and exhale<i> )</i>

751
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,554
You wanted to see me?

752
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,847
Yes.

753
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:40,641
I understand
Legate Ghemor

754
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:41,976
has passed away.

755
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:44,603
You must be very relieved.

756
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,523
Oh, Captain

757
00:42:46,523 --> 00:42:49,150
such cynicism
does not suit you.

758
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,735
All of Cardassia

759
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:53,654
will mourn the passing
of Tekeny Ghemor.

760
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,156
He was a great man.

761
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:57,409
I'm surprised
to hear you say that.

762
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:58,993
Not at all.

763
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,620
It takes a great man
to admit he's wrong

764
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,581
and that's what Ghemor did.

765
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:07,085
I'm speaking of
his last-minute
change of heart.

766
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,795
His deathbed
decision

767
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:13,007
to embrace
the new Dominion government.

768
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:17,678
That's very moving,
except for one small problem.

769
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,722
It never happened.

770
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,268
As you say,
it's... a small problem.

771
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:24,727
I would like

772
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:27,439
his body transferred to my ship.

773
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:32,277
We'll take him home and bury him
with full state honors.

774
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:37,532
Well, I'm afraid
that's going to be impossible.

775
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:40,743
Legate Ghemor's
funeral arrangements

776
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:43,455
have already been taken care of.

777
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:47,333
