1
00:00:07,076 --> 00:00:08,671
Now, remember.

2
00:00:08,714 --> 00:00:11,654
I want him treated
like a visiting head of state.

3
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:13,923
Full communications
and computer access

4
00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:17,494
any assistance he may need
from the station's crew.

5
00:00:17,537 --> 00:00:19,201
You should have told us
he was coming sooner.

6
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:21,839
I think we have a red carpet
in storage somewhere.

7
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:25,213
Dax, this is important.

8
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:27,386
Tekeny Ghemor led
the dissident movement

9
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,094
against Cardassia's
Central Command

10
00:00:29,134 --> 00:00:31,538
and now that Dukat
and the Dominion have taken over

11
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:34,570
there is no one better qualified
to lead the opposition.

12
00:00:34,614 --> 00:00:36,551
Besides, he's practically
your father.

13
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:38,146
Your father?

14
00:00:38,191 --> 00:00:41,359
Ghemor is a Cardassian.

15
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:43,438
It's a long story.

16
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:45,271
The Cardassians
once kidnapped Kira.

17
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:46,608
And surgically altered her
to look

18
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:47,876
like Ghemor's missing daughter.

19
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:49,078
It was part of a plan

20
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:51,614
to expose him as the leader
of the dissident movement.

21
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:54,154
Cardassian politics
are very complex.

22
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:56,671
I think they like it that way.

23
00:00:56,706 --> 00:00:59,235
Ghemor may be the only hope
left for Cardassia.

24
00:00:59,279 --> 00:01:00,441
He deserves our help.

25
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,356
That's a lot of faith
to put in one man.

26
00:01:04,392 --> 00:01:09,497
I hope I won't prove
too great a disappointment.

27
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:10,508
Legate Ghemor.

28
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:12,274
It's good to see you.

29
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,978
How many times must
I tell you, Nerys...

30
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,082
if you won't call me father,

31
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:19,529
Tekeny will do.

32
00:01:19,565 --> 00:01:23,006
Welcome to Deep Space 9,
Tekeny.

33
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:29,882
Um, this is
our Science Officer...

34
00:01:29,925 --> 00:01:32,831
Lieutenant Commander
Jadzia Dax

35
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:34,860
and our
Strategic Operations Officer

36
00:01:34,905 --> 00:01:36,431
Lieutenant Commander Worf.

37
00:01:41,053 --> 00:01:45,258
That's quite a reception
for an old man.

38
00:01:45,298 --> 00:01:50,107
Ah... I see
you're wearing the bracelet

39
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:51,340
I gave you.

40
00:01:51,381 --> 00:01:56,588
Uh, not exactly permitted
under the uniform code, but...

41
00:01:56,627 --> 00:01:57,994
It looks good on you.

42
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:02,941
Well, it was a pleasure
meeting both of you

43
00:02:02,977 --> 00:02:04,503
but if you don't mind

44
00:02:04,548 --> 00:02:07,579
I'm afraid the journey here
was a little... draining.

45
00:02:07,623 --> 00:02:10,027
Oh, I'll show you
to your quarters.

46
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,172
Major Kira... friends
with a Cardassian.

47
00:02:18,217 --> 00:02:20,381
It seems wrong.

48
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:23,554
You should have known her
five years ago.

49
00:02:23,597 --> 00:02:26,833
Back then, I never thought
she'd be friends with anyone.

50
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:40,942
I've had the replicator
programmed

51
00:02:40,976 --> 00:02:42,776
with a complete Cardassian menu.

52
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:46,813
You've got 26-hour-a-day
computer access.

53
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:49,626
A private subspace com channel

54
00:02:49,665 --> 00:02:52,229
and if there is anything
else that you need

55
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,468
you just ask me.

56
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:55,513
I wish I had your energy.

57
00:02:57,686 --> 00:02:59,121
I am sorry.

58
00:02:59,624 --> 00:03:01,595
I, uh...

59
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:03,429
I just wanted you
to feel at home.

60
00:03:03,468 --> 00:03:05,132
You've been very kind.

61
00:03:05,172 --> 00:03:07,644
I thought you should know.

62
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:10,345
I checked with Bajoran Security.

63
00:03:10,385 --> 00:03:12,584
There's still no leads
on your daughter.

64
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,324
She's dead, isn't she?

65
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:16,857
We don't know that.

66
00:03:16,903 --> 00:03:20,868
Now, if Iliana is still alive,
she's been undercover

67
00:03:20,913 --> 00:03:22,611
on Bajor for over a decade now.

68
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:23,881
It's very hard to find

69
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:25,983
someone
who's been hiding that long.

70
00:03:26,026 --> 00:03:28,760
I know you're trying
to keep my hopes up

71
00:03:28,801 --> 00:03:31,000
but it's time I face the facts.

72
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:33,444
I'm alone.

73
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,510
You are the closest thing
to family

74
00:03:36,587 --> 00:03:38,524
that I have left.

75
00:03:38,592 --> 00:03:41,292
Bajoran Security
has not given up hope.

76
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,734
Neither should you.

77
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,536
You just...

78
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:46,545
you just have to be patient.

79
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,984
I'm afraid patience
is for the young.

80
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:53,219
But what about you, Nerys?

81
00:03:53,264 --> 00:03:55,235
How is life treating you?

82
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:57,798
Oh, I've got no complaints.

83
00:03:57,842 --> 00:04:00,610
Now, did you read
the proposal I sent you?

84
00:04:01,953 --> 00:04:03,685
It was very ambitious

85
00:04:03,724 --> 00:04:06,424
but I'm afraid
you'll have to find

86
00:04:06,465 --> 00:04:09,131
another person
to lead the effort.

87
00:04:09,171 --> 00:04:12,373
No. You are the perfect
person for the job.

88
00:04:12,413 --> 00:04:14,213
You're still popular
on Cardassia.

89
00:04:14,251 --> 00:04:15,481
The people respect you.

90
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:16,751
They'll listen to you.

91
00:04:19,264 --> 00:04:21,566
It's not that simple.

92
00:04:21,604 --> 00:04:24,304
We can make it work.

93
00:04:24,344 --> 00:04:26,406
We'll set up
a government in exile

94
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,817
here on the station.

95
00:04:27,853 --> 00:04:29,345
You could make
regular transmissions

96
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,757
into Cardassia.

97
00:04:30,795 --> 00:04:33,165
Issue corrections
to their propaganda.

98
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,866
Mobilize your old friends
in the dissident movement.

99
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:36,877
Nerys...

100
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,505
it's a good plan

101
00:04:38,548 --> 00:04:40,610
but I can't help you.

102
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,189
Why?

103
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:48,596
I have Yarim Fel syndrome.

104
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,169
It's terminal, Nerys.

105
00:04:51,214 --> 00:04:53,948
I'm dying.

106
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:54,929
I'm afraid the prognosis
isn't good.

107
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:57,498
The disease has already spread
throughout your digestive tract

108
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,513
your circulatory
and respiratory systems

109
00:06:59,547 --> 00:07:01,541
and your cartilaginous
tissue.

110
00:07:01,586 --> 00:07:03,523
How much time do I have left?

111
00:07:03,558 --> 00:07:05,050
I'm not sure.

112
00:07:05,095 --> 00:07:07,624
There are still
some treatments we can try...

113
00:07:07,702 --> 00:07:08,898
hexadrin therapy

114
00:07:08,938 --> 00:07:10,772
or neuroregeneration
procedures.

115
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,510
I appreciate
anything you can do.

116
00:07:16,158 --> 00:07:17,457
I'm sorry, Nerys.

117
00:07:17,494 --> 00:07:20,491
I'm afraid this isn't going
the way you planned.

118
00:07:20,536 --> 00:07:22,005
Oh, don't worry about me.

119
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:24,010
The important thing
is to get you well.

120
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,199
Begin Captain's Log.

121
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,300
Stardate...

122
00:07:36,343 --> 00:07:37,607
Ops to Sisko.

123
00:07:37,646 --> 00:07:39,115
Go ahead.

124
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,280
We've got an incoming message
from Cardassia.

125
00:07:41,323 --> 00:07:42,292
It's from Gul Dukat.

126
00:07:42,326 --> 00:07:45,094
He's demanding to speak to you.

127
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:46,159
Put him through.

128
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:54,253
Ah, Captain Sisko,
always a pleasure.

129
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,660
Still calling yourself Gul?

130
00:07:56,695 --> 00:07:58,859
I'm surprised
you haven't promoted yourself

131
00:07:58,902 --> 00:08:00,064
back to Legate by now.

132
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:03,307
I prefer the title "Gul."

133
00:08:03,346 --> 00:08:07,118
So much more hands-on
than Legate. Hmm?

134
00:08:07,156 --> 00:08:10,187
And less pretentious
than the other alternatives...

135
00:08:10,231 --> 00:08:15,438
President, Emperor,
First Minister... Emissary.

136
00:08:15,477 --> 00:08:17,539
How about Dominion Puppet?

137
00:08:20,859 --> 00:08:24,528
Captain, such comments
only reveal

138
00:08:24,568 --> 00:08:27,406
a deep misunderstanding
of the intricacies

139
00:08:27,443 --> 00:08:29,311
of the Dominion
political system.

140
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:33,085
Under our new administration,
Cardassia enjoys

141
00:08:33,124 --> 00:08:35,562
unparalleled autonomy, and...

142
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:38,092
You can justify yourself
later, Dukat.

143
00:08:38,137 --> 00:08:39,538
I'm a busy man.

144
00:08:39,574 --> 00:08:42,206
Very well.

145
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:44,115
We have reason to believe

146
00:08:44,152 --> 00:08:47,058
you have one of our citizens
aboard your station...

147
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,825
a certain Tekeny Ghemor

148
00:08:48,932 --> 00:08:52,772
formerly a Legate in the
Cardassian Central Command.

149
00:08:52,808 --> 00:08:54,038
And if we do?

150
00:08:54,078 --> 00:08:58,077
Well, we want him back.

151
00:08:58,122 --> 00:09:02,395
To put it mildly...
he has a lot to answer for.

152
00:09:02,434 --> 00:09:05,431
I will take your request
under advisement.

153
00:09:05,474 --> 00:09:07,912
But considering the Federation

154
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,815
doesn't recognize
your government

155
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,719
and that Cardassia
has never agreed

156
00:09:11,757 --> 00:09:15,095
to an extradition treaty
with Bajor or the Federation

157
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:17,263
you shouldn't get your hopes up.

158
00:09:30,072 --> 00:09:33,342
What a beautiful baby you are.

159
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,544
Yes.

160
00:09:35,585 --> 00:09:37,351
You must be very proud.

161
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,882
He's Miles and Keiko's baby.

162
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,989
I just carried him
to term for them.

163
00:09:43,974 --> 00:09:45,534
Maybe you'd better...

164
00:09:45,578 --> 00:09:46,672
Yeah.

165
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:53,593
Are you?

166
00:09:53,632 --> 00:09:55,067
It'll pass.

167
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,682
It's silly...

168
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,161
but I almost feel
like a grandfather.

169
00:10:05,196 --> 00:10:09,435
After all, you're the closest
thing I have to a daughter.

170
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:14,242
Yoshi's the closest thing
I have to a son.

171
00:10:14,286 --> 00:10:17,488
You'd make
a terrific grandfather.

172
00:10:19,734 --> 00:10:22,606
And what about you, Nerys?

173
00:10:22,642 --> 00:10:25,707
Have you ever thought
about having one of your own?

174
00:10:27,053 --> 00:10:31,760
Maybe... with that Shakaar
fellow of yours.

175
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,134
You know about me and Shakaar?

176
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:38,675
I've...
I've been keeping an eye on you.

177
00:10:40,755 --> 00:10:44,161
It made me feel
like I still had family.

178
00:10:44,197 --> 00:10:47,069
What did you do, hire someone
to follow me around?

179
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:50,238
Credit an old man
with some restraint.

180
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,875
I just had people tell me

181
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,888
when they heard anything
about you.

182
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,733
Like it or not,
you're a public figure, Nerys.

183
00:10:59,771 --> 00:11:02,243
First Officer on one
of the most important

184
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:05,218
military installations
in the Quadrant.

185
00:11:05,252 --> 00:11:07,189
Your feud with Kai Winn

186
00:11:07,224 --> 00:11:10,323
has become already
something of a legend.

187
00:11:10,365 --> 00:11:12,929
Did you know that you have
your own section

188
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,102
in the Cardassian
Central Archives?

189
00:11:19,656 --> 00:11:22,026
You've made an impression
on people, Nerys.

190
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:24,695
A good one.

191
00:11:24,736 --> 00:11:26,000
You should be proud

192
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:28,341
of everything
you've accomplished.

193
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:30,441
I am.

194
00:11:34,562 --> 00:11:39,371
You know, I've kept my ears open
for news about you, too.

195
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,241
I was worried about you.

196
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:44,879
Opposing the Cardassian
government...

197
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:45,890
it's dangerous business.

198
00:11:45,924 --> 00:11:49,160
I enjoyed it while it lasted.

199
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:53,141
I have a fondness
for hopeless causes.

200
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,746
It runs in the family.

201
00:12:03,202 --> 00:12:05,674
Dukat called the station.

202
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,306
He wants you extradited
to Cardassia.

203
00:12:10,086 --> 00:12:12,148
I'm not surprised.

204
00:12:12,226 --> 00:12:16,168
He knows
that as long as I'm alive

205
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:18,333
I'm still a threat to him.

206
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:22,408
We won't let him get
his hands on you. Mm-mm.

207
00:12:24,324 --> 00:12:25,954
Nerys...

208
00:12:38,226 --> 00:12:41,223
Nerys, I know more
about the Cardassian government

209
00:12:41,334 --> 00:12:44,068
than anyone alive...
names, alliances, plots.

210
00:12:44,109 --> 00:12:45,977
Things that could do

211
00:12:46,014 --> 00:12:48,988
a lot of good
in the right hands.

212
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:52,963
There's a Cardassian tradition...
<i>shri-tal.</i>

213
00:12:52,998 --> 00:12:56,234
The dying give their secrets
to their family

214
00:12:56,273 --> 00:12:58,369
to use against their enemies

215
00:12:58,412 --> 00:13:03,825
but I have no one left
to carry my secrets.

216
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:06,593
No one but you.

217
00:13:06,634 --> 00:13:08,298
Me?

218
00:13:11,145 --> 00:13:14,917
Be my daughter one last time,
Nerys.

219
00:13:14,955 --> 00:13:20,732
Hear what I know,
and use it as you see fit.

220
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:24,566
I hate to sound callous

221
00:13:24,674 --> 00:13:27,169
but we have a tremendous
opportunity here.

222
00:13:27,214 --> 00:13:29,550
Ghemor is basically
volunteering to give us

223
00:13:29,587 --> 00:13:31,217
more intelligence on Cardassia

224
00:13:31,258 --> 00:13:33,753
than we've been able
to gather in five years.

225
00:13:33,798 --> 00:13:35,928
That's exactly what he's doing.

226
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,272
It's quite a responsibility
he's handing you.

227
00:13:41,418 --> 00:13:42,478
I know.

228
00:13:44,927 --> 00:13:46,522
I... I can't help wondering

229
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:48,934
if he's chosen the right person.

230
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:52,736
What if I get too involved or...

231
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:55,083
I don't ask
the right questions?

232
00:13:57,693 --> 00:14:00,393
Maybe...

233
00:14:00,435 --> 00:14:02,599
maybe I can convince Ghemor

234
00:14:02,706 --> 00:14:05,201
to talk to a counselor,
or Constable Odo.

235
00:14:05,246 --> 00:14:07,616
I mean, he questions
people every day.

236
00:14:07,686 --> 00:14:08,780
Maybe.

237
00:14:08,823 --> 00:14:12,229
But Ghemor just doesn't
want to be debriefed.

238
00:14:12,264 --> 00:14:14,292
He wants someone to talk to.

239
00:14:14,337 --> 00:14:17,139
Someone to be with
until the end.

240
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:26,226
And that someone... is me.

241
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:44,609
Nerys!

242
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:52,027
Father.

243
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:03,887
Father, can you hear me?

244
00:15:12,755 --> 00:15:14,817
Are you up to it?

245
00:15:23,516 --> 00:15:25,453
I have no choice.

246
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,461
I'm all he's got.

247
00:15:39,993 --> 00:15:43,628
If Ghemor's pain gets too
severe, push this.

248
00:15:43,668 --> 00:15:46,038
It'll administer a small dose
of triptacedrine.

249
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:48,046
If you want to replenish
the medication

250
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,516
be sure and turn this valve

251
00:15:49,551 --> 00:15:50,713
disconnect it from here

252
00:15:50,754 --> 00:15:52,452
and replace it
with a new supply.

253
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:54,258
If you don't want
to do it yourself

254
00:15:54,296 --> 00:15:55,822
you can always call
for a nurse to help.

255
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,926
I can manage.

256
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,371
I hope you're right.

257
00:15:58,407 --> 00:16:01,107
Looking after someone with
a terminal condition isn't easy.

258
00:16:01,147 --> 00:16:03,311
Especially in this case,
where you'll be acting

259
00:16:03,353 --> 00:16:05,415
as Ghemor's only source
of emotional support.

260
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,486
I-I know
what I'm getting myself into.

261
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:09,502
I'm sure you do.

262
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:12,510
Well, let me know
if you need anything.

263
00:16:36,171 --> 00:16:37,971
Tekeny...

264
00:16:42,421 --> 00:16:43,856
Nerys...

265
00:16:44,927 --> 00:16:48,026
No... d-don't try to move.

266
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:49,733
Mouth's dry.

267
00:16:49,773 --> 00:16:52,177
I'll get you some water.

268
00:16:58,563 --> 00:17:00,032
Oh, damn it.

269
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:01,126
Oh...

270
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:04,099
I'm sorry.

271
00:17:05,715 --> 00:17:07,207
It's all right.

272
00:17:09,224 --> 00:17:12,096
You're doing fine.

273
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:15,402
Maybe we should get started.

274
00:17:25,232 --> 00:17:27,431
Session one...

275
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:30,935
Stardate 50712.5.

276
00:17:31,047 --> 00:17:33,349
Whenever you're ready.

277
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:38,800
Probably Dukat's most
powerful enemy is Gul Trepar

278
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:40,964
the head of the Fourth Order.

279
00:17:41,007 --> 00:17:41,998
He's...

280
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:44,980
What is it?

281
00:17:46,186 --> 00:17:48,089
Button.

282
00:17:56,747 --> 00:17:57,773
Better?

283
00:17:57,817 --> 00:17:59,754
You know, maybe
I can ask Dr. Bashir

284
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:01,384
to get you something
stronger.

285
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:02,555
No.

286
00:18:02,595 --> 00:18:05,797
Anything stronger
and I'd be unconscious.

287
00:18:05,838 --> 00:18:10,145
And you and I
have a lot to talk about.

288
00:18:10,183 --> 00:18:11,813
Where were we?

289
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,062
- Trepar.
- Trepar.

290
00:18:22,061 --> 00:18:23,223
- Trepar.
- Trepar.

291
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,971
Trepar used to outrank Dukat

292
00:18:29,013 --> 00:18:31,713
and he's not happy
to be taking orders

293
00:18:31,753 --> 00:18:34,317
from one of his
former subordinates.

294
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:39,739
Trepar's aide is a man
named Glinn Borven

295
00:18:39,774 --> 00:18:43,477
a political opportunist
with all the loyalty...

296
00:18:43,517 --> 00:18:44,577
Medic!

297
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,682
We need a medic!

298
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,889
What the hell's
taking them so long?

299
00:18:48,931 --> 00:18:50,902
Nerys...

300
00:18:50,937 --> 00:18:53,101
Nerys, don't leave me.

301
00:18:53,142 --> 00:18:56,480
I was such a fool.

302
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:57,782
When the Cardassians

303
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:00,156
started setting fire
to the village

304
00:19:00,193 --> 00:19:01,719
I tried to talk to them

305
00:19:01,764 --> 00:19:03,131
to reason with them.

306
00:19:03,168 --> 00:19:05,538
Look what they've done to me.

307
00:19:05,574 --> 00:19:09,038
I'm going to make them
pay for this, I promise you.

308
00:19:09,084 --> 00:19:11,922
They burned my garden...

309
00:19:11,957 --> 00:19:14,121
set fire to everything.

310
00:19:14,163 --> 00:19:18,732
I worked for years
planning and caring for it.

311
00:19:18,775 --> 00:19:20,643
Now it's gone.

312
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,514
We'll plant another one.

313
00:19:22,551 --> 00:19:24,077
Together, you and I.

314
00:19:24,123 --> 00:19:26,185
I wish I had your strength,
Nerys

315
00:19:26,228 --> 00:19:28,028
your confidence.

316
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,664
I'm so afraid.

317
00:19:32,176 --> 00:19:33,806
Where's that damn medic?

318
00:19:33,847 --> 00:19:35,579
Don't go.
Stay with me.

319
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:37,453
The medic can wait.

320
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,962
I don't want to be alone.

321
00:20:07,602 --> 00:20:09,162
The subject is asleep.

322
00:20:09,206 --> 00:20:12,044
I'm concluding the
interview for the day.

323
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:19,155
Cold... cold...

324
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:32,760
It's a good start.

325
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,329
Starfleet Intelligence
will be very pleased.

326
00:20:35,373 --> 00:20:37,572
And there's more
where that came from.

327
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:39,777
Ghemor seems to know
every politician

328
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:41,551
and bureaucrat on Cardassia.

329
00:20:43,528 --> 00:20:44,997
You look tired.

330
00:20:45,099 --> 00:20:47,093
I've been up
for 30 hours straight.

331
00:20:47,137 --> 00:20:48,663
You should get some rest.

332
00:20:48,709 --> 00:20:50,110
Bashir to Major Kira.

333
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:51,375
Go ahead.

334
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:54,617
Please report to Ghemor's
quarters immediately.

335
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:09,586
He's not responding
to the hexadrin therapy anymore.

336
00:21:09,629 --> 00:21:10,791
Nerys...

337
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,765
I'm here.

338
00:21:18,385 --> 00:21:21,223
Ask me questions, Nerys.

339
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,163
We don't have much time.

340
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:29,137
You were talking
about the Supreme Tribunal.

341
00:21:43,685 --> 00:21:44,949
Status report.

342
00:21:44,988 --> 00:21:47,985
A Jem'Hadar battleship
is approaching the station.

343
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,056
Its weapons are armed

344
00:21:49,098 --> 00:21:50,966
and its targeting systems
are active.

345
00:21:51,003 --> 00:21:51,972
Red Alert.

346
00:21:52,006 --> 00:21:53,601
All crew members report
to battle stations.

347
00:21:53,643 --> 00:21:54,873
They're hailing us.

348
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:56,851
On screen.

349
00:21:58,523 --> 00:21:59,719
Captain Sisko.

350
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:02,597
Gul Dukat,
what's the meaning of this?

351
00:22:02,634 --> 00:22:04,730
You said you'd take my request

352
00:22:04,772 --> 00:22:07,678
for Ghemor's extradition
under advisement.

353
00:22:07,714 --> 00:22:09,240
They've locked weapons
on the station.

354
00:22:09,284 --> 00:22:12,725
I eagerly await your decision.

355
00:22:27,899 --> 00:22:29,927
Captain Sisko.

356
00:22:29,972 --> 00:22:32,444
Thank you
for the kind invitation.

357
00:22:34,349 --> 00:22:37,151
This is one
of my Dominion advisors...

358
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:39,160
Weyoun.

359
00:22:40,198 --> 00:22:41,497
We've met.

360
00:22:43,206 --> 00:22:44,972
I saw you die.

361
00:22:45,011 --> 00:22:46,480
That wasn't me.

362
00:22:46,514 --> 00:22:48,178
At least, not exactly.

363
00:22:48,219 --> 00:22:51,888
The Vorta are experts
at cloning.

364
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:53,991
It tends to mitigate
the risk involved

365
00:22:54,034 --> 00:22:55,401
in so much of our work.

366
00:22:55,437 --> 00:22:57,567
My predecessor was
the fourth incarnation

367
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,943
of our noble progenitor.

368
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,949
I'm the fifth.

369
00:22:59,982 --> 00:23:01,383
Immortality.

370
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,389
Of a sort.

371
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,948
Interested?

372
00:23:03,993 --> 00:23:06,157
Dukat, you said
you wanted to talk to me.

373
00:23:06,232 --> 00:23:08,362
Now is your chance.

374
00:23:08,404 --> 00:23:10,307
Then, I'll make it simple,
Captain.

375
00:23:10,343 --> 00:23:12,109
Tekeny Ghemor is not a well man.

376
00:23:12,147 --> 00:23:15,280
He would be better off under
the care of his own people.

377
00:23:15,322 --> 00:23:17,418
We want him to know
he can come home.

378
00:23:17,461 --> 00:23:19,489
To attend his own execution.

379
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:20,934
No, not at all.

380
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:24,605
Ghemor's case has been reviewed
by the new judicial system

381
00:23:24,647 --> 00:23:27,313
and he's been cleared
of any wrongdoing.

382
00:23:27,353 --> 00:23:29,951
Dominion courts
are renowned for their honesty

383
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:31,053
and equanimity.

384
00:23:31,096 --> 00:23:34,002
So, as you can see,
there's no reason why Ghemor

385
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:35,702
can't return to Cardassia.

386
00:23:35,742 --> 00:23:37,976
I don't think
he would agree with you.

387
00:23:38,014 --> 00:23:39,580
Perhaps, we should find out.

388
00:23:39,713 --> 00:23:41,513
Dukat, I have a week to live...

389
00:23:41,551 --> 00:23:42,520
maybe less.

390
00:23:42,553 --> 00:23:43,749
Do you really expect me

391
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,886
to trade my silence
for a few short days

392
00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:47,797
under the Cardassian sun?

393
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:50,169
It is where you belong, Ghemor.

394
00:23:50,207 --> 00:23:51,802
And it's where I'd be
at this very moment

395
00:23:51,878 --> 00:23:53,940
if you hadn't betrayed
our people to the Dominion.

396
00:23:56,524 --> 00:23:58,962
Good day, Dukat.

397
00:23:58,997 --> 00:24:01,492
He doesn't seem
to like you very much.

398
00:24:01,537 --> 00:24:03,201
We're going to have
to do something

399
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,436
about your public image.

400
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:05,639
Gentlemen...

401
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,084
You haven't heard
my entire offer.

402
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,888
We do have something else
I think might interest you.

403
00:24:10,928 --> 00:24:11,897
Your daughter.

404
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,662
Iliana?

405
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:17,234
Lliana... I... I...

406
00:24:17,277 --> 00:24:19,271
Don't listen to him.

407
00:24:19,316 --> 00:24:21,584
Your daughter is alive, Ghemor.

408
00:24:21,622 --> 00:24:23,320
I know where to find her.

409
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:29,339
I want to believe you, Dukat,
but...

410
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:30,844
even if I did

411
00:24:30,913 --> 00:24:35,220
let's just say, I don't like
the company you're keeping.

412
00:24:35,258 --> 00:24:38,289
You and I might have
come to an agreement

413
00:24:38,332 --> 00:24:42,172
one Cardassian to another,
but now, dealing with you

414
00:24:42,209 --> 00:24:44,373
means dealing with them

415
00:24:44,414 --> 00:24:47,046
and that makes the price
too high.

416
00:24:47,088 --> 00:24:49,492
All right, you have your answer.

417
00:24:49,527 --> 00:24:52,467
My ship will be docked
here a few days longer...

418
00:24:52,502 --> 00:24:54,666
In case you change your mind.

419
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:56,041
I won't.

420
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:05,045
What can I get for you, Major?

421
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:08,155
A frosty Bajoran ale, perhaps?

422
00:26:08,198 --> 00:26:09,667
Or something stronger?

423
00:26:09,703 --> 00:26:11,195
How about a Black Hole?

424
00:26:14,581 --> 00:26:15,641
Whatever.

425
00:26:15,684 --> 00:26:18,282
You look terrible.

426
00:26:18,324 --> 00:26:19,293
Not that I mind.

427
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,230
I like my women
a little rumpled.

428
00:26:21,266 --> 00:26:22,792
Quark, just get me my drink.

429
00:26:22,836 --> 00:26:27,177
I know just the thing...
warm Enyak's milk.

430
00:26:27,214 --> 00:26:29,276
It'll help you sleep.

431
00:26:38,376 --> 00:26:39,402
Come in.

432
00:26:44,994 --> 00:26:47,398
Major.

433
00:26:47,434 --> 00:26:49,598
Sorry to disturb you.

434
00:26:49,639 --> 00:26:51,473
Sorry enough to leave?

435
00:26:51,511 --> 00:26:56,286
Your defense of Ghemor
is admirable.

436
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,089
But did it ever occur to you

437
00:26:58,195 --> 00:27:00,861
that you may be fighting
the wrong battle?

438
00:27:00,902 --> 00:27:05,403
Do you recall the massacre
at the Kiessa Monastery?

439
00:27:06,449 --> 00:27:08,181
Kiessa.

440
00:27:08,221 --> 00:27:10,385
What's that got to do
with Ghemor?

441
00:27:14,504 --> 00:27:16,236
See for yourself.

442
00:27:16,275 --> 00:27:19,077
That is his official
military record.

443
00:27:19,115 --> 00:27:23,252
You can verify anything on there
with Bajoran Intelligence

444
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:24,455
if you like.

445
00:27:28,139 --> 00:27:33,312
You are really enjoying this,
aren't you?

446
00:27:35,492 --> 00:27:37,122
Hmm?

447
00:27:37,196 --> 00:27:39,964
All your sick little games.

448
00:27:44,348 --> 00:27:51,060
I must admit, I do get a
certain... perverse pleasure

449
00:27:51,098 --> 00:27:52,499
out of it.

450
00:27:52,536 --> 00:27:54,166
Read it or not

451
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:55,710
it's up to you.

452
00:28:07,341 --> 00:28:09,779
I promise you, Dukat

453
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:13,255
I will make you pay
for all of this one day.

454
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,454
Maybe...

455
00:28:15,495 --> 00:28:17,523
but not today.

456
00:28:57,073 --> 00:28:58,565
Nerys!

457
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,205
I'll be right there.

458
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:03,588
Now what?

459
00:29:03,623 --> 00:29:05,423
I... I was thirsty.

460
00:29:05,528 --> 00:29:07,692
Just sit back.

461
00:29:07,734 --> 00:29:09,898
You're all tangled up.

462
00:29:09,939 --> 00:29:11,569
I'm... I'm sorry.

463
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:13,444
Well, it's a little late
for that now, isn't it?

464
00:29:14,451 --> 00:29:15,943
Nerys, is something wrong?

465
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:17,116
Yes, there's something wrong.

466
00:29:17,158 --> 00:29:18,127
You lied to me.

467
00:29:18,161 --> 00:29:19,130
About what?

468
00:29:19,163 --> 00:29:20,291
About everything.

469
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:22,463
But let's start
with Kiessa Monastery.

470
00:29:22,506 --> 00:29:23,566
Kiessa.

471
00:29:23,608 --> 00:29:25,306
You were there, weren't you?

472
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,249
Dukat told you.

473
00:29:27,284 --> 00:29:30,817
The Cardassian army
burned Kiessa to the ground.

474
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,295
17 monks were killed.

475
00:29:32,331 --> 00:29:34,826
But they were hiding weapons
for the resistance.

476
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,969
Weapons that were being
used to kill my friends.

477
00:29:38,012 --> 00:29:40,450
It, it was...
it was war.

478
00:29:40,485 --> 00:29:42,513
It was easy to despise you.

479
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:45,427
But you... you weren't
the monsters.

480
00:29:45,465 --> 00:29:46,957
We were.

481
00:29:48,506 --> 00:29:51,104
I wish I'd never
joined the military.

482
00:29:51,146 --> 00:29:53,242
Never have volunteered
for duty on Bajor.

483
00:29:53,286 --> 00:29:54,550
But I did.

484
00:29:54,656 --> 00:29:56,148
And I can't change that

485
00:29:56,192 --> 00:29:58,460
no matter how much
I might want to.

486
00:29:58,499 --> 00:30:00,801
So instead you hid
the truth from me.

487
00:30:00,838 --> 00:30:02,570
No... Nerys...

488
00:30:02,677 --> 00:30:04,580
I didn't want you to hate me.

489
00:30:04,682 --> 00:30:06,151
It's what you deserve.

490
00:30:06,185 --> 00:30:07,677
Nerys!

491
00:30:16,278 --> 00:30:17,508
Dabo!

492
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:20,352
That is dabo, isn't it?

493
00:30:20,389 --> 00:30:21,358
Uh-huh.

494
00:30:21,392 --> 00:30:24,024
I don't know why
you insist on playing

495
00:30:24,065 --> 00:30:25,865
this ridiculous game.

496
00:30:25,903 --> 00:30:27,601
I like games.

497
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,647
Ah, Captain!

498
00:30:30,682 --> 00:30:32,015
Can I help you?

499
00:30:32,053 --> 00:30:33,853
I thought we should talk.

500
00:30:33,891 --> 00:30:37,297
I realize I haven't been
much of a host.

501
00:30:43,214 --> 00:30:44,683
Here.

502
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:46,086
Have some <i>kanar.</i>

503
00:30:46,122 --> 00:30:47,922
Ah! No, thank you.

504
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,429
I'm not...

505
00:30:49,464 --> 00:30:51,594
particularly thirsty
right now.

506
00:30:51,637 --> 00:30:53,631
I insist.

507
00:30:56,483 --> 00:30:59,719
I said, no thank you.

508
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:03,858
I never touch <i>kanar</i>
on an empty stomach, Captain.

509
00:31:03,901 --> 00:31:06,305
It's bad for the digestion.

510
00:31:06,341 --> 00:31:09,805
In this case, that's something
of an understatement.

511
00:31:09,851 --> 00:31:13,257
Because in that bottle,
there's enough voraxna poison

512
00:31:13,292 --> 00:31:15,594
to kill at least
a dozen Cardassians.

513
00:31:15,632 --> 00:31:17,124
It was delivered

514
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,472
to Tekeny Ghemor
less than 20 minutes ago.

515
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:20,671
Fascinating.

516
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,976
What's wrong, Dukat?

517
00:31:22,015 --> 00:31:24,544
Are you afraid Ghemor's
going to say something

518
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:27,084
that might undermine
your new cozy position?

519
00:31:29,234 --> 00:31:32,470
Tread with care, Captain.

520
00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:35,973
You're coming dangerously close
to accusing the head

521
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:39,289
of the Cardassian government
of attempted murder.

522
00:31:39,327 --> 00:31:41,629
Is that what I'm doing?

523
00:31:45,543 --> 00:31:48,175
How delightful.

524
00:31:48,216 --> 00:31:51,213
The mysterious plots,
the subtle innuendo

525
00:31:51,258 --> 00:31:53,229
the veiled threats.

526
00:31:53,263 --> 00:31:55,029
It's all so entertaining.

527
00:31:56,973 --> 00:31:58,101
Wha?

528
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,583
Oh, my...

529
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:05,287
that is quite toxic, isn't it?

530
00:32:05,328 --> 00:32:07,630
Are you insane?

531
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:09,901
Vorta are immune
to most forms of poison.

532
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,104
Comes in handy
when you're a diplomat.

533
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:16,754
Especially when you're working
with the Cardassians.

534
00:32:16,791 --> 00:32:20,027
You can keep
the <i>kanar,</i> Dukat.

535
00:32:20,066 --> 00:32:22,300
Ghemor won't be drinking it.

536
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:47,530
It's a little late
for services, Major.

537
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:50,568
I needed a quiet place to think.

538
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:55,190
You got something to say
to me, Constable, say it.

539
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:59,497
I understand you've stopped
visiting Ghemor.

540
00:32:59,535 --> 00:33:00,629
He lied to me.

541
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,902
I thought he was different

542
00:33:01,942 --> 00:33:04,004
but he's just like
the rest of them.

543
00:33:04,047 --> 00:33:06,041
Is he? Really?

544
00:33:07,121 --> 00:33:10,095
I've seen his file, too, Major.

545
00:33:10,129 --> 00:33:12,727
He was 19 when Kiessa
was destroyed.

546
00:33:12,769 --> 00:33:16,438
He'd been in the military
for less than a year

547
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:19,351
and was only one of 400 soldiers
at the Monastery.

548
00:33:19,387 --> 00:33:22,418
There's no way of knowing
if he even fired a shot.

549
00:33:22,462 --> 00:33:23,988
Well, he shouldn't have
been there at all.

550
00:33:24,032 --> 00:33:26,231
This isn't about
Ghemor's war record.

551
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:27,637
If it really mattered

552
00:33:27,675 --> 00:33:30,011
you wouldn't have waited
for Dukat to hand it to you.

553
00:33:30,048 --> 00:33:32,019
You would have looked it up
yourself.

554
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:33,420
What are you trying to say?

555
00:33:33,456 --> 00:33:35,256
That I should go back
down there?

556
00:33:35,328 --> 00:33:36,592
Ah...

557
00:33:38,136 --> 00:33:41,269
No, I wasn't saying that at all.

558
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,008
Are you?

559
00:33:48,228 --> 00:33:50,860
Father.
Father.

560
00:33:50,902 --> 00:33:52,303
Father... hold still.

561
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:54,036
You'll tear your bandages.

562
00:33:54,077 --> 00:33:55,707
My garden.
They burned my garden.

563
00:33:55,748 --> 00:33:56,910
I know. I know.

564
00:33:56,951 --> 00:34:00,484
I can hear the Prophets
calling me, Nerys.

565
00:34:00,527 --> 00:34:03,899
I can feel my <i>pagh</i>
slipping away.

566
00:34:03,936 --> 00:34:05,531
Nerys!

567
00:34:05,574 --> 00:34:07,272
We found them.

568
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,680
It's a Cardassian
heavy weapons unit.

569
00:34:09,717 --> 00:34:13,021
Third assault group.
Ninth Order.

570
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,188
Hold on.

571
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,668
I'll be right back.

572
00:34:16,702 --> 00:34:17,932
How far?

573
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,034
Just outside of Tempasa.

574
00:34:20,078 --> 00:34:21,206
I'll go with you.

575
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,452
Are you sure?

576
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:25,822
I know the area.

577
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:27,089
So does Gantt.

578
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:28,793
They didn't shoot
Gantt's father.

579
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:29,996
They shot mine.

580
00:34:31,775 --> 00:34:33,301
All right. Go!

581
00:34:36,287 --> 00:34:38,782
We found the soldiers
that did this to you.

582
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,558
I'm going to make them pay

583
00:34:40,598 --> 00:34:41,965
just like I promised.

584
00:34:42,001 --> 00:34:43,596
The others... let them.

585
00:34:43,638 --> 00:34:45,336
You don't have to go.

586
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:48,282
Yes, I do.
Yes, I do.

587
00:34:48,318 --> 00:34:50,050
I won't be long.

588
00:34:51,326 --> 00:34:52,990
Let's go!

589
00:35:08,871 --> 00:35:10,842
Come in.

590
00:35:14,786 --> 00:35:17,384
Um, I thought you should know
that, uh...

591
00:35:17,426 --> 00:35:20,058
Ghemor's condition
has deteriorated.

592
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,402
He'll be dead within the hour.

593
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:34,729
Thank you for the information,
Doctor.

594
00:35:34,771 --> 00:35:36,331
Is that it?

595
00:35:38,348 --> 00:35:41,584
"Thank you for the information"?

596
00:35:41,622 --> 00:35:43,616
Ghemor is dying.

597
00:35:43,661 --> 00:35:44,823
I heard you.

598
00:35:44,864 --> 00:35:47,462
Major, he wants to see you.

599
00:35:47,572 --> 00:35:50,067
Well, I don't want to see him.

600
00:35:50,112 --> 00:35:52,140
Major, please.

601
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:54,120
It's almost over.

602
00:35:54,155 --> 00:35:56,889
There's no more questions to ask

603
00:35:56,929 --> 00:35:58,991
no more work to be done.

604
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:02,440
Just go to his quarters
and sit with him.

605
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,413
I said no.

606
00:36:04,449 --> 00:36:06,147
Don't ask me again.

607
00:36:07,924 --> 00:36:09,986
Fine.

608
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:13,836
You must do what you want...

609
00:36:13,873 --> 00:36:15,901
but I think
you're making a mistake.

610
00:36:15,945 --> 00:36:18,474
Regardless of what Ghemor's
done in the past

611
00:36:18,585 --> 00:36:20,819
he doesn't deserve to die alone.

612
00:36:24,133 --> 00:36:25,397
Nobody does.

613
00:36:35,128 --> 00:36:37,862
All four mortar rounds
right in the central compound.

614
00:36:37,902 --> 00:36:39,132
And the way they ran...

615
00:36:39,172 --> 00:36:41,542
it was like kicking over
a mound of barrowbugs.

616
00:36:41,645 --> 00:36:42,636
What was the count?

617
00:36:42,681 --> 00:36:43,809
Five skimmers

618
00:36:43,851 --> 00:36:46,551
and at least, at least
15 Cardassian dead.

619
00:36:46,658 --> 00:36:48,892
Now, that's not
a bad day's work.

620
00:36:48,931 --> 00:36:50,561
We should celebrate, huh?

621
00:36:50,601 --> 00:36:52,572
Yeah, they kill us,
we kill them.

622
00:36:52,607 --> 00:36:54,943
It's nothing worth celebrating.

623
00:36:56,149 --> 00:36:57,482
Nerys.

624
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:59,513
Your father.

625
00:37:11,823 --> 00:37:14,523
He died calling your name.

626
00:37:18,407 --> 00:37:21,175
Get another raiding party
together.

627
00:37:21,214 --> 00:37:24,211
I want to hit
those Cardassians again

628
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:26,591
as soon as we have a chance.

629
00:37:48,452 --> 00:37:52,485
Would you, uh, like me
to call everyone together?

630
00:37:52,529 --> 00:37:55,662
Have Prylar Quen
say a few words.

631
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:58,608
There's nothing left to say.

632
00:38:23,877 --> 00:38:27,010
I didn't think you would come.

633
00:38:27,051 --> 00:38:29,853
Well, for a while
there, neither did I.

634
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,984
Cause of death was CNS failure

635
00:38:53,023 --> 00:38:55,257
brought on
by Yarim Fel syndrome.

636
00:38:55,296 --> 00:38:56,960
One witness was present...

637
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,802
a Major Kira Nerys
of the Bajoran Militia.

638
00:38:59,841 --> 00:39:02,336
Witness's statement is attached.

639
00:39:07,194 --> 00:39:09,393
Major, we're done here.

640
00:39:11,404 --> 00:39:12,896
That's it?

641
00:39:12,942 --> 00:39:14,138
A quick post-mortem

642
00:39:14,178 --> 00:39:15,978
a statement
from the witness

643
00:39:16,016 --> 00:39:18,386
and... a little paperwork?

644
00:39:21,096 --> 00:39:22,999
Seems so straightforward.

645
00:39:23,034 --> 00:39:25,404
It never is.

646
00:39:25,441 --> 00:39:29,508
He got so quiet...

647
00:39:29,551 --> 00:39:32,389
toward the end.

648
00:39:32,426 --> 00:39:36,061
I-I could hear him
whispering things...

649
00:39:36,102 --> 00:39:39,737
his wife's name,
Iliana's, even mine.

650
00:39:41,883 --> 00:39:44,378
Then the pain
just got too much for him

651
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,018
and he just lay there...

652
00:39:46,061 --> 00:39:49,229
breathing...

653
00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:53,804
And at the end
of every exhale...

654
00:39:53,848 --> 00:39:56,720
there was this pause,
and I thought, "That's it.

655
00:39:56,755 --> 00:39:58,885
It's over."

656
00:40:00,866 --> 00:40:04,364
Then he'd force
another breath...

657
00:40:04,408 --> 00:40:06,311
and another.

658
00:40:09,789 --> 00:40:12,991
I started counting them.

659
00:40:13,031 --> 00:40:15,435
One hundred...

660
00:40:15,471 --> 00:40:17,875
two hundred...

661
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:20,178
three hun...

662
00:40:23,157 --> 00:40:26,621
He fought for every last second.

663
00:40:29,507 --> 00:40:32,275
I don't think he even knew
that I was there.

664
00:40:32,314 --> 00:40:34,684
He knew.

665
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,954
You gave him what he needed.

666
00:40:36,993 --> 00:40:38,691
He didn't die alone.

667
00:40:41,304 --> 00:40:44,301
Maybe he gave me
something I needed.

668
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:51,492
I missed my father's death
by less than an hour.

669
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:53,729
Did you know that?

670
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,638
Less than an hour.

671
00:40:57,613 --> 00:41:01,146
I always told myself
that it was...

672
00:41:01,189 --> 00:41:04,858
bad luck, bad timing...

673
00:41:04,899 --> 00:41:07,667
the will of the Prophets.

674
00:41:09,811 --> 00:41:13,914
But the truth is...

675
00:41:13,955 --> 00:41:17,954
I didn't have to go when I did.

676
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:20,528
I could have stayed
a while longer.

677
00:41:20,573 --> 00:41:24,071
I saw my chance to get out

678
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:26,610
and I took it.

679
00:41:27,825 --> 00:41:31,790
I saw so much death
during the occupation.

680
00:41:31,902 --> 00:41:34,602
I felt so much pain that...

681
00:41:36,146 --> 00:41:39,120
But my father...

682
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:47,607
he was my strength

683
00:41:47,643 --> 00:41:53,090
and I, I couldn't stand to see
that strength slipping away.

684
00:41:55,329 --> 00:41:58,029
So, I ran.

685
00:41:58,069 --> 00:42:01,305
Just like you tried to run
from Ghemor.

686
00:42:01,345 --> 00:42:05,652
He reminded me so much
of my father.

687
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,492
Going through it again, I-I...

688
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:10,729
I just couldn't face it.

689
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,969
But in the end, you did.

690
00:42:13,008 --> 00:42:15,412
You were there for Ghemor.

691
00:42:15,448 --> 00:42:17,818
I owed it to him.

692
00:42:17,855 --> 00:42:19,849
I owed it to my father...

693
00:42:22,299 --> 00:42:24,703
to get it right this time.

694
00:42:36,503 --> 00:42:37,699
You wanted to see me?

695
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,902
Yes.

696
00:42:38,976 --> 00:42:43,283
I understand Legate Ghemor
has passed away.

697
00:42:43,321 --> 00:42:45,793
You must be very relieved.

698
00:42:45,827 --> 00:42:50,396
Oh, Captain,
such cynicism does not suit you.

699
00:42:50,439 --> 00:42:51,738
All of Cardassia

700
00:42:51,776 --> 00:42:55,046
will mourn the passing
of Tekeny Ghemor.

701
00:42:55,085 --> 00:42:56,554
He was a great man.

702
00:42:56,588 --> 00:42:58,650
I'm surprised
to hear you say that.

703
00:42:58,694 --> 00:42:59,856
Not at all.

704
00:42:59,897 --> 00:43:02,894
It takes a great man
to admit he's wrong

705
00:43:02,938 --> 00:43:04,909
and that's what Ghemor did.

706
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:08,348
I'm speaking of his
last-minute change of heart.

707
00:43:08,386 --> 00:43:11,188
His deathbed decision

708
00:43:11,226 --> 00:43:14,394
to embrace
the new Dominion government.

709
00:43:14,434 --> 00:43:18,935
That's very moving,
except for one small problem.

710
00:43:19,047 --> 00:43:20,847
It never happened.

711
00:43:21,988 --> 00:43:24,483
As you say,
it's... a small problem.

712
00:43:24,528 --> 00:43:28,699
I would like
his body transferred to my ship.

713
00:43:28,738 --> 00:43:33,547
We'll take him home and bury him
with full state honors.

714
00:43:34,854 --> 00:43:38,819
Well, I'm afraid
that's going to be impossible.

715
00:43:38,864 --> 00:43:41,895
Legate Ghemor's
funeral arrangements

716
00:43:41,939 --> 00:43:44,673
have already been taken care of.
