00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,927
Looks like he used
some kind of encryption program

00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:12,011
to bypass
the access protocols.

3
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:13,221
Unbelievable.

4
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:14,556
The nerve.

5
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,350
QUARK:

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,268
You wanted to see me.

Now don't pretend you don't

00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,148
Oh, well, maybe this'll
jog your memory.

Oh, I love the part where
my name rotates around.

15
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,580
Tampering with
the station's com system

16
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,207
is a class-3 offense.

17
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:43,711
It's just
a little advertisement.

18
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,754
I didn't post one in Ops.

19
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:46,839
I'm sure the magistrate

20
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:48,507
will take that

21
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:49,717

How did you do it?
Do what?

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,064
I ordered
a glass of prune juice

28
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,233
from the replicator
in the<i> Defiant's</i> mess.

29

Uh, let me help
you with that, Chief.

38
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,354
According to Chief O'Brien,

39
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:47,106
the scan resolution
on the new sensors is amazing.

40
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:48,442
We could practically do

41
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,069
the entire bio-survey
from orbit.

42
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:51,820
Suits me--
the sooner we get

43
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,948
out of the
Gamma Quadrant,
the better.

44
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:55,490
How can you say that?

45
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,910
Those little points
of light out there--

46
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,620
the great unknown,
beckoning to us.

47
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,871
I wish I could

48
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,623
visit every one.

49
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,542
You might want to skip the ones
with Jem'Hadar bases on them.

50
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,877
Is it my imagination,

51
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,670
or are the stars
a little brighter

52
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,464
in the Gamma Quadrant?

53
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,257
Is it my imagination,

54
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,593
or has Julian lost his mind?

55
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:18,722
Setting course for
the Gavara system.

56
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,569
(<i> console beeping</i> )

57
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,446
I'm picking up some kind
of emergency signal.

58
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:35,906
It's fragmented.

59
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,158
They say their homeworld's
been attacked...

60
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,327
massive destruction,
heavy casualties.

61
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,830
They're asking any passing
vessel for assistance.

62
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,205
Looks like the signal's

63
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,916
coming from somewhere
in the Teplan system.

64
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,043
That's just outside
Dominion space.

65
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,503
Well, let's hope the
Jem'Hadar know that.

66
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,671
Setting new course.

67
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,202
(<i> children yelling</i> )

68
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,199
What happened here?

69
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,039
H-Help me.

70
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,918
Don't let me die here.

71
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,711
Take me to Trevean.

72
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:13,754
Trevean?

73
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,672
Hospital...

74
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,133
I'll try to find
out where it is.

75
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:21,428
I'm going to give you
something for the pain.

76
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,933
You're not from
this world.

77
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,184
No.

78
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,061
The blight's
quickened in her.

79
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,938
There's nothing
you can do.

80
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,564
(<i> shivering</i> )

81
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,149
You should
leave here, now.

82
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,026
Go back to where
you came from

83
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,112
and forget about
this place.

84
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:43,570
The painkiller I gave her
isn't having much effect.

85
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,280
But their physiology is
so different from ours.

86
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,075
I doubt the blight will
be any danger to us.

87
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,035
I got us transportation
to the hospital.

88
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,912
How did you
manage that?

89
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,122
These aren't exactly
the friendliest people
I've ever met.

90
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,544
DAX:
I gave her
my hair clip.

Is everything all right?

94
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,566
This is
a hospital?

95
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,859
She's quickened.

(<i> woman moans and shivers</i> )

97
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,862
Take her to Trevean.

98
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,908
You're from
another world.

99
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:30,909
Yes.

100
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,452
Well, don't worry.

101
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,912
We'll take care
of her now.

102
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:38,792
I haven't seen
a single person

103
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,086
that doesn't have
lesions on their face.

104
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,337
His look inflamed.

105
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,884
So do that woman's
over there.

106
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,553
Like the woman
we brought in.

107
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:55,475
Trevean.

108
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,188
Thank you...

109
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,648
for this.

110
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,609
(<i> murmurs of "thank you"</i> )

111
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,153
You deserve nothing less.

112
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,698
Yesterday, when I woke up,

113
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:14,035
I... saw that
it had finally happened.

114
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,245
I'd quickened.

115
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,705
I always thought
I'd be afraid,

116
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,291
but I wasn't...

117
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,960
because I knew
I could come here.

118
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,629
Last night,
I slept in a bed

119
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,506
for the first time in my life.

120
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,718
I fell asleep
listening to music.

121
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,056
This morning,
I bathed in hot water,

122
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,766
dressed in clean clothes.

123
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,769
And now, I'm here with
my friends and family.

124
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,482
Thank you, Trevean...

125
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,403
for making this day everything
I dreamed it could be.

126
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:03,126
You brought Norva here?

127
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,462
How is she?
It was too late for her.

128
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,714
If only she'd come sooner,
I could've helped.

129
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,757
Then there<i> is</i> a treatment
for the blight.

130
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,634
There<i> is</i> no cure--
it's always fatal.

131
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,220
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

132
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,222
I thought you said you
could've helped her.

133
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,480
Why are you here?

134
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,065
We received
a distress call.

135
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,483
We're here to help
in any way we can.

136
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:27,567
I'm a doctor.

137
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,319
And I have access

138
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,321
to sophisticated
diagnostic equipment.

139
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,366
We had sophisticated
equipment once.

140
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:37,118
You think our world
was always this way?

141
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,995
Two centuries ago,

142
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,330
we were no different
from you.

143
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,249
We built vast cities,

144
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,834
traveled to neighboring worlds.

145
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,879
We believed nothing
was beyond our abilities.

146
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,881
We even thought
we could resist
the Dominion.

147
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,052
I see you've
heard of them.

148
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,221
Then take care not to defy them,

149
00:09:56,221 --> 00:10:00,434
or your people will pay
the same price we did.

150
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:04,271
The Jem'Hadar
destroyed our world

151
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,980
as an example to others.

152
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,694
Bring me Milani's child.

153
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:17,075
More than anything,
the Dominion wanted my people

154
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,494
to bear the mark
of their defiance.

155
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,371
So...

156
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,499
they brought us
the blight.

157
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,626
We're all born
with it...

158
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,670
we all die from it.

159
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,590
When the blight quickens,

160
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,592
the lesions turn red.

161
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,676
Death soon follows--

162
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,887
some in childhood,

163
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,599
most before they can have
children of their own.

164
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,101
Only a few live
to be my age.

165
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:46,938
Trevean, if you tell us
what you know about the blight,

166
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,023
we may be able to help.

167
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,943
No.

168
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,903
You should go.

169
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,989
If the Jem'Hadar
find you here...

170
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:59,117
We're willing
to take that risk.

171
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,369
(<i> dishes clattering,</i>
<i>man gasping</i> )

172
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,745
Don't.

173
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,457
Make some room.
I'm a doctor.

174
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:06,666
MAN:
Leave him alone.

175
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,709
You don't understand.

176
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,171
Can't you see he's dying?

177
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,590
Of course, he's dying--
he came here to die.

178
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,716
People come to me
when they quicken.

179
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,136
I help them leave
this world peacefully--

180
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,180
surrounded by their
families and friends.

181
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,015
What are you saying?

182
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:27,395
The herbs I give them
causes death within minutes.

183
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,440
You poison them.

184
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,108
The blight kills slowly.

185
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,528
No one wants to
suffer needlessly--

186
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,821
not like that woman
you brought me.

187
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,781
You killed her?

188
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,619
I did what she asked.

189
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,871
I thought this
was a hospital,

190
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,290
and that you
were a healer.

191
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,125
I am.

192
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,670
I take away pain.

193
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,463
Now you've disrupted
Tamar's death.

194
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,048
I'll going to have
to ask you to leave.

195
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,380
I found the
distress beacon

196
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,590
in an abandoned
building

197
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,840
not far from here.

198
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,884
It has its own
power source.

199
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,928
My guess is

200
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,972
it's been repeating
the same message
for over 200 years.

201
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,642
Well, there's nothing
for us to do here.

202
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:48,893
We should go.

203
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,022
Are you really
a doctor?

204
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,234
Yes.

205
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,570
I've never met
a doctor before.

206
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,154
They say
there's a woman

207
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:03,032
in Nykalia
who makes a medicine

208
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,076
that helps people withstand
the pain of quickening

209
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:08,455
so... so they
can live longer.

210
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:09,748
I'd go there,

211
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:12,041
but Nykalia's
so far away.

212
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,668
When are you due?

213
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,671
Not for another two months.
That's not very long.

214
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,758
We never know
when the quickening will come.

215
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,926
I'm Julian.

216
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,094
What's your name?

217
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,763
Ekoria.

218
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:27,766
I'm Jadzia.

219
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:30,310
Did you come here to help us?

220
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,104
Well, nobody around here
seems to want our help.

221
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,022
I do.

222
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,358
And I know others
who would welcome it, too.

223
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,319
Kira to away team.
Go ahead.

224
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,861
The sensors just picked up

225
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,863
two Jem'Hadar ships
headed this way.

226
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,459
The Jem'Hadar are leaving
the Kendi system,

227
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,003
and it looks like
they're headings
for the Obatta cluster.

228
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,921
Sounds like they're
on a patrol route,

229
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,174
which means this system
is probably next.

230
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,551
We'd better go.
Stand by to
get underway.

231
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,679
Hold on, Major.

232
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,180
We can't just leave
these people.

233
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,683
They need our help.
And they'll
get it.

234
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,850
As soon as we get back,
we'll notify Starfleet

235
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,645
so they can put together
a relief mission.

236
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,772
But that could take weeks,
maybe even months.

237
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,315
We're here, now.

238
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:20,443
Remember the plague
on Boranis III?

239
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:21,861
People were dying
by the thousands

240
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,530
and nobody there knew why.

241
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,865
It took us one hour
to identify the pathogen,

242
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,408
and three days
to dose the water table

243
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,661
and inoculate
the entire population.

244
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,746
We might be able to do
the same thing here.

245
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,166
All right, it's worth a try.

246
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,044
We can't risk the Jem'Hadar
detecting the runabout.

247
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,839
I'll take it
to the Jenkata nebula.

248
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:43,049
Come back for us in a week.

249
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,342
With any luck,
we'll have a cure by then.

250
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,856
(<i> talking quietly</i> )

251
00:14:57,856 --> 00:15:00,941
They're here.

252
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,819
They're coming.

253
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,470
Thanks.

254
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,305
Go, go, go on.

255
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:36,686
Um... I'm sorry I can't
offer you more space.

256
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,438
Oh, don't be.
This is fine.

257
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,023
Um, can I use this table
to set up my equipment?

258
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,442
Whatever you need.

259
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,246
Did you do this?

260
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,664
My husband did.

261
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,919
He died last winter.

262
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:04,923
It's what he imagined
our world used to be like.

263
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:06,716
He painted a mural
similar to that

264
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,051
on a building near here--

265
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,054
traded a good pair of boots
for the paint he needed.

266
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:15,224
He wanted to show people
the way things were--

267
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,937
thought it might give them
something to work toward.

268
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,524
Well, maybe later, you
can take us to see it.

269
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,067
All right.

270
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,698
Well, it looks like we
have ourselves a clinic.

271
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,618
The first thing I have to do
is run a complete

272
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:36,496
bio-spectral analysis
on an asymptomatic individual.

273
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,791
Loosely translated,

274
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,501
that means he needs
a volunteer.

275
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,505
DAX:
Great.

276
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,340
Now, if you'll
just have a seat,

277
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,634
the doctor will be
with you in a moment.

278
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,723
They<i> love</i> to keep
you waiting.

279
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,685
It, uh, makes them
feel important.

280
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,020
How would you like to see
a picture of your baby?

281
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,487
There it is.

282
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,740
Let me see.

283
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,992
Wh-What's happened?

284
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,244
We've isolated the virus.

285
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,329
Is that a good thing?

286
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,915
It means we can
start analyzing

287
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:04,083
its molecular structure--
look for binding sites

288
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,752
so we can tailor
an antigen.

289
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,503
DAX:
In other words, yes.

290
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,005
It's a very good thing.

291
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:13,300
I'm going to start
mapping nucleotides.

292
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,428
Can you run a
protein sequencer?

293
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,888
I think so.

294
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:23,394
I... I hope you two
are hungry.

295
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,229
Starving.

296
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,731
Good.

297
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,816
That looks like a feast.

298
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,443
It was supposed to be.

299
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,111
What do you mean?

300
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,989
Nothing.

301
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,492
Do you like Takana root tea?

302
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,916
Ekoria...

303
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,711
where did you
get all this food?

304
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:51,338
I've been saving it
for the hospital...

305
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,091
for my death.

306
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,884
But something tells me

307
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,261
I'm not going
to need it anymore.

308
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,851
Well, thanks anyway.

309
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,520
She's not interested either.

310
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,981
I hope Dax
is having better luck.

311
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,857
I don't understand
why you need people

312
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,609
who've quickened
to make your cure.

313
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,653
Well, I need to chart
the progress of the viral--

314
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,863
I'm sorry.

315
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,406
Oh, you're still here.

316
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,908
Yes.

317
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,577
Well, I see the blight
has spared you.

318
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,246
Maybe it doesn't like
the taste of your blood.

319
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,708
Unfortunately,
it seems to like yours.

320
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,127
Well, I'd invite you
to my death,

321
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:30,920
but we don't know
each other that well.

322
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,047
What if I told you
there was a chance

323
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,465
you didn't have to die?

324
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,217
I'm a doctor.

325
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,469
(<i> laughing</i> )

326
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,596
Don't tell me--
you have a cure.

327
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,806
I'm working on one.

328
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,182
Yeah, what'll
it cost me?

329
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,350
A good coat?

330
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,810
A tilo of oil?

331
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,562
It won't cost you anything.

332
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,481
He can help us.

333
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,316
Listen to him.

334
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:56,112
I need volunteers,
people who have quickened.

335
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,447
What will you do?
See how loud we scream

336
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,991
when the blight
burns through us?

337
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,408
(<i> crowd laughs</i> )

338
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,494
I have medicines
that can dull the pain.

339
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:06,580
I have equipment unlike
anything on your world.

340
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,542
How would you like me
to fix that arm

341
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,670
so you can play with
your friends over there?

342
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:16,382
I'm not going
to hurt you.

343
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:27,434
Well, you have a
fracture right here.

344
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,520
I bet it hurts.

345
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,080
Better?

346
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,125
(<i> astonished murmurs</i> )

347
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,626
WOMAN:
Did you see that?

348
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,963
How did you do that?

349
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,840
EKORIA:
Does it matter?

350
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,676
He can find a cure for us

351
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,969
if we help him.

352
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,558
Fixing a broken bone
and curing the blight

353
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:08,726
are two different things.

354
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,811
I know that.

355
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,983
Others have come here
with promises of a cure.

356
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:19,361
They stirred up hope,
took food and clothing

357
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,781
in exchange
for their elixirs,

358
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,784
but their promises
were always lies.

What's wrong?

371
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:15,626
Oh, I've been trying to chart
the life cycle of the virus.

372
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:19,088
It would be a lot easier if
I'd gotten more tissue samples.

Maybe you should go home.

374

Maybe my people
don't deserve your help.

375
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:28,639
Oh, they've just
been suffering so long,

376
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,184
they've lost hope
that things can be better.

377
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:32,768
It's more than that.

378
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,646
We've come to worship death.

379
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,154
I used to wake up
and look at myself in the mirror

380
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:46,866
and be disappointed
I hadn't quickened in my sleep.

381
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,118
Going to Trevean
seemed so much easier

382
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,744
than going on living.

383
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,164
Yet, you don't feel
that way anymore.

384
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,917
Not since the baby.

385
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,714
My little boy.

386
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,926

I...

392

I want to be here for him...

393
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:28,074
to hold his hand
when he takes his first step,

394
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:31,493
kiss his knee
when he scrapes it in a fall.

395
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:35,373
Well, with any luck, you'll see
him have children of his own.

401
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,068
I canceled my death for you.

402
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,199
I was really looking forward
to it.

403
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:26,882
All right.

404
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,176
Everybody gets

(<i> hypospray whooshes</i> )

407

Perfect.

408
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,572
There. This'll
dull the pain.

409
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:56,036
I like your spots.

410
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,747
You told me
that yesterday.

411
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,625
I still like them.

(<i> quietly</i> ):
Julian.

413
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,681
Epran has stopped
responding

414
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,224
to the cordrazine.

415
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,934
I had to put him in
an inhibitor field.

416
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,727
He's further along
than everyone else.

417
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:23,814
I'm hoping he'll be
the first to respond
to the antigen.

418
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:26,275
Think of it.

419
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:29,403
She may well be holding
the cure in her hands.

420
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:32,739
Do you think we should tell
her what she's giving them?

421
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:35,533
She's nervous enough
about using the hypo.

422
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:38,371
It's better if we wait
till we're positive.

423
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,040
I suppose.

424
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,210
You should take a break.

425
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,046
You've been working
nonstop for days.

426
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:12,446
Doctor?

427
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:13,989
Oh...

428
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,741
Dax wanted me to tell you

429
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,784
that Epran's white blood count
is up another 12 percent.

430
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,412
That's great news.

431
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:20,454
It is?

432
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:21,539
Trust me.

433
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:22,831
I do.

434
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,458
I did from the start.

435
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,544
I don't... really know why.

436
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:29,088
Well, I'd like to think
it's my bedside manner.

437
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,089
Hmm?

438
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:33,133
Um... doctors and nurses

439
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:36,845
are supposed to project
an air of caring competence.

440
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,680
You were doing it in there.

441
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,641
Me?
I was watching you.

442
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,561
You're very good with patients.

443
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:45,603
Oh, I was just trying
to be kind.

444
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:48,023
Well, some people don't like
to be around the sick.

445
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,983
It reminds them
of their own mortality.

446
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,486
It doesn't bother you?

447
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:54,280
Sometimes.

448
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,950
I prefer to confront mortality
rather than hide from it.

449
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,785
When you make someone well,

450
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:02,955
it's like
you're chasing death off--

451
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,832
making him wait
for another day.

452
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,043
But death comes
to everyone eventually.

453
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,254
Except Kukalaka.

454
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:13,173
Kuka... who?

455
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,716
My first patient.

456
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,260
A teddy bear.

457
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,803
What's that?

458
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,599
Oh, it's a sort of, um...

459
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:24,684
soft puppet.

460
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,395
Anyway, when
I was a little boy,

461
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:28,230
I took him
everywhere I went

462
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:32,067
and after a few years,
he became a little threadbare,

463
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,320
until eventually his leg tore,

464
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,988
and some
of the stuffing fell out.

465
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,031
My mother was all set
to throw him out,

466
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,950
but I wouldn't have it because
at the tender age of five,

467
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,244
I performed my first surgery.

468
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,703
I restuffed him,

469
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,289
and sewed
his leg closed.

470
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:46,832
From that day on,

471
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,792
I did everything
I could

472
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,961
to keep Kukalaka
in one piece.

473
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:53,839
You know, I must have
sewn and stitched

474
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,134
and repatched every square inch
of that bear.

475
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:59,719
Why were you so determined
to keep him together?

476
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,014
Well, I wouldn't be
much of a doctor

477
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,642
if I gave up on a patient,
would I?

478
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:09,355
Where's Kukalaka now?

479
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:10,939
Oh, in a closet somewhere.

00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,711
Isn't it?

541
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:05,883
I'm going to tell you
a little secret, Jadzia.

542
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:08,844
I was looking forward
to tomorrow--

543
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:12,055
to seeing Kira again
and casually asking,

544
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,057
"How was the nebula?

545
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,975
"And, oh, by the way,

546
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,478
I cured that blight thing
those people had."

547
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:23,734
It's not a crime to believe
in yourself, Julian.

548
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:25,903
These people
believed in me

549
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:27,863
and look where it got them.

550
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,368
Trevean was right.

551
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,245
There<i> is</i> no cure.

552
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:38,164
The Dominion
made sure of that.

553
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,708
And I was so arrogant,

554
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,835
I thought I could
find one in a week.

555
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,637
Maybe it was arrogant
to think that,

556
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:55,557
but it's even more arrogant
to think there isn't a cure

557
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:58,727
just because<i> you</i>
couldn't find it.

558
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:36,181
I'm glad you got a chance
to see it before you left.

559
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:40,853
Ekoria.

560
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:47,108
I thought I'd make it.

561
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,735
I really did.

562
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,570
I'm sorry.

563
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,905
Don't be.

564
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:54,157
You gave me hope.

565
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:57,160
I haven't felt that
since before my husband died.

566
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,668
Good-bye.

567
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,630
Ekoria...
wait.

568
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,888
You're sure about this?

569
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:18,807
I can't leave
these people.

570
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:21,434
Not now.

571
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,937
Whenever you're ready,
contact the station.

572
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:25,689
We'll have a runabout here
within days.

573
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:31,194
You know what
worries me, Julian?

574
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,946
Is that without me,

575
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:34,489
you won't have anyone
to translate for you.

576
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:40,078
Good luck.

577
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,623
Major?

578
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,960
(<i> Bashir sighs</i> )

579
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,419
What is it?

580
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:34,257
There isn't a trace
of the antigen I gave you

581
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,842
in your bloodstream.

582
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,970
Your immune system
must have rejected it.

583
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,139
Oh...

584
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,601
Is it bad?

585
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,686
Mm-hmm...

586
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,523
I can give you another hypo,

587
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,985
but you have so much cordrazine
in your system already,

588
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:55,194
it might be hard
on the baby's metabolism.

589
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,658
I'll wait.

590
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,559
What is that smell?

591
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,062
I'm making a salve.

592
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:31,564
Long as I don't
have to drink it.

593
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:36,736
How do you feel?

594
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,446
I've been better.

595
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,781
Can you sit up?

596
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:47,039
Breathe.

597
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,582
(<i> ragged breath</i> )

598
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:52,836
Again?

599
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:01,011
Let's see how the baby's doing.

600
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,690
His head's over here now.

601
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,358
I'm not surprised.

602
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,904
Feels like he's
turning somersaults in there.

603
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:31,332
His heart's getting stronger
every day.

604
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:35,461
I'd say another six weeks.

605
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:40,842
I'll never make it that long.

606
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:44,596
Well, I can induce
labor in two weeks.

607
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:48,016
The baby'll be old
enough by then.

608
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,979
Two weeks.

609
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:22,175
Trevean...

610
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,761
am I dead?

611
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:26,471
Is that what you want?

612
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,640
I can end
your suffering.

613
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:35,438
Your child will have known
nothing but peace.

614
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,070
No.

615
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:46,116
He deserves a
chance to live.

616
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:48,367
The blight will take him
in the end.

617
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:51,871
Trevean...

618
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:56,793
I didn't realize
you made house calls.

619
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,385
I was concerned that she might
be too weak to come to me.

620
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,598
I don't understand...

621
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,226
why you're so
obsessed with death.

622
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:14,936
From what I've heard,

623
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:17,856
you've lived with the blight
longer than anyone.

624
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,691
Yes...

625
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:22,152
and I've seen more
suffering than anyone.

626
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:27,532
Good-bye, Ekoria.

627
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:30,910
I hope you live long enough
to see your baby.

628
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,343
Trevean
means well.

629
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:50,347
He's a kind man
in his own way.

630
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,238
(<i> crying in pain</i> )

631
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:07,572
Push!

632
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,657
Good. Good. Now breathe.

633
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,034
Don't stop breathing.

634
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:12,618
Don't stop. Breathe.

635
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,745
I can see his head.

636
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,456
And push!

637
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,542

Yes, push!

640
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,015
Yes! Yes.

My God.

643
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:50,782
That's why there's no antigen
in your system.

644
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,661
It's all been absorbed
through the placenta.

645

Ekoria...

646
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,712
he doesn't have any lesions.

647
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,090
He doesn't have the blight.

(<i> crying</i> )

649
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,967
You found a cure.

650
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:52,135
It's not a cure.

651
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:53,594
It's a vaccine.

652
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,305
Every pregnant woman

653
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:57,349
should be inoculated with
it as soon as possible.

654
00:41:57,349 --> 00:42:00,477
It won't help them,
but it<i> will</i> protect
their babies.

655
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:02,645
Our children
won't have the blight?

656
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:05,190
The vaccine isn't
difficult to make,

657
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,567
but seeing that everybody
gets it will be a huge task.

658
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,488
Oh, not a task...

659
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:12,947
a privilege.

660
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:16,034
Can you show me how to make it?

661
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:19,162
