1
00:00:07,244 --> 00:00:10,082
Looks like he used
some kind of encryption program

2
00:00:10,118 --> 00:00:11,918
to bypass the access protocols.

3
00:00:11,956 --> 00:00:13,357
Unbelievable.

4
00:00:13,393 --> 00:00:14,521
The nerve.

5
00:00:14,562 --> 00:00:16,362
Major?

6
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:18,167
You wanted to see me.

7
00:00:18,205 --> 00:00:21,475
Now don't pretend you don't
know what this is about.

8
00:00:21,514 --> 00:00:23,417
Oh, well, maybe this'll
jog your memory.

9
00:00:23,452 --> 00:00:25,720
Engage monitor.

10
00:00:25,758 --> 00:00:27,888
Come to Quark's,
Quark's is fun

11
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:30,095
Come right now,
don't walk, run!

12
00:00:33,779 --> 00:00:36,547
Oh, I love the part where
my name rotates around.

13
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:38,785
Tampering with
the station's com system

14
00:00:38,826 --> 00:00:40,592
is a class-3 offense.

15
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,934
It's just
a little advertisement.

16
00:00:43,972 --> 00:00:46,171
I didn't post one in Ops.

17
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,238
I'm sure the magistrate

18
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:48,773
will take that
into consideration

19
00:00:48,818 --> 00:00:50,151
when he calculates
your fine.

20
00:00:53,163 --> 00:00:54,689
You!

21
00:00:54,733 --> 00:00:58,197
As you can see, we're very busy
here... station business.

22
00:00:58,243 --> 00:01:00,613
How did you do it?

23
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:01,618
Do what?

24
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:04,249
I ordered
a glass of prune juice

25
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:06,594
from the replicator
in the <i>Defiant's</i> mess.

26
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:10,198
This is what it came in.

27
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,006
Come to Quark's,
Quark's is fun...

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,156
If all your little
advertisements

29
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:18,958
aren't purged from our systems

30
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:21,126
by the time I get back
from the Gamma Quadrant

31
00:01:21,169 --> 00:01:23,037
I will come to Quark's

32
00:01:23,074 --> 00:01:24,738
and believe me...

33
00:01:24,778 --> 00:01:26,510
I will have fun.

34
00:01:32,499 --> 00:01:35,199
Uh, let me help
you with that, Chief.

35
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,695
According to Chief O'Brien

36
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,464
the scan resolution
on the new sensors is amazing.

37
00:01:47,504 --> 00:01:48,837
We could practically do

38
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:50,538
the entire bio-survey
from orbit.

39
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,209
Suits me... the sooner we get

40
00:01:52,249 --> 00:01:54,379
out of the Gamma Quadrant,
the better.

41
00:01:54,422 --> 00:01:55,891
How can you say that?

42
00:01:55,926 --> 00:01:58,194
Those little points
of light out there...

43
00:01:58,232 --> 00:02:00,135
the great unknown,
beckoning to us.

44
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,734
I wish I could visit every one.

45
00:02:02,777 --> 00:02:06,310
You might want to skip the ones
with Jem'Hadar bases on them.

46
00:02:06,353 --> 00:02:07,322
Is it my imagination

47
00:02:07,355 --> 00:02:08,915
or are the stars
a little brighter

48
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,760
in the Gamma Quadrant?

49
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,564
Is it my imagination

50
00:02:12,603 --> 00:02:15,702
or has Julian lost his mind?

51
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:19,150
Setting course
for the Gavara system.

52
00:02:32,454 --> 00:02:34,790
I'm picking up some kind
of emergency signal.

53
00:02:34,826 --> 00:02:36,261
It's fragmented.

54
00:02:36,297 --> 00:02:38,565
They say their homeworld's
been attacked...

55
00:02:38,603 --> 00:02:40,597
massive destruction,
heavy casualties.

56
00:02:40,642 --> 00:02:43,308
They're asking any passing
vessel for assistance.

57
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:44,409
Looks like the signal's

58
00:02:44,452 --> 00:02:46,446
coming from somewhere
in the Teplan system.

59
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,358
That's just outside
Dominion space.

60
00:02:48,395 --> 00:02:49,864
Well, let's hope
the Jem'Hadar know that.

61
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:51,163
Setting new course.

62
00:03:58,945 --> 00:04:00,779
What happened here?

63
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:07,456
H-Help me.

64
00:04:09,573 --> 00:04:11,373
Don't let me die here.

65
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:13,211
Take me to Trevean.

66
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:14,240
Trevean?

67
00:04:14,285 --> 00:04:16,051
Hospital...

68
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,459
I'll try to find out
where it is.

69
00:04:18,496 --> 00:04:21,994
I'm going to give you
something for the pain.

70
00:04:24,444 --> 00:04:26,415
You're not from this world.

71
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,749
No.

72
00:04:27,787 --> 00:04:29,587
The blight's quickened in her.

73
00:04:29,692 --> 00:04:31,424
There's nothing you can do.

74
00:04:32,967 --> 00:04:34,597
You should leave here, now.

75
00:04:34,671 --> 00:04:36,539
Go back to where you came from

76
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,775
and forget about this place.

77
00:06:41,131 --> 00:06:43,695
The painkiller I gave her
isn't having much effect.

78
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,469
But their physiology is
so different from ours.

79
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:48,175
I doubt the blight will
be any danger to us.

80
00:06:48,216 --> 00:06:50,153
I got us transportation
to the hospital.

81
00:06:50,187 --> 00:06:51,679
How did you manage that?

82
00:06:51,725 --> 00:06:53,355
These aren't exactly
the friendliest people

83
00:06:53,395 --> 00:06:54,455
I've ever met.

84
00:06:57,773 --> 00:07:00,211
I gave her my hair clip.

85
00:07:11,376 --> 00:07:12,845
Is everything all right?

86
00:07:20,165 --> 00:07:22,535
This is a hospital?

87
00:07:22,605 --> 00:07:23,631
She's quickened.

88
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:26,846
Take her to Trevean.

89
00:07:28,921 --> 00:07:30,653
You're from another world.

90
00:07:30,693 --> 00:07:31,684
Yes.

91
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:33,130
Well, don't worry.

92
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,692
We'll take care of her now.

93
00:07:38,012 --> 00:07:39,572
I haven't seen a single person

94
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:41,848
that doesn't have
lesions on their face.

95
00:07:41,888 --> 00:07:43,255
His look inflamed.

96
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,697
So do that woman's over there.

97
00:07:49,775 --> 00:07:51,439
Like the woman we brought in.

98
00:07:55,356 --> 00:07:56,382
Trevean.

99
00:07:59,234 --> 00:08:00,966
Thank you...

100
00:08:01,004 --> 00:08:02,473
for this.

101
00:08:05,282 --> 00:08:07,082
You deserve nothing less.

102
00:08:08,658 --> 00:08:11,392
Yesterday, when I woke up

103
00:08:11,432 --> 00:08:14,838
I... saw that
it had finally happened.

104
00:08:14,874 --> 00:08:15,737
I'd quickened.

105
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,240
I always thought I'd be afraid

106
00:08:18,277 --> 00:08:19,769
but I wasn't...

107
00:08:19,814 --> 00:08:22,446
because I knew
I could come here.

108
00:08:22,488 --> 00:08:25,188
Last night, I slept in a bed

109
00:08:25,228 --> 00:08:27,062
for the first time in my life.

110
00:08:28,102 --> 00:08:31,235
I fell asleep
listening to music.

111
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:35,548
This morning,
I bathed in hot water

112
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:37,219
dressed in clean clothes.

113
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:40,495
And now, I'm here with
my friends and family.

114
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,076
Thank you, Trevean...

115
00:08:45,548 --> 00:08:49,012
for making this day everything
I dreamed it could be.

116
00:09:01,355 --> 00:09:03,589
You brought Norva here?

117
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:04,926
How is she?

118
00:09:04,965 --> 00:09:05,956
It was too late for her.

119
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,130
If only she'd come sooner,
I could've helped.

120
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,201
Then there is a treatment
for the blight.

121
00:09:10,245 --> 00:09:12,341
There is no cure...
it's always fatal.

122
00:09:12,383 --> 00:09:13,978
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

123
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:16,049
I thought you said you
could've helped her.

124
00:09:22,711 --> 00:09:24,648
Why are you here?

125
00:09:24,682 --> 00:09:25,776
We received a distress call.

126
00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:27,311
We're here to help
in any way we can.

127
00:09:27,356 --> 00:09:28,347
I'm a doctor.

128
00:09:28,392 --> 00:09:30,022
And I have access

129
00:09:30,063 --> 00:09:32,227
to sophisticated
diagnostic equipment.

130
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:35,106
We had sophisticated
equipment once.

131
00:09:35,143 --> 00:09:37,843
You think our world
was always this way?

132
00:09:37,883 --> 00:09:41,221
Two centuries ago,
we were no different from you.

133
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:42,923
We built vast cities

134
00:09:42,963 --> 00:09:45,435
traveled to neighboring worlds.

135
00:09:45,536 --> 00:09:48,601
We believed nothing
was beyond our abilities.

136
00:09:48,644 --> 00:09:50,843
We even thought we could resist
the Dominion.

137
00:09:52,387 --> 00:09:54,791
I see you've heard of them.

138
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,991
Then take care not to defy them

139
00:09:57,033 --> 00:10:00,007
or your people will pay
the same price we did.

140
00:10:01,812 --> 00:10:04,980
The Jem'Hadar
destroyed our world

141
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,957
as an example to others.

142
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:12,531
Bring me Milani's child.

143
00:10:14,645 --> 00:10:17,915
More than anything,
the Dominion wanted my people

144
00:10:17,954 --> 00:10:20,188
to bear the mark
of their defiance.

145
00:10:21,195 --> 00:10:22,289
So...

146
00:10:23,568 --> 00:10:25,539
they brought us the blight.

147
00:10:25,573 --> 00:10:27,339
We're all born with it...

148
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:30,352
we all die from it.

149
00:10:30,386 --> 00:10:34,294
When the blight quickens,
the lesions turn red.

150
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:36,391
Death soon follows...

151
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,429
some in childhood

152
00:10:38,474 --> 00:10:41,208
most before they can have
children of their own.

153
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:43,583
Only a few live to be my age.

154
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,585
Trevean, if you tell us
what you know about the blight

155
00:10:47,631 --> 00:10:49,659
we may be able to help.

156
00:10:50,806 --> 00:10:52,606
No.

157
00:10:52,644 --> 00:10:54,444
You should go.

158
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:56,783
If the Jem'Hadar
find you here...

159
00:10:56,821 --> 00:10:59,316
We're willing
to take that risk.

160
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:03,466
Don't.

161
00:11:03,505 --> 00:11:04,769
Make some room.

162
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:06,005
I'm a doctor.

163
00:11:06,045 --> 00:11:07,207
Leave him alone.

164
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,483
You don't understand.

165
00:11:09,521 --> 00:11:11,685
Can't you see he's dying?

166
00:11:11,727 --> 00:11:14,199
Of course, he's dying...
he came here to die.

167
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:16,295
People come to me
when they quicken.

168
00:11:16,338 --> 00:11:18,606
I help them leave
this world peacefully...

169
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,912
surrounded by their families
and friends.

170
00:11:20,951 --> 00:11:22,979
What are you saying?

171
00:11:24,326 --> 00:11:28,291
The herbs I give them
causes death within minutes.

172
00:11:28,337 --> 00:11:31,139
You poison them.

173
00:11:31,177 --> 00:11:32,977
The blight kills slowly.

174
00:11:33,015 --> 00:11:35,317
No one wants
to suffer needlessly...

175
00:11:35,355 --> 00:11:37,657
not like that woman
you brought me.

176
00:11:37,695 --> 00:11:39,632
You killed her?

177
00:11:40,836 --> 00:11:43,331
I did what she asked.

178
00:11:43,376 --> 00:11:45,678
I thought this was a hospital

179
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:48,253
and that you were a healer.

180
00:11:48,288 --> 00:11:49,952
I am.

181
00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:52,464
I take away pain.

182
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:54,265
Now you've disrupted
Tamar's death.

183
00:11:54,304 --> 00:11:56,070
I'll going to have
to ask you to leave.

184
00:12:34,641 --> 00:12:36,236
I found the distress beacon

185
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:38,615
in an abandoned building
not far from here.

186
00:12:38,652 --> 00:12:40,748
It has its own power source.

187
00:12:40,824 --> 00:12:44,391
My guess is it's been
repeating the same message

188
00:12:44,434 --> 00:12:45,903
for over 200 years.

189
00:12:45,938 --> 00:12:48,570
Well, there's nothing
for us to do here.

190
00:12:48,612 --> 00:12:49,979
We should go.

191
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,087
Are you really a doctor?

192
00:12:56,031 --> 00:12:57,125
Yes.

193
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,400
I've never met a doctor before.

194
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:03,678
They say there's a woman
in Nykalia who makes a medicine

195
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:05,916
that helps people withstand
the pain of quickening

196
00:13:05,957 --> 00:13:09,421
so... so they can live longer.

197
00:13:09,465 --> 00:13:10,491
I'd go there

198
00:13:10,535 --> 00:13:12,871
but Nykalia's so far away.

199
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:14,434
When are you due?

200
00:13:14,478 --> 00:13:16,244
Not for another two months.

201
00:13:16,283 --> 00:13:17,718
That's not very long.

202
00:13:17,753 --> 00:13:20,727
We never know
when the quickening will come.

203
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:23,063
I'm Julian.

204
00:13:23,101 --> 00:13:24,161
What's your name?

205
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:25,970
Ekoria.

206
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:28,949
I'm Jadzia.

207
00:13:28,983 --> 00:13:31,387
Did you come here to help us?

208
00:13:31,422 --> 00:13:34,224
Well, nobody around here
seems to want our help.

209
00:13:34,263 --> 00:13:35,995
I do.

210
00:13:36,035 --> 00:13:38,701
And I know others
who would welcome it, too.

211
00:13:38,742 --> 00:13:39,711
Kira to away team.

212
00:13:39,744 --> 00:13:40,609
Go ahead.

213
00:13:40,647 --> 00:13:42,116
The sensors just picked up

214
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,212
two Jem'Hadar ships
headed this way.

215
00:13:54,349 --> 00:13:56,513
The Jem'Hadar are leaving
the Kendi system

216
00:13:56,554 --> 00:13:57,989
and it looks like
they're heading

217
00:13:58,025 --> 00:13:59,085
for the Obatta cluster.

218
00:13:59,127 --> 00:14:00,961
Sounds like they're
on a patrol route

219
00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:03,437
which means this system
is probably next.

220
00:14:03,472 --> 00:14:04,441
We'd better go.

221
00:14:04,475 --> 00:14:05,535
Stand by to get underway.

222
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,515
Hold on, Major.

223
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,384
We can't just leave
these people.

224
00:14:09,421 --> 00:14:10,515
They need our help.

225
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,549
And they'll get it.

226
00:14:11,593 --> 00:14:13,861
As soon as we get back,
we'll notify Starfleet

227
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:15,733
so they can put together
a relief mission.

228
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:16,865
But that could take weeks

229
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:18,103
maybe even months.

230
00:14:18,144 --> 00:14:19,204
We're here, now.

231
00:14:19,247 --> 00:14:22,346
Remember the plague
on Boranis III?

232
00:14:22,388 --> 00:14:23,857
People were dying
by the thousands

233
00:14:23,892 --> 00:14:25,418
and nobody there knew why.

234
00:14:25,463 --> 00:14:27,662
It took us one hour
to identify the pathogen

235
00:14:27,702 --> 00:14:29,297
and three days
to dose the water table

236
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,574
and inoculate
the entire population.

237
00:14:31,612 --> 00:14:33,948
We might be able to do
the same thing here.

238
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:37,019
All right, it's worth a try.

239
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:40,124
We can't risk the Jem'Hadar
detecting the runabout.

240
00:14:40,168 --> 00:14:42,834
I'll take it
to the Jenkata nebula.

241
00:14:42,874 --> 00:14:44,868
Come back for us in a week.

242
00:14:44,914 --> 00:14:46,440
With any luck,
we'll have a cure by then.

243
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:01,046
They're here.

244
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,794
They're coming.

245
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:31,390
Thanks.

246
00:15:31,434 --> 00:15:33,428
Go, go, go on.

247
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,236
Um...

248
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,878
I'm sorry I can't
offer you more space.

249
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,389
Oh, don't be.
This is fine.

250
00:15:40,424 --> 00:15:43,022
Um, can I use this table
to set up my equipment?

251
00:15:43,064 --> 00:15:44,556
Whatever you need.

252
00:15:55,764 --> 00:15:57,233
Did you do this?

253
00:15:57,267 --> 00:15:58,759
My husband did.

254
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:02,845
He died last winter.

255
00:16:02,882 --> 00:16:06,756
It's what he imagined
our world used to be like.

256
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:08,558
He painted a mural
similar to that

257
00:16:08,597 --> 00:16:10,865
on a building near here...

258
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,509
traded a good pair of boots
for the paint he needed.

259
00:16:13,642 --> 00:16:16,810
He wanted to show people
the way things were...

260
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,758
thought it might give them
something to work toward.

261
00:16:21,998 --> 00:16:25,234
Well, maybe later,
you can take us to see it.

262
00:16:25,273 --> 00:16:26,868
All right.

263
00:16:28,481 --> 00:16:32,287
Well, it looks like we
have ourselves a clinic.

264
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,230
The first thing I have to do
is run a complete

265
00:16:35,265 --> 00:16:38,239
bio-spectral analysis
on an asymptomatic individual.

266
00:16:39,944 --> 00:16:41,379
Loosely translated

267
00:16:41,415 --> 00:16:43,249
that means he needs a volunteer.

268
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,190
Great.

269
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,030
Now, if you'll just have a seat

270
00:16:49,068 --> 00:16:51,370
the doctor will be
with you in a moment.

271
00:16:54,816 --> 00:16:57,345
They love to keep you waiting.

272
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:00,295
It, uh, makes them
feel important.

273
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,825
How would you like to see
a picture of your baby?

274
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:53,424
There it is.

275
00:17:53,468 --> 00:17:55,702
Let me see.

276
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,836
Wh-What's happened?

277
00:17:57,913 --> 00:18:00,077
We've isolated the virus.

278
00:18:00,118 --> 00:18:02,214
Is that a good thing?

279
00:18:02,258 --> 00:18:03,625
It means we can start analyzing

280
00:18:03,661 --> 00:18:05,895
its molecular structure...
look for binding sites

281
00:18:05,934 --> 00:18:07,632
so we can tailor an antigen.

282
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,437
In other words, yes.

283
00:18:09,476 --> 00:18:11,002
It's a very good thing.

284
00:18:12,651 --> 00:18:15,146
I'm going to start
mapping nucleotides.

285
00:18:15,192 --> 00:18:17,356
Can you run a protein sequencer?

286
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:18,730
I think so.

287
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,175
I... I hope you two are hungry.

288
00:18:25,218 --> 00:18:27,018
Starving.

289
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:28,615
Good.

290
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,688
That looks like a feast.

291
00:18:30,731 --> 00:18:32,200
It was supposed to be.

292
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,139
What do you mean?

293
00:18:35,444 --> 00:18:37,039
Nothing.

294
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,450
Do you like Takana root tea?

295
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,805
Ekoria...

296
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:50,508
where did you get all this food?

297
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,352
I've been saving it
for the hospital...

298
00:18:53,391 --> 00:18:54,917
for my death.

299
00:18:54,995 --> 00:18:56,863
But something tells me

300
00:18:56,899 --> 00:18:59,303
I'm not going to need it
anymore.

301
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:05,919
Well, thanks anyway.

302
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:08,356
She's not interested either.

303
00:19:08,396 --> 00:19:09,888
I hope Dax
is having better luck.

304
00:19:09,933 --> 00:19:11,801
I don't understand
why you need people

305
00:19:11,838 --> 00:19:13,433
who've quickened
to make your cure.

306
00:19:13,476 --> 00:19:15,606
Well, I need to chart
the progress of the viral...

307
00:19:15,648 --> 00:19:17,812
I'm sorry.

308
00:19:17,854 --> 00:19:19,380
Oh, you're still here.

309
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:20,894
Yes.

310
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:23,401
Well, I see the blight
has spared you.

311
00:19:23,436 --> 00:19:26,102
Maybe it doesn't like
the taste of your blood.

312
00:19:26,142 --> 00:19:29,514
Unfortunately,
it seems to like yours.

313
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:30,918
Well, I'd invite you to my death

314
00:19:30,955 --> 00:19:32,653
but we don't know
each other that well.

315
00:19:32,692 --> 00:19:34,960
What if I told you
there was a chance

316
00:19:34,998 --> 00:19:36,467
you didn't have to die?

317
00:19:37,772 --> 00:19:39,071
I'm a doctor.

318
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,407
Don't tell me...
you have a cure.

319
00:19:42,451 --> 00:19:43,681
I'm working on one.

320
00:19:43,721 --> 00:19:44,985
Yeah, what'll it cost me?

321
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:46,219
A good coat?

322
00:19:46,261 --> 00:19:47,594
A tilo of oil?

323
00:19:47,631 --> 00:19:50,365
It won't cost you anything.

324
00:19:50,405 --> 00:19:52,308
He can help us.

325
00:19:52,344 --> 00:19:54,212
Listen to him.

326
00:19:54,249 --> 00:19:58,123
I need volunteers,
people who have quickened.

327
00:19:58,159 --> 00:19:59,823
What will you do?

328
00:19:59,863 --> 00:20:00,832
See how loud we scream

329
00:20:00,865 --> 00:20:02,266
when the blight
burns through us?

330
00:20:03,338 --> 00:20:05,434
I have medicines
that can dull the pain.

331
00:20:05,478 --> 00:20:08,509
I have equipment unlike
anything on your world.

332
00:20:08,553 --> 00:20:11,425
How would you like me
to fix that arm

333
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:14,695
so you can play with
your friends over there?

334
00:20:16,139 --> 00:20:18,475
I'm not going to hurt you.

335
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,570
Well, you have a fracture
right here.

336
00:20:29,607 --> 00:20:31,601
I bet it hurts.

337
00:20:47,286 --> 00:20:49,280
Better?

338
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:54,727
Did you see that?

339
00:20:56,376 --> 00:20:58,108
How did you do that?

340
00:20:58,148 --> 00:20:59,743
Does it matter?

341
00:20:59,785 --> 00:21:02,623
He can find a cure for us

342
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:04,151
if we help him.

343
00:21:07,171 --> 00:21:09,439
Fixing a broken bone
and curing the blight

344
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:10,878
are two different things.

345
00:21:10,914 --> 00:21:12,851
I know that.

346
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:17,892
Others have come here
with promises of a cure.

347
00:21:17,932 --> 00:21:21,396
They stirred up hope,
took food and clothing

348
00:21:21,441 --> 00:21:23,743
in exchange for their elixirs

349
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:26,846
but their promises
were always lies.

350
00:21:29,061 --> 00:21:30,656
And all those who believed them

351
00:21:30,699 --> 00:21:33,069
came to me in the end,
begging for release.

352
00:21:34,977 --> 00:21:37,506
I just want to do
what I can to help.

353
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,544
I'm not making any promises.

354
00:21:39,588 --> 00:21:41,787
Take care that you don't.

355
00:21:41,828 --> 00:21:43,890
Because we have
dealt with people

356
00:21:43,933 --> 00:21:45,665
who give false hope before.

357
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,233
Believe me...
their deaths make the blight

358
00:21:48,344 --> 00:21:49,745
look like a blessing.

359
00:22:12,474 --> 00:22:14,034
What's wrong?

360
00:22:14,078 --> 00:22:18,077
Oh, I've been trying to chart
the life cycle of the virus.

361
00:22:18,122 --> 00:22:21,962
It would be a lot easier if
I'd gotten more tissue samples.

362
00:22:23,001 --> 00:22:25,473
Maybe you should go home.

363
00:22:25,507 --> 00:22:28,538
Maybe my people
don't deserve your help.

364
00:22:28,582 --> 00:22:31,681
Oh, they've just
been suffering so long

365
00:22:31,723 --> 00:22:34,218
they've lost hope
that things can be better.

366
00:22:34,263 --> 00:22:35,927
It's more than that.

367
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:38,770
We've come to worship death.

368
00:22:42,886 --> 00:22:46,292
I used to wake up
and look at myself in the mirror

369
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:49,827
and be disappointed
I hadn't quickened in my sleep.

370
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,206
Going to Trevean
seemed so much easier

371
00:22:52,243 --> 00:22:54,009
than going on living.

372
00:22:54,048 --> 00:22:56,418
Yet, you don't feel
that way anymore.

373
00:22:58,326 --> 00:23:00,229
Not since the baby.

374
00:23:02,971 --> 00:23:04,999
My little boy.

375
00:23:07,182 --> 00:23:08,583
Can your machines tell me

376
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:11,217
what he's going to look like
when he grows up?

377
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:13,253
Oh, no.

378
00:23:13,298 --> 00:23:15,098
Not really.

379
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:20,014
Maybe he'll look
like his father.

380
00:23:22,221 --> 00:23:24,192
I...

381
00:23:24,226 --> 00:23:27,200
I want to be here for him...

382
00:23:27,234 --> 00:23:30,801
to hold his hand
when he takes his first step

383
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:34,148
kiss his knee
when he scrapes it in a fall.

384
00:23:34,186 --> 00:23:38,357
Well, with any luck, you'll see
him have children of his own.

385
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,267
Julian?

386
00:23:42,474 --> 00:23:44,570
There's some people here
who'd like to see you.

387
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:54,879
I suppose you're
going to want to bleed me.

388
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,080
Oh, um...

389
00:23:59,122 --> 00:24:00,489
a little.

390
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:06,503
I canceled my death for you.

391
00:24:09,817 --> 00:24:12,415
I was really looking forward
to it.

392
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,029
All right.

393
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,437
Everybody gets three milligrams

394
00:24:31,473 --> 00:24:33,501
including you.

395
00:24:39,594 --> 00:24:40,927
Perfect.

396
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:52,987
There.
This'll dull the pain.

397
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,399
I like your spots.

398
00:24:58,443 --> 00:25:01,143
You told me that yesterday.

399
00:25:02,487 --> 00:25:03,979
I still like them.

400
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:13,040
Julian.

401
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,918
Epran has stopped responding
to the cordrazine.

402
00:25:18,962 --> 00:25:21,126
I had to put him
in an inhibitor field.

403
00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:23,037
He's further along
than everyone else.

404
00:25:23,073 --> 00:25:24,133
I'm hoping he'll be

405
00:25:24,177 --> 00:25:26,171
the first to respond
to the antigen.

406
00:25:26,215 --> 00:25:28,379
Think of it.

407
00:25:28,421 --> 00:25:31,520
She may well be holding
the cure in her hands.

408
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:35,061
Do you think we should tell
her what she's giving them?

409
00:25:35,104 --> 00:25:37,736
She's nervous enough
about using the hypo.

410
00:25:37,779 --> 00:25:40,844
It's better if we wait
till we're positive.

411
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,386
I suppose.

412
00:25:44,629 --> 00:25:46,657
You should take a break.

413
00:25:46,702 --> 00:25:49,402
You've been working
nonstop for days.

414
00:26:13,938 --> 00:26:14,907
Doctor?

415
00:26:14,941 --> 00:26:16,137
Oh...

416
00:26:16,178 --> 00:26:17,808
Dax wanted me to tell you

417
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:20,253
that Epran's white blood count
is up another 12 percent.

418
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,689
That's great news.

419
00:26:21,726 --> 00:26:22,752
It is?

420
00:26:22,795 --> 00:26:23,991
Trust me.

421
00:26:24,031 --> 00:26:25,227
I do.

422
00:26:25,268 --> 00:26:26,760
I did from the start.

423
00:26:26,806 --> 00:26:28,777
I don't... really know why.

424
00:26:28,811 --> 00:26:31,613
Well, I'd like to think
it's my bedside manner.

425
00:26:31,652 --> 00:26:32,848
Hmm?

426
00:26:32,888 --> 00:26:34,448
Um...

427
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:35,984
doctors and nurses

428
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:39,061
are supposed to project
an air of caring competence.

429
00:26:39,138 --> 00:26:41,166
You were doing it in there.

430
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,908
Me?

431
00:26:42,948 --> 00:26:44,417
I was watching you.

432
00:26:44,451 --> 00:26:46,422
You're very good with patients.

433
00:26:46,456 --> 00:26:48,484
Oh, I was just trying
to be kind.

434
00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:50,899
Well, some people don't like
to be around the sick.

435
00:26:50,934 --> 00:26:52,928
It reminds them
of their own mortality.

436
00:26:52,974 --> 00:26:55,503
It doesn't bother you?

437
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,211
Sometimes.

438
00:26:57,251 --> 00:27:00,886
I prefer to confront mortality
rather than hide from it.

439
00:27:00,927 --> 00:27:02,898
When you make someone well

440
00:27:02,933 --> 00:27:05,839
it's like
you're chasing death off...

441
00:27:05,873 --> 00:27:08,539
making him wait for another day.

442
00:27:08,581 --> 00:27:10,883
But death comes
to everyone eventually.

443
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,290
Except Kukalaka.

444
00:27:13,326 --> 00:27:16,026
Kuka... who?

445
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:17,662
My first patient.

446
00:27:17,704 --> 00:27:19,334
A teddy bear.

447
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:20,708
What's that?

448
00:27:22,082 --> 00:27:24,577
Oh, it's a sort of, um...

449
00:27:24,622 --> 00:27:27,528
soft puppet.

450
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,295
Anyway, when I was a little boy

451
00:27:29,335 --> 00:27:30,965
I took him everywhere I went

452
00:27:31,005 --> 00:27:34,970
and after a few years,
he became a little threadbare

453
00:27:35,016 --> 00:27:37,146
until eventually his leg tore

454
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:38,953
and some of the stuffing
fell out.

455
00:27:38,993 --> 00:27:40,519
My mother was all set
to throw him out

456
00:27:40,564 --> 00:27:42,900
but I wouldn't have it because
at the tender age of five

457
00:27:42,936 --> 00:27:45,100
I performed my first surgery.

458
00:27:45,142 --> 00:27:48,378
I restuffed him
and sewed his leg closed.

459
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,789
From that day on,
I did everything I could

460
00:27:51,826 --> 00:27:53,797
to keep Kukalaka in one piece.

461
00:27:53,831 --> 00:27:56,862
You know, I must have
sewn and stitched

462
00:27:56,906 --> 00:28:00,142
and repatched every square inch
of that bear.

463
00:28:00,181 --> 00:28:02,619
Why were you so determined
to keep him together?

464
00:28:02,654 --> 00:28:04,956
Well, I wouldn't be
much of a doctor

465
00:28:04,994 --> 00:28:07,592
if I gave up on a patient,
would I?

466
00:28:09,706 --> 00:28:12,178
Where's Kukalaka now?

467
00:28:12,245 --> 00:28:14,045
Oh, in a closet somewhere.

468
00:28:18,562 --> 00:28:20,966
On a shelf...

469
00:28:21,002 --> 00:28:22,528
in my room.

470
00:28:25,113 --> 00:28:27,779
Julian, something's wrong.

471
00:28:43,961 --> 00:28:45,123
Julian.

472
00:28:46,702 --> 00:28:50,200
Something's causing the virus
to mutate.

473
00:28:50,244 --> 00:28:52,272
Could it be a reaction
to the antigen?

474
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:53,546
I don't see how.

475
00:28:53,586 --> 00:28:56,560
I need a microcellular
scanner.

476
00:28:56,594 --> 00:28:58,428
Help me, Bashir!

477
00:28:58,466 --> 00:28:59,628
He's going to take care of you.

478
00:28:59,669 --> 00:29:02,335
You're going to be all right.
Okay.

479
00:29:07,757 --> 00:29:09,226
My God!

480
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,494
It's the EM fields
from our instruments!

481
00:29:14,173 --> 00:29:17,045
Shut everything down!
Now!

482
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:25,902
All right, everything's off.

483
00:29:27,174 --> 00:29:29,111
The mutation rate hasn't slowed.

484
00:29:29,145 --> 00:29:31,082
The effect must be cumulative.

485
00:29:32,822 --> 00:29:35,728
Give everybody four milligrams
of cordrazine.

486
00:29:50,334 --> 00:29:52,362
His heart stopped.

487
00:29:52,405 --> 00:29:53,635
His heart stopped!

488
00:30:01,195 --> 00:30:02,664
Come on.

489
00:30:02,699 --> 00:30:05,696
Breathe.
Breathe.

490
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,982
Breathe.

491
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:12,821
Julian.

492
00:30:14,296 --> 00:30:15,287
Julian!

493
00:30:15,332 --> 00:30:16,699
Breathe!

494
00:30:16,735 --> 00:30:18,501
Doctor!

495
00:30:26,394 --> 00:30:27,989
What have you done?

496
00:30:28,934 --> 00:30:29,925
Help me!

497
00:30:38,292 --> 00:30:39,761
Trevean, please!

498
00:30:39,795 --> 00:30:41,025
Get out of my way.

499
00:30:41,065 --> 00:30:42,398
Trevean!

500
00:30:42,435 --> 00:30:43,927
She's asking for me.

501
00:30:43,973 --> 00:30:45,944
You have no right to interfere.

502
00:30:52,061 --> 00:30:53,553
Thank you.

503
00:31:03,992 --> 00:31:07,330
- Trevean!
- Trevean.

504
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:09,167
Trevean, help me.

505
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:12,346
- Trevean!
- Trevean!

506
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,747
Help me please!

507
00:31:26,121 --> 00:31:31,066
I remember running an hematology
scan on Epran the other day.

508
00:31:40,325 --> 00:31:41,794
There were changes...

509
00:31:41,829 --> 00:31:45,099
in the viral base-pair
sequence...

510
00:31:49,482 --> 00:31:51,750
and I didn't know why.

511
00:31:53,158 --> 00:31:54,822
There's no way
you could have known

512
00:31:54,863 --> 00:31:56,993
it was because
of our instruments.

513
00:31:57,034 --> 00:32:00,133
I should have put it together.

514
00:32:00,176 --> 00:32:02,478
That's not fair.

515
00:32:02,516 --> 00:32:04,008
Isn't it?

516
00:32:05,992 --> 00:32:09,057
I'm going to tell you
a little secret, Jadzia.

517
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,972
I was looking forward
to tomorrow...

518
00:32:12,073 --> 00:32:15,343
to seeing Kira again
and casually asking

519
00:32:15,383 --> 00:32:17,354
"How was the nebula?

520
00:32:17,388 --> 00:32:18,687
"And, oh, by the way

521
00:32:18,724 --> 00:32:21,857
I cured that blight thing
those people had."

522
00:32:23,369 --> 00:32:27,106
It's not a crime to believe
in yourself, Julian.

523
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:29,014
These people believed in me

524
00:32:29,085 --> 00:32:31,181
and look where it got them.

525
00:32:34,532 --> 00:32:36,594
Trevean was right.

526
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:38,609
There is no cure.

527
00:32:38,643 --> 00:32:41,481
The Dominion made sure of that.

528
00:32:41,516 --> 00:32:42,985
And I was so arrogant

529
00:32:43,021 --> 00:32:45,185
I thought I could
find one in a week.

530
00:32:52,479 --> 00:32:54,951
Maybe it was arrogant
to think that

531
00:32:54,985 --> 00:32:58,893
but it's even more arrogant
to think there isn't a cure

532
00:32:58,929 --> 00:33:02,131
just because you
couldn't find it.

533
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:40,027
I'm glad you got a chance
to see it before you left.

534
00:33:42,876 --> 00:33:44,779
Ekoria.

535
00:33:47,889 --> 00:33:51,022
I thought I'd make it.

536
00:33:51,065 --> 00:33:52,557
I really did.

537
00:33:52,601 --> 00:33:54,401
I'm sorry.

538
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,500
Don't be.

539
00:33:55,543 --> 00:33:57,981
You gave me hope.

540
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:01,047
I haven't felt that
since before my husband died.

541
00:34:07,072 --> 00:34:08,405
Good-bye.

542
00:34:09,913 --> 00:34:11,007
Ekoria...

543
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,382
wait.

544
00:34:18,101 --> 00:34:19,661
You're sure about this?

545
00:34:19,705 --> 00:34:22,543
I can't leave these people.

546
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:24,014
Not now.

547
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:27,589
Whenever you're ready,
contact the station.

548
00:34:27,626 --> 00:34:29,460
We'll have a runabout here
within days.

549
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:35,546
You know what worries me,
Julian?

550
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,549
Is that without me

551
00:34:36,582 --> 00:34:38,314
you won't have anyone
to translate for you.

552
00:34:42,731 --> 00:34:43,995
Good luck.

553
00:34:45,573 --> 00:34:47,441
Major?

554
00:35:32,761 --> 00:35:34,253
What is it?

555
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:38,938
There isn't a trace
of the antigen I gave you

556
00:35:38,977 --> 00:35:40,446
in your bloodstream.

557
00:35:40,481 --> 00:35:42,919
Your immune system
must have rejected it.

558
00:35:45,027 --> 00:35:46,053
Oh...

559
00:35:48,435 --> 00:35:49,461
Is it bad?

560
00:35:49,505 --> 00:35:51,499
Mm-hmm...

561
00:35:53,615 --> 00:35:55,016
I can give you another hypo

562
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:57,855
but you have so much cordrazine
in your system already

563
00:35:57,893 --> 00:36:00,127
it might be hard
on the baby's metabolism.

564
00:36:03,274 --> 00:36:04,504
I'll wait.

565
00:36:29,241 --> 00:36:31,235
What is that smell?

566
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:33,945
I'm making a salve.

567
00:36:33,987 --> 00:36:36,425
Long as I don't
have to drink it.

568
00:36:39,802 --> 00:36:41,636
How do you feel?

569
00:36:41,673 --> 00:36:43,337
I've been better.

570
00:36:43,378 --> 00:36:44,608
Can you sit up?

571
00:36:50,663 --> 00:36:51,859
Breathe.

572
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:57,875
Again?

573
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:05,761
Let's see how the baby's doing.

574
00:37:16,965 --> 00:37:18,595
His head's over here now.

575
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,128
I'm not surprised.

576
00:37:20,174 --> 00:37:23,911
Feels like he's
turning somersaults in there.

577
00:37:33,742 --> 00:37:36,271
His heart's getting stronger
every day.

578
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,390
I'd say another six weeks.

579
00:37:42,866 --> 00:37:45,704
I'll never make it that long.

580
00:37:47,077 --> 00:37:49,447
Well, I can induce
labor in two weeks.

581
00:37:49,482 --> 00:37:52,854
The baby'll be old enough
by then.

582
00:37:55,765 --> 00:37:58,033
Two weeks.

583
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,002
Trevean...

584
00:38:27,046 --> 00:38:29,678
am I dead?

585
00:38:29,721 --> 00:38:31,247
Is that what you want?

586
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:33,559
I can end your suffering.

587
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:40,411
Your child will have known
nothing but peace.

588
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:46,923
No.

589
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:51,034
He deserves a chance to live.

590
00:38:51,076 --> 00:38:53,378
The blight will take him
in the end.

591
00:38:55,253 --> 00:38:56,779
Trevean...

592
00:38:58,596 --> 00:39:01,729
I didn't realize
you made house calls.

593
00:39:07,953 --> 00:39:10,772
I was concerned that she might
be too weak to come to me.

594
00:39:12,776 --> 00:39:14,804
I don't understand...

595
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:17,515
why you're so
obsessed with death.

596
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:19,024
From what I've heard

597
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:22,157
you've lived with the blight
longer than anyone.

598
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,864
Yes...

599
00:39:23,905 --> 00:39:26,605
and I've seen more
suffering than anyone.

600
00:39:29,653 --> 00:39:31,749
Good-bye, Ekoria.

601
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:35,233
I hope you live long enough
to see your baby.

602
00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:50,803
Trevean means well.

603
00:39:50,841 --> 00:39:54,944
He's a kind man in his own way.

604
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,156
Push!

605
00:40:12,197 --> 00:40:14,065
Good. Good.
Now breathe.

606
00:40:14,102 --> 00:40:15,571
Don't stop breathing.

607
00:40:15,606 --> 00:40:17,041
Don't stop. Breathe.

608
00:40:17,076 --> 00:40:18,306
I can see his head.

609
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:22,111
And push!

610
00:40:26,234 --> 00:40:27,932
Push!

611
00:40:31,815 --> 00:40:33,375
Yes, push!

612
00:40:36,326 --> 00:40:38,560
Yes! Yes.

613
00:40:50,262 --> 00:40:52,256
My God.

614
00:40:52,334 --> 00:40:55,399
That's why there's no antigen
in your system.

615
00:40:57,114 --> 00:41:00,316
It's all been absorbed
through the placenta.

616
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,728
Ekoria...

617
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:09,135
he doesn't have any lesions.

618
00:41:09,178 --> 00:41:11,810
He doesn't have the blight.

619
00:41:54,161 --> 00:41:55,630
You found a cure.

620
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:56,760
It's not a cure.

621
00:41:56,801 --> 00:41:58,100
It's a vaccine.

622
00:41:58,139 --> 00:41:59,369
Every pregnant woman

623
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:02,108
should be inoculated with
it as soon as possible.

624
00:42:02,149 --> 00:42:03,311
It won't help them

625
00:42:03,352 --> 00:42:05,084
but it will protect
their babies.

626
00:42:05,124 --> 00:42:07,220
Our children
won't have the blight?

627
00:42:07,262 --> 00:42:09,564
The vaccine isn't
difficult to make

628
00:42:09,602 --> 00:42:13,237
but seeing that everybody
gets it will be a huge task.

629
00:42:13,278 --> 00:42:16,184
Oh, not a task...

630
00:42:16,218 --> 00:42:17,551
a privilege.

631
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:20,789
Can you show me how to make it?

632
00:42:20,831 --> 00:42:24,067
I was hoping you'd ask that.

633
00:43:12,398 --> 00:43:15,132
Nucleotide sequencing complete.

634
00:43:15,172 --> 00:43:17,109
Viral reproduction normal.

635
00:43:18,714 --> 00:43:23,557
Let's try an A-to-C
base-pair reshuffling.

636
00:43:23,594 --> 00:43:24,756
Doctor...

637
00:43:26,768 --> 00:43:28,830
I read your report.

638
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:30,778
Good work.

639
00:43:30,813 --> 00:43:32,579
Thank you, sir.

640
00:43:32,618 --> 00:43:36,253
Nucleotide sequencing complete.
Viral reproduction normal.

641
00:43:41,206 --> 00:43:43,336
People are still dying
back there.

642
00:43:43,379 --> 00:43:45,407
Yes.

643
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:47,512
But their children won't.

644
00:43:47,622 --> 00:43:50,528
That's what I keep
telling myself, sir.

645
00:43:58,351 --> 00:44:00,585
Initiate reshuffling sequence.
