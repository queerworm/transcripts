00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:07,799
SISKO:<i> Station Log, Stardate 47182.1.</i>
<i>DS9 has been temporarily evacuated</i>

2
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:11,428
<i>due to a violent plasma disruption.</i>
<i>Until the disturbance ends,</i>

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:14,389
<i>we'll be forced to maintain the station</i>
<i>with a skeleton crew.</i>

4
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:17,350
-How are we holding up?
-So far, so good.

5
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,145
I'll say one thing for the Cardassians,
they built this place to last.

6
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:21,479
Just in case it doesn't...

7
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:25,191
I've got the <i>Orinoco</i>
prepped and ready at Pad C.

8
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,609
Any word from Chief O'Brien?

9
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,236
He and Odo checked in about an hour ago.

10
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:30,697
They sealed off the airlocks
in the upper and lower pylons

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,449
and were moving on to the docking ring.

12
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,243
-Sisko to O'Brien.
<i>-O'Brien here.</i>

13
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:38,288
-What's your status, Chief?
-Almost done, Commander.

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,125
We've sealed all the airlocks
on levels 21, 22, and 23.

15
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,461
We still have to check the outer bulkheads

16
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,755
to make sure there hasn't been
any crystallization

17
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:48,965
<i>from the plasma discharges.</i>
<i>It shouldn't take too long.</i>

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,258
O'Brien out.

19
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,762
( faint banging )

20
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,598
Did you hear that?

21
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,224
Hear what?

22
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,393
I could have sworn I heard something.

23
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,608
-Quark!
-What are you doing here?

24
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,527
ODO: You're under strict orders from Sisko
to stay in the bar.

25
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,448
I'm not a prisoner, Odo.
I volunteered to stay

26
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,033
and help you protect the station.

27
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:18,244
The only reason you volunteered
is because there wasn't enough room

28
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:22,415
on the evacuation shuttles
for 600 bars of gold-pressed latinum

29
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,083
which still doesn't explain

30
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,711
what you're doing out here
in the docking ring.

31
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,049
I was saying good-bye to my brother.

32
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:35,220
Your brother?
His shuttle left three hours ago.

33
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:40,600
Funny... it's only been three hours
and I'm already lost without him.

34
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,560
Oh, please!

35
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,604
Don't try to tell me
you've been sitting out here

36
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,940
all this time pining for Rom.

37
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,650
I know, I know.

38
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,153
He couldn't find a cup of water
if you dropped him in a lake,

39
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:56,783
but even if he is an idiot,
he's still my brother.

40
00:01:57,158 --> 00:02:00,870
And you'd betray him in a second
if it suited your interests.

41
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,540
That doesn't mean I don't love him.

42
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,541
( Odo scoffs )

43
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:09,879
-Chief, do you have any brothers?
-As a matter of fact, I have two.

44
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,757
And did you ever have
to say good-bye to them?

45
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:16,553
-Sure, when I joined Starfleet.
-And did it bring a tear to your eye?

46
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,722
I suppose so.

47
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,601
Well, try explaining that to him.

48
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,069
{\an8}The storm's intensity is up 37%.

49
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,029
{\an8}Is there any way of telling
how long it'll last?

50
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,783
{\an8}Your guess is as good as mine.
Plasma storms are extremely rare.

51
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,618
{\an8}But look on the bright side.

52
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,578
{\an8}This gives us a great
opportunity to study one.

53
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,705
{\an8}Oh, lucky us.

54
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,623
{\an8}You should see the view
from the Promenade.

55
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,958
{\an8}It's simply amazing.

56
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,253
{\an8}-I assume the Promenade is secure.
-Oh, yes, sir. I've struck the sails

57
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:56,963
{\an8}and battened the hatches, so to speak.

58
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,465
{\an8}DAX: Benjamin,
you better take a look at this.

59
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,635
{\an8}( console beeping insistently )

60
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:07,015
{\an8}I'm detecting a small vessel
headed this way at one quarter impulse.

61
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,143
{\an8}-KIRA: They're hailing us.
-On screen.

62
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,688
{\an8}I can't get a visual.

63
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,232
{\an8}MAN: ( static )
<i>This is the Cargo Ship </i>Ekina.

64
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,234
{\an8}<i>We've been caught by the storm.</i>

65
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,112
{\an8}<i>Our engines have been severely damaged.</i>

66
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,699
{\an8}<i>We need emergency assistance.</i>
<i>Can you read me?</i>

67
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,327
{\an8}<i>Repeat, this is the Cargo Ship </i>Ekina<i>...</i>

68
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,079
I've lost it.

69
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,249
Can we get a transporter lock on the crew?

70
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,794
No, there's too much interference.

71
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,548
Engage the tractor beam.
Bring them in to the closest docking bay.

72
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,759
There might be casualties.
I'll get down to the Infirmary.

73
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:43,801
SISKO: Good idea.

74
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:47,346
-Sisko to O'Brien.
<i>-</i>O'Brien here.

75
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,808
<i>Chief, we've got some storm victims</i>
<i>coming in to Docking Bay Five</i>

76
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,226
<i>who may be in need of assistance.</i>

77
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,395
I'll have to release the emergency seal

78
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,230
on the airlock before
they can board the station.

79
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,231
On my way.

80
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,119
Stand clear.

81
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,792
( coughing )

82
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,211
Are you all right? Is anyone hurt?

83
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:19,545
KLINGON: Not yet.

84
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,715
-What the hell do you think you're doing?
-No questions.

85
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:26,219
This is a nice way to show your gratitude.
We just saved your lives out there.

86
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:29,889
You see? The ever-helpful Federation.

87
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,725
-So predictable.
-Listen, friend

88
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,143
in case you haven't heard

89
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,813
the Federation and the Klingon
Empire are allies now.

90
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:37,814
( spits )

91
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,524
The Empire is governed

92
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,777
by doddering fools
and frightened old women

93
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,530
who aren't worthy of the name "Klingon."

94
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,407
Mareel! The combadge.

95
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,039
-This one must be the shape-shifter.
-Go on! What are you waiting for?

96
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,756
You're a Trill.

97
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,304
You! Shifter! Inside.

98
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,891
And what if I refuse?

99
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,229
Please, do as he says
and no one will get hurt.

100
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:22,525
KLINGON: Now! Or this one dies.

101
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,300
Let's go...

102
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,801
Ally.

103
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,893
Chief, were there any casualties?

104
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,479
-That depends on you.
-BASHIR: What's this all about?

105
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,438
( grunts )

106
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,440
Yeto, get the Ferengi.

107
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,985
-Any more questions?
-Don't hurt him.

108
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,863
Mareel! The box.

109
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:15,620
Put it in your stasis chamber.
Now, or I will destroy it.

110
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,039
Is that supposed
to be some kind of threat?

111
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,041
They've got Odo in there.

112
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,922
I see... Well, in that case...

113
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,563
I'm still not getting a response
from O'Brien or Odo.

114
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,440
Run a level-3 security scan.

115
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,359
KLINGON: Don't bother.

116
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,907
Please, take your hands
away from the controls.

117
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,451
Now!

118
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,871
Get to the center of the room.

119
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:03,960
Do as he says.

120
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,095
Don't worry, Verad.
It's going to be all right.

121
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,573
Get with the others. Move!

122
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,160
Your turn, little man.

123
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,378
Don't forget to disable the backups
as well as the primary systems.

124
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,261
It's my fault, Commander.
They caught us by surprise.

125
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:59,181
Somehow, they must have neutralized
the security systems

126
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,392
-in the docking ring.
-How did they manage that?

127
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,061
I'm not sure but I've got
a pretty good idea.

128
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,732
We ran across Quark
in an airlock a little while ago.

129
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:12,028
When this is over Quark
and I are going to have a little talk.

130
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,246
Do you know him?

131
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,679
Ah, Yeto.

132
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,308
It's such a pleasure
doing business with Klingons.

133
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,519
You're so, um... punctual.

134
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,815
I see your ship was rescued
according to plan.

135
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,818
Um, I've got your merchandise right here

136
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,113
-but I don't see any latinum.
-You Ferengi!

137
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,909
You think you're so clever,
but you're stupid.

138
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,620
Now, now, there's no need
for name-calling.

139
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,956
If you don't want
these liquid data chains,

140
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,834
I'm sure I can line up
dozens of other buyers.

141
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,169
Go right ahead.

142
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,213
Yeto,

143
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,882
you expect me to believe
that you've come all this way,

144
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:19,387
braved the storm, just to tell me
that the deal is off?

145
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,013
Stupid Ferengi!

146
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:22,848
( chuckling nervously )

147
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:28,104
-I said no one moves.
-I'm Commander of this station.

148
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,524
-What is your business here?
-You'll have to ask my employer.

149
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:42,493
I'm... I'm sorry about all this.
If everyone would just cooperate

150
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:46,330
-I promise it will all be over soon.
-What will be over soon?

151
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,834
QUARK: This is an outrage!
I demand to be released at once!

152
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,919
-Enough of your whining!
-Who are these people?

153
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,087
What do they want from us?

154
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,798
Funny. I was about
to ask you that question.

155
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,633
-That's enough.
-SISKO: I agree.

156
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:58,968
Now tell me what you want here.

157
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:03,472
Dax.

158
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,601
I... want Dax.

159
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:13,441
-She's not going anywhere with you.
-No, no. I don't want the girl.

160
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:19,572
I only want what is rightfully mine...
What should have been mine years ago.

161
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,536
I want Dax.

162
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:31,417
DAX: The symbiont, Benjamin.
He's come to steal my symbiont.

163
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:45,848
You can't remove Jadzia's symbiont.
If you do, she'll die.

164
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,142
He knows that, Doctor.

165
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:49,643
I'm...

166
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:55,232
I'm sorry about all this.
Please, believe me,

167
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:59,236
-I wish I didn't have to do this.
-Then don't.

168
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,031
I don't have a choice.

169
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:08,329
I... spent my whole life
trying to qualify for the joining.

170
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:14,627
I... studied constantly,
every day, every waking hour.

171
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,465
I sacrificed... everything,

172
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,511
and then I went before
the symbiosis evaluation board

173
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,428
And...

174
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:31,227
They reduced my entire life to one word...

175
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,438
Unsuitable.

176
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,483
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

177
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:41,403
Neither of my parents
or my sister underwent symbiosis,

178
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,323
and they live happy
and productive lives.

179
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,618
Only one Trill in ten
is chosen to be joined.

180
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,412
That's easy for you to say.
They chose you.

181
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,790
I was one of the lucky ones.

182
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,917
Now it's Verad's time to be lucky.

183
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,752
KIRA: Why Dax?

184
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,256
There are thousands
of symbionts on Trill. Why her?

185
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,508
I did research. I worked it all out.

186
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,970
The Dax symbiont is the best match for me.

187
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:09,014
We have mutual interests,
science, diplomacy--

188
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,768
Verad, there is another reason,
isn't there?

189
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,478
SISKO: The wormhole.

190
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,356
After you've stolen the symbiont

191
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,775
you plan on escaping
to the Gamma Quadrant, don't you?

192
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,319
Can you think of a better place
to start a new life?

193
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:26,407
I understand your frustration
but there could be dozens of reasons

194
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,742
why the board
didn't select you for symbiosis.

195
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,953
They have to be very careful.

196
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:35,541
An improper joining
can cause permanent psychological damage

197
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,419
to both the symbiont and the host.

198
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,505
They were only looking
after your best interests.

199
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,174
Your best interests maybe, but not mine.

200
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:50,264
All they've done is condemn me
to a life of... of...

201
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,601
Mediocrity.

202
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,561
Well, I refuse to accept that.

203
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:59,189
I--I'm not going to spend
the rest of my life dreaming

204
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:03,903
about what I could have been.

205
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:10,409
What I should have been.
I deserve... more...

206
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:16,040
-and I'm going to get it.
-Yeto, T'Kar, it's time.

207
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,628
I'll have no part in this.

208
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,964
I... I understand.

209
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,633
( groans )

210
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,137
( gasping )

211
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,389
VERAD: Keep away from him, Doctor.

212
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,187
There, you see? I've taken the first step.

213
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,859
Even if I don't get what I want,
my life is over,

214
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:48,447
so either you help me
or you and your friends will die.

215
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,698
It's your choice.

216
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,326
He'll help.

217
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,996
I don't want anyone else hurt
because of me.

218
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:01,377
But you have to give me your word
that no one else on this station

219
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,628
will be harmed.

220
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,588
I... I promise.

221
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,382
Doctor.

222
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,512
Do as he says, Julian, please.

223
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,274
Let me treat
Chief O'Brien's phaser wound first.

224
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,818
BASHIR: It won't take long.

225
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,445
There's an emergency
medical kit in the console.

226
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,657
Get it!

227
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:38,998
Hold still, Chief.

228
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,794
( groaning )

229
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,092
There.

230
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,052
There should be no permanent damage.

231
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:58,517
Apply this every 20 minutes or so.
It should help the wound regenerate.

232
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,019
Enough stalling!

233
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,772
Do as he says, Doctor.
This is no time to be a hero.

234
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,899
Take them to the Infirmary.

235
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,195
This isn't over, Dax. I promise you.

236
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,405
SISKO: Dax...

237
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:15,617
DAX: I know, Benjamin.

238
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,747
You'll do everything you can.
And just in case it isn't enough,

239
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,666
I want you to know it's been fun.

240
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,712
MAREEL: Let's go.

241
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:34,511
Good luck.

242
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:41,351
It won't be long now, and then you'll see.
Everything will be just as I promised.

243
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,146
I know.

244
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,747
-What's that?
-BASHIR: It's a delta wave inducer

245
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,665
to keep you asleep during the operation.

246
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,543
It also increases
your body's natural endorphin production

247
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,254
-to help accelerate the healing process.
-I don't want it.

248
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,131
I strongly recommend that you use it.

249
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,383
The surgery
will be much easier on you if--

250
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,260
I don't want your advice.

251
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,847
I want to be awake.

252
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:23,685
Use a neuroelectrical suppresser
and set up a monitor

253
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,395
so that I can watch the procedure.

254
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,649
That way, if you run into any trouble
I can assist you.

255
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,111
Now, let's get started.

256
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,454
I'm sorry, Jadzia.

257
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:54,049
Don't blame yourself, Julian.
You did everything you could.

258
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,175
I...

259
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,013
This will help you sleep.

260
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,224
Thank you.

261
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,776
Forgive me.

262
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,744
How long can Dax survive
without the symbiont?

263
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,999
Once the symbiont is removed
the host usually dies within hours

264
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,920
but Jadzia is young and healthy.
Bashir will do what he can.

265
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:37,551
-She'll make it through the night.
-That still doesn't give us much time.

266
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,594
No talking!

267
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,595
-( groaning )
-No!

268
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,568
( hissing )

269
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,361
( loud grunting )

270
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,407
( groaning )

271
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,578
I don't want to kill you,
Commander, but I will!

272
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:45,637
This is ridiculous.

273
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,473
Don't you realize
they're going to kill us?

274
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,019
What are you people sitting around for?
Do something.

275
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,021
Do you have any suggestions?

276
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:58,400
Why should I have any suggestions?
I'm not the military mastermind.

277
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,944
-I'm just a victim of circumstances.
-Victim? Really?

278
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,531
Then maybe you'd like to tell me
how four armed terrorists

279
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,575
got by our docking ring security grid.

280
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,118
Security grid?
I don't know anything about...

281
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:11,371
Save it, Quark.
You crossed the line this time.

282
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:16,209
You sold us out
and now Dax may die because of it.

283
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,463
Well, whatever happens next,
one thing is certain you are through here.

284
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,173
( snarls )

285
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,728
-Are you all right?
-I'll live.

286
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,230
Don't try that again.
I don't want to have to hurt anyone.

287
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,483
Tell that to Jadzia.

288
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,568
That's different.

289
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:44,738
Do you really believe that?

290
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,532
You heard Verad.
They didn't leave him any other choice.

291
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:51,995
-No, that's his reason. What's yours?
-I owe him.

292
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,040
I grew up on the streets of Khefka IV.

293
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,084
I never would have made it out of there
without Verad.

294
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,336
What was he doing on Khefka IV?

295
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:03,173
He was the communications clerk
at the Federation Consulate.

296
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,926
He used to visit
the accommodation house where I worked.

297
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:08,804
I used to help him relax.

298
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,141
When he was recalled to Trill,
he asked me to go with him.

299
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,645
-We've been together ever since.
-And that's it?

300
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:21,858
He got you out of a bad situation
and now you're willing to kill for him?

301
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,443
I owe him my life.

302
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,405
If there's anything
I can do for him I'll do it.

303
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,950
Even if it means losing him?

304
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:32,953
Losing him?

305
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:38,625
After the surgery Verad
won't be just Verad anymore.

306
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:42,963
He'll be a blending of Verad, Dax,
and all the previous hosts,

307
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:47,259
their memories, their knowledge,
even their personalities.

308
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,012
Verad told me
that you'd say things like that.

309
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,598
I know he'll change.

310
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,268
He'll be smarter, more confident,

311
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,812
but in all the important ways,
he'll be the same.

312
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,356
I'm sorry,
but if he told you that, he's lying.

313
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:05,819
Once a Trill
is joined it's like a rebirth.

314
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:08,446
He'll be an entirely different person.

315
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,949
If you think
I'm going to betray Verad, you're wrong.

316
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,579
It doesn't matter
what you say. I love him,

317
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,499
and I'm going to stand
by him no matter what.

318
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:21,710
VERAD: I never doubted it.

319
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:25,797
Verad.

320
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,803
No, not just Verad.

321
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,139
I'm Verad Dax.

322
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,502
Take this.

323
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:08,256
Come on, we haven't got much time.
Just move it back and forth over the wound

324
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,175
-in slow, even strokes.
-Why bother?

325
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,302
She'll be dead in a few hours anyway.

326
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,554
Not if I have anything to do with it.
Now, help me.

327
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:15,639
Why should I?

328
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:19,392
She let herself be slaughtered
like a mindless <i>t'gla.</i>

329
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,187
If she wanted to live,
she should have fought back.

330
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,065
She did what she did
to save the rest of us.

331
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:28,485
Then she is a fool,
and she deserves her fate.

332
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,278
Now listen to me, Yeto,
or whatever your name is.

333
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,488
I don't give a damn
about your warrior ethic

334
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,656
or your Klingon philosophy.

335
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,491
This woman is dying,
and I need your help to save her.

336
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,034
Now, take this instrument.

337
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:41,122
Well... so the little human
has some spark after all.

338
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,346
( beeping erratically )

339
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,558
Come on. Come on.

340
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,897
( beeping steadies )

341
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,280
Julian.

342
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:18,702
Oh, thank God. I thought I'd lost you.

343
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,662
The symbiont.

344
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,332
It's gone.

345
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:29,379
Oh, everything went perfectly.
The operation was a complete success.

346
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,424
I feel so alone.

347
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,593
I've got you stabilized.

348
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,681
If only we could get the symbiont
back in time.

349
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,559
I'm scared, Julian.

350
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,439
You're not going to die. Do you hear me?

351
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,318
I'm not going to let you die.

352
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:56,072
( shallow breathing )
I've never felt so empty.

353
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,369
BASHIR: Just rest.

354
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:04,497
Dax?

355
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,376
That's right, Benjamin.

356
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,212
It's me.

357
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:18,219
Curzon, Tobin, Jadzia, all the others,
they're all a part of you now.

358
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:22,766
It's amazing.
So many ideas. So many memories.

359
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:26,978
Eight lifetimes of memories.
It must be incredible.

360
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,022
It's better than I ever imagined.

361
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,649
The station must look very different
to you now.

362
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:35,779
It does. I... I know this place.

363
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,325
( chuckling ) And I know you, Benjamin.

364
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:44,329
Of course you do.
Remember when we first met?

365
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,373
-Pelios Station.
-Anastasia?

366
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,708
And that trip we took
to the Cliffs of Bole?

367
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,543
( both men laughing )

368
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,630
SISKO: All the months we served
aboard the <i>Livingston.</i>

369
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,383
And Science Officer Kustanovich.
What was it?

370
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,551
Eight helpings of Andorian Redbat?

371
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,845
( laughing )

372
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:04,516
SISKO: I don't think I've ever seen
someone eat so much.

373
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,936
-Remember my wedding?
-I remember your bachelor party,

374
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,270
or some of it anyway.

375
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,234
And the time we discovered the wormhole.

376
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,486
My, my, my.

377
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,116
One of Jadzia's proudest moments.

378
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,411
And now that woman is bleeding to death
in the Infirmary.

379
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:28,832
-I'd rather not discuss that, Benjamin.
-You have to discuss it, Dax.

380
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,543
You know as well as I do
we can't let her die.

381
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:34,087
She's not going to die.
She'll live on in me.

382
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,631
Jadzia's memories will live on,

383
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:40,844
but Jadzia herself will die,
and you'll have killed her.

384
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:44,389
You think I don't know that?
I'll never be able to forget it,

385
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:49,185
but I promise you, Benjamin
I'll do all I can to make up for it.

386
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,354
I'm not going
to the Gamma Quadrant to hide.

387
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:56,484
There are entire worlds who can benefit
from my knowledge and experience.

388
00:28:56,651 --> 00:29:00,572
-I can help them, and I will.
-I have a better idea.

389
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:03,366
-VERAD: What's that?
-Help Jadzia.

390
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:08,455
Come with me down to the Infirmary.
Put the symbiont back where it belongs.

391
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,459
I can't do that, Benjamin,
even if I wanted to.

392
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:16,254
Don't you see? It's too late.
The integration is already underway.

393
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:20,258
But there's still time to stop it.
Jadzia's life can still be saved.

394
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,886
Don't listen to him.
He's just trying to confuse you.

395
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:23,803
It's all right, Mareel.

396
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:27,932
Benjamin, the symbiont is still weak
from the operation.

397
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:32,729
If we attempt another joining so soon,
it might not survive.

398
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,857
-VERAD: Are you willing to risk that?
-I am.

399
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:40,069
The question is, are you?

400
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,906
Why are you wasting your time with him?

401
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,532
Because he's my friend!

402
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,618
Now, go watch the others.

403
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,292
We are still friends, aren't we, Benjamin?

404
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:55,877
I hope so.

405
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,547
Come with me down to the Infirmary

406
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,465
and prove it.

407
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,344
I can't do that.

408
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:15,313
Then you're not the Dax that I know.
Our friendship is over.

409
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,219
-Here, drink this.
-What is it?

410
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:50,014
Senarian egg broth.
It'll keep your strength up.

411
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:54,185
All right, don't drink it.
It makes no difference to me.

412
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:55,311
Hold on.

413
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,564
Thank you.

414
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,118
He even looks different, doesn't he?

415
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:14,998
The way he stands,
the way he moves, talks.

416
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:18,668
-He's better than he was.
-I'm glad you think so.

417
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:20,461
I do.

418
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,048
Really? The way he dismissed you before?

419
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,385
-Verad never did that.
-He's under a lot of stress.

420
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,805
SISKO:<i> </i>Verad was under stress
the minute he stepped onto this station,

421
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,933
-but he never turned on you, did he?
-What's your point, Commander?

422
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,018
I think you know.

423
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,896
You're trying to turn me against Verad.

424
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:41,316
Verad no longer exists.
You know that better than I do.

425
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,776
All right, then.
Verad Dax, but it won't work.

426
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,947
-Nothing has changed between us.
-You really believe that?

427
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,240
Yes.

428
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,744
All right.

429
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:55,997
Then make me believe it.

430
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,125
Go in there and talk to him.

431
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,961
Talk to him about what?

432
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,922
I don't know. Whatever you want.

433
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:07,008
I'm sure the two of you
have a lot to say to one another.

434
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,764
-I don't want to disturb him.
-Why not?

435
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,766
Because I don't want to!

436
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,477
Well, look at him,
sitting in there all alone.

437
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,687
-He needs you.
-That's enough.

438
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,231
I don't understand
why you're being so reluctant.

439
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,651
This is the perfect time
for the two of you to get reacquainted.

440
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,236
-I said that's enough!
-VERAD: Mareel.

441
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,448
Is anything wrong?

442
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,450
No, everything's fine.

443
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,285
Good.

444
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,080
Be careful.

445
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,958
I wouldn't want anything to happen to you.

446
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,977
( grunting and groaning )

447
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,980
I got him! I got him!

448
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,232
( roaring )

449
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:05,817
Stay back.

450
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,069
( groaning )

451
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,739
Maybe we should talk about this, huh?

452
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:13,658
( grunts )

453
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:17,787
My ear.

454
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,206
( moaning )

455
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:24,544
Pathetic.

456
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:28,214
Mareel, take him to the Infirmary.

457
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,258
( moaning )

458
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,311
-( screaming )
-What is it now?

459
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,314
Please... it hurts.

460
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,859
All right. Hold on.

461
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,197
The damage
appears to be fairly superficial.

462
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,575
( whispering ) No.

463
00:33:56,492 --> 00:34:02,040
But Ferengi ears are incredibly sensitive.
So I'd better run some further tests.

464
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,332
( moaning loudly )

465
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:12,592
The storm's intensity's dropped
another 20%.

466
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,345
I know this has been
hard for you, Benjamin.

467
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:19,182
It's been hard for both of us
but it's almost over.

468
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:20,349
MAREEL: Good.

469
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,852
I'm getting tired of waiting here.

470
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:28,941
-How are you feeling?
-Better than ever, thanks to you.

471
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,111
I couldn't have done this without you.

472
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:36,365
I would have spent the rest
of my life a mediocre man

473
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,367
only dreaming about what might have been.

474
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,829
You know what you have to do.

475
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,706
You just worry about getting
through the wormhole.

476
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,292
The Klingons and I will make sure
that no one stops you.

477
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:50,004
Remember, I don't want you staying here
any longer than you have to.

478
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,340
Give me an hour,
then head for the wormhole.

479
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,758
The runabout's on Pad C.

480
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:56,052
The sooner you leave,
the sooner I can follow

481
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,012
and the sooner we'll be together.

482
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,312
It's going to be all right, isn't it?

483
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:10,316
Just wait for me at the rendezvous point.

484
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,127
( loud moaning )

485
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,963
Stop whining
or I'll put you out of your misery.

486
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,464
It's not his fault.

487
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,966
He's got a deep contusion
of the auricular lobe

488
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,592
and a possible dislocated malleus.

489
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:39,470
In a Ferengi, either condition
could be fatal.

490
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:43,307
But if you want him to stop,
give me a hand with this.

491
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,309
I'm not your nurse!

492
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:49,147
Look, let's not go through that again.
Just hold this against his ear.

493
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,232
( high-pitched whining )

494
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,027
( screams )

495
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,696
Not too hard.

496
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,116
( groaning )

497
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,576
Just another second.

498
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,205
Relax.

499
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,332
( gasps )

500
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,503
There.

501
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:17,633
Thank you, Doctor. I feel better already.

502
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,181
How is she?

503
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,308
I have her stabilized

504
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,518
but there's no telling
how much time she has left.

505
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,897
We've got to get the symbiont
back before it's too late.

506
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,649
-What are you doing?
-Odo's in here.

507
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,067
He is?

508
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,862
Yes, and we've got to get him out.

509
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,072
-Are you sure?
-Quark!

510
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,201
If only we knew the access code.

511
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,121
Allow me.

512
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,421
( beeping softly )

513
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:05,181
Ah... standard
Delgorian locking mechanism.

514
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:06,891
Sophisticated...

515
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,519
but vulnerable if you know its weaknesses.

516
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,355
Hand me that laser scalpel.

517
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:18,653
Uh-huh.

518
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:23,950
Mm-hmm.

519
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,993
( clicking )

520
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,578
( beeping )

521
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,330
( lock releases )

522
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,209
It's a gift.

523
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,338
The storm's decreased another 15%.

524
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:41,217
Excellent. That should be more than enough
to allow safe passage to the wormhole.

525
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:42,969
Verad to Yeto.

526
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,014
Verad to Yeto.

527
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,058
Yeto, report!

528
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,185
The doctor must have overpowered him.

529
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:54,438
-The doctor? Impossible.
-It's the shape-shifter.

530
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,566
He must have freed the shape-shifter.
T'Kar, get me to the ship.

531
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,987
You'd better take a hostage just in case.

532
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,196
I'll go with you.

533
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,156
VERAD: I'd love your company, Benjamin,

534
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,118
but somehow, I don't think you
have my best interests at heart.

535
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:10,121
-Kira, I hate to inconvenience you--
-That's all right.

536
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,332
If Odo's free there's no way
you're getting off this station.

537
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,046
Mareel?

538
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,424
Good luck.

539
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:26,012
Well, Benjamin, I guess this is good-bye.

540
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,098
Not many friendships
last over two lifetimes.

541
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,768
I wish we could have made it three.

542
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,146
You'll be seeing me again, Verad.

543
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,463
So...

544
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,841
Where's this rendezvous going to be?

545
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:09,764
-You don't really expect me to tell you.
-No, but I hope you like it there,

546
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:13,017
because you'll be waiting
for Verad a long time.

547
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:16,145
-How would you know?
-You told me yourself.

548
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,608
I saw the look on your face
when he asked you to wait for him.

549
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,030
The plan was, he was supposed
to get there first.

550
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,034
That he would wait for me,
not the other way around.

551
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:35,623
Well, maybe it was an honest mistake.
A slip of the tongue.

552
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,292
No. He lied to me.

553
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,588
He's never lied to me before.

554
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,674
He's not coming.

555
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,345
He doesn't need me anymore.

556
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,181
No, you're wrong.

557
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,352
He does need you now, more than ever.

558
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,439
You never give up, do you?

559
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:06,112
-I told you, I'm not going to betray him.
-I'm not asking you to.

560
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:09,365
I'm asking you to save him,
to help us save him.

561
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,367
All you care about is Jadzia.

562
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,787
That's right, and you care about Verad,
and we can save them both.

563
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,623
Don't you see?

564
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,460
Dax and Verad
were never meant to be joined.

565
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:24,797
We've got to remove the symbiont
while there's still time.

566
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,428
If you hurt him...

567
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,098
I'll kill you.

568
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,064
I don't doubt it.

569
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,382
The ship... it's gone.

570
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,634
That's because I released
the docking clamps.

571
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,989
Looks like that good-bye
was a little premature.

572
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,201
Don't be ridiculous.
You're not going to shoot me.

573
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,536
What makes you so sure?

574
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,498
This is Dax you're talking to, Benjamin.

575
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:44,210
We both know that if you shoot me,
even on stun,

576
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,587
you risk killing the symbiont.

577
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:50,424
If I let you go, Jadzia dies.

578
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,384
But Dax will live.

579
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,971
What's one girl's life
compared to eight lifetimes

580
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,723
of knowledge and experience?

581
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:04,647
You're not going to shoot me.
You know that, and so do I.

582
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,236
Good-bye, Benjamin.

583
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:14,740
Verad.

584
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,958
Don't call me Benjamin.

585
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,793
( groans )

586
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,107
I feel strange.

587
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:51,277
So empty.

588
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:55,489
It's over now, Verad.
The symbiont is back where it belongs.

589
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:58,659
So close.

590
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,538
I had it.

591
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,208
I had it, and...

592
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,754
Now I'm alone.

593
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,340
You're not alone, Verad.

594
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:15,968
I'm here.

595
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,054
I'll always be here.

596
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,726
I can't remember any of it.

597
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:28,522
The knowledge...

598
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:32,109
The confidence...

599
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:35,904
It's all gone.

600
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:38,532
BASHIR: Commander?

601
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:46,665
Jadzia.

602
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:53,213
Are you?

603
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,590
I'm fine.

604
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,931
I remember it all, Benjamin,
everything he thought, everything he did,

605
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:05,934
and it's so sad.

606
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,441
I guess...

607
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,694
He'll always be with me.
