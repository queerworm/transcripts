1
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:08,333
Station Log, Stardate 47182.1.

2
00:00:08,372 --> 00:00:10,468
DS9 has been
temporarily evacuated

3
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,607
due to a violent
plasma disruption.

4
00:00:12,648 --> 00:00:14,379
Until the disturbance ends

5
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:17,186
we'll be forced to maintain the
station with a skeleton crew.

6
00:00:17,259 --> 00:00:19,058
How are we holding up?

7
00:00:19,096 --> 00:00:20,463
So far, so good.

8
00:00:20,499 --> 00:00:21,900
I'll say one thing
for the Cardassians

9
00:00:21,935 --> 00:00:23,062
they built this place to last.

10
00:00:23,105 --> 00:00:24,734
Just in case it doesn't

11
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,873
I've got the <i>Orinoco</i>
prepped and ready at Pad C.

12
00:00:27,915 --> 00:00:29,475
Any word from Chief O'Brien?

13
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:31,147
He and Odo checked in
about an hour ago.

14
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:33,558
They sealed off the airlocks
in the upper and lower pylons

15
00:00:33,594 --> 00:00:35,461
and were moving
on to the docking ring.

16
00:00:35,499 --> 00:00:36,558
Sisko to O'Brien.

17
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:37,569
O'Brien here.

18
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:38,936
What's your status, Chief?

19
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:41,171
Almost done, Commander.

20
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:44,912
We've sealed all the airlocks
on levels 21, 22, and 23.

21
00:00:44,953 --> 00:00:47,186
We still have to check
the outer bulkheads

22
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:49,628
to make sure there hasn't been
any crystallization

23
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,825
from the plasma discharges.

24
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:52,027
It shouldn't take too long.

25
00:00:52,068 --> 00:00:54,505
O'Brien out.

26
00:00:58,115 --> 00:01:00,085
Did you hear that?

27
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,178
Hear what?

28
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:03,749
I could have sworn
I heard something.

29
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:08,237
Quark!

30
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:09,604
What are you doing here?

31
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,738
You're under strict orders
from Sisko to stay in the bar.

32
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,249
I'm not a prisoner, Odo.

33
00:01:14,317 --> 00:01:15,809
I volunteered to stay

34
00:01:15,854 --> 00:01:18,052
and help you protect
the station.

35
00:01:18,093 --> 00:01:20,063
The only reason you volunteered

36
00:01:20,097 --> 00:01:22,033
is because there wasn't
enough room

37
00:01:22,067 --> 00:01:23,559
on the evacuation shuttles

38
00:01:23,604 --> 00:01:25,597
for 600 bars
of gold-pressed latinum

39
00:01:25,642 --> 00:01:27,009
which still doesn't explain

40
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,516
what you're doing out here
in the docking ring.

41
00:01:31,388 --> 00:01:34,189
I was saying good-bye
to my brother.

42
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:35,754
Your brother?

43
00:01:35,798 --> 00:01:38,737
His shuttle left
three hours ago.

44
00:01:38,771 --> 00:01:41,299
Funny...
it's only been three hours

45
00:01:41,343 --> 00:01:43,974
and I'm already lost
without him.

46
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:45,109
Oh, please!

47
00:01:45,152 --> 00:01:48,125
Don't try to tell me
you've been sitting out here

48
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,958
all this time pining for Rom.

49
00:01:49,996 --> 00:01:51,989
I know, I know.

50
00:01:52,033 --> 00:01:56,475
He couldn't find a cup of water
if you dropped him in a lake

51
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,245
but, even if he is an idiot,
he's still my brother.

52
00:02:00,285 --> 00:02:04,283
And you'd betray him in a second
if it suited your interests.

53
00:02:04,394 --> 00:02:06,558
That doesn't mean
I don't love him.

54
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:09,971
Chief, do you have any brothers?

55
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:13,309
As a matter of fact, I have two.

56
00:02:13,414 --> 00:02:15,942
And did you ever have
to say good-bye to them?

57
00:02:15,986 --> 00:02:17,853
Sure, when I joined Starfleet.

58
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,826
And did it bring a tear
to your eye?

59
00:02:21,465 --> 00:02:22,934
I suppose so.

60
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:27,934
Well, try explaining that
to him.

61
00:04:39,334 --> 00:04:41,498
The storm's intensity is up 37%.

62
00:04:41,606 --> 00:04:43,303
Is there any way of telling
how long it'll last?

63
00:04:43,343 --> 00:04:45,439
Your guess is as good as mine.

64
00:04:45,481 --> 00:04:47,007
Plasma storms are
extremely rare.

65
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:48,748
But look on the bright side.

66
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,385
This gives us a great
opportunity to study one.

67
00:04:51,427 --> 00:04:52,622
Oh, lucky us.

68
00:04:52,664 --> 00:04:54,725
You should see the view
from the Promenade.

69
00:04:54,768 --> 00:04:55,736
It's simply amazing.

70
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,672
I assume the Promenade
is secure.

71
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:58,676
Oh, yes, sir.

72
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,678
I've struck the sails

73
00:04:59,712 --> 00:05:01,204
and battened the hatches,
so to speak.

74
00:05:01,249 --> 00:05:04,245
Benjamin, you better take
a look at this.

75
00:05:06,594 --> 00:05:08,587
I'm detecting a small vessel

76
00:05:08,632 --> 00:05:11,502
headed this way
at one quarter impulse.

77
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:13,098
They're hailing us.

78
00:05:13,141 --> 00:05:14,336
On screen.

79
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:17,746
I can't get a visual.

80
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:20,154
This is the Cargo Ship <i>Ekina.</i>

81
00:05:20,191 --> 00:05:22,355
We've been caught by the storm.

82
00:05:22,395 --> 00:05:24,889
Our engines have been
severely damaged.

83
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:26,904
We need emergency assistance.

84
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:28,306
Can you read me?

85
00:05:28,342 --> 00:05:32,875
Repeat, this
is the Cargo Ship <i>Ekina...</i>

86
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:34,251
I've lost it.

87
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:37,558
Can we get a transporter lock
on the crew?

88
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:40,966
No, there's
too much interference.

89
00:05:41,003 --> 00:05:41,993
Engage the tractor beam.

90
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:43,770
Bring them in
to the closest docking bay.

91
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:45,142
There might be casualties.

92
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,808
I'll get down to the Infirmary.

93
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:47,817
Good idea.

94
00:05:47,851 --> 00:05:50,049
Sisko to O'Brien.

95
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,559
O'Brien here.

96
00:05:51,592 --> 00:05:53,221
Chief, we've got
some storm victims

97
00:05:53,263 --> 00:05:54,698
coming in to Docking Bay Five

98
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:56,293
who may be
in need of assistance.

99
00:05:56,337 --> 00:05:57,863
I'll have to release
the emergency seal

100
00:05:57,907 --> 00:05:59,877
on the airlock before they
can board the station.

101
00:05:59,911 --> 00:06:00,901
On my way.

102
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,571
Stand clear.

103
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:21,257
Are you all right?

104
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,259
Is anyone hurt?

105
00:06:22,293 --> 00:06:23,261
Not yet.

106
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:25,459
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

107
00:06:25,501 --> 00:06:26,469
No questions.

108
00:06:26,503 --> 00:06:28,473
This is a nice way
to show your gratitude.

109
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:29,458
We just saved
your lives out there.

110
00:06:29,591 --> 00:06:33,760
You see...
the ever-helpful Federation.

111
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,927
So predictable.

112
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:37,440
Listen, friend,
in case you haven't heard

113
00:06:37,475 --> 00:06:40,311
the Federation and the Klingon
Empire are allies now.

114
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,876
The Empire is governed

115
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,950
by doddering fools
and frightened old women

116
00:06:45,994 --> 00:06:49,331
who aren't worthy
of the name "Klingon."

117
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:52,033
Mareel! The combadge.

118
00:06:53,644 --> 00:06:55,671
This one must be
the shape-shifter.

119
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:58,745
Go on!
What are you waiting for?

120
00:07:04,802 --> 00:07:07,000
You're a Trill.

121
00:07:11,049 --> 00:07:12,678
You! Shifter!

122
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:13,880
Inside.

123
00:07:13,922 --> 00:07:17,555
And what if I refuse?

124
00:07:17,596 --> 00:07:21,833
Please, do as he says
and no one will get hurt.

125
00:07:21,873 --> 00:07:23,365
Now!

126
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,972
Or this one dies.

127
00:07:49,534 --> 00:07:50,935
Let's go...

128
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:52,563
ally.

129
00:07:57,284 --> 00:07:59,277
Chief, were there
any casualties?

130
00:07:59,321 --> 00:08:00,881
That depends on you.

131
00:08:00,925 --> 00:08:02,792
What's this all about?

132
00:08:04,165 --> 00:08:06,032
Yeto, get the Ferengi.

133
00:08:06,103 --> 00:08:08,404
Any more questions?

134
00:08:08,441 --> 00:08:09,910
Don't hurt him.

135
00:08:09,945 --> 00:08:12,246
Mareel! The box.

136
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:16,247
Put it in your stasis chamber.

137
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:19,059
Now, or I will destroy it.

138
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,602
Is that supposed to be
some kind of threat?

139
00:08:21,637 --> 00:08:23,801
They've got Odo in there.

140
00:08:25,813 --> 00:08:28,046
I see.

141
00:08:28,085 --> 00:08:29,314
Well, in that case...

142
00:08:43,518 --> 00:08:45,955
I'm still not getting a response
from O'Brien or Odo.

143
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,017
Run a level-3 security scan.

144
00:08:48,062 --> 00:08:49,759
Don't bother.

145
00:08:52,038 --> 00:08:56,412
Please, take your hands
away from the controls.

146
00:08:58,084 --> 00:08:59,313
Now!

147
00:09:00,756 --> 00:09:02,658
Get to the center of the room.

148
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:07,900
Do as he says.

149
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,220
Don't worry, Verad.

150
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:18,056
It's going to be all right.

151
00:09:34,163 --> 00:09:36,133
Get with the others.

152
00:09:36,168 --> 00:09:37,569
Move!

153
00:09:39,575 --> 00:09:41,910
Your turn, little man.

154
00:09:46,924 --> 00:09:49,191
Don't forget
to disable the backups

155
00:09:49,296 --> 00:09:51,426
as well as the primary systems.

156
00:09:55,443 --> 00:09:57,140
It's my fault, Commander.

157
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:59,048
They caught us by surprise.

158
00:09:59,084 --> 00:10:01,453
Somehow, they must
have neutralized

159
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,893
the security systems
in the docking ring.

160
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:05,158
How did they manage that?

161
00:10:05,198 --> 00:10:08,330
I'm not sure, but I've
got a pretty good idea.

162
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:11,936
We ran across Quark in an
airlock a little while ago.

163
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:13,448
When this is over

164
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:16,181
Quark and I are going
to have a little talk.

165
00:10:24,406 --> 00:10:26,342
Do you know him?

166
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,512
Ah, Yeto.

167
00:10:42,546 --> 00:10:46,042
It's such a pleasure
doing business with Klingons.

168
00:10:46,087 --> 00:10:49,994
You're so, um... punctual.

169
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:53,470
I see your ship was rescued
according to plan.

170
00:10:53,504 --> 00:10:56,500
Um, I've got your merchandise
right here

171
00:10:56,544 --> 00:10:58,981
but I don't see any latinum.

172
00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:00,280
You Ferengi!

173
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:03,690
You think you're so clever,
but you're stupid.

174
00:11:03,727 --> 00:11:06,198
Now, now, there's no need
for name-calling.

175
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:09,205
If you don't want
these liquid data chains

176
00:11:09,238 --> 00:11:12,473
I'm sure I can line up
dozens of other buyers.

177
00:11:12,512 --> 00:11:14,505
Go right ahead.

178
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,779
Yeto

179
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,316
you expect me to believe
that you've come all this way

180
00:11:19,394 --> 00:11:21,558
braved the storm,
just to tell me

181
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:23,569
that the deal is off?

182
00:11:23,603 --> 00:11:24,867
Stupid Ferengi!

183
00:11:27,445 --> 00:11:29,541
I said, no one moves.

184
00:11:29,584 --> 00:11:31,213
I'm Commander of this station.

185
00:11:31,254 --> 00:11:32,746
What is your business here?

186
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,660
You'll have to ask my employer.

187
00:11:39,973 --> 00:11:44,005
I'm... I'm sorry about all this.

188
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:46,110
If everyone would just cooperate

189
00:11:46,153 --> 00:11:48,624
I promise it will
all be over soon.

190
00:11:48,658 --> 00:11:50,628
What will be over soon?

191
00:11:50,663 --> 00:11:51,927
This is an outrage!

192
00:11:51,965 --> 00:11:53,264
I demand to be released at once!

193
00:11:53,302 --> 00:11:54,566
Enough of your whining!

194
00:11:54,604 --> 00:11:55,572
Who are these people?

195
00:11:55,607 --> 00:11:56,734
What do they want from us?

196
00:11:56,776 --> 00:11:59,772
Funny. I was about
to ask you that question.

197
00:11:59,817 --> 00:12:01,286
- That's enough.
- I agree.

198
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,222
Now tell me what you want here.

199
00:12:05,996 --> 00:12:08,057
Dax.

200
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:11,941
I... want Dax.

201
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:14,709
She's not going anywhere
with you.

202
00:12:14,749 --> 00:12:16,378
No, no.

203
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:18,320
I don't want the girl.

204
00:12:18,357 --> 00:12:21,090
I only want
what is rightfully mine...

205
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,897
what should have been mine
years ago.

206
00:12:27,143 --> 00:12:29,979
I want Dax.

207
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:32,852
The symbiont, Benjamin.

208
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:35,919
He's come to steal my symbiont.

209
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:48,421
You can't remove
Jadzia's symbiont.

210
00:12:48,456 --> 00:12:50,426
If you do, she'll die.

211
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,327
He knows that, Doctor.

212
00:12:52,365 --> 00:12:54,335
I'm...

213
00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:56,932
I'm sorry about all this.

214
00:12:56,975 --> 00:12:58,877
Please, believe me

215
00:12:58,913 --> 00:13:01,476
I wish I didn't
have to do this.

216
00:13:01,586 --> 00:13:03,556
Then don't.

217
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:07,030
I don't have a choice.

218
00:13:07,064 --> 00:13:09,661
I... spent my whole life

219
00:13:09,704 --> 00:13:12,198
trying to qualify
for the joining.

220
00:13:12,243 --> 00:13:16,651
I... studied constantly

221
00:13:16,685 --> 00:13:18,712
every day, every waking hour.

222
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:23,461
I sacrificed... everything

223
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,464
and then I went before
the symbiosis evaluation board

224
00:13:27,576 --> 00:13:29,102
and...

225
00:13:29,146 --> 00:13:35,491
they reduced my entire life
to one word...

226
00:13:35,594 --> 00:13:38,498
unsuitable.

227
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,401
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

228
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,211
Neither of my parents
or my sister underwent symbiosis

229
00:13:45,248 --> 00:13:48,221
and they live happy
and productive lives.

230
00:13:48,255 --> 00:13:51,223
Only one Trill in ten
is chosen to be joined.

231
00:13:51,355 --> 00:13:53,086
That's easy for you to say.

232
00:13:53,127 --> 00:13:54,152
They chose you.

233
00:13:54,229 --> 00:13:56,564
I was one of the lucky ones.

234
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:58,970
Now it's Verad's time
to be lucky.

235
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:00,339
Why Dax?

236
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,812
There are thousands
of symbionts on Trill.

237
00:14:02,847 --> 00:14:03,940
Why her?

238
00:14:03,984 --> 00:14:05,077
I did research.

239
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:06,645
I worked it all out.

240
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:09,456
The Dax symbiont
is the best match for me.

241
00:14:09,495 --> 00:14:12,468
We have mutual interests...
science, diplomacy...

242
00:14:12,502 --> 00:14:13,835
Verad...

243
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:16,502
there is another reason,
isn't there?

244
00:14:16,545 --> 00:14:18,481
The wormhole.

245
00:14:18,515 --> 00:14:20,782
After you've stolen the symbiont

246
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,417
you plan on escaping to
the Gamma Quadrant, don't you?

247
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:26,899
Can you think of a better place
to start a new life?

248
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:28,163
I understand your frustration

249
00:14:28,204 --> 00:14:29,833
but there could be
dozens of reasons

250
00:14:29,874 --> 00:14:32,402
why the board didn't
select you for symbiosis.

251
00:14:32,446 --> 00:14:34,815
They have to be very careful.

252
00:14:34,851 --> 00:14:38,656
An improper joining can cause
permanent psychological damage

253
00:14:38,693 --> 00:14:42,098
to both the symbiont
and the host.

254
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:45,197
They were only looking
after your best interests.

255
00:14:45,274 --> 00:14:48,679
Your best interests maybe,
but not mine.

256
00:14:48,715 --> 00:14:51,209
All they've done is condemn me

257
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,156
to a life of... of...

258
00:14:55,797 --> 00:14:57,198
mediocrity.

259
00:14:57,233 --> 00:14:59,169
Well, I refuse to accept that.

260
00:14:59,205 --> 00:15:03,044
I-I'm not going to spend
the rest of my life dreaming

261
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:07,784
about what I could have been.

262
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:10,158
What I should have been.

263
00:15:10,195 --> 00:15:14,193
I deserve... more

264
00:15:14,305 --> 00:15:16,742
and I'm going to get it.

265
00:15:16,777 --> 00:15:19,750
Yeto, T'Kar, it's time.

266
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,382
I'll have no part in this.

267
00:15:24,427 --> 00:15:28,162
I... I understand.

268
00:15:33,847 --> 00:15:36,250
Keep away from him, Doctor.

269
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,682
There, you see?

270
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:42,255
I've taken the first step.

271
00:15:44,905 --> 00:15:48,208
Even if I don't get what I want,
my life is over

272
00:15:48,246 --> 00:15:49,681
so either you help me

273
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,982
or you and your friends
will die.

274
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,924
It's your choice.

275
00:15:54,961 --> 00:15:55,986
He'll help.

276
00:15:56,029 --> 00:16:00,266
I don't want anyone else hurt
because of me.

277
00:16:00,305 --> 00:16:03,437
But you have
to give me your word

278
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:07,887
that no one else on this station
will be harmed.

279
00:16:07,922 --> 00:16:09,255
I... I promise.

280
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:10,453
Doctor.

281
00:16:12,298 --> 00:16:15,669
Do as he says, Julian, please.

282
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:28,194
Let me treat Chief O'Brien's
phaser wound first.

283
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:29,702
It won't take long.

284
00:16:29,736 --> 00:16:33,609
There's an emergency
medical kit in the console.

285
00:16:33,645 --> 00:16:35,478
Get it!

286
00:16:41,562 --> 00:16:42,963
Hold still, Chief.

287
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:53,613
There.

288
00:16:53,656 --> 00:16:55,820
There should be
no permanent damage.

289
00:16:56,997 --> 00:17:00,368
Apply this
every 20 minutes or so.

290
00:17:00,471 --> 00:17:02,373
It should help
the wound regenerate.

291
00:17:02,408 --> 00:17:03,900
Enough stalling!

292
00:17:03,945 --> 00:17:05,881
Do as he says, Doctor.

293
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:07,784
This is no time to be a hero.

294
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,018
Take them to the Infirmary.

295
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:12,895
This isn't over, Dax.

296
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,093
I promise you.

297
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:15,261
Dax...

298
00:17:17,742 --> 00:17:19,803
I know, Benjamin.

299
00:17:19,846 --> 00:17:22,147
You'll do everything you can.

300
00:17:22,185 --> 00:17:24,679
And just in case it isn't enough

301
00:17:24,724 --> 00:17:27,355
I want you to know
it's been fun.

302
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:30,534
Let's go.

303
00:17:36,918 --> 00:17:38,251
Good luck.

304
00:17:38,287 --> 00:17:41,522
It won't be long now,
and then you'll see.

305
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:45,696
Everything will be
just as I promised.

306
00:17:45,737 --> 00:17:47,570
I know.

307
00:18:02,574 --> 00:18:03,542
What's that?

308
00:18:03,576 --> 00:18:04,875
It's a delta wave inducer

309
00:18:04,912 --> 00:18:07,543
to keep you asleep
during the operation.

310
00:18:07,585 --> 00:18:10,148
It also increases your body's
natural endorphin production

311
00:18:10,191 --> 00:18:11,990
to help accelerate
the healing process.

312
00:18:12,028 --> 00:18:13,292
I don't want it.

313
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,924
I strongly recommend
that you use it.

314
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:17,404
The surgery will be
much easier on you if...

315
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,239
I don't want your advice.

316
00:18:21,215 --> 00:18:22,775
I want to be awake.

317
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:25,416
Use a neuroelectrical
suppresser

318
00:18:25,524 --> 00:18:27,391
and set up a monitor

319
00:18:27,428 --> 00:18:30,161
so that I can watch
the procedure.

320
00:18:30,202 --> 00:18:32,400
That way, if you run
into any trouble

321
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:33,429
I can assist you.

322
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:36,640
Now, let's get started.

323
00:18:44,198 --> 00:18:46,328
I'm sorry, Jadzia.

324
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,954
Don't blame yourself, Julian.

325
00:18:55,992 --> 00:18:58,088
You did everything you could.

326
00:18:58,129 --> 00:18:59,222
I...

327
00:19:02,205 --> 00:19:04,266
This will help you sleep.

328
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,371
Thank you.

329
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:16,897
Forgive me.

330
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:27,056
How long can Dax survive
without the symbiont?

331
00:19:27,093 --> 00:19:29,154
Once the symbiont is removed

332
00:19:29,197 --> 00:19:31,668
the host usually
dies within hours

333
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,072
but Jadzia is young and healthy.

334
00:19:34,108 --> 00:19:36,101
Bashir will do what he can.

335
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:38,515
She'll make it
through the night.

336
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:41,318
That still doesn't
give us much time.

337
00:19:41,358 --> 00:19:42,587
No talking!

338
00:19:43,796 --> 00:19:45,459
No!

339
00:20:06,146 --> 00:20:08,811
I don't want to kill you,
Commander, but I will!

340
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:48,874
This is ridiculous.

341
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,752
Don't you realize
they're going to kill us?

342
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:54,259
What are you people
sitting around for?

343
00:21:54,294 --> 00:21:55,387
Do something.

344
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,127
Do you have any suggestions?

345
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:59,364
Why should I have
any suggestions?

346
00:21:59,405 --> 00:22:01,501
I'm not the military
mastermind.

347
00:22:01,543 --> 00:22:03,513
I'm just a victim
of circumstances.

348
00:22:03,547 --> 00:22:04,708
Victim? Really?

349
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,451
Then maybe you'd like to tell me
how four armed terrorists

350
00:22:08,491 --> 00:22:10,518
got by our docking ring
security grid.

351
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:11,531
Security grid?

352
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:12,966
I don't know anything about...

353
00:22:13,002 --> 00:22:13,970
Save it, Quark.

354
00:22:14,004 --> 00:22:16,031
You crossed the line this time.

355
00:22:16,075 --> 00:22:17,100
You sold us out

356
00:22:17,144 --> 00:22:19,080
and now Dax may die
because of it.

357
00:22:19,115 --> 00:22:22,019
Well, whatever happens next,
one thing is certain...

358
00:22:22,055 --> 00:22:23,581
you are through here.

359
00:22:34,415 --> 00:22:36,750
Are you all right?

360
00:22:36,787 --> 00:22:38,086
I'll live.

361
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:39,092
Don't try that again.

362
00:22:39,126 --> 00:22:40,720
I don't want to have
to hurt anyone.

363
00:22:40,763 --> 00:22:42,596
Tell that to Jadzia.

364
00:22:42,633 --> 00:22:45,127
That's different.

365
00:22:47,077 --> 00:22:48,546
Do you really believe that?

366
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:50,048
You heard Verad.

367
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,882
They didn't leave him
any other choice.

368
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,289
No, that's his reason.
What's yours?

369
00:22:54,326 --> 00:22:55,453
I owe him.

370
00:22:55,495 --> 00:22:58,365
I grew up on the streets
of Khefka IV.

371
00:22:58,401 --> 00:23:00,599
I never would have made it
out of there without Verad.

372
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,907
What was he doing on Khefka IV?

373
00:23:02,945 --> 00:23:07,114
He was the communications clerk
at the Federation Consulate.

374
00:23:07,154 --> 00:23:08,281
He used to visit

375
00:23:08,323 --> 00:23:10,988
the accommodation house
where I worked.

376
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:12,760
I used to help him relax.

377
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,831
When he was recalled to Trill,
he asked me to go with him.

378
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:19,005
We've been together ever since.

379
00:23:19,047 --> 00:23:20,710
And that's it?

380
00:23:20,751 --> 00:23:22,915
He got you out
of a bad situation

381
00:23:22,956 --> 00:23:25,587
and now you're willing
to kill for him?

382
00:23:25,628 --> 00:23:27,097
I owe him my life.

383
00:23:27,132 --> 00:23:29,797
If there's anything
I can do for him

384
00:23:29,837 --> 00:23:30,964
I'll do it.

385
00:23:31,006 --> 00:23:33,273
Even if it means losing him?

386
00:23:35,215 --> 00:23:36,616
Losing him?

387
00:23:36,652 --> 00:23:38,053
After the surgery

388
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:42,360
Verad won't be
just Verad anymore.

389
00:23:42,398 --> 00:23:45,131
He'll be a blending
of Verad, Dax

390
00:23:45,171 --> 00:23:47,004
and all the previous hosts...

391
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:51,142
their memories, their knowledge,
even their personalities.

392
00:23:51,184 --> 00:23:55,683
Verad told me that you'd
say things like that.

393
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:57,629
I know he'll change.

394
00:23:57,665 --> 00:23:59,898
He'll be smarter,
more confident

395
00:23:59,937 --> 00:24:02,431
but in all the important ways,
he'll be the same.

396
00:24:02,476 --> 00:24:05,209
I'm sorry, but if he
told you that, he's lying.

397
00:24:05,315 --> 00:24:08,516
Once a Trill is joined,
it's like a rebirth.

398
00:24:08,555 --> 00:24:11,322
He'll be an entirely
different person.

399
00:24:11,362 --> 00:24:12,591
If you think I'm going

400
00:24:12,631 --> 00:24:14,066
to betray Verad, you're wrong.

401
00:24:14,101 --> 00:24:17,563
It doesn't matter what you say.

402
00:24:17,609 --> 00:24:19,739
I love him

403
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,682
and I'm going to stand by him

404
00:24:21,718 --> 00:24:23,745
no matter what.

405
00:24:23,788 --> 00:24:25,918
I never doubted it.

406
00:24:27,831 --> 00:24:29,961
Verad.

407
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,645
No, not just Verad.

408
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,153
I'm Verad Dax.

409
00:25:06,883 --> 00:25:08,682
Take this.

410
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:10,020
Come on, we haven't got
much time.

411
00:25:10,057 --> 00:25:11,720
Just move it back and forth
over the wound

412
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:12,729
in slow, even strokes.

413
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:13,788
Why bother?

414
00:25:13,832 --> 00:25:15,461
She'll be dead
in a few hours anyway.

415
00:25:15,502 --> 00:25:17,199
Not if I have anything
to do with it.

416
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,265
Now, help me.

417
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:19,277
Why should I?

418
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:21,213
She let herself
be slaughtered

419
00:25:21,248 --> 00:25:22,717
like a mindless <i>t'gla.</i>

420
00:25:22,752 --> 00:25:26,089
If she wanted to live,
she should have fought back.

421
00:25:26,126 --> 00:25:28,791
She did what she did
to save the rest of us.

422
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:31,132
Then she is a fool,
and she deserves her fate.

423
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,641
Now listen to me, Yeto,
or whatever your name is.

424
00:25:33,676 --> 00:25:35,202
I don't give a damn
about your warrior ethic

425
00:25:35,246 --> 00:25:36,339
or your Klingon philosophy.

426
00:25:36,381 --> 00:25:38,351
This woman is dying, and I need
your help to save her.

427
00:25:38,386 --> 00:25:39,821
Now, take this instrument.

428
00:25:39,856 --> 00:25:42,293
Well... so the little human

429
00:25:42,328 --> 00:25:44,765
has some spark after all.

430
00:26:00,134 --> 00:26:04,235
Come on. Come on.

431
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:17,364
Julian.

432
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:19,301
Oh, thank God.

433
00:26:19,336 --> 00:26:22,537
I thought I'd lost you.

434
00:26:22,577 --> 00:26:24,570
The symbiont.

435
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:27,780
It's gone.

436
00:26:27,822 --> 00:26:30,123
Oh, everything went perfectly.

437
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,064
The operation was
a complete success.

438
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:37,064
I feel so alone.

439
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:39,170
I've got you stabilized.

440
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,517
If only we could get
the symbiont back in time.

441
00:26:43,556 --> 00:26:46,187
I'm scared, Julian.

442
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:49,634
You're not going to die.

443
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:51,229
Do you hear me?

444
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,911
I'm not going to let you die.

445
00:26:57,487 --> 00:27:00,152
I've never felt so empty.

446
00:27:03,032 --> 00:27:05,367
Just rest.

447
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,677
Dax?

448
00:27:10,382 --> 00:27:12,284
That's right, Benjamin.

449
00:27:13,722 --> 00:27:14,951
It's me.

450
00:27:14,992 --> 00:27:18,193
Curzon, Tobin, Jadzia...

451
00:27:18,266 --> 00:27:21,706
all the others...
they're all a part of you now.

452
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,901
It's amazing.

453
00:27:22,943 --> 00:27:24,104
So many ideas.

454
00:27:24,146 --> 00:27:25,581
So many memories.

455
00:27:25,615 --> 00:27:27,950
Eight lifetimes of memories.

456
00:27:27,987 --> 00:27:29,854
It must be incredible.

457
00:27:29,891 --> 00:27:32,658
It's better
than I ever imagined.

458
00:27:32,698 --> 00:27:34,634
The station must look
very different to you now.

459
00:27:34,668 --> 00:27:35,693
It does.

460
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:39,405
I... I know this place.

461
00:27:41,718 --> 00:27:44,622
And I know you, Benjamin.

462
00:27:44,657 --> 00:27:46,650
Of course you do.

463
00:27:46,695 --> 00:27:47,822
Remember when we first met?

464
00:27:47,864 --> 00:27:48,854
Pelios Station.

465
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,868
Anastasia?

466
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:51,201
And that trip we took

467
00:27:51,238 --> 00:27:52,639
to the Cliffs of Bole?

468
00:27:54,178 --> 00:27:57,242
All the months we served
aboard the <i>Livingston.</i>

469
00:27:57,285 --> 00:27:58,948
And Science Officer
Kustanovich.

470
00:27:58,988 --> 00:28:00,047
What was it?

471
00:28:00,091 --> 00:28:02,654
Eight helpings
of Andorian Redbat?

472
00:28:04,467 --> 00:28:08,238
I don't think I've ever
seen someone eat so much.

473
00:28:08,343 --> 00:28:09,676
Remember my wedding?

474
00:28:09,712 --> 00:28:11,648
I remember
your bachelor party

475
00:28:11,684 --> 00:28:13,153
or some of it anyway.

476
00:28:14,523 --> 00:28:17,655
And the time we discovered
the wormhole.

477
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:20,762
My, my, my.

478
00:28:22,908 --> 00:28:25,072
One of Jadzia's
proudest moments.

479
00:28:25,113 --> 00:28:27,209
And now that woman
is bleeding to death

480
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,275
in the Infirmary.

481
00:28:28,387 --> 00:28:30,688
I'd rather not discuss that,
Benjamin.

482
00:28:30,725 --> 00:28:32,388
You have to discuss it, Dax.

483
00:28:32,428 --> 00:28:35,161
You know as well as I do,
we can't let her die.

484
00:28:35,202 --> 00:28:36,569
She's not going to die.

485
00:28:36,604 --> 00:28:37,903
She'll live on in me.

486
00:28:37,941 --> 00:28:40,242
Jadzia's memories will live on

487
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:44,618
but Jadzia herself will die,
and you'll have killed her.

488
00:28:44,655 --> 00:28:46,522
You think I don't know that?

489
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,655
I'll never be able to forget it

490
00:28:48,698 --> 00:28:50,497
but I promise you, Benjamin

491
00:28:50,535 --> 00:28:52,904
I'll do all I can
to make up for it.

492
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,776
I'm not going
to the Gamma Quadrant to hide.

493
00:28:55,813 --> 00:28:58,341
There are entire worlds
who can benefit

494
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,584
from my knowledge
and experience.

495
00:29:00,624 --> 00:29:02,457
I can help them, and I will.

496
00:29:02,494 --> 00:29:04,430
I have a better idea.

497
00:29:04,466 --> 00:29:05,867
What's that?

498
00:29:05,903 --> 00:29:07,566
Help Jadzia.

499
00:29:07,606 --> 00:29:09,839
Come with me down
to the Infirmary.

500
00:29:09,877 --> 00:29:12,405
Put the symbiont
back where it belongs.

501
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,617
I can't do that, Benjamin,
even if I wanted to.

502
00:29:15,657 --> 00:29:17,924
Don't you see?
It's too late.

503
00:29:17,962 --> 00:29:20,195
The integration
is already underway.

504
00:29:20,234 --> 00:29:22,101
But there's still time
to stop it.

505
00:29:22,138 --> 00:29:24,336
Jadzia's life
can still be saved.

506
00:29:24,376 --> 00:29:25,640
Don't listen to him.

507
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,740
He's just trying to confuse you.

508
00:29:27,784 --> 00:29:29,253
It's all right, Mareel.

509
00:29:29,287 --> 00:29:31,520
Benjamin, the symbiont
is still weak

510
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:32,753
from the operation.

511
00:29:32,795 --> 00:29:35,289
If we attempt
another joining so soon...

512
00:29:35,334 --> 00:29:36,667
it might not survive.

513
00:29:36,703 --> 00:29:38,696
Are you willing to risk that?

514
00:29:38,741 --> 00:29:40,335
I am.

515
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:44,251
The question is, are you?

516
00:29:44,287 --> 00:29:46,690
Why are you wasting
your time with him?

517
00:29:46,726 --> 00:29:48,195
Because he's my friend!

518
00:29:48,228 --> 00:29:50,756
Now, go watch the others.

519
00:29:55,411 --> 00:29:58,350
We are still friends,
aren't we, Benjamin?

520
00:29:58,384 --> 00:30:00,617
I hope so.

521
00:30:00,656 --> 00:30:03,423
Come with me down
to the Infirmary

522
00:30:03,462 --> 00:30:04,589
and prove it.

523
00:30:06,735 --> 00:30:08,637
I can't do that.

524
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,118
Then you're not
the Dax that I know.

525
00:30:16,224 --> 00:30:19,891
Our friendship is over.

526
00:30:47,726 --> 00:30:49,355
Here, drink this.

527
00:30:49,397 --> 00:30:51,026
What is it?

528
00:30:51,067 --> 00:30:52,627
Senarian egg broth.

529
00:30:52,671 --> 00:30:54,801
It'll keep your strength up.

530
00:30:54,841 --> 00:30:56,538
All right, don't drink it.

531
00:30:56,645 --> 00:30:58,638
It makes no difference to me.

532
00:30:58,684 --> 00:31:00,153
Hold on.

533
00:31:00,187 --> 00:31:02,180
Thank you.

534
00:31:11,712 --> 00:31:14,913
He even looks different,
doesn't he?

535
00:31:14,952 --> 00:31:18,859
The way he stands,
the way he moves, talks.

536
00:31:18,894 --> 00:31:21,195
He's better than he was.

537
00:31:21,233 --> 00:31:23,203
I'm glad you think so.

538
00:31:23,237 --> 00:31:25,036
I do.

539
00:31:25,074 --> 00:31:27,875
Really? The way
he dismissed you before?

540
00:31:27,914 --> 00:31:29,679
Verad never did that.

541
00:31:29,718 --> 00:31:32,315
He's under a lot of stress.

542
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:33,325
Verad was under stress

543
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:34,851
the minute he stepped
onto this station

544
00:31:34,896 --> 00:31:36,263
but he never turned
on you, did he?

545
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:37,563
What's your point, Commander?

546
00:31:37,635 --> 00:31:38,934
I think you know.

547
00:31:38,972 --> 00:31:41,808
You're trying
to turn me against Verad.

548
00:31:41,844 --> 00:31:43,575
Verad no longer exists.

549
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,518
You know that better than I do.

550
00:31:45,553 --> 00:31:48,389
All right, then.
Verad Dax, but it won't work.

551
00:31:48,426 --> 00:31:50,693
Nothing has changed between us.

552
00:31:50,731 --> 00:31:52,530
You really believe that?

553
00:31:52,568 --> 00:31:55,369
Yes.

554
00:31:55,408 --> 00:31:57,378
All right.

555
00:31:57,412 --> 00:32:00,385
Then make me believe it.

556
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:03,722
Go in there and talk to him.

557
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,559
Talk to him about what?

558
00:32:05,597 --> 00:32:08,330
I don't know.
Whatever you want.

559
00:32:08,369 --> 00:32:10,840
I'm sure the two of you

560
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:13,745
have a lot to say
to one another.

561
00:32:13,782 --> 00:32:15,752
I don't want to disturb him.

562
00:32:15,786 --> 00:32:17,255
Why not?

563
00:32:17,289 --> 00:32:19,054
Because I don't want to!

564
00:32:19,093 --> 00:32:21,587
Well, look at him,
sitting in there all alone.

565
00:32:21,665 --> 00:32:22,598
He needs you.

566
00:32:22,701 --> 00:32:23,828
That's enough.

567
00:32:23,871 --> 00:32:26,069
I don't understand why you're
being so reluctant.

568
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:28,011
This is the perfect time
for the two of you

569
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,014
to get reacquainted.

570
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:30,608
I said that's enough!

571
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:32,018
Mareel.

572
00:32:32,055 --> 00:32:35,392
Is anything wrong?

573
00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:37,194
No, everything's fine.

574
00:32:37,233 --> 00:32:38,964
Good.

575
00:32:39,004 --> 00:32:40,974
Be careful.

576
00:32:41,008 --> 00:32:45,143
I wouldn't want anything
to happen to you.

577
00:33:02,554 --> 00:33:05,550
I got him!
I got him!

578
00:33:07,699 --> 00:33:09,134
Stay back.

579
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:15,682
Maybe we should talk
about this, huh?

580
00:33:19,892 --> 00:33:21,759
My ear.

581
00:33:26,139 --> 00:33:28,667
Pathetic.

582
00:33:28,712 --> 00:33:29,805
Mareel...

583
00:33:29,848 --> 00:33:31,978
take him to the Infirmary.

584
00:33:44,881 --> 00:33:46,350
What is it now?

585
00:33:46,384 --> 00:33:48,787
Please... it hurts.

586
00:33:48,823 --> 00:33:50,292
All right.

587
00:33:50,325 --> 00:33:51,817
Hold on.

588
00:33:53,767 --> 00:33:57,799
The damage appears to be
fairly superficial.

589
00:33:57,842 --> 00:33:59,277
No.

590
00:33:59,312 --> 00:34:02,649
But Ferengi ears
are incredibly sensitive.

591
00:34:02,686 --> 00:34:05,453
So I'd better run
some further tests.

592
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:16,474
The storm's intensity's
dropped another 20%.

593
00:34:17,819 --> 00:34:20,052
I know this has been
hard for you, Benjamin.

594
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:21,526
It's been hard for both of us

595
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:22,654
but it's almost over.

596
00:34:22,697 --> 00:34:24,291
Good.

597
00:34:24,334 --> 00:34:26,828
I'm getting tired
of waiting here.

598
00:34:28,509 --> 00:34:29,636
How are you feeling?

599
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,549
Better than ever,
thanks to you.

600
00:34:32,585 --> 00:34:35,820
I couldn't have done this
without you.

601
00:34:35,859 --> 00:34:40,096
I would have spent the rest
of my life a mediocre man

602
00:34:40,135 --> 00:34:43,108
only dreaming about
what might have been.

603
00:34:43,142 --> 00:34:45,169
You know what you have to do.

604
00:34:45,246 --> 00:34:47,376
You just worry about getting
through the wormhole.

605
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,855
The Klingons and I will make
sure that no one stops you.

606
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:51,723
Remember, I don't want you
staying here

607
00:34:51,761 --> 00:34:53,128
any longer than you have to.

608
00:34:53,164 --> 00:34:55,191
Give me an hour,
then head for the wormhole.

609
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:57,432
The runabout's on Pad C.

610
00:34:57,473 --> 00:34:59,671
The sooner you leave,
the sooner I can follow

611
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:01,341
and the sooner
we'll be together.

612
00:35:07,027 --> 00:35:10,159
It's going to be
all right, isn't it?

613
00:35:10,268 --> 00:35:14,107
Just wait for me
at the rendezvous point.

614
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:35,787
Stop whining or I'll put you
out of your misery.

615
00:35:35,824 --> 00:35:36,883
It's not his fault.

616
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,193
He's got a deep contusion
of the auricular lobe

617
00:35:39,232 --> 00:35:40,861
and a possible
dislocated malleus.

618
00:35:40,902 --> 00:35:43,169
In a Ferengi, either condition
could be fatal.

619
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:47,239
But if you want him to stop,
give me a hand with this.

620
00:35:47,283 --> 00:35:48,251
I'm not your nurse!

621
00:35:48,285 --> 00:35:51,258
Look, let's not
go through that again.

622
00:35:51,291 --> 00:35:52,988
Just hold this
against his ear.

623
00:35:58,909 --> 00:36:01,244
Not too hard.

624
00:36:03,251 --> 00:36:05,312
Just another second.

625
00:36:07,928 --> 00:36:10,422
Relax.

626
00:36:14,944 --> 00:36:16,413
There.

627
00:36:16,447 --> 00:36:18,748
Thank you, Doctor.

628
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:21,689
I feel better already.

629
00:36:25,634 --> 00:36:27,001
How is she?

630
00:36:28,273 --> 00:36:29,366
I have her stabilized

631
00:36:29,408 --> 00:36:31,845
but there's no telling
how much time she has left.

632
00:36:31,881 --> 00:36:34,945
We've got to get the symbiont
back before it's too late.

633
00:36:34,988 --> 00:36:36,457
What are you doing?

634
00:36:36,491 --> 00:36:37,960
Odo's in here.

635
00:36:37,994 --> 00:36:39,463
He is?

636
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,968
Yes, and we've got
to get him out.

637
00:36:42,003 --> 00:36:42,971
Are you sure?

638
00:36:43,005 --> 00:36:43,995
Quark...

639
00:36:45,277 --> 00:36:47,680
If only we knew the access code.

640
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:50,680
Allow me.

641
00:37:04,652 --> 00:37:08,957
Ah... standard
Delgorian locking mechanism.

642
00:37:08,996 --> 00:37:11,627
Sophisticated...

643
00:37:11,668 --> 00:37:14,003
but vulnerable
if you know its weaknesses.

644
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,841
Hand me that laser scalpel.

645
00:37:21,356 --> 00:37:23,019
Uh-huh.

646
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,533
Mm-hmm.

647
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:38,018
It's a gift.

648
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:40,360
The storm's decreased
another 15%.

649
00:37:40,398 --> 00:37:41,366
Excellent.

650
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,994
That should be
more than enough

651
00:37:43,037 --> 00:37:45,030
to allow safe passage
to the wormhole.

652
00:37:45,075 --> 00:37:46,874
Verad to Yeto.

653
00:37:48,749 --> 00:37:51,050
Verad to Yeto.

654
00:37:51,088 --> 00:37:52,387
Yeto, report!

655
00:37:52,425 --> 00:37:54,828
The doctor must have
overpowered him.

656
00:37:54,863 --> 00:37:56,560
The doctor?!
Impossible.

657
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,727
It's the shape-shifter.

658
00:37:57,769 --> 00:37:59,568
He must have freed
the shape-shifter.

659
00:37:59,606 --> 00:38:01,576
T'Kar, get me to the ship.

660
00:38:01,611 --> 00:38:04,344
You'd better take
a hostage just in case.

661
00:38:04,384 --> 00:38:05,853
I'll go with you.

662
00:38:05,887 --> 00:38:08,222
I'd love your company,
Benjamin

663
00:38:08,259 --> 00:38:11,596
but somehow, I don't think you
have my best interests at heart.

664
00:38:11,633 --> 00:38:12,897
Kira, I hate
to inconvenience you...

665
00:38:12,936 --> 00:38:14,029
That's all right.

666
00:38:14,072 --> 00:38:15,131
If Odo's free

667
00:38:15,174 --> 00:38:17,441
there's no way you're
getting off this station.

668
00:38:21,421 --> 00:38:23,084
Mareel?

669
00:38:24,128 --> 00:38:25,688
Good luck.

670
00:38:27,435 --> 00:38:29,929
Well, Benjamin,
I guess this is good-bye.

671
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,970
Not many friendships
last over two lifetimes.

672
00:38:33,013 --> 00:38:36,748
I wish
we could have made it three.

673
00:38:36,789 --> 00:38:39,785
You'll be seeing
me again, Verad.

674
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,849
So...

675
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:06,760
where's this rendezvous
going to be?

676
00:39:08,033 --> 00:39:10,732
You don't really
expect me to tell you.

677
00:39:10,773 --> 00:39:13,006
No, but I hope you like it there

678
00:39:13,044 --> 00:39:16,415
because you'll be waiting
for Verad a long time.

679
00:39:16,451 --> 00:39:17,784
How would you know?

680
00:39:17,821 --> 00:39:19,313
You told me yourself.

681
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:21,225
I saw the look on your face

682
00:39:21,262 --> 00:39:23,665
when he asked you
to wait for him.

683
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,407
The plan was, he was supposed
to get there first.

684
00:39:29,447 --> 00:39:33,148
That he would wait for me,
not the other way around.

685
00:39:33,188 --> 00:39:36,355
Well, maybe it was
an honest mistake.

686
00:39:36,395 --> 00:39:38,228
A slip of the tongue.

687
00:39:38,266 --> 00:39:39,860
No.

688
00:39:39,903 --> 00:39:41,132
He lied to me.

689
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,673
He's never lied to me before.

690
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:48,753
He's not coming.

691
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:52,655
He doesn't need me anymore.

692
00:39:52,698 --> 00:39:54,999
No, you're wrong.

693
00:39:56,674 --> 00:39:59,510
He does need you now,
more than ever.

694
00:40:01,517 --> 00:40:04,421
You never give up, do you?

695
00:40:04,457 --> 00:40:07,258
I told you, I'm not going
to betray him.

696
00:40:07,296 --> 00:40:08,890
I'm not asking you to.

697
00:40:08,933 --> 00:40:12,031
I'm asking you to save him,
to help us save him.

698
00:40:12,074 --> 00:40:14,341
All you care about
is Jadzia.

699
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:15,905
That's right,
and you care about Verad

700
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:18,147
and we can save them both.

701
00:40:19,156 --> 00:40:20,523
Don't you see?

702
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:23,623
Dax and Verad were never
meant to be joined.

703
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:27,903
We've got to remove the symbiont
while there's still time.

704
00:40:32,051 --> 00:40:33,850
If you hurt him...

705
00:40:35,893 --> 00:40:37,624
I'll kill you.

706
00:40:43,543 --> 00:40:45,342
I don't doubt it.

707
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:10,394
The ship...

708
00:41:10,435 --> 00:41:11,460
it's gone.

709
00:41:11,504 --> 00:41:13,771
That's because I released
the docking clamps.

710
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:35,351
Looks like that good-bye
was a little premature.

711
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,585
Don't be ridiculous.

712
00:41:36,626 --> 00:41:38,425
You're not going to shoot me.

713
00:41:38,464 --> 00:41:40,662
What makes you so sure?

714
00:41:40,701 --> 00:41:43,674
This is Dax
you're talking to, Benjamin.

715
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:47,239
We both know that if you
shoot me, even on stun

716
00:41:47,283 --> 00:41:49,686
you risk killing the symbiont.

717
00:41:49,721 --> 00:41:53,560
If I let you go, Jadzia dies.

718
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:55,191
But Dax will live.

719
00:41:55,234 --> 00:41:59,767
What's one girl's life
compared to eight lifetimes

720
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:01,780
of knowledge and experience?

721
00:42:03,786 --> 00:42:05,688
You're not going to shoot me.

722
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:08,092
You know that, and so do I.

723
00:42:11,502 --> 00:42:13,837
Good-bye, Benjamin.

724
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,009
Verad.

725
00:42:24,365 --> 00:42:27,600
Don't call me Benjamin.

726
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,683
I feel strange.

727
00:42:52,927 --> 00:42:54,453
So empty.

728
00:42:54,497 --> 00:42:56,091
It's over now, Verad.

729
00:42:56,134 --> 00:42:59,038
The symbiont is back
where it belongs.

730
00:42:59,074 --> 00:43:02,138
So close.

731
00:43:03,718 --> 00:43:05,916
I had it.

732
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:09,789
I had it, and...

733
00:43:11,568 --> 00:43:14,404
now I'm alone.

734
00:43:14,441 --> 00:43:18,006
You're not alone, Verad.

735
00:43:18,049 --> 00:43:20,680
I'm here.

736
00:43:20,721 --> 00:43:22,851
I'll always be here.

737
00:43:24,864 --> 00:43:27,028
I can't remember any of it.

738
00:43:30,543 --> 00:43:31,876
The knowledge...

739
00:43:33,917 --> 00:43:35,546
the confidence...

740
00:43:37,826 --> 00:43:39,625
it's all gone.

741
00:43:40,632 --> 00:43:42,295
Commander?

742
00:43:48,716 --> 00:43:50,743
Jadzia.

743
00:43:54,863 --> 00:43:56,526
Are you?

744
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:58,036
I'm fine.

745
00:44:00,509 --> 00:44:03,448
I remember it all, Benjamin...

746
00:44:03,482 --> 00:44:07,685
everything he thought,
everything he did...

747
00:44:07,724 --> 00:44:09,387
and it's so sad.

748
00:44:13,771 --> 00:44:17,211
I guess...

749
00:44:17,246 --> 00:44:19,479
he'll always be with me.
