1
00:00:09,584 --> 00:00:13,026
Morn, if you're not too busy

2
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,587
I'd appreciate it
if you did something

3
00:00:14,631 --> 00:00:16,899
about that shipment
of Livanian beets

4
00:00:16,937 --> 00:00:19,307
you have sitting in Cargo Bay 3.

5
00:00:19,345 --> 00:00:21,840
It's been there
for over two weeks.

6
00:00:21,885 --> 00:00:23,412
It's starting to rot.

7
00:00:26,197 --> 00:00:27,223
Morn!

8
00:00:29,005 --> 00:00:31,239
It's a hologram.

9
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:34,412
Morn's been away on business
for the last two weeks.

10
00:00:34,454 --> 00:00:36,517
You're slipping, Odo.

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,463
You should've caught on
a lot sooner.

12
00:00:38,498 --> 00:00:41,267
You replaced Morn
with a hologram?

13
00:00:41,306 --> 00:00:42,275
Why?

14
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,278
Evening.

15
00:00:43,312 --> 00:00:44,281
Hello, Morn.

16
00:00:44,315 --> 00:00:45,284
That's why.

17
00:00:45,317 --> 00:00:46,286
People love him.

18
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:48,220
He's like a mascot.

19
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:50,424
Everyone who comes in here
expects to see him

20
00:00:50,465 --> 00:00:53,234
and if they don't, it doesn't
feel like home to them.

21
00:00:53,273 --> 00:00:55,268
And that's not good
for business.

22
00:00:55,311 --> 00:00:57,476
The last time he went away

23
00:00:57,518 --> 00:01:00,925
my sales dropped
almost five percent.

24
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:02,157
Oh.

25
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:04,831
Why doesn't it talk?

26
00:01:04,872 --> 00:01:05,841
Do you have any idea

27
00:01:05,874 --> 00:01:09,840
how much an interactive
holo-projector costs?

28
00:01:09,886 --> 00:01:15,300
Besides, it's a relief not
to have to listen to him go on.

29
00:01:15,401 --> 00:01:17,031
You know Morn...

30
00:01:17,072 --> 00:01:19,044
he never shuts up.

31
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:21,141
I'd trade this
for the real thing any day.

32
00:01:21,184 --> 00:01:23,987
I'm sure Morn
would be very touched

33
00:01:24,025 --> 00:01:25,552
to hear you say that.

34
00:01:25,597 --> 00:01:27,933
Morn!

35
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,999
No, it's just a hologram.

36
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:31,945
You look like you saw a ghost.

37
00:01:31,981 --> 00:01:33,177
Turn it off.

38
00:01:33,217 --> 00:01:34,447
Why?

39
00:01:34,488 --> 00:01:35,514
We just got word.

40
00:01:35,558 --> 00:01:38,225
Morn's cargo ship
was caught in an ion storm.

41
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,359
Is he all right?

42
00:01:39,402 --> 00:01:40,393
Was he rescued?

43
00:01:41,775 --> 00:01:43,074
He's dead.

44
00:03:44,815 --> 00:03:45,784
Did you bring anything?

45
00:03:45,818 --> 00:03:46,787
Hmm?

46
00:03:46,821 --> 00:03:47,790
To the memorial service?

47
00:03:47,823 --> 00:03:49,122
I didn't know I was supposed to.

48
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:50,221
Well, it's a Lurian custom

49
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:52,064
to bring gifts of food
and drink for the deceased

50
00:03:52,102 --> 00:03:54,165
so they have something to
sustain them in the afterlife.

51
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,442
Oh. Well, maybe I can get
something in Quark's.

52
00:03:56,481 --> 00:03:58,680
I hate to think of the
big fella going without.

53
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:01,320
Morn was an excellent
sparring partner.

54
00:04:01,362 --> 00:04:04,165
I will miss our weekly
combat in the holosuites.

55
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,003
I can't believe
he's really gone.

56
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,445
I did not realize he
was such a close friend.

57
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:11,114
Well, I used to have
a little crush on him.

58
00:04:11,155 --> 00:04:13,286
Morn?

59
00:04:13,328 --> 00:04:15,162
Well, it was before we met.

60
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,727
Besides, he wasn't interested.

61
00:04:16,771 --> 00:04:18,708
What do you mean
he wasn't interested?

62
00:04:18,743 --> 00:04:20,475
Oh, forget I mentioned it.

63
00:04:20,515 --> 00:04:22,076
Is that a bottle opener?

64
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:23,555
Hmm. For Morn.

65
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,957
I thought it might
come in handy.

66
00:04:24,994 --> 00:04:26,624
Very thoughtful.

67
00:04:32,347 --> 00:04:34,319
This is unbelievable.

68
00:04:34,353 --> 00:04:36,883
Look at all these people.

69
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:40,567
If you see anyone empty-handed

70
00:04:40,604 --> 00:04:43,544
sell them a bottle
of Yridian ale.

71
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,418
Tell them it was
Morn's favorite.

72
00:04:50,565 --> 00:04:52,560
Very kind of you
to do this, Quark.

73
00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:54,405
I'm sure Morn
would've appreciated it.

74
00:04:54,443 --> 00:04:56,574
It's the least I could do.

75
00:04:56,616 --> 00:04:58,713
I'll miss him.

76
00:04:58,755 --> 00:05:01,023
Sorry.

77
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:03,556
Can I get you anything?

78
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:07,979
I don't ordinarily imbibe
on the job, but...

79
00:05:08,014 --> 00:05:10,282
maybe a Yridian ale.

80
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:12,224
It was Morn's favorite.

81
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:13,228
Oh.

82
00:05:13,262 --> 00:05:14,595
Well, perfect.

83
00:05:24,928 --> 00:05:26,923
What are you looking at?

84
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:31,068
Your respect for the dead
is heartwarming.

85
00:05:31,112 --> 00:05:32,411
I'll have you know

86
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:35,480
Morn died without paying
this month's bar tab.

87
00:05:35,524 --> 00:05:39,262
Oh, how inconsiderate of him.

88
00:05:39,302 --> 00:05:41,433
We're talking
about a lot of money.

89
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:43,606
The man had quite an appetite.

90
00:05:43,647 --> 00:05:46,416
You know he had
two stomachs to fill.

91
00:05:46,454 --> 00:05:48,152
Ever watch him eat?

92
00:05:48,193 --> 00:05:49,993
It was a beautiful thing.

93
00:05:50,098 --> 00:05:53,939
Well, sometimes you don't truly
appreciate what you have

94
00:05:53,976 --> 00:05:55,309
until it's gone.

95
00:05:55,346 --> 00:05:59,312
It's nice to know you're
so worried about my welfare.

96
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,421
You should be worried, too.

97
00:06:01,463 --> 00:06:05,304
Now that your mascot's gone,
business will suffer.

98
00:06:05,341 --> 00:06:06,640
We'll see.

99
00:06:06,678 --> 00:06:08,239
You might be surprised.

100
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,986
Jadzia.

101
00:06:11,024 --> 00:06:12,220
Can we please drop this?

102
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,702
Everyone, thank you all
for coming.

103
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:20,741
It means a great deal to me

104
00:06:20,784 --> 00:06:25,354
to see so many people cared
about Morn as much as I did.

105
00:06:25,397 --> 00:06:29,534
I'll never forget
the first time he walked in here

106
00:06:29,575 --> 00:06:32,310
and sat down on that very stool.

107
00:06:34,322 --> 00:06:36,658
It must've been...

108
00:06:36,695 --> 00:06:39,430
almost ten years ago.

109
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,377
He still had his hair then.

110
00:06:45,386 --> 00:06:47,858
I thought he was just

111
00:06:47,893 --> 00:06:51,130
another customer
passing through.

112
00:06:52,907 --> 00:06:55,506
Little did I know...

113
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:58,579
he'd become
such an important figure

114
00:06:58,623 --> 00:07:00,560
in my life...

115
00:07:00,596 --> 00:07:02,157
in all our lives.

116
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,765
Morn was always
someone we could count on

117
00:07:04,807 --> 00:07:06,277
for a cheerful smile...

118
00:07:06,311 --> 00:07:09,480
and an entertaining story.

119
00:07:09,521 --> 00:07:10,923
Some of you might be thinking

120
00:07:10,957 --> 00:07:12,952
this place won't be the same
without him.

121
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:17,204
And it won't.

122
00:07:18,947 --> 00:07:21,283
But this was his home.

123
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:26,130
And wherever he is,
I'm sure he'd want to know

124
00:07:26,234 --> 00:07:28,729
that his favorite bar
still echoed

125
00:07:28,774 --> 00:07:33,151
with the laughter
of his dear friends.

126
00:07:35,794 --> 00:07:38,860
This was his chair.

127
00:07:38,903 --> 00:07:42,971
And I think the greatest tribute
we could ever pay him

128
00:07:43,014 --> 00:07:46,512
would be to make sure
that it is never empty.

129
00:07:54,847 --> 00:07:56,317
Keep it warm...

130
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,981
for Morn.

131
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:14,963
Every now and then,
Quark really surprises me.

132
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:17,670
Me, too.

133
00:08:22,358 --> 00:08:23,828
Excuse me, Quark.

134
00:08:23,861 --> 00:08:25,160
Not now.

135
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,999
I'm sorry to intrude

136
00:08:27,037 --> 00:08:29,670
but I thought you should know.

137
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:31,511
I unsealed Morn's will.

138
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,222
He left everything to you.

139
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,388
Me?

140
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:39,837
He left everything to me?

141
00:08:39,873 --> 00:08:41,172
That's right.

142
00:08:43,517 --> 00:08:44,577
Morn...

143
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:47,618
dear

144
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:49,963
sweet Morn.

145
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:51,973
Oh...

146
00:09:04,006 --> 00:09:07,448
The poor fool actually believed
you cared about him.

147
00:09:07,484 --> 00:09:08,783
I did.

148
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,954
I was up for hours last
night thinking about him.

149
00:09:11,996 --> 00:09:13,694
Calculating his net worth,
no doubt.

150
00:09:13,734 --> 00:09:15,602
We spent a lot
of time together, Odo.

151
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,374
We were obviously a lot closer
than I ever realized.

152
00:09:19,985 --> 00:09:22,184
His financial records.

153
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:27,071
Is this some kind of joke?

154
00:09:27,105 --> 00:09:28,335
What do you mean?

155
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,742
According to this, he was broke.

156
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:31,340
No.

157
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,284
How can that be?

158
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,487
He paid his bar bill
at the end of every month.

159
00:09:35,528 --> 00:09:37,362
That kind of money must have
come from somewhere.

160
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:40,738
Well, he did have
his shipping business.

161
00:09:40,777 --> 00:09:45,222
Maybe all his assets
are tied up in inventory.

162
00:09:45,256 --> 00:09:46,886
Of course.

163
00:09:46,927 --> 00:09:48,021
Inventory.

164
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:53,067
I'll unload everything

165
00:09:53,111 --> 00:09:55,549
and use the profits to...

166
00:09:55,584 --> 00:09:57,248
Ooh, what's that smell?

167
00:09:57,289 --> 00:09:58,691
Your inheritance.

168
00:09:58,727 --> 00:10:00,595
Livanian beets.

169
00:10:00,632 --> 00:10:01,931
Very ripe.

170
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:04,373
What's in the rest of these?

171
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:05,970
More beets.

172
00:10:06,014 --> 00:10:07,712
That's it?

173
00:10:07,752 --> 00:10:09,222
That's all he had?

174
00:10:09,256 --> 00:10:10,886
I'm afraid so.

175
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:16,872
Except for the contents
of his quarters.

176
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:21,856
Maybe he spent all his money
on furnishings and works of art.

177
00:10:21,891 --> 00:10:23,486
<i>Objets d'art.</i>

178
00:10:23,595 --> 00:10:25,498
Of course.

179
00:10:25,535 --> 00:10:27,096
<i>Objets d'art.</i>

180
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:28,335
Of course.

181
00:10:28,376 --> 00:10:29,436
I'll hold an auction.

182
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:30,743
People will pay a premium

183
00:10:30,782 --> 00:10:32,879
to own something
that used to be Morn's.

184
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,534
Are you sure these
are the right quarters?

185
00:10:40,577 --> 00:10:42,309
I'm sure.

186
00:10:42,348 --> 00:10:43,818
Figures.

187
00:10:44,922 --> 00:10:46,552
What's that?

188
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,760
That, I believe, is a matador.

189
00:10:49,803 --> 00:10:51,330
No.

190
00:10:51,373 --> 00:10:52,866
That.

191
00:10:52,911 --> 00:10:55,213
That's Morn's bed.

192
00:10:55,251 --> 00:10:56,915
Morn slept in...

193
00:10:56,955 --> 00:10:58,083
mud?

194
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,185
Hmm.

195
00:10:59,228 --> 00:11:02,294
I'm told it's excellent
for the skin.

196
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:07,382
Thanks, Morn.

197
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:09,413
Just what I always wanted.

198
00:11:14,538 --> 00:11:16,806
What are you doing in my mud?

199
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:19,580
Oh, I... I couldn't resist.

200
00:11:19,619 --> 00:11:22,091
Morny and I had
so many happy times here,

201
00:11:22,126 --> 00:11:24,291
I just... I had to slip in.

202
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,532
I'm sorry if I startled you.

203
00:11:26,572 --> 00:11:30,413
I heard you coming in
and I thought I'd better hide.

204
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,011
Who are you?

205
00:11:32,053 --> 00:11:33,489
Um...

206
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:34,960
Larell.

207
00:11:34,996 --> 00:11:36,626
Morn's wife.

208
00:11:36,734 --> 00:11:38,033
Well, ex-wife.

209
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,540
Morn was married?

210
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:40,635
To you?

211
00:11:40,745 --> 00:11:43,583
For two wonderful years.

212
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,784
You must be Quark.

213
00:11:45,825 --> 00:11:49,996
Morny and I kept in touch
after we were separated.

214
00:11:50,038 --> 00:11:54,004
He talked about you
all the time.

215
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:55,348
That's nice.

216
00:11:55,385 --> 00:11:59,158
He told me that if anything
ever happened to him

217
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:02,638
he wanted you to have everything
that was ever his.

218
00:12:03,642 --> 00:12:05,135
Everything?

219
00:12:06,483 --> 00:12:08,386
Everything.

220
00:12:10,394 --> 00:12:12,662
Well, I'm glad you came by

221
00:12:12,768 --> 00:12:17,179
because Morny didn't leave
me much of anything else.

222
00:12:17,214 --> 00:12:19,516
Why, I find that
hard to believe.

223
00:12:20,857 --> 00:12:23,660
I'm as disappointed as you are.

224
00:12:23,698 --> 00:12:25,191
I happen to know

225
00:12:25,236 --> 00:12:28,700
that he had quite
a substantial retirement fund

226
00:12:28,745 --> 00:12:32,312
one that could make two people
very comfortable.

227
00:12:34,161 --> 00:12:36,531
If you're partial to mud

228
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:38,869
it's comfortable, all right.

229
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:40,742
I'm talking
about the thousand bricks

230
00:12:40,846 --> 00:12:42,076
of gold-pressed latinum

231
00:12:42,116 --> 00:12:44,885
that he won
in the Lissepian Lottery.

232
00:12:44,924 --> 00:12:46,758
A thousand bricks?

233
00:12:46,796 --> 00:12:47,992
Mm-hmm.

234
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,469
Now that he's gone

235
00:12:49,504 --> 00:12:51,134
it's all ours.

236
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,697
What are you doing?

237
00:13:19,734 --> 00:13:20,964
What do you think?

238
00:13:21,071 --> 00:13:23,543
I'm looking for the latinum.

239
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:25,982
You must know where he kept it.

240
00:13:26,085 --> 00:13:30,997
I didn't even know it existed
until you told me.

241
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,245
Well, I'm sure it's somewhere
on the station.

242
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,755
How do we know he didn't
spend it already?

243
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,924
I told you,
it was for his retirement.

244
00:13:42,966 --> 00:13:44,436
Poor Morn.

245
00:13:44,469 --> 00:13:47,443
He never got a chance
to enjoy it.

246
00:13:47,478 --> 00:13:50,452
But that doesn't mean we can't.

247
00:13:50,486 --> 00:13:53,483
I know what you're doing.

248
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:55,432
What am I doing?

249
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,837
Just so we're clear...

250
00:13:57,873 --> 00:14:01,110
the latinum's mine.

251
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:04,021
He may have left
everything to you

252
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:06,360
but I was his wife.

253
00:14:06,398 --> 00:14:08,164
I could contest the will

254
00:14:08,203 --> 00:14:10,471
and tie you up
in court for years.

255
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:12,036
Maybe.

256
00:14:12,147 --> 00:14:15,019
But there's no reason
it has to come to that.

257
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,323
After all,
a thousand bricks is plenty

258
00:14:17,361 --> 00:14:18,797
for both of us.

259
00:14:18,832 --> 00:14:22,365
It is a lot of money.

260
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:25,476
And as soon as we find it

261
00:14:25,518 --> 00:14:29,188
we'll take a nice
long vacation together.

262
00:14:30,866 --> 00:14:32,997
Morn would have
wanted it that way.

263
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,375
Of course, he would have.

264
00:14:43,569 --> 00:14:45,403
The latinum's not
on the station.

265
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,500
I looked everywhere.

266
00:14:46,543 --> 00:14:47,512
Evade.

267
00:14:47,546 --> 00:14:49,518
I even had
my brother scan for it

268
00:14:49,551 --> 00:14:51,146
with the internal sensors.

269
00:14:51,256 --> 00:14:52,555
Well, at least you have
the painting.

270
00:14:52,594 --> 00:14:53,722
Oh, forget the painting.

271
00:14:53,763 --> 00:14:55,165
I want that latinum.

272
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,604
If you think
it'll make you happy.

273
00:14:57,641 --> 00:14:58,610
Confront.

274
00:14:58,644 --> 00:15:00,512
Believe me, it will.

275
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,989
This is the break
I've been waiting for

276
00:15:05,028 --> 00:15:07,330
and it's been a long time
in coming.

277
00:15:07,368 --> 00:15:08,998
I want Morn's money.

278
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:11,604
I need Morn's money.

279
00:15:11,647 --> 00:15:14,644
I deserve Morn's money.

280
00:15:14,688 --> 00:15:15,850
Your move.

281
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:19,903
Beautiful, isn't it?

282
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:23,174
And the way it picks up
the light.

283
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,182
I wonder who came up
with the idea

284
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:26,778
of suspending liquid latinum

285
00:15:26,822 --> 00:15:29,192
inside worthless bits of gold?

286
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:31,826
Probably someone who got
tired of making change

287
00:15:31,869 --> 00:15:33,202
with an eyedropper.

288
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,302
Are you going to play or not?

289
00:15:38,656 --> 00:15:40,524
Where do you think
Morn put it all?

290
00:15:41,697 --> 00:15:42,791
If you find it, are you really

291
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:44,064
going to share it
with this woman?

292
00:15:44,104 --> 00:15:45,471
I agreed to pay her ten percent

293
00:15:45,508 --> 00:15:47,206
so she wouldn't tie me up
in court.

294
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,545
That's 100 bricks.

295
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:49,985
What could I do?

296
00:15:50,021 --> 00:15:51,514
Retreat.

297
00:15:52,962 --> 00:15:54,523
I don't know,
but there's something

298
00:15:54,566 --> 00:15:56,230
I don't like
about this whole thing.

299
00:15:56,271 --> 00:15:58,470
I don't trust this woman.

300
00:16:01,486 --> 00:16:02,956
Neither do I

301
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,962
but... that doesn't mean

302
00:16:04,996 --> 00:16:07,230
I'm going to keep her away
from my lobes.

303
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:08,602
Just keep your eyes open.

304
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,337
Don't be fooled
by a pretty face.

305
00:16:10,378 --> 00:16:12,008
Not me.

306
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:13,382
Of course not.

307
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:14,752
Acquire.

308
00:16:29,831 --> 00:16:31,324
Oh...

309
00:16:33,074 --> 00:16:36,983
What a pleasant surprise.

310
00:16:40,094 --> 00:16:42,259
Computer, lights.

311
00:16:44,373 --> 00:16:46,105
Tell me...

312
00:16:46,144 --> 00:16:48,047
you like surprises, Quark?

313
00:16:48,082 --> 00:16:49,609
Only pleasant ones.

314
00:16:50,723 --> 00:16:51,692
I like to think I'm pleasant.

315
00:16:51,726 --> 00:16:53,925
You think I'm pleasant?

316
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:55,230
Absolutely.

317
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:59,771
Then I guess this qualifies
as a pleasant surprise.

318
00:16:59,815 --> 00:17:02,253
What are you doing
in my quarters?

319
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:03,588
Waiting for you.

320
00:17:03,626 --> 00:17:05,256
My brother and I

321
00:17:05,297 --> 00:17:09,263
were business associates
of Morn's.

322
00:17:09,308 --> 00:17:11,610
If you've come
for the memorial service

323
00:17:11,649 --> 00:17:12,948
it was yesterday.

324
00:17:12,986 --> 00:17:14,581
Really? Was it nice?

325
00:17:14,624 --> 00:17:16,619
It was lovely.

326
00:17:16,663 --> 00:17:20,869
I understand you inherited
Morn's estate.

327
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:21,934
That's right.

328
00:17:21,977 --> 00:17:25,475
We're business associates
of Morn's.

329
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:27,493
Your brother mentioned that.

330
00:17:27,526 --> 00:17:31,697
He... borrowed some money
from us

331
00:17:31,738 --> 00:17:37,050
and we'd like the estate
to repay the loan.

332
00:17:37,086 --> 00:17:38,385
Uh-huh.

333
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,159
How much money
are we talking about?

334
00:17:41,198 --> 00:17:42,828
Oh...

335
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:48,181
1,000 bricks
of gold-pressed latinum.

336
00:17:48,217 --> 00:17:50,747
I had a feeling
you were going to say that.

337
00:17:52,262 --> 00:17:55,863
I need to see documentation
regarding this loan.

338
00:17:58,012 --> 00:18:00,713
We shook hands.

339
00:18:00,753 --> 00:18:03,157
We trusted Morn.

340
00:18:03,192 --> 00:18:06,690
And I'm sure he'd want you...

341
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:09,574
to honor his word.

342
00:18:10,614 --> 00:18:12,711
I'm sure he would

343
00:18:12,752 --> 00:18:15,020
but you have to understand

344
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:19,266
Morn's assets are all tied up
in various enterprises.

345
00:18:19,304 --> 00:18:24,980
I hope you're not saying
you don't have the money.

346
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,356
That wouldn't be good.

347
00:18:28,931 --> 00:18:31,165
Uh... all I meant was

348
00:18:31,205 --> 00:18:33,039
it'll take me
a little while to get it.

349
00:18:33,076 --> 00:18:35,344
So you do know where it is.

350
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:36,351
Of course.

351
00:18:36,385 --> 00:18:38,219
You're not the first creditors

352
00:18:38,257 --> 00:18:40,422
to make a claim
against his estate.

353
00:18:40,463 --> 00:18:42,492
We're not?

354
00:18:42,536 --> 00:18:44,940
Morn was expanding
his business interests

355
00:18:44,976 --> 00:18:46,275
when he died.

356
00:18:46,313 --> 00:18:49,116
His resources were stretched
somewhat thin.

357
00:18:49,155 --> 00:18:51,958
As a result,
the claims against the estate

358
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:54,161
are greater than the assets.

359
00:18:56,107 --> 00:18:59,276
Obviously, you can't expect
full repayment.

360
00:18:59,316 --> 00:19:00,546
What can we expect?

361
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:01,782
A percentage.

362
00:19:01,824 --> 00:19:02,884
What sort of percentage?

363
00:19:02,927 --> 00:19:04,123
- Twenty.
- We can't accept

364
00:19:04,163 --> 00:19:05,063
less than 80.

365
00:19:05,098 --> 00:19:06,294
I'll make it 30

366
00:19:06,336 --> 00:19:08,935
and I'll throw in a shipment
of Livanian beets.

367
00:19:08,976 --> 00:19:10,172
I don't like beets.

368
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:11,308
We'll take 70.

369
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,546
Forty.

370
00:19:12,587 --> 00:19:15,288
And because I can see
you both have fine taste

371
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:17,128
I'm willing to part with this.

372
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:20,140
One of Morn's most
treasured possessions.

373
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:21,975
Beautiful, isn't it?

374
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:24,144
Very nice.

375
00:19:24,186 --> 00:19:25,588
We can't take less than 60.

376
00:19:25,689 --> 00:19:26,988
40's the best I can do.

377
00:19:27,027 --> 00:19:28,155
- Fifty.
- Sorry.

378
00:19:31,874 --> 00:19:33,504
50, it is.

379
00:19:33,545 --> 00:19:35,379
I'm glad

380
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:38,323
we could come
to an understanding.

381
00:19:38,358 --> 00:19:39,691
Me, too.

382
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:47,773
We'll be watching you, Quark.

383
00:19:47,818 --> 00:19:49,584
Don't try anything.

384
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:50,853
Me?

385
00:19:50,894 --> 00:19:52,056
Don't be ridiculous.

386
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,301
What do we have here?

387
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:18,292
Computer, what is this?

388
00:20:18,337 --> 00:20:21,744
A claim slip
for Storage Locker 137

389
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,148
located
in the Station Assay Office.

390
00:20:24,187 --> 00:20:26,489
A storage locker!

391
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:28,327
Thank you, computer.

392
00:20:28,365 --> 00:20:30,803
You've been very helpful.

393
00:20:33,847 --> 00:20:37,084
Morn, wherever you are,
I love you!

394
00:20:40,536 --> 00:20:43,031
What do you mean I have
to open it in here?

395
00:20:43,077 --> 00:20:44,444
Regulations... the contents

396
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,475
of a deceased person's
storage locker

397
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,890
have to be inspected
by station security.

398
00:20:48,926 --> 00:20:50,396
There's no such regulation.

399
00:20:50,431 --> 00:20:51,924
You just want to know
what's inside.

400
00:20:51,968 --> 00:20:53,028
You are so transparent.

401
00:20:53,071 --> 00:20:55,874
I can't wait to see your face
when your deputies

402
00:20:55,913 --> 00:20:59,082
wheel in my thousand
bricks of latinum.

403
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,895
Ah, here we are.

404
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:03,729
Thank you.

405
00:21:03,768 --> 00:21:06,002
That can't be it.

406
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,913
Storage Locker 137.

407
00:21:11,288 --> 00:21:13,522
Well... sometimes

408
00:21:13,561 --> 00:21:15,863
good things come
in small packages.

409
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,475
Hmm...

410
00:21:20,515 --> 00:21:24,082
will that be enough
to cover Morn's bar tab?

411
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,728
It's covered.

412
00:21:27,768 --> 00:21:30,104
There's more
where this came from.

413
00:21:30,141 --> 00:21:31,839
What makes you say that?

414
00:21:31,879 --> 00:21:33,041
Take a look.

415
00:21:36,927 --> 00:21:37,793
On the bottom.

416
00:21:39,634 --> 00:21:42,106
Recognize Morn's handwriting?

417
00:21:42,142 --> 00:21:45,880
"The rest is
in the Bank of Bolias."

418
00:21:45,918 --> 00:21:48,756
Account number C-J-5-74-36.

419
00:21:48,794 --> 00:21:50,287
Hmph.

420
00:21:50,331 --> 00:21:52,964
This wasn't in Morn's
financial record.

421
00:21:53,005 --> 00:21:54,498
Who cares?

422
00:21:54,543 --> 00:21:58,577
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to contact the bank

423
00:21:58,621 --> 00:22:00,855
and let them know
Morn's legal heir

424
00:22:00,894 --> 00:22:04,392
would like his latinum delivered
as soon as possible.

425
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,639
Larell...

426
00:22:18,677 --> 00:22:21,276
I've been looking
all over for you.

427
00:22:22,588 --> 00:22:24,081
I'm a busy man.

428
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,324
Not too busy to look
for a certain something, I hope.

429
00:22:26,398 --> 00:22:27,332
Actually

430
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:28,837
I haven't had
much luck with that.

431
00:22:28,873 --> 00:22:31,711
Sounds like you need
a little motivation.

432
00:22:31,747 --> 00:22:33,149
Oh...

433
00:22:33,184 --> 00:22:36,181
I'm motivated, believe me.

434
00:22:36,226 --> 00:22:39,724
It's just that it's
going to take

435
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:41,798
some time to locate,
that's all.

436
00:22:41,842 --> 00:22:43,004
Mm-hmm.

437
00:22:44,483 --> 00:22:47,514
Um... I have an idea.

438
00:22:47,557 --> 00:22:51,330
Why don't you go back
to wherever you come from

439
00:22:51,368 --> 00:22:55,038
and I'll contact you
as soon as I find it?

440
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:58,577
I think I'd rather
wait here... with you.

441
00:23:00,594 --> 00:23:01,927
Oh...

442
00:23:03,268 --> 00:23:05,570
this is not a good time
for <i>oo-mox.</i>

443
00:23:05,608 --> 00:23:07,773
Why? Don't you like it?

444
00:23:07,815 --> 00:23:10,310
Uh, it's not that.

445
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:13,056
It's just that...

446
00:23:13,096 --> 00:23:16,401
the sooner I find
that certain something...

447
00:23:16,472 --> 00:23:18,033
Mmm...

448
00:23:18,076 --> 00:23:21,518
the sooner we can take
our little trip together.

449
00:23:21,552 --> 00:23:23,581
Mm, you're so diligent.

450
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:26,794
Most men don't know
how to defer gratification.

451
00:23:26,834 --> 00:23:28,931
You don't make it easy.

452
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,136
Mm.

453
00:23:44,684 --> 00:23:45,983
Good morning.

454
00:23:54,144 --> 00:23:55,978
Level 17.

455
00:24:02,334 --> 00:24:03,667
You're good.

456
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,473
But... I'm the only one

457
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:10,284
the bank's going
to give the money to.

458
00:24:10,322 --> 00:24:11,655
Yeah.

459
00:24:13,063 --> 00:24:15,593
C-J-5-74-36.

460
00:24:15,637 --> 00:24:18,338
C-J-5-74... uh...

461
00:24:18,378 --> 00:24:19,677
This is my stop.

462
00:24:19,715 --> 00:24:21,949
What's your hurry?

463
00:24:21,988 --> 00:24:25,259
My brother has something
he wants to say to you.

464
00:24:26,634 --> 00:24:28,537
I'm sorry.

465
00:24:31,548 --> 00:24:33,520
About the painting.

466
00:24:33,554 --> 00:24:34,853
He feels terrible.

467
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:36,190
No hard feelings.

468
00:24:36,228 --> 00:24:39,134
That's nice of you
to be so forgiving, Quark.

469
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,469
Don't mention it.

470
00:24:40,506 --> 00:24:43,503
My brother has a nasty temper.

471
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:44,380
I get upset.

472
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:45,386
It comes out

473
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,015
when things don't go our way.

474
00:24:47,058 --> 00:24:48,152
I noticed.

475
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,930
That's why I'm hoping
things start to go our way soon.

476
00:24:50,969 --> 00:24:53,203
Do you understand
what I'm saying, Quark?

477
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:54,541
I think I do, yes.

478
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:56,744
I don't like to get upset.

479
00:24:56,785 --> 00:24:57,811
Don't worry.

480
00:24:57,855 --> 00:24:59,884
Things are going to go
your way soon.

481
00:24:59,927 --> 00:25:02,092
That's good to hear.

482
00:25:04,775 --> 00:25:06,108
I'll keep in touch.

483
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,983
I really am sorry
about the painting.

484
00:25:16,841 --> 00:25:22,585
C-J-5-74-36.
C-J-5-74-36.

485
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,405
Bank of Bolias.

486
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,823
Making a withdrawal, Quark?

487
00:25:36,864 --> 00:25:38,494
Let me guess.

488
00:25:38,535 --> 00:25:41,475
A thousand bricks
of gold-pressed latinum.

489
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,891
Put your hands on your head.

490
00:25:53,244 --> 00:25:54,908
Turn around.

491
00:25:57,288 --> 00:25:59,590
All right,
how much do you want?

492
00:25:59,694 --> 00:26:01,289
And don't ask
for the full 1,000 bricks.

493
00:26:01,332 --> 00:26:03,327
I already gave away
more than half of it.

494
00:26:03,372 --> 00:26:04,398
Attempted bribery.

495
00:26:04,442 --> 00:26:07,007
That should add a few years
to your sentence.

496
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:08,040
What are you talking about?

497
00:26:08,084 --> 00:26:09,053
Let's go.

498
00:26:09,087 --> 00:26:10,056
Go?

499
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,059
Wait, who are you?

500
00:26:11,093 --> 00:26:12,255
Lurian Security.

501
00:26:12,297 --> 00:26:14,565
I have a signed extradition
order for your arrest.

502
00:26:14,603 --> 00:26:15,799
Oh.

503
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,507
As soon as your station's
security chief approves it...

504
00:26:18,547 --> 00:26:19,538
we'll be on our way.

505
00:26:19,584 --> 00:26:21,749
What did I do?
What's the charge?

506
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,559
Conspiracy to intercept
government property.

507
00:26:24,598 --> 00:26:25,794
Government property?

508
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,068
1,000 bricks
of gold-pressed latinum.

509
00:26:28,107 --> 00:26:29,406
Wait a minute.

510
00:26:29,445 --> 00:26:32,511
Morn won that latinum
in the Lissepian Lottery.

511
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:36,023
He didn't?

512
00:26:36,063 --> 00:26:37,362
It was his bequest

513
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,634
from the Royal Family of Luria.

514
00:26:39,706 --> 00:26:41,073
Oh...

515
00:26:41,111 --> 00:26:43,345
Why would the Royal Family
of Luria

516
00:26:43,384 --> 00:26:45,287
give Morn that kind of money?

517
00:26:45,322 --> 00:26:46,849
He was the crown prince.

518
00:26:46,893 --> 00:26:49,297
Morn was a prince?

519
00:26:49,334 --> 00:26:50,530
You didn't know?

520
00:26:50,571 --> 00:26:53,043
Morn was a prince?

521
00:26:53,077 --> 00:26:54,307
That's what I'm saying.

522
00:26:54,348 --> 00:26:56,377
Morn was a prince.

523
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,050
Yes.

524
00:26:58,091 --> 00:27:00,690
But he renounced the throne
when he came of age.

525
00:27:00,732 --> 00:27:02,566
Well, I always knew
he was an idiot.

526
00:27:02,604 --> 00:27:04,872
His family bequeathed
him the latinum

527
00:27:04,911 --> 00:27:06,073
when he abdicated.

528
00:27:06,114 --> 00:27:09,283
But now that he's deceased,
it's legally theirs again.

529
00:27:09,323 --> 00:27:10,850
Uh-uh.

530
00:27:10,893 --> 00:27:12,888
He left it to me.

531
00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:14,836
That will has already
been nullified.

532
00:27:14,871 --> 00:27:17,173
He signed an agreement
to return the latinum

533
00:27:17,212 --> 00:27:18,648
in the event of his death.

534
00:27:19,685 --> 00:27:21,657
Oh.

535
00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:26,566
Do me a favor.

536
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:28,132
Don't tell his ex-wife.

537
00:27:28,175 --> 00:27:30,808
I'm going to need
a little <i>oo-mox</i> later.

538
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,011
His ex-wife?

539
00:27:32,053 --> 00:27:33,317
Larell.

540
00:27:33,357 --> 00:27:35,294
She's here?

541
00:27:35,328 --> 00:27:36,524
Mm-hmm. I just saw her.

542
00:27:39,607 --> 00:27:41,134
Is something wrong?

543
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:42,478
Quiet!

544
00:27:42,515 --> 00:27:44,383
Let me think.

545
00:27:47,997 --> 00:27:49,558
Listen and listen carefully.

546
00:27:49,602 --> 00:27:50,935
Larell has been trying

547
00:27:50,972 --> 00:27:54,038
to get her hands on the prince's
latinum for years.

548
00:27:54,081 --> 00:27:56,144
She's tried blackmail,
extortion.

549
00:27:56,187 --> 00:27:59,356
I wouldn't be surprised
if she was behind his death.

550
00:27:59,395 --> 00:28:00,956
She's always been nice to me.

551
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,367
The Royal Family

552
00:28:02,404 --> 00:28:06,438
would like nothing better
than to see her behind bars.

553
00:28:06,482 --> 00:28:08,613
If you help me apprehend her

554
00:28:08,655 --> 00:28:11,254
there'll be
a substantial reward.

555
00:28:11,296 --> 00:28:13,199
What do I have to do?

556
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:15,068
When are you going
to see her again?

557
00:28:15,107 --> 00:28:16,201
She'll turn up sooner or later.

558
00:28:16,243 --> 00:28:17,770
If not her,
then those two brothers.

559
00:28:17,815 --> 00:28:18,784
Brothers?

560
00:28:18,883 --> 00:28:21,983
They said they were
Morn's business partners.

561
00:28:22,026 --> 00:28:24,294
They claimed he owed them money.

562
00:28:24,332 --> 00:28:25,596
Something tells me

563
00:28:25,636 --> 00:28:27,904
they were not
exactly aboveboard.

564
00:28:27,943 --> 00:28:29,777
Whoever these brothers are

565
00:28:29,814 --> 00:28:31,979
I promise you,
I won't let them get

566
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,789
between the Royal Family
and its latinum.

567
00:28:34,828 --> 00:28:36,925
And I won't let anything get
between me and my reward.

568
00:28:36,968 --> 00:28:38,164
Do we have an understanding?

569
00:28:38,204 --> 00:28:39,173
Uh-huh.

570
00:28:39,207 --> 00:28:41,543
If I'm going to put
these people away

571
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,549
I have to catch them

572
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:44,213
trying to get their hands
on the latinum.

573
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:46,588
Call the bank.

574
00:28:46,628 --> 00:28:48,964
Tell them to deliver it here.

575
00:28:49,002 --> 00:28:49,993
Then what?

576
00:28:51,575 --> 00:28:53,911
You stay out of sight and
leave the rest to me.

577
00:29:02,372 --> 00:29:03,842
What are you up to?

578
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:07,318
Trying to fix
this optronic relay.

579
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:10,524
Wouldn't you be better
off working in a lab?

580
00:29:11,564 --> 00:29:14,094
I'm keeping Morn's chair warm.

581
00:29:14,138 --> 00:29:15,129
Ah.

582
00:29:15,175 --> 00:29:16,405
Good man.

583
00:29:19,052 --> 00:29:20,545
Where's Quark?

584
00:29:20,589 --> 00:29:21,558
I'm in the mood

585
00:29:21,592 --> 00:29:23,894
for one of his famous
Til'amin froths.

586
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:25,594
You'll have to settle
for something else.

587
00:29:25,636 --> 00:29:27,163
He's in the back

588
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:31,448
and from what Broik says,
he's not coming out.

589
00:29:31,487 --> 00:29:34,587
Sounds like he's taking
Morn's death pretty hard.

590
00:29:34,629 --> 00:29:36,327
Uh-huh.
He loved the guy.

591
00:29:36,367 --> 00:29:40,333
Well, I better go test this.

592
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:42,042
I'll take over.

593
00:29:43,654 --> 00:29:45,853
Oh, good man.

594
00:30:02,072 --> 00:30:03,599
Anybody here?

595
00:30:05,783 --> 00:30:07,720
What a surprise.

596
00:30:07,754 --> 00:30:09,452
You got to help me, Quark.

597
00:30:09,493 --> 00:30:10,860
Someone's following me.

598
00:30:10,897 --> 00:30:11,866
Who?

599
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,302
Uh, two men.

600
00:30:13,337 --> 00:30:14,636
Brothers?

601
00:30:14,674 --> 00:30:16,372
Well, how should I know?

602
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:18,217
That could be them.

603
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:19,721
Don't answer it.

604
00:30:19,755 --> 00:30:22,227
Believe me, I'm not planning to.

605
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:26,164
Sounds like they're trying
to bypass the lock.

606
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:28,269
Come on.

607
00:30:32,824 --> 00:30:35,890
Computer, dim the lights.

608
00:30:37,437 --> 00:30:40,036
Remind me to invest
in a better lock.

609
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,016
Gentlemen.

610
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:58,392
Quark, we've been looking
all over for you.

611
00:30:58,429 --> 00:30:59,455
The latinum's on it's way.

612
00:30:59,499 --> 00:31:00,490
It'll be here tomorrow.

613
00:31:00,535 --> 00:31:03,007
That's good news.

614
00:31:03,042 --> 00:31:05,310
We were getting worried.

615
00:31:07,054 --> 00:31:09,322
Expecting anyone?

616
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,228
You never know
who's going to drop by.

617
00:31:11,265 --> 00:31:12,929
Don't answer it.

618
00:31:14,408 --> 00:31:16,573
Sounds like they're
coming in anyway.

619
00:31:16,614 --> 00:31:19,052
You should invest
in a better lock.

620
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:23,464
Whoever it is, get rid of them.

621
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:27,171
We'll be over there.

622
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,680
Um...

623
00:31:28,715 --> 00:31:31,952
you'd be more
comfortable in there.

624
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,940
We'll be back there.

625
00:31:47,734 --> 00:31:49,729
Why didn't you answer the door?

626
00:31:54,152 --> 00:31:55,451
Oh, I dozed off.

627
00:31:55,489 --> 00:31:57,518
It's been one of those days.

628
00:31:57,561 --> 00:31:58,894
We need to talk.

629
00:31:58,932 --> 00:32:00,995
What would we
need to talk about?

630
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:02,337
Are you all right?

631
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:05,612
What makes you ask that?

632
00:32:05,651 --> 00:32:08,454
Well, you keep
craning your neck.

633
00:32:08,525 --> 00:32:11,499
Well, look what we have here.

634
00:32:11,534 --> 00:32:13,699
I bet the Royal Family
sleeps soundly

635
00:32:13,739 --> 00:32:15,232
knowing you're on the job.

636
00:32:15,311 --> 00:32:17,179
Royal Family?

637
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:23,261
What kind of lies
you been telling him, Hain?

638
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,394
The usual.

639
00:32:25,439 --> 00:32:26,909
You know each other.

640
00:32:26,943 --> 00:32:28,607
It's been a long time.

641
00:32:28,648 --> 00:32:31,383
Nine years.

642
00:32:31,422 --> 00:32:35,126
You know, it must be
nine years.

643
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:37,468
I see you're still
a step behind everybody else.

644
00:32:38,376 --> 00:32:40,848
Leave him alone, Hain.

645
00:32:40,882 --> 00:32:43,583
Hey, it's Larell.

646
00:32:43,623 --> 00:32:46,027
I can see that.

647
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:47,796
What's going on here?

648
00:32:47,835 --> 00:32:50,901
We're, uh, having
a little reunion.

649
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,710
We used to work together...

650
00:32:52,749 --> 00:32:54,048
with Morn.

651
00:32:54,086 --> 00:32:57,687
I guess that means
he wasn't a prince after all.

652
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,063
No.

653
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,367
And you're not a security agent.

654
00:33:04,014 --> 00:33:05,450
And you're not
really his ex-wife.

655
00:33:07,423 --> 00:33:08,483
Please...
please don't tell me

656
00:33:08,526 --> 00:33:10,087
Morn didn't have any latinum.

657
00:33:10,131 --> 00:33:12,126
Oh, he had latinum, all right.

658
00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:13,696
At least that part is true.

659
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:16,271
Ever hear of the Lissepian
Mother's Day Heist?

660
00:33:16,315 --> 00:33:17,443
Who hasn't?

661
00:33:17,485 --> 00:33:19,353
While the entire world
was celebrating

662
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:21,054
someone broke
into the Central Bank

663
00:33:21,094 --> 00:33:22,085
and made off with...

664
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,667
1,000 bricks
of gold-pressed latinum.

665
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,615
Wait a minute.

666
00:33:31,657 --> 00:33:33,218
You expect me to believe

667
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:35,496
that the four of you
pulled that off?

668
00:33:35,535 --> 00:33:36,504
There was five of us.

669
00:33:36,538 --> 00:33:38,008
Morn helped.

670
00:33:38,042 --> 00:33:41,073
Yes, but then he ran
off with the latinum.

671
00:33:41,117 --> 00:33:43,419
Why did you take
so long to come after him?

672
00:33:43,458 --> 00:33:45,156
Because we knew
he'd stashed it away somewhere

673
00:33:45,196 --> 00:33:48,193
to wait for the statute
of limitations to expire.

674
00:33:48,237 --> 00:33:50,037
And it did, two weeks ago.

675
00:33:50,076 --> 00:33:52,641
You see, we can't be
prosecuted anymore.

676
00:33:52,683 --> 00:33:54,085
So here we are.

677
00:33:54,121 --> 00:33:56,320
The latinum's en route.

678
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,167
Maybe we should just split it up

679
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,674
and go our separate ways.

680
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:03,110
The voice of reason.

681
00:34:03,146 --> 00:34:04,810
Not you...

682
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,350
us.

683
00:34:07,391 --> 00:34:08,519
Krit's right.

684
00:34:08,561 --> 00:34:10,259
We don't need him anymore.

685
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,469
So what do we do with him?

686
00:34:24,505 --> 00:34:26,602
It should look like an accident.

687
00:34:26,645 --> 00:34:30,052
We don't want anyone
asking questions.

688
00:34:30,088 --> 00:34:31,057
Wait a minute.

689
00:34:31,091 --> 00:34:32,355
You can't kill me.

690
00:34:32,395 --> 00:34:35,198
I'm the only one who can take
delivery of the latinum.

691
00:34:35,236 --> 00:34:36,432
You need my thumbprint.

692
00:34:36,473 --> 00:34:39,072
If you stand still,
this won't hurt as much.

693
00:34:40,885 --> 00:34:41,945
Ah, ah, ah, wait a minute.

694
00:34:41,988 --> 00:34:44,426
What do you propose, Nahsk?

695
00:34:44,461 --> 00:34:47,162
That we walk into the cargo bay
with his bloody thumb

696
00:34:47,202 --> 00:34:48,797
and ask for the latinum?

697
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,367
We need him.

698
00:34:59,971 --> 00:35:01,839
The only question is

699
00:35:01,877 --> 00:35:04,510
what happens
after he takes delivery?

700
00:35:07,994 --> 00:35:11,094
We could split the latinum...
five ways.

701
00:35:11,136 --> 00:35:14,703
That is what you would have
gotten if Morn was still alive.

702
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:16,307
That's true.

703
00:35:16,384 --> 00:35:17,945
Think of me as Morn.

704
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:20,223
I can't believe
I just said that.

705
00:35:20,262 --> 00:35:21,231
This isn't fair.

706
00:35:21,264 --> 00:35:22,233
We stole it.

707
00:35:22,267 --> 00:35:23,931
He had nothing to do with it.

708
00:35:23,972 --> 00:35:27,243
Maybe not, but the bottom line
is you need me.

709
00:35:27,281 --> 00:35:30,484
A thousand bricks of latinum
split five ways...

710
00:35:33,766 --> 00:35:35,259
what do you think?

711
00:35:35,304 --> 00:35:38,677
It's still a lot of latinum.

712
00:35:38,713 --> 00:35:43,523
That's 250 bricks each.

713
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:46,158
So do we have a deal?

714
00:35:49,844 --> 00:35:51,405
All right.

715
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,849
Okay.

716
00:35:52,886 --> 00:35:55,553
The Bolian transport
arrives tomorrow at 1600.

717
00:35:55,593 --> 00:35:57,724
We'll meet at the cargo bay.

718
00:35:57,766 --> 00:35:59,361
We're staying together
until it gets here.

719
00:35:59,404 --> 00:36:00,430
We are?

720
00:36:00,507 --> 00:36:01,533
I don't trust you

721
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:03,172
and I certainly
don't trust them.

722
00:36:03,215 --> 00:36:04,479
I see your point.

723
00:36:05,688 --> 00:36:09,027
But I have a bar to run.

724
00:36:11,505 --> 00:36:12,496
All right.

725
00:36:17,756 --> 00:36:19,351
To your hospitality.

726
00:36:19,394 --> 00:36:20,761
Don't mention it.

727
00:36:25,276 --> 00:36:26,974
So this was Morn's
favorite place?

728
00:36:27,015 --> 00:36:29,419
He used to sit right there.

729
00:36:29,455 --> 00:36:31,757
Well, that's not very smart...

730
00:36:31,795 --> 00:36:34,233
sitting with your back
to the door.

731
00:36:34,269 --> 00:36:36,571
He was the trusting type.

732
00:36:37,845 --> 00:36:39,109
Which one of you
killed him anyway?

733
00:36:40,453 --> 00:36:41,649
It wasn't us.

734
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,459
Me neither.

735
00:36:46,503 --> 00:36:48,371
Don't look at me.

736
00:36:48,408 --> 00:36:51,177
Then it really was an accident.

737
00:36:52,954 --> 00:36:54,150
Poor Morny.

738
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:56,185
He always had such bad luck.

739
00:37:02,146 --> 00:37:03,878
Get rid of him.

740
00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:08,495
We're closed.

741
00:37:08,564 --> 00:37:10,432
At this hour?

742
00:37:12,843 --> 00:37:13,937
Friends of Morn.

743
00:37:13,979 --> 00:37:16,509
We're... commiserating.

744
00:37:16,554 --> 00:37:18,184
I see.

745
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:22,368
And how long are
you going to be closed?

746
00:37:22,403 --> 00:37:26,939
Oh, until about 1600 hours
tomorrow.

747
00:37:28,118 --> 00:37:30,785
We have a lot
to commiserate about.

748
00:37:30,826 --> 00:37:32,626
I see.

749
00:37:40,921 --> 00:37:42,916
Where were we?

750
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:52,111
There it is.

751
00:37:52,153 --> 00:37:53,452
Right on time.

752
00:37:55,863 --> 00:37:57,025
Uh...

753
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,538
I believe that's for me.

754
00:38:15,852 --> 00:38:18,347
Open it.

755
00:38:29,123 --> 00:38:31,357
Oh...

756
00:38:31,395 --> 00:38:33,629
I'll count it.

757
00:38:33,668 --> 00:38:35,070
Oh...

758
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:46,805
All right.

759
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:48,834
Somebody else count it.

760
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:50,542
Put it down, Hain.

761
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:52,646
My brother may be slow

762
00:38:52,688 --> 00:38:56,563
but if you pull that trigger,
he'll kill you.

763
00:38:57,769 --> 00:38:59,798
I'm not slow.

764
00:39:05,524 --> 00:39:07,496
Nahsk...

765
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,695
what are you doing?

766
00:39:11,106 --> 00:39:12,075
We're family.

767
00:39:12,109 --> 00:39:15,847
Just put the gun down.

768
00:39:29,592 --> 00:39:30,891
Go ahead.

769
00:39:30,929 --> 00:39:34,234
Kill each other.

770
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:35,604
Oh...

771
00:39:41,157 --> 00:39:43,356
Security. Drop your weapons.

772
00:39:43,396 --> 00:39:44,387
Huh?

773
00:39:45,436 --> 00:39:47,601
This is your last warning.

774
00:39:47,642 --> 00:39:49,135
I said drop them.

775
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,547
I surrender.

776
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,823
Take her to a holding cell.

777
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:56,661
Get the rest of them
to the Infirmary.

778
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:07,361
Ah, there you are.

779
00:40:07,398 --> 00:40:08,697
Are they gone?

780
00:40:08,734 --> 00:40:12,370
From now on,
you'll be commiserating alone.

781
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:15,079
All your "friends"
are going to prison.

782
00:40:15,118 --> 00:40:16,884
For how long?

783
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:19,361
Assault with intent to kill?

784
00:40:19,397 --> 00:40:20,867
Long enough.

785
00:40:20,902 --> 00:40:22,805
Then it's mine.

786
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,005
All mine.

787
00:40:26,717 --> 00:40:29,247
What you are about to hear

788
00:40:29,292 --> 00:40:33,760
is the most beautiful sound
in the galaxy.

789
00:40:38,317 --> 00:40:40,346
Oh, that can't be.

790
00:40:40,389 --> 00:40:42,418
There's no latinum
in these bricks.

791
00:40:42,462 --> 00:40:43,829
What?

792
00:40:43,866 --> 00:40:47,171
Someone's extracted
all the latinum!

793
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:50,205
There's nothing here
but worthless gold.

794
00:40:50,251 --> 00:40:52,485
And it's all yours.

795
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:56,993
No.

796
00:40:57,103 --> 00:41:01,046
No! No!

797
00:41:17,894 --> 00:41:20,459
Quark? Quark?

798
00:41:20,501 --> 00:41:22,301
What?

799
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,810
What do you want?

800
00:41:23,844 --> 00:41:26,443
There's someone here to see you.

801
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:28,923
I thought you said
they were all going to prison.

802
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:30,724
You'd better sit down.

803
00:41:33,772 --> 00:41:36,040
Morn?

804
00:41:36,145 --> 00:41:37,512
Alive and well.

805
00:41:37,549 --> 00:41:39,851
Apparently, he faked
his own death

806
00:41:39,889 --> 00:41:42,886
but I'll let him
tell you all about it.

807
00:41:49,917 --> 00:41:51,079
Well?

808
00:41:51,154 --> 00:41:52,350
No.

809
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:54,726
I don't want to hear it.

810
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:56,096
Not one word.

811
00:41:56,168 --> 00:41:58,163
You set me up.

812
00:42:01,817 --> 00:42:04,312
You left the latinum to me
because you knew I would do

813
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:06,226
whatever it would take
to get my hands on it.

814
00:42:06,262 --> 00:42:08,564
You figured I could
keep the four of them

815
00:42:08,602 --> 00:42:11,337
off-balance long enough for them
to turn on themselves.

816
00:42:11,377 --> 00:42:13,007
This whole thing was a scam

817
00:42:13,048 --> 00:42:15,247
to get them off your back,
wasn't it?

818
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,599
I could have been killed,
you know.

819
00:42:28,491 --> 00:42:31,522
And I thought we were friends.

820
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,080
I have to admit...

821
00:42:38,118 --> 00:42:41,024
I didn't suspect for a minute.

822
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,462
Tell you the truth

823
00:42:42,497 --> 00:42:45,494
I didn't think you had it in you
to pull off something like this.

824
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:47,169
I just have one question
for you.

825
00:42:47,277 --> 00:42:48,804
What happened to the latinum?

826
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:10,536
Of course.

827
00:43:10,576 --> 00:43:12,206
Your second stomach.

828
00:43:14,687 --> 00:43:17,661
You've been keeping it
in your second stomach

829
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:19,188
all these years?

830
00:43:21,439 --> 00:43:22,772
That's a lot of latinum.

831
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:24,474
No wonder your hair fell out.

832
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,669
For me?

833
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:40,582
That must be 100 bricks worth.

834
00:43:40,627 --> 00:43:43,396
I don't know what to say.

835
00:43:43,434 --> 00:43:44,801
Thanks.

836
00:43:44,838 --> 00:43:48,041
Not that I didn't earn it
after all you put me through.

837
00:43:49,685 --> 00:43:53,183
If you ever want to set
me up again, feel free.

838
00:43:56,872 --> 00:43:58,809
You know...

839
00:43:58,843 --> 00:44:02,718
you and I should consider
doing business together.

840
00:44:02,754 --> 00:44:05,854
Two enterprising gentlemen
like us

841
00:44:05,897 --> 00:44:08,564
could do all right
for ourselves.

842
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:12,775
Take that gold dust of yours...

843
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,913
it doesn't have to be
a total loss.

844
00:44:14,955 --> 00:44:17,291
I hear there's
some primitive cultures

845
00:44:17,362 --> 00:44:19,299
who consider it quite valuable.
