1
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:11,928
Morn, if you're not too busy,

2
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:15,765
I'd appreciate it if you did something
about that shipment of Livanian beets

3
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,726
you have sitting in Cargo Bay 3.

4
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:21,730
It's been there for over two weeks.
It's starting to rot.

5
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:26,735
Morn!

6
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,696
QUARK: It's a hologram.

7
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,033
Morn's been away on business
for the last two weeks.

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,203
You're slipping, Odo.
You should've caught on a lot sooner.

9
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:40,957
You replaced Morn with a hologram? Why?

10
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,709
-Evening.
-Hello, Morn.

11
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:43,960
QUARK: That's why.

12
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:46,880
People love him. He's like a mascot.

13
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,215
Everyone who comes in here
expects to see him

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,801
and if they don't,
it doesn't feel like home to them.

15
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,803
And that's not good for business.

16
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:59,225
The last time he went away,
my sales dropped almost five percent.

17
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:00,894
Oh.

18
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,688
Why doesn't it talk?

19
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:08,318
Do you have any idea how much
an interactive holo-projector costs?

20
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:14,074
Besides, it's a relief
not to have to listen to him go on.

21
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:19,704
You know Morn, he never shuts up.
I'd trade this for the real thing any day.

22
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sure Morn would be very touched
to hear you say that.

23
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,544
( gasping ) Morn!

24
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,379
No, it's just a hologram.

25
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,507
You look like you saw a ghost.

26
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,674
Turn it off.

27
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:32,967
Why?

28
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:36,638
We just got word. Morn's cargo ship
was caught in an ion storm.

29
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,014
Is he all right?

30
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,098
Was he rescued?

31
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:41,392
He's dead.

32
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,226
-Did you bring anything?
-Hmm?

33
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,185
To the memorial service?

34
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,853
I didn't know I was supposed to.

35
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,898
{\an8}Well, it's a Lurian custom to bring gifts
of food and drink for the deceased

36
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,067
{\an8}so they have something
to sustain them in the afterlife.

37
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,361
{\an8}Oh. Well, maybe I can get something
in Quark's.

38
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,696
{\an8}I hate to think
of the big fella going without.

39
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,324
{\an8}Morn was an excellent sparring partner.

40
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,118
{\an8}I will miss our weekly
combat in the holosuites.

41
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,912
{\an8}I can't believe he's really gone.

42
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,456
{\an8}I did not realize
he was such a close friend.

43
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,042
{\an8}Well, I used to have
a little crush on him.

44
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,127
{\an8}Morn?

45
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,589
{\an8}Well, it was before we met.
Besides, he wasn't interested.

46
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,508
{\an8}What do you mean he wasn't interested?

47
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,301
{\an8}DAX: Oh, forget I mentioned it.

48
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,469
{\an8}Is that a bottle opener?

49
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:24,681
{\an8}Hmm. For Morn.
I thought it might come in handy.

50
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,891
{\an8}-Very thoughtful.
-( chuckles )

51
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,564
{\an8}This is unbelievable.

52
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,276
{\an8}Look at all these people.

53
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:43,074
{\an8}If you see anyone empty-handed
sell them a bottle of Yridian ale.

54
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,994
{\an8}Tell them it was Morn's favorite.

55
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,958
{\an8}Very kind of you to do this, Quark.

56
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,252
{\an8}I'm sure Morn would've appreciated it.

57
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,670
{\an8}It's the least I could do.

58
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:57,880
{\an8}I'll miss him.

59
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,717
{\an8}Sorry.

60
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,927
Can I get you anything?

61
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:09,851
I don't ordinarily imbibe
on the job, but... maybe a Yridian ale.

62
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,394
It was Morn's favorite.

63
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:12,687
Oh.

64
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:13,896
Well, perfect.

65
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,367
What are you looking at?

66
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:30,163
Your respect for the dead is heartwarming.

67
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,956
I'll have you know

68
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,667
Morn died without paying
this month's bar tab.

69
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,629
Oh, how inconsiderate of him.

70
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,923
We're talking about a lot of money.

71
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,886
The man had quite an appetite.
You know he had two stomachs to fill.

72
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:49,515
Ever watch him eat?
It was a beautiful thing.

73
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:54,395
Well, sometimes you don't truly
appreciate what you have until it's gone.

74
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,816
It's nice to know you're so worried
about my welfare.

75
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,610
You should be worried, too.

76
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,614
Now that your mascot's gone,
business will suffer.

77
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,408
We'll see. You might be surprised.

78
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,329
-Jadzia.
-Can we please drop this?

79
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,749
QUARK: Everyone, thank you all for coming.

80
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,004
It means a great deal to me

81
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:23,925
to see so many people cared
about Morn as much as I did.

82
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,679
I'll never forget
the first time he walked in here

83
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,182
and sat down on that very stool.

84
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:38,147
It must've been... almost ten years ago.

85
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:41,943
He still had his hair then.

86
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:50,076
I thought he was just another
customer passing through.

87
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:57,667
Little did I know...
he'd become such an important figure

88
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:01,212
in my life... in all our lives.

89
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,883
Morn was always someone
we could count on for a cheerful smile,

90
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,261
and an entertaining story.

91
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:12,265
Some of you might be thinking
this place won't be the same without him.

92
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:15,977
And it won't.

93
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,648
But this was his home.

94
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,445
And wherever he is,
I'm sure he'd want to know

95
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:31,117
that his favorite bar still echoed
with the laughter of his dear friends.

96
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,914
This was his chair.

97
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,502
And I think the greatest tribute
we could ever pay him

98
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:45,089
would be to make sure
that it is never empty.

99
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,559
Keep it warm... for Morn.

100
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,534
Every now and then,
Quark really surprises me.

101
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,621
Me, too.

102
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:22,919
Excuse me, Quark.

103
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,504
Not now.

104
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:28,716
I'm sorry to intrude,
but I thought you should know.

105
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,551
I unsealed Morn's will.

106
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,138
He left everything to you.

107
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:38,976
Me? He left everything to me?

108
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,019
That's right.

109
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,606
Morn...

110
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,778
dear, sweet Morn.

111
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,530
Oh...

112
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:07,046
The poor fool actually believed
you cared about him.

113
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,005
I did.

114
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,258
I was up for hours
last night thinking about him.

115
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,885
Calculating his net worth, no doubt.

116
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,929
We spent a lot of time together, Odo.

117
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,056
We were obviously a lot closer
than I ever realized.

118
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,977
His financial records.

119
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,065
Is this some kind of joke?

120
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,108
What do you mean?

121
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,818
According to this, he was broke.

122
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,194
( sarcastically ) No.

123
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,321
How can that be?

124
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,448
He paid his bar bill
at the end of every month.

125
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,784
That kind of money
must have come from somewhere.

126
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,079
Well, he did have his shipping business.

127
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:44,083
Maybe all his assets
are tied up in inventory.

128
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,711
Of course. Inventory.

129
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:54,051
I'll unload everything,
and use the profits to...

130
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,805
-Oh, what's that smell?
-Your inheritance.

131
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,516
Livanian beets. Very ripe.

132
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,019
What's in the rest of these?

133
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,645
More beets.

134
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:08,524
That's it? That's all he had?

135
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,442
I'm afraid so.

136
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,776
( gasps )

137
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,658
Except for the contents of his quarters.
Maybe he spent all his money

138
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:22,246
-on furnishings and works of art.
<i>-Objets d'art.</i>

139
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,664
Of course.

140
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,626
<i>Objets d'art.</i> Of course.

141
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,712
I'll hold an auction.
People will pay a premium

142
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,631
to own something that used to be Morn's.

143
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,472
Are you sure these are the right quarters?

144
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,473
I'm sure.

145
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,308
Figures.

146
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,269
What's that?

147
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,439
That, I believe, is a matador.

148
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,275
No. That.

149
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,736
ODO: That's Morn's bed.

150
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,363
Morn slept in...

151
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,698
-mud? -Hmm.

152
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,951
I'm told it's excellent for the skin.

153
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,415
Thanks, Morn.

154
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,084
Just what I always wanted.

155
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:09,960
( gasping )

156
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,674
What are you doing in my mud?

157
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:21,097
Oh, I... I couldn't resist.
Morny and I had so many happy times here,

158
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:26,143
I just... I had to slip in.
I'm sorry if I startled you.

159
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,105
I heard you coming in
and I thought I'd better hide.

160
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,481
Who are you?

161
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,565
Um...

162
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,275
Larell.

163
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,570
Morn's wife. Well, ex-wife.

164
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,114
Morn was married?

165
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:39,698
To you?

166
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,700
For two wonderful years.

167
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,745
You must be Quark.

168
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:48,124
Morny and I kept in touch
after we were separated.

169
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,877
He talked about you all the time.

170
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,463
That's nice.

171
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,800
He told me that if anything
ever happened to him,

172
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,928
he wanted you to have everything
that was ever his.

173
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,681
Everything?

174
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,642
Everything.

175
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,355
Well, I'm glad you came by,

176
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,818
because Morny didn't leave
me much of anything else.

177
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,195
Why, I find that hard to believe.

178
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,196
( laughs )

179
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,533
I'm as disappointed as you are.

180
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,118
I happen to know

181
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:28,038
that he had quite
a substantial retirement fund,

182
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,833
one that could make two people
very comfortable.

183
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:37,214
If you're partial to mud,
it's comfortable, all right.

184
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,759
I'm talking about the thousand bricks
of gold-pressed latinum

185
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,970
that he won in the Lissepian Lottery.

186
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,306
A thousand bricks?

187
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:50,144
Mm-hmm. Now that he's gone, it's all ours.

188
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:05,075
( vacuum slurping )

189
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,380
What are you doing?

190
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,509
What do you think?
I'm looking for the latinum.

191
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,803
You must know where he kept it.

192
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:29,225
I didn't even know it existed
until you told me.

193
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:36,232
Well, I'm sure it's somewhere
on the station.

194
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,400
How do we know he didn't spend it already?

195
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,278
I told you, it was for his retirement.

196
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:45,574
Poor Morn.
He never got a chance to enjoy it.

197
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,118
But that doesn't mean we can't.

198
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,996
I know what you're doing.

199
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,707
What am I doing?

200
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,502
Just so we're clear...

201
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,921
the latinum's mine.

202
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:04,552
He may have left everything to you,
but I was his wife.

203
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:09,014
I could contest the will,
and tie you up in court for years.

204
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,516
Maybe.

205
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,186
But there's no reason
it has to come to that.

206
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,022
After all, a thousand bricks is plenty
for both of us.

207
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,942
It is a lot of money.

208
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:27,950
And as soon as we find it,
we'll take a nice long vacation together.

209
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,662
Morn would have wanted it that way.

210
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,914
Of course, he would have.

211
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,843
The latinum's not on the station.
I looked everywhere. Evade.

212
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,555
I even had my brother scan for it
with the internal sensors.

213
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,098
Well, at least you have the painting.

214
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,018
Oh, forget the painting.
I want that latinum.

215
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:55,978
If you think it'll make you happy.

216
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:56,979
Confront.

217
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,898
Believe me, it will.

218
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,277
This is the break I've been waiting for,

219
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,696
and it's been a long time in coming.

220
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,366
I want Morn's money. I need Morn's money.

221
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,577
I deserve Morn's money.

222
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,330
Your move.

223
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:21,295
Beautiful, isn't it?
And the way it picks up the light.

224
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,925
I wonder who came up with the idea
of suspending liquid latinum

225
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,843
inside worthless bits of gold?

226
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,387
Probably someone who got
tired of making change

227
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,555
with an eyedropper.

228
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,098
Are you going to play or not?

229
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,854
Where do you think Morn put it all?

230
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,566
If you find it, are you really
going to share it with this woman?

231
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,778
I agreed to pay her ten percent
so she wouldn't tie me up in court.

232
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:46,862
That's 100 bricks.

233
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,530
What could I do?

234
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,615
Retreat.

235
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,787
I don't know, but there's something
I don't like about this whole thing.

236
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:56,997
I don't trust this woman.

237
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,837
Neither do I, but... that doesn't mean

238
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:04,964
I'm going to keep her away from my lobes.

239
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,634
Just keep your eyes open.
Don't be fooled by a pretty face.

240
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,010
Not me.

241
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,930
Of course not. Acquire.

242
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,613
Oh...

243
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:34,284
What a pleasant surprise.

244
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,708
Computer, lights.

245
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:46,171
Tell me... you like surprises, Quark?

246
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,173
Only pleasant ones.

247
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,010
I like to think I'm pleasant.

248
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,846
-You think I'm pleasant?
-Absolutely.

249
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:58,851
Then I guess this qualifies
as a pleasant surprise.

250
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,644
What are you doing in my quarters?

251
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:01,729
Waiting for you.

252
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:07,609
My brother and I were business
associates of Morn's.

253
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:11,155
If you've come for the memorial service,
it was yesterday.

254
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,032
Really? Was it nice?

255
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,992
It was lovely.

256
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,954
I understand you inherited Morn's estate.

257
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,456
That's right.

258
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:24,126
We're business associates of Morn's.

259
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,544
Your brother mentioned that.

260
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,965
He... borrowed some money from us,

261
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:35,220
and we'd like the estate
to repay the loan.

262
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,597
Uh-huh.

263
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,433
How much money are we talking about?

264
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,018
Oh...

265
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:46,523
One thousand bricks
of gold-pressed latinum.

266
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,193
I had a feeling
you were going to say that.

267
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,239
I need to see documentation
regarding this loan.

268
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,702
We shook hands.

269
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,788
We trusted Morn.

270
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:07,836
And I'm sure he'd want you...
to honor his word.

271
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:13,717
I'm sure he would,
but you have to understand,

272
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:17,554
Morn's assets are all tied up
in various enterprises.

273
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:23,393
I hope you're not saying
you don't have the money.

274
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,854
That wouldn't be good.

275
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:31,276
Uh... all I meant was it'll take me
a little while to get it.

276
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,488
-So you do know where it is.
-QUARK: Of course.

277
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,742
You're not the first creditors
to make a claim against his estate.

278
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,202
We're not?

279
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,414
Morn was expanding his business interests
when he died.

280
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,584
His resources were stretched
somewhat thin.

281
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:52,673
As a result, the claims against the estate
are greater than the assets.

282
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,177
Obviously, you can't expect
full repayment.

283
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,846
What can we expect?

284
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,013
A percentage.

285
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,014
What sort of percentage?

286
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,015
Twenty.

287
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,350
We can't accept less than 80.

288
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,601
I'll make it 30,

289
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,104
and I'll throw in a shipment
of Livanian beets.

290
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,230
I don't like beets.

291
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,523
We'll take 70.

292
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:10,440
Forty.

293
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,360
And because I can see
you both have fine taste,

294
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,529
I'm willing to part with this.

295
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,615
One of Morn's most treasured possessions.

296
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,409
Beautiful, isn't it?

297
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,619
Very nice.

298
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,996
We can't take less than 60.

299
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,414
Forty's the best I can do.

300
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,331
-Fifty.
-Sorry.

301
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,670
Fifty it is.

302
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:36,300
I'm glad we could come
to an understanding.

303
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:37,885
Me, too.

304
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,094
( laughs )

305
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,933
We'll be watching you, Quark.

306
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,477
Don't try anything.

307
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,022
Me? Don't be ridiculous.

308
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,748
What do we have here?

309
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,255
Computer, what is this?

310
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,718
COMPUTER: <i>A claim slip </i>
<i>for Storage Locker 137,</i>

311
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,929
<i>located in the Station Assay Office.</i>

312
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,431
A storage locker!

313
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,143
Thank you, computer.
You've been very helpful.

314
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:35,150
Morn, wherever you are, I love you!

315
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,864
What do you mean
I have to open it in here?

316
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,409
Regulations, the contents
of a deceased person's storage locker

317
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,079
have to be inspected by station security.

318
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,748
There's no such regulation.
You just want to know what's inside.

319
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,709
You are so transparent.
I can't wait to see your face

320
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:57,673
when your deputies wheel
in my thousand bricks of latinum.

321
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,176
Ah, here we are. Thank you.

322
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,095
That can't be it.

323
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,765
Storage Locker 137.

324
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,272
Well... sometimes,
good things come in small packages.

325
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,776
Hmm...

326
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,947
will that be enough
to cover Morn's bar tab?

327
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:25,701
It's covered.

328
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,328
There's more where this came from.

329
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:29,997
What makes you say that?

330
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,039
Take a look.

331
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,752
On the bottom.

332
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,381
Recognize Morn's handwriting?

333
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,593
"The rest is in the Bank of Bolias."

334
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,263
Account number C-J-5-74-36.

335
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:47,597
Hmph.

336
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:51,226
This wasn't in Morn's financial record.

337
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,352
Who cares?

338
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:57,149
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to contact the bank

339
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,401
and let them know Morn's legal heir

340
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,820
would like his latinum delivered
as soon as possible.

341
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,543
Larell...

342
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,962
I've been looking all over for you.

343
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,506
I'm a busy man.

344
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,176
Not too busy to look
for a certain something, I hope.

345
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,887
Actually I haven't had much
luck with that.

346
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:29,306
Sounds like you need a little motivation.

347
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,640
Oh...

348
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,186
I'm motivated, believe me.

349
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:39,399
It's just that it's going to take some
time to locate, that's all.

350
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:40,942
Mm-hmm.

351
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,988
Um... I have an idea.

352
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:49,076
Why don't you go back
to wherever you come from,

353
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,412
and I'll contact you as soon as I find it?

354
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,041
I think I'd rather wait here... with you.

355
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,669
Oh...

356
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,423
this is not a good time for <i>oo-mox.</i>

357
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,383
Why? Don't you like it?

358
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:10,472
Uh, it's not that. It's just that...

359
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:14,226
the sooner I find
that certain something...

360
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,143
Mmm...

361
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,897
the sooner we can take
our little trip together.

362
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,191
Mm, you're so diligent.

363
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,402
Most men don't know
how to defer gratification.

364
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,613
You don't make it easy.

365
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:27,739
Mm.

366
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,338
Good morning.

367
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:48,552
( drumming on doors )

368
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,431
Level 17.

369
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,309
( sighs )

370
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,064
You're good.

371
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:07,237
But... I'm the only one
the bank's going to give the money to.

372
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,489
Yeah.

373
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,368
C-J-5-74-36.

374
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:15,412
C-J-5-74... uh...

375
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,414
This is my stop.

376
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,040
What's your hurry?

377
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,752
My brother has something
he wants to say to you.

378
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,755
I'm sorry.

379
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,260
About the painting.

380
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,429
He feels terrible.

381
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:33,597
No hard feelings.

382
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:37,184
That's nice of you
to be so forgiving, Quark.

383
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,351
Don't mention it.

384
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,980
-My brother has a nasty temper.
-I get upset.

385
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,399
It comes out when things don't go our way.

386
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:48,486
I noticed. That's why I'm hoping
things start to go our way soon.

387
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,448
Do you understand what I'm saying, Quark?

388
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:52,616
I think I do, yes.

389
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,242
I don't like to get upset.

390
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,287
Don't worry.
Things are going to go your way soon.

391
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,414
That's good to hear.

392
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,585
I'll keep in touch.

393
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,422
I really am sorry about the painting.

394
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:20,101
C-J-5-74-36. C-J-5-74-36.

395
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,568
Bank of Bolias.

396
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:35,492
HAIN: Making a withdrawal, Quark?
Let me guess.

397
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,787
A thousand bricks of gold-pressed latinum.

398
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,046
Put your hands on your head.

399
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:52,717
Turn around.

400
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,514
All right, how much do you want?

401
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:01,309
And don't ask for the full 1,000 bricks.
I already gave away more than half of it.

402
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:04,813
Attempted bribery. That should add
a few years to your sentence.

403
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,773
-What are you talking about?
-Let's go.

404
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,442
Go? Wait, who are you?

405
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,445
Lurian Security. I have a signed
extradition order for your arrest.

406
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,531
-Oh.
-As soon as your station's

407
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:17,492
security chief approves it...
we'll be on our way.

408
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,245
What did I do? What's the charge?

409
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,580
Conspiracy to intercept
government property.

410
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,873
Government property?

411
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,792
1,000 bricks of gold-pressed latinum.

412
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:26,876
Wait a minute.

413
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:30,297
Morn won that latinum
in the Lissepian Lottery.

414
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:33,842
He didn't?

415
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,220
It was his bequest
from the Royal Family of Luria.

416
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:38,596
Oh...

417
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:43,101
Why would the Royal Family of Luria
give Morn that kind of money?

418
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,602
He was the crown prince.

419
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,022
Morn was a prince?

420
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,481
You didn't know?

421
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:50,734
Morn was a prince?

422
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,068
That's what I'm saying.

423
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,864
-Morn was a prince.
-Yes.

424
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,450
But he renounced the throne
when he came of age.

425
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,285
Well, I always knew he was an idiot.

426
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,455
His family bequeathed him the latinum
when he abdicated.

427
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,875
But now that he's deceased,
it's legally theirs again.

428
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:08,376
Uh-uh.

429
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:10,462
He left it to me.

430
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,465
That will has already been nullified.

431
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,426
He signed an agreement to return
the latinum in the event of his death.

432
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:18,553
Oh.

433
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,977
Do me a favor. Don't tell his ex-wife.

434
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,480
I'm going to need a little <i>oo-mox later.</i>

435
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:29,856
His ex-wife?

436
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:30,982
Larell.

437
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,442
She's here?

438
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,361
Mm-hmm. I just saw her.

439
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,699
-Is something wrong?
-Quiet!

440
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,534
Let me think.

441
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:49,250
Listen and listen carefully.
Larell has been trying

442
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,544
to get her hands on the prince's
latinum for years.

443
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,422
She's tried blackmail, extortion.

444
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,092
I wouldn't be surprised
if she was behind his death.

445
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,718
She's always been nice to me.

446
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,764
The Royal Family would like nothing better
than to see her behind bars.

447
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:08,895
If you help me apprehend her,
there'll be a substantial reward.

448
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,480
What do I have to do?

449
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:11,981
When are you going to see her again?

450
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,527
She'll turn up sooner or later.
If not her, then those two brothers.

451
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,153
Brothers?

452
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,489
They said they
were Morn's business partners.

453
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,283
They claimed he owed them money.

454
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,786
Something tells me
they were not exactly aboveboard.

455
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:29,749
Whoever these brothers are I promise you,
I won't let them get

456
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,960
between the Royal Family and its latinum.

457
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:34,671
And I won't let anything get between me
and my reward.

458
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:35,713
Do we have an understanding?

459
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:39,008
-Uh-huh.
-If I'm going to put these people away

460
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,594
I have to catch them trying
to get their hands on the latinum.

461
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,013
Call the bank.

462
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,683
Tell them to deliver it here.

463
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:47,600
Then what?

464
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,396
You stay out of sight
and leave the rest to me.

465
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,573
What are you up to?

466
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,701
Trying to fix this optronic relay.

467
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,329
Wouldn't you be better
off working in a lab?

468
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,499
I'm keeping Morn's chair warm.

469
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:12,625
Ah.

470
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:13,793
Good man.

471
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,006
Where's Quark?

472
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,342
I'm in the mood
for one of his famous Til'amin froths.

473
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,219
You'll have to settle for something else.

474
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,763
He's in the back,

475
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:28,516
and from what Broik says,
he's not coming out.

476
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,728
Sounds like he's taking
Morn's death pretty hard.

477
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,980
Uh-huh. He loved the guy.

478
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,984
Well, I better go test this.

479
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:39,778
I'll take over.

480
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,198
Oh, good man.

481
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:00,965
Anybody here?

482
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,136
What a surprise.

483
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:08,056
You got to help me, Quark.
Someone's following me.

484
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:08,973
Who?

485
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,433
Uh, two men.

486
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,351
Brothers?

487
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:13,645
Well, how should I know?

488
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,688
-( door chimes )
-That could be them.

489
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,065
Don't answer it.

490
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,859
Believe me, I'm not planning to.

491
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,736
( lock beeping )

492
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,822
Sounds like they're trying
to bypass the lock.

493
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:25,949
Come on.

494
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,997
Computer, dim the lights.

495
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,707
( beeping )

496
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,626
Remind me to invest in a better lock.

497
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,170
( door opening )

498
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,224
QUARK: Gentlemen.

499
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:55,478
Quark, we've been looking
all over for you.

500
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:58,106
The latinum's on its way.
It'll be here tomorrow.

501
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,316
That's good news.

502
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,652
We were getting worried.

503
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,445
( door chimes )

504
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:06,948
Expecting anyone?

505
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,825
You never know who's going to drop by.

506
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:09,868
Don't answer it.

507
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,995
( lock beeping )

508
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,913
Sounds like they're coming in anyway.

509
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,374
You should invest in a better lock.

510
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,879
Whoever it is, get rid of them.

511
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,798
We'll be over there.

512
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:25,550
Um...

513
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:29,137
you'd be more comfortable in there.

514
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,435
We'll be back there.

515
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,155
Why didn't you answer the door?

516
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:54,495
Oh, I dozed off.
It's been one of those days.

517
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,747
We need to talk.

518
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,540
What would we need to talk about?

519
00:31:58,791 --> 00:31:59,626
Are you all right?

520
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,128
What makes you ask that?

521
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,131
Well, you keep craning your neck.

522
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,093
Well, look what we have here.

523
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:12,472
I bet the Royal Family sleeps soundly
knowing you're on the job.

524
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,223
Royal Family?

525
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:20,521
What kind of lies
you been telling him, Hain?

526
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:21,689
The usual.

527
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:23,942
You know each other.

528
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,027
It's been a long time.

529
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,154
Nine years.

530
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:32,283
You know, it must be nine years.

531
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,869
I see you're still
a step behind everybody else.

532
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,330
Leave him alone, Hain.

533
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,833
Hey, it's Larell.

534
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,002
I can see that.

535
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:44,796
What's going on here?

536
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:49,133
We're, uh, having a little reunion.
We used to work together...

537
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,010
with Morn.

538
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,639
I guess that means
he wasn't a prince after all.

539
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:56,599
No.

540
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,768
And you're not a security agent.

541
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:02,647
And you're not really his ex-wife.

542
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,360
Please... please don't tell me
Morn didn't have any latinum.

543
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,404
Oh, he had latinum, all right.

544
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:10,863
At least that part is true.

545
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,491
Ever hear of the Lissepian
Mother's Day Heist?

546
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,701
Who hasn't?

547
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,869
While the entire world was celebrating,

548
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,205
someone broke into the Central Bank
and made off with...

549
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,376
One thousand bricks
of gold-pressed latinum.

550
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:28,548
Wait a minute.

551
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:32,510
You expect me to believe
that the four of you pulled that off?

552
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,846
There was five of us. Morn helped.

553
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,807
Yes, but then he ran off with the latinum.

554
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,309
Why did you take
so long to come after him?

555
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,770
Because we knew he'd stashed it
away somewhere

556
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,106
to wait for the statute
of limitations to expire.

557
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:46,899
And it did, two weeks ago.

558
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,527
You see, we can't be prosecuted anymore.

559
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,362
So here we are.

560
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:52,989
The latinum's en route.

561
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:58,619
Maybe we should just split it up
and go our separate ways.

562
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,121
The voice of reason.

563
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,289
Not you...

564
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,126
us.

565
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,170
Krit's right. We don't need him anymore.

566
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,142
So what do we do with him?

567
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,186
KRIT: It should look like an accident.

568
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,189
We don't want anyone asking questions.

569
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,983
Wait a minute. You can't kill me.

570
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,319
I'm the only one who can take
delivery of the latinum.

571
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:32,862
You need my thumb print.

572
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:36,032
If you stand still,
this won't hurt as much.

573
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:36,991
( screaming )

574
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,576
HAIN: Ah, ah, ah, wait a minute.

575
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,037
What do you propose, Nahsk?

576
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,956
That we walk into the Cargo Bay
with his bloody thumb,

577
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,374
and ask for the latinum?

578
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:46,793
We need him.

579
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:01,099
The only question is,
what happens after he takes delivery?

580
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:08,064
We could split the latinum... five ways.

581
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,192
That is what you would
have gotten if Morn was still alive.

582
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,193
That's true.

583
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,695
Think of me as Morn.

584
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,656
I can't believe I just said that.

585
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,033
This isn't fair. We stole it.

586
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,284
He had nothing to do with it.

587
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,120
Maybe not, but the bottom line
is you need me.

588
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,916
A thousand bricks of latinum
split five ways...

589
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:31,712
what do you think?

590
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,841
It's still a lot of latinum.

591
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:39,470
That's 250 bricks each.

592
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,348
So do we have a deal?

593
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,896
-All right.
-OK.

594
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:52,233
The Bolian transport
arrives tomorrow at 1600.

595
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:53,985
We'll meet at the cargo bay.

596
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,778
We're staying together until it gets here.

597
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:56,904
We are?

598
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,574
I don't trust you, and I certainly
don't trust them.

599
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,033
I see your point.

600
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:05,121
But I have a bar to run.

601
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,041
All right.

602
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,590
To your hospitality.

603
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,091
Don't mention it.

604
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,055
So this was Morn's favorite place?

605
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,516
He used to sit right there.

606
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:30,605
Well, that's not very smart
sitting with your back to the door.

607
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,523
He was the trusting type.

608
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,484
Which one of you killed him anyway?

609
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,154
It wasn't us.

610
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:41,908
Me neither.

611
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:44,452
Don't look at me.

612
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,163
Then it really was an accident.

613
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:52,543
Poor Morny. He always had such bad luck.

614
00:36:58,883 --> 00:36:59,800
Get rid of him.

615
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,388
We're closed.

616
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,724
At this hour?

617
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,061
Friends of Morn.

618
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,772
We're... commiserating.

619
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,232
I see.

620
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,611
And how long are you going to be closed?

621
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:23,074
Oh, until about 1600 hours tomorrow.

622
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,702
We have a lot to commiserate about.

623
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,080
I see.

624
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,464
Where were we?

625
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,224
There it is.

626
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:49,809
Right on time.

627
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:52,979
Uh...

628
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,398
I believe that's for me.

629
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,457
Open it.

630
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,679
Oh...

631
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,515
I'll count it.

632
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:30,891
Oh...

633
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,611
All right.

634
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,947
Somebody else count it.

635
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:50,619
Put it down, Hain. My brother may be slow,
but if you pull that trigger,

636
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,621
he'll kill you.

637
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,042
I'm not slow.

638
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,132
Nahsk...

639
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,801
what are you doing?

640
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,262
We're family.

641
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,474
Just put the gun down.

642
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,153
( weapons fire continues )

643
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:26,989
Go ahead.

644
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,492
Kill each other.

645
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,827
Oh...

646
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:37,249
( gasps )

647
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,585
ODO: Security. Drop your weapons.

648
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,587
-Huh?
-( weapons fire continues )

649
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,799
ODO: This is your last warning.
I said drop them.

650
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:45,925
( weapon clatters to ground )

651
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,009
LARELL: I surrender.

652
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,930
Take her to a holding cell.

653
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,723
Get the rest of them to the Infirmary.

654
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:03,150
Ah, there you are.

655
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,485
Are they gone?

656
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:07,988
From now on,
you'll be commiserating alone.

657
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,866
All your "friends" are going to prison.

658
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,618
For how long?

659
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,454
Assault with intent to kill?

660
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,455
Long enough.

661
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,999
Then it's mine.

662
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,960
All mine.

663
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,005
What you are about to hear

664
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:29,009
is the most beautiful sound in the galaxy.

665
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,016
Oh, that can't be.

666
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,477
There's no latinum in these bricks.

667
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,478
What?

668
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:43,399
Someone's extracted all the latinum!

669
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,193
There's nothing here but worthless gold.

670
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,529
And it's all yours.

671
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,072
( chuckling )

672
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,117
No.

673
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:56,912
No! No!

674
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,013
( grunting )

675
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:16,515
Quark? Quark?

676
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,433
What?

677
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,685
What do you want?

678
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,729
There's someone here to see you.

679
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,690
I thought you said
they were all going to prison.

680
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:26,233
You'd better sit down.

681
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,071
Morn?

682
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,656
Alive and well.

683
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,743
Apparently, he faked his own death,

684
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,454
but I'll let him tell you all about it.

685
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:46,879
Well?

686
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:47,922
No.

687
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,965
I don't want to hear it.

688
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:51,675
Not one word.

689
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,636
You set me up.

690
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,934
You left the latinum to me
because you knew I would do

691
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,186
whatever it would take
to get my hands on it.

692
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,230
You figured I could keep the four of them

693
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,941
off-balance long enough for them
to turn on themselves.

694
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:10,861
This whole thing was a scam
to get them off your back, wasn't it?

695
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,700
I could have been killed, you know.

696
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,169
And I thought we were friends.

697
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,592
I have to admit...

698
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,470
I didn't suspect for a minute.

699
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,013
Tell you the truth,

700
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:41,058
I didn't think you had it in you
to pull off something like this.

701
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:42,851
I just have one question for you.

702
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,144
What happened to the latinum?

703
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,743
( gurgling burp )

704
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:08,002
Of course. Your second stomach.

705
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:13,257
You've been keeping it
in your second stomach

706
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,967
all these years?

707
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,387
That's a lot of latinum.

708
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,055
No wonder your hair fell out.

709
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,022
For me?

710
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:38,616
That must be 100 bricks worth.
I don't know what to say.

711
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:40,409
Thanks.

712
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,037
Not that I didn't earn it
after all you put me through.

713
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,876
If you ever want to set
me up again, feel free.

714
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,464
You know...

715
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:58,218
you and I should consider
doing business together.

716
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:01,138
Two enterprising gentlemen like us

717
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:06,518
could do all right for ourselves.
Take that gold dust of yours...

718
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,147
it doesn't have to be a total loss.

719
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,399
I hear there's some primitive cultures

720
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,234
who consider it quite valuable.
