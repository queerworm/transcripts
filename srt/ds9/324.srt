1
00:00:04,868 --> 00:00:06,838
Got you this time, Chief.

2
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:20,829
Sorry, Commander.

3
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,169
Don't apologize.

4
00:00:22,206 --> 00:00:23,903
That just makes it worse.

5
00:00:23,943 --> 00:00:26,346
I guess I'm just
in the zone today.

6
00:00:26,382 --> 00:00:27,715
"In the zone"?

7
00:00:27,751 --> 00:00:29,812
The feeling
that I can't lose...

8
00:00:29,856 --> 00:00:32,852
that I can put the dart
exactly where I want it.

9
00:00:32,896 --> 00:00:34,525
You know the feeling.

10
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:36,092
Not today.

11
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:37,435
Dax to Sisko.

12
00:00:37,473 --> 00:00:38,942
Go ahead.

13
00:00:38,976 --> 00:00:40,969
Benjamin, there's
a priority message for you

14
00:00:41,014 --> 00:00:42,745
from the Bajoran
Provisional Government.

15
00:00:42,784 --> 00:00:44,253
On my way.

16
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,256
Hmm.

17
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,554
Fortunately, duty calls.

18
00:00:47,962 --> 00:00:50,058
You'll have to find
yourself another victim.

19
00:00:53,174 --> 00:00:54,643
Doctor.

20
00:00:54,678 --> 00:00:57,115
Commander, um,
is Chief O'Brien in here?

21
00:00:57,149 --> 00:00:59,985
He's back there...
"in the zone."

22
00:01:02,728 --> 00:01:07,193
<i>Raka-ja ut shala morala</i>

23
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:13,584
<i>ema bo roo kana</i>
<i>uranak ralanon Bareil</i>

24
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,993

25
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,833
Enter.

26
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:25,170
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:26,976
I... I didn't
mean to interrupt.

28
00:01:27,015 --> 00:01:28,575
Oh, that's all right.

29
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:30,281
It's called a <i>duranja.</i>

30
00:01:30,322 --> 00:01:32,087
It's a lamp for the dead.

31
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:34,427
I was just...
praying for Bareil.

32
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,093
What can I do for you?

33
00:01:36,135 --> 00:01:39,131
This may come
as somewhat of a shock

34
00:01:39,175 --> 00:01:41,806
but I wanted you
to hear it from me.

35
00:01:41,847 --> 00:01:43,316
The First Minister

36
00:01:43,384 --> 00:01:45,787
of the provisional
government has died.

37
00:01:45,823 --> 00:01:48,556
Kalem Apren... how?

38
00:01:48,596 --> 00:01:51,569
Heart failure.
He died in his sleep.

39
00:01:51,603 --> 00:01:53,334
Ah...

40
00:01:53,373 --> 00:01:55,343
Well, I just met him once

41
00:01:55,377 --> 00:01:57,974
but he seemed like
he was a good man.

42
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:01,251
How soon will they appoint
someone to replace him?

43
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,752
They have already
appointed someone.

44
00:02:04,798 --> 00:02:07,771
The new head of the
provisional government

45
00:02:07,804 --> 00:02:10,902
is Kai Winn.

46
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:22,576
...so, as a result,
I've transferred Ensign Palmers

47
00:04:22,618 --> 00:04:24,520
back to the night watch

48
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,083
and reassigned Crewman
Donark to the <i>Defiant</i>

49
00:04:27,127 --> 00:04:29,223
as a member
of the security detachment.

50
00:04:30,568 --> 00:04:33,199
Starfleet is sending
a series of upgrades

51
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,110
for our tactical computer
modules next week.

52
00:04:36,147 --> 00:04:39,086
I've drawn up a plan
to phase in the upgrades

53
00:04:39,121 --> 00:04:41,182
over the course of three days.

54
00:04:41,225 --> 00:04:43,195
Major...

55
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:44,698
is something wrong?

56
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:47,800
Yes.

57
00:04:49,744 --> 00:04:52,079
Oh, it's this whole thing
with Kai Winn.

58
00:04:52,116 --> 00:04:54,451
I was just trying
to get used to her

59
00:04:54,488 --> 00:04:56,390
as spiritual leader of Bajor

60
00:04:56,425 --> 00:04:58,828
and now she's running
the government, Odo?

61
00:04:58,864 --> 00:05:00,766
Not an ideal situation.

62
00:05:00,802 --> 00:05:02,795
Well, I'm beginning
to think you and I

63
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:05,106
are the only ones
who feel that way.

64
00:05:05,145 --> 00:05:07,844
No one is opposing her
in next month's elections.

65
00:05:07,884 --> 00:05:10,378
She is going to be
elected the First Minister

66
00:05:10,423 --> 00:05:13,988
for the next six years,
and no one seems to care.

67
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,869
Well, you and I have
a different perspective

68
00:05:17,906 --> 00:05:19,569
than most Bajorans.

69
00:05:19,609 --> 00:05:22,582
There's a personal element
to our feelings about her.

70
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,327
I know that you still blame Winn
for Bareil's death.

71
00:05:30,835 --> 00:05:33,238
That's part of it...

72
00:05:33,272 --> 00:05:37,304
but this is
about the future of Bajor.

73
00:05:37,348 --> 00:05:38,908
I can't shake the feeling

74
00:05:38,952 --> 00:05:42,517
that giving Winn control
of the government is a mistake...

75
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,861
that she should be stopped.

76
00:05:44,898 --> 00:05:47,837
Stopped from doing what?

77
00:05:47,872 --> 00:05:49,535
I don't know.

78
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:56,350
Maybe... maybe I'm afraid...

79
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:01,732
that if she's given power,
she's never going to let it go.

80
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:03,568
Unfortunately, that suspicion

81
00:06:03,606 --> 00:06:05,941
is not shared
by the people of Bajor.

82
00:06:05,978 --> 00:06:07,811
They still admire her

83
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:11,118
as the woman who made peace
with Cardassia.

84
00:06:11,156 --> 00:06:13,457
Bareil made peace
with Cardassia.

85
00:06:13,495 --> 00:06:15,192
I know that, Major

86
00:06:15,232 --> 00:06:18,672
but to the rest of Bajor,
Winn is the real hero.

87
00:06:18,706 --> 00:06:22,111
In their eyes, it took courage
to conclude a treaty

88
00:06:22,147 --> 00:06:24,083
with a race that she herself

89
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:27,181
had so bitterly condemned
and fought against.

90
00:06:27,225 --> 00:06:29,719
I don't care
what her popular image is.

91
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,299
She is no hero.

92
00:06:31,334 --> 00:06:34,273
The only thing that she cares
about is her own power.

93
00:06:34,307 --> 00:06:36,368
Why can't people see that?

94
00:06:38,984 --> 00:06:42,389
We spent so many years
fighting the Cardassians.

95
00:06:42,424 --> 00:06:44,394
We spent so much time

96
00:06:44,429 --> 00:06:47,664
hoping and praying
for a Bajor that was free.

97
00:06:47,703 --> 00:06:49,332
Now that we won

98
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:52,438
how can people just hand over
their freedom

99
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,143
to someone like Winn?

100
00:06:54,183 --> 00:06:56,085
It has been my observation

101
00:06:56,122 --> 00:06:59,721
that one of the prices of giving
people freedom of choice

102
00:06:59,763 --> 00:07:02,827
is that, sometimes,
they make the wrong choice.

103
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:15,129
<i>... bo roo kana uranak</i>
<i>ralanon Bareil</i>

105
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:23,344
Yes?

106
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:26,822
Hello, child.

107
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,935
Eminence.

108
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:32,065
May I come in?

109
00:07:32,141 --> 00:07:34,043
Yes.

110
00:07:36,985 --> 00:07:38,978
Please forgive this intrusion.

111
00:07:39,022 --> 00:07:40,753
I know the hour is late.

112
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,629
Does Commander Sisko know
you're aboard the station?

113
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,659
I'm not here
to see the Emissary.

114
00:07:45,704 --> 00:07:47,003
I'm here to see you.

115
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,269
Me?

116
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:49,608
Yes, child.

117
00:07:49,646 --> 00:07:52,117
Have you suffered a recent loss

118
00:07:52,185 --> 00:07:56,627
or are you still mourning
the death of Minister Kalem?

119
00:07:56,661 --> 00:07:59,462
It's for Vedek Bareil...

120
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:01,471
actually.

121
00:08:01,505 --> 00:08:03,031
It's been three months

122
00:08:03,075 --> 00:08:06,014
since Bareil left us
to walk with the Prophets.

123
00:08:06,049 --> 00:08:08,213
You must have cared
for him deeply.

124
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:09,745
I loved him.

125
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,419
As did I.

126
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,521
Is that why you never
mention Bareil's name

127
00:08:13,565 --> 00:08:16,093
when you talk about your peace
treaty with Cardassia?

128
00:08:16,171 --> 00:08:18,335
As I recall, he's the one
who negotiated it.

129
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,345
Bareil saw himself

130
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,751
as simply carrying out
the will of the Prophets.

131
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:25,918
To him, achieving peace
with Cardassia

132
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,657
was its own reward.

133
00:08:28,698 --> 00:08:33,265
He never wanted fame or glory
for what he did.

134
00:08:33,308 --> 00:08:35,575
As someone who loved him

135
00:08:35,613 --> 00:08:38,711
I'm surprised
you didn't know that.

136
00:08:48,475 --> 00:08:50,708
What is it you want, Eminence?

137
00:08:52,484 --> 00:08:55,924
Are you familiar
with Rakantha Province?

138
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,894
It's a farming community.

139
00:08:57,929 --> 00:08:59,455
And it used to be

140
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,498
one of the most productive
agricultural regions on Bajor.

141
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,742
But as you know,
the Cardassians poisoned

142
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:09,446
much of our farmlands
before they left.

143
00:09:09,488 --> 00:09:13,019
And Rakantha has been mostly
barren wasteland ever since.

144
00:09:13,062 --> 00:09:14,622
After years of research

145
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,069
the Agricultural
Ministry has finally

146
00:09:17,105 --> 00:09:18,734
developed reclamators

147
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:22,306
which can detoxify the soil
and make it fertile again.

148
00:09:22,349 --> 00:09:23,978
It's very interesting

149
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,583
but what does it
have to do with me?

150
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,185
Patience, child.

151
00:09:28,296 --> 00:09:32,203
In six months, it will be
planting season in Rakantha.

152
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,208
By this time next year

153
00:09:34,242 --> 00:09:38,206
we can be producing boton,
moreka, and salam grass...

154
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:41,121
all valuable commodities
for export.

155
00:09:41,158 --> 00:09:44,997
If we can attract
interstellar commerce to Bajor

156
00:09:45,032 --> 00:09:47,936
it will only enhance
our application

157
00:09:47,973 --> 00:09:50,638
for membership
in the Federation.

158
00:09:50,678 --> 00:09:52,238
I understand.

159
00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:54,182
Unfortunately

160
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,383
a group of farmers
who were allowed

161
00:09:56,424 --> 00:09:59,089
to use the reclamators
in another province

162
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,363
are now refusing to return them

163
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:03,965
and this is why
I've come to you, Kira.

164
00:10:04,008 --> 00:10:06,878
The farmers
who seized the equipment

165
00:10:06,913 --> 00:10:09,749
are in Dahkur Province...
your home...

166
00:10:09,787 --> 00:10:13,819
and they're led by a man
with whom you're acquainted.

167
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,662
His name is Shakaar.

168
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,668
Shakaar?

169
00:10:16,702 --> 00:10:18,035
And if I'm not mistaken

170
00:10:18,072 --> 00:10:20,305
he was the leader
of your resistance cell

171
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,903
during the occupation.

172
00:10:21,946 --> 00:10:23,039
That's right.

173
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,677
I want you to convince him

174
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,283
to return the equipment
he's stolen.

175
00:10:27,325 --> 00:10:31,528
You want me to go up
against a man

176
00:10:31,568 --> 00:10:35,566
who saved my life
countless times?

177
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,170
For you?

178
00:10:37,214 --> 00:10:39,344
Not for me, child.

179
00:10:39,452 --> 00:10:41,513
For Bajor.

180
00:10:45,031 --> 00:10:48,061
I know we've had
our differences in the past

181
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:51,545
but I'm asking you
to put those feelings aside

182
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:54,552
and think of what is best
for our people.

183
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:56,989
We're on the verge of a new era.

184
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,652
The occupation is over.

185
00:10:58,694 --> 00:11:01,188
We've achieved peace
with Cardassia.

186
00:11:01,234 --> 00:11:04,571
Federation membership
is only a few years away.

187
00:11:04,608 --> 00:11:07,843
This is an exciting
time to be a Bajoran

188
00:11:07,881 --> 00:11:10,717
but our future depends
on each of us

189
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:13,921
acting for the common
good of all Bajor.

190
00:11:13,961 --> 00:11:16,262
Shakaar has lost
sight of this.

191
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,136
By stealing the reclamators,
he's acting

192
00:11:19,173 --> 00:11:21,040
in his own self-interest

193
00:11:21,076 --> 00:11:23,775
at the expense
of the rest of our people.

194
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,377
No, I know Shakaar.

195
00:11:25,487 --> 00:11:28,790
He's one of the most selfless
people I have ever met.

196
00:11:28,828 --> 00:11:31,698
He must have a good reason
for what he's done.

197
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,034
Perhaps.

198
00:11:34,072 --> 00:11:36,737
Perhaps he is just misguided.

199
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:39,045
That's why I've come to you,
Kira.

200
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,712
You know him.

201
00:11:40,753 --> 00:11:42,279
You can talk to him.

202
00:11:42,324 --> 00:11:45,320
I don't want this
to become a scandal.

203
00:11:45,363 --> 00:11:48,666
I want this settled
peacefully, quietly.

204
00:11:48,704 --> 00:11:53,237
Surely, we can both agree
that that's a worthy goal.

205
00:11:56,922 --> 00:11:58,448
I'll talk to him

206
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,657
but I can't guarantee
that he'll listen to me.

207
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,830
Vedek Bareil used to tell me

208
00:12:04,873 --> 00:12:06,775
that you could be
quite persuasive

209
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,611
when you put your mind to it,
child.

210
00:12:09,651 --> 00:12:11,747
I hope he wasn't mistaken.

211
00:12:11,788 --> 00:12:13,918
Walk with the Prophets.

212
00:13:24,114 --> 00:13:25,275
You cut your hair.

213
00:13:26,986 --> 00:13:28,888
You let yours grow.

214
00:13:28,925 --> 00:13:30,827
I liked you the old way.

215
00:13:30,862 --> 00:13:33,163
I was thinking the same thing...

216
00:13:33,201 --> 00:13:35,034
about you.

217
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,950
It's good to see you, Nerys.

218
00:13:40,984 --> 00:13:42,544
It's good to see you, too.

219
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,286
Come on in.

220
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:53,262
So, Major Kira Nerys,
Deep Space 9's First Officer...

221
00:13:53,306 --> 00:13:55,402
you've made quite a name
for yourself.

222
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:57,003
Not really.

223
00:13:57,047 --> 00:13:58,744
You've accomplished
a great deal.

224
00:13:58,784 --> 00:14:00,117
You should be proud.

225
00:14:00,154 --> 00:14:01,953
Furel and Lupaza
are so proud of you,

226
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:03,688
they actually stand
a little taller

227
00:14:03,728 --> 00:14:05,721
every time your name comes up.

228
00:14:05,766 --> 00:14:07,702
Furel and Lupaza?
You still see them?

229
00:14:07,737 --> 00:14:09,138
Of course.

230
00:14:09,174 --> 00:14:11,702
They both have farms less
than ten kilometers from here.

231
00:14:11,746 --> 00:14:13,648
Those two are farmers?!

232
00:14:13,683 --> 00:14:15,050
Now, you, yes.

233
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,718
That's all you
ever talked about.

234
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:18,954
But Lupaza?

235
00:14:18,996 --> 00:14:20,295
How did that happen?

236
00:14:20,331 --> 00:14:21,664
You can ask her yourself.

237
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:23,432
They'll be here
in a couple of hours.

238
00:14:23,472 --> 00:14:25,773
I can hardly wait to see
the look on their faces

239
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:28,749
when they walk through that door
and see you standing there.

240
00:14:33,961 --> 00:14:35,521
Shakaar...

241
00:14:35,565 --> 00:14:39,529
before they get here,
we should talk.

242
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:41,305
I'm here on business.

243
00:14:41,344 --> 00:14:43,838
I know why you're here, Nerys.

244
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,084
I need time to think about it,
all right?

245
00:14:47,123 --> 00:14:49,890
All right.

246
00:15:12,947 --> 00:15:15,943
I think I'll stick
to <i>tongo</i> from now on.

247
00:15:15,987 --> 00:15:17,980
Sorry, Lieutenant.

248
00:15:18,025 --> 00:15:19,517
Thank you.

249
00:15:19,561 --> 00:15:22,089
Thank you all
for your gaming business.

250
00:15:22,134 --> 00:15:24,161
The house will start taking bets

251
00:15:24,205 --> 00:15:27,235
on the next challenger
at 10 to 1.

252
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:28,804
That's 10 to 1
without even knowing...

253
00:15:28,848 --> 00:15:29,816
Quark?

254
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,251
...who the next challenger
will be.

255
00:15:31,287 --> 00:15:33,052
Quark, I have to go.

256
00:15:33,091 --> 00:15:34,390
Uh... no problem.

257
00:15:34,428 --> 00:15:35,988
Ladies and gentlemen

258
00:15:36,031 --> 00:15:39,061
Chief of Operations
Miles Edward O'Brien

259
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:43,513
has to leave to resume
his duties on board the station.

260
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:45,917
Now, everyone, make way.

261
00:15:47,122 --> 00:15:50,254
I trust we'll be seeing
you again tomorrow, Chief

262
00:15:50,296 --> 00:15:52,426
for your 47th straight victory?

263
00:15:52,468 --> 00:15:53,458
I don't know.

264
00:15:53,503 --> 00:15:55,234
I was actually thinking
of getting some time

265
00:15:55,273 --> 00:15:56,298
in the holosuites tomorrow.

266
00:15:56,409 --> 00:15:57,901
The holosuites?

267
00:15:57,946 --> 00:15:58,914
You weren't thinking

268
00:15:58,948 --> 00:16:00,440
of going kayaking,
by any chance?

269
00:16:00,485 --> 00:16:02,352
As a matter of fact, I was.

270
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:03,983
Uh... didn't I tell you?

271
00:16:04,025 --> 00:16:05,494
I misplaced
the kayaking program.

272
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:06,622
Oh...

273
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:07,998
Haven't seen it in days.

274
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:09,503
Quark...

275
00:16:09,538 --> 00:16:11,839
All right.
Look...

276
00:16:11,877 --> 00:16:14,644
you're on a streak,
an epic streak.

277
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,481
If you go kayaking tomorrow

278
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,687
and something happens
and you damage

279
00:16:19,727 --> 00:16:23,394
that golden shoulder,
this streak will be over.

280
00:16:23,436 --> 00:16:25,133
And you'll never know

281
00:16:25,173 --> 00:16:27,838
just how far
it might have taken you.

282
00:16:27,878 --> 00:16:30,076
Could you really
live with that?

283
00:16:30,117 --> 00:16:33,215
Uh... you're offering 10 to 1

284
00:16:33,256 --> 00:16:35,784
to anyone betting
against me tomorrow?

285
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,424
That's right.

286
00:16:37,467 --> 00:16:40,234
I'd make it 15, if I were you.

287
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,306
Yes.

288
00:16:53,301 --> 00:16:55,864
You never would've found
your way out of there

289
00:16:55,907 --> 00:16:59,039
if I hadn't left
that marker on that rock.

290
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,709
I have a fine
sense of direction.

291
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,085
I knew exactly where I was
that night, exactly.

292
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,819
I found your tracks
the next day.

293
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,488
You'd been walking in circles.

294
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,697
I was throwing
the Cardassians off my trail.

295
00:17:12,476 --> 00:17:14,572
Again, please.

296
00:17:17,186 --> 00:17:20,991
Furel... if you
don't mind my asking...

297
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:24,002
why haven't you?

298
00:17:24,035 --> 00:17:26,005
Had my arm replaced?

299
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,669
Well, I thought about it.

300
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,375
I even saw a Federation
doctor about it.

301
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,578
She said, "No problem, Furel.

302
00:17:32,621 --> 00:17:35,388
"You can have a new arm
in less than a week.

303
00:17:35,493 --> 00:17:38,329
"It'll have full range of motion

304
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:41,340
and... it'll feel
just like your own."

305
00:17:41,373 --> 00:17:43,309
So, why didn't you do it?

306
00:17:46,084 --> 00:17:48,351
Well... before I went

307
00:17:48,389 --> 00:17:51,920
into that
interrogation center...

308
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,436
I asked the Prophets
to give me the strength

309
00:17:56,473 --> 00:17:59,138
to get the rest of you
out of there.

310
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,649
And, well, in exchange, I...

311
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:05,787
I said I'd give up my life.

312
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,638
Well, as it turned out

313
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:15,740
I was able to rescue you,
Shakaar

314
00:18:15,782 --> 00:18:21,921
and Lupaza,
and it only cost me an arm.

315
00:18:21,962 --> 00:18:25,960
I felt the...
the Prophets were generous.

316
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:30,641
Somehow,
replacing the arm seems...

317
00:18:30,681 --> 00:18:32,811
ungrateful.

318
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:36,624
I think you're just afraid
that with two arms

319
00:18:36,661 --> 00:18:39,189
you'd actually have to do
some real work, for a change.

320
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:41,966
I have done more work
in three months on my farm

321
00:18:42,006 --> 00:18:43,908
than you have done
in three years!

322
00:18:43,944 --> 00:18:46,745
I have seen better weeds
than the crops you grow.

323
00:18:46,784 --> 00:18:49,312
You know good and well
that my soil's more toxic

324
00:18:49,356 --> 00:18:51,827
than any other farm tract
within 100 kilometers.

325
00:18:51,862 --> 00:18:53,661
- Ha!
- It's true!

326
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,193
Once I get a chance to use
one of the reclamators

327
00:18:56,238 --> 00:18:58,402
things will change,
I can promise you that.

328
00:18:58,442 --> 00:19:01,438
You may not get
that chance, Lupaza.

329
00:19:01,482 --> 00:19:05,423
Nerys was sent here by the Kai,
with orders to convince us

330
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,431
to return the reclamators
to the government.

331
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:10,698
And you said no.

332
00:19:10,736 --> 00:19:12,729
I said I'd have
to think about it.

333
00:19:12,774 --> 00:19:16,772
There's not much to think about,
Shakaar, you know that.

334
00:19:16,817 --> 00:19:19,050
Tell the Kai,
or the First Minister

335
00:19:19,087 --> 00:19:21,957
or whatever she wants
to be called these days

336
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,588
that the answer is no.

337
00:19:23,631 --> 00:19:26,866
We need the reclamators,
and that's the end of it.

338
00:19:26,905 --> 00:19:30,367
Now, who wants tuwaly pie?

339
00:19:44,243 --> 00:19:47,239
You know, this business
with the reclamators

340
00:19:47,283 --> 00:19:49,948
isn't going to just
go away, Shakaar.

341
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,481
Maybe not.

342
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:53,552
Definitely not.

343
00:19:53,664 --> 00:19:56,135
I think you should reconsider.

344
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:59,574
I know what you're
trying to do here

345
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:02,377
and I know
how difficult it's been.

346
00:20:03,853 --> 00:20:07,885
We have to think about
what's best for Bajor.

347
00:20:09,632 --> 00:20:11,568
If you think giving
the reclamators back

348
00:20:11,603 --> 00:20:13,539
to the government
is the best thing for Bajor

349
00:20:13,574 --> 00:20:14,838
then you've been out

350
00:20:14,877 --> 00:20:16,312
on that space station
for too long.

351
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:20,949
We waited three years
to get the reclamators.

352
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,359
We finally got them
two months ago

353
00:20:23,395 --> 00:20:27,130
and we were told they were ours
for at least a year.

354
00:20:28,975 --> 00:20:30,376
The provisional government

355
00:20:30,411 --> 00:20:32,404
actually did something right,
for a change.

356
00:20:36,023 --> 00:20:38,927
Then Minister Kalem died.

357
00:20:38,963 --> 00:20:43,268
And the next thing we know,
we get an order

358
00:20:43,306 --> 00:20:47,338
to return
the reclamators immediately

359
00:20:47,382 --> 00:20:50,252
to the Rakantha Farming Project.

360
00:20:50,288 --> 00:20:52,019
The Rakantha Project
is important.

361
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:53,528
If they can get it underway

362
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:55,622
Bajor could start exporting
goods again.

363
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,295
It could start to change the way

364
00:20:57,337 --> 00:20:59,102
the rest of the galaxy
looks at us.

365
00:20:59,141 --> 00:21:01,202
They'll stop seeing us
as poor refugees

366
00:21:01,246 --> 00:21:02,840
and start seeing us as equals.

367
00:21:02,883 --> 00:21:04,512
I don't give a damn

368
00:21:04,553 --> 00:21:06,820
how the rest of
the galaxy looks at us.

369
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:10,657
We're trying to feed
our own people here

370
00:21:10,766 --> 00:21:12,964
and you're talking
about exports.

371
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:17,604
There must be a way to reach
some kind of compromise here.

372
00:21:17,648 --> 00:21:18,947
How?

373
00:21:18,984 --> 00:21:20,647
I don't know,
but if you and the Kai

374
00:21:20,688 --> 00:21:22,681
would sit down and talk together

375
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:25,526
maybe you can reach
some kind of agreement...

376
00:21:25,566 --> 00:21:28,231
some way of sharing
the equipment more fairly.

377
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:31,141
If I could arrange a meeting
between the two of you

378
00:21:31,178 --> 00:21:32,909
would you at least agree
to sit down

379
00:21:32,949 --> 00:21:34,316
and talk with her about it?

380
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:38,624
I don't know
if it'll accomplish anything.

381
00:21:38,661 --> 00:21:41,292
It might not,
but it's a place to start.

382
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:44,699
All right...

383
00:21:44,741 --> 00:21:46,210
for you.

384
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,769
It's good to have you home,
Nerys.

385
00:21:59,874 --> 00:22:02,573
You should come back more often.

386
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,242
I might do that.

387
00:22:04,284 --> 00:22:06,277
Well, good.

388
00:22:06,322 --> 00:22:08,759
Because we've all missed you.

389
00:22:10,665 --> 00:22:12,898
Especially me.

390
00:22:27,272 --> 00:22:30,768
Am I to assume, my child,
that you've met with Shakaar?

391
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:35,750
We talked.

392
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:39,596
And have you convinced him
to return the soil reclamators?

393
00:22:39,633 --> 00:22:41,432
He's not ready
to return them yet.

394
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,962
I see.

395
00:22:43,007 --> 00:22:45,240
When can we expect their return?

396
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:47,009
When the topsoil
in Dahkur Province

397
00:22:47,048 --> 00:22:49,246
has been restored and
readied for planting...

398
00:22:49,287 --> 00:22:50,620
another six months.

399
00:22:50,723 --> 00:22:53,388
In six months,
the planting season

400
00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:55,490
in Rakantha will be over.

401
00:22:58,373 --> 00:23:00,936
I realize that.

402
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:05,888
And I know how important
the Rakantha Project is

403
00:23:05,923 --> 00:23:08,554
which is why
I've arranged a meeting

404
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,190
between the two of you.

405
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:11,532
A meeting?

406
00:23:11,569 --> 00:23:13,733
Yes, to work out a compromise.

407
00:23:13,774 --> 00:23:15,175
If you just hear him out

408
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,408
and look at the work
they've been able

409
00:23:17,449 --> 00:23:19,886
to accomplish in Dahkur
in just two months

410
00:23:19,921 --> 00:23:22,552
you'll see how important
this is to them.

411
00:23:22,593 --> 00:23:25,623
I'm sure there's a way
to resolve this situation

412
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,604
so that both Rakantha
and Dahkur can benefit.

413
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,873
Did you explain to Shakaar
that you were there

414
00:23:30,912 --> 00:23:33,885
on the direct authority
of the First Minister?

415
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,915
Yes, but it wouldn't have
mattered if I was there

416
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:39,293
on behalf of the
Prophets, themselves.

417
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:42,200
He wasn't about to just
give up the equipment.

418
00:23:43,573 --> 00:23:46,067
A pity.

419
00:23:46,111 --> 00:23:49,984
Shakaar sounds like
a prideful and arrogant man.

420
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:53,425
It also seems there's
no reasoning with him.

421
00:23:53,461 --> 00:23:55,694
Shakaar is not
an unreasonable man.

422
00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:57,702
He is desperate.
They all are.

423
00:23:57,737 --> 00:24:00,368
You should see
what they're up against...

424
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:03,382
the condition of the soil,
the harsh weather.

425
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:05,352
I'm sure if you talk to him

426
00:24:05,387 --> 00:24:07,858
you'll be able to work out
a compromise.

427
00:24:07,892 --> 00:24:11,229
It would seem
that I have little choice.

428
00:24:13,438 --> 00:24:16,035
So, I can tell him
that you'll discuss it with him?

429
00:24:16,077 --> 00:24:17,876
You can tell him that

430
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:21,149
and then you can return
to Deep Space 9.

431
00:24:21,188 --> 00:24:23,682
But I can still serve
as intermediary

432
00:24:23,727 --> 00:24:25,094
between you and Shakaar.

433
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,464
That won't be necessary.

434
00:24:26,501 --> 00:24:28,471
You've done enough already.

435
00:24:28,505 --> 00:24:32,674
And please, give my best regards
to Commander Sisko.

436
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,458
That will be all, my child.

437
00:24:55,397 --> 00:24:57,367
I'll be interested to hear
what she has to say

438
00:24:57,402 --> 00:24:59,395
but, uh, she's not getting
those reclamators back

439
00:24:59,439 --> 00:25:00,738
till we're finished with them.

440
00:25:00,776 --> 00:25:02,712
Shakaar, you have
to be flexible.

441
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,716
I'm not sure this is
a fight you can win.

442
00:25:04,818 --> 00:25:06,914
That's what the Cardassians
used to say.

443
00:25:08,259 --> 00:25:09,420
Come in.

444
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,899
Are you Shakaar?

445
00:25:12,935 --> 00:25:14,062
Yes.

446
00:25:14,105 --> 00:25:15,574
You're under arrest.

447
00:25:15,609 --> 00:25:17,078
Wait a minute.
On whose authority?

448
00:25:17,111 --> 00:25:18,637
Our orders came directly

449
00:25:18,681 --> 00:25:21,084
from the Office
of the First Minister.

450
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,419
She lied to me.

451
00:25:22,457 --> 00:25:24,086
She's good at it, Nerys.

452
00:25:24,127 --> 00:25:25,254
Don't feel bad.

453
00:25:25,296 --> 00:25:26,765
If you'll come with us.

454
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:28,062
Yeah, all right.

455
00:25:28,103 --> 00:25:30,973
I just want to make
one thing clear.

456
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:37,552
Glad to see that living
on a space station

457
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,615
hasn't slowed you down.

458
00:25:38,659 --> 00:25:39,786
We have to get out of here.

459
00:25:39,862 --> 00:25:42,333
This can still be
explained away.

460
00:25:42,367 --> 00:25:44,234
It was a tense situation.

461
00:25:44,271 --> 00:25:46,036
You acted on instinct.

462
00:25:46,075 --> 00:25:48,011
They'll understand that

463
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,745
but they won't understand
you coming with me.

464
00:25:50,786 --> 00:25:52,916
This isn't your fight, Nerys.

465
00:25:52,957 --> 00:25:54,722
Go home.

466
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,161
I am home, Shakaar.

467
00:25:56,197 --> 00:25:59,728
And I have been lied to
by Kai Winn for the last time.

468
00:25:59,771 --> 00:26:02,242
She wants a fight,
I'll give her one.

469
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:10,158
The civil police have issued

470
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:12,325
a province-wide alert
for you and Kira.

471
00:26:12,367 --> 00:26:15,134
They've also requested
that the surrounding towns

472
00:26:15,172 --> 00:26:17,074
send more troops and equipment

473
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,206
to help in the search
for the fugitives.

474
00:26:19,248 --> 00:26:20,911
Now there's a familiar word.

475
00:26:20,952 --> 00:26:23,321
Haven't been called
that in a while.

476
00:26:23,357 --> 00:26:25,487
I kind of missed it.

477
00:26:27,566 --> 00:26:29,297
The authorities
have seized your farm

478
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,467
and they've brought in
a scanning machine

479
00:26:31,509 --> 00:26:33,411
to hunt for the reclamators.

480
00:26:33,446 --> 00:26:34,414
Let them scan.

481
00:26:34,448 --> 00:26:35,849
There's nothing there to find.

482
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,012
They've also detained

483
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,457
some of the other members
of our resistance cell

484
00:26:39,492 --> 00:26:40,517
for "questioning."

485
00:26:40,561 --> 00:26:41,688
Who?

486
00:26:41,731 --> 00:26:43,633
Mobara, Klin and Ornak

487
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:45,764
were taken away
before I could reach them.

488
00:26:45,807 --> 00:26:48,677
The others are heading for
the Kola Mountain stronghold.

489
00:26:48,713 --> 00:26:51,207
I said we'd meet them there
and go over our plan.

490
00:26:51,251 --> 00:26:53,381
Well, what is our plan?

491
00:26:53,423 --> 00:26:55,416
For now, the plan
is to keep moving.

492
00:26:55,461 --> 00:26:58,058
We'll let the civil police
run themselves ragged

493
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,899
chasing us through
the mountains.

494
00:27:00,005 --> 00:27:02,340
Just like old times.

495
00:27:02,377 --> 00:27:04,006
That's the general idea.

496
00:27:04,047 --> 00:27:05,641
The Cardassians spent ten years

497
00:27:05,683 --> 00:27:07,585
searching for us
in these mountains.

498
00:27:07,621 --> 00:27:10,958
The civil police will probably
give up in ten days.

499
00:27:10,995 --> 00:27:12,624
I'm not so sure about that.

500
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:15,296
Some of them were
in the resistance, too.

501
00:27:15,338 --> 00:27:17,468
They might not give up
so easily.

502
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,606
Maybe, but I really don't think
they want to hunt down

503
00:27:19,647 --> 00:27:21,446
a group of fellow Bajorans
who are just trying

504
00:27:21,484 --> 00:27:22,679
to defend their homes.

505
00:27:22,721 --> 00:27:24,156
Hmm.

506
00:27:24,191 --> 00:27:27,824
We head for Kola Mountain,
pick up anybody who's there

507
00:27:27,865 --> 00:27:30,029
then move further
into the hill country.

508
00:27:30,071 --> 00:27:31,438
Well, let's go.

509
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,427
Yes!

510
00:27:44,469 --> 00:27:45,596
A most auspicious shot.

511
00:27:45,637 --> 00:27:46,764
You got him, Chief.

512
00:27:46,807 --> 00:27:48,106
One in the bull and you win.

513
00:27:48,143 --> 00:27:50,204
I think he knows that, Julian.

514
00:27:50,248 --> 00:27:52,947
Don't worry, Coach,
I won't let you down.

515
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,150
I see no reason for delay.

516
00:27:55,192 --> 00:27:56,559
Throw the dart.

517
00:27:56,596 --> 00:27:58,190
I will throw the dart

518
00:27:58,232 --> 00:27:59,963
when I'm ready
to throw the dart.

519
00:28:00,036 --> 00:28:00,969
Did I miss anything?

520
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:02,006
Shh!

521
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,201
Is that my synthale?

522
00:28:03,243 --> 00:28:05,544
Extra stout...
just the way you like it.

523
00:28:05,581 --> 00:28:07,073
Excuse me.

524
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:08,108
Here you go.

525
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,751
What is it?

526
00:28:10,793 --> 00:28:11,761
It's his shoulder.

527
00:28:11,795 --> 00:28:12,763
Popped out of its socket.

528
00:28:12,797 --> 00:28:14,096
Get me the tricorder.

529
00:28:14,134 --> 00:28:15,433
What did I do?

530
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,463
I just handed him a drink.

531
00:28:17,508 --> 00:28:19,444
It's all right, just-just
pop it back in, Julian.

532
00:28:19,479 --> 00:28:20,948
I'll-I'll be all right.

533
00:28:20,982 --> 00:28:21,950
Oh, no, I'm afraid

534
00:28:21,984 --> 00:28:23,749
it's not that simple
this time, Chief.

535
00:28:23,788 --> 00:28:27,695
You've got a rotator cuff tear
and severe degenerative damage.

536
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,199
We'd better get him
to the Infirmary.

537
00:28:29,234 --> 00:28:31,967
If he leaves the line,
he forfeits the game.

538
00:28:32,006 --> 00:28:33,532
Forfeit?

539
00:28:33,577 --> 00:28:34,545
This man needs surgery.

540
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:35,878
Surgery!

541
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:36,974
That's right, Chief.

542
00:28:37,017 --> 00:28:39,420
I may have to replace
the entire humeral socket.

543
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:40,982
It's not
a complicated procedure.

544
00:28:41,026 --> 00:28:42,359
We can postpone the rest

545
00:28:42,395 --> 00:28:44,228
of this competition
until tomorrow

546
00:28:44,267 --> 00:28:46,363
at which time,
he will be good as new.

547
00:28:46,404 --> 00:28:48,169
I don't make the rules.

548
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:49,609
I merely follow them.

549
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,706
Wait, wait, wait... look...

550
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,586
I'm in the zone!

551
00:28:57,061 --> 00:28:59,031
I just need...

552
00:29:00,602 --> 00:29:03,039
Oh, I just need surgery.

553
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:12,222
I believe the house
is paying 15 to 1.

554
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,308
All I did was hand him a drink.

555
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,364
Emissary, I'm so happy
you came to consult with me.

556
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:33,305
Frankly, I'm surprised
you wanted my advice.

557
00:29:33,341 --> 00:29:37,248
The advice of the Emissary
is always welcome

558
00:29:37,283 --> 00:29:39,447
but what I need is your help.

559
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:41,321
What kind of help?

560
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:42,988
It's been two weeks

561
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:45,557
since I was forced
to send the militia

562
00:29:45,601 --> 00:29:47,070
into Dahkur Province.

563
00:29:47,171 --> 00:29:48,834
And?

564
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:52,178
And they've yet to catch sight
of Shakaar

565
00:29:52,216 --> 00:29:54,083
or any of his followers

566
00:29:54,153 --> 00:29:56,522
let alone take them
into custody.

567
00:29:56,558 --> 00:29:58,084
I guess now you know

568
00:29:58,162 --> 00:30:00,531
how the Cardassians
must have felt.

569
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:04,741
The point is, I can't let this
go on much longer.

570
00:30:04,874 --> 00:30:08,075
It embarrasses me to say this

571
00:30:08,115 --> 00:30:11,145
but Shakaar's defiance
seems to be catching on

572
00:30:11,188 --> 00:30:13,386
in some of the other provinces.

573
00:30:13,427 --> 00:30:15,921
And I've had to take certain...

574
00:30:15,966 --> 00:30:18,836
unfortunate actions
to maintain order.

575
00:30:18,872 --> 00:30:20,535
You mean declaring martial law

576
00:30:20,576 --> 00:30:24,016
and suspending local government
in the hill provinces?

577
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:26,920
I wasn't aware
that you kept such close watch

578
00:30:26,957 --> 00:30:29,190
on the Bajoran
political situation.

579
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,890
From what I understand

580
00:30:30,931 --> 00:30:34,098
Shakaar is gaining support
all over Bajor.

581
00:30:34,138 --> 00:30:37,305
Is that what Major Kira's
been telling you?

582
00:30:37,346 --> 00:30:40,808
I haven't spoken with Major Kira
in quite some time.

583
00:30:40,853 --> 00:30:47,026
Emissary, I don't want
this issue to divide my people.

584
00:30:47,067 --> 00:30:50,666
Then I advise withdrawing
your troops from Dahkur.

585
00:30:50,708 --> 00:30:52,610
I'm more than willing
to do that.

586
00:30:52,647 --> 00:30:54,116
On one condition.

587
00:30:54,149 --> 00:30:56,313
And what might that be?

588
00:30:56,354 --> 00:31:00,125
I'd like you to provide
a Federation security force

589
00:31:00,163 --> 00:31:01,996
to take their place.

590
00:31:04,673 --> 00:31:07,474
You want me
to bring in Shakaar for you.

591
00:31:07,512 --> 00:31:10,974
Such an act would do much
to solidify the relations

592
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,253
between the Federation
and Bajor.

593
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:16,731
I wasn't aware that our
relationship needed solidifying.

594
00:31:16,832 --> 00:31:18,734
Nevertheless,
this would be an opportunity

595
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:21,298
for the Federation
to show, once again

596
00:31:21,342 --> 00:31:23,107
its friendship for Bajor.

597
00:31:26,387 --> 00:31:29,154
I'm sorry,
but Federation law prevents me

598
00:31:29,193 --> 00:31:32,325
from interfering
in Bajoran internal affairs.

599
00:31:33,737 --> 00:31:35,229
So...

600
00:31:37,411 --> 00:31:40,110
you're refusing my request
for aid?

601
00:31:42,923 --> 00:31:44,722
I suppose I am.

602
00:31:46,097 --> 00:31:49,298
If Bajor cannot depend
on the Federation

603
00:31:49,337 --> 00:31:53,004
we'll withdraw our application
for membership.

604
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:56,816
That would be an unfortunate
overreaction on your part.

605
00:31:56,888 --> 00:31:59,257
If I may say so,
your entire response

606
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,923
to this crisis
has been an overreaction.

607
00:32:01,965 --> 00:32:04,664
By using the militia
against your own people

608
00:32:04,704 --> 00:32:06,196
you're risking civil war

609
00:32:06,241 --> 00:32:08,542
over a couple of...
soil reclamators.

610
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:12,715
I'm afraid you can't see
what's really going on here.

611
00:32:12,756 --> 00:32:16,218
This isn't
about soil reclamators.

612
00:32:16,263 --> 00:32:19,725
This is about the future
of our society.

613
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:23,074
When someone like Shakaar
can defy the law

614
00:32:23,111 --> 00:32:24,808
and escape punishment

615
00:32:24,849 --> 00:32:28,550
we risk descending
into anarchy and chaos.

616
00:32:28,591 --> 00:32:30,960
This is a test...

617
00:32:30,995 --> 00:32:33,125
a test by the Prophets.

618
00:32:35,137 --> 00:32:38,736
They want to see if I'm worthy
of the role they've given me

619
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:40,578
as First Minister and Kai.

620
00:32:40,617 --> 00:32:43,020
I will not fail them.

621
00:32:43,055 --> 00:32:46,551
I will stop Shakaar
by any means necessary.

622
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:00,920
Move, move, move!

623
00:33:24,847 --> 00:33:26,214
They're closing.

624
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,218
75 meters.

625
00:33:27,252 --> 00:33:28,379
Come on, Kira.

626
00:33:28,421 --> 00:33:29,890
I've almost got it.

627
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:31,518
They're on the ridge.

628
00:33:44,557 --> 00:33:46,584
Kira, if you can't do it,
tell me now.

629
00:33:46,628 --> 00:33:48,063
I got it.

630
00:33:54,011 --> 00:33:56,448
New reading.
700 meters, that way.

631
00:33:56,483 --> 00:33:57,576
Yes, sir.

632
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:58,678
Let's go.

633
00:34:02,296 --> 00:34:03,491
How long do we have?

634
00:34:03,532 --> 00:34:05,399
I've projected
the false life signs

635
00:34:05,437 --> 00:34:07,601
about 700 meters
past that ravine.

636
00:34:07,641 --> 00:34:11,240
It'll take them about an hour
to cover that distance

637
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:13,720
another 15 to realize
what's happened.

638
00:34:15,157 --> 00:34:17,127
Either I am getting older

639
00:34:17,162 --> 00:34:19,861
or these mountains
are getting higher.

640
00:34:19,901 --> 00:34:22,532
The next time I start
getting nostalgic

641
00:34:22,574 --> 00:34:25,706
for the old days, shoot me.

642
00:34:25,747 --> 00:34:27,808
If you insist.

643
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:34,055
They're good.

644
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:35,625
Half of them are
from Dahkur Province.

645
00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:38,642
They know this terrain
almost as well as we do.

646
00:34:38,675 --> 00:34:40,269
I think you're right.

647
00:34:40,312 --> 00:34:42,214
We need to leave Dahkur.

648
00:34:42,251 --> 00:34:43,982
They'll box us in
if we stay much longer.

649
00:34:44,088 --> 00:34:46,286
We could take Serpent's Ridge
to Retosha Pass

650
00:34:46,326 --> 00:34:47,761
and head for Lonar Province.

651
00:34:50,636 --> 00:34:53,437
Serpent's Ridge
is pretty rugged territory.

652
00:34:53,475 --> 00:34:55,206
I don't think
we have much choice.

653
00:34:55,245 --> 00:34:56,908
Yes, we do.

654
00:35:02,662 --> 00:35:04,655
We can turn and fight.

655
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,329
He's right, Shakaar.

656
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,737
It's just like in the old days.

657
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:10,301
Every once in a while, the
Cardassians would get too close

658
00:35:10,345 --> 00:35:12,543
and we'd turn around
and give them a bloody nose.

659
00:35:14,554 --> 00:35:17,618
Sometimes it was our nose
that got bloodied.

660
00:35:17,661 --> 00:35:20,634
We were willing
to take the chance.

661
00:35:22,138 --> 00:35:25,270
Now, I'll follow whatever orders
you give...

662
00:35:25,311 --> 00:35:27,407
but I am tired of running.

663
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,291
Kira?

664
00:35:31,325 --> 00:35:33,990
I'm not sure we can
keep up this pace.

665
00:35:36,336 --> 00:35:38,466
All right.

666
00:35:38,507 --> 00:35:40,705
We head for Tanis Canyon.

667
00:35:40,746 --> 00:35:42,238
Kira's on point.

668
00:35:42,283 --> 00:35:43,444
Column of twos behind her.

669
00:35:43,485 --> 00:35:44,578
Lupaza, you take up the rear.

670
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,955
There is no way out
of Tanis Canyon.

671
00:35:46,992 --> 00:35:48,791
And that's why
we're going to lead

672
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,424
those militia troops in there.

673
00:35:50,466 --> 00:35:52,767
'Cause we're going
to be waiting for them.

674
00:35:52,805 --> 00:35:54,297
Let's move!

675
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:14,446
I don't think
they've picked us up

676
00:36:14,481 --> 00:36:15,745
on their tricorders.

677
00:36:15,785 --> 00:36:17,881
They won't either, not with
that dampening field in place.

678
00:36:37,365 --> 00:36:39,461
I think I recognize that man.

679
00:36:39,503 --> 00:36:40,471
Which one?

680
00:36:40,505 --> 00:36:41,700
The Colonel.

681
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:44,179
That's Lenaris Holem.

682
00:36:44,214 --> 00:36:45,615
Lenaris...

683
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:48,247
from the Ornathia
resistance cell.

684
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:52,128
I met him at a reception
in the capital about a year ago.

685
00:36:52,164 --> 00:36:54,658
He's good.

686
00:36:54,703 --> 00:36:56,833
No wonder we haven't lost them.

687
00:36:56,875 --> 00:37:00,007
We'll have to get him
with the first volley.

688
00:37:00,048 --> 00:37:02,485
You take the Lieutenant
on the right.

689
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:03,955
I'll take Lenaris.

690
00:37:32,118 --> 00:37:33,747
I can't.

691
00:37:33,789 --> 00:37:35,190
I'm sorry.

692
00:37:35,226 --> 00:37:36,957
Don't be.

693
00:37:39,635 --> 00:37:41,502
I can't either.

694
00:37:49,357 --> 00:37:50,883
Hold.

695
00:37:59,245 --> 00:38:01,272
Set a perimeter,
and watch the hills.

696
00:38:01,316 --> 00:38:02,284
Yes, sir.

697
00:38:02,318 --> 00:38:03,377
B Team, left flank.

698
00:38:09,334 --> 00:38:11,737
Nobody fires
until I give the order.

699
00:38:11,773 --> 00:38:12,900
Aye, sir.

700
00:38:12,942 --> 00:38:14,502
Firing positions, hold!

701
00:38:24,834 --> 00:38:27,101
That's far enough.

702
00:38:28,543 --> 00:38:30,274
Shakaar?

703
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:34,616
Kira Nerys.

704
00:38:34,656 --> 00:38:36,592
We've met.

705
00:38:36,627 --> 00:38:39,497
I've wanted to thank you
for a long time.

706
00:38:39,533 --> 00:38:43,200
I had a brother at Gallitep
when you liberated the camp.

707
00:38:43,242 --> 00:38:45,338
A lot of people did.

708
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,874
I just wish
we'd gotten there sooner.

709
00:38:49,155 --> 00:38:53,460
Well, I take it
from your calm demeanor

710
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,799
that I've walked into an ambush.

711
00:38:55,836 --> 00:38:58,467
I should have stayed up
on the ridgeline

712
00:38:58,509 --> 00:39:00,673
never come down into the valley.

713
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,809
It's an easy mistake to make.

714
00:39:02,851 --> 00:39:05,448
You thought we were
another two kilometers ahead

715
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:07,483
so you tried to make up time.

716
00:39:07,529 --> 00:39:09,556
I might have done
the same thing.

717
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,061
I think I should tell you
I've been in worse situations.

718
00:39:13,107 --> 00:39:14,974
The Pullock V raid.

719
00:39:15,012 --> 00:39:17,108
You know about that?

720
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:20,316
The first off-world raid
against the Cardassians.

721
00:39:20,356 --> 00:39:21,517
Of course.

722
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,495
It was a bold move.

723
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,660
If you know about Pullock V

724
00:39:25,769 --> 00:39:29,676
then you should also know I
won't give up without a fight.

725
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:31,645
If you're here
to ask me to surrender

726
00:39:31,682 --> 00:39:33,481
you're wasting your time.

727
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:36,686
That's not why I'm here.

728
00:39:36,759 --> 00:39:39,891
I want to take my people
and walk out of here.

729
00:39:39,932 --> 00:39:42,130
I want to take them home.

730
00:39:45,946 --> 00:39:46,675
Wait!

731
00:39:46,715 --> 00:39:47,705
Stop, stop!

732
00:39:47,783 --> 00:39:48,808
No one shoot!
No one shoot!

733
00:39:48,852 --> 00:39:50,617
Cease fire!
Cease fire!

734
00:39:51,893 --> 00:39:53,020
Hold your fire!

735
00:40:06,324 --> 00:40:07,623
Sir, I saw someone.

736
00:40:07,661 --> 00:40:10,292
I thought they were
going to open fire.

737
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:12,166
Lieutenant.

738
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,575
Take this man's weapon
and get him off the perimeter.

739
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:23,026
Now, I believe
you were saying something

740
00:40:23,061 --> 00:40:24,724
about wanting
to walk out of here?

741
00:40:24,764 --> 00:40:25,732
That's right.

742
00:40:25,766 --> 00:40:27,030
You know that's impossible.

743
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:29,131
Well, we better find a way
to make it possible

744
00:40:29,175 --> 00:40:31,271
because the next time
someone starts shooting

745
00:40:31,312 --> 00:40:32,576
we won't be able to stop it.

746
00:40:32,616 --> 00:40:34,108
And I'm not talking about today.

747
00:40:34,151 --> 00:40:37,613
I'm talking about tomorrow
and the next day and the next.

748
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,633
I am talking about
the beginning of a civil war.

749
00:40:40,666 --> 00:40:42,533
I didn't fight the Cardassians

750
00:40:42,571 --> 00:40:46,067
for 25 years just so I could
start shooting other Bajorans.

751
00:40:49,018 --> 00:40:51,489
Neither did I.

752
00:40:51,523 --> 00:40:54,928
So... what do we do about it?

753
00:41:04,218 --> 00:41:05,687
What is it?

754
00:41:05,721 --> 00:41:08,522
Colonel Lenaris
is here to see you.

755
00:41:08,561 --> 00:41:10,224
Send him in.

756
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:21,551
I see you've brought me
a pair of gifts.

757
00:41:21,589 --> 00:41:23,422
How thoughtful of you.

758
00:41:25,264 --> 00:41:27,234
They're not my prisoners.

759
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:31,040
What do you mean,
they're not your prisoners?

760
00:41:31,077 --> 00:41:32,546
What's going on?

761
00:41:32,581 --> 00:41:34,711
I'm here to enter the election

762
00:41:34,752 --> 00:41:38,317
as a candidate for the Office
of First Minister.

763
00:41:40,063 --> 00:41:42,899
You have an interesting
sense of humor.

764
00:41:42,936 --> 00:41:44,269
It's no joke.

765
00:41:44,306 --> 00:41:46,539
Shakaar is going
to enter the election

766
00:41:46,577 --> 00:41:48,103
and you are going to lose.

767
00:41:48,148 --> 00:41:50,676
I've consulted
with the other army commands

768
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,747
and he has their full support.

769
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,231
So, this is a coup?

770
00:41:56,266 --> 00:41:58,202
No.
It's a free election.

771
00:41:58,236 --> 00:42:00,229
If you want to run, go ahead.

772
00:42:00,275 --> 00:42:03,111
But if you do,
this entire incident

773
00:42:03,147 --> 00:42:04,376
is going to be made public.

774
00:42:04,417 --> 00:42:06,250
And when the people
know the real facts...

775
00:42:06,288 --> 00:42:09,420
when they know that you
risked a civil war

776
00:42:09,462 --> 00:42:12,526
over a couple of pieces
of farm equipment...

777
00:42:12,568 --> 00:42:15,507
they're never going
to trust you again.

778
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:22,455
You'll still be Kai...
the spiritual leader of Bajor...

779
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:25,486
but your days in this office
are numbered.

780
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:30,140
So, if I were you...

781
00:42:30,174 --> 00:42:32,235
I'd start packing.

782
00:42:47,545 --> 00:42:50,108
How does it feel?

783
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,120
Good, so far.

784
00:42:52,155 --> 00:42:53,647
Let's see...

785
00:42:57,166 --> 00:42:59,637
Well, try it again, Chief.

786
00:42:59,672 --> 00:43:02,143
Nah...

787
00:43:02,177 --> 00:43:04,478
I can feel it.

788
00:43:04,516 --> 00:43:06,145
I'm out of the zone.

789
00:43:06,186 --> 00:43:07,746
You know...

790
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:09,384
I've played sports all my life

791
00:43:09,427 --> 00:43:12,423
and I've never been in the zone
like that before.

792
00:43:12,466 --> 00:43:14,562
Probably never will again.

793
00:43:14,605 --> 00:43:17,236
But it felt good
while it lasted.

794
00:43:17,277 --> 00:43:18,906
Well, look on the bright side.

795
00:43:18,947 --> 00:43:20,439
Now you have a new shoulder

796
00:43:20,484 --> 00:43:23,115
you might finally finish
that kayaking program.

797
00:43:23,156 --> 00:43:24,523
Hey... you may be right.

798
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,189
Quark...

799
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:28,223
I need a holosuite.

800
00:43:33,412 --> 00:43:35,713
Doctor...

801
00:43:35,751 --> 00:43:38,952
welcome to "the zone."

802
00:43:40,628 --> 00:43:41,857
Let me tell you

803
00:43:41,898 --> 00:43:44,563
about a little thing
I can do...

804
00:43:46,174 --> 00:43:48,235
Have any other candidates
entered the election?

805
00:43:48,278 --> 00:43:50,043
Oh, one or two,
but Shakaar's popularity

806
00:43:50,115 --> 00:43:51,174
is growing so fast

807
00:43:51,218 --> 00:43:53,382
I don't think anyone
can catch him at this point.

808
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:54,722
What about the Kai?

809
00:43:54,759 --> 00:43:56,855
She's trying to make
the best of it.

810
00:43:56,897 --> 00:44:00,702
She even put out a statement
of support for Shakaar.

811
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:02,368
Oh! You know...

812
00:44:02,409 --> 00:44:05,405
I used to enjoy
sleeping on the ground.

813
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:07,443
It's good
to have you back, Major.

814
00:44:07,487 --> 00:44:09,218
It's good to be back, sir.

815
00:44:09,257 --> 00:44:10,556
I'll see you in Ops.
