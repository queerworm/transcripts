1
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:05,547
Got you this time, Chief.

2
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,392
(<i> sighs</i> )

3
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,603
Sorry, Commander.

4
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:20,646
Don't apologize.

5
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:22,731
That just
makes it worse.

6
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,066
I guess I'm just
in the zone today.

7
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:26,485
"In the zone"?

8
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:28,654
The feeling
that I can't lose--

9
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:31,740
that I can put the dart
exactly where I want it.

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,325
You know the feeling.

11
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:34,910
Not today.

12
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,203
Dax to Sisko.

13
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,663
Go ahead.

14
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,832
Benjamin, there's
a priority message for you

15
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:41,583
from the Bajoran
Provisional Government.

16
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,960
On my way.

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,919
Hmm.

18
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,337
Fortunately,
duty calls.

19
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:46,714
(<i> chuckles</i> )

20
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,966
You'll have to find
yourself another victim.

21
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,345
Doctor.

22
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,639
Commander, um,
is Chief O'Brien in here?

23
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,851
He's back there...
"in the zone."

24
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:05,900
<i>Raka-ja ut shala morala</i>

Enter.

29
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,751
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,586
I... I didn't
mean to interrupt.

31
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,086
Oh, that's all right.

32
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:28,714
It's called a<i> duranja.</i>

33
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:30,674
It's a lamp for the dead.

34
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,927
I was just...
praying for Bareil.

35
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:34,762
What can I do for you?

36
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:35,971
This may come

37
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,723
as somewhat of a shock,

38
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:40,392
but I wanted you
to hear it from me.

39
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,561
The First Minister

40
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,354
of the provisional
government has died.

41
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:47,066
Kalem Apren... how?

42
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:50,151
Heart failure.
He died in his sleep.

43
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,820
Ah...

44
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,740
Well, I just met him once,

45
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,575
but he seemed like
he was a good man.

46
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:59,703
How soon will they appoint
someone to replace him?

47
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,205
They have already
appointed someone.

48
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:06,418
The new head of the
provisional government

49
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:09,588
is Kai Winn.

50
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,676
...so as a result,

51
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,929
I've transferred
Ensign Palmers

52
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,847
back to the night watch

53
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,558
and reassigned Crewman
Donark to the<i> Defiant</i>

54
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,685
as a member of
the security detachment.

55
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,731
Starfleet is sending
a series of upgrades

56
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:35,525
for our tactical computer
modules next week.

57
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,903
I've drawn up a plan
to phase in the upgrades

58
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,530
over the course
of three days.

59
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,657
Major...

60
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:43,992
is something wrong?

61
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,121
Yes.

62
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,499
Oh, it's this whole thing
with Kai Winn.

63
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,960
I was just trying
to get used to her

64
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,628
as spiritual leader of Bajor,

65
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,923
and now she's running
the government, Odo?

66
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,050
Not an ideal
situation.

67
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,593
Well, I'm beginning
to think you and I

68
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,262
are the only ones
who feel that way.

69
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:06,681
No one is opposing her
in next month's elections.

70
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,726
She is going to be
elected the First Minister

71
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:13,396
for the next six years,
and no one seems to care.

72
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,857
Well, you and I have
a different perspective

73
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,777
than most Bajorans.

74
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:21,863
There's a personal element
to our feelings about her.

75
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,701
I know that you
still blame Winn

76
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,536
for Bareil's death.

77
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,707
That's part of it...

78
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:36,461
but this is about
the future of Bajor.

79
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,213
I can't shake the feeling

80
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:41,758
that giving Winn control
of the government is a mistake--

81
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,136
that she should be stopped.

82
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:47,097
Stopped from
doing what?

83
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,765
I don't know.

84
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:55,396
Maybe... maybe
I'm afraid...

85
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,941
that if she's
given power,

86
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,944
she's never
going to let it go.

87
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,821
Unfortunately,
that suspicion

88
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,157
is not shared
by the people of Bajor.

89
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:08,202
They still admire her

90
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,287
as the woman who made peace
with Cardassia.

91
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,706
Bareil made peace
with Cardassia.

92
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,250
I know that, Major,

93
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,837
but to the rest of Bajor,
<i>Winn</i> is the real hero.

94
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:22,674
In their eyes, it took courage
to conclude a treaty

95
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,343
with a race that she herself

96
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:26,220
had so bitterly condemned
and fought against.

97
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,722
I don't care what
her popular image is.

98
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,349
She is no hero.

99
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:33,101
The only thing that she cares
about is her own power.

100
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,229
Why can't people see that?

101
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,190
(<i> sighs</i> )

102
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,526
We spent so many years
fighting the Cardassians.

103
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,444
We spent so much time

104
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,907
hoping and praying
for a Bajor that was free.

105
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,616
Now that we won,

106
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,952
how can people just hand over
their freedom

107
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,288
to someone like Winn?

108
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,915
It has been my observation

109
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,751
that one of the prices of giving
people freedom of choice

110
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:01,963
is that, sometimes,
they make the wrong choice.

111

Hello, child.

116
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:29,741
Eminence.

117
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,952
May I come in?

118
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,912
Yes.

119
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,833
Please forgive
this intrusion.

120
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,419
I know the hour is late.

121
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:43,380
Does Commander Sisko know
you're aboard the station?

122
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,632
I'm not here
to see the Emissary.

123
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,841
I'm here to see you.

124
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,176
Me?

125
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,386
Yes, child.

126
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:53,223
Have you suffered
a recent loss,

127
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,393
or are you still mourning
the death of Minister Kalem?

128
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,396
It's for Vedek Bareil...

129
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,231
actually.

130
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,607
It's been three months

131
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,860
since Bareil left us
to walk with the Prophets.

132
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,029
You must have cared
for him deeply.

133
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,239
I loved him.

134
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,657
As did I.

135
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,784
Is that why you never
mention Bareil's name

136
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,329
when you talk about
your peace treaty
with Cardassia?

137
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,123
As I recall, he's the
one who negotiated it.

138
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,791
Bareil saw himself

139
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,044
as simply carrying out
the will of the Prophets.

140
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,422
To him, achieving peace
with Cardassia

141
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,508
was its own reward.

142
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:33,054
He never wanted fame or glory
for what he did.

143
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:36,057
As someone who loved him,

144
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,477
I'm surprised
you didn't know that.

145
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,571
What is it you
want, Eminence?

146
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:56,286
Are you familiar with
Rakantha Province?

147
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,578
It's
a farming community.

148
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,247
And it used to be

149
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:03,377
one of the most productive
agricultural regions on Bajor.

150
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:04,711
But as you know,

151
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,713
the Cardassians
poisoned much

152
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,049
of our farmlands
before they left.

153
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,719
And Rakantha has been mostly
barren wasteland ever since.

154
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,471
After years
of research,

155
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,764
the Agricultural
Ministry has finally

156
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,517
developed reclamators

157
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:21,978
which can detoxify the soil
and make it fertile again.

158
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,604
It's very interesting,

159
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,274
but what does it
have to do with me?

160
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,609
Patience, child.

161
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:32,406
In six months, it will be
planting season in Rakantha.

162
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,032
By this time next year,

163
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:38,203
we can be producing boton,
moreka, and salam grass--

164
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:41,373
all valuable
commodities for export.

165
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:45,210
If we can attract
interstellar commerce to Bajor,

166
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,462
it will only enhance
our application

167
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,298
for membership
in the Federation.

168
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,008
I understand.

169
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,801
Unfortunately,

170
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,762
a group of farmers
who were allowed

171
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,765
to use the reclamators
in another province

172
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,017
are now refusing to return them,

173
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,603
and this is why
I've come to you, Kira.

174
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,481
The farmers who
seized the equipment

175
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,401
are in Dahkur Province--
your home--

176
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:13,113
and they're led by a man
with whom you're acquainted.

177
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,323
His name is Shakaar.

178
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,324
Shakaar?

179
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,243
And if I'm not
mistaken

180
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,036
he was the leader
of your resistance cell

181
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,496
during the occupation.

182
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,789
That's right.

183
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,207
I want you
to convince him

184
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,793
to return the equipment
he's stolen.

185
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:31,172
You want me to go up
against a man

186
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:35,302
who saved my life
countless times?

187
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,761
For you?

188
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,055
Not for me, child.

189
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,224
For Bajor.

190
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:48,273
I know we've had
our differences in the past,

191
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,690
but I'm asking you

192
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,401
to put those
feelings aside

193
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,070
and think of what
is best for our people.

194
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,739
We're on the verge
of a new era.

195
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,158
The occupation is over.

196
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,119
We've achieved peace
with Cardassia.

197
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:04,038
Federation membership
is only a few years away.

198
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:07,542
This is an exciting
time to be a Bajoran,

199
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,877
but our future depends
on each of us

200
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:13,714
acting for the common
good of all Bajor.

201
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:16,884
Shakaar has lost
sight of this.

202
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,637
By stealing the
reclamators,
he's acting

203
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:21,097
in his own
self-interest

204
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,558
at the expense of the
rest of our people.

205
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:26,394
No, I know Shakaar.

206
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,105
He's one of the most selfless
people I have ever met.

207
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,274
He must have a good reason
for what he's done.

208
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,568
Perhaps.

209
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:36,779
Perhaps he is just misguided.

210
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,240
That's why I've
come to you, Kira.

211
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,450
You know him.

212
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,826
You can talk to him.

213
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,912
I don't want this
to become a scandal.

214
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:49,167
I want this settled
peacefully, quietly.

215
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,837
Surely, we can both agree
that that's a worthy goal.

216
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,051
I'll talk to him,

217
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:01,179
but I can't guarantee
that he'll listen to me.

218
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,182
Vedek Bareil used to tell me

219
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,808
that you could be
quite persuasive

220
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:09,270
when you put your
mind to it, child.

221
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,481
I hope he wasn't mistaken.

222
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,441
Walk with the Prophets.

223
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,040
(<i> door buzzer</i> )

224
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,300
(<i> gasps</i> )

225
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,842
(<i> relieved sigh</i> )

226
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:24,971
You cut your hair.

227
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,600
You let yours grow.

228
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,518
I liked you
the old way.

229
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,729
I was thinking
the same thing...

230
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,855
about you.

231
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,610
(<i> laughs</i> )

232
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,612
It's good to see
you, Nerys.

233
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,196
It's good
to see you, too.

234
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,281
Come on in.

235
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:50,413
So, Major Kira Nerys,

236
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:54,833
Deep Space 9's
First Officer...

237
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,043
you've made quite
a name for yourself.

238
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,587
Not really.

239
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:58,672
You've accomplished
a great deal.

240
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,839
You should be proud.

241
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,717
Furel and Lupaza
are so proud of you,

242
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:03,926
they actually stand
a little taller

243
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,720
every time
your name comes up.

244
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,764
Furel and Lupaza?
You still see them?

245
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,432
Of course.

246
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,850
They both have farms less
than ten kilometers from here.

247
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,561
Those two are farmers?!

248
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,813
Now, you, yes.

249
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,230
That's all you
ever talked about.

250
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,775
But Lupaza?

251
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,360
How did<i> that</i> happen?

252
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,861
You can ask her yourself.

253
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,655
They'll be here
in a couple of hours.

254
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,782
I can hardly wait to see
the look on their faces

255
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,868
when they walk through that door
and see you standing there.

256
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,500
Shakaar...

257
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,504
before they get
here, we should talk.

258
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,297
I'm here on business.

259
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:45,051
I know why you're here, Nerys.

260
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,136
I need time to think about it,
all right?

261
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,806
All right.

262
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:15,915
I think I'll stick
to<i> tongo</i> from now on.

263
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,000
Sorry, Lieutenant.

264
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,669
QUARK:
Thank you.

265
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,630
Thank you all
for your gaming business.

266
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,048
The house will
start taking bets

267
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:27,301
on the next challenger
at 10 to 1.

268
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,762
That's 10 to 1
without even knowing...

269
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:29,846
Quark?

270
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,431
...who the next challenger
will be.

271
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,182
Quark, I have to go.

272
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,601
Uh... no problem.

273
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:35,894
Ladies and gentlemen,

274
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:39,146
Chief of Operations
Miles Edward O'Brien

275
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,565
has to leave
to resume his duties

276
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,025
on board the station.

277
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:46,987
Now, everyone,
make way.

278
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,657
I trust we'll be seeing
you again tomorrow, Chief,

279
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,410
for your 47th
straight victory?

280
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,870
I don't know.

281
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,246
I was actually thinking
of getting some time

282
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,539
in the holosuites
tomorrow.

283
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:57,791
The holosuites?

284
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:58,917
You weren't thinking

285
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,126
of going kayaking,
by any chance?

286
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,294
As a matter
of fact, I was.

287
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,296
Uh... didn't I tell you?

288
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,214
I misplaced
the kayaking program.

289
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,215
Oh...

290
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,258
Haven't seen it in days.

291
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,635
Quark...

292
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,846
All right.
Look...

293
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:15,475
you're on a streak,
an epic streak.

294
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,684
If you go
kayaking tomorrow

295
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,604
and something happens
and you damage

296
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:23,316
that golden shoulder,
this streak will be over.

297
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,567
And you'll never know

298
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:27,862
just how far
it might have taken you.

299
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,989
Could you really
live with that?

300
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,743
Uh... you're
offering 10 to 1

301
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,787
to anyone betting
against me tomorrow?

302
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,288
That's right.

303
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:40,124
I'd make it 15,
if I were you.

304
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,212
(<i> quietly</i> ):
Yes.

305
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:54,597
(<i> laughing</i> )

306
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,432
You never would've found
your way out of there

307
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,726
if I hadn't left
that marker on that rock.

308
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,603
I have a fine
sense of direction.

309
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,772
I knew exactly
where I was that
night, exactly.

310
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,649
I found your tracks
the next day.

311
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,233
You'd been walking in circles.

312
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,696
I was throwing
the Cardassians off my trail.

313
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,322
(<i> laughter</i> )

314
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,450
Again, please.

315
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:20,790
Furel-- if you
don't mind my asking--

316
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,333
why haven't you...?

317
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,629
Had my arm replaced?

318
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,047
Well, I thought
about it.

319
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,257
I even saw a Federation
doctor about it.

320
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,093
She said, "No
problem, Furel.

321
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,221
"You can have a new arm
in less than a week.

322
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,140
"It'll have full
range of motion

323
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,101
and... it'll feel
just like your own."

324
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,187
So, why didn't
you do it?

325
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,150
Well... before I went

326
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,863
into that
interrogation center...

327
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,406
(<i> sighs</i> )

328
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,408
I asked the Prophets
to give me the strength

329
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,912
to get the rest of you
out of there.

330
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,581
And, well, in exchange, I...

331
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,626
I said I'd give up my life.

332
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,508
Well, as it turned out,

333
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,511
I was able
to rescue you, Shakaar,

334
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,598
and Lupaza,

335
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,601
and it only
cost me an arm.

336
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:25,939
I felt the...
the Prophets were generous.

337
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:30,568
Somehow,
replacing the arm seems...

338
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,612
ungrateful.

339
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,282
I think you're just afraid
that with two arms

340
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,910
you'd actually have to do
some<i> real</i> work for a change.

341
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,913
I have done more work
in three months on my farm

342
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:43,873
than you have done
in three years!

343
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,667
I have seen better weeds
than the crops you grow.

344
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,710
You know
good and well

345
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,253
that my soil's more toxic

346
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,505
than any other farm tract
within 100 kilometers.

347
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,299
Ha!
It's true!

348
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,802
Once I get a chance to use
one of the reclamators,

349
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,054
things will change,
I can promise you that.

350
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:01,223
You may not get
that chance, Lupaza.

351
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:05,227
Nerys was sent here by the Kai,
with orders to convince us

352
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,397
to return the reclamators
to the government.

353
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,524
And you said no.

354
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,652
I said I'd have
to think about it.

355
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:13,945
LUPAZA:
There's not much

356
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:16,656
to think about, Shakaar,
you know that.

357
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,825
Tell the Kai, or
the First Minister

358
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,952
or whatever she wants
to be called these days,

359
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:22,662
that the answer is no.

360
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:26,499
We need the reclamators,
and that's the end of it.

361
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:30,252
Now, who wants tuwaly pie?

362
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,393
You know, this business
with the reclamators

363
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,939
isn't going to just
go away, Shakaar.

364
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,315
Maybe not.

365
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,400
Definitely not.

366
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,737
I think you
should reconsider.

367
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,365
I know what you're
trying to do here,

368
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,742
and I know how
difficult it's been.

369
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,832
We have to think about
what's best for Bajor.

370
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,127
If you think giving
the reclamators back

371
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,129
to the government
is the best thing for Bajor,

372
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,421
then you've been out

373
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,882
on that space station
for too long.

374
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,718
We waited
three years

375
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,594
to get the reclamators.

376
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,262
We finally got them
two months ago,

377
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:26,934
and we were told they were ours
for at least a year.

378
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,854
The provisional government

379
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,939
actually did something right
for a change.

380
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:35,693
(<i> sighs</i> )

381
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:39,446
Then Minister Kalem died.

382
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:42,700
And the next thing we know,
we get an order

383
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:47,371
to return
the reclamators immediately

384
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,749
to the Rakantha Farming Project.

385
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,584
The Rakantha Project
is important.

386
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,002
If they can get it underway,

387
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,129
Bajor could start exporting
goods again.

388
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:56,714
It could start
to change the way

389
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:58,298
the rest of the galaxy
looks at us.

390
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,927
They'll stop seeing us
as poor refugees

391
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,428
and start seeing us as equals.

392
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,138
I don't give a damn

393
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,557
how the rest of
the galaxy<i> looks</i> at us.

394
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,144
We're trying to feed
our own people here,

395
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:12,354
and you're talking
about exports.

396
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,107
(<i> sighs</i> )

397
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:17,151
There must be a way to reach
some kind of compromise here.

398
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,611
How?

399
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,113
I don't know,
but if you and the Kai

400
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,322
would sit down
and talk together,

401
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,366
maybe you can reach
some kind of agreement--

402
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,326
some way of sharing

403
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,995
the equipment
more fairly.

404
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,371
If I could arrange
a meeting

405
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,623
between the two
of you,

406
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,291
would you at least agree
to sit down

407
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,876
and talk with her about it?

408
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,046
I don't know
if it'll accomplish anything.

409
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:40,841
It might not,
but it's a place to start.

410
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:44,344
All right...

411
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,763
for<i> you.</i>

412
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,484
It's good to have
you home, Nerys.

413
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:02,155
You should come
back more often.

414
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,073
I might do that.

415
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,783
Well, good.

416
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:08,452
Because we've
all missed you.

417
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:12,456
Especially me.

418
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:30,641
Am I to assume, my child,
that you've met with Shakaar?

419
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,437
We talked.

420
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:38,732
And have you convinced him
to return the soil reclamators?

421
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:41,194
He's not ready
to return them yet.

422
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:42,820
I see.

423
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,864
When can we expect
their return?

424
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,782
When the topsoil
in Dahkur Province

425
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,909
has been restored and
readied for planting--

426
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,368
another six months.

427
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,122
In six months,
the planting season

428
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:55,249
in Rakantha will be over.

429
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,754
I realize that.

430
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:05,634
And I know how important
the Rakantha Project is,

431
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,137
which is why I've
arranged a meeting

432
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,722
between the
two of you.

433
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,015
A meeting?

434
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,391
Yes, to work out
a compromise.

435
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:14,852
If you just hear him out

436
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,896
and look at the work
they've been able

437
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,523
to accomplish in Dahkur
in just two months,

438
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,942
you'll see how important
this is to them.

439
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:25,196
I'm sure there's a way
to resolve this situation

440
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:28,157
so that both Rakantha
<i>and</i> Dahkur can benefit.

441
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:30,450
Did you explain to Shakaar
that you were there

442
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,371
on the direct authority
of the First Minister?

443
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:37,457
Yes, but it wouldn't have
mattered if I was there

444
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,335
on behalf of the
Prophets, themselves.

445
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,670
He wasn't about to just
give up the equipment.

446
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:45,632
A pity.

447
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:49,553
Shakaar sounds like
a prideful and arrogant man.

448
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,890
It also seems there's
no reasoning with him.

449
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,684
Shakaar is not
an unreasonable man.

450
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,562
He is desperate.
They all are.

451
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,940
You should see what
they're up against--

452
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,775
the condition of the
soil, the harsh weather.

453
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,735
I'm sure if you talk to him

454
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:07,321
you'll be able to
work out a compromise.

455
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:10,741
It would seem
that I have little choice.

456
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,579
So, I can tell him
that you'll discuss it with him?

457
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,497
You can tell him that,

458
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:20,500
and then you can return
to Deep Space 9.

459
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,296
But I can still serve
as intermediary

460
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,713
between you and Shakaar.

461
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,048
That won't be
necessary.

462
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:27,967
You've done enough already.

463
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:32,263
And please, give my best regards
to Commander Sisko.

464
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,979
That will be all, my child.

465
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,662
I'll be interested to hear
what she has to say,

466
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,789
but, uh, she's not getting
those reclamators back

467
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:00,249
till we're finished with them.

468
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,209
Shakaar, you have
to be flexible.

469
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,086
I'm not sure this is
a fight you can win.

470
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:06,546
That's what
the Cardassians
used to say.

471
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,714
(<i> door buzzer</i> )

472
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:08,966
Come in.

473
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:12,510
Are you Shakaar?

474
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,595
Yes.

475
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,097
You're
under arrest.

476
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:17,350
Wait a minute.
On whose authority?

477
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,809
Our orders came
directly from

478
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,602
the Office of
the First Minister.

479
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,770
She lied to me.

480
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,563
She's good
at it, Nerys.

481
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,648
Don't feel bad.

482
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,233
If you'll
come with us.

483
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,525
Yeah, all right.

484
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:30,446
I just want to make
one thing clear.

485
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,827
Glad to see that living
on a space station

486
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:37,953
hasn't slowed you down.

487
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,205
We have to get
out of here.

488
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:41,499
This can still be
explained away.

489
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:43,709
It was a tense
situation.

490
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,461
You acted on instinct.

491
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:47,296
They'll understand that,

492
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:49,965
but they won't understand
you coming with me.

493
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,343
This isn't
your fight, Nerys.

494
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:54,220
Go home.

495
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,472
I<i> am</i> home, Shakaar.

496
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:59,016
And I have been lied to
by Kai Winn for the last time.

497
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:01,727
She wants a fight,
I'll give her one.

498
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,443
FUREL:
The civil police
have issued

499
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:11,904
a province-wide alert
for you and Kira.

500
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:15,491
They've also requested
that the surrounding towns

501
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,451
send more troops
and equipment

502
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:19,286
to help in the search
for the fugitives.

503
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,372
Now there's a
familiar word.

504
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:23,832
Haven't been called
that in a while.

505
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,167
I kind of missed it.

506
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:28,754
The authorities
have seized your farm,

507
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:31,090
and they've brought in
a scanning machine

508
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,966
to hunt for the reclamators.

509
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,218
Let them scan.

510
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:35,344
There's nothing
there to find.

511
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,929
They've also
detained

512
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,847
some of the other members
of our resistance cell

513
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,140
for "questioning."

514
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,350
Who?

515
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,227
Mobara, Klin,
and Ornak

516
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:45,354
were taken away
before I could reach them.

517
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:48,232
The others are heading for
the Kola Mountain stronghold.

518
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,776
I said we'd meet them there
and go over our plan.

519
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,861
Well, what<i> is</i> our plan?

520
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,490
For now, the plan
is to keep moving.

521
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,867
We'll let the civil police
run themselves ragged

522
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,286
chasing us through
the mountains.

523
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:01,870
Just like old times.

524
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,039
That's the general idea.

525
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,458
The Cardassians
spent ten years

526
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,000
searching for us
in these mountains.

527
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,504
The civil police will probably
give up in ten days.

528
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:12,131
KIRA:
I'm not so sure
about that.

529
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:14,091
Some of them were
in the resistance, too.

530
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:15,884
They might not
give up so easily.

531
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,845
Maybe, but I really don't think
they want to hunt down

532
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,931
a group of fellow Bajorans
who are just trying

533
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:22,182
to defend
their homes.

534
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,850
Hmm.

535
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,811
We head for
Kola Mountain

536
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,187
pick up anybody who's there,

537
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,815
then move further
into the hill country.

538
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,066
Well, let's go.

539
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:43,996
Yes!

540
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,247
A most
auspicious shot.

541
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:46,415
You got him, Chief.

542
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:47,583
One in the bull
and you win.

543
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,084
I think he knows
that, Julian.

544
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,878
Don't worry, Coach,
I won't let you down.

545
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,839
I see no reason
for delay.

546
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,133
Throw the dart.

547
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,801
I will throw the dart

548
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,595
when I'm ready
to throw the dart.

549
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:00,720
Did I miss
anything?

550
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,721
Shh!

551
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,015
Is that my synthale?

552
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,100
Extra stout-- just
the way you like it.

553
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,852
Excuse me.

554
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:07,853
Here you go.

555
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,188
(<i> painful groan</i> )

556
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,314
What is it?

557
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:11,482
BASHIR:
It's his shoulder.

558
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:12,608
Popped out of
its socket.

559
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:13,775
Get me the tricorder.

560
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,860
QUARK:
What did I do?

561
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,445
I just handed him a drink.

562
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,989
It's all right, just-just
pop it back in, Julian.

563
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:20,324
I'll-I'll be all right.

564
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:21,617
Oh, no, I'm afraid

565
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,369
it's not that simple
this time, Chief.

566
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,329
You've got
a rotator cuff tear

567
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:27,080
and severe
degenerative damage.

568
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,541
We'd better get him
to the Infirmary.

569
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:31,418
If he leaves the line,
he forfeits the game.

570
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,961
Forfeit?

571
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,171
This man needs surgery.

572
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,172
Surgery!

573
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:36,590
That's right, Chief.

574
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,717
I may have to replace
the entire humeral socket.

575
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,719
It's not
a complicated procedure.

576
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,928
We can postpone the rest

577
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,972
of this competition
until tomorrow,

578
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,099
at which time,
he will be good as new.

579
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,560
I don't make
the rules.

580
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,019
I merely follow them.

581
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,104
Wait, wait, wait... look...

582
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,857
I'm in the zone!

583
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:58,362
I just need...

584
00:28:58,362 --> 00:28:59,821
(<i> painful groan</i> )

585
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,366
Oh, I just need surgery.

586
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:04,618
(<i> groaning</i> )

587
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:11,709
I believe the house
is paying 15 to 1.

588
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,799
All I did was
hand him a drink.

589
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:29,768
Emissary, I'm so happy you
came to consult with me.

590
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,730
Frankly, I'm surprised
you wanted my advice.

591
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,898
The advice
of the Emissary

592
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,650
is always welcome,

593
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,652
but what I need
is your help.

594
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:40,738
What kind of help?

595
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:42,906
It's been two weeks

596
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,783
since I was forced
to send the militia

597
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,535
into Dahkur Province.

598
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,078
And?

599
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:51,582
And they've yet to
catch sight of Shakaar

600
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:53,459
or any of his followers,

601
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,753
let alone take them
into custody.

602
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:57,379
I guess now you know

603
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,757
how the Cardassians
must have felt.

604
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:02,968
The point is

605
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,470
I can't let this
go on much longer.

606
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,765
It embarrasses me
to say this,

607
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:10,601
but Shakaar's defiance
seems to be catching on

608
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:13,103
in some of the other provinces.

609
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:15,689
And I've had to take certain...

610
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:18,609
unfortunate actions
to maintain order.

611
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:20,235
You mean declaring martial law

612
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:23,656
and suspending local government
in the hill provinces?

613
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:26,659
I wasn't aware
that you kept such close watch

614
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:28,952
on the Bajoran
political situation.

615
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,663
From what I understand,

616
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:33,749
Shakaar is gaining support
all over Bajor.

617
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:36,960
Is that what Major Kira's
been telling you?

618
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,422
I haven't spoken with Major Kira
in quite some time.

619
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:45,010
Emissary, I don't want
this issue

620
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,804
to divide my people.

621
00:30:46,804 --> 00:30:50,265
Then I advise withdrawing
your troops from Dahkur.

622
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,309
I'm more than willing
to do that.

623
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:53,893
On one condition.

624
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,937
And what might that be?

625
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:59,941
I'd like you to provide
a Federation security force

626
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,819
to take their place.

627
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:07,115
You want me
to bring in Shakaar for you.

628
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:10,494
Such an act would do much
to solidify the relations

629
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,912
between the Federation
and Bajor.

630
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:16,416
I wasn't aware that our
relationship needed solidifying.

631
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,418
Nevertheless,
this would be an opportunity

632
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,962
for the Federation
to show, once again,

633
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,006
its friendship for Bajor.

634
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:29,471
I'm sorry,
but Federation law prevents me

635
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:32,015
from interfering
in Bajoran internal affairs.

636
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,893
So...

637
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,815
you're refusing my request
for aid?

638
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:44,486
I suppose I am.

639
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,824
If Bajor cannot depend
on the Federation,

640
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:52,619
we'll withdraw our application
for membership.

641
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,038
That would be
an unfortunate
overreaction

642
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,540
on your part.

643
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,751
If I may say so,
your entire response

644
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:01,628
to this crisis
has been an overreaction.

645
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:04,339
By using the militia
against your own people,

646
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,632
you're risking civil war

647
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,009
over a couple of...
soil reclamators.

648
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:12,472
I'm afraid you can't see
what's really going on here.

649
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,349
This isn't about

650
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,851
soil reclamators.

651
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,686
This is about
the future

652
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:19,438
of our society.

653
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:22,649
When someone like Shakaar
can defy the law

654
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,526
and escape punishment,

655
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:28,154
we risk descending
into anarchy and chaos.

656
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,699
This is
a test...

657
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,910
a test by the Prophets.

658
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,748
They want to see if I'm worthy
of the role they've given me

659
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:40,166
as First Minister and Kai.

660
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,669
I will not
fail them.

661
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:46,172
I will stop Shakaar
by any means necessary.

662
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,604
Move, move, move!

663
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,916
(<i> all panting</i> )

664
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:25,921
They're closing.

665
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:26,922
75 meters.

666
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:27,881
Come on, Kira.

667
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:29,424
I've almost got it.

668
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,134
They're on the ridge.

669
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:46,149
Kira, if you can't do it,
tell me now.

670
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,776
I got it.

671
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,951
New reading.
700 meters, that way.

672
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:57,118
Yes, sir.

673
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,286
Let's go.

674
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,041
How long do we have?

675
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,877
I've projected
the false life signs

676
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:06,879
about 700 meters
past that ravine.

677
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:08,005
It'll take them
about an hour

678
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:09,255
to cover that distance,

679
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:13,385
another 15 to realize
what's happened.

680
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,596
Either I am getting older

681
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,432
or these mountains
are getting higher.

682
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,976
The next time I start
getting nostalgic

683
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:24,897
for the old days,
shoot me.

684
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:27,315
If you insist.

685
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:33,488
They're good.

686
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,114
Half of them are
from Dahkur Province.

687
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,115
They know this terrain

688
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,159
almost as well
as we do.

689
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,037
I think you're right.

690
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:41,621
We need to leave Dahkur.

691
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,206
They'll box us in if
we stay much longer.

692
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:46,001
We could take Serpent's Ridge
to Retosha Pass

693
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:47,252
and head for Lonar Province.

694
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,171
(<i> sighs</i> )

695
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,758
Serpent's Ridge
is pretty rugged territory.

696
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:54,676
I don't think
we have much choice.

697
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,553
Yes, we do.

698
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,061
We can turn and fight.

699
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:05,478
He's right, Shakaar.

700
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,146
It's just like in the old days.

701
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:09,066
Every once in a while, the
Cardassians would get too close,

702
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:11,985
and we'd turn around
and give them a bloody nose.

703
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:16,990
Sometimes it was our nose
that got bloodied.

704
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,826
We were willing
to take the chance.

705
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:24,873
Now, I'll follow whatever orders
you give...

706
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,833
but I am tired of running.

707
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,963
Kira?

708
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:33,673
I'm not sure we can
keep up this pace.

709
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,886
All right.

710
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,179
We head for Tanis Canyon.

711
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,848
Kira's on point.

712
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:42,849
Column of twos behind her.

713
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,101
Lupaza, you take
up the rear.

714
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:45,936
There is no way out
of Tanis Canyon.

715
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:47,270
And that's why
we're going to lead

716
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,689
those militia
troops in there.

717
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,900
'Cause we're going
to be waiting for them.

718
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,401
Let's move!

719
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,756
I don't think
they've picked us up

720
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:16,382
on their tricorders.

721
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,217
They won't either, not with
that dampening field in place.

722
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,698
I think I recognize that man.

723
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:40,740
Which one?

724
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,908
The Colonel.

725
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,410
That's Lenaris Holem.

726
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,829
Lenaris...

727
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:48,498
from the Ornathia
resistance cell.

728
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:52,335
I met him at a reception
in the capital about a year ago.

729
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,921
He's good.

730
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,756
No wonder we haven't lost them.

731
00:36:56,756 --> 00:37:00,052
We'll have to get him
with the first volley.

732
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:02,679
You take the Lieutenant
on the right.

733
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,056
I'll take Lenaris.

734
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,209
(<i> sighs</i> )

735
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:34,002
I can't.

736
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,336
I'm sorry.

737
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,089
Don't be.

738
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,760
I can't either.

739
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,977
Hold.

740
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,404
Set a perimeter,
and watch the hills.

741
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,405
SOLDIER:
Yes, sir.

742
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,573
B Team,
left flank.

743
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,998
Nobody fires until
I give the order.

744
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:12,999
SOLDIER:
Aye, sir.

745
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,793
Firing positions,
hold!

746
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:27,264
That's far enough.

747
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,475
Shakaar?

748
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,687
Kira Nerys.

749
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,773
We've met.

750
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:39,609
I've wanted to thank you
for a long time.

751
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:43,362
I had a brother at Gallitep
when you liberated the camp.

752
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,448
A lot of people did.

753
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:48,034
I just wish we'd
gotten there sooner.

754
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:53,623
Well, I take it
from your calm demeanor

755
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:56,042
that I've walked into an ambush.

756
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,670
I should have stayed up
on the ridgeline,

757
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,713
never come down into the valley.

758
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,966
It's an easy mistake to make.

759
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:05,218
You thought we were
another two kilometers ahead,

760
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:07,679
so you tried to make up time.

761
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,514
I might have done
the same thing.

762
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:13,185
I think I should tell you
I've been in worse situations.

763
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:15,061
The Pullock V raid.

764
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,189
You know about that?

765
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:19,607
The first off-world raid
against the Cardassians.

766
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,734
Of course.

767
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,528
It was a bold move.

768
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,864
If you know about Pullock V

769
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:29,826
then you should also know I
won't give up without a fight.

770
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,577
If you're here
to ask me to surrender,

771
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,621
you're wasting
your time.

772
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,958
That's not why I'm here.

773
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:39,919
I want to take my people
and walk out of here.

774
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,255
I want
to take them home.

775
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:46,926
Wait!

776
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,011
Stop, stop!

777
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,095
No one shoot!
No one shoot!

778
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,722
Cease fire!
Cease fire!

779
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,099
Hold your fire!

780
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:56,769
(<i> panting</i> )

781
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:07,697
Sir, I saw someone.

782
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:10,408
I thought they were
going to open fire.

783
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,244
Lieutenant.

784
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:15,163
Take this man's weapon

785
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:17,749
and get him off
the perimeter.

786
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,088
Now, I believe
you were saying something

787
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:24,672
about wanting
to walk out of here?

788
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:25,840
That's right.

789
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,425
You know that's
impossible.

790
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,761
Well, we better find a way
to make it possible,

791
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,263
because the next time
someone starts shooting,

792
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:32,889
we won't be able to stop it.

793
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,599
And I'm not talking about today.

794
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,602
I'm talking about tomorrow
and the next day and the next.

795
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:40,563
I am talking about
the beginning of a civil war.

796
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,399
SHAKAAR:
I didn't fight
the Cardassians

797
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:46,069
for 25 years just so I could
start shooting other Bajorans.

798
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,532
Neither did I.

799
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:54,911
So... what do we do about it?

800
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,129
(<i> bell rings</i> )

801
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:05,671
What is it?

802
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:08,341
WOMAN: Colonel Lenaris
is here to see you.

803
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:10,093
Send him in.

804
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:21,520
I see you've brought me
a pair of gifts.

805
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,522
How thoughtful of you.

806
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,193
They're not my prisoners.

807
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:31,072
What do you mean,
they're not your prisoners?

808
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:32,324
What's going on?

809
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:34,659
I'm here to enter
the election

810
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:38,246
as a candidate
for the Office
of First Minister.

811
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,500
You have an interesting
sense of humor.

812
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,127
KIRA:
It's no joke.

813
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:46,129
Shakaar is going
to enter the election,

814
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:47,505
and you are going to lose.

815
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,507
I've consulted with
the other army commands,

816
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,677
and he has
their full support.

817
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,055
So, this is a coup?

818
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,141
No.
It's a free election.

819
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:00,185
If you want to run,
go ahead.

820
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:02,979
But if you do,
this entire incident

821
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:04,356
is going
to be made public.

822
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:06,107
And when the people
know the real facts--

823
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:09,486
when they know that you
risked a civil war

824
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:12,571
over a couple of pieces
of farm equipment--

825
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:15,367
they're never going
to trust you again.

826
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:18,161
You'll still be Kai--

827
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:22,499
the spiritual
leader of Bajor--

828
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:25,584
but your days in this office
are numbered.

829
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:30,006
So, if I were you...

830
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:32,050
I'd start packing.

831
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,859
How does it feel?

832
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:52,278
Good, so far.

833
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,738
Let's see...

834
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,660
Well, try it
again, Chief.

835
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,288
Nah...

836
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,416
I can feel it.

837
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:06,334
I'm out of the zone.

838
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:07,835
You know...

839
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,337
I've played sports
all my life,

840
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:10,422
and I've never been
in the zone

841
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:12,215
like that before.

842
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:14,633
Probably never
will again.

843
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:17,011
But it felt good
while it lasted.

844
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,763
Well, look on
the bright side.

845
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,265
Now you have
a new shoulder

846
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:22,267
you might finally finish
that kayaking program.

847
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,310
Hey... you may be right.

848
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,187
Quark...

849
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:28,273
I need a holosuite.

850
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:35,613
Doctor...

851
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,908
welcome to "the zone."

852
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:41,660
Let me tell you

853
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,414
about a<i> little</i> thing
I can do...

854
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:48,167
Have any other candidates
entered the election?

855
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,544
Oh, one or two, but
Shakaar's popularity

856
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:51,003
is growing so fast,

857
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:53,172
I don't think anyone can
catch him at this point.

858
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,507
What about the Kai?

859
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:56,551
She's trying to make
the best of it.

860
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:57,760
She even put out

861
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,555
a statement
of support for Shakaar.

862
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:02,056
Oh! You know...

863
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:05,059
I used to<i> enjoy</i> sleeping
on the ground.

864
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,145
It's good
to have you back, Major.

865
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:08,480
It's good to be back, sir.

866
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,315
I'll see you
in Ops.

867
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:16,488
(<i> sighs</i> )
