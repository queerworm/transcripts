00:00:01,836 --> 00:00:04,338
<i>Last time on</i>
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...

2
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:06,089
One of our
listening posts

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,341
in the
Gamma Quadrant

4
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:08,843
picked this up
a few minutes ago.

5
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:10,427
It looks like
a Cardassian military code,

6
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,220
but the computer
doesn't recognize it.

7
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,889
It was a call for help...

8
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:14,974
from Enabran Tain.

9
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,434
We must warn the station.

10
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,353
There is only one reason
for the Dominion

11
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,313
to hide such a large fleet
this close to the wormhole.

12
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:23,273
You think they're planning
to attack the Alpha Quadrant?

13
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,776
There's no way
we can beat the Dominion.

14
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,903
Our only hope is
to prevent their fleet

15
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,905
from entering
the Alpha Quadrant.

16
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,782
You're going to destroy
the wormhole?

17
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,492
You have to trust me.

18
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:36,411
Things are going to change
on Cardassia.

19
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,873
What things?
I don't have
time to explain.

20
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:40,499
You're leaving now.

21
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:42,751
I can't go.
It's him, isn't it?!

22
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,586
That despicable tailor.

23
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,839
You don't want to leave
because you're waiting for him?

24
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:50,509
This is Internment Camp 371.

25
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:53,470
You are here because you
are enemies of the Dominion.

26
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,930
You're<i> not</i> my son.

27
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,098
Father, you're dying.

28
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,309
For once in your life,

29
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,102
speak the truth.

30
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,440
(<i> groaning</i> )

31
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,026
General Martok.

32
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:08,986
The changeling that replaced me

33
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:12,197
has caused the death
of countless Klingons.

34
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,949
It is a grave dishonor.

35
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,951
I can only imagine
what my replacement

36
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,036
is up to on the station.

37
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,333
(<i> alarm beeping</i> )

38
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,418
We're losing it.

39
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,423
What happened?
Someone sabotaged
the emitter array.

40
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,428
Battle stations!

41
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:35,679
(<i> alarm blares</i> )

42
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:37,932
<i>And now the conclusion.</i>

43
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,861
Release docking clamps.

44
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:54,281
Clamps released.
Shields up.

45
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,033
Power to phasers
and quantum torpedoes.

46
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,826
Weapons ready.

47
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,578
Bring us around.

48
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:09,421
Dukat's bird-of-prey
is in position.

49
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,381
Maintain communications
blackout.

50
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,885
Nobody fires until we have
our orders from Captain Sisko.

51
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,678
There sure are a lot of them.

52
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,807
That'll just make it
harder for us to miss.

53
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,517
They're still not
responding to our hails.

54
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,686
I think they're trying
to intimidate us.

55
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,814
It's working.

56
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,485
I don't believe it.

57
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,821
The Dominion ships are
turning away from the station.

58
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,072
They're laying in
a new course.

59
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,115
Heading?

60
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:38,826
Straight for Cardassia.

61
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,748
Dukat's ship
is breaking formation.

62
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,334
He's going after
the Dominion fleet.

63
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,086
Open a channel.

64
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,046
KIRA:
Dukat, stop trying
to be a hero.

65
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,297
Get back to the station.

66
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,591
Your concern
is touching, Major.

67
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,844
But I think you
misunderstand me.

68
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,554
I'm not attacking
the Dominion fleet.

69
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,765
I'm joining it.

70
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,433
What are you talking about?

71
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,310
I'm afraid I have
a confession

72
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,645
to make, Major.

73
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:07,980
For the past few months,

74
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,691
I've been conducting
secret negotiations

75
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,276
between the Dominion
and Cardassia.

76
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,237
And as of last week,
Cardassia has agreed

77
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:18,490
to become part of the Dominion.

78
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,450
You can't be serious.

79
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,785
Good-bye, Major.

80
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,788
You and I on the same side...

81
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:30,502
it never seemed quite...
right... did it?

82
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,212
Lock phasers.
Open fire.

83
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,091
Too late.
He's gone.

84
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,681
All clear.

85
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,433
The transmitter Tain used
to contact the station,

86
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,685
where is it?

87
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,004
You have to crawl
through that hole

88
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,964
and kind of slide your way
up into the wall.

89
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,841
It took him
over a year

90
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,010
to modify the old
life-support system
into a transmitter.

91
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,679
How did he operate it?
He wired the message
and the transmission

92
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,097
coordinates directly into
the system's circuitry.

93
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,724
That way, all
he had to do

94
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,059
was connect
the transmitter

95
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,768
to the power grid
and let it run.

96
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,230
Could the coordinates
and the message be changed?

97
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,940
You're planning
to contact the runabout.

98
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,068
We could activate
the transporter

99
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,277
and beam ourselves
onto the ship.

100
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,904
And run like hell.

101
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,906
Re-encoding
the transmitter won't be easy.

102
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,657
We'd have to reconfigure
the array

103
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,326
one circuit at a time.

104
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,410
Can you do it?
Me?

105
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,453
I'm no engineer.

106
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,039
Neither is Mr. Worf here.

107
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,208
You, on the other hand,
my dear Mr. Garak,

108
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,584
are a man of many
hidden talents.

109
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,960
Hmm.
If you
can't do it

110
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,880
nobody can.
It's nice to feel needed.

111
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,465
JEM'HADAR:
All prisoners
assemble immediately.

112
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,800
I repeat:

113
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,595
All prisoners
assemble immediately.

114
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,352
Who is that?

115
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,396
Deyos. The Vorta
that runs this camp.

116
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,356
No talking.

117
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,732
Touchy, aren't they?

118
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,818
All Cardassian prisoners
step forward.

119
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,247
I am pleased
to announce

120
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,624
that hostilities between
our peoples have ended.

121
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:41,211
As of today, Cardassia
has joined the Dominion.

122
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,713
Therefore, you're all
being sent home.

123
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:47,175
Congratulations on your new
status as Dominion citizens.

124
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,642
Not you, Mr. Garak.

125
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:56,559
Excuse me?

126
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,270
You're staying.

127
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,730
Well, there must be
some misunderstanding.

128
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,858
The last time I checked,
I<i> was</i> a Cardassian.

129
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,111
But not a very popular one,
I'm afraid.

130
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,570
At least not with the head

131
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,406
of the new Cardassian
government.

132
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,032
And who would that be?

133
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,201
Gul Dukat.

134
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,748
You might ask, should we fear
joining the Dominion?

135
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,710
And I answer you,
not in the least.

136
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,214
We should embrace
the opportunity.

137
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,759
The Dominion recognizes us
for what we are--

138
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,887
the true leaders
of the Alpha Quadrant.

139
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,682
And now that we are
joined together,

140
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,934
equal partners
in all endeavors,

141
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,980
the only people with anything
to fear will be our enemies.

142
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,650
My oldest son's birthday
is in five days.

143
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,446
To him and to Cardassians
everywhere,

144
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,281
I make the following pledge:

145
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:54,409
By the time his birthday dawns,

146
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,537
there will not be
a single Klingon alive

147
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,207
inside Cardassian territory,

148
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:04,919
or a single Maquis colony
left within our borders.

149
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,006
Cardassia will be made whole.

150
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:11,885
All that we have lost
will be ours again.

151
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:17,932
And anyone who stands in our way
will be destroyed.

152
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:22,062
This I vow
with my life's blood.

153
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,106
For my son...

154
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:29,069
for all our sons.

155
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,279
Somebody tell me
this is a bad dream.

156
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,240
It's no dream.

157
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,867
Well, I've got a vow
to make, too.

158
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,870
Next time I see Dukat,
I'm going to kill him.

159
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,748
Right now, we have a more
immediate concern,

160
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,584
such as-- who sabotaged
our graviton emitters?

161
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,169
I don't know<i> who</i> it was

162
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,795
but they did a pretty
thorough job.

163
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,006
The emitters had the
exact opposite effect

164
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,258
of what we'd intended.

165
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,842
They were supposed
to collapse

166
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,802
the wormhole's
spatial matrix

167
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,221
and close it forever.

168
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,557
Instead, they made the
matrix even more stable.

169
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,808
Not even trilithium explosives
could destroy it now.

170
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,769
So the Dominion
can send reinforcements

171
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,479
through the wormhole
whenever they want.

172
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:07,441
Looks like it's time
for another round
of blood screenings.

173
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:08,816
Obviously, we have

174
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,693
a changeling infiltrator
on the station.

175
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,695
What makes you think
it's a changeling?

176
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,697
That's who I'd send.

177
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,158
I think Julian's right.

178
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,911
Odo tells me that a Bajoran
maintenance engineer

179
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,247
has been missing
ever since
the Dominion fleet

180
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,540
arrived in the
Alpha Quadrant.

181
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,250
And if that was
our changeling,

182
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,711
he's either gone or
assumed a new identity.

183
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,589
We can't afford
to take any chances.

184
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,882
I want blood screenings
and phaser sweeps.

185
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:33,925
If he's out there,

186
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:35,260
we've got
to find him.

187
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,394
MARTOK:
He's taking too much time.

188
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,728
How long has he
been in there?

189
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,896
Close to an hour.

190
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,399
Garak, how's
it coming along?

191
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,986
I only wish I were still
a member of the Obsidian Order.

192
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,697
This would make a wonderful
interrogation chamber.

193
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,199
(<i> popping</i> )

194
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,785
Tight quarters.

195
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,622
No air, bad lighting,
random electric shocks.

196
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:05,248
It's perfect.

197
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,792
BASHIR:
Sounds like you're
enjoying yourself.

198
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:11,546
If you'd like, I'd happily
trade places with you.

199
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:14,299
I suppose you could
give me a crash course
in Cardassian field engineering.

200
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,259
I should be ready to take over
from you in what?

201
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,052
Five or six weeks?
Visitors.

202
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,638
Quiet.

203
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,162
It's time.

204
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,376
I am ready.

205
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:52,837
I've been looking forward
to this.

206
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,340
So have I.

207
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,276
Give me a hand.

208
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,905
Hold on, Garak.

209
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:22,409
Wait. The guards are
still too close.

210
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,459
Just a little while
longer, Garak.

211
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,382
I thought I would
be fighting Ikat'ika.

212
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,175
I would not
be so eager

213
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,260
if I were you.

214
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,012
<i>This</i> is
his handiwork.

215
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,890
He has much to answer for.

216
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,310
His time will come.
Now remember,

217
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,104
every time
you hit the ground,

218
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,147
you must touch
one of these posts

219
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,483
or else you
forfeit the match.

220
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:59,529
Today, we train
against a worthy adversary.

221
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:03,283
Observe, analyze, remember.

222
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:07,746
Soon we will face his people
in combat.

223
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:10,206
The lessons
you learn here

224
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,832
will ensure victory.

225
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,126
Victory is life!

226
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,169
ALL:
Victory is life!

227
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,549
Begin!

228
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,345
(<i> tone sounds</i> )

229
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,430
(<i> tone sounds</i> )

230
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,278
(<i> tone sounds</i> )

231
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,545
Oh... come on.

232
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,047
(<i> grunts of competition</i> )

233
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,633
(<i> tone sounds</i> )

234
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:02,717
Clear.

235
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:20,026
Oh!<i> That</i> was
thoroughly unpleasant.

236
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,362
Are you all right?
I am fine.

237
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,656
It's just much hotter
in there than I thought.

238
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,073
I got a little
light-headed.

239
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,117
Give me a minute
and I'll go back in there.

240
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,994
No, you need more
than a minute.
Your pulse is racing.

241
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,121
I don't want to think
about your blood pressure.

242
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,415
Maybe you should wait
until tomorrow.
Do you want to get

243
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,834
off this hellhole?
You<i> know</i> I do.

244
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,418
Then let me
get back to work.

245
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,838
Rest.

246
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,548
For five minutes,
and from here on in,

247
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,633
you can take a 15-minute
break every hour.

248
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,552
Doctor's orders.

249
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:08,157
Was that the best
you have to offer?

250
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,703
He was our youngest
and least experienced.

251
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,080
I promise
your next opponent

252
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,583
will provide more
of a challenge.

253
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:32,265
View's even better
from Upper Pylon 2.

254
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,687
I keep hoping that
the wormhole will open.

255
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,731
That Garak's runabout
will come through,

256
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:42,859
and everything will
be all right again.

257
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,485
Maybe it will.

258
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,322
My father
says Garak's dead.

259
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,285
Right now, I wouldn't
believe your father

260
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,287
if he said rain was wet.

261
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:01,335
I used to think
my father was a hero.

262
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:04,255
That even when he
did something bad,

263
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,132
he had a good reason.

264
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,425
Everyone has their reasons.

265
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,427
That's what's so frightening.

266
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:12,889
People can find a way
to justify any action,

267
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,265
no matter how evil.

268
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,726
You think
my father is evil?

269
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,812
I think...

270
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:22,148
you can't judge people
by what they think...

271
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,108
or say...

272
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,277
only by what they do.

273
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:34,786
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 50564.2.</i>

274
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,704
<i>A large contingent</i>
<i>of Klingon warships</i>

275
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,998
<i>has arrived</i>
<i>from Cardassian space,</i>

276
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,625
<i>but its intentions,</i>

277
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,210
<i>at least for the moment,</i>
<i>remain unclear.</i>

278
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,420
We're being hailed.

279
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,213
It's Chancellor Gowron.

280
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,466
He's requesting
permission to dock.

281
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,301
They've got wounded.

282
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,928
Permission granted.

283
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,554
I have the feeling

284
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,849
the Klingons' war
against the Cardassians

285
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,476
has taken a turn for the worse.

286
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,480
This is a dark day.

287
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,899
Not only
for the Klingon Empire,

288
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:08,235
but for the Alpha
Quadrant itself.

289
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,279
So what are we going
to do about it?

290
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,281
I will do
what must be done.

291
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,742
Fall back, pull my forces
out of Cardassian space,

292
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,327
fortify the Klingon Empire

293
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,788
and prepare for
a fight to the death.

294
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,957
Maybe there's
a better way.

295
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,917
The Khitomer Accords?

296
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:25,920
The treaty
between the Federation

297
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,422
and the Klingon Empire
is dead.

298
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:32,927
But we can bring it
back to life again.

299
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,929
This is the most
fortified position

300
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,931
between here
and the Klingon Empire.

301
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,517
There will be a Starfleet
task force here soon.

302
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,435
If you could
bring<i> your</i> fleet here--

303
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,145
Then we could
stand united

304
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,355
against the Dominion.

305
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,983
And if we do...

306
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,527
We<i> might</i>
have a chance.

307
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,620
(<i> padd beeps</i> )

308
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,916
Think of it.

309
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,376
Five years ago,
no one had ever heard

310
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,336
of Bajor or Deep Space 9,

311
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:12,050
and now,
all our hopes rest here.

312
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,387
Where the tides
of fortune take us,

313
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:17,847
no man can know.

314
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:23,853
They're tricky, those tides.

315
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:57,177

Five matches...

320
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,922
and five victories.

321
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:39,053
You truly have the spirit
of Kahless within you.

322
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,097
Until tomorrow.

323
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,476
I'll be waiting!

324
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:48,270
You've got
three broken ribs...

325
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,689
maybe four.

326
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,190
They<i> will</i> heal.

327
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,151
Not if you keep fighting,
they won't.

328
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,653
You're lucky you didn't
puncture a lung.

329
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:56,946
A body-- even
a Klingon body--

330
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,865
can only take
so much punishment.

331
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,282
I<i> will</i> fight.

332
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,326
It is the only
honorable thing to do.

333
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,453
He'll lose, and
in this condition,

334
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,538
he might even die.

335
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,540
Then I will die.

336
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,542
But I will not yield.

337
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,418
You heard him.

338
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,337
Bandage his ribs!

339
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,925
(<i> ragged breathing</i> )

340
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,763
I'm sorry, but that's
absolutely unacceptable.

341
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,473
I'm under enough strain
as it is.

342
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,392
I can't have you quitting on me.

343
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,644
Get a hold of yourself, Garak.

344
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,814
After all, you haven't had
one of these attacks in years.

345
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:34,274
Yes, this is
a tight, enclosed space.

346
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,736
Yes, there's not a lot
of room to move.

347
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:40,531
But a disciplined mind does not
allow itself to be sidetracked

348
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:43,826
by niggling psychological
disorders like...

349
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,619
claustrophobia.

350
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:49,790
Besides, this isn't
like Tzenketh.

351
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,585
The walls won't
collapse in on you.

352
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,421
Your friends are nearby.
There's plenty of air.

353
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:59,133
So there's nothing
to be concerned about.

354
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,302
(<i> gasps</i> )

355
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,430
Focus on the job.

356
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,683
You're the only person
who can contact the runabout.

357
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,268
People are depending on you.

358
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,230
Ziyal is depending on you.

359
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,233
You promised her
you'd come back,

360
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:19,779
and that young lady has had
quite enough disappointments

361
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,906
in her life without you
adding to them.

362
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:24,158
So...

363
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:26,244
control yourself.

364
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:30,330
You're<i> stronger</i> than this.

365
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,000
A disciplined mind....

366
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,046
I'm afraid that's
the best I can do.

367
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,631
Does it feel
any better?

368
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,133
Much better.

369
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,009
You're not a very
good liar, Mr. Worf.

370
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,262
(<i> muffled bang</i> )

371
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:45,763
What was that?

372
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,266
It's coming from
inside the wall.

373
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,643
Garak.
How long has he
been in there?

374
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:51,727
About half an hour.

375
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,986
Garak, Garak,
what is it?

376
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,575
Tell him to stop
before they hear him.

377
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,828
Garak, the panel's open now.

378
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,370
You can come out.

379
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,082
We've got to get him
out of there.

380
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,336
(<i> softly</i> ):
Garak.

381
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:21,841
(<i> banging continues</i> )

382
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,759
Garak.

383
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,095
(<i> grunts</i> )

384
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,389
Garak, you
have to stop.

385
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,642
You're making
too much noise.

386
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:33,019
Garak!
(<i> grunting</i> )

387
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,436
The light...

388
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,480
the light went out.

389
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,857
I know.

390
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,025
Come on.

391
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,318
I think you can

392
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:42,695
take your break
a little early.

393
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,078
It would appear that he suffers

394
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,039
from an acute form
of claustrophobia.

395
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,748
It's a wonder that he lasted
as long as he did.

396
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,667
Then one of us
will have to finish

397
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,418
reconfiguring
the transmitter.

398
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:01,214
And who would you suggest
could do that?

399
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:03,132
Exactly.

400
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,718
If Garak can't
contact the runabout,

401
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,386
we're not
going anywhere.

402
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,647
The last of Gowron's ships
have arrived.

403
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,899
I'll have a repair crew

404
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,192
get to work on them
right away.

405
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:22,651
Any word
from Starfleet?

406
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,402
Admiral Gilhouly's
task force

407
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:26,239
is less than
four light-years away.

408
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,657
I'll feel a lot better
when they get here.

409
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,201
You're not
the only one.

410
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:31,244
KIRA:
Captain.

411
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:32,203
Yes, Major.

412
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,454
I just spoke with Odo.

413
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,540
Someone overrode
the security blocks

414
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,918
on the industrial replicator
on Level 17.

415
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,169
Sounds like our saboteur.

416
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,170
Did they catch him?

417
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,255
No such luck.

418
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:43,672
Do they know
what he replicated?

419
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,007
He wiped the memory core.

420
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:48,426
Tell Odo I want
all security details

421
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,346
to pull double shifts as of now.

422
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:53,057
If he wants more men,
have him talk to Gowron.

423
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:55,642
I'm sure the Chancellor
will be willing

424
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:58,938
to assign some Klingon troops
to guard key facilities.

425
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,815
Klingons helping
to protect Deep Space 9--

426
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,734
what an interesting concept.

427
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,694
These are
interesting times, Major.

428
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,737
DAX:
Captain.

429
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,115
Incoming message.

430
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,533
It's Gul Dukat.

431
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,202
In my office.

432
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:20,667
Dukat.

433
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,253
Please, Captain...

434
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:24,462
show a little respect--

435
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,132
you<i> are</i> talking to the head

436
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,758
of the Cardassian government.

437
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:30,303
I don't recognize
that government.

438
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:32,930
Your recognition
is irrelevant.

439
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,724
Well, if that's
what you think,

440
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,936
<i>why</i> are we having
this conversation?

441
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:40,646
Because the fact
is, Captain,

442
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:43,107
I feel a certain
obligation toward you.

443
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:46,193
After all, I freely admit,
you saved my life

444
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,070
on more than one occasion.

445
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,529
Don't remind me.

446
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,407
No, no, you should
be glad you did

447
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:54,368
because now I'm going
to return the favor...

448
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:58,038
and give you a chance to save
your precious Federation.

449
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,666
All you have to do
is convince them

450
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,751
to follow
Cardassia's example.

451
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,753
You expect us
to join the Dominion?

452
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,923
I expect you
to behave rationally.

453
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:12,136
Joining the Dominion
will save billions of lives,

454
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:15,014
<i>and</i> keep the Federation
from fading

455
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,974
into the mists of history.

456
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,851
By allowing it
to exist under Dominion rule?

457
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,853
No, thank you.

458
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,689
I'm afraid you'll like
the alternative even less.

459
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:27,360
Dukat, if you have something
to say to me, say it!

460
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,278
Then I'll make it simple.

461
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,946
A few days ago, I swore

462
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:34,325
all Cardassia lost
would be regained.

463
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:38,078
That space station
you're so fond of...

464
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,997
was built by Cardassia.

465
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:43,583
Funny, I thought it was built
by Bajoran slave labor.

466
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,504
Either surrender the station,

467
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:49,256
or I'll take it by force.

468
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,966
The choice is yours.

469
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:56,596
If you want to retake
this station, Dukat,

470
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,849
you are welcome to try.

471
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:09,485
Seven battles
and seven victories.

472
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:12,488
What hero of legend
could have done as well?

473
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:15,074
Heroes of legends
don't ache so much.

474
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:20,037
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
Your Federation friends
have taught you modesty,

475
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:23,082
but this is no time
for modesty.

476
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,459
When we return
to the Klingon Empire,

477
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:28,421
I will seek out Keedera himself

478
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:30,506
and tell him
of your glorious tale.

479
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,758
He will write a song
worthy of you.

480
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,177
Well, be sure to
send me a copy.

481
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:37,263
I'll do better
than that.

482
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:40,640
I can make sure
that he mentions you.

483
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,809
The healer that bound

484
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:46,397
the warrior's wounds,
so he could fight again.

485
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:48,982
Right now, the only part
of the song that I wish to hear

486
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,068
is the verse that tells
of our escape.

487
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,279
What good is defeating

488
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,531
every Jem'Hadar soldier
in this compound

489
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,117
if it does not bring us
closer to our freedom?

490
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,286
We have to come up with
a new escape plan.

491
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:01,828
GARAK:
That won't
be necessary.

492
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,584
The original one will work.

493
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:11,130
I just have to finish
what I started.

494
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,007
After all, a verse
about the Cardassian

495
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,801
who panicked
in the face of danger

496
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,677
would ruin
General Martok's song.

497
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:20,306
That would be
unfortunate.

498
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,101
Now, if you'll excuse me...

499
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:26,895
my dungeon awaits.

500
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:42,035
There is no greater enemy
than one's own fears.

501
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,497
It takes a brave
man to face them.

502
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,388
What can I do
for you, Chief?

503
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,056
Wasn't Lieutenant Japar
brought in here?

504
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,058
The Klingon engineer?
You just missed him.

505
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,685
The plasma burns weren't as bad
as they looked.

506
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,980
I better go find him.
I can't make head nor tail

507
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,191
of the power-relay systems
on his bird-of-prey.

508
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:14,568
We're never going to get
all these Klingon ships
up and running.

509
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,278
I have every confidence
in you, Chief.

510
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,238
Well, that makes all the
difference then, doesn't it?

511
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,533
How are Keiko and the kids?

512
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:22,909
They made it safely
to Bajor,

513
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,078
but I'm worried
about Molly.

514
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,414
She's getting old enough
to know when something's wrong.

515
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,666
I think she's scared.

516
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,917
It's only natural.
It'll pass.

517
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,794
Oh, by the way,
I ordered two sets

518
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,297
of those new duridium-alloy
darts I told you about.

519
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:36,590
They should be
here next week.

520
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,217
Darts?

521
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,344
We're facing a major
interstellar war,

522
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,388
and you're thinking about darts?

523
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:44,348
Well, life must go on.

524
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:46,225
Besides, I have a feeling

525
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:49,228
things are going to turn out
for the best.

526
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,188
I hope you're right.

527
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,698
Your asparagus
with<i> yamok</i> sauce.

528
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:04,535
The last of my fresh
asparagus, I might add.

529
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:06,995
Not that I'll need
to stock it anymore.

530
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,873
Somehow I get the feeling
there won't be much
demand for human food

531
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,334
once the Jem'Hadar have
finished with this place.

532
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,628
Aren't you being
a little pessimistic?

533
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:16,088
Am I?

534
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,591
The Jem'Hadar don't
eat, don't drink,

535
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:20,175
and they don't have sex,

536
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,844
and if that wasn't bad
enough, the Founders

537
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,346
don't eat and don't drink,

538
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,139
and they don't
have sex either.

539
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,933
Which, between you and me,

540
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:31,311
makes my financial future
less than promising.

541
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:34,231
It might not be so bad.

542
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:36,024
For all we know

543
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:39,027
the Vorta could be gluttonous,
alcoholic sex maniacs.

544
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,488
I never thought of that.

545
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:45,117
I wonder what their
favorite food is.

546
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:48,870
Good news.

547
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,248
The Starfleet task force
under Admiral Gilhouly

548
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:52,791
has entered Bajoran space.

549
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,960
Hope they know
what they're in for.

550
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:03,302
First, they demand
we come out here.

551
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:04,844
Then they make us wait.

552
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,388
They are worthy fighters,

553
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:09,015
but they have
no sense of honor.

554
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,480
Is there no Jem'Hadar
willing to face me?

555
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,775
Fascinating.
Even after all
he's been through,

556
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:19,901
the Klingon still
thirsts for battle.

557
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,528
Doesn't he ever
tire of it?

558
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,738
I never do.

559
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,114
You fight because that

560
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:25,907
is what you were
designed to do.

561
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,326
All that motivates him

562
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,244
is some barbaric
sense of honor.

563
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,289
And that is something
you will never understand.

564
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,457
Prepare yourself.

565
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,751
I've found you
a worthy opponent.

566
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,252
Where is he?

567
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,713
Right in front of you.

568
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,134
Victory is life.

569
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:47,721
Today<i> is</i> a good day to die.

570
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,229
(<i> grunts</i> )

571
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:03,236
Tain, I don't know
if you can hear me.

572
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:06,490
But if you can,
I just want you to know

573
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,909
you may not have been
much of a father,

574
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:13,706
but I<i> really</i> wish
you were alive right now.

575
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:17,626
That way, you could be in here
instead of me.

576
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,253
(<i> grunts</i> )

577
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:33,851
Jem'Hadar.

578
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:35,977
Can we get him out?

579
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,522
No time.

580
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:48,782
The Cardassian--
where is he?

581
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,409
Outside...

582
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:51,951
I suppose.

583
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,707
He is<i> not</i> outside.

584
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,419
Move.

585
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:07,092
What do you want with him?

586
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:10,303
JEM'HADAR:
He is to be
put to death.

587
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,764
Sir!

588
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:24,610
If<i> you</i> wish to live,

589
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,487
explain this.

590
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,578
The Bird-of-Prey<i> Y'tem</i>
is in position.

591
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,079
That's everybody.

592
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,372
Major. Commander.

593
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,874
Report to the<i> Defiant.</i>

594
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,250
Yes, sir.

595
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,377
Good luck.

596
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,421
To all of us.

597
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,806
Deploy the runabouts.

598
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,323
O'BRIEN:
Runabout<i> Yukon,</i>
prepare for departure.

599
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:14,576
Runabouts<i> Rio Grande</i>
and<i> Volga,</i> stand by.

600
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,578
FEMALE VOICE:
<i>Yukon</i> ready.

601
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,581
Engines engaged.

602
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,416
O'BRIEN:
Good luck,<i> Yukon.</i>

603
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:35,305
Sir, I'm picking up
a large tachyon buildup.

604
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,390
Multiple vectors.

605
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,518
Ships de-cloaking.

606
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:54,700
Romulans.

607
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,369
They're requesting permission
to join the fleet.

608
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:58,704
I'll be damned.

609
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,038
Permission granted.

610
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,289
KIRA:
<i>Defiant</i> to Ops.

611
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,082
Go ahead, Major.

612
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:07,045
Sensors have just detected
Dominion and Cardassian ships

613
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,797
entering Bajoran space.

614
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,256
ETA ten minutes.

615
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:20,099
I'll ask you for the last
time-- what is this?

616
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:23,269
It's either
a self-sealing stem bolt

617
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,146
or a reverse-ratchetting
router.

618
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,858
I'm just not sure.

619
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,072
She is next.

620
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,782
JEM'HADAR:
Sir!

621
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:38,577
If you'll allow me...?

622
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,516
(<i> grunts</i> )

623
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,272
Worf...

624
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:10,358
honor has been satisfied.

625
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,735
Stay down.

626
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,792
Finish this.

627
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,543
(<i> grunts</i> )

628
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,381
(<i> grunts</i> )

629
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,189
What do you see?

630
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,276
I see nothing.

631
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,778
It's dark.

632
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:14,798
My people have a saying:

633
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:17,550
Never turn your back
on a Breen.

634
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,970
Doctor, would you keep
the noise down?

635
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,805
I'm trying to work in here.

636
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:24,099
Garak, how many transtator
circuits have you got left?

637
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,476
Three.
Well, work fast,
because pretty soon

638
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:28,436
we're going to be up
to our necks in Jem'Hadar.

639
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,480
(<i> grunting</i> )

640
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:47,330
Enough, Klingon.

641
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,041
You have proven
your worth.

642
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:51,334
Worf...
you heard him.

643
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,585
Enough.

644
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,546
I will not yield!

645
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:58,466
What are you waiting for?
End this.

646
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,677
It's over.

647
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,345
It is<i> not</i> over.

648
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,056
You heard him.

649
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,602
(<i> gasps</i> )

650
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,527
I yield.

651
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:19,487
You<i> what?</i>

652
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,864
I yield!

653
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:23,950
I cannot defeat
this Klingon.

654
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,036
All I can do is kill him,

655
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:29,789
and that no longer
holds my interest.

656
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,419
Shoot them both.

657
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,756
Got it!

658
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,062
BASHIR:
Take him to one of
the cabins in the back.

659
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:54,231
I'll be with you
as soon as I can.

660
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,317
Garak.

661
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:02,488
You did well.

662
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,490
So did you.

663
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,328
BASHIR:
Take us
to maximum warp, Garak.

664
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,706
We've got to get
a message to the station.

665
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,797
The Dominion fleet
should be in visual range.

666
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,590
On screen.

667
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,635
Where are they?

668
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,095
According
to their warp signatures,

669
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:26,471
they should be right there.

670
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,306
Some kind of cloaking device?

671
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,308
I didn't know
the Dominion had them.

672
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,936
Or the Cardassians,
for that matter.

673
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:36,773
I'm picking up
additional warp signatures

674
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:41,903
bearing 183 mark 97.

675
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,948
244 mark 12.

676
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:48,868
302 mark 133.

678
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:51,370
Go ahead.

679
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,372
According
to our sensor readings,

680
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:55,167
there are Dominion ships
all around us,

681
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,543
but we can't see them or get
any kind of targeting lock.

682
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,754
We're reading the same thing.

683
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,756
They're everywhere.

684
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,133
What are your orders, Captain?

685
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:04,968
Chief!
I need targets!

686
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:07,095
I'm trying,
but I can't get anything.

687
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,264
We may have to wait for them
to open fire and then--

688
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:10,849
(<i> console beeping</i> )

689
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,685
Captain, I'm picking up
a priority one message

690
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,145
from the Gamma Quadrant.

691
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:17,022
It's Dr. Bashir!

692
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:20,275
Bashir?
Computer, locate Dr. Bashir.

693
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:23,153
Dr. Bashir is not
on the station.

694
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:25,905
What was
his last known location?

695
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:30,702
Dr. Bashir's last known location
was Runabout Pad E.

696
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:33,163
Sisko to<i> Defiant.</i>

697
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:35,332
Go ahead.
Major, you have new orders.

698
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:37,375
I want you to find
the<i> Yukon</i> and destroy it

699
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,294
at any cost.
Is that clear?

700
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:42,463
Yes, sir.
Commander.

701
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,717
The<i> Yukon</i> is headed straight
for the Bajoran sun.

702
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,606
Its shields are holding.

703
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,525
How can<i> that</i> be?

704
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:05,695
Looks like someone's been doing
some modifications to the<i> Yukon.</i>

705
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:08,073
I'm also picking up
large amounts of trilithium,

706
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:10,325
tekasite and protomatter
on board.

707
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:11,617
A bomb.

708
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,286
If it explodes
inside the sun...

709
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:15,330
It could trigger
a supernova--

710
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,832
wipe out the entire
fleet, the station...

711
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,125
And Bajor.

712
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,459
We have to use
the tractor beams.

713
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,003
We're too far away.

714
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,504
Want to bet?
Take us to warp.

715
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,257
Inside a solar system?!

716
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:28,301
If we don't, there won't
be a solar system left.

717
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,978
(<i> ticking beeps</i> )

718
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:49,406
The runabout's been destroyed.

719
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:52,367
If the sun had gone nova,

720
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:55,078
it would have wiped out
the Dominion fleet, too.

721
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:58,206
Chief, scan for
those warp signatures again.

722
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,167
Captain...

723
00:41:02,419 --> 00:41:04,296
They're gone, aren't they?

724
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:05,671
All I'm reading is

725
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,048
normal background radiation.

726
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:10,676
The warp signatures
must have been faked.

727
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:13,972
The Dominion's real fleet
never left Cardassian space.

728
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:17,475
This was all an elaborate trap--

729
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,270
an attempt to destroy
the station and Bajor,

730
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:23,148
and cripple the Federation
and Klingon fleets,

731
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:26,651
without ever firing a shot.

732
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:29,862
Tell our friends out there
to stand down.

733
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:34,451
Armageddon will have to wait
for another day.

734
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:40,623
Ziyal?

735
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,502
I told you I'd be back.

736
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,545
(<i> gasps</i> )

737
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:51,384
I never doubted it.

738
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:57,723
O'BRIEN:
Four weeks?

739
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,351
Are you telling me
I've been hanging around

740
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:01,311
with a changeling
for over a month?

741
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:04,439
And you never even suspected
it wasn't me?

742
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:06,191
No, and the worst part is,

743
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:08,818
the clues were right
in front of me.

744
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:10,028
What clues?

745
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,363
Well, for one thing,

746
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:14,032
he was a lot easier
to get along with.

747
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,658
(<i> sighs</i> )

748
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,455
So, I suppose
this means you want

749
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:23,416
your Klingon opera
collection back.

750
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:24,792
Intact.

751
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,295
More or less.

752
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,053
GOWRON:
Then it's settled.

753
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:36,721
In light of the new treaty,

754
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:39,015
and the continued
Dominion threat

755
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:40,766
to the Alpha Quadrant

756
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:43,811
there will be a permanent
Klingon military presence

757
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,813
on this station.

758
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,733
But I choose the Commander.

759
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,109
Agreed.

760
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,450
Mr. Worf thinks very highly
of you, General.

761
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:01,913
I think very highly of him.

762
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:05,250
Then I can't think
of a better man for the job,

763
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,919
if you'll take it.

764
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:12,340
I would be honored.

765
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,008
KIRA:
Ops to Sisko.

766
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,385
Sisko here.

767
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:17,345
You're receiving
an incoming message.

768
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,431
It's from Dukat.

769
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:23,017
Well, Captain,
I must congratulate you.

770
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:27,313
If that protomatter device
had gone off inside the sun...

771
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:30,733
Well... the death toll
would have been enormous.

772
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,026
And your daughter

773
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,404
would have been
one of the casualties.

774
00:43:34,404 --> 00:43:37,532
Ziyal made her choice.

775
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:41,744
As far as I'm concerned,
she's no longer my daughter.

776
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:44,080
You know, Dukat,
I thought you'd changed

777
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,457
in the last five years.

778
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:46,791
I see I was wrong.

779
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,251
One man's villain

780
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:51,588
is another man's hero, Captain.

781
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:54,257
You should see the monument
they're erecting in my honor

782
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:56,050
at the gateway
to the Imperial Plaza.

783
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,970
Is that why you sold out
your people to the Dominion?

784
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,597
For a monument?!

785
00:44:00,597 --> 00:44:03,099
What I did...

786
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:07,270
I did to make Cardassia
strong again.

787
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:11,149
And mark my words, Captain,
I succeeded.

788
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:15,194
You<i> may</i> have escaped defeat
this day,

789
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,737
but tomorrow--

790
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,739
We will see about tomorrow.

791
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,825
Yes, we will.
