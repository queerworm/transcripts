00:00:02,564 --> 00:00:04,660
Last time on
<i>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...</i>

2
00:00:04,702 --> 00:00:07,173
One of our listening posts
in the Gamma Quadrant

3
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:08,677
picked this up
a few minutes ago.

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,646
It looks like
a Cardassian military code

5
00:00:10,682 --> 00:00:12,515
but the computer
doesn't recognize it.

6
00:00:12,552 --> 00:00:14,021
It was a call for help...

7
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:15,285
from Enabran Tain.

8
00:00:16,395 --> 00:00:17,694
We must warn the station.

9
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,700
There is only one reason
for the Dominion

10
00:00:19,735 --> 00:00:21,671
to hide such a large fleet
this close to the wormhole.

11
00:00:21,706 --> 00:00:23,676
You think they're planning
to attack the Alpha Quadrant?

12
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,204
There's no way
we can beat the Dominion.

13
00:00:26,249 --> 00:00:28,345
Our only hope is
to prevent their fleet

14
00:00:28,387 --> 00:00:30,152
from entering
the Alpha Quadrant.

15
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:31,990
You're going to destroy
the wormhole?

16
00:00:32,028 --> 00:00:33,827
You have to trust me.

17
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:36,770
Things are going to change
on Cardassia.

18
00:00:36,806 --> 00:00:38,571
- What things?
- I don't have

19
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:39,577
time to explain.

20
00:00:39,611 --> 00:00:40,910
You're leaving now.

21
00:00:40,948 --> 00:00:41,916
I can't go.

22
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:42,940
It's him, isn't it?!

23
00:00:42,986 --> 00:00:44,580
That despicable tailor.

24
00:00:44,622 --> 00:00:47,025
You don't want to leave
because you're waiting for him?

25
00:00:47,061 --> 00:00:49,760
This is Internment Camp 371.

26
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:53,799
You are here because you
are enemies of the Dominion.

27
00:00:53,844 --> 00:00:55,370
You're not my son.

28
00:00:55,413 --> 00:00:57,440
Father, you're dying.

29
00:00:57,485 --> 00:01:01,392
For once in your life,
speak the truth.

30
00:01:05,703 --> 00:01:07,138
General Martok.

31
00:01:07,173 --> 00:01:09,406
The changeling that replaced me

32
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:12,474
has caused the death
of countless Klingons.

33
00:01:12,518 --> 00:01:14,181
It is a grave dishonor.

34
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:16,088
I can only imagine
what my replacement

35
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,354
is up to on the station.

36
00:01:23,675 --> 00:01:24,370
We're losing it.

37
00:01:27,183 --> 00:01:28,048
What happened?

38
00:01:28,085 --> 00:01:29,679
Someone sabotaged
the emitter array.

39
00:01:33,564 --> 00:01:34,691
Battle stations!

40
00:01:35,936 --> 00:01:38,100
And now the conclusion.

41
00:01:49,198 --> 00:01:51,065
Release docking clamps.

42
00:01:52,204 --> 00:01:53,673
Clamps released.

43
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:54,676
Shields up.

44
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,441
Power to phasers
and quantum torpedoes.

45
00:01:56,481 --> 00:01:58,041
Weapons ready.

46
00:01:58,085 --> 00:01:59,952
Bring us around.

47
00:02:07,505 --> 00:02:09,908
Dukat's bird-of-prey
is in position.

48
00:02:09,944 --> 00:02:11,914
Maintain communications
blackout.

49
00:02:11,948 --> 00:02:15,444
Nobody fires until we have
our orders from Captain Sisko.

50
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:17,322
There sure are a lot of them.

51
00:02:17,427 --> 00:02:20,263
That'll just make it
harder for us to miss.

52
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,999
They're still not
responding to our hails.

53
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:25,340
I think they're trying
to intimidate us.

54
00:02:25,377 --> 00:02:27,370
It's working.

55
00:02:30,388 --> 00:02:31,687
I don't believe it.

56
00:02:31,725 --> 00:02:34,526
The Dominion ships are
turning away from the station.

57
00:02:34,564 --> 00:02:35,589
They're laying in a new course.

58
00:02:35,634 --> 00:02:36,624
Heading?

59
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:39,197
Straight for Cardassia.

60
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,483
Dukat's ship
is breaking formation.

61
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:47,822
He's going after
the Dominion fleet.

62
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,850
Open a channel.

63
00:02:49,731 --> 00:02:51,598
Dukat, stop trying
to be a hero.

64
00:02:51,636 --> 00:02:52,900
Get back to the station.

65
00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:55,136
Your concern is touching, Major.

66
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:57,374
But I think you
misunderstand me.

67
00:02:57,415 --> 00:03:00,046
I'm not attacking
the Dominion fleet.

68
00:03:00,087 --> 00:03:02,354
I'm joining it.

69
00:03:02,393 --> 00:03:03,987
What are you talking about?

70
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,026
I'm afraid I have a confession
to make, Major.

71
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:08,629
For the past few months

72
00:03:08,673 --> 00:03:11,372
I've been conducting
secret negotiations

73
00:03:11,412 --> 00:03:13,781
between the Dominion
and Cardassia.

74
00:03:13,817 --> 00:03:16,721
And as of last week,
Cardassia has agreed

75
00:03:16,757 --> 00:03:19,058
to become part of the Dominion.

76
00:03:19,096 --> 00:03:20,895
You can't be serious.

77
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:22,402
Good-bye, Major.

78
00:03:22,437 --> 00:03:25,410
You and I on the same side...

79
00:03:25,443 --> 00:03:27,914
it never seemed quite...

80
00:03:27,948 --> 00:03:31,080
right... did it?

81
00:03:32,024 --> 00:03:33,721
Lock phasers.
Open fire.

82
00:03:35,064 --> 00:03:35,854
Too late.
He's gone.

83
00:05:46,377 --> 00:05:47,937
All clear.

84
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,680
The transmitter Tain used
to contact the station

85
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,915
where is it?

86
00:06:17,713 --> 00:06:19,182
You have to crawl
through that hole

87
00:06:19,217 --> 00:06:21,153
and kind of slide your way
up into the wall.

88
00:06:21,187 --> 00:06:22,155
It took him over a year

89
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:23,852
to modify the old
life-support system

90
00:06:23,893 --> 00:06:24,861
into a transmitter.

91
00:06:24,895 --> 00:06:26,090
How did he operate it?

92
00:06:26,132 --> 00:06:27,100
He wired the message

93
00:06:27,134 --> 00:06:28,329
and the transmission
coordinates

94
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:29,702
directly into
the system's circuitry.

95
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,243
That way, all he had to do
was connect the transmitter

96
00:06:32,278 --> 00:06:34,009
to the power grid
and let it run.

97
00:06:34,048 --> 00:06:35,915
Could the coordinates
and the message be changed?

98
00:06:35,953 --> 00:06:38,686
You're planning
to contact the runabout.

99
00:06:38,726 --> 00:06:40,286
We could activate
the transporter

100
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:41,923
and beam ourselves
onto the ship.

101
00:06:41,966 --> 00:06:43,195
And run like hell.

102
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:45,706
Re-encoding
the transmitter won't be easy.

103
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:47,267
We'd have to reconfigure
the array

104
00:06:47,311 --> 00:06:49,042
one circuit at a time.

105
00:06:49,081 --> 00:06:50,208
Can you do it?

106
00:06:50,251 --> 00:06:51,082
Me?

107
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,088
I'm no engineer.

108
00:06:52,122 --> 00:06:53,751
Neither is Mr. Worf here.

109
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:55,956
You, on the other hand,
my dear Mr. Garak

110
00:06:55,997 --> 00:06:57,466
are a man
of many hidden talents.

111
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,764
- Hmm.
- If you can't do it

112
00:06:58,803 --> 00:07:00,067
nobody can.

113
00:07:00,106 --> 00:07:01,700
It's nice to feel needed.

114
00:07:01,777 --> 00:07:04,078
All prisoners
assemble immediately.

115
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:05,583
I repeat:

116
00:07:05,618 --> 00:07:08,181
All prisoners
assemble immediately.

117
00:07:13,803 --> 00:07:14,828
Who is that?

118
00:07:14,871 --> 00:07:17,035
Deyos. The Vorta
that runs this camp.

119
00:07:17,077 --> 00:07:19,013
No talking.

120
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:20,311
Touchy, aren't they?

121
00:07:20,351 --> 00:07:23,381
All Cardassian prisoners
step forward.

122
00:07:33,212 --> 00:07:34,598
I am pleased to announce

123
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:37,066
that hostilities between
our peoples have ended.

124
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:40,634
As of today, Cardassia
has joined the Dominion.

125
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:43,149
Therefore, you're all
being sent home.

126
00:07:43,183 --> 00:07:46,486
Congratulations on your new
status as Dominion citizens.

127
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:54,868
Not you, Mr. Garak.

128
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:55,877
Excuse me?

129
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:57,038
You're staying.

130
00:07:57,081 --> 00:08:00,077
Well, there must be
some misunderstanding.

131
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,321
The last time I checked,
I was a Cardassian.

132
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,353
But not a very popular one,
I'm afraid.

133
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:06,867
At least not with the head

134
00:08:06,902 --> 00:08:08,667
of the new Cardassian
government.

135
00:08:08,706 --> 00:08:10,369
And who would that be?

136
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,471
Gul Dukat.

137
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:18,017
You might ask, should we fear
joining the Dominion?

138
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,967
And I answer you,
not in the least.

139
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:25,601
We should embrace
the opportunity.

140
00:08:25,643 --> 00:08:29,208
The Dominion recognizes us
for what we are...

141
00:08:29,251 --> 00:08:32,315
the true leaders
of the Alpha Quadrant.

142
00:08:32,358 --> 00:08:34,989
And now that we are
joined together

143
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,399
equal partners in all endeavors

144
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:41,399
the only people with anything
to fear will be our enemies.

145
00:08:41,444 --> 00:08:45,179
My oldest son's birthday
is in five days.

146
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,751
To him and to Cardassians
everywhere

147
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,627
I make the following pledge:

148
00:08:50,665 --> 00:08:53,797
By the time his birthday dawns

149
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,835
there will not be
a single Klingon alive

150
00:08:56,878 --> 00:08:59,611
inside Cardassian territory

151
00:08:59,651 --> 00:09:04,287
or a single Maquis colony
left within our borders.

152
00:09:04,328 --> 00:09:07,426
Cardassia will be made whole.

153
00:09:07,468 --> 00:09:11,307
All that we have lost
will be ours again.

154
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:17,415
And anyone who stands in our way
will be destroyed.

155
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:21,421
This I vow with my life's blood.

156
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:24,439
For my son...

157
00:09:24,473 --> 00:09:28,437
for all our sons.

158
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:30,645
Somebody tell me
this is a bad dream.

159
00:09:30,686 --> 00:09:32,622
It's no dream.

160
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:35,128
Well, I've got a vow
to make, too.

161
00:09:35,162 --> 00:09:38,363
Next time I see Dukat,
I'm going to kill him.

162
00:09:38,403 --> 00:09:41,068
Right now, we have
a more immediate concern

163
00:09:41,108 --> 00:09:43,909
such as... who sabotaged
our graviton emitters?

164
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:45,213
I don't know who it was

165
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,118
but they did a pretty
thorough job.

166
00:09:47,156 --> 00:09:49,457
The emitters had the
exact opposite effect

167
00:09:49,494 --> 00:09:50,689
of what we'd intended.

168
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,393
They were supposed
to collapse

169
00:09:52,434 --> 00:09:55,338
the wormhole's spatial matrix
and close it forever.

170
00:09:55,374 --> 00:09:57,868
Instead, they made the matrix
even more stable.

171
00:09:57,913 --> 00:10:00,282
Not even trilithium explosives
could destroy it now.

172
00:10:00,318 --> 00:10:02,049
So the Dominion
can send reinforcements

173
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:03,888
through the wormhole
whenever they want.

174
00:10:03,926 --> 00:10:04,951
Looks like it's time

175
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:06,760
for another round
of blood screenings.

176
00:10:06,798 --> 00:10:08,097
Obviously, we have

177
00:10:08,135 --> 00:10:10,231
a changeling infiltrator
on the station.

178
00:10:10,272 --> 00:10:12,242
What makes you think
it's a changeling?

179
00:10:12,277 --> 00:10:13,974
That's who I'd send.

180
00:10:15,017 --> 00:10:16,577
I think Julian's right.

181
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,421
Odo tells me that a Bajoran
maintenance engineer

182
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:20,427
has been missing

183
00:10:20,462 --> 00:10:21,589
ever since the Dominion fleet

184
00:10:21,698 --> 00:10:22,962
arrived in the Alpha Quadrant.

185
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:24,766
And if that was our changeling

186
00:10:24,805 --> 00:10:28,108
he's either gone
or assumed a new identity.

187
00:10:28,146 --> 00:10:29,979
We can't afford
to take any chances.

188
00:10:30,016 --> 00:10:32,419
I want blood screenings
and phaser sweeps.

189
00:10:32,455 --> 00:10:33,445
If he's out there

190
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:34,651
we've got to find him.

191
00:10:42,844 --> 00:10:44,643
He's taking too much time.

192
00:10:44,682 --> 00:10:45,809
How long has he been in there?

193
00:10:45,851 --> 00:10:47,012
Close to an hour.

194
00:10:47,054 --> 00:10:49,218
Garak, how's it coming along?

195
00:10:49,258 --> 00:10:52,754
I only wish I were still
a member of the Obsidian Order.

196
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,466
This would make a wonderful
interrogation chamber.

197
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,574
Tight quarters.

198
00:11:00,617 --> 00:11:03,384
No air, bad lighting,
random electric shocks.

199
00:11:03,423 --> 00:11:04,915
It's perfect.

200
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,625
Sounds like you're
enjoying yourself.

201
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:10,638
If you'd like, I'd happily
trade places with you.

202
00:11:10,672 --> 00:11:11,765
I suppose you could

203
00:11:11,808 --> 00:11:13,972
give me a crash course
in Cardassian field engineering.

204
00:11:14,013 --> 00:11:15,949
I should be ready to take over
from you in what?

205
00:11:15,984 --> 00:11:16,952
Five or six weeks?

206
00:11:16,986 --> 00:11:17,646
Visitors.

207
00:11:17,754 --> 00:11:19,348
Quiet.

208
00:11:42,442 --> 00:11:43,809
It's time.

209
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,285
I am ready.

210
00:11:49,324 --> 00:11:52,729
I've been looking forward
to this.

211
00:11:52,798 --> 00:11:54,962
So have I.

212
00:12:12,742 --> 00:12:14,872
Give me a hand.

213
00:12:16,182 --> 00:12:17,674
Hold on, Garak.

214
00:12:18,688 --> 00:12:21,182
Wait. The guards are
still too close.

215
00:12:28,878 --> 00:12:31,042
Just a little while longer,
Garak.

216
00:12:34,924 --> 00:12:37,088
I thought I would
be fighting lkat'ika.

217
00:12:37,128 --> 00:12:40,192
I would not be so eager
if I were you.

218
00:12:40,235 --> 00:12:42,706
This is his handiwork.

219
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:45,714
He has much to answer for.

220
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:47,547
His time will come.

221
00:12:47,585 --> 00:12:49,054
Now, remember

222
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:50,888
every time you hit the ground

223
00:12:50,926 --> 00:12:52,896
you must touch
one of these posts

224
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,163
or else you
forfeit the match.

225
00:12:55,202 --> 00:12:59,166
Today, we train
against a worthy adversary.

226
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:03,175
Observe, analyze, remember.

227
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,753
Soon we will face his people
in combat.

228
00:13:07,796 --> 00:13:11,760
The lessons you learn here
will ensure victory.

229
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:15,073
- Victory is life!
- Victory is life!

230
00:13:18,086 --> 00:13:19,578
Begin!

231
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:57,627
Oh... come on.

232
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,705
Clear.

233
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:20,354
Oh! That was
thoroughly unpleasant.

234
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:21,516
Are you all right?

235
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,527
I am fine.

236
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,862
It's just much hotter
in there than I thought.

237
00:14:24,966 --> 00:14:26,401
I got a little light-headed.

238
00:14:26,435 --> 00:14:27,870
Give me a minute
and I'll go back in there.

239
00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:28,998
No, you need more
than a minute.

240
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:30,101
Your pulse is racing.

241
00:14:30,144 --> 00:14:31,738
I don't want to think
about your blood pressure.

242
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:33,010
Maybe you should wait
until tomorrow.

243
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,018
Do you want to get

244
00:14:34,053 --> 00:14:35,886
- off this hellhole?
- You know I do.

245
00:14:35,923 --> 00:14:37,517
Then let me get back to work.

246
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,895
Rest.

247
00:14:39,932 --> 00:14:41,663
For five minutes,
and from here on in

248
00:14:41,703 --> 00:14:43,730
you can take a 15-minute
break every hour.

249
00:14:43,773 --> 00:14:45,640
Doctor's orders.

250
00:15:05,054 --> 00:15:08,186
Was that the best
you have to offer?

251
00:15:08,228 --> 00:15:11,827
He was our youngest
and least experienced.

252
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,340
I promise your next opponent

253
00:15:14,374 --> 00:15:16,868
will provide
more of a challenge.

254
00:15:28,973 --> 00:15:31,969
View's even better
from Upper Pylon 2.

255
00:15:33,984 --> 00:15:37,446
I keep hoping
that the wormhole will open.

256
00:15:37,493 --> 00:15:39,463
That Garak's runabout
will come through

257
00:15:39,497 --> 00:15:42,470
and everything
will be all right again.

258
00:15:42,504 --> 00:15:44,167
Maybe it will.

259
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,845
My father says Garak's dead.

260
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,820
Right now, I wouldn't
believe your father

261
00:15:51,858 --> 00:15:54,022
if he said rain was wet.

262
00:15:56,802 --> 00:16:01,107
I used to think
my father was a hero.

263
00:16:01,144 --> 00:16:03,775
That even when he
did something bad

264
00:16:03,817 --> 00:16:05,650
he had a good reason.

265
00:16:05,687 --> 00:16:07,156
Everyone has their reasons.

266
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:09,127
That's what's so frightening.

267
00:16:09,162 --> 00:16:12,465
People can find a way
to justify any action

268
00:16:12,503 --> 00:16:14,063
no matter how evil.

269
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,340
You think my father is evil?

270
00:16:16,378 --> 00:16:18,474
I think...

271
00:16:18,516 --> 00:16:21,648
you can't judge people
by what they think...

272
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,660
or say...

273
00:16:23,694 --> 00:16:25,790
only by what they do.

274
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,476
Captain's Log, Stardate 50564.2.

275
00:16:34,518 --> 00:16:36,454
A large contingent
of Klingon warships

276
00:16:36,488 --> 00:16:38,584
has arrived
from Cardassian space

277
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,254
but its intentions

278
00:16:40,297 --> 00:16:42,825
at least for the moment,
remain unclear.

279
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:43,962
We're being hailed.

280
00:16:44,005 --> 00:16:46,032
It's Chancellor Gowron.

281
00:16:46,077 --> 00:16:48,207
He's requesting
permission to dock.

282
00:16:48,247 --> 00:16:49,876
They've got wounded.

283
00:16:49,918 --> 00:16:51,547
Permission granted.

284
00:16:51,588 --> 00:16:53,057
I have the feeling

285
00:16:53,092 --> 00:16:55,495
the Klingons' war
against the Cardassians

286
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,195
has taken a turn for the worse.

287
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,178
This is a dark day.

288
00:17:02,212 --> 00:17:04,513
Not only for the Klingon Empire

289
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,785
but for the Alpha Quadrant
itself.

290
00:17:07,824 --> 00:17:10,022
So what are we going
to do about it?

291
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:12,033
I will do what must be done.

292
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:14,368
Fall back, pull my forces
out of Cardassian space

293
00:17:14,406 --> 00:17:15,875
fortify the Klingon Empire

294
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,540
and prepare
for a fight to the death.

295
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:20,551
Maybe there's a better way.

296
00:17:20,585 --> 00:17:22,555
The Khitomer Accords?

297
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:25,563
The treaty
between the Federation

298
00:17:25,596 --> 00:17:27,931
and the Klingon Empire
is dead.

299
00:17:29,605 --> 00:17:32,578
But we can bring it
back to life again.

300
00:17:32,612 --> 00:17:34,582
This is the most
fortified position

301
00:17:34,616 --> 00:17:36,586
between here
and the Klingon Empire.

302
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,251
There will be a Starfleet
task force here soon.

303
00:17:39,294 --> 00:17:41,264
If you could
bring your fleet here...

304
00:17:41,298 --> 00:17:44,099
Then we could stand united
against the Dominion.

305
00:17:44,137 --> 00:17:46,665
And if we do...

306
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,808
We might have a chance.

307
00:18:00,941 --> 00:18:02,570
Think of it.

308
00:18:02,612 --> 00:18:05,083
Five years ago,
no one had ever heard

309
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,087
of Bajor or Deep Space 9

310
00:18:07,121 --> 00:18:11,620
and now,
all our hopes rest here.

311
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,901
Where the tides
of fortune take us

312
00:18:15,941 --> 00:18:17,774
no man can know.

313
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,480
They're tricky, those tides.

314
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,335
Five matches...

315
00:19:31,373 --> 00:19:33,434
and five victories.

316
00:19:33,477 --> 00:19:39,445
You truly have the spirit
of Kahless within you.

317
00:19:39,491 --> 00:19:41,484
Until tomorrow.

318
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:46,130
I'll be waiting!

319
00:19:46,172 --> 00:19:48,643
You've got
three broken ribs...

320
00:19:48,678 --> 00:19:49,977
maybe four.

321
00:19:50,013 --> 00:19:51,676
They will heal.

322
00:19:51,717 --> 00:19:53,710
Not if you keep fighting,
they won't.

323
00:19:53,756 --> 00:19:55,989
You're lucky you didn't
puncture a lung.

324
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:57,496
A body... even a Klingon body...

325
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,363
can only take
so much punishment.

326
00:19:59,402 --> 00:20:00,701
I will fight.

327
00:20:00,737 --> 00:20:03,038
It is the only
honorable thing to do.

328
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,841
He'll lose,
and in this condition

329
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,848
he might even die.

330
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:07,851
Then I will die.

331
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,856
But I will not yield.

332
00:20:09,924 --> 00:20:11,791
You heard him.

333
00:20:11,828 --> 00:20:13,730
Bandage his ribs!

334
00:20:20,146 --> 00:20:23,381
I'm sorry, but that's
absolutely unacceptable.

335
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,083
I'm under enough strain
as it is.

336
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:26,821
I can't have you quitting on me.

337
00:20:26,861 --> 00:20:29,332
Get ahold of yourself, Garak.

338
00:20:29,366 --> 00:20:32,396
After all, you haven't had
one of these attacks in years.

339
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,809
Yes, this is
a tight, enclosed space.

340
00:20:34,846 --> 00:20:37,340
Yes, there's not a lot
of room to move.

341
00:20:37,384 --> 00:20:41,017
But a disciplined mind does not
allow itself to be sidetracked

342
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:44,362
by niggling psychological
disorders like...

343
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:46,335
claustrophobia.

344
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:50,437
Besides, this isn't
like Tzenketh.

345
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,281
The walls won't
collapse in on you.

346
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,948
Your friends are nearby.

347
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,185
There's plenty of air.

348
00:20:56,226 --> 00:20:59,631
So there's nothing
to be concerned about.

349
00:21:02,774 --> 00:21:05,143
Focus on the job.

350
00:21:05,178 --> 00:21:08,048
You're the only person
who can contact the runabout.

351
00:21:08,085 --> 00:21:09,714
People are depending on you.

352
00:21:09,756 --> 00:21:12,729
Ziyal is depending on you.

353
00:21:12,762 --> 00:21:15,735
You promised her you'd come back

354
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:20,336
and that young lady has had
quite enough disappointments

355
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,440
in her life without you
adding to them.

356
00:21:22,483 --> 00:21:24,647
So...

357
00:21:24,689 --> 00:21:26,750
control yourself.

358
00:21:26,793 --> 00:21:30,791
You're stronger than this.

359
00:21:30,835 --> 00:21:33,500
A disciplined mind...

360
00:21:35,244 --> 00:21:37,579
I'm afraid
that's the best I can do.

361
00:21:37,617 --> 00:21:38,984
Does it feel any better?

362
00:21:39,053 --> 00:21:40,682
Much better.

363
00:21:40,724 --> 00:21:42,523
You're not a very good liar,
Mr. Worf.

364
00:21:44,766 --> 00:21:46,395
What was that?

365
00:21:46,436 --> 00:21:48,839
It's coming
from inside the wall.

366
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:49,843
Garak.

367
00:21:49,877 --> 00:21:51,004
How long has he been in there?

368
00:21:51,113 --> 00:21:52,103
About half an hour.

369
00:21:58,195 --> 00:22:00,530
Garak, Garak, what is it?

370
00:22:04,643 --> 00:22:07,171
Tell him to stop
before they hear him.

371
00:22:07,215 --> 00:22:09,345
Garak, the panel's open now.

372
00:22:09,386 --> 00:22:10,855
You can come out.

373
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:13,555
We've got to get him
out of there.

374
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,804
Garak.

375
00:22:22,449 --> 00:22:24,112
Garak.

376
00:22:28,161 --> 00:22:29,960
Garak, you have to stop.

377
00:22:29,998 --> 00:22:32,025
You're making too much noise.

378
00:22:32,104 --> 00:22:33,573
Garak!

379
00:22:33,606 --> 00:22:34,905
The light...

380
00:22:34,943 --> 00:22:36,913
the light went out.

381
00:22:36,947 --> 00:22:38,211
I know.

382
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,549
Come on.

383
00:22:39,587 --> 00:22:40,886
I think you can

384
00:22:40,922 --> 00:22:43,086
take your break a little early.

385
00:22:50,376 --> 00:22:51,709
It would appear that he suffers

386
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,306
from an acute form
of claustrophobia.

387
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,446
It's a wonder that he lasted
as long as he did.

388
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,082
Then one of us
will have to finish

389
00:22:57,159 --> 00:22:58,594
reconfiguring
the transmitter.

390
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:01,726
And who would you suggest
could do that?

391
00:23:01,768 --> 00:23:03,738
Exactly.

392
00:23:03,773 --> 00:23:06,210
If Garak can't
contact the runabout

393
00:23:06,244 --> 00:23:08,807
we're not going anywhere.

394
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:18,982
The last of Gowron's ships
have arrived.

395
00:23:19,115 --> 00:23:21,746
I'll have a repair crew
get to work on them right away.

396
00:23:21,821 --> 00:23:22,982
Any word from Starfleet?

397
00:23:23,024 --> 00:23:24,516
Admiral Gilhouly's task force

398
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,462
is less
than four light years away.

399
00:23:26,498 --> 00:23:28,992
I'll feel a lot better
when they get here.

400
00:23:29,037 --> 00:23:30,404
You're not the only one.

401
00:23:30,441 --> 00:23:31,409
Captain.

402
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:32,411
Yes, Major.

403
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:34,643
I just spoke with Odo.

404
00:23:34,683 --> 00:23:36,744
Someone overrode
the security blocks

405
00:23:36,787 --> 00:23:39,190
on the industrial replicator
on Level 17.

406
00:23:39,226 --> 00:23:40,387
Sounds like our saboteur.

407
00:23:40,428 --> 00:23:41,396
Did they catch him?

408
00:23:41,431 --> 00:23:42,456
No such luck.

409
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,992
Do they know what he replicated?

410
00:23:44,037 --> 00:23:45,266
He wiped the memory core.

411
00:23:45,306 --> 00:23:48,575
Tell Odo I want
all security details

412
00:23:48,613 --> 00:23:50,583
to pull double shifts as of now.

413
00:23:50,618 --> 00:23:53,351
If he wants more men,
have him talk to Gowron.

414
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,827
I'm sure the Chancellor
will be willing

415
00:23:55,863 --> 00:23:59,268
to assign some Klingon troops
to guard key facilities.

416
00:23:59,303 --> 00:24:02,070
Klingons helping
to protect Deep Space 9...

417
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:03,874
what an interesting concept.

418
00:24:03,914 --> 00:24:05,975
These are interesting times,
Major.

419
00:24:06,018 --> 00:24:06,986
Captain.

420
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,321
Incoming message.

421
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:11,660
It's Gul Dukat.

422
00:24:11,697 --> 00:24:13,360
In my office.

423
00:24:19,481 --> 00:24:20,780
Dukat.

424
00:24:20,817 --> 00:24:22,446
Please, Captain...

425
00:24:22,488 --> 00:24:24,618
show a little respect...

426
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:27,826
you are talking to the head
of the Cardassian government.

427
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:30,496
I don't recognize
that government.

428
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:33,238
Your recognition is irrelevant.

429
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:36,045
Well, if that's what you think

430
00:24:36,084 --> 00:24:39,023
why are we having
this conversation?

431
00:24:39,058 --> 00:24:40,857
Because the fact is, Captain

432
00:24:40,895 --> 00:24:43,389
I feel a certain
obligation toward you.

433
00:24:43,434 --> 00:24:46,430
After all, I freely admit,
you saved my life

434
00:24:46,474 --> 00:24:48,341
on more than one occasion.

435
00:24:48,378 --> 00:24:49,505
Don't remind me.

436
00:24:49,547 --> 00:24:51,711
No, no, you should
be glad you did

437
00:24:51,752 --> 00:24:54,656
because now I'm going
to return the favor...

438
00:24:54,691 --> 00:24:58,392
and give you a chance to save
your precious Federation.

439
00:24:58,433 --> 00:25:00,870
All you have to do
is convince them

440
00:25:00,905 --> 00:25:02,841
to follow Cardassia's example.

441
00:25:02,943 --> 00:25:05,346
You expect us
to join the Dominion?

442
00:25:05,382 --> 00:25:08,252
I expect you
to behave rationally.

443
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:12,390
Joining the Dominion
will save billions of lives

444
00:25:12,431 --> 00:25:15,267
and keep the Federation
from fading

445
00:25:15,304 --> 00:25:17,605
into the mists of history.

446
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:19,772
By allowing it
to exist under Dominion rule?

447
00:25:19,814 --> 00:25:21,113
No, thank you.

448
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:24,385
I'm afraid you'll like
the alternative even less.

449
00:25:24,424 --> 00:25:28,091
Dukat, if you have something
to say to me, say it!

450
00:25:28,132 --> 00:25:29,761
Then I'll make it simple.

451
00:25:29,803 --> 00:25:31,602
A few days ago, I swore

452
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,909
all Cardassia lost
would be regained.

453
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,613
That space station
you're so fond of...

454
00:25:38,655 --> 00:25:40,625
was built by Cardassia.

455
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:44,259
Funny, I thought it was built
by Bajoran slave labor.

456
00:25:44,301 --> 00:25:47,240
Either surrender the station

457
00:25:47,274 --> 00:25:50,075
or I'll take it by force.

458
00:25:50,114 --> 00:25:51,549
The choice is yours.

459
00:25:53,621 --> 00:25:57,254
If you want to retake
this station, Dukat

460
00:25:57,296 --> 00:25:59,460
you are welcome to try.

461
00:26:07,284 --> 00:26:10,724
Seven battles
and seven victories.

462
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:13,595
What hero of legend
could have done as well?

463
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:16,229
Heroes of legends
don't ache so much.

464
00:26:16,271 --> 00:26:21,214
Your Federation friends
have taught you modesty

465
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:24,244
but this is no time for modesty.

466
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:26,453
When we return
to the Klingon Empire

467
00:26:26,494 --> 00:26:29,524
I will seek out Keedera himself

468
00:26:29,567 --> 00:26:31,800
and tell him
of your glorious tale.

469
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:33,935
He will write a song
worthy of you.

470
00:26:33,976 --> 00:26:36,311
Well, be sure to send me a copy.

471
00:26:36,348 --> 00:26:37,509
I'll do better than that.

472
00:26:37,551 --> 00:26:41,218
I can make sure
that he mentions you.

473
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:43,457
The healer that bound

474
00:26:43,498 --> 00:26:46,994
the warrior's wounds,
so he could fight again.

475
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,736
Right now, the only part
of the song that I wish to hear

476
00:26:49,777 --> 00:26:51,804
is the verse that tells
of our escape.

477
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:54,013
What good is defeating

478
00:26:54,054 --> 00:26:56,184
every Jem'Hadar soldier
in this compound

479
00:26:56,225 --> 00:26:58,719
if it does not bring us
closer to our freedom?

480
00:26:58,764 --> 00:27:01,065
We have to come up with
a new escape plan.

481
00:27:01,103 --> 00:27:02,402
That won't be necessary.

482
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,146
The original one will work.

483
00:27:09,288 --> 00:27:11,623
I just have to finish
what I started.

484
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,599
After all, a verse
about the Cardassian

485
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:16,465
who panicked
in the face of danger

486
00:27:16,503 --> 00:27:18,268
would ruin
General Martok's song.

487
00:27:18,308 --> 00:27:20,745
That would be unfortunate.

488
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,620
Now, if you'll excuse me...

489
00:27:24,654 --> 00:27:27,421
my dungeon awaits.

490
00:27:37,683 --> 00:27:42,649
There is no greater enemy
than one's own fears.

491
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:45,131
It takes a brave man
to face them.

492
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:02,129
What can I do for you, Chief?

493
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,833
Wasn't Lieutenant Japar
brought in here?

494
00:28:03,874 --> 00:28:05,810
The Klingon engineer?
You just missed him.

495
00:28:05,845 --> 00:28:08,373
The plasma burns weren't as bad
as they looked.

496
00:28:08,418 --> 00:28:09,545
I better go find him.

497
00:28:09,586 --> 00:28:10,679
I can't make head nor tail

498
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,715
of the power-relay systems
on his bird-of-prey.

499
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,785
We're never going to get

500
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:15,230
all these Klingon ships
up and running.

501
00:28:15,266 --> 00:28:17,031
I have every confidence
in you, Chief.

502
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,937
Well, that makes all the
difference then, doesn't it?

503
00:28:18,973 --> 00:28:21,171
How are Keiko and the kids?

504
00:28:21,212 --> 00:28:23,513
They made it safely
to Bajor

505
00:28:23,551 --> 00:28:25,886
but I'm worried about Molly.

506
00:28:25,923 --> 00:28:28,224
She's getting old enough
to know when something's wrong.

507
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,421
I think she's scared.

508
00:28:29,464 --> 00:28:30,763
It's only natural.

509
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:31,767
It'll pass.

510
00:28:31,802 --> 00:28:33,465
Oh, by the way,
I ordered two sets

511
00:28:33,506 --> 00:28:36,069
of those new duridium-alloy
darts I told you about.

512
00:28:36,112 --> 00:28:37,239
They should be here next week.

513
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,806
Darts?

514
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:41,049
We're facing
a major interstellar war

515
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:43,082
and you're thinking about darts?

516
00:28:43,127 --> 00:28:45,063
Well, life must go on.

517
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,829
Besides, I have a feeling

518
00:28:46,869 --> 00:28:49,808
things are going to turn out
for the best.

519
00:28:49,841 --> 00:28:51,902
I hope you're right.

520
00:28:58,828 --> 00:29:01,425
Your asparagus with <i>yamok</i> sauce.

521
00:29:01,467 --> 00:29:05,202
The last of my fresh asparagus,
I might add.

522
00:29:05,242 --> 00:29:07,372
Not that I'll need
to stock it anymore.

523
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:08,712
Somehow I get the feeling

524
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,549
there won't be much
demand for human food

525
00:29:10,587 --> 00:29:13,058
once the Jem'Hadar have
finished with this place.

526
00:29:13,092 --> 00:29:15,222
Aren't you being
a little pessimistic?

527
00:29:15,264 --> 00:29:16,459
Am I?

528
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,233
The Jem'Hadar don't eat,
don't drink

529
00:29:19,273 --> 00:29:20,799
and they don't have sex

530
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:23,508
and if that wasn't bad
enough, the Founders

531
00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:25,075
don't eat and don't drink

532
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:27,146
and they don't have sex either.

533
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:28,591
Which, between you and me

534
00:29:28,627 --> 00:29:31,794
makes my financial future
less than promising.

535
00:29:31,834 --> 00:29:34,738
It might not be so bad.

536
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,140
For all we know

537
00:29:36,177 --> 00:29:39,582
the Vorta could be gluttonous,
alcoholic sex maniacs.

538
00:29:39,618 --> 00:29:42,181
I never thought of that.

539
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:46,561
I wonder
what their favorite food is.

540
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,502
Good news.

541
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:52,010
The Starfleet task force
under Admiral Gilhouly

542
00:29:52,045 --> 00:29:53,480
has entered Bajoran space.

543
00:29:53,515 --> 00:29:55,542
Hope they know
what they're in for.

544
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,027
First, they demand
we come out here.

545
00:30:04,071 --> 00:30:05,472
Then they make us wait.

546
00:30:05,508 --> 00:30:07,137
They are worthy fighters

547
00:30:07,178 --> 00:30:09,615
but they have no sense of honor.

548
00:30:12,156 --> 00:30:15,391
Is there no Jem'Hadar
willing to face me?

549
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,625
Fascinating.

550
00:30:16,665 --> 00:30:18,498
Even after all he's been through

551
00:30:18,537 --> 00:30:20,667
the Klingon still
thirsts for battle.

552
00:30:20,708 --> 00:30:22,234
Doesn't he ever tire of it?

553
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,473
I never do.

554
00:30:23,514 --> 00:30:26,578
You fight because that is
what you were designed to do.

555
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:30,060
All that motivates him
is some barbaric sense of honor.

556
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:33,068
And that is something
you will never understand.

557
00:30:33,102 --> 00:30:34,263
Prepare yourself.

558
00:30:34,305 --> 00:30:36,435
I've found you
a worthy opponent.

559
00:30:36,476 --> 00:30:38,173
Where is he?

560
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:40,514
Right in front of you.

561
00:30:42,656 --> 00:30:44,889
Victory is life.

562
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:48,526
Today is a good day to die.

563
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:03,486
Tain, I don't know
if you can hear me.

564
00:31:03,527 --> 00:31:06,864
But if you can,
I just want you to know

565
00:31:06,968 --> 00:31:10,305
you may not have been
much of a father

566
00:31:10,342 --> 00:31:14,147
but I really wish
you were alive right now.

567
00:31:14,183 --> 00:31:17,988
That way, you could be in here
instead of me.

568
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:34,221
Jem'Hadar.

569
00:31:34,261 --> 00:31:36,288
Can we get him out?

570
00:31:37,334 --> 00:31:38,928
No time.

571
00:31:45,953 --> 00:31:49,154
The Cardassian...
where is he?

572
00:31:49,193 --> 00:31:50,856
Outside...

573
00:31:50,897 --> 00:31:52,298
I suppose.

574
00:31:55,508 --> 00:31:57,102
He is not outside.

575
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,677
Move.

576
00:32:04,928 --> 00:32:07,661
What do you want with him?

577
00:32:07,701 --> 00:32:10,765
He is to be put to death.

578
00:32:10,808 --> 00:32:12,107
Sir!

579
00:32:21,298 --> 00:32:24,965
If you wish to live

580
00:32:25,072 --> 00:32:27,908
explain this.

581
00:32:32,522 --> 00:32:34,993
The Bird-of-Prey <i>Y'tem</i>
is in position.

582
00:32:35,094 --> 00:32:36,427
That's everybody.

583
00:32:36,464 --> 00:32:37,659
Major. Commander.

584
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,260
Report to the <i>Defiant.</i>

585
00:32:39,303 --> 00:32:40,772
Yes, sir.

586
00:32:40,807 --> 00:32:42,868
Good luck.

587
00:32:42,912 --> 00:32:44,882
To all of us.

588
00:32:52,566 --> 00:32:54,399
Deploy the runabouts.

589
00:33:09,604 --> 00:33:11,837
Runabout <i>Yukon,</i>
prepare for departure.

590
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:15,007
Runabouts <i>Rio Grande</i>
and <i>Volga,</i> stand by.

591
00:33:15,116 --> 00:33:16,983
<i>Yukon</i> ready.

592
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:20,016
Engines engaged.

593
00:33:20,127 --> 00:33:21,653
Good luck, <i>Yukon.</i>

594
00:33:33,256 --> 00:33:35,819
Sir, I'm picking up
a large tachyon buildup.

595
00:33:35,861 --> 00:33:37,694
Multiple vectors.

596
00:33:37,732 --> 00:33:39,965
Ships de-cloaking.

597
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:55,266
Romulans.

598
00:33:55,304 --> 00:33:58,105
They're requesting permission
to join the fleet.

599
00:33:58,144 --> 00:33:59,339
I'll be damned.

600
00:33:59,379 --> 00:34:00,678
Permission granted.

601
00:34:00,716 --> 00:34:02,015
<i>Defiant</i> to Ops.

602
00:34:02,053 --> 00:34:03,682
Go ahead, Major.

603
00:34:03,723 --> 00:34:07,562
Sensors have just detected
Dominion and Cardassian ships

604
00:34:07,598 --> 00:34:09,363
entering Bajoran space.

605
00:34:09,401 --> 00:34:10,927
ETA ten minutes.

606
00:34:17,954 --> 00:34:21,621
I'll ask you for the last time...
what is this?

607
00:34:21,662 --> 00:34:24,726
It's either
a self-sealing stem bolt

608
00:34:24,769 --> 00:34:26,636
or a reverse-ratcheting
router.

609
00:34:26,673 --> 00:34:29,167
I'm just not sure.

610
00:34:34,123 --> 00:34:35,683
She is next.

611
00:34:35,726 --> 00:34:37,127
Sir!

612
00:34:38,265 --> 00:34:39,962
If you'll allow me?

613
00:35:07,061 --> 00:35:08,690
Worf...

614
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:11,568
honor has been satisfied.

615
00:35:11,605 --> 00:35:13,074
Stay down.

616
00:35:26,605 --> 00:35:28,131
Finish this.

617
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:51,458
What do you see?

618
00:35:52,862 --> 00:35:54,627
I see nothing.

619
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:56,159
It's dark.

620
00:36:14,042 --> 00:36:16,172
My people have a saying:

621
00:36:16,213 --> 00:36:19,014
Never turn your back
on a Breen.

622
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:21,354
Doctor, would you keep
the noise down?

623
00:36:21,392 --> 00:36:23,225
I'm trying to work in here.

624
00:36:23,296 --> 00:36:25,699
Garak, how many transtator
circuits have you got left?

625
00:36:25,735 --> 00:36:26,703
Three.

626
00:36:26,737 --> 00:36:28,070
Well, work fast,
because pretty soon

627
00:36:28,107 --> 00:36:29,872
we're going to be up
to our necks in Jem'Hadar.

628
00:36:47,382 --> 00:36:48,851
Enough, Klingon.

629
00:36:48,885 --> 00:36:50,445
You have proven your worth.

630
00:36:50,488 --> 00:36:51,513
Worf...

631
00:36:51,558 --> 00:36:52,822
you heard him.

632
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,055
Enough.

633
00:36:54,097 --> 00:36:55,999
I will not yield!

634
00:36:57,805 --> 00:37:00,003
What are you waiting for?
End this.

635
00:37:00,043 --> 00:37:02,104
It's over.

636
00:37:02,147 --> 00:37:03,810
It is not over.

637
00:37:03,851 --> 00:37:05,343
You heard him.

638
00:37:16,613 --> 00:37:18,982
I yield.

639
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:20,716
You what?

640
00:37:20,756 --> 00:37:22,248
I yield!

641
00:37:22,293 --> 00:37:25,289
I cannot defeat this Klingon.

642
00:37:25,332 --> 00:37:27,393
All I can do is kill him

643
00:37:27,437 --> 00:37:31,172
and that no longer
holds my interest.

644
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:35,885
Shoot them both.

645
00:37:37,326 --> 00:37:39,159
Got it!

646
00:37:51,724 --> 00:37:53,557
Take him to one
of the cabins in the back.

647
00:37:53,594 --> 00:37:55,564
I'll be with you
as soon as I can.

648
00:37:58,572 --> 00:37:59,631
Garak.

649
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:03,810
You did well.

650
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,717
So did you.

651
00:38:08,594 --> 00:38:10,655
Take us to maximum warp,
Garak.

652
00:38:10,699 --> 00:38:13,102
We've got to get
a message to the station.

653
00:38:18,114 --> 00:38:20,175
The Dominion fleet
should be in visual range.

654
00:38:20,219 --> 00:38:21,813
On screen.

655
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,828
Where are they?

656
00:38:24,863 --> 00:38:26,457
According
to their warp signatures

657
00:38:26,499 --> 00:38:27,968
they should be right there.

658
00:38:28,003 --> 00:38:29,939
Some kind of cloaking device?

659
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,637
I didn't know
the Dominion had them.

660
00:38:31,678 --> 00:38:34,377
Or the Cardassians,
for that matter.

661
00:38:34,484 --> 00:38:38,185
I'm picking up
additional warp signatures

662
00:38:38,226 --> 00:38:43,295
bearing 183 mark 97.

663
00:38:43,337 --> 00:38:46,367
244 mark 12.

664
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:50,351
302 mark 133.

665
00:38:50,385 --> 00:38:51,580
<i>Defiant</i> to Ops.

666
00:38:51,622 --> 00:38:52,749
Go ahead.

667
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:54,921
According
to our sensor readings

668
00:38:54,963 --> 00:38:56,660
there are Dominion ships
all around us

669
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,591
but we can't see them or get
any kind of targeting lock.

670
00:38:58,724 --> 00:39:00,751
We're reading the same thing.

671
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:02,698
They're everywhere.

672
00:39:02,767 --> 00:39:04,202
What are your orders, Captain?

673
00:39:04,237 --> 00:39:06,173
Chief!
I need targets!

674
00:39:06,207 --> 00:39:08,177
I'm trying,
but I can't get anything.

675
00:39:08,211 --> 00:39:10,546
We may have to wait for them
to open fire and then...

676
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,593
Captain, I'm picking up
a priority one message

677
00:39:14,626 --> 00:39:16,186
from the Gamma Quadrant.

678
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:17,926
It's Dr. Bashir!

679
00:39:17,966 --> 00:39:19,161
Bashir?

680
00:39:19,203 --> 00:39:21,299
Computer, locate Dr. Bashir.

681
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:24,210
Dr. Bashir
is not on the station.

682
00:39:24,247 --> 00:39:26,878
What was
his last known location?

683
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,659
Dr. Bashir's last known location
was Runabout Pad E.

684
00:39:31,697 --> 00:39:34,066
Sisko to <i>Defiant.</i>

685
00:39:34,103 --> 00:39:35,071
Go ahead.

686
00:39:35,105 --> 00:39:36,404
Major, you have new orders.

687
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,467
I want you to find
the <i>Yukon</i> and destroy it

688
00:39:38,512 --> 00:39:39,411
at any cost.

689
00:39:39,447 --> 00:39:40,415
Is that clear?

690
00:39:40,449 --> 00:39:42,112
Yes, sir.

691
00:39:42,153 --> 00:39:43,486
Commander.

692
00:39:43,523 --> 00:39:46,655
The <i>Yukon</i> is headed straight
for the Bajoran sun.

693
00:39:59,758 --> 00:40:01,591
Its shields are holding.

694
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,566
How can that be?

695
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,801
Looks like someone's been doing
some modifications to the <i>Yukon.</i>

696
00:40:06,841 --> 00:40:09,039
I'm also picking up
large amounts of trilithium

697
00:40:09,078 --> 00:40:11,379
tekasite and protomatter
on board.

698
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:12,385
A bomb.

699
00:40:12,419 --> 00:40:14,389
If it explodes inside the sun...

700
00:40:14,424 --> 00:40:16,291
It could trigger a supernova...

701
00:40:16,328 --> 00:40:18,799
wipe out the entire
fleet, the station...

702
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:20,063
And Bajor.

703
00:40:20,103 --> 00:40:21,572
We have to use
the tractor beams.

704
00:40:21,606 --> 00:40:22,973
We're too far away.

705
00:40:23,009 --> 00:40:24,569
Want to bet?
Take us to warp.

706
00:40:24,613 --> 00:40:25,980
Inside a solar system?!

707
00:40:26,016 --> 00:40:29,387
If we don't, there won't
be a solar system left.

708
00:40:48,499 --> 00:40:50,298
The runabout's been destroyed.

709
00:40:50,336 --> 00:40:53,309
If the sun had gone nova

710
00:40:53,342 --> 00:40:56,109
it would have wiped out
the Dominion fleet, too.

711
00:40:56,149 --> 00:40:59,145
Chief, scan for
those warp signatures again.

712
00:41:00,927 --> 00:41:02,122
Captain...

713
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,228
They're gone, aren't they?

714
00:41:05,269 --> 00:41:08,002
All I'm reading is
normal background radiation.

715
00:41:08,042 --> 00:41:11,743
The warp signatures
must have been faked.

716
00:41:11,784 --> 00:41:14,916
The Dominion's real fleet
never left Cardassian space.

717
00:41:14,957 --> 00:41:18,624
This was all an elaborate trap...

718
00:41:18,665 --> 00:41:21,262
an attempt to destroy
the station and Bajor

719
00:41:21,304 --> 00:41:24,105
and cripple the Federation
and Klingon fleets

720
00:41:24,143 --> 00:41:27,776
without ever firing a shot.

721
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:30,917
Tell our friends out there
to stand down.

722
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:35,526
Armageddon will have to wait
for another day.

723
00:41:40,513 --> 00:41:41,674
Ziyal?

724
00:41:43,787 --> 00:41:45,586
I told you I'd be back.

725
00:41:50,235 --> 00:41:52,296
I never doubted it.

726
00:41:57,517 --> 00:41:58,485
Four weeks?

727
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,581
Are you telling me
I've been hanging around

728
00:42:00,624 --> 00:42:02,321
with a changeling
for over a month?

729
00:42:02,361 --> 00:42:05,334
And you never even suspected
it wasn't me?

730
00:42:05,368 --> 00:42:07,133
No, and the worst part is

731
00:42:07,172 --> 00:42:09,803
the clues were right
in front of me.

732
00:42:09,844 --> 00:42:10,971
What clues?

733
00:42:11,014 --> 00:42:12,347
Well, for one thing

734
00:42:12,383 --> 00:42:14,980
he was a lot easier
to get along with.

735
00:42:18,997 --> 00:42:21,560
So, I suppose
this means you want

736
00:42:21,603 --> 00:42:24,507
your Klingon opera
collection back.

737
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:25,807
Intact.

738
00:42:25,846 --> 00:42:28,215
More or less.

739
00:42:34,432 --> 00:42:36,026
Then it's settled.

740
00:42:36,102 --> 00:42:37,867
In light of the new treaty

741
00:42:37,906 --> 00:42:40,036
and the continued
Dominion threat

742
00:42:40,077 --> 00:42:41,376
to the Alpha Quadrant

743
00:42:41,413 --> 00:42:44,853
there will be a permanent
Klingon military presence

744
00:42:44,888 --> 00:42:46,858
on this station.

745
00:42:46,893 --> 00:42:49,763
But I choose the Commander.

746
00:42:49,798 --> 00:42:51,097
Agreed.

747
00:42:55,545 --> 00:42:58,381
Mr. Worf thinks very highly
of you, General.

748
00:43:00,889 --> 00:43:03,019
I think very highly of him.

749
00:43:03,061 --> 00:43:06,193
Then I can't think
of a better man for the job

750
00:43:06,235 --> 00:43:08,900
if you'll take it.

751
00:43:11,446 --> 00:43:13,542
I would be honored.

752
00:43:13,585 --> 00:43:14,986
Ops to Sisko.

753
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,045
Sisko here.

754
00:43:16,157 --> 00:43:18,287
You're receiving
an incoming message.

755
00:43:18,328 --> 00:43:20,595
It's from Dukat.

756
00:43:20,633 --> 00:43:24,073
Well, Captain,
I must congratulate you.

757
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:28,343
If that protomatter device
had gone off inside the sun...

758
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:31,823
Well... the death toll
would have been enormous.

759
00:43:31,857 --> 00:43:33,086
And your daughter

760
00:43:33,127 --> 00:43:35,564
would have been
one of the casualties.

761
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,766
Ziyal made her choice.

762
00:43:38,806 --> 00:43:43,111
As far as I'm concerned,
she's no longer my daughter.

763
00:43:43,182 --> 00:43:45,346
You know, Dukat,
I thought you'd changed

764
00:43:45,388 --> 00:43:46,880
in the last five years.

765
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:48,119
I see I was wrong.

766
00:43:48,227 --> 00:43:49,526
One man's villain

767
00:43:49,563 --> 00:43:53,094
is another man's hero, Captain.

768
00:43:53,138 --> 00:43:55,803
You should see the monument
they're erecting in my honor

769
00:43:55,843 --> 00:43:57,403
at the gateway
to the Imperial Plaza.

770
00:43:57,447 --> 00:43:58,415
Is that why

771
00:43:58,449 --> 00:44:00,818
you sold out your people
to the Dominion?

772
00:44:00,854 --> 00:44:02,015
For a monument?!

773
00:44:02,058 --> 00:44:04,586
What I did...

774
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:08,765
I did to make Cardassia
strong again.

775
00:44:08,806 --> 00:44:12,439
And mark my words, Captain,
I succeeded.

776
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,444
You may have escaped defeat
this day

777
00:44:16,489 --> 00:44:18,083
but tomorrow...

778
00:44:18,126 --> 00:44:20,096
We will see about tomorrow.

779
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:22,123
Yes, we will.
