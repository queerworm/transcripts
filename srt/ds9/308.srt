1
00:00:15,722 --> 00:00:17,020
Too hot?

2
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:18,026
A little.

3
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,586
Ah.

4
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,796
Why don't you specify
a lower temperature?

5
00:00:22,836 --> 00:00:23,997
No, no, no, no.

6
00:00:24,038 --> 00:00:26,508
Coffee should be a little
too hot to drink right away.

7
00:00:26,544 --> 00:00:28,343
Why?

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,375
Lt, uh, slows down
the experience

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,392
gives you time
to savor the taste.

10
00:00:34,426 --> 00:00:35,894
Ah, yes...

11
00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:37,558
taste.

12
00:00:37,599 --> 00:00:40,230
Odo, I know you don't

13
00:00:40,337 --> 00:00:44,004
need to eat, but did you
ever try it anyway?

14
00:00:46,617 --> 00:00:48,450
Once.

15
00:00:48,487 --> 00:00:51,254
Not long after I was
first able to assume

16
00:00:51,293 --> 00:00:53,263
the humanoid form.

17
00:00:53,297 --> 00:00:55,096
And?

18
00:00:55,134 --> 00:01:00,236
And since I don't
have taste buds

19
00:01:00,277 --> 00:01:03,978
it was very unsatisfying...

20
00:01:04,018 --> 00:01:06,615
not to mention messy.

21
00:01:06,657 --> 00:01:08,650
Messy?!

22
00:01:08,695 --> 00:01:10,892
I'd rather not talk about it.

23
00:01:10,932 --> 00:01:13,334
Major Kira.

24
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,035
How nice to see you again.

25
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,374
Tiron.

26
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,108
You left Quark's last night,
just when I

27
00:01:19,148 --> 00:01:20,913
was about to buy
everyone another round.

28
00:01:20,952 --> 00:01:23,924
I was devastated
that you didn't say good-bye

29
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:27,192
and we were having such
a pleasant conversation.

30
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:30,726
As I recall, you were the one
doing all the talking.

31
00:01:30,772 --> 00:01:33,767
Well, in that case,
you have me at a disadvantage.

32
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:37,376
You know all about me and I
know next to nothing about you.

33
00:01:37,418 --> 00:01:40,720
Uh... perhaps I should be going.

34
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,729
Oh, no. Stay.

35
00:01:42,763 --> 00:01:46,760
This is Tiron,
a business associate of Quark's.

36
00:01:46,804 --> 00:01:49,297
This is Odo...

37
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,208
my lover.

38
00:01:54,653 --> 00:01:56,144
Well...

39
00:01:58,026 --> 00:01:59,791
you're a very lucky man.

40
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:03,565
I'm a lucky woman.

41
00:02:03,604 --> 00:02:07,977
Yes... we're both very lucky.

42
00:02:08,013 --> 00:02:13,685
And you make a most...
interesting couple.

43
00:02:13,725 --> 00:02:18,531
So, Mr. Odo,
what is it that you do?

44
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:21,300
I'm Chief of Security
on this station.

45
00:02:21,339 --> 00:02:22,705
Oh.

46
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:24,645
A station this size

47
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,481
it must be
a very challenging job.

48
00:02:27,518 --> 00:02:30,319
I hope you're well compensated.

49
00:02:30,424 --> 00:02:32,451
Oh, money doesn't matter.

50
00:02:32,495 --> 00:02:34,192
All we need is each other.

51
00:02:34,232 --> 00:02:35,758
Isn't that right...

52
00:02:35,802 --> 00:02:37,431
sweetheart?

53
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:39,100
Yes...

54
00:02:39,142 --> 00:02:41,544
sweetheart.

55
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:45,178
You see, money isn't everything.

56
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,094
Oh, no,
but it can buy everything.

57
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,661
Well, I'm afraid
I must be going.

58
00:02:53,705 --> 00:02:55,607
Good-bye.

59
00:03:02,154 --> 00:03:03,851
Oh, good riddance.

60
00:03:03,891 --> 00:03:05,520
Thank you, Odo.

61
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:08,692
Wish you'd been
around last night.

62
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:10,602
I better get back to Ops.

63
00:03:10,637 --> 00:03:13,005
See you later, sweetheart.

64
00:03:19,355 --> 00:03:23,455
Commander's Log,
Stardate 48423.2.

65
00:03:23,497 --> 00:03:26,128
Despite the continuing threat
posed by the Dominion

66
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:28,834
I've convinced Starfleet
that we must continue

67
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,902
our exploration
of the Gamma Quadrant.

68
00:03:32,783 --> 00:03:35,151
I've run a preliminary
analysis of our sensor sweeps

69
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:37,054
and the second planet
in the Kylata system

70
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,116
is definitely M-Class.

71
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,389
I wish we'd had time

72
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,398
to beam down to the surface
and take a closer look.

73
00:03:41,499 --> 00:03:42,524
Yeah, but I'd hate

74
00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:43,866
to have run
into a Jem'Hadar patrol

75
00:03:43,905 --> 00:03:45,396
while we were down there
picking flowers.

76
00:03:45,507 --> 00:03:46,873
Fortunately, there's no sign

77
00:03:46,911 --> 00:03:48,540
of any Dominion activity
in this sector.

78
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,413
And let's hope
it stays that way.

79
00:03:50,517 --> 00:03:53,717
I'm picking up very unusual
gravimetric distortions

80
00:03:53,758 --> 00:03:55,056
in the Trialus system.

81
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:56,687
Any idea what's causing them?

82
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:58,255
It's hard to tell at this range.

83
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,791
Let's take a closer look.

84
00:04:06,316 --> 00:04:07,842
The system's coming
into visual range.

85
00:04:07,886 --> 00:04:09,549
On screen.

86
00:04:11,192 --> 00:04:13,389
The gravimetric distortions
are intensifying

87
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,402
but they don't seem to be coming
from the star itself.

88
00:04:16,436 --> 00:04:18,167
But where else
could they be coming from?

89
00:04:18,206 --> 00:04:19,971
There aren't any planets
in this system.

90
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,826
There are now.

91
00:06:27,646 --> 00:06:30,209
The planet seems to have settled
into a stable orbit.

92
00:06:30,252 --> 00:06:31,618
But where did it come from?

93
00:06:31,654 --> 00:06:33,556
Could the entire planet
have been cloaked?

94
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:35,788
If it was, there should be
residual ionization traces

95
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,731
but I'm not reading any.

96
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:39,234
Commander, we're being scanned.

97
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,672
The beam is coming
from a settlement

98
00:06:41,707 --> 00:06:43,438
on the southern hemisphere.

99
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:46,678
I'm reading approximately
30 humanoid inhabitants.

100
00:06:46,717 --> 00:06:48,914
They seem to be the only
humanoids on the planet.

101
00:06:48,956 --> 00:06:50,015
They're hailing us.

102
00:06:50,058 --> 00:06:51,823
Open a channel.

103
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,737
I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko
of the Federation Starbase

104
00:06:59,777 --> 00:07:01,406
Deep Space 9.

105
00:07:01,447 --> 00:07:03,781
I am Seltin Rakal of Meridian.

106
00:07:03,818 --> 00:07:07,451
We were studying the star system
when your planet appeared.

107
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:11,865
I expect it must have come
as something of a surprise.

108
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:13,427
Well, you could say that.

109
00:07:13,471 --> 00:07:15,668
It seemed to come
out of nowhere.

110
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:17,770
Not nowhere, Commander

111
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:21,548
but from a dimension
that intersects with this one.

112
00:07:21,587 --> 00:07:25,857
I could explain more in detail,
if you're interested.

113
00:07:25,895 --> 00:07:28,594
We were just about
to sit down for First Meal.

114
00:07:28,635 --> 00:07:30,298
Why don't you join us?

115
00:07:31,707 --> 00:07:33,643
We'd like that.

116
00:07:33,678 --> 00:07:34,976
I just need to know

117
00:07:35,015 --> 00:07:36,678
your planet is not
going to disappear

118
00:07:36,717 --> 00:07:37,912
in the middle of dessert.

119
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:40,319
Don't worry.

120
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:42,487
We'll be here for a while.

121
00:07:56,557 --> 00:07:58,959
It's good to be together

122
00:07:58,996 --> 00:08:01,729
around this table again
after so long.

123
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:05,137
What's more,
we're fortunate to have visitors

124
00:08:05,175 --> 00:08:07,577
to share First Meal with us.

125
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:13,478
I was admiring...
your markings.

126
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,429
Are they decorative?

127
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:19,936
No. Are yours?

128
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,635
No.

129
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:25,978
If you don't mind my asking...

130
00:08:26,016 --> 00:08:29,455
how far down do they go?

131
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,824
All the way.

132
00:08:31,861 --> 00:08:33,352
Ah.

133
00:08:35,235 --> 00:08:37,102
You're not eating, Commander.

134
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:40,236
I guess my curiosity is
bigger than my appetite.

135
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,508
I hope we can satisfy both.

136
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:44,109
Hmm.

137
00:08:44,153 --> 00:08:47,752
Well, you were saying
Meridian emerged

138
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,592
from a dimension that intersects
with this one?

139
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,928
Yes.

140
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:54,369
You see, our planet
has a dual existence.

141
00:08:54,406 --> 00:08:58,039
It shifts between this dimension
and another.

142
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,448
What causes these shifts?

143
00:09:00,485 --> 00:09:02,045
Well, we're not entirely sure.

144
00:09:02,088 --> 00:09:04,217
Deral has been studying
the phenomenon.

145
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:07,231
With only limited success,
I'm afraid.

146
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:10,396
My theory is that the
dimensional shifts are caused

147
00:09:10,438 --> 00:09:12,908
by fluctuations
in Meridian's quantum matrix...

148
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:15,744
fluctuations that are somehow
triggered by our own sun.

149
00:09:15,782 --> 00:09:18,014
What's it like,
this dimension of yours?

150
00:09:18,053 --> 00:09:20,250
It's hard to explain.

151
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,523
It's... without form.

152
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,557
We exist as pure consciousness.

153
00:09:25,602 --> 00:09:27,367
And Meridian?

154
00:09:27,405 --> 00:09:29,773
It becomes noncorporeal as well

155
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,577
but when we return
to this dimension

156
00:09:32,616 --> 00:09:35,052
everything is just
as we left it...

157
00:09:35,088 --> 00:09:38,219
the buildings, the trees,
even our bodies.

158
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:40,663
Are you saying
that when you return here

159
00:09:40,698 --> 00:09:42,793
it's as if no time has passed?

160
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:45,603
We only age when we're
in corporeal form.

161
00:09:45,642 --> 00:09:49,137
Sounds like this other dimension
has its advantages.

162
00:09:49,182 --> 00:09:50,845
Yes...

163
00:09:50,885 --> 00:09:53,618
but we always look
forward to this existence

164
00:09:53,658 --> 00:09:55,355
and its many pleasures.

165
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,861
Oh, here, let me
help you with that.

166
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:02,568
The trick is
to scoop out the pulp

167
00:10:02,609 --> 00:10:06,344
and eat the thin layer
inside the rind.

168
00:10:06,383 --> 00:10:08,046
Here, try some.

169
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,166
It's delicious.

170
00:10:15,201 --> 00:10:16,362
Especially if you've been

171
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,269
looking forward to it
for 60 years.

172
00:10:18,307 --> 00:10:19,366
60 years?

173
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:20,604
Mm-hmm.

174
00:10:20,645 --> 00:10:24,015
Huh. That's a long time
between meals.

175
00:10:39,683 --> 00:10:42,416
A glass of Andorian ale.

176
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:43,889
Done so soon?

177
00:10:43,924 --> 00:10:45,894
You were barely
in the holosuite ten minutes.

178
00:10:45,928 --> 00:10:48,832
There was no reason for me
to stay the full hour.

179
00:10:48,868 --> 00:10:49,836
I understand.

180
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:54,072
It's a very...
effective program.

181
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,740
On the contrary,
I found it to be

182
00:10:55,782 --> 00:10:59,745
quite dull... boring,
boring, boring!

183
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,760
I'm sorry to hear you say that

184
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:04,196
but if you're asking
for a refund, forget it.

185
00:11:04,232 --> 00:11:06,863
The contract specifically
says that satisfaction

186
00:11:06,904 --> 00:11:09,238
is not guaranteed.

187
00:11:09,276 --> 00:11:14,412
But... for a valued customer
such as yourself

188
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,079
I'll make an exception

189
00:11:16,122 --> 00:11:19,185
and allow you to try
a different program...

190
00:11:19,229 --> 00:11:21,826
no extra charge.

191
00:11:23,771 --> 00:11:25,365
Let's see.

192
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:29,542
Something a little bit more...

193
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,212
unique?

194
00:11:31,253 --> 00:11:35,091
Oh, I have just the thing...

195
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,097
"A picnic with
the Pleasure Goddess of Rixx."

196
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:39,830
I can even provide real food,
for a small fee, of course.

197
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:44,471
I don't like picnics, Quark,
and the food here is abominable.

198
00:11:44,513 --> 00:11:45,981
Forget the food.

199
00:11:46,015 --> 00:11:49,249
Believe me, you've never
had a picnic like this one.

200
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:54,664
What I want
is not in your catalog.

201
00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:57,830
Well, tell me what it is
and I'll order it for you.

202
00:11:57,872 --> 00:12:00,365
It may take some time,
but, if it exists, I'll get it.

203
00:12:00,411 --> 00:12:02,904
That's just the point, Quark.

204
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:05,580
The program I want
doesn't exist.

205
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:07,089
Not yet, anyway.

206
00:12:07,124 --> 00:12:10,723
A custom program...

207
00:12:10,765 --> 00:12:12,530
it'll be expensive.

208
00:12:22,622 --> 00:12:27,029
Oh, for that kind of money,
you can move into a holosuite.

209
00:12:27,064 --> 00:12:29,159
Now, what is it you want?

210
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:30,830
I want...

211
00:12:30,872 --> 00:12:33,365
Major Kira.

212
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,878
Kir...

213
00:12:34,913 --> 00:12:38,283
What are you going to do
with Kira in a holosuite?

214
00:12:39,923 --> 00:12:41,859
No... don't tell me.

215
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,921
I don't want to know.

216
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:45,695
Can you do it?

217
00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:46,703
It isn't going to be easy.

218
00:12:46,737 --> 00:12:48,171
I'll have to get her
into the holosuite

219
00:12:48,206 --> 00:12:51,201
and record her image,
and she hates holosuites.

220
00:12:51,245 --> 00:12:52,874
Spare me the details.

221
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:56,447
Do we have a deal or do I
take my business elsewhere?

222
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:01,999
Consider it done.

223
00:13:02,034 --> 00:13:04,368
Now, I'll just keep this...

224
00:13:04,406 --> 00:13:09,508
Payment on delivery
and not a moment sooner.

225
00:13:11,687 --> 00:13:13,919
Don't disappoint me, Quark.

226
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:19,299
When I walk into that holosuite
and I see Kira standing there...

227
00:13:21,573 --> 00:13:24,043
I'd better believe
it's really her.

228
00:13:25,815 --> 00:13:27,876
Leave it to me.

229
00:13:30,925 --> 00:13:32,416
Mm-hmm.

230
00:13:36,803 --> 00:13:39,171
The things I do for money.

231
00:13:42,749 --> 00:13:44,446
Just beyond that forest

232
00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:46,786
there's a garden
with a small pond.

233
00:13:46,823 --> 00:13:48,520
It sounds lovely.

234
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,030
It is.

235
00:13:51,065 --> 00:13:52,694
Deral, our scans show
that there are

236
00:13:52,735 --> 00:13:54,762
only about 30 of you
on this entire planet.

237
00:13:54,806 --> 00:13:57,072
Well, there were
never many of us.

238
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,773
We're the descendants
of an expedition

239
00:13:58,814 --> 00:14:01,080
that was stranded here
millennia ago.

240
00:14:01,118 --> 00:14:03,715
And your population hasn't
increased since then?

241
00:14:03,757 --> 00:14:05,020
It did for a time

242
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:09,524
but over the last few centuries,
our numbers have dwindled.

243
00:14:09,569 --> 00:14:13,509
You see, we only reproduce
when we're in humanoid form

244
00:14:13,544 --> 00:14:17,484
and our time here
keeps growing shorter.

245
00:14:17,518 --> 00:14:22,984
In 12 days, Meridian will shift
back to its noncorporeal state.

246
00:14:24,466 --> 00:14:27,563
And remain there
for the next 60 years.

247
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:31,511
Eventually, we will only be here
for a matter of minutes.

248
00:14:31,546 --> 00:14:35,007
When that happens,
Meridian will be too unstable

249
00:14:35,053 --> 00:14:38,389
to successfully shift back
to the other dimension.

250
00:14:39,996 --> 00:14:42,330
And then what happens?

251
00:14:42,367 --> 00:14:44,428
The planet
and all its inhabitants

252
00:14:44,472 --> 00:14:46,465
will cease to exist...

253
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,209
in either dimension.

254
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,441
We deeply appreciate
your offer of help, Commander.

255
00:15:03,481 --> 00:15:06,078
If there is a way to stabilize
the dimensional shifts

256
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:07,713
we'll do everything
we can to find it.

257
00:15:07,756 --> 00:15:09,316
That's all we can ask.

258
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:11,386
Aha. Here you go.

259
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,024
Do you want to play
<i>vajhaq</i> with us?

260
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:15,536
Maybe later.

261
00:15:20,882 --> 00:15:23,045
Deral and I are beaming
up to the <i>Defiant.</i>

262
00:15:23,086 --> 00:15:25,454
We're going to run a series
of helio-seismic scans

263
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:27,086
on the Meridian sun.

264
00:15:27,128 --> 00:15:29,291
I'll join you.

265
00:15:29,332 --> 00:15:30,926
Good luck.

266
00:15:47,101 --> 00:15:49,264
Dabo!

267
00:15:52,946 --> 00:15:54,244
Quark.

268
00:15:54,282 --> 00:15:56,479
I got a message that Morn
wanted to see me.

269
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,253
I'm afraid you just missed him.

270
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,921
Really?

271
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:02,190
So soon?

272
00:16:02,231 --> 00:16:04,394
Would you come with me, please?

273
00:16:05,404 --> 00:16:07,271
Listen up, everyone.

274
00:16:07,308 --> 00:16:09,801
I have wonderful news.

275
00:16:09,847 --> 00:16:13,251
It's my pleasure to announce
that my one-millionth customer

276
00:16:13,286 --> 00:16:14,686
just walked through the door.

277
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,818
And here she is,
ladies and gentlemen

278
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:18,888
Major Kira Nerys.

279
00:16:18,931 --> 00:16:22,267
Quark! I don't
have time for this.

280
00:16:22,304 --> 00:16:25,504
Why don't you make him
your one-millionth customer?

281
00:16:25,545 --> 00:16:27,242
But, Major, that
would be dishonest.

282
00:16:27,281 --> 00:16:28,374
That never stopped you before.

283
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:29,851
But this is
a special occasion.

284
00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:32,916
An event like this only happens
once in a bar owner's lifetime.

285
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:34,460
Let me tell you
about your prizes.

286
00:16:35,464 --> 00:16:37,400
You mean, I won something?

287
00:16:37,435 --> 00:16:39,166
Of course, you won something.

288
00:16:39,205 --> 00:16:40,936
It's part of the celebration.

289
00:16:40,975 --> 00:16:43,411
I never won anything before.

290
00:16:43,447 --> 00:16:45,747
Well, now you have.
Congratulations.

291
00:16:45,785 --> 00:16:47,846
Are you really
serious about this?

292
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:49,688
My customers are
my livelihood, Major.

293
00:16:49,726 --> 00:16:51,958
This is a chance for me
to give something back to them.

294
00:16:51,997 --> 00:16:54,730
Now, let's see
what we have for you.

295
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,111
A bottle of Kandora champagne,
vintage 2368...

296
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:02,743
that's a very good year.

297
00:17:02,786 --> 00:17:07,524
These are good for five
free spins at the dabo wheel.

298
00:17:07,562 --> 00:17:09,361
And last but not least

299
00:17:09,398 --> 00:17:12,564
one free hour in a holosuite
with the program of your choice.

300
00:17:12,606 --> 00:17:14,405
Wait... a visit to a holosuite?

301
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:15,410
Offer good today only.

302
00:17:15,444 --> 00:17:16,412
But that's perfect.

303
00:17:16,446 --> 00:17:17,414
Right this way.

304
00:17:17,448 --> 00:17:18,780
It's Ensign Quintana's birthday.

305
00:17:18,818 --> 00:17:21,254
He'd love a free visit
to the holosuite.

306
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:24,888
But, Major, what about you?

307
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,298
Oh, you know how I feel
about the holosuites, Quark

308
00:17:27,334 --> 00:17:30,329
but, uh... thanks
for the champagne.

309
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:45,100
These are the <i>Defiant's</i>
sensor readings

310
00:17:45,137 --> 00:17:46,731
when we first
entered the system.

311
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,869
Take a look
at the spectral scan.

312
00:17:48,911 --> 00:17:50,106
It indicates that your sun

313
00:17:50,147 --> 00:17:51,912
was giving off
modulated gamma bursts

314
00:17:51,951 --> 00:17:53,750
right before Meridian
appeared.

315
00:17:53,788 --> 00:17:55,883
My people have no record
of that phenomenon.

316
00:17:55,925 --> 00:17:58,225
That's not surprising,
since Meridian was

317
00:17:58,263 --> 00:18:00,631
in a noncorporeal state
when it occurred.

318
00:18:00,668 --> 00:18:03,265
Gamma activity
would seem to indicate

319
00:18:03,306 --> 00:18:05,971
an anomaly
in your sun's fusion cycle.

320
00:18:06,045 --> 00:18:07,479
Let's find out for sure.

321
00:18:07,514 --> 00:18:09,211
Chief, I want you
to send a probe

322
00:18:09,251 --> 00:18:11,312
into the sun's corona
to scan the core.

323
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:14,021
It'll take a minute to modify
the shield configuration.

324
00:18:15,263 --> 00:18:19,294
How do modulated gamma bursts
cause a dimensional shift?

325
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:24,947
Do you always do that
when you're concentrating?

326
00:18:24,983 --> 00:18:27,010
Do what?

327
00:18:27,087 --> 00:18:29,353
Bite your lower lip.

328
00:18:31,764 --> 00:18:33,927
I guess I do.

329
00:18:33,968 --> 00:18:35,870
Probe's ready, Commander.

330
00:18:35,905 --> 00:18:39,207
Target it to these
coordinates and launch.

331
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:47,853
Shields are holding.

332
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:52,066
It's going to be a while

333
00:18:52,171 --> 00:18:55,632
before the probe starts
sending back any telemetry.

334
00:18:55,678 --> 00:18:58,878
Well, I'm sure you have
things you need to do.

335
00:19:01,422 --> 00:19:03,722
Not really.

336
00:19:03,761 --> 00:19:06,392
What a coincidence.

337
00:19:06,432 --> 00:19:07,900
Neither do I.

338
00:19:09,271 --> 00:19:12,266
This isn't turning out
exactly the way I planned.

339
00:19:12,311 --> 00:19:13,540
What do you mean?

340
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,812
You've barely spoken a word
since we left the settlement.

341
00:19:15,852 --> 00:19:17,286
I don't know
if you noticed or not

342
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:20,487
but Seltin didn't seem too happy
to see us leave together.

343
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:23,192
Well, she'd probably
prefer that I was...

344
00:19:23,233 --> 00:19:26,603
walking with Keshara or Renar.

345
00:19:27,608 --> 00:19:29,544
You see, ever since
my wife died

346
00:19:29,578 --> 00:19:32,071
everyone's been wondering
when I was going

347
00:19:32,184 --> 00:19:34,177
to find myself
another companion.

348
00:19:34,221 --> 00:19:35,689
Why haven't you?

349
00:19:35,725 --> 00:19:37,820
I guess I was waiting
for the right woman

350
00:19:37,862 --> 00:19:39,491
to fall out of the sky.

351
00:19:39,532 --> 00:19:42,129
That doesn't happen too often.

352
00:19:43,306 --> 00:19:46,039
It only had to happen once.

353
00:19:48,818 --> 00:19:50,788
Don't worry about Seltin.

354
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:54,022
After all, we both know

355
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:57,124
this is just a...
harmless little walk.

356
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:59,330
Absolutely.

357
00:20:01,175 --> 00:20:03,145
With a brief stop
to climb a tree.

358
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:04,340
Come on.

359
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,186
Don't tell me
in eight lifetimes

360
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:28,923
you've never climbed a tree?

361
00:20:28,964 --> 00:20:31,765
That's how I know
I'm afraid of heights.

362
00:20:31,803 --> 00:20:33,898
Well, don't worry.
I won't let you fall.

363
00:20:56,552 --> 00:21:00,083
This is one
of my favorite views.

364
00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:02,688
It's hard to believe

365
00:21:02,731 --> 00:21:04,860
that it all might
be gone in two weeks.

366
00:21:04,903 --> 00:21:07,339
I hope not.

367
00:21:07,374 --> 00:21:09,401
So do I.

368
00:21:17,427 --> 00:21:19,420
We better climb down.

369
00:21:51,796 --> 00:21:53,993
Oh, it's as beautiful
as you described.

370
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:55,697
I knew you'd like it.

371
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,119
Try one.

372
00:22:11,402 --> 00:22:12,893
Mmm! That's wonderful.

373
00:22:12,939 --> 00:22:14,932
I knew you'd like that, too.

374
00:22:14,976 --> 00:22:18,437
You know me pretty well
for someone who just met me.

375
00:22:18,483 --> 00:22:20,146
I'm glad you noticed.

376
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:35,947
I can't remember the last time
I did this...

377
00:22:35,985 --> 00:22:39,652
stroll through a garden,
climb a tree

378
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:43,426
eat fresh berries by a pond.

379
00:22:43,466 --> 00:22:45,959
What comes next?

380
00:22:56,927 --> 00:23:00,594
I think I'm starting
to remember.

381
00:23:13,563 --> 00:23:15,931
How are the
calculations coming?

382
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,995
I'm checking them now.

383
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:21,068
They're the same as before.

384
00:23:21,112 --> 00:23:23,309
There's nothing to indicate
the gamma bursts

385
00:23:23,349 --> 00:23:25,546
are causing
the quantum fluctuations.

386
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,453
Then something else

387
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:29,188
must be triggering
the dimensional shifts.

388
00:23:29,228 --> 00:23:31,927
Whatever it is, we'll find it.

389
00:23:33,937 --> 00:23:35,804
Sisko to Dax.

390
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,240
Go ahead, Commander.

391
00:23:37,277 --> 00:23:38,540
Good news.

392
00:23:38,579 --> 00:23:41,574
We've been able to get the probe
down another thousand kilometers

393
00:23:41,685 --> 00:23:43,153
into the sun's corona.

394
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:44,783
We picked up
some additional telemetry.

395
00:23:44,825 --> 00:23:45,850
I'll download it to you.

396
00:23:45,894 --> 00:23:46,884
Thank you, Chief.

397
00:23:47,898 --> 00:23:49,093
If all that fresh air
and sunshine

398
00:23:49,134 --> 00:23:50,694
start getting to you

399
00:23:50,737 --> 00:23:54,507
you're welcome to come
back up here to the <i>Defiant.</i>

400
00:23:54,545 --> 00:23:57,483
We're managing just fine.

401
00:23:57,517 --> 00:23:58,951
I'm sure you are.

402
00:23:58,987 --> 00:24:00,387
Sisko out.

403
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:04,456
Don't you want to take a look
at the new telemetry?

404
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,002
I'd rather sit here
and look at you.

405
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:10,567
How about this?

406
00:24:10,643 --> 00:24:13,171
We work for a few more hours

407
00:24:13,216 --> 00:24:15,482
and then we go back
to your room

408
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,786
and count each other's spots.

409
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:20,021
Oh, can I go first?

410
00:24:20,063 --> 00:24:21,497
We'll see.

411
00:24:28,412 --> 00:24:31,714
Take a look at the fusion
reactants in the core.

412
00:24:31,752 --> 00:24:34,485
They're out of balance.

413
00:24:34,524 --> 00:24:37,052
That's right, and the
imbalance is building

414
00:24:37,097 --> 00:24:40,001
toward a cascade reaction
on the quantum level.

415
00:24:42,007 --> 00:24:44,638
That's what's triggering
the dimensional shifts.

416
00:24:44,678 --> 00:24:46,648
And if we can stabilize
that reaction...

417
00:24:46,682 --> 00:24:48,150
We can keep
Meridian here longer.

418
00:24:48,185 --> 00:24:49,346
Oh, Jadzia!

419
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:51,658
I've got to get this

420
00:24:51,692 --> 00:24:53,355
to Commander Sisko
and Chief O'Brien.

421
00:24:55,533 --> 00:24:57,696
And then we can count
each other's spots.

422
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:08,321
These security protocols
look fine, Odo.

423
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,384
Just let me know...

424
00:25:09,428 --> 00:25:11,489
Odo, move out of there.

425
00:25:11,532 --> 00:25:14,163
You're ruining my shot.

426
00:25:14,204 --> 00:25:15,833
Odo...

427
00:25:15,873 --> 00:25:17,502
Oh, uh, Major...

428
00:25:17,544 --> 00:25:19,275
uh, why is Quark

429
00:25:19,314 --> 00:25:23,448
trying to take
a holo-picture of you?

430
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:28,864
Looks to me like he's
pointing at both of us.

431
00:25:28,899 --> 00:25:32,498
True, but every time
I stand in front of you

432
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,737
he seems to get very upset.

433
00:25:36,115 --> 00:25:37,310
Where are you going?

434
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:41,355
Uh-oh.

435
00:25:43,062 --> 00:25:44,895
What do you think
you're doing, Quark?

436
00:25:44,931 --> 00:25:45,956
- Nothing.
- Hah!

437
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,902
Then what's this?

438
00:25:47,937 --> 00:25:50,032
Oh, you mean this holo-imager.

439
00:25:50,076 --> 00:25:51,841
I was just recording
an image of the Promenade

440
00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:52,869
to send home to my mother.

441
00:25:52,914 --> 00:25:54,007
Hah!

442
00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:56,110
You're trying to take
a holoscan of me

443
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:57,453
and I want to know why.

444
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,651
Of you? Not at all.

445
00:25:58,692 --> 00:26:01,060
You just happened
to get in the frame.

446
00:26:01,098 --> 00:26:02,066
Hah!

447
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,466
Will you stop doing that?

448
00:26:03,502 --> 00:26:05,563
Not until you start
telling the truth.

449
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:06,596
You want the truth?

450
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,680
I'll tell you the truth.

451
00:26:09,781 --> 00:26:13,151
I was trying to get
an image of you

452
00:26:13,189 --> 00:26:15,318
for a special holosuite program
I'm designing.

453
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:16,691
Oh, I can just imagine

454
00:26:16,762 --> 00:26:18,857
what kind of program
that would be.

455
00:26:18,899 --> 00:26:21,165
I'm sure you can,
but you'd be mistaken.

456
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:24,336
The fact is,
I'm working on a simulation

457
00:26:24,377 --> 00:26:27,042
of the station's
Operations Center.

458
00:26:27,082 --> 00:26:28,573
People want to know
what goes on up there

459
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:30,646
and they want
to imagine themselves

460
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,523
fending off a Cardassian attack

461
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,295
or facing a fleet
of Jem'Hadar ships.

462
00:26:36,335 --> 00:26:38,430
Naked, I assume.

463
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:41,342
Isn't there some petty thief
you can harass?

464
00:26:41,378 --> 00:26:43,075
Just you.

465
00:26:44,951 --> 00:26:46,351
What do you say, Major?

466
00:26:46,388 --> 00:26:47,583
Give the public what they want.

467
00:26:47,624 --> 00:26:48,649
They're not asking for much...

468
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:50,321
just the chance to work
side by side with you.

469
00:26:50,363 --> 00:26:52,560
Oh, they want to work with me?

470
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,766
Well, then let them apply
to the Bajoran Military Academy.

471
00:26:55,806 --> 00:26:59,769
That way, I can be sure everyone
in Ops is wearing their uniform.

472
00:26:59,881 --> 00:27:01,441
Is that a no?

473
00:27:01,485 --> 00:27:03,352
Well, let me put it
another way...

474
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:06,452
if I ever catch you pointing
a holo-imager at me again

475
00:27:06,495 --> 00:27:08,362
you will end up eating it.

476
00:27:12,307 --> 00:27:14,641
Definitely a no.

477
00:27:26,969 --> 00:27:28,460
Jadzia.

478
00:27:28,505 --> 00:27:30,498
I've been looking for you.

479
00:27:36,153 --> 00:27:37,587
You found me.

480
00:27:37,624 --> 00:27:38,922
I have.

481
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:42,454
Good news... it's going to work.

482
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,299
We'll be able
to equalize the time

483
00:27:44,337 --> 00:27:45,635
between dimensional shifts.

484
00:27:45,673 --> 00:27:47,666
Oh, Jadzia, that's wonderful.

485
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:50,672
Do you know
what I'm going to do?

486
00:27:51,852 --> 00:27:55,485
I'm going to build a house
right here.

487
00:27:55,526 --> 00:27:56,619
Nothing extravagant.

488
00:27:56,662 --> 00:27:59,759
Just big enough for two.

489
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:01,269
Deral, I...

490
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,331
I know what you're thinking.

491
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:05,436
You're thinking
this man that just met me

492
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:08,076
is talking about
building a home for us.

493
00:28:08,117 --> 00:28:12,114
I realize you have
a life on Deep Space 9

494
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,131
but now, you'll have
a place here as well...

495
00:28:15,165 --> 00:28:16,964
for when you visit.

496
00:28:17,002 --> 00:28:19,165
I won't be able
to visit for a while.

497
00:28:19,207 --> 00:28:20,539
It's going to take a long time

498
00:28:20,576 --> 00:28:22,409
to stabilize the sun's
cascade reaction.

499
00:28:22,447 --> 00:28:23,642
How long?

500
00:28:23,682 --> 00:28:26,175
Meridian is going
to shift in five days.

501
00:28:30,362 --> 00:28:32,025
Jadzia...

502
00:28:34,537 --> 00:28:36,632
We'll see each other again.

503
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:38,143
In 60 years.

504
00:28:38,177 --> 00:28:40,511
I want you with me now.

505
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:44,250
That's what I want, too,
but there's nothing we can do.

506
00:28:45,292 --> 00:28:46,852
Yes, there is.

507
00:28:46,895 --> 00:28:48,797
I can leave Meridian

508
00:28:48,832 --> 00:28:51,064
and go back
to the Alpha Quadrant with you.

509
00:28:52,573 --> 00:28:54,041
If you'll have me.

510
00:28:54,076 --> 00:28:56,069
What do you think?

511
00:29:02,693 --> 00:29:05,256
Deral!
We've been looking for you.

512
00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:07,428
Commander Sisko told us
the great news.

513
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,804
I can't thank you enough
for all you've done.

514
00:29:09,841 --> 00:29:11,606
I'm glad we were able to help.

515
00:29:11,645 --> 00:29:13,740
The next time
Meridian returns here

516
00:29:13,782 --> 00:29:15,513
we'll have 30 years

517
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:17,546
for our people to get
to know each other better.

518
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:20,426
I need to discuss
something with you.

519
00:29:20,462 --> 00:29:21,862
Of course.
I've called a meeting.

520
00:29:21,898 --> 00:29:23,298
Now that we have a future again

521
00:29:23,335 --> 00:29:24,964
we need to start
planning for it.

522
00:29:25,004 --> 00:29:28,499
And you need to make
some decisions as well.

523
00:29:28,545 --> 00:29:30,276
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

524
00:29:30,316 --> 00:29:33,447
The person you need
to talk to is Keshara.

525
00:29:33,488 --> 00:29:35,788
She's not going to wait
for you forever, you know.

526
00:29:35,826 --> 00:29:38,160
I was going to speak
to her as well.

527
00:29:38,197 --> 00:29:39,165
I'm glad.

528
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:40,793
Think of it, Deral...

529
00:29:40,836 --> 00:29:43,569
people can start
having families again.

530
00:29:43,609 --> 00:29:46,911
Eventually, we may have
to expand the settlement.

531
00:29:46,948 --> 00:29:48,815
As you can see, Jadzia

532
00:29:48,852 --> 00:29:51,220
we have a great deal
of planning to do.

533
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:53,523
Well, I think
I've kept the others

534
00:29:53,562 --> 00:29:54,928
waiting long enough.

535
00:29:54,964 --> 00:29:56,091
Come, let's get started.

536
00:29:56,133 --> 00:29:57,932
You'd better go inside.

537
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:00,167
I'll meet you back at the ship.

538
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:13,981
You know, the person
I feel sorry for is Quark.

539
00:30:15,192 --> 00:30:18,358
He always thought that you
and he were made for each other.

540
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,198
I don't suppose
he'll be letting you

541
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:21,636
win at <i>tongo</i> anymore.

542
00:30:21,672 --> 00:30:23,106
What are you talking about?

543
00:30:23,142 --> 00:30:24,337
He doesn't let me win.

544
00:30:25,347 --> 00:30:26,645
Come in.

545
00:30:26,682 --> 00:30:28,345
Deral.

546
00:30:29,355 --> 00:30:31,018
Well, it's done.

547
00:30:31,057 --> 00:30:33,323
I told Seltin and the others
that I'm leaving Meridian.

548
00:30:33,363 --> 00:30:35,799
Oh, what did they say?

549
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,362
They asked me not to go.

550
00:30:38,406 --> 00:30:41,937
Seltin feels the settlement
can't afford to lose anyone.

551
00:30:41,979 --> 00:30:43,608
What did you tell her?

552
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:46,213
I told her I understood
her concern

553
00:30:46,254 --> 00:30:48,588
but that I've made up my mind.

554
00:30:50,262 --> 00:30:53,132
So, what were you two talking
about before I interrupted?

555
00:30:53,168 --> 00:30:54,193
Not me, I hope.

556
00:30:54,237 --> 00:30:56,571
Well, actually,
I was just telling Jadzia

557
00:30:56,609 --> 00:30:59,706
that, uh, not as good a <i>tongo</i>
player as she thinks she is.

558
00:30:59,748 --> 00:31:01,182
<i>Tongo?</i>

559
00:31:01,218 --> 00:31:03,781
It's a game,
and I'm very good at it.

560
00:31:03,823 --> 00:31:06,157
Well, we'll find out
on Tuesday night.

561
00:31:06,194 --> 00:31:07,857
And I want you there
to see for yourself.

562
00:31:07,898 --> 00:31:10,597
I'm going to clean you
and Quark out.

563
00:31:10,637 --> 00:31:12,630
Jadzia, I have to go.

564
00:31:12,674 --> 00:31:13,835
But you just got here.

565
00:31:13,877 --> 00:31:15,106
There are some things

566
00:31:15,145 --> 00:31:17,411
I need to take care of
before we leave Meridian.

567
00:31:17,451 --> 00:31:20,048
Do you need any help?

568
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:21,523
No, I...

569
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:24,497
I just have to say
good-bye to some people.

570
00:31:24,531 --> 00:31:27,628
I'll see you later tonight.

571
00:31:40,797 --> 00:31:43,394
Tiron, I was just
thinking about you.

572
00:31:43,436 --> 00:31:46,602
And I was thinking about you,
and your reputation

573
00:31:46,642 --> 00:31:48,509
as a man who can get
anything for a price.

574
00:31:48,546 --> 00:31:49,980
Stop. You're embarrassing me.

575
00:31:50,015 --> 00:31:52,953
I'll embarrass you even more
if you don't get me my program.

576
00:31:57,631 --> 00:31:59,533
Not to worry.

577
00:31:59,568 --> 00:32:01,094
Is that it?

578
00:32:01,137 --> 00:32:02,400
No.

579
00:32:02,441 --> 00:32:04,343
It's a high-level
decryption protocol.

580
00:32:04,377 --> 00:32:06,643
And I'm using it to get
the final information

581
00:32:06,682 --> 00:32:07,945
I need for your program.

582
00:32:07,985 --> 00:32:09,453
It cost me dearly.

583
00:32:09,488 --> 00:32:12,187
If it works, it's worth
whatever price you paid for it.

584
00:32:12,226 --> 00:32:13,820
I was hoping you'd say that.

585
00:32:13,863 --> 00:32:15,161
I'll put it on your bill.

586
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:17,727
Fine. Just get me my program.

587
00:32:17,804 --> 00:32:19,033
I'm leaving in two days.

588
00:32:19,073 --> 00:32:22,273
You'll have it, and I assure you
it'll be well worth the wait.

589
00:32:22,313 --> 00:32:24,146
I'll stake my reputation on it.

590
00:32:24,183 --> 00:32:25,743
You already have.

591
00:32:33,503 --> 00:32:35,132
Now...

592
00:32:35,172 --> 00:32:39,010
where to begin, hmm?

593
00:32:53,075 --> 00:32:54,635
You wanted to see me?

594
00:32:54,678 --> 00:32:56,146
Yes.

595
00:32:56,181 --> 00:32:59,017
Someone has been
illegally accessing

596
00:32:59,053 --> 00:33:03,426
the station's personnel files...
your file, to be exact.

597
00:33:03,462 --> 00:33:04,430
Mine?

598
00:33:04,464 --> 00:33:05,489
They've downloaded

599
00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:08,733
your voice print,
your retinal scan

600
00:33:08,773 --> 00:33:10,436
even your psychiatric profile.

601
00:33:10,476 --> 00:33:14,541
I've managed to trace the data
path back to its source.

602
00:33:14,585 --> 00:33:16,145
Well, let me guess... Quark.

603
00:33:16,187 --> 00:33:19,216
Was there any doubt?

604
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,230
Oh, with all this information

605
00:33:21,264 --> 00:33:24,759
he'd have no problem generating
a holo-image of me.

606
00:33:24,805 --> 00:33:28,905
So, shall I arrest him or would
you prefer to do it yourself?

607
00:33:30,349 --> 00:33:33,150
No, I have a better idea.

608
00:33:33,188 --> 00:33:35,215
Can you spare a few hours?

609
00:33:35,259 --> 00:33:38,960
I'd like to prepare
a little surprise for Quark.

610
00:33:41,204 --> 00:33:43,674
You see, the key
to <i>tongo</i> is to confront

611
00:33:43,709 --> 00:33:46,545
when you're sure
you're in a better position

612
00:33:46,582 --> 00:33:48,381
than the other players.

613
00:33:48,418 --> 00:33:51,288
And if your cards
match the roll of the dice

614
00:33:51,324 --> 00:33:53,487
then you win.

615
00:33:53,528 --> 00:33:55,498
Deral...

616
00:33:55,532 --> 00:33:58,663
Go on, I'm listening.

617
00:33:58,706 --> 00:34:02,201
You haven't heard a word
I've been saying, have you?

618
00:34:02,246 --> 00:34:03,806
I'm sorry.

619
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:06,683
I just have so much on my mind.

620
00:34:08,191 --> 00:34:10,684
You don't want to leave
Meridian, do you?

621
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:13,566
I said I would and I will.

622
00:34:13,603 --> 00:34:16,769
I know what you said,
but what do you want?

623
00:34:21,551 --> 00:34:23,282
To be with you.

624
00:34:23,321 --> 00:34:26,259
But you're worried
about your people.

625
00:34:28,265 --> 00:34:30,758
There are so few of us, Jadzia

626
00:34:30,803 --> 00:34:34,903
and now that Meridian has
a future again, they need me.

627
00:34:36,915 --> 00:34:39,751
Then you have to stay.

628
00:34:39,788 --> 00:34:41,314
And lose you?

629
00:34:41,357 --> 00:34:43,885
No.

630
00:34:43,996 --> 00:34:47,162
What if you didn't
have to lose me?

631
00:34:47,202 --> 00:34:50,038
What if I stayed here with you?

632
00:34:50,075 --> 00:34:53,343
I wish you could,
but that's not possible.

633
00:34:53,381 --> 00:34:55,010
Your molecular structure

634
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:56,578
wouldn't survive
the dimensional shift.

635
00:34:56,622 --> 00:34:58,558
We could use
a transporter buffer

636
00:34:58,591 --> 00:35:00,788
to match my quantum matrix
to yours.

637
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,068
But how do you know
that's possible?

638
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:06,198
Because I discussed
it with Julian

639
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,869
after you left my quarters.

640
00:35:07,944 --> 00:35:10,073
Jadzia...

641
00:35:10,115 --> 00:35:13,816
are you sure
you're willing to do that?

642
00:35:13,856 --> 00:35:16,019
It's the only way
we can be together

643
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,292
and I don't want
to lose you either.

644
00:35:37,144 --> 00:35:38,442
Come in.

645
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,215
Benjamin, I was just
finishing up my request

646
00:35:42,288 --> 00:35:44,155
to Starfleet
for my leave of absence.

647
00:35:44,192 --> 00:35:45,626
I bet this is the first time

648
00:35:45,662 --> 00:35:48,862
anyone has requested
a 60-year leave.

649
00:35:48,902 --> 00:35:51,567
You'll be sure
that it gets to them?

650
00:35:56,049 --> 00:36:01,185
If you're sure that this
is what you really want.

651
00:36:03,731 --> 00:36:05,199
What I really want

652
00:36:05,267 --> 00:36:08,239
is for you to say
that you're happy for me.

653
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:15,019
I guess I just need to know

654
00:36:15,054 --> 00:36:17,320
that you have thought
this thing through.

655
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:19,055
If Curzon had told me

656
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:21,361
he wanted to go off
with some woman he just met

657
00:36:21,399 --> 00:36:24,530
I would have tried
to talk him out of it, too.

658
00:36:24,572 --> 00:36:26,063
And you would have been right.

659
00:36:26,109 --> 00:36:29,640
He fell in love with someone new
every other week.

660
00:36:29,682 --> 00:36:32,118
But I'm not Curzon.

661
00:36:32,154 --> 00:36:34,921
No...

662
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,989
and I've never seen
Jadzia do anything

663
00:36:38,033 --> 00:36:40,800
without thinking it through
first.

664
00:36:43,978 --> 00:36:47,884
I am happy for you.

665
00:36:47,919 --> 00:36:49,889
It's just...

666
00:36:49,923 --> 00:36:52,223
I'm going to miss you, old man.

667
00:36:56,169 --> 00:37:02,136
You've been my friend
for two lifetimes.

668
00:37:02,181 --> 00:37:05,153
I can't imagine what
it's going to be like

669
00:37:05,187 --> 00:37:07,020
not having you around.

670
00:37:09,362 --> 00:37:12,493
And leaving Deep Space 9

671
00:37:12,535 --> 00:37:16,737
is the hardest thing
I have ever done

672
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:19,374
but I know it's right.

673
00:37:21,219 --> 00:37:25,717
Besides, after eight
lifetimes as a humanoid

674
00:37:25,762 --> 00:37:31,103
existing as pure consciousness
might be interesting.

675
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,879
Next time we see each other

676
00:37:38,921 --> 00:37:41,153
I'll probably be
a great-grandfather.

677
00:37:43,096 --> 00:37:47,332
Good. Then I can
call you "old man."

678
00:37:47,438 --> 00:37:49,874
I'll look forward to it.

679
00:38:06,543 --> 00:38:10,038
Now, I believe we agreed
I'd be paid on delivery.

680
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:12,553
I haven't seen
the merchandise yet.

681
00:38:12,588 --> 00:38:14,056
You know, Quark

682
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:17,291
if this program is
as good as you claim

683
00:38:17,331 --> 00:38:21,328
I might just purchase it
from you to use at home.

684
00:38:21,439 --> 00:38:25,072
You have your own holosuite?

685
00:38:25,113 --> 00:38:28,780
Just a little present
I bought myself.

686
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:33,558
His very own holosuite.

687
00:38:33,597 --> 00:38:35,260
Hmm.

688
00:38:36,269 --> 00:38:38,762
It's good to have money.

689
00:39:28,273 --> 00:39:31,609
I've been waiting for you.

690
00:39:39,829 --> 00:39:41,161
Quark!

691
00:39:44,138 --> 00:39:46,574
I will ruin you for this, Quark!

692
00:39:46,609 --> 00:39:48,875
You mean you didn't
like the program?

693
00:39:48,914 --> 00:39:52,318
I don't know how,
I don't know when

694
00:39:52,354 --> 00:39:54,654
but I will ruin you.

695
00:39:56,596 --> 00:39:58,064
Wait!

696
00:39:58,099 --> 00:39:59,590
What about my money?

697
00:39:59,635 --> 00:40:02,003
Another satisfied customer,
Quark?

698
00:40:08,186 --> 00:40:09,815
How do you feel?

699
00:40:09,855 --> 00:40:12,486
Pretty good, considering
I spent six hours

700
00:40:12,528 --> 00:40:15,694
having my molecules scrambled
in the transporter.

701
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,341
I, um...

702
00:40:23,383 --> 00:40:25,478
I don't know what to say.

703
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,513
That's a first.

704
00:40:29,695 --> 00:40:31,324
According to Deral's
calculations

705
00:40:31,365 --> 00:40:32,799
the dimensional shift
should occur

706
00:40:32,835 --> 00:40:34,737
within the next 47 minutes.

707
00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:38,743
Do you think you'll be done
overhauling the station

708
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,043
by the next time I see you?

709
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:42,919
I doubt it.

710
00:40:49,368 --> 00:40:51,531
Tell Quark I'll be back
to collect

711
00:40:51,572 --> 00:40:54,339
the three strips
of gold latinum he owes me

712
00:40:54,378 --> 00:40:56,211
with 60 years' interest.

713
00:40:58,219 --> 00:41:00,052
Energize.

714
00:41:09,241 --> 00:41:11,872
I was beginning to think
you were having second thoughts.

715
00:41:11,913 --> 00:41:13,815
No, just saying good-bye.

716
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,148
You missed Last Meal.

717
00:41:15,187 --> 00:41:17,521
I saved you some of these.

718
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,460
Thank you.

719
00:41:19,495 --> 00:41:22,126
Jadzia, I just
wanted you to know

720
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:24,399
how happy we are you've
decided to join us.

721
00:41:24,438 --> 00:41:25,428
Thank you.

722
00:41:25,473 --> 00:41:27,807
Everyone's beginning to gather.

723
00:41:27,844 --> 00:41:29,176
It's almost time.

724
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:35,080
Is there anything I need
to do to prepare?

725
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:38,360
Not that I can think of.

726
00:41:38,399 --> 00:41:41,803
What if I just hold onto you?

727
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,834
After all, we're not
going to be together again

728
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:46,711
like this for a long time

729
00:41:46,749 --> 00:41:49,585
and... I was just
getting used to this.

730
00:41:49,622 --> 00:41:53,221
We'll still be together,
Jadzia...

731
00:41:53,263 --> 00:41:56,326
in a way you can't even imagine.

732
00:42:09,188 --> 00:42:11,158
There she goes.

733
00:42:11,192 --> 00:42:13,355
Good-bye, Jadzia.

734
00:42:24,385 --> 00:42:26,048
Something's wrong.

735
00:42:28,393 --> 00:42:30,386
Commander, I'm reading
intense seismic activity

736
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:31,728
throughout the planet's crust.

737
00:42:31,766 --> 00:42:35,227
It better shift soon or it's
going to tear itself apart.

738
00:42:51,004 --> 00:42:52,267
Jadzia.

739
00:43:06,034 --> 00:43:07,970
I'm picking up
some kind of singularity

740
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:09,496
in the planet's quantum matrix.

741
00:43:09,542 --> 00:43:11,171
It's interfering
with the dimensional shift.

742
00:43:11,212 --> 00:43:14,616
It's functioning
almost like an anchor.

743
00:43:14,652 --> 00:43:16,178
Commander, it's Dax.

744
00:43:16,222 --> 00:43:19,319
Her presence there
is destabilizing the matrix.

745
00:43:19,361 --> 00:43:20,955
Sisko to Dax.

746
00:43:24,505 --> 00:43:26,702
Get her out of there, Chief.

747
00:44:00,009 --> 00:44:02,810
I thought you'd like to know
that Meridian shifted normally

748
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,511
once we beamed you away.

749
00:44:04,552 --> 00:44:07,251
Ah... good.

750
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:09,090
Jadzia...

751
00:44:09,127 --> 00:44:10,960
I'm sorry.

752
00:44:10,997 --> 00:44:12,899
Benjamin, don't.

753
00:44:12,935 --> 00:44:14,768
There's nothing you can do.

754
00:44:14,805 --> 00:44:17,037
Uh, I just need some time.

755
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,900
Just 60 years or so.
