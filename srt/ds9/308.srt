1
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:15,933
Too hot?

2
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,560
A little.
Ah.

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,689
Why don't you specify
a lower temperature?

4
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,359
No, no, no, no.
Coffee should be a little
too hot to drink right away.

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,361
Why?

6
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:30,405
It, uh, slows down
the experience,

7
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,325
gives you time
to savor the taste.

8
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:36,620
Ah, yes...
taste.

9
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,289
Odo, I know you don't

10
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:42,960
need to eat, but did you
ever try it anyway?

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,464
Once.

12
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,217
Not long after I was
first able to assume

13
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,260
the humanoid form.

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,137
And?

15
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:59,100
And since I don't
have taste buds,

16
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,938
it was very
unsatisfying...

17
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:05,524
not to mention messy.

18
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:07,651
Messy?!

19
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,737
I'd rather not
talk about it.

20
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:11,906
MALE:
Major Kira.

21
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:15,868
How nice to see you again.
Tiron.

22
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,828
You left Quark's last
night, just when

23
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:19,580
I was about to buy
everyone another round.

24
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,666
I was devastated
that you didn't say good-bye

25
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,711
and we were having such
a pleasant conversation.

26
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:29,214
As I recall, you were the one
doing all the talking.

27
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:32,426
Well, in that case,
you have me at a disadvantage.

28
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,930
You know all about me and I
know next to nothing about you.

29
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,182
Uh... perhaps I
should be going.

30
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,184
Oh, no. Stay.

31
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,978
This is Tiron,

32
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:45,272
a business associate
of Quark's.

33
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,942
This is Odo...

34
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:49,777
my lover.

35
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,698
Well...

36
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,243
you're a very lucky man.

37
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,205
I'm a lucky woman.

38
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:06,668
Yes... we're both very lucky.

39
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:12,340
And you make a most...
interesting couple.

40
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:17,096
So, Mr. Odo,
what is it that you do?

41
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:19,890
I'm Chief of Security
on this station.

42
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,391
Oh.

43
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,268
A station this size,

44
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,105
it must be
a very challenging job.

45
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:28,941
I hope you're well compensated.

46
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:31,068
Oh, money doesn't matter.

47
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,694
All we need is each other.

48
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,195
Isn't that right...

49
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,031
sweetheart?

50
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,616
Yes...

51
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:40,160
sweetheart.

52
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,662
KIRA:
You see,

53
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,914
money isn't everything.

54
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:48,794
Oh, no,
but it can buy everything.

55
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:52,339
Well, I'm afraid
I must be going.

56
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,008
Good-bye.

57
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,390
Oh, good riddance.

58
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,143
Thank you, Odo.

59
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:07,437
Wish you'd been
around last night.

60
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,272
I better get back to Ops.

61
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,566
See you later,
sweetheart.

62
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:22,243
<i>Commander's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 48423.2.</i>

63
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,788
<i>Despite the continuing threat</i>
<i>posed by the Dominion,</i>

64
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:27,499
<i>I've convinced Starfleet</i>
<i>that we must continue</i>

65
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,417
<i>our exploration</i>
<i>of the Gamma Quadrant.</i>

66
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,839
I've run a preliminary
analysis of our sensor sweeps

67
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,549
and the second planet
in the Kylata system

68
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,591
is definitely M-Class.

69
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,218
DAX:
I wish we'd had time

70
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,220
to beam down to the surface
and take a closer look.

71
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,472
Yeah, but I'd hate
to have run into
a Jem'Hadar patrol

72
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,974
while we were down
there picking flowers.

73
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,559
SISKO:
Fortunately,
there's no sign

74
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,019
of any Dominion activity
in this sector.

75
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,229
And let's hope
it stays that way.

76
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,357
I'm picking up very unusual
gravimetric distortions

77
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,441
in the Trialus system.

78
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,902
Any idea what's
causing them?

79
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,444
It's hard to tell
at this range.

80
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,946
Let's take
a closer look.

81
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,080
The system's coming
into visual range.

82
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,706
On screen.

83
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,585
The gravimetric distortions
are intensifying,

84
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,128
but they don't
seem to be coming

85
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,880
from the star itself.

86
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,631
But where else
could they be coming from?

87
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,425
There aren't any planets
in this system.

88
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:21,053
(<i> deep rumbling</i> )

89
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,018
There are now.

90
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,305
The planet seems to have settled
into a stable orbit.

91
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,890
But where did
it come from?

92
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,351
Could the entire planet
have been cloaked?

93
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,978
O'BRIEN:
If it was, there should be
residual ionization traces

94
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,437
but I'm not reading any.

95
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,065
Commander, we're being scanned.

96
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,359
The beam is coming
from a settlement

97
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:42,277
on the southern hemisphere.

98
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,655
I'm reading approximately
30 humanoid inhabitants.

99
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,615
They seem to be the only
humanoids on the planet.

100
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,825
They're hailing us.

101
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,535
Open a channel.

102
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,459
I'm Commander Benjamin Sisko
of the Federation Starbase

103
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,254
Deep Space 9.

104
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:02,839
I am Seltin Rakal of Meridian.

105
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,134
We were studying the star system
when your planet appeared.

106
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:10,638
I expect it must have come
as something of a surprise.

107
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,391
Well, you could say that.

108
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,393
It seemed to come
out of nowhere.

109
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,728
Not nowhere, Commander,

110
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:20,274
but from a dimension
that intersects with this one.

111
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,317
I could explain

112
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,819
more in detail,
if you're interested.

113
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,239
We were just about
to sit down for First Meal.

114
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,907
Why don't you join us?

115
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,369
We'd like that.

116
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,787
I just need to know

117
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,414
your planet is not
going to disappear

118
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:36,415
in the middle of dessert.

119
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,126
Don't worry.

120
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,128
We'll be here for a while.

121
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,220
(<i> laughter and conversation</i> )

122
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:55,267
(<i> playing quiet chiming melody)</i>

123
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,602
RAKAL:
It's good to be together

124
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,521
around this table again
after so long.

125
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,942
What's more,
we're fortunate to have visitors

126
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,278
to share First Meal with us.

127
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:12,159
I was admiring...
your markings.

128
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,037
Are they decorative?

129
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,706
No. Are yours?

130
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,501
No.

131
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,712
If you don't mind
my asking...

132
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:28,091
how far down
do they go?

133
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,551
All the way.

134
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:31,970
Ah.

135
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,849
You're not
eating, Commander.

136
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,977
I guess my curiosity is
bigger than my appetite.

137
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,146
I hope we can
satisfy both.

138
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,897
Hmm.

139
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:46,651
Well, you were saying
Meridian emerged

140
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,236
from a dimension that
intersects with this one?

141
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,779
Yes.

142
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:53,074
You see, our planet
has a dual existence.

143
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,536
It shifts between this
dimension and another.

144
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,122
What causes
these shifts?

145
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,665
Well, we're not
entirely sure.

146
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,001
Deral has been studying
the phenomenon.

147
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:06,087
With only limited
success, I'm afraid.

148
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:09,216
My theory is that the
dimensional shifts are caused

149
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,885
by fluctuations in
Meridian's quantum matrix--

150
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,221
fluctuations that are somehow
triggered by our own sun.

151
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,223
What's it like,
this dimension of yours?

152
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,599
It's hard
to explain.

153
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,977
It's... without form.

154
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,771
We exist as pure
consciousness.

155
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,690
And Meridian?

156
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,193
It becomes
noncorporeal as well,

157
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,945
but when we return
to this dimension,

158
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,281
everything is just
as we left it--

159
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,493
the buildings, the
trees, even our bodies.

160
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,079
Are you saying
that when you return here,

161
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,164
it's as if no time has passed?

162
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:44,042
We only age when we're
in corporeal form.

163
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,877
Sounds like this
other dimension

164
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,462
has its advantages.

165
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,339
DERAL:
Yes...

166
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,841
but we always look
forward to this existence

167
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,510
and its many pleasures.

168
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,098
Oh, here, let me
help you with that.

169
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,725
The trick is to
scoop out the pulp

170
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:04,438
and eat the thin layer
inside the rind.

171
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,356
Here, try some.

172
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,405
It's delicious.

173
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:14,781
Especially
if you've been

174
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,533
looking forward to it
for 60 years.

175
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,910
60 years?
Mm-hmm.

176
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,289
Huh. That's a long time
between meals.

177
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,380
(<i> buzz of conversation</i> )

178
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,765
A glass
of Andorian ale.

179
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,309
Done so soon?

180
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,227
You were barely
in the holosuite ten minutes.

181
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,605
There was no reason for me
to stay the full hour.

182
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,231
I understand.

183
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:52,277
It's a very...
<i>effective</i> program.

184
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,112
On the contrary,
I found it to be

185
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:57,865
quite dull-- boring,
boring, boring!

186
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,075
I'm sorry to hear

187
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,910
you say that, but
if you're asking

188
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,370
for a refund, forget it.

189
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,123
The contract specifically
says that satisfaction

190
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,542
is<i> not</i> guaranteed.

191
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:12,839
But... for a valued customer
such as yourself,

192
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,341
I'll make an exception,

193
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,511
and allow you to try
a different program...

194
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:20,054
no extra charge.

195
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,682
Let's see.

196
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:27,979
Something
a little bit more...

197
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,481
unique?

198
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:33,485
Oh, I have just the thing--

199
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,487
"A picnic with
the Pleasure Goddess of Rixx."

200
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:38,156
I can even provide real food,
for a small fee, of course.

201
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:42,827
I don't like picnics, Quark,
and the food here is abominable.

202
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,871
Forget the food.

203
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,457
Believe me, you've never
had a picnic like this one.

204
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:52,920
What I want
is not in your catalog.

205
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,132
Well, tell me what it is
and I'll order it for you.

206
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,593
It may take some time,
but, if it exists, I'll get it.

207
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:01,179
That's just the point, Quark.

208
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,764
The program I want
doesn't exist.

209
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,350
Not yet, anyway.

210
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,103
A custom program...

211
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,689
it'll be expensive.

212
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:25,286
Oh, for that kind of money,
you can move into a holosuite.

213
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,414
Now, what is it you want?

214
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,998
I want...

215
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,668
Major Kira.

216
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,253
Kir...

217
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,339
What are you going to do
with Kira in a holosuite?

218
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,967
No... don't tell me.

219
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,178
I don't want to know.

220
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,514
Can you do it?
It isn't going to be easy.

221
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,183
I'll have to get her
into the holosuite

222
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,436
and record her image,
and she hates holosuites.

223
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,187
Spare me the details.

224
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:54,524
Do we have a deal or do I
take my business elsewhere?

225
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,154
Consider it done.

226
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,699
Now, I'll just keep this...

227
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:07,662
Payment on delivery
and not a moment sooner.

228
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,375
Don't disappoint me, Quark.

229
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:17,380
When I walk into that holosuite
and I see Kira standing there...

230
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:22,302
I'd better believe
it's really her.

231
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,180
Leave it to me.

232
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,518
Mm-hmm.

233
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,442
The things I do for money.

234
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,614
Just beyond that forest,

235
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,949
there's a garden
with a small pond.

236
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,825
It sounds lovely.

237
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,454
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
It is.

238
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,038
Deral, our scans show
that there are

239
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,124
only about 30 of you
on this entire planet.

240
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,460
Well, there were
never many of us.

241
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,128
We're the descendants
of an expedition

242
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,380
that was stranded here
millennia ago.

243
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,924
And your population hasn't
increased since then?

244
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,259
It did for a time,

245
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,720
but over the last
few centuries,

246
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,846
our numbers have dwindled.

247
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:11,850
You see, we only reproduce
when we're in humanoid form,

248
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:16,063
and our time here
keeps growing shorter.

249
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:21,235
In 12 days, Meridian will shift
back to its noncorporeal state.

250
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:25,782
And remain there
for the next 60 years.

251
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:29,744
Eventually, we will only be here
for a matter of minutes.

252
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:33,414
When that happens,
Meridian will be too unstable

253
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:36,459
to successfully shift back
to the other dimension.

254
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,547
And then what happens?

255
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,716
The planet
and all its inhabitants

256
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,759
will cease to exist...

257
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,470
in either dimension.

258
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:02,026
We deeply appreciate
your offer of help, Commander.

259
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,529
If there is a way to stabilize
the dimensional shifts,

260
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,155
we'll do everything
we can to find it.

261
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,990
That's all
we can ask.

262
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,034
Aha. Here you go.

263
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,619
Do you want to play
<i>vajhaq</i> with us?

264
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,996
Maybe later.

265
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,713
Deral and I are beaming
up to the<i> Defiant.</i>

266
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:24,131
We're going to run a series
of helio-seismic scans

267
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,592
on the Meridian sun.

268
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,927
I'll join you.

269
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,470
Good luck.

270
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,614
Dabo!

271
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,786
Quark.

272
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:55,037
I got a message that Morn
wanted to see me.

273
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,832
I'm afraid you
just missed him.

274
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,500
Really?

275
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,668
So soon?

276
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,837
Would you come
with me, please?

277
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,882
Listen up, everyone.

278
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,509
I have wonderful news.

279
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,803
It's my pleasure
to announce

280
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,763
that my one-millionth
customer

281
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,306
just walked
through the door.

282
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,308
And here she is,
ladies and gentlemen,

283
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,602
Major Kira Nerys.

284
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,772
Quark! I don't
have time for this.

285
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:24,024
Why don't you make him
your one-millionth
customer?

286
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,903
But, Major, that
would be dishonest.
That never stopped you before.

287
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,029
But this is
a special occasion.

288
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,658
An event like this only happens
once in a bar owner's lifetime.

289
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:32,867
Let me tell you
about your prizes.

290
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,287
You mean, I won something?

291
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:37,664
Of course, you won something.

292
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,833
It's part of the celebration.

293
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,335
I never won anything before.

294
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,838
Well, now you have.
Congratulations.

295
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,881
Are you really
serious about this?

296
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,091
My customers are
my livelihood, Major.

297
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,385
This is a chance for me
to give something
back to them.

298
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,806
Now, let's see
what we have for you.

299
00:16:54,806 --> 00:17:00,019
A bottle of Kandora champagne,
vintage 2368--

300
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,771
that's a very good year.

301
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:06,609
These are good for five
free spins at the dabo wheel.

302
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,402
And last but not least,

303
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,572
one free hour in a holosuite
with the program of your choice.

304
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,449
Wait... a visit
to a holosuite?

305
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,784
Offer good today only.

306
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,369
But that's perfect.
Right this way.

307
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,204
It's Ensign
Quintana's birthday.

308
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,247
He'd love a free visit
to the holosuite.

309
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:23,543
But, Major, what about you?

310
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,836
Oh, you know
how I feel

311
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,212
about the
holosuites, Quark,

312
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:29,340
but, uh... thanks
for the champagne.

313
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,758
(<i> chuckles</i> )

314
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,188
These are the<i> Defiant's</i>
sensor readings

315
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,773
when we first
entered the system.

316
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,734
Take a look
at the spectral scan.

317
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,027
It indicates
that your sun

318
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:51,029
was giving off
modulated gamma bursts

319
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,822
right before Meridian
appeared.

320
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,949
My people have no record
of that phenomenon.

321
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,159
That's not surprising,
since Meridian was

322
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,579
in a noncorporeal state
when it occurred.

323
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,331
Gamma activity
would seem to indicate

324
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,834
an anomaly
in your sun's fusion cycle.

325
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,502
Let's find
out for sure.

326
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,170
Chief, I want you
to send a probe

327
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,256
into the sun's corona
to scan the core.

328
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,675
It'll take a minute
to modify the shield
configuration.

329
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:18,097
How do modulated gamma bursts
cause a dimensional shift?

330
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,434
Do you always do that

331
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,895
when you're
concentrating?

332
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:26,022
Do what?

333
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,148
Bite your lower lip.

334
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,570
I guess I do.

335
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,614
Probe's ready,
Commander.

336
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,825
Target it to these
coordinates and launch.

337
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,584
Shields are holding.

338
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,422
It's going to be a while

339
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:54,383
before the probe starts
sending back any telemetry.

340
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,595
Well, I'm sure you have
things you need to do.

341
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,683
Not really.

342
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,269
What a coincidence.

343
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,772
Neither do I.

344
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,024
DERAL:
This isn't turning out
exactly the way I planned.

345
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,400
DAX:
What do you mean?

346
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,027
You've barely
spoken a word

347
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,403
since we left
the settlement.

348
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,322
I don't know if you
noticed or not,

349
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,949
but Seltin didn't
seem too happy

350
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:19,492
to see us
leave together.

351
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,911
Well, she'd probably
prefer that I was...

352
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,956
walking with
Keshara or Renar.

353
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,959
You see, ever since
my wife died,

354
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:30,044
everyone's
been wondering

355
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,253
when I was going
to find myself

356
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,630
another companion.

357
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,173
Why haven't you?

358
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,425
I guess I was waiting
for the right woman

359
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,969
to fall out of the sky.

360
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:40,596
That doesn't
happen too often.

361
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,475
It only had to happen once.

362
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,355
Don't worry about Seltin.

363
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:52,566
After all, we both know

364
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,569
this is just a...
harmless little walk.

365
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,822
Absolutely.

366
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,575
With a brief stop
to climb a tree.

367
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,827
Come on.

368
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,599
Don't tell me
in eight lifetimes,

369
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,309
you've never
climbed a tree?

370
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,188
That's how I know
I'm afraid of heights.

371
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,272
Well, don't worry.
I won't let you fall.

372
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,757
This is one of
my favorite views.

373
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:03,179
It's hard to believe
that it all might
be gone in two weeks.

374
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,806
I hope not.

375
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,892
So do I.

376
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:17,568
(<i> gasps</i> )
We better climb down.

377
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:52,519
Oh, it's as beautiful
as you described.

378
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,272
I knew you'd like it.

379
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,533
Try one.

380
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,330
Mmm! That's wonderful.

381
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,540
I knew you'd
like that, too.

382
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,251
You know me pretty well

383
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,836
for someone
who just met me.

384
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,545
I'm glad you noticed.

385
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:34,394
I can't remember the
last time I did this--

386
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:38,065
stroll through
a garden, climb a tree,

387
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:41,861
eat fresh berries
by a pond.

388
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:44,280
What comes next?

389
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:59,045
I think I'm starting
to remember.

390
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:14,476
How are the
calculations coming?

391
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,520
I'm checking them now.

392
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,648
They're the same
as before.

393
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,942
There's nothing to indicate
the gamma bursts

394
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,028
are causing
the quantum fluctuations.

395
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:26,030
Then something else

396
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,656
must be triggering
the dimensional shifts.

397
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,243
Whatever it is,
we'll find it.

398
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,330
SISKO:
Sisko to Dax.

399
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,581
Go ahead, Commander.

400
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,541
Good news.

401
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,044
We've been able to get the probe
down another thousand kilometers

402
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:41,628
into the sun's corona.

403
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,256
We picked up
some additional telemetry.

404
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:44,340
I'll download it to you.

405
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,674
Thank you, Chief.

406
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,634
If all that fresh air
and sunshine

407
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,887
start getting to you

408
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:53,349
you're welcome to come
back up here to the<i> Defiant.</i>

409
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:56,352
We're managing just fine.

410
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:57,728
I'm sure you are.

411
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:58,938
Sisko out.

412
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,234
Don't you want to take
a look at the new telemetry?

413
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:07,071
I'd rather sit here
and look at you.

414
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,489
How about this?

415
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:12,201
We work for
a few more hours,

416
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:14,287
and then we go back
to your room

417
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,830
and count each
other's spots.

418
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,041
Oh, can I go first?

419
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,043
We'll see.

420
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:30,677
Take a look at the fusion
reactants in the core.

421
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,513
They're out of balance.

422
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:36,016
That's right, and the
imbalance is building

423
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,811
toward a cascade reaction
on the quantum level.

424
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,565
That's what's triggering
the dimensional shifts.

425
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,483
And if we can stabilize
that reaction...

426
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,361
We can keep
Meridian here longer.

427
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,447
Oh, Jadzia!

428
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:52,241
I've got to get this
to Commander Sisko
and Chief O'Brien.

429
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,662
And then we can count
each other's spots.

430
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:08,506
These security
protocols look fine, Odo.
Just let me know...

431
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:10,426
QUARK (<i> quietly</i> ):
Odo, move out of there.

432
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:13,053
You're ruining my shot.

433
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,888
Odo...

434
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,474
Oh, uh, Major...

435
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:18,309
uh, why is Quark

436
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:22,396
trying to take
a holo-picture of you?

437
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:27,860
Looks to me like he's
pointing at both of us.

438
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,322
True, but every time
I stand in front of you,

439
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:33,491
he seems to get
very upset.

440
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,202
QUARK:
Where are you going?

441
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:40,247
Uh-oh.

442
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,876
What do you think
you're doing, Quark?

443
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:44,960
Nothing.
Hah!

444
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,795
Then what's this?

445
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,964
Oh, you mean
this holo-imager.

446
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,632
I was just recording
an image of the Promenade

447
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,968
to send home
to my mother.
Hah!

448
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,179
You're trying to take
a holoscan of me,

449
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,305
and I want to know why.

450
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:57,555
Of you? Not at all.

451
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,641
You just happened
to get in the frame.

452
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,311
Hah!
Will you stop
doing that?

453
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,522
Not until you start
telling the truth.

454
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:05,605
You want the truth?

455
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,692
I'll tell you the truth.

456
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:12,154
I<i> was</i> trying to get
an image of you

457
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:14,198
for a special holosuite program
I'm designing.

458
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,699
Oh, I can just imagine

459
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,701
what kind of program
that would be.

460
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,120
I'm sure you can,
but you'd be mistaken.

461
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,374
The fact is,
I'm working on a simulation

462
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:26,001
of the station's
Operations Center.

463
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,669
People want to know
what goes on up there

464
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,505
and they want to
imagine themselves

465
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,549
fending off a
Cardassian attack

466
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:35,010
or facing a fleet
of Jem'Hadar ships.

467
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,012
Naked, I assume.

468
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:40,015
Isn't there some petty thief
you can harass?

469
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,434
Just you.

470
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:45,563
What do you say, Major?
Give the public what they want.

471
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:47,314
They're not asking for much--

472
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,941
just the chance to work
side by side with you.

473
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,193
Oh, they want to work with me?

474
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:54,488
Well, then let them apply
to the Bajoran Military Academy.

475
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:58,492
That way, I can be sure everyone
in Ops is wearing their uniform.

476
00:26:58,492 --> 00:26:59,993
Is that a no?

477
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,870
Well, let me put it
another way--

478
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,915
if I ever catch you pointing
a holo-imager at me again,

479
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:06,833
you will end up eating it.

480
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,295
(<i> clatters to ground</i> )

481
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,173
Definitely a no.

482
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,104
Jadzia.

483
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,981
I've been
looking for you.

484
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,071
You found me.

485
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,406
I have.

486
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:41,076
Good news--
it's going to work.

487
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,911
We'll be able
to equalize the time

488
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,204
between
dimensional shifts.

489
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:47,040
Oh, Jadzia,
that's wonderful.

490
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,169
Do you know what
I'm going to do?

491
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:53,880
I'm going to build a house
right here.

492
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,965
Nothing extravagant.

493
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:58,260
Just big enough
for two.

494
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,803
Deral, I...

495
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,888
I know what
you're thinking.

496
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,057
You're thinking this
man that just met me

497
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,602
is talking about
building a home for us.

498
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:10,606
I realize you have
a life on Deep Space 9,

499
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:13,733
but now, you'll have
a place here as well...

500
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,486
for when you visit.

501
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:17,737
I won't be able
to visit for a while.

502
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,198
It's going to take
a long time

503
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:20,824
to stabilize the sun's
cascade reaction.

504
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,284
How long?

505
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,578
Meridian is going
to shift in five days.

506
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,376
Jadzia...

507
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,088
We'll see each other again.

508
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,756
In 60 years.

509
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:39,051
I want you with me now.

510
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:42,638
That's what I want, too,
but there's nothing we can do.

511
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,349
Yes, there is.

512
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:47,393
I can leave Meridian,

513
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:49,395
and go back to the
Alpha Quadrant with you.

514
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,565
If you'll have me.

515
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:54,608
What do you think?

516
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,443
(<i> both laughing</i> )

517
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,742
Deral! We've been
looking for you.

518
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,952
Commander Sisko told us
the great news.

519
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:08,247
I can't thank you enough
for all you've done.

520
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,082
I'm glad we were able to help.

521
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,042
The next time
Meridian returns here,

522
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:13,960
we'll have 30 years

523
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,129
for our people to get
to know each other better.

524
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,798
I need to discuss
something with you.

525
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,217
Of course. I've
called a meeting.

526
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:21,760
Now that we have
a future again,

527
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,303
we need to start
planning for it.

528
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:26,890
And you need to make
some decisions as well.

529
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,642
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

530
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:31,811
The person you need
to talk to is Keshara.

531
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:34,064
She's not going to wait
for you forever, you know.

532
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:36,525
I was going to speak
to her as well.

533
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:37,693
I'm glad.

534
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:39,069
Think of it, Deral--

535
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:42,114
people can start
having families again.

536
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,741
Eventually, we may have

537
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:45,242
to expand
the settlement.

538
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:47,035
As you can
see, Jadzia,

539
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,496
we have a great deal
of planning to do.

540
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,790
Well, I think I've
kept the others

541
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,208
waiting long enough.

542
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,460
Come, let's
get started.

543
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,211
You'd better go inside.

544
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,338
I'll meet you
back at the ship.

545
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:13,895
You know, the person
I feel sorry for is Quark.

546
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,982
He always thought that you
and he were made for each other.

547
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:20,235
I don't suppose
he'll be letting you
win at<i> tongo</i> anymore.

548
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,862
What are you talking about?
He doesn't let me win.

549
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:25,324
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Come in.

550
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:26,950
Deral.

551
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,620
Well, it's done.

552
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,913
I told Seltin and the others
that I'm leaving Meridian.

553
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,500
Oh, what did they say?

554
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,127
They asked me not to go.

555
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,254
Seltin feels the settlement
can't afford

556
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,673
to lose anyone.

557
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:42,132
What did you tell her?

558
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:44,926
I told her I understood
her concern,

559
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,970
but that I've
made up my mind.

560
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,432
So, what were you
two talking about

561
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,643
before I interrupted?
Not me, I hope.

562
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:55,312
Well, actually,
I was just telling Jadzia

563
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:58,357
that, uh, not as good a<i> tongo</i>
player as she thinks she is.

564
00:30:58,357 --> 00:30:59,858
<i>Tongo?</i>

565
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,444
It's a game,
and I'm very good at it.

566
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,946
Well, we'll find out
on Tuesday night.

567
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,532
And I want you there
to see for yourself.

568
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:09,201
I'm going to clean you
and Quark out.

569
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:12,371
Jadzia, I have to go.
But you just got here.

570
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:16,041
There are some things
I need to take care of
before we leave Meridian.

571
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,585
Do you need any help?

572
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,128
No, I...

573
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,964
I just have to say
good-bye to some people.

574
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:26,051
I'll see you
later tonight.

575
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,941
Tiron, I was just
thinking about you.

576
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,610
And I was thinking
about you

577
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,195
and your reputation

578
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:47,030
as a man who can get
anything for a price.

579
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,615
Stop. You're
embarrassing me.

580
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,075
I'll embarrass
you even more

581
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,077
if you don't get me
my program.

582
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,124
Not to worry.

583
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,585
Is that it?

584
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:01,127
No.

585
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,962
It's a high-level
decryption protocol.

586
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,298
And I'm using it to get
the final information

587
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,260
I need for your program.
It cost me dearly.

588
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,846
If it works, it's worth
whatever price you paid for it.

589
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,389
I was hoping
you'd say that.

590
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:13,932
I'll put it
on your bill.

591
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,435
Fine. Just get me
my program.

592
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:17,686
I'm leaving in two days.

593
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:19,062
You'll have it,
and I assure you

594
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,939
it'll be well
worth the wait.

595
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,691
I'll stake my
reputation on it.

596
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,192
You already have.

597
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,869
Now...

598
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:37,497
where to begin, hmm?

599
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,221
You wanted to see me?

600
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,807
ODO:
Yes.

601
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:57,559
Someone has been
illegally accessing

602
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,103
the station's
personnel files--

603
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,939
<i>your</i> file, to be exact.

604
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:02,981
Mine?

605
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,316
They've downloaded

606
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:07,319
your voice print,
your retinal scan,

607
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,195
even your psychiatric
profile.

608
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:13,158
I've managed to trace the data
path back to its source.

609
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,910
Well, let me guess-- Quark.

610
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,996
Was there any doubt?

611
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,915
Oh, with all this information,

612
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:23,627
he'd have no problem generating
a holo-image of me.

613
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:27,380
So, shall I arrest him or would
you prefer to do it yourself?

614
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:31,885
No, I have a better idea.

615
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,846
Can you spare a few hours?

616
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:37,432
I'd like to prepare
a little surprise for Quark.

617
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:43,062
You see, the key
to<i> tongo</i> is to confront

618
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,607
when you're sure you're
in a better position

619
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,150
than the other players.

620
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,820
And if your cards match
the roll of the dice,

621
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,071
then you win.

622
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,991
Deral...

623
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:57,410
Go on, I'm listening.

624
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,622
You haven't heard a word
I've been saying, have you?

625
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,415
I'm sorry.

626
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:05,377
I just have so much
on my mind.

627
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:09,339
You don't want to leave
Meridian, do you?

628
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:12,425
I said I would and I will.

629
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,928
I know what you said,
but what do you want?

630
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:16,221
(<i> sighs</i> )

631
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,935
To be with you.

632
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:24,813
But you're worried
about your people.

633
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:29,651
There are
so few of us, Jadzia,

634
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:33,363
and now that Meridian has
a future again, they need me.

635
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:38,410
Then you have to stay.

636
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,870
And lose you?

637
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,581
No.

638
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:45,876
What if you didn't
have to lose me?

639
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:48,670
What if I stayed
here with you?

640
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,882
I wish you could,
but that's not possible.

641
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:53,633
Your molecular structure

642
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,301
wouldn't survive
the dimensional shift.

643
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,262
We could use a
transporter buffer

644
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,431
to match my quantum
matrix to yours.

645
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:02,642
But how do you know
that's possible?

646
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,978
Because I discussed
it with Julian

647
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,646
after you left my quarters.

648
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,774
Jadzia...

649
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:12,360
are you sure you're
willing to do that?

650
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,613
It's the only way
we can be together,

651
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,865
and I don't want
to lose you either.

652
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:36,259
(<i> door chimes</i> )

653
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,803
Come in.

654
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:41,640
Benjamin, I was just
finishing up my request

655
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,516
to Starfleet
for my leave of absence.

656
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,851
I bet this is
the first time

657
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:48,021
anyone has requested
a 60-year leave.

658
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:50,816
You'll be sure that
it gets to them?

659
00:35:55,278 --> 00:36:00,325
If you're sure that this
is what you really want.

660
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:04,537
What I really want

661
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,457
is for you to say that
you're happy for me.

662
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,297
I guess I just need to know

663
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,508
that you have thought
this thing through.

664
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,343
If Curzon had told me

665
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:20,720
he wanted to go off
with some woman he just met,

666
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,765
I would have tried
to talk him out of it, too.

667
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,433
And you would have been right.

668
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,019
He fell in love
with someone new

669
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:28,854
every other week.

670
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:31,230
But I'm not Curzon.

671
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,109
No...

672
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:37,236
and I've never seen
Jadzia do anything

673
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,865
without thinking it
through first.

674
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:47,164
I<i> am</i> happy for you.

675
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:49,166
It's just...

676
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,376
I'm going to miss you, old man.

677
00:36:55,338 --> 00:37:01,302
You've been my friend
for two lifetimes.

678
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:04,556
I can't imagine what
it's going to be like

679
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,183
not having you around.

680
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,980
And leaving Deep Space 9

681
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,984
is the hardest thing
I have ever done,

682
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:18,611
but I know it's right.

683
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:24,910
Besides, after eight
lifetimes as a humanoid,

684
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:28,121
existing as
pure consciousness

685
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:30,248
might be interesting.

686
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:38,131
Next time
we see each other,

687
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:40,550
I'll probably be
a great-grandfather.

688
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,385
(<i> laughing</i> )

689
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:46,806
Good. Then I can
call<i> you</i> "old man."

690
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,934
I'll look forward to it.

691
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:09,370
Now, I believe we agreed
I'd be paid on delivery.

692
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,790
I haven't seen
the merchandise yet.

693
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,332
You know, Quark,

694
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:16,711
<i>if</i> this program is
as good as you claim,

695
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:20,840
I might just purchase it
from you to use at home.

696
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,343
You have your
own holosuite?

697
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:28,098
Just a little present
I bought myself.

698
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,769
His very own holosuite.

699
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:34,437
Hmm.

700
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:38,066
It's good to have money.

701
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:30,869
I've been waiting for you.

702
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:40,295
Quark!

703
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,424
I will ruin you
for this, Quark!

704
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:48,220
You mean you didn't
like the program?

705
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,723
I don't know how,
I don't know when,

706
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,892
but I<i> will</i> ruin you.

707
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,354
Wait!

708
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:58,563
What about my money?

709
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,606
Another satisfied
customer, Quark?

710
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,823
How do you feel?

711
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,409
Pretty good, considering
I spent six hours

712
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,453
having my molecules scrambled
in the transporter.

713
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,170
I, um...

714
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,130
I don't know
what to say.

715
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,216
That's a first.

716
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,095
According to Deral's
calculations,

717
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:31,512
the dimensional shift
should occur

718
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,472
within the next 47 minutes.

719
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,475
Do you think
you'll be done

720
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,852
overhauling
the station

721
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,812
by the next time
I see you?

722
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:42,023
I doubt it.

723
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:50,365
Tell Quark I'll
be back to collect

724
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:53,159
the three strips
of gold latinum he owes me,

725
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,203
with 60 years' interest.

726
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,831
Energize.

727
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,217
I was beginning to think

728
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:10,676
you were having
second thoughts.

729
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,553
No, just saying good-bye.

730
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,888
You missed Last Meal.

731
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,224
I saved you
some of these.

732
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:18,268
Thank you.

733
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:21,062
Jadzia, I just
wanted you to know

734
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:23,064
how happy we are you've
decided to join us.

735
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:24,274
Thank you.

736
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:26,484
Everyone's beginning
to gather.

737
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,569
It's almost time.

738
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,783
Is there anything I need
to do to prepare?

739
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:37,245
Not that
I can think of.

740
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:40,706
What if I just hold onto you?

741
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:43,584
After all, we're not
going to be together again

742
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,628
like this for a long time,

743
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:48,340
and... I was just
getting used to this.

744
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,884
We'll still be
together, Jadzia...

745
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:54,929
in a way you
can't even imagine.

746
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:10,320
There she goes.

747
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,571
Good-bye, Jadzia.

748
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:25,168
Something's wrong.

749
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,755
Commander, I'm reading
intense seismic activity

750
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,632
throughout the planet's crust.

751
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:34,386
It better shift soon or it's
going to tear itself apart.

752
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:51,403
Jadzia.

753
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,252
I'm picking up
some kind of singularity

754
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:08,920
in the planet's
quantum matrix.

755
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,463
It's interfering
with the dimensional shift.

756
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:13,799
It's functioning
almost like an anchor.

757
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,468
Commander, it's Dax.

758
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:18,471
Her presence there is
destabilizing the matrix.

759
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,265
Sisko to Dax.

760
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:23,684
(<i> gasping</i> )

761
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,978
Get her out of there, Chief.

762
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:45,457
(<i> door chime</i> )

763
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,846
I thought you'd
like to know

764
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:02,474
that Meridian
shifted normally

765
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:04,225
once we beamed you away.

766
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,436
Ah... good.

767
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:08,438
Jadzia...

768
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:10,273
I'm sorry.

769
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:12,108
Benjamin, don't.

770
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:13,943
There's nothing
you can do.

771
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:16,154
Uh, I just need
some time.

772
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:30,585
Just 60 years or so.
