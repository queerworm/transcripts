1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,755
<i>Last time on</i>
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...

2
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:08,342
The Dominion won't attack Earth.

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:09,885
How can you be sure?

4
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:12,596
Because Earth isn't the key
to the Alpha Quadrant--

5
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:13,722
the wormhole is.

6
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,891
And whoever controls
Deep Space 9

7
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:17,768
controls the wormhole.

8
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:24,692
Target locked.

9
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:25,776
Fire!

10
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,032
Execute Rom?

11
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,327
He committed an act of terrorism
against the Dominion.

12
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,496
You've got to finish
what I started.

13
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:39,748
The fate
of the entire Alpha Quadrant

14
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,041
rests in your hands.

15
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,835
What happens if I get caught?

16
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,720
If those Dominion
reinforcements

17
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,846
come through
the wormhole

18
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:55,347
we'll have lost
everything.

19
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:56,849
Then we take
the ships we have

20
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:58,308
fight our way
to Deep Space 9

21
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,268
and destroy
the anti-graviton emitter.

22
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,687
It's our<i> only</i> hope.

23
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,856
Dukat is bringing
down the minefield,

24
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:06,025
the Federation is
about to be overrun

25
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:07,735
by the Dominion
reinforcements,

26
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:10,153
and Weyoun has ordered
Rom's execution.

27
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,488
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,658
We are way,<i> way</i> past "sorry."

29
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,745
O'BRIEN:
It's a large Dominion fleet.

30
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,120
1,254 ships.

31
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,873
They outnumber us two to one.

32
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:23,042
There's an old saying--

33
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:25,836
"Fortune favors the bold."

34
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,381
Well...

35
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:32,091
I guess we're about to find out.

36
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,099
<i>And now the conclusion.</i>

37
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:03,999
Sisko to all ships.

38
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,126
Cruiser and galaxy wings,
drop to half impulse.

39
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,086
You, too, Commander.

40
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:08,295
Half impulse.

41
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,089
GARAK:
I feel sorry
for the Klingons.

42
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:12,758
They're going to miss
a very interesting fight.

43
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,843
I have a feeling
we're going to miss them.

44
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,177
Forget the Klingons.

45
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,472
Our job is to get
to Deep Space 9

46
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,265
and prevent
the Dominion reinforcements

47
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,767
from coming through
the wormhole.

48
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,769
And that's
what we're going to do.

49
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:28,189
Attack-fighters,
tactical pattern theta.

50
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,525
Concentrate your fire
on the Cardassian ships

51
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,402
and then split off
into squadrons

52
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,821
and run like hell.

53
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,448
Why is he only targeting
the Cardassian ships?

54
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,199
He's hoping to get them
to break formation

55
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,327
so they'll go after
the Federation fighters.

56
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,703
He knows the Jem'Hadar

57
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,413
will stand their ground,
but the Cardassians

58
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,500
might just get angry enough
to take the bait.

59
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,836
Which would open a hole
we can punch through.

60
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,629
You're getting
quite an education.

61
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,923
Attack-fighters
in theta formation.

62
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,592
Cruiser and galaxy wings
at half impulse.

63
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,260
Sisko to attack-fighters.

64
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,386
Prepare to engage

65
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,346
on my command.

66
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,388
<i>Aye, sir.</i>

67
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,598
"Cannon to the right of them,

68
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,641
"Cannon to the left of them,

69
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,143
"Cannon in
front of them,

70
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:06,436
Volley'd and thunder'd..."

71
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,605
"Storm'd at with shot and shell

72
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,273
"Boldly they rode and well

73
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,443
"Into the jaws of Death,
Into the mouth of Hell

74
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,903
Rode the six hundred."

75
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,738
Whatever it is
you two are reciting,

76
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:17,990
I wish you'd stop.

77
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,825
Steady, Ensign.
It's just a poem.

78
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,536
It's not the poem
that's bothering me.

79
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,080
Stop worrying about those ships.

80
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,041
Focus on your work.

81
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,291
That's what I do.

82
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,293
You should listen to him,
Ensign.

83
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,587
He's a professional.

84
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,588
(<i> laughs</i> )

85
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,589
SISKO:
Attack-fighters

86
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,716
full impulse.

87
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:36,967
Fire at will.

88
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,641
They're not
taking the bait.

89
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,601
Ensign, send in
the second wave.

90
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,437
Tell them to keep targeting
the Cardassians.

91
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,023
Aye, sir.

92
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,274
Second wave on its way.

93
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,359
Third and fourth wave
on hot standby.

94
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:03,362
Mr. O'Brien, have
destroyer units 2 and 6

95
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,447
move in closer.

96
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,200
They need
more cover fire.

97
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,035
And tell Captains
Diego and Reynolds

98
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,161
to stay alert.

99
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,121
They may try to outflank us.

100
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,592
(<i> Dukat chuckling</i> )

101
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,845
It's a very clever strategy.

102
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:29,056
But then I'd expect
nothing less

103
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,389
from Captain Sisko.

104
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,313
The Captain is
a very clever man.

105
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:39,024
You<i> do</i> see it, don't you?

106
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,150
Of course I do.

107
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,027
Well, then,
perhaps you'd like

108
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,612
to explain
Captain Sisko's strategy

109
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,405
to the Founder yourself.

110
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:49,701
I could never hope
to match your eloquence.

111
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,161
True.

112
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:56,166
Sisko is trying
to provoke us

113
00:06:56,166 --> 00:07:00,295
into opening a hole
in our lines.

114
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,130
He's determined
to get here

115
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,133
and stop us from taking
down this minefield.

116
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,010
Now, I plan...

117
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,055
to give Sisko his opening...

118
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,807
and then...

119
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,435
close it on him.

120
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,437
What about the minefield?
Are we still on schedule?

121
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,190
We should be able
to detonate the mines

122
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,358
in eight hours.

123
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,026
Good.

124
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,820
Eight hours.

125
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,531
I'll hold you
to that, Dukat.

126
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,703
I'd like to toss
that smug little Vorta

127
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,996
out the nearest airlock.

128
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,039
(<i> laughs</i> )

129
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,540
And his Founder with him.

130
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,251
Now, now, Damar,

131
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:43,171
that's no way to talk
about our valued allies...

132
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:47,926
not until this war
is over anyway.

133
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,970
Sir, there is
one other thing.

134
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,221
Make it brief.

135
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,639
I'm concerned

136
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,766
about further attempts
to sabotage this station.

137
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:55,976
The enemy knows
if they don't act soon

138
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,185
it'll be too late.

139
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,562
By "enemy," I assume
you're referring

140
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,022
to Rom's associates.

141
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,482
I doubt whether
he was working alone

142
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,025
when he tried
to sabotage this station.

143
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,360
He must've had help.

144
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,903
His wife Leeta...

145
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,529
Jake Sisko...

146
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,656
Major Kira.

147
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,241
What are you proposing?

148
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,618
That we arrest them
and keep them in custody

149
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,787
at least until
the wormhole is reopened.

150
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,332
It's a wise precaution.

151
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,583
But our Bajoran allies

152
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,378
might object to an
arrest without cause.

153
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,298
If anyone asks,

154
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:31,094
we are merely holding them
for questioning, hmm?

155
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,637
And, Damar,

156
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:36,099
make sure they're
not harmed in any way.

157
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,770
Major Kira is important
to my daughter.

158
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,939
And to me.

159
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,108
Sir, about your daughter...

160
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:48,611
perhaps it would be better,
for her own sake

161
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,739
if Ziyal were confined
to quarters.

162
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,991
For what reason?

163
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,118
To be perfectly honest, sir

164
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,496
I don't completely trust her.

165
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,414
And neither should you.

166
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:07,339
Are you accusing
my daughter of
being a saboteur?

167
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,924
I'm not accusing her
of anything.

168
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:13,387
But she is... quite friendly
with Major Kira.

169
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:16,306
That will be all, Damar.

170
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,350
She doesn't appreciate
what it means to be Cardassian

171
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,642
or to be your daughter.

172
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,896
But she<i> is</i> my daughter.

173
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,315
That may mean
nothing to you

174
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,859
but it means
everything to me.

175
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,872
I heard the Federation
fleet has been ambushed.

176
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,874
I heard two
Cardassian soldiers

177
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,626
saying the fleet was
completely destroyed.

178
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,795
Don't believe
everything you hear.

179
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,424
Jake's right.

180
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,426
Sisko will get here.

181
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:53,552
The question is:

182
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,636
Will he get here
soon enough?

183
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,556
He's only got
seven hours

184
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:58,890
before they detonate
the minefield

185
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,434
and start bringing
the reinforcements

186
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,976
through the wormhole.

187
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,978
We've got to stop them.

188
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,439
How?

189
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,024
What if we cut off
the power supply

190
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,484
to the main computer?

191
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:12,070
Shut down the
whole station.

192
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,488
Oh, great.

193
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,740
That would put me out
of business altogether.

194
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,534
Well, it would
also keep them

195
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,202
from detonating
the mines.

196
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,580
Okay...

197
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,583
so we shut down
the main computer.

198
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,042
How?

199
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,627
A bomb.

200
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,920
A bomb?!

201
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,632
(<i> softly</i> ):
What kind of bomb?

202
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,675
Leave that to me.

203
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,928
It'll be crude,
but effective.

204
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,598
The main computer
is in the Central Core.

205
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:42,350
It's too heavily guarded.

206
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,270
You'll never be able

207
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,021
to smuggle a bomb
into there.

208
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,610
I'll plant the bomb.

209
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,488
All we need to do
is distract the guards.

210
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,281
DAMAR:
In here.
Secure the door.

211
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,492
(<i> footsteps approach</i> )

212
00:10:58,492 --> 00:10:59,826
Ah, Major, there you are.

213
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:00,952
How nice of you

214
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,370
to gather your
friends for us.

215
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,705
I'm off duty, Damar.
What do you want?

216
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,583
I want you to come with us,
all three of you.

217
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,626
Where?

218
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:09,377
To the Security Office.

219
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,088
We have to ask you
a few questions.

220
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,756
What kind
of questions?

221
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,634
You'll find out
when we get there.

222
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,473
DAMAR:
Go ahead, Major,
try something.

223
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,724
Nothing would make me happier.

224
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,854
Don't worry.
It'll be all right.

225
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,772
Of course it will.

226
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:33,109
You've nothing
to hide, do you?

227
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,532
You certainly don't.

228
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,717
I'll say this for Captain Sisko,
he is persistent.

229
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,887
That's the ninth wave
of Federation fighters

230
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,305
he's sent against us.

231
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:06,643
Well, his persistence
is about to pay off.

232
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:10,522
Let's give him
his reward, shall we?

233
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:13,400
Have a half dozen
squadrons break formation

234
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,943
and go after
those fighters.

235
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,487
Yes, sir.

236
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,455
O'BRIEN:
Two squadrons
of Cardassian attack ships

237
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,747
are breaking formation.

238
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,375
They're going
after our fighters.

239
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,335
GARAK:
They're taking the bait.

240
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:33,545
We've opened a hole
in their lines.

241
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:34,879
Have we?

242
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,090
Sir, do you see
those Galore-class destroyers?

243
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,132
SISKO:
I see them.

244
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,884
It's a trap.

245
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,845
It is also an opportunity
and we may not get another one.

246
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:47,726
Ensign, have Galaxy Wings 9-1
and 9-3 engage those destroyers.

247
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:50,395
All other ships,
head for that opening.

248
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,063
Anyone who gets through
doesn't stop

249
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,148
until they reach Deep Space 9.

250
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,592
Congratulations, Captain!

251
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:22,552
You wanted them angry,
they're angry.

252
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,137
The<i> Magellan</i> and the<i> Venture</i>

253
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,263
are supposed to be protecting
our starboard flanks.

254
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,765
They're in too tight.

255
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,975
Ensign, tell fighter
squadrons 6, 7 and 8 to--

256
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,144
Sir, I can't
get through to anybody.

257
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,270
Communications are down.

258
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,148
They're jamming our signal

259
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,567
by generating
a rotating EM pulse.

260
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:38,693
Can you clear it?

261
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,654
I'm trying.

262
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,789
War is such... thirsty work.

263
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:53,207
Don't you agree?

264
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,375
Perhaps if you didn't
talk so much

265
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,210
your throat wouldn't get so dry.

266
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,754
(<i> both laughing</i> )

267
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,131
Cardassians do like to talk.

268
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:04,093
I suppose it can be
a failing at times.

269
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,179
No.

270
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:09,474
To the conquerors
of the Federation.

271
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:10,933
(<i> clinks</i> )

272
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,437
Aren't you being
a bit premature?

273
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,731
I don't think so.

274
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:20,318
Not with 2800
Dominion ships

275
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,654
waiting to come
through that wormhole.

276
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,364
Well, those ships
aren't going to be here

277
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,240
for another five hours,
and need I remind you

278
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,992
a lot can happen
in that amount of time.

279
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,994
Oh...!

280
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,788
Tell me, Weyoun...

281
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,960
have you ever been diagnosed
as anhedonic?

282
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,338
You think I'm incapable
of experiencing joy

283
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,173
just because
I'm cautious?

284
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,133
We didn't defeat
the Federation

285
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,218
by being cautious.

286
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,969
We haven't defeated it yet,

287
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:50,515
and even if we do,
it's only the beginning.

288
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,767
Holding onto a prize
as vast as the Federation

289
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,352
isn't going to be easy.

290
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:57,772
It's going to require
an enormous number of ships,

291
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:00,817
a massive occupation army...

292
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:04,904
and constant vigilance.

293
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,700
I look<i> forward</i> to it.

294
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,829
I'm sure you also looked forward
to occupying Bajor

295
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,498
and we all know what
a disappointment that was.

296
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:16,791
Ah, ah, ah, ah...

297
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,669
On Bajor,
I merely implemented policy.

298
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,295
I didn't make it.

299
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:25,049
If I had, things would have
turned out quite differently.

300
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,635
If you ask me,

301
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:32,223
the key to holding
the Federation...

302
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:34,225
is Earth.

303
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,018
If there's going to be

304
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,020
an organized
resistance against us,

305
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,732
its birthplace
will be there.

306
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,692
You could be right.

307
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,694
Then our first step

308
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:48,406
is to eradicate
its population.

309
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,784
It's the only way.

310
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,493
You can't do that.

311
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,495
Why not?

312
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,330
Because!

313
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,833
A true victory

314
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,585
is to make your enemy see

315
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:04,046
they were wrong to oppose you
in the first place.

316
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:09,844
To<i> force</i> them...
to acknowledge your greatness.

317
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,596
Then you kill them?

318
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:15,725
Only if it's necessary.

319
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:21,063
I had no idea.

320
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,985
(<i> sighing</i> )

321
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,864
Perhaps the biggest
disappointment in my life

322
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:33,743
is that the Bajoran people
still refuse to appreciate

323
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:37,413
how lucky they were
to have me as their liberator.

324
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:41,208
I protected them
in so many ways...

325
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:45,129
cared for them
as if they were my own children.

326
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,798
But to this day

327
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:53,012
is there a single...
statue of me on Bajor?

328
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,806
I would guess not.

329
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,141
And you'd be right.

330
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,935
(<i> both chuckling</i> )

331
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:05,358
Take Captain Sisko--

332
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:10,070
an otherwise intelligent,
perceptive man, hmm?

333
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:18,830
Even he refuses to grant me
the respect I deserve.

334
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,373
(<i> chuckling</i> )

335
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,708
You find that amusing?

336
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,876
Not at all.

337
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,627
I find it...

338
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,005
(<i> chuckles</i> )

339
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,673
...fascinating.

340
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,132
Laugh all you want.

341
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:33,427
History will prove me right.

342
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,267
I have news, Odo.

343
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:44,063
Our battle with
the Federation
fleet is going well.

344
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,774
There are people
out there fighting...

345
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,067
dying...

346
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,987
people who used
to be my friends.

347
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,864
They're solids, Odo.

348
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:54,448
You must remember that.

349
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,745
I know, but they still
mean something to me.

350
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,663
The Link means more.

351
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:01,915
(<i> sighs</i> )

352
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:04,667
That's what I keep
telling myself,

353
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:08,004
but somehow I can't
quite believe it.

354
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:11,173
You asked me for clarity, Odo.

355
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,259
I gave it to you.

356
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,178
Now you must accept it.

357
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,139
It's Major Kira, isn't it?

358
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:23,143
You still have
strong feelings for her.

359
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,939
She doesn't deserve
your loyalty, Odo.

360
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:29,316
You cannot allow a solid
to deny you

361
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,277
your rightful place
in the Great Link.

362
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,654
I couldn't permit it.

363
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,490
What are you saying?

364
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,452
The Major has been arrested.

365
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,870
On what charge?

366
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,789
That hardly matters.

367
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,083
What matters is
she will be found guilty

368
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,209
and sentenced to death.

369
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,795
No.

370
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:52,006
Her death is
your salvation.

371
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,133
Link with me, Odo.

372
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,135
Embrace the clarity.

373
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,013
It is the only thing
that will give you peace.

374
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,641
No.

375
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,310
You cannot help her, Odo.

376
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,938
You cannot help
any of the solids

377
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:10,524
no matter how much
you may want to.

378
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,944
It's too late for them.

379
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,461
Sir, we've just lost
the<i> Sitak</i> and the<i> Majestic.</i>

380
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,629
We're on our own.

381
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,756
Com's back on line!

382
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,466
Four enemy ships directly ahead!

383
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:38,136
Evasive maneuvers...
pattern omega.

384
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,262
We're going through!

385
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,318
That's one down.

386
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,486
Can we shake the other three?

387
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:56,779
I'm trying.

388
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,160
We've lost aft shields.

389
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,203
Forward shields
are down to 15 percent.

390
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,330
Wouldn't this be
a good time to cloak?

391
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,290
The cloaking system's fried.

392
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,834
Auxiliary power to weapons.

393
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,418
We're going to fight
our way out of this.

394
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:28,602
It's the Klingons, sir.

395
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,854
They're here.

396
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,398
We're being hailed
by Commander Worf.

397
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,734
On screen.

398
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:35,776
WORF:
<i>Captain</i>

399
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,361
<i>I'm sorry we were late.</i>

400
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,530
<i>It was not easy</i>
<i>to convince Chancellor Gowron</i>

401
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,907
<i>to spare us any ships.</i>

402
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:43,283
I'm just glad you could
join us, Commander.

403
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,327
Captain, the Klingons
have broken a hole

404
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,453
in the Dominion lines.

405
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:47,997
Dax, can you get us through?

406
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,082
I'd love to try.

407
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:05,890
Any other ships make it?

408
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,600
No, sir.

409
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:12,479
We only have
three hours

410
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,565
before the minefields
are detonated.

411
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,734
Set a course
for Deep Space 9.

412
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,236
Maximum warp.

413
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,325
The<i> Defiant</i> has broken through
all our lines.

414
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,786
It's on its way here.

415
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,412
Shall I order a pursuit?

416
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,623
At once.

417
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:33,751
The<i> Defiant</i> is no match
for this station.

418
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:36,921
If Sisko wants
to commit suicide,

419
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,380
I say we let him.

420
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,353
Don't scream.

421
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,439
I won't hurt you.

422
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,741
I just have one question.

423
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,202
What's that?

424
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:11,872
Do you know how to make
<i>hasperat</i> soufflé?

425
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,960
(<i> door opening</i> )

426
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,463
Lunch for Major Kira.

427
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,299
Major Kira
has already been fed.

428
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:24,218
And I can only imagine
the slop you served her.

429
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,553
What I have here
is<i> hasperat</i> soufflé

430
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:27,554
just the way

431
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,889
the Major likes it.

432
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,225
This is a jail, not a hotel.

433
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:32,559
The Major will eat

434
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,478
what the other
prisoners eat.

435
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,855
Do you know who I am?

436
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,397
Gul Dukat's daughter.

437
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,816
That's right.

438
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:42,360
Now, I suggest you allow
us to deliver this food.

439
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,612
I can't do that.

440
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,448
However...

441
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,701
I will take the tray to her.

442
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,203
After I examine it.

443
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:54,414
Um... is that
really necessary?

444
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,708
Lift the lid.

445
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,127
If you insist.

446
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,133
You see?

447
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,093
<i>Hasperat</i> soufflé.

448
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,221
Just as I said.

449
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:16,979
Stop poking it.

450
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:19,732
It's very delicate.

451
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,741
Now you've ruined it.

452
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,253
How much longer before they
detonate the minefield?

453
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:42,171
I wish you'd stop
asking that.

454
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:44,590
Sorry.

455
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:48,426
I'd say about 90 minutes.

456
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,346
My time grows short.

457
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,681
Don't say that.

458
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,600
The only reason
they haven't killed me yet

459
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,852
is that I'm part
of their victory celebration.

460
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,021
7:00: Dukat makes a speech.

461
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:01,439
8:30: Cake and<i> raktajino.</i>

462
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:04,818
8:45: Execute the Ferengi.

463
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:05,945
QUARK:
All right--

464
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:06,987
no one move!

465
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,115
Brother!

466
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,699
I knew you would come.

467
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,868
It's a surprise to me.

468
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:16,122
Now, just keep
calm and stay

469
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,039
where you are.

470
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,165
Understand?
Don't move.

471
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:25,047
You...

472
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:27,174
open the holding cells.

473
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,219
I said

474
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,554
open the holding cells.

475
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,015
You just told them
<i>not</i> to move.

476
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,558
Right.

477
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,812
Nobody moves... except you.

478
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,105
Now...

479
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:44,150
open the cells.

480
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:49,822
(<i> yelling</i> )

481
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:57,495
Quark?

482
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,748
Yes?

483
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,084
Take down the force fields.

484
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,710
Force fields...

485
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,931
KIRA:
I'd kiss you, Quark,
but there isn't time.

486
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,933
We have to find a way
to shut down the power
to the main computer.

487
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:18,976
I can do that.

488
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:19,977
Oh, Rom.

489
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,603
That is, if we
can make it

490
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,189
to the Central Computer
Core without being killed.

491
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,231
Right.
Rom, you're with me.

492
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,523
The rest of you

493
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:26,984
find someplace to stay
out of sight.

494
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,027
Will do.

495
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:36,576
I know you're confused, Odo

496
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,329
but you don't have to be.

497
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:41,332
All the answers you
seek are in the Link.

498
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:43,667
(<i> door chimes</i> )

499
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:44,877
Come in.

500
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:50,174
Forgive the intrusion

501
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:53,593
but Major Kira,
the Ferengi saboteur,

502
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,679
and the rest of their
terrorist group have escaped

503
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,681
from the holding cells.

504
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,932
For your own protection,

505
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,600
I must ask you
to come with me.

506
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,936
I want them caught.

507
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,897
They will be.

508
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:08,150
But in the meantime,
you'll both be safer in Ops.

509
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,567
Very well.

510
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:16,658
Odo?

511
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,202
I'll be fine here.

512
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,788
You're sure?

513
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,749
Yes.

514
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,099
Get out of here!

515
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,079
Do you hear that?

516
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,582
That's Bajoran phaser fire.

517
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:10,337
Why would Dominion troops
be using Bajoran weapons?

518
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,340
(<i> body thuds to ground</i> )

519
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,425
(<i> phaser fire stops</i> )

520
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:34,403
Never underestimate
the element of surprise.

521
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:40,159
You have less
than 40 minutes

522
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,619
to shut down
the main computer.

523
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:42,702
I hope that's
enough time.

524
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,246
It'll have to be.

525
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:46,373
Can you keep the Dominion
patrols off our backs?

526
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,041
I'll head down to Security.

527
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,544
Create enough false alarms
to keep them occupied.

528
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:51,545
Any questions?

529
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:52,838
I could ask why?

530
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:56,133
I don't think there's time
to explain it.

531
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,802
Besides, I think
you know the answer.

532
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,184
What about the Link?

533
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:09,313
The Link... was paradise.

534
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:12,650
But it appears
I'm not ready for paradise.

535
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:16,612
Good luck.

536
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:17,737
You, too.

537
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,075
(<i> sighs</i> )

538
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:34,171
Dax, what's our ETA?

539
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,339
11 minutes.

540
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:36,465
That's cutting it close.

541
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:43,013
How's it going, Rom?

542
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:45,182
I wish you'd
stop asking that.

543
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:46,308
Sorry, sorry.

544
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:53,982
I'm not going to make it.

545
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:57,069
All right, then concentrate
on cutting off the power

546
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,571
to the station's
weapons array.

547
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:00,072
Without weapons

548
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,991
they won't be able
to detonate the minefield.

549
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,118
Not for a while anyway.

550
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,625
DAMAR:
Sir, the Klingons
have outflanked us.

551
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,836
Our lines are
beginning to crumble.

552
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,339
There's nothing
to worry about.

553
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,132
In exactly four minutes,

554
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,718
thousands of Dominion ships

555
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:23,095
will come pouring
through that wormhole.

556
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,805
I just hope the<i> Defiant</i>
gets here in time

557
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:26,932
for Sisko to see it.

558
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:31,895
Ben, if I were you

559
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,146
I'd start coming up
with a Plan "B."

560
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:37,651
Almost there.

561
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:40,987
I just need to decouple
the ODN relays.

562
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,616
The last mines have
been neutralized.

563
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,705
We're ready to detonate
the minefield, sir.

564
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,507
Fire!

565
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,092
Done.

566
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:08,307
Uh-oh.

567
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,851
What is it?

568
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,355
We were too late.

569
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,371
What do we do
now, Captain?

570
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,832
Take us into the wormhole.

571
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,083
O'BRIEN:
What the hell.

572
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,293
We're only going to meet

573
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:38,003
a couple of thousand
Dominion ships.

574
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,045
DAX:
One ship

575
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,213
against an entire fleet?

576
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,715
That's a hell of a Plan "B."

577
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,258
GARAK:
Chief,

578
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,926
how does that poem end?

579
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,805
You don't want to know.

580
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,310
Send a message

581
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,229
to our listening posts
in the Gamma Quadrant.

582
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,648
Tell the reinforcements

583
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:00,317
that the Alpha Quadrant
awaits them.

584
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:02,319
DAMAR:
Sir...

585
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,155
the<i> Defiant--</i>
it's heading for the wormhole.

586
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:06,615
Destroy it.

587
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:08,742
(<i> console beeping</i> )

588
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,078
What's wrong, Damar?

589
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,413
Our weapons...

590
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,249
they're off-line.

591
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,001
They've been
sabotaged.

592
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,545
How can that be?

593
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:22,589
Major Kira.

594
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,187
Full stop.

595
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:40,482
Chief, divert all power
to forward shields and weapons.

596
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,901
Captain, I'm reading
multiple warp signatures ahead.

597
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:43,902
On screen.

598
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,987
Maximum magnification.

599
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,289
Lock phasers.

600
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,624
Prepare to launch

601
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,501
quantum torpedoes.

602
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:10,763
Why have you brought me here?

603
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,892
Show yourselves.

604
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,104
What do you want?

605
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,317
The Sisko
has returned to us.

606
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,236
He arrives with questions.

607
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:28,196
There are always questions.

608
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:31,575
I didn't ask to come here.

609
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:34,661
You desire to end the game.

610
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,163
What game?

611
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,916
I don't understand.

612
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:42,836
You seek to shed
your corporeal existence.

613
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,421
That cannot be allowed.

614
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,632
The game must not end.

615
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:48,425
The game.

616
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:50,928
You mean my life.

617
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:52,596
Is that what this is about?

618
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:55,265
You don't want me to die?

619
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:58,226
The game must continue.

620
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,728
You are the Sisko.

621
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:04,399
Believe me, I don't want to die,
but I have to do

622
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,984
everything I can
to prevent the Dominion

623
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,445
from conquering
the Alpha Quadrant.

624
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:12,198
If that means sacrificing
my life and the life of my crew,

625
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,992
so be it.

626
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,494
We do not agree.

627
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,996
We find your
reasoning flawed.

628
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,957
Insufficient.

629
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:23,919
I'm flattered you feel that way,
but it doesn't change anything.

630
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,921
Now, send me back to my ship.

631
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:30,509
This isn't what I meant.

632
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,511
I want to return
to my reality.

633
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:36,055
You are the Sisko.

634
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:38,517
I am also
a Starfleet Captain.

635
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,644
I have a job to do
and I intend

636
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:41,687
to do it.

637
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:44,397
The Sisko is belligerent.

638
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,274
Aggressive.

639
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,026
Adversarial.

640
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,737
You're damn right
I'm adversarial.

641
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:53,448
You have no right
to interfere with my life.

642
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:56,326
We have every right.

643
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:57,953
Fine.

644
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,579
You want to interfere?

645
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,331
Then interfere.

646
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:04,543
Do something about
those Dominion reinforcements.

647
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:07,004
That is a
corporeal matter.

648
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:10,215
Corporeal matters
do not concern us.

649
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:11,884
The hell they don't.

650
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:14,177
What about Bajor?

651
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:17,055
You can't tell me
Bajor doesn't concern you.

652
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,559
You've sent the Bajorans
Orbs and Emissaries.

653
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,686
You've even encouraged them

654
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:25,146
to create
an entire religion around you.

655
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,900
You even told me once
that you were of Bajor.

656
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,359
So don't you tell me

657
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,862
you're not concerned
with corporeal matters.

658
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:34,907
I don't want
to see Bajor destroyed.

659
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:38,493
Neither do you,
but we all know

660
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,453
that's exactly
what's going to happen

661
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,915
if the Dominion takes over
the Alpha Quadrant.

662
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:46,043
You say you don't want me
to sacrifice my life.

663
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:47,335
Well, fine.

664
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,545
Neither do I.

665
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:50,881
You want to be Gods.

666
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:52,674
Then<i> be</i> Gods.

667
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:54,384
I need a miracle.

668
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,845
Bajor needs a miracle.

669
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:59,514
Stop those ships!

670
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,182
We are of Bajor.

671
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,476
But what
of the Sisko?

672
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,520
He is intrusive.

673
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,607
He tries to control the game.

674
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:11,610
A penance must
be exacted.

675
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,906
It is agreed.

676
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:19,492
The Sisko is of Bajor,
but he will find

677
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,620
no rest there.

678
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,962
His<i> pagh</i> will follow
another path.

679
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,673
What path is that?

680
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:37,970
O'BRIEN:
Phaser banks
fully charged.

681
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,888
NOG:
Forward shields
at 100 percent.

682
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,014
Torpedoes ready.

683
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,015
Targets locked.

684
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:43,642
Here they come.

685
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:46,436
Fire on my command.

686
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,234
NOG:
There must be thousands of them.

687
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,236
GARAK:
And half of them
have locked targets on us.

688
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,571
Steady, people.

689
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,365
Make every shot count.

690
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,702
Benjamin.

691
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:20,012
They've cloaked.

692
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:22,806
I'm not picking up
any neutrino emissions. 

693
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:25,517
Then... where did they go?

694
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,019
Wherever they went...

695
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:29,771
I don't think
they're coming back.

696
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,196
Sir, the wormhole
is opening.

697
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:43,368
The<i> Defiant.</i>

698
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:46,872
Our reinforcements
must be right behind.

699
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:52,377
No, sir.
There's no sign of them.

700
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:53,461
That's impossible.

701
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,505
Check our
listening posts

702
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:56,965
in the Gamma Quadrant.

703
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,591
They're not there, either.

704
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,677
But they entered
the wormhole.

705
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,554
Where are they?!

706
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,139
I don't know.

707
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,018
The<i> Defiant</i> has opened fire
on us!

708
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:09,561
Obviously.

709
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,479
Can you get our weapons
back on line?

710
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,939
Not for a while.

711
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,358
Sir, 200 enemy ships

712
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,402
have broken through our lines.

713
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,779
They're headed
this way.

714
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,656
Time to start packing.

715
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,909
FOUNDER:
Contact our forces
in the Alpha Quadrant.

716
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:27,495
Tell them to fall back
to the Cardassian territory.

717
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,663
It appears this war

718
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,249
is going to take
longer than expected.

719
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:35,087
We'll meet you
at Airlock Five.

720
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,592
DAMAR:
Sir?

721
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:44,179
Victory was within our grasp.

722
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:46,305
We have to evacuate
the station, sir!

723
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,265
Bajor...

724
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,767
the Federation...

725
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,811
the Alpha Quadrant...

726
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:52,979
all lost.

727
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,689
We have to go now, sir.

728
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,648
Go?

729
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:56,900
The Federation ships...

730
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,110
they'll be here soon.

731
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,112
We have to get back
to Cardassia.

732
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:01,863
I have to find
my daughter.

733
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,949
I'll send someone
for her!

734
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:06,659
That<i> won't</i> be necessary.

735
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,036
You're wasting your time!

736
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,914
Promenade!

737
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:13,792
She won't go with you!

738
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:17,336
Sir, the Dominion forces
are leaving the station.

739
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,504
Let them go.

740
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:20,465
We're in no shape
to stop them.

741
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:23,802
BASHIR:
Captain, we're getting
a message from the<i> Cortéz.</i>

742
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:26,138
The Dominion fleet
have broken off the fight.

743
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:27,680
They're in retreat.

744
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,308
Tell the<i> Cortéz</i> and
the rest of the fleet

745
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:34,146
to rendezvous
at Deep Space 9.

746
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,198
COMPUTER:
<i>All Dominion personnel</i>

747
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:49,327
<i>proceed to Airlocks 4, 7 and 12</i>
<i>for evacuation.</i>

748
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,370
<i>This is a first priority order.</i>

749
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,873
<i>Repeat, all Dominion personnel</i>

750
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:57,294
<i>proceed to Airlocks 4, 7 and 12</i>
<i>for evacuation.</i>

751
00:38:57,294 --> 00:38:59,212
WEYOUN:
Out of the way, out of the way.

752
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:00,880
Step aside.

753
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,634
Make way for the Founder.

754
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:07,012
What about Odo?
Is he coming with us?

755
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,722
No.

756
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,725
But he will
join us one day.

757
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,478
It's only a matter
of time.

758
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,116
Father!

759
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,328
Ah, Ziyal.

760
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,913
(<i> laughing</i> )

761
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,334
I've been
looking for you.

762
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:39,460
I heard about
the evacuation.

763
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,795
You're all I have...

764
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,755
all I care about.

765
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:45,508
No matter how much
I try to hate you,

766
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,968
I can't.

767
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:50,763
I couldn't live with myself
if you hated me.

768
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,807
Come.

769
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,893
We'll talk on the way home.

770
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,269
Home?

771
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,064
Cardassia.

772
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:00,982
We have to leave here, Ziyal,

773
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:03,151
before the Federation arrives.

774
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:05,028
I'm not leaving.

775
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:07,322
These people are our enemies.

776
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:09,199
They're not<i> my</i> enemies.

777
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,951
I'm one of them.

778
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,287
That's not true.

779
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:15,580
Father...

780
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,208
I helped Major Kira

781
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:21,460
and the others escape
from the holding cells.

782
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:27,050
Do you know
what you're saying?

783
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,344
Yes, I do.

784
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,598
I belong here.

785
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,065
Good-bye, Father.

786
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:49,072
(<i> crying</i> )

787
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,453
I love you.

788
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,206
(<i> gasps</i> )

789
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:00,541
No!

790
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,709
You heard her.

791
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:02,961
She's a traitor.

792
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:07,757
Ziyal, it's all right.

793
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,342
It's, it's all right.

794
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:10,593
It's all right.

795
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:13,721
Ziyal, I forgive you.
It's all right.

796
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,681
DAMAR:
We're out of time, sir.

797
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,225
The last ship
is waiting for us!

798
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:18,517
(<i> yells angrily</i> )

799
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:23,356
Ziyal, please hear me.

800
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:25,317
I love you.

801
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,654
I love you, Ziyal.

802
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:32,907
No. No!

803
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:42,375
(<i> whispers</i> ):
Ziyal...

804
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:53,470
(<i> crew cheering and clapping)</i>

805
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,393
Ah, Jake.

806
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:02,020
Welcome back, Captain.

807
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,063
Good to see you,
Constable.

808
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,358
It's good to see you all.

809
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:07,817
Captain...

810
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:09,402
it would appear

811
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:10,945
I owe you a barrel
of bloodwine.

812
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,364
We'll drink it
together.

813
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:14,240
Worf.

814
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,741
Jadzia.

815
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:18,119
I guess the
wedding's still on.

816
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,373
O'BRIEN:
Quark...

817
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:23,375
are the holosuites
still working?

818
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,460
Ready and waiting, Chief.

819
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,128
Julian, did you hear that?

820
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:29,755
The Battle of Britain--
I'll meet you there
in an hour.

821
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:30,798
You've been promoted?

822
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:31,841
I'm an engineer.

823
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:33,926
We'll be working
together.

824
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:36,595
Actually, you'll
be working for me.

825
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,391
JAKE:
Really missed you.

826
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:40,350
It's good to have
you back, Dad.

827
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,393
SISKO:
So...

828
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:42,685
where's Major Kira?

829
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:45,188
She's in the Infirmary...
with Ziyal.

830
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,037
She loved you.

831
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:05,958
I could never
figure out why.

832
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,005
I guess I never will.

833
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:17,345
We'll go back to Cardassia,
Ziyal.

834
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,267
We'll be safe there.

835
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,102
You'll live with me...

836
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:28,106
Maybe Dr. Bashir
can do something for him.

837
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:30,900
DUKAT:
We'll both be
very happy together.

838
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:35,154
I know you forgive me.

839
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:39,200
After all,
I am your father.

840
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,036
And I forgive you...

841
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,705
my precious girl.

842
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:45,915
Easy.

843
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,004
Easy now.

844
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:02,474
I forgive you, too.
