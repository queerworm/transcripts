1
00:00:03,267 --> 00:00:05,967
Last time on
<i>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...</i>

2
00:00:08,011 --> 00:00:09,640
The Dominion won't attack Earth.

3
00:00:09,682 --> 00:00:11,083
How can you be sure?

4
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,092
Because Earth isn't the key
to the Alpha Quadrant...

5
00:00:14,126 --> 00:00:15,185
the wormhole is.

6
00:00:15,295 --> 00:00:17,493
And whoever controls
Deep Space 9

7
00:00:17,534 --> 00:00:19,003
controls the wormhole.

8
00:00:25,553 --> 00:00:26,350
Target locked.

9
00:00:26,388 --> 00:00:27,014
Fire!

10
00:00:32,002 --> 00:00:33,369
Execute Rom?

11
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:36,709
He committed an act of terrorism
against the Dominion.

12
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:38,842
You've got to finish
what I started.

13
00:00:38,884 --> 00:00:41,082
The fate
of the entire Alpha Quadrant

14
00:00:41,123 --> 00:00:42,353
rests in your hands.

15
00:00:42,393 --> 00:00:44,090
What happens if I get caught?

16
00:00:52,484 --> 00:00:55,286
If those Dominion reinforcements
come through the wormhole

17
00:00:55,357 --> 00:00:56,690
we'll have lost everything.

18
00:00:56,727 --> 00:00:59,666
Then we take the ships we have,
fight our way to Deep Space 9

19
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:01,638
and destroy
the anti-graviton emitter.

20
00:01:01,672 --> 00:01:03,039
It's our only hope.

21
00:01:03,076 --> 00:01:05,172
Dukat is bringing
down the minefield

22
00:01:05,214 --> 00:01:07,378
the Federation is
about to be overrun

23
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,151
by the Dominion reinforcements

24
00:01:09,191 --> 00:01:11,492
and Weyoun has ordered
Rom's execution.

25
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,794
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:16,069
We are way, way past "sorry."

27
00:01:16,107 --> 00:01:19,012
It's a large Dominion fleet.

28
00:01:19,048 --> 00:01:20,415
1,254 ships.

29
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:22,182
They outnumber us two to one.

30
00:01:22,222 --> 00:01:24,284
There's an old saying...

31
00:01:24,394 --> 00:01:27,094
"Fortune favors the bold."

32
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:30,701
Well...

33
00:01:30,742 --> 00:01:33,374
I guess we're about to find out.

34
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,398
And now the conclusion.

35
00:02:03,253 --> 00:02:05,315
Sisko to all ships.

36
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,658
Cruiser and galaxy wings,
drop to half impulse.

37
00:02:07,698 --> 00:02:08,666
You, too, Commander.

38
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,668
Half impulse.

39
00:02:09,702 --> 00:02:11,536
I feel sorry for the Klingons.

40
00:02:11,574 --> 00:02:14,138
They're going to miss
a very interesting fight.

41
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,151
I have a feeling
we're going to miss them.

42
00:02:16,184 --> 00:02:17,551
Forget the Klingons.

43
00:02:17,588 --> 00:02:19,889
Our job is to get
to Deep Space 9

44
00:02:19,927 --> 00:02:21,692
and prevent
the Dominion reinforcements

45
00:02:21,731 --> 00:02:23,223
from coming through
the wormhole.

46
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,033
And that's
what we're going to do.

47
00:02:26,343 --> 00:02:29,579
Attack-fighters,
tactical pattern theta.

48
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:31,952
Concentrate your fire
on the Cardassian ships

49
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:34,017
and then split off
into squadrons

50
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,222
and run like hell.

51
00:02:35,263 --> 00:02:37,861
Why is he only targeting
the Cardassian ships?

52
00:02:37,903 --> 00:02:39,634
He's hoping to get them
to break formation

53
00:02:39,674 --> 00:02:41,907
so they'll go after
the Federation fighters.

54
00:02:41,946 --> 00:02:43,074
He knows the Jem'Hadar

55
00:02:43,116 --> 00:02:44,847
will stand their ground,
but the Cardassians

56
00:02:44,887 --> 00:02:47,883
might just get angry enough
to take the bait.

57
00:02:47,927 --> 00:02:50,330
Which would open a hole
we can punch through.

58
00:02:50,366 --> 00:02:52,029
You're getting
quite an education.

59
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:54,304
Attack-fighters
in theta formation.

60
00:02:54,343 --> 00:02:56,975
Cruiser and galaxy wings
at half impulse.

61
00:02:57,015 --> 00:02:58,644
Sisko to attack-fighters.

62
00:02:58,687 --> 00:03:00,783
Prepare to engage on my command.

63
00:03:00,825 --> 00:03:01,793
Aye, sir.

64
00:03:01,827 --> 00:03:02,921
"Cannon to the right of them

65
00:03:02,963 --> 00:03:04,057
"Cannon to the left of them

66
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:05,534
"Cannon in front of them

67
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:07,767
Volley'd and thunder'd..."

68
00:03:07,809 --> 00:03:09,871
"Storm'd at with shot and shell

69
00:03:09,914 --> 00:03:11,645
"Boldly they rode and well

70
00:03:11,684 --> 00:03:14,782
"Into the jaws of Death,
Into the mouth of Hell

71
00:03:14,825 --> 00:03:16,317
Rode the six hundred."

72
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,765
Whatever it is
you two are reciting

73
00:03:18,801 --> 00:03:19,963
I wish you'd stop.

74
00:03:20,004 --> 00:03:21,337
Steady, Ensign.
It's just a poem.

75
00:03:21,374 --> 00:03:23,845
It's not the poem
that's bothering me.

76
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,444
Stop worrying about those ships.

77
00:03:26,487 --> 00:03:28,458
Focus on your work.

78
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:29,687
That's what I do.

79
00:03:29,727 --> 00:03:31,698
You should listen to him,
Ensign.

80
00:03:31,732 --> 00:03:33,965
He's a professional.

81
00:03:34,974 --> 00:03:37,070
Attack-fighters, full impulse.

82
00:03:37,112 --> 00:03:38,274
Fire at will.

83
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,822
They're not taking the bait.

84
00:05:50,863 --> 00:05:52,834
Ensign, send in the second wave.

85
00:05:52,867 --> 00:05:54,667
Tell them to keep targeting
the Cardassians.

86
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:55,762
Aye, sir.

87
00:05:56,977 --> 00:05:58,446
Second wave on its way.

88
00:05:58,481 --> 00:06:00,952
Third and fourth wave
on hot standby.

89
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:03,824
Mr. O'Brien, have
destroyer units 2 and 6

90
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:04,886
move in closer.

91
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,627
They need more cover fire.

92
00:06:06,735 --> 00:06:08,500
And tell Captains
Diego and Reynolds

93
00:06:08,538 --> 00:06:09,632
to stay alert.

94
00:06:09,675 --> 00:06:11,703
They may try to outflank us.

95
00:06:25,212 --> 00:06:27,342
It's a very clever strategy.

96
00:06:27,384 --> 00:06:30,881
But then I'd expect nothing less
from Captain Sisko.

97
00:06:32,429 --> 00:06:36,838
The Captain is
a very clever man.

98
00:06:36,873 --> 00:06:39,573
You do see it, don't you?

99
00:06:39,613 --> 00:06:40,672
Of course I do.

100
00:06:40,715 --> 00:06:42,549
Well, then, perhaps you'd like

101
00:06:42,587 --> 00:06:45,081
to explain
Captain Sisko's strategy

102
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:46,891
to the Founder yourself.

103
00:06:46,931 --> 00:06:50,201
I could never hope
to match your eloquence.

104
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:51,674
True.

105
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:56,745
Sisko is trying to provoke us

106
00:06:56,788 --> 00:07:00,924
into opening a hole
in our lines.

107
00:07:00,965 --> 00:07:02,662
He's determined to get here

108
00:07:02,702 --> 00:07:05,573
and stop us from taking
down this minefield.

109
00:07:05,609 --> 00:07:07,512
Now, I plan...

110
00:07:07,547 --> 00:07:10,543
to give Sisko his opening...

111
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,253
and then...

112
00:07:13,294 --> 00:07:15,128
close it on him.

113
00:07:15,164 --> 00:07:18,001
What about the minefield?
Are we still on schedule?

114
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:20,704
We should be able
to detonate the mines

115
00:07:20,745 --> 00:07:21,735
in eight hours.

116
00:07:21,848 --> 00:07:23,511
Good.

117
00:07:25,022 --> 00:07:26,321
Eight hours.

118
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:29,024
I'll hold you to that, Dukat.

119
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:34,201
I'd like to toss
that smug little Vorta

120
00:07:34,244 --> 00:07:35,543
out the nearest airlock.

121
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:38,017
And his Founder with him.

122
00:07:38,053 --> 00:07:39,887
Now, now, Damar

123
00:07:39,924 --> 00:07:43,831
that's no way to talk
about our valued allies...

124
00:07:45,003 --> 00:07:48,500
not until this war
is over anyway.

125
00:07:48,545 --> 00:07:49,889
Sir, there is one other thing.

126
00:07:50,022 --> 00:07:51,514
Make it brief.

127
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:52,618
I'm concerned

128
00:07:52,662 --> 00:07:54,690
about further attempts
to sabotage this station.

129
00:07:54,734 --> 00:07:56,033
The enemy knows
if they don't act soon

130
00:07:56,071 --> 00:07:57,096
it'll be too late.

131
00:07:57,139 --> 00:07:59,440
By "enemy," I assume
you're referring

132
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:00,845
to Rom's associates.

133
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:02,282
I doubt whether
he was working alone

134
00:08:02,318 --> 00:08:03,844
when he tried
to sabotage this station.

135
00:08:03,888 --> 00:08:05,050
He must've had help.

136
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:06,684
His wife Leeta...

137
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:08,289
Jake Sisko...

138
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,495
Major Kira.

139
00:08:09,535 --> 00:08:11,061
What are you proposing?

140
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:13,442
That we arrest them
and keep them in custody

141
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:15,677
at least until the wormhole
is reopened.

142
00:08:15,717 --> 00:08:18,086
It's a wise precaution.

143
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:20,524
But our Bajoran allies

144
00:08:20,562 --> 00:08:24,732
might object
to an arrest without cause.

145
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:26,265
If anyone asks

146
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:30,980
we are merely holding them
for questioning, hmm?

147
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,649
And, Damar

148
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:37,134
make sure they're
not harmed in any way.

149
00:08:37,202 --> 00:08:40,665
Major Kira is important
to my daughter.

150
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,772
And to me.

151
00:08:42,816 --> 00:08:45,014
Sir, about your daughter...

152
00:08:45,054 --> 00:08:48,620
perhaps it would be better,
for her own sake

153
00:08:48,663 --> 00:08:51,636
if Ziyal were confined
to quarters.

154
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,934
For what reason?

155
00:08:52,973 --> 00:08:55,069
To be perfectly honest, sir

156
00:08:55,112 --> 00:08:57,379
I don't completely trust her.

157
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:59,285
And neither should you.

158
00:09:03,565 --> 00:09:07,267
Are you accusing my daughter
of being a saboteur?

159
00:09:07,307 --> 00:09:09,801
I'm not accusing her
of anything.

160
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:13,253
But she is... quite friendly
with Major Kira.

161
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:15,157
That will be all, Damar.

162
00:09:15,226 --> 00:09:18,165
She doesn't appreciate
what it means to be Cardassian

163
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:19,532
or to be your daughter.

164
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,874
But she is my daughter.

165
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:25,281
That may mean nothing to you

166
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:27,949
but it means everything to me.

167
00:09:38,148 --> 00:09:40,780
I heard the Federation
fleet has been ambushed.

168
00:09:40,821 --> 00:09:42,792
I heard two Cardassian soldiers

169
00:09:42,826 --> 00:09:45,594
saying the fleet was
completely destroyed.

170
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:48,903
Don't believe
everything you hear.

171
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,341
Jake's right.

172
00:09:50,377 --> 00:09:52,348
Sisko will get here.

173
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:53,510
The question is:

174
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,614
Will he get here soon enough?

175
00:09:55,657 --> 00:09:57,525
He's only got seven hours

176
00:09:57,561 --> 00:09:58,860
before they detonate
the minefield

177
00:09:58,897 --> 00:10:00,366
and start bringing
the reinforcements

178
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:01,927
through the wormhole.

179
00:10:01,972 --> 00:10:03,909
We've got to stop them.

180
00:10:03,943 --> 00:10:05,469
How?

181
00:10:05,514 --> 00:10:07,985
What if we cut off
the power supply

182
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,546
to the main computer?

183
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,993
Shut down the whole station.

184
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,465
Oh, great.

185
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,698
That would put me out
of business altogether.

186
00:10:15,738 --> 00:10:19,144
Well, it would also keep them
from detonating the mines.

187
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,549
Okay...

188
00:10:21,585 --> 00:10:24,524
so we shut down
the main computer.

189
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:26,028
How?

190
00:10:26,063 --> 00:10:27,555
A bomb.

191
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:28,898
A bomb?!

192
00:10:28,936 --> 00:10:32,638
What kind of bomb?

193
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:34,809
Leave that to me.

194
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:36,947
It'll be crude, but effective.

195
00:10:36,989 --> 00:10:39,621
The main computer
is in the Central Core.

196
00:10:39,662 --> 00:10:42,328
It's too heavily guarded.

197
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,045
You'll never be able
to smuggle a bomb into there.

198
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:51,754
I'll plant the bomb.

199
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,628
All we need to do is
distract the guards.

200
00:10:54,664 --> 00:10:56,361
In here.
Secure the door.

201
00:10:58,608 --> 00:11:00,271
Ah, Major, there you are.

202
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:02,509
How nice of you
to gather your friends for us.

203
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,817
I'm off duty, Damar.
What do you want?

204
00:11:04,855 --> 00:11:06,620
I want you to come with us,
all three of you.

205
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,593
Where?

206
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:09,360
To the Security Office.

207
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:12,201
We have to ask you
a few questions.

208
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,869
What kind of questions?

209
00:11:13,911 --> 00:11:15,608
You'll find out
when we get there.

210
00:11:18,856 --> 00:11:21,522
Go ahead, Major, try something.

211
00:11:21,563 --> 00:11:24,034
Nothing would make me happier.

212
00:11:25,873 --> 00:11:27,901
Don't worry.
It'll be all right.

213
00:11:27,945 --> 00:11:29,848
Of course it will.

214
00:11:29,882 --> 00:11:33,118
You've nothing to hide, do you?

215
00:11:36,532 --> 00:11:38,560
You certainly don't.

216
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,117
I'll say this for Captain Sisko,
he is persistent.

217
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:01,419
That's the ninth wave
of Federation fighters

218
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,586
he's sent against us.

219
00:12:02,627 --> 00:12:06,967
Well, his persistence
is about to pay off.

220
00:12:07,004 --> 00:12:10,809
Let's give him
his reward, shall we?

221
00:12:10,847 --> 00:12:13,684
Have a half dozen
squadrons break formation

222
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:16,124
and go after those fighters.

223
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,652
Yes, sir.

224
00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:27,647
Two squadrons
of Cardassian attack ships

225
00:12:27,687 --> 00:12:29,122
are breaking formation.

226
00:12:29,157 --> 00:12:30,649
They're going
after our fighters.

227
00:12:30,695 --> 00:12:32,666
They're taking the bait.

228
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:34,066
We've opened a hole
in their lines.

229
00:12:34,103 --> 00:12:35,128
Have we?

230
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:37,336
Sir, do you see
those Galore-class destroyers?

231
00:12:37,378 --> 00:12:38,506
I see them.

232
00:12:38,546 --> 00:12:39,514
It's a trap.

233
00:12:39,616 --> 00:12:41,142
It is also an opportunity

234
00:12:41,186 --> 00:12:43,157
and we may not get
another one.

235
00:12:43,191 --> 00:12:48,033
Ensign, have Galaxy Wings 9-1
and 9-3 engage those destroyers.

236
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,870
All other ships,
head for that opening.

237
00:12:49,907 --> 00:12:51,638
Anyone who gets through
doesn't stop

238
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,205
until they reach Deep Space 9.

239
00:13:19,345 --> 00:13:20,871
Congratulations, Captain!

240
00:13:20,915 --> 00:13:23,148
You wanted them angry,
they're angry.

241
00:13:23,187 --> 00:13:24,315
The <i>Magellan</i> and the <i>Venture</i>

242
00:13:24,357 --> 00:13:26,088
are supposed to be protecting
our starboard flanks.

243
00:13:26,128 --> 00:13:27,153
They're in too tight.

244
00:13:27,196 --> 00:13:29,360
Ensign, tell fighter
squadrons 6, 7 and 8 to...

245
00:13:29,402 --> 00:13:31,396
Sir, I can't
get through to anybody.

246
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,499
Communications are down.

247
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,507
They're jamming our signal

248
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,851
by generating
a rotating EM pulse.

249
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:38,983
Can you clear it?

250
00:13:39,025 --> 00:13:40,928
I'm trying.

251
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:51,117
War is such... thirsty work.

252
00:13:51,154 --> 00:13:52,783
Don't you agree?

253
00:13:52,825 --> 00:13:54,625
Perhaps if you didn't
talk so much

254
00:13:54,729 --> 00:13:56,563
your throat wouldn't get so dry.

255
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:00,575
Cardassians do like to talk.

256
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,583
I suppose it can be
a failing at times.

257
00:14:03,617 --> 00:14:05,747
No.

258
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:09,754
To the conquerors
of the Federation.

259
00:14:11,302 --> 00:14:14,765
Aren't you being
a bit premature?

260
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:17,112
I don't think so.

261
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:20,612
Not with 2800 Dominion ships

262
00:14:20,725 --> 00:14:22,992
waiting to come
through that wormhole.

263
00:14:23,031 --> 00:14:24,625
Well, those ships
aren't going to be here

264
00:14:24,701 --> 00:14:26,569
for another five hours,
and need I remind you

265
00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:28,269
a lot can happen
in that amount of time.

266
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,281
Oh!

267
00:14:30,315 --> 00:14:32,046
Tell me, Weyoun...

268
00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:38,429
have you ever been diagnosed
as anhedonic?

269
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:40,802
You think I'm incapable
of experiencing joy

270
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,536
just because I'm cautious?

271
00:14:42,577 --> 00:14:45,573
We didn't defeat the Federation
by being cautious.

272
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,034
We haven't defeated it yet

273
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:50,573
and even if we do,
it's only the beginning.

274
00:14:50,609 --> 00:14:52,876
Holding onto a prize
as vast as the Federation

275
00:14:52,914 --> 00:14:54,474
isn't going to be easy.

276
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,789
It's going to require
an enormous number of ships

277
00:14:57,826 --> 00:15:00,799
a massive occupation army...

278
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,832
and constant vigilance.

279
00:15:04,877 --> 00:15:08,750
I look forward to it.

280
00:15:08,786 --> 00:15:12,853
I'm sure you also looked forward
to occupying Bajor

281
00:15:12,896 --> 00:15:15,425
and we all know what
a disappointment that was.

282
00:15:15,469 --> 00:15:16,768
Ah, ah, ah, ah...

283
00:15:16,805 --> 00:15:19,835
On Bajor,
I merely implemented policy.

284
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:21,280
I didn't make it.

285
00:15:21,316 --> 00:15:25,018
If I had, things would have
turned out quite differently.

286
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:27,690
If you ask me

287
00:15:27,731 --> 00:15:32,197
the key to holding
the Federation...

288
00:15:32,242 --> 00:15:34,270
is Earth.

289
00:15:34,314 --> 00:15:36,114
If there's going to be

290
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:38,146
an organized
resistance against us

291
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,719
its birthplace will be there.

292
00:15:40,762 --> 00:15:42,733
You could be right.

293
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:48,509
Then our first step
is to eradicate its population.

294
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,849
It's the only way.

295
00:15:50,886 --> 00:15:52,515
You can't do that.

296
00:15:52,558 --> 00:15:54,529
Why not?

297
00:15:54,563 --> 00:15:56,328
Because!

298
00:15:56,367 --> 00:15:58,838
A true victory

299
00:15:58,873 --> 00:16:00,741
is to make your enemy see

300
00:16:00,777 --> 00:16:04,081
they were wrong to oppose you
in the first place.

301
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:09,861
To force them...
to acknowledge your greatness.

302
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:11,596
Then you kill them?

303
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:15,703
Only if it's necessary.

304
00:16:18,453 --> 00:16:21,051
I had no idea.

305
00:16:26,138 --> 00:16:29,909
Perhaps the biggest
disappointment in my life

306
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:33,786
is that the Bajoran people
still refuse to appreciate

307
00:16:33,823 --> 00:16:37,457
how lucky they were
to have me as their liberator.

308
00:16:37,532 --> 00:16:41,303
I protected them
in so many ways...

309
00:16:41,341 --> 00:16:45,146
cared for them
as if they were my own children

310
00:16:45,183 --> 00:16:46,948
but to this day

311
00:16:46,988 --> 00:16:53,095
is there a single...
statue of me on Bajor?

312
00:16:53,136 --> 00:16:54,936
I would guess not.

313
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:57,207
And you'd be right.

314
00:17:01,489 --> 00:17:05,454
Take Captain Sisko...

315
00:17:05,499 --> 00:17:10,205
an otherwise intelligent,
perceptive man, hmm?

316
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:18,823
Even he refuses to grant me
the respect I deserve.

317
00:17:20,469 --> 00:17:21,768
You find that amusing?

318
00:17:21,804 --> 00:17:22,898
Not at all.

319
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:24,672
I find it...

320
00:17:27,051 --> 00:17:28,680
...fascinating.

321
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:30,190
Laugh all you want.

322
00:17:30,225 --> 00:17:33,426
History will prove me right.

323
00:17:38,077 --> 00:17:40,378
I have news, Odo.

324
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:44,221
Our battle with the Federation
fleet is going well.

325
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:46,788
There are people
out there fighting...

326
00:17:46,831 --> 00:17:48,232
dying...

327
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:51,070
people who used
to be my friends.

328
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:52,908
They're solids, Odo.

329
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,677
You must remember that.

330
00:17:54,716 --> 00:17:58,852
I know, but they still
mean something to me.

331
00:17:58,893 --> 00:18:00,864
The Link means more.

332
00:18:02,235 --> 00:18:04,867
That's what I keep
telling myself

333
00:18:04,908 --> 00:18:08,040
but somehow I can't
quite believe it.

334
00:18:08,082 --> 00:18:11,214
You asked me for clarity, Odo.

335
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,285
I gave it to you.

336
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:16,302
Now you must accept it.

337
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:19,241
It's Major Kira, isn't it?

338
00:18:19,276 --> 00:18:23,378
You still have
strong feelings for her.

339
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:26,085
She doesn't deserve
your loyalty, Odo.

340
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,689
You cannot allow a solid
to deny you

341
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,603
your rightful place
in the Great Link.

342
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:33,701
I couldn't permit it.

343
00:18:33,744 --> 00:18:36,615
What are you saying?

344
00:18:36,651 --> 00:18:39,522
The Major has been arrested.

345
00:18:39,557 --> 00:18:41,026
On what charge?

346
00:18:41,061 --> 00:18:42,189
That hardly matters.

347
00:18:42,231 --> 00:18:45,170
What matters is
she will be found guilty

348
00:18:45,204 --> 00:18:46,935
and sentenced to death.

349
00:18:46,976 --> 00:18:48,947
No.

350
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,112
Her death is your salvation.

351
00:18:52,155 --> 00:18:54,251
Link with me, Odo.

352
00:18:54,293 --> 00:18:56,287
Embrace the clarity.

353
00:18:56,331 --> 00:19:00,398
It is the only thing
that will give you peace.

354
00:19:00,441 --> 00:19:01,740
No.

355
00:19:01,777 --> 00:19:04,409
You cannot help her, Odo.

356
00:19:04,451 --> 00:19:07,015
You cannot help
any of the solids

357
00:19:07,057 --> 00:19:10,623
no matter how much
you may want to.

358
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,001
It's too late for them.

359
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:30,645
Sir, we've just lost
the <i>Sitak</i> and the <i>Majestic.</i>

360
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,808
We're on our own.

361
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:32,977
Com's back on line!

362
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:35,685
Four enemy ships directly ahead!

363
00:19:35,726 --> 00:19:38,324
Evasive maneuvers...
pattern omega.

364
00:19:38,365 --> 00:19:40,359
We're going through!

365
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:53,961
That's one down.

366
00:19:54,002 --> 00:19:55,733
Can we shake the other three?

367
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:57,003
I'm trying.

368
00:20:00,218 --> 00:20:01,346
We've lost aft shields.

369
00:20:01,387 --> 00:20:03,324
Forward shields
are down to 15 percent.

370
00:20:03,358 --> 00:20:06,160
Wouldn't this be
a good time to cloak?

371
00:20:06,198 --> 00:20:08,328
The cloaking system's fried.

372
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,170
Auxiliary power to weapons.

373
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,976
We're going to fight
our way out of this.

374
00:20:27,383 --> 00:20:28,613
It's the Klingons, sir.

375
00:20:28,653 --> 00:20:29,747
They're here.

376
00:20:29,788 --> 00:20:32,225
We're being hailed
by Commander Worf.

377
00:20:32,261 --> 00:20:33,594
On screen.

378
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:37,265
Captain,
I'm sorry we were late.

379
00:20:37,307 --> 00:20:39,608
It was not easy
to convince Chancellor Gowron

380
00:20:39,645 --> 00:20:40,807
to spare us any ships.

381
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:43,251
I'm just glad you could
join us, Commander.

382
00:20:43,287 --> 00:20:45,190
Captain, the Klingons
have broken a hole

383
00:20:45,225 --> 00:20:46,284
in the Dominion lines.

384
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,854
Dax, can you get us through?

385
00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:48,924
I'd love to try.

386
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,392
Any other ships make it?

387
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:07,061
No, sir.

388
00:21:10,077 --> 00:21:11,877
We only have three hours

389
00:21:11,914 --> 00:21:14,147
before the minefields
are detonated.

390
00:21:14,186 --> 00:21:16,282
Set a course for Deep Space 9.

391
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:17,726
Maximum warp.

392
00:21:22,273 --> 00:21:24,905
The <i>Defiant</i> has broken through
all our lines.

393
00:21:24,945 --> 00:21:26,312
It's on its way here.

394
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:27,909
Shall I order a pursuit?

395
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:28,921
At once.

396
00:21:30,225 --> 00:21:33,323
The <i>Defiant</i> is no match
for this station.

397
00:21:33,366 --> 00:21:36,464
If Sisko wants to commit suicide

398
00:21:36,507 --> 00:21:39,241
I say we let him.

399
00:21:51,042 --> 00:21:52,945
Don't scream.

400
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,974
I won't hurt you.

401
00:22:02,536 --> 00:22:05,304
I just have one question.

402
00:22:05,343 --> 00:22:07,746
What's that?

403
00:22:07,782 --> 00:22:11,382
Do you know how to make
<i>hasperat</i> soufflé?

404
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,168
Lunch for Major Kira.

405
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:20,906
Major Kira
has already been fed.

406
00:22:20,947 --> 00:22:23,852
And I can only imagine
the slop you served her.

407
00:22:23,887 --> 00:22:26,120
What I have here
is <i>hasperat</i> soufflé

408
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,460
just the way
the Major likes it.

409
00:22:28,498 --> 00:22:30,867
This is a jail, not a hotel.

410
00:22:30,904 --> 00:22:34,105
The Major will eat
what the other prisoners eat.

411
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:35,546
Do you know who I am?

412
00:22:35,582 --> 00:22:37,176
Gul Dukat's daughter.

413
00:22:37,219 --> 00:22:38,449
That's right.

414
00:22:38,488 --> 00:22:42,054
Now, I suggest you allow
us to deliver this food.

415
00:22:42,097 --> 00:22:43,259
I can't do that.

416
00:22:44,637 --> 00:22:46,129
However...

417
00:22:46,174 --> 00:22:48,372
I will take the tray to her.

418
00:22:48,412 --> 00:22:49,904
After I examine it.

419
00:22:49,949 --> 00:22:54,085
Um... is that really necessary?

420
00:22:54,126 --> 00:22:55,390
Lift the lid.

421
00:22:55,429 --> 00:22:57,764
If you insist.

422
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:03,775
You see?

423
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:05,684
<i>Hasperat</i> soufflé.

424
00:23:05,787 --> 00:23:07,815
Just as I said.

425
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,605
Stop poking it.

426
00:23:18,151 --> 00:23:19,347
It's very delicate.

427
00:23:25,735 --> 00:23:28,367
Now you've ruined it.

428
00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:40,067
How much longer before they
detonate the minefield?

429
00:23:40,103 --> 00:23:42,267
I wish you'd stop asking that.

430
00:23:42,308 --> 00:23:44,279
Sorry.

431
00:23:44,313 --> 00:23:48,084
I'd say about 90 minutes.

432
00:23:48,123 --> 00:23:50,060
My time grows short.

433
00:23:50,093 --> 00:23:51,392
Don't say that.

434
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,403
The only reason
they haven't killed me yet

435
00:23:54,437 --> 00:23:56,567
is that I'm part
of their victory celebration.

436
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:58,739
7:00: Dukat makes a speech.

437
00:23:58,781 --> 00:24:01,150
8:30: Cake and <i>raktajino.</i>

438
00:24:01,187 --> 00:24:04,753
8:45: Execute the Ferengi.

439
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:05,761
All right...

440
00:24:05,864 --> 00:24:06,661
no one move!

441
00:24:07,869 --> 00:24:08,768
Brother!

442
00:24:08,805 --> 00:24:10,468
I knew you would come.

443
00:24:10,509 --> 00:24:12,673
It's a surprise to me.

444
00:24:12,714 --> 00:24:16,781
Now, just keep calm and stay
where you are.

445
00:24:16,858 --> 00:24:17,848
Understand?
Don't move.

446
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:24,776
You...

447
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,872
open the holding cells.

448
00:24:28,819 --> 00:24:29,947
I said

449
00:24:29,989 --> 00:24:32,290
open the holding cells.

450
00:24:32,328 --> 00:24:34,731
You just told them
not to move.

451
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:36,259
Right.

452
00:24:37,608 --> 00:24:39,579
Nobody moves... except you.

453
00:24:39,613 --> 00:24:40,843
Now...

454
00:24:40,915 --> 00:24:43,854
open the cells.

455
00:24:56,052 --> 00:24:57,214
Quark?

456
00:24:58,391 --> 00:24:59,519
Yes?

457
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,120
Take down the force fields.

458
00:25:01,164 --> 00:25:03,431
Force fields...

459
00:25:12,424 --> 00:25:15,762
I'd kiss you, Quark,
but there isn't time.

460
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:17,234
We have to find a way
to shut down

461
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:18,294
the power to the main computer.

462
00:25:18,339 --> 00:25:19,307
I can do that.

463
00:25:19,341 --> 00:25:20,309
Oh, Rom.

464
00:25:20,344 --> 00:25:21,472
That is, if we can make it

465
00:25:21,512 --> 00:25:23,243
to the Central Computer
Core without being killed.

466
00:25:23,284 --> 00:25:24,343
Right.
Rom, you're with me.

467
00:25:24,386 --> 00:25:25,354
The rest of you

468
00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:26,722
find someplace to stay
out of sight.

469
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:27,748
Will do.

470
00:25:33,943 --> 00:25:36,107
I know you're confused, Odo

471
00:25:36,148 --> 00:25:38,210
but you don't have to be.

472
00:25:38,253 --> 00:25:41,124
All the answers you
seek are in the Link.

473
00:25:43,465 --> 00:25:44,661
Come in.

474
00:25:48,277 --> 00:25:49,940
Forgive the intrusion

475
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:53,511
but Major Kira,
the Ferengi saboteur

476
00:25:53,556 --> 00:25:55,527
and the rest of their
terrorist group have escaped

477
00:25:55,561 --> 00:25:57,532
from the holding cells.

478
00:25:57,566 --> 00:25:58,830
For your own protection

479
00:25:58,868 --> 00:26:00,428
I must ask you to come with me.

480
00:26:00,473 --> 00:26:02,706
I want them caught.

481
00:26:02,745 --> 00:26:04,773
They will be.

482
00:26:04,817 --> 00:26:07,915
But in the meantime,
you'll both be safer in Ops.

483
00:26:07,957 --> 00:26:09,358
Very well.

484
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,534
Odo?

485
00:26:16,578 --> 00:26:18,446
I'll be fine here.

486
00:26:19,886 --> 00:26:21,583
You're sure?

487
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:23,560
Yes.

488
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:40,994
Get out of here!

489
00:27:00,817 --> 00:27:02,013
Do you hear that?

490
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:04,355
That's Bajoran phaser fire.

491
00:27:07,266 --> 00:27:10,832
Why would Dominion troops
be using Bajoran weapons?

492
00:27:31,424 --> 00:27:34,728
Never underestimate
the element of surprise.

493
00:27:38,608 --> 00:27:41,672
You have less than 40 minutes
to shut down the main computer.

494
00:27:41,715 --> 00:27:43,048
I hope that's enough time.

495
00:27:43,085 --> 00:27:44,315
It'll have to be.

496
00:27:44,355 --> 00:27:46,349
Can you keep the Dominion
patrols off our backs?

497
00:27:46,393 --> 00:27:48,022
I'll head down to Security.

498
00:27:48,064 --> 00:27:50,535
Create enough false alarms
to keep them occupied.

499
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:51,595
Any questions?

500
00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:52,903
I could ask why?

501
00:27:52,942 --> 00:27:56,109
I don't think there's time
to explain it.

502
00:27:56,149 --> 00:27:58,747
Besides, I think
you know the answer.

503
00:28:03,501 --> 00:28:04,877
What about the Link?

504
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:09,077
The Link... was paradise.

505
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:12,753
But it appears
I'm not ready for paradise.

506
00:28:15,301 --> 00:28:16,269
Good luck.

507
00:28:16,304 --> 00:28:17,363
You, too.

508
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:33,842
Dax, what's our ETA?

509
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,007
11 minutes.

510
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:36,849
That's cutting it close.

511
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:42,763
How's it going, Rom?

512
00:28:42,801 --> 00:28:44,863
I wish you'd stop asking that.

513
00:28:44,905 --> 00:28:45,964
Sorry, sorry.

514
00:28:51,455 --> 00:28:53,722
I'm not going to make it.

515
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,824
All right, then concentrate
on cutting off the power

516
00:28:56,867 --> 00:28:58,701
to the station's weapons array.

517
00:28:58,739 --> 00:28:59,901
Without weapons

518
00:28:59,975 --> 00:29:02,607
they won't be able
to detonate the minefield.

519
00:29:02,648 --> 00:29:04,744
Not for a while anyway.

520
00:29:08,629 --> 00:29:11,363
Sir, the Klingons
have outflanked us.

521
00:29:12,438 --> 00:29:14,534
Our lines are
beginning to crumble.

522
00:29:14,577 --> 00:29:16,980
There's nothing to worry about.

523
00:29:17,015 --> 00:29:18,780
In exactly four minutes

524
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,414
thousands of Dominion ships

525
00:29:20,457 --> 00:29:22,792
will come pouring
through that wormhole.

526
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,462
I just hope the <i>Defiant</i>
gets here in time

527
00:29:25,503 --> 00:29:27,599
for Sisko to see it.

528
00:29:30,615 --> 00:29:31,777
Ben, if I were you

529
00:29:31,818 --> 00:29:34,153
I'd start coming up
with a Plan "B."

530
00:29:36,262 --> 00:29:37,390
Almost there.

531
00:29:37,431 --> 00:29:40,837
I just need to decouple
the ODN relays.

532
00:29:40,873 --> 00:29:43,310
The last mines have
been neutralized.

533
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,459
We're ready to detonate
the minefield, sir.

534
00:29:59,217 --> 00:30:00,311
Fire!

535
00:30:00,353 --> 00:30:01,879
Done.

536
00:30:06,935 --> 00:30:08,097
Uh-oh.

537
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:11,635
What is it?

538
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:15,988
We were too late.

539
00:30:29,122 --> 00:30:31,252
What do we do now, Captain?

540
00:30:31,294 --> 00:30:33,731
Take us into the wormhole.

541
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:35,066
What the hell.

542
00:30:35,103 --> 00:30:36,197
We're only going to meet

543
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:37,868
a couple of thousand
Dominion ships.

544
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:40,073
One ship
against an entire fleet?

545
00:30:40,182 --> 00:30:41,617
That's a hell of a Plan "B."

546
00:30:41,652 --> 00:30:44,750
Chief,
how does that poem end?

547
00:30:45,896 --> 00:30:47,661
You don't want to know.

548
00:30:52,143 --> 00:30:53,305
Send a message

549
00:30:53,347 --> 00:30:56,081
to our listening posts
in the Gamma Quadrant.

550
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,555
Tell the reinforcements

551
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:00,290
that the Alpha Quadrant
awaits them.

552
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:02,301
Sir...

553
00:31:02,335 --> 00:31:05,001
the <i>Defiant...</i>
it's heading for the wormhole.

554
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:06,476
Destroy it.

555
00:31:10,121 --> 00:31:11,955
What's wrong, Damar?

556
00:31:11,991 --> 00:31:13,221
Our weapons...

557
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:16,097
they're off-line.

558
00:31:16,201 --> 00:31:17,830
They've been sabotaged.

559
00:31:17,872 --> 00:31:19,364
How can that be?

560
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,439
Major Kira.

561
00:31:35,181 --> 00:31:36,548
Full stop.

562
00:31:36,584 --> 00:31:39,922
Chief, divert all power
to forward shields and weapons.

563
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:43,125
Captain, I'm reading
multiple warp signatures ahead.

564
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:44,134
On screen.

565
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:46,139
Maximum magnification.

566
00:31:54,392 --> 00:31:56,454
Lock phasers.

567
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:59,699
Prepare to launch
quantum torpedoes.

568
00:32:08,025 --> 00:32:10,189
Why have you brought me here?

569
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,304
Show yourselves.

570
00:32:17,482 --> 00:32:19,145
What do you want?

571
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,788
The Sisko has returned to us.

572
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,733
He arrives with questions.

573
00:32:25,768 --> 00:32:27,739
There are always questions.

574
00:32:27,773 --> 00:32:31,909
I didn't ask to come here.

575
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,148
You desire to end the game.

576
00:32:34,188 --> 00:32:36,717
What game?

577
00:32:36,761 --> 00:32:38,458
I don't understand.

578
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:42,234
You seek to shed
your corporeal existence.

579
00:32:42,341 --> 00:32:43,935
That cannot be allowed.

580
00:32:43,979 --> 00:32:46,177
The game must not end.

581
00:32:46,217 --> 00:32:47,185
The game.

582
00:32:47,219 --> 00:32:49,247
You mean my life.

583
00:32:49,324 --> 00:32:52,195
Is that what this is about?

584
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:54,795
You don't want me to die?

585
00:32:54,838 --> 00:32:57,811
The game must continue.

586
00:32:57,845 --> 00:32:59,280
You are the Sisko.

587
00:32:59,382 --> 00:33:02,754
Believe me, I don't want to die,
but I have to do

588
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:05,558
everything I can
to prevent the Dominion

589
00:33:05,597 --> 00:33:08,000
from conquering
the Alpha Quadrant.

590
00:33:08,036 --> 00:33:11,772
If that means sacrificing
my life and the life of my crew

591
00:33:11,812 --> 00:33:13,509
so be it.

592
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:15,713
We do not agree.

593
00:33:15,754 --> 00:33:17,519
We find your reasoning flawed.

594
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:19,621
Insufficient.

595
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:23,571
I'm flattered you feel that way,
but it doesn't change anything.

596
00:33:23,606 --> 00:33:25,509
Now, send me back to my ship.

597
00:33:28,618 --> 00:33:30,144
This isn't what I meant.

598
00:33:30,189 --> 00:33:32,160
I want to return to my reality.

599
00:33:32,194 --> 00:33:35,691
You are the Sisko.

600
00:33:35,736 --> 00:33:38,173
I am also a Starfleet Captain.

601
00:33:38,209 --> 00:33:41,307
I have a job to do
and I intend to do it.

602
00:33:41,382 --> 00:33:44,048
The Sisko is belligerent.

603
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:45,889
Aggressive.

604
00:33:45,926 --> 00:33:47,794
Adversarial.

605
00:33:47,831 --> 00:33:50,325
You're damn right
I'm adversarial.

606
00:33:50,438 --> 00:33:53,844
You have no right
to interfere with my life.

607
00:33:53,879 --> 00:33:55,975
We have every right.

608
00:33:56,017 --> 00:33:57,646
Fine.

609
00:33:57,688 --> 00:33:59,248
You want to interfere?

610
00:33:59,292 --> 00:34:01,160
Then interfere.

611
00:34:01,197 --> 00:34:04,193
Do something about
those Dominion reinforcements.

612
00:34:04,237 --> 00:34:06,674
That is a corporeal matter.

613
00:34:06,709 --> 00:34:09,945
Corporeal matters
do not concern us.

614
00:34:09,984 --> 00:34:11,510
The hell they don't.

615
00:34:11,555 --> 00:34:13,924
What about Bajor?

616
00:34:13,961 --> 00:34:16,832
You can't tell me
Bajor doesn't concern you.

617
00:34:16,868 --> 00:34:20,309
You've sent the Bajorans
Orbs and Emissaries.

618
00:34:20,342 --> 00:34:22,472
You've even encouraged them

619
00:34:22,514 --> 00:34:25,180
to create
an entire religion around you.

620
00:34:25,221 --> 00:34:27,887
You even told me once
that you were of Bajor.

621
00:34:27,927 --> 00:34:29,157
So don't you tell me

622
00:34:29,197 --> 00:34:31,668
you're not concerned
with corporeal matters.

623
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:34,676
I don't want
to see Bajor destroyed.

624
00:34:34,711 --> 00:34:38,379
Neither do you, but we all know

625
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:40,321
that's exactly
what's going to happen

626
00:34:40,357 --> 00:34:42,828
if the Dominion takes over
the Alpha Quadrant.

627
00:34:42,863 --> 00:34:45,859
You say you don't want me
to sacrifice my life.

628
00:34:45,904 --> 00:34:47,134
Well, fine.

629
00:34:47,173 --> 00:34:48,369
Neither do I.

630
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:50,677
You want to be Gods.

631
00:34:50,715 --> 00:34:52,412
Then be Gods.

632
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:54,216
I need a miracle.

633
00:34:54,257 --> 00:34:56,660
Bajor needs a miracle.

634
00:34:56,696 --> 00:34:59,328
Stop those ships!

635
00:34:59,369 --> 00:35:01,066
We are of Bajor.

636
00:35:01,106 --> 00:35:03,236
But what of the Sisko?

637
00:35:03,278 --> 00:35:05,306
He is intrusive.

638
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:08,517
He tries to control the game.

639
00:35:08,558 --> 00:35:11,395
A penance must be exacted.

640
00:35:14,138 --> 00:35:15,732
It is agreed.

641
00:35:15,775 --> 00:35:21,449
The Sisko is of Bajor,
but he will find no rest there.

642
00:35:26,868 --> 00:35:31,243
His <i>pagh</i> will follow
another path.

643
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:33,512
What path is that?

644
00:35:35,188 --> 00:35:37,455
Phaser banks fully charged.

645
00:35:37,494 --> 00:35:39,075
Forward shields at 100 percent.

646
00:35:39,209 --> 00:35:40,142
Torpedoes ready.

647
00:35:40,178 --> 00:35:41,146
Targets locked.

648
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,740
Here they come.

649
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:45,551
Fire on my command.

650
00:35:51,137 --> 00:35:53,005
There must be thousands of them.

651
00:35:53,042 --> 00:35:54,910
And half of them
have locked targets on us.

652
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:56,246
Steady, people.

653
00:35:56,284 --> 00:35:57,878
Make every shot count.

654
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:01,758
Benjamin.

655
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,735
They've cloaked.

656
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:21,868
I'm not picking up
any neutrino emissions.

657
00:36:21,911 --> 00:36:24,645
Then... where did they go?

658
00:36:24,684 --> 00:36:26,244
Wherever they went...

659
00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:28,887
I don't think
they're coming back.

660
00:36:34,842 --> 00:36:37,336
Sir, the wormhole is opening.

661
00:36:40,923 --> 00:36:42,688
The <i>Defiant.</i>

662
00:36:42,728 --> 00:36:46,066
Our reinforcements
must be right behind.

663
00:36:48,609 --> 00:36:49,577
No, sir.

664
00:36:49,611 --> 00:36:51,707
There's no sign of them.

665
00:36:51,749 --> 00:36:52,843
That's impossible.

666
00:36:52,886 --> 00:36:56,349
Check our listening posts
in the Gamma Quadrant.

667
00:36:56,394 --> 00:36:58,023
They're not there, either.

668
00:36:58,065 --> 00:37:00,036
But they entered the wormhole.

669
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:02,007
Where are they?!

670
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:03,442
I don't know.

671
00:37:05,382 --> 00:37:07,285
The <i>Defiant</i> has opened fire
on us!

672
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,949
Obviously.

673
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,790
Can you get our weapons
back on line?

674
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:12,264
Not for a while.

675
00:37:13,334 --> 00:37:14,735
Sir, 200 enemy ships

676
00:37:14,771 --> 00:37:16,935
have broken through our lines.

677
00:37:16,976 --> 00:37:18,206
They're headed this way.

678
00:37:18,246 --> 00:37:20,376
Time to start packing.

679
00:37:20,418 --> 00:37:23,414
Contact our forces
in the Alpha Quadrant.

680
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:26,955
Tell them to fall back
to the Cardassian territory.

681
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,094
It appears this war

682
00:37:28,137 --> 00:37:30,404
is going to take
longer than expected.

683
00:37:32,347 --> 00:37:34,443
We'll meet you at Airlock Five.

684
00:37:38,027 --> 00:37:40,055
Sir?

685
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:42,628
Victory was within our grasp.

686
00:37:42,671 --> 00:37:45,769
We have to evacuate
the station, sir!

687
00:37:45,813 --> 00:37:46,781
Bajor...

688
00:37:46,815 --> 00:37:48,250
the Federation...

689
00:37:48,285 --> 00:37:51,281
the Alpha Quadrant...

690
00:37:51,325 --> 00:37:52,419
all lost.

691
00:37:52,462 --> 00:37:54,159
We have to go now, sir.

692
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,167
Go?

693
00:37:55,202 --> 00:37:56,501
The Federation ships...

694
00:37:56,538 --> 00:37:57,734
they'll be here soon.

695
00:37:57,774 --> 00:37:59,642
We have to get back
to Cardassia.

696
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:01,547
I have to find my daughter.

697
00:38:01,584 --> 00:38:03,418
I'll send someone for her!

698
00:38:03,454 --> 00:38:06,188
That won't be necessary.

699
00:38:06,228 --> 00:38:07,527
You're wasting your time!

700
00:38:07,564 --> 00:38:10,435
Promenade!

701
00:38:10,471 --> 00:38:13,273
She won't go with you!

702
00:38:13,311 --> 00:38:16,443
Sir, the Dominion forces
are leaving the station.

703
00:38:16,486 --> 00:38:17,454
Let them go.

704
00:38:17,488 --> 00:38:19,288
We're in no shape to stop them.

705
00:38:19,326 --> 00:38:22,562
Captain, we're getting
a message from the <i>Cortéz.</i>

706
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,129
The Dominion fleet
have broken off the fight.

707
00:38:25,173 --> 00:38:26,472
They're in retreat.

708
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:29,951
Tell the <i>Cortéz</i>
and the rest of the fleet

709
00:38:29,984 --> 00:38:32,786
to rendezvous at Deep Space 9.

710
00:38:42,682 --> 00:38:44,311
All Dominion personnel

711
00:38:44,353 --> 00:38:48,693
proceed to Airlocks 4, 7 and 12
for evacuation.

712
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,701
This is a first priority order.

713
00:38:50,734 --> 00:38:53,103
Repeat, all Dominion personnel

714
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:57,139
proceed to Airlocks 4, 7 and 12
for evacuation.

715
00:38:57,183 --> 00:38:59,017
Out of the way, out of the way.

716
00:38:59,088 --> 00:39:00,717
Step aside.

717
00:39:00,758 --> 00:39:03,252
Make way for the Founder.

718
00:39:03,298 --> 00:39:06,294
What about Odo?
Is he coming with us?

719
00:39:06,338 --> 00:39:08,673
No.

720
00:39:08,711 --> 00:39:11,809
But he will join us one day.

721
00:39:11,852 --> 00:39:14,450
It's only a matter of time.

722
00:39:26,286 --> 00:39:27,185
Father!

723
00:39:28,926 --> 00:39:30,452
Ah, Ziyal.

724
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:36,572
I've been looking for you.

725
00:39:36,611 --> 00:39:38,639
I heard about the evacuation.

726
00:39:38,682 --> 00:39:39,981
You're all I have...

727
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:42,047
all I care about.

728
00:39:42,124 --> 00:39:44,790
No matter how much
I try to hate you

729
00:39:44,831 --> 00:39:46,300
I can't.

730
00:39:46,334 --> 00:39:50,002
I couldn't live with myself
if you hated me.

731
00:39:50,043 --> 00:39:52,071
Come.

732
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,084
We'll talk on the way home.

733
00:39:54,153 --> 00:39:55,486
Home?

734
00:39:56,793 --> 00:39:58,387
Cardassia.

735
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:00,333
We have to leave here, Ziyal

736
00:40:00,368 --> 00:40:02,464
before the Federation arrives.

737
00:40:02,507 --> 00:40:04,341
I'm not leaving.

738
00:40:04,377 --> 00:40:06,678
These people are our enemies.

739
00:40:06,717 --> 00:40:08,482
They're not my enemies.

740
00:40:10,024 --> 00:40:11,323
I'm one of them.

741
00:40:11,361 --> 00:40:13,696
That's not true.

742
00:40:13,734 --> 00:40:15,033
Father...

743
00:40:15,069 --> 00:40:16,766
I helped Major Kira

744
00:40:16,808 --> 00:40:20,910
and the others escape
from the holding cells.

745
00:40:23,891 --> 00:40:26,523
Do you know what you're saying?

746
00:40:26,564 --> 00:40:28,831
Yes, I do.

747
00:40:31,743 --> 00:40:33,178
I belong here.

748
00:40:39,863 --> 00:40:41,628
Good-bye, Father.

749
00:40:53,362 --> 00:40:55,162
I love you.

750
00:40:57,972 --> 00:41:00,239
No!

751
00:41:00,345 --> 00:41:01,473
You heard her.

752
00:41:01,514 --> 00:41:02,642
She's a traitor.

753
00:41:04,722 --> 00:41:07,524
Ziyal, it's all right.

754
00:41:07,562 --> 00:41:09,396
It's, it's all right.

755
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:10,401
It's all right.

756
00:41:10,436 --> 00:41:11,530
Ziyal, I forgive you.

757
00:41:11,571 --> 00:41:12,539
It's all right.

758
00:41:12,574 --> 00:41:13,975
We're out of time, sir.

759
00:41:15,581 --> 00:41:16,948
The last ship is waiting for us!

760
00:41:20,192 --> 00:41:23,097
Ziyal, please hear me.

761
00:41:23,133 --> 00:41:24,568
I love you.

762
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:29,438
I love you, Ziyal.

763
00:41:29,481 --> 00:41:31,952
No. No!

764
00:41:40,475 --> 00:41:42,309
Ziyal...

765
00:41:57,649 --> 00:42:00,417
Ah, Jake.

766
00:42:00,456 --> 00:42:02,085
Welcome back, Captain.

767
00:42:02,126 --> 00:42:04,097
Good to see you, Constable.

768
00:42:04,131 --> 00:42:05,965
It's good to see you all.

769
00:42:06,002 --> 00:42:07,471
Captain...

770
00:42:07,506 --> 00:42:09,100
it would appear

771
00:42:09,143 --> 00:42:10,840
I owe you a barrel of bloodwine.

772
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,110
We'll drink it together.

773
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,950
Worf.

774
00:42:13,988 --> 00:42:15,685
Jadzia.

775
00:42:15,725 --> 00:42:17,855
I guess the wedding's still on.

776
00:42:20,136 --> 00:42:21,161
Quark...

777
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:23,200
are the holosuites
still working?

778
00:42:23,244 --> 00:42:24,804
Ready and waiting, Chief.

779
00:42:24,848 --> 00:42:26,477
Julian, did you hear that?

780
00:42:26,518 --> 00:42:27,486
The Battle of Britain...

781
00:42:27,521 --> 00:42:28,922
I'll meet you there in an hour.

782
00:42:28,958 --> 00:42:30,450
You've been promoted?

783
00:42:30,495 --> 00:42:31,794
I'm an engineer.

784
00:42:31,831 --> 00:42:33,893
We'll be working together.

785
00:42:33,936 --> 00:42:35,964
Actually,
you'll be working for me.

786
00:42:38,012 --> 00:42:38,980
Really missed you.

787
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:40,211
It's good to have you back, Dad.

788
00:42:40,251 --> 00:42:41,219
So...

789
00:42:41,254 --> 00:42:42,222
where's Major Kira?

790
00:42:42,256 --> 00:42:44,659
She's in the Infirmary...
with Ziyal.

791
00:42:58,628 --> 00:43:00,622
She loved you.

792
00:43:02,972 --> 00:43:06,036
I could never figure out why.

793
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,620
I guess I never will.

794
00:43:13,464 --> 00:43:16,996
We'll go back to Cardassia,
Ziyal.

795
00:43:19,511 --> 00:43:21,982
We'll be safe there.

796
00:43:22,018 --> 00:43:23,783
You'll live with me...

797
00:43:25,259 --> 00:43:27,959
Maybe Dr. Bashir
can do something for him.

798
00:43:27,999 --> 00:43:30,631
We'll both be
very happy together.

799
00:43:31,807 --> 00:43:34,974
I know you forgive me.

800
00:43:35,016 --> 00:43:38,958
After all, I am your father.

801
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:41,793
And I forgive you...

802
00:43:41,831 --> 00:43:44,531
my precious girl.

803
00:43:44,571 --> 00:43:45,733
Easy.

804
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,853
Easy now.

805
00:44:00,076 --> 00:44:02,776
I forgive you, too.
