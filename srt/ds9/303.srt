1
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,214
(<i> laughing</i> )

2
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,055
Now I know
we're doomed.

3
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:16,600
Why, brother?

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,144
Rule of
Acquisition 286:

5
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:22,105
"When Morn leaves,
it's all over."

6
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:25,275
There is no such rule.

7
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,861
There should be.

8
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:29,070
Oh, I know business is bad,
but that's no reason...

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,406
Bad?<i> Bad?</i>

10
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,367
It's 2100 hours.

11
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,451
The bar's open.

12
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,244
There's a sale on synthehol,

13
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:37,955
and there's
no one here.

14
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,499
You, Ferengi!

15
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:44,003
Another
bloodwine now!

16
00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:45,838
At least someone
is still here.

17
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:46,839
How many has he had?

18
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:49,008
A dozen.

19
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:51,677
I should have gone
into insurance...

20
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:54,304
better hours, more money,
less scruples.

21
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:56,932
It's all Sisko's fault.

22
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:57,933
Sisko?

23
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,393
That's right.

24
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,353
If he'd handled things better
with the Dominion,

25
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:02,730
none of this
would have happened.

26
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,233
They want a foothold
in the Alpha Quadrant.

27
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,151
Cut a deal.
Make a few arrangements.

28
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,862
Give them a little something
for their trouble.

29
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:11,112
Brother?

30
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:13,448
But no! He had
to play it tough.

31
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,492
So now everyone's afraid
of the Dominion.

32
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,827
Yes, but, brother?

33
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,871
And that means fewer
people on the station,

34
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,789
which means fewer
people at Quark's,

35
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,792
which means I am
out of business.

36
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:29,381
Where's my wine, you cowering
little Ferengi slug?

37
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,716
What's the problem?

38
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,384
He says he's out of money.

39
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:33,761
He's asking for credit.

40
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,054
Credit?

41
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:37,681
I'll handle it.

42
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,059
Watch and learn.

43
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,276
My name is Quark.

44
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,987
(<i> growls</i> )

45
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:59,453
I'm... like to discuss, uh,
arranging a line of credit.

46
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,288
(<i> nervous laughter</i> )

47
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:05,417
You dare talk to me like that?

48
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:08,128
You pathetic<i> mak'dar.</i>

49
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,594
(<i> gasps</i> )

50
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,524
(<i> instrument whirring</i> )

51
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,362
(<i> whispered</i>
<i>conversations</i> )

52
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,748
How long are they going
to leave him there?

53
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,167
I wish they would hurry up
and get rid of him.

54
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,045
I wish we could
put him on display.

55
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,504
What?

56
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:57,589
Look at them.

57
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:58,882
They're consumed

58
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,717
with morbid
fascination.

59
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:01,969
They can't wait
to get in here.

60
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,845
They all want to know
what happened.

61
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,639
Was it a bar fight?

62
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,474
What started it?

63
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:11,019
And most of all,
who killed the Klingon?

64
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,188
But no one killed him.
It was an accident.

65
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,564
I killed him in a bar fight.

66
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,607
Wha...?

67
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:16,858
You heard me.

68
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,277
I killed him in self-defense.

69
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:19,694
But where is
the profit in lying

70
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,029
about a simple drunken...?

71
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,739
Look at that crowd.

72
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,158
How long has it been
since you've seen

73
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,951
that many customers
waiting to get in here?

74
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,578
This is an opportunity
to turn everything around.

75
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,414
This is insane, brother.

76
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,374
What if his family comes
looking for the killer?

77
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,751
What if they
want revenge?

78
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,753
If push comes to shove,

79
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,338
we tell the truth
and no harm done.

80
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:41,508
Rom, let me put it
another way.

81
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,678
If business
doesn't improve

82
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,221
I'll have to start making

83
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,891
a few cutbacks
in the operation of my bar,

84
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,894
beginning with... your salary.

85
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,063
How big of a cutback?

86
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,693
I'd probably have
to cut it back to zero.

87
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,111
ODO:
All right, Quark.

88
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,237
Start at the beginning.

89
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,780
My brother fought
a desperate

90
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,532
hand-to-hand battle
with the Klingon

91
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,450
and was forced to kill
in self-defense.

92
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,830
<i>You</i> killed<i> him?</i>

93
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,081
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,708
I couldn't avoid it.

95
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,837
He was abusive...

96
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,131
vulgar.

97
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,675
A typical drunken Klingon.

98
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,010
All that was fine

99
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,385
until it came time
to pay his bill.

100
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:29,514
He refused.
I insisted.

101
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,099
We began to argue.

102
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,433
He pushed me.

103
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,560
(<i> scoffs</i> )

104
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,769
I pushed back.

105
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,063
I was about
to call for security

106
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,731
to throw him
out of my bar

107
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,691
when suddenly,
he pulls a knife on me!

108
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,442
I avoided the first thrust.

109
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,863
He came at me again.

110
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,741
I hit him with a left jab.

111
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,617
There was
a furious exchange of blows.

112
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,869
The next thing I knew

113
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,663
his knife was at my throat.

114
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,165
(<i> crowd gasps</i> )

115
00:06:55,165 --> 00:07:00,962
So, I twisted it
out of his grasp

116
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,007
and plunged it into his chest.

117
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,009
(<i> crowd murmurs excitedly</i> )

118
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,641
I will never forget
the look on his face

119
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,019
when his life
drained away.

120
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:19,564
I'd rather not talk
about this anymore.

121
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,326
Hi, honey.

122
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,994
Hi.

123
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,955
Oh, what a day.

124
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,249
Synthale,
tall glass.

125
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,719
We had three Coverian
freighter captains

126
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,306
all wanting to use
the same docking port.

127
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,224
Someone stole a case
of medical supplies

128
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,852
from the Infirmary--
two power failures.

129
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,401
How was school?

130
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,237
I closed it.

131
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,448
You closed
the school?

132
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:10,573
Well, why?

133
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,992
What happened?

134
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,661
My last two Bajoran
students left today.

135
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,247
Their families
relocated back to Bajor.

136
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:22,336
That left Jake, Nog,
and a lot of empty chairs.

137
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:24,629
Well, what about
Jake and Nog?

138
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,506
Won't they have to...?

139
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,384
I told them I'd be happy
to tutor them from now on.

140
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:32,887
Two students are not
enough to sustain a school.

141
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,231
I'm really sorry, Keiko.

142
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,524
It's not your fault.

143
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,610
Everyone's just afraid
of the Dominion.

144
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,322
People aren't going to be
moving their families

145
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:51,948
to the station anymore.

146
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,326
That means
no more children,

147
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,619
which means
no more school.

148
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,746
Don't look so upset.

149
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,207
It's not like I was planning

150
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,167
to be a teacher
for the rest of my life.

151
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,210
Keiko.

152
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,961
I'm fine, really.

153
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,523
(<i> sighs</i> )

154
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,774
(<i> boisterous conversation</i> )

155
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,198
Don't worry, Constable.

156
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:36,910
I won't be dispatching
any more customers today.

157
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,662
You don't have
to keep an eye on me.

158
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,206
Oh, thank you for putting
my mind at ease,

159
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,291
but I didn't come here
to protect the patrons

160
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,585
from your violent temper.

161
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,337
Then what can I
do for you?

162
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,048
I just thought you'd
like to know who it was

163
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,092
that you killed
in self-defense.

164
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,552
Sure.

165
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:56,763
His name was Kozak,
by all accounts

166
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,223
a thoroughly
disreputable character.

167
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,933
A notorious drunkard.

168
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,851
Well, sounds like
someone who was going

169
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,520
to get himself killed
sooner or later.

170
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,021
It's a shame it had
to happen here.

171
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,940
Hmm, isn't it?

172
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,567
I thought you'd also
like to know

173
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:12,279
that Kozak wasn't just
some drifter passing through.

174
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,198
In fact, he was the head
of a Klingon family

175
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:19,160
a rather powerful family,
from what I can gather.

176
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,790
Now, do you want
to change your story,

177
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,376
or do you want to wait
for Kozak's family

178
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,752
to show up and ask to see

179
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,297
the Ferengi bartender
who killed him?

180
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,633
I told you what
happened, Constable.

181
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,803
Now, either
order something

182
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,347
or make room for
a paying customer.

183
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,933
(<i> sighing</i> )

184
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,440
Brother, didn't you hear
what he said?

185
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,690
I heard him.

186
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,151
Then we have
to tell the truth.

187
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,819
We've made enough profit
in the last few hours

188
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,154
to make up
for the losses we had...

189
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,781
It's not about
profit anymore.

190
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,409
It's about respect.

191
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,202
It is?

192
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,497
You see the way
they look at me now.

193
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:06,541
I'm not just some venal Ferengi
trying to take their money.

194
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:11,754
I'm Quark,
slayer of Klingons.

195
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,174
I've struck a blow
for Ferengi everywhere.

196
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,301
But what about Kozak's family?

197
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,219
What if they come here
for revenge?

198
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,804
<i>If</i> that happens,

199
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:24,392
I'll stand up, look them
straight in the eye,

200
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,269
and offer them a bribe.

201
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,327
You killed my brother.

202
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:52,379
My brother killed
by a miserable Ferengi.

203
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,088
I never would have
believed it possible.

204
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,965
I can explain.

205
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,425
You'd better!

206
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:01,262
I want to know exactly
how Kozak died,

207
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,515
and if I don't like
what I hear...

208
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:05,933
Believe me,
you'll like it.

209
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,726
He was in my bar.

210
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,604
I asked him
to pay his tab.

211
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:10,771
He refused.

212
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,357
I was willing
to let it go at that,

213
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,984
but then, he pulled a knife
and came at me,

214
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,988
and the truth
of the matter is

215
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,367
he was so inebriated
that he just fell...

216
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,661
I hope you're not
going to tell me

217
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,287
that he died
in an accident.

218
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,997
You do?

219
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,459
Yes! Because there would be
no honor in such a death.

220
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,420
And if Kozak died
in disgrace,

221
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,422
then that disgrace
would be passed along

222
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,965
to the rest
of his family.

223
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,759
So if you were
the cause of an accident

224
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,970
that will dishonor
my entire family,

225
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,014
then I'm going
to kill you

226
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,891
and stuff
your miserable corpse

227
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,476
out the nearest airlock.

228
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,561
I see.

229
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:52,105
On the other hand,

230
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:57,985
if he died as a warrior
in personal combat,

231
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,571
then there would
be no dishonor

232
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:00,947
for him or his family.

233
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,950
So what you're saying is

234
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:10,373
if I killed him
in personal combat, that's good.

235
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:11,625
Of course
it isn't good!

236
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,960
He was my brother...

237
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,920
but...

238
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,089
it would be honorable,

239
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:22,969
and an honorable death
requires no vengeance.

240
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,138
Your life would
be spared.

241
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:28,558
I wish you had been there.

242
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:31,227
You would have been proud
of your brother.

243
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,605
He fought a brave
and valiant battle

244
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:34,939
right up to the end.

245
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,066
It was an honor to kill him.

246
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,861
I'm sure it was.

247
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:44,783
Remember that when
you tell your customers

248
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:47,826
about the death of Kozak.

249
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,663
You can count on it.

250
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,292
<i>Qapla'!</i>

251
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,834

(<i> sighs</i> )

253
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,101
What's going on?

254
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,020
You're five minutes early.

255
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,230
The canapés
aren't ready yet.

256
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,191
Have I missed
something?

257
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,359
Now, don't tell me

258
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,486
you've forgotten
what day it is.

259
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,113
Well, it, it's not
our anniversary

260
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,574
or my birthday or...

261
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,535
I can't believe
you've forgotten.

262
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,620
It's "I'm married
to the most wonderful woman

263
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,246
in the galaxy" day.

264
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,207
I marked it
in your calendar.

265
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,126
I don't think I'm too
familiar with that day.

266
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,420
Oh, it's an old
Irish tradition.

267
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,921
Here we go.

268
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,716
-(<i> champagne pops</i> )
-Ooh!

269
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,176
I thought I should
start celebrating it.

270
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,595
Too bad it only
comes once a year.

271
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,097
Well, actually, it's
a very irregular holiday--

272
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,016
crops up all over
the place...

273
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,934
sometimes twice a day.

274
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,895
Really?

275
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,732
What's a traditional
celebration?

276
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,149
Cake?

277
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,359
Mm-mm.

278
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,402
Noisemakers?

279
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,361
Mm-mm.

280
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:04,571
Fireworks?

281
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:07,448
Oh, definitely
fireworks.

282
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,616
(<i> laughing</i> )

283
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,880
I should be finished
the docking inspection

284
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,548
by 1300 hours.

285
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,550
How about lunch
in the Replimat?

286
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,885
Sounds good to me.

287
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,344
It's a date then.

288
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,554
See you later.

289
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:30,805
Hey...

290
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:34,308
just wanted to thank you
for last night.

291
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,727
It was wonderful.

292
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:38,145
You've already thanked me.

293
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,359
Have a good day.

294
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,196
I'll be in Upper Pylon 2
if you need me.

295
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,156
I'll be here.

296
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,718
(<i> door opens</i> )

297
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,470
Who's there?

298
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,972
We're closed.

299
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,266
Are you Quark?

300
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:18,436
That depends on who's asking.

301
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,525
My name is Grilka.

302
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,986
Kozak was my husband.

303
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,990
Oh, uh... well, come in.

304
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,408
Can I get you a drink
or something to eat?

305
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,034
I've been told

306
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,621
that you are the one
who killed my husband.

307
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:39,499
I didn't want to.

308
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,835
I had no choice.

309
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,337
Was it an honorable death?

310
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,422
Absolutely.

311
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:50,468
He died like a warrior.

312
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:53,304
I'm very sorry
this happened.

313
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,097
Is there something
I can do?

314
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,934
Actually, there is.

315
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,354
Defend yourself!

316
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:15,869
So this is the man who killed
my husband in personal combat?

317
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,370
What's this all about?
Who are you?

318
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,915
I already told you.
I'm Kozak's widow.

319
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,876
But first things
first, Quark.

320
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:26,295
I want to know
how my husband died,

321
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,506
and I want the truth.

322
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,924
All right.

323
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:44,939
He was drunk and he did try
to attack me,

324
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:48,234
but he tripped and fell
on his own knife.

325
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:52,697
So you lied to the station
security officer,

326
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:56,576
to your customers,
and to D'Ghor.

327
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,703
You must be quite a liar.

328
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,413
It's a gift.

329
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:05,001
I think it's time you put
that gift to work... for me.

330
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,210
(<i> gasps</i> )

331
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,923
<i>Cho'echu!</i>

332
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,061
What...

333
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,564
What happened?

334
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,190
Where am I?

335
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,319
You are on Kronos.

336
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,738
Kronos...

337
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,448
the Klingon Homeworld.

338
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:39,201
You are in the ancestral home

339
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,538
of what used to be known
as the House of Kozak.

340
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,582
What's it called now?

341
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:51,505
Kozak died without a male heir.

342
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,133
The House no longer has a name.

343
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,135
What about Kozak's brother,
D'Ghor?

344
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,680
<i>Juht!</i> That<i> pahtk's</i> name
is not spoken in this house.

345
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,642
He is no brother to Kozak.

346
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,603
His family has been
a sworn enemy to this House

347
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:06,938
for seven generations.

348
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:09,231
But he came to DS9.
He told me...

349
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,610
What he told you were lies.

350
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,155
He wanted you to say that Kozak
had died in honorable combat

351
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,991
so that no special dispensation

352
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,867
would be granted.

353
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,619
I don't understand.

354
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:27,083
If Kozak had died in an accident
and left no male heir,

355
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,876
the Council might have decided

356
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,838
that this was
an unusual situation

357
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,966
and granted
special dispensation.

358
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:37,259
That might have allowed
Grilka to become

359
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,470
head of the family
even though she's a woman.

360
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:43,141
But if Kozak died
in an honorable fight,

361
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:47,561
was defeated simply
by a better opponent,

362
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:51,357
then no dispensation
would have been granted.

363
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:55,361
And without a male heir,
the House will fall.

364
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,530
That hasn't happened
yet, Tumek,

365
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,448
and there is still time

366
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,867
to prevent it
from ever happening.

367
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:01,868
Put this on.

368
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,077
Why?

369
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:06,205
Because if you do not,
I will kill you.

370
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,915
TUMEK:
I beg you.

371
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,750
Consider what you do here,
mistress.

372
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,085
The decision is made.

373
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,795
There is no other choice.

374
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:19,301
<i>Go'Eveh, lu cha wabeh,</i>
<i>Mo ka re'Chos.</i>

375
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,345
TUMEK:
Repeat my words.

376
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,890
<i>Go'Eveh,</i>

377
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,518
<i>lu cha wabeh,</i>
<i>To va re'Luk.</i>

378
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:28,686
Let me ask just one...

379
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:31,355
Repeat the words.

380
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:37,570
<i>Go'Eveh, lu cha wabeh,</i>
<i>To va re'Luk.</i>

381
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,780
<i>GhoS ma'lu Kah.</i>

382
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,041
It is done.

383
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,625
What's done?

384
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,627
The ceremony is complete.

385
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,880
You are husband and wife.

386
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:12,980
And while you're at it

387
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,815
have Alpha shift begin
a series of battle drills.

388
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,610
I'm not satisfied with their
last performance evaluations.

389
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,653
Right.

390
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,364
Oh, ah, excuse me, sir.
I can come back later.

391
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,950
No, no, no.
We're done here.

392
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,618
What can I
do for you?

393
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:26,994
Well, it's...

394
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,871
it's kind
of private.

395
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:29,997
Wife problems, Chief?

396
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,540
How did you know?

397
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,418
Well, I've been a husband
and I've been a wife,

398
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,754
and I know that look
from both sides.

399
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,131
Come on.

400
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,799
What?

401
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,675
This is where we make
a graceful exit

402
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:45,179
and let the boys talk
amongst themselves.

403
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,014
Must be some kind
of human thing.

404
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,474
Well, I'm sure
the old man

405
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,226
will be happy
to explain it to you

406
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,228
on your way out.

407
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:04,698
Chief.

408
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:16,460
I guess, uh, Keiko
must be very upset

409
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,378
about the school
closing, huh?

410
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,464
Well, that's just it, sir.

411
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,758
She's acting like
she doesn't care,

412
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,593
like there's
nothing wrong.

413
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,637
That sounds bad.

414
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:28,806
I've tried to lift
her spirits a bit--

415
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,141
romantic dinners,

416
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:32,935
long moonlit walks
in the holosuite.

417
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,812
I even rearranged
my work schedule

418
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,647
so I could spend
more time with her.

419
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,899
Nothing seems to
make a difference.

420
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,609
But now you have an idea?

421
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,486
Oh, yes, sir.

422
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,531
Um, I, I'd like
permission to convert

423
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:48,909
one of the empty cargo
bays into an arboretum.

424
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,329
I think Bay 21
would be ideal.

425
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:53,455
The ODN conduits are shot,

426
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,583
and the security system's
never worked anyway.

427
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,170
So you're saying yes?

428
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,838
Ah, sounds like it to me.

429
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,635
Listen...

430
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,137
there's nothing
harder than knowing

431
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,639
that the person you love
is unhappy.

432
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:14,060
And I know how important it is
to do something about it.

433
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,563
If one empty cargo bay
makes Keiko happy,

434
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:20,233
then I'm all for it.

435
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,151
I just hope it works.

436
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,945
So do I.

437
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:28,741
She sacrificed her entire
career to be here with me.

438
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,368
I owe her.

439
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:36,582
If there's anything else
I can do, just let me know.

440
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,211
Thank you, sir.

441
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:53,849
There being no special
circumstances in the death

442
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,310
and no male heir,

443
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,686
I make claim

444
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,437
to the title
and property

445
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,481
of this
fallen House.

446
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:04,610
The Council has considered
your petition

447
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,028
and will grant the transfer

448
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:08,114
once the final rituals
have been...

449
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:10,657
The petition
is out of order.

450
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,410
This woman has
no place here.

451
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,703
Her husband is dead
and her House is fallen.

452
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,622
I ask that she be taken
from the hall!

453
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,499
I have performed
the<i> brek'tal</i> ritual, Gowron,

454
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:20,876
and have chosen

455
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:24,462
a new husband
to lead my House.

456
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:27,758
Enter, husband!

457
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:30,428
<i>( concerned muttering )</i>

458
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,932
A Ferengi cannot be allowed
to rule a Klingon House!

459
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:38,602
All I have done is follow
the<i> brek'tal</i> ritual.

460
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,562
If the leader
of a House

461
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,898
is slain in honorable combat,

462
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:46,568
the victor may be invited
to take his place

463
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,486
and his wife.

464
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:51,615
You are the one that made
this possible, D'Ghor.

465
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,242
You certified
before the Council

466
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,453
that Kozak died
an honorable death

467
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:58,205
at the hands of this man.

468
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:04,837
I am simply exercising
my rights as an honored widow.

469
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:10,343
I<i> will</i> have your House
and your title, Grilka,

470
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:15,055
and when I am done,
I will place your head

471
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:18,267
and the head of this
ridiculous Ferengi

472
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,186
outside the gates.

473
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,313
Uh, can I say
something?

474
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:24,940
It seems there's
some kind of dispute

475
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,817
going on over some land,

476
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,152
maybe some other property...

477
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:30,196
I think maybe we should
consider a deal.

478
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:32,031
I should kill
you right now.

479
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,115
<i>Mev yap!</i>

480
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,578
D'Ghor, you cannot challenge
this man in Council

481
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,706
without just cause.

482
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,125
We will have to consider
this matter carefully

483
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,961
before a final decision
is reached.

484
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:49,756
Until then,
the<i> brek'tal</i> will be respected.

485
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,345
The House of Kozak is gone.

486
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:59,099
For the time being, it will be
known as... as the House of...

487
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,103
Quark.

488
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,022
Quirk.

489
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,482
Quark!

490
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,903
The House of Quark.

491
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:26,419
I told you not
to say anything.

492
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:28,128
I was trying to avoid

493
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:31,340
a lot of unnecessary
bloodshed...

494
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,467
like my own.

495
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:36,929
Just do as I say and there
won't be any bloodshed.

496
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,180
Fine.

497
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,057
What's next?

498
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:49,607
What do we do now?

499
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:51,485
How do we strengthen the
position of your House?

500
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,529
How do we keep D'Ghor from
carrying out his threats?

501
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:54,530
What's the plan?

502
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,697
I'm thinking.

503
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,157
You don't have
a plan, do you?

504
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,742
You're just making
this up as you go along.

505
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,618
I've managed
to get us this far.

506
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:04,415
But you have no idea
where to go from here.

507
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:12,172
Can I make a suggestion?

508
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:16,385
Let's try having a more
equal partnership, shall we?

509
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,265
What do you want?

510
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:25,519
Just tell me
what's going on.

511
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:36,238
Kozak squandered much
of our family's wealth,

512
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,198
incurred several
large gambling debts,

513
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,909
made unwise investments.

514
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,787
As a result, the House has
been weakened severely

515
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,123
in power
and in influence.

516
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:49,168
Much of the debt
is owed to D'Ghor,

517
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:52,338
who is now ready to take
advantage of our weakness.

518
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:55,715
If he can gain title
of our lands and property,

519
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:56,967
his family will become

520
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,969
a very powerful influence
in the Empire.

521
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:02,722
He may even earn
a seat on the Council.

522
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,141
Would it be possible for me

523
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:06,519
to see all the financial
records of your House?

524
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,145
And I mean all of them.

525
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,856
D'Ghor's, too,
if you can arrange it.

526
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,526
Maybe I can find a way
out of this mess.

527
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:16,320
That is not how
we do things here.

528
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,696
We are Klingons.

529
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:21,074
We do not dirty ourselves
with filthy ledgers

530
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,451
looking for some
financial trick.

531
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:25,037
Look, we've been doing
things your way

532
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,205
ever since this started,

533
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,914
and now you've run
out of ideas.

534
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:32,252
So maybe we should try doing
things my way for a change.

535
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,671
It certainly can't hurt

536
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:37,090
to let me look at
some "filthy ledgers."

537
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,482
Good afternoon, Chief.

538
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:55,526
Doctor.

539
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:56,610
<i>Plomeek</i> soup, hot.

540
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,820
Oh, with a touch
of basil.

541
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,500
What do you think?

542
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,589
You're asking<i> my</i> opinion?

543
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,260
An arboretum.
For Keiko, I presume,

544
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,386
to make her a little happier

545
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:23,970
now the school's been
closed down.

546
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,515
It's not just for Keiko.

547
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:30,603
I mean, it'd benefit
the entire station.

548
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:33,689
Do you think
it'll work?

549
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,315
Absolutely...

550
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,067
for about two months.

551
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:38,985
Then you'll be right back
where you started.

552
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,114
Two months?

553
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,532
Well, it's been my experience

554
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,492
that during any
serious disagreement,

555
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:49,496
a smile and sweet words
will buy you two hours,

556
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,373
flowers will buy you a week,

557
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:54,209
an arboretum, well,
that's at least two months.

558
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,628
But in the end,

559
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:58,046
you still have to solve
the underlying problem.

560
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,757
I thought an arboretum

561
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:02,635
would give her a chance
to continue her studies.

562
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:04,803
Help her find something
to do with her time.

563
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:05,971
Like a hobby?

564
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:06,972
Exactly.

565
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,558
Exactly why it won't work.

566
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:13,186
You can't ask her to turn
her profession into a hobby.

567
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,855
Would you be satisfied just
puttering around in a workshop,

568
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,734
building nano-circuit boards
and playing with tricorders?

569
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,986
(<i> softly</i> ):
I suppose not.

570
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,780
You're Chief of Operations,

571
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,365
I'm a doctor,
and Keiko's a botanist,

572
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,826
and until she can
be a botanist again,

573
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:31,455
I'm not sure she's ever
really going to<i> be</i> happy.

574
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,877
QUARK:
Very clever.

575
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:41,965
Very clever,
indeed.

576
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:45,511
D'Ghor has manipulated
your family's holdings,

577
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,846
devalued the lands you hold,

578
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,598
and he is
the principal creditor

579
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,518
on Kozak's outstanding
gambling debts.

580
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:55,437
It's no accident
your family's getting weaker

581
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:57,939
and D'Ghor's family
is getting stronger.

582
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,693
He's been systematically
attacking your family's assets

583
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,569
for over five years now.

584
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:05,322
You mean D'Ghor
has been scheming

585
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:07,658
and plotting like a F...

586
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:10,035
Like a Ferengi.

587
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:13,872
There is no honor
in what he has done.

588
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,208
If he wanted to
challenge my House,

589
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,668
he should have made
a declaration,

590
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:19,211
met our forces
in battle.

591
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,254
And risk destroying

592
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,215
the very thing
he wanted most--

593
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:24,633
your lands
and property?

594
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:31,973
Can you prove
any of this?

595
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,266
You can show
the Council

596
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,934
exactly what
D'Ghor has done?

597
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,478
It's all right there.

598
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:37,896
All I have to do is
talk them through it.

599
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,984
Thank you, Quark.

600
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,153
You may have saved my family.

601
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:50,701
Well, it is the House
of Quark, after all.

602
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:54,287
(<i> both chuckling</i> )

603
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:02,462
I really am very grateful
for all you've done, Quark.

604
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:07,801
That is why I'm going to let
you take your hand off my thigh

605
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:13,223
instead of shattering
every bone in your body.

606
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:15,601
(<i> both laughing</i> )

607
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:21,147
Let's go talk
to the Council.

608
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:26,319
So, as you can see
from the gross adjusted

609
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,364
assets tabulation in Column "J,"

610
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:32,284
the net value
of the land acquisition

611
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,661
was actually zero.

612
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,329
Now, if you go to the file

613
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,790
marked "devaluation
of capital income",

614
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:38,957
we can review
the way D'Ghor...

615
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,501
Enough.

616
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,295
I don't want to hear
anything more

617
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:49,760
about finances, mergers,
or currency transactions.

618
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,348
The charge
has been made

619
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,601
that you have
used<i> money</i>

620
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:59,436
to bring down
a great House.

621
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:01,104
What do you say
to this, D'Ghor?

622
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:04,608
I say that he is a liar.

623
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:08,612
That he has smeared my name,
and I demand vengeance

624
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:10,781
through
personal combat.

625
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:15,702
I have discovered new evidence,

626
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:20,833
evidence which proves
Kozak did not die honorably.

627
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:24,503
That he actually died
in an accident.

628
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:27,714
I have a witness who will say

629
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:32,010
he watched Kozak trip
and fall on his own blade,

630
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,347
and that Quark made up
the entire story.

631
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:38,057
I don't know what
he's trying to pull here.

632
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:41,060
(<i> whispers</i> ):
The only other person
who was there was...

633
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,233
Hello, brother.

634
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,909
QUARK:
Come on, this way.

635
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:58,829
And keep quiet!

636
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:05,752
I thought
you might try to leave.

637
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:10,048
Look, I have done my part
in this little game of yours,

638
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,050
and I am sorry about
your House and title,

639
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,385
but there's
a man out there

640
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,094
that wants
to kill me tomorrow.

641
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,430
It's a matter of honor, Quark.

642
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,308
D'Ghor has accused you of lying.

643
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,686
There's no way
to answer that challenge

644
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:24,563
except through personal combat.

645
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:26,606
To you Klingons
there may be no other way,

646
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,274
but there's
an old Ferengi saying

647
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,819
about discretion being
the better part of valor.

648
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:34,447
Then what they say
about the Ferengi is true.

649
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,784
You're all lying,
thieving cowards,

650
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,495
who have no sense
of loyalty or honor.

651
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,247
Sticks and stones.

652
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:45,208
I thought<i> you</i> were different.

653
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:49,462
I thought you had
something in here.

654
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:54,092
But all you have in there
is a piece of latinum.

655
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,888
And it's a pretty small piece
at that.

656
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:00,807
Let them run.

657
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:04,770
I don't want them in my House.

658
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:07,480
(<i> growling</i> )

659
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:18,575
All right, let's go.

660
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,619
What?

661
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:23,830
What?!

662
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:27,125
You think I should stay
and fight D'Ghor?

663
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,168
Is that what
you're thinking?

664
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,796
How could you let her
get to you like this?

665
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:32,422
Don't you see
what she's trying to do?

666
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:33,715
She's trying to make us
feel guilty.

667
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:34,925
Well, it's not
going to work.

668
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:35,926
You're right, brother.

669
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:37,094
You're a businessman.

670
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:38,136
All you care
about is profit.

671
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,679
Right.

672
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,307
This was all just a ploy
to boost sales at the bar.

673
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:45,310
Who cares if some Klingon
female loses her House?

674
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,311
I certainly don't.

675
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,605
Me neither.

676
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:49,940
Well...

677
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,192
Now, let's get out of here.

678
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,582
GOWRON:
Grilka,

679
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,585
where is the leader
of your House?

680
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,088
I do not know.

681
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:16,091
Then I say
that the House of Quark

682
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:18,844
has dishonored itself
before this Council,

683
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:21,220
and I ask that
it be dissolved

684
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,598
and its land
and property

685
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,892
be turned over to me
as compensation for...

686
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,060
(<i> door opens</i> )

687
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:37,278
I am Quark, son of Keldar,

688
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,072
and I have come to answer

689
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:42,701
the challenge of D'Ghor,

690
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:45,787
son of... whatever.

691
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:51,417
(<i> crowd muttering</i> )

692
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:59,425
Whatever happens,
I am proud of you.

693
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:02,470
I wish I could say
that's comforting.

694
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:09,019
Ready?

695
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:10,520
(<i> grunts</i> )

696
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,480
Ready?

697
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,400
<i>DaH!</i>

698
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,443
(<i> cackling</i> )

699
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,787
Go ahead, kill me.

700
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,749
That is why I'm here,
isn't it--

701
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,000
to be killed?

702
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,752
Well, here I am.

703
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:36,129
So go ahead
and do it.

704
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:37,463
You all want me
to pick up that sword

705
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:38,965
and fight him,
don't you?

706
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,467
But I don't have a chance,
and you know it.

707
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,887
You only want me
to put up a fight

708
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:47,515
so that your precious honor
will be satisfied.

709
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,851
Well, I'm not going to make it

710
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,352
so easy for you.

711
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:58,777
Having me fight D'Ghor

712
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:01,071
is nothing more
than an execution.

713
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:04,657
So, if that's
what you want,

714
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:08,828
that's what you'll get--

715
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,206
an execution.

716
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,415
No honor,

717
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,127
no glory.

718
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:18,379
And when you tell your children
and your grandchildren

719
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:21,216
the glorious story
of how you rose to power

720
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:23,802
and took Grilka's House
from her,

721
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,845
I hope you remember to tell them

722
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:31,851
how you heroically killed
an unarmed Ferengi...

723
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,645
half your size.

724
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:39,151
Whatever you say, Ferengi.

725
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:41,820
D'Ghor! What are
you doing?

726
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,321
I didn't want to
believe the things

727
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,615
he said about
you yesterday,

728
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:47,700
but if you can
stand here

729
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,662
and murder this
pathetic little man,

730
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:53,665
then you have no honor...

731
00:38:56,918 --> 00:39:00,588
and you have no place
in this hall.

732
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,340
(<i> weapon clatters</i>
<i>to the ground</i> )

733
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:22,485
(<i> D'Ghor grunting</i> )

734
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,458
A brave Ferengi.

735
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,252
Who would have

736
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:41,671
thought it possible?

737
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:53,892
I believe there are enough
unusual circumstances here

738
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:57,896
to justify granting you
special dispensation.

739
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:00,982
You can lead your House
on your own,

740
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:05,320
if that is what you want.

741
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:09,407
<i>Yej rhin!</i>

742
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,589
You have given me
back my House

743
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:27,217
and my family name.

744
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:29,177
How can I repay you?

745
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:31,846
I would like
a divorce, please.

746
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,848
No offense.

747
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,935
None taken.

748
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:40,397
I can give it
to you right away.

749
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,691
<i>N'Gos tlhogh cha!</i>

750
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:44,943
(<i> spits</i> )

751
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,697
You're a free man.

752
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,158
A little warning
would've been nice.

753
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,919
<i>Qapla',</i> Quark...

754
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:05,422
son of Keldar.

755
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:08,507
<i>Qapla'</i> to you, too.

756
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:25,442
(<i> laughter</i>
<i>and boisterous conversation)</i>

757
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,697
I've never understood

758
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,783
what people see
in that game.

759
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:36,328
Don't they ever
get sick of it?

760
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,000
Keiko...

761
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,169
there's an agrobiology
expedition

762
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:46,171
leaving for
the Janitza mountains

763
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,631
on Bajor in two weeks.

764
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:50,716
They need
a chief botanist.

765
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,969
I think you could
probably qualify.

766
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:54,095
On Bajor?

767
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,596
That's right.

768
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,890
They've never surveyed
these mountains.

769
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,934
It's a very important
expedition.

770
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:03,188
How long is this expedition
supposed to last?

771
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:05,564
Six months.

772
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:09,986
I can't leave you
and Molly for six months.

773
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,279
You can take Molly with you.

774
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:14,157
I've already checked.
And as for me...

775
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:17,576
well, Bajor's only three
hours away in a runabout.

776
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,744
We can manage.

777
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:24,083
When we moved here,
we made an agreement...

778
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,251
I know.

779
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,336
And I'm not trying

780
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:29,339
to back out
of that agreement.

781
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:31,424
Don't let this business
about the school

782
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:33,259
make you feel guilty, and...

783
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,261
This isn't about guilt.

784
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,389
This is about
you being happy

785
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:39,224
and me knowing
that you're not.

786
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:46,147
I made a promise
to stay with you

787
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:47,606
and make this work.

788
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,941
I know.

789
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,943
But you're a botanist.

790
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,653
That's what
you trained to do.

791
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:55,073
That's what you love.

792
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:58,993
Be a botanist, Keiko.

793
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,538
Be the best damn botanist
in the galaxy.

794
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:18,721
Brother... I haven't had
the chance to tell you,

795
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,265
but in the Great Hall,

796
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:23,642
when you stood there
in front of D'Ghor,

797
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,728
you were magnificent.

798
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,146
I was lucky.

799
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,481
If it didn't work,

800
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:30,108
I didn't have
another card to play.

801
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:32,026
Business is
dropping off again.

802
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,279
Money isn't everything.

803
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:35,821
If father were alive,

804
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,907
he'd wash your mouth
out with galcor.

805
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:39,867
You can't buy
respect, brother,

806
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:42,370
and that's what you
have now-- respect.

807
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,581
After all, that's what you
wanted, isn't it?

808
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:50,753
Respect is good,
but latinum's better.

809
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,172
Tell the story again

810
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,967
about how you stood there
in front of D'Ghor

811
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,343
not knowing whether
you were going to live

812
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,636
to see another day.

813
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,679
Everyone's tired
of hearing it, Rom.

814
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,848
It's not going to boost
business anymore.

815
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:06,727
No, I mean... tell me.

816
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:10,022
<i>I</i> want to
hear it again.

817
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,525
All right, but I'm
taking this time

818
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:14,068
out of your paycheck.

819
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:20,658
Well, when I entered
the Great Hall,

820
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:25,037
the first thing I noticed
was that D'Ghor

821
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:29,542
was about a meter taller
than I remembered...
