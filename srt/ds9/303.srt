1
00:00:11,288 --> 00:00:14,022
Now, I know we're doomed.

2
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:16,465
Why, brother?

3
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:19,873
Rule of Acquisition 286:

4
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,907
"When Morn leaves,
it's all over."

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,050
There is no such rule.

6
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:27,392
There should be.

7
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,902
Oh, I know business is bad,
but that's no reason...

8
00:00:29,936 --> 00:00:31,371
Bad? Bad?

9
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,400
It's 2100 hours.

10
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:35,177
The bar's open.

11
00:00:35,216 --> 00:00:36,914
There's a sale on synthehol

12
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:38,822
and there's no one here.

13
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:41,263
You, Ferengi!

14
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:43,462
Another bloodwine now!

15
00:00:43,504 --> 00:00:46,068
At least someone is still here.

16
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:47,445
How many has he had?

17
00:00:47,482 --> 00:00:48,473
A dozen.

18
00:00:49,821 --> 00:00:52,293
I should have gone
into insurance...

19
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:55,129
better hours, more money,
less scruples.

20
00:00:55,168 --> 00:00:57,139
It's all Sisko's fault.

21
00:00:57,173 --> 00:00:58,665
Sisko?

22
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:00,010
That's right.

23
00:01:00,047 --> 00:01:02,143
If he'd handled things better
with the Dominion

24
00:01:02,186 --> 00:01:03,450
none of this
would have happened.

25
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:05,791
They want a foothold
in the Alpha Quadrant.

26
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:08,803
Cut a deal.
Make a few arrangements.

27
00:01:08,837 --> 00:01:10,740
Give them a little something
for their trouble.

28
00:01:10,775 --> 00:01:11,766
Brother?

29
00:01:11,812 --> 00:01:14,080
But no!
He had to play it tough.

30
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:16,247
So now everyone's afraid
of the Dominion.

31
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,259
Yes, but, brother?

32
00:01:17,292 --> 00:01:19,628
And that means
fewer people on the station

33
00:01:19,665 --> 00:01:21,533
which means
fewer people at Quark's

34
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,635
which means
I am out of business.

35
00:01:24,678 --> 00:01:30,250
Where's my wine, you cowering
little Ferengi slug?

36
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:31,488
What's the problem?

37
00:01:31,529 --> 00:01:33,227
He says he's out of money.

38
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:34,497
He's asking for credit.

39
00:01:34,537 --> 00:01:35,506
Credit?

40
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,069
I'll handle it.

41
00:01:38,113 --> 00:01:40,608
Watch and learn.

42
00:01:47,203 --> 00:01:49,732
My name is Quark.

43
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:59,932
I'm... like to discuss, uh,
arranging a line of credit.

44
00:02:01,775 --> 00:02:05,717
You dare talk to me like that?

45
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,589
You pathetic <i>mak'dar.</i>

46
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,742
How long are they going
to leave him there?

47
00:04:48,784 --> 00:04:51,690
I wish they would hurry up
and get rid of him.

48
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:53,959
I wish we could
put him on display.

49
00:04:53,998 --> 00:04:55,558
What?

50
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:56,900
Look at them.

51
00:04:56,938 --> 00:05:00,379
They're consumed
with morbid fascination.

52
00:05:00,414 --> 00:05:01,542
They can't wait to get in here.

53
00:05:01,584 --> 00:05:02,883
They all want to know
what happened.

54
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:04,721
Was it a bar fight?

55
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,389
What started it?

56
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,133
And most of all,
who killed the Klingon?

57
00:05:10,172 --> 00:05:12,200
But no one killed him.
It was an accident.

58
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,771
I killed him in a bar fight.

59
00:05:13,815 --> 00:05:14,784
Wha?

60
00:05:14,818 --> 00:05:15,787
You heard me.

61
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:17,485
I killed him in self-defense.

62
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,516
But where is the profit

63
00:05:18,561 --> 00:05:20,087
in lying
about a simple drunken?

64
00:05:20,132 --> 00:05:21,898
Look at that crowd.

65
00:05:21,936 --> 00:05:23,371
How long has it been
since you've seen

66
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,105
that many customers
waiting to get in here?

67
00:05:25,145 --> 00:05:27,617
This is an opportunity
to turn everything around.

68
00:05:27,651 --> 00:05:29,987
This is insane, brother.

69
00:05:30,024 --> 00:05:32,519
What if his family comes
looking for the killer?

70
00:05:32,564 --> 00:05:34,330
What if they want revenge?

71
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:36,101
If push comes to shove

72
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,408
we tell the truth
and no harm done.

73
00:05:38,446 --> 00:05:40,884
Rom, let me put it another way.

74
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:45,557
If business doesn't improve,
I'll have to start making

75
00:05:45,598 --> 00:05:49,267
a few cutbacks
in the operation of my bar

76
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:52,042
beginning with... your salary.

77
00:05:52,081 --> 00:05:54,211
How big of a cutback?

78
00:05:55,657 --> 00:05:58,152
I'd probably have
to cut it back to zero.

79
00:05:58,197 --> 00:06:00,191
All right, Quark.

80
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:01,364
Start at the beginning.

81
00:06:01,405 --> 00:06:02,772
My brother fought a desperate

82
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,576
hand-to-hand battle
with the Klingon

83
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,585
and was forced to kill
in self-defense.

84
00:06:08,524 --> 00:06:11,019
You killed him?

85
00:06:11,131 --> 00:06:12,225
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:12,268 --> 00:06:13,898
I couldn't avoid it.

87
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:18,007
He was abusive...

88
00:06:18,049 --> 00:06:20,283
vulgar.

89
00:06:20,322 --> 00:06:22,726
A typical drunken Klingon.

90
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:24,230
All that was fine

91
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:26,703
until it came time
to pay his bill.

92
00:06:26,738 --> 00:06:28,606
He refused.
I insisted.

93
00:06:28,643 --> 00:06:30,078
We began to argue.

94
00:06:30,147 --> 00:06:31,616
He pushed me.

95
00:06:32,921 --> 00:06:33,890
I pushed back.

96
00:06:33,923 --> 00:06:35,358
I was about
to call for security

97
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,989
to throw him out of my bar

98
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:38,763
when suddenly,
he pulls a knife on me!

99
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:40,706
I avoided the first thrust.

100
00:06:40,741 --> 00:06:43,909
He came at me again.

101
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:46,889
I hit him with a left jab.

102
00:06:46,924 --> 00:06:48,758
There was
a furious exchange of blows.

103
00:06:48,795 --> 00:06:50,128
The next thing I knew

104
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:53,001
his knife was at my throat.

105
00:06:54,443 --> 00:07:00,049
So, I twisted it
out of his grasp

106
00:07:00,091 --> 00:07:03,293
and plunged it into his chest.

107
00:07:09,682 --> 00:07:13,088
I will never forget
the look on his face

108
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,461
when his life drained away.

109
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:18,962
I'd rather not talk
about this anymore.

110
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:30,602
Hi, honey.

111
00:07:30,637 --> 00:07:32,369
Hi.

112
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:34,403
Oh, what a day.

113
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:36,749
Synthale, tall glass.

114
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:49,042
We had three Coverian
freighter captains

115
00:07:49,085 --> 00:07:51,649
all wanting to use
the same docking port.

116
00:07:51,692 --> 00:07:54,221
Someone stole a case
of medical supplies

117
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,735
from the Infirmary.

118
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:57,261
Two power failures.

119
00:08:01,284 --> 00:08:03,654
How was school?

120
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,664
I closed it.

121
00:08:06,697 --> 00:08:08,725
You closed the school?

122
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,069
Well, why?

123
00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:11,405
What happened?

124
00:08:11,443 --> 00:08:14,679
My last two Bajoran
students left today.

125
00:08:14,718 --> 00:08:17,886
Their families
relocated back to Bajor.

126
00:08:17,926 --> 00:08:21,698
That left Jake, Nog
and a lot of empty chairs.

127
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:24,174
Well, what about Jake and Nog?

128
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:25,873
Won't they have to?

129
00:08:25,914 --> 00:08:29,150
I told them I'd be happy
to tutor them from now on.

130
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:32,322
Two students are not
enough to sustain a school.

131
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,648
I'm really sorry, Keiko.

132
00:08:42,691 --> 00:08:44,160
It's not your fault.

133
00:08:44,194 --> 00:08:46,996
Everyone's just afraid
of the Dominion.

134
00:08:47,036 --> 00:08:50,272
People aren't going to be
moving their families

135
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,178
to the station anymore.

136
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:54,118
That means no more children

137
00:08:54,154 --> 00:08:56,125
which means no more school.

138
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:58,187
Don't look so upset.

139
00:08:58,231 --> 00:09:00,031
It's not like I was planning

140
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,700
to be a teacher
for the rest of my life.

141
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,709
Keiko.

142
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:04,407
I'm fine, really.

143
00:09:30,983 --> 00:09:32,954
Don't worry, Constable.

144
00:09:32,988 --> 00:09:36,521
I won't be dispatching
any more customers today.

145
00:09:36,564 --> 00:09:39,196
You don't have
to keep an eye on me.

146
00:09:39,237 --> 00:09:41,265
Oh, thank you for putting
my mind at ease

147
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,544
but I didn't come here
to protect the patrons

148
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:45,212
from your violent temper.

149
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:46,917
Then what can I do for you?

150
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,760
I just thought you'd
like to know who it was

151
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,997
that you killed in self-defense.

152
00:09:52,038 --> 00:09:53,507
Sure.

153
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:56,379
His name was Kozak,
by all accounts

154
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,885
a thoroughly
disreputable character.

155
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,549
A notorious drunkard.

156
00:09:59,591 --> 00:10:01,687
Well, sounds like someone
who was going

157
00:10:01,729 --> 00:10:03,255
to get himself killed
sooner or later.

158
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,769
It's a shame it had
to happen here.

159
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,570
Hmm, isn't it?

160
00:10:06,609 --> 00:10:08,808
I thought you'd also
like to know

161
00:10:08,848 --> 00:10:11,981
that Kozak wasn't just
some drifter passing through.

162
00:10:12,023 --> 00:10:14,791
In fact, he was the head
of a Klingon family

163
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:18,738
a rather powerful family,
from what I can gather.

164
00:10:18,773 --> 00:10:23,308
Now, do you want
to change your story

165
00:10:23,352 --> 00:10:25,916
or do you want to wait
for Kozak's family

166
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,485
to show up and ask to see

167
00:10:27,597 --> 00:10:29,933
the Ferengi bartender
who killed him?

168
00:10:29,969 --> 00:10:33,239
I told you what happened,
Constable.

169
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:35,682
Now, either order something

170
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,954
or make room
for a paying customer.

171
00:10:46,244 --> 00:10:48,044
Brother, didn't you hear
what he said?

172
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,279
I heard him.

173
00:10:49,319 --> 00:10:50,515
Then we have
to tell the truth.

174
00:10:50,556 --> 00:10:52,390
We've made enough profit
in the last few hours

175
00:10:52,427 --> 00:10:53,953
to make up
for the losses we had...

176
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:56,471
It's not about profit anymore.

177
00:10:56,505 --> 00:10:59,069
It's about respect.

178
00:10:59,112 --> 00:11:00,912
It is?

179
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,711
You see the way
they look at me now.

180
00:11:02,844 --> 00:11:05,612
I'm not just some venal Ferengi
trying to take their money.

181
00:11:05,651 --> 00:11:10,426
I'm Quark, slayer
of Klingons.

182
00:11:10,464 --> 00:11:13,302
I've struck a blow
for Ferengi everywhere.

183
00:11:13,338 --> 00:11:15,332
But what about Kozak's family?

184
00:11:15,377 --> 00:11:17,576
What if they come here
for revenge?

185
00:11:17,615 --> 00:11:18,914
If that happens

186
00:11:18,953 --> 00:11:23,420
I'll stand up, look them
straight in the eye

187
00:11:23,464 --> 00:11:25,492
and offer them a bribe.

188
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,408
You killed my brother.

189
00:11:47,226 --> 00:11:51,293
My brother killed
by a miserable Ferengi.

190
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,204
I never would have
believed it possible.

191
00:11:53,241 --> 00:11:54,939
I can explain.

192
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:56,643
You'd better!

193
00:11:56,684 --> 00:11:59,817
I want to know
exactly how Kozak died

194
00:11:59,859 --> 00:12:02,731
and if I don't like
what I hear...

195
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:05,001
Believe me, you'll like it.

196
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:06,736
He was in my bar.

197
00:12:06,777 --> 00:12:08,805
I asked him to pay his tab.

198
00:12:08,848 --> 00:12:10,374
He refused.

199
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,915
I was willing
to let it go at that

200
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,934
but then, he pulled a knife
and came at me

201
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,167
and the truth
of the matter is

202
00:12:18,206 --> 00:12:21,339
he was so inebriated
that he just fell...

203
00:12:21,381 --> 00:12:23,979
I hope you're not
going to tell me

204
00:12:24,022 --> 00:12:25,457
that he died in an accident.

205
00:12:25,492 --> 00:12:27,292
You do?

206
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,634
Yes! Because there would be
no honor in such a death.

207
00:12:30,672 --> 00:12:32,609
And if Kozak died in disgrace

208
00:12:32,643 --> 00:12:35,411
then that disgrace
would be passed along

209
00:12:35,451 --> 00:12:37,183
to the rest of his family.

210
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,889
So if you were
the cause of an accident

211
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:42,333
that will dishonor
my entire family

212
00:12:42,369 --> 00:12:44,033
then I'm going to kill you

213
00:12:44,074 --> 00:12:47,777
and stuff your miserable corpse
out the nearest airlock.

214
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:48,786
I see.

215
00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:50,551
On the other hand

216
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:57,234
if he died as a warrior
in personal combat

217
00:12:57,275 --> 00:13:00,181
then there would be no dishonor
for him or his family.

218
00:13:00,215 --> 00:13:03,053
So what you're saying is

219
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:09,596
if I killed him
in personal combat, that's good.

220
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:10,903
Of course it isn't good!

221
00:13:10,943 --> 00:13:13,107
He was my brother...

222
00:13:13,182 --> 00:13:15,119
but...

223
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:17,124
it would be honorable

224
00:13:17,192 --> 00:13:22,331
and an honorable death
requires no vengeance.

225
00:13:22,373 --> 00:13:24,344
Your life would be spared.

226
00:13:24,378 --> 00:13:26,372
I wish you had been there.

227
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:29,686
You would have been proud
of your brother.

228
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,357
He fought a brave
and valiant battle

229
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,165
right up to the end.

230
00:13:34,204 --> 00:13:36,403
It was an honor to kill him.

231
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:39,176
I'm sure it was.

232
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:44,127
Remember that
when you tell your customers

233
00:13:44,163 --> 00:13:47,103
about the death of Kozak.

234
00:13:47,137 --> 00:13:49,005
You can count on it.

235
00:13:52,685 --> 00:13:53,654
<i>Qapla'!</i>

236
00:14:10,163 --> 00:14:11,359
What's going on?

237
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,337
You're five minutes early.

238
00:14:13,372 --> 00:14:15,536
The canapés aren't ready yet.

239
00:14:15,578 --> 00:14:17,378
Have I missed something?

240
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:21,222
Now, don't tell me
you've forgotten what day it is.

241
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:23,355
Well, it, it's not
our anniversary

242
00:14:23,398 --> 00:14:26,098
or my birthday or...

243
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:27,803
I can't believe
you've forgotten.

244
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:29,972
It's "I'm married
to the most wonderful woman

245
00:14:30,015 --> 00:14:31,507
in the galaxy" day.

246
00:14:31,552 --> 00:14:33,420
I marked it in your calendar.

247
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:36,488
I don't think I'm too familiar
with that day.

248
00:14:36,532 --> 00:14:38,662
Oh, it's an old Irish tradition.

249
00:14:38,705 --> 00:14:41,007
Here we go.

250
00:14:42,013 --> 00:14:43,175
Ooh!

251
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,278
I thought I should
start celebrating it.

252
00:14:45,355 --> 00:14:47,155
Too bad it only
comes once a year.

253
00:14:47,193 --> 00:14:49,427
Well, actually, it's
a very irregular holiday...

254
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:51,300
crops up all over the place...

255
00:14:51,371 --> 00:14:53,274
sometimes twice a day.

256
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,109
Really?

257
00:14:55,147 --> 00:14:58,121
What's a traditional
celebration?

258
00:14:58,155 --> 00:14:59,647
Cake?

259
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:00,820
Mm-mm.

260
00:15:00,862 --> 00:15:01,922
Noisemakers?

261
00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:03,127
Mm-mm.

262
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:04,159
Fireworks?

263
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,698
Oh, definitely fireworks.

264
00:15:19,242 --> 00:15:21,304
I should be finished
the docking inspection

265
00:15:21,382 --> 00:15:22,783
by 1300 hours.

266
00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:24,949
How about lunch
in the Replimat?

267
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,290
Sounds good to me.

268
00:15:26,328 --> 00:15:27,627
It's a date then.

269
00:15:27,665 --> 00:15:28,964
See you later.

270
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:30,300
Hey...

271
00:15:30,338 --> 00:15:33,574
just wanted to thank you
for last night.

272
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:35,243
It was wonderful.

273
00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:37,722
You've already thanked me.

274
00:15:42,102 --> 00:15:43,571
Have a good day.

275
00:15:43,606 --> 00:15:46,739
I'll be in Upper Pylon 2
if you need me.

276
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,614
I'll be here.

277
00:16:08,304 --> 00:16:10,070
Who's there?

278
00:16:10,108 --> 00:16:12,512
We're closed.

279
00:16:12,548 --> 00:16:14,850
Are you Quark?

280
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:17,986
That depends on who's asking.

281
00:16:21,236 --> 00:16:24,108
My name is Grilka.

282
00:16:24,144 --> 00:16:26,514
Kozak was my husband.

283
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:30,550
Oh, uh... well, come in.

284
00:16:30,594 --> 00:16:32,063
Can I get you a drink
or something to eat?

285
00:16:32,099 --> 00:16:33,398
I've been told

286
00:16:33,435 --> 00:16:36,169
that you are the one
who killed my husband.

287
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:38,875
I didn't want to.

288
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,445
I had no choice.

289
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,894
Was it an honorable death?

290
00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:45,832
Absolutely.

291
00:16:45,868 --> 00:16:49,935
He died like a warrior.

292
00:16:49,978 --> 00:16:52,780
I'm very sorry this happened.

293
00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:55,691
Is there something I can do?

294
00:16:55,727 --> 00:16:57,664
Actually, there is.

295
00:16:58,701 --> 00:17:00,969
Defend yourself!

296
00:17:10,098 --> 00:17:15,568
So this is the man who killed
my husband in personal combat.

297
00:17:15,611 --> 00:17:16,739
What's this all about?
Who are you?

298
00:17:16,781 --> 00:17:17,841
I already told you.

299
00:17:17,884 --> 00:17:22,487
I'm Kozak's widow,
but first things first, Quark.

300
00:17:22,596 --> 00:17:25,900
I want to know
how my husband died

301
00:17:25,938 --> 00:17:28,034
and I want the truth.

302
00:17:28,077 --> 00:17:29,775
All right.

303
00:17:38,236 --> 00:17:44,651
He was drunk and he did try
to attack me

304
00:17:44,687 --> 00:17:48,025
but he tripped and fell
on his own knife.

305
00:17:48,062 --> 00:17:52,733
So you lied to the station
security officer

306
00:17:52,775 --> 00:17:56,181
to your customers,
and to D'Ghor.

307
00:17:56,217 --> 00:17:58,416
You must be quite a liar.

308
00:17:58,456 --> 00:18:00,086
It's a gift.

309
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:04,227
I think it's time you put
that gift to work... for me.

310
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,028
<i>Cho'echu!</i>

311
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:22,129
What...

312
00:18:23,344 --> 00:18:25,782
What happened?

313
00:18:25,816 --> 00:18:27,411
Where am I?

314
00:18:29,727 --> 00:18:31,561
You are on Kronos.

315
00:18:31,598 --> 00:18:32,931
Kronos...

316
00:18:32,968 --> 00:18:34,632
the Klingon Homeworld.

317
00:18:34,673 --> 00:18:37,441
You are in the ancestral home

318
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,821
of what used to be known
as the House of Kozak.

319
00:18:41,858 --> 00:18:43,795
What's it called now?

320
00:18:46,336 --> 00:18:49,903
Kozak died without a male heir.

321
00:18:49,945 --> 00:18:53,546
The House no longer has a name.

322
00:18:53,588 --> 00:18:55,388
What about Kozak's brother,
D'Ghor?

323
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:58,891
<i>Juht!</i> That <i>pahtk's</i> name
is not spoken in this house.

324
00:18:58,935 --> 00:19:00,963
He is no brother to Kozak.

325
00:19:01,008 --> 00:19:04,575
His family has been
a sworn enemy to this House

326
00:19:04,616 --> 00:19:06,314
for seven generations.

327
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,052
But he came to DS9.

328
00:19:08,092 --> 00:19:09,391
He told me...

329
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:11,628
What he told you were lies.

330
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:15,202
He wanted you to say that Kozak
had died in honorable combat

331
00:19:15,244 --> 00:19:19,050
so that no special dispensation
would be granted.

332
00:19:19,088 --> 00:19:20,956
I don't understand.

333
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:25,961
If Kozak had died in an accident
and left no male heir

334
00:19:26,006 --> 00:19:28,068
the Council might have decided

335
00:19:28,111 --> 00:19:31,108
that this was
an unusual situation

336
00:19:31,152 --> 00:19:34,126
and granted
special dispensation.

337
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,655
That might have allowed
Grilka to become

338
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,899
head of the family,
even though she's a woman

339
00:19:38,939 --> 00:19:42,642
but if Kozak died
in an honorable fight

340
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:46,488
was defeated simply
by a better opponent

341
00:19:46,525 --> 00:19:50,798
then no dispensation
would have been granted

342
00:19:50,836 --> 00:19:54,778
and without a male heir,
the House will fall.

343
00:19:54,814 --> 00:19:58,220
That hasn't happened yet, Tumek,
and there is still time

344
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:00,522
to prevent it
from ever happening.

345
00:20:00,562 --> 00:20:01,690
Put this on.

346
00:20:01,732 --> 00:20:03,031
Why?

347
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:05,701
Because if you do not,
I will kill you.

348
00:20:05,742 --> 00:20:07,372
I beg you.

349
00:20:07,413 --> 00:20:09,145
Consider what you do here,
mistress.

350
00:20:09,185 --> 00:20:10,586
The decision is made.

351
00:20:10,622 --> 00:20:12,354
There is no other choice.

352
00:20:14,766 --> 00:20:19,437
<i>Go'Eveh, lu cha wabeh,</i>
<i>Mo ka re'Chos.</i>

353
00:20:19,478 --> 00:20:23,420
Repeat my words.

354
00:20:23,454 --> 00:20:25,926
<i>Go'Eveh, lu cha wabeh,</i>
<i>To va re'Luk.</i>

355
00:20:25,961 --> 00:20:28,763
Let me ask just one...

356
00:20:28,802 --> 00:20:31,001
Repeat the words.

357
00:20:31,042 --> 00:20:36,991
<i>Go'Eveh, lu cha wabeh,</i>
<i>To va re'Luk.</i>

358
00:20:37,023 --> 00:20:39,153
<i>GhoS ma'lu Kah.</i>

359
00:20:47,451 --> 00:20:49,513
It is done.

360
00:20:49,556 --> 00:20:51,048
What's done?

361
00:20:51,094 --> 00:20:53,190
The ceremony is complete.

362
00:20:53,232 --> 00:20:55,362
You are husband and wife.

363
00:21:11,078 --> 00:21:12,138
And while you're at it

364
00:21:12,181 --> 00:21:14,015
have Alpha shift begin
a series of battle drills.

365
00:21:14,052 --> 00:21:16,354
I'm not satisfied with their
last performance evaluations.

366
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:18,362
Right.

367
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,831
Oh, ah, excuse me, sir.

368
00:21:19,868 --> 00:21:21,498
I can come back later.

369
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,373
No, no, no.
We're done here.

370
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,845
What can I do for you?

371
00:21:24,881 --> 00:21:26,511
Well, it's...

372
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:28,182
it's kind of private.

373
00:21:28,223 --> 00:21:29,590
Wife problems, Chief?

374
00:21:29,626 --> 00:21:31,221
How did you know?

375
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,828
Well, I've been a husband
and I've been a wife

376
00:21:33,871 --> 00:21:36,241
and I know that look
from both sides.

377
00:21:36,277 --> 00:21:37,746
Come on.

378
00:21:37,781 --> 00:21:39,376
What?

379
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:42,017
This is where we make
a graceful exit

380
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:44,623
and let the boys talk
amongst themselves.

381
00:21:44,665 --> 00:21:46,727
Must be some kind
of human thing.

382
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,673
Well, I'm sure the old man

383
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,840
will be happy
to explain it to you

384
00:21:50,882 --> 00:21:52,351
on your way out.

385
00:22:02,812 --> 00:22:04,612
Chief.

386
00:22:12,772 --> 00:22:16,042
I guess, uh, Keiko
must be very upset

387
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,017
about the school closing, huh?

388
00:22:18,052 --> 00:22:20,182
Well, that's just it, sir.

389
00:22:20,224 --> 00:22:22,388
She's acting
like she doesn't care

390
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,128
like there's nothing wrong.

391
00:22:24,168 --> 00:22:26,298
That sounds bad.

392
00:22:26,341 --> 00:22:28,403
I've tried to lift
her spirits a bit...

393
00:22:28,446 --> 00:22:29,676
romantic dinners

394
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:31,915
long moonlit walks
in the holosuite.

395
00:22:31,955 --> 00:22:34,017
I even rearranged
my work schedule

396
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,259
so I could spend
more time with her.

397
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,464
Nothing seems
to make a difference.

398
00:22:38,505 --> 00:22:40,271
But now you have an idea?

399
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,213
Oh, yes, sir.

400
00:22:42,248 --> 00:22:45,815
Um, I, I'd like permission
to convert

401
00:22:45,858 --> 00:22:48,456
one of the empty cargo
bays into an arboretum.

402
00:22:48,498 --> 00:22:50,732
I think Bay 21 would be ideal.

403
00:22:50,771 --> 00:22:52,765
The ODN conduits are shot

404
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:56,342
and the security system's
never worked anyway.

405
00:22:56,385 --> 00:22:58,789
So you're saying yes?

406
00:22:58,825 --> 00:23:00,455
Ah, sounds like it to me.

407
00:23:04,138 --> 00:23:06,268
Listen...

408
00:23:06,311 --> 00:23:08,510
there's nothing
harder than knowing

409
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,852
that the person you love
is unhappy.

410
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:14,387
And I know how important it is
to do something about it.

411
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,270
If one empty cargo bay
makes Keiko happy

412
00:23:17,306 --> 00:23:19,470
then I'm all for it.

413
00:23:19,512 --> 00:23:21,780
I just hope it works.

414
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,415
So do I.

415
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:28,195
She sacrificed her entire career
to be here with me.

416
00:23:28,235 --> 00:23:30,069
I owe her.

417
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:36,248
If there's anything else
I can do, just let me know.

418
00:23:38,427 --> 00:23:40,421
Thank you, sir.

419
00:23:50,158 --> 00:23:54,100
There being no special
circumstances in the death

420
00:23:54,135 --> 00:23:55,765
and no male heir

421
00:23:55,806 --> 00:23:57,436
I make claim

422
00:23:57,476 --> 00:24:01,282
to the title and property
of this fallen House.

423
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,758
The Council has considered
your petition

424
00:24:03,793 --> 00:24:05,593
and will grant the transfer

425
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:07,865
once the final rituals
have been...

426
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,898
The petition is out of order.

427
00:24:09,942 --> 00:24:11,708
This woman has no place here.

428
00:24:11,747 --> 00:24:14,549
Her husband is dead
and her House is fallen.

429
00:24:14,588 --> 00:24:16,491
I ask that she be taken
from the hall...

430
00:24:16,526 --> 00:24:19,294
I have performed
the <i>brek'tal</i> ritual, Gowron

431
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:24,301
and have chosen
a new husband to lead my House.

432
00:24:24,346 --> 00:24:27,514
Enter, husband!

433
00:24:31,699 --> 00:24:34,798
A Ferengi cannot be allowed
to rule a Klingon House!

434
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,407
All I have done is follow
the <i>brek'tal</i> ritual.

435
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:42,689
If the leader of a House
is slain in honorable combat

436
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:46,602
the victor may be invited
to take his place

437
00:24:46,638 --> 00:24:48,438
and his wife.

438
00:24:48,476 --> 00:24:51,541
You are the one that made
this possible, D'Ghor.

439
00:24:51,584 --> 00:24:54,352
You certified before the Council

440
00:24:54,391 --> 00:24:57,422
that Kozak died
an honorable death

441
00:24:57,466 --> 00:24:59,734
at the hands of this man.

442
00:24:59,805 --> 00:25:04,187
I am simply exercising
my rights as an honored widow.

443
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,957
I will have your House
and your title, Grilka

444
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,444
and when I am done,
I will place your head

445
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:17,615
and the head
of this ridiculous Ferengi

446
00:25:17,655 --> 00:25:19,683
outside the gates.

447
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,664
Uh, can I say something?

448
00:25:21,699 --> 00:25:24,228
It seems there's
some kind of dispute

449
00:25:24,306 --> 00:25:27,610
going on over some land,
maybe some other property...

450
00:25:27,647 --> 00:25:29,641
I think maybe we should
consider a deal.

451
00:25:29,687 --> 00:25:31,419
I should kill you right now.

452
00:25:31,457 --> 00:25:32,356
<i>Mev yap!</i>

453
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,436
D'Ghor, you cannot challenge
this man in Council

454
00:25:38,476 --> 00:25:40,036
without just cause.

455
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,418
We will have to consider
this matter carefully

456
00:25:43,456 --> 00:25:45,951
before a final decision
is reached.

457
00:25:45,995 --> 00:25:49,163
Until then,
the <i>brek'tal</i> will be respected.

458
00:25:51,142 --> 00:25:54,048
The House of Kozak is gone.

459
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:58,459
For the time being, it will be
known as... as the House of...

460
00:26:01,135 --> 00:26:02,570
Quark.

461
00:26:02,605 --> 00:26:04,473
Quirk.

462
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,911
Quark!

463
00:26:07,785 --> 00:26:10,314
The House of Quark.

464
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:25,960
I told you not to say anything.

465
00:26:25,999 --> 00:26:30,808
I was trying to avoid a lot
of unnecessary bloodshed...

466
00:26:30,845 --> 00:26:33,283
like my own.

467
00:26:33,318 --> 00:26:36,520
Just do as I say and there
won't be any bloodshed.

468
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:37,687
Fine.

469
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,597
What's next?

470
00:26:47,087 --> 00:26:48,887
What do we do now?

471
00:26:48,925 --> 00:26:50,896
How do we strengthen
the position of your House?

472
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:53,129
How do we keep D'Ghor
from carrying out his threats?

473
00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:54,138
What's the plan?

474
00:26:54,172 --> 00:26:55,141
I'm thinking.

475
00:26:55,174 --> 00:26:56,370
You don't have a plan, do you?

476
00:26:56,411 --> 00:26:58,245
You're just making
this up as you go along.

477
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,186
I've managed to get us this far.

478
00:27:00,221 --> 00:27:03,924
But you have no idea
where to go from here.

479
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:11,247
Can I make a suggestion?

480
00:27:11,283 --> 00:27:16,058
Let's try having a more
equal partnership, shall we?

481
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:20,867
What do you want?

482
00:27:20,908 --> 00:27:25,079
Just tell me what's going on.

483
00:27:31,602 --> 00:27:34,940
Kozak squandered much
of our family's wealth

484
00:27:34,978 --> 00:27:37,780
incurred several
large gambling debts

485
00:27:37,818 --> 00:27:39,686
made unwise investments.

486
00:27:39,723 --> 00:27:43,426
As a result, the House has
been weakened severely

487
00:27:43,466 --> 00:27:45,836
in power and in influence.

488
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:48,641
Much of the debt
is owed to D'Ghor

489
00:27:48,681 --> 00:27:51,780
who is now ready to take
advantage of our weakness.

490
00:27:51,822 --> 00:27:55,320
If he can gain title
of our lands and property

491
00:27:55,364 --> 00:27:56,959
his family will become

492
00:27:57,002 --> 00:27:59,497
a very powerful influence
in the Empire.

493
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:02,242
He may even earn
a seat on the Council.

494
00:28:02,282 --> 00:28:03,912
Would it be possible for me

495
00:28:03,953 --> 00:28:06,721
to see all the financial
records of your House

496
00:28:06,761 --> 00:28:08,391
and I mean all of them?

497
00:28:08,431 --> 00:28:10,595
D'Ghor's, too,
if you can arrange it.

498
00:28:10,637 --> 00:28:13,166
Maybe I can find a way
out of this mess.

499
00:28:13,211 --> 00:28:15,809
That is not
how we do things here.

500
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:17,377
We are Klingons.

501
00:28:17,422 --> 00:28:20,088
We do not dirty ourselves
with filthy ledgers

502
00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:22,225
looking
for some financial trick.

503
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:24,637
Look, we've been doing
things your way

504
00:28:24,673 --> 00:28:28,206
ever since this started
and now you've run out of ideas.

505
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,950
So maybe we should try doing
things my way for a change.

506
00:28:32,427 --> 00:28:33,953
It certainly can't hurt

507
00:28:33,998 --> 00:28:36,732
to let me look
at some "filthy ledgers."

508
00:28:51,577 --> 00:28:53,137
Good afternoon, Chief.

509
00:28:53,181 --> 00:28:55,084
Doctor.

510
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,679
<i>Plomeek</i> soup, hot.

511
00:28:56,723 --> 00:28:58,489
Oh, with a touch of basil.

512
00:29:09,356 --> 00:29:11,020
What do you think?

513
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,102
You're asking my opinion?

514
00:29:18,513 --> 00:29:20,781
An arboretum.
For Keiko, I presume

515
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:22,449
to make her a little happier

516
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,484
now the school's
been closed down.

517
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,763
It's not just for Keiko.

518
00:29:26,801 --> 00:29:30,139
I mean, it'd benefit
the entire station.

519
00:29:31,915 --> 00:29:33,214
Do you think it'll work?

520
00:29:33,252 --> 00:29:34,882
Absolutely...

521
00:29:34,922 --> 00:29:36,118
for about two months.

522
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,757
Then you'll be right back
where you started.

523
00:29:39,835 --> 00:29:41,897
Two months?

524
00:29:41,941 --> 00:29:43,376
Well, it's been my experience

525
00:29:43,411 --> 00:29:44,937
that during any
serious disagreement

526
00:29:44,982 --> 00:29:47,979
a smile and sweet words
will buy you two hours

527
00:29:48,023 --> 00:29:51,225
flowers will buy you a week

528
00:29:51,264 --> 00:29:54,032
an arboretum, well,
that's at least two months.

529
00:29:54,072 --> 00:29:55,564
But, in the end

530
00:29:55,609 --> 00:29:57,773
you still have to solve
the underlying problem.

531
00:29:57,815 --> 00:29:59,148
I thought an arboretum

532
00:29:59,185 --> 00:30:02,091
would give her a chance
to continue her studies.

533
00:30:02,127 --> 00:30:04,622
Help her find something
to do with her time.

534
00:30:04,666 --> 00:30:05,692
Like a hobby?

535
00:30:05,803 --> 00:30:06,702
Exactly.

536
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,437
Exactly why it won't work.

537
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:12,943
You can't ask her to turn
her profession into a hobby.

538
00:30:12,988 --> 00:30:16,589
Would you be satisfied just
pottering around in a workshop

539
00:30:16,631 --> 00:30:18,693
building nano-circuit boards
and playing with tricorders?

540
00:30:18,736 --> 00:30:20,900
I suppose not.

541
00:30:20,942 --> 00:30:22,742
You're Chief of Operations

542
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,184
I'm a doctor,
and Keiko's a botanist

543
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,749
and until she can be
a botanist again

544
00:30:27,827 --> 00:30:31,268
I'm not sure she's ever
really going to be happy.

545
00:30:35,313 --> 00:30:37,751
Very clever.

546
00:30:37,786 --> 00:30:40,624
Very clever, indeed.

547
00:30:41,662 --> 00:30:45,034
D'Ghor has manipulated
your family's holdings

548
00:30:45,071 --> 00:30:47,669
devalued the lands you hold

549
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:49,546
and he is
the principal creditor

550
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:52,317
on Kozak's outstanding
gambling debts.

551
00:30:52,357 --> 00:30:55,456
It's no accident
your family's getting weaker

552
00:30:55,498 --> 00:30:57,834
and D'Ghor's family
is getting stronger.

553
00:30:57,905 --> 00:31:00,571
He's been systematically
attacking your family's assets

554
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:02,605
for over five years now.

555
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:05,282
You mean D'Ghor
has been scheming

556
00:31:05,324 --> 00:31:07,488
and plotting like a F...

557
00:31:07,529 --> 00:31:09,797
Like a Ferengi.

558
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:13,777
There is no honor
in what he has done.

559
00:31:13,812 --> 00:31:16,046
If he wanted
to challenge my House

560
00:31:16,085 --> 00:31:17,554
he should have made
a declaration

561
00:31:17,589 --> 00:31:19,184
met our forces in battle.

562
00:31:19,227 --> 00:31:23,033
And risk destroying
the very thing he wanted most...

563
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,665
your lands and property?

564
00:31:28,216 --> 00:31:31,520
Can you prove any of this?

565
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:34,863
You can show the Council
exactly what D'Ghor has done?

566
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,869
It's all right there.

567
00:31:35,903 --> 00:31:37,840
All I have to do
is talk them through it.

568
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:43,148
Thank you, Quark.

569
00:31:43,188 --> 00:31:45,250
You may have saved my family.

570
00:31:45,295 --> 00:31:49,636
Well, it is the House
of Quark, after all.

571
00:31:56,791 --> 00:32:02,568
I really am very grateful
for all you've done, Quark.

572
00:32:02,605 --> 00:32:08,576
That is why I'm going to let
you take your hand off my thigh

573
00:32:08,621 --> 00:32:12,829
instead of shattering
every bone in your body.

574
00:32:17,741 --> 00:32:20,647
Let's go talk to the Council.

575
00:32:22,754 --> 00:32:25,887
So, as you can see
from the gross adjusted

576
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:28,995
assets tabulation in Column "J"

577
00:32:29,037 --> 00:32:32,945
the net value
of the land acquisition

578
00:32:32,981 --> 00:32:34,450
was actually zero.

579
00:32:34,484 --> 00:32:36,044
Now, if you go to the file

580
00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:37,388
marked "devaluation
of capital income"

581
00:32:37,426 --> 00:32:38,486
we can review the way D'Ghor...

582
00:32:38,562 --> 00:32:40,226
Enough.

583
00:32:41,971 --> 00:32:45,036
I don't want to hear
anything more

584
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:49,216
about finances, mergers
or currency transactions.

585
00:32:53,935 --> 00:32:57,000
The charge has been made
that you have used money

586
00:32:57,043 --> 00:32:59,139
to bring down a great House.

587
00:32:59,182 --> 00:33:00,708
What do you say to this, D'Ghor?

588
00:33:00,753 --> 00:33:03,385
I say that he is a liar.

589
00:33:03,426 --> 00:33:08,269
That he has smeared my name
and I demand vengeance

590
00:33:08,305 --> 00:33:10,401
through personal combat.

591
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:15,223
I have discovered new evidence

592
00:33:15,257 --> 00:33:20,259
evidence which proves
Kozak did not die honorably.

593
00:33:20,303 --> 00:33:23,972
That he actually died
in an accident.

594
00:33:24,013 --> 00:33:26,953
I have a witness who will say

595
00:33:26,987 --> 00:33:31,694
he watched Kozak trip
and fall on his own blade

596
00:33:31,733 --> 00:33:35,231
and that Quark made up
the entire story.

597
00:33:35,275 --> 00:33:37,679
I don't know what
he's trying to pull here.

598
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:40,746
The only other person
who was there was...

599
00:33:45,168 --> 00:33:46,968
Hello, brother.

600
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,529
Come on, this way.

601
00:33:56,564 --> 00:33:58,056
And keep quiet!

602
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:05,520
I thought
you might try to leave.

603
00:34:05,555 --> 00:34:08,586
Look, I have done my part
in this little game of yours

604
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:11,193
and I am sorry
about your House and title

605
00:34:11,236 --> 00:34:14,905
but there's a man out there
that wants to kill me tomorrow.

606
00:34:14,946 --> 00:34:17,076
It's a matter of honor, Quark.

607
00:34:17,117 --> 00:34:19,385
D'Ghor has accused you of lying.

608
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:22,124
There's no way
to answer that challenge

609
00:34:22,164 --> 00:34:24,398
except through personal combat.

610
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,499
To you Klingons
there may be no other way

611
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:28,172
but there's
an old Ferengi saying

612
00:34:28,213 --> 00:34:30,651
about discretion being
the better part of valor.

613
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,389
Then what they say
about the Ferengi is true.

614
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:37,163
You're all lying,
thieving cowards

615
00:34:37,203 --> 00:34:40,302
who have no sense
of loyalty or honor.

616
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:42,076
Sticks and stones.

617
00:34:42,116 --> 00:34:45,147
I thought you were different.

618
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:49,361
I thought you had
something in here.

619
00:34:49,402 --> 00:34:53,971
But all you have in there
is a piece of latinum.

620
00:34:54,013 --> 00:34:57,682
And it's a pretty small piece
at that.

621
00:34:59,528 --> 00:35:01,830
Let them run.

622
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:04,567
I don't want them in my House.

623
00:35:15,268 --> 00:35:18,367
All right, let's go.

624
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,381
What?

625
00:35:20,415 --> 00:35:23,149
What?!

626
00:35:23,189 --> 00:35:26,595
You think I should stay
and fight D'Ghor?

627
00:35:26,631 --> 00:35:28,830
Is that what you're thinking?

628
00:35:28,871 --> 00:35:30,933
How could you let her
get to you like this?

629
00:35:30,976 --> 00:35:32,343
Don't you see
what she's trying to do?

630
00:35:32,379 --> 00:35:33,746
She's trying to make us
feel guilty.

631
00:35:33,817 --> 00:35:34,945
Well, it's not going to work.

632
00:35:34,987 --> 00:35:35,956
You're right, brother.

633
00:35:35,989 --> 00:35:37,049
You're a businessman.

634
00:35:37,092 --> 00:35:38,618
All you care about is profit.

635
00:35:38,662 --> 00:35:39,756
Right.

636
00:35:39,799 --> 00:35:42,101
This was all just a ploy
to boost sales at the bar.

637
00:35:42,138 --> 00:35:45,374
Who cares if some Klingon
female loses her House?

638
00:35:45,413 --> 00:35:46,439
I certainly don't.

639
00:35:46,483 --> 00:35:47,474
Me neither.

640
00:35:48,488 --> 00:35:49,787
Well...

641
00:35:49,858 --> 00:35:53,094
Now, let's get out of here.

642
00:36:06,133 --> 00:36:07,625
Grilka

643
00:36:07,671 --> 00:36:10,577
where is the leader
of your House?

644
00:36:10,612 --> 00:36:13,084
I do not know.

645
00:36:13,118 --> 00:36:15,647
Then I say
that the House of Quark

646
00:36:15,692 --> 00:36:18,791
has dishonored itself
before this Council

647
00:36:18,834 --> 00:36:23,643
and I ask that it be dissolved,
and its land and property

648
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:25,981
be turned over to me
as compensation for...

649
00:36:32,903 --> 00:36:37,210
I am Quark, son of Keldar

650
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:42,627
and I have come to answer
the challenge of D'Ghor

651
00:36:42,662 --> 00:36:45,727
son of... whatever.

652
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,298
Whatever happens,
I am proud of you.

653
00:36:59,338 --> 00:37:02,471
I wish I could say
that's comforting.

654
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:09,058
Ready?

655
00:37:10,601 --> 00:37:12,572
Ready?

656
00:37:14,377 --> 00:37:15,403
<i>DaH!</i>

657
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,910
Go ahead, kill me.

658
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:30,817
That is why I'm here,
isn't it...

659
00:37:30,854 --> 00:37:32,118
to be killed?

660
00:37:32,157 --> 00:37:33,855
Well, here I am.

661
00:37:33,894 --> 00:37:36,024
So go ahead and do it.

662
00:37:36,067 --> 00:37:37,833
You all want me
to pick up that sword

663
00:37:37,872 --> 00:37:39,136
and fight him, don't you?

664
00:37:39,175 --> 00:37:41,613
But I don't have a chance
and you know it.

665
00:37:41,648 --> 00:37:44,120
You only want me
to put up a fight

666
00:37:44,155 --> 00:37:47,619
so that your precious honor
will be satisfied.

667
00:37:47,663 --> 00:37:51,435
Well, I'm not going to make it
so easy for you.

668
00:37:53,947 --> 00:37:58,790
Having me fight D'Ghor

669
00:37:58,826 --> 00:38:01,230
is nothing more
than an execution.

670
00:38:01,266 --> 00:38:08,946
So, if that's what you want
that's what you'll get...

671
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:11,220
an execution.

672
00:38:11,258 --> 00:38:12,522
No honor

673
00:38:12,562 --> 00:38:15,330
no glory.

674
00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:18,707
And when you tell your children
and your grandchildren

675
00:38:18,744 --> 00:38:21,410
the glorious story
of how you rose to power

676
00:38:21,451 --> 00:38:23,923
and took Grilka's House
from her

677
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:27,126
I hope you remember to tell them

678
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:31,736
how you heroically killed
an unarmed Ferengi...

679
00:38:31,778 --> 00:38:33,772
half your size.

680
00:38:35,455 --> 00:38:39,022
Whatever you say, Ferengi.

681
00:38:39,064 --> 00:38:42,129
D'Ghor!
What are you doing?

682
00:38:42,172 --> 00:38:44,040
I didn't want
to believe the things

683
00:38:44,111 --> 00:38:48,053
he said about you yesterday,
but if you can stand here

684
00:38:48,087 --> 00:38:51,220
and murder
this pathetic little man

685
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:53,530
then you have no honor...

686
00:38:56,877 --> 00:39:00,580
and you have no place
in this hall.

687
00:39:34,788 --> 00:39:37,056
A brave Ferengi.

688
00:39:37,093 --> 00:39:41,160
Who would have
thought it possible?

689
00:39:49,592 --> 00:39:54,036
I believe there are enough
unusual circumstances here

690
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:57,807
to justify granting you
special dispensation.

691
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,911
You can lead your House
on your own

692
00:40:00,955 --> 00:40:04,624
if that is what you want.

693
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:09,338
<i>Yej rhin!</i>

694
00:40:21,976 --> 00:40:27,423
You have given me back my House
and my family name.

695
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,292
How can I repay you?

696
00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:32,029
I would like a divorce, please.

697
00:40:32,069 --> 00:40:33,835
No offense.

698
00:40:33,874 --> 00:40:36,905
None taken.

699
00:40:36,982 --> 00:40:40,617
I can give it to you right away.

700
00:40:41,862 --> 00:40:43,924
<i>N'Gos tlhogh cha!</i>

701
00:40:47,643 --> 00:40:49,877
You're a free man.

702
00:40:49,916 --> 00:40:52,150
A little warning
would've been nice.

703
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:03,180
<i>Qapla',</i> Quark...

704
00:41:03,217 --> 00:41:05,485
son of Keldar.

705
00:41:05,523 --> 00:41:08,861
<i>Qapla'to</i> you, too.

706
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:33,927
I've never understood
what people see in that game.

707
00:41:33,963 --> 00:41:36,663
Don't they ever get sick of it?

708
00:41:40,246 --> 00:41:42,012
Keiko...

709
00:41:42,118 --> 00:41:44,386
there's an agrobiology
expedition

710
00:41:44,424 --> 00:41:47,022
leaving
for the Janitza mountains

711
00:41:47,097 --> 00:41:48,863
on Bajor in two weeks.

712
00:41:48,902 --> 00:41:50,896
They need a chief botanist.

713
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,242
I think you could
probably qualify.

714
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,408
On Bajor?

715
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:55,851
That's right.

716
00:41:55,887 --> 00:41:58,051
They've never surveyed
these mountains.

717
00:41:58,126 --> 00:42:00,063
It's a very important
expedition.

718
00:42:00,131 --> 00:42:03,367
How long is this expedition
supposed to last?

719
00:42:03,406 --> 00:42:05,776
Six months.

720
00:42:05,813 --> 00:42:10,154
I can't leave you
and Molly for six months.

721
00:42:10,191 --> 00:42:11,991
You can take Molly with you.

722
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,396
I've already checked.

723
00:42:13,432 --> 00:42:14,731
And as for me...

724
00:42:14,769 --> 00:42:17,401
well, Bajor's only three
hours away in a runabout.

725
00:42:17,442 --> 00:42:18,877
We can manage.

726
00:42:21,353 --> 00:42:24,259
When we moved here,
we made an agreement...

727
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:25,353
I know.

728
00:42:25,396 --> 00:42:28,963
And I'm not trying
to back out of that agreement.

729
00:42:29,006 --> 00:42:31,844
Don't let this business
about the school

730
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,510
make you feel guilty, and...

731
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,317
This isn't about guilt.

732
00:42:35,356 --> 00:42:37,259
This is about you being happy

733
00:42:37,294 --> 00:42:39,390
and me knowing that you're not.

734
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:46,242
I made a promise
to stay with you

735
00:42:46,284 --> 00:42:47,776
and make this work.

736
00:42:47,822 --> 00:42:49,348
I know.

737
00:42:49,392 --> 00:42:51,363
But you're a botanist.

738
00:42:51,398 --> 00:42:53,768
That's what you're
trained to do.

739
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:55,741
That's what you love.

740
00:42:55,776 --> 00:42:58,146
Be a botanist, Keiko.

741
00:42:58,182 --> 00:43:02,249
Be the best damn botanist
in the galaxy.

742
00:43:14,156 --> 00:43:16,924
Brother?

743
00:43:16,964 --> 00:43:19,732
I haven't had
the chance to tell you

744
00:43:19,771 --> 00:43:21,435
but in the Great Hall

745
00:43:21,476 --> 00:43:24,142
when you stood there
in front of D'Ghor

746
00:43:24,249 --> 00:43:25,809
you were magnificent.

747
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:27,380
I was lucky.

748
00:43:27,424 --> 00:43:28,723
If it didn't work

749
00:43:28,761 --> 00:43:30,823
I didn't have
another card to play.

750
00:43:30,867 --> 00:43:32,701
Business is dropping off again.

751
00:43:32,738 --> 00:43:34,368
Money isn't everything.

752
00:43:34,409 --> 00:43:35,844
If father were alive

753
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,182
he'd wash your mouth
out with galcor.

754
00:43:38,286 --> 00:43:40,189
You can't buy respect, brother

755
00:43:40,224 --> 00:43:42,753
and that's what you
have now... respect.

756
00:43:42,798 --> 00:43:44,928
After all, that's what you
wanted, isn't it?

757
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:49,641
Respect is good,
but latinum's better.

758
00:43:49,682 --> 00:43:53,123
Tell the story again

759
00:43:53,157 --> 00:43:55,891
about how you stood there
in front of D'Ghor

760
00:43:55,932 --> 00:43:57,926
not knowing whether you
were going to live

761
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:59,064
to see another day.

762
00:43:59,107 --> 00:44:01,169
Everyone's tired
of hearing it, Rom.

763
00:44:01,212 --> 00:44:03,342
It's not going to boost
business anymore.

764
00:44:03,385 --> 00:44:06,518
No, I mean... tell me.

765
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:09,225
I want to hear it again.

766
00:44:10,804 --> 00:44:13,504
All right, but I'm
taking this time

767
00:44:13,544 --> 00:44:15,242
out of your paycheck.

768
00:44:16,752 --> 00:44:20,660
Well, when I entered
the Great Hall

769
00:44:20,695 --> 00:44:25,606
the first thing I noticed
was that D'Ghor

770
00:44:25,642 --> 00:44:29,915
was about a meter taller
than I remembered...
