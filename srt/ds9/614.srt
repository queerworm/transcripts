1
00:00:03,366 --> 00:00:06,933
Captain's Log, Stardate 51474.2.

2
00:00:06,975 --> 00:00:08,171
The <i>Defiant</i> has been ordered

3
00:00:08,278 --> 00:00:10,512
to investigate a rare subspace
compression phenomenon

4
00:00:10,551 --> 00:00:13,353
recently discovered
in Federation space.

5
00:00:13,392 --> 00:00:16,058
This scientific assignment
is a welcome change

6
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:19,437
from months of combat duty
against the Dominion.

7
00:00:19,474 --> 00:00:21,536
Three of my officers
are taking a runabout

8
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:23,345
into the anomaly's vortex.

9
00:00:23,384 --> 00:00:24,683
The runabout and its crew

10
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:27,125
will be subjected
to sever spatial distortion,

11
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:29,656
so we have activated a tractor
beam to minimize the effect.

12
00:00:33,711 --> 00:00:35,545
So, uh... how small are they?

13
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,645
The miniaturization
process won't begin

14
00:00:37,688 --> 00:00:40,422
until the runabout reaches the
edge of the accretion disk.

15
00:00:40,463 --> 00:00:42,525
I see. And, uh...

16
00:00:42,568 --> 00:00:44,266
then they'll begin to shrink?

17
00:00:44,306 --> 00:00:46,174
Yes, sir.

18
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,146
Major, are you laughing

19
00:00:49,185 --> 00:00:51,281
at our investigation
of this subspace anomaly?

20
00:00:51,324 --> 00:00:52,816
No, sir.

21
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:55,459
The data collected here could
provide Starfleet with the key

22
00:00:55,502 --> 00:00:58,134
to creating transwarp corridors
through space.

23
00:00:58,175 --> 00:00:59,235
It could give us

24
00:00:59,278 --> 00:01:01,807
a substantial tactical advantage
over the Dominion.

25
00:01:01,851 --> 00:01:03,617
Oh, it's very
important research.

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,519
What?!

27
00:01:06,563 --> 00:01:08,397
I'm not laughing.

28
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:11,100
I... just because

29
00:01:11,142 --> 00:01:13,808
we are shrinking three people
to the size of coffee cups...

30
00:01:14,919 --> 00:01:16,617
Smaller, actually.

31
00:01:16,656 --> 00:01:19,926
I do not see what is so humorous
about being small.

32
00:01:19,965 --> 00:01:21,366
Neither do I.

33
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,266
On screen.

34
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,304
Their visual signal's
degrading, Captain.

35
00:01:26,415 --> 00:01:27,475
We have audio only.

36
00:01:27,518 --> 00:01:29,010
Go ahead, <i>Rubicon.</i>

37
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:31,219
We're about to enter
the accretion disk.

38
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:33,027
I wish I were with you, old man.

39
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:34,501
I'll send you a postcard.

40
00:01:34,536 --> 00:01:36,872
Tell Worf I look forward
to hearing his poem.

41
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:38,504
I bet it'll be inspiring...

42
00:01:38,546 --> 00:01:41,110
We'll talk again once we've left
the accretion disk and reversed

43
00:01:41,153 --> 00:01:42,520
the effects of the compression.

44
00:01:42,557 --> 00:01:43,526
<i>Rubicon</i> out.

45
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:44,926
Good luck, <i>Rubicon.</i>

46
00:01:44,963 --> 00:01:47,093
We've lost their signal,
Captain.

47
00:01:47,135 --> 00:01:48,730
Thank you, Ensign.

48
00:01:48,773 --> 00:01:50,368
Mr. Worf.

49
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:53,048
Poem?

50
00:01:54,488 --> 00:01:55,923
It is an ancient
Klingon tradition

51
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,484
to commemorate
an important event

52
00:01:57,529 --> 00:01:59,397
with a poem.

53
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:02,065
Jadzia asked me to compose one
for this occasion.

54
00:02:02,107 --> 00:02:04,101
Well, what have you got so far?

55
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:07,279
They've penetrated
the accretion disk.

56
00:02:08,658 --> 00:02:10,150
Now, is it my imagination

57
00:02:10,195 --> 00:02:12,291
or did the kid
just cover for him?

58
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:15,432
This could be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

59
00:02:16,478 --> 00:02:17,947
They are getting smaller.

60
00:02:19,251 --> 00:02:20,379
Even the space

61
00:02:20,488 --> 00:02:22,722
within their subatomic structure
is shrinking.

62
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:24,891
I wonder what it feels like.

63
00:02:27,941 --> 00:02:29,240
I don't feel any smaller.

64
00:02:29,277 --> 00:02:30,576
Well, believe it or not

65
00:02:30,615 --> 00:02:32,917
you're about a meter tall
and shrinking fast.

66
00:02:32,954 --> 00:02:34,253
In a few minutes

67
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,922
you're going to be half the size
of a combadge.

68
00:02:36,965 --> 00:02:38,457
There's a comforting thought.

69
00:02:39,638 --> 00:02:41,768
The gamma ray flux
is increasing.

70
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,781
We should close
the blast shutters.

71
00:02:43,816 --> 00:02:45,251
Take a last look.

72
00:02:45,286 --> 00:02:47,280
We're on sensors from here on.

73
00:02:48,996 --> 00:02:51,628
You're sure we'll return
to our normal size

74
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:53,367
once we clear the anomaly?

75
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:54,706
The probes did.

76
00:02:54,744 --> 00:02:56,111
You saw the data.

77
00:02:56,147 --> 00:02:57,480
Something wrong?

78
00:02:57,518 --> 00:02:58,987
No, I'm fine.

79
00:02:59,022 --> 00:03:02,053
I'm... just not in love
with the idea of being small.

80
00:03:04,503 --> 00:03:05,802
What are you smirking at?

81
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,811
You're as small as I am.

82
00:03:07,845 --> 00:03:09,440
Actually, you're sitting

83
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:11,920
1.14 meters closer
to the focal point

84
00:03:11,956 --> 00:03:14,451
of the anomaly,
which means you've shrunk

85
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:18,335
.04 percent more than I have.

86
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:20,939
What was that?

87
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:22,973
The tractor beam is fluctuating.

88
00:03:23,017 --> 00:03:24,509
Something's wrong.

89
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,840
The Jem'Hadar are coming around
for another pass!

90
00:03:31,873 --> 00:03:32,933
Radiation from the vortex

91
00:03:32,976 --> 00:03:34,640
must have masked
their warp signature.

92
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:35,650
Return fire, Mr. Worf.

93
00:03:35,684 --> 00:03:38,156
Ensign,
pull the <i>Rubicon</i> out of there.

94
00:03:40,062 --> 00:03:41,258
Phasers are off-line.

95
00:03:44,072 --> 00:03:45,200
We're a sitting duck

96
00:03:45,242 --> 00:03:47,544
as long as we're tethered
to the runabout.

97
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:49,984
I'm not going to leave them
in there if I can help it.

98
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,014
Mr. Worf, go down
to Auxiliary Control

99
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,690
and target the phasers manually.

100
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:54,699
Aye, sir.

101
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:56,100
I'm losing the <i>Rubicon,</i> sir.

102
00:04:04,324 --> 00:04:06,056
If we're going
to get out of here

103
00:04:06,096 --> 00:04:07,326
I need warp power now!

104
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:10,061
I'm on it.

105
00:04:13,815 --> 00:04:14,612
Report.

106
00:04:18,261 --> 00:04:21,099
Shield generators and impulse
engines are off-line, sir.

107
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,604
Warp engines, too.

108
00:04:29,657 --> 00:04:30,853
Surrender

109
00:04:30,894 --> 00:04:32,158
or you will all be killed.

110
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,508
Chief, you okay?

111
00:06:38,543 --> 00:06:40,012
I think so.

112
00:06:40,047 --> 00:06:41,016
Julian?

113
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,852
I'm fine, but you're not.

114
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,450
Oh, that's better.

115
00:06:45,495 --> 00:06:47,625
That was the easy part.

116
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,364
Well, the good news
is we're alive, so we

117
00:06:49,404 --> 00:06:50,532
must have escaped the anomaly.

118
00:06:50,574 --> 00:06:52,545
The bad news
is the external sensors

119
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,174
and the com system are down.

120
00:06:54,217 --> 00:06:57,385
I can patch around most of
the damage, but it'll take time.

121
00:06:57,425 --> 00:06:59,157
Better add the blast
shutters to your list.

122
00:06:59,197 --> 00:07:01,168
I can't get them open.

123
00:07:01,202 --> 00:07:02,637
There you go.
Good as new.

124
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,005
Oh, you don't suppose
that thing'll work

125
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:04,941
on our
communications system?

126
00:07:06,115 --> 00:07:08,314
I'm picking up the <i>Defiant's</i>
transponder signal.

127
00:07:08,353 --> 00:07:09,686
We can home in on that.

128
00:07:09,723 --> 00:07:11,922
Going to one-quarter impulse.

129
00:07:11,963 --> 00:07:13,364
Chief, either
open these shutters

130
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,929
or give me external sensors...
whichever's quicker.

131
00:07:15,973 --> 00:07:17,340
I need to see
where we're going.

132
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:24,353
The Bridge is secure.

133
00:07:24,395 --> 00:07:26,059
Tactical report.

134
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:29,039
The Bridge officers
are confined in the mess hall...

135
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,068
other survivors
in the cargo bay.

136
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,242
We will have impulse power
back on line in 30 minutes

137
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:36,316
but it will take several hours
to restore warp capability.

138
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,730
It must be gratifying
for an Elder

139
00:07:38,766 --> 00:07:41,102
to end his career
with a victory.

140
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:43,703
I feel privileged
to be here with you

141
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:44,976
at such a moment.

142
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:49,221
There is still much to do
before we declare victory.

143
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,992
Until we leave
Federation space

144
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:52,125
we are vulnerable to...

145
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:54,035
I am First

146
00:07:54,072 --> 00:07:56,636
and I have declared victory.

147
00:07:56,679 --> 00:08:00,451
That is, of course,
your prerogative.

148
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,292
Open a channel to the Vorta.

149
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,390
Yes, First.

150
00:08:08,644 --> 00:08:10,946
We have the boarding party.

151
00:08:10,983 --> 00:08:12,954
Ah, First. Your report?

152
00:08:12,989 --> 00:08:15,461
The <i>Defiant</i> is ours.

153
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,261
Good. Very, very good.

154
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:19,395
I must admit, I was
initially quite skeptical

155
00:08:19,438 --> 00:08:21,136
about you
and the other new Jem'Hadar

156
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:25,985
bred in this Quadrant, but this
is a most impressive debut.

157
00:08:26,022 --> 00:08:28,494
Wouldn't you agree, Elder?

158
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:33,505
The takeover of the ship
was competently executed.

159
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,845
Do I detect a note of jealousy
in your voice?

160
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:38,548
I'm sure it must be difficult

161
00:08:38,587 --> 00:08:40,751
for you to watch
a new race of Jem'Hadar

162
00:08:40,794 --> 00:08:42,924
beginning to supplant you
and the other members

163
00:08:42,965 --> 00:08:44,434
of the old guard.

164
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,373
I serve the Founders.

165
00:08:46,408 --> 00:08:49,006
If it is their will
to create a new race

166
00:08:49,048 --> 00:08:52,147
then that is
the order of things.

167
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,454
But?

168
00:08:53,493 --> 00:08:56,626
But the Jem'Hadar bred
here in the Alpha Quadrant

169
00:08:56,668 --> 00:08:58,332
have not proven
themselves superior

170
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,206
to those in the Gamma Quadrant...

171
00:09:00,244 --> 00:09:02,181
at least not yet.

172
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:03,775
Not yet?

173
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,660
It is the Alphas
who made this victory possible.

174
00:09:07,697 --> 00:09:09,759
If it were not for us,
you would never...

175
00:09:09,802 --> 00:09:12,502
You two can argue about this
on your own time.

176
00:09:12,543 --> 00:09:15,209
First, how long
until you restore warp power?

177
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,187
I will make a complete
survey of the ship

178
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:19,420
and give you a report
in one hour.

179
00:09:19,461 --> 00:09:21,227
Very well.

180
00:09:21,332 --> 00:09:23,964
I await your report.

181
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,113
Bring me Captain Sisko.

182
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:34,258
I would suggest
that his execution can wait

183
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:38,172
until we have completed repairs
to the ship.

184
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,044
I'm not going to execute him.

185
00:09:41,618 --> 00:09:44,820
Are you about to question
my order, Second?

186
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:46,385
No.

187
00:09:46,431 --> 00:09:48,402
Obedience brings victory.

188
00:09:48,436 --> 00:09:51,238
And victory is life.

189
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:59,330
Find the ship's transponder

190
00:09:59,364 --> 00:10:00,833
and shut it down.

191
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:02,498
I don't want anyone tracking us.

192
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:03,508
Yes, First.

193
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,444
And get these chairs
off the Bridge.

194
00:10:10,393 --> 00:10:12,489
Thanks.
That's enough.

195
00:10:12,531 --> 00:10:14,297
I should have foreseen this.

196
00:10:14,336 --> 00:10:16,034
I should have sent out
reconnaissance probes

197
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,566
to scan for enemy ships

198
00:10:17,612 --> 00:10:18,638
or a shuttle

199
00:10:18,681 --> 00:10:19,980
or recalibrated the sensors.

200
00:10:20,017 --> 00:10:20,986
If I had, Jadzia...

201
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,014
None of that would
have done any good.

202
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:24,085
The Jem'Hadar approached us

203
00:10:24,128 --> 00:10:25,654
from the anterior angle
of the anomaly.

204
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,862
Their warp...

205
00:10:26,902 --> 00:10:28,770
signature...

206
00:10:28,807 --> 00:10:30,402
He's just trying
to tell you that...

207
00:10:30,511 --> 00:10:32,414
I do not need him
to tell me anything.

208
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:33,917
Everybody settle.

209
00:10:33,954 --> 00:10:37,122
First of all, we don't know
what happened to the <i>Rubicon.</i>

210
00:10:37,162 --> 00:10:39,794
For all we know, they got
out of the anomaly on their own.

211
00:10:39,836 --> 00:10:41,328
If they did, they're headed home

212
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,311
and in much better
shape than we are.

213
00:10:43,345 --> 00:10:47,378
So let's hold off on analyzing
our mistakes for now.

214
00:10:47,422 --> 00:10:49,724
If they restore warp power,
we'll be analyzing them

215
00:10:49,762 --> 00:10:51,756
from inside
a Dominion prison camp.

216
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,272
Restoring warp power...

217
00:10:54,306 --> 00:10:56,801
might not be so simple for them.

218
00:10:56,846 --> 00:10:58,646
It took us a week

219
00:10:58,684 --> 00:11:01,122
just to learn how to pilot
one of their ships.

220
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:06,097
We might have a chance
to retake the <i>Defiant</i>

221
00:11:06,137 --> 00:11:07,401
but we can't do anything

222
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:09,344
unless we can get
out of this room.

223
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:10,609
Suggestions?

224
00:11:14,827 --> 00:11:16,730
Captain Sisko...

225
00:11:16,765 --> 00:11:17,995
come with me.

226
00:11:20,843 --> 00:11:22,643
Everybody sit tight.

227
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,173
I'll be back.

228
00:11:34,344 --> 00:11:36,942
We've lost the <i>Defiant's</i>
transponder signal.

229
00:11:36,984 --> 00:11:38,510
Coming to a full stop.

230
00:11:38,555 --> 00:11:39,956
The problem isn't at this end.

231
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:41,359
They must have
stopped transmitting.

232
00:11:41,395 --> 00:11:42,523
I can't keep
flying blind, Chief.

233
00:11:42,632 --> 00:11:43,794
Try the shutters.

234
00:11:46,576 --> 00:11:47,943
Nice work.

235
00:11:47,979 --> 00:11:50,075
Ask and ye shall receive.

236
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,720
What the hell is that?

237
00:11:53,761 --> 00:11:55,230
Some kind of wall?

238
00:11:55,265 --> 00:11:57,259
In the middle of nowhere?

239
00:11:57,304 --> 00:11:59,503
Wait a minute.
There's a symbol up there.

240
00:12:00,545 --> 00:12:04,043
It looks like
a large black circle.

241
00:12:04,088 --> 00:12:05,387
Anything else?

242
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:06,724
Hold on.

243
00:12:09,869 --> 00:12:11,533
Chief...

244
00:12:11,641 --> 00:12:13,042
you're not going to like this.

245
00:12:51,414 --> 00:12:53,351
I thought you said we'd return
to our normal size

246
00:12:53,385 --> 00:12:54,376
once we left the anomaly.

247
00:12:54,422 --> 00:12:55,482
We should have.

248
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:56,858
We didn't leave the anomaly

249
00:12:56,895 --> 00:12:58,866
by the same path by
which we entered it.

250
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,392
So the process failed
to reverse itself.

251
00:13:00,438 --> 00:13:01,998
Are you telling me
I'm going to be

252
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,978
this bloody tall
for the rest of my life?

253
00:13:04,013 --> 00:13:06,679
This bloody tall, actually.

254
00:13:06,721 --> 00:13:08,122
But don't worry...

255
00:13:08,157 --> 00:13:10,287
all we have to do
to regain our original size

256
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,390
is reenter the anomaly

257
00:13:11,432 --> 00:13:13,666
and follow our original
trajectory back out.

258
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:14,696
In theory.

259
00:13:16,178 --> 00:13:17,442
In theory.

260
00:13:17,482 --> 00:13:19,146
Well, I'll tell you
what isn't a theory.

261
00:13:19,186 --> 00:13:20,816
We're going to need
the <i>Defiant's</i> help

262
00:13:20,857 --> 00:13:23,295
to reenter the anomaly.

263
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,768
With communications out,
how do we get their attention?

264
00:13:25,803 --> 00:13:28,298
Fly up to a window and knock?

265
00:13:28,343 --> 00:13:29,607
Wait.

266
00:13:29,646 --> 00:13:33,087
If we're... this big?

267
00:13:33,122 --> 00:13:36,324
That means the <i>Rubicon</i>
is what, this big?

268
00:13:36,364 --> 00:13:37,560
More or less.

269
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,041
And the <i>Defiant's</i> aft
plasma vent is...

270
00:13:41,077 --> 00:13:42,512
this big?

271
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:45,247
Are you suggesting
that we take the <i>Rubicon</i>

272
00:13:45,354 --> 00:13:47,758
inside the <i>Defiant?</i>

273
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:49,092
Well, why not?

274
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,968
Getting past the anti-back flow
valve might be tricky

275
00:13:52,004 --> 00:13:53,030
but once we're inside

276
00:13:53,074 --> 00:13:54,806
we've a better chance
of attracting

277
00:13:54,846 --> 00:13:56,783
someone's attention than
we do sitting out here.

278
00:13:56,817 --> 00:13:59,449
I love it. Let's go.

279
00:14:02,432 --> 00:14:04,802
The engineering team reports
that we can start

280
00:14:04,838 --> 00:14:06,570
the impulse engines
in 12 minutes.

281
00:14:06,609 --> 00:14:08,010
Good.

282
00:14:10,085 --> 00:14:12,614
Captain Benjamin Sisko...

283
00:14:12,658 --> 00:14:15,496
the one the Bajorans
call "the Emissary."

284
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:17,025
I am First Kudak'Etan.

285
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:19,837
In a strange way,
you are the reason I exist.

286
00:14:19,877 --> 00:14:21,814
If you had not
eliminated our fleet

287
00:14:21,849 --> 00:14:24,447
in the wormhole,
there would have been no need

288
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,426
to breed Alpha Quadrant
Jem'Hadar.

289
00:14:26,461 --> 00:14:28,729
You didn't bring me
here to say "thank you."

290
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,171
No. The impulse
engine sustained

291
00:14:31,207 --> 00:14:33,543
only minor damage
in our attack

292
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:35,847
but the warp drive
was severely damaged.

293
00:14:35,885 --> 00:14:37,947
I will need
your technical expertise

294
00:14:37,991 --> 00:14:39,255
in order to repair it.

295
00:14:39,294 --> 00:14:41,458
Bring Captain Sisko
to the Engine Room

296
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,471
so he may begin
necessary repairs.

297
00:14:43,505 --> 00:14:45,339
It's a mistake.

298
00:14:45,376 --> 00:14:47,347
Giving him access
to the Engine Room

299
00:14:47,415 --> 00:14:49,283
will only give him
an opportunity

300
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,416
to retake the ship.

301
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:56,195
In fact, he's working on a plan
at this very moment.

302
00:14:56,238 --> 00:14:57,468
I was not aware

303
00:14:57,508 --> 00:14:59,810
that telepathy was
a Gamma characteristic.

304
00:14:59,847 --> 00:15:02,251
I know what he's thinking
because it's exactly

305
00:15:02,287 --> 00:15:04,281
what I would be doing
in his position.

306
00:15:04,326 --> 00:15:06,730
You should kill him now
before he has a chance

307
00:15:06,766 --> 00:15:08,201
to put his plan into motion.

308
00:15:08,236 --> 00:15:09,671
You are the Second.

309
00:15:09,706 --> 00:15:10,834
I am the First.

310
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:14,545
Do not presume to tell me
what to do.

311
00:15:16,122 --> 00:15:18,617
I'm glad the two of you
worked that out.

312
00:15:18,663 --> 00:15:21,728
Now, what makes you think
I'm going to help you?

313
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,938
Your choice is to repair
the warp drive

314
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,390
or watch me execute
your crew one at a time.

315
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,267
Have Sixth Duran'Adar

316
00:15:34,303 --> 00:15:35,795
select one of the prisoners
for execution

317
00:15:35,841 --> 00:15:37,812
and bring him to the Bridge.

318
00:15:37,846 --> 00:15:39,281
I can't do this job alone.

319
00:15:39,317 --> 00:15:41,254
I'm going to need
some of my crew.

320
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:42,952
How many?

321
00:15:42,992 --> 00:15:45,328
I strongly suggest
you refuse this request.

322
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:47,336
You have the weapons.

323
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:52,441
Are you afraid you can't handle
a few unarmed prisoners?

324
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,957
I won't be baited
by a prisoner...

325
00:15:55,993 --> 00:15:57,964
and neither should you.

326
00:16:01,173 --> 00:16:02,403
Okay, I'm in no hurry

327
00:16:02,443 --> 00:16:04,311
to reach a Dominion
prison camp.

328
00:16:04,347 --> 00:16:06,409
If you want me to teach your men

329
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,392
how to repair a warp drive,
that's fine with me.

330
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:12,926
We'll begin with primary command
and control systems.

331
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,873
That should take
about six hours...

332
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:17,642
then we will move up
to basic engineering theory

333
00:16:17,683 --> 00:16:19,551
for a class-7 warp drive.
Then...

334
00:16:19,588 --> 00:16:20,579
Enough!

335
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:24,961
You may have the other three
Bridge officers

336
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:26,402
but that is all.

337
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:29,675
And I'm not interested in any
more of your "suggestions."

338
00:16:31,485 --> 00:16:33,217
Now take him to the Engine Room.

339
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:56,541
Where are we, Chief?

340
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,210
We've just about reached

341
00:16:58,255 --> 00:17:00,385
the bipolar flow junction,
I think.

342
00:17:00,427 --> 00:17:01,657
You think?

343
00:17:01,697 --> 00:17:03,759
Well, I'm not used to seeing
things from this perspective.

344
00:17:04,972 --> 00:17:08,344
Once we reach the flow junction,
we should be able to go up

345
00:17:08,381 --> 00:17:10,352
into the secondary warp
plasma feed

346
00:17:10,386 --> 00:17:13,154
and then exit
by the diagnostic panel.

347
00:17:13,193 --> 00:17:14,959
This conduit's filthy, Chief.

348
00:17:14,998 --> 00:17:16,297
Don't you ever clean up
in here?

349
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:17,303
All right, all right.

350
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:18,306
Let's not badger the Chief.

351
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,309
Thank you.

352
00:17:19,342 --> 00:17:21,404
I'm sorry.
It was very small of me.

353
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:39,393
Whatever it is you're planning

354
00:17:39,428 --> 00:17:40,397
don't.

355
00:17:40,431 --> 00:17:42,334
I'll be watching you

356
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:44,499
and at the first sign
of treachery

357
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:46,878
I will kill
all your Bridge officers.

358
00:17:46,914 --> 00:17:47,883
I'm a prisoner.

359
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:48,886
I have no intention...

360
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,119
The First may be a fool,
but I am not.

361
00:17:51,158 --> 00:17:53,061
Then it is a pity for you

362
00:17:53,097 --> 00:17:54,965
that you are not the First.

363
00:17:55,002 --> 00:17:56,632
I was...

364
00:17:56,673 --> 00:17:59,909
until two days ago.

365
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:02,477
If we had captured you
while I was in command

366
00:18:02,521 --> 00:18:04,789
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

367
00:18:04,827 --> 00:18:06,821
Deck Two, Section Five.

368
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:09,772
What happened?

369
00:18:09,807 --> 00:18:11,607
He is an Alpha.

370
00:18:11,678 --> 00:18:13,512
I am a Gamma.

371
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,886
His DNA
and psychological profile

372
00:18:15,923 --> 00:18:19,490
are specifically designed
for combat in this Quadrant.

373
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:22,506
The Founders believe
that makes him a better leader.

374
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,636
What do you believe?

375
00:18:28,054 --> 00:18:31,153
I believe I've given you
enough information already.

376
00:18:41,656 --> 00:18:44,220
We have restored impulse power
and the warp drive

377
00:18:44,263 --> 00:18:46,166
will be operational
in five hours.

378
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:48,969
Excellent. It's good to see
my faith in you

379
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:50,376
has not been misplaced.

380
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:52,076
The Founders will be pleased.

381
00:18:52,116 --> 00:18:54,087
If you require
no more assistance

382
00:18:54,122 --> 00:18:56,390
I will resume
our mission to Coridan.

383
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,899
Let's hope the Federation's
dilithium miners

384
00:18:58,934 --> 00:19:02,170
will be as surprised to see us
as the <i>Defiant's</i> crew was.

385
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,614
Victory is life.

386
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,450
Indeed.

387
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,236
Set course for the nearest
Dominion outpost.

388
00:19:15,276 --> 00:19:17,338
Engage impulse engines.

389
00:19:23,397 --> 00:19:24,366
Uh-oh.

390
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,369
What is it?

391
00:19:25,403 --> 00:19:27,067
The magnetic plasma
guides are heating up.

392
00:19:27,107 --> 00:19:30,047
They must have initiated
the impulse prestart sequence.

393
00:19:30,082 --> 00:19:31,381
What does that mean then?

394
00:19:31,418 --> 00:19:32,910
It means this entire conduit

395
00:19:32,956 --> 00:19:35,258
is about to be filled
with superheated plasma.

396
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,925
When you say "superheated"...

397
00:19:36,966 --> 00:19:39,200
If I can't find
another way out of here

398
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:40,367
we'll be vaporized.

399
00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:41,378
Is that clear?

400
00:19:41,411 --> 00:19:42,402
Crystal.

401
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,180
There's a distribution
manifold coming up.

402
00:19:54,223 --> 00:19:55,522
Take the left conduit.

403
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,655
Then make a quick right
into the relays.

404
00:19:57,764 --> 00:20:00,670
Left... then right.

405
00:20:00,772 --> 00:20:02,675
I hope you know
where you're going, Chief.

406
00:20:02,777 --> 00:20:04,269
So do I.

407
00:20:05,385 --> 00:20:06,615
Through the relays.

408
00:20:06,655 --> 00:20:08,489
There's an inspection
hatch coming up

409
00:20:08,527 --> 00:20:10,521
on the right.

410
00:20:10,565 --> 00:20:12,536
If we can figure out a way
to open the ha...

411
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,104
We're out of time.

412
00:20:22,194 --> 00:20:23,424
What about the hatch?

413
00:20:23,464 --> 00:20:25,766
We'll have to open it
the old-fashioned way.

414
00:20:33,223 --> 00:20:34,749
Let's not do that again.

415
00:20:34,795 --> 00:20:36,493
No promises.

416
00:20:36,532 --> 00:20:38,298
So where are we, Chief?

417
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:41,038
We should be
in the Engine Room

418
00:20:41,078 --> 00:20:43,049
near the warp core.

419
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,313
Right.

420
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,813
There's the core.

421
00:20:56,885 --> 00:21:00,223
Looks like the warp
drive is off-line.

422
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,490
Quite a mess.

423
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,931
I wonder what happened.

424
00:21:02,968 --> 00:21:05,497
I will verify
the settings myself.

425
00:21:11,456 --> 00:21:13,120
What are you doing?

426
00:21:14,464 --> 00:21:17,164
Realigning the dilithium
articulation frame.

427
00:21:17,204 --> 00:21:20,076
Instruct him on how to
complete the realignment.

428
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,914
It'll take longer
to explain than just to...

429
00:21:22,952 --> 00:21:25,720
Then explain it quickly.

430
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,195
Give him the tool.

431
00:21:33,346 --> 00:21:34,645
All right.

432
00:21:34,683 --> 00:21:38,523
Start by decoupling
the lateral microbrace.

433
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,882
That's not good.

434
00:22:07,569 --> 00:22:09,038
Chief, I need visual sensors

435
00:22:09,072 --> 00:22:10,541
as fast as you can
get them to me.

436
00:22:10,577 --> 00:22:11,546
Right.

437
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:13,447
Julian, give me a hand
down here.

438
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:32,458
Okay, you should have
visual sensors now.

439
00:22:33,469 --> 00:22:35,839
The com system's
back on line.

440
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:38,643
They're forcing our crew
to repair the warp drive.

441
00:22:38,682 --> 00:22:40,950
Why's the Captain
going along with this?

442
00:22:40,988 --> 00:22:42,184
Good question.

443
00:22:42,225 --> 00:22:44,925
But if I know Benjamin,
he's up to something.

444
00:22:44,965 --> 00:22:47,871
Can you give me a tight shot
on the operations display?

445
00:22:47,906 --> 00:22:48,966
I think so.

446
00:22:53,688 --> 00:22:55,157
Do you see what I see?

447
00:22:55,192 --> 00:22:56,388
Hmm. Very clever.

448
00:22:56,429 --> 00:22:58,161
Oh, the problem is
it's never going to work.

449
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,833
The Bridge control lockouts.

450
00:23:00,873 --> 00:23:03,037
The security codes are hardwired

451
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:05,107
through
the encryption circuitry.

452
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:07,783
Will someone please let me
in on this conversation?

453
00:23:07,825 --> 00:23:09,124
The Captain's trying
to take control

454
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:10,289
of the ship from Engineering.

455
00:23:10,331 --> 00:23:11,595
Kira is

456
00:23:11,634 --> 00:23:14,266
the only one actually
working on the warp drive

457
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:15,277
but it doesn't look

458
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,145
like she's in any hurry
to get it done.

459
00:23:17,182 --> 00:23:19,677
I think Worf's trying
to cover their tracks.

460
00:23:19,722 --> 00:23:21,784
It looks like he's sending
false signals

461
00:23:21,827 --> 00:23:23,319
to the computer system.

462
00:23:23,365 --> 00:23:25,165
Nog is the key.

463
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,937
He's trying to override
the Bridge control lockout

464
00:23:27,977 --> 00:23:30,005
so he can release
the command codes.

465
00:23:30,116 --> 00:23:31,483
If he can do that

466
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,650
the Captain can control
the entire ship

467
00:23:33,691 --> 00:23:35,217
from the operations console.

468
00:23:35,263 --> 00:23:37,895
Nog's a smart kid,
but it's going to take him weeks

469
00:23:37,936 --> 00:23:39,600
to release the codes from here.

470
00:23:39,641 --> 00:23:41,042
Can we do anything to help him?

471
00:23:41,078 --> 00:23:43,140
Not from Engineering.

472
00:23:44,487 --> 00:23:46,047
If we could get to the Bridge

473
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:47,856
we could release the codes
from there.

474
00:23:47,895 --> 00:23:48,864
How?

475
00:23:48,898 --> 00:23:50,060
Wait a minute.
One thing at a time.

476
00:23:50,168 --> 00:23:51,763
First, we need to get
out of the Engine Room

477
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,796
without getting caught.

478
00:24:04,772 --> 00:24:06,036
Why is the Klingon working

479
00:24:06,143 --> 00:24:07,875
on the plasma
displace subsystem?

480
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:09,247
Because I told him to.

481
00:24:09,284 --> 00:24:12,258
That system has nothing to do
with warp drive operation.

482
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:16,200
Maybe not on Dominion ships,
but I'll need to use the display

483
00:24:16,235 --> 00:24:18,365
to monitor
warp plasma stability.

484
00:24:18,408 --> 00:24:19,399
Pardon me.

485
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,891
Seventh, power up
the magneto-impellers

486
00:24:24,925 --> 00:24:26,224
and advance the field coils.

487
00:24:26,261 --> 00:24:28,927
Call out every five teslas
until I tell you to stop.

488
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:30,667
Yes, Major.

489
00:24:36,655 --> 00:24:37,624
Easy does it.

490
00:24:37,657 --> 00:24:39,491
We don't want
to burn out the inducers.

491
00:24:40,532 --> 00:24:42,024
Now what?

492
00:24:43,205 --> 00:24:45,507
Now we wait until someone
walks out that door.

493
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:49,322
Sixth!

494
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:50,324
Yes, Second.

495
00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:52,728
Relieve the Klingon.

496
00:24:52,764 --> 00:24:55,566
Take over the repair
of the display subsystem.

497
00:24:55,604 --> 00:24:57,039
Immediately, Second!

498
00:24:58,044 --> 00:25:00,174
Give the Klingon another task.

499
00:25:00,217 --> 00:25:01,516
Why?

500
00:25:01,553 --> 00:25:03,251
Because I said so.

501
00:25:05,263 --> 00:25:07,827
Why is the warp drive
not on line yet?

502
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,305
He's stalling.

503
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,468
"Stalling"?

504
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:13,780
Your Second is the one
who's slowing down the work.

505
00:25:13,818 --> 00:25:15,982
He countermands my orders

506
00:25:16,024 --> 00:25:17,425
arbitrarily reassigns my crew.

507
00:25:17,461 --> 00:25:20,127
I can't get any work
done in here!

508
00:25:20,168 --> 00:25:23,006
You were told to watch them,
not to interfere with them.

509
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:25,708
You're playing
right into his hands.

510
00:25:25,749 --> 00:25:27,481
Don't you see that?

511
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,826
Captain Sisko...

512
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,326
you have 30 minutes
to restore warp power

513
00:25:34,372 --> 00:25:37,574
or I will kill... her

514
00:25:37,613 --> 00:25:39,311
and another of your crew

515
00:25:39,351 --> 00:25:41,880
every 15 minutes
until you do.

516
00:25:41,924 --> 00:25:45,228
And you, Second, will no longer
interfere with their work.

517
00:25:49,377 --> 00:25:50,846
Get ready.

518
00:25:50,881 --> 00:25:52,749
When he activates
the door sensor, we'll...

519
00:26:09,931 --> 00:26:11,400
Nice bit of piloting.

520
00:26:11,434 --> 00:26:12,403
If you liked that

521
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:14,567
you're going to love
what's coming up next.

522
00:26:35,235 --> 00:26:36,204
Any luck, Ensign?

523
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:37,203
Not yet, sir.

524
00:26:37,307 --> 00:26:39,369
The system is always
three steps ahead of me.

525
00:26:39,413 --> 00:26:41,213
Every time I get past
the primary security net

526
00:26:41,251 --> 00:26:43,154
the secondary
always kicks me back out

527
00:26:43,189 --> 00:26:44,989
and the codes are all reset

528
00:26:45,027 --> 00:26:47,899
and I have to start
all over again.

529
00:26:48,937 --> 00:26:51,171
Ah... Like that.

530
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,614
Do you have a backup plan
in case this doesn't work?

531
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,780
Yes.
I'll destroy the ship.

532
00:26:59,631 --> 00:27:02,503
There are still a few algorithms
I haven't tried yet.

533
00:27:07,284 --> 00:27:08,378
Thanks.

534
00:27:08,421 --> 00:27:11,087
All right, I'm ready to connect
the deuterium injector.

535
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,191
Go to the plasma relay
and power it up...

536
00:27:13,234 --> 00:27:14,966
but slowly,
just like I showed you.

537
00:27:20,118 --> 00:27:22,386
I'm about ten minutes away
from initiating

538
00:27:22,424 --> 00:27:24,588
the prestart sequence
in the warp drive.

539
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,599
How's Nog doing?

540
00:27:25,633 --> 00:27:28,105
Not good. You'll have
to find another problem.

541
00:27:29,141 --> 00:27:30,405
Too fast!

542
00:27:30,444 --> 00:27:32,278
Reinitialize the system
and start again

543
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,378
but do it at about half
the speed this time.

544
00:27:35,424 --> 00:27:37,395
Well, he's not stupid.

545
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:40,700
He's already got the entire
command and control system

546
00:27:40,738 --> 00:27:41,764
committed to memory.

547
00:27:41,808 --> 00:27:43,438
I can't keep him fooled forever.

548
00:27:43,478 --> 00:27:46,144
In a battle of wits
between you and him

549
00:27:46,186 --> 00:27:48,020
I'll bet on you every time.

550
00:27:48,058 --> 00:27:50,496
Hmm. What kind of odds
are you giving?

551
00:28:12,888 --> 00:28:14,859
First?

552
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,921
I've realigned
the targeting sensors.

553
00:28:16,966 --> 00:28:19,564
There were errors
in the tracking subroutines.

554
00:28:19,606 --> 00:28:22,272
You were not ordered
to check the targeting sensors.

555
00:28:22,313 --> 00:28:24,341
Well, I thought it
a wise precaution

556
00:28:24,385 --> 00:28:27,382
in case we encountered
an enemy ship on our way home.

557
00:28:28,395 --> 00:28:30,366
Your initiative pleases me.

558
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,303
It's a trait
that the Gammas lack.

559
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:34,367
Well, the Gammas
have many flaws.

560
00:28:34,445 --> 00:28:36,507
When we return from this mission

561
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,920
there will be need
for a new Second.

562
00:28:38,956 --> 00:28:41,190
I will recommend you
to the Vorta.

563
00:28:41,229 --> 00:28:43,029
You will not be disappointed.

564
00:28:43,067 --> 00:28:44,400
I'm sure that I won't.

565
00:28:44,504 --> 00:28:45,996
It'll be Alphas like us

566
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:48,809
that determine the
future of this Quadrant.

567
00:28:48,849 --> 00:28:51,344
That will be the
new order of things.

568
00:29:01,046 --> 00:29:03,142
Looks like we need another
ticket into the Bridge.

569
00:29:03,186 --> 00:29:06,126
So how long do we wait
for someone to open the door?

570
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,824
We don't.

571
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,350
I cannot access
the auto-destruct system

572
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:17,947
without drawing attention.

573
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,323
Plant a computer virus

574
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,297
in the warp plasma
subprocessor.

575
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:25,002
Set it to cause a core breach
once the ship reaches warp 1.

576
00:29:27,482 --> 00:29:28,678
Understood.

577
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,839
Don't hit it too hard.

578
00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:40,577
It could shatter
the control panel.

579
00:29:40,616 --> 00:29:41,585
Don't worry.

580
00:29:41,619 --> 00:29:42,713
I have a light touch.

581
00:29:42,755 --> 00:29:44,281
Not according to Worf.

582
00:29:45,295 --> 00:29:46,925
What?

583
00:30:07,787 --> 00:30:09,781
Well, we certainly can't release
the control lock

584
00:30:09,825 --> 00:30:11,260
while the First
has his hand on it.

585
00:30:11,295 --> 00:30:12,696
Can we bypass it?

586
00:30:13,802 --> 00:30:16,001
Well, I suppose I could reroute

587
00:30:16,041 --> 00:30:18,775
the encryption
subprocessors manually.

588
00:30:18,815 --> 00:30:20,011
But?

589
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:22,022
But I'd have to leave
the ship to do it.

590
00:30:22,057 --> 00:30:24,187
And I have to say, I'm
not fond of the idea.

591
00:30:24,229 --> 00:30:25,596
I can think of a thousand ways

592
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:27,603
a one-centimeter man
could get fried

593
00:30:27,705 --> 00:30:30,075
walking around
inside a circuit housing.

594
00:30:30,112 --> 00:30:31,240
Relax, Miles.

595
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,510
You wouldn't be able
to go out there

596
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,610
even if you wanted to.

597
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,916
You wouldn't be able to breathe.

598
00:30:34,957 --> 00:30:36,928
The oxygen molecules outside

599
00:30:36,962 --> 00:30:39,092
are almost 2,000 times
larger than anything

600
00:30:39,135 --> 00:30:40,434
your hemoglobin
could assimilate.

601
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:41,440
You'd suffocate.

602
00:30:41,474 --> 00:30:43,069
Well.

603
00:30:43,111 --> 00:30:44,478
That takes care of that idea.

604
00:30:44,516 --> 00:30:46,419
Unless...

605
00:30:46,454 --> 00:30:48,482
Circuit housings are airtight.

606
00:30:48,526 --> 00:30:51,294
I could beam a bubble
of compressed air

607
00:30:51,332 --> 00:30:54,500
ahead of you, and it would
expand to fill the housing.

608
00:30:56,547 --> 00:30:57,516
Well, it should work.

609
00:30:57,549 --> 00:30:59,349
I mean, the air
would be thin, but, uh...

610
00:30:59,387 --> 00:31:00,913
you'd be able to breathe
for about 20 minutes.

611
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:01,857
And then?

612
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:03,591
You'd pass out.

613
00:31:07,943 --> 00:31:08,934
We'd pass out.

614
00:31:08,979 --> 00:31:10,505
You're coming with me.

615
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:28,722
This might take longer
than I thought.

616
00:31:33,743 --> 00:31:34,803
All right.

617
00:31:34,846 --> 00:31:37,546
If we beamed in
to the primary safeties junction

618
00:31:37,586 --> 00:31:42,189
we should see a cluster
of heuristic subprocessors...

619
00:31:42,232 --> 00:31:45,730
next to a rectilinear
expansion module.

620
00:31:45,841 --> 00:31:47,971
The question is:

621
00:31:48,013 --> 00:31:51,044
What does a rectilinear
expansion module look like

622
00:31:51,088 --> 00:31:52,752
when you're one centimeter tall?

623
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,352
What?

624
00:31:54,396 --> 00:31:56,766
I haven't the faintest idea...

625
00:31:56,836 --> 00:31:58,773
but it's amazing.

626
00:31:58,808 --> 00:32:01,976
It's like we're in the middle
of an optronic forest.

627
00:32:02,016 --> 00:32:03,714
Looks like we need to go...

628
00:32:03,787 --> 00:32:06,225
Julian, stop!

629
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:10,928
That chip behind you
is carrying 20 microamps

630
00:32:10,973 --> 00:32:12,306
of electric current.

631
00:32:12,343 --> 00:32:13,744
Now that's not very much...

632
00:32:13,847 --> 00:32:17,721
But it's enough to fry
every synapse in my tiny body.

633
00:32:17,757 --> 00:32:19,557
Thanks for the tip.

634
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,668
All right, stay right behind me.

635
00:32:27,081 --> 00:32:29,451
And don't touch anything
without asking.

636
00:32:29,487 --> 00:32:31,355
Believe me, I won't.

637
00:32:47,434 --> 00:32:48,869
The white.

638
00:32:53,282 --> 00:32:55,344
It is time.

639
00:33:01,972 --> 00:33:03,738
How's it coming, Chief?

640
00:33:03,777 --> 00:33:05,543
We're making progress.

641
00:33:05,581 --> 00:33:06,982
Aren't we, Chief?

642
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,648
I'm still trying to locate

643
00:33:08,689 --> 00:33:10,819
the security protocol
interlink.

644
00:33:10,895 --> 00:33:13,506
It shouldn't take much longer.

645
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,041
Well, the sooner the better.

646
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:16,877
Things are getting
a little crowded up here.

647
00:33:33,091 --> 00:33:35,393
We pledge our loyalties
to the Founders...

648
00:33:36,499 --> 00:33:38,561
We're all Alphas here.

649
00:33:38,605 --> 00:33:42,604
Our loyalty is demonstrated
by our actions, not our words.

650
00:33:47,495 --> 00:33:49,831
All right.

651
00:33:49,868 --> 00:33:51,098
Now...

652
00:33:51,138 --> 00:33:52,107
Miles...

653
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,205
we're lost, aren't we?

654
00:33:55,248 --> 00:33:56,912
Yes, we're lost.

655
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:02,727
I can draw these circuits
in my sleep.

656
00:34:02,767 --> 00:34:06,732
I've just... never seen them
from this perspective.

657
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,247
Disorientation...

658
00:34:08,282 --> 00:34:10,880
it's one of the effects
of hypoxia...

659
00:34:10,922 --> 00:34:12,414
lack of oxygen.

660
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,628
Need to focus on a landmark.

661
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:17,605
There.

662
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,633
That large isolinear chip...

663
00:34:19,678 --> 00:34:23,518
number 58966 stroke delta.

664
00:34:23,554 --> 00:34:24,989
What is it?

665
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:28,523
Julian, there are
two dozen 66/deltas

666
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:31,666
in the asymmetric
encryption circuits alone.

667
00:34:33,046 --> 00:34:37,855
All right, then what...
what's this here at its base?

668
00:34:37,892 --> 00:34:40,626
Well, that's a four-way
interlink shunt.

669
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:43,230
So... that would mean
that this chip is?

670
00:34:44,509 --> 00:34:45,739
I don't know!

671
00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:48,149
I told you that they
all look the same to me.

672
00:34:48,185 --> 00:34:49,745
All right, don't look at it.

673
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:50,758
What?!

674
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:52,193
Close your eyes.

675
00:34:52,229 --> 00:34:53,824
Use your memory.

676
00:34:55,404 --> 00:34:59,780
Okay. There's a four-way
shunt at the base

677
00:34:59,815 --> 00:35:03,918
of a 58966 stroke delta
isolinear chip...

678
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,361
which is where?

679
00:35:07,001 --> 00:35:11,377
The only four-way
shunt near a 66/delta

680
00:35:11,412 --> 00:35:13,816
is at the base...

681
00:35:13,852 --> 00:35:16,985
of the master
differential relay.

682
00:35:17,027 --> 00:35:19,021
That's got to be it.

683
00:35:19,065 --> 00:35:23,406
So the interlink we want
has to be?

684
00:35:23,443 --> 00:35:24,707
That way.

685
00:35:34,271 --> 00:35:35,706
We've got trouble.

686
00:35:35,742 --> 00:35:39,114
They're cross-checking
the diagnostic protocols.

687
00:35:39,184 --> 00:35:41,314
Has Nog made any progress?

688
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,430
Not yet.

689
00:36:00,941 --> 00:36:02,069
It's stuck.

690
00:36:25,204 --> 00:36:26,696
Which one?

691
00:36:26,741 --> 00:36:29,145
That one.

692
00:36:30,651 --> 00:36:32,086
No, no, no.

693
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:35,051
That one.

694
00:36:35,096 --> 00:36:36,531
You sure?

695
00:36:54,847 --> 00:36:56,442
Oh...

696
00:36:56,485 --> 00:36:58,719
Again.

697
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:11,014
Julian.

698
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,954
<i>Rub-Rubicon...</i>

699
00:37:25,694 --> 00:37:28,793
m-mission complete.

700
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,855
Oh, I am good.

701
00:37:37,892 --> 00:37:40,660
Come with me.

702
00:37:40,699 --> 00:37:43,696
All of you,
step away from the consoles!

703
00:37:43,741 --> 00:37:45,541
Right now!

704
00:37:47,217 --> 00:37:49,655
Captain, I did it.

705
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:52,687
I don't know how, but I
released the command codes.

706
00:37:52,731 --> 00:37:53,893
Well done.

707
00:37:53,933 --> 00:37:57,203
What we need now is a diversion
before they go to warp.

708
00:37:57,243 --> 00:37:58,108
Silence!

709
00:38:03,859 --> 00:38:05,796
All the <i>Defiant's</i>
command functions

710
00:38:05,831 --> 00:38:07,597
have been transferred
to Engineering...

711
00:38:07,636 --> 00:38:08,935
but nothing's happening.

712
00:38:08,973 --> 00:38:10,272
Well, maybe the Captain
doesn't realize

713
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,404
he has control of the ship yet.

714
00:38:11,446 --> 00:38:13,576
Or maybe he's in trouble.

715
00:38:13,618 --> 00:38:15,087
The First was called
to the Engine Room

716
00:38:15,122 --> 00:38:16,523
a few minutes ago.

717
00:38:24,046 --> 00:38:27,179
How long has the warp drive
been repaired?

718
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:31,163
At least one hour...
maybe longer.

719
00:38:31,197 --> 00:38:33,795
And they managed
to conceal it from you?

720
00:38:33,837 --> 00:38:36,970
You ordered me not
to interfere with them.

721
00:38:37,012 --> 00:38:39,712
I also told you
to watch them carefully.

722
00:38:39,753 --> 00:38:43,023
If we had assigned Jem'Hadar
to do the repair, as I said...

723
00:38:43,061 --> 00:38:45,967
I am not interested
in your excuses.

724
00:38:46,003 --> 00:38:47,735
Bring the warp drive on line.

725
00:38:52,084 --> 00:38:53,417
Wait.

726
00:38:54,759 --> 00:38:56,993
Before we activate
the warp drive

727
00:38:57,031 --> 00:38:59,265
we should check
the entire system

728
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:00,864
for possible sabotage.

729
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:04,915
That would take hours...
every minute we spend

730
00:39:04,952 --> 00:39:07,151
in Federation space
exposes us to detection

731
00:39:07,191 --> 00:39:08,353
and attack

732
00:39:08,393 --> 00:39:10,387
and I would hate
for your last mission

733
00:39:10,466 --> 00:39:13,030
to end in failure, Elder.

734
00:39:13,073 --> 00:39:14,337
Do it.

735
00:39:20,826 --> 00:39:22,421
And when you have

736
00:39:22,497 --> 00:39:24,400
sufficient engine power
available

737
00:39:24,435 --> 00:39:25,961
bring us to warp 4.

738
00:39:26,007 --> 00:39:28,879
At least we're going
to take them with us.

739
00:39:28,913 --> 00:39:31,681
Secure these four
with the other prisoners.

740
00:39:49,543 --> 00:39:50,671
Dax, upper rail.

741
00:39:50,713 --> 00:39:51,510
I've got him.

742
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,839
This guy is really starting
to get on my nerves.

743
00:40:15,878 --> 00:40:16,743
I have torpedo lock.

744
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:17,510
Fire!

745
00:40:39,105 --> 00:40:40,803
I'm flooding
all the compartments

746
00:40:40,843 --> 00:40:43,179
except the Engine Room
with anesthezine gas.

747
00:40:43,216 --> 00:40:45,187
Major, get that virus
out of the computer

748
00:40:45,221 --> 00:40:47,420
before someone on the Bridge
engages the warp drive.

749
00:40:47,494 --> 00:40:48,485
Aye, sir.

750
00:40:50,636 --> 00:40:52,368
He should have listened
to you and killed me

751
00:40:52,407 --> 00:40:53,933
when he had the chance.

752
00:40:55,081 --> 00:40:56,949
He was a First.

753
00:40:56,985 --> 00:41:00,859
They don't need... to...

754
00:41:00,895 --> 00:41:02,330
listen.

755
00:41:02,365 --> 00:41:05,031
Obedience brings

756
00:41:05,073 --> 00:41:09,710
victory, and victory is...

757
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,488
Mr. Worf, I think
your wife is here.

758
00:41:37,824 --> 00:41:40,262
Captain's Log, supplemental.

759
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:41,824
After completing repairs

760
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:43,499
we were able to return
to the anomaly

761
00:41:43,573 --> 00:41:46,171
and successfully restore
our runabout and its crew

762
00:41:46,214 --> 00:41:47,740
to their normal size.

763
00:41:47,784 --> 00:41:48,997
The surviving Jem'Hadar

764
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:52,697
have been transferred
to a Federation P.O.W. Camp.

765
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,073
Is that your poem?

766
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:56,306
Yes.

767
00:41:57,351 --> 00:41:58,615
Bloodwine.

768
00:41:58,655 --> 00:42:00,421
Can I hear it?

769
00:42:01,663 --> 00:42:02,962
It is not finished yet.

770
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:05,801
Oh, please?
Just the first line?

771
00:42:06,809 --> 00:42:08,176
All right.

772
00:42:08,247 --> 00:42:09,807
But it is my first poem.

773
00:42:09,851 --> 00:42:10,945
I understand.

774
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:14,155
And I have worked very long
and very hard on this.

775
00:42:14,195 --> 00:42:15,323
I know.

776
00:42:15,365 --> 00:42:16,664
I do not wish to be ridiculed.

777
00:42:16,702 --> 00:42:18,400
I promise.

778
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,742
Very well.

779
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:23,678
"This is the story

780
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,092
of the little ship
that took a little trip."

781
00:42:28,266 --> 00:42:29,964
What do you think?

782
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:36,447
It's, uh...

783
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:37,979
Well, it rhymes.

784
00:42:42,168 --> 00:42:44,834
There's nothing on this padd.

785
00:42:49,554 --> 00:42:51,856
We were just minding
our own business

786
00:42:51,893 --> 00:42:54,092
when suddenly,
right there in front of us

787
00:42:54,132 --> 00:42:56,194
was this immense Jem'Hadar.

788
00:42:56,237 --> 00:42:58,801
He looked as tall
as a Seltan carnosaur.

789
00:42:58,845 --> 00:43:00,314
We were so close

790
00:43:00,415 --> 00:43:03,217
you could see the veins
in his eyeballs throbbing.

791
00:43:03,256 --> 00:43:04,384
We swung around

792
00:43:04,425 --> 00:43:06,589
and ducked behind
the operations console.

793
00:43:06,631 --> 00:43:09,001
I knew we had to get
our sensors back on line

794
00:43:09,038 --> 00:43:10,268
if we were going
to be of any help

795
00:43:10,375 --> 00:43:11,844
to the Captain and the others.

796
00:43:11,878 --> 00:43:13,508
So I said to Julian...

797
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,018
Is there something wrong?

798
00:43:16,156 --> 00:43:20,327
Are you sure you've returned
to your normal size?

799
00:43:21,537 --> 00:43:22,597
Of course.

800
00:43:24,712 --> 00:43:26,147
Why?

801
00:43:27,152 --> 00:43:28,986
Well, you both appear to be

802
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,322
a couple
of centimeters shorter

803
00:43:30,427 --> 00:43:32,421
than you were
the last time I saw you.

804
00:43:33,435 --> 00:43:35,669
A changeling notices
that sort of thing.

805
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:38,781
I didn't want to say anything

806
00:43:38,815 --> 00:43:42,279
but you do look a little...

807
00:43:42,324 --> 00:43:43,657
on the petite side.

808
00:43:47,537 --> 00:43:49,063
Infirmary.

809
00:43:54,322 --> 00:43:57,923
And they say you don't
have a sense of humor.
