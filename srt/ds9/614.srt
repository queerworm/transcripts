SISKO:
<i>Captain's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 51474.2.</i>

2
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:07,508
<i>The</i> Defiant<i> has been ordered</i>

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,426
<i>to investigate a rare</i>
<i>subspace compression</i>
<i>phenomenon</i>

4
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:12,011
<i>recently discovered</i>
<i>in Federation space.</i>

5
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:14,598
<i>This scientific assignment</i>
<i>is a welcome change</i>

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,101
<i>from months of combat duty</i>
<i>against the Dominion.</i>

7
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,228
<i>Three of my officers</i>
<i>are taking a runabout</i>

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,063
<i>into the anomaly's vortex.</i>

9
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,691
<i>The runabout and its crew</i>

10
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,734
<i>will be subjected</i>
<i>to severe spatial distortion,</i>

11
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:28,529
<i>so we have activated</i>
<i>a tractor beam</i>
<i>to minimize the effect.</i>

12
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,493
So, uh... how
small are they?

13
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,370
The miniaturization
process won't begin

14
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,164
until the runabout
reaches the edge
of the accretion disk.

15
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,333
I see. And, uh...

16
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,126
then they'll
begin to shrink?

17
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,294
Yes, sir.

18
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,045
(<i> chuckling</i> )

19
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,756
Major, are
you laughing

20
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,258
at our investigation
of this subspace anomaly?

21
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,886
No, sir.

22
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:53,971
The data collected here could
provide Starfleet with the key

23
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:56,849
to creating transwarp corridors
through space.

24
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:58,308
It could give us

25
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,143
a substantial
tactical advantage
over the Dominion.

26
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:03,939
Oh, it's very
important research.

27
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,399
What?!

28
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,359
I'm not laughing.

29
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,737
I... just because

30
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:10,946
we are shrinking
three people

31
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,364
to the size
of coffee cups--

32
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,824
(<i> laughing</i> )

33
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,116
Smaller, actually.

34
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,452
I do not see
what is so humorous

35
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,579
about being small.

36
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,788
Neither do I.

37
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,957
(<i> incoming com beep</i> )

38
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,000
On screen.

39
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:24,334
Their visual
signal's

40
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,294
degrading, Captain.
We have audio only.

41
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,922
Go ahead,<i> Rubicon.</i>

42
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,840
DAX:
<i>We're about to enter</i>
<i>the accretion disk.</i>

43
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:31,383
I wish I were
with you, old man.

44
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,092
<i>I'll send you a postcard.</i>

45
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,303
<i>Tell Worf I look forward</i>
<i>to hearing his poem.</i>

46
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,931
I bet it'll be inspiring--
(<i> static buzz</i> )

47
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,223
<i>We'll talk again</i>
<i>once we've left</i>

48
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,808
<i>the accretion disk</i>
<i>and reversed</i>

49
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,936
<i>the effects of the compression.</i>
Rubicon<i> out.</i>

50
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,812
Good luck,<i> Rubicon.</i>

51
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,731
We've lost their signal,
Captain.

52
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:48,067
Thank you, Ensign.

53
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,110
Mr. Worf.

54
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,612
Poem?

55
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:52,863
(<i> sighs</i> )

56
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,406
It is an ancient
Klingon tradition

57
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,991
to commemorate
an important event

58
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,826
with a poem.

59
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,579
Jadzia asked me to compose one
for this occasion.

60
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,916
Well, what have
you got so far?

61
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:06,085
They've penetrated
the accretion disk.

62
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,587
Now, is it
my imagination

63
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,006
or did the kid
just cover for him?

64
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,007
This could be
the beginning

65
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,009
of a beautiful
friendship.

66
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,721
They are getting smaller.

67
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,264
NOG:
Even the space

68
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,266
within their subatomic
structure is shrinking.

69
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,560
I wonder
what it feels like.

70
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,649
I don't<i> feel</i> any smaller.

71
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,067
Well, believe it or not

72
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:32,069
you're about a meter tall
and shrinking fast.

73
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:35,072
In a few minutes,
you're going to be half
the size of a combadge.

74
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:36,782
There's
a comforting thought.

75
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:40,619
The gamma ray flux
is increasing.

76
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,329
We should close
the blast shutters.

77
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,538
DAX:
Take a last look.

78
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,332
We're on sensors
from here on.

79
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,004
You're<i> sure</i> we'll return
to our normal size

80
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,797
once we clear
the anomaly?

81
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:52,756
The probes did.

82
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,675
You saw the data.

83
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,926
Something wrong?

84
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,427
No, I'm fine.

85
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,597
I'm... just not in love
with the idea of being small.

86
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,810
What are you smirking at?

87
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,603
You're as small
as I am.

88
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:07,813
Actually, you're sitting

89
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,482
1.14 meters closer
to the focal point

90
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,943
of the anomaly,
which means you've shrunk

91
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:16,738
.04 percent more than I have.

92
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,700
What was that?

93
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,118
The tractor beam
is fluctuating.

94
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,577
Something's wrong.

95
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,708
(<i> yelling</i> )

96
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,793
The Jem'Hadar are coming around
for another pass!

97
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,003
Radiation from the vortex

98
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:33,088
must have masked
their warp signature.

99
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,381
Return fire, Mr. Worf.

100
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,800
Ensign, pull the<i> Rubicon</i>
out of there.

101
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,054
Phasers are off-line.

102
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,183
We're a
sitting duck

103
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,767
as long as we're tethered
to the runabout.

104
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,936
I'm not going to leave them
in there if I can help it.

105
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,313
Mr. Worf, go down
to Auxiliary Control

106
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,648
and target the phasers
manually.

107
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,818
Aye, sir.
I'm losing the<i> Rubicon,</i> sir.

108
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,493
If we're going
to get out of here,

109
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,829
I need warp power now!

110
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,289
I'm on it.

111
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,712
SISKO:
Report.

112
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,634
Shield generators and impulse
engines are off-line, sir.

113
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,095
Warp engines, too.

114
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,604
Surrender,
or you will all be killed.

115
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,148
(<i> whoosh of transport</i> )

116
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,315
DAX: Chief, you okay?

117
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:39,941
I think so.

118
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:40,942
DAX: Julian?

119
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:44,029
I'm fine, but you're not.

120
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,530
Oh, that's better.

121
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,074
That was the easy part.

122
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,742
Well, the good news
is we're alive, so we

123
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,327
must have escaped
the anomaly.

124
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:52,411
The bad news
is the external sensors

125
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,206
and the com system are down.

126
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,875
I can patch around
most of the damage,
but it'll take time.

127
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,668
Better add the blast
shutters to your list.

128
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,670
I can't get
them open.

129
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,381
There you go.
Good as new.

130
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:03,924
Oh, you don't suppose
that thing'll work

131
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,051
on our
communications system?
(<i> chuckles</i> )

132
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,969
I'm picking up the<i> Defiant's</i>
transponder signal.

133
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,554
We can home in on that.

134
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,681
Going to
one-quarter impulse.

135
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:12,891
Chief, either
open these shutters

136
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,268
or give me
external sensors--

137
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,602
whichever's quicker.

138
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,938
I need to see
where we're going.

139
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,319
The bridge is secure.

140
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,154
Tactical report.

141
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,698
The bridge officers
are confined
in the mess hall--

142
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,867
other survivors
in the cargo bay.

143
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,702
We will have impulse power
back on line in 30 minutes,

144
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,246
but it will
take several hours

145
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,456
to restore warp capability.

146
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,292
It must be gratifying
for an Elder

147
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,835
to end his career
with a victory.

148
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,297
I feel privileged
to be here with you

149
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,048
at such a moment.

150
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,718
There is still much to do
before we declare victory.

151
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,720
Until we leave
Federation space,

152
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:51,638
we are vulnerable to--

153
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,432
<i>I</i> am First,

154
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,226
and<i> I</i> have
declared victory.

155
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:59,771
That is, of course,
your prerogative.

156
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,857
Open a channel
to the Vorta.

157
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,067
SIXTH: Yes, First.

158
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,657
We have
the boarding party.

159
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,575
<i>Ah, First. Your report?</i>

160
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,453
The<i> Defiant</i> is ours.

161
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,331
<i>Good. Very, very good.</i>

162
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,333
<i>I must admit, I was</i>
<i>initially quite skeptical</i>

163
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,293
<i>about you</i>
<i>and the other new Jem'Hadar</i>

164
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:26,047
<i>bred in this Quadrant,</i>
<i>but this is</i>
<i>a most impressive debut.</i>

165
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,133
<i>Wouldn't you agree, Elder?</i>

166
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,802
The takeover
of the ship

167
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,013
was competently
executed.

168
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:36,433
<i>Do I detect a note of jealousy</i>
<i>in your voice?</i>

169
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,018
<i>I'm sure it must be difficult</i>

170
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,187
<i>for you to watch</i>
<i>a new race of Jem'Hadar</i>

171
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,563
<i>beginning to supplant you</i>
<i>and the other members</i>

172
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,857
<i>of the old guard.</i>

173
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,859
I serve
the Founders.

174
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,488
If it is their will
to create a new race,

175
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,823
then that is
the order of things.

176
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,408
<i>But...?</i>

177
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,952
But the Jem'Hadar bred
here in the Alpha Quadrant

178
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,787
have not proven
themselves superior

179
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,498
to those
in the Gamma Quadrant--

180
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,666
at least not yet.

181
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,835
Not yet?

182
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,255
It is the Alphas
who made this victory possible.

183
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,216
If it were not for us,
you would never--

184
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,926
<i>You two can argue about this</i>
<i>on your own time.</i>

185
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,513
<i>First, how long</i>
<i>until you restore warp power?</i>

186
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,764
I will make a complete
survey of the ship

187
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,475
and give you a report
in one hour.

188
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:20,560
<i>Very well.</i>

189
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,979
<i>I await your report.</i>

190
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,442
Bring me Captain Sisko.

191
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:34,449
I would suggest
that his execution can wait

192
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,411
until we have completed repairs
to the ship.

193
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,329
I'm not going to execute him.

194
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,958
Are you about to question
my order, Second?

195
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,002
No.

196
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,088
Obedience brings victory.

197
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,549
And victory is life.

198
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,639
Find the ship's transponder

199
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,766
and shut it down.

200
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,560
I don't want
anyone tracking us.

201
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,769
Yes, First.

202
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,938
And get these chairs
off the bridge.

203
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,861
Thanks.
That's enough.

204
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,405
I should have foreseen this.

205
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,198
I should have sent out
reconnaissance probes

206
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,783
to scan for enemy ships,

207
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,243
or a shuttle,

208
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,036
or recalibrated the sensors.
If I had, Jadzia--

209
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,122
NOG:
None of that would
have done any good.

210
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,373
The Jem'Hadar
approached us

211
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,292
from the anterior angle
of the anomaly.

212
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,295
Their warp...
signature...

213
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,670
He's just trying
to tell you that--

214
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,714
I do not need him
to tell me anything.

215
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,467
Everybody settle.

216
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:34,801
First of all,
we don't know

217
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,136
what happened
to the<i> Rubicon.</i>

218
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,345
For all we know, they got

219
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,846
out of the anomaly
on their own.

220
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,515
If they did,
they're headed home,

221
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,976
and in much better
shape than we are.

222
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,185
So let's hold off

223
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,438
on analyzing our
mistakes for now.

224
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,689
If they restore warp power,
we'll be analyzing them

225
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,942
from inside
a Dominion prison camp.

226
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,154
Restoring warp power...

227
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,239
might not be so simple
for them.

228
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,657
It took us a week

229
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,577
just to learn how to
pilot one of their ships.

230
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,079
We might have a chance

231
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,206
to retake
the<i> Defiant,</i>

232
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,958
but we can't do anything

233
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,543
unless we can get
out of this room.

234
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:09,919
Suggestions?

235
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,176
Captain Sisko...

236
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,552
come with me.

237
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,182
Everybody sit tight.

238
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,391
I'll be back.

239
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,862
We've lost the<i> Defiant's</i>
transponder signal.

240
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,572
Coming to
a full stop.

241
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:38,906
The problem
isn't at this end.

242
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,575
They must have
stopped transmitting.

243
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:43,370
I can't keep
flying blind, Chief.
Try the shutters.

244
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:45,704
(<i> metallic clanking</i> )

245
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,914
Nice work.

246
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,167
O'BRIEN:
Ask and ye shall receive.

247
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,129
What the hell is that?

248
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,297
DAX: Some kind of wall?

249
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,714
In the middle of nowhere?

250
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,510
Wait a minute.
There's a symbol up there.

251
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:03,097
It looks like
a large black circle.

252
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,099
Anything else?

253
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,351
Hold on.

254
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,855
Chief...

255
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,148
you're not going to like this.

256
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,188
I thought you said we'd return
to our normal size

257
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,357
once we left the anomaly.
We should have.

258
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,692
We didn't leave
the anomaly

259
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,110
by the same path by
which we entered it.

260
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,237
So the process failed
to reverse itself.

261
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,739
Are you telling me
I'm going to be

262
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,032
this bloody tall
for the rest of my life?

263
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,702
This bloody tall,
actually.

264
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,161
But don't worry--

265
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,038
all we have to do
to regain our original size

266
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,626
is reenter the anomaly
and follow our original
trajectory back out.

267
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,877
In theory.

268
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,254
In theory.

269
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,131
Well, I'll tell you
what isn't a theory.

270
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,840
We're going to need
the<i> Defiant's</i> help

271
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,343
to reenter the anomaly.

272
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,638
With communications out,
how do we get their attention?

273
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,432
Fly up to a window
and knock?

274
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,975
Wait.

275
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:32,186
If we're... this big?

276
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,106
That means the<i> Rubicon</i>
is what, this big?

277
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,524
More or less.

278
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:40,361
And the<i> Defiant's</i> aft
plasma vent is...

279
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,155
this big?

280
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,365
DAX:
Are you suggesting
that we take the<i> Rubicon</i>

281
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,117
inside the<i> Defiant?</i>

282
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,910
Well, why not?

283
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,747
Getting past the anti-back flow
valve might be tricky

284
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:53,040
but once we're inside,
we've a better chance
of attracting

285
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,669
someone's attention than
we do sitting out here.

286
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,962
I love it. Let's go.

287
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,760
The engineering team reports
that we can start

288
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:05,512
the impulse engines
in 12 minutes.

289
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,096
Good.

290
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,434
Captain Benjamin Sisko...

291
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:14,187
the one the Bajorans
call "the Emissary."

292
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,980
I am First Kudak'Etan.

293
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,692
In a strange way,
you are the reason I exist.

294
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,401
If you had not
eliminated our fleet

295
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,737
in the wormhole,
there would have been no need

296
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,114
to breed Alpha Quadrant
Jem'Hadar.

297
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,534
You didn't bring me
here to say thank you.

298
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,994
No. The impulse
engine sustained

299
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,912
only minor damage
in our attack,

300
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,207
but the warp drive
was severely damaged.

301
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,000
I will need
your technical expertise

302
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,794
in order to repair it.

303
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,379
Bring Captain Sisko
to the Engine Room

304
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,922
so he may begin
necessary repairs.

305
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,258
It's a mistake.

306
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,302
Giving him access
to the Engine Room

307
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,804
will only give him
an opportunity

308
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,514
to retake the ship.

309
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,767
In fact, he's
working on a plan

310
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,186
at this very moment.

311
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,437
I was not aware

312
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,439
that telepathy was
a Gamma characteristic.

313
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:01,025
I know what he's thinking
because it's exactly

314
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,444
what I would be doing
in his position.

315
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,446
You should kill him now
before he has a chance

316
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,031
to put his plan
into motion.

317
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,366
<i>You</i> are the Second.

318
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,868
<i>I</i> am the First.

319
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,537
Do not presume to tell me
what to do.

320
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,499
I'm glad the two of you
worked that out.

321
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:20,420
Now, what makes you think
I'm going to help you?

322
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:23,673
Your choice is to repair
the warp drive,

323
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:27,968
or watch me execute
your crew one at a time.

324
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,640
Have Sixth Duran'Adar

325
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,517
select one of the prisoners
for execution

326
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,227
and bring him to the Bridge.

327
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,978
I can't do
this job alone.

328
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,106
I'm going to need
some of my crew.

329
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,357
How many?

330
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,903
I strongly suggest
you refuse this request.

331
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,613
You have the weapons.

332
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,406
Are you afraid
you can't handle

333
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,284
a few unarmed prisoners?

334
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,788
I won't be baited
by a prisoner...

335
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,706
and neither should you.

336
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,252
Okay, I'm in no hurry

337
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,337
to reach a Dominion
prison camp.

338
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,923
If you want me
to teach your men

339
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,134
how to repair a warp drive,
that's fine with me.

340
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,010
We'll begin with
primary command

341
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,137
and control systems.

342
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,847
That should take
about six hours--

343
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:16,267
then we will move up
to basic engineering theory

344
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,394
for a class-7
warp drive. Then--

345
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:19,520
Enough!

346
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,524
You may have the other three
Bridge officers,

347
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,192
but that is all.

348
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,446
And I'm not interested in any
more of your "suggestions."

349
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:31,699
Now take him
to the Engine Room.

350
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,515
Where are we, Chief?

351
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,641
We've just about reached

352
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,018
the bipolar flow junction,
I think.

353
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,645
You think?

354
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,564
Well, I'm not used to seeing
things from this perspective.

355
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,650
Once we reach
the flow junction,

356
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:06,776
we should be able to go up

357
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,862
into the secondary warp
plasma feed,

358
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,531
and then exit
by the diagnostic panel.

359
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,199
This conduit's filthy,
Chief.

360
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,826
Don't you ever clean up
in here?

361
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,828
All right, all right.
Let's not badger
the Chief.

362
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:17,954
Thank you.

363
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:20,331
I'm sorry.
It was very small of me.

364
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:39,266
Whatever it is
you're planning,
don't.

365
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,768
I'll be watching you,

366
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,979
and at the first sign
of treachery,

367
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:45,648
I will kill
all your bridge officers.

368
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,191
I'm a prisoner.
I have no intention--

369
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,402
The First may be a fool,
but I am not.

370
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,528
Then it is
a pity for you

371
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,322
that you are
not the First.

372
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:55,157
I was...

373
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,118
until two days ago.

374
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,162
If we had captured you
while I was in command,

375
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,623
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

376
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,418
Deck Two, Section Five.

377
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,838
What happened?

378
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,172
He is an Alpha.

379
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,966
I am a Gamma.

380
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,176
His DNA
and psychological profile

381
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:18,222
are specifically designed
for combat in this Quadrant.

382
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,975
The Founders believe
that makes him a better leader.

383
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,227
What do you believe?

384
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,776
I believe I've given you
enough information already.

385
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,280
(<i> door opens</i> )

386
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,580
We have restored impulse power
and the warp drive

387
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,373
will be operational
in five hours.

388
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,876
<i>Excellent. It's good to see</i>
<i>my faith in you</i>

389
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,711
<i>has not been misplaced.</i>

390
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,212
<i>The Founders will be pleased.</i>

391
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,506
<i>If you require</i>
<i>no more assistance,</i>

392
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,634
<i>I will resume</i>
<i>our mission to Coridan.</i>

393
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,095
<i>Let's hope the Federation's</i>
<i>dilithium miners</i>

394
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,598
<i>will be as surprised to see us</i>
<i>as the Defiant's crew was.</i>

395
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,101
Victory is life.

396
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,477
<i>Indeed.</i>

397
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,611
Set course for the nearest
Dominion outpost.

398
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,822
Engage impulse engines.

399
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,955
Uh-oh.
What is it?

400
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,748
The magnetic plasma
guides are heating up.

401
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,958
They must
have initiated

402
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,709
the impulse
prestart sequence.

403
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:29,752
What does that mean then?

404
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,170
It means this entire conduit

405
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,506
is about to be filled
with superheated plasma.

406
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,424
When you say
"superheated"...

407
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,802
If I can't find
another way out of here,

408
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,012
we'll be vaporized.

409
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,054
Is that clear?

410
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,305
Crystal.

411
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:52,066
O'BRIEN:
There's a distribution
manifold coming up.

412
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,442
Take the left conduit.

413
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:56,154
Then make a quick right
into the relays.

414
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,739
Left... then right.

415
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,783
I hope you know
where you're going, Chief.

416
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,242
So do I.

417
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,620
Through the relays.

418
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,413
There's an inspection
hatch coming up

419
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,749
on the right.

420
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,376
If we can figure out a way
to open the ha--

421
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,836
(<i> console beeping</i> )

422
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:12,837
We're out of time.

423
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,047
(<i> insistent beeping</i> )

424
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,512
What about the hatch?

425
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,806
We'll have to open it
the old-fashioned way.

426
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,773
Let's not do that again.

427
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,734
No promises.

428
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,319
So where are
we, Chief?

429
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,655
We should be
in the Engine Room

430
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,032
near the warp core.

431
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,324
Right.

432
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,837
There's the core.

433
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:57,965
Looks like the warp
drive is off-line.

434
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,593
Quite a mess.
I wonder what happened.

435
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,554
JEM'HADAR:
I will verify
the settings myself.

436
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,312
What are you doing?

437
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,691
Realigning the dilithium
articulation frame.

438
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,819
Instruct him on how to
complete the realignment.

439
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,696
It'll take longer
to explain than just to--

440
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,824
Then explain it quickly.

441
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,243
Give him the tool.

442
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:32,458
All right.

443
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:36,212
Start by decoupling
the lateral microbrace.

444
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:49,934
DAX: That's not good.

445
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:06,742
Chief, I need visual sensors

446
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,452
as fast as you can
get them to me.

447
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,289
Right. Julian, give me
a hand down here.

448
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,224
Okay, you should have
visual sensors now.

449
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,187
The com system's
back on line.

450
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,605
DAX:
They're forcing our crew
to repair the warp drive.

451
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,732
BASHIR:
Why's the Captain
going along with this?

452
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,151
DAX: Good question.

453
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:42,778
But if I know Benjamin,
he's up to something.

454
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,531
Can you give me a tight shot
on the operations display?

455
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,740
I think so.

456
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:52,788
DAX:
Do you see what I see?

457
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,248
O'BRIEN:
Hmm. Very clever.

458
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,834
Oh, the problem is
it's never going to work.

459
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,086
The Bridge
control lockouts.

460
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,005
The security codes
are hardwired

461
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,840
through
the encryption circuitry.

462
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,718
Will someone please
let me in on this
conversation?

463
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,886
The Captain's trying
to take control

464
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,595
of the ship
from Engineering.

465
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:12,016
Kira is the only one actually
working on the warp drive,

466
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:15,228
but it doesn't look
like she's in any hurry
to get it done.

467
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:17,313
DAX:
I think Worf's trying
to cover their tracks.

468
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:18,981
It looks like he's sending
false signals

469
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,650
to the computer system.

470
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,194
O'BRIEN:
Nog is the key.

471
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:25,779
He's trying to override
the Bridge control lockout

472
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,032
so he can release
the command codes.

473
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,283
If he can do that,

474
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,035
the Captain can control
the entire ship

475
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,786
from the operations
console.

476
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,789
Nog's a smart kid,
but it's going
to take him weeks

477
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,208
to release the codes
from here.

478
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,459
Can we do anything to help him?

479
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,920
Not from Engineering.

480
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,672
If we could get to the Bridge,

481
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:45,049
we could release the codes
from there.

482
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:47,968
How?
Wait a minute.
One thing at a time.

483
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,595
First, we need to get
out of the Engine Room

484
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,013
without getting caught.

485
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,441
Why is the Klingon working

486
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,527
on the plasma
display subsystem?

487
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,154
Because I told him to.

488
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,740
That system has
nothing to do
with warp drive operation.

489
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,367
Maybe not on
Dominion ships

490
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:13,244
but I'll need
to use the display

491
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:15,746
to monitor warp
plasma stability.

492
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:16,830
Pardon me.

493
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,378
KIRA:
Seventh, power up
the magneto-impellers

494
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,837
and advance the field coils.

495
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,799
Call out every five teslas
until I tell you to stop.

496
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,550
SEVENTH:
Yes, Major.

497
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:35,473
KIRA:
Easy does it.

498
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,310
We don't want
to burn out the inducers.

499
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:40,478
Now what?

500
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,856
Now we wait until someone
walks out that door.

501
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:46,986
Sixth!

502
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,321
Yes, Second.

503
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:50,239
Relieve the Klingon.

504
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:53,200
Take over the repair
of the display subsystem.

505
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,828
Immediately,
Second!

506
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,080
Give the Klingon
another task.

507
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:59,248
Why?

508
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,041
Because I said so.

509
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,712
Why is the warp drive
not on line yet?

510
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,047
He's stalling.

511
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:08,424
"Stalling"?

512
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:09,716
Your Second is the one

513
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,593
who's slowing
down the work.

514
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,304
He countermands my orders,

515
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:15,055
arbitrarily
reassigns my crew.

516
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:17,475
I can't get any work
done in here!

517
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:20,311
You were told to watch them,
not to interfere with them.

518
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:23,647
You're playing
right into his hands.

519
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:24,898
Don't you see that?

520
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,444
Captain Sisko...

521
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:31,989
you have 30 minutes
to restore warp power

522
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,867
or I will kill... her

523
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,494
and another of your crew

524
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:39,205
every 15 minutes
until you do.

525
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,708
And you, Second, will no longer
interfere with their work.

526
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,172
Get ready.

527
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,299
When he activates
the door sensor, we'll...

528
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:09,068
Nice bit of piloting.

529
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,945
If you liked that
you're going to love
what's coming up next.

530
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:33,967
SISKO: Any luck, Ensign?

531
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,261
Not yet, sir.

532
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,137
The system is always
three steps ahead of me.

533
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,306
Every time I get past
the primary security net,

534
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,392
the secondary
always kicks me back out

535
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:43,727
and the codes are all reset,

536
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,854
and I have to start
all over again.

537
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:46,939
(<i> beep</i> )

538
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,233
Ah... Like that.

539
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,277
Do you have a backup plan
in case this doesn't work?

540
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,820
Yes. I'll
destroy the ship.

541
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,784
There are still
a few algorithms

542
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,411
I haven't tried yet.

543
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,208
Thanks.

544
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,293
All right,
I'm ready to connect

545
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,835
the deuterium injector.

546
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,796
Go to the plasma relay
and power it up--

547
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,965
but slowly,
just like I showed you.

548
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,972
I'm about ten minutes away
from initiating

549
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,182
the prestart sequence
in the warp drive.

550
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:23,601
How's Nog doing?

551
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:26,061
Not good. You'll have
to find another problem.

552
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:27,187
(<i> insistent beeping</i> )

553
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:28,397
Too fast!

554
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:29,898
Reinitialize the system
and start again,

555
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,276
but do it at about half
the speed this time.

556
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,695
Well, he's not stupid.

557
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,324
He's already got the entire
command and control system

558
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,366
committed to memory.

559
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,160
I can't keep him
fooled forever.

560
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,621
In a battle of wits
between you and him,

561
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:45,914
I'll bet on you
every time.

562
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:48,334
Hmm. What kind of odds
are you giving?

563
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:14,776
First?
I've realigned
the targeting sensors.

564
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:17,363
There were errors
in the tracking subroutines.

565
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,324
You were not ordered
to check
the targeting sensors.

566
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,284
Well, I thought it
a wise precaution

567
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,953
in case we encountered
an enemy ship on our way home.

568
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,123
Your initiative pleases me.

569
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:29,875
It's a trait
that the Gammas lack.

570
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,918
Well, the Gammas
have many flaws.

571
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,547
When we return
from this mission,

572
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,714
there will be need
for a new Second.

573
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,717
I will recommend
you to the Vorta.

574
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,511
You will not
be disappointed.

575
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:43,305
I'm sure that I won't.

576
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:44,640
It'll be Alphas like us

577
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:46,266
that determine the
future of this Quadrant.

578
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:49,353
<i>That</i> will be
the new order of things.

579
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,073
O'BRIEN:
Looks like we need another
ticket into the Bridge.

580
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,659
So how long do we wait
for someone to open the door?

581
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:05,369
We don't.

582
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,752
I cannot access
the auto-destruct system

583
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,421
without drawing attention.

584
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,796
Plant a computer virus

585
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,049
in the warp plasma
subprocessor.

586
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,551
Set it to cause
a core breach

587
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:22,886
once the ship
reaches warp 1.

588
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:26,557
Understood.

589
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,483
Don't hit it too hard.

590
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,068
It could shatter
the control panel.

591
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,320
Don't worry.
I have a light touch.

592
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:41,863
Not according to Worf.

593
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:44,366
What?

594
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,930
Well, we certainly
can't release

595
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,724
the control lock
while the First
has his hand on it.

596
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:10,309
Can we bypass it?

597
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:13,353
Well, I suppose
I could reroute

598
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:16,148
the encryption
subprocessors manually.

599
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,524
But...?

600
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,652
But I'd have to leave
the ship to do it.

601
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,570
And I have to say, I'm
not fond of the idea.

602
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:23,029
I can think of
a thousand ways

603
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,073
a one-centimeter man
could get fried

604
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:27,367
walking around inside
a circuit housing.

605
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,995
Relax, Miles.
You wouldn't be able
to go out there

606
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,163
even if you wanted to.

607
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,623
You wouldn't
be able to breathe.

608
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:33,999
The oxygen molecules
outside

609
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,126
are almost 2,000 times
larger than anything

610
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,877
your hemoglobin
could assimilate.

611
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:38,878
You'd suffocate.

612
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,380
Well.

613
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:41,923
That takes care of that idea.

614
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,842
Unless--

615
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,803
Circuit housings are airtight.

616
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,597
I could beam a bubble
of compressed air

617
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:52,434
ahead of you, and it would
expand to fill the housing.

618
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,894
Well, it should work.

619
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,689
I mean, the air
would be thin, but, uh...

620
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,440
you'd be able to breathe
for about 20 minutes.

621
00:30:58,482 --> 00:30:59,733
And then?

622
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,151
You'd pass out.

623
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,740
<i>We'd</i> pass out.

624
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,033
You're coming with me.

625
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,923
(<i> sighs</i> )

626
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,259
This might take
longer than I thought.

627
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,890
O'BRIEN:
All right.

628
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,934
If we beamed in
to the primary
safeties junction,

629
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:38,938
we should see a cluster
of heuristic subprocessors...

630
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,901
next to a rectilinear
expansion module.

631
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,403
The question is:

632
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:47,489
What does a rectilinear
expansion module look like

633
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:49,908
when you're one
centimeter tall?

634
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,577
What?

635
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,871
I haven't the faintest idea...

636
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,789
but it's amazing.

637
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:59,042
It's like we're in the middle
of an optronic forest.

638
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,836
Looks like
we need to go...

639
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:02,796
Julian,
stop!

640
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,465
That chip behind you

641
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,300
is carrying
20 microamps

642
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:10,220
of electric current.
Now that's not very much--

643
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:14,767
But it's enough to fry
every synapse in my tiny body.

644
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:16,643
Thanks for the tip.

645
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,231
All right,
stay right behind me.

646
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,652
And don't touch anything
without asking.

647
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:28,071
Believe me, I won't.

648
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,422
The white.

649
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:51,303
It is time.

650
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:00,228
How's it coming, Chief?

651
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,980
We're making progress.

652
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,565
Aren't we, Chief?

653
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:04,650
I'm still trying to locate

654
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,360
the security protocol
interlink.

655
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,738
It shouldn't take
much longer.

656
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,114
Well, the sooner the better.

657
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,366
Things are getting
a little crowded up here.

658
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,343
We pledge our loyalties
to the Founders--

We're all Alphas here.

661

Our loyalty is
demonstrated

662
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,767
by our actions,
not our words.

663
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,232
All right.

664
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,192
Now...

665
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,568
Miles...

666
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:51,488
we're lost, aren't we?

667
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,198
Yes, we're lost.

668
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:56,994
I can draw
these circuits

669
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,037
in my sleep.

670
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:01,331
I've just...
never seen them

671
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:02,749
from this perspective.

672
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,668
Disorientation--

673
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,837
it's one of the
effects of hypoxia--

674
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:08,797
lack of oxygen.

675
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:12,342
Need to focus
on a landmark.

676
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,593
There.

677
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:15,637
That large isolinear chip--

678
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,058
number 58966 stroke delta.

679
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,267
What is it?

680
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:24,688
Julian, there are
two dozen 66/deltas

681
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,774
in the asymmetric
encryption circuits alone.

682
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,153
All right, then
what-- what's this

683
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,697
here at its base?

684
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:36,449
Well, that's a four-way
interlink shunt.

685
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,494
So... that would mean
that this chip is...?

686

(<i> sighs</i> )
I don't know!

687
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,416
I told you that they
all look the same to me.

688
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,458
All right,
don't look at it.

689
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,920
What?!
Close your eyes.

690
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:50,088
Use your memory.

00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:55,260
Okay. There's a four-way
shunt at the base

00:34:55,301 --> 00:35:00,348
of a 58966 stroke delta
isolinear chip...

694
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,851
which is where?

695
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:07,856
The only four-way
shunt near a 66/delta

696
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:10,149
is at the base...

697
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:13,946
of the master
differential relay.

698
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:15,154
That's got to be it.

699
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:19,534
So the interlink we want
has to be...?

700
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:20,994
That way.

(<i> both panting</i> )

710
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,973
Which one?

711
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,433
That one.

712
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:26,685
(<i> panting</i> )

713
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,353
No, no, no.

714
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,980
(panting<i> )</i>

715
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:31,023
That one.

716
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:32,649
You sure?

717
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,794
Oh...

718
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,713
Again.

719
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,059
Julian.

720
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,233
(<i> both panting</i> )

721
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:20,279
<i>Rub-Rubicon...</i>

722
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,910
m-mission complete.

723
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,919
Oh, I am good.

724
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,795
Come with me.

725
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:39,424
All of you,
step away from the consoles!

726
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,134
Right now!

727
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,847
Captain, I did it.

728
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:48,600
I don't know how,
but I released
the command codes.

729
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:51,644
Well done.
What we need now
is a diversion

730
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,397
before they go to warp.
Silence!

731
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:57,483
(<i> coughs</i> )

732
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:01,613
All the<i> Defiant's</i>
command functions

733
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,823
have been transferred
to Engineering...

734
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,158
but nothing's happening.

735
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,284
Well, maybe the Captain
doesn't realize

736
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,744
he has control of the ship yet.

737
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,955
Or maybe
he's in trouble.

738
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,372
The First was called
to the Engine Room

739
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,624
a few minutes ago.

740
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:23,635
How long has the warp drive
been repaired?

741
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:27,055
At least one hour...
maybe longer.

742
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:30,600
And they managed
to conceal it from you?

743
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,727
You ordered me not
to interfere with them.

744
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,313
I also told you
to watch them carefully.

745
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,274
If we had assigned
Jem'Hadar

746
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,775
to do the repair,
as I said--

747
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:41,861
I am not interested
in your excuses.

748
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,655
Bring the warp drive
on line.

749
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,077
Wait.

750
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,622
Before we activate
the warp drive,

751
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,958
we should check
the entire system

752
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,751
for possible sabotage.

753
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,213
That would take hours--
every minute we spend

754
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:03,549
in Federation space
exposes us to detection
and attack,

755
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,052
and I would hate
for your last mission

756
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:09,055
to end in failure,<i> Elder.</i>

757
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,182
Do it.

758
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,774
And when you have
sufficient engine
power available,

759
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,609
bring us to warp 4.

760
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:24,487
At least we're going
to take them with us.

761
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:25,947
FIRST:
Secure these four

762
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:27,740
with the other prisoners.

763
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,254
(<i> groans</i> )

764
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,593
Dax, upper rail.
I've got him.

765
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,773
(<i> grunting, coughing</i> )

766
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:11,659
This guy is really starting
to get on my nerves.

767
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,578
I have torpedo lock.
Fire!

768
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,042
(<i> grunting</i> )

769
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:30,678
(<i> growling</i> )

770
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:36,517
I'm flooding
all the compartments

771
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,561
except the Engine Room
with anesthezine gas.

772
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,438
Major, get that virus
out of the computer

773
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,190
before someone
on the Bridge

774
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:43,149
engages the warp drive.

775
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,276
Aye, sir.

776
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,071
SISKO:
He should have listened
to you and killed me

777
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:49,822
when he had the chance.

778
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,743
He was a First.

779
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:56,788
They don't need... to...

780
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:57,997
listen.

781
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,917
Obedience brings

782
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:05,463
victory, and victory is...

783
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,924
(<i> gasps</i> )

784
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:14,931
(<i> runabout approaching</i> )

785
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:22,272
Mr. Worf, I think
your wife is here.

786
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:36,035
SISKO:
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

787
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,412
<i>After completing repairs,</i>

788
00:41:37,454 --> 00:41:39,331
<i>we were able to return</i>
<i>to the anomaly</i>

789
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:41,958
<i>and successfully restore</i>
<i>our runabout and its crew</i>

790
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,793
<i>to their normal size.</i>

791
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,378
<i>The surviving Jem'Hadar</i>

792
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,798
<i>have been transferred</i>
<i>to a Federation P.O.W. camp.</i>

793
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,508
Is that your poem?

794
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:52,385
Yes.

795
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:55,347
Bloodwine.

796
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:56,722
Can I hear it?

797
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:58,850
It is not finished yet.

798
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:02,061
Oh, please?
Just the first line?

799
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,272
All right.

800
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:05,815
But it is my first poem.

801
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,733
I understand.

802
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,153
And I have worked very long
and very hard on this.

803
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:11,363
I know.

804
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:13,490
I do not wish
to be ridiculed.

805
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,283
I promise.

806
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:16,575
Very well.

807
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,787
"This is the story

808
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:23,124
of the little ship
that took a little trip."

809
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,044
What do you think?

810
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:32,425
It's, uh...

811
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:33,968
Well, it rhymes.

812
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,850
There's nothing on this padd.

813
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,728
(<i> laughing</i> )

814
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,857
BASHIR:
We were just minding
our own business

815
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:49,942
when suddenly, right
there in front of us

816
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,028
was this immense
Jem'Hadar.

817
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,906
He looked as tall
as a Seltan carnosaur.

818
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,324
We were so close,

819
00:42:56,366 --> 00:43:00,203
you could see the veins
in his eyeballs throbbing.

820
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:01,454
We swung around

821
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:03,081
and ducked behind
the operations console.

822
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,832
I knew we had to get
our sensors back on line

823
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:06,167
if we were going
to be of any help

824
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:07,668
to the Captain
and the others.

825
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,462
So I said to Julian...

826
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:12,215
Is there
something wrong?

827
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:16,386
Are you sure you've returned
to your normal size?

828
00:43:17,429 --> 00:43:18,555
Of course.

829
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,850
Why?

830
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:24,894
Well, you both appear to be

831
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:26,354
a couple
of centimeters shorter

832
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:29,190
than you were
the last time I saw you.

833
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:32,569
A changeling notices
that sort of thing.

834
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,279
I didn't want
to say anything,

835
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,241
but you<i> do</i> look a little...

836
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:39,742
on the petite side.

837
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,248
Infirmary.

838
00:43:50,587 --> 00:43:54,048
And they say you don't
have a sense of humor.

839
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:56,217
(<i> grunts</i> )

840
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:57,927
(<i> both chuckle</i> )
