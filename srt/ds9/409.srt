1
00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:03,963
Walls of fire on one side,

2
00:00:03,963 --> 00:00:05,881
rivers of lava on the other.

3
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:09,927
We snaked our way through
the hot, smoldering canyon,

4
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:12,011
our skin
so parched and blistered

5
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:14,807
it was, it was
as thick as armor.

6
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:16,475
(<i> crowd murmurs</i> )

7
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:19,812
Kang and Koloth and I
had set out with 40 legions,

8
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:22,564
and now only we three remained
to take on T'nag's army.

9
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,399
Chanting a battle cry...

10
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,152
You know what I like
about Klingon stories,
Commander?

11
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,195
...his eyes bulging...

12
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,237
Nothing.

13
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,031
Lots of people die,

14
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,951
and nobody
makes any profit.

15
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:38,121
...his<i> bat'leth</i> in the other,
I saw him kill two dozen men.

16
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:41,124
Do you believe
a word of this?

17
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:44,461
Snaking along rivers of lava,
past walls of fire...

18
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,005
not very likely.

19
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:47,673
Three against an army?

20
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,048
Even more unlikely.

21
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:51,050
Yeah, but who cares?
He tells it well.

22
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:56,139
Kang took the high ground,
and keeping the three suns
to his back,

23
00:00:56,139 --> 00:01:01,436
he forced the enemy to fight him
against the blinding light.

24
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,314
When Kang told the story,
you took the high ground.

25
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,608
Who gets the credit
is of no importance.

26
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,736
What matters is this:

27
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:14,033
In the end, the mountainside was
covered with dead, so that not

28
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:17,452
one square meter of
ground could be seen.

29
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:20,998
We found T'nag's body...

30
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:24,835
by the river,
its waters red with blood.

31
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,798
Which of us had slain him...

32
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:33,468
no one could say for certain,
so...

33
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,930
we cut out his heart,

34
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,432
and all three of us...

35
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,142
feasted on it together.

36
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,978
Big heart.

37
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,605
(<i> all chuckling</i> )

38
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,106
(<i> both laughing</i> )

39
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:49,109
You need more bloodwine.

40
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,361
Oh, thanks, but I've
had enough for a year.

41
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,614
What I need is tea.

42
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:00,287
Mr. Worf, I didn't
see you come in.

43
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,705
I was just about
to leave.

44
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:03,665
Join us. I'll
introduce you to Kor.

45
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,709
No!

46
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,754
It might make the<i> Dahar</i>
Master uncomfortable.

47
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:11,632
I am considered an outcast
by most Klingons.

48
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,384
Kor isn't like most Klingons.

49
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,886
Kor.
Hmm?

50
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,178
I have someone
I'd like you to meet.

51
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,346
Oh?

52
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,811
I'd like you to meet

53
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,396
our Strategic Operations
Officer,

54
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,189
Commander Worf.

55
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,484
Oh, Worf, the traitor.

56
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,944
The pariah.

57
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:35,906
The lowest
of the low.

58
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,871
It's a pleasure to meet you.

59
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,082
Any enemy of Gowron

60
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,960
and the High Council
is a friend of mine.

61
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,213
This is a great honor.

62
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,715
Oh, no doubt.

63
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,634
Worf is a great admirer
of yours.

64
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:56,885
Ah.

65
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,053
Yes, please.

66
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,387
Oh.

67
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,555
I have heard
stories about you

68
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,932
since I was a child.

69
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,810
Your confrontation
with Kirk on Organia,

70
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,020
your attack on Romulus,

71
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,521
your defense
of the Korma Pass...

72
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,899
Everything I have done
pales in comparison

73
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,401
to what I am
about to achieve.

74
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,278
I am on a quest--

75
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,115
a quest for the most
revered icon

76
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,159
in Klingon history.

77
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,952
Kor...

78
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,872
An icon that predates
the Klingon Empire.

79
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,541
An icon more sacred
than the Torch of G'boj...

80
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,001
Kor...

81
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:30,335
more revered

82
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:35,215
than Sabak's armor,
and more coveted

83
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,759
than the Emperor's crown.

84
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,303
The Sword of Kahless.

85
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,972
Ah...

86
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,766
You told<i> me</i> not
to tell anybody.

87
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,560
He guessed.

88
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,730
I know where
the Sword rests.

89
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,566
Think of the
glory, the honor

90
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,609
of finding
the<i> bat'leth</i>

91
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,904
of the first
warrior king.

92
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,989
Lost for a millennium.

93
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:04,912
Its return
would change Klingon history.

94
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,872
If you know where it is,

95
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:09,083
we must bring it back
to the Emperor.

96
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,626
"We"?

97
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,880
It would be an honor
to accompany you,

98
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,840
<i>if</i> you will have me.

99
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,717
We could use another strong arm.

100
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,635
And a stout heart.

101
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,471
Besides, it will annoy Gowron.

102
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,890
(<i> chuckling</i> )

103
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,979
To return the Sword
to our people.

104
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,357
I would give my life
for that chance.

105
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,901
Children will
sing our names

106
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,694
for a thousand years.

107
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:41,406
They'll erect statues of us
in the hall of heroes.

108
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,993
DAX: Before you decide
on a pose for that statue,

109
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,204
we need to<i> find</i> the Sword.

110
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:50,249
What makes you so sure
you know where it is?

111
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,751
This.

112
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,378
Now, you see?

113
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,838
DAX:
See what?

114
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,715
The imprint
on the cloth.

115
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,801
Yes, yes...

116
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,552
this held
the Sword of Kahless.

117
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,097
Don't be so sure.
You could carpet this station

118
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,974
with all the "authentic"
Shrouds of the Sword

119
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,225
that people have tried
to peddle.

120
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,227
No one tried to peddle this.

121
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,519
It was<i> given</i> to me.

122
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,938
By whom?

123
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,731
I'll tell you everything later.

124
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,983
Now I need you

125
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,068
to confirm
its authenticity.

126
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,403
I'll look it over in the lab
first thing in the morning.

127
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,822
Why not right now?

128
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,908
Right now, my head
is swimming in bloodwine

129
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,869
and I'm going to bed
and so should you.

130
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,579
Oh, absolutely.

131
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,249
As soon as I finish
what's left in my cup.

132
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:35,919
<i>Maj ram,</i> blood brother.

133
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,587
<i>Maj ram.</i>

134
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,719
Imagine the look
on Gowron's face

135
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:48,223
when we present the Sword
to the Emperor.

136
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,808
(<i> chuckling</i> )

137
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:58,317
(<i> humming</i> )

138
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,654
MALE:
Kor...

139
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,573
(<i> electrical sparking</i> )

140
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,575
(<i> gagging</i> )

141
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,579
(<i> sighs deeply</i> )

142
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,587
Open your mind.

143
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,420
(<i> door chimes</i> )

144
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,006
(<i> snorting</i> )

145
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:26,965
(<i> door chimes</i> )

146
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,425
Oh, what?

147
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,684
Hmm?
DAX: Couldn't find the bed?

148
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,978
(<i> grumbling</i> )

149
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,314
Damn that Ferengi

150
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:45,817
and his replicated bloodwine.

151
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,987
Worf looked
a little bleary-eyed
in Ops this morning.

152
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,780
How late did you
keep him up?

153
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,659
Until that toad-faced Ferengi
threw us out of his bar.

154
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,078
And then where did you go?

155
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,122
(<i> mumbling</i> )

156
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:02,542
Worf's quarters, I-I think.

157
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,669
Oh, that's right.

158
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,255
He had
a bottle of Yridian brandy

159
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:10,008
he was saving
for a special occasion.

160
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,885
Like meeting you.

161
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,514
Well, he was honored
to join our quest.

162
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:18,558
That is,
if there's going to be a quest.

163
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,143
What did you find?

164
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:24,231
I found both Klingon
and Hur'q DNA on the cloth

165
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,900
and traces
of metallic compounds

166
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,653
that could only have been left
by a Klingon<i> bat'leth.</i>

167
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,407
A<i> bat'leth...</i>

168
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,575
1,400 years old.

169
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,870
The time of Kahless!

170
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,664
Ah! I never doubted it.

171
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,208
Oh, when do we leave?

172
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:47,254
After I talk
to Captain Sisko,

173
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,882
and after you answer
a few questions.

174
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,343
Now where did you
get this?

175
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,390
The Gamma Quadrant?

176
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,434
A Vulcan geological
survey team

177
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:03,061
was mining bakrinium
on an uncharted planet

178
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:06,523
when they accidentally
unearthed some ancient ruins.

179
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,942
They brought back
several artifacts to study,

180
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,402
including the cloth.

181
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,612
Kor was the Klingon
ambassador to Vulcan.

182
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,072
When he saw the cloth,

183
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,656
Kor recognized
the markings

184
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,825
and got them to give it
to him as a gift.

185
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,995
They didn't realize it,
but the markings were Hur'q.

186
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,582
Hur'q...

187
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:27,502
that's the Klingon word
for outsiders, isn't it?

188
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:28,962
Yes. The Hur'q
invaded our homeworld

189
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,464
over 1,000 years ago.

190
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:33,341
Whatever they could not pillage,
they destroyed.

191
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,926
They took the Sword,

192
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:38,054
and my people have been
searching for it ever since.

193
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,516
It is said its return
will bring back

194
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:44,436
a new era of glory
for the Klingon Empire.

195
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:46,563
With the Sword,
the Emperor will be able

196
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,189
to unite my people
once again.

197
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,899
And if two Starfleet officers

198
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,818
were involved
in recovering the Sword,

199
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,653
that might go a long way

200
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,072
toward patching things up
between the Klingons and us.

201
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,698
WORF:
That is my hope
as well, Captain.

202
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,659
What about you, old man?

203
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,120
You want to go along
for the adventure.

204
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,746
Hard to pass up
a good quest.

205
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,166
I suppose
you'll want a runabout.

206
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,462
WORF:
The, uh,<i> Rio Grande</i> 
is available.

207
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,632
Try to bring it back
in one piece.

208
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:15,133
We'll do our best.

209
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,719
Benjamin, thanks.

210
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,411
Mr. Worf, lay in a course
for the wormhole.

211
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,414
Course laid in.

212
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,499
Ahead half...

213
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:48,707
Wait.

214
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:52,837
Let this moment be remembered.

215
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,714
For on this day, we three,

216
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:58,301
Kor,<i> Dahar</i> Master
of the Klingons,

217
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:02,514
Jadzia Dax,
a joined Trill of seven lives,

218
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:07,726
and Worf, son of Mogh
and thorn in Gowron's side...

219
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:16,277
together stepped forth
into the eye of destiny.

220
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,404
Now?

221
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,367
Now.

222
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,869
Ahead half thrusters.

223
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,924
Glorious.

224
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,267
Hey.

225
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,643
Forgive me, Commander.

226
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,687
It's a little
crowded in here.

227
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,690
I would have used the aft
quarters for my exercise,

228
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,609
but the<i> Dahar</i> Master
is resting.

229
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,903
I know, I heard him snoring
through the bulkhead.

230
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,077
Commander.

231
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:07,621
I wish to thank you

232
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,414
for introducing
me to Kor.

233
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,165
It is an honor
to be here.

234
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,167
And I'm glad
he invited you,

235
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,129
even if it does make things
a little crowded.

236
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:20,467
(<i> gargling</i> )

237
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,139
KOR:
Oh, I slept

238
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,266
like an Alvanian
cave sloth.

239
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:33,521
Oh, but I had
the most magnificent dream.

240
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:37,150
I dreamt the three of us
were in the Hall of Heroes,

241
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,860
presenting the<i> bat'leth</i>
to the Emperor.

242
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,363
We stood
near the statues

243
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,906
of Kang and Koloth,

244
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,283
and as the crowd

245
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,035
sang out our names...

246
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:52,290
the most
astonishing thing happened.

247
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,669
Their statues came to life.

248
00:13:55,669 --> 00:14:00,131
Kang and Koloth were
flesh and blood again,

249
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:04,051
and we held the Sword high!

250
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:13,019
Kang, Koloth and Kor...

251
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,854
together again.

252
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:28,284
We have assumed
a standard orbit.

253
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,703
I'm reading a series

254
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,496
of interconnected
structures and tunnels

255
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,748
several kilometers
beneath the surface.

256
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:36,710
And that is all that
remains of the Hur'q,

257
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:40,296
the great plunderers
of the galaxy.

258
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,424
And now it is time for us
to reclaim what is ours.

259
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,635
Assuming we can find
where to look.

260
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,637
It's a big planet.

261
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,390
The Vulcan survey team
was meticulous.

262
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:54,519
They mapped the entire area
during their mining operation.

263
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,689
Now, the Sword should be
in the chamber

264
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,233
that once was
the Central Museum,

265
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:04,987
along with all the other great
treasures looted by the Hur'q.

266
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,782
It's the structure
furthest north.

267
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,119
There is a force field
around that chamber.

268
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:15,206
The Vulcans told me
they couldn't get through it.

269
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,375
We'll be the first inside.

270
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,127
Why didn't you mention
this force field before?

271
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,588
Oh, it's not important.

272
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,172
I'll know you'll get past it.

273
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,641
We should be just outside
the force field.

274
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,697
The main chamber
must be back there.

275
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:48,740
Let's get to work.

276
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,952
First we need to modulate
the field destabilizers

277
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,705
to create
an interference pattern.

278
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,918
It's not working.

279
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,377
Try reversing
the polarity.

280
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,382
That helped.

281
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,259
Now, if we can just
increase the amplitude

282
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,595
of the interference field.

283
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,226
Well done, my friends.

284
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,271
The air.

285
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:23,023
Foul, isn't it?

286
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,443
This place has been undisturbed

287
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:26,861
for hundreds of years.

288
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,362
Come!

289
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,341
It's been ransacked.

290
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,512
The Vulcans may not
have gotten in here,

291
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,555
but someone did.

292
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,607
DAX: Whoever did this
has taken everything.

293
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,193
I'm sorry, Kor.

294
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,449
Don't be sorry for me.
Be sorry for the Empire.

295
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,409
If we could find out
who did this,

296
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,787
we might be able
to track them down.

297
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,330
For all we know,

298
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,875
the Sword is halfway across
the galaxy by now.

299
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,626
Sounds like
a worthy quest.

300
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:27,922
For you and Worf, perhaps,
but not for me.

301
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:31,718
My last chance for glory
dies here.

302
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,679
WORF: Commander,
take a look at this.

303
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:43,270
The dust... it does not
reach the wall.

304
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,982
Something must
be repelling it.

305
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:49,443
I'm getting a faint
electrostatic charge
along this section.

306
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,530
Another force field?

307
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,449
Masked by
a holographic projection.

308
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,951
Are you saying

309
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,537
there may be another
chamber behind it?

310
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:02,582
If there is, I don't know
how we can get into it.

311
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:06,836
This shield has completely
different harmonics
than the one in the entrance.

312
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,463
This... this is a sensor
focused on the area

313
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,799
directly in front
of the force field.

314
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,968
It must be keyed
to read life signs.

315
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:15,970
Why?

316
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,347
So only the Hur'q can enter?

317
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,975
If you're right, we're going
to need a Hur'q tour guide

318
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,476
to get us through.

319
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,605
We may be able to fool
the sensor into thinking

320
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,607
that we are Hur'q.

321
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:31,611
We can reconfigure the tricorder
to emit Hur'q life signs.

322
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,112
Exactly.

323
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,114
I still have
the DNA readings

324
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,699
we got from the cloth.

325
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,618
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

326
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,003
I feel like a Hur'q already.

327
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,805
WORF:
I cannot believe it.

328
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,727
For a thousand years,

329
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:09,983
our people have dreamed
of this moment.

330
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:12,944
The age, the composition,
the design--

331
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,737
everything's right.

332
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,072
How can you doubt it?

333
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,406
Look at it!

334
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,492
It's more beautiful
than I imagined.

335
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,999
You should be the
first to hold it.

336
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,218
How does it feel?

337
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,179
Good.

338
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:44,266
Very, very good.

339
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:52,817
To think, Kahless himself
once held this<i> bat'leth.</i>

340
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:03,452
With this he slew Molor,

341
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,579
conquered the<i> Fek'Ihri,</i>

342
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,207
and forged the First Empire.

343
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:12,962
And now, I hold it
in my hands.

344
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,219
We should go.

345
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,514
The field destabilizers
won't hold for long.

346
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,311
KLINGON:
Stop where you are!

347
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,814
Well, Kor,

348
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,983
seems you were right.

349
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,484
You did find the Sword.

350
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,486
Who are you?

351
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,072
Ask your friend.

352
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:44,160
This is Toral from
the House of Duras.

353
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,204
It is good
to see you, too, Worf.

354
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,374
Seems<i> you</i> were too drunk
to remember me

355
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,085
or the tavern
on Torna IV?

356
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,878
You held us
all spellbound

357
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,922
with a tale of a Hur'q cloth

358
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:59,466
and how it was going
to lead you to the Sword.

359
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:02,929
I was so intrigued
that I sent my friend here

360
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,889
to see what else
you knew.

361
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,266
What do you want?
What we all want.

362
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,684
The Sword.

363
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,770
The Sword is for the Emperor.

364
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,646
Who will be
so grateful,

365
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,232
he'll give Kor his statue

366
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:17,068
and perhaps even forgive
your dishonor?

367
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:19,862
I'm afraid I have different
plans for the Sword.

368
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,573
You think that if you give
the emperor the Sword,

369
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:25,952
he will restore your family's
seat on the High Council.

370
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:28,328
I'm not giving
the emperor anything.

371
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:31,832
With the Sword in my hand,
<i>I'll</i> be leading the Empire.

372
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,127
I can see from
your face, Worf,

373
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:36,712
that you regret
having spared my life.

374
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,715
Now give it to me.

375
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,676
No.

376
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:45,138
Then I'm afraid
we'll have to take it.

377
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,766
If he wants it...

378
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,101
give it to him.

379
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,695
(<i> grunting</i> )

380
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,590
Let's go!

381
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,052
(<i> groans</i> )

382
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:47,658
(<i> cries out</i> )

383
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,453
(<i> yells</i> )

384
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,250
We need to stop
the bleeding.

385
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,877
We better get you
up to the ship.

386
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,586
Dax to<i> Rio Grande.</i>

387
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:02,506
(<i> pulsating static</i> )

388
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,550
That is a Klingon
jamming signal.

389
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,801
Can we override it?

390
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,303
Maybe from the surface.

391
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,888
Kor, go make sure no
one's following us.

392
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:12,225
Did you see the look
on the face

393
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:13,893
of that Klingon
that I killed?

394
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:17,646
It was as if he understood
the honor bestowed upon him.

395
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,107
The first man
in a thousand years

396
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,984
to be killed
by the Sword of Kahless.

397
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,195
I'm sure he was
very proud.

398
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:25,863
We should keep moving.

399
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,740
Toral<i> will</i> find a way
past the force field.

400
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:38,500
Why did Toral say that
you had spared his life?

401
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,753
When it was discovered
that the House of Duras

402
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,089
had conspired to destroy
my father's honor,

403
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:46,175
Gowron offered me
Toral's life.

404
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,426
Under the Right
of Vengeance.

405
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:49,595
I declined.

406
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,390
Why?

407
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,432
He was a boy.
He had done nothing.

408
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:55,976
That's beside
the point.

409
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,228
It was a matter
of honor.

410
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:58,938
It was Worf's right
to decline.

411
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,148
It was a mistake.

412
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,651
Perhaps what they say about you

413
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:07,196
is true.

414
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,489
You've been around humans
too long.

415
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,033
Kor!

416
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,952
If he hadn't spared
Toral's life,

417
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,828
we'd be on the way to Kronos.

418
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,747
And if you had not been drunk

419
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:18,791
and told a tavern full of people
what you were planning,

420
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,459
Toral would not have followed us
here in the first place.

421
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,421
I told them nothing
of consequence.

422
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:26,464
How could I know that Toral
was going send a Lethean

423
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:27,716
to steal my thoughts?

424
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,509
You should have been
more discreet.

425
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,845
And<i> you</i> should have been
more of a Klingon.

426
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,105
Kor, what was that
all about?

427
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:42,148
Hmm?

428
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:44,566
Worf admires you.

429
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,859
(<i> snorts</i> )

430
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,361
You have no idea
how much it meant

431
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,196
for him to be invited
on this journey.

432
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,740
Tell me, Dax, how well
do you know him?

433
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,534
Well enough. Why?

434
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,120
I'm beginning to think

435
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,372
I was too lenient
in my judgment of him.

436
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:01,625
Any Klingon who denies himself
the Right of Vengeance

437
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,210
is no Klingon at all.

438
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,838
He dishonors the Sword
with his presence.

439
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:08,257
I don't trust him.

440
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:13,679
I should have let him stay
on that space station

441
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,681
where he belongs.

442
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,237
(<i> whispers</i> ):
Worf.

443
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,343
<i>HoH!</i>

444
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:02,311
(<i> grunts</i> )

445
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,313
DAX:
What is it?

446
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,106
Lunch.

447
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,988
Delicious, isn't it?

448
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,823
A hunt builds
the appetite.

449
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,492
It's disgusting.

450
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,785
Ah, but it'll make
a good part of the story--

451
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,578
how we slew the beast?
Remember?

452
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:23,290
It attacked us from the dark,
five meters long.

453
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,918
DAX:
Oh, ten at least.

454
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,879
Eyes ablaze,
fangs like daggers.

455
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:30,797
Breathing great
plumes of fire.

456
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:31,882
(<i> laughing</i> )

457
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:39,557
Oh, it seems the son of Mogh
is not amused.

458
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:43,227
A true warrior has no need
to exaggerate his feats.

459
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:44,811
KOR:
You'd better hope

460
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,480
that I exaggerate

461
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,816
or else when they start
singing songs about this quest,

462
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,110
and come to your verse,

463
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,446
it will be,
"and Worf came along."

464
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:55,072
(<i> laughing</i> )

465
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:58,742
(<i> grunting</i>
<i>with pleasure</i> )

466
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:03,289
This is the Sword of Kahless.

467
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,583
It is not something
to shovel food

468
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:07,042
into your mouth.

469
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:11,880
It must be treated with honor.

470
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,927
Hmm, hmm, hmm, look at him.

471
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:18,596
He's like the Hur'q.

472
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:21,223
He thinks
it's a museum piece.

473
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:23,058
(<i> laughing</i> )

474
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:26,812
Why, Kahless himself used it
to skin the serpent of Xol

475
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,981
to harvest his father's field

476
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,691
to carve a statue
of his own beloved.

477
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,193
It's a sword!

478
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,239
But Worf doesn't know
what to do with it,

479
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,366
except bow before it

480
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:43,162
and then hand it over
to his precious emperor.

481
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:46,706
And when we do, you will get
your precious statue

482
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:49,627
and after they have sung songs
about you,

483
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:52,712
and you have passed out
from too much drink,

484
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:56,383
the emperor will use the Sword
to unite our people.

485
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,093
If Gowron allows him.

486
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,263
The emperor
is merely his puppet.

487
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,223
The emperor is no one's puppet.

488
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,892
He condemned Gowron's invasion
of Cardassia.

489
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,060
And the invasion

490
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,771
went ahead
despite his objection.

491
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:12,608
That is why the emperor
needs the Sword.

492
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:16,153
It will allow him to unify
the Houses against Gowron.

493
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:22,117
The emperor is a pretender,
a clone of the original Kahless,

494
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:25,204
cooked up in a vat
by ambitious clerics.

495
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:28,706
And if you hadn't supported him,
he'd be right back in that vat

496
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,250
where he came from.

497
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,378
I supported him
because we need him.

498
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:33,879
He can unite us.

499
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:37,424
The Sword will unite us

500
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:40,969
if it's held
by a true Klingon,

501
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:44,473
not a politician like Gowron

502
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:48,727
or some toothless figurehead
like the emperor.

503
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,480
The Sword must rest
in the hands of someone

504
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,441
who has been
hardened by battle,

505
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,609
pure of heart,

506
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:58,945
who understands loyalty,
and honor.

507
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:01,532
A warrior like Kang and Koloth.

508
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,867
Someone like you?

509
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:14,961
The Empire could do far worse.

510
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,092
We should
get moving.

511
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:22,511
Are you saying
it is your intention

512
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:23,970
to lead the Empire?

513
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,014
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
Ah...

514
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:29,851
I'm saying it's my intention
to lead us to the surface.

515
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,706
We have to change
your bandage.

516
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,750
No. We must
keep moving.

517
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,293
You're hemorrhaging.

518
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:55,835
We have to stop
the bleeding.

519
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,471
That cave-rat
was all bones.

520
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,055
I need another one.

521
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,099
Find a nice fat one.

522
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:11,184
We all could use
something to eat.

523
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,482
He never answered
my question

524
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:18,191
about his plans
for the Sword.

525
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,193
I noticed.

526
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,738
He is a hero to many.

527
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:25,532
If he brings it back
with him to Kronos,

528
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,535
and decides to seize power,
many will follow him.

529
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,120
But you wouldn't?

530
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,955
He is not all
I thought he was.

531
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,540
Maybe not.

532
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,958
Sorry.

533
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,335
But I've known him
a long time

534
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,753
and his heart's
in the right place.

535
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,505
He drinks too much.

536
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:41,507
He exaggerates
his feats.

537
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:44,009
He blames others
for his own mistakes

538
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,762
but he could be right
about one thing.

539
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:50,098
The emperor may be too weak
to stand against Gowron,

540
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,475
even with the Sword.

541
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:54,728
I thought you believed
in the emperor.

542
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:57,189
I do not know what
I believe anymore.

543
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,733
All I know is when Kor
asked me to help him

544
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:03,403
find the Sword,
I knew we would succeed.

545
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,030
I knew we would find it.

546
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,574
I can't say I felt
the same way.

547
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,368
I had no doubt.

548
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:13,913
I felt as if my life
was finally coming into focus.

549
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,207
What do you mean?

550
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,710
For as long
as I can remember,

551
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,628
I have always been
an outsider.

552
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:22,172
I was raised by humans,

553
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:24,174
but I was too Klingon
to be one of them.

554
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,055
I did not belong.

555
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:34,267
I begged my foster parents

556
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,895
to allow me to visit
the Klingon Homeworld.

557
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,398
They arranged for me to stay
with my cousin's family.

558
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:43,985
When I first set eyes
on the Great Domes of Kronos,

559
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,279
I felt that I had
finally come home.

560
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,243
But my own cousins wanted
nothing to do with me.

561
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,661
You were
too human

562
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,120
to be one of them.

563
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,915
I ran away into
the mountains.

564
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:00,586
I was without food or water
for three days.

565
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:03,547
But there,
in the caves of No'Mat,

566
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:05,965
Kahless appeared to me
in a vision and told me

567
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:08,427
I would do something
no other Klingon had ever done.

568
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,555
After I returned to Earth,

569
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,390
I pondered the meaning
of his words

570
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,100
and wondered
what lay ahead for me.

571
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:21,481
When I was old enough,
I joined Starfleet.

572
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,692
Something no Klingon
had ever done.

573
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:27,195
For a time, I thought that
I had fulfilled my destiny,

574
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:30,949
but now I see Kahless had
something else in mind for me.

575
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,786
Something... something greater.

576
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:36,580
That is why I had to endure
so much pain.

577
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,957
Why I was forced to choose
between the Federation

578
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,333
and my own people.

579
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,168
I was being tested.

580
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:46,005
Prepared for some...
some greater purpose.

581
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,258
Like finding the Sword.
More than that.

582
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:50,260
When I held
the Sword in my hand,

583
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,263
I felt the spirit of Kahless
himself had guided me to it.

584
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:56,767
Don't you see?
He wants me to have it.

585
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:59,603
He wants me to lead his people!

586
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:01,855
You sound like Kor.

587
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:03,899
Kor is an old man.

588
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:07,527
His greatest days
are behind him,

589
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:10,823
and mine are still ahead.
Then we have a
bit of a problem.

590
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:13,784
There's only one Sword,
and you both want it.

591
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,755
KOR:
How much further?

592
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:29,842
DAX: The way
these caves wind around,
this could take forever.

593
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:30,968
(<i> grunting</i> )

594
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:46,358
Or longer.

595
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,944
KOR:
We can't get across.

596
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:52,322
We'll go back
and find another way up.

597
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:54,407
Wait.

598
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,618
There.

599
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,350
(<i> yelling</i> )

600
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:27,941
(<i> groaning</i> )

601
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:30,235
WORF:
Kor, there's a ledge

602
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,277
right below you.

603
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:35,407
I don't see it.

604
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:37,200
It is less than
one meter down.

605
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,077
Let go and you'll
land on it.

606
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,079
Dax, can you see it?

607
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,917
I can't see anything.

608
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:47,252
(<i> groaning</i> )

609
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:49,629
I can't hold you.

610
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,631
You'll have to let go!

611
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,009
There is no ledge!

612
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:56,511
It is there!
Then you let go.

613
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,888
No.

614
00:34:57,888 --> 00:35:00,015
We cannot risk losing the Sword.

615
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:01,307
Let go!

616
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:04,185
I'll take the
Sword to my grave

617
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,063
before I give it to you.

618
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,566
Just hold on.

619
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,568
We'll pull you up.

620
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:22,537
(<i> both groaning</i> )

621
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,600
You call that a ledge?

622
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,435
It would
have been sufficient.

623
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:46,979
For a Degebian mountain goat,

624
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:48,563
not a Klingon warrior.

625
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,273
You were going to let me fall.

626
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,650
You wanted me to die,

627
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,610
so you can keep
the Sword for yourself.

628
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,904
And you were willing to take
the Sword to your death

629
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:59,282
and rob our people
of their future.
Give it to me!

630
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,747
That's enough,
both of you!

631
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,250
I will not give him the Sword.

632
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,753
Then give it to me.
<i>I'll</i> carry it.

633
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,466
Kor, put away your dagger.

634
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,468
Are you siding with him?

635
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:21,847
Put away your dagger,
so he can give me the<i> bat'leth.</i>

636
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:45,829
You see? I was right.

637
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:49,332
He's not to be trusted.

638
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,921
His mind has been poisoned

639
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,674
with bloodwine and age.

640
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:59,176
He was right
about one thing.

641
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,845
You wanted him to fall.

642
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:04,430
That ledge would
have never supported him

643
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,849
and you knew it.

644
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,311
I did not force him
off that cliff.

645
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,814
He is old and clumsy.

646
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:14,733
If he'd have fallen,

647
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,693
it would have been
his own fault.

648
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,414
I'm exhausted.

649
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:37,797
Commander...

650
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,056
we can rest in here
for a few hours.

651
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:47,432
I'm so tired

652
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,517
I think I might
be able to sleep.

653
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,728
I will take
the first watch.

654
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:54,898
(<i> laughing</i> ):
How generous of you.

655
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:58,151
And we'll just curl up
like trusting children

656
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,820
under your vigilant gaze.

657
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,781
Sleep or do not sleep.

658
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:05,033
It makes no
difference to me.

659
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,202
You're wounded.
I should take the first watch.

660
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,662
<i>You</i> get some rest.

661
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:13,625
<i>You</i> close your eyes.

662
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,711
I am not tired.

663
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,047
Hmm...

664
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,557
(<i> sighing</i> )

665
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:37,274
I understand.

666
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:40,318
It's hard to sleep
in the presence

667
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,403
of something so magnificent.

668
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:46,407
Someone might try
to steal it.

669
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,827
You reveal your own intentions.

670
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,453
Enough.

671
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,915
I have the Sword,
and it's not going anywhere.

672
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,424
What was that?

673
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,886
I heard nothing.

674
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,138
KOR:
A voice.

675
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:09,931
I hear it again.

676
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:13,852
It's the spirit of Kahless.

677
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:16,146
He's talking
to you, Worf.

678
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:18,231
He's telling you

679
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:19,941
to bide your time.

680
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,860
Let them sleep

681
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:27,657
and then slit their throats
and claim your destiny.

682
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:31,953
I have had enough of your
drunken ramblings, old man.

683
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:34,331
And I have had
enough of both of you.

00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:37,834
I don't care
if you sleep or not.

685
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,377
But I'm going to.

686
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,296
So be quiet.

His eyes.

00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:16,331
He has been staring
at me for three hours.

693

to sleep, then let's walk.

00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,381
Worf!

717
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,592
Stop!

718
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:57,140
(<i> both groaning loudly</i> )

719
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,391
(<i> sighs in frustration</i> )

720
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:09,444
Dax, I knew in the end
you'd choose me.

721
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:11,529
We're blood brothers.
Be quiet!

722
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,864
(<i> groans</i> )

723
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,914
<i>Now,</i> about that
jamming device

724
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:24,501
you're using to block
our communications.

725
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:45,230
Are you sure of this, Worf?

726
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,689
Yes.

727
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,233
(<i> sighing</i> )

728
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:51,152
Yes, it is
the only way.

729
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:52,945
Do we have the right?

730
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:56,282
This Sword belongs
to<i> all</i> Klingons.

731
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,868
But are we ready for it?

732
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:02,247
This Sword turned you and me
against each other.

733
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:04,749
Imagine how it would
divide the Empire.

734
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,503
Just let me hold it
one last time...

735
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:10,380
The Sword is not
meant for us.

736
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:14,175
It was never
our destiny to find it.

737
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:17,845
You're wrong.
It was our destiny to find it.

738
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,306
It just wasn't our destiny...

739
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,977
to keep it.

740
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:46,040
It is done.

741
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,917
Good. It's for the best.

742
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:49,752
I hope you're right.

743
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:52,838
It could be lost
for another thousand years.

744
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:59,554
When it is destined
to be found...

745
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,475
it will be.
