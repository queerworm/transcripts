1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,172
Walls of fire on one side

2
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:07,336
rivers of lava on the other.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,879
We snaked our way through
the hot, smoldering canyon

4
00:00:10,923 --> 00:00:13,122
our skin
so parched and blistered

5
00:00:13,163 --> 00:00:15,762
it was, it was
as thick as armor.

6
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:20,883
Kang and Koloth and I
had set out with 40 legions

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,454
and now only we three remained
to take on T'nag's army.

8
00:00:24,497 --> 00:00:25,466
Chanting a battle cry...

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,491
You know what I like

10
00:00:26,537 --> 00:00:28,235
about Klingon stories,
Commander?

11
00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:29,244
...his eyes bulging...

12
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:30,247
Nothing.

13
00:00:30,315 --> 00:00:32,150
Lots of people die

14
00:00:32,187 --> 00:00:34,991
and nobody
makes any profit.

15
00:00:35,029 --> 00:00:36,157
...his <i>bat'leth</i> in the other

16
00:00:36,199 --> 00:00:39,106
I saw him kill two dozen men.

17
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:42,048
Do you believe a word of this?

18
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,491
Snaking along rivers of lava,
past walls of fire...

19
00:00:45,527 --> 00:00:47,157
not very likely.

20
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:48,691
Three against an army?

21
00:00:48,736 --> 00:00:50,263
Even more unlikely.

22
00:00:50,307 --> 00:00:52,302
Yeah, but who cares?
He tells it well.

23
00:00:52,347 --> 00:00:54,251
Kang took the high ground

24
00:00:54,286 --> 00:00:57,660
and keeping the three suns
to his back

25
00:00:57,696 --> 00:01:03,077
he forced the enemy to fight him
against the blinding light.

26
00:01:03,113 --> 00:01:05,712
When Kang told the story,
you took the high ground.

27
00:01:05,754 --> 00:01:08,159
Who gets the credit
is of no importance.

28
00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:09,424
What matters is this:

29
00:01:09,465 --> 00:01:15,541
In the end, the mountainside was
covered with dead, so that not

30
00:01:15,584 --> 00:01:18,890
one square meter of ground
could be seen.

31
00:01:18,927 --> 00:01:22,563
We found T'nag's body...

32
00:01:22,605 --> 00:01:26,606
by the river,
its waters red with blood.

33
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:31,358
Which of us had slain him...

34
00:01:31,465 --> 00:01:35,101
no one could say for certain,
so...

35
00:01:35,142 --> 00:01:37,479
we cut out his heart

36
00:01:37,516 --> 00:01:39,853
and all three of us...

37
00:01:39,889 --> 00:01:42,624
feasted on it together.

38
00:01:42,665 --> 00:01:44,534
Big heart.

39
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:50,518
You need more bloodwine.

40
00:01:50,555 --> 00:01:52,858
Oh, thanks, but I've
had enough for a year.

41
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:55,300
What I need is tea.

42
00:01:59,515 --> 00:02:01,818
Mr. Worf,
I didn't see you come in.

43
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,120
I was just about to leave.

44
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:05,222
Join us.
I'll introduce you to Kor.

45
00:02:05,265 --> 00:02:07,169
No!

46
00:02:07,205 --> 00:02:10,203
It might make the <i>Dahar</i>
Master uncomfortable.

47
00:02:10,247 --> 00:02:13,245
I am considered an outcast
by most Klingons.

48
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:16,059
Kor isn't like most Klingons.

49
00:02:16,098 --> 00:02:17,294
- Kor.
- Hmm?

50
00:02:17,335 --> 00:02:18,703
I have someone
I'd like you to meet.

51
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:19,730
Oh?

52
00:02:24,021 --> 00:02:25,457
I'd like you to meet

53
00:02:25,526 --> 00:02:29,732
our Strategic Operations
Officer, Commander Worf.

54
00:02:29,772 --> 00:02:32,177
Oh, Worf, the traitor.

55
00:02:32,213 --> 00:02:33,581
The pariah.

56
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:37,755
The lowest of the low.

57
00:02:42,978 --> 00:02:44,471
It's a pleasure to meet you.

58
00:02:44,516 --> 00:02:46,511
Any enemy of Gowron

59
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,531
and the High Council
is a friend of mine.

60
00:02:49,632 --> 00:02:53,804
This is a great honor.

61
00:02:53,844 --> 00:02:55,246
Oh, no doubt.

62
00:02:55,282 --> 00:02:57,345
Worf is a great admirer
of yours.

63
00:02:57,388 --> 00:02:58,516
Ah.

64
00:02:58,558 --> 00:02:59,686
Yes, please.

65
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:01,029
Oh.

66
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:03,196
I have heard stories about you
since I was a child.

67
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,408
Your confrontation
with Kirk on Organia

68
00:03:06,448 --> 00:03:07,678
your attack on Romulus

69
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:08,847
your defense
of the Korma Pass...

70
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:12,388
Everything I have done
pales in comparison

71
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:14,906
to what I am about to achieve.

72
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:16,913
I am on a quest...

73
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,717
a quest for the most
revered icon

74
00:03:19,755 --> 00:03:21,920
in Klingon history.

75
00:03:21,962 --> 00:03:23,432
Kor...

76
00:03:23,466 --> 00:03:26,407
An icon that predates
the Klingon Empire.

77
00:03:26,442 --> 00:03:29,281
An icon more sacred
than the Torch of G'boj...

78
00:03:29,317 --> 00:03:30,582
Kor...

79
00:03:30,654 --> 00:03:31,988
more revered

80
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:35,125
than Sabak's armor,
and more coveted

81
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:39,476
than the Emperor's crown.

82
00:03:39,514 --> 00:03:41,885
The Sword of Kahless.

83
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,619
Ah...

84
00:03:43,727 --> 00:03:46,462
You told me not to tell anybody.

85
00:03:46,502 --> 00:03:48,166
He guessed.

86
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:51,307
I know where the Sword rests.

87
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:56,388
Think of the glory, the honor
of finding the <i>bat'leth</i>

88
00:03:56,432 --> 00:03:58,631
of the first warrior king.

89
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,540
Lost for a millennium.

90
00:04:00,577 --> 00:04:06,893
Its return
would change Klingon history.

91
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,594
If you know where it is

92
00:04:08,634 --> 00:04:10,731
we must bring it back
to the Emperor.

93
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:13,214
"We"?

94
00:04:13,248 --> 00:04:16,588
It would be an honor
to accompany you

95
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,529
if you will have me.

96
00:04:18,564 --> 00:04:20,468
We could use another strong arm.

97
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:22,202
And a stout heart.

98
00:04:22,242 --> 00:04:25,115
Besides, it will annoy Gowron.

99
00:04:30,065 --> 00:04:32,698
To return the Sword
to our people.

100
00:04:32,807 --> 00:04:36,010
I would give my life
for that chance.

101
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,390
Children will sing our names
for a thousand years.

102
00:04:39,427 --> 00:04:43,235
They'll erect statues of us
in the hall of heroes.

103
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:46,736
Before you decide
on a pose for that statue

104
00:04:46,815 --> 00:04:48,912
we need to find the Sword.

105
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:52,125
What makes you so sure
you know where it is?

106
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:54,604
This.

107
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:57,102
Now, you see?

108
00:04:57,146 --> 00:04:58,480
See what?

109
00:04:58,517 --> 00:05:00,546
The imprint on the cloth.

110
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,494
Yes, yes...

111
00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:04,467
this held the Sword of Kahless.

112
00:05:04,502 --> 00:05:05,471
Don't be so sure.

113
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:06,667
You could carpet this station

114
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,543
with all the "authentic"
Shrouds of the Sword

115
00:05:08,581 --> 00:05:09,915
that people have tried
to peddle.

116
00:05:09,952 --> 00:05:11,924
No one tried to peddle this.

117
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,326
It was given to me.

118
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:14,489
By whom?

119
00:05:14,532 --> 00:05:16,527
I'll tell you everything later.

120
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:20,014
Now I need you
to confirm its authenticity.

121
00:05:20,049 --> 00:05:22,648
I'll look it over in the lab
first thing in the morning.

122
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,024
Why not right now?

123
00:05:24,061 --> 00:05:27,161
Right now, my head
is swimming in bloodwine

124
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:30,042
and I'm going to bed
and so should you.

125
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,379
Oh, absolutely.

126
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,585
As soon as I finish
what's left in my cup.

127
00:05:36,397 --> 00:05:38,266
<i>Maj ram,</i> blood brother.

128
00:05:38,303 --> 00:05:39,864
<i>Maj ram.</i>

129
00:05:44,455 --> 00:05:46,985
Imagine the look
on Gowron's face

130
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:50,129
when we present the Sword
to the Emperor.

131
00:06:03,378 --> 00:06:04,939
Kor...

132
00:06:18,657 --> 00:06:21,723
Open your mind.

133
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:29,250
Oh, what?

134
00:08:34,911 --> 00:08:36,347
Hmm?

135
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,286
Couldn't find the bed?

136
00:08:40,093 --> 00:08:45,040
Damn that Ferengi
and his replicated bloodwine.

137
00:08:45,074 --> 00:08:49,041
Worf looked a little bleary-eyed
in Ops this morning.

138
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,748
How late did you keep him up?

139
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:54,792
Until that toad-faced Ferengi
threw us out of his bar.

140
00:08:54,837 --> 00:08:57,174
And then where did you go?

141
00:08:59,283 --> 00:09:02,726
Worf's quarters, I-I think.

142
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,789
Oh, that's right.

143
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,272
He had
a bottle of Yridian brandy

144
00:09:07,307 --> 00:09:10,042
he was saving
for a special occasion.

145
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,987
Like meeting you.

146
00:09:12,022 --> 00:09:15,556
Well, he was honored
to join our quest.

147
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:18,733
That is,
if there's going to be a quest.

148
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:20,245
What did you find?

149
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:24,485
I found both Klingon
and Hur'q DNA on the cloth

150
00:09:24,526 --> 00:09:26,897
and traces of metallic compounds

151
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:30,877
that could only have been left
by a Klingon <i>bat'leth.</i>

152
00:09:30,912 --> 00:09:33,613
A <i>bat'leth...</i>

153
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:35,784
1400 years old.

154
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:39,029
The time of Kahless!

155
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,874
Ah! I never doubted it.

156
00:09:41,912 --> 00:09:43,507
Oh, when do we leave?

157
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:47,392
After I talk to Captain Sisko

158
00:09:47,428 --> 00:09:51,030
and after you answer
a few questions.

159
00:09:51,072 --> 00:09:53,705
Now where did you get this?

160
00:09:56,489 --> 00:09:58,518
The Gamma Quadrant?

161
00:09:58,561 --> 00:10:00,830
A Vulcan geological survey team

162
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:03,205
was mining bakrinium
on an uncharted planet

163
00:10:03,308 --> 00:10:06,648
when they accidentally
unearthed some ancient ruins.

164
00:10:06,685 --> 00:10:09,158
They brought back
several artifacts to study

165
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:10,629
including the cloth.

166
00:10:10,664 --> 00:10:12,898
Kor was the Klingon
ambassador to Vulcan.

167
00:10:12,937 --> 00:10:15,810
When he saw the cloth,
Kor recognized the markings

168
00:10:15,846 --> 00:10:18,011
and got them to give it
to him as a gift.

169
00:10:18,053 --> 00:10:21,256
They didn't realize it,
but the markings were Hur'q.

170
00:10:21,296 --> 00:10:23,792
Hur'q...

171
00:10:23,837 --> 00:10:27,872
that's the Klingon word
for outsiders, isn't it?

172
00:10:27,915 --> 00:10:29,579
Yes. The Hur'q
invaded our homeworld

173
00:10:29,621 --> 00:10:31,057
over 1,000 years ago.

174
00:10:31,092 --> 00:10:33,896
Whatever they could not pillage,
they destroyed.

175
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,426
They took the Sword

176
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:38,537
and my people have been
searching for it ever since.

177
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:42,115
It is said its return
will bring back

178
00:10:42,158 --> 00:10:44,825
a new era of glory
for the Klingon Empire.

179
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:47,169
With the Sword,
the Emperor will be able

180
00:10:47,207 --> 00:10:48,802
to unite my people once again.

181
00:10:48,845 --> 00:10:50,440
And if two Starfleet officers

182
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,318
were involved
in recovering the Sword

183
00:10:52,355 --> 00:10:54,087
that might go a long way

184
00:10:54,128 --> 00:10:56,601
toward patching things up
between the Klingons and us.

185
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:58,230
That is my hope as well,
Captain.

186
00:10:58,273 --> 00:11:00,268
What about you, old man?

187
00:11:00,313 --> 00:11:02,616
You want to go along
for the adventure.

188
00:11:02,653 --> 00:11:04,317
Hard to pass up a good quest.

189
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:06,661
I suppose
you'll want a runabout.

190
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:11,145
The, uh, <i>Rio Grande</i>
is available.

191
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:14,086
Try to bring it back
in one piece.

192
00:11:14,121 --> 00:11:15,819
We'll do our best.

193
00:11:17,263 --> 00:11:19,497
Benjamin, thanks.

194
00:11:42,037 --> 00:11:44,306
Mr. Worf, lay in a course
for the wormhole.

195
00:11:45,648 --> 00:11:47,084
Course laid in.

196
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:48,145
Ahead half...

197
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,318
Wait.

198
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:53,428
Let this moment be remembered.

199
00:11:53,472 --> 00:11:56,379
For on this day, we three

200
00:11:56,414 --> 00:11:59,389
Kor, <i>Dahar</i> Master
of the Klingons

201
00:11:59,423 --> 00:12:02,124
Jadzia Dax, a joined Trill

202
00:12:02,164 --> 00:12:04,763
of seven lives,
and Worf, son of Mogh

203
00:12:04,806 --> 00:12:07,302
and thorn in Gowron's side...

204
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:16,973
together stepped forth
into the eye of destiny.

205
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:18,309
Now?

206
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,055
Now.

207
00:12:23,093 --> 00:12:25,464
Ahead half thrusters.

208
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:38,770
Glorious.

209
00:12:46,229 --> 00:12:47,824
Hey.

210
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,395
Forgive me, Commander.

211
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:51,240
It's a little crowded in here.

212
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:54,378
I would have used the aft
quarters for my exercise

213
00:12:54,421 --> 00:12:56,359
but the <i>Dahar</i> Master is resting.

214
00:12:56,394 --> 00:12:59,802
I know, I heard him snoring
through the bulkhead.

215
00:13:05,053 --> 00:13:06,648
Commander.

216
00:13:06,691 --> 00:13:10,156
I wish to thank you
for introducing me to Kor.

217
00:13:10,201 --> 00:13:12,002
It is an honor to be here.

218
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,772
And I'm glad he invited you

219
00:13:13,812 --> 00:13:16,946
even if it does make things
a little crowded.

220
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:28,918
Oh, I slept
like an Alvanian cave sloth.

221
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:34,133
Oh, but I had
the most magnificent dream.

222
00:13:34,173 --> 00:13:37,809
I dreamt the three of us
were in the Hall of Heroes

223
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,620
presenting the <i>bat'leth</i>
to the Emperor.

224
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:44,569
We stood near the statues
of Kang and Koloth

225
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:48,776
and as the crowd
sang out our names...

226
00:13:48,817 --> 00:13:53,126
the most
astonishing thing happened.

227
00:13:53,163 --> 00:13:56,503
Their statues came to life.

228
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,815
Kang and Koloth were
flesh and blood again

229
00:14:00,853 --> 00:14:04,922
and we held the Sword high!

230
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:13,651
Kang, Koloth and Kor...

231
00:14:13,691 --> 00:14:16,791
together again.

232
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,129
We have assumed
a standard orbit.

233
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:30,299
I'm reading a series

234
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:32,142
of interconnected
structures and tunnels

235
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,414
several kilometers
beneath the surface.

236
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:37,485
And that is all that remains
of the Hur'q

237
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:41,029
the great plunderers
of the galaxy.

238
00:14:41,074 --> 00:14:44,140
And now it is time for us
to reclaim what is ours.

239
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,486
Assuming we can find
where to look.

240
00:14:46,523 --> 00:14:48,324
It's a big planet.

241
00:14:48,362 --> 00:14:51,132
The Vulcan survey team
was meticulous.

242
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,445
They mapped the entire area
during their mining operation.

243
00:14:55,483 --> 00:14:58,356
Now, the Sword should be
in the chamber

244
00:14:58,392 --> 00:15:01,231
that once was the Central Museum

245
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:05,940
along with all the other great
treasures looted by the Hur'q.

246
00:15:05,981 --> 00:15:08,956
It's the structure
furthest north.

247
00:15:10,996 --> 00:15:13,093
There is a force field
around that chamber.

248
00:15:13,136 --> 00:15:16,305
The Vulcans told me
they couldn't get through it.

249
00:15:16,345 --> 00:15:18,317
We'll be the first inside.

250
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:21,224
Why didn't you mention
this force field before?

251
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,662
Oh, it's not important.

252
00:15:22,698 --> 00:15:24,293
I'll know you'll get past it.

253
00:15:31,892 --> 00:15:34,890
We should be just outside
the force field.

254
00:15:46,937 --> 00:15:48,738
The main chamber
must be back there.

255
00:15:48,776 --> 00:15:49,938
Let's get to work.

256
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,917
First we need to modulate
the field destabilizers

257
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:57,000
to create
an interference pattern.

258
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:00,936
It's not working.

259
00:16:01,046 --> 00:16:02,676
Try reversing the polarity.

260
00:16:06,229 --> 00:16:07,323
That helped.

261
00:16:07,365 --> 00:16:09,360
Now, if we can just
increase the amplitude

262
00:16:09,404 --> 00:16:11,877
of the interference field.

263
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:18,394
Well done, my friends.

264
00:16:20,003 --> 00:16:21,405
The air.

265
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,936
Foul, isn't it?

266
00:16:24,015 --> 00:16:26,545
This place has been undisturbed

267
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:28,059
for hundreds of years.

268
00:16:28,093 --> 00:16:29,723
Come!

269
00:16:47,552 --> 00:16:49,547
It's been ransacked.

270
00:16:51,062 --> 00:16:53,627
The Vulcans may not
have gotten in here

271
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,939
but someone did.

272
00:17:03,433 --> 00:17:05,929
Whoever did this
has taken everything.

273
00:17:05,974 --> 00:17:08,413
I'm sorry, Kor.

274
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:12,350
Don't be sorry for me.

275
00:17:12,393 --> 00:17:15,026
Be sorry for the Empire.

276
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,038
If we could find out
who did this

277
00:17:17,107 --> 00:17:19,272
we might be able
to track them down.

278
00:17:19,313 --> 00:17:20,783
For all we know

279
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:23,451
the Sword is halfway across
the galaxy by now.

280
00:17:23,493 --> 00:17:25,054
Sounds like a worthy quest.

281
00:17:25,098 --> 00:17:29,476
For you and Worf, perhaps,
but not for me.

282
00:17:29,511 --> 00:17:33,079
My last chance for glory
dies here.

283
00:17:33,122 --> 00:17:35,391
Commander, take a look at this.

284
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,786
The dust... it does not
reach the wall.

285
00:17:44,823 --> 00:17:47,126
Something must be repelling it.

286
00:17:47,197 --> 00:17:49,431
I'm getting a faint
electrostatic charge

287
00:17:49,471 --> 00:17:50,565
along this section.

288
00:17:50,607 --> 00:17:53,741
Another force field?

289
00:17:53,783 --> 00:17:56,781
Masked by
a holographic projection.

290
00:17:56,825 --> 00:18:00,599
Are you saying there may be
another chamber behind it?

291
00:18:00,637 --> 00:18:03,338
If there is, I don't know
how we can get into it.

292
00:18:03,378 --> 00:18:06,217
This shield has completely
different harmonics

293
00:18:06,254 --> 00:18:07,952
than the one in the entrance.

294
00:18:07,993 --> 00:18:10,660
This... this is a sensor
focused on the area

295
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:12,935
directly in front
of the force field.

296
00:18:12,975 --> 00:18:15,140
It must be keyed
to read life signs.

297
00:18:15,214 --> 00:18:17,243
Why?

298
00:18:17,287 --> 00:18:19,452
So only the Hur'q can enter?

299
00:18:19,494 --> 00:18:22,367
If you're right, we're going
to need a Hur'q tour guide

300
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:23,770
to get us through.

301
00:18:23,806 --> 00:18:26,838
We may be able to fool
the sensor into thinking

302
00:18:26,882 --> 00:18:28,614
that we are Hur'q.

303
00:18:28,655 --> 00:18:32,998
We can reconfigure the tricorder
to emit Hur'q life signs.

304
00:18:33,035 --> 00:18:34,505
Exactly.

305
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:37,947
I still have the DNA readings
we got from the cloth.

306
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,619
I feel like a Hur'q already.

307
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,282
I cannot believe it.

308
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,929
For a thousand years

309
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:11,175
our people have dreamed
of this moment.

310
00:19:11,215 --> 00:19:14,247
The age, the composition,
the design...

311
00:19:14,358 --> 00:19:15,953
everything's right.

312
00:19:15,996 --> 00:19:17,432
How can you doubt it?

313
00:19:17,467 --> 00:19:18,801
Look at it!

314
00:19:18,838 --> 00:19:21,003
It's more beautiful
than I imagined.

315
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,419
You should be
the first to hold it.

316
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:39,797
How does it feel?

317
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:41,532
Good.

318
00:19:41,572 --> 00:19:45,881
Very, very good.

319
00:19:48,293 --> 00:19:54,335
To think, Kahless himself
once held this <i>bat'leth.</i>

320
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:04,873
With this he slew Molor

321
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:06,904
conquered the <i>Fek'lhri</i>

322
00:20:06,949 --> 00:20:09,719
and forged the First Empire.

323
00:20:09,757 --> 00:20:14,499
And now, I hold it in my hands.

324
00:20:20,189 --> 00:20:21,750
We should go.

325
00:20:21,793 --> 00:20:25,167
The field destabilizers
won't hold for long.

326
00:20:27,957 --> 00:20:30,191
Stop where you are!

327
00:20:30,231 --> 00:20:34,939
Well, Kor, seems you were right.

328
00:20:34,978 --> 00:20:36,539
You did find the Sword.

329
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,350
Who are you?

330
00:20:38,389 --> 00:20:39,916
Ask your friend.

331
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,964
This is Toral
from the House of Duras.

332
00:20:45,008 --> 00:20:47,413
It is good to see you, too,
Worf.

333
00:20:48,953 --> 00:20:51,324
Seems you were too drunk
to remember me

334
00:20:51,361 --> 00:20:53,093
or the tavern on Torna IV?

335
00:20:53,132 --> 00:20:56,802
You held us all spellbound
with a tale of a Hur'q cloth

336
00:20:56,844 --> 00:21:00,218
and how it was going
to lead you to the Sword.

337
00:21:00,253 --> 00:21:03,957
I was so intrigued
that I sent my friend here

338
00:21:03,998 --> 00:21:05,902
to see what else you knew.

339
00:21:05,938 --> 00:21:07,066
What do you want?

340
00:21:07,108 --> 00:21:08,202
What we all want.

341
00:21:08,244 --> 00:21:09,544
The Sword.

342
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:11,816
The Sword is for the Emperor.

343
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:15,264
Who will be so grateful
he'll give Kor his statue

344
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:17,898
and perhaps even forgive
your dishonor?

345
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,744
I'm afraid I have different
plans for the Sword.

346
00:21:20,782 --> 00:21:23,586
You think that if you give
the Emperor the Sword

347
00:21:23,624 --> 00:21:26,896
he will restore your family's
seat on the High Council.

348
00:21:26,934 --> 00:21:29,168
I'm not giving
the Emperor anything.

349
00:21:29,207 --> 00:21:32,775
With the Sword in my hand,
I'll be leading the Empire.

350
00:21:32,818 --> 00:21:34,983
I can see from your face, Worf

351
00:21:35,025 --> 00:21:37,864
that you regret
having spared my life.

352
00:21:39,103 --> 00:21:40,835
Now give it to me.

353
00:21:40,876 --> 00:21:43,715
No.

354
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,223
Then I'm afraid
we'll have to take it.

355
00:21:47,796 --> 00:21:49,859
If he wants it...

356
00:21:49,903 --> 00:21:51,203
give it to him.

357
00:22:21,531 --> 00:22:22,796
Let's go!

358
00:22:55,265 --> 00:22:57,203
We need to stop the bleeding.

359
00:22:57,237 --> 00:22:59,072
We better get you
up to the ship.

360
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,671
Dax to <i>Rio Grande.</i>

361
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,562
That is a Klingon
jamming signal.

362
00:23:05,596 --> 00:23:06,724
Can we override it?

363
00:23:06,766 --> 00:23:08,202
Maybe from the surface.

364
00:23:08,237 --> 00:23:10,106
Kor, go make sure no
one's following us.

365
00:23:10,143 --> 00:23:14,486
Did you see the look on the face
of that Klingon that I killed?

366
00:23:14,522 --> 00:23:18,694
It was as if he understood
the honor bestowed upon him.

367
00:23:18,735 --> 00:23:21,072
The first man
in a thousand years

368
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:23,776
to be killed
by the Sword of Kahless.

369
00:23:23,817 --> 00:23:25,253
I'm sure he was very proud.

370
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,621
We should keep moving.

371
00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:28,996
Toral will find a way
past the force field.

372
00:23:36,053 --> 00:23:39,587
Why did Toral say
that you had spared his life?

373
00:23:39,631 --> 00:23:41,865
When it was discovered
that the House of Duras

374
00:23:41,904 --> 00:23:44,309
had conspired to destroy
my father's honor

375
00:23:44,378 --> 00:23:47,217
Gowron offered me Toral's life.

376
00:23:47,254 --> 00:23:49,523
Under the Right of Vengeance.

377
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,928
I declined.

378
00:23:52,569 --> 00:23:53,560
Why?

379
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:54,575
He was a boy.

380
00:23:54,609 --> 00:23:55,669
He had done nothing.

381
00:23:55,713 --> 00:23:57,047
That's beside the point.

382
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:58,519
It was a matter of honor.

383
00:23:58,554 --> 00:23:59,990
It was Worf's right to decline.

384
00:24:00,025 --> 00:24:02,396
It was a mistake.

385
00:24:04,004 --> 00:24:08,643
Perhaps what they say about you
is true.

386
00:24:08,685 --> 00:24:10,988
You've been around humans
too long.

387
00:24:11,025 --> 00:24:12,552
Kor!

388
00:24:12,596 --> 00:24:14,328
If he hadn't spared Toral's life

389
00:24:14,435 --> 00:24:16,065
we'd be on the way to Kronos.

390
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:17,474
And if you had not been drunk

391
00:24:17,511 --> 00:24:20,076
and told a tavern full of people
what you were planning

392
00:24:20,118 --> 00:24:22,819
Toral would not have followed us
here in the first place.

393
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,798
I told them nothing
of consequence.

394
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:27,808
How could I know that Toral
was going send a Lethean

395
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:29,072
to steal my thoughts?

396
00:24:29,112 --> 00:24:30,605
You should have been
more discreet.

397
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:33,351
And you should have been
more of a Klingon.

398
00:24:40,781 --> 00:24:42,513
Kor, what was that all about?

399
00:24:42,552 --> 00:24:43,543
Hmm?

400
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:46,154
Worf admires you.

401
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:48,794
You have no idea
how much it meant

402
00:24:48,838 --> 00:24:50,707
for him to be invited
on this journey.

403
00:24:50,744 --> 00:24:53,240
Tell me, Dax, how well
do you know him?

404
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:55,952
Well enough. Why?

405
00:24:55,993 --> 00:24:57,155
I'm beginning to think

406
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:59,361
I was too lenient
in my judgment of him.

407
00:24:59,403 --> 00:25:03,005
Any Klingon who denies himself
the Right of Vengeance

408
00:25:03,047 --> 00:25:04,415
is no Klingon at all.

409
00:25:04,518 --> 00:25:07,357
He dishonors the Sword
with his presence.

410
00:25:07,394 --> 00:25:09,525
I don't trust him.

411
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:15,016
I should have let him stay
on that space station

412
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,249
where he belongs.

413
00:25:30,469 --> 00:25:31,699
Worf.

414
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,827
<i>HoH!</i>

415
00:26:03,568 --> 00:26:05,506
What is it?

416
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:07,410
Lunch.

417
00:26:12,728 --> 00:26:14,096
Delicious, isn't it?

418
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:15,968
A hunt builds the appetite.

419
00:26:16,005 --> 00:26:17,270
It's disgusting.

420
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:19,976
Ah, but it'll make
a good part of the story...

421
00:26:20,017 --> 00:26:21,852
how we slew the beast?
Remember?

422
00:26:21,889 --> 00:26:24,590
It attacked us from the dark,
five meters long.

423
00:26:24,664 --> 00:26:27,263
Oh, ten at least.

424
00:26:27,305 --> 00:26:30,109
Eyes ablaze, fangs like daggers.

425
00:26:30,147 --> 00:26:32,176
Breathing great plumes of fire.

426
00:26:36,867 --> 00:26:40,834
Oh, it seems the son of Mogh
is not amused.

427
00:26:40,879 --> 00:26:44,653
A true warrior has no need
to exaggerate his feats.

428
00:26:44,691 --> 00:26:47,426
You'd better hope
that I exaggerate

429
00:26:47,466 --> 00:26:51,000
or else when they start
singing songs about this quest

430
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:54,714
and come to your verse, it will
be "and Worf came along."

431
00:27:02,511 --> 00:27:04,449
This is the Sword of Kahless.

432
00:27:04,483 --> 00:27:08,621
It is not something to shovel
food into your mouth.

433
00:27:10,468 --> 00:27:13,307
It must be treated with honor.

434
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:18,191
Hmm, hmm, hmm, look at him.

435
00:27:18,225 --> 00:27:19,957
He's like the Hur'q.

436
00:27:19,996 --> 00:27:22,595
He thinks it's a museum piece.

437
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:28,078
Why, Kahless himself used it
to skin the serpent of Xol

438
00:27:28,121 --> 00:27:30,252
to harvest his father's field

439
00:27:30,294 --> 00:27:32,995
to carve a statue
of his own beloved.

440
00:27:33,035 --> 00:27:34,596
It's a sword!

441
00:27:37,315 --> 00:27:40,119
But Worf doesn't know
what to do with it

442
00:27:40,157 --> 00:27:41,559
except bow before it

443
00:27:41,595 --> 00:27:44,764
and then hand it over
to his precious Emperor.

444
00:27:44,838 --> 00:27:48,406
And when we do, you will get
your precious statue

445
00:27:48,448 --> 00:27:51,355
and after they have sung songs
about you

446
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:54,456
and you have passed out
from too much drink

447
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,136
the Emperor will use the Sword
to unite our people.

448
00:27:58,178 --> 00:27:59,979
If Gowron allows him.

449
00:28:00,016 --> 00:28:02,751
The Emperor
is merely his puppet.

450
00:28:02,858 --> 00:28:04,625
The Emperor is no one's puppet.

451
00:28:04,664 --> 00:28:07,160
He condemned Gowron's invasion
of Cardassia.

452
00:28:07,205 --> 00:28:11,172
And the invasion went ahead
despite his objection.

453
00:28:11,217 --> 00:28:13,884
That is why the Emperor
needs the Sword.

454
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:17,527
It will allow him to unify
the Houses against Gowron.

455
00:28:17,569 --> 00:28:23,713
The Emperor is a pretender,
a clone of the original Kahless

456
00:28:23,754 --> 00:28:26,661
cooked up in a vat
by ambitious clerics.

457
00:28:26,697 --> 00:28:30,367
And if you hadn't supported him,
he'd be right back in that vat

458
00:28:30,407 --> 00:28:31,843
where he came from.

459
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:33,851
I supported him
because we need him.

460
00:28:33,918 --> 00:28:35,286
He can unite us.

461
00:28:35,322 --> 00:28:39,357
The Sword will unite us

462
00:28:39,401 --> 00:28:42,604
if it's held
by a true Klingon

463
00:28:42,644 --> 00:28:46,052
not a politician like Gowron

464
00:28:46,087 --> 00:28:50,293
or some toothless figurehead
like the Emperor.

465
00:28:50,334 --> 00:28:53,241
The Sword must rest
in the hands of someone

466
00:28:53,276 --> 00:28:56,149
who has been hardened by battle

467
00:28:56,184 --> 00:28:57,518
pure of heart

468
00:28:57,555 --> 00:28:59,185
who understands loyalty

469
00:28:59,227 --> 00:29:01,324
and honor.

470
00:29:01,367 --> 00:29:03,362
A warrior like Kang and Koloth.

471
00:29:03,406 --> 00:29:05,879
Someone like you?

472
00:29:14,138 --> 00:29:16,977
The Empire could do far worse.

473
00:29:19,856 --> 00:29:21,885
We should get moving.

474
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:24,367
Are you saying
it is your intention

475
00:29:24,403 --> 00:29:25,839
to lead the Empire?

476
00:29:25,874 --> 00:29:27,401
Ah...

477
00:29:27,445 --> 00:29:31,914
I'm saying it's my intention
to lead us to the surface.

478
00:29:50,714 --> 00:29:52,412
We have to change your bandage.

479
00:29:52,453 --> 00:29:54,687
No. We must keep moving.

480
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,128
You're hemorrhaging.

481
00:29:56,164 --> 00:29:57,759
We have to stop the bleeding.

482
00:30:04,656 --> 00:30:07,221
That cave-rat was all bones.

483
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:08,928
I need another one.

484
00:30:08,969 --> 00:30:10,804
Find a nice fat one.

485
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:12,505
We all could use
something to eat.

486
00:30:16,792 --> 00:30:20,029
He never answered my question
about his plans for the Sword.

487
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:22,064
I noticed.

488
00:30:22,108 --> 00:30:24,513
He is a hero to many.

489
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:27,388
If he brings it back
with him to Kronos

490
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:30,559
and decides to seize power,
many will follow him.

491
00:30:30,601 --> 00:30:31,901
But you wouldn't?

492
00:30:31,938 --> 00:30:33,876
He is not all I thought he was.

493
00:30:33,911 --> 00:30:35,541
Maybe not.

494
00:30:35,582 --> 00:30:36,778
Sorry.

495
00:30:36,819 --> 00:30:38,289
But I've known him a long time

496
00:30:38,323 --> 00:30:39,759
and his heart's
in the right place.

497
00:30:39,794 --> 00:30:41,424
He drinks too much.

498
00:30:41,467 --> 00:30:43,405
He exaggerates his feats.

499
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:45,844
He blames others
for his own mistakes

500
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:48,649
but he could be right
about one thing.

501
00:30:48,688 --> 00:30:52,028
The Emperor may be too weak
to stand against Gowron

502
00:30:52,065 --> 00:30:53,399
even with the Sword.

503
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:56,569
I thought you believed
in the Emperor.

504
00:30:56,612 --> 00:30:59,211
I do not know
what I believe anymore.

505
00:30:59,253 --> 00:31:01,556
All I know is when Kor
asked me to help him

506
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:05,161
find the Sword,
I knew we would succeed.

507
00:31:05,271 --> 00:31:06,866
I knew we would find it.

508
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:09,382
I can't say I felt the same way.

509
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:11,320
I had no doubt.

510
00:31:11,356 --> 00:31:15,893
I felt as if my life
was finally coming into focus.

511
00:31:15,936 --> 00:31:17,166
What do you mean?

512
00:31:17,207 --> 00:31:21,447
For as long as I can remember,
I have always been an outsider.

513
00:31:21,486 --> 00:31:23,959
I was raised by humans

514
00:31:23,993 --> 00:31:26,364
but I was too Klingon
to be one of them.

515
00:31:30,547 --> 00:31:32,074
I did not belong.

516
00:31:34,793 --> 00:31:36,263
I begged my foster parents

517
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,826
to allow me to visit
the Klingon Homeworld.

518
00:31:38,871 --> 00:31:41,401
They arranged for me to stay
with my cousin's family.

519
00:31:41,446 --> 00:31:45,892
When I first set eyes
on the Great Domes of Kronos

520
00:31:45,926 --> 00:31:48,491
I felt that I had
finally come home.

521
00:31:50,506 --> 00:31:53,675
But my own cousins wanted
nothing to do with me.

522
00:31:53,716 --> 00:31:56,155
You were too human
to be one of them.

523
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,823
I ran away into the mountains.

524
00:31:58,865 --> 00:32:02,603
I was without food or water
for three days.

525
00:32:02,643 --> 00:32:05,516
But there,
in the caves of No'Mat

526
00:32:05,551 --> 00:32:07,854
Kahless appeared to me
in a vision and told me

527
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:10,593
I would do something
no other Klingon had ever done.

528
00:32:12,004 --> 00:32:13,531
After I returned to Earth

529
00:32:13,575 --> 00:32:15,410
I pondered the meaning
of his words

530
00:32:15,447 --> 00:32:17,351
and wondered
what lay ahead for me.

531
00:32:20,697 --> 00:32:23,604
When I was old enough,
I joined Starfleet.

532
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:25,668
Something no Klingon
had ever done.

533
00:32:25,712 --> 00:32:26,942
For a time

534
00:32:26,982 --> 00:32:29,045
I thought that I
had fulfilled my destiny

535
00:32:29,088 --> 00:32:33,032
but now I see Kahless had
something else in mind for me.

536
00:32:33,067 --> 00:32:35,871
Something... something greater.

537
00:32:35,909 --> 00:32:38,713
That is why I had to endure
so much pain.

538
00:32:38,751 --> 00:32:41,054
Why I was forced to choose
between the Federation

539
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:42,493
and my own people.

540
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:44,693
I was being tested.

541
00:32:44,736 --> 00:32:48,179
Prepared for some...
some greater purpose.

542
00:32:48,213 --> 00:32:49,409
Like finding the Sword.

543
00:32:49,449 --> 00:32:50,418
More than that.

544
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:52,286
When I held the Sword in my hand

545
00:32:52,325 --> 00:32:55,528
I felt the spirit of Kahless
himself had guided me to it.

546
00:32:55,567 --> 00:32:57,197
Don't you see?

547
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,733
He wants me to have it.

548
00:32:58,778 --> 00:33:01,776
He wants me to lead his people!

549
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,951
You sound like Kor.

550
00:33:03,993 --> 00:33:05,965
Kor is an old man.

551
00:33:05,999 --> 00:33:10,274
His greatest days are behind him

552
00:33:10,312 --> 00:33:11,976
and mine are still ahead.

553
00:33:12,017 --> 00:33:13,647
Then we have a bit of a problem.

554
00:33:13,688 --> 00:33:16,127
There's only one Sword,
and you both want it.

555
00:33:25,356 --> 00:33:27,294
How much further?

556
00:33:27,329 --> 00:33:31,501
The way these caves wind around,
this could take forever.

557
00:33:43,845 --> 00:33:48,348
Or longer.

558
00:33:48,392 --> 00:33:50,261
We can't get across.

559
00:33:51,701 --> 00:33:54,231
We'll go back
and find another way up.

560
00:33:54,275 --> 00:33:56,304
Wait.

561
00:33:56,349 --> 00:33:58,720
There.

562
00:34:29,381 --> 00:34:32,824
Kor, there's a ledge
right below you.

563
00:34:34,062 --> 00:34:36,661
I don't see it.

564
00:34:36,736 --> 00:34:38,605
It is less than one meter down.

565
00:34:38,642 --> 00:34:40,409
Let go and you'll land on it.

566
00:34:40,448 --> 00:34:42,682
Dax, can you see it?

567
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,290
I can't see anything.

568
00:34:48,872 --> 00:34:51,141
I can't hold you.

569
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,118
You'll have to let go!

570
00:34:53,152 --> 00:34:55,455
There is no ledge!

571
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:56,325
It is there!

572
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:57,956
Then you let go.

573
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,300
No.

574
00:34:59,337 --> 00:35:01,400
We cannot risk losing the Sword.

575
00:35:01,443 --> 00:35:02,777
Let go!

576
00:35:02,814 --> 00:35:05,481
I'll take the Sword to my grave

577
00:35:05,523 --> 00:35:07,654
before I give it to you.

578
00:35:09,835 --> 00:35:10,997
Just hold on.

579
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:13,273
We'll pull you up.

580
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,163
You call that a ledge?

581
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:46,803
It would
have been sufficient.

582
00:35:46,846 --> 00:35:48,441
For a Degebian mountain goat

583
00:35:48,484 --> 00:35:50,114
not a Klingon warrior.

584
00:35:50,156 --> 00:35:51,923
You were going to let me fall.

585
00:35:51,961 --> 00:35:53,191
You wanted me to die.

586
00:35:53,232 --> 00:35:55,705
So you can keep
the Sword for yourself.

587
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,766
And you were willing

588
00:35:56,809 --> 00:35:58,838
to take the Sword to your death
and rob our people

589
00:35:58,882 --> 00:35:59,942
of their future.

590
00:35:59,985 --> 00:36:01,215
Give it to me!

591
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,265
That's enough, both of you!

592
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,710
I will not give him the Sword.

593
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,221
Then give it to me.

594
00:36:12,256 --> 00:36:13,486
I'll carry it.

595
00:36:15,766 --> 00:36:17,795
Kor, put away your dagger.

596
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,606
Are you siding with him?

597
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:23,589
Put away your dagger,
so he can give me the <i>bat'leth.</i>

598
00:36:43,382 --> 00:36:47,417
You see? I was right.

599
00:36:47,461 --> 00:36:51,029
He's not to be trusted.

600
00:36:54,515 --> 00:36:56,453
His mind has been poisoned

601
00:36:56,488 --> 00:36:59,361
with bloodwine and age.

602
00:36:59,397 --> 00:37:00,924
He was right about one thing.

603
00:37:01,971 --> 00:37:03,373
You wanted him to fall.

604
00:37:03,409 --> 00:37:06,008
That ledge would
have never supported him

605
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,611
and you knew it.

606
00:37:08,657 --> 00:37:11,757
I did not force him
off that cliff.

607
00:37:11,801 --> 00:37:14,400
He is old and clumsy.

608
00:37:14,442 --> 00:37:16,311
If he'd have fallen

609
00:37:16,348 --> 00:37:18,513
it would have been
his own fault.

610
00:37:29,253 --> 00:37:31,122
I'm exhausted.

611
00:37:37,711 --> 00:37:39,649
Commander...

612
00:37:45,301 --> 00:37:47,638
we can rest in here
for a few hours.

613
00:37:47,674 --> 00:37:48,974
I'm so tired

614
00:37:49,012 --> 00:37:51,246
I think I might
be able to sleep.

615
00:37:51,286 --> 00:37:53,417
I will take the first watch.

616
00:37:53,459 --> 00:37:56,366
How generous of you.

617
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:59,707
And we'll just curl up
like trusting children

618
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:02,479
under your vigilant gaze.

619
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:04,320
Sleep or do not sleep.

620
00:38:04,358 --> 00:38:06,455
It makes no difference to me.

621
00:38:06,498 --> 00:38:08,697
You're wounded.
I should take the first watch.

622
00:38:08,737 --> 00:38:11,267
You get some rest.

623
00:38:11,311 --> 00:38:15,312
You close your eyes.

624
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:18,333
I am not tired.

625
00:38:18,367 --> 00:38:20,863
Hmm...

626
00:38:36,353 --> 00:38:38,952
I understand.

627
00:38:38,995 --> 00:38:42,232
It's hard to sleep
in the presence

628
00:38:42,271 --> 00:38:44,574
of something so magnificent.

629
00:38:44,612 --> 00:38:48,488
Someone might try to steal it.

630
00:38:48,523 --> 00:38:50,826
You reveal your own intentions.

631
00:38:50,863 --> 00:38:52,093
Enough.

632
00:38:52,134 --> 00:38:56,169
I have the Sword,
and it's not going anywhere.

633
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,535
What was that?

634
00:39:07,781 --> 00:39:08,943
I heard nothing.

635
00:39:08,985 --> 00:39:10,250
A voice.

636
00:39:10,288 --> 00:39:12,157
I hear it again.

637
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:15,897
It's the spirit of Kahless.

638
00:39:15,938 --> 00:39:18,103
He's talking to you, Worf.

639
00:39:18,145 --> 00:39:21,953
He's telling you
to bide your time.

640
00:39:21,991 --> 00:39:23,723
Let them sleep

641
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:29,735
and then slit their throats
and claim your destiny.

642
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:34,192
I have had enough of your
drunken ramblings, old man.

643
00:39:34,227 --> 00:39:36,723
And I have had
enough of both of you.

644
00:39:36,768 --> 00:39:40,074
I don't care
if you sleep or not.

645
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:41,672
But I'm going to.

646
00:39:41,716 --> 00:39:43,847
So be quiet.

647
00:39:45,393 --> 00:39:47,866
Go ahead and sleep, Dax.

648
00:39:47,901 --> 00:39:50,466
I'll keep an eye on him.

649
00:40:08,082 --> 00:40:10,054
I have had enough!

650
00:40:10,088 --> 00:40:11,422
What!

651
00:40:12,428 --> 00:40:13,864
His eyes.

652
00:40:13,899 --> 00:40:17,033
He has been staring
at me for three hours.

653
00:40:17,076 --> 00:40:20,051
And what have you seen
reflected in my eyes?

654
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:22,820
Your own guilt gnawing at you.

655
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:24,055
All right.

656
00:40:24,097 --> 00:40:27,004
If you're not going
to sleep, then let's walk.

657
00:40:27,038 --> 00:40:29,773
I'm not going anywhere
with this traitorous <i>p'tak.</i>

658
00:40:29,813 --> 00:40:31,842
This ends here.

659
00:40:31,886 --> 00:40:33,116
Agreed.

660
00:40:33,157 --> 00:40:34,148
I am not going to stand here...

661
00:40:34,193 --> 00:40:35,493
You stay out of this.

662
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:37,525
This is between us.

663
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:39,130
We'll settle it in our own way.

664
00:40:42,952 --> 00:40:44,114
We've got to get out of here!

665
00:40:48,369 --> 00:40:51,208
<i>MaH Hlv DaH!</i>

666
00:40:55,156 --> 00:40:56,923
He's going
to get himself killed.

667
00:40:56,961 --> 00:40:58,363
No, no, he has the Sword.

668
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:02,943
<i>Hlv DaH!</i>

669
00:41:37,449 --> 00:41:38,475
It's mine!

670
00:41:41,762 --> 00:41:43,255
Kor!

671
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,496
Commander!

672
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:50,042
Worf!

673
00:41:51,558 --> 00:41:53,222
Stop!

674
00:42:07,706 --> 00:42:10,545
Dax, I knew in the end
you'd choose me.

675
00:42:10,581 --> 00:42:11,572
We're blood brothers.

676
00:42:11,618 --> 00:42:13,020
Be quiet!

677
00:42:21,448 --> 00:42:23,317
Now, about that jamming device

678
00:42:23,353 --> 00:42:26,157
you're using to block
our communications.

679
00:42:43,614 --> 00:42:46,714
Are you sure of this, Worf?

680
00:42:46,756 --> 00:42:48,124
Yes.

681
00:42:49,665 --> 00:42:52,469
Yes, it is the only way.

682
00:42:52,507 --> 00:42:54,411
Do we have the right?

683
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:57,786
This Sword belongs
to all Klingons.

684
00:42:57,822 --> 00:43:00,318
But are we ready for it?

685
00:43:00,363 --> 00:43:03,635
This Sword turned you and me
against each other.

686
00:43:03,674 --> 00:43:06,375
Imagine how it would
divide the Empire.

687
00:43:08,422 --> 00:43:09,983
Just let me hold it
one last time...

688
00:43:10,026 --> 00:43:12,089
The Sword is not meant for us.

689
00:43:13,537 --> 00:43:15,908
It was never
our destiny to find it.

690
00:43:15,944 --> 00:43:19,580
You're wrong.
It was our destiny to find it.

691
00:43:19,622 --> 00:43:22,357
It just wasn't our destiny...

692
00:43:24,937 --> 00:43:26,909
to keep it.

693
00:43:45,933 --> 00:43:47,563
It is done.

694
00:43:47,605 --> 00:43:49,509
Good. It's for the best.

695
00:43:49,545 --> 00:43:51,414
I hope you're right.

696
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:54,653
It could be lost
for another thousand years.

697
00:43:58,137 --> 00:44:01,237
When it is
destined to be found...

698
00:44:03,486 --> 00:44:05,321
it will be.
