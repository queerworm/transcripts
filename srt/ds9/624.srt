It's time to go.

00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:09,718
Hmm?

Hi, honey.

5
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:13,180
It's almost 7:00,
time to get ready.

00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,222
(<i> chuckles</i> )

7
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:16,099
Time to get ready for what?

8
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,100
The picnic.

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,352
(<i> sighs</i> )

10
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,061
What picnic?

11
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,730
Is that today?

12
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,022
Yes, don't you remember?

13
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:26,151
Oh, well, we better
get going then.

14
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,111
I'm going to wear
my blue jumper.

15
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,238
Oh, good idea,
sweetie.

16
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,993
I can't believe
how much she's grown

17
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:35,243
since I saw her last.

18
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,328
Mm. Look who's talking.

19
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,454
What?

20
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,622
What have you
been eating

21
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:39,790
since we've been gone?

22
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,333
Well, the usual.

23
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,377
Well, say good-bye
to the usual.

24
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,880
I'm back and you're going
to start eating right.

25
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,172
Can't it wait
till after the picnic?

26
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,215
No.

27
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,304
Mommy,

28
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,431
can you help me put this on?

29
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,850
Of course, sweetie.

30
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,518
O'BRIEN:
Where's the sunscreen?

31
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,186
I've already packed it.

32
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,443
This is where we're
going, Yoshi. See?

33
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,320
Last time we went to Golana

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,322
you were inside
Mommy's tummy.

35
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,657
Better get down
to the airlock.

36
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,409
The shuttle leaves
in 20 minutes.

37
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,037
Can we bring Chester?

38
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:20,956
I don't think that would be
a good idea, sweetie.

39
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,082
He might get lost.

40
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,124
On second thought...

41
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,920
All right, let's go.

42
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,255
Come on, Lupi.

43
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,424
No sausages?

44
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,392
I know what I'm going
to be when I grow up.

45
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:41,393
You do?

46
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:42,561
Mm-hmm.

47
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,312
I'm going to be
an exo-bologist.

48
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,940
An exo-bologist?

49
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,024
What's that?

50
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,650
Someone who
studies animals

51
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,818
from other planets.

52
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:50,945
Like Chester.

Daddy, if you send
us away again

55
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,783
can we take Chester?

56
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,576
Honey, I'm not going
to send you away again.

57
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:58,619
You're not?

58
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,703
No, I'm not.

59
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:00,871
I only did it

60
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,539
because it wasn't
safe for you

61
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,207
to be on the station.
I know.

62
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,960
We're never going
to be apart again.

64
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,211
I promise.

65
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,047
You want to see me
do some cartwheels?

66
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,172
You bet!

67
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,344
Wow!

68
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,512
Yay! Good one!

You and the kids.

Life doesn't get
any better than this.

78
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:38,784
That was a pretty
big promise

79
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,911
you made Molly
just a second ago.

80
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,203
I meant it.

81
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,664
What if the war heats up

82
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,666
and the station
isn't safe anymore?

83
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,167
I'll put in for a transfer.

84
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,670

(<i> sighs</i> )

108
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,616
It's some sort
of time portal.

109

From the chroniton
signature

110
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,954
we think it sent Molly...

111

back about 300 years
into the past.

Ah.

this place was like

00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,418
three centuries ago.

115
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:20,588
Odo contacted the Bajoran
Archaeological Institute

116
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,049
to see what he
could find out.

117
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:25,093
Well, how do we
get Molly back?

118
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,928
Well, first...

119
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,806
we have to find a way
to reactivate the portal.

120
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,350
It's been abandoned
a long time

121
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,269
and it was destabilized
when Molly fell through.

122
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,146
The problem is,
we're not sure

123
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,981
how this technology works.

124
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,817
Well, something tells me
the Chief isn't going to stop

125
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,027
until he figures it out.

00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,320
Something tells me
you're right.

127
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:48,283
Assuming you get this
back on line, what then?

128
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,993
We punch a transport
scanning beam

129
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,703
through the portal,
and then we try to lock on

130
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,496
to Molly's
DNA signature.

131
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,790
And pull her back
into the present.

I think I might

00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:10,365
According to the archaeologists
I talked to

162
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,826
the portal was built
by a civilization

163
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,786
that vanished 2000 years ago.

164
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,788
Which means...

165
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,207
if Molly survived the fall

166
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,252
she would have
found herself all alone.

You're saying that the planet
was uninhabited 300 years ago?

The first Bajoran colonists
didn't arrive

With any luck

174
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,438
the Chief will be able
to beam her out

175
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,730
a few minutes after she fell.

176
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,317
She'll hardly know

00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,263

188
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,265
we were coming
back to the station.

00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:23,771
Where's our baby?

190
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,274
Shh... shh...

191
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,276

193
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,863
We're going
to get her back.

Everything's going
to be all right.

00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,249

00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,875

200
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,961
It means Molly's

201
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,004

We're as ready as we're
ever gonna be, Chief.

207
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,779
Okay.

208
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,197
Let's do it.

It's her.

(<i> yelling</i> )

219
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,637
Well, there's no doubt about it.

220
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:19,929
The DNA sequences match.

221
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,640
This is definitely Molly.

222
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,267
My readings suggest
that she's 18 years old.

223
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,477
(<i> groaning</i> )

224
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,312
We pulled her out
10 years too late.

225
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:30,357
It's a miracle you managed
to get her back at all, Miles.

226
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,526
Maybe if you tried again

227
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:35,028
you could pull her out when
she was still a little girl.

228
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,405
If you do that,
there'll be no one to grow up

229
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,615
and become<i> this</i> Molly.

230
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,659
You'll be erasing
her existence.

231
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,701
Yes, but we'd have
<i>our</i> Molly back.

232
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,745
Miles, this is our Molly.

233
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,290
Just because we missed

234
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,042
the last ten years of her life,
doesn't give us

235
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,627
the right to take
those ten years

236
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:51,836
away from her.

237
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,130
She's been deprived

238
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,466
of human contact
for a long time.

239
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,843
It's not going to be easy
for her to reassimilate.

240
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,761
Her language skills
are rusty.

241
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,305
In fact, you two
are the best hope we have

242
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,431
of helping her recover them.

243
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,933
KEIKO:
She doesn't
remember us.

244
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,143
She was so scared

245
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,895
I doubt she even got
a good look at us.

246
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,188
It's possible
that she's blocked out

247
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,565
all memories
of her early life

248
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,525
in order to cope
with her isolation.

249
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,818
So what do we do?

250
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,778
Well, I'm going to keep her
under sedation

251
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,656
until we get back
to Deep Space Nine.

252
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:20,865
I've asked Captain Sisko

253
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,701
to create a safe
environment for her.

254
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:25,620
He's having one
of the cargo bays converted.

255
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,498
I want you two to be there
with her when she wakes up.

256
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,041
What happens then?

257
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,086
Uh, a case like this,
there are no rules.

258
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,714
We'll just have to feel our way
through the process.

259

260
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,690
Hi! We have
a little visitor.

261

Oh, come here.

262
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:01,531
And what exactly is this infant
doing in my home?

263
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,742
Well, I offered to watch him

264
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:06,369
so that the O'Briens could spend
some time with Molly.

265
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,580
I thought you said you were
going to be working tonight.

266
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,957
I was going to run
a spectral scan of the comet

267
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,917
that's passing
through the Denorios Belt

268
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,294
but if I did that

269
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,836
who'd watch you?

270
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,255
Me.

00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,549
That's all right.

00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:20,967
I-I want to stay with him.

waiting for this comet

00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,100
There'll be other comets.

278
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,686

you're not good with babies.

I raised Alexander.

That's different.

when he moved in with you.

You didn't
have to change diapers.

Babies are a handful.

nine of them.

I know-- five as a mother,
four as a father.

00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,036
Did you read
him a story?

370
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,370
I read him a story.

371
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,872
Did you sing to him?

372
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:08,332
Till my throat was raw.

373
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,668
Oh, sounds like
you tried everything.

374
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:11,961
I'll take over from here.

375
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,379
That is not necessary.

376
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,006
Worf, you're exhausted.

377
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,215
Get some sleep.

378
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,719
No.

379
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:23,472
I am a Klingon warrior
and a Starfleet officer.

380
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,642
I have piloted starships
through Dominion minefields.

381
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,770
I have stood in battle
against Kelvans twice my size.

382
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:33,191
I courted and won the heart
of the magnificent Jadzia Dax.

383
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:34,567
If I can do these things

384
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,361
I can make this child
go to sleep.

385
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,239
Talk about losing perspective.

386
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,742
Listen to yourself.

387
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,952
Why is this baby-sitting thing

388
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,954
so important all of a sudden?

389
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,457
It is not important to me.

390
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,465
It is important to you.

391
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,968
What are you talking about?

392
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,470
You are judging me on my
fitness to be a parent.

393
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,973
Don't deny it,
Jadzia.

394
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,808
I can see it
in your eyes.

395
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,477
I have proven myself to be
a worthy husband to you

396
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:11,979
but you are not convinced

397
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,356
I would be a good parent
to your children.

398
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,152
Who said anything
about having children?

399
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:20,362
Go to sleep.

400
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,782
I have work to do.

401

402
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:44,137

(<i> clears throat</i> )

406
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,559
She went to sleep
a couple of hours ago.

407
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,270
How does she keep
from falling?

408
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,563
You got me.

409
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,857
Dax said she'd
look after Yoshi

410
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,859
until your shift's over.

411
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,694
Oh, good.

412
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,156
I've fallen behind
in my repair schedule

413
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,824
the last couple of days.

414
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,081
Miles.

(<i> slight moan</i> )

416
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,468
You want the brush, Molly?

417
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,803
You can have it.

418
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,040
More and more
when I look at her

419
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,000
I can see the little
girl she used to be.

420
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,293
Has she spoken yet?

421
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:58,502
No... but I can tell

422
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,338
she understands
what we're saying.

423
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:02,048
Has she responded
to her name?

424
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,465
Oh, absolutely.

425
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,717
Look at this.

426
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,261
Interesting.

427
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,305
She drew it.
Not bad, eh?

428
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:12,058
She's anthropomorphized
the landscape.

429
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,726
Yeah, she loves to draw.

430
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,519
Oh, did I tell you?

431
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,230
She began eating
with a spoon.

432
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,689
At this rate

433
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,733
she'll be reading and
writing in a few weeks.

434
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,026
Well, just be careful

435
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:23,903
not to push her
too hard, Miles.

436
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,155
If she gets frustrated,
she might withdraw

437
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:27,614
and relapse into her
old behavior patterns.

438
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:28,741
Oh, don't worry.

439
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:29,867
I'm not going
to push her.

440
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:30,910
I don't have to.

441
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,203
She's doing fine
on her own.

I was instructing your son

00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,220
<i>Hech-doop?</i>

449
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,015
It's a Klingon exercise

450
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,226
designed to teach children
hand-eye coordination

451
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:57,519
so they will grow up
to become warriors.

452
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,646
Oh, I get it--
the rattle is like

453

the baby's first<i> bat'leth</i>

454
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:02,900
How'd he do?

455
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,819
Uh, he acquitted himself well.

456
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,863
Thanks for watching him.

Oh, Worf?

Um, you might want
to leave the rattle

(<i> Molly growling</i> )

553
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,587
O'BRIEN:
It's okay, it's okay.

554
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:16,796
KEIKO:
Sweetie, we'll come back
another day. I promise.

555
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,257
(<i> yelling</i> )

556
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,551
QUARK: I'm sorry, little lady.

557
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:22,052
(<i> Quark yells in pain</i> )

558
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,345
(<i> Quark screaming</i> )
O'BRIEN: Molly!

559
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:28,975
(<i> grunting</i> )

560
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,394

(<i> Molly grunting</i> )

563
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,199
Molly!

564
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,701
On stun.

565
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,913
KEIKO: Molly?

566
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,873
Odo to Dr. Bashir.

567
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,752
We have a medical
emergency in Quark's.

568
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,802
SISKO:
The Tarkalean she attacked

569
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,345
is recovering
in the Infirmary.

570
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,680
Dr. Bashir tells me

571
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,641
he should be on his feet
in a few days.

572
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:10,643
He's filed charges
against her--

573
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:11,977
assault with
a deadly weapon.

574
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,812
She wasn't trying
to hurt him.

575
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,564
She was just trying
to get away.

576
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,149
I tried to
tell him that

577
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:20,277
but he wasn't interested
in hearing "excuses."

578
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:21,945
As far as he's concerned

579
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,740
she's dangerous
and should be incarcerated.

580
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,533
Incarcerated?

581
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,201
I've talked
to the Federation Magistrate

582
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,328
and explained
the situation.

583
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,537
She wants Molly

584
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,498
taken to a special care center

585
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:34,833
on Dalvos Prime for evaluation.

586
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,585
They're going to keep her
there, aren't they?

587
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,966
We might be looking
at a long-term situation, yes.

588
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:46,178
But it's the best facility
of its kind.

589
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:49,222
Molly belongs
with Keiko and me.

590
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:51,767
If she's going
to make a connection

591
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:53,268
with anybody, it's
going to be with us

592
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,020
not some therapist
she doesn't even know.

593
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,564
I'm sorry, Chief.

594
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,150
I wish there was another way.

595
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,527
Captain, please.

596
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:04,029
Don't let them
take her away.

597
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:08,950
(<i> groaning</i> )

598
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,577
Her body's flooded
with adrenaline.

599
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,953
I'm not sure how long
she can tolerate

600
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,205
being confined
like this.

601
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:14,707
It might send her
into shock.

602
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:16,583
We have to find a way
to calm her down.

603
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,502
(<i> groaning continues</i> )

604
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,421
Molly.

605
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:27,344
Molly.

606
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:29,262
(<i> grunts</i> )

607
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,681
Daddy.

608
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:31,931
Molly, don't!

609
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:36,102
(<i> growling</i> )

610
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,229
No!

611
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,439
Miles!

612
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,858
Turn it off,
damn it!

613
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,696
(<i> yelling</i> )

614
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:47,364
Molly, Molly.

615
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:48,824
Molly.

616
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,410
(<i> sighs</i> )

617
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,119
What are we going to do?

618
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,706
It won't do any good
to keep sedating her like this.

619
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:57,040
The bottom line is

620
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,667
she needs open spaces
and plenty of it.

621
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,544
Is she going to get that
at a special care center?

622
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:02,629
I'll talk to the Captain
about putting her back

623
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,881
in a holosuite
for the time being.

624
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:05,090
Well, what happens

625
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,508
when they put her
on a transport, huh?

626
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:07,593
What happens then?

627
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,731
Oh, what a day.

628
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:23,275
I can't wait to get
out of my uniform.

629
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:24,818
Where's Kirayoshi?

630
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:26,945
I thought you were going
to watch him this afternoon.

631
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,321
Worf, what's wrong?

632
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,948
BASHIR:
Kirayoshi took
a little fall.

633
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,324
Is he all right?

634
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,201
Oh, yes, just a small
bump on the forehead.

635
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,703
Happens all the time,
children his age.

636
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:36,580
A little sleep, he'll
be as right as rain.

637
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,997
Thanks.

638
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,917
Well, I've got to get
back to the Infirmary.

639
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,674
You want to tell me
what happened?

640
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,093
We were playing.

641
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:53,806
I was pretending to be
a grint hound and chased him.

642
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:55,557
He was laughing so hard

643
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:58,769
he did not look to see
where he was going and...

644
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:01,271
fell against the edge
of the table.

645
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:02,481
It was an accident.

646
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,691
It could have
happened to anyone.

647
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,443
I was too rough
with him.

648
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:07,986
I was careless.

649
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:12,616
You were right to question
my fitness as a father.

650
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:15,160
Worf, I never questioned
your fitness as a father.

651
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,662
Don't put words
into my mouth.

652
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:19,581
I failed Alexander,
I failed Kirayoshi...

653
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:23,084
and I would have failed
our children as well.

654
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:25,629
Where are you going?

655
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:27,965
I should not be here
when he wakes up.

656
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:29,925
Worf...
Jadzia,

657
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:33,428
I am sorry I failed
to prove myself to you.

658
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,605
We've got
to do something.

659
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,607
We can't let them
take her away.

660
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:46,900
We don't have any choice.

661
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,902
We just have to hope
Molly can adjust.

662
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:51,780
How can you say that?

663
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,991
How can you just give up?

664
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,496
You're planning
something.

665
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,164
What are you
talking about?

666
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:04,710
Miles, I've known
you a long time.

667
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,919
You are planning
something

668
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,796
and you want to
keep me out of it.

669
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,132
The less you know, the better.

670
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,718
Why?

671
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:14,135
Because there's going
to be consequences.

672
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,220
So we'll face them together.

673
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,304
She's<i> my</i> daughter, too.

674
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,389
Keiko, listen to me.

675
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,765
Don't argue with me.

676
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,058
I am as stubborn as you.

677
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,894
Now, what are
we going to do?

678
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,732
We're going to steal a runabout

679
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:28,608
and take Molly back to Golana.

680
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,444
But that's the first place
they'll look for her.

681
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,279
They'll find her unle...

682
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,448
unless...

683
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:40,078
we send her back through
the portal into the past?

684
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,080
Yeah.

685
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,918
Once she's through,
we can destroy it.

686
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,669
That way, no one
will ever find her.

687
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,423
But we'll never see her again.

688
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,632
(<i> sighs</i> )

689
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,551
I wish there was some other way.

690
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:55,719
(<i> sighs</i> )

691
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,599
Golana's been her home
for ten years.

692
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,726
She knows how to survive there.

693
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,102
She'll be all right.

694
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:15,113
How is she?

695
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,198
Dr. Bashir said
she'd be unconscious

696
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,491
for a few more hours.

697
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,452
We'll transfer her
to a holosuite

698
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,870
before she wakes up.

699
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,330
There are
no holosuites available.

700
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,667
Odo said we should move her
back to the cargo bay.

701
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,378
He didn't mention
it to me.

702
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,630
Well, check the log.

703
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,131
He said he made
a note of it.

704
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:46,895
Did you get everything?

705
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,438
It's all in here.

706
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,359
MAN:
Chief.

707
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,195
Jones to Security.

708
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,739
I found them.

709
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:08,583
They were trying
to steal

710
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,626
a runabout.

711
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:11,003
ODO:
Find out if
Deputy Pinar

712
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:12,295
has regained
consciousness.

713
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,172
I'm going to need
his statement.

714
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:24,724
Odo, please let us go.

715
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:27,310
I-If you put her back
in a holding cell

716
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,728
she'll die.

717
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:32,315
I'm disappointed in you, Chief.

718
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,776
If anyone could break a prisoner
out of a holding cell

719
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,069
and get them off the station

720
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,821
I'd have thought it
would have been you.

721
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,118
On your way.

722
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:49,374
Thank you.
Thank you.

723
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,378
ODO: Go.

724
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:12,438
KEIKO:
There's a knife
and a blanket...

725
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,399
Ah, Lupi.

726
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:17,110
Yes, that's
right, sweetie.

727
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,030
(<i> equipment powers up</i> )

728
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,614
Everything's
ready to go.

729
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:26,078
I've recalibrated
the temporal
field generator.

730
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:27,495
We should be able
to put her back

731
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,830
at the same
moment in time

732
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:29,873
when we took her out.

733
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:32,042
Molly, honey?

734
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:33,334
Can I show you
something?

735
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,556
(<i> gasps</i> )

736
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:10,496
You're going
home now, Molly.

737
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:14,542
Home... is right
through there.

738
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,586
Home?

739
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:24,803
Mommy loves you,
sweetie.

740
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:29,641
I love you, too.

741
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,566
Go on, honey.

742
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,985
Home.

743
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:45,865
Stars.

744
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:49,286
<i>Your</i> home.

745
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:52,247
That's right.

746
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,166
When you look up
at the stars

747
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:55,792
that's where
we'll be...

748
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:57,252
watching you.

749
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,012
Go on, honey.

750
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:14,769
Molly... loves you.

751
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,611
(<i> sobs</i> )

752
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,863
Shh...

753
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:31,870
(<i> sniffles</i> )

754
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,330
It's okay.

755
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:52,431
(<i> child whimpering</i> )

756
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,659
Molly?

757
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:15,413
I want my mommy
and daddy.

758
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,170
There.

759
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:38,895
Mommy... Daddy-- there.

760
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,500
Molly... home.

761
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,430
BOTH:
Molly?

762
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,014
Mommy.

763
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,682
Oh, look at you!
Hey, sweetie.

764
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,101
You okay?

765
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,403
Hi.

766
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,363
You can come in.
He's gone.

767
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:32,324
I dropped him off
at the O'Briens'

768
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:33,574
a few minutes ago.

769
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,534
You should
have seen his face

770
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,454
when he saw
his sister again.

771
00:41:37,454 --> 00:41:39,705
Did you apologize
to them for me?

772
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:42,375
Yes, and they said
not to worry about it.

773
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:45,086
It isn't the first time
he's bumped his head.

774
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:48,840
They invited us
to dinner tonight

775
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,967
to thank us for watching him.

776
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:53,345
What did you tell them?

777
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:54,679
Well, I told them

778
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,265
that we had
a holosuite reservation

779
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:59,600
and that I'd check with you.

780
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,478
By the way

781
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:04,105
what does
"gung-gung-gung" mean?

782
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,316
Why do you ask?

783
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:10,153
Well, it was
the strangest thing.

784
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:13,031
I was taking Yoshi home,
and he kept shaking his rattle

785
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,866
saying, "gung-gung-gung."

786
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,201
He did?

787
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:17,327
He seemed to get

788
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:19,204
a big kick out of it.

789
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:20,913
So what does it mean?

790
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,959
That is between Yoshi and me.

791
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,962
Oh, I see.

792
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:32,591
Well, you made
a big impression on him.

793
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:35,678
Maybe you're not as bad
with children as you thought.

794
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,264
Or as<i> you</i> thought.

795
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:41,767
All right, maybe
I had my doubts

796
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:44,479
but I've<i> never</i> been happier
to be proven wrong.

797
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,274
Oh, we'd better get going
if we're going to make

798
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:49,608
that holosuite
reservation.

799
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,110
Holosuite?

800
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,611
And insult
the O'Briens?

801
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,323
Yeah, we wouldn't
want to do that.

802
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,453
He really said,
"gung-gung-gung"?

803
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:02,830
Over and over again.

804
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,465
The Captain's volunteered

805
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:14,384
to represent me
at the hearing.

806
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:17,178
If anyone can make
Starfleet understand

807
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:18,596
what you did, it's him.

808
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,014
Mommy?

809
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,558
Yes, sweetie?

810
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:23,768
The girl who found me--
can I see her again?

811
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:28,231
Not for a while, honey.

812
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:30,149
She was so nice.

813
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:33,361
According to Dax

814
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:35,113
the recalibration
didn't hold

815
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:38,699
so the portal sent her back
to the same point in time

816
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:39,784
it sent little Molly.

817
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:41,786
I wonder if she realized

818
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:44,414
that the little girl
she was looking at was herself.

819
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:46,249
I hope so.

820
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:48,960
I hope she realized
that, in a way

821
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,711
she was going home, too.

822
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,590
Look.

823
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:58,344
It's where we had the picnic.

824
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,225
Don't you like it?

825
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,352
It's beautiful.

826
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,275
Aw, sweetie,
it's lovely.

827
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:14,110
Just lovely.
