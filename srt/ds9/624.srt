1
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:08,174
Wake up.

2
00:00:08,243 --> 00:00:09,906
It's time to go.

3
00:00:09,947 --> 00:00:10,915
Hmm?

4
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:12,384
Hi, honey.

5
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:14,389
It's almost 7:00,
time to get ready.

6
00:00:15,493 --> 00:00:17,463
Time to get ready for what?

7
00:00:17,497 --> 00:00:18,362
The picnic.

8
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:21,298
What picnic?

9
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:22,968
Is that today?

10
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:24,376
Yes, don't you remember?

11
00:00:24,412 --> 00:00:27,544
Oh, well, we better
get going then.

12
00:00:27,585 --> 00:00:29,521
I'm going to wear
my blue jumper.

13
00:00:29,556 --> 00:00:31,652
Oh, good idea, sweetie.

14
00:00:33,966 --> 00:00:35,230
I can't believe
how much she's grown

15
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:36,635
since I saw her last.

16
00:00:36,672 --> 00:00:37,731
Mm. Look who's talking.

17
00:00:37,774 --> 00:00:38,833
What?

18
00:00:38,877 --> 00:00:41,110
What have you been eating
since we've been gone?

19
00:00:41,148 --> 00:00:42,640
Well, the usual.

20
00:00:42,685 --> 00:00:44,746
Well, say good-bye
to the usual.

21
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,057
I'm back and you're going
to start eating right.

22
00:00:47,095 --> 00:00:48,621
Can't it wait
till after the picnic?

23
00:00:48,665 --> 00:00:49,655
No.

24
00:00:54,478 --> 00:00:55,605
Mommy

25
00:00:55,647 --> 00:00:57,743
can you help me put this on?

26
00:00:57,785 --> 00:00:59,277
Of course, sweetie.

27
00:00:59,322 --> 00:01:00,951
Where's the sunscreen?

28
00:01:00,992 --> 00:01:02,586
I've already packed it.

29
00:01:07,273 --> 00:01:09,744
This is where we're going,
Yoshi. See?

30
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:13,777
Last time we went to Golana,
you were inside Mommy's tummy.

31
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,255
Better get down to the airlock.

32
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,759
The shuttle leaves
in 20 minutes.

33
00:01:18,164 --> 00:01:19,463
Can we bring Chester?

34
00:01:19,499 --> 00:01:22,266
I don't think that would be
a good idea, sweetie.

35
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,432
He might get lost.

36
00:01:23,475 --> 00:01:24,534
On second thought...

37
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,277
All right, let's go.

38
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,844
Come on, Lupi.

39
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:31,984
No sausages?

40
00:01:39,043 --> 00:01:41,742
I know what I'm going
to be when I grow up.

41
00:01:41,782 --> 00:01:42,750
You do?

42
00:01:42,784 --> 00:01:43,752
Mm-hmm.

43
00:01:43,786 --> 00:01:45,688
I'm going to be an exo-bologist.

44
00:01:45,724 --> 00:01:47,318
An exo-bologist?

45
00:01:47,428 --> 00:01:48,487
What's that?

46
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,093
Someone who studies animals
from other planets.

47
00:01:51,135 --> 00:01:52,330
Like Chester.

48
00:01:54,042 --> 00:01:55,636
Daddy, if you send us away again

49
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:56,738
can we take Chester?

50
00:01:56,781 --> 00:01:59,048
Honey, I'm not going
to send you away again.

51
00:01:59,087 --> 00:02:00,055
You're not?

52
00:02:00,089 --> 00:02:01,114
No, I'm not.

53
00:02:01,157 --> 00:02:02,182
I only did it

54
00:02:02,226 --> 00:02:03,957
because it wasn't safe for you

55
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,763
- to be on the station.
- I know.

56
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:07,634
We're never going
to be apart again.

57
00:02:07,672 --> 00:02:08,640
Promise?

58
00:02:08,674 --> 00:02:09,733
I promise.

59
00:02:09,777 --> 00:02:11,406
You want to see me
do some cartwheels?

60
00:02:11,447 --> 00:02:12,676
You bet!

61
00:02:16,692 --> 00:02:17,660
Wow!

62
00:02:17,694 --> 00:02:18,993
Yay! Good one!

63
00:02:20,366 --> 00:02:21,630
Whoa!

64
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,073
Ah! And what about you,
little fella, huh?

65
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:27,445
What do you say?

66
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:29,783
I couldn't have said
it better myself.

67
00:02:30,923 --> 00:02:32,688
Ah, real sunshine.

68
00:02:32,727 --> 00:02:34,026
Fresh air.

69
00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:36,535
You and the kids.

70
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:38,562
Life doesn't get
any better than this.

71
00:02:38,607 --> 00:02:40,304
That was a pretty big promise

72
00:02:40,344 --> 00:02:42,314
you made Molly
just a second ago.

73
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:43,613
I meant it.

74
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:45,052
What if the war heats up

75
00:02:45,088 --> 00:02:47,149
and the station
isn't safe anymore?

76
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:48,627
I'll put in for a transfer.

77
00:02:48,662 --> 00:02:51,133
I never want us
to be apart again.

78
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,479
Molly?!

79
00:03:00,454 --> 00:03:01,753
Molly!

80
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,050
Molly!

81
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,395
Molly!

82
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,743
Molly!

83
00:03:12,748 --> 00:03:13,716
Molly?!

84
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,720
Daddy! Help!

85
00:03:15,755 --> 00:03:16,950
Molly!

86
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,087
Daddy! Help!

87
00:03:20,131 --> 00:03:21,395
Molly, I'm coming!

88
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,063
Daddy!

89
00:03:24,107 --> 00:03:25,736
Hold on, Molly. Hold on.

90
00:03:25,777 --> 00:03:27,542
Daddy's coming. Come on.

91
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:28,708
Daddy, help.

92
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,649
Take my hand.

93
00:03:29,685 --> 00:03:32,122
Come on, just... take my hand.

94
00:05:43,586 --> 00:05:44,781
Keiko.

95
00:05:58,786 --> 00:06:01,314
Have you figured out
what this thing is yet?

96
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:06,765
It's some sort of time portal.

97
00:06:06,804 --> 00:06:08,671
From the chroniton signature

98
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:11,179
we think it sent Molly...

99
00:06:11,213 --> 00:06:13,411
back about 300 years
into the past.

100
00:06:13,452 --> 00:06:14,647
Ah.

101
00:06:14,687 --> 00:06:16,281
I wonder
what this place was like

102
00:06:16,324 --> 00:06:17,417
three centuries ago.

103
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,763
Odo contacted the Bajoran
Archaeological Institute

104
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,269
to see what he could find out.

105
00:06:22,304 --> 00:06:25,334
Well, how do we get Molly back?

106
00:06:25,378 --> 00:06:27,041
Well, first...

107
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:30,020
we have to find a way
to reactivate the portal.

108
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:31,319
It's been abandoned a long time

109
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:34,489
and it was destabilized
when Molly fell through.

110
00:06:34,531 --> 00:06:38,062
The problem is, we're not sure
how this technology works.

111
00:06:38,105 --> 00:06:40,906
Well, something tells me
the Chief isn't going to stop

112
00:06:40,946 --> 00:06:42,073
until he figures it out.

113
00:06:42,114 --> 00:06:43,743
Something tells me you're right.

114
00:06:46,257 --> 00:06:49,024
Assuming you get this
back on line, what then?

115
00:06:49,063 --> 00:06:50,532
We punch
a transport scanning beam

116
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:52,500
through the portal,
and then we try to lock on

117
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,131
to Molly's DNA signature.

118
00:06:54,174 --> 00:06:56,475
And pull her back
into the present.

119
00:06:56,512 --> 00:06:58,175
That's the idea.

120
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:04,618
Oh!

121
00:07:05,566 --> 00:07:06,534
Oh, bollocks!

122
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,303
Shh, it's all right, sweetie.

123
00:07:10,343 --> 00:07:12,507
Shh. It's all right.

124
00:07:12,547 --> 00:07:14,210
Maybe you should take
him up to the <i>Defiant.</i>

125
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:15,686
It might be too cold
in here for him.

126
00:07:15,721 --> 00:07:17,213
I'm not going anywhere.

127
00:07:17,258 --> 00:07:18,750
I'll take him.

128
00:07:18,795 --> 00:07:21,528
Yeah, come on.

129
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,434
It's going to be all right,
Yoshi.

130
00:07:23,472 --> 00:07:24,531
It's going to be all right.

131
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:26,077
You're okay, sweetie.

132
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:27,079
Come on.

133
00:07:30,487 --> 00:07:31,820
Give me a hand here.

134
00:07:35,698 --> 00:07:36,893
Okay.

135
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,925
Oh, yes, oh, yes, I know.

136
00:07:48,961 --> 00:07:49,929
Mm-hmm.

137
00:07:49,963 --> 00:07:52,024
You're very good with him.

138
00:07:52,068 --> 00:07:53,697
He knows me.

139
00:07:53,738 --> 00:07:56,608
I had him inside of me
for five months.

140
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:58,578
Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

141
00:07:58,616 --> 00:08:00,849
Oh, I know.

142
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:02,447
I think...

143
00:08:02,491 --> 00:08:05,292
I think I might want to have
one of my own someday.

144
00:08:07,502 --> 00:08:10,964
According to the archaeologists
I talked to

145
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,481
the portal was built
by a civilization

146
00:08:13,516 --> 00:08:15,452
that vanished 2000 years ago.

147
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:17,456
Which means...

148
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,825
if Molly survived the fall

149
00:08:19,862 --> 00:08:22,459
she would have found herself
all alone.

150
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:26,704
You're saying that the planet
was uninhabited 300 years ago?

151
00:08:28,815 --> 00:08:31,446
The first Bajoran colonists
didn't arrive

152
00:08:31,488 --> 00:08:33,424
till the turn of the century.

153
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,927
An eight-year-old girl

154
00:08:34,962 --> 00:08:37,627
stranded alone
on a deserted planet.

155
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:38,636
Poor Molly.

156
00:08:38,704 --> 00:08:40,105
With any luck

157
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,007
the Chief will be able
to beam her out

158
00:08:42,045 --> 00:08:43,537
a few minutes after she fell.

159
00:08:43,582 --> 00:08:46,076
She'll hardly know she was gone.

160
00:08:48,926 --> 00:08:50,087
Miles...

161
00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:51,427
I'm getting scared.

162
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:53,128
You've been at it all day.

163
00:08:54,606 --> 00:08:56,576
Just tell me you're
getting closer.

164
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,843
I think I've found
a way to modulate

165
00:08:58,881 --> 00:09:00,851
the temporal field generators.

166
00:09:00,885 --> 00:09:02,184
If it works...

167
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:04,693
Molly'll be home in a few hours.

168
00:09:11,944 --> 00:09:14,040
She's just been looking forward

169
00:09:14,081 --> 00:09:15,846
to coming out here
ever since I told her

170
00:09:15,885 --> 00:09:18,015
we were coming
back to the station.

171
00:09:23,001 --> 00:09:24,436
Where's our baby?

172
00:09:24,471 --> 00:09:26,840
Shh... shh...

173
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:28,846
Dear, come on.

174
00:09:28,881 --> 00:09:30,510
Come on.

175
00:09:30,551 --> 00:09:32,384
We're going to get her back.

176
00:09:32,422 --> 00:09:34,518
Everything's going
to be all right.

177
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:36,998
Dax to O'Brien.

178
00:09:37,032 --> 00:09:38,661
Go ahead.

179
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,300
The power converter
you asked me to reconfigure...

180
00:09:41,342 --> 00:09:42,902
it's ready to go on line.

181
00:09:42,945 --> 00:09:44,608
What? What's that mean?

182
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:47,622
It means Molly's coming home.

183
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:48,816
Come on.

184
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,647
Transporter interface link.

185
00:10:01,652 --> 00:10:03,121
Synchronized.

186
00:10:04,191 --> 00:10:06,127
DNA acquisition sensors.

187
00:10:06,163 --> 00:10:07,358
Locked in.

188
00:10:09,102 --> 00:10:11,038
We're as ready as we're
ever going to be, Chief.

189
00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:13,537
Okay.

190
00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:15,070
Let's do it.

191
00:10:22,265 --> 00:10:24,292
The field's destabilizing.

192
00:10:24,335 --> 00:10:25,303
We're losing power!

193
00:10:25,338 --> 00:10:27,399
Temporal field established.

194
00:10:27,443 --> 00:10:29,003
We've got a DNA lock.
It's her.

195
00:10:54,803 --> 00:10:56,363
Molly?

196
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,051
It's all right.

197
00:11:02,086 --> 00:11:03,054
There's nothing to be afraid...

198
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,284
Well, there's no doubt about it.

199
00:11:19,323 --> 00:11:20,758
The DNA sequences match.

200
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:22,285
This is definitely Molly.

201
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:25,303
My readings suggest
that she's 18 years old.

202
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:28,070
We pulled her out
10 years too late.

203
00:11:28,109 --> 00:11:30,876
It's a miracle you managed
to get her back at all, Miles.

204
00:11:30,915 --> 00:11:33,250
Maybe if you tried again

205
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:35,724
you could pull her out when
she was still a little girl.

206
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:38,162
If you do that,
there'll be no one to grow up

207
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,393
and become this Molly.

208
00:11:39,434 --> 00:11:41,404
You'll be erasing
her existence.

209
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,569
Yes, but we'd have
our Molly back.

210
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,603
Miles, this is our Molly.

211
00:11:45,648 --> 00:11:47,915
Just because we missed

212
00:11:47,953 --> 00:11:49,684
the last ten years of her life,
doesn't give us

213
00:11:49,724 --> 00:11:52,697
the right to take those
ten years away from her.

214
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:54,801
She's been deprived

215
00:11:54,835 --> 00:11:57,068
of human contact
for a long time.

216
00:11:57,106 --> 00:11:59,543
It's not going to be easy
for her to reassimilate.

217
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:01,480
Her language skills are rusty.

218
00:12:01,516 --> 00:12:03,042
In fact, you two
are the best hope we have

219
00:12:03,086 --> 00:12:04,076
of helping her recover them.

220
00:12:04,122 --> 00:12:06,616
She doesn't remember us.

221
00:12:06,661 --> 00:12:07,629
She was so scared

222
00:12:07,663 --> 00:12:09,326
I doubt she even got
a good look at us.

223
00:12:09,366 --> 00:12:10,733
It's possible
that she's blocked out

224
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:11,897
all memories of her early life

225
00:12:11,938 --> 00:12:14,136
in order to cope
with her isolation.

226
00:12:14,177 --> 00:12:15,578
So what do we do?

227
00:12:16,616 --> 00:12:18,518
Well, I'm going to keep her
under sedation

228
00:12:18,553 --> 00:12:20,079
until we get back
to Deep Space 9.

229
00:12:20,123 --> 00:12:21,422
I've asked Captain Sisko

230
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,453
to create a safe environment
for her.

231
00:12:23,497 --> 00:12:26,401
He's having one
of the cargo bays converted.

232
00:12:26,438 --> 00:12:29,205
I want you two to be there
with her when she wakes up.

233
00:12:29,243 --> 00:12:30,837
What happens then?

234
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,784
Uh, a case like this,
there are no rules.

235
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:36,588
We'll just have to feel our way
through the process.

236
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,846
Hi!
We have a little visitor.

237
00:12:53,885 --> 00:12:56,356
Oh, come here.

238
00:12:57,726 --> 00:13:01,724
And what exactly is this infant
doing in my home?

239
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:03,933
Well, I offered to watch him

240
00:13:03,974 --> 00:13:06,673
so that the O'Briens could spend
some time with Molly.

241
00:13:06,713 --> 00:13:08,877
I thought you said you were
going to be working tonight.

242
00:13:08,918 --> 00:13:11,151
I was going to run
a spectral scan of the comet

243
00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:13,216
that's passing
through the Denorios Belt

244
00:13:13,261 --> 00:13:16,028
but if I did that,
who'd watch you?

245
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:17,468
Me.

246
00:13:18,907 --> 00:13:19,875
That's all right.

247
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:21,276
I-I want to stay with him.

248
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:24,147
Jadzia, you have been waiting
for this comet

249
00:13:24,185 --> 00:13:26,315
to come into sensor range
for weeks.

250
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:29,319
There'll be other comets.

251
00:13:29,363 --> 00:13:30,331
Go.

252
00:13:30,365 --> 00:13:33,770
I will take care of Yoshi.

253
00:13:33,805 --> 00:13:35,206
Worf, that's very sweet

254
00:13:35,242 --> 00:13:38,545
but... let's face it,
you're not good with babies.

255
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,256
I raised Alexander.

256
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,452
That's different.

257
00:13:43,494 --> 00:13:45,430
He was four years old
when he moved in with you.

258
00:13:45,464 --> 00:13:47,331
You didn't
have to change diapers.

259
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,339
Babies are a handful.

260
00:13:49,373 --> 00:13:51,503
I should know...
I've had nine of them.

261
00:13:51,578 --> 00:13:54,745
I know... five as a mother,
four as a father.

262
00:13:54,786 --> 00:13:57,918
I can handle
a 14-month-old child.

263
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,518
I didn't say you can't...

264
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:00,528
Fine.

265
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,899
Go run your sensor scans.

266
00:14:04,573 --> 00:14:06,840
Mmm...

267
00:14:06,878 --> 00:14:08,142
Oh...

268
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:10,909
You're holding him wrong.

269
00:14:11,923 --> 00:14:13,449
Leave us.

270
00:14:15,297 --> 00:14:16,857
All right, all right.

271
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,027
I'm leaving.

272
00:14:23,515 --> 00:14:27,547
<i>AH bom-beH mish,</i>
<i>aH bom-beH mish...</i>

273
00:14:58,057 --> 00:14:59,686
Hello, Molly.

274
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,837
It's all right, Molly.

275
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:12,521
We're not going to hurt you.

276
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:19,065
Would you like
something to eat?

277
00:15:19,104 --> 00:15:20,801
I bet you're hungry.

278
00:15:25,084 --> 00:15:26,747
Golana melon.

279
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,767
Mmm...

280
00:15:35,807 --> 00:15:37,299
it's delicious.

281
00:15:46,096 --> 00:15:47,531
It's for you.

282
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:20,704
It's good, isn't it?

283
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,547
Hi, Molly.

284
00:16:30,127 --> 00:16:31,926
Remember me?

285
00:16:31,964 --> 00:16:33,365
Mommy?

286
00:16:45,226 --> 00:16:47,561
What is she doing?

287
00:16:47,598 --> 00:16:50,126
I think she's trying
to figure out who we are.

288
00:16:51,774 --> 00:16:53,870
Maybe she remembers
looking up at us

289
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,107
when she was little.

290
00:16:57,319 --> 00:16:58,412
Ma...

291
00:16:58,455 --> 00:17:00,722
That's right.

292
00:17:00,828 --> 00:17:02,422
Mommy...

293
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,898
and Daddy.

294
00:17:03,934 --> 00:17:05,904
Ma.

295
00:17:09,813 --> 00:17:11,715
Show it to her.

296
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:16,821
I brought you something.

297
00:17:24,946 --> 00:17:26,313
It's Lupi.

298
00:17:28,187 --> 00:17:31,558
She used to sleep right next to
you on your pillow every night.

299
00:17:33,265 --> 00:17:35,064
She's missed you.

300
00:17:37,073 --> 00:17:39,408
Go on, take her.

301
00:17:57,017 --> 00:17:59,956
You remember Lupi, don't you?

302
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:21,836
This is a ball, Molly.

303
00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:25,773
May I have the ball?

304
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:31,583
Would you like the ball, Molly?

305
00:18:37,673 --> 00:18:39,040
Molly?

306
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,511
Give me the ball.

307
00:18:48,831 --> 00:18:50,824
Julian said
it would take a while.

308
00:18:50,902 --> 00:18:52,599
Yeah, well, I hope
she catches on soon.

309
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,699
We're running out.

310
00:19:02,762 --> 00:19:05,997
This is a ball, Molly.

311
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:09,799
Would you like the ball?

312
00:19:09,877 --> 00:19:11,973
I'll give you the ball

313
00:19:12,015 --> 00:19:15,511
then you give me the ball, huh?

314
00:19:19,465 --> 00:19:21,298
Give me the ball, Molly.

315
00:19:23,908 --> 00:19:25,207
Molly?

316
00:19:25,245 --> 00:19:26,474
Give me the ball.

317
00:19:27,516 --> 00:19:29,076
Please?

318
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,627
Yes! That's it!

319
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:37,864
Yeah! Good girl.

320
00:19:37,939 --> 00:19:39,589
Good girl!
That's it.

321
00:19:39,722 --> 00:19:41,955
That's my girl.
That's my Molly.

322
00:19:52,116 --> 00:19:54,018
Is he all right?

323
00:19:54,054 --> 00:19:55,546
He is fine.

324
00:19:55,624 --> 00:19:57,526
He just will not go to sleep.

325
00:19:57,561 --> 00:19:58,860
Did you change him?

326
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:00,025
I changed him.

327
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:01,194
Did you feed him?

328
00:20:01,236 --> 00:20:02,261
I fed him.

329
00:20:02,305 --> 00:20:03,569
Did you read him a story?

330
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:04,837
I read him a story.

331
00:20:04,877 --> 00:20:06,244
Did you sing to him?

332
00:20:06,281 --> 00:20:08,684
Till my throat was raw.

333
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,157
Oh, sounds like
you tried everything.

334
00:20:11,192 --> 00:20:12,593
I'll take over from here.

335
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:14,062
That is not necessary.

336
00:20:14,098 --> 00:20:15,567
Worf, you're exhausted.

337
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:16,934
Get some sleep.

338
00:20:18,575 --> 00:20:20,169
No.

339
00:20:20,211 --> 00:20:23,982
I am a Klingon warrior
and a Starfleet officer.

340
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:27,117
I have piloted starships
through Dominion minefields.

341
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,099
I have stood in battle
against Kelvans twice my size.

342
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:33,732
I courted and won the heart
of the magnificent Jadzia Dax.

343
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,142
If I can do these things

344
00:20:35,177 --> 00:20:38,081
I can make this child
go to sleep.

345
00:20:38,117 --> 00:20:40,953
Talk about losing perspective.

346
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,461
Listen to yourself.

347
00:20:43,495 --> 00:20:45,397
Why is this baby-sitting thing

348
00:20:45,433 --> 00:20:47,631
so important all of a sudden?

349
00:20:48,974 --> 00:20:51,172
It is not important to me.

350
00:20:56,825 --> 00:20:59,228
It is important to you.

351
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,700
What are you talking about?

352
00:21:01,735 --> 00:21:04,366
You are judging me on my
fitness to be a parent.

353
00:21:04,408 --> 00:21:06,435
Don't deny it, Jadzia.

354
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:08,643
I can see it in your eyes.

355
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:11,316
I have proven myself to be
a worthy husband to you

356
00:21:11,357 --> 00:21:12,656
but you are not convinced

357
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:15,060
I would be a good parent
to your children.

358
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:19,237
Who said anything
about having children?

359
00:21:20,377 --> 00:21:21,436
Go to sleep.

360
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:23,746
I have work to do.

361
00:21:43,127 --> 00:21:45,063
Sorry I'm late.

362
00:21:47,102 --> 00:21:48,195
Oh, hi.

363
00:21:49,373 --> 00:21:51,434
She went to sleep
a couple of hours ago.

364
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,072
How does she keep from falling?

365
00:21:53,115 --> 00:21:55,416
You got me.

366
00:21:55,454 --> 00:21:59,759
Dax said she'd look after Yoshi
until your shift's over.

367
00:21:59,797 --> 00:22:01,528
Oh, good.

368
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:03,902
I've fallen behind
in my repair schedule

369
00:22:03,939 --> 00:22:05,636
the last couple of days.

370
00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:12,858
Miles.

371
00:22:23,281 --> 00:22:25,183
You want the brush, Molly?

372
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,654
You can have it.

373
00:22:53,047 --> 00:22:54,710
More and more when I look at her

374
00:22:54,751 --> 00:22:56,812
I can see the little
girl she used to be.

375
00:22:56,888 --> 00:22:58,083
Has she spoken yet?

376
00:22:58,125 --> 00:22:59,286
No... but I can tell

377
00:22:59,327 --> 00:23:01,160
she understands
what we're saying.

378
00:23:01,198 --> 00:23:02,861
Has she responded to her name?

379
00:23:02,901 --> 00:23:04,200
Oh, absolutely.

380
00:23:04,238 --> 00:23:05,571
Look at this.

381
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,039
Interesting.

382
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,173
She drew it.

383
00:23:09,216 --> 00:23:10,275
Not bad, eh?

384
00:23:10,318 --> 00:23:12,915
She's anthropomorphized
the landscape.

385
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,621
Yeah, she loves to draw.

386
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:16,255
Oh, did I tell you?

387
00:23:16,298 --> 00:23:17,995
She began eating with a spoon.

388
00:23:18,035 --> 00:23:19,264
At this rate

389
00:23:19,304 --> 00:23:21,605
she'll be reading and writing
in a few weeks.

390
00:23:21,643 --> 00:23:24,582
Well, just be careful
not to push her too hard, Miles.

391
00:23:24,617 --> 00:23:26,781
If she gets frustrated,
she might withdraw

392
00:23:26,821 --> 00:23:28,552
and relapse into her
old behavior patterns.

393
00:23:28,591 --> 00:23:29,559
Oh, don't worry.

394
00:23:29,593 --> 00:23:30,822
I'm not going to push her.

395
00:23:30,863 --> 00:23:31,831
I don't have to.

396
00:23:31,865 --> 00:23:32,992
She's doing fine on her own.

397
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:37,674
<i>Wa-TacH</i>

398
00:23:37,711 --> 00:23:42,210
<i>doo-GA-ya gung-gung-gung.</i>

399
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:45,558
<i>Gung-gung-gung?</i>

400
00:23:45,596 --> 00:23:48,865
I was instructing your son
in <i>hehh-duHpp.</i>

401
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,234
<i>Hehh-duHpp?</i>

402
00:23:52,277 --> 00:23:53,769
It's a Klingon exercise

403
00:23:53,814 --> 00:23:56,183
designed to teach children
hand-eye coordination

404
00:23:56,219 --> 00:23:58,554
so they will grow up
to become warriors.

405
00:23:58,591 --> 00:24:00,721
Oh, I get it...
the rattle is like

406
00:24:00,762 --> 00:24:02,789
the baby's first <i>bat'leth</i>
kind of thing?

407
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:03,823
How'd he do?

408
00:24:03,903 --> 00:24:06,739
Ah, he acquitted himself well.

409
00:24:06,775 --> 00:24:08,802
Thanks for watching him.

410
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:10,316
Oh, Worf?

411
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,149
Um, you might want
to leave the rattle

412
00:24:12,188 --> 00:24:13,521
just in case Yoshi
wants to practice

413
00:24:13,557 --> 00:24:14,752
his <i>hehh-duHpping.</i>

414
00:24:27,488 --> 00:24:30,085
Molly, come on.
Molly...

415
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,520
Molly, please.

416
00:24:32,565 --> 00:24:33,829
What's going on?

417
00:24:33,869 --> 00:24:35,702
She's been like this
for over an hour.

418
00:24:35,739 --> 00:24:36,729
Molly...

419
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:37,902
I'll try to calm her down.

420
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,036
I have to go.

421
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,574
I have to pick up Yoshi
and take him home.

422
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:42,883
Owe-muh!

423
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:45,920
Did you hear that?

424
00:24:45,961 --> 00:24:47,726
Hoe-muh.

425
00:24:47,765 --> 00:24:49,735
Molly, what are you
trying to say?

426
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,399
Ho-muh.

427
00:24:51,441 --> 00:24:52,636
- Home!
- Home.

428
00:24:53,812 --> 00:24:54,871
Mol-ly.

429
00:24:54,915 --> 00:24:56,544
That's right!
Molly!

430
00:24:56,585 --> 00:24:58,418
Molly home.

431
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:01,189
Do you want us
to take you home with us?

432
00:25:01,228 --> 00:25:02,287
Daddy, home, Molly.

433
00:25:02,331 --> 00:25:03,857
All right, we'll take you home.

434
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:04,891
Mommy, home.

435
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:06,201
Mommy and Daddy
will take you home.

436
00:25:16,228 --> 00:25:17,629
Home, Molly.

437
00:25:17,664 --> 00:25:19,897
This is home.

438
00:25:44,523 --> 00:25:46,790
Starry stars.

439
00:25:46,829 --> 00:25:48,959
They're pretty, aren't they?

440
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,905
Home?

441
00:25:54,947 --> 00:25:57,510
That's right.

442
00:25:57,552 --> 00:25:59,989
Would you like
to see your room?

443
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:47,058
Molly... Molly.

444
00:26:47,091 --> 00:26:48,320
Home!

445
00:26:54,608 --> 00:26:56,237
Home.

446
00:26:56,278 --> 00:26:57,838
No, this is your home.

447
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,475
Miles...

448
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:01,683
I know you lived
there a long time

449
00:27:01,724 --> 00:27:05,061
but this is home, too.

450
00:27:05,098 --> 00:27:06,567
Molly, home.

451
00:27:06,602 --> 00:27:08,037
I know, sweetie.

452
00:27:08,071 --> 00:27:10,201
We can't go there right now.

453
00:27:13,617 --> 00:27:15,610
Maybe we can.

454
00:27:20,632 --> 00:27:21,622
Look, Miles.

455
00:27:21,668 --> 00:27:23,467
She's so happy.

456
00:27:29,184 --> 00:27:31,314
She has no idea
it's a holosuite.

457
00:27:31,355 --> 00:27:33,222
It must be confusing to her.

458
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,253
One minute, she's
on a space station

459
00:27:35,298 --> 00:27:37,861
the next minute, she's
running around outside.

460
00:27:37,903 --> 00:27:40,067
Well, there's no reason
we can't take her here

461
00:27:40,108 --> 00:27:41,702
for an hour or two every day.

462
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:45,446
I'll talk to Quark about
scheduling some regular time.

463
00:27:49,262 --> 00:27:51,027
Mommy... Mommy.

464
00:27:51,066 --> 00:27:52,558
Daddy.

465
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,303
Whoa!

466
00:27:56,344 --> 00:27:58,041
Whoa!
That's my girl!

467
00:28:04,595 --> 00:28:05,722
I'll be right back.

468
00:28:05,764 --> 00:28:07,791
Okay.

469
00:28:07,836 --> 00:28:09,863
Look at this.

470
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,710
Sorry to interrupt,
Chief, but, uh...

471
00:28:14,751 --> 00:28:16,050
your time is up.

472
00:28:16,087 --> 00:28:18,558
These gentlemen have
a reservation.

473
00:28:18,593 --> 00:28:19,754
Well, I'll pay for their time

474
00:28:19,795 --> 00:28:21,230
if they can wait
another half hour.

475
00:28:21,265 --> 00:28:24,898
<i>Yaplosh daQ.</i>

476
00:28:26,276 --> 00:28:28,041
They seem to have
their heart set

477
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,606
on some afternoon carnage...

478
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,051
now.

479
00:28:33,258 --> 00:28:34,226
All right.

480
00:28:34,261 --> 00:28:36,425
Give me a minute.

481
00:28:37,535 --> 00:28:39,631
Let me buy you gentlemen
a drink.

482
00:28:43,548 --> 00:28:44,949
Oh, pretty Molly.

483
00:28:44,983 --> 00:28:46,042
Molly, honey, we've got to go.

484
00:28:48,325 --> 00:28:50,090
Molly.

485
00:28:53,068 --> 00:28:55,164
Computer, end program.

486
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:00,375
We'll come back tomorrow.

487
00:29:02,088 --> 00:29:03,215
Home!

488
00:29:03,257 --> 00:29:04,521
We have to go, honey.

489
00:29:13,647 --> 00:29:15,116
It's okay, it's okay.

490
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,519
Sweetie, we'll come back
another day. I promise.

491
00:29:20,395 --> 00:29:21,762
I'm sorry, little lady.

492
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,429
Molly!

493
00:29:44,515 --> 00:29:45,278
Molly!

494
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:46,809
On stun.

495
00:29:48,991 --> 00:29:50,620
Molly?

496
00:29:50,661 --> 00:29:52,722
Odo to Dr. Bashir.

497
00:29:52,766 --> 00:29:55,705
We have a medical emergency
in Quark's.

498
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:06,825
The Tarkalean she attacked
is recovering in the Infirmary.

499
00:30:06,864 --> 00:30:08,059
Dr. Bashir tells me

500
00:30:08,133 --> 00:30:09,966
he should be on his feet
in a few days.

501
00:30:10,004 --> 00:30:11,871
He's filed charges against her...

502
00:30:11,908 --> 00:30:13,434
assault with a deadly weapon.

503
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,278
She wasn't trying to hurt him.

504
00:30:15,316 --> 00:30:17,081
She was just trying
to get away.

505
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,521
I tried to tell him that

506
00:30:18,556 --> 00:30:21,586
but he wasn't interested
in hearing "excuses."

507
00:30:21,629 --> 00:30:23,189
As far as he's concerned

508
00:30:23,233 --> 00:30:26,034
she's dangerous
and should be incarcerated.

509
00:30:26,073 --> 00:30:27,975
Incarcerated?

510
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,536
I've talked
to the Federation Magistrate

511
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,605
and explained the situation.

512
00:30:30,649 --> 00:30:33,952
She wants Molly
taken to a special care center

513
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:36,223
on Dalvos Prime for evaluation.

514
00:30:36,262 --> 00:30:37,822
They're going to keep her
there, aren't they?

515
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:44,476
We might be looking
at a long-term situation, yes.

516
00:30:44,513 --> 00:30:47,714
But it's the best facility
of its kind.

517
00:30:48,923 --> 00:30:50,950
Molly belongs with Keiko and me.

518
00:30:51,963 --> 00:30:53,124
If she's going
to make a connection

519
00:30:53,165 --> 00:30:54,464
with anybody, it's
going to be with us

520
00:30:54,502 --> 00:30:56,598
not some therapist
she doesn't even know.

521
00:30:57,641 --> 00:30:59,042
I'm sorry, Chief.

522
00:30:59,078 --> 00:31:01,447
I wish there was another way.

523
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:02,885
Captain, please.

524
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,551
Don't let them take her away.

525
00:31:10,504 --> 00:31:11,939
Her body's flooded
with adrenaline.

526
00:31:11,974 --> 00:31:13,409
I'm not sure how long
she can tolerate

527
00:31:13,443 --> 00:31:14,604
being confined like this.

528
00:31:14,646 --> 00:31:16,013
It might send her into shock.

529
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:17,951
We have to find a way
to calm her down.

530
00:31:21,896 --> 00:31:22,886
Molly.

531
00:31:27,274 --> 00:31:28,743
Molly.

532
00:31:30,648 --> 00:31:32,140
Daddy.

533
00:31:32,185 --> 00:31:32,845
Molly, don't!

534
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:38,121
No!

535
00:31:39,901 --> 00:31:40,960
Miles!

536
00:31:41,003 --> 00:31:42,472
Turn it off, damn it!

537
00:31:47,184 --> 00:31:48,881
Molly, Molly.

538
00:31:48,921 --> 00:31:50,447
Molly.

539
00:31:52,964 --> 00:31:54,627
What are we going to do?

540
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:57,230
It won't do any good
to keep sedating her like this.

541
00:31:57,273 --> 00:31:58,241
The bottom line is

542
00:31:58,275 --> 00:32:00,177
she needs open spaces
and plenty of it.

543
00:32:00,212 --> 00:32:02,079
Is she going to get that
at a special care center?

544
00:32:02,117 --> 00:32:03,950
I'll talk to the Captain
about putting her back

545
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,321
in a holosuite
for the time being.

546
00:32:05,358 --> 00:32:06,326
Well, what happens

547
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,659
when they put her
on a transport, huh?

548
00:32:07,695 --> 00:32:08,685
What happens then?

549
00:32:20,557 --> 00:32:22,083
Oh, what a day.

550
00:32:22,128 --> 00:32:24,656
I can't wait to get
out of my uniform.

551
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,793
Where's Kirayoshi?

552
00:32:25,835 --> 00:32:28,466
I thought you were going
to watch him this afternoon.

553
00:32:28,508 --> 00:32:29,498
Worf, what's wrong?

554
00:32:29,544 --> 00:32:31,036
Kirayoshi took a little fall.

555
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,743
Is he all right?

556
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:34,755
Oh, yes, just a small
bump on the forehead.

557
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:36,088
Happens all the time,
children his age.

558
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:37,958
A little sleep, he'll
be as right as rain.

559
00:32:37,996 --> 00:32:39,089
Thanks.

560
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:40,964
Well, I've got to get
back to the Infirmary.

561
00:32:46,915 --> 00:32:49,148
You want to tell me
what happened?

562
00:32:49,187 --> 00:32:51,590
We were playing.

563
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:55,258
I was pretending to be
a grint hound and chased him.

564
00:32:55,301 --> 00:32:56,895
He was laughing so hard

565
00:32:56,937 --> 00:33:00,069
he did not look to see
where he was going and...

566
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:02,605
fell against the edge
of the table.

567
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:03,810
It was an accident.

568
00:33:03,853 --> 00:33:05,914
It could have
happened to anyone.

569
00:33:05,957 --> 00:33:07,927
I was too rough with him.

570
00:33:07,962 --> 00:33:09,363
I was careless.

571
00:33:10,801 --> 00:33:14,241
You were right to question
my fitness as a father.

572
00:33:14,275 --> 00:33:16,644
Worf, I never questioned
your fitness as a father.

573
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,944
Don't put words into my mouth.

574
00:33:17,984 --> 00:33:20,888
I failed Alexander,
I failed Kirayoshi...

575
00:33:20,923 --> 00:33:24,658
and I would have failed
our children as well.

576
00:33:25,734 --> 00:33:26,929
Where are you going?

577
00:33:26,969 --> 00:33:29,566
I should not be here
when he wakes up.

578
00:33:29,609 --> 00:33:30,542
Worf...

579
00:33:30,578 --> 00:33:31,568
Jadzia

580
00:33:31,613 --> 00:33:34,950
I am sorry I failed
to prove myself to you.

581
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,593
We've got to do something.

582
00:33:44,636 --> 00:33:46,503
We can't let them take her away.

583
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,735
We don't have any choice.

584
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,906
We just have to hope
Molly can adjust.

585
00:33:49,981 --> 00:33:52,851
How can you say that?

586
00:33:52,888 --> 00:33:54,984
How can you just give up?

587
00:33:58,433 --> 00:34:00,426
You're planning something.

588
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:02,202
What are you talking about?

589
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:06,114
Miles, I've known you
a long time.

590
00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:07,413
You are planning something

591
00:34:07,453 --> 00:34:08,922
and you want
to keep me out of it.

592
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,259
The less you know, the better.

593
00:34:12,297 --> 00:34:13,596
Why?

594
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,101
Because there's going
to be consequences.

595
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,331
So we'll face them together.

596
00:34:16,373 --> 00:34:17,432
She's my daughter, too.

597
00:34:17,475 --> 00:34:18,534
Keiko, listen to me.

598
00:34:18,577 --> 00:34:19,876
Don't argue with me.

599
00:34:19,913 --> 00:34:21,314
I am as stubborn as you.

600
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,047
Now, what are we going to do?

601
00:34:26,328 --> 00:34:28,025
We're going to steal a runabout

602
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:29,932
and take Molly back to Golana.

603
00:34:30,002 --> 00:34:32,599
But that's the first place
they'll look for her.

604
00:34:32,641 --> 00:34:34,440
They'll find her unle...

605
00:34:34,478 --> 00:34:36,642
unless...

606
00:34:36,683 --> 00:34:41,285
we send her back through
the portal into the past?

607
00:34:41,327 --> 00:34:43,423
Yeah.

608
00:34:43,465 --> 00:34:46,961
Once she's through,
we can destroy it.

609
00:34:47,072 --> 00:34:49,168
That way,
no one will ever find her.

610
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,651
But we'll never see her again.

611
00:34:53,988 --> 00:34:55,787
I wish there was some other way.

612
00:34:59,066 --> 00:35:01,731
Golana's been her home
for ten years.

613
00:35:01,772 --> 00:35:04,039
She knows how to survive there.

614
00:35:04,077 --> 00:35:05,478
She'll be all right.

615
00:35:14,968 --> 00:35:16,403
How is she?

616
00:35:16,438 --> 00:35:18,408
Dr. Bashir said
she'd be unconscious

617
00:35:18,442 --> 00:35:19,741
for a few more hours.

618
00:35:19,778 --> 00:35:21,805
We'll transfer her
to a holosuite

619
00:35:21,849 --> 00:35:23,148
before she wakes up.

620
00:35:23,186 --> 00:35:25,521
There are
no holosuites available.

621
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:29,089
Odo said we should move her
back to the cargo bay.

622
00:35:29,132 --> 00:35:31,535
He didn't mention it to me.

623
00:35:31,571 --> 00:35:32,766
Well, check the log.

624
00:35:32,806 --> 00:35:34,537
He said he made a note of it.

625
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:48,240
Did you get everything?

626
00:35:48,274 --> 00:35:49,800
It's all in here.

627
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,650
Chief.

628
00:35:54,689 --> 00:35:57,456
Jones to Security.

629
00:35:57,494 --> 00:35:59,054
I found them.

630
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,017
They were trying to steal
a runabout.

631
00:36:11,124 --> 00:36:14,154
Find out if Deputy Pinar
has regained consciousness.

632
00:36:14,198 --> 00:36:15,895
I'm going to need
his statement.

633
00:36:22,716 --> 00:36:26,349
Odo, please let us go.

634
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,955
I-if you put her back
in a holding cell

635
00:36:28,997 --> 00:36:30,489
she'll die.

636
00:36:30,533 --> 00:36:32,868
I'm disappointed in you, Chief.

637
00:36:34,008 --> 00:36:36,479
If anyone could break a prisoner
out of a holding cell

638
00:36:36,514 --> 00:36:37,881
and get them off the station

639
00:36:37,916 --> 00:36:39,249
I'd have thought
it would have been you.

640
00:36:43,295 --> 00:36:44,787
On your way.

641
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:51,205
Thank you.
Thank you.

642
00:36:54,219 --> 00:36:55,209
Go.

643
00:37:10,756 --> 00:37:14,059
There's a knife and a blanket...

644
00:37:14,096 --> 00:37:15,895
Ah, Lupi.

645
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:18,564
Yes, that's right, sweetie.

646
00:37:21,613 --> 00:37:23,378
Everything's ready to go.

647
00:37:24,953 --> 00:37:27,652
I've recalibrated
the temporal field generator.

648
00:37:27,692 --> 00:37:29,127
We should be able
to put her back

649
00:37:29,229 --> 00:37:31,427
at the same moment in time
when we took her out.

650
00:37:31,468 --> 00:37:33,632
Molly, honey?

651
00:37:33,672 --> 00:37:34,971
Can I show you something?

652
00:38:09,651 --> 00:38:12,122
You're going home now, Molly.

653
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:16,120
Home... is right through there.

654
00:38:16,165 --> 00:38:18,158
Home?

655
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,543
Mommy loves you, sweetie.

656
00:38:29,528 --> 00:38:31,521
I love you, too.

657
00:38:38,214 --> 00:38:40,184
Go on, honey.

658
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:41,710
Home.

659
00:38:46,231 --> 00:38:47,791
Stars.

660
00:38:47,835 --> 00:38:51,206
Your home.

661
00:38:51,242 --> 00:38:53,975
That's right.

662
00:38:54,015 --> 00:38:57,820
When you look up at the stars,
that's where we'll be...

663
00:38:57,857 --> 00:38:59,349
watching you.

664
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,942
Go on, honey.

665
00:39:13,224 --> 00:39:16,720
Molly... loves you.

666
00:39:25,651 --> 00:39:26,812
Shh...

667
00:39:33,903 --> 00:39:35,395
It's okay.

668
00:40:11,585 --> 00:40:13,715
Molly?

669
00:40:13,757 --> 00:40:17,528
I want my mommy and daddy.

670
00:40:22,677 --> 00:40:24,169
There.

671
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:40,578
Mommy... Daddy... there.

672
00:41:00,422 --> 00:41:02,985
Molly... home.

673
00:41:13,116 --> 00:41:14,983
Molly?

674
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,455
Mommy.

675
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:18,153
- Oh, look at you!
- Hey, sweetie.

676
00:41:18,194 --> 00:41:19,686
You okay?

677
00:41:28,717 --> 00:41:30,186
Hi.

678
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:31,850
You can come in.
He's gone.

679
00:41:31,891 --> 00:41:35,262
I dropped him off at the
O'Briens' a few minutes ago.

680
00:41:35,298 --> 00:41:39,239
You should have seen his face
when he saw his sister again.

681
00:41:39,274 --> 00:41:41,507
Did you apologize
to them for me?

682
00:41:41,545 --> 00:41:44,016
Yes, and they said
not to worry about it.

683
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:46,817
It isn't the first time
he's bumped his head.

684
00:41:46,857 --> 00:41:50,558
They invited us
to dinner tonight

685
00:41:50,598 --> 00:41:52,659
to thank us for watching him.

686
00:41:52,703 --> 00:41:55,072
What did you tell them?

687
00:41:55,109 --> 00:41:56,408
Well, I told them

688
00:41:56,444 --> 00:41:59,075
that we had
a holosuite reservation

689
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:01,315
and that I'd check with you.

690
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:03,325
By the way

691
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,830
what does
"gung-gung-gung" mean?

692
00:42:06,935 --> 00:42:08,062
Why do you ask?

693
00:42:08,137 --> 00:42:11,736
Well, it was
the strangest thing.

694
00:42:11,778 --> 00:42:14,808
I was taking Yoshi home,
and he kept shaking his rattle

695
00:42:14,852 --> 00:42:16,617
saying, "gung-gung-gung."

696
00:42:16,655 --> 00:42:17,919
He did?

697
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:20,955
He seemed to get
a big kick out of it.

698
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:22,696
So what does it mean?

699
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,738
That is between Yoshi and me.

700
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:29,578
Oh, I see.

701
00:42:29,618 --> 00:42:34,117
Well, you made
a big impression on him.

702
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,463
Maybe you're not as bad
with children as you thought.

703
00:42:37,501 --> 00:42:40,064
Or as you thought.

704
00:42:40,107 --> 00:42:43,478
All right, maybe
I had my doubts

705
00:42:43,515 --> 00:42:46,248
but I've never been happier
to be proven wrong.

706
00:42:48,392 --> 00:42:50,089
Oh, we'd better get going
if we're going to make

707
00:42:50,129 --> 00:42:51,496
that holosuite reservation.

708
00:42:51,532 --> 00:42:52,967
Holosuite?

709
00:42:53,002 --> 00:42:54,471
And insult the O'Briens?

710
00:42:55,474 --> 00:42:57,273
Yeah, we wouldn't
want to do that.

711
00:42:59,483 --> 00:43:02,114
He really said,
"gung-gung-gung"?

712
00:43:02,156 --> 00:43:04,627
Over and over again.

713
00:43:12,645 --> 00:43:16,107
The Captain's volunteered
to represent me at the hearing.

714
00:43:16,153 --> 00:43:18,784
If anyone can make
Starfleet understand

715
00:43:18,826 --> 00:43:20,455
what you did, it's him.

716
00:43:20,496 --> 00:43:21,795
Mommy?

717
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:23,131
Yes, sweetie?

718
00:43:23,168 --> 00:43:25,605
The girl who found me...
can I see her again?

719
00:43:27,611 --> 00:43:30,048
Not for a while, honey.

720
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:31,950
She was so nice.

721
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,092
According to Dax

722
00:43:35,128 --> 00:43:36,791
the recalibration didn't hold

723
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:40,566
so the portal sent her back
to the same point in time

724
00:43:40,607 --> 00:43:41,632
it sent little Molly.

725
00:43:41,675 --> 00:43:43,304
I wonder if she realized

726
00:43:43,346 --> 00:43:46,216
that the little girl
she was looking at was herself.

727
00:43:46,286 --> 00:43:47,915
I hope so.

728
00:43:47,956 --> 00:43:50,587
I hope she realized
that, in a way

729
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:52,599
she was going home, too.

730
00:43:54,203 --> 00:43:55,502
Look.

731
00:43:57,945 --> 00:44:00,314
