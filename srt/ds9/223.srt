1
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:04,894
Medical Log, supplemental.

2
00:00:04,934 --> 00:00:06,995
Major Kira and I
are returning home

3
00:00:07,038 --> 00:00:09,167
after opening the hospital
on New Bajor

4
00:00:09,241 --> 00:00:12,144
the first Bajoran colony
in the Gamma Quadrant.

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,341
Oh...

6
00:00:13,383 --> 00:00:14,783
could you take it for a while?

7
00:00:14,818 --> 00:00:16,013
Sure.

8
00:00:16,054 --> 00:00:17,920
Do you mind
if I listen to some music?

9
00:00:17,957 --> 00:00:19,050
Actually, I do.

10
00:00:19,092 --> 00:00:21,085
I was hoping to meditate
for a few minutes.

11
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,155
Of course.

12
00:00:22,198 --> 00:00:24,361
I didn't know you meditate.

13
00:00:24,403 --> 00:00:25,928
Every day.

14
00:00:25,972 --> 00:00:27,999
I had the opportunity
of studying meditation

15
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:29,840
with Isam Helewa
when I was at college.

16
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:31,006
A remarkable fellow.

17
00:00:31,048 --> 00:00:32,539
He sort of took
me under his wing.

18
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,610
I can't tell you how much
I learned from him.

19
00:00:34,654 --> 00:00:36,590
The man was a master
at rhythmic breathing.

20
00:00:36,624 --> 00:00:39,220
You'll have to give me
a few tips sometime.

21
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:40,422
Gladly.

22
00:00:40,464 --> 00:00:41,898
Oh, and I'd be more
than interested

23
00:00:41,934 --> 00:00:44,234
in learning any Bajoran
meditation techniques

24
00:00:44,271 --> 00:00:45,569
you might like to show me.

25
00:00:45,606 --> 00:00:50,013
We usually just like
to sit...

26
00:00:50,048 --> 00:00:52,041
quietly.

27
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,804
What are you doing?

28
00:01:08,749 --> 00:01:11,618
Bellows breath...
it's a series of quick intakes

29
00:01:11,653 --> 00:01:14,955
followed by one long intake
of air through the nose.

30
00:01:14,993 --> 00:01:15,983
Hold... release.

31
00:01:16,028 --> 00:01:17,690
Increases the energy flow.

32
00:01:17,731 --> 00:01:18,858
It's quite simple.

33
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,925
Let me show you.

34
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:22,565
How about some music?

35
00:01:22,607 --> 00:01:23,905
Ah. What's your pleasure?

36
00:01:23,942 --> 00:01:27,847
I'm afraid my musical knowledge
is limited to Bajoran composers.

37
00:01:27,883 --> 00:01:31,151
Computer, play us a little
something by Tor Jolan.

38
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:32,248
You know Tor's work?

39
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:33,782
Oh, I've made it
a point to listen

40
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,763
to Bajoran music
ever since I arrived.

41
00:01:35,798 --> 00:01:37,266
Really?

42
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,395
Tor strikes me as the best
of the lot, really.

43
00:01:39,437 --> 00:01:40,632
Well, slightly derivative

44
00:01:40,672 --> 00:01:43,438
of the great Boldaric masters
of the last century

45
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,673
but pleasantly diverting.

46
00:01:45,882 --> 00:01:47,145
Hmm, this is nice.

47
00:01:47,185 --> 00:01:50,281
I'm glad we're
finally doing this.

48
00:01:50,323 --> 00:01:51,791
What?

49
00:01:51,826 --> 00:01:53,488
Talking to one another.

50
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:55,293
Finding common interests.

51
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,628
Burying the hatchet.

52
00:01:56,668 --> 00:01:57,761
Hatchet?

53
00:01:57,803 --> 00:01:58,964
A human expression.

54
00:01:59,005 --> 00:02:00,769
It means that
we're finally putting

55
00:02:00,809 --> 00:02:02,107
past conflicts behind us.

56
00:02:02,145 --> 00:02:03,977
Making way for brand-new ones.

57
00:02:04,014 --> 00:02:05,243
Right.

58
00:02:05,317 --> 00:02:07,617
You know, Nerys...
May I call you Nerys?

59
00:02:07,654 --> 00:02:08,883
Sure.

60
00:02:08,923 --> 00:02:11,553
Even when we weren't
getting along

61
00:02:11,595 --> 00:02:13,497
I've always felt you were

62
00:02:13,532 --> 00:02:16,128
one of the most
interesting women

63
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,604
I've ever met.

64
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:20,235
I'm very serious.

65
00:02:20,277 --> 00:02:21,472
Thank you, Doctor.

66
00:02:21,513 --> 00:02:23,175
Julian.

67
00:02:23,215 --> 00:02:26,050
Go on, say it.

68
00:02:26,088 --> 00:02:29,424
- Julian.
- Julian.

69
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,124
It was hard for Chief O'Brien,
as well, at first.

70
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:34,863
We had our problems, too,
but now we're like this.

71
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,304
One minute to the wormhole.

72
00:02:36,339 --> 00:02:38,001
Stand by to drop to impulse.

73
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:40,239
Would you like
to have dinner sometime?

74
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,582
I, uh, I think you'd
better stick with Dax.

75
00:02:43,619 --> 00:02:44,587
I'm sorry?

76
00:02:44,621 --> 00:02:45,611
Oh!

77
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:48,182
You thought
that I was trying to...

78
00:02:48,227 --> 00:02:49,217
No, no...

79
00:02:49,262 --> 00:02:50,321
My, my mistake.

80
00:02:50,364 --> 00:02:51,832
But if I thought...

81
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:52,835
Forget it!

82
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:53,837
Right.

83
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:55,932
Take us out of warp.

84
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:58,643
What's wrong?

85
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,707
The warp field's
not fully collapsed.

86
00:03:00,749 --> 00:03:02,217
I'm showing
a plasma injector leak.

87
00:03:02,253 --> 00:03:03,778
Injector controllers
are locked.

88
00:03:03,822 --> 00:03:05,154
I'm trying to compensate.

89
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,902
Injectors opening,
velocity falling.

90
00:03:13,506 --> 00:03:15,134
What was that?

91
00:03:15,176 --> 00:03:17,078
Initiating emergency
stabilization control.

92
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,419
Are you all right?

93
00:03:25,461 --> 00:03:28,125
A little dizzy.

94
00:03:28,165 --> 00:03:29,326
Yeah, me, too.

95
00:03:29,368 --> 00:03:32,568
I guess we're lucky
to be in one piece.

96
00:03:41,256 --> 00:03:45,161
Oh, we'd better get
Mr. O'Brien to take a...

97
00:03:45,196 --> 00:03:46,255
What the hell?

98
00:03:46,298 --> 00:03:48,768
Where's the station?

99
00:03:48,803 --> 00:03:50,966
What happened to the station?

100
00:03:51,007 --> 00:03:53,102
I have it on long-range sensors.

101
00:03:53,144 --> 00:03:54,373
It's...

102
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,606
orbiting Bajor?

103
00:03:55,648 --> 00:03:57,378
Major...

104
00:03:57,419 --> 00:03:59,855
vessel approaching on an
intercept course, dead ahead.

105
00:04:13,748 --> 00:04:14,875
What is this?

106
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:17,149
I'm... sorry, ma'am.

107
00:04:17,188 --> 00:04:19,181
We were not informed
you'd left the station.

108
00:04:19,224 --> 00:04:20,214
Who are you?

109
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,693
We were on standard patrol

110
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:24,359
when your vessel seemed
to appear out of nowhere.

111
00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:26,163
If you will allow
us to withdraw

112
00:04:26,204 --> 00:04:28,367
we will escort you
back to the station.

113
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,929
I was as close to her
as I am to you.

114
00:04:43,969 --> 00:04:45,232
She cannot be an impostor.

115
00:04:45,271 --> 00:04:46,762
But she is.

116
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:53,119
What is going on here?

117
00:04:53,152 --> 00:04:54,279
Garak!

118
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,282
Yes, my name is Garak.

119
00:04:58,327 --> 00:05:00,057
The question is...

120
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,269
who...

121
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,273
are you?

122
00:07:04,087 --> 00:07:07,821
This... may sound
like an odd question

123
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:11,391
but... could you tell us
where we are?

124
00:07:11,434 --> 00:07:13,198
This is the Terok Nor station.

125
00:07:13,237 --> 00:07:15,969
The center of authority
for the Bajoran Sector.

126
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:18,479
"Center of authority."

127
00:07:18,514 --> 00:07:20,484
Whose authority?

128
00:07:20,517 --> 00:07:22,680
The Alliance, of course.

129
00:07:22,721 --> 00:07:24,121
Something is very wrong here.

130
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:26,320
I think we took a wrong turn
in the wormhole.

131
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:27,488
Wormhole?

132
00:07:27,596 --> 00:07:30,471
The wormhole to the Gamma...

133
00:07:30,604 --> 00:07:32,072
It's very difficult to explain.

134
00:07:32,107 --> 00:07:33,336
I think it would be best

135
00:07:33,376 --> 00:07:35,346
if we just got back
to our ship and...

136
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,814
No!

137
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:37,874
I don't think so.

138
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:39,011
Now, wait a minute.

139
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:42,184
Don't take that tone
with us, Terran.

140
00:07:42,225 --> 00:07:43,250
Terran?

141
00:07:43,294 --> 00:07:45,526
If you are
who I suspect you are

142
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:49,026
I'm afraid I can't run the risk
of letting you go.

143
00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:50,505
Take that one below.

144
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,701
Put him to work.

145
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:54,679
Tell the supervisor
to keep an eye on him.

146
00:07:54,714 --> 00:07:56,478
He won't know the rules.

147
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:10,739
Move, Terrans! Move!

148
00:08:12,212 --> 00:08:13,680
Intendant!

149
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:17,347
What is it you need, Telok?

150
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:19,221
This Terran was caught
trying to stow away

151
00:08:19,258 --> 00:08:20,283
on one of the freighters

152
00:08:20,327 --> 00:08:22,695
leaving the station.

153
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,643
What is your designation?

154
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:32,843
0413-Theta.

155
00:08:32,883 --> 00:08:33,851
Theta.

156
00:08:33,885 --> 00:08:35,615
Yes, ma'am.

157
00:08:35,655 --> 00:08:39,150
You worked so hard
to earn your theta designation

158
00:08:39,194 --> 00:08:40,526
to earn our trust.

159
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:43,090
Why do you throw
it away like this?

160
00:08:43,135 --> 00:08:44,865
Reassign him to Lambda.

161
00:08:44,905 --> 00:08:46,533
Send him to the mines.

162
00:08:46,574 --> 00:08:48,304
The mines?
But he should die for this.

163
00:08:48,344 --> 00:08:50,507
We should make
an example of him.

164
00:08:50,548 --> 00:08:54,851
You have made a career
out of setting examples, Garak.

165
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,486
I think you enjoy it too much.

166
00:08:57,528 --> 00:09:00,590
He could never have gotten
on board that ship without help.

167
00:09:00,633 --> 00:09:02,899
This is the third incident
in a month.

168
00:09:02,937 --> 00:09:05,499
At least, allow me
to interrogate him.

169
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:07,535
Fine.
Interrogate him.

170
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:11,109
But if he dies
under your interrogation

171
00:09:11,152 --> 00:09:13,520
I will make you my example.

172
00:09:13,556 --> 00:09:14,854
Is that clear?

173
00:09:14,892 --> 00:09:17,886
Very, Intendant.

174
00:09:26,146 --> 00:09:27,444
I'm telling you.

175
00:09:27,482 --> 00:09:29,645
If you don't upgrade the
thorium containment cells

176
00:09:29,685 --> 00:09:31,848
there's going to be an accident,
and I'm not going

177
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:33,619
to be responsible
for the consequences.

178
00:09:35,796 --> 00:09:37,594
Another worker for you...

179
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:39,660
a Terran who doesn't know
the rules.

180
00:09:39,703 --> 00:09:40,693
Well!

181
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,743
We'll see to it
that he learns them.

182
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:46,772
What's your designation?

183
00:09:46,816 --> 00:09:48,718
Bashir, Julian.

184
00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:50,655
Is that a joke?

185
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:52,818
I don't know.
Is it?

186
00:09:53,896 --> 00:09:55,592
No jokes.

187
00:09:55,632 --> 00:09:58,626
That's my Rule of Obedience
Number 14.

188
00:09:58,671 --> 00:10:01,437
Now, what's your designation?

189
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,106
I don't have a designation.

190
00:10:04,147 --> 00:10:07,084
I don't have a designation,
sir.

191
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:08,644
Another Rule of Obedience?

192
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:12,760
I don't have a designation

193
00:10:12,796 --> 00:10:14,823
sir...

194
00:10:14,934 --> 00:10:18,930
I don't have a designation, sir.

195
00:10:18,974 --> 00:10:20,704
Now, why is that?

196
00:10:20,743 --> 00:10:21,836
I don't know.

197
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,382
And frankly, I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

198
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:26,478
You're here to process ore.

199
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:28,957
Have you ever done that before?

200
00:10:28,992 --> 00:10:30,688
No, I haven't.

201
00:10:30,728 --> 00:10:32,857
Have you ever worked
in the mines?

202
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:33,865
No.

203
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,732
Then what have you done?

204
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,763
I've been practicing medicine.

205
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:43,511
Did you forget Rule of Obedience
Number 14?

206
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:45,383
It's not a joke.

207
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:47,014
I am a doctor.

208
00:10:47,057 --> 00:10:51,429
Well, Doctor, don't forget
to scrub before you operate.

209
00:11:20,518 --> 00:11:21,645
Oh, sit down.

210
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:29,127
You are me, aren't you?

211
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:31,228
I am Kira Nerys.

212
00:11:31,271 --> 00:11:33,137
That makes two of us.

213
00:11:33,174 --> 00:11:34,904
Where you come from

214
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:38,883
things are very much
like this, aren't they?

215
00:11:38,918 --> 00:11:42,379
There's a station,
a Bajor, Cardassians

216
00:11:42,423 --> 00:11:43,789
Terrans, Klingons.

217
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:45,797
The players are all the same

218
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,269
but... everyone seems to be
playing different parts.

219
00:11:49,303 --> 00:11:51,432
You didn't seem
to recognize the Alliance.

220
00:11:51,474 --> 00:11:52,942
No.

221
00:11:52,976 --> 00:11:56,471
Perhaps you'd recognize
the name Kirk.

222
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:59,043
No, I'm sorry, I don't.

223
00:11:59,087 --> 00:12:00,385
Interesting.

224
00:12:00,423 --> 00:12:03,657
On my side, Kirk is one
of the most famous names

225
00:12:03,695 --> 00:12:04,890
in our history.

226
00:12:08,003 --> 00:12:09,665
Almost a century ago

227
00:12:09,706 --> 00:12:14,579
a Terran starship captain
named James Kirk

228
00:12:14,615 --> 00:12:16,243
accidentally exchanged places

229
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:18,255
with his counterpart
from your side

230
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:20,154
due to a transporter accident.

231
00:12:20,192 --> 00:12:24,564
Our Terrans were
barbarians then

232
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:26,831
but their empire was strong.

233
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,238
While your Kirk
was on this side

234
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:30,834
he met a Vulcan named Spock

235
00:12:30,877 --> 00:12:33,939
and somehow had
a profound influence on him.

236
00:12:33,983 --> 00:12:36,886
Afterwards, Spock rose
to Commander in Chief

237
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:42,832
of the Empire by preaching
reforms, disarmament, peace.

238
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:48,365
It was quite a remarkable
turnabout for his people.

239
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:50,275
Unfortunately for them

240
00:12:50,313 --> 00:12:53,717
when Spock had completed
all his reforms

241
00:12:53,752 --> 00:12:57,156
his Empire was no longer
in any position

242
00:12:57,191 --> 00:12:58,989
to defend itself against us.

243
00:12:59,095 --> 00:13:00,290
Us?

244
00:13:00,331 --> 00:13:03,826
The Alliance,
the historic coming-together

245
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,865
of the Klingons
and the Cardassians.

246
00:13:06,909 --> 00:13:10,507
And Bajor is a part
of this Alliance?

247
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:13,520
We'd been under Terran
occupation for decades.

248
00:13:13,554 --> 00:13:14,715
When we were freed

249
00:13:14,756 --> 00:13:17,454
we petitioned
for entry and were accepted.

250
00:13:17,494 --> 00:13:21,661
We have become quite
an influential power

251
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:23,261
within the Alliance.

252
00:13:23,305 --> 00:13:26,471
Is it similar at all
on your side?

253
00:13:26,511 --> 00:13:27,570
No.

254
00:13:27,613 --> 00:13:30,277
My Bajor is not so fortunate.

255
00:13:30,318 --> 00:13:33,153
I'd be very interested
to hear more about it.

256
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,217
I can't stay here.

257
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,321
You must see that.

258
00:13:37,363 --> 00:13:41,462
Well, you see,
that's part of the problem.

259
00:13:41,505 --> 00:13:44,807
I don't know
how to send you back.

260
00:13:44,843 --> 00:13:47,541
But more than that...

261
00:13:48,851 --> 00:13:50,912
there's a...

262
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:55,054
a certain protocol
I'm supposed to follow.

263
00:13:56,231 --> 00:13:58,201
I'm not sure what you mean.

264
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,300
After the first crossover

265
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:05,576
we were afraid others might come
to interfere in our affairs.

266
00:14:05,615 --> 00:14:08,415
It was decided then
that if it ever happened again

267
00:14:08,453 --> 00:14:09,887
we would promptly dispose

268
00:14:09,922 --> 00:14:12,825
of anyone who appeared
from your side.

269
00:14:12,861 --> 00:14:14,458
I see.

270
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:18,086
Unlike my First Officer,
Mr. Garak

271
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:21,331
I have no taste for violence.

272
00:14:21,371 --> 00:14:26,472
I regret using it,
even when it seems necessary.

273
00:14:26,513 --> 00:14:29,541
I know exactly what you mean.

274
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:31,851
You do, don't you?

275
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:34,485
I know you don't want to kill me

276
00:14:34,527 --> 00:14:38,227
and you're searching
for a good reason not to.

277
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,706
Got any ideas?

278
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:45,302
My side needs what you have...
a strong Bajor.

279
00:14:45,347 --> 00:14:48,045
If you knew the struggles
we've been through

280
00:14:48,085 --> 00:14:49,383
to rebuild our world...

281
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:52,290
Who's to say you won't
influence us this time?

282
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:53,658
Me?

283
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,495
My side once changed
the course of your history.

284
00:14:56,534 --> 00:14:59,630
Well, maybe this time
your side can change mine.

285
00:14:59,672 --> 00:15:02,438
Maybe you can teach me
what I need to know

286
00:15:02,477 --> 00:15:05,346
to become the leader
of Bajor, as you have.

287
00:15:05,383 --> 00:15:07,147
That appeals to me.

288
00:15:07,186 --> 00:15:09,052
If I can find a way back.

289
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:12,027
But... I will have
to kill your friend.

290
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:13,029
No, don't.

291
00:15:13,063 --> 00:15:14,224
If you knew him...

292
00:15:14,265 --> 00:15:15,824
He's an arrogant Terran

293
00:15:15,868 --> 00:15:18,668
who's lived
a privileged life on my side.

294
00:15:18,706 --> 00:15:21,199
Let him see how
the other half lives.

295
00:15:21,244 --> 00:15:22,712
No, it's too dangerous.

296
00:15:22,814 --> 00:15:26,548
The Cardassians and the Klingons
would never allow it.

297
00:15:26,588 --> 00:15:31,256
Are you the leader
of this sector or not?

298
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:34,965
Oh!

299
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:37,404
You know how to manipulate me.

300
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,002
I know how I'd feel
in your place.

301
00:15:40,045 --> 00:15:41,638
I wouldn't give a damn

302
00:15:41,682 --> 00:15:45,018
what the Cardassians
or the Klingons thought.

303
00:15:45,054 --> 00:15:46,990
You're right.

304
00:15:48,493 --> 00:15:50,155
I don't.

305
00:15:56,608 --> 00:15:58,133
Find this...

306
00:15:58,178 --> 00:16:02,642
attractive young woman
some quarters.

307
00:16:06,358 --> 00:16:08,190
Kira Nerys

308
00:16:08,229 --> 00:16:10,392
I'll call for you later.

309
00:16:26,496 --> 00:16:28,466
The Intendant informed me

310
00:16:28,499 --> 00:16:30,696
you'd be inspecting
the facilities.

311
00:16:30,736 --> 00:16:33,468
If there's anything
I can explain...

312
00:16:33,508 --> 00:16:36,138
No. I've worked
in ore processing, myself.

313
00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:40,419
Is my Terran friend
behaving himself?

314
00:16:40,454 --> 00:16:44,188
They all behave themselves
when I'm in charge.

315
00:16:44,227 --> 00:16:45,889
Good.

316
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:49,026
Good. If you don't mind,
I'll speak with him.

317
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:50,594
Huh?

318
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,607
Are you all right?

319
00:16:51,641 --> 00:16:52,802
Learning a new trade.

320
00:16:52,876 --> 00:16:54,344
Do you have any idea
what happened?

321
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:55,608
Have you ever heard

322
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,743
of a Starfleet Captain
named James Kirk?

323
00:16:57,785 --> 00:16:58,946
Kirk?!

324
00:16:58,987 --> 00:17:02,153
Oh, of course...
the transporter accident.

325
00:17:02,193 --> 00:17:03,161
Read about it at the Academy.

326
00:17:03,195 --> 00:17:04,163
So, that's where we are.

327
00:17:04,197 --> 00:17:05,324
That's where we are.

328
00:17:05,365 --> 00:17:06,492
Is there another me here?

329
00:17:06,534 --> 00:17:07,502
Not on this station.

330
00:17:07,535 --> 00:17:08,867
I haven't found Dax or Sisko.

331
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:11,170
O'Brien's been tinkering around
with the machines.

332
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:12,700
Major, if Kirk got here
by transporter

333
00:17:12,745 --> 00:17:14,509
do you think we could
get back the same way?

334
00:17:14,548 --> 00:17:16,780
I don't know anything
about transporters. Do you?

335
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,447
Well, no one knows
more about transporters

336
00:17:18,488 --> 00:17:19,547
than Chief O'Brien.

337
00:17:19,591 --> 00:17:21,652
Well, our Chief O'Brien.
Who knows about theirs?

338
00:17:21,695 --> 00:17:23,288
It's worth a shot.

339
00:17:23,331 --> 00:17:24,731
Talk to him.

340
00:17:24,766 --> 00:17:25,734
I'll try to see if I can find

341
00:17:25,768 --> 00:17:27,134
anyone else who might
be willing to help.

342
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,366
Yeah.

343
00:17:42,064 --> 00:17:46,231
You certainly are the spitting
image of the Intendant...

344
00:17:46,272 --> 00:17:48,265
just as they said.

345
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:50,107
Hello, Quark.

346
00:17:50,145 --> 00:17:52,011
You know my name.

347
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:54,246
Quark runs a bar
on my side, too.

348
00:17:54,287 --> 00:17:55,312
Really?

349
00:17:55,355 --> 00:17:57,450
I hope I'm doing
decent business.

350
00:17:57,492 --> 00:17:59,256
Got to be better than here.

351
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:02,496
The Alliance taxes
are killing me.

352
00:18:02,534 --> 00:18:03,797
What can I get you?

353
00:18:03,836 --> 00:18:05,395
The Intendant likes
a hot <i>jumja</i> tea

354
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,408
this time of day.

355
00:18:06,441 --> 00:18:08,468
Well, I'm not her

356
00:18:08,512 --> 00:18:11,244
but that does sound good.

357
00:18:11,283 --> 00:18:12,512
Coming up.

358
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:20,591
So, uh, are we close friends
on your side?

359
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:23,571
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, we are.

360
00:18:23,605 --> 00:18:27,305
On my side, Quark does
me a lot of favors.

361
00:18:27,346 --> 00:18:28,837
Favors?

362
00:18:28,915 --> 00:18:30,110
The Quark I know...

363
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,846
well, he just has the ability

364
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:34,391
to get things done
when no one else can.

365
00:18:34,425 --> 00:18:35,791
You know what I mean?

366
00:18:35,828 --> 00:18:37,957
Sometimes he even
gets things done

367
00:18:37,999 --> 00:18:40,526
behind the backs
of the security people.

368
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,563
What kind of favors
do you ask him for?

369
00:18:42,606 --> 00:18:45,441
Oh, all sorts of favors, like...

370
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:47,141
getting me things I need...

371
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:48,376
Such as?

372
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:51,354
Well, for instance, a
transporter for a few hours.

373
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,451
Didn't I hear somewhere

374
00:18:55,497 --> 00:18:59,061
that a transporter was involved
in the first crossover?

375
00:18:59,103 --> 00:19:01,005
That's right.

376
00:19:05,581 --> 00:19:08,211
Do you have a way back
to your side, Major?

377
00:19:08,253 --> 00:19:11,281
Under the right circumstances,
I might be willing

378
00:19:11,324 --> 00:19:13,794
to help you get access
to a transporter.

379
00:19:13,829 --> 00:19:15,058
Look, Quark.

380
00:19:15,098 --> 00:19:17,591
I don't have a strip
of gold-pressed latinum

381
00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:19,264
so don't even think about it.

382
00:19:19,306 --> 00:19:21,606
Gold-pressed what?

383
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:24,878
What is it you want?

384
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:29,117
The ability to send others
across to your side.

385
00:19:29,157 --> 00:19:30,557
Others?
What others?

386
00:19:30,593 --> 00:19:31,891
That's not important.

387
00:19:31,995 --> 00:19:34,557
Look, I can't open
a revolving door to...

388
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,000
Quark!

389
00:19:38,607 --> 00:19:40,439
Mr. Garak!

390
00:19:40,478 --> 00:19:41,605
What can I get you today?

391
00:19:41,646 --> 00:19:44,014
Drinks are always
on the house for you.

392
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,848
You must come with us.

393
00:19:45,887 --> 00:19:47,914
Is there a problem?

394
00:19:47,991 --> 00:19:49,357
Yes, a slight problem.

395
00:19:49,393 --> 00:19:52,296
You've been helping Terrans
escape from the station.

396
00:19:52,332 --> 00:19:54,802
Me? I'm a simple barkeep
and a coward.

397
00:19:54,836 --> 00:19:57,170
I assure you, I don't stick
my neck out for anyone.

398
00:19:57,207 --> 00:20:00,235
That's not what the Terran
we caught this morning

399
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:02,306
told us during
his interrogation.

400
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,252
This is all a misunderstanding.

401
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:05,346
Hmm...

402
00:20:05,389 --> 00:20:06,823
I assure you...

403
00:20:17,577 --> 00:20:18,670
I shall miss him.

404
00:20:18,712 --> 00:20:20,180
He always let me win at dabo.

405
00:20:20,215 --> 00:20:21,183
Bartender!

406
00:20:21,217 --> 00:20:22,344
He's just been arrested.

407
00:20:22,386 --> 00:20:23,513
Arrested?

408
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,821
What a damned shame.

409
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:28,625
Who wants a drink on the house?

410
00:20:28,664 --> 00:20:30,189
Here, I do!

411
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:31,462
Two!

412
00:20:32,637 --> 00:20:34,401
Just give me the bottle.

413
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,000
Don't be stingy!

414
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:48,925
Here.

415
00:20:57,984 --> 00:21:00,181
Miles O'Brien.

416
00:21:02,825 --> 00:21:05,125
I know you, on my side.

417
00:21:05,162 --> 00:21:06,323
Yeah?

418
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,802
Actually, we're best friends.

419
00:21:10,507 --> 00:21:11,600
You and me?

420
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,440
That's right.

421
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:16,849
What am l...
some kind of doctor, too?

422
00:21:16,886 --> 00:21:19,220
No, you're Chief of Operations
of this station.

423
00:21:19,257 --> 00:21:21,250
Me? Go on.

424
00:21:21,293 --> 00:21:23,354
It's true.

425
00:21:25,835 --> 00:21:28,305
Chief of Operations.

426
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:31,242
Looks like you know your way
around machines.

427
00:21:31,278 --> 00:21:33,248
Well, I know some things.

428
00:21:33,282 --> 00:21:37,153
What else is he like,
this Chief of Operations?

429
00:21:37,188 --> 00:21:38,417
Ah, he's married.

430
00:21:38,457 --> 00:21:40,119
He has a five-year-old daughter.

431
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,153
He's one of the most
decent men I know.

432
00:21:42,197 --> 00:21:44,667
We fought our way
out of a few scrapes together.

433
00:21:44,702 --> 00:21:46,068
I admire him a great deal.

434
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:48,666
Sounds like he got
the lucky draw

435
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:50,769
between me and him.

436
00:21:53,451 --> 00:21:56,685
Have you ever done much
work on transporters?

437
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:57,816
Me?

438
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,690
Yeah, some.
Why?

439
00:21:59,729 --> 00:22:01,561
Well, the Chief O'Brien I know

440
00:22:01,598 --> 00:22:04,000
is an expert
in transporter technology.

441
00:22:04,036 --> 00:22:06,063
I wouldn't call myself
an expert

442
00:22:06,107 --> 00:22:08,168
but I know as much
as any Terran.

443
00:22:08,211 --> 00:22:10,009
I hope that'll be enough.

444
00:22:10,047 --> 00:22:11,174
Enough for what?

445
00:22:11,216 --> 00:22:12,946
We think that a transporter

446
00:22:12,987 --> 00:22:15,253
will help us get
back to our side.

447
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,815
What?

448
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,023
You're filling me up
with this stuff

449
00:22:19,063 --> 00:22:21,431
just to get me to help you,
is that it?

450
00:22:21,468 --> 00:22:23,461
No, everything
I've told you is the truth.

451
00:22:23,505 --> 00:22:25,566
I don't know you.

452
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:28,102
I'm not your friend.

453
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:29,672
I'm not your friend!

454
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,743
Meal break is over.

455
00:22:34,258 --> 00:22:36,090
You're wanted in the bar.

456
00:22:37,463 --> 00:22:38,624
Look, if I don't finish here...

457
00:22:38,665 --> 00:22:41,831
You're wanted
in the bar by Mr. Sisko.

458
00:22:52,957 --> 00:22:54,721
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

459
00:22:54,795 --> 00:22:56,388
Yes.

460
00:22:57,399 --> 00:22:58,731
Look at this.

461
00:22:58,768 --> 00:23:00,600
Do you believe it?

462
00:23:00,639 --> 00:23:04,874
She called me all the way
from the Fowla system

463
00:23:04,913 --> 00:23:06,575
to see you.

464
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:13,759
Not only do you look like her,
you have the same temper.

465
00:23:14,931 --> 00:23:16,833
You and your friends
don't seem

466
00:23:16,868 --> 00:23:19,236
like the other Terrans
I've seen here.

467
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:22,870
The Intendant honors me
with a ship and a crew.

468
00:23:22,911 --> 00:23:25,438
I honor her
by collecting duties...

469
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:32,084
of a sort... from vessels
that pass in this direction.

470
00:23:32,129 --> 00:23:35,590
And why do you deserve
this special treatment?

471
00:23:35,635 --> 00:23:38,037
I suppose because I amuse her

472
00:23:38,073 --> 00:23:41,443
and she's not easily amused.

473
00:23:41,478 --> 00:23:45,747
And it seems
that you amuse her, too.

474
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,550
You wanted to see me, Mr. Sisko.

475
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:52,962
Hello, Smiley.

476
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:54,297
How are you?

477
00:23:54,335 --> 00:23:56,099
It's Miles, Mr. Sisko.

478
00:23:56,138 --> 00:23:57,697
I don't like "Miles."

479
00:23:57,741 --> 00:24:00,177
That's why I named you Smiley.

480
00:24:00,212 --> 00:24:03,081
Are they treating you okay,
Smiley?

481
00:24:03,118 --> 00:24:04,313
Just fine.

482
00:24:04,353 --> 00:24:06,414
What do you need?

483
00:24:06,456 --> 00:24:09,917
You don't like me,
do you, Smiley?

484
00:24:09,963 --> 00:24:12,024
Not really, Mr. Sisko.

485
00:24:14,471 --> 00:24:17,169
Ah, and you're not afraid
to show it, are you?

486
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,737
I suppose that's why
I like you so much.

487
00:24:19,814 --> 00:24:22,649
My impulse driver coil
isn't operational.

488
00:24:22,686 --> 00:24:23,745
Take care of it.

489
00:24:23,821 --> 00:24:25,119
I've got a serious problem

490
00:24:25,157 --> 00:24:27,320
in ore processing
that's got to be fixed...

491
00:24:27,361 --> 00:24:31,494
I don't care what's going on
in ore processing.

492
00:24:31,535 --> 00:24:33,163
Fix my engine.

493
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:34,571
Hmm?

494
00:24:36,845 --> 00:24:38,643
Kira to Sisko.

495
00:24:38,681 --> 00:24:40,479
Go ahead.

496
00:24:40,517 --> 00:24:42,383
I'd like to discuss
your recent mission.

497
00:24:42,421 --> 00:24:45,085
Would you please report
to my quarters?

498
00:25:06,832 --> 00:25:09,462
There she is.

499
00:25:09,504 --> 00:25:11,974
Have you met my friend,
Benjamin Sisko, my dear?

500
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:18,352
Tell us...

501
00:25:18,386 --> 00:25:21,790
is there another one
of him on your side?

502
00:25:21,825 --> 00:25:24,352
Yes, there is.

503
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:27,129
Is he as loyal and true as mine?

504
00:25:28,438 --> 00:25:30,066
He's a good man.

505
00:25:30,107 --> 00:25:32,509
Oh, I'm sorry he didn't
come with you.

506
00:25:32,545 --> 00:25:35,779
Wouldn't that have been
something, Benjamin?

507
00:25:35,818 --> 00:25:37,411
Two of you by my side.

508
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:39,082
I need to check my ship.

509
00:25:39,123 --> 00:25:40,113
Benjamin!

510
00:25:41,127 --> 00:25:43,791
Did I hurt your feelings?

511
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,737
I never had any to hurt,
Intendant.

512
00:25:53,449 --> 00:25:58,049
Now, what is this I hear
about you wanting a transporter?

513
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,822
Quark mentioned something
about it

514
00:26:00,863 --> 00:26:02,559
during his interrogation.

515
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:05,765
I did ask him about
a transporter, that's true.

516
00:26:05,805 --> 00:26:07,103
But why?

517
00:26:07,141 --> 00:26:09,373
Well, you know I'm looking
for a way back.

518
00:26:09,412 --> 00:26:11,974
A transporter was responsible
for the first crossover.

519
00:26:12,016 --> 00:26:14,953
And if you had come to me,
I would have told you

520
00:26:14,988 --> 00:26:17,618
all transporters
were redesigned afterwards

521
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:20,927
to make sure the same thing
would never happen again.

522
00:26:20,965 --> 00:26:23,265
It won't work.

523
00:26:23,303 --> 00:26:26,833
So... why didn't you come to me?

524
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:28,970
You're very busy.

525
00:26:31,484 --> 00:26:33,977
You don't trust me.

526
00:26:34,022 --> 00:26:38,463
I'm... a little afraid of you.

527
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:40,660
Then you fear yourself.

528
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:43,297
I don't want your fear.

529
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:45,468
I want your love.

530
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:48,571
If you can't love me, who can?

531
00:26:49,917 --> 00:26:51,715
Don't be in such a hurry to go.

532
00:26:51,753 --> 00:26:53,016
I'm glad you're here.

533
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:56,084
There is so much we can learn
from one another.

534
00:26:56,128 --> 00:27:00,762
Intendant, Garak is here
with the prisoner.

535
00:27:00,804 --> 00:27:02,067
Send him in.

536
00:27:05,311 --> 00:27:07,007
He's made a full confession

537
00:27:07,048 --> 00:27:10,316
and implicated two others,
who have been arrested.

538
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:16,991
Quark.

539
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,809
I have always liked you,
you know that.

540
00:27:22,843 --> 00:27:26,646
I have nothing but respect
for you, Intendant.

541
00:27:26,683 --> 00:27:28,481
I'm so sorry.

542
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,786
You did it because you felt
sorry for these Terrans.

543
00:27:30,824 --> 00:27:34,490
You hate to see them suffer,
just as I do.

544
00:27:34,531 --> 00:27:35,829
Yes, Intendant.

545
00:27:35,867 --> 00:27:38,667
But where would we be
without them?

546
00:27:38,705 --> 00:27:42,371
Who would perform the labor
for the Alliance?

547
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,018
A quick death.

548
00:27:46,052 --> 00:27:48,318
Don't make him suffer anymore.

549
00:27:48,356 --> 00:27:50,154
No, Intendant, please.

550
00:27:50,192 --> 00:27:52,526
I made a mistake.
Have mercy!

551
00:27:52,563 --> 00:27:54,054
No, please!

552
00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:57,002
I've planned a party
for us tonight.

553
00:27:58,006 --> 00:27:59,942
What shall we wear?

554
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:07,279
Lovely.

555
00:28:07,323 --> 00:28:10,625
I do admire
a well-tailored gown.

556
00:28:10,662 --> 00:28:13,258
What are you doing
in my quarters, Garak?

557
00:28:13,301 --> 00:28:16,170
She'll never let you leave,
you know.

558
00:28:16,206 --> 00:28:17,367
Can't you tell?

559
00:28:17,408 --> 00:28:18,603
She's in love.

560
00:28:18,644 --> 00:28:20,112
What are you talking about?

561
00:28:20,146 --> 00:28:22,173
In love with you, my dear.

562
00:28:22,217 --> 00:28:24,517
She's all atwitter about you.

563
00:28:24,554 --> 00:28:27,457
Can't talk about anyone else.

564
00:28:27,493 --> 00:28:30,293
You're the perfect gift
for the girl who has everything.

565
00:28:30,331 --> 00:28:32,563
She's taken you into her heart

566
00:28:32,602 --> 00:28:37,066
like a Drathan puppy lig
left on her doorstep.

567
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:40,947
Who else could she share
her deepest secrets with

568
00:28:41,017 --> 00:28:45,890
tell her troubles to,
trust with her life?

569
00:28:45,926 --> 00:28:49,296
All you have to do is take
a look at the guard outside

570
00:28:49,331 --> 00:28:51,233
to see how much she trusts me.

571
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:52,828
I arranged the guard.

572
00:28:52,871 --> 00:28:54,841
Oh, she trusts you.

573
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:57,903
As much as she trusts anyone.

574
00:28:57,947 --> 00:29:00,918
So, who better to betray her?

575
00:29:00,953 --> 00:29:04,722
You're taking quite a risk
coming to me like this.

576
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,460
True career advancement
requires risk.

577
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,098
Consider my offer carefully,
my dear.

578
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,542
She'll never let you go.

579
00:29:14,578 --> 00:29:15,874
I will.

580
00:29:16,007 --> 00:29:18,034
If you want to leave,
you'll assist me.

581
00:29:18,077 --> 00:29:19,306
How?

582
00:29:19,346 --> 00:29:21,076
By taking her place.

583
00:29:21,116 --> 00:29:23,245
What?

584
00:29:23,287 --> 00:29:25,723
Tomorrow morning,
she will be gone.

585
00:29:27,094 --> 00:29:28,153
Gone?

586
00:29:28,195 --> 00:29:29,458
She will be gone.

587
00:29:29,565 --> 00:29:33,470
Please, don't make me use
some foolish euphemism.

588
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:37,376
You will assume her place
as Intendant and announce

589
00:29:37,412 --> 00:29:40,042
that your counterpart
from the other side

590
00:29:40,084 --> 00:29:42,577
has returned
to wherever she came from.

591
00:29:42,621 --> 00:29:45,421
In a few weeks,
you will step down

592
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,158
to embark on a spiritual journey

593
00:29:48,198 --> 00:29:50,930
to explore your <i>pagh</i>
or whatever.

594
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:56,276
And I will take your place
as Intendant.

595
00:29:56,313 --> 00:29:57,747
What about my friend?

596
00:29:57,782 --> 00:29:58,909
The good Doctor.

597
00:29:58,951 --> 00:30:01,751
Yes, he'll be taken off
the station

598
00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:04,989
and treated
to as much hospitality

599
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:09,196
as we Cardassians can offer
until you resign.

600
00:30:09,236 --> 00:30:12,766
And then you can be
happily reunited.

601
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:19,051
Oh, I've made arrangements
with his supervisor

602
00:30:19,087 --> 00:30:23,390
that, if you should decide
to decline my offer

603
00:30:23,429 --> 00:30:27,095
tomorrow, it will be
your Doctor friend

604
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:28,865
who will be gone.

605
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,466
We've got to get out
of here tonight.

606
00:30:46,503 --> 00:30:47,766
Why?
What's happened?

607
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:48,966
I don't have time to explain.

608
00:30:49,007 --> 00:30:50,600
Just watch your back.
You're in danger.

609
00:30:50,643 --> 00:30:51,702
Why my back?
What kind of danger?

610
00:30:51,745 --> 00:30:53,270
We've got to find a way
back to the runabout.

611
00:30:53,315 --> 00:30:54,283
And then where do we go?

612
00:30:54,317 --> 00:30:55,615
The Alliance controls
the entire Quadrant.

613
00:30:55,719 --> 00:30:56,812
There's still
a wormhole out there

614
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:57,982
they don't know anything about.

615
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,118
Now, I'm not sure whether
it'll get us back or not.

616
00:31:00,161 --> 00:31:02,688
All I know is,
we can't stay here any longer.

617
00:31:02,732 --> 00:31:04,496
How are we supposed to get
past their security?

618
00:31:04,535 --> 00:31:06,767
I'm trying to find some help.

619
00:31:06,806 --> 00:31:08,935
I've heard Quark has helped
some Terrans escape.

620
00:31:08,977 --> 00:31:10,172
No, it's too late for Quark.

621
00:31:10,212 --> 00:31:11,271
Stay alert.

622
00:31:11,314 --> 00:31:13,944
If our chance comes,
there won't be much warning.

623
00:31:30,983 --> 00:31:33,180
Sisko.

624
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,850
Tell her I'm busy.

625
00:31:35,892 --> 00:31:38,260
I have something
important to tell you.

626
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,789
I'm listening.

627
00:31:46,144 --> 00:31:48,205
I have valuable information

628
00:31:48,247 --> 00:31:50,877
and I want something
in exchange.

629
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:53,185
You've gone into business
for yourself, have you?

630
00:31:53,223 --> 00:31:56,525
All I want is to get
off this station.

631
00:31:56,562 --> 00:31:59,226
I want my runabout back.

632
00:32:02,072 --> 00:32:04,599
And you expect me to help you?

633
00:32:04,643 --> 00:32:06,407
She'll have my head.

634
00:32:07,582 --> 00:32:09,414
Or something else.

635
00:32:10,754 --> 00:32:12,382
Not if you save her life.

636
00:32:12,424 --> 00:32:13,619
Her life?

637
00:32:13,727 --> 00:32:17,427
Garak is planning
to kill her... tonight.

638
00:32:18,502 --> 00:32:19,731
That's it?

639
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,139
That's the valuable information?

640
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:26,581
Garak has been trying to kill
her since the day he got here.

641
00:32:26,616 --> 00:32:29,018
He wants me to take her place.

642
00:32:29,054 --> 00:32:30,784
Well, now...

643
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:34,785
that's more creative
than he usually gets.

644
00:32:37,636 --> 00:32:39,538
I wouldn't worry about it.

645
00:32:42,979 --> 00:32:44,845
What kind of a man are you?

646
00:32:44,883 --> 00:32:46,944
You're disturbing my nap.

647
00:32:46,986 --> 00:32:51,791
The Benjamin Sisko I know
would never sell his soul

648
00:32:51,828 --> 00:32:54,697
and allow himself to become
part of this tyranny

649
00:32:54,767 --> 00:32:56,292
against his own people.

650
00:32:56,337 --> 00:32:57,703
Terrans don't have souls.

651
00:32:57,772 --> 00:32:58,865
We don't believe in them.

652
00:32:58,908 --> 00:33:00,433
Well, what do
Terrans believe in?

653
00:33:00,477 --> 00:33:01,604
Raising their children

654
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,014
to dig ore out of the mines
for the Alliance?

655
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:06,247
I worked in the mines, too,
till I was old enough

656
00:33:06,288 --> 00:33:07,779
to start fighting
for my freedom.

657
00:33:07,824 --> 00:33:10,158
What do you care
about Terrans' freedom?

658
00:33:10,195 --> 00:33:12,131
I care about freedom.

659
00:33:12,164 --> 00:33:15,762
What I don't understand
is why you don't care.

660
00:33:15,804 --> 00:33:18,036
Why the only one
on this station I have met

661
00:33:18,075 --> 00:33:21,069
who seemed to give a damn
was a Ferengi toad named Quark.

662
00:33:21,115 --> 00:33:25,077
You're looking in the wrong
place for a hero, ma'am.

663
00:33:25,122 --> 00:33:29,027
I've made the best
of a bad life for my crew.

664
00:33:29,062 --> 00:33:31,089
That's my contribution.

665
00:33:31,133 --> 00:33:36,097
Yes, you charmed
your way out of the mines

666
00:33:36,142 --> 00:33:38,544
but you and I both know

667
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:42,018
you're no less a victim
than anyone else here.

668
00:34:02,989 --> 00:34:05,118
My dear...

669
00:34:06,496 --> 00:34:10,458
how breathtaking
you look tonight.

670
00:34:10,503 --> 00:34:14,374
I do hope you'll
save a dance for me

671
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:16,174
later this evening.

672
00:34:19,185 --> 00:34:21,451
After four years
as a personal guard

673
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:22,924
for the House of Duras

674
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:25,987
I was ready to do anything
to get out of there.

675
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:28,501
You never knew if Lursa
and B'Etor were going to be...

676
00:34:29,537 --> 00:34:31,028
Clumsy fool!

677
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:35,609
Stupid Terran pig.

678
00:34:46,801 --> 00:34:49,863
What's wrong, Terran?

679
00:34:49,908 --> 00:34:52,310
Lost your nerve?

680
00:34:52,345 --> 00:34:55,840
Afraid to die today, eh?

681
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:02,852
Get out of my sight.

682
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,169
The Intendant!

683
00:35:11,212 --> 00:35:14,183
Intendant, you look lovely.

684
00:35:14,217 --> 00:35:18,020
Intendant,
what is your pleasure?

685
00:35:18,058 --> 00:35:20,688
Play something bright.

686
00:35:20,729 --> 00:35:22,790
I'm in a happy mood.

687
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:44,602
You're not accustomed
to this workload

688
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:46,700
are you, Doctor?

689
00:35:46,743 --> 00:35:49,305
You have much to learn.

690
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:52,250
It's a shame
this is going to be

691
00:35:52,285 --> 00:35:54,312
your last night on the job.

692
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,522
Engineering, we have
a thorium leak down here!

693
00:36:00,567 --> 00:36:03,594
Release the security locks!

694
00:36:19,056 --> 00:36:21,288
Establish security fields

695
00:36:21,326 --> 00:36:23,796
on all the levels
above and below.

696
00:36:23,831 --> 00:36:26,267
Station guards
at all turbolifts.

697
00:36:26,302 --> 00:36:27,600
Okay, over here.

698
00:36:27,638 --> 00:36:28,970
This way!

699
00:36:29,007 --> 00:36:30,635
He must have gone
below the deck...

700
00:36:31,978 --> 00:36:35,040
You three in back,
come with me.

701
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,024
O'Brien.

702
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:02,897
You've got to help me.

703
00:37:02,934 --> 00:37:04,027
I don't see you.

704
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,698
You're not here.

705
00:37:05,739 --> 00:37:07,503
I'm just trying to seal

706
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,238
this thorium leak.

707
00:37:09,279 --> 00:37:12,740
Look, I don't know my way around
these conduits, but you do.

708
00:37:12,786 --> 00:37:14,049
My O'Brien does.

709
00:37:14,088 --> 00:37:15,522
Uh-uh.

710
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,422
Just tell me where
the runabout pads are.

711
00:37:17,461 --> 00:37:18,759
I know you, Miles O'Brien.

712
00:37:18,797 --> 00:37:21,131
Somewhere inside of you,
there is a shred of decency.

713
00:37:21,168 --> 00:37:22,261
There has to be.

714
00:37:22,302 --> 00:37:24,431
I am a decent man.

715
00:37:24,473 --> 00:37:27,775
I just... I just...

716
00:37:27,813 --> 00:37:29,543
You don't understand.

717
00:37:29,649 --> 00:37:31,778
I can't help you.
I can't.

718
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,152
They'll kill me.

719
00:37:33,189 --> 00:37:34,919
You're already dead.

720
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:37,452
I'm sorry you don't see that.

721
00:37:37,497 --> 00:37:40,936
The life inside
every human being here...

722
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:44,065
every Terran...
died a long time ago.

723
00:37:46,011 --> 00:37:47,240
That's not the right way.

724
00:37:52,624 --> 00:37:54,594
Just tell me one thing.

725
00:37:54,694 --> 00:37:57,597
Is there room
on your ship for me?

726
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,829
You want us to take you with us?

727
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,840
I have no reason to stay here.

728
00:38:01,874 --> 00:38:06,109
Starfleet would probably have
a big problem with that.

729
00:38:06,147 --> 00:38:08,379
To hell with them.
Let's go.

730
00:38:23,379 --> 00:38:25,349
Stop right there!

731
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:32,084
Intendant.

732
00:38:34,966 --> 00:38:37,562
The new Terran killed
the shape-shifter

733
00:38:37,605 --> 00:38:40,167
and O'Brien tried
to help him escape.

734
00:38:46,387 --> 00:38:49,290
This is my fault
for listening to you.

735
00:38:49,326 --> 00:38:52,594
For keeping him alive
in the first place.

736
00:38:56,405 --> 00:39:00,869
I know very little
about where you come from

737
00:39:00,913 --> 00:39:03,440
but, from what I've heard

738
00:39:03,484 --> 00:39:07,321
I think your kind
has a lot to learn.

739
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:09,190
We've got a lot to learn?

740
00:39:09,228 --> 00:39:10,992
What a laugh.

741
00:39:11,031 --> 00:39:12,863
Quiet!

742
00:39:14,671 --> 00:39:20,615
On this side,
Terran workers do not speak

743
00:39:20,648 --> 00:39:23,016
to their superiors
as you do.

744
00:39:23,053 --> 00:39:25,888
They certainly
do not murder them.

745
00:39:30,066 --> 00:39:32,002
He was the only one
of his kind...

746
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,766
the man you killed.

747
00:39:33,806 --> 00:39:35,138
Do you realize that?

748
00:39:35,175 --> 00:39:38,078
He is irreplaceable.

749
00:39:38,113 --> 00:39:42,485
No one ran that operation
as efficiently as he did.

750
00:39:42,521 --> 00:39:45,151
No one kept order
among the workers as he did.

751
00:39:50,602 --> 00:39:52,504
This is my reward...

752
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:57,811
for treating you Terrans
with the least bit of respect.

753
00:39:57,849 --> 00:39:59,681
Very well.

754
00:40:01,789 --> 00:40:04,692
I can learn from my mistakes.

755
00:40:04,727 --> 00:40:06,663
You want to set an example,
Garak.

756
00:40:06,698 --> 00:40:07,666
Use him.

757
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,863
Set an example for all Terrans.

758
00:40:09,903 --> 00:40:13,433
Let him die, slowly, in public
view on the Promenade.

759
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:17,007
Let his pleas for mercy
echo through the corridors

760
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,245
for all Terrans to hear.

761
00:40:18,285 --> 00:40:19,548
Intendant...

762
00:40:19,588 --> 00:40:23,995
Another word from you, and you
will die right beside him.

763
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:28,163
And you...

764
00:40:29,506 --> 00:40:31,476
O'Brien...

765
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:37,886
you tinkerer and putterer
and fixer of broken things

766
00:40:37,921 --> 00:40:41,382
you've been
the perfect theta for years.

767
00:40:41,427 --> 00:40:44,991
What could possibly
have gotten into you?

768
00:40:45,033 --> 00:40:47,128
What were you thinking?

769
00:40:49,308 --> 00:40:51,938
Do you want an answer,
Intendant?

770
00:40:51,979 --> 00:40:53,811
Yes.

771
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:57,956
This man...

772
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:04,457
this man is a doctor
where he comes from

773
00:41:04,502 --> 00:41:07,872
and there's an O'Brien there,
just like me

774
00:41:07,908 --> 00:41:12,315
except he's some kind
of high-up Chief of Operations.

775
00:41:12,349 --> 00:41:14,546
They're Terrans.

776
00:41:14,587 --> 00:41:17,524
Can you believe that?

777
00:41:19,362 --> 00:41:22,094
Maybe it's a fairy tale
he made up

778
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:24,069
but it started me thinking

779
00:41:24,104 --> 00:41:28,237
how... how each of us
might have turned out

780
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:30,714
if history had been
just a little different.

781
00:41:33,287 --> 00:41:37,351
I wanted him
to take me with him

782
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:42,768
because, whatever it's like
where he's from

783
00:41:42,804 --> 00:41:45,400
it's got to be better than this.

784
00:41:47,012 --> 00:41:50,610
There's got to be something
better than this.

785
00:41:50,652 --> 00:41:53,818
Not for you, Mr. O'Brien.

786
00:41:53,924 --> 00:41:57,829
Oh, he's going to be
taking you with him...

787
00:41:57,865 --> 00:42:03,307
just not exactly where you
thought he would be taking you.

788
00:42:10,387 --> 00:42:12,653
No, I don't think so.

789
00:42:14,828 --> 00:42:17,060
Have you lost your mind?

790
00:42:18,568 --> 00:42:19,797
No.

791
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:22,170
I didn't lose it.

792
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:25,077
I just... changed it.

793
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:39,498
Go, go!

794
00:42:43,313 --> 00:42:44,679
She's never going
to let you get away.

795
00:42:44,715 --> 00:42:46,844
She'll track you down
no matter how long it takes.

796
00:42:46,919 --> 00:42:48,683
You may want to consider
following us back to our side.

797
00:42:48,722 --> 00:42:49,690
I've got the feeling

798
00:42:49,724 --> 00:42:51,192
I might not fit in
very well over there.

799
00:42:51,227 --> 00:42:53,197
We'll stay one step
ahead of the law.

800
00:42:53,231 --> 00:42:54,392
Don't worry about us.

801
00:42:54,433 --> 00:42:56,369
Maybe we can stir up
some things on this side.

802
00:42:56,403 --> 00:42:58,201
You're still welcome
to come with us.

803
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,503
I might have something
to stay for now.

804
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:01,135
If you have room on your ship
for me, Mr. Sisko.

805
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:03,205
I can always use
a good tinkerer and putterer.

806
00:43:03,249 --> 00:43:04,274
You're with me, Smiley.

807
00:43:04,317 --> 00:43:05,478
Good luck.

808
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,717
Thank you.

809
00:43:10,729 --> 00:43:12,824
Disengage the docking clamps.

810
00:43:12,933 --> 00:43:14,060
Confirmed.

811
00:43:14,102 --> 00:43:15,070
Firing thrusters.

812
00:43:15,103 --> 00:43:16,162
Thrusters engaged.

813
00:43:16,205 --> 00:43:17,969
Taking us straight to impulse.

814
00:43:18,009 --> 00:43:19,443
Impulse engines on line.

815
00:43:23,485 --> 00:43:24,748
45 seconds to the wormhole.

816
00:43:24,787 --> 00:43:26,483
I'm still reading
a plasma injector leak

817
00:43:26,524 --> 00:43:27,492
from the warp core.

818
00:43:27,525 --> 00:43:28,493
Yeah, I'm hoping that leak

819
00:43:28,527 --> 00:43:29,654
takes us back
where we came from.

820
00:43:29,696 --> 00:43:30,823
I'm matching
speeds and attitude

821
00:43:30,865 --> 00:43:31,890
with our last time through.

822
00:43:33,102 --> 00:43:36,563
Klingon cruiser approaching.

823
00:43:36,609 --> 00:43:39,273
Shields are down to 60 percent.

824
00:43:39,314 --> 00:43:41,112
Forty.

825
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:42,812
Ten seconds to the wormhole.

826
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:44,888
We're hit.

827
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:45,980
Hold on.

828
00:43:57,446 --> 00:43:58,414
Anything?

829
00:43:58,448 --> 00:43:59,541
The search vessels

830
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:01,347
picked up
their warp signature traces.

831
00:44:01,386 --> 00:44:03,948
There was also
an indication of a plasma leak.

832
00:44:03,992 --> 00:44:04,960
But no wreckage?

833
00:44:04,993 --> 00:44:06,120
Nothing.

834
00:44:06,161 --> 00:44:07,561
Reading elevated neutrinos.

835
00:44:07,597 --> 00:44:09,590
Something's coming
through the wormhole.

836
00:44:09,635 --> 00:44:11,126
I can't believe it.
It's them.

837
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:12,399
Benjamin.

838
00:44:12,439 --> 00:44:14,305
They're showing damage
to their deflector grids.

839
00:44:14,343 --> 00:44:16,370
Put them on screen, Mr. O'Brien.

840
00:44:16,413 --> 00:44:18,474
We've got ships
from here to New Bajor

841
00:44:18,517 --> 00:44:19,883
out looking for you.

842
00:44:19,986 --> 00:44:21,454
Where have you been?

843
00:44:22,457 --> 00:44:25,793
Through the looking
glass, Commander.

844
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:28,237
It's good to be back.
