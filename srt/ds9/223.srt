00:00:01,836 --> 00:00:03,629
BASHIR:
<i>Medical Log, supplemental.</i>

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:05,506
<i>Major Kira and I</i>
<i>are returning home</i>

3
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:07,675
<i>after opening the hospital</i>
<i>on New Bajor,</i>

4
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:10,928
<i>the first Bajoran colony</i>
<i>in the Gamma Quadrant.</i>

5
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:12,011
Oh...

6
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:13,347
could you take
it for a while?

7
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,932
Sure.

8
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:16,433
Do you mind
if I listen to some music?

9
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:17,977
Actually, I do.

10
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:19,854
I was hoping to meditate
for a few minutes.

11
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:20,855
Of course.

12
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:23,064
I didn't know
you meditate.

13
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:24,859
Every day.

14
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:26,902
I had the opportunity
of studying meditation

15
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,403
with Isam Helewa
when I was at college.

16
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:29,738
A remarkable fellow.

17
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,198
He sort of took
me under his wing.

18
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:33,325
I can't tell you how much
I learned from him.

19
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,160
The man was a master
at rhythmic breathing.

20
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,872
You'll have to give me
a few tips sometime.

21
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:39,080
Gladly.

22
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,624
Oh, and I'd be more
than interested

23
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,918
in learning any Bajoran
meditation techniques

24
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:44,169
you might like
to show<i> me.</i>

25
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:48,757
We usually just like
to sit...

26
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,801
quietly.

27
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,977
(<i> rapid, loud breathing</i> )

28
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,356
What are you doing?

29
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,402
Bellows breath--

30
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,278
it's a series
of quick intakes,

31
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:13,490
followed by one long intake
of air through the nose.

32
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,700
Hold... release.

33
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,326
Increases the energy flow.

34
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,369
It's quite simple.

35
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,412
Let me show you.

36
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:21,248
How about some music?

37
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,666
Ah. What's your pleasure?

38
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,125
I'm afraid my
musical knowledge

39
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,794
is limited to
Bajoran composers.

40
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,880
Computer, play us
a little something

41
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,715
by Tor Jolan.

42
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:31,174
You know Tor's work?

43
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,467
Oh, I've made it
a point to listen

44
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,261
to Bajoran music
ever since I arrived.

45
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,930
Really?

46
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,806
Tor strikes me as the best
of the lot, really.

47
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,307
Well, slightly derivative

48
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,893
of the great Boldaric masters
of the last century,

49
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:43,353
but pleasantly diverting.

50
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,354
(<i> soothing music plays</i> )

51
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,940
Hmm, this is nice.

52
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,984
I'm glad we're
finally doing this.

53
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,485
What?

54
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,195
Talking to one another.

55
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,031
Finding common interests.

56
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,115
Burying the hatchet.

57
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,450
Hatchet?

58
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,785
A human expression.

59
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:58,911
It means that
we're finally putting

60
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,788
past conflicts behind us.

61
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,414
Making way for
brand-new ones.

62
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:03,916
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
Right.

63
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,085
You know, Nerys...
May I call you Nerys?

64
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:07,669
Sure.

65
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,130
Even when we weren't
getting along,

66
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,132
I've always felt
you were

67
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,760
one of the most
interesting women

68
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,219
I've ever met.

69
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,847
I'm very serious.

70
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,140
Thank you, Doctor.

71
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,850
Julian.

72
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,728
Go on, say it.

73
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,271
Julian.

74
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,982
Julian.

75
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:30,901
It was hard for Chief O'Brien,
as well, at first.

76
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,612
We had our problems, too,
but now we're like this.

77
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:34,905
One minute to
the wormhole.

78
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,824
Stand by to drop
to impulse.

79
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,909
Would you like
to have dinner sometime?

80
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,954
I, uh, I think you'd
better stick with Dax.

81
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:43,038
I'm sorry?

82
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,039
Oh!

83
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,248
(<i> laughs</i> )

84
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,834
You thought
that I was trying to...

85
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:47,835
No, no...

86
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:48,961
My, my mistake.

87
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,211
But if I thought...

88
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,254
Forget it!

89
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,255
Right.

90
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,299
Take us out of warp.

91
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,884
(<i> rumbling</i> )

92
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,176
What's wrong?

93
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,262
The warp field's
not fully collapsed.

94
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,806
I'm showing
a plasma injector leak.

95
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,265
Injector controllers
are locked.

96
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,809
I'm trying
to compensate.

97
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,315
Injectors opening,
velocity falling.

98
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,819
What was that?

99
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,404
Initiating emergency
stabilization control.

100
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,494
(<i> sighs</i> )

101
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:23,996
Are you all right?

102
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:26,665
A little dizzy.

103
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,125
Yeah, me, too.

104
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,170
I guess we're lucky
to be in one piece.

105
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,764
Oh, we'd better get
Mr. O'Brien to take a...

106
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,766
What the hell?

107
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,268
Where's the station?

108
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,521
What happened to the station?

109
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,398
I have it on long-range sensors.

110
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,983
It's...

111
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,151
orbiting Bajor?

112
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,861
Major...

113
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,197
vessel approaching on an
intercept course, dead ahead.

114
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:13,294
What is this?

115
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,756
I'm... sorry, ma'am.

116
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,674
We were not informed
you'd left the station.

117
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:18,717
Who are you?

118
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,219
We were on standard patrol

119
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:22,804
when your vessel seemed
to appear out of nowhere.

120
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,848
If you will allow
us to withdraw

121
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,892
we will escort you
back to the station.

122
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,449
I was as close to her
as I am to you.

123
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,742
She cannot be an impostor.

124
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,077
But she is.

125
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,416
What is going on here?

126
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,751
Garak!

127
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:56,797
Yes, my name is Garak.

128
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,381
The question is...

129
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,760
who...

130
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,762
are you?

131
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:05,133
This... may sound
like an odd question,

132
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:09,221
but... could you tell us
where we are?

133
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,972
This is the Terok Nor station.

134
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,850
The center of authority
for the Bajoran Sector.

135
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,144
"Center of authority."

136
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,355
<i>Whose</i> authority?

137
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,523
The Alliance, of course.

138
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,942
Something is very wrong here.

139
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,194
I think we took a wrong turn
in the wormhole.

140
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,362
Wormhole?

141
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,781
The wormhole to the Gamma...

142
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,617
It's very difficult to explain.

143
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,952
I think it would be best

144
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,037
if we just got back
to our ship and...

145
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,414
WOMAN:
No!

146
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:36,497
I don't think so.

147
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,707
Now, wait a minute.

148
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,877
Don't take that tone
with us, Terran.

149
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:41,962
Terran?

150
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,047
If you are who I
suspect you are,

151
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,133
I'm afraid I can't
run the risk

152
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,717
of letting you go.

153
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,094
Take that one below.

154
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,511
Put him to work.

155
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,931
Tell the supervisor
to keep an eye on him.

156
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,933
He won't know the rules.

157
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,854
(<i> murmuring voices</i> )

158
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,156
GUARD:
Move, Terrans! Move!

159
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,492
MAN:
Intendant!

160
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,829
What is it you need, Telok?

161
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,705
This Terran was caught
trying to stow away

162
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:18,915
on one of the
freighters

163
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,126
leaving the station.

164
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:28,049
What is your
designation?

165
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:31,261
0413-Theta.

166
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,220
Theta.

167
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,181
Yes, ma'am.

168
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,640
You worked so hard

169
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,725
to earn your
Theta designation,

170
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:38,977
to earn our trust.

171
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,646
Why do you throw
it away like this?

172
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,231
Reassign him to Lambda.

173
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,066
Send him to the mines.

174
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,860
The mines?
But he should die for this.

175
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,070
We should make
an example of him.

176
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,072
You have made a career

177
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,574
out of setting
examples, Garak.

178
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,161
I think you enjoy it too much.

179
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:59,122
He could never have gotten on
board that ship without help.

180
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,416
This is the third
incident in a month.

181
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,625
At least, allow me

182
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,002
to interrogate him.

183
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,046
Fine.
Interrogate him.

184
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,756
But if he dies
under your interrogation,

185
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:12,052
I will make you<i> my</i> example.

186
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,428
Is that clear?

187
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:16,431
Very, Intendant.

188
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,523
(<i> deep hum of machinery</i> )

189
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,233
O'BRIEN:
I'm telling you.

190
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,026
If you don't upgrade the
thorium containment cells,

191
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,487
there's going to be an accident,
and I'm not going

192
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:31,988
to be responsible
for the consequences.

193
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,076
Another worker for you--

194
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,952
a Terran who doesn't know
the rules.

195
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,455
Well!

196
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,250
We'll see to it
that he learns them.

197
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,126
What's your designation?

198
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,045
Bashir, Julian.

199
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,005
Is that a joke?

200
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,132
I don't know.
Is it?

201
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,175
(<i> groans</i> )

202
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,010
No jokes.

203
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,097
That's my Rule
of Obedience Number 14.

204
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,807
Now, what's
your designation?

205
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,561
I don't have
a designation.

206
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:05,480
I don't have
a designation,<i> sir.</i>

207
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,981
Another Rule
of Obedience?

208
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,236
I don't have a designation,

209
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,572
<i>sir.</i>

210
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:17,409
I don't have a designation, sir.

211
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,119
Now, why is that?

212
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,870
I don't know.

213
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,789
And frankly, I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

214
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,999
You're here to process ore.

215
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,377
Have you ever done that before?

216
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,045
No, I haven't.

217
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,172
Have you ever worked
in the mines?

218
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,215
No.

219
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,134
Then what have you done?

220
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,094
I've been practicing medicine.

221
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,889
Did you forget
Rule of Obedience

222
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,975
Number 14?

223
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,893
It's not a joke.

224
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,312
I am a doctor.

225
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,854
Well, Doctor,

226
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:50,191
don't forget to scrub
before you operate.

227
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:19,971
Oh, sit down.

228
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,604
You are me, aren't you?

229
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,648
I am Kira Nerys.

230
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,566
That makes two of us.

231
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,901
Where you come from

232
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:37,155
things are very much
like this, aren't they?

233
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:40,699
There's a station,
a Bajor, Cardassians,

234
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,118
Terrans,
Klingons.

235
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,162
The players
are all the same,

236
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:47,582
but... everyone seems to be
playing different parts.

237
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,834
You didn't seem
to recognize the Alliance.

238
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,252
No.

239
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:54,839
Perhaps you'd recognize
the name Kirk.

240
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,425
No, I'm sorry, I don't.

241
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,636
Interesting.

242
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,096
On my side, Kirk is one
of the most famous names

243
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,306
in our history.

244
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,437
Almost a century ago,

245
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,940
a Terran starship captain
named James Kirk

246
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,733
accidentally exchanged places

247
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,611
with his counterpart
from your side

248
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,530
due to a transporter accident.

249
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:22,950
Our Terrans were
barbarians then,

250
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,203
but their empire was strong.

251
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,622
While your Kirk
was on this side,

252
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,165
he met a Vulcan named Spock

253
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,252
and somehow had
a profound influence on him.

254
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,171
Afterwards, Spock rose
to Commander in Chief

255
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:41,094
of the Empire by preaching
reforms, disarmament, peace.

256
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:46,725
It was quite a remarkable
turnabout for his people.

257
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,809
Unfortunately for them,

258
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:52,063
when Spock had completed
all his reforms,

259
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:55,483
his Empire was no longer
in any position

260
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,110
to defend itself
against us.

261
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,528
Us?

262
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:02,115
The Alliance,
the historic coming-together

263
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,118
of the Klingons
and the Cardassians.

264
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,955
And Bajor is a part
of this Alliance?

265
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,583
We'd been under Terran
occupation for decades.

266
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,959
When we were freed,

267
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,712
we petitioned
for entry and were accepted.

268
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:20,007
We have become quite
an influential power

269
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,509
within the Alliance.

270
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,803
Is it similar at
all on your side?

271
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:25,888
No.

272
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,475
My Bajor is not so fortunate.

273
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,436
I'd be very interested
to hear more about it.

274
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,521
I can't stay here.

275
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,565
You must see that.

276
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:39,653
Well, you see,
that's part of the problem.

277
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:43,114
I don't know
how to send you back.

278
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:45,700
But more than that...

279
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,120
there's a...

280
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,207
a certain protocol
I'm supposed to follow.

281
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,336
I'm not sure what you mean.

282
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,673
After the first crossover,

283
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:04,010
we were afraid others might come
to interfere in our affairs.

284
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,554
It was decided then
that if it ever happened again,

285
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,014
we would promptly dispose

286
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,891
of anyone who
appeared from
your side.

287
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,019
I see.

288
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,731
Unlike my First Officer,
Mr. Garak,

289
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,859
I have no taste for violence.

290
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:25,072
I regret using it,
even when it seems necessary.

291
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,117
I know exactly what you mean.

292
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,328
You do, don't you?

293
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,955
I know you
don't want to kill me,

294
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:36,668
and you're searching
for a good reason not to.

295
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,547
Got any ideas?

296
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,883
My side needs what you have--
a strong Bajor.

297
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,386
If you knew the struggles
we've been through

298
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,887
to rebuild our world...

299
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,807
Who's to say you won't
influence us this time?

300
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,266
Me?

301
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,102
My side once changed
the course of your history.

302
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,564
Well, maybe this time,
your side can change mine.

303
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,191
Maybe you can teach me
what I need to know

304
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:03,944
to become the leader
of Bajor, as you have.

305
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,780
That appeals to me.

306
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,615
If I can find a way back.

307
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,451
But... I will have
to kill your friend.

308
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,494
No, don't.

309
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,704
If you knew him...

310
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:15,206
He's an arrogant Terran
who's lived

311
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,208
a privileged life
on my side.

312
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,753
Let him see how
the other half lives.

313
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,546
No, it's too
dangerous.

314
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,590
The Cardassians
and the Klingons

315
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,132
would never allow it.

316
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:29,846
Are you the leader
of this sector or not?

317
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,014
(<i> laughs</i> )

318
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,641
Oh!

319
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,935
You know how
to manipulate me.

320
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,521
I know how I'd feel
in your place.

321
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,231
I wouldn't
give a damn

322
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:43,526
what the Cardassians
or the Klingons thought.

323
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,570
You're right.

324
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,740
I don't.

325
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,077
(<i> beep</i> )

326
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,664
Find this...

327
00:15:56,664 --> 00:16:01,043
<i>attractive</i> young woman
some quarters.

328
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,716
Kira Nerys,

329
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,760
I'll call for you later.

330
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,486
The Intendant
informed me

331
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,738
you'd be inspecting
the facilities.

332
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,449
If there's anything
I can explain...

333
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,952
No. I've worked
in ore processing, myself.

334
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:35,745
(<i> chuckles</i> )

335
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:38,205
Is my Terran friend
behaving himself?

336
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,835
They<i> all</i> behave
themselves when
I'm in charge.

337
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,837
Good.

338
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:47,089
Good. If you don't mind,
I'll speak with him.

339
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,633
Huh?

340
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:49,676
Are you all right?

341
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,135
Learning a new trade.

342
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,136
Do you have any idea
what happened?

343
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,513
Have you ever heard

344
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,389
of a Starfleet Captain
named James Kirk?

345
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,766
Kirk?!

346
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,894
Oh, of course--
the transporter accident.

347
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:00,937
Read about it
at the Academy.

348
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:01,938
So, that's where we are.

349
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:02,981
That's where we are.

350
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:03,982
Is there another me here?

351
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,107
Not on this station.

352
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,776
I haven't found
Dax or Sisko.

353
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,945
O'Brien's been tinkering around
with the machines.

354
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,738
Major, if Kirk got here
by transporter,

355
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,365
do you think we could
get back the same way?

356
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,575
I don't know anything
about transporters. Do you?

357
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,035
Well, no one knows
more about transporters

358
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,662
than Chief O'Brien.

359
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,455
Well,<i> our</i> Chief O'Brien.
Who knows about theirs?

360
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,915
It's worth a shot.

361
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,124
Talk to him.

362
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,626
I'll try to see
if I can find

363
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:24,752
anyone else who might
be willing to help.

364
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,546
Yeah.

365
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:32,426
(<i> conversation and laughter</i> )

366
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,020
QUARK:
You certainly are

367
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,271
the spitting image
of the Intendant...

368
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,273
just as they said.

369
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,150
Hello, Quark.

370
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,028
You know my name.

371
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,112
Quark runs a bar
on my side, too.

372
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,280
Really?

373
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,658
I hope I'm doing
decent business.

374
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,243
Got to be better
than here.

375
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:00,329
The Alliance taxes
are killing me.

376
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,789
What can I get you?

377
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,249
The Intendant likes
a hot<i> jumja</i> tea

378
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,166
this time of day.

379
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,586
Well, I'm not her,

380
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,088
but that does
sound good.

381
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,339
Coming up.

382
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:18,681
So, uh, are we close friends
on your side?

383
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,684
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, we are.

384
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:25,145
On my side, Quark does
me a lot of favors.

385
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,856
Favors?

386
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,775
The Quark I know...

387
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,693
well, he just
has the ability

388
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,361
to get things done
when no one else can.

389
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,696
You know what I mean?

390
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,949
Sometimes he even
gets things done

391
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,701
behind the backs of
the security people.

392
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,661
What kind of favors
do you ask him for?

393
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,372
Oh, all sorts
of favors, like...

394
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,665
getting me things I need...

395
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,084
Such as?

396
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:49,295
Well, for instance, a
transporter for a few hours.

397
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,382
Didn't I hear somewhere

398
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,719
that a transporter was involved
in the first crossover?

399
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,554
That's right.

400
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,895
Do you have a way back
to your side, Major?

401
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,689
Under the right
circumstances,

402
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,942
I might be willing
to help you get access

403
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:12,026
to a transporter.

404
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,486
Look, Quark.

405
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,822
I don't have a strip of
gold-pressed latinum,

406
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:16,990
so don't even
think about it.

407
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,118
Gold-pressed what?

408
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:22,578
What is it
you want?

409
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,623
The ability to send
others across

410
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:26,833
to your side.

411
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,042
Others? What others?

412
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,753
That's not important.

413
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,046
Look, I can't open
a revolving door to...

414
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,506
Quark!

415
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,344
Mr. Garak!

416
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,679
What can I get you today?

417
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,931
Drinks are always on the house
for you.

418
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,766
You must come with us.

419
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,852
Is there a problem?

420
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,436
Yes, a slight problem.

421
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,106
You've been helping Terrans
escape from the station.

422
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,817
Me? I'm a simple barkeep
and a coward.

423
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,902
I assure you, I don't stick
my neck out for anyone.

424
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,446
That's not what the Terran
we caught this morning

425
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,199
told us during
his interrogation.

426
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,993
This is all
a misunderstanding.

427
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:03,285
Hmm...

428
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,787
I assure you...

429
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,128
(<i> yelling</i> )

430
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,590
I shall miss him.

431
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,258
He always let me win at dabo.

432
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,218
Bartender!

433
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,260
He's just been arrested.

434
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,554
Arrested?

435
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,931
What a damned shame.

436
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,475
Who wants a drink on the house?

437
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,268
MAN:
Here, I do!

438
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,311
Two!

439
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,813
(<i> laughing</i> )

440
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,439
MAN 2:
Just give me
the bottle.

441
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,941
WOMAN:
Don't be stingy!

442
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,655
(<i> deep, pervasive hum</i> )

443
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,909
(<i> man choking</i> )

444
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,787
Here.

445
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,840
Miles O'Brien.

446
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,803
I know you,
on my side.

447
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,013
Yeah?

448
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,806
Actually, we're
best friends.

449
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,852
You and me?

450
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,562
That's right.

451
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:15,024
What am I--
some kind of doctor, too?

452
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:17,443
No, you're Chief of Operations
of this station.

453
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,195
Me? Go on.

454
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,405
It's true.

455
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,452
Chief of Operations.

456
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,455
Looks like you know your way
around machines.

457
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,540
Well, I know some things.

458
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,294
What else is he like,
this Chief of Operations?

459
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,629
Ah, he's married.

460
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,172
He has a five-year-old daughter.

461
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:40,258
He's one of the most
decent men I know.

462
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:42,843
We fought our way
out of a few scrapes together.

463
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,178
I admire him a great deal.

464
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,889
Sounds like he got
the lucky draw

465
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,808
between me and him.

466
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,981
Have you ever done much
work on transporters?

467
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:55,982
Me?

468
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,566
Yeah, some.
Why?

469
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,110
Well, the Chief
O'Brien I know

470
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,113
is an expert in
transporter technology.

471
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:04,240
I wouldn't call myself
an expert,

472
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,284
but I know as much
as any Terran.

473
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:08,202
I hope that'll be enough.

474
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:09,245
Enough for what?

475
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,038
We think that
a transporter

476
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,249
will help us get
back to our side.

477
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:14,917
What?

478
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:17,086
You're filling me up
with this stuff

479
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,463
just to get me to help you,
is that it?

480
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,590
No, everything
I've told you is the truth.

481
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,676
I don't know you.

482
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:26,262
I'm not your friend.

483
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:27,680
I'm not your friend!

484
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,723
ODO:
Meal break
is over.

485
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,228
You're wanted in the bar.

486
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:35,688
(<i> sighs</i> )

487
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:36,730
Look, if I don't
finish here...

488
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,857
You're wanted

489
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,817
in the bar by Mr. Sisko.

490
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:51,078
(<i> raucous laughter</i> )

491
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,913
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

492
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,372
Yes.

493
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,876
Look at this.

494
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,836
Do you believe it?

495
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:03,049
She called me all the way
from the Fowla system

496
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,758
to see you.

497
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,596
Not only do you
look like her,

498
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,724
you have the same temper.

499
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:14,894
You and your friends
don't seem

500
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,355
like the other Terrans
I've seen here.

501
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:19,190
The Intendant honors me

502
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,900
with a ship and a crew.

503
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,361
I honor her by
collecting duties--

504
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:25,738
(<i> all laughing</i> )

505
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,614
of a sort-- from vessels

506
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:30,201
that pass in
this direction.

507
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:33,620
And why do you deserve
this special treatment?

508
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,998
I suppose because
I amuse her,

509
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:39,626
and she's not
easily amused.

510
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:43,839
And it seems that
you amuse her, too.

511
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,674
O'BRIEN:
You wanted to see me, Mr. Sisko.

512
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:51,097
Hello, Smiley.

513
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:52,348
How are you?

514
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,183
It's Miles, Mr. Sisko.

515
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:55,726
I don't like "Miles."

516
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:58,229
That's why I named
you Smiley.

517
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:00,981
Are they treating
you okay, Smiley?

518
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,191
Just fine.

519
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:04,651
What do you need?

520
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:07,988
You don't like me,
do you, Smiley?

521
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,116
Not really, Mr. Sisko.

522
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,659
(<i> laughs</i> )

523
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,536
Ah, and you're not afraid
to show it, are you?

524
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,790
I suppose that's why
I like you so much.

525
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,418
My impulse driver coil
isn't operational.

526
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:21,585
Take care of it.

527
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,670
I've got a serious problem

528
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,505
in ore processing
that's got to be fixed...

529
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:28,968
I don't care what's going on
in ore processing.

530
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,053
Fix my engine.

531
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,638
Hmm?

532
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,098
(<i> laughs</i> )

533
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:35,099
(<i> beeping</i> )

534
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:36,683
Kira to Sisko.

535
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,602
Go ahead.

536
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,187
KIRA: I'd like to discuss
your recent mission.

537
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,982
Would you please report
to my quarters?

538
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,282
(<i> all laughing</i> )

539
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,839
There she is.

540
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,007
Have you met
my friend

541
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,216
Benjamin Sisko,
my dear?

542
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:15,931
Tell us--

543
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:19,185
is there another one
of<i> him</i> on your side?

544
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,728
Yes, there is.

545
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:24,357
Is he as loyal
and true as mine?

546
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,318
He's a good man.

547
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:29,820
Oh, I'm sorry he didn't
come with you.

548
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,323
Wouldn't that have been
something, Benjamin?

549
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:34,700
Two of you by my side.

550
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,243
I need to
check my ship.

551
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,328
Benjamin!

552
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,998
Did I hurt
your feelings?

553
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,960
I never had any
to hurt, Intendant.

554
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:55,346
Now, what is this I hear
about you wanting a transporter?

555
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:58,057
Quark mentioned something
about it

556
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,933
during his
interrogation.

557
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:03,103
I did ask him about
a transporter, that's true.

558
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,480
But why?

559
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,273
Well, you know I'm looking
for a way back.

560
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:09,193
A transporter was responsible
for the first crossover.

561
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:13,197
And if you had come to me,
I would have told you

562
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,824
all transporters
were redesigned afterwards

563
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,202
to make sure the same thing
would never happen again.

564
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:20,787
It won't work.

565
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:24,124
So... why didn't you come to me?

566
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,168
You're very busy.

567
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,257
You don't trust me.

568
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:35,761
I'm... a little
afraid of you.

569
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,930
Then you fear yourself.

570
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,598
I don't want your fear.

571
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:42,851
I want your love.

572
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,938
If you can't
love me, who can?

573
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,941
Don't be in such
a hurry to go.

574
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,317
I'm glad you're here.

575
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,985
There is so much
we can learn

576
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,362
from one another.

577
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:58,117
Intendant, Garak is here
with the prisoner.

578
00:26:58,117 --> 00:26:59,368
Send him in.

579
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,290
He's made a full confession

580
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,667
and implicated two others,
who have been arrested.

581
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,133
Quark.

582
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,097
I have always liked
you, you know that.

583
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:23,934
I have nothing but respect
for you, Intendant.

584
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:25,811
I'm so sorry.

585
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,063
You did it because
you felt sorry for
these Terrans.

586
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,524
You hate
to see them suffer

587
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:31,817
just as I do.

588
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,026
Yes, Intendant.

589
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:36,071
But where would we
be without them?

590
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:39,699
Who would perform the
labor for the Alliance?

591
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,245
A quick death.

592
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,539
Don't make him suffer anymore.

593
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,541
No, Intendant, please.

594
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,793
I made a mistake.
Have mercy!

595
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,211
No, please!

596
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,089
I've planned a party
for us tonight.

597
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,050
What shall we wear?

598
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,433
GARAK:
Lovely.

599
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:07,769
I do admire
a well-tailored gown.

600
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,356
What are you doing
in my quarters, Garak?

601
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:12,941
She'll never let you leave,
you know.

602
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,568
Can't you tell?

603
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:15,861
She's in love.

604
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,321
What are you talking about?

605
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,573
In love with you, my dear.

606
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:21,699
She's all atwitter about you.

607
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:24,620
Can't talk about
anyone else.

608
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,665
You're the perfect gift
for the girl who has everything.

609
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:29,958
She's taken you into her heart

610
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:34,296
like a Drathan puppy lig
left on her doorstep.

611
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:38,133
Who else could she share
her deepest secrets with,

612
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:43,013
tell her troubles to,
trust with her life?

613
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:45,599
All you have to do is take
a look at the guard outside

614
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,394
to see how much she trusts me.

615
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:50,062
I arranged the guard.

616
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,064
Oh, she trusts you.

617
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:55,108
As much as she trusts anyone.

618
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:58,028
So, who better to betray her?

619
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:01,865
You're taking quite a risk
coming to me like this.

620
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:05,827
True career advancement
requires risk.

621
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:09,289
Consider my offer carefully,
my dear.

622
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,083
She'll never let you go.

623
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,710
I will.

624
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,754
If you want to leave,
you'll assist me.

625
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,963
How?

626
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,757
By taking her place.

627
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,842
What?

628
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,262
Tomorrow morning,
she will be gone.

629
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:25,805
Gone?

630
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,349
She will be gone.

631
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:31,061
Please, don't make me use
some foolish euphemism.

632
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:35,023
You will assume her place
as Intendant and announce

633
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,900
that your counterpart
from the other side

634
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,028
has returned
to wherever she came from.

635
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,448
In a few weeks,
you will step down

636
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:45,075
to embark on a spiritual journey

637
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:48,704
to explore your<i> pagh</i>
or whatever.

638
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:53,959
And I will take your place
as Intendant.

639
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,252
What about my friend?

640
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:56,462
The good Doctor.

641
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:59,548
Yes, he'll be taken off
the station

642
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:01,467
and treated
to as much hospitality

643
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:05,721
as we Cardassians can offer
until you resign.

644
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:10,267
And then you can be
happily reunited.

645
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,813
Oh, I've made
arrangements

646
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,189
with his supervisor

647
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,317
that, if you
should decide

648
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:21,027
to decline my offer,

649
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:24,448
tomorrow, it will be
your Doctor friend

650
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,366
who will be gone.

651
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:43,467
We've got to get out
of here tonight.

652
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:44,677
Why? What's
happened?

653
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:46,011
I don't have time
to explain.

654
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,554
Just watch your back.
You're in danger.

655
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,972
Why my back?
What kind of danger?

656
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,182
We've got to find a way
back to the runabout.

657
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,558
And then where do we go?

658
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:52,810
The Alliance controls
the entire Quadrant.

659
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:53,977
There's still
a wormhole out there

660
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,604
they don't know
anything about.

661
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,147
Now, I'm not sure whether
it'll get us back or not.

662
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,858
All I know is,
we can't stay here any longer.

663
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,735
How are we supposed to get
past their security?

664
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,903
I'm trying to find
some help.

665
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,989
I've heard Quark has helped
some Terrans escape.

666
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,073
No, it's too late
for Quark.

667
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,534
Stay alert.

668
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:10,869
If our chance comes,
there won't be much warning.

669
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,180
Sisko.

670
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,891
Tell her I'm busy.

671
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,268
I have something
important to tell you.

672
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,896
I'm listening.

673
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:45,237
I have valuable
information,

674
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:48,073
and I want something
in exchange.

675
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,367
You've gone into business
for yourself, have you?

676
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:53,412
All I want is to get
off this station.

677
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,415
I want my runabout back.

678
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:59,125
(<i> laughs</i> )

679
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,628
And you expect me to help you?

680
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,296
She'll have my head.

681
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,299
Or something else.

682
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,261
Not if you save
her life.

683
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,804
Her life?

684
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:14,307
Garak is planning
to kill her-- tonight.

685
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,727
That's it?

686
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:19,145
That's the valuable
information?

687
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,147
Garak has been
trying to kill her

688
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,692
since the day
he got here.

689
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:26,152
He wants me to
take her place.

690
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,863
Well, now...

691
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:31,784
that's more creative
than he usually gets.

692
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:34,745
(<i> giggling</i> )

693
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:36,371
I wouldn't worry about it.

694
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,794
What kind of
a man are you?

695
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:44,045
You're disturbing
my nap.

696
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:48,884
The Benjamin Sisko I know
would never sell his soul

697
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:51,720
and allow himself to become
part of this tyranny

698
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,263
against his own people.

699
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:54,431
Terrans
don't have souls.

700
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:55,808
We don't believe
in them.

701
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,267
Well, what<i> do</i>
Terrans believe in?

702
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:58,727
Raising their children

703
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:01,062
to dig ore out of the
mines for the Alliance?

704
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,148
I worked in the mines, too,
till I was old enough

705
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,983
to start fighting
for my freedom.

706
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,152
What do you care
about Terrans' freedom?

707
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:09,154
I care about freedom.

708
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:12,866
What I don't understand
is why you<i> don't</i> care.

709
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:15,118
Why the only one on
this station I have met

710
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,996
who seemed to give a damn was
a Ferengi toad named Quark.

711
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,373
You're looking
in the wrong place

712
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,041
for a hero, ma'am.

713
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:26,004
I've made the best
of a bad life for my crew.

714
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,131
That's my contribution.

715
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:33,052
Yes, you charmed your
way out of the mines,

716
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,555
but you and I both know

717
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:38,809
you're no less a victim
than anyone else here.

718
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:53,198
(<i> buzz of conversation</i> )

719
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,825
(<i> laughing</i> )

720
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:57,619
(<i> playing soft, exotic music)</i>

721
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:02,040
GARAK:
My dear...

722
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:07,587
how breathtaking
you look tonight.

723
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:11,424
I do hope you'll
save a dance for me

After four years

726

for the House of Duras,

727
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:23,144
I was ready to do anything
to get out of there.

728
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,397
You never knew if Lursa
and B'Etor were going to be...

729
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:27,941
Clumsy fool!

730
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:32,654
Stupid Terran pig.

731
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:34,531

733
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:46,919
What's wrong, Terran?

734
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:49,337
Lost your nerve?

735
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:52,925
Afraid to die
today, eh?

736
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,848
Get out of my sight.

your pleasure?

741
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,449

00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,826

You're not accustomed
to this workload,

00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:43,516
are you, Doctor?

748
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:46,227
You have much to learn.

749
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:49,230
It's a shame
this is going to be

750
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,274
your last night
on the job.

O'Brien.

766
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,718
You've got to help me.

767
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,053
I don't see you.

768
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:02,929
You're not here.

769
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,389
I'm just trying to seal

770
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,183
this thorium leak.

771
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:09,352
Look, I don't know my way around
these conduits, but you do.

772
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,854
My O'Brien does.

773
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:12,271
Uh-uh.

774
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:14,066
Just tell me where
the runabout pads are.

775
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:15,734
I know you, Miles O'Brien.

776
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,986
Somewhere inside of you,
there is a shred of decency.

777
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,112
There has to be.

778
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:21,239
I<i> am</i> a decent man.

779
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,743
I just... I just...

780
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,285
You don't understand.

781
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:28,371
I can't help you.
I can't.

782
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,915
They'll kill me.

783
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,833
You're already dead.

784
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,252
I'm sorry you don't see that.

785
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,839
The life inside
every human being here--

786
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,926
every Terran--
died a long time ago.

787
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,096
That's not the right way.

788
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,352
Just tell me one thing.

789
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,480
Is there room
on your ship for me?

790
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,649
You want us to take you with us?

791
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,610
I have no reason to stay here.

792
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:02,781
Starfleet would probably have
a big problem with that.

793
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,991
To hell with them.
Let's go.

794

(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

795
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,967

there!

TELOK:
Intendant.

797
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,062
The new Terran killed
the shape-shifter,

798
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,521
and O'Brien tried

799
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,982
to help him escape.

800
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,949
This is my fault
for listening to you.

801
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:49,202
For keeping him alive
in the first place.

802
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:56,709
I know very little
about where you come from,

803
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,254
but, from what I've heard,

804
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:03,925
I think your kind
has a lot to learn.

805
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,927
<i>We've</i> got a
lot to learn?

806
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,762
What a laugh.

807
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,430
Quiet!

808
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:17,314
On this side,
Terran workers do not speak

809
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:18,982
to their superiors
as you do.

810
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:22,443
They certainly
do not murder them.

811
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,700
He was the only one
of his kind...

812
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,493
the man you killed.

813
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:31,828
Do you realize that?

814
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:34,914
He is irreplaceable.

815
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:39,211
No one ran that operation
as efficiently as he did.

816
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:41,921
No one kept order
among the workers as he did.

817
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,137
This is my reward...

818
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:54,559
for treating you Terrans
with the least bit of respect.

819
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,228
Very well.

820
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:01,316
I can learn from my mistakes.

821
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,193
You want to set
an example, Garak.

822
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:04,361
Use him.

823
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:05,611
Set an example

824
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:06,612
for all Terrans.

825
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:07,822
Let him die

826
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,075
slowly, in public view
on the Promenade.

827
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:13,619
Let his pleas for mercy
echo through the corridors

828
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,163
for all Terrans
to hear.

829
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,539
Intendant...

830
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:19,209
Another word from
you, and you will die

831
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:20,710
right beside him.

832
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:25,090
And you...

833
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,343
O'Brien...

834
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:31,512
you tinkerer and putterer

835
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:34,724
and fixer of broken things,

836
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:38,270
you've been
the perfect theta for years.

837
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:41,689
What could possibly
have gotten into you?

838
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,858
What were you thinking?

839
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:48,654
Do you want an answer,
Intendant?

840
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,531
Yes.

841
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,911
This man...

842
00:40:54,911 --> 00:41:00,959
this man is a doctor
where he comes from,

843
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,711
and there's an O'Brien there,
just like me,

844
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:09,134
except he's some kind
of high-up Chief of Operations.

845
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:11,386
They're Terrans.

846
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:14,222
Can you believe that?

847
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,976
Maybe it's a fairy tale
he made up,

848
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:21,020
but it started me thinking

849
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:25,275
how... how each of us
might have turned out

850
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:27,402
if history had been
just a little different.

851
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:34,242
I wanted him
to take me with him,

852
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:39,580
because, whatever it's like
where he's from,

853
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:43,501
it's got to be better than this.

854
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:47,172
There's got to be something
better than this.

855
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:50,425
Not for you, Mr. O'Brien.

856
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:54,387
Oh, he's going to be
taking you with him...

857
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:59,892
just not exactly where you
thought he would be taking you.

858
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:09,277
No, I don't think so.

859
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:13,490
Have you lost your mind?

860
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:16,409
No.

861
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:17,827
I didn't lose it.

862
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:21,498
I just... changed it.

863
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:35,928
Go, go!

864
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:39,807

865
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:40,892
She's never going
to let you get away.

866
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,018
She'll track you down

867
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:43,686
no matter how
long it takes.

868
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,230
You may want to consider
following us back to our side.

869
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,481
I've got the feeling

870
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:47,899
I might not fit in
very well over there.

871
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:49,526
We'll stay one step
ahead of the law.

872
00:42:49,526 --> 00:42:51,152
Don't worry about us.

873
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:53,029
Maybe we can stir up
some things on<i> this</i> side.

874
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,697
You're still
welcome to
come with us.

875
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,199
I might have something
to stay for now.

876
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,825
if you have room
on your ship for
me, Mr. Sisko.

877
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,536
I can always use
a good tinkerer and putterer.

878
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:00,870
You're with me, Smiley.

879
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,080
Good luck.

880
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,123
Thank you.

881
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,254
Disengage the
docking clamps.

882
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:10,380
Confirmed.

Firing thrusters.

884
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:12,798
Thrusters engaged.

885
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,551
Taking us straight
to impulse.

Impulse engines on line.

45 seconds to
the wormhole.

888
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:22,559
I'm still reading
a plasma injector leak

889
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:23,560
from the warp core.

890
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,810
Yeah, I'm hoping
that leak

891
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,104
takes us back
where we came from.

892
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:27,313
I'm matching speeds
and attitude

893
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:28,647
with our last
time through.

Ten seconds
to the wormhole.

898
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:41,286
We're hit.

899
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:42,328
Hold on.

900
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:54,924
Anything?

901
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:56,175
DAX:
The search vessels

902
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,802
picked up their
warp signature traces.

903
00:43:57,802 --> 00:44:00,513
There was also
an indication of
a plasma leak.

904
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:01,514
But no wreckage?

905
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:02,681
Nothing.

906
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:04,142
O'BRIEN:
Reading elevated
neutrinos.

907
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,935
Something's coming
through the wormhole.

908
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:07,645
I can't believe it.
It's them.

909
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,230
DAX:
Benjamin.

910
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,815
They're showing damage
to their deflector grids.

911
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:12,984
Put them on screen, Mr. O'Brien.

912
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,153
We've got ships
from here to New Bajor

913
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:16,488
out looking for you.

914
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:17,738
Where have you been?

915
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,031
(<i> sighs</i> )

916
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:22,243
Through the looking
glass, Commander.

917
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:24,912
It's good to be back.
