1
00:00:09,951 --> 00:00:13,415
Have you ever seen anything
so disgusting?

2
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,631
The way he's undressing her
with his eyes.

3
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:19,665
And look at his hands!

4
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:21,646
What about his hands?

5
00:00:21,682 --> 00:00:23,277
His gestures... they're obscene.

6
00:00:23,319 --> 00:00:24,379
You should arrest him.

7
00:00:24,422 --> 00:00:25,857
You're joking.

8
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,361
He's pitiful.

9
00:00:29,134 --> 00:00:31,196
Doesn't he realize she loves me?

10
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,731
I don't think he does.

11
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,841
To be honest,
I don't think she does, either.

12
00:00:35,884 --> 00:00:37,855
Thanks for your support.

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,656
Brother,
I just talked to Moogie.

14
00:00:39,694 --> 00:00:41,928
She says Grand Nagus Zek
has disappeared.

15
00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:44,131
What do you mean, disappeared?

16
00:00:44,173 --> 00:00:45,768
He left her a note
saying he was going

17
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,644
on a business safari
to open new territories

18
00:00:47,682 --> 00:00:49,619
- for financial exploitation.
- That's our Nagus.

19
00:00:49,653 --> 00:00:51,556
He said he'd be back
in five days.

20
00:00:51,592 --> 00:00:53,084
That was 12 days ago.

21
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,463
Twelve?

22
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,266
Has he done this before?

23
00:00:56,304 --> 00:00:57,295
Not for this long.

24
00:00:57,341 --> 00:00:58,571
Moogie did some checking.

25
00:00:58,611 --> 00:00:59,773
No one's heard from him.

26
00:00:59,814 --> 00:01:01,147
He could be hurt or even dead.

27
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,414
We have to do something!

28
00:01:02,454 --> 00:01:04,482
He probably stopped off on Risa

29
00:01:04,526 --> 00:01:07,466
you know, for a little rest
and relaxation.

30
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,870
Risa? With all those
gorgeous women?

31
00:01:09,907 --> 00:01:11,935
He wouldn't do that to Moogie.

32
00:01:13,415 --> 00:01:15,545
Have you looked
at our mother lately?

33
00:01:15,588 --> 00:01:17,320
She's not getting any younger.

34
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:19,193
Now, do us both a favor

35
00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:21,795
and stop worrying about Zek.

36
00:01:21,838 --> 00:01:23,137
He'll show up.

37
00:01:23,174 --> 00:01:24,974
Are you sure?

38
00:01:25,012 --> 00:01:26,038
Good-bye, Rom.

39
00:01:26,082 --> 00:01:28,110
Good-bye.

40
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,705
Where'd Ezri go?

41
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,739
Oh, uh, she slipped out the back
with Bashir.

42
00:01:39,783 --> 00:01:41,617
- They left together?
- Mm-hmm.

43
00:01:41,655 --> 00:01:44,253
I think they were
holding... hands.

44
00:01:46,936 --> 00:01:48,303
Oh.

45
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:53,043
Blessed Exchequer,
whose greed is eternal.

46
00:01:53,085 --> 00:01:56,618
Allow this humble bribe
to open your ears

47
00:01:56,661 --> 00:02:00,067
and hear this plea
from your most devout debtor.

48
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:01,733
Continue to bless my bar

49
00:02:01,775 --> 00:02:04,407
with a steady stream
of thirsty customers

50
00:02:04,448 --> 00:02:06,750
whose pockets are lined
with latinum

51
00:02:06,788 --> 00:02:11,665
and whose skills at dabo
are shaky at best...

52
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,699
and while you're at it...

53
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,360
...see if you can do something
about Dr. Bashir.

54
00:02:25,402 --> 00:02:27,532
Don't hurt him or anything.

55
00:02:27,575 --> 00:02:31,073
Just get him off the station
for a couple of months.

56
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:37,459
Oh, and one other thing.

57
00:02:45,187 --> 00:02:49,688
I opened negotiations
with Ezri three months ago

58
00:02:49,732 --> 00:02:52,968
but I can't seem
to close the deal.

59
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,037
Anything you can do to help...

60
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,107
Come in.

61
00:03:10,285 --> 00:03:11,276
Ezri.

62
00:03:18,306 --> 00:03:20,300
Anyone else here?

63
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:22,509
Just you and me.

64
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,680
Is that the bedroom?

65
00:03:24,723 --> 00:03:25,885
I owe you.

66
00:03:25,926 --> 00:03:27,122
Oh!

67
00:03:27,163 --> 00:03:29,066
Does it have to be so rough
the first time?

68
00:03:30,604 --> 00:03:33,544
I don't know what you think is
going on here, but think again.

69
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:36,108
Don't tell me, um...

70
00:03:36,152 --> 00:03:37,952
This is some new
kind of therapy?

71
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,154
Am I supposed to start talking
about my childhood or something?

72
00:03:40,197 --> 00:03:41,564
I hope not.

73
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,235
Good, because I'd
rather talk about us.

74
00:03:45,276 --> 00:03:47,372
Dax... Dax, you're

75
00:03:47,415 --> 00:03:48,816
the most fascinating
woman I've ever met.

76
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:49,879
I love you.

77
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:52,051
There, I said it.

78
00:03:52,127 --> 00:03:53,961
My name's not Dax.

79
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:56,369
Oh, I-I get it.

80
00:03:56,405 --> 00:03:58,775
Your clothes, the knife,
this aggressive attitude...

81
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:00,041
it's all role-playing.

82
00:04:00,082 --> 00:04:01,608
Call me Shmun.

83
00:04:01,652 --> 00:04:02,780
- Shmun?
- Yeah.

84
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:04,952
And I'll call you T'lana...

85
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:08,264
you know, from "Vulcan
Love Slave," Volume III.

86
00:04:08,303 --> 00:04:10,240
You're a very confused man,
aren't you?

87
00:04:13,048 --> 00:04:14,882
If your friend Zek
is depending on you

88
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,016
he's in a lot more trouble
than he thinks.

89
00:04:17,059 --> 00:04:19,759
Zek? What does he have
to do with any of this?

90
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,203
I'll let him explain.

91
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,571
Hello, Quark.

92
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:29,523
It's me, your Grand Nagus.

93
00:04:29,558 --> 00:04:31,826
You'll never guess where I am.

94
00:04:31,863 --> 00:04:33,389
Risa?

95
00:04:33,435 --> 00:04:35,065
If you said Risa, guess again.

96
00:04:35,105 --> 00:04:38,045
I'm in the alternate universe.

97
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,880
You're probably wondering...

98
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:41,718
You're not my Dax.

99
00:04:41,756 --> 00:04:43,123
You're from over there.

100
00:04:43,226 --> 00:04:44,490
You're catching on.

101
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,499
Oh...

102
00:04:45,532 --> 00:04:48,130
You see,
I'm in a bit of trouble.

103
00:04:48,172 --> 00:04:51,544
I'm being held prisoner
by the Alliance

104
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:55,388
and I'm going to need you
to help me regain my freedom.

105
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:58,524
The Regent said
he would send me home

106
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:01,404
in exchange
for a ship's cloaking device.

107
00:05:01,441 --> 00:05:04,472
They don't have them
in this universe.

108
00:05:04,515 --> 00:05:06,611
I wish I'd known that
before I got here.

109
00:05:06,654 --> 00:05:09,719
I could have saved myself
a lot of aggravation

110
00:05:09,762 --> 00:05:12,428
and made a nice profit
at the same time.

111
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:14,064
Oh, well...

112
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:16,602
My fate is in your hands, Quark.

113
00:05:16,647 --> 00:05:20,145
I need a cloaking device
and I need it now.

114
00:05:20,256 --> 00:05:23,162
You're the only one
I can count on.

115
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:27,368
If you do this for me, I promise
I'll be eternally grateful.

116
00:05:27,408 --> 00:05:32,547
And don't forget
to tell your mother I love her.

117
00:05:32,588 --> 00:05:35,390
Good-bye.

118
00:05:35,429 --> 00:05:37,663
He should have gone to Risa.

119
00:05:37,701 --> 00:05:39,729
The Regent wants the cloaking
device in three days.

120
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:41,403
That's not much time.

121
00:05:41,444 --> 00:05:44,418
Cloaking technology isn't
that easy to come by.

122
00:05:44,452 --> 00:05:46,150
You'll find a way.

123
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,682
And if I don't?

124
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:50,097
The Nagus will die.

125
00:05:51,203 --> 00:05:53,367
Oh.

126
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:00,856
Anyone out there?

127
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:01,993
Not that I can see.

128
00:08:02,036 --> 00:08:03,700
Then let's do it.

129
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,273
All right... together now.

130
00:08:07,316 --> 00:08:09,310
Now, lift!

131
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,258
It's heavy.

132
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:12,626
Oh, I noticed.

133
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:15,827
Watch the steps.

134
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,637
I see them, Brother.

135
00:08:21,854 --> 00:08:23,255
I told you, cloaking
the cloaking device

136
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,351
was a good idea.

137
00:08:24,394 --> 00:08:26,160
Brilliant, but couldn't
you have done something

138
00:08:26,265 --> 00:08:27,325
about its weight?

139
00:08:27,368 --> 00:08:29,966
Uh... nope, but if it makes
you feel any better

140
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:32,480
the cloaking device
on the <i>Defiant</i> is a lot heavier.

141
00:08:32,515 --> 00:08:34,315
Tell it to my hernia.

142
00:08:36,325 --> 00:08:38,296
You know what's bothering me?

143
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,358
It seems wrong to be stealing
a cloaking device

144
00:08:40,402 --> 00:08:41,564
for the Alliance.

145
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:43,200
We're not stealing
it for them.

146
00:08:43,276 --> 00:08:45,680
We're stealing it to save Zek.

147
00:08:45,716 --> 00:08:47,346
But what about this other Ezri?

148
00:08:47,386 --> 00:08:48,355
She's a Trill.

149
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:49,380
So?

150
00:08:49,426 --> 00:08:51,192
So, shouldn't she
be with the rebels

151
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,722
fighting against the Alliance?

152
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:55,433
Be sure to point that out
when you meet her.

153
00:08:57,012 --> 00:08:59,746
Just don't forget,
she carries a knife.

154
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,054
Shh.

155
00:09:03,094 --> 00:09:05,190
Someone's coming.

156
00:09:06,403 --> 00:09:08,340
Set it down, quick.

157
00:09:08,374 --> 00:09:09,843
Oh!

158
00:09:11,148 --> 00:09:13,051
Act normal.

159
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:14,887
I'm telling you, Captain

160
00:09:14,924 --> 00:09:17,192
we have to find a way
to expand our lines

161
00:09:17,231 --> 00:09:18,461
beyond the Kalandra system.

162
00:09:18,501 --> 00:09:19,470
I agree.

163
00:09:19,504 --> 00:09:20,564
If we don't move soon

164
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:22,737
the ionic storms
will isolate our position.

165
00:09:22,778 --> 00:09:24,908
And allow the Dominion
to flank us.

166
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:34,942
Is something wrong, gentlemen?

167
00:09:34,976 --> 00:09:36,206
It's the bulkhead.

168
00:09:36,247 --> 00:09:37,273
What about it?

169
00:09:37,349 --> 00:09:39,081
Rom's thinking of painting
his quarters this color.

170
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,454
They're already that color.

171
00:09:40,491 --> 00:09:41,460
I told you.

172
00:09:41,494 --> 00:09:43,693
No wonder I like it.

173
00:09:43,732 --> 00:09:46,638
It's a very soothing
shade of gray.

174
00:09:46,674 --> 00:09:48,508
I'm glad you approve.

175
00:09:48,545 --> 00:09:50,949
Captain...

176
00:09:50,985 --> 00:09:52,045
Hmm?

177
00:09:52,088 --> 00:09:53,318
Carry on.

178
00:09:55,296 --> 00:09:57,290
I'll talk to Admiral Ross.

179
00:09:57,335 --> 00:09:59,705
I'll talk to Chancellor Gowron
as well.

180
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,247
They're headed
for the Klingon ship.

181
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:07,523
What if they discover
the cloaking device is missing?

182
00:10:07,562 --> 00:10:08,588
Let's get out of here.

183
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,469
Where is it?

184
00:10:11,505 --> 00:10:12,531
I'm not sure.

185
00:10:12,575 --> 00:10:14,010
Well, find it.

186
00:10:18,657 --> 00:10:20,525
Ow! Oh!

187
00:10:20,561 --> 00:10:22,225
Good job, Brother.

188
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:24,534
But I wouldn't touch those
induction coils if I were you.

189
00:10:24,572 --> 00:10:25,768
Thanks for the warning.

190
00:10:29,051 --> 00:10:30,520
Up we go.

191
00:10:30,554 --> 00:10:34,519
Come on, Ezri's waiting
for us in Cargo Bay 14.

192
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,801
One Klingon cloaking device
as requested.

193
00:10:53,748 --> 00:10:55,240
As soon as I bring
that to the Regent

194
00:10:55,285 --> 00:10:56,345
he'll release Zek.

195
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:57,914
Then what happens?

196
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,519
Then you get him back.

197
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,299
Would you stop doing that?

198
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:06,712
Doing what?

199
00:11:06,748 --> 00:11:08,308
Staring at me.

200
00:11:08,353 --> 00:11:11,452
Sorry, but you look
just like our Ezri

201
00:11:11,528 --> 00:11:14,559
except you're a lot taller.

202
00:11:14,602 --> 00:11:15,969
What are you talking about?

203
00:11:16,006 --> 00:11:18,034
She's exactly the same height.

204
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:20,572
Uh, I don't think so.

205
00:11:20,617 --> 00:11:22,143
Don't be an idiot.

206
00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:26,063
I'm telling you,
they're identical... I think.

207
00:11:29,575 --> 00:11:31,843
Do I have to throw you
off this transport pad?

208
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,783
One thing's for sure...

209
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,516
their personalities
aren't identical.

210
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:39,157
How do we know the Regent
will keep his word

211
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,794
and send Zek back to us?

212
00:11:40,837 --> 00:11:42,204
You don't.

213
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:44,907
But there's not much
you can do about it, is there?

214
00:11:44,947 --> 00:11:45,973
Yes, there is.

215
00:11:46,017 --> 00:11:47,418
Brother, I think
we should go with her.

216
00:11:47,454 --> 00:11:50,188
I don't think you'll like it
too much on the other side.

217
00:11:50,228 --> 00:11:52,324
That, I believe.

218
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:54,703
But my idiot brother is right.

219
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,709
We're coming with you.

220
00:11:55,742 --> 00:11:57,109
Ferengi!

221
00:11:57,146 --> 00:11:59,675
I'll have you
hanging by your ears.

222
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,191
Well, what are we waiting for?

223
00:12:16,262 --> 00:12:17,356
It didn't work.

224
00:12:17,398 --> 00:12:18,867
Yes, it did.

225
00:12:18,902 --> 00:12:20,462
We're on Terok Nor.

226
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,670
It looks like Deep Space 9
to me.

227
00:12:22,712 --> 00:12:26,176
I suppose a cargo bay
is a cargo bay

228
00:12:26,221 --> 00:12:28,124
no matter what universe
you're in.

229
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,458
But this is
an alternate universe.

230
00:12:29,496 --> 00:12:30,829
Shouldn't everything
be different?

231
00:12:30,866 --> 00:12:32,028
It's different enough.

232
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:33,903
Remember what Captain
Sisko once told us...

233
00:12:33,941 --> 00:12:36,505
in this universe,
we're both dead.

234
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:37,881
That's so sad.

235
00:12:37,918 --> 00:12:39,285
I would have liked
to meet myself.

236
00:12:39,322 --> 00:12:40,723
We better get moving.

237
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,525
I've got a ship waiting for us
on Landing Pad C.

238
00:12:42,563 --> 00:12:43,793
What's the rush?

239
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:44,802
This is a rebel base

240
00:12:44,836 --> 00:12:46,100
and we're working
for the Alliance.

241
00:12:48,846 --> 00:12:49,837
Vic?

242
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:54,623
I thought you two were dead.

243
00:12:55,798 --> 00:12:56,960
We are!

244
00:12:57,001 --> 00:12:58,665
You're not a hologram.

245
00:12:58,739 --> 00:13:00,140
A what?

246
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,788
Throw down your phasers,
Fontaine.

247
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,163
I'll see you in hell first.

248
00:13:15,148 --> 00:13:16,880
I can't believe it.

249
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:20,052
Julian just shot Vic Fontaine.

250
00:13:20,094 --> 00:13:23,034
I thought
Vic was his favorite singer.

251
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:26,704
No wonder they call it
the alternate universe.

252
00:13:32,097 --> 00:13:34,296
You, behind the crates!

253
00:13:34,336 --> 00:13:35,305
You can come out now.

254
00:13:35,338 --> 00:13:38,004
Do as he says.

255
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:44,353
Well, well, well...

256
00:13:44,396 --> 00:13:46,390
Look who we have here.

257
00:13:46,434 --> 00:13:48,770
I'll bet you're
surprised to see us

258
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:49,833
but I can explain.

259
00:13:49,877 --> 00:13:52,817
You worthless
piece of space trash.

260
00:13:53,485 --> 00:13:54,476
Don't hurt her!

261
00:14:00,203 --> 00:14:02,869
Hey, you're supposed
to be the good guys!

262
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,551
My mistake.

263
00:14:09,862 --> 00:14:11,730
I'm sorry, Rom, but that
cloaking device of yours

264
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,499
is now the property of the
Terran Resistance Forces.

265
00:14:13,537 --> 00:14:15,303
But you don't understand.

266
00:14:15,342 --> 00:14:17,108
You have to give us back
the cloaking device.

267
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,740
We need it
to rescue the Nagus.

268
00:14:18,785 --> 00:14:21,087
That's not who you should
be worried about right now.

269
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,289
Do you know what we do
to Alliance sympathizers?

270
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,321
Give it a rest, Julian.

271
00:14:24,366 --> 00:14:25,528
I'll give it a rest

272
00:14:25,569 --> 00:14:27,506
just as soon as these three
get what's coming to them.

273
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,105
I don't know about you,
but I like our Bashir better.

274
00:14:30,148 --> 00:14:31,743
You have to forgive him.

275
00:14:31,786 --> 00:14:33,255
He's had a rough go of it
lately.

276
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,588
He lost a close friend

277
00:14:34,626 --> 00:14:36,654
in a skirmish
with Alliance troops.

278
00:14:36,698 --> 00:14:39,102
This has nothing
to do with Jadzia.

279
00:14:39,137 --> 00:14:40,572
Do you know what
would happen to us

280
00:14:40,608 --> 00:14:42,442
if the Alliance got hold
of a cloaking device?

281
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,642
It wouldn't be pretty.

282
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:45,847
They'd wipe us out
in a matter of weeks.

283
00:14:45,888 --> 00:14:49,830
Besides, there's nothing I
loathe more than traitors.

284
00:14:49,866 --> 00:14:51,392
I'm not a traitor.

285
00:14:51,436 --> 00:14:52,598
She's right.

286
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,841
You have to believe in something
before you can betray it.

287
00:14:55,881 --> 00:14:57,784
I believe in getting paid
for my work

288
00:14:57,819 --> 00:15:00,121
and you still owe me
for the last job I did for you.

289
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,128
We're fighting

290
00:15:01,162 --> 00:15:03,964
for our freedom here...
for our very lives...

291
00:15:04,002 --> 00:15:06,166
and all you care about is money?

292
00:15:06,242 --> 00:15:09,273
Like you said, you have
to have something to believe in.

293
00:15:09,316 --> 00:15:11,788
Let me ram those words
down her throat.

294
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:13,487
You're forgetting something,
Julian.

295
00:15:13,527 --> 00:15:15,623
The Alliance didn't get
the cloaking device... we did

296
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,660
and that gives us the edge...
and we have

297
00:15:17,704 --> 00:15:19,402
these gentlemen
to thank for it.

298
00:15:19,443 --> 00:15:22,383
So what do you want to do...
give them medals?

299
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:23,852
I don't think
their Captain Sisko

300
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:26,017
would be too pleased to
know they were over here

301
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,585
interfering in our affairs.

302
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,692
That's why we didn't tell him.

303
00:15:29,735 --> 00:15:32,230
Huh. Thought as much.

304
00:15:32,342 --> 00:15:35,144
I say we send them back
to where they belong...

305
00:15:35,183 --> 00:15:36,618
let Sisko deal with them.

306
00:15:36,653 --> 00:15:38,487
We can't go back...

307
00:15:38,525 --> 00:15:39,960
not without Zek.

308
00:15:39,996 --> 00:15:41,728
The way I see it,
you've got two choices.

309
00:15:41,766 --> 00:15:44,500
You can either head back
to where you came from

310
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,775
or you can head
for Alliance territory

311
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,807
and try to rescue your friend
without the cloaking device.

312
00:15:48,852 --> 00:15:52,224
You have
till morning to decide.

313
00:15:52,261 --> 00:15:54,232
Either way...

314
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:55,735
you're staying with us.

315
00:16:02,053 --> 00:16:03,785
Tough break.

316
00:16:03,824 --> 00:16:05,259
I'll live.

317
00:16:05,328 --> 00:16:06,854
Are you sure?

318
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:09,531
Don't worry about me.

319
00:16:09,573 --> 00:16:11,772
Smiley's right about one thing...

320
00:16:11,811 --> 00:16:14,147
if you're found
in Alliance territory

321
00:16:14,184 --> 00:16:16,816
without the cloaking device,
you're dead.

322
00:16:16,857 --> 00:16:18,919
Are you suggesting we
should go back home?

323
00:16:18,964 --> 00:16:20,798
It's the smart move.

324
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:25,509
Do we look smart to you?

325
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:37,202
You have such nimble fingers,
my dear.

326
00:16:39,316 --> 00:16:41,982
How many times
have I heard that?

327
00:16:42,024 --> 00:16:44,154
I don't think I could survive

328
00:16:44,195 --> 00:16:46,599
this incarceration
without them.

329
00:16:46,635 --> 00:16:49,803
Oh, I'm glad to be of help.

330
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:53,079
I only wish I could
return the favor.

331
00:16:53,118 --> 00:16:55,386
After all, you've
been suffering here

332
00:16:55,491 --> 00:16:57,394
for a lot longer than I have.

333
00:16:57,463 --> 00:16:59,400
It hasn't been too bad.

334
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,067
I always find a way
of amusing myself

335
00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:04,445
and besides, when your people

336
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,977
give the Regent
the cloaking device

337
00:17:07,022 --> 00:17:08,514
we'll both be free.

338
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,026
If Quark and Rom
don't screw things up.

339
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:19,542
Have a seat, big boy.

340
00:17:22,863 --> 00:17:27,204
You told me your people could
deliver the cloaking device.

341
00:17:27,241 --> 00:17:28,676
You guaranteed it!

342
00:17:28,711 --> 00:17:32,619
Well, so I said,
and so they shall.

343
00:17:34,292 --> 00:17:36,526
Well, then we have
nothing to worry about.

344
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:44,012
Oh... so fragile.

345
00:17:46,925 --> 00:17:48,053
Ah.

346
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:56,038
That's quite a temper
you have, my dear.

347
00:17:56,082 --> 00:17:58,782
Mmm. It's one
of my best features.

348
00:17:58,822 --> 00:18:01,351
Now, where were we?

349
00:18:01,395 --> 00:18:06,842
Mind going back to tugging
at my ear hairs?

350
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,643
Mmm...

351
00:18:08,681 --> 00:18:12,145
your wish is my command.

352
00:18:22,952 --> 00:18:24,478
We have to find
a way out of here.

353
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,025
And then?

354
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,294
And then we get our hands
on the cloaking device

355
00:18:28,332 --> 00:18:29,665
and finish what we started.

356
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,402
All right. Let's say
you manage to save

357
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,938
this Grand Nagus of yours...

358
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:36,043
then what?

359
00:18:36,086 --> 00:18:38,524
Then we go home...

360
00:18:38,626 --> 00:18:40,722
and never come back here again.

361
00:18:40,764 --> 00:18:42,097
That's it?

362
00:18:42,135 --> 00:18:43,434
Isn't it enough?

363
00:18:43,472 --> 00:18:45,466
Quark, don't play dumb with me.

364
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,070
You're risking your life
for him.

365
00:18:47,115 --> 00:18:48,710
There has to be a reason for it.

366
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,848
He's the Nagus,
he's the man my mother loves

367
00:18:50,891 --> 00:18:53,557
not to mention, he's the head
of the Ferengi Alliance.

368
00:18:53,598 --> 00:18:56,264
In other words, he's rich.

369
00:19:00,248 --> 00:19:01,946
They don't come any richer.

370
00:19:01,986 --> 00:19:03,650
I see.

371
00:19:03,691 --> 00:19:05,753
How much are you expecting
to get out of him?

372
00:19:05,796 --> 00:19:07,892
Knowing the Nagus, I'd say...

373
00:19:07,935 --> 00:19:11,433
a pat on the head
and a fistful of empty promises.

374
00:19:11,477 --> 00:19:12,844
I don't understand.

375
00:19:12,882 --> 00:19:14,546
There's nothing to understand.

376
00:19:14,585 --> 00:19:16,522
He's my Nagus...

377
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:18,290
and when your Nagus
gets in trouble

378
00:19:18,328 --> 00:19:20,458
you're supposed
to do something about it.

379
00:19:21,503 --> 00:19:22,665
Why?

380
00:19:22,706 --> 00:19:24,802
I don't know.

381
00:19:24,846 --> 00:19:26,578
Loyalty?

382
00:19:26,651 --> 00:19:27,881
You're kidding me, right?

383
00:19:27,921 --> 00:19:29,447
You're doing this
out of loyalty?

384
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:31,086
Would you stop looking
at me like that?

385
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,598
You're making me feel
like an idiot.

386
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:33,999
I hope so.

387
00:19:34,036 --> 00:19:35,005
Brother...

388
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,534
I just realized something.

389
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:39,573
This should be good.

390
00:19:39,617 --> 00:19:41,451
This is supposed to be
an alternate universe

391
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:45,956
but their Captain O'Brien seems
as nice as our Chief O'Brien.

392
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:47,904
- So?
- Don't you see?

393
00:19:47,939 --> 00:19:49,203
It doesn't make any sense.

394
00:19:49,243 --> 00:19:51,772
It's not "alternate."

395
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,446
Go back to sleep, Rom.

396
00:19:53,487 --> 00:19:56,552
Right...

397
00:19:58,065 --> 00:19:59,899
but it's all very confusing.

398
00:20:02,343 --> 00:20:03,276
What was that?

399
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,387
How would I know?

400
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:10,890
Brother, look out!

401
00:20:10,932 --> 00:20:12,265
It's Brunt!

402
00:20:12,303 --> 00:20:14,935
I don't think it's our Brunt.

403
00:20:14,976 --> 00:20:16,309
What took you so long?

404
00:20:16,346 --> 00:20:18,614
Sorry.
Been a little busy.

405
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:20,384
I had to break
into the cargo bay

406
00:20:20,424 --> 00:20:22,520
steal back the cloaking device
you lost

407
00:20:22,562 --> 00:20:23,929
and get it into our ship.

408
00:20:23,966 --> 00:20:25,492
But on top of that...

409
00:20:25,537 --> 00:20:27,508
Okay, quit your complaining
and get us out of here.

410
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:29,445
I'm... working on it.

411
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,471
Aah...

412
00:20:36,064 --> 00:20:37,694
You two must be hungry.

413
00:20:37,735 --> 00:20:40,071
I've got food and drink
waiting for you on the ship.

414
00:20:43,016 --> 00:20:44,485
He's so nice.

415
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:46,718
Scary, isn't it?

416
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,123
What was that?

417
00:21:00,162 --> 00:21:02,396
Brunt modified
the dilithium matrix

418
00:21:02,434 --> 00:21:03,926
to maximize the output.

419
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,569
He did, did he?

420
00:21:06,611 --> 00:21:08,605
He's a very good engineer.

421
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:10,383
He's also a very good cook.

422
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:13,520
These fried tube grubs
are dee-licious.

423
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,500
Better hope
he didn't poison them.

424
00:21:18,175 --> 00:21:19,735
Mmm...

425
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,081
maybe in our universe,
he'd do something like that...

426
00:21:22,118 --> 00:21:23,485
but not over here.

427
00:21:23,522 --> 00:21:25,994
Over here, everything's...

428
00:21:26,028 --> 00:21:27,554
alternate.

429
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,830
So he's a nice guy.

430
00:21:28,869 --> 00:21:32,709
Which means the tube grubs here
should be poisonous

431
00:21:32,746 --> 00:21:35,275
because they're not
poisonous on our side.

432
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:39,159
But if Brunt gave us poisonous
tube grubs...

433
00:21:39,196 --> 00:21:41,360
it would mean he wasn't as nice
as we think he is

434
00:21:41,402 --> 00:21:42,428
but he has to be nice

435
00:21:42,472 --> 00:21:43,907
because our Brunt isn't.

436
00:21:43,942 --> 00:21:45,309
Rom you're driving me crazy.

437
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,043
It's not me, Brother.
It's this alternate universe.

438
00:21:47,117 --> 00:21:48,211
It just doesn't
make any sense.

439
00:21:48,253 --> 00:21:49,222
More tube grubs?

440
00:21:49,255 --> 00:21:50,747
Yes, please.

441
00:21:50,793 --> 00:21:52,023
No.

442
00:21:52,063 --> 00:21:53,589
Yes!

443
00:21:56,508 --> 00:21:58,240
Oh, no.

444
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:00,273
In case you get hungry.

445
00:22:02,857 --> 00:22:04,885
I put a cup of hot tea
by your bunk.

446
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,958
You should get some rest.

447
00:22:09,342 --> 00:22:11,108
It has been a long day.

448
00:22:12,717 --> 00:22:14,016
You're telling me.

449
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,903
We're not due to rendezvous

450
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:24,071
with the Regent's ship
for another 46 hours.

451
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,651
I'll wake you long before that.

452
00:22:37,247 --> 00:22:41,418
I'd like to see the look
on Bashir's face

453
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:42,859
when he discovers

454
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:45,994
we've stolen back
the cloaking device.

455
00:22:46,036 --> 00:22:48,406
You think he and Smiley
will come after us?

456
00:22:48,443 --> 00:22:50,107
Oh, they can't let the Regent

457
00:22:50,147 --> 00:22:52,084
get his hands
on that technology.

458
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:54,591
Sounds like your sympathies
are with the rebels.

459
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,151
I hate the Alliance.

460
00:22:56,263 --> 00:22:58,565
Then why help them get
the cloaking device?

461
00:22:58,602 --> 00:23:00,596
Ezri and I are partners.

462
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,304
More than that...

463
00:23:02,345 --> 00:23:04,681
she's...

464
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:06,986
the closest friend
I've ever had.

465
00:23:07,024 --> 00:23:09,154
And how close is that?

466
00:23:13,641 --> 00:23:15,635
Not as close as I'd like.

467
00:23:16,984 --> 00:23:17,975
Too bad.

468
00:23:19,256 --> 00:23:20,954
I'm not her type.

469
00:23:20,994 --> 00:23:24,663
And I don't think you are,
either.

470
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,138
What makes you say that?

471
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:29,774
Let's just say that
when it comes to men, she's...

472
00:23:29,816 --> 00:23:31,844
very particular.

473
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,428
Interesting.

474
00:23:48,465 --> 00:23:51,439
My sinuses are clear
for the first time in years.

475
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:54,241
See if this Ferengi has any more
of this... beetle snuff.

476
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,772
Certainly.
But first, my Regent

477
00:23:55,818 --> 00:23:57,755
I must talk to you
about the Intendant.

478
00:23:57,789 --> 00:23:59,419
It's taken us over two years

479
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,728
to track down
that treacherous wench.

480
00:24:01,766 --> 00:24:04,170
We should eliminate her
and be done with it.

481
00:24:04,206 --> 00:24:09,311
I will deal with the Intendant
in my own way and in my own time

482
00:24:09,352 --> 00:24:11,516
but first, I want
that cloaking device!

483
00:24:11,558 --> 00:24:13,392
Yes.

484
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,592
Think of it...

485
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:17,128
with a fleet of cloaked ships

486
00:24:17,173 --> 00:24:20,876
I will be able to crush
the rebellion once and for all!

487
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:25,087
And then, we can
kill the Intendant.

488
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:29,163
We will see.

489
00:24:36,724 --> 00:24:38,695
Big ship.

490
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:40,928
How do we know
we can trust the Regent?

491
00:24:40,968 --> 00:24:42,768
Once he has the cloaking device

492
00:24:42,806 --> 00:24:45,712
there's nothing to stop
him from killing us all.

493
00:24:45,747 --> 00:24:48,687
It's a little late
to back out now, Quark.

494
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:50,521
By bringing him
the cloaking device

495
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,119
you've proven yourself useful.

496
00:24:52,164 --> 00:24:53,565
Believe me

497
00:24:53,601 --> 00:24:56,473
the Regent never gets rid
of anyone he finds useful.

498
00:24:59,382 --> 00:25:01,353
I hope you're right.

499
00:25:01,387 --> 00:25:02,982
Me, too.

500
00:25:10,043 --> 00:25:12,811
You... come here.

501
00:25:12,851 --> 00:25:14,115
Your Regent needs you.

502
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:24,980
Nice fit.

503
00:25:27,522 --> 00:25:30,360
Our visitors from the other
universe have arrived

504
00:25:30,463 --> 00:25:31,830
and I'm happy to report

505
00:25:31,867 --> 00:25:33,804
they have not come
empty-handed.

506
00:25:42,026 --> 00:25:43,621
Look who the Regent is.

507
00:25:43,664 --> 00:25:45,031
So?

508
00:25:45,067 --> 00:25:47,539
So who's president
of the Federation? Gul Dukat?

509
00:25:47,574 --> 00:25:49,272
They don't have
a Federation here.

510
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,215
Is there a problem,
Ferengi?

511
00:25:54,158 --> 00:25:56,186
Just ignore him.

512
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:58,292
Now...

513
00:25:58,335 --> 00:26:00,705
if you'll give us the Nagus,
we'll be on our way

514
00:26:00,741 --> 00:26:04,045
and you can go on with your
plans for mass destruction

515
00:26:04,084 --> 00:26:07,058
genocide and all those
other good things.

516
00:26:07,091 --> 00:26:10,122
Victory is finally
within my grasp.

517
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:12,900
I want this operational
within the hour.

518
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,108
And it will be so, Exalted One.

519
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:20,187
We have a deal, right?

520
00:26:20,225 --> 00:26:21,991
Do we?

521
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,260
Tell him.

522
00:26:24,971 --> 00:26:26,942
Yes, my dear...

523
00:26:26,976 --> 00:26:29,448
why don't you tell him?

524
00:26:36,668 --> 00:26:39,300
I knew you wouldn't
disappoint me.

525
00:26:45,023 --> 00:26:47,119
Uh-oh.

526
00:26:47,162 --> 00:26:50,102
You're not going to give
us the Nagus, are you?

527
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,248
You...

528
00:26:56,286 --> 00:26:59,088
you knew about this all along.

529
00:26:59,126 --> 00:27:00,756
What can I say?

530
00:27:00,797 --> 00:27:02,461
I'm loyal to my friends.

531
00:27:02,502 --> 00:27:05,567
Isn't she just the best?

532
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:07,946
I don't understand...
you're letting her go?

533
00:27:07,983 --> 00:27:09,384
She earned it.

534
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,417
Having them bring us the
cloaking device was her idea.

535
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:15,498
Get rid of these two.

536
00:27:15,536 --> 00:27:18,100
Is that really necessary?
They could come in handy.

537
00:27:18,143 --> 00:27:20,171
If the Regent
wants your opinion

538
00:27:20,214 --> 00:27:21,513
he'll ask for it.

539
00:27:22,955 --> 00:27:25,017
Do not kill them just yet.

540
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,427
But Your Magnificence...

541
00:27:26,464 --> 00:27:27,295
You heard me!

542
00:27:29,037 --> 00:27:31,373
Lock them up.

543
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,678
Let's go.

544
00:27:33,716 --> 00:27:36,382
I hope you two are
very happy together.

545
00:27:36,423 --> 00:27:38,360
We will be.

546
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:54,508
Our Ezri would never betray us,
which means...

547
00:27:54,553 --> 00:27:55,954
Oh, don't start
with that again.

548
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,893
Right...

549
00:27:57,928 --> 00:28:00,662
Rom, you're not going
to tell your mother

550
00:28:00,703 --> 00:28:03,141
about the Intendant
and me, are you?

551
00:28:03,176 --> 00:28:04,840
It would break her heart.

552
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,817
In a million pieces.

553
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:09,416
You see, she worships me...

554
00:28:09,459 --> 00:28:11,897
and I worship her right back.

555
00:28:11,932 --> 00:28:14,496
Besides, this is all your fault.

556
00:28:14,538 --> 00:28:16,737
If it weren't for you,
I never would have

557
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,749
been able
to get to this universe.

558
00:28:18,783 --> 00:28:21,483
You remember the last time
you came home

559
00:28:21,523 --> 00:28:22,856
to visit your mother?

560
00:28:22,893 --> 00:28:23,862
Well, one night

561
00:28:23,896 --> 00:28:26,768
while you were sleeping,
I got up to get

562
00:28:26,837 --> 00:28:28,272
a bite to eat.

563
00:28:28,308 --> 00:28:29,777
And there

564
00:28:29,878 --> 00:28:34,379
on the kitchen table,
was a Starfleet padd.

565
00:28:35,392 --> 00:28:37,990
My... engineering notebook?

566
00:28:39,637 --> 00:28:42,235
With the schematics
for the multidimensional

567
00:28:42,277 --> 00:28:44,977
transporter that Chief O'Brien
gave me to study.

568
00:28:45,018 --> 00:28:46,317
You stole it!

569
00:28:46,355 --> 00:28:47,950
I'm your Nagus.

570
00:28:47,991 --> 00:28:50,829
You have no secrets from me.

571
00:28:50,933 --> 00:28:52,699
I still don't understand

572
00:28:52,738 --> 00:28:55,940
why you'd want to come here
in the first place.

573
00:28:55,979 --> 00:28:57,243
Simple, really.

574
00:28:57,282 --> 00:29:00,154
I came to find new
financial opportunities

575
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,785
for the Ferengi people.

576
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:04,197
In the alternate universe?!

577
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:09,569
Well... it seemed like
a good idea at the time.

578
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:12,179
Right now,
it would be a good idea

579
00:29:12,221 --> 00:29:15,127
for us to find a way
out of here.

580
00:29:17,034 --> 00:29:19,472
I just don't feel right
about this.

581
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,239
Quark and Rom deserve better.

582
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,011
Forget about them, all right?

583
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:24,952
That's just it...
I can't.

584
00:29:24,987 --> 00:29:26,547
I like them...

585
00:29:26,592 --> 00:29:28,118
and so do you.

586
00:29:28,163 --> 00:29:30,465
Don't tell me who I like.

587
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:33,874
Talk to the Intendant...
she listens to you.

588
00:29:33,978 --> 00:29:35,846
Tell her the Ferengi
kept their part of the bargain.

589
00:29:35,883 --> 00:29:37,147
We should do the same.

590
00:29:37,186 --> 00:29:38,884
What a novel idea.

591
00:29:38,991 --> 00:29:42,626
Now, I can't remember
the last time I kept my word.

592
00:29:42,667 --> 00:29:44,729
Maybe now's a good time
to start.

593
00:29:44,772 --> 00:29:46,241
Forget it, Brunt.

594
00:29:46,276 --> 00:29:48,270
No, not this time.

595
00:29:48,315 --> 00:29:49,750
That's all right.

596
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:53,256
Let him talk, my dear.

597
00:29:53,295 --> 00:29:57,260
He obviously feels
very passionately about this

598
00:29:57,305 --> 00:29:59,777
and you know how responsive
I am to passion.

599
00:29:59,811 --> 00:30:01,178
Go on.

600
00:30:01,215 --> 00:30:03,949
What do we gain
from their death?

601
00:30:04,023 --> 00:30:05,515
Nothing.

602
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,828
On the other hand,
if we let them live

603
00:30:07,866 --> 00:30:10,464
they may come in handy.

604
00:30:10,506 --> 00:30:12,443
I never thought of that.

605
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,448
The Regent will
give them to you.

606
00:30:14,483 --> 00:30:16,751
All you have to do is ask.

607
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:18,589
Maybe...

608
00:30:18,627 --> 00:30:21,395
but why waste a favor on
those two little trolls?

609
00:30:21,435 --> 00:30:22,404
No, I'm afraid

610
00:30:22,437 --> 00:30:24,465
I don't much care
for your suggestion

611
00:30:24,509 --> 00:30:26,913
and as a matter of fact...

612
00:30:26,948 --> 00:30:29,318
I don't much like you, either.

613
00:30:31,461 --> 00:30:32,828
No!

614
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,393
He was going to betray me.

615
00:30:35,437 --> 00:30:37,067
I could see it in his eyes.

616
00:30:39,481 --> 00:30:41,680
You wouldn't do that
to me, would you?

617
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,588
Would you?!

618
00:30:45,397 --> 00:30:48,998
Oh... oh, oh, oh, no.

619
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,912
No. No, of course
you wouldn't.

620
00:30:55,891 --> 00:30:57,019
I...

621
00:30:57,061 --> 00:31:01,003
I've suffered so many
disappointments in my life...

622
00:31:01,037 --> 00:31:04,273
Brunt... Sisko, Bareil...

623
00:31:04,312 --> 00:31:06,374
the list goes on and on.

624
00:31:07,554 --> 00:31:09,218
Dispose of that, would you?

625
00:31:09,258 --> 00:31:10,318
It depresses me.

626
00:31:12,868 --> 00:31:14,167
It's your mess.

627
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,640
You clean it up.

628
00:31:21,657 --> 00:31:25,292
She's not afraid of anyone,
is she?

629
00:31:25,334 --> 00:31:27,032
Not even me.

630
00:31:29,377 --> 00:31:34,048
Regent, long-range sensors
have detected an enemy ship.

631
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,720
It's the <i>Defiant.</i>

632
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,956
Excellent!

633
00:31:36,997 --> 00:31:39,127
It is time to test
the cloaking device.

634
00:31:39,203 --> 00:31:42,541
Um, I'm afraid
it's not yet operational.

635
00:31:45,018 --> 00:31:46,682
And why is that?

636
00:31:46,722 --> 00:31:50,528
Well, it's a very complicated
piece of equipment.

637
00:31:50,566 --> 00:31:53,404
One of the Ferengi seemed to
know how it worked.

638
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,035
Then why is he not here?

639
00:31:55,077 --> 00:31:57,071
I'll get him.

640
00:32:01,126 --> 00:32:03,120
Getting the cloaking device
on line?

641
00:32:03,198 --> 00:32:04,258
That's simple.

642
00:32:04,301 --> 00:32:05,292
Good.

643
00:32:05,338 --> 00:32:06,807
Lower the force field.

644
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,242
Hold on a second.

645
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:10,044
Why should we help the Regent?

646
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:11,713
Or you, for that matter?

647
00:32:11,754 --> 00:32:14,887
I'm trying to save your lives.

648
00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:17,367
That's a very worthy goal!

649
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:20,136
Since when do you care
about what happens to us?

650
00:32:20,175 --> 00:32:21,439
All right, forget it.

651
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:23,005
I don't want to forget it.

652
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,542
I'm sorry, Brother.

653
00:32:24,587 --> 00:32:27,789
Maybe you want to die in this
crazy, mixed-up universe

654
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:28,957
but I don't.

655
00:32:28,998 --> 00:32:30,662
Neither do I!

656
00:32:30,703 --> 00:32:33,039
Lower the force field.

657
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:40,350
I suppose we have
nothing to lose.

658
00:32:40,395 --> 00:32:42,867
Where do you think
you're going?

659
00:32:42,902 --> 00:32:44,873
With him... he needs my help.

660
00:32:44,907 --> 00:32:46,537
You're a bartender, Quark.

661
00:32:46,577 --> 00:32:48,514
What are you going to do,
mix him a drink?

662
00:32:51,223 --> 00:32:53,091
Don't worry, Brother.

663
00:32:53,128 --> 00:32:54,529
I'm not thirsty.

664
00:32:54,565 --> 00:32:57,265
I don't expect you
to believe this

665
00:32:57,339 --> 00:32:59,037
but I am trying to help you.

666
00:33:01,416 --> 00:33:02,885
You're right!

667
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,154
I don't believe you.

668
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:07,687
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

669
00:33:07,732 --> 00:33:09,201
Isodine coupler.

670
00:33:12,144 --> 00:33:15,984
Does this look like
an isodine coupler to you?

671
00:33:16,021 --> 00:33:18,255
I don't see how anything
gets fixed around here!

672
00:33:18,293 --> 00:33:19,262
I'd advise you

673
00:33:19,296 --> 00:33:21,894
to watch your tone
of voice, Ferengi!

674
00:33:21,936 --> 00:33:24,272
Or what?

675
00:33:24,376 --> 00:33:27,373
You won't let me install
the cloaking device?!

676
00:33:28,987 --> 00:33:33,226
I'm... sorry if I've upset you.

677
00:33:33,265 --> 00:33:38,438
Now, will you please
get back to work?

678
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,781
Don't mind if I do.

679
00:33:45,631 --> 00:33:47,295
Oh.

680
00:33:47,336 --> 00:33:49,000
Really?

681
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,269
Absolutely.

682
00:33:50,309 --> 00:33:52,041
I have never tried that before.

683
00:33:52,081 --> 00:33:55,419
Few man have, but I think
you'll find it very stimulating.

684
00:33:58,832 --> 00:34:01,202
What do you expect in return?

685
00:34:01,238 --> 00:34:03,175
Terok Nor, of course.

686
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:06,275
I was planning on
destroying that station.

687
00:34:06,318 --> 00:34:08,118
Plans can be changed.

688
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,794
I will consider it.

689
00:34:11,832 --> 00:34:13,894
What more can I ask?

690
00:34:13,938 --> 00:34:15,568
Uh...

691
00:34:15,609 --> 00:34:17,341
Mr. Regent...

692
00:34:17,414 --> 00:34:19,351
What is it?

693
00:34:19,452 --> 00:34:20,751
Your cloak is ready.

694
00:34:20,789 --> 00:34:21,758
Ah.

695
00:34:21,792 --> 00:34:23,888
I'll take over from here.

696
00:34:35,761 --> 00:34:37,230
It's working.

697
00:34:37,265 --> 00:34:38,632
Well done.

698
00:34:38,669 --> 00:34:41,369
You mean, no one can see us?

699
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:43,471
How deliciously deceitful.

700
00:34:45,887 --> 00:34:47,517
Are you certain
you know how to operate

701
00:34:47,558 --> 00:34:48,527
the device?

702
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,998
Well, what I don't know,
I always can learn.

703
00:34:51,034 --> 00:34:54,440
It's pretty simple
once you understand the basics.

704
00:34:54,476 --> 00:34:58,350
Now... what about my brother
and the Nagus?

705
00:34:58,386 --> 00:35:01,120
Do we have
any further use for them?

706
00:35:02,063 --> 00:35:03,623
Not that I can think of.

707
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:05,296
Then get rid of them.

708
00:35:05,338 --> 00:35:07,833
You mean, we're going home?

709
00:35:07,877 --> 00:35:09,073
No.

710
00:35:09,114 --> 00:35:11,416
He means you're going to die.

711
00:35:11,454 --> 00:35:13,186
That settles it!

712
00:35:13,225 --> 00:35:16,165
I'm never helping you again!

713
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,760
Or anyone else,
for that matter.

714
00:35:17,803 --> 00:35:19,102
Come along, now.

715
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,137
I'm really beginning
to hate this universe.

716
00:35:27,496 --> 00:35:29,626
What we have here, gentlemen

717
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:34,202
is 10cc's of concentrated
Ulcartic virus.

718
00:35:34,246 --> 00:35:40,091
It's very deadly
and quite painful.

719
00:35:40,128 --> 00:35:42,327
It elevates the temperature
of your body

720
00:35:42,367 --> 00:35:46,936
heating your internal organs
until they literally boil.

721
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:51,514
I was hoping to use this
on the Intendant, but I suppose

722
00:35:51,558 --> 00:35:54,532
I'll have to settle
for the for the four of you.

723
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:56,125
Now...

724
00:35:56,169 --> 00:35:59,166
who would like to go first?

725
00:36:06,635 --> 00:36:08,572
I'm waiting.

726
00:36:09,609 --> 00:36:10,578
Why don't you give us

727
00:36:10,611 --> 00:36:11,705
a couple of days
to think it over

728
00:36:11,781 --> 00:36:13,445
and we'll get back to you.

729
00:36:13,486 --> 00:36:15,457
All right, then, I'll pick.

730
00:36:15,491 --> 00:36:16,517
Let's see...

731
00:36:16,561 --> 00:36:18,030
What an amateur.

732
00:36:18,064 --> 00:36:19,260
Excuse me?

733
00:36:19,301 --> 00:36:21,603
I mean, compared to our Garak.

734
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,580
Now that man knows how
to conduct an interrogation.

735
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:26,381
I'm not interrogating anyone.

736
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,753
Why not?

737
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:30,524
Did it ever occur to you
that we may know things

738
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:33,401
that you could use
to your advantage?

739
00:36:33,438 --> 00:36:34,235
Like what?

740
00:36:34,273 --> 00:36:35,674
We're not going to tell you...

741
00:36:35,711 --> 00:36:37,910
not unless you interrogate us.

742
00:36:37,949 --> 00:36:39,316
I don't have time for this.

743
00:36:39,353 --> 00:36:42,954
I want to be on the Bridge
when we destroy the <i>Defiant.</i>

744
00:36:42,996 --> 00:36:49,241
In our universe,
work comes before pleasure.

745
00:36:49,279 --> 00:36:50,270
Our Garak

746
00:36:50,315 --> 00:36:52,617
would have us hanging
by our toenails by now

747
00:36:52,655 --> 00:36:54,991
telling him all our secrets.

748
00:36:55,027 --> 00:36:55,996
What secrets?

749
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,226
That's for us to know

750
00:36:57,266 --> 00:36:58,758
and you to find out.

751
00:36:58,803 --> 00:37:03,680
If you were smart,
you'd cross over to our universe

752
00:37:03,716 --> 00:37:05,550
and get some pointers
from our Garak.

753
00:37:05,588 --> 00:37:09,325
When it comes to torture
assassination and sabotage

754
00:37:09,364 --> 00:37:11,392
you could learn
a lot from him.

755
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:14,707
I know all there is
to know about sabotage.

756
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,384
That's not what we hear.

757
00:37:26,241 --> 00:37:27,335
Something's wrong.

758
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,076
We should have caught
that Ferengi ship long ago.

759
00:37:29,116 --> 00:37:30,142
We'll find them.

760
00:37:30,185 --> 00:37:31,279
For all we know

761
00:37:31,321 --> 00:37:33,485
the Regent may already
have the cloaking device.

762
00:37:33,527 --> 00:37:35,863
In fact, he might have us
in his sights right now

763
00:37:35,967 --> 00:37:37,368
and we wouldn't even know it.

764
00:37:37,404 --> 00:37:39,638
Don't start getting
paranoid, Smiley.

765
00:37:39,677 --> 00:37:41,841
Even if the Regent
has the cloaking device

766
00:37:41,882 --> 00:37:43,853
chances are,
it isn't functional yet.

767
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,447
I hope you're right.

768
00:38:04,808 --> 00:38:08,214
They have no idea
that we are behind them.

769
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:11,691
There's nothing I enjoy
better than a good ambush.

770
00:38:13,063 --> 00:38:14,362
It is time.

771
00:38:23,424 --> 00:38:24,552
I don't understand.

772
00:38:24,592 --> 00:38:27,862
Is this Garak of yours
an assassin or a tailor?

773
00:38:27,902 --> 00:38:29,064
- An assassin.
- Both.

774
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:31,406
Never mind.

775
00:38:31,444 --> 00:38:33,381
I have to be back on the Bridge.

776
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:34,578
Now...

777
00:38:34,618 --> 00:38:36,350
who's first?

778
00:38:36,423 --> 00:38:37,619
Drop the cloak!

779
00:38:47,887 --> 00:38:49,915
I hate it when you're right.

780
00:38:49,959 --> 00:38:51,827
Evasive action... now!

781
00:38:51,864 --> 00:38:52,958
Fire!

782
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,974
What was that?

783
00:38:58,013 --> 00:38:59,677
Sabotage... what else?

784
00:39:02,023 --> 00:39:04,153
We've experienced
primary system failure.

785
00:39:04,196 --> 00:39:05,495
That Ferengi, he did this!

786
00:39:05,533 --> 00:39:08,062
I'm unable
to get anything back on line.

787
00:39:12,284 --> 00:39:15,782
You taught me something
about sabotage, and now

788
00:39:15,825 --> 00:39:17,853
I'm going to teach you
something about pain.

789
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:30,160
How much is this
going to cost us?

790
00:39:30,196 --> 00:39:32,395
I'm not doing this for money.

791
00:39:33,906 --> 00:39:35,102
Then why?

792
00:39:36,814 --> 00:39:38,876
Do you want to get out
of here or not?

793
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:40,753
Of course we do.

794
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:43,262
Then stop asking questions
and let's go.

795
00:39:49,647 --> 00:39:51,082
They're not coming after us.

796
00:39:51,151 --> 00:39:52,245
Why not?

797
00:39:52,288 --> 00:39:53,314
They can't.

798
00:39:53,356 --> 00:39:55,658
Their power grid's off-line.

799
00:39:58,102 --> 00:39:59,071
Then what do you say

800
00:39:59,104 --> 00:40:00,403
we give the Regent
a proper greeting?

801
00:40:00,442 --> 00:40:01,809
Reversing course.

802
00:40:12,005 --> 00:40:13,338
We must raise shields!

803
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:14,366
We can't!

804
00:40:16,116 --> 00:40:19,181
I don't know how much more of
this the hull can withstand.

805
00:40:21,964 --> 00:40:24,493
Captain O'Brien would like
to have a word with you.

806
00:40:28,013 --> 00:40:30,508
That's a nice ship you have,
Regent.

807
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,183
I'd hate to see it destroyed.

808
00:40:32,224 --> 00:40:34,218
But, of course,
if you insist...

809
00:40:39,911 --> 00:40:41,541
What are your terms?

810
00:40:41,581 --> 00:40:45,148
Ooh, a simple
unconditional surrender

811
00:40:45,191 --> 00:40:46,217
should do the trick.

812
00:40:46,294 --> 00:40:48,766
I'm afraid
you've run out of options.

813
00:40:53,145 --> 00:40:54,945
Victory is yours.

814
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,614
Prepare to be boarded.

815
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:02,032
I have been betrayed.

816
00:41:02,068 --> 00:41:04,563
I knew I should have killed
those two Ferengi

817
00:41:04,608 --> 00:41:06,978
the moment they came aboard.

818
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:25,258
What a surprise.

819
00:41:25,295 --> 00:41:27,391
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

820
00:41:27,434 --> 00:41:29,268
Here I am.

821
00:41:30,475 --> 00:41:32,446
Is that really necessary?

822
00:41:32,481 --> 00:41:35,717
I was about to ask you
the same question.

823
00:41:45,247 --> 00:41:46,216
Ah.

824
00:41:47,252 --> 00:41:49,314
That's better.

825
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:52,491
You and I have to get
to one of the escape shuttles.

826
00:41:52,533 --> 00:41:53,797
You go.

827
00:41:53,836 --> 00:41:55,328
I'm staying here.

828
00:41:55,373 --> 00:41:56,933
You can't be serious.

829
00:41:56,978 --> 00:41:58,812
You shouldn't
have killed Brunt.

830
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,583
Isn't it a little late
to be developing a conscience?

831
00:42:01,623 --> 00:42:03,149
I hope not.

832
00:42:08,574 --> 00:42:09,543
Brunt's dead?

833
00:42:09,577 --> 00:42:10,841
Sorry...

834
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,440
wrong Brunt.

835
00:42:12,485 --> 00:42:14,684
We're not going to let
her get away, are we?

836
00:42:14,723 --> 00:42:17,025
I owe her that much.

837
00:42:17,063 --> 00:42:19,901
Oh, let her go.

838
00:42:19,936 --> 00:42:22,876
There's something
about that woman

839
00:42:22,911 --> 00:42:24,711
I find intoxicating.

840
00:42:43,298 --> 00:42:45,269
Glad to be going home?

841
00:42:45,303 --> 00:42:47,069
You bet I am.

842
00:42:47,108 --> 00:42:49,842
That doesn't mean
I won't be coming back.

843
00:42:49,881 --> 00:42:51,784
Here?
What for?

844
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,884
There's a fortune to be made
in the alternate universe.

845
00:42:54,927 --> 00:42:56,795
I can feel it in my lobes.

846
00:42:56,832 --> 00:42:59,634
Well, don't expect us
to come chasing after you again.

847
00:42:59,673 --> 00:43:02,077
Oh, no, I won't.

848
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:05,349
Next time, I'll bring you
along with me.

849
00:43:05,388 --> 00:43:08,260
In that case,
I won't bother saying good-bye.

850
00:43:08,296 --> 00:43:10,358
You know...

851
00:43:10,401 --> 00:43:13,569
coming back here
isn't such a bad idea...

852
00:43:13,609 --> 00:43:17,142
if I knew I could see you again.

853
00:43:17,186 --> 00:43:19,350
I'm not going anywhere.

854
00:43:20,594 --> 00:43:23,192
I could stick around
a couple of days.

855
00:43:23,235 --> 00:43:25,035
You could show me the station.

856
00:43:25,072 --> 00:43:27,567
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

857
00:43:27,613 --> 00:43:31,818
I could help you work
on that conscience of yours.

858
00:43:31,857 --> 00:43:34,056
I think I can take it from here.

859
00:43:34,096 --> 00:43:35,999
Excuse me.

860
00:43:36,034 --> 00:43:37,162
Leeta?

861
00:43:39,009 --> 00:43:40,410
Do I know you?

862
00:43:40,446 --> 00:43:42,714
We're married!

863
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:46,223
I don't think so.

864
00:43:46,261 --> 00:43:48,893
You're Ezri, right?

865
00:43:48,935 --> 00:43:52,741
Captain Smiley wants
me to debrief you.

866
00:43:52,778 --> 00:43:55,148
Must be my lucky day.

867
00:43:58,326 --> 00:44:02,234
This is quite
a fascinating place

868
00:44:02,269 --> 00:44:04,263
don't you agree?

869
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,675
I want to go home.

870
00:44:07,951 --> 00:44:09,352
Me, too.
