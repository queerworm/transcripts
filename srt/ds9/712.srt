1
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:12,805
Have you ever seen anything
so disgusting?

2
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:16,892
The way he's undressing her
with his eyes.

3
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,894
And look at his hands!

4
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,813
What about his hands?

5
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:22,690
His gestures--
they're obscene.

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,732
You should arrest him.

7
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,108
You're joking.

8
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,652
He's pitiful.

9
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,364
Doesn't he realize she loves me?

10
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,073
I don't think he does.

11
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,994
To be honest,
I don't think she does, either.

12
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:36,871
Thanks for your support.

13
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,664
Brother,
I just talked to Moogie.

14
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,082
She says Grand Nagus Zek
has disappeared.

15
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:43,210
What do you mean, disappeared?

16
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,004
He left her a note
saying he was going

17
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:46,839
on a business safari
to open new territories

18
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:48,716
for financial
exploitation.
That's our Nagus.

19
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:50,759
He said he'd be back
in five days.

20
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,260
That was 12 days ago.

21
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,721
Twelve?

22
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,430
Has he done this before?

23
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,682
Not for this long.

24
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:57,808
Moogie did some checking.

25
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:59,142
No one's heard from him.

26
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,394
He could be hurt
or even dead.

27
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,729
We have to do something!

28
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,814
He probably stopped
off on Risa

29
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,734
you know, for a little rest
and relaxation.

30
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,861
Risa? With all those
gorgeous women?

31
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,988
He wouldn't
do that to Moogie.

32
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,742
Have you looked
at our mother lately?

33
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,577
She's not getting
any younger.

34
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,412
Now, do us both a favor

35
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,873
and stop worrying about Zek.

36
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:22,290
He'll show up.

37
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,125
Are you sure?

38
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,210
Good-bye, Rom.

39
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,170
Good-bye.

40
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,054
Where'd Ezri go?

41
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:38,766
Oh, uh, she slipped out the back
with Bashir.

42
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,726
They left together?
Mm-hmm.

43
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:43,311
I think they were
holding... hands.

44
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,400
Oh.

45
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,071
Blessed Exchequer,
whose greed is eternal.

46
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:55,783
Allow this humble bribe
to open your ears

47
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:59,160
and hear this plea
from your most devout debtor.

48
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,746
Continue to bless my bar

49
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:03,582
with a steady stream
of thirsty customers

50
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,751
whose pockets are lined
with latinum

51
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:10,798
and whose skills at dabo
are shaky at best...

52
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:14,885
and while you're at it...

53
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:24,478
...see if you can do something
about Dr. Bashir.

54
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,688
Don't hurt him or anything.

55
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,150
Just get him off the station
for a couple of months.

56
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,401
(<i> chuckles</i> )

57
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:36,531
Oh, and one other thing.

58
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:48,794
I opened negotiations
with Ezri three months ago

59
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:52,006
but I can't seem
to close the deal.

60
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:55,050
Anything you can do to help...

61
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,217
(<i> door chimes</i> )

62
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,474
(<i> door chimes</i> )

63
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,477
(<i> door chimes</i> )

64
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,062
Come in.

65
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:10,273
Ezri.

66
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:15,988
(<i> squeals in pain</i> )

67
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,407
Anyone else here?

68
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,451
Just you and me.

69
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,536
(<i> groans</i> )

70
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,620
Is that
the bedroom?

71
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,705
I owe you.

72
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,414
Oh!

73
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,875
Does it have
to be so rough
the first time?

74
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,793
(<i> gasps</i> )

75
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,379
I don't know what you think is
going on here, but think again.

76
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,882
Don't tell me, um...

77
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:36,925
This is some new
kind of therapy?

78
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,969
Am I supposed to start talking
about my childhood or something?

79
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,512
I hope not.

80
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:44,016
Good, because I'd
rather talk about us.

81
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:46,143
Dax... Dax, you're

82
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,728
the most fascinating
woman I've ever met.

83
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,729
I love you.

84
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,939
There, I said it.

85
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,858
My name's not Dax.

86
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,235
Oh, I-I get it.

87
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,738
Your clothes, the knife,
this aggressive attitude--

88
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:58,906
it's all role-playing.

89
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,574
Call me Shmun.

90
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,825
Shmun?
Yeah.

91
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,827
And I'll call you T'lana--

92
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:07,039
you know, from "Vulcan
Love Slave," Volume III.

93
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,083
You're a very confused man,
aren't you?

94
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,754
If your friend Zek
is depending on you

95
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,797
he's in a lot more trouble
than he thinks.

96
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,800
Zek? What does he have
to do with any of this?

97
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,011
I'll let him explain.

98
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,348
Hello, Quark.

99
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,268
It's me, your Grand Nagus.

100
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,729
You'll never guess where I am.

101
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,147
Risa?

102
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,774
If you said Risa, guess again.

103
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,735
I'm in the alternate universe.

104
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,737
You're probably wondering...

105
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,572
You're not my Dax.

106
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,949
You're from over there.

107
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,366
You're catching on.

108
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,576
Oh...

109
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,828
You see,
I'm in a bit of trouble.

110
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:50,249
I'm being held prisoner
by the Alliance

111
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:54,128
and I'm going to need you
to help me regain my freedom.

112
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:57,214
The Regent said
he would send me home

113
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,175
in exchange
for a ship's cloaking device.

114
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,053
They don't have them
in this universe.

115
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,264
I wish I'd known that
before I got here.

116
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:08,433
I could have saved myself
a lot of aggravation

117
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,103
and made a nice profit
at the same time.

118
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,687
Oh, well...

119
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,274
My fate is in your hands, Quark.

120
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:18,735
I need a cloaking device
and I need it<i> now.</i>

121
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,655
You're the only one
I can count on.

122
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:25,867
If you do this for me, I promise
I'll be eternally grateful.

123
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:31,206
And don't forget
to tell your mother I love her.

124
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,917
Good-bye.

125
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,335
He should have
gone to Risa.

126
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,379
The Regent wants the cloaking
device in three days.

127
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,174
That's not much time.

128
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,968
Cloaking technology isn't
that easy to come by.

129
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,803
You'll find a way.

130
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,345
And if I don't?

131
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:49,599
The Nagus will die.

132
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,852
(<i> sighing</i> ):
Oh.

133
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,688
ROM:
Anyone out there?

134
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:01,898
Not that I can see.

135
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,524
Then let's do it.

136
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:07,237
QUARK:
All right-- together now.

137
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,239
(<i> straining</i> ):
Now, lift!

138
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,158
ROM:
It's heavy.

139
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,367
QUARK:
Oh, I noticed.

140
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,703
Watch the steps.

141
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,289
I see them, Brother.

142
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:22,961
I told you, cloaking
the cloaking device

143
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,712
was a good idea.

144
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:25,880
Brilliant, but couldn't
you have done something

145
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,632
about its weight?

146
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,592
Uh... nope, but if it makes
you feel any better

147
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,012
the cloaking device
on the<i> Defiant</i> is a lot heavier.

148
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,847
Tell it to my hernia.

149
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,892
You know what's bothering me?

150
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,020
It seems wrong to be stealing
a cloaking device

151
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,438
for the Alliance.

152
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,981
We're not stealing
it for them.

153
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,192
We're stealing
it to save Zek.

154
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,985
But what about
this other Ezri?

155
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,028
She's a Trill.

156
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,446
So?

157
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,905
So, shouldn't she
be with the rebels

158
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,699
fighting<i> against</i>
the Alliance?

159
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,951
Be sure to point that
out when you meet her.

160
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:59,080
Just don't forget,
she carries a knife.

161
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,501
Shh.

162
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,544
Someone's coming.

163
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,881
Set it down, quick.

164
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,216
Oh!

165
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:10,550
(<i> voices approaching</i> )

166
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,469
Act normal.

167
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,304
I'm telling you,
Captain

168
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,556
we have to find a way
to expand our lines

169
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,807
beyond the Kalandra system.

170
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,850
SISKO:
I agree.

171
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,477
If we don't move soon

172
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,978
the ionic storms
will isolate our position.

173
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,022
And allow the Dominion
to flank us.

174
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,032
Is something wrong, gentlemen?

175
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,367
It's the bulkhead.

176
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,077
What about it?

177
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,453
Rom's thinking of painting
his quarters this color.

178
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:39,704
They're already
that color.

179
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:40,788
I told you.

180
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,582
No wonder I like it.

181
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,793
It's a very soothing
shade of gray.

182
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,879
I'm glad you approve.

183
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,215
Captain...

184
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,341
Hmm?

185
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,551
Carry on.

186
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,513
SISKO:
I'll talk to Admiral Ross.

187
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,932
MARTOK:
I'll talk to Chancellor Gowron
as well.

188
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,521
They're headed
for the Klingon ship.

189
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,731
What if they discover
the cloaking device is missing?

190
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,857
Let's get out of here.

191
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,777
Where is it?

192
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,903
I'm not sure.

193
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,113
Well, find it.

194
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,869
Ow! Oh!

195
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,662
Good job, Brother.

196
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,831
But I wouldn't touch those
induction coils if I were you.

197
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:24,958
Thanks for the warning.

198
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,837
Up we go.

199
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:33,716
Come on, Ezri's waiting
for us in Cargo Bay 14.

200
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:50,984
QUARK:
One Klingon cloaking device
as requested.

201
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,362
As soon as I bring
that to the Regent

202
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,572
he'll release Zek.

203
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:56,990
Then what happens?

204
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,658
Then you get him back.

205
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,414
Would you stop doing that?

206
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,790
Doing what?

207
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,542
Staring at me.

208
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,587
Sorry, but you look
just like<i> our</i> Ezri

209
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,714
except you're a lot taller.

210
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,008
What are you talking about?

211
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,010
She's exactly the same height.

212
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,720
Uh, I don't think so.

213
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,306
Don't be an idiot.

214
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,976
I'm telling you,
they're identical... I think.

215
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,773
Do I have to throw you
off this transport pad?

216
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,691
One thing's for sure--

217
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,569
their personalities
aren't identical.

218
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:38,156
How do we know the Regent
will keep his word

219
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,782
and send Zek
back to us?

220
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,618
You don't.

221
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,870
But there's not much
you can do about it, is there?

222
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,330
Yes, there is.

223
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,207
Brother, I think
we should go with her.

224
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,209
I don't think you'll like it
too much on the other side.

225
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,252
That, I believe.

226
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,796
But my idiot
brother is right.

227
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:54,839
We're coming with you.

228
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,341
MARTOK:
Ferengi!

229
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,759
I'll have you
hanging by your ears.

230
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,137
Well, what are we
waiting for?

231
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,403
ROM:
It didn't work.

232
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,862
Yes, it did.

233
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,447
We're on Terok Nor.

234
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,700
It looks like Deep
Space 9 to me.

235
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,078
I suppose a cargo bay
is a cargo bay

236
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,996
no matter what universe
you're in.

237
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,456
But this is an
alternate universe.

238
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,832
Shouldn't everything
be different?

239
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,543
It's different enough.

240
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,086
Remember what Captain
Sisko once told us--

241
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,505
in this universe,
we're both dead.

242
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,006
That's so sad.

243
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,299
I would have liked
to meet myself.

244
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,926
We better get moving.

245
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,553
I've got a ship waiting for us
on Landing Pad C.

246
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,929
What's the rush?

247
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,305
This is a rebel base

248
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,557
and we're working
for the Alliance.

249
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:48,851
Vic?

250
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,565
I thought you two were dead.

251
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:55,900
We are!

252
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,694
You're not a hologram.

253
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:58,986
A what?

254
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,619
Throw down your phasers,
Fontaine.

255
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,037
I'll see you in hell first.

256
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,166
(<i> yells</i> )

257
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,920
I can't believe it.

258
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,881
Julian just shot
Vic Fontaine.

259
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,842
I thought
Vic was his favorite singer.

260
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:25,680
No wonder they call it
the<i> alternate</i> universe.

261
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,396
You, behind the crates!

262
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,564
You can come out now.

263
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,358
Do as he says.

264
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,615
Well, well,
well...

265
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,492
look who we
have here.

266
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:48,119
I'll bet you're
surprised to see us

267
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,663
but I can explain.

268
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:52,666
You worthless
piece of space trash.

269
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,626
Don't hurt her!

270
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,461
(<i> groaning</i> )

271
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,216
Hey, you're supposed
to be the good guys!

272
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,973
My mistake.

273
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,933
SMILEY:
I'm sorry, Rom, but that
cloaking device of yours

274
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,602
is now the property of the
Terran Resistance Forces.

275
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,395
But you don't understand.

276
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,314
You have to give us back
the cloaking device.

277
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,232
We need it
to rescue the Nagus.

278
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,234
That's not who you should
be worried about right now.

279
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,362
Do you know what we do
to Alliance sympathizers?

280
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,446
Give it a rest,
Julian.

281
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,864
I'll give it a rest

282
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,240
just as soon as
these three

283
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,159
get what's
coming to them.

284
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,577
I don't know about you,
but I like our Bashir better.

285
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,911
SMILEY:
You have to forgive him.

286
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,372
He's had a rough
go of it lately.

287
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,790
He lost a close friend

288
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,709
in a skirmish
with Alliance troops.

289
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,252
This has nothing
to do with Jadzia.

290
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,004
Do you know what
would happen to us

291
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,506
if the Alliance got hold
of a cloaking device?

292
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,216
SMILEY:
It wouldn't be pretty.

293
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,343
They'd wipe us out
in a matter of weeks.

294
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,971
Besides, there's nothing I
<i>loathe</i> more than traitors.

295
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,431
I'm not a traitor.

296
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,475
She's right.

297
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,935
You have to believe in something
before you can betray it.

298
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,855
I believe in getting paid
for my work

299
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,315
and you still owe me
for the last job I did for you.

300
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,025
We're fighting

301
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,277
for our freedom here--
for our very lives--

302
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,405
and all you care about is money?

303
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,324
Like you said, you have
to have something to believe in.

304
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,869
Let me ram those words
down her throat.

305
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:12,787
You're forgetting something,
Julian.

306
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,789
The Alliance didn't get
the cloaking device-- we did

307
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,833
and that gives us the edge--
and we have

308
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,501
these gentlemen
to thank for it.

309
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,337
So what do you want to do--
give them medals?

310
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,172
I don't think
their Captain Sisko

311
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,258
would be too pleased to
know they were over here

312
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,634
interfering
in our affairs.

313
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,845
That's why we
didn't tell him.

314
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,347
Huh. Thought as much.

315
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,392
I say we send them back
to where they belong--

316
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:35,685
let Sisko deal with them.

317
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,604
We can't go back...

318
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,146
not without Zek.

319
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,940
The way I see it,
you've got two choices.

320
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,526
You can either head back
to where you came from

321
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,820
or you can head
for Alliance territory

322
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,988
and try to rescue your friend
without the cloaking device.

323
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,449
You have

324
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,492
till morning to decide.

325
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,453
Either way...

326
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,746
you're staying with us.

327
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,962
Tough break.

328
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,464
I'll live.

329
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,924
Are you sure?

330
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:07,049
(<i> sighs</i> )

331
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,509
Don't worry about me.

332
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,720
Smiley's right about one thing--

333
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,139
if you're found
in Alliance territory

334
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,767
without the cloaking device,
you're dead.

335
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,936
Are you suggesting we
should go back home?

336
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,854
It's the smart move.

337
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,442
Do we look
smart to you?

338
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,287
You have such nimble fingers,
my dear.

How many times
have I heard that?

341
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,210
I don't think
I could survive

342
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,463
this incarceration
without them.

343
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:48,758
Oh, I'm glad to be of help.

I only wish I could
return the favor.

After all, you've
been suffering here

for a lot longer
than I have.

347
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,309
It hasn't been too bad.

348
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,061
I always find a way
of amusing myself

349
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,397
and besides,
when your people

350
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,984
give the Regent
the cloaking device

351
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:07,485
we'll both be free.

don't screw things up.

You guaranteed it!

00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:31,509
Well, so I said,
and so they shall.

360
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,471
Well, then we have
nothing to worry about.

361
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,057
(<i> laughing</i> )

362
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:42,896
Oh... so fragile.

363
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:46,941
Ah.

364
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,949
That's quite a temper
you have, my dear.

365
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,702
Mmm. It's one
of my best features.

366
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:00,287
Now, where were we?

367
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:05,835
Mind going back to tugging
at my ear hairs?

368
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,587
Mmm...

369
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:11,215
your wish is my command.

370
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,550
(<i> giggling</i> )

371
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,477
We have to find
a way out of here.

372
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,187
And then?

373
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,398
And then we get our hands
on the cloaking device

374
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:28,566
and finish what we started.

375
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,445
All right. Let's say
you manage to save

376
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,863
this Grand Nagus
of yours...

377
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,031
then what?

378
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:37,491
Then we go home...

379
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,535
and never come
back here again.

380
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,037
That's it?

381
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,455
Isn't it enough?

382
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,373
Quark, don't play dumb with me.

383
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,042
You're risking your life
for him.

384
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,585
There has to be a reason for it.

385
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,629
He's the Nagus,
he's the man my mother loves

386
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,298
not to mention, he's the head
of the Ferengi Alliance.

387
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:55,051
In other words, he's rich.

388
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,177
(<i> chuckling</i> )

389
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,640
They don't come any richer.

390
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,349
I see.

391
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,435
How much are you expecting
to get out of him?

392
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,646
Knowing the Nagus,
I'd say...

393
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:10,274
a pat on the head
and a fistful of empty promises.

394
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,609
I don't understand.

395
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,360
There's nothing to understand.

396
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,321
He's my Nagus...

397
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,031
and when your Nagus
gets in trouble

398
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:19,241
you're supposed
to do something about it.

399
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,327
Why?

400
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,537
I don't know.

401
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,331
Loyalty?

402
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,833
You're kidding me, right?

403
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,459
You're doing this
out of loyalty?

404
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:29,877
Would you stop looking
at me like that?

405
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,378
You're making me feel
like an idiot.

406
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:32,713
EZRI:
I hope so.

407
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,965
Brother...

408
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:36,300
I just realized something.

409
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,177
This should be good.

410
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,220
This is supposed to be
an alternate universe

411
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,475
but their Captain O'Brien seems
as nice as our Chief O'Brien.

412
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:46,435
So?
Don't you see?

413
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,812
It doesn't make any sense.

414
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:50,523
It's not "alternate."

415
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,191
Go back to sleep, Rom.

416
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,194
Right...

417
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,489
but it's all very confusing.

418
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,908
(<i> phaser fire</i> )

419
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:01,993
What was that?

420
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,955
How would I know?

421
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,500
ROM:
Brother, look out!

422
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,751
It's Brunt!

423
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,336
QUARK:
I don't think

424
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,504
it's<i> our</i> Brunt.

425
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:14,922
What took
you so long?

426
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,299
Sorry.
Been a little busy.

427
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,010
I had to break
into the cargo bay

428
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,220
steal back the cloaking
device<i> you</i> lost

429
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,638
and get it into our ship.

430
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,057
But on top of that...

431
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,307
Okay, quit your
complaining

432
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,392
and get us
out of here.

433
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,102
I'm... working on it.

434
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,187
Aah...

435
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,402
You two must be hungry.

436
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:37,820
I've got food and drink

437
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,030
waiting for you
on the ship.

438
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,159
He's so nice.

439
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,369
Scary, isn't it?

440
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,673
(<i> low engine rumble</i> )

441
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,466
What was that?

442
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,928
Brunt modified
the dilithium matrix

443
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,470
to maximize the output.

444
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,057
He did, did he?

445
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:08,017
He's a very
good engineer.

446
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,769
He's also
a very good cook.

447
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,897
These fried tube grubs
are dee-licious.

448
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,899
Better hope
he didn't poison them.

449
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,526
(<i> chuckling</i> )

450
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,361
Mmm...

451
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,488
maybe in our universe,
he'd do something like that--

452
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:22,907
but not over here.

453
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:25,492
Over here, everything's...

454
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,994
alternate.

455
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,996
So he's a nice guy.

456
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:32,083
Which means the tube grubs here
<i>should</i> be poisonous

457
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,668
because they're not
poisonous on our side.

458
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,504
But if Brunt
gave us poisonous

459
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,257
tube grubs...

460
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:40,758
it would mean he wasn't as nice
as we think he is

461
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:41,884
but he<i> has</i> to be nice

462
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,302
because our Brunt isn't.

463
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,221
Rom you're driving
me crazy.

464
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,722
It's not me, Brother.
It's this alternate universe.

465
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,807
It just doesn't
make any sense.

466
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:48,808
More tube grubs?

467
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,268
Yes, please.

468
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:51,560
No.

469
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,937
Yes!

470
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,608
Oh, no.

471
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:59,610
In case you get hungry.

472
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,323
I put a cup of hot tea
by your bunk.

473
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,325
You should get some rest.

474
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,744
(<i> groaning</i> )

475
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,412
It has been a long day.

477
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,373
You're telling me.

478
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:21,423
We're not due
to rendezvous

479
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,301
with the Regent's ship
for another 46 hours.

480
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:25,886
I'll wake you
long before that.

481
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,354
(<i> laughing</i> )

482
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:40,693
I'd like to see the look
on Bashir's face

483
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,153
when he discovers

484
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:45,281
we've stolen back
the cloaking device.

485
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,574
You think he and Smiley
will come after us?

486
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,451
Oh, they can't
let the Regent

487
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,369
get his hands
on that technology.

488
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,873
Sounds like your sympathies
are with the rebels.

489
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,499
I hate the Alliance.

490
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,835
Then why help them get
the cloaking device?

491
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,879
Ezri and I are partners.

492
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,463
More than that--

493
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,924
she's...

494
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,219
the closest friend
I've ever had.

495
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,386
And how close is that?

496
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,852
Not as close as I'd like.

497
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:17,271
Too bad.

498
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,274
I'm not her type.

499
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:23,903
And I don't think you are,
either.

500
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,612
What makes you say that?

501
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:29,116
Let's just say that
when it comes to men, she's...

502
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,077
very particular.

503
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,547
(<i> sneezing loudly</i> )

504
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,593
Interesting.

505
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,596
My sinuses are clear
for the first time in years.

506
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:53,515
See if this Ferengi has any more
of this... beetle snuff.

507
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,017
Certainly. But
first, my Regent

508
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,852
I must talk to you
about the Intendant.

509
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,520
It's taken us
over two years

510
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,898
to track down that
treacherous wench.

511
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:03,525
We should eliminate her
and be done with it.

512
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,819
I will deal with
the Intendant

513
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,446
in my own way and
in my own time

514
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,783
but first, I want
that cloaking device!

515
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,576
Yes.

516
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:13,994
Think of it--

517
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,496
with a fleet of
cloaked ships

518
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:20,084
I will be able to crush
the rebellion once and for all!

519
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:24,338
And then, we can
kill the Intendant.

520
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,259
We will see.

521
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,643
ROM:
Big ship.

522
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,937
How do we know we
can trust the Regent?

523
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,772
Once he has the
cloaking device

524
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:44,650
there's nothing to stop
him from killing us all.

525
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,653
It's a little late
to back out now, Quark.

526
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,447
By bringing him
the cloaking device

527
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:51,240
you've proven yourself useful.

528
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,117
Believe me

529
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:55,493
the Regent never gets rid
of anyone he finds useful.

530
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,458
I hope you're right.

531
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,042
Me, too.

532
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:11,927
You-- come here.

533
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,179
Your Regent needs you.

534
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:23,981
Nice fit.

535
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:29,403
Our visitors from the other
universe have arrived

536
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:30,904
and I'm happy to report

537
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,739
they have not come
empty-handed.

538
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,624
Look who the Regent is.

539
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,251
So?

540
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,337
So who's president
of the Federation? Gul Dukat?

541
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:48,214
They don't have
a Federation here.

542
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,216
Is there a problem,
Ferengi?

543
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:55,304
Just ignore him.

544
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,306
Now...

545
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,557
if you'll give us the Nagus,
we'll be on our way

546
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:03,062
and you can go on with your
plans for mass destruction

547
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,939
genocide and all those
other good things.

548
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:09,068
Victory is finally
within my grasp.

549
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,737
I want this operational
within the hour.

550
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,948
And it will be so,
Exalted One.

551
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,119
We have a deal, right?

552
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,913
Do we?

553
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,122
Tell him.

554
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,792
INTENDANT:
Yes, my dear...

555
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,337
why don't you tell him?

556
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:35,386
(<i> quiet chuckle</i> )

557
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:38,138
I knew you wouldn't
disappoint me.

558
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,938
Uh-oh.

559
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,982
You're not going to give
us the Nagus, are you?

560
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,114
You...

561
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,950
you knew about
this all along.

562
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,493
What can I say?

563
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,245
I'm loyal to my friends.

564
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:04,206
Isn't she just
the best?

565
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,833
I don't understand--
you're letting her go?

566
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,626
She earned it.

567
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:11,255
Having them bring us the
cloaking device was her idea.

568
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,341
Get rid of these two.

569
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,927
Is that really necessary?
They could come in handy.

570
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:19,012
If the Regent
wants your opinion

571
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,681
he'll<i> ask</i> for it.

572
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,850
Do not kill them just yet.

573
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,227
But Your Magnificence...

574
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:26,312
You heard me!

575
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,232
Lock them up.

576
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:32,359
Let's go.

577
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:35,237
I hope you two are
very happy together.

578
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:37,114
We will be.

579
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:54,173
<i>Our</i> Ezri would never betray us,
which means...

580
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,549
Oh, don't start
with that again.

581
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,384
Right...

582
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:00,387
Rom, you're not going
to tell your mother

583
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,722
about the Intendant
and me, are you?

584
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,475
It would break
her heart.

585
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,435
In a million pieces.

586
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:09,146
You see,
she worships me...

587
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,315
and I worship her
right back.

588
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:14,026
Besides, this is
all your fault.

589
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,236
If it weren't for you,
I never would have

590
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,238
been able
to get to this universe.

591
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:21,074
You remember the last time
you came home

592
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,326
to visit your mother?

593
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,743
Well, one night

594
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:26,413
while you were sleeping,
I got up to get

595
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,873
a bite to eat.

596
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,583
And there

597
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:34,963
on the kitchen table,
was a Starfleet padd.

598
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,508
My... engineering notebook?

599
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,679
With the schematics
for the multidimensional

600
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,430
transporter
that Chief O'Brien

601
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,473
gave me to study.

602
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:45,891
You stole it!

603
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,434
I'm your Nagus.

604
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:50,437
You have no secrets from me.

605
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,231
I still don't understand

606
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:55,484
why you'd want to come here
in the first place.

607
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,027
Simple, really.

608
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:59,697
I came to find new
financial opportunities

609
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:01,448
for the Ferengi people.

610
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,617
In the alternate
universe?!

611
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:09,289
Well... it seemed like
a good idea at the time.

612
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,416
Right now

613
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:11,833
it would be a good idea

614
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,670
for us to find a way
out of here.

615
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:19,091
I just don't feel right
about this.

616
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,800
Quark and Rom
deserve better.

617
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,428
Forget about them,
all right?

618
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,471
That's just it--
I can't.

619
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,181
I like them...

620
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,600
and so do you.

621
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,060
Don't tell me
who I like.

622
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,397
Talk to the Intendant--
she listens to you.

623
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,357
Tell her the Ferengi
kept their part of the bargain.

624
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:36,650
We should do the same.

625
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,444
What a novel idea.

626
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,070
Now, I can't
remember

627
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,030
the last time I kept<i> my</i> word.

628
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,199
Maybe now's a good time
to start.

629
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,618
Forget it, Brunt.

630
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:47,578
No, not this time.

631
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:49,121
That's all right.

632
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,625
Let him talk, my dear.

633
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,126
He obviously feels

634
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,503
very<i> passionately</i>
about this

635
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,256
and you know how responsive
I am to passion.

636
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:00,633
Go on.

637
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:03,427
What do we gain
from their death?

638
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:04,928
Nothing.

639
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,347
On the other hand,
if we let them live

640
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,767
they may come in handy.

641
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:11,810
I never thought
of that.

642
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,853
The Regent will
give them to you.

643
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,231
All you have to do is ask.

644
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,024
Maybe...

645
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,694
but why waste a favor on
those two little trolls?

646
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:22,279
No, I'm afraid

647
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,739
I don't much care
for your suggestion

648
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:26,241
and as a matter
of fact...

649
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,702
I don't much
like you, either.

650
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:30,788
(<i> groans</i> )

651
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:32,164
No!

652
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,625
He was going
to betray me.

653
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,460
I could see it
in his eyes.

654
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:41,089
You wouldn't do that
to me, would you?

655
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,841
Would you?!

656
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:48,305
Oh... oh, oh, oh, no.

657
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:51,350
No. No, of course
you wouldn't.

658
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,519
(<i> sighing</i> )

659
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,355
I...

660
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:57,939
I've suffered so many

661
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,400
disappointments
in my life--

662
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,487
Brunt...
Sisko, Bareil...

663
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,739
the list goes
on and on.

664
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:06,948
(<i> sighs</i> )

665
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,534
Dispose of that,
would you?

666
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:09,576
It depresses me.

667
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,497
It's your mess.

668
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:14,914
You clean it up.

669
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:24,550
She's not afraid of anyone,
is she?

670
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,385
Not even me.

671
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:33,475
Regent, long-range sensors
have detected an enemy ship.

672
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:35,060
It's the<i> Defiant.</i>

673
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,687
Excellent!

674
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:38,397
It is time to test
the cloaking device.

675
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:41,734
Um, I'm afraid
it's not yet operational.

676
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,112
And why is that?

677
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:49,616
Well, it's a<i> very</i> complicated
piece of equipment.

678
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,577
One of the Ferengi
seemed to know

679
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:52,703
how it worked.

680
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:54,287
Then why is he not here?

681
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,289
I'll get him.

682
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:02,379
Getting the cloaking
device on line?

683
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:03,463
That's simple.

684
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,548
Good.

685
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,007
Lower the force field.

686
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,426
QUARK:
Hold on a second.

687
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,428
Why should we help
the Regent?

688
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,846
Or you, for that matter?

689
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:13,973
I'm trying
to save your lives.

690
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:16,435
That's a very
worthy goal!

691
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:19,354
Since when do you care
about what happens to us?

692
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,647
All right, forget it.

693
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,232
I don't want
to forget it.

694
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:24,109
I'm sorry, Brother.

695
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,904
Maybe you want to die in this
crazy, mixed-up universe

696
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:28,154
but I don't.

697
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,782
Neither do I!

698
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:32,158
Lower the force field.

699
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,291
I suppose we have
nothing to lose.

700
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,919
Where do you think
you're going?

701
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,962
With him-- he
needs my help.

702
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,631
You're a bartender, Quark.

703
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:47,633
What are you going to do,
mix him a drink?

704
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,262
Don't worry,
Brother.

705
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:53,680
I'm not thirsty.

706
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,349
I don't expect you
to believe this

707
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,226
but I<i> am</i> trying
to help you.

708
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,021
You're right!

709
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,357
I don't believe you.

710
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,860
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

711
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,361
Isodine coupler.

712
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:15,118
Does this look like
an isodine coupler to you?

713
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,370
I don't see how anything
gets fixed around here!

714
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,956
I'd advise you

715
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:21,082
to watch your tone
of voice, Ferengi!

716
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,376
Or what?

717
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,505
You won't let me install
the cloaking device?!

718
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:32,427
I'm... sorry if
I've upset you.

719
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:37,516
Now, will you please
get back to work?

720
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,645
Don't mind if I do.

721
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,523
(<i> whispering</i> )

722
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,358
Oh.

723
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,985
Really?

724
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:49,319
Absolutely.

725
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,946
I have never
tried that before.

726
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,447
Few man have,
but I think

727
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,407
you'll find it
very stimulating.

728
00:33:57,703 --> 00:34:00,121
What do you expect
in return?

729
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,248
Terok Nor,
of course.

730
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:05,251
I<i> was</i> planning on
destroying that station.

731
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,086
Plans can
be changed.

732
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,674
I will consider it.

733
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:12,885
What more
can I ask?

734
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:14,427
ROM:
Uh...

735
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,388
(<i> singsongy</i> ):
Mr. Regent...

736
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,348
What is it?

737
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:19,725
Your cloak is ready.

738
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,142
Ah.

739
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,769
GARAK:
I'll take over from here.

740
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,282
It's working.

741
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,492
Well done.

742
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,160
INTENDANT:
You mean, no one

743
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,495
can see us?

744
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,455
How deliciously
deceitful.

745
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,376
Are you certain you
know how to operate

746
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:47,961
the device?

747
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,880
Well, what I don't know,
I always can learn.

748
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,590
ROM:
It's pretty simple

749
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,299
once you understand the basics.

750
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:57,345
Now... what about my brother
and the Nagus?

751
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,849
Do we have any
further use for them?

752
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:02,559
Not that I
can think of.

753
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,185
Then get rid of them.

754
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,772
You mean, we're going home?

755
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:08,147
No.

756
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,316
He means you're
going to die.

757
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:11,985
That settles it!

758
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:15,030
I'm never helping
you again!

759
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,698
Or anyone else,
for that matter.

760
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,199
Come along, now.

761
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,911
I'm really beginning
to hate this universe.

762
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,209
GARAK:
What we have here,
gentlemen

763
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:32,965
is 10cc's of concentrated
Ulcartic virus.

764
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:38,804
It's very deadly
and quite painful.

765
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:41,139
It elevates the temperature
of your body

766
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:45,685
heating your internal organs
until they literally boil.

767
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:48,271
I was hoping
to use this

768
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,231
on the Intendant,
but I suppose

769
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,318
I'll have to settle
for the for the four of you.

770
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,903
Now...

771
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:58,031
who would like to go first?

772
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,374
I'm waiting.

773
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,417
(<i> chuckles</i> )

774
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,794
Why don't you give us

775
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,004
a couple of days
to think it over

776
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:13,254
and we'll get back to you.

777
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,881
All right, then,
I'll pick.

778
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,008
Let's see...

779
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,425
What an amateur.

780
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,718
Excuse me?

781
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,887
I mean, compared
to our Garak.

782
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,974
Now that man knows
how to conduct
an interrogation.

783
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:25,767
I'm not interrogating anyone.

784
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:27,477
ZEK:
Why not?

785
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,855
Did it ever occur to you
that we may know things

786
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:32,774
that you could use
to your advantage?

787
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,067
Like what?

788
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,443
We're not going to tell you--

789
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,362
not unless you
interrogate us.

790
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,447
I don't have time for this.

791
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,200
I want to be on the Bridge
when we destroy the<i> Defiant.</i>

792
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:48,540
In our universe,
work comes before pleasure.

793
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,249
Our Garak

794
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,002
would have us hanging
by our toenails by now

795
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:54,420
telling him
all our secrets.

796
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,505
What secrets?

797
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:56,589
That's for us to know

798
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,175
and you to find out.

799
00:36:58,175 --> 00:37:00,426
If you were smart

800
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:03,055
you'd cross over
to our universe

801
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,890
and get some pointers
from our Garak.

802
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,933
When it comes
to torture

803
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,601
assassination
and sabotage

804
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,770
you could learn
a lot from him.

805
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,149
I know all there is
to know about sabotage.

806
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:15,901
(<i> laughing</i> )

807
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,694
That's not what<i> we</i> hear.

808
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,328
Something's wrong.

809
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,454
We should have caught
that Ferengi ship long ago.

810
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:29,497
We'll find them.

811
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,290
For all we know

812
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,251
the Regent may already
have the cloaking device.

813
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,253
In fact, he might have us
in his sights right now

814
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,838
and we wouldn't
even know it.

815
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:39,007
Don't start getting
paranoid, Smiley.

816
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,218
Even if the Regent
has the cloaking device

817
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:43,261
chances are,
it isn't functional yet.

818
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,679
I hope you're right.

819
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:07,368
They have no idea
that we are behind them.

820
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:10,997
There's nothing I enjoy
better than a good ambush.

821
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,583
It is time.

822
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,094
I don't understand.

823
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:26,054
Is this Garak of yours
an assassin

824
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,472
or a tailor?

825
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,266
An assassin.
Both.
Tailor.

826
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:30,642
Never mind.

827
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,560
I have to be back on the Bridge.

828
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,770
Now...

829
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,605
who's first?

830
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,774
Drop the cloak!

831
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:49,202
I hate it
when you're right.

832
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:51,079
Evasive action-- now!

833
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,164
Fire!

834
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,043
What was that?

835
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,753
Sabotage--
what else?

836
00:38:58,753 --> 00:38:59,963

837
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:01,089

838
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,340
We've experienced

839
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,591
primary system
failure.

840
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:04,592
That Ferengi,
he did this!

841
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:05,927
I'm unable

842
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,304
to get anything back on line.

843
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:08,680
(<i> frustrated grunting</i> )

844
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:11,390
(<i> yelling</i> )

845
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,767
You taught me

846
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,894
something
about sabotage, and now

847
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,022
I'm going to teach you
something about pain.

848
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:18,731
(<i> groaning</i> )
(<i> laughing</i> )

849
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,108

(<i> breathing heavily</i> )

852
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,326
How much is this
going to cost us?

853
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:31,452
I'm not doing this
for money.

854
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:34,206
Then why?

855
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:38,043
Do you want to get out
of here or not?

856
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,794
Of course we do.

857
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,380
Then stop asking questions
and let's go.

858
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,305
They're not coming
after us.

859
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:51,389
Why not?

860
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,640
They can't.

861
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,684
Their power grid's off-line.

862
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:57,229
(<i> chuckles</i> )

863
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:58,730
Then what do you say

864
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,856
we give the Regent
a proper greeting?

865
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:01,024
Reversing course.

866
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:12,327
We must raise shields!

867
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:14,996
We can't!

868
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:18,208
I don't know how much more of
this the hull can withstand.

869
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:22,461
HELMSMAN:
Captain O'Brien
would like

870
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,504
to have a word with you.

871
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,467
O'BRIEN:
That's a nice ship you have

872
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,677
Regent.

873
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,263
I'd hate to see it destroyed.

874
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:33,223
But, of course,
if you insist...

875
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,601
(<i> sighs</i> )

876
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,438
What are your terms?

877
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:44,192
Ooh, a simple
unconditional surrender

878
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,277
should do the trick.

879
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:46,527
INTENDANT:
I'm afraid

880
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,737
you've run out of options.

00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:53,910
Victory is yours.

WORF:
I have been betrayed.

885
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,544
I knew I should have killed
those two Ferengi

886
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,922
the moment they came aboard.

887
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:12,429
(<i> frustrated grunting</i> )

888
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,274
What a surprise.

889
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:26,359
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

890
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,236
Here I am.

891
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:31,239
Is that really necessary?

892
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:34,575
I was about to ask you
the same question.

893
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:45,211
Ah.

894
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,171
(<i> laughs</i> )

895
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,256
That's better.

896
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:51,426
You and I have to get
to one of the escape shuttles.

897
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,677
You go.

898
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,179
I'm staying here.

899
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:55,680
You can't be serious.

900
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,556
You shouldn't
have killed Brunt.

901
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:00,435
Isn't it a little late
to be developing a conscience?

902
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:01,894
I hope not.

903
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:08,443
Brunt's dead?

904
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:09,694
Sorry...

905
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:11,321
wrong Brunt.

906
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:13,490
We're not going to let
her get away, are we?

907
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,908
I owe her that much.

908
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:18,661
Oh, let her go.

909
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,706
There's something
about that woman

910
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:23,582
I find intoxicating.

911
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,011
(<i> cheering</i> )

912
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,145
ROM:
Glad to be
going home?

913
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:45,730
You<i> bet</i> I am.

914
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,607
That doesn't mean
I won't be coming back.

915
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,485
Here?
What for?

916
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:53,612
There's a fortune to be made
in the alternate universe.

917
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,365
I can feel it in my lobes.

918
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:56,866
Well, don't
expect us

919
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:58,451
to come chasing
after you again.

920
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,619
Oh, no, I won't.

921
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:04,123
(<i> laughs</i> ):
Next time, I'll bring you
along with me.

922
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,375
In that case

923
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:06,959
I won't bother
saying good-bye.

924
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,961
You know...

925
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:12,340
coming back here
isn't such a bad idea...

926
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,801
if I knew I could see you again.

927
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:19,264
I'm not going anywhere.

928
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:21,849
I could stick around
a couple of days.

929
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,518
You could show me the station.

930
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:26,229
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

931
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:30,525
I could help you work
on that<i> conscience</i> of yours.

932
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:32,777
I think I can take it from here.

933
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,737
Excuse me.

934
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:35,821
Leeta?

935
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,200
Do I know you?

936
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,369
We're married!

937
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:42,579
(<i> incredulous</i>
<i>chuckle</i> )

938
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:44,914
I don't think so.

939
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:47,542
You're Ezri, right?

940
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:51,504
Captain Smiley wants
me to<i> debrief</i> you.

941
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:53,756
Must be my lucky day.

942
00:43:56,926 --> 00:44:00,930
This is<i> quite</i>
a fascinating place

943
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,099
don't you agree?

944
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:04,476
I want to go home.

945
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,062
Me, too.
