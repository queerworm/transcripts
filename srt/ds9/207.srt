1
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:04,755
(<i> snoring</i> )

2
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:07,090
ODO:
All right, Morn.
You know the rules.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,802
No sleeping on the Promenade.
Go home.

4
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,871
QUARK:
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

5
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,233
The risk is to you,
Lieutenant.

6
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,444
I could probably think better
without your hand on my thigh.

7
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:13,032
Now, how did
that get there?

8
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:14,700
(<i> snickering</i> )

9
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,577
So, uh, what's it
going to be?

10
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,954
Confront, evade,
acquire, retreat...

11
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,207
Confront.

12
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,918
(<i> groaning</i> )

13
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,795
Yes!

14
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:27,963
Doesn't she
ever lose?

15
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,339
QUARK:
Tell me, Lieutenant

16
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,174
how'd you get to be
so good at<i> tongo?</i>

17
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,635
Actually, it was Curzon
who played it all the time.

18
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,262
Well, that explains it.

19
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,890
It's Curzon who's beating
us-- not this female.

20
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,391
This female happens
to be a better player

21
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,893
than Curzon ever was.

22
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,686
And a prettier one, too.

23
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:46,440
Maybe so, but I still
prefer a Ferengi female--

24
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,191
one who never
wears clothes,

25
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,317
never talks back,

26
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,862
and never
plays<i> tongo!</i>

27
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,531
Is that really how
you prefer your women--

28
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,116
naked and submissive?

29
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,660
You find such
a lifestyle appealing?

30
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,579
Ah, don't you wish?

31
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:03,749
I do,
I really do.

32
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:05,250
All right.

33
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,544
The opening risk is at
five strips of latinum.

34
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:08,503
The purchase is at three

35
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:09,546
the sell is at eight.

36
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,547
(<i> whispering</i> )

37
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,590
Absolutely not.

38
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,800
(<i> whispering</i> )

39
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,884
This isn't the proper time!

40
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,803
I'm trying to concentrate.

41
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,304
I'm sorry, Brother.

42
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:18,847
It's this insolent
young waiter's fault.

43
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,015
My apologies, Quark,

44
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,892
but I really think
you should try this.

45
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,310
What is it?

46
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,979
A way to double
your beverage profits.

47
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:26,021
Taste it.

48
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,862
You see, just as I told you.

49
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,030
He immediately
reached for his drink.

50
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,323
So I did.

51
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,832
Amazing.

52
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,207
You don't even
realize you're thirsty.

53
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,250
What are they?

54
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,128
Gramilian sand peas.

55
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:51,379
They inhibit the secretion
of the salivary glands

56
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,590
while drying out
the tissues of the tongue.

57
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,967
It works every time.

58
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,886
If you replace

59
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,263
your complimentary
dishes of<i> lokar</i> beans

60
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,516
with Gramilian sand peas,
you won't be able

61
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,852
to fill your customers'
glasses fast enough.

62
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,353
What's your
name again?

63
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,479
Pel.

64
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,107
So, what do you think
about my idea?

65
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,274
I think
I agree with

66
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,734
the 59th Rule
of Acquisition.

67
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,903
Free advice
is seldom cheap.

68
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,823
True, but
the 22nd Rule says

69
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:20,450
a wise man can hear
profit in the wind.

70
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,743
I see you know
your Rules.

71
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,830
All 285 of them

72
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,624
and the various commentaries
on them, as well.

73
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,293
I don't plan on being
a waiter forever.

74
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,337
Good, then you're fired.

75
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,421
Shut up, Rom.

76
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,049
When it comes
to business,

77
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:38,093
my brother has the weak
little lobes of a female.

78
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:41,221
So, uh, what made you take
a job here at the station?

79
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,432
I wanted to learn
from the very best.

80
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,018
Uh-huh, which
brings to mind

81
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,020
the 33rd Rule
of Acquisition.

82
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,522
BOTH:
It never hurts
to suck up to the boss.

83
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:51,648
(<i> laughing</i> )

84
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,110
(<i> beeping</i> )

85
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,153
DAX:
What's that?

86
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,030
The Grand Nagus Zek's

87
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,865
personal subspace
frequency.

88
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,868
ROM:
I wonder what he wants.

89
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,079
Why do you look so surprised?

90
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,830
I told you I'd be back.

91
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,999
Uh, I've looked forward
to your return, Nagus.

92
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:13,087
Still the perfect
little toady, eh, Quark?

93
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:14,088
I try to be.

94
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:15,589
Then listen carefully.

95
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,050
The Ferengi expansion
into the Gamma Quadrant

96
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,426
is about to begin.

97
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,846
I'd like you to be
my chief negotiator.

98
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,098
Me?

99
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:25,682
That's right.

100
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,102
I'm offering you an opportunity

101
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:31,230
to make more profit
than you ever dreamed of.

102
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,398
All you have to do is earn it.

103
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,650
(<i> sighing</i> )

104
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,940
Can I interest you
in some Hupyrian beetle snuff?

105
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,941
I don't think so.

106
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:40,942
Major?

107
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,027
No, thank you.

108
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,695
Well, suit yourself.

109
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,530
More for me.

110
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,532
(<i> snorting</i> )

111
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,831
(<i> sneezes</i> )

112
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,501
Little late, aren't we?

113
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,381
(<i> blows nose</i> )

114
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,093
So you wanted
to see me, Commander?

115
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,969
I understand you're
planning to host

116
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,679
a business conference
here at the station.

117
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:13,308
Yes, with the Dosi,
a race from the Gamma Quadrant.

118
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,310
A very profitable
opportunity for all concerned

119
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,519
I might add.

120
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,479
Profitable for
the Ferengi, maybe.

121
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,690
Are you implying
something, Major?

122
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,276
Me? Not at all, no.

123
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:25,195
The Ferengi reputation
speaks for itself.

124
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:29,824
A reputation for honesty
and decency and reliability.

125
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,244
You always know what to expect

126
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:34,329
when you do business
with the Ferengi.

127
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,247
KIRA:
Which is why

128
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:36,706
if you're smart

129
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,125
you don't do business
with the Ferengi.

130
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,043
I think you've made
your point, Major.

131
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:43,297
As misinformed and misguided
as it may be.

132
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:46,758
Besides, how we do business
is no concern of yours.

133
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,927
Except when you conduct
your business on this station.

134
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,137
In other words, Zek,

135
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,013
Grand Nagus or no Grand Nagus,

136
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,766
if we allow you to hold
your negotiations here

137
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:57,144
and we find out
you're cheating the Dosi,

138
00:07:57,144 --> 00:08:00,981
I'll see to it you never
set foot on this station again.

139
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:04,234
Did anyone ever tell
you your eyes shine

140
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,988
with the brilliance of
Kibberian fire diamonds?

141
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,530
Not that I recall.

142
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,241
Well, they do.

143
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:15,536
So, tell me, Major,
could Bajor use

144
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:19,582
50,000 kilos of
brizeen nitrate?

145
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,794
Of course, we could.

146
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,672
With that much brizeen,
we could fertilize

147
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,674
the entire
northern peninsula.

148
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,177
Well, I've recently
come into possession

149
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,471
of 50,000 kilos
of brizeen nitrate,

150
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:37,684
and to show you how much
your cooperation means to me,

151
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:41,188
I'll let you have
the entire shipment.

152
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,899
I'll still need your assurances

153
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,027
that the Dosi will
be fairly treated

154
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,028
while they're here.

155
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,737
You have my word.

156
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:50,655
Good.

157
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:51,781
Then it's settled.

158
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,702
Now, let's see--

159
00:08:55,702 --> 00:09:00,540
50,000 kilos at, uh,
25% of our usual price.

160
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,749
25%? You just said

161
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,668
you were giving
it to them.

162
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,462
Well, you're
right, Commander.

163
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,214
We're all friends here.

164
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:10,300
So I'll let you
have it at cost.

165
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,593
I have
a better idea.

166
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,304
Why not consider
the nitrate

167
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,223
as a gift to the
people of Bajor?

168
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,807
A gift?

169
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,143
That doesn't sound
very profitable.

170
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,686
It depends.

171
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:22,896
On what?

172
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,314
On whether you want

173
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,607
to conduct business
here or not.

174
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,193
(<i> laughing</i> )

175
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,737
Your negotiating skills

176
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:34,574
aren't bad
for a hu-man.

177
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,745
Your nitrate will be
delivered promptly.

178
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:43,666
Anything else you need,
come see me personally.

179
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,133
Well, Quark, I've been involved

180
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,220
in some very profitable
opportunities in my time,

181
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,097
but my lobes are telling me

182
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:01,435
that this may be
the<i> most</i> profitable opportunity

183
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:04,145
in Ferengi history.

184
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,355
Imagine that.

185
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,107
And part of those profits
will be mine.

186
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,150
Profit, fame, power--

187
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,152
as much as you want.

188
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:14,822
Tell me, uh, Nagus, what exactly
is this great opportunity?

189
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,366
I can sum it up
in one word--

190
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,909
tulaberries.

191
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,077
Tulaberries?

192
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,370
Exactly.

193
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,746
Go on.

194
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,331
Well, they're
the main ingredient

195
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,416
in tulaberry wine.

196
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,501
Your job will
be to purchase

197
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:29,670
10,000 vats
from the Dosi.

198
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,214
We're going
into the wine business?

199
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,507
Within
a single year,

200
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,092
we'll have made
tulaberry wine

201
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:37,345
the most popular drink
in their entire sector.

202
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,597
That's enough!

203
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:44,394
Oh, I like it--
very distinguished.

204
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:48,565
Tell me, Nagus--
how are tulaberries going to be

205
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,151
the most profitable opportunity
in Ferengi history?

206
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,320
Do I have to spell it out
for you?

207
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,946
If you don't mind.

208
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,114
Tulaberries

209
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,741
will establish
a Ferengi presence

210
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,577
inside the Gamma Quadrant.

211
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:03,079
And once we get our foot

212
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,872
in the door,

213
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,501
they'll never
get it out.

214
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,337
Yes, I see!

215
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:15,967
Tulaberries, Quark, tulaberries.

216
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,718
Tulaberries.

217
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:18,886
I wonder what
they taste like.

218
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,430
Who cares what
they taste like?

219
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,641
They're an opportunity
to get a Ferengi foot

220
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:23,933
in the Gamma
Quadrant door.

221
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,726
And it'll be
your foot, Brother.

222
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:26,936
I'm so proud.

223
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,272
I'm going to make
history, Rom,

224
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,149
and I'm going
to be rich.

225
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,817
And I have
the Grand Nagus

226
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:33,860
to thank for it.

227
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,070
He must really
like me.

228
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,531
Just remember one thing--

229
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:41,326
the bigger the smile,
the sharper the knife.

230
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,620
48th Rule
of Acquisition.

231
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,745
He has some nerve.

232
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,373
I warned you
about that fellow.

233
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,501
Pel, do you mind telling me
what you meant just now?

234
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,336
Did you ever think
about why the Nagus

235
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,672
has put you in charge
of such a lucrative opportunity?

236
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,089
Isn't it obvious?

237
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,715
He knows I have the
lobes for business.

238
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,218
That's only part of it.

239
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,344
I refuse to stand here

240
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,637
and allow my brother
to be insulted.

241
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:01,762
You're fired.

242
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:02,721
Shut up!

243
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:03,931
Go on.

244
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,059
If the negotiations
are profitable

245
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,144
then the Nagus becomes
the greatest hero ever,

246
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,646
but if they fail,

247
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,772
he's going to need
someone to take the blame.

248
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,107
You mean me?

249
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:16,611
All I'm saying is, be careful.

250
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,447
I never heard
such ridiculous lies.

251
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,866
He's just jealous
of your success, Brother.

252
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:22,909
No, he's right.

253
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:23,868
If something
goes wrong,

254
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,203
it'll be my fault.

255
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,205
Then you're going
to need help, Brother.

256
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,540
Yes!

257
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,999
Someone to serve
as your consultant

258
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,042
during negotiations.

259
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,043
Yes!

260
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,044
Someone like me.

261
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,546
No.

262
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:37,090
Uh, I've been thinking
about what you just said,

263
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,384
and, uh, I probably
could use some help

264
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,010
during these
negotiations.

265
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,011
I accept.

266
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:42,970
Good.

267
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,264
Then we're partners.

268
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,516
Not quite-- I don't
need a partner.

269
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,226
I need an assistant.

270
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,353
All right, but I get 25%
of everything you make.

271
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:51,354
Fifteen.

272
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,313
Twenty.

273
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,648
Done.

274
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,609
But, Brother,
what can I do to help?

275
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,318
You want
to help?

276
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,237
Table six
is waiting.

277
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,482
How do I look?

278
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:18,775
Nervous.

279
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,109
Who, me?

280
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,986
What have I got
to be nervous about?

281
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,613
Yeah, it's Zek
who should be nervous--

282
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,490
with Quark here
as his chief negotiator.

283
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,534
(<i> gasps</i> )

284
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,827
If you ever
do that again...

285
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:29,828
Do what?

286
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,705
If you ever
do that again,

287
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,748
I'll stick those 50,000 kilos
of brizeen right up your...

288
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,291
Here they
come!

289
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,378
(<i> shouting</i> )

290
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,796
MALE:
Don't worry

291
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,965
just a minor disagreement.

292
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,606
So, uh, can I get anyone
something to eat?

293
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,192
All right.

294
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,903
Um, in that case,
let's go over our offer.

295
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,531
As you know, the Ferengi
are interested in purchasing

296
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,658
10,000 vats
of tulaberry wine.

297
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,077
In exchange,
the Dosi will receive

298
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:14,163
what I consider to be
a very fair trade package.

299
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,416
There are some very interesting
items on that list--

300
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,667
a subspace field modulator,

301
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,085
uh, some optical
data processors...

302
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,713
We'll give
you 5,000 vats.

303
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:24,048
I'm afraid
that won't be enough.

304
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,967
Um, we're looking to establish
a vast distribution network

305
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,511
in the Gamma Quadrant.

306
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,388
We'll need
at least 10,000 vats.

307
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,891
I'm offering you
5,000 vats.

308
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:34,517
I suggest
you take it.

309
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,976
The Nagus will
never agree.

310
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,103
FEMALE:
This is

311
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,396
a waste of time.

312
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,273
We should be talking
directly to Zek.

313
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,858
I know we should
be talking to Zek.

314
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:45,945
Then why do you bother talking
to this insignificance?

315
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,154
Now, see what
you've done?

316
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,406
What?

317
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,990
You've made me
look foolish.

318
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,743
I didn't mean to.

319
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:52,993
Then bring us Zek.

320
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,579
PEL:
The Nagus has asked

321
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,414
Quark to represent him
during these negotiations.

322
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:57,874
Are you implying

323
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:00,376
that Zek is too important
to negotiate with us?!

324
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,878
We never meant to imply
anything of the sort.

325
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:05,089
Because,
if we kill you,

326
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:09,176
Zek will have
to talk to us.

327
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,471
You want to do business
with the Ferengi,

328
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,389
you talk to Quark.

329
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,606
QUARK:
So how about it?

330
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,190
Do we say 10,000 vats?

331
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,447
We'll think
about it.

332
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,248
Can I help you?

333
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,049
What is it?

334
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,891
DAX:
It's beautiful.

335
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,351
KIRA:
It's latinum.

336
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,854
Excuse me,
I really can't accept this.

337
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,231
Did Zek really think

338
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,358
this was going
to get him anywhere?

339
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,693
Probably not.

340
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,945
But it doesn't stop
a Ferengi from trying.

341
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:12,114
You sound like you
admire them for it.

342
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:15,242
I suppose,
in a way, I do.

343
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:18,663
I don't understand your
attitude about the Ferengi.

344
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,289
That's because you don't

345
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,583
socialize with them
the way I do.

346
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,544
Looking back
over seven lifetimes,

347
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,839
I can't think of a single
race I've enjoyed more.

348
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,590
Did anyone
ever tell you

349
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,801
you have very
strange taste?

350
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:35,013
I admit, they place
too much emphasis on profit,

351
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,932
and their behavior towards
women is somewhat primitive...

352
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,142
They're greedy,
misogynistic,

353
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,394
untrustworthy
little trolls,

354
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,896
and I wouldn't
turn my back

355
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,355
on one of them
for a second.

356
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:45,690
Neither would I.

357
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,233
But once you
accept that,

358
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,360
you'll find they
can be a lot of fun.

359
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,122
Evade.

360
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,585
Evade.

361
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,627
Retreat.

362
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,295
Acquire.

363
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,589
Confront.

364
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,260
Did I say "acquire"?

365
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,845
I meant "evade."

366
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:16,971
You said "acquire."

367
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,305
Well, I meant "evade"!

368
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,182
Why don't we just
play the round over?

369
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,434
That sounds fair.

370
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,936
Who asked you?

371
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,270
And shouldn't you
be plotting strategy

372
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,479
for tomorrow's negotiations?

373
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,773
Believe me, Nagus,

374
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,315
I've thought of nothing
else all evening.

375
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,192
That must be why
you're losing so badly.

376
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,905
And I think, by tomorrow,
we should have an agreement.

377
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:35,448
Well, I've been thinking, too,

378
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,826
and 10,000 vats
of tulaberry wine aren't enough.

379
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,411
Tell them we want 100,000.

380
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,038
100,000?

381
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:45,207
But I'm not sure they'll even
agree to sell us 10,000.

382
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,669
100,000 vats would mean
more profit for them and for us.

383
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,254
Now, do as I say!

384
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,715
Or I'm going to take over
the negotiations myself.

385
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:56,719
I think raising the stakes
is a brilliant idea.

386
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,845
You do?

387
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,138
It'll show the
Gamma Quadrant

388
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,347
we mean business.

389
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,600
No wonder Quark says
you're a genius.

390
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,727
Oh, he says that, does he?

391
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,604
All the time.

392
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:07,897
That's very touching.

393
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,273
Now bring me
some fresh tube grubs.

394
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,817
These are losing
their crunch.

395
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,485
Right away.

396
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:19,158
So, I believe the next
challenge goes to you.

397
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,244
I think I'll pass
on this round.

398
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,667
Such loyalty
must be expensive.

399
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,670
You can't buy
that kind of loyalty.

400
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,506
You can where
I come from.

401
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:37,301
Is the Nagus always
this impatient?

402
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,304
He wants results, and he
expects me to get them.

403
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,057
But he's not making
my job any easier.

404
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,935
100,000 vats-- that's
a lot of tulaberries.

405
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,561
You'll get them.

406
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,688
How can you
be so sure?

407
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,230
Because you're good,

408
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,400
and with me helping you,
you're even better.

409
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,445
Why are you being
so nice to me?

410
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,739
For 20% of your profits.

411
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,824
Why else?

412
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,743
Fair enough.

413
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,871
NAGUS:
Quark, where are my grubs?

414
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,372
Coming.

415
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:12,128
Mmm. Now this is
what I call fresh.

416
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:20,386
DAX:
I didn't know the Replimat
had a Ferengi menu.

417
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:21,470
It doesn't.

418
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,056
I like to try
new things.

419
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,016
That's unusual
for a Ferengi.

420
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:27,894
I never heard of a Trill
who could play<i> tongo.</i>

421
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,396
I guess that makes
us both unusual.

422
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,731
You know, I was impressed

423
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,858
by your show of loyalty
to Quark last night.

424
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:36,360
He deserves it.

425
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,820
That's not the point.

426
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,906
Any other Ferengi
would've let Zek

427
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,240
pick him to pieces.

428
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,658
But you're not like

429
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,827
any other Ferengi
I've ever met.

430
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,246
Quark really
likes you.

431
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:51,500
He talks about you
all the time.

432
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,793
You know he
once convinced me

433
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,837
to go up to a holosuite
with him?

434
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,296
Turns out, he recreated

435
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,174
the bedroom I slept in
as a child.

436
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,676
He overheard me
describing it to Kira.

437
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,220
Of course, most of the details
were wrong,

438
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,430
but it was
a very sweet gesture--

439
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,932
up until he tried
to kiss me.

440
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,725
That sounds
like Quark.

441
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,769
(<i> both laughing</i> )

442
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,353
I don't care
what anybody says.

443
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,563
I love him.

444
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:13,814
So do I.

445
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,775
You really do,
don't you?

446
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:16,817
What?

447
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,985
Love Quark.

448
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,195
Don't bother
trying to deny it.

449
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,863
I've seen the way
you look at him.

450
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:21,906
Please, keep
your voice down.

451
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,282
Does he know?

452
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,201
He doesn't even know
I'm a female.

453
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,244
You're a woman?

454
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:28,037
Please lower your voice.

455
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,413
Please.

456
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:32,374
I knew there was something
different about you.

457
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,460
But I've never met
a Ferengi woman before.

458
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,796
You probably
never will again.

459
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,547
On my world, women aren't
allowed to leave the house

460
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,716
or wear clothes,
or learn to read.

461
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:41,759
And you wanted more.

462
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,052
Why not?

463
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,512
I'm as smart as any man.

464
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,389
So I made myself a pair
of synthetic lobes

465
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,142
and became one.

466
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:50,309
Why come here?

467
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:54,313
To acquire profit,
of course.

468
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,732
There's only one thing
I wasn't counting on.

469
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,068
Falling in love
with Quark.

470
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:01,570
What do you think
I should do?

471
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,614
I don't know.

472
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:06,575
But I do know there's
more to life than profit.

473
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,744
Pel, it's time!

474
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,621
We don't want to keep
the Dosi waiting.

475
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,081
Hurry!

476
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,917
Okay, now, I
think our best...

477
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,933
(<i> murmuring approval</i> )

478
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:33,019
Excuse me.

479
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:35,395
Ah, Major.

480
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,857
Did that shipment
of brizeen nitrate

481
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:38,816
arrive on time?

482
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:39,942
Yes, it did.

483
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:40,901
Good.

484
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,153
And here you are
to thank me.

485
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:45,281
(<i> smarmily</i> ):
Have a seat.

486
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,950
Actually, I just stopped
by to return this.

487
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,869
Why, is something
wrong with it?

488
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,871
No, it's lovely,
I just can't accept it.

489
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:52,997
Then I suppose

490
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:56,334
a night of wild,
passionate romance

491
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:58,418
is out of the question?

492
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,296
That's right.

493
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,006
Just thought I'd ask.

494
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,885
(<i> gasps</i> )

495
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,262
Dax must be crazy.

496
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:10,639
Nice view, isn't it?

497
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,058
Don't tell me
the negotiations

498
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,059
are already over.

499
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,560
That's fast work, Quark.

500
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,895
Now, let's see the contract.

501
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,190
There is no contract.

502
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,816
No contract?

503
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,194
But you offered to buy
100,000 vats, didn't you?

504
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:24,195
Yes.

505
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:25,363
And?

506
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:26,697
And that's
when they left.

507
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:27,740
The room?

508
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,782
The station.
What?

509
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,993
I begged them to stay.

510
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,871
This is a catastrophe,
a complete catastrophe.

511
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,623
This was your big chance, Quark,
and you blew it!

512
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,542
You may have
seriously harmed

513
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,544
future Ferengi
opportunities

514
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,962
in the Gamma
Quadrant!

515
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,505
Hold on a minute.

516
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,091
We said we're going
to get you the tulaberries,

517
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:46,842
and that's exactly
what we're going to do.

518
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:47,843
We are?

519
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:48,761
How?

520
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,137
We're going
to travel

521
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,638
to the Gamma Quadrant,
find the Dosi,

522
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,015
and get them
to sign the contract.

523
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,893
And how do you plan
to get there?

524
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:57,519
We'll take your ship.

525
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,812
My ship?

526
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,232
Oh, and I suppose
you expect Maihar'du

527
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:02,358
to pilot it for you.

528
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:03,943
We don't need Maihar'du.

529
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,527
I can pilot
the ship myself.

530
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,904
It's up to you, Nagus.

531
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:09,073
Do you want
those tulaberries or not?

532
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:11,825
All right.

533
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,953
You can use my ship,
but I'm warning you, Quark--

534
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:16,997
either you get the Dosi
to sign that contract,

535
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:21,168
or you'll be tending
that worthless little bar

536
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,836
for the rest of your life!

537
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,309
I've waited
my whole life

538
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,102
for an opportunity
like this.

539
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,938
So have I.

540
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:42,440
So far, it hasn't
turned out

541
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,857
quite the way I planned.

542
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,859
It's not over yet.

543
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,861
I still don't understand
why the Nagus

544
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:50,781
is suddenly insisting
on 100,000 vats.

545
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:53,159
Nor do I.

546
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,827
You don't think
he's purposely trying

547
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,912
to sabotage
the negotiation?

548
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,289
Why would he?

549
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:00,333
I have no idea.

550
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:03,043
Hmm. One thing's
for certain--

551
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,254
he knows more
than he's letting on.

552
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,504
About what?

553
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:07,673
Everything--

554
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,342
the tulaberries,
the Dosi,

555
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:10,384
even the Gamma Quadrant.

556
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:11,844
Well, if you
ever figure out

557
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,720
what he's up to,
make sure you tell me.

558
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,640
Don't worry, I will.

559
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,267
So far, the only thing
I've done right

560
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,269
is pick you
as my consultant.

561
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:23,730
I'm glad
you feel that way.

562
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,861
Now, if we can only
make some profit.

563
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,781
Quark, there's something
you should know.

564
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,074
Oh, you're too late.

565
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,409
I already know what
you're going to say.

566
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:36,327
You do?

567
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:37,370
It's no secret.

568
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,745
It's not?

569
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,831
I admit you've been
a great help to me,

570
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:43,750
but you agreed to a 20%
share of the profits,

571
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,836
and that's all
you're going to get.

572
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:48,130
I see.

573
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,384
Never place friendship
above profit.

574
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:54,220
21st Rule of Acquisition.

575
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,263
I'm glad you agree.

576
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,597
Hmm.

577
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,442
Go, just go!

578
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:09,609
Go!

579
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:13,697
Oh...

580
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,493
Feeling a little
overwhelmed, are we?

581
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:19,161
I'm glad
someone notices.

582
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,496
When's Quark due back?

583
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:21,621
Oh, how should I know?

584
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,416
He never tells me
anything.

585
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,418
He doesn't even bother
to insult me anymore.

586
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:27,002
Go, go.

587
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:30,423
It's Pel, that, that
flabby-eared interloper.

588
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:32,632
He's stealing
my brother's affections.

589
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,134
Hmm, you're better off.

590
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,553
But he's my brother!

591
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:37,971
Would you let someone
steal your brother?

592
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,557
I don't have a brother.

593
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:41,225
Not that I
know of, anyway.

594
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,685
But if you did.

595
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:47,314
Well, I suppose
if I did have a brother,

596
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:50,067
even one as worthless
as Quark,

597
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:53,653
I wouldn't let anyone
come between us.

598

(<i> panting agitatedly</i> )

600
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:37,323
There must be something here
I could use against him.

601
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:40,993
Hmm.

602
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,951
(<i> buzz of conversation</i> )

603
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,411
I've got
controlling interest

604
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,330
so I want to supervise
all operations.

605
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,581
That's ridiculous.

606
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:29,124
Well, then find
another partner.

607
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,584
Let's not be hasty.

608
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,794
I said, no!

609
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:37,757
Are you enjoying yourselves,
little Ferengi?

610
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,635
How could we not?

611
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:42,804
Tell us, Zyree--
what is this place?

612
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:46,600
This-- this is where
opportunities are made.

613
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,477
Really? I thought it
was some kind of party.

614
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:49,853
Then you thought wrong.

615
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,146
This is all about profit.

616
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,648
And like the Ferengi,

617
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:55,693
the Dosi are very serious
when it comes to profit.

618
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:56,860
(<i> phaser shot, male groaning)</i>

619
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,447
You, take him away.

620
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,033
Very serious.

621
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:11,458
Look who finally
showed up.

622
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:17,256
It's about time.

623
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,049
Where are you going?

624
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:20,509
To get serious about profit.

625
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:21,843
Hey, watch it!

626
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:29,727
Oh... it's you,
Ferengi.

627
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:32,354
Aren't you on the wrong
side of the wormhole?

628
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,147
It certainly
feels that way.

629
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,483
Fortunately, all I need
is your thumbscan

630
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,527
on this very
lucrative contract,

631
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:39,986
and I can go home.

632
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,988
You had your chance.

633
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,118
Go away!

634
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,703
Not until we finish
our discussion.

(<i> growls</i> )

636
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:54,293
You... are starting
to annoy me.

637
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,349
Sorry.

638
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:13,270
I should have killed you
back on that station.

639
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,439
But you didn't because
deep down inside,

640
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,941
you recognize a
good opportunity
when you see one.

641
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,944
Just put
your thumbscan here.

642
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:25,865
All right, you can
have the 10,000 vats.

643
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,200
100,000.

644
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,744
I told you before
that's impossible!

645
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,621
100,000, and I'm not
leaving till I get it.

646
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:32,205
Fine.

647
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,415
Then stay.

648
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,418
(<i> groans</i> )

649
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,052
Wouldn't we be
more comfortable

650
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,387
sleeping on the ship?

651
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,014
No, I want to be right here
in case Inglatu

652
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,140
changes his mind.

653
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,850
Don't worry, I don't snore.

654
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,352
Wait!

655
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:54,436
What is it?

656
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:55,813
The mattress.

657
00:30:55,813 --> 00:30:56,855
What about it?

658
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,524
It looks lumpy.

659
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:00,484
Actually, it's very comfortable.

660
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,402
I can't sleep
on a lumpy mattress.

661
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,404
Well, you're in luck, there's
not a lump to be found.

662
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,114
Try it for yourself.

663
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,324
What side do you want?

You're not going to sleep,
are you?

00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:14,456
Why not? I'm tired.

668
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:17,668
Shouldn't we be discussing
rules of strategy?

669
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:19,002
There's nothing to discuss.

670
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,295
But you know

671
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,506
what the 103rd Rule
of Acquisition says.

672
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:23,965
Not offhand.

673
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,467
Sleep can interfere...

674
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,636
And I don't care, either!

First a toast.

To what?

679
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:35,853
To, uh, profit, of course.

Of course.

Is it warm in here?

It must be the wine.

683
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,408
I hope so.

684
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:50,950
I was really impressed

685
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,537
with the way
you handled Inglatu.

686
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,622

wasn't I?

over that barrel.

691
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:04,214
That was risky.

692

The riskier the road,
the greater the profit.

No, definitely not!

Let me give you
some advice--

Inglatu will never
sell you 100,000 vats

because he doesn't want to,

00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,268
but because he can't.

721
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,186
If he can't,
who can? You?

722
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,647
I wish I could,
but there aren't

723
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,649
that many vats
on the entire planet.

724
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:04,900
Then we're finished.

725
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,693
Not necessarily.

726
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,194
If you really want

727
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,322
100,000 vats
of tulaberry wine,

728
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:13,366
I can put you in touch
with the right people.

729
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,368
For a price, of course.

730
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,203
Of course.

731
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:20,874
I always said you were
my favorite Dosi.

732
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:24,085
Now, um, who do we
have to see?

733
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,505
The Karemma.

734
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,674
Who's the Karemma?

735
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:30,008
An important power
in the Dominion.

736
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,511
The Dominion,
what's that?

737
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,847
Let's just say, if you
want to do business

738
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:36,139
in the Gamma Quadrant,

739
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,892
you have to do business
with the Dominion.

740
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,699
"The most profitable
opportunity

741
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:54,783
in Ferengi history"--

742
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,576
that's what
Zek called it,

743
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,704
but he didn't mean
tulaberries, no.

744
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,288
He meant the Dominion.

745
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,541
That's why he sabotaged
negotiations.

746
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,167
He never wanted to do
business with the Dosi.

747
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,335
He just wanted
to use them

748
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:06,628
to get to a more
important member

749
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:07,629
of the Dominion!

750
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:08,881
Quark, we need to talk.

751
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:10,173
We are talking.

752
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,801
Don't you want to know
why I kissed you?

753
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,636
You never kissed me.

754
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:15,679
Yes, I did.

755
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,096
No, you didn't,

756
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,974
and I don't want to
discuss it anymore.

757
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:20,726
Let's just concentrate
on the Dominion.

758
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:23,687
I only wish Zyree
would have told us more.

759
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:26,064
Maybe it's some
planetary alliance

760
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,233
or trading consortium.

761
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:31,194
Whatever it is,
it's important,

762
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:34,239
and I want
a piece of it.

763
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,661
Quark, I'm very disappointed.

764
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:41,413
I really wanted
those tulaberries.

765
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:42,789
You and I both
know my trip

766
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,123
had nothing to do
with tulaberries.

767
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,291
It didn't?

768
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,543
I must speak
with you, Brother.

769
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,086
Can't you see
I'm busy?

770
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:52,131
Does the word "Dominion"
mean anything to you?

771
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,091
What have you found out?

772
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,217
You first.

773
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,343
Please, Brother,
it's urgent.

774
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,302
Not now!

775
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:57,512
I'm waiting.

776
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,057
Well, most of
my information consists

777
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:02,601
of little more
than hints and whispers,

778
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,519
but it's enough
to convince me

779
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,480
that whoever learns
the secret of the Dominion,

780
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,025
whatever that may be,
will learn the secret

781
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,568
of the Gamma Quadrant.

782
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:14,780
Unfortunately, the Dosi
don't seem to know very much.

783
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,908
I was hoping they'd lead
us to someone who does.

784
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:20,368
What would such information
be worth to you?

785
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,494
A lot.

786
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,913
What if I

787
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:25,248
told you I could
arrange a meeting

788
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:28,418
between you and a powerful
member of the Dominion?

789
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:30,837
If you can do that,
I'll see to it

790
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:34,466
that you earn a percentage
of every Ferengi opportunity

791
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,802
in the Gamma Quadrant.

792
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:38,887
Ah...

793
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:41,890
that's a lot of latinum.

794
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,935
Give me... a name.

795
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:47,771
The Karemma.

796
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:50,107
The Karemma.

797
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:54,903
I always knew you had
the lobes for business.

798
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,696
(<i> guffaws</i> )

799
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,032
Now may I speak
with you, Brother?

800
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:01,159
All right, but
make it quick.

801
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:37,487
(<i> whimpering</i> )

802
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:38,864
Easy, now.

803
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:40,365
That's quite a bump
you've got there.

804
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,449
Where's Rom?

805
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,701
Right here, Brother.

806
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,285
Luckily, there
doesn't seem to be

807
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,328
any serious damage.

808
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,913
Uh, if you don't mind,

809
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,749
I'd like to rest here
for a few minutes.

810
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,417
Of course.

811
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,086
I'll be in the other
room if you need me.

812
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:54,379
Thank you, Doctor.

813
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,258
You haven't told
anybody, have you?

814
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,760
You mean about Pel?

815
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,720
Quiet.

816
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,555
I haven't
breathed a word.

817
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,807
I thought it'd be best
if you told Zek yourself.

818
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,308
Nobody's going to tell Zek
anything, is that clear?

819
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,144
But she's a female...

820
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,770
Not so loud.

821
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,398
Who wears clothes and is
trying to earn profit.

822
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:14,691
Why, she even quotes

823
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:17,110
from the sacred Rules
of Acquisition.

824
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,696
Such a female must be
severely punished.

825
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:20,655
I know that.

826
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,032
Then we'll stop her.

827
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:23,616
No.

828
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,244
You're scaring me,
Brother.

829
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,498
Could it be you have
feelings for this woman?

830
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,084
Of course not.

831
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:33,793
Don't you see?

832
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:37,172
If Zek learns that I've
been deceived by a female,

833
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:38,256
I'd be ruined.

834
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,883
He'd never
trust me again.

835
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:42,177
But if you<i> don't</i> tell
him and he finds out,

836
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:43,678
you're<i> certain</i>
to be ruined.

837
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,347
You<i> have</i> to tell
him, or I will.

838
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,433
Let me go.

839
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,309
I have to save you
from yourself.

840
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,603
Forget about me.
What about the bar?

841
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,230
The bar?

842
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,480
You still want it,
don't you?

843
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,357
Don't you?

844
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,525
Who needs the bar

845
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,860
when I can have
the Gamma Quadrant?

846
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,320
I'll transfer
ownership immediately,

847
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,906
but only on
one condition--

848
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:07,744
that you never
mention the truth
about Pel to anyone.

849
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:09,370
Pel?

850
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,330
W-W-What about him?

851
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,000
(<i> both chuckling</i> )

852
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,418
Yeah.

853
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,963
(<i> door chimes</i> )
Come.

854
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:24,844
Where are your lobes?

855
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:27,555
Over there.

856
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,682
Well, put them on
before somebody sees you.

857
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:33,352
No one's going to see me.

858
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:36,064
Put them on.

859
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:37,440
Now.

860
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,484
And wrap yourself up.

861
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,365
Have you finished packing?

862
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,993
Am I going
somewhere?

863
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:50,495
As far away from this station
as possible.

864
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,080
But you need
me, Quark.

865
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,249
I'm the only one
you can trust.

866
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,834
Not anymore.

867
00:38:58,128 --> 00:39:01,089
Well, what did you expect?

868
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:03,300
I mean, look at you.

869
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,802
You're wearing clothes.

870
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:06,886
Is that a crime?

871
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,471
As a matter
of fact, it is.

872
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:12,017
Look, it's just too risky
for you to stay here.

873
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:14,060
And you can take
this with you.

874
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,228
What is it?

875
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:16,729
Ten bars of latinum.

876
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,898
To help you
start a new life.

877
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:23,195
If you're going to
pretend you're a man,

878
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:24,279
act like one.

879
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,488
Take the profit.

880
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,782
This is not about
profit anymore.

881
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:28,867
It's about love!

882
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:31,911
Oh, spoken like
a true female.

883
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,955
I love you, Quark,

884
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,540
and I know you care
about me, too.

885
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,791
Admit it!

886
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,793
What difference
does it make if I do?

887
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,920
You'd never be happy
being a Ferengi wife.

888
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,589
Then come with me
to the Gamma Quadrant.

889
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,967
No one there cares if
I wear clothes or not.

890
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,804
I'd care.

891
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,895
Then I guess
I'd better start packing.

892
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,984
I guess so.

893
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:10,033
Mmm... mmm... mmm.

894
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,326
(<i> crunching</i> )

895
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,161
Mmm... mmm...

896
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:14,746
Mmm!

897
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,543
Mmm.

898
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:24,672
These flaked blood fleas
are surprisingly succulent.

899
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,466
Mm-hmm, you really should
try them, Brother-- mmm...

900
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,844
I'm not feeling
particularly hungry.

901
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,346
Let me guess.

902
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:33,139
Too busy thinking
about how to spend

903
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,934
all that latinum
we're going to earn?

904
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,602
Well, I don't blame you.

905
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:38,561
(<i> door chimes</i> )

906
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,645
Come.

907
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,154
I thought you said
she left the station!

908
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,572
I thought she did.

909
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,408
I hope you don't mind, Quark,

910
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:54,244
but I couldn't leave without
saying good-bye to the Nagus.

911
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:56,495
I'm glad you stopped by.

912
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:57,622
I know how much
you helped Quark

913
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,291
during the negotiations.

914
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,709
I predict a big
future for you, Pel.

915
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,503
You certainly have
the lobes for it.

916
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,216
So, you like my lobes?

917
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,717
Pel...

918
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,386
Yes, I do.

919
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:13,221
Good, then you
can have them!

920
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:14,264
No!

921
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:15,473
(<i> screams</i> )

922
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,766
It's a female!

923
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:18,226
Does this mean
I don't get the bar?

924
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:19,936
Rom... out.

925
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:21,938
Quark, this is outrageous!

926
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:23,231
Now what's going on here?

927
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:24,232
I-I-I...

928
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:25,483
Leave him out of this!

929
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,444
You dare give<i> me</i> orders?

930
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:29,195
You knew about this all along,
didn't you?

931
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,363
I...

932
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:32,949
So tell me more
about my big future.

933
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:34,993
You have no future.

934
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:38,746
I'll see to it that you spend
the rest of your life in prison.

935
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:39,998
No.

936
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,624
Let me
remind you

937
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,419
that taking business advice
from a female

938
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,338
is a violation of Ferengi law.

939
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:48,465
I didn't know she was a female.

940
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:50,467
Stupidity is no excuse.

941
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:51,926
Now, one more word out of you,

942
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,928
and you are going
to share her cell.

943
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,348
Then, you better make sure
it's big enough for three.

944
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:57,598
Are you threatening me?

945
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,309
I wonder
what your associates will say

946
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:02,854
when I tell them you allowed
a female to represent you

947
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,063
in a business negotiation.

948
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,690
I didn't know
she was a female.

949
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,775
Stupidity is no excuse.

950
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,322
I see your point.

951
00:42:12,322 --> 00:42:14,324
It seems that Pel's identity

952
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:16,951
will have to remain
our little secret,

953
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,120
but it's going to cost you.

954
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,332
My Gamma Quadrant profits.

955
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:25,960
I've always said you were
a bright fellow, Quark.

956
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:33,801
Shame on you!

957
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:41,684
I hope you're satisfied.

958
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:54,280
I'm sorry...

959
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,823
but it's time
you learned

960
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,700
that when it comes
to accumulating profit,

961
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,827
women are as
capable as men.

962
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:04,290
Well, do me a favor and
don't tell anybody else.

963
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,880
I should go.

964
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,509
I've booked passage on
an Andorian transport.

965
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:17,345
You could come with me.

966
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,723
I can't.

967
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,684
I know.

968
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:36,697
Well, then, I guess
if I can't have you,

969
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:40,159
I'll take those ten bars
of latinum after all.

970
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,494
(<i> groans</i> )

971
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:44,539
(<i> sighs</i> )

972
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:48,042
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

973
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:56,884
So, Lieutenant...

974
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,637
you ready for another
night of<i> tongo?</i>

975
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,973
Haven't you lost enough
for one day?

976
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:03,682
I don't know what
you're talking about.

977
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:05,893
I'm talking about Pel.

978
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:09,021
She came by to see me
before she left.

979
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,523
I'm going to miss her.

980
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:12,191
So are you.

981
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:15,361
You really think I'd let
anyone come between us?

982
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,530
Nice try, Quark,

983
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,491
but I know you
better than that.

984
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,084
(<i> sighs</i> )
