1
00:00:05,335 --> 00:00:06,667
All right, Morn.

2
00:00:06,705 --> 00:00:07,695
You know the rules.

3
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:09,335
No sleeping on the Promenade.

4
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:10,367
Go home.

5
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:37,262
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

6
00:01:03,919 --> 00:01:06,755
The risk is to you, Lieutenant.

7
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:09,730
I could probably think better
without your hand on my thigh.

8
00:01:09,765 --> 00:01:12,430
Now, how did that get there?

9
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,737
So, uh, what's it going to be?

10
00:01:16,779 --> 00:01:19,410
Confront, evade,
acquire, retreat...

11
00:01:21,287 --> 00:01:22,448
Confront.

12
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,259
Yes!

13
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,267
Doesn't she ever lose?

14
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:29,269
Tell me, Lieutenant

15
00:01:29,303 --> 00:01:31,273
how'd you get to be
so good at <i>tongo?</i>

16
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,005
Actually, it was Curzon
who played it all the time.

17
00:01:34,046 --> 00:01:35,446
Well, that explains it.

18
00:01:35,482 --> 00:01:38,283
It's Curzon who's beating
us... not this female.

19
00:01:38,388 --> 00:01:40,585
This female happens
to be a better player

20
00:01:40,626 --> 00:01:41,753
than Curzon ever was.

21
00:01:41,795 --> 00:01:43,127
And a prettier one, too.

22
00:01:43,164 --> 00:01:46,968
Maybe so, but I still
prefer a Ferengi female...

23
00:01:47,005 --> 00:01:49,134
one who never wears clothes

24
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:50,474
never talks back

25
00:01:50,512 --> 00:01:52,311
and never plays <i>tongo!</i>

26
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:55,014
Is that really how you
prefer your women...

27
00:01:55,055 --> 00:01:56,421
naked and submissive?

28
00:01:56,457 --> 00:01:58,893
You find such a lifestyle
appealing?

29
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:00,922
Ah, don't you wish?

30
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:04,371
I do, I really do.

31
00:02:04,406 --> 00:02:05,533
All right.

32
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:07,704
The opening risk is
at five strips of latinum.

33
00:02:07,747 --> 00:02:08,908
The purchase is at three

34
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:09,939
the sell is at eight.

35
00:02:10,953 --> 00:02:11,943
Absolutely not.

36
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:14,016
This isn't the proper time!

37
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:16,256
I'm trying to concentrate.

38
00:02:16,297 --> 00:02:17,595
I'm sorry, Brother.

39
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:19,296
It's this insolent
young waiter's fault.

40
00:02:19,336 --> 00:02:20,304
My apologies, Quark

41
00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:22,308
but I really think
you should try this.

42
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:23,742
What is it?

43
00:02:23,779 --> 00:02:25,305
A way to double
your beverage profits.

44
00:02:25,348 --> 00:02:26,373
Taste it.

45
00:02:32,897 --> 00:02:33,990
You see, just as I told you.

46
00:02:34,033 --> 00:02:35,467
He immediately
reached for his drink.

47
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:36,731
So I did.

48
00:02:42,917 --> 00:02:43,885
Amazing.

49
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,584
You don't even
realize you're thirsty.

50
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,614
What are they?

51
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:49,356
Gramilian sand peas.

52
00:02:49,463 --> 00:02:51,626
They inhibit the secretion
of the salivary glands

53
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:53,967
while drying out
the tissues of the tongue.

54
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:55,474
It works every time.

55
00:02:57,012 --> 00:02:58,037
If you replace

56
00:02:58,081 --> 00:03:00,381
your complimentary
dishes of <i>lokar</i> beans

57
00:03:00,418 --> 00:03:02,718
with Gramilian sand peas,
you won't be able

58
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:05,250
to fill your customers'
glasses fast enough.

59
00:03:05,295 --> 00:03:06,558
What's your name again?

60
00:03:06,597 --> 00:03:07,656
Pel.

61
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,570
So, what do you think
about my idea?

62
00:03:10,605 --> 00:03:13,075
I think I agree with
the 59th Rule of Acquisition.

63
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:15,206
Free advice is seldom cheap.

64
00:03:15,248 --> 00:03:17,947
True, but the 22nd Rule says

65
00:03:17,987 --> 00:03:20,720
a wise man can hear
profit in the wind.

66
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,058
I see you know your Rules.

67
00:03:22,095 --> 00:03:24,965
All 285 of them

68
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:27,837
and the various commentaries
on them, as well.

69
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,539
I don't plan on being
a waiter forever.

70
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:32,707
Good, then you're fired.

71
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,718
Shut up, Rom.

72
00:03:33,752 --> 00:03:35,220
When it comes to business

73
00:03:35,255 --> 00:03:38,250
my brother has the weak
little lobes of a female.

74
00:03:38,294 --> 00:03:41,494
So, uh, what made you take
a job here at the station?

75
00:03:41,534 --> 00:03:44,734
I wanted to learn
from the very best.

76
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:48,235
Uh-huh, which brings to mind
the 33rd Rule of Acquisition.

77
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:50,912
It never hurts
to suck up to the boss.

78
00:03:55,562 --> 00:03:56,655
What's that?

79
00:03:56,697 --> 00:04:00,262
The Grand Nagus Zek's
personal subspace frequency.

80
00:04:00,305 --> 00:04:02,366
I wonder what he wants.

81
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:05,912
Why do you look so surprised?

82
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,384
I told you I'd be back.

83
00:04:07,452 --> 00:04:09,547
Uh, I've looked forward
to your return, Nagus.

84
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,587
Still the perfect
little toady, eh, Quark?

85
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:14,599
I try to be.

86
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:16,033
Then listen carefully.

87
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,837
The Ferengi expansion
into the Gamma Quadrant

88
00:04:18,876 --> 00:04:19,969
is about to begin.

89
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:22,447
I'd like you to be
my chief negotiator.

90
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:24,646
Me?

91
00:04:24,686 --> 00:04:26,212
That's right.

92
00:04:26,257 --> 00:04:28,420
I'm offering you an opportunity

93
00:04:28,528 --> 00:04:31,728
to make more profit
than you ever dreamed of.

94
00:04:31,767 --> 00:04:33,930
All you have to do is earn it.

95
00:06:35,505 --> 00:06:38,272
Can I interest you
in some Hupyrian beetle snuff?

96
00:06:38,378 --> 00:06:39,277
I don't think so.

97
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,075
Major?

98
00:06:40,115 --> 00:06:41,083
No, thank you.

99
00:06:41,117 --> 00:06:43,280
Well, suit yourself.

100
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:44,915
More for me.

101
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,913
Little late, aren't we?

102
00:07:02,994 --> 00:07:05,260
So you wanted
to see me, Commander?

103
00:07:05,365 --> 00:07:06,994
I understand you're
planning to host

104
00:07:07,036 --> 00:07:09,006
a business conference
here at the station.

105
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,479
Yes, with the Dosi,
a race from the Gamma Quadrant.

106
00:07:12,513 --> 00:07:14,642
A very profitable
opportunity for all concerned

107
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,709
I might add.

108
00:07:15,752 --> 00:07:17,813
Profitable for the Ferengi,
maybe.

109
00:07:17,856 --> 00:07:20,088
Are you implying something,
Major?

110
00:07:20,128 --> 00:07:21,528
Me?
Not at all, no.

111
00:07:21,564 --> 00:07:24,593
The Ferengi reputation
speaks for itself.

112
00:07:24,637 --> 00:07:28,941
A reputation for honesty
and decency and reliability.

113
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,507
You always know what to expect

114
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,521
when you do business
with the Ferengi.

115
00:07:33,555 --> 00:07:35,684
Which is why, if you're smart

116
00:07:35,726 --> 00:07:37,320
you don't do business
with the Ferengi.

117
00:07:37,429 --> 00:07:39,422
I think you've made
your point, Major.

118
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:42,303
As misinformed and misguided
as it may be.

119
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:46,143
Besides, how we do business
is no concern of yours.

120
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,480
Except when you conduct
your business on this station.

121
00:07:48,518 --> 00:07:51,581
In other words, Zek,
Grand Nagus or no Grand Nagus

122
00:07:51,624 --> 00:07:54,187
if we allow you to hold
your negotiations here

123
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,700
and we find out
you're cheating the Dosi

124
00:07:56,734 --> 00:08:00,504
I'll see to it you never
set foot on this station again.

125
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:03,673
Did anyone ever tell you
your eyes shine

126
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:07,485
with the brilliance
of Kibberian fire diamonds?

127
00:08:07,523 --> 00:08:08,957
Not that I recall.

128
00:08:08,993 --> 00:08:10,758
Well, they do.

129
00:08:10,796 --> 00:08:15,134
So, tell me, Major,
could Bajor use

130
00:08:15,172 --> 00:08:19,203
50,000 kilos of brizeen nitrate?

131
00:08:20,515 --> 00:08:22,382
Of course, we could.

132
00:08:23,388 --> 00:08:25,255
With that much brizeen,
we could fertilize

133
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:27,159
the entire northern peninsula.

134
00:08:27,196 --> 00:08:29,793
Well, I've recently
come into possession

135
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:32,031
of 50,000 kilos
of brizeen nitrate

136
00:08:32,072 --> 00:08:37,174
and to show you how much
your cooperation means to me

137
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:40,917
I'll let you have
the entire shipment.

138
00:08:42,926 --> 00:08:44,589
I'll still need your assurances

139
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,566
that the Dosi will
be fairly treated

140
00:08:46,601 --> 00:08:47,591
while they're here.

141
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:49,367
You have my word.

142
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:50,567
Good.

143
00:08:50,609 --> 00:08:51,599
Then, it's settled.

144
00:08:53,047 --> 00:08:55,210
Now, let's see...

145
00:08:55,252 --> 00:09:00,251
50,000 kilos at, uh,
25% of our usual price.

146
00:09:00,295 --> 00:09:03,131
25%? You just said
you were giving it to them.

147
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,137
Well, you're right, Commander.

148
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:06,765
We're all friends here.

149
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:09,870
So, I'll let you
have it at cost.

150
00:09:09,914 --> 00:09:12,248
I have a better idea.

151
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:13,812
Why not consider the nitrate

152
00:09:13,855 --> 00:09:15,722
as a gift
to the people of Bajor?

153
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:17,388
A gift?

154
00:09:17,496 --> 00:09:19,898
That doesn't sound
very profitable.

155
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,300
It depends.

156
00:09:21,337 --> 00:09:22,498
On what?

157
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:26,274
On whether you want
to conduct business here or not.

158
00:09:27,749 --> 00:09:34,058
Your negotiating skills
aren't bad for a hu-man.

159
00:09:34,096 --> 00:09:38,264
Your nitrate will be
delivered promptly.

160
00:09:38,304 --> 00:09:43,303
Anything else you need,
come see me personally.

161
00:09:50,261 --> 00:09:51,729
Well, Quark, I've been involved

162
00:09:51,764 --> 00:09:54,793
in some very profitable
opportunities in my time

163
00:09:54,837 --> 00:09:56,704
but my lobes are telling me

164
00:09:56,741 --> 00:10:01,182
that this may be
the most profitable opportunity

165
00:10:01,217 --> 00:10:03,687
in Ferengi history.

166
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:04,689
Imagine that.

167
00:10:04,723 --> 00:10:06,716
And part of those profits
will be mine.

168
00:10:06,761 --> 00:10:08,731
Profit, fame, power...

169
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:10,496
as much as you want.

170
00:10:10,602 --> 00:10:14,372
Tell me, uh, Nagus, what exactly
is this great opportunity?

171
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,507
I can sum it up in one word...
tulaberries.

172
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:18,880
Tulaberries?

173
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,113
Exactly.

174
00:10:20,155 --> 00:10:21,350
Go on.

175
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,055
Well, they're the main
ingredient in tulaberry wine.

176
00:10:24,095 --> 00:10:29,231
Your job will be to purchase
10,000 vats from the Dosi.

177
00:10:29,273 --> 00:10:30,970
We're going
into the wine business?

178
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:33,537
Within a single year,
we'll have made tulaberry wine

179
00:10:33,648 --> 00:10:36,984
the most popular drink
in their entire sector.

180
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:38,080
That's enough!

181
00:10:40,962 --> 00:10:43,991
Oh, I like it...
very distinguished.

182
00:10:44,035 --> 00:10:48,135
Tell me, Nagus...
how are tulaberries going to be

183
00:10:48,177 --> 00:10:50,774
the most profitable opportunity
in Ferengi history?

184
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:52,978
Do I have to spell it out
for you?

185
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,818
If you don't mind.

186
00:10:54,857 --> 00:10:55,847
Tulaberries

187
00:10:55,892 --> 00:10:58,294
will establish
a Ferengi presence

188
00:10:58,331 --> 00:11:00,324
inside the Gamma Quadrant.

189
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:04,433
And once we get our foot
in the door

190
00:11:04,476 --> 00:11:07,243
they'll never get it out.

191
00:11:07,282 --> 00:11:09,947
Yes, I see!

192
00:11:09,987 --> 00:11:15,556
Tulaberries, Quark, tulaberries.

193
00:11:15,665 --> 00:11:17,396
Tulaberries.

194
00:11:17,435 --> 00:11:18,562
I wonder what they taste like.

195
00:11:18,604 --> 00:11:20,095
Who cares what they taste like?

196
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,303
They're an opportunity
to get a Ferengi foot

197
00:11:22,345 --> 00:11:23,574
in the Gamma Quadrant door.

198
00:11:23,681 --> 00:11:25,674
And it'll be your foot, Brother.

199
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:26,686
I'm so proud.

200
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,986
I'm going to make history, Rom

201
00:11:29,025 --> 00:11:30,858
and I'm going to be rich.

202
00:11:30,895 --> 00:11:34,163
And I have the Grand Nagus
to thank for it.

203
00:11:34,203 --> 00:11:35,900
He must really like me.

204
00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:37,704
Just remember one thing...

205
00:11:37,742 --> 00:11:41,010
the bigger the smile,
the sharper the knife.

206
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:43,349
48th Rule of Acquisition.

207
00:11:43,387 --> 00:11:44,355
He has some nerve.

208
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:46,052
I warned you about that fellow.

209
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:49,155
Pel, do you mind telling me
what you meant just now?

210
00:11:49,198 --> 00:11:50,997
Did you ever think
about why the Nagus

211
00:11:51,035 --> 00:11:53,632
has put you in charge
of such a lucrative opportunity?

212
00:11:53,674 --> 00:11:54,642
Isn't it obvious?

213
00:11:54,676 --> 00:11:56,475
He knows I have
the lobes for business.

214
00:11:56,513 --> 00:11:57,981
That's only part of it.

215
00:11:58,016 --> 00:11:58,984
I refuse to stand here

216
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,418
and allow my brother
to be insulted.

217
00:12:00,455 --> 00:12:01,423
You're fired.

218
00:12:01,457 --> 00:12:02,584
Shut up!

219
00:12:02,626 --> 00:12:03,594
Go on.

220
00:12:03,628 --> 00:12:05,564
If the negotiations
are profitable

221
00:12:05,598 --> 00:12:08,263
then the Nagus becomes
the greatest hero ever

222
00:12:08,304 --> 00:12:09,272
but if they fail

223
00:12:09,306 --> 00:12:11,435
he's going to need
someone to take the blame.

224
00:12:11,477 --> 00:12:12,775
You mean me?

225
00:12:12,812 --> 00:12:16,307
All I'm saying is, be careful.

226
00:12:17,856 --> 00:12:19,051
I never heard
such ridiculous lies.

227
00:12:19,091 --> 00:12:21,584
He's just jealous
of your success, Brother.

228
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,598
No, he's right.

229
00:12:22,632 --> 00:12:24,829
If something goes wrong,
it'll be my fault.

230
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,999
Then you're going
to need help, Brother.

231
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,100
Yes!

232
00:12:28,143 --> 00:12:29,634
Someone to serve
as your consultant

233
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,648
during negotiations.

234
00:12:30,715 --> 00:12:31,648
Yes!

235
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:32,650
Someone like me.

236
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:33,652
No.

237
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:36,625
Uh, I've been thinking
about what you just said

238
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,062
and, uh, I probably
could use some help

239
00:12:39,098 --> 00:12:40,658
during these negotiations.

240
00:12:40,702 --> 00:12:41,670
I accept.

241
00:12:41,704 --> 00:12:42,672
Good.

242
00:12:42,706 --> 00:12:43,799
Then we're partners.

243
00:12:43,841 --> 00:12:46,277
Not quite...
I don't need a partner.

244
00:12:46,313 --> 00:12:47,873
I need an assistant.

245
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,148
All right, but I get 25%
of everything you make.

246
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:51,155
Fifteen.

247
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:52,157
Twenty.

248
00:12:52,191 --> 00:12:53,250
Done.

249
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:55,389
But, Brother,
what can I do to help?

250
00:12:55,431 --> 00:12:57,025
You want to help?

251
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,060
Table six is waiting.

252
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,673
How do I look?

253
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,110
Nervous.

254
00:14:18,146 --> 00:14:19,136
Who, me?

255
00:14:19,248 --> 00:14:21,150
What have I got
to be nervous about?

256
00:14:21,219 --> 00:14:22,813
Yeah, it's Zek
who should be nervous...

257
00:14:22,856 --> 00:14:24,951
with Quark here
as his chief negotiator.

258
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:28,299
If you ever do that again...

259
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,301
Do what?

260
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,861
If you ever do that again

261
00:14:30,905 --> 00:14:33,137
I'll stick those 50,000 kilos
of brizeen right up your...

262
00:14:33,176 --> 00:14:34,576
Here they come!

263
00:14:37,786 --> 00:14:42,284
Don't worry,
just a minor disagreement.

264
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:58,018
So, uh, can I get anyone
something to eat?

265
00:14:59,463 --> 00:15:00,556
All right.

266
00:15:00,598 --> 00:15:03,034
Um, in that case,
let's go over our offer.

267
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,734
As you know, the Ferengi
are interested in purchasing

268
00:15:05,775 --> 00:15:07,836
10,000 vats
of tulaberry wine.

269
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:10,179
In exchange,
the Dosi will receive

270
00:15:10,217 --> 00:15:13,280
what I consider to be
a very fair trade package.

271
00:15:13,323 --> 00:15:15,657
There are some very interesting
items on that list...

272
00:15:15,695 --> 00:15:16,890
a subspace field modulator

273
00:15:16,931 --> 00:15:18,491
uh, some optical
data processors...

274
00:15:18,534 --> 00:15:21,131
We'll give you 5,000 vats.

275
00:15:21,172 --> 00:15:23,199
I'm afraid that won't be enough.

276
00:15:23,243 --> 00:15:26,215
Um, we're looking to establish
a vast distribution network

277
00:15:26,316 --> 00:15:27,784
in the Gamma Quadrant.

278
00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:29,789
We'll need at least 10,000 vats.

279
00:15:29,823 --> 00:15:32,055
I'm offering you 5,000 vats.

280
00:15:32,094 --> 00:15:33,825
I suggest you take it.

281
00:15:33,864 --> 00:15:35,390
The Nagus will never agree.

282
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,666
This is a waste of time.

283
00:15:37,706 --> 00:15:39,642
We should be talking
directly to Zek.

284
00:15:39,676 --> 00:15:41,042
I know we should
be talking to Zek.

285
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:45,213
Then why do you bother talking
to this insignificance?

286
00:15:45,253 --> 00:15:46,448
Now, see what you've done?

287
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,788
What?

288
00:15:47,826 --> 00:15:49,352
You've made me look foolish.

289
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:51,490
I didn't mean to.

290
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,728
Then bring us Zek.

291
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:54,032
The Nagus has asked

292
00:15:54,071 --> 00:15:55,802
Quark to represent him
during these negotiations.

293
00:15:55,842 --> 00:15:57,140
Are you implying

294
00:15:57,177 --> 00:15:59,670
that Zek is too important
to negotiate with us?!

295
00:15:59,716 --> 00:16:01,345
We never meant to imply
anything of the sort.

296
00:16:01,386 --> 00:16:04,222
Because, if we kill you

297
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:08,231
Zek will have to talk to us.

298
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,328
You want to do business
with the Ferengi

299
00:16:11,372 --> 00:16:12,806
you talk to Quark.

300
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,958
So how about it?

301
00:16:20,992 --> 00:16:22,655
Do we say 10,000 vats?

302
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:28,866
We'll think about it.

303
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,726
Can I help you?

304
00:16:47,277 --> 00:16:48,370
What is it?

305
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,451
It's beautiful.

306
00:16:56,496 --> 00:16:57,896
It's latinum.

307
00:16:57,932 --> 00:17:00,232
Excuse me,
I really can't accept this.

308
00:17:02,374 --> 00:17:03,273
Did Zek really think

309
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:04,708
this was going
to get him anywhere?

310
00:17:04,746 --> 00:17:05,907
Probably not.

311
00:17:05,948 --> 00:17:08,886
But it doesn't stop
a Ferengi from trying.

312
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:11,414
You sound like you
admire them for it.

313
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:14,431
I suppose, in a way, I do.

314
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:17,904
I don't understand your attitude
about the Ferengi.

315
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:19,568
That's because you don't

316
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:21,806
socialize with them
the way I do.

317
00:17:21,847 --> 00:17:23,840
Looking back
over seven lifetimes

318
00:17:23,884 --> 00:17:27,084
I can't think of a single
race I've enjoyed more.

319
00:17:27,124 --> 00:17:30,996
Did anyone ever tell you
you have very strange taste?

320
00:17:31,032 --> 00:17:34,163
I admit, they place
too much emphasis on profit

321
00:17:34,205 --> 00:17:37,200
and their behavior towards
women is somewhat primitive...

322
00:17:37,244 --> 00:17:40,775
They're greedy, misogynistic,
untrustworthy little trolls

323
00:17:40,818 --> 00:17:43,619
and I wouldn't turn my back
on one of them for a second.

324
00:17:43,657 --> 00:17:44,886
Neither would I.

325
00:17:44,926 --> 00:17:46,360
But once you accept that

326
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:48,831
you'll find
they can be a lot of fun.

327
00:17:59,689 --> 00:18:01,454
Evade.

328
00:18:03,363 --> 00:18:04,889
Evade.

329
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:06,060
Retreat.

330
00:18:06,102 --> 00:18:07,536
Acquire.

331
00:18:07,571 --> 00:18:08,971
Confront.

332
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,511
Did I say "acquire"?

333
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:14,983
I meant "evade."

334
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,352
You said "acquire."

335
00:18:16,455 --> 00:18:17,855
Well, I meant "evade"!

336
00:18:17,892 --> 00:18:19,657
Why don't we just
play the round over?

337
00:18:19,696 --> 00:18:20,959
That sounds fair.

338
00:18:20,998 --> 00:18:22,193
Who asked you?

339
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:23,725
And shouldn't you
be plotting strategy

340
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:24,932
for tomorrow's negotiations?

341
00:18:24,973 --> 00:18:25,941
Believe me, Nagus

342
00:18:25,975 --> 00:18:27,877
I've thought of nothing
else all evening.

343
00:18:27,912 --> 00:18:29,711
That must be why
you're losing so badly.

344
00:18:29,749 --> 00:18:33,484
And I think, by tomorrow,
we should have an agreement.

345
00:18:33,523 --> 00:18:35,493
Well, I've been thinking, too

346
00:18:35,527 --> 00:18:38,761
and 10,000 vats
of tulaberry wine aren't enough.

347
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:39,894
Tell them we want 100,000.

348
00:18:39,936 --> 00:18:41,302
100,000?

349
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:44,743
But I'm not sure they'll even
agree to sell us 10,000.

350
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:48,412
100,000 vats would mean
more profit for them and for us.

351
00:18:48,453 --> 00:18:49,614
Now, do as I say!

352
00:18:49,656 --> 00:18:52,355
Or I'm going to take over
the negotiations myself.

353
00:18:52,394 --> 00:18:56,232
I think raising the stakes
is a brilliant idea.

354
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,327
You do?

355
00:18:57,371 --> 00:18:59,739
It'll show the Gamma Quadrant
we mean business.

356
00:18:59,776 --> 00:19:02,144
No wonder Quark says
you're a genius.

357
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,241
Oh, he says that, does he?

358
00:19:04,284 --> 00:19:06,220
All the time.

359
00:19:06,255 --> 00:19:07,280
That's very touching.

360
00:19:07,324 --> 00:19:08,724
Now bring me
some fresh tube grubs.

361
00:19:08,761 --> 00:19:10,321
These are losing their crunch.

362
00:19:10,363 --> 00:19:12,060
Right away.

363
00:19:14,204 --> 00:19:18,839
So, I believe the next challenge
goes to you.

364
00:19:18,881 --> 00:19:21,876
I think I'll pass on this round.

365
00:19:24,491 --> 00:19:27,088
Such loyalty must be expensive.

366
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,125
You can't buy
that kind of loyalty.

367
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,108
You can where I come from.

368
00:19:34,244 --> 00:19:36,578
Is the Nagus always
this impatient?

369
00:19:36,615 --> 00:19:39,815
He wants results
and he expects me to get them.

370
00:19:39,856 --> 00:19:42,419
But he's not making
my job any easier.

371
00:19:42,461 --> 00:19:45,456
100,000 vats...
that's a lot of tulaberries.

372
00:19:45,533 --> 00:19:47,001
You'll get them.

373
00:19:47,037 --> 00:19:48,096
How can you be so sure?

374
00:19:48,139 --> 00:19:49,471
Because you're good

375
00:19:49,575 --> 00:19:52,877
and with me helping you,
you're even better.

376
00:19:52,915 --> 00:19:55,887
Why are you being so nice to me?

377
00:19:55,921 --> 00:19:58,357
For 20% of your profits.

378
00:19:58,392 --> 00:19:59,382
Why else?

379
00:20:00,865 --> 00:20:02,231
Fair enough.

380
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:04,430
Quark, where are my grubs?

381
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:05,837
Coming.

382
00:20:08,045 --> 00:20:11,644
Mmm. Now this is
what I call fresh.

383
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:20,031
I didn't know the Replimat
had a Ferengi menu.

384
00:20:20,069 --> 00:20:21,037
It doesn't.

385
00:20:21,071 --> 00:20:22,471
I like to try new things.

386
00:20:22,507 --> 00:20:24,409
That's unusual for a Ferengi.

387
00:20:24,444 --> 00:20:27,314
I never heard of a Trill
who could play <i>tongo.</i>

388
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,878
I guess that makes
us both unusual.

389
00:20:29,923 --> 00:20:31,186
You know, I was impressed

390
00:20:31,225 --> 00:20:33,491
by your show of loyalty
to Quark last night.

391
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:35,897
He deserves it.

392
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,301
That's not the point.

393
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:40,798
Any other Ferengi would've let
Zek pick him to pieces.

394
00:20:40,844 --> 00:20:44,477
But you're not like
any other Ferengi I've ever met.

395
00:20:44,518 --> 00:20:46,681
Quark really likes you.

396
00:20:46,722 --> 00:20:49,819
He talks about you all the time.

397
00:20:49,862 --> 00:20:51,889
You know he once convinced me

398
00:20:51,933 --> 00:20:54,267
to go up to a holosuite
with him?

399
00:20:54,304 --> 00:20:55,602
Turns out, he recreated

400
00:20:55,707 --> 00:20:57,768
the bedroom I slept in
as a child.

401
00:20:57,812 --> 00:21:00,180
He overheard me
describing it to Kira.

402
00:21:00,216 --> 00:21:02,243
Of course, most of the details
were wrong

403
00:21:02,287 --> 00:21:03,916
but it was
a very sweet gesture...

404
00:21:03,957 --> 00:21:05,391
up until he tried to kiss me.

405
00:21:05,426 --> 00:21:07,191
That sounds like Quark.

406
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:10,827
I don't care what anybody says.

407
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:11,998
I love him.

408
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,269
So do I.

409
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:15,404
You really do, don't you?

410
00:21:15,446 --> 00:21:16,414
What?

411
00:21:16,448 --> 00:21:17,416
Love Quark.

412
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,748
Don't bother trying to deny it.

413
00:21:18,787 --> 00:21:20,278
I've seen the way
you look at him.

414
00:21:20,323 --> 00:21:21,450
Please, keep your voice down.

415
00:21:21,492 --> 00:21:22,687
Does he know?

416
00:21:22,727 --> 00:21:24,754
He doesn't even know
I'm a female.

417
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:25,767
You're a woman?

418
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:27,862
Please lower your voice.

419
00:21:27,905 --> 00:21:28,930
Please.

420
00:21:28,974 --> 00:21:31,741
I knew there was something
different about you.

421
00:21:31,779 --> 00:21:34,045
But I've never met
a Ferengi woman before.

422
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,145
You probably never will again.

423
00:21:36,188 --> 00:21:38,624
On my world, women aren't
allowed leave the house

424
00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:40,288
or wear clothes,
or learn to read.

425
00:21:40,329 --> 00:21:41,388
And you wanted more.

426
00:21:41,432 --> 00:21:42,627
Why not?

427
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,898
I'm as smart as any man.

428
00:21:44,939 --> 00:21:47,638
So I made myself a pair
of synthetic lobes

429
00:21:47,711 --> 00:21:48,644
and became one.

430
00:21:48,746 --> 00:21:49,736
Why come here?

431
00:21:49,781 --> 00:21:52,685
To acquire profit, of course.

432
00:21:54,024 --> 00:21:56,494
There's only one thing
I wasn't counting on.

433
00:21:56,528 --> 00:21:58,555
Falling in love with Quark.

434
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:01,092
What do you think I should do?

435
00:22:01,138 --> 00:22:03,108
I don't know.

436
00:22:03,142 --> 00:22:06,046
But I do know there's
more to life than profit.

437
00:22:06,081 --> 00:22:08,278
Pel, it's time!

438
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:10,289
We don't want to keep
the Dosi waiting.

439
00:22:10,323 --> 00:22:11,518
Hurry!

440
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:14,496
Okay, now, I think our best...

441
00:22:30,467 --> 00:22:32,460
Excuse me.

442
00:22:32,504 --> 00:22:34,030
Ah, Major.

443
00:22:34,074 --> 00:22:38,310
Did that shipment of brizeen
nitrate arrive on time?

444
00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:39,408
Yes, it did.

445
00:22:39,451 --> 00:22:40,419
Good.

446
00:22:40,453 --> 00:22:41,648
And here you are to thank me.

447
00:22:41,689 --> 00:22:44,820
Have a seat.

448
00:22:44,862 --> 00:22:47,459
Actually, I just stopped by
to return this.

449
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:49,494
Why, is something
wrong with it?

450
00:22:49,538 --> 00:22:51,508
No, it's lovely,
I just can't accept it.

451
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:52,510
Then I suppose

452
00:22:52,544 --> 00:22:55,744
a night of wild,
passionate romance

453
00:22:55,784 --> 00:22:57,947
is out of the question?

454
00:22:57,989 --> 00:22:59,959
That's right.

455
00:22:59,993 --> 00:23:01,690
Just thought I'd ask.

456
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,636
Dax must be crazy.

457
00:23:08,743 --> 00:23:10,211
Nice view, isn't it?

458
00:23:10,247 --> 00:23:12,717
Don't tell me the negotiations
are already over.

459
00:23:12,751 --> 00:23:13,946
That's fast work, Quark.

460
00:23:13,988 --> 00:23:15,548
Now, let's see the contract.

461
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:18,852
There is no contract.

462
00:23:18,896 --> 00:23:20,422
No contract?

463
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:22,801
But you offered to buy
100,000 vats, didn't you?

464
00:23:22,838 --> 00:23:23,806
Yes.

465
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,808
And?

466
00:23:24,842 --> 00:23:26,368
And that's when they left.

467
00:23:26,412 --> 00:23:27,380
The room?

468
00:23:27,414 --> 00:23:28,404
- The station.
- What?

469
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:30,715
I begged them to stay.

470
00:23:30,754 --> 00:23:33,385
This is a catastrophe,
a complete catastrophe.

471
00:23:33,426 --> 00:23:36,296
This was your big chance, Quark,
and you blew it!

472
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,302
You may have seriously harmed

473
00:23:38,336 --> 00:23:41,775
future Ferengi opportunities
in the Gamma Quadrant!

474
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:42,936
Hold on a minute.

475
00:23:42,979 --> 00:23:44,744
We said we're going
to get you the tulaberries

476
00:23:44,782 --> 00:23:46,445
and that's exactly
what we're going to do.

477
00:23:46,485 --> 00:23:47,453
We are?

478
00:23:47,487 --> 00:23:48,455
How?

479
00:23:48,489 --> 00:23:49,923
We're going to travel

480
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:51,393
to the Gamma Quadrant,
find the Dosi

481
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,829
and get them
to sign the contract.

482
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:55,563
And how do you plan
to get there?

483
00:23:55,603 --> 00:23:57,197
We'll take your ship.

484
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,333
My ship?

485
00:23:58,376 --> 00:24:00,812
Oh, and I suppose
you expect Maihar'du

486
00:24:00,847 --> 00:24:02,145
to pilot it for you.

487
00:24:02,184 --> 00:24:03,584
We don't need Maihar'du.

488
00:24:03,619 --> 00:24:05,213
I can pilot the ship myself.

489
00:24:05,256 --> 00:24:06,554
It's up to you, Nagus.

490
00:24:06,592 --> 00:24:08,789
Do you want
those tulaberries or not?

491
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,331
All right.

492
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:13,566
You can use my ship,
but I'm warning you, Quark...

493
00:24:13,606 --> 00:24:16,601
either you get the Dosi
to sign that contract

494
00:24:16,712 --> 00:24:20,914
or you'll be tending
that worthless little bar

495
00:24:20,954 --> 00:24:22,617
for the rest of your life!

496
00:24:34,748 --> 00:24:37,845
I've waited my whole life
for an opportunity like this.

497
00:24:39,024 --> 00:24:40,653
So have I.

498
00:24:40,693 --> 00:24:43,494
So far, it hasn't turned out
quite the way I planned.

499
00:24:43,533 --> 00:24:45,526
It's not over yet.

500
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,972
I still don't understand
why the Nagus

501
00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:50,411
is suddenly insisting
on 100,000 vats.

502
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,883
Neither do I.

503
00:24:52,918 --> 00:24:54,945
You don't think
he's purposely trying

504
00:24:54,988 --> 00:24:56,514
to sabotage the negotiation?

505
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,050
Why would he?

506
00:24:58,095 --> 00:24:59,928
I have no idea.

507
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:02,231
Hmm. One thing's for certain...

508
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,969
he knows more
than he's letting on.

509
00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:06,136
About what?

510
00:25:06,178 --> 00:25:08,809
Everything...
the tulaberries, the Dosi

511
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,318
even the Gamma Quadrant.

512
00:25:10,353 --> 00:25:11,548
Well, if you ever figure out

513
00:25:11,589 --> 00:25:13,354
what he's up to,
make sure you tell me.

514
00:25:13,392 --> 00:25:16,193
Don't worry, I will.

515
00:25:16,232 --> 00:25:18,259
So far, the only thing
I've done right

516
00:25:18,302 --> 00:25:19,828
is pick you as my consultant.

517
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:23,539
I'm glad you feel that way.

518
00:25:26,218 --> 00:25:28,654
Now, if we can only
make some profit.

519
00:25:30,226 --> 00:25:32,696
Quark, there's something
you should know.

520
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:33,699
Oh, you're too late.

521
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:35,099
I already know
what you're going to say.

522
00:25:35,136 --> 00:25:36,104
You do?

523
00:25:36,138 --> 00:25:37,106
It's no secret.

524
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,199
It's not?

525
00:25:38,242 --> 00:25:40,542
I admit you've been
a great help to me

526
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,279
but you agreed to a 20%
share of the profits

527
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:45,448
and that's all
you're going to get.

528
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,722
I see.

529
00:25:47,827 --> 00:25:50,890
Never place friendship
above profit.

530
00:25:50,934 --> 00:25:53,838
21st Rule of Acquisition.

531
00:25:53,873 --> 00:25:56,002
I'm glad you agree.

532
00:25:56,044 --> 00:25:57,273
Hmm.

533
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:08,100
Go, just go!

534
00:26:08,135 --> 00:26:09,433
Go!

535
00:26:11,976 --> 00:26:13,308
Oh...

536
00:26:14,481 --> 00:26:17,009
Feeling a little
overwhelmed, are we?

537
00:26:17,052 --> 00:26:18,715
I'm glad someone notices.

538
00:26:18,756 --> 00:26:20,282
When's Quark due back?

539
00:26:20,326 --> 00:26:21,852
Oh, how should I know?

540
00:26:21,895 --> 00:26:23,728
He never tells me anything.

541
00:26:23,766 --> 00:26:26,202
He doesn't even bother
to insult me anymore.

542
00:26:26,238 --> 00:26:27,331
Go, go.

543
00:26:27,374 --> 00:26:30,005
It's Pel, that,
that flabby-eared interloper.

544
00:26:30,045 --> 00:26:32,311
He's stealing
my brother's affections.

545
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,750
Hmm, you're better off.

546
00:26:33,853 --> 00:26:35,116
But he's my brother!

547
00:26:35,156 --> 00:26:37,753
Would you let someone
steal your brother?

548
00:26:37,794 --> 00:26:39,262
I don't have a brother.

549
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:40,994
Not that I know of, anyway.

550
00:26:41,034 --> 00:26:43,163
But if you did.

551
00:26:43,205 --> 00:26:46,872
Well, I suppose
if I did have a brother

552
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,713
even one as worthless
as Quark

553
00:26:49,751 --> 00:26:53,316
I wouldn't let anyone
come between us.

554
00:27:34,241 --> 00:27:37,908
There must be something here
I could use against him.

555
00:28:23,037 --> 00:28:24,505
I've got controlling interest

556
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:26,477
so I want to supervise
all operations.

557
00:28:26,511 --> 00:28:27,638
That's ridiculous.

558
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,114
Well, then find another partner.

559
00:28:29,149 --> 00:28:30,640
Let's not be hasty.

560
00:28:30,686 --> 00:28:32,781
I said, no!

561
00:28:34,394 --> 00:28:37,798
Are you enjoying yourselves,
little Ferengi?

562
00:28:37,834 --> 00:28:39,701
How could we not?

563
00:28:39,738 --> 00:28:42,676
Tell us, Z yree...
what is this place?

564
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:46,548
This... this is where
opportunities are made.

565
00:28:46,585 --> 00:28:48,555
Really? I thought it
was some kind of party.

566
00:28:48,589 --> 00:28:49,887
Then you thought wrong.

567
00:28:49,925 --> 00:28:51,359
This is all about profit.

568
00:28:51,395 --> 00:28:52,556
And like the Ferengi

569
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,592
the Dosi are very serious
when it comes to profit.

570
00:28:58,309 --> 00:29:00,472
You, take him away.

571
00:29:00,513 --> 00:29:02,915
Very serious.

572
00:29:08,227 --> 00:29:11,120
Look who finally showed up.

573
00:29:15,228 --> 00:29:16,754
It's about time.

574
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:18,791
Where are you going?

575
00:29:18,835 --> 00:29:20,737
To get serious about profit.

576
00:29:20,773 --> 00:29:21,763
Hey, watch it!

577
00:29:26,116 --> 00:29:29,179
Oh... it's you, Ferengi.

578
00:29:29,223 --> 00:29:31,922
Aren't you on the wrong
side of the wormhole?

579
00:29:31,962 --> 00:29:33,556
It certainly feels that way.

580
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:36,035
Fortunately, all I need
is your thumbscan

581
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:39,531
on this very lucrative contract
and I can go home.

582
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:41,547
You had your chance.

583
00:29:44,587 --> 00:29:45,555
Go away!

584
00:29:45,589 --> 00:29:47,320
Not until we finish
our discussion.

585
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:54,002
You... are starting
to annoy me.

586
00:30:07,566 --> 00:30:09,229
Sorry.

587
00:30:10,204 --> 00:30:12,869
I should have killed you
back on that station.

588
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:15,244
But you didn't because
deep down inside

589
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:17,581
you recognize a good opportunity
when you see one.

590
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,558
Just put your thumbscan here.

591
00:30:22,228 --> 00:30:25,689
All right, you can
have the 10,000 vats.

592
00:30:25,736 --> 00:30:26,704
100,000.

593
00:30:26,738 --> 00:30:28,264
I told you before
that's impossible!

594
00:30:28,307 --> 00:30:30,334
100,000 and I'm not leaving
till I get it.

595
00:30:30,379 --> 00:30:31,813
Fine.

596
00:30:31,848 --> 00:30:33,146
Then stay.

597
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,740
Wouldn't we be more comfortable
sleeping on the ship?

598
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,747
No, I want to be right here
in case Inglatu

599
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:49,839
changes his mind.

600
00:30:49,884 --> 00:30:51,547
Don't worry, I don't snore.

601
00:30:51,588 --> 00:30:53,148
Wait!

602
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,215
What is it?

603
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:55,625
The mattress.

604
00:30:55,662 --> 00:30:56,595
What about it?

605
00:30:56,631 --> 00:30:58,328
It looks lumpy.

606
00:30:58,368 --> 00:31:00,429
Actually, it's very comfortable.

607
00:31:00,472 --> 00:31:02,374
I can't sleep
on a lumpy mattress.

608
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:05,007
Well, you're in luck, there's
not a lump to be found.

609
00:31:05,047 --> 00:31:06,015
Try it for yourself.

610
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:07,142
What side do you want?

611
00:31:07,185 --> 00:31:08,814
What are you doing?

612
00:31:08,855 --> 00:31:10,620
Getting undressed.
What does it look like?

613
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:12,356
You're not going to sleep,
are you?

614
00:31:12,396 --> 00:31:14,389
Why not? I'm tired.

615
00:31:14,434 --> 00:31:17,565
Shouldn't we be discussing
rules of strategy?

616
00:31:17,606 --> 00:31:19,074
There's nothing to discuss.

617
00:31:19,109 --> 00:31:20,236
But you know

618
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,407
what the 103rd Rule
of Acquisition says.

619
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,748
Not offhand.

620
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:25,345
Sleep can interfere...

621
00:31:25,389 --> 00:31:27,484
And I don't care, either!

622
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,722
Wait!

623
00:31:29,764 --> 00:31:31,062
What is it now?

624
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:32,728
First a toast.

625
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:33,567
To what?

626
00:31:33,605 --> 00:31:35,700
To, uh, profit, of course.

627
00:31:35,742 --> 00:31:37,678
Of course.

628
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,190
Is it warm in here?

629
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,756
It must be the wine.

630
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,166
I hope so.

631
00:31:49,202 --> 00:31:50,796
I was really impressed

632
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:53,309
with the way
you handled Inglatu.

633
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,337
I was good, wasn't I?

634
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:56,975
Now let's get to bed.

635
00:31:57,018 --> 00:31:58,316
Wait!

636
00:31:58,354 --> 00:31:59,822
The look on his face

637
00:31:59,891 --> 00:32:02,454
when you knocked
over that barrel.

638
00:32:02,496 --> 00:32:04,090
That was risky.

639
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:07,036
The riskier the road,
the greater the profit.

640
00:32:07,071 --> 00:32:08,334
62nd Rule.

641
00:32:08,374 --> 00:32:09,467
That's right.

642
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,243
You really know your Rules.

643
00:32:12,282 --> 00:32:15,777
And you have a very nice smile.

644
00:32:15,889 --> 00:32:17,152
I do?

645
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:22,390
Oh, Quark, I have something
I have to tell you.

646
00:32:23,404 --> 00:32:25,135
I'm not interrupting anything,
am I?

647
00:32:25,174 --> 00:32:27,201
No, definitely not!

648
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:28,508
Are you sure?

649
00:32:28,548 --> 00:32:29,811
Positive!

650
00:32:29,884 --> 00:32:31,478
I'll come back tomorrow.

651
00:32:31,521 --> 00:32:33,491
Wait!

652
00:32:33,525 --> 00:32:34,618
No, wait!

653
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,026
This is all a silly
misunderstanding.

654
00:32:36,063 --> 00:32:37,326
But you seem to be... busy.

655
00:32:37,365 --> 00:32:38,663
Busy?

656
00:32:38,702 --> 00:32:40,638
Don't be ridiculous.

657
00:32:40,672 --> 00:32:42,972
We can't wait to hear
what you have to say.

658
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:46,244
Besides, we could use
the company.

659
00:32:46,283 --> 00:32:47,308
Uh, isn't that right?

660
00:32:47,352 --> 00:32:48,411
Absolutely.

661
00:32:48,454 --> 00:32:49,683
All right, then.

662
00:32:49,724 --> 00:32:51,489
Let me give you some advice...

663
00:32:51,527 --> 00:32:53,861
Inglatu will never
sell you 100,000 vats

664
00:32:53,932 --> 00:32:56,870
of tulaberry wine, not
because he doesn't want to

665
00:32:56,904 --> 00:32:58,167
but because he can't.

666
00:32:58,207 --> 00:33:00,040
If he can't, who can? You?

667
00:33:00,077 --> 00:33:01,671
I wish I could, but there aren't

668
00:33:01,714 --> 00:33:03,581
that many vats
on the entire planet.

669
00:33:03,618 --> 00:33:04,745
Then we're finished.

670
00:33:04,787 --> 00:33:06,552
Not necessarily.

671
00:33:06,591 --> 00:33:08,117
If you really want

672
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,062
100,000 vats of tulaberry wine

673
00:33:10,097 --> 00:33:13,069
I can put you in touch
with the right people.

674
00:33:13,103 --> 00:33:15,300
For a price, of course.

675
00:33:15,341 --> 00:33:17,038
Of course.

676
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:20,779
I always said you were
my favorite Dosi.

677
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:23,848
Now, um, who do we have to see?

678
00:33:23,892 --> 00:33:26,489
The Karemma.

679
00:33:26,531 --> 00:33:28,626
Who's the Karemma?

680
00:33:28,668 --> 00:33:30,695
An important power
in the Dominion.

681
00:33:30,739 --> 00:33:32,265
The Dominion, what's that?

682
00:33:32,308 --> 00:33:34,676
Let's just say,
if you want to do business

683
00:33:34,714 --> 00:33:35,875
in the Gamma Quadrant

684
00:33:35,982 --> 00:33:38,715
you have to do business
with the Dominion.

685
00:33:51,413 --> 00:33:54,783
"The most profitable opportunity
in Ferengi history"...

686
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,414
that's what Zek called it

687
00:33:56,456 --> 00:33:58,426
but he didn't mean tulaberries,
no.

688
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,191
He meant the Dominion.

689
00:34:00,231 --> 00:34:02,360
That's why he sabotaged
negotiations.

690
00:34:02,401 --> 00:34:04,098
He never wanted to do
business with the Dosi

691
00:34:04,139 --> 00:34:05,129
he just wanted to use them

692
00:34:05,174 --> 00:34:06,472
to get
to a more important member

693
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,478
of the Dominion!

694
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:08,878
Quark, we need to talk.

695
00:34:08,948 --> 00:34:09,881
We are talking.

696
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:12,615
Don't you want to know
why I kissed you?

697
00:34:12,656 --> 00:34:14,558
You never kissed me.

698
00:34:14,593 --> 00:34:15,993
Yes, I did.

699
00:34:16,029 --> 00:34:16,997
No, you didn't

700
00:34:17,031 --> 00:34:18,694
and I don't want
to discuss it anymore.

701
00:34:18,735 --> 00:34:20,398
Let's just concentrate
on the Dominion.

702
00:34:20,437 --> 00:34:22,498
I only wish Z yree
would have told us more.

703
00:34:22,542 --> 00:34:25,844
Maybe it's
some planetary alliance

704
00:34:25,882 --> 00:34:28,114
or trading consortium.

705
00:34:28,153 --> 00:34:31,421
Whatever it is, it's important

706
00:34:31,459 --> 00:34:34,192
and I want a piece of it.

707
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,766
Quark, I'm very disappointed.

708
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,575
I really wanted
those tulaberries.

709
00:34:41,614 --> 00:34:42,741
You and I both know my trip

710
00:34:42,783 --> 00:34:44,343
had nothing to do
with tulaberries.

711
00:34:44,385 --> 00:34:45,353
It didn't?

712
00:34:45,387 --> 00:34:46,616
I must speak with you, Brother.

713
00:34:46,657 --> 00:34:47,920
Can't you see I'm busy?

714
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,264
Does the word "Dominion"
mean anything to you?

715
00:34:52,301 --> 00:34:53,530
What have you found out?

716
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:54,538
You first.

717
00:34:54,572 --> 00:34:55,540
Please, Brother, it's urgent.

718
00:34:55,574 --> 00:34:56,542
Not now!

719
00:34:56,576 --> 00:34:57,544
I'm waiting.

720
00:34:57,578 --> 00:35:00,106
Well, most of my information
consists

721
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:02,781
of little more
than hints and whispers

722
00:35:02,823 --> 00:35:04,486
but it's enough to convince me

723
00:35:04,525 --> 00:35:07,520
that whoever learns
the secret of the Dominion

724
00:35:07,565 --> 00:35:10,035
whatever that may be,
will learn the secret

725
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,504
of the Gamma Quadrant.

726
00:35:11,539 --> 00:35:14,909
Unfortunately, the Dosi
don't seem to know very much.

727
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:18,078
I was hoping they'd lead
us to someone who does.

728
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,488
What would such information
be worth to you?

729
00:35:20,524 --> 00:35:21,617
A lot.

730
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:25,100
What if I told you
I could arrange a meeting

731
00:35:25,134 --> 00:35:28,504
between you and a powerful
member of the Dominion?

732
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,703
If you can do that,
I'll see to it

733
00:35:30,745 --> 00:35:34,378
that you earn a percentage
of every Ferengi opportunity

734
00:35:34,419 --> 00:35:36,855
in the Gamma Quadrant.

735
00:35:36,891 --> 00:35:38,952
Ah...

736
00:35:38,995 --> 00:35:41,933
that's a lot of latinum.

737
00:35:41,968 --> 00:35:44,963
Give me... a name.

738
00:35:45,007 --> 00:35:50,143
- The Karemma.
- The Karemma.

739
00:35:50,184 --> 00:35:54,990
I always knew you had
the lobes for business.

740
00:35:56,697 --> 00:35:59,167
Now may I speak with you,
Brother?

741
00:35:59,202 --> 00:36:01,365
All right, but make it quick.

742
00:36:37,433 --> 00:36:38,731
Easy, now.

743
00:36:38,837 --> 00:36:40,466
That's quite a bump
you've got there.

744
00:36:40,506 --> 00:36:41,496
Where's Rom?

745
00:36:41,541 --> 00:36:42,702
Right here, Brother.

746
00:36:42,745 --> 00:36:44,271
Luckily, there
doesn't seem to be

747
00:36:44,314 --> 00:36:45,304
any serious damage.

748
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:46,749
Uh, if you don't mind

749
00:36:46,853 --> 00:36:49,654
I'd like to rest here
for a few minutes.

750
00:36:49,691 --> 00:36:51,217
Of course.

751
00:36:51,261 --> 00:36:52,890
I'll be in the other room
if you need me.

752
00:36:52,932 --> 00:36:54,332
Thank you, Doctor.

753
00:36:56,638 --> 00:36:59,074
You haven't told anybody,
have you?

754
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,670
You mean about Pel?

755
00:37:00,713 --> 00:37:01,681
Quiet.

756
00:37:01,715 --> 00:37:03,412
I haven't breathed a word.

757
00:37:03,452 --> 00:37:05,547
I thought it'd be best
if you told Zek yourself.

758
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:07,286
Nobody's going to tell Zek
anything, is that clear?

759
00:37:07,327 --> 00:37:09,092
But she's a female...

760
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,621
Not so loud.

761
00:37:10,666 --> 00:37:13,297
Who wears clothes and is
trying to earn profit.

762
00:37:13,339 --> 00:37:14,602
Why, she even quotes

763
00:37:14,641 --> 00:37:16,975
from the sacred Rules
of Acquisition.

764
00:37:17,013 --> 00:37:19,541
Such a female must be
severely punished.

765
00:37:19,584 --> 00:37:20,552
I know that.

766
00:37:20,586 --> 00:37:22,020
Then we'll stop her.

767
00:37:22,056 --> 00:37:23,422
No.

768
00:37:23,459 --> 00:37:26,192
You're scaring me, Brother.

769
00:37:28,135 --> 00:37:30,401
Could it be you have
feelings for this woman?

770
00:37:30,439 --> 00:37:31,907
Of course not.

771
00:37:31,943 --> 00:37:33,503
Don't you see?

772
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:37,178
If Zek learns that I've
been deceived by a female

773
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,279
I'd be ruined.

774
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:39,790
He'd never trust me again.

775
00:37:39,892 --> 00:37:42,089
But if you don't tell
him and he finds out

776
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,598
you're certain to be ruined.

777
00:37:43,632 --> 00:37:46,331
You have to tell him, or I will.

778
00:37:46,371 --> 00:37:48,273
Let me go.

779
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:50,107
I have to save you
from yourself.

780
00:37:50,146 --> 00:37:51,512
Forget about me.
What about the bar?

781
00:37:51,548 --> 00:37:53,074
The bar?

782
00:37:53,118 --> 00:37:54,484
You still want it, don't you?

783
00:37:54,521 --> 00:37:56,286
Don't you?

784
00:37:56,324 --> 00:37:57,292
Who needs the bar

785
00:37:57,326 --> 00:37:58,794
when I can have
the Gamma Quadrant?

786
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:01,393
I'll transfer
ownership immediately

787
00:38:01,435 --> 00:38:02,767
but only on one condition...

788
00:38:02,871 --> 00:38:07,575
that you never mention the truth
about Pel to anyone.

789
00:38:07,613 --> 00:38:09,104
Pel?

790
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,313
W-W-What about him?

791
00:38:13,827 --> 00:38:15,353
Yeah.

792
00:38:16,698 --> 00:38:17,961
Come.

793
00:38:23,045 --> 00:38:24,810
Where are your lobes?

794
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:27,514
Over there.

795
00:38:27,553 --> 00:38:29,750
Well, put them on
before somebody sees you.

796
00:38:30,894 --> 00:38:33,296
No one's going to see me.

797
00:38:33,332 --> 00:38:35,825
Put them on.

798
00:38:35,904 --> 00:38:37,338
Now.

799
00:38:37,373 --> 00:38:39,400
And wrap yourself up.

800
00:38:44,754 --> 00:38:46,417
Have you finished packing?

801
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:47,721
Am I going somewhere?

802
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,459
As far away from this station
as possible.

803
00:38:50,499 --> 00:38:51,967
But you need me, Quark.

804
00:38:52,003 --> 00:38:54,030
I'm the only one you can trust.

805
00:38:54,073 --> 00:38:55,906
Not anymore.

806
00:38:58,148 --> 00:39:00,949
Well, what did you expect?

807
00:39:00,987 --> 00:39:03,116
I mean, look at you.

808
00:39:03,158 --> 00:39:05,686
You're wearing clothes.

809
00:39:05,729 --> 00:39:06,719
Is that a crime?

810
00:39:06,765 --> 00:39:08,462
As a matter of fact, it is.

811
00:39:08,502 --> 00:39:11,838
Look, it's just too risky
for you to stay here.

812
00:39:11,876 --> 00:39:14,073
And you can take this with you.

813
00:39:14,113 --> 00:39:15,172
What is it?

814
00:39:15,216 --> 00:39:16,616
Ten bars of latinum.

815
00:39:16,651 --> 00:39:18,712
To help you start a new life.

816
00:39:21,394 --> 00:39:23,159
If you're going
to pretend you're a man

817
00:39:23,198 --> 00:39:24,223
act like one.

818
00:39:24,267 --> 00:39:25,599
Take the profit.

819
00:39:25,636 --> 00:39:27,663
This is not about profit anymore

820
00:39:27,707 --> 00:39:28,732
it's about love!

821
00:39:28,775 --> 00:39:31,770
Oh, spoken like a true female.

822
00:39:31,815 --> 00:39:33,876
I love you, Quark

823
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,685
and I know you care
about me, too.

824
00:39:35,723 --> 00:39:36,691
Admit it!

825
00:39:36,725 --> 00:39:38,718
What difference
does it make if I do?

826
00:39:38,762 --> 00:39:40,857
You'd never be happy
being a Ferengi wife.

827
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,667
Then come with me
to the Gamma Quadrant.

828
00:39:43,705 --> 00:39:46,005
No one there cares if
I wear clothes or not.

829
00:39:47,948 --> 00:39:49,884
I'd care.

830
00:39:54,127 --> 00:39:56,963
Then I guess
I'd better start packing.

831
00:40:01,174 --> 00:40:03,041
I guess so.

832
00:40:06,384 --> 00:40:09,949
Mmm... mmm... mmm.

833
00:40:11,194 --> 00:40:13,187
Mmm... mmm...

834
00:40:13,231 --> 00:40:14,860
Mmm!

835
00:40:19,077 --> 00:40:20,409
Mmm.

836
00:40:20,446 --> 00:40:24,819
These flaked blood fleas
are surprisingly succulent.

837
00:40:24,854 --> 00:40:27,655
Mm-hmm, you really should
try them, Brother... mmm...

838
00:40:27,693 --> 00:40:30,186
I'm not feeling
particularly hungry.

839
00:40:30,232 --> 00:40:31,495
Let me guess.

840
00:40:31,534 --> 00:40:33,766
Too busy thinking
about how to spend

841
00:40:33,805 --> 00:40:36,105
all that latinum
we're going to earn?

842
00:40:36,144 --> 00:40:37,670
Well, I don't blame you.

843
00:40:38,682 --> 00:40:39,672
Come.

844
00:40:45,763 --> 00:40:48,256
I thought you said
she left the station!

845
00:40:48,301 --> 00:40:49,735
I thought she did.

846
00:40:49,771 --> 00:40:51,239
I hope you don't mind, Quark

847
00:40:51,274 --> 00:40:54,337
but I couldn't leave without
saying good-bye to the Nagus.

848
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,848
I'm glad you stopped by.

849
00:40:55,883 --> 00:40:57,853
I know how much
you helped Quark

850
00:40:57,887 --> 00:40:59,378
during the negotiations.

851
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:01,917
I predict a big future
for you, Pel.

852
00:41:01,962 --> 00:41:04,593
You certainly have
the lobes for it.

853
00:41:06,371 --> 00:41:08,466
So, you like my lobes?

854
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:09,840
Pel...

855
00:41:09,877 --> 00:41:11,574
Yes, I do.

856
00:41:11,614 --> 00:41:13,481
Good, then you can have them!

857
00:41:13,518 --> 00:41:14,577
No!

858
00:41:15,789 --> 00:41:16,950
It's a female!

859
00:41:16,992 --> 00:41:18,483
Does this mean
I don't get the bar?

860
00:41:18,528 --> 00:41:20,019
Rom... out.

861
00:41:20,132 --> 00:41:22,125
Quark, this is outrageous!

862
00:41:22,169 --> 00:41:23,535
Now what's going on here?

863
00:41:23,572 --> 00:41:24,540
I-I-I...

864
00:41:24,574 --> 00:41:25,564
Leave him out of this!

865
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:27,704
You dare give me orders?

866
00:41:27,746 --> 00:41:29,306
You knew about this all along,
didn't you?

867
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,443
I...

868
00:41:30,486 --> 00:41:33,049
So tell me more
about my big future.

869
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:34,650
You have no future.

870
00:41:34,694 --> 00:41:38,828
I'll see to it that you spend
the rest of your life in prison.

871
00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:40,235
No.

872
00:41:40,272 --> 00:41:41,866
Let me remind you

873
00:41:41,908 --> 00:41:44,505
that taking business advice
from a female

874
00:41:44,547 --> 00:41:46,517
is a violation of Ferengi law.

875
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:48,714
I didn't know she was a female.

876
00:41:48,755 --> 00:41:50,554
Stupidity is no excuse.

877
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,186
Now, one more word out of you

878
00:41:52,229 --> 00:41:54,222
and you are going
to share her cell.

879
00:41:54,267 --> 00:41:56,464
Then, you better make sure
it's big enough for three.

880
00:41:56,504 --> 00:41:57,802
Are you threatening me?

881
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,901
I wonder
what your associates will say

882
00:41:59,944 --> 00:42:02,973
when I tell them you allowed
a female to represent you

883
00:42:03,017 --> 00:42:04,280
in a business negotiation.

884
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,811
I didn't know
she was a female.

885
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,122
Stupidity is no excuse.

886
00:42:10,299 --> 00:42:12,394
I see your point.

887
00:42:12,436 --> 00:42:14,463
It seems that Pel's identity

888
00:42:14,507 --> 00:42:17,070
will have to remain
our little secret

889
00:42:17,179 --> 00:42:18,781
but it's going to cost you.

890
00:42:18,913 --> 00:42:22,079
My Gamma Quadrant profits.

891
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,719
I've always said you were
a bright fellow, Quark.

892
00:42:31,372 --> 00:42:33,604
Shame on you!

893
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,517
I hope you're satisfied.

894
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:54,448
I'm sorry...

895
00:42:54,485 --> 00:42:55,544
but it's time you learned

896
00:42:55,587 --> 00:42:57,454
that when it comes
to accumulating profit

897
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:59,518
women are as capable as men.

898
00:42:59,561 --> 00:43:04,025
Well, do me a favor
and don't tell anybody else.

899
00:43:07,244 --> 00:43:10,375
I should go.

900
00:43:10,417 --> 00:43:14,187
I've booked passage
on an Andorian transport.

901
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:17,025
You could come with me.

902
00:43:18,566 --> 00:43:20,331
I can't.

903
00:43:21,772 --> 00:43:23,298
I know.

904
00:43:32,294 --> 00:43:35,596
Well, then, I guess
if I can't have you

905
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:39,731
I'll take those ten bars
of latinum after all.

906
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,601
So, Lieutenant...

907
00:43:56,642 --> 00:43:59,170
you ready for another
night of <i>tongo?</i>

908
00:43:59,214 --> 00:44:01,548
Haven't you lost enough
for one day?

909
00:44:01,585 --> 00:44:03,384
I don't know
what you're talking about.

910
00:44:03,423 --> 00:44:05,552
I'm talking about Pel.

911
00:44:05,593 --> 00:44:08,588
She came by to see me
before she left.

912
00:44:08,633 --> 00:44:10,159
I'm going to miss her.

913
00:44:10,203 --> 00:44:11,729
So are you.

914
00:44:11,772 --> 00:44:15,040
You really think I'd let anyone
come between us?

915
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:17,208
Nice try, Quark

916
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:19,152
but I know you better than that.
