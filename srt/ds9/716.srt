1
00:00:01,543 --> 00:00:03,462
KIRA:
All right, next item.

2
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:07,424
Item seven, warbird repair
and maintenance. Senator?

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,927
Repairs on our ships
have continually been delayed

4
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:12,638
in favor of Klingon
and Federation vessels.

5
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:16,183
The<i> Dividices</i> and the<i> Genorex</i> 
have been waiting
almost three weeks

6
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,143
while more than
a dozen Klingon ships

7
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,228
have been given
first priority.

8
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,982
Well, I make up
the repair schedule
according to<i> my</i> assessment

9
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:25,400
of which ships have
the greatest need.

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,779
Odd that the Klingons
seem to always have
the greatest need.

11
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,364
They are usually
more damaged

12
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,282
because Klingon warships
are relentless

13
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,993
in pressing home
their attack.

14
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:35,911
"Reckless" would be
another way of putting it.

15
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:38,664
The fight must be
taken to the enemy.
We cannot win this war...

16
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,458
All right, we're not here
to debate combat tactics.

17
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:45,086
Chief, how soon
can you have those warbirds
into a docking bay?

18
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,255
Well, I suppose I could
bring them in tomorrow.

19
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:50,801
But that would mean delaying
repairs to the<i> Hornet</i> 
and the<i> Rotarran.</i>

20
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,761
Somebody's going
to have to explain

21
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,347
to General Martok
why his flagship was bumped.

22
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:59,393
Worf, you just volunteered
for that assignment.

23
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,730
This brings up the
question of shore leave.

24
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,982
At the moment,
we have the crews

25
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:07,401
from two Klingon ships
on the station.

26
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:11,030
I'd rather not have that
many Klingons and Romulans

27
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,156
on the Promenade
at the same time.

28
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,659
We'll forgo shore leave
until the Klingons depart.

29
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,912
Our soldiers
are professionals.

30
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:19,788
They're here to fight

31
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,290
not to get drunk
in Quark's.

32
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,043
KIRA: All right.
That's it for today then.

33
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:25,210
Same time next week?

34
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,461
Oh, sorry, Senator.

35
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,880
You'll be attending
that conference

36
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,548
on Romulus,
won't you?

37
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:32,300
Yes, but Subcommander Velal
will be here in my place.

38
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,928
Fine. Have
a safe trip.

39
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:35,094
Thank you.

40
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,183
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
Ah, yes.

41
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,476
Romulus...

42
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,062
how well I remember it.

43
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:46,690
You'll find the predominant
color to be gray--

44
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,068
the buildings, the
clothes, the people.

45
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:51,862
Did you know that the Romulan
heart itself is gray?

46
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,572
It's true.

47
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:56,241
And altogether appropriate
for such an unimaginative race.

48
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,785
I take it
you didn't enjoy

49
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,578
your brief stint
on Romulus.

50
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,372
You were... posing
as a gardener, weren't you?

51
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,749
It was one of
the few instances

52
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:06,167
where my cover
was more enjoyable

53
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,252
than the actual assignment.

54
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,796
What was the
assignment anyway?

55
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,339
I'm afraid
I can't talk about that.

56
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,216
Back to the subject
at hand.

57
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:16,511
What would your role be
at this conference?

58
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:19,098
Well, I'll be giving a talk
on Dominion biogenic weapons

59
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:21,767
chairing a seminar
on ketracel-white

60
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:24,019
and attending a meeting
on a proposal

61
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:27,606
to transfer 25
Federation hospital ships

62
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:29,232
over to
Romulan control.

63
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,317
How dull.

64
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,359
Sorry to
disappoint.

65
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,903
Admiral Ross and his staff

66
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,905
will be discussing the
"exciting" military issues.

67
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,865
I see.

68
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,784
I-I trust that
Starfleet Intelligence

69
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,285
will be sending
someone along

70
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,997
to make good use
of this opportunity.

71
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,164
What do you mean?

72
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,165
Well, isn't it obvious?

73
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,917
This is a golden
opportunity

74
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,878
to gather intelligence
on Romulan intentions

75
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,254
and military capabilities.

76
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,631
They're our allies, Garak.

77
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,341
And with any luck

78
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,510
this could be the beginning
of an entirely new friendship

79
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,678
between our peoples.

80
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,638
The eternal optimist.

81
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,015
Guilty as charged.

82
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:02,432
How sad.

83
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,267
I must tell you,
I'm disappointed

84
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,228
at hearing you mouth
the usual platitudes

85
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,689
of peace and friendship

86
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:13,068
regarding an implacable foe
like the Romulans.

87
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:16,989
But I live in hope
that one day

88
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,449
you'll come to see
this universe

89
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,118
for what it truly is

90
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:24,038
rather than what
you'd wish it to be.

91
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:26,373
Well, I shall endeavor
to become more cynical

92
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,000
with each passing day.

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,003
Look gift horses
squarely in the mouth

94
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:34,965
and find clouds in
every silver lining.

95
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,384
If only you meant it.

96
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,481
Lights.

97
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,694
Sloan.

98
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:56,945
Hello, Doctor.

99
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,780
It's good to see you.

100
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,615
I hope you're
well rested.

101
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,493
Section 31 has
an assignment for you.

102
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:04,698
You're taking quite a risk.

103
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,533
I could have a security team
here in 30 seconds.

104
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,617
I suspect

105
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,077
you'd be unable to communicate

106
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,745
with anyone
outside of this room.

107
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,206
I could scream for help.

108
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,666
Possible
but uncharacteristic.

109
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,084
I mean, screaming for help--

110
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,586
that's... that's
too undignified for you.

111
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,505
But don't let me stop you.

112
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,882
I enjoy being wrong.

113
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:22,841
What do you want?

114
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:23,717
I told you.

115
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:24,885
You have an assignment.

116
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,594
I don't work for you.

117
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,971
You passed the test.

118
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,890
You were accepted
into the organization.

119
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,391
I didn't ask to be accepted.

120
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,601
You were, nevertheless.

121
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,814
And now it's time to go to work.

122
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,191
I'm sure you're
dying to know

123
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:40,441
what your mission is

124
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,277
but you won't give me
the satisfaction

125
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,237
of admitting it.

126
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:46,073
So I'll just tell you.

127
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,282
Lucky me.

128
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:50,952
Section 31
is extremely interested

129
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,038
in this conference of yours.

130
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,998
However, the Tal Shiar

131
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,125
will be handling
the security arrangements

132
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,002
so we'll have
virtually no chance

133
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:02,421
of using any technical assets
to gather intelligence.

134
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:06,218
As a result, we'll be forced
to rely on organic assets...

135
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,594
like you.

136
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,931
Your mission
is to gather data

137
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,515
about the Romulan
leadership.

138
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,101
In essence, we want you

139
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,519
to take the pulse
of their government.

140
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,521
No pun intended.

141
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,691
You want me to spy
on an ally?

142
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,611
To "evaluate" an ally.

143
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,406
And a temporary ally at that.

144
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:30,867
Now, I say that, because
when the war is over

145
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,328
the following will happen
in short order--

146
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,497
the Dominion will be forced
back to the Gamma Quadrant.

147
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,417
The Cardassian Empire

148
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,085
will be occupied.

149
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,796
The Klingon Empire
will spend the next
ten years recovering

150
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,007
from the war and won't pose
a serious threat to anyone.

151
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:50,470
That leaves two powers to vie
for control of the Quadrant--

152
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,099
the Federation and the Romulans.

153
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,143
This war isn't over

154
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,479
and you're already
planning for the next.

155
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,939
Well put.

156
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,775
I hope your report
is equally succinct.

157
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,027
How many times do I have
to tell you, Sloan?

158
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,280
I don't work for you.

159
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,031
You will.

160
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,575
It's in your nature.

161
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,829
You are a man
who loves secrets--

162
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,791
medical, personal, fictional.

163
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,170
And I am a man of secrets.

164
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,672
You want to know what I know

165
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,841
and the only way
to do that

166
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,884
is to accept the assignment.

167
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,112
Whoa! Easy, Julian.

168
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,864
What's going on?

169
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,120
Odo's checked
all the security logs.

170
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,538
There's no indication

171
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,581
of how Sloan got aboard
or where he went.

172
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,916
I can't say I'm surprised.

173
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,626
From what we've seen of them

174
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,629
Section 31 is very meticulous
in covering its tracks.

175
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,050
I had a conversation with
Admiral Ross this afternoon.

176
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,635
He and I both agree
that the Romulan conference

177
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,429
is too important to cancel.

178
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,056
What about me?

179
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,598
Starfleet Command
has promised

180
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,893
to send<i> the</i> expert
on Dominion biogenic weapons

181
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,687
and ketracel-white
to the conference.

182
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,898
Since that's you, you go.

183
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,900
And we want you to carry out
your assignment.

184
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,861
Make a few discreet observations
on the Romulan leadership

185
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,447
and then wait for Sloan
to contact you again.

186
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,865
Somehow, I don't
think giving Sloan

187
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,034
any information
is a good idea.

188
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:39,620
That was my instinct as well,
but after talking to Ross

189
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,457
I think we might have
an opportunity here

190
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,459
we can turn to our advantage.

191
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,169
Officially, Starfleet Command

192
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,838
has said that they are appalled
at the very notion

193
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:52,008
that an organization like
Section 31 might exist

194
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,385
and that they plan

195
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:56,221
to get to the bottom
of this entire business.

196
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,722
And unofficially?

197
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:01,142
They have quietly
pushed the investigation aside.

198
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:04,812
Which means either they
don't take Section 31 seriously

199
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:08,316
or... someone at Starfleet
Command is protecting them.

200
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:12,571
Either way, we now have a chance
to get someone inside

201
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:15,240
and I think I want to take it.

202
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,908
So you want me to play along?

203
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:20,287
Pretend that I've decided
to work for Sloan after all?

204
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,413
Exactly.

205
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,415
When he contacts you
to find out

206
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:24,999
what you learned
at the conference

207
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,294
make it seem like
you've reluctantly come around

208
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,711
to his way of thinking.

209
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,339
Let him believe
that he has seduced you

210
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,591
into helping him.

211
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:33,925
Well, that shouldn't
be too difficult.

212
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:35,676
Sloan thinks I'm
already so tempted

213
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,512
that I barely can see straight.

214
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:40,181
Well, listen, I better pack.

215
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,350
The<i> Bellerophon</i> leaves
in three hours.

216
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,936
One more thing, Doctor.

217
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,021
Remember this isn't a game.

218
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,690
Section 31 is<i> very</i> dangerous.

219
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,277
If Sloan even suspects
that you are really

220
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,320
working for us...

221
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,404
I understand.

222
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:00,701
Good hunting.

223
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,549
A glass of
Romulan ale, Doctor?

224
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:15,925
Thank you, Senator.

225
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,427
The trading embargo
has been officially lifted

226
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,677
if you were wondering.

227
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,555
It hadn't crossed
my mind, actually.

228
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:23,266
To one of the many benefits
of the alliance.

229
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:28,062
(<i> coughing</i> )

230
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,356
Need a medical
team, sir?

231
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,982
No, thank you.

232
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:33,568
Don't tell me this is
your first glass of Romulan ale.

233
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:34,819
Well, it was...

234
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:35,820
(<i> coughing</i> )

235
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,738
ille... illegal.

236
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,073
That never stopped
most of your colleagues.

237
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,201
ROSS:
I know--
I was probably

238
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,577
one of the few officers
in the fleet

239
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,204
who didn't indulge
occasionally.

240
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,330
(<i> coughs</i> )

241
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,456
Would you like
something else?

242
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,748
No, no, I'll manage.

243
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,376
That's the spirit, sir.
Never say die.

244
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,212
What an odd expression.

245
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,588
What does it mean?

246
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:56,383
It's a line
from an old
Earth poem.

247
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:59,093
Forgive me for
interrupting.

248
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,345
I couldn't help overhearing

249
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,889
and etymology is
one of my hobbies.

250
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:07,143
The, uh, phrase "never
say die" is originally

251
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,937
from a 19th
century poem

252
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,856
based on Shakespeare's
<i>Merchant of Venice.</i>

253
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:15,360
Now, it's since passed
into the vernacular

254
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,196
as a, as an exhortation
never to give up

255
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,780
no matter the cost.

256
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,948
Interesting.

257
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,284
Wendell Greer,
Assistant Director

258
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,912
UFP Department
of Cartography.

259
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,121
It's a pleasure.

260
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,998
Admiral William Ross,
Senator Cretak.

261
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,000
Admiral... Senator.

262
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,335
And Dr. Julian Bashir.

263
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:36,047
Ah, the physician
from Deep Space Nine.

264
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,632
I was hoping
to meet you.

265
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:38,757
I have so
many questions

266
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,010
about the Bajoran sector--

267
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,681
navigational anomalies,
the transport patterns...

268
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,057
Could you spare a moment?

269
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,766
Unless I'm interrupting.

270
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:48,809
Not at all.

271
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,232
Try to play your cards

272
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,067
a little closer
to your vest, Doctor.

273
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,736
You're lucky
they didn't see

274
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:59,487
that look of shock
on your face.

275
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,156
You managed to get yourself
attached to this delegation.

276
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,241
Why do you need me?

277
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,825
All in due time.

278
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,453
Now you have a lot
of work to do

279
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:07,870
before we arrive
at Romulus.

280
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,373
There's a padd in your
quarters-- read it.

281
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,125
I'll join you at 2200.

282
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,797
Well, Mr. Greer
certainly has
his ducks in a row.

283
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:21,134
According to
the Department
of Cartography

284
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,553
he's been a low-level
bureaucrat for
almost 15 years.

285
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:24,763
Well, it doesn't
surprise me

286
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:26,306
he has a solid
cover story, sir.

287
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,557
But I think it's
too dangerous

288
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:28,933
to allow him
to participate

289
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,685
in the conference
or even set foot on Romulus.

290
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,228
We don't know
what he's up to.

291
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,063
On the other hand, if
we move against him now

292
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,108
we lose any hope of
penetrating Section 31.

293
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,944
His access at this
conference will be limited

294
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,988
to a few low-level
briefings and seminars.

295
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,906
It shouldn't be too hard
keeping tabs on him.

296
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,534
If Sloan's here...

297
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,869
it suggests something
more important

298
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,247
than a simple
intelligence-gathering mission.

299
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,374
He's up to something

300
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,169
and it's imperative that we
know what that something is.

301
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,713
We go forward.

302
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,466
SLOAN:
Next.

303
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:04,927
BASHIR:
Neral-- formerly
Proconsul

304
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:08,556
now Praetor of the
Romulan Star Empire.

305
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,224
Neral's ascension
to the top post

306
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,685
was confirmed
by the Continuing Committee

307
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,144
a little over a year ago.

308
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,605
His immediate family
was killed in a Klingon raid

309
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,482
approximately 25 years ago.

310
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:20,067
His interests include
sociology and archaeology.

311
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,820
His favorite food
is Delvan pudding

312
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,824
and his pet set'leth's name
is... Pensho.

313
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,283
Very good.

314
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,537
Total recall is a useful
attribute for an operative.

315
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,710
Koval-- chairman
of the Tal Shiar.

316
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,253
Section 31 believes that he
was involved in the death

317
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,630
of Vice Admiral
Fujisaki last year

318
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,715
but there's no proof.

319
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,049
The proof is buried

320
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,051
somewhere in Koval's
personal database

321
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,303
which puts it
out of our reach for now.

322
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,556
But believe me, Doctor,
the Deputy Chief

323
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:50,849
of Starfleet Intelligence

324
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:53,017
doesn't just die
of food poisoning.

325
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,228
I have to give him
credit, though.

326
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,896
It was a textbook operation.

327
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,898
No sign of foul play

328
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,942
and certainly no sign
of Romulan involvement.

329
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,903
It was very tidy.

330
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,864
Koval's political status?

331
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,448
Ambiguous.

332
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,492
He hasn't been elevated
to the Continuing Committee

333
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,952
which is usually a given
for the head of the Tal Shiar.

334
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,621
His nomination has
probably been held up

335
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,915
because of his opposition
to the Federation alliance

336
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,124
which is supported

337
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,918
by the majority
on the Committee.

338
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,046
Which, in turn, opens the door
for your friend, Senator Cretak.

339
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:25,216
She's an advocate
of the alliance

340
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,761
and she's been lobbying
for this open seat.

341
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,888
There is another rumor
about Koval

342
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,932
which is not contained
in his file.

343
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:37,270
We've heard he's ill--
something called Tuvan Syndrome.

344
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,354
I'm familiar with it.

345
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,022
It's a neurological disease

346
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,776
which affects mainly Vulcans,
Romulans, and Rigelians.

347
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,944
It's degenerative,
and incurable at present.

348
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,697
If Koval is ill,
he'll try to hide it.

349
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:50,491
It's a weakness, and
one that could hamper

350
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,869
his chances of being
appointed to the Committee.

351
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:56,414
Is that what I'm here for?
A diagnosis?

352
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:57,832
What's the matter, Sloan?

353
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,042
Doesn't Section 31
have its own doctors?

354
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,921
Our physicians weren't
genetically enhanced.

355
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:04,881
They need equipment
to make a diagnosis--

356
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:07,967
equipment that the
Romulans won't permit
at this conference.

357
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,094
I'm incapable
of making a diagnosis

358
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,763
by simply looking at a man.

359
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:14,223
Oh, your genetically-
enhanced friends

360
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,143
determined that Gul Damar
killed a woman

361
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:20,020
just by watching him
give a political speech.

362
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,857
I'm sure you can do
better than that.

363
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:27,153
You're going to make a move
against Koval, aren't you?

364
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,906
You're going to find
a way to use his illness

365
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,825
to keep him off
the Committee.

366
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,827
I suppose it would be
naive of me to point out

367
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,787
that interfering
in the internal affairs

368
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,288
of a sovereign power

369
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:40,082
is explicitly forbidden
by the Federation Charter.

370
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:43,920
Without confirming or denying
your speculation

371
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,131
I will say
that if Koval comes to power

372
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,257
it'd be a disaster

373
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,342
for the Federation.

374
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,885
He'll argue
for the Romulans

375
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,470
to abrogate the alliance

376
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,514
and negotiate a separate peace
with the Dominion

377
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,182
and I don't think
I need to tell you

378
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,058
what that would do
to the course of the war.

379
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,644
You can't justify that
by manipulating...

380
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,188
Let's make a deal, Doctor--

381
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,358
I'll spare you the ends-
justify-the-means speech

382
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,901
and you spare me

383
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,486
the we-must-do-
what's-right speech.

384
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,112
You and I are not
going to see

385
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,948
eye to eye on this subject

386
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,700
so I suggest
we stop discussing it.

387
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,911
This mission is reconnaissance.

388
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,454
We are not going
to be called upon

389
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,122
to do anything
other than that.

390
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,750
Now, why don't you
get some rest?

391
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,294
We'll be in orbit
of Romulus by 0600

392
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,547
and you will need to have
your wits about you.

393
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,551
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

394
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,488
Here you are, sir.

395
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,914
Dr. Julian Bashir?

396
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,707
Yes.

397
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,166
I understand
you were the officer

398
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,793
who first identified
the biogenic weapon

399
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:06,878
known as the Quickening.

400
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:08,170
That's right--

401
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,881
on Boranis III,
in the Gamma Quadrant.

402
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,966
I don't believe
we've been introduced.

403
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,760
Koval.

404
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,219
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

405
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,303
Why?

406
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,015
Well, you've got me there.

407
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,434
It's just a simple
form of expression, I suppose.

408
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,727
And like most
human expressions

409
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,687
completely devoid
of meaning.

410
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,857
Can the Dominion's
Quickening virus
be replicated?

411
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,359
We've had a little difficulty
in, uh, recreating

412
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,361
the exact RNA sequence
of the virus

413
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,822
which is why we've been
unable to develop a vaccine.

414
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,741
However, there are alternate
methods of making vaccines...

415
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:39,159
I'm not interested
in the vaccine.

416
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,828
I'm interested in the virus.

417
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,288
Do you know how
to introduce

418
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,748
the Quickening
into a population?

419
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,459
Basically.

420
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,752
Good.

421
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,503
I look forward to
hearing your lecture.

422
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:58,345
You're going to
make a very fine
operative, Doctor.

423
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,764
I beg your pardon?

424
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,181
The Chairman
of the Tal Shiar

425
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,017
rarely speaks with
anyone in public--

426
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,394
much less someone
wearing that uniform.

427
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,520
Starfleet Intelligence

428
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,230
should recruit you
immediately.

429
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,315
What makes you think

430
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,524
I'm not working
for them already?

431
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,276
Somehow, it wouldn't
surprise me

432
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,153
if half the people
in this room

433
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,863
turned out to be
operatives.

434
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,364
You are joking.

435
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,742
It may be impolitic
to say this

436
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,744
but there are those
who believe

437
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,579
the alliance
is merely a...

438
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,331
momentary truce.

439
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,791
And are you one of them?

440
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,459
Well, I could ask you
the same thing.

441
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,419
Well, in my case,
it's a firm "no"

442
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,838
but you've answered
my question--

443
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,047
with a question.

444
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,508
I try not to predict
the future.

445
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,301
What about Chairman Koval?

446
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,302
You tell me.

447
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,720
You just spoke with him.

448
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,681
That's more than I've
done in six months.

449
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,516
I take it you two
don't get along.

450
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,225
We have different views.

451
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,435
Which are?

452
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,773
State secrets.

453
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,232
(<i> chuckles</i> ):
Naturally.

454
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:57,404
BASHIR:
This is an adult female
inhabitant of Boranis III.

455
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:00,616
The markings on the face
are typical of a humanoid

456
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,242
who's been infected
by the disease

457
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:05,746
but who has not yet entered
the terminal stage.

458
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,790
In this next photograph

459
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,710
you can tell by the necrotic
nature of the lesions

460
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,212
that the patient has, indeed,
entered the terminal stage

461
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,380
of the disease.

462
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,923
This is also marked

463
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,467
by an increase
in leukocyte production.

464
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,011
WOMAN: Thank you, Doctor.

465
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,387
MAN: Excellent.

466
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,388
Thank you.

467
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,764
Very enlightening.

468
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,058
You almost made it
comprehensible.

469
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,350
Next time, I'll
do the lecture

470
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,476
with hand puppets
just for you.

471
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,435
Thank you very much.

472
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,562
I'm glad to see

473
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,189
you still have
your sense of humor.

474
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:34,150
I trust you noticed who was
sitting in the front row.

475
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,528
Yes. He came to see me this
morning between sessions.

476
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:40,114
He wanted to know more
about the Quickening--

477
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,366
specifically, if I knew
how to replicate the virus

478
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,284
and how to introduce it
into a population.

479
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,204
What did you think
of his health?

480
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:47,538
Didn't you hear
what I just said?

481
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,332
I heard you.

482
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,459
Koval wants to get his
hands on the Quickening.

483
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,461
That's not news to me

484
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,713
that the head
of the Tal Shiar

485
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,798
is interested in
biogenic weapons.

486
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,885
Pull your head out of the sand
and take a look around, Doctor.

487
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,554
These are not nice people
we're dealing with here.

488
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,223
Now answer my question.

489
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:08,184
His eyelids were
slightly displaced.

490
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,144
He had a noticeable weakness
in the facial muscles--

491
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,353
probably the result

492
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,064
of a compromised
neuromuscular function--

493
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:15,691
and his respiration
was somewhat irregular.

494
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,235
Bottom line.

495
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:18,819
He may have Tuvan Syndrome.

496
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,697
But if he does,
it's in the very early stages.

497
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,534
How long does he have?

498
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,621
If his case
fits the profile

499
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:32,041
he will start experiencing
a loss of motor skills

500
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,960
in ten to fifteen years--

501
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,546
with a life expectancy
in the 20 to 25-year range.

502
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,133
Are there instances
in which the disease

503
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,051
accelerates
without warning?

504
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:45,345
It happens, but in less than
five percent of the cases.

505
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:48,724
Is there anything that could
trigger the acceleration?

506
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:52,770
You know... I don't know
what you're asking me.

507
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,814
Never mind.

508
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,232
Thank you, Doctor.

509
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,025
You've been
very helpful.

510
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,490
This is unbelievable.

511
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,699
Let's put aside for the moment

512
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,367
that he's contemplating
the murder

513
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,494
of a high-ranking official.

514
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,537
What in the hell
makes him think

515
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,914
that the next head
of the Tal Shiar

516
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,624
would be any better
than Koval?

517
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,168
Well, Sloan's more
concerned with who gets

518
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,253
the empty seat on the
Continuing Committee.

519
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,879
He's hoping that
Cretak gets that.

520
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,756
Well, I sort of agree
with him there.

521
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,466
Cretak, for all
her abrasiveness

522
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,759
is at least a patriot.

523
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,803
What makes her any
different from Koval?

524
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,930
If you saw the reports
from Starfleet Intelligence

525
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,057
that I see, you would
never ask that question.

526
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,809
Koval would like
nothing better

527
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:34,728
than to see the Romulan
banner waving over Earth.

528
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:38,356
Believe me, Doctor,
Chairman Koval is not someone

529
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,734
we want to see
at the Praetor's right hand.

530
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,529
I'll have Sloan confined
to his quarters immediately

531
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,281
but that may not
solve our problem.

532
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,324
Sir?

533
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:49,869
Has it occurred to you

534
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,912
that you and Sloan may not
be the only ones here

535
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,207
working for Section 31?

536
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:56,458
For all we know,
he has a confederate

537
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,085
somewhere in the delegation.

538
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,461
Sloan did say
that our mission

539
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,214
would be strictly
reconnaissance--

540
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:03,299
that we wouldn't be called
upon to do anything else.

541
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,301
That could suggest
another operative--

542
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:07,427
someone whose mission<i> isn't</i> 
limited to reconnaissance.

543
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,429
If that's true,
it could be anyone--

544
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,557
even a member of
the<i> Bellerophon</i> crew.

545
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,517
Or a Romulan.

546
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,102
What?

547
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,771
Sir, I believe Sloan
has an accomplice

548
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,066
here... on Romulus.

549
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,275
What makes you say that?

550
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,485
Two things.

551
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,779
First, Sloan has
too much information

552
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,740
on the inner workings
of their government--

553
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,449
too many insights
into their

554
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:30,368
political process.

555
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:31,451
Second,

556
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:33,537
Sloan's plan is to kill Koval

557
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,830
while making it appear to be

558
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,749
an accelerated case
of Tuvan Syndrome.

559
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,625
Now, the only way to do that
would be to expose Koval

560
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,212
to a short burst
of nadion radiation.

561
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:44,673
The simplest plan would be to
maneuver him near a phaser relay

562
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,967
and surreptitiously
irradiate him.

563
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,053
Now, since I doubt very much

564
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,180
that Sloan is going to have
the chance to do that

565
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,141
it stands to reason someone else
is going to have to.

566
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,433
A Romulan?

567
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,936
Exactly.

568
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,939
Sir, Sloan may have already
gotten things underway.

569
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,690
We have to warn them.

570
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:05,569
And how am I supposed to explain
Section 31 to the Romulans?

571
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,654
All hell would break loose
if they hear

572
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,656
that there's a rogue
Federation agency running around

573
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,284
plotting assassinations.

574
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:13,660
It could bring
the alliance down.

575
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,913
Besides, all we have
is speculation

576
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:17,539
at this point.
Admiral...

577
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,832
The answer is no.

578
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,834
After I have
Sloan arrested

579
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,336
I'll break radio silence

580
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,462
and inform Starfleet Command
of the situation.

581
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:25,923
Your orders are to sit tight

582
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,841
and do nothing
until you hear from me.

583
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,260
Aye, sir.

584
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:33,306
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

585
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,487
MALE:
I don't know.

586
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,698
Jepella said she went
in to deliver a report

587
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,575
and found him slumped
over his desk.

588
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,453
Do they have any idea
what happened?

589
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:57,037
Dr. Frame said it looked
like an aneurysm

590
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,205
but they're still
running tests.

591
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,623
An aneurysm.

592
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,417
I saw the Admiral
this morning.
He looked fine.

593
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:02,835
They say that's
the way it happens.

594
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,128
Which Admiral are
you talking about?

595
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:06,130
Uh, Admiral Ross, sir.

596
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,256
He collapsed
at his desk.

597
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,299
Where is he?

598
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:09,633
Sick Bay.

599
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,720
(<i> female laughing</i> )

600
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,974
Hey.

601
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,335
I can't trust anybody
aboard the<i> Bellerophon.</i>

602
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:46,462
And I can't contact DS9.

603
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:49,465
For security reasons, there's
been a communications blackout.

604
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:52,092
Senator, I have no one
else to turn to.

605
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,093
I need your help.

606
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,678
To do what?

607
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,347
I have reason to believe

608
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:59,350
that Sloan has an accomplice
within the Romulan government.

609
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,852
Someone who's going to help him
carry out this assassination.

610
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:07,607
Koval has been saying
there's a traitor in the Senate.

611
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,902
Someone working for
Starfleet Intelligence.

612
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,945
Section 31 isn't part
of Starfleet Intelligence.

613
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,073
They are Federation
citizens working

614
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,657
to advance<i> your</i> interests.

615
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,868
That makes them
<i>your</i> responsibility.

616
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,537
You're absolutely right.

617
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:21,705
That's why I'm doing
everything I can to stop them.

618
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,123
I'm trying to convince Sloan

619
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,292
that Koval doesn't
have Tuvan Syndrome

620
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,087
but he may have already asked
his accomplice to proceed.

621
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,047
So if we want to be sure
to stop this assassination

622
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,508
we have to find Sloan's
Romulan accomplice.

623
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,552
And you expect<i> me</i>
to find this traitor.

624
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:37,471
Sloan said something about Koval
having a personal database.

625
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:38,805
It stands to reason

626
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,392
that it contains a list
of potential suspects.

627
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:42,809
Now, is there any possible way

628
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,437
you can get me
a copy of this database

629
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,272
so that I can run
an analysis of...

630
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:49,024
You are asking me to hand
over secret documents.

631
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,568
I'm asking you to put aside

632
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,610
three centuries of mistrust
between our peoples

633
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,447
and help me stop a murder.

634
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:57,491
Senator, if we can't reach out

635
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,034
and bridge the gulf
that is between us

636
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:02,620
if we can't trust each other,
a man will die

637
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,831
and we will be
partially responsible.

638
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,918
I need your help.

639
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,627
Please.

640
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,221
You wanted to
see me, Doctor?

641
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,931
Yes.

642
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:23,892
I'm not convinced that Koval is
suffering from Tuvan Syndrome.

643
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,269
His symptoms could
be the result

644
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:26,937
of any number of different
health problems.

645
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,023
You didn't say that before.

646
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,650
Well, I'm not an expert
on Romulan physiology.

647
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,694
Most of my knowledge
on Tuvan Syndrome

648
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,614
comes from studies
done on Vulcan patients.

649
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:37,906
I thought Vulcans

650
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:41,076
and Romulans
were virtually identical.

651
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,786
Yes, but there are

652
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,704
some important
genetic differences.

653
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,206
And the more I study

654
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,250
the available data
on Romulan physiology

655
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,668
the less sure I am that
my diagnosis was correct.

656
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:52,505
How could you find out
for sure?

657
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:54,465
The best way would be
to do an examination

658
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:56,383
but I hardly think
he'll agree to that.

659
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:59,470
What if you obtained
a sample of his skin cells?

660
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,472
Could you run an analysis?

661
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:03,390
Probably.

662
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,225
But how do you propose...

663
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:08,854
We'll treat your palm
with a microcellular adhesive.

664
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,606
The next time
you shake his hand

665
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,441
you'll get your sample.

666
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:16,111
All right.

667
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,341
Mr. Chairman.

668
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:39,385
What a pleasure
to see you again.

669
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:44,806
I'd be very happy to resume
our discussion on the Quickening

670
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,392
before this conference
is adjourned.

671
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,894
I believe you answered
all my questions, Doctor.

672
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:51,771
Well, I'm glad
to have been able to help.

673
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,982
Doctor, I would
like to have

674
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,443
a word with you
on another matter.

675
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,486
In private.

676
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:58,862
Of course.

677
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,614
I believe
the Lecture Hall's empty.

678
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,032
We have other,
more comfortable

679
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,659
facilities available,
if you please.

680
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:11,917
Sit down.

681
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,966
I can assure you that you
will be sitting in that chair

682
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,719
one way or the other, Doctor.

683
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:38,318
Now we'll have our private talk.

684
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,153
What shall we talk about?

685
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,239
Why you're really on Romulus.

686
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,823
Who you're working for,
and, of course

687
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:46,368
who's helping you.
Don't worry...

688
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,995
I won't waste your time
with pointless questions.

689
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,089
(<i> grunting</i> )

690
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:02,092
This can be painful or not.

691
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,719
That's up to you, Doctor.

692
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:07,013
Either way, I will know
what you know.

693
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,950
It appears that your brain's
neurocellular structure

694
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,244
is not susceptible to
our scanning techniques.

695
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,288
Evidently a result of
the genetic enhancements

696
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:33,206
made to your
parietal cortex.

697
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,500
Sorry.

698
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,710
I do have other methods
at my disposal

699
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,672
but it would save everyone
a great deal of trouble

700
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:41,799
if you would simply tell
me what I want to know.

701
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:44,050
You haven't asked me
any questions yet.

702
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,553
I think you know what
I'm interested in.

703
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,221
Who are you working for?

704
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,890
Why are you here?

705
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,603
Bring him.

706
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:05,197
ROMULAN:
Dr. Julian Bashir.

707
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,366
You are appearing before
the Continuing Committee

708
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,702
of the Romulan people.

709
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:12,412
Any statements will be made
part of the official record.

710
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:15,081
Senator Cretak
is charged with attempting

711
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,167
to access a
Tal Shiar database

712
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,085
without proper
authorization.

713
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,004
The Senator has told

714
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:24,466
the Committee
a remarkable story.

715
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:27,344
Since you are a key figure
in her story

716
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:28,595
we are most eager

717
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,639
to hear your
version of events.

718
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,315
What I am about to say
may be shocking.

719
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,484
It may even damage the relations

720
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,820
between our
two peoples

721
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,154
but it's the truth.

722
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,493
A few days ago,
I became aware of a plot

723
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,495
to assassinate Chairman Koval.

724
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:56,331
It was conceived of
by a man known to me

725
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,875
only as "Sloan."

726
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:02,128
He works for an organization
called Section 31.

727
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:06,007
They see themselves
as protecting the interests

728
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,300
of the Federation

729
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,636
although they
have absolutely

730
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,764
no official standing.

731
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:16,727
Once I realized what Sloan
was attempting to do

732
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:19,730
I contacted Senator Cretak

733
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:23,108
in order to enlist her
aid in stopping him.

734
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:24,526
Why her?

735
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:26,986
I had no one else
to turn to.

736
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,907
I was unable to contact
Deep Space Nine

737
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:32,910
and I couldn't trust anybody
aboard the<i> Bellerophon.</i>

738
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:36,121
But you felt that you could
trust a Romulan Senator?

739
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,456
Yes.

740
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,833
For all our differences,

741
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:40,918
I do respect her.

742
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,046
Continue.

743
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,591
For reasons that are
extremely complicated

744
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:49,008
I came to believe

745
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,719
that there's a traitor
in your government

746
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:52,721
working for Section 31.

747
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:55,014
I asked the Senator
to obtain the database

748
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,809
so that we could
expose this person

749
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:58,936
and prevent the
assassination.

750
00:32:58,936 --> 00:33:00,395
PRAETOR:
Senator Cretak,

751
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,147
why didn't you come to me

752
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,107
with this information?

753
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:07,986
I was afraid that if word
of this... "plot" got out

754
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,113
it would destroy
the alliance.

755
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,240
I decided to keep
my own counsel.

756
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,369
I regret that decision.

757
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,914
As well you
should, Kimara.

758
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:21,667
It's an interesting story

759
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,836
but it's not
the whole story.

760
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:26,129
If I may be permitted
to bring in another witness?

761
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,090
(<i> com beep</i> )

762
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,759
Bring in prisoner 527.

763
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:37,975
Praetor

764
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:40,560
this is the man
known as "Sloan."

765
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,437
Unlike the Doctor,
his mind is

766
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,106
quite susceptible
to our data-retrieval methods.

767
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,608
Under questioning,
he has confirmed

768
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:48,735
much of what the Doctor
and the Senator have told you

769
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,904
with one
important exception--

770
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:53,072
there<i> is</i> no Section 31.

771
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:56,869
Sloan, in fact, works
for Starfleet Intelligence.

772
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:59,579
Far from being the master
of a rogue agency

773
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,289
he is simply one
of many operatives

774
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,041
in the employ
of the Federation.

775
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,251
He's had a long career.

776
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,462
Most of which
is still unknown to us.

777
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,715
However, there is one
interesting element

778
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:12,133
that we do know--
he was the protégé

779
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,260
of the late
Vice Admiral Fujisaki.

780
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,430
Sloan did not take
the death of his mentor well.

781
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,682
He came to believe

782
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:20,350
he was murdered
by the Tal Shiar.

783
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,853
In his eyes,
the assassination

784
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:26,481
of a Starfleet Admiral was
"stepping over the line."

785
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,525
Isn't that the phrase?

786
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:32,863
After Fujisaki's death, he
was confronted with a dilemma.

787
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:34,907
How could he seek vengeance

788
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:37,283
without violating
the Federation's laws?

789
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:39,745
His answer was
to invent Section 31--

790
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:42,956
a rogue organization
that answered to no one.

791
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:44,374
If they killed
the head

792
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:46,376
of the Tal Shiar,
Starfleet Intelligence

793
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:47,836
would be held
blameless.

794
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,380
As the Committee knows

795
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,050
I have been diagnosed
with Tuvan Syndrome.

796
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,801
Sloan became aware
of my condition

797
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,261
and hoped to make my death

798
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,221
look like a sudden
acceleration of the disease.

799
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:01,058
To do that,
he needed a doctor.

800
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:05,687
Sloan arranged to recruit
Dr. Bashir into Section 31.

801
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:09,024
After that, Sloan
bided his time

802
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:11,401
and waited for an opportunity
to present itself.

803
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,820
He found one when he learned
of this conference.

804
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,323
He then arranged
for Bashir to be invited.

805
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,867
Everything was
going perfectly

806
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:22,829
but then he made
a fatal mistake.

807
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,582
He decided to come
to Romulus himself.

808
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:27,417
He was unaware
that his identity

809
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:28,627
had become known to us.

810
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,754
Once we recognized him
in the delegation

811
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,130
we knew immediately

812
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,590
that an intelligence
operation was underway.

813
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:37,970
What I don't understand
is... why?

814
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:40,639
Why did you come here and take
the risk of being discovered?

815
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,727
I had to make sure
nothing went wrong

816
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:49,648
and I wanted to watch you die...

817
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:53,485
You broke the cardinal
rule of our profession.

818
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,862
You allowed business
to become personal.

819
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:59,950
So there was an
assassination plan?

820
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:02,201
Most definitely.

821
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,997
As to the involvement
of the Doctor and the Senator

822
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:07,457
Dr. Bashir may have
intended to kill me

823
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:08,959
or he may have
intended to save me.

824
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,752
There is no way to
know for certain.

825
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:12,671
As for Senator Cretak

826
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,881
we all know she's
an ambitious woman.

827
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,299
It is entirely
possible, she would

828
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,968
welcome my death,
especially if it meant

829
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,095
her being elevated
to the Continuing Committee

830
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,262
in my place.

831
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,473
That is a lie, Koval.

832
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,142
I was trying to save your life.

833
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:26,184
Well, then, you're

834
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,769
simply a fool.

835
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:30,022
You let a Starfleet Intelligence
officer manipulate you

836
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:32,065
into committing
an act of treason.

837
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,074
PRAETOR:
It is the finding

838
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:45,662
of this Committee that
Senator Cretak has conspired

839
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,497
to commit treason
against the state.

840
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:49,875
Sentence to be determined
at a later date.

841
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,544
Dr. Bashir will
be returned

842
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:53,461
to the<i> Bellerophon.</i>

843
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,131
Mr. Sloan...

844
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:58,508
is remanded to the custody
of the Tal Shiar

845
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:00,093
for further
interrogation.

846
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,178
No!

847
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,248
(<i> door chimes</i> )

848
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,708
Come in.

849
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,003
Admiral.

850
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:36,421
Doctor.

851
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,008
Feeling, uh, better, sir?

852
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,300
Much.

853
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,887
Dr. Frame tells me
that I should take it easy

854
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,346
for a few days,
but, uh... paperwork

855
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,973
waits for no man.

856
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,391
What can I
do for you?

857
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,601
I have a question.

858
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,144
Where's Sloan?

859
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,646
Sloan's dead.

860
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:57,859
Admiral... where's Sloan?

861
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:04,323
If we're going to have
this discussion

862
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,951
then it's off the record.

863
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:15,043
But before I answer your
question, answer mine.

864
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,213
How did you know?

865
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,757
The man Koval described
was not the same man

866
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:23,843
who recruited me
into Section 31.

867
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,763
Anyone clever enough
to pull the wool

868
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:28,223
so completely over my eyes

869
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,682
wouldn't have
been caught

870
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,226
by the Romulans
so easily.

871
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,603
There had to be
another explanation.

872
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:36,815
And then I remembered
that<i> you</i> were the one

873
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,984
who planted the idea
in my head

874
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:41,569
that Sloan had an accomplice.

875
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,281
You were the one who didn't
want to tell the Romulans

876
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:46,199
that there was
an assassination plot.

877
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:49,119
You were the one
who issued the orders

878
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,496
preventing me from
contacting Deep Space Nine.

879
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:56,293
And when the time
came to arrest Sloan

880
00:38:56,293 --> 00:39:02,966
you conveniently had an
aneurysm... leaving me alone

881
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:06,845
with no one to turn to
for help, except Cretak

882
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,681
and as I realized
your involvement

883
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:12,809
the rest began to
fall into place.

884
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,435
Where is he?

885
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,939
I don't know.

886
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:21,067
But he's alive...
isn't he?

887
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,820
He was supposed
to be beamed away

888
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,114
a split second
before the phaser beam hit him.

889
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:30,035
Whether it worked or not,
I couldn't say.

890
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,037
How long has Koval

891
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:34,247
been working
for Starfleet?

892
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:36,082
He's been providing
the Federation

893
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:40,170
with critical military
intelligence for over a year.

894
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:44,507
When he started working
with Section 31, I don't know.

895
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:48,303
But in any case,
we have our mole--

896
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,096
working for us

897
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,974
at the top levels
of Romulan government.

898
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:55,476
Good for us.

899
00:39:57,229 --> 00:40:01,566
And what about your friend,
Senator Cretak?

900
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:04,277
What's going
to happen to her?

901
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:06,696
Dismissed from
the Senate...

902
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:08,365
definitely.

903
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:10,116
Imprisoned,
most likely.

904
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,118
Executed?

905
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,205
I hope not.

906
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:17,249
You set her up!

907
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:20,377
She was an innocent woman
and you let Sloan destroy her.

908
00:40:20,377 --> 00:40:21,378
Why?

909
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:24,297
She believed
in the alliance.

910
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,759
She was on our side.

911
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,012
No, she wasn't.

912
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,597
I told you before, Julian--

913
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:33,723
she's a patriot,

914
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:34,807
which means if it serves

915
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,475
the interests
of the Romulans

916
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,561
to negotiate a separate
peace with the Dominion,

917
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,980
Cretak would push that option.

918
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,900
And believe me, the Dominion
would like nothing more

919
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,361
than to make a deal with
the Romulans right now.

920
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:49,739
So, Koval becomes your guarantee
that that does not happen

921
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:50,949
and as a man
who was nearly killed

922
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,450
for his anti-Federation
activities

923
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,952
his recommendation
to stay in the war

924
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,203
becomes all
the more convincing.

925
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:56,871
That's the general idea.

926
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,207
And how long
have you worked

927
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:00,208
for Section 31?

928
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,376
I don't.

929
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,544
Oh, just a temporary
alliance, is it?

930
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,130
Something like that.

931
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:08,300
You don't see anything wrong
with what happened, do you?

932
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,802
I don't like it

933
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,887
but I've spent the last
year and a half of my life

934
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,847
ordering young men and
young women to die.

935
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,391
I like that even less.

936
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,435
That's a glib answer

937
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:21,146
and a cheap way
to avoid the fact

938
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,480
that you've trampled
on the very thing

939
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,940
that those young
men and women

940
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,483
are out there dying to protect!

941
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,610
Does that not mean
anything to you?!

942
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,696
<i>Inter arma</i>
<i>enim silent leges.</i>

943
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:33,825
"In time of war,
the law falls silent."

944
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,576
Cicero.

945
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,204
So, is that what
we have become--

946
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,998
a 24th-century Rome

947
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:42,375
driven by nothing other
than the certainty

948
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,836
that Caesar can
do no wrong?!

949
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:49,548
This conversation
never happened.

950
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,887
You're dismissed.

951
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:21,747
Good evening.

952
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:25,502
Are you expecting applause?

953
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:28,004
Have you come to take a bow?

954
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:31,132
I just wanted to say thank you.

955
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:32,758
For what?

956
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:36,804
Allowing you to manipulate
me so completely?

957
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,433
For being a decent human being.

958
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:43,936
That's why we selected you
in the first place, Doctor.

959
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:47,273
We needed somebody
who wanted to play the game

960
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,192
but who'd only go so far.

961
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:52,404
When the time came,
you stood your ground.

962
00:42:52,404 --> 00:42:53,654
You did the right thing.

963
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,614
You reached out
to an enemy.

964
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:56,741
You told her the truth.

965
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,701
You tried to
stop a murder.

966
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,704
The Federation needs
men like you, Doctor.

967
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:04,082
Men of conscience.
Men of principle.

968
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:06,042
Men who can sleep at night.

969
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:08,127
You're also
the reason

970
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,713
Section 31 exists.

971
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:13,299
Someone has to protect
men like you

972
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:16,302
from a universe
that doesn't share your sense

973
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,513
of right
and wrong.

974
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,473
Should I feel sorry for you?

975
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:22,641
Should I be weeping

976
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,352
over the burden
you're forced to carry

977
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:26,312
in order to protect
the rest of us?

978
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:33,652
It is an honor
to know you, Doctor.

979
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,115
Good night.

980
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:41,994
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

981
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:48,042
Bashir to Security.

982
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,586
Odo, here.

983
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,549
Never mind.

984
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:57,843
My mistake.

985
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:09,522
(<i> sighs</i> )
