1
00:00:02,196 --> 00:00:03,756
All right, next item.

2
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:06,999
Item seven,
warbird repair and maintenance.

3
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:08,098
Senator?

4
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:09,109
Repairs on our ships

5
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:10,441
have continually been delayed

6
00:00:10,479 --> 00:00:12,949
in favor of Klingon
and Federation vessels.

7
00:00:12,984 --> 00:00:14,316
The <i>Dividices</i>

8
00:00:14,353 --> 00:00:16,482
and the <i>Genorex</i> have been
waiting almost three weeks

9
00:00:16,525 --> 00:00:18,518
while more than
a dozen Klingon ships

10
00:00:18,562 --> 00:00:20,725
have been given first priority.

11
00:00:20,767 --> 00:00:22,167
Well, I make up
the repair schedule

12
00:00:22,202 --> 00:00:23,329
according to my assessment

13
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:25,068
of which ships have
the greatest need.

14
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,510
Odd that the Klingons
seem to always have

15
00:00:27,547 --> 00:00:28,913
the greatest need.

16
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:30,578
They are usually more damaged

17
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,852
because Klingon warships
are relentless

18
00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:34,086
in pressing home their attack.

19
00:00:34,126 --> 00:00:36,221
"Reckless" would be
another way of putting it.

20
00:00:36,297 --> 00:00:38,096
The fight must be taken
to the enemy.

21
00:00:38,134 --> 00:00:39,865
We cannot win this war...

22
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:41,738
All right, we're not here
to debate combat tactics.

23
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,211
Chief, how soon can you have
those warbirds

24
00:00:44,246 --> 00:00:45,475
into a docking bay?

25
00:00:45,515 --> 00:00:47,382
Well, I suppose I could
bring them in tomorrow.

26
00:00:47,419 --> 00:00:48,614
But that would mean delaying

27
00:00:48,656 --> 00:00:51,253
repairs to the <i>Hornet</i>
and the <i>Rotarran.</i>

28
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:53,126
Somebody's going
to have to explain

29
00:00:53,164 --> 00:00:55,795
to General Martok
why his flagship was bumped.

30
00:00:55,837 --> 00:00:59,743
Worf, you just volunteered
for that assignment.

31
00:00:59,778 --> 00:01:03,182
This brings up the
question of shore leave.

32
00:01:03,218 --> 00:01:05,381
At the moment, we have the crews

33
00:01:05,422 --> 00:01:07,756
from two Klingon ships
on the station.

34
00:01:07,794 --> 00:01:11,495
I'd rather not have that
many Klingons and Romulans

35
00:01:11,534 --> 00:01:13,504
on the Promenade
at the same time.

36
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:16,066
We'll forgo shore leave
until the Klingons depart.

37
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,239
Our soldiers are professionals.

38
00:01:18,314 --> 00:01:20,011
They're here to fight

39
00:01:20,051 --> 00:01:22,453
not to get drunk in Quark's.

40
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:24,425
All right.
That's it for today then.

41
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,792
Same time next week?

42
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,798
Oh, sorry, Senator.

43
00:01:26,832 --> 00:01:28,358
You'll be attending
that conference

44
00:01:28,401 --> 00:01:29,562
on Romulus, won't you?

45
00:01:29,604 --> 00:01:32,599
Yes, but Subcommander Velal
will be here in my place.

46
00:01:32,644 --> 00:01:34,273
Fine. Have a safe trip.

47
00:01:34,346 --> 00:01:35,609
Thank you.

48
00:01:38,455 --> 00:01:40,516
Ah, yes.

49
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:41,754
Romulus...

50
00:01:41,795 --> 00:01:43,286
how well I remember it.

51
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:46,929
You'll find the predominant
color to be gray...

52
00:01:46,972 --> 00:01:49,306
the buildings, the
clothes, the people.

53
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:52,281
Did you know that the Romulan
heart itself is gray?

54
00:01:52,316 --> 00:01:53,545
It's true.

55
00:01:53,585 --> 00:01:56,614
And altogether appropriate
for such an unimaginative race.

56
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,892
I take it you didn't enjoy
your brief stint on Romulus.

57
00:01:59,931 --> 00:02:02,698
You were... posing
as a gardener, weren't you?

58
00:02:02,737 --> 00:02:04,137
It was one of the few instances

59
00:02:04,173 --> 00:02:06,439
where my cover
was more enjoyable

60
00:02:06,477 --> 00:02:07,604
than the actual assignment.

61
00:02:07,647 --> 00:02:09,241
What was the assignment anyway?

62
00:02:09,283 --> 00:02:11,617
I'm afraid
I can't talk about that.

63
00:02:11,655 --> 00:02:13,522
Back to the subject at hand.

64
00:02:13,558 --> 00:02:16,655
What would your role be
at this conference?

65
00:02:16,698 --> 00:02:19,499
Well, I'll be giving a talk
on Dominion biogenic weapons

66
00:02:19,537 --> 00:02:22,007
chairing a seminar
on ketracel-white

67
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:24,239
and attending a meeting
on a proposal

68
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,845
to transfer 25
Federation hospital ships

69
00:02:27,887 --> 00:02:29,516
over to Romulan control.

70
00:02:29,557 --> 00:02:30,684
How dull.

71
00:02:30,726 --> 00:02:31,785
Sorry to disappoint.

72
00:02:31,828 --> 00:02:33,023
Admiral Ross and his staff

73
00:02:33,064 --> 00:02:35,296
will be discussing the
"exciting" military issues.

74
00:02:35,335 --> 00:02:37,066
I see.

75
00:02:37,105 --> 00:02:39,200
I-I trust that
Starfleet Intelligence

76
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:40,609
will be sending someone along

77
00:02:40,645 --> 00:02:43,344
to make good use
of this opportunity.

78
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:44,544
What do you mean?

79
00:02:44,587 --> 00:02:45,646
Well, isn't it obvious?

80
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,124
This is a golden opportunity

81
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:50,256
to gather intelligence
on Romulan intentions

82
00:02:50,298 --> 00:02:51,766
and military capabilities.

83
00:02:51,802 --> 00:02:53,465
They're our allies, Garak.

84
00:02:53,504 --> 00:02:54,733
And with any luck

85
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,937
this could be the beginning
of an entirely new friendship

86
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:58,106
between our peoples.

87
00:02:58,147 --> 00:03:00,117
The eternal optimist.

88
00:03:00,151 --> 00:03:01,312
Guilty as charged.

89
00:03:01,354 --> 00:03:02,720
How sad.

90
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:04,556
I must tell you,
I'm disappointed

91
00:03:04,593 --> 00:03:07,497
at hearing you mouth
the usual platitudes

92
00:03:07,532 --> 00:03:08,864
of peace and friendship

93
00:03:08,902 --> 00:03:13,343
regarding an implacable foe
like the Romulans.

94
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:17,544
But I live in hope that one day

95
00:03:17,586 --> 00:03:21,492
you'll come to see this universe
for what it truly is

96
00:03:21,527 --> 00:03:24,260
rather than what
you'd wish it to be.

97
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:26,667
Well, I shall endeavor
to become more cynical

98
00:03:26,704 --> 00:03:28,367
with each passing day.

99
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:31,173
Look gift horses
squarely in the mouth

100
00:03:31,213 --> 00:03:34,778
and find clouds in
every silver lining.

101
00:03:34,821 --> 00:03:37,850
If only you meant it.

102
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:51,982
Lights.

103
00:03:53,926 --> 00:03:55,793
Sloan.

104
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,390
Hello, Doctor.

105
00:03:57,432 --> 00:03:58,832
It's good to see you.

106
00:03:58,869 --> 00:04:01,237
I hope you're well rested.

107
00:04:01,273 --> 00:04:04,177
Section 31 has
an assignment for you.

108
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,199
You're taking quite a risk.

109
00:06:04,242 --> 00:06:06,212
I could have a security team
here in 30 seconds.

110
00:06:06,246 --> 00:06:08,648
I suspect
you'd be unable to communicate

111
00:06:08,684 --> 00:06:10,210
with anyone
outside of this room.

112
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:11,883
I could scream for help.

113
00:06:11,924 --> 00:06:12,892
Possible

114
00:06:12,926 --> 00:06:14,189
but uncharacteristic.

115
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:15,594
I mean, screaming for help...

116
00:06:15,631 --> 00:06:17,999
that's... that's
too undignified for you.

117
00:06:18,036 --> 00:06:19,903
But don't let me stop you.

118
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,408
I enjoy being wrong.

119
00:06:21,443 --> 00:06:22,411
What do you want?

120
00:06:22,445 --> 00:06:23,208
I told you.

121
00:06:23,246 --> 00:06:24,407
You have an assignment.

122
00:06:24,515 --> 00:06:26,144
I don't work for you.

123
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,245
You passed the test.

124
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:29,417
You were accepted
into the organization.

125
00:06:29,492 --> 00:06:31,894
I didn't ask to be accepted.

126
00:06:31,931 --> 00:06:33,194
You were nevertheless.

127
00:06:34,836 --> 00:06:37,433
And now it's time to go to work.

128
00:06:37,475 --> 00:06:40,003
I'm sure you're dying to know
what your mission is

129
00:06:40,047 --> 00:06:41,710
but you won't give me
the satisfaction

130
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,718
of admitting it.

131
00:06:42,752 --> 00:06:45,781
So I'll just tell you.

132
00:06:45,824 --> 00:06:46,814
Lucky me.

133
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,459
Section 31
is extremely interested

134
00:06:50,534 --> 00:06:52,561
in this conference of yours.

135
00:06:52,605 --> 00:06:54,336
However, the Tal Shiar

136
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,709
will be handling
the security arrangements

137
00:06:56,746 --> 00:06:58,340
so we'll have virtually
no chance

138
00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:01,878
of using any technical assets
to gather intelligence.

139
00:07:01,924 --> 00:07:05,864
As a result, we'll be forced
to rely on organic assets...

140
00:07:05,898 --> 00:07:07,127
like you.

141
00:07:07,168 --> 00:07:10,402
Your mission is to gather data

142
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,034
about the Romulan leadership.

143
00:07:12,077 --> 00:07:13,603
In essence, we want you

144
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:16,083
to take the pulse
of their government.

145
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:18,089
No pun intended.

146
00:07:18,123 --> 00:07:21,254
You want me to spy on an ally?

147
00:07:21,296 --> 00:07:24,200
To evaluate an ally.

148
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,832
And a temporary ally at that.

149
00:07:26,873 --> 00:07:30,209
Now, I say that, because
when the war is over

150
00:07:30,247 --> 00:07:32,615
the following will happen
in short order...

151
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:36,112
the Dominion will be forced
back to the Gamma Quadrant.

152
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:39,325
The Cardassian Empire
will be occupied.

153
00:07:39,365 --> 00:07:42,599
The Klingon Empire will spend
the next ten years recovering

154
00:07:42,638 --> 00:07:45,439
from the war and won't pose
a serious threat to anyone.

155
00:07:45,477 --> 00:07:49,918
That leaves two powers to vie
for control of the Quadrant...

156
00:07:49,952 --> 00:07:53,824
the Federation and the Romulans.

157
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,523
This war isn't over

158
00:07:55,631 --> 00:07:59,162
and you're already
planning for the next.

159
00:07:59,205 --> 00:08:00,366
Well put.

160
00:08:00,407 --> 00:08:03,470
I hope your report
is equally succinct.

161
00:08:03,513 --> 00:08:05,574
How many times do I have
to tell you, Sloan?

162
00:08:05,617 --> 00:08:07,951
I don't work for you.

163
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:09,583
You will.

164
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,061
It's in your nature.

165
00:08:12,097 --> 00:08:15,365
You are a man
who loves secrets...

166
00:08:16,673 --> 00:08:19,166
medical, personal, fictional.

167
00:08:19,211 --> 00:08:22,672
And I am a man of secrets.

168
00:08:22,718 --> 00:08:27,524
You want to know what I know
and the only way to do that

169
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:29,427
is to accept the assignment.

170
00:08:46,499 --> 00:08:48,662
Whoa! Easy, Julian.

171
00:08:48,703 --> 00:08:50,434
What's going on?

172
00:08:55,317 --> 00:08:57,082
Odo's checked
all the security logs.

173
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:58,089
There's no indication

174
00:08:58,123 --> 00:09:00,093
of how Sloan got aboard
or where he went.

175
00:09:00,127 --> 00:09:01,459
I can't say I'm surprised.

176
00:09:01,496 --> 00:09:03,022
From what we've seen of them

177
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:06,038
Section 31 is very meticulous
in covering its tracks.

178
00:09:06,072 --> 00:09:09,374
I had a conversation with
Admiral Ross this afternoon.

179
00:09:09,412 --> 00:09:12,213
He and I both agree
that the Romulan conference

180
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,880
is too important to cancel.

181
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,549
What about me?

182
00:09:15,657 --> 00:09:17,023
Starfleet Command has promised

183
00:09:17,061 --> 00:09:19,258
to send the expert
on Dominion biogenic weapons

184
00:09:19,298 --> 00:09:22,099
and ketracel-white
to the conference.

185
00:09:22,137 --> 00:09:24,232
Since that's you, you go.

186
00:09:24,275 --> 00:09:26,677
And we want you to carry out
your assignment.

187
00:09:26,712 --> 00:09:29,240
Make a few discreet observations
on the Romulan leadership

188
00:09:29,285 --> 00:09:32,314
and then wait for Sloan
to contact you again.

189
00:09:32,357 --> 00:09:33,825
Somehow, I don't
think giving Sloan

190
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,796
any information is a good idea.

191
00:09:35,831 --> 00:09:39,362
That was my instinct as well,
but after talking to Ross

192
00:09:39,405 --> 00:09:42,206
I think we might have
an opportunity here

193
00:09:42,244 --> 00:09:44,407
we can turn to our advantage.

194
00:09:44,448 --> 00:09:46,008
Officially, Starfleet Command

195
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:48,750
has said that they are appalled
at the very notion

196
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,785
that an organization like
Section 31 might exist

197
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:52,990
and that they plan

198
00:09:53,031 --> 00:09:56,003
to get to the bottom
of this entire business.

199
00:09:56,037 --> 00:09:57,563
And unofficially?

200
00:09:57,608 --> 00:10:00,842
They have quietly
pushed the investigation aside.

201
00:10:00,881 --> 00:10:04,616
Which means either they
don't take Section 31 seriously

202
00:10:04,655 --> 00:10:08,186
or... someone at Starfleet
Command is protecting them.

203
00:10:08,229 --> 00:10:12,567
Either way, we now have a chance
to get someone inside

204
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:15,074
and I think I want to take it.

205
00:10:15,109 --> 00:10:16,509
So you want me to play along?

206
00:10:16,546 --> 00:10:20,041
Pretend that I've decided
to work for Sloan after all?

207
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:21,314
Exactly.

208
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:23,348
When he contacts you to find out

209
00:10:23,393 --> 00:10:24,827
what you learned
at the conference

210
00:10:24,862 --> 00:10:27,128
make it seem like
you've reluctantly come around

211
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:28,499
to his way of thinking.

212
00:10:28,536 --> 00:10:31,099
Let him believe
that he has seduced you

213
00:10:31,142 --> 00:10:32,110
into helping him.

214
00:10:32,144 --> 00:10:33,943
Well, that shouldn't
be too difficult.

215
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,677
Sloan thinks
I'm already so tempted

216
00:10:35,717 --> 00:10:37,516
that I barely can see straight.

217
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,151
Well, listen, I better pack.

218
00:10:40,193 --> 00:10:42,390
The <i>Bellerophon</i> leaves
in three hours.

219
00:10:42,431 --> 00:10:44,833
One more thing, Doctor.

220
00:10:44,868 --> 00:10:46,963
Remember this isn't a game.

221
00:10:47,006 --> 00:10:49,569
Section 31 is very dangerous.

222
00:10:49,612 --> 00:10:52,345
If Sloan even suspects
that you are really

223
00:10:52,384 --> 00:10:53,409
working for us...

224
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:54,443
I understand.

225
00:10:58,963 --> 00:11:00,056
Good hunting.

226
00:11:12,924 --> 00:11:14,860
A glass of Romulan ale,
Doctor?

227
00:11:14,895 --> 00:11:15,920
Thank you, Senator.

228
00:11:15,964 --> 00:11:17,432
The trading embargo
has been officially lifted

229
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:18,435
if you were wondering.

230
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,371
It hadn't crossed
my mind, actually.

231
00:11:20,407 --> 00:11:23,311
To one of the many benefits
of the alliance.

232
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:29,421
Need a medical team, sir?

233
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,756
No, thank you.

234
00:11:30,794 --> 00:11:33,391
Don't tell me this is
your first glass of Romulan ale.

235
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:34,765
Well, it was...

236
00:11:35,804 --> 00:11:37,535
ille... illegal.

237
00:11:37,574 --> 00:11:39,008
That never stopped
most of your colleagues.

238
00:11:39,043 --> 00:11:41,104
I know... I was probably

239
00:11:41,147 --> 00:11:42,445
one of the few officers
in the fleet

240
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:44,283
who didn't indulge occasionally.

241
00:11:45,323 --> 00:11:46,655
Would you like something else?

242
00:11:46,692 --> 00:11:47,717
No, no, I'll manage.

243
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:49,424
That's the spirit, sir.
Never say die.

244
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,491
What an odd expression.

245
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:53,698
What does it mean?

246
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,371
It's a line
from an old Earth poem.

247
00:11:56,412 --> 00:11:59,043
Forgive me for interrupting.

248
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,312
I couldn't help overhearing

249
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,881
and etymology is
one of my hobbies.

250
00:12:02,924 --> 00:12:07,058
The, uh, phrase "never
say die" is originally

251
00:12:07,099 --> 00:12:10,003
from a 19th century poem

252
00:12:10,038 --> 00:12:11,667
based on Shakespeare's
<i>Merchant of Venice.</i>

253
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:15,274
Now, it's since passed
into the vernacular

254
00:12:15,316 --> 00:12:18,083
as a, as an exhortation
never to give up

255
00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:19,681
no matter the cost.

256
00:12:19,725 --> 00:12:20,988
Interesting.

257
00:12:21,027 --> 00:12:23,224
Wendell Greer,
Assistant Director

258
00:12:23,266 --> 00:12:25,794
UFP Department of Cartography.

259
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:26,963
It's a pleasure.

260
00:12:27,006 --> 00:12:28,942
Admiral William Ross,
Senator Cretak.

261
00:12:28,976 --> 00:12:30,912
Admiral... Senator.

262
00:12:30,947 --> 00:12:32,279
And Dr. Julian Bashir.

263
00:12:32,317 --> 00:12:35,984
Ah, the physician
from Deep Space 9.

264
00:12:36,024 --> 00:12:37,515
I was hoping to meet you.

265
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:40,829
I have so many questions
about the Bajoran sector...

266
00:12:40,867 --> 00:12:44,500
navigational anomalies,
the transport patterns...

267
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,009
Could you spare a moment?

268
00:12:46,044 --> 00:12:47,707
Unless I'm interrupting.

269
00:12:47,747 --> 00:12:48,942
Not at all.

270
00:12:53,124 --> 00:12:54,217
Try to play your cards

271
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,162
a little closer
to your vest, Doctor.

272
00:12:56,197 --> 00:12:59,363
You're lucky they didn't see
that look of shock on your face.

273
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,001
You managed to get yourself
attached to this delegation.

274
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:03,271
Why do you need me?

275
00:13:03,312 --> 00:13:04,644
All in due time.

276
00:13:04,681 --> 00:13:07,710
Now you have a lot of work to do
before we arrive at Romulus.

277
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:10,247
There's a padd
in your quarters... read it.

278
00:13:10,293 --> 00:13:12,195
I'll join you at 2200.

279
00:13:16,137 --> 00:13:18,607
Well, Mr. Greer certainly
has his ducks in a row.

280
00:13:18,643 --> 00:13:20,840
According to the Department
of Cartography

281
00:13:20,947 --> 00:13:23,646
he's been a low-level bureaucrat
for almost 15 years.

282
00:13:23,686 --> 00:13:26,214
Well, it doesn't surprise me
he has a solid cover story, sir.

283
00:13:26,257 --> 00:13:28,591
But I think it's too dangerous
to allow him to participate

284
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:30,758
in the conference
or even set foot on Romulus.

285
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,995
We don't know what he's up to.

286
00:13:32,036 --> 00:13:34,063
On the other hand,
if we move against him now

287
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:37,101
we lose any hope
of penetrating Section 31.

288
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:39,982
His access at this conference
will be limited

289
00:13:40,018 --> 00:13:41,988
to a few low-level
briefings and seminars.

290
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,889
It shouldn't be too hard
keeping tabs on him.

291
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,453
If Sloan's here...

292
00:13:46,498 --> 00:13:48,730
it suggests something
more important

293
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:51,171
than a simple intelligence-
gathering mission.

294
00:13:51,207 --> 00:13:53,302
He's up to something

295
00:13:53,346 --> 00:13:56,113
and it's imperative that we
know what that something is.

296
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,713
We go forward.

297
00:13:59,992 --> 00:14:01,324
Next.

298
00:14:01,362 --> 00:14:04,857
Neral... formerly Proconsul

299
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:08,396
now Praetor
of the Romulan Star Empire.

300
00:14:08,442 --> 00:14:10,105
Neral's ascension
to the top post

301
00:14:10,145 --> 00:14:11,842
was confirmed
by the Continuing Committee

302
00:14:11,882 --> 00:14:13,111
a little over a year ago.

303
00:14:13,151 --> 00:14:15,621
His immediate family
was killed in a Klingon raid

304
00:14:15,657 --> 00:14:17,354
approximately 25 years ago.

305
00:14:17,394 --> 00:14:20,059
His interests include
sociology and archaeology.

306
00:14:20,098 --> 00:14:21,727
His favorite food
is Delvan pudding

307
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:26,073
and his pet set'leth's name
is... Pensho.

308
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,169
Very good.

309
00:14:27,212 --> 00:14:30,548
Total recall is a useful
attribute for an operative.

310
00:14:33,993 --> 00:14:36,590
Koval... chairman
of the Tal Shiar.

311
00:14:36,632 --> 00:14:39,229
Section 31 believes that he
was involved in the death

312
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,933
of Vice Admiral Fujisaki
last year

313
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,133
but there's no proof.

314
00:14:42,176 --> 00:14:43,269
The proof is buried

315
00:14:43,311 --> 00:14:45,543
somewhere in Koval's
personal database

316
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,382
which puts it
out of our reach for now.

317
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,617
But believe me, Doctor,
the Deputy Chief

318
00:14:49,658 --> 00:14:50,887
of Starfleet Intelligence

319
00:14:50,927 --> 00:14:53,193
doesn't just die
of food poisoning.

320
00:14:53,231 --> 00:14:55,326
I have to give him credit,
though.

321
00:14:55,368 --> 00:14:57,065
It was a textbook operation.

322
00:14:57,106 --> 00:14:58,973
No sign of foul play

323
00:14:59,076 --> 00:15:02,014
and certainly no sign
of Romulan involvement.

324
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:03,746
It was very tidy.

325
00:15:03,786 --> 00:15:05,915
Koval's political status?

326
00:15:05,957 --> 00:15:07,323
Ambiguous.

327
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:09,556
He hasn't been elevated
to the Continuing Committee

328
00:15:09,598 --> 00:15:12,126
which is usually a given
for the head of the Tal Shiar.

329
00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:13,660
His nomination has
probably been held up

330
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:16,176
because of his opposition
to the Federation alliance

331
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,303
which is supported

332
00:15:17,346 --> 00:15:18,814
by the majority
on the Committee.

333
00:15:18,849 --> 00:15:22,185
Which, in turn, opens the door
for your friend, Senator Cretak.

334
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:25,353
She's an advocate
of the alliance

335
00:15:25,395 --> 00:15:27,797
and she's been lobbying
for this open seat.

336
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:30,100
There is another rumor
about Koval

337
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,974
which is not contained
in his file.

338
00:15:33,011 --> 00:15:37,452
We've heard he's ill...
something called Tuvan Syndrome.

339
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:38,750
I'm familiar with it.

340
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:39,882
It's a neurological disease

341
00:15:39,925 --> 00:15:42,863
which affects mainly Vulcans,
Romulans and Rigelians.

342
00:15:42,897 --> 00:15:44,992
It's degenerative,
and incurable at present.

343
00:15:45,035 --> 00:15:47,802
If Koval is ill,
he'll try to hide it.

344
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:50,608
It's a weakness, and
one that could hamper

345
00:15:50,646 --> 00:15:52,946
his chances of being
appointed to the Committee.

346
00:15:52,984 --> 00:15:56,549
Is that what I'm here for?
A diagnosis?

347
00:15:56,592 --> 00:15:57,924
What's the matter, Sloan?

348
00:15:57,961 --> 00:16:00,022
Doesn't Section 31
have its own doctors?

349
00:16:00,131 --> 00:16:02,932
Our physicians weren't
genetically enhanced.

350
00:16:02,971 --> 00:16:04,964
They need equipment
to make a diagnosis...

351
00:16:05,008 --> 00:16:08,174
equipment that the Romulans
won't permit at this conference.

352
00:16:08,214 --> 00:16:10,184
I'm incapable
of making a diagnosis

353
00:16:10,218 --> 00:16:11,778
by simply looking at a man.

354
00:16:11,822 --> 00:16:14,350
Oh, your genetically-
enhanced friends

355
00:16:14,393 --> 00:16:17,263
determined that Gul Damar
killed a woman

356
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:19,998
just by watching him
give a political speech.

357
00:16:20,071 --> 00:16:23,009
I'm sure you can do
better than that.

358
00:16:24,981 --> 00:16:27,281
You're going to make a move
against Koval, aren't you?

359
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,120
You're going to find
a way to use his illness

360
00:16:30,158 --> 00:16:31,787
to keep him off the Committee.

361
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:34,025
I suppose it would be
naive of me to point out

362
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:35,968
that interfering
in the internal affairs

363
00:16:36,003 --> 00:16:37,130
of a sovereign power

364
00:16:37,172 --> 00:16:39,652
is explicitly forbidden
by the Federation Charter.

365
00:16:39,786 --> 00:16:43,453
Without confirming or denying
your speculation

366
00:16:43,493 --> 00:16:46,556
I will say
that if Koval comes to power

367
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,763
it'd be a disaster
for the Federation.

368
00:16:48,804 --> 00:16:51,901
He'll argue for the Romulans
to abrogate the alliance

369
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:54,107
and negotiate a separate peace
with the Dominion

370
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:55,582
and I don't think
I need to tell you

371
00:16:55,618 --> 00:16:57,713
what that would do
to the course of the war.

372
00:16:57,756 --> 00:16:59,190
You can't justify that
by manipulating...

373
00:16:59,225 --> 00:17:01,320
Let's make a deal, Doctor...

374
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:04,868
I'll spare you the ends-
justify-the-means speech

375
00:17:04,903 --> 00:17:06,166
and you spare me

376
00:17:06,205 --> 00:17:08,232
the we-must-do-
what's-right speech.

377
00:17:08,276 --> 00:17:11,248
You and I are not going to see
eye to eye on this subject

378
00:17:11,282 --> 00:17:13,149
so I suggest
we stop discussing it.

379
00:17:13,186 --> 00:17:16,158
This mission is reconnaissance.

380
00:17:16,192 --> 00:17:17,786
We are not going
to be called upon

381
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,560
to do anything other than that.

382
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,069
Now, why don't you
get some rest?

383
00:17:22,104 --> 00:17:24,667
We'll be in orbit
of Romulus by 0600

384
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:27,043
and you will need to have
your wits about you.

385
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,059
Here you are, sir.

386
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,544
Dr. Julian Bashir?

387
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:02,210
Yes.

388
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:03,583
I understand
you were the officer

389
00:18:03,621 --> 00:18:05,250
who first identified
the biogenic weapon

390
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,383
known as the Quickening.

391
00:18:06,492 --> 00:18:07,585
That's right...

392
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,565
on Boranis III,
in the Gamma Quadrant.

393
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:11,398
I don't believe
we've been introduced.

394
00:18:11,435 --> 00:18:13,405
Koval.

395
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:14,771
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

396
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:15,902
Why?

397
00:18:16,914 --> 00:18:18,314
Well, you've got me there.

398
00:18:18,349 --> 00:18:21,116
It's just a simple
form of expression, I suppose.

399
00:18:21,155 --> 00:18:22,555
And like most human expressions

400
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,424
completely devoid of meaning.

401
00:18:24,461 --> 00:18:27,433
Can the Dominion's Quickening
virus be replicated?

402
00:18:27,501 --> 00:18:30,200
We've had a little difficulty
in, uh, recreating

403
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,039
the exact RNA sequence
of the virus

404
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,570
which is why we've been
unable to develop a vaccine.

405
00:18:34,616 --> 00:18:36,609
However, there are alternate
methods of making vaccines...

406
00:18:36,653 --> 00:18:38,850
I'm not interested
in the vaccine.

407
00:18:38,891 --> 00:18:40,656
I'm interested in the virus.

408
00:18:40,695 --> 00:18:42,027
Do you know how to introduce

409
00:18:42,064 --> 00:18:43,693
the Quickening
into a population?

410
00:18:44,903 --> 00:18:46,030
Basically.

411
00:18:46,072 --> 00:18:47,165
Good.

412
00:18:47,207 --> 00:18:49,074
I look forward
to hearing your lecture.

413
00:18:55,457 --> 00:18:58,190
You're going to make
a very fine operative, Doctor.

414
00:18:58,229 --> 00:18:59,492
I beg your pardon?

415
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:00,964
The Chairman of the Tal Shiar

416
00:19:01,002 --> 00:19:02,767
rarely speaks
with anyone in public...

417
00:19:02,805 --> 00:19:05,241
much less someone
wearing that uniform.

418
00:19:05,276 --> 00:19:08,112
Starfleet Intelligence
should recruit you immediately.

419
00:19:08,149 --> 00:19:10,346
What makes you think I'm not
working for them already?

420
00:19:10,387 --> 00:19:14,020
Somehow, it wouldn't surprise me
if half the people in this room

421
00:19:14,061 --> 00:19:15,758
turned out to be operatives.

422
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:17,061
You are joking.

423
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,570
It may be impolitic to say this

424
00:19:19,605 --> 00:19:23,340
but there are those who believe
the alliance is merely a...

425
00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:25,144
momentary truce.

426
00:19:25,183 --> 00:19:26,617
And are you one of them?

427
00:19:26,652 --> 00:19:28,315
Well, I could ask you
the same thing.

428
00:19:28,356 --> 00:19:30,292
Well, in my case,
it's a firm "no"

429
00:19:30,326 --> 00:19:31,487
but you've answered
my question...

430
00:19:31,595 --> 00:19:32,756
with a question.

431
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,292
I try not to predict
the future.

432
00:19:35,336 --> 00:19:37,363
What about Chairman Koval?

433
00:19:37,407 --> 00:19:38,397
You tell me.

434
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:39,433
You just spoke with him.

435
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,505
That's more than I've
done in six months.

436
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:43,314
I take it you two
don't get along.

437
00:19:43,352 --> 00:19:45,083
We have different views.

438
00:19:45,123 --> 00:19:46,455
Which are?

439
00:19:48,931 --> 00:19:50,525
State secrets.

440
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:52,093
Naturally.

441
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:57,104
This is an adult female
inhabitant of Boranis III.

442
00:19:57,147 --> 00:20:00,347
The markings on the face
are typical of a humanoid

443
00:20:00,386 --> 00:20:02,015
who's been infected
by the disease

444
00:20:02,057 --> 00:20:05,427
but who has not yet entered
the terminal stage.

445
00:20:05,463 --> 00:20:07,456
In this next photograph

446
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:10,496
you can tell by the necrotic
nature of the lesions

447
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,874
that the patient has, indeed,
entered the terminal stage

448
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:14,039
of the disease.

449
00:20:14,081 --> 00:20:15,310
This is also marked

450
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,913
by an increase
in leukocyte production.

451
00:20:17,955 --> 00:20:19,515
Thank you, Doctor.

452
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:21,026
Excellent.

453
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:22,029
Thank you.

454
00:20:22,063 --> 00:20:23,156
Very enlightening.

455
00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:24,964
You almost made it
comprehensible.

456
00:20:25,003 --> 00:20:27,098
Next time, I'll do the lecture
with hand puppets just for you.

457
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,267
Thank you very much.

458
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:30,438
I'm glad to see you still
have your sense of humor.

459
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,611
I trust you noticed who was
sitting in the front row.

460
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:36,987
Yes. He came to see me this
morning between sessions.

461
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,624
He wanted to know more
about the Quickening...

462
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,861
specifically, if I knew
how to replicate the virus

463
00:20:41,903 --> 00:20:43,873
and how to introduce it
into a population.

464
00:20:43,907 --> 00:20:45,809
What did you think
of his health?

465
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,210
Didn't you hear
what I just said?

466
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:49,846
I heard you.

467
00:20:49,886 --> 00:20:52,186
Koval wants to get his
hands on the Quickening.

468
00:20:52,224 --> 00:20:53,955
That's not news to me...

469
00:20:53,994 --> 00:20:55,428
that the head of the Tal Shiar

470
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,296
is interested
in biogenic weapons.

471
00:20:57,334 --> 00:21:00,397
Pull your head out of the sand
and take a look around, Doctor.

472
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,808
These are not nice people
we're dealing with here.

473
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,712
Now answer my question.

474
00:21:04,748 --> 00:21:07,481
His eyelids were
slightly displaced.

475
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,615
He had a noticeable weakness
in the facial muscles...

476
00:21:09,658 --> 00:21:10,626
probably the result

477
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,789
of a compromised
neuromuscular function...

478
00:21:12,832 --> 00:21:15,268
and his respiration
was somewhat irregular.

479
00:21:15,303 --> 00:21:16,966
Bottom line.

480
00:21:17,007 --> 00:21:18,636
He may have Tuvan Syndrome.

481
00:21:18,743 --> 00:21:21,738
But if he does,
it's in the very early stages.

482
00:21:23,452 --> 00:21:25,445
How long does he have?

483
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:28,519
If his case fits the profile

484
00:21:28,562 --> 00:21:32,023
he will start experiencing
a loss of motor skills

485
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,801
in ten to 15 years...

486
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,279
with a life expectancy
in the 20 to 25-year range.

487
00:21:37,314 --> 00:21:39,945
Are there instances
in which the disease

488
00:21:39,986 --> 00:21:41,888
accelerates without warning?

489
00:21:41,923 --> 00:21:45,123
It happens, but in less than
five percent of the cases.

490
00:21:45,163 --> 00:21:48,499
Is there anything that could
trigger the acceleration?

491
00:21:48,536 --> 00:21:52,670
You know... I don't know
what you're asking me.

492
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,704
Never mind.

493
00:21:54,748 --> 00:21:56,148
Thank you, Doctor.

494
00:21:56,185 --> 00:21:58,052
You've been very helpful.

495
00:22:02,932 --> 00:22:04,230
This is unbelievable.

496
00:22:04,267 --> 00:22:05,599
Let's put aside for the moment

497
00:22:05,636 --> 00:22:07,070
that he's contemplating
the murder

498
00:22:07,107 --> 00:22:08,405
of a high-ranking official.

499
00:22:08,442 --> 00:22:10,241
What in the hell makes him think

500
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:11,679
that the next head
of the Tal Shiar

501
00:22:11,782 --> 00:22:13,411
would be any better than Koval?

502
00:22:13,452 --> 00:22:15,081
Well, Sloan's more
concerned with who gets

503
00:22:15,123 --> 00:22:17,116
the empty seat on the
Continuing Committee.

504
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,686
He's hoping
that Cretak gets that.

505
00:22:18,763 --> 00:22:20,630
Well, I sort of agree
with him there.

506
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,363
Cretak, for all her abrasiveness

507
00:22:22,404 --> 00:22:23,702
is at least a patriot.

508
00:22:23,739 --> 00:22:25,470
What makes her any different
from Koval?

509
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,707
If you saw the reports
from Starfleet Intelligence

510
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:29,875
that I see, you would
never ask that question.

511
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,684
Koval would like nothing better

512
00:22:31,722 --> 00:22:34,421
than to see the Romulan
banner waving over Earth.

513
00:22:34,461 --> 00:22:38,231
Believe me, Doctor,
Chairman Koval is not someone

514
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:40,466
we want to see
at the Praetor's right hand.

515
00:22:40,506 --> 00:22:43,478
I'll have Sloan confined
to his quarters immediately

516
00:22:43,512 --> 00:22:45,106
but that may not
solve our problem.

517
00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:46,276
Sir?

518
00:22:48,255 --> 00:22:49,553
Has it occurred to you

519
00:22:49,591 --> 00:22:51,754
that you and Sloan may not
be the only ones here

520
00:22:51,795 --> 00:22:54,027
working for Section 31?

521
00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:56,196
For all we know,
he has a confederate

522
00:22:56,238 --> 00:22:57,935
somewhere in the delegation.

523
00:22:57,975 --> 00:22:59,409
Sloan did say that our mission

524
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:01,141
would be strictly
reconnaissance...

525
00:23:01,181 --> 00:23:03,117
that we wouldn't be called
upon to do anything else.

526
00:23:03,152 --> 00:23:04,712
That could suggest
another operative...

527
00:23:04,821 --> 00:23:07,349
someone whose mission isn't
limited to reconnaissance.

528
00:23:07,393 --> 00:23:09,158
If that's true,
it could be anyone...

529
00:23:09,197 --> 00:23:11,463
even a member of
the <i>Bellerophon</i> crew.

530
00:23:11,502 --> 00:23:13,404
Or a Romulan.

531
00:23:13,439 --> 00:23:14,407
What?

532
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:17,641
Sir, I believe Sloan
has an accomplice

533
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,912
here... on Romulus.

534
00:23:19,952 --> 00:23:21,250
What makes you say that?

535
00:23:21,288 --> 00:23:22,256
Two things.

536
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:25,524
First, Sloan has
too much information

537
00:23:25,563 --> 00:23:27,692
on the inner workings
of their government...

538
00:23:27,734 --> 00:23:30,399
too many insights into
their political process.

539
00:23:30,439 --> 00:23:33,673
Second,
Sloan's plan is to kill Koval

540
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:34,680
while making it appear to be

541
00:23:34,714 --> 00:23:36,479
an accelerated case
of Tuvan Syndrome.

542
00:23:36,518 --> 00:23:38,545
Now, the only way to do that
would be to expose Koval

543
00:23:38,589 --> 00:23:41,186
to a short burst
of nadion radiation.

544
00:23:41,228 --> 00:23:44,462
The simplest plan would be to
maneuver him near a phaser relay

545
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:46,801
and surreptitiously
irradiate him.

546
00:23:46,872 --> 00:23:48,967
Now, since I doubt very much

547
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,037
that Sloan is going to have
the chance to do that

548
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:54,076
it stands to reason someone else
is going to have to.

549
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,315
A Romulan?

550
00:23:55,356 --> 00:23:56,483
Exactly.

551
00:23:56,525 --> 00:24:00,192
Sir, Sloan may have already
gotten things underway.

552
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:01,427
We have to warn them.

553
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:05,499
And how am I supposed to explain
Section 31 to the Romulans?

554
00:24:05,543 --> 00:24:07,376
All hell would break loose
if they hear

555
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:09,610
that there's a rogue
Federation agency running around

556
00:24:09,651 --> 00:24:11,119
plotting assassinations.

557
00:24:11,154 --> 00:24:13,420
It could bring
the alliance down.

558
00:24:13,459 --> 00:24:15,929
Besides, all we have
is speculation

559
00:24:15,964 --> 00:24:17,455
- at this point.
- Admiral...

560
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,798
The answer is no.

561
00:24:18,836 --> 00:24:22,206
After I have Sloan arrested,
I'll break radio silence

562
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:24,475
and inform Starfleet Command
of the situation.

563
00:24:24,514 --> 00:24:25,812
Your orders are to sit tight

564
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:27,783
and do nothing
until you hear from me.

565
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,311
Aye, sir.

566
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:49,419
I don't know.

567
00:24:49,464 --> 00:24:51,593
Jepella said she went
in to deliver a report

568
00:24:51,635 --> 00:24:53,628
and found him slumped
over his desk.

569
00:24:53,672 --> 00:24:55,335
Do they have any idea
what happened?

570
00:24:55,376 --> 00:24:57,107
Dr. Frame said it looked
like an aneurysm

571
00:24:57,146 --> 00:24:58,307
but they're still running tests.

572
00:24:58,348 --> 00:24:59,316
An aneurysm.

573
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,375
I saw the Admiral this morning.

574
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:01,387
He looked fine.

575
00:25:01,421 --> 00:25:02,582
They say that's
the way it happens.

576
00:25:02,623 --> 00:25:03,989
Which Admiral are
you talking about?

577
00:25:04,027 --> 00:25:06,020
Uh, Admiral Ross, sir.

578
00:25:06,064 --> 00:25:07,327
He collapsed at his desk.

579
00:25:07,366 --> 00:25:08,356
Where is he?

580
00:25:08,402 --> 00:25:09,597
Sick Bay.

581
00:25:15,316 --> 00:25:17,081
Hey.

582
00:25:42,537 --> 00:25:44,598
I can't trust anybody
aboard the <i>Bellerophon.</i>

583
00:25:44,641 --> 00:25:46,611
And I can't contact DS9.

584
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:49,583
For security reasons, there's
been a communications blackout.

585
00:25:49,617 --> 00:25:52,145
Senator, I have no one
else to turn to.

586
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,385
I need your help.

587
00:25:53,425 --> 00:25:54,688
To do what?

588
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:56,287
I have reason to believe

589
00:25:56,331 --> 00:25:59,531
that Sloan has an accomplice
within the Romulan government.

590
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:02,007
Someone who's going to help him
carry out this assassination.

591
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:07,619
Koval has been saying
there's a traitor in the Senate.

592
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:10,055
Someone working for
Starfleet Intelligence.

593
00:26:10,092 --> 00:26:12,119
Section 31 isn't part
of Starfleet Intelligence.

594
00:26:12,163 --> 00:26:14,156
They are Federation
citizens working

595
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,691
to advance your interests.

596
00:26:15,736 --> 00:26:17,899
That makes them
your responsibility.

597
00:26:18,007 --> 00:26:19,601
You're absolutely right.

598
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:21,807
That's why I'm doing everything
I can to stop them.

599
00:26:21,848 --> 00:26:23,248
I'm trying to convince Sloan

600
00:26:23,285 --> 00:26:25,380
that Koval doesn't
have Tuvan Syndrome

601
00:26:25,422 --> 00:26:27,915
but he may have already asked
his accomplice to proceed.

602
00:26:28,027 --> 00:26:30,190
So if we want to be sure
to stop this assassination

603
00:26:30,232 --> 00:26:32,035
we have to find Sloan's
Romulan accomplice.

604
00:26:32,168 --> 00:26:34,001
And you expect me
to find this traitor.

605
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:37,067
Sloan said something about Koval
having a personal database.

606
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:38,137
It stands to reason

607
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,777
that it contains a list
of potential suspects.

608
00:26:40,818 --> 00:26:42,150
Now, is there any possible way

609
00:26:42,188 --> 00:26:43,885
you can get me
a copy of this database

610
00:26:43,924 --> 00:26:45,791
so that I can run
an analysis of...

611
00:26:45,828 --> 00:26:48,493
You are asking me to hand
over secret documents.

612
00:26:48,534 --> 00:26:49,968
I'm asking you to put aside

613
00:26:50,003 --> 00:26:52,166
three centuries of mistrust
between our peoples

614
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:53,871
and help me stop a murder.

615
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:56,906
Senator, if we can't reach out

616
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,579
and bridge the gulf
that is between us

617
00:26:58,621 --> 00:27:02,025
if we can't trust each other,
a man will die

618
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,496
and we will be
partially responsible.

619
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:07,300
I need your help.

620
00:27:07,405 --> 00:27:09,136
Please.

621
00:27:17,392 --> 00:27:18,826
You wanted to see me, Doctor?

622
00:27:18,861 --> 00:27:20,159
Yes.

623
00:27:20,198 --> 00:27:23,329
I'm not convinced that Koval is
suffering from Tuvan Syndrome.

624
00:27:23,437 --> 00:27:24,700
His symptoms could be the result

625
00:27:24,739 --> 00:27:26,606
of any number of different
health problems.

626
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,546
You didn't say that before.

627
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:32,019
Well, I'm not an expert
on Romulan physiology.

628
00:27:32,054 --> 00:27:34,047
Most of my knowledge
on Tuvan Syndrome

629
00:27:34,091 --> 00:27:36,288
comes from studies
done on Vulcan patients.

630
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,298
I thought Vulcans

631
00:27:37,332 --> 00:27:40,600
and Romulans
were virtually identical.

632
00:27:40,638 --> 00:27:42,129
Yes, but there are

633
00:27:42,175 --> 00:27:44,236
some important
genetic differences.

634
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:45,747
And the more I study

635
00:27:45,781 --> 00:27:47,774
the available data
on Romulan physiology

636
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:50,255
the less sure I am that
my diagnosis was correct.

637
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:51,988
How could you find out
for sure?

638
00:27:52,027 --> 00:27:53,929
The best way would be
to do an examination

639
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,831
but I hardly think
he'll agree to that.

640
00:27:55,868 --> 00:27:59,068
What if you obtained
a sample of his skin cells?

641
00:27:59,108 --> 00:28:01,078
Could you run an analysis?

642
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:02,775
Probably.

643
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:04,478
But how do you propose...

644
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:08,357
We'll treat your palm
with a microcellular adhesive.

645
00:28:08,394 --> 00:28:10,159
The next time
you shake his hand

646
00:28:10,197 --> 00:28:11,996
you'll get your sample.

647
00:28:14,472 --> 00:28:15,735
All right.

648
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:36,772
Mr. Chairman.

649
00:28:36,817 --> 00:28:38,980
What a pleasure
to see you again.

650
00:28:41,893 --> 00:28:44,363
I'd be very happy to resume
our discussion on the Quickening

651
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,890
before this conference
is adjourned.

652
00:28:45,935 --> 00:28:48,269
I believe you answered
all my questions, Doctor.

653
00:28:48,307 --> 00:28:51,211
Well, I'm glad
to have been able to help.

654
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:53,375
Doctor, I would like to have

655
00:28:53,417 --> 00:28:56,082
a word with you
on another matter.

656
00:28:56,122 --> 00:28:57,090
In private.

657
00:28:57,124 --> 00:28:58,251
Of course.

658
00:28:58,293 --> 00:29:00,024
I believe
the Lecture Hall's empty.

659
00:29:00,063 --> 00:29:01,395
We have other, more comfortable

660
00:29:01,466 --> 00:29:03,163
facilities available,
if you please.

661
00:29:10,484 --> 00:29:11,577
Sit down.

662
00:29:16,863 --> 00:29:19,426
I can assure you that you
will be sitting in that chair

663
00:29:19,502 --> 00:29:21,301
one way or the other, Doctor.

664
00:29:34,365 --> 00:29:37,964
Now we'll have our private talk.

665
00:29:38,005 --> 00:29:39,838
What shall we talk about?

666
00:29:39,876 --> 00:29:41,778
Why you're really on Romulus.

667
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,476
Who you're working for,
and, of course

668
00:29:43,584 --> 00:29:44,916
who's helping you.

669
00:29:44,953 --> 00:29:46,114
Don't worry...

670
00:29:46,155 --> 00:29:48,683
I won't waste your time
with pointless questions.

671
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:01,643
This can be painful or not.

672
00:30:01,686 --> 00:30:03,154
That's up to you, Doctor.

673
00:30:03,189 --> 00:30:06,525
Either way, I will know
what you know.

674
00:30:24,832 --> 00:30:27,200
It appears that your brain's
neurocellular structure

675
00:30:27,237 --> 00:30:29,571
is not susceptible
to our scanning techniques.

676
00:30:29,676 --> 00:30:31,669
Evidently a result
of the genetic enhancements

677
00:30:31,713 --> 00:30:33,580
made to your parietal cortex.

678
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:34,811
Sorry.

679
00:30:34,852 --> 00:30:37,084
I do have other methods
at my disposal

680
00:30:37,123 --> 00:30:39,993
but it would save everyone
a great deal of trouble

681
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:42,192
if you would simply tell
me what I want to know.

682
00:30:42,233 --> 00:30:44,601
You haven't asked me
any questions yet.

683
00:30:44,639 --> 00:30:46,871
I think you know what
I'm interested in.

684
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,607
Who are you working for?

685
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,547
Why are you here?

686
00:30:53,155 --> 00:30:54,145
Bring him.

687
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:04,940
Dr. Julian Bashir.

688
00:31:04,979 --> 00:31:07,279
You are appearing before
the Continuing Committee

689
00:31:07,317 --> 00:31:09,549
of the Romulan people.

690
00:31:09,589 --> 00:31:12,322
Any statements will be made
part of the official record.

691
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,923
Senator Cretak
is charged with attempting

692
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:19,168
to access a Tal Shiar database
without proper authorization.

693
00:31:19,207 --> 00:31:24,240
The Senator has told the
Committee a remarkable story.

694
00:31:24,284 --> 00:31:27,279
Since you are a key figure
in her story

695
00:31:27,323 --> 00:31:30,489
we are most eager to hear
your version of events.

696
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:40,014
What I am about to say
may be shocking.

697
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:42,281
It may even damage the relations

698
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,654
between our two peoples

699
00:31:44,692 --> 00:31:46,126
but it's the truth.

700
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:51,235
A few days ago,
I became aware of a plot

701
00:31:51,271 --> 00:31:53,264
to assassinate Chairman Koval.

702
00:31:53,309 --> 00:31:56,110
It was conceived of
by a man known to me

703
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:57,811
only as "Sloan."

704
00:31:57,852 --> 00:32:02,020
He works for an organization
called Section 31.

705
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,795
They see themselves
as protecting the interests

706
00:32:05,834 --> 00:32:07,029
of the Federation

707
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:11,568
although they have absolutely
no official standing.

708
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:16,580
Once I realized what Sloan
was attempting to do

709
00:32:16,623 --> 00:32:19,652
I contacted Senator Cretak

710
00:32:19,695 --> 00:32:22,895
in order to enlist her aid
in stopping him.

711
00:32:22,935 --> 00:32:24,461
Why her?

712
00:32:24,505 --> 00:32:26,839
I had no one else to turn to.

713
00:32:26,876 --> 00:32:29,609
I was unable to contact
Deep Space 9

714
00:32:29,649 --> 00:32:32,815
and I couldn't trust anybody
aboard the <i>Bellerophon.</i>

715
00:32:32,855 --> 00:32:35,884
But you felt that you could
trust a Romulan Senator?

716
00:32:35,928 --> 00:32:37,362
Yes.

717
00:32:37,397 --> 00:32:39,697
For all our differences

718
00:32:39,735 --> 00:32:40,828
I do respect her.

719
00:32:43,777 --> 00:32:45,040
Continue.

720
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:47,676
For reasons that are
extremely complicated

721
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:48,947
I came to believe

722
00:32:48,987 --> 00:32:50,581
that there's a traitor
in your government

723
00:32:50,624 --> 00:32:51,592
working for Section 31.

724
00:32:51,626 --> 00:32:54,427
I asked the Senator
to obtain the database

725
00:32:54,464 --> 00:32:56,730
so that we could
expose this person

726
00:32:56,803 --> 00:32:58,739
and prevent the assassination.

727
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,040
Senator Cretak,
why didn't you come to me

728
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,777
with this information?

729
00:33:03,817 --> 00:33:07,780
I was afraid that if word
of this... plot... got out

730
00:33:07,825 --> 00:33:09,954
it would destroy the alliance.

731
00:33:09,996 --> 00:33:12,159
I decided to keep
my own counsel.

732
00:33:14,304 --> 00:33:16,297
I regret that decision.

733
00:33:16,341 --> 00:33:18,709
As well you should, Kimara.

734
00:33:18,813 --> 00:33:21,546
It's an interesting story

735
00:33:21,586 --> 00:33:23,488
but it's not the whole story.

736
00:33:23,523 --> 00:33:26,086
If I may be permitted
to bring in another witness?

737
00:33:28,934 --> 00:33:30,597
Bring in prisoner 527.

738
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:37,844
Praetor

739
00:33:37,885 --> 00:33:40,378
this is the man
known as "Sloan."

740
00:33:40,423 --> 00:33:42,325
Unlike the Doctor, his mind is

741
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,923
quite susceptible
to our data-retrieval methods.

742
00:33:44,966 --> 00:33:46,332
Under questioning,
he has confirmed

743
00:33:46,368 --> 00:33:48,634
much of what the Doctor
and the Senator have told you

744
00:33:48,673 --> 00:33:50,734
with one
important exception...

745
00:33:50,777 --> 00:33:52,940
there is no Section 31.

746
00:33:52,982 --> 00:33:55,783
Sloan, in fact, works
for Starfleet Intelligence.

747
00:33:55,821 --> 00:33:59,316
Far from being the master
of a rogue agency

748
00:33:59,361 --> 00:34:01,194
he is simply one
of many operatives

749
00:34:01,231 --> 00:34:02,894
in the employ
of the Federation.

750
00:34:02,935 --> 00:34:04,996
He's had a long career.

751
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,168
Most of which
is still unknown to us.

752
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:09,578
However, there is one
interesting element

753
00:34:09,615 --> 00:34:11,915
that we do know...
he was the protégé

754
00:34:11,953 --> 00:34:14,150
of the late
Vice Admiral Fujisaki.

755
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:17,321
Sloan did not take
the death of his mentor well.

756
00:34:17,363 --> 00:34:18,353
He came to believe

757
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,266
he was murdered
by the Tal Shiar.

758
00:34:20,302 --> 00:34:22,499
In his eyes, the assassination

759
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:26,207
of a Starfleet Admiral was
"stepping over the line."

760
00:34:26,248 --> 00:34:28,241
Isn't that the phrase?

761
00:34:28,285 --> 00:34:32,692
After Fujisaki's death, he
was confronted with a dilemma.

762
00:34:32,728 --> 00:34:34,789
How could he seek vengeance

763
00:34:34,832 --> 00:34:37,064
without violating
the Federation's laws?

764
00:34:37,103 --> 00:34:39,700
His answer was
to invent Section 31...

765
00:34:39,742 --> 00:34:42,805
a rogue organization
that answered to no one.

766
00:34:42,848 --> 00:34:44,316
If they killed the head

767
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,149
of the Tal Shiar,
Starfleet Intelligence

768
00:34:46,188 --> 00:34:47,714
would be held blameless.

769
00:34:47,758 --> 00:34:50,321
As the Committee knows

770
00:34:50,362 --> 00:34:52,832
I have been diagnosed
with Tuvan Syndrome.

771
00:34:52,935 --> 00:34:54,666
Sloan became aware
of my condition

772
00:34:54,705 --> 00:34:56,071
and hoped to make my death

773
00:34:56,108 --> 00:34:58,135
look like a sudden
acceleration of the disease.

774
00:34:58,178 --> 00:35:01,014
To do that,
he needed a doctor.

775
00:35:01,051 --> 00:35:05,355
Sloan arranged to recruit
Dr. Bashir into Section 31.

776
00:35:05,392 --> 00:35:08,626
After that, Sloan
bided his time

777
00:35:08,666 --> 00:35:11,136
and waited for an opportunity
to present itself.

778
00:35:11,171 --> 00:35:13,664
He found one when he learned
of this conference.

779
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:17,080
He then arranged
for Bashir to be invited.

780
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:18,813
Everything was going perfectly

781
00:35:18,887 --> 00:35:22,348
but then he made
a fatal mistake.

782
00:35:22,393 --> 00:35:25,490
He decided to come
to Romulus himself.

783
00:35:25,533 --> 00:35:28,630
He was unaware that his identity
had become known to us.

784
00:35:28,673 --> 00:35:30,609
Once we recognized him
in the delegation

785
00:35:30,644 --> 00:35:31,942
we knew immediately

786
00:35:31,979 --> 00:35:33,642
that an intelligence
operation was underway.

787
00:35:33,683 --> 00:35:37,623
What I don't understand
is... why.

788
00:35:37,658 --> 00:35:40,596
Why did you come here and take
the risk of being discovered?

789
00:35:42,366 --> 00:35:45,600
I had to make sure
nothing went wrong

790
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:49,602
and I wanted to watch you die...

791
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:53,252
You broke the cardinal
rule of our profession.

792
00:35:53,288 --> 00:35:55,816
You allowed business
to become personal.

793
00:35:57,563 --> 00:35:59,897
So there was
an assassination plan?

794
00:35:59,935 --> 00:36:01,837
Most definitely.

795
00:36:01,939 --> 00:36:04,672
As to the involvement
of the Doctor and the Senator

796
00:36:04,712 --> 00:36:07,182
Dr. Bashir may have
intended to kill me

797
00:36:07,216 --> 00:36:08,650
or he may have
intended to save me.

798
00:36:08,686 --> 00:36:10,622
There is no way
to know for certain.

799
00:36:10,656 --> 00:36:12,455
As for Senator Cretak

800
00:36:12,493 --> 00:36:15,056
we all know
she's an ambitious woman.

801
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:16,362
It is entirely possible,
she would

802
00:36:16,401 --> 00:36:18,098
welcome my death,
especially if it meant

803
00:36:18,138 --> 00:36:20,108
her being elevated
to the Continuing Committee

804
00:36:20,142 --> 00:36:21,474
in my place.

805
00:36:21,511 --> 00:36:23,413
That is a lie, Koval.

806
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:25,247
I was trying to save your life.

807
00:36:25,286 --> 00:36:27,381
Well, then,
you're simply a fool.

808
00:36:27,423 --> 00:36:30,156
You let a Starfleet Intelligence
officer manipulate you

809
00:36:30,195 --> 00:36:32,290
into committing
an act of treason.

810
00:36:39,495 --> 00:36:40,656
It is the finding

811
00:36:40,697 --> 00:36:45,435
of this Committee that
Senator Cretak has conspired

812
00:36:45,473 --> 00:36:47,136
to commit treason
against the state.

813
00:36:47,177 --> 00:36:49,647
Sentence to be determined
at a later date.

814
00:36:50,785 --> 00:36:53,416
Dr. Bashir will be returned
to the <i>Bellerophon.</i>

815
00:36:53,456 --> 00:36:54,515
Mr. Sloan...

816
00:36:54,558 --> 00:36:58,293
is remanded to the custody
of the Tal Shiar

817
00:36:58,332 --> 00:36:59,995
for further interrogation.

818
00:37:00,036 --> 00:37:01,026
No!

819
00:37:30,096 --> 00:37:31,428
Come in.

820
00:37:33,436 --> 00:37:34,699
Admiral.

821
00:37:34,738 --> 00:37:36,206
Doctor.

822
00:37:37,477 --> 00:37:39,879
Feeling, uh, better, sir?

823
00:37:39,916 --> 00:37:40,906
Much.

824
00:37:40,951 --> 00:37:43,582
Dr. Frame tells me
that I should take it easy

825
00:37:43,656 --> 00:37:44,988
for a few days,
but, uh... paperwork

826
00:37:45,026 --> 00:37:46,517
waits for no man.

827
00:37:46,562 --> 00:37:47,860
What can I do for you?

828
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:49,265
I have a question.

829
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:50,861
Where's Sloan?

830
00:37:51,907 --> 00:37:53,398
Sloan's dead.

831
00:37:53,442 --> 00:37:57,610
Admiral... where's Sloan?

832
00:38:01,725 --> 00:38:03,786
If we're going to have
this discussion

833
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:05,629
then it's off the record.

834
00:38:11,345 --> 00:38:14,511
But before I answer your
question, answer mine.

835
00:38:15,988 --> 00:38:17,548
How did you know?

836
00:38:17,591 --> 00:38:20,324
The man Koval described
was not the same man

837
00:38:20,363 --> 00:38:23,199
who recruited me
into Section 31.

838
00:38:23,235 --> 00:38:26,139
Anyone clever enough
to pull the wool

839
00:38:26,175 --> 00:38:28,077
so completely over my eyes

840
00:38:28,112 --> 00:38:30,709
wouldn't have been caught
by the Romulans so easily.

841
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,449
There had to be
another explanation.

842
00:38:33,489 --> 00:38:36,256
And then I remembered
that you were the one

843
00:38:36,295 --> 00:38:38,527
who planted the idea
in my head

844
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,094
that Sloan had an accomplice.

845
00:38:41,138 --> 00:38:43,837
You were the one who didn't
want to tell the Romulans

846
00:38:43,877 --> 00:38:45,744
that there was
an assassination plot.

847
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,650
You were the one
who issued the orders

848
00:38:48,753 --> 00:38:50,655
preventing me from contacting
Deep Space 9.

849
00:38:52,093 --> 00:38:55,588
And when the time
came to arrest Sloan

850
00:38:55,633 --> 00:39:02,409
you conveniently had an
aneurysm... leaving me alone

851
00:39:02,447 --> 00:39:06,444
with no one to turn to
for help, except Cretak

852
00:39:06,488 --> 00:39:09,119
and as I realized
your involvement

853
00:39:09,161 --> 00:39:12,327
the rest began
to fall into place.

854
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:14,030
Where is he?

855
00:39:16,141 --> 00:39:17,404
I don't know.

856
00:39:17,444 --> 00:39:20,575
But he's alive...
isn't he?

857
00:39:20,616 --> 00:39:23,179
He was supposed
to be beamed away

858
00:39:23,222 --> 00:39:25,454
a split second
before the phaser beam hit him.

859
00:39:25,493 --> 00:39:29,524
Whether it worked or not,
I couldn't say.

860
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:34,066
How long has Koval
been working for Starfleet?

861
00:39:34,111 --> 00:39:35,876
He's been providing
the Federation

862
00:39:35,914 --> 00:39:39,786
with critical military
intelligence for over a year.

863
00:39:39,821 --> 00:39:44,285
When he started working
with Section 31, I don't know.

864
00:39:44,331 --> 00:39:48,271
But in any case,
we have our mole...

865
00:39:48,305 --> 00:39:49,899
working for us

866
00:39:49,942 --> 00:39:52,709
at the top levels
of Romulan government.

867
00:39:52,814 --> 00:39:55,377
Good for us.

868
00:39:57,056 --> 00:40:01,292
And what about your friend,
Senator Cretak?

869
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:04,132
What's going to happen to her?

870
00:40:04,171 --> 00:40:06,607
Dismissed from the Senate...

871
00:40:06,642 --> 00:40:08,339
definitely.

872
00:40:08,379 --> 00:40:10,110
Imprisoned, most likely.

873
00:40:10,149 --> 00:40:12,119
Executed?

874
00:40:13,622 --> 00:40:14,988
I hope not.

875
00:40:15,026 --> 00:40:17,053
You set her up!

876
00:40:17,096 --> 00:40:20,330
She was an innocent woman
and you let Sloan destroy her.

877
00:40:20,369 --> 00:40:21,359
Why?

878
00:40:21,405 --> 00:40:24,275
She believed in the alliance.

879
00:40:26,014 --> 00:40:27,643
She was on our side.

880
00:40:28,919 --> 00:40:30,889
No, she wasn't.

881
00:40:30,923 --> 00:40:32,552
I told you before, Julian...

882
00:40:32,594 --> 00:40:33,789
she's a patriot

883
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:36,061
which means, if it serves
the interests of the Romulans

884
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:38,537
to negotiate a separate
peace with the Dominion

885
00:40:38,572 --> 00:40:40,667
Cretak would push that option

886
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,807
and believe me, the Dominion
would like nothing more

887
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:46,251
than to make a deal with
the Romulans right now.

888
00:40:46,288 --> 00:40:49,488
So Koval becomes your guarantee
that that does not happen

889
00:40:49,527 --> 00:40:50,825
and as a man
who was nearly killed

890
00:40:50,897 --> 00:40:52,263
for his anti-Federation
activities

891
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,826
his recommendation
to stay in the war

892
00:40:53,903 --> 00:40:55,098
becomes all
the more convincing.

893
00:40:55,139 --> 00:40:56,768
That's the general idea.

894
00:40:56,808 --> 00:41:00,076
And how long have you worked
for Section 31?

895
00:41:00,116 --> 00:41:01,084
I don't.

896
00:41:01,118 --> 00:41:03,520
Oh, just a temporary
alliance, is it?

897
00:41:03,555 --> 00:41:05,081
Something like that.

898
00:41:05,126 --> 00:41:08,257
You don't see anything wrong
with what happened, do you?

899
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:10,599
I don't like it

900
00:41:10,636 --> 00:41:12,799
but I've spent the last
year and a half of my life

901
00:41:12,874 --> 00:41:14,741
ordering young men and
young women to die.

902
00:41:14,778 --> 00:41:16,304
I like that even less.

903
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,215
That's a glib answer

904
00:41:18,252 --> 00:41:21,019
and a cheap way
to avoid the fact

905
00:41:21,058 --> 00:41:22,458
that you've trampled
on the very thing

906
00:41:22,493 --> 00:41:23,791
that those young men and women

907
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:25,263
are out there dying to protect!

908
00:41:25,299 --> 00:41:27,599
Does that not mean
anything to you?!

909
00:41:27,637 --> 00:41:30,609
<i>Inter arma enim silent leges.</i>

910
00:41:30,643 --> 00:41:33,706
"In time of war,
the law falls silent."

911
00:41:33,749 --> 00:41:35,343
Cicero.

912
00:41:35,386 --> 00:41:38,051
So is that what we have become...

913
00:41:38,092 --> 00:41:39,959
a 24th-century Rome

914
00:41:39,995 --> 00:41:42,261
driven by nothing other
than the certainty

915
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,736
that Caesar can do no wrong?!

916
00:41:46,908 --> 00:41:49,208
This conversation
never happened.

917
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:54,818
You're dismissed.

918
00:42:20,443 --> 00:42:21,843
Good evening.

919
00:42:23,048 --> 00:42:25,245
Are you expecting applause?

920
00:42:25,286 --> 00:42:27,985
Have you come to take a bow?

921
00:42:28,024 --> 00:42:31,121
I just wanted to say thank you.

922
00:42:31,164 --> 00:42:32,564
For what?

923
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,802
Allowing you to manipulate
me so completely?

924
00:42:37,877 --> 00:42:40,143
For being a decent human being.

925
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:43,713
That's why we selected you
in the first place, Doctor.

926
00:42:43,755 --> 00:42:47,159
We needed somebody
who wanted to play the game

927
00:42:47,196 --> 00:42:49,098
but who'd only go so far.

928
00:42:49,134 --> 00:42:52,197
When the time came,
you stood your ground.

929
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,800
You did the right thing.

930
00:42:53,842 --> 00:42:55,402
You reached out to an enemy.

931
00:42:55,446 --> 00:42:56,778
You told her the truth.

932
00:42:56,815 --> 00:42:58,842
You tried to stop a murder.

933
00:42:58,886 --> 00:43:01,551
The Federation needs
men like you, Doctor.

934
00:43:01,591 --> 00:43:03,891
Men of conscience.
Men of principle.

935
00:43:03,962 --> 00:43:06,228
Men who can sleep at night.

936
00:43:06,268 --> 00:43:10,504
You're also the reason
Section 31 exists.

937
00:43:10,543 --> 00:43:13,174
Someone has to protect
men like you

938
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:16,449
from a universe
that doesn't share your sense

939
00:43:16,488 --> 00:43:18,287
of right and wrong.

940
00:43:18,325 --> 00:43:20,454
Should I feel sorry for you?

941
00:43:20,496 --> 00:43:22,728
Should I be weeping

942
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,464
over the burden
you're forced to carry

943
00:43:24,504 --> 00:43:26,599
in order to protect
the rest of us?

944
00:43:30,683 --> 00:43:34,087
It is an honor
to know you, Doctor.

945
00:43:35,726 --> 00:43:37,024
Good night.

946
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,445
Bashir to Security.

947
00:43:48,485 --> 00:43:49,851
Odo here.

948
00:43:53,595 --> 00:43:55,029
Never mind.

949
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:58,001
My mistake.
