1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:03,671
By the way,
your<i> gagh</i> has arrived.

2
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:05,130
My what?

3
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:06,423
Oh, no.

4
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:08,008
Oh, yes, and it's
waiting for you

5
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,844
in Cargo Bay 2.

6
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:10,928
Your<i> gagh?</i>

7
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,888
Jadzia ordered it.

8
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,264
She was planning a party

9
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:15,724
for Martok's birthday
next week.

10
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,518
How much<i> gagh</i> did she order?

11
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,227
51 cases.

12
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,772
Each containing
a different variety.

13
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:23,398
There are varieties
of<i> gagh?</i>

14
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,068
Oh, yes. I can remember
what each one tastes like

15
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,364
and the way they feel
when you swallow them.

16
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,783
<i>Torgud gagh</i> wiggles.

17
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:34,869
<i>Filden gagh</i> squirms.

18
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,662
<i>Meshta gagh</i> jumps.

19
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,706
(<i> coughing</i> )

20
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,123
Are you all right?

21
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,751
Are<i> you</i> all right?

22
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,796
Me?

23
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,006
Well, you've barely
said three words.

24
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,173
Something on your mind?

25
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,717
Oh, no. I just, uh...

26
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,844
can't wait to see Miles,
that's all.

27
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,303
Oh, let me guess.

28
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:54,847
You have
a holosuite appointment--

29
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:56,724
defending the Alamo again?

30
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,893
You know me too well.

31
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,936
KIRA:
When does
his transport arrive?

32
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,103
Half an hour.

33
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:05,065
<i>Bithool gagh</i> has feet.

34
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,484
Flush it out the airlock,
all of it.

35
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:10,404
Environmental regulations.

36
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,406
Well, why don't you just
give it to Martok?

37
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:17,244
He'd insist on sharing it
with me as a point of honor.

38
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:22,666
<i>Wistan gagh</i> is packed
in<i> targ</i> blood.

39
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,793
I have to go now.

40
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,211
See you later.

41
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,505
I think I'd
better go, too.

42
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,760
Give my regards
to Santa Anna.

43
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,041
What?

44
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,667
Miles asked me
not to say anything,

45
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,294
but, uh, I haven't heard
from him in three days

46
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,129
and since he wasn't
on this morning's transport,

47
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,965
I think something might
have happened to him.

48
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,300
He told me he was going home
to visit his father.

49
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,844
He may have implied that he
was going to visit his father,

50
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,304
but he didn't actually say it.

51
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,889
Doctor, please.

52
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,724
Yes, sir.

53
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,142
So where is he?

54
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,894
The last message
I received from him

55
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,771
said that he was
still in New Sydney

56
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,648
and that he was following up
on some promising leads.

57
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,899
He's not a detective.

58
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:30,150
He's an engineer.

59
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,610
He is my Chief Engineer

60
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,528
and now he's missing.

61
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,032
So who is this woman he's
supposed to be looking for?

62
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:39,200
She's the widow
of Liam Bilby.

63
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,662
Bilby? Bilby?

64
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:45,124
The man he befriended in that
undercover operation last year?

65
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,835
Yes, sir. Miles still feels
responsible for his death

66
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,378
and has been in touch
with his widow ever since,

67
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,881
and when she dropped
out of sight three weeks ago

68
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,173
he got worried

69
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,801
and decided
to find her.

70
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,303
And now they're both
missing. Perfect.

71
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,972
In his defense, sir,

72
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,389
he did try and go through
the official channels,

73
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,933
but the authorities
on New Sydney

74
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:04,559
weren't very cooperative,
to say the least,

75
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,103
and since it isn't
a Federation world,

76
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:07,896
Starfleet doesn't have
any jurisdiction.

77
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,482
So he decided to turn
into a one-man police force.

78
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:11,650
Yes, sir.

79
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,443
(<i> sighs</i> )

80
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,779
New Sydney... it's in
the Sappora system, right?

81
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:16,989
Right.

82
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,159
I want a written report

83
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,036
detailing everything
you know about this woman,

84
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,996
O'Brien's plan to find her,

85
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:26,081
and everything else you
neglected to mention to me.

86
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,625
Aye, sir. May I ask
what you're going to do?

87
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,418
No, you may not,

88
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,962
and I want that report
on my desk within the hour.

89
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,476
And since your family
still lives

90
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,520
in the Sappora system,
I thought they might have

91
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,438
a few contacts
on New Sydney.

92
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,191
I'm sure they do.

93
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,734
My mother's one of
the more important

94
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,276
business leaders
in the system.

95
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,445
Your personnel file
says she owns

96
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,948
the fifth largest
pergium mining facility

97
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,991
in the entire sector.

98
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,868
Actually, it's
the sixth now.

99
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,995
The Ferengi found
a large deposit

100
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,663
on Timor II
a few years ago.

101
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,665
My mother nearly
had a heart attack

102
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,835
when she found out
we'd been knocked
out of the top five.

103
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,253
Please.

104
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,838
Do you think
she'd be willing

105
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,965
to intervene
with the local authorities,

106
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,633
to look into what happened
to the Chief?

107
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,594
Oh, I'm sure she would.

108
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:24,223
That's the first good news
I've heard all day.

109
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,976
Something wrong?

110
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:30,771
No.

111
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,564
Yes.

112
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,690
I don't know.

113
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,193
(<i> sighing</i> )

114
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:39,279
I haven't talked to my mother
in almost six months.

115
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,697
Oh.

116
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,116
The last time
I saw her

117
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,034
was just after I was joined.

118
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:46,036
She came to visit me on Trill,

119
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:48,329
and I was still
a little confused.

120
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,540
When she walked into my room,

121
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,542
I put on a big smile,
looked her right in the eye

122
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:56,088
and said, "Hi, Mom.
It's me-- Curzon."

123
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,506
Things kind of went
downhill from there.

124
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:02,427
I'm sure she understood
what you were going through.

125
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,679
You weren't prepared
to be joined.

126
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,682
She couldn't blame you
for being confused.

127
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,559
She didn't, not really,

128
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:13,772
but she did want me
to come home to recuperate,

129
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,233
and we had a... disagreement.

130
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:17,985
Not for the first time?

131
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,654
No, not for the first time.

132
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,076
If there was any other way,
I wouldn't ask you to do this.

133
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:29,537
No. That's all right.

134
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,039
I mean, my family problems

135
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,749
aren't as important
as finding the Chief.

136
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,626
I'll call my mother right away.

137
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,128
Thanks, old man.

138
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,754
Any time.

139
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,804
We've been worried about you.

140
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,597
I'm all right.

141
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,099
Really.

142
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,684
And I'm a lot more sure
of who I am

143
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,269
than the last time you saw me.

144
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:54,479
Well, that's a relief.

145
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,355
I'd hate to have to start
calling you Curzon.

146
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,528
I, uh... I've been promoted.

147
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,863
Oh?

148
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,072
Lieutenant Junior Grade

149
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,949
Ezri Dax, at your service.

150
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,285
Ezri Dax?

151
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,245
The symbiont name
always replaces

152
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,371
the family name
of the new host.

153
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,581
It's traditional.

154
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,334
Of course it is.

155
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:17,127
I haven't been away
from Trill that long.

156
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,754
The important thing
is you're doing well.

157
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:24,634
Mother, I'm calling
because I need your help.

158
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,887
One of our officers,
Miles O'Brien,

159
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,347
went to New Sydney

160
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,307
three weeks ago,
and now he's missing.

161
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:33,101
Captain Sisko was wondering
if maybe you could...

162
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,686
I'll do everything I can.

163
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,813
Thank you.

164
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:39,358
Now... when are you coming home?

165
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:42,110
I'm not sure
when I can get away.

166
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,696
Ezri, you haven't been home
in three years.

167
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,281
I know,

168
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,825
but with the war on
and everything...

169
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:52,746
Ezri Tigan-- Dax-- you tell
your Commanding Officer

170
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,831
that your mother
is a very difficult woman

171
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,376
and that she refuses
to help look for Mr. O'Brien

172
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,419
unless you're allowed
to return home right away.

173
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,755
Mother, no.

174
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:02,797
Please don't put me in this...

175
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,217
Ezri, goodbye.

176
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,885
I'll see you when you get here.

177
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,260
Here. Take
20 milligrams

178
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:13,636
at the first sign
of spacesickness.

179
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,805
If you don't,
you'll regret it.

180
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,432
So will
the other passengers.

181
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:20,101
Everything Starfleet knows
on Bilby and his widow.

182
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,353
Where's your report?

183
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:22,812
Oh, it's in there.

184
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,147
It's the one with
Captain Sisko's

185
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,106
boot prints all over it.

186
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,525
Don't worry.

187
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,650
I'm sure you'll be
out of the doghouse

188
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,609
by the time I get back.

189
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,736
I hope so.

190
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,831
Would it help if I said
that, as someone

191
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:45,335
who isn't especially
close to his parents,

192
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,045
I sympathize?

193
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,881
I'm about to present my family
with a whole new Ezri,

194
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,383
and to tell you the truth,

195
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,927
they didn't really know
what to make of the old one.

196
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,264
But thanks
for trying, Julian.

197
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,639
I'll let you know

198
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,766
as soon as I find out
anything about Miles.

199
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,142
Well, have a safe trip.

200
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:55,905
Zee.

201
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:56,990
Norvo.

202
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,659
I cannot believe

203
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,827
you're really here.

204
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,455
Neither can I.

205
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,872
You cut your hair.

206
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,626
Oh... yeah,
it kept getting in my eyes.

207
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,043
Do you like it?

208
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,837
Takes some getting used to.

209
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:14,715
I think you've just summed up
my entire visit.

210
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,301
Is this yours?

211
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,927
NORVO:
Mom insisted

212
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,137
on hanging it in here.

213
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,263
I hate it.

214
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,431
Why?

215
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,723
Well, the composition

216
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,184
is puerile and obvious,

217
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,060
the colors belong
on a child's toy,

218
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,854
and the technique is laughable.

219
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,772
But other than that?

220
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:30,940
It's perfect.

221
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,236
Welcome home,
little girl.

222
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,280
Hi, Janel.

223
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,282
Do I have to take
a sonic shower

224
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,575
before I get a hug?

225
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,041
It's good to see you.

226
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,584
You, too.

227
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:50,918
What happened here?

228
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,253
She cut it.

229
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,796
I think it brings
out her eyes,

230
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,465
gives her more
of a classic look.

231
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:56,757
It's cute.

232
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,925
Um, Mom's on her way.

233
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,594
She said to give you

234
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,720
the preliminary police report
on your friend.

235
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,515
Have they
found out anything?

236
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:04,599
Not yet.

237
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,771
But they have a few leads.

238
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,818
I hope you appreciate
all the trouble

239
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,153
she's going to.

240
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:18,655
She called in a lot of favors

241
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,198
from the New Sydney police.

242
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,577
Of course I appreciate it.

243
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,579
So how long
are you staying?

244
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,663
I'm not sure yet.

245
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,081
JANEL:
She's not going

246
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,291
to be here a minute
longer than she has to.

247
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,834
You know that.

248
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,545
We're in the middle
of a war, Janel.

249
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,214
I have responsibilities
back on DS9.

250
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,924
There's always something.

251
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,011
(<i> sighs</i> )

252
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,555
Hello, Mother.

253
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,223
I hate your hair.

254
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,474
(<i> laughs</i> )

255
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,144
Oh...

256
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,355
Have you eaten?

257
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:53,732
No, not yet.

258
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,774
Good, because I've
got Korella working

259
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,026
on a very special dinner.

260
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,653
Have you taken care
of Lorkin?

261
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,488
I was just going to contact him.

262
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,699
I want him paid and gone
before dinner's ready.

263
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:03,824
Yes, ma'am.

264
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,285
And what about that

265
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,536
third quarter review
I asked you for?

266
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:07,870
I'm still working on it.

267
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,456
You've been working on it
for a week now.

268
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,667
I miscalculated
some of the revenues.

269
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,127
I have to redo them.

270
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,337
I know you don't like
doing the bookkeeping,

271
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,506
but I really need that review
as soon as possible, all right?

272
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:19,758
Good.

273
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:22,969
I want to show<i> you</i>
the new solarium.

274
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,180
I had these tiles all
brought in from Andoria,

275
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,683
and then hand-painted
by this very charming old man...

276
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,185
Have Mr. Lorkin report
to the main house.

277
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,646
Yes, sir.

278
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,272
Why are you getting
rid of Lorkin?

279
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,440
That broken waveguide

280
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,317
in 14-3-A is going to cost us

281
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,319
a thousand bars
of latinum a day.

282
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,614
Mother thinks it's the result
of sloppy maintenance.

283
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,073
What do you think?

284
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,117
I think a brand-new waveguide

285
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,620
doesn't just break.

286
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:51,456
You mean...
Bokar was behind it?

287
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,750
He's trying
to send us a message.

288
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:57,378
The Orion Syndicate
doesn't take no for an answer.

289
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,755
Maybe we should tell Mother.

290
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,381
No.

291
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,342
I can deal with Bokar.

292
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,636
I don't know...

293
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,471
Relax.

294
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,391
Everything's going
to be all right.

295
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:30,537
EZRI:
Jadzia considered Kira
to be one of her best friends,

296
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,039
and I'm starting to think
of her the same way.

297
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,708
We spend a lot
of time together.

298
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,584
She didn't have any trouble

299
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:40,046
adjusting to having a...
new Dax in her life?

300
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,922
Well, no more
than anyone else.

301
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,842
I don't really think
any of them

302
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,886
were expecting another Dax
to walk into their lives.

303
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,179
Hmm. Did any
of them wonder...

304
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,848
MOTHER:
Whatever happened

305
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:50,890
to that young man
you were interested in

306
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,016
on the<i> Destiny?</i>

307
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,017
It was, uh, Lieutenant,

308
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,478
uh, uh... something.

309
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,271
Brinner Finok.

310
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,481
Yes.

311
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,191
He was an Ensign.

312
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,985
I did talk to him
after I was joined... once,

313
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,571
but... I don't think

314
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,656
we're really right
for each other anymore.

315
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:09,033
He reminds me too much
of my son, Gran.

316
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,160
It makes me uncomfortable
being around him now.

317
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:17,333
Sorry.<i> Audrid's</i> son Gran.

318
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,419
I'm still
sorting out my pronouns.

319
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,255
I'm sure all joined Trills
go through this.

320
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,798
No, just me.

321
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,008
Nothing simple for Ezri.

322
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,720
There's times when the computer
asks me to identify myself

323
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,388
and I have to think
about what to say.

324
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,098
Or worse yet,
there's days when I wake up,

325
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,267
and I don't even know
if I'm a man or a woman

326
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,602
until I pull back the covers.

327
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,733
I also have an unfortunate
tendency to ramble.

328
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:46,446
Don't be embarrassed, dear.
It's not your fault.

329
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,531
You should have gone
through years of training

330
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,116
to receive a symbiont.

331
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,034
It wasn't fair of them
to join you to Dax

332
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,787
just because you happened to be
the only Trill

333
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,246
on board.

334
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,497
I mean, it's no
surprise to me

335
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,499
you're having trouble

336
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,794
sorting out eight lifetimes
of memories and experiences.

337
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:04,130
Well, it can be
a little overwhelming at times.

338
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,048
Sure.

339
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,884
But don't you worry.

340
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:10,428
We'll take care
of you, won't we?

341
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,888
Absolutely.

342
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,055
Of course.

343
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,058
That's nice to know,

344
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,686
but I think I've got things
under control now.

345
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,730
Ezri...

346
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,065
you always were too
proud for your own good.

347
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,666
(<i> door chimes</i> )

348
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,209
Come in, Zee.

349
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,883
How did you know it was me?

350
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,551
No one else would bother
with the chime.

351
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:56,432
Hmm, I see some things
never change.

352
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:58,685
Here...

353
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,730
have a seat.

354
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,235
How many of these are yours?

355
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,822
All of the bad ones.

356
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,323
When did you become

357
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,741
such a harsh critic
of your work?

358
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,368
Just being realistic.

359
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,077
It's amateurish, I know that.

360
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,539
It says so right there.

361
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,874
Saurian brandy?

362
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,500
Sure.

363
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,757
I should probably
get a clean one.

364
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,342
I don't care.

365
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,558
Norvo, this doesn't mean...

366
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,601
To my sister...

367
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:48,067
a shining angel
in a dark sky.

368
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,742
All right.
The Andorian Academy

369
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,535
rejected your application.

370
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:58,870
That doesn't mean

371
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,538
your work
is amateurish.

372
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,540
There are other
art schools.

373
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,875
It's the best.

374
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,961
So? You shouldn't
just quit.

375
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,633
I'm not very good, Zee.

376
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,093
I never was.

377
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:17,179
All of this...
it's an indulgence.

378
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,849
Just like my other hobbies--
poetry, music...

379
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:22,393
I can't... concentrate.

380
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,395
My mind wanders.

381
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,189
I don't have the discipline
it takes to succeed.

382
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,525
Those are Mother's words.

383
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:37,324
I know because I've
heard them, too.

384
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,952
She wasn't right about me,

385
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,620
and she's not right
about you, either.

386
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:45,041
I'm fine with the way
things turned out. Really.

387
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,793
Besides, they need me here.

388
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,378
To do what,
the family bookkeeping?

389
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,506
Norvo, you could do
so much more.

390
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,806
I'm not trying
to make you feel bad.

391
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:03,726
I just want you to know
that<i> I</i> still believe in you.

392
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:06,395
Thanks. Thank you.

393
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:11,901
Good night.

394
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:12,986
Night.

395
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,546
(<i> sighs</i> )

396
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,306
MOTHER:
I hope you're
satisfied.

397
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,391
Have you seen Norvo today?

398
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,559
No.

399
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,978
Well, maybe you should.

400
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,313
He's lying in bed
with a hangover.

401
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,024
When I woke up
this morning,

402
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,525
I found him passed out

403
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,318
in the entry room.

404
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,655
Evidently, he spent
most of the night doing this.

405
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,204
You think it's funny?

406
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:10,584
I think it's funny you think
he did this because of me.

407
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,294
He's not happy here, Mother.

408
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,754
Can't you see that?

409
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,631
That's nonsense.

410
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,675
Mother, he's defacing
his own artwork,

411
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:21,012
work you insisted on displaying
even after he objected.

412
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,262
I'm proud of him.

413
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,597
I'm trying to encourage him.

414
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,183
But what you've done

415
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,851
is made him feel
trapped and powerless.

416
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,770
You've barely spent
one night in this house,

417
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:33,191
and you think you can
analyze our entire family?

418
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,860
You don't know
your brother anymore, Ezri.

419
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:39,321
He's a fragile young man
who needs to be cared for.

420
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,490
He is a grown man
who needs his freedom.

421
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,242
You're smothering him.

422
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:46,662
How dare you come in here
and tell me how to be a mother?

423
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,664
What do you know
about raising children?

424
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:51,876
Actually, I have three...
no, four lifetimes' worth

425
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:54,170
of memories
about raising children.

426
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:56,005
I have worked and sacrificed

427
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,465
for each one of you
for over 30 years.

428
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,759
(<i> door chimes</i> )

429
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,968
Not now!

430
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,180
Sorry to interrupt, but...

431
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,768
-Miles!
-Ezri.

432
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,394
What are you doing here?

433
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:13,564
This is... my home.
This is where I live.

434
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,066
Uh... my mother.

435
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,317
I'm pleased to meet you,
Mr. O'Brien.

436
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,694
Can you...?

437
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:22,156
He wasn't very friendly
when we located him.

438
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:23,657
Neither were you.

439
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:24,825
If you'll
excuse me,

440
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,285
we're having
a problem

441
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,828
with a drill
down in 24-B.

442
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,083
Did you do this to him?

443
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,375
Just the one on the jaw.

444
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,086
The rest he got
thanks to

445
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,796
the Orion Syndicate.

446
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,548
Did you find out
anything on Bilby's wife?

447
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,759
I found<i> her.</i>

448
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,719
She's dead.

449
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,852
Thanks.

450
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:57,357
The DNA scan confirmed
that the body was Morica's.

451
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,860
She'd been dead
at least six weeks.

452
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,821
Do you have any idea
of the cause of death?

453
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,281
No.

454
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,574
The cause of death
was the Orion Syndicate.

455
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,618
There's no evidence of that.

456
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,786
I-it could have been

457
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,204
an accident.

458
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:11,330
O'BRIEN:
Oh, yeah.
She accidentally

459
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,832
hit herself in the head

460
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,374
and accidentally threw herself
in the river, huh?

461
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,919
We pull a dozen bodies
a month out of that river.

462
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,504
You think
they're all Syndicate murders?

463
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,673
If it was anything like this,
yes.

464
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,341
And if you hadn't interfered,

465
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,135
I might have proved
she was murdered.

466
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:28,139
If we hadn't interfered,
you'd be dead.

467
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:30,641
When your mother called us,
we already had word

468
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,935
that a Starfleet Intelligence
Operative was trying

469
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,352
to infiltrate
the Syndicate.

470
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,562
It didn't take long

471
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,731
to realize
that it was your friend.

472
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,860
We found him being beaten up
by a pair of Nausicaans.

473
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,237
They were just trying
to scare me.

474
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,655
Why?

475
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,199
Exactly.

476
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,075
Why were they trying
to scare me?

477
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,703
Because I had found the body
of Morica Bilby,

478
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,539
and they didn't want me to
trace the murder back to them.

479
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,915
The Syndicate
would never kill

480
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,583
the widow of
an operative.

481
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,418
The only thing holding
them together is

482
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,920
this loyalty they show

483
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,421
to operatives
and their families.

484
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,216
They may not be
as loyal as you think.

485
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,558
Mrs. Tigan, please contact
us if there's anything else

486
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,684
we can do for you.

487
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,186
Thank you.
I will.

488
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,524
Ezri, why don't you show
Mr. O'Brien

489
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:21,817
to one of our guest rooms.

490
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:23,819
Let him clean up
and have something to eat.

491
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,532
Thanks.

492
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:36,123
...so that tip led me
to the river.

493
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,376
I searched the south bank
for about three hours

494
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,459
before I found her.

495
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,838
The organic solvents
in the water

496
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,132
had partially
decomposed her body...

497
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,842
but it was her.

498
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:48,594
I'm sorry, Chief.

499
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,889
I wish there was
something more I could do.

500
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,891
Maybe you could put in
a good word for me

501
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,726
with Captain Sisko.

502
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:58,436
It may take a lot of good words,
but I'll talk to him.

503
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,398
Mr. O'Brien,

504
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,648
how are you feeling?

505
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,025
Fine, thank you.

506
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,693
I've eaten enough for a week.

507
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,195
Glad to hear it.

508
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:07,821
I understand that
you're an engineer.

509
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,323
That's right.

510
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,409
He's not a<i> mining</i> engineer.

511
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,577
We have a problem
with a transsonic drill

512
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:16,580
that no one on my staff
seems capable of fixing,

513
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,624
and I would appreciate
it very much

514
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,376
if you would be kind
enough to take a look at it.

515
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:23,503
Now?
Mother, he needs some rest.

516
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,881
How much rest do you require,
Mr. O'Brien?

517
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:28,592
Actually, I feel fine.

518
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,386
Thank you.

519
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:31,553
I'll see you at dinner.

520
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,392
I'm sorry about this.

521
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,311
Our mother's a force of nature.

522
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:39,728
It's all right.

523
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,439
It'll be good to get my hands

524
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,023
on a problem I can solve
for a change.

525
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,900
Lead on.

526
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,392
Good morning.

527
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,269
Good<i> afternoon.</i>

528
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:22,396
Oh.

529
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,402
(<i> groans</i> )

530
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:31,030
Mother is not going
to be happy about this.

531
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:34,574
Don't worry. You're out of
the line of fire for the moment.

532
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,869
She's too busy
torturing Janel and Miles.

533
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,829
Miles?

534
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,039
Oh, your friend.

535
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,081
They found him?

536
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:42,458
He's fine.

537
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,127
Great.
That's great, Zee.

538
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:47,213
Does that mean
you're leaving?

539
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,048
Not right away.

540
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,593
Let's talk about you.

541
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,221
(<i> chuckles</i> )

542
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:58,140
More specifically,
about what you did last night.

543
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:00,434
What can I say?

544
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:02,560
I get drunk,
I become an art critic.

545
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,689
Do you regret what you did?

546
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,607
Not really.

547
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,194
I never liked
those pieces anyway.

548
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:16,658
So, what are you feeling?

549
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,996
I'm feeling like I don't want
to be analyzed by my sister.

550
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,499
Sorry.

551
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:24,791
It's what I do.

552
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:30,464
This situation is
not that complex, Zee.

553
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:33,842
I am wallowing in self-pity

554
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:36,762
and acting out my frustrations
by throwing tantrums.

555
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:40,057
All right, Dr. Norvo.

556
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:44,019
If that's your diagnosis,
what's your prescription?

557
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:46,021
Mother disapproves
of suicide--

558
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:47,773
all that blood
on the carpets.

559
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,691
Not funny.

560
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,444
Best I can do
with a hangover.

561
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:56,156
Norvo...

562
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,409
what would happen if you
left with me tomorrow?

563
00:26:58,451 --> 00:26:59,743
What do you mean?

564
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,661
I mean, what would happen

565
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,621
if you went back
to Deep Space 9 with me?

566
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,209
Mother would go insane.

567
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:09,002
Forget about her for the moment.

568
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,922
I can't... I can't
just pick up and leave.

569
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,093
Well, it doesn't have
to be a permanent move.

570
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,971
Think of it as a vacation--
a break from all of this,

571
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,765
some time to clear your head,
that's all.

572
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,517
I... I don't know

573
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,394
if I can leave all of this
on Janel's shoulders.

574
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:28,314
-Janel can handle it.
-It's not that simple.

575
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,358
There are some things
going on that are complicated.

576
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:33,569
Like what?

577
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,822
Things with the company.

578
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,824
No offense, Norvo,

579
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,494
but you're not exactly holding
the company together.

580
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:44,288
Mother can pay a real accountant
to do the work she's given you.

581
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,915
I don't... I don't know, Zee.

582
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:48,792
Well, think about it.

583
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,339
(<i> hum of machinery</i> )

584
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,510
You're right.
The problem's definitely

585
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:59,595
in the secondary
input transtator.

586
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:01,639
But the transtator
checks out perfectly.

587
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,432
I'm sure it does,

588
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:05,976
but it's the wrong
transtator for this drill.

589
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,811
What?

590
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,062
You need a 52-J.

591
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,688
This is a 52-L.

592
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,483
It says 52-J.

593
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:15,569
I know,
but it's definitely an "L."

594
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,155
Must have been
accidentally mislabeled.

595
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,823
Or deliberately.

596
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,242
MALE:
Another equipment
failure?

597
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,788
Perhaps if you hadn't
dismissed Mr. Lorkin,

598
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,415
this wouldn't have happened.

599
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:31,335
He was dismissed
on my mother's personal order.

600
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:34,672
Then we'll have to find a way
of changing her mind, won't we?

601
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,468
Who's your new mechanic, Janel?

602
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,927
This is Mr. O'Brien.

603
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,222
He's a friend of the family.

604
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:46,433
That wouldn't be
<i>Chief O'Brien,</i> would it?

605
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,227
How did you know that?

606
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,521
I have several friends
in the New Sydney police.

607
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:54,441
I heard they recently rescued
a Starfleet Chief named O'Brien

608
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,193
from an unpleasant situation.

609
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,696
That's me.

610
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,573
I don't believe
I caught your name.

611
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,782
Thadial Bokar.

612
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,660
I'm a commodities broker

613
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:06,912
attempting to establish
business ties

614
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,373
with the illustrious
Tigan family.

615
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,625
Will you excuse us
for a moment, Chief?

616
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:15,128
Mr. Bokar and I have
some business to discuss.

617
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,838
Thank you for your help.

618
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,465
I'll have a new transtator
installed right away.

619
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:19,592
Glad to do it.

620
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:28,850
Sabotaging our drills isn't
going to convince me

621
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,186
to do more business
with the Orion Syndicate.

622
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:32,979
We'll argue
about that later.

623
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,441
We have more immediate concerns.

624
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,735
O'Brien is with
Starfleet Intelligence.

625
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,361
No, he isn't.

626
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,447
He works with my sister
on Deep Space 9.

627
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,823
That may be what
he wants you to think,

628
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,325
but why was he on New Sydney

629
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:46,577
trying to infiltrate
the Syndicate?

630
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:48,704
He was looking for some woman.

631
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:50,748
"Some woman."

632
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,708
Do you know the name
of this woman?

633
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,751
No.

634
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,960
Well, I do.

635
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,421
Her name was Morica Bilby.

636
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,882
What?

637
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,926
Now, of course, I haven't heard
from Morica Bilby

638
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,844
in quite some time.

639
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,765
Rumor has it that she's dead,
but I wouldn't know anything

640
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,182
about that.

641
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,768
What I do know
is that Chief O'Brien

642
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,687
should leave this system
quickly,

643
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:16,774
before something
happens to him.

644
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:28,952
So, you're not leaving
until tomorrow?

645
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,162
Well, probably.

646
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,163
It really depends on Ezri.

647
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,872
Why?

648
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,750
Well, she's
my superior officer.

649
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:36,502
I go when she goes.

650
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:40,839
Besides, I'm not looking
forward to seeing
Captain Sisko.

651
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,425
He has a boot
with my name on it.

652
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,511
This isn't a good time
for guests.

653
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,012
There's a lot of work to do.

654
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,181
The quicker you're
on your way, the better.

655
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:02,861
Your brother seems eager
to get rid of us.

656
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,237
Oh, don't mind him.

657
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,823
He's been under
a lot of pressure.

658
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:10,661
Do you know a man
named Thadial Bokar?

659
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:13,622
Says he's
a commodities broker.

660
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,415
No.

661
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,751
But I make it a point
to know as little as possible

662
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:19,837
about the family business.

663
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,505
Why?

664
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:24,508
Well, he came to the mine
to talk with Janel

665
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,719
while I was working
on the drill.

666
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,970
There was something about him
reminded me of when I was

667
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,264
working undercover
with the Orion Syndicate--

668
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,808
you know,
something about the way

669
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,476
they dealt with civilians.

670
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:37,437
You think this Mr. Bokar
is a member of the Syndicate?

671
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,815
It's just a feeling...

672
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:42,526
and a pretty strong feeling.

673
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:44,194
We should tell Janel.

674
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,030
I think Janel already knows.

675
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:50,743
Well, I know
I'm not offering you

676
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,285
any hard evidence here,
Lieutenant,

677
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,496
but your brother seems
like a man

678
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:57,332
who's being pressured
by the Syndicate.

679
00:31:57,374 --> 00:32:00,126
He's experiencing
sudden equipment breakdowns,

680
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:04,673
work stoppages,
mysterious accidents.

681
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:06,258
That's the way the Syndicate

682
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,468
extorts money
from legitimate companies.

683
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,012
"Do business with us
or we'll ruin you."

684
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,141
Janel is not someone
who is easily intimidated,

685
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,603
and my mother-- she would burn
this place to the ground

686
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,730
before she did business
with the Syndicate.

687
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:22,148
Well, there's one way
to find out.

688
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,609
Do you have access

689
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,485
to the company's
financial records?

690
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:34,202
What would you do
on Deep Space 9?

691
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,079
Take a vacation.

692
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,748
Clear my head.

693
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:38,749
Clear your head of what?

694
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:40,709
I-I don't know.

695
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,544
Then why do you need
a vacation?

696
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:43,879
I guess I don't, really.

697
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:45,338
I just... but
it would be nice

698
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,632
to spend some
time with Ezri.

699
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:47,758
You're spending time

700
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,217
with her right now,
aren't you?

701
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:50,552
Yes...

702
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:52,971
We're ready to open
25 Beta.

703
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,556
I'll be right there.

704
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:56,099
Norvo, this is
a very bad time

705
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,476
for you to take
a vacation.

706
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,811
We have far too
much work to do.

707
00:32:58,852 --> 00:32:59,853
Have you finished

708
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:00,979
the review?

709
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,355
Almost.

710
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,399
Well, then maybe
you should get to it.

711
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:05,859
Yes, ma'am.

712
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:12,407
Let's go.

713
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:19,665
Now I remember why I never went
into the family business--

714
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,125
all these contracts
and invoices,

715
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,168
balance sheets

716
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,962
and shipping orders.
Ugh!

717
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,338
I feel like I'm trapped

718
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,089
in some kind
of Ferengi nightmare.

719
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,425
What?

720
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:37,390
What is it?

721
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,642
I don't know.

722
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,561
What's going on here?

723
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,480
What do you mean?

724
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,565
Did you come here to find me

725
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,943
or to prevent me
finding out the truth?

726
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:50,654
I don't know
what you're talking about,

727
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:53,031
so maybe
you should just tell me, Chief.

728
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:55,492
The connection between
the Orion Syndicate

729
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,118
and your family...

730
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,745
is Morica Bilby.

731
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,707
She was on the company's
payroll when she died.

732
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:04,501
Did you know about this?

733
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:07,420
No. Of course not.

734
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,465
Well, someone
in your family did.

735
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,091
And since they
didn't mention it,

736
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,385
they obviously
don't want us to know.

737
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,220
Are you suggesting...?

738
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,347
I'm not<i> suggesting</i> anything,

739
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,641
but you have to face
the possibility

740
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:21,601
that somebody in your family...

741
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,687
was involved in her death.

742
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:32,070
There.
Nine months ago.

743
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:34,322
Morica Bilby shows up
on the payroll

744
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:36,074
as a shipping consultant.

745
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,952
Five bars of latinum
a week for services rendered.

746
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,996
What services?

747
00:34:41,038 --> 00:34:43,498
There's no
cross-reference,

748
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,167
no indication of what she
was doing for the company.

749
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,920
Whatever it was, she must
have been good at the job.

750
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,128
Look here.

751
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,757
Her salary increases
to ten bars a week,

752
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,508
then 20, then 30.

753
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,511
The last payment entry
was six weeks ago.

754
00:34:57,888 --> 00:35:00,098
The day before she was killed.

755
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,438
Who's in charge of the payroll?

756
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:12,069
My mother... ultimately,
but she's turned over

757
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,654
most of the day-to-day
operations to Janel,

758
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:17,908
and Norvo's been doing
the bookkeeping.

759
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:21,411
Any one of them could know
about Morica's payments.

760
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:24,205
Or all of them.

761
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:27,918
Lieutenant,
we have to show this

762
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,544
to the authorities
on New Sydney.

763
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,547
Not yet.

764
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,466
Not until I find out
what's happened.

765
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,136
That's an order.

766
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:41,640
Yes, sir.

767
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:51,357
Why was this woman
on our payroll?

768
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,027
We were returning
a favor.

769
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:54,987
To whom?

770
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:56,696
To the Orion Syndicate.

771
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:59,741
And what "favor"
did they do for us?

772
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:05,246
Remember when the Ferengi
opened up the Timor II mine

773
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,540
and there was a ten-point drop
in the price of pergium?

774
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,918
Well, that came
at a bad moment.

775
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,670
We were overextended
on some loans,

776
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,546
our cash reserves were depleted,

777
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,133
and a Jem'Hadar raid
destroyed an entire shipment

778
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,593
before it reached the refinery
on Rigel IV.

779
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,386
So you turned
to the Syndicate?

780
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,097
They came to me.

781
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:24,599
They offered us a way out,
and I took it.

782
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,351
I did what I had to do.

783
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,686
And I don't remember

784
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,146
you asking a lot
of questions

785
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,523
when our cash problems
were resolved overnight.

786
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,525
Because I trusted you.

787
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:36,235
Obviously,
it was a mistake.

788
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,737
What about Morica?

789
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:41,282
About a month after
Bokar arranged the loan,

790
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,868
he came to me and said

791
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,285
it was time
to return the favor.

792
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,745
There was a woman
who needed a job

793
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:47,080
with a salary

794
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,499
but without
any actual work involved.

795
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,918
He said she was the widow
of one of their associates

796
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,504
and they needed
to take care of her.

797
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,506
I didn't feel like

798
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,717
I was in a position
to say no,

799
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:03,596
so I started
making the payments.

800
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,058
No one would have been the wiser
if Norvo had altered

801
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:08,685
the payroll records
like I asked him.

802
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:11,146
You dragged your little brother
into this?

803
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:13,106
You're the one who says

804
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,733
there's nothing more important
than the company.

805
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,401
Well, that's all
I was thinking about--

806
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:17,903
the company.

807
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,779
You dumped it in my lap
and I saved it,

808
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,698
so don't start complaining now.

809
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,533
If it weren't for me,
we would have been finished.

810
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,827
Don't you rationalize
what you've done.

811
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:27,537
All right, all right.

812
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,581
We can talk about
who saved what later.

813
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,666
Right now,
we have to concentrate

814
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,168
on what happened to Morica.

815
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,627
The payroll records show

816
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,379
a steady increase
in her payments.

817
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:37,547
Why?

818
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:40,133
She wasn't happy
with her salary.

819
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:43,261
She said the Syndicate promised
her a comfortable living,

820
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:46,264
and she wasn't comfortable
on what we were paying her.

821
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,349
How did she die?

822
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,602
I don't know.

823
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:56,066
Janel... if you have anything
to do with this,

824
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:57,817
now is the time to speak.

825
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:01,029
What are you saying?
That I had her killed?

826
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:02,572
I'm asking!

827
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,199
Mother, he wouldn't
have killed her.

828
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:05,366
You stay out of this.

829
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:09,537
Listen to me.

830
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:11,831
I will get you the very best
solicitor in New Sydney,

831
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,833
but you must tell me the truth.

832
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:16,753
I didn't kill her.

833
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,880
Oh, Janel,
why don't I believe you?

834
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:20,632
Why don't I believe
that this woman

835
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,135
just happened to die
at the exact moment

836
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:24,677
she was pressuring you
for more money?

837
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,554
Why won't you
listen to him?

838
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,265
He didn't do it.

839
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,724
JANEL:
I may not have
shed any tears

840
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:31,434
when I found out
she was dead,

841
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,645
but I didn't kill her.
MOTHER:
Then who did?

842
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,605
JANEL:
The police said...

843
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:39,276
Norvo, you don't know what
happened to Morica, do you?

844
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,486
MOTHER:
Even if it was
an accident,

845
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:42,695
we are going to hire...

846
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,990
I'm the idiot brother.

847
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,616
How would I know?

848
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:50,369
Tell me you don't know
anything about this.

849
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,209
I tried to reason with her,

850
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:59,296
but she was
very angry--

851
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,798
angry at the Syndicate,
angry at us,

852
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,092
even angry at her husband
for getting himself killed.

853
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,390
I didn't go there
to kill her, Zee.

854
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,226
I really didn't,

855
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:15,728
but she wouldn't
listen to me.

856
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,605
She started yelling.

857
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:20,150
Said that our family was
just as bad as the Syndicate,

858
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:22,568
that we were all liars

859
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,487
and cheats.

860
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,614
And then, suddenly
I realized

861
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:28,325
that if she were dead...

862
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:34,122
all of our problems
would go away.

863
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:41,296
Oh, Norvo.

864
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,601
I took care of it.

865
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,146
You always said
that I was

866
00:39:58,188 --> 00:40:01,941
too weak...
to handle the tough ones.

867
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:05,111
I'm not.

868
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,280
I proved it.

869
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:09,741
I handled a problem
that you couldn't.

870
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,827
I handled it.

871
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:34,933
I need to, uh...

872
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:39,312
inspect the ore
samples from 53-C.

873
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:42,565
We have to make
a decision

874
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:46,069
on whether to
open up a new...

875
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:48,988
Janel, forget
about the mine.

876
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,907
It doesn't matter.

877
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:56,371
I want you
to listen to me.

878
00:40:56,413 --> 00:41:00,125
After Norvo's trial is over,
you need to go.

879
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,376
Go where?

880
00:41:01,418 --> 00:41:03,753
It doesn't matter.
Just go.

881
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:06,423
Find another life
for yourself.

882
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,758
Trust me.

883
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,509
You'll be happier.

884
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,658
They've taken Norvo.

885
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,873
I'm going to stay on New Sydney
for the trial,

886
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,793
and then I'm going
to head back to Deep Space 9.

887
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,221
This isn't my fault,
is it, Ezri?

888
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,644
I didn't do this, did I?

889
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,467
Mind if I join you?

890
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:38,764
When did you get back?

891
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:39,891
Last night.

892
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,354
Norvo was sentenced
to 30 years.

893
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:50,651
I wish I could say
I was sorry, but...

894
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,696
considering what he did,
he got off easy.

895
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,743
I understand
why you feel that way,

896
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:02,205
but you didn't know him, Miles.

897
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:05,666
Norvo was very gifted.

898
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:08,294
When we were young,
he had so much potential.

899
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:10,004
Norvo was always the one

900
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:13,299
that we all thought
would be something special,

901
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:15,634
and I don't know what happened.

902
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,763
I don't know
how my brother turned into...

903
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:23,893
You know, I guess
I just spent so many years

904
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:25,644
dreaming of ways
to get out of that house

905
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:29,941
that I didn't see what
was really going on inside,

906
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:32,527
what was happening to Norvo--

907
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:35,154
the endless humiliation,

908
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:38,199
the constant drumbeat
of criticism...

909
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:43,329
the way his heart was carved up
into little pieces.

910
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,707
I should have seen it.

911
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,543
I should have tried
to stop it.

912
00:43:48,585 --> 00:43:51,003
You can't blame yourself.

913
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,506
You're not responsible
for that.

914
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:55,592
But I am, don't you see?

915
00:43:57,385 --> 00:44:00,555
I should have gone home
a long time ago.
