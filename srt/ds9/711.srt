1
00:00:02,699 --> 00:00:04,671
By the way,
your <i>gagh</i> has arrived.

2
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:05,799
My what?

3
00:00:05,843 --> 00:00:07,245
Oh, no.

4
00:00:07,281 --> 00:00:08,683
Oh, yes,
and it's waiting for you

5
00:00:08,751 --> 00:00:10,483
in Cargo Bay 2.

6
00:00:10,523 --> 00:00:11,492
Your <i>gagh?</i>

7
00:00:11,526 --> 00:00:13,623
Jadzia ordered it.

8
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:14,966
She was planning a party

9
00:00:15,003 --> 00:00:16,701
for Martok's birthday
next week.

10
00:00:16,775 --> 00:00:18,405
How much <i>gagh</i> did she order?

11
00:00:18,447 --> 00:00:20,214
51 cases.

12
00:00:20,252 --> 00:00:22,725
Each containing
a different variety.

13
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:24,354
There are varieties of <i>gagh?</i>

14
00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:27,966
Oh, yes. I can remember
what each one tastes like

15
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:31,281
and the way they feel
when you swallow them.

16
00:00:31,319 --> 00:00:33,849
<i>Torgud gagh</i> wiggles.

17
00:00:33,893 --> 00:00:35,922
<i>Filden gagh</i> squirms.

18
00:00:35,966 --> 00:00:37,664
<i>Meshta gagh</i> jumps.

19
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:40,801
Are you all right?

20
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:43,888
Are you all right?

21
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,254
Me?

22
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,766
Well, you've barely
said three words.

23
00:00:47,801 --> 00:00:48,770
Something on your mind?

24
00:00:48,804 --> 00:00:50,799
Oh, no. I just, uh...

25
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:52,816
can't wait to see Miles,
that's all.

26
00:00:52,849 --> 00:00:53,943
Oh, let me guess.

27
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:55,822
You have
a holosuite appointment...

28
00:00:55,893 --> 00:00:57,762
defending the Alamo again?

29
00:00:57,798 --> 00:00:59,929
You know me too well.

30
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:01,875
When does his transport arrive?

31
00:01:01,911 --> 00:01:02,880
Half an hour.

32
00:01:02,914 --> 00:01:04,852
<i>Bithool gagh</i> has feet.

33
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,527
Flush it out the airlock,
all of it.

34
00:01:08,564 --> 00:01:11,539
Environmental regulations.

35
00:01:11,573 --> 00:01:13,545
Well, why don't you just
give it to Martok?

36
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:17,353
He'd insist on sharing it
with me as a point of honor.

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,473
<i>Wistan gagh</i> is packed
in <i>targ</i> blood.

38
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:25,572
I have to go now.

39
00:01:25,615 --> 00:01:27,245
See you later.

40
00:01:27,286 --> 00:01:29,520
I think I'd better go, too.

41
00:01:31,064 --> 00:01:33,799
Give my regards to Santa Anna.

42
00:02:03,528 --> 00:02:04,690
What?

43
00:02:04,732 --> 00:02:06,202
Miles asked me
not to say anything

44
00:02:06,236 --> 00:02:08,037
but, uh, I haven't heard
from him in three days

45
00:02:08,075 --> 00:02:10,138
and since he wasn't on
this morning's transport

46
00:02:10,181 --> 00:02:12,210
I think something might
have happened to him.

47
00:02:12,254 --> 00:02:14,523
He told me he was going home
to visit his father.

48
00:02:14,561 --> 00:02:17,057
He may have implied that he
was going to visit his father

49
00:02:17,102 --> 00:02:18,504
but he didn't actually say it.

50
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,033
Doctor, please.

51
00:02:20,078 --> 00:02:21,913
Yes, sir.

52
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:23,442
So where is he?

53
00:02:23,487 --> 00:02:24,957
The last message
I received from him

54
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:26,552
said that he was
still in New Sydney

55
00:02:26,597 --> 00:02:28,900
and that he was following up
on some promising leads.

56
00:02:28,937 --> 00:02:30,133
He's not a detective.

57
00:02:30,175 --> 00:02:31,144
He's an engineer.

58
00:02:31,178 --> 00:02:32,773
He is my Chief Engineer

59
00:02:32,816 --> 00:02:34,411
and now he's missing.

60
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:38,262
So who is this woman he's
supposed to be looking for?

61
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:40,396
She's the widow of Liam Bilby.

62
00:02:40,438 --> 00:02:43,003
Bilby? Bilby?

63
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:46,420
The man he befriended in that
undercover operation last year?

64
00:02:46,456 --> 00:02:49,157
Yes, sir. Miles still feels
responsible for his death

65
00:02:49,198 --> 00:02:51,603
and has been in touch
with his widow ever since

66
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,135
and when she dropped
out of sight three weeks ago

67
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,155
he got worried
and decided to find her.

68
00:02:57,189 --> 00:02:59,458
And now they're both missing.
Perfect.

69
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:00,555
In his defense, sir

70
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:02,365
he did try and go through
the official channels

71
00:03:02,404 --> 00:03:03,897
but the authorities
on New Sydney

72
00:03:03,942 --> 00:03:05,674
weren't very cooperative,
to say the least

73
00:03:05,714 --> 00:03:07,275
and since it isn't
a Federation world

74
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,549
Starfleet doesn't have
any jurisdiction.

75
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:11,564
So he decided to turn
into a one-man police force.

76
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:12,863
Yes, sir.

77
00:03:14,072 --> 00:03:17,013
New Sydney... it's in
the Sappora system, right?

78
00:03:17,048 --> 00:03:18,348
Right.

79
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:20,991
I want a written report

80
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:23,329
detailing everything
you know about this woman

81
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:24,769
O'Brien's plan to find her

82
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,335
and everything else you
neglected to mention to me.

83
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:29,716
Aye, sir. May I ask
what you're going to do?

84
00:03:29,753 --> 00:03:31,280
No, you may not

85
00:03:31,324 --> 00:03:33,353
and I want that report
on my desk within the hour.

86
00:03:46,135 --> 00:03:47,628
And since your family
still lives

87
00:03:47,673 --> 00:03:49,907
in the Sappora system,
I thought they might have

88
00:03:49,947 --> 00:03:51,851
a few contacts on New Sydney.

89
00:03:51,886 --> 00:03:52,912
I'm sure they do.

90
00:03:52,956 --> 00:03:54,928
My mother's one of
the more important

91
00:03:54,962 --> 00:03:56,626
business leaders in the system.

92
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,661
Your personnel file
says she owns

93
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:01,179
the fifth largest
pergium mining facility

94
00:04:01,213 --> 00:04:02,513
in the entire sector.

95
00:04:02,551 --> 00:04:04,352
Actually, it's the sixth now.

96
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,259
The Ferengi found
a large deposit

97
00:04:06,296 --> 00:04:07,891
on Timor II a few years ago.

98
00:04:07,934 --> 00:04:09,906
My mother nearly
had a heart attack

99
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,109
when she found out we'd been
knocked out of the top five.

100
00:04:13,149 --> 00:04:14,517
Please.

101
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:16,148
Do you think she'd be willing

102
00:04:16,191 --> 00:04:18,390
to intervene
with the local authorities?

103
00:04:18,432 --> 00:04:20,096
To look into what happened
to the Chief?

104
00:04:20,137 --> 00:04:21,904
Oh, I'm sure she would.

105
00:04:21,942 --> 00:04:25,544
That's the first good news
I've heard all day.

106
00:04:28,094 --> 00:04:29,394
Something wrong?

107
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:32,131
No.

108
00:04:32,173 --> 00:04:33,871
Yes.

109
00:04:33,912 --> 00:04:35,006
I don't know.

110
00:04:37,957 --> 00:04:40,796
I haven't talked to my mother
in almost six months.

111
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:41,824
Oh.

112
00:04:41,869 --> 00:04:43,636
The last time I saw her

113
00:04:43,674 --> 00:04:45,509
was just after I was joined.

114
00:04:45,546 --> 00:04:47,575
She came to visit me on Trill

115
00:04:47,619 --> 00:04:49,750
and I was still
a little confused.

116
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:51,991
When she walked into my room

117
00:04:52,032 --> 00:04:54,061
I put on a big smile,
looked her right in the eye

118
00:04:54,105 --> 00:04:57,639
and said, "Hi, Mom.
It's me... Curzon."

119
00:04:57,682 --> 00:05:00,178
Things kind of went
downhill from there.

120
00:05:00,223 --> 00:05:03,893
I'm sure she understood
what you were going through.

121
00:05:03,935 --> 00:05:06,238
You weren't prepared
to be joined.

122
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:09,248
She couldn't blame you
for being confused.

123
00:05:09,317 --> 00:05:11,186
She didn't, not really

124
00:05:11,223 --> 00:05:15,258
but she did want me
to come home to recuperate

125
00:05:15,302 --> 00:05:17,832
and we had a... disagreement.

126
00:05:17,876 --> 00:05:19,471
Not for the first time?

127
00:05:19,515 --> 00:05:22,250
No, not for the first time.

128
00:05:24,797 --> 00:05:27,704
If there was any other way,
I wouldn't ask you to do this.

129
00:05:27,739 --> 00:05:31,079
No. That's all right.

130
00:05:31,116 --> 00:05:32,278
I mean, my family problems

131
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,314
aren't as important
as finding the Chief.

132
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:36,194
I'll call my mother right away.

133
00:05:36,231 --> 00:05:37,701
Thanks, old man.

134
00:05:37,736 --> 00:05:39,297
Any time.

135
00:05:45,693 --> 00:05:47,528
We've been worried about you.

136
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:49,229
I'm all right.

137
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,364
Really.

138
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:52,208
And I'm a lot more sure
of who I am

139
00:05:52,246 --> 00:05:53,944
than the last time you saw me.

140
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:55,319
Well, that's a relief.

141
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,954
I'd hate to have to start
calling you Curzon.

142
00:06:00,003 --> 00:06:03,172
I, uh... I've been promoted.

143
00:06:03,212 --> 00:06:04,238
Oh?

144
00:06:04,282 --> 00:06:07,588
Lieutenant Junior Grade
Ezri Dax, at your service.

145
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,989
Ezri Dax?

146
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:11,731
The symbiont name
always replaces

147
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,834
the family name
of the new host.

148
00:06:13,877 --> 00:06:15,245
It's traditional.

149
00:06:15,281 --> 00:06:16,546
Of course it is.

150
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:18,751
I haven't been away
from Trill that long.

151
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:21,391
The important thing
is you're doing well.

152
00:06:23,205 --> 00:06:26,374
Mother, I'm calling
because I need your help.

153
00:06:26,415 --> 00:06:28,410
One of our officers,
Miles O'Brien

154
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,649
went to New Sydney

155
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:32,130
three weeks ago,
and now he's missing.

156
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,833
Captain Sisko was wondering
if maybe you could...

157
00:06:34,873 --> 00:06:36,400
I'll do everything I can.

158
00:06:36,445 --> 00:06:38,440
Thank you.

159
00:06:38,552 --> 00:06:41,219
Now... when are you coming home?

160
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:43,994
I'm not sure
when I can get away.

161
00:06:44,034 --> 00:06:46,131
Ezri, you haven't been home
in three years.

162
00:06:46,174 --> 00:06:47,370
I know

163
00:06:47,411 --> 00:06:50,683
but with the war on
and everything...

164
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:52,955
Ezri Tigan... Dax...

165
00:06:52,994 --> 00:06:54,464
you tell your Commanding Officer

166
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:56,403
that your mother
is a very difficult woman

167
00:06:56,438 --> 00:06:59,037
and that she refuses
to help look for Mr. O'Brien

168
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:01,986
unless you're allowed
to return home right away.

169
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,457
Mother, no.

170
00:07:03,492 --> 00:07:04,586
Please don't put me in...

171
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,103
Ezri, good-bye.

172
00:07:07,137 --> 00:07:08,630
I'll see you when you get here.

173
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,648
Here. Take 20 milligrams

174
00:09:12,688 --> 00:09:13,884
at the first sign
of spacesickness.

175
00:09:13,926 --> 00:09:15,419
If you don't,
you'll regret it.

176
00:09:15,464 --> 00:09:17,436
So will the other passengers.

177
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,035
Everything Starfleet knows
on Bilby and his widow.

178
00:09:20,077 --> 00:09:21,273
Where's your report?

179
00:09:21,314 --> 00:09:22,283
Oh, it's in there.

180
00:09:22,317 --> 00:09:23,685
It's the one
with Captain Sisko's

181
00:09:23,721 --> 00:09:24,747
boot-prints all over it.

182
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:25,953
Don't worry.

183
00:09:25,995 --> 00:09:27,329
I'm sure you'll be
out of the doghouse

184
00:09:27,365 --> 00:09:28,334
by the time I get back.

185
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:29,668
I hope so.

186
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:42,237
Would it help if I
said, that, as someone

187
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:45,252
who isn't especially
close to his parents

188
00:09:45,286 --> 00:09:46,516
I sympathize?

189
00:09:46,557 --> 00:09:50,022
I'm about to present my family
with a whole new Ezri

190
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,764
and to tell you the truth

191
00:09:51,805 --> 00:09:53,936
they didn't really know
what to make of the old one.

192
00:09:55,349 --> 00:09:57,446
But thanks for trying, Julian.

193
00:09:57,489 --> 00:09:58,480
I'll let you know

194
00:09:58,526 --> 00:10:00,053
as soon as I find out
anything about Miles.

195
00:10:00,097 --> 00:10:01,431
Well, have a safe trip.

196
00:10:54,627 --> 00:10:55,857
Zee.

197
00:10:55,897 --> 00:10:57,127
Norvo.

198
00:10:58,371 --> 00:11:01,312
I cannot believe
you're really here.

199
00:11:01,347 --> 00:11:03,877
Neither can I.

200
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:05,289
You cut your hair.

201
00:11:05,325 --> 00:11:08,026
Oh... yeah,
it kept getting in my eyes.

202
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:09,502
Do you like it?

203
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:11,373
Takes some getting used to.

204
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:15,218
I think you've just summed up
my entire visit.

205
00:11:15,255 --> 00:11:16,748
Is this yours?

206
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:19,563
Mom insisted
on hanging it in here.

207
00:11:19,601 --> 00:11:20,729
I hate it.

208
00:11:20,772 --> 00:11:21,900
Why?

209
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:23,138
Well, the composition

210
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:24,479
is puerile and obvious

211
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:26,488
the colors belong
on a child's toy

212
00:11:26,522 --> 00:11:28,357
and the technique is laughable.

213
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:30,263
But other than that?

214
00:11:30,334 --> 00:11:31,394
It's perfect.

215
00:11:33,744 --> 00:11:35,739
Welcome home, little girl.

216
00:11:35,783 --> 00:11:37,880
Hi, Janel.

217
00:11:37,923 --> 00:11:39,792
Do I have to take
a sonic shower

218
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:41,322
before I get a hug?

219
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:48,610
It's good to see you.

220
00:11:48,655 --> 00:11:50,125
You, too.

221
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,459
What happened here?

222
00:11:51,497 --> 00:11:52,591
She cut it.

223
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:54,228
I think it brings
out her eyes

224
00:11:54,272 --> 00:11:56,039
gives her more
of a classic look.

225
00:11:56,077 --> 00:11:57,445
It's cute.

226
00:11:57,481 --> 00:11:58,541
Um, Mom's on her way.

227
00:11:58,584 --> 00:11:59,849
She said to give you

228
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:02,294
the preliminary police report
on your friend.

229
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,925
Have they found out anything?

230
00:12:03,968 --> 00:12:05,370
Not yet.

231
00:12:08,113 --> 00:12:10,986
But they have a few leads.

232
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:16,438
I hope you appreciate
all the trouble

233
00:12:16,472 --> 00:12:17,772
she's going to.

234
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:19,302
She called in a lot of favors

235
00:12:19,347 --> 00:12:20,783
from the New Sydney police.

236
00:12:20,818 --> 00:12:24,055
Of course I appreciate it.

237
00:12:24,094 --> 00:12:26,259
So how long are you staying?

238
00:12:26,301 --> 00:12:27,497
I'm not sure yet.

239
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,734
She's not going

240
00:12:28,776 --> 00:12:30,873
to be here
a minute longer than she has to.

241
00:12:30,915 --> 00:12:32,145
You know that.

242
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:34,282
We're in the middle
of a war, Janel.

243
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:36,821
I have responsibilities
back on DS9.

244
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:38,496
There's always something.

245
00:12:42,683 --> 00:12:44,153
Hello, Mother.

246
00:12:44,188 --> 00:12:45,886
I hate your hair.

247
00:12:49,704 --> 00:12:50,832
Oh...

248
00:12:51,845 --> 00:12:52,905
Have you eaten?

249
00:12:52,948 --> 00:12:54,144
No, not yet.

250
00:12:54,184 --> 00:12:56,156
Good, because I've
got Korella working

251
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,592
on a very special dinner.

252
00:12:57,628 --> 00:12:59,292
Have you taken care
of Lorkin?

253
00:12:59,334 --> 00:13:01,306
I was just going to contact him.

254
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,403
I want him paid and gone
before dinner's ready.

255
00:13:03,446 --> 00:13:04,415
Yes, ma'am.

256
00:13:04,516 --> 00:13:05,542
And what about that

257
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,215
third quarter review
I asked you for?

258
00:13:07,257 --> 00:13:08,591
I'm still working on it.

259
00:13:08,628 --> 00:13:10,258
You've been working on it
for a week now.

260
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:13,206
I miscalculated
some of the revenues.

261
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:14,905
I have to redo them.

262
00:13:14,947 --> 00:13:16,782
I know you don't like
doing the bookkeeping

263
00:13:16,818 --> 00:13:19,189
but I really need that review
as soon as possible, all right?

264
00:13:19,226 --> 00:13:20,560
Good.

265
00:13:20,597 --> 00:13:23,663
I want to show you
the new solarium.

266
00:13:23,706 --> 00:13:26,840
I had these tiles all
brought in from Andoria

267
00:13:26,883 --> 00:13:29,254
and then hand-painted
by this very charming old man...

268
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:31,785
Have Mr. Lorkin report
to the main house.

269
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,958
Yes, sir.

270
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:34,870
Why are you getting
rid of Lorkin?

271
00:13:34,907 --> 00:13:37,973
That broken waveguide
in 14-3-A is going to cost us

272
00:13:38,016 --> 00:13:40,045
a thousand bars
of latinum a day.

273
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:43,361
Mother thinks it's the result
of sloppy maintenance.

274
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:44,767
What do you think?

275
00:13:44,802 --> 00:13:46,797
I think a brand-new waveguide

276
00:13:46,842 --> 00:13:48,437
doesn't just break.

277
00:13:49,484 --> 00:13:52,357
You mean... Bokar was behind it?

278
00:13:52,392 --> 00:13:54,557
He's trying
to send us a message.

279
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:58,165
The Orion Syndicate
doesn't take no for an answer.

280
00:13:58,209 --> 00:13:59,543
Maybe we should tell Mother.

281
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,982
No.

282
00:14:01,018 --> 00:14:03,183
I can deal with Bokar.

283
00:14:03,224 --> 00:14:05,321
I don't know...

284
00:14:05,364 --> 00:14:07,336
Relax.

285
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:11,181
Everything's going
to be all right.

286
00:14:27,803 --> 00:14:30,835
Jadzia considered Kira
to be one of her best friends

287
00:14:30,878 --> 00:14:33,374
and I'm starting to think
of her the same way.

288
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:35,151
We spend a lot of time together.

289
00:14:35,192 --> 00:14:36,822
She didn't have any trouble

290
00:14:36,863 --> 00:14:40,465
adjusting to having a...
new Dax in her life?

291
00:14:40,508 --> 00:14:42,343
Well, no more than anyone else.

292
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,181
I don't really think any of them

293
00:14:44,286 --> 00:14:47,318
were expecting another Dax
to walk into their lives.

294
00:14:47,361 --> 00:14:48,421
Hmm. Did any of them wonder...

295
00:14:48,464 --> 00:14:49,764
Whatever happened

296
00:14:49,802 --> 00:14:51,170
to that young man
you were interested in

297
00:14:51,206 --> 00:14:52,175
on the <i>Destiny?</i>

298
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:55,743
It was, uh, Lieutenant,
uh, uh... something.

299
00:14:55,787 --> 00:14:57,725
Brinner Finok.

300
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:58,728
Yes.

301
00:14:58,762 --> 00:14:59,890
He was an Ensign.

302
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:03,375
I did talk to him
after I was joined... once

303
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:05,004
but... I don't think

304
00:15:05,047 --> 00:15:06,985
we're really right
for each other anymore.

305
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,425
He reminds me too much
of my son, Gran.

306
00:15:09,461 --> 00:15:11,626
It makes me uncomfortable
being around him now.

307
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,412
Sorry. Audrid's son Gran.

308
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:20,016
I'm still
sorting out my pronouns.

309
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:22,760
I'm sure all joined Trills
go through this.

310
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:24,203
No, just me.

311
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:26,508
Nothing simple for Ezri.

312
00:15:26,545 --> 00:15:29,212
There's times when the computer
asks me to identify myself

313
00:15:29,254 --> 00:15:30,690
and I have to think
about what to say.

314
00:15:30,725 --> 00:15:32,560
Or worse yet,
there's days when I wake up

315
00:15:32,596 --> 00:15:34,625
and I don't even know
if I'm a man or a woman

316
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,038
until I pull back the covers.

317
00:15:38,448 --> 00:15:42,290
I also have an unfortunate
tendency to ramble.

318
00:15:44,532 --> 00:15:46,835
Don't be embarrassed, dear.
It's not your fault.

319
00:15:46,873 --> 00:15:48,868
You should have gone
through years of training

320
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:50,542
to receive a symbiont.

321
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:52,556
It wasn't fair of them
to join you to Dax

322
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,325
just because you happened to be
the only Trill on board.

323
00:15:55,398 --> 00:15:57,963
I mean, it's no surprise to me
you're having trouble

324
00:15:58,006 --> 00:16:01,540
sorting out eight lifetimes
of memories and experiences.

325
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:04,649
Well, it can be
a little overwhelming at times.

326
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:06,460
Sure.

327
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:08,470
But don't you worry.

328
00:16:08,504 --> 00:16:11,000
We'll take care of you,
won't we?

329
00:16:11,045 --> 00:16:12,310
Absolutely.

330
00:16:12,383 --> 00:16:13,648
Of course.

331
00:16:14,656 --> 00:16:16,594
That's nice to know

332
00:16:16,628 --> 00:16:19,261
but I think I've got things
under control now.

333
00:16:19,304 --> 00:16:21,036
Ezri...

334
00:16:21,075 --> 00:16:23,640
you always were too
proud for your own good.

335
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:42,830
Come in, Zee.

336
00:16:47,655 --> 00:16:49,524
How did you know it was me?

337
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,190
No one else would bother
with the chime.

338
00:16:53,406 --> 00:16:57,042
Hmm, I see some things
never change.

339
00:16:58,086 --> 00:16:59,214
Here...

340
00:17:01,496 --> 00:17:03,297
have a seat.

341
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:08,948
How many of these are yours?

342
00:17:08,985 --> 00:17:11,515
All of the bad ones.

343
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,688
When did you become

344
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,428
such a harsh critic
of your work?

345
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:15,995
Just being realistic.

346
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,738
It's amateurish, I know that.

347
00:17:17,778 --> 00:17:19,180
It says so right there.

348
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,619
Saurian brandy?

349
00:17:21,656 --> 00:17:23,217
Sure.

350
00:17:28,511 --> 00:17:30,483
I should probably
get a clean one.

351
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,053
I don't care.

352
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:39,134
Norvo, this doesn't mean...

353
00:17:39,176 --> 00:17:41,341
To my sister...

354
00:17:45,093 --> 00:17:48,935
a shining angel in a dark sky.

355
00:17:54,755 --> 00:17:56,487
All right.
The Andorian Academy

356
00:17:56,528 --> 00:17:58,158
rejected your application.

357
00:17:58,199 --> 00:18:01,140
That doesn't mean
your work is amateurish.

358
00:18:01,175 --> 00:18:03,079
There are other art schools.

359
00:18:03,114 --> 00:18:04,344
It's the best.

360
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:07,553
So? You shouldn't just quit.

361
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,400
I'm not very good, Zee.

362
00:18:13,445 --> 00:18:14,972
I never was.

363
00:18:15,017 --> 00:18:17,513
All of this...
it's an indulgence.

364
00:18:17,557 --> 00:18:20,691
Just like my other hobbies...
poetry, music...

365
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:22,728
I can't... concentrate.

366
00:18:22,773 --> 00:18:24,938
My mind wanders.

367
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,978
I don't have the discipline
it takes to succeed.

368
00:18:28,022 --> 00:18:30,393
Those are Mother's words.

369
00:18:35,578 --> 00:18:38,143
I know,
because I've heard them, too.

370
00:18:38,186 --> 00:18:39,520
She wasn't right about me

371
00:18:39,557 --> 00:18:41,620
and she's not right
about you, either.

372
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:45,299
I'm fine with the way
things turned out. Really.

373
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,779
Besides, they need me here.

374
00:18:47,814 --> 00:18:50,253
To do what,
the family bookkeeping?

375
00:18:50,288 --> 00:18:53,388
Norvo, you could do
so much more.

376
00:18:58,479 --> 00:19:00,816
I'm not trying
to make you feel bad.

377
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:04,627
I just want you to know
that I still believe in you.

378
00:19:04,665 --> 00:19:07,332
Thanks. Thank you.

379
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:12,752
Good night.

380
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:13,951
Night.

381
00:19:41,241 --> 00:19:43,270
I hope you're satisfied.

382
00:19:43,314 --> 00:19:45,286
Have you seen Norvo today?

383
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,414
No.

384
00:19:46,456 --> 00:19:48,017
Well, maybe you should.

385
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,295
He's lying in bed
with a hangover.

386
00:19:50,335 --> 00:19:51,999
When I woke up this morning

387
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,106
I found him passed out
in the entry room.

388
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:58,888
Evidently, he spent
most of the night doing this.

389
00:20:04,712 --> 00:20:06,342
You think it's funny?

390
00:20:08,356 --> 00:20:11,593
I think it's funny you think
he did this because of me.

391
00:20:11,632 --> 00:20:13,330
He's not happy here, Mother.

392
00:20:13,371 --> 00:20:14,841
Can't you see that?

393
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,314
That's nonsense.

394
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,287
Mother, he's defacing
his own artwork...

395
00:20:19,322 --> 00:20:22,092
work you insisted on displaying
even after he objected.

396
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,156
I'm proud of him.

397
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,727
I'm trying to encourage him.

398
00:20:24,772 --> 00:20:25,866
But what you've done

399
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,038
is made him feel
trapped and powerless.

400
00:20:28,081 --> 00:20:30,988
You've barely spent
one night in this house

401
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:34,329
and you think you can
analyze our entire family?

402
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:37,068
You don't know
your brother anymore, Ezri.

403
00:20:37,108 --> 00:20:40,482
He's a fragile young man
who needs to be cared for.

404
00:20:40,518 --> 00:20:42,923
He is a grown man
who needs his freedom.

405
00:20:43,026 --> 00:20:44,895
You're smothering him.

406
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:47,805
How dare you come in here
and tell me how to be a mother?

407
00:20:47,841 --> 00:20:49,836
What do you know
about raising children?

408
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,083
Actually, I have three...
no, four lifetimes' worth

409
00:20:53,123 --> 00:20:55,322
of memories
about raising children.

410
00:20:55,363 --> 00:20:57,164
I have worked and sacrificed

411
00:20:57,201 --> 00:20:59,572
for each one of you
for over 30 years.

412
00:21:00,745 --> 00:21:01,873
Not now!

413
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:05,324
Sorry to interrupt, but...

414
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:08,297
Miles!

415
00:21:08,335 --> 00:21:09,862
Ezri...

416
00:21:09,907 --> 00:21:11,400
what are you doing here?

417
00:21:11,445 --> 00:21:13,644
This is... my home.
This is where I live.

418
00:21:13,684 --> 00:21:16,351
Uh... my mother.

419
00:21:16,393 --> 00:21:18,730
I'm pleased to meet you,
Mr. O'Brien.

420
00:21:18,766 --> 00:21:19,928
Can you?

421
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:23,207
He wasn't very friendly
when we located him.

422
00:21:23,246 --> 00:21:24,682
Neither were you.

423
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:27,350
If you'll excuse me,
we're having a problem

424
00:21:27,392 --> 00:21:29,124
with a drill down in 24-B.

425
00:21:31,973 --> 00:21:33,238
Did you do this to him?

426
00:21:33,276 --> 00:21:34,837
Just the one on the jaw.

427
00:21:34,882 --> 00:21:37,583
The rest he got thanks
to the Orion Syndicate.

428
00:21:38,692 --> 00:21:40,823
Did you find out anything
on Bilby's wife?

429
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,997
I found her.

430
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,943
She's dead.

431
00:21:50,747 --> 00:21:52,081
Thanks.

432
00:21:54,024 --> 00:21:57,467
The DNA scan confirmed
that the body was Morica's.

433
00:21:57,501 --> 00:22:00,031
She'd been dead
at least six weeks.

434
00:22:00,076 --> 00:22:02,071
Do you have any idea
of the cause of death?

435
00:22:02,115 --> 00:22:03,084
No.

436
00:22:03,118 --> 00:22:05,853
The cause of death
was the Orion Syndicate.

437
00:22:05,892 --> 00:22:07,659
There's no evidence of that.

438
00:22:07,698 --> 00:22:10,365
L-it could have been
an accident.

439
00:22:10,407 --> 00:22:11,603
Oh, yeah.
She accidentally

440
00:22:11,643 --> 00:22:12,839
hit herself in the head

441
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,681
and accidentally threw herself
in the river, huh?

442
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:17,158
We pull a dozen bodies a month
out of that river.

443
00:22:17,193 --> 00:22:18,857
You think
they're all Syndicate murders?

444
00:22:18,898 --> 00:22:20,961
If it was anything like this,
yes.

445
00:22:21,005 --> 00:22:22,441
And if you hadn't interfered

446
00:22:22,476 --> 00:22:25,041
I might have proved
she was murdered.

447
00:22:25,084 --> 00:22:27,888
If we hadn't interfered,
you'd be dead.

448
00:22:27,925 --> 00:22:30,923
When your mother called us,
we already had word

449
00:22:30,968 --> 00:22:33,202
that a Starfleet Intelligence
Operative was trying

450
00:22:33,241 --> 00:22:34,506
to infiltrate the Syndicate.

451
00:22:34,546 --> 00:22:35,948
It didn't take long

452
00:22:35,983 --> 00:22:37,887
to realize
that it was your friend.

453
00:22:37,922 --> 00:22:41,296
We found him being beaten up
by a pair of Nausicaans.

454
00:22:41,332 --> 00:22:43,566
They were just trying
to scare me.

455
00:22:43,606 --> 00:22:44,974
Why?

456
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,310
Exactly.

457
00:22:46,347 --> 00:22:48,342
Why were they trying
to scare me?

458
00:22:48,386 --> 00:22:51,121
Because I had found the body
of Morica Bilby

459
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:53,897
and they didn't want me to trace
the murder back to them.

460
00:22:53,936 --> 00:22:56,569
The Syndicate would never kill
the widow of an operative.

461
00:22:56,612 --> 00:22:58,607
The only thing holding
them together is

462
00:22:58,651 --> 00:22:59,813
this loyalty they show

463
00:22:59,854 --> 00:23:01,621
to operatives
and their families.

464
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,529
They may not be
as loyal as you think.

465
00:23:09,182 --> 00:23:12,886
Mrs. Tigan, please contact
us if there's anything else

466
00:23:12,926 --> 00:23:13,952
we can do for you.

467
00:23:13,996 --> 00:23:15,660
Thank you.
I will.

468
00:23:19,781 --> 00:23:21,081
Ezri, why don't you show
Mr. O'Brien

469
00:23:21,118 --> 00:23:22,087
to one of our guest rooms.

470
00:23:22,121 --> 00:23:24,390
Let him clean up
and have something to eat.

471
00:23:27,203 --> 00:23:28,297
Thanks.

472
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:35,988
...so that tip led me
to the river.

473
00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:38,730
I searched the south bank
for about three hours

474
00:23:38,771 --> 00:23:39,933
before I found her.

475
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:43,317
The organic solvents
in the water

476
00:23:43,351 --> 00:23:45,516
had partially
decomposed her body...

477
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,221
but it was her.

478
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,165
I'm sorry, Chief.

479
00:23:49,202 --> 00:23:51,471
I wish there was
something more I could do.

480
00:23:52,478 --> 00:23:54,382
Maybe you could put in
a good word for me

481
00:23:54,418 --> 00:23:55,512
with Captain Sisko.

482
00:23:55,554 --> 00:23:58,826
It may take a lot of good words,
but I'll talk to him.

483
00:23:58,864 --> 00:24:02,170
Mr. O'Brien,
how are you feeling?

484
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:03,438
Fine, thank you.

485
00:24:03,478 --> 00:24:05,005
I've eaten enough for a week.

486
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:06,109
Glad to hear it.

487
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,352
I understand
that you're an engineer.

488
00:24:08,393 --> 00:24:09,384
That's right.

489
00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:11,230
He's not a mining engineer.

490
00:24:11,302 --> 00:24:13,901
We have a problem
with a transsonic drill

491
00:24:13,943 --> 00:24:16,975
that no one on my staff
seems capable of fixing

492
00:24:17,018 --> 00:24:18,956
and I would appreciate
it very much

493
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:20,986
if you would be kind
enough to take a look at it.

494
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:24,164
Now?
Mother, he needs some rest.

495
00:24:24,207 --> 00:24:26,406
How much rest do you require,
Mr. O'Brien?

496
00:24:26,447 --> 00:24:29,114
Actually, I feel fine.

497
00:24:29,154 --> 00:24:30,852
Thank you.

498
00:24:30,894 --> 00:24:32,056
I'll see you at dinner.

499
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:36,807
I'm sorry about this.

500
00:24:36,845 --> 00:24:38,874
Our mother is a force of nature.

501
00:24:38,918 --> 00:24:40,046
It's all right.

502
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:41,854
It'll be good to get my hands

503
00:24:41,893 --> 00:24:43,591
on a problem I can solve
for a change.

504
00:24:43,631 --> 00:24:45,500
Lead on.

505
00:25:17,232 --> 00:25:19,067
Good morning.

506
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,836
Good afternoon.

507
00:25:21,846 --> 00:25:22,837
Oh.

508
00:25:29,034 --> 00:25:31,804
Mother is not going
to be happy about this.

509
00:25:31,843 --> 00:25:33,245
Don't worry.

510
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,275
You're out of the line
of fire for the moment.

511
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,554
She's too busy
torturing Janel and Miles.

512
00:25:37,593 --> 00:25:39,428
Miles?

513
00:25:39,499 --> 00:25:40,661
Oh, your friend.

514
00:25:40,702 --> 00:25:41,796
They found him?

515
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,968
He's fine.

516
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:45,882
Great.
That's great, Zee.

517
00:25:45,918 --> 00:25:47,411
Does that mean you're leaving?

518
00:25:47,456 --> 00:25:48,686
Not right away.

519
00:25:51,769 --> 00:25:54,368
Let's talk about you.

520
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,853
More specifically,
about what you did last night.

521
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,022
What can I say?

522
00:26:01,063 --> 00:26:03,228
I get drunk,
I become an art critic.

523
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:06,376
Do you regret what you did?

524
00:26:06,413 --> 00:26:08,214
Not really.

525
00:26:08,251 --> 00:26:10,850
I never liked
those pieces anyway.

526
00:26:13,668 --> 00:26:18,080
So, what are you feeling?

527
00:26:18,114 --> 00:26:21,682
I'm feeling like I don't want
to be analyzed by my sister.

528
00:26:21,725 --> 00:26:24,096
Sorry.

529
00:26:24,132 --> 00:26:25,625
It's what I do.

530
00:26:27,543 --> 00:26:31,008
This situation is
not that complex, Zee.

531
00:26:31,053 --> 00:26:34,518
I am wallowing in self-pity

532
00:26:34,597 --> 00:26:37,504
and acting out my frustrations
by throwing tantrums.

533
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:40,274
All right, Dr. Norvo.

534
00:26:40,314 --> 00:26:43,722
If that's your diagnosis,
what's your prescription?

535
00:26:43,758 --> 00:26:47,064
Mother disapproves of suicide...

536
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:48,503
all that blood on the carpets.

537
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:49,873
Not funny.

538
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:52,212
Best I can do with a hangover.

539
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:56,595
Norvo...

540
00:26:56,663 --> 00:26:59,159
what would happen if you
left with me tomorrow?

541
00:26:59,204 --> 00:27:00,538
What do you mean?

542
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:02,342
I mean, what would happen

543
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,409
if you went back
to Deep Space 9 with me?

544
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,020
Mother would go insane.

545
00:27:08,064 --> 00:27:10,036
Forget about her for the moment.

546
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,805
I can't... I can't
just pick up and leave.

547
00:27:14,617 --> 00:27:16,816
Well, it doesn't have
to be a permanent move.

548
00:27:16,857 --> 00:27:20,197
Think of it as a vacation...
a break from all of this

549
00:27:20,234 --> 00:27:21,568
some time to clear your head,
that's all.

550
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:23,600
I... I don't know

551
00:27:23,677 --> 00:27:26,412
if I can leave all of this
on Janel's shoulders.

552
00:27:26,452 --> 00:27:27,945
Janel can handle it.

553
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,324
It's not that simple.

554
00:27:29,361 --> 00:27:32,234
There are some things
going on that are complicated.

555
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:34,469
Like what?

556
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,745
Things with the company.

557
00:27:37,786 --> 00:27:39,655
No offense, Norvo

558
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:42,255
but you're not exactly holding
the company together.

559
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,298
Mother can pay a real accountant
to do the work she's given you.

560
00:27:45,342 --> 00:27:47,838
I don't... I don't know, Zee.

561
00:27:47,883 --> 00:27:49,684
Well, think about it.

562
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:58,645
You're right.
The problem's definitely

563
00:27:58,682 --> 00:28:00,620
in the secondary
input transtator.

564
00:28:00,655 --> 00:28:02,650
But the transtator
checks out perfectly.

565
00:28:02,761 --> 00:28:04,163
I'm sure it does

566
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:06,866
but it's the wrong
transtator for this drill.

567
00:28:06,907 --> 00:28:08,674
What?

568
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:09,975
You need a 52-J.

569
00:28:10,016 --> 00:28:11,680
This is a 52-L.

570
00:28:11,721 --> 00:28:13,556
It says 52-J.

571
00:28:13,593 --> 00:28:16,432
I know,
but it's definitely an "L."

572
00:28:16,468 --> 00:28:19,101
Must have been
accidentally mislabeled.

573
00:28:19,144 --> 00:28:20,945
Or deliberately.

574
00:28:20,982 --> 00:28:23,216
Another equipment failure?

575
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:28,203
Perhaps if you hadn't
dismissed Mr. Lorkin

576
00:28:28,238 --> 00:28:29,468
this wouldn't have happened.

577
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:32,505
He was dismissed
on my mother's personal order.

578
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:35,650
Then we'll have to find a way
of changing her mind, won't we?

579
00:28:38,501 --> 00:28:40,496
Who's your new mechanic, Janel?

580
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,942
This is Mr. O'Brien.

581
00:28:41,978 --> 00:28:44,451
He's a friend of the family.

582
00:28:44,486 --> 00:28:47,484
That wouldn't be Chief O'Brien,
would it?

583
00:28:47,528 --> 00:28:48,793
How did you know that?

584
00:28:48,866 --> 00:28:51,670
I have several friends
in the New Sydney police.

585
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:55,378
I heard they recently rescued
a Starfleet Chief named O'Brien

586
00:28:55,419 --> 00:28:57,220
from an unpleasant situation.

587
00:28:58,294 --> 00:28:59,821
That's me.

588
00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:01,666
I don't believe
I caught your name.

589
00:29:01,704 --> 00:29:03,767
Thadial Bokar.

590
00:29:03,844 --> 00:29:05,782
I'm a commodities broker

591
00:29:05,817 --> 00:29:07,982
attempting to establish
business ties

592
00:29:08,023 --> 00:29:10,553
with the illustrious
Tigan family.

593
00:29:10,597 --> 00:29:12,728
Will you excuse us
for a moment, Chief?

594
00:29:12,771 --> 00:29:16,077
Mr. Bokar and I have
some business to discuss.

595
00:29:16,114 --> 00:29:17,208
Thank you for your help.

596
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,449
I'll have a new transtator
installed right away.

597
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:20,619
Glad to do it.

598
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,978
Sabotaging our drills isn't
going to convince me

599
00:29:30,022 --> 00:29:32,221
to do more business
with the Orion Syndicate.

600
00:29:32,262 --> 00:29:34,097
We'll argue about that later.

601
00:29:34,134 --> 00:29:36,471
We have more immediate concerns.

602
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:38,879
O'Brien is with
Starfleet Intelligence.

603
00:29:38,982 --> 00:29:40,384
No, he isn't.

604
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,654
He works with my sister
on Deep Space 9.

605
00:29:42,693 --> 00:29:44,892
That may be what
he wants you to think

606
00:29:44,967 --> 00:29:46,163
but why was he on New Sydney

607
00:29:46,204 --> 00:29:47,731
trying to infiltrate
the Syndicate?

608
00:29:47,775 --> 00:29:49,838
He was looking for some woman.

609
00:29:49,882 --> 00:29:50,976
"Some woman."

610
00:29:51,988 --> 00:29:53,857
Do you know the name
of this woman?

611
00:29:53,894 --> 00:29:54,863
No.

612
00:29:54,897 --> 00:29:55,888
Well, I do.

613
00:29:55,933 --> 00:29:58,566
Her name was Morica Bilby.

614
00:30:00,246 --> 00:30:01,682
What?

615
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:04,054
Now, of course, I haven't heard
from Morica Bilby

616
00:30:04,091 --> 00:30:05,527
in quite some time.

617
00:30:05,562 --> 00:30:08,936
Rumor has it that she's dead,
but I wouldn't know anything

618
00:30:08,972 --> 00:30:09,963
about that.

619
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:11,979
What I do know
is that Chief O'Brien

620
00:30:12,015 --> 00:30:14,682
should leave this system quickly

621
00:30:14,722 --> 00:30:17,959
before something happens to him.

622
00:30:27,281 --> 00:30:29,652
So, you're not leaving
until tomorrow?

623
00:30:29,688 --> 00:30:30,657
Well, probably.

624
00:30:30,691 --> 00:30:31,717
It really depends on Ezri.

625
00:30:31,761 --> 00:30:33,459
Why?

626
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,027
Well, she's my superior officer.

627
00:30:35,071 --> 00:30:36,439
I go when she goes.

628
00:30:36,476 --> 00:30:41,355
Besides, I'm not looking forward
to seeing Captain Sisko.

629
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:44,124
He has a boot
with my name on it.

630
00:30:44,165 --> 00:30:46,330
This isn't a good time
for guests.

631
00:30:46,371 --> 00:30:47,601
There's a lot of work to do.

632
00:30:47,642 --> 00:30:49,705
The quicker you're on your way,
the better.

633
00:31:01,316 --> 00:31:03,345
Your brother seems eager
to get rid of us.

634
00:31:03,389 --> 00:31:04,859
Oh, don't mind him.

635
00:31:04,893 --> 00:31:06,363
He's been under
a lot of pressure.

636
00:31:08,772 --> 00:31:11,371
Do you know a man
named Thadial Bokar?

637
00:31:11,446 --> 00:31:13,942
Says he's a commodities broker.

638
00:31:13,987 --> 00:31:15,822
No.

639
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,356
But I make it a point
to know as little as possible

640
00:31:18,401 --> 00:31:20,236
about the family business.

641
00:31:20,273 --> 00:31:21,903
Why?

642
00:31:21,944 --> 00:31:25,113
Well, he came to the mine
to talk with Janel

643
00:31:25,155 --> 00:31:26,625
while I was working
on the drill.

644
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:29,566
There was something about him
reminded me of when I was

645
00:31:29,601 --> 00:31:31,800
working undercover
with the Orion Syndicate...

646
00:31:31,841 --> 00:31:33,243
you know,
something about the way

647
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,183
they dealt with civilians.

648
00:31:35,218 --> 00:31:38,193
You think this Mr. Bokar
is a member of the Syndicate?

649
00:31:38,227 --> 00:31:40,290
It's just a feeling...

650
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:43,206
and a pretty strong feeling.

651
00:31:43,242 --> 00:31:44,837
We should tell Janel.

652
00:31:46,318 --> 00:31:47,686
I think Janel already knows.

653
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,324
Well, I know
I'm not offering you

654
00:31:51,366 --> 00:31:52,494
any hard evidence here,
Lieutenant

655
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:55,169
but your brother seems
like a man

656
00:31:55,211 --> 00:31:57,012
who's being pressured
by the Syndicate.

657
00:31:57,049 --> 00:32:01,084
He's experiencing
sudden equipment breakdowns

658
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:04,366
work stoppages,
mysterious accidents.

659
00:32:05,709 --> 00:32:06,939
That's the way the Syndicate

660
00:32:06,979 --> 00:32:08,780
extorts money
from legitimate companies.

661
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:11,726
"Do business with us
or we'll ruin you."

662
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:15,698
Janel is not someone
who's easily intimidated

663
00:32:15,739 --> 00:32:18,440
and my mother... she would burn
this place to the ground

664
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,611
before she did business
with the Syndicate.

665
00:32:20,654 --> 00:32:22,785
Well, there's one way
to find out.

666
00:32:22,827 --> 00:32:26,235
Do you have access to
the company's financial records?

667
00:32:31,821 --> 00:32:34,853
What would you do
on Deep Space 9?

668
00:32:34,897 --> 00:32:36,869
Take a vacation.

669
00:32:36,903 --> 00:32:38,464
Clear my head.

670
00:32:38,507 --> 00:32:39,567
Clear your head of what?

671
00:32:39,644 --> 00:32:41,342
I-I don't know.

672
00:32:41,383 --> 00:32:43,184
Then why do you need
a vacation?

673
00:32:43,222 --> 00:32:44,556
I guess I don't, really.

674
00:32:44,592 --> 00:32:47,590
I just... but it would be nice
to spend some time with Ezri.

675
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:49,833
You're spending time
with her right now, aren't you?

676
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:51,243
Yes...

677
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,809
We're ready to open 25 Beta.

678
00:32:53,853 --> 00:32:55,221
I'll be right there.

679
00:32:55,258 --> 00:32:58,324
Norvo, this is a very bad time
for you to take a vacation.

680
00:32:58,367 --> 00:32:59,632
We have far too much work to do.

681
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,642
Have you finished the review?

682
00:33:01,676 --> 00:33:02,576
Almost.

683
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:04,081
Well, then maybe
you should get to it.

684
00:33:05,087 --> 00:33:06,078
Yes, ma'am.

685
00:33:12,108 --> 00:33:13,099
Let's go.

686
00:33:17,657 --> 00:33:20,530
Now I remember why I never went
into the family business...

687
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:22,971
all these contracts and invoices

688
00:33:23,007 --> 00:33:25,070
balance sheets
and shipping orders.

689
00:33:25,113 --> 00:33:25,739
Oh...

690
00:33:25,783 --> 00:33:27,413
I feel like I'm trapped

691
00:33:27,454 --> 00:33:28,582
in some kind
of Ferengi nightmare.

692
00:33:29,895 --> 00:33:31,365
What?

693
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,311
What is it?

694
00:33:38,353 --> 00:33:39,549
I don't know.

695
00:33:41,296 --> 00:33:42,390
What's going on here?

696
00:33:42,432 --> 00:33:44,404
What do you mean?

697
00:33:44,438 --> 00:33:46,376
Did you come here to find me

698
00:33:46,411 --> 00:33:49,010
or to prevent me
finding out the truth?

699
00:33:50,255 --> 00:33:52,056
I don't know
what you're talking about

700
00:33:52,094 --> 00:33:54,066
so maybe
you should just tell me, Chief.

701
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,334
The connection between
the Orion Syndicate

702
00:33:56,374 --> 00:33:57,674
and your family...

703
00:33:57,711 --> 00:33:59,740
is Morica Bilby.

704
00:33:59,783 --> 00:34:02,781
She was on the company's
payroll when she died.

705
00:34:03,795 --> 00:34:05,459
Did you know about this?

706
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:08,476
No. Of course not.

707
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,573
Well, someone
in your family did.

708
00:34:11,586 --> 00:34:12,886
And since they didn't mention it

709
00:34:12,924 --> 00:34:14,394
they obviously
don't want us to know.

710
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:16,332
Are you suggesting?

711
00:34:16,367 --> 00:34:18,339
I'm not suggesting anything

712
00:34:18,373 --> 00:34:20,572
but you have to face
the possibility

713
00:34:20,613 --> 00:34:22,608
that somebody in your family...

714
00:34:22,652 --> 00:34:24,647
was involved in her death.

715
00:34:30,342 --> 00:34:31,311
There.

716
00:34:31,345 --> 00:34:32,713
Nine months ago.

717
00:34:32,749 --> 00:34:35,245
Morica Bilby shows up
on the payroll

718
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,091
as a shipping consultant.

719
00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:39,968
Five bars of latinum
a week for services rendered.

720
00:34:40,005 --> 00:34:42,068
What services?

721
00:34:42,111 --> 00:34:44,584
There's no cross-reference.

722
00:34:44,618 --> 00:34:47,251
No indication of what she
was doing for the company.

723
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,025
Whatever it was, she must
have been good at the job.

724
00:34:49,065 --> 00:34:50,227
Look here.

725
00:34:50,268 --> 00:34:52,764
Her salary increases
to ten bars a week

726
00:34:52,809 --> 00:34:54,370
then 20, then 30.

727
00:34:54,414 --> 00:34:57,754
The last payment entry
was six weeks ago.

728
00:34:58,894 --> 00:35:01,128
The day before she was killed.

729
00:35:05,848 --> 00:35:07,512
Who's in charge of the payroll?

730
00:35:10,261 --> 00:35:13,100
My mother... ultimately,
but she's turned over

731
00:35:13,137 --> 00:35:15,770
most of the day-to-day
operations to Janel

732
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:18,980
and Norvo's been doing
the bookkeeping.

733
00:35:19,021 --> 00:35:22,464
Any one of them could know
about Morica's payments.

734
00:35:23,935 --> 00:35:25,303
Or all of them.

735
00:35:27,547 --> 00:35:29,108
Lieutenant, we have to show this

736
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,645
to the authorities
on New Sydney.

737
00:35:32,094 --> 00:35:33,530
Not yet.

738
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:35,537
Not until I find out
what's happened.

739
00:35:37,476 --> 00:35:39,243
That's an order.

740
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:42,649
Yes, sir.

741
00:35:49,713 --> 00:35:52,346
Why was this woman
on our payroll?

742
00:35:52,387 --> 00:35:55,191
We were returning a favor.

743
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,199
To whom?

744
00:35:56,233 --> 00:35:57,931
To the Orion Syndicate.

745
00:35:57,971 --> 00:36:00,912
And what "favor"
did they do for us?

746
00:36:03,655 --> 00:36:06,425
Remember when the Ferengi
opened up the Timor II mine

747
00:36:06,463 --> 00:36:08,766
and there was a ten point drop
in the price of pergium?

748
00:36:08,803 --> 00:36:11,242
Well, that came
at a bad moment.

749
00:36:11,278 --> 00:36:13,045
We were overextended
on some loans

750
00:36:13,082 --> 00:36:14,814
our cash reserves were depleted

751
00:36:14,855 --> 00:36:17,385
and a Jem'Hadar raid
destroyed an entire shipment

752
00:36:17,429 --> 00:36:19,925
before it reached the refinery
on Rigel IV.

753
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,600
So you turned to the Syndicate?

754
00:36:21,642 --> 00:36:23,169
They came to me.

755
00:36:23,213 --> 00:36:25,812
They offered us a way out
and I took it.

756
00:36:25,854 --> 00:36:27,621
I did what I had to do.

757
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,464
And I don't remember
you asking a lot of questions

758
00:36:30,501 --> 00:36:32,804
when our cash problems
were resolved overnight.

759
00:36:32,842 --> 00:36:34,905
Because I trusted you.

760
00:36:34,948 --> 00:36:36,543
Obviously, it was a mistake.

761
00:36:37,556 --> 00:36:38,992
What about Morica?

762
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:42,661
About a month after
Bokar arranged the loan

763
00:36:42,705 --> 00:36:45,270
he came to me and said
it was time to return the favor.

764
00:36:45,313 --> 00:36:47,182
There was a woman
who needed a job

765
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:48,415
with a salary

766
00:36:48,455 --> 00:36:50,758
but without
any actual work involved.

767
00:36:50,796 --> 00:36:53,292
He said she was the widow
of one of their associates

768
00:36:53,337 --> 00:36:55,742
and they needed
to take care of her.

769
00:36:55,778 --> 00:37:00,087
I didn't feel like
I was in a position to say no

770
00:37:00,123 --> 00:37:03,897
so I started
making the payments.

771
00:37:03,935 --> 00:37:07,400
No one would have been the wiser
if Norvo had altered

772
00:37:07,446 --> 00:37:10,045
the payroll records
like I asked him.

773
00:37:10,153 --> 00:37:12,524
You dragged your little brother
into this?

774
00:37:12,561 --> 00:37:13,689
You're the one who says

775
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,966
there's nothing more important
than the company.

776
00:37:16,004 --> 00:37:17,599
Well, that's all
I was thinking about...

777
00:37:17,642 --> 00:37:18,872
the company.

778
00:37:18,913 --> 00:37:21,078
You dumped it in my lap
and I saved it

779
00:37:21,153 --> 00:37:23,091
so don't start complaining now.

780
00:37:23,192 --> 00:37:25,027
If it weren't for me,
we would have been finished.

781
00:37:25,065 --> 00:37:27,196
Don't you rationalize
what you've done.

782
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:28,230
All right, all right.

783
00:37:28,275 --> 00:37:31,045
We can talk
about who saved what later.

784
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,850
Right now,
we have to concentrate

785
00:37:32,889 --> 00:37:34,416
on what happened to Morica.

786
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,862
The payroll records show

787
00:37:35,898 --> 00:37:37,893
a steady increase
in her payments.

788
00:37:37,937 --> 00:37:38,997
Why?

789
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,479
She wasn't happy
with her salary.

790
00:37:41,514 --> 00:37:44,614
She said the Syndicate promised
her a comfortable living

791
00:37:44,657 --> 00:37:47,632
and she wasn't comfortable
on what we were paying her.

792
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:49,797
How did she die?

793
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,074
I don't know.

794
00:37:52,112 --> 00:37:57,390
Janel... if you have anything
to do with this

795
00:37:57,429 --> 00:37:59,333
now is the time to speak.

796
00:37:59,368 --> 00:38:01,363
What are you saying?

797
00:38:01,407 --> 00:38:03,002
That I had her killed?

798
00:38:03,045 --> 00:38:04,241
I'm asking.

799
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,684
Mother, he wouldn't
have killed her.

800
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,814
You stay out of this.

801
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,156
Listen to me.

802
00:38:10,233 --> 00:38:13,367
I will get you the very best
solicitor in New Sydney

803
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:14,713
but you must tell me the truth.

804
00:38:15,715 --> 00:38:17,653
I didn't kill her.

805
00:38:17,687 --> 00:38:19,682
Oh, Janel,
why don't I believe you?

806
00:38:19,727 --> 00:38:21,288
Why don't I believe
that this woman

807
00:38:21,331 --> 00:38:23,861
just happened to die
at the exact moment

808
00:38:23,907 --> 00:38:25,537
she was pressuring you
for more money?

809
00:38:25,611 --> 00:38:27,138
Why won't you listen to him?

810
00:38:27,183 --> 00:38:28,483
He didn't do it.

811
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:32,224
I may not have shed any tears
when I found out she was dead

812
00:38:32,264 --> 00:38:33,666
but I didn't kill her.

813
00:38:33,702 --> 00:38:34,431
Then who did?

814
00:38:34,471 --> 00:38:35,941
The police said...

815
00:38:35,976 --> 00:38:40,285
Norvo, you don't know what
happened to Morica, do you?

816
00:38:40,322 --> 00:38:43,456
Even if it was an accident,
we are going to hire...

817
00:38:43,498 --> 00:38:45,697
I'm the idiot brother.

818
00:38:45,738 --> 00:38:47,607
How would I know?

819
00:38:47,644 --> 00:38:51,212
Tell me you don't know
anything about this.

820
00:38:55,568 --> 00:38:57,095
I tried to reason with her

821
00:38:57,139 --> 00:39:00,239
but she was very angry...

822
00:39:00,282 --> 00:39:02,687
angry at the Syndicate,
angry at us

823
00:39:02,722 --> 00:39:05,025
even angry at her husband
for getting himself killed.

824
00:39:09,843 --> 00:39:12,316
I didn't go there
to kill her, see?

825
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:14,049
I really didn't

826
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:16,620
but she wouldn't listen to me.

827
00:39:16,698 --> 00:39:18,191
She started yelling.

828
00:39:18,235 --> 00:39:21,472
Said that our family was
just as bad as the Syndicate

829
00:39:21,512 --> 00:39:25,320
that we were all liars
and cheats.

830
00:39:25,357 --> 00:39:28,697
And then, suddenly I realized
that if she were dead...

831
00:39:31,876 --> 00:39:34,041
all of our problems
would go away.

832
00:39:40,168 --> 00:39:41,729
Oh, Norvo.

833
00:39:54,277 --> 00:39:56,682
I took care of it.

834
00:39:56,717 --> 00:39:59,088
You always said that I was

835
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:02,795
too weak...
to handle the tough ones.

836
00:40:05,008 --> 00:40:06,102
I'm not.

837
00:40:06,146 --> 00:40:08,380
I proved it.

838
00:40:08,419 --> 00:40:10,790
I handled a problem
that you couldn't.

839
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:13,824
I handled it.

840
00:40:34,062 --> 00:40:36,034
I need to, uh...

841
00:40:36,068 --> 00:40:40,343
inspect the ore
samples from 53-C.

842
00:40:40,381 --> 00:40:47,095
We have to make a decision
on whether to open up a new...

843
00:40:47,135 --> 00:40:50,042
Janel, forget about the mine.

844
00:40:50,077 --> 00:40:52,106
It doesn't matter.

845
00:40:54,624 --> 00:40:57,497
I want you to listen to me.

846
00:40:57,532 --> 00:41:01,202
After Norvo's trial is over,
you need to go.

847
00:41:01,244 --> 00:41:03,045
Go where?

848
00:41:03,082 --> 00:41:04,883
It doesn't matter.
Just go.

849
00:41:04,955 --> 00:41:07,428
Find another life for yourself.

850
00:41:07,462 --> 00:41:09,901
Trust me.

851
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,668
You'll be happier.

852
00:41:32,604 --> 00:41:34,838
They've taken Norvo.

853
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,199
I'm going to stay on New Sydney
for the trial

854
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:45,003
and then I'm going
to head back to Deep Space 9.

855
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:56,467
This isn't my fault,
is it, Ezri?

856
00:41:59,585 --> 00:42:02,925
I didn't do this, did I?

857
00:42:31,748 --> 00:42:33,743
Mind if I join you?

858
00:42:38,602 --> 00:42:40,095
When did you get back?

859
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,166
Last night.

860
00:42:43,383 --> 00:42:45,686
Norvo was sentenced
to 30 years.

861
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:51,806
I wish I could say
I was sorry, but...

862
00:42:51,841 --> 00:42:55,010
considering what he did,
he got off easy.

863
00:42:57,358 --> 00:42:59,991
I understand
why you feel that way

864
00:43:00,033 --> 00:43:03,407
but you didn't know him, Miles.

865
00:43:03,443 --> 00:43:06,817
Norvo was very gifted.

866
00:43:06,853 --> 00:43:09,452
When we were young,
he had so much potential.

867
00:43:09,495 --> 00:43:10,589
Norvo was always the one

868
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:14,507
that we all thought
would be something special

869
00:43:14,543 --> 00:43:17,073
and I don't know what happened.

870
00:43:17,117 --> 00:43:20,149
I don't know
how my brother turned into...

871
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:25,170
You know, I guess
I just spent so many years

872
00:43:25,241 --> 00:43:26,973
dreaming of ways
to get out of that house

873
00:43:27,014 --> 00:43:30,616
that I didn't see
what was really going on inside

874
00:43:30,658 --> 00:43:33,690
what was happening to Norvo...

875
00:43:33,734 --> 00:43:36,504
the endless humiliation

876
00:43:36,542 --> 00:43:39,608
the constant drumbeat
of criticism...

877
00:43:41,791 --> 00:43:44,732
the way his heart was carved up
into little pieces.

878
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:48,232
I should have seen it.

879
00:43:48,277 --> 00:43:50,009
I should have tried
to stop it.

880
00:43:50,049 --> 00:43:52,579
You can't blame yourself.

881
00:43:52,624 --> 00:43:54,995
You're not responsible for that.

882
00:43:55,031 --> 00:43:57,230
But I am, don't you see?

883
00:43:58,875 --> 00:44:02,009
I should have gone home
a long time ago.
