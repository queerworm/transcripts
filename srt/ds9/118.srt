1
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:07,883
(<i> door chimes</i> )

2
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:09,176
Come in.

3
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,014
Commander,
I just received word

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,642
that a Valerian transport
has requested permission

5
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,602
to dock here at the station.

6
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,395
Let me guess.

7
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,857
You're here to recommend
that we deny that request.

8
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,817
The Valerians ran
weapons-grade dolamide

9
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:27,361
to Cardassian forces
during the occupation of Bajor.

10
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,863
I'm aware of that.

11
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:30,865
I believe
they're continuing

12
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:33,116
to ship weapons
to the Cardassians--

13
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,536
weapons that could eventually
be used to attack Bajor.

14
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,872
I share your concern, Major,
but unless we have proof

15
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:39,080
to back up those charges...

16
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,916
The proof is on that ship.

17
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,626
Let me conduct a search

18
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:44,753
and if I find any dolamide,
we can confiscate it.

19
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,296
I'm afraid it's
not that simple.

20
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,798
Dolamide is used
for power generators

21
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,217
reactors and short-range
transports.

22
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,510
And for weapons.

23
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,846
Only if it's
extremely pure.

24
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:56,724
So we're going
to do nothing?

25
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:58,058
I didn't say that.

26
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,768
We just can't
board their ship

27
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,520
and start
tearing it apart.

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,980
Well, what can we do?

29
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,650
You bring me evidence
that the Valerians

30
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,485
are dealing in weapons-
grade dolamide

31
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,362
and I promise you that
the Federation will use

32
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:12,489
every kind of diplomatic
pressure to stop them.

33
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,115
You really think that'll work?

34
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,701
It will if the Valerians

35
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,244
want to continue trading
with the Federation.

36
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,330
All right.

37
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,583
We'll try it your way.

38
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,125
Good.

39
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,753
Then you will see to it

40
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:28,005
that the Valerian ship
is cleared for docking.

41
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,011
Yes, sir.

42
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:38,515
Chief, I have a subspace message
for you from your wife.

43
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,225
They've arrived
safely on Bajor.

44
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,645
Imagine taking
11 bored school kids on a visit

45
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,856
to the grain-processing center
at Lasuma.

46
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,190
I'm glad it's not me.

47
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,902
Major.

48
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,653
Here's the information
you requested

49
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,697
on the Captain
of the Valerian ship.

50
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,866
Let me know if you
find anything else.

51
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:59,119
DAX:
Sensors are reading elevated
neutrino levels at the wormhole.

52
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,496
Something's coming through.

53
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,415
On screen.

54
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,756
Kira to Sisko.
You better come out here.

55
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:15,385
DAX:
It's the Klingon
Vessel<i> Toh'Kaht.</i>

56
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,680
KIRA:
They weren't due back
for another month.

57
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,766
Open hailing frequencies.

58
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,687
(<i> console beeping</i> )

59
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,856
I'm reading
a transporter signal.

60
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,025
Somebody must have beamed off
the ship just as it exploded.

61
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,155
Mr. O'Brien?

62
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:40,535
Something's interfering with
the rematerialization process.

63
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,122
DAX:
Lock onto him
with our transporter signal.

64
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:44,748
Try boosting
the annular containment field.

65
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,207
I'm already there.

66
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:52,297
(<i> gasping</i> )

67
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,470
He's been hit
by weapons fire.

68
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,972
It's severe.

69
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:01,556
We've got to get him
to cryostasis.

70
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,227
Victory.

71
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,564
(<i> groans</i> )

72
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,816
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

73
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:11,733
(<i> steady tone</i> )

74
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,902
He's dead.

75
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:21,696
SISKO:
<i>Station Log, Stardate 46922.3.</i>

76
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,074
<i>We have identified</i>
<i>the dead Klingon.</i>

77
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:27,410
<i>His name was Hon'Tihl,</i>
<i>First Officer of theToh'Kaht.</i>

78
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,455
<i>Why he died, and the cause</i>
<i>of the ship's destruction</i>

79
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,499
<i>is still unknown.</i>

80
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,542
I found
tritanium alloy fragments

81
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,211
in his chest and upper arms.

82
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,879
If that were all,
we could have saved him

83
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,965
but those weapon burns
were too severe.

84
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,300
Is there any way
to identify

85
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,093
the kind
of weapon used?

86
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,012
I'm running a microtissue
analysis right now.

87
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,096
I should have the results
in a couple of hours.

88
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,514
The Klingon said

89
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,765
"victory" just
before he died.

90
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,184
I wonder what he meant.

91
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:51,810
According to
Klingon High Command

92
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,478
the<i> Toh'Kaht</i> was
in the Gamma Quadrant

93
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,896
on a routine
bio-survey mission.

94
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,274
"Victory" during
a bio-survey?

95
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,902
As I recall, the<i> Toh'Kaht</i> put in
for a maintenance check.

96
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,696
Ask around the station

97
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,782
and see what you can learn
about this bio-survey.

98
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,660
Dax and O'Brien, I'd like the
two of you to take a runabout

99
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,829
and try to find the<i> Toh'Kaht's</i>
mission recorder.

100
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,081
I want to know what caused
that ship to explode.

101
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,624
Aye, sir.

102
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,967
Lieutenant?

103
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,302
Yes?

104
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:26,720
You coming?

105
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,013
Yes.

106
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,430
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,390
(<i> laughing</i> ):
Never mind.

108
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,948
(<i> console beeping</i> )

109
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,242
Damn it, not yet.

110
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,705
Deep Space 9, this is
Valerian Vessel<i> Sherval Das.</i>

111
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,874
We are entering
the Bajoran system.

112
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,709
Clear us for docking.

113
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,169
Negative,<i> Sherval Das.</i>

114
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,546
There's going to be
a slight delay.

115
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,590
We are in need of maintenance.

116
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,424
It's been a long journey.

117
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:08,803
Oh, I'm sure it has,
but we have our own problems.

118
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,265
You'll just have to wait.

119
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:14,393
Stand by,<i> Sherval Das.</i>

120
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,186
I'd like an explanation.

121
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,646
I wasn't finished running
a background check

122
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,065
on their ship.

123
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,649
We agreed there
would be no delays

124
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,318
in the docking procedure.

125
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,862
They just visited
Fahleena III and Mariah IV--

126
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,614
the same two stops
they used to make

127
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,325
when they were running
dolamide to the Cardassians.

128
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,994
The last stop would be
the purification plant

129
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,413
at Ultima Thule.

130
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,123
Now, if I can place them there

131
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,625
then we know they're running
weapons-grade material.

132
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,630
SISKO:
Your ship has been
cleared for docking.

133
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,923
Thank you, Commander.

134
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,633
<i>Sherval Das</i> out.

135
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,011
No delays.

136
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,893
ODO:
So, Quark

137
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,021
I heard you had some
problems with the Klingons

138
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,190
the last time
they came through.

139
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,818
Spare me from beings
who think pain is pleasure.

140
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:11,532
In small doses, perhaps,
but the Klingons

141
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,160
oh, they're hard
on the holosuites.

142
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,786
They wreck the furniture.

143
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,664
I'm still fixing the
walls of Holosuite 6.

144
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,583
I'm not saying
they don't spend big.

145
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,295
I'm just saying, by the time
you figure in the damage

146
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,297
I'm lucky to break even.

147
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:28,800
They do tend toward
bluster, don't they?

148
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,261
Throwing their weight
around, bragging...

149
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,596
This crew was worse
than the last.

150
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,556
A glorious mission!

151
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,142
I said, "What's so glorious

152
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,478
about a Gamma Quadrant
bio-survey?"

153
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:44,274
And, uh... what did they say?

154
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,326
Crafty tonight, Odo,
aren't we?

155
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,995
Looking for clues about
the fate of the Klingons?

156
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,291
If I tell you what I heard...

157
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,460
what do I get in return?

158
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,879
The chances are
what you heard won't help

159
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,048
so why should I give you
something for it?

160
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:12,969
Because otherwise,
I heard nothing.

161
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,888
That damaged holosuite--

162
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:18,475
work crew seven
is probably doing the repairs.

163
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,851
Am I right?

164
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,603
Uh-huh.

165
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,606
Well, it looks as though
I might have to put in

166
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,942
a priority request
for work crew seven.

167
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,403
The bulkheads in security

168
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,196
could use
a little shoring up.

169
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,077
They said...

170
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,288
they'd be coming back
through the wormhole

171
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,874
with something

172
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:47,295
that would make the enemies
of the Klingon Empire tremble.

173
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,172
Their exact words?

174
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,258
Direct quote.

175
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,676
You've been most helpful.

176
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,181
Don't let it get around.

177
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,851
(<i> shrieking</i> )

178
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,020
(<i> choking</i> )

179
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,480
(<i> screaming</i> )

180
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,856
Odo?

181
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,452
Dr. Bashir!

182
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:20,036
Dr. Bashir!

183
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,371
Dr. Bashir!

184
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,603
(<i> gasps</i> )

185
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,897
Welcome back, Constable.

186
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,233
How am I?

187
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,319
How do you feel?

188
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,446
Fine.

189
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:57,115
Good, because I have
no way to know.

190
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,242
Your body chemistry
defies analysis.

191
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,713
I don't remember anything

192
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:15,883
but I'm back to normal?

193
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,594
Well, like I said,
you tell me.

194
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,387
I don't know
what caused it

195
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,389
and I couldn't tell you
if it'll happen again.

196
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,100
In fact, there's really
nothing more I can do here.

197
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,312
Then thank you
for your time, Doctor.

198
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,859
Tell me, Odo.

199
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:37,947
Do you share my concern
over this Valerian situation?

200
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,698
Concern?

201
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,618
I think you know what I mean.

202
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,495
Why don't you tell me.

203
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,830
Then you can be sure I know.

204
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,415
Just don't be surprised

205
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,460
if the uneasy alliance
on this station

206
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,087
starts to show a few cracks.

207
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:56,090
What uneasy alliance?

208
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,302
Commander Sisko and Kira.

209
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:03,598
Mark my words,
there's going to be trouble.

210
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:12,440
What exactly are you basing
all this on, Doctor?

211
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:18,196
Very clever, Constable.

212
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,615
But you're probably right.

213
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:24,452
It's a little too early
to commit oneself either way.

214
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,163
Are you finished with me?

215
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,915
Well, unless you'd like
to pour yourself

216
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,250
through my phoretic analyzer.

217
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,459
I'd love to see the results.

218
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,545
Another time, perhaps.

219
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,391
I've got them.

220
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,976
Who?

221
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,811
The Valerians.

222
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,814
Their ship was at the Ultima
Thule station one week ago.

223
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,191
That confirms it.

224
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,610
They're definitely
running dolamide.

225
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,944
So?

226
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,613
So I've got an armed team

227
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,740
ready to board their vessel.

228
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,450
Confiscate the material

229
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,993
and send them back
where they came from.

230
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,996
Frankly, I'm half-tempted
to take them to Bajor

231
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,373
and press charges.

232
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,626
By whose authority?

233
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:18,131
You're not going to do
anything about this.

234
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,258
I'm not...

235
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,721
and neither are you.

236
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:30,602
That ship is acting
against Bajoran interests.

237
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:35,315
This station
is Bajoran property.

238
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:39,235
Commanded
by a Federation officer.

239
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,529
Commanded by me.

240
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,073
Are you challenging that,
Major?

241
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,037
No, sir.

242
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,958
Good.

243
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,423
Short-range sensors
are picking up some debris.

244
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:03,134
Looks like
duranium alloy.

245
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:07,388
Probably pieces of the
Klingon secondary hull.

246
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,474
It's possible
their mission recorder

247
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,058
is somewhere in the debris.

248
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,851
The magnetic field
from the duranium

249
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,771
could be masking it.

250
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,773
Let's get a little closer.

251
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:22,195
Major Kira's become
awfully aggressive

252
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:26,240
toward Commander Sisko
lately about station policy.

253
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,076
An honest
difference of opinion.

254
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,538
What if it's more
than a difference of opinion?

255
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:35,375
What if Kira thinks the Bajorans
don't need us on DS9?

256
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,001
It is their station.

257
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,961
That would be suicidal.

258
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,464
Without a Federation presence,
Bajor would be vulnerable

259
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,383
again
to the Cardassians.

260
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,009
Well, that doesn't mean

261
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,469
there aren't plenty
of misguided Bajorans

262
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,304
who think they
can go it alone.

263
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:56,437
You've become quite friendly
with Major Kira, haven't you?

264
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,148
Have I?

265
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,819
Well, yes, I suppose I have,
if you say so.

266
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,571
Well, I wouldn't get

267
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,113
too friendly with the natives,
if I were you.

268
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,241
Remember
where your loyalties lie.

269
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,909
Of course.

270
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,413
Benjamin and I have been close
for a long time.

271
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,955
Hand and glove.

272
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,458
I'm on his side--
no question about it.

273
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,419
That reminds me

274
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,088
of the time we found...
Good.

275
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,550
Anyone who's against Sisko
is against me.

276
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,428
(<i> console beeping</i> )

277
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,221
I'm picking up

278
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,724
a weak subspace
transponder signal.

279
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,559
It's the mission recorder.

280
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,571
Constable.

281
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,656
Can I help
you, Major?

282
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,659
Oh, you always manage
to help me, Odo.

283
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:56,247
In fact, I think we work
pretty well together

284
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,332
you and I.

285
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,711
Yes, I suppose
our relationship

286
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,838
has always been...
cooperative.

287
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:05,757
Exactly.

288
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:09,009
And that's just what
I need right now--

289
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,763
your cooperation.

290
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:16,058
I'm convinced the Valerians
have dolamide on board

291
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:19,395
but the evidence is
still circumstantial.

292
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,440
I need solid proof.

293
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,902
I want you to slip

294
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,446
past their
security systems

295
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,990
and into their
cargo bay.

296
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,701
I heard that Commander Sisko
was adamant

297
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,704
about<i> not</i> interfering
with the Valerian ship.

298
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,498
Has he changed his mind?

299
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,666
Yes.

300
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,626
How odd.

301
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,590
Very well.

302
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:51,051
I'll keep the two of you
informed about my progress.

303
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,179
That won't
be necessary.

304
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,264
Commander Sisko's very busy.

305
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,016
No sense in disturbing him.

306
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:08,486
I can't fool you, Odo.

307
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:14,074
You wanted me to go
behind Sisko's back, didn't you?

308
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,746
Forget it.

309
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,707
Bad idea.

310
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,840
What if you had
to choose sides?

311
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:34,637
Just remember who
your friends are.

312
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,529
<i>Personal Log, Miles O'Brien.</i>
<i>Stardate 46923.1.</i>

313
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,364
<i>We've managed to retrieve</i>

314
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:55,491

<i>the Klingon officer's journal.</i>

315
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,660
<i>Of course, Major Kira</i>
<i>heard about it immediately.</i>

316
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,746
<i>She must have spies everywhere.</i>

317
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,164
(<i> static</i> ):
I believe the Captain
has gone insane.

318
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,792
He executed
two more crew members...

319
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,045
(<i> garbled</i> )

320
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:10,130
...medical officer...

321
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,925
...violence

322
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,385
is being created by those...

323
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:17,179
energy spheres we brought back
from Saltah'na.

324
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,934
Believing him
to be the Captain's spy

325
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,310
I slit...

326
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,812
I've seen enough.

327
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,272
There's more.

328
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,274
Klingons' mission
must have failed.

329
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,068
That failure caused
problems on board.

330
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:33,279
I couldn't care less
what happened to a Klingon ship.

331
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,198
O'BRIEN:
Well, the Klingons
might want to know.

332
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,158
Dax and I have set up
a data interpolation

333
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,452
to fill in
what's missing.

334
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,578
It might take some time.

335
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,246
SISKO:
If you have to.

336
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,832
The search itself
is often reward enough.

337
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,209
Benjamin, do you
remember that...

338
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,503
Fine.
Do whatever you have to do.

339
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,422
Don't bother me with it.

340
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,479
Ah...

341
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,355
Here we are.

342
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,441
A Modela aperitif.

343
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:13,027
It's bright and sweet.

344
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,862
Much like yourself,
Lieutenant.

345
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,990
I'll put it
on your tab.

346
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,241
The bad flattery's
on the house.

347
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,953
The two loveliest
creatures on DS9.

348
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:24,789
I must be living correctly
to be so...

349
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,582
so blessed.

350
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,876
What can I do for you, Major?

351
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,295
Get lost.

352
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,009
As you wish.

353
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:45,267
How are you, Lieutenant?

354
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,645
You know what they say--

355
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:51,107
put the shoe
on the right foot first

356
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:54,610
but put the left foot first
into the bathtub.

357
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,156
I understand.

358
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:02,242
But what I really
meant was...

359
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,620
are you happy?

360
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,248
That's not a question
I get asked very often.

361
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,250
Oh, but it should be.

362
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,086
In my opinion

363
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:15,506
you are the most valuable
officer on this station.

364
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,133
May I?

365
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,634
Please.

366
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,142
Not bad.

367
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,935
For Quark.

368
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,645
It<i> is</i> good.

369
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:36,276
I couldn't imagine running
this station without you.

370
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:39,906
Are you trying
to tell me something?

371
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,615
(<i> sighing</i> )

372
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,409
My disagreement
with Sisko

373
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,786
over the Valerians
is no secret.

374
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:49,456
Well, you know how he gets
once he's made a decision.

375
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,626
Yeah, it's
like talking to a stone.

376
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:56,338
I remember a time...
on Rochani III

377
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,175
we were cornered
by a party of Kaleans

378
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,511
who were not very happy
to see us, but Benjamin...

379
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,431
Y-You told me this
story this morning.

380
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,391
Oh.

381
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,103
I suppose I did.

382
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,524
If you were to talk
to Starfleet Command

383
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,318
tell them how displeased
the Bajorans are

384
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,487
with Sisko's handling of this.

385
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:23,157
I know they'll listen to you.

386
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:27,828
I was decorated
on my very first mission.

387
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,164
The Admiral was a Vulcan.

388
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:33,292
So during
the presentation ceremony...

389
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,044
Dax.

390
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,463
We have to keep
the Valerians here

391
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:41,175
until we can search the ship
and confiscate the dolamide.

392
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,469
You've got to convince
Starfleet.

393
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:47,681
It's for the good of Bajor...
and the Federation.

394
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:52,103
I've been friends
with Benjamin Sisko

395
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:55,481
for... many years.

396
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:59,610
In many ways,
he's like a son...

397
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,155
or a nephew.

398
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:05,699
Some kind of close relative,
anyway.

399
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,119
Jadzia, listen to me.

400
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:12,706
I'm getting rid of Sisko,
one way or the other.

401
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:17,336
Don't force me to get
rid of you as well.

402
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,339
(<i> crashing</i> )

403
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:30,266
Would you like to join us?

404
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:32,018
(<i> gasping</i> ):
Let me go!

405
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:34,020
What did you hear?

406
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,313
Nothing.

407
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:36,814
Nothing at all.

408
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,570
Good.

409
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,416
(<i> door opening</i> )

410
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:00,921
(<i> groaning</i> )

411
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:04,300
Is this a Ferengi fashion
I'm not aware of?

412
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:09,222
Kira tried to tear
my head off.

413
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:11,224
(<i> groaning</i> )

414
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:13,642
I want to file charges.

415
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,186
Tell me about it.

416
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,813
I heard her plotting.

417
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,193
Go on.

418
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:27,198
She tried to convince Dax
to take her side against Sisko.

419
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:28,574
(<i> groaning</i> )

420
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,409
And did Dax seem persuaded?

421
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,329
What difference does that make?

422
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,039
I was attacked!

423
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,790
Answer the question.

424
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:41,337
I... I couldn't tell.

425
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:43,421
She was on the fence.

426
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:49,803
Doesn't Kira's behavior seem
a little out of the ordinary?

427
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,305
And the others...

428
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,515
at the staff briefing,
Sisko was bored

429
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:57,435
as if he couldn't be bothered
about running the station.

430
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:59,397
And Bashir...

431
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:03,984
since when is he so concerned
about station politics?

432
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,321
Don't look at me that way.

433
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:08,948
I'm perfectly normal.

434
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:12,285
Yes, I suppose you are.

435
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:16,080
It's time
I had a talk with Sisko.

436
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,623
Odo, wait!

437
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:20,000
Odo!

438
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,378
QUARK:
Wait, Odo!

439
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,422
Odo!

440
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:27,174
I want satisfaction!

441
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:33,055
KLINGON:
We have... battle
for decks... 12.

442
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:37,517
...armory... in the hands...
Captain Tel'Peh

443
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,228
...my death.

444
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,647
But still, I... confident

445
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,482
...gain control
of this ship.

446
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,860
I am weakened by my wounds.

447
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,195
Sisko?

448
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,406
...my enemies closing in.

449
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:54,201
Still... hide...

450
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,453
(<i> chiming</i> )

451
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:57,121
Come in.

452
00:24:57,121 --> 00:25:01,208
KLINGON:
First Officer's Journal, Day 26.

453
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,043
Where's Commander Sisko?

454
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:06,713
In his quarters
where he's safe.

455
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:11,218
Still... been able to hide
a thalmerite device

456
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:15,264
under... beam near
the reactor... deck 26.

457
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,599
Rather... taken prisoner

458
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:22,146
I will blow up this ship
and transport to safety.

459
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:27,026
Perhaps Medical Officer Kee'Bhor
was correct.

460
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:31,113
Our... began when we opened
those energy spheres.

461
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:35,284
All I know
is that Captain Tel'Peh

462
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:38,287
<i>must</i> die!

463
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:40,873
Journal closed.

464
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,582
Sounds like

465
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:45,044
there was a power struggle
on board.

466
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,129
Some sort of attempted takeover.

467
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:48,922
Management by mutiny.

468
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:52,259
Standard operating procedure
on a Klingon vessel.

469
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,261
But awfully unusual

470
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:57,264
for a Federation-run
space station.

471
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,932
Don't worry.

472
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,977
If Major Kira tries anything,
we'll be ready.

473
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,191
When will the other log entries
be available?

474
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:08,984
At the current rate

475
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,153
of processing, it'll take
at least seven more hours.

476
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,322
But the computer's taking it
one entry at a time.

477
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:16,616
I'll set it up
so you can access it as it goes.

478
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,202
Thank you, Chief.

479
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,619
Of course,
Constable.

480
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,288
Don't the Commander and I

481
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,416
always try to make you happy?

482
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,106
What are you doing here?

483
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,400
Chief O'Brien's orders.

484
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,326
SISKO:
Come in.

485
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,293
Commander.

486
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:08,919
Hello, Constable.

487
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,879
How are you today?

488
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,965
Concerned, sir.

489
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,008
On such a fine afternoon?

490
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,969
How inappropriate.

491
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:22,308
Commander, I think
something might be wrong

492
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:24,684
with... some of us.

493
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:27,271
Ever since the Klingon ship
exploded

494
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:29,940
and their First Officer
beamed over

495
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:35,821
certain behaviors and attitudes
have been... abnormal.

496
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:40,618
(<i> clearing throat</i> )

497
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:42,578
There appears
to have been

498
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:45,498
a mutiny on the
Klingon ship.

499
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:47,082
I wouldn't go
so far as to say

500
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,876
the same thing is
happening on DS9

501
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:56,216
but I... do find some
disturbing parallels.

502
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:59,094
If something's
bothering you, Odo

503
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,221
tell it to Mr. O'Brien.

504
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,307
That's what he's there for.

505
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,647
What do you think?

506
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,071
What is it?

507
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,615
A clock.

508
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:26,288
Fascinating, isn't it?

509
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:47,685
It's not nice
to keep a friend waiting.

510
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:51,522
Did we have an appointment?

511
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,944
When have I ever had to stand
on ceremony with you, Odo?

512
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:04,451
I need your help.

513
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:09,873
I took care of the Valerians.

514
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,417
What do you mean?

515
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,252
I locked down
their docking clamps.

516
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:16,255
That ship isn't leaving
until I say it is.

517
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:20,426
O'Brien will need at least a day
to do anything about it.

518
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:22,302
By then, it won't matter.

519
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,682
You're going after Sisko.

520
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,768
And O'Brien.

521
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:33,355
Either we get a more reasonable
Commander from Starfleet--

522
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:36,233
someone we can control--

523
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:38,485
or we go it alone.

524
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,404
With me running this place

525
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:43,823
you will be able to do
what needs to be done.

526
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:46,910
If you want to toss
Quark out on his ears

527
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,454
toss him out.

528
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,163
If you want to proclaim
martial law

529
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,873
on the Promenade,
proclaim it.

530
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,460
This station will be yours
to protect

531
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,503
with no interference.

532
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,423
What's your plan?

533
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:03,969
Oh, Odo...

534
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:07,556
I trust you more than
anyone on this station

535
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:10,476
because you can't
be corrupted.

536
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,396
But this is
a dangerous time.

537
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:17,650
I can't take any
chances, even with you.

538
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:21,528
When the time comes

539
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,489
you'll know it.

540
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:29,286
I'll be counting on you.

541
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:40,255
Computer, open a channel
to Starfleet Headquarters.

542
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:43,592
Subspace communication
to Federation territories

543
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:45,385
is currently unavailable.

544
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,679
Why?

545
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,681
By authority of Major Kira.

546
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:50,390
Ah...

547
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,227
Open a channel
to the Bajoran Council.

548
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:57,731
Communication to Bajor
is currently unavailable.

549
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:00,734
By authority of Chief O'Brien.

550
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:04,029
That is correct.

551
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:07,324
Computer, are you finished
reconstructing the journal

552
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:10,118
of the Klingon First Officer?

553
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,329
Data interpolation is complete.

554
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,331
On screen.

555
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:17,000
Computer, scan the journal

556
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,548
for mention of contact
with any alien race.

557
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,174
One entry found.

558
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:26,426
Play it.

559
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:30,848
First Officer's Journal, Day 22.

560
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:35,310
Exploration of the fifth planet
proved to be a waste of time.

561
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,814
This world is not worthy
of a Klingon colony.

562
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:42,568
All we found were
a collection of energy spheres

563
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:46,279
which possess some type
of telepathic archive.

564
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,575
The spheres described
an ancient power struggle

565
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:52,911
that destroyed a race
called the Saltah'na.

566
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:56,456
We will forward our results
to our science division.

567
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:02,921
O'BRIEN:
Kira's already locked
down the Valerian ship

568
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,464
and she's diverted

569
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,800
half the station's systems
to her control.

570
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,967
Since when?

571
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,386
An hour ago.

572
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:11,012
I've heard some
disturbing rumors

573
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,514
from our people
on the Promenade.

574
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:18,061
I think she's going to make
an attempt on your life.

575
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,275
I want you to arrest them--

576
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:26,194
Kira and every Bajoran
officer on this station.

577
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,655
I want the name
of every sympathizer.

578
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,241
That's not
a good idea, sir.

579
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:36,204
There's a lot more of them
than there are of us.

580
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:39,708
If we tip our hand,
it might work against us.

581
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,086
What can we do?

582
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,546
Leave the station.

583
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,256
Never! Get me a phaser!

584
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:47,925
I'll get rid of Kira!

585
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:49,802
Hear me out, sir.

586
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:52,930
We leave the station,
raise a Federation attack force

587
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,347
and return.

588
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,682
And, on that day

589
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:59,269
we'll get rid
of all your enemies.

590
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,860
How do we proceed?

591
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,446
I'll need a few more hours
to free up the Valerian ship.

592
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:11,490
I've already talked
to their Captain.

593
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:15,619
He's more than happy to take us
back to Federation space.

594
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,788
(<i> whispering</i> ):
Call me as soon as you're ready.

595
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:28,006
It'll take effect
in two minutes.

596
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,383
Plenty of time
to get a good...

597
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,677
(<i> door opens</i> )

598
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:37,891
Plenty of time for you
to get a good night's sleep.

599
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:39,643
Thank you, Doctor.

600
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,314
Chronic insomnia.

601
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,232
I think it's hormonal.

602
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,985
So, how are you?

603
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:51,112
I take it you've completed
your autopsy of the Klingon.

604
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,238
Of course.

605
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,782
You know, Odo

606
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:56,075
events have been moving
rather rapidly

607
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,536
since our last conversation.

608
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,454
I'd advise you
to choose sides now

609
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,248
or risk finding yourself
without any friends at all.

610
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,501
The Klingon, Doctor--
what did you find?

611
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:07,212
He's still dead, if
that's what you mean.

612
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,339
I don't have time
for jokes.

613
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:15,470
Your findings could determine
who controls this station.

614
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,640
How?

615
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,475
All in good time.

616
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:24,229
First, tell me
about the Klingon.

617
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:29,943
Well, I found
nothing very unusual.

618
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:32,487
The columnar cells
in his brain stem, perhaps.

619
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,781
The membrane permeability
was off.

620
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:35,949
What could cause that?

621
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,659
Any number of things.

622
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,578
Could it have something
to do with telepathy?

623
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,121
The Klingons were studying
the telepathic archives

624
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,498
of an ancient race.

625
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,000
If those archives
were contained

626
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,335
in a self-sustaining
energy matrix

627
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:51,214
that could explain the changes
in the Klingon's brain.

628
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:54,175
Could that energy matrix
have somehow caused them

629
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:58,179
to reenact the power struggle
that destroyed the Saltah'nans?

630
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,848
Possibly.

631
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,558
What are you getting at?

632
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:04,061
Doctor, I believe
the Klingon

633
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:06,063
brought the matrix
with him

634
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:08,440
and everyone in Ops
was affected except me.

635
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,150
Without a humanoid brain,
my system rejected it.

636
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,613
An interesting theory,
Constable

637
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:18,867
but I'm certainly not behaving
out of the ordinary.

638
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,954
Of course not

639
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:24,081
but what if you and I

640
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:27,250
are the only two
who aren't affected?

641
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,003
Do you think we could use this
to our advantage?

642
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:32,338
Exactly.

643
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,007
Tell me your plan.

644
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:36,593
The first thing we have to do
is figure out

645
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:38,553
how to remove the field
from everyone affected.

646
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,430
Then we'd lose our advantage.

647
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:43,182
Would you prefer that someone
blew up the station?

648
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,601
I see your point.

649
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:45,978
The power to control

650
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:47,479
the energy matrix

651
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:50,482
is the power
to control this station.

652
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:53,234
If I could determine the natural
resonance frequencies

653
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,028
of this telepathic field

654
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:56,738
I might be able to generate
an interference signal

655
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,073
which could drive it out.

656
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,658
Do it.

657
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:03,036
I promise, Doctor,
you won't regret it.

658
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,378
O'Brien,
what's taking so long?

659
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,505
Almost there, sir.

660
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:14,965
We've got one more level

661
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:16,633
of security lockouts
to break through

662
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:18,301
and the Valerian ship
will be ready to go.

663
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,846
Commander, I have
the report you asked for

664
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,305
on those weapon scanners.

665
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,057
Give it to Mr. O'Brien.

666
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:27,894
I really think you
should see this, sir.

667
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,521
Commander!

668
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,901
Dax to Kira.

669
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,449
Is it Kira?

670
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,617
Did Kira put you
up to this?

671
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,327
No.

672
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,761
I want the truth!

673
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,805
Is that clear?!

674
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:11,437
Let's see how this works.

675
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,776
Put it down...

676
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,361
sir.

677
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,415
Take them.

678
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:56,149
Dax, you were supposed
to deactivate the transporter.

679
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:57,901
I forgot.

680
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:00,486
Damn it, Kira must have
set up a force field

681
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,197
to keep us from beaming
onto the Valerian ship.

682
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:03,489
The transporter
rerouted us here.

683
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,992
We've got to get
to that ship.

684
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,577
Odo's our only chance.

685
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:10,455
He might be able
to override the field.

686
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,540
You're sure we
can trust him?

687
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,001
I don't see
that we have any choice.

688
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,211
Sisko to Odo.

689
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,132
Odo here.

690
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:21,340
Kira has moved against us.

691
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,634
She has Dax on her side.

692
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,803
We need your
help, Constable.

693
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:28,140
You've got to clear us a path
to the Valerian ship.

694
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,226
Take Crossover Bridge 1
to the cargo bay entrance

695
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,685
into Docking Port Four.

696
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:33,979
I'll keep it open for you.

697
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:35,981
Right. Sisko out.

698
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,400
Leave your combadge here.

699
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:44,156
Don't look so
worried, Chief.

700
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:46,241
She hasn't beaten us yet.

701
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:48,160
Yes, sir.

702
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,121
They're still
in Airlock Corridor 6.

703
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:53,331
What could they
be doing in there?

704
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,874
Maybe they've given up.

705
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,252
Sisko would
rather die...

706
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,254
which is fine with me.

707
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:02,174
Oh...

708
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:05,010
they must have taken
off their combadges.

709
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,636
That's all right.

710
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,429
They won't get far.

711
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,890
Someone's taking out
our force fields.

712
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:17,314
KIRA:
Whoever it is knows how
to override the security codes.

713
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:24,321
Kira to Odo.

714
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:27,615
Go ahead, Major.

715
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,243
Whose side are you on,
Constable?

716
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:31,661
Yours, of course.

717
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:33,454
Really?

718
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,665
Then why are you helping
Sisko escape?

719
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:37,792
On the contrary.

720
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:41,171
You'll find him trapped
in Cargo Bay 4.

721
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:43,589
Consider it my gift to you.

722
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,133
Oh, my apologies.

723
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,843
We'll see you there.

724
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:48,553
Kira out.

725
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,596
Well done.

726
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:53,099
You certainly fooled her,
didn't you, Constable?

727
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,852
We're running out
of time, Doctor.

728
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:57,354
I'm just about finished.

729
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:59,898
I've set up an ionic
interference signal

730
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:02,234
in Cargo Bay 4,
calibrated to lock on

731
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:05,611
to the resonance frequencies
of the telepathic field

732
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,031
and drive it out
of all those affected.

733
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:10,033
And what will happen
to it then?

734
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,617
Well, it'll remain suspended

735
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,912
as long as the interference
is in effect.

736
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,163
That's all I
need to know.

737
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,289
Let's go.

738
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:25,673
What's wrong?

739
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:26,841
It's been sealed.

740
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,467
I wouldn't do that, sir.

741
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,428
You might run into Kira.

742
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,306
She must have realized we
removed our combadges by now.

743
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,648
It's completely locked down.

744
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:45,235
Someone's activated
a level-5 security protocol.

745
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:49,114
There's only one other person
on this station besides yourself

746
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:50,656
has that kind of access.

747
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,075
Odo!

748
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:53,868
KIRA:
Relax, Commander.

749
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:57,163
He'll be here any minute.

750
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:00,541
So, this is how it all ends.

751
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,002
For you.

752
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:08,758
You know what disturbs me?

753
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:11,386
The ingratitude.

754
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:18,226
I offered you my kindness,
my help, my leadership

755
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:21,729
and how do you repay me?

756
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,606
With betrayal.

757
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:27,485
But you won't
get rid of me so easily.

758
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:31,114
You see, unlike you,
I understand history.

759
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:33,699
My name will blaze
across the stars

760
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:36,661
long after your petty
treacheries have been forgotten.

761
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:39,372
But you won't
be here to see it.

762
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:42,334
Major, wait!

763
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:43,668
Glad you two could make it.

764
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:45,878
Computer, execute Odo One.

765
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,630

766

768
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:11,070
Constable?

769
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:14,532
Everybody grab hold
of something secure.

773
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:58,701
Welcome back, everybody.

774
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:10,713
<i>Commander's Log,</i>
<i>Stardate 46924.5.</i>

775
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,757
<i>With nothing to contain it</i>

776
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:15,427
<i>the telepathic matrix</i>
<i>has dispersed in space.</i>

777
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:17,345

778
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,764
<i>everything and everyone</i>
<i>aboard DS9</i>

779
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,849

780
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,153
Did you really build that?

781
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:36,155
Apparently so.

782
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,574
Why?

783
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:40,952
I have no idea.

784
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:44,372
I know that none of us
was really responsible

785
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:48,084
for our actions, but...

786
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:50,462
I feel I owe you an apology.

787
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:52,297
For attempted mutiny.

788
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:54,340
Well...

789
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,800
yes.

790
00:43:57,176 --> 00:44:00,096
I think we'll let it go...

791
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:02,098
this time.

792
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:14,986
